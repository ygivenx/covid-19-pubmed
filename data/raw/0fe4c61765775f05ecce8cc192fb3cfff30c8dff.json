A novel coronavirus designated \"SARS-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)\" was responsible for the serious infectious disease (Drosten et al., 2003; Fouchier et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Poutanen et al., 2003) . Although the global outbreak of SARS was controlled and the virus had been isolated from wild animals (layan palm civets and raccoon dogs), the actual natural reservoir for SARS-CoV is still unknown and its reemergence in the future remains a possibility. To better prevent future SARS epidemics, protective vaccines and reliable diagnostic reagents must be developed to control this life-threatening disease.\n\nB cell epitopes are defined as regions on the surface of the native antigen that are recognized and bind to B cell receptors or specific antibodies. These epitopes are the focus of immunological research as well as the targets of development of vaccine and diagnostic reagent (Vanniasinkam et al., 2001; Viudes et al., 2001) . Therefore, in the present study, we screened and identified specific B cell epitopes of SARS-CoV using phagedisplayed peptide library, Fab fragments from anti-SARS-CoV immunoglobulin G (IgG) and normal human IgG as targets, and an improved biopanning procedure. The immune responses induced by the four epitope-based peptides were also evaluated with animal experiments.\n\nThe product of serum treatment, anti-SARS-CoV IgG Fab (45 kDa) was shown by ELISA and Western blotting to bind specifically to SARS-CoV antigen. The immunoscreening with the two IgG Fab targets enriched the phage population binding to anti-SARS-CoV IgG Fab. Of 60 selected phage clones, 43 (72%) immunopositive clones had significant enhancement of binding activity to SARS-CoV-specific antibodies but not to normal human serum (Fig. 1) . The homology between peptide sequences of a series of epitopes inserted into target phages and the primary sequence of the structural protein of SARS-CoV was compared ( Table 1 ). As seen in Table 1 , the double selection process resulted in 12 different peptides, which could be divided into three groups: (1) nine peptides with homology to nine different regions of the SARS-CoV S protein; (2) two peptides with homology to two regions of the M protein; and (3) one peptide without any homology to the SARS-CoV structural proteins. Some peptides showed a striking resemblance (as its peptide sequence SHVPLATSRTLA contained six matches to the M protein sequence) and were isolated more than once (SHVPLATSRTLA was sequenced five times, Group 2 in Table  1 ). The majority of epitopes were isolated after both screens.\n\nAfter general evaluation of these epitopes with bioinformation software, four predominant epitopes of SARS-CoV S protein were selected and the corresponding epitope-based peptides (MAP1, 91 ATEKSNVVRGWV 102 ; MAP2, 424 NTRNIDATSTGN 435 ; MAP3: 458 PFSPDGKPCTPP 469 ; and MAP4, 1065 HEGKAYFPREGV 1076 [according to AAT74874]) were synthesized. To prove that the phage-borne peptides were the real epitopes of SARS-CoV, a peptide competitiveinhibition assay was performed to determine whether the synthetic peptide and the corresponding phage clone competed for the same antibody-binding site. In competitive-inhibition assay, the peptides dose-dependently blocked the binding of the corresponding phage clones to the targets (Fig. 2) . Moreover, the four peptides reacted with SARS-CoV-specific serum antibody and did not cross-react with anti-HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 sera or healthy donor sera (Fig. 3 ).\n\nThe antibody responses elicited by the epitope-based peptides were determined using ELISA. Titers of the antisera from challenged mice are shown in Fig. 4 . Every epitopebased peptide stimulated antibody production, even after just primary immunization. A second immunization substantially increased antibody titer within a week. The specific antibody was still detectable on day 42 with high titer suggesting that a strong and relatively long-term humoral immune response was induced by each of the four B cell epitopes. These anti-peptide antibodies reacted with SARS-CoV antigen specifically but failed to react with HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 antigens (Fig. 5) .\n\nThe effects of these peptides on splenic lymphocyte subsets isolated from challenged mice were analyzed using two-color flow cytometry. On day 14 or day 21 after primary immunization, the relative numbers of CD3 \u2212 CD19 + B cells increased significantly and that of CD3 + T cells decreased relative to control group levels (Table 2) . Although both the number of CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells decreased simultaneously, the decrease was greater in the latter than the former. Consequently, Fig. 1 . Identification of specific phage clones reactive with anti-SARS-CoV serum by ELISA. 1-30 represent the ELISA results reacted between different phage clones selected by immunoscreen and patient serum mixture/normal human serum mixture. 31 represent the results between wild type phages as negative control and serum samples above. After four rounds of biopanning twice, 43 phage clones from 60 selected phage clones were significantly reactive with anti-SARS-CoV serum, but not with normal human serum. A and B represent respectively the immune reactivity of phage clones picked at random from the first and the second time that phage cloning was carried out. The negative control reacted with neither patient serum mixture nor normal human serum mixture. the ratio of CD4 + T cell/CD8 + T cell was a little higher. However, the increase in CD4 + T cell/CD8 + T cell ratio was similar in the control group and all MAP-immunized groups, except the MAP2-immunized group on day 14. It suggested that these epitope-based peptides did not imbalance the immunological system. Subsequently, with the activation of T cells, the T cell/B cell ratio progressively returned to a normal level in all groups except the MAP2-immunized group at a low level. The results demonstrated that humoral immune response was predominant and was rapidly triggered by the epitope-based peptide, especially by MAP2.\n\nSince the expression of surface molecules, CD44 and Lselectin, on CD4 + T cells was used to distinguish memory cells ( high CD44, and low L-selectin), we monitored these phenotype changes using three-color flow cytometric analysis. The CD4 + T lymphocytes of epitope-based peptide-immunized mice (day 0, just before the third immunization) showed the classical immunological memory phenotype ( high CD44, and low Lselectin) (Fig. 6 ). With the re-injection of the specific peptide, CD62L was continuously up-regulated (but its level was always lower than that of the PBS control). Slight down-regulation of CD44 on CD4 + T cells stimulated by MAP1 and MAP4 on day 1 was observed; and then the level of CD44 returned to that on day 0, but subsequently fluctuated and remained higher than that of the PBS control. CD44 was continuously up-regulated on CD4 + T cells from MAP2 and MAP3 challenged mice.\n\nThe frequency of IL-4-or IFN-\u03b3-producing cells at the single cell level was determined by ELISPOT assay. As shown in Fig.  7 , 7 days after primary immunization with MAP2 and MAP4, the number of IL-4-producing cells from spleens increased significantly (36-88 spots in 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells). Fourteen days after primary immunization with MAP1 and MAP3, the number of IL-4-producing cells remained elevated (31-43 spots in 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells). Moreover, the number of IL-4-producing cells in mice boosted with any of the peptides increased 2-to 3-fold, whereas the number of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells remained at low levels (10-20 spots in 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells). These data demonstrate that the four B cell epitopes were more effective enhancers of humoral immunity than cellular immunity. The results of antigenspecific lymphocyte cell proliferation assay indicated that each MAP dose-dependently stimulated a proliferative response and MAP3 was the most effective inducer of lymphocyte proliferation (Table 3) . Splenic lymphocytes from mice on day 42 still exhibited significant proliferative responses to specific antigen, demonstrating that the four epitope-based peptides induced long-term immune responses (data not shown).\n\nPhage-displayed peptide libraries have a wide variety of uses (Cortese et al., 1995; Petersen et al., 1995; Pereboeva et al., \n\nNote. Each screen consisted of four rounds of panning with affinity-purified target antibodies. The numbers on either side of the sequence denote amino acid sequence numbers. Letters in bold denote matches of phage sequences with the SARS-Cov sequence and italicized bold letters denote conservative substitutions. The numbers on the right indicate the number of times the corresponding peptide was isolated and the numbers in parenthesis refer to the screen at which the peptide was isolated, i.e., the first screen, the second screen or both. a The corresponding phage clone was chosen for competitive-inhibition assay. 1998; Wu et al., 2001) . This technique has been used mostly to screen with monoclonal antibodies, and little to screen with purified polyclonal antibody preparations (Folgori et al., 1994; Kay et al., 1993; Roberts et al., 1993; Liu et al., 2004) . We were successful in screening with polyclonal antisera using this technique, probably because of the newly improved biopanning we adopted and the targets we chose. Anti-SARS-CoV serum contains mostly SARS-CoV antibodies and few antibodies to other pathogens. In conventional biopanning processes with anti-SARS-CoV sera as the only targets, nonspecific phage clones that do not bind to SARS-CoV-specific immunoglobulins but instead to antibodies specific to other pathogens might be amplified. In addition, some researchers reported that nonspecific clones not binding to the target but to the plastic of plate could also be chosen in several conventional biopanning procedures (Adey et al., 1995) . We improved the biopanning procedure to avoid these possibilities and ensure specificity of selection. Anti-SARS-CoV IgG Fab (as the simplest fragments with specificity of antibodies) facilitated the antigen specificity of our biopanning procedure.\n\nBy repeating the four-round biopanning, we were able to select eleven SARS-CoV epitopes. They formed a subset of the linear epitopes. Moreover, we found another peptide sequence displayed by an immunopositive phage clone without homology to any primary sequence of SARS-CoV proteins. The structure of epitopes recognized and bound by B cell receptor (BCR) was shown to be linear or spatial by the classical experiments of Michael Sela 30 years ago (Sela, 1969) . Phagedisplayed peptide libraries are generated by shotgun cloning of random oligonucleotides into the 5\u2032 ends of either the pIII or pVIII genes of filamentous phage. The peptides encoded by inserted nucleotides are displayed on the phage surface and have independent spatial structure (Cwirla et al., 1990; Luzzago et al., 1993) . So the non-homologous peptide sequence might reflect the presence of a discontinuous epitope of SARS-CoV. In addition, SARS-CoV is antigenically crossreactive with other viruses, so the non-homologous peptide sequence might be also an epitope of a different virus. Certainly, this finding must be studied further. Among the linear epitopes, nine (81%) were considered to be S protein epitopes (five epitopes in S1 protein and four in S2 protein) and two (18%), M protein epitopes. The decrement tendency of numbers of epitopes of S1 protein, S2 protein, and M protein connected with the location of these proteins in the virion. Most (60%) of the epitopes were located in regions where predicted epitopes were known to exist, and a minority (24%) of epitopes were located about 6\u221213 amino acids away from the predicted epitope regions (Yuxian et al., 2005; Yanbo et al., 2003 Yanbo et al., , 2004 . And two were located in regions where the virus binds to the host cell receptor (ACE-II) .\n\nS protein is responsible for inducing host immune responses and virus neutralization by antibodies (Holmes, 2003; Navas-Martin and Weiss, 2003) , and neutralizing antibodies can protect mice or primates from SARS-CoV infection (Bisht et al., 2004; Buchholz et al., 2004; Bukreyev et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2004) . Our research provided an indirect proof that the S protein of SARS-CoV is an important surface antigen stimulus of the host immune response. The M proteins of other coronaviruses are immunogenic (Enjuanes et al., 1995) .The virion structure of SARS-CoV, B cell epitope characteristics, and our B cell epitope results suggest that M protein of SARS-CoV also plays an important role in inducing antibody production.\n\nWe sought to characterize the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV epitope-based peptides to facilitate the development of effective SARS diagnostics and vaccines. Recent studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses are antigenically cross-reactive (Ksiazek et al., 2003; Woo et al., 2004) . The four S protein epitope-based peptides were proven SARS-CoV specificity, and antibodies from mice induced by them also reacted specifically with SARS-CoV. Though further study of their specificity and sensitivity is needed, these epitopes should be considered potential immunoreactive epitopes for diagnostic reagents.\n\nThe immunological effect of epitope-based peptides was studied. The lymphocyte proliferation assay showed the four epitope-based peptides stimulated the immune system. Secretion of IL-4 (a B cell growth and differentiation factor) might reflect the state of activation and proliferation of B cells and transition to antibody-producing plasma cells. The increase was dramatically greater in the number of IL-4-producing cells than in the number of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells after immunization with these epitope-based peptides, confirming that humoral immunity was predominant. So, the epitopes we selected are real B cell epitopes. The specific antibody induced by the four epitopes persisted at least 6 weeks, which was confirmed by monitoring IgG titer. Although specific IgG could be detected after primary immunization, persistent high titer IgG required revaccination. It indicated the involvement of humoral immune memory. Within 1 week after revaccination, B cell numbers peaked, which indirectly proved that antigen-specific memory B cells could be induced by these epitope peptides. It suggested that Lymphocytes were from the mice immunized with the four different peptides on 14 days, 21 days, and 35 days after primary immunization (n = 5). Results are means \u00b1 SD. a P value < 0.01 compared with the control group. b P value < 0.05 compared with the control group. Fig. 6 . Three-color flow cytometric analysis of surface markers (CD44 and CD62L) expression on CD4 + T cells isolated from the spleens of immune mice before (on day 0) and after (on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) the third immunization with MAP1-4. Gates were set on the CD4 + T cells. The experiment was repeated three times with the same overall results. The values within each box indicate the relative cell number. these epitopes were potential for development of SARS vaccine. MAP2 and MAP4 induced rapid increase in the number of IL-4-producing cells to enhance the humoral immune indicated their potential uses for emergent prophylaxis of SARS; MAP1 and MAP3 induced relatively slow but persistent increase in that to enhance humoral immune indicated their potential uses for long-term prophylaxis of SARS. Since activated Th (CD4 + T) cells are also needed for effective humoral immunity, Th cells will be activated rapidly with the help of immune memory. In the mice, CD62L (Bradley et al., 1992; Yin et al., 1991) and CD44 (Budd et al., 1987; Butterfield et al., 1989 ) are used to distinguish naive from memory cells, and naive from activated T cells (Gerberick et al., 1997) . In our study, in epitope-based peptide-immunized mice, the classical phenotype of immunologic memory (CD44 high , and L-selectin low ) was present on the surface of CD4 + T lymphocytes just before the third immunization (day 0), suggesting that these epitope-based peptides could enhance the CD4 + T memory cell response and thereby increase immune surveillance, defense, and capacity to carry out their auxiliary functions when specific antigen reappeared.\n\nBecause excessive or depressed immune responses can result in immunologic derangement and adversely affect the body, it is important to know whether epitope can keep steady state of the immune system especial for its using as constituent of vaccine. So we monitored the change in lymphocyte subsets numbers of splenic lymphocytes. Happily, the safety of the four B cell epitopes was confirmed.\n\nOur study provided several SARS-CoV epitopes along with their immunological characteristics. These four epitopes had the ability to induce rapid, strong, and long-term humoral immunity, and they were also safe and effective at least in mice. Therefore, the four epitopes might have potential use as constituent of SARS vaccine. Moreover, our limited studies on antigenic specificity of the four epitopes suggested their potential use as diagnostic biomarkers. In addition, S and M proteins were important surface antigens of SARS-CoV confirmed by our results of immunoselection of B cell epitopes.\n\nAnti-SARS-CoV serum samples were collected from 8 convalescent-phase SARS patients (the diagnostic criteria for SARS-CoV infection followed the clinical description of SARS released by the World Health Organization) within a month after recuperation, tested positive for SARS-CoV antibody using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Huada Company, Peking, China). Antibody titers varied from 1:320 to 1:1280. Normal human serum samples (SARS-CoV seronegative) were pooled from seven blood donors. The 229E and OC43 standard strains of human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43) and their specific antisera of murine origin were obtained from the Guangdong Center for Disease Control (CDC).\n\nFour epitope-based dodecapeptides were synthesized in the form of an eight-branch multiple antigen peptide (MAP) construct (purity > 85%; HuaCheng Company, Xi'an, China) and the coincidence of the actual molecular mass with the theoretical molecular mass was confirmed by mass spectrography analysis.\n\nFemale 6-to 7-week-old BALB/c mice were purchased from the Centre of Experimental Animals Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China. The Animal Experiment Ethics Committee of Sun Yat-sen University approved the protocols of all experiments performed in this study. All animals were handled according to the guidelines of the Chinese Council on Animal Care.\n\nImmunoglobulin G (IgG) from convalescent and normal human serum was purified respectively using an affinity column, protein A Sepharose CL-4B (DingGuo Company, Peking China). Fab fragment of IgG (IgG Fab) was prepared by digestion of intact IgG with caroid, and then the digest was rechromatographed using another protein A Sepharose CL-4B column. The purity of the targets was checked by SDS-PAGE and their antigenicity was determined using ELISA and Western blotting. Human IgG and IgG Fab (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used as references, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat antihuman IgG and IgG Fab (Sigma) were used as detector antibodies in these identifications. The binding activity to SARS-CoVantigen of the target molecules was determined using ELISA.\n\nTo enrich phage clones specific for anti-SARS-CoV IgG Fab, we improved the conventional biopanning procedure. The first round of biopanning was performed on immobilized anti-SARS- 0.3 \u00b1 0.1 0.4 \u00b1 0.1 0.6 \u00b1 0.1 8.5 \u00b1 1.2 FA control 0.8 \u00b1 0.3 1.9 \u00b1 0.4 3.0 \u00b1 0.3 12.5 \u00b1 0.8 a BAL B/c mice were injected twice with 100 \u03bcg of epitope-based peptides in the form of MAP constructs. Mice receiving 300 \u03bcl of PBS or CFA served as negative controls. On day 7 after final immunization, splenocytes for the lymphocyte proliferation assay were pooled from immunized mice. b Values are from one representative experiment out of five performed and are presented as the mean stimulation index (of quadruplicate wells) \u00b1 SD.\n\nCoV IgG Fab to ensure all phage clones binding to it were included in the pool of the first screen. In other words, 4 \u00d7 10 10 phages of the original library (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) were immunoscreened with anti-SARS-CoV IgG Fab for 1 h at room temperature. Unbound phages were removed by washing and the bound phages were eluted with glycine-HCl (0.2 M, pH 2.2, and 1 mg ml \u2212 1 BSA) and neutralized with Tris-HCl (1 M, pH 9.0). After titration on LB/IPTG/X-gal (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) plates and amplification, 4 \u00d7 10 10 firstround selected phages were immunoscreened with normal IgG Fab and the unbound phages were collected to remove phages not specific for anti-SARS-CoV IgG Fab in the second biopanning. The protocols for the third and fourth immunoscreen were identical to that of the first round except 2 \u00d7 10 11 phages particles were used as input and the Tween 20 concentration was increased for washing to 0.5% (v/v). The four rounds of biopanning were repeated once.\n\nThirty blue plaques from each fourth-round titration plate were picked at random, amplified in host bacteria (E. coli ER2738), and precipitated with polyethylene glycol (PEG)/ NaCl. ELISA was performed on 96-well plates coated respectively with 10 \u03bcg ml \u2212 1 anti-SARS-CoV serum mixture and normal human serum mixture. After blocking, 10 12 phage particles of each clone per well were incubated for 2 h. Then, the plates were washed at least six times with TBST (0.5%). HRPconjugated anti-M13 antibody (Pharmacia, Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA), diluted in BSA blocking buffer (1:5000), was added to the plates and incubated for 1 h. After washing and reacting with substrate 2, 2\u2032-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) for color development for 20 min in the dark, the absorbance at 405 nm was measured in a Microplate reader (Multiskan MK3, Thermo Labsystems, Shanghai, China). The equal amount of wild type phages was used as a negative control simultaneously. Immunopositive phage clones were preserved as target clones for further study.\n\nSingle-stranded DNA (prepared from each target clone as template) and the \u2212 96 gIII primer were used for sequencing. Sequences of DNA inserted into target phage clones were translated into amino acid sequences and compared with that of structural proteins of SARS-CoV (AAS48453, AAS48454, AAS48455, AAS48456, AAU07933, AAT74874, etc.) which were retrieved from the Genebank site (www.NCBI.NLM.NIH. GOV/) using Standard protein-protein BLAST and Clustal W Multiple Sequence Alignment public software. We analyzed several properties of these epitopes including hydrophilicity, antigenicity, accessibility, flexibility, polarity, and secondary structure and chose four predominant epitopes (dodecapeptides) to synthesize for further study.\n\nCompetitive-inhibition assay. In competitive-inhibition experiments, coating with anti-SARS-CoV serum, blocking, and washing were performed as above. Different amounts of the four synthetic peptides and their corresponding phage clones were added simultaneously and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Then the same steps as above were followed and absorbance was measured. The inhibition percentage was calculated as follows: inhibition% = [(OD 405 without competitor \u2212 OD 405 with competitor)/OD 405 without competitor] \u00d7 100%.\n\nBinding assay. To assess the specificity of the epitope-based peptides, their ability to bind to normal human, anti-SARS-CoV, anti-HCoV-299E, and anti-HCoV-OC43 sera were examined by ELISA. Each of the above antisera was incubated (1 h, 37\u00b0C) in ELISA wells coated with 10 \u03bcg ml \u2212 1 epitope-based peptides. After being washed, the wells were incubated with corresponding HRP-conjugated second antibody for 1 h, then ophenylenediamine (OPD) to develop the color, and finally, optical density (OD) values at 492 nm were measured.\n\nFor monitoring specific antibody titer, cytokine levels, and lymphocyte proliferation, mice were randomly divided into six groups (one group for each of the four peptides, one for the PBS control, and one for the Freund adjuvant (FA) control, n = 5). Mice were immunized subcutaneously with 100 \u03bcg of peptide as immunogen in the presence of Freund complete adjuvant and boosted with freshly prepared emulsion of the immunogen and Freund incomplete adjuvant at 2-week intervals. Generation of immunological memory in mice was by a second immunization and was followed by an 8-week rest period. For the study of the CD4 + T cell recall response, mice with immunological memory were immunized with 100 \u03bcg of peptide without adjuvant (Akbar et al., 1993) for a third time.\n\nBlood samples were obtained from the lateral tail vein of mice on days 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 after primary immunization. Antibody titer was measured using synthetic peptides as coating antigens for an IgG ELISA. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viral suspension with a titer of 5 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 ml \u2212 1 was used to prepare the virus antigen. Antibody specificity was determined from the IgG ELISA reactivity of sera with the antigens, SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, respectively.\n\nSpleen was cut into pieces and carefully forced through a metal mesh. For flow cytometric analysis, splenocyte suspensions were treated with 1\u00d7 RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) to lyse erythrocytes, then washed and suspended up to concentration of 2 \u00d7 10 7 cells ml \u2212 1 in staining buffer (D-PBS pH 7.0/0.2% NaN 3 /5% calf serum). For the enzyme-linked ImmunoSPOT (ELISPOT) and lymphocyte proliferation assays, lymphocytes were separated from the splenocyte suspensions by density gradient centrifugation and suspended (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells ml \u2212 1 in RPMI 1640). All lymphocyte samples were prepared and used freshly.\n\nFifty microliters of suspended lymphocytes prepared as above, which were harvested, respectively, from twice-immunized mice on days 14, 21, and 35 after the first immunization and from boosted memory mice on days 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 after the third immunization, were incubated with a panel of antimouse antibodies against the surface molecules fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated CD3e, phycoerythrin (PE)conjugated CD19, CD4, CD8a, allophycocyanin (APC)conjugated CD44, and CD62L (L-selectin, eBioscience). After incubation at 4\u00b0C for 20 min in the dark, cells were washed three times before being suspended in 4% paraformaldehyde and analyzed using a BD FACS Aria\u2122 instrument (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Antibody-isotyping control flow cytometric analyses were carried out essentially in the same manner. The data were analyzed using BD FACSDiva software.\n\nAssessment of peptide-specific IL-4-or IFN-\u03b3-producing cells using the ELISPOT technique IL-4-or IFN-\u03b3-producing cells were assessed by specific ELISPOT kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (U-Cytech, Utrecht, The Netherlands). Briefly, 100 \u03bcl of lymphocytes from immunized mice on days 7, 14, 28, and 42 after primary immunization were incubated with corresponding peptides or PHA at a final concentration of 5 \u03bcg ml \u2212 1 in wells coated with captured interleukin-4 (IL-4) antibody or interferon\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) antibody after the wells were washed and blocked. After proper incubation at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 , the cells were removed by washing, and the secreted cytokine was detected with biotin-labeled anti-murine IL-4 or IFN-\u03b3 monoclonal antibody. The spots were counted with an automatic reader.\n\nOne hundred microliters of prepared lymphocytes was cultured in quadruplicate in 96-well plates in the presence of 100 \u03bcl of the corresponding peptides at final concentration of 2.5 \u03bcg, 5 \u03bcg, and 10 \u03bcg ml \u2212 1 , respectively, and the control PHA was at 10 \u03bcg ml \u2212 1 . After incubation (37\u00b0C, 68 h), 100 \u03bcl of supernatant was removed and 10 \u03bcl of 3-(4, 5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, 50 \u03bcg ml \u2212 1 ) was added. After further incubation for 4 h, the lymphocytes were lysed (100 \u03bcl of dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO] , room temperature for 20 min) for developing color and the OD values at 570 nm were measured.\n\nStudent t test was used for statistical analysis."}
