{"title": "", "body": "The microtopography of the small bowel is extensively modified, to increase its surface area, by spiral mucosalfolds in some species, and by villi projecting into the lumen. The villi, projections of lamina propria covered by a layer of epithelium one cell thick, expand the absorptive surface of the small bowel 7-14-fold. In most species, villi are tallest in the duodenum, and decline somewhat in height toward the ileum.The length and shape of villi in \"normal\" animals vary with the species, age, intestinal microflora, and immune status. In general, villi in dogs, cats, neonatal piglets, and ruminants tend to be tall and cylindrical; those in horses and in young ruminants tend to be moderately tall and cylindrical; villi in weaned ruminants and swine may be cylindrical, leaf or tongue-shaped, or rarely ridgelike, with their broad surface at right angles to the long axis\" of the gut. Length of villi typically declines somewhat after weaning.\n\nOpening on to the mucosal surface around the base of each villus are several crypts of Lieberkiihn. These are straight or somewhat coiled (depending on the species and the proliferative status) tubular gland-like structures, lined by a single layer of epithelium. The progenitor compartment of the enteric epithelium resides here, producing cells that differentiate and move up on to the surface of villi, mainly as absorptive enterocytes, ultimately to be extruded as effete cells from the tips of villi. Sloughed cells contribute to the enzyme content and complexity of the intestinal luminal content. Stem cells are present in the crypts; depending on species and the position in the gastrointestinal tract, they are near or at the base of the crypt. They divide to produce four main lineages of cells. Poorly differentiated enterocytes, which are cuboidal or low columnar, with relatively few, short microvilli, are the predominant type of cell lining crypts. Especially in the lower half of crypts, these cells form a population that cycles rapidly, undergoing amplification division. One of the ensuing daughter cells usually differentiates and moves into the functional compartment of absorptive enterocytes on the villus. Undifferentiated crypt epithelial cells also secrete electrolytes and water.\n\nOligomucous cells, derived by mitosis from the basal stem cells, also form a population undergoing amplification division. They contain mucous granules, and are intermediate in structure between undifferentiated crypt epithelium and goblet cells, into which they mature.Well-differentiated goblet cells are present in crypts and on the surface of villi, with variable prevalence and distribution at various levels of the intestine, and in the different species. They have basal nuclei and secrete mucus, apparently by exocytosis, from the luminal border of the cell. Intestinal mucus is a gel that lubricates and probably serves to \"insulate\" the surface from organisms, which it may entrap or immobilize. It contains trefoil factor, also produced by the goblet cell, which promotes epithelial restitution or gliding after erosion; lysozyme and defensins produced by Paneth cells; and immunoglobulin A secreted into it by epithelial cells. Goblet-cell hyperplasia and mucus secretion are promoted by a variety of noxious stimuli, by inflammatory mediators, and by cell-mediated immune events in the gut. Production of trefoil factor may be related to the preponderance of mucous cells often present in healing mucosa.\n\nPaneth cells, a population of enigmatic cells turning over slowly ('-~20 days) in the base of the crypts in small intestine, are most obvious in horses, among the domestic animals. They are not found in dogs, cats, or swine, and they are not prominent in the intestine of ruminants. Eosinophilic secretory granules are present in the apical cytoplasm of Paneth cells. They contain a number of antimicrobial proteins and peptides active in innate host defense, including lysozyme, phospholipase, DNAse, ribonuclease, and alpha-defensins. Adaptive increases in Paneth cell numbers and activity are initiated by T cells and proinflammatory cytokines.\n\nThe fourth type of cell found in intestinal crypts is the enteroendocrine cell. They too are derived from crypt stem cells, and comprise a heterogeneous population of over a dozen amineor peptide-secreting endocrine/paracrine cells, representing about 1% of the crypt cell population.These are the cells variously recognized as enterochromaffin, argentaffin, or argyrophil; the specific cell type is defined by immunocytochemistry and the ultrastructure of secretory granules. Hormones with relatively clearly understood functions, such as secretin and cholecystokinin, as well as peptides or amines whose endocrine or paracrine implications are still being revealed, are secreted. With the exception of carcinoid tumors of serotonin-secreting cell origin, and rare functional neoplasms of other enteroendocrine cells in humans, the pathologic implications of this class of cells are still very poorly defined.\n\nEnterocytes, which are responsible for the final digestion and absorption of nutrients, electrolytes, and water, are by far the predominant cell type on intestinal villi. They are normally tall columnar cells, polygonal in cross-section, with a regular basal nuclear polarity. A tight junction, which is nevertheless \"leaky\" to small molecules and water, joins the apical margins of adjacent cells. The barrier to transepithelial macromolecular movement is essentially maintained even at sites of extrusion of effete enterocytes at the tips of villi. Basal to the tight junction, the lateral cell membranes interdigitate loosely, and a long, narrow potential space exists between enterocytes. The basolateral cell membrane is the site of sodiumpotassium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase that drives the sodium pump, and of carrier systems exporting monosaccharides from the cell. Absorptive epithelial cells lie on a basal lamina with which they interact via integrins, which may be involved in communications with the underlying mesenchyme. Immediately beneath the basal lamina lies the sheath ofsyncytial myoflbroblasts that produce the basal lamina, and with which enterocytes also appear to interact. Myofibroblasts seem to be involved in intestinal organogenesis, and epithelial proliferation and differentiation, as potent sources of growth factors.\n\nThe apical surface of normal enterocytes is highly modified into microvilli, about 0.5-1.5 Ixm long and 0.1 Ixm wide, which are regularly arrayed in close apposition to each other at right angles to the surface of the cell.They are visible as the \"brush border\" by conventional microscopy. Microvilli increase the surface area of absorptive epithelium by a factor of about 15-40 times. The plasmalemma of microvilli is studded with massive numbers of enzyme molecules, including aminopeptidases and disaccharidases involved in terminal digestion of peptides and carbohydrates. These protrude as minute \"knob-like\" structures into the glycoprotein \"glycocalyx\" that coats the surface of microvilli.\n\nIn neonatal swine and ruminants, vacuolation of absorptive enterocytes is normal, and the nucleus is often also displaced into the apical cytoplasm. In piglets vacuolation is usual in the ileum, but not in the duodenum, and seems to be a function of cell age. Such The cytoplasm of absorptive enterocytes is stabilized at the apical border by the filaments of the terminal web. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is most prominent in the upper half of cells, while cisternal elements of rough endoplasmic reticulum are more uniformly distributed. The Golgi zone lies above the nucleus. Free ribosomes and polyribosomes are numerous in differentiating cells of the upper crypt and lower villus, and are relatively fewer in mature absorptive enterocytes.\n\nThe complex of endoplasmic membranes and Golgi apparatus is particularly active in handling absorbed lipid, which diffuses from micelles at the cell surface, through the apical membrane, in the form of long-chain fatty acids or monoglyceride.These are re-esterified to triglyceride, appearing in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and are complexed with apoproteins produced in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, to be excreted, via the Golgi apparatus, through the basolateral cell membrane as chylomicrons. Chylomicrons enter the extracellular space, and leave the villus via the lacteal. The lamina propria, a highly plastic mesenchymal stroma, supports the epithelium of the small intestinal mucosa. It is composed of loose fibrous tissue, through which course blood vessels, and in which smooth-muscle, inflammatory, and immune-active cells are interspersed. In addition to functioning in defense against microorganisms, macrophages phagocytose inert particulate matter reaching the lamina propria from the lumen. Bile pigment, perhaps derived from meconium, is sometimes seen in macrophages in the tips of villi in neonates. Macrophages may become iron-laden and, by loss from the mucosa, may play a role in iron homeostasis.Apoptotic bodies, ceroid, hemosiderin, and bile pigment may also be present in histiocytes in the lamina propria at tips of villi, which are particularly prominent in horses, and should not be mistaken for foci of necrosis. These may represent detritus resulting in part from apoptosis of upwardly migrating subepithelial myofibroblasts at the villus tip. Myofibroblasts are probably largely responsible for the remarkable plasticity of the villus during adaptive changes expressed as villus atrophy and reconstitution of mucosal three-dimensional morphology.\n\nLymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils are scattered in the lamina propria of villi and between crypts. Eosinophils are especially common in the intestine of ruminants and horses, with no specific pathologic connotation, but they are highly variable in prevalence in the intestine of small animals. Intraepithelial lymphocytes are frequently found between epithelial cells on villi, and, less commonly, in crypt lining. Globule leukocytes may be found in the epithelium of crypts and low on villi, or sometimes in the lamina propria between crypts. Plasma cells are normally not numerous in villi, but are concentrated in the lamina propria between the upper portions of crypts.\n\nThe vascular supply to the small intestinal mucosa arises in submucosal arteries that give off arterioles at right angles, some of which send branches to a capillary plexus around crypts of Lieberkiihn.The majority pass up the centers of villi, arborizing near the villus tip into a dense capillary plexus which lies immediately beneath the basal lamina of the epithelium. Capillaries in villi have fenestrations facing the basal lamina, which may be more permeable than the remainder of the endothelium. One or more venules drain blood from the capillaries in villi and between crypts, and flow into larger veins in the submucosa, which drain into mesenteric veins and the hepatic portal circulation. The lacteal, or central lymphatic vessel of the villus, is sufficiently permeable to permit the entry of macromolecules and chylomicrons, and is the main route of lipid transport from the villus.\n\nThe cecum and colon vary widely in anatomy and size among domestic animals, depending largely upon the significance of microbial fermentation of carbohydrate in the hindgut. Production of volatile fatty acids from carbohydrate by colonic flora occurs in all species. In the horse, this is a primary source of energy, and it is significant in swine and ruminants as well. Extensive movement of electrolytes and water occurs across the colonic wall. In the horse, a volume of fluid approaching that of the extracellular fluid space of the animal may be in the large bowel, which must maintain a fluid medium for microbial fermentation; daily fluid absorption from the hindgut may exceed the extracellular fluid volume. Absorption of electrolytes and water, an electrolyte-conserving mechanism, is probably the major function of the colon in dogs and cats, and of the distal colon of herbivores.\n\nThe mucosa of the cecum and colon in all domestic species lacks villi, though there are ridges or folds on the mucosal surface.The surface of the hindgut is lined by a single layer of columnar absorptive epithelial cells with basal nuclei. These cells generally have more sparse and less regular microvilli in comparison with absorptive cells of the small bowel, and numerous glycoprotein-laden vesicles are in the apical cytoplasm in most species. Typical goblet cells are also interspersed on the colonic surface in variable numbers, depending on the species and a variety of other factors.\n\nColonic crypts, or glands, are straight tubular structures. The architecture of colonic glands and their cell population resembles somewhat that of small intestinal crypts. Epithelial cells, which contain small glycoprotein-laden vesicles, differentiate progressively from stem cells in the crypt to absorptive epithelium as they approach the surface. Oligomucous cells, derived from basal stem cells, form a second proliferative population in the lower half of the colonic gland.\n\nWell-differentiated goblet cells are usually present in the upper half of glands in the large bowel, as well as on the surface. Enteroendocrine cells of about a half-dozen types have been recognized, scattered in the cell column lining glands in the large bowel.\n\nThe lamina propria of the colon is minimal between closely packed glands. It contains a cell population similar to that in the small bowel. Normally, relatively few inflammatory and immuneactive cells are present in the superficial mucosa in small animals and young herbivores; most plasma cells and lymphocytes are between deeper portions of glands. Older herbivores may have somewhat heavier superficial proprial inflammatory infiltrates, and macrophages containing phagocytosed debris may be present below the surface epithelium between the mouths of glands, especially in the horse. In the equine colon, terminal arterioles that enter the mucosa branch at right angles from the submucosal plexus. Capillaries ramify to surround colonic glands, and form an anastomosing network at the luminal surface. Sparsely distributed venules drain the superficial capillary plexus.\n\nThe connective tissue of the submucosa lies between the mucosa and the external muscle of the gut, which is comprised of inner circular and outer longitudinal layers, made up of fascicles of smoothmuscle cells.An extensive enteric nervous system, with submucosal (Meissner's), and myenteric (Auerbach's) plexuses marked by ganglia, modulates external autonomic neural regulation and coordinates gastrointestinal motility and function. The neurons of the enteric system equal in number those in the spinal cord, and their ramifications sense and influence epithelial absorption and secretion, local endocrine/paracrine secretion, blood flow, immune events, and motility in the gut. Secretomotor neurons ramify axons that extend to individual crypts of Lieberkiihn, where they stimulate secretion of electrolyte, water and mucus. Excitatory and inhibitory effects are mediated by acetylcholine and by amine and peptide neurotransmitters, such as substance R adenosine triphosphate and vasoactive intestinal peptide, which in some cases are also produced by endocrine cells of the gut and pancreas. In addition, myofibroblastic pacemaker cells of the intestine, known as interstitial cells of Cajal, are distributed throughout the intestinal musculature, integrated with the extrinsic and enteric nervous systems.Abnormalities of these cells are thought to lead to disorders of motility, and to gastrointestinal stromal tumors, a specific entity described in horses and dogs. Disorders of motility associated with enteric neural lesions, such as the dysautonomias and grass sickness, are discussed in the section on intestinal obstruction, below.\n\nInterpretation of intestinal and colonic biopsies is often subjective, unless clear-cut diagnostic criteria can be met: by recognition of an etiologic agent; a specific cell type; a characteristic pattern of inflammation or anatomic abnormality, such as lymphangiectasia; or cytologic and morphologic abnormalities indicating malignancy.\n\nThere are significant variations in the microscopic morphology of the gut among individuals and between species, and with age; at different levels of the small and large intestine within species and within the same individual; and as a result of factors influencing \"physiologic\" inflammation in the mucosa. Limited morphometric data are available, describing in a quantitative manner the \"normal\" morphology of the intestinal mucosa and its epithelial and inflammatory cell populations in domestic animals. However, until more such information is available, and its application, particularly in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, is validated, pathologists would do well to expand their experience of \"normal\" intestinal morphology by close examination of tissues from animals in which gastrointestinal disease is not indicated clinically, and to view critically their reliability in diagnosing such entities. The various grading schemes suggested for interpretation of inflammatory lesions of the stomach and intestine leave much to be desired in terms of objectivity and potential for interobserver variation.\n\nBiopsy interpretation is enhanced by increased size of specimen; increased numbers of specimens; the sampling of all layers of the bowel wall; minimal trauma, rapid fixation, and optimum orientation. Sacrifice of any of these attributes increases the subjectivity with which a biopsy is interpreted. Hence, in dealing with endoscopic and other small biopsies, care must be taken in handling to reduce traumatic artefact and to optimize orientation. Clinicians and pathologists dealing with endoscopic, capsule, and forceps biopsies must remember the limitations in interpretation imposed by small sample size; difficulties in orientation; the frequent failure to sample the deep mucosa; and the usual failure to sample the submucosa and muscularis. These costs are offset to some degree by the opportunity to obtain a greater number of samples than may be possible by other means, at arguably lower risk and cost, and possibly more \"focused\" on a lesion by direct endoscopic examination.\n\nThe gastrointestinal tract is presented continually with antigens in food; ingested toxins; viruses; bacteria and their products; and parasites and their excretions and secretions. The epithelial barrier of the gut is but one cell thick and has enormous surface area; the enteric mucosal surface of the average human is about 400 m 2. Therefore, it is not surprising that the epithelium and associated lymphoid and inflammatory cells in the mucosa and submucosa have evolved a complex system for excluding, blocking, sampling, tolerating, or neutralizing and eliminating antigens. At birth, intestinal immune elements are sparse and quiescent; immune activity in the gut is probably stimulated in response to colonization by normal bacterial flora beginning in the early neonatal period. In the mature animal, lymphoid tissue has been estimated to comprise 25% of the intestinal mucosal mass, and to exceed that of the spleen in volume.\n\nInnate and adaptive elements of the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier include, physiologically, volume of secretion and peristalsis, which dilute and flush the contents, and gastric and bile acids and pancreatic secretions that break down ingested antigens. The indigenous microflora competitively inhibit, or actively exclude, intruding bacteria. Mucins on the luminal surface form a secretory barrier, and retain trefoil factor, antibody and soluble components of innate resistance, including those produced by Paneth cells. The epithelium provides a physical barrier; participates in innate resistance by production of proinflammatory cytokines; enables passive immunity by antibody uptake in the neonate; and by antigen uptake and presentation may contribute to active immunity. Intraepithelial lymphocytes presumably act as a first line of defense. Soluble antibody in plasma and interstitial fluid neutralizes antigens penetrating the mucosal barrier and contributes to opsonization/phagocytosis, as do endogenous components of the innate immune system, such as complement. The organized elements of the mucosal immune system, Peyer's patches, and other mucosal lymphoid follicles, are sites of induction for intestinal immune responses, generating antigenactivated B and T cells that ultimately home back to the mucosa. Within the lamina propria reside populations of such B and T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Regional lymph nodes receive and trap free and phagocytosed antigens, and antigen-presenting cells activate more B and T cells, promoting mucosal and systemic immunity. Escape of viable infectious agents past the mesenteric lymph nodes permits systemic disease.\n\nThe epithelial cell of the neonate is capable of uptake and transport of macromolecules from the intestinal lumen to the basolateral cell surface. In all species of domestic animals, colostral transfer of immunoglobulins by this route provides the neonate with passive humoral immunity during the early postnatal period.The period of active uptake ofmacromolecules is short, usually only 24--48 hours in ungulates, and \"closure\" precludes further bulk transport of macromolecules.\n\nAlthough bulk transport does not occur, nutritionally inconsequential amounts of macromolecules continue to be transferred by enterocytes in mature animals. For uptake to occur, molecules must escape intraluminal hydrolysis, and pinocytosis must exceed the rate of lysosomal degradation to permit molecules to be exported from the cell. Fully differentiated small intestinal absorptive epithelial cells express on their basolateral membranes major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, as do antigen-presenting macrophages and dendritic cells. Enterocytes are probably capable of directly presenting antigen to T cells. As well, via pattern recognition moleculessurface Toll-like receptors and cytosolic nucleotidebinding oligomerization domain (Nod) molecules-they detect highly conserved molecular structures (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) produced by luminal bacteria, and some viral components, activating cellular production of proinflammatory or immunomodulatory cytokines.\n\nIntestinal intraepithelial T lymphocytes form a large population strategically located between intestinal epithelial cells, adjacent to the basement membrane. They may comprise up to 10-20% of the cells within the epithelial layer. In domestic animals they are comprised mainly of cytotoxic T cells, with a small minority of CD4 + and ~/~ T cells. They presumably function as a front line of defense, reacting, as part of the innate response, to bacterial and plant products such as amylamines, and to damaged enterocytes. They also presumably participate as components of the adaptive response, responding to antigens entering from the lumen and in tumor surveillance. Some may kill compromised epithelial cells. Most, but not all, intraepithelial lymphocytes appear to originate in Peyer's patches. Globule leukoeytes are visible in hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections as mononuclear cells with large eosinophilic cytoptasmic granules, in the epithelium of the crypt and lower villus, and sometimes in the lamina propria.Their origin has been uncertain. Formerly postulated to be derived from mast cells, the weight of evidence suggests that they are granular lymphocytes. infest Specific epithelial cells called \"M\" cells, associated with Peyer's patches and intestinal lymphoid follicles, actively \"sample\" particulate matter and macromolecules impinging on the mucosal surface. M cells are interspersed among other cells of the follicle-associated epithelium resembling absorptive enterocytes, on the surface of the \"dome\" in the mucosa overlying lymphoid aggregates in the submucosa. They often adopt an inverted \"cup\" shape, with one or more lymphocytes and occasional macrophages, in the basal concavity, in contact with the membrane of the M cell. Material taken up by M cells is transmitted to the associated lymphocytes or macrophages. Despite, or perhaps because of, its role in adaptive immunity, the M cell is exploited as a likely portal of entry to the mucosa by certain pathogenic bacteria, including Salmonella, Yersinia, and Listeria in some species, and for some viruses. Neutrophils are seen transmigrating the epithelium of the dome, and are found in the lumen over the dome, in enteric bacterial infections of calves in particular.\n\nThe aggregated lymphoid follicles, or Peyer's patches, are scattered in the mucosa of the small intestine, and lymphoglandular complexes or solitary proprial lymphoid nodules may be grossly visible, studding the colonic mucosa. Peyer's patches are present throughout the length of the small intestine in all species, though they tend to be larger distally. They are grossly visible, usually as oval or elongate structures up to several centimeters wide, thickening the antimesenteric wall of the intestine. They may project slightly above the mucosal surface, or appear as cupped depressions, which must not be mistaken for ulcers, especially in dogs. In neonates of some species, including swine, they may be poorly developed and not visible grossly. Elongate continuous Peyer's patches are found in the distal ileum, involving the terminal 15-20% of the small intestine, in calves, lambs, and piglets. This structure is different morphologically and functionally from other gut-associated lymphoid tissue, and may be a primary site of B-cell generation. Continuous Peyer's patches involute as the animal matures.\n\nPeyer's patches are comprised of follicular aggregates orB Iymphocytes in the submucosa, underlying a discontinuous muscularis mucosae. Between the upper borders of adjacent lymphoid follicles are aggregates ofT lymphocytes. Overlying the lymphoid follicles is a mixed population ofT and B lymphocytes extending into the lamina propria in rounded mucosal projections, the domes, which lie between villi. Short crypts provide epithelium to domes and adjacent villi. Cell populations of Peyer's patches in newborns and gnotobiotes of most species tend to be sparser than those in older or bacterially colonized animals, though those in neonatal calves appear relatively well developed.\n\nB and T immunoblasts gain access to Peyer's patches via permeable postcapillary venules, mediated by specific receptors in the postcapillary venules. The major cell populations in Peyer's patches appear to be B lymphocytes committed mainly to IgA production, while among the T cells is a large proportion ofT helper cell precursors. Antigen is processed and presented to lymphocytes in Peyer's patches largely by dendritic cells. The cytokine context within which dendritic cells function may determine whether, in response to presentation of a soluble antigen, they induce a persistent clone of activated lymphocytes, or it is deleted, causing tolerance. Alternatively, under some conditions dendritic cells may induce clones of regulatory suppressor T cells, mediating tolerance. Mesenteric lymph nodes play a crucial role in the induction of mucosal immunity and tolerance. Antigen presentation by dendritic cells trafficking to the nodes from the gut, or trapping antigen, perhaps associated with apoptotic enterocytes, draining via lymphatics, is more important than in Peyer's patches. Dendritic cells in the liver may also play a role in inducing tolerance. Macrophages are less common in Peyer's patches than in lamina propria, and their role in the interaction among M cells and T and B lymphocytes is unclear. They probably play an effector role in cell-mediated reactions to bacteria entering via Peyer's patches, and certainly in response to agents such as Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis and Histoplasma capsulatum, found in the lamina propria.\n\nIn the lamina propria, dendritic cells scattered beneath the epithelium throughout the gut can sample the intestinal luminal content directly by extending dendrites between enterocytes, without compromising the integrity of the mucosal barrier. They may also sample the environment by taking up antigen presented by enterocytes, or by phagocytosing apoptotic enterocytes. Macrophages and dendritic cells may present antigen to sensitize proprial lymphocytes, and promote cytokine production. Macrophages also sequester iron, inhibiting bacterial metabolism. Macrophages in colonic lamina propria are highly phagocytic, but have a low ability to activate T cells and promote T-cell-mediated immune responses. Proprial T cells are mixed CD4 + and CD8 +, most numerous between upper crypts and in the propria of villi, and are likely antigen-activated cells. Cytokine production by these cells is probably determined by the cytokine milieu, but evolution of interferon-y, tumor necrosis factor-or, and interleukins-1, -4, -5, -8 and -13, activating macrophages and promoting inflammation, are likely. IgA lymphoblasts leave the Peyer's patch for the mesenteric lymph node and, via the thoracic duct, the general circulation, whence they home on the intestinal mucosa and other mucosal surfaces, including the respiratory tract, mammary gland, and salivary glands. In the lamina propria of the intestine they differentiate into IgA-secretory plasma cells, found mainly in close apposition to columnar epithelium of the upper crypt. Dimeric IgA binds via the J chain to glycoprotein \"secretory component\" present on the basolateral border of columnar crypt epithelial cells.With secretory component, it is transported in vesicles through the cytoplasm to be released from the apical border of the cell into the lumen of the crypt. It then spreads over the intestinal surface, partly bound to mucus.\n\nIgA-secreting cells are the predominant class of plasma cell in the lamina propria in most species. However, IgM-secreting plasma cells are prevalent in young calves, swine, and dogs. IgM is also taken up by secretory component in some species and transported to the intestinal lumen. This may be significant in the young piglet and calf.Although IgA and IgM are secreted, IgG1 is the major antibody class in intestinal secretion in cattle; it appears to be selectively secreted by the gut and in the bile in that species. The function of IgA in the gut lumen probably lies mainly in blocking attachment by bacteria and viruses to epithelial cells, neutralizing intraluminal toxins, and in limiting absorption of antigens originating in food and produced by microorganisms in the gut. It thereby reduces the likelihood of reaginic and other forms of immune response in the propria. Secretion into the bile, by hepatocytes, of lgA complexed with antigen may, in the species in which it occurs, be a significant means of clearing the circulation of antigen absorbed from the gut. IgA deficiency is reported in Beagle, German Shepherd, and Shar-Pei dogs, where it is associated with increased susceptibility to parvoviral infection, and chronic small intestinal and respiratory disease.\n\nPlasma cells containing IgG are relatively uncommon in the intestinal lamina propria in species other than ruminants. However, locally produced and systemically circulating IgG may assume significance when vascular permeability and inflammation occur, due to its ability to fix complement, facilitate antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity, and to opsonize.\n\nPlasmacytes producing IgE are present in the lamina propria, in small numbers in most species. This class of immunoglobulin has been particularly implicated in immune responses to some intestinal parasites. Its significance may be in IgE-dependent cytotoxicity by eosinophils and perhaps by mast cells, as well as in mediating immediate (type I) hypersensitivity reactions in the mucosa.\n\nIntestinal mucosal mast cells differ histochemically and physiologically from mast cells in most other tissues. They are not as demonstrable using standard stains after formalin fixation as are connective tissue mast cells from other tissues; they stain well in tissue fixed in basic lead acetate or Carnoy's fluid. They contain only tryptase, but no chymase, in contrast to connective tissue mast cells, and their granules are few, and variably, rather than uniformly, electron-dense under the electron microscope. Proliferation of intestinal mast cells is T-cell-dependent, and is prominent in some parasitisms. Histamine, serotonin, and other mediators released by mast cells have many and complex effects on vascular tone and permeability; on motility, chemotaxis, and effector function of leukocytes; on immune-active cells; and possibly on mucus release. Mast cells interact with the enteric nervous system, sensing antigen with their IgE immune probe, and communicating with the sensory arm of the enteric nervous system by degranulation, releasing stimulatory soluble mediators.They undoubtedly play a central role in regulation of physiologic, immune, and inflammatory processes in the gut. The enteric nervous system also modulates cytokine release by T cells, through interactions involving a variety o\u00a3 neuropeptides for which T cells have receptors. Peptide release by neuroendocrine cells may also impact on T-cell activity, as well as on intestinal function.\n\nIntestinal eosinophils probably do not differ functionally from eosinophils in other sites, being cytotoxic effector cells and modulators of local inflammation.\n\nImmunoinflammatory events in the large bowel are less well understood than those in the small intestine. Presumably, similar principles prevail. Lymphoglandular complexes, consisting of submucosal follicular lymphoid aggregates penetrated by glands extending from the mucosa, occur in the cecum and proximal colon of the dog; in the porcine colon; at the cecocolic junction, beginning of the spiral colon, and in the terminal rectum, in ruminants. Epithelium lining the glands is in close contact with lymphocytes. Solitary mucosal lymphoid nodules, normally without penetrating glands, and generally restricted to the lamina propria and superficial submucosa, are also scattered throughout the cecum and colon in all species. \n\nAfter birth, no part of the gastrointestinal tract is sterile. Hundreds of species of commensal bacteria, many of them unidentified, inhabit the stomach and intestine, forming an ecosystem of enormous complexity, in which yeasts, fungi, and protists participate in many circumstances. This ecosystem ferments exogenous and endogenous substrates, often those not within the competence of host epithelium to absorb, producing energy in the form of short-chain fatty acids, synthesizing vitamins, and converting amino compounds to ammonia. Four niches are recognized: (1) the lumen; (2) unstirred su~ace mucus; (3) mucus deep in crypts; and (4) the sueace of enterocytes.\n\nGenerally, bacterial populations are least in the stomach and upper small intestine of ruminants and carnivores, being limited by the acid gastric environment and by peristalsis. The anaerobes and facultative anaerobes increase to about 10 7 per gram of content in the lower small intestine, and total bacterial populations in excess of 101\u00b0 or 1011 per gram of content are present in the cecum and colon. Prominent among colonic bacteria are coliforms, Lactobacillus, and strict anaerobes, including Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Eubacterium, Bifidobacterium, and Peptostreptococcus. Spirochetes are found in swine and dogs. Anaerobic bacteria outnumber facultative anaerobes by a thousand-fold in the large bowel.\n\nThe complex ecology of the gut flora imparts upon it considerable stability, and if disturbed it tends to return toward the original state. It is relatively resistant to the intrusion of new inhabitants and this is one of the major factors protecting against the establishment of pathogenic bacteria. It is no coincidence that bacterial diarrhea occurs most commonly in the neonate with a poorly established flora, or after changes in husbandry or antibiotic therapy which may disturb the enteric bacterial population.\n\nThe normal flora acts as a barrier to colonization by pathogens through several means. The secretion of proteins such as colicins has little significance in modulating enteric bacterial populations; more important is the production of acetic and butyric acids by the anaerobes. Under the pH and redox conditions in the large bowel, short-chain fatty acids are highly detrimental to members of the Enterobacteriaceae. The high population of lactobacilli in the gut of milk-fed animals probably reduces the establishment of Enterobacteriaceae by this means. Facultative anaerobes are important in maintaining the redox environment for strict anaerobes, by scavenging oxygen. Competition for energy, and the effect of metabolites other than short-chain fatty acids produced by the native flora, militate against establishment by exogenous bacteria. Host factors influencing gut flora include composition of the diet; peristalsis, which continually flushes the small intestine of a large proportion of its bacterial population; lysozyme; lactoferrin; gastric acidity if unbuffered or undiluted; and, in the abomasum of suckling calves, perhaps a lactoperoxidase-thiocyanide-hydrogen peroxide system.\n\nThe use of probiotics, deliberate oral administration of specific microbial cultures, has been shown to improve body weight gain and decrease diarrhea in newborn calves and pigs, as well as to protect adult animals from colonization with certain pathogens, including Escherichia coli O157:H7 and some Salmonella spp.\n\nThe enteric microbial flora promotes the development of a population of inunune and inflammatory cells in the lamina propria, by antigenic stimulation. Mucosal epithelial kinetics are also sped up in conventional animals, in comparison with those which are germfree. IgA secretion into the lumen may influence populations close to the mucosa, and immune activity as a whole must limit establishment on and ingress by microorganisms and their products into the mucosa, as well as establishing tolerance for normal members of the ecosystem. Lactogenic immunity similarly has an inhibitory effect on enteric organisms to which specific antibody is present in ingested milk. \n\nWater movement in the bowel is passive, following osmotically the transport of electrolyte and nutrient solutes.The small intestinal mucosa is highly permeable to the passive movement of small ions and water and is therefore considered \"leaky,\" despite the presence of\"tight\" junctions at the apical margins of absorptive enterocytes. This ensures that the content of the small bowel is approximately isosmolal with the interstitial fluid space.The permeability of junctional complexes appears to be sensitive to Staffing forces, influenced by intravascular hydrostatic and oncotic pressure, so that fluid and solute actively absorbed may leak back into the lumen, thus modulating net absorption by the mucosa.\n\nSodium absorption takes place by a number of active transcellular mechanisms, which vary in importance at different levels of the gut, and with the physiologic circumstance. Fundamentally, Na \u00f7 absorption depends on electrochemical forces established by the adenosine triphosphate-dependent Na \u00f7 pump on the basolateral cell membrane of the absorptive enterocyte. This pump moves Na \u00f7 up a concentration gradient from the cell into the lateral intercellular space.\n\nThe concentration of solute, especially Na+, in the lateral intercellular space, causes water to follow from the intestinal lumen. Since cell membranes and junctional complexes are highly permeable to water, movement is rapid via both transcellular and paracellular routes, and differences in osmotic pressure between lumen and lateral intercellular space are small.Absorbed solute and water in isotonic proportions move into the interstitium of the villus, where, within a few micrometers, they encounter a subepithelial capillary or lacteal. The tight junctions also appear to become permeable during Na+-nutrient cotransport across the apical cell membrane, resulting in solvent drag of large nutrient molecules into the lateral intercellular space.\n\nThe colon of carnivores, the spiral colon of ruminants and swine, and the small colon of the horse are charged with the task of reducing the volume of electrolyte and water lost to the animal in the feces. In contrast to the small intestine, the colonic epithelium is relatively restrictive to the free movement of soclium and chloride, though not to potassium. Therefore it is capable of maintaining differences in osmotic pressure, ionic composition, and electrical potential between luminal and proprial surfaces, which make it more efficient than the small bowel in absorbing some electrolytes and water. Ultimately, fecal water may be hypotonic with respect to plasma.Absorption of volatile fatty acids also accounts for considerable water absorption from the colon. Potassium increases in concentration in colonic content as Na + concentration declines; this is due to an active secretory process, and a passive response to transepithelial electrochemical gradients.\n\nThe mucosa of the small and large intestine, under some conditions, also secretes chloride, potassium, bicarbonate, and water. This process, which can be a function of both surface and crypt cells, is important in some pathologic states; but it is also physiologic, and segmental, maintaining the fluidity and buffering capacity of the intestinal content.\n\nSolute movement across the intestinal epithelium is regulated by a number of hormones and neurotransmitters, which act through intracellular second messengers. Activation of adenylate cyclase and guanylate cyclase, and increased intracellular Ca 2+, all depress nutrientindependent absorption of Na \u00f7 by enterocytes, and open C1-channels in crypt cells, promoting secretion. Some products of intrinsic and extrinsic neurons, such as vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and acetylcholine, may be secretory, while others, such as somatostatin and norepinephrine, are absorptive or antisecretory. Local paracrine effects are mediated by the products of enteroendocrine cells, such as somatostatin, and neurotensin (secretory). Serotonin is secretory, possibly directly, and also through stimulation of local prostaglandin production. In addition, guanylin, a peptide secreted from epithelial cells, acts to increase local fluid secretion. Mesenchymal elements in the lamina propria, including myofibroblasts, lymphocytes, mast cells, macrophages, and other inflammatory and connective tissue cells, also produce locally active substances with a direct or indirect effect on epithelial function. Circulating hormones also influence mucosal function. Mdosterone and glucocorticoids enhance Na + absorption by the colon, and the latter may inhibit local production of eicosanoids.\n\nHence, immunoinflammatory events are integrated with the systemic and local neural and hormonal regulation of intestinal absorption and secretion. Dysfunctions of absorption and secretion will be considered in the section on the pathogenesis of diarrhea, below. \n\nThe intestinal surface is lined by a population of cells ultimately derived from stem cells that are present at or near the base of crypts or glands, but with its proximate source in amplifier populations of undifferentiated columnar or oligomucous cells in the lower half of the crypts. These cells lose their ability to undergo mitosis, and differentiate into goblet cells and the functional population of enterocytes as they move from the crypt to the villus. In most species, they are sheclfrom the tips of villi in about 2-8 days; apoptosis is a minor contributor to physiological enterocyte loss. Generally, cells move off the villus more quickly in the ileum than in the duodenum, perhaps related to the decline in height of villi with distance down the gut in most species. Normally, the mass and topography of the mucosa are quite stable. This steady state is the product of a dynamic equilibrium between the rate of movement of cells out of crypts and on to villi, and the rate at which they are lost from the tips of villi. Equilibrium is based on interaction of the microflora with the epithelium, and presence of cell cycle regulators, especially transforming growth factor-~ and other mediators, including glucagon-like peptide 2, and urokinase, which may facilitate cell shedding.\n\nIn the young animal the intestine grows by generation of new crypts, and with them, new villi. As the bowel attains mature size, the number of villi stabilizes, and apparently remains relatively constant. The number of crypts also stabilizes, but some adaptive variation in the ratio of crypts to villi may occur.Adaptive responses to a variety of factors alter the size and rate of turnover of the proliferative and functional epithelial cell populations and with them the microtopography of the gut.The appearance of the small intestinal mucosa is a compromise, achieved by the equilibrium between the rate of cell production and rate of loss. At one extreme lies the intestine of the germfree animal, with a short crypt containing a small proliferative compartment, and tall villi supporting a large functional compartment with a low rate of cell loss. At the other end of the spectrum is the animal suffering from severe intestinal helminthosis, with long crypts reflecting an increased proliferative compartment, yet a flat mucosal surface with relatively few functional enterocytes and an apparently high rate of cell loss.\n\nAlthough quantitative description of epithelial kinetics is possible experimentally, in the diagnostic situation it is necessary to make a subjective or semiquantitative assessment of the status of the proliferative and functional compartments in tissue sections. The size of the proliferative compartment is reflected in the length and diameter of the crypts, and in the location of the uppermost mitotic cell. The prevalence of mitotic figures can be assessed subjectively, but beyond calculating a mitotic index, no inferences can be drawn about the proportion of the crypt cell population that is replicating, or the duration of the cell cycle.\n\nThe degree of differentiation, and hence functional status, of enterocytes on villi can be inferred from their appearance. Cytoplasmic basophilia; loss of regular basal nuclear polarity; low columnar, cuboidal, or squamous shape; and an ill-defined brush border all point to a poorly differentiated population of surface enterocytes, which is possibly turning over more rapidly than normal.\n\nFasting reduces the mucosal epithelial mass; the atrophy is related to prolongation of the postrnitotic phase of the cell cycle in the proliferative compartment. Villi do not regress severely, however, since cells on the surface persist for twice as long, moving off the villus more slowly.The effect is immediately reversed by refeeding. Weaning also has similar profound effects on the structure of the intestine, resulting in marked reduction in height of villi in most species.\n\nRestitution of epithelial integrity following minor loss of mucosal surface cells is by lateral migration of adjacent intact epithelium, and occurs within minutes. If epithelium on villi is obliterated, for instance by transient ischemia or by viral cytolysis, the villus core contracts, probably due to rnyofibroblast activity mediated by the enteric nervous system, and strornal elements rapidly undergo apoptosis. Surviving epithelial cells become attenuated, and extend across the denuded intercrypt surface. Restitution is positively influenced by local growth factors and especially by trefoil factors present in mucus.\n\nRegeneration of the mucosa follows, as the three-dimensional architecture is restored within a few days, during which the proliferative compartment undergoes hyperplasia, generating new epitheliurn, and the stroma is rebuilt. Extensive rnucosal ulcers will form a bed of granulation tissue, and with time (weeks to months) may become covered by a neomucosa, with crypts and villi, which evolves following the centripetal immigration of flattened epithelium from the periphery of the lesion.A similar process repairs the mucosal gap in healing intestinal anastomoses.\n\nAtrophy of villi is a common pathologic change in the intestine of domestic animals. It results in malabsorption of nutrients, and is sometimes associated with increased plasma protein loss into the gut. Mucosa with short villi can be categorized morphologically into two broad types, recognition of which has implications with respect to pathogenesis and prognosis. The first category includes intestine with apparently normal or hypertrophic crypts, associated with atrophy of villi to various degrees.The second category is comprised of gut with some evidence of damage to the proliferative compartment, and variable villus atrophy. The recognition, evolution, and interpretation of each will be considered in turn.\n\nVillus atrophy with an intact or hypertrophic proliferative compartment takes two forms in domestic animals. A primary increase in rate of loss of epithelium from the surface of villi is one mechanism initiating such a lesion.This is the major pathogenetic action of a number of important viral diseases, including coronaviral and rotaviral infection; of coccidial infections which damage surface enterocytes predominantly; of some enteroinvasive bacteria; of transient ischemia, in which the effect is limited to the functional compartment; and, in some circumstances, of necrotizing toxins released by clostridia in the lumen of the bowel.The effect of these agents is to cause significantly increased loss of surface epithelium over a relatively short period of time, while sparing the proliferative compartment in crypts. Villi contract as the size of the functional compartment is diminished, and they may become very stubby. If the animal survives the metabolic sequelae to the malabsorption that results from the damage to surface cells, compensatory expansion of the proliferative compartment in crypts permits complete recovery. Epithelium emerging from crypts regenerates villi, resulting in a normal mucosal topography within a few days, and full function returns.\n\nThe microscopic appearance of the mucosa depends partly on the number of functional cells lost, which determines the initial degree of villus atrophy, and partly on the amount of regeneration that has occurred by the time the gut is examined. During the early phase of cell loss, damaged epithelium may be seen exfoliating into the lumen of the gut, and villi are shorter or blunter than normal, or sometimes more or less of normal length, but somewhat pointed. Subsequently, the atrophic villi are covered by poorly differentiated, low columnar, cuboidal or squamous cells. There may be fusion of the lateral surfaces or tips of villi in some areas. In severe atrophy there may be mild erosion if inadequate epithelium is available to cover even the much-reduced rnucosal surface area. In the acute phase, crypts appear of normal size, but within 12-24 hours, proliferative activity is noticeably increased. Crypts enlarge in diameter and length to accommodate more mitotic cells, which are basophilic, crowded, and obviously dividing, sometimes very close to the surface of the mucosa. The lamina propria appears moderately hypercellular, perhaps due to condensation, possibly due to a mild mononuclear cell infiltrate. As regeneration occurs, progressively longer villi with increasingly well-differentiated epithelium are evident, and hypertrophy of the proliferative compartment gradually subsides.\n\nAtrophy of villi and hypertrophy of crypts is also associated with chronic or persistent processes such as nematode parasitism; chronic coccidial infection of surface epithelium; giardiasis in some species; response to dietary components in some species, including soybean protein in calves, kidney bean protein in pigs, and wheat in dogs; idiopathic or specific granulomatous enteritis, such as Johne's disease and histoplasmosis; and chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by heavy lymphocytic/ plasmacytic infiltrates in the mucosa. Epithelial kinetics have not been investigated in most of these situations in domestic animals. However, they all have in common chronic antigenic exposure, parasitism, or a persistent infectious process in the lumen, epithelium, or lamina propria, usually associated with a significant lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltrate in the mucosa. Where the etiology can be eliminated, the lesion usually remits, implying that it requires active interaction between host and parasite for its induction and maintenance. The situation is entirely analogous to that of celiac disease in humans, which clearly is an immune-mediated response to specific dietary antigens, through activation of mucosal T cells secreting y-interferon, among other cytokines. Strong evidence implicates Th2 lymphocyte-driven nitric oxide production in the pathogenesis of villus atrophy in experimental helminth infections in mice.The source and effect of the nitric oxide are uncertain, as is its possible interaction with cytokines such as interleukin-12, interferon-y, and tumor necrosis factor-[3, also implicated in villus atrophy of this type in experimental models.T-cell activity seems to be associated with villus atrophy of this type in parasitisms such as giardiasis as well.\n\nImmune reactions in the gut are associated with increased epithelial cell proliferation. Hypertrophy of the proliferative compartment in these conditions precedes the development of villus atrophy, and is not a response to it. Evidence points to local stimulation of the proliferative compartment, and perhaps the associated myofibroblast sheath, by cytokines or nitric oxide released by activated T lymphocytes in the mucosa. Epithelial cells leaving the crypts usually do not differentiate fully. They exfoliate prematurely, low on the villus or near the crypt opening, and as the pre-existing enterocytes are shed, villi undergo atrophy over a period of several days. Epithelium that reaches the surface subsequently fails to differentiate fully, though it may become mucous metaplastic, and is rapidly lost into the lumen, matching the rate of cell production.\n\nHypertrophy of crypts is the early and outstanding change in this lesion, and is consistently present. In its milder forms, the lesion may be better characterized by elongate crypts than by obvious atrophy of villi. The proliferative compartment is expanded and active, and mitotic figures are numerous; goblet-cell hyperplasia may also occur. Elongation of crypts may be so great that even with severe atrophy of villi the total mucosal thickness will not be much reduced from normal. Close observation may reveal poorly differentiated enterocytes exfoliating prematurely from intercrypt ridges on the mucosal surface, or from buttress-like folds around the base of stubby villi. The lamina propria has a prominent population of lymphocytes, plasmacytes, and associated inflammatory cells, and intraepithelial lymphocytes are common.The etiologic agent, in the form of parasites, intracellular bacteria, or yeasts, may be evident. Removal of the causal stimulus, where that is possible, usually results in a return to \"normal\" within days or weeks.\n\nHowever it is induced, atrophy of villi with hypertrophy of crypts is associated with local malabsorption of nutrients and water; elongate crypts and perhaps poorly differentiated surface epithelium may secrete electrolytes and water; and if there is proprial inflammation and microerosion of the mucosa, effusion of tissue fluid may ensue. Increased turnover of epithelium may contribute to enteric loss of endogenous protein.\n\nVillus atrophy associated with damage to the proliferative compartment is also commonly seen in domestic animals. It is the sequel to insults that cause necrosis of cells in crypts, or impair their mitotic capacity. The agents that produce these lesions usually have a propensity for damaging dividing cells in any tissue. Since ionizing radiation was recognized early as a cause of such lesions, they are often termed\"radi0mimetic.\" Other causative agents include cytotoxic chemicals and mitotic poisons, such as cancer chemotherapeutic agents, T-2 mycotoxin, and pyrrolizidine alkaloids in large doses; viruses that infect proliferating cells, particularly the parvoviruses, and Bovine viral diarrhea virus and Rinderpest virus. Ischemia of sufficient duration to cause necrosis of some or all cells lining the crypts also causes a lesion of this type.\n\nThe microscopic appearance of affected mucosa depends on the severity and extent of the insult, and the interval since it occurred. The primary event is damage to the proliferative compartment, and, except in ischemia, lesions will be evident in crypts well before significant atrophy of villi occurs.Apoptotic epithelial cells and neutrophils may be present in the lumen of damaged crypts, which tend to dilate. If crypt cell necrosis is severe, remaining cells become extremely flattened in the course of attempting to maintain the integrity of the crypt lining. Following radiation, cytotoxic damage, and parvoviral infection, bizarre irregular epithelial cells with large nuclei and nucleoli may be present in crypts and will migrate on to the surface.\n\nPre-existing surface epithelium continues to move off the tips of villi at an apparently normal rate, even though few or no new cells emerge from crypts.Villi eventually become atrophic or collapse as the surface cell population shrinks. If most proliferative and stem cells have been damaged, crypts stripped of epithelium will also collapse, or \"drop out,\" perhaps leaving a few scattered cystic remnants, lined by attenuated epithelium, in the deeper lamina propria. The overlying surface will be covered by squamous epithelial cells derived from surviving crypts, or will be eroded; the mucosa may eventually ulcerate, to be lined by granulation tissue. Crypts that have not been so severely damaged will undergo hypertrophy within a week or so of the original insult, as compensatory hyperplasia of lining cells occurs.\n\nIn viral diseases, the severity and appearance of the lesion often vary considerably at different sites in the gut, and even within an individual tissue section. Lesions due to ischemia tend to be uniform in severity but may be localized; acute or subacute lesions are often hemorrhagic, if there has been reflow.\n\nExtensive lesions due to crypt cell necrosis lead to erosion or ulceration, with severe malabsorption, and effusion of tissue fluid and hemorrhage.The mucosa is often invaded by the enteric flora, sometimes including fungi. Local ulceration may lead to persistent plasma loss, and, if circumferential, to stricture and stenosis. Small ulcers in areas where a few crypts have dropped out will heal as epithelium from adjacent crypts moves over the surface, but crypts may not regenerate for some time, and local villus atrophy will persist.\n\nEpithelial turnover in the cecum and colon is fundamentally similar to that in the small intestine, though villi are not present on the su~ce. Cells lose the ability to divide after leaving the proliferative compartment in the lower part of the gland. In the upper portion of the gland they differentiate into goblet cells or columnar absorptive cells that emerge and move out over the surface. They are lost into the lumen, probably within about 4-8 days of being produced, though no studies of colonic epithelial turnover have been made in domestic animals. Fasting reduces, and refeeding restores, proliferative activity in colonic glands in experimental animals, and physical distension and certain types of dietary fiber in the colon also appear to be trophic for the mucosa. The colon of gnotobiotic animals has a small number of proliferative cells, limited to the lower portion of the glands. With conventionalization of the gut flora, the proliferative compartment expands.\n\nRestitution of the epithelial integrity of the surface of the large bowel, following insult to, and exfoliation of, surface cells, resembles that in the small bowel.Within a few minutes of injury, surviving surface epithelium, and cells emerging from crypts, become attenuated and migrate at a rate of several micrometers per minute to extend over mucosal defects. Ulcers, surgical incisions, or anastomotic sites in the colon heal by immigration of a single layer of epithelium from the periphery of the defect, with gradual differentiation of crypts, and eventual restitution of normal mucosal architecture. In the horse, depending on the type of anastomosis, epithelium may take over 2 weeks to bridge the granulation tissue in the gap in the mucosa, and restitution of mucosal architecture may require about 2 months.\n\nLesions in the large bowel presumed to be associated with increased epithelial turnover include alterations in both surface and glandular epithelium. The number of goblet cells on the surface and in the upper portion of glands is often diminished, and epithelium in these areas appears poorly differentiated, is more basophilic than normal, and may be low columnar, cuboidal, or squamous. In severe diseases, microerosion of the surface is present.The proliferative compartment in the gland may hypertrophy, causing glands to elongate and dilate. Crowded mitotic cells are present over a greater proportion of the length of the gland, sometimes virtually to the surface of the mucosa, though in some situations goblet-cell hyperplasia may occur. Such changes may be associated with acute, chronic, or chronic-active inflammation of the lamina propria. It is uncertain whether such changes are caused by primary damage to surface epithelium, or by cell-mediated immune effects on the proliferative compartment, analogous to those that occur in the small intestine in celiac disease of humans.\n\nThe proliferative compartment in the cecal and colonic glands is damaged by the same insults that attack cells in the crypts of the small bowel. However, cytotoxins and parvoviruses tend not to produce severe lesions so commonly in large bowel as they do in small intestine, perhaps because a lower proportion of the proliferative compartment is in mitosis at the time of maximum availability of drug or virus.Additions to the list of agents damaging the proliferative compartment in large intestine include coronavirus in calves, cattle, and dogs, and several species of coccidia in ruminants, which develop in the cells lining glands in the large bowel.\n\nThe evolution and sequelae of lesions resulting from damage to proliferative epithelium in the large intestine are similar to those in small bowel. Dilation of crypts containing necrotic debris, and lined by attenuated epithelium, indicates such damage. Severe lesions will lead to loss of glands, erosion, and ulceration of the mucosa, perhaps with hemorrhage. Stricture and stenosis may ensue. Following milder damage that spares some stem cells in each gland, the mucosa has the potential to recover fully after a period of reparative hyperplasia. \n\nProtein-energy malnutrition, due to intake of too little feed, or of feed deficient in quantity or quality of nutrients, results in depletion of fat and muscle mass, emaciation, and ultimately, death by starvation. In addition, immune function is impaired, predisposing to infection. Inappetence or, in extreme cases, anorexia, are commonly associated with gastrointestinal diseases.Appetite is modulated by a complex and incompletely understood meshwork of neurologic, neuroendocrine, and systemic cytokine inputs impacting centrally on satiety. The potential for physical impairment of gastrointestinal function to affect appetite seems relatively obvious. Less apparent, but highly significant, are the effects on appetite of chronic inflammatory diseases affecting the alimentary system, or distant sites. Possible direct or indirect mediators of this effect are tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-1 released from macrophages and other cells. In addition to simply reducing food intake, they may play a role in the complex metabolic puzzle that is the cachexia, characterized by active erosion of adipose tissue and muscle mass, associated with chronic inflammatory disease and neoplasia.\n\nProtein-energy malnutrition must be differentiated from the effects of endogenous conditions resulting in malassimilation or protein-losing enteropathy, from cachexia induced by chronic inflammatory and neoplastic disease, and from other problems that may result in recumbency.\n\nIn neonates, several factors predispose to death by starvation within the first few weeks of life. These include increased energy demands due to cold and exposure; fetal malnutrition with poor fat depots at birth; and postpartum hyponutrition, which in calves is often associated with poor-quality or insufficient milk replacer. Piglets are born with negligible fat reserves and die quickly of hypoglycemia if not fed adequately. Neonatal ruminants usually have fat depots sufficient to compensate for longer periods of inanition (2-4 days for lambs; 6-10 days for calves), if cold stress is not severe.\n\nIn animals that have died of inanition, muscle mass is reduced, due to mobilization of amino acids for gluconeogenesis. Fat in the bone marrow, coronary groove, on the pericardial sac, and around the kidneys is completely depleted, and has the gelatinous clear pink appearance of serous atrophy. The liver may appear small, with sharp margins, presumably due to reduced trophic stimuli. A diagnosis of starvation is supported by a history of conditions compatible with reduced quantity or quality of feed, and by steps to rule out problems causing malassimilation and protein-losing gastroenteropathy.\n\nDigestion and assimilation of nutrients have an intraluminal phase, mediated by the biliary and pancreatic secretions, and an epithelial phase, carried out by enzyme systems on the surface and in the cytoplasm of absorptive enterocytes.The final step is delivery of the nutrient by the enterocyte to the interstitial fluid, and its uptake into the blood or lymph.\n\nExocrine pancreatic insufficiency is the major cause of intraluminal maldigestion, and it is usually due to juvenile pancreatic atrophy in dogs, or to pancreatic fibrosis and atrophy following repeated episodes of pancreatic necrosis (see Vol. 2, Pancreas). It is occasionally seen in cats. This condition may be complicated by bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine. Bile salt deficiency is rarely seen as a cause ofintraluminal maldigestion in domestic animals.\n\nThe epithelial phase of digestion is impaired by loss of functional epithelial su~ce area. This occurs in short-bowel syndrome following intestinal resection, in which greater than 75-85% of the small bowel has been lost, and, more commonly, in villus atrophy. Neonates and ruminants have low levels of maltase; ruminants lack sucrase. In most species, lactase levels decline with age, and malabsorption in dogs fed milk has been attributed to low levels of lactase. The poorly differentiated surface epithelium present on atrophic villi may lack the full complement of enzymes on the brush border and in the cytoplasm necessary for nutrient digestion and assimilation. Lectins present in uncooked beans attach to and damage microvilli on enterocytes, which may explain the malabsorption and diarrhea associated with their use in feeds; lectins also promote bacterial adhesion and overgrowth in the small intestine.A heritable syndrome of gluten-sensitive enteropathy has been reported in Irish Setter dogs. This entity is characterized by villus atrophy, increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, and abnormal levels of mucosal microvillar hydrolases. Cobalamin malabsorption has been described as a hereditary defect in Beagles, Giant Schnauzers and Border Collies, resulting in anemia and failure to thrive. Delivery of nutrients, especially lipid, to the circulation, may be impaired in lymphangiectasia. The pathogenesis of malabsorption of the major classes of nutrients will be considered briefly.\n\nAssimilation of fat is susceptible to interference at all three phases of digestion and absorption. Lipolysis is impaired if insufficient lipase is available. Most commonly this is a result of pancreatic atrophy or fibrosis. It may also be due to failure by atrophic intestinal mucosa to release the cholecystokinin/pancreozymin necessary for pancreatic secretion. The availability of bile salts for micelle formation is reduced in intrahepatic cholestasis, biliary obstruction, and by depletion of the bile salt pool due to reduced ileal absorption following resection or atrophy. As a result, fatty acid and monoglyceride are not incorporated on to micelles and emulsified; they are therefore not as accessible to absorptive enterocytes. Reduced surface area for lipid uptake will contribute to malabsorption of fat. Poorly differentiated enterocytes on atrophic gut may be less able than normal epithelium to re-esterify long-chain fatty acids to triglyceride and to produce chylomicrons for export from the cell. In lymphangiectasia, granulomatous enteritis, and intestinal lymphosarcoma, lymphatic drainage may be obstructed, and with it the flow of chylomicrons to the systemic circulation.\n\nMalabsorption of lipids may cause steatorrhea (excess fat in the feces). It is seen in monogastric animals, especially dogs. Severe fat malabsorption may result in deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins. Malabsorption of calcium, magnesium, and zinc occurs due to their sequestration in soaps formed by combination with malabsorbed luminal fatty acids. Increased absorption of oxalate, and consequent nephrolithiasis, may be a sequel to reduced concentrations of calcium in the lumen due to soap formation. Malabsorbed lipid may cause colonic diarrhea, by mechanisms that will be discussed subsequently.\n\nMaldigestion of polysaccharides occurs if levels of pancreatic amylase are reduced; this is most commonly encountered in dogs with severe loss of functional exocrine pancreatic tissue. Calves and older ruminants normally lack significant amounts of pancreatic amylase and digest starch poorly in the small intestine. Mucosal oligosaccharidase deficiency occurs in villus atrophy, with reduced mucosal surface area. Poor differentiation of enterocytes results in irregular, short, and sparse microvilli, and a reduced complement of oligosaccharidases. The result is impaired membrane digestion of disaccharide and malabsorption of carbohydrate, much of which is subsequently fermented by colonic flora.The osmotic effect of malabsorbed disaccharide augments intraluminal fluid accumulation in the small intestine, and this may be compounded by hydrolysis in the colon. Carbohydrate malabsorption is an important component of disease in neonatal diarrhea due to rotavirus and coronavirus, and in other conditions in which there is extensive villus atrophy in the small intestine.\n\nProtein digestion in the lumen is reduced if pancreatic protease activity is decreased to --~ 10% of normal, as may occur with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Loss of gastric proteolytic activity is of little nutritional significance. In conditions with villus atrophy, reduced mucosal surface area and poor differentiation of enterocytes result in malabsorption of small peptides and particularly of amino acids by mechanisms similar to those involved in carbohydrate realabsorption. \n\nDiarrhea is the presence of water in feces in relative excess in proportion to fecal dr), matter. Diarrhea usually reflects increased absolute fecal loss of water, but may not, if absolute fecal dry-matter excretion is markedly reduced. Loss of solute and water in diarrhea may lead to severe electrolyte depletion, acid-base imbalance, and dehydration, which are life-threatening if not corrected. Large volumes of fluid derived from ingesta, and from gastric, pancreatic, biliary, and enteric secretion, enter the small bowel; in addition, considerable passive movement of water occurs into the upper small bowel from the circulation in response to osmotic effects. Overall, the bulk of the fluid entering the small intestine is absorbed by the enterocytes, so that the volume leaving the ileum and entering the colon is but a small fraction of the total fluid flux through the small bowel.The large size of this flux implies that relatively small perturbations in unidirectional movement of electrolyte and water may have significant effects on the net movement of fluid.\n\nThe colon, in addition to its fermentative function, has the ultimate responsibility for conserving electrolyte and water by absorption from the digesta, thereby minimizing fecal loss. It has a finite capacity for absorption, and if this is exceeded by the rate at which content enters from the small bowel, diarrhea occurs.This is important in \"small-bowel\" diarrheas, where the lesion is in the small intestine. Since the colon has reserve absorptive capacity, the excess volume entering from the ileum must be considerable for diarrhea to occur.The large capacity and fermentative function of the equine colon may mitigate to some extent the expression of\"small-bowel\" diarrhea in mature animals of that species.\n\n\"Large-bowel\" diarrhea, on the other hand, reflects an intrinsically reduced capacity of the colon to handle even normal volumes of fluid and electrolyte presented to it by the small intestine.\n\nSmall-bowel diarrhea is classed as \"secretory, .... malabsorptive,\" or \"effusive,\" but the mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. Secretory diarrhea is due to an excess of secretion over absorption of fluid, resulting from derangement of normal secretory and absorptive mechanisms. It is best exemplified by the effects of diarrheagenic bacterial enterotoxins. Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli are the most important sources of such toxins, though only the latter occurs in domestic animals; some Salmonella serotypes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella, and Campylobacterjejuni also produce enterotoxin. Cholera, heat-labile E. coli, and C.jejuni enterotoxin act through the mediation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).Toxin-stimulated cAMP shuts down sodium chloride cotransport at the luminal cell membrane of enterocytes, reducing passive water absorption. Meanwhile, cAMP-stimulated chloride secretion is promoted, and water follows. The resultant increase in secretion and decrease in absorption increase the solute and water load passing from the small bowel to the colon. Heat-stable E. coli and Y. enterocolitica enterotoxins stimulate cyclic guanosine monophosphate-mediated secretion by the mucosa.\n\nIn addition to bacterial enterotoxins, other factors may potentially cause secretory diarrhea. Prostaglandins, other eicosanoids, histamine, kinins, and various cytokines directly or indirectly stimulate secretion, often by local stimulation of enteric nervous reflexes, and they may contribute to diarrhea in inflammatory bowel disease. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide secreted by pancreatic islet cell tumors causes severe diarrhea in humans with such tumors, and is probably the final mediator in secretion stimulated by the enteric nervous system.Thyroid C-cell tumors secrete calcitonin; carcinoids secrete serotonin, bradykinin, and substance P; while mast cell tumors secrete histamine, which is also diarrheagenic. Peptide YY has been identified as a powerful inhibitor of intestinal secretion; its presence is mediated by prostaglandin profiles.\n\nMalabsorptive diarrhea is exemplified by the osmotic retention of water in the gut lumen by poorly absorbed magnesium sulfate, used therapeutically as a laxative. Malabsorption commonly results from villus atrophy, no matter what the cause. Electrolyte and nutrient solute, malabsorbed as the result of reduced villus and microvillus surface area, are retained in the lumen of the bowel, along with osmotically associated water. The additional solute and water are passed on to the colon.A secretory component probably contributes to diarrhea due to villus atrophy, at least in transmissible gastroenteritis in pigs. Here, since the villus limb of the postulated cryptvillus fluid circuit is diminished or missing, fluid secreted by the crypts may not be absorbed. Poorly differentiated cells emerging on to the intestinal surface from crypts may also retain some secretory capacity. Malabsorptive diarrhea also occurs in short-bowel syndrome, due to reduced absorptive surface.\n\nIncreased permeability of the mucosa may contribute to diarrhea by permitting increased retrograde movement of solute and fluid from the lateral intercellular space to the lumen, or by facilitating transudation of tissue fluid. Filtration secretion is characterized by increased fluid movement through the epithelial membrane via the paracellular route; the force for secretion is provided by the transepithelial hydrostatic pressure gradient. Elevated capillary hydrostatic pressure, or decreased plasma oncotic pressure in the villus, alters Starling forces, resulting in edema. This overrides the hydrostatic pressure in the interepithelial space, and permits leakage of interstitial fluid and large protein molecules into the lumen through enlarged pores at the tight junctions. Portal hypertension, right-sided heart failure, hypoalbuminemia, and expansion of plasma volume establish such conditions. Effusion may occur in lymphangiectasia, and in inflamed lamina propria, with increased vascular permeability, proprial edema, and enteric plasma protein loss. Increased exfoliation of epithelium and transient microerosions may provide further potential sites for effusion of interstitial fluid.\n\nSevere necrosis of the epithelium and vascular damage in the mucosa cause obvious malabsorption, and effusion of tissue fluid and blood, evident as fibrin and hemorrhage, in the lumen.\n\nLarge-bowel diarrhea is due to a reduction in the innate capability of the colon to absorb the solute and fluid presented by the more proximal bowel. A reduction in net absorption by the colon that is relatively small in absolute terms may be sufficient to cause fluid feces. Colonic diarrhea is characterized by frequent passage of small amounts of fluid feces, perhaps with mucus and blood.\n\nThe colonic mucosa is not as \"leaky\" as the small intestinal mucosa due to the nature of the tight junctions between epithelial cells.As a result, it is relatively resistant to alterations in permeability due to increased hydrostatic pressure in the propria, in comparison with the small intestine.\n\nBile acids mediate diarrhea associated with ileal disease. When normal enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is interrupted by ileal damage or resection, excess bile acids enter the colon where they stimulate chloride ion secretion through a cAMP-dependent mechanism, resulting in diarrhea. Fatty acids enter the colon in increased quantities in steatorrhea resulting from bile salt depletion. Both dihydroxy bile acids and long-chain fatty acids, especially hydroxy fatty acids produced by bacterial action, alter mucosal permeability and cause mild damage to the surface epithelium. The result is net fluid secretion by the colon, and diarrhea. This is also the mode of action of a number of laxatives, including senna and castor oil, which contains the hydroxy fatty acid ricinoleic acid.\n\nAlthough colonic secretion stimulated by bacterial enterotoxin is not clearly implicated in diarrhea, alterations in the flora in the large bowel may be detrimental to normal function.Absorption of volatile fatty acids produced by bacterial fermentation is responsible for considerable concurrent absorption of water in the large intestine. Reduced production or absorption of volatile fatty acids, secondary to imbalance of the bacterial flora in the cecum and colon, may explain some problems of wasting and diarrhea in horses in which no morphologic abnormality of the mucosa can be found.\n\nOsmotic overload of the large bowel results from the delivery by the small bowel of a large volume of fermentable substrate. This may result from excessive intake, but is usually due to malabsorption in the small intestine. Of the malabsorbed nutrients, carbohydrate is the only one of significance in initiating colonk osmotk overload. Bacterial fermentation of carbohydrate results in the production of excess volatile fatty acid.This is readily handled by the colon under normal circumstances, by rapid absorption and by bicarbonate buffering. However, a heavy carbohydrate load may overwhelm the colonic buffering capacity, and cause reduced pH.This results in an altered gut flora dominated by organisms producing lactic acid, which is absorbed at a slower rate than the volatile fatty acids. Further acidification causes mucosal permeability, permitting an influx of water and solute into the lumen from the tissue, as a result of the increased osmotic pressure generated by lactic acid in the lumen. Diarrhea follows.\n\nrole in the pathogenesis of diarrhea. Often the small intestine of animals with diarrhea is flaccid and fluid-filled, rather than hypermotile. Increased colonic motor activity is often segmental and antiperistaltic, and probably unrelated to increased transit. Hypermotility, if it does occur, may be in response to, rather than a cause of, increased volumes of fluid in the gut.\n\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may be a consequence of ileus or hypomotility, partial small-bowel obstruction, and radiation injury. Achlorhydria or hypochlorhydria and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency in the dog may also predispose to this problem. Not associated with any histologic changes other then the presence of bacterial colonies in mucus on the mucosal surface in some cases, SIBO is thought to result in increased intestinal permeability that translates clinically to diarrhea. \n\nDisorders of protein metabolism attributable to enteric disease are responsible for significant economic loss in the form of reduced weight gain, wool growth, and milk production. Severe derangement, resulting in negative nitrogen balance in any species, may lead to cachexia, hypoproteinemia, and death.\n\nDecreased protein intake is the most obvious threat to the nitrogen economy, and it is probably the most important in many chronic gastrointestinal diseases. Subclinical inefficiency in production, reduced growth, and emaciation may be the product of various degrees of inappetence, or difficulty in prehension, mastication, and swallowing, or recurrent regurgitation. Low feed quality compounds the effect of reduced feed intake.\n\nA sharp decline in appetite, or anorexia, is a common sign of indigestion, obstruction, or systemic disease. In ruminants, loss of appetite to various degrees is an especially important component of the pathogenicity of gastrointestinal parasites, including those infecting the abomasum (Ostertagia), small intestine (Trich0str0ngylus), and large bowel (Oesophagostomum). Interactions among cholecystokinin, parasympathetic efferent and afferent reflexes, and systemic or gastric leptins, appear to mediate satiety. How they are disrupted in disease states is unclear.\n\nMalabsorption of peptides and amino acids may occur locally in the small intestine as a result of significant villus atrophy.\n\nHowever, unless the lesion is widespread, or low in the small bowel, net absorption of nitrogen over the length of the small intestine may not be reduced, due to the compensatory capacity of more distal normal mucosa. Overall, the contribution of malabsorption to disordered nitrogen metabolism appears to be minor in most situations.\n\nProtein-losing gastroenteropathy, increased catabolism and loss of endogenous nitrogen via the gastrointestinal tract, is important in many diseases. Excess endogenous protein entering the intestine is derived from two main sources, namely increased turnover of cells lining the gut, and effusion of plasma protein into the lumen of the bowel; the latter is probably the more important.\n\nPlasma protein loss into the gut presupposes abnormal permeability of the mucosa to large molecules. This may be the product of the blood-sucking activity of nematodes such as Haemonchus, Ancylostoma, and Bunostomum, or hemorrhage from sites of trauma in the mucosa caused by the feeding activity of worms such as Oesophagostomum columbianum, Chabertia, and Strongylus. Erosive lesions result in considerable loss of red blood cells and plasma protein. Such lesions may be due to infarction, severe cryptal necrosis, or acute inflammatory damage to the mucosa associated with bacteria, viruses, and coccidia, causing fibrinohemorrhagic enteritis. Microscopic \"leaks\" in the mucosa also permit plasma loss into the gut. These may resuk from increased exfoliation of enterocytes into the lumen in villus atrophy, as transient gaps in the mucosa at the site where the cell sloughs. In villus atrophy with a high rate of enterocyte turnover, temporary microerosions may develop when flattened cells fail to maintain the integrity of the surface epithelium. The permeability of tight junctions between epithelial cells may be sufficiently altered to permit transit of plasma protein molecules, associated with filtration secretion when the hydrostatic pressure in the proprial interstitium is elevated in congestive heart failure and portal hypertension; by decreased plasma oncotic pressure; by increased vascular permeability in acute or chronic inflammation; and in lymphatic obstruction or lymphangiectasia.Tumor necrosis factor-a, prevalent during chronic inflammation, may cause increased paracellular epithelial permeability to large molecules entering the mucosa, and such conditions may permit plasma protein molecules to move in the luminal direction.\n\nPlasma protein loss into the gut is nonselective.Albumin, immunoglobulins, clotting factors, and a variety of transport or carrier proteins, including transferrin, ceruloplasmin, and transcortin, are lost. The physiologic consequences of protein-losing enteropathy may reflect increased catabolism of any of these molecules, but are most obviously related to increased turnover of the albumin pool. Plasma albumin loss into the gut, when expressed as a proportion of the total body pool, will vary in absolute terms, depending on the size of the pool. This concept of fractional catabolic rate is essential to understanding the kinetics of plasma protein turnover.\n\nIn protein-losing enteropathy, albumin turnover may pass through three phases. During the first phase, the fractional catabolic rate increases and, with it, the absolute amount of protein lost into the bowel; as the size of the circulating pool of albumin shrinks, so does the absolute rate of loss of protein, even though the fractional rate remains the same. During the second phase, the size of the circulating pool stabilizes as the rate of albumin synthesis by the liver increases to match in absolute terms the rate of loss. The plasma albumin pool is then in a state of hyperkinetic equilibrium; the pool is smaller, with a higher than normal fractional catabolic rate compensated by an increased rate of hepatic synthesis. Provided that the amount of albumin lost does not exceed the synthetic capacity of the liver, this equilibrium may persist for a considerable period. In the third phase, hypoalbuminemia develops as the fractional catabolic rate exceeds in absolute terms the synthetic capacity of the liver.Alternatively, hypoalbuminemia occurs in the third phase if the rate of synthesis declines, due to deficiency in amino acids derived from the diet and by catabolism of other body protein.\n\nThe hypoalbuminemia in enteric plasma loss is often associated with hyperglobutinemia, since compensatory synthesis ofimmunoglobulin is remarkable. Several times more immunoglobulin than albumin may be lost into the gut as a result. The progress and clinical manifestations of protein-losing enteropathy vary with the rate of onset of plasma loss and the fractional catabolic rate. A sudden onset of severe plasma protein loss may cause death during the first phase, before there is time for compensatory synthesis. If the fractional catabolic rate is gradually and only slightly increased, so that compensation occurs with the albumin pool in equilibrium at only a marginally reduced state (perhaps near or within the normal range), subclinical protein loss occurs. Though the fractional catabolic rate is only slightly elevated, the relatively large size of the albumin pool may mean that the absolute loss of protein exceeds that in a hypoalbuminemic animal with a higher fractional catabolic rate, but a smaller albumin pool.\n\nPlasma protein leaking from the stomach or upper small intestine, and protein derived from exfoliated cells in villus atrophy, may be digested and absorbed in the small intestine. This is dependent on luminal proteolysis by pancreatic enzymes, and compensatory membrane digestion and absorption making up for any malabsorption by proximal atrophic mucosa. But the efficiency of protein digestion, even if it is not reduced, is not total. Therefore, a proportion of the increased endogenous protein entering the lumen will be added to the protein escaping digestion in the small bowel, and will enter the large intestine. Here, most of this protein may be converted to ammonia by the colonic flora and absorbed, so that in animals losing protein high in the gut, there may be little or no increase in fecal nitrogen excretion. On the other hand, much of the protein lost into the colon from lesions at that level is passed in the feces, often as protein, and is lost.Ammonia nitrogen absorbed from the colon is converted in the liver mainly to urea.Animals with increased endogenous protein loss into the stomach or small intestine tend to have slightly raised levels of plasma urea, and an elevated rate of urinary urea excretion.\n\nElevated hepatic synthesis of albumin due to increased turnover of the plasma albumin pool, and increased enteric protein synthesis in support of elevated epithelial turnover in conditions with chronic villus atrophy, is at the expense of anabolic processes elsewhere. Dietary amino acid is diverted to preferential synthesis of plasma and enteric protein. If protein intake is poor due to inappetence or a lowquality ration, or if the rate of protein loss is high, the animal moves into negative nitrogen balance. Catabolism of peripheral protein then assumes an increasingly important role in maintaining the pool of amino acids available for plasma and intestinal protein synthesis. This explains in part the reduced growth rate, decreased muscle mass, and reduced bone matrix in sheep with subclinical or mild parasitism, and the cachexia and osteopenia of severe parasitism.These principles probably hold for all syndromes causing enteric loss of endogenous protein in any species.\n\nLoss of enteric protein, and especially plasma, should be suspected in cachectic or hypoproteinemic animals. Diarrhea is often, but not invariably, present. The two major routes of occult abnormal loss of plasma protein are the kidney in glomerular disease, particularly amyloidosis, and the gastrointestinal tract. Weeping skin lesions are another source. Anemia and hypoproteinemia may be due to hemorrhage externally or into the gastrointestinal tract.Advanced liver disease may cause hypoalbuminemia, in which case other signs of hepatic failure will likely be concurrent (see Vol. 2, Liver and biliary system). Inability or reluctance to eat, inadequate nutrition or starvation also cause emaciation, usually without profound hypoalbuminemia.The cachexia of malignancy must also be differentiated.\n\nProvided it is adequately hydrated, the hypoalbuminemic animal shows evidence of subcutaneous, mesenteric, or gastric submucosal edema, perhaps with hydrothorax or ascites. Wasting of muscle mass may be marked if the protein loss has been severe and chronic. Unlike starvation, protein-losing gastroenteropathy may be associated with the presence of internal fat depots, since assimilation of energy is not necessarily severely impaired, especially in ruminants.\n\nThe development of anemia and the kinetics of the erythron following blood loss into the gastrointestinal tract are similar to those of albumin in plasma loss. Blood loss of any origin, including that clue to hematophagous parasites, may cause anemia. Erythroid hyperplasia in the marrow or in extramedullary sites may not compensate for the continued bleeding. Resolution of the hemorrhage results in eventual restoration of normal red cell numbers and an ultimate decline in erythrocyte production. Chronic blood loss may culminate in depletion of iron stores and development of a nonresponsive hypochromic microcytic anemia. \n\nSegmental anomalies of the intestine are commonly encountered. In early embryonal life the intestine consists of a simple tube, the lumen of which is lined by epithelial cells of endodermal origin. An outer layer of connective tissue from the splanchnic ectoderm surrounds and supports the tube.As the intestines grow with the developing fetus, they form coiled loops that herniate into the umbilicus. In later stages of fetal development, the intestines withdraw, in a cranial to caudal direction, from the umbilicus into the abdomen. The most plausible cause of segmental defects in intestinal continuity is ischemia of a segment of gut during early fetal life, resulting in necrosis of the affected area. In addition, an association has been postulated between pressure on the amniotic vesicle during palpation of the embryo for pregnancy diagnosis prior to 42 days of gestation, and the development of atresia coli in calves. The mechanism of this effect is uncertain. The segmental anomalies of the intestine may vary in degree.\n\nwhen the obstruction is formed by a simple membrane or diaphragm;\n\ncord atresia, in which the blind ends of the gut are joined by a cord of connective tissue; and blind-end atresia, in which a segment of gut and possibly the corresponding mesentery are missing, leaving two blind ends.All types of segmental anomaly can be produced experimentally by ischemia to a portion of the fetal intestine.\n\nAtresia coli is the most common segmental anomaly of the intestine in domestic animals. It is seen particularly in the spiral colon of Holstein calves, and in the large and small colon of foals; it occurs rarely in cats. Atresia coli may be an autosomal recessive trait in Holsteins. A predisposition for male calves has been described, but this is not consistent among studies.Atresia of the small intestine is less common. Atresia ilei is most prevalent in calves, and rare in foals, lambs, piglets, and pups.\n\nThese obstructions prevent the normal movement of gut content and meconium in the fetus and neonate. Therefore, they lead to dilation of the proximal segment, with progressive abdominal distension, which may become so extensive prepartum as to cause dystocia. The bowel beyond the discontinuity is small in diameter, and devoid of content other than mucus and exfoliated cells. Animals fail to pass feces after birth.\n\nAtresia ani (impe~orate anus), overall, is the most common congenital defect of the lower gastrointestinal tract. It may affect all species, but is most often encountered in calves, and in pigs, in which it is considered to be hereditary. The defect may consist only of failure of perforation of the membrane separating the endodermal hindgut from the ectodermal anal membrane, or both anus and rectum may be atretic.Atresia ani may be an isolated abnormality, or it may be associated with other malformations, especially of the distal spinal column (spinal dysraphism, sacral or coccygeal vertebral agenesis), of the genitourinary tract (rectovaginal fistula, renal agenesis, horseshoe kidney, polycystic kidneys, cryptorchidism, duplication of scrotum), and occasionally, with intestinal atresia or agenesis of the colon. Caudal spinal syndromes occur in humans and animals commonly associated with atresia; this association is presumably because of a reduction in the available pool of neuronal cells in the spinal region during intestinal development. Atresia ani may occur with congenital vitamin A deficiency.\n\nShort colon, probably the result of abnormal rotation of the midgut and failure to lengthen during fetal life, has been reported in several cats and dogs. Signs were mild, and possibly unrelated to the colonic lesion. The cecum was on the left side, and ascending, transverse, and descending colon were not demarcated on contrast radiographs. In several cases, anorectal or urogenital abnormalities were concurrent. Anomaly of the colonic mesenteric attachments, presumably congenital, has been associated with the development of colic in a horse, due to distortion and convolution of the large colon.\n\nHypoplasia of the small intestinal mucosa, with short villi and sparse crypts, has been reported in foals with failure of passive transfer of immunoglobulin. This may represent a defect in fetal organogenesis.\n\nCongenital colonic agangliosis, somewhat analogous to Hirschsprung's disease in humans, occurs in white foals that are the offspring of \"frame overo\" spotted parents. It has not been convincingly demonstrated in other species of domestic animals. Clinically, the foals, which are predominantly white with perhaps a few pigmented dots on the muzzle, abdomen, and hindquarters, develop colic, and die generally within 48 hours of birth. There is stenosis mainly of the small colon, but the entire colon and rectum may be involved.The intestine proximal to the stenotic segment is distended with gas and meconium. The descending colon is contracted but patent. Microscopically, ganglia of the myenteric plexus are absent in the walls of the terminal ileum, cecum, and colon, though occasional nerve fibers are evident. Except for the few pigmented spots, melanocytes are absent in the skin. The condition, which appears to be an autosomal recessive trait, is similar to aganglionic colon in Piebald and Spotted Mutant mouse strains. Cutaneous melanoblasts and the myenteric plexus are both derived from the neural crest, which may explain the association between unpigmented skin and lack of the myenteric ganglia.A similar condition of megacolon due to segmental colonic aganglionosis has been reported in pigs. Megacolon associated with few myenteric ganglion cells in Clydesdale foals is not clearly congenital, and is discussed with intestinal obstruction, as is megacolon in other species.\n\nPersistent Meckel's diverticulum is an uncommon anomaly of the lower small bowel, mainly in swine and horses ( Fig. 1.47 ). It is derived from the omphalomesenteric (vitelline) duct, which is the stalk of the yolk sac.Although usually an incidental finding, it may be associated with impaction or intussusception.Also, an increased incidence of tumors has been noted at this site. Persistent vitelline duct cysts, distinct from Meckel's diverticulum, have been described on the ileal serosa and in a mesodiverticular band, as an incidental finding in a dog.\n\nIntestinal diverticula, not always clearly remnants of the vitelline duct, occur rarely in dogs, cats, and horses.They may be incidental, or are associated with obstruction, diverticuloumbilical fistula, or with diverticulitis, perforation, and peritonitis. Intestinal aden\u00b0carcin\u00b0ma' smooth-muscle tumors, and heterotopic gastric fundic and pyloric mucosa may occur in the wall.\n\nClinically, acute obstruction typically involves the upper or middle small intestine; chronic blockage usually involves the ileum and large bowel. Intestinal obstruction may be the sequel to a physical blockage of the lumen resulting from stenosis (narrowing, stricture) due to an intrinsic lesion involving the intestinal wall, obturation (occlusion) by an intraluminal mass, or extrinsic compression.\n\nFailure of the intestinal circular smooth muscle to contract blocks the peristaltic wave, causing functional obstruction, or pseudoobstruction, a clinical syndrome in which there is no physical occlusion of the lumen of an impacted intestine. Adynamie ileus, or intestinal obstruction resulting from inhibition of bowel motility, is a common sequel to peritonitis and pain.\n\nCirculatory embarrassment of a segment of bowel, through embolism or venous infarction, will also cause functional obstruction without a physical blockage. Many of the displacements of gut that produce obstruction, such as volvulus, incarceration, strangulation of a hernia, or intussusception, may cause ischemia.The term\"strangulation obstruction\" is applied to an event that simultaneously causes ischemia and physically blocks the intestine. Mucosal hypoxia may also be a sequel to venous occlusion resulting from distension of gut proximal to a site of obstruction; it may result from local pressure caused by an adjacent mass; or it may be a sequel to circulatory failure. Ischemia in any circumstance is a serious complication, the pathogenesis of which is dealt with later.\n\nProximal to the point of obstruction there is accumulation offluid, derived from ingesta, gastric, biliary, pancreatic, and intrinsic intestinal secretion, and gas, swallowed or originating with bacterial activity in the gut. Intestinal distension results in sequestration of water and electrolytes in the intestinal lumen, edema of the mucosa, further secretion into the gut, perhaps associated with contractile stimuli, and, in extreme cases, transudation from the peritoneal surface.\n\nUpper small-bowel obstruction progresses rapidly to cause vomiting in those species that can vomit, with dehydration, hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis due to loss of acid in vomitus, or sequestration of fluid in the forestomachs.\n\nObstruction of the lower small intestine may result in distension with dehydration. But there is usually less acute electrolyte and acid-base imbalance, since vomition is less severe and absorption of fluid proximal to the obstruction may prevent serious distension and its associated secretion, for some time. Metabolic acidosis eventually ensues following dehydration and catabolism of fat and muscle due to cessation of food consumption and assimilation.\n\nIf ischemia and its complications, including rupture, do not ensue, the animal with acute obstruction succumbs to the systemic effects of hypovolemia, electwlyte, and acid-base disturbance. Lower intestinal or colonic obstruction may result in eventual metabolic acidosis and loss of body condition following a chronic course. In the horse particularly, obstruction or impaction of the cecum or colon may result in local ischemia and rupture.\n\nIn obstruction the outstanding gross alteration in the bowel is distension proximal to the point of blockage, due to ileus and the accumulation of fluid contents and gas.The volume of accumulated content may be remarkable in distal intestinal obstruction, such as rectal stricture in the pig, which causes overt abdominal distension. The location, degree, and duration of the obstruction determine the segment and length of bowel involved and the degree of distension. As distension increases, interference with venous return may develop and the mucosa and submucosa become congested. Devitalization of severely dilated gut, or pressure necrosis of the mucosa at the site of lodgment of intraluminal foreign bodies may occur, leading to gangrene or perforation and peritonitis. Distal to the point of obstruction, the bowel is collapsed and empty.\n\nIntrinsic obstruction due to congenital segmental atresia and imperforations is considered under congenital anomalies of the intestine, above. Acquired stenosis due to pathological processes arising within the wall of the intestine may be partial or complete.The primary lesions include intramural abscesses, intramural hematomas, neoplasms ( Fig. 1.48) , and scarring following ulceration. Many of these develop slowly with a course as described above for simple chronic obstruction.\n\nForeign bodies of all kinds are commonly found. Small rounded foreign bodies and even some sharp-edged objects may pass through the intestines uneventfully, but for these and many large foreign bodies the course is unpredictable. Some may reside in the intestine for long periods and produce no disturbance until they act as a nucleus for the development of an enterolith. Sharppointed foreign bodies may become impacted in the intestine and cause pressure necrosis with ulceration and possibly perforation. Blunt foreign bodies that become impacted cause acute or chronic obstruction depending on their size and location; often they cause local pressure necrosis, and perforation may occur in some cases. Linear foreign bodies, such as strips of cloth or string, which are not infrequently ingested by dogs and cats, may pass through the intestine. However, if they become immobilized they produce a typical lesion. One portion of a string becomes fixed, commonly around the base of the tongue, or by impaction at the pylorus. A free end is then stretched taut distally by peristaltic movements, which pleat the gut on the string ( Fig. 1.49 ). It progressively cuts into the lesser curvature of intestinal loops, causing first a puckering of the mesentery and finally perforation and peritonitis.\n\nEnteroliths (mineral concretions) were common in the colon of horses in the past, and they seem to be re-emerging as a problem in some areas, such as California and Florida. Arabians, Morgans, American Saddlebreds, and donkeys are overrepresented with respect to this problem. The mean age for equine enterolithiasis is about 11 years.The stones are comprised of magnesium ammonium phosphate deposited in concentric lamellae, at the center of which there is a nucleus -a foreign body such as a nail, wire, stone, or particle of feed.\n\nThey vary greatly in size, some weighing as much as 10 kg, and there may be one or more large ones or many small ones.They are usually smooth and often spherical, but contact with other liths, and abrasion, may smoothly flatten some surfaces. Irregular mineralized masses may also occur, usually based on a fibrous nidus, such as twine, rope, or netting.The source of the magnesium phosphate is probably grain, bran, alfalfa, or alkaline water. The mineral salts deposit around a nidus under poorly understood circumstances, but colonic pH above 6.6 seems to contribute to their formation.\n\nFiber balls (phytobezoars or phytotrichobezoars), which consist largely of plant fibers impregnated with some phosphate salt, may especially be found in the colon of horses. They are not as heavy as enteroliths, are moist, and have a velvety surface. They are usually round and smooth, but some are convoluted like the surface of the cerebrum (Fig. 1.50 ). Hairballs (trichobezoars) sometimes occur in dogs and cats and in ruminants; in ruminants they occur in the forestomachs and abomasum.They may obstruct the pylorus, but rarely cause problems in the intestine. Enteroliths and bezoars in horses are usually not significant, and small ones may pass in the feces.Apparently they are moved about enough by peristalsis to avoid pressure necrosis. They may obstruct the gut when they are impacted, usually where the colon narrows, in the pelvic flexure and transverse or small colon.\n\nSmall intestinal obstruction may be caused by parasites that can form rope-like tangled masses in the lumen.This may occur in pigs and foals infested with large numbers of ascarids. It also occurs rarely in sheep heavily infested with tapeworms. Impaction of the ileum is the most common cause of small intestinal, nonstrangulating obstruction in horses. Feeding of a high-fiber diet, such as coastal Bermuda grass hay, predisposes to this condition. Gravel has been reported as a cause of duodenal obstruction in cattle.\n\nImpaction of the colon, by feces in dogs and cats, and by digesta, fibrous foreign material, sand, or feces in horses, is not uncommon and causes simple intestinal obstruction, complicated in the horse by intestinal tympany from fermentative gases if the obstruction is complete. In dogs, obstipation of the colon may be the result of voluntarily suppressed painful defecation, as in prostatic enlargement and inflammation of the anal sacs. Occasionally, it is due to impaction with foreign bodies, especially hair or fine bones in the colon or rectum, or due to stenosis caused by tumors or strictures. It may also complicate trauma to the pelvic area, and paralyzing lesions of the spinal cord; it may occur in Manx cats due to sacral spinal cord anomalies. Megacolon may ensue, if the obstruction persists. In small animals, megacolon is frequently idiopathic. Examination of the syndrome in cats reveals no histologic abnormalities and it is suggested that the underlying problem is disturbance in the activation of smooth-muscle myofilaments. Impaction of the cecum or colon in horses may be precipitated by water deprivation, a change of diet from something soft and lush to hay or chaff, or poor dentition. In animals with dental problems, impaction of the cecum may be recurrent, and cecal smooth muscle may become hypertrophic.Abnormal motility due to altered colonic or cecal pacemaker activity may explain impaction in the absence of other predisposing causes. Deficiency of neurons in the myenteric plexus at the base of the cecum may cause chronic uncoordinated hypercontractility and result in hypertrophy of the circular muscle layer of the cecum. In the colon, fibrous digesta usually impacts at the pelvic flexure, transverse or small colon. Ingestion of indigestible synthetic fibers has been associated with colonic impaction. Sand may sediment in the colon of horses that have grazed on poorly covered sandy soils. Sand may cause chronic colitis with diarrhea and weight loss, or it may accumulate at any level of the large or small colon, causing one or more points of impaction obstruction, often associated with concurrent displacement or torsion. Ingestion of large numbers of acorns and leaves may also cause impaction of the intestinal tract in ruminants. Rupture of the viscus may occur if impactions are not treated, and the bowel wall becomes ischemic and devitalized.\n\nCecal rupture in horses occurs as a complication of impaction, and of parturition in mares. It has also been reported secondary to ulceration as a result of phenylbutazone therapy. Idiopathic cecal rupture, associated with \"overload\" of normal digesta, rather than impaction, is also reported, sometimes as a complication of general anesthesia.Also termed cecal \"dysfunction,\" cecal overload is differentiated from impaction by the more fluid consistency of the contents. The cecum is distended, and the mucosa may be hyperemic and somewhat thickened at surgery. Disordered motility with increased intracecal pressure has been invoked speculatively to explain subsequent cecal rupture. The lacerations of the cecum in this circumstance are reported on the medial aspect at some distance from the base, but this is not consistent.\n\nCompression of intestine causing obstruction is rather common and is caused by tumors, abscesses, peritonitis, and fibrous adhesions.\n\nNeoplasms involve the intestine by extension from adjacent viscera, particularly pancreas.Therefore, many tumors involve the craniodorsal part of the abdominal cavity and impinge on the duodenum.\n\nInflammatory peritoneal adhesions are common, and fibrous bands may stretch from the wall of the bowel to some fixed point, or between two or more points along the bowel or mesentery; the obstruction develops gradually as scarring ties the bowel down or puts kinks in the mesentery. Large firm masses of abdominal fat necrosis cause compression stenosis of small intestine, coiled colon, and particularly descending colon and rectum of cattle. Pedicles of some tumors, especially mesenteric lipomas in older horses, occasionally become wound about loops of intestine and cause obstruction and strangulation. Similarly, the suspensory ligaments of the ovary may entrap the equine colon if the ovary is enlarged by neoplasia or other phenomena. Incarceration in hernias, discussed with other displacements of the bowel, is also a common cause of compression obstruction of the gut.\n\nAdynamic (paralytic) ileus is in itself not of specific interest to the pathologist but is a rather common condition. It frequently follows abdominal surgery in transient episodes, especially when the intestines are handled roughly, or traumatized. It also occurs in peritoneal irritation of any cause, especially in peritonitis. It is the result of neurogenic reflexes that interfere with control of the inhibitory neurons of the myenteric plexus. Continual tonic discharge by these neurons inhibits contraction of circular smooth muscle and prevents peristalsis.\n\nThe intestines are distended with a mixture of gas and fluid, and the wall is flaccid.The defect may be segmental, involving less than a meter of the intestinal length, but there may be many such segments involved, especially in diffuse peritonitis. Gastric rupture may occur in the horse as a complication of obstructive or postoperative ileus of the small intestine.\n\nPseudo-obstruction, a clinical syndrome in which there is no physical occlusion of the lumen of an impacted intestine, may result from segmental or diffuse neuromuscular dysfunction in the gut. It overlaps in part with paralytic ileus, and with elements of impaction and megacolon related to intestinal dysmotility, discussed below. Pseudo-obstruction associated with neuronal hypocellularity or ganglioneuritis involving autonomic ganglia in the gastrointestinal tract, systemic dysautonomia, and intrinsic disease of intestinal smooth muscle are recognized among domestic animals, in addition to congenital aganglionosis of spotted foals, discussed earlier. Occasionally a segment of contracted bowel is noted, causing obstruction; more commonly, in neurogenic disease, affected bowel is dilated, flaccid, and incapable of maintaining tone.\n\nMegacolon in Clydesdale foals, in association with hypoganglionosis of the myenteric plexus, has been reported from the USA and Australia in animals 4-9 months of age. The dorsal colons were markedly dilated and the intestinal wall thin. Small colon was patent but devoid of content. Ganglion cells of the myenteric plexus in the transverse and small colons were reduced or absent. There was variation in ganglion cell density in the dorsal colon; in two cases they were present, while in the third, they were markedly reduced in number. Inflammation was not noted. The time of clinical onset of these cases suggests that they may not have been congenital. The common breed suggests a possible genetic basis for the syndrome. If the lesion is acquired, the factors causing myenteric ganglion cell loss are unknown.\n\nGrass sickness in horses, the prototypic dysautonomia in domestic animals, occurs chiefly in parts of the UK and western Europe, usually in animals at pasture. Although horses of any age may be afflicted, the disease is more common in those 3-6 years of age.Affected animals are dull but show occasional bouts of colicky restlessness. In the acute disease, there is progressively severe tympany, swallowing is avoided, and saliva drools freely. Any attempt to swallow is apparently painful and stimulates reverse peristalsis in the esophagus. Fine muscular tremors develop over the shoulders and there is sweating.The course in acute cases is from 12 to 72 hours. Some survive the acute phase to live much longer, but may die in due course of the disease. With careful nursing, recovery may be complete but take months to years.\n\nAcute lesions at necropsy are confined to the alimentary tract. The esophageal wall is sometimes edematous, and the mucosa may show longitudinal bands of congestion and ulceration, which may extend into the stomach. The stomach is distended with alkaline mucinous fluid, often of khaki color and pea soup consistency, although sometimes more watery with fibrous material. Sometimes the stomach is ruptured.There may also be excess fluid in the small intestine.The large intestine is impacted with dry contents and the fecal pellets in the small colon are small and dry. These masses may have a surface blackened by a small amount of exuded blood. In chronic cases, the volume of alimentary content is reduced to scant amounts in the stomach. There may be hypertrophy of intestinal musculature, often most prominent in the jejunum.\n\nDegenerative lesions, marked by often subtle chromatolysis, nuclear eccentricity, and neuronal necrosis, and the formation of perineuronal eosinophilic axonal spheroids, have been described in many autonomic ganglia, and a central neuropathy has also been described, as has a reduction in the number of interstitial cells of Cajal. Significant inflammation is not evident. Severity of lesions has been shown to correlate with decreased functional cholinergic responses. Clostridium botulinum is thought to play a role in equine dysautonomia, which may hence be a toxicoinfectious form of botulism.\n\nFeline dysautonomia, or Key-Gaskell syndrome, is an autonomic dysfunction of unknown etiology, most common in the UK and continental Europe, with sporadic cases reported elsewhere. A similar syndrome has also been reported in a few dogs.All age groups are affected. Signs include depression, anorexia, reduced lacrimation and salivation, bradycardia, pupillary dilation with delayed pupillary light reflex, megaesophagus, constipation, and, rarely, ileal impaction. Diarrhea is reported in some dogs with dysautonomia.The gastrointestinal signs suggest disordered motility, and animals often succumb to the effects of regurgitation, inanition, or aspiration pneumonia, among other problems. Cases tend to occur in clusters, suggesting an environmental toxin or infectious agent, and exposure to botulinum toxin has been suggested, although no conclusive etiologic associations have been made.\n\nInvolvement of functions controlled by both sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system, and of some functions under voluntary control, is reflected in the distribution of neuronal lesions in ganglia of the autonomic system, and in cranial nerve nuclei III,V, VII, and XII, ventral horns of the spinal gray matter, and in dorsal root ganglia. Chromatolysis-like lesions of affected neurons seen by light microscopy have a distinctiue ultrastructural appearance in dysautonomia. Autophagocytic vacuoles, large cisternae, and complex stacks of smooth endoplasmic membranes are in the cytoplasm of affected cells. Neuronal lesions and subsequent drop-out may be transient, and in the later stages of the disease diagnosis may need to be based on comparative cell counts in ganglia of affected and unaffected cats, unless neuronal loss has been obviously severe.\n\nIntrinsic disease of intestinal smooth muscle may produce a syndrome of intestinal sclerosis, somewhat resembling that in progressive systemic sclerosis or scleroderma of humans. However, in dogs the lesions are restricted to the intestinal tract, where they usually appear to involve the small and large bowel diffusely. There is typically mild to obvious dilation of the bowel. In section, there is a mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate among smooth-muscle fibers in the circular and longitudinal layers of the bowel wall. Associated with this is interstitial fibrosis, and atrophy of smooth-muscle cells. Fibrosis of the small intestine has also been reported in horses, concentrated in the submucosa and accompanied by arteriolosclerosis. A geographic cluster suggests an environmental basis. \n\nEventration is displacement of a portion of the gut, usually the small intestine, outside the abdominal cavity. This is commonly congenital, as in schistosomus reflexus, patent umbilicus, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia.Acquired eventrations result from trauma, and therefore are varied. The displaced intestine herniates into the abdominal muscle or subcutis, or it may be completely exteriorized. Vaginal eventration may occasionally occur in females following trauma.\n\nIn ruminants, cecal dilation and torsion is an uncommon condition. It mainly occurs in animals fed high-concentrate rations, but it has been associated with late gestation, and ileus from other causes. It usually occurs within 2 months postpartum in cattle. It is rare in other ruminants. About 30% of the carbohydrates in the ration are digested in the cecum of ruminants. Sudden change from a roughage to a grain-based ration results in an increase in the concentration of volatile fatty acids, with only a slight decrease in pH of the cecal contents. An increase in the concentration of dissociated volatile fatty acids, especially butyric acid, causes atony of the cecum, and dilation follows. Once the cecum is dilated and distended with watery digesta, various degrees of clockwise or counterclockwise rotation can occur, which may incorporate adjacent terminal ileum or proximal colon.\n\nIn horses, cecal and colonic tympany has a similar pathogenesis. Keadily fermentable carbohydrate, following a sudden change in feed, results in an increase in volatile fatty acid production, which exceeds the buffering and absorptive capacity of the organ. As the pH drops, and fermentation shifts to production of the less well-absorbed butyric and lactic acids, water is drawn into the lumen by the osmotic effect.The large bowel dilates with fluid digesta and gas, and motility is reduced by the effects of the volatile fatty acids. Severe abdominal distension, compression of intra-abdominal organs, reduced cardiac return due to postcaval compression, and reduced respiratory capacity due to compression of the diaphragm may follow, with attendant severe pain. Death due to hypovolemia and acidosis may occur before the large bowel ruptures. In recovered horses, laminitis may occur, due to absorption of endotoxin through the cecal mucosa, which becomes eroded and permeable as a result of local acidosis.\n\nThe large colon of the horse is comprised of a loop of capacious bowel joined along its length by the short mesocolon, and folded upon itself at the sternal, pelvic, and diaphragmatic flexures. The loop is only fixed at its base, by the cecum, the transverse colon, and mesenteric root. Its volume and lack of attachment make the large colon prone to displacement or torsion.\n\nRight dorsal displacement of the colon involves displacement of the left colons to the right of the cecum. Consequently, when the carcass is opened, the left colons are visible first, with the pelvic flexure located near the sternum. It presumably results from displacement and wedging of the large colon due to tympany. The left colon may become displaced clockwise (in the standing animal viewed from above) to the right of the cecum as the pelvic flexure migrates cranial to the cecal root, caudad and to the left across the pelvic inlet, and craniad on the left side, coming to rest at the sternum.This is termed right dorsal displacement with flexion.Alternatively, the left colon may move in the opposite direction, caudal and to the right of the base of the cecum, with the pelvic flexure again lying at the sternum. This is termed right dorsal displacement with medial flexion. Some degree of torsion may also occur, and obstruction, with mild to severe colic, ensues. Surgery is required to correct the displacement.\n\nLeft dorsal displacement of the colon, variously known as entrapment of the colon by the nephrosplenic, renosplenic, or phrenicosplenic ligament, or by the suspensory ligament of the spleen, is also encountered as a cause of obstruction and colic in horses ( Fig. 1.51) . The left dorsal and ventral colon move laterally and dorsally between the spleen and the left body wall, and become trapped, with the spleen to the left and below, the suspensory ligament of the spleen below, the left kidney on the medial aspect, and the abdominal wall dorsally. The sternal and diaphragmatic flexures may be in their normal position, ventral to the stomach, or they may have moved cranially and become displaced dorsal to the stomach. The colon caudal to the entrapment may become curved cranially, with the pelvic flexure rotated through 180 \u00b0, due to tension on the taeniae.The stomach and spleen may be displaced caudally and ventromedially, if the flexures have become displaced dorsally into the space cranial to the stomach, in apposition with the left lobe of the liver. If the colon has moved dorsal to it, the stomach often becomes grossly distended, as a result of compression of the esophagus and the duodenal outflow by the incarcerated colon. Compression of the colon at the point of entrapment can cause local bruising or edema and partial ischemia of the displaced organ, and results in obstruction, which may be incomplete. If the gut remains patent, clinical signs are intermittent. The cecum and small intestine may be distended as a result of the colonic obstruction. The cause of left dorsal displacement is unknown, but may be related to an anatomic predisposition resulting from a large cleft between the spleen and the left kidney.\n\nColonic torsion and volvulus is one of the most common and grave colic conditions in horses. The loop of large colon, with or without the cecum, may rotate around itself at some point along its length, or around the root of the mesentery. The condition is lifethreatening because of severe vascular embarrassment, and is discussed further under Intestinal ischemia and infarction, below.\n\nThis is a displacement of intestine through normal or pathological foramina within the abdominal cavity without the formation of a hernial sac. It is uncommon. Herniation through a natural foramen occurs mainly in horses. In incarceration in the epiploic foramen, a portion of small intestine, usually distal jejunum and ileum, may pass down into the omental bursa and become incarcerated, if the normally short and slit-like epiploic foramen of Winslow is dilated for any reason. In these circumstances, the wall of the omental bursa often ruptures.\n\nOmental hernia occurs when a loop of intestine passes through a tear in the greater or lesser omentum. Mesenteric hernia is due to passage of intestine through a tear in the mesentery. These are probably traumatic defects and usually involve the mesentery of the small intestine, but occasionally, that of the colon.\n\nPelvic hernia occurs in young ruminants, and rarely in other species, following castration. During the operation, excessive traction on the spermatic cord may tear the peritoneal fold of the ductus deferens which fixes the duct to the pelvic wall. A hiatus is formed between the ductus deferens and the lateral abdominal or pelvic walls and, through it, loops of intestine may become incarcerated.\n\nGut may also become incarcerated by passing through lacerations in the lateral ligament of the bladder, or through entrapment by the remnant of a persistent urachus, by the gastrosplenic ligament, and by mesodiverticular or vitelloumbilical bands in the horse.\n\nExternal hernia typically consists of a hernial sac formed as a pouch of parietal peritoneum; a covering of skin and soft tissues; depending on the location of the hernia, a hernial ring; and the hernial contents. The hernial ring is an opening in the abdominal wall, and this may be acquired, or it may be natural as, for example, the vaginal ring at the inguinal canal.The hernia usually contains a portion of omentum, a freely mobile portion of the intestine and occasionally, other viscera.\n\nVentral hernia of the abdominal wall occurs uncommonly in horses, rarely in cattle, and exceptionally in other species, except perhaps following blunt trauma or biting injuries in small animals. These hernias, through the abdominal musculature into the subcutaneous tissue, may be spontaneous in heavily pregnant females, especially older animals, or be a consequence of blunt trauma, bite wounds, horn injuries, surgical scars, or inflammations, which cause weakening or perforation of the muscle. In pregnant mares, they often occur in the lower flank lateral to the mammae, where there is only a single layer of muscle, the transverse abdominal. They may become very large in herbivores because of the weight of the alimentary viscera and pregnant uterus. The lesion must be differentiated from rupture of the prepubic tendon, and from postmortem rupture of abdominal muscle in bloated animals.\n\nUmbilical hernia is common and is often present as a congenital and perhaps inherited defect. It is most frequent in pigs, foals, calves, and pups and depends on persistent patency of the umbilical ring. It is the most common congenital defect in cattle and has a hereditary component in the Holstein breed. It is also significantly predisposed by umbilical infection. The hernial sac is formed by peritoneum and skin; the contents depend on the size of the ring and of the sac.\n\nIncarceration of enclosed intestine is uncommon. Formation of an enterocutaneousfistula, a rare complication of umbilical hernia, is seen most frequently in the horse.\n\nInguinal hernia may evolve to scrotal hernia when the herniated viscera pass down the inguinal canal. The internal, or deep, inguinal ring remains patent in intact male animals, but its diameter and the tendency to herniation in the neonate may be inherited. Inguinal hernias are classified as direct or indirect.\n\nIn direct inguinal hernia, which is less common, abdominal contents pass through the internal inguinal ring and come to rest in a subcutaneous position, through a tear in either the peritoneum or the fascia around the deep inguinal ring. This is most commonly seen in foals and is thought to result from increased intra-abdominal pressure during passage through the birth canal.These direct inguinal hernias often cause necrosis of overlying skin, can become fixed by adhesions, and strangulate. They are life-threatening.\n\nIndirect inguinal hernias, by contrast, consist of abdominal contents contained witkin the tunica vaginalis.These are by far the most common form, occurring as a congenital problem in the young of many species, and as an acquired problem in older animals. While size of the inguinal rings may be a factor in neonates, there is usually no apparent cause in acquired cases. The herniated viscus passes through the inguinal and vaginal rings within the vaginal sheath, coming to lie in the scrotum inside the cavity of the tunica vaginalis. If the hernia is scrotal, there may be degeneration of the testicles. Routine castration of such animals can lead to eventration through the scrotal incision, and closed castration may cause infarction of the herniated loop of gut.\n\nCongenital inguinal hernia is rare in dogs;West HighlandWhites, Pekingese, and Basenjis may be predisposed, and it is more common in males than females. However, overall, inguinal hernia is much more common in female dogs. The bitch differs from females of other species in having a patent inguinal ring and canal, through which the omentum and the uterus may pass. The herniated uterus may become incarcerated when pregnant, or if pyometra develops. In horses, indirect inguinal hernias may rupture through the inguinal canal, coming to rest in a subcutaneous location. These ruptured indirect hernias have a similar prognosis as the direct inguinal hernias described above.\n\nFemoral hernias develop as an outpouching of peritoneum through the femoral triangle along the course of the femoral artery. They contain omentum and small intestine.\n\nwith prostatic enlargement and obstipation. They are precipitated by abdominal straining and are probably predisposed to by weakening of perineal fascia and muscles from some unknown cause, possibly hormonal. They are very unusual in females. R.etroperitoneal pelvic fat bulges through a defect between the coccygeus medialis muscle and the cranial border of the anal sphincter. Usually this is the only tissue to prolapse, and the lesion consists, essentially, of a loss of support on one side of the anal ring. Concomitant with the loss of pelvic support the rectum deviates, and the prostate and the bladder may move into the pelvis. Further displacement may occur occasionally and then the latter organs are forced through the ruptured perineal fascia, causing acute urethral obstruction. Perineal hernias are most commonly unilateral, but bilateral hernias may occur.\n\nDiaphragmatic hernias are common. The defect in the diaphragm may be congenital, but most often it is acquired, generally as the result of increased abdominal pressure.Though abdominal viscera pass into the thoracic cavity, strangulation of displaced gut is rare. Acquired diaphragmatic hernias are considered more fully in the section Abnormal contents in the peritoneal cavity.\n\nThe sequelae of hernias depend largely on their location and content, but some generalities apply to all. As long as the hernial contents remain freely movable and reducible, there may be no untoward sequelae. Fixation of the hernial contents (incarceration) is a serious development. Incarceration may result from stenosis or tension of the hernial ring, adhesion between the contents and the sac, or distension of the herniated viscus. This distension may be due mainly to mural congestion and edema in any incarcerated viscus, accumulated gas or ingesta in the intestine, urine in a herniated bladder, and fetuses or pus in a herniated uterus. Incarcerated intestine may become obstructed, or undergo ischemic necrosis and perforate, causing peritonitis. Small intestine fixed by incarceration may be predisposed to volvulus. \n\nInadequate or interrupted circulation of blood to the gut is a common problem, particularly in the horse. Obstruction of the efferent veins, blockage of afferent arteries, and reduced flow through an open circulation cause hypoxic damage to the intestine.Whatever the initiating cause, the effect of hypoxia at the level of the mucosa is similar.\n\nIn the small intestine, within 5-10 minutes of the onset of ischemia, changes are observed at the tips of villi in tissue sections examined under the light microscope, and lesions are well advanced by 30 minutes. Separation of the epithelium from the basement membrane, beginning at the tip of the villus, and progressing with time toward the base, causes the formation of the so-called Gruenhagen's space. Epithelial cells appear relatively normal, but may separate from the villus in sheets. The core of the villus contracts toward the base.Within 1-3 hours, the villus is completely denuded of epithelium, and the mesenchymal core is disintegrating or collapsed and stumpy, with hemorrhage from capillaries.\n\nThat this lesion is largely a function of hypoxia is indicated by the mitigating effects of intraluminal oxygen perfusion. The putative countercurrent exchange of oxygen between the afferent arteriole and efferent venules in the villus, and an associated progressive decline in oxygen tension distally in the villus, may render the tip prone to early damage in hypoxia.Villus smooth-muscle contraction, exacerbating the epithelial exfoliation on the distal villus, may be mediated by sympathetic stimulation in ischemia.\n\nDissociation and necrosis of cells in the crypts of Lieberkiihn begin about 2-4 hours after the initiation ofischemia, and within 4-5 hours the epithelium appears completely necrotic or has sloughed, leaving a mesenchymal ghost of the mucosa. The muscularis mucosae may undergo necrosis, but the muscularis externa remains viable for 6-7 hours. During acute ischemia, there is initial hyperexcitability of muscle in affected areas, followed by progressive loss of contractility, which will fail to recover if ischemia persists beyond 4-6 hours. Mesothelial cells on the serosa undergo necrosis within 30-60 minutes of ischemia, and exfoliate; there is a local acute inflammatory response, which may predispose to the development of adhesions.\n\nThe colon of the dog and horse seems less sensitive to short-term ischemia than the small intestine. Mild morphologic damage, characterized by mild edema, and separation and exfoliation of surface epithelium between crypts, is found after 1 hour. However, by 3-4 hours, crypt epithelium is becoming necrotic, dissociating, and exfoliating, and from that point events progress as in the small intestine.\n\nReperfusion injury, superimposed on the effects of ischemia alone, may enhance the severity of the lesion, if hypoxia is only partial, or ischemia is transient, and reflow of blood raises the tissue oxygen tension. Reperfusion injury implies that the effects of the hypoxic episode have not progressed to complete necrosis of the mucosa, and that further damage is possible. Hence, there is a relatively short duration of hypoxia, and a concomitant mild-to-intermediate degree of mucosal damage, permissive of this phenomenon. In cases of enteric ischemic disease encountered in veterinary medicine, this threshold may frequently have been crossed by the time that the animal is presented for therapy. In addition, there is evidence that in swine, and in the horse, where intestinal ischemic events are most common, reperfusion injury is less likely to occur than in other species.\n\n1Keperfusion injury is the result of an interplay among freeradical-mediated damage to the microvasculature and probably stromal elements and epithelium; neutrophil margination and diapedesis into tissue; complement activation; and release of proinflammatory proteins and cytokines, some of which may have systemic effects.\n\nFree radicals in reperfusion injury are largely generated through xanthine oxidase mechanisms in the intestinal mucosa, and through NADPH oxidase mechanisms in leukocytes, mainly neutrophils, already resident in or recruited to the damaged tissue. Hypoxia stimulates the conversion ofxanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase in epithelial cells. In the presence of xanthine oxidase, hypoxanthine accumulating from adenosine triphosphate degradation in hypoxia is converted to xanthine, and molecular oxygen is reduced, generating hydrogen peroxide, superoxide radical and hydroxyl radical intermediates, which inhibit the accumulation of protective nitric oxide.The hydroxyl radical is likely most significant in damaging proteins and initiating a cascade of lipid peroxidation, resulting in metabolic and structural lesions and culminating in cell death.\n\nThe acute inflammatory response that accompanies reperfusion results in production of free radicals by the respiratory burst from neutrophils, release of proteolytic enzymes, and physical impairment of the microcirculation. Reduction in tissue nitric oxide permits dismutation of oxygen free radicals to H202, which promotes activation of phospholipase, leading to the accumulation of proinflammatory mediators, and production of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-o [ and -[3, interleukins) and adhesion molecules by endothelium. Complement activation is mediated by adhesion molecules, promoting inflammatory events and release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-or and interleukin-1, as well as other cytokines, which increase during reperfusion.\n\nSequelae of ischemia vary with duration, and hence severity, of insult. Short-term ischemia (maximally, \"--3-4 hours), with preservation of at least the base of the crypts of Lieberkfihn, will permit repair, as cells proliferating in the crypts re-epithelialize the mucosat surface within 1-3 days. Normal architecture is re-established after up to 1-2 weeks, though necrotic muscularis mucosae is not replaced. Effusion of tissue fluid and acute inflammatory cells prevails until epithelium extends to cover the eroded surface fully. Partial damage to the proliferative compartment initially results in dilation of crypts, lined by flattened epithelium resembling that seen after radiation injury ( Fig. 1.52 ). If the amplifier population of progenitor cells can be regenerated, hyperplastic basophilic cells will populate crypts until the mucosal architecture is reconstituted.\n\nIschemic necrosis of the full thickness of the mucosa will be bounded by an acute inflammatory reaction in the submucosa, which, under favorable conditions, evolves into a granulating ulcerated surface. Focal ulcerative lesions may ultimately heal by epithelial migration, over the bed of granulation tissue, from surviving crypts within the lesion and around the periphery.\n\nExtensive mucosal ulcers that form following severe ischemia have little chance of resolution, due to their large surface area. Chronic ischemic ulcers in the small bowel tend to develop a depressed, fairly clean granulating surface, occasionally with some fibrinous exudate.\n\nIschemic ulcers in the large bowel, especially of horses, develop a dirty yellow-gray fibrinonecrotic surface, perhaps due to the effects of anaerobic bacteria. If the animal does not succumb to the effects of malabsorption and protein loss from the defect, or to transmural bacterial invasion, scarring and stricture may occur.The sequelae of ischemia with reflow are mainly seen in strangulated segments of gut that have been reduced without, or with inadequate, resection, and in some cases of presumed thromboembolic infarction of the equine colon.\n\nPersistent ischemia results in necrosis involving all mural elements. The full thickness of the gut wall ultimately becomes gangrenous, green-brown or black, flaccid and friable.\n\nThe consequences of ischemic lesions are partly a function of the species, and of the level of bowel affected. Strangulation, volvulus, and similar lesions cause physical obstruction at the site, and ileus proximal to it. Reduced arterial perfusion or thromboembolism causes functional obstruction and ileus. Loss of mucosal integrity results in cessation of electrolyte and water absorption, and ultimately in effusion of tissue fluid and blood into the lumen. Proliferation of anaerobes occurs in the lumen of the stagnant ischemic area, with accumulation of gas, and extreme distension of the closed loop in strangulation obstruction. Toxin production by anaerobes, particularly clostridia, plays a large part in gangrene and ultimate rupture of ischemic gut, as well as having systemic effects.Absorption of endotoxin from the lumen may occur through devitalized mucosa via the portal flow, lymphatic return, or peritoneum. Toxins have a severe detrimental effect on cardiovascular function, contributing to circulatory failure. If death from some other cause does not supervene, transmural invasion by enteric bacteria or perforation of the devitalized wall results in septic peritonitis that is ultimately fatal.\n\nObstruction of efferent veins is by far the most common cause of intestinal ischemia.This is a sequel to incarceration of herniated loops of bowel; strangulation by pedunculated masses, such as lipomas in older horses; torsion (twist about the long axis of the viscus);volvulus (twist across the long axis of the gut); and intussusception. In these circumstances compression of thin-walled veins tends to occur before the influx of arterial blood is obstructed.\n\nIn venous infarction, the affected tissue field, often including involved mesentery, becomes intensely edematous, congested, and hemorrhagic, so that the hypoxic bowel wall is thickened and eventually assumes a deep red-black appearance ( Fig. 1.53 ). It has been estimated that 40 liters of fluid may accumulate in the wall of a horse colon that has undergone volvulus. Bloody fluid content and gas distend the lumen of the infarcted segment.As gangrene of the intestinal wall proceeds, the tissue becomes green-black, and septic peritonitis eventually ensues, with or without perforation of the bowel.Advanced venous infarction involves the full thickness of the intestinal wall, and the initiating intestinal accident is commonly evident, except in cases subjected to surgery. Even if a displacement, volvulus, or strangulation has been reduced, the limits of the infarcted segment are usually relatively sharply demarcated, and the affected bowel remains edematous and hemorrhagic. Microscopically, severe transmural edema, congestion, distension of veins, sometimes venous thrombosis, and hemorrhage are present, initially most severe in the mucosa and submucosa. With time, the full thickness of the mucosa becomes necrotic, and the deeper layers of the muscular wall are also devitalized, with invading enteric flora present throughout. Lesions which have advanced to significant necrosis or effacement of the crypt epithelium are associated with failure of the animal to survive, due to either euthanasia on the grounds of the degree of damage, or systemic complications despite correction of the strangulation, or resection.\n\nDisplacements of intestine that may progress to incarceration or volvulus with strangulation and infarction have been discussed in the previous section.They are a common cause of colic and mortality in horses.\n\nTorsion of the long axis of the mesentery occurs commonly in suckling ruminants and in swine, uncommonly in horses, and rarely in cats and dogs. The abdomen is distended and, upon opening the cavity, tensely dilated deep red-to-black loops of bowel are usually immediately apparent.\n\nIn swine, the mesentery of the small intestine and sometimes the large bowel is often involved in a torsion that is usually counterclockwise, when viewed from the ventrocaudal aspect. In torsion involving the small and large intestines, the apex of the cecum may be pointing cranial in the cranial left qua&ant of the abdomen, reflecting the rotation of about 180 \u00b0. In swine, mesenteric torsion may be due to gas production from a highly fermentable substrate in the colon, and its subsequent displacement, with progression to mesenteric torsion. Mesenteric torsion is a common cause of sporadic sudden death in swine but may occur as a recurrent problem in a herd. Many cases of so-called \"intestinal hemorrhage syndrome\" in that species are probably misdiagnosed mesenteric torsion.\n\nDeath due to mesenteric torsion is common in suckling or artificially reared calves and lambs. In these species, vigorous ingestion of large amounts of feed over a short period may predispose to gas formation in the gut, or perhaps hypermotility, which induces torsion. Usually only the mucosa of the proximal duodenum and terminal ileum, cecum, and colon is spared from infarction, though occasionally volvulus is restricted to shorter segments of intestine. Similar lesions are occasionally encountered in other species.\n\nIn dogs, mesenteric torsion has been associated with ingestion of large quantities of food, and with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in German Shepherds. It is occasionally accompanied by gastric volvulus.\n\nVolvulus of various lengths of the small intestine may occur in any species, but is perhaps most prevalent in the horse, where it is a common cause of strangulation obstruction of the bowel.\n\nVolvulus of the large colon of the horse is predisposed by its lack of mesenteric anchorage, and potential mobility. It may be due to dorsomedial (ventral colon rotating dorsally and medially relative to the dorsal colon) or dorsolateral rotation of the colonic loop along its long axis. Rotation of the left colon commonly progresses to volvulus at the sternal and diaphragmatic flexures.The right colon may rotate in its middle, cranial to the level of the cecocolic fold. Part of the cecum may be incorporated in the volvulus, the right colon and cecum rotating in the region of attachment of the cecocolic fold. Or almost the entire large colon and cecum may be involved in a rotation at the cecal base and transverse colon.The equine cecum alone rarely undergoes torsion, and if so, it may be related to hypoplasia of the cecocolic fold.\n\nThe most common direction of rotation of the right colon is dorsomedial. The direction and sites of rotation suggest that lesions may begin with tympany and dorsomedial torsion in the left colon, with progression of the twist, from left to right colon. The sternal and diaphragmatic flexures presumably provide some resistance to rotation, causing some twists to be found there.The first site of fixation of the large colon is the cecocolic fold, which may explain a tendency for twists to be localized there; progression beyond this level bases the twist at the mesenteric root of the large bowel. Clinical signs are associated with rotations of over 180 \u00b0, and torsions involving the cecal base are usually at least 360 \u00b0 .\n\nAt surgery or necropsy, the usual signs of strangulation obstruction are evident, including dilation and devitalization of the infarcted segment, and distension of the cecum if it is not twisted. Postmortem rupture of the diaphragm or abdominal wall may occur, due to tympany.\n\nIntussusception involves the telescoping of one segment of bowel into an outer sheath formed by another, usually distal, segment of gut ( Fig. 1.54 ). Any level of the gut with sufficient mesenteric mobility may be involved. The cause is usually not apparent, though linear foreign bodies, heavy parasitism, previous intestinal surgery, enteritis, and intramural lesions such as abscesses and tumors may be associated. It may also be a terminal, agonal, or postmortem event. The history is that of partial or complete intestinal obstruction, perhaps with bloody feces, and it is most common in young animals.\n\nIntussusception is common in dogs, where most frequently it is ileocolic. It is much less common in cats. Intussusception is also with edema and congestion, and the adjacent apposed serous surfaces become adherent as fibrin and inflammatory cells effuse from the affected bowel. Adhesion quickly renders the intussusception irreducible. Necrosis and gangrene of the invaginated intestine usually develop, but sometimes the intussusceptum will slough, and the remaining viable segments will maintain continuity of the gut, or rarely, will form two adjacent blind ends. Intestine above obstructing intussusceptions may be dilated, and that below contracted and devoid of content. If obstruction is chronic or partial, there may be hypertrophy of the smooth muscle of proximal bowel. In horses, chronic ileocecal intussusception involves a relatively short (< 10 cm) length of bowel. Incidental terminal, agonal, or postmortem intussusception is recognized by the relative absence of congestion, edema, and adhesion of the involuted segment of gut. Cecal inversion, and cecocolic intussusception in the horse, with inversion of the cecum into itself, or into the right ventral colon, may result in ischemia of the cecum and possibly part of the involved colon; if partial, ischemia usually involves the more distal cecum.\n\nSegmental ischemic necrosis of the small colon may occur in pregnant or postpartum mares, due to mesenteric tension from intussusception and rectal prolapse of the distal large bowel, or perhaps due to laceration of the mesocolon and associated vessels by the feet of the foal during parturition. Colic, and intestinal obstruction, necrosis, rupture, and peritonitis may follow.\n\nIschemia of the gut due to arterial thrombosis and embolism is rare in domestic animals other than the horse. Mucosal and occasionally transmural focal or segmental infarctive lesions are seen in Pasteurella septicemia in lambs and in Histophilus somni bacteremia in cattle.\n\nMost cases of embolic disease are associated with bacterial infections that cause softening and lysis of thrombi and facilitate formation of emboli. This is particularly true for the lesions associated with strongyle migrations in horses, where lesions remain localized unless thrombi induced by the parasite become secondarily infected.\n\nIn horses it is associated with endoarteritis, mainly at the root of the cranial mesenteric circulation, caused by migrating larvae of Stwngylus vulgaris (seeVol. 3, Cardiovascular system). Effective worm control programs have rendered this problem increasingly rare.\n\nCandidates for a diagnosis of nonstrangulating infarction are animals in which the anatomic distribution of an ischemic lesion is incompatible with volvulus or other strangulation, or where physical evidence for incarceration or strangulation obstruction is not present in the surgical history or at autopsy, and where there is evidence of verminous arteritis. Typically, ischemic lesions of this type are limited to the \"watersheds\" at the periphery of the colic and cecal arterial circulatory fields-the pelvic flexure and the distal cecum-since collateral circulation within these circulatory fields is extensive.\n\nLesions limited essentially to the mucosa usually appear to be subacute, the result of ischemia of relatively short duration, and are ulcerative or fibrinonecrotic, usually with a hyperemic margin.They may be tens to many hundreds of square centimeters in area.\n\nTransmural lesions represent ischemia of longer duration. Devitalized gray-brown intestine of normal thickness is interpreted to represent arterial obstruction without significant reflow, except along the boundary with viable tissue. Large edematous, congested, or hemorrhagic, full-thickness lesions, physically or anatomically inconsistent with strangulation, are interpreted as severe arterial obstruction, with subsequent reflow either by relief of the obstruction or by way of collaterals. Ischemic damage to vessels of the mucosa, submucosa, and perhaps deeper structures results in hemorrhage and edema when blood flow returns (Fig. 1.55) . Ulcerative or fibrinonecrotic mucosal lesions are probably the result of transient ischemia, and superficial or mucosal damage, with subsequent reflow. Similar lesions may occur following relief of strangulation of short duration, and in nonsteroidal le col.ic artery contains a thrombus (arrow). Hemorrhage and edema of the serosa usion, with extravasation of blood from damaged vessels in the affectedtissue. B, uced arteria[ perfusion. Subsequent reflow has occurred and the infarcted mucosa are present on the mucosa along the proximal margin of the lesion (toward top).\n\nanfi-infammatory drug toxicosis or salmonellosis, both of which, in part, involve mucosal microthrombosis.\n\nIschemia due to reduced perfusion of the intestinal vascular bed is a difficult and uncommon diagnosis. Circumstances where it may be expected to occur include severe hypovolemic states, such as hemorrhagic shock in the dog, cat, and possibly other species; in animals, particularly dogs, with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); in dogs with hepatic disease and portal hypertension; in hypotensive shock due to heart failure; and in animals with reduced mesenteric arterial perfusion, mainly horses with severe verminous endoarteritis.\n\nIn \"shock gut\" in dogs, and rarely, other species, associated terminally with heart failure, hemorrhage, hypovolemia, and DIC, part or all of the mucosa of the small intestine is deeply congested and the content is hemorrhagic. The pathogenesis of the lesion is related to reflex vasoconstriction in the mucosa and submucosa, shunting of blood away from the mucosa, dilation of mucosal capillaries, and reduction in rate of flow of blood through the villus. Countercurrent transfer of oxygen from the afferent to efferent vessels in the villus aggravates hypoxemia in the villus by increased shunting of oxygen to the efferent venule. Splanchnic pooling of blood, systemic arterial hypotension, and intestinal vasoconstriction occur in endotoxic shock in dogs, causing similar mucosal lesions. Microthrombosis associated with sluggish flow, DIC, and endotoxemia may contribute to mucosal ischemia by obstructing capillaries in the villi, and mucosal and submucosal venules. Microthrombi in these vessels in association with hemorrhagic mucosal necrosis suggest the possibility of ischemia due to \"slow flow.\" Transient or incomplete reduction in perfusion due to obstruction of the arterial blood supply has a similar effect on the mucosa. The obstruction may be due to arteriospasm, perhaps induced by vasoactive mediators such as thromboxane. Mucosa devitalized by hypoxia will become hemorrhagic with continued blood flow. Since the primary problem may not involve a systemic state as complicated as severe shock, the animal may survive long enough to develop an effusive ulcerated or pseudomembranous mucosa, with some prospect of stabilization or repair, if the lesion is not widespread. \"Slow flow\" due to reduced arterial perfusion with inadequate collateral flow may be expected to affect the \"watershed\" of a circulatory field preferentially. In the horse this may be the explanation for mucosal lesions at the pelvic flexure and apex of the cecum in which thromboembolism cannot be implicated, but in which mural thrombi in the cranial mesenteric root could have caused significantly reduced perfusion or flushed vasoconstrictive thromboxane into circulation. Transient or noninfarctive \"slow flow\" has been proposed as a cause of intermittent colic due to verminous arteritis. It may also play a role in the development of functional obstruction and volvulus in horses with cranial mesenteric arterial lesions.\n\nIschemia at the periphery of the circulatory field of the caudal mesenteric artery may possibly predispose to rectal perforation in horses. The precarious peffusion of the mucosa at this site may contribute to ischemic ulceration and the development of rectal stricture in swine. In many cases this condition appears to be associated with Salmonella infection, and it is discussed further with porcine salmonellosis (p. 198).\n\nAcute acorn poisoning in the horse may cause severe gastrointestinal edema and focal hemorrhage, with infarction and ulceration in the cecum and colon. Microscopic lesions in the small and large intestine are consistent with an ischemic pathogenesis, and microthrombi have been associated with mucosal infarcts in the large bowel, as well as in other organs.\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs cause ulceration of the upper small intestine and colon, as well as oral and gastric ulceration, which seem to be related to ischemia, in horses and dogs. In horses, phenylbutazone, even at therapeutic dosages, can result in ischemic damage to the intestinal mucosa. It may be that intercurrent stress or dehydration contributes to the pathogenesis. The right dorsal colon is affected preferentially, resulting in the term \"right dorsal colitis.\" Lesions here are characterized by ischemia, often with marked edema and avascular necrosis. Lesions may be focal, linear, or extensive and segmental, involving the entire circumference of the bowel (Fig. 1.56) . Depending on the duration and severity of the lesion, the mucosa may be congested and edematous, with superficial necrosis and fibrin exudation, or extensively eroded and ulcerated, with fibrinonecrotic exudate. Early in the process, superficial epithelial necrosis and progressive mucosal necrosis and inflammation are evident. Microvascular injury, with subsequent microthrombosis and ischemic ulceration, is considered by some to be the cause of the lesions in the stomach and intestine.This may be the result of direct phenylbutazone toxicity to the microvasculature. Vasoconstriction or depression of other cytoprotective effects, mediated by phenylbutazone inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, could be the cause of the lesions. Animals may develop diarrhea and hypoproteinemia as a result of the extensive mucosal defects. Minor mucosal lesions may resolve; a sequel to severe colonic damage in horses is colonic stricture.\n\nLesions in the oral cavity associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug administration are deep crateriform ulcers, with a clean granulating base. Concurrent with punched-out ulcers in the glandular mucosa, there may be chronic gastritis and atrophy of the mucosa with loss of differentiation of the cells in the fundus.\n\nIn the upper small intestine, ulcers may be focal, linear, or segmental and annular. Microscopic lesions that may precede ulceration of the small intestine include mild to severe atrophy of villi, epithelial necrosis, mucosal inflammation, and fibrin exudation. Renal papillary necrosis is often concurrent, if animals are dehydrated. \n\nIntestinal lipofuscinosis (\"brown gut\") in dogs is characterized grossly by tan-brown discoloration of the intestinal muscularis ( Fig. 1.57) .\n\nIt may involve all areas of the gut, but is most common in the lower small intestine. The bladder and mesenteric and peripheral lymph nodes may also be affected grossly. Although the lesion may be incidental, it is usually associated with ckronic enteric and~or pancreatic disease. Lipofuscinosis has been reported in Boxer dogs with histiocytic ulcerative colitis, but a definite correlation between the two conditions has not been established. A high prevalence of lipofuscinosis has also been reported in dogs that were fed rations high in polyunsaturated fats with a relative de.fidency of vitamin E, and it is prevented by vitamin E supplementation. Any condition, such as exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, causing a reduction in the absorption of fats, and consequently of the fat-soluble vitamins, especially in the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the diet, may predispose to lipofuscinosis. The microscopic lesions of brown gut are gray-to-brown granules in the perinuclear regions of smooth-muscle cells in both inner and outer muscle layers ( Fig. 1.58 ).The granules stain as lipofuscin (periodic acid-Schiff-positive, sudanophilic, weakly acid-fast with Ziehl-Neelsen), and fluoresce dim yellow in paraffin section.\n\nThe granules, termed leiomyometaplasts, are oxidized polymerized phospholipids which are highly resistant to further endophagocytic degradation.They are derived from excess cell membrane lipid peroxidation in vitamin E deficiency. Their propensity to accumulate, especially in gastrointestinal smooth muscle, is unexplained.\n\nA distinct syndrome occurs in Cocker Spaniel dogs affected with generalized ceroid-lipofuscinosis, an inherited storage disease. In affected dogs, discoloration of intestinal smooth muscle is evident but, in addition, they have progressive hindlimb paresis and incoordination.\n\nMuscular hypertrophy of the intestine was formerly a common finding in swine, but it appears to have diminished in prevalence in most areas. It may be found in apparently healthy animals at slaughter as a uniform thickening of the muscular coats of the terminal ileum. The segment involved always includes the most caudal portion, but it may extend a variable distance forward, usually 25-50 cm. The affected area is thickened and has the turgid feel of a rubber hose. The lumen is small and the mucosa is thrown into thick folds, but it is the muscle that thickens the wall. This condition must be differentiated from adenomatosis and necrotic ileitis, manifestations of enteropathy associated with Lawsonia in swine.\n\nRupture may occur, in association with impaction of dehydrated feed in the hypertrophic segment. The actual rupture may be a result of violent peristalsis, or diverticula may develop ( Fig. 1.59) , the mucosa undergoing necrosis with secondary bacterial inflammation. Perforation occurs at these weakened areas.While the underlying basis of this condition is obscure, it is likely that the muscular hypertrophy is secondary to a functional obstruction of the ileocecal orifice. Muscular hypertrophy of the small intestine, of uncertain cause, but sometimes associated with Anoplocephala sp. tapeworms at the ileocecal orifice, also occurs in horses (Fig. 1.60 ). The association with tapeworm infection is uncertain because a considerable proportion of cases also show muscular hypertrophy of the terminal esophagus. The lesions are similar to those described in swine, except that the affected segment may occur at any point along the small intestine, and occasionally in the large intestine, although the ileum is the most common site. Horses with this condition may have chronic mild colic and anorexia or intermittent diarrhea with progressive loss of weight. Diverticula, and perforation or laceration of the thickened intestinal wall, may also occur.\n\nIntestinal smooth-muscle hyperplasia has been described in a goat. Unlike the condition in horses and swine, the increased muscular thickness was jejunal rather than ileal.\n\nDiverticulosis of the small intestine is a rare lesion that is sometimes associated with muscular hypertrophy in pigs and horses. It is characterized by the presence of saccular dilations, which are lined by intestinal mucosa, in the muscularis and subserosa of the small intestine.The diverticula tend to follow the pathway of blood Intestinal emphysema is a rare condition found mainly in weaned pigs, in which it is usually an incidental finding in slaughtered animals, with no economic significance. It is characterized by numerous thin-walled, gas-fdled cystic structures, a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter, in the gut wall and on the serosal surface ( Fig. 1.61) .These are mainly located in the small intestine, although the large intestine, mesentery, and mesenteric lymph nodes may be involved. Microscopically, the cystic structures appear to be dilated lymphatics that are located in the lamina propria, submucosa, muscularis, subserosa, mesentery, and mesenteric lymph nodes. A pleocellular inflammatory reaction may be evident in the walls of the cysts.Although production of gas by bacteria has been implicated, the cause remains obscure.\n\nRectal prolapse most commonly occurs in swine, sheep, and cattle. It may occur in any animal that has prolonged episodes of tenesmus or straining, usually associated with colitis or urinary infection or obstruction. In pigs, rectal prolapse occurs as a herd problem when the ration contains zearalenone, an estrogenic mycotoxin produced by fungi of the genus Fusarium. The toxin causes marked swelling and congestion of the vulva and vaginal mucosa that may be followed by vaginal prolapse.Affected pigs strain continuously and rectal prolapse is a common complication. Rectal prolapse in sheep The prolapsed rectum is edematous, congested, and there may be necrosis and ulceration of the everted mucosa. These lesions are ischemic in origin due to interference with venous blood flow from the prolapsed section. Only the mucosa, or all layers, may be involved in the prolapse. In swine surviving slough or amputation of the prolapsed tissue, rectal stricture may ensue. Rectal stricture is discussed further in the section on salmonellosis, below. \n\nIn dogs, and to a lesser extent in horses, cats, and other species, usually idiopathic syndromes occur, variably signaled by ckronic diarrkea, weigkt loss, kypoproteinemia, and malabsorption. Intestinal biopsy, wkere feasible, is usually necessary to make a diagnosis and establisk a prognosis. These syndromes are typically characterized by abnormal lamina proprial inflammatory infiltrates (eosinophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells, or granulomatous inflammation), neoplasia, especially lymphosarcoma, or amyloid, perhaps associated with villus atrophy. Lymphangiectasia may also produce a similar syndrome. Infectious causes of erosion or ulceration need to be considered, but are less common. In dogs giardiosis, and sequelae to severe parvoviral infections in animals recovered from the acute phase, may cause such a syndrome. In horses, chronic salmonellosis and Lawsonia are potential infectious causes of\" malassimilation and protein loss. The limitations on the interpretation of biopsies noted in the section on normal form and function of the intestine must be borne in mind. Neoplasia will be differentiated from inflammation, amyloidosis, and lymphangiectasia, and, rarely, characteristic lesions or an agent may be recognized, implicating an infectious process. If inflammatory bowel disease is recognized, associated or complicating problems, such as Giardia infection or bacterial overgrowth, should be sought. Associations with the dietary habits and history of the animal should also be investigated, since some cases may be associated with inappropriate responses to dietary antigen.\n\nLymphangiectasia has been described most commonly in the dog, where it is among the more common causes of malabsorption/protein-losing enteropathy; it has not been reported in cats. Breed predisposition seems limited to Yorkshire Terriers and the Norwegian Lundehund, in which lymphangiectasia is part of a syndrome of protein-losing enteropathy with inflammatory bowel disease and in which gastritis and gastric neoplasia may coexist. The disorder has also been reported in the horse. Lymphangiectasia is associated with a syndrome variably characterized by chronic diarrhea, wasting, hypoproteinemia, lymphopenia, hypocalcemia, and hypocholesterolemia. Peripheral edema, ascites, and hydrothorax result from hypoalbuminemia.\n\nThe lesion in the small intestine is dilation of the lacteals, and often lymphatics of the submucosa, muscularis, serosa, and mesentery ( Fig. 1.62) .Villi containing dilated chyle-filled lacteals may stand out grossly as white papillate loci in a thickened, transversely folded edematous mucosa. Serosal and mesenteric lymphatics may be prominent, white, and dilated. Nodular white masses up to 5-10 mm in size may be present on the serosa at the mesenteric border and along lymphatics; rarely, they are found on the liver, diaphragm, other abdominal organs, and pleura.\n\nIn section, villi may be of normal length or somewhat blunt or stubby, with some hypertrophy of crypts.The surface epithelium may appear normal or perhaps slightly attenuated, and lateral interepithelial spaces are often dilated. The lacteals in many villi are distended, and lymphatics in deeper portions of the mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis usually are. Occasional lipid-laden macrophages are present in and around lacteals and lymphatics; large focal accumulations of lipophages around lymphatics, sometimes with a local granulomatous response to lipid or saponified fat, form the white masses that may be seen grossly. A similar reaction may be present in the draining lymph nodes. The lamina propria is edematous, and the submucosa and deeper portions of the gut wall usually are. The proprial inflammatory cell population may be normal, or the numbers of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils may be increased, as in chronic inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nThe cause of lymphangiectasia may be lymphatic obstruction. Many cases appear to be acquired, and some may be due to lymphosarcomatous or granulomatous infiltrates obstructing flow in mesenteric lymph nodes. Lipogranulomas along the lymphatic drainage are inconsistent features of lymphangiectasia, and are probably in response to chronic leakage of lipid-laden chyle, rather than a cause of lymphatic obstruction. Usually, no congenital or acquired obstruction of the lymphatic system is obvious, though several dogs with lymphangiectasia have had chylothorax associated with thoracic duct obstruction. Experimental obstruction of mesenteric lymphatics produces hypoproteinemia and lymphangiectasia, but not diarrhea and weight loss, suggesting that the etiology of the clinical syndrome may be more complex than simple lymphatic obstruction. Increased vascular permeability associated with chronic inflammatory bowel disease may also contribute to mucosal edema and lymphatic dilation.\n\nModerate malabsorption of lipid, and plasma protein loss into the gut, causes the signs associated with lymphangiectasia. Malabsorbed lipid may contribute to diarrhea via the effects of fatty acids on colonic secretion. Mucosal permeability associated with increased proprial hydrostatic pressure may cause filtration secretion and contribute to plasma protein loss. It has been proposed that dilated lacteals may rupture, releasing lymph into the lumen of the intestine. Hypocalcemia may be related to loss of the mineral bound to plasma albumin, and perhaps to vitamin D malabsorption, or formation of soaps with malabsorbed lipid in the gut lumen. Hypocholesterolemia is due to lipid malabsorption and effusion of plasma. Lymphopenia is thought to be the result of the loss of lymphocyte-rich lymph into the gut.\n\nAmyloid deposition in the small intestine and stomach may occasionally be encountered in animals with systemic amyloidosis. Sometimes the gastrointestinal lesions predominate and contribute to the clinical syndrome. Significant intestinal amyloidosis leads to signs consistent with malabsorption and enteric protein loss. Usually there is no gross indication of the deposition of amyloid in the intestine. However, occasionally focal ulceration or hemorrhage may be noted. Microscopically, amyloid is seen beneath the epithelium or throughout the propria in villi, and perhaps around or within vessels in the submucosa (Fig. 1.63) . It must not be mistaken for collagen deposition, which is most unusual in these locations, though a band of collagenous material is sometimes present at the base of the mucosa in cats. The pathogenic effects of amyloid in the intestine seem to involve either impaired movement of interstitial fluid into lacteals or perhaps increased permeability of capillaries, possibly explaining protein loss into the lumen. Hayden DW, et \n\nSome animals, mainly dogs, but less commonly cattle, cats, and horses, showing signs consistent with malabsorption and/or plasma loss into the gut, have microscopic lesions in the mucosa of the small intestine described as chronic inflammatory bowel disease, lymphocyticplasmacytic enteritis, filled-villi syndrome, or eosinophilic gastroenteritis.\n\nThe latter phenomenon in cats and horses is often part of systemic eosinophilic syndromes affecting those species, considered separately below. In dogs, there is no proof that differentiation of eosinophilic gastroenteritis from chronic inflammatory bowel disease is clinically relevant, nor are there clear criteria for such differentiation, so the two will be considered together. In both dogs and cats, idiopathic mucosal colitis and gastritis may be present as components of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, perhaps with predominant signs reflecting gastric or colonic dysfunction; both are considered here. In contrast to the mucosal pattern of inflammation evident in these entities, inflammatory lesions of the large and small intestine of any species that include a significant population of macrophages usually adopt a transmural pattern, and may be associated with a specific etiology (e.g., Mycobacterium, Histoplasma) or represent a distinct syndrome (histiocytic ulcerative colitis of Boxers). They are described below with transmural granulomatous enteritis and with typhlocolitis. Inflammatory bowel disease is a clinical syndrome for which it is difficult to develop a valid, objective histologic counterpart, and it should be a diagnosis of last resort made by the clinician after alternatives such as food intolerance, motility disorders, and infectious disease have been ruled out. However, the thoroughness of the clinical and laboratory investigation prior to the use of endoscopic biopsy is influenced by the amount of time and money available to evaluate what are often elusive functional entities. Endoscopic biopsies are often done early, after symptomatic medical therapy has failed to control clinical signs. It is probably not appropriate for a pathologist to issue a diagnosis of \"inflammatory bowel disease;\" it is more appropriate simply to list the histologic findings and to indicate that the changes could be \"compatible with\" a clinical diagnosis of that syndrome.\n\nRegardless of the portion of the gastrointestinal tract under consideration, the histologic abnormalities are grouped under three broad headings: (1) changes in mucosal architecture reflecting active or recent epithelial abnormality; (2) increased numbers of proprial leukocytes; and (3) fibrosis within the lamina propria. Of these, the epithelial changes are the most reliable, yet the least prevalent. Subjective impressions of increased numbers of leukocytes within the lamina propria are the least reliable, but are the most widely used criterion for a diagnosis, simply because most biopsy samples do not have any other mucosal abnormalities.The pathologist, faced with substantial pressure to make some kind of diagnosis, may reach for the one observation that cannot be disproven (or proven): too many leukocytes.\n\nIn the small intestine, the cardinal finding is abnormally intense infiltrates of well-differentiated lymphocytes and plasma cells, and sometimes eosinophils, in the lamina propria of villi, between crypts and perhaps in the submucosa. However, normal intestine contains these types of cells and the distinction between normal and abnormal infiltrates is subjective, based on the position and number of cells in the villus. A layer of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and perhaps neutrophils or eosinophils more than about four cells thick, in the deep mucosa, below the crypts and above the muscularis mucosae, is abnormal (Fig. 1.64 ).\n\nVilli may be normal, clubbed, or moderately to severely atrophic, and occasionally fusion of villi may be prevalent (Fig. 1.65) .The surface epithelium may appear relatively normal, mucous metaplastic, or low columnar to cuboidal with an indistinct brush border. Intraepithelial lymphocytes may be common. Crypts may be hypertrophic and lined by numerous goblet cells; in other cases goblet cells are less obvious.There may be edema of the lamina propria and dilation of lacteals, suggesting concurrent lymphangiectasia, but usually the edema is not as severe as occurs with that lesion. In this and other conditions with increased inflammatory infiltrates or edema in the lamina propria, including lymphangiectasia, crypts may be obstructed and dilated, and contain mucus and a few exfoliated epithelial cells.\n\nThis has been termed cystic mucinous enteropathy; it is merely a severe variant oflymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis, and we see no benefit in expanding the nomenclature in an already-confused area. Occasionally, rupture of such crypts will be seen; lakes of mucus, reactive histiocytes, and occasional giant cells are present in the lamina propria ( Fig. 1.66 ). Other distended crypts may contain casts of eosinophilic glycoprotein.\n\nCare should be taken to differentiate chronic inflammatory bowel disease from early intestinal lymphoma (see discussion of Malignant lymphomas, below). Some suggest that, in the Basenji at least, the former can evolve into the latter.\n\nIdiopathic mueosal colitis is the colonic manifestation of chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and the commonest form of colitis recognized in dogs. It is etiologically nonspecific, occurring as chronic or chronic-active lymphocytic-plasmacytic or eosinophilic mucosal inflammation. Histiocytic ulcerative colitis is the distinctive pattern differentiated from it on microscopic grounds, along with rare cases of Histoplasma or protothecal colitis. Colitis is usually diffuse, so that even two or three endoscopic biopsies are probably enough to determine whether or not it is present.\n\nMild acute mucosal colitis, reflecting a grossly reddened friable surface visible on endoscopy, is characterized by congestion of superficial capillaries and venules, and proprial edema. Neutrophils infiltrate the superficial lamina propria around vessels, and transmigrate or pass between surface epithelial cells into the lumen. The population of lymphocytes and plasma cells in the lamina propria may not differ from normal, but there is generally a moderate increase in mononuclear cells, and perhaps eosinophils, which are usually rare in the superficial colonic mucosa, between glands.There are often few goblets on the surface and in glands, probably due to mucous discharge, rather than cell loss. Surface epithelium may be basophilic, low columnar, or cuboidal ( Fig. 1.67A, B) . Hyperplasia of epithelium in glands may be evident, and glands dilate. Inflammatory cells, mainly neutrophils, but perhaps lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils, may accumulate excessively along the mucosal side of the muscularis mucosae, as in inflammatory disease involving the small intestine. The lesions in mild acute colitis often seem mild in proportion to the severity of the clinical syndrome.\n\nThe spectrum of inflammation in colitis grades from acute towards an increasingly chronic infiltrate, which, along with edema, separates colonic glands and may accumulate deep in the mucosa between glands and muscularis mucosae (Fig. 1.67D ). Neutrophils and eosinophils may be scattered among round cells in the propria, and transmigrating surface and glandular epithelium. Globule leukocytes may be prevalent.Accumulation of granulocytes and necrotic debris in the lumen of glands forms so-called crypt abscesses.\n\nGreater severity of the lesion is reflected in attenuation and exfoliation of surface epithelium, and the development of microerosions on the mucosal surface ( Fig. 1.67C ). Inflammatory cells, mainly neutrophils, and tissue fluid effuse into the lumen through defects in the epithelium. Persistent erosion, or previous erosion in a healed mucosa, is marked by the development of a thin, horizontally arrayed layer of connective tissue in the superficial lamina propria. With increasing chronicity in colitis of mild or moderate degree, there may be deposition within the lamina propria of a collagenous stroma, throughout which inflammatory cells are interspersed, which separates glands abnormally throughout the mucosa. Downgrowth of glands into often-involuted submucosal lymphoid follicles may occur in chronic colitis.\n\nSevere erosion and ulceration are usually associated with local acute inflammation and with a heavy, mainly mononuclear cell infiltrate in the lamina propria, and often in the submucosa. The ulcerated areas extend usually no further than the muscularis mucosae, and have a base of granulation tissue heavily infiltrated by neutrophils that effuse into the lumen of the bowel. The margin of surviving mucosa may overhang the ulcer. Crypt abscesses may be present in remaining mucosa, and all degrees of erosion and partial ulceration may be present. Idiopathic ulcerative colitis is uncommon, and does not seem as severe as histiocytic ulcerative colitis of Boxers; it rarely comes to autopsy. Severely affected dogs may be cachectic, probably due in part to enteric loss of plasma protein. The mucosa in ulcerative colitis is usually deep red, swollen, folded, and granular due to edema and cellular infiltrates; the depressions may be punctate or up to several centimeters across, roughly round or oval, irregular or elongate. Their margins may be tattered or puckered. Colonic lymph nodes may be enlarged and edematous.\n\nIn canine colitis, there is a broad three-dimensional spectrum: (1) in relative chronicity and density of the inflammatory infiltrate; (2) in the distribution of the infiltrate within the wall of the bowel; and (3) in the severity of the epithelial and mucosal change. Generally, milder lesions of superficial epithelium are associated with mild or moderate mucosal inflammation, which may be acute or chronic. In many cases of mild chronic mucosal colitis, the glands do not appear particularly hyperplastic. However, defective repair in the face of severe or ongoing injury may result in crypts that are tortuous or even nearly horizontal, and papillary hyperplasia of the epithelial surface. Severe erosion and ulceration are usually related to a more intense or heavy chronic inflammatory process, which may be limited to the mucosa, but which can extend into the submucosa. Truly granulomatous colitis is rare; when fully developed, perhaps as a component of regional enteritis involving the ileocecocolic area, or in histiocytic colitis of Boxer dogs, considered later, it is ulcerative and transmural. Occasionally, a granulomatous response to barium, or to other foreign material breaching the epithelium, may be observed in the mucosa and submucosa. Atrophk colitis, in which the mucosa is markedly thinned, with relatively inactive crypts and modest chronic or chronic-active interstitial inflammation, perhaps with notable interstitial fibrosis, is occasionally encountered.\n\nGastric changes in dogs or cats with clinically suspected inflammatory bowel disease are challenging to interpret, because of variation in normal microscopic anatomy within the stomach, and because gastric lesions are often patchy.As well, ingestion of chemicals and foreign bodies can create gastric lesions misinterpreted as being those of inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nThe stomach has a variety of normal anatomic features and common back2wund lesions that have not been proven to have any functional significance.These include a dense band ofhyalinized fibrous tissue (lamina densa) between the muscularis mucosae and the base of the crypts in cats, lymphoid nodules within the deep lamina propria of both dogs and cats, and a substantial amount of fibrous tissue within the lamina propria of the pyloric antrum. It is not clear whether some of these have any significance as signposts of previous disease. Background lesions that may or may not be correlated with some previous specific stimulus include globule leukocytes in the gastric epithelium of cats, and a combination of gastric proprial fibrosis, glandular atrophy, and glandular nesting within the fundic mucosa. While we assume (without proof) that such fibrosis and glandular atrophy are sequelae to previous inflammation or necrosis, such changes have not been correlated with gastric dysfunction or clinical illness.\n\nUnlike the situation in the intestinal and colonic mucosa, epithelial injury is not a prominent part of 2astritis in dogs or cats. It is rare to encounter erosion or ulceration as part of gastritis, and acute ulceration associated with chemical or mechanical injury to the stomach has little mucosal cellular infiltrate. It is therefore prudent to distinguish gastric ulceration from gastritis. Lesions compatible with a diagnosis of gastritis include leukocytic infiltrates in the superficial third of the mucosa, mucous metaplasia and hyperplasia in fundic glands, extensive lymphoplasmacytic and/or eosinophilic infiltrates deep in the mucosa, interstitial fibrosis, and associated atrophy of glands. The diagnosis of gastric mucosal atrophy must be made with great care because there is substantial difference in mucosal thickness between various portions of the stomach, and even within the same anatomic region. Most discussions of inflammatory bowel disease assume that the change in mucosal cellularity is primary and that characterization of that cellularity should provide the greatest insight into pathogenesis and therapy. However, assessment of mucosal cellularity is almost entirely subjective and has exceedingly poor interobserver agreement. There are no useful objective reference intervals for small intestinal mucosal cellularity because the range is so broad, and accurate identification of the different cell types is problematic. Characterization of the immunophenotype of lymphocytes in the small intestine has produced variable results that have yet to be usefully associated with the presence or absence of clinical signs.\n\nAttempts to create more objective grading systems for the histologic assessment of inflammatory bowel disease have stressed the significance of architectural changes within the surface epithelium and lamina propria rather than relying exclusively on shifts in total or relative leukocyte populations. Such grading criteria include detection of villus or cryptal enterocyte injury (villus fusion, superficial ulceration, enterocyte flattening and basophilia, cryptal hyperplasia), as well as remodeling of mucosal architecture (separation of the crypts from one another or from the muscularis mucosae by edema, fibrosis, and/or leukocytes). However, these schemes still fail to resolve the dilemma of substantial overlap between \"normal\" and subjectively increased leukocyte numbers in mild inflammatory bowel disease in which there is no epithelial injury or architectural change.\n\nSkepticism about the utility of estimating leukocyte numbers or identifying shifts in phenotype among mucosal leukocytes may not be so appropriate when looking at colonic and gastric inflammatory disease. Perhaps because of its lesser overall proprial cellularity in comparison with small intestine, or perhaps because of its greater accessibility to biopsy, the colonic mucosa was the first part of the canine intestinal tract to be subjected to morphometric grading of architectural changes and objective leukocyte counting, although application of such data is difficult. In comparison with small intestine, the normal range in leukocyte numbers is narrower and the overall population much smaller in both colon and stomach. This is particularly true of the granulocytes. The presence of neutrophils within the lamina propria of any part of the intestine is probably abnormal, and is probably a reliable marker for recent epithelial damage or permeability. Eosinophils have more variation, and often are present in very large numbers throughout the small intestinal mucosa. However, they are very sparse within the superficial half of the canine colonic mucosa, and are infrequent within the gastric mucosa.\n\nSince the normal stomach has relatively few mucosal leukocytes, the pursuit of a diagnosis of gastritis based upon objective assessment of leukocyte numbers may be a credible goal.While it has been possible, by counting different types of leukocytes identified by routine histology and immunohistochemistry, to establish reference intervals for eosinophils, plasma cells, B cells, and T cells within various parts of the gastric lamina propria of healthy dogs, more than half of the round cells in the normal canine gastric lamina propria could not be precisely identified. Healthy dogs had an eighffold range in total mucosal cellularity, and the pyloric antrum was three times more cellular than the fundic mucosa. Although dogs with clinical signs of gastritis had an objective increase in eosinophils, plasma cells, and/or intraepithelial lymphocytes in many different combinations, it was difficult to correlate clinical severity or response to therapy with cellular or other parameters of gastric mucosal abnormality. There was no significance to whether the inflammation was limited to the superficial third of the mucosa or was found throughout, although the former was more common than the latter. In a second study of idiopathic gastritis, all cases were classified as lymphocytic, and T cells predominated. Eosinophils were not a significant component, and there was no observed regional variation in severity.\n\nWhile it is certainly possible (or even probable) that precise identification and quantitation of the infiltrating leukocytes will emerge as significant when we have more precise ways of measuring clinical severity and response to therapy, currently there is no pragmatic clinical significance to distinguishing eosinophilic from lymphocytic gastritis, commenting on whether the lesions are superficial or more diffuse, or making any statement about histologic severity with respect to leukocytes or other aspects of mucosal architecture.\n\nThe etiopathogenesis of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease is not understood in any animal species.The nature of the inflammatory infiltrate suggests that loss of tolerance to dietary antigen or antigens produced by the enteric microflora may be implicated. The common morphologic changes in the mucosa-of cryptal hypertrophy, villus atrophy, and, in severe cases, mucous metaplasia of surface enterocytes, may be side-effects ofT-cell-mediated activity in the mucosa. Similar lesions occur in humans with celiac disease (glutensensitive enteropathy), which is T-cell mediated. An immunophenotypic investigation of inflammatory bowel disease in cats noted outcomes consistent with dysregulation of immunoinflammatory events. Major histocompatibility complex class II expression by proprial round cells and enterocytes was more pronounced than in the control population.\n\nLymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis associated with familial sensitivity to wheat protein has been demonstrated in Irish Setters, but not in Basenji dogs, which as a breed seem predisposed to the problem. In Basenjis and in the Lundehund, syndromes of hypoalbuminemia, chronic diarrhea, and wasting occur with high prevalence, primarily attributable to lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis, with lymphangiectasia in some dogs. In the Base@, chronic gastritis or hypertrophic gastritis may be associated, and malassimilation and plasma protein loss into the gut have been documented. Hypergammaglobulinemia commonly occurs in the late stages of the syndrome in Basenjis, and lymphosarcoma develops in some affected animals. In this sense, the syndrome resembles immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (oL-heavy chain disease, or Mediterranean lymphoma), which is a disorder of IgA immunoblasts in humans. IgA plasmacytes do not dominate in the Basenji intestinal mucosa; though high circulating levels of IgA are present, it is not known if they are associated with abnormal R-heavy-chain protein. In cats, dogs, and horses, submucosal or transmural lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates may signal a precursor to lymphoma, and the infiltrating cell population must be carefully evaluated; a monomorphic population of lymphocytes, blurring of the proprial-epithelial interface by lymphocytic infiltrates, and mitotic activity suggest lymphosarcoma.\n\nAnimals with the gray Collie syndrome (cyclic neutropenia) may also have lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis (seeVol. 3, Hematopoietic system). Cebra \n\nEosinophilic enteritis in cats is rare, and appears to be one manifestation of a hypereosinophilic syndrome that may involve many organs in middle-aged or older cats. It is much more severe than eosinophilic gastroenteritis in dogs. Diarrhea, sometimes bloody, vomition, loss of appetite, and loss of condition may occur. Clinically, intestinal thickening, hepato-and splenomegaly, and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes may be present, in association with circulating eosinophilia and hyperplasia of the eosinophil series in the marrow.\n\nThe postmortem picture reflects the clinical findings. Enlargement of the various organs, including liver, spleen, lymph nodes in many locations, and tan nodularities on the kidneys, is associated with heavy infiltrates of usually well-differentiated eosinophils. In the small intestine, the eosinophilic infiltrate may be transmural and is accompanied by grossly visible hypertrophy of the muscle layers ( Fig. 1.68) . Eosinophilic colitis may occur in some cases. Lymph nodes may have hyperplastic follicles and many mature eosinophils in sinusoids. Alternatively they may vary through eosinophilic lymphadenitis with fibrosis to complete obliteration of normal architecture and replacement by eosinophils in a fibrillar stroma extending through the capsule into surrounding tissue.\n\nChronic eosinophilic enteritis in horses has been described as part of a distinct multisystemic epitheliotropic syndrome, associated with eosinophilic granulomatous pancreatitis and eosinophilic dermatitis, among other lesions. Affected animals have weight loss, and diarrhea or unformed feces, associated with hypoalbuminemia, suggesting enteric loss of plasma protein. Reduced absorption of glucose occurs, but peripheral eosinophilia is absent.At autopsy, mucosal and sometimes transmural thickening may occur at any level of the alimentary tract from esophagus to rectum. Esophageal and gastric squamous mucosa is hyperkeratotic. Thickened mucosa is thrown into turgid transverse folds, or occasionally is fissured and roughened. Focal or diffuse ulcers may be present on the small and large intestine and focal caseous lesions up to 1.5 cm in diameter may be in the submucosa of the gut and common bile duct, as well as in an enlarged fibrotic pancreas.\n\nMicroscopically there is diffuse infiltration of the mucosa, submucosa, and often deeper layers of the enteric wall by eosinophils, mast cells, macrophages, lymphocytes and some plasma cells. Moderate to severe villus atrophy, fibroplasia in the lamina propria, and hypertrophy of the muscularis mucosae occur. Caseous foci in the mucosa and submucosa consist of central masses of eosinophils, sometimes surrounded by macrophages, giant cells, and occasionally fibrous tissue. Eosinophilic interstitial infiltrates and granulomas are described in the biliary and pancreatic ducts, pancreas, salivary glands, capsule, and outer cortex of enlarged firm mesenteric lymph nodes, and near portal tracts in the liver. The skin may be thickened and hyperkeratotic and the limbus of the hoof thickened and ulcerated. The eosinophilic dermatitis is described in Vol. 1, Skin and appendages.\n\nVillus atrophy is common, but if large-bowel lesions are absent, there is no diarrhea. Chronic inflammation in the mucosa may explain protein loss and hypoalbuminemia. The cause of this syndrome is unknown.A hypersensitivity response to migrating parasitic larvae has been suggested, as has the possibility that undetected T-cell lymphoma secreting interleukin-5 may be responsible.\n\nThe presence of chronic inflammatory infiltrates, including aggregates of histiocvtes, and t~erhat~s oiant cells, in the lamina t~rot~ria is the criterion for a diagnosis of granulomatous enteritis. With time, the inflammatory reaction typically follows lymphatics transmurally into the submucosa and through the muscularis to the serosa. The submucosa is usually edematous, and lymphatics are prominent. Granulomas may be present in the submucosa or at intervals along lymphatics. The affected lymph nodes are hyperplastic, usually with prominent sinus histiocytosis. Giant cells may be present in sinusoids, or granulomatous foci of various sizes may be evident. Sinusoids contain numerous neutrophils and perhaps eosinophils, and neutrophils may accumulate in the center of granulomas.\n\nGranulomatous enteritis can potentially occur in all species.Johne's disease, other intestinal mycobacterioses, and Histoplasma enteritis are specific examples (see section on Infectious and parasitic diseases of the alimentary tract, below). Often the cause is not identified.\n\nTransmural granulomatous enteritis is occasionally seen in dogs and cats. It is generally segmental and perhaps discontinuous in distribution, usually affecting the lower ileum, colon, and draining lymph nodes. Due to the extent of the attendant fibrosis, these lesions may be stenotic, and must be differentiated from invasive carcinoma. In dogs, there may be marked necrosis in the centers of granulomas and considerable fibrosis.\n\nIdiopathic granulomatous enteritis as a cause of wasting and protein-losing enteropathy is most commonly seen as a sporadic problem in horses. Depending on the duration of the disease, animals may be markedly cachectic, have subcutaneous edema, especially of dependent areas, and there may be hydrothorax, hydropericardium, and ascites. Lesions in the horse usually affect the small intestine; stomach and large bowel are occasionally also involved. Mesenteric lymph nodes are usually enlarged, edematous, with mottled firm gray areas, fibrotic nodules, or, rarely, caseous or mineralized foci on the cut surface. Granulomatous pale, caseous, or calcified foci may be scattered in the liver.\n\nThe microscopic lesion may be patchy, regional, or diffuse, and it may be mucosal, or transmural, ultimately gaining the draining lymph nodes. Transmural inflammation is characteristically granulomatous. Villi are mildly to markedly atrophic with hypertrophy of crypts.The epithelium may vary from apparently normal to low columnar or cuboidal with an indistinct brush border. There may be leaks between cells on the surface, or microerosions may be present, through which neutrophils and proteinaceous exudate pass into the lumen. The lamina propria is edematous and contains scattered aggregates of histiocytes and perhaps giant cells, or, less commonly, more organized granulomatous foci. Neutrophils and eosinophils are distributed diffusely throughout the lamina propria, and may be concentrated in or near granulomatous foci.A heavy population of lymphocytes and plasma cells inhabits the lamina propria, and the infiltrate and edema may separate crypts abnormally from each other.\n\nRarely are agents identified in such lesions. Mycobacterium avium or environmental mycobacteria are occasionally incriminated. Anaerobiospirillum has been implicated as the cause of ileocolitis in cats.\n\nThe general reaction to injury of the cecal and colonic epithelium was considered earlier in the section on Epithelial renewal in health and disease.\n\nIschemia, obliteration of the proliferative epithelium by viruses or coccidia, severe inflammation in the mucosa, and necrotizing toxic insults from the lumen are responsible for the development of focal or diffuse ulceration of the large intestine. Inflammatory infiltrates in the lamina propria may be broadly classified as acute, chronic, or chronic-active, and granulomatous.They may be limited in distribution to the mucosa or be transmural, involving submucosa, muscularis, serosa, and frequently the draining lymph nodes. Typhlitis and colitis may be manifestations of a generalized or systemic disease; they may be part of an enterocolitis involving both small and large intestine; or they may be regional and limited to a segment of the intestine, often terminal ileum, cecum, and colon, or some shorter part of the large bowel.\n\nThe damaged colonic mucosa may provide the portal of entry for systemic bacterial invasion and for uptake of toxins. Increased mucosal permeability in the colon may permit enteric loss of plasma protein or of blood. Disordered large-bowel flora in hindgut fermenters may compromise uptake of volatile fatty acids and water. In any species, damage to the colonic mucosa may result in malabsorption of electrolytes and water, and perhaps net secretion. Colitis in each of the species will be considered in turn.\n\nColitis cystica profunda, the presence of dilated colonic glands protruding through the muscularis mucosae into the submucosa, is seen in several species, most commonly in swine. The cause is unknown; the lesion may be a sequel to colitis and local damage to the muscularis mucosae, or it may represent herniation into the space left by an involuted submucosal lymphoid follicle. Though the lesion has been seen with colitis in a variety of circumstances, especially in swine dysentery, it may also be found incidentally, with no specific etiologic association.\n\nInflammation of the large bowel in dogs is usually associated with diarrhea, typically frequent, small in volume, mucoid or bloody, and often accompanied by tenesmus. By far the most common form encountered in dogs is idiopathic mucosal colitis, considered above in Idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nSevere acute necrotizing colitis and, less commonly, typhlitis, leading to ulceration and peoCoration, with subsequent peritonitis, has been associated with glucocorticoid administration, functional adrenal cortical tumors, and with trauma or surgery involving the spinal cord. Gastric ulceration may occur concurrently. The perforations usually occur in the antimesenteric border of the left colonic flexure or proximal descending colon, though they are reported from the cecum, ascending, transverse, and distal descending colon. The pathogenesis of the colonic lesions developing in these circumstances is unclear, but it does not seem to be associated with the interface between the cranial and sacral fields of autonomic nervous control, as has been proposed. Necrotizing colitis, ulceration, and perforation may occur rarely in dogs in uremia. The mechanism is uncertain, but colonic damage may be the effect of high concentrations of ammonia evolved by urease-producing colonic flora from urea diffusing into the gut from the blood. The lesions are often associated with arteritis, and fibrinoid necrosis, mineralization, and destruction of the media are seen, especially in ruminants.\n\nTrichuris vulpis, the whipworm of dogs, may cause mucosal colitis, which rarely evolves into a granulomatous transmural condition. Clinical trichuriasis is generally associated with a population of worms that extends from the usual site of infection in the cecum and proximal ascending colon into more distal parts of the large intestine.\n\nUlcerative colitis in dogs is also rarely caused by Entamoeba histolytica. Ulcerative, granulomatous transmural colitis is more common as one of the enteric manifestations of histoplasrnosis. Prototheca is also a cause of distinctive but rare enterocolitis in dogs, and colitis characterized by a hea W mucosal infiltrate of macrophages, in which the agent may be found, is reported in leishmaniasis. Canine parvovirus causes colonic damage, but in virtually all cases, there are more severe lesions elsewhere, notably in the small intestine. Canine coronavirus has also been implicated as a cause of colonic, as well as small intestinal, lesions. These conditions are discussed fully in the section on Infectious and parasitic diseases of the alimentary tract, later in this chapter. Spirochetes may be present in the canine colon and their association with diarrheal disease is controversial.There is some indication that predisposing factors, particularly giardiasis, may result in hea W colonization of the mucosal surface, with resulting diarrhea.\n\nCampylobacter jejuni is isolated from dogs both with and without diarrhea, but has been implicated as an etiology of enterocolitis in some situations of outbreaks of diarrhea in dog colonies. In these cases, large aggregates of organisms can be visualized within crypt lumens.\n\nHistiocytic ulcerative colitis is a distinctive histologic syndrome, which has been recognized in Boxers and the related French Bulldog. It is a chronic transmural ulcerative colitis characterized by the presence of large numbers of macrophages containing periodic acid-Schiff-positive granules, in the deep mucosa and submucosa, and in lymph nodes receiving drainage from the colon. Clinically affected animals are usually under 2 years of age.This condition causes typical large-bowel diarrhea, with mucus and blood; weight loss occurs and chronic cases may become cachectic, probably due to protein loss into the gut.\n\nGwssly, the colon of dogs with advanced disease is variably thickened, folded, and perhaps dilated and shortened with some segmental or focal areas of scarring and stricture. Lesions on the mucosa may vary from patchy punctate red ulcers to more extensive irregular circular or linear lesions that may coalesce, leaving only a few islands of persistent mucosa on a granulating colonic surface ( Fig. 1.69A ).\n\nEarly microscopic lesions are those of mild nonspecific inflammation.\n\nGoblet cells disappear from the surface and glands. Microerosion of epithelium in the upper glands and on the surface is associated with local acute inflammation, migration of neutrophils into the epithelium, and effusion of neutrophils and tissue fluid into the lumen. Macrophages in these areas may contain phagocytized necrotic debris and bacteria. In some areas the mucosa is thinned, and glands are relatively shortened, though lining epithelium appears hyperplastic. Macrophages with cytoplasmic vacuoles, which contain periodic acid-Schiff-positive material, are mainly deep in the lamina propria, raising the base of crypts from the muscularis mucosae, and in the submucosa ( Fig. 1.69B, C) . Sometimes they may be relatively sparse in the mucosa, and may be missed in small biopsy specimens if the submucosa is not sampled.These same cells may be found about lymphatics in the muscularis and the serosa, and they may be numerous in subcapsular, cortical, and medullary sinuses in the draining lymph nodes.The cecum is often involved, to a lesser degree, with similar lesions. Ulceration seems to progress from the superficial epithelial erosion and destruction of the basement membrane seen in early lesions. Ulcers usually do not progress beyond the submucosa, and they are lined by granulation tissue. The bed of the ulcer is necrotic, and numerous neutrophils and erythrocytes may be passing into the lumen.\n\nThe cause of the condition is unknown, as is the origin of the material in the characteristic vacuoles in macrophages. Ultrastructural study suggests that these are digestion vacuoles containing mainly remnants of phospholipid membranes. The material being digested may be phagocytized cell debris and microorganisms picked up in the superficial lamina propria and carried in \"constipated\" macrophages to deeper structures. The involvement of a variety of infectious agents has been postulated. It seems that a defect in lysosomal function may exist in some Boxer dogs that can lead to the accumulation of partially digested phospholipid membrane in macrophages, since similar histiocytes do not accumulate in ulcerative colitis in other breeds of dogs. \n\nColitis in cats is uncommon. Idiopathic mucosal colitis, similar to that described in dogs, occurs occasionally in cats, and has been included in the discussion of Idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease above. Tritrichomonas foetus, associated with persistent largebowel diarrhea and idiopathic mucosal colitis in cats under about a year of age, is considered in the section on Infectious and parasitic diseases of the alimentary tract, later in this chapter.\n\nFeline panleukopenia virus causes colonic lesions in about half the cases. They are similar to, but rarely as severe or widespread as, the lesions found in the small intestine.The relative paucity and mildness of lesions in the colon are related to the lower rate of epithelial proliferation in comparison with the small intestine. Panleukopenia is considered in the section on Infectious and parasitic diseases of the alimentary tract, later in this chapter.\n\nMycotic colitis is occasionally seen in cats as a hemorrhagic ulcerative colitis in which focal or diffuse mucosal invasion by Candida, zygomycetes, or Aspergillus has occurred, sometimes causing microvascular thrombosis. These invaders occur mainly secondary to colonic damage and leukopenia caused by panleukopenia.\n\nClostridium piliforme caused mild mucosal colitis in several kittens with soft feces and vague central nervous disorder, but no other obvious intercurrent disease. The lesions were characterized by hypertrophy of crypts; exfoliation of epithelium into the lumen of crypts, which were dilated and lined by flattened epithelium; and a moderate chronic interstitial inflammatory infiltrate.Vegetative forms and spores of C. piliforme were recognized ultrastructurally in crypt epithelium. Lesions were not evident elsewhere. It has also occurred in kittens presumably immunocompromised by panleukopenia.\n\nNecrotic colitis, a condition seen predominantly in older animals, is characterized by severe damage to colonic glands ( Fig. 1.70) . The cause is thought to be ischemia.\n\nTransmural acute ulcerative colitis, with a heavy infiltrate of neutrophils, is the hallmark of Salmonella Typhimurium infection in cats, considered more fully with salmonellosis in the section on Infectious and parasitic diseases of the alimentary tract, later in this chapter.\n\nAnaerobiospiriUum, associated with colitis in cats, is discussed in the section on Bacterial diseases of the alimentary tract, below.\n\nUlcerative colitis, grossly and microscopically similar to idiopathic ulcerative colitis of the dog, occurs very rarely in cats. Granulomatous or pyogranulomatous foci in the subserosa or submucosa may cause regional enterocolitis, characterized by fibrosis and serosal nodularity of affected segments, usually without severe mucosal defects. Fibrinoid arteritis causing hemorrhage and edema in the colonic submucosa, and ischemic necrosis of the mucosa, is also reported.The granulomatous syndrome is attributed to Feline infectious peritonitis virus, and there may be characteristic lesions in other organs. O 1982:23:197-199 . \n\nThe diagnosis of acute colitis in horses resolves into the differentiation of peracute and acute salmonellosis, Potomac horse fever (equine monocytic ehrlichiosis), and intestinal clostridiosis. Colitis must also be differentiated from the sequelae of intestinal accidents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug intoxication, and thromboembolism involving the large bowel.\n\nEquine intestinal clostridiosis is increasingly well defined as an entity. Previously, many of these cases were lumped into an umbrella category,\"colitis X\"a severe acute colitis in which all known etiologic agents were ruled out.At necropsy the animal is dehydrated, and there may be subcutaneous and serosal petechial hemorrhage. The blood is dark and clots poorly. Enteric lesions are virtually limited to the large bowel, which is distended, with abnormally fluid content. The serosa of the cecum and large colon may appear cyanotic from congestion and hemorrhage in the mucosa (Fig. 1.71 ) and perhaps submucosa. The deeper tissues of the intestinal wall are not compromised, as is usually the case in volvulus and often in thromboembolic infarction. The mucosa and submucosa are commonly markedly edematous, and edema is often present at the mesenteric attachment of the gut and in the cecal and colic lymph nodes.The mucosa may appear brown and necrotic with focal fibrinohemorrhagic exudate on the surface. More commonly, it is deeply congested with focal hemorrhage, but blood is rarely present to significant degree in the contents. Gross lesions in other organs are those consistent with circulatory or endotoxic shock. The microscopic lesions in the large bowel include superficial or full-thickness necrosis of the mucosa, associated with dilation and perhaps thrombosis of small mucosal and submucosal venules. There is hemorrhage and edema in the mucosa, and the submucosa is markedly edematous, with dilated lymphatics.Variable numbers of bacilli are associated with these lesions. Some neutrophils may be evident in the mucosa or submucosa, and fibrin may be effusing from the damaged mucosal surface in less advanced cases. Submucosal lymphoid follicles show evidence of recent severe lymphocytolysis.\n\nCongestion, microvascular thrombosis, and hemorrhage may be found in a variety of other organs, especially the adrenal cortex.\n\nClostridium pegringens type A is the most common clostridial species associated with this syndrome. Most horses carry this organism within their intestines. In addition, C. diflTcile has been associated with equine clostridial colitis. Equine intestinal clostridiosis may occur after dysbacteriosis, instigated by antibiotic therapy (especially the tetracyclines), stress, or changes in feeding regimens.With overgrowth of C. pe~ingens type A, ~2 toxin-secreting C. pe~ingens type A or C. difficile exotoxins cause severe acute mucosal damage. There is a positive association between the disease and the presence of C. pe~ingens enterotoxin and/or C. difl~cile toxin.\n\nSubacute and chronic diarrhea in horses almost always involves the large intestine, with or without concomitant small-bowel involvement. Salmonella typhlocolitis must be suspected in such cases. Salmonellosis in horses may have an extremely variable course and pathologic manifestations (see section on Infectious and parasitic diseases of the alimentary tract, later in this chapter). Potomac horse fever usually results in diarrhea that does not exceed 10 days in duration; at necropsy there is congestion and ulceration of the mucosa of the large bowel, and enlargement of mesenteric lymph nodes. Suppurative ulcers involving lymphoid tissue in the typhlocolic mucosa, and cecal and colic lymphadenitis, characterize enteric infection with Rhodococcus equi in foals. Histoplasmosis has been reported once in a horse with salmonellosis and ulcerative colitis. Extensive mucosal involvement by larval cyathostomes and strongyles and, rarely, ulcerative typhlitis due to anoplocephalid tapeworms, may also cause diarrhea and wasting; they are discussed under specific parasitisms.\n\nCiliate protozoa may be seen in the colonic mucosa of horses dead of a variety of enteric and nonenteric problems; the tissues are frequently autolytic, are rarely inflamed, and the protozoa are terminal or postmortem invaders. Intralesional protozoa have, however, been reported in a horse with diffuse eosinophilic colitis.\n\nChronic diarrhea and possibly cachexia may also result from persistent ulceration of the cecum or colon due to ischemic mucosal lesions.These may be the product of arterial thromboembolism and slow flow, or less likely, corrected strangulation with reflow. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has also been associated with cecal and colonic ulceration and plasma protein loss.\"Right dorsal colitis\" in which ulcerative lesions are limited to the named part of the large bowel, may be associated with colic, and acute or chronic diarrhea. This syndrome and others associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories are considered with ischemia due to reduced perfusion (see section on Intestinal ischemia and infarction, above). The specific cause of extensive ulceration may be difficult to determine. Smaller chronic ulcers and widespread subacute erosion and ulceration are most likely the result of salmonellosis, rather than ischemia.A history of administration ofnonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and the presence of lesions in the renal papilla, mouth, and upper alimentary tract, suggests intoxication by those agents. \n\nThe differential diagnosis of typhlocolitis in swine mainly revolves around identifying swine dysentery and other spirochetoses, Salmonella enterocolitis, and Lawsonia intracellularis infection. Swine dysentery, caused by Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, involves only the cecum and spiral colon. It is a catarrhal to mildly fibrinohemorrhagic erosive mucosal typhlocolitis.The colonic content is fluid and usually blood-tinged. A similar but milder disease, intestinal spirochetosis, is associated with B. pilosicoli, which causes distinctive microscopic lesions as it colonizes the apex of surface epithelium. Salmonella enterocolitis, mainly due to S. Typhimurium, is a fibrinous, erosive to focally ulcerative condition, mainly of the cecum and colon, but perhaps involving the small intestine, especially terminal ileum.The content is fluid but usually not bloody. Mesenteric lymph nodes are prominent. L. intracellularis infection is readily recognized by the consistent concurrent involvement of the terminal ileum by adenomatosis, with or without hemorrhage, or by necrotic ileitis.\n\nPostweaning colibacillosis is characterized by catarrhal to mild fibrinohemorrhagic enterocolitis in piglets after weaning.\n\nFibrinohemorrhagic typhlitis is caused by heavy infestations with Trichuris suis, especially in weaned pigs with access to pastures and yards. Under similar circumstances, Eimeria infection may rarely cause ileotyphlocolitis.\n\nRectal stricture appears to be a product ofischemic proctitis, probably related in many cases to infection with S. Typhimurium.\n\nDetails of these conditions are discussed in the section on Infectious and parasitic diseases of the alimentary tract, later in this chapter.\n\nDiagnostic considerations in cattle over 2-3 months of age with acute to subacute fibrinohemorrhagic typhlocolitis include salmonellosis, bovine viral diarrhea, rinderpest (in enzootic areas or populations at risk), coccidiosis, adenoviral infection, and winter dysentery (coronavirus). Lesions of the oral cavity and upper alimentary tract may be expected, but are not necessarily present, in bovine viral diarrhea and rinderpest. Bovine coronavirus causes microscopic lesions in colonic crypts in cattle with winter dysentery; mild fibrinous typhlocolitis may be seen grossly. Salmonellosis affects all age groups from neonate to adult and may frequently involve both small and large intestine in catarrhal to fibrinohemorrhagic enteritis; mesenteric lymph nodes are usually enlarged. Coccidiosis may involve ileum and large intestine; it can usually be diagnosed by mucosal scraping at autopsy. Bovine adenovirus infection may cause severe hemorrhagic colitis, with few lesions elsewhere. Arsenic, other heavy metals, and oak or acorn poisoning may also cause hemorrhagic typhlocolitis and dysentery. Rarely, trichuriasis causes hemorrhagic mucosal typhlitis in calves.\n\nChronic fibrinous or ulcerative typhlocolitis may occur in salmonellosis, bovine viral diarrhea, and coccidiosis.\n\nGranulomatous typhlocolitis associated with chronic diarrhea and wasting may occur in Johne's disease, concurrently with granulomatous ileitis and mesenteric lymphadenitis.The mucosa of the large bowel in these cases is thickened and rugose. Impressions of affected mucosa or ileocecal lymph node will contain acid-fast bacilli.Johne's disease in sheep and goats is usually associated with wasting, but often not diarrhea.The large bowel may be involved in a minority of cases; the ileum is consistently affected.\n\nIn sheep, hemorrhagic typhlocolitis may be present in animals with bluetongue and peste des petits ruminants; it is rarely the only lesion. Salmonellosis may cause fibrinohemorrhagic enteritis in lambs and pregnant ewes, and typhlitis caused by trichuriasis will occur rarely, although the presence of parasites in small numbers is common in weaners. Coccidiosis may be implicated in hemorrhagic ileotyphlocolitis in lambs and kids, though the small intestine is usually more commonly and severely involved. In goats, enterotoxemia due to C. pe~ingens type D may cause mild to moderately severe fibrinohemorrhagic typhlocolitis. Uremia may cause hemorrhagic lesions associated with vasculitis in the cecum and colon.\n\nTumors of the lower gastrointestinal tract are not common in domestic animals. However, they are relatively prevalent among surgical biopsy submissions from dogs and cats, in sharp contrast to their rarity in horses and food-producing animals. Malignant neoplasms are more common than benign tumors, and, excepting lymphosarcoma, most are carcinomas. Polyps are generally hyperplastic rather than neoplastic. The exceptions are rectal polyps in dogs, which are adenomas or carcinomas. Highly malignant scirrhous adenocarcinomas of the stomach and intestine occur in all species. Lymphosarcoma is the most common malignant tumor of mesenchymal origin in most species. It may arise in the gut, although involvement of this area is often part of multicentric disease (see Vol. 3, Hematopoietic system). The third major category of gastrointestinal tumors is stromal, mainly phenotypically smooth muscle or undifferentiated. Elaborate classification schemes have been proposed based on histologic or immunophenotypic characterization with, in many cases, little evidence that they are relevant to the biological behavior of the tumor or its response to therapy. Furthermore, there is often so much variation within these lesions that it is difficult to make them conform to arbitrary categories. However, it is important to recognize the range in appearance inherent in the various Bibliography Head KW, et \n\nThe prevalence and distribution of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas vary among species, although they are common in none. In dogs, gastric carcinomas predominate; small intestinal and colonic carcinomas are relatively uncommon. In contrast, gastric carcinoma is almost unknown in cats, but small intestinal and colonic adenocarcinomas are relatively common. In other species, where they are generally rare, gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas also involve mainly small intestine. The microscopic appearance is similar, regardless of species or location.A few develop as tubular and papillary proliferations of differentiated columnar epithelial cells projecting into the intestinal lumen. This is perhaps most commonly seen with colonic carcinomas in cats. Such lesions are distinguished from rare papillary adenomatous hyperplasia because they have at least some invasion into the lamina propria, submucosa, or tunica muscular& Such invasion cannot be appreciated with endoscopic biopsies, and these papillary carcinomas sometimes cannot be distinguished from benign adenomatous hyperplasia or papillary adenomas without full-thickness surgical biopsies.This becomes particularly relevant when trying to distinguish the very common rectal papillary adenoma from the occasional, truly malignant, papillary carcinoma arising in the distal colon or rectum of dogs.\n\nThe earliest recognizable histologic lesion, regardless of the location, is local effacement or obliteration of glandular mucosal architecture at the site of origin by proliferating polygonal mucus-producing epithelial cells. These cells infiltrate the lamina propria, and then invade sequentially through the submucosa and tunica muscularis, infiltrating into lymphatics, and sometimes veins. They penetrate the serosa and exfoliate into the peritoneal cavity to establish neoplastic implants on omentum and mesentery. The tumor also spreads early via lymphatic and venous routes, so that even surgical excision on discovery is rarely curative, because it is too late to prevent metastasis. The microscopic appearance of the invading tumor can be quite variable, and usually more than one histologic subtype occurs within the same neoplasm. There is no proven prognostic or therapeutic significance to the different histologic patterns. Most are scirrhous, mucus-producing carcinomas that can create mucus-filled epithelial lakes throughout the intestinal wall, accompanied by what is often a great deal of fibrous stromal proliferation.The degree of cytologic maturation may be high, yet the diagnosis of carcinoma is obvious, given the transmural invasive behavior. Less commonly, the tumor cells invade in a tubular or acinar pattern, which tends to be less scirrhous, or as scattered individual anaplastic epithelial cells, accompanied by a great deal of desmoplastic fibrous tissue, so that recognizing carcinoma (in contrast to stromal malignancy or postinflammatory reactive fibrosis) may be challenging. In almost all cases, however, the tumor cells produce mucus, which may be revealed by periodic acid-Schiffstaining.\n\nFormation of signet ring cells (an epithelial cell with the nucleus displaced to the periphery by a single large clear cytoplasmic vacuole) is relatively common.\n\nThe histological diagnosis is easy with a full-thickness biopsy.\n\nThe submucosal and transmural portions of the tumor are routinely larger and more readily identified as malignancy than the mucosal portion of the tumor, which endoscopic biopsies may not capture.\n\nAlternatively, especially when large deep ulcerative lesions are biopsied endoscopically, only the necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis that accompany neoplastic cells may be captured. On the other hand, a false-positive diagnosis may be made when attempting to distinguish early carcinoma (especially gastric carcinoma) from dysplastic repair of recent ulceration; in such cases, a full-thickness biopsy to detect invasion is more reliable than the best endoscopic sample.\n\nAdenocarcinoma of the stomach is most frequently reported in dogs, usually in animals < 10 years of age. It is the most common gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma in dogs, and the most common gastric neoplasm in that species. Males predominate in the population with gastric cancer, and over half of gastric adenocarcinomas in dogs occur in the pyloric region. In the Lundehund, there may be a relationship to the chronic gastritis common in that breed, but otherwise no causal association is recognized in dogs.\n\nGrossly, some gastric neoplasms appear as nonulcerating, firm thickenings involving most of the gastric wall and causing loss of the normal rugal pattern on the mucosal surface. Others are more localized plaque-like thickenings that tend to obliterate rugae and ulcerate centrally. Ulceration occurs in over half of canine gastric adenocarcinomas. Surface proliferation or irregularity other than ulceration is very uncommon in gastric carcinoma in dogs. Cut sections through the stomach wall invaded by carcinoma reveal edema and pale, firm fibrous tissue. Induration or plaque-like pale masses may be evident on the serosa, where the pale outline of infiltrated lymphatics may be prominent.Widespread gastric mural fibrosis and thickening, the result of desmoplasia induced by the malignant epithelium, cause \"linitis plastica,\" the so-called \"leather bottle\" appearance.\n\nGastric carcinomas in dogs infiltrate the stomach wall aggressively, invading lymphatics, and they have usually metastasized to the local lymph nodes, and often to distant organs, particularly lung, liver, and adrenal, by the time they are diagnosed.\n\nRare cases of gastric adenocarcinoma are described in eats.They adopt tubular and diffuse patterns, and behave typically, but are so rare that a diagnosis of carcinoma should only be made on a full-thickness surgical biopsy or necropsy specimen. Endoscopic samples suggestive of gastric carcinoma in cats are almost always loci of adenomatous hyperplasia upon further investigation.\n\nGastric adenocarcinoma in cattle is exceptionally uncommon, but when it occurs it resembles similar tumors in other species.\n\nIntestinal adenocarcinomas are uncommon in dogs; they occur most frequently in the proximal small intestine and large bowel of animals averaging 8-9 years old. Some investigators have reported a slightly higher prevalence of intestinal carcinomas in males, with a breed predisposition in Boxers, Collies, Poodles, and German Shepherds.Weight loss, persistent vomiting, anorexia, emaciation, and abdominal distension are the most common signs when the tumor is located in the small intestine. Dogs with colorectal tumors have large-bowel diarrhea, tenesmus, hematochezia, and dyschezia. Many dogs with intestinal carcinomas are anemic on account of hemorrhage from ulcerating tumors.\n\nMacroscopically, the tumors appear as gray-white, firm, sometimes annular, stenotic areas that commonly affect the entire thickness of the intestinal wall (see Fig. 1.48) .These tumors often do not ulcerate, and they usually do not project into the lumen of the gut. Papillary or polypoid intestinal adenocarcinomas do form intraluminal masses, which tend to involve larger segments of the intestine, suggesting horizontal spread.There is dilation of the gut proximal to stenotic and obstructive tumors and there may be hypertrophy of the intestinal muscularis proximal to such neoplasms.\n\nThese tumors metastasize widely, mainly via the lymphatics ( Fig.  1.72) . Involvement of the small intestine leads to metastases mainly in the mesenteric lymph nodes, less commonly to other abdominal nodes, liver, spleen, and lungs. Histological evidence of metastasis at the time of resection of small intestinal tumors predicts a markedly reduced postsurgical survival time, but even dogs without such evidence may succumb to metastatic disease, albeit with longer survival.\n\nColonic adenocarcinomas metastasize to colonic, iliac, and other pelvic and abdominal nodes. Metastases may also occur in most abdominal organs and the lungs. Implantation on serosal surfaces may result in obstruction of omental and diaphragmatic lymphatics, leading to ascites. In a few cases, malignant cells may spread retrograde in the lymphatics of the abdomen and pelvic limbs, causing edema of the abdominal wall and legs.

The etiopathogenesis of colonic carcinomas in dogs is uncertain, but there appears to be progression to malignancy from benign adenomatous lesions in at least some instances. [3-catenin and cyclooxygenase-2 are overexpressed in malignant colonic epithelial cells in some cases, as they are in humans.\n\nIn eats, intestinal adenocarcinoma is less prevalent than lymphosarcoma, but it is relatively more prevalent in cats than in dogs. Carcinomas of the intestine are more prevalent in Siamese cats than in other breeds. As in dogs, a higher prevalence of this tumor has been reported in males than females. The mean age of cats with intestinal carcinomas is 10-11 years.\n\nThe ileum is the most common site affected, followed by the jejunum. Carcinomas occasionally arise in the large intestine, and when the tumor is located at the ileocecal junction, both the large and small intestine are usually involved. The clinical signs and gross appearance are similar to those in dogs.\n\nThe microscopic appearance of intestinal carcinomas in cats is typical ( Fig. 1.73) , except that osteochondroid metaplasia of the stroma may be a feature. The rare carcinomas involving the large intestine have tended to be papillary, better differentiated, and less scirrhous than carcinomas involving the small intestine.\n\nIntestinal adenocarcinoma is relatively common in sheep in New Zealand, the UK, Iceland, Scotland, Norway, and southeastern Australia; in New Zealand and Australia, there is a high prevalence in breeds used for fat lamb production.The cause of the high prevalence is unknown, but may be related to exposure to bracken fern or other unidentified carcinogens. Other associations, such as heavy use of certain fertilizers, and pastures with the weed Cynosaurus cristatus, have been reported from New Zealand. Tumors occur mainly in animals 5 years of age or older. Clinically, affected sheep lose weight and have abdominal distension due to ascites, but most cases are incidental findings at slaughter.\n\nThe tumors are usually located in the middle or lower small intestine, rarely in the colon (Fig. 1.74) .They are dense, firm, white masses, 0.5 to several centimeters long and up to 1 cm thick, which may form annular constrictive bands at the affected site. Cauliflower-like growths may be evident on the serosal surface. Polyps or plaques may protrude into the lumen, but ulceration of the mucosa is uncommon. The distal edge of the tumor is generally well demarcated. There is dilation of the intestine proximal to the lesion. Metastatic implantations on serosal surfaces are common and these appear as opaque to white plaques or diffusely thickened areas, which must be differentiated from mesothelioma. Obstruction of serosal lymphatics by tumor emboli may lead to ascites. Lung and liver metastases are rare.\n\nMicroscopically, the tumor is characterized by solid sheets or nests of well-differentiated to highly anaplastic polyhedral, cuboidal, or columnar epithelial cells that may form irregular acinar structures. They may be distributed singly, or in small aggregates, and are often difficult to detect in the heavy fibrous desmoplastic response ( Fig.  1.75) .The neoplastic cells infiltrate the bowel wall along lymphatics, vessels, and nerve trunks, through to the serosal surface, whence they spread to the mesenteric lymph nodes. This is apparently followed by retrograde lymphogenous metastasis to the gut wall proximal to the primary tumor. These secondary tumors are particularly responsible for constriction of the gut lumen. Sclerotic masses with anaplastic epithelial cells, many of which are periodic acid-Schiff-positive, are located on the serosal surfaces of the abdominal organs but rarely infiltrate the parenchyma.Argentaffin cells may form part of some intestinal carcinomas, especially in lymph node metastases. Mineralization and osseous metaplasia may develop in the stroma.\n\nIntestinal carcinomas are generally rare in cattle, goats, horses, and swine ( Fig. 1.76) , with the exception of those associated with bracken fern, papillomavirus, and upper alimentary cancer in cattle (see section on Neoplasia of the esophagus and forestomachs, above).\n\nA high prevalence of intestinal adenomas is associated with these tumors in catde.Three types are recognized: (1) a sessile plaque; (2) an adenomatous polyp; and (3) a more proliferative adenoma of the ampullae where the bile and pancreatic ducts open into the duodenum. Intestinal carcinomas are usually an incidental finding at meat inspection. The location, morphology, and routes of metastasis are similar to those described for sheep, except that serosal lesions are less obvious. Hematogenous spread to the liver, lung, kidney, uterus, and ovaries may occur in cattle. \n\nAdenomatous hyperplasia occurs as focal papillary or papillotubular proliferation of surface epithelium anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. In the stomach (Fig. 1.77) , it is to be distinguished from chronic hypertrophic pyloric gastropathy, discussed with pyloric obstruction.\n\nThe most common site is the distal rectum of middle-aged dogs, within 10 cm of the anal-rectal margin. Given a variety of names, such as adenomatous hyperplasia, papillotubular adenoma, colorectal polyp, or adenoma, and polypoid carcinoma in situ, we refer to it as rectal papillary adenoma. It occurs in dogs of almost any age, and is usually a single nodule easily managed by adequate surgical excision.Tenesmus, prolapse of the polyp, rectal bleeding following defecation, chronic dyschezia, and diarrhea are the most common signs. There is a single case ofparaneoplastic leukocytosis associated with such a tumor. Some, but not all, surveys indicate that this tumor is more common in males.\n\nMacroscopically, the tumor is usually sessile or slightly pedunculated ( Fig. 1.78) , varying from 1 cm to several centimeters in diameter. It may be firm or friable and hemorrhagic; the mucosal surface is often ulcerated.\n\nMicroscopically, the polyp may have a predominantly tubular or papillary growth pattern ( Fig. 1.79) . In well-oriented specimens, the tubular pattern is characterized by branching crypts that are lined by generally well-differentiated columnar-to-cuboidal pseudostratified epithelial cells. The papillary type consists of villus-like projections of proprial connective tissue that are covered by a layer of pseudostratifled columnar epithelial cells. There may be cytoplasmic basophilia, loss of nuclear polarity, and prominent nucleoli in epithelium in both types of polyps.The number of mitotic figures varies, often within the same polyp. These tumors often appear to originate in the superficial portion of the crypts, deeper portions of which may remain normal, with tubules or slender papillae of hyperchromatic tumor cells above them.The stalk of the tumor is highly vascular and is continuous with the lamina propria or submucosa of the rectum.The tumors are generally well demarcated from the adjacent normal mucosa.The amount of mucin in the epithelium varies considerably, and it is often absent, especially in more dysplastic cells. Some polyps have a malignant appearance histologically. These are characterized by the presence of anaplastic epithelial cells in situ in the mucosa, and, in some cases, invading the propria and adjacent submucosa (Fig. 1.80) . There is limited information on the biological behavior of these tumors. In dogs, adequate surgical removal usually results in complete recovery. Some are interpreted at presentation as carcinoma in situ, based on cytologic characteristics, and deep biopsies and/or complete excision of these polyps are essential to rule out local invasion or infiltration of lymphatics, which should be sought in specimens with epithelial morphology suggesting malignancy. Polyps that are more than 1 cm in diameter tend to have cells with a more anaplastic appearance, and recurrence is most probable in cases interpreted as carcinoma in situ, those with multiple masses, or those with more diffuse colonic involvement.\n\nIn other species, polypoid and adenomatous tumors are uncommon. Benign adenomatous polyps are reported in the stomach and duodenum of cats, predominantly middle-aged males of Asian breeds. They are presented with vomition, hematemesis, and possibly anemia. Excision is curative.These lesions can be confused with papillary adenocarcinomas if sampled only by endoscopic biopsy.\n\nIn cattle, intestinal polyps are usually an incidental finding, except in those cases where they are large enough to cause partial obstruction. The tumors are raised, often pedunculated, gray-to-brown masses on the mucosal surface. They may occur singly, in grape-like clusters, or they may be scattered. Microscopically they resemble benign rectal polyps in the dog, but they may be capable of malignant transformation (see above).\n\nAdenomatous polyps Frequently occur in sheep with intestinal carcinoma. Hyperplastic polyps occur in the small intestines of lambs and goats with chronic coccidiosis (see section on Infectious and parasitic diseases of the alimentary tract, later in this chapter).\n\nMulticentric small intestinal polyposis has been associated with protein-losing enteropathy in a horse. The proliferative lesions\n\nCarcinoids arise from neuroendocrine cells that are scattered in the mucosa of a wide variety of organs, including the stomach and the intestine.These cells secrete low-molecular-weight polypeptide hormones such as secretin, somatostatin and cholecystokinin, or they are part of the amine precursor uptake decarboxylation (APUD) group, producing compounds such as serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine).\n\nCarcinoid tumors of the gastrointestinal tract are rare in domestic animals.They have been reported mainly in aged dogs and very rarely in the cat, cow, and horse. In dogs, most carcinoids are located in the duodenum, colon, and rectum, and only rarely in the stomach and lower small intestine. Clinically, they may cause intestinal obstruction, and anemia due to ulceration and hemorrhage.Associated diarrhea in some cases can speculatively be attributed to hypersecretion of functional polypeptide hormones. Rectal carcinoids may protrude from the anus and resemble adenomatous polyps.\n\nMacroscopically, carcinoids are usually lobulated, firm, dark-red to cream-colored masses a few millimeters to perhaps 2 cm in diameter. They seem to arise deep in the mucosa, often forming submucosal or subserosal nodules, perhaps with ulceration of overlying mucosa, and infiltrating transmurally and into the mesentery.\n\nMicroscopically, carcinoids have a distinct endocrine appearance. Round or oval to polyhedral cells have abundant finely granular eosinophilic or vacuolated cytoplasm and vesiculate nuclei with prominent nucleoli. They form nests, ribbons, rosettes, or diffuse sheets in the mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis.A fine vascularized fibrous stroma often divides the tumor masses into pseudoalveolar arrays. Amyloid may be present in intercellular and perivascular spaces. Uninuclear megalocytes and multinucleate giant cells are present occasionally.\n\nA diagnosis of carcinoid is based on the endocrine histologic pattern, cytoplasmic argentaf~nic and argyrophilic granularity, immunohistochemical identification of specific secretory products, and the typical ultrastructural appearance. The histochemical reactions may be negative, especially in rectal carcinoids, and they may also be lost during fixation in formalin or by autolysis prior to fixation, as may immunohistochemical reactivity. These cells are routinely positive with immunohistochemical staining for neuron-specific enolase and chromogranin, as are most neuroendocrine tumors, and then with one or more of the specific immune probes related to the peptides being produced. An increased concentration of specific secretory products may be detected in circulation.\n\nElectron microscopic examination helps to differentiate carcinoids from intestinal mast cell tumors. Carcinoid cells have dense, round-to-oval, membrane-bound secretory granules in the cytoplasm, which vary in diameter from 75 to 300 nm.They have abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane forms interdigitating processes. Carcinoid cells are Schiff-negative and do not show metachromasia with Giemsa stains.\n\nData on biological behavior of intestinal carcinoids in dogs are limited. Most cases reported have been malignant. There may be extensive invasion of the gut wall and veins, with metastasis, especially to the liver. The few cases that have been described in other species have features similar to those described in dogs.\n\nGoblet-cell carcinoids (adenocarcinoids, mucinous carcinoids) are tumors that are most commonly found in the appendix of humans, with features of both carcinoids and adenocarcinomas. There is a single report of such a tumor in the rectum of a dog. Microscopically, goblet-cell carcinoids have distinct areas of mucinous adenocarcinoma and carcinoid that may merge. The carcinoid component is most prominent in the primary tumor and the metastases.\n\nSquamous cell carcinomas derived from the mucosa of the pars esophagea are the most common gastric tumor in horses. They occur predominantly in middle-aged or older animals, which are usually presented in an advanced state, with unexplained anorexia, occasionally dysphagia, and weight loss sometimes progressing rapidly to emaciation.At autopsy there may be peritoneal effusion, and there is usually evidence of the neoplasm as plaques of proliferative or scirrhous tissue on the serosa of the stomach. There may also be peritoneal implants, especially on intestine, testes, omentum, parietal abdominal surfaces and diaphragm; direct extension to adjacent organs including liver, spleen, and diaphragm, with progression to the pleural space; and sometimes distant metastases, usually in liver and lung. The appearance of the tumor on serosal surfaces resembles mesothelioma, with smooth creamy plaques or nodules up to 2-4 cm in diameter. The origin of these lesions is usually a fungating cauliflower-like mass 10-40 cm in diameter, with superficial fissures, projecting above the surface of the pars esophagea ( Fig. 1.81 ). Sometimes these lesions are superficially more ulcerative than proliferative. Necrosis and hemorrhage are evident in the tumor mass, which is usually well demarcated from adjacent normal squamous mucosa. Occasionally the tumor extends into the distal esophagus, and may obstruct it. Microscopically, these neoplasms are typical squamous cell carcinomas, invading in cords or nests of cells through the gastric wall. They induce desmoplasia, imparting a scirrhous, firm texture and appearance to the thickened gastric wall and to the peritoneal and pleural implants. One such tumor has been reported as a cause ofpseudohyperparathyroidism in a horse.\n\nA squamous cell carcinoma is reported arising from the pyloric gland mucosa in a dog. \n\nGastrointestinal lymphomas occur in most species and are common in cats. These neoplasms may be primary, or part of the systemic or multicentric form of the neoplasm (see Vol. 3, Hematopoietic system). Primary lymphoma of the intestine includes cases having malignant lymphocytic infiltrates in the intestine, with or without involvement of the abdominal organs or bone marrow, but with no lesions in the thorax or peripheral sites.\n\nMalignant lymphoma is the most common gastrointestinal neoplasm in companion animals, more prevalent in cats than in dogs.\n\nIt can be segmental within any portion of the gastrointestinal tract, or diffuse. While the gastrointestinal tract may be involved in advanced multicentric lymphoma in dogs, such cases are rarely submitted for biopsy because the diagnosis has already been made based on lesions elsewhere. Most samples submitted for histologic assessment are from cases suspected of having primary gastrointestinal lymphoma. In cats, almost all cases examined at biopsy are primary within the stomach or intestine.\n\nIn both species, spread outside intestine is usually to mesenteric lymph nodes and to liver, and less commonly beyond. In liver, the neoplasm infiltrates in a characteristic portal pattern that should not be mistaken for chronic portal hepatitis or lymphocytic cholangiohepatitis. In lymphoma, the tumor cells often form layers 10-20 deep in the portal tract, and cholangiolar proliferation, fibrosis, and hepatocellular atrophy are absent. In advanced hepatic disease, the cells will also surround central veins.Although scattered tumor cells may occur within the sinusoids, a primarily sinusoidal distribution of lymphocytes signals lymphocytic leukemia rather than intestinal lymphoma.\n\nThe classification oflymphomas in animals is complex, integrafng distribution, histologic and cytologic appearance, and immunophenotype. Most categories are based on lymphomas discovered in lymph nodes or skin; as a group, intestinal lymphomas have received little detailed investigation in this context. Most of the controversy about intestinal lymphoma is related not to its diagnosis, but rather to the relationship (if any) between its classification and subsequent behavior, including response to therapy; currently no clear association is evident.\n\nIn dogs, intestinal lymphoma can affect animals from adolescence to old age, with a male sex bias. Nonspecific signs of enteric disease and weight loss may be acute or occur over a period of weeks to months. Hypoproteinemia, probably associated with enteric protein loss, occurs in \"-'30% of affected dogs.\n\nThe tumors are located in the small intestine, stomach, and colon in that order of frequency. They are soft-to-firm, cream-colored masses located in the submucosa that may protrude into the gut lumen. The overlying mucosa may be ulcerated. The masses can be nodular to diffuse and several sections of the gut are usually affected. The mesenteric nodes are often enlarged and the liver is frequently involved at the time of presentation.\n\nThe majority of primary gastrointestinal lymphomas in dogs are epitheliotropic T-cell tumors based on immunohistochemical reactions, the remainder being mixed, B-cell, or indeterminate. Microscopically, in typical cases of epitheliotropic intestinal lymphoma, the mucosal, submucosal, and muscular architecture is effaced by a population of monotypic large lymphocytes with variable nuclear morphology and obvious mitotic activity. The crypts literally \"disappear\" as they become infiltrated by neoplastic cells.\n\nThe lesions of very early lymphoma are more challenging. They are distinguished from chronic inflammatory bowel disease by the relatively monotypic lymphocyte population and by the intraepithelial infiltration of lymphocytes that obscures the distinction between lamina propria and epithelium. Even with these criteria, differentiation of early neoplastic from inflammatory disease can be problematic, since residual plasma cells, eosinophils, and benign lymphocytes of the normal lamina propria persist among the neoplastic lymphocyte population. Similarly, not all cases of intestinal lymphoma exhibit epitheliotropic growth, and there is overlap between neoplastic epithelial invasion and the increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes that is commonly seen with inflammatory disease. The key is not just the presence of the lymphocytes, but the obliteration of the proprial:epithelial boundary. Once the lymphoma effaces crypts or invades submucosa, diagnosis should not be problematic, but full-thickness biopsies from several areas of the intestine may help differentiate chronic inflammatory bowel disease from intestinal lymphoma.\n\nLymphoplasmacytic enteritis in the dog, particularly the Basenji, may represent a prelymphomatous stage similar to immunoproliferative small intestinal disease in humans.The latter is characterized by diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltration of the small intestinal mucosa that results in malabsorption, and predisposes to the development of primary enteromesenteric lymphoma.\n\nIn cats, the situation is substantially more complicated. There are at least three histologic categories of gastrointestinal lymphoma. However, no correlation is evident between immunophenotype and ultimate biological behavior or response to treatment. It is also fairly common in cats to have sharply segmental disease, and some such cases can be cured by surgical excision.\n\nSmall-cell lymphocytic villus lymphoma is an epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma that typically begins at the base of the villi within the small intestine of old cats. Clustering of suspiciously monotypic small hyperchromatic lymphocytes within the lamina propria just at the base of villi is an exceedingly common observation in cats 15 years of age and older. It is not clear whether this is incipient lymphoma or a normal finding. The number of such cells may vary substantially from villus to villus.As these clusters seem to expand, the lymphocytes infiltrate into the overlying epithelium, obliterating the distinction between lamina propria and epithelium. Unlike inflammatory bowel disease, such lesions may be very patchy, and there is no concurrent increase in plasma cells or eosinophils. With time, the lymphocyte population appears to expand throughout the lamina propria and then transmurally. The syndrome shares substantial clinical overlap with inflammatory bowel disease in that it is often slowly progressive and it is usually not accompanied by clinical signs related to neoplastic infiltration of liver, spleen, or lymph node, even though there is often microscopic tumor within those organs.The extent of microscopic disease within the intestine is usually much greater than the macroscopic impression at the time of surgery.\n\nLarge-cell/lymphoblastic lymphoma, in contrast, is characterized by a rapidly progressing transmural lesion that is usually accompanied by clinically palpable intestinal masses and by markedly enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. Cats of any age may be affected. Most of these are reported as B-cell tumors, although not all investigators concur, and the majority of these high-grade lymphomas have not been subjected to immunophenotyping.The tumor resembles canine lymphomas, in that there is usually transmural effacement of intestinal architecture, and obliteration of the structure of affected mesenteric lymph nodes. Many cases differ from canine lymphomas, however, in having marked cellular pleomorphism. The tumor cells may have fairly abundant cytoplasm, nuclear cleavage, and up to twofold anisokaryosis. Descriptive names like \"histiocytic\" lymphoma for some of these more anaplastic variants are no longer appropriate, since immunophenotyping is available to identify the cells more precisely. Lesions are often sharply segmental and the primary lesion can be completely excised. However, the high prevalence of metastatic disease makes surgical cures rare.\n\nLarge granular lymphoma is usually a rapidly progressive intestinal lymphoma of cats. The tumor cells are either T cells or natural killer cells. These are medium-to-large lymphocytes with pleomorphic nuclei with frequent clefting.The distinctive features are the large red cytoplasmic granules, and perforin immunoreactivity. In the presence of cleaved nuclei, the large granules may be mistaken for those of eosinophils, but they are larger, rounder, and are more intensely eosinophilic. The cytologic characteristics have also caused such tumors to be attributed to globule leukocytes in the past. The granular cells are not present as a pure population. They are often intermingled with other lymphocyte types and with macrophages, so these invasive and destructive transmural lesions are sometimes confused with transmural granulomatous disease or mast cell tumors. These tumors progress rapidly, with widespread dissemination and even leukemia, and they may perforate affected areas of intestine.\n\nIn the horse, alimentary lymphoma is a relatively common tumor; most are attributed to B lymphocytes. It occurs mainly in young adults. Affected horses lose condition, likely due to malabsorption and protein loss; in addition they may be anemic, icteric, and have mild intermittent bouts of colic. Diarrhea is inconsistent. Serum albumin can often be decreased, but they are frequently hypergammaglobulinemic.\n\nMacroscopic lesions in horses are usually located in the small intestine, and these are characterized by local to diffuse thickening of the gut wall with prominent rugae on the mucosa. Nodules or plaques with fibrous adhesions may be evident on the serosa. The mesenteric nodes are markedly enlarged. Other nodes may be enlarged, but to a lesser extent. Microscopically, there is diffuse lymphoid infiltration of the lamina propria and submucosa, usually extending transmurally to the serosa.There is marked villus atrophy to the point of complete loss of villi and crypts. Plasmacytoid cells are regularly present in the lamina propria but less numerous in the submucosa. Similar lymphoid cell infiltration involves the mesenteric nodes and the perinodal connective tissue. Other lymph nodes are involved in about half the cases.A plasmacytoid or plasmacytic reaction and occasional giant cells are also present in the nodes. The neoplastic lymphoid cells are probably of B-cell origin and \"home\" into the gut-associated lymphoid tissue and the lamina propria of the small intestine.\n\nAn immune-mediated type of dermatitis has been associated with both chronic inflammatory (granulomatous and eosinophilic enteritides) and lymphomatous lesions in the gut in horses.\n\nEpitheliotropic T-cell lymphomas resembling those in dogs, and ulcerating large granular lymphomas caused by T cells, somewhat resembling those described in cats, also occur infrequently in horses. A T-cell lymphoma occurred concurrently with multisystemic eosinophilic epitheliotropic disease in a horse, prompting the suggestion that undetected T-cell lymphoma secreting interleukin-5 may underlie that syndrome. Paraneoplastic eosinophilia has also been associated with intestinal lymphosarcoma in the horse.\n\nIn cattle and sheep, alimentary lymphomas are generally part of the adult multicentric form of the disease, and the intestinal lesions resemble the effacing tumors described in other species. More important in cattle is lymphosarcoma of the abomasum, which is common in adult cattle. Diffuse mucosal and submucosal lymphocytic infiltrates or nodular proliferations may occur. Strategically placed pyloric tumor may cause obstruction. Diffuse lesions, thickening the gastric wall, frequently ulcerate, and hemorrhage from such ulcers, as melena, is a common sign. The lymphoid infiltrates are recognizable as firm gray-white tissue in the submucosa and mucosa. Involvement of abomasal lymph nodes is disproportionately slight.\n\nIn swine, diffuse gastric lymphosarcoma occurs. The wall of the stomach is thickened by submucosal lymphocytic infiltrates, which sometimes invade the mucosa locally in many areas, producing nodular elevations that may ulcerate. B-cell lymphomas involving the Peyer's patches have also been detected at meat inspection in swine.\n\nThese tumors are uncommon.They occur in aged dogs, and occasionally in cats, with signs such as vomition, diarrhea, and melena. They are seen in biopsies as invasive round cell tumors that can resemble carcinoids, lymphomas, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors; definitive diagnosis requires histochemical and possibly immunohistochemical investigations. Primary mast cell tumors of the gastrointestinal tract are comprised ofmucosal mast cells, which differ from connective tissue mast cells, such as those found in skin, in having few granules, which usually do not stain well in formalin-fixed tissue.Abnormal mast cells do not appear in circulation in animals with these tumors.\n\nMast cell tumors are most commonly seen in stomach, and least common in the colon. Affected areas in the mucosa are tan-colored, firm, thickened, possibly ulcerated, and may be 1 cm to several centimeters in size. The tissue architecture is effaced by a population of granular round cells accompanied by variable numbers of eosinophils. They generally grow in infiltrative cords, but occasionally form endocrine-like packets surrounded by a delicate fibrovascular stroma. There is a wide range in the cytologic appearance. Some tumors are populated by fairly mature mast cells with abundant cytoplasmic granularity easily demonstrated with toluidine blue. Others are populated by anaplastic and pleomorphic round cells or spindle-shaped cells, sometimes with giant nuclei or forming syncytia, in which cytoplasmic granules with metachromatic staining, while present, may be difficult to observe. Those with abundant metachromatic granules must be differentiated from connective tissue mast cell tumors metastatic to the gastrointestinal tract, in which case lesions should be sought in skin and elsewhere. There can be marked variation in the number of eosinophils in the tumor, and they are not definitive, since eosinophils are also common in some intestinal lymphomas, and as part of the background cell population in normal lamina propria.\n\nGastrointestinal mucosal mast cell tumors are differentiated using a suite of histochemical and immunohistochemical characteristics.\n\nThey have at least a few metachromatic granules when stained with toluidine blue, and many tumors have at least some cells that stain with alcian blue.They stain immunohistochemically positive for mast cell tryptase and c-KIT (CD117), but negatively for CD3 (distinguishing them from most T-cell lymphomas), cytokeratin (distinguishing them from carcinomas), and chromogranin and synaptophysin (distinguishing them from carcinoids). Gastrointestinal stromal tumors should be positive for c-KIT, but cytology and lack of metachromatic granules when stained with toluidine blue differentiate them.\n\nUltrastructurally, the cytoplasm of gastrointestinal mucosal mast cell tumor cells contains many membrane-bound granules that appear as single or fused vesicles. Fine fibrillar material forms a loose network within these vesicles.A few tumor cells contain electron-dense fibrillar granules or intermediate forms.The crystalline electron-dense granules that are present in connective tissue mast cells, such as those from the skin, are rarely evident.\n\nMetastases occur most often in the mesenteric lymph nodes, followed by the liver, spleen, and, rarely, the lungs. Ulceration of the gastrointestinal mucosa occurs commonly with systemic tissue mast cell tumors in cats and with large cutaneous mastocytomas in dogs, due to histamine stimulation of acid production by gastric parietal cells. Gastrointestinal ulceration is not a feature ofmucosal mast cell tumors of intestinal origin, except perhaps as a result of mucosal effacement by the tumor. \n\nPlasmacytomas of the lower gastrointestinal tract are uncommon neoplasms in dogs, and rare in cats and other species.They are encountered most frequently in the submucosa of the distal colon and rectum of dogs, where they are associated with signs of large-bowel diarrhea and bleeding. Histologically, they resemble plasmacytomas of the skin, oral cavity, or larynx. The tumor is formed by solid packets of pleomorphic round cells with various degrees of plasmacytoid maturation, especially at the periphery of the tumor. There is frequent nuclear hyperchromasia and convolution.The cells are typically arranged in solid endocrine-like packets of 10-20 cells surrounded by a delicate fibrovascular stroma, and there may be AL amyloid deposition among the tumor ceHs.A few syncytial plasmacytoid or histiocytic cells may be evident. The majority of the tumor growth is submucosal, with a little bit of overflow into the deep half of the lamina propria. Most tumors have a discrete local growth habit amenable to surgical cure.A small proportion exhibit more aggressive behavior, including invasion of tunica muscularis, and some spread to regional lymph nodes and spleen, perhaps producing a monoclonal gammopathy. \n\nThe intestinal stromal tumors include leiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and very uncommon examples of almost every other type of stromal neoplasm, including hemangiosarcoma, nerve sheath tumors, fibroma and fibrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and even lipoma. Ganglioneuromas have been described in dogs, a sow, horse, and a kitten. Other mesenchymal tumors include fibrous histiocytoma in a cow and histiocytic sarcoma in a dog.\n\nLeiomyoma, leiomyosarcoma, and gastrointestinal stroreal tumor are considered together, since recognition of the latter prompted re-evaluation of the criteria for diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma; older literature should be read with this in mind. Together, they are more common in dogs than other types of mesenchymal tumors except lymphosarcoma, and they also occur with some frequency in horses. Smooth-muscle tumors occur uncommonly in cats, equally prevalent in stomach, small intestine, and colon. They occur only rarely, if at all, in other species.\n\nLeiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma represent the two extremes of a morphologic continuum, which included, toward the malignant end of the spectrum, tumors now classified as gastrointestinal stromal tumor.The latter are thought to be derived from interstitial cells of Cajal, or from a stem cell precursor to both those cells and smooth-muscle cells, and they are distinguished by expressing KIT (CD117) antigen. While some may contain smooth-muscle actin, they rarely express desmin. Leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas, on the other hand, do not express KIT, and should express smoothmuscle actin, and desmin. Immunohistochemical reactivity is the definitive means of differentiating these tumors, but may be adversely affected by autolysis and duration of fixation, which must be considered in such studies. However, leiomyomas can be recognized based on their histology and cytology.\n\nIn dogs, as a group these tumors occur in older animals, in many of which they may be asymptomatic and incidental. Signs can include weight loss, lethargy, anorexia, anemia due to intestinal hemorrhage, abdominal pain, palpable abdominal masses, diarrhea, vomition, and dehydration or other signs of gastrointestinal obstruction. Based on limited studies in which the immunophenotype of stromal tumors of the gut has been determined, leiomyomas are most cormnon and tend to occur in the esophagus and stomach of predominantly male dogs. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are the next most common, and may occur in the stomach and intestine, with a tendency to predominate in the large bowel; sex distribution is equal. They have a spectrum of behavior from benign to malignant, and include tumors that were diagnosed as leiomyosarcomas prior to revision of terminology. Leiomyosarcomas are seemingly least common, and tend to occur in the intestine, with no apparent sex predisposition.\n\nThe majority of symptomatic tumors of this type are expansile nodules arising in the muscularis externa and can be cured by surgical excision, as is certainly the case with leiomyoma. However, a minority, perhaps up to 30%, of the other types have metastasized by the time that they are discovered.\n\nLeiomyomas are sharply circumscribed masses of well-differentiated smooth-muscle cells, and generally lie beneath an intact mucosa, although they may deform the serosal or mucosal profile, and ulceration, perhaps related to pressure necrosis, can occur.They are comprised of swirling bundles of uniform fusiform cells, with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, and a central nucleus with blunt ends; usually no mitotic figures are evident.Areas of coagulative necrosis may occur in the tumor mass.\n\nLeiomyosarcomas often resemble leiomyomas grossly, but they are invasive rather than circumscribed, and may ulcerate mucosa. The cells resemble those in leiomyomas in general cytology, but there is usually some degree of anisokaryosis, multiple nucleoli, scattered bizarre nuclei, and obvious mitotic activity. There may be necrosis in the mass and a mild lymphocytic or eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate.\n\nGastrointestinal stromal tumors may be demarcated and grow by expansion, sometimes forming exophytic nodules on the serosal surface, or they may be transmural and invasive. Overlying mucosa, while usually intact, may ulcerate.They are usually comprised of spindle cells arranged as interlacing fascicles, or in a storiform (whorling or matted) pattern, with oval nuclei, and a somewhat basophilic cytoplasm with indistinct boundaries.A minority of cases may have somewhat epithelioid tumor cells arranged in trabeculae or solid sheets, perhaps with a somewhat myxoid intercellular matrix, often infiltrating between normal smooth-muscle fascicles. Epithelioid tumors are thought to reflect some degree of neural differentiation, while a storiform pattern is considered to reflect a poor degree of differentiation. There may be nuclear pleomorphism in all patterns of tumor, and mitotic figures are usually evident, and may be common. Hemorrhage or necrosis may be present within the tumor, and lymphocytic and/or eosinophilic infiltrates can occur.\n\nThe difficulty in determining the prognosis of these tumors in dogs has not changed with the recognition that the great majority are gastrointestinal stromal tumors, rather than leiomyosarcomas. No objective criteria or nomenclature differentiate benign from malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In humans, larger tumor size and high mitotic activity are considered to be poor prognostic indicators, but there are no data substantiating these tendencies in animals.\n\nInvasion into the mucosa causes ulceration and cavitation on the luminal surface ( Fig. 1.82) , which may lead to perforation of the Approach to the diagnosis of gastrointestinat disease bowel. Even in the absence of perforation, microorganisms from the gut lumen may cause local abscessation and secondary septic peritonitis in which there is intermingling of suppuration, granulation tissue, and tumor cells. Based on studies carried out prior to revision of the nomenclature, tumors in cecum and colon, where gastrointestinal stromal tumors predominate, were determined to have a relatively high metastatic risk. They may metastasize to the mesenteric nodes, mesentery, and liver, but in general, these tumors have a more favorable prognosis after complete resection than other malignant neoplasms of the lower gastrointestinal tract.\n\nThe large intestinal tumors may also cause paraneoplastic hypoglycemia, due to the production of insulin-like growth factors, that may precipitate the search for a neoplasm. Production of erythropoietin, resulting in erythrocytosis, has also been documented.\n\nIn old horses, tumors of the intestine have been described that in many cases meet morphologic or immunohistochemical criteria for gastrointestinal stromal tumor, as it has been described above. Most are encountered incidentally, at surgery, meat inspection, or necropsy, but tumors of this type, or previously diagnosed as leiomyomas, may cause intermittent bouts of colic that become more frequent with time. They occur in the stomach, small intestine, and most frequently in the cecum and colon, as encapsulated, moderately firm, multinodular, pale tan, or hemorrhagic masses in the muscularis or subserosa, protruding on the serosal surface, or rarely, as somewhat pedunculated tumors projecting from the serosa or into the lumen. They may vary from 1 to > 10 cm in diameter, and are usually solitary, but occasionally may be multiple. Malignancy, if it occurs, must be rare; it is not described."}
