{"title": "The effects of border control and quarantine measures on global spread of COVID-19", "body": "Meta-population model 59 Assuming the newly emergence of COVID-19 causes an outbreak at location i, during the emergence, the 60 changes of the numbers of infectious cases I j at a different location j can be determined using a simple 61 Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered (SIR) meta-population model with a mobility matrix (contact mixing at 62 the population level):\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the baseline transmission rate that can be estimated from R 0 Tg , R 0 is the basic reproductive number, T g 65 is the generation time, M ii is the human mobility rate within the source location i, M ji is the mobility rate from 66 i to j, and I j is the number of infected individuals at the location j. Our aim was to develop a meta-population is higher up to 1, the mobility rate is reduced to zero. The infected cases were quarantined on average T qr days 72 after they are transmitted. After derivation (steps are described in later sections), the final model became:\n\nwhere Imp and Sec represent the imported and secondary cases produced by the imported cases (we will use 77 secondary cases to denote this group in the remaining parts). We introduced an \u03b7(k, .) function to map the 78 number of the infected at the source i to the imported and secondary cases at j given different border control 79 5 and quarantine measures. The term \u03b7(k = 0, .) calculated the changes during first wave transmission (imported) 80 and \u03b7(k = 1, .) calculated the changes during second wave transmission (secondary infected cases produced by 81 the imported cases) under quarantine. The dot in \u03b7(k = 0, .) represents other epidemiological parameters. 82 During the early outbreak phase, because the susceptible population S was so close to the population size N , 83 therefore, we assumed S N \u2248 1. Because M ii and M jj are both near one (every day, more than 99.99% of 84 individuals stay in the same location), we thus ignored the variables M ii and M jj to increase readability in the 85 remaining sections. 86 Calculating the arrival rate of imported cases 87 In order to calculate the imported cases, we assumed that infected cases could pass the border screening or 88 move to another location only during their latent or incubation periods. We calculated the number of latent 89 cases at time s by including a latent period \u03c4 . Therefore, the number of cases I i in Eq(1) that were within the 90 latent period at a specific time s were\n\nis the cumulative distribution function of latent cases that were transmitted a days ago but before recovery. The 92 longer a latent period was, the more total imported cases were produced in a given duration. After replacing the 93 number of infected cases by the latent cases, we obtained the rate of imported cases:\n\nwhere \u039b is the growth rate and can be calculated as \u039b = R 0 \u22121 Tg . If all the infected cases can move to a different 95 place as the latent period \u03c4 is quite long enough, the formula is reduced to (1 \u2212 c)M ji I(t).\n\nCalculating numbers of imported and secondary cases\n\nTo calculate the number imported (Imp) and secondary cases (Sec), we had the following formulas now:\n\nwhere T qr is the time to quarantine. The number of cumulative imported cases can thus be derived during a 100 certain period of time when the incidence is still exponentially increasing at the source location. Assuming 101 6 .

Because of dI i dt \u2248 \u039bI i , we 105 have the infected number at i as a function of time t, that is I i (t) = I 0 e \u039bt . If we set \u03b2 = R 0 Tg , we obtained the 106 infectious disease spreading control function given k transmission waves before the community transmission:\n\nThe formula was simplified after we replaced \u039b + 1 Tg by R0 Tg . Under this notation, secondary infection cases can 108 simply be calculated as \u03b7(k = 2, . . . ) multiplied by the (1 \u2212 c)M ji I 0 e \u039bt :\n\n109\n\n110\n\nConsequently, the cumulative number of imported and secondary cases at time t under latent period were:\n\nBecause before the outbreak occurred (or before community spread) at a location j, infections only happened 113 when transmission events occurred between the imported cases and the susceptible individuals at j (we call it 114 the second wave of transmission), it is essential to estimate the cumulative number of the imported cases 115 (CI Imp ; the first wave of transmission) and the cumulative secondary cases transmitted from those imported 116 cases (CI Sec ; the second wave of transmission). We were able to deduce tertiary cases but the number will be 117 7 .

This framework provides a more 121 generalized expression to estimate the cumulative imported cases (first wave of transmission) and the 122 cumulative secondary infected cases generated by the imported cases (second wave of transmission) at 123 connected cities or locations during a certain period of time when the incidence is exponentially increasing at 124 the source.\n\nConstructing contact matrix 126 Airline passenger data were collected from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) database. We 127 collected the actual passenger data for top 10 visiting cities leaving from Wuhan Tianhe International Airport 128 before the lockdown of Wuhan city from 30 December to 20 January, 2020. Note that we did not have data for 129 railroad and other forms of transport, and thus made an assumption that the total number of travelers is 4 times 130 higher than that of air transport except for certain cities on Hainan island that have no road connections to 131 Wuhan. We made this assumption because that the number of train passengers is few times higher than that of 132 airline in China [15] and the results from a population migration database suggested a similar ratio [16] . The 133 number of daily passengers between different cities were used to generate the mobility rate M ji between 134 locations i and j. For example, we divided a daily passenger number by total population size in Wuhan to 135 represent the contact rate between Wuhan city and any other connected city j. We denote i = 0 as the index for 136 the source city. Therefore, M 00 = 1 is the base level of contact rate within the source city. j is a number to 137 represent the index of the top visiting cities from first to last following the order in the list. Because the 138 estimated number of people leaving from Wuhan to the first visiting city (Beijing) is 10793.5 per day, given that 139 the population size of Wuhan is about 11 million, the daily percentage of people leaving to the 1st visiting city 140 can be approximated to 0.001. Thus, we have M 10 = 0.001. We used the same approach to determine M j0 for 141 j = 2, 3, . . . , 10.\n\nDetermining outbreak potential 143 Next we considered the outbreak potential, defined as the probability of outbreak emergence given the number 144 of cumulative cases. At the initial stage, if there were n infected individuals, the chance of the viruses to cause 145 an outbreak is p j,n = 1 \u2212 1 R n j ini [17] . We determined a critical threshold number \u03bd to be 8 and set p j,\u03bd = 50% 146 8 .

We thus obtained the effective 148 reproductive number R j ini = 1.0905 to represent the transmissibility during the second wave of transmission 149 at location j. Note that this number represents the epidemic growth under control measures before community 150 spread. R j ini indicates the average number of transmissions that are generated from the secondary cases (Sec) 151 before the community spread. Because the nation-wide alert has already been received at different cities after 152 31 December, 2019, and many infectious disease control measures have been implemented, R j ini was 153 expected to be lower than R 0 . Given the R j ini number, we used the cumulative number of secondary cases 154 CI Sec at the location j to calculate the probability of outbreak emergence as p j,\n\n(to simplify the 155 notation, the CI j is used to represent CI Sec ). We defined the critical arrival time such that the probability of 156 outbreak emergence p j,CI j was larger than 50%. \n\nModel of outbreak spreading 159 The cities that most Wuhan citizens moved to in the first month after the outbreak of the COVID-19 was were extracted with the 1779.9 persons on average ( Figure 1A) . We estimated the total passengers leaving out 164 from Wuhan using a human migration map airline passengers. We obtained the estimated numbers of total 165 passengers given the proportion of airline passenger was about 23% of all transportation in early January [16] . 166 An increasing number of the confirmed cases was observed among the top visiting cities, including Beijing, 167 Shanghai, and Guangzhou ( Figure 1B ).\n\nThe community spread began as the number of the imported cases and the associated secondary cases generated 170 by the imported cases accumulated to a certain number (Figure 2A) . Thus, the increasing number of the 171 imported cases can be correlated to the outbreak spreads through the number of departure passenger data. We .

R 0 = 2.92 with incubation time \u03c4 = 5.2 days and \u03c4 = 14 days were used. CI Sec is the cumulative number of secondary infected cases generated by the imported cases. The actual arrival time of outbreak is defined as the the date when the number of cumulative cases is larger than the threshold number 8 and the number of newly reported cases is larger than 5. 9.2 days reporting lag between the date of onset and the date of diagnosis was estimated using the top five cities with most number of confirmed cases. Figure 4 and supplementary Figure S7 ).\n\nIn contrast, a longer latent period shortened the outbreak arrival time by allowing more secondary cases.\n\nConsidering the same R 0 setting but with incubation time 14 days, on day 28 the total number of secondary 213 cases raised to 1179.8 persons for all the top ten visiting cities in which Beijing contributes 180 persons in the 214 total secondary cases. Therefore, the longer latent period allowed 22% more secondary cases. The arrival time 215 of outbreak emergence were 14-18 days ( Figure 5A ), which were 2 days earlier than using 5.2 days latent 216 period. On day 18, all top ten cities except Shenyang have outbreak probability more than 50% ( Figure 5B ).\n\nThe results confirmed that if latent period is long, more ill people can move to other cities.

Therefore, in addition to R 0 = 2.92, we made the same calculation under a low transmission setting with 228\n\n.

Under these scenarios, following the suggestion from a recent 232 study [23] , we considered the initial infected number as 1000 on 31 December.\n\nWhen R 0 = 1.4, the cumulative secondary infected number was slowly linearly increasing and the top visiting 235 city had 6.8 cases on 28 January, which was below the critical threshold line \u03bd = 8 (supplementary Figure S2) . 236\n\nFor each of the top ten cities, the arrival time at which the cumulative number of secondary cases larger than the 237 critical threshold was determined (supplementary Table S1 ). Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou had the shortest 238 required time periods. However, the arrival times of outbreak emergence in the above cities were between 239 31-34 days, corresponding to the end of January and the early of February, which were about more than 10 days 240 later comparing to the actual reported data (supplementary Table S1 ). The mean arrival time of the top 10 241 visiting cities was 39 days, which was 21 days later than R 0 = 2.92. With R 0 = 1.68, the mean arrival time 242 was 26.3 days. Given the reporting delay was about 10 days, we found that R 0 = 2.92 with latent period 5.2 243 days gave a better prediction compared to other low R 0 or long latent period settings. 244 15 .

The COVID-19 virus is able 267 to establish between human-to-human transmission [3] and is currently spreading from Wuhan to many nearby 268 cities and countries. It is hypothesized that the rate of transmission between different cities or countries is 269 related to the number of people moving from different locations to Wuhan. About 2 weeks later after 31 270 December, using the number of cases detected outside China, it has been inferred that more than a thousand 271 individuals (with an estimated mean 1723) had had an onset of symptoms by 12 January, 2020 [25] .\n\nThe study demonstrated that after reporting delay was estimated, the dynamics of the outbreaks at connected when the outbreak will arrive [26] and how to delay the arrival time to have a better preparation. The challenge, 277 however, is that we lack a simple and accurate tool for assessing outbreak emergence risk and subsequently the 278 required levels of border control and quarantine measures to prevent additional outbreaks.\n\nUntil recently, although some studies have been done to predict the spreading of this new disease using air and 281 other forms of transport information [6, 7, 27, 28, 29] , none of studies were designed to estimate the dynamics 282 of the imported and secondary cases. The benefit of stratifying the imported and secondary cases in a disease 283 transmission model is to provide a risk assessment of community spread. Because most of the imported cases 284 can be detected more easily under 14 days quarantine from the passengers coming from the epidemic source 285 region, thus the risk of outbreak is not primarily linked to the number of the imported cases. However, 286 secondary cases, without travel history to the epidemic source region, are more difficult to be identified or 287 quarantined before disease onset and thus are more easily to become undetected cases in a community. infectious disease control [30] . A recent study has used a modeling approach to forecast the dynamics of 292 outbreak spreading [27] . We developed an \"easy-to-use\" mathematical formula that are able to have an 293 analytical solution of the first wave transmission (imported cases) and the second wave transmission (secondary 294 cases generated by the imported cases). With these numbers, we are able to evaluate the impact of border 295 18 .

Surprisingly, under the higher R 0 setting (2.92), the effect on obtaining 10 extra days requires an enhanced border control measure to reduce more than 90% of the passengers or a very 297 efficient quarantine measure. The results suggest that if the epidemic growth at the source location is high, even 298 a near full-scale border control without proper quarantine measure, will have only limited effects. The 299 transmission waves can be treated as a branching process. However, instead of using the offspring variability to 300 estimate the probability of extinction, we adopted a classical way to derive probability of extinction that was 301 based on R 0 or effective R.\n\nWe have learnt from the previous SARS outbreak that it is crucial to implement rapid infection control 304 measures to limit the impact of epidemics, both in terms of preventing more casualties and shortening the 305 epidemic period. Delaying the institution of control measures by 1 week would have nearly tripled the epidemic 306 size and would have increased the expected epidemic duration by 4 weeks [31] . Previous study showed that 307 control measures at international cross-borders and screening at borders are influential in mitigating the spread 308 of infectious diseases [32] [33] . Cross-boarder screening system to prevent infectious disease outbreak is 309 important but cannot successfully prevent ill persons during their latent period. imposed. Here the model we constructed can be used to estimate the dynamics of imported and secondary cases 314 using transportation data with different control measurements. The framework can be extended to multiple 315 infected sources to multiple target cities without increasing the complexity of the computation dramatically. 316 Hence, the model proposed in the current study could provide a risk assessment of COVID-19 global spreading 317 in a highly connected world."}
