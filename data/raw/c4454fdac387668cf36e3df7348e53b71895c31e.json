{"title": "", "body": "This chapter covers disorders of the calf from birth until postweaning. The first section deals with navel ill, umbilical hernia, and general conditions of the navel. Later sections cover different forms of diarrhea and alopecia, with a miscellaneous group including calf diphtheria and joint ill. According to the presenting signs, other diseases of calfhood are considered in the relevant chapters; for example, lice, ringworm, and skin diseases are to be found in Chapter 3, respiratory problems in Chapter 5, and meningitis in Chapter 9.\n\nA calf mortality rate of 5% of live births is considered to be an acceptable figure. A \"target\" neonatal mortality rate could be 3%. Much higher losses may occur where husbandry and management are poor. There are many reasons why the young calf is particularly susceptible to disease. Its immunological defense mechanisms are not fully developed. It will be going through the transition from passive to active immunity. The abomasum is less acidic, especially in the first few days of life, and this reduces the rate of kill of enterobacteriaciae and other ingested organisms. The calf may have several changes of diet. Moreover, the navel provides an additional early route by which infection may enter the body. Many calf diseases are exacerbated by failure to provide adequate housing, management, or colostral intake.\n\nClinical features: umbilical eventration is seen in a small proportion of calves immediately after birth. The prolapsed intestines (jejunum) may be fully exposed, as in the Friesian (2.1), or contained in a sac of peritoneum. Opening the sac in a Charolais calf revealed a congested intestine (2.2). Often the exposed intestine ruptures when the calf moves. The prognosis is then hopeless. In more advanced and exposed cases the intestinal loops turn a deep red/purple color due to ischemic necrosis (2.1).\n\nManagement: except in the very recent (<3 hours) case, surgery is rarely warranted.\n\nDefinition: inflammation, usually by infection, of the tissues of the umbilicus.\n\nClinical features: lacking skin or any other protective layer, the moist, fleshy navel cord is particularly prone to infection until it dries up, normally within 1 week of birth. In the first calf (2.3) (shown at 3 days old) the enlarged and still moist navel cord is seen entering an umbilical vein, adjacent to the navel, B. Spontaneous rupture of the abscess can lead to death from peritonitis, as in this calf. Occasional cases involve the urachus to produce a cystitis which can lead to stunted growth, sickness, and death several months after birth.\n\nSepticemia can result in localization of infection in the joints (2.48, 2.49), meninges, endocardium, or endarteries of limbs.\n\nDifferential diagnosis: umbilical hernia (2.9), eventration (2.1), granuloma (2.7).\n\nManagement: cleansing, removal of necrotic tissue, drainage, including use of a catheter to perform deep flushing of intra-abdominal lesions, and prolonged inflamed and swollen umbilical ring. Navel ill is uncommon at this age.\n\nThe more typical case is pyrexic, with a swollen, painful navel exuding a foul-smelling creamy-white pus (2.4). Culture usually reveals a mixed bacterial flora including Escherichia coli, Proteus, Staphylococcus, and Arcanobacte rium pyogenes. This case persisted for several weeks.\n\nAlopecia on the medial aspects of the thighs (2.5) is due to a combination of urine scald and excessive cleansing of the navel by the owner. Some cases show no gross discharge, but the tip of the swollen navel will be moist and malodorous.\n\nIn other cases an intra-abdominal abscess may develop in the omphalic (umbilical) vein. In 2.6, A shows the intra-abdominal abscess in the grossly distended systemic antibiotics. Prevention involves improved hygiene at calving, routine use of topical dressings to disinfect and desiccate the moist navel cord, and optimal colostral intake.\n\nDefinition: a tumor-like mass of granulation tissue due to a chronic inflammatory process at the navel.\n\nClinical features: a small bifurcated mass of granulation tissue protrudes from the navel of this 2-week-old calf (2.7). Many cases consist of a single mass of tissue. It is only slightly painful and affected calves are generally not pyrexic, although there may be superficial infection present, as in this case. The condition will not resolve 2.5. Alopecia secondary to navel ill (Friesian) 2.6. Autopsy with omphalic venous abscessation and peritonitis A B 2.7. Umbilical granuloma (Hereford cross) 2.8. Large umbilical granuloma 2.9. Umbilical hernia until the mass is removed by ligation at its base. If left untreated (2.8), it will persist into adult life.\n\nClinical features: a large, soft, and fluctuating ventral abdominal swelling can be seen in this 3-month-old Friesian calf (2.9). The arched back in this calf clearly depicts discomfort. Many smaller hernias are not associated with pain. Rarely, in moderate-sized umbilical hernias, the jejunal loops become strangulated, and the calf is in severe pain, becomes toxemic, and dies within a day or two. Autopsy of one such case (2.10) shows the multiple loops with severe serosal hemorrhage. Although present from birth, some hernias are not noticed until the calf is at least 2-3 weeks old. A proportion of cases are inherited. Irreducible and strangulated hernias are uncommon.\n\nDifferential diagnosis: navel abscess (2.11), urolithiasis (10.7), ruptured urethra (10.7).\n\nManagement: small hernial rings often close within 6 months and do not require treatment. Large hernias require corrective surgery.\n\nClinical features: the swelling in this 4-month-old Friesian male (2.11) is cranial to the prepuce (compare urolithiasis (10.7), where it is caudal), and appeared 2.10. Jejunal loops in strangulated umbilical hernia 2.11. Umbilical abscess (Friesian, 4 months old) 2.12. Umbilical abscess and rumen fistula (Friesian, 3 months old) 2.13. Enlarged view of umbilical rumen fistula spontaneously. The mass was initially hard, hot, and painful. Pyrexia led to systemic illness. Parenteral antibiotics resulted in a change to a more fluctuating swelling, which was successfully lanced and drained.\n\nA hernia and an umbilical abscess can occur together. Occasionally, navel ill or navel abscess produces a localized peritonitis that erodes through the rumen wall to produce a rumenal fistula. 2.12 shows a 3-month-old Friesian male with a grossly enlarged navel sac, soiled anteriorly. Rumen contents leaked through the fistula, shown in close-up in 2.13. Differential diagnosis: navel ill (2.3), umbilical hernia (2.9), rectourethral fistula (2.15).\n\nManagement: careful investigation is needed to define any intra-abdominal involvement such as a urachal abscess. Exploratory surgery, with guarded prognosis.\n\nNavel suckling (2.14) is a common vice in group-housed, bucket-fed calves, especially if they are in poor condition\n\nCalf scour Etiology and pathogenesis: enteritis and diarrhea in calves are major causes of death in the first few weeks of life. A wide range of agents can be involved, some producing diarrhea with or without dehydration, others leading to systemic involvement. Diarrhea in the first few days of life is commonly caused by bacterial infections, for example, E. coli or Clostridium perfringens. Their toxins lead to hypersecretion from the intestine and subsequent fluid loss, seen as diarrhea. Viral infections (rotavirus and coronavirus) and Cryptosporidia typically occur at 10-14 days (as maternal colostral antibody wanes), and are considered the major causes of calf scour. Diarrhea occurs because the intestinal wall is damaged, preventing resorption of fluid. Salmonella scouring can occur at any age.\n\nThe role of other agents (e.g., parvovirus, Breda virus, a calici-like virus, and astrovirus, BVD, and IBR viruses) in the calf scour syndrome has not been well defined.\n\nManagement: hygiene, colostrum, and good feeding practices are very important for control. Vaccines are available against E. coli, rotavirus, coronavirus, and Sal monella. It is not possible to differentiate fully between the various causes of scour on the basis of gross appearance and clinical signs alone, although the following illustrations give a few guidelines.\n\nClinical features: the majority of calves become infected with rotavirus, coronavirus, and Cryptosporidia, but normally only those subjected to a heavy challenge or concurrent disease show clinical signs. The cross-bred Limousin calf (2.16) is bright and alert, but has pasty yellow diarrhea around the tail. Both rotavirus and Crypt osporidia were identified in the feces. Increased mucus may be passed. There may be tenesmus with Cryptospori dia. More advanced cases (2.17) show dehydration and general systemic involvement such as sunken eyes, a dry muzzle, hyperemia of the nares, and a purulent nasal discharge. At autopsy 2 days later, the colon was thickened, corrugated, and exuding blood (2.18). Cryp tosporidia, rotavirus, coronavirus, and enterotoxigenic E. coli (responsible for the hemorrhagic colitis) were all isolated.\n\nClinical features: \"white scour\" occurs when intestinal damage is such that partially digested white milk is passed in the feces. Note the characteristic white fecal soiling of the flanks and tail in this 3-week-old Holstein heifer (2.19). Originally considered to be part and have intercurrent diseases. The calf being sucked has an enlarged navel, which could be infected. There is hair loss around the navel, indicating a chronic problem. The ears, tail, and scrotum can also be suckled.\n\nManagement: rear calves in single pens until 1 week postweaning. Feed milk from teats, not bucket. Control intercurrent disease.\n\nNote the very soiled hair around the navel and prepuce, and the discolored urine in this 2-day-old Holstein male (2.15). \n\nDefinition: a widespread contagious disease caused by Salmonella spp., localized in almost any organ, leading to enteritis, septicemia, arthritis, and meningitis. S. enterica, serovar Typhimurium is most common, but many other serovars may be involved.\n\nClinical features: a 1-week-old crossbred Hereford calf (2.22) is moribund and passing dysenteric feces, a mixture of blood, mucus, and intestinal mucosal lining. Classically, necropsy revealed a diphtheritic enteritis (2.23), with thickening of the mucosa. However, not all calves are affected so severely. Although Salmonella enter ica, serovar Typhimurium was isolated from the dysenteric feces of the affected 3-week-old Friesian calf (2.24), it was only mildly ill. Other cases show slight intestinal inflammation, the main changes being lung congestion and epicardial and renal hemorrhages. Animals recovering from peracute septicemia (especially S. dublin) may occasionally develop necrosis of the extremities, particularly in the ear tips, tail and legs. The 4-month-old Friesian (2.25) was recovering from a nonspecific pyrexia that had affected it some 6 weeks previously. Enteritis had not been observed, and is often not involved, but later ear tip necrosis produced a bilateral slough of more than half of the pinna. S. dublin was isolated from the feces. In the 4-month-old crossbred Hereford (2.26), circumferential skin necrosis immediately above the hind fetlocks has produced gangrene and necrosis of the extremities. Overextension at the fetlocks is probably due to flexor tendon rupture. Salivation is a pain response.\n\nDifferential diagnosis: many other causes of enteritis including digestive upsets, E. coli septicemia (p. 17), coccidiosis (2.32), ergot poisoning (7.159), constricting wire around leg (7.156).\n\nManagement: treatment should include fluids and electrolyte solutions given orally or in severe cases intravenously. Prophylaxis includes isolation of diseased calves, improved hygiene and adequate colostral intake in the first 6 hours after birth. Dam vaccination protects against enteritis, septicemia, and abortion, and also reduces Salmonella excretion rates in both dam and calf. Calves may also be vaccinated. Thorough cleansing and disinfection between batches, including \"all in/all out\" systems, as well as vermin control are important in eliminating reservoirs of Salmonella. The zoonotic risk should always be borne in mind.\n\nClinical features: in calves the majority of abomasal ulcers are subclinical, and may be associated with irregular feeding, overfeeding, and/or overconsumption of dry feed. More advanced cases show low-grade abdominal pain, developing into peritonitis if the ulcer perforates.\n\nThe 2-week-old Friesian (2.27) was moribund, with drooping ears, sunken eyes, and regurgitated rumen contents on its lips. It died within hours. Autopsy revealed an acute abomasitis with two perforated ulcers (2.28) with a creamy-white necrotic lining. Death was due to acute peritonitis (2.29). Fibrin and food coat the serosal surface of an inflamed and dilated small intestine. Abomasal ulcers are also seen in adult cattle (4.72, 4.73), in veal calves and in thriving beef calves, 2-4 months old, at pasture. drugs, and antibiotics aid control of inflammation and ulceration.\n\nPrevention: avoid overfeeding, sudden dietary changes, and excessive milk flow rates through teats.\n\nDefinition: atony of the abomasum is followed by gaseous distension, then by torsion. Both may be secondary to abomasal ulceration.\n\nDefinition: coccidiosis is an infection of the lower small intestine, cecum, colon, and rectum, caused by the protozoan parasite Eimeria. A wide range of species are involved, with E. zuernii and E. bovis being the most pathogenic. Infestations in the small intestine are considered to be less pathogenic due to the more rapid cellular regeneration than in the large intestine, and because the large intestine provides a further opportunity for the resorption of water.\n\nClinical features: disease is usually associated with calves crowded in damp and unhygienic conditions. Adult animals (e.g., suckler cows) may be carriers, though oocysts may survive many months in the environment. The incubation period is 17-21 days. Affected calves are dull, pyrexic, and typically produce watery feces, usually mixed with blood. Tenesmus (2.31), with continued straining and frequent passage of small quantities of blood and feces, is a characteristic sign. The anal sphincter is open, exposing the rectal mucosa. Hair loss on the inside of the leg results from fecal soiling. Another calf (2.32) shows a thickened and inflamed colonic mucosa. Blood on the surface of freshly passed feces unrelated to coccidiosis, is a normal feature of some calves, but it occurs more often following stress, e.g., transport, or sale through a livestock market.\n\nDifferential diagnosis: diagnosis depends on clinical signs, the demonstration of oocysts on fecal flotation or direct smear, and autopsy changes such as thickening and inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. Normal nonaffected calves may excrete lower numbers of oocysts.\n\nClinical signs: often sudden in onset. In the acute syndrome affected calves develop severe abomasal tympany, with loud splashing sounds audible from the excess fluid present. A surgical view of a typical distended abomasum filled with gas and fluid is seen in 2.30. Shock develops quickly, and affected calves are often found collapsed. Many cases, however, develop spontaneously even when single suckled.\n\nNSAIDs, antiinflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and nursing. Surgery (successful in 2.30) may be attempted on high-value animals. Management: supportive therapy with NSAIDs, fluid therapy, and antibiotics, but prognosis is poor.\n\nDefinition: a chronic low-grade brown digestive scour in calves before or after weaning, commonly on a group basis.\n\ncalves should be returned to a whole milk diet. Treatment with antibacterial and antiprotozoal agents such as decoquinate toltrazuril and sulfonamides may be useful.\n\nDefinition: accumulation of gas in the rumen in the milk-fed calf, and an associated rumenal atony.\n\nClinical features: rumen bloat is most commonly seen 1-2 hours after feeding milk or milk substitute, and is often associated with a pasty scour and bouts of colic, sometimes quite severe. It commonly results from feeding errors that lead to incomplete esophageal groove closure. Milk entering the rumen ferments and produces bloat with severe colic. Most incidents have a high morbidity but low mortality. The 4-week-old Hereford cross calf (2.38) shows severe ruminal tympany, with soiling of the tail and perineum, associated with chronic diarrhea which often accompanies the condition. Bloat also occurs in older cattle (see 4.61).\n\nDifferential diagnosis: abomasal dilatation, intestinal torsion.\n\nManagement: severe bloat can be relieved by passage of a stomach tube, or in extreme cases by trocar and cannula. Best option may be creation of a semi-permanent rumen fistula. Oral antibiotics will reduce further rumen fermentation, and NSAIDs will relieve the colic. Investigate and improve feeding practices. Suckling from a teat may be preferable to drinking from a bucket in some cases.\n\nThree distinct types of alopecia or hair loss in calves are illustrated.\n\nClinical features: initially feces appear slightly loose.\n\nAs the condition progresses, a brown \"pastey\" diarrhea is seen, with pronounced weight loss. Within group morbidity is high but mortality is low. On autopsy, the large intestine is grossly dilated and the contents watery. The 7-week-old white Friesian calf in the center of 2.37 is in poor condition, with its tail and perineum matted with feces. This is typical of the syndrome. These calves were fed unsuitable protein in a concentrate intended for adult cattle, and remained stunted for many months. Infection with Giardia and Campylobacter species has been implicated in some cases.\n\nDifferential diagnosis: digestive upsets, coccidiosis, enteric salmonellosis.\n\nManagement: improve rumen development by feeding well-balanced, high-quality rations. Inadequate intakes of concentrates preweaning may retard ruminal development. \"Coarse mix\" rations may produce fewer problems than pellets by reducing eating rate and increasing chewing and salivation. High-starch and low-fiber diets leading to rumen acidosis predispose to periweaning diarrhea, as will irregular feeding, poor rumen development, and antinutrient factors such as excessive levels of wheat gluten and trypsin inhibitors in soya. Improve hygiene. correct temperature, and given to calves that are eager to feed (having been primed by anticipation), thus ensuring that the esophageal groove is functional.\n\nDiphtheria (oral necrobacillosis)\n\nDefinition: an ulcerative necrosis of the cheek, tongue, pharynx, and larynx caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum.\n\nClinical features: diphtheria can produce a range of clinical signs including painful coughing, dyspnea, and a\n\nSpontaneous hair loss often occurs over the head, as in the crossbred Hereford calf (2.39). Less commonly, the whole body may be involved. Milk allergy and vitamin E deficiency are suggested causes. Most cases recover slowly over 1-2 months, without treatment.\n\nIn the Charolais cross calf (2.40), fecal soiling following severe rotavirus scour has totally denuded the perineum and ventral surface of the tail. Following longer bouts of recumbency, there may also be further hair loss over the hock and lower abdomen, including the navel. Urine scald may also be a contributory cause (2.5).\n\nAlopecia of this type is seen in calves fed milk substitute, and results from fat globules adhering to the skin over the muzzle. The causes include inadequate mixing of milk substitute, feeding it at too low a temperature, and calves that drink slowly. Hair loss on this 3-week-old crossbred Hereford (2.41) extends from the muzzle onto the nasal arch. The underlying pink skin shows secondary scab formation. Management: prompt, aggressive, and prolonged (7-10 days) treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, along with anti-inflammatory drugs for a few days. Joint lavage may be useful. Implantation of gentamycin beads or collagen sponges into the joints may give improved results. Response to treatment is generally poor, and many calves are culled when the diagnosis is confirmed.\n\nClinical features: pregnant cows have an increased iodine requirement, and deficient animals may give birth to stillborn or weakly calves with enlarged thyroids (>20 g), known as goiter. A subcutaneous swelling is clearly visible over the larynx in this 2-week-old Zebu calf from Brazil (2.51), but in the vast majority of cases there vocal processes (B) and the medial angles of the arytenoid cartilages (C), where it restricts air passage. In other cases (2.47) the caseous infection may be in the deeper tissues, such as on the left arytenoid area (A) of this 4-month-old Limousin cross calf, where the only superficial change is a soft tissue swelling, the caseous material being deeper within. Note the shape of the normal cartilage (B) on the right. Differential diagnosis: pharyngeal and laryngeal trauma, severe viral laryngitis (IBR), laryngeal edema or abscessation.\n\nManagement: prolonged (e.g., 2-3 weeks) therapy with parenteral antibiotics plus NSAIDs may be effective in early cases. In more advanced cases insertion of a tracheostomy tube under local anesthesia which is left in place for 3-4 weeks (sometimes removed and cleansed daily) to allow the airway to recover, can be reasonably effective.\n\nDefinition: non-specific, usually purulent, arthritis of one or more joints of young calves, generally resulting from septicemic spread from navel infection.\n\nClinical features: septicemic infection entering the navel at birth (see \"Navel ill\" p. 14) may localize in joints to produce arthritis and severe lameness, especially in colostrum-deficient calves. In the Friesian calf (2.48) the carpus is swollen as a result of intra-articular fibrinopurulent material and a periarticular soft tissue reaction. These changes are seen in the opened carpal joint in 2.49. Advanced cases (2.50) may lead to an open discharge and should be culled well before reaching this stage. Most affected calves are pyrexic. The hock, carpus, and stifle are commonly involved. Polyarthritis is often fatal. Joint ill is first seen at 3-4 weeks old (later than navel ill), and typical cases have no residual evidence of navel infection. "}
