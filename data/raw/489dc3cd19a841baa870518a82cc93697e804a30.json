{"title": "Clinical Features and Outcomes of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Predictive Factors for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious pulmonary disease that appears to have originated in southern China in the fall of 2002. The disease then spread to other parts of Asia, Europe and North America, with more than 8,000 cases now reported worldwide. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] The first two SARS cases in Taiwan were diagnosed in a couple on March 14, 2003;  6 the man had traveled to Guangdong Province and Hong Kong in February 2003. The couple was treated successfully in an intensive care unit (ICU) at medical center A. Subsequently, most SARS patients were treated at that medical center, until two clusters of cases were noted in late April, 2003, in Taipei. The origin of the outbreak was a laundry worker, aged 42 years, with diabetes mellitus, who was employed at hospital B. 7 As the index patient had been symptomatic for 6 days before SARS was diagnosed, the number of potentially exposed persons was estimated to be 10,000 patients and visitors, and 930 staff. Within less than 2 weeks, another outbreak of SARS clusters occurred in hospital C, which is near hospital B. Taipei Veterans General Hospital undertook the care of critically ill SARS patients, who were mainly transferred from hospital B and hospital C. The cause of SARS is a novel coronavirus. [8] [9] [10] [11] Natural clinical histories have ranged from febrile respiratory symptoms, without hypoxemia, to respiratory distress requiring intubation and, occasionally, resulting in death. [3] [4] Worldwide, the substantial mortality associated with SARS has varied markedly from 15-27%. 5 This paper provides a retrospective review of predictive factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with SARS treated at Taipei Veterans General Hospital.\n\nThe following criteria were used to evaluate the probability of SARS: 1. A history of close contact with a SARS patient, or evidence of traveling to SARS-endemic areas within 10 days before symptom onset. 2. Acute onset of fever > 38 C. 3. Respiratory symptoms, including cough or dyspnea. 4. Chest radiograph showing patchy or spotty pulmonary infiltrates. 5. ARDS without an identifiable cause. 6. Evidence of the transmission of pneumonia.\n\nPatients fulfilling criteria 1+2+3 were defined as suspected cases, while those meeting criteria 1+2+3+4, 2+3+5, or 2+3+4+6 were defined as probable cases. A diagnosis of SARS was not made if an alternative diagnosis could fully explain the illness. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), or antibodies for SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV), were used to confirm the diagnosis, but were not part of the diagnostic criteria.\n\nThis study included all patients with SARS admitted to Taipei Veterans General Hospital between March 20 and July 5, 2003, even though 14 cases in our cohort were reported previously by Chiang et al. 12 Thirtythree patients were referred due to evidence of SARS noted at another hospital. These patients were categorized according to the most severe clinical condition, i.e. non-ARDS or ARDS, with ARDS defined according to the American-European consensus conference: 13 1. Non-ARDS: patients with a ratio of partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO 2 )/fractional inspired oxygen (FIO 2 ) > 200 mmHg, and who did not develop ARDS during their stay in the ward. 2. ARDS: patients with PaO 2 /FIO 2 200 mmHg, and with bilateral lung infiltrates at admission or during their stay in the ward.\n\nAll patients were isolated for treatment, which included antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infection. The choice of antibiotics was based on empirical knowledge of the common atypical pathogens encountered in the community. Other antibiotics were administered to patients with established bacterial infection according to the results of drug-sensitivity testing after bacterial culture. The administration of ribavirin, intravenous immunoglobulin or corticosteroids was determined by physicians. Patients were intubated when respiratory failure developed, i.e. PaO 2 < 90% during the administration of 100% supplemental oxygen with or without a respiratory rate of more than 35 breaths per minute.\n\nA clinical database was constructed to document patient demographics, including the following: date of onset of initial symptoms; initial abnormal radiographic findings; date of admission to the hospital; tracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation; other comorbid conditions; and treatments for, and short-term outcomes of, the acute illness. The main parameters monitored at, and every 2-3 days after, hospital admission comprised complete blood count (CBC), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and blood gases. Chest films were taken daily during the early hospital stay, and every 2-5 days during convalescence. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV was performed routinely on nasopharyngeal swabs on days 1 and 7 of hospitalization. Assays for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies were performed on day 21 of hospitalization, and 2 weeks after hospital discharge.\n\nWe compared differences in epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory measures between patients who developed ARDS and those who did not. Square-root transformation was performed, for CBCs and biochemical parameters, for the normality of data. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to check normality. The Student's t test was adapted to normal-distribution data. For continuous variables not fitted to a normal distribution, median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were calculated as summaries of distribution, and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was adapted for comparison. A Chi-squared test was used to compare the category variables. For calculating the odds ratio of ARDS in the logistic regression analysis, each variable was dichotomized using a \"normal-limits\" value as cutoff (except for CRP [cut-off, 5 mg/L] and age [65 years]). To dichotomize the variable \"comorbidities\", the study group was divided into patients with (value of 1) or without underlying disease (value of 0). A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All analyses were carried out using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 11.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).\n\nA total of 67 patients with SARS were admitted to our hospital between March 20 and July 5, 2003, which represented 10% (67 of 668) of all documented, probable SARS cases in Taiwan. The patients comprised 32 men and 35 women; mean age standard deviation (SD) was 51.0 21.9 years (range, 23-86 years) ( Table 1) . Twenty-five patients (37.3%) were medical professionals and the others had various occupations. Thirty-three (49.3%) patients required mechanical ventilatory support. Patients without ARDS were significantly younger than patients with ARDS (39.1 16.5 years vs 63.4 20.0 years). All patients received nasopharyngealswab RT-PCR tests routinely on days 1 and 7 of hospitalization, and only 22 patients (32.8%) had positive findings. Thirty-three patients had assays for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies on day 21 of hospitalization; 28 of them (84.8%) had positive findings. The most common initial clinical symptoms were fever (95.5% of patients), cough (65.7%) and dyspnea (49.3%); watery diarrhea was noted in less than 20% of patients. Fortytwo patients (62.7%) had other comorbid conditions, which principally included diabetes mellitus (n = 16), viral hepatitis (n = 12), hypertension (n = 13), and cerebrovascular accident (CVA; n = 8). Levofloxacin was used in a total of 49 patients (73.1%), whereas other antibiotics were used significantly more frequently in patients with ARDS rather than in those without (26 vs 17; p = 0.021). The administration of ribavirin, intravenous immunoglobulin or corticosteroids did not differ significantly between patients with ARDS and those without, although pulse corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone 500 mg intravenously every 12 hours for 2-3 days) was given to four patients with ARDS versus none of the non-ARDS patients (p = 0.053). The mean length of hospital stay was significantly shorter for patients without ARDS than for survivors of ARDS (19.8 days vs 39.3 days; p < 0.001) ( Table 1) .\n\nThe overall mortality rate was 31.3% (21 of 67 patients), whereas the mortality rate for patients who underwent mechanical ventilation was 63.6% (21 of 33).\n\nLaboratory indices during hospitalization are summarized in Table 2 . Sixteen patients (23.9%) had a leukocyte count < 3,500/mm 3 , 57 (85.1%) had a lymphocyte count < 1,000/mm 3 \n\nChest radiographs revealed changes relating to pneumonia, although 17 patients (25.4%) did not have pulmonary infiltrates at initial radiograph. Combined central and peripheral lesions were evident in most patients, and most had rapid progression from a single localized lesion. The most common locations were the bilateral lower lung regions (Table 3 ). In the 17 patients with an initial normal radiograph, and who subsequently developed consolidation, the average time from fever onset to an abnormal radiograph was 4.6 6.8 days (range, 1-13 days).\n\nWe used a logistic multiple regression model to uncover risk factors for the development of ARDS. This model included LDH, CRP, age more than 65 years, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, previous CVA, and male gender, from univariate logistic regression analyses. Odds ratios for ARDS development in the 67 patients with SARS (Table 4 ).\n\nTaiwan has had the third largest number of SARS cases, after Hong Kong and China. To date, however, no large, formal analysis of the data from Taiwan can Since our hospital was responsible for the management of critical cases in northern Taiwan, the outcomes shown were more severe than in other medical settings. Initial clinical presentations and laboratory features were similar to those in other series. Symptoms of acute respiratory distress developed in about half of the patients (33/67; 49.3%); 21 of these patients (63.6%) died and the other 12 were discharged from hospital. The risk factors for ARDS were age more than 65 years, diabetes mellitus, and elevated LDH level. Other researchers have also documented independent predictors associated with poor outcomes, e.g. acute illness leading to death; the need for mechanical ventilation; and ICU admission. 2 The diagnosis of SARS was based on a comprehensive contact history and precise laboratory tests. The World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for SARS have a reported sensitivity of 26% and specificity of 96%, 14 whereas the sensitivity of laboratory testing for SARS-CoV is less than 80%. 15 Since contact history has not been reliable after SARS cluster cases were noted in some community groups, one needed to be highly suspicious of any transmission of pneumonia. Our inclusion criteria added a component of transmission of pneumonia, and a high degree of clinical diagnostic accuracy was confirmed by laboratory tests. Hematologic abnormalities, especially lymphopenia, were common in our cohort, probably because of ribavirin therapy. Intravenous immunoglobulin was given when more severe hematologic abnormalities occurred. Pancytopenia and hemophagocytosis were noted in 2 patients without ARDS. This pheno-menon has been noted in other viral infections, and the outcome was fair after supportive treatment. 16, 17 In our cohort, elevation of AST was more obvious than that of ALT in the ARDS group. Since carriers of hepatitis B virus did not show profound lung injury, whether SARS-CoV will interact with hepatitis B virus\n\nis not yet clear. The location of pulmonary infiltration in SARS patients has been reported to be the peripheral lungs. 18, 19 In our cohort, initial infiltrative lesions were mainly located in the central and peripheral lungs. The best explanation for this is that anterior and posterior peripheral lesions would be projected to a central location on posteroanterior chest radiograph. The efficacy of treatment was difficult to evaluate because patients usually received a combination of medications, including antiviral, broad-spectrum antibacterial and corticosteroid drugs, in addition to supportive therapy. Initially, because the cause of SARS was thought to be an atypical pathogen, 55 patients (82.1%) received empiric antibacterial therapy with a fluoroquinolone. Levofloxacin was the drug of choice in 49 patients (73.1%) because of its broad-spectrum activity against anaerobic and aerobic Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria. In patients who developed ARDS, stronger antibiotics such as fourth-generation cephalosporins, teicoplanin and carbapenems were more often used. There is no proven effective treatment for SARS; hence, there was no difference in the proportion of patients per group who received the antiviral ribavirin, intravenous immunoglobulin, or moderate amounts of corticosteroids. However, pulse corticosteroid therapy was more often used for ARDS than non-ARDS patients.\n\nOur study has several limitations. It was retrospective and had no standard medical chart for following clinical courses. Some important information may, therefore, have been lost, which may have led to bias in the comparison. To date, however, this is the largest clinical analysis of SARS in Taiwan."}
