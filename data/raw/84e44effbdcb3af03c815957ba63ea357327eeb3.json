{"title": "Screening of a composite library of clinically used drugs and well-characterized pharmacological compounds for cystathionine \u2424-synthase inhibition identifies benserazide as a drug potentially suitable for repurposing for the experimental therapy of colon cancer", "body": "In 1942, as part of his pioneering work that led to the description and characterization of the transsulfuration pathway, Du Vigneaud had noted the production of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) in liver homogenates incubated with homocysteine [1] . We now know that the enzyme responsible for this effect is cystathionine-\u2424synthase (CBS), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, expressed in various cells of the liver, kidney and the nervous system, where it plays a role in cysteine biosynthesis and degradation [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . CBS is unique among the PLP-dependent enzymes, as it also carries a N-terminal heme prosthetic group coordinated by Cys52 and His65 residues [7, 8] . Although heme is not required for enzymatic activity, its presence can affect its catalytic activity serving as a redox sensor. The C-terminal region of CBS exerts an autoinhibitory function by partially shielding the active site that can be alleviated by S-adenosyl methionine binding [7, 8] .\n\nH 2 S (a product of CBS-mediated cysteine degradation, as well as several other mammalian enzymes) is well recognized as a signaling molecule in mammals that controls fundamental cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, movement and cell death [3] [4] [5] [6] . At a molecular level, H 2 S regulates these processes by altering the activity of protein kinases, membrane ion channels and nuclear transcription factors as well key mitochondrial proteins involved in the regulation of cellular bioenergetics [3] [4] [5] [6] 9, 10] .\n\nWe have recently discovered that CBS is abundantly overexpressed in colon cancers when compared to surrounding normal colonic mucosa; CBS overexpression has also been detected in multiple colon cancer cell lines including HCT116, LoVo and HT29 [11] . The relative overexpression of CBS has also been reported in ovarian, breast and bladder cancers ( [12] [13] [14] , reviewed in [15, 16] ). Pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of CBS inhibits the proliferation of cancer cell lines and reduces the growth of tumor xenografts in vivo, identifying CBS as a preclinically-validated anticancer drug target [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . CBS has also been proposed as a therapeutic target for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [17] and stroke [18, 19] .\n\nHowever, currently there are no potent and selective CBS inhibitors available. Aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) is commonly referred to as a selective CBS inhibitor, even though it also inhibits another H 2 S-producing enzyme, cystathionine-gamma lyase (CSE) [20] as well as several transaminases [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Previous efforts to identify CBS inhibitors from commercially available libraries yielded compounds with relatively low potency and limited CBS selectivity [26, 27] . For instance, a recent high-throughput tandem-microwell assay identified 1,6-dimethyl-pyrimido [5,4- e]-1,2,4-triazine-5,7(1H,6H)-dione (NSC67078) as a CBS inhibitor, which, however, also inhibited CSE with a potency that was only 3-fold lower [27] . In a further effort to identify CBS inhibitors, we have conducted a screen of a composite library of 8871 drugs and well-annotated pharmacological compounds. The screen identified several CBS inhibitors including benserazide. Additional studies demonstrated that benserazide is an effective inhibitor of colon cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor xenograft growth in vivo, suggesting its potential for therapeutic repurposing as an antitumor agent.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, compounds were obtained from Sigma/Aldrich. Except for the studies using the libraries (which used pre-dissolved drugs in DMSO), all compounds were dissolved freshly prior to each experiment.\n\nRecombinant full length human CBS was purchased from Genscript Inc (Piscataway, NJ). The AzMC (7-azido-4-methylcoumarin) based screening (modified from [26] ) was carried out in 96-well plate format on an automated robotic system. This stand-alone robotic system is comprises of a plate washer (EL406, Biotek, Winooski, VT), a dispenser (MicroFlo, Biotek, Winooski, VT), a pipetting station (Precision, Biotek, Winooski, VT), an incubator (Cytomat 2C, Thermo Electron Corporation, Asheville, NC) and plate reader (Synergy 2, Biotek, Winooski, VT) connected with a robotic arm (Twister II, Caliper Life Sciences Inc, Hopkinton, MA). Test compounds, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), were added to each well to yield a final concentration of 30 M (5% DMSO) in a total assay volume of 200 l. The assay solution contained Tris HCl (50 mM, pH 8.0), human recombinant full-length CBS (5 g/well), the CBS substrates l-cysteine and homocysteine (each at 2.0 mM final concentration), pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), (5 M final concentration), and the H 2 S-specific fluorescent probe AzMc [26] (10 M final concentration). The 96 well plates were incubated at 37 \u2022 C, and the increase in the AzMc fluorescence in each well was read at 450 nm (ex = 365 nm) over a two-hour time course. A standard curve was generated using different concentrations of the H 2 S donor NaHS. The CBS inhibitors AOAA (30 M) [20] and NSC67078 (30 M) [27] (1,6-dimethyl-pyrimido[5,4-e]-1,2,4triazine-5,7(1H,6H)-dione; also known as toxoflavin, xanthothricin and PKF118-310) were used as positive controls. DMSO (5%) was used as a negative control. Data were analyzed in Gen5 and exported to Excel.\n\nThe CBS assay outlined above was modified in a way such that instead of recombinant CBS, the H 2 S donor GYY4137 [28] (final con- centration: 3 mM) was added to the assay mixture to generate the fluorescent AzMC signal. Compounds that inhibited this signal were classified as non-specific inhibitors (either because they scavenge H 2 S or because they interfere with the detection method).\n\nThe methylene blue assay, commonly used to detect H 2 S [20] was modified for 96-well format. Test compounds were added to each well in 10 l DMSO, to yield a final concentration of 10, 30, or 100 M. Control wells only received DMSO; positive control wells received the same concentrations of AOAA. The volume of the activity buffer was 50 l and contained 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0), human recombinant full-length CBS (5 g/well), the CBS substrates l-cysteine and homocysteine (each at 2.0 mM final concentration), and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), (5 M final concentration). The 96-well plate was sealed with PCR strips and incubated for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C. After the incubation, the plate was put directly on ice. Next, the strip was removed from the plate and 60 l of 1% ZnAc was added followed by 60 l of 10% TCA. Subsequently, 10 l of 60 mM N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and 10 l of 90 mM FeCl 3 were added to each well. The plate was incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The absorbance was read at 650 nm. \n\nThe AzMC assay, described above, was modified to assess the effect of benserazide on cystathionine-gamma lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) activity. Recombinant human CSE and 3-MST were obtained from Novus Biologicals. For CSE activity, CSE (2 g per well) was incubated with its substrate, l-cysteine (10 mM) in Tris HCl buffer for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C, followed by the detection of H 2 S via the AzMC method as described above. For 3-MST activity, 3-MST (2 g per well) was incubated with its substrate, 3-mercaptopyruvate (10 mM) in Tris HCl buffer for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C, followed by the detection of H 2 S via the AzMC method as described above.\n\nTo monitor cell proliferation in real time we used the xCELLigence system as described [29] . The system measures electrical impedance across interdigitated micro-electrodes integrated on the bottom of tissue culture E-Plates. The impedance measurement provides quantitative information about the biological status of the cells, including cell number, viability and adherence. HCT-116 cells were seeded at a density of 6000 cells/well in 200 l. 24 h after seeding, cells were treated with different concentrations of aurintricarboxylic acid, benserazide hydrochloride, tannic acid, hexachlorophene or 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzylhydrazine and the proliferation rate of the cells was measured for an additional 48 h. AOAA and NSC67078 were used as positive controls for CBS inhibition.\n\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release into the culture medium was used for the determination of HCT116 cell death as described [30] . Briefly, 30 l of supernatant was collected at 48 h and mixed with 100 l freshly prepared LDH assay reagent containing 85 mM lactic acid, 1 mM nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ), 0.27 mM N-methylphenazonium methyl sulfate (PMS), 0.528 mM 2-(4-Iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride (INT), and 200 mM Tris (pH 8.2). The changes in absorbance were read kinetically at 492 nm for 15 min (kinetic LDH assay) on a monochromator-based reader (Powerwave HT, Biotek) at 37 \u2022 C.\n\nAt 48 h after treatment of HCT116 cells with various test compounds, cells were incubated in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT, EMD BioSciences, San Diego, CA) for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C at 5% CO 2 [DM1] atmosphere as described [30] . The converted formazan dye was dissolved in DMSO and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm on a monochromator-based reader (Powerwave HT, Biotek) at 37 \u2022 C.\n\nExtracellular Flux Analysis (XF24 Analyzer, Seahorse Bioscience, Billerica, MA) was used to measure the effect of benserazide (10 M, 24 h of incubation) on the bioenergetic function of HCT116 cells as described previously [11, 31] . The XF24 creates a transient 7-l chamber in specialized microplates that allows for OCR (oxygen consumption rate) and ECAR (extracellular acidification rate) to be monitored in real time over 2-3 h. The changes of oxygen and proton concentrations are performed in real-time measurements via specific fluorescent dyes incorporated in Seahorse Flux Pak cartridges. Four key parameters of mitochondrial function (basal respiration, ATP turnover, proton leak, and maximal respiration) were assessed through the sequential use of 1.5 g/ml oligomycin (ATP synthase inhibitor), 0.5 M FCCP (oxidative phosphorylation uncoupler), and 2 M rotenone + 2 g/ml antimycin A (Complex I and III inhibitors). The difference between the maximal and the basal respirations was considered as the respiratory reserve capacity (the capacity of a cell to generate ATP via oxidative phosphorylation in response to an increased demand for energy). After the injection of oligomycin and the subsequent inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, ECAR (extracellular acidification rate) was also measured, as an index of the glycolytic capacity of the cells.\n\nBenserazide was docked as the theoretically predicted PLP adduct in the CBS active site using the Combiglide algorithm (Schrodinger Inc.) as described [32] [33] [34] . The algorithm combines accurate ligand-receptor scoring, highly efficient combinatorial docking algorithms and core-hopping technology to design focused libraries and identify new scaffolds. Docking was performed using the IFD induced-fit docking protocol as implemented in Small-Molecule Drug Discovery Suite 2016 (Schrodinger Inc., Small-Molecule Drug Discovery Suite, 2016-1) [32] . The IFD algorithm involves the use of Glide and Prime modules for docking and refinement, respectively, and it enables modeling of structural changes in proteins as an effect of ligand binding. This is achieved by implementing an improved sampling approach where specific sidechain or backbone atoms are allowed to rearrange after iterative cycles of docking and protein refinement [33, 34] . In this case, the sidechains of Lys119 and Gln222 were trimmed and Van der Waals atom radii scaling were set to 1 for the protein and 0.8 for the docked ligands. Prior to calculations, the two PLP-benserazide derivatives were prepared in terms of correct protonation states, tautomerism and stereoisomerism using the LigPrep routine (Schrodinger Inc.). The crystal structure of human CBS (pdb id: 1JBQ) was utilized for docking calculations. Protein preparation was performed by the corresponding routine as implemented in Maestro (Schrodinger Inc.). Water molecules of the CBS crystallographic structure were retained according to the ProtPrep default settings.\n\nAll animal studies were approved by the IACUC of UTMB. Athymic male and female mice (8-10 weeks, n = 18) were injected subcutaneously in either the right or left dorsum with 2 \u00d7 10 6 HT29 cells as described [11] . Three days later, the mice were randomized into two groups and injection subcutaneous (SQ) with either phosphate buffered saline (PBS, n = 9), or benserazide (50 mg/kg/day s.q., n = 9), once per days for the duration of the experiment. Benserazide solutions were made fresh daily, immediately prior to treatment of the animals. Tumor dimensions were measured daily transcutaneously using a caliper. Animal weights were also recorded.\n\nData are presented as mean \u00b1 SEM and were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software or SPSS. Statistical analyses included Student-t test or one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparisons.\n\nIn order to identify novel inhibitors of CBS, we screened 8866 clinically used drugs and well-annotated pharmacological compounds, a composite collection of 11 commercially available libraries and a small custom library assembled from known PLP-dependent enzyme inhibitor compounds consisting of the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor dl-difluoromethylornithine; the thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase inhibitor pemetrexed, the GABA transaminase inhibitor vigabatrin, the GABA transaminase and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor 3hydroxybenzylhydrazine and the DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa (Table 1 ). All compounds were screened at a concentration of 30 M. Compounds that showed >50% CBS inhibition at 30 M were considered potential hits. The number of potential hits varied between libraries. Some diversity collections (like LOPAC) yielded up to a dozen potential hits, some more specific collections (e.g. the ActiTarg P library or the PLP-dependent custom collection) didn't yield any potential hits. When a compound was represented in multiple libraries, it was positively identified as a potential hit compound multiple times, indicating the reliability of the screening assay. Individual CBS activities of all compounds tested (% of vehicle control), organized by libraries, are shown in Fig. 1 . The PLP-dependent enzyme inhibitor compounds were also re-tested in a broader concentration-response range (10-100 M); no inhibitory effects were observed for any of them, except with 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine, which inhibited CBS activity by 24, 37, and 68%, at 10, 30, and 100 M, respectively. Carbidopa was a weak inhibitor of CBS activity (6% inhibition at 100 M).\n\nConfirmatory assays were performed on compounds that were repurchased from commercial sources. The 30 most potent inhibitors of CBS-stimulated AzMC fluorescence signal are shown in Table 2 . Taking into account the fact that some of the compounds contain electrophilic moieties, which could directly react with H 2 S, as well as some of them can quench coumarin fluorescence, potential hit compounds were counterscreened with the H 2 S donor GYY4137 in identical reaction conditions. The majority of the potential hit compounds decreased GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence ( Table 2) .\n\nThe compounds that could be confirmed as CBS inhibitors with potency comparable to AOAA (and without significantly interfering with GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence) are hexachlorophene, tannic acid, aurintricarboxylic acid, and benserazide. These four compounds were further characterized, along with the principal reference compound AOAA [20] and the secondary reference compound, NSC67078 [27] . Inhibitory effect of the two Table 3 ; full concentration-response curves shown in Fig. 2 . The structures of the six compounds (two reference compounds and four compounds identified by the screen as bona fide CBS inhibitors) are shown in Fig. 3 . The CBS inhibitory effect of hexachlorophene, tannic acid, aurintricarboxylic acid, and benserazide were also confirmed using the methylene blue assay, which detects H 2 S production by a different principle than the AzMC assay (Table 3) . Unexpectedly, the second reference compound CBS inhibitor NSC67078, in addition to inhibiting CBS-induced AzMC fluorescence with an IC 50 of \u223c1 M, also inhibited GYY6137induced AzMC fluorescence with an IC 50 of \u223c6 M (Table 3 , Fig. 2B) indicating that the observed inhibitory effects are due to a combination of direct CBS inhibition as well as H 2 S scavenging and/or interference with the assay used to detect H 2 S. While conducting confirmatory dose-response work with the four compounds identified as CBS inhibitors, we have noted the aqueous instability of benserazide: while freshly made solutions produced the inhibition depicted above, storage of benserazide stock solutions in aqueous media or DMSO diminished its activity. For instance, while freshly dissolved benserazide at 100 M inhibited CBS activity by 66 \u00b1 1%, after preparing stock solutions in PBS or DMSO and storing them at \u221220 \u2022 C for 1 week, its potency decreased to 45 \u00b1 4% or 53 \u00b1 3% inhibition of CBS activity, respectively, at 100 M (n = 3); these data are Table 2 List of potential hit compounds identified by the primary screening, and effect of the same compounds on GYY4137-induced fluorescence responses. Compounds were screened at 30 M (except for compounds indicated by asterisk, where testing was conducted at the indicated concentration) against CBS-induced AzMC fluorescence and re-tested at 30 M (except for compounds indicated by asterisk, where testing was conducted at the indicated concentration) against CBS-and GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 3. consistent with prior findings showing the oxidation-prone character of benserazide [35, 36] . Hexachlorophene, tannic acid, aurintricarboxylic acid and benserazide, as well as the two reference compounds AOAA (Fig. 4) and NSC67078 (Fig. 5) were next tested on cell proliferation in the HCT116 human colon carcinoma cell line. Cytotoxicity was assessed, in parallel, by the LDH release assay and the MTT assay. AOAA and NSC67078 concentration-dependently inhibited cell proliferation, with IC 50 values of 300 M and 0.3 M, respectively (Figs. 4 and 5) . The effect of NSC67078 was also associated with a suppression of MTT conversion (Fig. 5) . From the four compounds identified by the CBS screen, hexachlorophene (the least potent CBS inhibitor among the four identified hit compounds), did not affect HCT116 proliferation up to 3 M, but fully inhibited cell proliferation at 10 M (Fig. 6) . However, at this concentration, the compound also exerted cytotoxic effects, as indicated by the increase in LDH release (Fig. 6C) . The polyphenol tannic acid concentration-dependently inhibited proliferation, starting with 10 M; complete inhibition was seen at 100 M, without signs of cytotoxicity (Fig. 7) . Aurintricarboxylic acid, although it exhibited in vitro CBS inhibitory potency comparable to AOAA, did not inhibit cell proliferation at 10-100 M, while at 300 M increased cell proliferation (Fig. 8) . Although benserazide was less potent at inhibiting recombinant CBS than AOAA in the cell-free assay, it was more potent than AOAA in the proliferation assay. Benserazide inhibited the proliferation of HCT116 cells with a steep dose-response curve. Concentrations up to 10 M exerted no inhibitory effects, whereas at 30 M, benserazide completely inhibited HCT116 proliferation. and increased LDH release (Fig. 9) .\n\nAmong the most potent potential hit compounds identified ( Table 2) , several of them contained copper, for instance ST012942 and the chlorophyllide Cu 2+ complex Na salt (contained in the \"killer plates\" library and the natural product library, respectively). However, ST012861 (a copper-free analogue of ST012942), failed to inhibit recombinant CBS activity (Fig. 10A) , suggesting that copper itself may be the inhibitor of CBS activity. In addition to inhibiting CBS-induced AzMC fluorescence, ST012942 also inhibited GYY4137-induced AzMC responses, although with a lower potency (IC 50 : 0.1 M vs. 1 M) (Fig. 10B) . In a follow-up assay we Table 4 Effect of three copper compounds on CBS-and GYY4137-induced H2S/AzMC fluorescence responses. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM of n = 3 separate determinations.\n\n% inhibition of CBS-induced AzMC fluorescence % inhibition of GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence\n\nhave tested the effect of three different Cu 2+ salts on the activity of recombinant CBS-induced AzMC fluorescence, as well as on GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence. As shown in Table 4 , all salts: copper(II) chloride; copper(II) acetate and copper(II) nitrate exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on recombinant CBS with an IC 50 \u223c 0.2 M. A lesser degree of inhibitory effect was also noted on GYY4137-elicited AzMC responses (\u223c15% inhibition at 1 M; IC 50 , \u223c1 M). In fact, the effects of the copper-containing compound ST012942 and the effects of CuCl 2 were overlapping, both on CBSand GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence values (Fig. 10) . To further investigate the role of CBS inhibition by copper we performed cell proliferation assay in the HCT116 cells. As shown in Fig. 11 , copper only inhibited HCT116 cells proliferation at the highest concentration tested (1 mM), which also decreased MTT conversion and LDH activity. The paradoxical reduction in LDH activity is most likely the result of the previously reported [37] direct inhibition of the LDH enzyme by copper ions. The major benserazide metabolite 2,3,4trihydroxybenzylhydrazine (THBH, also known as Ro 04-5127) also acted as a CBS inhibitor with potency comparable to benserazide (at 10, 30 and 100 M, it exerted a 31 \u00b1 2%, 51 \u00b1 2% and 82% inhibition of recombinant CBS activity, n = 3) and inhibited HCT116 cell proliferation in vitro at 10-300 M; it reduced MTT conversion at 300 M, but did not exert cytotoxic effects, as evidenced by a lack of significant increase of LDH concentrations in the cell culture medium (Fig. 12) .\n\nBenserazide contains a free \u2424-hydroxyamine group, which can react with aldehyde groups to produce Schiff bases. To gain insight to the putative mode of CBS inhibition by benserazide, docking calculations were performed by considering the two distinct PLPbenserazide derivatives that could be potentially formed, with either of them potentially representing the actual inhibitor of the protein (Fig. 13 ). Compound 1 (Fig. 13A, top) is the derivative of the coupling between the free amine of the unmodified benserazide with the formyl functionality of PLP while compound 2 (Fig. 13A, bottom) is the derivative obtained by reaction of the major benserazide metabolite 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzylhydrazine with the respective moiety of PLP. Both molecules are expected to be relatively kinetically stable, as the resulting Schiff bases carry an aromatic ring substitution. Compound 1 and Compound 2 were docked to the PLP-binding site of CBS using an induced-fit docking protocol enabling additional flexibility and enhanced sampling for modeling structural rearrangements of the target upon binding. Docking results showed that although both molecules adopted a highly identical geometry with respect to each other and the crystallographic free PLP cofactor, the PLP-benserazide derivative 1 was systematically bound demonstrating moderately higher docking scores than the corresponding PLP-trihydroxybenzylhydrazine derivative 2 with respective differences of \u223c1 kcal/mol (best pose score: 1, \u22129.91 kcal/mol; 2, \u22128.83 kcal/mol). On this basis, the higher affinity predicted for 1 was attributed to the interaction geometry that permitted formation of additional hydrophobic contacts with the protein environment as well as extensive hydrogen bonding interactions between the trihydroxybenzyl ring and polar residues located at the periphery of the cavity such as His203, Tyr223 and Tyr308 with respect to the corresponding, less-favorable interaction geometry of 2 (Fig. 13B,C) . While an equilibrium between the two different states of benserazide cannot be ruled out in the assay conditions, docking shows that the two molecules demonstrate a high structural convergence in terms of binding orientation.\n\nThe CBS inhibitory potency of benserazide was dependent on the concentration of the substrates used in the assay mixture. Reduction of the concentration of cysteine and homocysteine from 2 mM (our standard assay conditions) to 0.5 mM increased the inhibitory potency of benserazide. For instance, under standard assay conditions, 10 M benserazide inhibited CBS activity by 29 \u00b1 1%, while under low substrate conditions, the same concentration of benserazide exerted a 61 \u00b1 2% inhibitory effect; n = 3). On the other hand, doubling of substrate concentrations to 10 mM reduced the inhibitory potency of benserazide. For instance, under standard assay conditions, 100 M benserazide inhibited CBS activity by 66 \u00b1 1%, while under high substrate conditions, the same concentration of benserazide exerted a 10 \u00b1 2% inhibitory effect; n = 3) Benserazide was relatively selective as a CBS inhibitor, because CSE activity was only slightly affected (a 16 \u00b1 6% inhibition at 100 M; Benserazide, at 10 M, exerted an inhibitory effect on the bioenergetics o HCT116 colon cancer cells; it inhibited oxidative phosphorylation/mitochondrial electron transport (Fig. 14A) , without significantly affecting glycolysis (Fig. 14B ). In addition to HCT116 cells, benserazide also inhibited cell lines proliferation in the colon cancer cell line HT29 (Fig. 15 ); this cell line -similar to HCT116 cells -expresses high levels of CBS [11] . At 100 M (but not at lower concentrations) benserazide also exerted cytotoxic effects in HT29 cells (Fig. 15 ). In contrast, benserazide did not inhibit proliferation in another colon cancer cell line LoVo (Fig. 16) ; this cell line has a lower expression of CBS, and it expresses high levels of CSE, another H 2 S-producing enzyme [11] . Finally, benserazide prevented the growth of HT29 subcutaneous xenografts in tumor-bearing nude mice in vivo (Fig. 17) .\n\nThe main conclusions of the current study are the following: (a) from a composite library of 8871 clinically used drugs and well-annotated pharmacological compounds, 4 compounds were identified with CBS inhibitory activity and no non-specific scavenging effects or interference with the assay conditions; these compounds were hexachlorophene, tannic acid, aurintricarboxylic acid and benserazide; (b) three of the identified CBS inhibitors also exerted inhibitory effects on HCT116 cell proliferation, while, unexpectedly, aurintricarboxylic acid failed to inhibit cell prolif-eration, and, in fact, it exerted stimulatory effects at the highest concentration tested; (c) benserazide was relatively selective as a CBS inhibitor (versus CSE and 3-MST); (d) modeling studies predict that benserazide, in a manner that is similar to the mode of AOAA's action, interacts with the PLP prosthetic group in the active site of CBS, which we view as the likely mode of CBS inhibition; (e) benserazide inhibits colon cancer cell proliferation in the high-CBS-expressor HCT116 and HT29 cell lines, but not in LoVo cells, which express a lower level of CBS; (f) benserazide inhibits cellular bioenergetics in HCT116 cells; and (g) benserazide suppresses colon cancer growth in tumor-bearing mice. Based on these data we suggest that benserazide should be further explored with respect to its potential suitability for therapeutic repurposing for cancer. Additional data presented in the current report confirm previous findings [38, 39] demonstrating that copper is a direct inhibitor of CBS activity. Finally, we confirmed that the reference compound AOAA is a CBS inhibitor and antiproliferative agent in colon cancer cells, while the second reference compound NSC67078 was found to potently inhibit not only the CBS-induced AzMC fluorescence response, but also the H 2 S donor GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence, suggesting that at least part of the inhibition of the CBS-induced signal is unrelated to direct inhibition of the catalytic activity of CBS. Nevertheless, NSC67078 was found to be a potent inhibitor of HCT116 cell proliferation in vitro.\n\nHexachlorophene (2,2 -methylenebis(3,4,6trichlorophenol)-3,4,6-trichloro-2-[(2,3,5-trichloro-6hydroxyphenyl)methyl]phenol) is an organochlorine compound that was once widely used as a disinfectant (a common use being the skin cleansing of newborns), until it was withdrawn due to safety issues [40] . Hexachlorophene is known to have several pharmacological activities, including the inhibition of TAR DNA binding protein [41] , inhibition of coronavirus entry [42] and inhibition of amyloid assembly [43] . Hexachlorophene is also known as a glutaminase inhibitor [44] and as an inhibitor of the beta-catenin pathway [45] . It has not been previously identified as a CBS inhibitor or a H 2 S biosynthesis inhibitor, even though it has already been shown to inhibit tumor cell proliferation in vitro; this effect was attributed to its inhibitory effect on the catenin pathway [46] . Even though hexachlorophene inhibits HCT116 proliferation at fairly low concentrations (10 M), based on the history and the toxicological profile of the compound we do not believe that therapeutic repurposing of this compound as a CBS inhibitor is a realistic option.\n\nTannic acid (2,3-dihydroxy-5-({[(2R,3R,4S,5R,6R)-3,4,5,6-tetrakis({3,4-dihydroxy-5-[(3,4,5trihydroxyphenyl)carbonyloxy]phenyl}carbonyloxy)oxan-2yl]methoxy}carbonyl)phenyl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate) is a commercial form of tannin, which is a common natural polyphenol product of various plants (Tara pods, gallnuts, Sicilian Sumac leaves). Tannic acid is used in certain food industries, and albumin tannate was used in the 60 s and 70 s as an antidiarrheal agent [47] [48] [49] . Thorson and colleagues have previously identified another polyphenol, rutin, as a CBS inhibitor [26] ; to our knowledge this is the first report to identify tannic acid as a CBS inhibitor. Although the polyphenolic nature of tannic acid suggested non-specific (e.g. potential H 2 S scavenging) properties of various polyphenols, tannic acid did not interfere with the AzMc responses induced by the H 2 S donor compound GYY4137. Interestingly, tannins have been reported to inhibit bacterial H 2 S production [50] , an effect that we hypothesize may be related to its inhibitory effect of bacterial H 2 S-producing enzymes. Tannic acid exerted a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on HCT116 cell proliferation, with an IC 50 of 20 M. Multiple lines of studies have previously identified the anticancer effects of tannins, although the exact mechanism(s) have not been clearly elucidated; they range from direct cytotoxity to inhibition of various putative target enzymes including proteasomes [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . Based on the current studies, we hypothesize that inhibition of tumor CBS activity may contribute to the anticancer effects of tannins.\n\nThe next CBS inhibitor identified by our screen was aurintricarboxylic acid, which, to our knowledge, has not been previously identified as a CBS inhibitor. This compound -which has the propensity to polymerization in aqueous solution, forming a stable free radical that has been shown to inhibit various protein-nucleic acid interactions -has previously been shown to possess a number of pharmacological activities, including protease inhibition, complement inhibition, ribonuclease inhibition and neuraminidase inhibition [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] . It has also been shown to stimulate insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, AKT and ERK signaling [61] [62] [63] . The stimulation of cell proliferation by aurintricarboxylic acid observed in our experiments -similar to previously observed stimulation of cell proliferation of various cell lines by this compound [64] [65] [66] may be related to the ability of the compound to stimulate var- ious proliferative signaling pathways; we hypothesize that these actions are more predominant in HCT116 cells that any antiproliferative effects that would be expected via CBS inhibition. Although its mode of action and its diverse pharmacological effects suggest lack of specificity (and perhaps lack of in vivo utility) surprisingly, aurintricarboxylic acid is tolerated in experimental animals, and, in fact, has been shown to produce therapeutic benefits in a variety of conditions including encephalitis and sepsis [62, 63] .\n\nFinally, our screen and our follow-up work identified benserazide ((RS)-2-Amino-3-hydroxy-N-(2,3,4-trihydroxybenzyl) propanehydrazide) as a CBS inhibitor with an IC 50 of \u223c30 M. Thorson and colleagues have previously reported [26] the CBS inhibitory effect of benserazide, albeit with a lower potency (125 M). We hypothesize that the difference may be related to the aqueous instability (oxidation-prone nature) of this compound -as demonstrated in our current study as well as reported previously [35, 36] . Benserazide produced the expected features of a CBS inhibitor; similar to AOAA (as shown previously in [11, 67] ), benserazide inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation, and suppressed cancer cell bioenergetic responses. Our computer-based modeling studies have identified a predicted mode of its inhibitory action. It should be noted, nevertheless, that the extent to which benserazide suppresses the proliferation of colon cancer cells depended on the cell type studied. A significant suppression of proliferation (and, at the highest concentrations tested, some degree of cytotoxicity, as evidenced by increased LDH release) was noted in HCT116 cells (Fig. 9 ) and HT-29 cells (Fig. 15 ) that express a relatively high concentration of CBS. By comparison, in LoVo cells, which express a lower level of CBS, neither benserazide-induced antiproliferative effects, nor benserazide-induced increases in LDH release were seen (Fig. 16) . These data support the conclusion that benserazide is targeting CBS. However, we are well aware of the fact that there are many other possibilities that may explain the differential effects, including potential differences in cell uptake, or potential differences in the cellular metabolism of benserazide.\n\nBenserazide is one component of a two-component oral anti-Parkinson therapeutic combination (with the other component being L-DOPA) [68, 69] . The original mode of benserazide's mode of action is to inhibit the peripheral DOPA decarboxylase (which, similar to CBS, is a PLP-dependent enzyme) [68, 69] . A detailed review of the published pharmacological and toxicological literature from the 70 s [70, 71] -mainly generated by pharmacologists at Hoffman LaRoche, the original producer of Madopar \u00ae Roche (1 component benserazide + 4 component L-DOPA) -reveals that benserazide has >35% oral bioavailability in rats and \u223c70% oral bioavailability in humans. At 1-4 h after oral administration of a single dose of 50 mg radiolabeled benserazide, human plasma concentrations were established in the range of 0.5-1 g/ml (i.e. 2-4 M). In rats, a single dose of 10 mg radiolabeled benserazide produced plasma levels of 1-10 g/ml (i.e. 4-40 M) [70, 71] . Similar to many examples in the literature, the plasma concentrations of drugs targeting intracellular enzymes (especially when the mode of action is irreversible binding to the enzyme, as is the case for benserazide, which binds to the PLP prosthetic group of its targets) do not necessarily predict tissue levels or the degree of inhibition of its intracellular target. Importantly, in rat studies [70, 71] , benserazide concentrations in the kidney and the liver were 2-3fold higher than plasma concentrations at 1-12 h after single dose administration. In addition to benserazide itself, our data indicate that its major metabolite 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzylhydrazine (THBH) also acts as a CBS inhibitor and colon cancer cell antiproliferative agent (Fig. 12) . Based on the above pharmacokinetic considerations, we predict that tumor tissue concentrations comparable to the antiproliferative concentrations of benserazide (as well as its metabolite) may be achievable in vivo, which may open the potential for therapeutic repurposing of the compound.\n\nOne way to predict target engagement is to survey the literature for biochemical alterations (potential biomarkers) after benserazide administration that may suggest CBS inhibition. We found no published studies in the literature on the effect of benserazide on H 2 S production or H 2 S levels. Therefore, we focused on secondary biomarkers. Since liver CBS plays a physiological role in plasma homocysteine metabolism [15] , we predicted that CBS target engagement by benserazide in humans may induce hyperhomocysteinemia. Indeed, a recent study shows that benserazide in Parkinson's patients produces a \u223c15% increase in plasma homocysteine levels [72] , which we interpret as the inactivation of CBS by benserazide, followed by the accumulation of its substrate, homocysteine in the circulation. Further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies are needed to determine the feasibility of benserazide as a potentially repurposable agent for the experimental therapy of cancer.\n\nOne side-finding of the current work was the \"re-rediscovery\" of the inhibitory effect of copper ions on CBS activity; a finding that has already been described in 1958 by Matsuo and Greenberg [36] , and re-discovered by the Kraus group in 2005 [37] . Although the potency of copper was found to be remarkable -in fact, copper is technically the most potent CBS inhibitor \"compound\" known to date -free copper ions did not exert antiproliferative effects in HCT116 cells, probably due to limited cell uptake, as well as the high ability of cells to sequester and neutralize any free copper ions [73, 74] . Future work is needed to determine whether the ability of copper to inhibit CBS may be useful in the context of therapeutic CBS inhibition.\n\nAnother side finding of the current project was the discovery that the second reference CBS inhibitor compound, NSC67078 [27] potently inhibits not only the CBS-induced AzMC fluorescence response, but also the H 2 S donor GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence, suggesting that at least part of the inhibition of the CBS-induced signal is unrelated to direct inhibition of the cat- Bioenergetic parameters were normalized to protein content.

Nevertheless, NSC67078 was found to be the most potent inhibitor of HCT116 cell proliferation amongst all the molecules evaluated in the current project. Given the fact, however, that this compound is known as a highly potent inhibitor of the \u2424-catenin pathway [75, 76] , as well as a SIRT1/2 inhibitor [77] , we hypothesize that \u2424-catenin inhibition and SIRT inhibition significantly contributes to its potent inhibitory effect on cancer cell proliferation in vitro; further work is needed to dissect the various possible mechanisms (\u2424-catenin inhibition, SIRT inhibition, CBS inhibition, perhaps other actions as well) in its anti-proliferative actions.\n\nA third side-finding of the current studies demonstrates that none of the known PLP-dependent enzyme inhibitors exerted potent inhibitory effects on CBS. Prior studies have demonstrated that PAG (a PLP-dependent inhibitor of CSE) is not an inhibitor of CBS [20] . Similarly, D-cycloserine and isoniazid, two antibiotics that suppress M. tuberculosis infection via inhibition of multiple PLPdependent enzymes, failed to act as significant inhibitors of CBS activity (15-20% inhibition at 1 mM) [20] . Based on these data, we conclude that PLP-dependent enzyme inhibition is not a sufficient criterion for CBS inhibition.\n\nTaken together, the current work characterized the potency, selectivity and the antiproliferative and bioenergetic actions of benserazide, one of the CBS inhibitors identified through in vitro screening. Based on the findings reported in the current article, we conclude that benserazide may be potentially suitable for repur-posing for the treatment of colorectal cancers, although further pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and preclinical animal studies are necessary.\n\nC.C., A.P., M.H. and C.S are shareholders and/or officers of CBS Therapeutics Inc., a UTMB spin-off company involved in research and development of CBS inhibitors for the therapy of cancer.
