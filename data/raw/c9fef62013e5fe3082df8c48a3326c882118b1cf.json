{"title": "PERK and XBP1 differentially regulate CXCL10 and CCL2 production HHS Public Access", "body": "Vision is the most important sense for human beings and almost 30% of the sensory input to the brain is generated from the retina (Jayakody et al., 2015) . Photoreceptors are specialized neurons in the retina. Their biological function is mainly recognized to convert light into neural signals during visual perception. Loss of photoreceptors during retinal degenerative diseases such as retinal detachment, retinitis pigmentosa, age-related macular degeneration and others is a leading cause of blindness in developed countries (Jayakody et al., 2015; Murakami et al., 2013) . Although inflammation is well appreciated to play a key role in the pathogenesis of these diseases, the involvement of photoreceptors in inflammatory reactions is largely unknown. Two recent papers showing that photoreceptors are the major source of superoxide in diabetic retinopathy and elimination of photoreceptors prevents retinal inflammation and capillary degeneration indeed suggest photoreceptors can communicate with non-adjacent cells in the retina though undefined mechanisms (Du et al., 2015; Du et al., 2013) .\n\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an intracellular organelle for protein synthesis, folding and trafficking. When ER function is perturbed by various cellular stressors, protein assembly is disturbed, resulting in accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins in the ER, which triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) (Kim et al., 2008; Malhotra and Kaufman, 2007; Zhang et al., 2015) . The UPR consists of three pathways mediated by PKRlike ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme \u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). These proteins normally exist in an inactive state by binding to ER chaperone GRP78 (78-kDa glucose-regulated/binding immunoglobulin protein). During ER stress, GRP78 binds to misfolded proteins and PERK, IRE1 and ATF6 are released. PERK undergoes autophosphorylation and activation. Activated PERK phosphorylates and inactivates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), leading to the attenuation of protein translation and subsequent reduction of protein load in the ER. On the other hand, phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 induces the translation of certain mRNAs, such as the mRNA encoding the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which mediates the transcription of genes involved in ER homeostasis, anti-oxidative stress and amino-acid metabolism (Kim et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2004) . PERK is the only UPR branch that modulates protein synthesis as an adaptive response. However, prolonged PERK activity is correlated with the progression of chronic diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes, and blockade of PERK has been shown to be beneficial in a variety of disease contexts (Bell et al., 2016) . In contrast to PERK, spliced X-box binding protein-1 (XBP1s), which is generated by splicing an intron from XBP1 by activated IRE1\u03b1, inhibits inflammation and oxidative stress, and protects neuronal cells from injuries (Casas-Tinto et al., 2011; Hollien and Weissman, 2006; Huang et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2008; Li et al., 2011; Valdes et al., 2014) .\n\nIn retinal diseases, ER stress is implicated in diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma given that ER stress markers are upregulated in these diseases and modulation of ER stress pathways substantially reduces vascular inflammation, leakage and retinal ganglion cell degeneration Doh et al.; Hu et al., 2012; Ito et al.; Li et al., 2009; Makino et al., 2013) . The role of ER stress in photoreceptor degenerative diseases is also appreciated. Mutations within the rhodopsin gene cause rhodopsin misfolding, ER stress and UPR, which promotes photoreceptor cell death in autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, whereas the alleviation of ER stress with GRP78 overexpression prevents photoreceptor cell death and preserves its function (Gorbatyuk et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2012; Shinde et al., 2012) . In spite of the above progresses, the mechanisms of ER stress-induced photoreceptor degeneration are mainly linked to its activation of apoptotic pathways. Although inflammation is a key player in retinal degenerative diseases and ER stress is a well-known inducer of inflammation, it is unclear whether ER stress regulates inflammatory reactions in photoreceptors.\n\nChemokines are a group of peptides (8-15kD) that have an essential role in inflammation by mediating leukocyte recruitment and activation (Chen et al., 2004; Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2012) . Inflammatory chemokine CCL2, formerly named monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, functions mainly as chemoattractant to recruit and activate monocytes, macrophages and microglia from the blood to the site of inflammation (Charo and Taubman, 2004) , which is critical for photoreceptor degeneration in retinal detachment, age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa and diabetic retinopathy (Ambati et al., 2003; Guo et al., 2012; Nakazawa et al., 2007; Rangasamy et al., 2014) . CXCL10 is another key chemokine to attract monocytes, macrophages, microglia and T cells. It is involved in inflammation and neuronal injury in retinal ischemia reperfusion, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury (Balashov et al., 1999; Glaser et al., 2006; Ha et al., 2015; Krauthausen et al., 2015) . CXCL10 level is also increased in multiple models of photoreceptor degenerative diseases (Detrick et al., 2008; Ricker et al., 2010; Rutar et al., 2015) . In the present study, we determined whether ER stress induces CCL2 and CXCL10 expression in photoreceptor cells and investigated the potential mechanisms of ER stressinduced CCL2 and CXCL10 expression.\n\nMouse photoreceptor cell line 661W (Krishnamoorthy et al., 1999; Tan et al., 2004 ) was a generous gift from Dr. Muayyad AI-Ubaidi (Department of Cell Biology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modification of Eagle's Medium (DMEM) (Corning, Corning, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Logan, Utah), 1% Antibioticantimycotic (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), 40 \u03bcg/L Hydrocortisone 21hemisuccinate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 40 \u03bcg/L progesterone (Sigma-Aldrich), 32 mg/L putrescine (Sigma-Aldrich), and 40 \u03bcl/L \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were grown with humidified 5% CO 2 at 37\u00b0C. When appropriate, cells were starved with serum free DMEM with 0.1% BSA (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) overnight. All inhibitors were performed 30 minutes before thapsigargin (TG) (Tocris Bioscience, Minneapolis, MN) treatment. In diabetes-related studies, 661W cells were starved in DMEM supplemented with 0.2% FBS overnight and then treated with 200 \u03bcg/ml control BSA or AGE (Biovison, Milpitas, CA) for 1-24 hours; or cells were starved in DMEM containing 2% FBS overnight and then treated with 5.5 mM glucose (normal glucose, NG) or 30 mM glucose (high glucose, HG) for 48 hours.\n\nPlasmids including pSuper-puro/luciferase-shRNA control, pSuper-puro-U6-XBP1-shRNA (target sequence 5\u2032-GGA TTC ATG AAT GGC CCT TA-3\u2032), and pSuper-puro-PERK-shRNA (target sequence 5\u2032-AGT GGA AAG CTG AGG TAT A-3\u2032) were constructed and 661W cells stably expressing the above plasmids were generated by retroviral transduction as described previously (Sha et al., 2009) . Briefly, phoenix cells were transfected with plasmid of interest and VSVG at 2:1 ratio overnight and then replaced with fresh culture media. Media containing retroviruses were harvested 48 hours after transfection and used to transduce 661W cells in the presence of 6 \u03bcg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 hours. Stable cell lines were selected in the presence of 1 \u03bcg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich).\n\nSupernatants from cells were collected 24 hours after treatment with vehicle, TG or AGE, or 48 hours after high glucose treatment. The concentrations of CXCL10 and CCL2 in cell-free supernatants were measured with Mouse CXCL10/IP-10/CRG-2 or CCL2 Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) following the manufacturer's instructions and normalized to total protein of the cell lysates. Protein concentration of the cell lysates was determined by a BCA assay (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL). The optical density (OD) of samples was detected with Synergy \u2122 H1 microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT).\n\nFor XBP1 blotting, nuclei were extracted using CelLytic \u2122 NuCLEAR \u2122 Extraction Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein from cells or nuclei were dissolved in 1x SDS loading buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE gels as described previously (Ameri et al., 2014) . Subsequently, proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), probed with primary and secondary antibodies, and detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The primary antibodies included the following: Phospho-PERK (Thr980), PERK, Phospho-NF-\u03baB RelA (Ser 468), NF-\u03baB, I\u03baB\u03b1, JAK1 and Phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705) from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); phospho-JAK1 (Thy1022/Tyr1023) from EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA); STAT3 from BD biosciences (San Jose, CA); XBP1 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-\u03b1-Tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) and rabbit monoclonal anti-Lamin B1 (Cell Signaling Technology) were used as loading controls. Densitometry analysis was conducted using ImageJ software.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD) according to the manufacturers' recommendations. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Life Technologies). Quantitative PCR was performed using a StepOne PCR system (Life Technologies) and the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix kit (Life Technologies). Primer sequences for mouse transcripts were as follows: HPRT For-5\u2032-GAA AGA CTT GCT CGA GAT GTC ATG-3\u2032; HPRT Rev-5\u2032-CAC ACA GAG GGC CAC AAT GT-3\u2032; CXCL10 For-5\u2032-CAT CCC TGC GAG CCT ATC C-3\u2032; CXCL10 Rev-5\u2032-CAT CTC TGC TCA TCA TTC TTT TTC A-3\u2032; CCL2 For-5\u2032-GGC TCA GCC AGA TGC AGT TAA-3\u2032; CCL2 Rev-5\u2032-CCT ACT CAT TGG GAT CAT CTT GCT-3\u2032; GRP78 For-5\u2032-ACT TGG GGA CCA CCT ATT CCT-3\u2032; GRP78 Rev-5\u2032-ATC GCC AAT CAG ACG CTC C-3\u2032; XBP1s For-5\u2032-TGC TGA GTC CGC AGC AGG TG-3\u2032; XBP1s Rev-5\u2032-GCT GGC AGG CTC TGG GGA AG-3\u2032; ATF4 For-5\u2032-TCC TGA ACA GCG AAG TGT TG-3\u2032; ATF4 Rev-5\u2032-ACC CAT GAG GTT TCA AGT GC-3\u2032; CHOP For-5\u2032-CTG GAA GCC TGG TAT GAG GAT-3\u2032; CHOP Rev-5\u2032-CAG GGT CAA GAG TAG TGA AGG T-3\u2032; ATF6 For-5\u2032-TGC CTT GGG AGT CAG ACC TAT-3\u2032; ATF6 Rev-5\u2032-GCT GAG TTG AAG AAC ACG AGT C-3\u2032. Data obtained from RT-qPCR reaction was analyzed by the \u0394\u0394CT method with HPRT used as the reference gene for normalization.\n\nCells were seeded at a density of 1x10 4 cells/well in 96-well plates. The following day, cells were starved in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA overnight and then treated with vehicle (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich) or 0.01 \u03bcM TG for 24 hours. After treatment, 20 \u03bcl of 5 mg/ml 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) was added to each well and plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C cell culture incubator for 1 hour. After media were sucked off, 100 \u03bcl of DMSO was added to each well and plates were shaken at room temperature for 10 minutes to dissolve intracellular MTT formazan crystals, followed by measurement of absorbance at 540 nm. Value of the blank wells with media only was deducted from the measured value.\n\nAll experiments were repeated at least three times. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error of mean (SEM) of all determinations. Group differences were evaluated with one-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc Student's t test. Results were considered significant at P < 0.05.\n\nBecause of the difficulty of isolation and culture of primary photoreceptor cells, a photoreceptor cell line 661W has been widely used to study mechanisms of photoreceptor dysfunction and degeneration, and develop strategies to protect photoreceptors in a variety of conditions such as light damage, retinitis pigmentosa, diabetic retinopathy, retinal dystrophy, and retinal detachment (Aslanidis et al., 2015; Besirli et al., 2012; Byrne et al., 2016; Du et al., 2015; Izawa et al., 2016; Jackson et al., 2016; Krishnamoorthy et al., 1999; Lee et al., 2016; Rapp et al., 2014; Scholz et al., 2015; Shi et al., 2015; Tan et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2014) . To determine whether photoreceptor cells can produce chemokines CXCL10 and CCL2 under stress conditions, we treated 661W cells with thapsigargin (TG), which potently induces ER stress at 0.01-0.1 \u03bcM (Bartolome et al., 2012; Hamamura and Yokota, 2007) and is widely used to study ER stress-induced cellular responses (Bartolome et al., 2012; Hamamura and Yokota, 2007; Kim et al., 2008) . We treated cells with TG for different time periods and assessed the expression of ER stress-related genes (GRP78, ATF4, CHOP, XBP1s and ATF6) as well as CXCL10 and CCL2. As shown in Figure 1A -E, TG treatment rapidly induced potent upregulation of GRP78, ATF4, CHOP, XBP1s and ATF6. Since the expression of ER stress-related genes is used as a marker of ER stress (Dey et al., 2010; Kennedy et al., 2015; Namba et al., 2007) , these results indicate a successful induction of ER stress in our experimental condition. Associated with the increase of ER stress, mRNAs of CXCL10 and CCL2 were robustly increased in a time-dependent manner and reached peak expression at 3 to 6 hours after TG treatment ( Figure 1F and 1G). Since TG induced maximal increases in CXCL10 and CCL2 at 6 hours after TG treatment, this time point was selected for further experiments when measuring mRNA expression of CXCL10 and CCL2. Moreover, the protein levels of CXCL10 and CCL2 in conditioned medium were examined by ELISA at 24 hours after treatment. Our data clearly showed that TG treatment significantly increased CXCL10 and CCL2 protein production by 2.2-fold and 1.7-fold, respectively ( Fig. 1H and 1I ). Therefore, photoreceptor cells are able to produce CXCL10 and CCL2 in response to ER stress.\n\nTo validate the role of ER stress in TG-induced CXCL10 and CCL2 expression, 661W cells were treated with 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) which is a chemical chaperone and has been commonly used to attenuate ER stress (Ishimura et al., 2014; Kawasaki et al., 2012; Ozcan et al., 2006) . 4-PBA treatment reduced TG-induced CXCL10 and CCL2 mRNA expression by 49% and 58%, respectively ( Fig. 2A and 2B) , which is consistent with the partial decreases of ER stress as indicated by reduction of TG-induced expression of GRP78, ATF4, CHOP, XBP1s and ATF6 ( Fig. 2C-2G ). These results indicate that ER stress mediates CXCL10 and CCL2 expression at the level of gene transcription. Correspondingly, the protein levels of CXCL10 and CCL2 were reduced after 4-PBA treatment (Supplemental Fig. 1A and 1B).\n\nPERK is the only unfolded protein response (UPR) branch that modulates protein synthesis as an adaptive response and chronic PERK activation is linked to neurodegenerative diseases (Bell et al., 2016) . CXCL10 and CCL2 also play an important role in neurodegeneration, so we presumed that PERK may be activated at earlier time point (e.g. 0-3 hours after TG treatment) than maximal CXCL10 and CCL2 expression was induced, and be potentially involved in ER stress-induced CXCL10 and CCL2 expression. Phosphorylation of PERK, causing PERK to migrate slower on SDS-PAGE gels, can be used as a marker for its activation status (Qi et al., 2011) . Treatment of 661W cells with TG resulted in PERK mobility shift as shown in Western bot (Fig. 3A, upper panel) . The faster-migrated protein indicated the unphosphorylated form of PERK, whereas the slower-migrated forms corresponded to phosphorylated PERK. The phosphorylation status of the slower-migrated PERK proteins was further confirmed by blotting with a specific antibody which only recognizes phosphorylated PERK (Thr980) (Fig. 3A, middle panel) . These data indicate that TG treatment robustly induces PERK activation in 661W cells.\n\nTo determine the role of PERK in CXCL10 and CCL2 expression, we knocked down PERK expression with shRNA. As shown in Figure 3B , there was a 48% reduction of PERK protein in cells transfected with PERK shRNA. Associated with a decrease in PERK expression, TG-induced CXCL10 and CCL2 expression was reduced by 30% and 60% at mRNA level, respectively ( Fig. 3C and 3D) . Consistently, PERK deletion moderately attenuated TG-induced secretion of CXCL10 and CCL2 (Supplemental Fig. 1C and 1D ). To determine whether the effect of PERK knockdown was mediated by a consequent reduction of ER stress, we analyzed the expression of ER stress-related genes. We did not observe any difference in GRP78 and ATF6 expression between cells transfected with control shRNA and PERK shRNA ( Fig. 3E and 3F ). However, PERK knockdown affected its downstream ATF4/CHOP pathway. It reduced CHOP expression at basal level ( Fig. 3G ) and reduced ATF4 expression in the absence or presence of TG (Fig. 3H) . These results indicate that PERK plays a key role in ER stress-induced CXCL10 and CCL2 expression, and its effect is not due to reduction of ER stress since GRP78 and ATF6 expression was not altered by PERK shRNA.\n\nIn contrast to PERK activation, transcription factor XBP1, activated by IRE1\u03b1-mediated splicing, is a major protective molecule in the UPR when cells are under ER stress (Kim et al., 2008) . TG treatment increased XBP1s expression (Fig. 4A) , indicating this pathway is operative. To investigate the role of XBP1 in ER stress-induced CXCL10 and CCL2 expression, we knocked down XBP1 with shRNA construct, which markedly decreased XBP1s protein level after either vehicle or TG treatment by 35% and 58%, respectively (Fig.  4A) . Knockdown of XBP1 resulted in increases of CXCL10 and CCL2 expression at basal level or after TG treatment (Fig. 4B, 4C, Supplemental Fig. 1C and 1D) . Expression of GRP78, ATF4 and ATF6 was not altered by XBP1 shRNA (Fig. 4D, 4E and 4F ). However, TG-induced CHOP expression was moderately boosted by XBP1 knockdown (Fig. 4G ).\n\nSince XBP1s is generated by splicing an intron from XBP1 by activated IRE1\u03b1, we further tested whether inhibition of IRE1\u03b1 will duplicate the effects of XBP1 knockdown. We treated 661W cells with IRE1\u03b1 specific inhibitor 4\u03bc8C (Ma et al., 2016) , and determined CXCL10 and CCL2 expression. Similar to XBP1 knockdown, 4\u03bc8C increased CXCL10 and CCL2 expression in vehicle-treated cells (Supplemental Fig. 2A and 2B) . However, in spite of dramatically reducing TG-induced XBP1s expression (Supplemental Fig. 2C ), 4\u03bc8C did not enhance CXCL10 expression and only moderately boosted CCL2 level after TG treatment (Supplemental Fig. 2A and 2B) . Moreover, 4\u03bc8C treatment reduced TG-induced GRP78 and CHOP expression (Supplemental Fig. 2D and 2E) . These results are different from the effects of XBP1 knockdown, suggesting that XBP1s is not the only molecule that mediates the effect of IRE1\u03b1 in photoreceptor cells during ER stress.\n\nOverall, these studies indicate that PERK and XBP1 are involved in ER stress-induced CXCL10 and CCL2 expression. PERK positively regulates CXCL10 and CCL2 expression whereas XBP1 negatively regulates their expression.\n\nThe NF-\u03baB family of transcription factors, regulates numerous genes related to inflammation and immune responses (Sanz et al., 2010) . It is composed of five members: p50, p52, RelA (p65), c-Rel and RelB, and exists as homo-or hetero-dimers, among which the RelA/p50 dimer is most abundant (Sanz et al., 2010) . NF-\u03baB dimers are bound to an inhibitory protein I\u03baB (e.g. I\u03baB\u03b1). Upon stimulation, I\u03baB is phosphorylated and degraded, freeing NF-\u03baB dimers to translocate to the nucleus and regulate the expression of many inflammatory genes. The transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB is further enhanced when RelA is phosphorylated (Viatour et al., 2005) . The promoters of CXCL10 and CCL2 contain NF-\u03baB binding sites and their expressions are regulated by NF-\u03baB during pathogen infection or inflammatory cytokine stimulation (Brownell et al., 2014; Spurrell et al., 2005; Xing and Remick, 2007) , so we investigated whether NF-\u03baB signaling mediates PERK and XBP1modulated CXCL10 and CCL2 expression. We analyzed RelA phosphorylation and I\u03baB\u03b1 level in TG-treated 661W cells. In cells transfected with control shRNA, there was significant increase in RelA phosphorylation and decrease in I\u03baB\u03b1 expression after TG treatment. On the other hand, in cells transfected with PERK shRNA, TG treatment only slightly increased RelA phosphorylation and decreased I\u03baB\u03b1 expression (Fig. 5A) , indicating TG-induced NF-\u03baB activation is attenuated by PERK deletion. In contrast, XBP1 knockdown further enhanced TG-induced RelA phosphorylation with decreased I\u03baB\u03b1, reflecting XBP1 deletion promoted NF-\u03baB activation (Fig. 5B) . To examine the role of NF-\u03baB in TG-induced CXCL10 and CCL2 expression, we treated cells with PDTC, a NF-\u03baB inhibitor. PDTC treatment partially blocked TG-induced CXCL10 expression ( Fig. 5C and Supplemental Fig. 1A ) but dramatically attenuated TG-induced CCL2 expression ( Fig. 5D and Supplemental Fig. 1B ). GRP78 expression was not affected by NF-\u03baB inhibition (Fig.  5E ). Overall, these data suggest that ER stress induces CXCL10 and CCL2 expression by activating the NF-\u03baB pathway, which is positively regulated by PERK and negatively regulated by XBP1.\n\nSince NF-\u03baB inhibitor only partially blocked TG-induced CXCL10 expression, we reasoned other transcriptional factors might also be involved in this process. The Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) proteins are transcription factors that regulate expression of genes related with development and immune system. Both CXCL10 and CCL2 genes contain STAT binding sites and their expression is regulated by STAT1 and STAT3 (Kok et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2011) . Thus we investigated whether STAT1 and STAT3 were involved in PERK and XBP1-regulated CXCL10 and CCL2 expression. We did not detect STAT1 phosphorylation when cells were treated with TG (data not shown). On the other hand, after TG treatment, STAT3 phosphorylation was prominently increased in cells transfected with control shRNA but not in cells with PERK shRNA, indicating that TGinduced STAT3 phosphorylation is dependent on PERK during UPR (Fig. 6A) . The increased STAT3 phosphorylation may be caused by activation of its upstream kinases JAK1 and JAK2. Therefore we analyzed JAK1 and JAK2 phosphorylation. Our data showed that phosphorylated JAK1 (Fig. 6A ) but not JAK2 (data not shown) was significantly increased after TG treatment, exhibiting similar profile as phosphorylated STAT3, whereas PERK deletion blunted this response. In contrast, in cells with XBP1 knockdown, the phosphorylation of STAT3 and JAK1 was enhanced at the basal level and TG treatment (Fig.  6B) . To further assess the involvement of STAT3 in ER stress-induced CXCL10 and CCL2 expression, we blocked STAT3 activation with a STAT1/3 inhibitor (Stattic) and measured CXCL10 and CCL2 gene expression and secretion. TG-induced CXCL10 and CCL2 expression was significantly reduced by Stattic ( Fig. 6C and 6D , and Supplemental Fig. 1A and 1B), without altering GRP78 expression (Fig. 6E) . These data suggest that TG induces CXCL10 and CCL2 expression via the activation of STAT3. PERK is a positive regulator of STAT3 activation while XBP1 is a negative regulator of this pathway. ER stress also regulates cell survival. However blocking PERK or STAT3 did not affect TG-induced decrease in cell viability though XBP1 knockdown slightly accelerated TG-induced cell loss (Supplemental Fig. 3) , suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in ER stressinduced cytokine expression and cell death.\n\nAfter demonstrating that PERK and XBP1 differentially regulate ER stress activator-induced CXCL10 and CCL2 production in 661W cells, we further investigated whether such mechanism is operative when cells were treated with diabetes-related conditions. AGE is formed by protein glycation during hyperglycemia and plays an important role in diabetic retinopathy and other complications (Singh et al., 2014) . Our results revealed that AGE induced CXCL10 and CCL2 expression at transcription level and mRNAs of CXCL10 and CCL2 reached peak expression at 12 hours after AGE treatment ( Fig. 7A and 7B ). AGE treatment also induced ER stress as indicated by upregulation of PERK phosphorylation, and increased expression of XBP1s, GRP78, ATF4, CHOP and ATF6 (Fig. 7C, 7D and Supplemental Fig. 4 ) though its effects were much weaker than those induced by TG. Similarly, AGE-induced CXCL10 and CCL2 gene expression and protein secretion were blocked by knockdown of PERK while enhanced by knockdown of XBP1 (Fig. 7E-7H) . As hyperglycemia is a major cause of diabetic retinopathy, we further determined CXCL10 and CCL2 in conditioned medium from high glucose-treated photoreceptors and found that PERK and XBP1 regulated CXCL10 and CCL2 levels similar to their actions in TG-or AGE-treated cells (Fig. 8) . These studies indicate PERK and XBP1 also play an important role in CXCL10 and CCL2 expression in photoreceptor cells under diabetes-related conditions.\n\nPhotoreceptor dysfunction/death is a cause of many retinal degenerative diseases (Jayakody et al., 2015; Murakami et al., 2013) . Studies on photoreceptor injury are mainly focused on how stress conditions initiate intracellular signals that drive photoreceptor apoptosis, necrosis, and/or autophagic cell death (Murakami et al., 2013) . Inflammation is recognized as an important player during photoreceptor death (Ambati et al., 2003; Detrick et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2012; Murakami et al., 2013; Nakazawa et al., 2007; Ricker et al., 2010; Rutar et al., 2015) . However, it is largely unknown how photoreceptors communicate with immune cells, as photoreceptors are not considered as inflammatory cells. Extracellular exposure of phosphatidylserine, release of ATP and secretion of high-mobility group box 1 protein from dying photoreceptors have been proposed to serve as \"find-me\" signal to recruit immune cells (Murakami et al., 2013) . In this study we provide the first evidence that ER stress induces CXCL10 and CCL2 gene transcription and protein production in photoreceptor cells in a STAT3 and NF-\u03baB-dependent manner and PERK positively regulates these pathways whereas XBP1 acts oppositely. As CXCL10 and CCL2 have dominant roles in recruiting mononuclear cells during inflammation, our study suggest that photoreceptors may participate in retinal inflammation by producing chemokines during stress. This study, together with a report that photoreceptors express toll-like receptors (TLR) and produce cytokines when stimulated with TLR ligands (Singh and Kumar, 2015) , indicates that photoreceptors can function as inflammatory cells in addition to their basic role as photosensor during visual cycle.\n\nER homeostasis is tightly monitored by the unfolded protein response (UPR) which controls the ER-to-nucleus signaling cascades (Ron and Walter, 2007) . Mild ER stress occurs at physiological conditions and is important for cells to re-establish ER homeostasis and maintain normal cell function (Yang et al., 2010) . Nevertheless, excessive ER stress causes cell death, tissue damage and leads to diseases. In the retina, ER stress has been linked to retinal neuronal and vascular degeneration in diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and photoreceptor degeneration Doh et al.; Gorbatyuk et al., 2010; Ha et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2012; Ito et al.; Kang et al., 2012; Li et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2010; Makino et al., 2013; Shinde et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2013) . The contradictory effects of ER stress in cell fates (survival vs. death) are dictated by the balance among UPR branches and their downstream adaptive and cytotoxic pathways (Bell et al., 2016) . When PERK is activated, it phosphorylates eIF2\u03b1, which reduces protein synthesis to prevent further influx of nascent polypeptides into the ER while enhancing the translation of certain mRNAs, such as the mRNA encoding ATF4 (Teske et al., 2011) . ATF4, as a transcription factor, mediates transcription of genes involved in cell recovery and adaptation (Bell et al., 2016) . However, when PERK is chronically activated, it causes neuronal cell dysfunction and apoptosis because of chronic attenuation of protein translation (Bell et al., 2016) . In the meanwhile, sustained ATF4 expression activates apoptotic pathways (Bell et al., 2016) . Unlike the dual functionality of PERK, upregulation of spliced XBP1 in UPR is neuroprotective as it alleviates ER stress by inducing expression of ER chaperones and ER-associated degradation components, and facilitates lipid synthesis and ER biogenesis pathways (Bell et al., 2016; Casas-Tinto et al., 2011) . Spliced XBP1 also enhances cell survival by inducing the expression of molecules for anti-oxidant defense. Overall, the effects of PERK and XBP1 in cell survival and death are usually linked to their modulation of intracellular apoptotic pathways. In this study, we found that PERK and XBP1 differentially regulate the production of CXCL10 and CCL2 in photoreceptors. PERK is a positive regulator of ER stress-induced expression of these two cytokines while XBP1 negatively regulates their expression. Given that CXCL10 and CCL2 play important roles in inflammation which is critically involved in neuronal injury, our study suggests that the differential regulation of CXCL10 and CCL2 expression by PERK and XBP1 may also participate in their contradictory effects in neuronal cell survival.\n\nER stress-induced inflammation has been linked to many diseases (Garg et al., 2012) . Activated PERK preferably induces translation of selective mRNAs including ATF4, leading to ATF4-dependent upregulation of CHOP. As a transcription factor, ATF4 regulates expression of stress-response genes directly by binding to the promotor region of these genes or interacting with other transcription factors. In monocytes/macrophages, ATF4 exerts its proinflammatory effects through regulating NF-\u03baB activation, activating the promoter of inflammatory gene (Iwasaki et al., 2014) or binding to transcription factors such as c-Jun . In Muller cells, hyperglycemia-and hypoxia-induced ATF4 activation leads to upregulation of inflammatory genes via its crosstalk with hypoxiainducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (Zhong et al., 2012) . In retinal endothelial cells, ATF4 mediates hyperglycemia-induced endothelial inflammation and retinal vascular leakage through activation of STAT3 . Overall, the role of ATF4 in inducing inflammation is generally appreciated though specific pathways by which ATF4 regulates inflammatory molecule expression may differ from cell types and stimuli applied. CHOP, downstream ATF4, also activates NF-\u03baB or inflammasome pathways by inducing IRAK2 and caspase 11 expression (Endo et al., 2006; Willy et al., 2015) . Our study represents the first one to investigate ER stress-induced inflammation in photoreceptor cells. We demonstrated that PERK induces CXCL10 and CCL2 expression by activation of NF-\u03baB and STAT3. Considering the critical role of ATF4 in inflammation, it is likely that PERK may induce NF-\u03baB and STAT3 activation through ATF4 or ATF4/CHOP. However, other mechanisms could be operative as well. PERK, as a Ser/Thr protein kinase activated after dimerization and autophosphorylation (Bell et al., 2016) , may phosphorylate and activate positive regulators of the NF-\u03baB and STAT3 pathways. As a result, knockdown of PERK resulted in decreased phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB RelA and JAK1/STAT3. The PERK/ eIF2\u03b1 pathway may also attenuate the expression of proteins that inhibit activation or transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB and STAT3. This notion has been preliminarily supported by our data that the total level of I\u03baB\u03b1, a protein that binds to NF-\u03baB and inhibits its activation, is markedly increased after PERK knockdown.\n\nOther than the PERK/eIF2\u03b1/ATF4/CHOP pathway, the IRE1\u03b1/XBP1s branch is also involved in inflammatory reactions. As a transcription factor, XBP1 binds the promoters of genes encoding inflammatory mediators and is required for optimal and sustained production of proinflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide-treated macrophages (Martinon et al., 2010) . Our studies, however, identified that XBP1 negatively regulates CXCL10 and CCL2 expression by inhibiting NF-\u03baB and STAT3 activation. Therefore, XBP1 may exert different effects on inflammation dependent on cellular and environmental contexts. XBP1s is a negative regulator of IRE1 activation. Loss of XBP1 results in IRE1 hyperactivation (Kaser et al., 2008) which may interact with and activate TRAF2 (Urano et al., 2000) and lead to TRAF2-dependent activation of NF-\u03baB (Kaneko et al., 2003) and JNK/STAT3 signaling (Mao et al., 2016; Prause et al., 2016; Urano et al., 2000) . Alternatively, as a transcription factor, XBP1 may negatively regulate NF-\u03baB and JAK1/ STAT3 activation by inducing the expression of molecules (e.g. phosphatases) that can inactivate NF-\u03baB and JAK1/STAT3. It has been shown that XBP1s inhibits PI3K/Akt pathway through XBP1-dependent expression of SKIP, a PIP3 phosphatase (Ijuin et al., 2016) . Of interest, although XBP1 is a major downstream substrate for IRE1\u03b1, IRE1\u03b1 inhibition did not duplicate the effects of XBP1 knockdown. In addition to splicing XBP1 mRNA, IRE1\u03b1 cleaves other ER-located mRNAs through regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) (Ma et al., 2016; Maurel et al., 2014) and regulates protein expression by cleavage of miRNA (Heindryckx et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2016) . The difference between IRE1\u03b1 inhibition and XBP1 knockdown suggests that other downstream targets of IRE1\u03b1 are also involved in TG-induced CXCL10 and CCL2 expression.\n\nWhile precise mechanisms by which PERK and XBP1 regulate NF-\u03baB and STAT3 activation in photoreceptor cells during ER stress remain to be elucidated, our findings that ER stress induces CXCL10 and CCL2 expression by activating NF-\u03baB and STAT3 suggest that blocking the activation of these two transcription factors may be useful to alleviate ER stress-induced inflammation and protect photoreceptor damage. Interestingly, although CXCL10 and CCL2 expression is regulated by both NF-\u03baB and STAT3, STAT3 plays a predominant role in CXCL10 expression while NF-\u03baB plays a larger role in CCL2 expression.\n\nOur data reveal a novel mechanism that ER stress induces CXCL10 and CCL2 via the activation of NF-\u03baB and STAT3, and PERK is a positive regulator of this process whereas XBP1 is a negative regulator (Fig. 9) . As ER stress occurs in other retinal cells such as endothelial cells and Muller cells in a variety of conditions (Li et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2015) , future studies to examine whether similar mechanisms are also operative in these cells would be important to understand ER stress-induced CXCL10 and CCL2 expression in different cellular contexts and therefore help to better control ER stress-induced retinal inflammation in retinal degenerative diseases as well as chronic diseases including diabetic retinopathy.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\nWhether photoreceptor cells can produce CCL2 and CXCL10, two important players in inflammation during stress was studied.\n\nInduction of Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in photoreceptor cells induced CXCL10 and CCL2 expression.\n\nPERK was a positive regulator while XBP1 was a negative regulator for CXCL10 and CCL2 expression.\n\nPERK and XBP1 regulates the expression of CXCL10 and CCL2 through regulating NF-\u03baB RelA and STAT3 activation.
