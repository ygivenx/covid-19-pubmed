{"title": "Supplementary Material RAN TRANSLATION AND FRAMESHIFTING AS TRANSLATIONAL CHALLENGES AT SIMPLE REPEATS OF HUMAN NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS", "body": "Each panel (a-w) shows the structure for a transcript with expanded repeats, its orientation (S-sense, AS-antisense) and the number of repeats identified in affected patients: a) DMPK/DM1, b) FMR1/FXTAS, c) ATXN8OS/SCA8, d) and e) ATXN1/SCA1, f) and g) ATXN2/SCA2, h) and i) ATXN3/SCA3, j) and k) HTT/HD, l) and m) AR/SBMA, n) and o) ATN1/DRPLA, p) and r) CACNA1A/SCA6, s) and t) JPH3/HDL2, u) and w) ZNF9/DM2. Structures were modeled in silico with RNAmetaserver or Mfold and visualized by Varna software. The modeling was performed for transcripts with 150 repeated nucleotides (50x trinucleotide and 25x hexanucleotide motifs), and, to obtain more relevant results, in two variants of the flanking sequence 200 and 100 nt each side. For figure clarity, we have shortened the hairpins formed by the expanded repeats, as well as the flanking sequence, to ~50 nt of 5' flank. In each panel (a-w) the repeats locations within the affected gene are indicated (red box). As indicated in thefigure legend, different AUG-like alternative start codons and STOP codons are marked in the sequence preceding the repeats. Potential frameshifting sites are indicated by a black line. *-Neither ATXN8 nor ATXN8OS contain a conventional ORF. Figure S3 .
