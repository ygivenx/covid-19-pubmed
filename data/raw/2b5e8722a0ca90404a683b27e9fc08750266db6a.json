{"title": "Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein Regulates Interferon- Mediated Innate Immunity", "body": "Type I interferons (IFNs) regulate diverse cellular functions by modulating the expression of a large of family of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) through the activation of the Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins (Haque and Williams, 1998; Stark et al., 1998) . ISGs subsequently influence multiple pathways involved in cell stress responses, apoptosis, and proliferation, and mediate diverse immune effects (Goh et al., 1999; Goodbourn et al., 2000) . The potent immune response elicited by IFNs is exemplified by the establishment of an antiviral state that enabled their original discovery (Isaacs et al., 1957) . This state relies on the induction and activation of numerous intrinsic *Correspondence: These authors contributed equally to this work antiviral factors, most notably the Mx GTPases, the 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate-synthetase (OAS) system, ISG15, and protein kinase R (PKR) (Sadler and Williams, 2008) . In addition, IFNs modulate distinct aspects of both innate and adaptive immunity, affecting the activities of macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, and T cells by enhancing ISG expression profiles, cell differentiation, cell trafficking, and antigen presentation. Due to the numerous effects of IFNs, they have been used therapeutically against a variety of diseases, including viral infections, immunomodulatory disorders, and hematological and solid tumors (Borden et al., 2007) . The factors determining the outcome of IFN treatment, however, are not understood and IFN therapy has had variable success. Although the essential JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway is well characterized, recent studies have revealed greater complexity in patterns of gene induction than initially envisaged (Chang et al., 2004; Tenoever et al., 2007; van Boxel-Dezaire et al., 2006) . Here we identify a novel IFN-mediated signal that leads to activation of the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) transcription factor that has fundamental consequences for the immune response.\n\nPLZF is a member of the 'BTB-POZ' (bric \u00e1 brac, tramtrack, broad complex-poxvirus zinc finger) family of transcription factors and represses genes by recruiting several different corepressor complexes. Two recent reports describe a role for PLZF in the immune response as a transcription factor that is necessary for full function of natural killer T (NKT) cells (Kovalovsky et al., 2008; Savage et al., 2008) , although the mechanisms were not investigated.\n\nHere we present evidence that the role of PLZF in the immune response is broader than described in these reports. Contrary to the previous designation of PLZF as a repressor of transcription, we show that PLZF is required for the induction of a subset of ISGs that are crucial in the ensuing immune response via the induction of the antiviral genes and other ISG functions, including NK cell activity. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of IFN-mediated immunity.\n\nTo determine the factors contributing to IFN sensitivity, two renal cancer cell lines, differing markedly in their response to IFN (Holko and Williams, 2006) , were analyzed for their ISG profiles. Higher and more persistent expression of a subset of ISGs was noted in the IFNsensitive RCC1 cells when compared with the relatively IFN-insensitive ACHN cells ( Figure  1A ). Correspondingly, RCC1 cells showed an increased IFN-mediated antiviral response ( Figure S1 ). No differences in established IFN-regulatory factors were apparent between the two cell lines (Holko and Williams, 2006) . Therefore, to account for the differential regulation of this subset of ISGs, we analyzed the promoter proximal regions (1000 bp upstream of the ATG) for features that distinguished these genes from other ISGs that were synchronous between the two cell lines. It was found that genes differentially induced by IFN\u03b1 treatment in the RCC1 cells exhibited an over-representation of DNA binding motifs for the PLZF protein (Table S1 ). Cluster analysis showed the putative PLZF-binding sites were in proximity to sites occupied by essential STAT and IFN regulatory factors (IRFs), increasing the likelihood that these motifs were biologically relevant ( Figure S2 ). To test this correlation between expression of ISGs with putative binding motifs and expression levels of the transcription factor, both cell lines were assessed for their level of PLZF by Western blot analysis. Consistent with a role for PLZF in the IFN response, the IFN-sensitive RCC1 cells expressed higher levels of PLZF than the relatively IFN-insensitive ACHN cells ( Figure 1B ). This correlation between IFN sensitivity and expression levels of PLZF was further investigated using a monocytic U937 cell line stably transformed with a tetracycline-inducible PLZF-expressing construct (U937T:PLZF45) (McConnell et al., 2003) . The ISG expression profile of U937T:PLZF45 cells with and without tetracycline and IFN\u03b1 were examined.\n\nSignificantly, PLZF expression alone resulted in the induction of a subset of ISGs and this was further enhanced by IFN\u03b1 ( Figure 1C and Table S2 ). The expression of representative ISGs was validated using real time RT-PCR ( Figure 1D ). Interestingly, an analysis of gene categories regulated by PLZF identified over-representation of immune response genes, particularly ISGs (Tables S3-5) , suggesting a particular role for PLZF in mediating the immune response.\n\nTo evaluate the contribution of PLZF to immune function, the IFN-mediated anti-viral response was measured in embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from plzf knockout mice. Remarkably, plzf -/-MEFs showed 100-fold lower IFN-mediated protection to infection with Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) than wild type MEFs (Figures 2A and S3 ). The role of PLZF in the in vivo IFNmediated anti-viral response was assessed by infectious challenge of plzf -/and wild type neonatal mice. Mice were infected with SFV at 10-times the half-maximal tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) and resistance to the virus measured as survival after infection. The survival curve of infected plzf -/mice closely parallels the wild type, with all mice of both genotypes dead by 3.5 days after infection (P>0.05). Appropriately, IFN pre-treatment of mice for 6 hours before exposure to SFV afforded significant protection to wild type mice, with 60% of infected neonates (18 of 30) surviving past 22 days. In contrast, IFN pre-treatment did not protect the plzf -/mice from SFV infection, with no survival beyond 6 days after infection ( Figure 2B ). Viral loads in the organs from plzf -/and wild type neonatal mice were measured 48 h after infection with SFV. Consistent with the survival results, viral titers in the organs of plzf -/mice, including the lung, thymus, spleen, heart and liver, were up to 1,000-fold higher than their wild type littermates ( Figure 2C ).\n\nThe observed immune impairment in plzf -/mice was not restricted to an increased susceptibility to infection by SFV. Wild type and plzf -/mice had dramatically different susceptibility to infection with the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). Intraperitoneal injection, with 500 plaque-forming unit of EMCV, of 8-10 week old mice showed wild type mice had significantly better survival over their plzf -/and littermates ( Figure 2D ). These results show that PLZF is a key component of the innate immune response and is essential for resistance to virus infection in vivo.\n\nIn order to characterize the mechanism by which PLZF elicits an anti-viral state, IFN production and ISG expression were analyzed in wild type and plzf -/mice. Notably, the serum IFN concentrations were not obviously deficient in infected plzf -/mice ( Figure 3A ). This indicated that the observed virus susceptibility is independent of IFN production. The expression profile of a number of PLZF-dependent ISGs, identified in array experiments ( Figure 1A , 1C, and Table S2 ), was investigated ex vivo and in vivo. Significantly, the induction of the antiviral gene oas1 by IFN was impaired in primary plzf -/bone marrow derived macrophages (BMMs) ( Figure 3B ). As OAS1 is an established effector for the antiviral action of IFN, specifically against SFV (Borden et al., 2007; Pestka et al., 1987) , we measured its expression in different organs following IFN treatment and SFV infection. The induction of oas1 was significantly impaired in splenocytes isolated from the plzf -/mice ( Figure 3C-E) . Similarly, the antiviral ISGs rsad2 (also termed cig5 or viperin) and ifit2 (or ifi54) were impaired in plzf -/-BMMs ( Figure 3B ) and splenocytes (data not shown), or SFV-infected organs from plzf -/mice ( Figure 3C -E) . In keeping with the specificity of the PLZF response, expression of the PLZF-independent, but IFN-regulated CCL5 (RANTES) transcript was not affected ( Figure 3B ). This data suggests that the increased susceptibility of plzf -/mice is due to a specific defect in the induction of antiviral genes.\n\nA direct comparison of PLZF-independent and -dependent genes was made by comparing the closely related ifit1 and ifit2 genes. Both IFIT1 and IFIT2 are strongly induced by IFN and virus, and are impaired in STAT1-deficient mice. These two genes are reported to have contrasting expression patterns in different tissues (Terenzi et al., 2007) . Both genes contain ISRE binding sites in their promoter, but there is no PLZF binding motif in the IFIT1 promoter. Accordingly, ifit2 induction was lost in the absence of PLZF, while ifit1 was still induced by IFN in plzf -/mice ( Figure 3F ). Furthermore, analysis of the expression of PLZF in different tissues showed a strong correlation between PLZF levels and ifit2 induction in response to IFN ( Figure 3F) . Hence, the different expression patterns of these two related ISGs likely depends upon their separate regulation by PLZF. Although, expression of IFIT1 is largely independent of PLZF, a degree of PLZF dependence is noted in the lung of mice suggesting that PLZF might still contribute indirectly to inducer-specific ISG regulation.\n\nInterestingly, measurement of CXCL10 expression in the organs following IFN treatment only, or IFN treatment and SFV infection, revealed that the induction of CXCL10 by IFN was impaired in primary plzf -/-BMMs ( Figure 3B ). CXCL10 was also significantly impaired in splenocytes, liver, and lung isolated from the SFV-infected plzf -/mice ( Figure 3C -E). CXCL10 (or IP-10) has been associated with NK cell activity and the resulting protection from virus infection (Biron et al., 1999; Thapa et al., 2008) . Therefore, an additional means by which PLZF might regulate sensitivity to virus, besides inducing direct antiviral effectors, could be due to IFN-mediated activation of NK cells via ISGs such as CXCL10. This possibility was investigated.\n\nTwo recent reports have shown that PLZF effects NK T cell activity, asserting specificity in this influence due to the limited expression of PLZF to NK T cells (Kovalovsky et al., 2008; Savage et al., 2008) . However, analysis of PLZF expression in immune cells using the human and mouse microarray database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez) revealed that PLZF was also expressed in human NK cells ( Figure S4 ). Furthermore, we demonstrated that PLZF was expressed in mouse NK cells by sorting different spleen lymphocyte populations using FACS (NK1.1 + CD3 -) followed by gene expression analysis ( Figure 4A ). This analysis shows comparatively little expression in CD3 + NK1.1 -T cells and no detectable transcript in B cells. Consequently, we investigated the effect of the loss of PLZF on NK cell function. FACS analysis of splenocytes showed there were equivalent numbers of NK cells in wild type and plzf -/mice, with NK cells constituting 2-3% of total splenocytes ( Figure 4B ). The effector function of NK cells from wild type and plzf -/mice was investigated by testing their cytolytic activity against the NK-sensitive target cell line YAC-1 Shey and Ballas, 2008) . Following treatment with poly(I:C), which activates NK cells through the IFN\u03b1 signaling pathway, plzf -/-NK cells were impaired in their ability to spontaneously lyse YAC-1 cells ( Figure 4C , top panel). Moreover, when activated in vivo with IFN\u03b1, the ability of plzf -/-NK cells to subsequently lyse YAC-1 target cells was also markedly impaired ( Figure  4C , bottom panel). These results demonstrate that PLZF is required for NK cell effector function and also suggest that PLZF may regulate the expression of target genes involved in NK cytolytic activity. As cytokine-induced activation of NK cells results in a dramatic increase in the expression of Granzyme B (GzmB), we examined the ability of poly(I:C) and IL-2 to induce GzmB protein expression in murine splenic NK cells. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with poly(I:C) or PBS, and splenic NK cells were analyzed after 24 hours for GzmB expression by FACS. Wild type spleens of poly(I:C) injected mice had a markedly higher percentage of NK cells positive for GzmB than spleens of plzf -/mice ( Figure 4D ). The reduced level of GzmB is consistent with a reduced ability to lyse target cells. Activation of NK cells in vitro with IL-2 induced equivalent amounts of GzmB in either genotype (data not shown). Therefore, the role of PLZF in the induction of GzmB is through IFN, rather than other cytokines.\n\nNext we sought to define the mechanism by which PLZF enhanced the expression of a specific subset of ISGs. Treatment of U937T:PLZF45 cells with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D suggested that the induction of selected ISGs by PLZF is a primary transcriptional event ( Figure S5 ). Promoter regions from the PLZF-regulated transcripts, rsad2 and ifit2, were fused to luciferase and activity was measured following IFN treatment. Over-expression of PLZF in RCC1 or ACHN cells produced a dose-dependent induction of the reporter promoters. This effect was further enhanced by IFN\u03b1 treatment ( Figure 5 A-C). Correspondingly, induction of the rsad2 promoter was impaired in cells with PLZF expression reduced by RNA interference ( Figure 5D ). Reporter constructs confirm the requirement to colocate ISRE and PLZF-binding sites in the promoters of PLZF-regulated ISGs ( Figure S6 ). A direct association of PLZF with the promoters of rsad2 and ifit2 was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in the RCC1 and U937T:PLZF45 cell lines. Moreover, the association of PLZF to the rsad2 and ifit2 promoters was dramatically enhanced by IFN treatment ( Figures 5E and S7 ).\n\nThe observed IFN enhanced association of PLZF with select ISG promoters could occur through direct post-translational modification of PLZF, and/or modification of transcriptional cofactors. To investigate the former possibility, PLZF was immunoprecipitated from control and IFN\u03b1-treated U937T:PLZF45 cells and the acetylation or phosphorylation state of the protein was probed by Western blot. Although acetylation has been reported to be important for DNA-binding of PLZF (Guidez et al., 2004) , no change in the acetylation state was detected (data not shown). However, PLZF was found to be phosphorylated at serine and tyrosine residues, with tyrosine phosphorylation correlating with temporal treatment with IFN ( Figure  6A ). PLZF encodes two types of conserved domain, a BTB (bric \u00e1 brac, tramtrack, broad complex-poxvirus zinc finger) domain at the N-terminus and nine repeated zinc finger domains at the C-terminus. As BTB domains have been shown to be crucial for homodimerization and protein-protein interaction (Dong et al., 1996) , we chose to focus on residues within this domain. Through alignment of the amino acid sequence of PLZF with BTB domains from various other proteins and by analysis with prediction programs (NetPhos 2.0), several putative phosphorylated residues within the BTB domain of PLZF were identified along with residues previously shown to be crucial for PLZF to function as a transcriptional repressor (Figures S8-S10). Residues in PLZF were mutated to test their significance in the IFN\u03b1-mediated induction of the rsad2 promoter. This approach identified the tyrosine at position 88 and a serine residue at amino acid 76 to be important for induction of rsad2 ( Figure 6C ). Consistent with these promoter reporter assays, phosphorylation analysis of the full-length mutant protein (S76A) indicates that the residue at position 76 is the sole phospho-serine residue of significance in IFN-mediated activation ( Figure 6B ). Two additional mutations, R49D and L103E, that had previously been demonstrated to constitute important structural components on either surface of the BTB domain, had opposing effects upon ISG induction. As anticipated, the L103E mutation impaired activation of rsad2. Surprisingly, mutation of R49 induced the rsad2 reporter. While the structure of the charged pocket that surrounds the R49 residue had been demonstrated to be critical for PLZF to function as a transcriptional repressor, these results suggest that other residues of the BTB domain on the lateral surface, where L103 lies, may be more pertinent to the role of PLZF as a transcription inducer.\n\nTo identify the kinase that phosphorylates PLZF, reporter assays (using rsad-luciferase) were conducted in cells treated with kinase inhibitors, or cell lines defective in components of the IFN signaling pathway. Predictably, mutations in the JAK/STAT pathway led to the impairment of all IFN signaling for PLZF-regulated ISGs ( Figure S11 ). Treatment of Hela cells with pharmacological inhibitors of ERK (PD98059), JNK (SP600125), p38 (SB203580), Src (AZD0530), PI3K (AS-252424), or JAK2 (JAK2 inhibitor II), followed by stimulated with IFN, point to JNK as a possible PLZF kinase ( Figure 6D and E) , or at least a critical kinase in the pathway, and supports the significance of serine phosphorylation of the protein ( Figure  6B ).\n\nIFN-enhanced association of PLZF with select ISG promoters could also occur through regulation of transcriptional cofactors. Accordingly, we sought to measure IFN-induced changes in known PLZF cofactors. Transcriptional repression by PLZF is sensitive to inhibitors of deacetylation, and PLZF physically interacts with both class I and II histone deacetylases (HDACs) via the BTB domain (Ahmad et al., 1998; Chauchereau et al., 2004; David et al., 1998) . In accord with a requirement for HDAC activity for transcriptional activation of ISGs by PLZF, treatment of cells with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) blocked induction of selected ISGs in the PLZF-inducible U937T:PLZF45 cells or BMMs ( Figure 7A and B ). An association between the class I histone deacetylase HDAC1 and PLZF was shown by coimmunoprecipitation of over expressed FLAG-tagged PLZF in HEK293 cells. Notably, an association with the class II histone deacetylase HDAC4 was not detected under the same conditions ( Figure 7C ). This association between PLZF and HDAC1 was confirmed with endogenous protein under more physiologically relevant conditions in primary BMMs ( Figure  7D ). As an additional measure of co-operation between PLZF and HDAC1, the effect of coexpressing PLZF and HDAC1 upon the rsad2 reporter was measured in IFN-responsive RCC1 cells. Appropriately, co-expression of PLZF with HDAC1 enhanced the induction of the ISG promoter by IFN\u03b1 above that observed with either protein expressed alone. Moreover, treatment with TSA blocked the additive effect of PLZF and HDAC1 ( Figure 7E ).\n\nA second transcription factor reported to associate with PLZF is the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) (Koken et al., 1997; Regad and Chelbi-Alix, 2001) . Of relevance to this study, PML mediates the formation of nuclear bodies that are crucial in the IFN response. More directly, it has been established that the antiviral response is reduced in PML knockout MEFs (Day et al., 2004) . To determine whether PML is a cofactor in PLZF-mediated activation of ISGs, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed on lysates from the IFN-responsive HeLa cells, over-expressing PLZF-tagged constructs, or on endogenous PLZF from primary BMMs. PLZF was found to interact with PML in both cell types after IFN\u03b1 treatment (Figures 7F, 7G, S12, and S13). Importantly, PML has been demonstrated to alter the cellular location of PLZF (Koken et al., 1997) . To show whether the association between PLZF and PML, detected by immunoprecipitation, correlated with co-localization of the proteins within nuclear bodies, confocal microscopy with fluorescently tagged proteins was performed in RCC1 cells treated with or without IFN\u03b1. Indirect immunofluoresence confirms that PLZF localized with PML after IFN stimulation ( Figure 7H ). The reported induction of PML by IFN does not account for the observed co-localization, as the levels of PML did not significantly increase over the duration of this experiment ( Figure S14 ). Together these data show IFN treatment induces phosphorylation of PLZF, plausibly by JNK, and interaction with both HDAC1 and PML to mediate association of the complex with PLZF binding sites in gene promoters to induce specific ISGs.\n\nRecent studies have shown that type I IFN signaling is more complex than initially recognized, activating different specific signals and patterns of gene expression (van Boxel-Dezaire et al., 2006) . The response via the canonical JAK-STAT pathway alone is not sufficient to explain all the biological effects of type I IFNs. Accordingly, other kinases, including PI3K and MAP kinase, lead to the activation of additional transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB, AP-1, IRFs and PU.1, which interact with STATs at interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) via ISGF3 or other IRFs to regulate ISGs. Our results show that the transcription factor PLZF is a novel regulator of the IFN response. We show PLZF induces a specific subset of ISGs with PLZFbinding sites in proximity to ISRE. Gene array, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, and promoter reporter experiments demonstrate that PLZF directly occupies these select promoter sequences, and that this activity is IFN dependent. In this study, analysis of all genes induced by PLZF shows a predominance of ISGs, explicitly implicating PLZF in positively modulating the IFN pathway.\n\nAlthough PLZF has been designated as a transcriptional repressor, our observation that PLZF promotes ISG transcription is not without precedence (Labbaye et al., 2002; Senbonmatsu et al., 2003) . The mechanism for transcriptional repression by PLZF is thought to involve constraint of the accessibility of the gene to transcriptional machinery, via chromatin remodeling by acetlyation involving the nuclear corepressor complex (NCoR) and HDACs, particularly HDACs 1 and 4 (Chauchereau et al., 2004; David et al., 1998; Guidez et al., 2004; Hong et al., 1997; McLoughlin et al., 2002) . While HDACs are generally considered as corepressors, Qui et al. (Qiu et al., 2006) showed that HDAC1 served as a coactivator for the glucocorticoid receptor. More relevant to our findings, we and others found that inhibition of HDAC1 perturbed IFN-induced transcription and antiviral responses. Moreover, data generated from HDAC1 knockout cells show that this protein is required for the efficient activation of ISGs (Chang et al., 2004; Zupkovitz et al., 2006) . Also, HDAC1 but not HDAC4 associated with STAT1 and STAT2 to positively activate expression of the ISG3-dependent transcriptional response. Correspondingly, we detect an association between PLZF and HDAC1, not HDAC4, upon stimulation with IFN\u03b1, leading us to propose that HDAC1 is key to PLZF's role as a transcriptional enhancer. Similarly to HDAC1, a second PLZF cofactor, PML, is indispensable for the IFN response (Handwerger and Gall, 2006) . Appropriately, PML is induced by IFN through an ISRE and an IFN-gamma activation site (GAS) motif in its promoter, and the number and intensity of nuclear bodies increase in response to IFN (Stadler et al., 1995) . More directly, it has been established that the antiviral response is reduced in PML knockout MEFs (Day et al., 2004) . We demonstrate here that PLZF and PML associate, and that this interaction is also modulated by IFN.\n\nWhile the precise mechanism modulating the association between PLZF and its cofactors has not been established, it is predicted to be mediated by the BTB domain of PLZF (Melnick et al., 2000b) . This domain acts as a homodimerization motif that is essential for the repressor function of PLZF and its localization in nuclear bodies. (Melnick et al., 2000a) Our results suggest that this domain is also key for its transcriptional enhancer function. However, our observations indicate differences in how the BTB domain mediates repressor or enhancer activities of PLZF. Mutation of the residue at position 49 in the BTB domain of PLZF, shown to be essential for repressor activity, had the contradictory effect of further enhancing ISG expression. Mutation of another key structural residue, on the lateral face of the BTB domain at position 108, recapitulated the loss of function as a repressor. This implies that different regions of PLZF mediate repressor or enhancer functions. As we found an interaction between PLZF, PML and HDAC1 only following IFN stimulation, it seems likely that IFN signaling affects the state of one or all of these proteins. Informatively, the apparent paradoxical function of HDAC1 as a corepressor or coactivator appears to be regulated by acetylation of the protein itself (Melnick et al., 2000a) . It is also reported that PLZF is both acetylated and phosphorylated (Ball et al., 1999; Guidez et al., 2004) . In this study, PLZF was found to be phosphorylated at serine and tyrosine residues in response to IFN, and we identify a serine residue (Ser76) within the BTB domain of PLZF that is important for PLZF-mediated ISG induction, thereby implicating a serine kinase in PLZF activation. Accordingly, kinase inhibitor studies implicate the serine kinase JNK as a potential activator of PLZF.\n\nRecognition of PLZF-binding sites in proximity to ISRE suggests cooperation between canonical IFN transcription factors and PLZF. Only promoters containing both regulatory elements show both PLZF-and IFN-dependent expression. Experiments in STAT1 knockout cells demonstrate that this factor is required for PLZF-dependent transcriptional induction, as expected in IFN signaling. A direct comparison of PLZF-independent and -dependent genes demonstrates that tissue-specific expression patterns of the closely related ISGs IFIT1 and IFIT2 may be determined by PLZF ( Figure 3F ). We demonstrate that PLZF associates with other essential cofactors, PML and HDAC1. Consequently, we propose a model whereby PLZF functions to stabilize a transcription complex that minimally includes STATs, HDAC1, and PML to mediate the expression of specific ISGs.\n\nAlthough only a subset of ISGs is regulated by PLZF, the observed impairment is physiologically critical as it is sufficient to severely compromise the antiviral immune response. We present data that this immune impairment is due to direct defects in key IFNmediated antiviral factors, and to indirect mechanisms that modulate NK cell activity. The reduced viral load in the presence of PLZF and IFN suggests that IFN-improved survival after SFV infection requires PLZF. This correlates with regulation of the expression of the antiviral mediator OAS1. OAS1 combined with the ribonuclease L (RNaseL) constitutes an antiviral RNA decay pathway previously demonstrated to regulate SFV infection (Dong et al., 1996; Li et al., 1997) . Impaired induction of other ISGs such as IFIT2 and RSAD2, which have recently been shown to function as antiviral effectors, was also found (Borden et al., 2007) . Other ISGs identified as having impaired induction in plzf -/cells, most pertinently CXCL10, do not have a direct antiviral function. CXCL10 has been demonstrated, with other chemokines, to regulate NK cell function (Biron et al., 1999) . A recent study comparing wild type and CXCL10 -/mice has shown that CXCL10 expression promotes protection from coronavirusinduced neurological and liver disease (Walsh et al., 2007) . Furthermore, a study using CXCL9 -/and CXCL10 -/mice has found that these chemokines are critical for the control of Herpes Simplex Virus infection through mobilization of NK cells and CTL to sites of infection (Thapa et al., 2008) . IFN has an established role in the function of NK cells, and influences NK activation during viral infection. Defects in NK cell activity, such as decreased production of IFN, also render mice more susceptible to viral infection (Lee et al., 2007) . However, impaired NK cell function in plzf -/mice is independent of IFN production. Instead, we propose the observed defect in NK cell activity in the plzf -/mouse is due to impairment of specific ISGs, with CXCL10 identified as a likely candidate. PLZF-deficient mice show a marked decrease in CXCL10 expression in NK-cell-rich organs, which may lead to impaired mobility of NK cells, and therefore ineffective viral clearance. IFN-induced activation of NK cells resulted in potent cytotoxicity associated with a dramatic increase in GzmB. GzmB expression is essential to elicit NK cell cytotoxic function, and is responsible for the rapid induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Previous studies have demonstrated GzmB is an ISG Zimmerer et al., 2007) . However, the regulation of GzmB expression is not understood. Intriguingly, the GzmB promoter contains a binding site for PLZF, raising the possibility that PLZF directly regulates GzmB transcriptional. The findings here suggest that IFN-mediated activation of NK cells is regulated by PLZF.\n\nUntil recently PLZF had not been ascribed any role in immune regulation. However, two recent reports demonstrate that PLZF is also expressed in NK T cells and that the transcription factor is essential to the development of these cells (Kovalovsky et al., 2008; Savage et al., 2008) . Here we show that PLZF is also expressed in NK cells, and provide evidence that PLZF is pivotal in the IFN-dependent activation of NK cells. The finding described here provides evidence that PLZF plays an important role in innate immunity via modulation of the IFN response. PLZF regulates a key subset of ISGs with consequences for the archetypal function of IFN, to instigate resistance to virus infection.\n\nRCC1 (Campbell et al., 1998) and ACHN (ATCC CRL-1611) cells were maintained in RPMI and DMEM respectively. The U937T:PLZF45 inducible PLZF system was previously described (McConnell et al., 2003) and is based on the U937T autoregulatory tet-off system, in which withdrawal of tetracycline leads to gene expression. Actinomycin D was added to cells at a final concentration of 5 \u03bcg/ml for 8 h prior to IFN treatment. Trichostatin A was added to cells at a final concentration of 25 ng/ml for 8-24 h prior to IFN treatment. We obtained spleen macrophages and BMMs from age-matched plzf +/+ and plzf -/mice as previously described (Barna et al., 2000) . BMMs were isolated from mice and cultured as described (Sweet et al., 2001) . Cells were plated at a density of 1 \u00d7 10 7 cells/plate and were cultured for a further 24 h without colony-stimulating factor 1. Cells were treated with 500-1,000 IU/ml of IFN\u03b11, then were collected at 3, 6 and 9 h for gene expression analysis.\n\nPreviously obtained data of Affymetrix HG_U95Av2 expression profiles 24 and 48 h following PLZF expression, performed in biological triplicate, were analyzed for genes with significant changes in gene expression as a result of PLZF expression using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM; http://www-stat.stanford.edu/\u223ctibs/SAM/) (McConnell et al., 2003; Tusher et al., 2001) . RNA was extracted from control and IFN-treated U937T PLZF cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Labeling and hybridization to the custom ISG cDNA array were performed as described previously (Frevel et al., 2003; Sledz and Williams, 2004) . Analysis was performed using GeneSpring 5.0 (Agilent). Data was first normalized using LOWESS normalization for each experiment, and then each array was normalized to the intensity of GAPDH expression to compare intensities across samples. Genes with unreliable expression intensities below 300 for the induced sample (IFN-treated, PLZF-expressing, or PLZFexpressing IFN-treated) were discarded for further analyses. Data were filtered for genes induced over 2-fold in PLZF-expressing cells, and genes whose expression was 2-fold higher with PLZF and IFN treatment over IFN treatment alone were defined as PLZF responsive. PLZF-responsive genes were partitioned into seven sets using K-means cluster analysis with a standard correlation and 100 iterations.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was produced with random hexamer primers and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7700 Prism real-time PCR machine using the manufacturer's SYBR green kit and directions (Applied Biosystems). Expression analysis of human samples by real-time PCR was done with the primers listed in Supplemental Methods. The 2 -\u039b\u039bCt method was used for analysis using the untreated sample as the reference. Quantitative-PCR (Q-PCR) was performed in mouse samples. Predeveloped TaqMan probe/ primers for RASD2, IFIT2, 2\u2032-5\u2032OAS, CXCL10 and CCL5 (Applied Biosystems) were used to calculate the threshold cycle numbers that were transformed using the cycle threshold and relative value method as described by the manufacturer, and expressed relative to 18S ribosomal RNA. Results are expressed as relative gene expression for each target gene.\n\nTo elucidate functional similarities among the genes induced by PLZF, gene ontologies were mined using the Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) Functional Annotation Tool Suite. Promoters were retrieved using Promoser, and potential binding sites identified with MatInspector (Genomatix Suite). Over-represented motifs were identified by using MEME and JASPAR (Bailey and Elkan, 1995; Stormo, 2000) with the '-zoop' option, which indicates 'zero or one occurrence per sequence', and motif width set to be between 6 and 15 bp. The top 10 motifs were obtained. For each of these, the positional specific scoring matrix (PSSM) generated by MEME was searched against the TRANSFAC database using the MALIGN algorithm (Haverty et al., 2004) . The PLZF BTB domain was analyzed using the Conserved Domain Database and TCoffee. PLZF protein sequence was run by the NetPhos 2.0 server program for predictions of serine, threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites. The above bioinformatic analyses used the web programs listed in Supplemental Methods.\n\nChromatin immunoprecipitation assays were done according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biology). The presence of the target gene promoter sequences in both the input DNA and the recovered DNA immunocomplexes was detected by quantitative PCR. The antibodies used for ChIP were against PLZF (Calbiochem) and FLAG M2 (Sigma). Following reversal of the cross-linking, DNA was recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and then used in a PCR. The sequences of the primers used for the PCR are listed in Supplemental Methods. PCR for IFIT2, RSAD2, and ISG15 was performed using a Sybr Green PCR mastermix (AP Biotech) on an iCycler PCR machine (Biorad).\n\nFor immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed with triple detergent lysis buffer and incubated with antibodies (anti-PLZF, anti-FLAG) as indicated. Antibody complexes were isolated using protein A/G-agarose beads (Pharmacia Biotech) and immunocomplexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-phospho Ser or Tyr (Upstate), or antibodies against PLZF, PML, HDAC1 or HDAC4. Expression of PLZF was assessed by immunoblotting with anti-PLZF (Calbiochem). Protein bands were detected and quantified on a Li-Cor Odyssey infrared imaging system or exposure of the membrane to BioMax autoradiographic film (Kodak).\n\nKnockdown of PLZF was induced by transfection of BLOCK-iT\u2122 Pol II miR RNAi Expression Vector (RNAi PLZF plasmids targeting two different sequences in PLZF, and LacZ as control). The miRNA (plzf) target sequences were: miRNAi plzf13 (437-456), TGCTGTATAGTGTTGACTATTGCGGTTTTGGCCACTGACTGACCGCAATAGT CAACACTATA; and miRNAi plzf24 (1116-1135), TGCTGTAGTGTAGCTCCCTAGCACGTTTTGGCCACTGACTGACGTGCTAGGG AGCTACACTA. Starting 24 h after transfection, untransfected cells were eliminated by culturing the cells in the presence of 10 \u03bcg/ml blasticidin for 10-14 days. Total cellular RNA was isolated, and whole cell lysates used for Western blotting. The efficiency of the knockdown was assessed at the protein level by Western blotting.\n\nThe RASD2 luciferase reporter was provided by Dr Katherine Fitzgerald (Severa et al., 2006) and the IFIT2 luciferase reporter was cloned by PCR. All plasmids used in the transfection assay were prepared with the endotoxin-free plasmid Maxi-kit (Qiagen). 2 \u00d7 10 5 RCC1 or ACNH cells were incubated overnight. The wild type and mutant RSAD2 promoter reporter gene vector (1 \u03bcg) along with 0.2 \u03bcg of a phRL-TK Synthetic Renilla expression vector, were transfected into cells using Fugene 6 (Roche). After transfection for 24 h, the cells were harvested and lysed. Luciferase activity was generated with luciferase substrate and read out in opaque 96-well plates using a plate-reading luminometer. phRL-TK Synthetic Renilla was co-transfected to normalize transfection efficiency. Experiments were performed in triplicate.\n\nAbout 1-2 \u00d7 10 5 cells were seeded in Chamber slides (Lab-Tek II, Nalge Nunc International). The 60-80% confluent culture of cells was treated with IFN\u03b1 for 2-4 h. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and blocked with CAS blocking solution (Zymed). The cells were incubated with the PML (Santa Cruz) primary antibody then incubated sequentially with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes), and analyzed by fluorescence or confocal microscopy (Leica Instruments).\n\nWild type and plzf -/primary MEFs were generated. Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 1 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well and incubated overnight, then treated with serial dilutions of mouse IFN-\u03b14 for 16 h, and challenged with SFV virus (10 5 -10 7 pfu) for a further 48 and 72 h. Viral titers were determined as the dilution at which 50% death occurred and are expressed as log 10 titers or as 'fold dilution' (Fenner et al., 2006) . Cells were fixed with cold methanol and stained with crystal violet, before reading optical density at 620 nm.\n\nPups between 5 and 6 days of age were injected intraperitoneally with 50 \u03bcl SFV at 10\u00d7, 30\u00d7 and 100 TCID 50 , determined by CPE bioassay of mouse L929 cell cultures. Some mice were preinjected with mouse IFN\u03b1 6 h before viral infection. The mouse IFN\u03b1 titer was verified in a CPE-reduction bioassay. Experiments with wild type and plzf -/mice used littermate controls and were conducted by researchers 'blinded' to experimental conditions, with genotypes being determined after completion of the experiments. Mice were monitored at 3-6 h intervals and resistance was recorded up to 3 weeks. Viral titers of each organ were measured at day 3 of SFV infection and IFN pretreatment (Fenner et al., 2006) . For in vivo infections with EMCV, 500 plaque-forming units were injected i.p. into plzf -/mice and wild type littermate controls. These studies were approved by the Monash University Monash Medical Centre A Animal Ethics Committee (Melbourne, Australia).\n\nSerum samples from neonatal mice were diluted in semi-log 10 steps in duplicate into 96-well plates containing L929 cell monolayers. The medium was removed 16 h later and SFV added at a concentration of 10\u00d7 TCID 50 in fresh RPMI medium. Plates were subsequently incubated for 48-72 h, after which they were assigned scores for CPE. This assay measures the activity of all type I and type II interferons. The interferon activity (IU/ml) was calculated by comparison of the titer of the sample with a laboratory IFN\u03b1 standard calibrated to the National Institutes of Health reference standard Ga02-901-511.\n\nThis flow cytometric method, previously described by Lecoeur et al. (Lecoeur et al., 2001) , entails labeling effector cells with carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE), to allow them to be discriminated from target cells, followed by the addition of 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD), to label killed targets. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 0.1 ml of PBS containing poly(I:C) (10 \u03bcg/mouse), or IFN\u03b1 (1\u00d710 5 IU/mouse) and splenocytes were harvested after 24 or 60 h, respectively, and labeled with CFSE. In vitro NK lysis was monitored by incubating different numbers of CFSE-labeled effector cells with 1\u00d710 4 target cells (YAC-1 cells) at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. In parallel, target cells were incubated alone to measure basal apoptosis. Immediately before analysis, 1 \u03bcg/ml (final concentration) of 7-AAD was added to each sample and incubated for 20 min. The percentage of apoptotic (7-AAD lo +7-AAD hi ) cells is used to calculate the percentage of specific lysis according to the following formula: % specific lysis = 100\u00d7(% sample lysis \u2212 % basal lysis)/(100 \u2212 % basal lysis). Sample lysis is the cell lysis in the presence of effectors at a given E:T ratio, and basal lysis is the cell lysis in the absence of effectors.\n\nSpleens were harvested and single-cell suspensions were generated. Red blood cells were lysed and the cells washed in RPMI medium. For in vitro cytokine stimulation, splenocytes were plated at 10 \u00d7 10 6 /ml in 24-well plates in 1000 U/ml IL-2. Cells were harvested by pipetting with cold PBS after 48 h and analyzed by flow cytometry. For cell sorting, splenocytes were surface stained with anti-NK1.1, anti-CD3 and anti-B220 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen), and CD3 + NK1.1 -, CD3 -NK1.1 + or B220 cells were isolated by cell sorter (routinely \u226599% pure).\n\nSplenocytes or tissue mononuclear cells were stained for surface markers (NK1.1) and intracellular Gzmb as described (eBioscience Foxp3 staining protocol) with directly conjugated Gzmb (1:400 dilution) monoclonal antibodies. Sample data were acquired on a Cytek-modified FACScan (BD) flow cytometer and Isotype controls were used to set quadrant gates.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material. (A,B) To determine factors contributing to IFN sensitivity, two RCC cell lines, ACHN and RCC1, were analyzed for ISG expression and response to IFN treatment. (A) ISGs induced over 1.5-fold by 1,000 IU/ml IFN\u03b1 at any one time point in either ACHN or RCC1 cells. (B) Western blot analysis of PLZF expression in ACHN and RCC1 cells. (C,D) PLZF regulates a subset of ISGs. (C) PLZF-inducible U937T cells were treated with IFN\u03b1 for 6, 16 and 24 h in the presence and absence of PLZF expression (24 h tetracycline withdrawal) and RNA samples analyzed for ISG expression. The bar graph below shows the number of genes induced at least 2-fold for each sample. PLZF alone results in ISG induction and also enhances ISG induction following IFN treatment. (D) Expression of select genes (Table S4 ) was verified using SYBR Green real time RT-PCR. (A) Serum IFN concentrations from neonatal wild type (WT) and plzf -/mice injected with IFN\u03b1, with and without SFV injection. IFN was measured after 48 h by CPE reduction assay. (B) IFN-induced ISG expression of the antiviral IFN effectors OAS1, RSAD2 and IFIT2, and the chemokines CXCL10 (IP-10) and CCL5 (RANTES) were measured in WT or plzf -/-BMMs after IFN\u03b1 treatment for 6 h. (C-E) The levels of mRNA of the chemokine CXCL10 (IP-10) and the antiviral ISGs OAS1, RSAD2 and IFIT2 were measured in predominantly NK cell rich organs from WT and plzf -/neonatal mice after IFN\u03b1 treatment and SFV infection. RNA samples were analyzed for ISG expression using a custom ISG probe (AppliedBiosystems). Data are representative of three independent experiments (mean \u00b1 SEM; A-E). (F) PLZF expression correlates with IFIT2 induction in response to IFN in WT and plzf -/mice. PLZF was expressed in macrophage and NK cell rich organs such as spleen, lung and liver (bottom panel). The expression profiles of two closely related genes (IFIT1 and IFIT2) were then compared following intravenous injection of IFN\u03b1. Mice were injected with PBS or IFN\u03b1 (1\u00d7105 IU), and after 8 h multiple organs were removed and RNA was extracted. IFIT1 and IFIT2 levels were analyzed by real time RT-PCR, using a custom ISG probe (AppliedBiosystems) (top panels). Data are representative of three independent experiments (mean \u00b1 SEM). (A) Expression of the gene encoding PLZF in mouse spleen lymphocytes. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the expression of PLZF transcripts, relative to the expression of 18S mRNA, in various sorted lymphocyte populations. Results are the means of three independent experiments (mean \u00b1 SD). (B) NK cell numbers in the spleens of plzf -/and wild type (WT) mice. Data (mean \u00b1 SD) are representative of three experiments. (C) Diminished NK cell activity in plzf -/mice. Splenocytes labeled with carboxy-fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) were incubated for 4 h with NK-sensitive YAC-target cells at the indicated effector-to-target (E:T) ratios. Lysed cells were detected by 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) incorporation. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 10 \u03bcg of poly (I:C) 24 h (top panel), or IFN\u03b1 2 days (bottom panel) before splenocyte isolation. Data are representative of four independent experiments (mean \u00b1 SD). (D) WT and plzf -/mice were injected i.p. with 50 \u03bcg poly(I:C) or PBS (control), and after 24 h, splenic NK1.1 + CD3 -NK cell expression of intracellular Gzmb was analyzed by flow cytometry. Flow-cytometry data representative of at least five independent experiments are shown in the WT, with a significant increase in the percentage of NK cells positive (mean \u00b1 SD) for Gzmb after poly(I:C) injection. (A-C) Over-expression of PLZF in RCC1 and ACHN cells induces RSAD2 and IFIT2 promoter activity. Cells were co-transfected with a PLZF expression plasmid and RSAD2-Luc or IFIT2-Luc promoter reporter constructs, then treated with IFN\u03b1 (500 IU/ml of IFN\u03b11). The luciferase values were obtained in at least three independent experiments. (D) Western blot analysis of PLZF in RCC1 cells expressing targeted or control miRNA (top panel). Luciferase assay for RSAD2 promoter induction in RCC1 cells expressing miRNAs targeting PLZF (PLZF1.3 and PLZF2.4) or the control miRNA targeting LacZ (LacZ) then stimulated with IFN\u03b1 (bottom panel). Data are representative of three independent experiments (mean \u00b1 SD; A-D) . (E) Chromatin from PLZF-inducible U937T cells grown in the presence or absence of tetracycline (24 h) and IFN\u03b1 (1,000 U/ml for 6 or 24 h) was immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. Promoters of RSAD2, IFIT2 and IFI15 were amplified from the immunoprecipitated chromatin using SYBR Green quantitative RT-PCR. Data was normalized to the 10% input and FLAG antibody samples, expressed as 2 -(PLZFCt-10% inputCt)-(FLAGCt-10% inputCt) . (B) Serine76 is required for PLZF phosphorylation in response to IFN. Hela cells were transiently transfected with wild-type (WT) FLAG-PLZF or various mutant PLZF expression plasmids, followed by IFN\u03b1 treatment, immunoprecipitated (IP) with the anti-FLAG antibody and immunoblotted (IB) with a phosphoserine or FLAG antibody, as indicated. (C) Luciferase assay for RSAD2 promoter induction in lysates of RCC1 cells transfected with wild type (WT) or indicated mutant PLZF expression plasmids, followed by stimulation with IFN\u03b1. The values obtained from at least three independent transfection experiments were normalized. (D,E) JNK inhibitor is sufficient to block PLZF-regulated RSAD2 promoter induction following IFN\u03b1 stimulation. (D) Hela cells were transfected with PLZF expression and RSAD2 promoter reporter plasmids. The cells were then either left untreated or were treated with inhibitors of ERK (5 \u03bcM PD98059), JNK (1 \u03bcM SP600125), p38 (2.5 \u03bcM SB203580), Src (1 \u03bcM AZD0530), PI3K (1 \u03bcM AS-252424) or JAK2 (0.5 \u03bcM JAK2 inhibitor II), followed by IFN\u03b1 stimulation for 8 h before measuring RSAD2 promoter reporter activity in cell lysates. (E) The inhibition of PLZF-dependent RSAD2 promoter activity by JNK inhibitor occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Data are representative of three independent experiments (mean \u00b1 SD; C-E)."}
