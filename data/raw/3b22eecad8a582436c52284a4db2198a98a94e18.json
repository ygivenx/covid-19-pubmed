{"title": "Robitaille et al. 1 DUSP1 regulates apoptosis and cell migration, but not the JIP1-protected cytokine response, during Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Sendai Virus infection", "body": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) belongs to the Pneumoviridae family of large enveloped negative-sense ssRNA viruses that includes important human pathogens 1, 2 . RSV is a leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections associated with morbidity and mortality in infants, children and elderly, but also adults of all-age with a compromised immune system, cardiopulmonary diseases or following transplantation 3, 4 . The capacity of the host to mount an appropriate antiviral defense aimed at limiting virus replication and spreading is critical to determine the outcome of the infection. As a consequence, the inability of the host to sustain an antiviral response leads to failure in eradicating the infection. Conversely, uncontrolled duration or intensity of the response is harmful to the host and is associated with the development of virus-associated pathogenesis, chronic inflammatory diseases and various autoimmune diseases 5, 6 . Therefore, these responses need to reach the ideal intensity and duration for efficient fighting of the infection while limiting tissue damage and promote tissue repair 7 . To this aim, the various components of the host antiviral defense, including the transcriptional induction of interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, but also the activation of cell death pathways, such as apoptosis, are subjected to stringent regulation by both positive and negative mechanisms 8,9 . Upon virus entry and sensing by the cytosolic pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5), the mitochondrial membrane-associated adaptor (MAVS) coordinates multiple signalling pathways ultimately leading to the activation of the transcription factors IFN regulatory factors (IRF) 3/7, Nuclear Factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and Activator Protein 1 (AP-1) [10] [11] [12] . Activation of IRF3\n\n. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

The Ser/Thr protein phosphatase, Mg 2+ /Mn 2+ -dependent (PPM) 1B acts as a TBK1 phosphatase to inhibit IRF3 activation, while PPM1A targets both TBK1/IKK\u03b5 and MAVS for dephosphorylation to negatively regulate the antiviral response 33,34 .\n\nIn the present study, we sought to address the role of the MKP-1/DUSP1 dual phosphatase (referred to thereafter as DUSP1) in the regulation of the host-defense against RSV and Sendai virus (SeV), a model paramyxovirus that is currently evaluated as a replicationcompetent backbone for the development of an RSV vaccine 3 . We demonstrate that DUSP1 is a negative regulator of RSV-and SeV-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation. However, this function is neither linked to the inhibition of the antiviral response nor to the induction of a cytokine and chemokine response elicited during virus infection. Interestingly, we found that interaction of JNK by the JNK interacting protein (JIP) 1 scaffold protein, previously shown to be critical for AP-1 and downstream cytokine production specifically, protects JNK from dephosphorylation by DUSP1. Although we confirmed that a JNK/p38 signalling module is involved in the induction of virus-induced apoptosis, our data suggests that DUSP1 has a proapoptotic function independently of JNK and p38 during SeV infection. Finally, we found that DUSP1 dampens cell migration during RSV infection. Altogether, these findings point to a previously unrecognized role of DUSP1 in functions that have an impact on virus-associated tissue damage and repair.\n\n.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/163360 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nTo first assess a potential function of DUSP1, we analyzed DUSP1 expression during the course of SeV and RSV infection in A549 cells by immunoblot. DUSP1 was induced by about 4 fold at 6 h of RSV infection and was returned to basal levels at 24 h post-infection ( Figure 1A) . DUSP1 steady state levels remained unchanged during SeV infection ( Figure 1A) . Because DUSP1 turnover was previously reported to be affected by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway 35 , we further analyzed DUSP1 levels during SeV and RSV infection in the presence of the 26S proteasome inhibitor MG132. In the presence of MG132, induction of DUSP1 is detectable in both infections and the overall DUSP1 levels were markedly increased compared to control cells ( Figure 1B) . These results imply that DUSP1 protein levels are induced in response to SeV and RSV infection and that DUSP1 is subjected to proteasome-mediated degradation.\n\nNext, we sought to determine whether DUSP1 belongs to the numerous negative regulators of the antiviral response induced in response to virus infections 9, 36 . First, because of their importance in the control of the IFN-mediated antiviral defense, we evaluated whether DUSP1 has an impact on the signaling cascades leading to NF-\u03baB and IRF3 activation. Considering previous characterization of NF-\u03baB activation in the context of RSV infection 37 , I\u03baB\u03b1-S32 and p65-S536 phosphorylation were analyzed. Activation of IRF3 was monitored through detection of IRF3-S396 phosphorylation 38 . Ectopic expression of DUSP1 in A549 cells did not alter I\u03baB\u03b1, p65 or IRF3 phosphorylation profiles observed during the course of SeV (Figure 2A and B) or .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/163360 doi: bioRxiv preprint RSV infection (Figure 2C) , showing that DUSP1 does not play a role in the regulation of these defense pathways. Additionally, ectopic expression of DUSP1 in A549 cells neither significantly altered SeV N mRNA levels measured by qRT-PCR (Figure 2D top panel) nor the de novo production of RSV virions quantified by plaque assay (Figure 2D bottom panel) . Consistently, RNAi-mediated silencing of DUSP1 did not alter the capacity of RSV to replicate in A549 cells ( Figure 2E ). Together these data indicate that DUSP1 does not negatively regulate the capacity of the cell to mount an antiviral response to restrict RSV or SeV replication.\n\nBecause DUSP1 preferentially dephosphorylates JNK and p38 in a variety of inflammatory contexts 39,40 , we next sought to evaluate the role of DUSP1 in the negative regulation of RSVand SeV-induced JNK and p38 activation. First, we monitored the effect of ectopically expressed DUSP1 on the SeV-and RSV-induced JNK T183/Y185 and p38 T180/Y182 phosphorylation in A549 cells. As expected, immunoblot analysis revealed that SeV ( Figure 3A and B) , and to a lesser extent RSV (Figure 3C) , induce JNK and p38 phosphorylation. Importantly, DUSP1 expression abrogates JNK and p38 phosphorylation (Figure 3A-C) . Subsequently, we confirmed the role of DUSP1 through analysis of the impact of DUSP1 silencing on the profile of virusinduced JNK and p38 phosphorylation. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the efficiency of DUSP1 silencing in A549 cells throughout the course of SeV and RSV infection (Figure 4) . Consistent with a role of DUSP1 in the dephosphorylation of JNK and p38, we observed a marked increase of JNK and p38 phosphorylation in the absence of DUSP1 during SeV ( Figure 4A ) and RSV infection ( Figure 4B) . Altogether, these observations reveal a critical role of DUSP1 in the negative regulation of JNK and p38 activation during RSV and SeV infection.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of JIP proteins in RSV-and SeVinduced JNK activation and regulation by DUSP1. The JIP family is composed of 4 members, JIP1-4, with distinct expression profiles. Here, we assessed the role of JIP1 and JIP3 in A549 cells based on previous reports indicative of their expression in lung cells [43] [44] [45] [46] . In contrary, JIP2 was shown to be restricted to human brain 47 and human JIP4 was found only in testis 48, 49 . First, we tested the interaction between JNK and JIP1 or JIP3 during SeV and RSV infection.\n\nEctopically expressed JIP1 coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous JNK, both in uninfected and SeV-and RSV-infected cells ( Figure 5A ). By contrast, JIP3 did not interact with JNK ( Figure   5A ). Since we demonstrated the existence of a JIP1/JNK complex, we examined the role of JIP1 in the regulation of DUSP1 dephosphorylation during SeV and RSV infection. A549 cells were cotransfected with JIP1 together with empty or DUSP1-expressing constructs before infection with SeV ( Figure 5B ) or RSV ( Figure 5C ). Confirming our finding (Figure 3) , ectopic expression of DUSP1 resulted in inhibition of SeV-and RSV-induced JNK phosphorylation (Figure 5B and C). Importantly, when JIP1 was coexpressed with DUSP1, the levels of phosphorylated JNK was increased 5.9 and 4 times compared to cells transfected with DUSP1 only during SeV and RSV infection, respectively ( Figure 5D ). Collectively, these data demonstrate that JIP1 interacts with JNK and that recruitment of JNK by JIP1 prevents dephosphorylation by DUSP1 during SeV and RSV infection.

Measurement of SeV-induced IFNB, CXCL8\n\nand CCL2 mRNA levels revealed no impact of DUSP1 ectopic expression, excluding a role of DUSP1 in the transcriptional regulation of cytokines (Supplemental Figure 2) . Similar results were observed during RSV infection, with silencing of DUSP1 having no impact on the induction of IFN\u03b2, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8 and IL-6 ( Figure 6G ). Altogether these observations point to a selective role of DUSP1 in the negative regulation of JNK and p38 during SeV and RSV infection, leaving the AP-1 pathway and downstream cytokine production intact.\n\nJNK/p38 MAPK pathways are also known to play a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis, being either pro-or anti-apoptotic depending on the context [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . A MAVS/JNK pathway has been shown to be indispensable for SeV to induce apoptosis 60, 61 . Therefore, we sought to assess the impact of DUSP1 on the JNK/p38-dependent apoptosis triggered by SeV. A549 cells were transfected with siCtrl or siDUSP1 followed by treatment with DMSO (vehicle) or SP600125 and SB203580 to inhibit JNK and p38 before SeV infection. Quantification of Annexin V+ cells, corresponding to early and late apoptosis, was performed by Flow cytometry analysis of Annexin V/PI stained cells ( Figure 7A ). Confirming a moderate role of JNK/p38 in SeVinduced apoptosis, inhibition of JNK/p38 reduced the number of Annexin V+ cells by 12 %.\n\nUnexpectedly, DUSP1 silencing also similarly decreased SeV-induced apoptosis by 10 %.\n\nImportantly, when DUSP1 silencing and JNK/p38 inhibition were combined, SeV-induced apoptosis was decreased by 23 %, showing an additive effect of the two pathways. SeV-induced apoptosis involves the intrinsic pathway leading to caspase 9 and 3 activation 62 . Therefore, to confirm the impact of JNK/p38 inhibition and/or DUSP1 silencing on SeV-induced apoptosis, .

Confirming the results of Annexin V, both inhibition of JNK and p38 and silencing of DUSP1 significantly impaired SeV-induced caspase 3 cleavage ( Figure 7B) . Additionally, caspase 9 cleavage that was induced following SeV infection confirming the engagement of the intrinsic pathway, was reduced in the absence of DUSP1 compared to control cells ( Figure 7B ). These findings confirmed that a JNK/p38 signaling module is involved in the induction of apoptosis during SeV infection, but they also argue against a negative regulation of this pathway by DUSP1. Rather, the observations support the hypothesis that DUSP1 is required for induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway independently of JNK and p38.\n\nIn The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/163360 doi: bioRxiv preprint from their origin compared to control cells that rather adopted a trajectory in circles around their point of origin (Figure 8) . These observations demonstrate a critical negative role of DUSP1 in the regulation of cell migration during RSV infection.\n\nDUSP1 is expressed in various cell types and tissues and mainly acts as a critical negative regulator shaping the duration, magnitude and spatiotemporal profile of p38 and JNK MAPKs, and to a lesser extent ERK, activation following physiological and pathological stimuli 65 .\n\nAs such, DUSP1 has been extensively shown to negatively regulate the innate immune antibacterial defense and the cellular response to allergens 66, 67 . In these contexts, DUSP1 mainly inhibits proinflammatory cytokine expression 40, [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] . The role of DUSP1 in the innate response to virus infection is far less known and, to our knowledge, was not previously assessed in the context of infection by RSV or SeV.\n\nIn the present study, we show that DUSP1 negatively regulates p38 and JNK phosphorylation induced by SeV and RSV (Figure 3 and 4 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/163360 doi: bioRxiv preprint a wide panel of cytokines elicited during infection (Figure 6 ). We hypothesized that this observation might reflect the existence of different subsets of JNK segregated through the interaction with specific scaffold proteins. In the MAPK signaling modules involving JNK, members of the JIP family of scaffold proteins selectively enhance specific JNK-dependent functions by interacting with and linking the upstream kinases to JNK activation 41,42 . In our experimental model, we showed that JNK interacts with JIP1, but not with JIP3, at basal levels and during infection ( Figure 5A) . Importantly, we found that the JIP1/JNK interaction dampens the capacity of DUSP1 to dephosphorylate JNK (Figure 5B-D) . Compelling evidence demonstrates that JIP1 is essential for the activation of the JNK/AP-1 axis that controls cytokine expression [50] [51] [52] [53] . Although we cannot exclude other mechanisms, it is reasonable to speculate that during SeV and RSV infection, the sequestration of JNK through molecular interaction with JIP1 protects JNK and downstream AP-1 and cytokine response from DUSP1 negative regulation (Figure 6) . Further studies will be required to fully address this model. Previous reports have shown that interaction with JIP1 leads to the retention of JNK in the cytoplasm 43 Moreover, the JIP1/JNK axis has also been shown to be pro-apoptotic in neurons exposed to The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/163360 doi: bioRxiv preprint characterize DUSP1-dependent JNK and p38 functions, we thus assessed the impact of DUSP1 on cell migration during RSV infection. Indeed, accumulating evidence implicates JNK and p38 in pro-migratory functions in various contexts 64 . Here, we demonstrate that in the absence of DUSP1, cell migration of RSV infected cells was highly enhanced (Figure 8) Altogether our results suggest a model in which DUSP1 is a negative regulator of important host mechanisms that limit tissue damage and promote tissue repair. An exaggerated cytokine response can also contribute to host self-inflicted damages and thereby contribute to virus-induced pathogenesis 86 . We found that the cytokine response remains intact upon manipulation of DUSP1 expression due to protection by the interaction of JNK with JIP1 ( Figure   5A ). The observation that JIP1/JNK interaction prevents a potential negative regulation of the cytokine response by DUSP1 opens avenues for specific therapeutic targeting. Indeed, one can hypothesize that inhibition of the JIP1/JNK interaction might restore DUSP1-dependent inhibition The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.
