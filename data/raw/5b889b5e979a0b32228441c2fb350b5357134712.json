{"title": "5 0 -O-Masked 2 0 -deoxyadenosine analogues as lead compounds for hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapeutic agents", "body": "The hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of the family Flaviviridae, is an enveloped, positive-sense, singlestrand RNA virus. 1 The virus is a major causative agent of non-A, non-B hepatitis and infects an estimated 170 million people worldwide. 2 In most cases, acute phase infection with HCV is asymptomatic; however, the virus frequently establishes chronic hepatitis in up to 80% of the infected individuals and persists for decades with a substantially high risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. 3 Currently, there is no vaccine available against HCV, and the approved drugs are combinations of interferon-a (IFN-a) and ribavirin (1-b-D D-ribofuranosyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide). Although the use of pegylated IFN-a instead of the unmodified one has resulted in improved therapeutic effectiveness, the sustained virological response is still poor (41-55%); moreover, in some cases, significant side effects can be caused. 4 Therefore, more efficacious therapies are urgently required for ensuring public health. 5 To date, a number of nucleoside analogues, including ribavirin, have been synthesized and tested for anti-HCV activity. 6, 7 Among these, some 2 0 -modified ribonucleoside analogues such as 2 0 -C-methyl analogues 1, 6a 2 0 -fluoro analogues 2, 6b and 2 0 -O-methyl analogue 3 6c exhibit potent anti-HCV activities in a cell-based HCV replicon assay (Fig. 1) . Particularly, Valopicitabine, a prodrug of 1c, is currently in phase II clinical trials. 8 Recently, the anti-HCV properties of 4 0 -substituted ribonucleosides such as 4 have also been reported by the Roche group. 6d Concerning the antiviral mechanism of common nucleoside analogues, it is known that most of these analogues are converted to their corresponding 5 0triphosphates by cellular and/or viral enzymes and then compete with natural triphosphates as substrates for incorporation into viral nucleic acids during viral replication. 9 Therefore, the 5 0 -hydroxyl group is indispensable to the anti-HCV activity of these nucleoside analogues. 10 Recently, we have reported that a carbocyclic oxetanocin analogue 5, one of whose hydroxyl groups (that corresponds to the 5 0 -hydroxyl group of the ribonucleoside) was masked by a benzoyl group, showed antiviral activity against the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Fig. 2 ). 11 Interestingly, the antiviral activity of 5 (EC 50 = 14.5 lM) was much more efficacious than that of the unmasked 6 (almost no activity, EC 50 > 300 lM), which seems to indicate an inconsistency with the necessity of the 5 0 -hydroxyl group to this compound.\n\nThis result attracted our interest and led us to expect that this unique trend could contribute to developing anti-HCV agents as well. Thus, several nucleoside analogues, including 5 and 6, were designed as candidate compounds for the agents (Fig. 3) . In this paper, we report the syntheses of these nucleoside analogues and their biological evaluations as anti-HCV agents.\n\nCompounds 7-9, 11, 13, 14, 22 , and 23 were prepared based on the previous reports. 12 The syntheses of com-pounds 10, 12, and 15-19 were carried out by the treatment of diol 9 or 11 with the corresponding acyl or sulfonyl chloride (i.e., benzoyl chloride for 10 and 12; pivaloyl chloride, butyryl chloride, p-methoxybenzoyl chloride, 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl chloride, and benzenesulfonyl chloride for 15-19, respectively), as shown in Scheme 1. In the case of compound 18, conventional conditions (trimethylbenzoyl chloride, DMAP, and pyridine) required a long reaction time and led to the gradual decomposition of 9 and 18, probably because the 6-chloropurine moiety reacted with the amine bases by degrees due to its electrophilic nature. This side reaction was slightly suppressed by the use of a lownucleophilic base, N,N-diisopropylethylamine instead of pyridine and DMAP.\n\nCompound 10 was also prepared via an alternative route illustrated in Scheme 2A. Regioselective protection of the 5 0 -hydroxyl group of 2 0 -deoxyadenosine (26) yielded the benzoate 23 in 65% yield, 12c which was subsequently converted to the silyl ether 27 in 93% yield. After transformation to the 6-chloropurine derivative 28 with a 58% yield, 13 the TBS group was cleaved to afford 10 in 72% yield. Compound 28 was also used as an intermediate in the synthesis of 25, as shown in Scheme 2B. Exposure of 28 to sodium methylthiolate resulted in the formation of the debenzoylated 6-SMe analogue 29 with a 67% yield, which was reacylated into 30 in 97% yield. Unfortunately, the use of thiourea in place of sodium methylthiolate led to the decomposition of the resultant products. Finally, the removal of the TBS group afforded 25 in 88% yield. The synthesis of 24 is illustrated in Scheme 2C. The diacetate 31, which was prepared as described in a previous report, 11 was treated with dimethylamine to furnish 32 in 62% yield. 14 Subsequently, regioselective benzoylation of the 5 0 -hydroxyl group in 32 afforded 24 in 77% yield.\n\nMeanwhile, the syntheses of 20 and 21 turned out to be unexpectedly difficult because of the instability of these molecules under both strongly basic and acidic conditions; for example, the exposure of 9 to BnBr-NaH or BnOC(@NH)CCl 3 -CF 3 SO 3 H afforded a complex mixture. Thus, a stepwise protection-deprotection process was required, which is illustrated in Scheme 3 (3A: synthesis of 20, 3B: synthesis of 21). The monoacetate 33, which was prepared from 26 by employing a partly modified Santaniello's procedure, 15 was converted to the silyl ether 34 in 94% yield. The use of a mixed solvent (pyridine-DMF) effectively reduced the competitive silylation of the 6-amino group. Protection of the amino group with pivaloyl chloride followed by the removal of the acetyl group in 35 afforded 36 with a 98% yield in two steps. The addition of DMAP and MeOH in the N-pivaloylation step was effective in converting the N,N-dipivaloylated by-product to the desired 35. Chemoselective benzylation of the 5 0 -hydroxyl group in 36 was successfully carried out by using 2.5 equiv of potassium tert-butoxide and 1.1 equiv of benzyl bromide in THF to provide 37 in 97% yield. After the removal of the pivaloyl group (76% yield), the resultant amino group of 38 was substituted with a chloro group to provide 39, which was subsequently deprotected to afford 20 with a 34% yield in two steps. Compound 21 was synthesized employing almost the same method as that for 20 described above (Scheme 3B, 20% overall yield from 36).\n\nThe above synthesized nucleoside analogues were assayed for their ability to inhibit HCV RNA replication in a subgenomic replicon Huh7 cell line (LucNeo#2), 16 and the result is shown in Table 1 . These cells contain a HCV subgenomic replicon RNA encoding a luciferase reporter gene as a marker. The potency of the analogues against the HCV replicon is expressed as EC 50 , which was quantified by a luciferase assay after a two-day incubation period with the corresponding compound. In addition, the associated cytotoxicity, which is expressed as CC 50 in Table 1 , was evaluated in a tetrazolium (XTT)-based assay according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\nAs expected, the benzoylated carbocyclic oxetanocin analogue 5 exhibited a stronger anti-HCV activity than that shown by the unprotected 6 (EC 50 = 6.4 lM and 46.1 lM, respectively). This trend seems to be consistent with that of the anti-SARS-coronavirus activity, as mentioned above ( Fig. 2 ; EC 50 = 14.5 lM and >300 lM, respectively). However, compound 5 displayed a cytotoxic effect at a level close to its EC 50 value (CC 50 = 20.0 lM; antiviral index = 3.1); therefore, further evaluation of this compound was not undertaken.\n\n2.2.1. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the sugar moiety. To evaluate the effect of the sugar moiety, several 6-chloropurine derivatives that possessed the ribofuranosyl structure (7 and 8), or deoxyribofuranosyl structure (2 0 -deoxy: 9 and 10; 3 0 -deoxy: 11 and 12), or an acyclic backbone (13 and 14) were tested. Among them, the 2 0 -deoxyribonucleoside derivative 10 exhibited the highest potency against the HCV replicon with an EC 50 of 6.1 lM, which is ninefold potent over that of ribavirin, and a CC 50 of 111 lM. Additionally, the 5 0 -O-benzoyl analogue 10 was more potent than the corresponding unprotected analogue 9 (EC 50 : 6.1 lM (5 0 -OBz, 10) vs 47.2 lM (5 0 -OH, 9)). This trend was also observed in the acyclic analogues 13 and 14 (EC 50 : 13.3 lM (\u00c0OBz, 14) vs 80.8 lM (\u00c0OH, 13)). In contrast, in case of the ribofuranosyl structure, the 5 0 -hydroxyl analogue 7 was slightly more potent as compared with the 5 0 -O-benzoyl analogue 8 (EC 50 = 31.0 and 41.0 lM, respectively). These results indicate the importance of the masked 5 0 -hydroxyl group in the 2 0 -deoxyribofuranosyl structure. It is also interesting to note that the 2 0 -deoxyribonucleoside derivative 10 was more potent than the corresponding ribonucleoside derivatives such as 7 and 8 in spite of the fact that HCV is an RNA virus and most of the anti-HCV agents bear ribofuranosyl structures (or their bioisosteres). 6,7\n\n2.2.2. SAR of the 5 0 -O-moiety. As a next step, we evaluated the inhibitory activities of compounds 15-21, whose 5 0 -hydroxyl groups were masked with various protective groups (i.e., pivaloyl, butyryl, trimethylbenzoyl, benzenesulfonyl, benzyl, and allyl groups) to examine the effect of the substituent group at the 5 0 -position. Among these compounds, the EC 50 value of the close structural analogue 17 (p-methoxybenzoyl analogue) was comparable to that of 10 (EC 50 = 8.4 and 6.1 lM, respectively); however, 17 led to an undesir-able increase in cytotoxicity (CC 50 = 76.4 lM). Notably, other types of protective groups such as ether groups (compounds 20 and 21) and a sulfonate group (compound 19) also exhibited good anti-HCV activity (EC 50 = 17.7, 24.5, and 28.8 lM, respectively). Overall, it appears that protective groups containing a phenyl ring are preferable for the antiviral activity.\n\n3. SAR at position 6 of the purine base. The effect of the substituents at the purine 6-position was investigated by the evaluation of compounds 22-25. Among these analogues, the 6-dimethylamino derivative 24 exhibited a good potency with an EC 50 of 22.3 lM and low cytotoxicity (CC 50 > 200 lM), while the 6-amino derivative 23 showed a weak potency (EC 50 = 105 lM). Unfortunately, the others (i.e., 6-hydroxyl (hypoxanthine) analogue 22 and 6-methylthio analogue 25) did not show any significant potency (EC 50 > 100 lM). Accordingly, the chloro group at the purine 6-position was considered to be important for the anti-HCV activity. 17\n\nThe luciferase assay described above revealed that compound 10 exhibited the maximum potency among the analogues. Next, in order to confirm the anti-HCV activity of 10, the replicon RNA levels were quantified by performing real-time RT-PCR analysis. 16 Fig. 4 shows the result obtained with 10 and ribavirin (positive control). Compound 10 reduced the replicon RNA amount up to approximately 45% at 12.5 lM and 6% at 25 lM, which is almost consistent with the result of the luciferase assay (EC 50 = 6.1 lM). Among these molecules, two compounds can be hypothesized to be species with real antiviral activity.\n\nOne is the 5 0 -O-masked 2 0 -deoxyadenosine analogue itself such as 10, and the other is the deprotected 9 (or its activated form, 5 0 -triphosphate) since carboxylic ester bonds are often hydrolyzed in cultured cells, as reported earlier. 18 However, the chemically stable 5 0 -O-masked analogues 20 and 21 (Bn and allyl ether, respectively) showed anti-HCV potency to some extent. Moreover, the deoxyadenosine derivative 23, which would be transformed to the inactive 2 0 -deoxyadenosine after the hydrolysis, also showed potency. Thus, taking these results into consideration, it would be reasonable to consider that some 5 0 -O-masked analogues themselves possess the anti-HCV potency. On the other hand, it would also be reasonable to consider that compound 9 (or its 5 0 -triphosphate) is one of the real active species since 9 also exhibited anti-HCV activity, though only moderately; in other words, compound 10 operates as a prodrug of 9. 19 Therefore, at this stage, we believe that both compounds (e.g., 9 and 10) would function as the species with antiviral activity in the cells.\n\nA series of nucleoside analogues 5-25 were synthesized and their abilities to inhibit HCV RNA replication were evaluated. Among these, several 5 0 -O-masked analogues of 6-chloropurine-2 0 -deoxyriboside, such as 10, 17, and 20, exhibited effective anti-HCV activity. In particular, 5 0 -O-benzoyl analogue 10 exhibited the highest activity. Presently, we hypothesize two roles for these 5 0 -Omasked analogues: One is the role as an anti-HCV agent by itself, and the other is as a prodrug of its 5 0 -O-demasked (deprotected) derivative.\n\nThere are two notable structural features of these potent compounds: one is the masked 5 0 -hydroxyl group, and the other is the 2 0 -deoxyribofuranosyl structure. In relation to the substituent group at position 6 of the purine base, the chloro group seems to be preferable. These unique features are rarely seen in common anti-HCV agents; therefore, although some issues such as improvement of the antiviral potency remain to be resolved, we hope that the present study will contribute to developing a new class of HCV therapeutic agents.
