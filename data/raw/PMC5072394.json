{"title": "Viral evasion of intracellular DNA and RNA sensing", "body": "Despite rapid advances in the development of antiviral drugs for some viruses, such as HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), there remains an alarming paucity of antiviral drugs for many other clinically important viral pathogens. The continued emergence of new and previously known viral pathogens, as well as drug-resistant variants, highlights the urgent need for the development of novel and more effective vaccines and antivirals to combat viruses and mitigate human disease.\n\nAs obligate intracellular parasites, viruses require the host cell machinery and resources to replicate and propagate. Mammalian cells have evolved elaborate defence mechanisms to detect and inhibit viral replication. In turn, this has led to the emergence of viruses that are adept at manipulating and subverting host immune responses, which leads to enhanced virus-induced pathogenesis. These human-pathogenic viruses continue to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, as exemplified by the swine flu pandemic caused by the H1N1 subtype of influenza A virus in 2009 and the Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa in 2014. Therefore, an understanding of how viruses evade or antagonize the host antiviral response at the molecular level could guide the design of live attenuated vaccines and the development of new antiviral drugs. Furthermore, detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms by which infected cells sense viral pathogens may enable us to use the immune system for antiviral therapeutics.\n\nImmediately after viral infection, the innate immune response is initiated by germline-encoded molecules termed pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRRs recognize conserved features of viruses and other microorganisms, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which include microbial nucleic acids, proteins and carbohydrates. Generally, these innate immune sensors can be categorized into two major classes depending on their subcellular location. PRRs that recognize extracellular PAMPs are typically found on the plasma membrane or endosomal membranes, and include the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the C-type lectin receptors (CLRs)1,2. In most cases, these membrane-bound PRRs are predominantly expressed in immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. By contrast, intracellular PRRs are found in the cytoplasm or nucleus of mammalian cells, and include the NOD-like receptors (NLRs; also known as nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing proteins), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and a group of intracellular DNA sensors that includes cyclic GMP\u2013AMP synthase (cGAS) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3)-inducible protein 16 (IFI16)3. These intracellular sensors are widely or ubiquitously expressed, which enables the detection of viral pathogens after invasion of the cytoplasm and/or nucleus in almost all cell types in a mammalian host.\n\nFollowing the recognition of PAMPs, PRRs initiate innate immune signalling through the hierarchical activation of a PRR family-specific adaptor protein (for example, mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS), stimulator of IFN genes (STING) or MYD88), as well as a common set of well-studied serine/threonine kinases and transcription factors. PRR-mediated signal transduction ultimately leads to the production of numerous host defence molecules, including type I and type III IFNs, and other pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Secreted IFNs are able to signal through their receptors in an autocrine and paracrine fashion to induce the expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs)4. Proteins that are encoded by ISGs then target crucial steps in the viral life cycle and also regulate innate immune sensing and the production of cytokines, thereby establishing an antiviral state. Cytokines and chemokines that are produced following the activation of PRR signals are also crucial for shaping an effective adaptive immune response.\n\nViruses have evolved effective mechanisms to avoid detection by innate immune sensors, or to inhibit the activation of PRRs and/or their downstream signalling cascades. In this Review, we discuss the cell-intrinsic mechanisms that are used to sense viral pathogens in infected host cells, with a focus on RLRs, cGAS and IFI16, which are key intracellular sensors of viral RNA or viral DNA. Furthermore, we describe the strategies used by viral pathogens to evade or subvert the innate immune response that is mediated by these sensors, with a focus on recently published work and clinically important viruses. These evasion strategies fall into four broad categories: the sequestration or modification of viral nucleic acids; interference with specific post-translational modifications of PRRs or their adaptor proteins; the degradation or cleavage of PRRs or their adaptor proteins; and the sequestration or relocalization of PRRs. Finally, we detail how a comprehensive understanding of the manipulation of immune surveillance pathways by viruses may guide the design of antiviral therapeutics and vaccines, or help to improve the immunogenicity of viral vectors.\n\nAs cGAS and IFI16 are expressed in most host cells, all DNA viruses have to contend with these intracellular DNA sensors and escape immune signalling during both acute and persistent infection. In addition, retroviruses, which produce viral DNA during their life cycles, and other RNA viruses, inhibit cGAS and/or STING; however, in many cases the contribution of cGAS and/or STING antagonism to viral pathogenesis remains to be fully established.\n\nSequestration of viral genomes. The virions of HIV-1 carry a ssRNA genome, which is reverse-transcribed into DNA inside the infected host cell in preparation for chromosomal integration. As only a few copies of HIV-1 DNA integrate, the remaining copies are potentially vulnerable to detection by cytosolic sensors. It has been shown that HIV-1 uses the host 3\u2032-repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1), the most abundant 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 DNase in cells, to bind to and degrade excess cytosolic HIV-1 DNA109 (Fig. 4). The loss of TREX1 in host cells that are infected with HIV-1 led to an accumulation of HIV-1 reverse transcripts and triggered the production of IFN through STING, thereby preventing HIV-1 replication and spread. More recently, it has been reported that cGAS senses HIV-1 DNA and subsequently activates STING38, which suggests that the TREX1-mediated degradation of HIV-1 DNA enables the evasion of the sensor cGAS. Furthermore, two studies have shown that the capsid of HIV-1 (and also HIV-2) prevents the cGAS-dependent sensing of HIV complementary DNA (cDNA) by recruiting cellular proteins, such as cyclophilin A (CYPA)110,111; however, how CYPA prevents the activation of cGAS by HIV cDNA is unclear and remains to be determined.\n\nViral manipulation of STING post-translational modifications. HBV causes chronic hepatitis and increases the risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. A recent study has shown that the reverse transcriptase and ribonuclease H domains of the HBV polymerase bind to STING to block its Lys63-linked ubiquitylation, thereby inhibiting the production of IFN\u03b2112 (Fig. 4). The PLPs from human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), SARS-CoV and porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV), all of which are RNA viruses, have also been shown to associate with STING and block its dimerization and Lys63-linked ubiquitylation, thereby suppressing the activation of IRF3 (Refs 113,114,115). Therefore, SARS-CoV uses PLP to antagonize the Lys63-linked ubiquitylation of both RIG-I and STING (see above). Furthermore, it has been reported that the NS4B protein of HCV associates with STING, but the physiological relevance of this interaction remains to be fully elucidated116,117. A recent study has shown that the DNA tumour viruses human papillomavirus 18 (HPV18) and human adenovirus 5 (hAd5) inhibit the cGAS\u2013STING pathway using their viral oncoproteins E7 and E1A, respectively118. E7 and E1A specifically bind to STING, but not to cGAS, although the authors did not study whether the dimerization and/or ubiquitylation of STING were affected by this interaction. Interestingly, the disruption of the cGAS\u2013STING pathway was dependent on the LXCXE motif in the viral oncoproteins, which has previously been shown to be crucial for viral inhibition of the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor pathway. This finding suggests that the antagonism of innate immune signalling and the inactivation of tumour suppressor function share common mechanistic features. As many human DNA viruses encode proteins with LXCXE motifs, this study proposed that these viral proteins may represent a broad class of STING antagonists. Apart from the viral antagonism of STING dimerization and ubiquitylation, a recent study has shown that KSHV, the causative agent of Kaposi sarcoma and several lymphoproliferative diseases in humans, encodes viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF1), which interacts with STING, thereby preventing TBK1 binding and TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of STING and STING activation119. Notably, the authors screened more than 80 KSHV-encoded proteins for their ability to suppress cGAS\u2013STING signalling and identified five other viral proteins that could inhibit this pathway. This indicates that KSHV and possibly other DNA viruses may encode numerous strategies to escape antiviral responses that are initiated by cGAS. In addition, the DUB ORF64 from murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) was recently shown to antagonize viral DNA sensing in a STING-dependent manner120.\n\nCleavage or degradation of DNA sensors and STING. As with most DNA viruses, HSV-1, which causes cold sores and can lead to encephalitis and keratitis, replicates in the nucleus and thus must counteract immune sensing in this cellular compartment. In agreement with this, infection with HSV-1 has been reported to trigger the proteasomal degradation of IFI16 in the nucleus (Fig. 4). A study has shown that HSV-1 mutants that lack the viral E3 ubiquitin ligase infected cell protein 0 (ICP0) or encode a catalytically inactive mutant of ICP0 failed to degrade IFI16, which suggests that ICP0 directly targets IFI16 for degradation121. In support of this, ICP0 binds to IFI16 and recruits it to ICP0-containing foci in the nucleus prior to degradation121. However, the expression of ICP0 alone does not cause the degradation of IFI16 (Refs 122,123), and an ICP0-deficient HSV-1 mutant that was complemented with the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) transactivating protein IE1 to promote viral gene expression was able to degrade IFI16 (Ref. 122). These results indicate that ICP0 either directly targets IFI16 for degradation, or promotes the expression of another viral product that does so. With regard to STING, the protease complex NS2B\u2013NS3 of DENV binds to and cleaves human STING to inactivate its function and to reduce the induction of IFNs124,125. By contrast, NS2B\u2013NS3 fails to cleave mouse STING, which does not harbour the cleavage site found in human STING; this suggests that STING is a species-specific restriction factor of DENV replication. These findings, together with previous work that showed that the NS3\u2013NS4A protease complex of the related HCV cleaves MAVS, highlight the convergence of DENV and HCV proteases on adaptors of DNA and RNA sensors (Fig. 4).\n\nSequestration or relocalization of DNA sensors. Recently, the tegument protein ORF52 of KSHV was shown to antagonize cGAS signalling126. ORF52 binds to both DNA and cGAS, thereby blocking the enzymatic activity of cGAS and decreasing the production of the second messenger cGAMP. Furthermore, the authors found that ORF52 homologues from other gammaherpesviruses, such as EBV and MHV68, also antagonized the activity of cGAS, which supports a conserved immune evasion function for ORF52. Together with vIRF1 from KSHV, which binds to and antagonizes STING, these findings demonstrate that gammaherpesviruses target both the sensor and adaptor proteins for efficient immune evasion. HCMV is a major cause of birth defects and is responsible for complications in patients who are immunosuppressed. HCMV targets IFI16 through a different mechanism than HSV-1 (Fig. 4). Although IFI16 is able to recognize HCMV DNA, the tegument protein pUL83 binds to the pyrin domain of IFI16, which prevents the oligomerization of IFI16 and subsequent immune signalling127. pUL83 uses its N terminus to bind to IFI16 and its C terminus to dissipate IFI16 oligomerization, which implies a concerted mechanism. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of Ser364 of pUL83 decreased its ability to antagonize IFI16, which suggests that host kinases can modulate the immunosuppressive activity of this viral protein. Notably, the potent ability of pUL83 to sequester IFI16 is probably owing to the fact that it is the most abundant virion component of HCMV, with more than 2,000 copies per mature virion128. More recently, a second complementary mechanism of IFI16 antagonism by HCMV has been proposed129. During HCMV replication, IFI16 translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and mislocalizes to multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which prevents the detection of HCMV DNA in the nucleus. The authors found that the viral kinase pUL97 binds to and phosphorylates IFI16 and is required for IFI16 nuclear egress, which is consistent with the described role of pUL97 in the HCMV nuclear egress complex (Fig. 4). However, similar to the degradation of IFI16 by ICP0 from HSV-1, the introduction of pUL97 alone into cells did not trigger the translocation of IFI16, which suggests that other HCMV components are required. Interestingly, after translocating into MVBs, IFI16 seems to be incorporated into newly assembled HCMV virions, but the functional significance of this phenomenon has yet to be determined.\n\nThe past decade has seen rapid advances in our understanding of intracellular viral RNA and DNA sensors and how their activities are regulated. Fundamental principles that govern these sensors are emerging, such as the crucial roles of phosphorylation and the different forms of ubiquitylation in controlling the activation of PRRs, and some of the molecular features that distinguish 'non-self' PAMPs from host-derived nucleic acids. However, several gaps remain in our understanding of intracellular innate immune sensing. For example, RNA viruses and DNA viruses, such as DENV and HBV, antagonize both intracellular viral RNA and DNA receptors, indicating crosstalk between these two major sensing pathways, which remains poorly defined. Another conundrum concerns the spatial organization of individual intracellular sensors, and how they act in concert during an infection to elicit an effective host response. Furthermore, a better understanding of the physiological PAMPs that are recognized by intracellular pathogen receptors in an infected host cell would greatly aid in the design of immunostimulatory adjuvants or in prophylactic treatment.\n\nIn addition to the induction of IFNs and the activation of the inflammasome, the innate immune sensing of viral PAMPs can trigger autophagy130, and there is accumulating evidence that molecules that are involved in IFN-mediated innate immunity, such as cGAS, also have crucial roles in the regulation of this intracellular degradative process. It is essential to further our knowledge of how autophagy regulates immune and inflammatory responses so that this catabolic process can be harnessed for the development of antiviral therapeutics. Another exciting development in the field concerns the association of intracellular nucleic acid sensors with autoimmune diseases, such as Aicardi\u2013Goutieres syndrome, Singleton\u2013Merten syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. As PRRs are able to mediate potent immune and inflammatory responses, dysregulation of their activity can trigger autoimmunity. This typically occurs in two ways: gain-of-function mutations that lead to the constitutive activation of innate immune sensors, or mutations in cellular nucleases that are responsible for eliminating nucleic acids that may stimulate intracellular PRRs131. Elucidating the mutations and mechanisms that are responsible for the aberrant activation of PRRs may inform therapeutic interventions for autoimmune diseases.\n\nNumerous viral immune evasion mechanisms that specifically target intracellular PRRs have been uncovered, which highlight the importance of bypassing innate immune defence for viral replication and the common themes among strategies used by viruses. A key challenge is to translate this knowledge into useful applications for the development of new vaccines and antivirals. The ablation of specific viral PRR-antagonistic mechanisms while preserving other viral functions may give rise to live attenuated viruses, which are potential vaccine candidates. In particular, the elimination of several mechanisms of immune evasion from a viral pathogen may potently induce antiviral responses for long-lasting immunity, and also improve its safety profile. Similarly, the molecular mechanisms of viral immune escape may provide novel insights that may help to boost the immunogenicity of viral vectors for more effective vaccination. In addition, small-molecule inhibitors that target the interactions between viral proteins and crucial host immune molecules may act as potent antivirals and may increase the immune response of a patient. In certain cases in which an immune response is undesirable, such as gene therapy, it may be beneficial to use viral vectors with defined immune evasion mechanisms to prevent the early shutdown of transgene expression. In addition, new insights into the mechanisms by which overactive PRR signalling triggers inflammatory and/or autoimmune diseases could be useful for improving the immunogenicity of vaccines or reducing unwanted inflammation. Finally, the continuing emergence of viral variants that have increased virulence suggests that viruses can acquire novel strain-specific mechanisms of immune escape. Elucidating these strategies would shed light on viral evolution and provide molecular signatures for epidemiological monitoring."}
