{"title": "Pediatric non-influenza respiratory viruses during pandemic influenza", "body": "To the editor: A new influenza A strain designated as pandemic H1N1 \u2044 09 was reported by the World Health Organization in June 2009 and was declared as the first pandemic agent of the 21st century. 1 In Turkey, the Ministry of Health informed the public extensively regarding both the disease and existing vaccination options. The Ministry also prepared services at hospitals in case of a possible outbreak.\n\nBecause our clinic was appointed to provide care in the case of a possible outbreak, we wished to determine whether the causative agent in pediatric patients admitted to Istanbul University Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty between November 5, 2009, and March 10, 2010, with flu-like illness was influenza A (H1N1) or other respiratory tract viruses. In our study, influenza A (H1N1) and other respiratory tract viruses (adenovirus, coronavirus 43, coronavirus 229, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza 1-3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A, RSV B, rhinovirus) were investigated by testing 187 nasal and nasopharyngeal secretions, taken from 182 patients, using Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) (Seeplex RV 12 ACE Detection; Seegene, Seoul, South Korea). Multiplex PCR was performed using a dual priming oligonucleotide (DPO) system, and the results were analyzed in 2% agarose gel.\n\nThe average patient age was 3AE22 and the range was 2 months-16 years old. Of a total of 139 samples, 84 samples contained one, 23 samples contained two, and three samples contained three different viruses. The following agents were found from positive samples: influenza A (H1N1) (63 \u2044 45AE3%), parainfluenza 3 (18 \u2044 13%), rhinovirus (16 \u2044 11AE5%), coronavirus 229 (8 \u2044 5AE8%), RSV A (7 \u2044 5%), RSV B (7 \u2044 5%), parainfluenza 1 (6 \u2044 4AE3%), adenovirus (5 \u2044 3AE6%), parainfluenza 2 (5 \u2044 2AE9%), metapneumovirus (4 \u2044 2AE9%), and coronavirus 43 (1 \u2044 0AE7%) (Figure 1 ). In addition to flu-like illness symptoms, 31AE2% of the virus-positive patients had findings of bronchiolitis and 6AE3% had a previous diagnosis of asthma and presented with an attack of asthma.\n\nCarhan et al. 2 analyzed 1157 samples from nine different provinces in their surveillance studies between November 2007 and May 2008. Of the 1157 samples, 337 samples tested positive. The ratios were influenza A (55AE8%), influenza B (26AE1%), parainfluenza (8%), adenovirus (7AE1%), RSV A (3%), and RSV B (3%). These ratios were obtained 2 years before the pandemic. However, they are similar to the ratios we have found during the pandemic.\n\nIn 2009, a Greek study on viruses causing influenza-like illness, using different methods, tested 58 patients from three centers. Their results showed the following incidences and ratios: 39 cases of rhinovirus (67%), 15 cases of adenovirus (26%), 11 cases of influenza virus (19%), 6 cases of coronavirus (10%), three cases of parainfluenza virus (5%), and one case of bocavirus (2%). 3 In the study, the highest detection ratio was in samples obtained by nasal washing. In Spain, 183 pharyngeal swabs were tested from patients The last pandemic season reminds us that during the winter season, in addition to influenza A, other significant respiratory viruses should not be overlooked.
