{"title": "Evaluation of Sensitivities and Specificities of SARS-CoV Detection by Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR Assays *", "body": "The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 seriously harmed public health and the global economy, impacting more than 30 countries and claiming nearly 8400 cases with over 800 fatalities (2, 7, 10) . It was caused by a novel coronavirus, never recognized or characterized before, the SARSassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (2, 7, 10) .\n\nSince the disease is highly contagious and diagnosis in the early phase of infection is critical for patient care, it is important to develop a rapid and sensitive diagnostic assay for monitoring and containing the disease. To date, three types of diagnostic tests were developed: propagation of the virus in tissue culture, detection by antisera, and reverse transcription-PCR assays. However, virus propagation in tissue culture is relatively time consuming, requires special expertise and rather extensive facilities, since SARS-CoV is a biosafety level 3 pathogen. Serology has been proven to be sensitive but may require up to 20 d for serologic conversion (9) . Therefore, RT-PCR, especially Realtime quantitative RT-PCR, which is fast and convenient for detection of SARS-CoV, has widely become the method of choice for virus detection.\n\nMost of the published Real-time quantitative PCR assays target the viral N and Replicase 1b. It has been reported that N-gene-specific PCR provides stronger fluorescence signals and lower C T values than Replicase 1b gene PCR (1, 3, 4, 6) . A Taqman amplicon targeting the N gene is 5 log10 times more sensitive for SARS-CoV target RNA extracted from infected cells and 2.79 log10 times more sensitive for RNA extracted from patient material than an amplicon targeting the polymerase gene (11) . These data suggested that detection based on the N gene is more sensitive than detection based on the Replicase 1b gene, but the efficiency and sensitivity of detection based on other genes of SARS-CoV have never been reported. In this study, we have quantified SARS-CoV mRNAs in both cell culture lysates and in supernatants by using Real-time quantitative RT-PCR based on EvaGreen TM dye and Taqman-MGB probe.\n\nFor extensive evaluation of sensitivities and specificities, 13 pairs of primers and 4 probes were designed based on different genes of SARS-CoV (Replicase 1b, S, 3a, 3b, E, M, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and N). At the same time, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was selected as the internal control gene to normalize the amounts of input RNA in each single reaction (5, 8, 12) . We believe the experimental results may provide useful data for SARS-CoV detection in laboratory.\n\nViral RNA was extracted from lysates and supernatants of Vero E6 cell infected with BJ01 strain (GenBank accession number AY278488) and WH20 strain (GenBank accession number AY772062) of SARS-CoV with TRIzol (Invitrogen). One microlitre of RNA was extracted from 25 microlitre specimens.\n\nRNAs were stored at -80\u2103.\n\nThe SARS-CoV strain used to produce standard curve in this study was isolated from a SARS patient infected with the WH20 strain (GenBank accession number AY772062). The fragment of WH20 cDNA, that extends from Replicase 1b to N genes, was previously prepared in our laboratory. The primers and probes sets ( Table 1) The RNA concentrations were determined with a Lambda 25 UV spectrometer and converted to copy numbers. Each mRNA was serially diluted 10-fold from 10 10 copies to 10 1 copies per microliter and stored at -80\u2103. 69 1052-1069 a The locations of different genes of SARS-CoV were based on the WH20 strain (GenBank accession number AY772062).\n\nThe location of GAPDH gene was based on Homo sapiens (GenBank accession number AF261085). b Primers and probes used in Taqman-MGB Real-time quantitative RT-PCR.\n\nThe Real-time quantitative RT-PCR assays based on EvaGreen TM dye (Biotium, Inc.) were performed on an Opticon DNA engine (MJ Inc.) by using a Onestep RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN). Thermal cycling was set for 38 cycles and fluorescence measurements were taken after each cycle.\n\nPrimers and probes were designed based on sequences of GAPDH and 1b, S, E and N genes of the WH20 strain of SARS-CoV (Table 1 ). The Taqman-MGB Real-time quantitative RT-PCR assays were performed on an Opticon DNA engine (MJ Inc.) by using a One-step RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN).\n\nThe length of an in vitro transcribed RNAs, concentrations and copy numbers per microlitre are listed in Table 2 .\n\nEach mRNA was serially diluted 10-fold from 10 10 copies to 10 1 copies per microlitre. Standard curves showed that there were strong linear relationships (r 2 > 0.99) between the logarithms of the transcript copy numbers and the mean C T values. (Data not shown). \n\nWe used Taqman-MGB Real-time quantitative RT-PCR with the primers and probes based on the 1b, S, E and N genes and on the Homo sapiens gene GAPDH, to quantify mRNAs from the BJ01 and WH20 viral strains. Each run contained three replicates and the data are summarized in Table 4 . The data demonstrated that the results were reproducible with a mean coefficient of variation (CV) in the logarithm values of copy numbers of less than 10% (range, 1.38 to 9.29%) ( Table 5 and Table 6 ). The results are shown as the mean N = mean starting copy number of target gene / mean starting copy number of reference gene GAPDH. The quantification results indicated that the sensitivities and specificities of different gene-specific primer pairs and probes of SARS-CoV were quite different from each other, and provided clues for optimized molecular detection of SARS-CoV. From our results, primers and a probe based on the S gene, especially the S 1 primers, were most sensitive and efficient, and may be used for diagnosis in specimens obtained during the early infection phase. In practice, we had to accept the fact that the S gene sequence was not conserved among the different strains and was prone to mutation. This caused us much concern in using the primers and probe based on the S gene despite having the best sensitivity for detection. Therefore, people opted to choose primers and probes based on conserved genes, such as N or Replicase 1b (1, 3, 4, 6, 11) . From our result and five other independent laboratories (1, 3, 4, 6, 11) , the N gene was more sensitive than the Replicase 1b both in cell culture and patient materials, which makes it suitable for molecular detection of SARS-CoV."}
