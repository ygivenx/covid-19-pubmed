{"title": "", "body": "At the outset of a potential epidemic, a priority is to assess whether the new disease will spread on a sustained basis-the assessment of transmissibility. 1 The most widely used metric is the basic reproduction number, R 0 . However, early estimates of this epidemiological construct are sometimes given unwarranted emphasis in assessment of pandemic potential, as discussed by Romulus Breban and colleagues in The Lancet. 2 A more nuanced understand ing of pathogen emergence and R 0 is needed to formulate appropriate disease-control policies. R 0 , similar to most statistical constructs, represents a distribution, and might have region-specifi c or population-specifi c hetero geneities resulting from biological and contextual factors. Initial epidemiological assessments are often based on nonrepresentative cases and can be biased. We discuss specifi c examples relevant to emerging infl uenza strains and coronaviruses, but the notions are generalisable to the emergence of any pathogen.\n\nThe fundamental importance of R 0 is that when it is more than 1, even slightly, self-sustaining exponential growth of case numbers becomes possible (ie, an epidemic can occur, and is likely to do so as R 0 surpasses about 1\u00b75-2). However, the R 0 of a particular pathogen is not one number, but is the mean of population distributions of infectivities and contact patterns. For example, Mary Mallon (known as Typhoid Mary) was a cook whose role in food preparation made her personal R 0 (the number of secondary cases of infection deriving from direct or indirect contact with typhoid bacilli she shed) probably far higher than the population average; she is thought to have infected 54 others with Salmonella typhi. 3 The detection of Mary Mallon as a shedder of S typhi might be related partly to the fact that she had such a high personal R 0 . Such interindividual variability has been referred to as superspreading, 4 and has been documented for several pathogens. 5 These nuances should be considered in assessments of emerging respiratory pathogens such as infl uenza A (H7N9) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 6, 7 Breban and coworkers' fi ndings 2 suggested that MERS-CoV does not pose a pandemic threat, because the mean R 0 for this pathogen (based on mean reported cluster sizes) is less than 1. We do not disagree with this conclusion, but would argue that such an analysis is overly simplistic for several reasons. For example, in a similar analysis 8 we came to similar conclusions with regard to the mean R 0 of MERS-CoV, but noted that a 22 case cluster (the size of the largest cluster reported at that time) would be unlikely-a probability of about 0\u00b708%, similar to that of getting 10-11 heads in a row if tossing a fair coin-with an R 0 of 0\u00b776 (fi gure).\n\nIndeed, the divergence of reported cluster sizes from expectations emphasises the importance of hetero geneity in R 0 to assessment of risk. We suggest that the R 0 for MERS-CoV could be quite diff erent in a health-care setting from that reported in the community. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was pre dominantly spread in hospitals, might have had such heterogeneity; although it did not cause a large community-based pandemic, it was extremely disruptive.\n\nEstimated reproductive numbers can diff er substantially in diff erent geographies or populations according to the presence of disease-control infrastructure (eg, water improvement resources), diff ering contact patterns (eg, crowding), or the time of year at which R 0 is estimated. 9 Eff ective reproductive numbers (the product of R 0 and the fraction of the \n\nUnsurprisingly, anxiety and other emotional problems are common in general medical practice. Not infrequently, anxiety focuses on the possibility of serious disease that is not in fact present. Fashions in terminology exist, and the current terms in vogue for this latter state are health anxiety or hypochondriasis. 1 As with much of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders lexicon, the diagnostic threshold is low and prevalences in the order of 15-20% are reported across clinical settings. 2 Despite the absence of underlying disease, aff ected patients might be badly troubled by symptoms, and use many resources for investigations and searches for treatment. No surprise again that cognitive behaviour therapy is the most widely recommended intervention, 3 although the evidence is not strong. Access is typically poor, with insuffi cient accredited practitioners and long waiting lists in traditional mental health service settings. 4 Signifi cant interest exists therefore in modifi ed shortened versions of therapy. For primary depression and anxiety, population that is susceptible) can diff er according to population demographic structure. 10 The 2009 infl uenza A (H1N1) virus had strikingly diff erent reproductive numbers, and thus very diff erent eff ects, in Indigenous Canadian populations and the general population of southern Canada. This diff erence might have resulted from diff erential crowding and a younger age distribution (those born before 1957 seem to have been protected against infection) in isolated First Nations reservations. 11 If the mean value of R 0 is fi xed, heterogeneity caused by diff erences between individuals in one setting (eg, superspreaders 5 ) or by diff erences between settings (hospital vs community) both increase variation in cluster size and reduce the probability that any particular individual infection will cause an epidemic. 4 Pandemic risk estimates based on early, scarce information should be interpreted with caution, because the identifi cation of highly infectious individuals and severe cases is more likely, and because of the greater availability of surveillance resources in high-income populations where transmission characteristics of patho gens might be atypical. 12 As with any high-quality science, pandemic risk assessment as applied to emerging infectious diseases needs to incorporate many datapoints derived from unbiased epidemiological studies, ideally in the context of transparent information sharing and scientifi c cooperation.
