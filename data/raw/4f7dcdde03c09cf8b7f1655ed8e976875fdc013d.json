Public transport had been reduced to half at January 26 th , 2020 and reduced to less than 5% at February 7 th , 2020. Close contacts were defined as passengers in the same carriage of a train, ship or airplane with the diagnosed patients. Once these close contacts were found, they would be isolated for medical surveillance or treatment. At January 26 th , 2020, when a definite diagnosis had been made on 10 patients in Zhuhai, Zhuhai citizens were required to wear facial masks at all public occasions, and transgressors would be punished by the police owing to violate Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases. All the students attended class online at home after the semester was postponed. And all residential areas adopted close management. CDC required that residents back to Zhuhai isolated themselves at home for 14 days. The government of Zhuhai established a series of measures and policies to support the many mid-minor enterprises during such a long-term termination of business, including labour subsidies, scientific research input, loan discounts, tax relief, etc. Zhuhai CDC established ten emergency response teams for epidemiological investigation, case report, specimen collection, epidemic sites disinfection, close contacts management, emergency monitoring, health education, risk assessment, technical guidance, etc. Medical staff were sent to bus stations, quays, rail stations and airports for screening suspicious cases. Fever clinics in Zhuhai are opened around the clock.\n\nIn clinics, patients with body temperatures over 37.3\u2103were guided to fever clinics for relative examination, and clinic patients were forbidden to enter inpatient departments without instruction. Each department in hospital reserved at least two wards for emergency isolation.\n\nMedical staff's cellphones, glasses, pens, and stethoscopes were especially disinfected.\n\nDisinfection of elevator buttons, public toilets, and clinic waiting-room benches was also increased. Training on cleaning staff was strengthened, and quality of protective clothing was more concerned than before. For doctors, morning shifts were reduced or completed on line to avoid gathering. Inspectors detecting the virus wear protective clothing, N95 masks and goggles, without touching the outside throughout operation, in order to strictly prevent the spread of 2019-nCoV.\n\nConsidering that COVID-19 has strong infection capacity, we should be on the alert to face this emergency. Policy-making should be based on resource integration, social mobilization, funding input, medication supply, vaccine development and international cooperation. And science and technology means should be fully utilized. The complex emergencies of communicable diseases should be fully understood, and this would be a process needing continuous learning. A highly reactive, multifunctional and efficient emergency management system would be established, and the significance of information communication should be fully understood in the future."}
