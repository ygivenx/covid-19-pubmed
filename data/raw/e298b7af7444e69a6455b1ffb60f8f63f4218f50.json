{"title": "", "body": "It is difficult to extrapolate from these data to susceptibility to coronavirus infection, and this analysis is further flawed by small numbers of infections and short placebocontrolled periods. Moreover, minor respiratory infections may be under-reported, and some infections may be reported doubly as upper respiratory infections and as nasopharyngitis.\n\nNonetheless, this data may be used to decide whether to continue biologic therapy during pandemics. We do not know if biologic therapies render patients more susceptible to coronavirus, but we know that in a pre-coronavirus era, respiratory infection rates were comparable to placebo. Conversely, discontinuation of some biologics can result in loss of response when treatments are reintroduced or even result in the formation of antibodies to the discontinued biologic. [2] [3] [4] All of these factors must be considered when advising patients about continuing or discontinuing biologic therapies. "}
