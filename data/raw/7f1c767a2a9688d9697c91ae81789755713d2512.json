{"title": "A single holiday was the turning point of the COVID-19 policy of Israel", "body": "We analyzed epidemiological investigation reports during the first month of 49 the outbreak in Israel. In addition, we present a deterministic compartment model and 50 simulations of several scenarios emphasizing quarantine and isolation policies given 51 their efficiency. 52\n\nWe identify an abrupt change from controlled epidemic regime to an 54 exponential growth (\u0734 \u0d4c 2.19) in light of the actual policy-makers decisions and 55 public behavior in Israel. Our analysis show that before the abrupt change, the new 56 cases trend was due to returning citizens infected abroad. The abrupt change followed 57 a holiday in which social distancing was clearly inefficient and many public 58 gatherings were held. We further discuss three different modeled scenarios of 59 quarantine efficiency: high-, medium-, and low-efficiency. 60\n\nIsrael early lessons show that there is no allowance to compromise with the 62 directive of social distancing. Even before the onset of the pandemic in Israel, fine-63 tuned but determined early decisions were taken by policy makers to monitor flight 64 arrivals from Covid-19 affected regions and to limit public gatherings.

In this study we present the results 75 of epidemiological data and modelling of one month since the onset of the outbreak in 76\n\nIsreal, addressing public events occurring during this period and the sensitivity to a 77 number of public health measures focusing on social distancing (quarantine and 78 isolation). 79\n\nThe epidemiological data studied, consisting of 381 laboratory confirmed 80 COVID-19 cases, has been obtained from the epidemiological investigation reports 81 that were released by the Israeli Ministry of Health (Israeli Ministry of Health, 2020). 82\n\nThis allowed us to identify and separate the incoming from abroad (which policy 83 required to enter quarantine on arrival) to the local cases, thus analyzing the net 84 contribution of local infections. 85\n\nIn addition, we present an extended deterministic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, 86\n\nInfectious, and Recovered) model to simulate disease outbreak scenarios. In 87 particular, the model includes quarantine of asymptomatic suspected population 88 (exposed) and isolation of symptomatic and infectious patients. The model takes into 89 account the efficiency of the quarantine and isolation measures. We discuss three 90 different quarantine efficiency scenarios: high-efficiency, medium-efficiency, and 91 All rights reserved.

The resulting analysis from the epidemiological cases data are 92 discussed in light of public events and compared to model simulations. We analyze 93 and discuss an abrupt change from controlled epidemic regime to an exponential 94 growth regime in light of policy makers' decisions and public behavior. The data analyzed in this study was obtained from the epidemiological 108 investigation reports that were released by the Israeli Ministry of Health (Israeli 109\n\nMinistry of Health, 2020). From the total of 883 PCR laboratory confirmed COVID-110 19 cases we analyzed the 384 cases that were investigated epidemiologically, 111 allowing us to separate the incoming from abroad (quarantined on arrival by policy) 112 to local cases. This allowed us to separate the imported cases (travelers arriving from 113 abroad) from the locally infected cases. The data spans over the first month of the 114 COVID-19 outbreak in Israel, beginning in February 21 st 2020 and going until March 115 20 th .

A controlled high-efficiency quarantining (decaying green curve in 155 Fig. 2) . This regime is characterized by an early entry of asymptomatic 156 suspected population to home quarantine. Moreover we assume the 157 infectiousness in home quarantine is one sixth compared to free 158 asymptomatic. The efficiency of isolation is 70%. 159 2.
