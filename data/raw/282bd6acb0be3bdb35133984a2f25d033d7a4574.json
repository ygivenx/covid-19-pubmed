{"title": "Neurotropism of Mouse-adapted Haemagglutinating Encephalomyelitis Virus", "body": "Members of the family Coronaviridae cause various diseases in man and animals, and show fastidious requirements for in-vitro propagation. Murine hepatitis virus (JHM strain), a member of the coronaviruses, is neurotropic in mice and rats,.and the mechanisms of its viral persistency and demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) have been well studied (Stohlman and Weiner, 1981) . However, little information about the neurotropism of other coronaviruses has been reported.\n\nHaemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), a swine coronavirus, causes a vomiting-wasting disease, encephalomyelitis and inapparent infection in pigs of various ages (Mitchell, 1963; Mengeling et al., 1972) . We previously reported that HEV had neuropathogenic properties for mice, and that mice were resistant age-dependently to HEV (\u00a5agami et aI., 1986) . The present study was aimed at elucidating the neurotropism of HEV by in-vivo and invitro experiments in mice and murine cultured cells, respectively.\n\nThe 67N strain ofHEV, passaged 15 times in the brains of suckling mice, was used. A virus stock was prepared and viral infectivity assays were carried out as described by Yagami el al. (1986) . Briefly, 10-fold dilutions were prepared from a 10 per cent pooled suspension of three mouse brains, made in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing antibiotics and clarified by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 10 rain. Four 3-day-old suckling mice were inoculated intracerebrally (i.c.) with 5 ~1 of each dilution. The inoculated mice were observed daily for 10 days. The infectivity titre was calculated as the LD50 value.\n\nOutbred 3-and 42-day-oid ICR mice (SLCJapan Inc., Japan) were infected with the 67N strain ofHEV i.c. and intranasally (i.n.). Mice, lightly anaesthetized with ether, were inoculated with virus suspension (5 p.1; ca 5 UPs0 ) i.c. or i.n., on the right side, with a micropipette and 27-gauge needle. The infected mice, in groups of six, were observed every 12 h and kilied by bleeding under anaesthesia to collect several tissues at various stages of infection. Tissue specimens were used for viral re-isolation (three mice) and immunohistochemical observations (three mice). Animal experiments were performed humanely in accordance with the guidelines for animal experimentation of this University.\n\nSeveral routine cell lines [L-929 (fibroblast), Ehrlich-Lettre Ascites (ELA; epithelial), DBT (neuroglia), Neuro-2a (neuroblastoma) and NB41A3 (neuroblastoma)], and also primary or secondary cultured cells, [mouse embryonic (ME) cells, cultured neurons and astrocytes] were used to examine the in-vitro growth of HEV. L-929, ELA, Neuro-2a and NB41A3 were obtained fi'om the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC). Growth in Eagle's MEM (Nissui Co., Japan) was supplemented with 10 per cent fetal calf serum (FCS) and non-essential amino acids (for L-929, ELA, DBT and Neuro-2a). Growth in Ham's F-10 (Nissui) was supplemented with 20 per cent FCS (for NB41A3).\n\nNeuronal cell cultures were established from the cerebral cortex of mouse fetuses, aged 18 days, as follows. Neuronal cells, dissociated with 0'2 per cent trypsin (Flow Laboratories, Inc.) and 0\"01 per cent DNAse I (Sigma), were cultured on laminin (Sigma)-coated coverslips in SFM-101 medium (Nissui), supplemented with 1 per cent FCS. After 24h &culture, the medium was replaced with SFM-101 containing 10 -~ mM-cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C:Sigma) and maintained for a further 24 h, to inhibit the growth of fibroblasts. Subsequently, cultured neurons were used for viral inoculation and maintained with SFM-101 without Ara-C.\n\nAstrocyte cultures were also established from the cerebral cortex of mouse fetuses aged 18 days, by a method described for rat astrocytes (Kato el al., 1981) . The cerebral cortex sections were carefully separated from the meninges, to avoid contamination with fibroblasts. Dissociated cells were cultured in petri dishes containing F-10 medium supplemented with 20 per cent FCS. After 7 days of culture, dissociated cells were subcuhurcd in F-10 supplemented with 10 per cent FCS. The cultured neurons and astrocytes were identified by immunostaining with anti-neuron specific enorase rabbit serum (ZYMED Laboratories, U.S.A.) and with a monoclonal antibody [RC1; a specific immunohistochemical marker of radial glial cells (Edwards et al., 1990) ].\n\nThe virus propagated in mouse brain was inoculated into each of the cells and serially passaged two or three times, to avoid retention of the unadsorbed virus in the medium. At the secondary or tertiary passage, the cultured cells were examined for cytopathic effect (CPE) and specific immunofluorescent antigen (IFA). In addition, the infectivity of the culture medium was assayed by the method described above.\n\nViral antigen in paraffin-wax sections from infected mice was stained with anti-HEV rat serum, peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG rabbit serum (CAPPEL), and 0\"05 per cent 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. The sections were also counterstained with haematoxylin. Tissue sections from uninfected mice were used for control purposes. Similarly, HEV antigen in infected cultured cells was detected by the IFA method, with anti-HEV rat serum and fluorescein-conjugated anti-rat IgG rabbit serum (CAPPEL), after fixation with chilled acetone.\n\nViral distribution at intervals after inoculation was examined in i.e.-and i.n.infected newborn and adult mice. The results are shown in Table 1 . The infective viruses were limited to regions of the CNS, such as the olfactory bulb, the cerebrum and the cerebellum, with the exception of the lungs of i.n.inoculated newborn mice at an early stage of infection. The infectivity titres were much higher in the CNS than in lung. Viral propagation in i.e.-infected mice was more rapid than in i.n.-infected ones, although little difference was demonstrated between the maximal viral titres.\n\nSpecific viral antigen was observed in the neurons of the olfactory bulb, cerebrum and cerebellum but not in liver, spleen or kidney. In the newborn mice infected i.e., the viral antigens were scattered diffusely throughout the olfactory bulb, cerebrum and cerebellum, and were most prominent in the neurons of the cortex (layers II to V), in the hippoeampus and in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum 2 to 3 days after infection (Figs l a to l c). They were rarely localized in the glial cells. Similar findings were observed at the terminal stage (5 days after inthction) in i.n.-infected newborn mice. The antigen, however, was restricted to the olfactory bulb, trigeminal nerve and lower brainstern at an early stage (2 days after infection), suggesting neurotransmission through the tractus olfactorius and trigeminal nerve (Fig. ld) Three mice each were examined [br each point, and inI~ctlvi W of 10 pet\" cent pooled ~rgan suspenfiou was assayed. * Infectivity titre expressed as logl0 LD~J5 gl tbr 3-day-okl mice.

A high titre of virus was detected, particularly in NB41A3 cells, which showed a mild CPE and detachment. The CPE was not clear in infected neurons because complete monolayers of primary neuron cultures were not obtained, but virus titres similar to those in NB41A3 cells were detected. As for IFA in the infected cells, bright fluorescence was observed in NB41A3 cells and in primary cultured neurons. The antigen was widely distributed, not only in the perikaryon but also in the dendrites of cultured neurons. On the contrary, no antigen was demonstrated in L-929, DBT, ELA, mouse embryonic cells, or astrocytes (Figs 2a-d) .\n\nInfective virus was recovered from the culture medium of NB41A3 cells and neurons but not from other cell cultures. A high virus titre was shown in the growth medium of the infected NB41A3 cells.\n\nThe pathogenic mechanism of HEV infection in pigs appears to be quite different fi'om that of other coronaviruses. The disease is initiated as an inapparent infection of the respiratory tract, and the virus spreads via peripheral nerves to the CNS. Subsequently, the infection of neurons which regulate peristaltic functions of the digestive tract results in a vomiting disease ( Andries and Pensaert, 1980a, b) . In oronasally infected newborn pigs, the viral antigens have been demonstrated in epithelial cells of the tonsils at an early stage of infection and in neurons of the cortex, medulla oblongata, pons and midbrain at a later stage (Narita el al., 1989a, b) . In-vitro propagation of HEV has been reported only in primary and secondary cell cultures of swine kidney (Mengeling et al., 1972) and thyroid (Sato et al., 1983) , and in lined ESK and SK-K cells (Mengellng, 1973; Hirano et al., 1990) derived from swine kidney.\n\nIn the present study, propagation of HEV was strictly limited to neurons in infected mice, and to cultures of neurons and an established line of neuroblastoma cells (NB41A3). This is the first report of HEV proliferation in cultured neurons. These results provide sufficient evidence that HEV is a neurotropic virus. The lower titre of the virus in the lung ofi.n.-inoculated newborn mice than in the CNS may have been due to the uptake of virus by pulmonary macrophages or epithelial cells. It is probable that the HEV strain used had become more neurotropic for mice as a result of mouse brain passage. It would be interesting to ascertain whether its powers of propagation in pig brain had increased.\n\nIn the present study, HEV was capable of propagating in NB41A3 but not in Neuro-2a cells. Both NB41A3 and Neuro-2a have been independently established by cloning from a neuroblastoma (C-1300) in a strain A albino mouse, and both have retained the characteristics of neuroblastoma cells (Hay el al., 1988) . However, there are substantial differences between them. For instance, NB41A3 cells secrete ace@choline esterase together with the enzymes for the synthesis of the neurotransmitters, choline acetylase and tyrosine hydroxylase, as adrenergic neuron (Hay el al., 1988) , whereas Neuro-2a has not been shown to secrete these enzymes. Recently, Schultze el al. (1990) reported that I-IEV attached to an N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid-containing receptor which was destroyed by acetylesterase. These enzymes of NB41A3 might be related to the difference in HEV propagation between the two lines of neuroblastoma cells.\n\nPreviously, we demonstrated the age-dependency of mouse susceptibility to fatal HEV infection (Yagami et al., 1986 ). The present study shows additional differences between infected newborn and adult mice, particularly in the distribution of HEV antigen in the layers of the cerebral cortex. These findings resemble those ofOgata et al. (1991) in rats infected with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). These authors suggested that the neurotropism of JEV was dependent on the degree of neuronal maturation in the cortex, which paralleled a particular pattern of disappearance of antigen from the inner layers to the outer layers of the cortex. Further work is needcd to elucidate the relation between age-dependency of HEV infection and neuronal maturation, and localization of receptors on susceptible cells."}
