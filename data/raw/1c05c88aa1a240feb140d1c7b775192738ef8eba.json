{"title": "THE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO VIRUS INFECTIONS", "body": "antigens have been demonstrated in rhabdoviruses and retroviruses (Griffin and Compans, 1979; Bubbers and Lilly, 1977) . In place of these host proteins, viral coded proteins become substituted into the envelope. In most of the enveloped viruses, except the togaviruses, the envelope overlies a matrix protein which plays an important role in the assembly and release of the virions. In addition to the strutural proteins some viruses carry enzymes necessary for their replication.\n\nAlthough most viruses possess capsids with helical or cubic symmetry some have a more complex structure.\n\nRetroviruses have a helical nucleocapsid surrounded by an outer icosahedral capsid whilst pox viruses have an even more elaborate substructure of membranes and enzymes.\n\nVirus infections present the immune system with a range of proteins which are antigenic. The biological importance of a viral antigen is, however, largely dependent on its location and on the function of the antigen in viral replication. Neutralising antibody, that is antibody that renders a virus non-infectious, is directed towards antigens on the surface of virions.\n\nIn the case of enveloped viruses these are the glycoprotein spikes of the virus. Exceptions occur however. In bovine leukaemia virus infections, for instance, antibody is produced to glycosolated determinants, whereas immunisation with inactivated virus results in antibody to protein components (Portelle et al., 1981) . Cytotoxic T-cells also recognise carbohydrate (Ertl and Ada, 1981) and it has been suggested that genes in the major histocompatibility complex code for glycosyl transferases, which attach specific oligosaccharides to viral proteins to render them antigenic (Blanden et al., 1976) . The glycoproteins of the viral envelope are also expressed on the cell surface but in addition antigens not normally accessible at the surface of the virion can be found in the cell membrane. The matrix protein of influenza virus has been reported to be expressed at low levels on the cell surface (Hackett et al., 1980) and in feline leukaemia virus infections a novel antigen consisting of the glycosalated, internal antigen, precursor protein is expressed on the plasma membrane (Neil et al., 1980) .\n\nThe surface proteins of non-enveloped viruses are not glycosalated but, as in enveloped viruses they are targets of neutralising antibody. In addition, the surface proteins of both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses may bind to erythrocytes and haemagglutinate them. Antibody specific for the haemagglutinins of viruses will inhibit their haemagglutinating activity and this reaction provides a convenient method for measuring anti-virus antibody.\n\nThe maintenance of repeated epitopes, in a regular fashion, on the surface of viruses might be expected to indicate that these structures would function as thymus independent antigens. Experimental investigation of the humoral response of athymic nude mice (nu/nu) to virus infections has suggested, however, that the response to these antigens is either completely thymus dependent or requires a thymic function for switching from an IgM to an IgG response (Burns, 1975 \n\nAntibody is produced to internal antigens of viruses but these are not exposed in intact virions and therefore do not contain targets for \n\nThe nature of the immune response to viruses is governed in part by the relationship of the virus with the host cell. In examining these relationships it is convenient to consider the non-enveloped viruses and the enveloped viruses separately.\n\nViruses are obligate intracellular parasites dependent on host cell machinery for their replication. \n\nA property of the members of certain virus groups particularly those in the herpesvirus, retrovirus, and paramyxovirus groups is their ability to remain as latent infections. In this state the virus is represented in the host cell by its genome without the production of complete virions. In herpes virus infections the latent state is usually maintained in neurones or lymphoid tissue whilst in feline leukaemia virus infections (a retrovirus) latency is maintained in the bone marrow (Rojko et al., 1981) .\n\nReactivation from the latent state with the production of new virus particles can occur and in herpes virus infections this may also be associated with the recrudescence of clinical symptons. Amongst the agents associated with reactivation from latency are a range of immunosuppressive products.\n\nIn the case of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) the latent state appears to be associated with an active cellular and humoral immune response directed against the expression of viral antigens on the cell surface (Rojko et al., 1981 (Powell et al., 1974; Witter et al., 1975) .\n\nThe choice of test used to measure antibody responses to viruses is often based on pragmatic criteria. Complement fixation and enzyme ~linked immunosorbent assays provide easily automated screening tests for examining large numbers of samples in epidemiological surveys. When whole virus is used as antigen in these tests, however, subgroup specificity is often obscured by the group specific reactions. In those viruses that haemagglutinate, the haemagglutination inhibition test provides a quantitative assay that is inexpensive, quick to perform, and furthermore often subgroup specific.\n\nIn the range of available serological tests virus neutralisation occupies a special position since, by definition, it detects antibody that results in a loss of virus infectivity. Virus neutralisation assays therefore provide a means of assessing the protective humoral response in vitro. The assays are conducted in two stages; a virus of known titre is first incubated with heat inactivated serum under test and after an interval of 30 minutes to 1 hour the residual infectivity is measured in an indicator system. The sensitivity of the assay is largely governed by the sensitivity of the indicator system which is usually a permissive cell culture.\n\nMost neutralisation assays are conducted with a constant amount of virus and a variable (titred) serum concentration. In these assays antibody is usually in excess and, under these conditions, the percentage of surviving virus after neutralisation is independent of the initial quantity of virus employed.\n\nIn order to replicate a virus particle must bind to a target cell, enter it and finally uncoat to liberate its nucleic acid genome.\n\nNeutralising antibody has been shown to interfere with each of these functions.\n\nWhen the surviving fraction of virus is examined at different times in the nuetralisation reaction, curves illustrated in figure 2 are generated. In curve A an immediate decrease in the surviving fraction is observed with the same proportion of virus being neutralised in a given time interval. This pattern of 'one hit' kinetics has been taken to indicate that only a single antibody molecule is required to neutralise each virus particle. However when the same neutralisation reactions are conducted at low antibody concentrations, or low temperature, a change in the curve occurs with a lag in the onset of rapid neutralisation. This lag phase is consistent with a model proposed by Meynell and Meynell (1970) However the mechanism of neutralisation may be more complex as some evidence suggests that neutralised influenza virus adsorbs to, and uncoats in suitable host cells but transcription of the viral genome does not occur (Dimmock and Possee, 1981) . It has been suggested that virus-antibody complexes may activate cellular nucleases and this may account for the neutralisation of virus once it has entered a cell (Mandel, 1967) .\n\nIn adenoviruses the definition of critical sites is more complex.\n\nThe capsid consists of 240 hexon capsomeres and 12 penton base capsomeres arranged at the vertices of the icosahedron. Projecting from the penton base is a fibre; the complex of the fibre with the penton base being termed a penton ( Fig. 1 ).\n\nHexons possess distinct sites with group specific and type specific determinants, whereas type specific determinants predominate on the fibre (Norrby, 197l; Pettersson, 1971 ). Neutralising antibody is directed largely at the hexons, whilst anti-penton serum has only weak neutralising activity and anti-fibre serum hardly any at all (Kjellen and Pereira, 1968) . Although anti-penton serum has low neutralising activity, it considerably enhances the neutralising effect of anti-hexon antibody (Hierholzer and Dowdle, 1970) and furthermore anti-penton serum alone can have a significant neutralising capacity on the addition of antiglobulin (Norrby and Wadell, 1972) . This suggests that critical sites are not confined to hexons alone and that maximal neutralisation reactions involve antibody reactions at more than one site.\n\nA possible exception to multiple site neutralisation occurs in the Picornaviridae. For polio-virus it has been found that the combination of a single antibody molecule is associated with a change in the isoelectric point of the virus and this has been taken to indicate that a distortion in the capsid structure precedes neutralisation (Mandel, 1976 ). (Fig. 2) .\n\nThe rapid phase of neutralisation obeying first order kinetics is followed by a slower phase. This levelling off of virus neutralisation can be pronounced leaving a persistent fraction (Fig. 2) . Persistent fractions are more frequently observed with low avidity antibody, occurring early after infection or immunisation. This antibody disassociates from the virus-antibody complexes on dilution leading to reactivation of the virus (Lafferty, 1963) . It has been suggested that persistent fractions can also arise when the virus forms aggregates in which some virions are unavailable to the neutralising antibody. However persistent fractions have been observed when monodispersed virus and high avidity antibody have been used in the neutralisation reaction. Under these conditions the addition of further immunoglobulin to the persistent fraction does not result in additional neutralisation but when a Fab fragment is employed further neutralisation occurs (Ashe et al., 1969) . A reasonable interpretation is that the smaller Fab fragment is able to reach sites on the virion inaccessible to the larger intact immunoglobulin. This stearic inhibition of neutralising antibody could occur through the binding of antibody to non-critical sites leaving the critical sites available to interact with the host cell (Fig. 2) .\n\nAn increasing body of evidence indicates the importance of complement in the antiviral response. Complement can play a role in neutralising free virus and in eliminating virus infected cells. These activities are initiated in the following ways:\n\n(i) Immune activation of the complement pathway leading to virus neutralisation.\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii) Non-immune activation of the alternative or classical pathways of complement by virions or virus infected cells.\n\nEnveloped viruses should in theory be susceptible to damage through activation of the terminal phospholipase of the complement pathway. The addition of purified components of the complement system in sequence have been shown to enhance the neutralisation of equine arteritis virus-antibody complexes (Radwan and Crawford, 1974) .\n\nSimilarly the addition of complement to retrovirus-antibody complexes is associated with a loss of structural integrity of the viral envelope and a consequent loss of infectivity (Oroszlan and Gilden, 1970; 01dstone, 1975) .\n\nIn avian infectious bronchitis virus, a coronavirus, Berry and Almeida (1968) demonstrated punctate lesions in the envelope associated with lytic complement damage. However, they also found that neutralisation could occur without these lesions being evident, indicating that virolysis was not an absolute requirement for ablating infectivity.\n\nThese indications that virolysis is not necessarily a prerequisite for neutralisation of enveloped viruses have been confirmed by the addition of the early components of the complement pathway to herpes virus-antibody complexes (Daniels et al., 1970) .\n\nDuring the sequential addition of CI, C4, C2 and C3, significant neutralisation was first detected upon the addition of C4 and increased as C2 and then C3 were added. Neutralisation by these early components probably occurs through masking of cell receptors on the virion surface although aggregation of viral particles by C3 has been suggested as a possible mechanism (Oldstone et al., 1974) . The binding of C3b to the virion may also play an important role in the removal of the immune complexes by the phagocytic cell system whilst the anaphylatoxin C3a, generated during the cleavage of C3, promotes an inflammatory response that appears to be important in limiting the cell to cell spread of herpesviruses and paramyxoviruses.\n\nA striking feature of the alternative pathway of complement is that it can be activated in the absence of immunoglobulins. This may reflect the posited evolutionary origin of the alternative pathway as an amplification system for inflammatory reactions which, through later gene duplications, has formed the classical and terminal pathways (Lachman and Hobart, 1979) .\n\nThe essential featues of the alternative pathway are illustrated in Figure   3 . This pathway is a positive feedback cycle resulting in the cleavage of C3. (M~ller-Eberhard and GStze, 1972 It has been suggested that the alternative pathway is constantly 'ticking over' resulting in the random deposition of complement (Lachmann and Nicol, 1973) . Whether or not a continued deposition of C3b occurs on a paticular surface will be dependent on the extent that the bound C3b is available to factor H (Pangburn et al., 1980) . This hypothesis is illustrated in figure 3 in which the C3b binding site on \"activating surfaces\" masks or inactivates the factor H binding site and allows the formation of C3bBb. Activation of the alternative pathway in the absence of immunoglobu~in by virus infected (Sissons et al., 1980) and virus transformed cells (Budzko et al., 1976; McConnell et al., 1978) has been reported recently. Although activation of complement occurred without antibody, lysis of a range of human cells infected with enveloped viruses required both an intact alternative pathway and an anti-viral IgG. Even in the absence of lysis C3b coated cells could become susceptible to damage by phagocytic cells (Fig. 4C ).\n\nNon-immune activation of the complement pathway is also produced by virus particles. Retroviruses can be lysed by fresh human serum but not by serum from a number of other species (Welsh et al., 1975) . The activator for Cl on the virion surface appears to be PI5(E) which is analagous to the fusion proteins of other viruses (Bartholomew et al., 1978) . Welsh et al. (1975) and Cooper et al. (1976) have suggested that the capacity of serum to lyse retroviruses without antibody may be related to the absence of retrovirus viraemias in those species.\n\nIn this regard it is of interest that plasma viraemias of retroviruses occur in cats and that the serum of this species does not lyse retroviruses (N. Gorman pets. comm.).\n\nOther enveloped viruses are also associated with activation of the complement pathway although this activation is often dependent on the cells through which the virus has been passaged (Welsh, 1977) . Activation of the alternative pathway has been recorded for Newcastle's disease virus (Welsh, 1977) and for Moloney leukaemia virus (Bartholomew et al., 1978) although in the latter case activation was very weak and probably not of biological significance.\n\nA curious feature of the role of antibody in enveloped virus infections is that its presence is required for lysis of the cells yet it is not responsible for activation of the complement pathway. The presence of the early components of the classical pathway does not appear to be required (Perrin et al., 1976) and lysis of measles infected the HeLa cells can be produced by purified components of the alternative and membrane attack pathways (Sissons et al., 1979) . Properidin is also necessary for lysis and whilst neither IgG nor properidin influence the absolute binding of C3 to the target, the rate of binding is increased by IgG and the stability of C3bBb complex is increased by properidin. The combination of these processes may facilitate the formation of the C5 convertase and the subsequent assembly of the membrane attack complex (Sissons et al., 1979) .\n\nThe paramyxoviruses possess two envelope glycoproteins HN (or H) and anti-F antibody. In these circumstances the virus is still able to spread from cell to cell through fusion of adjacent plasma membranes since anti-F antibody is necessary to inhibit this activity (Fig. 5B ) (Merz et al., 1980) . Furthermore in the absence of anti-F antibody continued HN antigen presentation will occur in the form of virus released from the expanding syncitia. Antigen-antibody-complement complexes formed during this process may account for the immunopathological responses that have been observed in respiratory syncitial (RS) and measles virus infections (Chatterji and Mankad, 1977; Kim et al., 1969) . Interestingly the severest pneumonia in RS virus infections occurs in children with the highest neutralising antibody titres (Chanock et al., 1970) and RSV induced disease in cattle has been suggested to have an immunopathological component (Kim, 1977) .\n\nThere is an inherent problem in evaluating the significance of in vitro phenomena in terms of their biological relevance in vivo. Some doubt has been cast on the importance of complement mediated lysis since relatively large amounts of antibody are required to effect lysis. In the case of measles infected cells 6.5 x 107 molecules of IgG per cell were required for 50% lysis (Sissons et al., 1979 protection from tumour development .\n\nImmunopathology is a feature of many virus diseases but in some, it is infectious peritonitis (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Weiss and Scott, 1981) .\n\nIn these diseases the virus infection persists despite a vigorous humoral response. The continued production of virus antigen in the face of this antibody response results in the formation of immune complexes.\n\nEventually the formation of these complexes overwhelms the ability of the phagocytic system to degrade them, and they become deposited in glomeruli and arteries. Viruses from quite different groups are involved in immune complex disease but there are some interesting parallels in their biology.\n\nThe antibody produced to the virus may be non-neutralising, as in aleutian disease, and whilst neutralising antibody is produced in EIA infection it is clear that the virus does circulate in non-neutralised virus antibody complexes (McGuire, et al., 1972) . In EIA the disease is episodic and each new episode appears to be associated with antigenic variants that are not neutralised by antibody that was effective against viruses present earlier in the course of the disease (Kono, et al., 1973) .\n\nA second feature common to these viruses is that they replicate in macrophages, although this is not necessarily the major site of virus (Kohl et al., 1977; Shore et al., 1977) polymorphonuclear leucocytes (Gale and Zighelboim, 1975) and T-cells (Santoli and Koprowski, 1979) . In most species the main body of evidence suggests that the most efficient effector of k-cell activity, in the peripheral blood, is an Fc bearing cell in the 'null set' of mononuclear cells, that is, a non-adherent, E-rossette negative, surface Ig-cell (Greenberg et al., 1973) . However, different effector cells may act in different situations and there may be species differences in the effectiveness of cell populations to initiate ADCC.\n\nIn the dog ADCC activity against distemper infected cells has been produced by a null cell population comparable to the k-cells of man (Ho and Babiuk, 1979) whilst in cattle, ADCC to herpes virus infected cells was mediated most efficiently by neutrophils (Grewal et al., 1977) .\n\nIn the latter case however, it was found that neutrophils could also exert an antiviral effect which was distinct from ADCC and which did not require direct interaction between the neutrophil and the target cell .\n\nA feature of ADCC which suggests that it may be relevant in vivo is that relatively little antibody is required to sensitise cells in comparison to complement dependent cytotoxicity.\n\nHeLa cells are used as targets an estimated 5 x 105 antibody molecules per cell are required for sensitisation, a figure at least one order of magnitude lower than for complement mediated cytotoxicity (Perrin et al., 1977) . High concentrations of antibody may even inhibit ADCC, possibly as antigens are modulated from the target cells and the resulting complexes block the Fc receptor of the effector cell (Andersson et al., 1975) . The mechanism of lysis produced by the k-cell(s) is not understood but in most systems antibody must first bind to the target cell (Greenberg, 1977) .\n\nOnce this step has occurred the effector cells can interact with the Fc portion of the immunoglobulin molecule and effect the lytic process. In vitro the lytic process develops rapidly, membrane damage being detectable within a few minutes of plating the effector cells (Ziegler and Henney, 1975) . During this lytic phase, the kinetics of cell killing (measured by 51Cr release) demonstrate a 'one hit' pattern indicating that only a single effector target cell interation is necessary to produce lysis. In contradistinction to T-cell killing once the effector cell has bound to its target it is inactivated and unable to participte in further cytolytic actions (Ziegler and Henney, 1975) .\n\nThe signficance of ADCC in vivo is still not clear. Cytotoxicity to virus infected cells can be measured in vitro in two principal ways. In microcytoxicity assays adherent target cells are plated in microwells and the ability of lymphocytes to kill these targets over 1 to 2 days is measured by direct counting of remaining viable cells at the end of the assay (Takasugi and Klein, 1970) . Whilst this is a sensitive assay it is both time-consuming and subject to considerable variability.\n\nFurthermore it does not necessarily distinguish between cytotoxicity and growth inhibition. A more widely used test is the 51Cr release assay (Cerrotini and Brunner, 1974; Doherty et al., 1977) . (Takasugi et al., 1973; Kiessling et al., 1975) .\n\nAn intuitively attractive hypothesis of NK function is that these cells represent the same class of 'Null cell' that is responsible for ADCC and that the NK activity is due to 'pre-arming' of an Fc receptor by antibody.\n\nIn studies on human and murine NK cells some similarities to K cells have been reported (Kay et al., 1977; Santoni, 1979) .\n\nAlthough NK activity may be found in a non-adherent, mononuclear population in the peripheral blood of man, spleens of mice and the lymphoid compartments of cats (McCarty and ) pigs (Huh et al., 1981 chickens (Lam and Linna, 1977) and other species, it is not certain that these cells are identical to K-cells.\n\nshould render natural cell mediated cytoxicity (NCMC) susceptible to blocking by anti-lgG or the F(ab') 2 fragment of the anti-immunoglobulin.\n\nWhilst anti-immunoglobulin effectively blocks ADCC (Trinchieri et al., 1975 ) it fails to inhibit or only partially inhibits NCMC Kay et al., 1978; Pape et al., 1979) . Distinguishing between NCMC and ADCC activity does nevertheless, require the use of careful controls since NK activity is often measured in long assays during which antibody may be secreted in vitro from PBL. For instance the apparent increase in spontaneous cytoxicity of PBL after influenza virus vaccination has been shown to correlate with the ability to produce anti-haemagglutinin antibody in vitro (Greenberg et al., 1979) .\n\nA solution to the dichotomy between the similarity of the populations producing NK and ADCC activity and the difference in susceptibility of these responses to anti-immunoglobulin has been suggested by Santoli and Koprowski (1979) . They have proposed that ADCC and NCMC are different cytolytic processes mediated by the same population, a suggestion which is supported by the data of Ojo and Wigzell (1978) .\n\nMost information on the nature of the human NK cell suggests that it is a non-adherent surface Ig negative cell with an Fc receptor of low avidity.\n\nUsing human NK cells eluted from their targets, Saksela et al. (1979) found that most rosetted with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and displayed an acid a-napthyl acetate esterase staining pattern typical of lymphocytes. Santoli and Koprowski (1979) also found a proportion of the NK activity amongst a SRBC rosetting, IgG Fc +, population suggesting that the human NK cell may belong to the Tg-lymphocyte subset that can display suppressor cell activity (Moretta et al., 1977) . Murine NK cells exhibit the Ly5 9ene product also found on the surface of thymocytes, but not on B-cells or macrophages, (Cantor et al., 1979) . Furthermore they have either no or low expression of Thy-I antigen (Heberman et al., 1978) findings which would be consistent with murine NK cells belonging to an early stage in the T-cell lineage (Herberman and Holden, 1978) . More recent studies, however, suggest that these Ly5 positive cells may be related to basophils (Galli et al., 1982) .\n\nIn the mouse significant strain differences in NK activity have been observed and the level of this activity appears to be linked to genes in the major histocompatibility complex .\n\nApart from these strain differences a profound selective defect in NK activity has been recorded in homozygous beige mice (Roder and Duwe, 1979 7.4 Target cell specificity of NK activity NK cells appear to exhibit cytolytic activity against a wide range of cells but this activity appears to be highest against allogeneic cells (Hannson et al., 1978) and cells cultured in vitro, particularly lymphoid cells (Kiessling et al., 1975) . These differences in susceptibility to NCMC of different cell lines does not appear to be related to the acquisition of antigen from the culture media (Haller, 1978 ).\n\nAn important question therefore is the specificity of the recognition event by NK cells. Using a technique in which NK cells were depleted by binding to different target cells Kiessling and Wigzell (1979) found that depletion of NK activity was not specific for a particular target but correlated with susceptibility of the target to NCMC. Similar findings have been recorded for NK activity against virus infected cells; for whilst virus infected cells were more susceptible to NK activity than were their non-infected counterparts, cold competition and target absorption studies suggested that lysis was effected by a population capable of cytotoxicity against a range of target cells. Weston et al., 1981) .\n\nIn addition to their antiviral activity the interferons have a range of immunoenhancin9 and immunosuppressive effects (Epstein, 1977) . Included in the former is the enhancing effect of interferon on NK cell activity. and In addition to responding to exogenous interferon, the NK component of lymphocytes used in cytotoxic assays can be activated by interferon produced endogenously in assays from infected target cells. Consequently caution is required when interpreting the results of ADCC or T-cell mediated cytotoxicity assays against virus infected cells.\n\nA possible regulatory role for interferon in NCMC is suggested by the observation that interferon not only activates NK cells but also induces a protective effect against NCMC in normal uninfected fibroblasts. . When the thymus is ablated, susceptibility to enveloped viruses increases whilst immune responsiveness to non-enveloped viruses remains near normal (Blanden, 1970; Zisman, 1970; Rager-Zisman and The induction of cell mediated responses to viral antigens is associated with a number of events that can be monitored including a delayed hypersensitivity response, a proliferation of T-cells and the release of lymphokines including gamma interferon. However, the central event in T-cell mediated immunity is the destrution of virus infected cells by cytotoxic T-cells.\n\nA major development in the study of T-cell mediated immunity was the observation that the cytotoxic activity of murine T-cells was restricted to virus infected target cells bearing the same major histocompatibility (MHC)\n\nantigens.\n\nThe MHC restriction could be demonstrated for both cytotoxic effector functions, which required recognition of the gene products of the K and D region of the MHC, and for T-cell helper activities which were restricted by I region products (Zinkernagel and Doherty, 1974; Doherty and Zinkernagel, 1975; Z~nkernagel and Doherty, 1979) . is restricted, primarily to the MHC A product present on the irradiation resistant thymic epithelium. (Zinkernagel et al., 1978a) .\n\nSecondly, as pioneers of transplant surgery soon discovered, MHC products are strong antigens. It has been estimated that up to 10% of T-cells may specifically react with any foreign haplotype (Dutton, 1966; Swain et al., 1979) . This high degree of MHC polymorphism and associated alloreactivity presumably has an important role in governing the response to antigens. Thirdly, it is becoming clear that T-cells specific for a particular antigen bear idiotypes identical to antibodies specific for the same antigen (Binz and Wigzell, 1977) . At least part of the T-cell antigen receptor repetoire is, therefore, probably encoded by VH genes. However, unlike the VH genes expressed on B-cells which, it is believed, can be the products of somatic mutation during ontogeny, the VH genes of T-cells may be limited to those encoded in the germ line. This may account for the failure to observe an increase in the affinity of the T-cell receptor for antigen during the development of the immune response (Krawinkel et al., 1978) .\n\nWithin the constraints given above a number of models of antigen recognition by T-cells are possible. The extreme examples are the 'altered self' and the 'dual recognition' models ( Fig. 6) . Early discussions of the T-cell receptor centred on the altered self model in which it was assumed that antigen associated with the MHC product creating a conformational change in the latter. This altered MHC product could then be recognised by the single T-cell receptor.\n\nIn the dual recognition model it is envisioned that separate receptors exist for the MHC product and the antigen. An intermediate form of this model, the associative recognition model, involves a single receptor recognising an unmodified MHC product together with the antigen (Fig. 6 ).\n\nUntil recently dual receptor models have predominated (Cohn and Epstein, 1978; Zinkernagel et al., 1978b; Williamson, 1980) but this issue is still far from resolved and there has been a recent resurgence of the altered self hypothesis (Matzinger, 1981) . Whichever model is correct it is apparent that the recognition of the antigen in association with the MHC governs the extent of the immune response. The polymorphism of the MHC products in a species may have been maintained by the selective pressure of a variety of infectious diseases on the population, each evoking a distinct level of response with a given MHC product.\n\nMHC-restriction of T-cell cytotoxicity has been observed in other species including man. In species of veterinary interest indications of MHC restriction have been observed in the chicken in immunity to Rous-sarcoma virus infected cells (Wainberg, et al., 1974) . The apparent absence of MHC restriction in the cytotoxic reaction of cattle to IBR and vaccinia virus infections term culture. (Onions et al., 1980; Rojko et al., 1980) . In addition progress is now being made in defining the MHC products of a number of domestic animals including the dog (Vriesendorp, 1979) .\n\nThe development and regulation of the cytotoxic response requires interactions between distinct T-cell subsets and involves both T-cell help and suppression. The induction of the immune response is also dependent on macrophages (Zisman et al., 1970) which function as antigen presenting cells. This latter function is carried out by an la + group of cells which may be distinct from la-macrophages involved in removing antibody-complement-virus complexes. (Finberg and Benacerraff, 1981) .\n\nThe T-lymphocyte subsets involved in the murine immune response can be The early stages of the induction of the immune response involves the Lyt 1+2-3 -cell interacting with virus antigen presented on the surface of an la + macrophage. The helper cell requires two signals for its activation.\n\nOne is a specific signal provided by recognition of the antigen with the I region product, whilst the second is probably a nonspecific lymphokine, interleukin 1 (ILl) released by the antigen presenting cell. Once activated, the helper cell can produce interleukin 2 (IL2). This factor may have a role in enhancing the differentiation of Lyt I-2+3 + precursor but its principal function is acting as the second signal in the induction of the cytotoxic response.\n\nIn an analagous fashion to the generation of T-cell help the cytotoxic T-cell must recognise the viral antigen and an MHC product, in this case it recognises K and D MHC structures. Once the cytotoxic lymphocyte has interacted with antigen it expresses a receptor for IL2 and becomes sensitive to IL2 released from the helper cell. Interleukin 2 appears to be necessary for activation of the cytotoxic T-cell and as its former name of \"T-cell growth factor\" suggests it is important in expanding this cytotoxic pool.\n\nThe (Zinkernagel and Rosenthal, 1981) . In the light of these observations it is not surprising to find that cytotoxic T-cells often show cross reactivity between serologically defined virus subgroups. In some instances this may be because type specific reactions in the cytotoxic assay are obscured by group specific cytotoxic events.\n\nAn apparent example of this phenomenon is the cross reactivity of murine cytotoxic T-cells for target cells infected with different strains of influenza viruses.\n\nOriginally it was thought that this was due to recognition by the T-cells of membrane-bound, group-specific, matrix protein.\n\nHowever quantitation of the amount of matrix protein on cell membranes makes this an unlikely explanation (Hackettt et al., 1980) indicating that the T-cells may express a broad specificity for the antigenically variable haemagglutinin molecule of influenza virus.\n\nOne of the most significant achievements of medicine in the last century has been the control of major virus diseases by vaccination. Since the work of Jenner and Pasteur progress has often been achieved through inspired empericism with little reference to \"theoretical immunology\".\n\nNevertheless, there has always remained a core of important diseases that have not been amenable to vaccination. Control of these diseases will undoubtedly require new insights into the protective immune response. Essex, M., Klein, G. and Snyder, P. et al, (1971) .
