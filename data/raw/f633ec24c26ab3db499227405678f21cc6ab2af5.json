The isolated yield is 56%. 1 (5-Fluoro-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-1(2H)-pyrimidinyl)acetic acid (2) . The isolated yield is 51%. General procedure for the synthesis of compounds 11-15: Compound 6-10 (500 mg) was dissolved in THF (10 mL) and stirred in an ice bath. Aqueous LiOH (1 M, 1 mL) was added dropwise and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 0.5 h. Additional aqueous LiOH was added if the TLC analysis showed the presence of the unreacted ester. Upon completion of the reaction, THF was evaporated using a rotary evaporator. The reaction mixture was then acidified by aqueous HCl (1 M) in an ice bath until the pH reaches 2-3. The obtained precipitate was filtered by a Bu\u0308chner funnel, washed with cold water and stored under vacuum in a desiccator. In the case where no precipitate was formed during acidification, the reaction mixture was extracted by 5% MeOH in DCM. The removal of organic solvents under reduced pressure yielded the respective product as a foamy solid.\n\n(11). The isolated yield is 79%. This compound exists as two rotamers. The chemical shifts for the minor rotamer are given in brackets. 1 "}
