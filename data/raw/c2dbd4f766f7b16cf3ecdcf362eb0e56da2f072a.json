{"title": "Travel medicine research in the new millennium: A bibliometric analysis of articles published in Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease", "body": "Evidence-based travel medicine requires that research priorities reflect the wide and expanding knowledge base of this evolving discipline. Bibliometric analysis is an established research tool which provides a quantitative analysis of the academic literature. Bibliometric analyses at the level of a specific topic such as emerging travel-related viral illnesses provide valuable insights into publication trends and areas of unmet research need [1, 2] . Specialty and journal-level bibliometric analyses have also been published in tropical medicine [3] and travel medicine [4] . Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease (TMAID) is a leading travel medicine journal which has been in existence since 2003. It has multiple affiliations with respected bodies such as the Faculty of Travel Medicine at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, in Glasgow, Scotland. We performed a bibliometric analysis between June 2018 and January 2019, which aimed to relate the research output of TMAID to a recognised international framework in order to identify research trends by mapping articles against the syllabus domains and sub-domains, thus informing the setting of research priorities in this growing area of clinical activity.\n\nAll indexed articles, including original research articles, brief communications, correspondence articles, editorials, reviews, case reports, diagnostic challenges and commentary papers, published in TMAID between January 2003 and January 2019, were screened from their titles and abstracts and mapped against the ISTM Body of Knowledge syllabus [5] , which comprises 7 domains and 178 sub-domains. The full text versions of articles were examined more closely when their domain was not apparent from their title. Where an individual article reflected more than one sub-domain, it was categorised into each one. A temporal analysis of publication output was also undertaken to monitor for trends in research productivity over time. The two authors (GTF and KEO) followed an identical search protocol independently and reached a consensus on final designations for each article retrieved. Data were entered in a Microsoft Excel 2013 database and summarised as totals and percentages.\n\nCategorical mapping of 1118 eligible articles (Table 1) belonging to ten article categories yielded the following number of articles for each domain: epidemiology (6.25%, n = 86); immunology/vaccinology (6.54%, n = 90); pre-travel assessment/consultation (31.32%, A mapping exercise performed at the level of the ISTM sub-domains found that three articles relating to global health and travel medicine research were uncategorisable against the current ISTM Body of Knowledge. There was a longitudinal trend over time towards higher research output in the pre-travel assessment, diseases contracted during travel and post-travel patient assessment domains. The Body of Knowledge sub-domain topics most frequently reflected in the analysed articles related to malaria (83 articles), chemoprophylaxis (62 articles), mass gatherings (57 articles), antimicrobial resistance (37 articles), immigrants (36 articles), and dengue (32 articles). The most frequently recorded travel vaccine topics discussed rabies (13 articles) and yellow fever (10 articles) vaccines.\n\nThis bibliometric analysis of travel medicine research publications in a leading journal in this field provides additional insight into global research activity in travel medicine. In comparison with a previous bibliometric analysis of a travel medicine journal [4] , TMAID has published a higher proportion of articles in the pre-travel and posttravel assessment domains. Sub-domain analysis provided further insights. We recommend that travel medicine journal-specific bibliometric analyses be repeated at regular intervals to enable trends to be identified and to inform both editorial policy and researcher priorities in this dynamic specialism.\n\nNone received.\n\nNone declared. Where the total number of articles listed by topic does not equate to the total number of articles in the Body of Knowledge sub-domain to which they belong, it may be assumed that some articles are assigned to more than one category. Similarly, articles may be classified into more than one domain. The 33 topics for which no article was published are excluded from Table 1. "}
