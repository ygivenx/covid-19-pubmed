{"title": "A prospect on the use of antiviral drugs to control local outbreaks of COVID-19", "body": "the model to represent the viral load decrease thereof. 23 In this manuscript we first present the effect of isolation, considering both home quarantine (for 24 individuals that are part of a contact trace network and for infected individuals with mild symptoms) 25 and hospital isolation (for severe cases). We argue that when an individual is quarantined at home, 26 this will only result in a partial reduction of contacts, accounting for contacts with household 27 members and other isolation imperfectness. To compensate for this imperfect isolation, we consider 28 the use of an antiviral compound. We test these different control measures in a simulation study 29 that aims at representing, given the available information, the current COVID-19 epidemic. While 30 at this phase of the epidemic, many countries are already beyond the point of local containment. We 31 do however expect that the methodology we propose will be key to avoid a second peak, especially 32 given the limited depletion of susceptibles. Individuals are initially susceptible (S) and once infected, they enter the exposed class (E). The on the notion of infectious contact processes. 5 First, contacts between individuals are generated.\n\nWhen such contacts are generated between susceptible and infectious people, these can result in 45 an infection event according to a Bernoulli probability value based on the time since infection.\n\nThis probability is computed, at a precise time point, as the product of two components: the 47 infectiousness measure, \u03bd(t), which quantifies the level of infectiousness over time, and the total 48 amount of infectivity q, i.e. the number of infections over the contact rate. 6 The function \u03bd(t) is 49 defined over the exposed and infectious period, or analogously over the incubation and symptomatic 50 period, along which it integrates to one. This function is scaled to have a similar shape among 51 different infectives, based on their lengths of exposed and infectious period. According to this 52 framework, an infectious individual makes effective contacts at a rate, r(t) given by:\n\nwhere \u03bb is the contact rate. The mean number of effective contacts is an approximation of the 54 reproduction number. The two quantities are identical in an infinite and homogeneous population, 55 where the probability of making two effective contacts with the same person is zero. For the 56 considered population size, the probability of this event is extremely low. Therefore, throughout 57 the manuscript, we approximate the reproduction number with the mean number of secondary 58 cases.\n\nIn the considered framework, isolation/quarantine is implemented by reducing the contact rate \u03bb at 60 the time of diagnosis. To date, little is known about the difference in viral load among severe and 61 mild cases. Zhou et al. 7 indicate that in nasal and throat swabs the viral load is higher in mild cases.\n\nDue to this uncertainty, we assume that the same curve is defined for all the infected individuals.\n\nIn this work, we assume the population to be homogeneous, closed and finite population. These 64 assumptions relate to the control measures currently in place, e.g. in Italy, aiming at containing 65 immigration and emigration in a country with an ongoing outbreak. 66 \n\nIn Table 1 we report the parameters and distributions that were utilized in the simulation study.\n\nWhere distributions are not reported, the parameters are assumed to be constant. In the last 68 column, when available, we report the references to the literature that justifies the choice of the 69 parameter value, or distribution, we use. 70 We assume infectious individuals to make, on average, between two and three effective contacts. nasal and throat swabs data. 7 The time to hospitalization is estimated from the data presented in 78 Backer et al. 10 We assume that the time to hospitalization coincides with the time of diagnosis. At with SARS-CoV-2, a contact tracing procedure is started. We assume that each contact in H i will 85 be traced back successfully with probability \u03b7. Depending on the considered scenario, traced-back 86 individuals will be monitored or tested. When individuals are found positive for SARS-CoV-2, they 87 will be put in quarantine/isolation. For certain scenarios, next to quarantine, we also inject infected 88 individuals with an antiviral drug (i.e., Remdesivir). 89 We assume that the test can detect infection after two days since infection. Traced individuals who 90 test negative the first time, are tested again after two days. The quarantine will result in a decreased 91 contact rate (i.e. imperfect isolation), \u03bb q , while in case of perfect isolation the contact rate is set 92 to zero. Similarly, diagnosed individuals will also be quarantined: at home (mild symptoms), with 93 a decreased contact rate \u03bb q , or in the hospital (severe symptoms), where we assume that perfect \n\nTo compensate for imperfect isolation we investigate the use of antiviral compounds to reduce the 98 infectiousness of an infected individual. We assume that, once the antiviral compound has been 99 administered, the infectiousness measure will exponentially decay according to an inverse Malthusian 100 growth model (shown in Figure 2 ). 17 The rate of this decay is set to represent the reduction in viral 101 load, due to Remdesevir, as reported in 4 for the MERS coronavirus. 102 4 All rights reserved.

Moreover, we assume that contact tracing starts at the time of diagnosis.\n\nIAS: Traced individuals are monitored for two weeks, and isolated/quarantined if they show symptoms during this period. This scenario is similar to the baseline scenario described by Hellewell et al. 1 with the exception that in our description only severe cases are isolated while the mild are home quarantined. This scenario reflects more realistically the current practice of containment.\n\nIBS: Traced individuals are isolated/quarantined, as soon as they test positive for SARS-COV-2.\n\nWe assume that an individual that is infected tests positive 2 days after infection. Therefore, a traced individual is tested immediately when traced, and, if this test was negative, we test the individual again two days later.\n\nIBTBS: A diagnosed patient is immediately treated with the antiviral drug. Furthermore, traced individuals are isolated/quarantined and injected with the antiviral drug, as soon as they test positive for SARS-COV-2. We assume that an individual that is infected tests positive 2 days after infection. Therefore, a traced individual is tested immediately when traced, and, if this test was negative, we test the individual again two days later.\n\nFor each scenario we run 5000 simulations.

This is motivated by the fact that we consider an emerging 120 outbreak and the required number of doses will thus be limited.\n\nFurthermore, we assume that all the individuals will show symptoms, sooner or later, during their 122 infectious period, and therefore all infected individuals will be diagnosed.

Although we consider a setting where the reproductive number between symptomatic and asymptomatic is 180 equal ( Figure 9 ) and a setting where the asymptomatic infectees have a reproduction number that is 181 55% of the reproduction number set for symptomatic infectees (Figure 10 ). 20 For both settings, we 182 show a significant advantage with respect to the reduction of the final size and the peak incidence.\n\nYet, our analysis also shows that when the asymptomatic are as infectious as the symptomatic 184 infectees, it is important to have a high contact tracing success rate (\u03b7). 185 We remain hopeful that the ongoing clinical trials will reveal an antiviral compound that can be \n\nWe report in Figure 4 and 5 the sensitivity analysis for the quarantine contact rate: \u03bb q = 0.1\u03bb, 0.5\u03bb.\n\nThe introduction of an antiviral compound substantially contributes in reducing the final size, the 212 peak incidence and the probability of a challenging outbreak in all the considered settings. This 213 decrease, compared to the scenario in which only isolation/quarantine is implemented, increases 214 when quarantine is less effective (left panels). In Figure 6 and 7, we vary the reproduction number 215 that is set, respectively, to R 0 = 2 and R 0 = 3.
