{"title": "Chapter 3 Adenoviruses of Vertebrate Animals", "body": "This chapter has been written to be complementary to the review of Taylor (1977) . Information is given only where it has been derived from study with animal adenoviruses, particularly with respect to the basic properties of adenoviruses.\n\nThe first adenovirus isolated was the virus of infectious canine hepatitis (ICH) (Rubarth, 1947) , although Cowdrey and Scott (1930) predicted that the intranuclear inclusions they saw in the hepatic and epithelial cells of two dogs with ICH would eventually be found to be due to a filterable agent. Green and Stillinger (1934) noted similar inclusions when they experimentally infected dogs with material from fox encephalitis. The first avian adenovirus was isolated when material from bovine lumpy skin disease was inoculated into latently infected embryonated eggs and a virus was isolated (Van den Ende et al., 1949) .\n\nHuman adenoviruses were isolated during investigations into respiratory disease (Rowe et al. 1953) ; (Hilleman and Werner, 1954) . Huebner et al. (1954) rec ognized that these agents constituted a new virus group, and Rowe et al. (1955) suggested the name \"adenoidal-pharyngeal-conjunctival (APC) viruses.\" How ever, the name \"adenoviruses\" was subsequently accepted as the generic name (Enders et al., 1956) .\n\nThe general properties required for classifying an isolate as an adenovirus were established by an international committee (Pereira et al., 1963) . The Inter national Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses recognized the genus Adenovirus (Wildy, 1971) , and a second report suggested the establishment of the family Adenoviridae with two genera, Mast adenovirus and Aviadenovirus, with human adenovirus type 2 and Celo virus as the type species (Norrby et al., 1976) .\n\nThe adenovirus virion is considered to be an icosahedral structure 70-90 nm in diameter, composed of 252 capsomers. There are 240 nonvertex capsomers (hexons) of diameter 8-9.5 nm and 12 vertex capsomers (penton base) of diame ter 7-9 nm. The vertex capsomers carry projections called \"fibers\" (Norrby et al., 1976) . The virion has no envelope but does possess a core of 60-65 nm (Home et al., 1959) .\n\nAll the accepted animal adenovirus species have been shown to possess at least most of these properties. Most isolates made at Stormont have fallen into the size range 74-80 nm (McFerran, unpublished observations) . One exception has been the hemagglutinating virus (127) isolated from a depressed egg production syn-drome. Although it has most of the properties of adenoviruses including size, the typical adenovirus structure of 20 triangular faces and 12 vertices is not resolved (Fig. 1) .\n\nThere are few records of fiber lengths for animal adenoviruses. The fibers of the canine adenovirus, which causes infectious canine hepatitis (CI), are 25-27 nm long, while a second canine adenovirus associated with respiratory disease (A26/61) has fibers of 35-37 nm (Marusyk et al., 1970) . The mouse 1 (AL) strain has a fiber length of 29 nm (Wigand et al., 1977) . Laver et al. (1971) reported two fibers on FI (Celo), one of which was 42.5 nm and the other 8.5 nm. However, Norrby (1971) found that the fiber length of Fl was 14 nm, and El Mishad et al. (1975) demonstrated fibers of 17.5 nm on Fl particles. An F8 isolate has fibers approximately 27 nm long, an untyped isolate has fibers about 14 nm long, and the structures associated with a turkey adenovirus are 27-30 nm in length (Fig. 1) . A hemagglutinating virus (127) has fibers 25-30 nm in length (ToddandMcNulty, 1978) .\n\nThe estimated molecular weight of the human and avian adenovirus virion is 173 x 10 6 (Schlesinger, 1969; Laver et al., 1971) . Although it is generally accepted that mature mammalian virion has a density of 1.33-1.34 gm/cm 3 and the avian virion that of 1.35 gm/ml in CsCl (Norrby et al., 1976) , there is little evidence that there are differences between mammalian and avaian viruses. Values for bovine adenoviruses are 1.25 gm/ml in sucrose density gradients for B5 and 1.34 gm/ml in CsCl for complete B3 virus (Niiyama et al, 1975) . Density values in CsCl of 1.29 (Konishi et al, 1977) , 1.31 (Ardans et al., 1973) , and 1.33 (Harden, 1974) to 1.34 (Dutta, 1975) have been recorded for the equine adenovirus. The dog adenovirus (Cl) has a density of 1.35 gm/ml in CsCl (Carmichael, 1964) , and a murine adenovirus has a density of 1.34 gm/ml (Wigand er al., 1977) . Densities between 1.32 and 1.37 gm/ml in CsCl have been estimated for fowl isolates (Laver et al., 1971; Potter et al., 1971; Yasue and Ishibashi, 1977; Todd and McNulty, 1978) . A value of 1.32 gm/ml was obtained for a hemagglutinating adenovirus, 127, probably of duck origin (Todd and McNulty, 1978) , and values of 1.32-1.34 gm/ml for the turkey hemorrhagic enteritis/marble spleen disease viruses (Carlson et al., 1974; Iltis et al., 1975) . Differences in the buoyant densities of human adenoviruses have been demonstrated, and these have been attributed to differences in DNA content and base composition (Green and Pina, 1964) .\n\nThe virions consist of 11.3 to 13.5% DNA, with the remainder protein (Schlesinger, 1969) . However, one report suggests that one avian virus (Fl) has 17.3% DNA ( L a v e r \u00e0 / . , 1971).\n\nBetween 10 and 13 polypeptides have been described for human adenoviruses (MaizeUfa/., 1968; Anderson et al., 1973; Evenite al., 1973) , and at least 10 polypeptides have been resolved for B3 (Niiyama et al., 1975) . A study of six human, a simian, a canine, and an equine adenovirus demonstrated that there are major differences between the polypeptides of adenoviruses isolated from pri-mates and nonprimates. However, there are also significant differences between the human strains at the molecular level (Marusyk and Cummings, 1978) .\n\nWhile one study of a fowl adenovirus (Fl) demonstrated 5-6 polypeptides (Laver et al., 1971) , other workers resolved 11-14 polypeptides in Fl (Yasue and Ishibashi, 1977) . Another avian adenovirus, 127, has 13 polypeptides, and 7 of these have counterparts in the 13 resolved polypeptides of Fl (Todd and McNulty, 1978) .\n\nThe DNA of FI has been calculated at 30 X 10 6 daltons, compared to 23 -10 6 daltons for a human adenovirus (Green et al., 1967; Laver\u00e0 al., 1971; Robinson et al., 1973) . The DNA of the B3 virion is a linear duplex, with a buoyant density in CsCl of 1.72 gm/ml (Niiyama et al., 1975) . Panigraphy et al. (1977) recorded buoyant densities of Bl to B3 as ranging from 1.71 to 1.72. There appears to be an identical structure for the DNA of FI and mammalian adeno viruses. Thus the DNA was isolated as a circular DNA protein complex and visualized as a linear molecule with the ends joined by a protein (Robinson et al., 1973) . There was about 25% homology between the DNAs of B3 and H5 by filter hybridization (Niiyama et al., 1975) . Burnett et al. (1972) divided simian adenoviruses into three groups on the basis of DNA homology and into two groups on the basis of base composition. The DNA of a mouse adenovirus has been described as a linear duplex of molecular weight 20 x 10 6 . There was less than 10% nucleotide sequence homology between the mouse and human adenoviruses (Larsen and Nathans, 1977) .\n\nIt has been possible to establish a correlation between the base composition, the guanine x cytosine (G-C), of the DNA, and the ability of human adenovirus serotypes to produce tumors in newborn hamsters (Pina and Green, 1965; Green, 1970) . Thus highly oncogenic human adenoviruses (HI2, HI8, H31) have a G-C content of 48-49%, weakly oncogenic strains (e.g., H3, H7) 50-52%, and nononcogenic strains (e.g., H8, H9, H10) 57-61%. However, this pattern does not apply to the simian adenoviruses, in which oncogenic viruses have a G-C content of 55.1-61.6% (Table V) . Thus the highly oncogenic strains SA7 and SV20 (Hull et al., 1965) have a G-C content of 58-62% (Pina and Green, 1968; Burnett et al., 1972) . The highly oncogenic B3 (Darbyshire, 1966 ) from cattle has been described as having a G-C content of 58% (Niiyama et al., 1975) and would therefore resemble the oncogenic simian viruses. However, Panigrahy et al. (1977) established the G-C content of B3 at 48% and that of the non oncogenic Bl and B2 at 61-62%, which would fit into the classification of human adenoviruses. agglutinated cells from seven mammalian species, and bovine cells were used in a hemagglutination (HI) test for Bl, B2, and B7 ). There appears to be no information on B8 and B9.\n\nc. Ovine Adenoviruses. Of the seven potential ovine serotypes and one caprine serotype examined, only 01, which agglutinated some batches of rat cells poorly (McFerran et al., 1969) , and 07, which agglutinated fowl erythrocytes (Davies and Humphreys, 1977b) , were found to have activity.\n\nd. Porcine Adenoviruses. Of the five proposed pig adenovirus species, P5 does not appear to have been tested for hemagglutinin, and P2 and P3 did not agglutinate cells from a number of species (Clarke et al., 1967) . Kasza (1966) described the agglutination of rat and fowl erythrocytes by P4, and PI aggluti nated guinea pig, human, rat, monkey, and mouse cells (Haig et al., 1964) . However, as PI was subsequently shown to be contaminated by a hemagglutinat ing pig parvovirus (Derbyshire et al., 1975) , its agglutinating activity has still to be determined. Of four unclassified Danish strains, three did not agglutinate the cells tested, while the remaining one agglutinated fowl and guinea pig erythro cytes (Rasmussan, 1969) . A French strain was tested against a very wide range of erythrocytes and agglutinated, to very low titers, only patas and vervet mon key cells (Chappuis and Tektoff, 1975) .\n\ne. Equine Adenoviruses. Although only one equine serotype is recognized, considerable differences have been recorded in the activity of strains of this virus. Thus some workers found that horse erythrocytes agglutinated Wilks and Studdard, 1973; Harden, 1974; Konishi^\u03b1/., 1977) , while others did not (Petzoldt and Schmidt, 1971; Dutta, 1975) . England et al. (1973) observed hemagglutination of mouse cells, whereas others did not (Dutta, 1975; Konishi et al., 1977) . Rat erythrocytes are agglutinated to varying degrees (Todd, 1969; England et al., 973; Harden, 1974; Konishi et al., 1977; Moorthy and Spradbrow, 1978) . Human erythrocytes also appear to have different sensi tivities in different laboratories (Todd, 1969; England et al., 1973; Dutta, 1975; Konishi et al., 1977) .\n\nf. Canine Adenoviruses. ICH was reported by Fastier (1957) to agglutinate fowl but not human or rat erythrocytes, whereas Italian workers reported positive results with erythrocytes from a large number of species (Mantovani and Gramenzi, 1956) . Epsmark and Salenstedt (1961) , on the other hand, obtained agglutination only with human and rat cells and not with fowl. These findings are now gener ally accepted. Infectious canine laryngotracheitis (ICL) virus hemagglutinates human and rat cells to similar titers (Marusyk and Yamamoto, 1971) .\n\nThe canine adenoviruses differ from the majority of human serotypes in that 80% of the hemagglutinating activity is associated with the intact or \"empty\" virus particles and the remainder with the soluble penton dimer structure (Marusyk and Yamamoto, 1971) . These workers showed that fluorocarbon and ultrasonication quickly inactivated the hemagglutinating activity. This contrasts to many of the human adenoviruses, with which fluorocarbon can be used for virus purifica tion (Green and Pina, 1963) , although H19 and H26 are inactivated by fluorocar bon (Wigand et al., 1966) . The ICH hemagglutinin-erythrocyte receptor complex appears to be more stable than human strains, since it is not dissociated either by lowering of the temperature or by the use of receptor-destroying enzyme (Simon, 1962; Norrby\u00e9>itf/., 1967; Marusyk and Yamamoto, 1971) .\n\ng. Simian Adenoviruses. It is possible to group monkey adenoviruses in a similar fashion to human adenoviruses on the basis of their power to agglutinate erythrocytes from three species (Table V) . The main differences are that most strains of monkey adenoviruses agglutinate guinea pig and rhesus erythrocytes at 4\u00b0C but not at 37\u00b0C, (Rapoza, 1967) . This can be contrasted to the human strains, of which only H8, H9, H10, and H19 hemagglutinate guinea pig cells, and with which rat and rhesus monkey cells are agglutinated at 37'C (Hierholzer, 1973) . S4 will also agglutinate human, bovine, and ovine erythrocytes (Tyrrell et al., 1960) . Hillis and Goodman (1969) divided the adenoviruses isolated from chimpan zees into three subgroups. Subgroup 1 agglutinated rhesus or vervet monkey erythrocytes; subgroup 2 hemagglutinated rat cells in the presence of heterotypic immune serum; and subgroup 3 did not agglutinate monkey, rat, guinea pig, or human cells. The subgroup 1 viruses include the Cl isolate. These isolates may have some relationship to human 16, but full cross His were not undertaken. The Cl isolate has been shown to be related by serum neutralization to H14 (Rowe et al., 1956) . The subgroup 2 viruses were divided into four strains: Y25, Y141, those viruses apparently identical to H5, and those, including C2, related to H2. Subgroup 3 had two unrelated strains, Y34 and Y37 (Hillis and Goodman, 1969) . Four serologically distinct viruses, PAN5, 6, 7, and 9, were isolated from lymph nodes of chimpanzees.PAN6 hemagglutinated rhesus monkey cells, and they were not related to human or other simian viruses (Basnight et al., 1971) .\n\nh. Murine Adenoviruses. No complete or partial hemagglutination has been recorded (Hartley and Rowe, 1960; Missal, 1969; Wigand^al., 1977) .\n\ni. Avian Adenoviruses. Fl has been shown to hemagglutinate rat cells (Clemmer, 1964; Burke et al., 1968) . Anderson et al. (1971) demonstrated that peaks of hemagglutinating activity were recorded at densities of 1.32 and 1.34 gm/ml in association with bands of complete and incomplete particles. El Mishad et al. (1975) demonstrated that while rat erythrocytes were agglutinated at 4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, maximum titers were achieved between pH 6 and pH 9, with tempera tures between 20\u00b0C and 45\u00b0C. The hemagglutinin was stable to trypsin, RNase, DNase, and neuraminidase. It was, however, inactivated after 15 minutes at 56\u00b0C, and 0.2% formaldehyde reduced its titer by eightfold. By agglutinating rat cells, the virus resembled the viruses of Rosen's human adenovirus group 2, but the fiber length of 17 nm would classify it in the human subgroup 3.\n\nWhile strains of Fl, including Phelps, EV89, and GAL3, did not agglutinate sheep cells (Clemmer, 1964; Burke et al., 1968) , Fl (Indiana C) did (Fadly and Winterfield, 1975) . Fl did not hemagglutinate a wide range of cells, including rhesus monkey erythrocytes (Kraus, 1965; El Mishad et al., 1975) .\n\nThere has been little work reported for other avian serotypes, except the failure of eight Japanese serotypes to agglutinate fowl erythrocytes . The turkey isolate (TA-1) failed to agglutinate a variety of cells (Scott and McFerran, 1972 ).\n\nAn adenovirus, 127, probably of duck origin, agglutinates fowl, duck, and turkey but not mammalian erythrocytes to high titers (McFerran et al., 1978a; Adair et al., 1979c) . The soluble hemagglutinin banded at a density of 1.24 gm/ml in CsCl gradients and had one major and one minor polypeptide. These corresponded to virus polypeptides P2 and P3, respectively, and the molecular weights of these polypeptides (67,000 and 65,000) are in the range given for the fiber and penton base of human adenovirus (Wadell and Norrby, 1969) . The purified soluble hemagglutinin was not inactivated by 30 minutes at 70\u00b0C or by 24 hours at 56\u00b0C but was totally destroyed by 30 minutes at 80\u00b0C. It was inactivated by trypsin, urea, and pyridine (Todd and McNulty, 1978) .\n\nThe mammalian adenoviruses have a soluble group antigen (Enders et al., 1956) . Thus hexon preparations of six human, three simian, and two canine adenoviruses showed cross reactivity in the complement fixation (CF) test . Exceptions to this have been the subgroup 2 bovine adenoviruses Table II ). While the subgroup 1 viruses fully share a common antigen with human adenoviruses, the subgroup 2 viruses have only a weak relationship. The reaction is stronger when human antigen is reacted against bovine subtype 2 sera than with the reverse reaction (Bartha, 1969) . Support for these findings has come from other workers (Tanaka^/ al., 1968; Mohanty, 1971; Rondhuis, 1973; Mattson et al., 1977) . However, Inaba et al. (1968) showed that there was as much sharing of antigens between human strains and B4 and B7 as there was between B4 and B7. B6 shared a common CF antigen with B1-B4 and P4 adenoviruses (Mayr et al., 1970) . B4 had a common line of identity with H2 in the immunodiffusion test (Cole, 1970) , and a B5 isolate had the adenovirus group antigen (Coda et al., 1975) . Baczynski et al. (1974) used purified hexon antigens of B5 and B8 in the CF and fluorescent antibody CF tests against antisera to B4, 3, and 4 -8 and demonstrated that both subgroups shared an antigen, but titers were two-to fourfold higher with the homologous system.\n\nAlthough the ovine (McFerran et al., 1971b; Sharp et al., 1974; Bauer et al., 1975) , caprine (Gibbs et al., 1977) , porcine (Clarke et al., 1967) , and equine (Todd, 1969) strains have been reported to share the common group antigen, this is usually based on a nonquantitative immunodiffusion test. There were indica-tions that not all ovine adenoviruses shared the group antigen to the same degree (McFerran et al., 1971b) . The canine adenoviruses have a one-way cross with human adenoviruses. Thus Cl antigen will detect CF antibody in human serum as efficiently as human adenovirus antigen, but human adenovirus antigens do not detect antibody in dog sera (Kapsenberg, 1959; Heller and Salenstedt, 1960; Carmichael and Barnes, 1961) . The horse and canine adenoviruses have a cross relationship (Konishi et al., 1977) . The murine strains share a group antigen with human adenoviruses, but this is basically a one-way cross, with only antiserum to human adenovirus reacting with the mouse adenovirus (Hasimoto et al., 1966; Wigm\u00e0etal., 1977) .\n\nThe avian adenoviruses have a common group antigen, but this antigen is distinct from the mammalian group antigen McFerran et al., 1975) . The viruses of turkey hemorrhagic enteritis and pheasant marble spleen disease share a common antigen (Domermuth and Gross, 1975; Domermuth et al., 1975; Iltis et al., 1975) . Opinions are divided as to whether they share an antigen with other avian viruses (Iltis et al., 1977) or do not Silim et al., 1978) . The hemagglutinating adenovirus (127) asso ciated with depressed egg production partially shares an antigen with other fowl adenoviruses (McFerran et al., 1978b) .\n\nIt is generally recognized that the adenoviruses are resistant to lipid solvents and are rapidly inactivated by 56\u00b0C (Norrby et al., 1976) . They are acid stable (Andrewes et al., 1978) , and their heat stability is reduced by divalent ions (Wallis et al., 1962) . While the animal adenoviruses have all been shown to be resistant to lipid solvents, there are differences in response to the other agents.\n\nThe equine adenoviruses vary in their stability to pH 3. Some workers have found them stable (Ardans et al., 1973; Dutta, 1975) , while others have found that pH 3 caused either complete inactivation or a marked fall in titer (Harden, 1974; Moorthy and Spradbrow, 1978) . Harden (1974) found that pH 5 caused a 99% reduction in titer. The bovine and ovine strains tested were resistant to pH 3. Variation on pH sensitivity has been found in the same laboratory between two porcine strains (Chappuis and Tektoff, 1975) .\n\nThe activity of equine adenoviruses was not removed by 30 minutes at 56\u00b0C, although the titer was reduced Harden, 1974) . When divalent cations at 50\u00b0C were examined, one strain was unaffected (Dutta, 1975) and another destabilized (Harden, 1974) . The bovine adenoviruses show consid-\u00e9rable variation in their response to heat, and this property is discussed under their classification. The ovine adenoviruses resist 56\u00b0C, and divalent ions in crease their inactivation (McFerran et al., 1971b; Bauer et al., 1975) . The ICL (A26/61) canine adenovirus is inactivated by 40 minutes at 56\u00b0C (Yamamoto, 1966) . The fowl adenoviruses are apparently the most variable. At 56\u00b0C, FI (U. Conn) was inactivated after 90 minutes (Petek et al., 1963) , while FI (Phelps) was still viable (Yates and Fry, 1957) . FI (EV-89) was still infective after 22 hours (Burke et al., 1959) . The infectivity of Fl (93) was reduced by 30 minutes at 70\u00b0C but not removed until 80\u00b0C was reached (Clemmer, 1964) , and F2 (65) was not completely inactivated by 40 minutes at 60\u00b0C (Cho, 1971) . Strains tested in the same laboratory have shown variations in thermostability, suggesting that these variations cannot be ascribed just to differences in technique (Rosenberger et al., 1974; Mustaffa-Babjee and Spradbrow, 1975) . Fowl adenoviruses have been found to be destabilized by divalent cations (Petek et al., 1963; Burke et al., 1965; McFerran et al., 1972) , although other workers could not confirm this . Some other variations could be due to technique, however. Thus 3-30 minutes at 56\u00b0C inactivated both mouse adenovirus types, and divalent ions had no effect (Hartley and Rowe, 1960; Hasimoto et al., 1966; Missal, 1969) . But Wigand et al. (1977) found that if cell culture supernatant was used, 30 minutes at 56\u00b0C inactivated the virus, whereas if the supernatant was diluted 1:20 in distilled water, the virus was thermostable. Yamamoto (1967) drew attention to the importance of pH when testing for the effects of cations on thermal stability.\n\nThe human adenoviruses have been divided into two subgroups on the basis of their growth in cell culture (Boyer et al., 1957 (Boyer et al., , 1959 . This not only aids in classification but also appears to extend to other properties. The members of subgroup A of human adenoviruses tend to cause sporadic outbreaks of disease and exist in occult form in the tonsils, while the members of subgroup B tend to cause epidemics and do not normally persist in the tonsils (Parker et al., 1961) . In addition, there appears to be a correlation between cytopathology subgroup and virus multiplication cycle (Ginsberg, 1958) , neutralization reaction (Denny and Ginsberg, 1964) , G-C content (Philipson and Pettersson, 1973) , and hemagglutinating characteristics (Rosen, 1960) . It has been possible to classify the animal adenoviruses studied into these human adenovirus subgroups (see Table I ).\n\nElectron microscopic studies on the development of human adenoviruses in cell cultures have been described (Martinez-Palomo et al., 1967; Weber and Stich, 1969) . Viral multiplication occurred in the nucleus of infected cells. Virus particles, some with electron-dense and some with electron-lucent cores, accu- a Based on the classification suggested for human adenoviruses of Boyer^f al. (1957 ( , b Boyer et al.

Four types of inclusion, differing in density and morphology, were shown to be composed of viral proteins, some in association with viral DNA. Large protein paracrystals with a well-defined structure were described. The morphogenesis, structure of virus particles, and virus-associated inclu sions are similar in all the animal adenoviruses (Figs. 2 and 3) studied to those described for human adenoviruses. For further information, see for bovine Curran (1978-1979) , for ovine Adair (1979b) , for porcine Chandler (1965) , for equine Shahrabadi et al. (1977) , for canine Givan and Jezequel (1969) and Yamamoto (1969) , for simian Fong et al. (1965 Fong et al. ( , 1968 , for murine Blailock et al. (1968) , and for avian adenoviruses Maeda et al. (1967) and Adair et al. (1979a) .\n\nThe cell growth of each species is considered in Section IV. In general, they grow best in cells from the homologous species, and some have a very limited range of cells in which they will grow. The turkey hemorrhagic enteritis marble spleen disease viruses are unique in that they have not so far been propagated in cell cultures, although a wide range has been tried (Carlson et al., 1974; Iltis et al., 1975; Domermuth and Gross, 1978) .\n\nBoth B3 (Darbyshire, 1966; Gilden et al., 1967; Nishibe et al., 1970) and B8 (Rondhuis, 1973) produce tumors when inoculated into newborn Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratius). No oncogenicity has been shown for Bl, B2, or B6 (Rondhuis, 1973; Panigraphy et al., 1977) . Mohanty (1971) could find no onco genicity for serotypes 1-8, omitting B3. The conflicting results in these studies may be due to the use of different strains of B8.\n\nLow doses of B3 produced a solid tumor arising from the mesenchymatous tissue. These tumors had a latent period of at least 1 month and occasionally produced m\u00e9tastases. High doses produced hemorrhagic cystic lesions with a latent period of less than 1 month (Darbyshire et al., 1968) .\n\nB3 transformed a variety of hamster cells but not rat or mouse cells in vitro (Panigrahy et al., 1976) . B3 was nononcogenic in mice, despite the use of antilymphocytic serum (Darbyshire et al., 1968; Panigrahy et al., 1976) . Rondhuis (1973) found that B8 had a low oncogenic potential for hamsters. Thus although some tumors arose within a month, most developed 5 to 15 months after inoculation. These were of the fibrosarcoma type, and about 10% showed m\u00e9tastases. \n\nSerotypes of these species do not appear to have been tested for oncogenicity.\n\nThe isolate 435 did not produce tumors after 15 months (Gibbs et al., 1977) .\n\nThe viruses ICH and ICL both produced tumors in hamsters (Sarma et al., 1967; Dulac et al., 1970) . Both ICH and ICL have low oncogenicity (Sarma et al., 1967; Kinjo et al., 1968) . Virus was not recovered from primary and transplanted tumors, but antibody to tumor antigen and to the cell culture T antigen of ICH was demonstrated in the sera of tumor-bearing hamsters (Sarma et al.y 1967; Kinjo et al., 1968) . The ICL virus produced undifferentiated sar comas following 187 to 273 days of incubation. These tumors were also transplantable, and the hamsters developed antibody to T antigen. Sera from hamsters with tumors due to virus generally had two to four times higher titers to ICL than to ICH T antigens (Dulac et al., 1970) .\n\nOncogenicity in hamsters has been established for the following monkey serotypes: SI (Huebner et al., 1962) , S5, SII, S12, S14, S15, S16 (Hull et al., 1965) , S2, S6, S7 (Gilden et al., 1968) , and S8 (Slifkin et al., 1968) . These strains have differing degrees of oncogenicity. Thus S16 produced tumors in all animals inoculated after 41 days, whereas SII produced only one tumor after 229 days. In a comparative study, Burnett et al. (1972) found S5 and S16 the most oncogenic and were unable to confirm the oncogenicity of S6 or S14. Strain S16 will also produce tumors in suckling rats (Hull et al., 1965) . Monkey adenovirus-induced tumors rarely metastasize unless virus is inoculated intraperitoneally. The tumors are usually invasive and poorly differentiated. Types S5, S8, and S16 induced tumors resembling lymphomas, while the other strains produce palisading, pseudoaciner, and spindle cell patterns (Merkow and Slifkin, 1973) .\n\nFl will produce fibrosarcomas (Sarma et al., 1965) , hepatomas (Anderson et al., 1971) , ependymonas (Mancini et al., 1969) , and adenocarcinomas (Stenback et al., 1973) . In vitro transformations of human and hamster cells have been reported (Andersons#/., 1969a,b) .\n\nAttempts to demonstrate oncogenicity with other avian serotypes have been unsuccessful (Sarma et al., 1965; Fadly \u00e9tal., 1976) .\n\nThere are four adenovirus-associated viruses (AAV) which have been asso ciated with primates. Of these two, AAV1 and AAV4, are possibly of simian origin (Rapoza and Atchinson, 1967; Parks et al., 1970) .\n\nAAV have been recognized in bovine ( Fig. 4a ) (Luchsinger et al., 1970) , ovine (Clarke et al., 1979) , equine (Dutta, 1975) , canine (Sugimura and Yanagawa, 1968 ), fowl (Dutta and Pomeroy, 1967; McFerran et al., 1971a) , and turkey (Scott and McFerran, 1972) adenovirus strains. AAV4 agglutinates human erythrocytes at 4\u00b0C (Ito and Mayor, 1968) . The bovine AAV agglutinates sheep, human, guinea pig, and mouse cells at 4\u00b0C and 22\u00b0C, and horse cells only at 4\u00b0C (Luchsinger et al., 1970) . The ovine strain agglutinates guinea pig and human erythrocytes at 4\u00b0C and guinea pig cells at 22\u00b0C (Clarke et al., 1979) . Avian adenoviruses are distinct from mammalian AAV types (Yates et al., 1973; El Mishad et al., 1975) . Although many stock cultures of fowl adenoviruses have AAV present (El Mishad et al., 1975) , this may be due to AAV infection in the parent flock supplying the eggs for cell culture. Immuno-electron microscopy examination of both field isolates and stock pools has shown relatively low levels of infection with AAV (McFerran, unpublished observations), and Yates et al. (1976) found that only 2 of 38 adenovirus isolates were infected with AAV.\n\nAAV can reduce both pathogenicity (Pronovost et al., 1978) and oncogenicity (Kirschstein et al., 1968) , as well as reducing the replication of adenoviruses in cell cultures (Hoggan et al., 1966) .\n\n/. Classification a. Groups. Nine bovine adenovirus serotypes are recognized on the basis of cross neutralization tests Guenov et al., 1971; Mohanty, 1971; Adair and McFerran, 1976) (Table II) . A tenth serotype has been proposed but not yet accepted (Kretzschmar, 1973) .\n\nb. Subgroups. Bartha (1969) suggested that the bovine adenoviruses could be divided into two groups. Subgroup 1 viruses are inactivated by 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes, replicate in bovine testicular and kidney cells, are readily isolated on first passage in cell culture, have single, irregularly shaped inclusion bodies, and share an antigen with human adenoviruses. Subgroup 2 viruses are reduced in titer but not inactivated by 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes, replicate only in bovine testes cells, form multiple regular inclusion bodies, and are difficult to adapt to cell culture. There is only a partial sharing of an antigen with human adenoviruses. Bartha and Kisary (1970) modified this classification, as they found that resistance at 56\u00b0C could be modified by passage. Thus the prototype strains of Bl and B2 were still themolabile after 10 passages but thermolabile after 60 passages. One B3 strain was reduced in titer but not inactivated by 56\u00b0C (Mattson, 1973) , while another B3 isolate was virtually inactivated (Lehmkuhl et al., 1975) . B4 and B6 strains were either inactivated or markedly reduce in titer by 30 minutes at 56\u00b0C (Tanaka et al., 1968; Cole, 1970; Coria et al., 1975) , whereas although B7 had a 99% fall in titer after 30 minutes at 56\u00b0C, 2000 TOD.\u2122 was still present after 120 minutes. Clearly, more work is required to establish if this is a reasonable parameter for classification.\n\nThe serological relationship between the proposed subgroups 1 and 2 and human adenoviruses is discussed in Section IV. It is clear that although differences Curran (1978-1979) . c Based on Bartha (1969) . d N.I., no information available.\n\ndo exist between bovine subgroups 1 and 2, they may also exist between species within these subgroups and between adenoviruses of different species. Therefore, more work is required to establish the true situation. Phillip and Sands (1972) showed that B4 and B7 had inclusions which were numerous single irregular and multiple round types corresponding to both of Bartha's subgroups. However, Curran (1978-1979) have shown that there is reasonable agreement between the pattern of growth in cell culture and Bartha's subgroups. Thus B l -3 and B9 fell into group B, and B4-6 and B8 fell into group A. B7, however, is in Bartha's subgroup 2 but falls into cytopathology group B. A number of workers have confirmed that subgroup 2 viruses do not replicate in bovine kidney (BK) cells (Bartha and Aldasy, 1966; Tanaka et al., 1968; Cole, 1970; Phillip and Sands, 1972 ). It appears that these viruses grow in the epithelial cells of bovine testes (BT) cultures but not in the epithelial cells of BK (Aldasy et al, 1965; Mattson et al., 1977; Sibalin et al., 1978) . However, other workers have found that B4 (THT), B5 (B4/65), B6 (671130), B6 (KC-2), B7 (Fukuroi), and B8 (Misk/67) all grow as well in (BK) as in (BT) cells. Other strains of species B4 (KC-6), B5 (BIL), and B6 (RG) all required one to two blind passages in bovine embryonic corneal (BEC) cells before pro ducing a cytopathic effect (CPE), and B4 (Negano) could not be adapted to BK cells (Mohanty, 1971) . Although in general the subgroup 2 viruses conform to Bartha's classification in that they are difficult to isolate in cell cultures and grow to low titers (Cole, 1970; Mohanty, 1971) , others have recorded high titers (Tanaka et al., 1968; Stauber et al., 1976) . Furthermore, the subgroup 1 viruses can also be difficult to isolate and can grow to very low titers (Klein, 1962; Darby shire et al., 1965 Darby shire et al., , 1969 Lehmkuhl^a/., 1975) .\n\nIt would appear, therefore, that the two subgroups proposed for bovine adenoviruses are, at best, only a guide to classification.\n\nBovine adeno viruses are widespread. Antibody studies have shown that be tween 25 and 87% of sera examined possess antibody to one or more types (Klein et al., 1959; Tanaka et al., 1968; Rondhuis, 1970; Phillip and Sands, 1972; Rossina/., 1973; Mattson et al., 1977) .\n\nA number of authors have shown that at least some strains are found more often in the oronasal secretions and in conjunctival swabs than in feces. Virus has not been detected in the feces in B3-infected animals (Mattson, 1973; Mattson et al., 1977) , while other isolates were made from the feces (Klein et al., 1959 (Klein et al., , 1960 . Following intratracheal inoculation of B3, there were more isolates from the nose (40) and conjunctiva (25) than from the feces (14) . Using B4, Aldasy et al. (1965) made more isolations from the feces than nasal swabs, but with a high recovery from the conjunctiva. Cole (1971) found that following intratracheal inoculation, B4 was excreted in nasal secretions and in the feces from the fifth to the eleventh day after infection. The urine may well be a source of infection (Belak et al., 1977) and thus may be an important factor in intensive-production units, where food can be contaminated with urine or urine drinking occurs.\n\nIt is evident from the large number of adenoviruses isolated from all cultures derived from fetuses that transplacental infection occurs. The existence of such carriers may be very important in the epizootiology. Mattson (1973) suggested that latent infection was reactivated in the dam at calving and showed that calves should be infected in spite of maternally derived antibody. Cole (1971) studied the distribution of B4 (BIL) and found virus in the respira tory tract and drainage lymph nodes from days 1-12 postinfection (PI), with maximum dissemination in visceral organs from days 5-7 PI, when virus was found in the liver. But as neither histological nor fluorescent antibody (FA) examination showed evidence of virus growth, the virus in the liver may be in macrophages.\n\na. Normal Animals. Many bovine adenoviruses have been isolated from apparently normal animals. Among these were prototypes 1 and 2, isolated from feces (Klein et al., 1959 (Klein et al., , 1960 , and type 3 from the conjunctiva (Darbyshire et al., 1965) . Isolations have also been made under conditions not associated with adenoviruses, such as the isolation of a type 6 virus from the lymph node of a leukotic cow (Mayr et al., 1970) . Some isolations have been made from organs taken for cell culture from normal animals. Thus the prototype 9 and a B2 virus were isolated from primary bovine kidney cells (Mohanty and Lillie, 1970; Guenov et al., 1971) ) and an untyped isolate also from kidney . The B6 prototype strain came from a calf testes cell culture (Rondhuis, 1968) , as did B4 strains (Bartha and Csontos, 1969) and B4 and B6 (Phillip and Sands, 1972) strains. Burki et al. (1978) made 14 isolations from the testicles of normal slaughterhouse calves.\n\nb. Conjunctivitis. A number of strains of adenovirus have been isolated from the conjunctiva of cattle with infectious keratoconjunctivitis in Australia (Wilcox, 1969) . Experimental infection of calves with these isolates produced a mild conjunctivitis after an incubation period of 7-14 days. Neisseria catarrhalis and Moraxelia bovis may be associated as secondary invaders (Wilcox, 1970) .\n\nc. Respiratory Disease and Enteritis. Adenoviruses have been associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract disease. In some of these outbreaks, diarrhea has been a minor or major problem. The first associations of bovine adenoviruses with respiratory tract disease came from serological (Darbyshire and Pereira, 1964; Harbourne, 1966) and histological evidence (Omar, 1966) .\n\nBl and B2 have not often been recorded from field outbreaks of disease. Saxegaard and Bratberg (1971) isolated Bl from an outbreak of anorexia, nasal discharge, and diarrhea. Attempts at experimental reproduction of disease using these serotypes have produced only mild illness (Mohanty and Lillie, 1965; Darbyshire et al., 1969) , while other workers were unable to reproduce disease (Klein et al., 1960; Ide et al., 1969) . Tury et al. (1978) claim to have produced microscopic changes in the respiratory tract, kidney, liver, intestine, and lymph nodes with a B2 type virus isolated from sheep. B3 has been isolated from an outbreak of acute respiratory tract disease in feedlot cattle (Lehmkuhl et al., 1975) and has also been associated with a disease syndrome in a beef herd over a 4-year period (Mattson, 1973) . This occurred in 1-to 4-week-old calves and was characterized by ocular and nasal discharge, tympanies, colic, and diarrhea. Experimental infections of calves with B3 have ranged from no disease (Ide et al., 1969) to clinical disease. Only mild clinical signs were seen when day-old colostrum-deprived calves were infected with B3 (WBR-1), but areas of col lapse, emphysema, and consolidation were seen in the lungs . Intratracheal inoculation of 3-month-old calves with B3 (FOS-213) pro duced hyperpnea, dyspnea, and anorexia (Lehmkuhl et al., 1975) .\n\nA number of serotypes have been associated with pneumonoenteritis in calves. These include B4 (Aldasy et al., 1965) and B8 . This condition occurs mainly in 2-week-old to 4-month-old calves. Initially, upper respiratory tract signs are seen, quickly followed by increased salivation and diarrhea. Following a 1-2-week course, most calves recover, although with a marked loss of condition; however, about 10% develop more severe respiratory signs, and many die. At autopsy the main findings depend on the stage of the disease. There is usually a hemorrhagic tracheitis, and lung changes vary from hyperemic through catarrhal pneumonia to a purulent pneumonia, often associ ated with pleurisy and endocarditis (Aldasy et al., 1965) . Experimental infection of calves with B4 reproduced the syndrome, albeit in a milder form. Mohanty (1971) carried out experimental infections with B4, B5, and B8. Calves infected with B4 and B5 had clinical respiratory signs, while those given B8 did not. Some of the calves given B4 and B5 had macroscopic and micro scopic lung changes. B4 appears to be the most important pathogenic bovine adenovirus in central Europe (Burki, 1973) .\n\nIn Australia, B4 (BIL) and B6 (RG) have been isolated from the lungs and noses or calves with pneumonia. The two BIL strains were from the lungs of calves with acute exudative pneumonia, while seven RG strains were from the lungs or noses of calves with varying degrees of penumonia or bronchitis and one RG strain was from a nasal swab of a normal calf. Following intratracheal inoculation of B4 (BIL) into calves, a mild interstitial pneumonia was induced (Cole, 1971) .\n\nA virus isolated from the blood of a cow with anorexia, pyrexia, diarrhea, and respiratory signs (Inabaet al., 1968) was designated \"prototype 7\" (Matumotoet al., 1970) . Adenoviruses have also been isolated from cases of enzootic pneu monia in calves. These include the proposed BIO virus (Kretzschmar, 1973) and untyped isolates (Lupini et al., 1970) . d. Weak Calf Syndrome. This syndrome has been described in the United States (Card et al., 1974; Cutlip and McClurkin, 1975) . Calves are usually weak and listless at birth, with a locomotor disturbance due to a polyarthritis, and often have diarrhea. At necropsy there is blood-tinged synovial fluid and subcutaneous hemorrhages in the hock, metacarpal, and metatarsal regions. Mortality is 6-15% of calves in the herd.\n\nB5 viruses have been isolated from the synovial fluid ) and a B7 type virus from the buffy coat (Stauber et al., 1976) . Experimental inocula tions of calves with the B5 (Idaho) isolate resulted in a mild self-limiting illness, with pyrexia and mild diarrhea. Following intraveneous infection, lesions devel oped which closely resembled the natural disease seen in Idaho and Montana. It has been suggested that this condition may be due to interaction of cold wet weather, bovine viral diarrhea, and adenovirus McClurkin and Coria, 1975) .\n\nMost isolations of bovine adenoviruses have been made in either calf kidney (CK) or calf testes (CT) cells. However, these cells are not necessarily the most sensitive. Thus Stauber et al. (1976) had the highest titers (10 7 ) for B7 in calf salivary gland cells, and Coria et al. (1975) found that B4 and B5 grew well in bovine turbinate cells.\n\nOne difficulty is that many bovine isolates (including subgroup A) required 20-50 days of incubation before a good CPE was observed. Part of the difficulty may be that the CPE depends on the multiplicity of infections, as even with recognized isolates, tubes near the end point may take up to 17 days to produce a discernible CPE (Coriace//., 1975; Lehmkuhlef al., 1975) . Elazhary and Derbyshire (1978) found that higher titers of B3 were obtained if they were grown in suspension cultures of MDBK cells and suggested that the virus might have a preference for young, actively dividing cells. This is of interest because a similar observation has been made for sheep adenoviruses (McFerran et al., 1971b) . It is therefore suggested that suspected specimens be passaged in freshly dispersed cells.\n\nThe observation that B3 grows in bovine trach\u00e9al organ culture is of interest (Bouffard and Derbyshire, 1978) , not only because the virus was shown to replicate only in cells of epithelial origin but also because of its potential use in diagnosis. It may well be that bovine trach\u00e9al organ culture will be most useful in isolating not only adenoviruses but also bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine coronavirus (Sioii et al., 1976) .\n\nFive ovine serotypes are recognized (Adair and McFerran, 1976) (Table III) . Two isolates (WV419 and WV757) from New Zealand (Davies and Humphreys, 1977b ) may be new serotypes, but this has not yet been confirmed. They appar ently grow best in lamb testicular cells and may be counterparts of the subgroup 2 bovine adenoviruses.\n\nAdenoviruses have been isolated from sheep in Australia (Showdon, 1971), Hungary (Belak and Palfi, 1974) , New Zealand (Davies and Humphreys, 1977b) , Turkey (Bauer et al., 1975) , and the United Kingdom (McFerran et al., 1971b; Sharp et al., 1974) . Little immunoprecipitin antibody is detectable (Darbyshire and Pereira, 1964; Timoney, 1971) , but virus-neutralizing antibody is wide spread.\n\nThese viruses have been isolated from both nasal swabs and feces. Following experimental infection, one strain was isolated from the respiratory tract for 7 days, from the intestine for 10 days, and from the kidney for up to 14 days (Davies and Humphreys, 1977a ). It appears that sheep can be infected not only with ovine adenoviruses but also with bovine strains (Belak and Palfi, 1974) .\n\nViruses have been isolated from clinically normal sheep (McFerran et ai, 1971b; Bauer et al., 1975; Davies and Humphreys, 1977b) , from sheep with diarrhea (McFerran et al., 1971b) , and from respiratory tract disease in inten sively reared lambs (Belak and Palfi, 1974; Sharper al., 1974) . Experimental infection has produced equivocal results. Inoculation of 04 into lambs did not produce clinical signs, although the virus replicated and stimulated an antibody response (Sharp et al., 1974) . A similar failure to reproduce disease was recorded for 05 (Bauer et al., 1975) . A New Zealand isolate, WV757, produced a mild illness in 3-to 4-month-old lambs (Davies and Humphreys, 1977a ).\n\nAn isolate, serologically identical to B2, produced severe respiratory and intestinal signs in colostrum-deprived lambs following an incubation period of 3 days (Belak et al., 1975) . Furthermore, in-contact lambs also became ill. The main pathological lesion was a catarrhal pneumonia.\n\nTwo adenoviruses, 1-435 and 2-480, which on the basis of the serum neutrali zation (SN) test are distinct serotypes, have been isolated from goats (Gibbs et al., 1977) .\n\nNeutralizing antibody to a caprine adenovirus (435) was found to be wide spread in goat, sheep, and cattle sera both in Nigeria and in England (Gibbs et al., 1977) . It is not known if the antibody in sheep and cattle is due to infection with 435 virus or to the broad antigenicity of 435-detecting antibody to other adenoviruses.\n\nNo information is available.\n\nThese viruses were isolated in lamb kidney cells from the intestines of goats with peste des petit ruminants in Nigeria. They are not thought to have any part in the etiology of this condition (Gibbs et al., 1977) .\n\nIt is probable that goat cells are at least as sensitive to infection as lamb cells. Isolate 435 did not produce a CPE in bovine kidney, BHK21, or Vero cells (Gibbs et al., 1977) .\n\nFour serotypes are recognized (Table IV) . The initial isolate, 25R (Haig et al., 1964) , was designated \"PI,\" and two new isolates, 6618 and A47, \"P2\" and \"P3,\" respectively (Clarke et al., 1967) ; this designation was followed by other workers (Adair and McFerran, 1976) . However, these numbers were transposed (Christofinis et al., 1972) , and their notation was followed by the WHO/FAO committee on classification (Anonymous, 1973) . Bibrack (1969) suggested that a German and an American isolate (Kasza, 1966) were identical and should be considered P4. The relationship between these strains is clear-cut (Derbyshire et al., 1975; Adair and McFerran, 1976) . Derbyshire et al. (1975) suggested that strain 100 should be considered a new serotype. They also described strains of broad antigenicity. A French isolate, not related to the four recognized serotypes, has also been described, but full cross neutralization tests were not undertaken (Chappuis and Tektoff, 1975) .\n\nPorcine adenoviruses are widely distributed. Thus 20% of sera examined from Bulgarian and Hungarian pigs had group antibody (Guenov and Bodon, 1976) , and 18% of Australian pig sera tested had type antibody to a local isolate (Kwon and Spradbrow, 1971 ). Antibody to types 1-3 was widespread in England (Clarke et al., 1967), and Bibrack (1970) demonstrated that antibody to type 4 was common in Bavarian pigs.\n\nSerotypes 1-3 and eight field isolates (including potential serotype 5) all appear to have a predilection for the alimentary tract (Derbyshire et al., 1975) . Even following intranasal or aerosol exposure, the main site of replication was the alimentary tract, although virus was also recovered from the respiratory tract (Sharpe and Jesse\u00ab, 1967; Jericho^al., 1971 ).\n\nP4 appears able to grow in a wider variety of tissues, including the nervous, respiratory, and alimentary tracts. Furthermore, it can be reisolated for up to 48 days following infection. As the virus was more widely distributed following intranasal than oral infection, it has been suggested that aerial transmission is important in* the spread of this virus (Shadduck<?f al., 1968) . Derbyshire et al. (1975) \" Based on Adair (1976) . h But the strain tested was later found contaminated with a hemagglutinating parvovirus.\n\nOne feature of pig adenoviruses has been the number of reported isolations made from cell cultures of apparently healthy pigs (K\u00f6hler and Apodaca, 1966; Mahnel and Bibrack, 1966; Rasmussen, 1969; Kwon and Spradbrow, 1971; Kawamura et al., 1972; Chappuis and Tektoff, 1975) . Bibrack (1970) isolated adenoviruses from 35% of kidneys obtained from pigs at slaughter, and Guenov et al. (1968) found that up to 10% of pig kidneys contained latent adenoviruses. These viruses grew to very low titers.\n\nIt is possible that this high incidence of latent infection with adenovirus is responsible for the contamination of hog cholera strains. Thus Bodon (1966) found that seven supposedly cytopathic strains of hog cholera virus were in fact contaminated with adenovirus.\n\nAlthough transplacental passage of pig adenovirus has not been recorded, intrauterine infection of pig fetuses resulted in widespread dissemination of virus and abortion 9 days after infection (Sharpe, 1967) .\n\na. Normal Animals. Many adenoviruses have been isolated from normal swine (Derbyshire et al., 1966; Rasmussen, 1969) , in addition to the numerous isolations made from kidney cells grown from healthy pigs.\n\nb\u00b7 Encephalitis. P4 virus was isolated from the brain of a pig with encepha litis (Kasza, 1966) , and encephalitis has been experimentally reproduced follow ing intracerebral inoculation (Shadduck et al., 1967) . Edington et al. (1972) , although producing no clinical signs, did obtain meningoencephalitis and a se vere peritubular mononuclear infiltration of the kidneys in pigs following oral or intranasal inoculation with P4. These lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) were not seen until 2 weeks after infection.\n\nc. Respiratory. Following experimental infection with P4, an interstitial pneumonia was produced in addition to lesions in the kidneys, thyroid, and lymph nodes. The cells affected were mostly members of the reticuloendothelial system (Shadduck et al., 1967) . Bibrack (1970) , in an investigation of natural cases of enzootic pneumonia, did not make many adenovirus isolations. Kasza et al. (1969) suggested a synergistic effect between P4 and Mycoplasma hypopneumoniae and drew attention to the difficulties of isolation of the virus even from experimental cases. d. Enteritis. The prototype 1 virus was isolated from a case of diarrhea (Haig et al., 1964) , and pigs with diarrhea had intranuclear inclusions in the epitheliai cells of the villi of the ileum and jejunum (Fujiwara^f al., 1968) . Some workers produced a mild diarrhea when isolates were given orally (Derbyshire et al., 1975) , while others were unsuccessful (Shadduck et al., 1967; Sharpe and Jessen, 1967) .\n\nFollowing aerosol exposure of P2 (6618), focally distributed intranuclear in clusions and subepithelial lymphoid accumulations were found in epithelial cells of the villi of the jejunum. In the lungs there was an increase of lymphoid tissue in connective tissue at all levels of the bronchial tree, and inclusion bodies were seen within these proliferations (Jericho et al., 1971 ) .\n\nPrimary pig kidney (PK) cells are probably the most sensitive, but the P4 strains required up to 42 days in cell cultures before the initial isolation (Shadduck et al., 1968; Kasza et al., 1969) . PI, P2, and P3 grew to IO 7 in PK cells (Sharp and Jessett, 1967) , whereas some of the isolates from latently infected cells reached 10 3 at maximum . There have been reports that some strains grow in MDCK and in calf, human, and patas monkey kidneys (Kasza, 1966; Chappuis and Tektoff, 1975) .\n\nBoth the SN and double immunodiffusion (DID) techniques have been used for detecting antibody. The SN test can be made more sensitive by adding the virus serum mixture to the cells in suspension and then allowing the monolayer to form (Kwon and Spradbrow, 1971 ).\n\nOnly one serotype is recognized. However, 16 horses were found in Australia with adenovirus CF antibody but without antibody to El, suggesting that other adenoviruses infect horses (Studdert et al., 1974) .\n\nAntibody surveys indicate that between 10 and 25% of horses have precipitat ing antibody (Darbyshire and Pereira, 1964; Afshar, 1969; Timoney, 1971 ). However, using the HI test, 73% of horse sera tested had antibody (Studdert et al., 191 A) . A comparative study revealed that 100% had SN antibody, 68% had CF antibody, and the immunodiffusion test indicated 19% affected (Harden et al., 1974) .\n\nThere is no direct evidence of carriers or in utero infection, but indirect evidence suggests this possibility. Thus the virus has been recovered from the nasal mucus of a 3-day-old Clydesdale foal (Wilks and Studdert, 1973) . Fur thermore, on four farms during a 4-year observation period, multiple incidences of disease occurred within groups of foals. One mare gave birth in successive years to three foals that died of pneumonia, indicating not only a genetic defi ciency but also virus persistence . There is often a very high incidence of antibody on farms (Todd, 1969; Studdert et al., 1974) . Foals before suckling had no antibody to adenovirus, which develops after ingestion of colostrum (Harden et al., 1974) . Serological studies indicate that reinfection is fre quent, and infection or reinfection can occur in the presence of high levels of circulating antibody. However, subclinical infections appear to occur quite fre quently between 90 and 150 days, when maternal antibody levels have fallen (Harden^\u00ab/., 1974; Studdert^\u00f6/., 1974) .\n\na. Subclinical Infection in Horses. There have been quite a number of isolations from clinically healthy horses, including the Clydesdale, Thorough bred, and Arabian breeds (Petzoldt and Schmidt, 1971; Harden et al., 1972; Wilks and Studdert, 1973) . In addition, antibody has been found in horses with no history of respiratory tract disease (Darbyshire and Pereira, 1964; Afshar, 1969; Timoney, 1971; Harden^\u00ab/., 1974) .\n\nDisease. An association is emerging between acute, nonfatal respiratory tract disease in horses and equine adenovirus infection. Virus has been isolated from nasal swabs taken from horses with rhinitis, mucopurulent discharge, and coughing (Todd, 1969; McChesney et al., 1973; Dutta, 1975; Moorthy and Spradbrow, 1978) .\n\nc. Fatal Pneumonia. Foals between 10 and 46 days were affected, and the disease lasted 10-56 days. The foals were thin, depressed, and tired rapidly. Persistent nasal and ocular discharge and occasional diarrhea were evident. Dys pnea, polypnea, and a nonproductive cough were features Thompson et al., 1975) . Hematological examination revealed an absolute lymphopenia and neutropenia in the foals which died. No HI antobidy could be detected. In-contact foals were infected with equine adenovirus and developed respiratory signs and HI antibody, but did not show the severe lymphopenia . In the foals which died, rhinitis, tracheitis, pulmonary atelectasis, bronchopneumonia, and lymphoid atrophy were seen. Microscopi cally, there was necrosis of and large basophilic intranuclear inclusions in the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, urinary tract, conjunctiva, pancreas, and focally in the intestine McGuire and Poppie, 1973) . These foals lacked bone marrow-derived (B) lymphocytes, as shown by the lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia (IgM and IgA could not be detected) and by the absence of germinal centers in the lymph nodes and spleen. They also lacked thymus-derived (T) lymphocytes, as indicated by thymic hypoplasia and the absence of thymic-dependent lymphoid tissue (periarteriolar lymphocytic sheaths) in the lymph nodes and spleen. These immunological deficiencies sug gest that there might be a genetic component of this condition McGuire and Poppie, 1973) . Following a study of the percentage of affected foals in Australia, Thompson et al. (1975) suggested that the immuno deficiency was due to a simple recessive autosomal gene. These authors consider that the basic reason for the fatal pneumonia is the immunodeficiency and not the adenovirus.\n\nThe equine adenovirus differs from most of the other isolates in being able to grow in a range of cells. Primary horse kidney (HK) cells appear the most sensitive. An equine dermis cell line has been reported equally sensitive (Konishi et al., 1977) and has been used for virus isolation (Ardans et al., 1973) , but other workers have found it less satisfactory Studdert et al., 1974 ). An equine kidney (EK) cell line has also been used for isolation (Moorthy and Spradbrow, 1978) . El causes a CPE in a range of cells, fetal PK cells have been shown to be as sensitive as HK cells (Konishi et al., 1977) , and bovine cells are virtually as sensitive as HK cells .\n\nSerological studies can be undertaken using the HI test, with human erythrocytes as the indicator system (Studdert et al., 1974) .\n\nICH virus (Cl) and the virus associated with infectious laryngotracheitis (A26/61) (Ditchfield et al., 1962) can be distinguished using the HI test. But while antiserum to Cl neutralized only Cl, antiserum to A26/61 neutralized both viruses to the same titer (Ditchfield et al., 1962) . However, it should be noted that the antiserum to A26/61 had apparently been prepared in dogs previously given Cl-attenuated vaccine. Using both the HI and SN tests, it was possible to divide seven isolates into CI or A26/61 types (Swango et al., 1969) . But using purified reagents, it was shown that antiserum to Cl hexons would neutralize both Cl and A26/61 viruses, whereas antiserum to A26/61 hexons would neutralize only A26/61 virus. Using antisera prepared to the fibers, the HI test indicated a similar one-way cross, but in the SN test these fiber antisera were type specific (Marusyk, 1972) . When antiserum to the virion was tested against complete soluble hemagglutinin as antigen, the two types of virus were readily differenti ated (Marusyk, 1972; Wright et al., 1972) .\n\nThere are other reasons why A26/61 should be considered a separate serotype. The viruses have different fiber lengths and the viral capsid components carry different ionic charges, as demonstrated by anion exchange chromatography (Marusyket al., 1970) . The Cl and A26/61 viruses have different hemagglutinin receptors on erythrocytes (Marusyk and Yamamoto, 1971) , and DNA-DNA hybridization studies indicate a genetic relationship of 70% between these vi ruses (Marusyk and Hammarskjold, 1972) . Also, the pattern of replication dif fers, with Cl behaving like cytopathology subgroup A and A26/61 resembling cytopathology subgroup B (Adair, 1979) .\n\nOne reason for considering Cl and A26/61 as the same serotype is that A26/61 protects dogs against infection with Cl (Fairchild^ a/., 1969).\n\nThese viruses are widely distributed.\n\nFollowing oral infection, Cl replicated in the tonsils and then traveled via the drainage lymph nodes and lymph to the blood. The viremia occurred 4 -6 days PI and lasted 1-3 days. Virus was in the kidney from day 5-7 to at least day 23, and there was irregular excretion in the urine for up to 161 days PI. Virus was isolated from the tonsillar swabs from days 1-7, with peak titers on days 2 and 3. Minimal quantities of virus were excreted in the feces (Poppensiek and Baker, 1951; Salenstedt, 1963; Hamilton et al., 1966) . Leukopenia accompanied the viremia and pyrexia and was followed by an intense leukocytosis (Hamilton et al., 1966) . The minimal dose required for oral infection was between 40 and 400 TCIDso (Salenstedt, 1963) .\n\nDamage to the vacular endothelium and to liver cells was widespread (Rubarth, 1947) . Lesions occurred in the liver from day 7 to 11 and were maximal in the CNS at days 8 and 9, and nephritis was seen from day 11 (Hamilton et al., 1966) . Nephritis resulted from virus in the glomerular epithelial and mesengial cells in the larger renal vessels, causing marked cellular degenerative changes in both glomeruli and tubular epithelium. Swelling of the affected cells resulted in partial or complete occlusion of both capillaries and urinary spaces, leading to proteinuria and viruria. At this stage, there was no deposit of immune complexes (Poppensiek and Baker, 1951; Wright et al., 1973) . These interstitial lesions appeared to be a type IV (cell-mediated) hypersensitivity reaction in which epithelial cells containing viral antigen were surrounded by macrophages and lymphocytes .\n\nAt the height of the disease, when antibody was developing but had not yet reached high levels, circulating immune complexes were formed . It has been suggested that the glomerulonephritis associated with ICH is due to the deposition of these complexes (Kurtz et al., 1972) , and this has been confirmed by the identification of IgG and Cl antigen in the glomeruli of naturally occurring cases (Morrison et al., 1975) . These proliferative glomerulonephritic lesions are transient and do not lead to permanent damage.\n\nDuring the viremic phase, the virus enters the anterior chamber of the eye and infects the endothelial cells, producing a primary iridiocyclitis. This may resolve without sequellae or the virus may persist. This results in a type III hypersensitiv ity reaction, with the formation of immune complexes in the aqueous fluid. These complexes are phagocytosed and the corneal epithelium is attacked, lead ing to corneal edema and the characteristic \"blue eye\" (Carmichael, 1964) .\n\nThe pathogenesis and pathological changes induced by Cl depend on the route of entry. An isolate from a dog with acute hepatitis (Wright et al., 1970) pro-duced severe respiratory tract disease in dogs when given intratracheally or by aerosol (Wright et al., 1970 (Wright et al., , 1971 . The route of infection may well affect the pattern of excretion. Thus although classical ICH virus was not airborne (Baker et al., 1950) when dogs were infected by the respiratory route, airborne infection occurred (Wright et al., 1971) .\n\nFollowing combined intranasal and intratracheal inoculation of an A26/61 type virus, a viremia occurred, and unlike Cl, virus was recovered from throat swabs for 8 days and rectal swabs for 10 days. Only sporadic isolations were made from urine (Swangoef a/., 1970).\n\na. Canine Adenovirus 1 (ICH) Virus 1. Subclinical. Cl virus has been isolated from the respiratory tract of nor mal dogs (Campbell et al., 1968) and also from kidney cells grown from healthy dogs.\n\n2. Generalized Infection. This condition was initially described by Rubarth (1947) . It varied in degree from fatal disease to mild illness. Following an incubation period of 2-14 days, the signs seen were a biphasic pyrexia, anorex ia, ocular and nasal discharge, conjunctivitis, hyperemia of the oral mucus membranes, and vomiting. Hepatitis was rare, and there was subcutaneous edema of the head, neck, and body (Rubarth, 1947; Pay, 1950) .\n\nThe basic lesions were hepatitis, lymphadenitis, and vascular damage. Histological examination revealed a severe hepatitis with focal parenchymal necrosis, with intranuclear inclusions (Fig. 5c) . When examined using immunofluorescence, antigen was present in large amounts in the liver and also in the lymph nodes, spleen, and tonsils (Rubarth, 1947; Wrights al., 1972) .\n\nIt has also been suggested that Cl infection can give a chronic hepatitis (Gocke et al., 1970) , but this has not been confirmed.\n\n3. Respiratory Infection. Cl has been isolated from the turbin\u00e2tes of dogs suffering from severe rhinitis .\n\nCl has also been isolated from dogs suffering from mild to severe respiratory tract disease, where there were lesions in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts (Binn et al., 1967; Studdert and Studdert, 1972; Wright et al., 1972) . It has been possible to reproduce respiratory tract disease in dogs using a Cl virus from a fatal case of ICH (Wright et al., 1971 ) and using a Cl virus isolated from a natural outbreak of respiratory disease . Following aerosol exposure, the dogs were dull and pyrexic and had respiratory signs. At autopsy there was dull red consolidation of the lungs, with focal areas of pulmonary edema and a severe necrotizing bronchiolitis. There was also focal necrosis in the turbin\u00e2tes, nasal epithelium, and tonsils. Viral inclusions and the antigen were detected in necrotizing bronchiolar epithelial cells and in turbinate and tonsillar cells . (Carmichael, 1964; Curtis and Barnett, 1973; Carmichael et al., 1975) .\n\n5. Other Conditions. Cl infection has also been associated with encephalopathy (Salyi and Knapp, 1958; Wright, 1967) and with focal interstitial nephri tis (Poppensiek and Baker, 1951; Hamilton et al., 1966) . It has been suggested that Cl infection could be an important cause of chronic renal filure (Bush and Evans, 1972) , but other workers could not incriminate the virus .\n\nb. A26/61 Toronto Virus. This virus was isolated from dogs with pharyngotracheitis (Ditchfield et al., 1962) . .Other workers have also associated this virus with respiratory tract disease (Binn et al., 1967) , and experimental work has confirmed this. Thus, following a combined nasal-trach\u00e9al route of infec tion, signs and lesions were confined to the respiratory tract. There was a prolif erating necrotizing bronchitis and bronchiolitis, and large intranuclear inclusions were seen in the bronchial epithelial and alveolar septal cells (Swango et al., 1976) .\n\nThe canine adenoviruses are easily isolated in canine kidney cell cultures and in the MDCK cell line (Cabasso et al., 1954; Yamamoto, 1966; Danskin, 1973) . Cl virus will also replicate in pig, raccoon, and ferret kidney cells (Fieldsteel and Yoshihara, 1957; Bolin et al., 1958; Emery and York, 1958) . The virus, in common with other adenoviruses, affects the epithelial cells (Cabasso et al., 1954) . Hemagglutinin is produced in the cell fluid, and the isolate can be typed against appropriate serum. Mouse ascitic fluid is often used as a source of antibody (Wright and Burns, 1966) . Organ culture of dog trachea can also be used . Immunofluorescent staining of liver sections from cases of ICH has proved both quick and sensitive (Wright and Burns, 1966) .\n\nSerological investigations can be undertaken using the SN (Carmichael et al., 1963) or HI test. Following thermal inactivation and kaolin treatment, the sera are tested for HI antibody using human cells (Espmark and Salenstedt, 1961; Marusyk and Yamamoto, 1971 ).\n\nViruses derived from rhesus (Macaca mulatta), patas (Erythrocebus patas), and vervet (Cercopithecus aethiops) monkeys fall into 16 species (Hull et al., 1956 (Hull et al., , 1958 Tyrrell et al., 1960; Malherbe and Harwin, 1963; Pereira et al., 1963 ; (Table V) . SV23 and SV39 could be distinguished using the HI test but are similar using the SN test and are classified as one species, S6. S10 and S14, although similar using the HI test, could be distinguished using the SN test and are therefore classified separately (Rapoza, 1967; Hull, 1968) . Viruses isolated from vervet monkeys were identified as either S3 or an unclassified type, V340 (Kim et al., 1967) , and isolates from baboons (Papio species) were either S16 or V340 (Eugster\u00e9tf\u00fbr/., 1969) .\n\nThere was no crossing between SI-15 and 22 human adenoviruses, using both HI and SN tests, except that S2 and S7 neutralized H25 and H12, respec tively, at very low dilutions (Hull, 1968) .\n\nViruses have been isolated from chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) by a number of workers (Rowe et al., 1956; Hillis and Goodman, 1969; Basnight et al., 1971) . Unfortunately, most of these isolates do not appear to have been compared. The relationship of some of the chimpanzee and human adenoviruses has been discussed in Section II.\n\nNeutralizing antibody to SVI5 and V340 is widespread in primates, including man(Kinm a/., 1967).\n\nSome strains (SI, S2, S3, S4, S6, and S10) are more often isolated from the respiratory tract, while other strains are frequently isolated from feces (Hull, 1968) .\n\na. None. Adenoviruses have been isolated from normal animals or from latently infected cells (Malherbe and Harwin, 1963; Bullock, 1965; Hillis and Goodman, 1969; Basmight et al., 1971) . b. Pneumoenteritis. Eugster et al. (1969) described outbreaks in young baboons 1-2 weeks postpartum from which V340 and three SA7 viruses were isolated. Kim et al. (1967) isolated V340 and S3 viruses from vervet monkeys with chronic interstitial type pneumonia and enteritis. S10 strains were isolated from a number of monkeys with pneumonia and diarrhea (Bullock, 1965 ). An S4 virus was isolated from patas monkeys suffering from an epidemic of conjuncti vitis and rhinorrhea (Tyrrell et al., 1960) .\n\nc. Enteritis. A number of workers have reported the isolation of adenoviruses from monkeys with diarrhea (Hoffert et al., 1958; Rapoza et al., 1961; Hull et al., 1968) .\n\nd. Other Conditions. Chandler et al. (1974) have reported the association of adenovirus infection with necrotizing pancreatitis in a rhesus monkey. S3(SV15),S4(SV17), S6(SV23),S9(SV31), S10(SV32),S14(SV37) S1(SV1),S2(SV11), S5(SV20),S7(SV25), S8(SV30),S11(SV33), S12(SV34),S15(SV38) S16 ( (S6, S14) S1,S2, S5, S7,S8,S11 S12, S15 S16 (1978) . Note that these numbers differ from those proposed by Pereira er al. (1963) . h Based on Rapoza (1967) . ( Based on Gilden et al. (1968) , Huebner et al. (1962) , Hull et al. (1965) , and Slifkin et al. (1968) . Burnett et al. (1972) found that S6 and S14 are not oncogenic. d Based on Goodheart (1971) . Note that Burnett et al. (1972) obtained similar results, except that they found S12 had a density of 1.72 and S12 had a density of 1.71. e Based on Burnett et al. (1972) . Note that S5 and S8 have also been included in this group. They are not as closely related as members of other groups are to one another. / All gave 4-32 fold higher titers at 4\u00b0C than at 37\u00b0C, except S7 (SV25) and S8 and (SV30). * Serotypes S2 (SVI 1), S7 (SV25), S8 (SV30), and S16 (SA7) did not agglutinate these erythrocytes.\n\nThe monkey adenoviruses apparently grow only in cells of simian origin and probably best in primary homologous kidney cells. All grow in the monkey cell line LLC-MK2 except S13 (Hull, 1958) . The isolates from chimpanzees also grow in human cells (Basnight et al., 1971 ) .\n\nThe HI test, using sensitive rat erythrocytes at 4\u00b0C, is suitable for all strains, except for S13 when rhesus cells must be used and S16 when the SN test is required.\n\nThere are two serotypes of mouse adenovirus (van der Veen and Mes, 1974) , represented by the FL strain (Hartley and Rowe, 1960) and the K87 strain (Hashimoto et al., 1966) . Wigand et al. (1977) disagreed and demonstrated a one-way cross, with antiserum to K87 neutralizing both antigens to the same titer but antiserum to FL only neutralizing itself.\n\nThe isolate of Missal (1969) appears to be unclassified.\n\nTwo out of 11 mice colonies tested had CF antibody, and infection in these colonies ranged from 45 to 96% (Hartley and Rowe, 1960) . Another survey found that 11% of mouse colonies tested were infected (Parker et al., 1966) .\n\nThe FL strain of virus was found in the urine and nasal tissue but not in the saliva or feces. Infection is transmitted to in-contacts in the same cage but not in the same room. Maternal antibody is protective (Hartley and Rowe, 1960) . The FL strain given intraperitoneally to adult mice produced a persistent infection of the kidneys, shown by an extensive mononuclear cell infiltration of the cortex and medulla and tubular necrosis. These changes predisposed to pyelonephritis (Ginder, 1965) . Similar adenovirus effects have also been described in dogs (Ginder, 1974) . In adult mice with an inapparent infection, a viruria lasting for months or years was found (van der Veen and Mes, 1973) .\n\nThe K87 strain produced an intestinal infection, with peak fecal titers for 1-2 weeks after infection and virus continuing to be excreted for up to 4 weeks. No excretion was detected in oronasal excretions or urine (Sugiyama^/ al., 1967) .\n\nThe FL strain was isolated from an apparently latently infected culture (Hartley and Rowe, 1960) and the K87 strain from the feces of apparently healthy mice (Hashimotoet al., 1966) . (Hartley and Rowe, 1960; Heck et al., 1972) . In newborn mice, lesions and intranuclear inclusions are seen in a number of organs, includ ing myocardium and brown fat. The FL strain inoculated into mice with an Ehrlich's ascitic form of carcinoma produced a fatal illness. The main areas of adenovirus replication were the lung and ascitic cells (Schmidt-Ruppin, 1968) . No disease was produced by other strains in both suckling and weaned mice (Sugiyama^\u00f6/., 1967; Missal, 1969) .\n\nMouse kidney cells, and preferably young primary cultures, are the most sensitive. Some mouse cell lines are sensitive, while other mouse cell lines and cells from other species, including rat, are not (Hartley and Rowe, 1960; Larsen and Nathans., 1977; Wigand et al., 1977) . There is one report of cytopathology in PK cells (Missal, 1969) .\n\nIsolation of some strains is difficult, requiring up to 56 days of incubation before a good CPE is produced (Hashimoto et al., 1966) .\n\nThe fowl adenoviruses have been classified by a number of workers (Clemmer, 1964; Khanna, 1966; Burke et al., 1968; McFerran et al., 1972; Calnek and Cowen, 1975; McFerran and Connor, 1977; Grimes and King, 1977a) . A proposed classification is shown in Table VI . Although the strains were initially found to be relatively clearly defined, prime strains were found (McFerran et al., 1972) . Strains of broad antigenicity were recognized when an isolate of Khanna (1966) was found to neutralize both 58 and 764 (McFerran et al., 1975) . The presence of prime strains and strains of broad antigenicity has been confirmed by others (Cowen et al., 1977; Grimes and King, 1977a) .\n\nThe fowl adenoviruses have a worldwide distribution. Serological investiga tions have shown that birds on a farm can be infected with many different serotypes. Thus Grimes et al. (1977a) found, when testing 16 flocks for adenovi rus antibody, that titers to the eight serotypes used could be found in 8 flocks and to seven serotypes in 6 flocks. Antibody to F2, F5, F6, and F8 was found in all flocks and F2 and F8 also had the highest titers, while only Fl was found on 11 farms. Although some of this antibody could be due to a heterotypic antibody response, virus isolation studies support the concept that adenovirus infection is widespread (Khanna, 1966; Yatesetal., 1976; Cowen et al., 1978b) . --380 a Based on the classification of b Based on the classifications of McFerran et al. (1972 McFerran et al. ( , 1975 and McFerran c Based on the classification of Calnek and Cowen (1975) . d Based on Adair (1978) . e See text.\n\nOriginal reference USA i-\n\nYates and Fry (1957) Calnek and Cowen (1975) Calnek and Cowen (1975) McFerran and Connor (1977) Connor (1977).\n\nVirus was excreted in the feces for up to 20 days after infection, with peak titers 4 to 7 days after infection (Kohn, 1962; Kawamura et al., 1963; Clemmer and Ichinose, 1968) . Clemmer (1972) was able to distinguish between a juvenile and an adult pattern of virus excretion in the feces, depending on the age of infection. Day-old chicks excreted higher titers of virus for longer periods than did 21-day-old birds. Little information is available on the oronasal secretions as a source of infection, but as virus is often present in the conjunctiva, nasal mucosa, pharynx, and trachea, it seems reasonable to assume that they have a role. Egg transmission is important, and many workers have recorded the pres ence of adenovirus in uninoculated embryonated eggs or cell culture (Yates and Fry, 1957; Burke et al., 1965; Khanna, 1966; Cook, 1968) .\n\nExperimental infection of birds with Fl and F2 viruses by natural routes resulted in widespread dissemination of virus, with maximum virus titers in the trachea and feces (Kohn, 1962; Kawamura \u00a3/al., 1963) .\n\nIn a longitudinal survey of broiler flocks (McFerran et al., 1981) , birds were excreting adenovirus from 2-3 weeks of age, and at least two serotypes were found in each flock. The virus was confined to the intestine, bursa of the Fabricius, and upper respiratory tract, in contrast to the pattern seen in experi mental infection of antibody-free birds with massive doses of virus. In the type of husbandry practiced, with depletion of the flocks and with cleansing and disin fection of the houses between flocks, carryover of virus was not important. The viruses found in these flocks were antigenically similar to those present in the parent flocks of the same organization. Presumably following vertical transmis sion, the virus becomes unmasked with the loss of maternal antibody at 2-4 weeks, and spreads slowly through the flock. Experimental work has shown that maternal antibody is lost within the first 4 weeks of life and that its presence does not prevent infection with some serotypes (Kohn, 1962) , but presumably it does prevent latent virus from becoming activated. Because of the rather frequent isolation of more than one serotype from a bird, it is probable that there is little cross protection on the mucosal surface between species.\n\nThis disease was first recorded in the United States (Helmboldt and Frazier, 1963) . It is normally seen in birds 5-7 weeks of age (Howell et al., 1970; Macpherson et al., 1974) but has been recorded in birds between 2 and 18 weeks (Hoffmann et al., 1975) . The main sign was a sudden increase in mortality, with very few sick birds. Mortality reached 10% and usually peaked on the third and fourth days of onset, with deaths stopping after the fifth day but occasionally continuing for 2.5 weeks (Howell et al., 1970; Pettit and Carlson, 1972; Fadley and Winterfield, 1973; McFerran et al., 1976a) . The main lesions seen were pale, friable, swollen livers. Petechial or ecchymotic hemorrhages may be present in the liver and skeletal muscles (Howell, 1974; Macpherson et al., 1974; McFerran et al., 1976a) . Some workers consid ered anemia the major sign (Stein, 1975) , and German workers suggested the disease be renamed \"hepatomyelopoietic disease\" (Hoffmann et al., 1975) .\n\nEosinophilic inclusions were commonly seen in the hepatocytes of natural cases of IBH (Fig. 5) (Helmboldt and Frazier, 1963; Howell et al., 1970; Bickford et al., 1973; McFerran et al., 1976a) . Basophilic inclusions were rarely seen in field cases of IBH. In a study of the livers of 20 naturally infected birds, eosinophilic inclusions were seen in all, but basophilic inclusions were seen only in 6 birds (Itakura et al., 1974 (Itakura et al., , 1977 . On electron microscopic examination of the livers in naturally occurring cases, these eosinophilic inclusions contained either very few or no adenovirus particles (Pettit and Carlson, 1972; Bickford et al., 1973; McCracken and McFerran, unpublished observations; (Fig. 5 ). Itakura et al. (1977) found that virus particles were detected only in the cells with basophilic inclusions and that the eosinophilic inclusions corresponded to those cells consisting of fibrillar granular material, without viral particles. The lack of virus particles in the eosinophilic inclusions should be compared to the large numbers of particles associated with the basophilic inclusions in the livers of birds with a hepatitis following experimental infection (Figs. 5 and 6) (Bickford et al., 1973; McCracken and McFerran, unpublished observations) .\n\nThe naming of an isolate from IBH as the inclusion body hepatitis virus (Fadley and Winterfield, 1973) was premature because this virus was classified as a type 5 fowl adenovirus (McFerran et al., 1975) , and it is clear that if adenoviruses are associated with the etiology of IBH, then this affinity is not confined to one serotype. Thus Fl (Winterfield et al., 1973), F2, F3, and F4 (McFerran et al., 1976a; Grimes and King, 1977a) , F5 (Fadly and Winterfield, 1973; McFerran et al., 1976a) , F8 (Macpherson et al., 1974; 1976a; Grimes et al., 1977b) , and F9 (Grimes et al., 1978) have all been isolated from clinical outbreaks of IBH. In addition, unclassified adenoviruses have been found (Di Francos//., 1974; Wells and Harrigan, 1974) . It should be noted that reoviruses have also been isolated from some outbreaks (Hoffmann et al., 1975; McFerran et al., 1976a) .\n\nA number of workers have been able to reproduce the syndrome, but usually only by parenteral inoculation of very young chicks (Rosenberger et al., 1974; Grimes et al., 1977b) . One group has reproduced it both by natural routes of infection and in older birds (Fadly and Winterfield, 1973) . Other workers could not reproduce typical lesions even by unnatural routes (Sharpless and Jungherr, 1961; Kawamura and Horiuchi, 1964; McDougall and Peters, 1974; Macpherson et al., 1974) . McCracken et al. (1976) produced a hepatitis when type strains and strains isolated from birds with IBH were inoculated into 5-day-old chicks. These changes occurred with seven fowl and two turkey adenovirus serotypes, but not with Fl strains. It is difficult to reconcile these conflicting findings. It may be that some other agent is also required, a suggestion given substance by the development of a hemorrhagic-aplastic anemia syndrome in one trial which was not associated with adenoviruses (Grimes and King, 1977b) . Some workers have claimed that prior infection with infectious bursal disease virus enhances the pathogenicity of the adenovirus in IBD (Rosenberger et al., 1975; Fadly et al., 1976) , and regression of the bursa of Fabricius in IBD has been described (Pettit and Carlson, 1972; Bickford et al., 1973) . However, results from both natural cases (MacPherson et al., 1974) and experimental infection (Grimes et al., 1977b) suggest that IBD virus is not necessary to produce the IBH syn drome. b. Depressed Egg Production. Winterfield et al. (1973) recorded the isola tion of an Fl (Indiana C) virus from a flock with poor eggshell quality. Other workers have attributed a 10% decline in production to adenovirus infection (Berry, 1969; Cook, 1972) . Adenoviruses were also associated, on the basis of the development of group antigen, with depressed egg production linked to soft-shelled and shell-less eggs in the Netherlands (Van Eck et al., 1976) . McFerran et al. (1978a) , investigating the same syndrome, isolated adenoviruses be longing to serological groups from birds 26 to 40 weeks of age. However, they did not feel that these isolates were of major importance in the syndrome. Workers in the United States (Cowen et al., 1978b) experimentally infected birds with four isolates, including Fl (Indiana C). They had no effect on egg quality, and only one F5 (IBH-2) had a minimal effect on egg production. Furthermore, it is quite common to isolate adenoviruses from uninoculated eggs or cell cultures derived from flocks with normal production (Cook, 1968; McFerran, unpublished observations) .\n\nc. Poor Food Conversion and Poor Growth. A growing complaint from meat chicken producers is poor food conversion or failure to achieve estimated weights for a given age. Schwartz (1975) has reported increased food consump tion associated with adenovirus infection, while other workers (Cowen et al., 1978a) found that birds infected with F5 (IBH-2) had decreased food intake. Grimes and King (1977b) recorded that an F8 (AAG5 (2a)) virus given intraabdominally depressed body weight, and Cook (1974) , using the same route, found that F2 caused a 70% mortality and a significant depression of weight gain in the survivors. Surveys of normal and affected broiler flocks in Northern Ireland during the growing period yielded many isolates of adenovirus, but no differences in the types of serotypes or in the numbers isolated could be estab lished.\n\nd. Tenosynovitis. This condition is usually associated with reovirus infec tion (Olsen and Weiss, 1972) . However, during routine isolations, both adenoviruses and reoviruses have been isolated from these affected joints, and many of these have been Fl, which is not a common isolate in Northern Ireland (McFerran, unpublished observations) . Grimes and King (1977a) also isolated an Fl from synovitis. Mackenzie and Bains (1976) isolated an adenovirus and Staphylococcus aureus from an outbreak of tenosynovitis, and Jones et al. (1978) studied 52 cases and isolated viruses from 20. Twelve of these isolates were reovirus, seven were adenovirus, and one was a mixture of both.\n\ne. Respiratory Tract Disease. A number of groups have recorded the isola tion of adenoviruses from birds with respiratory tract disease (Kawamura et al., 1963; Rinaldi et al., 1968; McDougall and Peters, 1974) . In a study of 94 flocks with respiratory tract disease, adenoviruses were isolated from 44%, whereas 74 flocks without respiratory tract disease produced only a 15% recovery. Also, adenovirus was isolated from the lungs of the birds with respiratory tract disease (McFerran et al., 1971a) . Attempts at experimental reproduction of disease have given equivocal results. Some workers have produced respiratory tract disease or microscopic lesions only following natural routes of infection (Kawamura et al., 1963; Aghakhan and Pattison, 1974) . Other workers have been successful using only intratracheal inoculation (Lim et al., 1973; McDougall and Peters, 1974) or have not reproduced disease (Kawamura and Horiuchi, 1964) .\n\nFollowing the major outbreak of respiratory tract disease in Northern Ireland, a successful program of infectious bronchitis vaccination was introduced. The number of cases of respiratory tract disease has fallen dramatically, while adeno viruses are still widespread. However, examination of the autopsy and virus records suggests that where adenoviruses were isolated from trachea, lung, or air sacs, signs, lesions, and mortality were more severe (McFerran, unpublished observations) .\n\nf. Disease Produced in Fowl by a Duck Adenovirus. In 1976 a new condition affecting laying hens was described in the Netherlands. This was characterized by a fall in egg production and by the production of soft-shelled and shell-less eggs, and the albumin quality was affected. Most cases were in birds around 30 weeks of age, and while the falls could be severe, they returned to normal production in 6-8 weeks (Van Eck?/al., 976) .\n\nA similar condition was described in Northern Ireland except that no effect was seen in the internal quality of the egg (McFerran et al., , 1978a . As in the Dutch birds, no illness was evident and all cases occurred between 26 and 35 weeks, with most between 29 and 31 weeks. Epidemiological evidence sugges ted that the virus was egg transmitted but otherwise had limited powers of lateral spread. Viruses which agglutinated fowl erythrocytes and 17 fowl adenoviruses were isolated from affected flocks. One agent, 127, was selected for further study. The hemagglutinating agents were classified as adenoviruses on the basis of their biochemical properties (Todd and McNulty, 1978) and their physical, chemical, and growth characteristics (Adair et al., 1979b) .\n\nAlthough these viruses did not apparently share a group antigen with other avian adenoviruses using immunodiffusion techniques, the group antigen could be demonstrated by infecting birds previously infected with adenovirus with 127 virus and eliciting a recall of the group antigen (McFerran et al., 1978b) . This would explain the Dutch findings, which on the basis of the DID test indicated that fowl adenoviruses were associated with this syndrome (Van Eck et al., 1976) . A similar virus, BC14, was isolated in England (Baxendale, 1978) . The disease can be experimentally reproduced using BC14 or 127 virus (Baxendale, 1978; McCracken and McFerran, 1978) . The first changes were seen 7 days after oral infection with 127 virus, when loss of shell pigment occurred. This was followed by thinning of the eggshell and then on the ninth day by soft-shelled and shell-less eggs. Eggshell quality was worst at 13-16 days after infection, and the majority of birds had returned to normal egg quality by day 24 (Fig. 7a) .\n\nThe origin of this virus is of interest. It grows better in cells of duck origin than in fowl cells, and it grows to very high titers in embryonated duck eggs but not in embryonated fowl eggs (Adair et al., 1979c) . Fowl sera prior to the importation of the infected birds did not have antibody to 127 virus . Duck flocks in England have antibody, and this virus has been isolated from them (Baxendale, 1978) . Duck flocks but not fowl flocks in the United States also have antibody to 127 virus, and there was evidence that infected ducks did not readily infect fowl (Calnek, 1978) . It seems reasonable to postulate that these viruses are duck adenoviruses. The problem of the widespread distribution of this virus in different breeds in Western Europe and its apparently poor ability to spread from flock to flock is best explained by contamination of a vaccine. It is not related to the prototype fowl or turkey adenovirus.\n\nIt is preferable to use cell culture to isolate fowl adenoviruses. Liver and kidney cells are equally sensitive, but chick embryo fibroblasts are much less sensitive. Chick trach\u00e9al organ cultures are also not sensitive . In addition to examining the organ with lesions, it is advisable to test the pharynx and feces because virus persists in these specimens longer and to higher titers. Normally, two passages of 6 days each are sufficient for isolation, al though a third pass may be given (McFerran et al., 1971 a) .\n\nEmbryonated eggs, although widely used, cannot be recommended for adeno virus isolation. Thus Burke et al. (1959) The DID test has been used for diagnosis and monitoring of specific pathogenfree (SPF) flocks for infection. It has the advantage of being inexpensive and quick, and it detects group antibody. McFerran et al. (1975) drew attention to the failure of SPF birds experimentally infected by a natural route with one serotype always to develop detectable antibody. This observation has been confirmed by others (Grimes et al., 1977a; Yates et al., 1977) . Cowen et al. (1978b) found, when studying naturally infected flocks, that in spite of isolating many adeno viruses especially from the 8-14-week age group, the percentage of birds wtih detectable precipitin antibody rose steadily from 28% in 8-14-week-old birds to 97% in the 30-43-week age group. Apart from the inherent lack of sensitivity of the test, it is probable that more sensitivity could be achieved by using more than one antigen. Thus, although the fowl and turkey adenoviruses tested have a common immunoprecipitin antigen (McFerran et al., 1975) , it is clear from CF studies that this group antigen is not shared to the same extent by all strains (Kawamura^/o/., 1964) .\n\nThe most sensitive test in use is the SN test, and in its microtiter form (Grimes et al., 1977a) it is very useful. Other tests, such as the passive hemagglutination test (Trewick and Lang, 1971; Moreau, 1974) and ELISA (Todd and McFerran, unpublished observations) , have shown promise vut still need to be fully evaluat ed. The radial immunodiffusion test (Pereira et al., 1972; McFerran et al., 1975) is useful for surveys but detects only group antibody.\n\nOne of the main requirements for a sensitive test is to monitor SPF flocks producing eggs for vaccines and research. Often the first indication of infection is the degeneration of control cell cultures on first or second passage. In these circumstances, both cloacal swabbing of the flock and serological testing using the SN test have failed to detect the infected birds, but the use of the indirect immunofluorescence test has been successful (Adair and McFerran, unpublished observations) .\n\nThree classes of adenovirus infect turkeys. These are fowl adenoviruses, tur key adenoviruses, and the virus of turkey hemorrhagic enteritis.\n\na. Fowl Adenoviruses. Fowl adenoviruses type 1 have been isolated from turkeys. These viruses grow in embryonated egg and cell cultures of both fowl and turkey origin (Blalock et al., 1975; Cho, 1976; King, 1977 ). An isolation made in Germany may also be Fl but was not fully characterized (Ahmed, 1971 ). b. Turkey Adenoviruses. A number of workers have reported the isolation of one or more serotypes, but unfortunately comparative studies have not been carried out. Thus two serotypes (TAV1 and TAV2) were described in Northern Ireland (Scott and McFerran, 1972; McFerran et al., 1975) . Two serotypes (WTAV and AMK49) were described in the United States, and WTAV is similar to TAV1 (King and Hanson, 1975; King, 1977) . The NC-120 isolate (Simmons et al., 1976) , and NC-J and NC-K isolates (Sutjipto et al., 1977) , and the MST virus isolated by Domermuth (Easton and Simmons, 1977) were compared (Sut jipto et al., 1977) . Three serotypes were recognized. The NC-120 and MST viruses were identical and were different from the NC-J and NC-K viruses. The turkey viruses studied share a group antigen with the fowl adenoviruses, are not neutralized by the prototype fowl antisera (McFerran et al., 1975) , and either do not grow or grow poorly in cells of fowl origin (Scott and McFerran, 1972; King, 1977) .\n\nc. Turkey Hemorrhagic Enteritis Virus (HEV). HEV has not yet been grown in embryonated eggs or cell culture; therefore, neutralization tests have not been carried out with other avian adenoviruses. The HEV virus and the virus associated with marble spleen disease (MSV) of pheasants are very closely related. They share a common antigen (Domermuth and Gross, 1975; Iltis et al., 1975; Silim et al., 1978) . Marble spleen disease virus (MSDV) will infect pheasants and turkeys, producing lesions. These lesions could be prevented by the use of HEV antiserum (Domermuth et al., 1975; Iltis etal., 1975) .\n\nThese viruses can be classified as adenoviruses on the basis of their size of 70-90 nm and their morphology (Carlson et al., 1973; Fujiwara et al., 1975; Tolin and Domermuth, 1975; Iltis et al., 1977) . Also, they are resistant to chloroform (Domermuth et al., 1975) and have a density of 1.32-1.34 gm/ml in CsCl (Carlson et al., 1974; Iltis, 1975) . MSV contains DNA (Iltis, 1975) , and both HEV and MSDV replicate intranuclearly in the cells of the reticuloendothelial system, primarily in the spleen (Itakura and Carlson, 1975; Fujiwara et al., 1975) . There are conflicting reports in the literature on whether they share a group antigen with avian and mammalian adenoviruses. Iltis et al. (1977) claimed that MSDV shares an antigen with TA1 and TA2 turkey adenoviruses. However, other workers have failed to show this relationship with fowl adenoviruses (Jakowski and Silim etal., 1978) .\n\nAntibody to turkey isolates is widespread in the United States (Simmons et al., 1976) , and in Northern Ireland 70% of 20-week-old birds had antibody to TAV1 (Scott, 1974) .\n\nHEV has been recorded in the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, India, and Israel (Domermuth and Gross, 1978) , and antibody has been found in all flocks tested, although only half had signs of disease (Beasley and Wisdom, 1978) . Scott (1974) infected turkeys by a combined oral-intranasal route. Virus was reisolated from most organs on day 4, suggesting a viremia. Virus persisted in the respiratory tract until the seventh day and in the alimentary tract and feces until the eleventh day after infection. From experience gained in growing kidney cell cultures derived from embryos and young poults, obtained from commercial sources, it is clear that turkey adenoviruses can be transmitted in the embryo and can remain latent in kidney cells.\n\nAlthough viruses were isolated from turkeys aged 10 days to 6 months (Scott and McFerran, 1972) , antibody studies indicate that birds 4 -6 weeks of age are frequently devoid of antibody. However, this was present in 10-week and older birds (Scott, 1974) .\n\nHEV occurs in 6-12-week-old birds and is most common in 10-12-week-old birds (Domermuth and Gross, 1978) , but it has been seen in 2.5-week-old birds (Harris and Domermuth, 1977) . It appears that the resistance of young poults to infection is not due to maternal antibody (Beasley and Wisdom, 1978) . Turkeys are susceptible to oral infection with HEV (Gross and Moore, 1967) . Following infection there is a viremia, and the highest virus titers are found in the spleen (Domermuth et al., 1972) . The turkey is susceptible to oral infection (Gross and Moore, 1967) . There is no evidence of egg transmission or vectors, and it is considered that infection persists in the litter between crops of birds (Domermuth and Gross, 1978) . HEV will infect fowl if given intraperitoneally or orally, and fowl kept in contact with infected fowl also become infected. Lesions compara ble to those seen in turkeys develop (Silim^r al., 1978) .\n\na. None. Conventional fowl and turkey adenoviruses have been isolated from clinically normal turkeys (Scott and McFerran, 1972; Cho, 1976) . Using turkey strains to infect turkeys, no evidence of disease could be obtained (Scott, 1974; Simmons et al., 1976; Sutjipto et al., 1977) . Similar results were obtained with Fl virus (Yates and Fry, 1957) .\n\nb. Respiratory Disease. Viruses have been isolated from the respiratory tract of turkeys with respiratory tract disease (Scott and McFerran, 1972; Blalock et al., 1975; Simmons et al., 1976; Sutjipto et al., 1977) . Blalock et al. (1975) elicited a respiratory response when their Fl isolate was inoculated into turkeys. Cho (1976) , using another Fl isolate, claimed to have produced hepatitis, respi ratory tract disease, bursal atrophy, and growth depression in both chicks and poults. However the possibility of infectious bursal disease (IBD) virus infection was not eliminated since the affected organs were not examined by immunofluorescence or electron microscopy. Therefore the possibility exists that adenoviruses alone were not responsible for these lesions. Adenoviruses were isolated from a severe upper respiratory tract disease of young turkeys. But attempts to repro-duce this condition have failed, although mild disease was produced with some strains (Simmons et al., 1976; Dillman and Simmons, 1977; Sutjipto et al., 1977) . Page et al. (1978) have shown that these birds had antibody to IBD virus, which had not previously been recognized in turkeys, and suggested that turkeys might be infected with IBD, which could interfere with the immune response. This suggestion was opportune, as IBD virus has now been isolated from turkeys (McNultyeftf/., 1979) .\n\nc. Other Conditions. Isolates have been made from birds with diarrhea and depressed egg production, but their significance is unknown (Scott and McFerran, 1972; King, 1977) .\n\nd. Hemorrhagic Enteritis. This condition was first recognized in turkeys in Minnesota (Pomeroy and Fenstermacher, 1937) . Following a 5-6-day incuba tion period, there was sudden depression and thirst, and blood was seen in the feces. Mortality varied from nil to 60% (Gross and Moore, 1967) . Experimental infection resulted in mortalities of 0-80%, depending on the virulence of the virus (Domermuth and Gross, 1978) . Death occurred in a few hours or the birds recovered. The pathology has been described by a number of authors (Gross, 1967; Itakura and Carlson, 1975; Fujiwara et al., 1975) . The main lesions were splenomegaly, congestion of the small intestine, and hemorrhagic contents of the intestine. Microscopically, there was an acute hemorrhagic enteritis, degenera tive changes of the lymphoid tissue, and proliferation of reticuloendothelial cells in all areas. Intranuclear inclusions were seen in the large mononuclear cells in visceral organs and in reticular cells around sheathed arteries of the spleen. Death was probably due to bleeding from damaged capiallaries in the tips of the villi. The HEV or a similar virus of chickens has been isolated from the enlarged spleens of birds condemned for Marek's disease (Domermuth, 1979) .\n\nTo isolate turkey adenoviruses, as opposed to fowl adenoviruses affecting turkeys, it is necessary to use turkey embryo kidney or liver cells or turkey kidney cells. Turkey fibroblasts are not sensitive (McFerran, unpublished obser vations) . Some turkey adenoviruses can be isolated on the first or second passage (Scott, 1974) . But other viruses required up to nine passages in cell culture before isolation (Simmons and Gray, 1976) . Although initial isolations were made in turkey kidney cells (Simmons et al., 1976) , in a comparative study, turkey embryo liver cells but not turkey kidney cells detected virus on initial isolation. Both cells were sensitive on subsequent passage (Simmons and Gray, 1976) . With these slow-growing adenoviruses, turkey adenoviruses had to be neutralized with antibody. Acridine orange was found to be helpful in detecting viral presence (Simmons and Gray, 1976) . As suggested for the bovine adeno viruses, FA staining might be of major help.\n\nHEV has not been grown in cell culture or embryonated eggs (Domermuth et al., 1972; Carlson et al., 1974) . Therefore virus isolation involves inoculation of turkeys. Turkeys 6-10 weeks old are infected orally with feces or intravenously with spleen extract of affected birds. Deaths should occur 3 days after intrave nous or 5-6 days after oral infection. Birds not dying should have enlarged spleens. These spleens or spleens from dying birds can be used as an antigen in a DID test (Domermuth et al., 1973) . Birds not dying will develop precipitating antibody after 2 weeks, and peak titers are reached around 4 weeks.\n\nAn adenovirus has been isolated from pheasant chicks and identified as an adenovirus by the presence of group antigen (Cakala, 1966) . The relationship of MSDV to the adenovirus group and to turkey hemorrhagic enteritis has already been considered.\n\nMSD has been recognized in Italy (Mandelli et al., 1966) , Canada (Carlson et al., 1973) , England (Bygrave and Pattison, 1973) , and the United States .\n\nIn view of its close relationship to HEV, it is likely that MSD behaves in a similar fashion. Pheasants 4 -8 months old are commonly affected, but MSD can occur in younger birds Bygrave and Pattison, 1973) .\n\nThe disease in pheasants produced by MSDV resembles the disease in turkeys produced by HEV, except that MSDV does not produce gut lesions in pheasants or turkeys and death appears to be due to pulmonary edema. Usually birds are found dead. At autopsy, splenomegaly with varying confluent gray foci of necro sis (marble spleen) and intensely congested and edematous lungs were observed. Focal necrosis around the tertiary bronchi of the lungs and of the germinal follicles of the spleen was observed. Masses of pale eosinophilic fibrinoid-type material, not amyloid, was seen around blood vessels and the areas of necrosis Bygrave and Pattison, 1973; Carlson et al., 1974) . Eosino philic and basophilic inclusions were seen in the lung and spleen and eosino philic inclusions in some liver cells. It is interesting that in experimental trans mission studies, neither death nor the full spectrum of MSD lesions was found. This led Iltis et al. (1975) to suggest that some synergistic factor must be required.\n\nThe history and pathological signs are usually sufficient. However, the tech niques suggested for HEV are suitable.\n\nQuail bronchitis was described in bobwhite quail (Colinies virginianus) by Olson (1950) . This condition has a short incubation period and sudden onset in young birds. Mortality can reach 100%, and it is highly contagious. The signs are rales, coughing, depression, nervous signs, and in some birds conjunctivitis (Olson, 1950; Dubose et al., 1958) . The virus isolated from this condition has been shown to be identical to Fl (Yates and Fry, 1957; Dubose and Grumbles, 1959) .\n\nFl has also been isolated from guinea fowl with pancreatitis (Pascucci et al., 1973) . F2 and F8 have been isolated from budgerigars, F5 from a mallard duck, and F8 from pigeons (McFerran et al., 1976b) .\n\nIt is interesting that fowl adenoviruses have been isolated from a number of avian species. It is not clear if this means that they share one group of viruses or if the failure to detect other avian viruses simply reflects the failure to use homologous cell cultures. The second reason appears more feasible, because turkeys are infected with turkey adenoviruses in addition to fowl adenoviruses. The turkey viruses do not grow in fowl cells and are unrelated to fowl adenovirus serotypes.\n\nVaccines are mainly used in canine and to a lesser degree in bovine and avian medicine. Both inactivated and attenuated vaccines are used for the control of ICH in dogs. The attenuated vaccines have proved very effective. However, not only is the vaccine virus excreted in the urine, but it may result in focal intersti tial nephritis (Appel et al., 1973) . In addition, it may cause corneal edema, which is usually transient, provided corticosteroids are not used. One study suggests that over 0.4% of vaccinated dogs may have \"blue eye\" following vaccination (Curtis and Barnett, 1973) . The immunity following inactivated vaccine appears less effective, and this has led to some manufacturers to rec ommend repeated revaccination. This procedure could lead to the development of circulating immune complexes and glomerulonephritis, as suggested by Mur ray and Wright (1974) , but there is no direct evidence for this. Because A26/61 has been associated only with lesions of the respiratory tract, it has been sugges ted that an attenuated strain would be suitable for protection of dogs against both ICH and ILT (Appel et al., 1973) . A commercial A26/61 vaccine is now in use. Some work has been carried out using both inactivated and attenuated vaccines in the control of adenovirus infection in cattle (Tribe et al., 1969; Burki, 1973; Bartha, 1974) . Bartha (1974) has suggested that immunization with Bl and B8 would provide protection against the other members of the subgroups, but this remains to be confirmed. A temperature-sensitive mutant of B3 has also been produced (Zygraich et al., 1976 ).\n\nAn inactivated vaccine prepared against the hemagglutinating adenovirus as sociated with falls in production has been prepared (Baxendale, 1978) , and it appears to be effective.\n\nAlthough not enough information is available to make valid judgments, it would appear that some of the adenoviruses discussed tend to grow in the upper respiratory tract and others to colonize the intestines. Norrby et al. (1976) sug gest that vertical transmission of adenoviruses does not occur. This may be true for human adenoviruses, but is not true for the animal viruses. In many species, and especially in the fowl, vertical transmission may be the main factor in the epidemiology.\n\nSome of the adenoviruses discussed are clearly associated with disease, but the majority appear to be normally not associated with disease and require the presence of some as yet undefined factor(s) before they cause recognizable signs and lesions.\n\nSurprisingly differences are found in the ease of isolating adenoviruses from different species. Thus it is easy to isolate fowl and canine adenoviruses and difficult to isolate bovine and porcine adenoviruses. Apart from inherent differ ences in the ability of adenoviruses to replicate in cell cultures, other factors may be important. It appears that they grow best in primary epithelial cells from the homologous species, and with some types (e.g., the group 2 bovines) these epithelial cells must be from certain organs. Some of the differences reported may be due to the percentage of epithelial cells in the cultures. Cells grown from bovine testes or embryo fowl liver can all too often end up as fibroblast cultures. Furthermore, the cells may contain latent adenovirus or, in the case of bovine cells, latent or noncytopathic bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) virus. Furthermore, BVD virus may be introduced into other cell lines through the use of contami nated fetal calf serum. As a first step, all cultures should be tested for the presence of BVD virus by immunofluorescence. It may also be advisable, espe cially where low titers of stock pools are found, to treat them with chloroform to remove possible contaminants. Adeno-associated parvoviruses can also cause a major reduction in the titer of pools and, where possible, should be removed.\n\nOne of the problems with adenoviruses of certain species is the time required to identify the adenovirus effect on cell cultures, as for example, the five blind passages in calf-tested cells to isolate a B8 strain (Rondhuis, 1973) . It is probable that the use of immunofluorescence would help to reduce the time. Furthermore, in investigating major syndromes, convalescent serum can be used in the indirect immunofluorescence test to aid in viral detection. Convalescence or pooled serum collected from old animals can also be used most successfully for immunoelectron microscopy (McFerran and McNulta, 1978c [Fig. 8] ). Possibly not enough attention has been paid to the metabolism of the cells, since for the growth of a number of strains, actively dividing cells are required. "}
