{"title": "Potential biochemical markers to identify severe cases among COVID-19 patients", "body": "To date, the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is the greatest public health problem in the world. By 10:30 on Mar 19, 2020, the cumulative number of confirmed cases had reached 218,785 globally, including 8,949 deaths. Of the total confirmed COVID-19 patients, about 19.9% were severe cases [1] , which have a mortality rate of about 20%. Severe cases often suffer from underlying diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes that can accelerate the progression of 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection [2, 3] . Furthermore, acute respiratory distress syndrome could lead to death in some severe COVID-19 patients, and this is often accompanied by heart failure, liver failure, and kidney failure [2, 4] . Therefore, early, simple and effective diagnosis of severe COVID-19 pneumonia is of great significance in reducing mortality and shortening the hospitalization period.\n\n2 All rights reserved.

However, these criteria are susceptible to subjective and objective factors, which may lead to an extended time for diagnosing and the possibility of misdiagnosing severe COVID-19. Therefore, it makes sense to find a potential biomarker that could effectively diagnose severe COVID-19.\n\nIn this study, we investigated and analysed more than 4,000 test results from 28 COVID-19\n\npatients. The concentrations of 6 serum biochemical markers showed significant differences between severe and mild COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, the levels of serum biomarkers reflecting glomerular filtration function (including cystatin C (CysC), creatinine (CREA), and urea) in severe COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those in mild patients. It has been demonstrated that serum urea, CREA and CysC could be potential biomarkers that could rapidly and specifically reflect severe COVID-19, and it is of great significance in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 to reduce the mortality and shorten the hospitalization period for patients with severe COVID-19. Moreover, glomerular filtration injury in patients with severe COVID-19 should not be ignored by clinicians.\n\nThe study enrolled patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University and The Fourth People's Hospital of Zunyi city from January 29, 2020 to February 21, 2020. The exclusion criteria were based on the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia [6] .

The incidence of liver or heart failure was higher in severe COVID-19 patients [2, 4] ; however, we found that most of the indicators, including liver and cardiac function biomarkers, except for serum DBIL, CHE and LDH, did not change significantly or directly in severe and mild patients. There were not much consistent with some reports in the literature [2] , which may be the result of prophylactic use of drug by doctors. There were also no differences in serum CRP concentrations between severe and mild COVID-19 patients; however, the overall level of serum CRP increased, suggesting that it could be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nThe results of renal injury were similar with 2003 SARS-CoV [8] , a close relative of 7 All rights reserved.

We also found that serum urea, CREA, and CysC, which are biochemical markers of renal function, were significantly elevated in severe COVID-19 patients, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection could damage the kidney, and this is consistent with part of the latest findings [9] . Furthermore, there were no differences in the serum HCO 3- results between severe and mild COVID-19 patients, and this further suggests that the glomerulus could be one of the target organs for the coronavirus in severe patients and may be related to the high expression of ACE2 in glomerular cells [10, 11] .\n\nTwo limitations are inherent in our study. First, the survey area is relatively limited.\n\nAdditionally, the relatively small number of participants in the survey may not fully reflect the overall situation. Thus, further studies are necessary to execute a large number of data surveys in multiple regions by multi-centre cooperation.\n\nHerein, we found that some serum indicators of glomerular function, including urea, CREA, and CysC, were observably higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild COVID-19\n\npatients. This result indicates that serum urea, CREA, and CysC could be used as potential biochemical biomarkers to identify a severe COVID-19 patient. Moreover, clinicians should constantly monitor the glomerular filtration function while treating patients with a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection."}
