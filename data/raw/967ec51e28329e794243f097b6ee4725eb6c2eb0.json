{"title": "", "body": "Michael G. Davidson, D.v.M.\n\nThe term fundus literally means the internal surface of an organ, farthest away from its opening. The fundus of the eye is therefore the internal, posterior section of the eye that is seen with an ophthalmoscope. In small animals, the fundus is a composite of several different tissues including the optic nerve, sensory retina (and retinal blood vessels), choroid, tapetum (which is part of the choroid), and sclera.\n\nThe fundus is examined by a technique known as ophthalmoscopy, which can be performed with either a direct method or an indirect method after the pupil is dilated with tropicamide. The direct method uses a direct ophthalmoscope headpiece and gives the examiner a highly magnified view but only of a very small portion of the fundus \u00ab 2% of the surface area). The indirect method uses a light source and an indirect ophthalmoscopy lens that is held in front of the eye, which gives the examiner a less magnified, but much larger field of view.\n\nAlthough the direct method is technically easier, it is not possible to examine the fundus adequately with the direct method because of the small field of view, so the indirect method is preferred. However, the indirect method is technically more difficult to perform because the image viewed, called a \"virtual image,\" is upside down and reversed. Thus, a lot of practice is required to become proficient at the indirect method.\n\nOphthalmoscopy should be a part of a complete eye exam in patients with ocular disease of any type, pupillary light reflex deficits, or vision loss. It should also be routinely performed in animals with undefined systemic illness or those with infectious, vascular, or neoplastic diseases, because many times these conditions affect the tissues of the fundus. 5. When I look at the fundus of a dog or a cat, how can I tell if it is normal or if a lesion is present?\n\nInterpreting the appearance of the fundus can be challenging and requires a basic understanding of the layers of the fundus (see question 1) and the normal variations (Fig. 1) . The most common variations of normal are those relating to the amount of pigment in the tissues of the fundus, the size and shape of the optic nerve, and the size and color of the tapetum. A good ophthalmology atlas helps in recognizing these normal variants, but mostly it requires experience and looking at a lot of normal animals.\n\n6. What are the most common types of funduscopic lesions?\n\nIn the tapetal area of the fundus (which is usually the dorsal one-third to one-half), lesions are characterized as being either hyporeflective if they are darker or grayer than the surrounding, normal tapetum or hyperreftective ifthey are brighter. These lesions correspond to either a thickening of the retina (hyporeflecti ve lesion -the thick retina blocks some ofthe light reflecting from the tapetum) or a thinning or degeneration of the retina (hyperreflective-the thin retina allows more reflected light off the tapetum). These identical lesions appear differently in the nontapetal fundus (ventral two-thirds to one-half) and appear as either a fluffy white lesion with indistinct margins (thickening of the retina) or a white to gray lesions with distinct margins (thinning, which is caused by loss of pigment in one of the retinal layers called the retinal pigment epithelium). Other common lesions include certain pigmented lesions and hemorrhage. Lesions are generally easier to visualize and understand in the tapetal fundus. 7. What is the significance of the hyporeftective lesion in the tapetum or the ftuffy white lesion in the nontapetum?\n\nThese two lesions are exactly the same; they just appear differently because they are being viewed against a different background (i.e., the tapetum versus pigmented background) and are caused by thickening of the retina (Figs. 2 and 3). The most common mechanisms by which the retina becomes thickened are:\n\n\u2022 Congenital thickening (retinal dysplasia) \u2022 Edema or inflammatory cells \u2022 Neoplastic cells 8. What is the significance of the hyperreftective lesions in the tapetum or the depigmented lesions in the nontapetal fundus?\n\nThese lesions are also analogous to each other and are caused by a thinning of the retina (Figs. 4 and 5). They are almost exclusively caused by atrophy or degeneration (this is the way the retina \n\n\"scars\" or responds to insult, because it can't undergo a regenerative repair like most other tissues). This degeneration may be caused by a number of different diseases with different mechanisms including inflammation, ischemia, malnutrition, or an inherited type of degeneration called progressive retinal atrophy. Focal lesions resulting from inflammation of the retina can be thought of as an inactive lesions. 9. What diseases should be considered if a hyporeflective lesion is seen in the fundus of a dog or a cat?\n\nRemember that if the lesion is not due to dysplasia, then thickening of the retina is due to inflammatory cells, neoplastic cells, or edema. Inflammation involving the retina is commonly caused by a systemic microbial infection and less commonly by trauma or an immune-mediated inflammation or hypersensitivity. Any systemic infection has the capability of affecting the fundus in this way. When the retina is the primary tissue affected, this is referred to as a retinitis or retinochoroiditis, and when the choroid is the predominate tissue affected, it is called a chorioretinitis. It is useful to think about the different microbial agents in broad categories that include:\n\nBacterial Fungal Protozoal Rickettsial Viral These hyporeflective lesions can also be caused by edema alone (with cells). When this occurs, the vascular system of the fundus is pathologically affected and leaks fluid into the retina. This often results from:\n\n\u2022 Systemic hypertension \u2022 Disease causing hyperviscosity syndrome (e.g., multiple myeloma or ehrlichiosis) \u2022 Profound anemia and hypoxia of the vessels Lastly, the hyporeflective lesions can be caused by neoplastic cells. The most common type of neoplasia affecting the fundus in this manner is lymphosarcoma. However, any malignant neoplasia is capable of metastasizing to the tissue of the fundus, and this should also be considered.\n\nDysplasia affects certain breeds of dogs. American cocker spaniels, English springer spaniels, King Charles spaniels, Labrador retrievers, and beagles are some of the common breeds, but there are many others. Dysplasia is generally bilateral and does not change in appearance over time. Dysplastic thickening of the retina often produces focal or multifocallinear lesions, whereas inflammation tends to cause multifocal circular lesions. If there is a systemic disease present that might cause inflammation, neoplastic infiltrate, or vascular insult to the retina, the hyporeflective lesion probably is not dysplasia. (See Chapter 40.) 11. If dysplasia is ruled out as the cause of a hyporefiective lesion, what should be done next?\n\nBecause there really are very few distinguishing or pathognomonic features of the different diseases that cause these lesions, the diagnosis cannot be made by ophthalmoscopy alone. The ocular exam has simply provided a clue that a systemic disease process is occurring. Therefore, follow the normal diagnostic steps including a thorough physical examination and a differential diagnosis list and perform the appropriate diagnostic tests to confirm or rule out these differentials.\n\nThese lesions are caused by atrophy or degeneration of the sensory retina. Characterize the lesions as focal (or multifocal) or more diffuse. Causes of diffuse hyperreflectivity include:\n\n\u2022 Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), an inherited retinal degeneration occurring mostly in pure-bred dogs \u2022 Sudden acquired retinal degeneration (SARD), an idiopathic retinal degeneration affecting mostly older, female, pure-bred dogs. Note that the fundus initially will appear normal with acute SARD; only after several weeks to months will the hyperreflectivity appear. \u2022 Diffuse retinitis or diffuse vascular insult that has resolved \u2022 Rarely, nutritional deficiencies such as chronic taurine deficiency in cats or vitamin E deficiency in dogs Focal or multifocal hyperreflective lesions are most commonly caused by either an inflammation or a vascular insult that has now resolved, causing a scarring of the retina. As with hyporeflective lesions, there is no pathognomonic appearance to these lesions suggesting one specific type of disease. In fact, these types of multifocal, degenerative lesions are often incidental findings and do not require any diagnostic evaluation (because the insult by which they were caused has already resolved).\n\nAs with most fundus lesions, there is nothing specific about the presence of a hemorrhage, and both ocular and systemic diseases can cause this (Fig. 6) . Examples of ocular disease that cause funduscopic hemorrhage include:\n\n\u2022 Inflammation (chorioretinitis) -look for the other lesions of this syndrome \u2022 Trauma \u2022 Retinal detachment \u2022 Developmental disorders such as persistence of the hyaloid artery system Systemic diseases that cause fundus hemorrhage are the same conditions causing bleeding anywhere else in the body:\n\n\u2022 Hypertension \u2022 Coagulopathies such as clotting disorders, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia \u2022 Profound anemia (from hypoxia of the retinal blood vessels) Thus, once again, the funduscopic findings often characterize the ocular condition or indicate that a systemic bleeding tendency is present. Proceed with the appropriate diagnostic evaluation based on ocular and physical examination findings. 14. What if, instead of a hyporeflective lesion, a darker lesion that looks like melanin or some other pigment is seen? What can cause this?\n\nHyporeflective lesions, which generally have a grayish appearance, are distinguished from pigmented lesions, which have a dark brown to black color. There are several mechanisms by which melanin or other types of pigment may become deposited in the tissues of the fundus. Most commonly, this is seen with focal or multifocal retinal and choroidal degeneration or atrophy. This results from damage to the tapetum or proliferation of pigment by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) following inflammation or vascular insult. Typically, these lesions would be chronic and \"inactive,\" with no current inflammation. For example, a pigmented center is often seen in hyperreflective lesions from these mechanisms. Also, pigment clumps are often seen in depigmented, inactive lesions in the nontapetal fundus.\n\nAlthough very rare, melanomas arising from the choroid can cause pigmented, raised lesions in the fundus. These would progress slowly over time and are generally considered benign in dogs.\n\nRemember that patchy clumps of pigment in the tapetal fundus can be a normal finding, caused by focal areas where the tapetum did not develop. Therefore, look for other lesions such as the appearance of hyperreflectivity or depigmentation before considering the pigment abnormal.\n\nRarely, other types of pigment besides melanin may be deposited in the retina. For example, systemic vitamin E deficiency in dogs may cause an accumulation of lipofuscin, a golden-brown pigment, in the RPE.\n\nRetinal detachment is actually a separation of two layers of the retina: the sensory retina and the RPE, rather than a separation of the retina from the underlying choroid. Fluid accumulates in the potential space between these two layers of the retina, referred to as the subretinal space.\n\n16. What causes a retina to detach?\n\n1. Exudative detachment is caused by edema or cells effusing into the subretinal space. This is generally caused by inflammation in the choroid (or a chorioretinitis) or a profound vascular insult to the retinal or choroidal vessels (e.g., severe systemic hypertension).\n\n2. Rhegmatogenoos detachment results from a tear in the retina, usually peripherally, that allows liquefied vitreous to leak through the tear and into the subretinal space. This tear often is created by pathologic changes in the vitreous. Vitreal changes can occur with aging, from cataracts and other lens diseases, and following intraocular surgery.\n\n3. Tractional retinal detachment results from blood or fibrin clots (or rarely from anomalous vessels) in the vitreous that are attached to the retinal surface. As the clot retracts, it pulls the retina, creating a detachment. Often, the traction also creates a tear that causes a rhegmatogenous detachment. Tractional detachments are uncommon in veterinary patients.\n\nBecause fluid collects in the subretinal space and in front of the tapetum (or the pigmented RPE for the nontapetum), retinal detachments often appear as large areas of hyporeflectivity in the tapetal fundus or as whitish, indistinct areas in the nontapetal fundus (Fig. 7) . Hemorrhage in the retina or even in the vitreous also can be seen, and occasionally this hemorrhage will migrate anteriorly into the anterior chamber, producing hyphema. Because the retina is displaced forward into the vitreous, the surface is out of focus to the ophthalmoscopic lens and observer and appears fuzzy and indistinct. If the retina if detached forward to a great extent, the retinal blood vessels may be seen clearly and in focus without the use of an ophthalmoscope, simply by looking through the pupil with a focal light source. 18. Is there any treatment for a retinal detachment? Can the eye regain vision?\n\nThe specific treatment and prognosis for retinal detachment depend largely on the mechanism (exudative versus rhegmatogenous) and duration of the detachment. Exudative detachments are managed by treating the specific disease process (i.e., antimicrobial agents if infectious inflammation; anti-inflammatory agents if traumatic or immune-mediated inflammation; antihypertensive agents if systemic hypertension is the cause). Rhegmatogenous detachments must be treated surgically by sealing the tear, generally with laser or cryoprobe and various other adjuvant surgical techniques. The eye has an effective mechanism to pump the subretinal fluid out, so if the underlying problem is corrected, retinal reattachment and recovery of some vision are possible. However, because the retina becomes ischemic, retinal detachment of > I week duration is unlikely to become functional again. Unfortunately, most retinal detachments in animals are not recognized in a timely fashion, and the visual prognosis is relatively poor (see Chapter 42)."}
