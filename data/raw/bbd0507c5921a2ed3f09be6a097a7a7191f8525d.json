After isolation of preinitiation complexes, the reactions were divided into two aliquots, and RNA synthesis reaction was performed either in the absence (lanes 1-4) or the presence (lanes 5-8) of 100 g/ml puromycin. The products of the reaction were analyzed by native 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. more detail the requirements for this reaction. Since represents the time required to increase the length of the poly(A) before replication can start.

Transcripts with only 12 adenylates at their 3\u0408 ends are less efficient at producing their ability to replicate in 293 cells. All constructs contained 3\u0408-dA at their 3\u0408 end to block potential extension negative stranded RNA in vitro than those with 80. To confirm and expand these results, we engineered polio-of the poly(A) tail. After transfection, cells were incubated at 37\u040aC in the presence or absence of 2 mM GuHCl virus replicon RNAs containing a defined number of adenylate residues-A0, A4, A8, A12, or A16-at their 3\u0408 to distinguish between direct translation of the input RNA and translation of amplified RNA.

In the presence of GuHCl, luciferase activity produced by RNAs the course of replication, transcripts could regain long poly(A) tails by addition of adenylates at the 3\u0408 OH. To with shorter poly(A) tails (A1-H, A5-H) was only two to three times lower than that produced by long poly(A) prevent this possibility, we also generated transcripts rib(\u03e9)RLuc-A1-H to rib(\u03e9)RLuc-A17-H with blocked 3\u0408 tail constructs (A9-H, A13-H, and A17-H) ( Figure 2D ). In the absence of GuHCl, only those constructs with more ends via incorporation of a single 3\u0408 deoxyadenosine (3\u0408-dA), which cannot accept additional nucleotides. \n\nRNAs with 0, 4, 8, 12, or 16 adenylate residues at their 3\u0408 ends were used to program an in vitro translation/replication extract.

We first determined the affinity of ment for negative strand RNA synthesis in vitro and in vivo. A minimum length of 8 to 12 adenylate residues is recombinant PABP1-H6 for poly(A) using a poliovirus 3\u0408 UTR with a poly(A) tail of 80 nucleotides ( Figure 3A) . The sufficient to support efficient initiation of RNA synthesis. apparent K d was \u202b04\u0641\u202c nM, which is higher than reported for PABP1 purified from eukaryotic cells ( In conclusion, we observed a close correlation between the affinity of PABP1-H6 for the poly(A) tail and the initiation of negative strand RNA synthesis in vitro; constructs with longer poly(A) tails (A12 and A16) interact with PABP1-H6 with higher affinity and initiate negative strand synthesis more efficiently (compare Figures  2E and 3B ) than do replicons with shorter poly(A) tails.\n\nAs mentioned before, it has been shown that the C-terminal part of PABP1 interacts with PCBP (Wang et al., 1999). Since PCBP is a known RNA binding protein that binds to the cloverleaf domain of the poliovirus 5\u0408 UTR, we reasoned that the 5\u0408 and 3\u0408 ends of the viral genome might interact with each other through a PABP1-PCBP interaction.\n\nFull-length PABP1-H6 and the N-terminal region of PABP, \u232cPABP-H6 (residues 1-190, containing RRM1/2), were expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography. As expected (Kuhn and Pieler, 1996), both recombinant proteins were able to bind to a poly(A)-Sepharose column ( Figure 4A, lanes 2 and 3) . To test whether proteins that bind to the poliovirus cloverleaf RNA can interact with PABP1, we incubated recombinant MBP-PCBP (PCBP2 fused to the maltose binding protein) or H6-3CD (His-tagged 3CD) with PABP1-H6 bound to poly(A)-Sepharose. Both MBP-PCBP and H6-3CD interacted with full-length PABP1-H6 ( Figure 4B , lanes 1 and 4) but did not interact with \u232cPABP-H6 or poly(A)-Sepharose alone ( Figure 4B, lanes 2, 3, 5, and  6) . Thus, PCBP and 3CD have the potential to associate with PABP1, presumably through interaction with the C-terminal part of PABP1.\n\nTo provide further evidence for the interaction of PABP1 with PCBP and 3CD, we performed mobility shift Figure 3B ). In contrast, PABP1-cloverleaf RNA ( Figure 4C, lanes 1-4) , and an excess of bovine serum albumin (BSA) did not induce the forma-H6 interacted with 3\u0408 UTR-8, 3\u0408 UTR-12, and 3\u0408 UTR-16 with high affinities. Apparent K d values were \u202b,002\u0641\u202c tion of the high-affinity complex ( Figure 4C, lanes 9-12) . Furthermore, the complex formed by only 3CD and \u202b,001\u0641\u202c and \u202b04\u0641\u202c nM, respectively ( Figure 3B ), indicating that a minimum of eight nucleotides are required for MBP-PCBP runs slightly faster than the complex formed by 3CD, MBP-PCBP, and PABP ( Figure 4D ). In summary, binding and that the affinity increases as a function of the poly(A) tail length. These results are consistent with these results indicate that PABP1 directly interacts with PCBP and 3CD, that the proteins can interact with each previously published observations indicating that the affinity of yeast PABP for poly(A) increases with increas-other while bound to their cognate RNAs, and that PABP1 can induce the formation of a stable complex ing length of oligo(A) up to 12 residues (Sachs et al., 1987) .\n\nat the 5\u0408 end of the genomic RNA. 1-5) .

These results are in accordance with previous findings (Joachims et al., 1999) and demonstrate that cleavage of PABP1 occurs only late in the RNA replication cycle.\n\nNegative stranded RNA synthesis is initiated at the 3\u0408 end of the genome of positive stranded RNA viruses. Depending on the virus group, two distinct RNA structures located at the 3\u0408 ends of these viruses have been proposed to participate in RNA replication: a poly(A) tail (e.g., in the picorna-, \u2423, corona-, or potexviruses) or a stable, often t-RNA-like secondary structure (e.g., in the flavi-and bromoviruses; reviewed by Buck, 1996). It has been shown for a few viruses that the length of the poly(A) tail is critical for efficient replication (Sarnow, 1989; Raju et al., 1999; Tsai et al., 1999; Spagnolo and Hogue, 2000) . However, if the poly(A) tail directly was the sole major determinant of initiation of negative strand RNA synthesis, it is difficult to understand how the viral replication apparatus discriminates between cellular mRNAs and the viral genomic RNA. In this study, we have provided evidence that the \n\nThe Ribonucleoprotein Complex Formed around the Cloverleaf RNA and Its Role in Negative for RNA synthesis, we examined the effect of recombinant \u232cPABP-H6 on translation and RNA synthesis using\n\nThe cloverleaf RNA appears to be involved in the synthe-the cell-free replication system.

These results implied that mutations within the cloverleaf abrogated positive strand lanes 4-6). In contrast, the addition of recombinant PABP1-H6 did not block replication ( Figure 5B , lanes RNA synthesis and/or stability (Andino et al., 1990a) . Recently, we have shown that the 3CD-cloverleaf inter-1-3). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that \u232cPABP acts as a dominant-negative mutant by dis-action downregulates translation to yield ribosome-free templates that could be replicated, thus implying that rupting the interaction of PABP1 with PCBP and/or 3CD and that this interaction is required for initiation of polio-the cloverleaf played a role in coordinating the use of the genomic RNA for translation or RNA replication (Ga-virus RNA synthesis.\n\nIt has been reported that PABP1 is proteolytically marnik and Andino, 1998). The experiments presented here suggest that the cloverleaf also plays an important cleaved during picornavirus infection by viral proteases (Joachims et al., 1999; Kerekatte et al., 1999) . We have direct role in negative strand RNA synthesis, as we have now shown that deletion of the entire cloverleaf results not yet determined whether proteolytically cleaved PABP1 is capable of supporting the initiation of negative in complete inhibition of negative strand RNA synthesis. More importantly, inhibition of translation with puromy-strand RNA synthesis. However, cleavage of PABP1 is not detectable until 4 hr postinfection, around the peak cin does not promote negative strand RNA synthesis of a cloverleaf-deficient genome ( Figure 1C ). of maximum RNA synthesis, and at 8 hr postinfection, when RNA synthesis has ceased, more than 30% of Since 3CD binds to the RNA through the 3C proteinase RNA binding domain (Andino et al., 1990b) , an additional PABP1 remains uncleaved in the infected cell (our un-a role homologous to that of the cloverleaf RNA in BVDV replication.\n\nOur results suggest that, in order to reach their site of action during initiation of negative strand RNA synthesis, proteins bound to the 5\u0408 cloverleaf interact with PABP1 bound to the 3\u0408 poly(A) tail, thus circularizing the genomic RNA. It has been previously shown that enzymatic removal of the poly(A) tail from virion RNA renders replication of these RNAs incompetent (Spector et al., 1975) , whereas translation was not affected. Indeed, our analysis of the minimal poly(A) length required for viral replication suggests that the high-affinity interaction of the poly(A) tail with PABP1 is more critical for efficient RNA replication than for IRES-dependent translation (although minor effects on translation have been observed in vivo; Figure 2D ). PABP1 is an important regulatory factor involved in the control of cellular mRNA stability and translation (reviewed by Sachs and Wahle, 1993; Sachs et al., 1997) . It has been shown that PABP1 interacts with the translation initiation factor eIF4G (reviewed by Gingras et al., 1999) , and because eIF4G forms a complex with the cap-recognizing eIF4E, this interaction probably leads to the effective circularization of cellular mRNAs ( Figure 6A ). Using purified homologous yeast proteins, this circularization has been recently visualized with atomic force microscopy (Wells et al., 1998) .\n\nFor poliovirus RNA, circularization also appears to be mediated by PABP1, but in this case PABP1 interacts with PCBP and viral 3CD bound to the 5\u0408 end of the RNA ( Figure 6B ). PCBP is a known component of an RNP complex that forms within the 3\u0408 UTR of the human \u2423-globin mRNA and determines its stability (Kiledjian et al., 1995). Within that complex, PCBP has been shown \n\nThe generation of the 5\u0408-terminal cloverleaf RNA probe has been The following plasmids were used to transcribe luciferase-expressdescribed earlier (Andino et al., 1990a) .
