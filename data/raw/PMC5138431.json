{"title": "Detection of kobuvirus RNA in Japanese domestic dogs", "body": "An epidemic outbreak of gastroenteritis in humans, possibly caused by consumption of raw\noysters, occurred in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, in 1989, after which a small round virus was\nisolated from the feces of affected patients. Based on nucleotide and amino acid sequence\nanalyses, the causal virus was classified as a new genus (the genus\nkobuvirus) in the family Picornaviridae and named the Aichi\nvirus [30, 31].\nKobuviruses are non-enveloped, single-stranded and positive-sense RNA viruses, and have been\nisolated from samples obtained from a variety of mammals. Genetically, it is classified into\nthree strains, termed Aichivirus A (formerly Aichi virus), B (formerly bovine kobuvirus) and C\n(formerly porcine kobuvirus) [6, 7, 13, 15, 16, 21, 22, 24, 29].\n\nIn 2011, Kapoor et al. [13] reported\na virus related to the Aichi virus obtained from dog feces in the United States, which was the\nfirst report of its kind to suggest canine kobuvirus infection and was termed canine kobuvirus\n(CaKoV). CaKoV is classified as Aichivirus A species together with the Aichi virus, as well as\nkobuviruses isolated from cats and mice [7, 14]. Later, CaKoV was reported to be isolated from dogs in\nItaly, the United Kingdom, Korea, China and Tanzania [2,\n4, 5, 10]. Furthermore, gene analysis showed the presence of\nviruses very closely related to CaKoV in canidae animals, such as jackal and fox, and the\nHyaenidae [8, 18].\n\nIn Japan, viruses similar to CaKoV have been detected in abundance together with the Aichi\nvirus in sludge from wastewater treatment plants, suggesting the presence of CaKoV [28]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no\nreports of CaKoV detection in Japanese dogs.\n\nFor the purpose of determining evidence for the circulation of CaKoV among domestic dogs in\nJapan, we attempted to isolate the CaKoV gene from fecal samples of household dogs and dogs\nbeing kept in pet shops.\n\nIn the period from 2012 to 2015, fecal samples were collected from a total of 94 household\n(privately owned) dogs with diarrhea (37, 6, 25 and 26 samples in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015,\nrespectively), which visited veterinary clinics nationwide in Japan, in which the involvement\nof CPV-2 infection was ruled out by PCR (mentioned later). Furthermore, the fecal samples\nobtained from 50 clinically healthy kenneled dogs, aged 1\u20133 months, were collected from 4 pet\nshops in Japan. The sample was suspended in a sterile saline, the suspension was centrifuged,\nand nucleic acid was isolated from the supernatant using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen\nscience, Germantown, MD, U.S.A.), following the manufacturer\u2019s instruction. The extract was\npreserved at \u221245\u00b0C until used.\n\nCaKoV was detected by RT-PCR with a primer pair (Forward; 5\u2032-CTCCCCTCAGCTGCCTTCTC-3, Reverse;\n5\u2032-GAGGATCTGAAATTTGGAAG-3\u2032) that was amplified at nucleotide positions 7,368\u20137,619 (a partial\n3D gene) of CaKoV 12D049 (KF924623) [4], providing a\n252-bp fragment, using a QIAGEN One Step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen science). Two point five\n\u00b5l of the extracted RNA was added to the 25 \u00b5l reaction\nmixtures containing 5 \u00b5l of 5 \u00d7buffer (finally 1.5 mM MgCl2), 0.4\nmM of each deoxynucleozide triphosphate, 10 U RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A.),\n0.8 \u00b5M of the primers and 1.0 \u00b5l of enzyme mix. The RNA was\nreverse transcribed at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by inactivation of reverse transcriptase and\ndenaturation of cDNA template at 95\u00b0C for 15 min. The cDNA was amplified in 35 sequential\ncycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, annealing at 52\u00b0C for 30 sec and extension at 72\u00b0C\nfor 40 sec, followed by a final extension of 72\u00b0C for 7 min. The PCR product was\nelectrophoresed at 100 V for 35 min in a 2% agarose gel. Then, the gel was stained with\nethidium bromide and was visualized under UV illumination.\n\nFurthermore, 12 samples positive for the above mentioned RT-PCR were also submitted to RT-PCR\nwith a primer pair which was amplified at nucleotide positions 6,982\u20137,485 (3D gene) of CaKoV\n12D049 (KF924623) (Forward; 5\u2032-CCCTGGAACACCCAAGGCCGCT-3\u2032, Reverse; 5\u2032-\nTCTGGTTGCCATAGATGTGGTG-3\u2032) [5]. These PCR amplicons\n(504-bp) and above amplicons (252-bp) were purified using ExoSAP-IT and were submitted to\ndirect sequencing on both strands by the dye-terminator cycle sequencing methodology (Bio\nMatrix Research, Chiba, Japan). The sequences (Nucleotide positions 6,982\u20137,619; 638-bp) were\naligned with the reference strains in the GenBank Database using MEGA 6 software [27]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed employing the\nneighbor-joining method [23], and their homologies were\nanalyzed using the BLAST search.\n\nTo investigate the involvement of other diarrheagenic viruses in the RT-PCR positive samples,\ncanine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) [1], canine coronavirus\ntypes I (CCoV-I) and II (CCoV-II) [20], canine\ndistemper virus (CDV) [9], canine adenovirus type 1\n(CAdV-1) [12] and canine rotavirus (CRV) [11] were examined by PCR or RT-PCR.\n\nThe RT-PCR products (252-bp) were detected in 35 diarrheal household dogs (37.2%) and 24\nhealthy kenneled dogs (48.0%), with no significant differences (P>0.05).\nAs shown in Table 1, grouped by age, the positivity of the RT-PCR in dogs, aged 2 months, was\nextremely high (63.9%) and was significantly different from the averaged positivity (37.2%)\n(P=0.0062, chi-squared=7.4845). In contrast, no positive PCR reaction was\nobserved in all of 24 dogs aged 5 months or over. In addition, all the RT-PCR positive dogs\nwere purebreds (Table 1). No significant\ndifferences were observed, grouped by year and region of Japan (P>0.05)\n(data not shown).\n\nWhen the 35 RT-PCR positive samples of the diarrheal household dogs were examined for other\ndiarrheagenic viruses, CCoV-I, CCoV-II and CDV were detected in 21, 15 and 5 samples,\nrespectively, while CAdV-1 and CRV were not detected. None of these 5 viruses were detected in\n7 samples (20.0%) (data not shown).\n\nThe partial 3D nucleotide sequences (638-bp) of the 12 present strains were compared with the\nreference strains in the GenBank database. Among the present strains, the homologies were\n95.7\u201398.9%. The homologies of the present strains with known CaKoVs from dogs and canidae\nanimals, and the Kobuvirus detected from a sewage sample (AB861494) were 94.5\u201397.4% and\n96.1\u201397.7%, respectively. The present strains were clustered into the same clade with the\nknown CaKoVs and the sewage strain in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1). The homologies of the present strains with the isolates from humans, cats and mice\nwere relatively high (77.4\u201383.3%), showing that the present strains were classified into\nAichivirus A species. In contrast, those with the isolates from other mammals were low\n(60.8\u201366.5%), which were clustered in different clades. Furthermore, the present strains and\nthe sewage virus were clustered into the same clade (Asia), if the CaKoV clade was\nsubdivided.\n\nIn the present study, kobuvirus RNA was detected at a high rate in the dog fecal samples. As\na result of 3D nucleotide sequence analysis, it was revealed that the virus had a very high\nhomology with previously reported CaKoV, suggesting that CaKoV has been transmitted among\nJapanese dogs. Generally, infectious viral diseases tend to be epidemic during the juvenile\nperiod [25, 26,\n32], and we observed a similar tendency for CaKoV in\nthe present study. Surprisingly, however, the frequency of viral RNA detection was confined in\nthe dogs four months old or younger and was never found in those older than five months. These\nfindings indicate that dogs have a strong age-dependent resistance to CaKoV and that the dog\ninfected with CaKoV in the past has a high resistance to reinfection. Unfortunately, since the\nkenneled dogs of this study were aged 1\u20133 months, the positivity could not be analyzed by age.\nFurthermore, our findings showed a high rate of detection of viral RNA in kennels, similar to\nthe finding of Choi et al. [4]. Thus,\nwe speculated that CaKoV prevalence is confined to multi-dog environments.\n\nYamashita et al. [28] isolated a\nlarge amount of viral RNA similar to that of CaKoV from sludge obtained from a wastewater\ntreatment plant. We found that the sewage virus had a very high homology with CaKoV detected\nin the dogs of the present study, indicating a possible canine origin. As noted above, CaKoV\ntends to be epidemic in an environment where several dogs are kept together. However, the risk\nof CaKoV infection even in a dog-free environment is understandable, since picornaviruses are\nhighly stable in a normal environment.\n\nPhylogenetic tree analysis of the 3D region showed that the viral strains isolated in Japan\nincluding CaKoV from sewage sludge could be classified into the same clade as those found in\ncountries neighboring Japan, such as Korea and China, but into a different clade as compared\nto those isolated in Europe, the United States and Africa, if subdivided. Thus, CaKoV may be\nspecific to various countries and regions, and may show independent transmission.\n\nThe diarrheal pathogenicity of CaKoV in dogs has not been fully elucidated, and it is still\nnot clear whether CaKoV is diarrheagenic. [2, 5, 17]. Based on\nresults of the present study showing that viral RNA was detected in approximately half of the\nexamined healthy kenneled dogs, we suggest that it may not be a primary pathogen in dogs.\nHowever, all of the diarrheal dogs were found not to be infected with CPV-2, the most\nimportant diarrheal pathogen. Furthermore, 20.0% of the CaKoV-positive dogs were negative for\nother major diarrhea causative viruses, such as CDV, CAdV-1, CCoV and CRV. Recent\nepidemiological studies suggested possible involvement of porcine kobuvirus in diarrheal\ndisease seen in piglets [3, 19]. Thus, it is possible that CaKoV might be involved in diarrheal disease\nseen in dogs as a mild or secondary infection factor, though various factors other than these\nviral infections can be related to an episode of diarrheal disease.\n\nFurther detailed epidemiological investigations including rearing environments and symptoms,\nas well as experimental infections, are considered necessary to clarify the pathogenicity of\nCaKoV."}
