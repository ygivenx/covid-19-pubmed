{"title": "Prevalence of canine coronavirus antibodies by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in dogs in the south of Italy", "body": "Coronaviruses are large viruses that cause respiratory, enteric and generalised disease in humans and domestic animals. Canine coronavirus (CCoV) belongs to one of the major antigenic groups of coronaviruses (Siddell et al., 1983; Spaan et al., 1988) and is related serologically and genetically to transmissible gastroenteritis virus of pigs, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) and human coronavirus 229E (HcoV-229E) (Sanchez et al., 1990; Horsburgh et al., 1992; Wesseling et al., 1994) . The viruses have enveloped virions containing a nonsegmented, positive plus-stranded RNA genome that is 27-32 kb in length (Siddell, 1995) and is packaged by the nucleoprotein N (43 kDa) into a helical nucleocapsid. The ribonucleoprotein is surrounded by a lipid envelope which contains three viral glycoproteins: the spike S glycoprotein forming the long club-shaped surface projections on the virion surface, the integral M glycoprotein (29 kDa) and the small membrane (E) protein (9 kDa).\n\nCCoV was first isolated from faecal specimens of American military dogs with diarrhoeal disease (Binn et al., 1974) . CCoV infects dogs of any breed or age, causing depression, anorexia, vomiting and diarrhoea in young animals. The dogs generally recover spontaneously 7-10 days after infection, but the diarrhoea may persist for more than 2 weeks. Death may occur 1-3 days after the onset of disease, especially in young pups (Carmichael and Binn, 1981) .\n\nDefinitive identification of CCoV-induced disease may be achieved by detection of CCoV shed in faeces at electron microscopy or by virus isolation in cell culture. The common presence of coronavirus-like particles in faeces makes the diagnosis of CCoV by electron microscopy arduous and requires confirmation by other diagnostic methods (Athanssious et al., 1994) . On the other hand, many investigators have experienced difficulties in cultivating coronaviruses in vitro (De Groot and Horzinek, 1995; Tennant et al., 1994; Pratelli et al., 1999 Pratelli et al., , 2000 Wesley, 1999) .\n\nRecently, nested PCR assay (n-PCR) for the detection of CCoV with primers to the transmembrane protein M gene, has been described (Pratelli et al., 1999) .\n\nAssessment of antibodies by the virus neutralisation assay (Mochizuki et al., 1987) , or by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Rimmelzwaan et al., 1991; Tuchiya et al., 1991) provides an indication of the exposure of an animal to CCoV. Detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG against CCoV by indirect ELISA (Tennant et al., 1991; Naylor et al., 2001) determines current or previous exposure of an animal to CCoV.\n\nThe aim of this study was to improve the detection of CCoV-specific antibodies in canine sera, by using an Elisa that was compared to the virus neutralisation test and Western blotting assay.\n\nCrandell feline kidney (CrFK) cells were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum.\n\nA cell culture adapted CCoV strain 45/93, isolated from a dog with enteritis (Buonavoglia et al., 1994) , was used throughout this study.\n\nA total of 109 serum samples, collected from dogs of the Small Animal Clinic, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Bari, Italy, were employed.\n\nThe supernatants of CrFK cell cultures infected with CCoV strain 45/93, or mock infected cultures, were harvested 96 h postinfection and clarified at 3000\u00d7g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. Subsequently, the supernatants were centrifuged for 1 h at 140000\u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C.\n\nThe pellets were resuspended in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) at 1/80 the initial volume and used as positive and negative antigens for Elisa and Western blotting tests.\n\nSerial twofold dilutions starting from 1/2 of each sample were mixed with 100 TCID 50 of CCoV 45/93 strain in 96-well microtitre plates. The plates were kept at room temperature for 90 min and then 20000 CrFK cells were added to each well. The plates were read after 4 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C when the cytopathic effect was complete in the virus control cultures. The titre was expressed as the highest serum dilution neutralizing the virus.\n\nMicrotitre plates (Costar) were coated with 100 ml per well of antigen diluted in carbonate buffer (15 mM Na 2 CO 3 , 35 mM NaHCO 3 , [pH 9.6]) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with shaking. The plates were washed four times in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T), then treated with blocking solution (0.2% gelatin in carbonate buffer) for 90 min at 37\u00b0C and washed four times with PBS-T. Dilutions of 1/50 in PBS-T of each canine serum were added in duplicate and the plates were incubated for 90 min at 37\u00b0C.\n\nThe washing cycle described above was then repeated and 100 ml of peroxidase-conjugated caprine IgG, specific for canine IgG (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO), diluted in PBS-T were added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After another washing cycle, 100 ml of freshly prepared substrate were placed in each well. The solution consisted of 10 mg 2,2%azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate] diammonium salt (ABTS, Sigma) in 50 ml 0.05 M phosphate citrate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 25 ml/100 ml hydrogen peroxide and the optical densities at 405 nm (OD 405) were determined.\n\nThe adjusted OD values of each sample were obtained by subtracting the absorbance of the mock antigen-coated well from that of the corresponding virus antigen-coated well.\n\nThe antigen preparations diluted 1:1 in Laemmli sample buffer were heated at 95\u00b0C\u00d7 4 min, subjected to electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-polyacrylamide minigel (5-20%) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Immobilon P, pore size 0.45 mm) with a BIORAD Transblot Cell apparatus at 70 V for 2 h.\n\nNon-specific binding sites were blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C with 5% non-fat dry milk (Blotting Grade Blocker, Biorad) in Tris Buffered Saline (TBS; Tris 25 mM, NaCl 200 mM, pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-TM).\n\nAll the subsequent steps were conducted with shaking at room temperature.\n\nAfter washing three times with TBS Tween 20 (TBS-T), the membrane was probed with canine serum samples diluted 1:100 in TBS-TM for 2 h. The membrane was then washed three times with TBS-T (5 min per wash) and incubated for 2 h with peroxidase labeled caprine IgG specific for canine IgG (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO).\n\nAfter being washed extensively in TBS-T, DAB (3,3%-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride [Sigma] in TBS [pH 7.8], 0.08% hydrogen peroxide) was used in the chromogenic reaction.\n\nA total of 29 of the 109 samples examined were negative by the virus neutralisation test and were examined subsequently by Western blotting. Ten of these sera were found concomitantly to be free of CCoV specific antibodies and used to adjust the Elisa cut-off value (three Standard Deviations higher than the arithmetic mean of the absorbance of concordantly negative samples). Samples with value exceeding than 0.040 were considered to be positive.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1A , 80 of the 109 serum samples proved to be positive at the virus neutralisation test.\n\nNineteen samples, which were found to be free of CCoV neutralising antibodies, gave a positive signal by the Elisa. In 17 of these, CCoV specific antibodies were also found by the Western blotting test. These sera, therefore, were recorded as positive concomitantly by Elisa (Fig. 1B) .\n\nTwo discrepant sera remained which gave a positive result exclusively by Elisa.\n\nWith the Western blotting test, most serum samples showed reactivity to the N and M proteins of CCoV and only a few samples also reacted against the S protein (data not shown). Considering virus neutralisation as a 'gold standard' test, Elisa had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 34.5%, with an overall agreement of 82.6%. However, when the virus neutralisation test combined with the confirmatory Western blotting test, were used as the 'gold standard', the Elisa showed an improved specificity (83.3%), while the sensitivity remained unchanged (100%), with an overall agreement of 98.2%.\n\nIn this study an Elisa was developed to detect CCoV-specific antibodies. To determine whether the Elisa could be used for this purpose, sensitivity and specificity were evaluated, considering the virus neutralisation test and the virus neutralisation combined with Western blotting tests as 'gold standards'.\n\nOut of 109 sera, 19 false-positives and no falsenegative samples were detected initially with the Elisa, using virus neutralisation as the standard test. In 17/19 of the false-positive samples, however, CCoV antibodies were also detected by Western blotting and these samples were thus considered to be positive.\n\nThree of the samples, which were negative only by the virus neutralisation test, yielded consistently high OD values by Elisa; this apparently strange result is not easy to explain, but since Western blotting showed both specific and nonspecific reactivity for the same samples (cellular antigens?), this may account for the high Elisa OD values.\n\nRecently, CCoV infection has attracted scientific interest especially concerning the pathogenesis of infection in dog (Bandai et al., 1999; Naylor et al., 2001) , viral genome variability (Pratelli et al., 2001) and the development of rapid and sensitive diagnostic tests (Pratelli et al., 1999; Bandai et al., 1999; Naylor et al., 2001) . Routine measurements of CCoV-specific antibodies are still based on the virus neutralisation test, which is costly as well as time-consuming (at least 4 days) and requires specialised laboratories. We carried out a preliminary comparison of the virus neutralisation and the Elisa and the findings clearly revealed a discrepancy between the results of the two tests, especially in evaluating CCoV seronegativity: 17 out of the 29 samples that were negative in virus neutralisation and positive at Elisa were confirmed to be positive by the Western blotting.\n\nAntibody determination by different methods does not necessarily give parallel results. Whereas, Elisa and Western blotting are able to detect antibodies to all major viral proteins, the virus neutralisation test only measures the neutralising antibodies and, as a result, may lack sensitivity.\n\nThe lower sensitivity of the virus neutralisation test for detecting the antibodies induced by CCoV, may provide misleading information on the epidemiological features of the infection. Above all, the virus neutralisation test may impede evaluation of the pre-existing immunological status of the dogs used in pathogenesis studies or in immunogenicity/potency trials on the vaccines employed for immunisation of dogs against CCoV infection. Because of its advantages, such as rapidity and greater sensitivity, the Elisa described may be considered more attractive than the virus neutralisation test and prove a useful tool for the serological diagnosis of CCoV infection."}
