{"title": "Interferon-\u03b12b and ribavirin treatment improves outcome in MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques", "body": "All infectious work with MERS-CoV was approved by the RML Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and performed in a high containment facility at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML), Division of Intramural Research (DIR), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH). IBC approved standard operating procedures were applied for all infectious work.\n\nVero cells (African green monkey kidney) were maintained at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 \u03bcg/ml of streptomycin. MERS-CoV (isolate hCoV-EMC/2012)8 was subsequently propagated on Vero cells using DMEM as above with 2% FBS (complete DMEM).\n\nAll animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Rocky Mountain Laboratories and performed following the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the guidelines of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International (AAALAC) by certified staff in an AAALAC approved facility. We inoculated six healthy rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), aged 4-6 years, with a total of 7 \u00d7 106 TCID50 of MERS-CoV by combined intratracheal, intranasal, oral and ocular routes as previously established 33,2. Animals were randomly assigned to either the treated or untreated group in a non-blinded manner.\n\nTreatment was initiated at 8 h post-infection. The initial ribavirin (MP Bioscience) loading dose (30 mg/kg) was delivered intravenously; subsequent doses (10 mg/kg) were delivered every 8 h intramuscularly. Interferon-\u03b12b, as IntronA (Merck) (5 MIU/kg) was delivered subcutaneously every 16 h. Three animals received IFN-\u03b12b and ribavirin (treated), while three animals received sham treatment (untreated) by the same routes with a comparable volume/kg of sterile saline. The animals were monitored three times daily through clinical scoring and/or examinations as described previously32. Clinical examinations included daily ventral-dorsal and lateral x-rays, body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, pulse oximetry, venous bleeding, bronchoalveolar lavage and collection of swabs from nasal and oral mucosa. A board-certified veterinarian interpreted the radiographic data. On 3 dpi all animals were necropsied and conjunctiva, nasal mucosa, tonsil, oronasopharynx, mandibular lymph node, salivary gland, trachea, right bronchus, left bronchus, all six lung lobes, mediastinal lymph node, inguinal lymph node, axillary lymph node, mesenteric lymph node heart, liver, spleen, kidney and urinary bladder were collected for virological and histopathological assays.\n\nHematological analysis was carried out following standard protocols. The total white blood cell count, lymphocyte, platelet, reticulocyte, and red blood cell counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit values, mean cell volume, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentrations were determined from EDTA blood with the HemaVet 950FS+ laser-based hematology analyzer (Drew Scientific).\n\nSamples from all lung lobes were weighed and subsequently homogenized in 400 \u03bcl of Bio-Plex cell lysis buffer (BioRad) with a stainless steel bead on the Qiashredder (Qiagen). Debris was pelleted and the supernatant removed. Both serum and tissue samples were inactivated with 5 MRads \u03b3-radiation according to standard operating procedures. The total protein concentration in the tissue homogenate was determined with the DC Protein Assay (BioRad) and used to normalize the input. Concentrations of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12/23 (p40), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, MCP-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, soluble CD40-ligand (sCD40L), transforming growth factor(TGF)-\u03b1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and IL-18 were measured on a Bio-Plex 200 instrument (Bio-Rad) using the Non-Human Primate Cytokine MILLIPLEX map 23-plex kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Levels of interferon-\u03b1 in the serum were determined with the VeriKine human interferon-\u03b1 ELISA kit (PBL, Piscataway, NJ) according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\nTissues were placed in cassettes and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 7 days. Subsequently, tissues were processed with a Sakura VIP-5 Tissue Tek, on a 12 h automated schedule, using a graded series of ethanol, xylene, and ParaPlast Extra. Embedded tissues were sectioned at 5 \u03bcm and dried overnight at 42\u00b0C prior to staining. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). Specific anti-CoV immunoreactivity was detected using a polyclonal rabbit antibody against hCoV-EMC/2012 at a 1:1000 dilution. Tissues were also stained with a myeloperoxidase-specific antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The tissues were then processed for immunohistochemistry using the Discovery XT automated processor (Ventana Medical Systems) with a DAPMap (Ventana Medical Systems) kit., scanned with the Aperio ScanScope XT (Aperio Technologies, Inc.) and the entire section analyzed with the ImageScope Positive Pixel Count algorithm (version 9.1).\n\nRNA from AVL-treated blood and RLT-treated tissues were extracted with the QiaAmp Viral RNA and the RNeasy kits, respectively (Qiagen). qRT-PCR using primers and probe previously described19 were performed on the RotorGene Q (Qiagen). A 10-fold dilution series of viral RNA based on TCID50 equivalents was used as a standard. For microarray analysis lung homogenates were stored at \u201380\u00b0 C in equal volumes RLT buffer (Qiagen) and 70% ethanol until preparation. Samples were thawed and two additional volumes of RLT buffer with 0.01 volumes of 2-mercaptoethanol were added, followed by an additional two volumes of 70% ethanol. RNA was then extracted using RNeasy spin columns per the manufacturer's protocol. Low yield samples were concentrated using the RNA Clean and Concentrator (Zymo Research). Probe labeling was carried out using the Agilent Low Input processing protocol, and hybridized to Agilent Rhesus macaque 4\u00d744K microarrays (Agilent Technologies) using the manufacturer's one-color analysis protocol.\n\nFor comparisons of differentially expressed genes (DEG) in infected lungs of both interferon-\u03b12b and ribavirin-treated and untreated animals, raw array data was uploaded to Genedata Analyst 7.6 (Genedata). Data was normalized using the quantile normalization method, and the log10 ratio expression was calculated relative to the mean probe values of the three untreated animals. Statistically significant DEG were determined using Welch's t-test (p<0.01, fold change \u2265 1.5). Hierarchical clustering of DEG was performed by the unweighted average method (Unweighted Pair Group with Arithmetic Mean; UPGMA) using Spotfire DecisionSite 9.1.1 (Tibco). Analysis of functional enrichment was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (Ingenuity Systems).\n\nFor measures of gene expression dynamics, the array data were normalized using NeONORM34 and subjected to SVD-MDS analysis35. In parallel, the data for each individual were merged using weighted averages to generate combined profiles. These were visualized using SVD-MDS.\n\nRaw microarray data are deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus database (accession number GSE47957) and are also available to the public at http://viromics.washington.edu.\n\nWith the exception of the data from microarray experiment, data was analyzed in Prism (GraphPad Software) using the unpaired t-test, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post-test and the Mann Whitney test as indicated."}
