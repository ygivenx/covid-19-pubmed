{"title": "Characteristics and Functions of Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue", "body": "Lymphoid tissue can be identified early in phylogeny in the gills and guts of species more advanced than cyclostomes (Good and Papermaster, 1964; Marchalonis, 1974) . Evidence that this local immune system protects mucosal surfaces independent of circulating antibodies first was suggested by experiments in rabbits that were immunized orally with killed Shigella bacteria. These animals were resistant to experimentally induced bacillary dysentery (Besredka, 1927) . In humans with dysentery, fecal antibodies can be detected before serum antibodies develop (Davies, 1922) . Similar evidence exists for specific local immunity in other mucosal tissues such as the respiratory tract and the female reproductive tract (Amoss and Taylor, 1917; Byrne and Nelson, 1939; Tomasi and Bienenstock, 1968) . We have come to appreciate that the lymphoid elements distributed in different mucosal tissues are part of a unique immune system that confers local immunity in a regulated fashion. This immunity protects a large and fragile epithelium, preventing the disruption of the normal physiological function of these mucosal tissues.\n\nTechnical advances in cellular and molecular biology over the last 10 years have changed our ability to probe and examine the nature and function of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). New concepts have emerged and notions previously considered incorrect have been rekindled. In this chapter, we highlight some of these findings as a prelude to the chapters that follow in this section.\n\nMALT can be separated into several components (see Table I ), a few of which are described here.\n\nThe gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is the most extensively studied component of MALT. This tissue consists of organized lymphoid aggregates represented by the Peyer's patches, the appendix, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), and solitary lymphoid nodules. In addition, the nonorganized lymphoid elements in the epithelium-the intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL)-and in the lamina propriathe lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL)-are considered part of GALT. Collectively, this mass of lymphoid tissue easily would challenge other lymphoid organs in size (see Figure 1 ).\n\nIn the chicken, an additional specialized organ can be found at the end of the intestine and is referred to as the bursa of Fabricius. This organ has been shown to be the site of primary B-cell development in the chicken (Cooper et al., 1966; Perey et al., 1968) , a function that remains difficult to localize to any one organ in mammals.\n\nBurdon-Sanderson first described the lymphoid tissue in the lung in 1867 and noted that \"these lymphoid follicles in the bronchial walls are therefore in every respect analogous to the lymph follicles found in other mucous membranes, e.g., tonsils, and in the intestine\" (Klein, 1875) . Similarities between the organized lymphoid tissue in the lung and GALT led to the term bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT; Bienenstock et al., 1973a,b) . As reviewed elsewhere in this book, BALT consists of lymphoid aggregates distributed in the larger passageways of the respiratory tract. As in GALT, specialized antigen sampling structures represented by lymphoid follicles with overlying follicle-associated epithelia (FAE) that contain specialized epithelial cells referred to as M cells are seen (Bienenstock and Johnson, 1976) . In addition, lymphocytes are distributed in the subepithelial spaces as well as within the epithelium of the bronchi (Bienenstock, 1984) . This organization suggests a functional role for BALT that is not dissimilar from that of GALT.\n\nThe term \"mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue\" (MALT) arose from the realization that not only did mucosal surfaces share organizational similarities in their lymphoid elements, but also functional ones . As discussed subsequently, MALT is characterized by the predominance of local IgA production and by the finding that activated lymphocytes derived from one mucosal surface can recirculate and localize selectively to other mucosal surfaces. This connection between different mucosal surfaces permits immunity initiated at one anatomical site to protect other mucosal sites. Therefore, the tissues that are considered part of MALT include the middle ear, parts of the urogenital tract, Kuper et al., 1992] , as well as BALT and GALT (see Figure 2 ).\n\nSignificant species differences exist in the ontogeny of mucosal lymphoid tissues that suggest possible differences in function. In humans, lymphoid aggregates are present at birth whereas in rodents they develop after the first few weeks of life. In humans Peyer's patches develop in utero and increase in size and number with the exposure to gut flora, but then decrease with age (Cornes, 1965) . T and B cells are found in clusters by 14 weeks gestation and increase in number thereafter; the early B cells express IgM, IgD, and CD5 (Spencer et al., 1986a) . Germinal centers only develop after birth (Bridges et al., 1959) .\n\nIn the mouse, follicles are first identified as a cluster of reticular cells that, by day 3 after birth, become populated by lymphocytes (Joel et al., 1971; Ferguson and Parrott, 1972a) . Primary nodules then appear between 3 and 7 days and germinal centers between 4 and 5 weeks of age (Ferguson and Parrott, 1972a) , but not in germ-free mice (Pollard and Sharon, 1970) . Interestingly, no germinal centers are seen in the Peyer's patches of the nude mouse, suggesting a T-cell dependence (Parrott, 1976) . Therefore, in humans a significant degree of Peyer's patch development appears to occur independent of gut flora.\n\nIn humans, lymphoid cells including CD4 + T cells appear in the lamina propria by 14 weeks gestation, whereas B cells appear by 22 weeks gestation. Plasma cells, on the other hand, only develop 12 days after birth (Perkkio and Savilahti, 1980; Spencer et al., 1986a) , whereas plasma cells in the lamina propria appear only after day 10 in the mouse. In humans, IELs can be identified in the fetal intestine by 11 weeks gestation (Spencer et al., 1986b) , whereas in mice IEL are found only by the third week of life (MacDonald and Spencer, 1990) . Although this event is coincident with weaning in the mouse, it is not antigen-dependent (Ferguson and Parrott, 1972b; Ferguson, 1977) . On the other hand, the gut flora does influence the number and phenotype of IELs (Ferguson and Parrott, 1972a; Leigh et al., 1985) . Clearly, luminal antigen has a great influence on the development of several compartments of GALT in humans and in rodents.\n\nThe function of MALT can be divided into three main categories (Table II) . The induction of the local immune response and the effector mechanisms of local immunity have been the focus of much of the experimental work on MALT. In addition, however, the role that MALT may play as a primary immune organ, as suggested long ago, has become the focus of more recent work. The compartmentalized anatomy of GALT and its constituent immune cells. Although differences exist between different tissues, the general organization of MALT is similar to that depicted for GALT. Figure 2 Lymphoid elements in GALT from the bone marrow or thymus enter the mucosa through specific high endothelial venules to occupy the different compartments. Thymic-independent mucosal T cells may arise in the fetal liver or bone marrow or develop within the intestine itself. Primary antigen exposure can occur within the Peyer's patches or possibly in the draining lymph nodes. In the Peyer's patches, B cells committed to IgA production and sensitized to foreign antigen are stimulated to proliferate. Lymphoblasts emigrate via the efferent lymphatics and mesenteric lymph nodes to the thoracic duct to recirculate via the blood stream. T lymphoblasts, detected in the thoracic duct lymph, also can recirculate. These cells can repopulate various mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues selectively undergo terminal differentiation.\n\nOne of the most intriguing organs of the mucosal immune system is the bursa of Fabricius. Found in chickens, the bursa is a specialized organ that contains a major collection of lymphoid follicles in a hollow pouch-like outgrowth dorsal to the cloaca at the end of the gut. This outgrowth is attached to the cloaca by a long thin duct. The mucosal surface within this pouch is folded and contains numerous lymphoid follicles. The epithelium overlying these follicles does not lie on Primary lymphoid development Induction and amplification of the mucosal immune responses Effector mechanisms of local immunity a basement membrane and is part of a stratified network of stellate cells that forms the medulla of each follicle. This medulla is bounded by the basal lamina, and the cortex of the follicle lies outside this basal lamina. Lymphocytes infiltrate the medulla and epithelium overlying the follicle and may form clumps (Owen and Bhalla, 1983) . This \"lymphoepithelium\" represents the site of primary B-cell development in the chicken (Owen and Bhalla, 1983) . The bursa also can serve in antigen sampling.\n\nIn mammals, the absence of a bursa or any other clearly identifiable organ of primary B-cell development has led to a search for the 4 'mammalian bursa equivalent.\" The fact that the bursa of Fabricius is part of the intestine led to speculation that mammalian GALT might serve as a site of primary lymphoid development. The features of the bursa that are characteristic of a primary lymphoid organ include a follicular structure that develops independent of antigenic stimulation, the absence of fully differentiated plasma cells; the presence of rapid cellular proliferation, thymic independence, essential nature with respect to the development of follicles in other secondary lymphoid organs, and identification as the first site of immunoglobulin synthesis (Perey, 1971) . Mammalian GALT does not fulfill all these characteristics.\n\nIn 1963, Archer first suggested that the rabbit appendix might represent the bursa homolog (Archer et al., 1963) , an idea that was supported by others . Several groups have shown that X irradiation and removal of the appendix, Peyer's patches, and sacculus rotundus in rabbits leads to a selective defect in antibody production (Cooper et al., 1966; Perey et al, 1970; Heatley et al., 1982) . On the other hand, the lymphoid aggregates, associated with the epithelium, such as the tonsil and Peyer's patches, do not appear to have a true lymphoepithelium in which primary B-cell development occurs (Perey, 1971) . Further, Peyer's patches are found in the chicken, in which the bursa is clearly the site of B-cell development (Befus et al., 1980) . Therefore, the existence of a mammalian bursa equivalent in the intestine remains controversial (Archer et al., 1963; Fichtelius, 1966; Meuwissen et al., 1969; Perey et al., 1970) . More recent studies now point to the fetal yolk sac, liver, spleen, and bone marrow as sites of primary B-cell development in mammals .\n\nHowever, this issue has been re-examined in the lymphoid follicles of the proximal colon in rodents and in the Peyer's patches in sheep (Perry and Sharp, 1988; Motyka and Reynolds, 1991) . In sheep Peyer's patches, for example, antigen-independent B-cell proliferation and local apoptosis occur, and evidence suggests that immunoglobulin diversity is generated in situ (Griebel et al., 1991; Motyka and Reynolds, 1991; Reynaud et al., 1991) . The CD5 or Lyl B-cell lineage also has been shown to develop in lymphoid aggregates, referred to as milk spots, that are found in the omentum of human and mouse Solvason etal., 1992) . Collectively, these data suggest that some degree of early differentiation of B-cell elements can occur in mammalian GALT. The advantage of the local development of the B-cell repertoire is not clear, although one could speculate that it might be involved in the generation of oral tolerance.\n\nT-cell differentiation in the intestine also differs from that of peripheral thymus-derived T cell. Evidence is now emerging that suggests that intestinal T cells, particularly the IELs, can develop independent of thymic processing (Lefrancois et al, 1990; Mosley et al., 1990; Guy-Grand et al., 1991; Barrett et al., 1992; Croitoru and Ernst, 1992) . Although the process of repertoire selection could occur in the intestinal mucosa (Bonneville et al., 1990; Bandeira et al., 1991; Rocha et al., 1991) , this event has not been demonstrated directly. The presence of a diffuse primary lymphoid organ in the intestinal epithelium, albeit for B cells, was suggested first by Fichtelius (1968) . If the mucosal T-cell repertoire does indeed develop in the intestinal environment, the local antigenic milieu could influence the reactivity of these cells.\n\nThe Peyer's patches are lymphoid aggregates, first described by Johanni Conradi Peyeri in 1677 in his thesis entitled \"De Glandulis Intestinorum Earumque Usu et Affectionibus Cui Fubjungitur Anatome Ventriculi Gallinacei.\" These clusters are found on the antemesenteric side of the distal small bowel (ileum) and colon and extend through the lamina propria and submucosa. The patches appear as mounds protruding between the intestinal villi and, on the serosal surface, as a group of small bulges. In humans, Peyer's patches increase in number and size progressively down the distal small intestine.\n\nPeyer's patches differ from lymph nodes elsewhere in the body because they lack afferent lymphatics. This characteristic is in keeping with the notion that antigen is sampled from the lumen via the overlying epithelium. The efferent lymphatics drain to the mesenteric lymph nodes. In the normal adult, Peyer's patches contain germinal centers with B cells and internodular zones that are predominantly T cells (Faulk et al., 1970; Parrott, 1976; Mayrhofer, 1984) . The lymphocytes in the central areas of the follicle include IgM-, IgG-, Ig A-, and IgE-producing B cells, although IgA-producing cells predominate. Interspersed are T cells, predominately CD4 helper T cells, and macrophages that function as antigenpresenting cells (APCs).\n\nThe Peyer's patches are considered a major site of initiation of the local immune response in the gut, although some Kenneth Croitoru \u00b7 John Bienenstock researchers suggest that these clusters serve more as an amplification system in which B cells primed elsewhere are exposed to antigen (Waksman and Ozer, 1976) . In this regard, investigators have suggested that the site in which priming of mucosal B-cell responses may occur is the draining lymph nodes (Craig and Cebra, 1971; Gearhart and Cebra, 1979; Cebra et al., 1991) . Nonetheless, in the Peyer's patches, antigen can be taken up and presented to mucosal lymphocytes. The epithelium overlying these lymphoid follicles samples and transports antigen from the lumen to the adjacent APCs and lymphoid cells (Owen and Nemanic, 1978) . Referred to as the FAE, this epithelium is devoid of goblet cells and consists of specialized cuboidal cells derived from adjacent crypts (Owen and Jones, 1974; Bockman and Cooper, 1975; Bhalla and Owen, 1982) . Among the FAE are further specialized cells, the M cells, that have a decreased number of small apical microvilli. The microvilli actually are replaced by microfolds, hence the name \"M cell.\" In addition, M cells have increased numbers of cytoplasmic vesicles in which particulate antigen is transported across the cell from luminal to basement membrane surface (Owen and Jones, 1974; Owen, 1977; Smith and Peacock, 1992) . Some viruses and bacteria have been shown to bind to M cells specifically (Inman and Cantey, 1971; Carter and Collins, 1974; Wolf er ai, 1981) , making this a preferential route of entry. Given the concentration of antigen uptake at this site one should note that erosion of the FAE over the surface of Peyer's patches, (the aphthous ulcer) is the earliest lesion seen in Crohn's disease (Rickert and Carter, 1980) . The antigen transported into the Peyer's patches is then taken up by macrophages, which process and present antigen to the local T cells (MacDonald and Carter, 1982) . The underlying progenitors of IgA-secreting plasma cells found in the Peyer's patches are then the first lymphocytes to be exposed to these foreign antigens (Craig and Cebra, 1975; .\n\nThe absorptive epithelial cells on the luminal two-thirds of the villi of the small bowel of rat and human express the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II antigen (Scott et al., 1980; Mayrhofer et al., 1983) . The FAE overlying the Peyer's patches, on the other hand, are devoid of MHC Class II expression (Owen, 1977) , suggesting that the intestinal epithelial cells may have a role in antigen presentation distinct from that of the FAE. Interestingly, the epithelial cells have been shown to stimulate the CD8 or cytotoxic/ suppressor T cell preferentially (Mayer and Schlien, 1987; Bland, 1988; Bland and Kambarage, 1991) . This preference may represent a mechanism that down-regulates the local immune response, preventing unwanted inflammatory responses to food antigens and normal gut flora.\n\nIgA, first discovered by Heremans (Heremans et al., 1959) , was shown to exist in the unique form of secretory IgA (SIgA) as the predominant immunoglobulin in external secretions (Chodirker and Tomasi, 1963; Tomasi et aL, 1965) . In addition to IgA, IgG-, IgM-and IgE-secreting cells exist in the intestinal lamina propria, albeit at a much lower frequency. Phylogenetically, IgA is not found in some lower life forms such as cold-blooded animals. IgA deficiency in humans is associated variably with significant disease or morbidity, suggesting that IgA is not necessary for survival. However, IgA does represent a considerable advance in the adaptation of the local immune response to the rather hostile environment encountered in mucosal secretions. Certain functional properties of IgA make it ideal for protecting mucosal surfaces. First, IgA is more resistant to proteolytic degradation than IgG or monomeric IgA (Shuster, 1971; Underdown and Dorrington, 1974) . Second, a specific mechanism exists for the transport of polymeric IgA (or IgM) from the lamina propria into the lumen via the epithelial cell receptor, secretory component (SC) . Finally, IgA does not activate complement via the classical pathway and, therefore, tends not to induce potentially damaging inflammatory reactions (Colten and Bienenstock, 1974) , but functions to neutralize toxins and viruses (Ogra et aL, 1968; Holmgren et aL, 1975) and to prevent bacterial adherence to epithelial cells (Williams and Gibbons, 1972) .\n\nIgE-producing cells are found in the mucosal tissues, including Peyer's patches, as well. Durkin et al. (1981) , in fact, showed that the numbers of IgE-bearing cells were increased in neonatal and germ-free mice and that, on conventionalization, this reverted to IgA synthesis.\n\nThe predominance of IgA in mucosal secretions is thought to be the result of the collection of IgA-selective regulatory T cells. For example, in the Peyer's patches, regulatory helper T cells are involved in switching IgM + B cells to IgA + B cells as well as in the terminal differentiation of IgA B cells (Kawanishieia/., 1983a,b; Beagleyeftf/., 1989; McGhee et aL, 1989) . As discussed subsequently, when these lymphocytes encounter antigen and become activated, they leave the Peyer's patches, since antigen specific Ig cannot be detected in Peyer's patches after oral immunization . These lymphocytes recirculate back to the mucosa, occupying the lamina propria, where the B cell differentiates into IgA-secreting plasma cells . Therefore, the presence of dimeric IgA has become synonymous with MALT.\n\nWithin the epithelium, above the basement membrane, is a heterogenous population of mononuclear cells referred to as IELs. These cells include a large population of T cells expressing T-cell receptor and CD8. The nature of these cells, their function, and their lineage relationship to thymicdependent T cells is not clear (Croitoru and Ernst, 1992) . In addition, IELs contain mast cells and their precursors, as well as antitumor and antiviral natural killer (NK) cells (Arnaud-Battandier et aL, 1978; Tagliabue et aL, 1982; Schrader et aL, 1983; Ernsts aL, 1985; Carman etaL, 1986) . This population, therefore, has both natural cytolytic activity and classical MHC-restricted cytotoxic T cells . The granules of IELs contain proteases that may play a role in influencing epithelial cell function . In fact, a possible biological function of the IELs may be regulating the absorptive and secretory function of the epithelial cells in response to antigenic stimuli. This regulation could occur through the release of the contents of these granules or through the release of cytokines, and would be important to consider when examining the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases of the bowel.\n\nWithin the lamina propria are lymphocytes with cytotoxic potential as well as T cells with the ability to produce cytokines. The cytotoxic T cells include cells that can be activated by stimulation of the T-cell receptor to produce tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) or interferon \u03b3 (IFNy) (Elson et aL, 1986; James and Strober, 1986; Deem et aL, 1991) . These cytokines have been shown to affect epithelial cell growth and function, including the expression of MHC Class II molecules used for antigen presentation Lundin et aL, 1990) . Such interactions between elements of GALT and the structural elements of the intestine are emerging as important functions to examine in our attempt to understand the control of the physiological function of the gut.\n\nThe regulation of these effector functions is, in part, influenced by the local nervous tissue. The mucosal tissues, because they are highly innervated, have a major accumulation of neurotransmitters such as substance P, somatostatin, and vasointestinal polypeptide (VIP). These neurotransmitters have been shown to interact with and regulate the local immune response. Substance P, for example, can influence lymphocyte proliferation, antibody secretion, and even mucosal NK activity (Stanisz et aL, 1986; Croitoru et aL, 1990) . Further, VIP has been shown to influence the selective trafficking of lymphocytes to mucosal tissues (Ottaway, 1984) . These and other influences of neuropeptides and the local immune cells provide a mechanism for important interactions between the central nervous system and the local immune response (Steady\u00ab/., 1987).\n\nAs discussed earlier, mucosal lymphocytes can recirculate and traffic between different mucosal tissues (see Figure 2 ). The MLN, for example, contains precursors for IgA plasma cells that, when adoptively transferred, will repopulate the lamina propria within 24 hr (Gowans and Knight, 1964) . Thoracic duct lymphocytes also recirculate and enter the lamina propria (Gowans and Knight, 1964) ; this movement appears to be antigen independent (Ferguson, 1974; Halstead and Hall, 1992) . Both Peyer's patch lymphocytes and BALT contain precursors for IgA-secreting plasma cells (Craig and Cebra, 1975 ) that could seed the intestinal lamina propria . More recent work has examined the interactions that occur between the circulating lymphocytes and the vascular endothelium in the mucosa and Peyer's patches that allow for the selective homing to mucosal tissues (Gallatin et aL, 1983; Navarro et aL, 1985; Jalkanen et aL, 1988) .\n\nThis homing highlights the communication that exists between different mucosal sites, and allow specific antigen reac-tivity to extend quickly over all these tissues ). Thus, the common mucosal immune system or MALT functionally behaves as one immune organ McDermott and Bienenstock, 1979) . The value of this function is exemplified by the success of oral vaccination with poliovirus, for which immunization at one mucosal site leads to protection at a second.\n\nOne of the mysteries of mucosal immunology has been the fate of the IEL population. Considered by some as terminally differentiated cells, IELs have been speculated to cross the basement membrane in both directions (Marsh, 1975) . In fact, work in Eimeria-intected chicken has shown that IELs containing the parasite acquired in the epithelium can return to the tissues (Lawn and Rose, 1982) . On the other hand, IELs have poor migratory ability (Bacq et al., 1987) and turnover at quite a different rate than the adjacent epithelium (Darlington and Rogers, 1966) .\n\nDetails of the molecular interactions and adhesion molecules involved in the selective trafficking of mucosal lymphocytes are discussed in other chapters.\n\nMALT is a complex immune organ spread over a large noncontiguous tissue that is the major barrier between the external and internal environments. This organ has evolved to protect the host without inducing potentially damaging local inflammatory responses. How this tightly regulated response is altered and how the integrity of mucosal surfaces is maintained is the key to understanding these tissues, and may be the key to the treatment of disease involving these tissues."}
