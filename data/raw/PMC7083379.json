{"title": "Influenza Sentinel Surveillance and Severe Acute Respiratory\nInfection in a Reference Hospital in Southern Brazil", "body": "Influenza viruses cause seasonal infections and are associated with morbidity and\nmortality. The recommended treatment for influenza is neuraminidase inhibitors, and\nvaccination might be the best choice for public health prevention, considering the\ncomplications among high-risk patients\n1\n\n,\n\n2\n. The peak timing of influenza-like illness (ILI) varies seasonally, and the\ncharacterization of the regional dispersion of this virus are important for introducing\npreventive measures.\n\nThe many influenza A subtypes are determined by the presence of specific hemagglutinin\nand neuraminidase, and some subtypes are associated with pandemic episodes\n1\n. Influenza B is classified into two genetic and antigenically distinct lineages,\nVictoria and Yamagata\n1\n. Although not a potential pandemic virus, influenza B is often the cause of\noutbreaks in humans and is characterized by a clinical pattern of intermediate severity.\nHowever, fatalities among influenza B cases can occur, especially in the pediatric\npopulation\n3\n. Influenza A subtypes H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 and both influenza B lineages have been\ndetected in Brazil during influenza seasons\n4\n.\n\nThe clinical manifestations of influenza virus infection include fever, headache,\nmyalgia, cough, and sore throat. The signs of severity include oxygen saturation\n<95%, dyspnea, and respiratory discomfort. The presence of severe disease sets the\ndiagnosis of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), which also requires notification\nin the Brazilian health system\n5\n.\n\nEmerging influenza viruses include A/H7N9, A/H3N2(v), and A/H5N1 subtypes\n6\n. Surveillance for these emerging viruses is important and includes both active\nand passive surveillance systems. The goal of these systems is the rapid and early\nidentification of potentially epidemic strains to prevent their spread. Surveillance\nsystems are designed to detect triggers with possible hazards to public health to\nprovide early warning and establish measures to minimize the risks of global\neffects\n7\n. \n\nThis study reported the findings of 2 consecutive years of influenza infection active\nsurveillance and respiratory virus (RV) investigation conducted in hospitalized\npatients, evaluated influenza seasonality in this region, correlated virus circulation\nwith temperature and rainfall data, analyzed the epidemiological and clinical impacts,\nand compared the severity of influenza infections to those of other respiratory virus\n(ORV) infections.\n\nThis cross-sectional study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Board and\nperformed at Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas/Universidade Federal do Paran\u00e1 (HC/UFPR), Southern\nBrazil.\n\nOverall, 775 patients were selected from two databases. (i) The first group included 321\nhospitalized individuals who underwent laboratory testing for RVs in 2012 (127/321; 40%)\nand 2013 (194/321; 60%). Medical charts of the selected group were reviewed, focusing on\nepidemiology, clinical manifestations, outcomes, laboratory findings, and SARI diagnosis\ncriteria. (ii) The second group included another 454 cases of hospitalized patients in\nHC/UFPR that were previously notified as SARI by the Epidemiology Hospital staff during\n2012 and 2013. Epidemiological and clinical data for this group were electronically\nretrieved from the SARI notification system. SARI was defined as influenza-like illness\nalong with signs of severity (dyspnea, oxygen saturation <95%, or respiratory\ndiscomfort)\n5\n.\n\nMeteorological data for Curitiba-Paran\u00e1 (Brazil), including monthly average temperature\n(\u00b0C) and rainfall (mm3) from January 2012 to December 2013, were obtained\nfrom the Sistema Meteorol\u00f3gico do Paran\u00e1 (SIMEPAR) database. Curitiba is located in\nsouthern Brazil, at latitude 25.5\u00b0S, and has a temperate climate.\n\nRVs were detected by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)\nusing the Seeplex\u00ae RV15 ACE Detection kit (Seegene Inc, Korea, according to the\nmanufacturer\u2019s protocol. This kit enables the simultaneous detection of multiple RVs:\nhuman adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses (PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, and\nPIV-4), influenza A (FLUA), influenza B (FLUB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV-A,\nRSV-B), human rhinovirus type A and B (HRV A/B), human enterovirus, and human bocavirus,\nand human coronavirus type 229E/NL63 (alfa-coronaviruses) and OC43/HKU1\n(beta-coronaviruses). Influenza A subtyping was performed using real-time RT-PCR\n(rtRT-PCR) according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protocol\n8\n. Influenza B-positive samples were tested to identify lineages using a single\none-step rtRT-PCR, as previously reported\n9\n.\n\nData were analyzed using R (R CORE TEAM, 2018), version 3.3.4. Parametric and\nnon-parametric tests were used to assess differences between continuous variables with\nnormal and asymmetric distributions, respectively. Fisher\u2019s exact and Pearson\u2019s\nchi-square tests were used to assess differences between categorical variables, as\nappropriate. Covariates were examined in univariate analysis to determine their\nassociation with influenza and other RV infections. Those with\np<0.05 were included in the multivariate analysis. Using a stepwise\nconditional procedure, multivariate logistic regression models were conducted to\nidentify independent predictors considering the presence of influenza or other RV\ninfection as the endpoint. To verify the quality of the fit (goodness-of-fit), we used\nthe Hosmer-Lemeshow test and qq-plot graph; both showed a good fit of the proposed model\nto the data. All p-values were two-tailed and\np<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nOverall, 444 (58.8%) patients had virus-positive samples. As seen in Table 1, influenza virus was detected in 46 samples\n(10.4%), including 37 (80%) with influenza A and nine (20%) with influenza B. The most\ncommonly detected virus was HRV (162 cases). Viral co-detection occurred in 127 cases\n(29% of positive samples); among the influenza virus infections, we found eight\nco-detections, mainly with HRV. Compared to ORVs, there was a lower rate of co-detection\namong influenza cases (17%). Whether viral co-infections may enhance pathogenicity\nduring infection requires further investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, 83% (31/37) of influenza A samples were subtyped; of these, 24 (65%) were\nA/H1N1pdm09 and seven (20%) were seasonal A/H3. Lineage differentiation of the influenza\nB-positive revealed that all were Victoria-like (Figure\n1).\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth influenza and ORV were predominant in children aged <2 years. This represented\n35% (16/46) of the influenza cases and 73% (290/398) of ORV cases. The median age\ndiffered significantly between influenza and ORV cases, at 5.4 and 0.7 years,\nrespectively (Table 1). Influenza infection\naffected more patients aged 14-60 years, a population that remains susceptible to the\nvirus, as the public health system provides the vaccine to children (<5 years),\nelderly (>60 years), health workers, and patients with comorbidities. In addition,\nthe likelihood of influenza infection increased proportionally with age.\n\nThe vaccination status data had a large amount of missing information due to the\nretrospective nature of this study. Of 46 patients with influenza, only 26% had records\nof receiving the influenza vaccine in the last year. These findings emphasize the need\nto expand immunization coverage in high-risk patients. Most patients infected had not\nreceived the vaccine or those who presented a low immune response\n10\n.\n\nUnlike in immediate post-pandemic years, a reduction in antiviral use in patients with\ninfluenza infection was observed. Among all cases of influenza in this study, only 35%\nof the patients received oseltamivir. Moreover, just 25% of these patients had treatment\ninitiated within 48 hours of symptom onset, although all symptomatic patients in this\nperiod of disease should be treated. The Brazilian Health Ministry recommends treatment\ninitiation in all patients within <48 hours of symptom onset and in those with SARI\ndiagnosis regardless of the timing of symptoms\n5\n.\n\nInfluenza-infected patients showed more cases of fever (93%), cough (100%), and myalgia\nthan those in patients infected by ORVs (Table\n2). Even though influenza infections comprised only 10% of the total cases of RV\ndetected in this study, these viruses represented 44% of all cases with myalgia.\nFurthermore, influenza infections tended to cause more severe disease, with more cases\nof SARI; however, this finding should be confirmed by prospective studies with higher\nnumbers of patients. Of the 775 total cases in this study, 70% (535/775) were diagnosed\nwith SARI and 57% (444/775) were virus-positive, 8% of which were positive for influenza\n(Table 2). Adjusted analysis showed that\npatients who were older, with SARI, and with myalgia had increased chances of positive\nresults for influenza. Therefore, older patients with SARI diagnosis should be treated\nas having influenza infections until the laboratory investigation is completed. \n\n\n\n\n\nChest X-ray was performed in 55% (201/444) of the positive patients, 80% of which showed\nsome abnormality. Significant alterations such as interstitial pneumonia (36% and 32%,\np=0.69), pulmonary consolidation (25% and 27%,\np=1.00) and mixed patterns (25% and 5%, p<0.05)\nwere reported in patients infected with influenza and ORVs, respectively. Most studies\nneglected the analysis of X-ray patterns in respiratory tract infections caused by\ninfluenza, which showed statistical relevance in this analysis. In 18 influenza-infected\npatients, the radiographic findings were either consolidation or mixed patterns, none of\nwhich had simultaneous bacterial detection. These results emphasize that severe tissue\ndamage is found in hospitalized patients with pneumonia caused by influenza.\n\nComparison of the epidemiological and clinical characteristics reported in this study\nbetween patients with influenza virus A and B infections revealed no statistically\nsignificant results differences, although the low prevalence of influenza B virus may\nhave impaired this assessment. \n\nStudies that aimed to compare the clinical presentation of influenza patients across\nvirus types and subtypes/lineages have reported divergent results; however, in general,\ndespite differences in age distribution, the clinical illnesses produced by the\ndifferent influenza virus types and subtypes are indistinguishable\n11\n. \n\nIn both years, influenza cases were more common in June and July. The study results\nshowed an association between influenza rates and decreased temperature (Figure 2). However, unlike previous findings, no\nassociation was observed between influenza circulation and rainfall during the study\nperiod\n12\n. Studies on influenza seasonality in Brazil have shown distinct patterns of\nviral circulation; in the Northeast region, influenza circulates in the first 4 months\nof the year, overlapping with a period of higher humidity in that area\n13\n\n,\n\n14\n. These different circulation profiles due to the climatic conditions of each\nregion impact the vaccine effectiveness, which in tropical regions has been carried out\nin a period subsequent to viral circulation. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe 10.4% influenza positivity among samples found is similar to that in previous\nreports\n7\n\n,\n\n12\n\n,\n\n14\n; however, the present study tested a larger number of influenza A virus samples\nfor subtypes. In Brazil, there was a non-homogeneous distribution of influenza A\nsubtypes. Laboratory surveillance data in the Southern region showed a higher frequency\nof influenza A/H1N1pdm than A/H3N2, at 61% and 38%, respectively. In the Northeastern\nregion, which has different climatic conditions, there was circulation of influenza\nA/H3N2 in the first 16 epidemiological weeks (EW) and then an increased detection of\nH1N1pdm between the 20th. and 30th EW, but with a lower intensity\nthan occurred in the Southeastern and Southern regions\n4\n. These findings highlight the need to subtype influenza samples from distinct\nregions to improve the surveillance system. \n\nAmong influenza B cases, 78% occurred in 2013 and reintroduction of the Victoria lineage\nwas observed. In 2013, 89% of the influenza B cases in the region were antigenically\ncategorized as the B/Brisbane/60/2008, Victoria lineage\n4\n. In both years, the predominant circulating lineage was Victoria-like, a variant\ndifferent from that selected for vaccine composition (A/H1N1pdm and A/H3N2, a virus\nsimilar to the B/Wisconsin/1/2010, Yamagata lineage\n10\n), highlighting the importance of updated information on circulating viruses to\ndetermine the vaccine composition. These findings emphasize the importance of public\nvaccination and studies on circulating virus strains.\n\nAlthough the difference was not statistically significant, the rate of severe cases among\ninfluenza B (5/9 cases, 55%) was higher than previously reported\n3\n. More recent reports have also shown similar findings, with incidences of severe\ndisease in influenza B of up to 50%\n15\n. This finding underscores the relevance of influenza B infection, which has\nusually been associated with mild disease\n\nThis study had some limitations. The retrospective data collection may have contributed\nto the loss of some clinical and laboratory information. The parameters with higher\nrates of missing data were the vaccination status and the radiographic patterns. A\nprospective study involving a wider period of time would improve the analysis, allowing\nevaluation of the seasonality of influenza B cases.\n\nIn conclusion, influenza infections were associated with seasonal and severe disease,\noccurred more commonly in older patients, and usually, in a non-immunized population.\nThe influenza treatment rates should be increased and treatment should be initiated\nearlier, especially in critically ill patients. An increased frequency of influenza B\ninfections occurred in 2013, probably due to a mismatch between the vaccine and the\ncirculating lineage. Strengthening surveillance systems within institutions is important\nto rapidly identify the circulation of pathogens that present a risk to public\nhealth."}
