{"title": "Viral pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantion", "body": "This review focuses on common community-acquired respiratory viruses transmitted via aerosolized droplets or direct contact to patients with hematologic malignancy (HM) and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. These include influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human enterovirus (HEV), human rhinovirus (HRV), coronavirus (CoV), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Cytomegolavirus (CMV) has also been included, as CMV pneumonia plays an important role among immunocompromised patients. Other latent endogenous viruses associated with viral pneumonia in this population are less prevalent and are beyond the scope of this article.\n\nNo standard definition for viral pneumonia is accepted. A distinction is generally made between viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Viral LRTI includes viral tracheitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis and alveolitis. Viral pneumonia is typically understood to describe an infectious syndrome with (1) symptoms consistent with a respiratory infection (e.g. cough, rhinorrhea, dyspnea), (2) isolation of a viral pathogen known to cause respiratory infections from either nasal, oropharyngeal, tracheal or bronchoalveolar secretions and (3) new infiltrates on chest x-ray (CXR) or computed tomography (CT).\n\nPatients receiving T-cell depleting chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. alemtuzumab, fludarabine or antithymocyte globulin) appear to remain at elevated risk both during treatment and, in some cases, for years after treatment has been completed 25, 26 . The use of these agents appears especially important for the risk of developing CMV disease in HSCT recipients 11, [27] [28] [29] . Furthermore, as infection with viruses such as influenza and RSV can directly impair lymphocyte function in previously healthy patients 30 , even moderate chemotherapy-induced lymphopenia and/or lymphocyte dysfunction may place HM/HSCT patients at elevated risk of viral pneumonia.\n\nIn a large single center study, 44% of HSCT patients with acute GVHD developed viral pneumonia, compared to 22% among patients without GVHD 7 . Similar findings are described for HSCT patients who develop CMV disease 12,31-33 and other individual respiratory viruses 10, 11, [34] [35] [36] [37] .\n\nCMV pneumonia principally arises from disease reactivation. HSCT recipients who are seropositive for CMV (R+) prior to transplant, irrespective of donor status, are at the highest risk for reactivation of latent virus 38 . Alternately, as seronegative recipients (R\u2212) face limited reactivation risk, their rate of CMV pneumonia is lower than R+ recipients, even with seropositive donors (D+) 39 .\n\nAdditional risk factors for the progression of viral URTI to viral pneumonia identified by multivariate analyses include age greater than 65 years 8 , hypoalbuminemia 40 , and cumulative dose of corticosteroids 20, 37, 41, 42 .\n\nExposure to viruses is prominently driven by seasonal variation in viral carriage. In general, influenza, RSV and hMPV infections peak in late autumn and continue through winter. HRV demonstrates biphasic peaks in autumn and spring. Parainfluenza rates are highest in spring and summer, although certain sub-types are present all year. Pandemics and localized outbreaks further increase risk.\n\nWhile most virus are acquired through community or household contacts, nosocomial outbreaks also result in significant morbidity and mortality due to intensive exposures to the healthcare environment coupled with disease-related susceptibility to viral infections. Careful molecular typing of viral isolates has demonstrated that nosocomial outbreaks persist in the outpatient and inpatient settings despite established infection control practices [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] .\n\n\u2265100\u00b0F with cough and/or sore throat) was applied to patients with solid organ transplant or HSCT who presented with influenza. They found a positive predictive value of only 50% and a negative predictive value of 82% using this criteria 51 . Ferguson and colleagues applied a clinical prediction score using URTI and LRTI symptoms to HSCT recipients and found a positive predictive value of 28.7% and a negative predictive value of 84.5% 52 . These studies suggest that symptoms common to viral infections in immunocompetent patients are moderately sensitive but poorly specific in patients with HM/HSCT.\n\nIn RSV pneumonia, fever, cough, dyspnea and wheezing are common, whereas rhinorrhea and sore throat are less frequently observed 53 . In a large retrospective study of patients with HSCT and PIV, 87% of patients presented with upper respiratory tract symptoms and 6% presented with both upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms 54 . HRV infections usually exacerbates symptoms associated with an underlying chronic lung disease and include dyspnea, chest tightness and wheezing [55] [56] [57] [58] . HEV presents frequently with cough, even when lower respiratory involvement is not suspected 59 . Limited information is available for hMPV, but cough, wheeze and fever predominate 36, 60 . Symptoms of CMV pneumonia are nonspecific but are usually consistent with a non-suppurative pneumonitis, including nonproductive cough, dyspnea and hypoxia. The presence of fever is variable 61 . Since CMV pneumonia may also be co-incident with CMV viremia, symptoms of fever, malaise, arthralgia, cytopenias and elevation of liver associated enzymes may also occur.\n\nPatients with HM/HSCT have many potential causes of respiratory symptoms, pulmonary infiltrates and fevers. Thus, a high degree of suspicion is essential for diagnosing viral pneumonia in a patient with nonspecific symptoms. The clinician must remain vigilant in consideration of patient risk factors, time of year, and exposure history and those suspected of having a viral infection should be promptly referred for laboratory and radiographic evaluation. Figure 1 presents and algorithmic approach to patients presenting with syndromes suggestive of viral respiratory infections.\n\nViral nucleic acid amplification techniques using PCR, microarray or DNA chip technologies have largely supplanted direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) stains and conventional viral culture for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses. These techniques have been specifically validated in patients with HM/HSCT [62] [63] [64] . Samples for nucleic acid assays are commonly obtained from the nasopharynx using sterile swabs or washings. Similar test performance is observed when analyzing sputum samples, tracheal aspirates and BAL fluid.\n\nWhile plain CXR can demonstrate lower respiratory tract involvement of viral infections, they are nonspecific and have a poor negative predictive value, particularly in HM/HSCT patients. In a study by Logan et al., radiologist-interpreted CXR predicted the correct type of infection in immunocompromised patients with pneumonia only 34% of the time 65 Forty eight percent of patients whose chest CT was suggestive of pneumonia were found to have a CXR that was interpreted as normal 66 .\n\nAs shown in Figure 2 , the CT patterns most commonly observed in viral pneumonias are ground glass opacities (GGOs), nodules, interlobular septal thickening, bronchial wall thickening and subtle changes in attenuation. While it is widely presumed that these distinct radiographic patterns relate to unique histopathologic injury caused by different viruses, there is considerable histopathologic and radiographic overlap between respiratory viruses, rendering the findings nonspecific 67 . Furthermore, patients with HM/HSCT and viral pneumonia frequently have co-infection with bacterial or fungal pathogens, and their radiographic patterns may be further confounded by noninfectious conditions.\n\nInfluenza virus is associated with bronchial thickening, mucus plugging of the terminal bronchioles, GGOs, and nodules that may evolve into confluent opacities 68, 69 . Severe influenza may be associated with secondary infections and/or the acute respiratory distress syndrome, potentially presenting with consolidative opacities. In a case series of adults patients with HM/HSCT with RSV pneumonia, the most common patterns were centrilobular sub-centimeter nodules, airspace consolidation, GGOs and bronchial wall thickening 70 . PIV manifests most often with multiple peribronchial subcentimeter nodules and GGOs 71 . The predominant pattern in hMPV is a mixture of bilateral GGOs and subcentimeter nodular opacities without a predilection for lung zones 72 . Little data is available for HRV viral pneumonia, but bilateral diffuse GGOs are described 73 . CMV may present with a milliary pattern or a diffuse interstitial pneumonitis with GGOs, small centrilobular nodules and air space opacities [74] [75] [76] .\n\nIn order to assess progression to the lower respiratory tract and to detect additional pathogens, BAL is frequently recommended in HM/HSCT patients with respiratory symptoms and identified virus from an upper respiratory sample, particularly in the setting of an abnormal CXR or CT. A meta-analysis of BAL and lung biopsy in patients with cancer and HSCT demonstrated an overall yield of 43% for any infectious etiology by BAL, with 13% of all samples containing identifiable virus 77 . The diagnostic yield of BAL is reduced substantially in HSCT patients if bronchoscopy is delayed more than 4 days after presentation for any infectious cause 78 .\n\nBAL diagnostic performance in CMV pneumonia depends on the analytic modality chosen. Shell vial culture has high sensitivity but poor specificity for diagnosing tissue-invasive disease 79 . Cytologic examination with demonstration of CMV intra-cytoplasmic inclusions is highly specific but poorly sensitive 80 . PCR is highly sensitive and specific if the pretest clinical suspicion for CMV pneumonia is high [81] [82] [83] . In patients without respiratory symptoms, PCR based results may result in false-positives as pulmonary shedding of virus is common in patients with CMV infection without tissue-invasive disease 84, 85 . In theory, false-positives could be mitigated with quantitative PCR techniques but a viral DNA threshold has not been established [86] [87] [88] .\n\nThe prognostic value of isolating virus from the lower respiratory tract by BAL has been the subject of recent investigation. Seo and colleagues found that HSCT patients with new pulmonary infiltrates and BAL-detected PIV had worse 90-day survival than did patients with new infiltrates and PIV detected only in the upper respiratory tract (45% vs. 85%) 89 . Alternatively, a study by Campbell et al. evaluated the prognostic value of quantitative PCR in BAL samples but found high viral copy numbers of PIV was not a predictor of outcome 90 .\n\nThe role of lung biopsy, either surgical or endoscopic, is unclear. Although lung biopsy is superior to BAL in diagnosing noninfectious lung pathology, it is associated with significant complications and procedure-related mortality 77 . High clinical suspicion for a diagnosis other than viral pneumonia would be needed to justify tissue biopsy in HM/HSCT patients with new pulmonary infiltrates. 102 . In a study of HSCT recipients who reside in an outpatient residential facility while undergoing treatment, oseltamivir was provided to all residents after several patients were diagnosed with influenza 103 . After initiation, no new cases of influenza were diagnosed for the duration of the influenza season, which compared favorably with match controls in previous years.\n\nThe humanized monoclonal antibody palivizumab (PVZ) is effective at reducing the rate of RSV transmission in children with HSCT. In a study by Kassis et al. 16 children with HSCT on an inpatient ward who were considered high risk for contracting RSV during an outbreak received PZV, none contracted RSV 104 .\n\nChemoprophylaxis against CMV in recipients of HSCT is critically important in preventing tissue-invasive disease. Prevention strategies are multimodal with a focus on preventing primary CMV infection when possible, preventing CMV reactivation in seropositive HSCT recipients, and preemptive therapy in patients with early indications of CMV reactivation.\n\nChemoprophylaxis is not yet available for other respiratory viral infections. Given unpredictable virus exposure patterns, profound immune defects in HM/HSCT patients, and narrow specificity of available chemopreventative agents, broad stimulation of antiviral responses via host-directed therapies may provide an opportunity to enhance survival in these populations. A number of groups are focused on stimulating antiviral protection through manipulation of pattern recognition receptors [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] .\n\nThere are two classes of antiviral agents approved for the treatment of influenza. M2 proton channel inhibitors amantadine and rimantadine have antiviral activity against influenza A virus. NA inhibitors oseltamivir (oral), zanamivir (inhaled), and peramivir (intravenous) have activity against influenza A and B virus. Given high levels of resistance (in some series reported as >99%) to M2 inhibitors in influenza A H1N1 and H5N3, the CDC now recommends empiric therapy with an NA inhibitor in high risk patients 110 . All patients with HM/HSCT are considered high risk and NA inhibitors should be started without delay in those with confirmed or suspected influenza infection, as this confers a mortality benefit in HM 111 and HSCT 112 both in inpatient and outpatient settings 113 . For most studies, the average duration of NA therapy was 5 days; however, the optimal duration is unknown as patients with HM/HSCT frequently demonstrate prolonged viral shedding.\n\nAerosolized ribavirin, delivered via facemask in a scavenging tent, is approved for the treatment of RSV infection in children and is used frequently in high risk adults. Data supporting its use in adults with HM/HSCT is mainly from retrospective studies which demonstrate improved mortality but no reduction in the progression to pneumonia 8, 114, 115 . Combination therapy with IVIG 115, 116 or PVZ 117-119 also seems to reduce mortality, but Vakil similarly does not clearly reduce progression to pneumonia 120 . Duration of therapy is usually 5 to 7 days but may be longer in severe disease. Aerosolized ribavirin can cause bronchospasm in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is also associated with high treatment cost, especially when combined with IVIG or PVZ.\n\nCompassionate use of ribavirin and IVIG in patients with PIV and hMPV pneumonia has been described, but no mortality benefit or reduction in the rate of progression to pneumonia was demonstrated 34,36,121 .\n\nCMV pneumonia is generally treated with intravenous ganciclovir or foscarnet in combination with IVIG or CMV-specific immunoglobulin (CMV-Ig) [122] [123] [124] [125] , with an intensive induction phase followed by maintenance therapy. Duration of treatment depends on patient risk factors, viral burden, response to treatment, and institutional preference. While generally considered the first line agent, treatment with ganciclovir is limited by myelosuppression and is considered contraindicated in the pre-engraftment phase of transplant and in neutropenic patients. Ganciclovir resistance is also a significant concern. Foscarnet use is limited by nephrotoxicity. Combination therapy has been described in CMV-antigenemia and may play a role in select cases 126 . The oral valine esters valganciclovir and valacyclovir are not recommended. No randomized trials comparing antiviral therapy with or without immunoglobulins are available and the benefit of immunoglobulins is debatable 127, 128 . However, given the high mortality associated with CMV pneumonia and the limited toxicity profile of IVG and CMV-Ig, combination therapy is favored. The choice of immunoglobulin is based on cost, availability and institutional preference.\n\nSeveral novel therapies are under development for a variety of respiratory viruses in HM/ HSCT patients. Table 1 presents an annotated list of promising antiviral therapies.\n\nRates of bacterial, fungal and viral co-pathogen infection are high in HM/HSCT patients with viral infections. Exact rates are difficult to estimate due to confounding elements of related studies, but when identified, prompt treatment of co-pathogens is imperative. Patients with HM/HSCT and comorbid underlying lung disease, particularly asthma and COPD are at increased risk of respiratory failure, especially with HRV infection. Appropriate therapy for bronchospasm and airway inflammation should be part of the treatment algorithm.\n\nThere is significant heterogeneity reported for studies of mortality caused by respiratory viral infections in HM/HSCT patients, and most are based on single-center experience.\n\nPublished mortality rates for influenza pneumonia vary depending on the center, use of NA inhibitors and influenza strain. Data from a large cancer center during the 1991-92 influenza A epidemic demonstrated a 17% mortality from influenza A pneumonia in HSCT patients who had not received NA inhibitors or influenza prophylaxis 129 . Prospective data from several European centers between 1997 and 1998 demonstrated an all-cause mortality in Vakil patients with HSCT and influenza of 25% 17 . In a study with early initiation of oseltamivir in HSCT patients with influenza A or B in Brazil, mortality was 0% in 39 patients studied 112 . During the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, a prospective survey of HSCT recipients at several European centers reported an H1N1 attributable mortality of 6.3% 130 .\n\nMortality from RSV pneumonia is high, with rates reported between 29% and 88% 5, 6, 17, 53, 131 . Mortality from HRV associated pneumonia is commonly associated with co-infection and is between 38% and 83% 21, 40, 132 . Overall mortality in patients with PIV who developed pneumonia in two large retrospective studies was 17% 20 and 35% 54 at 30 days. Very limited data is available for hMPV but mortality rates of 0% 60,133 , 12.5% 36 and 43% 134 have been reported. Risk of mortality from HEV and nonepidemic CoV appears low but more data is needed 35, 59 . Overall 6-month mortality from CMV-pneumonitis in patients with HSCT was 30% in a large transplant center 135 .\n\nRespiratory virus infection may also result in progressive loss of lung function, particularly in patients with HSCT. Erard et al. retrospectively studied 132 patients with HSCT over a 12 year period and found that 58% of patients developed airflow limitations that did not improve following resolution of their infection 135 . Viral infections were also independently associated with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and idiopathic pulmonary syndrome in HSCT 136, 137 .\n\nViral infections may also impact graft function. Toupin et al. \n\nRespiratory viruses are increasingly recognized as a cause of pneumonia in patients with HM/HSCT and are associated with notable morbidity. Modern molecular diagnostic tools coupled with a high index of suspicion can assist identification of patients with viral pneumonia. Chest radiographs or CT scans should be considered in all patients with symptoms and signs of lower respiratory tract involvement and referral to bronchoscopy should not be delayed. Prompt empiric antivirals followed by tailored therapy should be administered when treatments are available and careful management of co-pathogens and comorbid pulmonary disease is critical. Patients with HM/HSCT should receive yearly influenza vaccination. Patients, families, and health-care workers should be routinely educated on hand hygiene and isolation practices while institutional policies for infection control should be strictly enforced. Much remains understudied and large prospective studies are needed to improve our understanding of the role respiratory virus play in patients with HM and HSCT.
