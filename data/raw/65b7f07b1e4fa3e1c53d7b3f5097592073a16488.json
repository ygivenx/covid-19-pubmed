Another twenty Balb/cJ mice injected with sterilized saline through trachea in the same volume were set up as a control. Animal survival rate was then observed. Additionally, 10 Balb/cJ mice were injected with sterilized saline as a control.\n\nIn a separate experiment, tissues including lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys, intestine, heart, brain were collected at a series of time points from Balb/cJ mice infected with MHV-3 through trachea. The samples were snap freezed and kept at a -80 freezer or fixed with 10% formalin for further experiments.\n\nThe tissues that had been fixed with 10% formalin were dehydrated in graded alcohol solutions and xylene and embedded in paraffin. 4-m sections were cut and tissues were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE).\n\nApproximate 40mg of each frozen organ was homogenized in 0.1 mol/L PBS (pH7.4), and the supernatants were subjected to titer analysis on L2 cells by a standard plaque assay as described elsewhere (12, 16) . The titration examination in each organ was repeated for three times in duplicate. \n\nQuantitative data were reported as the means standard deviation for at least three separate experiments. Differences of virus titers between organs at 48h following MHV-3 infection were analyzed by using one-way analysis of variance, and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nBalb/cJ mice inoculated with MHV-3 through trac- \n\nIn a separate set of experiment, tissues including lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys, intestine, heart and brain from Balb/cJ mice infected with MHV-3 through trachea were examined as described above. Various histopathological changes were found in these organs (shown in Fig.2 Intestine, heart and brain: No significant pathological changes were found in these organs ( Fig.3 .\n\nD4, E4, F4).\n\nTo determine viral titers, tissues were homogenized and the supernatants were subjected to titer determination on L2 cells as described previously (12, 16) . Virus plaques were found in all collected organs and increased with the progress of the infection \n\nWidespread fibrin deposition in association with the mfgl2 expression, especially in microvasculars (Fig.7 .\n\nA) and hyaline-membranes ( Fig.7 . B) was detected in the lungs. "}
