The synthetic material is readily incorporated into model vesicles and forms the basis for using synthetic,h omogenous IFITM3 and its derivatives for further studying its structure and biological mode of action.\n\nInterferon-induced transmembrane protein 3( IFITM3) is a1 33 amino acid membrane-associated protein (MP) that inhibits the replication of pathogenic viruses.This protein was first named fragilis and reported by Saitou and co-workers in 2002, [1] but interest surged when its antiviral properties came to light during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Everitt and co-workers [2] reported that patients lacking full IFITM3 were more quickly and severely infected, leading to adramatic increase in mortality.S ubsequent studies have shown that IFITM3 exhibits antiviral activity against al arge number of viruses, [3, 4] including West Nile virus, [5, 6] Dengue virus, [5] [6] [7] Filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg viruses), [8] SARS Coronavirus, [8] Rift Va lley fever virus, [9] HIV-1 [10] and, most recently, Zika virus. [11] IFITM3 and its related proteins (IFITMs) contain two highly hydrophobic intramembrane domains:aconserved loop region, and amore polar N-terminal region that varies in sequence and length (Figure 1a ). Several proposals for its structure,m embrane-spanning topology,a nd mechanism of action have been reported but there is little consensus of how IFITM3 prevents viral replication. [12] Further studies,such as structure determination and investigation of its numerous posttranslational modifications, [13] [14] [15] [16] are hampered in part by lack of access to the pure protein, especially homogeneous material containing the essential posttranslational modifications.\n\nIn this report, we document the production of milligram quantities of homogeneous IFITM3 and key post-translationally modified variants by total chemical synthesis by using aketoacid-hydroxylamine (KAHA) ligation. [17] Key to the success of this work is the unique nature of the KAHA ligation using 5-oxaproline,w hich operates under acidic conditions ideal for solubilizing hydrophobic peptide segments and delivers more soluble peptide esters compared to amide as the primary ligation product. Theu se of 5-oxaproline results in the introduction of homoserine,anon-canonical amino acid, at the ligation site.W hen carefully chosen, we have found that this is an innocuous mutation of many residues and have shown that it does not disturb folding or biological activity. [18] Thes ynthetic route allows facile incorporation of key posttranslational modifications,i ncluding phosphorylation and the attachment of afluorescent dye.This work establishes access to homogenous IFITM3 and will enable further studies on its structure and mode of action.\n\nOur synthetic planning took into account the different structural regions of IFITM3 and took inspiration from amap of key residue constructed by Brass and co-workers. [7] We aimed to synthesize IFITM3 from three segments using two KAHA ligations.F or the first ligation site,w ec hose Ser50Hse,s ince this is located in an exposed loop region that shows considerable variability among IFITM proteins. As the second ligation, we selected Thr95Hse,s ince this site was reported to be one of the few variable sites within an otherwise highly conserved region. This strategy called for the use of av aline a-ketoacid for the ligation, which although somewhat slower than less hindered residues,h as proven to be an excellent choice for KAHA ligations. [18b] Thes ynthesis of segment 3, which contains the IM2 domain, proved to be the most challenging.O wing to its extreme hydrophobicity,wefirst attempted to synthesize it by tert-butyloxycarbonyl solid-phase peptide synthesis (Boc-SPPS), since Boc chemistry is known to be better suited than fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl solid-phase peptide synthesis (Fmoc-SPPS) for the preparation of hydrophobic peptides. [19] Unfortunately,a ll attempts to purify the peptide obtained after HF cleavage were unsuccessful. We next attempted the synthesis of segment 3byFmoc-SPPS,however this was even less efficient, and after only 10 residues,t he amount of impurities was greater than the desired product.\n\nThea ddition of solubilizing tags or backbone protection have been reported to improve the synthesis of hydrophobic peptides. [20] [21] [22] [23] We decided to employ an oligo-arginine tag (ArgTAG)s imilar to one described by Wade and co-workers, [24] which can be removed by basic treatment at room temperature.T his tag presents two advantages:f irst, oligoarginines have been shown to greatly increase the solubility of hydrophobic sequences,t hus making the handling and purification of these segments easier.S econd, this arginine tag is attached to the Cterminus rather than to the backbone of the peptide,thus facilitating its synthesis and incorporation into the peptide.W ith this strategy,F moc-SPPS of the hydrophobic segment proceeded smoothly,a nd the cleaved peptide bearing the (Arg) 7 tag could be readily purified by reverse-phase HPLC.T he synthesis on one gram of resin afforded 128 mg of the purified peptide 3 (7 %overall yield) bearing an N-terminal 5-oxaproline.T he central segment, bearing aC -terminal valine a-ketoacid, was prepared by Fmoc-SPPS,a nd the requisite photoprotected [(2-nitrophe-nyl)ethyl]carbamate-Opr (NpecOpr) was introduced as the final residue. [25] Thefragments NpecOpr-S2-KA (2)and Opr-S3-ArgTAG (3)were joined by the first KAHA ligation. We were pleased to find that the segments were perfectly soluble in a9 5:5 NMP/H 2 Omixture at 20 mm.Despite the use of the hindered valine a-ketoacid, the ligation was almost complete after 10 h, by which time ag el had formed. Ther eaction mixture was diluted to 10 mm with NMP and left at 60 8 8Cfor an additional 10 hb ut no change was observed, thus indicating that the ligation reaction had reached maximum conversion. The ligation mixture was diluted with 1:1CH 3 CN/H 2 Ocontaining 0.1 %T FA,D ODT (2,2'-(Ethylenedioxy)diethanethiol) was added, and the resulting mixture was stirred under handheld UV light at 365 nm for 45 min to remove the Npec group.The reaction mixture was directly purified by HPLC to afford the desired ligated peptide 4 in an overall yield of 37 % (Figure 1 ). Thesecond and final ligation was performed between 1equiv peptide 4 and 1.5 equiv H 2 N-S1-KA 1 at 15 mm in amixture of 95:5 NMP/H 2 O. Thel igation was somewhat slower than typically observed, and after 20 hagel had formed and the ligation did not proceed beyond about 60 %c onversion. Despite the gel formation, the desired ligated product was cleanly formed. Them ixture was diluted to 0.5 mm with carbonate buffer (pH 8.5) and left for 8hto effect the O!N acyl shift of the two homoserine esters.\n\nAfter concentration and purification by HPLC,w e isolated 16.3 mg (22 %y ield) of the desired IFITM3-ArgTAG (5;F igure 1). Thes ynthetic IFITM3 bearing the C-terminal ArgTAG was characterized by HPLC,H RMS, and SDS-PAGE. ForC Ds pectroscopy,t he protein was incorporated into phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid vesicles and the spectra showed as trong a-helix fingerprint, in accordance with the calculated 3D structure (Figure 1 ). [26] To release the IFITM3 protein from the C-terminal solubilizing tag,p rotein 5 was treated with 0.1m NaOH for 5min. However,decomposition of the protein was observed, in part by hydrolysis of Pro40-Pro41.\n\nTo overcome this problem, we pursued an alternative approach by removing the (Arg) 7 tag prior to the final ligation ( Figure 2 ). After the first ligation and UV irradiation, the reaction mixture was diluted with a0 .25 m NaOH solution until ac oncentration of 0.1m of NaOH was reached. After 5min, the solution was cooled in an ice bath and slowly quenched with as olution of 50 %T FA in water and directly purified by HPLC to afford the desired Opr-S2S3-OH 6 in 24 %y ield after 3s teps ( Figure 2 ). Removal of the ArgTAG under basic conditions gave asingle peak on HPLC.\n\nThefinal ligation, now without the solubilizing group,was performed using 95 %N MP with 5% aqueous oxalic acid. Despite the hydrophobic segment, the ligation proceeded relatively well. Following dilution of the ligation mixture to 0.5 mm with acarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) and stirring for 8hat 23 8 8Ctoeffect O!Nshift, 8.1 mg of unmodified IFITM3 (7) was isolated by preparative HPLC on ah eated C4 column ( Figure 2 ). CD spectra of IFITM3 7 were measured following the same procedure as before.T he CD spectra showed as trong fingerprint for a-helix conformation. Thet wo CD spectra were nearly identical, thus showing that the C-terminal ArgTAG does not influence the 3D structure ( Figure 2 ). Our first attempts at measuring the MS of the IFITM3 protein lacking the solubilizing tag were unsuccessful. As imilar problem was noted by Liu and co-workers during their synthesis of the multidrug-resistance transporter EmrE, another membrane protein , [21] and can be rationalized by the highly hydrophobic nature of the protein and paucity of ionizable sites.W esucceeded in characterizing the protein by digestion under acidic conditions and analysis of the resulting fragments by MALDI-MS.T his procedure gave more than 95 %sequence coverage of IFITM3, confirming the synthesis of the full protein ( Figure 2 ).\n\nSeveral studies have established that posttranslational modifications of IFITM3 are essential for its antiviral activity. [13, 16] Ther ole of these numerous modifications remains as ubject of debate,a nd the inability to prepare and isolate homogeneous protein complicates further efforts.A key advantage of chemical protein synthesis is the ability to ESI-MS spectra of the isolated Opr-S2S3-OH fragment (6) . The green triangles highlight the calibration peaks. c) HPLC trace of the purified IFITM3 (7)at608 8C. d) CD spectra analysis of the reconstituted 5 in PC micelles (grey) and CD spectra analysis of the reconstitutedI FITM3 (7)i n PC micelles (green) (50 mm in 1mmquartz cell). e) SDS-PAGE/Coomassie staining of IFITM3.f)Sequence analysis by MALDI-MSofovernight acid digested IFITM3 shows asequence coverage of 95 %. precisely control the presence or absence of posttranslational modifications,aswell as the power to incorporate probes such as affinity tags or fluorescent dyes to facilitate biochemical and biophysical studies. [27, 28] In our initial efforts at using our synthetic route to IFITM3 derivatives,w ef ocused on one of the most important posttranslational modifications:p hosphorylation of tyrosine 20. In addition, we prepared af luorescently labeled IFITM3 for studies on its incorporation into membrane vesicles.W ehad not previously attempted KAHA ligations with phosphorylated peptides.Our strategy required that the phosphotyrosine be stable to the oxidative conditions for conversion of the phosphorylated segment 1c yanosulfurylide to the corresponding a-ketoacid, as well as to the acidic conditions of the KAHA ligation. Fort he preparation of segment 1c ontaining the phospho-Tyr, we choose O-benzylprotected phospho-Tyr for Fmoc-SPPS,w hich affords the unprotected residue upon TFAc leavage.T he segment synthesis proceeded smoothly and phospho-Tyr was stable to both sulfurylide oxidation and KAHA ligation, affording Ty r20Phos-IFITM3 (8;F igure 3).\n\nSeveral reports have attributed the antiviral activity of IFITM3 to its ability to block the fusion of viral membranes in the endosomes. [4, 29] Thea ctivity of IFITM3 is therefore dependent on its ability to localize into the cell membranes. In order to use IFITM3 and its variants to probe the mode of action, we wished to incorporate the protein into amembrane mimetic and we chose egg phosphatidylcholine as as tarting point. Synthetic IFITM3 was incubated with vesicles and then passed through Sepharose CL-4B exclusion resin. If IFITM3 is inserted into the membrane vesicles,itshould elute with the larger vesicles;the smaller, non-incorporated proteins will be retained. Thef low-through was lyophilized and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Chymotrypsinogen Aw as used as an egative control, as shown in the work of Francis and co-workers. [30] We were pleased to observe that IFITM3 was incorporated into the lipid membrane as expected.\n\nForf urther confirmation that synthetic IFITM3 was incorporated into the membrane,w ep repared aH 2 N-S1-KA segment with an N-terminal 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein by Fmoc-SPPS.R esin cleavage,o xidation of the cyanosulfurylide,a nd ligation with Opr-S2S3-ArgTAG (4)a fforded the protein with the fluorescent dye.T he fluorophore-modified IFITM3 (9)w as incorporated into medium-sized vesicles, passed through the size-exclusion resin, and observed by fluorescence microscopy.A ss hown in Figure 3 , IFITM3 is clearly localized in the membrane of the vesicles,asexpected from the previous experiment.\n\nIn conclusion, we have developed an efficient chemical synthesis of pure IFITM3 on am ulti-milligram scale that makes use of KAHA ligation. This approach provides facile access to IFITM3 bearing natural posttranslational modification, as well as other derivatives that are not possible to prepare with the current recombinant approaches.T he unique feature of KAHA ligation, including its ability to operate under acidic conditions,i ts tolerance of organic cosolvents,a nd the formation of more soluble depsipeptides at the ligation site,m ake it an ideal method for the chemical synthesis of membrane proteins.T his works also establishes that KAHA ligation is compatible with phosphorylated peptide segments and provides access to important posttranslational modifications.T he materials produced by this route will be used for ongoing studies on the role of IFITM3 and its variants on restricting entry of the influenza Avirus."}
