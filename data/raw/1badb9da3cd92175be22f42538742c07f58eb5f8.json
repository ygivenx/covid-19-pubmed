Comparing the disease spread results in these two communities from developed and undeveloped countries through contact-network-based simulation, authors concluded that a moderately transmissible pandemic occurring in developing countries like PNG may be expected to result in a larger illness attack rate compared to that in a developed country setting.\n\nThe paper is interesting but the authors should address the following points, before the paper can be considered for publication.\n\n\u2022 Population density is an important factor affecting disease spread.\n\nAlthough the population sizes of the two communities are similar, the population density is not clearly stated in this paper. Please add in and discuss it.\n\n\u2022 The timing of the interventions relative to the outcomes of the epidemic and the duration of such policies are important to assess their effectiveness, especially when there are two or more socialdistancing interventions involved. However, authors did not discuss the timing of the interventions. Is there trivial interplay between the policies mentioned in the study? Please address this point.\n\n\u2022 Since the contact network is un-weighted, I would assume that a social contact within the households is equivalent to a social contact in the neighborhood in terms of disease transmissibility. If so, this would be a crude assumption and has to be explicitly discussed about how this assumption may affect the results shown in the text.\n\n\u2022 The evaluation of the impact of school closure in mitigating an influenza epidemic might strongly depends by the model assumptions. The coupling effect of workforce closure and school closure should be also evaluated as the compliance rates may vary when implementing them individually or in combination mode. Authors may need to evaluate or discuss this point.\n\nReviewer: Benjamin M. Althouse Comment 1: The study is under-motivated. It is true that most influenza countermeasures are explored with the developed countries in mind and exploration of these countermeasures in developing countries is needed, however, I would like to see more data on differences in attack rates between developed and developing nations beyond \"Data from the 1918/19 pandemic suggests a much higher attack rate in India compared to Europe and the USA [5, 6] .\" (p 4, line 27-29) Perhaps data from the recent 2009 H1N1 could be used to demonstrate clear differences.\n\nResponse: We agree with the reviewer that the rationale for conducting the study required to be made in a more comprehensive fashion. We have now revised the introduction of the manuscript to describe the motivation of our study in greater detail by including recent references on the impact of influenza pandemics on developing countries. We have now illustrated in more detail the deficiencies in preparedness of developing nations to pandemic influenza and the elevated mortality that can be expected if a pandemic influenza occurs in a developing country. We have now cited a number of papers which have documented a) the level of preparedness of developing countries for influenza pandemics in terms of preparedness plans and available infrastructure [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] and b) the mortality burden of historic pandemics in developing countries. [6] [7] [8] .\n\nComment 2: The study is under-referenced throughout. Many general statements are given without citation.\n\nResponse: We have addressed this by including more references e.g., those mentioned in our response to Comment 1 above.\n\nComment 3: There need to be more details about the field study. I find it surprising that it isn\"t detailed given its key role in forming many modeling assumptions (50% school attendance, the existence of social \"hubs\", etc). Where/when was it conducted? Is it reported in another manuscript? (If so, a citation is needed.) What questions were asked? Who were interviewed? Were they representative of the general population? I have trouble blindly accepting many of the key modelling assumptions based on the phrase \"local knowledge\".\n\nResponse: We agree with the reviewer. The methods section \"Madang Demographics\" now contains further details on the survey we conducted in Madang, and this extended section can be found below. The data collected in the field survey are incorporated in Table A1 where the total numbers of all people allocated to specific locations are shown.\n\n\"Madang Demographics\n\nMadang model development used the most recent 2001 census data, other PNG government data and additional field data.\n\n[17] Census data provided the location of groups of approximately 50 adjacent households, known as the census unit (CU). The specific demographics of each household in Madang in terms of number of individuals, their ages and occupation of adults was also provided by the census dataset and each individual is uniquely identified in the model. From July to September 2011 we also conducted a survey in Madang to obtain data on smaller workplaces, school class sizes, market sizes, and the number of people attending the major tertiary education centres in Madang (Divine Word University (DWU), Madang Teachers College, Madang Technical College and Madang Maritime College). We asked the headmasters of Schools and Colleges, the Human Resource department at DWU and business owners of small to medium scale businesses about the respective numbers and, if no records existed relied on their estimates. We also obtained estimates on the size of informal settlements within the town boundaries from the Madang provincial government. The number of children attending schools, as determined by our survey, was much lower than the number of children recorded in the census (approx. 50% of censused children attended a school). The data obtained in the survey are incorporated into Table A1 . These data allowed for the construction of an explicit contact network linking households, schools, workplaces and other meeting places by allocating individuals to these meeting places, similar as in the Albany model [10] .\" Comment 4: The description of the model is wordy, and vague. What \"computer software\" is the model coded in? What do the \"infectious profiles\" actually look like? Ditto the \"household size factor\" (also, the Cauchemez study was conducted in the US, how applicable are their results to PNG)?\n\nAdditional descriptions and figures would be nice to better understand the transmission process.\n\nResponse: We agree with the reviewer. We have clarified the description of the model and stated which computer software was used (C++). We used the Cauchemez study to estimate transmission probability in larger households because it is the best documented and most comprehensively conducted study on this phenomenon. We think that especially in developing countries, where households tend to consist of more members, the feature of decreasing transmission probability between members of households with household size is an appropriate approach to take, as is done in this work.\n\nComment 5: I\"m unclear about the transmission parameters. Were they fixed for R0 = 1.5 for all countries? Or fixed for Australia and allowed to vary for PNG? I assume the latter as R0 is \"estimated\" for PNG, but this should be concretely explained.\n\nResponse: This is correct. The added a clarifying explanation into the \"Influenza Transmission\" section of the manuscript. We used an R0 of 1.5 (as we stated in the manuscript text, this is a realistic estimate for previous pandemics [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] ) to calibrate the basic virus transmissibility (\u03b2V) in the Albany model. Since this is a virus intrinsic parameter, we assume that it is similar in Madang and thus used it to predict the R0 in the Madang and Madang-nnh models.\n\nComment 6: Uncertainty is improperly incorporated in the model in two ways.\n\nComment 6a: Are Tables 1 & 2 based on a single stochastic realization? I hope not, but think they are (again, it\"s very unclear) which is inappropriate. All results presented should be based on thousands of simulations to avoid problems with stochastic variation. I would like to see mean percentages with inter-quartile ranges, or 95% intervals reported.\n\nResponse: We are not presenting a single stochastic realization. We have now clarified this by including the 95% confidence intervals on all values presented in Tables 1 and 2 . We have previously determined that 40 simulation runs are sufficient to verify the model predictions. [15] Thus, here we use 40 stochastic realizations for the calculation of the means and 95% confidence intervals. We have now clarified this in the \"Simulation\" part of the methods section where we have added the following text: \"All simulations were repeated 40 times with random numbers controlling the outcome of stochastic events (the locality of seeded infected individuals and the probability of transmission) and the results were averaged. Analysis of this simulation model has shown that the 40-run mean attack rate is highly unlikely (95% confidence) to differ by more than 1.2% from the mean attack rate of a much larger set of experiment repeats.\"\n\nComment 6b: Although some sensitivity analyses have been presented, they are very limited. The authors point out \"the model is sensitive to some parameter settings\". Which parameters, specifically, and how are they sensitive? I would like to see how variation in parameters in table A2 affect the model output, secifically the probabilities of adult and child withdrawal and the timing of interventions. Incidentally, why were the timing of interventions not discussed in the main text? This is key to the model and may greatly affect the conclusions drawn. These parameters need to be extensively explored.\n\nResponse: We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have now conducted additional sensitivity analyses on the parameters mentioned by the reviewer. Specifically, we have varied the probabilities of adult and child withdrawal from school/work and the response times for intervention activation. The results of the sensitivity analyses can be found in the Supplementary Data File in Tables A5 and A6 . We have also extended the Sensitivity analysis section in the main text to include the results from varying the timing of interventions as follows:\n\n\"The effect of varying compliance with home isolation of school children following school closure on attack rate was examined. Compliance was reduced from 100% to 50%. Reduced compliance increased the attack rate in Albany as those children affected made additional daytime contacts with other children. In Madang, the reduction in compliance had only minimal effect since approximately 50% of school age children do not attend school and continue to make daytime contacts in neighbourhood hubs (see Table A4 , Supplementary Data File).\n\nThe effect of different probabilities of voluntary withdrawal to the home of symptomatic adults and children is on the model outcome is presented in Table A5 . Lower rates of voluntary withdrawal lead to higher attack rates in all three models. Voluntary withdrawal from work or school has a more pronounced effect in the Albany model, as a significant proportion of children in Madang still transmit through daytime contacts in neighbourhood hubs.\n\nThe effects of variation of the timing of intervention initiation are presented in Table A6 . In the school closure scenario, delayed response had the most severe impact on the attack rates in Albany, whereas for the Madang models the changes in attack rate were marginal. This is again due to a large fraction of children not attending school and the existence of neighbourhood hubs. Similarly, in the rigorous contact reduction scenario the effect of delayed response on attack rate was more pronounced in the Albany model, due to lower effectiveness of interventions in a PNG setting.\" Comment 7: More discussion needs to be made of the interventions. How feasible are they in developing nations?\n\nResponse: All the interventions we used in the present study are based on social distancing. We think that these types of interventions are quite feasible since they are the most cost effective and do not rely on the supply of antiviral drugs. Our view is supported by other studies which have analyzed pandemic influenza preparedness plans for low and medium income countries. These show that a higher proportion of low-income countries have social distancing interventions planned in the case of an outbreak, compared to high income European countries due to their feasibility and costeffectiveness, given that the supply of antiviral drugs will be difficult in developing nations [3, 4] . We have now included additional text in the discussion section of the manuscript regarding the feasibiltity of the interventions we modelled in this study. This text can be found below.\n\n\"The interventions used in the present study are based on social distancing. Surveys have shown that a higher proportion of low-income countries have social distancing interventions planned in the case of a pandemic, compared to high income European countries due to their feasibility and costeffectiveness, given that the supply of antiviral drugs will be difficult in developing nations [4, 8] .\" Comment 8: Introduction: the \"drivers\" of seasonality in the US are not well understood either (p 4, L 27).\n\nResponse: We have clarified our statement. It now reads: \"Furthermore timing and impact of influenza epidemics in tropical regions are more poorly understood than in temperate regions, where they are known to have a well-defined winter season. [16] \" Comment 9: P 6, L 60: \"This mechanism captures the mixing patterns \u2026 allows marketplace contact to be represented.\" needs a citation. It\"s a broad claim that needs to be justified.\n\n\"Census data classified a significant proportion (16.2%) of adults as unemployed and do not attend a designated workplace [17] . Local knowledge indicated that these adults do have daytime contact with others outwith the home, such as working or visiting the two informal markets. To address this feature an additional daytime contact location was introduced, with unemployed adults in each census unit allocated to neighbourhood hubs of 10 individuals. In addition, these hubs also have 25% of all local school age pupils allocated to them, accounting for half of the 50% of school age children which do not attend school.\" Comment 10: Simulation details: How can one infectious introduction per day be justified? It seems arbitrary.\n\nResponse: We have added the following text to the Simulation details in the methods section of the manuscript: \"The seeding assumption of 1 case per day was chosen to reliably begin a local epidemic in every stochastic simulation. Analysis of the low transmissibility scenario shows that seeding at this rate for 7 days results in a sustained epidemic in >97% of the simulation runs and 100% with two weeks of seeding, with higher percentages for the higher transmissibility scenarios. Seeding at this rate is continued throughout the simulation in order to capture the case where an epidemic may be initially suppressed by a rigorous intervention strategy, but may subsequently break out if intervention measures are relaxed.\n\nAfter the beginning of a sustained local epidemic, any subsequent variation in the amount of seeding has very little effect on the progress of the local epidemic, as the number of imported cases is much smaller than those generated by the local epidemic Preliminary analyses with the present model showed that, for the low transmissibility scenario, even if the seeding rate is increased to 5 infections per day, after 7 days the number of infections generated from the self-sustained local epidemic is twice the number of imported infections, and by 14 days local infections outnumber imported infections by a factor of 8.\"\n\nComment 11: The table captions are vague. What exactly are the numbers in Table 2 ?\n\nResponse: We have rephrased the captions in Table 2 . The numbers in Table 2 are the absolute number of infected people per location.\n\nComment 12: Discussion: I\"m not sure what the sentence \"This raises issues regarding how to optimise antiviral delivery and who would fund and manage such a program. If neuraminidase inhibitor antivirals were to be considered, care would need to be taken to understand how reduced efficacy compared to that provided by limited studies [31-33] might impact on the overall effectiveness and cost effectiveness of antiviral-based strategies.\" (P 15, L 18-23) means. \"Reduced efficacy\" of what? How?\n\nResponse: We have rephrased this paragraph to clarify what we mean. This paragraph now reads:\n\n\"Pharmaceutical-based interventions were not considered in this study due to cost and delivery issues found with low-income countries. However, consideration may need to be given to some form of antiviral agent use, possibly for case treatment, given the poor performance of purely social distancing interventions in developing countries as suggested by this study. The advantage of antiviral use is that it may be targetted at reducing within-household transmission, a location of transmission otherwise not impacted by social distancing interventions. The present study shows that larger numbers of transmissions occur within households due to the larger household sizes in developing countries. Furthermore, low-income countries generally have population health profiles not seen in developed countries, including the prevalence of diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV.\n\n[18] Antiviral treatment of influenza cases who are co-infected with such diseases may be an appropriate intervention strategy given the poorer health outcomes which co-morbidity may impose. [7] The provision and use of antiviral agents will have challenges not faced by industrialised countries, due to the cost of providing an antiviral stockpile and subsequent distribution of antivirals in countries which have health systems already stretched to capacity. [19] \"\n\nA contact network is calibrated based on the Demographics data of Madang Town and simulation is done to compared its influenza spread (with the introduction of a new virus strain) with Albany\"s simulation results under different disease transmission scenarios with or without social-distancing interventions. Comparing the disease spread results in these two communities from developed and undeveloped countries through contact-network-based simulation, authors concluded that a moderately transmissible pandemic occurring in developing countries like PNG may be expected to result in a larger illness attack rate compared to that in a developed country setting. The paper is interesting but the authors should address the following points, before the paper can be considered for publication.\n\nComment 1: Population density is an important factor affecting disease spread. Although the population sizes of the two communities are similar, the population density is not clearly stated in this paper. Please add in and discuss it.\n\nResponse: We appreciate the reviewer\"s comment and would like to point out that our model deals with the population density issue in a detailed way by modelling explicit person-to-person contact. The number of contacts is, of course dependent on the population density. Higher population density means larger schools, markets, stores where more people come together. Since we are using realistic sizes of households, workplaces and other meeting places, we have already implicitly incorporated population density directly into the model. We have now added the following text into the methods section \"Contact Network\" explaining this feature of our model: \"The present model captures explicit person-to-person contact. The number of contacts is dependent on the population density.\" Comment 2: The timing of the interventions relative to the outcomes of the epidemic and the duration of such policies are important to assess their effectiveness, especially when there are two or more social-distancing interventions involved. However, authors did not discuss the timing of the interventions. Is there trivial interplay between the policies mentioned in the study? Please address this point.\n\nResponse: We have addressed this comment with our extended sensitivity analysis. In this analysis, we also vary the timing of the interventions. The results can be found in the Supplementary Data File in Tables A5 and A6 . We also discuss them in the \"Sensitivity Analysis\" section of the Results where we added the following text: \"The effect of different probabilities of voluntary withdrawal of symptomatic adults and children is presented in Table A5 . Lower rates of voluntary withdrawal lead to higher attack rates in all three models. Voluntary withdrawal from work or school has a more pronounced effect in the Albany model, again since a significant proportion of children in Madang still transmit through daytime contacts in neighbourhood hubs.\n\nThe effects of variation of the timing of intervention initiation are presented in Table A6 . In the school closure scenario, delayed response had the most severe impact on the attack rates in Albany, whereas for the Madang models the changes in attack rate were marginal. This is again due to a large fraction of children not attending school and the existence of neighbourhood hubs. Similary, in the rigourous contact reduction scenario the effect of delayed response on attack rate was also more pronounced in the Albany model. However in comparison to school closure only, the effect on attack rate in Madang was also increased.\" Comment 3: Since the contact network is un-weighted, I would assume that a social contact within the households is equivalent to a social contact in the neighborhood in terms of disease transmissibility. If so, this would be a crude assumption and has to be explicitly discussed about how this assumption may affect the results shown in the text.\n\nResponse: The reviewer is correct that in order to model different transmission rates for different settings, the force of infection experienced by each individual must differ in each setting (i.e. it must be weighted). We achieve this in our model by adjusting contact parameters to obtain location-specific ratios of transmission, and have calibrated these parameters to match published transmission location data, see below.\n\nOur transmission function, which appears on page 8 of the manuscript, is based on pair-wise contact between two individuals, one who is infectious and one who is susceptible. Our \"force of infection\" parameter \u03b2 adjusts the probability of transmission to reflect alternative attack rates (cf. reproduction number). Differential transmission by location is captured by adjusting contact parameters, that is, who-is-in-contact-with-whom, for contact in schools, large workplaces and in the wider community.\n\nWe have expanded the methods section of the manuscript, giving an outline of the contact and transmission mechanism used, specifically stating the data sets used to calibrate the model to produce location and age specific transmission rates. The following text has been added under \"Contact Network\" in the methods section of the main text: \"The number of contacts made by each individual each day in school, work and community settings were adjusted to reproduce the proportion of cases occurring in different settings as reported by empirical studies, specifically 40% of infections occurred in households, 30% in schools and workplaces, and 30% in the wider community. [20] [21] [22] Contacts within schools and workplaces occurred in fixed-size mixing groups of maximum size 10; within mixing groups contact was assumed to be homogeneous. Community contacts occurred between randomly selected individuals, weighted toward pairs of individuals with nearby households.\" Comment 4: The evaluation of the impact of school closure in mitigating an influenza epidemic might strongly depends by the model assumptions. The coupling effect of workforce closure and school closure should be also evaluated as the compliance rates may vary when implementing them individually or in combination mode. Authors may need to evaluate or discuss this point.\n\nResponse: We have now conducted a sensitivity analysis of compliance with home isolation of children resulting from school closure as well as rigorous social distancing resulting from school closure coupled with workplace closure and community contact reduction. This analysis can be found in the Supplementary Data File. (Table A4 ). The table illustrates that while compliance in the school closure scenario has a profound effect on transmission in the Albany model, it has only a marginal effect in the Madang models. This is because about half of the children in Madang do not attend schools in the model and household sizes are larger. Thus the majority of transmission occurs in household and neighbourhood hubs in the Madang models and less in the wider community. Please see Table 1 in the main text for specific numbers. We have also added more text to the \"Sensitivity Analysis\" part of the manuscript. This text can also be found in our response to Comment 6b of Reviewer 1."}
