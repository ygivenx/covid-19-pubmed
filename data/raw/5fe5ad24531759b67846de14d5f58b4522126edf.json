Let us assume we have m different variants of the pathogen, one wild-type and m \u2212 1 mutants. We denote the basic reproductive number of the wild-type pathogen as R (1) 0 , that of the m \u2212 2 intermediate mutants as R With these assumptions, the probability generating functions, f 1 , f 2 , . . . f m are given by: \n\nUsing Equation 2, the probability of emergence can be easily calculated numerically.\n\nAn intuitive look at the processes we have described can be obtained if we consider the deterministic approximation of the stochastic processes. We first describe the case where a single mutation is required for the evolution of the infection to have R 0 greater than one. The probability of evolution per introduction can be computed from the probability that no evolution occurs. The latter equals (1 \u2212 \u00b5) raised to the power of the number of secondary cases. The number of secondary cases equals the sum of the geometric series\n\n. The probability of evolution thus equals\n\nthe second approximation requiring that there be very few cases when the probability of evolution is small (i.e. \u00b5 << 1 and R (0) 0 is not too close to one).\n\nUnder these conditions a rough estimate of the probability of an epidemic when m mutations are required to progress from an infection with R\n\nThe first term is approximately equal to the probability that the infection with R 2. The probabillity of an epidemic increases with mutation rate and the number of mutations required in a manner described by \u00b5 m\u22121 = \u00b5 n+1 .\n\nIn the model described above mutations only result in secondary infections. The above framework can be extended to consider what happens if mutations result in the \"conversion\" of an infection (with probability \u00b5) from one with R 0 < 1 to one with R 0 > 1. In this case the initial transmission event can convert to one having a higher R 0 . In the case that only one mutation is required for R 0 to exceed 1, the probability of evolution will be approximately\n\nIn this case the probability of emergence is similar when R 0 is close to one but falls only to \u00b5 as R 0 approaches zero."}
