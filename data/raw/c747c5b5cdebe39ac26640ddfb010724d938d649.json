{"title": "A data-driven tool for tracking and predicting the course of COVID-19 1 epidemic as it evolves 2 3 4", "body": "number of infected caused by insufficient test kits, in addition to the history of 96 changing diagnostic criteria. Moreover in practice its peak is often not detected 97 until several weeks after it has occurred. 98 99 Since the maximum of EIC can be located by the zero of its derivative, we propose 100 using a local-in-time metric of N(tp)=R(tp) at the peak of EIC, tp. We demonstrate 101 that for the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, this determination of the turning point is 102 not sensitive to past data problems, including the rather dramatic increase in N(t), 103 on 12 February, when Hubei changed its definition of \"confirmed infected\". Also 104 since it uses the newest diagnostics, with the testing facilities ramped up, hopefully 105 the numbers are more accurate. The turning point is determined by when the red and blue curves cross. 116\n\nInset: For China outside Hubei. 117 118 119 Fig. 1 shows how this turning point is empirically determined using daily time series 120 of reported N(t) and R(t). For China as whole, tp is found to be February 18; for 121\n\nHubei, the province of the epicenter Wuhan, tp is found to be 19 February, and for 122\n\nChina outside Hubei (China exHubei), 12 February, coincidentally on the same day 123 as the Hubei data spike. However there is no such bump in the data outside Hubei, 124 and so is not likely the result of the data artifact. These results, even including that 125 for Hubei, are not affected by the historical data problems because of our local-in- 126 time method for determining the turning point. 127 128 The fact that the turning point for the epidemic in China exHubei occurred earlier 129 than that for Hubei could reveal the effectiveness of the quarantine of Hubei. In 130 Wuhan, with hospitals facing the number of infected far exceeding available hospital 131 beds in the initial period, some infected patients were not adequately isolated. 132\n\nSecondary and tertiary infections might have played a role in delaying the turning 133 point. On the other hand, outside Hubei, hospitals were not as overwhelmed 134\n\nbecause of the strict quarantine placed on Hubei, which drastically reduced the 135 import of the disease originating from Hubei. The infected were better isolated, 136 reducing further spread, and treated in hospitals, resulting in shorter time to 137 recovery (see Table S1 ). 138 139\n\nEIC corresponds to I(t) in the traditional SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) 140\n\nmodel (28) Since the logarithm of NR lies on a straight line passing through the turning point of 202\n\nEIC, it would be interesting to explore if the turning point can be predicted by 203 extrapolation using data weeks before it happened (see Figure S1 ). How far in 204 advance this can be done appears to be limited by the poor quality of the initial data. 205 Fig. 3 February actually gives the correct turning point that would occur one week later. 222\n\nAt the time these predictions are made, the newly infected cases were rising rapidly, 223 by over 2,000 each day, and later by over 14,000. It would have been incredulous if 224 one were to announce at that time that the epidemic would turn the corner a week 225\n\nlater. 226 227\n\nEven with the huge spike for the regions affected by the Hubei's changing of 228 diagnosis criteria, because of its short duration the artifact affects the predicted 229 value by no more than 3 days, and the prediction accuracy soon recovers for China 230 as a whole. For Hubei, the prediction never converges to the true value, but the 231 over-prediction is only 2 days. This smallness of the error is remarkable given that 232 other model predictions differ by weeks or months. 233 234 Table S1 lists the mean and standard deviation of the predictions. For applications 235\n\nto other countries and to future epidemics without a change in the definition of the 236 \"infection\" to such a large extent, we expect even better prediction accuracy. 237 238 239\n\n.

Inferring statistical characteristics of the epidemic 248\n\nInterestingly, the derivative of log N(t) or log R(t) also lies on a straight line, as 249\n\nshown in Fig. 4 (although the scatter is larger as to be expected for any 250 differentiation of empirical data). The positive and negative outliers one day before 251 and after 12 Feb are caused by the spike up and then down, with little effect on the 252 fitted linear trend (but increases its variance and therefore uncertainty). Moreover, 253 the straight line extends without appreciable change in slope beyond the peak of 254 N(t), suggesting that the distribution of the newly infected number is approximately 255\n\nGaussian. For an exponential function, the derivative of its logarithm being a linear 256 function of time is highly suggestive of a general type of distribution including 257\n\nGaussian and Rayleigh. The recovery time T can be determined as t1-t0, where t1 is 258 the peak of R(t) and t0 is the peak of N(t). These two peak times can be obtained by 259 extending the straight line in Fig. 4 to intersect the zero line. This predicted result 260\n\ncan be verified statistically after the fact by the lagged correlation of R(t) and N(t). If 261 the distribution is indeed Gaussian or even approximately so, the slope in Fig. 4  262 would be proportional to the reciprocal of the square of its standard deviation, \u03c3, as:\n\nSimilarly result holds for the daily number of recovered, R(t). 266 267 .

No verification is yet 288 possible as the predicted date has not occurred. At the turning point, the EIC is still 289 at its peak. For the disease to have run its course, and an \"all clear\" declaration can 290 be announced, we require that the newly infected case number to drop to zero, for 291 prediction practice measured by three standard deviations from the peak of N(t). 292\n\nThen we wait for two incubation periods, each 14 days, to pass, before we declare 293 .

Using the inferred disease characteristics in Table S1, our prediction is,  294 for concentrated. This is reflected in the data: \u03c3 for South Korea is only half that of 308\n\nChina, with a more rapid rise and fall of the newly infected. Its data for the newly 309\n\ninfected are probably more accurate compared to other countries in similar stage of 310 the epidemic, due to its massive and speedy (within 6 hours) testing of the 311 population in its \"trace, test and treat\" policy. 312 313\n\nConclusion. 314 We offer an alternative data-driven approach to track and predict the course of the 315 epidemic. Many parameters characterizing an epidemic can be determined from 316 local-in-time data. Validated by real data, we suggest that our approach could be 317\n\napplied not just to the current Covid-19 epidemic, but also generally to future 318 epidemics of low fatality rates. It could also be used as a practical tool for epidemic 319 management decisions such as quarantine institution and medical resource 320 planning and allocations (32-35 where T is the hospital stay period before recovery, with its value governed by the 339 efficacy of the treatment. Using real data, we show that this ratio follows a straight-340 line trend. To explain this intriguing feature, we find theoretical support based on 341\n\nGaussian distributions for the daily new and recovered case numbers. Gaussian 342 distribution is a simple and reasonable form for a distribution that has a single peak, 343\n\nwith rapid rise, plateauing near the peak and then declining rapidly. Later, we will 344 verify using actual data for China that they are indeed very close to Gaussian. In reality, the distribution is only approximately Gaussian, of course. But the 351 approximation is very close for the central part of the distribution near the peak. In 352 fact, central limit theory would favor a Gaussian distribution when the data base is 353 large. 354 355\n\nEmpirically, we find that the \u03c3 value for N(t) and R(t) are close to each other but 356 slight differences exist, as shown in Table S2 . This is to be expected, for even though 357\n\nthe new and recovered case happen in tandem with former leading the latter, the 358 hospital treatment and stay constitute effectively a smoothing filter on N(t) to 359 produce R(t). The hospital process tends to spread the R(t) distribution wider, thus 360\n\n.

Hence. \n\nThe turning point is still determined by log NR=0, yielding a theoretical value of 374\n\ntp=t0+T /2. This theoretical value can be used when the data on R(t) is not available. 375 376\n\nIf the daily data is indeed near Gaussian, then for the daily newly infected cases, we 377\n\nshould have approximately, 378 379\n\nThe same is true for the recovered cases, except with t1 replacing t0 and \u03c3 2 replacing 381 \u03c3 1 . 382 383\n\nImportantly, the real data indeed validate a near-straight line function for NR 384 throughout all phase of the epidemic, and the near-Gaussian distributions for both 385 N(t) and R(t). Straight line functions are easy to extend and making predictions easy 386 and robust. These properties also enable us to infer many of the key statistical 387 .

The 404\n\nlatter, obtained by the intercept of the straight line, is less accurate because of the 405 slope is rather shallow. 406 407 b. Gaussian distribution 408\n\nA Gaussian distribution is completely characterized by the location of the peak and 409 the standard deviation. These quantities are determined from the slopes in Figure 4 , 410\n\nand therefore there are no free parameters. Even without the use of disposable 411 parameters, the fit of Gaussian to the actual distribution is adequate, as can be seen 412\n\nin Figure S3 . The corresponding correlation and Gaussian fits for Hubei province 413 are given in Figures S4 and S5 .\n\nEIC is the accumulated newly infected minus the accumulated recovered. Given the 417 result in a, a simpler calculation can be performed which avoids the early poor data: 418 419\n\nThat is, to find EIC at time t, one only needs to add up the daily newly infected case 421 numbers for a period of T preceding t. This is an almost local-in-time property even 422 for this accumulated quantity. For validation, we estimate the peak of the EIC 423 number on 18 February by computing the sum of daily newly infected case numbers 424\n\nfor 15 days, from February 4 to February 18, which yields an EIC on 18 February of 425 54,747. This is within 10% of the actual number of 57, 805, even after taking into 426 account the deaths (by subtracting the accumulated deaths of 2,004 from our 427 estimate). 428 429 .
