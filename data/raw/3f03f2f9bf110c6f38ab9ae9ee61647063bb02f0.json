{"title": "Spontaneous pathology of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and tamarins (Saguinus oedipus, Saguinus mystax)", "body": "The new world primate family Callitrichidae, including marmosets (Callithrix sp) and tamarins (Saguinus sp), are the smallest NHP. This family is arboreal with claws, and possesses the highest fertility rate of any primate with average litters of two to three offspring [34] .\n\nThe common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has become a popular research model in virology, viral oncology, reproductive physiology, bacterial infectious disease, transplantation immunology, pharmacology, endocrinology, teratology, metabolism, behavior, osteology, autoimmune encephalomyelitis models of multiple sclerosis, stroke, and toxicology [2, 9, 17, 20, 21, 25, 28, 36, 38] . This increase usage is reflected in the literature as there were over 40 times the number of publications involving marmosets in the 1990's\n\nIndividual records were assembled into a Microsoft Office Excel 2003 (Microsoft, 2003) spreadsheet to be sorted to generate tables organized by species, morphological diagnosis, organ systems, and cause of death, to include indications for euthanasia. The, number of male, female mature, immature (<18 months old, marmosets [1] ; <16 months old, tamarins [3] ) and total NHP was identified for each morphologic diagnosis; the tamarin results were also counted by species (SMT, SOT).\n\nThe morphologic lesions, body systems affected, and cause of death for the 129 common marmosets are summarized in Tables 1, 2 and 3. The most common marmoset lesions were dehydration, emaciation, nephritis, colitis, and inanition. The average age of all, mature, and immature common marmosets at necropsy was 3.9 +/-SD 3.1, 5.32 +/-SD 2.66, and 0.45 +/-SD 0.46 years. Three cases of colitis were cultured, yielding one isolate each of Escherichia coli (E. coli), Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Psuedomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruoginosa). The case of nematodisis was caused by the parasite Trichospirura leptostoma (T. leptostoma). Three cases of pneumonia were cultured: two yielded Bordetella bronchiseptica and one E. coli. Three cases of hepatitis were cultured: all yielded P. aeruoginosa.\n\nThe morphologic lesions, body systems affected, and cause of death for the 52 tamarins are summarized in Tables 4, 5 and 6. The most common tamarin lesions were dehydration, ascites, emaciation, congestive heart failure, cardiomegaly, and colitis. The average age of all, mature, and immature tamarins at necropsy was 3.09 +/-SD 3.50, 5.21 +/-SD 3.39 and 0.01 +/-SD .00 years. Four cases of nematodiasis were caused by T. leptostoma and two were suspected to be caused by filaroides. One case of pneumonia was cultured, yielding E. coli. Klebsiella pneumoniae was cultured from a case of peritonitis.\n\nIn both species, dehydration and emaciation were generally considered secondary to other chronic diseases processes, such as colitis, heart failure, lymphosarcoma, and amyloidosis. This explains their high frequency as a morphological diagnosis and their infrequent listing as a cause of death.\n\nWe identified two prior surveys of marmoset pathology conducted approximately 25 years ago. A survey of marmosets from a breeding colony [8] identified Heinz body haemolytic anemia, skeletal muscle myopathy, inflammatory disease of the intestinal tract and chronic colitis, and bacterial infections as the most frequent findings. A similar survey of marmosets used in experimental studies [35] identified chronic colitis, chronic thyroiditis and interstitial mononuclear infiltrates in the kidney as the most frequent findings. Similar to those surveys, nephritis, colitis and enteritis were commonly observed in our colony.\n\nHeinz body haemolytic anemia and skeletal muscle myopathy were uncommon in our animals. This may reflect improvements in diet and husbandry practices over the last 25 years, as these lesions were thought to be a result of a nutritional deficiency involving vitamin E, selenium, and protein [8] . Interestingly, hemosiderosis was still commonly encountered in our marmosets suggesting further dietary modifications are still required. It is likely that the decreased frequency of bacterial infections in our animals is also related to changes in housing and husbandry procedures over the last 25 years.\n\nAmyloidosis only accounted for 3% of marmoset diagnoses, however it was diagnosed in 15 of the 128 animals (12%). This is consistent with a prior study reporting a 17% incidence [26] . As in that study, affected animals in our colony included both immature and mature marmosets.\n\nExtramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) in marmosets has been reported in the liver, adrenal glands, liver, kidney, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes [17, 24, 28] . Although we did not find EMH in the mesenteric lymph nodes, we believe this is the first report of EMH in the lungs.\n\nAlthough endometriosis has been experimentally induced in marmosets [16] , to the best of our knowledge, no spontaneous case has ever been reported in a marmoset.\n\nColitis was the most common cause of death in marmosets, accounting for 22% and 23% of overall and mature marmoset deaths, respectively. Our results were significantly less than the 96% incidence rate reported in a 1998 study [13] . Environmental and dietary changes have been shown to radically alter the rates of colitis in marmoset colonies [23] . Although genetic differences between the colonies can not be excluded, it is possible that marmoset husbandry changes over the last 20 years could account for this difference.\n\nLymphosarcoma has been previously reported in marmosets [30] and was the most common neoplasm and the second most common cause of death in mature marmosets in our colony.\n\nInanition, stillbirths and colitis were the most common reasons for death in immature marmosets in our study, accounting for 61% of immature marmoset deaths. Forty percent of immature marmoset deaths occurred at under one month of age. Our results confirm a prior report that most deaths occur during the first month of life and the most common causes of death are reproductive failures (e.g. abortion, stillbirth) and rearing failure (inanition/ starvation) [21] .\n\nHeart failure was by far the most common cause of death, accounting for 29% and 36% of overall and mature tamarin deaths, respectively. A high incidence of cardiac disease was reported in tamarins exposed to hepatitis A and GB viruses [7, 9, 18] . The authors in those studies believed the lesions were unrelated to the experimental study. Our findings of a high incidence of heart failure in naive tamarins supports their hypothesis. However the characteristic of the heart lesion was different; instead of myocardial fibrosis, we typically encountered a dilated heart (Cardiomegaly) with minimal histologic changes. Interestingly, heart failure in our colony was restricted to SMT, the same species used in these studies. Although fewer numbers of SOT were evaluated in our colony, the only cardiac lesion identified in these animals was one case of hemorrhage.\n\nColitis only accounted for 5% of tamarin diagnoses, however it was diagnosed in 11 of the 52 animals (21%). This was still significantly less than the 73% incidence of colitis cystica profunda reported in a previous survey [18] . Additionally, while there were occasional lesions consistent with colitis cystica profunda, the majority of the colitis diagnoses we observed lacked the herniation through the basement membrane and the mucus-filled cysts characteristic of thet condition.\n\nAtelectasis, stillbirth, heart failure and colitis were the most common reasons for death in immature tamarins in our study, accounting for 64% of immature tamarin deaths. Forty five percent of immature tamarin deaths occurred at under one month of age. Tamarin infant pathology is poorly documented, leaving little published data for comparison.
