{"title": "Molecular basis of binding between novel human coronavirus MERS-CoV and its receptor CD26", "body": "The recent identification of a novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV\u2014which, as of May 15th 2013, had infected 40 patients with a total of 20 fatalities\u2014has drawn worldwide attention as a potential cause of a future pandemic5. Unlike most coronaviruses circulating in humans that only cause mild respiratory illness6, MERS-CoV possibly represents a second reported coronavirus of severely high virulence after SARS-CoV, which caused over 8,000 infection cases globally in 2003, with more than 800 deaths3. The clinical manifestations of MERS-CoV infection include fever, cough, acute respiratory distress syndrome and, in some cases, accompanying renal failure1,2, and are very similar to those caused by SARS-CoV. However, the novel coronavirus diverges from SARS-CoV in genomic sequence, and is much more closely related to the bat-derived HKU4 and HKU5 coronaviruses7,8. Consistent with phylogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV does not use the SARS-CoV receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as its entry receptor9; rather, a recent study showed that it uses human CD26 for this purpose4. CD26 is the third peptidase to be identified as a functional coronavirus receptor, the others being aminopeptidase N (ANPEP, also known as APN and CD13)10,11 and ACE2 (ref. 12).\n\nThe recognition of CD26 by MERS-CoV is mediated by virus surface spike (S) protein4. As with other coronaviruses, the MERS-CoV S protein would be cleaved in host cells into S1 and S2 subunits (Fig. 1a). S1 engages the receptor4 whereas S2, with typical sequence motifs homologous to those identified as the heptad repeats in class I enveloped viruses13,14,15, should mediate membrane fusion. The exploitation of the virus\u2013receptor interaction and thus of the intervention strategies requires an atomic delineation of the receptor-binding properties of S1. On the basis of previous studies, the receptor attachment sites of coronavirus S1 subunits might locate to either the amino-terminal (such as in murine hepatitis virus16) or the carboxy-terminal (such as in, for example, SARS-CoV17 and human coronavirus NL63 (ref. 18)) domain. We therefore tested individually the binding of MERS-CoV S1 and its N- and C-terminal-domain proteins to cell-surface-expressed CD26 molecules. The receptor-binding capacity was attributed to the C-terminal amino acids 367\u2013606 of MERS-CoV S1 (Fig. 1b). We hereby referred to this domain as RBD. The potent interaction between MERS-CoV RBD and CD26 was further demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance assays, in which CD26 binds to MERS-CoV RBD with a dissociation constant (Kd) of about 16.7 nM (Kon, 1.79 \u00d7 105 M\u22121s\u22121; Koff, 2.99 \u00d7 10\u22123s\u22121), but does not bind to the RBD of SARS-CoV (Fig. 1c).\n\nWe crystallized MERS-CoV RBD and solved its structure at a resolution of 2.5 \u00c5 (Supplementary Table 1). Two molecules of essentially the same structure are present in the asymmetric unit. Each molecule contains 208 consecutive density-traceable amino acids from V381 to L588. A Dali19 search within the Protein Data Bank (PDB) revealed clear structural homology between MERS-CoV RBD and SARS-CoV RBD (PDB code, 2DD8; Z score, 15.1). We therefore divided the MERS-CoV RBD structure into two subdomains: a core and an external \u03b2-sheet, using the structure of SARS-CoV RBD as a reference. The core subdomain reveals a five-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet (\u03b21, \u03b23, \u03b24, \u03b25 and \u03b210) in the centre. The connecting helices (four \u03b1-helices: \u03b11\u20134 and two 310-helices: \u03b71 and \u03b72) and two small \u03b2-strands (\u03b22 and \u03b211) further decorate the sheet on both sides, together forming a globular fold. Three disulphide bonds, connecting C383 to C407, C425 to C478, and C437 to C585, respectively, stabilize the core-domain structure from the interior. At the solvent-exposed side, the RBD termini are clinched adjacent to each other (Fig. 2a, b). This subdomain fold is very similar to that of the SARS-CoV RBD core (a root mean squared deviation of 2.79 \u00c5 for 76 C\u03b1 pairs). Superimposition of the two structures reveals a well-aligned centre sheet and homologous peripheral helices and strands, although several intervening loops are observed to exhibit large conformational variance (Fig. 2c).\n\nThe external subdomain of MERS-CoV RBD is mainly a \u03b2-sheet structure with three large (\u03b26, \u03b28 and \u03b29) and one small (\u03b27) strand arranged in an antiparallel manner. It is anchored to the RBD core through the \u03b25/6, \u03b27/8 and \u03b29/10 intervening loops, which touch the core subdomain like a clamp at both the top and bottom positions. Two small 310 helices (\u03b73 and \u03b74) and most of the connecting loops in this subdomain locate on the interior side of the sheet, hence exposing a flat exterior sheet-face to the solvent. Residues C503 and C526 form the fourth disulphide bond, linking the \u03b73 helix to strand \u03b26 (Fig. 2a, b). With no observable structure homology (Fig. 2c), the external subdomains of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV RBDs are topological equivalents, both being present as an \u2018insertion\u2019 between the equivalent core-strands (strands \u03b25 and \u03b210 in MERS-CoV, and \u03b26 and \u03b29 in SARS-CoV) (Supplementary Fig. 1).\n\nTo elucidate the structural basis of the virus\u2013receptor engagement, we further prepared the RBD\u2013CD26 complex by in vitro mixture of the two proteins and then purification on a gel filtration column. Consistent with the high binding affinity between MERS-CoV RBD and CD26, the complex is easily obtainable and stable (Supplementary Fig. 2). The complex structure was solved at 2.7 \u00c5 resolution (Supplementary Table 1) with one RBD binding to a single CD26 molecule in the asymmetric unit. The receptor, as shown in previous reports20,21, is composed of an eight-bladed \u03b2-propeller domain and an \u03b1/\u03b2 hydrolase domain. MERS-CoV RBD binds to the side-surface of the CD26 \u03b2-propeller, recognizing blades IV and V and a small bulged helix in the blade-linker. As for the viral ligand, the entire receptor binding site locates in the external subdomain and to the solvent-exposed sheet-face, qualifying the subdomain as the receptor binding motif (RBM) (Fig. 3a). Overall, engagement of the receptor does not induce obvious conformational changes in RBM, although small structural variance could be observed for the tip-loops. The \u03b72\u2013\u03b14 loop in the RBD core, however, unexpectedly exhibits a large conformational difference between the free and the bounded structures (Supplementary Fig. 3). We believe this is due to a crystal contact present in the free RBD structure, which is interrupted in the complex crystal by the engaging receptor.\n\nCD26 is a type II transmembrane protein. It is present as a homodimer on the cell surface20,21,22. The dimerization of the peptidase relies on broad intermolecule contacts contributed by the hydrolase domain and the extended strands in blade IV of the \u03b2-propeller20,21. A lateral binding of MERS-CoV RBD to CD26 would therefore not disrupt CD26 dimerization. Accordingly, a similar U-shaped CD26 dimer could be generated by symmetry operations of the complex structure. The viral ligand locates at the membrane-distal tip of the dimer, corresponding well to a trans interaction between the virus and the receptor (Fig. 3b). Considering that the RBD N and C termini are on the same side distant from CD26, it is unlikely that the remaining S domains would contact the receptor molecule. The binding mode revealed by the complex structure is also in good accordance with a previous study showing that the virus\u2013receptor interaction is independent of the peptidase activity of CD26 (ref. 4). The bound RBD is far away from interfering with either the substrate/product accessing tunnels or the catalytic centre20,21 (Fig. 3b).\n\nOverall, a surface area of 1203.4 and 1113.4 \u00c52 in CD26 and MERS-CoV RBD, respectively, is buried by complex formation (Fig. 4a). Scrutinization of the binding interface reveals a group of hydrophilic residues at the site, forming a polar-contact (H-bond and salt-bridge) network. These interactions are predominantly mediated by the residue side chains (including RBD Y499 with CD26 R336, N501 with Q286, K502 with T288, D510 with R317, E513 with Q344, and D539 with K267), although CD26 L294 and RBD D510 are observed to contact RBD R542 and CD26 Y322, respectively, through the main-chain oxygen atom (Fig. 4b). In addition, the bulged helix in CD26 properly positions three hydrophobic residues A291, L294 and I295 into close proximity with the RBD amino acids Y540, W553 and V555, forming a hydrophobic centre at the interface (Fig. 4c). Further virus\u2013receptor contacts include V341 and I346 of CD26 packing against P515 and the apolar carbon atoms of R511 and E513 in RBD (Fig. 4d), and a CD26 N229-linked carbohydrate moiety interacting with RBD amino acids W535 and E536 (Fig. 4e). Overall, the virus\u2013receptor engagement is dominated by the polar contacts mediated by the hydrophilic residues, and mutations of those in RBD (six alanine substitutions and one Y499F mutation of the CD26-) completely abrogated its interaction with CD26 (Supplementary Fig. 4). The features of these residue interactions are very similar to those mediating the interaction between adenosine deaminase (ADA) and CD26 (ref. 23). By a pairwise comparison, we unexpectedly found that all those CD26 residues identified in the virus\u2013receptor interface are also involved in ADA binding, indicating a competition between ADA and the virus for CD26 receptor. As the ADA\u2013CD26 interaction is shown to induce co-stimulatory signals in T cells22, this may indicate a possible manipulation of the host immune system by MERS-CoV through competition for the ADA-recognition site. It is also noteworthy that those CD26 residues involved in RBD binding are highly conserved between human and bat, with only two variations (I295T and R317Q), explaining the capability of MERS-CoV using bat CD26 for cell entry4 (Supplementary Fig. 5).\n\nCoronaviruses can be categorized into three main genera or groups (group 1 (alpha), group 2 (beta) and group 3 (gamma) coronaviruses)24. Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV belong to the betacoronavirus genus, but are classified into different lineage subgroups (subgroup 2b for SARS-CoV and 2c for MERS-CoV)8. We noted that the spike sequences are of low identity among different subgroup members. For example, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S proteins show a sequence identity of less than 28%. Nevertheless, RBDs of the two coronaviruses are homologous for the core subdomain. Notably, the three interior disulphide bonds in the core are well-aligned for the steric positions in the two RBD structures and well-conserved in sequence among betacoronaviruses. Conversely, the external RBM region is highly variable in both length and residue composition (Supplementary Fig. 6). Consistently, no structural homology in this subdomain is observed between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Yet it is this subdomain that engages cellular receptors. We therefore assume that betacoronaviruses probably have a similar core-domain fold in the S protein to present the external amino acids with divergent structures for viral pathogenesis, such as receptor recognition.\n\nOur work presents the fifth structure of virus S protein\u2013receptor complexes in the Coronaviridae family16,17,18,25. Taking into account both the RBD structure and the binding mode with receptors, MERS-CoV is related to SARS-CoV17 (a single insertion functioning as RBM) but differs from porcine respiratory coronavirus25 and NL63 (ref. 18) of alphacoronaviruses (multiple discontinuous RBMs) (Supplementary Fig. 7). Nevertheless, related structural topologies can still be observed in RBDs of these coronaviruses26. We noted that in the RBD\u2013receptor complex structures of both MERS-CoV and porcine respiratory coronavirus the binding interfaces involve a receptor N-glycan. This might represent another cross-genus similarity in the Coronaviridae family, which supports a proposed common evolutionary origin of coronavirus S proteins26. It would therefore be interesting to investigate the contribution of the sugar moiety to the virus\u2013receptor interaction for MERS-CoV in the future.\n\nVaccination remains the most useful measure to combat viral infection and transmission. A large number of antibodies show neutralization activity by targeting the RBD and thereby disrupting the virus\u2013receptor engagement. Therefore, a properly folded RBD could be an ideal immunogen for vaccination, as demonstrated for SARS-CoV27. A recent report indeed shows the presence of S-specific neutralizing antibodies in MERS-CoV-infected patients28. It may be worth attempting to test the immunization effect of MERS-CoV RBD in the future.\n\nBoth His-tagged CD26 and MERS-CoV RBD proteins were expressed in insect High Five cells using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). The recombinant proteins were then purified via nickel-chelated affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Crystals were obtained by initial screening with the commercially available kits followed by optimization. The RBD structure was solved by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction and the complex structure by molecular replacement.\n\nThe proteins used for crystallization and surface plasmon resonance experiments were prepared with the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). The coding sequences for MERS-CoV RBD (GenBank accession number JX869059, spike residues 367\u2013606), SARS-CoV RBD (accession number NC_004718, spike residues 306\u2013527), human CD26 (accession number NP_001926, residues 39\u2013766) and human ACE2 (accession number BAJ21180, residues 19\u2013615) were individually cloned into the pFastBac1 vector. For each construct, a previously described gp67 signal peptide sequence29 was added to the protein N terminus for protein secretion, and a hexa-His tag was added to the C terminus to facilitate further purification processes. Transfection and virus amplification were conducted with Sf9 cells, and the recombinant proteins were produced in High Five cells. The cell culture was collected 48 h after infection and passed through a 5-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare). After removal of most of the impurities, the recovered proteins were then pooled and further purified on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). Finally, each collected protein was prepared in a buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl and concentrated to about 10 mg ml\u22121for further use.\n\nTo obtain the complex of MERS-CoV RBD bound to CD26, the individual proteins were in vitro mixed at a molar ratio of 1:1 and incubated at 4 \u00b0C for about 2 h. The complex was then further purified on a Superdex 200 column, and concentrated to about 15 mg ml\u22121 for crystallization experiments.\n\nTo prepare the Fc chimaeric proteins, the fragment encoding MERS-CoV S1 (residues 1\u2013751) or NTD (residues 1\u2013353) or RBD (adding the S residues 1\u201317 of the signal peptide to its N terminus to facilitate protein secretion) was fused 5\u2032-terminally to a fragment coding for the Fc domain of mouse IgG and ligated into the pCAGGS expression vector. A mutant RBD\u2013Fc protein-expressing plasmid was also constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, for which the identified hydrophilic residues involved in CD26 binding were mutated simultaneously (Y499F; N501A, K502A, D510A, E513A, D539A and R542A). The expression plasmids were then transfected into HEK293T cells. The cell culture was collected 48 h after transfection and directly used in the flow cytometric assay.\n\nMERS-CoV RBD, CD26 and their protein complex were individually prepared and adjusted to the same volume. The samples were then loaded onto a calibrated Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). The chromatographs were recorded and overlaid onto each other. The pooled proteins were analysed on a 12% SDS\u2013PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie blue.\n\nThe BiAcore experiments were carried out at room temperature (25 \u00b0C) using a BIAcore 3000 machine with CM5 chips (GE Healthcare). For all the measurements, an HBS-EP buffer consisting of 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA and 0.005% (v/v) Tween-20 was used, and all proteins were exchanged to the same buffer in advance via gel filtration. The MERS-CoV RBD and SARS-CoV RBD proteins were immobilized on the chip at about 500 response units. Gradient concentrations of human CD26 (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640 and 1,280 nM) or human ACE2 (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640 and 1,280 nM) were then used to flow over the chip surface. After each cycle, the sensor surface was regenerated via a short treatment using 10 mM NaOH. The binding kinetics were analysed with the software BIAevaluation Version 4.1 using the 1:1 Langmuir binding model.\n\nFor the surface expression of CD26, the full-length coding sequence was cloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector which yields a plasmid encoding a recombinant CD26 protein with an EGFP-tag fused to its N terminus. The plasmid was transfected into the CD26-negative BHK cells using lipo2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cells were collected 48 h after transfection.\n\nFor staining, the mock-transfected BHK cells or the cells transfected with the CD26-expressing plasmid were suspended in PBS and incubated with the individual Fc-fusion protein culture or goat anti-CD26 IgG (R&D Systems) at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were then washed and further incubated at room temperature for about 0.5 h with anti-mouse or anti-goat secondary IgG antibodies (R&D Systems). After washing, the cells were analysed by flow cytometry with a BD FACSCalibur machine. The cells incubated only with the secondary antibodies were used as the negative controls.\n\nAll the crystals were obtained by vapour-diffusion sitting-drop method with 1 \u03bcl protein mixing with 1 \u03bcl reservoir solution and then equilibrating against 100 \u03bcl reservoir solution at 18 \u00b0C. The initial crystallization screenings were carried out using the commercially available kits. The conditions that yield crystals were then optimized. Diffractable crystals of the free RBD protein were finally obtained in a condition consisting of 0.1 M ammonium tartrate dibasic, pH 7.0, and 12% PEG 3,350 with a protein concentration of 10 mg ml\u22121. Derivative crystals were obtained by soaking RBD crystals for 24 h in mother liquor containing 2 mM KAuCl4\u2022H2O. The complex crystals were grown in 6% (v/v) 2-propanol, 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 4.5 and 26% PEG550 with a protein concentration of 15 mg ml\u22121.\n\nFor data collection, all crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen after a brief soaking in reservoir solution with the addition of 20% (v/v) glycerol. The native RBD data set was collected at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) BL1A (wavelength, 1.03818 \u00c5), whereas the diffraction data for the Au derivative crystal (wavelength, 1.0382 \u00c5) and the complex crystal (wavelength, 0.97930 \u00c5) were collected at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) BL17U. All data were processed with HKL2000 (ref. 30). Additional processing was performed with programs from the CCP4 suite31.\n\nThe structure of RBD was determined by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method. The Au sites were first located by SHELXD32 for the Au-SAD data. The identified position were then refined and the phases were calculated with SAD experimental phasing module of Phaser33. The real space constraints were further applied to the electron density map in DM34. The initial model was built with Autobuild in Phenix package35. Additional missing residues were added manually in Coot36. The final model was refined with phenix.refine in the Phenix35 with energy minimization, isotropic ADP refinement, and bulk solvent modelling. The complex structure was solved by molecular replacement module of Phaser33, with the solved RBD structure and previously reported CD26 structure (PDB code, 2BGR) as the search models. The atomic model was completed with Coot36 and refined with phenix.refine35. The stereochemical qualities of the final models were assessed with PROCHECK37. The Ramachandran plot distributions for the residues in the free RBD structure were 86.8, 11.8 and 1.4% for the most favoured, additionally and generously allowed regions, respectively. These values were 86.5, 13.1 and 0.5% for the RBD\u2013CD26 complex structure. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. All structural figures were generated using Pymol (http://www.pymol.org).\n\nThe secondary structure determination was based on the ESPript38 algorithm."}
