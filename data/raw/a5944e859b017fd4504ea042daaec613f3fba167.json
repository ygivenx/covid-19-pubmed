The obtained 137 rVSIV infections rates, which reflect tibrovirus particle cell entry (host cell susceptibility), 138 indicate that particles of all tibroviruses, not only those of BASV, easily enter a broad range of 139 human and non-human cells. We confirm pH dependency of BASV G-mediated entry, show that 140 tibrovirus particle cell entry is likely dynamin-dependent and cholesterol-independent, and 141 extrapolate these findings to all tibroviruses. Using the four authentic tibroviruses and cross-142 reacting anti-tibrovirus N antibodies in western blots, we demonstrate, however, that many cell 143 lines that are susceptible to tibrovirus G-mediated particle entry are not likely to be permissive to 144 replication of most tibroviruses after particle entry. Kleinfelter et al., 2015) to yield 161 rVSIV-BAV G, rVSIV-BHV G, rVSIV-CPV G, and rVSIV-TIBV G, respectively ( Figure 1A) . 162 The sequences of the G-encoding regions of all created rVISV genomes were confirmed to be 163 identical to those of the respective GenBank accession numbers by Sanger sequencing. Primers 164 were designed to amplify rVSIV-tibrovirus G-encoding regions by RT-PCR, and these fragments 165 were sequenced by Macrogen, Rockville, MD, USA. All rVSIVs were rescued, grown, and were designed using Antigen Profiler software (ThermoFisher Scientific). Two 19-mers were 268 designed, produced, and injected into rabbits by the company. Rabbit sera containing antibodies 269 were harvested and purified by the company 72 days after peptide injection. To detect authentic 270 tibroviruses, virus-exposed cells were harvested and lysed using Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Tris Gels (ThermoFisher Scientific), and gels were run with MOPS SDS Running Buffer 277 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Gels were dry-transferred using the iBlot 2 Gel Transfer Device 278 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Primary antibodies were diluted to 1:1,000; goat anti-rabbit IgG 279 coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Sigma Aldrich) was diluted to 1:3,000.

We then exposed 53 well-characterized human adherent cancer rVSIV-VSIV G control occurs at the VSIV particle entry step and is not due to replication 353 restriction as rVSIVs encoding some non-VSIV Gs were able to replicate in these cells.\n\nTo determine whether tibrovirus Gs also mediate virion entry into nonhuman cell lines, 355 we exposed 11 bat, 5 nonhuman primate, 1 hispid cotton rat, 1 boa constrictor, and 1 Asian tiger This article is a US Government work.

Together, these results indicate that tibroviruses may be able to broadly enter non-human 371 cell lines, but some cell lines (e.g., PESU-B5L and MyDauLu/47.1) may not be permissive to 372 VSIV replication after particle entry.\n\nThe experiments above were performed with high amounts of rVSIVs (MOI = 3) as our 374 primary objective was to determine whether different cells types are absolutely susceptible or 375 resistant to tibrovirus G-mediated particle entry. To determine relative differences, we repeated To determine whether this idea can be extended to tibroviruses, we pretreated 400 Vero cells with CME inhibitors (AP-2-clathrin-coated pit lattice interrupter chlorpromazine or 401 dynamin inhibitors dynasore and dyngo-4a) and infected the cells as described above.

Cultured isolates of BASV, EKV-1, and EKV-2 are not available and, therefore, could 414 not be included in the experiment. 415 The large size of the experiment and the absence of commercially available or generally four tibroviruses in exposed Asian tiger mosquito and Vero cells. As expected, anti-TIBV N 422 antibody detected TIBV in these TIBV-infected cells. Anti-CPV N antibody detected CPV in 423 CPV-exposed Asian tiger mosquito cells but not in Vero cells. Encouragingly, anti-TIBV N 424 antibody also detected BAV (but not CPV and only weakly SWBV), and anti-CPV N antibody 425 also detected SWBV (but not TIBV and only very weakly BAV) ( Figure 5A ). 426 We next exposed all human, bat, nonhuman primate, hispid cotton rat, boa constrictor, (Table   443 2). In nonhuman cell lines, N was undetectable in cell lines that did not develop CPE with the 444 exception of four non-human primate cell lines, which expressed N despite the absence of CPE 445 (Table 3 ). In contrast, CPE and N detection was largely absent in all cell lines infected with The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/507350 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nTibrovirus cell entry 12 some tibroviruses could infect humans. Because BASV was discovered in the serum of a severely ill individual, tibroviruses should be considered potential human pathogens for 459 surveillance purposes until this hypothesis is ruled out.\n\nIn this initial study, we aimed to comprehensively characterize the host and cell type This article is a US Government work.

We measured N expression only at one timepoint due to the scale of the 502 experiment, and we were unable to carefully quantify the titer and infectious-to-noninfectious 503 particle ratios for the cell infection experiments. Hence, lack of N detection could be due to 504 delayed or slow replication, whereas N detection could be partially due to detection of N 505 stemming from incoming virions rather than from newly made transcripts. Second, the passaging 506 histories of all isolated tibroviruses used in our study are complex, involving cells and animals of 507 different species (Table 1) (Figures 2 and 3) . This result is somewhat puzzling as the Together, the data obtained during our study indicate that tibrovirus tropism evaluations 527 using tibrovirus surrogate systems (such as pseudotyped VSIVs or rVSIVs) should not be 528 interpreted as indicative of the actual ability of a tibrovirus to infect, for instance, humans.\n\nHowever, these studies will be useful to further evaluate the general entry mechanism of 530 tibroviruses, including, for instance, the identification of (the) tibrovirus cell surface receptor(s), 531 which appear to be rather ubiquitously expressed. To evaluate the pathogenic potential of alleged 532 human tibroviruses such as BASV, EKV-1, and EKV-2, replicating isolates will have to be 533 obtained either by means of isolation from a natural host reservoir or vector or by means of 534 reverse genetics. \n\nThis article is a US Government work.
