{"title": "The abatement of major pollutants in air and water by environmental catalysis", "body": "Environmental protection is directly related to the sustainable development of economies and society. The control of the emission of major air and water pollutants remains a daunting challenge in China. The removal of major air pollutants (PM, SO 2 , NO x , Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and Hg) from stationary and mobile sources is becoming increasingly urgent for the improvement of air quality, and the removal of thousands of industrial and natural chemical compounds from contaminated water systems is also critical to maintain the availability of clean water. Therefore, cost-effective and appropriate air-pollution-control and water-treatment technologies must be explored and implemented.\n\nTo date, some technological options exist to control air pollution and wastewater; however, the most efficient method is based on the principle of environmental catalysis. In this paper, the development of control technologies for environmental catalysis for air-pollution control and wastewater treatment is reviewed, and the abatement mechanism of air and water pollutants via catalysis is discussed.\n\n2 Removal of NO x and Hg in flue gas by catalysis Air pollutants, such as NO x and Hg, are mainly emitted from stationary sources, and the technology for control of their emissions can be grouped into source control and end control. The environmental catalysis method is the most efficient way to remove NO x in end-control technology. For example, the SCR of NO x with a reductant (typically NH 3 ) into water and nitrogen is an available method over a special catalyst, which is the key factor in achieving highly efficient NO x conversion. stability [2] , and TiO 2 serves as a support. In past decades, numerous other formulations have been developed for the SCR reaction. Because vanadium species are poisonous to humans and to the environment, numerous researchers have contributed to the development of non-vanadium SCR catalysts.\n\nAt present, numerous transition metals have been reported to be active in NO x reduction, including TiO 2supported V 2 O 5 , Fe 2 O 3 , CuO, MnO x and CeO x catalysts [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Among metal oxides, pure V 2 O 5 and V 2 O 5 supported on oxide carriers (Al 2 O 3 , SiO 2 , ZrO 2 , TiO 2 , etc.) have been extensively investigated. Metal oxides supported on active carbon have been proposed as a competitive choice compared with the available catalysts because of its economic efficiency. Studies have shown that metal oxides that are active as oxidation catalysis could mostly serve as an active component in the SCR reaction.\n\nIn most cases, NH 3 is used as the reductant in commercial SCR plants. In the presence of O 2 , NH 3 reacts with NO x to form water and nitrogen according to the general reactions:\n\nIn practice, the following side reactions can also occur:\n\nIf SO 2 and H 2 O are present in the combustion gases, the following reactions are possible over the catalyst: \n\nEven small amounts of SO 2 and H 2 O are highly undesirable because they cause the deposition and accumulation of ammonium sulfate salts on the catalyst (if the temperature of the catalyst is not sufficiently high) and on the air-pre-heater downstream from the catalytic reactor.\n\nAcidity and redox properties are both considered to be important parameters for SCR catalysts. Tops\u00f8e et al. [11] proposed the mechanistic scheme shown in Fig. 1 . In this mechanism, the catalytic performance is related to the NH 3 adsorbed on the Br\u00f8nsted acid sites associated with V 5+ -OH sites. The catalytic cycle consists of both acid-base and redox reactions.\n\nAlthough SCR technology based on vanadia catalysts has been introduced into the market for the removal of NO x from flue gas, some problems still remain due to the toxicity of active vanadium, the significant amount of N 2 O formed at high temperatures, and the high activity toward the oxidation of SO 2 to SO 3 [12] . Low-temperature SCR (LT-SCR) catalysts, which can work well at approximately 250\u00b0C or at even lower temperatures and allow the SCR unit be placed behind the desulfurizer in a power plant, have attracted much attention in the academic and industrial field. Hence, many researchers continue to develop new LT-SCR catalysts. The development of this type of catalyst has been well summarized in a recent review [13] . Some vanadium free transition-metal-based oxide catalysts, such as FeTiO x [14] , CuO x /WO x -ZrO 2 [15] , WO 3 /CeO 2 -ZrO 2 [16] and Ce/TiO 2 [17, 18] , have also been reported as potential substitutes of vanadium-based catalysts. Recently, Ce-W-Ti and Ce-W mixed oxide catalysts, which showed excellent NH 3 -SCR activity and high N 2 selectivity over a wide range of operating temperatures and extremely high resistance to space velocity have been reported [19, 20] .\n\nThe development of LT-SCR catalysts for the removal of NO x by NH 3 is still a substantial challenge, especially at temperatures less than 200\u00b0C. According to the literature, many catalysts that contain transition metals (such as Fe, V, Cu or Mn) exhibit low-temperature SCR activity, among which, the MnO x catalyst has demonstrated excellent lowtemperature performance and has been researched extensively [21] . 1 Mechanistic scheme of the catalytic cycle of the SCR reaction over the V 2 O 5 /TiO 2 catalyst in the presence of oxygen [11] Kijlstra [22] has reported that the conversion rate of NO x is 72% over a MnO x /Al 2 O 3 catalyst at 150\u00b0C; however, the catalyst is not stable. In the first 50 h, the conversion rate decreases rapidly and later gradually becomes steady at approximately 40%. The preparation method affects the activity of Mn-based catalysts. Tang et al. [23] investigated manganese oxide catalysts prepared using different methods and found that the crystallinity of MnO x was affected by the preparation method. MnO x with lower crystallinity, such as MnO x (SP, solid-phase reaction method) and MnO x (CP, co-precipitation method), exhibited higher activity at low temperatures. The specific surface area and oxidation state of the Mn in MnO x are both correlated to the SCR activity to some extent [24] .\n\nThe MnO x -CeO 2 catalyst has been investigated extensively because of its superior performance [25, 26] . Qi et al. [25] found that the Mn/(Mn + Ce) molar ratio and calcination temperature influence the activity significantly. The results suggested that the reaction was zero order with respect to NH 3 and first order with respect to NO over this catalyst. The addition of Fe, Zr [27] or Nb [28] would improve the low-temperature activity and N 2 selectivity.\n\nVarious support materials have been employed in LT-SCR catalysis. They can be divided into metal oxides, carbon materials and zeolites. The dispersion of active sites depends on the concentration of the precursor solution, the method by which the metal is introduced, and the final procedure of drying [29] . All of these factors correlate to the structure and performance of the catalyst. The development of this type of catalyst has been well summarized in a recent review [24] .\n\nWith respect to the LT-SCR reaction, many researchers have proposed that NH 3 is adsorbed onto a Lewis acid center and that intermediates such as NH 2 The effects of water vapor can be divided into reversible and irreversible effects. Co-adsorption with NH 3 or NO on the active sites is considered to be an important factor with respect to H 2 O, which influences the catalytic activity and the light-off temperature. For the SCR of NO x by NH 3 in the absence of SO 2 , the effect of H 2 O is not severe at high temperatures. However, the more direct participation of water in the mechanism of the DeNO x reaction should be studied in the future.\n\nWhen H 2 O and SO 2 coexist, SO 2 can be oxidized to SO 3 and further oxidized to H 2 SO 4 and sulfates with SCR catalysts. The effect of SO 2 originates from two aspects: 1) corrosion of pipes and plants downstream by SO 3 , which is generated from SO 2 oxidation; 2) covering of the active sites by metal sulfates and ammonium sulfates [22] . This second effect is regarded as the main reason for the decrease in SCR activity. . The mechanism of SO 2 oxidation is not sensitive to the synergy of the surface metal oxide species [33] . The content of V 2 O 5 is usually kept low (less than 2 wt. %) because it is active not only in the SCR reaction but also in the oxidation of SO 2 [34] .\n\nSulfate species, which can be produced from SO 2 oxidation, played dual roles with respect to catalytic activity, which depends on temperature. At temperatures greater than 300\u00b0C, catalytic activity is generally enhanced because of the enhanced intensity of Br\u00f8nsted acid sites by the adsorbed sulfate species. At temperatures less than 200\u00b0C, the formation of metal sulfates leads to a disruption of the redox properties between active sites [35] . The accumulation of sulfate species on the catalyst surface will lead to the irreversible destruction of the surface catalytic centers involved in the oxidation of NO to NO 2 [36] . The catalytic activity decreased rapidly in the presence of SO 2 . In the temperature range of 200\u00b0C-300\u00b0C, both roles of sulfate exist, and the effect of sulfation depends on the catalyst morphology and the mechanism of SCR reaction.\n\nNumerous components, such as Cu and Fe, were found to be effective to improve the SO 2 resistance of SCR catalysts compared to that of the Mn-based catalyst [37] [38] [39] . The addition of an additive, such as by the doping of SnO 2 [26, 40] , is another way to possibly solve this problem, and this approach resulted in an enhanced activity at low temperature and increased N 2 selectivity. 2 and a major concern to the industrial utilization of SCR catalysts. The deposition of these species can significantly reduce the SCR performance and limit the catalyst's lifetime.\n\nThe effect of alkali metals on traditional V 2 O 5 -WO 3 / TiO 2 catalysts has been widely studied, and the deactivation is attributed to the decreased acidity of the catalysts [46] . Kamata et al. [47] have studied the effect of K 2 O on the traditional catalyst and proposed that the potassium oxide partially reacted with V 2 O 5 to form KVO 3 . Khodayari et al. [41, 48] reported that potassium retarded the redox potential of the surface vanadia species and decreased the amount of NH 3 adsorbed: the amount of NH 3 (ad) bound to the Br\u00f8nsted-acid sites decreased with increasing potassium content of the catalyst, whereas the amount of NH 3 (ad) adsorbed onto the Lewis-acid sites was nearly unchanged. Lisi et al. [43] proposed that K and Na did not cause a loss of surface area but rather caused a significant decrease in the surface acidity. Zheng et al. [42] studied the deactivation effect of potassium in the form of both chloride and sulfate on the SCR catalysts and found that potassium titrated the active sites for NH 3 adsorption and that simply increasing the reaction temperature or the vanadium content cannot effectively compensate the loss of activity. Catalysts with high vanadium content become active for the oxidation of NH 3 , which causes a net NO formation. Kr\u00f6cher and coworkers [44] reported that the poisoning elements potassium and calcium occupied the non-atomic hole sites of the (010) V 2 O 5 surface such that both Br\u00f8nsted acid and V 5+ -O sites were blocked. Klimczak et al. [45] proposed that, in addition to the deactivation by potassium, sodium, manganese and calcium, phosphate is also a strong deactivating component. Though doping of phosphorus on the catalyst surface could increase the acidity of the catalyst, the formation of phosphate results in a decreased catalytic surface due to pore blocking. All these studies have primarily focused on the effects of the surface acidity with decreasing SCR activity, and few reports have been devoted to the effects on other properties. Tang et al. [49] reported that the redox property (reducibility) could be another key factor for the poisoning effect of alkali metals over V 2 O 5 /TiO 2 based on the doping of sodium and calcium ions. Chen et al. [50] proposed that surface-chemisorbed oxygen could also be reduced and that the downward trend was in good agreement with the SCR activity. With respect to theoretical calculations, Calatayud et al.\n\n[51] investigated the stability and reactivity of the V 2 O 5 (110) and (001) surfaces using the density functional theory (DFT) method. Moreover, they studied the effect of alkali doping on the V 2 O 5 /TiO 2 catalyst model and concluded that the dopant atoms significantly affect the V = O groups. Recently, Peng and Li et al. employed a combination of experimental and theoretical methods to elucidate the mechanism of the alkali metal deactivation of the CeW catalyst in SCR reactions [52] . They found that the decreases in the reducibility and the quantity of Br\u00f8nsted acid sites were responsible for the catalyst deactivation and that the acid strength was not significantly influenced by the alkali metal. DFT calculations revealed that Na and K could easily adsorb onto the CeW (110) surface and that the surface oxygen could migrate to cover the active tungsten. More importantly, the CeW catalyst exhibited better resistance to alkali metal poisoning compared with that of the traditional V 2 O 5 /TiO 2 catalyst, and hot-water washing was found to be a convenient and effective method to regenerate alkali metal poisoned CeW catalysts.\n\nMercury is an important air pollutant because of its toxic effects on the environment and human health, its persistence in the environment, and its global transport in air masses. Coal-fired utility boilers are currently the largest single known source of anthropogenic mercury emissions. The emission of mercury from coal-fired plants is a serious concern in both developed and developing countries [53] . Elemental mercury is the major species emitted in the flue gas from coal-fired utilities [54] . Thus far, the most promising and cost-effective technology for the control of elemental mercury emissions is the cobenefit of the SCR unit [55] . Gaseous elemental mercury can be catalytically oxidized to gaseous HgCl 2 via a SCR catalyst using HCl in the flue gas as the oxidant. The formed HgCl 2 can then be efficiently captured by wet fluegas desulfurization (FGD) systems [56] .\n\nLaboratory, pilot and field tests verify that a commercial SCR catalyst (V 2 O 5 -WO 3 /TiO 2 ) can oxidize elemental mercury to HgCl 2 in the presence of HCl [57, 58] . However, without HCl, the ability of a commercial SCR catalyst for the transformation of elemental mercury is very poor. Ammonia, which is necessary for NO x control, is a severe interferent for elemental mercury oxidization [59] . Alkali and alkaline-earth metals (Na, K, Mg and Ca) show an obvious deactivation for the oxidation of gaseous elemental mercury on a V 2 O 5 -WO 3 /TiO 2 catalyst [60] . Furthermore, some other SCR catalysts, such as V 2 O 5 / TiO 2 [57] , CeO 2 /TiO 2 [35, 61] , Fe-Ti spinel [62] , Fe-Ti-V spinel [63] and CeO 2 -WO 3 /TiO 2 [64, 65] , have shown excellent ability to oxidize elemental mercury. Recently, the commercial SCR catalyst has been modified by RuO 2 to suppress the interference of NH 3 . Although a RuO 2modified commercial SCR catalyst shows better efficiency for elemental mercury oxidization and excellent antideactivation ability for NH 3 , its SCR activity obviously decreases at high temperatures because of the overoxidization of NH 3 .\n\nLow-temperature SCR catalysts are extremely restricted in their application due to the deposition of ammonium bisulfate [66] . The installation of the SCR catalyst downstream from the particulate control device specifically for the purpose of elemental mercury oxidation may be an economical choice because better mercury conversion can be achieved [55] . Therefore, numerous lowtemperature SCR catalysts, such as MnO x /TiO 2 [67] , Mn-Fe spinel [62] , Fe-Ti-Mn spinel [32] and MnO x /Al 2 O 3 [68] , have been investigated for elemental mercury oxidization. The chemical adsorption of elemental mercury and elemental mercury oxidization is difficult to discriminate on low-temperature SCR catalysts.\n\nThe L-H mechanism, the E-R mechanism, and the Mars-Maessen mechanism have been employed to describe the reaction mechanism of the heterogeneous oxidization of elemental mercury on SCR catalysts (shown in Fig. 2 ). Elemental mercury first adsorbs onto the SCR catalyst, and the adsorbed elemental mercury subsequently reacts with gaseous HCl to form gaseous HgCl 2 , which is the E-R mechanism [69] . In the L-H mechanism, both gaseous elemental mercury and HCl adsorb onto the SCR catalyst, and then the adsorbed elemental mercury reacts with adsorbed HCl to form HgCl 2 [70] . On some SCR catalysts, gaseous elemental mercury may compete with gaseous HCl for the adsorption sites. In the Mars-Maessen mechanism, elemental mercury first adsorbs onto the SCR catalyst, and the adsorbed elemental mercury is then oxidized by the lattice oxygen on the SCR catalyst to form HgO/Hg 2 O, and the HgO/Hg 2 O can react with gaseous HCl or adsorbed HCl to form HgCl 2 [71] .\n\nTo date, none of these mechanisms has been verified as the dominant mechanism for catalytic mercury oxidation. If the SCR catalyst undergoes changes or if the reaction temperature varies, the mechanism for elemental mercury oxidization may be different. Furthermore, these mechanisms have been used to interpret the interference of SO 2 and NH 3 with elemental mercury oxidization over the SCR catalyst. Gaseous NH 3 may compete with elemental mercury for the adsorption sites, which would result in an obvious interference with elemental mercury oxidization [56] . SO 2 can react with the SCR catalyst and result in the sulfation of the SCR catalyst. The adsorption of elemental mercury and/or HCl onto the SCR catalyst may be restrained due to the sulfation. Furthermore, gaseous SO 2 may compete with elemental mercury and/or HCl for the adsorption sites [72] . As a result, SO 2 generally shows a remarkable interference with elemental mercury oxidization.\n\nAmong the new emerging SCR systems for automotive NO x control, many efforts have been focused on metalpromoted zeolites. Many ion-exchange zeolites have been reported to be active in the NH 3 -SCR reaction. Among this wide family of catalysts, iron and copper zeolites appear to be particularly interesting and have been extensively studied.\n\nMetal-exchanged zeolites have been proven to be active SCR catalysts with broad operation-temperature windows [73] . Among these catalysts, Cu-and Fe-based zeolites are the most attractive catalysts for NH 3 -SCR and have been extensively studied [73, 74] . Cu-ZSM-5 and Cu-BETA are known to exhibit excellent low-temperature activity in this reaction. Isolated Cu 2+ and Cu-O-Cu dimeric species are generally recognized to play key roles in the NH 3 -SCR reaction, and the redox cycle between Cu 2+ and Cu + is important [75, 76] . However, Cu-ZSM-5 and Cu-BETA demonstrate a lack of hydrothermal stability at temperatures greater than 700\u00b0C. The change of oxidation state of copper during aging (the decrease of the Cu + species and/or agglomeration of Cu species) and the destruction of zeolite structure have been suggested to be the main reasons for hydrothermal deactivation. Fe-exchanged zeolites, especially Fe-ZSM-5, have been proven to be active catalysts for the NH 3 -SCR of NO x [73, 77] . The NH 3 -SCR activity of Fe-ZSM-5 can be affected by numerous parameters, including the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite, the degree of ion exchange and the preparation method [77] [78] [79] [80] . The Fe species on Fe-ZSM-5 are generally distinguished as isolated Fe 3+ , oligomeric Fe x O y clusters and Fe 2 O 3 particles [77] [78] [79] [80] . The contribution of different Fe species on Fe-ZSM-5 to SCR activity has been suggested to strongly depend on reaction temperature; however, isolated Fe 3+ species should be the active sites for low-temperature SCR reactions. The limited hydrothermal stability of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts is also one of the challenges for practical applications [81, 82] . Hydrothermal aging is known to lead to the dealumination of zeolite frameworks, the migration of Fe ions to form Fe x O y clusters and a decrease of Br\u00f8nsted acidity.\n\nRecently, Cu-chabazite SCR catalysts (Cu-CHA), including Cu-SSZ-13 and Cu-SAPO-34 with high deNO x efficiency, have been reported [83, 84] . The CHA zeolite contains small-sized pores, which can coordinate isolated mononuclear Cu 2+ species, and the CHA zeolite has shown excellent low-temperature NH 3 -SCR activity and high resistance to hydrothermal aging and hydrocarbon poisoning. Further research has demonstrated that Cu-CHA catalysts can withstand severe hydrothermal aging conditions at 800\u00b0C for 16 h, which compares well with a vehicle-aged catalyst used for a 135,000 miles [85] . Attractively, the Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst still exhibited excellent N 2 selectivity with little N 2 O produced, even though a significant amount of NO 2 existed in the feed gas [86] . All of these advantages indicate that the Cu-CHA is a promising catalyst for the DeNO x process from diesel exhaust. More recently, a one-pot synthesis method with a significantly lower cost was designed for the preparation of Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst, which would be beneficial to the industrial application of Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst [87] .\n\nWith respect to Fe-zeolite catalysts, research results have shown that low iron loadings and low calcination temperatures resulted in mostly iron monomers, especially for the ion-exchanged samples [80, 89] . In contrast, a mixture of monomers, oligomers and hematite particles was formed at intermediate to high loadings. Heating in this gas mixture gave a distinct correlation between the catalytic performance and the oxidation state of iron, which is more pronounced in the catalysts where mostly iron monomers are present. The Fe/HBEA catalysts have been recently developed for the NH 3 -SCR reaction. Its possible mechanism in the so-called standard SCR reaction was elucidated by Klukowski, which is shown in Fig. 3 [90] . Their results suggested a dual-site mechanism, which implies that the NO and NH 3 adsorb and react on neighboring Fe 3+ sites and that NH 3 undergoes several adsorption/desorption cycles on the substrate before adsorbing and reacting on the Fe 3+ sites. The uptake of NH 3 results in the partial reduction of Fe 3+ sites, which are finally recycled by O 2 . However, some contribution from a single-site mechanism cannot be completely ruled out. SCR reaction mechanisms over zeolites at low temperatures have been summarized elsewhere [13] .\n\nAmong the NO x reduction technologies developed for the control of diesel engine emissions, the selective catalytic reduction by hydrocarbon (HC-SCR) approach has attracted attention as a possible alternative to the NH 3 urea-SCR reaction [91, 92] . The distinct advantage of HC-SCR is that the on-board fuel can be used as a reductant for NO x conversion, which reduces the cost involved in the development of infrastructure for delivering reductant to an automotive engine exhaust system. Numerous catalysts, such as zeolite oxides, basic oxide/metal and noble-metal catalysts have been found to be effective for the HC-SCR of NO x by CH 4 , C 2 H 2 , C 2 H 5 OH in the presence of excess oxygen [92] [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] . Among them, Ag/Al 2 O 3 is known as one of the most effective catalysts for HC-SCR [98] [99] [100] . When using oxygenated hydrocarbons as reductants, particularly ethanol, Ag/Al 2 O 3 shows high activity even in the presence of SO 2 and H 2 O [101] .\n\nTo improve the overall performance of Ag/Al 2 O 3 for NO x reduction, numerous researchers have focused on the relationship between the structural features of Ag/Al 2 O 3 catalysts and their catalytic activity for the SCR of NO x . NO x reduction is widely accepted as being strongly correlated to the silver loading. Structural characterization, particularly by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, identified that oxidized silver was predominant on Ag/Al 2 O 3 catalysts with moderate silver loadings, whereas metallic silver clusters (Ag n 0 ) became dominant on high-silver-content alumina catalysts [100, [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] . In general, oxidized silver present as isolated Ag + cations and/or oxidized silver clusters (Ag n \u03b4+ ) on the Al 2 O 3 surface are responsible for the HC-SCR reaction, whereas metallic silver clusters are responsible for the direct combustion of hydrocarbons.\n\nThe structure of hydrocarbons is widely accepted as strongly influencing the activity of Ag/Al 2 O 3 for NO x reduction [91, 92] . The oxygenated hydrocarbons, such as ethanol, acetaldehyde, and propyl alcohol, exhibit excellent NO x reduction activity on Ag/Al 2 O 3 . Thus, elucidation of the intrinsic property responsible for the NO x reduction by oxygenated hydrocarbons may provide a guideline for the development of a HC-SCR system with high efficiency for NO x reduction. During the partial oxidation of ethanol and the reduction of NO x with ethanol over Ag/Al 2 O 3 , large amounts of surface enolic species were observed by He and coworkers [92, 108, 109] . The surface enolic species exhibited much higher activity than did acetate in reactions with nitrate and/or NO + O 2 to form-NCO species, which demonstrates its crucial role in the SCR of NO x by ethanol. Further studies have determined that enolic species also play a key role in the reduction of NO x by other alcohols (1-propanol, isopropyl alcohol, 1-butanol, sec-butyl alcohol, and isobutyl alcohol) over Ag/Al 2 O 3 [110] [111] [112] [113] , acetaldehyde over both Ag/Al 2 O 3 [108] and Co/Al 2 O 3 [114] , and acetylene over ZSM-5 [115] . Interestingly, enols have been demonstrated to be the common intermediates in hydrocarbon oxidation [116] . More recently, Yan et al. [117] found that the enolic species that originate from the partial oxidation of ethanol over Ag/Al 2 O 3 prefer to adsorb onto or close to silver sites, in intimate contact with the active phase. This adsorption behavior of this enolic species contributes to its high activity for the formation of isocyanate species (-NCO) and the final product, N 2 , during the NO x reduction by ethanol over Ag/Al 2 O 3 . These results strongly suggest that adsorbed enolic species and/or enols in the gas phase are the important intermediates involved in the HC-SCR of NO x .\n\nFor decades, researchers have been committed to the Fig. 3 Scheme of the proposed mechanism of the standard SCR reaction on Fe/HBEA zeolite [90] development of new technologies to eliminate NO x emissions from lean-burn exhaust. One of the promising solutions is the use of NO x storage reduction (NSR, also known as lean NO x trap (LNT) catalysts) [118] . The NSR catalyst, which was first developed by the Toyota Company, usually contains noble metals (Pt, Pd or Rh), alkali or alkaline-earth metals (e.g., Ba), and a highsurface-area support. This catalyst is supposed to reduce NO x emissions under a cyclic lean/rich mode for diesel or lean-burn gasoline engines. In the operation of a typical lean engine, NO is oxidized to NO 2 over noble metals and is then stored as nitrites and/or nitrates on the storage components of the catalysts [119, 120] . After the engine is periodically switched to fuel-rich conditions, the absorbed NO x is released and reduced to N 2 by hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons.\n\nMost previous studies have focused on catalyst compositions that strongly affect the storage and reduction of NO x [121] . Commonly, Al 2 O 3 has been used as the support for NSR catalysts because of its high surface area. Recent studies have reported that CeO 2 exhibits certain advantages, particularly in relation to its good oxygen storage capacity and its ability to maintain a high dispersion of noble metals and improve the water-gas shift reaction [122] . With respect to Ba-containing catalysts, the noble-metal species and their dispersion have been reported to lead to different NO oxidation activity in the lean phase [119] , which directly influences subsequent adsorption onto Ba sites. Furthermore, Ba sites located in proximity to Pt are generally accepted as playing an important role during the trapping process. A spill-over mechanism has been proposed to explain such promising effects, which indicates that both oxygen and NO/NO 2 could easily migrate from Pt sites to nearby Ba sites and thus improve the adsorption efficiency [123] . Recently, a Pt/Co/Ba/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was developed by Wang et al. [124] , on which an intimate contact of Co with Ba/Al provides more active sites for NO adsorption, oxidation and desorption. As a result, the Pt and Co co-supported catalysts show better NO x storage and reduction performance and higher N 2 selectivity compared to the traditional Pt-supported Ba/Al 2 O 3 catalyst. VOCs are major contributors to air pollution because of their toxicity to human health and their involvement in the formation of photochemical smog. VOCs pollution derives mainly from emissions of industrial processes and automobile exhausts [125] . With increasingly stringent environmental regulation, the development of effective methods to control VOCs emissions is urgently needed. Numerous different methods are available to control VOCs emissions, and each method has practical limitations for different organic compounds, concentrations, and emission sources [126] . One of the most effective and economically feasible VOCs removal technologies is the catalytic oxidation method [127] because catalytic oxidation can operate with dilute VOCs effluent streams ( < 1% VOCs) and at much lower temperatures than conventional thermal incineration; the catalytic oxidation method therefore does not produce undesirable by-products, such as dioxins and NO x . In addition, catalytic oxidation targets the destruction of pollutant compounds rather than transferring the pollutant to another phase, which is the case for condensation and adsorption technologies and is a drawback unless the recycling of VOCs present in high concentrations is a consideration.\n\nThe development of noble-metal catalysts and transition-metal oxides for the catalytic oxidation of VOCs has been widely explored for both halogenated and nonhalogenated compounds [128, 129] . The noble-metal-based catalysts, despite their higher costs, are preferred because of their high specific activity, their resistance to deactivation and their ability to be regenerated [130] . The catalytic performance of supported noble metals strongly depends on the preparation method, the type of precursor, he metal loading and particle size, and the nature of the support [131, 132] . Moreover, the operating conditions used, such as concentrations of VOCs and oxygen, the overall gas flow rate, and the type of reactor (fixed-bed catalytic reactor or flow-through membrane reactor) also strongly influence the catalytic performance [133, 134] . Pt-and Pdbased catalysts exhibit low light-off temperatures in the oxidation of hydrocarbons and other organic chemicals [130, 135] and therefore are used extensively as active components in industrial catalytic formulations for the conversion of VOCs emitted from stationary and vehicle sources [136, 137] . The activity of Pd is generally better than that of Pt in the conversion of methane; however, its activity is lower in the transformation of other organic compounds [138] . The resistance of Pd to thermal and hydrothermal sintering is also better than that of Pt; however, its behavior in the presence of poisons, such as sulfur-containing pollutants, is worse [130] . The catalytic activity of Pd-based catalysts is closely related to the state of the Pd species, their particle size, and their morphology [139] ; therefore, the catalytic behaviors of Pd catalysts have been widely investigated. Pd species on catalyst surfaces are widely accepted as being divisible into three groups: the metallic (Pd 0 ) state, the oxidized state (PdO) and a mixture of both states (Pd 0 /PdO), depending on the catalytic process [140] . Disagreement still remains as to which Pd state is active for the catalytic oxidation of VOCs; related factors include the structures of the VOCs, the reaction temperature and the nature of the catalyst carrier [141, 142] .\n\nThe industrial application of Pt-and Pd-based catalysts for VOCs control is still limited by cost and sensitivity to poisoning by chlorine/chloride products during the oxidation of chlorinated VOCs [127, 143] . Thus, non-noblemetal oxide catalysts have been developed as low-cost alternatives to the Pt-and Pd-based catalysts. Substantial effort has been made to improve the oxidation activity and resistance to poisoning of metal oxide catalysts, including CoCrO x [144, 145] , MnCoO x [146] , InSnO x [147] , MnCeO x [148] [149] [150] , MnCuO x [151] , NiCoO x mixed oxides [152] , Ce-doped ZrO 2 [153] , Mn-doped ZrO 2 [154] and MnO x /TiO 2 -CNTs [155] . In recent years, the influence of the structure of metal oxide catalysts on activity has been reported, and catalysts prepared with ordered meso-structures exhibited better activity than bulk catalysts with non-meso-structures [156, 157] . Different preparation methods for mixed-metal oxides have also been investigated in the oxidation of VOCs, and these studies have reported the influence of the preparation methods on the activity [149, 150, 158] .\n\nAlthough several effective metal oxide catalysts have been developed for the combustion of VOCs, some challenges still remain. For example, ordered meso-porous chromium trioxide is very active for toluene oxidation [159] , but the high toxicity of chromium causes serious catalyst disposal problems. The supported vanadia catalysts show excellent activity and stability for the simultaneous removal of VOCs and NO x in the Cl 2 -HCl environment [160] ; however, the corrosive properties of vanadia catalysts inhibit their widespread application, particularly for wet flue gas streams. Therefore, further research is needed to develop novel environmentally friendly and highly effective metal oxide catalysts to not only improve removal efficiencies but also reduce costs for the treatment of a wide variety of VOCs from industrial sources. In addition, more fundamental research to understand the catalytic mechanisms involved in oxidation reactions is also crucial to the objective of developing appropriate industrial materials for the removal of VOCs.\n\nAn individual on average spends more than 90% of the day inside buildings and vehicles; therefore, indoor air quality has great effects on human health [125, 161] . With the increasing public health concerns about hazardous indoor pollutants, how to eliminate indoor air pollutants such as formaldehyde (HCHO), BTX or microbes etc., has been recently received great attention from the scientific community [162] . Physical adsorption, photocatalysis and thermal catalysis are the most common methods for indoor air purification and therefore have been extensively studied.\n\nPhotocatalysis presents an alternative to physical adsorp-tion methods in indoor air pollution abatement [162] . The common photocatalysts are primarily metal oxides or sulphides, i.e., TiO 2 , ZnO, ZrO 2 , SnO 2 , WO 3 , CeO 2 , Fe 2 O 3 , Al 2 O 3 , ZnS and CdS [163] . Because of its superior photocatalytic activity, chemical stability, low cost and nontoxicity, TiO 2 has been extensively studied as a photocatalyst [164] [165] [166] . Under UV illumination, an electron is excited from the valence band to the conduction band of TiO 2 , generating a positive hole in the valence band. Positive holes can oxidize OHor water on the surface of TiO 2 to produce hydroxyl radicals, and then the hydroxyl radicals can subsequently oxidize gaseous pollutants [163] . The organic and inorganic pollutants in the indoor air such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzene, toluene, acetone, ammonia and NO x can all be photo-oxidized into CO 2 , H 2 O and mineral acids on TiO 2 or other photocatalysts [162, [167] [168] [169] [170] . Bacteria in the indoor air can also be removed by photocatalytic decomposition [171] , which is also important for indoor air purification [172] . Because TiO 2 is only active upon UV excitation, there has been much effort to develop second-generation TiO 2 photocatalysts that can be operated not only under UV but also visible light irradiation [173, 174] . Various techniques have been employed to enable it to operate under visible light irradiation. These techniques include surface modification via organic materials and semiconductor coupling, band gap modification by creating oxygen vacancies, and by doping with nonmetals or co-doping with nonmetals and metals [175] . VOCs and bacteria can be photodegraded under visible light irradiation on Fe-TiO 2 [176] , N-TiO 2 [177] , C-TiO 2 [178, 179] , Cu x O/TiO 2 [180] , TiO 2 hybridized with graphite-like carbon [181] and so on. Air-cleaning devices based on photocatalysts require an additional light source. Besides use in air-cleaning devices, indoor wall paint with second-generation TiO 2 photocatalysts have been used for air cleaning under indoor daylight or artificial light [182] .\n\nHowever, the activity of photocatalytic wall paints is currently still not satisfactory, and the development of new materials with suitable activity seems to be a challenging task. Although VOCs and bacteria can be degraded by photocatalysts, the removal rate is influenced by numerous parameters: light intensity, pollutant concentration, humidity and so on. Additionally, the generation of relatively stable reaction intermediates (such as the formation of benzaldehyde, benzoic acid and benzyl alcohol during the photocatalytic oxidation of toluene) may lower the removal rate and even stop the reaction through blocking active sites [183] .\n\nThermal catalysis has been recently studied for use in indoor air purification; however, its application is presently limited to microbe sterilization and HCHO oxidation because the complete decomposition of other indoor air pollutants by catalytic oxidation requires a much higher reaction temperature than room temperature.\n\nPhotocatalytic disinfection requires use of photon energy and a relatively complex device. Therefore, development of environmentally friendly and economic catalytic disinfection methods is needed. For this purpose, many researchers have drawn attention to the study of antibacterial materials working at room temperature [184, 185] . Among the various bactericidal metals such as Cu, Zn, Ag and metal oxides such as AgO, CuO, ZnO, MgO, CaO, Ag-loaded catalysts are known to have a wide bactericidal spectrum and relatively high safety [185] . Previous studies by He's group explored the efficiency of silver-loaded bactericidal catalysts including Ag/Al 2 O 3 , AgCl/Al 2 O 3 , and Ag-Ce/AlPO 4 in the inactivation of SARS coronavirus, Escherichia coli, and yeast [186] [187] [188] . These microorganisms could be completely inactivated within 30 min on the Ag/Al 2 O 3 surface at room temperature. The addition of Ce efficiently enhanced the dispersion of Ag loaded on the catalyst surface, and inhibited the elution of Ag + .\n\nUp to now, the bactericidal mechanism of non-photocatalysis technology was controversial. The majority of studies suggest that microorganisms in contact with a catalyst could first cause disruption to bacterial membranes and then apoptosis and decomposition. The core mechanism is the reaction with reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the activation of oxygen molecules on the catalyst surface [187] [188] [189] . Interfacial forces and electrostatic interactions are probably also important factors in this respect. In addition, the toxicity of free metal ions originating from the catalyst materials cannot be ignored. For Ag/Al 2 O 3 , AgCl/Al 2 O 3 , and Ag-Ce/AlPO 4 catalysts, the catalytically bactericidal effect should be considered as a synergic action of ROS and Ag + [186] [187] [188] [189] . In short, catalytic sterilization is a potential technology for air disinfection and purification.\n\nThe catalytic oxidation of HCHO has also been investigated over many kinds of materials such as the supported noble metal-based catalysts (Pt, Pd, Rh, Au, Ag) [190] [191] [192] or transition metal oxide catalysts (Mn,Sn) [193] [194] [195] . OMS-2 shows good activity even in the presence or H 2 O; however, noble metal catalysts show much higher activity than metal oxide catalysts. The oxidation of HCHO under ambient conditions has been mainly achieved on Pt-, Pd-and Au-supported catalysts. Among them, Pt-based catalysts were found to be the most effective catalysts for HCHO oxidation at ambient temperature [196] . Zhang et al. first reported in 2005 that a Pt/TiO 2 catalyst could effectively catalyze the HCHO oxidation into H 2 O and CO 2 at room temperature [192] . Since then, catalysts with Pt supported on MnO x -CeO 2 [193] , Fe 2 O 3 [197] , Al 2 O 3 and MgO [198] were also investigated and all Pt-based catalysts exhibited high efficiency for ambient HCHO oxidation, revealing that the support has little effect on the catalytic activities. The high activity of the Pt/TiO 2 catalyst has been mainly attributed to the high dispersion of Pt on the support surface and the promotion of oxygen mobility [199] . More recently, it was reported the addition of alkali-metal could significantly improve the activity of Pt/TiO 2 for the ambient HCHO destruction because Na doping further promoted Pt dispersion and induced an atomically dispersed Pt-O(OH) x -alkali species [192] .\n\nThe formaldehyde oxidation pathway and intermediates over Pt-base catalysts was also proposed based on the results of in situ DRIFTS experiments. Zhang et al. found that surface dioxymethylene (DOM), formate and CO species are the main reaction intermediates during the HCHO oxidation over Pt/TiO 2 catalysts [196, 199] . DOM could be quickly oxidized to formate on the catalyst surface and therefore was hardly observed in spectra. The formate species next decomposed into adsorbed CO species and then was oxidized to CO 2 through reaction with surface oxygen. The decomposition of the formate species into adsorbed CO is the rate determining step [196, 199] . Subsequent studies also claimed a similar reaction mechanism for HCHO oxidation over Pt/TiO 2 catalysts at room temperature [200] . Zhang et al. also studied the reaction mechanism of HCHO oxidation over Na-promoted Pt/TiO 2 catalysts using in situ DRIFTS [192] . They observed that Na addition opened a new lowtemperature reaction pathway by greatly promoting the activation of surface OH groups and then catalyzing a facile reaction between surface OH and formate species to total oxidation products, rather than the decomposition of formate to CO followed by CO oxidation [192] .\n\nRecent treatment methodologies involving catalysis have the potential to treat all types of organic and inorganic contaminants, which include oxidative and reductive processes. The oxidative processes, which are all oxygen based, are usually termed Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs). Due to sufficient hydroxyl radicals in the processes, most of organic contaminants are converted into carbon dioxide, short-chain organic acids, and inorganic ions, typically less toxic and amenable to biodegradation. The reductive processes are carried out by the catalytic reduction of metal for the detoxification of halogenated compound and inorganic pollutants in water. In this present, the catalytic materials and catalytic degradation process of contaminants will be summarized for water.\n\nAlthough the homogeneous Fenton reaction is highly efficient and low cost for wastewater treatment by detoxification [201] , destruction of organic pollutants (dyes, aromatic compounds) [202] , and biodegradability improvement [203] , it suffers from the drawback of a narrow pH range (pH < 3) and Fe sludge disposal and/or regeneration [204] . The main advantage of developing a heterogeneous Fenton catalyst is the fact that it can help to circumvent the problem of iron oxide sludge formation, and as a result it extends the effective pH range [205] . Moreover, its recoverability and reusability [206] further ascertain the benefits of application.\n\nIron oxides/metal doped iron oxides. Iron oxides, such as magnetite, hematite, goethite and ferrihydrite were used directly as heterogeneous Fenton catalysts for the oxidation of azo dye, quinoline, and monoterpene [207, 208] . Different catalytic mechanism of pollutants degradation was also proposed. For example, as shown in Fig. 4 , the reaction may experience an iron cycling on the surface of goethite and OH radical was involved in the pollutants degradation process.\n\nModifications of the iron oxides' structure by doping with other transition-metal cation or by thermal treatment (controlled reduction with H 2 ) have also been studied in attempt to improve the catalytic performance of those materials [210] [211] [212] . It has been proven that the introduction of Mn and Co into Fe 3 O 4 resulted in a remarkable increase in the Fenton activity for the oxidation of organic molecules [211, 213] . The degradation process takes place via radical species, which can be generated by Fe 2+ , Co 2+ and Mn 2+ . The high activity could be attributed to thermodynamically favorable reduction of Co 3+ and Mn 3+ by Fe 2+ by an electron transfer within the semiconductor oxide. The regeneration of Co 2+ and Mn 2+ by this process would be responsible for the remarkable increase on the activity of H 2 O 2 decomposition and organic oxidation. Similarly, Cu-doped \u03b1-FeOOH, Bi 2 O 3 and LaTiO 3 perovskite prepared by Hu et al. [214, 215] are all followed the same catalytic mechanism. These catalysts exhibited high efficiency for the abatement of dye pollutant and endocrine disruptors.\n\nMetal ion incorporated in different supports. Supported transition-metal ions (Cu 2+ , Fe 3+ ) are another type promising Fenton catalysts, and the supports can be organic and inorganic materials, such as zeolite, clay, activated carbon, alginate gel beads, Nafion membrane, cationic exchange resin, collagen fiber etc. Metal ions could be anchored onto the surface of support by ion exchange and participated in the Fenton catalytic cycle. For example, Zhao [204] and Hu [216] reported Fe(III)loaded resin could eliminate dye pollutants and salicylic acid efficiently without leaching out of a significant amount iron ion. Figure 5 revealed that Fe 2+ species was generated from the interaction of Fe 3+ and excited dye molecule via oneelectron transfer, leading to the formation of OH radicals. The resin not only acts as a support for Fe 2+ and an adsorbent toward the pollutants in solution, but also provides a special microenvironment for active iron centers, enhancing the catalytic decomposition of H 2 O 2 even at neutral pH values.\n\nBesides that, Fe III exchanged HY [217] was efficient in the photo-Fenton degradation of phenol at a wide pH range. The enhanced activity was due to the synergistic effect of zeolite by adsorption of pollutant facilitating the rate of degradation. Kiwi et al. [218] have reported the degradation of Orange II by Fe-immobilized Nafion membrane in presence of H 2 O 2 under solar simulated visible light irradiation. The Nafion membrane seemed effective over many cycles photo degradation at wide pH range without leaching out of a significant amount iron ion. Fe 2+ species induced by light in the Nafion was suggested to generate the OH radicals from H 2 O 2 decomposition, leading to the dye degradation.\n\nMetal complex, such as metalporphyrin, metalphthalocyanine, metalbipyridine, salen schiff-base and bioactive hemin could mimic peroxidase and P450 enzymes to catalytically activate oxidants (H 2 O 2 , O 2 and KHSO 5 ) for [204] the degradation of toxic organic pollutants. To immobilize these complexes on different supports such as zeolite, resin and silica gel by molecular impregnation [214] , template synthesis [219] , or flexible ligand route for the Fenton degradation of organic pollutants has been investigated by many research groups.\n\nMeunier reported for the first time that iron tetrasulfophthalocyanine supported on ion-exchange resin could efficiently degrade 2,4,6-trichlorophenol in the presence of H 2 O 2 . However, the reaction rate was greatly reduced when water was used as the sole solvent. Moreover, the requirement of an organic cosolvent compound would hinder the application of this treatment method for organic pollutants. To overcome this disadvantage, Zhao [220] has developed a new catalytic system consisting of iron tetrasulfophenylporphyrin (TPPS 4 ) supported on a commercial anionic ion-exchange resin. In comparison with FeTPPS 4 , the catalyst exhibited much higher efficiency for the photo-Fenton degradation sulforhodamine B and 2,4dichlorophenol under visible light irradiation.\n\nAs show in Fig. 6 Besides, in Hu's group, ferrocene was anchored on silica gel by covalent grafting method at ambient conditions. The catalyst also showed high catalytic activity and stability for the degradation of Acid Red B in the presence of H 2 O 2 under UVA irradiation [221] . Iron sulfophthalocyanine modified HMS molecular sieve and \u03b2-cyclodextrin-hemin [222] were further synthesized and highly efficient for the degradation of malachite green, Rhodamine B and 2,4dichlorophenol at neutral pH in the presence of H 2 O 2 and visible light.\n\nIron hydroxyl/iron oxide-pillared clay. The Fe pillared clay may be one of promising heterogeneous catalyst because of its unique characteristics, abundance and low cost. The hydroxyl-Fe polycation could intercalate clay and be fixed as pillars to form hydroxyl-Fe-pillared clay via cation exchange. Hydroxyl-Fe should be converted to oxide pillars after calcinations at a high temperature through dehydration and dehydroxylation process.\n\nIt has been reported that the hydrolysis products of iron ions, such as Fe(OH) 2+ , Fe(OH) 2 + , Fe 2 (OH) 2 4+ have high photochemistry activity [223, 224] . Hydroxyl-Fe pillared clay may also have high photochemistry activity and could be used as a new photo-Fenton catalyst. Hydroxyl-Fe pillared bentonite was successfully developed by Zhu's group [225] and exhibited a high catalytic activity and good long-term stability in multiple runs in the degradation of Orange II. Its catalytic activity for H 2 O 2 came from hydroxyl-Fe between sheets rather than Fe 3+ or Fe 2+ in tetrahedral or octahedral sheets of bentonite.\n\nThe hydroxyl-Fe-pillared clay would be transformed into \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 -pillared clay when it was treated with calcinations at 350\u00b0C for 24 h. Compared with raw clay, the \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 -pillared clay possesses large micropore volume and specific surface area as well as more special catalytic activity. For example, Hu [226, 227] successfully prepared \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 -pillared bentonite/laponite as a heterogeneous UV-Fenton catalyst to remove non-biodegradable azo-dye Orange II. The results indicated that the catalyst exhibited a high catalytic activity not only in the photo-Fenton decolorizaion of Orange II but also in the mineralization of Orange II.\n\nHeterogeneous catalytic ozonation has received increasing attention in recent years due to its potentially higher effectiveness in the degradation and mineralization of refractory organic pollutants and lower negative effect on water quality. The major advantage of a heterogeneous over a homogeneous catalytic system is the ease of catalytic retrieval from the reaction media. In addition, it has been developed to overcome the limitations of ozonation processes, such as the formation of byproducts and selective reactions of ozone, which are designed to enhance the production of OH.\n\nSeveral metal oxides such as MnO 2 , Al 2 O 3 , TiO 2 , CeO 2 , ZnO and FeOOH were studied as possible catalysts for ozonation process. The activity of these catalysts was greatly influenced by temperature and solution pH. MnO 2 is the most widely studied metal oxide as an ozonation catalyst for the removal of atrzine, oxalic acid, pyruvic acid, N-methyl-p-aminophenol, sulfosalicylic acid and proionic acid. Its activity is known to increase with a decrease of solution pH. Moreover, the structure of MnO 2 , resulting from the method of synthesis, is a significant factor determining its activity. For example, the commercial MnO 2 is not active while the pre-formed hydrous MnO 2 (hydrous Mn IV ) is slightly lower than MnO 2 formed in situ [228, 229] . Al 2 O 3 showed high efficiency for the catalytic ozonation of 2-methylisoborneol, 2,4,6-trichloroanisole, chloroethanol, chlorophenol, oxalic acid, acetic and succinic acid [230] . As shown in Fig. 7 , the higher Fig. 6 Proposed photodegradation mechanisms of organic pollutants in the aqueous H 2 O 2 /FePR system under visible light irradiation [220] density of surface hydroxyls and stronger surface Br\u00f8nsted acidity enhanced catalytic activity of Al 2 O 3 . So that, Al 2 O 3 exhibited higher efficiency of catalytic ozonation when compared to ozonation alone. TiO 2 has been widely used as ozonation catalyst for the degradation of nitrobenzene, 4-chloronitrobenzene, pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine and naproxen) and clofibric acid. Its activity was more dependant on the solution pH and crystal phase structure [201, 231] . For example, the O 3 / TiO 2 system was found to be efficient for oxalic acid degradation in water at acidic pH and TiO 2 is catalytically active if present in the form of rutile and not anatase.\n\nZhang et al. reported that among \u03b1-FeOOH, \u03b2-FeOOH and \u03b3-FeOOH, \u03b1-FeOOH exhibited the highest catalytic activity for ozonation of nitrobenzene [232] . The suggested mechanism included ozone decomposition on hydroxyl groups present on the surface of FeOOH leading to hydroxyl radicals generation. Ozone molecular decomposes with the formation of oxygen and Fe-OH( O) group. Fe-OH( O) subsequently reacts with water leading to the formation of O 2 and OH radical. Both neutral (Me-OH) and positively charged (Me-OH 2 + ) surface groups are responsible for ozone decomposition and OH radicals generation. This catalyst also exhibited good performance for the removal of oxalic acid and p-chlorobenzoic acid.\n\nCo, Mn doped \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 and Fe 3 O 4 were also found to be effective for the ozonation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (herbcides) and phenazone (pharmaceutical) [233, 234] . The multivalent oxidation states greatly enhanced the interfacial electron transfer, causing higher catalytic reactivity. Formation of OH radicals resulting from the catalytic decomposition of ozone was found to be the reason for accelerated removal of organic pollutants from the aqueous solution.\n\nMetal oxides such as MnO 2 , TiO 2 , Fe 2 O 3 , CoO immobilized on supports (silica gel, clay, PAC, Al 2 O 3 , ZrO 2 and TiO 2 ) could also be used as heterogeneous ozonation catalysts for organic compounds removal from water. Their performance was greatly dependent on their method of preparation, thermal history, metal oxides properties and their surface characteristics.\n\nOver 20 ozonation catalysts such as Pt, Pb, Pd, Ag, Co supported on Al 2 O 3 , SiO 2 and PAC were examined by Lin et al. for the removal of formic acid [235] , among which, Pt/Al 2 O 3 and Pd/Al 2 O 3 exhibited the highest activity. Moreover, solution pH and preparation method significantly influence the activity of the catalyst because they decide about the surface properties. MnO x supported on mesoporous ZrO 2 , Al 2 O 3 and CoO x supported on ZrO 2 have been synthesized by Hu's group and showed high efficiency for the catalytic ozonation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (herbcides) and phenazone, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, phenytoin, diclofenac sodium (pharmaceutical) [214, 236, 237] . The results confirmed that the multivalent oxidation states and high dispersion of MnO x and CoO x greatly enhanced the interfacial electron transfer, causing higher catalytic reactivity. The formation of hydroxyl radical resulted in the enhancement of organic pollutants' mineralization.\n\n\u03b2-FeOOH supported on mesoporous Al 2 O 3 showed high efficiency for the mineralization of ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin aqueous solution with ozone [238] . In comparison with \u03b2-FeOOH and MA, surface Lewis acid sites on \u03b2-FeOOH/MA were more greatly enhanced and the Lewis acid sites were reactive center for the catalytic ozonation. The stronger Lewis acid sites of \u03b2-FeOOH/MA caused the more chemisorbed water enhancing the interaction with ozone, resulting in higher catalytic reactivity.\n\nCordierite, perovskite, zeolites and ceramic honeycomb are common used as catalysts in ozonation processes for the catalytic ozonation of nitrobenzene, benzophenone, pyruvic acid, gallic acid, phenolic compounds. It was reported by Zhao et al. ceramic honeycomb was an active catalyst of nitrobenzene ozonation [239, 240] and OH radicals were involved in the reaction process. Moreover, the surface bound hydroxyl groups are responsible for the formation hydroxyl radicals, therefore, the highest efficiency of this catalyst was observed at pH of solution close to pH PZC of the catalyst. Furthermore, modification of the ceramic honeycomb with Mn, Cu and K could significantly increase the hydroxyl radicals' generation. The reaction mechanism was as following: the uncharged surface bound hydroxyl groups caused ozone decomposition into hydroxyl radicals, resulting in the acceleration of nitrobenzene degradation in bulk solution.\n\nIt is well known that activated carbon used together with ozone could provide better removal of color than when the two techniques are used separately. Moreover, activated carbon also showed high efficiency for the removal of phenolic compounds and nitrobenzene in water. Jans and Fig. 7 Suggested reaction mechanism during catalytic ozonation with Al 2 O 3 [230] Hoigne [241] reported that the number of active centers on the surface of activated carbon capable of ozone decomposition is limited, but ozone decomposition and radicals formation are three times faster than in the absence of the catalyst. Hence, ozone decomposition occurs on the surface of activated carbon and hydroxyl radicals formed react with organic molecules in the solution.\n\nBesides, perovskite [242] , zeolite and volcanic sand [243] revealed very high catalytic activity in the process of ozonation of gallic acid. Moreover, the efficiency of ozone decomposition was greatly enhanced in the present of ozonation catalyst, leading to greater free radical generation.\n\nHeterogeneous photocatalysis has been considered as a cost-effective alternative for the destruction of persistent toxic organic compounds [244] . In the process, semiconductor is excited by light energy higher than the band gap, inducing the formation of energy-rich electron-hole pairs, and the charge separation is maintained long enough to react with adsorbed oxygen/H 2 O and to produce a series of active oxygen radicals which finally decompose organic compounds as illustrated in previous work [245, 246] . TiO 2 , ZnO, SrTiO 3 , CeO 2 , WO 3 , Fe 2 O 3 , GaN, Bi 2 S 3 , CdS and ZnS have been verified to act as photocatalysts in redox/charge-transfer processes due to their electronic structures of a filled valence band and an empty conduction band. Among of them, TiO 2 is the most widely used photocatalytic material because it fulfills all of the above requirements as well as exhibiting adequate conversion values [247] . However, the calculated quantum yield is appreciably low (below 10%) for most degradation in TiO 2 photocatalytic system [248] . As has been known for several decades, an improvement in TiO 2 activity requires the simultaneous control of both morphology and defect structure. Modern photocatalysts are usually high surface area materials, consisting of nanometric particle sizes below 100 nm and typically around 10 nm. It seems obvious, that as the surface area/primary particle size increases/decreases, the number of defective anion and cation surface centers increases. The high photocatalytic reaction rates can be obtained by the limitation of primary particle size at the nanometric range, maximizing specific photoactivity rates per surface area unit if the whole morphology (not only the primary particle size) and defect chemistry of the material are adequately handled. Also, the improvement of TiO 2 optical absorption and photocatalytic performance can be achieved by cation and/or anion doping [244, 249] . The photoactivity of anatase-TiO 2 systems was typically enhanced by the addition of noble metals such as Pt, Pd, Ir, and Ag at the oxide surface. These act as electron trapping centers. Also anatase-oxide contact using WO 3 , SnO, ZrO 2 , or other systems aiming at influencing the electron-hole charge separation process was attempted [244, 250] . Solar photocatalysis is expected to be the ideal green technology for water purification. A visible-light-driven photocatalyst has long been anticipated and pursued over recent decades. Recent TiO 2 -based catalysts still are not without drawbacks as efficient visible-light-responsive. Therefore, new and/or more efficient visible-light photocatalysts are being sought with a view to meeting the requirements of future environmental and energy technologies driven by solar energy. A large number of alternative photocatalysts exhibiting a great variety of compositions and structures, have been developed [251] , having good photocatalytic behavior for pollutant degradation. The new photocatalysts predominantly included perovskite (A 2+ B 4+ O 3 ), perovskite-related materials, A 3+ B 5+ O 4 compounds with scheelite structures and even iron spinels (AB 2 O 4 ). In particular, perovskite-like compounds are stable structures which form solid solutions with a range of metal ions. Hence they are considered promising solids for the chemical substitution of TiO 2 with a view to achieving the appropriate band engineering and consequent band gap lowering required [252] . Furthermore, new nonoxidic structures such as nitrides and sulfides have emerged as promising alternatives for TiO 2 photocatalytic oxidation. Perovskite-structured materials are mainly bismuthate compounds MBiO 3 (M = Li, Na, K, Ag), and the ferrite family (LaFeO 3 , SrFeO 3 , BaFeO 3 and BiFeO 3 ) [253] [254] [255] . In general, these catalysts are prepared by hydrothermal synthesis. Different morphologies can be achieved by controlling the parameters of the hydrothermal synthesis. The most interesting result, reported by Ruan et al., refers to the differential photocatalytic behavior observed as a function of the final morphology. So, while microplatelet and nanosheets appear to be photoactive under UV irradiation, nanosheets produce a higher photocatalytic performance under visible irradiation [256] . For Perovskite-Related Structures, Bi 2 WO 6 [257] is the simplest and probably the most studied example within this family. Beside this, Bi 2 MoO 6 [258] , Bi 3 O 4 Cl (Eg = 2.79 eV) [259] , Na 0.5 Bi 1.5 O 2 Cl (Eg = 3.03 eV) [260] and PbBiO 2 Cl (Eg = 2.45 eV) [261] , all exhibit visible-light photoactivity. Also related is the fact that other oxyhalides have been proposed which have acceptable photoactivities in the visible range. Oxybromide and oxyiodides such as BiOBr, PbBiO 2 Br, BiOI x Br 1 -x or BiOI x Cl 1 -x possess good visible light responsive abilities [262] . BiVO 4 is scheelite structure, which has been widely reported as exhibiting good photocatalytic properties. Photocatalysis, a heterogeneous type advanced oxidation processes, has been extensively studied for solar energy conversion and purification of water. The generation of hydroxyl radicals by UV or visible photocatalysis for water treatment occurs at the liquid-solid interface, and the subsequent hydroxyl radical reactions are subject to heterogeneous reaction dynamics. At present, the primary drawbacks of photocatalysis still have been the low quantum yields, which may not be as effective for general water purification processes. However, the growth of heterogeneous photocatalysis will continue to be application-driven, supported by strong process fundamentals. Solar water environmental remediation, which is the mainstay applications, will continue to serve as important platforms for showcasing photocatalytic technologies as well as motivation for establishing relevant fundamental knowledge.\n\nReductive catalysis has emerged as a promising water treatment strategy, which offers a more selective transformation of the contaminants to less or nonharmful and more readily biodegradable substances. It is encouraged to be applied to the eliminating of halogenated hydrocarbons [263] , nitrate, nitrite perchlorate [264] and N-nitrosamines (e.g., NDMA) [265] , which being an important class of wastewater-derived micropollutants in water. Several catalysts have been developed for the reductive catalysis in water purification. For example, palladium (Pd)-based catalysis has been extensively studied at the bench-scale, as supported-Pd and Pd-based bimetallic catalysts can activate dihydrogen (H 2 ) and catalyze reductive transformation of a number of priority drinking water contaminants (Fig. 8) .\n\nParticularly, oxyanions (nitrate, nitrite, bromate, chlorate, perchlorate) [267, 268] , N-nitrosamines (e.g., Nnitrosodimethylamine) [269] , and a number of halogenated alkanes (e.g., carbon tetrachloride, 1,2-dichloroethane), alkenes (e.g., trichloroethene, perchloroethene) [270] , and aromatics (e.g., chlorinated benzenes, polychlorinated biphenyls) [271] . For example, the nitrogen oxyanions are catalytically reduced to dinitrogen (N 2 ) and ammonia (NH 3 ). Beside these, other metals have also been developed for catalytic contaminant reduction, including supported Pt, Ir, Rh, Cu, Zn, Ru (alone or with a promoter metal), and various forms of Ni [272] [273] [274] . In general, Pdbased catalysts are more active, stable, and selective for desired end products, and/or less toxic. Here, Pd-based catalysts were focused on published research in the area of catalytic reduction of priority drinking water contaminant, summarizing the characteristics and activity of catalysts, reaction mechanism.\n\nPd catalysts were doped with other metals to form bimetallic catalysts, having enhanced activity, which has been attributed to the changes in geometric and electronic properties [275] . For example, an alloyed Pd/Au catalyst produced by coprecipitation showed the enhanced activity for the oxidation of CO [276] . A bimetallic core-shell structure, consisting of an Au-core with a Pd-shell increased the activity of Pd nanoparticles for the hydrodechlorination of trichloroethylene by a factor 15 [277] . Moreover, the activity of Au-Pd was increased by a factor 34 [278] by optimization of the particle size (4 nm) and degree of Pd coverage (highest activity with 12.7 wt % Pd) of the Au-nanoparticles. Therefore, in the preparation processes, some metal promoters were added, such as Cu [279] , Sn [280] , In [279] , or Re [281] . Meanwhile, Pd has also been added to ZVI in order to eliminate the need for an external H 2 source (i.e., ZVI corrosion forms H 2 ), and potentially enhance reaction rates [282] . To increase metal dispersion and facilitate handling and phase separation, Pd and other catalytic metals are often loaded onto support materials. Common supports for contaminant reduction are activated carbon [283] , alumina [272, 277] , and silica [272] . Other less common but effective supports for nitrate and nitrite reduction include TiO 2 [284] , ZrO 2 [285] , SnO 2 [285] , organic resins [286] , conducting polymers [287] , and carbon nanotubes [288] . An Au support has been shown to be effective for TCE reduction [289] , and zeolites are an effective support for reduction of chlorinated aromatics [290] .\n\nThese supports had indirect effect on activity and selectivity by affecting the density, size, and morphology of catalytic metal clusters on their surfaces [291] , and the distribution of reactive sites. Similarly, the preparation methods influence particle morphology and composition [292] , and structural changes to the catalyst maybe occur during contaminant reduction [292] . The particle size determined specific surface area to affect catalytic rates and mechanisms [293] . Additionally, supports with high specific surface area or microporosity can have influence on the activity and selectivity of reactions through mass transfer effects [294] .\n\nIn the catalytic reductive processes, metal catalysts are used to convert hydrogen or other H donor to adsorbed atomic hydrogen (H ads), a powerful reducing agent that reacts with oxidized functional groups. The high functional group selectivity of reductive processes allows for targeted treatment of contaminants within complex mixtures, which is an important factor for the preparation of catalysts. [266] Proposed reaction pathways for catalytic reduction of several priority contaminants in water have been reported. The reactions predominantly followed three categories: 1) hydrodehalogenation for halogenated organics, 2) hydrodeoxygenation for oxyanions, and 3) N -N hydrogenolysis for N-nitrosamines. Many halogenated organics and some oxyanions can be reduced on Pd alone [295] , whereas NO -3 and ClO -4 reduction require secondary \"promoter\" metal.\n\nThe important practical challenges are to maximize the activity and selectivity for desired reduction products (N 2 in this case), improve the resistance toward catalyst fouling, and design reactors for full scale applications.\n\nSeveral aspects should be aimed in future research of environmental catalysis for the abatement of major pollutants in air and water. 1) Environment-friendly catalysts have attracted much attention to develop. 2) Significant efforts should be made for the activity and durability of catalysts, and dealing with catalyst fouling for long-term successful treatment. 3) For the selectivity of pollutants transformation to harmfulness should be more concerned by adjusting heterogeneous catalytic processes. 4) Further efforts at materials design or reactor design for pilot-and demonstration-scales. In addition, work is also needed to couple catalytic processes with other treated technologies. "}
