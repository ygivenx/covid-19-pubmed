There is good correlation between MIC values and clinical response. Treatment failure caused by fungal resistance is rare in humans, but Aspergillus spp. are the most frequently reported resistant fungi. Give by slow IV administration with 10-15 mL/kg fluids for 7 d. Absorption from the lungs following aerosol administration is poor and this route is used to treat pulmonary aspergillosis. Improved clinical efficacy when used in combination with flucytosine or azole antifungal agent. Poorly absorbed from the GI tract so must be given IV, IO, or IT. Most important clinical toxicosis is nephrotoxicity, which is dose related and seen clinically as increases in BUN and creatinine in mammals. Dosing every other day, electrolyte loading, and slow infusion of amphotericin B decrease severity and rate of development of renal toxicity. Other adverse effects include phlebitis, fever, nausea, vomiting, and hypokalemia with resulting cardiac arrhythmia. Measures to prevent vomiting include giving antiemetic drugs before infusion. In dogs, doses higher than 5 mg/kg resulted in death caused by cardiac abnormalities; doses of 2-5 mg/kg occasionally caused cardiac problems, but doses lower than 1 mg/kg were without effect on the heart. Treatment protocols should include pretreatment with sodium chloride and it should be infused at a slow rate. It can be mixed with 5% dextrose solution during infusion. Administration of amphotericin B in 0.45% saline with 0.5% dextrose SC in dogs/cats is a way of administering large quantities of amphotericin B without producing the marked azotemia associated with IV Most species Nebulized 1 : 250 dilution 1-3 \u00d7 d Complete-spectrum virucidal, bactericidal, fungicidal, and sporicidal but aldehyde-free compound of six synergistic active ingredients. Has been tested against every significant animal/human pathogen and has outperformed other disinfectants during efficacy testing, over a range of temperatures, in the presence of organic material, at low concentrations, short contact times, without any corrosive effects on infrastructure, metal nozzles, or any tissue irritation on workers and animals. Can be used to disinfect animal environments in their presence, lowering the environmental pathogen challenge significantly, with no side effects. Using either a nebulizer or a \"smogger\" unit, has been used to treat both individuals and groups of falcons with aspergillosis. Nebulized at a concentration of 1 : 250 and can also be added at the same concentration to drinking water, where it may limit the spread of bacterial or viral diseases Extensively distributed throughout the body. Hepatometabolized and eliminated mainly in the bile. Therapeutically active concentrations maintained longer in tissues than in plasma. Used to treat superficial and systemic infections and to treat and prevent aspergillosis in birds. As oral absorbtion is pH dependent, dosage adjustments are necessary if gastric pH is increased. Oral capsules should be given with food but the oral suspension is better absorbed on an empty stomach. Higher tissue concentrations are reported when itraconazole is dissolved in acid and gavaged with orange juice in pigeons. Treatment of serious infections should be prolonged (>3 mo) and relapses occur. Better tolerated than ketoconazole. Fewer side effects are seen than with other antifungal agents. Beads dissolve best in 5% acetic acid (cola-based fizzy drinks or orange juice may also be used) left to stand overnight. Diarrhea and inappetence has been associated with the use of this drug in juvenile kori bustards. Dose of 10 mg/ kg for 1 mo considered prophylactic. Sporanox liquid (10 mg/mL) is often more convenient. "}
