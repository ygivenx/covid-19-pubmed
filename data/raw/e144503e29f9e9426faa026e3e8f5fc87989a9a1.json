{"title": "Tachycardia amongst subjects recovering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)", "body": "SARS is a new infection in humans caused by a novel coronavirus [1] with unknown medium-or long-term complications. Hong Kong reported a total of 1755 cases and 299 deaths. Palpitation in the form of tachycardia at rest and becoming more marked during mild exertion was noted amongst patients recovering from SARS. Possible causes are deconditioning [2] , impaired pulmonary function, impaired cardiac function, cardiac arrhythmia, thyroid dysfunction, anaemia, autonomic dysfunction [3] and anxiety state. This prospective cross-sectional cohort study was conducted to assess the extent of tachycardia and identify possible cause for it.\n\nFifteen consecutive patients with resting heart rate of more than 90 beats per min (BPM) were recruited from the initial 100 patients who underwent lung function testing at about 2 months from onset of illness. All patients had at least 4-fold rise in SARS-coronavirus antibody titre. The resting 12-lead ECGs showed a sinus heart rate ranging from 90 to 109 BPM. Holter monitoring results are listed in Table 1 . Overall heart rate faster than 100 BPM was observed during the daytime (9am-9pm) but not at night. No other arrhythmia was detected. Heart rate variability using the time domain analysis showed that the standard deviation of all normal RR interval (SDNN) was normal (N100 ms in patients b60 years of age and 97 ms in the 62-year-old patient) ( Table 1) . Signal-average ECG was within normal in all subjects. Echocardiography revealed no abnormality apart from the 62-year-old patient who had mild diastolic dysfunction.\n\nOnly one patient had a moderate restrictive pulmonary function defect (Table 1) . Chest radiography findings, haemoglobin level, length of hospital stay, time elapsed after discharge, presence of complications, WHO Quality of Life (QOL) score and Monitored Functional Task Evaluation (MFTE) score [4] are shown in Table 2 .\n\nThe normal CBP, ESR, LFT, LDH, CK, CRP, as well as results of clinical assessment, suggested that ongoing active disease is unlikely. Normal thyroid function tests excluded thyrotoxicosis. Although coronavirus infection had been demonstrated to cause an autoimmune myocar-ditis in rabbits that may progress to dilated cardiomyopathy [5] , normal troponin I, echocardiography and other negative cardiac investigations in our cohort excluded myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. Mild residual CXR changes, minor lung function impairment and normal blood gas makes pulmonary defect unlikely to be a significant cause of sinus tachycardia during normal activity.\n\nThis cohort of patients had more severe disease with a high proportion having various complications. The pro-longed hospitalization of 18-54 days together with confinement at convalescence could lead to physical deconditioning. The QOL domain score was impaired (scoreb75) in 11/15 in physical health, 13/15 in psychological well-being, with a very low score of V50 in six patients. MFTE score was less than 20 (range 17.6-19.7) in 10 patients indicating the presence of mild functional difficulties.\n\nDeconditioning and anxiety state causes tachycardia in the daytime but not at night, and is compatible with the pattern observed in this cohort. In the absence of significant cardiac, pulmonary, thyroid and haematological dysfunction, we believe that sinus tachycardia is attributable to physical deconditioning and contributed by impaired psychological well-being. Appropriate rehabilitation programs should be instituted to enhance recovery of physical and psychological fitness."}
