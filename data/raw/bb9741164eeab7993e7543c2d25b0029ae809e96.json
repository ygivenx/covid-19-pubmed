{"title": "", "body": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 7 chemokines including IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, both IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), C-C motif chemokine 3 (CCL3), CCL5, CCL2, etc.. These are under the control of immune system. Thus, the overproduction of these cytokines and chemokines contributes to the development in disease [14] [15] [16] .\n\nIL-10, produced by T-helper-2 (Th2), is antiviral, with an infection of coronaviruses leading to a marked decrease in this agent [17, 18] . Interestingly, COVID-19 patients sometimes have a significantly elevated level of IL- 10 [2] .\n\nWhether this is a feature of the COVID-19 infection or the result of medical treatment is unknown. The amplification of the inflammatory response would promote cellular apoptosis or necrosis of the affected cells, which would further fuel inflammation, followed by increasing permeability of blood vessels and the aberrant accumulation of inflammatory monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils in the lung alveoli [19] . This vicious circle would intensify the situation as the regulation of immune response is lost and cytokine storm is further activated, resulting in dire consequences. This putative \"cytokine storm\" pathology associated with coronaviruses is also supported by experimental SARS-CoV models, one of which showed that the severity of ALI was accompanied by an elevated expression of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 inflammation-related genes rather than increased viral titers. In another case, the ablation of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor or the depletion of inflammatory monocytes/macrophages caused a marked rise in the survival rate of coronaviruses host without a change in viral load [19, 20] . Both situations suggest a potential amplifying mechanism involved in CoV-induced ALI/ARDS regardless of the viral load. If a similar pathology also exists in COVID-19, the attenuation of the cytokine storm by targeting several key steps in the process could bring about improved outcomes.\n\nMelatonin is not viricidal but it has indirect anti-viral actions [3] due to its anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and immune enhancing features [21] [22] [23] [24] .\n\nThere are situations in which melatonin suppresses the features of viral infections. In mice whose central nervous system is infected by virus (e.g., J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 10 outcomes of which vary according to the severity of the disease. Melatonin may play a role of adjuvant medication in the regulation of immune system, inflammation and oxidation stress, and provide support for patients with ALI/ARDS and related complications. ALI: Acute lung injury; ARDS: Acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nMelatonin exerts anti-inflammatory effects through various pathways. Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) may mediate the anti-inflammatory actions of melatonin by inhibiting high mobility group boxechromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1), and thus down-regulating the polarization of macrophages towards the pro-inflammatory type [26] . In sepsis-induced ALI, the proper regulation of SIRT1 attenuates lung injury and inflammation, in which the application of melatonin might be beneficial [27] . Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) is closely associated with pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative responses while being an inflammatory mediator in ALI. The anti-inflammatory effect of melatonin involves the suppression of NF-\u03baB activation in ARDS [28, 29] . Melatonin reportedly down-regulate NF-\u03baB activation in T cells and lung tissue [30, 31] .\n\nThe stimulation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is crucial in protecting lung from injury. In related studies, melatonin induces the up-regulation of Nrf2 with therapeutic effects in hepatoprotection, cardioprotection, etc [32] . Whether Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 11 Nrf2 is involved in the CoV-induced ALI remains unknown, but the close interaction of SIRT1, NF-\u03baB and Nrf2 suggests their participation in the CoV-induced ALI/ARDS. As such, the data support the potential anti-inflammatory action of melatonin. Inflammation is commonly associated with an elevated production of cytokines and chemokines, while melatonin causes a reduction in the pro-inflammatory cytokines. TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-8, and an elevation in the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [33, 34] .\n\nThere may be, however, some concerns about the potential pro-inflammatory actions of melatonin when used in very high doses or under suppressed immune conditions where it may induce an increase production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 [35] .\n\nConversely, in ALI infection models, melatonin presents with anti-inflammatory and protective action [6].\n\nThe anti-oxidative effect of melatonin cooperates with its anti-inflammatory actions by up-regulating anti-oxidative enzymes (e.g. superoxide dismutase), down-regulating pro-oxidative enzymes (e.g. nitric oxide synthase), and it may also interact directly with free radicals, functioning as free radical scavenger [3, 4] . Viral infections and their replication constantly generates oxidized products. In a SARS-induced ALI model, the production of oxidized low density J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 12 lipoprotein activates innate immune response by the overproduction of IL-6 alveolar macrophages via toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/NF-kB signaling, thereby leading to ALI [36] . TLR4 is a receptor for the innate immune system, and it is also a therapeutic target for melatonin. In brain ischemia, gastritis and periodontitis disease models, melatonin has documented anti-inflammation actions via TLR4 signaling [37] [38] [39] . The anti-oxidative effect of melatonin has also been confirmed in ALI caused by radiation, sepsis and ischemia-reperfusion [4, 40, 41] . In ALI/ARDS patients, especially when the disease is advanced and in patients treated in intense care units (ICUs), severe inflammation, hypoxemia and mechanical ventilation with high oxygen concentrations inevitably increases oxidant generation locally and systematically [42, 43] . Accordingly, we speculate that excessive oxidation also is likely involved in COVID-19. The extensive studies of Gitto et al. [44, 45] , who used melatonin to treat newborn infants with respiratory distress, has documented the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory actions of melatonin in the lung. Thus, it is likely that the application of melatonin would be beneficial in controlling the inflammation and oxidation in coronavirus infected subjects.\n\nWhen virus is inhaled and infects respiratory epithelial cells, dendritic cells phagocytose the virus and present antigens to T cells. Effector T cells function J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13 by killing the infected epithelial cells, and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells produce and release pro-inflammatory cytokines which induce cell apoptosis [46] . Both the pathogen (CoV) and cell apoptosis trigger and amplify the immune response.\n\nThe exacerbation of cytokine production, excessive recruitment of immune cells and the uncontrollable epithelial damage generates a vicious circle for infection related ALI/ARDS [47] . The clinical characteristics of COVID-19\n\nsuggest that a reduced level of neutrophils, lymphocytes and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood [7, 48] . Melatonin exerts regulatory actions on the immune system and directly enhances the immune response by improving proliferation and maturation of natural killing cells, T and B lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes in both bone marrow and other tissues [49] . In macrophages, antigen presentation is also augmented after the application of melatonin,\n\nwhere the up-regulation of complement receptor 3, MHC class I and class II, and CD4 antigens were detected [50] .\n\nresponse during lung infection. The pathogen, including a virus (CoVs has not yet been tested), triggers NLRP3 activation to amplify the inflammation. There is probably a balance of the protective and damaging actions of NLRP3 in the lung. Thus, in a mouse experiment, inhibition of NLRP3 in the early phase of infection increased mortality, whereas suppression of NLRP3 at the peak of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 14 infection allowed for a protective effect [51] . This supports the use of melatonin in ALI/ARDS when inflammation is most severe. Inflammasome NLRP3 is correlated to lung diseases caused by infection, including influenza A virus, syncytial virus, and bacteria [51] [52] [53] . The efficacy of melatonin in regulating NLRP3 has been proven in radiation-induced lung injury, allergic airway inflammation and oxygen-induced ALI and LPS-induced ALI models, in which melatonin reduced the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils into the lung in ALI due to the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome [4, 28, 54, 55] .\n\nAlthough there is obviously no report related to the use of melatonin in COVID-19 patients, in subjects with other diseases and an increased level of inflammation, the application of melatonin showed promising results regarding the attenuation of circulating cytokines levels. In a randomized controlled trial, 8- week oral intake of 6 mg/d melatonin caused a significant decrease in serum levels of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and hs-C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in patients with diabetes mellitus and periodontitis [56] . In another trial of patients suffering with severe multiple sclerosis, orally 25 mg/d of melatonin for 6 months also promoted a significant reduction in serum concentrations of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2\n\nand lipoperoxides [57] . In the acute phase of inflammation, including during surgical stress [58] , brain reperfusion [59] , and coronary artery reperfusion [60] , J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 15 melatonin intake of 10mg/d, 6mg/d and 5mg/d of melatonin for less than 5 days induced a reduced level of pro-inflammatory cytokines. A recent meta-analysis of a total of 22 randomized controlled trials suggested that a supplementary use of melatonin is associated with a significant reduction of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 level [61] . This clinical evidence suggests that the use of melatonin as a supplement may effectively reduce the levels of circulating cytokines, and may potentially also lower pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe integrity of the vascular endothelial barrier is crucial in the immunoregulation within alveoli. Severe inflammation and immune responses induce epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis, as well as increasing the production of VEGF, which aggravates edema and the extravasation of the immune cells from blood vessels. Experimental evidence suggests that melatonin mediates the suppression of VEGF in vascular endothelial cells [62] .\n\nBased on clinical reports of COVID-19, patients with severe ALI/ARDS may also have an increased risk of sepsis and cardiac arrest [2] . Published reports indicate that the application of melatonin may ameliorate the septic shock via the NLRP3 pathway [63] . Specifically, melatonin may a have preventive effect against sepsis-induced renal injury, septic cardiomyopathy and liver injury J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f [64] [65] [66] . It was also reported that melatonin had benefits in patients with myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart diseases and pulmonary hypertension, and probably functions via the TLR4/survivor activating factor enhancement pathway [67] . Moreover, melatonin exerts neurological protection by reducing the cerebral inflammatory response, cerebral edema and brain-blood barrier permeability under a number of experimental conditions [68] . In the ICU, deep sedation is associated with increased long-term mortality, and the application of melatonin reduces sedation use and the frequency of pain, agitation, anxiety [69, 70] . Also, a recent meta-analysis showed that melatonin improves sleep quality in patients in the ICU [71] . Thus, the rationale for the use of melatonin in COVID-19\n\npatients not only focuses on the attenuation of the infection-induced respiratory disorders, but also on an overall improvement and prevention of patients' wellbeing and potential complications.\n\nWhen considering the use of melatonin to treat COVID-19, the safety of the melatonin is of utmost significance to consider. As reviewed previously, short-term use of melatonin is safe, even in those given high doses, and the reported adverse effects are limited to occasional dizziness, headache, nausea and sleepiness; in general melatonin's safety in humans is very high J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 17 [72] . In clinical trials, doses of 3mg, 6mg and 10mg of melatonin oral intake by patients in ICU showed satisfactory safety when compared to placebo [70, 73, 74] . Also, even when melatonin was given to humans at dose of 1 g/d for a month, there was no adverse reports of the treatment [75] . Finally, there were no adverse effects recorded after the use of melatonin in ALI/ARDS animal studies [3, 4, 28] . While the safety of melatonin has been verified in many human studies, its effect when given to COVID-19 patients should be carefully monitored despite the very high safety profile of melatonin.\n\nThe possible beneficial effects of melatonin as adjuvant use in COVID-19 in anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation, immune response regulation has been repeatedly demonstrated in respiratory disorder models induced by infections and associated complications. Melatonin has a high safety profile.\n\nAlthough the direct evidence of melatonin application in COVID-19 is unclear, both its use in experimental animal models and in studies on humans have continuously documented its efficacy and safety and its use by COVID-19 patients predictably would be highly beneficial.
