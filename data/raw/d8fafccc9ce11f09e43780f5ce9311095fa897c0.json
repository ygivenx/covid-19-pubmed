Two unrelated batches of CAV16 samples were purified using (a) 15 to 45% (w/v) and (b) 10 to 40% (w/v) sucrose density gradients at 103614g for 3.5 h and 3 h, respectively. (a) Two states of CAV16 particle were separated from the first sample, one band is located one third from the top of the tube containing ~25% sucrose, the other ~29% sucrose. The absorbance ratio (\u03bb260/\u03bb280) is 0.85 for the top band that corresponds to empty particles containing no RNA , and 1.66 for the bottom band that corresponds to particles containing RNA . (b)\n\nThe second batch of sample yielded three states of CAV16 particles, the top two bands located about one third from the top of the tube contain ~24% and 25% sucrose respectively, the other ~32% The capsid surface is coloured such that VP2 is green and VP3 red (VP1 N-terminii, magenta)."}
