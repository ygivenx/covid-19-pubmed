{"title": "Immunotherapy of SARS based on combinations of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies", "body": "Passive immunotherapy driven by neutralizing human mAbs could be an effective candidate for prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV infection. Neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV S protein could be broadly elicited after virus infection, demonstrating long-lasting immunity in the sera of most recovered SARS patients [13]. Some human mAbs to SARS-CoV have been evaluated in animal models and demonstrated efficacy. Human mAb 80R, for example, may largely reduce viral replication when given as a prophylaxis to mice at doses therapeutically achievable in humans [11]. According to Roberts et al., therapy with neutralizing human mAb 201 to SARS-CoV reduced disease severity and viral burden in Golden Syrian hamsters [5]. This fact suggests that neutralizing mAbs may be used as an important emergent prophylaxis to help rapidly clear the virus, thus providing immediate protection of the human population in the event of a SARS outbreak.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the mechanism of mAbs as antiviral agents may vary, depending on their targeting epitopes or regions. Most of the mAbs targeting epitopes within RBD, as reported by Coughlin et al. and others [8,14], interfere with virus\u2013receptor interactions by blocking attachment of the virus to the target cells, thus providing protection from SARS-CoV replication. Some other mAbs, as tested by Coughlin et al. in this study, target the S1 domain upstream of RBD by inhibiting viral entry through a postbinding event. Since human mAbs inhibit SARS-CoV infection by different mechanisms, combining mAbs with various mechanisms of inhibition and targeting multiple antigenic epitopes may induce additive or synergistic effect, largely reducing the possibility that neutralization escape mutants can be generated. Studies by Rockx et al. have indicated that a cocktail of three mAbs (S109.8, S227.14 and S230.15), which target distinct epitopes, completely protected aged mice against weight loss and virus replication in the lungs following lethal challenge of a live SARS-CoV icHC/SZ/61/03, minimizing the likely generation of escape mutants [10]. The enhancement of protective effect by combinational mAbs recognizing distinct neutralizing epitopes was further confirmed in the current study [8]. Overall, understanding of the mechanisms of action underlying the antiviral activity of these mAbs will be instrumental in the design and development of novel therapeutic treatments against SARS-CoV infection.\n\nIn conclusion, immunotherapies with humanized protective antibodies have been shown to have prophylactic and therapeutic potential for SARS-CoV infections in animal models, thus providing an important basis for clinical trials of these mAbs in human populations. The use of SARS-CoV-specific human mAbs as a prophylaxis may provide a safe, feasible and efficacious way to prevent virus infection, thus serving as an alternative and significant intervention to vaccines. However, caution should be taken when using neutralizing human mAbs as an immunoprophylaxis strategy, in which a genotyping surveillance of SARS-CoV-like genotypes in known animal reservoirs might be required [11]. It should be noted that passive transfer of antibodies may be less efficient in protecting immunosenescent populations than young populations. It is expected that even more effective neutralizing mAbs, targeting multiple epitopes of SARS-CoV containing different mechanisms, could be developed and tested for the prevention of SARS infection and the treatment of SARS patients."}
