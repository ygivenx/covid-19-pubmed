{"title": "Corresponding author(s): Statistical parameters", "body": "A full description of the statistics including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient) AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)\n\nFor null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted \n\nAll studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative.\n\nBiological triplicates (n=3) were performed for primary tissues or cells.\n\nData exclusions No data exclusions.\n\nThree independent experiments were performed with technical duplicates or triplicates.\n\nRandomization Bat materials were randomized by the bat caring group. Human blood materials were randomized by the blood collector. Mouse materials were randomized by the animal facility staff.\n\nStandard measurements (such as absorbance, chemiluminescence, ImageStream acquisition) and same templates (such as ImageStream analysis and FACS gating) were applied to all samples.\n\nReporting for specific materials, systems and methods "}
