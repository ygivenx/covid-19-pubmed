{"title": "Community Under Stress: Trust, Reciprocity, and Community Collective Efficacy During SARS Outbreak", "body": "The study of epidemics is almost non-existent in sociological literature, even though such outbreaks can have detrimental effects on a community. There have been world famous epidemics, such as the bubonic plague, usually known as the Black Death, which killed 1.5 of 4 million people in Europe in the Middle Ages. Similarly, the Great Influenza Pandemic, commonly called the Spanish Flu, occurred at the end of World War I and cost 20\u201340 million lives. Although we know that these epidemics disrupted social life during the outbreak and aftermath, we are not able to study the effects systematically as there are limited data still available.\n\nThe occurrence of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in 2003 provides a rare opportunity to understand the social functioning of a community during the outbreak of an epidemic. With the dangerous potential to erupt into a catastrophic epidemic, the outbreak of SARS shocked the world. SARS victims were found in various countries, including Canada, China, France, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and USA [1]. Between the outbreak of November 2002 to July 2003, 774 died and 8,098 probable cases were reported [49]. In places with higher death rates, the daily activities of residents were disrupted. People avoided meeting in public places, and preferred to stay at home.\n\nTo evaluate the extensive social impact of the outbreak of an epidemic, we focus on the effects of perceived collective efficacy on community action. Since the concept of collective efficacy was introduced recently by Sampson and his colleagues in studying community dynamics [26, 33\u201335], a fast growing body of literature has documented that the collective efficacy of a community is critical to its functioning, and is an important resource within a community [2, 8, 13, 39, 47]. A community with higher collective efficacy brings people in the community together, and reflects the core and classic argument about community, that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Given its significant role in community functioning, in this study we analyze how the collective reaction to the epidemic outbreak is related to collective efficacy, measured by trust and reciprocity.\n\nIn the following sections, we outline the relationships of trust and reciprocity, collective efficacy, and collective action. We then discuss how the outbreak of an epidemic is related to collective efficacy, and in turn affects collective action. We develop a few hypotheses and test them against survey data collected during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Taiwan. The discussion is supplemented by qualitative information to provide a contextual understanding of the situation. In the final section, we discuss the implications of the findings for the social impact of the outbreak, and the ways in which collective efficacy, measured by trust and a sense of reciprocity, is related to the perception of collective community action. In this study, the proxy for community is the city or town where respondents reside. Through the discussion and findings, we demonstrate the importance of disentangling the relationship of perceived collective efficacy, measured by trust and reciprocity, during the epidemic outbreak.\n\nAlthough there has been limited research into social relations when a community experiences an epidemic, there are studies showing how social relations are affected when a community is under stress. In the following discussion, we draw from this literature to explore how perceived collective efficacy, trust and reciprocity are related when a community experiences an epidemic.\n\nSeveral early Chicago sociologists, drawing from the ecological theoretical framework, discussed how stress on a community could disrupt relationships. In his classic essay, \u201cCommunity Organization and Juvenile Delinquency,\u201d Park [27] argued that the \u201chabits\u201d of a community will collapse as the community experiences stress and undergoes change. To further develop this idea, Shaw and McKay [36] argued that when a community is under stress, there is more likely to be a breakdown in the social relations and organizational structures upon which the community relies. Although later studies have focused on how economic deprivation or rapid mobility affects crime rates in a community, the original argument of the social disorganization theory has strong implications for understanding how social relations and social lives in general are affected when a community is under stress. As Park [27] stated, a change or stress in the community \u201cthat brings any measurable alteration in the routine of social life tends to break up habits; and in breaking up the habits upon which the existing social organization rests, destroys that organization itself.\u201d (p.107) Although the argument offers insights to understanding a community under stress, it is unclear how the \u201csocial habits\u201d break up.\n\nHechter\u2019s study [17] of group behavior fills in the theoretical gap and provides an explanation. He suggested that the weakening of informal control would lead to a decline in compliance with group objectives. In the context of our discussion, his argument implies that when a community is under stress, the informal control of social relations, such as trust and reciprocity, will be weakened. In turn, these elements of social relations will be decoupled when there is an outbreak of an epidemic in a community. In addition, later studies on issues related to \u201cfree riders\u201d in groups showed that while institutions play an important role in reducing non-cooperative relationships by imposing heavy penalties on free riders, this control mechanism collapses when institutional arrangements weaken in a situation of vulnerability [28]. Although individuals may maintain trust and reciprocal relationships with selected others, they do not necessarily contribute to the community when they see the increase in free riders, because individuals are less likely to contribute to a group when they do not expect returns.\n\nThe decoupling of collective efficacy from the perception of community action is further reinforced by the nature of epidemics. In Coleman\u2019s terminology, the situation is a second-order public good problem [7]. It is not only about taking advantage by not contributing to the public good, it is also that the benefit to the individuals who contribute to the collective efficacy is not sufficient to overcome the potentially high cost of helping out (i.e., contracting SARS).\n\nThe suggested decoupling of trust and reciprocity from the perception of community action during an epidemic is a fact not observed in studies of natural disaster. For example, Klineberg\u2019s study (2002) of the Chicago heat wave in 1995 showed that the growing mistrust and reduced expectation of reciprocity are positively related to the breakdown of the community action. Similarly, Erickson (1976) found that individuals\u2019 trust in community institutions is related to whether their community experienced disaster. Thus there was an effect on their contribution to the collective good. The differences between a natural disaster and an epidemic in relation to trust and reciprocity lie in the contagious nature of epidemics. Given the possibility of being infected by the disease, individuals hesitate to contribute to the public good even though trust and reciprocity may still be found among individuals.\n\nTherefore, we hypothesize thatCommunity action is positively related to levels of collective efficacy, measured by trust and reciprocity;Community action less likely occurs among communities with an outbreak of epidemic;Levels of collective efficacy, measure by trust and reciprocity, are not associated with community action when the community is under stress.\n\n\nThis study of the social effects of SARS in Taiwan is based on a unique data set, the 2003 Taiwan Social Image Survey (TSIS), collected during the outbreak of SARS. TSIS began in 1990 and four surveys are administered each year to gauge the perception, attitudes, value, and subjective well-being of the people of the societies, Following the general procedure of telephone survey, a representative sample of population in Taiwan were generated from the last two digits of the telephone numbers from a file of telephone numbers1 compiled by the telephone company in Taiwan. The interviews were conducted through a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system housed at the Center for Survey Research, Academia Sinica.\n\nThe survey employed in this study was taken from the May cycle of the TSIS in 2003. The interviews were administered between May 27 and May 30, 2003. The average length of each interview was about half an hour. To put this information in context, the first case of SARS in Taiwan was reported on March 14, 2003; there were 676 cases reported by the end of May [11]; and the last case was reported on June 15, 2003 (WHO 2003). The survey was conducted during the peak of the SARS outbreak.\n\nOur data include respondents from age 18 to age 80. There were demographic questions, and respondents were asked about their knowledge of SARS, their sources of information, the causes of the SARS outbreak, preventive behavior, their level of confidence in the competency of various types of agents and agencies, and the impact of the SARS outbreak on their personal life, on society and on the economy. Despite the richness of the information gathered during the epidemic, our study focuses on how the social and demographic backgrounds of individuals and their views on trust and reciprocal relations are related to the community collective efficacy.\n\nData related to the central concerns of this paper are derived from four questions. We used two questions to measure the perception of collective community action. Community refers to the city where the respondents reside. The first question was the respondent\u2019s perception of whether most people carried out collective preventive preparation according to suggested guidelines. It addressed the collective measures set up to prevent further spread of the epidemic. The government launched extensive a nation-wide campaign, strongly advocated that this collective effort was necessary to combat SARS and to contribute to the benefit of the community during the crisis. Individual action was framed in the public discussion as a collective effort to achieve the public good.\n\nThe second question was the respondent\u2019s perception of whether the community took good care of SARS patients and individuals who were quarantined (\u201cCaring for\u201d in Chinese includes physical, social, and emotional aspects).2 During the period between March and April, over 130,000 individuals were quarantined who had had close contact with SARS patients or with travelers from infected areas. The quarantined individuals came from most of the cities in Taiwan. The question considers whether individuals respect the welfare of all members even at a high cost. While the first question relates to collective prevention that ensures the situation will not get worse, the second question addresses the collective effort of taking care of those already in need. Taken together, the two questions incorporate two important aspects of perceived community action.\n\nWe used two indicators, trust and reciprocity, to represent collective efficacy. To measure trust, we asked the respondents whether people in general could be trusted in dealing with the SARS issue. The answers were coded in a four-point Likert scale. The question is consistent with the question on trust asked in the General Social Survey used by most studies on trust [30]. The second indicator of collector efficacy, reciprocity, was measured by a question that asked whether people in the community help one another. The answers were coded in a three-point Likert scale.\n\nIt is important to highlight that our data set is cross-sectional. Therefore, our analysis cannot address how the SARS outbreak affected the level of collective efficacy. However, the data can demonstrate how the levels of collective efficacy are related to the perception of collective efforts among respondents living in cities where SARS occurred and in cities where SARS did not occur. Our interpretation must be cautious.\n\nTo control for the possible effects of the socio-demographic background of respondents, we included their marital status, educational level, and income level. Marital status was coded as \u201c0\u201d for respondents who were married or cohabiting, \u201c1\u201d for those who were single, \u201c2\u201d for widowed, and \u201c3\u201d for divorced. Education is an ordinal variable. To reflect the educational level in Taiwan, categories include \u201cless than elementary,\u201d \u201cthe completion of elementary school (6 years),\u201d \u201cthe completion of junior high (9 years),\u201d \u201cthe completion of senior high school (12 years).\u201d \u201cthe completion of junior college (14 years),\u201d and \u201cthe completion of university (16 years or more).\u201d Compulsory education in Taiwan is 9 years of schooling, including 6 years at the elementary level and 3 years at the junior high level. Family income is an ordinal variable ranging from \u201cmore than NT150,000,\u201d \u201cNT100,000\u2013NT150,000,\u201d \u201cNT50,000\u2013NT99,999,\u201d \u201cNT20,000\u2013NT49,999,\u201d and \u201cless than NT$20,000.\u201d\n\nThe descriptive information of the variable presented in the first table and the latter part of the analysis is to explore the relationship of collective efficacy and perceived community action when community under stress. Therefore, we ran separate analyses for Taipei and Kaohsiung, two major metropolitan cities in Taiwan and where all SARS cases located, and for respondents who were not from Taipei or Kaoshiung.\n\nTo begin our analysis, we report the collective efficacy level, measured by trust and reciprocity, and the socio-demographic characteristics of the respondents. In Table 1, we divide our sample into those who resided in cities where SARS occurred and those in cities without cases of SARS. Cities where SARS occurred included the two largest cities in Taiwan, Taipei and Kaohsiung. We presented statistics to compare whether there were different patterns for respondents in Taipei and Kaohsiung and for respondents in other cities. A T test was used when means were presented, and a chi square test was used for categorical variables.\n\n\nBy and large, as shown in Table 1, a considerable proportion of residents in all cities reported that most people carried out the collective preventive preparation according to suggested guidelines (62%), but a far less proportion of residents reported that the community took good care of SARS patients and individuals who were quarantined (34%). Nonetheless, different response patterns were noted. About 66% of respondents in cities where SARS occurred suggested that all or most people carried out the collective preventive preparation according to suggested guidelines, and 29% considered that the community took adequate care of SARS patients and individuals who were quarantined. In cities where SARS did not occur, the responses were 61% and 35%, respectively.\n\nA close look at the results shows that, despite the government and local media aggressively promoting the importance of following the prevention guidelines throughout Taiwan, there are still substantial differences between respondents in cities where SARS occurred and respondents in cities where it did not occur in reporting whether or not most people carried out the collective preventive preparation according to suggested guidelines. Respondents in cities where SARS occurred had a more favorable view of the collective preventive preparation. Only 15% of respondents from SARS cities answered, \u201cnot familiar the guidelines\u201d to the question regarding compliance with guidelines compared to 22% in non-SARS cities. Despite intense promotion of guidelines that would help to prevent the spread of SARS, respondents living in cities without SARS did not pay much attention. Those cities clearly showed a lower level of collective action.\n\nIn responses to the question of whether or not the community took good care of SARS patients and quarantined individuals (those who were asked to stay at home or in their room at home during the quarantine period), there is also a statistically significant difference between the opinions of respondents from cities where SARS occurred and those where it did not occur.\n\nIn terms of trust and reciprocity, a larger proportion of respondents living in cities where SARS did not occur maintained a high level of trust during this difficult time, and a larger proportion expressed a higher sense of reciprocity. 47 of respondents in SARS cities and 43 in non-SARS cities considered the communities in which they resided to have a high level of trust, while 71% and 70% to have a sense of reciprocity respectively.\n\nTable 1 also reports the socioeconomic characteristics of respondents, which largely reflect the general socio-demographic characteristics of the Taiwan population. Close to 74% of the respondents were married or cohabiting, and over 20% were single. About 68% of the sample had completed senior high school. About 39% had a monthly income of less than NT$50,000.6 The socio-demographic characteristics of respondents residing in two major cities where SARS cases were reported, Taipei and Kaohsiung, were quite different from those in other cities. The differences reflect the fact that these two cities are the major financial and industrial centers of northern and southern Taiwan, attracting a younger population with higher levels of education and income, which are reflected in a higher living standard. The higher socioeconomic status of the residents in Taipei and Kaohsiung may explain the finding that there was a relatively high level of perceived community action in the two cities. Perhaps residents with greater socioeconomic resources, especially education, are able to maintain some kind of community action despite a stressful situation.\n\nThe foregoing results provide clear and consistent support for the hypothesis that there is a significant and positive relationship between (a) level of trust and perceived community action, and (b) reciprocity and perceived community action. In the following section, we examine this relationship when a community is under stress.\n\n\nFor this set of analyses, we ran the same set of models with only the respondents from Taipei and Kaohsiung, two cities where SARS occurred shown in Table 4. For the first set of analyses, as in the previous analysis, the dependent variable is the individual\u2019s perception of whether or not people carried out the collective preventive preparation according to suggested guidelines. The results show that trust levels are not related significantly to the perception of preventive preparation. A similarly insignificant relationship is found between sense of reciprocity and perception of preventive preparation. These relationships remain insignificant even when socioeconomic factors are controlled. The analysis of trust level and sense of reciprocity with perception of whether the community took good care of SARS patients and individuals who were quarantined shows similar results, except reciprocity level becomes significant when socioeconomic resources are taken into consideration.9\n\n\nIn short, the results show that collective efficacy, measured by trust and reciprocity, is not significantly related to any indicator of collective community action when the community is experiencing the outbreak of an epidemic.\n\nThe final set of analyses shown in Table 5 includes only respondents who are not from Taipei or Kaoshiung. The results in general show that levels of trust and sense of reciprocity are positively related to perception of community action.\n\n\nDespite the drastic impact of the outbreak of an epidemic on the social functioning of a community, few studies have analyzed the impact systematically. One obvious reason is the lack of available data. In this study, we employed a unique data set collected during the SARS outbreak in Taiwan in 2003 to understand how community collective efficacy, measured by two indicators: trust and reciprocity, are related to perceived community action, and we explored these relationships further when the community was under stress.\n\nThere is weak support for Hypothesis 2 in our findings. Despite statistically significant differences in responses, closer look of the data shows that a considerable proportion of residents perceived that the community maintained a high level of community action, both in cities that experienced the outbreak of SARS and in cities that did not. One possible reason is that the widespread news coverage of SARS on the island. As most people obtained information from the same sources, their views of the perceived collective efficiency were similar regardless of whether they were living in cities where SARS occurred or not. This study has hinted at the important role of media in affecting the general public\u2019s perception of community action.\n\nThe findings show differences in the relationship between the levels of trust and sense of reciprocity and the level of perceived community action in cities that experienced the outbreak of SARS and those that did not. In cities where there was no SARS outbreak, trust and sense of reciprocity are positively related to perceived community action taken, as suggested by Hypotheses 1. However, as suggested in Hypothesis 3, the relationships are not significant in cities that experienced the outbreak. A possible explanation of the high level of community action in cities that experienced outbreaks and those that did not is that, while trust and reciprocity do not relate to perceived collective action in cities with SARS, different elements of social relations, such as avoidance or self-protection, rather than trust and reciprocity, contributed to the community action in cities that experienced SARS. Since trust can be seen as \u201crational expectation,\u201d then avoidance or self-protection is another form of social relations based on rationality [14]. As Coleman [7] succinctly argued, social relations are no longer based on trust and reciprocity when individuals feel fear and anxiety. Given their sense of uncertainty, they consider it too risky to cultivate relationships based on trust and reciprocity that would lead to long-term stable relations. Therefore, our findings show that perceived community action taken is possible in an uncertain and stressful environment, but not through trust and reciprocity. It is possible that individuals develop defensive strategies in such circumstances and are still take community action. One possible defensive strategy is to reduce the interaction between the community at large and the family, a smaller social unit, while family members take care of one another. The aggregate effect is community action still possible.\n\nIn short, the study has several directions for our future study of the impact of the outbreak of an epidemic on social functioning. First, modern media can vividly portray events associated with the outbreak, and broadcast widely beyond any geographical limitations. Subsequently, though statistically significant differences in responses, analysis of the data shows that a considerable proportion of residents perceived that the community maintained a high level of community action, both in cities that experienced the outbreak of SARS and in cities that did not. Future studies of the outbreak of epidemics should explore these effects of spatial diffusion on collective efficacy and community action in nearby communities. Second, the study has demonstrated that how community action operates can be strongly related to the outbreak of an epidemic. The impact is far-reaching and fundamental to the core of social relations: trust and reciprocity. However, at the same time, the findings suggest that the maintenance of community action in communities where SARS occurred could be retained by other elements of social relations. In other words, community action is not necessarily related to trust and reciprocity. Further studies should identify the alternative elements that are related to community action and how these elements relate to trust and reciprocity in contributing to community collective efficacy. Finally, though our study can show the relationship of how collective efficacy level is related to community action, future study should determine whether collective efficacy affects community action or vice versa.\n\nAlthough the outbreak of an epidemic can have serious social impacts that go beyond the communities immediately affected, we still know very little about the social consequences or how the social functioning of these communities is maintained. An important task for future research is to further investigate various aspects of the disruptions in social lives and changes in social relations that occur during an epidemic. Through a better understanding of these effects, we will be able to extend our understanding of social relations under stress. In these ways, the findings of this study have the potential to inform and enrich our understanding of community social functioning."}
