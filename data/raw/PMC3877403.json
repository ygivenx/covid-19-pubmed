{"title": "An IDEA for Short Term Outbreak Projection: Nearcasting Using the Basic Reproduction Number", "body": "Outbreaks of novel emerging pathogens such as the SARS coronavirus [1], [2] or familiar pathogens whose characteristics have been changed by genetic shift or recombination events such as novel influenza virus strains [3], [4] are an important and ongoing global health concern [5], [6], [7]. While numerous factors contribute to pathogen emergence, including environmental change, global travel and commerce, and selective pressure via food production [5], [8], [9] public health authorities at regional, national, and international levels are confronted with the practical task of outbreak management and control. The capacity to describe the characteristics of epidemic processes in real time, predict the duration and size of epidemics, and quantify the transmission characteristics of new or mutated pathogens poses a major challenge to public health professionals.\n\nMathematical models provide a useful framework for characterization and quantification of ecological processes, including outbreaks of infectious diseases [10], [11]. However, typical model forms focus largely on the epidemiological characteristics of the disease at the time of emergence, and while such models may be used as a platform for projection of intervention effects, they seldom explicitly account for the behavioral, regulatory, and informational interventions that are either put into place by public health authorities, or occur spontaneously in a worried public, once knowledge of an epidemic is widespread [12]. Such limitations can be overcome post-hoc through model fitting and calibration, but insights from models would be most helpful early in outbreaks and epidemics, when such data is almost uniformly unavailable. Standard mathematical models that attempt to project outbreak duration and final size based on initial characteristics will predictably overestimate final outbreak size, since reproduction numbers decline not only due to depletion of susceptible individuals, but also to spontaneous and planned control activities and behaviours [1], [13], [14].\n\nHere we propose a simple phenomenological model derived from observations that estimates of the basic reproduction number R0 fail to accurately project the contours of outbreaks when control interventions are put into place, and in a manner that cannot be attributed simply to misspecification of depletion of susceptible individuals. We propose that this simple model could find application early in the course of an outbreak for provision of credible and easily interpreted projections on outbreak timing, control, and final size.\n\nThe study was approved by the Research Ethics Board, University of Toronto. The Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (IDEA) model is based on concept of the basic reproduction number, R0, defined by Vynnycky and White as \u201cthe (average) number of successful transmissions per infected person\u201d [11] when an infected person first enters a completely susceptible population [11], [15]. The rate of growth of an epidemic is a function of both R0 and the average serial interval, which is defined as the time between symptoms developing in an index case and symptoms developing in a secondary case [11], [15]. We use a symptom-based interval so that the IDEA model is applicable in situations where microbiological or serological diagnosis is not available. Early in an outbreak or epidemic, incident case counts (I) in each serial interval t may be defined as:(1.0)\n\n\nThe basic reproduction number thus describes initial exponential growth of an outbreak or epidemic. As this process continues, the effective reproduction number R is often defined as R0 x S/N, where S/N is the proportion of the population that remains susceptible to infection (defined as S  =  number of susceptibles divided by N  =  total population size), and the decline in R with time results in ultimate termination of the epidemic. However, many outbreaks rapidly dampen after a short period of time, in a manner that cannot be attributed to a decline in susceptibles [1], [13], [14], [16]. A potential mechanism driving decline in epidemics in the presence of susceptibles is spontaneous or planned reduction in the components of R0 itself (disease duration, contact rate, and infectiousness of cases) either because of public health interventions, or due to concern about disease among members of the public. As a decline in R for this reason is unlikely to be estimable in real time in the context of an outbreak, we propose that control be modeled empirically in a time-varying manner analogous to a financial discounting function. The impact of this discounting or dampening factor on case counts may be expressed empirically as:(2.0)where d is a discount factor. The model may be fitted to available outbreak data when case counts are aggregated to reflect likely generation times, and can be readily calculated using information on latent and infectious periods, which are available for many pathogens of public health importance [17], or estimated empirically for novel pathogens [1], [18].\n\nIn order to more fully understand the model's performance based on varying disease and disease control characteristics, we created a difference equation model with discrete time steps, each representing a single disease generation. The model was specified as follows:(3.0)\n(3.1)\n(3.2)Here S is the number of susceptibles in the population, I is the number of infectives, and R is the number of immune individuals. The total population size N  =  S+I+R. Ret is the time varying effective reproductive number: the number of new infectious cases in a given generation created by each infective individual in the last generation. Ret is a function of the basic reproductive number, R0. Typically, Ret is expressed as R0St/N but such a formulation fails to account for control activities and dynamic changes in population behavior that may reduce transmissibility of infection.\n\nWe defined Ret as: Ret  =  R0 \u03bat St/N where \u03ba is a function of time and represents the proportionate reduction of risk of transmission via control activities. \u03bat is defined as the relative risk of disease transmission (RR) raised to some power, such that \u03bat  =  RRx. Here x is some exponential function of t such that x  =  tn and n is an integer > = 0. We refer to n as the \u201corder\u201d of control. For 0th order control, the impact of control does not change over time, and Re is simply reduced by a constant fraction throughout the epidemic. For first order control, disease risk is reduced in a manner that accelerates with time; second and third order control represent \u201caccelerating acceleration of control\u201d, and so on.\n\nWe used this simple difference equation model to evaluate the fit of the IDEA model to simulated epidemics under different assumptions about infectiousness (R0), varying orders of control, under-reporting of cases, and multiple waves of infection. Models were fit by minimizing root-mean-squared differences (RMSD) between generation-specific case counts by adjustment of the R0 and d parameters of the IDEA model. When evaluating the performance of the IDEA model as applied to an SIR difference model under different assumptions about the order of \u03ba, we normalized RMSD by dividing by total case counts, as higher order control resulted in smaller epidemics (and consequently smaller RMSD).\n\nIn addition to generating empirical estimates of R0 and d parameters via fitting, the model can be manipulated algebraically to generate estimates of tmax, the generation where the number of new cases is <1, such that the outbreak is effectively over. Multiplication of tmax by serial interval duration in calendar time provides an approximate estimate of outbreak duration. By manipulating [2.0] it can be seen that:(4.0)\n\n\nIntegration of [2.0] over t also provides a complex expression which predicts total outbreak size, such that:(4.1)\n(4.1.1)Where(4.1.2)Here erf is the so-called \u201cerror function\u201d.\n\nTo test the ability of the model to describe simple epidemic dynamics in an actual outbreak, we applied the model to an outbreak of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) from the territory of Nunavut, Canada, using an empirically derived serial interval of 5 days [18]. Serial intervals may not be constant throughout outbreaks [19], [20] but are assumed to be nearly constant for the purposes of this model. The model was fitted to empirical case counts by minimizing sum-of-squares differences between model-derived and empirical case counts.\n\nWe obtained the daily number of laboratory-confirmed cases of pandemic H1N1 influenza (in which the cases were reported based on the earliest date of symptom onset, initial care, specimen collection, hospital admission, or ICU admission) for each community under study. A laboratory-confirmed case was reported as an individual with influenza-like illness or severe respiratory illness who tested positive for pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus by real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) or viral culture as is typical for Canadian influenza surveillance. As such, cases likely represent a subset of total true influenza cases [21], [22]. These data were provided by the Nunavut Department of Health and Social Services (HSS) and their use in this study was been approved by the Nunavut Chief Medical Officer of Health (Dr. Geraldine Osborne) and Michael Ruta (Territorial Epidemiologist) in 2009. No identifying data regarding individual cases was shared with the research team or used for subsequent analyses. All data included in the dataset used for model evaluation were aggregate, daily case counts for de-identified Nunavut communities. As a result, these data were not deemed protected health information by the territory of Nunavut and therefore, no patient consent was deemed necessary.\n\nCases were normalized to the first day of the outbreak (day 1). The definition of an outbreak was based on the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care (MOHLTC) guidelines [23]. In this instance, two cases are considered unrelated if they are separated by more than the sum of the incubation period and the period of communicability for the causative agent, which is 6 days for pandemic influenza A (H1N1). Data points which could not be considered part of the same outbreak (more than 6 days apart) and all outbreaks less than three serial intervals (15 days) were excluded from the analysis. It was assumed that short outbreaks (less than 15 days for pandemic influenza A (H1N1)) would essentially be over by the time an effective and intensive public health response was mobilized.\n\nSimulations were performed using the Berkeley Madonna dynamic systems modeling package (University of California, Berkeley; http://www.berkeleymadonna.com), and model fits for Nunavut data were performed using the \u201cSolver\u201d application for Microsoft Excel (Frontline Systems, Incline Village, Nevada; http://www.solver.com).\n\nNormalized sum of squares fits of the IDEA model to simulated data were best with first order control (i.e., \u03ba  =  RRt), and were better for systems with low or moderate R0 (i.e., R0< = 5) than those with higher R0 (\nFigure 1\n). Model projections of final epidemic sizes were extremely accurate for a range of R0 values; however, as R0 increased beyond 5.5, model projected end dates for epidemics were later than those seen in simulated data (Figure A in File S1).\n\nFor systems with low or moderate R0, and assuming first order control, stable parameters were identified for the IDEA model within 3\u20134 generations, and the use of these parameter values accurately projected the full extent of the epidemic curve (\nFigure 2\n) in a manner that made IDEA model projections and simulated data indistinguishable. Empiric best-fit values for the \u201cdiscount parameter\u201d d were approximately 0.054 or 0.055 for all low or moderate R0 models. Best-fit R0 values identified for the IDEA model tended to be slightly higher than true R0 values, and the proportionate degree of over-estimation increased as the true R0 increased.\n\nIn simulated epidemics with high R0 initial convergence occurred rapidly as the epidemic grew, with best-fit values of d approximately 0.054 or 0.055, and accurate estimation of true R0 values, in approximately 4 generations. However as the simulated epidemic peak occurred, best-fit R0 estimates, and d estimates for the IDEA model both increased sharply diverging from initial estimates and, allowing the IDEA model to reproduce epidemic peaks and subsequent declines (\nFigure 3\n and Figures B and C in File S1). For high R0 systems, R0 estimates obtained via fitting after the epidemic had peaked were far higher than true R0 values and than values estimated prior to peaks.\n\nUnder-reporting of cases is expected to occur for a variety of diseases of public health importance; we evaluated IDEA fits to SIR model outputs where increasing fractions of cases were unobserved and consequently unavailable for fitting. In fact, we found parameter estimates and final-size-normalized RMSD model fits to be quite stable as long as case reporting fractions exceeded 5% (Figures D, E, and F in File S1); IDEA model fits became unstable only with low absolute numbers of reported cases. We evaluated the impact of multi-wave epidemics on IDEA model fitting, and found that while the structure of the IDEA model made it difficult to fit to multi-wave epidemics, an important indicator of the emergence of a new wave of infection was an increasing gap between sequential best-fit values of the discount factor d as time series used for fitting were extended to include additional waves (Figure G in File S1). We term this indicator \u0394d, such that(4.2)\n\n\nMany outbreaks are characterized by sequential \u201cwaves\u201d that may either signify the impact of seasonal or behavioural influences on disease transmission [24], signify the movement of epidemics into previously unaffected sub-populations [25], or (as in the case of SARS in Canada) may signify failure of control measures [26].\n\nAs the IDEA model appeared to provide a reasonable means of modeling epidemics, especially for R0< = 5, we evaluated the expected relationship between R0, d, tmax and Itotal mathematically, using formulae 4.0 and 4.1 for a range of possible R0 and d values. The IDEA model generates an estimate of R0 and d at each point in an outbreak, and it is then possible to rapidly project the estimated duration and total cases of the outbreak. These results are presented graphically in \nFigure 4\n.\n\nThe Nunavut, Canada data illustrate the behaviour of the model in a real outbreak situation (\nFigure 5\n). This outbreak took place over 27 serial intervals and included 950 cases. The population of Nunavut in 2011 was 31,906 [27]. Initially, the outbreak is unable to gain momentum, as shown in \nFigure 5a\n by the curve predicted when two serial intervals of data are known (SI = 2). Once four serial intervals are known, however, the outbreak grows exponentially and the model (SI = 4) projects a tmax, or outbreak duration, of 74 serial intervals. By SI = 6 (the model fit with 6 serial intervals), the projected tmax is drastically dampened to 15 generations. In these early stages of the outbreak, the IDEA model is able to rapidly determine whether the outbreak is growing or stabilizing, based on the change in tmax and the change in \u0394d.\n\nIn later stages of the outbreak (shown in \nFigures 5b, c and d\n), the model continues to provide a rapid analysis of the immediate direction of the outbreak. \nFigure 5c\n shows a key inflection point at which the outbreak suddenly began growing again. Such biphasic outbreaks can occur for various reasons, such as the end of school closure periods, the arrival of a newly infected individual into a community or a reduction in a public health intervention such as hand sanitizer provision. The model illustrates the new projection in the outbreak behavior as such events occur.\n\nEstimating the impact of public health interactions and the degree of control over an outbreak is a considerable challenge while an outbreak is ongoing. As a result, the IDEA model was used to compare actual versus projected cases as a means of judging whether the outbreak was under control. \nFigure 6a\n shows the Nunavut outbreak with the actual cases of influenza on the \u00d7 axis and the cases projected by IDEA model on the y axis. Each point on the y axis represents the model fitted to i generations and applied to i+1 generations. On average, projections to the next generation are correct within 20.3% [95% credible interval 11.8, 28.8]. In \nFigure 6a\n we propose that when y>x, the model is projecting excess cases, implying that at this snapshot in the outbreak, the current generation had slowed its growth. Similarly, as the outbreak shifts to the y<x side of the line, the model is projecting a total case count lower than the actual outbreak, implying that the outbreak is uncontrolled and that the current generation has exceeded the model's projection. \nFigure 6b\n shows the trend in percent error as the outbreak progresses and demonstrates that after the seventh serial interval the percent error remains below 22%.\n\nWith the development of the IDEA model, we have demonstrated a simple, versatile model for emerging communicable disease outbreaks that has the capacity to provide short term projections of outbreak growth and contraction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of this particular descriptor to epidemic growth, though other fitting methods of varying complexity are well described [25], [28], [29], [30]. However, Wu and Huberman have previously described an approach similar to that outlined above to describe the growth and decay of interest in news items on the Internet, with exponential growth countered by a \u201cdiscount factor\u201d that damps the \u201creproductive number\u201d for page sharing as a function of time [31]. We found that best-fit projections for the IDEA model for disease dynamic systems with low or intermediate R0 were exceedingly good, with parameters derived within 3\u20134 generations able to project the full extent of simulated epidemics with remarkable accuracy. If validated, the implications of such a finding may be profound (e.g., the ability to project, with a high degree of accuracy, the final size and duration of a seasonal influenza outbreak within 2 weeks of onset).\n\nThe application of the model to simulated epidemics with higher R0 (>5) was more challenging, as best-fit parameters derived from early outbreak generations, while close to true R0 values, resulted in epidemic curves that dramatically overshot true epidemics (a difficulty similar to that often encountered when attempting to fit an SIR model to early outbreak data). Nonetheless, the application of this technique to high R0 epidemics may be useful for a variety of reasons: first, early (pre-epidemic peak) IDEA estimates of R0 closely matched true R0 values in simulations, suggesting that the use of this technique for early R0 estimation when novel diseases emerge may be reasonable regardless of whether R0 is low or high. Furthermore, the \u0394d metric, and the abrupt shift in R0 estimates that occurs with the epidemic peak would provide a helpful signal to epidemiologists that the epidemic is peaking or changing. Finally, as parameter estimates stabilize again for high R0 systems, the IDEA model remains a useful tool for projecting the total size and duration of an outbreak. It is also possible that challenges in fitting the IDEA model to simulated data represent not a limitation of the IDEA model, but are rather an artefact of our use of SIR difference equation models, which tend to peak and collapse suddenly with at high R0.\n\nThe utility of this model was evaluated further with data from a large outbreak of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) and the potential of the IDEA model to begin to understand the impact of public health interventions and structural and human behavioural factors in outbreaks was also explored. Although the IDEA model can provide no hypothesis about which factors caused a sudden acceleration or deceleration of the outbreak, it provides a fast barometer of the situation, based on all known cases.\n\nFurther testing and development in real-time outbreak situations will be needed before the IDEA model can be used in public health interventions for nearcasting (short term outbreak projection) and to assess the impact of public health interventions and to separate the impact of such interventions from spontaneous behavioural changes. The model's main asset is its simplicity and the fact that it does not require consideration of population immune status for parameterization. The model is constructed entirely on a case count time series that is likely to be available to public health professionals charged with outbreak control. IDEA requires no sophisticated knowledge of mathematics or computing, and can be realized using commonly available spreadsheet programs. The model's outputs, which include both cumulative case counts under best-fit conditions, and cumulative outbreak duration, would be valuable to front-line public health professionals seeking to budget material and human resources needed to see an outbreak through to its conclusion. This simplicity may make the model especially useful in resource-limited settings where rapid assessment of both outbreak behaviour, and change in outbreak behaviour is needed.\n\nNevertheless, the simplicity of the IDEA model is also a limitation, as it cannot provide insight into the fundamental workings of outbreaks. The factors driving contraction of growth are non-specific and could include the impact of public health interventions, changes in population behaviour, saturation of sub-populations with infection, and changes in the physical environment that speed or slow epidemic spread (e.g., rainfall or change of season).\n\nIn situations where limited public health resources must be allocated to one region at the expense of another, this model may aid in deciding which region is experiencing an outbreak that is growing more rapidly, and which region has stabilized, while using minimal data. Moreover, the model may aid in the assessment of public health interventions. If a drastic intervention is implemented, such as the closing of schools, the model may be able to rapidly identify (by means of a sudden reduction in the expected length of the outbreak tmax) that the intervention is having a positive impact on slowing the outbreak.\n\nOur application of this simple model to influenza outbreak data in an isolated Canadian population has been encouraging, and it is our hope that other groups will assess the usefulness of this model in the context of other diseases and demographic groups. We also hope to translate knowledge regarding this model to front-line public health professionals who may be able to assess its usefulness in real-time. Given the ceaseless emergence of novel communicable disease threats that challenge current public health professionals, we expect no shortage of opportunities for such applications."}
