{"title": "Internal versus external determinants of Schistosoma japonicum transmission in irrigated agricultural villages", "body": "The villages discussed here are located in Xichang County in southwestern Sichuan Province. They are irrigated agricultural villages typical of the hilly and mountainous classification of schistosomiasis transmission ecologies used in China. The amphibious snail Oncomelania hupensis robersoni is the intermediate host of the parasite and lives mainly in irrigation ditches. Exposure to humans occurs in either agricultural or domestic activities involving contact with ditch water. Conversely, snails are exposed, also mainly in the ditch environment, to miracidia which hatch from schistosome eggs, many of which are distributed into the village environment via the use of human and animal waste for crop fertilization. In earlier studies, we found that the determinants of human infection were principally related to the agricultural characteristics of the village of residence and, secondarily, to one's occupation within the village. Neither age, gender, or kinship appeared to be significant determinants of individual risk within a village nor did the small resident domestic animal populations appear to be important in sustaining endemic levels [8,9]. Many of the foregoing findings were made possible because of the very limited control activity in these villages in at least the 5 years prior to the initial surveys in 2000. Hence, the situation as found in that year was assumed to represent steady-state or near steady-state transmission, which is also assumed in the analyses described here.\n\nFundamental to the analysis presented below is that these villages were originally selected because they were known to present a range of endemic disease transmission from low to high intensity. The initial studies were concerned with identifying the internal determinants of these different levels of disease transmission. Hence, spatially contiguous villages were excluded because their parasite-related connections with their immediate neighbours were not the focus of interest at the time. For present purposes, however, a qualitative picture of the setting of these villages can be gained from the map included in the electronic supplementary material while noting that the farmland surrounding virtually all of these villages is immediately adjacent to that of other villages not shown.\n\nIn an earlier analysis of the determinants of the transmission of S. japonicum, a distinction was drawn between site-specific and site-invariant factors [14]. Here, the objective is to determine if an index of the village-specific internal transmission potential arising from that distinction is a useful index of the level of endemic steady state within a village, the rate of re-infection after praziquantel treatment, and of the balance between internal and external sources of the parasite. To derive that index, consider an isolated village in which only internal transmission of the parasite occurs. This case is defined for system (2.1) by the condition CE(t) = ME(t) = 0. In a stationary environment, the time-variable gating parameters \u03b112(t) and \u03b121(t) are annually periodic. It follows that a non-zero endemic steady-state level of system (2.1) is that in which the state variables are also annually periodic with constant time-weighted average values from year to year. There are two stable steady-state levels of system (2.1), the endemic state and the zero state. For infectious disease transmission systems, the basic reproductive number of the system, R0, refers to a stability criterion that, for a given parameter set, determines which of these two states the system will approach over time. However, system (2.1) is nonlinear and time-variable with development delays, one of which is itself time-variable being based on a degree-day model of parasite development in the snail. Hence, to derive a necessary and a sufficient criterion for stability of the zero state, a genuine R0, is a formidable mathematical challenge and beyond the scope of the present study. Given that the objective is to derive an index of the strength of internal transmission, a relative rather than absolute index is sufficient, although a close linkage to the genuine R0 is desirable. Hence, an approximate index will be derived based on stability criteria for an averaged system in which both the gating parameters and the time-variable external inputs are replaced by their annual time-weighted average values. The averaged system is:2.4\n\nApproximating the steady-state conditions of system (2.1) by equilibrium values of system (2.4) involves products of average values versus average values of time-variable products (see the electronic supplementary material). In distinction to system (2.1), the equilibrium states given by the solutions of the algebraic equations resulting from setting the left-hand side of equations (2.4) to zero can be determined as a function of the constant parameters and stability conditions can be established. Recalling that the operating hypothesis is that the Xichang villages were at or near steady-state in 2000, the accuracy of this approximation, given the parameter values and gating functions for the Xichang region, will be assessed by simulation of equations (2.1) in comparison with the values predicted by equations (2.4) in the context of both the 2000 steady state and the 2002 re-infection studies discussed below. The success, or lack thereof, is intended to point to key data insufficiencies as well as inadequacies in approximating the behaviour of the time-variable system by the averaged model.\n\nFor an isolated village where , the equilibrium level of human worm burden, , is given by the solutions to a nonlinear algebraic equation derived by first setting the left-hand side of equations (2.4) to zero and using the third equation to express  in terms , leading to the simplification that . With this substitution,  is given by the solutions to the equation:2.5\n\nAs noted above, the constant parameters occurring in the foregoing equations are divisible into site-invariant and site-specific subsets as specified in table 1. As suggested by equation (2.5), it is convenient to aggregate these subsets into two functional groups. The site-specific group is defined as:2.6\n\nAs indicated in table 1, Sm and \u03b3 relate to human water contact, Xm to uninfected snail density, \u03b2ngo to parasite-contaminated fertilizer use and Ah and As the area of snail habitat and surface water in the village, respectively. Values for S,Ah, As, Xm and n for the 10 villages studied here are given in table 2 and g0 is available from the literature [8]. \u03b2 is the fraction of human faeces recycled for fertilization internally in the village. Environmental factors also include temperature and irrigation profiles that alter the long-term average values of the gating parameters \u03b112(t) and \u03b121(t). Generally, irrigation profiles will vary between villages, but are here treated as site-invariant because of a regional pumped irrigation system. In general, however, being site-specific, Ps is an index which allows for comparison of the intensity of transmission between villages with the same site-invariant parameter subset, Pb. The latter is defined as:2.7\n\n\nThe site-invariant parameter estimates listed in table 1, including those pertaining to acquired immunity, are based on calibration calculations reported in earlier work [12,14,16]. Here, a value of Pb = 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22122 is used. It should be noted that the estimates of the spatial parameters derived below are conditioned on the value of Pb as well as on the degree to which the average value of the gating functions adequately captures their impact on the time-variable system. Hence, while there is uncertainty in the value of this parameter aggregation and the gating parameters, the assumption of invariance across these villages leads to consistent relative rankings based on Ps.\n\nUsing the parameter aggregations and defining \u039b = Ps Pb, equation (2.4) may be simplified to2.8\n\nBy definition, the nonlinear functions \u03a6, f and H are all less than or equal to unity, which leads to the conclusion that \u039b must be greater than 1 for an endemic equilibrium to exist. That property and its specific functional dependence on the system parameters indicate that \u039b is essentially the basic reproductive number of the averaged system in the absence of the effects of the density-dependent nonlinearities [10]. Note that equation (2.8) can be solved for \u039b given the values \u03a6, f and H, which depend only on the equilibrium state,  and the village-specific aggregation constant of the negative binomial distribution, k. Equations (2.6) and (2.8) produce a second estimate of \u039b based on the remaining system parameters, which results in two estimates based on different parameter groups. Both will be used below.\n\nTurning first to the qualitative aspects of equation (2.8), figure 1 shows the product   plotted versus the equilibrium values of village mean worm burden  for the parameters used here and thought to be typical for S. japonicum. The intersection with the horizontal line 1/\u039b shows the values of  satisfying equation (2.8). Because  as , the origin is always a stable equilibrium point. For values of \u039b less than about 1.3, the infection-free state is the only stable equilibrium point. For values of \u039b > 1.3, there are two intersections for , the endemic equilibrium point controlled by the product  and an intermediate point, sometimes called the breakpoint, which has been shown to be generally unstable [10]. It is of interest from a phenomenological perspective that the endemic equilibrium point can exist for what seem to be quite low values of  if \u039b is only slightly in excess of 1.3. This is of some explanatory interest since it can account for the wide range of endemic levels of worm burden observed epidemiologically over quite small geographical areas [8].\n\n\nThe initial cross-sectional survey data to be used for parameter estimation were obtained in 2000 and covered 20 villages of which the 10 discussed here were followed up in 2002. The year 2000 survey data used here are given in table 2 together with the 2002 re-infection worm burden in humans and results of the 2002 snail survey [13]. The data collection methods and full results are given in Spear et al. [8].\n\nWhile all of the field data are subject to some degree of measurement error, estimates of the infected snail density are based on snail surveys and are particularly problematic because the infection rate in snails, even in highly endemic villages, exceeds 2 per cent only rarely. For example, in only nine of the original 20 villages were any infected snails found in 2000, yet human prevalence in the 11 without infected snails ranged from 3 to 34 per cent. In five of the 10 villages followed up here, between zero and five infected snails were found in samples of between 500 and 1500 total snails. For the villages on the low end of the spectrum, the ratio of the lower to the upper 95% binomial confidence intervals on the infection fraction exceeds an order of magnitude. Hence, in these five villages, the steady-state levels of the infected snail density are poorly estimated and, coupled with the probable levels of within-season variation of infected snail density, the estimates of village mean values are imprecise at best.\n\nEstimates for most of the site-specific parameters are available from the field data (table 2). Further, good estimates of the two time-variable parameters, and hence their average values, exist for the interval 2000\u20132002 [13]. However, no estimates based on field data are available for the parameters \u03b3 and \u03be, which represent exposures that differ from the village mean owing to spatial heterogeneity in the interaction between cercarial density and human water contact (leading to human infection) and between miracidial density and snail contact (leading to snail infection), respectively. In general, neither cercariae nor infected snails are homogeneously distributed across the village irrigation system [8]. Seto et al. [15] make a compelling case that \u03b3 is generally an important descriptor of human exposure. As the only remaining unassigned parameters necessary to estimate the index of internal transmission, Ps, the values of \u03b3 and \u03be are important in that they determine the balance between internal and external sources of the parasite. The exceptions are where the infected snail density is zero, in which case only external cercarial inputs are possible, or if a village is classified as isolated, in which case all transmission is internal by assumption. Hexing 1 and Tuanjie 2 are examples of the former, and Shian 5 and Xinlong 7 of the latter. For the remaining six villages, the balance is uncertain. However, for the two isolated villages, it is possible to solve the equilibrium equations of the averaged system for \u03b3 and \u03be using the field data in 2000 from table 2 together with the observed values of the equilibrium states  and . For Shian 5, the mean worm burden was 90.8 with the aggregation parameter of the negative binomial distribution estimated to be k = 0.45 [17]. For Xinlong 7, the worm burden was 110.4 also with k = 0.45. These values result in estimates of 1.03 and 1.11 for \u03b3 and 1.83 and 1.89 for \u03be, respectively.\n\nFor the remaining six villages with infected snails, but which cannot be assumed to be isolated, the data are simply inadequate to estimate these spatial parameters and, therefore, the internal/external balance in any direct way. However, some insight can be gained by determining plausible ranges for \u03b3 and \u03be. Again, the equilibrium equations of the averaged system were used, with the constraint that both  and  be greater than or equal to zero, to derive upper bounds on both \u03b3 and \u03be for each village. These upper bounds correspond to setting both  and  equal to zero and imply that all transmission is internal. Further, the similarity of the estimates of \u03b3 and \u03be for the two isolated villages suggests that those values may serve as reasonable central estimates for all villages in the region with similar irrigation systems and agriculture. Proceeding on this assumption, normal distributions were assumed to describe the variability of these parameters among such villages with means set to the average of the two isolated villages,  and , and variances of 0.33 and 0.54, respectively, truncated, if necessary, to insure that the upper bounds were not violated. Given the values of \u03b3 and \u03be so generated, estimates of the distribution of \u039b for each of the six non-isolated villages with infected snails were then calculated from the equilibrium equations.\n\nFor any one of the six villages, a random draw from the \u03b3 and \u03be distributions allows the calculation of ,  and \u039b from the equilibrium equations of the averaged model. The final complication is that  and  are uniquely determined by the values of \u03b3 and \u03be, but \u039b is a function of their product. Hence, for any values of \u03b3 and \u03be, there are many possible values of \u039b and conversely. While the equilibrium values are invariant at constant \u039b, simulation experiments using the time-variable system, equations (2.1), showed that the 2 year re-infection rates in human residents of Xinmin 7, for example, varied by 5\u201310% over the range of values of  and  for a given \u039b (see the electronic supplementary material). The 2 year re-infection rates in snails, in contrast, varied over a twofold range. Hence, the lack of specific knowledge of these external inputs leads to greater uncertainty in the re-infection predictions in contrast to the equilibrium values. In the simulation studies discussed below, the 50th percentile \u039b from the Monte Carlo runs was used with the \u03b3 and \u03be values corresponding to  and  at the approximate median of the range of sampled values for that \u039b.\n\nTo determine the adequacy of approximations based on the averaged system, equations (2.4), the time-variable system including the time-variable developmental delay in snails, \u03c4z, were simulated using Matlab v. 7.7, for eight villages first to assess the match of the equilibrium conditions to those observed in 2000. The two villages with no infected snails in 2000 were not simulated. For the re-infection predictions, the 2002 field data showed that uninfected snail density had declined markedly from the density in 2000. Therefore, for the 2 year re-infection simulations, the uninfected snail density was changed to the average of the 2000 and 2002 snail survey data and simulated over the period from 1 January 2001 to 1 January 2003. For both runs, the initial conditions on worm burden were set to 5 per cent of those in 2000 reflecting an assumed 95 per cent effective rate of praziquantel treatment and 100 per cent coverage of those infected. The same \u039b, \u03b3, \u03be,  and  values were used as in the steady-state estimating simulations for each of the eight villages.\n\nTable 3 contains the 2.5, 50 and 97.5 quantile estimates from the sample distribution function of \u039b, using the Quantile routine in R, based on 300 Monte Carlo replications together with mid-range values of  and  for the six villages where both internal and external parasite sources are possible. To place these numbers in context, figure 2 shows the range of  and  values that are consistent with the sampled values of \u03b3 and \u03be at the 50th percentile of \u039b for each village. As a benchmark, in the 2000 data, model-based estimates of the internally generated cercariae in the highly endemic isolated village Xinlong 7 averaged about 70 cercariae m\u22122 surface water and 1000 miricidia m\u22122 during the transmission season. Jianxing 6 is clearly an outlier in that the miracidial input at the midpoint of the curve in the figure is about three times that of any other village. With that exception, the ranges of the external inputs for the other villages seem plausible in the light of the Xinlong 7 benchmark also shown in the figure. Xinmin 7 (XM7), for example, is the village with the highest external cercarial input and substantial miracidial input. It is also the village mentioned earlier which was thought to have substantial parasite input from an immediately upstream endemic village in Zhaojue County.\n\n\n\nAlso shown in table 3 is the upper binomial confidence limit on the probability that \u039b > 1.0. This condition is a conservative index of the probability that the village can support endemic transmission without external inputs. Minhe 1 is the only village of the eight non-isolated villages where this analysis suggests that an endemic level supported mainly by internal transmission is a possibility. Solely internal transmission is a possibility given the topographic and hydrologic setting of Minhe 1. However, on the basis of the present analysis, confidence in this result is low because of the low infected snail density. On the other hand, the observed worm burden of 16.9 appears to be on the lower edge of stable endemic levels suggested to be possible by figure 1 and serves to illustrate the low steady-state worm burdens that can apparently occur in this environment. Overall, this analysis suggests that at least seven of these 10 villages received parasite inputs from external sources and, further, none of these appear likely to have sustained internal transmission without these inputs.\n\nThe re-infection trajectories of worm burden, w(t), infected snail density, z(t) and acquired immunity, I(t), for the two isolated and six non-isolated villages over 15 years post-treatment are shown for the 50 percentile value of \u039b in the electronic supplementary material. Since the intent was to determine if the 2000 conditions were consistent with the equilibrium values of the averaged model, it is the steady-state value determined by simulation that is compared with the equilibrium value of the averaged model. Hence, these trajectories assume an unchanged environment based on the 2000 data. This is the case because no system parameters are altered by praziquantel treatment nor was the uninfected snail density assumed to have been changed in these simulations.\n\nFigure 3 shows model-predicted versus observed levels of worm burden and infected snail density for both the 2000 steady-state levels and the 2002 re-infection simulations. The former are year-long averages at steady state and the latter the values on day 730. Here, the 2000 levels at the upper end of each panel are the simulated steady-state levels that should correspond to the initial conditions in 2000 prior to treatment. As expected, the 2002 re-infection levels lie nearer to the origin in figure 3. The 1 : 1 line on each panel of figure 3 indicates perfect correspondence of the prediction resulting from simulation of the time-variable model versus the observed data. Because the timing of both human and snail infection surveys occurred over roughly a month in the 10 villages, the specific values of the simulated re-infection levels in 2002 are approximate. This uncertainty is substantial for the infected snail density owing to the large within-year variation seen in the simulations and is reflected in the greater deviation from the 1 : 1 line for this variable shown in figure 3b.\n\n\nThe particularly notable features of figure 3a are that the isolated villages lie on the 1 : 1 line for both the 2000 and 2002 data. Indeed, the fit is reasonable for all the 2000 data with the exception of Minhe 1. It appears that the low observed endemic level in that village makes it particularly sensitive to the small external input used in this simulation as suggested by further simulations, which showed a very good fit for no external input, but with similar \u03b3 and \u03be values. The major discrepancies are in the 2002 re-infection data in the three villages with high external inputs, as shown in figure 2. The three villages, those lying well above the 1 : 1 line in figure 3a, indicate that the model produces much higher rates of re-infection than indicated by the field data. This can be seen by comparing the re-infection rates in the village-specific simulations of the isolated Shian 5 versus that of Xinmin 7, shown in the electronic supplementary material. The time to near equilibrium in Shian 5 is about 12 years and in Xinmin 7 about 4 years, the latter having high external inputs. The higher predicted re-infection levels may also be due to the fact that the external inputs are treated as constants in both versions of the model whereas that is unlikely to be the case in the field. Whatever the reason, the clear message is that field data are needed on the external inputs, and \u03b3 and \u03be in order to further explore the adequacy of the modelling approach or the other data on which parameter estimates are based.\n\nIn contrast to the worm burden predictions in figure 3a, figure 3b shows that the snail density in the isolated villages is overestimated in 2000 and underestimated in 2002 by the \u03b3 and \u03be parameters produced by the averaged model. Jianxing 6 is clearly an outlier as suggested by its external input profile in figure 2. However, all other villages show higher predicted than observed snail densities consistent with recent field data, collected using the same snail sampling protocols, which showed no infected snails in 35 of 36 re-emerging villages with human infections [1]. The model results, the original field data, and the more recent field data all indicate that these standard protocols have a limit of detection of infection prevalence in snails above that where continued human transmission occurs.\n\nRecalling that the results shown in figure 3 were obtained without curve fitting or village-by-village optimization, the use of the average model and its site-specific parameter set, Ps, provide a reasonable index of the environmental capacity of a village and its residents to support transmission of schistosomiasis when adjusted for external inputs and with at least approximate estimates of internal spatial parameters. This index is simple and its control implications are easily understood. However, with the current data limitations, it leads to marginally useful short-term re-infection estimates for villages suspected of having substantial external inputs. All of these results were obtained based on the assumption of steady-state transmission in these villages in 2000 as well as the fortuitous inclusion of two isolated villages in the dataset. Given the widespread recent use of praziquantel in China, steady-state data are unlikely to be available in other settings for the foreseeable future. Hence, direct data from the field on CE(t), ME(t) and the two spatial parameters will generally be needed to achieve quantitative assessments of local transmission intensity. Moreover, the foregoing results suggest that, regardless of the value of \u039b, external inputs are likely to contribute to the endemic level in a stationary environment and they are very likely to increase the re-infection rate as well.\n\nFrom a strategic perspective, however, the most notable result of these analyses is that only three of the 10 villages, and a good argument can be made that it is three of the 20 original villages, appear to be able to sustain transmission without external inputs of cercariae or miracidia. This observation provides a compelling argument for the importance of connectivity, that is, a metapopulation perspective, in both endemic and re-emergent circumstances. A metapopulation perspective is supported by theoretical studies of Watt et al. [7]. In retrospect, some of the earliest investigations of our group using historical data collected in this area suggested the importance of connectivity although it was not appreciated at the time [18]. Additional support for the importance of hydrological connectivity, in particular, was provided by Xu et al. [19] who carried out large-scale simulation studies of schistosomiasis transmission in this region. Guararie & Seto [20] have shown theoretically that a network of hydrologically and socially connected villages can support endemic transmission without any of the individual villages on the network doing so if they were not connected. Hence, the results presented here, based on field data, lend support to the contention that connected networks of villages are the crucial unit for the purposes of both risk assessment and sustainable transmission control. While the crucial scale of this connectivity remains unclear, if correct, this interpretation suggests the need for the analogue of the air pollution control district, common in the USA, which is based on the characteristics of the airshed and of the source characteristics and distribution within it. These districts often cut across local political jurisdictions as would be necessary in the present case.\n\nA second strategic point, also related to connectivity, arises from the observation that the lack of direct data from the field on CE(t), ME(t) and the two spatial parameters are the major limitation in assessing the sources driving transmission in a single village. A major step forward in addressing this need would be a sensitive, cheap and robust water monitoring procedure for the measurement of the parasite concentration in surface waters. For example, measuring total parasite concentrations in influent irrigation waters would allow estimation of the sum of CE(t) and ME(t). Similar measurements at various locations within the village would allow estimation of \u03b3 and \u03be although the usefulness of both sets of measurements would be greatly enhanced by the development of advanced methods to distinguish cercariae from miracidia. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods have been published for detection of the parasite [21,22] and preliminary work has been carried out in investigating field sampling methods with detection using qPCR methods [23]. These preliminary results hold the promise of circumventing the longstanding difficulty of cercarial monitoring of water [24].\n\nFurther motivation for the development of environmental sampling procedures for the detection of the free-swimming forms of the parasite is offered by circumstances now occurring in China. The extensive recent use of praziquantel and the molluscicide niclosamide has suppressed transmission levels difficult to detect by continued reliance on acute schistosomiasis case reports and episodic surveys for S. japonicum-infected humans and/or snails. For example, in 28 villages which had previously attained control status and were not known to currently support transmission, thorough surveys showed that human prevalence ranged from 0 to 27.8 per cent. Moreover, only one of 7515 snails collected in these villages was found to be infected despite extensive surveys at the time, these human infections were diagnosed [1]. Precedence for the importance of environmental surveillance has also been reported and shown to be effective for other waterborne pathogens, notably in the case of polio virus also in circumstances, as with schistosomiasis in Sichuan, where human case reports had previously provided the first warning of renewed transmission [25]."}
