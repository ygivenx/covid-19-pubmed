{"title": "CXCR3 Ligands Are Associated with the Continuum of Diffuse Alveolar Damage to Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction", "body": "antibody-mediated rejection (15) (16) (17) , air pollution (18, 19) , gastroesophageal reflux (20, 21) , and several respiratory infections and colonizations (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) (28) . Despite these numerous insults, there are only a limited number of histopathologic patterns of acute allograft injury. Foremost is the prototypical pattern of AR, consisting of perivascular mononuclear infiltrates that may extend to the interstitium and alveolar spaces (29) . Lymphocytic bronchiolitis (LB) is an airway-centered pattern characterized by a peribronchiolar mononuclear cell infiltration (29) . Organizing pneumonia (OP) is characterized by excessive proliferation of granulation tissue within alveolar ducts and alveoli (29) .\n\nDiffuse alveolar damage (DAD) has an initial exudative phase with epithelial and endothelial breakdown, alveolar protein leak, edema formation, macrophage activation, and neutrophil recruitment. The proliferative phase is characterized by type II pneumocyte and fibroblast proliferation, extracellular matrix deposition, and marked interstitial thickening. DAD is considered the most severe form of acute lung allograft injury and can be caused by a number of insults including PGD, infection, sepsis, drugs or toxins, and severe AR. DAD is commonly observed in the allograft, particularly in the immediate postoperative period because of PGD (6, 30) . Although several studies have evaluated DAD caused by PGD, there is a paucity of information on the pathogenesis and clinical consequences of DAD occurring after the perioperative period.\n\nHistopathologically, the four allograft injury patterns have a common theme: they all involve the extravasation and infiltration of leukocytes into the area of injury. CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP10, and CXCL11/ITAC are ELR-CXC chemokines (CXCR3 ligands) that signal through a shared G proteincoupled receptor, CXCR3 (31, 32) . These chemokines, induced by interferon-g, act as potent chemoattractants for mononuclear cells (e.g., activated T cells and natural killer cells). Our group has previously demonstrated the role of CXCR3/ligand biology in the pathogenesis of allograft rejection and dysfunction in animal studies (33, 34) .\n\nThe allograft injury patterns (AR, LB, OP, DAD) are determined by interactions between the host (recipient), allograft (donor), and \"insult.\" Thus, we hypothesized that the pattern and severity of allograft injury would be a stronger determinant of CLAD than the various insults causing them. Specifically, the most severe form of lung injury, DAD, should be associated with the highest risk of CLAD. We further hypothesized that this association is mediated in part by an aberrant type I immune response involving the CXCR3/ligand biologic axis.\n\nWith IRB approval, we performed a retrospective review of all LTRs at University of California at Los Angeles between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2010. Patients received surveillance bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy (TBBX) at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-transplant, and during episodes of clinical deterioration. Approximately 6-14 TBBXs were obtained at each bronchoscopy. Biopsies were interpreted by one of three pulmonary pathologists according to International Multidisciplinary Consensus Statement on Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias (DAD and OP) (35) and International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria (AR and LB) (29, 36) . LB was graded as present or absent until March 1, 2009, and thereafter graded according to the revised 2007 International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria (0, B1R, B2R, or ungradable) (29) . To exclude events from the immediate postoperative period (e.g., PGD), TBBXs collected less than 15 days from transplantation were excluded. Any episodes of DAD occurring after 15 days that were attributed to persistent PGD were also excluded.\n\nImmunosuppression and antimicrobial prophylaxis were administered in accordance with the University of California at Los Angeles lung transplantation protocols as previously described (27) . In general, episodes of AR were treated with three doses of solumedrol, 500-1,000 mg intravenously, followed by prednisone, 0.5 mg/kg daily for 1 week and tapered by 5 mg per week down to the previous dose. Management of DAD was by discretion of the transplant pulmonologist. Treatment regimens included high-dose solumedrol, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, basiliximab, or thymoglobulin. Spirometry was performed every 1-2 weeks during the first 3 months post-transplant and every 4-12 weeks thereafter. CLAD was defined as a sustained drop of at least 20% in the FEV 1 from the average of the two best posttransplant FEV 1 measurements (7, 37) . CLAD was further classified as RAS or BOS based on spirometry and chest computed tomography (CT) per the 2013 definition by Sato and coworkers (38) . RAS was defined as DFVC%/DFEV 1 % greater than 0.5 and chest CT showing ground-glass opacification, interstitial reticulation, or interlobular septal thickening. Recipients with CLAD who did not fulfill the criteria for RAS were considered to have the BOS phenotype. Allograft mortality was defined as death or retransplant.\n\nBiopsy data were collected from surgical pathology reports and coded for the presence or absence of DAD, AR (grade A2 or greater), LB, and OP. A biopsy described as ungradable was considered to be a missing value. A subset of patients were consented for the collection of BAL fluid (BALF) for research purposes at the time of their bronchoscopies. Three 60-ml aliquots of isotonic saline were instilled into the subsegmental bronchus in the lingula, right middle lobe, or area of interest and pooled. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and stored at 280 8 C. Chemokine concentrations were measured using Luminex technologies or standard ELISA: CXCL9 bead assay (Bio-Rad Life Science Research, Hercules, CA), CXCL10 bead assay (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and CXCL11 DuoSet kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lower limit of detection for CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 were 19.2, 14.0, and 1.7 pg/ml, respectively. All BALF samples were unconcentrated. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded tissue for the localization of CXCR3 and its chemokine ligands as previously described (28, 39) . Details are provided in the online supplement.\n\nCox proportional hazards models with time-dependent cumulative counts for DAD, AR, LB, and OP were constructed to take into effect the multiple samples per patient and the frequency (recurrence) of the injury patterns. For each of the injury patterns, the cumulative count increased from zero to one at the first episode of injury, from one to two at the second episode, and so forth. In addition to the four injury patterns, the univariable models included other plausible demographic variables associated with poor clinical outcomes: age greater than 70, male sex, single lung transplant, pretransplant diagnosis, and time of transplant. The time of transplant was divided into tertiles: before 9/1/05, 9/1/05 to 2/13/08, and after 2/13/08 (reference group). The final model was determined using a backward selection method (P , 0.05) using all covariates from the univariable models. Subgroup analyses among bilateral LTRs were performed to evaluate the association between the injury patterns and phenotypes of CLAD (RAS and BOS) using cause-specific proportional hazards models with time-dependent cumulative counts for DAD, AR, LB, and OP.\n\nLog-transformed chemokine concentrations were compared between the \"healthy\" and \"pathologic\" biopsies using a linear mixed-effects model to account for repeated measurements. Time from transplant (,90 d vs. >90 d) was included as a covariate. To explore whether the prolonged alterations of these chemokines are predictive of CLAD, serial CXCR3 ligand concentrations were included as time-dependent variables in Cox models for CLAD. Analyses were performed with SAS v9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Definition of abbreviations: AAT \u00bc a 1 -antitrypsin; ATG \u00bc thymoglobulin; BOS \u00bc bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome; CF \u00bc cystic fibrosis; COPD \u00bc chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; DAD \u00bc diffuse alveolar damage; ILD \u00bc interstitial lung disease; IPF \u00bc idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; HTN \u00bc hypertension; LAM \u00bc lymphangioleiomyomatosis; PLCH \u00bc pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis. \n\nIn total, there were 1,928 bronchoscopies with TBBXs from 441 transplant recipients during the period of study. Three hundred forty-three TBBXs were excluded from the analysis because of collection during the first 15 days post-transplant (n \u00bc 322), persistent PGD (n \u00bc 3), and ungradable samples (n \u00bc 18). There remained 1,585 biopsies from 441 recipients available for analysis ( Figure 1 ). There were 328 (21%) biopsies with a perivascular AR pattern in 199 (45%) recipients. These were graded as follows: 162 (49%) grade A1, 103 (31%) grade A2, 60 (18%) grade A3, and 3 (1%) grade A4. There were 468 (30%) biopsies with LB from 245 (56%) recipients, 134 (8%) biopsies with OP from 92 (21%) recipients, and 62 (4%) biopsies with DAD from 52 (12%) recipients. One hundred seventy-seven TBBXs had concurrent injury patterns. The most common cooccurrence was between AR and LB (n \u00bc 87) and LB and OP (n \u00bc 67). DAD occurred with LB (n \u00bc 35), OP (n \u00bc 19), and AR (n \u00bc 8). Seven hundred and ninetyone (50%) biopsies from 441 (100%) recipients had no evidence of histopathology and were classified as \"healthy biopsies.\"\n\nThe prevalence of the histopathologic injury patterns varied by the time from transplant ( Figure 2 ). In general, the frequency per biopsy of AR, LB, and OP were greatest during the first 15-30 days post-transplant with observed frequencies of 23%, 55%, and 21%, respectively. In contrast, the frequency of DAD (after excluding cases caused by PGD) started near 2% during the first 15-30 days and increased to over 9% after the first year. Table 1 lists the patient characteristics by whether or not they ever had an episode of DAD.\n\nProportional hazards models for CLAD were constructed with time-dependent variables for the four injury patterns and plausible demographic variables associated with poor clinical outcomes (Table 2 ). In the univariable models, an episode of DAD was associated with the highest risk of CLAD (hazard ratio [HR], 3.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-4.9), followed by AR (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2-1.9), OP (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7), and LB (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.5). None of the demographic variables were associated with CLAD. In the multivariable model, DAD remained the strongest predictor of CLAD (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.9-4.7), followed by single lung transplant (HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.01-1.91), AR (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.03-1.69), and LB (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.03-1.37) ( Table 2) . For the injury patterns, the HRs represent the increase in risk for a single episode of the injury.\n\nWe further evaluated the association between the injury patterns and the phenotypes of CLAD (BOS and RAS) in subset analyses among double lung transplants. Of the 47 DAD episodes among double LTRs, 31 (66%) developed CLAD. Twenty-six of these 31 LTRs with DAD and CLAD had CT scans available for review: 21 (81%) met criteria for RAS based on the combined spirometric and CT definition, whereas the remaining 5 (19%) were considered BOS. In the multivariable model, DAD (HR, 6.5; 95% CI, 3.3-12.5) and AR (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.8) were both associated with development of RAS (Table 3) . AR was the only injury pattern associated with the development of BOS (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.1). We were unable to estimate the risk of BOS after DAD because of limited sample size.\n\nGiven the large HRs observed for DAD, Kaplan-Meier curves for freedom from CLAD were constructed and stratified by whether or not the recipient ever had an episode of DAD. The 5-year incidence of CLAD was 86% in recipients with at least one episode of DAD versus 43% in recipients with no episodes of DAD (P \u00bc 0.0001) (Figure 3 ). For the recipients who developed CLAD after DAD, the median time from DAD to CLAD onset was 149 days.\n\nAllograft mortality was defined as death (n \u00bc 189) or retransplant (n (Table 4 ). In the multivariable model, only DAD (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.7-3.0), CLAD (HR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.3-4.6), OP (HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5), and age greater than 70 (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-4.0) remained significant (Table 4) .\n\nKaplan-Meier curves for allograft mortality were constructed, stratified by whether or not the recipient ever had an episode of DAD. The 5-year incidence of allograft mortality was 78% in recipients with at least one episode of DAD versus 41% in recipients with no episodes of DAD (P \u00bc 0.0001) (Figure 4 ). For the recipients with allograft mortality after DAD, the median time from DAD to allograft mortality was 278 days.\n\nWe attempted to determine the specific cause of DAD using microbiology cultures, TBBX cultures and stains for organisms, radiographic studies, and clinical notes by the treating physician. In most cases (n \u00bc 39) there was no discernable cause for the DAD. When the etiology for DAD could be identified, the most common was viral infection: cytomegalovirus (n \u00bc 3), parainfluenza (n \u00bc 4), bocavirus (n \u00bc 1), and one case of mixed human metapneumovirus-coronavirus (n \u00bc 1). Other etiologies for DAD included nonviral pulmonary infections (n \u00bc 6), aspiration (n \u00bc 4), severe AR (n \u00bc 3), and recurrent sarcoid (n \u00bc 1).\n\nDAD, AR, and LB all predicted CLAD development in the multivariable Cox model. We tested the hypothesis that a type I immune response involving CXCR3/ligand biology is involved in the association between DAD, AR, LB, and CLAD development. BALF CXCR3 ligand concentrations were compared between the biopsies without pathologic findings (\"healthy biopsies\") and those with DAD, AR, and LB. In total, we assayed 496 BALF samples from 224 recipients. There were 325 \"healthy\" samples from 194 recipients, 20 DAD samples from 18 recipients, 70 AR samples from 56 recipients, and 197 LB samples from 129 recipients. Median BALF CXCL9 concentrations were 19-fold higher during DAD, fourfold higher during AR, and threefold higher during LB as compared with \"healthy\" biopsies (Table 5) . Similarly, BALF CXCL10 concentrations were increased during DAD, AR, and LB, but the increases were less pronounced. BALF CXCL11 concentrations were mildly elevated during DAD, but not during AR or LB.\n\nGiven the increased BALF concentrations of the CXCR3 ligands during DAD, AR, and LB, we explored whether prolonged elevation of these chemokines would be predictive of CLAD. Cox models for CLAD were constructed with serial BAL measurements of the CXCR3 ligands as time-dependent covariates. All three CXCR3 ligand concentrations were associated with an increased risk of CLAD. Ten-fold increases in CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 were associated with HRs of 1.52 (95% CI, 1.1-1.9), 1.45 (95% CI, 1.1-1.9), and 2.25 (95% CI, 1.1-4.6), respectively ( Table 6 ).\n\nWe used IHC on lung biopsy tissue to determine the cellular sources of these chemokines and their shared receptor, CXCR3, during DAD (n \u00bc 5). Both CXCL9 and CXCL10 were expressed by airway bronchial epithelial cells, subepithelial and interstitial infiltrating mononuclear cells, and alveolar macrophages. In contrast, CXCL11 was predominately expressed by vascular endothelial cells. CXCR3 was expressed by bronchial epithelial cells, infiltrating mononuclear cells, and alveolar macrophages ( Figure 5 ).\n\nIn contrast to prior studies of CLAD that focused on specific insults to the allograft (e.g., PGD, gastroesophageal reflux, infections), this study focused on the common pathways of allograft injury (AR, LB, OP, DAD) that are determined by interactions between the host, allograft, and insult. We evaluated 1,585 TBBXs from 441 LTRs and found that DAD, the most severe form of lung injury, was associated with the highest risk of subsequent CLAD (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.9-4.7) and death (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.7-3.0). We further hypothesized that the association between DAD and CLAD would be mediated in part by an aberrant type I immune response involving CXCR3/ligand biology. Using BALF analysis, we found marked elevations in Definition of abbreviations: Allograft Mortality \u00bc death or retransplant; AR \u00bc acute rejection; CF \u00bc cystic fibrosis; CI \u00bc confidence interval; CLAD \u00bc chronic lung allograft dysfunction; COPD \u00bc chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; DAD \u00bc diffuse alveolar damage; HR \u00bc hazard ratio; IPF \u00bc idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; LB \u00bc lymphocytic bronchiolitis; OP \u00bc organizing pneumonia; PH \u00bc pulmonary hypertension; Tx \u00bc transplantation.\n\nTime of Tx: first tertile \u00bc before 9/1/05; second tertile \u00bc 9/1/05 to 2/13/08.

BALF CXCR3 ligand concentrations during DAD. Furthermore, the chronic elevation of these chemokines as determined by serial BALF measurements predicted the development of CLAD. Taken together, these findings support the potential role of the CXCR3/ligand biologic axis in the continuum of DAD to CLAD. Previous studies have repeatedly implicated AR as the major risk factor for the development of CLAD (6) (7) (8) 40) . Several studies have also reported an association between LB and CLAD (40) (41) (42) . Consistent with these studies, we found that both AR and LB were associated with CLAD in univariable and multivariable models. Of the acute lung allograft injury patterns, DAD was associated with the highest risk of CLAD in both univariable and multivariable analyses. Remarkably, those with an episode of DAD had a 5-year incidence of CLAD of 86% as compared with only 43% for those without, suggesting that DAD is an ominous sign of future graft dysfunction.\n\nA recent study by Sato and coworkers (43) evaluated the development of CLAD, BOS, and RAS after DAD among bilateral LTRs using PFTs with lung volume measurements. They found that \"early DAD\" (,3 mo post-transplant) increased the risk of BOS (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.04-1.47), whereas \"late DAD\" (.3 mo post-transplant) increased the risk of RAS (HR, 36.8; 95% CI, 18.3-14.1). Because we do not routinely obtain lung volume measurements at our center, we used the surrogate spirometric and CT definition of RAS in bilateral LTRs, as advocated by Sato and coworkers (38) . In concordance with the results of Sato and coworkers, we found that non-PGD-associated episodes of DAD (.15 d post-transplant) were strongly associated with RAS (HR, 6.5; 95% CI, 3.3-12.5). AR was associated with both RAS (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.8) and BOS (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.1). These subset analysis were limited by small sample size, but support the strong association between DAD and the development of CLAD, particularly the RAS phenotype.\n\nWe found that DAD was associated with a profound increase in the risk of death, even after controlling for CLAD. Recipients who had a single episode of DAD had a 5-year allograft mortality of 78% compared with only 41% for those without DAD. These results conflict with the study by Sato and coworkers (43) that found no association between \"late-onset\" DAD and overall mortality. Further studies are required to reconcile this discrepancy.\n\nSimilar to previous studies (6, 43, 44) , most cases of DAD did not have a discernible cause. In many cases, recipients were treated with antimicrobials before their bronchoscopy, lowering the yield for an infectious diagnosis. Additionally, the more sensitive polymerase chain reaction-based respiratory virus panel became routine at our institution only in 2009. When an etiology could be determined, infection (viral and nonviral) was still the most common cause of DAD, followed by aspiration and severe AR.\n\nWe hypothesized, based on our group's prior animal data, that the association between DAD and CLAD would be mediated in part by an aberrant type I immune response involving CXCR3/ligand biology. In rodent models of AR and CLAD, we demonstrated that these chemokines recruit mononuclear cells through their shared receptor, CXCR3, leading to allograft fibroplasia (33) . Inhibition of CXCR3 or its ligands resulted in a profound attenuation of allograft rejection and dysfunction (33, 34, 45) . Smaller clinical studies by our group and others have demonstrated increased BALF concentrations of the CXCR3 ligands during both AR (33, 46) and CLAD (33, 47) . The current study evaluated 496 BALF samples from 224 recipients and found elevations of CXCL9 and CXCL10 during AR and LB. As expected, there was even greater elevation of these chemokines during DAD, paralleling the risk for subsequent CLAD development. To further evaluate the involvement of CXCR3/ligand interactions in the pathogenesis of CLAD, we explored whether chronically elevated BALF CXCR3 ligand concentrations increased the risk of CLAD. Using Cox models with serial measurement of the CXCR3 ligands as timedependent covariates, we found that all three ligands were predictive of CLAD development.\n\nTo further characterize these chemokine expression patterns, IHC studies were conducted on biopsies during DAD. Both CXCL9 and CXCL10 were expressed primarily by bronchial epithelial cells, infiltrating mononuclear cells, and alveolar macrophages. In contrast, CXCL11 was predominately expressed by vascular endothelial cells. CXCR3 was expressed by bronchial epithelial cells, infiltrating mononuclear cells, and alveolar macrophages. Collectively, these findings support a coordinated effort by chemokines from various compartments within the lung. CXCL11 acts to recruit CXCR3 expressing mononuclear cells from the blood stream. Once in the lung, the CXCR3 expressing mononuclear cells move to the sites of lung allograft injury along a CXCL9 and/or CXCL10 chemokine gradient. This compartmentalization of chemokines may explain the apparent contradiction of CXCL11: less pronounced increases in the BALF but higher effect estimates for CLAD. Although CXCL11 is less detectable in the alveolar compartment (BALF), its augmentation in the vasculature may have an important effect on mononuclear cell trafficking and CLAD development.\n\nThe major limitation of this study is the potential for confounding inherent to retrospective studies. For example, patients experiencing clinical deterioration may have had more frequent biopsies leading to a higher incidence of histopathologic findings. Furthermore, patients who were found to have allograft injury may have received treatment that was not taken into account. At our institution, patients routinely received augmented immunosuppression for AR but not for DAD. Additionally, we do not have data for LB grading, a factor that may have weakened the association between LB, CLAD, and its subtypes (BOS and RAS). Lastly, our study design accounted only for lung allograft injuries that were captured by transbronchial biopsies. Undoubtedly, there were episodes of allograft injury that were missed because of the infrequency of TBBX sampling.\n\nWe believe that a major strength of this study is the identification of a potential mechanism to explain the association between DAD, AR, LB, and CLAD development: specifically the role of CXCR3/ligand biology in the propagation of a damaging \"inflammatory milieu.\" The allograft injury patterns likely represent a deleterious cycle of cell damage, type I immune response mediated in part by CXCR3/ligands, recruitment of injurious mononuclear cells into the allograft causing further cell damage and eventual fibroproliferation. This study evaluated serial BALF and histopathology in 224 LTRs and to our knowledge is the largest study to evaluate chemokine expression patterns during lung allograft injury.\n\nIn conclusion, our results suggest that the histopathologic finding of DAD is an ominous harbinger for the development of CLAD and death. The findings in this study represent a first step in elucidating a mechanism linking DAD to CLAD. Future studies should investigate the involvement of this chemokine pathway and other cytokine pathways (e.g., Th2, Th17) after allograft injury and the pharmacologic disruption of these interactions as a strategy to decrease CLAD development among LTRs.\n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.
