{"title": "A LAIR-1 insertion generates broadly reactive antibodies against malaria variant antigens", "body": "The Plasmodium falciparum clone 3D7 and nine laboratory-adapted parasite isolates from severe and non-severe malaria patients in Kilifi, Kenya (sampled between 2009 and 2010), were cultured in vitro according to standard procedures20 and cryopreserved at the late trophozoite stage for use in subsequent assays. To select for MGD21-reactive infected erythrocytes (IE), cultured IE were incubated with MGD21 for 20 min at room temperature, washed, and rotated with Protein G-coated magnetic beads (Life Technologies) for 30 min at room temperature. Following magnetic sorting, enriched (MGD21+) and depleted (MGD21-) fractions were returned to in vitro culture.\n\nDonors C and D are 29 and 38 years old, respectively, and are life-long residents of an area with moderate malaria transmission intensity (i.e. with an Entomological Inoculation Rate of 21.7 infective bites per person per year)21. Adults in this area are clinically immune from febrile malaria, having acquired immunity during childhood. The two donors were P. falciparum-negative during sample collection.\n\nFollowing informed consent, plasma samples were taken from 2007 to 2014 from 557 adults living in a malaria-endemic region within Kilifi County on the coast of Kenya. The study was approved by the Kenya Medical Research Institute Ethics Review Committee and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee. IE from three parasite isolates were separately stained with 10 \u03bcg/mL DAPI, 200 \u03bcg/mL ethidium bromide or 6.7\u00d7 SYBR Green I for one hour at room temperature. The stained parasites were washed five times, mixed in equal proportions, and diluted to a 5% haematocrit in incomplete RPMI medium. Ten \u03bcL of the parasite mixture was rotated with 2.5 \u03bcL of adult plasma for 1.5 h at room temperature, and agglutinates formed were examined by fluorescence microscopy. In the primary screen, pools of five adult plasma were tested against six Kenyan isolates (in two separate reactions). Pools that formed mixed-color agglutinates were identified and individual plasma within these pools were tested against nine isolates using the same assay. A single isolate (10668) was not detected in mixed agglutinates formed by any of the plasma and was therefore excluded from the study. Two adults (donors C and D) with plasma that formed mixed agglutinates with eight parasite isolates were selected for monoclonal antibody isolation and, following further informed consent, an additional blood sample was taken from each individual in February 2014.\n\nIgG+ memory B cells were isolated from cryopreserved PBMCs by magnetic cell sorting with mouse anti-CD19-PECy7 antibodies (BD Pharmingen, cat. no 341113) and mouse anti-PE microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, cat. no 130-048-081), followed by flow cytometry sorting for IgG+ IgM- IgD- cells. The B cells were immortalized with Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) in the presence of CpG-DNA (2.5 \u03bcg/mL) and irradiated feeder cells as described previously5. Two weeks post-immortalization, culture supernatants were tested for the ability to stain IE from eight parasite isolates by flow cytometry. Cryopreserved IE were thawed, stained with 10\u00d7 SYBR Green I, and incubated with the B cell supernatants for 1 h at 4\u00baC. Antibody binding was detected using 2.5 \u03bcg/mL of goat Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. no 109-606-170). Reactivity was calculated based on the percentage of late-stage parasites (high SYBR Green) recognized by each antibody.\n\ncDNA was synthesized from selected B cell cultures and both heavy chain and light chain variable regions (VH and VL) were sequenced as previously described22. The usage of VH and VL genes and the number of somatic mutations were determined by analyzing the homology of VH and VL sequences of mAbs to known human V, D and J genes in the IMGT database23.Genomic DNA was isolated from two B cell lines of donor C and one B cell line of donor D with a commercial kit (QIAGEN), and antibody-encoding sequences were amplified and sequenced with primers specific for the V and J regions of the given antibody. Sequences were aligned with ClustalW224. Potential cryptic RSS sites were identified using the RSSsite web server25. To determine the heterozygosity of LAIR-1 on Chr19, the following primers were used to perform PCRs on genomic DNA (LAIR1_INTR_FW1 GGCGGTGGGCACTCAGGTTC; LAIR1_INTR_REV1 CACAGGCAGTCACCGGGTCTAGG; LAIR1_INTR_FW2 GGATGCACCATGTCACCCAGTCCTGG). Genomic DNA isolated from PHA- and IL-2-stimulated T cells from donor C was used as a control for sequence analysis.\n\nUnmutated common ancestor (UCA) sequences of the VL were inferred with Antigen Receptor Probabilistic Parser (ARPP) UA Inference software, as previously described26. UCA sequences of the VH were constructed using IMGT/V-QUEST23 and the genomic insert sequences. Nucleotide sequences of the mutated antibodies and the UCA were aligned using ClustalW224, and phylogenetic trees were generated with the DNA Maximum Likelihood program (Dnaml) of the PHYLIP package, version 3.6927,28.\n\nAntibody heavy and light chains were cloned into human IgG1, Ig\u03ba and Ig\u03bb expression vectors22 and expressed by transient transfection of Expi293F Cells (ThermoFisher Scientific) using polyethylenimine (PEI). Cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. The antibodies were affinity purified by protein A chromatography (GE Healthcare). Variants of the MGD21 antibody were produced by i) exchanging VH, DH, JH elements or the light chain with the corresponding sequences of an irrelevant antibody (FI499, reactive to influenza virus28), ii) deleting selected segments, or iii) reverting somatic mutations to the germline configuration with reference to the IMGT database and the original LAIR-1 genomic sequence (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_018930.2). In addition, LAIR-1-Fc fusion proteins were produced recombinantly by cloning the mutated or unmutated LAIR-1 fragment into a plasmid designed for expression of human IgG1 fusion proteins (pINFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2, Invivogen). Based on an alignment of the most potent LAIR-1-containing antibodies with the unmutated LAIR-1 sequence, five key residues that could contribute to gain of binding to IE and loss of binding to collagen were identified and added alone or in various combinations to the unmutated LAIR-1-Fc fusion protein. The MGD21 constructs and LAIR-1 exon mutants were tested for staining of 3D7 IE that were enriched for MGD21 recognition (3D7-MGD21+). For the LAIR-1 exon mutants, MFI values at 1 \u03bcg/mL antibody concentration were calculated by interpolation of binding curves fitted to a linear regression model (Graphpad Prism 6).\n\nTotal IgGs were quantified using 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Nunc) coated with goat anti-human IgG (SouthernBiotech, cat. no 2040-01) using Certified Reference Material 470 (ERMs-DA470, Sigma-Aldrich) as a standard. To test binding to human collagen type I, ELISA plates were coated with 5 \u03bcg/mL of type I recombinant human collagen (Millipore, cat. no CC050), blocked with 1% BSA and incubated with titrated antibodies, followed by AP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG, Fc\u03b3 fragment specific (Jackson Immuno Research, cat. no 109-056-098). Plates were then washed, substrate (p-NPP, Sigma) was added and plates were read at 405 nm.\n\nErythrocyte ghosts were prepared by hypotonic lysis with 1\u00d7 PBS diluted 15-fold in water, and ghost membranes were dissolved in a reducing lysis buffer containing 2% SDS, 10 mM DTT, 10 mM HEPES pH 8, sonicated and boiled. Solubilized proteins were alkylated with iodoacetamide (final concentration 55 \u03bcM) for 30 min at room temperature and precipitated with 80% acetone overnight at 4\u00baC. The precipitates were resuspended in urea and digested with trypsin. For immunoprecipitation experiments, IE were sonicated and dissolved in 7.2 M urea in RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in HBS pH 7.4). The samples were centrifuged and supernatants were diluted 6.7-fold with RIPA buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated with 10 \u03bcg of MGD21 or BKC3 overnight at 4\u00baC. Next, Protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were added and samples were incubated for 1 h at 4\u00baC. The beads were washed four times and immunoprecipitates were digested directly on the beads with trypsin. After trypsin digestion, peptides were analyzed on a Q-Exactive instrument at the Functional Genomics Center in Z\u00fcrich. Raw files were analyzed using the MaxQuant software29,30 and MS/MS spectra were searched against the human and P. falciparum 3D7 UniProt FASTA databases (UP000005640 and UP000001450). Peptide identifications were matched across several replicates. Subsequent data analysis was performed in the R statistical computing environment. Missing values were imputed with a normal distribution around an LFQ value of 21. Statistical significance was evaluated by Welch tests.\n\nGhosts and immunoprecipitates were dissolved in 2\u00d7 SDS sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel under non-reducing conditions. The proteins on the gel were transferred onto a PVDF membrane, which was blocked with 5% milk in TBS with 0.1% Tween (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with 5 \u03bcg/mL MGD21 overnight at 4\u00baC, washed with TBST, and developed with HRP-conjugated sheep anti-human IgG (GE Healthcare, cat. no NA933) used in combination with a chemiluminescent substrate.\n\nGenes encoding the A-RIFINs PF3D7_1400600, PF3D7_1040300, PF3D7_0100400, PF3D7_0100200, and PF3D7_1100500 were produced by gene synthesis (Genscript) and cloned into the pDisplay vector (Invitrogen), which contains an HA tag, as previously described3. RIFIN chimeras containing the constant region of PF3D7_1400600 (residues 38-146) and the variable region of PF3D7_0100200 (residues 151-288) [PF3D7_1400600c_0100200v], or containing the constant region of PF3D7_0100200 (residues 42-150) and the variable region of PF3D7_1400600 (residues 147-325) [PF3D7_0100200c_1400600v], were generated. The pDisplay constructs were transiently transfected into CHOK1-SV cells (GS-System, Lonza) using PEI. Cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. Briefly, one day before transfection, CHOK1-SV cells were seeded at 0.5\u00d7106 cells/mL in 30 mL CD-CHO medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine in 125 mL Erlenmeyer flasks (Corning). On the day of transfection, 20 \u03bcg DNA was diluted in OPTI-PRO SFM Medium (Invitrogen) and mixed with 200 \u03bcg PEI for 20 min at room temperature. The DNA-PEI complexes were added to the cells, which were cultured in a CO2 shaker incubator at 37\u00b0C, 135 rpm. After 72 hours, the expression of RIFINs and their recognition by the LAIR-1-containing antibodies were tested by flow cytometry. Briefly, 5 \u03bcg/mL of rabbit anti-HA tag and 2 \u03bcg/mL of MGC or MGD antibodies were added to the RIFIN-transfected cells. Antibody binding was detected by 5 \u03bcg/mL of Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, cat. no A11034) and 2.5 \u03bcg/mL of Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. no 109-606-170). Dead cells were excluded by staining with 7-AAD (BD Biosciences).\n\n3D7-MGD21+ (5% parasitemia, ring stage) was cultured with various concentrations of MGD21 or BKC3 for 2 d. After 2 d, 10\u00d7 SYBR Green I was added to aliquots of each culture and parasitemia was quantified by flow cytometry. The remaining parasites in each culture were washed to remove the antibodies and incubated for 1 d to allow the parasites to reach the late trophozoite/schizont stage. MGD21 recognition of these cultures was detected using 2.5 \u03bcg/mL of Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat. no 109-606-170).\n\n9605-MGD21+ IE at the late trophozoite/schizont stage were purified from uninfected erythrocytes and ring-stage parasites using a magnetic column (Miltenyi Biotec) and were resuspended in culture medium with 10% human serum. The purified IE were incubated with 10 \u03bcg/mL of MGD21 or BKC3 for 1 h at 4\u00baC, mixed with O+ erythrocytes or A+ erythrocytes in a 1:20 ratio, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature to allow rosetting to occur. The IE were stained with 10\u00d7 SYBR Green I, and the number of rosettes formed by at least 200 IE was counted by fluorescence microscopy to calculate the rosetting rate.\n\n3D7-MGD21+ and 11019-MGD21+ IE (4-5% parasitemia) were diluted to a 3% haematocrit in a 5 \u00d7 SYBR Green I solution containing 5 \u03bcg/mL of the test monoclonal antibody. Each sample was rotated for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently examined by fluorescence microscopy.\n\nIE were stained with 10 \u03bcg/mL DAPI for 30 min at room temperature, washed four times and run on a magnetic column (Miltenyi Biotec) to purify late stage parasites. The purified parasites were opsonized with serially diluted antibodies for 1 h at 4\u00baC. Monocytes were isolated from fresh PBMCs of healthy donors using mouse anti-CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi, cat. no 130-050-201) and mixed with the opsonized parasites in a 1:2 ratio for 1 h at 37\u00baC. Extracellularly bound, non-internalized IE were lysed by treatment with red blood cell lysis solution (Miltenyi Biotec) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were stained with mouse anti-CD14-PECy5 (Beckman Coulter, cat. no A07765) and analyzed by flow cytometry. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of DAPI in CD14+ cells was used as a measure of phagocytosis of IE by monocytes.\n\nThe Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for statistical comparisons of pairs of data groups in rosetting experiments."}
