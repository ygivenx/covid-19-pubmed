{"title": "Role of immune aging in susceptibility to West Nile virus 1. West Nile virus infection in North America HHS Public Access", "body": "The world's population is aging and the global human population over age 60 is predicted to increase to over 2 billion by 2050. 6 With aging, elderly individuals are increasingly susceptible to infectious diseases and have reduced efficiency of responses to vaccination. While individuals over age of 65 currently constitute approximately 15% of the population in the US, the aged population accounts for a disproportionate use of medical resources. Age related changes in both innate and adaptive immune responses, termed immunosenescence, lead to inappropriate elevations, decreases, and dysregulated immune responses. 7 Here, we will review age-related immune dysregulation relevant to host susceptibility to WNV infection. We will also highlight novel areas for investigation and emerging technical approaches (e.g., mass cytometry and miRNA profiling) that promise to advance our understanding of the complexity of aging and foster discovery of novel therapeutic approaches.\n\nNumerous studies in elderly humans have revealed that aging has a profound impact on the phenotype and functions of innate immune cells 7, 8 and these cell types-neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells-have central roles in initiating immune responses to control WNV replication. [9] [10] [11] Dysregulation of two other innate immune cell Neutrophils play a dual functional role in response to WNV infection. Neutrophils serve as reservoirs for WNV replication and dissemination in the early stages of infection, but contribute to WNV clearance later in the infection process. 9 The shift in neutrophils from early pro-viral state to later anti-viral state may result from the effects of cellular context such as the robust production of type I interferon by macrophages in the context of WNV infection. In vitro pretreatment of neutrophils with type I interferon significantly reduced their WNV viral load. 9 In spite of the supporting evidence in the role of neutrophils in WNV infection, the effects of aging on neutrophil functions in response to WNV remain unknown. Age-associated alterations in chemotaxis, phagocytosis, signal transduction and expression of TLR receptors likely contribute to the reduced clearance of WNV infection in older subjects.\n\nMacrophages are professional phagocytes and antigen-presenting cells and many of their functions become compromised in aged individuals, including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, intracellular killing, production of reactive oxygen species and cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12), as well as expression of MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules (Table 1) . 7, 8 In addition, production of prostaglandin E2 is increased in activated macrophages from aged human and mice, which suppresses MHC class II expression and IL-12 production, leading to impaired antigen presentation associated with age. 8 Alterations in TLR expression have been found in aged macrophages. The baseline level of TLR3 is lower in macrophages from elderly individuals. 23 A few studies have also shown an age-dependent reduction in the levels of p38 MAPK, NF-\u03baB, and MyD88, as well as in the phosphorylation capacity of STAT-1\u03b1. 24 The changes of these key signaling molecules are critical factors in the decrease in macrophage activation and cytokine responses in aging.\n\nFollowing mosquito inoculation of WNV in skin, macrophages are early responders from the innate immune system to control initial WNV replication 5 . They efficiently ingest WNV through receptor-mediated endocytosis, and become activated to produce a large amount of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2, as well as type I interferons. These cytokines are critical for restriction of WNV replication and spread and for recruitment of more innate immune cells into the site of infection [25] [26] [27] . However, excessive inflammation and cytokine production upon WNV infection can increase permeability of blood-brain barrier, leading to viral infection of the central nervous system, and severe neurological disease. 26 Our recent studies indicate some interesting clues in this regard. In contrast to WNV-induced downregulation of TLR3 expression in macrophages from young donors, in elderly donors the expression of TLR3 remains elevated in WNV-infected macrophages and leads to elevated production of proinflammatory cytokines. 23 This TLR3 dysregulation results from impaired signaling between DC-SIGN and STAT1, which also leads to an early and sustained elevation of IL-6 and IFN-\u03b21 in the elderly 23 . This alteration of the macrophage response with aging detected in vitro may be relevant to cytokinemediated elevated permeability of blood-brain barrier and increased severity of WNV infection in older individuals. 26 \n\nDendritic cells (DCs) are potent antigen presenting cells which act as a bridge between the innate and the adaptive immune systems. 28 Studies have shown dysregulation of several functions in both myeloid DCs (mDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) with aging. DCs display an age-related decline in chemotaxis, endocytosis, and global reduction in expression of expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR) 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8, production of IL-12, and antigen presentation, leading to impaired activation of na\u00efve T cells (Table 1) . 8, 29 Paradoxically, DCs from elderly individuals produce a higher basal level of cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-23). In pDCs, reduced expression of TLR7, decreased production of IFN-\u03b1 by TLR stimulation, and impaired phosphorylation of IRF-7 have been shown in older individuals. 30, 31 DCs from aged adults have reduced expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, diminished induction of TLR7 expression, as well as decreased production of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 following WNV infection. This dysregulation is suggested to result from impaired STAT-1 phosphorylation, diminished induction of IRF-1 and IRF-7, and enhanced expression of negative signaling molecules Axl, SOCS1 and PIAS1 in DCs from elderly subjects. 32 These deficits in critical signaling pathways in DC antiviral responses may contribute to the increased susceptibility to WNV infections in the elderly.\n\nNatural Killer (NK) cells are large granular lymphocytes, 10-15% of the circulating lymphocyte pool, that specialize in early defense against virus infections and tumor cells. 33 NK cells recognize abnormal or infected cells through a complex recognition pathway involving both MHC and a repertoire of invariant activating and inhibitory NK receptors.\n\nNK cells maintain extraordinary their functional diversity determined from combinatorial expression of multiple activating and inhibitory receptors. 33, 34 NK cells are classically divided into two major functional subsets (immature and mature) based on the differential expression of surface markers CD56 and CD16: CD56 bright CD16 \u2212 (immature) and CD56 dim CD16 + (mature). 35, 36 Immature NK subsets secrete cytokines and chemokines on activation and following maturation exhibit high cytotoxic capacity. 37 NK cells control viral replication by killing infected cells during the earliest stage of infection, and shape adaptive immune responses through cytokine release or by direct interaction with DCs. [38] [39] [40] An important role for NK cells has been noted previously in many viral infections, such as HIV-1, influenza virus, cytomegalovirus, and hepatitis C virus. [41] [42] [43] In aging, frequency of the immature CD56 bright NK cell subset is reduced (Table 1 ) which may contribute to the impaired production of cytokines and chemokines observed in NK cells of aged subjects. 44 NK cells from older subjects show upregulation of the maturation marker CD57, reduced expression of activating receptors DNAM-1 and NKp30 and NKp46, as well as impaired cytotoxicity and decreased production of granzyme A. 24, 45 Primary human NK cell responses to WNV include activation following interaction of NKp44 receptor with WNV envelope protein 46, 47 ; however deficiency of NK cells did not change morbidity in the murine model. 48, 49 It has been challenging to identify precise changes within the NK cell population in humans since current platforms of flow cytometry are limiting for interrogation of the more than 20 NK receptors expressed per cell. However, the recent development of mass cytometry (CyTOF) provided the first opportunity to simultaneously evaluate NK cell phenotype and function within the context of the overall immune response. Recent studies have used high-dimensional single-cell data to highlight the extreme diversity of the NK cell repertoire as well as to discover the functional significance of NK cell diversity in viral infection. 50 Indeed, the diversity of the NK repertoire increases following infection with either HIV or WNV, leading to terminal differentiation and reduced degranulation and an increased risk of viral acquisition. 51 Thus NK cell diversity may serve as a measure of immunological age and susceptibility, which may precede chronological aging.\n\n\u03b3\u03b4 T Cells an intriguing and enigmatic T cell subset, are present in humans as less than 10% of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (V\u03b41 subset) and in diverse tissues, such as skin, liver, gut epithelial tissue and bronchial epithelia (V\u03b42 subset). 52 \u03b3\u03b4 T cells respond rapidly to antigens from bacteria, parasites and viruses, do not require antigen processing and MHC presentation of peptide epitopes, and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-17. [53] [54] [55] Numbers of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the blood increase in patients with viral infections and potent anti-viral responses include IFN-\u03b3 production and CCR5-mediated migration. 53, [56] [57] [58] In mouse models of WNV infections, although \u03b3\u03b4 T cells produce cytokines involved in inflammation and pathogenesis (IL-17, IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2), deficient mice (TCR\u03b4 \u2212/\u2212 ) are nevertheless more susceptible, showing elevated viremia and more severe encephalitis. This suggests an important role for \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in resistance to WNV infection which remains incompletely understood. 54 In aging, both the frequency and absolute number of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are reduced (Table 1) , stimulated expansion is reduced, and apoptosis is increased, which may contribute to increased susceptibility of older people to WNV infection. [59] [60] [61] \n\nDecline of the adaptive immunity with age has been well established. These changes include decreased pools of na\u00efve T and B cells accompanied by increased memory and effector T and B cells, decreased diversity of antigen receptor repertoire, defective signal transduction in T cells with dysregulated cytokine production pattern, reduced class switching of B cells, and decreased clonal expansion and function of antigen-specific T and B cells. 62, 63 The ageassociated deficits in the CD4 and CD8 T cell response against WNV including impaired production of cytokines and lytic granules, contributing to increased WNV viral titers in the brain of aged mice. 64 Moreover, aged mice show lower levels of primary and memory T and B cell responses induced by vaccination with West Nile encephalitis vaccine, and repeated in vivo restimulation is needed to generate protective cellular and humoral immunity in older populations. 65 Collectively, these observations suggest age-related alterations of adaptive immunity are also relevant for increased WNV susceptibility in the elderly.\n\nRecent advances in technology hold the promise for increasing our understanding of essential changes in immune cells associated with aging, and fostering new discoveries for prevention and therapeutic approaches to improve health. In particular, we highlight mass cytometry to characterize in depth phenotypic and functional changes in multiple cell types simultaneously; and micro RNA (miRNA) profiling to identify miRNAs that regulate expression of pivotal genes relevant to aging-associated conditions. 66,67\n\nMass cytometry, or cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), is a novel technology for multiparametric single cell analysis based on detection of metal-conjugated antibodies. 68 CyTOF improves on fluorescence flow cytometry and has greater dimensionality (40 parameters vs 8-10 by flow cytometry) and resolution of compensation issues. Furthermore, CyTOF can efficiently detect as few as 10,000 cells, which supports investigation from limited samples available through translational and clinical studies. 69 High dimensional data generated from CyTOF requires specialized computational methods for dimensionality reduction, clustering, visualization, and single cell resolution. [70] [71] [72] CyTOF technology is leading to advances in biology and medicine, such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infectious diseases. [73] [74] [75] [76] Emerging studies have employed CyTOF to characterize single cell immune responses to viral infections and vaccination, [77] [78] [79] and promising results in studies of aging advance our understanding of age-associated changes in immune responses. 80, 81 \n\nRecent studies have identified an important role for non-coding short microRNAs (miRNAs, ~22 nucleotides) in posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by binding to specific mRNA targets and facilitating their degradation and/or translational inhibition. The human genome is believed to encode ~1,000 miRNAs, each of which may regulate expression of hundreds of genes. 67 Emerging evidence has shown that expression of dozens of miRNAs are altered with aging in different tissues and organisms, which may be associated with agedependent diseases and disorders. 82, 83 Interestingly, several key immune-regulated miRNAs such as miR-21, -146a, and -155, also show alterations during aging, suggesting that miRNAs may contribute to the age-associated basal inflammation. 82, [84] [85] [86] Cellular miRNAs have also been implicated in restriction or promotion of infection of various viruses, including Hepatitis C virus (miR-122) and retrovirus primate foamy virus type 1 (miR-32). 87, 88 Several miRNAs including miR-196a, -202-3p, -449c, and -125a-3p have been shown to be differentially expressed following WNV infection, suggesting their potential role in WNV resistance and pathogenesis. 89,90 miRNA profiling will lead us to a better understanding of miRNA regulation in aging and viral infections as well as new discoveries for miRNA-based therapeutic intervention.\n\nAging remains a dominant risk factor for susceptibility to infection with WNV 4 , and agingassociated changes in innate and adaptive immunity may contribute to increased illness among the elderly. As reviewed here, dysregulation of TLR pathways in macrophages 23 , reduced production of IFN by dendritic cells 32 , and reduced efficiency of PMN clearance of virus 9 may contribute to the increased susceptibility to WNV infection in elderly individuals. In addition, in-depth investigations are needed to identify whether age-related differences in NK cells and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells may also be relevant to control of WNV infection in humans. Emerging technologies including single cell CyTOF and miRNA profiling provide multidimensional, high-throughput, genome-and proteome-wide analysis of age-associated changes in cell function and may offer new insights into pathogenesis of age-related diseases or disorders for development of promising preventive and therapeutic approaches.
