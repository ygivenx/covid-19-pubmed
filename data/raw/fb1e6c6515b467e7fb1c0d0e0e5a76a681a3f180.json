{"title": "Emerging respiratory tract infections 4 Rapid point of care diagnostic tests for viral and bacterial respiratory tract infections-needs, advances, and future prospects", "body": "Respiratory tract infections are caused by many viral and bacterial pathogens 1 and are the second most common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. 2-4 Lower respiratory tract infections come second in the global burden of disease rankings after ischaemic heart disease. 1,4 Surveillance reports 5 from Europe show a substantial rise in the number of infections caused by antimicrobial resistant bacteria. Community acquired pneumonia, 6 hospital-acquired pneumonia, and ventilator associated pneumonia 7 all continue to present clinically signifi cant diagnostic and management challenges. Additionally, the worldwide spread of multi drug resistant tuberculosis 8 and emergence of multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, 9, 10 for which few eff ective therapy options exist, are a major concern. Respiratory tract infections are also the most common infections in an ever increasing number of immunocompromised people 11 in whom a broader diff erential diagnosis of opportunistic microorganisms presents further diagnostic challenges. 12 Successful treatment outcomes for respiratory tract infections presenting in all types of health-care settings will only be achieved with rapid, sensitive, and specifi c identifi cation of pathogens and antibiotic resistance profi les to allow eff ective evidence-based antimicrobial therapy and pathogen-specifi c infection control measures. 13 The presence of microbial nucleic acids in respiratory tract samples has been exploited for amplifi cation of targets to identify microbes and antibiotic resistance. In this review, we describe the available diagnostic tests for viral and bacterial causes of respiratory tract infections \u2022 Millions of adults and children worldwide continue to die of treatable respiratory tract infections caused by a wide range of microbial pathogens. \u2022 The emergence of multi-antibiotic resistant bacteria and novel respiratory viruses with pandemic potential is of global concern. \u2022 Optimum clinical management outcomes can be achieved only through rapid accurate diagnosis of the microbial cause of respiratory tract infections and initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy. \u2022 The presence of microbial nucleic acids in respiratory tract samples has been exploited for amplifi cation of microbe species and antibiotic resistance specifi c genetic targets \u2022 Molecular diagnostic platforms allow for rapid diagnostic tests to be modelled on automated platforms using nucleic acid amplifi cation techniques (NAAT). The clinical dilemma surrounding the use of high sensitivity and specifi city NAATs is that identifi cation of pathogen nucleic acid from a respiratory tract sample may not necessarily attribute causation. \u2022 Few validated NAAT tests that screen for respiratory tract infections caused by specifi c viral or bacterial groups are being used by diagnostic laboratories to diagnose selected pathogens, usually in combination with more traditional methods. \u2022 Laboratories in most developing countries use traditional age-old methods for diagnosis of respiratory tract infections except for the Cepheid GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay, which is being rolled out worldwide for rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance. \u2022 Microarray-based multiplexing and nucleic-acid-based deep-sequencing methods for the simultaneous detection of pathogen nucleic acid and multiple antibiotic resistance provide further hope for revolutionising rapid point-of-care tuberculosis diagnostics, and they have been invaluable in identifying new viral and bacterial pathogens. \u2022 Despite advances, a great need for rapid, point-of-care pathogen-specifi c, sensitive, and aff ordable diagnostics remains for the advancement of clinical management, infection control, and improved public health response to emerging pathogens.\n\nand developments in technologies that off er the potential for improving the quality, speed, and tractability of near point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests.\n\nWhen patients with respiratory tract infections present at any point of care, diagnostic tests should be available to simultaneously diff erentiate bacterial (including tuberculosis), viral, and other microbial causes to achieve the best possible treatment outcomes. At present, patients presenting with acute respiratory tract infections are started on empiric antimicrobial treatment for presumed acute bacterial infection rather than therapy directed at the causal organism. 14 The major drawback in the clinical management of respiratory tract infections worldwide nowadays is the absence of standardised, rapid, accurate, specifi c point-ofcare diagnostic tests able to screen for major pathogen groups, to enable identi fi cation of the causative organisms, and to ascertain anti microbial susceptibilities. 13 Present advances in molecular technologies off er a unique opportunity to address this unmet need. 15 New lethal viruses and bacteria causing respiratory tract infections, several with epidemic potential, have emerged in the past 10 years, threatening global health security and attracting widespread media and political attention. These include the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV [2003]), 16 swine-origin infl uenza A (H1N1pdm2009), 17 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV [2012]), 18 multi drug resistant and extensively-drug resistant tuberculosis, 19 pan-drug resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, 7,9,10 antiviral resistant cyto megalovirus strains in immunocompromised patients, 20 and azole-resistant fungi. 21 Other newly emergent respiratory pathogen threats that merit close monitoring for expanding epidemic potential include avian infl uenza A H7N9, 22 infl uenza A swine H3N2v and H1N1v variant, 23 human adenovirus 14p1, 24 and rhinovirus group C, 25 each of which have caused localised outbreaks of great concern.\n\nWhenever a previously unknown potentially lethal microorganism causing respiratory tract infection emerges, clinicians, microbiologists, and public health offi cials are expected to work synergistically together with national and global health systems to respond to the threat. This response has many components: rapid diagnosis and identifi cation of similar cases; case control studies to determine reservoirs, modes of transmission, and risk factors; collection of individual and case cluster data and reports; ascertainment of transmission patterns; isolation, identifi cation, and characterisation of the specifi c pathogen, and establishment of Koch's postulates if possible; and development of pathogen-specifi c diagnostics and genome sequencing to monitor the evolution and transmission patterns. These collaborative activities are essential for the identifi cation of the specifi c microorganism, guidance of appropriate targeted therapy, monitoring of response to treatment, prediction of prognosis, guidance of infection control measures, and public health surveillance and control recommendations. Rapid, accurate diagnostic laboratory tests are crucial in the public health management of respiratory tract infections caused by new potentially lethal pathogens.\n\nThe requirements for ideal point-of-care and near-patient testing for respiratory tract infections are similar (table 1) but may diff er according to specifi c needs of the healthcare setting. Several diagnostic platforms and tests have great potential to improve management of respiratory tract infections. 26, 27 Furthermore, these are becoming increasingly important in response to outbreaks of respiratory tract infections caused by zoonotic pathogens, which jump the species barrier and have epidemic potential. [28] [29] [30] Several commercial diagnostic tests and platforms that incorporate the above technologies and promise to substantially reduce turnaround times for diagnosis of a host of microbial infections, including those of the respiratory tract, are on the market or in development (table 2) . Typically, these are on automated or semiautomated systems or kits that integrate sample preparation, pathogen detection, and identifi cation of antimicrobial resistance genes, providing an automated read-out of results. These tests and platforms are the most advanced systems requiring the least possible user input throughout the process and are capable of detecting several pathogens simultaneously. Depending on the test, single or multiple pathogens, or antimicrobial resistances may be detected. Such systems can off er not only an improved speed of diagnosis but also increased sensitivity of detection. However, the development of such tests and their successful implementation into clinical practice requires further development. [31] [32] [33] Where the accuracy of results is high with multiplex tests, the desirable characteristics for providing both diagnostic and epidemiological information become convergent, and routine diagnostic laboratories can consider fulfi lling a public health role. 34 Molecular multiplex tests need to be transported outside the laboratory as point-of-care tests in busy tertiary care, outpatient clinical settings, or rural areas in developing countries. From this point, the basic requirements of a method may diverge: for fi eld studies, the adopted amplifi cation technology may need to be something more suited to situations where power supply cannot be guaranteed, such as isothermal amplifi cation. For all point-of-care tests, operational simplicity allowing use by non-laboratory trained staff and accurate interpretation of raw signal data are key factors.\n\nBefore the advent of laboratory tests, the practice of medicine was an art, and making a diagnosis of respiratory infection relied entirely on the taking of Series medical histories and physical examinations. 35 The discovery of the microscope by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) was the fi rst step towards the development of laboratory diagnostic tests for respiratory tract infections with microscopic examination of stained sputum coupled with sputum culture on agar 37 followed by liquid-culture methods. Further refi nement of bacterial and viral culture methods improved the ability to detect specifi c pathogens and identify their susceptibility testing against specifi c antimicrobials, although the time needed for culture growth (24-72 h) did not infl uence treatment decisions on admission. These diagnostic methods did not change until the late 1980s when major advances in molecular biology, immunology, genomics, and technical engineering led to many new diagnostic tests. Serological tests for detection of microbial antigen or antibody, agglutination tests, com plement fi xation tests, fl uorescent antibody tests, radio immunoassay, and ELISA have been developed for various pathogens without any great infl uence on clinical management of respiratory tract infections at points of care. 38 The most relevant development has been the use of nucleic acid amplifi cation techniques (NAAT) for respiratory tract infection diagnostics. 39 The presence of microbial nucleic acids in respiratory tract samples (sputum, nasopharyngeal swabs, tracheal aspirates, and bronchoalveolar lavage) has been exploited for amplifi cation of microbe-specifi c genetic targets. 26, 27 This was initially labour intensive and NAAT technologies have evolved to real time PCR (rtPCR), loop-mediated amplifi cation (LAMP), nucleic acid sequence-based amplifi cation, and strand displacement amplifi cation, the latter three methods avoiding thermocycling.\n\nBefore the introduction of NAATs, the mainstay of diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections was largely based on serology; consisting of a combination of detecting substantial antibody rises with complement-fi xation tests, detection of viral antigen by immuno fl uorescence or colorimetric methods, and virus isolation in cell culture, often with blind passage followed by secondary detection with immunofl uorescence or haemadsorption. 40, 41 The older generation tests for viruses are still useful today in scenarios in which the time to results is not crucial. 42 During the past two decades, the sensitivity and specifi city of tests to detect viral respiratory pathogens have been improved by developments in genome amplifi cation. Several new respiratory viruses have been 18 Multiplex PCR assays identify several diff erent viruses in a single test. 34 Several multiplex PCR tests are now commercially available, and these are constantly being refi ned and assessed. Basic laboratory diagnosis of viral causes of respiratory tract infections is being coupled to subtyping, 49 antiviral drug resistance, 50 nucleotide polymorphisms, 51 and, together with viral load assays, 52 provide extensive information for optimum treatment of respiratory tract infections.\n\nThe clinical usefulness of a test was determined by the relative degrees of sensitivity and specifi city and the time taken to obtain a result. Monoclonal-antibody direct fl uorescent antibody tests usually had adequate specifi city for a particular virus, but there was a trade-off between turnaround time and sensitivity. Thus, although some of the colorimetric tests for direct antigen detection had a turnaround time of less than an hour, sensitivity could be around 70%. 51 Further developments in reaction chemistry have enabled the targeted amplifi cation of other viruses in the same reaction, while keeping sensitivity and specifi city high and the turnaround time still relevant to clinical need. Available versions of in-house and commercially developed multiplex tests off er potential amplifi cation of up to 20 pathogens from a clinical sample, 26, 40, 45 although for some of these the turnaround time approaches a whole working day. Several head-to-head comparisons of inhouse and commercial tests have been published. 43, 44, [46] [47] [48] \n\nThe advantage of multiplex tests is that they increase the chance of identifying the microbial causes of respiratory tract infections and can detect more than one pathogen at a single time point when there are coinfections 52 The diffi culty lies with interpreting the fi ndings in relation to a patient's clinical status. Detection of a weak signal of one virus may represent a commensal or the tail-end of a previous infection, although it may also show that the infection is recent and evolving. Another possibility is that the weaker signal is a pronounced viral infection in the lower respiratory tract, but the virus is not yet well represented in the upper respiratory tract, where there is a diff erent viral infection present. The issue of which clinical sample will generate the highest diagnostic yield is also dependent on the pathogenesis of the virus. The rapid development of multiplex tests may have outstripped their clinical need, and rather than provide clinicians with useful information, clinical interpretation and decision making might have become more complex. A demonstration of how challenging interpretation of virus identifi cations from multiplex PCRs can be is shown by a prospective study of neonates in an intensive care unit. 53 Over 1 year, although some morbidity outcomes were associated with respiratory virus infec tions, infections were also commonly detected in the absence of clinical illness.\n\nDespite advances in technology, the gold standard diagnostic technique for respiratory tract infections of bacterial cause is traditional culture, followed by identifi cation and antimicrobial susceptibility testing by various manual or automated methods. 27 Individual diagnostic laboratories may use molecular methods (developed either in-house or externally) for part of the detection process. Such supplementary methods are often aimed at organisms that are diffi cult or take a long time to culture, such as Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. 31 \n\nThe laboratory diagnosis of the specifi c bacterial cause of respiratory tract infections is notoriously diffi cult. Up to 30% of gold-standard culture tests do not identify a cause because of the existence of unknown pathogens and poor accuracy and sensitivity. 59 Rapid, molecular diagnostic assays based on detection of nucleic acid off er a potential solution to this problem. 60 Accurate and comprehensive detection of antimicrobial resistance with these techniques is fraught with diffi culty owing to the multitude of antimicrobial resistance determinants in existence and limited capability of multiplexing for PCRbased technology. 58,61\n\nDespite apparent development activity in this area, very few platforms and tests are on the market, and few clinical evaluations of such tests have been published (table 3) . 62 66 No licensed GeneXpert test for bacterial lower respiratory tract infection exist, although a study 65, 70 has reported the use of this platform to detect S aureus in respiratory samples. The study examined 135 endotracheal aspirates from suspected ventilator associated pneumonia showing the presence of Gram-positive cocci by microscopy and compared the results with those from both qualitative and quantitative traditional culture. Although the researchers reported good specifi city compared with qualitative culture (89\u00b77%), microscopy performed poorly compared with quantitative culture (72\u00b72%). 62, 67 At present, most laboratories report quantitative results and generally defi ne counts of 10\u2074-10\u2075 colony-forming units/mL as signifi cant infection, and lower counts presumed to show colonisation and contamination. 37 \n\nConventional whole genome sequencing (WGS) requires prior knowledge of the pathogen whereas next generation sequencing (NGS) methods can sequence all genomic material present in a sample. 70 NGS has the ability to sequence many microbial genomes and deliver and interpret the resultant sequence information in near realtime. Thus, NGS provides an unbiased approach for detection of any pathogen present in a clinical sample, its antibiotic resistance genes, and for new pathogen discovery. NGS methods provide sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities, and off er many potential advantages to diagnostic microbiology laboratories for rapid detection of drug resistance and timely identifi cation of nosocomial transmission of a range of bacterial and viral pathogens. [71] [72] [73] Therefore, conventional methods are poor for detection of low-level drug resistance mutations, which contribute to phenotypic antimicrobial and antiviral resistance. The need for amplicons limits the length of sequence and thus the usefulness of Sanger methods 74 for pathogen genotyping in outbreaks.\n\nNGS methods can be harnessed for sequencing multiple diff erent pathogens in a single sample or multiple samples in the same run. Barcoding technology, 75 which labels each sample with a unique identifi er, can be used to simultaneously sequence multiple samples from patients infected with the same pathogen. Several developments are needed before use of NGS becomes more widespread, such as improving the sensitivity of pathogen sequencing directly from clinical material and development of tractable software for practical use. 72 Methods that can obviate the necessity for prior culture or PCR amplifi cation for enriching target pathogens are needed. A European funded consortium, PATHSEEK, is investigating high multiplicity multiplexing and multiplexing of many diff erent pathogens in the same reaction, 76 using NGS methods with bespoke software for sequencing of whole pathogen genome, including infl uenza and tuberculosis, directly from clinical material. 73 Alternative approaches retain the unbiased nature of NGS, opting instead for unselective deep sequencing of RNA transcripts isolated from clinical material, thereby capturing RNA and DNA pathogens and discovering new agents. The advent of nano technologies such as nanopore sequencing and mobile devices promising rapid turnaround times, small footprints, and decreased costs brings us closer to the possibility that near-patient pathogen genome sequencing and data interpretation will be available within the near future.\n\nBy contrast with Sanger methods, 74 NGS is able to generate more sequence-data per run, detecting multiple resistance mutations simultaneously, even when these occur in noncontiguous genes. NGS methods 70 can sequence longer regions in a single assay, including whole pathogen genomes, which are particularly powerful for phylogenetic analyses to identify pathogen transmission and for outbreak-monitoring. Although many diff erent NGS methodologies are now available, the principles-namely, unbiased sequencing of popu lations (libraries) of amplifi ed DNA-template molecules is common to most pathogens. Advances of next generation methods include PacBio and Nanopore, which can sequence from single molecules to provide read lengths of thousands of bases long and throughput with higher overall error rates. NGS methods can be harnessed for sequencing multiple diff erent pathogens in a single sample or multiple samples in the same run. 70 The challenge for the identifi cation of antimicrobial resistance, particularly in complex multi drug resistant organisms, will be to rapidly assemble and analyse the generated data. This will require the construction of robust databases and data analysis algorithms 77 that can rapidly equate a genome with a likely antimicrobial resistance profi le.\n\nMERS is a newly described human disease predominantly aff ecting the respiratory tract. It was fi rst reported from Saudi Arabia in September, 2012, after identifi cation of MERS-CoV (a novel betacoronavirus) from a patient in Jeddah who died from a severe respiratory illness. 18 Subsequently, several community and hospital-based studies defi ned the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and spectrum of clinical presentations from the mild to severe, including the relationship of rapidly fulminant disease with comorbid medical disorders. 78 \n\nand case-controlled studies of the population in aff ected countries are urgently needed to further examine spread, prevalence, and transmission of MERS-CoV. WGS has been useful for studying viral transmission and evolution. [79] [80] [81] Several studies, 87-89 based on nucleic acid detection assays, found closely related coronaviruses in diff erent species of bat in Africa, Saudi Arabia, and north America. Comparison of PCR, with serological methods on livestock animals from MERS-CoV, showed that dromedary camels harbour MERS-CoV neutralising antibodies, 98 and this fi nding was verifi ed by studies of camels on farms where human MERS rtPCR-confi rmed cases occurred. 86 A report 107 showed identical MERS-CoV sequences obtained from a patient who died of laboratoryconfi rmed MERS and those obtained from a dromedary camel with rhinorrhoea that the patient had contact with.\n\nAn estimated 3 million of the world's 8\u00b78 million cases of pulmonary tuberculosis are not diagnosed and thus are still untreated, continuing to spread the disease in the community. In 2012, of an estimated 450 000 cases of multidrug resistant tuberculosis worldwide, 80% were undiagnosed. 108 Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis present with respiratory symptoms and receive repeated courses of antibiotics before being screened for tuberculosis. The continued use of century-old sputum microscopy and the time required for traditional culturebased diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, coupled with the large global health burden and associated mortality of tuberculosis, led to focused global eff orts on new rapid and more sensitive tuberculosis diagnostics (table 5). The past 5 years have seen an unprecedented activity in development of a range of new diagnostic tests based on culture, molecular, and non-molecular methods by scores of small-to-medium sized enterprises. A major concern is that not all marketed tests have been assessed rigorously for diagnostic accuracy, robustness under operational conditions in the fi eld, cost-eff ectiveness, and practical usefulness.\n\nNew point-of-care, near-patient innovations in tuberculosis diagnostics have several targets: rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis and identifi cation of rifampicin resistance with Xpert MTB/RIF assay identifi cation of multidrug resistant tuberculosis with the Hain Genotype multidrug resistant Plus System, and routine prospective variable number of tandem repeats-mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (VNTR-MIRU) typing to allow prioritisation of cases for contact tracing. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay, which uses the Cepheid GeneXpert system, has been a forerunner in rapid molecular pointof-care diagnostics. 115, [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] [137] The results of sputum analysis are available in 2 h, and operationally within 24 h. 136, 137 Numerous assessment studies at several points of care have shown that the assay is sensitive and specifi c and has increased detection of smear-negative patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (table 4) . 115, 137 However, this diagnostic improvement does not always lead to better clinical outcomes. In a randomised multicentre trial of clinical outcomes of with Xpert MTB/RIF assay, although a high proportion of patients started treatment on the day of presentation, there was no signifi cant improvement in lowering of tuberculosis related morbidity; the researchers suggested that the lack of benefi t was a result of eff ective empirical management in the control group. 134 Other promising test platforms are being introduced for detection of M tuberculosis aligning improved functionality at point of care, increased accuracy of detection, and developing more drug resistance targets. [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] Although tuberculosis-centric diagnostic test development is important, it is prudent to realise that it might not fi t into the longer term goals of optimum converging delivery of health care for both non communicable and other communicable diseases, which is moving away from disease-specifi c silos.\n\nAlthough genotypic analysis of drug-resistant strains of M tuberculosis is possible, limitations in laboratory methods exist, such as faster and more accurate determination of the antimicrobial resistance phenotype, which need to be overcome. Direct sequencing from sputum requires prior pathogen enrichment by culture or other enrichment methods. Microarray-based multi plexing and nucleic-acidbased deep sequencing methods, for the simultaneous detection of M tuberculosis DNA and multiple drug resistance to several fi rst-line and second-line tuberculosis drugs, now provide further hope in revolutionising rapidpoint-of-care tuberculosis diagnostics. Next generation benchtop sequencing systems have the potential to allow for M tuberculosis sequencing for resistances to all fi rst-line and second-line tuberculosis drugs direct from sputum 76 and could overcome the problem of low bacterial loads in sputum and provide a timescale weeks quicker than culture-based resistance testing. There is also a need for comprehensive mapping of antimicrobial resistance mutations and bespoke software for easy interpretation of resistance assays. WGS approaches linked with quantitative bacteriology will generate comprehensive genotype-phenotype correlations across all the multidrug resistant M tuberculosis isolates and provide the opportunity to extract genome data exploitable for both development of point-of-care diagnostic tests coupled to drug resistance screening, and for epidemiological and public health control purposes.\n\nSeveral manufacturers are developing potentially relevant diagnostic technologies that are beginning to enter the market. [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] There is a need to improve our understanding of the role of individual microorganisms in respiratory disease and the true relationship between pathogen quantity and disease. A major challenge of implementation of molecular testing technology will be the ability of the test to distinguish between microbial colonisation, Series infection, and disease causation. Standard laboratory culture generally incudes a quantitative element, with a usual cut-off being 10\u2075 CFU/mL. Respiratory tract specimens are invariably contaminated with colonising organisms from the nasopharynx and the increased sensitivity of molecular techniques will detect such colonisers. Additionally, multiple pathogenic species can be present in one specimen. The extent to which these represent genuine co-infections as opposed to a mixture of infection and colonisation needs to be determined. The diffi culty in distinguishing between infection and colonisation creates a dilemma as to whether such results should be used to guide treatment. Incorporation of a quantitative element to diagnostics, such as use of quantitative PCR will go some way towards improved interpretation. At present, the biggest technology gap exists within the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections and these are now the focus of consortia partnerships funded by the EU and the Innovative Medicines Initiative such as PATHSEEK, 76 rapid identifi cation of respiratory tract infections (RiD-RTI), 140 and development of rapid pointof-care test platforms for infectious diseases (RAPP-ID). 141 The aim of the RiD-RTI consortium is to develop a rapid sample-in, answer-out nucleic-acid-based platform for the diagnosis of all types of pneumonia (community acquired pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, and ventilator associated pneumonia) caused by viral and bacterial pathogens 140 while RAPP-ID proposes to use various technologies to develop point-of-care tests for infl uenza, ventilator associated pneumonia, and community acquired pneumonia. 141 \n\nWe searched for articles published in English in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane database, Google scholar, and WHO publications website with the terms \"respiratory tract\", \"lung\"', \"infections\" and combined these with the terms \"diagnostics\", \"diagnostic tests\", \"diagnostic platforms\", \"PCR\", \"serology\", \"rapid\", \"molecular\", \"antibiotic resistance\", \"sequencing\" \"point of care\", and \"development\" for the period between March 21, 2000, and June 4, 2014. Substantive reviews identifi ed on the subject have been referenced. \n\nof good quality point-of-care products for diagnosis of respiratory tract infections is hoped and expected to be available on the market in the next 5 years. As further developments in NAAT tests progress, further coanalyses of several viral and bacterial targets will be possible. Fully automated multiplex NAAT tests such as GeneXpert, 67 Nanosphere, and FilmArray 64, 69 are only suitable for low throughput scenarios; although for Nanosphere technology, some modest scale-up is possible by the addition of up to 16 processing modules. Batched processing of validated NAAT tests to diagnose some pathogens is usually done in combination with more traditional microbiological methods. In the future, a three-point arrangement for cost-eff ective rapid diagnosis of respiratory tract infection might be possible. The fi rst point is a low throughput, fully automated NAAT platform, situated as a point-of-care test in primarycare or secondary-care emergency areas, where tests are done by clinical staff , and provide out-of-hours diagnostic information to manage admission of patients and infection control practice. The second stage is a robust in-house or commercial NAAT test of large batch size to provide the main diagnostic laboratory capacity for managing the signifi cant and varied range of targeted respiratory tract infection requests that are generated within a secondary care setting. The third point, which is not yet well established as a diagnostic pathway, is a pathogendiscovery process formed by an initial non-targeted amplifi cation of polyadenylated RNA in a clinical sample, then an array-based selection of potential pathogens. The sequencing of any captured structures might have a much longer turnaround time, but would provide a fi nal opportunity to obtain a diagnosis where no result could be obtained via the fi rst or second point. This three-point diagnostic process would provide the maximum opportunity for obtaining relevant diagnostic information.\n\nThe fi rst of the fully automated NAAT platforms are in the early stages of commercialisation, and should these platforms prove successful they will likely be rapidly adopted by health-care systems worldwide. However, the third, so-called pathogen-discovery approach has not yet been developed for clinical use, and it might be some time before the proposed scenario becomes a reality. The use of automation and reliability improvements will facilitate testing out of the laboratory and toward the interface between patients and clinicians at points of care and ideally, in rural areas in developing countries, run on solar power.\n\nSeveral technological advances are showing great promise, and although substantial progress is being made in the development of new pathogen-specifi c rapid diagnostic tests, there are issues of interpretation, sensitivity, and specifi city that need to be resolved. The clinical dilemma surrounding the use of high sensitivity and specifi city NAATs is that identifi cation of pathogen nucleic acid from a respiratory tract sample might not necessarily attribute causation.\n\nIn practical management terms, for patients with respiratory tract infection at any point of care, a rapid diagnostic test is needed which, from a single respiratory tract sample, can distinguish bacterial from viral infection, identify any bacteria to the species level, and delineate antibiotic sensitivities. Such a test would enable prompt initiation of pathogen-specifi c treatment, or enable the prompt modifi cation of empiric antibiotic therapy, and thus improve management and outcomes of patients presenting with respiratory tract infection. For any new test to be widely adopted it should be possible to power with solar energy and use reagents should not require cold chain storage.\n\nAZ wrote and coordinated this Series paper, developed the draft outline, contributed his sections and fi nalised the manuscript.
