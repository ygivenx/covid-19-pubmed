{"title": "Ring finger protein 166 potentiates RNA virus-induced interferon-\u03b2 production via enhancing the ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6", "body": "RNF166 is closely related to RNF125, which has been reported to negatively regulate RIG-I- mediated anti-RNA virus signaling by conjugating ubiquitin chains to RIG-I and leading to the degradation of RIG-I by the proteasome23. RNF125 and its homologous proteins RNF114, RNF138, and RNF166 form a subfamily of small C3HC4 RING ubiquitin ligases28, so we investigated whether RNF114/138/166 also play a role in RNA virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 production. We transfected plasmids that encoded RNF114, RNF125, RNF138, and RNF166 into HEK293T cells to perform reporter assays. We found that overexpression of RNF166 but not it\u2019s homologous RNF114, 125, and 138, potentiated Sendai virus (SeV)-induced activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter. However, RNF166 had no apparent effect on the overexpression of cGAS and the STING-induced activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter (Fig. 1A), suggesting that RNF166 specifically enhances RNA but not DNA virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 production. Overexpression of RNF166 can also enhance the transcription of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) like ISG15 and MX1 (Fig. 1B).\n\nTo determine whether endogenous RNF166 is involved in anti-RNA virus signaling, we generated stable RNF166-knockdown cell pools using shRNA plasmids that targeted five sites on human RNF166 mRNA. Two shRNA plasmids (#4 and #5) markedly inhibited the expression of endogenous RNF166 mRNA in HEK293T cells, whereas the #1, #2, and #3 shRNA plasmids had little effect on RNF166 mRNA (Fig. 1C). We found that knockdown of RNF166 significantly inhibited the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter, transcription of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA, and the secretion of IFN-\u03b2 triggered by SeV infection (Fig. 1D,E). We also generated stable RNF114-, RNF125-, and RNF138-knockdown HEK293T cell pools to determine their functions (Fig. 1F). Consistent with a previous report that RNF125 acts as a negative regulator of the RIG-I-mediated signaling pathway23, knockdown of RNF125 slightly enhanced the SeV-elicited IFN-\u03b2 production compared to the control cell pool, while knockdown of RNF114 clearly enhanced the SeV-induced IFN-\u03b2 production, and knockdown of RNF138 had no appreciable effect (Fig. 1G).\n\nWe further generated stable RNF166-knockdown cell pools with HeLa cells and obtained similar results; the production of IFN-\u03b2 induced by SeV, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and human influenza A virus infection, as well as poly (I:C)-transfection notably decreased when endogenous RNF166 expression was knocked down (Fig. 1H\u2013K). However, knockdown of RNF166 had no effect on DNA analog-induced activation of IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 1L). These results suggested that RNF166 rather than its homologous proteins physiologically potentiates RNA virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 production.\n\nWe next determined which molecules are targets of RNF166 in the anti-RNA virus signaling pathway. In reporter assays, overexpression of RNF166 potentiated VISA-, but not the downstream kinase TBK1-mediated activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter (Fig. 2A). Repoter Assay and Bioassay results showed that RNF166 but not the other RNFs potentiated VISA-mediated transcription and secretion of IFN-\u03b2, while the overexpression of RNF114 or RNF125 had inhibitory effects (Fig. 2B). Accordingly, knockdown of RNF166 inhibited VISA- but not TBK1-mediated activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter (Fig. 2C). These data suggested that RNF166 acts on signaling components that are downstream of VISA and upstream of TBK1.\n\nWe next used co-immunoprecipitation to determine whether RNF166 interacts with VISA and its downstream components. Overexpressed RNF166 markedly associated with TRAF3 and TRAF6 in 293T cells, and also interacted with VISA, but had no detectable interactions with RIG-I, MDA5, TBK1, and IRF3 (Fig. 2D). RNF166 was subsequently shown to co-localize with TRAF3 and TRAF6 in co-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 2E). Overexpressed RNF166 localized predominantly in the cytosol as dots which were probably aggregates of RNF166 protein. Double immunofluorescent staining showed that overexpressed TRAF6/3, especially TRAF6, had a similar distribution pattern and overlapped with RNF166, while we did not detect co-localization between RNF166 and VISA.\n\nTo define these interactions under physiological conditions, we set out to determine associations between endogenous RNF166 and the targets. As we could not obtain an effective antibody to detect endogenous RNF166 through preparation or commercial purchase, we performed immunoprecipitation between overexpressed RNF166 and endogenous TRAF3 and TRAF6 with or without SeV infection. Overexpressed RNF166 weakly interacted with endogenous TRAF3 and TRAF6, and SeV infection greatly enhanced these interactions (Fig. 2F). These data suggested that RNF166 associates with TRAF3 and TRAF6 during viral infection.\n\nTo further clarify whether RNF166 targets TRAF3 and TRAF6, we used shRNA to knockdown endogenous TRAF3 or TRAF6, and found that RNF166 no longer potentiated VISA-induced IFN-\u03b2 activation when TRAF3 or TRAF6 expression was suppressed (Fig. 2G). These data further supported the idea that RNF166 targets TRAF3 and TRAF6 to potentiate RNA virus-induced IFN-\u03b2 production.\n\nThat TRAF3 acts as a critical adaptor in RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling has been demonstrated by several studies2930, but its role has been doubted recently13. So we then determined whether TRAF3 or TRAF6 plays a critical role in SeV-induced IFN-\u03b2 production by using shRNA to stably knock down endogenous TRAF3 or TRAF6 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A). We found that VISA-mediated activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter, SeV-induced transcription, and the secretion of IFN-\u03b2 were markedly reduced (Figs 2G and 3B), and SeV-induced phosphorylation and dimerization of IRF3 was apparently inhibited when TRAF3 or TRAF6 expression was suppressed (Fig. 3C).\n\nTo further determine the function of TRAF3 and TRAF6, we generated TRAF3 or TRAF6 knockout HEK293T cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Fig. 3D). Phosphorylation of IRF3 triggered by SeV-infection was greatly inhibited and the production of IFN-\u03b2 was blocked when TRAF3 or TRAF6 was deleted (Fig. 3E,F). These results suggested that both TRAF3 and TRAF6 play a critical role in SeV-induced IFN-\u03b2 production in HEK293T cells.\n\nRNF166 contains a RING domain, a zinc finger domain, and an ubiquitin-binding domain (UIM) (Fig. 4A). To dissect the functional role of these domains, we generated three deletion mutants and assessed their ability to up-regulate SeV-induced IFN-\u03b2 production. We found that the presence of an intact RING domain is essential for RNF166 function, as overexpression of a RING deletion mutant (RNF166 \u0394RING) failed to enhance, but rather inhibited the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter induced by SeV and the overexpression of VISA, while the UIM domain deletion mutant (RNF166 \u2206UIM) had no apparent effect (Fig. 4B,C). Consistently, on infection with NDV-eGFP (Newcastle disease virus-enhanced green fluorescent protein), we found that overexpression of RNF166 in HEK293T cells rendered them remarkably resistant to NDV infection and reduced the levels of NDV-eGFP-positive cells, while the RING deletion mutant had the opposite effect (Fig. 4D); and the same results were obtained when RNF166 or RNF166 \u0394RING were co-expressed with VISA. Also we found overexpression of RNF166 can inhibit the replication of SeV (measured by mRNA level of SeV P protein), while the RING delete mutant enhanced the proliferation of SeV (Fig. 4E). These data indicated that the RING domain is indispensable for the ability of RNF166 to up-regulate cellular anti-RNA virus activity.\n\nWe further performed co-immunoprecipitation to detect which domain of RNF166 is required for interactions with TRAF3 and TRAF6. The results showed that the RING deletion and UIM deletion mutants interacted with TRAF3/6 just like full-length RNF166, while the mutant carrying the RING domain only did not (Fig. 4F), suggesting RNF166 interacts with TRAF3 and TRAF6 via its zinc finger domain, and the RING domain is necessary for its positive regulatory function.\n\nIt is known that the RING domain is the critical functional domain for E3 ubiquitin ligase, and polyubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6 are important for RLR signaling1327, so we suggested that RNF166 could affect the ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6. We found overexpressed RNF166 enhanced the ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6 in co-transfection experiments, consistent with previous results, and RNF166 lost this effect when the RING domain was deleted (Fig. 5A).\n\nWe then found that the SeV-induced ubiquitination of endogenous TRAF3 and TRAF6 was notably inhibited when RNF166 expression was suppressed (Fig. 5B,C). We further found that K63-linked rather than K48-linked ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6 was decreased upon SeV infection when RNF166 was knocked down (Fig. 5B,C). However, we did not find an apparent effect of knockdown of endogenous RNF114 and RNF138 on SeV-induced ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6 (Fig. 5D,E). These data suggested that endogenous RNF166 rather than its homologous proteins RNF114 and RNF138 specifically enhances the SeV-induced ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6.\n\nVirus-triggered production of IFN-\u03b2 is critical for the antiviral immune response and is delicately regulated in space and time by various molecules and distinct mechanisms. Ubiquitination has emerged as a critical role in forming signaling complexes and transducing signals downstream13.\n\nRNF125 has been reported to negatively regulate RIG-I-mediated antiviral activity via conjugating ubiquitin chains to RIG-I and MDA5, leading to their degradation by the proteasome. However, the functions of its homologous proteins RNF114, RNF125, and RNF138 in innate immune signaling pathways remain elusive. Here, we report that RNF166 rather than RNF114, RNF138, and RNF125 potentiates the RNA virus-induced production of IFN-\u03b2. Several lines of evidence support this finding. First, overexpressed RNF166 potentiated the SeV- and VISA-mediated induction of IFN-\u03b2. Second, knockdown of endogenous RNF166 by shRNA reduced the RNA virus- and dsRNA analog-induced production of IFN-\u03b2. Third, RNF166 interacted with endogenous TRAF3 and TRAF6, and these interactions were enhanced upon viral infection. Furthermore, we found that the potentiation of the antiviral effect of RNF166 was mediated by enhancing the virus-induced ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6. Notably, endogenous RNF114 and RNF138 had no apparent effect on the virus-induced ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6, and this finding may explain why RNF114 and RNF138 do not enhance SeV-induced antiviral activity while RNF166 did.\n\nTRAF3 and TRAF6 play a vital role in the RIG-I-mediated signaling pathway293031. Therefore, both molecules are functionally regulated by cellular components to control the immune response and viral proteins to evade the host immune system. These regulatory mechanisms include interfering with the interaction between VISA and TRAF3/6323334, deubiquitinating TRAF3/62632333435, and disrupting the binding of downstream molecules to TRAF3/636373839. Although a recent study has shown that TRAF3 is dispensable for the RNA virus-induced activation of TBK1 and IRF313, our data suggest that TRAF3 is critical for the SeV-elicited production of IFN-\u03b2 in HEK293T cells. We cannot exclude the possibility that the differences in the cell lines and experimental methods we used explains the different conclusions. However, we agree that TRAF6 is a critical component downstream of VISA13.\n\nIn light of our study, RNF166 plays an important role in RNA virus-triggered IFN-\u03b2 production by enhancing the ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6. We noted that expression of a mutant with the RING domain deleted, RNF166-\u2206RING, markedly suppressed VISA-mediated activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter and anti-NDV activity. These data indicate that, as a dominant-negative mutant, RNF166\u2206RING competes with endogenous RNF166 to bind with TRAF3 or TRAF6, so they cannot be efficiently ubiquitinated and blocks VISA signaling. However, STING has no apparent TRAF-binding motifs that are critical for recruiting TRAFs and can directly recruit IRF3 and TBK1 for activation via its carboxyl terminal region40; this may explain why RNF166 does not potentiate the cGAS- and STING-induced activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter.\n\nRNF114 was first identified as a psoriasis-susceptibility gene4142. Later study revealed that overexpressed RNF114 enhances NF-\u039aB and IRF3 reporter activity and increases type I IFN mRNA levels43. However, the analysis of cells with RNF114 knockdown yielded a heterogeneous set of results that may have been due to the presence of different populations within the polyclonal cell lines or a redundant role of RNF11443. Recently, another independent study revealed that RNF114 acts as a negative regulator of NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription by stabilizing the A20 protein and I\u03baB\u03b144. Our data from overexpression and knockdown experiments indicated that RNF114 acts as a negative regulator of SeV-induced IFN-\u03b2 signaling. A20 has been demonstrated to negatively regulate RIG-I-mediated signaling in several independent studies454647, so it is possible that RNF114 depends on A20 to play negative regulatory roles. However, further investigations are needed to confirm the function of RNF114 in the innate immunity signaling pathway.\n\nAlthough RNF114, RNF125, RNF138, and RNF166 have similar domain structures, their functions in SeV-induced signaling are quite diverse, including both positive and negative effects. Future investigations into their structures are expected to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying their different functions in the innate immunity signaling pathway.\n\nMouse antibodies against Flag and HA epitopes (Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich), IRDye800-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals), rabbit polyclonal antibody against TRAF3 (Proteintech), rabbit polyclonal antibody against TRAF6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal antibody against GADPH (Abmart), poly(I:C) (Pharmacia), mouse polyclonal antibody against VISA (Hong-Bing Shu, Wuhan University, China), NDV-enhanced eGFP (Cheng Wang, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China), Human Influenza A virus (Xin Ye, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China), EMCV (Xin Guo, China Agriculture University, Beijing, China), and HT1080 stably-transfected with ISRE luciferase construct (2fTGH) (Zheng-Fan Jiang, Peking University, China) were from the indicated sources. HEK293T, HeLa, and 2fTGH cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Life Technologies) and 100-units/ml penicillin/streptomycin.\n\nMammalian expression plasmids for Flag- or HA-tagged RNF114, RNF125, RNF138, RNF166, and RNF166 truncations were constructed using standard molecular biology techniques. Mammalian expression plasmids for Flag-RIG-I, -MDA5, -VISA, -TRAF3, -TRAF6, -TBK1, -IRF3, HA-ubiquitin, -K48O ubiquitin, -K63O ubiquitin (Lys-48- and Lys-63-only ubiquitin mutants; all lysine residues except Lys-48 and Lys-63 were mutated to arginine), and IFN-\u03b2 promoter luciferase reporter plasmids were provided by Dr. Hong-Bing Shu (Wuhan University, Wuhan, China).\n\nHEK293T cells were seeded onto 24-well dishes and transfected the next day with polyethylenimine (Electron Microscopy Sciences). To normalize for transfection efficiency, 50 ng of pRL-Tk Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid was added to each transfection. About 18 h after transfection, assays were performed using a dual-specific luciferase assay kit (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized based on Renilla luciferase activity. All reporter assays were repeated at least three times.\n\nFor transient transfection and immunoprecipitation experiments, HEK293T cells (2 \u00d7 106) were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 20 h. The transfected cells were lysed in 0.5 ml lysis buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For each immunoprecipitation, a 0.4-ml aliquot of lysate was incubated with 0.5 \u03bcg of the indicated antibody and 25 \u03bcl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 4 h. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with 1 ml lysis buffer. The precipitates were analyzed by western blotting with the indicated antibodies and visualized by incubation with IRDye800-conjugated secondary antibodies using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (Licor Inc.).\n\nCells were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 20 min at \u221220 \u00b0C, rehydrated three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin\u2013PBS for 30 min. The cells were stained with primary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, rinsed in PBS, and stained again with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG or Alexa Fluor 594-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. The cells were then rinsed with PBS containing 4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and mounted. The cells were observed under a confocal microscope (LSM 710 NLO and DuoScan System, Zeiss).\n\nmRNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol reagent (Tiangen Biotech) and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with reverse transcriptase (Fermentas). cDNA was amplified on an ABI7300 Detection System (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Takara) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, and data were normalized by the level of \u03b2-actin in each individual sample. The 2\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method was used to calculate relative expression changes. The gene-specific primers for Q-PCR were: IFN-\u03b2: 5\u2032-AGGACAGGATGAACTTTGAC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGATAGACATTAGCCAGGAG-3\u2032; \u03b2-actin: 5\u2032-ACGTGGACATCCGCAAAGAC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CAAGAAAGGGTGTAACGCAACTA-3\u2032; RNF114: 5\u2032-CGAGAGCACAGAGACTTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-AGGACAGTAAGGACAAGGA-3\u2032; RNF125: 5\u2032-CGTTCCTGTATTGCTACCA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTTCTGACAAGTCCGAATATG-3\u2032; RNF138: 5\u2032-GGAACAGCAATAGGAGTGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTGGTAATCTGGCTAGGATC-3\u2032; RNF166: 5\u2032-AAGGTGACCCTGGCAAAGAT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGGATAGGCTGTGATGTGGG-3\u2032; ISG15: 5\u2032-AGGCAGCGAACTCATCTTTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCAGCATCTTCACCGTCAG-3\u2032; MX1: 5\u2032-GTTTACCAGACTCCGACACGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032- TTCCAGTGCCTTGATTTGCT -3\u2032; P protein of SeV: 5\u2032-TGTTATCGGATTCCTCGACGCAGTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TACTCTCCTCACCTGATCGATTATC-3\u2032.\n\nThe supernatants collected from HEK293T and HeLa cells were added to 2fTGH cells (stably transfected with the ISRE luciferase construct). After 5 h incubation, 2fTGH cells were lysed, and firefly luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega).\n\nPlasmids encoding lentiviruses expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were obtained from the library of the RNAi Consortium (Sigma-Aldrich). shRNF166-#1 (TRCN0000007800), #2 (TRCN0000007801), #3 (TRCN0000007802), #4 (TRCN0000007803), #5 (TRCN0000007804); shRNF114 (TRCN0000004485); shRNF125 (TRCN0000004234); shRNF138-#1 (TRCN0000033835), shRNF138-#2 (TRCN0000033837); shTRAF3 (TRCN0000034222); shTRAF6 (TRCN0000007352); and shVISA (TRCN0000148945) plasmids were purified and then transfected into HEK293T cells with a three-plasmid system to produce lentivirus. HEK293T and HeLa cells were plated onto 6-well plates at ~5 \u00d7 105 cells per well with 2 ml complete medium. One milliliter of the indicated lentivirus was added with 8 \u03bcg/ml polybrene. The plates were incubated for 48 h, and the cells were selected with 2 \u03bcg/ml puromycin. Cells were collected for analysis 72 h after selection.\n\nTRAF3 or TRAF6 knockout in HEK293T cells was generated by the CRISPR/CAS9 system containing pCDNA3.1-Cas9 and gRNA (a gift from Dr. Jian-Zhong Xi, Peking University, China) which has been described48. Five pairs of gRNA to target TRAF3 or TRAF6 were designed and transfected with Cas9 into HEK293T cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the genomic DNAs were extracted for PCR amplification and the indels confirmed by sequencing. The confirmed cell pools were diluted to generate monoclones which were tested by western blot using TRAF3 or TRAF6 antibody to identify gene-knockout cell lines. TRAF3-Cas9 target site: CCAGTTTTTGTCCCTGAACA; TRAF6-Cas9 target site: GTCTGAAAGTGACTGCTGTG. Sequencing primers of TRAF3: 5\u2032-GGATTCTTGTGTTGCCTAA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGGACTTCTTTAGGGCTTT-3\u2032; sequencing primers of TRAF6: 5\u2032-ATTACAACTGAGGTGCTTCT-3\u2032and 5\u2032-GCATCTGGTTCTGTTATAGGA-3\u2032.\n\nTwo-way ANOVA analysis were used to analyze data.
