However, little is known about the molecular mechanism by 149 which colony nutritional conditions lead to changes in behavioral development, susceptibility to 150 pathogens and ultimately, colony survival.\n\n152 In this study, we used pollen-restricted colonies as a model to study the nutritional stress 153 conditions occurring in colonies within intensively cultivated agricultural areas. We used a new 154 technique for colony establishment, which allow us to uncouple the effects of age, behavior and 155 nutrition. We first analyzed the effect of pollen restriction on foraging and brood production and 156 then we used qPCR to analyze the role of pollen restriction on molecular markers of nutrition, 157 immune gene expression and dynamic of viral infection. Finally, we used a multidimensional 158 analysis to show that nutrition has a major role in the dynamics of key genes associated with 159 behavior, nutrition and immunity. This study opens new avenues in the understanding of the 168 Both groups of pollen-restricted (P-R) and pollen-unrestricted (P-UR) bees started foraging when 169 they were 11 days old.

Overall behavioral analyses of these immune genes showed a strong trend 269 toward higher levels in foragers, reaching significant differences in 30 out of 36 comparisons 270 (83.3%). Remarkably, none of the comparisons showed higher expression levels of these genes in 271 nurses than in foragers. On the other hand, nutrition had a significant effect on the expression of 272 immune genes in 12 out 36 comparisons (33.3%). A higher percentage of comparisons showed 273 up-regulation associated with pollen ingestion (22%) than showed up-regulation associated with 274 pollen-restriction (11%). Lastly, age analysis of immune genes revealed significant differences in 275 20 out of 36 comparisons (55.5%). From these comparisons, 70% of them showed age-related 276 increased expression and 30% age-related down-regulation.\n\n278 Gene-specific behavioral analyses revealed that the immune genes exhibiting the highest 279 percentage of comparisons (100%) with higher levels in foragers include the three antimicrobial This article is a US Government work.

Conversely, the pathogen recognition protein pgrp-sc 281 was the immune gene less affected by behavior (50% of the four comparisons). The immune gene 282 most affected by nutrition was the regulatory gene dorsal (75%), while def1 was not affected by 283 nutrition. Dorsal also was the immune gene most influenced by age with a significant effect in 284 100% of the comparisons, followed by abaecin and ppo (75%). In contrast, eater and pgrp-sc 285 were the immune genes less affected by age (25% of the comparisons) (Figure 3 and 4, Table S2 ). Table S2 ). Overall 309 behavioral analysis of these viruses revealed significant differences in 50% of the comparisons.\n\n310 From these comparisons, most of them were upregulated in foragers (83.3%) compared with 311 nurses (16.6%).

Nutritional comparisons revealed higher 317 titers of DWV only in younger nurses from P-UR colonies (P=0.0001), while no significant 318 differences were observed in other comparisons among nutritional, behavioral and age groups.\n\n319 On the other hand, age comparisons showed a tendency toward lower levels in older workers, 320 with significant differences in nurses (P=<0.0001) and foragers (P=0.015) from P-UR colonies 321 ( Figure 5 , Table S2 ).\n\n323 SBV titers showed behavioral differences in 2 out of 4 comparisons. In contrast with DWV, 324 higher levels in foragers were only observed in older workers from P-UR colonies (P=0.0035) 325 and younger nurses had higher titers in P-R colonies (P=0.035). Interestingly, pollen ingestion 326 was associated with higher SBV titers in younger foragers (P=0.011). On the other hand, age 327 comparisons showed higher titers in older foragers from P-R colonies (P=0.034) ( Figure 5 ). 328 329 Behavioral analyses of BQCV only showed significant effects in older workers from P-R 330 colonies, where foragers had higher titers than nurses (P=0.033). In contrast with the other two 331 viruses, younger nurses from P-R colonies had higher titers compared with foragers (P=0.0003).\n\n332 Lastly, in contrast with DWV and SBV, no significant differences were observed in age 333 comparisons ( Figure 5 ).

We find a clear difference in the interactions of 367 immune genes with respect to nursing or foraging associated genes. Thus, the physiological genes 368 associated with nursing showed a strong trend toward negative correlations with immune genes; 369 with vg having 66.66% and 2.77% and mrjp1 72.22% and 0% significant negative and positive 388 between vg and SBV in workers from P-UR colonies in both age groups, the statistical This article is a US Government work.

In contrast, the genes associated with foraging showed in general a 391 positive association with virus levels, with 33.33% of positive correlations and 0% of negative 392 correlations. In particular, ilp2 showed a higher percentage of positive correlations with virus 393 (42.66%), followed by ilp1 (33.33%) and mfe (25%). Virus-specific analyses reveal that both 394 DWV and BQCV exhibit 50% of positive correlations, while SBV does not show significant 395 interactions.

We complemented this 437 experimental model, by using triple TCSC for colony establishment, which allowed us to 438 uncouple the effects of nutrition, behavior and age in colonies of similar size, demography and 439 genetic background. This experimental setup also allowed us to explore the impact of these 440 variables on the expression of physiological genes involved in the nutritionally regulated division 441 of labor, immune genes and three major honey bee viruses. We showed that pollen deprivation 442 leads to a higher rate of new foragers, decreased brood production and caused important changes 443 in the expression of genes associated with physiological activity, immunity and titers of honey 444 bee viruses.

This group of genes include two genes (vg and mrjp1) associated 508 with nursing physiological stage independently of nutritional condition and age, and three genes 509 (mfe, ilp1 and ilp2) whose expression is associated with foraging physiological state when 510 workers are not old or nutritionally stressed. 519 However, our study is the first to investigate the effect of pollen feeding in nurse and foragers at 520 different ages at the colony level. Our finding that nutrition influences vg expression in most 521 nutritional and age groups, with the exception of older foragers, has practical implications for the 522 use of vg as a nutritional biomarker in colony-level field studies. Our expression analysis revealed 523 a trend toward higher expression levels in older nurses irrespectively of nutritional conditions. 524 Although this result was unexpected, a recent study comparing young and old nurses and foragers 525 obtained similar results both measuring mRNA and proteins levels [80] . The biological meaning 526 of this phenomenon it is unknown, however, it is interesting to note that higher levels of Vg are 527 also found in long-lived winter bees [81] . All together, these results reveal a positive association 528 between Vg and longevity, which is compatible with its antioxidant properties [29, 82] .\n\nThis article is a US Government work.

First, we found highly significant 531 differences between nurses and foragers independently of nutritional condition and age. 532 Nurse/forager expression differences were especially large in younger 2-week old workers. This 533 expression pattern unveils mrjp1 as a reliable biomarker of behavior for whole body analyses. 534 Second, young nurses from pollen-restricted colonies had lower mrjp1 levels compared with 535 pollen-unrestricted colonies (P=0.02), but no significant differences between nutritional groups 536 were found in older nurses. Thus, in contrast with vg, the effect of pollen restriction was limited 537 to younger nurses. Third, foragers showed intriguing changes of mrjp1 expression associated with 538 nutrition and age. Younger 2-week-old foragers from colonies with high pollen storages (P-UR), 539 have higher mrjp1 levels compared with foragers from colonies with low pollen storage (P-R). 549 Still, these results suggest interesting possibilities for future studies. Royal jelly proteins secretion 550 from nurses' hypopharyngeal glands has been primarily associated with larval and queen feeding. 551 However, these proteins also are transferred during trophallaxis -mouth to mouth food transfer -552 preferentially to younger workers [86, 87] . Consistently, our results suggest that foragers could be 553 MRJPs donors during trophallactic interactions and that the potential for these interactions 554 increases with nutrition and age. Interestingly, it has been hypothesized that the transfer of royal This article is a US Government work.

Although these studies have revealed the existence of differential tissue-specific 582 responses to nutritional inputs, few tissues and organs have been so far analyzed and it is 583 unknown the contribution of their expression relative to the whole body. Our analysis of ilp1 584 showed that this gene presented behavioral differences in 2-week-old workers from colonies with 585 unrestricted access to pollen, in which foragers had significantly higher levels compared with 586 nurses. Thus, ilp1 expression patterns in the whole-body followed a similar pattern to that 587 reported in isolated brains, but this similarly is restricted to young individuals of colonies not 588 experiencing nutritional stress. The magnitude of the difference between nurses and foragers for 589 the whole body is lower than that observed in brains [29, 30] . This result suggests that in young 590 nurses ilp1 expression is upregulated in other tissues when the colony is not nutritionally stressed. . On the other hand, given the expression differences yet existing between young 595 nurses and foragers from colonies not experiencing pollen deprivation, our results also suggest 596 that under this nutritional condition, ilp1 is predominantly higher expressed in forager's brain 597 compared with other tissues of nurses (e.g., fat body). In addition, nutritional comparison among 598 young foragers indicates that ilp1 expression is reduced by nutritional stress, possibly by 599 inhibiting ilp1 forager's brain expression. In contrast, in older nurses, nutritional stress is 600 associated with increased expression of ilp1. It remains to be addressed the contribution of the 601 brain and other tissues in this response. On the other hand, age comparisons revealed an 602 important age-dependent reduction in its expression in both nutritional conditions. Thus, ilp1 603 follow similar mRNA levels and expression pattern compared to mfe, but with some differences 604 in the strength of the effects of nutrition and age.

On the other hand, similarly, to ilp1, significant 611 differences between nutritional groups were only observed in older workers. This article is a US Government work.

Thus, while the genes associated with nursing 830 showed a strong negative correlation with immune genes, the genes associated with foraging 831 displayed the opposite pattern (Figures 6 and 7 ). An interesting exception was the regulatory 832 immune gene dorsal, which did not show correlations with the genes associated with behavior. 852 DWV and BQCV, and the expression of immune genes, our analysis is unable to distinguish the This article is a US Government work.

Thus, it is either possible that the higher 854 expression of the immune genes observed in foragers can be a response to increased DWV 855 infection, or that this immune expression occurs before the increase in viral infection.

Our main results include 882 the demonstration of higher DWV levels in foragers and unexpectedly, the finding that pollen 883 ingestion is associated with higher DWV in young nurses. Higher DWV in foragers suggests that 884 accelerated behavioral development induced by nutritional stress could lead to amplified forager 885 mortality and further exacerbate changes in colony demography associated with colony collapse.\n\n886 On the other hand, high DWV levels associated with pollen ingestion, suggest that in infected 887 colonies, nutritional resources further enhance the replication of this virus.\n\n888 Our analyses of the correlations among the expression of immune genes and viral titers with 889 physiological genes associated with behavioral state revealed that the immune genes and DWV 890 exhibited strong negative correlations with genes associated with nursing, but positive 891 correlations with genes associated with foraging ( Figure 8 ). These results emphasize the role of 892 nutrition on worker behavioral development and their consequences for honey bee immunity and 893 susceptibility to pathogenic infections. Finally, the results obtained by the NMDS analysis further 894 support the conclusion that behavioral state is the most important factor associated with the 895 expression of immune genes and viral titers. Overall, we provide important insights into the 896 mechanisms by which nutrition, behavior and age alter the expression of key genes involved in 897 the regulation of honey bee physiology and immunity, which are expected to contribute to a 898 better understanding of the effects of nutritional stress on colony health.\n\nThis article is a US Government work.
