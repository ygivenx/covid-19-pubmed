{"title": "First evidence of host range expansion in virophages and its potential impact on giant viruses and host cells", "body": "Host range is defined as the number and nature of hosts in which a virus can multiply 1 . This parameter is predicted to play a determinant role in virus pathogenicity, maintenance in nature and epidemiology 2 . Some viruses have evolved the capacity to expand their host range by biologically adapting to novel hosts. This phenomenon is known as host range expansion and requires the selection of specific mutations that enable a given viral species to replicate in a novel host 3 . In bacteriophages, such host range mutations target mostly the genes encoding the viral tail and baseplate involved in attachment to a receptor at the host cell surface 4, 5 .\n\nVirophages are double-stranded (ds) DNA viruses that combine features of both satellite viruses and autonomous bona fide viruses. On the one hand, virophages replicate only in the presence of an associated giant virus coinfecting their host cell 6, 7 . This behavior is similar to the dependence of satellite viruses on their helper virus 8 . On the other hand, the level of complexity of the capsids and genomes of virophages make them closer to autonomous viruses, such as adenoviruses, than to satellite viruses 9, 10 .\n\nStudying the mechanism of host range in virophages is interesting because their replication requires the presence of two types of hosts, a giant virus and a cellular host of this giant virus (a protist). Sputnik, the first virophage to be isolated, was described in 2008 6 .\n\nSputnik is able to infect mimiviruses of the three phylogenetic lineages (A, B and C) whose members replicate in Acanthamoeba spp. 6, 11 . In contrast, another virophage named Zamilon was found to exhibit a narrower host range, being able to replicate with mimiviruses from lineages B and C but not with those belonging to lineage A 12 . The resistance of lineage A mimiviruses to Zamilon has been linked to the presence of a defense system 13 , named MIMIVIRE, which is composed of a helicase, a nuclease and the product of a gene containing 4 repeats identical to fragments of the Zamilon genome (called Target Repeat-Containing genetrcg). Trcg has been proposed to serve as a guide to target a given genetic element for author/funder. All rights reserved.

Although the MIMIVIRE mechanism of action is still controversial 14 , the host range of Zamilon has been efficiently expanded to mimiviruses of lineage A by silencing the MIMIVIRE genes 13 and, more recently, by knocking out the putative canonical gene of the system using homologous recombination 15 . The MIMIVIRE system has also been successfully tested in bacteria, restoring susceptibility to antibiotics through the transformation of bacteria with plasmids containing trcg targeting antibioticresistance genes 16 . Nevertheless, host range expansion mediated by spontaneous mutations has never been described in virophages. Moreover, to date, Sputnik, Zamilon and other virophages were almost exclusively challenged with mimiviruses from the three lineages, A-C, but not with distant mimivirus relatives. The only virophage tested with a distant mimivirus was Mavirus. Mavirus replicates only in the marine flagellate Cafeteria roenbergensis coinfected with a distant mimivirus named CroV 17 . Moreover, once this virus begins to replicate, it has been shown that Mavirus acts as an agent of adaptive immunity that protects its host cells from CroV infection 18, 19 .\n\nIn this study, two recently isolated distant mimiviruses, known as Tupanvirus Deep Ocean and Tupanvirus Soda Lake, were challenged with virophages [20] [21] [22] . We report a preliminary identification of the first mechanism of host range expansion in virophages. We were able to characterize the genetic component involved in this process. We then conducted a comprehensive study to investigate the ecological impact of virophage host range expansion through its effect on the novel virus host as well as on the host cell population. The involvement of the mutation in host range expansion of the virophage is discussed.\n\nFirst evidence of host range expansion in virophage author/funder. All rights reserved.

Three virophages characterized in earlier studies were assayed with these giant viruses, including Guarani, Sputnik and Zamilon virophages 6, 12, 24 Soda Lake ( Fig. 1a and 1b) . Unexpectedly, it was not possible to detect Guarani replication with Tupanvirus Deep Ocean or Tupanvirus Soda Lake ( Fig. 1a and 1b) .\n\nAfter the lysis of host cells coinfected with Guarani and Tupanvirus Deep Ocean or Tupanvirus Soda Lake, each culture supernatant was filtered through 0.22-\u00b5m-pore filters to remove giant virus particles. The obtained supernatants containing only Guarani particles were subsequently used to infect fresh A. castellanii cells simultaneously inoculated with Tupanvirus Deep Ocean or Tupanvirus Soda Lake. The replication of the virophage was then measured by qPCR. In these assays, Guarani remarkably infected and successfully replicated with both Tupanvirus Deep Ocean and Tupanvirus Soda Lake after only one passage with each virus (Fig. 2a and 2b) . We interpreted this phenomenon as the result of a mechanism of host range expansion that allowed Guarani to replicate with new viral hosts previously resistant to this virophage. A small fraction of the Guarani population in our stocks was likely composed of an emergent mutant able to infect Tupanvirus. We found that Guarani isolated author/funder. All rights reserved.

Taken together, these results present the first evidence of a host range expansion in the virophage.\n\nWe then analyzed whether host acquisition of Guarani was associated with a fitness trade-off with the prototype isolate of genus Mimivirus, Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APMV), which has been used beforehand to propagate the wild-type genotype of Guarani 24, 25 . Indeed, experimental evolution studies for other viruses have shown that increasing the virus fitness in one host could result in a fitness penalty in another host 1 . We compared the replication efficiency of Guarani before and after its passages with each Tupanvirus strain using APMV as a giant virus host. Figure 2c shows that even after the acquisition of new virus hosts, the virophage maintained its capacity to replicate with APMV.\n\nIn addition, the replication efficiency of Guarani isolated from Tupanvirus Deep Ocean and Tupanvirus Soda Lake supernatants with APMV was similar to that of the original strain of Guarani propagated with APMV (Student's t-test, p> 0.66 and p >0.69, respectively). Similar results were obtained with Moumouvirus and Megavirus Courdo 11, which are mimiviruses from lineages B and C, respectively 26, 27 (Fig. 2c ).\n\nIn bacteriophages, host range expansion involves several molecular paths. Indeed, spontaneous or induced mutations in the long tail fiber gene have enabled some phages to infect new bacterial hosts [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . To identify the genetic features responsible for the expanded host range of Guarani, we sequenced the genome of this virophage obtained before and after the passage with each Tupanvirus. The Guarani genome consists of a circular dsDNA genome of 18,967 base pairs encoding 22 predicted genes very similar to Sputnik 24 . We found that the virophage isolated from APMV supernatant has no mutations in its genome compared to the original strain that we sequenced previously 24 . We therefore consider this strain to be the author/funder. All rights reserved.

Interestingly, genome analysis of Guarani isolated from Tupanvirus supernatant revealed the emergence of a new subpopulation of the virophage that shows a deletion in its genome. This deletion consists of a loss of an 81 nucleotide-long sequence located in ORF 8 that encodes a collagen-like protein ( Supplementary Fig. 1 , Table   S1 ). The deletion has been detected in Guarani purified from both Tupanvirus Deep Ocean and Tupanvirus Soda Lake. We then aimed to confirm the results of the sequencing experiment by designing a PCR system that targets the deletion site, as shown in Figure 3a .\n\nWe were able to confirm the presence of two genotypes of Guarani isolated from Tupanvirus supernatant versus only one genotype in APMV supernatant (Fig. 3b ). The band corresponding to each genotype detected in the Tupanvirus supernatant was recovered from the 2% agarose gel. Sanger sequencing was then performed on each band and confirmed that the deletion-mutation of the 81-nucleotide-long stretch is localized in ORF 8 of the mutant virophage. The same procedure was performed with Guarani cultivated with APMV and confirmed the presence of the wild-type genotype, but the mutant was not detected in this condition.\n\nVirus adaptation to new hosts combines two steps: first, the introduction of mutations required to allow the virus to infect new hosts and then its ability to maintain the mutations during spread within the host population 33 . With this in mind, we investigated the capacity of Guarani to maintain the deletion during passage experiments using Tupanvirus Deep Ocean as a virus host. This Tupanvirus strain was selected because it enables the virophage to replicate with higher replication efficiency ( Fig. 2a and 2b) . We continuously cocultured the mutant genotype 5 times in A. castellanii and subsequently characterized its progeny after each passage using our PCR system targeting the deletion site (Fig. 4a) . The same procedure was carried out for APMV and Guarani wild-type (control) (Fig. 4b) . Passages with Tupanvirus author/funder. All rights reserved.

Such a decrease was not observed in the control (Fig. 4b) . These results are intriguing given the high replication efficiency of the mutant genotype observed with Tupanvirus Deep Ocean (Fig. 2a) . At the same time, we noticed a progressive increase in the host cell population survival over the passages (data not shown). This probably raises questions regarding the virulence of the mutant genotype toward its new virus host, Tupanvirus. Indeed, it is known from our previous study that Guarani impaired the infectivity of its viral host APMV, resulting in a decrease in amoebae lysis 24 . Nevertheless, as this is the first time that we describe a host range expanding mutation in virophage, we expected the mutant genotype to have a distinct virulent profile toward its novel virus host than the wild-type strain toward APMV. To test this hypothesis, we first started by studying the evolution of Tupanvirus infectious particle production during a passage experiment in the presence of mutant Guarani. Figure 4c shows Tupanvirus titers during a ten-passage experiment in the presence of the virophage measured by end-point dilution method. Prior to end point dilution, the virus supernatant was submitted to heat treatment at 55\u00b0C for 30 min 34 . This treatment efficiently inactivated the mutant virophage without reducing the titer of viable virus particles ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). We found that infection with the mutant strain severely modifies the trajectory of Tupanvirus in the model.\n\nWhile the virus was found to increasing its titer over passages in the absence of the virophage, the presence of the latter caused a drastic decrease in virus propagation (Fig. 4c) . Moreover, at the ninth passage, we were intrigued by the absence of cell lysis and any evident cytopathic effect on the host population. This observation probably indicates that the mutation not only enabled Guarani to replicate with Tupanvirus but also increased its virulence to the point of inducing the elimination of the giant virus in the model. author/funder.

The Guarani used in this study was isolated and then purified from the second passage with Tupanvirus in which the mutation was detected.\n\nWe first quantified the impact of virophage on genome replication of Tupanvirus at 48 h p.i. Figure 5a shows that mutant Guarani decreases the replication of Tupanvirus DNA by approximately 3-fold. This low inhibition rate appears relatively similar to what has been found between the wild-type strain and APMV 24 . Experimental studies supported by bioinformatic analyses have shown that in contrast to their virus hosts, virophages become active during a late phase of giant virus infection 17, 24, 35 . Since genome replication is an early step in the cycle of giant viruses, this property may allow them to anticipate virophage parasitism and produce some genomic copies. We then tested the effect on the production of viable particles by quantifying the titer of Tupanvirus from 0 h to 72 h p.i. Our results reveal that mutant Guarani induces a severe decrease in the production of Tupanvirus virions during the virus cycle (Fig. 5b) . We found that in the absence of virophage, the virus was able to increase its titer by up to 500-fold during a one-step growth curve in amoebae. In contrast, infection with the mutant genotype prevented any increase in the virus titer. This inhibition is significantly far higher than that of the wild-type toward APMV 24 , but at 48 h p.i., we still were able to detect the production of infectious virions by end point dilution.\n\nTo gain more insight into the virophage-giant virus interaction, amoebas were coinfected with Tupanvirus Deep Ocean and mutant Guarani at MOIs of 10 and prepared for transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Remarkably, TEM images revealed that infection with mutant Guarani induces a total inhibition of Tupanvirus particle morphogenesis ( Fig. 5c author/funder. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/780841 doi: bioRxiv preprint 5h). We scanned more than two hundred cells and quantified the number of amoebas, in which both virophage and giant virus progeny were observed ( Fig. 5c-5d ). Our results confirmed the absence of any simultaneous occurrence of Guarani and Tupanvirus virion production in all coinfected cells. The presence of the virophage was automatically associated with the absence of Tupanvirus virions ( Fig. 5e-5h ). To characterize this phenomenon, we observed virus factories infected with the mutant virophage at serial stages of coinfection ( Fig. 6 ). Figure 6a shows that at 16 h p.i., the virus was able to produce mature virus factories, even in the presence of virophage. The first virophage progeny was observed at this step.\n\nLater in the cycle, the replication of the virophage increased progressively and caused remarkable damage to virus factories ( Fig. 6b-6e ). The latter appeared disintegrated, and virophage progeny were actively emerging from each of their pieces. Virophage multiplication was clearly correlated with a progressive degradation of Tupanvirus viral factories. Isolation and characterization of these structures have previously shown that they are composed of an arsenal of virus-encoded proteins involved in virus replication and assembly 36 . Therefore, there is some overlap between our observations and previous studies reporting that virophages hijack their giant virus-encoded machinery to express and probably replicate their genomes 35, 37 . In this study, we clearly observed that these small viruses obtain essential elements from the factories of their host viruses to propagate.\n\nHowever, it is still not clear how the virus was able to produce infectious virions at the end of its cycle (Fig. 5b) , despite the presence of the virophage that is supposed to induce its elimination. We therefore quantified the rate of infected cells for each virus (Tupanvirus and Guarani). We found that all observed cells were successfully infected with Tupanvirus (100%). Although no virions have been produced, the presence of their volcanic-like virus factory in the cytoplasm of a given host cell was considered a sign of infection with the virus.\n\nOn the other hand, virophage virions were observed in approximately 76% of host cells (152 author/funder.

This finding means that up to 24% of amoebas were successfully infected only by Tupanvirus alone without the virophage. Two plausible explanations could justify this observation. First, the virophage suspension used here contained both mutant and wild-type genotypes; thus, the latter was not able to replicate in cells it infected. Second, the titration of virophage was carried out using qPCR which, in contrast to end-point dilution, targets both infectious and defective particles. Based on these results, we speculate that giant virus particles produced during coinfection experiments with \n\nTupanvirus is one of the most complex viruses isolated to date 22 . In addition to the distinct genetic and structural characteristics of this virus, it exhibits a remarkable biological feature never previously observed in other giant viruses. Tupanvirus is able to trigger a cytotoxic profile associated with a shutdown of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in host and nonhost organisms 20 . This profile seems to be independent of virus replication and probably allows the virus to modulate nonhost predator organisms to increase viral survival chances in nature. In host organisms, such as A. castellanii, this phenomenon is mainly observed at high MOIs (MOI= 100) 20 . In this study, we investigated how this cytotoxicity could modulate virophage parasitism and notably infection by the mutant genotype of Guarani. To the best of our author/funder.

A. castellanii cells were coinfected with Tupanvirus at an MOI of 100 and each virophage (Sputnik, Zamilon or mutant Guarani) at MOIs of 10. Moumouvirus, a lineage B mimivirus, was used as a control because it allows the replication of all virophages used in this study. First, at 9 h p.i., 5x10 5 cells were collected to check the impact of Guarani on ribosomal shutdown. We found that in contrast to the controls, irrespective of mutant Guarani infection, Tupanvirus was able to induce a severe shutdown in host ribosomal RNA abundance (Fig. 9a) . We then measured the replication of each virophage by qPCR and calculated their DNA amount increase using the delta Ct method considering times 0 and 48 p.i. All virophages were able to replicate with Moumouvirus at the MOI of 100 (Fig. 9b) . In contrast, all of the virophages, including Guarani, failed to infect Tupanvirus at high MOI (Fig. 9c) . These results suggest that the cytotoxic profile of Tupanvirus allowed it to escape virophage infection and, notably, the eradication that could be caused by Guarani.\n\nEvolution is an inevitable path for living organisms to adapt to changes in their ecosystem and to explore new environmental niches. In microorganisms, the evolutionary process has been studied in considerable detail. The process seems to be driven by two major factors: genome plasticity and selection 40 . Because of their fast replication and large population sizes, viruses offer an experimental advantage to study the evolutionary process at the laboratory 41 . Although much is known about the process of evolution in bacteriophages and many emerging zoonotic viruses and how they adapt to new hosts, this mechanism is still unclear for virophages and satellite viruses.\n\nIn this study, we report the first description of a host range expansion in virophages.\n\nWe demonstrated that the Guarani virophage was able to spontaneously expand its host range to infect two novel giant viruses from the genus Tupanvirus that were initially resistant to this author/funder.

Host acquisition was associated with the emergence of a new genotype of Guarani that showed deletion of an 81-nucleotide long sequence from ORF8 that encodes a collagen repeat-containing protein. We found that despite this deletion, the virophage was still able to replicate with its previous virus hosts without any fitness change (Fig. 3c) . One might suppose that this replication has been observed because of the presence of a background of wild-type virophage. However, almost pure mutant Guarani (isolated from passage 5 with Tupanvirus as shown in Fig. 4a) Therefore, it is possible that the mutant genotype was already present in the Guarani population that seemed not able to replicate with Tupanvirus. However, its concentration was probably under the limit of detection of our systems. Then, Tupanvirus allowed the selection of the mutant in coinfected cells. The presence of a very low amount of the mutant virophage after the first passage with Tupanvirus probably supports this hypothesis (Fig. 4a, arrow) .\n\nThis finding also suggests that the virophage has replicated even in the primo coinfection with Tupanvirus at levels too low to be detected by real-time PCR but high enough to expand the virophage population, enabling its multiplication in subcultures. author/funder.

In all these viruses, the deletion concerned sequences of several kilobase pairs (kbp) in length located around each end of the virus genomes. The ends of the genomes of these viruses seem to be highly recombinogenic in contrast to the central region, which is more subjected to selective pressures because it contains conserved core genes 43 . For ASFV, the deletion was associated with an enhancement in the capacity of the virus to replicate in Vero cells 45 . For Mimivirus, the loss of genes affected genes encoding fibers and ankyrin repeat-containing proteins. This genetic variation has given rise to a new subpopulation of viruses lacking surface fibers that were resistant to virophage 43 . Spontaneous in-frame deletions have also been reported for several other viruses, including influenza virus, photosynthetic cyanophages and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).\n\nDepending on the affected genes, these mutations could have a beneficial or deleterious impact on the viral fitness [47] [48] [49] .\n\nIn our case, the deletion affected a part of a gene. ORF 8 in Guarani is 933 base pairs in length and contains 310 amino acids 24 . The same gene was described in all Sputnik strains (with 100% amino acid identity) and was predicted to be involved in protein-protein interactions with giant viruses within factories 6, 11 . This gene shows a remarkable repetitive pattern. Five repeats of 27 nucleotides could be detected. The deletion affects 4 repeats, of which 2 repeats are completely lost (Fig. 3a ). Our PCR system targeting the deletion site confirmed the presence of a new subpopulation in Sputnik that shows the same deletion as Guarani even before contact with Tupanvirus. This finding probably explains the capacity of Sputnik to replicate with this virus in primo coculture (Supplementary Fig. 4) .\n\nAlthough it is difficult to predict the exact function that this gene could play during virophage infection, one plausible scenario is that ORF8 is implicated in the recognition and author/funder.

Indeed, collagen-like motifs play a potential role in the attachment of phages to target bacteria. These motifs have been described in tail fiber proteins of several bacteriophages, and it is known from previous studies that mutations in this region are a crucial step in determining the acquisition of new hosts for these viruses 50, 51 . On the other hand, collagen-like repeats have also been suggested to represent recombination hotspots for bacteriophages 50 . Interestingly, a spontaneous deletion of a region containing a collagen-like repeat has been described for the temperate Streptococcus thermophilus phage phi SFi21 after serial passage in bacteria. The mutant phage was remarkably unable to lysogenize its host cells 52 . It is tempting to link these observations to the study of Desnues et al 53 . The authors found that in Sputnik 2, the collagenlike gene also plays a role in recombination spot that allows the virophage to integrate itself into the Lentillevirus genome as provirophage. Therefore, the deletion in ORF8 could also involve a process of integrating Guarani into the genome of Tupanvirus that could allow the virophage to replicate. However, an experimental setting to confirm such a hypothesis is challenging and is not currently possible to set up. However, these data allow us to propose that the collagen-like gene contributes to the flexible gene content of virophages, giving them an advantage in their host-parasite interaction with giant viruses.\n\nThe second major finding of our study is that adapted virophage has not only acquired the capacity to replicate with Tupanvirus but has become highly virulent enough to induce the elimination of its novel associated virus. This observation reminds what has been described for the S. thermophilus phage phi Sfi21, for which a spontaneous deletion of a collagen-like repeat containing-region has transformed this temperate phage to a pure lytic phage 52 . We observed in this study that mutant Guarani did not severely affect Tupanvirus genome replication, but it seems to abolish its morphogenesis as no virions have been observed in coinfected cells. The virophage showed a clear selective inhibition toward Tupanvirus. author/funder. All rights reserved.

Otherwise, apart from Guarani, the only known virulent acanthamoeba virophage is Sputnik. However, Sputnik could probably not be considered as an appropriate control because a subpopulation carrying the same mutation (as Guarani) was detected in this virophage.\n\nWe demonstrated here that mutant Guarani confers total protection to neighboring 18 . The main advantage of integrating virophages is probably that the host cell carries a permanent antiviral weapon in its genome. However, random integration of foreign genetic elements might have considerable impacts on the cell. These repercussions might range from altering its survival to affecting its evolutionary course 54 . In this context, infection with highly virulent virophages, such as mutant Guarani, may be more advantageous for amoebae than integration of Mavirus for C. roenbergensis. However, the fate of the virophage is also different between these two varieties of tripartite interactions. While the Mavirus genome is efficiently preserved within the C. roenbergensis genome, extinction of their associated giant virus will most likely cause the extinction of highly virulent author/funder.

The Guarani used here was isolated from the second passage with Tupanvirus where the mutation was detected. The serial passaging experiment was performed as described above. After each passage, the titer of infectious particles was quantified by end point dilution.\n\nTo study the effect of mutant Guarani on the DNA replication and virion production of To perform the dose-response to virophage, the same procedure was repeated using different MOIs of the giant virus (Tupanvirus or APMV) and the virophage (Guarani or Zamilon). The supernatant was then collected for end point dilution after complete lysis of cells or 5 days p.i.\n\nin the absence of cell lysis.\n\nVirus titration was performed as previously described 24 . To inhibit the virophage and avoid interference with giant virus multiplication during the end point dilution method, each virus supernatant was heated for 30 min at 55\u00b0C. This treatment allowed us to inactivate the virophage without a significant decrease in the virus titer.\n\nauthor/funder. All rights reserved.
