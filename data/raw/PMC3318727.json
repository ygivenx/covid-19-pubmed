{"title": "Phosphatidylinositol 4-Kinase III\u03b2 Is Required for Severe\nAcute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Spike-mediated Cell Entry*", "body": "Phosphoinositide (PI)3 lipids play\ncrucial roles in membrane trafficking. PIs can be tightly regulated both spatially\nand temporally by the many PI kinases and phosphatases that are distributed\nthroughout the different intracellular compartments (1). The potential roles for PIs and PI kinases in the life cycle of\nviruses have been studied extensively. For example, PI3Ks appear to play a\npredominant role in regulating Ebola virus entry (2). Several other viruses also activate PI3K during infection, such as\nVSV and influenza virus (3, 4). In addition, several groups identified PI4KA\nas a cofactor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication (5\u20137). The HCV\nnonstructural protein NS5A was demonstrated to interact with PI4KA and stimulate its\nkinase activity (8, 9). Recently, PI4KB was shown to be a key cellular protein\nexploited by several plus-strand RNA viruses for replication, and the PI4P-rich\nlipid microenvironment is essential for enteroviral RNA replication (10).\n\nIn April 2003, a novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified as\nthe etiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (11). SARS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-strand\nRNA virus. Angiotensin-1-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is the functional receptor of\nSARS-CoV, which is responsible for mediating SARS-CoV entry into host cells (12, 13).\nUnderstanding the molecular basis by which SARS-CoV targets cells has been critical\nto unraveling the mechanisms of its pathogenesis. SARS-CoV enters cells by direct\nfusion at the plasma membrane (14\u201316). Further studies\nprimarily using pseudotyped virus systems have shown that SARS-CoV entry is\npH-dependent and have suggested that the endosome protease cathepsin L may be\ninvolved in entry (17\u201319). Apart from these observations, no other\nkey cellular factors have been shown to be specifically involved in the SARS-CoV\nlife cycle.\n\nIn this study, we reveal the role of PI4KB in SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. This is the\nfirst study to demonstrate that PI4KB is required for cell entry mediated by\nSARS-CoV S and that its function is dependent upon its kinase activity.\nInterestingly, we found that PI4P, the product of PI4KB catalysis, creates a lipid\nmicroenvironment that is required for SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. Our results provide\nimportant insights into the life cycle of SARS-CoV and suggest that PI4KB may be a\npotential therapeutic target in the near future.\n\nVeroE6 cells (African green monkey kidney cell line) and HEK293T cells\n(human embryonic kidney cell line) from the American Type Culture\nCollection were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)\nsupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin,\nand 100 units/ml streptomycin at 37 \u00b0C with 5%\nCO2.\n\nAnti-PI4KB polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Millipore (Billerica,\nMA). Anti-\u03b2-actin monoclonal antibodies, anti-FLAG antibodies,\nand anti-human Fc antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Anti-ACE2\npolyclonal antibodies were purchased from R&D Systems\n(Minneapolis, MN). Anti-GFP antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-PI4P mouse monoclonal antibodies\nwere obtained from Echelon Biosciences (Salt Lake City, UT). LY294002,\nwortmannin, DMSO, Hoechst 33342, TPCK-trypsin, and proteinase K were\npurchased from Sigma.\n\nPseudoviruses were produced as described previously (20). Briefly, HEK293T cells were\nco-transfected with pQCXIX vector, a spike-encoding plasmid (Sh-2,\nprovided by Dr. Michael Farzan) or a control plasmid (VSV-G) and a\ngag/pol expression plasmid. The enhanced GFP gene was inserted into the\npQCXIX vector. At 48 h post-transfection, virus supernatants were\nharvested and filtered through a 0.45-\u03bcm filter. If required,\nvirions were concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 40,000 \u00d7\ng in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 2 h at\n4 \u00b0C. The pellets were resuspended in DMEM and stored at\n\u221280 \u00b0C. Viral titers were determined as described\npreviously (21).\n\nVeroE6 cells were treated with the indicated concentration of LY294002 or\nDMSO for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Next, the cells were incubated with\npseudovirus for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C in the presence of drug before\nfresh medium was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C\nfor 48 h. Then the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at\nroom temperature (RT) for 20 min. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst\n33342 diluted in PBS for 10 min at RT. Images were captured using a\nNikon Eclipse TE2000-U inverted fluorescence microscope and analyzed\nwith Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics).\n\nAll siRNAs used in this study were obtained from Ribobio, Guanzhou,\nChina. For transfection, VeroE6 cells were seeded at 5 \u00d7\n104 cells/well in 24-well plates. The following day, the\ncells were transfected with 1 \u03bcl of Lipofectamine RNAiMax\nreagent (Invitrogen) at 50 nm siRNA in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen).\nAfter 24 h, the cells were trypsinized and seeded into a 96-well plate.\nAt 48 h post-siRNA transfection, the experimental virus infections were\nperformed.\n\nProtein samples were separated on 4\u201320% SDS-polyacrylamide gels\nand transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were probed with\nprimary antibodies. The proteins were visualized by HRP-conjugated\nsecondary antibodies and a chemiluminescent substrate (Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology) and exposed to film.\n\nVeroE6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 1 \u00d7\n105/ml. DMSO or LY294002 diluted in DMEM was added to the\ncells the following day. After a 3-h incubation at 37 \u00b0C and 5%\nCO2, the cell culture medium was removed, and new DMEM\nwas added to the cells. Each experimental group included triplicate\nwells. Then 20 \u03bcl of CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution cell\nproliferation assay buffer (Promega) was added to each well, and the\ncultures were incubated for an additional 2 h. Absorbance was recorded\nat 490 nm. For siRNA treatment, cell viability was determined 48 h after\nsiRNA transfection.\n\nTotal RNA was harvested from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) for\nanalysis of host gene expression. Cellular RNAs were reverse-transcribed\nand amplified by PCR using the SuperScriptTM III Platinum\nOne-Step quantitative RT-PCR system with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) and\nTaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems). Cellular RNAs were\nnormalized to GAPDH levels. Data were analyzed relative to\nsiControl-treated cells. All assays were performed on an ABI 7500 system\nand analyzed with SDS 1.3 (Applied Biosystems).\n\nAt 48 h post-transfection of siRNAs, VeroE6 cells were trypsinized and\ncollected in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. Then the cultures were incubated\nwith ACE2 antibodies for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. After three washes in\nPBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled secondary\nantibodies. After fixation in 0.5% paraformaldehyde, the samples were\nanalyzed on a Beckman Coulter EPICS Elite ESP instrument.\n\nCells grown on glass coverslips were rinsed with PBS and fixed in 4%\nparaformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at RT followed by quenching in 50\nmm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min at RT. Then the cells\nwere blocked and permeabilized in 0.2% saponin, 10% FBS in PBS for 1 h\nat RT. The cells were incubated with primary antibody against PI4P in\nblocking buffer at 4 \u00b0C overnight followed by three 5-min washes\nin PBS. Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were used\nat a dilution of 1:500 in blocking buffer. After three washes with PBS,\nthe cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) in PBS for 10\nmin at RT. For FLAG-Sac1 immunostaining, after PI4P immunostaining, the\ncells were incubated with anti-FLAG primary antibodies in blocking\nbuffer for 1 h at RT followed by three 5-min washes with PBS. Alexa\n568-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) were used at a dilution\nof 1:500 in blocking buffer. Images were captured using confocal\nlaser-scanning microscopy (Leica TCS SP2) and analyzed with Leica\nconfocal software.\n\nThe SARS-CoV RBR (S318\u2013510) was expressed as a chimeric protein\nwith human IgG-Fc, and proteins were expressed in 293T cells. The\nrecombinant proteins were purified on protein G-agarose beads (GE\nHealthcare). Virus, S318\u2013510Fc, or Fc proteins were bound to\ncells at the indicated concentrations at 4 \u00b0C. After 2 h,\nunbound virus or protein was removed by washing. The cells were either\nlysed to measure bound virus or protein or were incubated at 37\n\u00b0C for 2 h to allow for internalization and treated with 1 mg/ml\nproteinase K prior to lysis to remove uninternalized virus. For\nneutralization experiments, SARS pseudovirus was preincubated with\nanti-SARS spike-neutralizing antibodies (50 \u03bcg/ml) or with an\nirrelevant isotype-matched control antibody (anti-CD81) for 1 h at RT.\nThen SARS pseudovirus was added to VeroE6 cells for virus binding or\ninternalization assays.\n\nVeroE6 cells were transfected at 50\u201370% confluence with a\nFLAG-Sac1 expression vector or empty vector (pCDNA3.1). Transfections\nwere performed with X-tremeGENE HP reagents following the manufacturer's\ninstructions (Roche Applied Science). Virus infection experiments were\nperformed at 48 h post-transfection.\n\nVeroE6 cells were preincubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min with DMEM in\nthe presence or absence of LY294002 (30 \u03bcm). Then the\ncells were spin-infected with pseudovirus at 2000 \u00d7\ng for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. The medium was\nchanged, and the cells were incubated with 5 \u03bcg/ml TPCK-trypsin\nor with PBS alone at 37 \u00b0C for 13 min. The trypsin was removed,\nand DMEM with or without LY294002 (30 \u03bcm) was added.\nAfter 2 h, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% FBS.\nThe cells were analyzed for GFP expression after 48 h.\n\nThe cells were seeded in duplicate six-well plates, one for lipid\nextractions and one for cell counting on a hemocytometer. Equivalent\nnumbers of cells (4 million) were collected, and PI4P was extracted\naccording to a detailed protocol from a PI4P mass strips kit (Echelon\nBiosciences). Lipids were spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes\npre-spotted with PI standards and visualized with the PI4P-specific\ndetectors and chemiluminescent reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).\n\nAll data shown are the means \u00b1 S.E., and statistical analyses\nwere performed using Student's t test.\n\nTo assess the efficiency of virus entry, we produced GFP-containing\npseudovirus with SARS-CoV envelope glycoproteins (spike) and VSV-G\nprotein (VSVP), with infected cells fluorescing green during microscopy.\nWe first screened several chemicals known to be kinase inhibitors to\ndetermine their effects on SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. We found that\nLY294002 (PI kinase inhibitor) significantly inhibited the entry of SARS\npseudovirions into VeroE6 cells, whereas entry of VSV-G pseudovirus was\nnot affected (Fig.\n1A). A cell viability assay demonstrated\nthat LY294002 had no significant effect on VeroE6 growth during the\nexperiments (Fig.\n1B). LY294002 inhibited entry in a\ndose-dependent manner (Fig.\n1C). LY294002 treatment at 30\n\u03bcm strongly inhibited SARS-CoV S-mediated entry by\nmore than 50%. In addition, we observed similar results using Western\nblot analysis to quantify GFP expression to detect virus entry (Fig. 1D). Another PI\nkinase inhibitor, wortmannin, also inhibited SARS-CoV S-mediated entry\ninto VeroE6 cells with no effect on VSV-G pseudovirus entry (Fig. 1E). We found\nthat entry of SARS pseudovirions into VeroE6 cells was inhibited by\nwortmannin with an IC50 of 80 nm (Fig. 1F), which was\nconsistent with the results reported for type III PI4Ks (PI4KA and\nPI4KB) (22, 23). Wortmannin treatment at 10 nm, a\nconcentration that efficiently inhibits PI 3-kinases, had no significant\neffect on SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. There was no significant\ncytotoxicity with wortmannin treatment at concentrations up to 1\n\u03bcm (Fig.\n1B). Finally, total GFP expression after\nSARS-CoV S-mediated entry also decreased when the cells were pretreated\nwith wortmannin (Fig.\n1G).\n\nLY294002 and wortmannin are PI kinase inhibitors that target several PI\nkinases, such as PI3Ks and type III PI4Ks (PI4KA and PI4KB) (23). To our knowledge, the\nfunctions of PI4Ks in mammalian cells have not been well defined. In\nthis study, we sought to identify the type of PI kinase that was\naffected by LY294002 and wortmannin. Given that p85\u03b1 is the\nmajor and most important subunit among the PI3K subunits (24), this subunit was assessed in\nthe following experiments. We designed a series of corresponding siRNAs\nto test the effect of knocking down each individual gene on virus entry\nwithout significant effects on cell viability (Table 1). Quantitative RT-PCR results demonstrated\nthat the siRNAs we used efficiently inhibited target gene expression\n(PI3KR1, PI4KA, and PI4KB), whereas the control siRNA had little effect\n(Fig. 2A).\nFluorescence microscopy showed a significant inhibition of SARS-CoV\nS-mediated entry only after PI4KB siRNA transfection compared with\ncontrol siRNA-treated cells, whereas the PI4KA knockdown had no\nsignificant effect on SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. Conversely, SARS-CoV\nS-mediated entry increased after transfection of PI3KR1 (p85\u03b1)\nsiRNA into VeroE6 cells (Fig.\n2B). In contrast, PI kinase siRNAs had no\neffect on VSV-G entry into VeroE6 cells (Fig. 2B). Statistical analysis demonstrated\nthe significance of the above observation (Fig. 2C). PI4KB silencing by three\nindividual siRNA duplexes strongly inhibited SARS-CoV S-mediated entry,\nas confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2D). Moreover, siRNA duplex 2 was the\nmost potent for both PI4KB transcript silencing and for the inhibition\nof SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. From these results, we conclude that\nLY294002 and wortmannin inhibit SARS pseudovirus entry by targeting\nPI4KB and that PI4KB is involved in SARS-CoV S-mediated entry into\nVeroE6 cells.\n\nInterestingly, the opposing roles of PI3KR1 and PI4KB during SARS-CoV\nS-mediated entry into VeroE6 cells suggest that their different roles in\nthis process may be linked to their specific kinase activities. Previous\nstudies have established that PI4KB is responsible for the production of\nmost of the PI4P present in cells (25), whereas PI3K can convert PI4P into phosphatidylinositol\n3,4-bisphosphate, thereby decreasing PI4P concentrations (26). These previous results suggest\nthat the level of PI4P may be the main reason that PI3KR1 and PI4KB\ndemonstrate different functions in SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. To\ninvestigate whether kinase activity could account for the different\neffects of the PI kinases on SARS-CoV S-mediated entry and to test\nwhether PI4P lipids directly regulate viral entry independent of PI4KB,\nVeroE6 cells were transiently transfected with the SAC1\ngene, a PI phosphatase that specifically converts PI4P lipids back to PI\n(27). This phosphatase has\nbeen shown to oppose PI4KB in vivo. As demonstrated by\nthe virus entry assay (Fig. 3,\nA and B), SARS-CoV S-mediated\nentry was reduced by \u223c80% in VeroE6 cells that transiently\noverexpressed recombinant FLAG-Sac1 compared with control VeroE6 cells,\nwhereas VSV-G pseudovirus entry was not affected by recombinant Sac1\nexpression. In transiently transfected cells, recombinant Sac1 was\nindeed present, as shown by the detection of FLAG expression at the N\nterminus of Sac1 (Fig.\n3B). Furthermore, Western blot analysis\nshowed that GFP expression after SARS-CoV S-mediated entry decreased in\nthe recombinant Sac1-expressing cells compared with vector-transfected\nVeroE6 cells (Fig.\n3C). These results indicate that PI4P is\nindispensable for SARS-CoV S-mediated entry and suggest that PI4KB\nmediates SARS-CoV S entry by regulating the level of cellular PI4P.\n\nTo further confirm that PI4KB regulates SARS-CoV S-mediated entry by\ncontrolling the production of PI4P, we monitored the levels of cellular\nPI4P during PI4KB inhibition or ectopic expression of Sac1.\nImmunostaining with an anti-PI4P monoclonal antibody revealed the\nenrichment of PI4P within the cytoplasm of normal cells (Fig. 4A, left\npanel). However, most PI4P immunofluorescence was lost after a\n30-min treatment with LY294002 (Fig.\n4A, right panel). Additionally, the\nreduction of PI4KB by siRNA knockdown greatly affected PI4P levels in\nVeroE6 cells (Fig.\n4B). In parallel, lipid extracts were\nprepared from siRNA-transfected cells and probed for PI4P content using\nPI4P mass strips that contained known loading standards. As shown, PI4KB\ninhibition had a greater effect on lowering PI4P levels in VeroE6 cells\ncompared with PI4KA inhibition, whereas PI3KR1 inhibition increased the\nlevel of PI4P (Fig. 4,\nC and D). The effect of PI3KR1,\nPI4KA, and PI4KB on PI4P levels in VeroE6 cells was in accordance with\ntheir effect on SARS-CoV S-mediated entry. These results suggest that\nPI4KB is responsible for most of the production of PI4P. Next, we\nmonitored the effect of recombinant Sac1 expression on PI4P levels.\nVeroE6 cells were transiently transfected with a FLAG-Sac1 expression\nplasmid. Transfected cells (Fig. 4,\nred) were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence\nusing an anti-FLAG antibody, and PI4P (green) was\ndetected with an anti-PI4P antibody. Confocal images show that PI4P\nlevels in FLAG-Sac1-positive cells were lower than in nontransfected\ncells (Fig. 4E).\nDetection of PI4P from lipid extracts of VeroE6 cells that were\ntransfected with FLAG-Sac1 or a control plasmid revealed that ectopic\nexpression of Sac1 reduced the levels of PI4P in VeroE6 (Fig. 4, F and\nG). These results demonstrate that Sac1 phosphatase\nis a key factor in regulating PI4P levels in VeroE6 cells.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that virus entry is a multistep process. The\nprimary step is often initiated by low affinity binding to attachment\nsites, which promotes the concentration of virions on the cell surface.\nThe subsequent binding to a high affinity receptor triggers cell entry\n(28). After virus binding,\nthe entry of enveloped viruses into cells is known to occur via two\nprimary pathways, membrane fusion or endocytosis (29). To determine whether PI4KB facilitates\nSARS-CoV entry via several stages or via one specific stage, the ACE2\nprotein on the cell surface was characterized by FACS. After siRNA\ntransfection with control siRNA or PI kinase siRNA for 48 h, the\nfluorescence from ACE2 on the cell surface did not decrease compared\nwith the control group, irrespective of the siRNA that was transfected\n(Fig. 5A),\nindicating that the level of cell surface ACE2 remained constant. In\naddition, total ACE2 protein levels in cells were not affected by the\ninhibition of PI kinases, although the synthesis of the PI4KB protein\nwas severely inhibited after transfection of PI4KB siRNA (Fig. 5B). In\naddition, we compared the binding of increasing quantities of a\nrecombinant SARS-CoV RBR (S318\u2013510) to siRNA-treated cells.\nConsistent with the above results, there was no significant difference\nin RBR binding between control siRNA cells or those treated with PI\nkinase siRNAs (Fig.\n5C). To confirm these results, the binding\nof SARS-CoV S to VeroE6 cells was quantified by Western blot analysis.\nEquivalent pseudovirus binding was observed in DMSO-, LY294002- or\nwortmannin-treated VeroE6 cells at 4 \u00b0C (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, we detected\nequivalent quantities of internalized SARS-CoV pseudovirions in VeroE6\ncells at 37 \u00b0C before and after LY294002 or wortmannin treatment\n(Fig. 5D). The\nassociation of SARS-CoV S with cells was specific because neutralizing\nantibody treatment against SARS coronavirus spike protein almost\ncompletely inhibited SARS-CoV S binding and internalization (Fig. 5D). Therefore,\nour results suggest that PI4KB plays a role after virus binding and\ninternalization.\n\nAfter virus binding and internalization, SARS-CoV must fuse with the\nmembrane of the late endosome. Previous studies have shown that\ncathepsin L is sufficient to mediate the fusion process and that the\naddition of exogenous trypsin to cell surface-bound virions can bypass\nthe cathepsin L-dependent entry of SARS-CoV (18). Trypsin promotes fusion at or near the plasma\nmembrane. To localize PI4KB-mediated virus entry, we investigated the\neffect of trypsin treatment on SARS pseudovirion entry into\nPI4KB-inhibited cells. VeroE6 cells pre-incubated with or without\nLY294002 were infected with SARS-CoV S or VSV-G pseudovirions. As\nexpected, LY294002 treatment restricted SARS-CoV S-mediated entry but\nnot entry of VSV-G. In contrast, when SARS-CoV S was bound to cells at 4\n\u00b0C and then incubated briefly with TPCK-trypsin, entry into\nLY294002-treated cells was restored (Fig.\n6A). The percentage of GFP-positive cells\nand total GFP expression confirmed our observations (Fig. 6, B and\nC). These data suggest that PI4KB inhibition cannot\nrestrict trypsin-induced fusion at or near the plasma membrane and that\nPI4KB functions before the viral spike proteins are cleaved by cathepsin\nL in acidic cellular compartments. Taken together, these data indicate\nthat PI4KB is not required for virus binding or internalization but is\nrequired at or before virus fusion.\n\nSARS-CoV entry into target cells is a unique and complex process (30). Currently, several cellular factors have\nbeen demonstrated to be involved with SARS-CoV entry, including\nTNF-\u03b1-converting enzyme, cathepsin L, and IFITM (19, 32, 33). To our knowledge, TNF-\u03b1-converting\nenzyme is activated during SARS-CoV entry and modulates viral entry by inducing ACE2\nreceptor shedding, whereas the cathepsin L and IFITM-mediated restrictions are\nlocalized to late stages of the endocytic pathway. Cathepsin L and IFITM are\nintracellular factors that play opposing roles in SARS-CoV entry. Cathepsin L\nactivates the membrane fusion function of the SARS-CoV spike protein, whereas IFITM\ninhibits that process. These two factors are both independent of viral receptor\nexpression. Apart from this knowledge, little is known about the cellular factors\ninvolved in SARS-CoV entry.\n\nThis study is the first to implicate PI4KB and the PI4P microenvironment in SARS-CoV\nentry. Recently, the independent functions of the PI4P lipids, the most abundant\nmonophosphorylated inositol phospholipids in mammalian cells, have been described,\nshowing that PI4P lipids can alter local membrane curvature and regulate selective\nautophagy and endoplasmic reticulum exit site biogenesis (1). In addition, PI4P lipids can specifically bind to some host\nproteins (1). Moreover, the relationship\nbetween phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase and PI4P in the lipid microenvironment of a\nvirus is gradually being revealed. For example, both enteroviruses and flaviviruses\nexploit host phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase enzymes and replicate their respective\nviral RNAs on PI4P lipid-enriched membranes (5, 10). More recently, Reiss\net al. (8) found that\nelevated levels of the PI4KA product PI4P, which is detected in HCV-infected\ncultured hepatocytes and liver tissues from chronic hepatitis C patients, exhibited\nenzymatic activity via PI4KA that was critical for HCV replication. HCV NS5A was\nfound to interact with PI4KA and stimulate its kinase activity. In our study, we\nexamined the contradictory roles of PI3KR1 and PI4KB, and we investigated the\nmechanisms of SARS-CoV S-mediated entry to determine that PI4P is an indispensable\nelement for entry. Interestingly, this hypothesis was demonstrated by mimicking a\ndepleted PI4P microenvironment by transiently introducing Sac1 into VeroE6 cells.\nHowever, it is still not clear whether other RNA viruses, in addition to SARS-CoV,\nshare similar intracellular molecular events that are important for viral entry.\n\nAn important event during endocytosis of SARS-CoV is cathepsin L proteolysis, which\nactivates the fusion potential of the spike protein in late endosomes (18). Previous studies have shown that trypsin\ntreatment can mediate virus and cell fusion directly at or near the plasma membrane,\nthereby bypassing the dependence on cathepsin L for entry (35). In our experiments, trypsin could also bypass the\ninhibition by LY294002, suggesting that PI4KB assists SARS-CoV entry before virions\nencounter cathepsin L.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that SARS-CoV entry into cells utilizes a novel endocytic\npathway and that its entry is not dependent on clathrin or caveolin-mediated\nendocytosis (36, 37). Therefore, some specific cellular factors may provide\nimportant clues to elucidate this novel entry pathway. PI4KB may be a key factor\ninvolved in SARS-CoV entry, although currently, limited evidence is available to\nidentify the virus entry stage or the cellular organelle where PI4KB is present and\nparticipates in SARS-CoV entry. In consideration of the crucial roles of cathepsin\nL, IFITM, and PI4KB in SARS-CoV entry, further work is required to determine how\nthese intracellular factors mediate SARS-CoV entry at each step and whether they\ninteract.\n\nInterestingly, in this study, PI3KR1, the p85\u03b1 subunit of PI3K, may function\nas an inhibitor of SARS-CoV S-mediated entry at an early stage. Whether the other\nsubunits of PI3K function in the same way as p85\u03b1 remains to be determined.\nBecause there are only two forms of PI3K regulatory subunits and the p85\u03b1\nsubunit accounts for the majority of its activity, we believe that a knockdown of\np85\u03b1 would inhibit most PI3K functions. However, we were unable to determine\nwhether the p85\u03b2 subunit was also involved in SARS-CoV entry; therefore,\nfurther research is needed.\n\nIn this study, we propose the following model for SARS coronavirus spike-mediated\nentry (Fig. 7). PI4KB facilitates SARS-CoV\nS-mediated entry without affecting the ACE2 receptor, whereas PI3KR1 plays an\nopposing role, with both regulating the PI4P microenvironment to promote entry at or\nbefore cathepsin L-mediated virus fusion and potentially further replication. Future\nwork will be necessary to determine the other factors, including host cell proteins,\nthat are involved in this process and to determine how the PI4P microenvironment\ninitiates the next steps for replication.\n\nBased on these discoveries of cell-SARS-CoV interactions, especially the SARS-CoV\nentry process, several types of inhibitors have been implicated for SARS treatment.\nTNF-\u03b1-converting enzyme antagonists that block ACE2 shedding are candidate\nantiviral compounds (31). Small molecule\noxocarbazate inhibitors of human cathepsin L have also been shown to block SARS\npseudotyped virus infection in HEK293T cells (34). In our study, PI4KB is identified as a key factor involved in\nSARS-CoV S-mediated entry, which may provide a potential target for SARS-CoV\ntreatment in the future. Furthermore, small molecules targeting PI4KB may provide a\nbasis for the design of new classes of therapeutics against SARS-CoV infection."}
