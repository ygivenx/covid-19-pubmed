{"title": "Histopathological alterations of lymphatic tissues in cats without feline infectious peritonitis after long-term exposure to FIP virus", "body": "Introduction of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV)-infected animals into a group of coronavirus (CoV)-free cats lead to the outbreak of FIP. Many cats survived the longterm FIPV exposure without even developing clinical symptoms. The purpose of this study was to examine healthy cats which survived long-term natural FIPV exposure in order to evaluate the effects of exposure and to gain possible explanations as to why these animals did not succumb to FIP.\n\nThe study was performed on four groups of cats, consisting of FIPV-exposed SPF cats without FIP (n = 7; Group Ia) and with FIP (n = 3; Group IIa), 2 cats from a breeding colony where FIP cases had recently occurred (Group Ib), 9 routinely necropsied cats with FIP (Group IIb), and 38-(n = 9) and 73-week-old (n = 5) SPF cats (Group III) as FIPV-negative controls. Eleven naturally FIPV-infected cats from various animal shelters served as source of infection (Group IV) for SPF cats (Table 1) . These animals had been tested positive for circulating FCoV immune complexes (see below) and were housed with SPF cats (Groups Ia and IIa) for 30 weeks.\n\nSections from snap-frozen or formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples from spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and thymus were either stained with hematoxylin-eosin or used for immunohistological examinations.\n\nImmunohistology was used for the demonstration of cell populations (T-cells, B-cells, macrophages/neutrophils, follicular dendritic cells), CoV antigen as well as anti-CoV Veterinary Microbiology 69 (1999) 131\u00b1137 antibodies in situ (Kipar et al., 1998) , and the cellular turnover (proliferating (PCNApositive) and apoptotic (TUNEL method) cells) in situ (Table 2) .\n\nIn SPF cats, CoV antibody titres (Osterhaus et al., 1977) and circulating FCoV immune complexes were demonstrated at time points (TP) 0 (age: 9 weeks), 1 (age: 21 weeks), 2 (10 weeks of FIPV exposure), 3 (20 weeks of FIPV exposure), and 4 (30 weeks of FIPV exposure). For demonstration of circulating FCoV immune complexes, a competitive ELISA was performed (Pfeiffer, 1991) . Test serum was treated with polyethylenglycole for precipitation of immune complexes. The resolubilized precipitate was applied to a microtitre plate coated with FIPV (FIPV-DF2). FCoV-containing immune complexes inhibit binding of a mouse monoclonal antibody against FCoV to the FIPV-coated microtiter plate. Thereby, binding of peroxidase-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG is reduced, resulting in lower extinction levels. The threshold value for a positive result had been statistically evaluated (Schroo, 1994) . Virus was isolated from buffy coat monocytes of SPF cats at TP 3 and 4, and cultivated on whole feline embryo (WFE) cells (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998) .\n\nAt necropsy, ingesta was taken for ultrastructural demonstration of CoV particles by negative staining technique (Vieler and Herbst, 1995) , and faeces were investigated for CoV genome by nested RT-PCR (Herrewegh et al., 1995) .\n\nAll FIPV-exposed SPF cats (Group Ia) developed positive CoV antibody titres, demonstrable at TP 2 (n = 5) and 3 (n = 7). Circulating FCoV immune complexes were seen at TP 2 (n = 3) and 3 (n = 6). At the end of the experiment (TP 4), all FIPV-exposed SPF cats were negative for FCoV immune complexes; 2 cats still showed positive antibody titres (Fig. 1) . CoV particles were demonstrated in the ingesta of 3 FIPV-exposed SPF cats (Group Ia), both 11-week-old FIPV-exposed cats without FIP (Group Ib), and 8 cats with FIP (Group II) (Tables 3 and 4 ). Six FIPV-exposed SPF cats (Group Ia), both 11-week-old FIPV-exposed cats without FIP (Group Ib), and 10 cats with FIP (Group II) were positive in the CoV PCR (Tables 3 and 4) .\n\nCoronavirus was isolated from buffy coat monocytes of all FIPV-exposed SPF cats (Group Ia). The cytopathic effect on WFE cells was consistent with that usually seen with Serotype 2 FCoV. Compared to control cats (Group III), all FIPV-exposed cats without FIP (Group I) showed extremely large follicles with extended hypercellular germinal centers and hypercellular T-cell zones. Follicles exhibited a high number of PCNA-positive proliferating cells. Simultaneously, the number of apoptotic cells, mainly visible as apoptotic bodies within tingible body macrophages, was increased. In FIPV-exposed cats without FIP (Group I), macrophages accumulated around lymphoid follicles and T-cell zones, but were rare in the red pulp which was dominated by B and T-cells in approximately equal amounts. In control cats (Group III), the number of macrophages was generally low.\n\nIn comparison, cats with FIP (Group II) exhibited moderately depleted follicles and reduced T-cell zones. The red pulp was dominated by macrophages and showed a higher rate of proliferation than the follicles. Both in FIPV-exposed cats without FIP (Group I) and control cats (Group III), mesenteric lymph nodes were very active and exhibited numerous secondary follicles and broad T-cell zones. In cats with FIP (Group II), moderate to distinct lymphoid depletion was observed. In comparison to both 38-and 72week-old control cats (Group III), FIPV-exposed cats without FIP (Group I) showed a broad hypercellular cortex with numerous tingible body macrophages and a large medullary zone with inconspicious Hassal's corpuscles. The proliferating activity was increased as numerous PCNA-positive thymocytes indicated in both the outer and inner cortex as well as in the medulla. In control cats (Group III), PCNA-positive cells were mostly restricted to the outer cortex. Simultaneously, the number of apoptotic cells was increased in FIPV-exposed cats without FIP (Group I). B-cells, mainly located along the corticomedullary junction, were more numerous in FIPV-exposed cats without FIP (Group I). In general, cats exhibited focal B-cell accumulations at various sites which occasionally formed follicles with follicular dendritic cells. Regardless of age, cats with FIP (Group II) generally exhibited massive to complete thymic atrophy. Thymic tissue was at least reduced to a hypocellular medulla.\n\nIn cats with FIP (Group II), CoV antigen was detected within intact macrophages in granulomatous-necrotizing lesions. In FIPV-exposed cats without FIP (Group I), positive staining for CoV antigen was restricted to single detached intestinal epithelial cells in both 11-week-old kittens (Group Ib). Lymphatic tissues were completely negative in all FIPV exposed cats without FIP (Group I).\n\nBoth in cats with FIP and FIPV-exposed cats without FIP (Groups I and II), plasma cells with CoV-specific antibodies could be demonstrated in variable amounts in the intestinal mucosa, as well as in capsule and medullary cords of mesenteric lymph nodes. In some cats, they were occasionally observed in the splenic red pulp and around blood vessels in the thymic interstitium. In cats with FIP (Group II), they were also seen among infiltrating cells close to areas with CoV antigen-positive macrophages.\n\nResults show that long-term naturally FIPV-exposed cats develop CoV infection and start a CoV-specific immune response regardless of the development of FIP: animals exhibit CoV antibody titres and circulating FCoV immune complexes during exposure. The presence of FCoV immune complexes can be regarded as indicative of an FIPV infection as experimental studies have shown that in FECV-infected cats, circulating FCoV immune complexes only occur occasionally during a short time period after about 3 weeks postinfection. Cats which develop FIP, however, remain positive for a longer time span (Pfeiffer, 1991) . Although virus shedding, indicated by demonstration of CoV particles in the ingesta and CoV genome in faeces (Addie et al., 1996; Foley et al., 1997) , was not consistently detected, CoV isolation supports that all exposed animals were viraemic (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998) . FIPV-exposed cats without FIP exhibit an intensely stimulated immune system, represented by distinct follicular and T-cell hyperplasia in spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, and an hyperplastic thymus. Active mesenteric lymph nodes, however, are also observed in control cats, indicating that already the normal intestinal bacterial flora induces an intense immune activity. Nevertheless, the demonstration of plasma cells positive for CoV-specific antibodies in situ in FIPV-exposed cats support that the observed systemic immune response is CoV-specific (Kipar et al., 1998) .\n\nIn comparison, lymphatic tissues of cats with FIP generally show distinct atrophic changes. T-cell depletion has already been described in cats with FIP (Haagmans et al., 1996; Kipar et al., 1998) . However, our findings indicate that reduction of B-cell areas is also present.\n\nThe development of granulomatous-necrotizing lesions in FIP is thought to be mediated by immune complexes (Jacobse-Geels et al., 1982) . On the other hand, our findings indicate that prevention of FIP obviously requires an even more intense B-cell immune response, accompanied by an increased and effective T-cell response. This does not rule out that lymphocyte depletion also may depend on virus variants which can evolve independently in each infected individual (Herrewegh et al., 1997; Vennema et al., 1998) ."}
