{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Effects of temperature variation and humidity on the death of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China Effects of Temperature Variation and Humidity on the Death of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China \uf020", "body": "J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f parameters on COVID-19 deaths using generalized additive model (GAM).\n\nData from 20 January, 2020 to 29 February, 2020 in Wuhan were compiled, including daily death Environment of the People's Republic of China, respectively. Meteorological variables included daily average temperature, diurnal temperature range (DTR) and relative humidity, and air pollutant data included particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter \u226410 \u03bcm (PM 10 ), particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter \u22642.5 \u03bcm (PM 2.5 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O 3 ). Therefore, there is no need to have ethical review.\n\nAbsolute humidity was calculated according to the previous study and was measured by vapor pressure (VP) (Davis et al., 2016) . The density of water vapor, or absolute humidity [\uf072 v (g/m 3 )], is the mass of moisture per total volume of air. It is associated to VP via the ideal gas law for the moist portion of the air: J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f from ambient temperature and relative humidity using the Clausius-Clapeyron relation (Shaman and Kohn, 2009 ). Briefly, we first calculated the saturation vapor pressure [e s (T) (mb)] from daily ambient temperature using the following equation:\n\nWhere e s (T 0 ) denotes saturation vapor pressure at a reference temperature T 0 (273.15 K) which equals to 6.11 mb. L denotes the latent heat of evaporation for water (2257 kJ/kg). R v is the gas constant for water vapor [461.53 J/(kg K)]. T denotes daily ambient temperature (K). Then, VP (Pa) was calculated by combining the e s (T) calculated using Eq. (2) with relative humidity (RH): VP = 100 * ( ) * 100\n\n(3)\n\nThe descriptive analysis was performed for all the data. We used GAM to analyze the associations between meteorological factors (temperature, DTR, relative humidity and absolute humidity) and the daily death counts of COVID-19. The core analysis was a GAM with a quasi-Poisson link function based on the previous studies (Almeida et al., 2010; Basu et al., 2008) . We first built the basic models for death outcomes without including air pollution or weather variables. We incorporated smoothed spline functions of time, which accommodate nonlinear and nonmonotonic patterns between mortality and time, thus offering a flexible modeling tool. Then, we introduced the weather variables and analyzed their effects on mortality. Akaike's information criterion was used as a measure of how well the model fitted the data. Consistent with several recent time-series studies (Cheng and Kan, 2012; Zeng et al., 2016) , the penalized smoothing spline function was applied to control the effects of confounding factors, such as time trends, day-of-week and air pollution. The core GAM equation is: on day t; \uf061 is the intercept; \u03b2 is the regression coefficient; X t is the daily level of weather variables on day t; s() denotes the smoother based on the penalized smoothing spline. Based on Akaike's information criterion (AIC), the 2 degrees of freedom (df) is used for time trends and 3 df for air pollutants, temperature and relative humidity; DOW is a categorical variable indicating the date of the week.\n\nAfter establishing the core model, we considered the lag effects of weather conditions on death of COVID-19, and examined the potentially lagged effects, i.e., single day lag (from lag 0 to lag 5) and\n\nmultiple-day average lag (from lag 01 to lag 05) (Kan et al., 2007) . The exposure and response correlation curves between weather variables and COVID-19 mortality were fitted using a spline function in the GAM. We also performed a sensitivity analysis by changing the df of the penalized smoothing spline function from 2 to 9 for calendar time and from 3 to 8 for temperature and humidity.\n\nAll the statistical analyses were two-sided at a 5% level of significance. All analyses were conducted using R software (version 3.5.3) with the \"mgcv\" package (version 1.8-27). The effect estimates were expressed as the percentage changes and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in daily death of COVID-19 associated with per 1 unit increase in weather variables.\n\nTemperatures ranged from 1.8 \u00b0C to 18.7 \u00b0C, and DTR ranged from 2 \u00b0C to 17.5 \u00b0C. Average temperature and DTR during this period were 7.44\u00b0C and 9.15 \u00b0C, respectively. The relative humidity and absolute humidity were 59%-97% with an average 82.24% and 4.27 g/m 3 -11.63 g/m 3 with an average 6.69 g/m 3 , respectively. The mean concentrations of PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 , SO 2 , O 3 , and CO were 44.68 \u03bcg/m 3 , 52.56 \u03bcg/m 3 , 23.02 \u03bcg/m 3 , 7.29 \u03bcg/m 3 , 73.76 \u03bcg/m 3 and 0.91 mg/m 3 , respectively. \n\nThe correlation coefficients between death counts of COVID-19, meteorological measures and air pollutant concentrations were presented in Table 2 . The mortality counts of COVID-19 were negatively associated with relative humidity (r = \u22120.32), PM 2.5 (r = \u22120.53) and PM 10 (r = \u22120.45). A positive association with COVID-19 daily mortality was observed for DTR (r = 0.44) and SO 2 (r = 0.31).\n\nFig. 2 showed the exposure-response relationship curves between meteorological factors and COVID-19 mortality at the same day (lag 0). Generally, the curves tended to be not associated with COVID-19 mortality for DTR but were strongly positive for temperature. In addition, the curves associated with relative humidity and absolute humidity presented similar linear trends, which indicated that the higher level of humidity might cause decrease in the COVID-19 mortality. To confirm these results, lag and cumulative effects were discussed in the following analysis. Researchers confirmed that respiratory infection was enhanced during unusually cold and low humidity conditions (Davis et al., 2016) , indicating low humidity might also be an important risk factor for respiratory diseases. A 25-year study found that humidity was an important determinant of mortality, and low-humidity levels might cause a large increase in mortality rates, potentially by influenza-related mechanisms (Barreca, 2012) , similar to a study carried out in the United States (Barreca and Shimshack, 2012) . Consistent to these findings, our results also indicate that the risk of dying from COVID-19 decreases only with absolute humidity increasing. Breathing dry air could cause epithelial damage and/or reduction of mucociliary clearance, and then lead to render the host more susceptible to respiratory virus infection; The formation of droplet nuclei is essential to transmission, but exhaled respiratory droplets settle very rapidly at high humidity so that it is hard to contribute to influenza virus spread (Lowen et al., 2007) . Moreover, the transmission of pandemic influenza virus is efficient under cold, dry conditions (Steel et al., 2011) , and influenza virus survival rate increased markedly in accordance with decreasing of absolute humidity (Shaman et al., 2009 ), which may be very similar to coronavirus. Therefore, the increase of COVID-19 mortality may also be related to the lower humidity in winter. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f "}
