Donor\nprofiles were limited to 18- to 65-year-old nonsmokers with limited alcohol\nconsumption. Upon delivery, the cells were allowed to recover for 24 h in\ncomplete medium with supplement provided by the vendor at 37 \u00b0C. Human\nperipheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from human buffy coats\nobtained from healthy volunteers (Stanford Medical School Blood Center, Palo\nAlto, CA) and maintained in RPMI-1640 with GlutaMAX\u2122\nsupplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin and streptomycin.\nRhesus fresh whole blood was obtained from Valley Biosystems (Sacramento, CA).\nPBMCs were isolated from whole blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient\ncentrifugation. Briefly, blood was overlaid on 15 mL\nFicoll-Paque\u2122 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Piscataway,\nNJ), and centrifuged at 500 \u00d7 g for 20 minutes. The top layer containing\nplatelets and plasma was removed, and the middle layer containing PBMCs was\ntransferred to a fresh tube, diluted with Tris Buffered Saline up to 50 mL, and\ncentrifuged at 500 \u00d7 g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was removed and\nthe cell pellet was resuspended in 5 mL red blood cell lysis buffer (155 mM\nammonium chloride, 10 mM potassium bicarbonate, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). To\ngenerate stimulated PBMCs, freshly isolated quiescent PBMCs were seeded into a\nT-150 cm2 tissue culture flask containing fresh medium supplemented with 10\nunits/mL of recombinant human interleukin-2 (IL-2) and 1 \u03bcg/mL\nphytohemagglutinin-P at a density of 2 \u00d7 106 cells/mL and\nincubated for 72 h at 37\u00b0C. Human macrophage cultures were isolated from\nPBMCs that were purified by Ficoll gradient centrifugation from 50 mL of blood\nfrom healthy human volunteers.

Immortalized\nhuman microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-TERT) were obtained from Dr. Rong\nShao at the Pioneer Valley Life Sciences Institute28. HMVEC-TERT cells were cultured in\nendothelial basal media supplemented with 10% FBS, 5 \u03bcg of\nepithelial growth factor, 0.5 mg hydrocortisone, and\ngentamycin/amphotericin-B.\n\nRNA POLII was purchased as part of the\n\u201cHeLaScribe\u00ae Nuclear Extract in\nvitro Transcription System\u201d kit from Promega. The\nrecombinant human POLRMT and transcription factors mitochondrial transcription\nfactors A (mtTFA or TFAM) and B2 (mtTFB2 or TFB2M) were purchased from Enzymax.\nRSV ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes were prepared according to a method\nmodified from Mason et al.29.\n\nThe intracellular metabolism of GS-5734 was assessed in different cell\ntypes (HMVEC, HeLa, and primary human and rhesus PBMC, monocytes and monocyte\nderived macrophages) following 2-h pulse or 72-h continuous incubations with 10\n\u03bcM GS-5734. For comparison, intracellular metabolism during a 72-h\nincubation with 10 \u03bcM of Nuc was completed in human monocyte derived\nmacrophages. For pulse incubations, monocyte derived macrophages isolated from\nrhesus or human were incubated for 2 h in compound containing media followed by\nremoval, washing with 37\u00b0C drug-free media, and incubated for an\nadditional 22 h in media not containing GS-5734. Human monocyte derived\nmacrophages, HeLa and HMVEC were grown to confluence (approximately 0.5, 0.2,\nand 1.2 \u00d7 106 cells/well, respectively) in 500 \u03bcL of\nmedia in 12 well tissue culture plates. Monocyte and PBMC were incubated in\nsuspension (approximately 1 \u00d7 106 cells/mL) in 1 mL of media\nin micro centrifuge tubes.\n\nFor adherent cells (HMVEC, HeLa, and monocyte derived macrophages),\nmedia was removed at select time points from duplicate wells, cells washed twice\nwith 2 mL of ice cold 0.9% normal saline. For non-adherent cells\n(monocytes and PBMC), duplicate incubation were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 30\nseconds to remove media. The cell pellets were re-suspended with 500 \u03bcL\ncell culture media (RPMI with 10% FBS) and layered on top of a 500\n\u03bcL oil layer (Nyosil M25; Nye Lubricants, Fairhaven, MA) in a\nmicrocentrifuge tube. Samples were then centrifuged at room temperature at\n13,000 rpm for 45 seconds. The media layer was removed and the oil layer was\nwashed twice with 500 \u03bcL water. The oil layer was then carefully removed\nusing a Pasteur pipet attached to vacuum. A volume of 0.5 mL of 70%\nmethanol containing 100 nM of the analytical internal standard\n2-chloro-adenosine-5\u2032-triphosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was\nadded to isolated cells. Samples were stored overnight at \u221220\u00b0C\nto facilitate extraction, centrifuged at 15,000 \u00d7 g for\n15 minutes and then supernatant was transferred to clean tubes for drying in a\nMiVac Duo concentrator (Genevac, Gardiner, NY). Dried samples were then\nreconstituted in mobile phase A containing 3 mM ammonium formate (pH5.0) with 10\nmM dimethylhexylamine (DMH) in water for analysis by liquid chromatography\ncoupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).\n\nLC-MS/MS was done using low flow, ion pairing chromatography similar to\nmethods described previously30. Briefly, analytes were separated using a 50 \u00d7 2 mm\n\u00d7 2.5 \u03bcm Luna C18(2) HST column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA)\nconnected to a LC-20ADXR (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) ternary pump system and HTS\nPAL autosampler (LEAP Technologies, Carrboro, NC). A multi-stage linear gradient\nfrom 10% to 50% acetonitrile in a mobile phase containing 3 mM\nammonium formate (pH 5.0) with 10 mM dimethylhexylamine over 8 minutes at a flow\nrate of 150 \u03bcL/min was used to separate analytes. Detection was\nperformed on an API 4000 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) MS/MS operating\nin positive ion and multiple reaction monitoring modes. Intracellular\nmetabolites Ala-Met, Nuc, NMP, NDP, and NTP were quantified using 7 point\nstandard curves ranging from 0.274 to 200 pmol (approximately 0.5 to 400\n\u03bcM) prepared in cell extract from untreated cells. Levels of adenosine\nnucleotides were also quantified to assure dephosphorylation had not taken place\nduring sample collection and preparation. In order to calculate intracellular\nconcentration of metabolites, the total number of cells per sample were counted\nusing a Countess automated cell counter (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).\n\nAntiviral assays were conducted in biosafety level-4 containment (BSL-4)\nat the CDC. EBOV antiviral assays were conducted in primary HMVEC-TERT and in\nHuh-7 cells. Huh-7 cells were not authenticated and were not tested for\nmycoplasma. Ten concentrations of compound were diluted in 4-fold serial\ndilution increments in media, and 100 \u03bcL per well of each dilution was\ntransferred in duplicate (Huh-7) or quadruplicate (HMVEC-TERT) onto 96-well\nassay plates containing cell monolayers. The plates were transferred to BSL-4\ncontainment, and the appropriate dilution of virus stock was added to test\nplates containing cells and serially diluted compounds. Each plate included four\nwells of infected untreated cells and four wells of uninfected cells that served\nas 0% and 100% virus inhibition controls, respectively. After\nthe infection, assay plates were incubated for 3 days (Huh-7) or 5 days\n(HMVEC-TERT) in a tissue culture incubator. Virus replication was measured by\ndirect fluorescence using a Biotek HTSynergy plate reader. For virus yield\nassays, Huh-7 cells were infected with wild-type EBOV for 1 h at 0.1 pfu per\ncell. The virus inoculum was removed and replaced with 100 \u03bcL per well\nof media containing the appropriate dilution of compound. At 3 days\npost-infection, supernatants were collected, and the amount of virus was\nquantified by endpoint dilution assay. The endpoint dilution assay was conducted\nby preparing serial dilutions of the assay media and adding these dilutions to\nfresh Vero cell monolayers in 96-well plates to determine the tissue culture\ninfectious dose that caused 50% cytopathic effects (TCID50).\nTo measure levels of viral RNA from infected cells, total RNA was extracted\nusing the MagMAX\u2122-96 Total RNA Isolation Kit and quantified\nusing a quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)\nassay with primers and probes specific for the EBOV nucleoprotein gene.\n\nAntiviral assays were conducted in BSL-4 at USAMRIID. HeLa or HFF-1\ncells were seeded at 2,000 cells per well in 384-well plates. Ten serial\ndilutions of compound in triplicate were added directly to the cell cultures\nusing the HP D300 digital dispenser (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA) in 2-fold\ndilution increments starting at 10 \u03bcM at 2 h prior to infection. The\nDMSO concentration in each well was normalized to 1% using an HP D300\ndigital dispenser. The assay plates were transferred to the BSL-4 suite and\ninfected with EBOV-Kikwit at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 pfu per cell for\nHeLa cells and with EBOV-Makona at a multiplicity of infection of 5 pfu per cell\nfor HFF-1 cells. The assay plates were incubated in a tissue culture incubator\nfor 48 h. Infection was terminated by fixing the samples in 10% formalin\nsolution for an additional 48 h prior to immune-staining, as described in Supplementary Table\n1.\n\nAntiviral assays were conducted in BSL-4 at USAMRIID. Primary human\nmacrophage cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 40,000 cells per well. Eight\nto ten serial dilutions of compound in triplicate were added directly to the\ncell cultures using an HP D300 digital dispenser in 3-fold dilution increments 2\nh prior to infection. The concentration of DMSO was normalized to 1% in\nall wells. The plates were transferred into the BSL-4 suite, and the cells were\ninfected with 1 pfu per cell of EBOV in 100 \u03bcL of media and incubated\nfor 1 h. The inoculum was removed, and the media was replaced with fresh media\ncontaining diluted compounds. At 48 h post-infection, virus replication was\nquantified by immuno-staining as described in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nFor antiviral tests, compounds were 3-fold serially diluted in source\nplates from which 100 nL of diluted compound was transferred to a 384-well cell\nculture plate using an Echo acoustic transfer apparatus. HEp-2 cells at a\ndensity of 5 \u00d7 105 cells/mL were then infected by adding RSV\nA2 at a titer of 1 \u00d7 104.5 tissue culture infectious doses\n(TCID50)/mL. Immediately following virus addition, 20 \u03bcL\nof the virus/cell mixture was added to the 384-well cell culture plates using a\n\u03bcFlow liquid dispenser and cultured for 4 days at 37\u00b0C. After\nincubation, the cells were allowed to equilibrate to 25\u00b0C for 30\nminutes. The RSV-induced cytopathic effect was determined by adding 20\n\u03bcL of CellTiter-Glo\u2122 Viability Reagent. After a\n10-minute incubation at 25\u00b0C, cell viability was determined by measuring\nluminescence using an Envision plate reader.\n\nAntiviral assays were conducted in 384-or 96-well plates in BSL-4 at\nUSAMRIID using a high-content imaging system to quantify virus antigen\nproduction as a measure of virus infection. A \u201cno virus\u201d control\nand a \u201c1% DMSO\u201d control were included to determine the\n0% and 100% virus infection, respectively. The primary and\nsecondary antibodies and dyes used for nuclear and cytoplasmic staining are\nlisted in Supplementary Table\n1. The primary antibody specific for a particular viral protein was\ndiluted 1,000-fold in blocking buffer (1\u00d7 PBS with 3% BSA) and\nadded to each well of the assay plate. The assay plates were incubated for 60\nminutes at room temperature. The primary antibody was removed, and the cells\nwere washed 3 times with 1\u00d7 PBS. The secondary detection antibody was an\nanti-mouse (or rabbit) IgG conjugated with Dylight488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific,\nWaltham, MA, Cat. No. 405310). The secondary antibody was diluted 1,000-fold in\nblocking buffer and was added to each well in the assay plate. Assay plates were\nincubated for 60 minutes at room temperature. Nuclei were stained using Draq5\n(Biostatus, Shepshed Leicestershire, UK) or 33342 Hoechst (ThermoFisher\nScientific) for Vero and HFF-1 cell lines. Both dyes were diluted in 1\u00d7\nPBS. The cytoplasm of HFF-1 (EBOV assay) and Vero E6 (MERS assay) cells were\ncounter-stained with CellMask\u2122 Deep Red (Thermo Fisher\nScientific, Waltham, MA). Cell images were acquired using a Perkin Elmer Opera\nconfocal plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) using 10\u00d7 air\nobjective to collect five images per well. Virus-specific antigen was quantified\nby measuring fluorescence emission at a 488 nm wavelength and the stained nuclei\nwere quantified by measuring fluorescence emission at a 640 nm wavelength.\nAcquired images were analyzed using Harmony and Acapella PE software. The Draq5\nsignal was used to generate a nuclei mask to define each nuclei in the image for\nquantification of cell number. The CellMask Deep Red dye was used to demarcate\nthe Vero and HFF-1 cell borders for cell-number quantitation. The viral-antigen\nsignal was compartmentalized within the cell mask. Cells that exhibited antigen\nsignal higher than the selected threshold were counted as positive for viral\ninfection. The ratio of virus positive cells to total number of analyzed cells\nwas used to determine the percent infection for each well on the assay plates.\nEffect of compounds on the viral infection was assessed as percent inhibition of\ninfection in comparison to control wells. The resultant cell number and percent\ninfection were normalized for each assay plate. The Z\u2032 values for all\nantiviral assays were >0.3. Analysis of dose response curve was performed\nusing GeneData Screener software applying Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA)\nfor curve fitting strategy. The curve-fitting process, including individual data\npoint exclusion were pre-specified by default software settings.\nR2-value quantified goodness of fit and fitting strategy was\nconsidered acceptable at R2 > 0.8.\n\nHeLa cells were seeded at 2,000 cells/well in a 384-well plate, and\ncompounds were added to the assay plates. Assay plates were transferred to the\nBSL-4 suite and infected with 1 pfu per cell MARV, which resulted in 50%\nto 70% of the cells expressing virus antigen in a 48-h period.

Virus\ninfection was quantified by immuno-staining using antibodies that recognized the\nviral glycoproteins as described in Supplementary Table 1.\n\nHEp-2 (1.5 \u00d7 103 cells/well) and MT-4 (2 \u00d7\n103 cells/well) cells were plated in 384-well plates and\nincubated with the appropriate medium containing 3-fold serially diluted\ncompound ranging from 15 nM to 100,000 nM. PC-3 (2.5 \u00d7 103\ncells/well), HepG2 (4 \u00d7 103 cells/well), hepatocytes (1\n\u00d7 106 cells/well), quiescent PBMCs (1 \u00d7\n106 cells/well), stimulated PBMCs (2 \u00d7 105\ncells/well), and RPTEC (1 \u00d7 103 cells/well) cells were plated\nin 96-well plates and incubated with the appropriate medium containing 3-fold\nserially diluted compound ranging from 15 nM to 100,000 nM. Cells were cultured\nfor 4\u20135 days at 37\u00b0C. Following the incubation, the cells were\nallowed to equilibrate to 25\u00b0C, and cell viability was determined by\nadding Cell-Titer Glo viability reagent. The mixture was incubated for 10\nminutes, and the luminescence signal was quantified using an Envision plate\nreader. Cell lines were not authenticated and were not tested for mycoplasma as\npart of routine use in cytotoxicity assays.\n\nRNA synthesis by the RSV polymerase was reconstituted in vitro using\npurified RSV L/P complexes and an RNA oligonucleotide template (Dharmacon),\nrepresenting nucleotides 1\u201314 of the RSV leader promoter\n(3\u2032-UGCGCUUUUUUACG-5\u2032)31\u201333. RNA synthesis reactions were performed as described\npreviously, except that the reaction mixture contained 250 \u03bcM rGTP, 10\n\u03bcM rUTP, 10 \u03bcM rCTP, supplemented with 10 \u03bcCi\n[\u03b132P] CTP, and either included 10\n\u03bcM rATP or no ATP. Under these conditions, the polymerase is able to\ninitiate synthesis from the position 3 site of the promoter, but not the\nposition 1 site. The NTP metabolite of GS-5734 was serially diluted in DMSO and\nincluded in each reaction mixture at concentrations of 10, 30, or 100 \u03bcM\nas specified in Fig 1f. RNA products were\nanalyzed by electrophoresis on a 25% polyacrylamide gel, containing 7M\nurea, in tris-taurine-EDTA buffer, and radiolabelled RNA products were detected\nby autoradiography.\n\nTranscription reactions contained 25 \u03bcg of crude RSV RNP\ncomplexes in 30 \u03bcL of reaction buffer (50 mM TRIS-acetate [pH\n8.0], 120 mM potassium acetate, 5% glycerol, 4.5 mM\nMgCl2, 3 mM DTT, 2 mM EGTA, 50 \u03bcg/mL BSA, 2.5 U RNasin,\n20 \u03bcM ATP, 100 \u03bcM GTP, 100 \u03bcM UTP, 100 \u03bcM CTP,\nand 1.5 \u03bcCi [\u03b1-32P]ATP [3,000\nCi/mmol]). The radiolabeled nucleotide used in the transcription assay\nwas selected to match the nucleotide analog being evaluated for inhibition of\nRSV RNP transcription.\n\nTo determine whether nucleotide analogs inhibited RSV RNP transcription,\ncompounds were added using a 6-step serial dilution in 5-fold increments. After\na 90-minute incubation at 30\u00b0C, the RNP, reactions were stopped with 350\n\u03bcL of Qiagen RLT lysis buffer, and the RNA was purified using a Qiagen\nRNeasy 96 kit. Purified RNA was denatured in RNA sample loading buffer at\n65\u00b0C for 10 minutes and run on a 1.2% agarose/MOPS gel\ncontaining 2M formaldehyde. The agarose gel was dried, exposed to a Storm\nphosphorimaging screen, and developed using a Storm phosphorimager.\n\nFor a 25 \u03bcL reaction mixture, 7.5 \u03bcL 1\u00d7\ntranscription buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.2\u20137.5], 100 mM\nKCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 20% glycerol), 3 mM MgCl2, 100\nng CMV-(+) control DNA, and a natural mixture of NTPs were pre-incubated\nwith various concentrations (0 \u03bcM to 500 \u03bcM) of the inhibitor at\n30\u00b0C for 5 minutes. The natural mixture of NTPs contained 5\u201325\n\u03bcM (equal to Km) of the competing\n33P-labeled NTP and 400 \u03bcM of the other three NTPs. The\nreaction was started by addition of 3.5 \u03bcL of HeLa+Extract.\nAfter 1 h of incubation at 30\u00b0C, the polymerase reaction was stopped by\naddition of 10.6 \u03bcL Proteinase K mixture that contained final\nconcentrations of 2.5 \u03bcg/\u03bcL Proteinase K, 5% SDS, and 25\nmM EDTA. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 3\u201312 h, 10 \u03bcL of\nthe reaction mixture was mixed with 10 \u03bcL of the loading dye\n(98% formamide, 0.1% xylene cyanol and 0.1% bromophenol\nblue), heated at 75\u00b0C for 5 minutes, and loaded onto a 6%\npolyacrylamide gel (8 M urea). The gel was dried for 45 minutes at 70\u00b0C\nand exposed to a phosphorimager screen. The full length product, 363 nucleotide\nrunoff RNA, was quantified using a Typhoon Trio Imager and Image Quant TL\nSoftware.\n\nTwenty nanomolar POLRMT was incubated with 20 nM template plasmid\n(pUC18-LSP) containing POLRMT light-strand promoter region and transcription\nfactors mtTFA (100 nM) and mtTFB2 (20 nM) in buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH\n7.5), 20 mM NaCl, 10 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, and 10 mM MgCl234. The reaction mixture was\npre-incubated to 32\u00b0C, and the reactions were initiated by addition of\n2.5 \u03bcM of each of the natural NTPs and 1.5 \u03bcCi of\n32P-GTP. After incubation for 30 minutes at 32\u00b0C, reactions\nwere spotted on DE81 paper and quantified.\n\nA homology model of RSVA2 and EBOV polymerases were built using the\nHIV-RT X-ray crystal structure (PDB:1RTD). (Schr\u00f6dinger Release 2015-1:\nPrime, version 3.9, Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2015, default\nsettings with subsequent rigid body minimization and side chain optimization.\nLoop insertions not in 1RTD of greater than 10 amino acids were not built).\n\nFor quantitative assessment of viral RNA nonhuman primate plasma\nsamples, whole blood was collected using a K3 EDTA Greiner Vacuette tube (or\nequivalent) and sample centrifuged at 2500 (\u00b1 200) RCF for 10 \u00b1\n2 min. To inactivate virus, plasma was treated with 3 parts (300 \u03bcL)\nTriReagent LS and samples were transferred to frozen storage\n(\u221260\u00b0C to \u221290\u00b0C), until removal for RNA\nextraction. Carrier RNA and QuantiFast High Concentration Internal Control\n(Qiagen) were spiked into the sample prior to extraction, conducted according to\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. The viral RNA was eluted in AVE Buffer.\nEach extracted RNA sample was tested with the QuantiFast Internal Control RT-PCR\nRNA Assay (Qiagen) to evaluate the yield of the spiked-in QuantiFast High\nConcentration Internal Control. If the internal control amplified within\nmanufacturer-designated ranges, further quantitative analysis of the viral\ntarget was performed. RT-PCR was conducted using an ABI 7500 Fast Dx using\nprimers specific to EBOV glycoprotein. Samples were run in triplicate using a 5\n\u03bcL template volume. For quantitative assessments, the average of the\ntriplicate genomic equivalents (ge) per reaction were determined and multiplied\nby 800 to obtain ge/mL of plasma. Standard curves were generated using synthetic\nRNA. The limits of quantification for this assay are 8.0 \u00d7\n104 \u2013 8.0 \u00d7 1010 ge/mL of plasma.\nAcceptance criteria for positive template control (PTC), negative template\ncontrol (NTC), negative extraction control (NEC), and positive extraction\ncontrol (PEC) are SOP-specified. For qualitative assessments, the limit of\ndetection (LOD) was defined as Ct 38.07, based on method validation testing. An\nanimal was considered to have tested positive for detection of EBOV RNA when a\nminimum of 2 of 3 replicates were designated as \u201cpositive\u201d and\nPTC, NTC, and NEC controls meet specified method-acceptance criteria. A sample\nwas designated as \u201cpositive\u201d when the Ct value was <LOD\nCt.\n\nThree uninfected male rhesus monkeys (Macaca\nmaniculata) were used for the pharmacokinetic study. GS-5734 was\nformulated in solution at 5 mg/mL with 12%\nsulfobutylether-\u03b2-cyclodextrin in water, pH 3.5\u20134.0, and 2 mL/kg\nwas administered by slow bolus (approximately 1 min) for a final dose of 10\nmg/kg. Blood samples for plasma and PBMC were collected from a femoral\nvein/artery and were taken from each monkey over a 24-h period. Plasma samples\nwere obtained at predose and at 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h postdose.\nPBMC samples were obtained at 2, 4, 8, and 24 h. Blood samples for plasma were\ncollected into chilled collection tubes containing sodium fluoride/potassium\noxalate (NaF/K-Ox) as the anticoagulant and were immediately placed on wet ice,\nfollowed by centrifugation to obtain plasma. Blood samples for PBMC isolation\nwere collected at room temperature into CPT vacutainer tubes containing sodium\nheparin for isolation. Plasma and isolated PBMC samples were frozen immediately\nand stored at \u226460\u00b0C until analyzed.\n\nFor plasma analysis, an aliquot of 25 \u03bcL of each plasma sample\nwas treated with 100 \u03bcL of 90% methanol and acetonitrile mixture\n(1:1, v:v) and 10% water with 20 nM 5-(2-aminopropyl)indole as an\ninternal standard. One hundred microliters of samples were filtered through an\nAgilent Captiva 96 well 0.2 \u03bcm filter plate. Filtered samples were dried\ndown completely for approximately 20 minutes and reconstituted with 1%\nacetonitrile and 99% water with 0.01% formic acid. An aliquot of\n10 \u03bcL was injected for LC-MS/MS using a HTC Pal autosampler. Analytes\nwere separated on a Phenomenex Synergi Hydro-RP 30A column (75 \u00d7 2.0 mm,\n4.0 \u03bcm) using a Waters Acquity ultra performance LC (Waters Corporation,\nMilford, MA, USA), a flow rate of 0.26 mL/min, and a gradient from Mobile phase\nA containing 0.2% formic acid in 99% water and 1%\nacetonitrile to mobile phase B containing 0.2% formic acid in\n95% acetonitrile and 5% water over 4.5 minutes. MS/MS analysis\nused a Waters Xevo TQ-S in positive multiple reaction monitoring mode using an\nelectrospray probe. Plasma concentrations of GS-734, Ala-Met and Nuc were\ndetermined using an 8-point calibration curve spanning a concentration range of\nover 3 orders of magnitude. Quality control samples run at the beginning and end\nof the run to ensure accuracy and precision within 20%. Intracellular\nmetabolites in PBMC were quantified by LC-MS/MS as described above for in vitro\nactivation studies.\n\nSix cynomolgus monkeys were administered a single dose of\n[14C]GS-5734 at 10 mg/kg (25 \u03bcCi/kg) by\nIV administration (slow bolus). Tissues were collected from 3 animals at 4 and\n168 h post dose. The tissues were excised, rinsed with saline, blotted dry,\nweighed, and placed on wet ice. Tissues (testes, epididymis, eyes and brain;\nfollowing homogenization) and plasma were analyzed by liquid scintillation\ncounting. Concentrations were converted to ng equivalents of GS-5734 per gram of\nsample.\n\nRhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were challenged on day\n0 by intramuscular injection with a target dose of 1000 pfu of EBOV-Kikwit\n(Ebola virus H.sapiens-tc/COD/1995/Kikwit), which was derived from a clinical\nspecimen obtained during an outbreak occurring in The Democratic Republic of the\nCongo (formerly Zaire) in 1995. Challenge virus was propagated from the clinical\nspecimen using cultured cells (Vero or Vero E6) for a total of four passages.\nAnimals (3\u20136 years) were randomly assigned to experimental treatment\ngroups, stratified by sex (with equal number of males and females per group) and\nbalanced by body weight, using SAS\u00ae statistical software\n(Cary, North Carolina, USA). Study personnel responsible for assessing animal\nhealth (including euthanasia assessment) and administering treatments were\nexperimentally blinded to group assignment of animals. The primary endpoint for\nefficacy studies was survival to day 28 following virus challenge. GS-5734 was\nformulated at Gilead Sciences in water with 12%\nsulfobutylether-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (SBE-\u03b2-CD), pH adjusted to 3.0\nusing HCl. Formulations were administered to anesthetized animals by bolus\nintravenous injection at a rate of approximately 1 min/dose in the right or left\nsaphenous vein. The volume of all vehicle or GS-5734 injections was 2.0 mL/kg\nbody weight. Animals were anesthetized using IM injection of a solution\ncontaining ketamine (100 mg/mL) and acepromazine (10 mg/mL) at 0.1 mL/kg body\nweight.\n\nAnimals were observed at least twice daily to monitor for disease signs,\nand animals that survived to day 28 were deemed to be protected. Study personnel\nalleviated unnecessary suffering of infected animals by euthanizing clinically\nmoribund animals. The criteria used as the basis for euthanasia of moribund\nanimals were defined prior to study initiation and included magnitude of\nresponsiveness, reduced body temperature, and/or specified alterations to serum\nchemistry parameters35. Serum\nchemistry was analyzed using a Vitros 350 Chemistry System (Ortho Clinical\nDiagnostics), and coagulation parameters were evaluated using a Sysmex CA-1500\ncoagulation analyzer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). Hematology analysis was\nconducted using a Siemens Advia 120 Hematology System with multispecies software\n(Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics). On days in which GS-5734 or vehicle dosing\nwere scheduled with blood sample collection for clinical pathology or viremia\nanalysis, blood samples were collected immediately prior to dose\nadministration.\n\nAnalysis of viral genomic sequence was conducted with the purpose of\nevaluating genomic sequence change patterns consistent with development of\nresistance against GS-5734. Attempts were made to obtain sequence of\nRNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (L) of Ebola virus from all\nEBOV-RNA positive rhesus monkey plasma samples obtained during the efficacy\nstudies. Deep sequencing screening of the L gene was completed\nusing previously described methods36,37. Mutations\nand large sub clonal events (\u226510% of population) were reviewed\nfor: non-synonymous substitutions in treated animals that succumbed to\ninfection, any substitution enriched in treated populations regardless of\nsurvival status and clusters of substitutions in any treated animal.\n\ncDNA synthesis was performed using Invitrogen\u2019s Superscript III\nFirst-Strand Synthesis System. cDNA was amplified with Phusion Hot Start Flex\nDNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) using overlapping 1,500-kb amplicons\n(primer information available upon request). After pooling and purification with\nAMPure XP Reagent (Beckman Coulter), PCR products were fragmented using the\nCovaris S2 instrument (Covaris). Libraries were prepared with the Illumina\nTruSeq DNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina) on the Caliper ScicloneG3 Liquid\nHandling Station (PerkinElmer). After measurement by real-time PCR with the KAPA\nqPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems), libraries were diluted to 4 or 10 nM. Cluster\namplification was performed on the Illumina cBot, and libraries were sequenced\non the Illumina Nextseq or Illumina HiSeq 2500 using the 150 or 100 bp\npaired-end format. Viral assemblies were completed in DNAStar Lasergene nGen.\nAmplification primer removal, quality trimming, and trim-to-mer were performed\non reads with a minimum similarity to the reference of 93% (four-base\nmismatch). A target depth of 1200 is sought and SNPs at positions with fewer\nthan 200 read depth were removed from the analysis. A consensus change was\ndefined as a change relative to the deposited EBOV sequence (GenBank\n#AY354458) present in \u226550% of the population. Below that\nthreshold, SNPs were considered sub-clonal substitutions and part of a minority\nsubpopulation of the virus. Consensus sequence for the region covered in this\nscreening is available in Genbank and the accession numbers are provided in\nExtended Data Table 5.\n\nPharmacokinetic and radiolabeled tissue distribution studies in\nuninfected cynomolgus and rhesus macaques were conducted at Covance, Inc.\n(Madison, WI). Protocols were reviewed by an Institutional Animal Care and Use\nCommittee (IACUC) at Covance. Efficacy experiments involving EBOV were performed\nin ABSL-4 at USAMRIID. Research was conducted under an Institutional Animal Care\nand Use Committee approved protocol in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act,\nPHS Policy, and other federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and\nexperiments involving animals. The facilities where this research was conducted\nare accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory\nAnimal Care, International and strictly adhere to principles stated in the Guide\nfor the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council, 2011\n(National Academies Press, Washington, DC.).\n\nCombined vehicle group from Part 1 and 2 (N = 6 animals total)\nwas used as control group in all statistical comparisons. The impact of GS-5734\ntreatment on the survival rates was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and\nanalyzed by log-rank analysis using Dunnett-Hsu procedure to adjust for multiple\ncomparisons. The effect on systemic viral RNA levels was assessed by the\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing each GS-5734 treatment group with vehicle\ngroup using Dunnett\u2019s test to adjust for multiple comparisons. Wilcoxon\nrank-sum test without adjustment for multiple comparisons was used to compare\nthe effects of GS-5734 treatment on hematology, coagulation and clinical\nchemistry parameters. All data met the statistical assumptions of the test\nperformed."}
