{"title": "Alpha-ketoamides as broad-spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus and enterovirus replication Structure-based design, synthesis, and activity assessment", "body": "Seventeen years have passed since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, but there is yet no approved treatment for infections with the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 1 One of the reasons is that despite the devastating consequences of SARS for the affected patients, the development of an antiviral drug against this virus would not be commercially viable in view of the fact that the virus has been rapidly contained and did not reappear since 2004. As a result, we were empty-handed when the Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a close relative of SARS-CoV, emerged in 2012. 2 MERS is characterized by severe respiratory disease, quite similar to SARS, but in addition frequently causes renal failure 3 . Although the number of registered MERS cases is low (2494 as of November 30, 2019; www.who.int), the threat MERS-CoV poses to global public health may be even more serious than that presented by SARS-CoV. This is related to the high casefatality rate (about 35%, compared to 10% for SARS), and to the fact that MERS cases are still accumulating seven years after the discovery of the virus, whereas the SARS outbreak was essentially contained within 6 months. The potential for human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has been impressively demonstrated by the 2015 outbreak in South Korea, where 186 cases could be traced back to a single infected traveller returning from the Middle East. 4 SARS-like coronaviruses are still circulating in bats in China, [5] [6] [7] [8] from where they may spill over into the human population; this is probably what caused the current outbreak of atypical pneumonia in Wuhan, which is linked to a seafood and animal market. The RNA genome (Gen-Bank accession code: MN908947.2; http://virological.org/t/initialgenome-release-of-novel-coronavirus/319, last accessed on January 11, 2020) of the new betacoronavirus features around 82% identity to that of SARS-CoV.\n\nIn spite of the considerable threat posed by SARS-CoV and related viruses, as well as by MERS-CoV, it is obvious that the number of cases so far does not warrant the commercial development of an antiviral drug targeting MERS-and SARS-CoV even if a projected steady growth of the number of MERS cases is taken into account. A possible solution to the problem could be the development of broadspectrum antiviral drugs that are directed against the major viral protease, a target that is shared by all coronavirus genera as well as, in a related form, by members of the large genus Enterovirus in the picornavirus family. Among the members of the genus Alphacoronavirus are the human coronaviruses (HCoV) NL63 (ref. 9) and 229E 10 that usually cause only mild respiratory symptoms in otherwise healthy individuals, but are much more widespread than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Therapeutic intervention against alphacoronaviruses is indicated in cases of accompanying disease such as cystic fibrosis 11 or leukemia, 12 or certain other underlying medical conditions. 13 The enteroviruses include pathogens such as EV-D68, the causative agent of the 2014 outbreak of the \"summer flu\" in the US, 14 EV-A71 and Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16), the etiological agents of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD), 15 Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), which can cause myocardic inflammation, 16 and human rhinoviruses (HRV), notoriously known to lead to the common cold but also capable of causing exacerbations of asthma and COPD. 17 Infection with some of these viruses can lead to serious outcome; thus, EV-D68 can cause polio-like disease, 18 and EV-A71 infection can proceed to aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, pulmonary edema, viral myocarditis, and acute flaccid paralysis. 15, [19] [20] Enteroviruses cause clinical disease much more frequently than coronaviruses, so that an antiviral drug targeting both virus families should be commercially viable.\n\nHowever, enteroviruses are very different from coronaviruses. While both of them have a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity, that of enteroviruses is very small (just 7 -9 kb) whereas coronaviruses feature the largest RNA genome known to date (27 -34 kb) . Enteroviruses are small, naked particles, whereas coronaviruses are much larger and enveloped. Nevertheless, a related feature shared by these two groups of viruses is their type of major protease, 21 which in the enteroviruses is encoded by the 3C region of the genome (hence the protease is designated 3C pro ). In coronaviruses, non-structural protein 5 (Nsp5) is the main protease (M pro ). Similar to the enteroviral 3C pro , it is a cysteine protease in the vast majority of cases and has therefore also been called \"3C-like protease\" (3CL pro ). The first crystal structure of a CoV M pro or 3CL pro (ref. 22) revealed that two of the three domains of the enzyme together resemble the chymotrypsin-like fold of the enteroviral 3C pro , but there is an additional a-helical domain that is involved in the dimerization of the protease (Fig. 1A) . This dimerization is essential for the catalytic activity of the CoV M pro , whereas the enteroviral 3C pro (Fig. 1B) functions as a monomer. Further, the enteroviral 3C pro features a classical Cys...His...Glu/Asp catalytic triad, whereas the CoV M pro only has a Cys...His dyad. 22 Yet, there are a number of common features shared between the two types of proteases, in particular their almost absolute requirement for Gln in the P1 position of the substrate and space for only small amino-acid residues such as Gly, Ala, or Ser in the P1' position, encouraging us to explore the coronaviral M pro and the enteroviral 3C pro as a common target for the design of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds. The fact that there is no known human protease with a specificity for Gln at the cleavage site of the substrate increases the attractivity of this viral target, as there is hope that the inhibitors to be developed will not show toxicity versus the host cell. Indeed, neither the enterovirus 3C pro inhibitor rupintrivir, which was developed as a treatment of the common cold caused by HRV, nor the peptide aldehyde inhibitor of the coronavirus M pro that was recently demonstrated to lead to complete recovery of cats from the normally fatal infection with Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV), showed any toxic effects on humans or cats, respectively. 23, 24 Figure 1: Crystal structures of SARS-CoV main protease (M pro , ref. 26 ; PDB entry 2BX4) and Coxsackivirus B3 3C protease (3C pro ; Tan et al., unpublished; PDB entry 3ZYD). Catalytic residues are indicated by spheres (yellow, Cys; blue, His; red: Glu). A. The coronavirus M pro is a homodimer, with each monomer comprising three domains. B. The structure of the monomeric CVB3 3C pro resembles the Nterminal two domains of the SARS-CoV M pro . Structure is on the same scale as image A. C. Superimpostion of residues from the two structures involved in ligand binding. Superimposition was carried out by aligning the catalytic Cys-His pair of each protease. Residues of the SARS-CoV M pro are shown with carbon atoms in cyan, CVB3 3C pro residues have orange carbons and are labeled with an asterisk (*).\n\nAs the proteases targeted in our study all specifically cleave the peptide bond following a P1-glutamine residue (HCoV-NL63 M pro uniquely also accepts P1 = His at the Nsp13/Nsp14 cleavage site 31 ), we decided to use a 5-membered ring (g-lactam) derivative of glutamine (henceforth called GlnLactam) as the P1 residue in all our aketoamides (see Scheme 1). This moiety has been found to be a good mimic of glutamine and enhance the power of the inhibitors by up to 10-fold, most probably because compared to the flexible glutamine side-chain, the more rigid lactam leads to a reduction of the loss of entropy upon binding to the target protease. 29, 32 Our synthetic efforts therefore aimed at optimizing the substituents at the P1', P2, and P3 positions of the a-ketoamides.\n\nSynthesis (Scheme 1) started with the dianionic alkylation of N-Boc glutamic acid dimethyl ester with bromoacetonitrile. As expected, this alkylation occurred in a highly stereoselective manner, giving 1 as the exclusive product. In the following step, the cyano group of 1 was subjected to hydrogenation. The in-situ cyclization of the resulting intermediate afforded the lactam 2. The lactam derivative 3 was generated by removal of the protecting group of 2. On the other hand, the amidation of acyl chloride and a-amino acid methyl ester afforded the intermediates 4, which gave rise to the acids 5 via alkaline hydrolysis. The key intermediates 6 were obtained via the condensation of the lactam derivative 3 and the N-capped amino acids 5. The ester group of compounds 6 was then reduced to the corresponding alcohol. Oxidation of the alcohol products 7 by Dess-Martin periodinane generated the aldehydes 8, which followed by nucleophilic addition with isocyanides gave rise to compounds 9 under acidic conditions. Then, the a-hydroxyamides 10 were prepared by removing the acetyl group of compounds 9. In the final step, the oxidation of the exposed alcohol group in compounds 10 generated our target a-ketoamides 11.\n\nThe inhibitory potencies of candidate a-ketoamides were evaluated against purified recombinant SARS-CoV M pro , HCoV-NL63 M pro , CVB3 3C pro , and EV-A71 3C pro . The most potent compounds were further tested against viral replicons and against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, or a whole range of enteroviruses in cell culture-based assays (Tables 1 -3 and Supplementary Table 1 \n\nTo enable the rapid and biosafe screening of antivirals against corona-and enteroviruses, a non-infectious, but replication-competent SARS-CoV replicon was used 33 along with subgenomic replicons of CVB3 34 and EV-A71 (kind gift of B. Zhang, Wuhan, China). The easily detectable reporter activity (firefly or Renilla luciferase) of these replicons has previously been shown to reflect viral RNA synthesis. [33] [34] [35] In-vitro RNA transcripts of the enteroviral replicons were also used for transfection. For the SARS-CoV replicon containing the CMV promoter, only the plasmid DNA was used for transfection.\n\nThe initial compound to be designed and synthesized was 11a, which carries a cinnamoyl N-cap in the P3 position, a benzyl group in P2, the glutamine lactam (GlnLactam) in P1, and benzyl in P1' (Table  1) . This compound showed good to mediocre activities against recombinant SARS-CoV M pro (IC50 = 1.95 \u00b5M; for all compounds, see Tables 1 -3 for standard deviations), CVB3 3C pro (IC50 = 6.6 \u00b5M), and EV-A71 3C pro (IC50 = 1.2 \u00b5M), but was surprisingly completely inactive (IC50 > 50 \u00b5M) against HCoV-NL63 M pro . These values were mirrored in the SARS-CoV and in the enterovirus replicons (Table 2) . In virus-infected cell cultures, the results obtained were also good to mediocre (Table 3) : SARS-CoV (EC50 = 5.8 \u00b5M in Vero E6 cells), MERS-CoV (EC50 = 0.0047 \u00b5M in Huh7 cells), HCoV 229E (EC50 = 11.8 \u00b5M in Huh7 cells), or a host of enteroviruses (EC50 = 9.8 \u00b5M against EV-A71 in RD cells; EC50 = 0.48 \u00b5M against EV-D68 in HeLa Rh cells; EC50 = 5.6 \u00b5M against HRV2 in HeLa Rh cells). In all cell types tested, the compound generally proved to be non-toxic, with selectivity indices (CC50/EC50) usually >10 (Table 3) .\n\nCrystal structures of compound 11a in complex with SARS-CoV M pro , HCoV-NL63 M pro , and CVB3 3C pro demonstrated that the aketo-carbon is covalently linked to the active-site Cys (no. 145, 144, and 147, resp.) of the protease (Fig. 2, 3a-c) . The resulting thiohemiketal is in the R configuration in the SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 M pro but in the S configuration in the CVB3 3C pro complex. The reason for this difference is that the oxygen atom of the thiohemiketal accepts a hydrogen bond from the catalytic His40 in the CVB3 protease, rather than from the main-chain amides of the oxyanion hole as in the SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 enzymes (Fig. 3a ,b,c insets). It is remarkable that we succeeded in obtaining a crystal structure of compound 11a in complex with the HCoV-NL63 M pro , even though it has no inhibitory effect on the activity of the enzyme (IC50 > 50 \u00b5M), (Fig. 2c) . Apparently, the compound is able to bind to this M pro in the absence of peptide substrate, but cannot compete with substrate for the binding site due to low affinity. A similar observation has been made in one of our previous studies, where we were able to determine the crystal structure of a complex between the inactive Michaelacceptor compound SG74 and the EV-D68 3C pro (ref. 29 ; PDB entry 3ZV9).

Fo -Fc difference density (contoured at 3s) for 11a in the substrate-binding site of the SARS-CoV M pro (transparent surface). Selected side-chains of the protease are shown with green carbon atoms. B. Another view of 11a in the substrate binding site of the SARS-CoV M pro . Note the \"lid\" formed by residue Met49 and its neighbors above the S2 pocket. C. 11a in the substrate-binding site of HCoV-NL63 M pro . Because of the restricted size of the S2 pocket, the P2 benzyl group of the compound cannot enter deeply into this site. Note that the S2 pocket is also covered by a \"lid\" centred around Thr47. D. 11a in the substrate-binding site of the CVB3 3C pro . The S2 site is large and not covered by a \"lid\".\n\nThe crystal structures indicated that the fits of the P1' benzyl group of 11a in the S1' pocket and of the P3 cinnamoyl cap in the S3 subsite might be improved (see Fig. 3a -c). Compounds 11b -11e and 11g -11l were synthesized in an attempt to do so; however, none of them showed better inhibitory activity against the majority of the recombinant proteases, compared to the parent compound, 11a (see Supplementary Results). To investigate whether the P3 residue of the inhibitor is dispensible, we synthesized compound 11f, which only comprises P2 = Boc, P1 = GlnLactam, and P1' = benzyl. 11f was inactive against all purified proteases and in all replicons tested, but showed some activity against HRV2 in HeLa Rh cells (EC50 = 9.0 \u00b5M). A crystal structure of 11f bound to HCoV-NL63 M pro demonstrated that the P2-Boc group entered the S2 pocket (Fig. 3d ). In conclusion, although there is probably room for further improvement, we decided to maintain the original design with P1' = benzyl and P3 = cinnamoyl, and focussed on improving the P2 substituen.\n\nThe crystal structures of SARS-CoV M pro , HCoV-NL63 M pro , and CVB3 3C pro in complex with 11a revealed a fundamental difference between the S2 pockets of the coronavirus proteases and the enterovirus proteases: The cavities are covered by a \"lid\" in the former but are open to one side in the latter (Fig. 2,b-d) . In SARS-CoV M pro , the lid is formed by the 310 helix 46 -51 and in HCoV-NL63 M pro by the loop 43-48. Residues from the lid, in particular Met49 in the case of SARS-CoV M pro , can thus make hydrophobic interactions with the P2 substitutent of the inhibitor, whereas such interaction is missing in the enterovirus 3C pro s. In addition to the lid, the S2 pocket is lined by the \"back-wall\" (main-chain atoms of residues 186 and 188 and Cb atom of Asp187), the side-walls (Gln189, His41), as well as the \"floor\" (Met165) in SARS-CoV M pro . In HCoV-NL63 M pro , the corresponding structural elements are main-chain atoms of residues 187 and 188 as well as the Cb atom of Asp187 (back-wall), Pro189 and His41 (side-walls), and Ile165 (floor). Finally, in CVB3 3C pro , Arg39, Asn69, and Glu71 form the back-wall, residues 127-132 and His40 form the side-walls, and Val162 constitutes the floor.\n\nIn addition, the S2 pocket is of different size in the various proteases. The SARS-CoV enzyme features the largest S2 pocket, with a volume of 252 \u00c5 3 embraced by the residues (Gln189, His41) defining the side-walls of the pocket in the ligand-free enzyme, as calculated by using Chimera, 36 followed by the CVB3 3C pro S2 pocket with about 180 \u00c5 3 (space between Thr130 and His40). The HCoV-NL63 M pro has by far the smallest S2 pocket of the three enzymes, with a free space of only 45 \u00c5 3 between Pro189 and His41, according to Chimera.\n\nIn agreement with these observations, a good fit is observed between the P2 benzyl group of 11a and the S2 subsite of the SARS-CoV M pro as well as that of the CVB3 3C pro (Fig. 3a,c) . In contrast, the crystal structure of the complex between 11a and HCoV-NL63 M pro , against which the compound is inactive, demonstrates that the P2-benzyl group cannot fully enter the S2 pocket of the enzyme because of the restricted size of this site (Fig. 3b) .\n\nThus, the properties of our target proteases with respect to the S2 pocket were defined at this point as \"small\" and \"covered by a lid\" for HCoV-NL63 M pro , \"large\" and \"covered\" for SARS-CoV M pro , and \"large\" and \"open\" for CVB3 3C pro . Through comparison with crystal structures of other proteases of the same virus genus (HCoV-229E M pro for alphacoronaviruses 28 (PDB entry 1P9S); HKU4 M pro for betacoronaviruses (Ma, Xiao et al., unpublished; PDB entry 2YNA); and EV-A71 3C pro for enteroviruses 30 (PDB entry 3SGK), we ensured that our conclusions drawn from the template structures were valid for other family members as well.\n\nTo explore the sensitivity of the S2 pocket towards a polar substituent in the para position of the benzyl group, we synthesized compound 11m carrying a 4-fluorobenzyl group in P2. This substitution abolished almost all activity against the SARS-CoV M pro (IC50 > 50 \u00b5M), and the compound proved inactive against HCoV-NL63 M pro as well, whereas IC50 values were 2.3 \u00b5M against the EV-A71 3C pro and 8.7 \u00b5M against CVB3 3C pro . From this, we concluded that the introduction of the polar fluorine atom is not compatible with the geometry of the S2 pocket of SARS-CoV M pro , whereas the fluorine can accept a hydrogen bond from Arg39 in EV-A71 3C pro (ref. 30 ) and probably also CVB3 3C pro . In SARS-CoV M pro , however, the carbonyl groups of residues 186 and 188 might lead to a repulsion of the fluorinated benzyl group. author/funder. All rights reserved.

The thiohemiketal is in the R configuration, with its oxygen accepting two hydrogen bonds from the oxyanion-hole amides of Gly143 and Cys145. The amide oxygen accepts an H-bond from His41. The side-chains of Ser144 and Arg188 have been omitted for clarity. B. The P2-benzyl substituent of 11a cannot fully enter the S2 pocket of the HCoV-NL63 M pro , which is much smaller and has less plasticity than the corresponding pocket of SARS-CoV M pro (cf. A). The benzyl therefore binds above the pocket in the view shown here; this is probably the reason for the total inactivity (IC50 > 50 \u00b5M) of compound 11a against HCoV-NL63 M pro . The small size of the pocket is due to the replacement of the flexible Gln189 of the SARS-CoV M pro by the more rigid Pro189 in this enzyme. The stereochemistry of the thiohemiketal is R. The sidechains of Ala143 and Gln188 have been omitted for clarity. C. Binding of 11a to the CVB3 3C pro . The stereochemistry of the thiohemiketal is S, as the group accepts a hydrogen bond from His41, whereas the amide keto group accepts three H-bonds from the oxyanion hole (residues 145 -147). The side-chain of Gln146 has been omitted for clarity. D. The crystal structure of 11f in complex with HCoV-NL63 M pro shows that this short (inactive) compound lacking a P3 residue has its P2-Boc group inserted into the S2 pocket of the protease. The stereochemistry of the thiohemiketal is S. The sidechains of Ala143 and Gln188 have been omitted for clarity. E. In contrast to P2 = benzyl in 11a, the isobutyl group of 11n is small and flexible enough to enter into the narrow S2 pocket of the HCoV-NL63 M pro . The thiohemiketal is in the R configuration. The side-chains of Ala143 and Gln188 have been omitted for clarity. F. In spite of its small size, the cyclopropylmethyl side-chain in the P2 position of 11s can tightly bind to the S2 subsite of the SARS-CoV M pro , as this pocket exhibits pronounced plasticity due to the conformational flexibility of Gln189 (see also Fig. 4 ). The stereochemistry of the thiohemiketal is S. The side-chains of Ser144 and Arg188 have been omitted for clarity.\n\nAs the P2-benzyl group of 11a was apparently too large to fit into the S2 pocket of the HCoV-NL63 M pro , we replaced it by isobutyl in 11n. This resulted in improved activities against SARS-CoV M pro (IC50 = 0.33 \u00b5M) and in a very good activity against HCoV-NL63 M pro (IC50 = 1.08 \u00b5M, compare with the inactive 11a). For EV-A71 3C pro , however, the activity decreased to IC50 = 13.8 \u00b5M, different from CVB3 3C pro , where IC50 was 3.8 \u00b5M. Our interpretation of this result is that the smaller P2-isobutyl substituent of 11n can still interact with the \"lid\" (in particular, Met49) of the SARS-CoV M pro S2 site, but is unable to reach the \"back-wall\" of the EV-A71 3C pro pocket and thus, in the absence of a \"lid\", cannot generate sufficient enthalpy of binding. We will see from examples to follow that this trend persists among all inhibitors with a smaller P2 substituent: Even though the SARS-CoV M pro S2 pocket has a larger volume than that of the enterovirus 3C pro , the enzyme can be efficiently inhibited by compounds carrying a small P2 residue that makes hydrophobic interactions with the lid (Met49) and floor (Met165) residues.\n\nThe EC50 of 11n was >10 \u00b5M against the EV-A71 and CVB3 replicons, and even in the SARS-CoV replicon, the activity of 11n was relatively weak (EC50 = 7.0 \u00b5M; Table 2 ). In agreement with the replicon data, 11n proved inactive against EV-A71 in RD cells and showed limited activity against HRV2 or HRV14 in HeLa Rh cells (Table 3) . Only the comparatively good activity (EC50 = 4.4 \u00b5M) against EV-D68 in HeLa Rh cells was unexpected. The activity of 11n against HCoV 229E in Huh7 cells was good (EC50 = 0.6 \u00b5M), and against MERS-CoV in Huh7 cells, it was excellent, with EC50 = 0.0048 \u00b5M, while in Vero cells, the EC50 against MERS-CoV was as high as 9.2 \u00b5M. Similarly, the EC50 against SARS-CoV in Vero cells was 14.2 \u00b5M (Table 3) .\n\nWe managed to obtain crystals of 11n in complex with the M pro of HCoV NL63 and found the P2 isobutyl group to be well embedded in the S2 pocket (Fig. 3e) . This is not only a consequence of the smaller size of the isobutyl group compared to the benzyl group, but also of its larger conformational flexibility, which allows a better fit to the binding site.\n\nWhen we replaced the P2-isobutyl residue of 11n by n-butyl in 11o, the activities were as follows: IC50 = 8.5 \u00b5M for SARS-CoV M pro , totally inactive (IC50 > 50 \u00b5M) against HCoV-NL63 M pro , IC50 = 3.2 \u00b5M for EV-A71 3C pro , and 5.2 \u00b5M for CVB3 3C pro . The decreased activity in case of SARS-CoV M pro and the total inactivity against HCoV-NL63 M pro indicate that the n-butyl chain is too long for the S2 pocket of these proteases, whereas the slight improvement against EV-A71 3C pro and CVB3 3C pro is probably a consequence of the extra space that is available to long and flexible substituents because of the lack of a lid covering the enterovirus 3C pro pocket.\n\nAs the n-butyl substituent in P2 of 11o was obviously too long, we next synthesized a derivative with the shorter propargyl (ethinylmethyl) as the P2 residue (compound 11p). This led to very mediocre activities against all tested proteases. Using cyclopropyl as the P2 residue (compound 11q), the IC50 values were even higher against most of the proteases tested. Obviously, the P2 side-chain requires a methylene group in the b-position in order to provide the necessary flexibility for the substituent to be embedded in the S2 pocket.\n\nHaving realized that in addition to size, flexibility of the P2 substituent may be an important factor influencing inhibitory activity, we introduced flexibility into the phenyl ring of 11a by reducing it. The cyclohexylmethyl derivative 11r exhibited IC50 = 0.7 \u00b5M against SARS-CoV M pro , 12.3 \u00b5M against HCoV-NL63 M pro , 1.7 \u00b5M against EV-A71 3C pro , and 0.9 \u00b5M against CVB3 3C pro .

Even for the HCoV-NL63 M pro , against which 11a was completely inactive, greatly improved albeit still weak activity was observed (Table 1 ). In the viral replicons, 11r performed very well, with EC50 = 0.8 -0.9 \u00b5M for the EV-A71 replicon, 0.45 \u00b5M for CVB3, and 1.4 \u00b5M for SARS-CoV (Table 2 ). In the virus-infected cell culture assays (Table 3) , 11r exhibited EC50 = 3.7 \u00b5M against EV-A71 in RD cells and EC50 = 0.48 -0.7 \u00b5M against EV-D68, HRV2, and HRV14 in HeLa cells. Against HCoV 229E in Huh7 cells, the EC50 was surprisingly low (1.8 \u00b5M). Interestingly, the compound proved extremely potent against MERS-CoV in Huh7 cells, with EC50 = 0.0004 \u00b5M (400 picomolar!). Even in Vero cells, EC50 against MERS-CoV was 5 \u00b5M, and the EC50 against SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells was 1.8 -2.1 \u00b5M, i.e. the best activity we have seen for an M pro inhibitor against SARS-CoV in this type of cells. The therapeutic index (CC50/EC50) of 11r against EV-D68, HRV2, and HRV14 was >15 in HeLa Rh cells as well as against CVB3 in Huh-T7 cells, but only ~5 for EV-A71 in RD cells.\n\nAt this point, we decided to systematically vary the size of the ring system in P2. The next substituent to be tried was cyclopropylmethyl (compound 11s, which showed good activities against SARS-CoV M pro (IC50 = 0.24 \u00b5M) and HCoV-NL63 M pro (1.4 \u00b5M), but poor values against EV-A71 3C pro (IC50 = 18.5 \u00b5M) and CVB3 3C pro (IC50 = 4.3 \u00b5M) (Table 1) . 11s was shown to inhibit the SARS-CoV replicon with an EC50 of about 2 \u00b5M, whereas activity against the EV-A71 and CVB3 replicons was poor (EC50 values > 20 \u00b5M) ( Table 2 ). The replicon results were mirrored by the antiviral activity of 11s in enterovirus-infected cells (Table 3) , which was weak or very weak. By contrast, the compound inhibited HCoV 229E and MERS-CoV in Huh7 cells with EC50 of 1.3 and 0.08 \u00b5M, respectively. The activity against the latter virus in Vero cells was poor (EC50 ~11 \u00b5M), and so was the anti-SARS-CoV activity in Vero E6 cells (Table 3) .\n\nWe next analyzed the crystal structure of the complex between SARS-CoV M pro and compound 11s (Fig. 3f) . The cyclopropylmethyl substituent was found to be incorporated deeply into the S2 pocket, making hydrophobic interactions with Met49 (the lid), Met165 (the floor), and the Cb of Asp187 (the back-wall). In spite of the small size of the P2 substituent, this is possible because the S2 pocket of SARS-CoV M pro is flexible enough to contract and enclose the P2 moiety tightly. This plasticity is expressed in a conformational change of residue Gln189, both in the main chain and in the side-chain. The main-chain conformational change is connected with a flip of the peptide between Gln189 and Thr190. The c1 torsion angle of the Gln189 side-chain changes from roughly antiperiplanar (ap) to (-)synclinal (-sc) (Fig. 4) . The conformational variability of Gln189 has been noted before, both in Molecular Dynamics simulations 26 and in other crystal structures. 37 As a consequence of these changes, the sidechain oxygen of Gln189 can accept a 2.54-\u00c5 hydrogen bond from the main-chain NH of the P2 residue in the 11s complex (see Fig. 4 ). The affinity of 11s for the S2 pocket of HCoV-NL63 M pro is good because of an almost ideal match of size and not requiring conformational changes, which this enzyme would not be able to undergo because of the replacement of the flexible Gln189 by the more rigid Pro. On the other hand, docking of the same compound into the crystal structure of the CVB3 3C pro revealed that the cyclopropylmethyl moiety was probably unable to generate sufficient Free Energy of binding because of the missing lid and the large size of the S2 pocket in the enterovirus 3C pro , thereby explaining the poor inhibitory activity of 11s against these targets. (Table 1) . Experiments with the viral replicons confirmed this trend, although the EC50 value for SARS-CoV (6.8 \u00b5M) was surprisingly high (Table 2 ). In Huh7 cells infected with MERS-CoV, this compound exhibited EC50 = 0.1 \u00b5M (but 9.8 \u00b5M in Vero cells), whereas EC50 was 7.0 \u00b5M against SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells. The compound was largely inactive against EV-A71 in RD cells and inhibited the replication of the two HRV subtypes tested (in HeLa Rh cells) with EC50 values of ~4 \u00b5M. The CC50 of 11t in HeLa cells was 65 \u00b5M, i.e. the therapeutic index was well above 15 (Table 3) .\n\nObviously, this substituent was still a bit too small for the enterovirus proteases, so as the next step, we tested P2 = cyclopentylmethyl (compound 11u). This turned out to be the one compound with acceptable IC50 values against all tested enzymes: 1.3 \u00b5M against SARS-CoV M pro , 5.4 \u00b5M against HCoV-NL63 M pro , 4.7 \u00b5M against EV-A71 3C pro , and 1.9 \u00b5M against CVB3 3C pro ( Table 1 ). The activity against the replicons was between 3.6 and 4.9 \u00b5M ( Table 2 ). In Huh7 cells infected with HCoV 229E or MERS-CoV, 11u showed EC50 = 2.5 or 0.03 \u00b5M (11.1 \u00b5M for MERS-CoV in Vero cells), while EC50 was 4.9 \u00b5M against SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells (Table 3) .\n\n11u appeared so far the best compromise compound, yet for each of the individual viral enzymes, the following compounds proved superior: P2 = cyclopropylmethyl (compound 11s) for SARS-CoV M pro , P2 = isobutyl (compound 11n) and P2 = cyclopropylmethyl (11s) for HCoV-NL63 M pro , P2 = benzyl (11a) or cyclohexylmethyl (11r) for EV-A71 3C pro , and 11r for CVB3 3C pro . In other words, the nearly equipotent 11u is indeed a compromise. Therefore, in view of the surprisingly good antiviral activity of 11r against HCoV 229E in Huh7 cells, we relaxed the condition that the universal inhibitor should show good activity against the recombinant HCoV-NL63 M pro , and selected 11r (P2 = cyclohexylmethyl) as the lead compound for further development. This compound exhibited submicromolar IC50 values against CVB3 3C pro and SARS-CoV M pro , and IC50 = 1.7 \u00b5M against EV-A71 3C pro (Table 1) , as well as similarly low EC50 values in the replicons of these viruses (Table 2 ). In Huh7 cells infected with MERS-CoV, the performance of this compound was excellent, with EC50 = 0.0004 \u00b5M, and even against HCoV 229E in Huh7 cells and SARS-CoV in Vero E6 cells, EC50 values of 1.8 and 2.1 \u00b5M, respectively, were observed (Table 3) . Also in enterovirus-infected cell culture, the compound performed well, with EC50 values of 0.7 \u00b5M or below against HRV2, HRV14, and EV-D68 in HeLa (Rh) cells and selectivity values >15. The only concern is the activity of the compound against EV-A71 in RD cells, for which the EC50 value was 3.7 \u00b5M, resulting in too low a therapeutic index. On the other hand, only weak toxicity was detected for 11r in Vero or Huh-T7 cells. Preliminary pharmacokinetics tests with the compound in mice did not indicate a toxicity problem (to be published elsewhere).\n\nWe describe here the structure-based design, the synthesis, and the assessment of capped dipeptide a-ketoamides that target the main protease of alpha-or betacoronaviruses as well as the 3C protease of enteroviruses. Through crystallographic analyses of a total of six inhibitor complexes of three different proteases in this study, we found the a-ketoamide warhead (-CO-CO-NH-) to be sterically more versatile than other warheads such as Michael acceptors (-CH=CH-CO-) and aldehydes (-CH=O), because it features two acceptors for hydrogen bonds from the protein, namely the a-keto oxygen and the amide oxygen, whereas the other warheads have only one such acceptor. In the various complexes, the hydroxy group (or oxyanion) of the thiohemiketal that is formed by the nucleophilic attack of the activesite cysteine residue onto the a-keto carbon, can accept one or two hydrogen bonds from the main-chain amides of the oxyanion hole. In addition, the amide oxygen of the inhibitor accepts a hydrogen bond from the catalytic His side-chain. Alternatively, the thiohemiketal can interact with the catalytic His residue and the amide oxygen with the main-chain amides of the oxyanion hole. Depending on the exact interaction, the stereochemistry at the thiohemiketal C atom would be different. We have previously observed a similar difference in case of aldehyde inhibitors, where the single interaction point -the oxyanion of the thiohemiacetal -can accept a hydrogen bond either from the oxyanion hole or from the catalytic His side-chain, 37 resulting in different stereochemistry of the thiohemiacetal carbon. Both aketoamides and aldehydes react reversibly with the catalytic nucleophile of proteases, whereas Michael acceptors form irreversible adducts.\n\nIn addition to better matching the H-bonding donor/acceptor properties of the catalytic center through offering two hydrogen-bond acceptors instead of one, a-ketoamides have another big advantage over aldehydes and a,b-unsaturated esters (Michael acceptors) in that they allow easy extension of the inhibitors to probe the primed specificity subsites beyond S1', although this has so far rarely been explored (e.g., ref. 38 in case of calpain).\n\nThe most prominent a-ketoamide drugs are probably telaprivir and boceprivir, peptidomimetic inhibitors of the HCV NS3/4A protease, 39, 40 which have helped revolutionize the treatment of chronic HCV infections. For viral cysteine proteases, a-ketoamides have only occasionally been described as inhibitors and few systematic studies have been carried out.\n\nA number of capped dipeptidyl a-ketoamides have been described as inhibitors of the norovirus 3C-like protease. 41 These were optimized with respect to their P1' substituent, whereas P2 was isobutyl in most cases and occasionally benzyl. The former displayed IC50 values one order of magnitude lower than the latter, indicating that the S2 pocket of the norovirus 3CL protease is fairly small. Although we did not include the norovirus 3CL pro in our study, expanding the target range of our inhibitors to norovirus is probably a realistic undertaking. While our study was underway, Zeng et al. 42 published a series of a-ketoamides as inhibitors of the EV-A71 3C pro . These authors mainly studied the structure-activity relationships of the P1' residue and found small alkyl substituents to be superior to larger ones. Interestingly, they also reported that a six-membered d-lactam in the P1 position led to 2 -3 times higher activities, compared to the fivemembered g-lactam. At the same time, Kim et al. 43 described a series of five a-ketoamides with P1' = cyclopropyl that showed submicromolar activity against EV-D68 and two HRV strains.\n\nOccasionally, individual a-ketoamides have been reported in the literature as inhibitors of both the enterovirus 3C protease and the coronavirus main protease. A single capped dipeptidyl a-ketoamide, Cbz-Leu-GlnLactam-CO-CO-NH-iPr, was described that inhibited the recombinant transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and SARS-CoV M pro s as well as human rhinovirus and poliovirus 3C pro s in the one-digit micromolar range. 44 Coded GC-375, this compound showed poor activity in cell culture against EV-A71 though (EC50 = 15.2 \u00b5M), probably because P2 was isobutyl. As we have shown here, an isobutyl side-chain in the P2 position of the inhibitors is too small to completely fill the S2 pocket of the EV-A71 3C pro and the CVB3 3C pro .\n\nAmong a series of aldehydes, Prior et al. 45 described the capped tripeptidyl a-ketoamide Cbz-1-naphthylalanine-Leu-GlnLactam-CO-CO-NH-iPr, which showed IC50 values in the 3-digit nanomolar range against HRV 3C pro and SARS-CoV M pro , as well as EC50 values of 0.03 \u00b5M against HRV18 and 0.5 \u00b5M against HCoV 229E in cell culture. No optimization of this compound was performed and no toxicity data have been reported.\n\nFor compounds with warheads other than a-ketoamides, in-vitro activity against both corona-and enteroviruses has also occasionally been reported. Lee et al. 46 described three peptidyl Michael acceptors that displayed inhibitory activity against the M pro s of SARS-CoV and HCoV 229E as well as against the 3C pro of CVB3. These inhibitors had an IC50 10 -20 times higher for the CVB3 enzyme, compared to SARS-CoV M pro . P2 was invariably isobutyl (leucine) in these compounds, suggesting that further improvement might be possible.\n\nIn addition to Michael acceptors, peptide aldehydes have also been used to explore the inhibition of coronavirus M pro s as well as enterovirus 3C pro s. Kim et al. 44 reported a dipeptidyl aldehyde and its bisulfite adduct, both of which exhibited good inhibitory activities against the isolated 3C proteases of human rhinovirus and poliovirus as well as against the 3C-like proteases of a number of coronaviruses, but antiviral activities in cell culture against EV-A71 were poor (EC50 >10 \u00b5M), again most probably due to P2 being isobutyl (leucine).\n\nIn our series of compounds, we used P1 = GlnLactam (g-lactam) throughout, because this substituent has proven to be an excellent surrogate for glutamine. 29, 32 While we made some efforts to optimize the P1' residue of the compounds as well as the N-cap (P3), we mainly focussed on optimization of the P2 substituent. In nearly all studies aiming at discovering peptidomimetic inhibitors of coronavirus M pro s, P2 is invariably isobutyl (leucine), and this residue has also been used in the efforts to design compounds that would inhibit enterovirus 3C pro s as well (see above). From crystal structures of our early lead compound, 11a (cinnamoyl-Phe-GlnLactam-CO-CO-NH-Bz), in complex with the M pro s of HCoV NL63 (as representative of the alphacoronavirus proteases) and SARS-CoV (beta-CoV) as well as the 3C pro of Coxsackievirus B3 (enterovirus proteases), we found that the S2 pocket has fundamentally different shapes in these enzymes. In the SARS-CoV M pro , the S2 subsite is a deep hydrophobic pocket that is truly three-dimensional in shape: the \"walls\" of the groove are formed by the polypeptide main chain around residues 186 -188 as well as by the side-chains of His41 (of the catalytic dyad) and Gln189, whereas the \"floor\" is formed by Met165 and the \"lid\" by residues 45 -51, in particular Met49. The two methionines provide important interaction points for the P2 substituents of inhibitors; while these interactions are mostly hydrophobic in character, we have previously described the surprising observation of the carboxylate of an aspartic residue in P2 that made polar interactions with the sulfur atoms of these methionines. 37 Because the pocket offers so many opportunities for interaction and features a pronounced plasticity, P2 substituents such as isobutyl (from Leu), which are too small to fill the pocket entirely, can still generate sufficient binding enthalpy. Accordingly, the S2 pocket of SARS-CoV M pro is the most tolerant among the three enzymes investigated here, in terms of versatility of the P2-substituents accepted.\n\nIn the S2 pocket of the HCoV-NL63 M pro , Gln189 is replaced by proline and this change is accompanied by a significant loss of flexibility; whereas the side-chain of Gln189 of SARS-CoV M pro is found to accommodate its conformation according to the steric requirements of the P2 substituent, the proline is less flexible, leading to a much smaller space at the entrance to the pocket. As a consequence, a P2benzyl substituent is hindered from penetrating deeply into the pocket, whereas the smaller and more flexible isobutyl group of P2-Leu is not.\n\nFinally, in the 3C pro s of EV-A71 and CVB3, the S2 pocket lacks a lid, i.e. it is open to one side. As a consequence, it offers less interaction points for P2 substituents of inhibitors, so that such substituents must reach the \"back-wall\" of the pocket (formed by Arg39, Asn69, Glu71) in order to create sufficient binding energy. Hence, large aromatic substituents such as benzyl are favored by the enterovirus 3C pro s.\n\nWhen we introduced a fluoro substituent in the para position of the P2-benzyl group of our lead compound, 11a, we observed good activity against the enterovirus 3C pro s but complete inactivity against the coronavirus M pro s (see Table 1 , compound 11m). This is easily explained on the basis of the crystal structures: In the enterovirus 3C pro s, the fluorine can accept a hydrogen bond from Arg39 (ref. 30) , whereas in the coronavirus M pro s, there would be electrostatic repulsion from the main-chain carbonyls of residues 186 and 188. In agreement with this, rupintrivir (which has P2 = p-fluorobenzyl) is a good inhibitor of the enteroviral 3C pro s, 46 but not of the coronaviral main proteases, as we predicted earlier. 28 In this structure-based inhibitor optimization study, we achieved major improvements over our original lead compound, 11a, by systematically varying the size and the flexibility of the P2-substituent. The compound presenting so far the best compromise between the different requirements of the S2 pockets (SARS-CoV M pro : large and covered, HCoV-NL63 M pro : small and covered, and CVB3 3C pro : large and open) is 11u (P2 = cyclopentylmethyl), which has satisfactory broad-spectrum activity against all proteases tested. However, with regard to its antiviral activities in cell cultures, it is inferior to 11r (P2 = cyclohexylmethyl). The latter compound exhibits very good inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV M pro as well as the enterovirus 3C pro , and its performance in the SARS-CoV and enterovirus replicons is convincing. Being in the low micromolar range (EV-A71, CVB3), the data for the antiviral activity in cell culture for 11r correlate well with the inhibitory power of the compound against the recombinant proteases as well as in the replicon-based assays. This is not true, though, for the surprisingly good in-cellulo activity of 11r against HCoV 229E in Huh7 cells. Also, the correlation does not seem to hold for LLC-MK2 and CaCo2 cells. We tested the antiviral activity of many of our compounds against HCoV NL63 in these two cell types and found that all of them had low-or submicromolar EC50 values against this virus in LLC-MK2 cells but were largely inactive in CaCo2 cells (not shown). Furthermore, 11r and all other compounds that we synthesized are inactive (EC50 > 87 \u00b5M) against CVB3 in Vero cells (not shown), but exhibit good to excellent activities against the same virus in Huh-T7 cells. We have previously observed similar poor antiviral activities in Vero cells not only for aketoamides, but also for Michael acceptors (Zhu et al., unpublished work) . A similar cell-type dependence is seen for the antiviral activity of 11r against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Whereas the inhibitor exhibits excellent activity against MERS-CoV when Huh7 cells are the host cells (400 pM), the inhibitory activity is weaker by a factor of up to 12,500 when Vero cells are used (EC50 = 5 \u00b5M). On the other hand, 11r exhibits excellent anti-MERS-CoV activity in human Calu3 lung cells, i.e. in the primary target cells where the compound will have to act in a therapeutic setting (A. Kupke, personal communication). As we tested antiviral activity against SARS-CoV exclusively in Vero cells, the EC50 values determined for our compounds against this virus are in the one-digit micromolar range or higher; the best is again compound 11r with EC50 = 2.1 \u00b5M. Interestingly, the relatively weaker activity (or even inactivity) of our inhibitors against RNA viruses in Vero cells was observed independently in the virology laboratories in Leuven and in Leiden. It is thus unlikely that the lack of activity in Vero cells is related to problems with the experimental set-up. In preliminary experiments, we replaced the P3 cinnamoyl group of 11r by the fluorophor coumaryl and found by fluorescence microscopy that much more inhibitor appeared to accumulate in Huh7 cells compared to Vero cells (D.L., R.H. & Irina Majoul, unpublished).\n\nRegardless of which cell system is the most suitable one for the testing of peptidomimetic antiviral compounds, we next plan to test 11r in small-animal models for MERS and for Coxsackievirusinduced pancreatitis. In parallel, we aim to refine the experiments to quantify the accumulation of peptidomimetic protease inhibitors in different host-cell types, in the hope to find an explanation for the observed cell-type dependencies.\n\nThis work demonstrates the power of structure-based approaches in the design of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds with roughly equipotent activity against coronaviruses and enteroviruses. We observed a good correlation between the inhibitory activity of the designed compounds against the isolated proteases, in viral replicons, and in virus-infected Huh7 cells. One of the compounds (11r) exhibits excellent anti-MERS-CoV activity in virus-infected Huh7 cells. Because of the high similarity between the main proteases of SARS-CoV and the novel BetaCoV/Wuhan/2019, we expect 11r to exhibit good antiviral activity against the new coronavirus as well.\n\nCrystallization. The recombinant production and purification of SARS-CoV M pro with authentic N and C termini was described in detail previously. 48, 49 Using an Amicon YM10 membrane (EMD Millipore), the purified SARS-CoV M pro was concentrated to 21 mg\u00b7mL -1 in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). Crystallization was performed by equilibrating 1 \u00b5L protein (mixed with 1 \u00b5L precipitant solution) against 500 \u00b5l reservoir containing 6 -8% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6,000, 0.1 M MES (pH 6.0), at 20\u2103 using the vapor diffusion sitting-drop method. Compounds 11a and 11s were dissolved in 100% DMSO at 50 mM and 200 mM stock concentrations, respectively. A crystal of the free enzyme was soaked in cryo-protectant buffer containing 20% MPD, 6% PEG 6,000, 0.1 M MES, 7.5 mM 11a, pH 6.0, for 2 h at 20\u2103. Another set of free enzyme crystals was soaked in another cryoprotectant buffer with 6% PEG 6,000, 5% MPD, 0.1 M MES, 15% glycerol, 10 mM 11s, pH 6.0, for 2 h. Subsequently, crystals were fished and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen prior to data collection.\n\nCrystals of HCoV-NL63 M pro with 11a were obtained using cocrystallization. The concentrated HCoV-NL63 M pro (45 mg\u00b7mL -1 ) was incubated with 5 mM 11a for 4 h at 20\u2103, followed by setting up crystallization using the vapor diffusion sitting-drop method at 20\u2103 with equilibration of 1 \u00b5L protein (mixed with 1 \u00b5L mother liquor) against 500 \u00b5L reservoir composed of 0.1 M lithium sulfate monohydrate, 0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate, 25% PEG 1,000, pH 6.0. The crystals were protected by a cryo-buffer containing 0.1 M lithium sulfate monohydrate, 0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate, 25% PEG 1,000, 15% glycerol, 2 mM 11a, pH 6.0 and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen.\n\nCrystals of HCoV-NL63 M pro with 11n or 11f were generated by using the soaking method. Several free-enzyme crystals were soaked in cryo-protectant buffer containing 0.1 M lithium sulfate monohydrate, 0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate, 25% PEG 1,000, 15% glycerol, 5 mM 11n (or 11f), pH 6.0. Subsequently, the soaked crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen.\n\nFreshly prepared CVB3 3C pro at a concentration of 21.8 mg\u00b7mL -1 was incubated with 5 mM 11a pre-dissolved in 100% DMSO at room tempature for 1 h. Some white precipitate appeared in the mixture. Afterwards, the sample was centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 20 min at 4 \u2103. The supernatant was subjected to crystallization trials using the following, commercially available kits: Sigma TM (Sigma-Aldrich), Index TM , and PEG Rx TM (Hampton Research). Single rod-like crystals were detected both from the Index TM screen, under the condition of 0.1 M MgCl2 hexahydrate, 0.1 M Bis-Tris, 25% PEG 3,350, pH 5.5, and from the Sigma TM screen at 0.2 M Li2SO4, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 30% PEG 4,000, pH 8.5. Crystal optimization was performed by using the vapor-diffusion sitting-drop method, with 1 \u03bcL CVB3 3C pro -inhibitor complex mixed with 1 \u03bcL precipitant solution, and equilibration against 500 \u03bcL reservoir containing 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.2 M MgCl2, pH 8.5, and PEG 3,350 varied from 22% to 27%. Another optimization screen was also performed against a different reservoir, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.2 M MgCl2, pH range from 7.5 to 8.5, and PEG 4,000 varied from 24% to 34%. Crystals were fished from different drops and protected by cryo-protectant solution consisting of the mother liquor and 10% glycerol. Subsequently, the crystals were flash-cooled with liquid nitrogen.\n\nDiffraction data collection, structure elucidation and refinement. Diffraction data from the crystal of the SARS-CoV M pro in complex with 11a were collected at 100 K at synchrotron beamline PXI-X06SA (PSI, Villigen, Switzerland) using a Pilatus 6M detector (DECTRIS). A diffraction data set from the SARS-CoV M pro crystal with compound 11s was collected at 100 K at beamline P11 of PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg, Germany), using the same type of detector. All diffraction data sets of HCoV-NL63 M pro complex structures and of the complex of CVB3 3C pro with 11a were collected at synchrotron beamline BL14.2 of BESSY (Berlin, Germany), using an MX225 CCD detector (Rayonics). All data sets were processed by the program XDSAPP and scaled by SCALA from the CCP4 suite. [50] [51] [52] The structure of SARS-CoV M pro with 11a was determined by molecular replacement with the structure of the complex between SARS-CoV M pro and SG85 (PDB entry 3TNT; Zhu et al., unpublished) as search model, employing the MOLREP program (also from the CCP4 suite). 52, 53 The complex structures of HCoV-NL63 M pro with 11a, 11f, and 11n were also determined with MOLREP, using as a search model the structure of the free enzyme determined by us (LZ et al., unpublished) . The complex structure between CVB3 3C pro and 11a was determined based on the search model of the free-enzyme structure (PDB entry 3ZYD; Tan et al., unpublished) . Geometric restraints for the compounds 11a, 11f, 11n, and 11s were generated by using JLIGAND 52, 54 and built into Fo-Fc difference density using the COOT software. 55 Refinement of the structures was performed with REFMAC version 5.8.0131 (ref. 52, 56, 57) .\n\nA buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.3, was used for all the enzymatic assays. Two substrates with the cleavage sites of M pro and 3C pro , respectively (indicated by the arrow, \u2193), Dabcyl-KTSAVLQ\u00afSGFRKM-E(Edans)-NH2 and Dabcyl-KEALFQ\u00afGPPQF-E(Edans)-NH2 (95% purity; Biosyntan), were employed in the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)based cleavage assay, using a 96-well microtiter plate. The dequenching of the Edans fluorescence due to the cleavage of the substrate as catalyzed by the proteases was monitored at 460 nm with excitation at 360 nm, using a Flx800 fluorescence spectrophotometer (BioTek). Curves of relative fluorescence units (RFU) against substrate concentration were linear for all substrates up to beyond 50 \u00b5M, indicating a minimal influence of the inner-filter effect. Stock solutions of the compounds were prepared by dissolving them in 100% DMSO. The UV absorption of 11a was found to be negligible at l = 360 nm, so that no interference with the FRET signal through the inner-filter effect was to be expected. For the determination of the IC50, different proteases at a specified final concentration (0.5 \u00b5M SARS-CoV or HCoV-NL63 M pro , 2 \u00b5M CVB3 3C pro , 3 \u00b5M EV-A71 3C pro ) were separately incubated with the inhibitor at various concentrations (0 to 100 \u03bcM) in reaction buffer at 37\u2103 for 10 min. Afterwards, the reaction was initiated by adding FRET peptide substrate at 20 \u03bcM final concentration (final volume: 50 \u03bcl). The IC50 value was determined by using the GraphPad Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad). Measurements of enzymatic activity were performed in triplicate and are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviations (SD).\n\nAssessment of inhibitory activity of a-ketoamides using viral replicons and virus-infected cells Cells and viruses. Hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Huh7; ref. 58) and their derivative constitutively expressing T7 RNA polymerase (Huh-T7; ref. 59) were grown in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 100 U\u00b7mL -1 penicillin, 100 \u00b5g\u00b7mL -1 streptomycin sulfate, and fetal calf serum (10% in growth medium and 2% in maintenance medium). Huh-T7 cells were additionally supplemented with geneticin (G-418 sulfate, 400 \u00b5g\u00b7mL -1 ). Huh-T7 cells were used for the enteroviral replicons as well as for infection experiments with CVB3 strain Nancy.\n\nFor enterovirus (except CVB3) infection experiments, human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD; for EV-A71; BRCR strain) and HeLa Rh cells (for EV-D68 and human rhinoviruses) were grown in MEM Rega 3 medium supplemented with 1% sodium bicarbonate, 1% Lglutamine, and fetal calf serum (10% in growth medium and 2% in maintenance medium). For HCoV-229E (a kind gift from Volker Thiel (Bern, Switzerland)), culture and infection experiments were carried out as described. 60 For MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection experiments, Vero, Vero E6, and Huh7 cells were cultured as described previously. 61, 62 Infection of Vero and Huh7 cells with MERS-CoV (strain EMC/2012) and SARS-CoV infection of Vero E6 cells (strain Frankfurt-1) at low multiplicity of infection (MOI) were done as described before. 61, 63 All work with live MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV was performed inside biosafety cabinets in biosafety level-3 facilities at Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands. Viral replicons. The DNA-launched SARS-CoV replicon harbouring Renilla luciferase as reporter directly downstream of the SARS-CoV replicase polyprotein-coding sequence (pp1a, pp1ab, Urbani strain, acc. AY278741), in the context of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) under the control of the CMV promoter, has been described previously (pBAC-REP-RLuc). 33 Apart from the replicase polyprotein, the replicon encodes the following features: the 5'-and 3'-non-translated regions (NTR), a ribozyme (Rz), the bovine growth hormone sequence, and structural protein N.\n\nSubgenomic replicons of CVB3 (pT7-CVB3-FLuc 34 ) and EV-A71 (pT7-EV71-RLuc) harbouring T7-controlled complete viral genomes, in which the P1 capsid-coding sequence was replaced by the Firefly (Photinus pyralis) or Renilla (Renilla renifor) luciferase gene, were generously provided by F. van Kuppeveld and B. Zhang, respectively. To prepare CVB3 and EV-A71 replicon RNA transcripts, plasmid DNAs were linearized by digestion with SalI or HindIII (New England Biolabs), respectively. Copy RNA transcripts were synthesized in vitro using linearized DNA templates, T7 RNA polymerase, and the T7 RiboMax\u2122 Large-Scale RNA Production System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.\n\nTransfection. Huh-T7 cells grown in 12-well plates to a confluency of 80% -90% (2 -3 x 10 5 cells/well) were washed with 1 mL OptiMEM (Invitrogen) and transfected with 0.25 \u00b5g of the replication-competent replicon and Lipofectamin2000 or X-tremeGENE9 in 300 \u00b5l OptiMEM (final volume) as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen or Roche, respectively). The transfection mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 to 5 h (Lipofectamin2000) or overnight (X-tremeGENE9), prior to being replaced with growth medium containing the compound under investigation. For RNA-launched transfection of enteroviral replicons, DMRIE-C was used as transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). All experiments were done in triplicate or quadruplicate and the results are presented as mean values \u00b1 SD.\n\nTesting for inhibitory activity of candidate compounds. Initially, we performed a quick assessment of the inhibitory activity of the candidate compounds towards the enteroviral and coronaviral replicons at a concentration of 40 \u00b5M in Huh-T7 cells. Compounds that were relatively powerful and non-toxic at this concentration, were assayed in a dose-dependent manner to estimate their half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) as well as their cytotoxicity (CC50), as described. 29 In brief, different concentrations of a-ketoamides (40 \u00b5M in screening experiments or increasing concentration (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40 \u00b5M) when determining the EC50) were added to growth medium of replicon-transfected Huh-T7 cells. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were washed with 1 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS or OPTIMEM, Invitrogen) and lysed in 0.15 mL Passive lysis buffer (Promega) at room temperature (RT) for 10 min. After freezing (-80 o C) and thawing (RT), the cell debris was removed by centrifugation (16,000 x g, 1 min) and the supernatant (10 or 20 \u00b5l) was assayed for Firefly or Renilla luciferase activity (Promega or Biotrend Chemikalien) using an Anthos Lucy-3 luminescence plate reader (Anthos Microsystem).\n\nThe antiviral activity of the compounds was evaluated in a cytopathic effect (CPE) readout assay using MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3carboxymethoxyphenol)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, innersalt]-based assay. Briefly, 24 h prior to infection, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 2.5 x 10 4 (RD cells) or of 1.7 x 10 4 (HeLa Rh) per well in medium supplemented with 2% FCS. For HRV2 and HRV14 infection, the medium contained 30 mM MgCl2. The next day, serial dilutions of the compounds and virus inoculum were added. The read-out was performed 3 days post infection as follows: The medium was removed and 100 \u03bcl of 5% MTS in Phenol Red-free MEM was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, then the optical density at 498 nm (OD498) of each well was measured by microtiter plate reader (Saffire 2 , Tecan). The OD values were converted to percentage of controls and the EC50 was calculated by logarithmic interpolation as the concentration of compound that results in a 50% protective effect against virus-induced CPE. For each condition, cell morphology was also evaluated microscopically.\n\nAssays with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV were performed as previously described. 61, 63 In brief, Huh7, Vero, or Vero E6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 \u00d7 10 4 (Huh7 and Vero E6) or 2 \u00d7 10 4 cells (Vero) per well. After overnight growth, cells were treated with the indicated compound concentrations or DMSO (solvent control) and infected with an MOI of 0.005 (final volume 150 \u00b5l/well in Eagle's minimal essential medium (EMEM) containing 2% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics). Huh7 cells were incubated for two days and Vero/VeroE6 cells for three days, and differences in cell viability caused by virus-induced CPE or by compound-specific side effects were analyzed using the CellTiter 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance at 490 nm (A490) was measured using a Berthold Mithras LB 940 96-well plate reader (Berthold). Cytotoxic effects caused by compound treatment alone were monitored in parallel plates containing mock-infected cells. HCoV-229E-Rev: 5\u2032-ggTCGTTTAGTTGAGAAAAGT -3\u2032, and 229E-ZNA probe: 5'-6-Fam-AGA (pdC)TT(pdU)G(pdU)GT(pdC)TA(pdC)T-ZNA-3-BHQ-1 -3' (Metabion). Standard curves were prepared using serial dilutions of RNA isolated from virus stock. Data were analysed using GraphPad Prism 5.0; EC50 values were calculated based on a 4parameter logistic statistics equation. In parallel to the qPCR assays with inhibitors, cell viability assays were performed using Alamar-Blue\u2122 Cell Viability Reagent (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer's instruction. CC50 values were calculated using inhibitor versus normalized response statistics equation by including proper controls (no inhibitor and 1% Triton-X-100-treated cells).\n\nDetermination of the cell toxicity of candidate compounds. The CellTiter 96Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS test, Promega), the CellTiter Glo assay kit (Promega), the Non-Destructive Cytotoxicity Bio-Assay (ToxiLight (measuring the release of adenylate kinase from damaged cells), Lonza Rockland), or the AlamarBlue\u2122 Cell Viability Reagent (ThermoFisher) were used to determine the cytotoxic effect of compounds towards host cells according to the manufacturers' recommendations. 29, 65 Chemical synthesis of a-ketoamides General procedure. Reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without purification. HSGF 254 (0.15 -0.2 mm thickness) was used for analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC). All products were characterized by their NMR and MS spectra. 1 H NMR spectra were recorded on 300-MHz, 400-MHz, or 500-MHz instruments. Chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm, \u03b4) down-field from tetramethylsilane. Proton coupling patterns were described as singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), multiplet (m), and broad (br). Mass spectra were recorded using a Bruker ESI ion-trap HCT Ultra. HPLC spectra were recorded by LC20A or LC10A (Shimadzu Corporation) with Shim-pack GIST C18 (5 \u00b5m, 4.6x150mm) with three solvent systems (methanol/water, methanol/ 0.1% HCOOH in water or methanol/0.1% ammonia in water).
