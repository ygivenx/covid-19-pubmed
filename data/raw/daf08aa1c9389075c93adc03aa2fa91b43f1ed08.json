{"title": "Natural killer (NK) activity of porcine blood lymphocytes against allogeneic melanoma target cells", "body": "The occurrence of NK cell activity has been investigated in various organs and in the peripheral blaod of swine (Koren et al., 1978; Charley et al., 1983; Martin and Wardley, 1984; . Small to medium sized lymphocytes have been identified as NK-effector cells in contrast to the large granular lymphocytes of other species (Yang et al., 1987) . The NK cell population of swine is characterized as CD2 + CD8 + lymphocytes (Pescovitz et al., 1988; Saalmfiller et al., 1988) , but a specific NK cell marker is un-know~a for this species. Peripheral blood cells mediating SLA-unrestricted cytotoxicity were also found among the monocyte/granulocyte populations (Ohlinger and Saalmiiller, 1989 ) .\n\nThe spectrum of target cells and the reason for susceptibility in in vitro cytotoxicity assays for NK-CMC of swine are poorly understood. There is a single report on Yorkshire swine NK cell characteristics which analyses the susceptibility of xenogenei~ human a~id murine target cells. Taking the peripheral blood lymphocytes of Yorkshire swine as effector cells, murine YAC-l lymphoma cells were shown to be most susceptible to NK cell mediated lysis (Pinto and Fergusson, 1988 ) .\n\nThe K562 erythromyeloma tumor cells are the most commonly used targets for the demonstration of porcine NK-CMC in chromium release assays. However, there are some discrepancies concerning spleen NK cell activity against this cell line (Takamatsu and Koinde, 1985; Yang and Schultz, 1986) , which may be explained by variations in regulation of NK-CMC (Salmon et al., 1989) .\n\nVero cells (African green monkey kidney line) have also been shown to be susceptible to NK cell mediated lysis of swine lymphocytes (Wittmann and Ohlinger, 1987 ) , but are described as resistant to canine-CMC (Krakowka et al., 1988) . Berkelhammer et al. (1982) described leukocyte mediated cytotoxicity against allogeneic tumor cells in melanoma beating Sinclair miniature swine but without further characterization of the effector cell population. In the Munich Troll \u00ae miniature swine there is, similar to the Sinclair miniature swine, a high incidence of heritable melanomas (Wanke and Briiuer, 1986) . This situation led to the establishment oflong-term in vitro culture of homogenous melanoma cells derived from a cutaneous melanoma at necropsy. Significant incidence of spontaneous regression is observed in Sinclair swine (Oxenhandler et al., 1979 ) as well as in Munich Troll \u00ae swine cutaneous melanoma and metastasis with manifestation of tumors in internal organs is rare. This clinical situation makes the effects of cell-mediated immunity on melanoma tumor growth and regression an object of special interest (Beattie et al., 1988; Br/~cker et al., 1988) .\n\nIn this report the susceptibility of Troll \u00ae miniature swine melanoma cells to the lysis by spontaneous cytotoxic blood lymphocyte effector cells was compared with the lysis of xenogeneic target cells. Interferon production upon tumor cell contact and the influence of natural human interleukin-2 (nhuIL-2) on specific tumor cell lysis were determined.\n\nPeripheral blood cells of 15 female Munich Troll \u00ae miniature pigs (Sambraus, 1987) at an age of 4 days to 4 months, one boar (2 years old), and German Landraee sows (approximately 100 kg at slaughter) were used. The miniature swine were raised under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions at the Institute of Animal Pathology, University of Munich. Blood was collected from the cranial vena cava after anesthesia (Stresnil-Hypnodil, Janssen, Neuss) from Troll \u00ae pigs in which cutaneous melanoma were not detectable (neither at birth nor until the day of NK-CMC analysis). Three Troll \u00ae miniature swine, tested at an age of 4 or 16 weeks, had congenital cutaneous melanoma that showed progressive enlargement up to diameters of approximately 5 cm when the test for NK-CMC was performed (see Fig. 5 ). At the time the experiments were carried out, there were no signs of detrimental effects on the common health status. Blood samples of clinically healthy (n=6) and melanoma-bearing (n= 3 ) Troll \u00ae swines were taken on the same day and Nylon non-adherent lymphocytes were analysed for NK-CMC immediately after isolation in the same test. Blood samples from German Landrace pigs were taken immediately after slaughter during exsanguination at the aLV,I.~&.&VX, m,~Vlagl~l~l.liX \u2022\n\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated from whole blood by FicoU-Hypaque (Seromed, Berlin) gradient centrifugation (Boyum, 1976) , washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and adjusted to 10 s ceUs/ml in culture medium, RPMI 1640 (Seromed, Berlin ) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Seromed, Berlin ).\n\nRemoval ofplastic adherent cells. One hundred millilitres of a PBMC suspension ( 10 s cells in RPMI ) were poured into a culture flask ( 175 cm 2, Falcon, Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg), precoated with FCS, and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 (Kumagai et al., 1979) .\n\nNon-adherent cells were removed by gentle agitation of the culture medium, followed by three washings with RPMI and collected in plastic tubes for centrifugation.\n\nwere adjusted to 5 \u00d7 107/ml and carefully layered on a column of nylon fibers (Travenol Lab., Morton Grove, IL) according to the method of Julius et al. (1973) . After 1 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C the column was flushed with 25 ml of warm medium (37\u00b0C) to elute nylon-non-adherent cells. The eluted cells were centrifuged (300\u00d7g, 10 rain, 4\u00b0C) and resuspended in culture-medium. Cell viability, determined by the dye exclusion method, was higher than 90% in every experiment.\n\nTo demonstrate the nature of NK-CMC, nylon non-adherent lymphocytes (2.5 \u00d7 106 ) were treated with 20 or 40 mM concentrations of freshly prepared LeuOMe (Sigma, Deisenhofen) in 1 ml RPMI 1640 medium at 37\u00b0C for 30 rain (Shau and Golup, 1985 ) . The cells were then washed three times by centrifugation and used as effector cells in the chromium release assays.\n\nK562 human erythroleukemic cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC, CCL 243, Andersson et al., 1979) , U937, a human histiocytic lymphoma (ATCC CRL 1593, Sundstr~m and NiUson, 1976) and Raji Burkitt tymphoma cells (ATCC CCL 86, kindly supplied by Dr. Lipp, Institute of Biochemistry, Munich) were grown in suspension in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Vero (African green monkey) kidney cells (ATCC CCL 81 ) were cultivated in minimal essential medium (MEM, Biochrom, Berlin) supplemented with 3% FCS as monolayers in Roux glass bottles.\n\nThe PM/o~ Troll \u00ae miniature pig melanoma cells (European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, ECACC No. 89013101 ) were derived from a congenital cutaneous melanoma from a 7-week-old male piglet with massive melanomatous alterations of the internal organs found at autopsy. Homogeneous melanoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified MEM (D-MEM) with 10% FCS as adherent monolayers in plastic flasks ( 175 cm 2, Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg) and used as target cells at the 26 culture passage. All target cell lines were checked at regular intervals from mycoplasma contamination and were found to be free. Glass or plastic adherent target cells (Vero, PM/ 86) were detached from the surface using a mild trypsin (0.05%)/EDTA (0.025%) salt solution, centrifuged immediately and resuspended in medium before the labelling with sodium [5~Cr ]chromate.\n\nA 5~Cr-release microcytotoxicity technique was performed as described by Yang et al. (1987) . Target cells at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 106 were labelled with 100/~Ci Na25~CrO4 (Dupont NEN, Bad Homburg) for 1 h (37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 ). Labelled cells were washed three times with PBS and adjusted to 5 \u00d7 104 cells/ml with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS.\n\nNK cell activity to different target cells was determined by mixing nylon non-adherent lymphocytes with 51Cr-labelled target cells in the wells of round bottom microtiter plates (Greiner, Niirtingen) in a total volume of 0.2 ml. Four different effector to target cell ratios (E:T) 50, 25, 12.5 and 6:1 were assayed in triplicate in a 16 h incubation test.\n\nThe percentage cytotoxicity was calculated as follows:\n\nPercent cytotoxicity = mean c.p.m, experimental-mean c.p.m. SR X 100 mean c.p.m. MR-mean c.p.m. SR where SR (spontaneous release) is defined as the radioactivity released from target cells incubated in medium alone and MR (maximal release) as counts per rain (c.p.m.) in the supernatants of target cells lysed with TritonX 100. The c.p.m, of SR did not exceed 25% of the c.p.m, values of MR from any target cells used. Supernatant fluid (0. l ml) from each well was collected and radioactivity was determined in a gamma counter (Beckman Instruments, Munich). The percentage of specific lysis was calculated after data transfer (PC Ready Plus, Beckman Instruments, Munich) in a personal computer.\n\nFor cold target competition experiments unlabelled (cold) target cells were added to lymphocyte effector cells at E\" T ratios of 10\" 1 and 80: l and incubated as triplets in microplates (0.1 ml/well) for I h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator (5% CO2). Thereafter [ 5~Cr ] radiolabelled (hot) target cells (0. l m!) were added to achieve a ,,,~,~t~nt E: T ratio of 50\" !. Re~ult~ are pre.~antad as the specific lysis at an E\" T (hot targets) ratio of 50:1 in the presence of the two different amounts of cold target cells and compared with the lytic activity without adding cold target cells.\n\nNatural human interleukin-2 (nhuIL-2, Lymphocult-T-HP, Biotest, Frankfurt) dissolved in RPMI 1640 was added in the microtoxicity assay to effector/target mixtures at a concentration of 100 units U/ml. The percentage of specific target cell lysis from EL-2 treated and non-treated effector cells at an E: T ratio of 50:1 and 6: 1 were compared.\n\nEffector (2.5 X 106/ml nylon non-adherent lymphocytes) cells were incubated for 16 h (37\u00b0C, 5% CO2) together with non-radiolabelled target cells at an E:T of 50: l in a total volume of 2 ml RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS. At the end of incubation, cells were centrifuged for l0 min at 300 xg. The supernatants were collected and filtered through 0.22/zm filters (Sarto-flus, G/Sttingen). In some experiments the clarified supernatants were finally acidified with 1 N HCI to pH 2.5. The antiviral activity found was characterized as IFN activity according to current criteria (Lockart, 1973) and by neutralization with a specific antiserum containing 450 000 neutralizing units (NU) anti-human IFN-alpha and 3000 NU anti-human IFN-beta/ml (kindly provided by Prof. Cantell, Helsinki).\n\nIFN titers were determined on bovine MDBK cells (ATCC CCL 22 ) challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), strain Indiana as described (Rubinstein et al., 1981 ) . Twofold serial dilutions of supernatants (50/d) were made by dilution of the samples in MEM in 96-well mierotiter plates (Nunclon, Nunc, Wiesbaden ).\n\nOn each plate, four wells were filled with 50/d of medium to serve as virusor cell-controls. Each well was then seeded with 5 \u00d7 104 MDBK cells in 50/d MEM supplemented with 2% FCS. After 6 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C the monolayers were challenged with 50-80 plaque-forming units per well of VSV. By the time the virus control cell sheet showed complete destruction, the highest protective dilutions were scored.\n\nSince there is no porcine standard IFN available all titers were expressed in human units by including a laboratory standard IFN in each independent assay. This recombinant standard IFN-alpha (Boehringer, Vienna) had a mean titer of 1200 international units (IU) /ml when assayed in MDBK cells against the international reference alpha2-IFN Gxa01-901-535 (National Institute of Health, U.S.A.)\n\nThe 50% endpoints were determined by visual examination after staining the monolayers with crystal ,-iolet (Merck, Darmstadt).\n\nResults were expressed as means_+ standard deviation (s.d.), and statistical significance was analysed by Student's t-test (unpaired or paired as appropriate). P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.\n\nAllogeneic PM/86 melanoma cells showed reduced susceptibility to lysis by peripheral blood lymphoeytes of both, German Landrace and Munich Troll ~ miniature swine, compared with the NK activity against the xenogeneic target cells U937, K562 and Vero. In Fig. I the susceptibility of the target cells to NK-CMC of peripheral blood lymphocytes from German Landrace and Munich Troll \u00ae miniature swine is expressed in percent of specific lysis at E: T ratios of 50:1 and 6: 1.\n\nThe kinetics of NK activity by Troll \u00ae miniature swine peripheral blood lymphocytes are similar for K562 and PM/86 target cells, but the values of specific lysis of allogeneic melanoma cells are significantly (P<0.05) lower (Fig. 2) (Fig. 1 ) .\n\nNylon non-adherent lymphocytes of Troll \u00ae miniature swine were able to lyse K562 and melanoma target cells when blood samples of animals older than 2 weeks are taken as the source of the effector cells. Almost no NK cell activity could be seen with lymphocytes from animals younger than I week of age (data not shown). A significantly (P<0.05) lower cytotoxicity against PM/86 melanoma cells compared with K562 lysis was detected at all E:T ratios tested, when the lymphocytes of adult animals were taken as effector cells, regardless of the race in the blood donor (Fig. 3) . In Troll \u00ae miniature swine the grade of melanoma target cell lysis was not significantly different between clinically healthy animals and three animals bearing cutaneous melanoma (Figs. 4 and 5 ). \n\nAs expected, the NK-CMC resistant Raji cells are the weakest competitors in chromium release tests with radJolabelled U937, K562 and PM/86 target cells. The allogeneic PM/86 melanoma cells are strong inhibitors of NK-CMC when K562 or U937 radiolabelled target cells were used, but the hindrance of U937 specific tumor cell lysis is about 30% less than that ofK562 cells.\n\nThe use of K562 and U937 cold target cells as competitors in cytotoxicity experiments with (5~Cr) labelled cells of the different tumor line resulted in a slightly stronger inhibition of K562 lysis by U937 cells than vice versa ( Table 1 ) .\n\nA moderate dose ( 100 U/2.5 \u00d7 106 lymphocytes) of nhuIL-2, added to eflector/target cell mixtures during the NK-CMC test time ( 16 h) enhanced the specific lysis of xenogeneic K562-and U937 tumor cells significantly (P<0.05). This effect was more pronounced at the low E: T ratio of 6:1 ( Table 2 ). The addition of nhulL-2 to assays of lymphocyte cytotoxicity against PM/86 melanoma target cells also resulted in higher rates of specific lysis. The NK cell stimulation with nhulL-2 in the allogeneic system too, was more clearly visible at the low E:T ratio of 6:1 ( Table 2 ). The relative percentage of NK-CMC enhancement is comparable with that obtained in the assays with xenogeneic tumor cells as the targets.\n\nMany tumor cell lines, including melanoma, are able to induce interferon on contact with human lymphocytes (Tdnchiefi et al., 1977) . After incuba-tion of po-rine nylon non-adherent lymphocytes with K562 myeloma cells high levels ~.fVSV antiviral activity were found in cell-free supernatants (Table 3). Because of its stability at pH 2.0 and its neutralization with an anti-IFN-alpha serum ( 1 NU of serum neutralized 4 IU porcine IFN) the antivira!! activity in the supernatants is characterized as IFN-alpha (Lockart, 1973) .\n\nThe contact of lymphocytes from Landrace swine with PM/86 melanoma cells did not lead to detectable IFN activity in the supernatants of lymphocyte/target mixtures. IFN titers, higher than 20 IU/ml could not be measured ( Table 3) . Incubation of Troll \u00ae miniature swine blood lymphocytes together with PM/86 melanoma cells did not initiate the release of WN-alpha titers greater than 20 IU/ml. Neither the cocultivation with Raji lymphoma cells nor the incubation in medium alone stimulated the release of IFN, detectable in the VSV antiviral assay with MDBK cells. For the two inductive tumor cell lines K562 and U937 the kinetics of IFN production were similar (data not shown). IFN detection in supernatants was possible about 4 h after the tumor cells were added to porcine lymphocytes. The IFN titers increased steadily until reaching a plateau between 16 and 24 h of incubation. Thereafter the titers did not change even when incubation was continued up to 72 h. DISCUSSION NK cell activity mediated by porcine blood lymphocytes exhibits characteristics distinct from effector cell activity in man and rodents. Not only the morphology and tissue distribution of NK cells but also the kinetics of tumor al., 1987) .\n\nThe aim of this study was to compare the susceptibility of an allogeneic and four xenogeneic tumor cell lines to NK cell lysis mediated by peripheral blood lymphocytes of Troll \u00ae miniature and German Landrace swine. A possible role of self-regulatory cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN had to be watched in this system since a stimulatory effect of exogenous IFN-alpha and IL-2 is well known Bhagyam et al., 1988; Lesnick and Derbyshire, 1988 ). In the human system different melanoma cell lines have been shown to be very heterogeneous concerning their capacity to induce IFN when cocultivated with lymphocytes (Trinchieri et al., 1977) .\n\nThe generation of IFN-alpha after contact of porcine blood lymphocytes with the melanom~ cells failed or yielded non-detectable low titers, whereas highly susceptibl.e xenogeneic target cells regularly induced high titers of IFN. The induction of high IFN titers ( > 160 IU/ml) on target/effector cell contact at an E:T of 50:1 seems to be a signal concerning the susceptibility of tumor cells for porcine NK-CMC, however, IFN induction by tumor cells might not be a reliable qualitative parameter since the NK cell mediated lysis of U937 was more effective than K562 tumor cell lysis even the IFN titers after K562 cell contact were always the highest.\n\nThe presence of other cytotoxic cytokines such as perforin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or natural killer cell cytotoxic factor (NKCF) may play the crucial role in target cell destruction by swine lymphocytes as described for human NK-CMC (Carpen and Saksela, 1988 ) . Synergistic effects with IFN are likely, because, for example human alpha, beta and gamma IFNs, are modulators of IL-2 production (Rosztoczy et al., 1986) . Indirect enhancement oftumor cell lysis via NK cell activation by IL-2 and/or IFN is also well established in the porcine system Charley and Fradelizi, 1987; t,esnick and Derbyshire, 1988) .\n\nIn our experiments we found, that in a 16 h 51Cr release assay a moderate dose of natural human IL-2 is sufficient for the stimulation of NK blood lymphocytes of older ( > 1 week) Troll \u00ae miniature and German Landrace swine to kill susceptible target cells more efficiently. The addition of natural human IL-2 at a dose of 100 U/ml during the test time resulted in about the same enhancement of NK-CMC regardless of whether xenogeneic or aUogeneic target cells were used. These findings indicate that NK-CMC under the influence of IL-2 might compensate for the diminished susceptibility of PM/86 melanoma cells.\n\nAs the cold target competition assays revealed, allogeneic PM/86 melanoma cells strongly interact with NK effector cells, but are lysed to a lower degree than the xenogeneic tumor cells. This observation is not restricted to Troll \u00ae miniature swine blood donors with melanoma inheritance; it is equally seen with blood lymphocytes from German Landrace swine. It might be caused totoxic or stimulatory cytokines as already suggested by Pinto and Fergusson ( 1988 ) . Structures mediating the recognition of tumor target cells by NK cells are yet unknown but their function is thought to be distinct from that triggering the cytolytic process (Targan and Newman, i 983; Chervenak and Wolcott, 1988 ). This has previously been shown in studies on the mechanisms of defective NK cell activity in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Bonavida et al., 1986; Sirianni et al., 1988 ) . Low NK cell activity has also been described by Hersey et al. (1979) in familial melanoma patients and their relatives. The assessment of peripheral blood NK cell activity in tumor patients as a diagnostic or prognostic parameter suffers from many imponderabilities (Pross, 1986) .\n\nThere was no significantly higher NK cell activity observed, mediated by lympaocy,es of Troll \u00ae miniature swine, neither bearing melanoma congenitally, nor having developed melanoma during the time after birth, when compared with the blood lymphocyte cytotoxic activity of three animals affected by cutaneous melanoma (Figs. 4 and 5 ) . This is contrary to recent findings by Richerson and Misfeldt (1989) in Sinclair swine, where in vitro NK-CMC is suggested to correlate with stages of tumor progression or regression.\n\nThe observation of\"normal NK-CMC\" mediated by blood lymphocytes of melanoma-bearing Troll* miniature swine older than 4 weeks of age has to be proven by determination of NK-CMC from a higher number of animals where no tumor regression occurred. Nevertheless NK-CMC against the allogeneic melanoma cells again is also significantly (P< 0.01 ) reduced in the melanoma diseased animals iflymphocyte mediated lysis ofK562 tumor cells is taken as the reference system for the detection of porcine NK cell activity. The role of blood NK cell activity for melanoma regression in the Munich Troll* miniature swine might be of lesser importance compared with the defense mechanisms at the site of tumor growth. Experiments for the characterization and determination of functional properties of tumor infiltrating leukocytes may provide more information about the role of NK cells."}
