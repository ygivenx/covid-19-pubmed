{"title": "Prodrug defiance reveals logic-based strategies for treating bacterial resistance", "body": "The rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria coupled with the lack of newly developed antibiotics has created a serious public health threat 1, 2 . Understanding the causes of antibiotic failure inspires the development of new drugs and informs clinical treatment strategies [3] [4] [5] . These failure mechanisms are broadly classified into three distinct categories (i.e., resistance, 5 persistence, and tolerance), which are characterized by the change in drug concentration and exposure time required to kill bacteria 6 . For example, resistance is characterized by genetic mutations or phenotypic changes which result in bacteria requiring significantly higher concentrations of antibiotic (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC) to be lethal. By contrast, bacteria exhibiting tolerance or persistence require increased drug exposure time (minimum 10 duration for killing, MDK), with the latter exhibiting a biphasic killing profile (Fig. 1A) . Further, bacteria populations become tolerant through environmental conditions or genetic mutations, whereas persistence is an actively maintained, non-heritable state exhibited by a subpopulation of bacteria. Discriminating between these survival strategies employed by bacteria is crucial for the development of new drugs and clinical treatment decisions 6 . 15\n\nAntibiotic success is markedly improved by proper titration of drugs, as overdosing leads to off-target toxicity and underdosing increases the likelihood of pathogens developing resistance 7 . However, optimal drug doses are difficult to achieve over the course of treatment because infection burden changes dynamically over time, creating a moving target 7, 8 . Prodrugs, which represent ~10% of all FDA-approved drugs in the last decade, are a promising solution 20 because they may be automatically titrated by a disease-related activation mechanism, increase bioavailability, and reduce the risk of off-target effects 9 . For example, prodrugs such as ganciclovir 10 and isoniazid 11 are administered as biologically inactive forms and are enzymatically activated by the pathogen. Here, we use prototypic auto-titrating prodrugs comprising cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMP), which evolved as a part of innate immunity and display broad-25 spectrum and prokaryote-specific antimicrobial activity 12 . Cationic AMPs act by disrupting bacterial membranes and inducing inflammatory responses 13 , but suffer from off-target toxicity and low stability in vivo 14, 15 . Our AMP prodrugs are activated directly by bacterial proteases, which are a major cause of virulence [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] during infections and important targets for antibiotic development 22 . Of these proteases, outer membrane protease T (OmpT) is a membrane-bound 5 bacterial protein that is widely conserved across gram-negative bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family and recognizes a variety of targets that contribute to its virulence (e.g., plasminogen) 18, 19, [23] [24] [25] . In this work, we design cationic AMPs that are locked by charge complexation with anionic peptides and connected with a protease-cleavable linker substrate [26] [27] [28] that is recognized by E. coli protease OmpT, such that increasing concentrations of bacteria 10 activate higher concentrations of free drug.\n\nWhile AMP prodrugs eliminate the majority of bacteria, we observe bacteria populations exhibiting a phenotype we named \"defiant\", proliferating in the presence of active drug by consistently outpacing prodrug activation at all stages of growth (i.e., log phase, stationary phase).\n\nTo understand the mechanism by which bacteria become resistant to AMP prodrugs, we built a 15 system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODE) that model the dynamics of the bacteriaprodrug competition. We use this model to identify a dimensionless quantitythe Bacterial Advantage Heuristic (B.A.H.)which predicts with perfect accuracy whether bacteria will become defiant under a broad range of environmental conditions. At low BAH values, bacteria are susceptible to elimination, but beyond a critical BAH threshold, the bacteria switch to a state of 20 defiance, in which the bacteria proliferate in the presence of activated drug. To combat prodrug failure due to defiance, we design biological circuits that eliminate bacteria under all conditions (BAH values) by recognizing that AMP prodrugs behave analogously to transistors: above a critical BAH threshold (i.e., gate voltage), bacteria (i.e., input current) pass through the prodrug and exhibit defiance. We use this framework to build logic gates with prodrug transistors, which 25 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/556951 doi: bioRxiv preprint we use to construct a multi-prodrug circuit that outputs 0 (i.e., dead bacteria) under all eight combinations of three input BAH values. These quantitative mechanistic insights will inform future drug design and treatment protocols to combat antibiotic resistance.\n\nTo construct bacteria-activated prodrugs, we synthesized cationic (polyarginine) AMPs in charge complexation with anionic peptide locks (polyglutamic acid) by a linker peptide (RRS|RRV) specific for the ubiquitous bacterial protease OmpT 26 . Upon proteolytic cleavage of the linker, the hairpin prodrug is unlocked to release free AMP, creating a mechanism for auto-titration (Fig. 1B) . 10\n\nTo demonstrate linker specificity for OmpT, we synthesized an activity probe 24, 29-33 with free linker peptides containing a fluorophore-quencher pair and detected OmpT activity in samples incubated with recombinant OmpT or live E. coli culture. Conversely, we observed no activity in samples containing the serine protease inhibitor, Aprotinin, which inhibits OmpT when present in micromolar concentrations 23 (Fig. 1C) . We observed similar cleavage activity using this linker 15 substrate when fully integrated into hairpin AMP drug-lock complexes, confirming that linker presentation within a constrained conformational state did not affect cleavage activity by OmpT (Fig. 1D) . To measure cytotoxicity of unlocked drug, we dosed bacteria with free AMP and observed significant reduction in colonies compared to untreated controls (blue bars) (Fig. 1E,   F ). To confirm prodrug specificity, we synthesized AMP drug-lock complexes using linker peptides 20 specific for OmpT or Tobacco Etch Virus Protease (TEV), which exhibits orthogonal protease specificity 34 . We observed elimination of bacteria only in samples containing OmpT-specific AMP prodrugs (grey bars) or samples treated with both TEV and TEV-specific AMP prodrugs (red bars).\n\nAll control samples containing either TEV-specific prodrug alone or Aprotinin inhibitor did not 6 significantly reduce bacteria load (Fig. 1E, F, Table S1 ). Our results showed that AMP drug-lock complexes are inert and lack cytotoxic activity until activation by protease activity.

In our system, the three dynamic populations are the Bacteria, B, the Locked drug, L, and the Unlocked drug, U, for which we formulated governing ODEs by considering the system parameters that affect populational change over time. For this prodrug system, increased E. coli growth results in increased proteolytic activation of AMP, which in turn lyses bacteria to 20 create a negative feedback loop. Therefore, we modeled the bacteria population B as increasing (i.e., green dashed arrows) the rate of enzymatic drug conversion (i.e., L to U) and the unlocked drug population U as increasing the rate of bacterial death (Fig 2A) . To account for the fact that bacterial growth rate, r, slows down as environmental resources become limiting (i.e., carrying capacity, Bmax), we used a logistic growth model 35 , which produces an S-shaped curve and has 25 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/556951 doi: bioRxiv preprint been used extensively in biology to study population expansion 36 and tumor growth 37 Here we assumed our system constituted a well-mixed solution of freely diffusing substrates (i.e., locked drug) in large excess, which were valid assumptions for this study since AMP prodrug was present 10 at concentrations ~10 2 micromolar in an aqueous environment. Because the total amount of drug is conserved, we defined the MM activation rate of unlocked drug, U, as opposite of the degradation rate of locked drug L (Equation 1.3) . We further included a term to account for the loss of active AMPs according to a proportionality constant, a * , that represents the number AMP required to kill one E. coli. This term was necessary as AMPs lyse E. coli by intercalating with 15 bacterial membranes 39 and therefore are removed from the system and unable to target additional bacteria.\n\nTo fit this model to our system, we measured the values for relevant parameters, including 20 enzymatic efficiency (e.g., kcat, Km), bacterial growth (e.g., r, Bmax), and prodrug activity (e.g., a, . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/556951 doi: bioRxiv preprint a * ) (Fig. S1 , Table S2 ). This allowed us to predict bacteria-prodrug response curves (red and blue dashed lines; Fig. 2B ) across nine distinct combinations of kcat and r values, which we experimentally controlled by altering the ambient temperature and concentration of broth (conditions labeled A1-3, B1-3, and C1-3; Table S3 ). Strikingly, our model anticipated a binary bacterial response to prodrug treatment that would be evident within 24 hours; bacteria were 5 predicted to be either susceptible to the prodrug and die (red dashed lines) or to exhibit a druginvariant phenotype and proliferate to saturating levels (blue dashed lines) (Fig. 2B, C) . To experimentally validate our model predictions, we incubated bacteria with prodrugs under the defined nine conditions, and quantified the number of living bacteria longitudinally over the course of a 24 hour treatment window. Quantified bacterial counts taken during the course of treatment 10 as well as at endpoint closely matched the values predicted by our model (R 2 = 0.84, red and blue dots; Fig. 2B , C) and likewise revealed a binary bacterial response to prodrugs leading to antibiotic failure. We therefore called this form of resistance to prodrugs as bacterial \"defiance.\"\n\nCollectively, these experiments demonstrate that when E. coli are exposed to the AMP prodrug, our model can be used to predict bacterial growth kinetics, which ultimately result in a binary 15 outcome.\n\n.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/556951 doi: bioRxiv preprint Schematic depicting that bacterial defiance is characterized by proliferation in the presence of activated drug.\n\nHaving demonstrated that bacteria exposed to a prodrug exhibit a binary outcomesusceptibility (i.e., death) or defiance (i.e., survival)we next sought to determine whether the behavior could be quantified by a metric of resistance that could be generalized across broad treatment conditions. Based on our model and experimental validation, we observed that under defiance, 15 populations of live bacteria expanded (i.e., positive growth rate) throughout the course of treatment, which implied that key bacterial growth parameters (e.g., r, Bmax) were greater in value than enzyme-driven death rate parameters (e.g., kcat, Km) (Fig. 2B, 3A) . Therefore, to derive a metric to discriminate between defiant and susceptible bacteria, we used Buckingham Pi theorem to identify a dimensionless quantity that represents the competing balance between growth rate 20 and enzymatic turnover, which we defined as the Bacterial Advantage Heuristic The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/556951 doi: bioRxiv preprint This quantity reflects that bacteria have a higher probability of switching to the defiance phenotype under conditions that promote a faster growth rate, r, and slower enzymatic activity, kcat. To predict the onset of the defiance phenotype, we sought to determine the critical B.A.H. value that distinguishes defiant bacteria from susceptible populations. Using our mathematical model, we simulated >2000 prodrug treatment conditions covering a range of values for r, Bmax, kcat, and Km 5 and identified a critical value of BAH at which bacteria switch from susceptibility to defiance (BAHcrit ~ -11.37) (Fig. 3B) . In other words, for any environmental or genetic condition that produces a BAH > BAHcrit, the bacteria will survive the prodrug treatment, and for BAH < BAHcrit, the bacteria will die. To test the robustness of this switch-like behavior, we modeled treatment outcomes by varying bacterial growth rates (r) and enzymatic efficiencies (kcat) (> 100 points) and 10 found that BAHcrit was time-independent across a range of prodrug treatment durations. (Fig 3C-E) . Additionally, to demonstrate that BAHcrit is independent from any system parameter, we modeled treatment outcomes (> 500 points) by individually fixing each of the four parameters (i.e., r, Bmax, kcat, and Km) in turn and found that BAHcrit was invariant across all conditions tested (Fig   3F-I) . To confirm the value of BAHcrit experimentally, we first used the nine experimental 15 conditions previously tested (A1-3, B1-3, C1-3) to fit the values for kcat and r (Fig S2) , and then used the computationally-derived critical BAH threshold to classify the phenotype of nine bacteriaprodrug treatment conditions. By receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis, BAHcrit perfectly predicted the onset of defiance (Fig. 3J ,K AUROC = 1.00, n = 9) with 100% specificity and sensitivity. Our model results predicted that changing key system parameters to decrease 20 the B.A.H. below the critical threshold will result in successful treatment of defiant bacteria. To demonstrate this, we took three different AMP prodrugs with distinct linker sequences (Table S1) with increasing kcat values for OmpT to decrease the B.A.H. below BAHcrit, which allowed us to successfully treat previously defiant populations of bacteria (Fig. S3) . These findings are important for the successful design and administration of prodrug therapies, which may be 25 improved by optimizing fundamental pharmacokinetic parameters.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/556951 doi: bioRxiv preprint \n\nOur model revealed that bacterial defiance arises during prodrug monotherapy when 5 environmental parameters, as represented by a dimensionless constant, crosses a critical transition BAH value. To combat bacterial defiance, we therefore sought to design a multi-prodrug approach to eliminate defiant bacteria that would otherwise resist treatment to a single prodrug (Fig. 4A) . To do this, we recognized that the bacterial switch from susceptibility to defiance could be considered as behaving analogously to electronic transistorstransistors allow input current 10 (Iin) to pass (Iout) when the gate voltage (G) crosses a threshold, whereas with AMP prodrugs, input bacteria (Bin) survive treatment (Bout) when the BAH (gate) crosses a critical value (Fig. 4B) .\n\nUnder this analogy, we postulated that multiple prodrug biological transistors could be used to construct logical operations (i.e., AND, OR, NOT gates) that allow for the design of integrated biological circuits that output state \"0\" (i.e., bacterial death) for all possible inputs. These biological 15 circuits would then be representative of a multi-prodrug strategy to eliminate bacteria even when input BAH variables (i.e., temperature, nutrient level, enzyme activity) would result in a state of defiance for a single prodrug. To accomplish this, we designed complementary N-type and P-type transistors, which are required to construct all possible logic gates 40 . N-type transistors allow input current to pass when the gate signal is above a defined threshold, whereas P-type transistors 20 allow current to pass when the gate signal is below a defined threshold. We constructed N-type transistors with our AMP prodrug system, which allowed input bacteria (Bin = 1) to survive (Bout = 1) when the BAH is above BAHcrit which we used to define the gate threshold (i.e., BAH > BAHcrit equivalent to G = 1; BAH < BAHcrit equivalent to G = 0) (Fig. 4B) . To create P-type transistors, we synthesized heat-triggered liposomes 41 (Fig. S4) loaded with the antibiotic ampicillin 42 , which was 25 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/556951 doi: bioRxiv preprint released at temperatures above 37 o C to kill bacteria (i.e., Bout = 0) (Fig. 4C) . Above this critical temperature, treatment with AMP prodrugs leads to bacterial defiance (i.e., BAH > BAHcrit or G = 1) and E. coli survive prodrug treatment by proliferating significantly faster than prodrug activation 43 . We therefore defined temperatures above 37 o C as corresponding to G = 1 and below as G = 0 for our P-type biological transistor to match inverse gate values for our N-type biological 5\n\ntransistor. These results demonstrated that antimicrobial drugs could be modeled with similar input and output characteristics compared to N-type and P-type transistors. heat-triggered, drug-loaded liposomes allow the input bacteria (Bin) to survive (Bout = 1) when the gate signal (G) is low (i.e., G = 0 when temperature < Tcrit). All truth tables depict binary inputoutput combinations.\n\nTo demonstrate the use of multiple prodrug transistors in biological circuits capable of killing defiant bacteria, we selected three variables (i.e., bacterial nutrients, temperature, linker 15 substrate kcat) that independently influence bacteria-prodrug competition to act as circuit inputs (i.e., A, B, and C respectively). For each circuit input, we assigned the value 0 or 1 by fixing all other variables and choosing one condition that enabled bacterial survival (i.e., IN = 1 when BAH > BAHcrit) and one condition that resulted in bacterial death (i.e., IN = 0 when BAH < BAHcrit). We then designed a biological circuit to kill bacteria (i.e., OUT = 0) under all eight combinations of 20 nutrient (LB Broth = 0% or 2%), temperature (T = 30 o C or 37 o C), and linker substrate (kcat = 7 x 10 7 s -1 or 2 x 10 6 s -1 ) conditions while using three AND gates and one NOT gate (Fig 4A) .\n\nElectronic AND gates are created by placing two transistors in series; similarly, we sequentially dosed bacteria with two prodrugs, each with corresponding BAH values to represent the gate inputs (i.e., A and B). We controlled the corresponding BAH value for each prodrug with the linker 25 .

When exposed to all four possible inputs, bacteria only survived the condition with two low kcat prodrugs (i.e., AB = 11), which matched the ideal outputs of an AND gate (Fig. 5B) . These results show that dosing multiple prodrugs in sequence reduces the fraction of bacterial populations that survive (e.g., one 5 prodrug = 50% survival, two prodrugs = 25% survival, etc.). Whereas the AND gate comprised prodrugs in series, we demonstrated one implementation of an OR gate by splitting a population of bacteria in half (i.e., separate wells), dosing each with a different prodrug during the same time interval (i.e., in parallel) and recombining the bacteria post-treatment. Using this circuit, bacteria survived in any case where at least one half of the population was dosed with low kcat prodrug 10 (i.e., AB = 01, 10, or 11), matching the ideal outputs of an OR gate (Fig. 5C) . We created a NOT gate by using a P-type transistor comprising ampicillin-loaded heat-triggered liposomes, which caused bacteria to die at high temperatures (i.e., IN = 1) and survive at low temperatures (i.e., IN = 0). (Fig. 5D) . These results show that heat-triggered liposomes can be used as a fail-safe to kill bacteria above the critical temperature representing the onset of the defiance phenotype. To 15 validate the multi-prodrug circuit, we incubated populations of bacteria under each of the eight environmental conditions with three prodrugs: (1) an AMP prodrug with fixed kcat/Km, (2) an AMP prodrug with kcat/Km determined by input C, and (3) a heat-triggered, drug-loaded liposome (Fig.   4A) . Whereas a single prodrug only eliminated bacteria in half of the input cases (Fig. 5E) , our circuit autonomously eliminated bacteria under all eight combinations of the three environmental 20 signals (Fig. 5F) . These results demonstrate that by utilizing the transistor-like properties of prodrugs, we can design and administer biocircuits that combat bacterial defiance.

In this work, we identified a prodrug-specific subclass of resistance, which we named defiance. To study bacterial defiance, we synthesized an AMP prodrug that was activated by bacterial protease activity and successfully 10 killed E. coli. However, we found that this prodrug failed in conditions where the bacteria grew faster than the rate at which they activated the drug. We developed a mathematical model of the bacteria-prodrug competition and derived a dimensionless constant (BAH), which we used to perfectly predict the onset of the defiance phenotype. These studies revealed that both environmental (e.g., temperature, available nutrients) and pharmacokinetic (e.g., activation rate 15 kcat) parameters can be tuned to engineer successful prodrug therapies. In future work, this information could be leveraged to improve the efficacy of existing prodrugs by tuning the prodrug decay constant (i.e., biological half-life), which directly changes the BAHcrit value. Alternatively, the catalytic efficiency of the prodrug substrate could be tuned to change the BAH value and increase the probability of success, which has been previously demonstrated by engineering 20 prodrug substrates with higher affinity for the enzymatic target 44, 45 .\n\nIn our study, insights into bacterial defiance were elucidated in the context of AMP prodrugs that activate by an extracellular mechanism of action. We anticipate that this phenomenon of defiance also extends to prodrugs that are intracellularly activated, which .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/556951 doi: bioRxiv preprint represent the second major category of prodrugs 46 . To account for intracellular activation, our model would include a transport rate term to account for prodrug diffusion across cell membranes 47 . The implications of our model will likely still hold if prodrug transport is not the rate limiting step (i.e., represents a separate mechanism by which bacteria can escape treatment) and is greater than the rate of prodrug activation. This is a reasonable assumption given that the rates of drug 5 diffusion across membranes 48, 49 are on the order 10 10 -10 17 -fold higher than the typical range of prodrug activation rates 50, 51 .\n\nBy comparison to established forms of resistance, prodrug defiance could occur from either genetic or phenotypic changes. For example, both phenotypic resistance (i.e., non-inherited resistance) and tolerance are acquired under specific conditions that affect growth rate, such as 10 in biofilms 6, 52 . By contrast, inherited resistance arises from genetic mutations that alter key bacterial processes including metabolism, enzymatic activity, and drug efflux pumps 53 . In our studies, we demonstrated that environmental conditions (i.e., temperature, nutrient levels) affect the defiance phenotype; however, it is also likely that the onset of defiance could also arise from genetic mutations that affect E. coli growth rates or cleavage activity or proteases [54] [55] [56] . Our findings 15\n\nsuggest that prodrugs currently used in the clinic may fail due to the onset of bacterial defiance.\n\nFor example, the nitroimidazole class of antibiotics (e.g., metronidazole, dimetridazole, tinidazole, etc.), which is used to treat anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Enterococcus species, Clostridium species, Helicobacter pylori, etc.) represent prodrugs that are activated by bacterial reductases 57 . Genetic studies have revealed that bacterial resistance to nitroimidazole antibiotics is caused by either 20 partial or complete reduction in expression of genes (e.g., rdxA, frxA, etc.) encoding the reductases that activate the prodrug [58] [59] [60] . These changes in the activating enzyme would decrease the rate of prodrug activation, thereby resulting in a reduced overall BAH, that if below BAHcrit for the system, would result in defiance.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/556951 doi: bioRxiv preprint As bacteria-activated prodrugs are an emerging strategy to treat antibiotic resistant infections 9 , our work may provide strategies for preventing defiance-related resistance mechanisms in new and existing prodrugs. To propose strategies for treating prodrug defiance, we leveraged the transistor-like behavior of prodrugs to design a multi-drug circuit to eliminate defiant bacteria that would normally survive the treatment of a single prodrug. In these 5 experiments, we tested eight discrete combinations of three variables (e.g., nutrients, temperature, and linker substrate) and showed that the multi-drug logic circuit effectively eliminated bacteria in all eight conditions. In future work, different variables (e.g., O2, pH, relative biodistribution, etc.) could be included to increase the range of possible treatment conditions. This would require a quantitative understanding of the relationship between the variable and how it 10\n\naffects key components of the BAH (i.e., r or kcat). Ideally, these variables will proportionally influence either the growth rate or the enzymatic activity of the bacteria, such as how increasing substrate efficiency increases kcat, which creates one critical value (BAHcrit). By contrast, variables that influence growth rate or enzyme activity with multiple critical values (i.e., inflection points) limit the range of applicability. For example, higher temperatures increase both growth rate and 15 enzymatic activity, but above critical temperatures, protein enzymes denature, resulting in irreversible loss of activity 61 . However, these values are beyond relevant biological values and do not limit the applicability of these prodrug treatments to normal physiological conditions.\n\nHere, we quantitatively studied the mechanism of prodrug defiance and revealed logicbased strategies for successfully treating bacteria. We envision that this body of work will motivate 20 the development of new prodrugs and improve the clinical administration of existing prodrugs, ultimately helping to reduce the burden of antibiotic failure.\n\n.

To calculate bacterial growth rate constants, we incubated bacteria in broth or water at 37 o C and measured OD600 over the course of 8 hours, revealing a higher growth rate in broth consistent with published values 35, 56 (3.0 > 0.1 h -1 ) (Fig. S1B) . To quantify enzymatic velocity, we measured proteolytic velocity (moles L -1 s -1 ) under substrate concentrations ranging from 0-200 uM and fit the Michaelis-Menten equations 10 to this data to calculate kcat and Km (Fig. S1C ). Using these measured parameters (Table S2) , we generated kinetic curves for bacteria number and drug concentration over time. The model showed that after a period of initial bacterial growth, the lagging drug population eliminated the infection burden. While the initial reservoir of locked drug concentration was ~200 \u00b5M, the unlocked drug never rose above 5 \u00b5M (Fig. S1D) , revealing that this system maintains the minimal 15 drug concentration required to kill the infection.

In this model, the prodrug is substituted with a fluorescent probe (P), which is activated with the same substrate sequence as the AMP prodrug. To simplify the model, we defined one bacterium, with ~ 2.5 \u00d7 10 3 OmpT proteases per 5 cell 62 , as equivalent to one effective enzyme. The concentration of cleaved fluorescent probe is monitored over time, and the bacterial concentration is quantified at serial time points. We fit this data to the two equations modelling bacterial growth and activation of the fluorescent probe (Equations S1.1, S1.2).
