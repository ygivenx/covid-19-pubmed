{"title": "Human Rhinovirus C Infections in Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Patients", "body": "Acute respiratory infections (ARI) in childhood cause significant morbidity and mortality (1) . Compared to the immunocompetent host, children undergoing myelosuppressive therapy, as well as those who receive hematopoieitic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), are at higher risk for severe disease with common viral infections due to immune compromise (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of ARI; other major viruses are influenza, human metapneumovirus (MPV), human rhinoviruses (HRV), and parainfluenzaviruses (PIV) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . Recent studies have identified a new species of HRV called HRVC (17) (18) (19) (20) . These novel HRV are associated with wheezing and asthma (15, 21) , but their role in immuncompromised children is not clear. We sought to define viral etiology, including HRV, and identify risk factors for respiratory virus infection among a pediatric hematology-oncology and HSCT patient population and describe associated disease manifestations.\n\nThis study is based on convenience samples collected from the population of interest. Recruitment began in December 2003 and subjects were enrolled during two winter seasons (between December and March) until December 2005. Children evaluated as inpatients and outpatients in the Hematology-Oncology department for any underlying hematologyoncology problem and/or HSCT who presented with acute respiratory symptoms were eligible. Nasal washes were collected from children with either \u22651 upper respiratory symptom accompanied by a temperature >38.4\u00b0C, or \u22651 lower respiratory sign or symptom with or without fever. During sick visits, subjects' signs and symptoms were recorded on a standardized clinical form that documented the following symptoms: cough, wheezing, fever, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sore throat, red eyes, dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea, hoarseness and myalgia. Subjects or parents were asked about sick contacts at home and daycare or school attendance.\n\nAdditional data were collected in a retrospective review of each subject's electronic medical record including: gender, age, race, ethnicity, oxygen requirement, diagnosis of URI or LRI, radiologic studies, HSCT information (date, autologous or allogeneic, stem cell source), absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte count, immunosuppressive therapy, antiviral prophylaxis, influenza vaccination, antibiotics (prophylactic, new prescription after sick visit), steroid treatment, the presence of graft versus host disease (GvHD), and last chemotherapy. The study was approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board (IRB).\n\nSubjects with both a sample and a completed clinical form were included in the analysis. Multiple samples were accepted from subjects with repeated illnesses when separate illness episodes occurred at least one month apart. An infection was defined as the presence of a detectable study virus in the participant's sample. URI was defined as a positive RT-PCR plus \u22651 observed symptoms including cough, fever (>38.4 \u00b0C), rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, hoarseness, red eyes, or pharyngitis. LRI was defined as a positive RT-PCR plus \u22651 observed wheezing, stridor, rales, or new chest radiograph infiltrates, or clinical diagnoses of bronchiolitis, croup, or pneumonia.\n\nNasal washes were collected from each subject by instilling sterile saline solution (5mL/ nostril for children and 10 mL/nostril for teenagers-young adults) and collecting the effluent in a sterile cup. Samples were placed on ice and processed in the laboratory within 4 hours; each original sample was aliquoted and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. RNA was extracted on an automated instrument (MagMAX-96, ABI) using the MagMAX-96 Viral RNA Isolation Kit (ABI). Real-time RT-PCR assays were performed for individual viruses separately using primers and dual-labeled probes for RSV, influenza A, influenza B, PIV1, PIV2, PIV3, HRV and MPV as previously described (15, (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) . Twenty-five-\u03bcL reaction mixtures containing 5 \u03bcL of specimen RNA were tested using the AgPath-ID RT-PCR kit (ABI) on the Step One Plus instrument (ABI). Positive and negative controls were used with each run. All RT-PCR assays were optimized and characterized using RNA runoff transcripts and were capable of detecting <50 RNA transcript copies/reaction (data not shown). All samples were tested by RT-PCR assay for human beta-actin (ABI) to ensure RNA integrity.\n\nConventional RT-PCR was performed on HRV-positive specimens using primers that amplify a ~600-bp fragment encompassing the VP4/VP2 region (15, 27) . Amplified fragments were sequenced bidirectionally on a 3730xl DNA Analyzer (ABI). Sequences were edited and aligned with published HRVA, HRVB, and HRVC (HRV-1B, HRV14, and HRV-QPM) sequences obtained from GenBank using MacVector version 11.0 (MacVector) and phylogenetic analyses performed using MEGA 4.0. (28, 29) \n\nGroups were compared on the continuous variables using Wilcoxon rank sum test and categorical variables using Pearson's Chi-square test. Data were analyzed using R version 2.10.1. Due to the small number, multivariable analysis was not performed.\n\nDuring the study period 82 samples were collected from 62 subjects evaluated as inpatients or outpatients at the Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt. Four samples were excluded because complete patient information was unavailable; the analysis was based on 78 samples collected during ARI episodes from 62 subjects. Fifty out of 78 subjects provided at least one sample and 12 had \u22652 obtained.\n\nSubject demographic and clinical characteristics are listed in Table 1 . The mean age of the 62 participants was 9 years and 60% were male, with 40% of samples from HSCT recipients. The non-HSCT subjects had the following underlying conditions: acute leukemia (n=21), aplastic anemia (n=2), Langerhans cell histiocytosis (n=3), solid tumor (n=5), sickle cell anemia (n=3), myelodysplastic syndrome (n=1), autoimmune neutropenia (n=1) and Hodgkins lymphoma (n=1).\n\nAt least one respiratory virus was detected by RT-PCR in 31 (40%) of 78 nasal wash samples; these were from 31 distinct subjects. Two different respiratory viruses were detected simultaneously in 3 samples. The viruses detected and the sites of infection are listed in Table 2 . HRV were the most frequently detected viruses and were identified in 15 (48%) positive samples; followed by 7 RSV (22%), 5 influenza A (16%), 4 MPV (13%) and 2 PIV2 (6%); influenza B, PIV1 and PIV3 were not detected in any sample.\n\nFive (8%) of the 62 participants had documented history in their EMR of receiving influenza vaccine. Of those 5 participants, one tested influenza A positive by RT-PCR.\n\nThe VP4/VP2 sequence regions correlate with the serotype classification of HRV (15, 20, 27) . HRV-positive samples were sequenced using this region: 5 (33%) of those sequenced were HRVC, 9 (60%) HRVA and 1 (7%) HRVB, with substantial genetic diversity between strains ( Figure 1 ). HRV87 was used as an outgroup for phylogenetic analysis (30) . Four distinct HRVC genotypes were identified, even among this closed population ( Figure 1 ). The HRVC viruses were more genetically diverse than HRVA viruses. Of the 9 HRVA, 6 were URI and 3 LRI, HRVC were from 3 URI and 2 LRI, and the single HRVB was from URI. Of the five HRV-positive specimens associated with LRI, 3 were from subjects diagnosed with pneumonia by chest radiograph, with no bacterial pathogen identified, and 2 of those 3 were identified as HRVC.\n\nSeventy-two percent of samples were collected from outpatients. Of 31 samples with a virus detected, 64% were from participants with URI and 36% with LRI. The remaining 47 samples were collected from patients who presented with URI or LRI symptoms but without a detectable virus (details shown in Table 2 ). Cough, fever, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion were the most prominent presenting symptoms among virus-positive and virus-negative subjects, with no significant differences between groups (not shown). Nine of the 78 ARI episodes were diagnosed as clinical pneumonia by chest radiograph; of those, 4 samples were positive for respiratory viruses (3 HRV positive and 1 MPV). Three of these 4 were treated with antibiotics. None of the patients with respiratory viruses detected required ICU admission and none died.\n\nThere was not a statistically significant difference for risk of virus detection between a virus-positive or -negative sample compared for most variables analyzed; lymphocyte count was slightly higher in subjects with virus detected, though there was substantial overlap in the interquartile ranges ( Table 3) . Analysis of subjects with upper vs. lower respiratory infeciton did not identify any clinical or demographic factors significantly associated with lower respiratory infection (Table 4) .\n\nOne participant with an HRV-positive specimen was subsequently found on biopsy to have a Mycobacterium avium complex lung nodule. Three samples from symptomatic children had other possible pathogens in addition to the respiratory viruses studied; one patient with presumed Enterococcus sp. pneumonia diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage culture, one with a Candida albicans sputum culture; and a third with herpes simplex pneumonitis diagnosed by DFA and culture of bronchoalveolar lavage. No other bacterial, fungal or viral co-infections were reported in participants' medical records.\n\nForty-three of the 78 specimens were submitted to the clinical laboratory for rapid antigen testing: 33 for Flu A/B and RSV; 5 for Flu A/B; and 5 for RSV alone. Of these, 18 were RT-PCR positive but only one was Flu A positive by rapid antigen test. DFA performed in the hospital laboratory detected one case of influenza A, 1 case of RSV and 1 case of PIV-2; the same viruses were detected by RT-PCR. Thus, routine clinical testing for viral infection yielded only 4 (9%) confirmed viral cases among the 43 subjects tested. Thirty-five of 78 were not tested by the treating physician, and 13 of these were positive for a virus by RT-PCR.\n\nIn this study, RT-PCR was used to detect respiratory viruses in nasal washes from immunocompromised children with ARI symptoms. We identified respiratory viruses in 31 of 78 (40%) nasal wash samples by RT-PCR, in contrast with only 4 detected by routine clinical testing. This emphasizes the importance of using sensitive molecular techniques to detect viral etiologic agents in this high-risk population. In addition, real-time RT-PCR permitted detection of some viruses rarely identified by conventional methods, such as HRV and MPV. National proficiency testing surveys performed by the College of American Pathologists in 2013 suggests that ~200 hospital laboratories use molecular methods for respiratory virus testing (unpublished data; www.cap.org). Of these laboratories, slightly more than half use multiplex assays, while the rest use limited assays that do not detect HRV or MPV. The most common viruses we identified were HRV in nearly half of virus-positive episodes, with one-third of these HRVC.\n\nOther studies of respiratory virus infections have been conducted in oncology and HSCT patients, including children (2, 6-9, 31, 32). However, many studies use conventional methods or focus on detection of a single virus. A retrospective Korean study reported PIV as the most common virus, followed by RSV (33); however, that study used conventional methods including culture and DFA, which rarely detect HRV and MPV (15, 24) . The study only identified a virus in 6% of patients, likely due to insensitive methods, and no HRV were detected. A retrospective study in Boston included conventional testing, and PCR only if ordered by the clinician; the study reported only RSV, adenovirus, influenza, and PIV, and included only virus-positive episodes, so incidence was not calculated (34) . One prospective study compared multiplex PCR with conventional testing in a pediatric population; interestingly, that study also found HRV to be the most common virus at 63% (35) . That study did not genotype or speciate HRV specimens. As in our study, HRV infection was associated with LRI as well as URI. Only one report included genotyping of HRV in HSCT recipients, and that study included only adults; HRV was detected in 8% of 229 episodes of ARI, and 39% of virus-positive illnesses; our study identified HRV in 19% of all illnesses, and 48% of the virus-positive specimens. In this Australian cohort, HRVC was the most common species and was associated with both URI and LRI (36) .\n\nHRV are capable of causing clinical symptoms and pneumonia in adult patients with hematologic malignancies (37) . In addition, HRVA, HRVB, and HRVC can cause URI and LRI and are associated with wheezing, otitis media and sinusitis (19, 20) . The recently discovered HRVC have been linked with acute wheezing and asthma (15, 21) . Some reports suggest that HRVC are more virulent and exhibit different demographic and epidemiologic characteristics compared to HRV A (15, 21, 38) . Our data suggest that HRV-C are important pathogens in immunocompromised children.\n\nSeveral factors are reported to increase the risk for severity of viral infection in children with hematologic disorders, cancer and HSCT recipients, including lymphopenia, steroid use, and GvHD (39, 40) . In our study, none of the measured factors was statistically significantly associated with respiratory viral infection; of note, the detection of a virus in the subjects may have reflected medically significant respiratory disease leading to testing rather than differences in exposure to viruses. In addition, subjects without a virus detected may have had heterogeneous etiologies (e.g. allergic, bacterial, or fungal). The inability to identify significant associations may be due to the small number of subjects; alternatively, this entire population may be at risk for medically significant respiratory virus infections. In support of this, other similar studies failed to identify clinical and demographic risk factors except for the presence of LRI at presentation (33, 34, 41) .\n\nA minority of subjects had received inactivated influenza vaccine, yet influenza was identified in five of the children. Others have identified influenza as an important pathogen in immunocompromised children (42, 43) . While antibody responses to influenza vaccine may be lower among immunocompromised children (44, 45) , inactivated influenza vaccine is safe and recommended annually for high-risk persons. Others have found that the likelihood of receiving influenza vaccination was only slightly higher in immunocompromised children, even in a large HMO (46) . Our data suggest that influenza vaccine recommendations may not be routinely followed in all centers.\n\nOur study has several limitations. First, due to the small sample size, the collective analysis of the risk factors for respiratory viral infection may be inadequately powered. We detected relatively few infections with each individual virus. We did not test for all known respiratory viruses; however, we did test for the eight most common pediatric respiratory viruses using sensitive individual real-time RT-PCR. We did not include asymptomatic controls; literature is conflicting on how common asymptomatic infection is in the HSCT population (9, 40, 41) . It is possible that the HRV we detected was not the causative pathogen of the clinical illness; however, we excluded other viruses by RT-PCR. Thus, we think it likely that the HRV we detected were truly associated with disease.\n\nIn summary, our findings suggest that HRV, including the recently discovered species HRVC, are important pathogens in the pediatric HSCT population. Notably, conventional methods and some molecular assays will fail to detect these viruses. Molecular testing for multiple viruses should be considered the standard of care for immunocompromised patients with ARI requiring hospitalization.\n\nHRVC is a common cause of acute respiratory infections in pediatric oncology patients and stem cell transplant recipients.
