In this conflict, mutations that help the host evade the pathogen confer a 50 fitness advantage, and in turn, compensatory mutations that allow the pathogen to continue 51 exploiting the host confer an advantage to the pathogen. After multiple rounds of coevolution, 52 the pathogen becomes uniquely adapted to the host and may lose affinity for proteins found in 53 other host species, resulting in specificity (5). Host-species-specific interactions have been 54 identified in a virulence factor known as the bacterial bipartite transferrin receptor (6). This 55 .

We performed a 126 competitive assay known as a displacement ELISA, and looked at binding of whole fixed cells of 127 H. somni to bovine, ovine, caprine, and porcine transferrins. Cattle, sheep, and goats are known 128 hosts of H. somni while swine are not, and so porcine transferrin was used as a negative control 129 ( Figure 1A ). H. somni bound bovine transferrin, as expected, but also displayed some affinity for 130 ovine transferrin. There was no statistically significant binding to the caprine or porcine 131 transferrins ( Figure 1B) . 132\n\nNext, we asked whether H. somni selectively uses bovine transferrin for growth, or whether its 133 binding of ovine transferrin leads to iron uptake from both of these iron sources. We measured 134 growth in the presence of bovine, ovine, caprine, and human transferrins at various 135 concentrations, as well as in buffer alone ( Figure 1C We wondered if the relatively low levels of growth on ovine and caprine transferrin at 25 \u00b5M 145 was due to a lower number of transferrin receptors being expressed at the cell surface under more 146 stringent conditions. This low expression may be due to the sudden shift between an iron-replete 147 and iron-starving environment. To address this, we performed another experiment where we 148 \"pre-starved\" the cells by growing them under iron-limiting conditions that were not as stringent 149 as those used in the previous experiment (see Methods) . In this case, following the pre-starvation 150 step, cells showed growth in the presence of bovine, ovine, and caprine transferrins at 25 \u00b5M 151 when compared to growth on human transferrin or buffer alone ( Figure 1D ). 152\n\nWe concluded that H. somni H191 does not exhibit strict specificity for bovine transferrin. 153 However, it does display a preference for bovine transferrin while also having affinity for 154 transferrins of other bovids. To determine which transferrin binding protein(s) was responsible 155 for this binding profile, we went on to investigate each Tbp separately in a heterologous system. To address the binding contribution of each of the transferrin binding proteins (TbpA, TbpA2  160 and TbpB), we expressed His-tagged TbpAs, TbpA2, and GST-tagged HsTbpB independently in 161 E. coli, and performed displacement ELISAs (Figure 2 ). E. coli does not encode any of these 162 three receptors and so this served as an appropriate heterologous system. TbpA assays were 163 .

An 165 interaction was denoted as \"specific\" when unlabeled bovine transferrin lowered the absorbance 166 signal to 10% or less of the maximum and other unlabeled competitor transferrins did not 167 decrease the signal significantly. TbpA specifically bound bovine transferrin ( Figure 2B ). 168\n\nControl TbpAs from the ruminant pathogen Mannheimia haemolytica and from the porcine 169 pathogen Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae were used to validate the assay. The TbpAs from 170 these pathogens bound specifically to their cognate transferrins in our assay. We used a similar 171 approach to evaluate whether HsTbpB binding was specific for bovine transferrin. A 172 displacement ELISA using soluble GST-HsTbpB showed that unlike HsTbpA, HsTbpB binds 173 bovine, ovine, and caprine transferrins, but has higher affinity for bovine transferrin ( Figure 2C ). 174\n\nHuman transferrin was used as a negative control. 175\n\nWe also asked whether our strain of H. somni encoded a TbpA2, and whether this receptor was 176 as selective as TbpA. At the time these experiments were performed, a limited number of H. 177 somni genomes were available in NCBI and it was unclear how widespread TbpA2 was among 178 H. somni strains. We amplified out HsTbpA2 from strain H191, and cloned and expressed it in E. 179 coli. We then performed a displacement ELISA in the same way as had been performed for 180\n\nTbpA. HsTbpA2 clearly bound bovine transferrin,which supports a previous report illustrating 181 that the H. somni TbpA2 homolog is a transferrin binding protein. Moreover, HsTbpA2 like, 182\n\nHsTbpA, appears to selectively bind bovine transferrin in this assay ( Figure 2D ). 183\n\nWhile our displacement ELISAs suggested that TbpB is responsible for the binding of H. somni 184 to multiple bovid transferrins, we decided to complement our competitive binding experiments 185 with direct binding assays to gain additional support for this result. We performed direct binding 186 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

We also measured binding of a TbpB from Neisseria 210 meningitidis, a human pathogen, to determine the affinity of TbpBs for non-cognate transferrins. 211\n\nWe observed no binding of NmTbpB to ovine transferrin within the concentration range used in 212 the experiment ( Figure 4D ). Taken together, our results suggest that H. somni TbpB is more 213 promiscuous than HsTbpA, and may, along with HsTbpA2, contribute to iron uptake from ovine Many pathogens have host species-specific receptors that arise from a process of coevolution 218 with the host. The sites that bear signatures of this coevolution tend to be functionally important, 219 and so identifying them can lend insight into how a given receptor functions. Furthermore, host-220 specific interactions restrict pathogens to infecting a single host species or a narrow range of host 221 species (31). This host specificity or host restriction can create a barrier to studying infection in 222 animal models. A better understanding of the underlying mechanism of specificity could lead to 223 the design of animal infection models that mimic the progress of disease more accurately(32). 224\n\nThe Tbps are host-specific receptors used by some host-restricted Proteobacteria for iron 225 acquisition. The interaction between Tbps and their cognate transferrin has been shown to be a 226 prerequisite for infection by Tbp-encoding bacteria. We looked for the most closely-related set of 227 transferrins that could be distinguished by a Tbp system and found a paper reporting that H. 228 somni binds bovine, but not ovine or caprine transferrins. Testing each receptor individually, we 229 found that H. somni TbpA showed no detectable affinity for ovine or caprine transferrins. 230 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/730739 doi: bioRxiv preprint However, we found the TbpB and an additional transferrin binding TBDT, TbpA2, did bind 231 ovine and caprine transferrins. Furthermore, the affinities of HsTbpB for the ovine and caprine 232 transferrins is high enough to allow HsTbpB to bind them in the blood. We observed that H. 233 somni can utilize bovine, ovine, and caprine, but not human transferrin for growth. There are 234 four possibilities that can account for our observations; firstly, HsTbpA2 may work alone to 235 promote iron uptake from ovine and caprine transferrins; alternatively, HsTbpB may interact 236 with TbpA2 to promote iron uptake; finally, HsTbpB may work with HsTbpA to promote iron 237 uptake from the ovine and caprine transferrin C-lobes, with or without the accompaniment of 238\n\nHsTbpA2, which is expected to take up iron from the N-lobe. A surface lipoprotein 239 compensating for lack of function in a TBDT is a phenomenon that has been observed 240 previously. For example,the function of a neisserial TbpA with mutations that reduced its 241 binding to human transferrin could be partially rescued when it was co-expressed with TbpB 242 (33). The mechanistic basis of this compensatory effect on the part of TbpB remains unknown. 243\n\nOne possibility is that TbpB binding increases the local concentration of transferrin in the area 244 around TbpA, thereby increasing the on rate enough to allow for iron uptake and thereby 245 promoting growth. Another possibility is that the association of the transferrin-TbpB complex 246\n\nwith TbpA leads to a conformational change that increases the affinity of TbpA for transferrin. 247\n\nIn this study, we conclude that TbpB can serve to broaden the host transferrin recognition range 248 of H. somni because its affinity for ovine and caprine transferrins is high enough to promote 249 binding in the blood. Our conclusions are based on reported serum transferrin concentrations. The H. somni transferrin receptors were chosen for specificity studies because they had been 268 reported to distinguish between very similar transferrins. However, we did not find the H. somni 269\n\nTbps to be as selective as reported. It is likely that the difference between our observations and 270 previously published results is due to differences in assay sensitivity. Furthermore, because 271\n\nHsTbpA2 is phase variable, it is possible that HsTbpA2 was not expressed in the bacteria used in 272 the whole-cell binding assays of the previously published study, which means that TbpA 273 specificity may have had a larger relative effect on the results. It is worth noting that a previous 274 study that identified TbpA2 in another strain of H. somni also suggested that H. somni has two 275 sets of receptors, one specific for bovine transferrin and another that bound bovine, ovine, and 276 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/730739 doi: bioRxiv preprint caprine transferrins (16). However, this paper does not conclusively determine which Tbps are 277 responsible for each binding pattern. 278\n\nThere were some discrepancies between the results obtained in the assays used in our study. 279\n\nFirstly, while H. somni appears to grow to similar levels on ovine and caprine transferrins, it 280 appears to bind ovine transferrin with a higher affinity than caprine transferrin. This higher 281 relative affinity for ovine transferrin compared to caprine was also observed in experiments 282 using only HsTbpA2 and only HsTbpB. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that 283 growth-promoting synergistic interactions between Tbps were not picked up in the binding 284 assays. Measuring the growth of tbpB and tbpA2 knockouts on various transferrin iron sources 285 would provide insight into whether and how these receptors work together. Secondly, binding of 286\n\nHsTbpA2 to ovine and caprine transferrins was observed in the direct ELISA but not the 287 displacement ELISA (Figure 24D and 25B) . This is likely because the displacement ELISA did 288 not have sufficient dynamic range to capture this difference in affinity. This difference would 289 likely be observed at higher ratios of competitor to labeled transferrin. Interestingly, in the 290 HsTbpA2 displacement ELISA, the signal obtained using a competitor porcine transferrin was 291 significantly higher than the signal obtained with no competitor ( Figure 24D ). This points to a 292 flaw in the assay that cannot at present be explained. However, the difference in signal between 293 the ovine and porcine, and caprine and porcine columns was not significant. It is clear that a 294 more quantitative approach with purified TbpA2 is needed for follow-up binding assays. 295\n\nMeasuring the binding affinities between HsTbpA2 and the bovine, ovine, and caprine 296 transferrins would provide the most accurate information about the relative strengths of these 297 interactions. 298 .

This could still be 300 done to identify important sites of contact between the Tbps and transferrin. However, in the 301 case of HsTbpB and HsTbpA2, this would not be a screen for \"all-or-none\" changes in binding, 302 but instead would likely involve precise measurements of changes in affinity. BLI, or a similarly 303 sensitive technique that allows for quantitative binding analysis, would be ideal for these kinds 304 TBDT-dependent nutrient uptake systems can be either be monopartite, bipartite, or even 308 multipartite, such as the Sus system in Bacteroides (39). TBDTs do not inherently require 309 affiliated SLPs or other TBDTs to function. What then are the potential advantages of 310 multipartite systems? TbpA is always found in an operon with TbpB and the latter has been 311 shown to be essential for host colonization in the absence of lactoferrin receptors (12). However, 312 the reason for this is not understood. TbpB is hypothesized to be important because it 313 preferentially binds holo-transferrin. TbpA has no preference for transferrin's iron loaded state, 314 and so TbpB is thought to greatly increase the efficiency of iron acquisition. Furthermore, TbpA 315 and TbpB have been shown to function synergistically and together, have a higher affinity for 316 transferrin than either protein does alone. In this study we propose another advantage of having 317 an accessory SLP: the expansion of substrate range. In multipartite nutrient uptake systems such 318 as the Sus proteins, accessory lipoproteins are known to modulate substrate specificity (40). We 319\n\npropose that HsTbpB also acts as a modulator, by broadening the specificity of the H. somni 320 transferrin receptor. 321 samples were centrifuged at 3000g to remove insoluble components and initially fractionated via 358 ammonium sulfate precipitation. Ammonium sulfate was added to the serum to achieve a 40% 359 saturation at 4\u00b0C and dissolved at room temperature by end-over-end mixing. Once no more 360 undissolved ammonium sulfate crystals were visible in the serum, the serum was centrifuged at 361 12 000g to remove precipitate. It was often necessary to perform two centrifugation steps, 362 transferring the soluble fraction to a new tube in between steps, to remove all the precipitate. 363\n\nFurther ammonium sulfate cuts were performed by adding ammonium sulfate to saturations of 364 55%, 70%, and 85% at 4\u00b0C. The 70% fraction, which is expected to contain most of the 365 transferrin, was resuspended in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and dialyzed in 2 L of the same buffer for 8-366\n\n.

Samples of the other fractions were dialyzed 367 concurrently and used for SDS-PAGE analysis. 368\n\nThe dialyzed 70% ammonium sulfate fraction was further purified using anion exchange 369 chromatography using an in-house packed 25 mL Q-Sepharose column. After multiple rounds of 370 chromatography, primarily done to separate transferrin from albumin, the protein was 371 concentrated and size exclusion chromatography using an S75 column (GE) was used for buffer 372 exchange into PBS. The protein was concentrated further (if necessary), aliquoted, flash-frozen, 373 and stored at -80 C. 374\n\nH. somni strain H191 was grown overnight at 37\u00baC and 5% CO2 on chocolate agar plates 376 containing 1% IsoVitalex. Cells were harvested from plates, washed once in PBS, and 377 resuspended at an OD 600 of 0.05 in BHI broth containing 0.5% yeast extract, 0.05% thiamine 378 pyrophosphate and 50 uM deferoxamine, and left to grow for 16 hours overnight at 37\u00baC with 379\n\nshaking.

Cells were washed once in PBS + 382 10 mM MgCl 2 and resuspended at an OD 600 of 10 in the same buffer. 100 uL of cells per well 383 was applied to 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture plates (Sarstedt). Plates were incubated for 3 384 hours at room temperature in a biosafety cabinet. Plates were then washed once with PBS and 385 patted dry. 50 uL of 6.6 nM biotinylated transferrin and 50 uL of 132 nM of unlabeled transferrin 386 was applied to each well and left to incubate for 2 hours at room temperature.

Plates were washed 3 390 times with PBS. Binding was detected with 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate 391 (Sigma), reactions were stopped with 2 M HCl, and absorbance was read at 450 nm. Signal of 392 wells containing buffer instead of cells was subtracted from all reads. Wells including cells but 393 not labeled transferrins were also used to monitor for nonspecific binding. Absorbance readings 394 were normalized to the signal of wells containing no competitor. Data was plotted and analyzed 395 in Graphpad Prism. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by 396\n\nDunnett's post test. Normalized readings were compared to a value of 1, the normalized signal 397 for the \"no competitor\" column, and the value that is expected when no binding occurs. 398\n\nWhole-cell ELISAs with E. coli 399 5 colonies each of E. coli C43 were inoculated into 1 mL of LB medium containing 5 ug/mL 400 kanamycin sulfate.
