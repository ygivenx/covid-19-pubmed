{"title": "COVID-19 Myocarditis and Severity Factors\uff1a An Adult Cohort Study Authors", "body": "the severe group was significantly higher than that in the nonsevere group (52.5\n\n[42. .5] vs 20 [5.0-31.6 ]; p<0.001). Amongst 84 patients, 13 patients (15.48%) were noted with abnormal electrocardiograms (ECGs) and serum myocardial enzyme levels;\n\nwhereas 4 (4.8%) were clinically diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis. Multivariable logistic regress analysis distinguished three key independent risk factors for the severity of COVID- 19 \n\nThree key-independent risk factors of COVID-19 were identified, including age, PII, and Ct value. The Ct value is closely correlated with the severity of COVID-19, and may act as a predictor of clinical severity of COVID-19 in the early stage. SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis should be highlighted despite a relatively low incidence rate (4.8%). The oxygen pressure and blood oxygen saturation should not be neglected as closely linked with the altitude of epidemic regions.\n\nof RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. 5 Despite high viral load reflected by low Ct values (13.73 for ORF1ab gene, 15 .57 for N gene), the infant was asymptomatic. Notably, scarce evidence is available on viral load and clinical outcome, notwithstanding RT-PCR has been widely used in clinical practice.\n\nWhereas these frontier studies presented critical lines of evidence on the emerging infectious disease as COVID-19, most patients were undergoing treatment with unclear outcome when data were summarized. Therefore, several critical issues still remain mysterious, i.e., prognostic factors for COVID-19 including extrinsic factors as viral load of SARS-CoV-2 and intrinsic factors as individual's health conditions, including those identified as candidate risk factors (older age, underlying comorbidities, higher levels of white blood cell and neutrophils counts, D-dimer, creatine kinase, and creatine). 6 Nevertheless, the clinical significance of abnormal serum myocardial enzymes identified by previous studies [6] [7] [8] has not been well documented, in particular viral potentiality of myocardial damage and underlying mechanisms. Accordingly, the study aimed for addressing these important issues based on a retrospective observational study of 84 adult cases in Chongqing municipality, China (adjacent to Hubei Province).\n\n.

As an officially nominated hospital for COVID-19 patients, Yongchuan Hospital (affiliated to Chongqing Medical University) has been in charge of the treatment of COVID-19 cases from Yongchuan District, Chongqing municipality (close to Hubei Province). The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Yongchuan Hospital (No. 2020KLS-6). We obtained oral informed consent for involved patients and/or their relatives. All consecutive adult cases (aged over 18 years) diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. All patients were under close surveillance until Mar 2, 2020.\n\nDemographic, epidemiologic, radiologic imaging and laboratory data were collected by intensive medical record reviews of included cases, with double checks and additional inquiries when appropriate. The diagnosis and treatment were conducted strictly conforming to the COVID-19 national program provided by the National Health Commission of China (5 th edition). 9\n\nEach patient underwent double tests for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection every 24 hours on his/her nasopharyngeal swab samples. In brief, viral nucleic acid from samples was conducted using viral isolation kits (Daangene, Guangzhou, China). Fluorescence .

Subsequently, follow-up chest CT scans were performed when suitable.\n\nDiagnostic images were analyzed by experienced radiologists. Pulmonary inflammation index (PII) was estimated according to the criteria proposed by Chongqing Radiologist Association of China, 10 with distribution and size of lesions estimated. As for distribution, one lung segment equals one score with highest score as 20, representing left and right lung lesions. For lesion size, 1 score indicates over 50% lung segment volume invasive, whereas 0 score less than 50%. Accordingly, PII= (Distribution score+ Size score)/40*100%. PII values were calculated twice at three week intervals by two experienced radiologists. Interclass coefficient was used to assess inter-rater reliability.\n\nAt admission, each patient underwent ECG examinations routinely. Each electrocardiogram was evaluated and reported by senior technicians. Abnormal ECGs were collected and analyzed in combination of clinical manifestations and serum myocardial enzyme tests. Repeated ECGs were ordered for patients suspected with myocardial damage.\n\nData were recorded and summarized using spreadsheets.

Risk factors with a univariable p-value<0.05 were eligible for inclusion in the model. Severe group was coded as \"1\" and nonsevere group was coded as \"0\". Variables (p\u22640.10) were in the final model, with significant variables identified (p<0.05), via a forward and stepwise protocol. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs, indicating pertaining digital times more likely to present in severe group) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as independent risk factors.\n\nSpearman's correlations were used to assess the links between multiple factors.\n\n.

An excellent inter-rater reliability was noted in the assessment of failure, and 6(7.1%) cases with renal abnormalities. Except for gastrointestinal disorders, the incidence of all complications in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the non-severe group (p<0.05). Of the 20 patients with respiratory failure, 9(45%) were treated with assisted mechanical ventilation, 7(35%) with nasal catheters and 4(20%) with masks. The median time from onset to respiratory failure was 7.75 days and to mechanical ventilation was 8 days.\n\nAmong all 84 patients, we found 13 patients with abnormal myocardial injury indicators combined with abnormal ECG, including 8 severe patients and 5 nonsevere patients (table 5). Four of the 13 patients had a history of cardiovascular diseases, while the other 9 patients had no such history. There were 3 cases with a history of hypertension, 1 patient with hypertension, atrial fibrillation and coronary heart disease .

The 12 remaining patients had abnormal changes in the myocardial enzymes or cTnI, amongst which 10 cases with high levels of inflammatory markers (except for patient no.9 and 11), and eleven of them exhibiting clinical symptoms of myocardial injury (except for patient no. 9).\n\nTypical abnormal ECG findings were noted in ten patients (except for patient no.2, 6 and 12). Major ECG abnormalities included sinus tachycardia or bradycardia, t-wave changes, atrioventricular block, and anomaly Q wave. Four patients underwent repeated ECG examinations. Patient no. 3 was an elderly female patient in the severe group. The first ECG indicated t-wave changes and sinus bradycardia. However, repeated ECG restored normal after treatment with a decrease in inflammatory markers and cardiac enzyme levels. Patient no. 4 was an elderly male patient in the severe group. His first ECG indicated First-degree atrioventricular block, t-wave changes, left axis deviation and abnormal Q wave in the lower wall, while the abnormal Q and t-wave disappeared after treatments. Patient no. 9 and 10 were in the nonsevere group. Their initial ECGs showed sinus tachycardia and sinus tachycardia associated with t-wave changes respectively, with repeated normal ECGs after treatment. .

Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis was diagnosed clinically with an incidence rate of 4.8%. Previous neglected regional altitude issue was considered for COVID-19 severity classification.\n\nPrevious studies mainly focused on the clinical characteristics, imaging findings and treatment measures of COVID-19, 2,3,5-8 however, few studies pay attention to its risk factors and complications. [14] [15] [16] There were significant differences between severe and nonsevere COVID-19 in age, clinical manifestations, imaging findings, levels of inflammatory cytokines and myocardial enzymes, and distribution of lymphocytes and their subsets, consistent with previous studies. 3,5-8 Furthermore, multivariable logistic regress analysis identified three key independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19, i.e., age, PII, and Ct values.\n\nCt values from the RT-PCR can act as a proxy for viral load. 17, 18 In viral respiratory infectious diseases, viral load has been proved to be closely related to the severity of the diseases. [19] [20] [21] It is still unclear whether the virus load is closed related to the severity of COVID-19 patients, although sporadic case studies have been reported 18, 22 . We found that the patients' viral load was associated with severity of COVID-19 as an independent risk factor.\n\nIn addition, all the complications (except for gastrointestinal disorders) of COVID-2019 during hospitalization were found significantly higher in severe than .

Among all patients, a total of 36 patients had a high level of cardiac enzymes or cTnI. After excluding the history of cardiac diseases and combining the ECG and clinical manifestations, 4 patients were clinically diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis according to most updated diagnostic criteria, 12, 13 of which 3 cases occurred in severe group and 1 in nonsevere group. However, the pathological mechanism by which the COVID-19 causes viral myocarditis is still uncertain. There are some limitations in our study. Firstly, the sample size in our study was relatively small, only 84 patients were included. The deadline of the collected data was March 2, 2020, with 16 patients still hospitalized. Secondly, we did not get exact viral load of patients as viral copy numbers due to the urgent outbreak of COVID-19 and limited conditions. We used Ct values as a substitute. Nevertheless, the results of multivariable logistic regress model demonstrated that the Ct value of SARS-CoV-2 is valid and reliable.\n\n.

The echocardiography and cardiac MRI were unavailable due to limited protective measures. However, we strictly excluded the interference of the patient's cardiac history, and made a clinical diagnosis based on the clinical manifestations of myocardial injury, high levels of cardiac enzymes and cTn I, as well as typical ECG changes, which were consistent with the most updated diagnostic criteria of viral myocarditis. 12,13\n\nThree key-independent risk factors of COVID-19 were identified, including age, PII, and Ct value.
