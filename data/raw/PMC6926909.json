{"title": "Spread of Infectious Disease Modeling and Analysis of Different Factors on Spread of Infectious Disease Based on Cellular Automata", "body": "Infectious diseases are diseases that can be transmitted from person to person, from person to animal, or from animal to animal after proto-microorganisms and parasites infect human beings or animals [1,2,3]. Infectivity, epidemic, and uncertainty are the three main characteristics of infectious diseases. A thorough study of the spread causes, spread routes, spread processes, and epidemic laws of infectious diseases is the main method for effective prevention, control, and elimination of infectious diseases.\n\nAt present, the mathematical study of infectious diseases is mainly based on the theory and method of infectious disease dynamics [4,5,6]. The essence of infectious disease dynamics is to establish a mathematical model that can reflect the spread process, spread law, and spread trend of infectious diseases. Its advantage is that, according to the characteristics of infectious diseases, the model of infectious diseases is reasonably assumed, the appropriate parameters are set, and the appropriate variables are selected. Then, the dynamic characteristics of infectious diseases can be clearly revealed. It has laid a solid foundation for further analysis of the causes and key factors of the spread of infectious diseases, and for seeking the optimal strategies for the prevention and control of such diseases.\n\nThe main method to study and forecast the spread mechanism of infectious diseases is to establish mathematical models. Some of these are used to study the general laws of infectious diseases, while others are used to study specific infectious diseases, such as HFMD (Hand foot and mouth disease), tuberculosis, AIDS, and so on. In 1760, Bernoulli [7] began using mathematical models to study the spread of smallpox by vaccination. In 1906, Hamer [8] constructed and analyzed a discrete time model for the study of recurrent measles epidemics. In 1927, Kermack and McKendrick [9] proposed the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) compartmental model for the first time in order to study the epidemic law of the Black Death prevailing in Europe at that time. On the basis of the SIR model\u2019s analysis, the \"threshold theory\" was proposed to distinguish the spread or regression of the disease. The validity of the SIR model has been proven by the data regarding large-scale infectious diseases in history, thus the deterministic model [10] based on a differential equation has been widely accepted.\n\nWith the deepening of research, the factors involved in establishing the mathematical model are increasing, and the dimension of the model is also increasing. Based on the classical SIR model, Aron and Schwartz [11] proposed the SEIR(Susceptible-Exposed-Infective-Recovered) model in 1984. That model considers that the latency of infectious diseases also has an impact on infectious diseases, so the model is more realistic. Focusing on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) infectious disease spread in recent years, Safi and Gumel [12] constructed the SEQIJR(Susceptible-Exposed-Quarantine-Infective-Isolation-Recovered) model according to the characteristics of SARS. Small and Chi [13] studied the effects of vaccination and isolation on the SARS epidemic and constructed the SEIRP (Susceptible-Exposed- Infective- Recovered-Persevered) model.\n\nIn addition, some researchers start with the population structure of infectious disease spread and study the spread model of infectious disease. According to the influence of age on the spread of infectious diseases, Boklund et al. [14] proposed a model to better characterize the effect of age heterogeneity on the spread of infectious diseases. According to the difference in population, Meng et al. [15] divided the population into different groups, and they proved the global stability of disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium.\n\nWith the development of artificial intelligence, the network dynamics model has gradually become a new research method of infectious disease model. The most common network dynamics models include the ordinary differential equation model, the discrete differential equation model, the impulsive differential equation model, and the differential equation model with time delay. The main methods are finite equation theory, matrix theory, bifurcation theory, K-order monotone system theory, central manifold theory, Lasalle invariant principle, etc. However, these research methods are all theoretical studies on infectious diseases, but it is difficult to apply them to practical problems.\n\nThe concept of cellular automata was proposed in the 1940s. Cellular automata can be described as a dynamic system consisting of a transformation function in cellular space, which is discrete in time and space. The cellular automata model can be formally expressed as CA=(LC,S,M,f), where CA represents the cellular automaton system, LC represents the mesh space which is divided according to given rules, a mesh corresponding to a cell of cellular automata, S represents the set of cell states, M=(C1,C2,\u2026,Cn) represents the set of current cell adjacent to cells, and f represents the transformation function which can transform Cn to C, the function that can calculate the state of cell C at t + 1 time according to the state of adjacent cells of cell C at t time. Adjacent cells are Moore neighbors with radius = 1. As shown in Figure 1, cells can move in eight directions.\n\nMisra et al. [16] gave a comprehensive introduction to the theory and application of cellular automata. Since the 1990s, epidemic spread models based on cellular automata [17,18,19,20] have been extensively studied. According to the characteristics and mechanism of AIDS, Pan et al. [21] proposed a spread model of AIDS based on cellular automata. L\u00f3pez et al. [22] proposed an epidemic spread model based on cellular automata that considers individual heterogeneity, population mobility ratio, and individual maximum moving distance. Because cellular automata can perform some experiments that cannot be done in real life by modeling, we can analyze the actual situation and obtain the results, in order to solve the complex problems that cannot be dealt with in the deterministic model. It is thus becoming a typical representative of the network dynamics model.\n\nBased on the ability of cellular automata to model complex problems, this paper considered that, in real society, population mobility is caused by economic development, living environment, education level, and other factors, and that population density, sex ratio, and age structure of area also have some influence on the spread of infectious diseases. An epidemic spread model Susceptible-Latent-Infected-Recovered-Dead-Susceptible (SLIRDS) based on cellular automata was therefore established.\n\nThe contributions of our research are as follows:A more realistic epidemic spread model based on cellular automata was established and achieved good results in simulation experiments.The effects of population density, sex ratio, and age structure on the spread of infectious diseases were discussed, and the simulation results were analyzed to observe the effects of the above three factors on the spread process of infectious diseases.The suggestions given in this paper based on the three influencing factors provided strong support for researchers to study the spread process of infectious diseases in different environments.\n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. The methodology of our research is introduced in Section 2. Simulation results and analysis are given in Section 3. Discussions are presented in Section 4. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 5.\n\nOn the basis of the SIR and SIS (Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible) models, the state of the population was divided into susceptible, latent, infected, recovered, and dead. The total number of members of the population is denoted as N(t). S(t) represents susceptible population, meaning the number of members of the population who are not infected but are susceptible to infection at time t. Latent population is denoted as L(t), meaning the number of members of the population infected at time t but not yet affected, and at this time the individual is not infectious. Infected population is denoted as I(t), meaning the number of members of the population who are infected and have infectivity at time t. Recovered population is denoted as R(t), meaning the number of members of the population who are immune at t time and will not be infected for a certain period of time. Dead population is denoted as D(t), meaning the number of members of the population who died of infectious diseases at time t, and individuals are not infectious at the moment.\n\nThe SLIRDS model can be described through the following differential equation models:(1){dS(t)d(t)=\u03b4R(t)\u2212\u03b2S(t)I(t)dL(t)d(t)=\u03b4S(t)I(t)\u2212\u03c9L(t)dI(t)d(t)=\u03c9L(t)\u2212\u03b3I(t)\u2212\u03bbD(t)dD(t)d(t)=\u03bbI(t)dR(t)d(t)=\u03b3I(t)\u2212\u03b4R(t)i(O)=io,s(O)=so    ,\nwhere \u03b4 represents the proportion of the population who lost immunity to the infectious disease, \u03b2 is the ratio coefficient of the infection rate, \u03c9 is the latency ratio coefficient of the infectious disease, \u03b3 is the ratio coefficient of the recovered infected population, and io and so represent the ratio of infected and susceptible individuals in the initial population, respectively.\n\nThe transition relationships of states in the SLIRDS model are shown in Figure 2.\n\nIn order to simulate the phenomenon of crowd movement in the real world, this paper introduced the idea of random walk cellular automata to simulate individual movement in the crowd. Considering the limitation of individual movement, the maximum step length L is set for individual movement. At the same time, considering the individual activity m, all individuals are scanned randomly in each time step, and the individuals whose proportion is m are selected. di and dj (|di|,|dj|\u2264L) are chosen randomly for each selected individual C(i,j), and then C(i,j) and C(i+di,j+dj) are exchanged to complete the individual movement.\n\nIn this paper, the SLIRDS epidemic model based on cellular automata is proposed. Assuming that the environment of the crowd is a regular N=n\u00d7n mesh space, a sparse matrix whose density is \u03c1=Cn/N (Cn is the set of individuals) is generated randomly. Each non-zero element of the matrix represents an effective individual. M represents the neighbor set of cellular nodes, and it uses a Moore neighbor with radius = 1. S(i,j)(t)={0,1,2,3,4} is used to represent the cell state in the i-th row and the j-th column at time t. Different values represent different states as follows:\n\nS(i,j)(t)=1 represents susceptible state, meaning that individuals are not infected and they are immune to this infectious disease;\n\nS(i,j)(t)=2 represents latent state, meaning that individuals have been infected, but they do not have infectivity;\n\nS(i,j)(t)=3 represents infected state, meaning that individuals are infected and infectious;\n\nS(i,j)(t)=4 represents recovered state, meaning that individuals have recovered and acquired immunity within a certain period of time;\n\nS(i,j)(t)=0 represents dead state, meaning that individuals are dead and they do not have infectivity. \n\nBecause cellular automata cannot reflect every individual\u2019s and their neighbors\u2019 randomness, unified parameters T1, T2, and T3 are introduced, T1 representing the maximum peak of latency time for each individual, T2 representing the maximum peak of illness time for each individual, and T3 representing the maximum peak of immunization time for each individual. T1(S(i,j)(t)) represents latency time of the individual, T2(S(i,j)(t)) represents illness time of the individual, and T3(S(i,j)(t)) represents immunization time of the individual.\n\nIn real life, because there are differences in climate, economy, education, and medical treatment, the population is not divided by rules like cellular automata. For example, in China, the population density in the southeast coastal areas is greater than that in the northwest. In addition, because of the different distribution of business districts, schools, and hospitals, the distribution of population in the same city is not uniform. In areas with a large population density, the distance between individuals is shorter and the spread range of individuals is wider. Individuals in the population have higher contact frequency and more neighbors around them, so their infectivity and the probability of being infected also increase.\n\nIn order to study and analyze the influence of population density on infectious disease spread, each individual is mapped into a cell in the cellular automata model. When there is no individual and the individual is in dead state in a cell, they are not infectious. In order to simulate the difference in population density, the population density can be simulated by setting the value of D(t) in the initial state. At this time, D(t) does not represent the number of dead individuals, but represents that there is no individual in the cell. In this paper, a sparse matrix was used to simulate the random distribution of population and the infectious disease spread, and then the trend of infectious disease spread under different population densities as well as the influence of different population densities on infectious disease spread were analyzed.\n\nDue to the influence of economic development and other factors, the population ratio and age structure in different regions are also different. For example, young and middle-aged people in remote mountainous areas go to work in big cities, resulting in a large number of old and young people in the original area. In areas where labor is scarce, such as coal mines and crude oil mining areas, there is an imbalance in the proportion of men to women. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to study the influence of sex ratio and age structure on infectious disease spread.\n\nIn real life, because of different living environments, living habits, resistance levels to viruses, infectious abilities to diseases, levels of drug resistance, and spread ranges, and in order to simulate the spread mechanism of infectious diseases more accurately, it is particularly important to consider individual heterogeneity, establish an infectious disease spread model, and further analyze and predict the spread mechanism of the epidemic situation.\n\nIn this paper, the probability of infection P(i,j)(t) was used to describe individual heterogeneity. Individual heterogeneity is determined by the individual\u2019s resistance to disease and the infectivity of neighbor cells.\n\nThe state of neighbor cells of cell C(i,j) at (i, j) can be expressed by an adjacency matrix as follows:(2)NC(i,j)=[S(i\u22121,j\u22121)(t)S(i\u22121,j)(t)S(i\u22121,j+1)(t)S(i,j\u22121)(t)S(i,j)(t)S(i,j+1)(t)S(i+1,j\u22121)(t)S(i+1,j)(t)S(i+1,j+1)(t)]\n\nAfter three times spread, its adjacency matrix is defined as follows:(3)QC(i,j)=[C(i\u22121,j\u22121)(t)C(i\u22121,j)(t)C(i\u22121,j+1)(t)C(i,j\u22121)(t)C(i,j)(t)C(i,j+1)(t)C(i+1,j\u22121)(t)C(i+1,j)(t)C(i+1,j+1)(t)]\n\nThe infection rate of cell C(i,j) at time t is defined as follows:(4)P(i,j)(t)=a4\u2211(k,l)\u2208QC(i,j)k\u2260i and i\u2260j{PC(i,j),C(k,l)(t)}+b4\u2211(k,l)\u2208QC(i,j)k=i or i=j{PC(i,j),C(k,l)(t)}\nwhere PC(i,j),C(k,l)(t) is used to describe the probability of cell C(i,j) infected by cell C(k,l) at time t. \n\nBecause the probability of infection is inversely proportional to one\u2019s own resistance, it is proportional to the infectivity of one\u2019s neighbors. Thus, it can be expressed as follows:(5)PC(i,j),C(k,l)(t)=fC(i,j),C(k,l)(1\u2212RC(i,j))\nwhere fC(i,j),C(k,l) represents the infectivity of cell C(k,l) to cell C(i,j) (because of the difference in the constitution of different individuals, they have different infectivity and resistance) and fC(i,j),C(k,l) obeys (0,1) uniform distribution [23]. RC(i,j) represents the infectious disease resistance of cell C(i,j). Some diseases have different influences on different sex and age groups, that is, individual sex and age differences are also important factors affecting an individual\u2019s resistance to disease. Thus, it can be expressed as follows:(6)RC(i,j)=[gm,gf][fmff][y1,\u2026,yn][f1\u2026fn]TC(i,j)\nwhere gm and gf represent the proportion of males and females in the population, fm and ff represent the influence coefficient of infectious diseases on males and females, y1,\u2026,yn are the proportion of various age groups in the population, f1,\u2026,fn are the influence coefficient of infectious diseases on n groups of populations, and TC(i,j) obeys (0,1) uniform distribution [23]. The infection probability of each individual is determined by its own resistance to infectious diseases and the infectivity of its neighbors. At each time step, the individual state is updated synchronously.\n\nAccording to a given population density, the sparse matrix is generated to simulate the distribution of population, and then through the age structure and sex ratio, each individual sets their attribute values. The initial state of all individuals is set to S = 1, the state of the infected individuals is set to S = 2. Individuals in cells are updated according to the following rules:\n\n(1) When S(i,j)(t)=1, individual infection probability P(i,j)(t) is calculated, and then whether the individual will be transformed into S(i,j)(t)=2 is determined. Otherwise, S(i,j)(t)=1. Meanwhile, individual latency time T1(S(i,j)(t))=T1(S(i,j)(t))+1.\n\n(2) When S(i,j)(t)=2, when T1(S(i,j)(t))<T1, S(i,j)(t+1)=2. Otherwise, S(i,j)(t+1)=3. Meanwhile, individual illness time T2(S(i,j)(t))=T2(S(i,j)(t))+1.\n\n(3) When S(i,j)(t)=3, when T2(S(i,j)(t))<T2, S(i,j)(t+1)=3. Otherwise, the individual enters into dead state with probability \u03bb, and S(i,j)(t+1)=0; the rest of individuals have recovered and acquired immunity, and S(i,j)(t+1)=4. Meanwhile, individual immunization time T3(S(i,j)(t))=T3(S(i,j)(t))+1.\n\n(4) When S(i,j)(t)=4, when T3(S(i,j)(t))\u2265T3, individual immunity to the infectious disease disappears with probability \u03b4. The individual then turns into susceptible state, S(i,j)(t)=1.\n\n(5) At each time step, all individuals move.\n\nAll things being equal, the parameters of two simulations for the SLIRDS model were set as follows:\n\n(1) Population density \u03c1=1, susceptible population:latent population:infected population = 0.872:0.107:0.021.\n\n(2) Population density \u03c1=0.8, susceptible population:latent population:infected population = 0.6985:0.0855:0.016.\n\nTwo simulation results are shown in Figure 4.\n\nIn Figure 4, considering the difference in population base, the number of members of the population that died, were susceptible, were infected, and were immunized was replaced by death, susceptibility, infection and immunization rates to describe the changes in population in different states.\n\nFrom the death rate curve in Figure 4a, it can be seen that the death rate increases with the increase of population density, but the overall trend is rising and tending to be stable.\n\nFrom the susceptibility rate curve in Figure 4b, it can be seen that the change in population density has little influence on the susceptible population, and the susceptibility will first decrease and then reach a stable value when the population density is large.\n\nFrom the infection rate curve in Figure 4c, it can be seen that the change in population density has little influence on the infected population. When the population density is large, the number of members of the infected population is greater, but the general trend is rising first, then falling, and finally tends to be stable.\n\nFrom the immunization rate curve in Figure 4d, it can be seen that the change in population density has little influence on the immune population. When the population density is large, the immunity first rises and then reaches a stable value.\n\nAccording to the above analysis, it is known that when the population density is large, the spread rate of infectious diseases is faster.\n\nAll things being equal, the ratio of males to females was 4:1. The parameters of two simulations for the SLIRDS model were set as follows:\n\n(1) The influence coefficients of infectious disease on males and females were 0.1 and 0.9, respectively.\n\n(2) The influence coefficients of infectious disease on males and females were 0.9 and 0.1, respectively.\n\nTwo simulation results are shown in Figure 5.\n\nAs shown in Figure 5a, we can see that when infectious diseases have a greater influence on males, the number of deaths is higher, but the overall trend is rising and gradually stable.\n\nAs shown in Figure 5b, we can see that infectious diseases have less influence on susceptible population under different influence coefficients; when infectious diseases have a greater influence on females, the number of members of the susceptible population first decreases and then reaches a stable value.\n\nAs shown in Figure 5c, we can see that infectious diseases have less influence on infected population under different influence coefficients; when infectious diseases have a greater influence on males, the number of members of the susceptible population first decreases and then reaches a stable value. However, the overall trend is first rising and then falling, and finally tends to be stable.\n\nAs shown in Figure 5d, we can see that infectious diseases have less influence on recovered population under different influence coefficients; when infectious diseases have greater influence on males, the number of members of the susceptible population increases first, and then reaches a stable value.\n\nAccording to the above analysis, it is known that in cities with more males than females, when the infectious disease has a great influence on males, infectious diseases have a greater influence on the population because of the large population base of males. Similarly, there are corresponding phenomena in cities with more females than males.\n\nAccording to related materials [24], the influence coefficient of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) on males and females is very different. In simulation experiments, the influence coefficients of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) on males and females were set to gm=0.55,gf=0.35, respectively. The parameters of two simulations for the SLIRDS model were set as follows:\n\n(1) The ratio of males to females is 4:1.\n\n(2) The ratio of males to females is 1:4.\n\nTwo simulation results are shown in Figure 6.\n\nFrom the death curve in Figure 6a, we can see that when the number of males is large, the number of deaths is higher, but the overall trend is rising and gradually stable. \n\nFrom the susceptibility curve in Figure 6b, we can see that under different sex ratios, infectious diseases have little influence on susceptible population. When the number of females is large, the number of members of the susceptible population first decreases and then reaches a stable value.\n\nFrom the infection curve in Figure 6c, we can see that under different sex ratios, infectious diseases have little influence on the infected population. When the number of males is large, the number of members of the infected population decreases first and then reaches a stable value.\n\nFrom the immunization curve in Figure 6d, we can see that under different sex ratios, infectious diseases have little influence on the immunization population. When the number of males is large, the number of members of the immunization population increases first, and then reaches a stable value. \n\nAccording to the above analysis, it is known that when the number of males is larger in the cities where infectious diseases affect men more, infectious diseases have a greater influence on the population.\n\nDue to factors such as mobility and spatial environment, age structure of the population presents different distributions. The age structure of a city can be divided into three types: young, adult, and aged according to the proportion of children, adolescents, youth, middle-aged people, and elderly people.\n\nAccording to related materials [24], the influence coefficient of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) on children, adolescents, youth, middle-aged people, and elderly people is very different. In simulation experiments, the influence coefficients of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) on children, adolescents, youth, middle-aged people, and elderly people were set to f1=0.65, f2=0.58, f3=0.46, f4=0.37, f5=0.68, respectively.\n\nAll things being equal, the parameters of three simulations for the SLIRDS model were set as follows:\n\n(1) Young: children: adolescents: youth: middle age: old age = 0.025:0.05:0.5:0.4:0.025.\n\n(2) Adult: children: adolescents: youth: middle age: old age = 0.2:0.2:0.3:0.25:0.15.\n\n(3) Aged: children: adolescents: youth: middle age: old age = 0.1:0.05:0.05:0.2:0.6.\n\nThree simulation results are shown in Figure 7.\n\nThe death, susceptibility, infection, and immunization curves are shown in Figure 7a\u2013d, respectively. It can be seen that the number of deaths in the aged cities is the largest. The number of young urban deaths is only inferior to that of the aged cities, whereas the number of deaths in the adult cities is the least. However, the overall trend of change is gradually stable after rising for all types of cities. The difference in age structure of the population has little influence on the susceptible population, and the number of members of the susceptible population in adult cities decreases first and then reaches a stable value. The difference in age structure of the population has little influence on the infected population. The number of members of the infected population in the aged cities is the highest, but the general trend is rising first and then decreasing for all types of cities. The difference in age structure of the population has little influence on the immunization population, and the number of immune individuals in the adult city rises first to then reach a stable level.\n\nAccording to the above analysis, it is known that infectious diseases spread more slowly in adult cities than in aged and young cities, but the resistance of young cities to infectious diseases is slightly greater than that of aged cities.\n\nIn this paper, we used the idea of a sparse matrix to add population density, sex ratio, and age structure factors into the SLIRDS model. Population density was set to 1 and 0.8, respectively. All things being equal, with the increase of population density, infectious diseases spread faster, and infectious diseases have a greater influence on the population. When analyzing the influence of sex ratio on the spread of infectious diseases, we considered two factors, namely, different influence coefficient and different sex ratio. First, the ratio of males to females was set to 4:1. Because of the large population base of males, infectious diseases have a greater influence on the population when the infection coefficient is greater. Second, the influence coefficients of infectious diseases on males and females were 0.9 and 0.2, respectively. Because infectious diseases have a greater influence on males, when the number of males is larger, the influence of infectious diseases on the population is greater. When analyzing the influence of age structure on the spread of infectious diseases, we simulated three types of population distribution structure, namely, young, adult, and aged, according to the age structure distribution ratio. The number of members of the infected population and deaths in the aged cities were the largest, and the susceptibility of adult cities to infectious diseases was stronger. That is, the uniform distribution of age plays a more active role in the spread of infectious diseases.\n\nIn order to effectively prevent the spread of infectious diseases in the population, we offer three suggestions according to the three influencing factors. (1) Population density: the regional economy should be balanced, the large-scale turnover of personnel should be reduced, the density of urban population should be controlled, the population in densely populated areas such as schools should be evacuated during the epidemic period of infectious diseases. (2) Sex ratio: when infectious disease has a greater influence on a certain sex, or if the sex ratio is larger in the population, attention should be paid to prevention and treatment with respect to that sex. (3) Age structure: the age structure should be optimized and the age structure of the city should be stabilized. On this basis, we should pay attention to prevention and treatment with respect to disadvantaged groups (such as the elderly and children) in the spread of infectious diseases.\n\nMany factors affect the spread of infectious diseases. This paper only studied the influence of the above three factors on the spread of infectious diseases. The many factors that must be further explored in the future include the following: first, the influence of population activity on the spread of infectious diseases; second, the influence of population size on the spread of infectious diseases; and third, in view of the analysis of the influence factors, how to implement effective prevention and control measures against the spread of infectious diseases in specific cities.\n\nIn order to study the main factors that affect the spread process of infectious diseases, the SLIRDS model was proposed in this paper. Combined with cellular automata, an epidemic model based on cellular automata was established. In the simulation experiment, the influence of population density, sex ratio, and age structure on infectious disease spread was analyzed by comparing the results with those from the actual spread process of pandemic influenza A (H1N1), and the accuracy of the SLIRDS model was confirmed.\n\nWith research on the spread of infectious diseases, the advantage of using cellular automata to model complex problems can be used to optimize epidemic models. The system can better analyze the factors affecting the spread of infectious diseases, and provide better theoretical support for the prevention and control of infectious diseases.\n\nBecause cellular automata cannot reflect every individual\u2019s and their neighbors\u2019 randomness, there was a lack of individual randomness in the SLIRDS model for the maximum peak of each state for the different durations. This will be the direction that we take in the future to focus on improvement."}
