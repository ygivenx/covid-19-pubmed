{"title": "Short Title: Mechanism of HCMV gB vaccine-mediated protection 6 7", "body": "2 Abstract:\n\nHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common congenital infection worldwide, frequently 28 causing hearing loss and brain damage in afflicted infants. A vaccine to prevent maternal 29 acquisition of HCMV during pregnancy is necessary to reduce the incidence of infant disease.\n\nThe glycoprotein B (gB) + MF59 adjuvant subunit vaccine platform is the most successful 31 HCMV vaccine tested to-date, demonstrating approximately 50% efficacy in preventing HCMV 32 acquisition in phase II trials. However, the mechanism of vaccine protection remains unknown. \n\nThe CDC estimates that every hour, a child is born in the United States with permanent 50 neurologic disability resulting from human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection -more than is 51 caused by Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, and neural tube defects combined. A 52 maternal vaccine to block transmission of HCMV to the developing fetus is a necessary 53 intervention to prevent these adverse outcomes. The gB/MF59 vaccine is the most successful 54 tested clinically to-date, achieving 50% reduction in HCMV acquisition. This manuscript 55 establishes the function and epitope specificity of the humoral response stimulated by this 56 vaccine that may explain the partial vaccine efficacy. Understanding the mechanism of 57 gB/MF59-elicited protective immune responses will guide rational design and evaluation of the 58 next generation of HCMV vaccines.\n\nAll rights reserved.

An understanding of the gB/MF59-mediated protection is needed to rationally-design 88 immunogens that will improve upon the partial vaccine efficacy that was achieved clinically. \n\nTo identify possible mechanisms accounting for the partial protection against HCMV 106 infection following gB/MF59 vaccination, we undertook an in-depth investigation into the 107 characteristics and functionality of the antibody responses elicited by this gB subunit vaccine.\n\nAs other groups have reported, we observed that gB/MF59 vaccine-elicited antibodies mediated 109 limited neutralization. Here we report on our observations that gB/MF59 vaccination results in 110 an antibody profile quite distinct from that observed in the setting of natural HCMV infection.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Most notably, there was a negligible AD-2 site 1 response elicited by 168 vaccination, which is known to be a target of potent gB-specific neutralizing antibodies (42) (AD-169 2 site 1 median log 10 MFI: gB/MF59=2.68, SP=3.69; p<0.001, Saittertherwaite t test).\n\nFurthermore, vaccination resulted in dominant IgG response against the non-neutralizing AD-3 171 epitope located in the gB protein cytodomain (AD-3 median log 10 MFI: gB/MF59=5.23, SP=4.14; 172 p<0.001, pooled t test), comprising 76% of the linear gB IgG response in vaccinees compared 173 to 32% in chronically HCMV-infected individuals (Fig. S2A ,B,F)\n\nIgG subclass distribution and binding to membrane-associated gB.\n\nGiven the poor neutralizing antibody responses observed, we sought to investigate whether The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

There was a reduced magnitude of phagocytosis activity directed against the 220 gB ectodomain in comparison to the full gB protein. Furthermore, there was no observable 221 difference in gB ectodomain-directed phagocytosis activity between vaccinees and SP 222 individuals (median % phagocytosing cells: gB/MF59=24.8, SP=18.6; p=ns, pooled t test),\n\nsuggesting that a proportion of the phagocytosis-mediating antibodies measured in vaccinees 224 target cytodomain epitopes likely not exposed on the surface of an HCMV virion or infected cell. \n\nAssay correlation matrix.\n\nLastly, we sought to investigate the relationship between measured antibody responses by 239 creating a correlation matrix (Fig. 6) . We observed two distinct clusters of responses that 240 appeared related to one another. The first cluster is comprised of gB-specific phagocytosis 241 activity (of both gB protein and whole HCMV virions), binding responses against free gB protein 242 and membrane-associated gB, and gB-specific IgG1 and IgG3 subclass responses.\n\nNeutralization activity, by contrast, was associated with a distinct alternate cluster, with robust 244 correlations observed between the different viral strains and cell lines tested.

Finally, some epitope-specific responses correlated with antibody function, including 247 gB domain II-specific IgG responses with phagocytosis activity and AD-2 and domain I-specific 248 IgG responses with neutralization activity. Of note, the formation of cluster 1 was primarily 249 driven by gB-elicited immune responses following vaccination, while cluster 2 was primarily 250 driven by binding and neutralization against non-gB CMV glycoprotein epitopes (Fig. S4A,B) .\n\nAll rights reserved.

Indeed, an average of 76% of the total vaccine-elicited linear gB 284 IgG binding was directed against this single region, in contrast to 32% in seropositive 285 individuals. Because the AD-3 region is intracellular when gB is expressed on a cell membrane,\n\nit presumably does not give rise to antibodies that can bind to or neutralize infectious virus (50).\n\nIt is unclear whether AD-3-directed antibody responses contributed to vaccine-mediated 288 protection through mechanisms that remain to be defined, or, alternatively, whether this \n\nOne limitation of this study is that we did not assess the role of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells in 337 gB/MF59 vaccine-elicited functional immunity, as stored mononuclear cells are not available. \n\nAll rights reserved.
