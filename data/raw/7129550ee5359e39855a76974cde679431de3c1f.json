{"title": "Determination of affinities of a panel whole enveloped (influenza A) virions resonance of IgGs and Fabs for using surface plasmon", "body": "Despite the widespread use of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in the study of virus-antibody ' Current address: Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, Hepatitis Virus Section, NIH, NIAID, Bethesda, MD 20892-0740, USA. interaction, whole virus particles are not commonly used, and there is only one published example where antibody affinity measurements have been made with whole virus particles (tobacco mosaic virus: TMV) as the antigen (Pellequer and Van Regenmortel, 1993) . No-antibody-affinity data have been published before for whole enveloped virus particles. The applications of SPR to virology were first highlighted (Dubs et al., 1991 , D.J. Schofield, NJ. Dimmock /Journal of' Virological Methods 62 (1996 33-42 1992) when it was shown that interactions between antibodies and a number of animal viruses particles (vaccinia virus, poliovirus) and plant viruses (TMV and cowpea mosaic virus) could be studied in real time. However, most virological studies with SPR use subvirion ligands. SPR work falls into four categories.\n\n(1) Epitope mapping using human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-l) gp120 and gp160 (VanCott et al., 1992 (VanCott et al., , 1994 Lucey et al., 1993) ; transmissible gastroenteritis virus S (spike) protein (Godet et al., 1994) ; type A influenza virus neuraminidase (N9) (Gruen et al., 1994) ; infectious pancreatic necrosis virus VP2 (Tarrab et al., 1995) ; bovine rotavirus VP6 (Tosser et al., 1994) ; and turnip mosaic virus coat protein (Kantrong et al., 1995) . (2) Interactions of viral components with antibody in relation to neutralization including the use of surrogate antigens, such as purified viral protein, viral peptides and anti-idiotype antibodies instead of whole virus. The majority of data relate to HIV-l and its surface proteins: gp120 (Richalet et al., 1994; VanCott et al., 1994; Roben et al., 1994; Burton et al., 1994) and gp41 (Conley et al., 1994; Mani et al., 1994) , and also peptide T which blocks gpl20-CD4 binding (Ramsdale et al., 1993) . Mouse hepatitis coronavirus has also been studied, but functional affinity data for IgG, F(ab')2 and Fab were obtained using an anti-idiotype mAb as a surrogate viral antigen (Lamarre and Talbot, 1995) . (3) Screening of combinatorial Fab fragments prior to neutralization studies using HIV-l gp120 (Ditzel et al., 1995; Roben et al., 1994; Barbas III et al., 1994; Burton et al., 1994) and respiratory syncytial virus F glycoprotein (Barbas III et al., 1992; Lounsbach et al., 1994) . (4) Cell receptor-virus interactions using human rhinovirus serotype 3 with ICAM-(CD54) (Casasnovas and Springer, 1995) and HIV-l gp120 with soluble CD4 (Brigham-Burke et al., 1992) . Viral peptides, recombinant viral proteins and purified viral proteins offer convenient ways of determining antibody affinity values. However, the structure, conformation and interrelationship between such subunits and whole virus particles is likely to differ. Antibody affinities obtained using viral subunits as antigens may give misleading data as there are differences in antigen conformation and density/accessibility of epitopes compared to whole virions. The importance of studying virus-antibody interactions in a manner that is as close to the in vivo situation as is possible has been highlighted recently as differences between the monomeric and oligomeric forms of the envelope protein of HIV-l have been found (Sattentau and Moore, 1995; Moore et al., 1995) .\n\nSPR is an optical phenomenon which permits biomolecular interactions to be monitored in real time and without the need to label the interacting components (Pharmacia BIAtechnology Note 101). SPR arises when light illuminates a thin conducting film under certain conditions. The interaction between electromagnetic vectors in an incident light beam and surface plasmons (free electron constellations in the conducting film) results in a resonance (Welford, 1991) . Total internal reflection produces an evanescent wave which is propagated away into the medium of lower refractive index. SPR arises if the interface is coated with a thin conducting layer (in the Pharmacia Biosensor BIAliteTM instrument this is gold). The resonant coupling between the incident light energy and the surface plasmons in the film occurs at a specific angle of incident light. The light energy is absorbed and this causes a drop in the light intensity for this angle. The incident light is focused on the surface as a wedge, and such a drop in intensity at the resonance angle shows up as a shadow in the light wedge that is reflected off the conductor surface. This resonance angle is sensitive to the refractive index of the medium into which the evanescent wave is propagated. The evanescent wave decays exponentially with increasing distance from the interface (Kovacs, 1982) thus for BIAliteTM the maximum distance for detection is 300 nm, i.e. in theory it is suitable for most virus particles. Biomolecular interactions occurring at the sensor surface cause a change in mass which affects the refractive index providing it is within the range of the evanescent wave, thus allowing SPR to be used to monitor such interactions.\n\nHere we present for the first time SPR data derived with whole enveloped (influenza type A) virus particles, from which we have determined the functional affinities of five influenza A virus HA-specific monoclonal IgGs and their Fab fragments. The system should be valuable for the study of ligands binding to other enveloped virions, including HIV-1.\n\nInfluenza A/fowl plague/Restock/34 (H7Nl) (FPV/R) was grown in the allantoic cavity of 10 day old embryonated chickens' eggs (J.K. Needle and Co., Goffs Oak) and incubated for 20 h at 35\u00b0C. Allantoic fluid was clarified by low speed centrifugation and stored at -70\u00b0C. The infectivity was determined by plaque assay on MDCK cell monolayers under 0.9% agar (Difco) in 199 medium containing 100 U/ml penicillin (Sigma), 100 pg/ml streptomycin (Sigma) and 5% (v/v) foetal calf serum (Gibco). Monolayers were incubated for 4 days at 37\u00b0C before staining with 0.015% crystal violet (BDH) in PBS.\n\nVirus was purified from allantoic fluid by differential centrifugation at 4\u00b0C (Kelly and Dimmock, 1974) . Pelletted virus was loaded onto a lo-45% (w/v) linear sucrose gradient in PBS and centrifuged at 60 000 x g for 90 min (Beckman) and the visible band harvested. Virus was stored at -70\u00b0C. Infectivity was UV-inactivated for safety reasons before use.\n\nThe hybridoma cell lines for the mouse anti-H7 HA monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) HC2 (site A, IgG2a), HC3W (site D, IgG2b), HClO (site B, IgG2a), HC58 (site D, IgG2a) and HC61 (site D, IgG2a) (Sugrue et al., 1990) were provided by A.R. Douglas and J.J. Skehel (National Institute for Medical Research, London). All were cultured in RPM1 1640 with sodium bicarbonate buffer, supplemented with 0.02 mM glutamine (Flow), 10% (v/v) foetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 pg of streptomycin. Only serum containing negligible amounts of protein A-binding bovine proteins was used in order to avoid contaminating the mAbs. Tissue culture supernatants were stored at -20\u00b0C. MAbs were purified on protein A-oxirane beads (Sigma), and protein concentrations determined using the Bio-Rad dyebinding assay, and a mouse IgG calibration curve. All mAbs neutralized virus infectivity and inhibited haemagglutination of chicken red blood cells.\n\nFab fragments were produced using immobilised papain (Sigma). Purified IgG (1 mg/ml), was incubated with 6.2 ~1 fresh 1 .O M cysteine (Sigma) and 20 ~1 of 20 mM EDTA, 2 U of agarose-immobilised papain, and 200 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.5) for 4 h at 37\u00b0C in a shaking water bath. The reaction was stopped by centrifuging out the immobilised papain, and 100 ~1 of 47 mM iodoacetamide added, and the mix returned to pH 8.0 by the addition of Tris/HCl. A sample was electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel to confirm the presence of Fab, and stained with the highly reactive colloidal Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 (Sigma: Neuhoff et al., 1988) . Any undigested IgG and Fc were removed by repeatedly passing the Fabs through a protein A column. The Fabs were then dialysed against PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C and concentrated. The protein concentration is then determined as before. The final Fab preparation was analysed by PAGE gel and colloidal Coomassie brilliant blue G250 staining for contaminating IgG. Polypeptide bands could be detected visually down to 5 ng per band. All Fabs contained < 0.5% IgG.\n\nVirus was titrated by doubling dilutions in 96 well U-bottomed microtitre plates (Greiner), in 100 ~1 vols, using 0.13% chicken red blood cells (Seralab). This concentration of red cells is lower than normally used and increases sensitivity about lo-fold. The 50% agglutination end point (1 haemagglutination unit: HAU) was estimated by interpolation between complete agglutination and no agglutination. Each HAU of purified virus contains about lo6 particles and 0.3 ng protein.\n\nFor the real-time kinetic analysis of IgG and Fab with whole virus particles, a double antibody sandwich was used in which antibody 1 was covalently coated to the sensor surface. This was used to capture whole virus particles to which the IgG or Fab to be measured (antibody 2) were bound. After each measurement the sensor chip was regenerated with a pulse of ammonium hydroxide which removed the virus plus antibody 2, but left antibody 1 in place. The cycle could then be repeated.\n\nThe gold-coated sensor chip CM-5 is itself coated with a carboxylated dextran polymer matrix and proteins were amine-coupled to it. Car-boxy1 groups on the dextran layer are activated with 35 ~1 of a 50:50 (v/v) solution of N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) and N-ethyl-N'-(3-diethy-1aminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), at a flow rate of 5 pl/min. The injection loop was washed with 300 ~1 HBS (BIA-certified HEPES, NaCl, pH 7.4) before addition of 35 ~1 mAb HClO (antibody 1) at 30 ,ug/ml in 10 mM acetate (pH 4.8) with a flow rate of 5 pl/min. The injection loop was washed with HBS and the remaining active binding sites on the chip blocked by the addition of 35 ~1 of ethanolamine hydrochloride. Purified influenza virus (87 HAU in 35 ~1 HBS) was injected for capture at a flow rate of 5 pl/min. The injection loop was then washed with 300 ,ul HBS and the baseline left to stabilise for at least 300 s before any injections of IgG or Fab (antibody 2).\n\nMeasurements were made for at least three protein concentrations. Antibody 2 (35 ~1) was injected and passed over the virus captured on the chip at a flow rate of 5 pl/min. HBS was then passed over the chip at 5 ,ul/min, and the dissociation curve was followed for at least 800 s. After the dissociation phase, the captured antibody was regenerated with a 10 ~1 pulse of 0.1 M ammonium hydroxide (pH 11.5) at a flow rate of 5 pl/min. The baseline was allowed to stabilise for at least 300 s before further use. The SPR detector is the Pharmacia Biosensor BIAliteTM instrument. The refractive index for proteins is proportional to the mass of the protein, and there is little variation between protein species. The change in refractive index is monitored with time, and represented as a sensorgram. The y-axis of the sensorgram is the resonance signal (in resonance units: RU). Binding of antibody 2 to the captured virus was analysed using the BIAevaluation software package (~2.1). The rate of antibody 2 dissociation (kJ was calculated from the dissociation curve and this rate was incorporated into the determination of the rate of antibody 2 association (k,) along with antibody 2 concentration (M). The equilibrium dissociation constant (&,,,J is k&L.\n\nMAb HClO was chosen for capturing virus. It bound virus effectively and could be regenerated at high pH, thus allowing the chip to be reused. The latter was critical as the binding of some mAbs to virus was not reversed under these conditions (Schofield and Dimmock, 1996; unpublished data) . The sensorgram for the immobilisation of HClO is shown in Fig. 1 . The capture of virus, the binding of antibody 2 (HC2) and its dissociation, and the regeneration of the HClO ligand with a pulse of ammonium hydroxide which dissociated the virus and any HC2 associated with it is shown in Fig. 2 , while Fig. 3 shows the capture of virus following five successive regeneration cycles. The mean of virus bound was 456 k 21 RU, giving a coefficient of variation of 4.7%.\n\nThe experimentally determined rate constants (k,, and kc,), calculated equilibrium dissociation constant (K,,,,,,,,, . ), isotype and antigenic site are shown in Table 1 . The association rate constants (k,,) had a 5.2-fold range from 1.7 to 8.8 x 10' M-~' s ' which gave a rank order of HC2 > HC3W > HC61 > HClO. The dissociation rate constants (k,,) had a 3.3-fold range from 1.5-5.0 x 10 4 s _ ' giving a rank order of HC61 > HC2 > HC3W > HClO. There was thus no precise correlation between k, and krh but the differences between the IgGs with respect to either parameter were small. The calculated equilibrium dissociation constant (K,r,.,5,J ranged from 0.98 to 14 x 10 ~~' M, with a rank order of HC2 > HC61 > HC3W > HClO. However the first three varied by only 2.8-fold, while there was a 16fold difference between HC2 and HClO. K,,,V,,. is the reciprocal of K ',,, ~c,,~ Rate constants were determined for HC2, HC3W and HC61 Fab fragments (Table 1) . No data were obtained for HC 10 Fab. The k,, values ranged by 2.9-fold from 1.3 to 3.7 x lo5 M ' S ~ ', with a rank order of HC2 > HC3W > HC61. HC2 was also the most active IgG. The k,, values ranged by 1.9-fold from 3.2 to 6.0 x 10 p4 s ' with a rank order of HC61 > HC2 > HC3W, exactly the same as the IgGs. KC,,,,,,,, values ranged by 9-fold from 3.1 to 28 x 10 ' M with a rank order of HC2 > HC61 > HC3W. exactly the same as the IgGs. (Dubs et al., 1992) first used the double antibody sandwich for measuring virus-antibody interactions. This was a valuable innovation for the BIAliteTM system where traditionally small antigens are coated to the sensor chip, and the association/dissociation of larger molecules (e.g. antibodies) is detected. Here we have used IgG to capture a 120 nm diameter influenza A virus particle (Taylor et al., 1987) and monitored the association/dissociation of a 9-15 nm long IgG (Nisonoff et al., 1975) , and a 7 nm long Fab fragment (Porta et al., 1994) . Despite the relatively large size of these virions, the distance from the sensor surface is still within the 300 nm maximum detection distance defined for the BIAliteTM system. Thus this is the first time that whole enveloped virus particles have been used to study ligand binding in conjunction with SPR, although (Lamarre and Talbot, 1995) admit having tried and failed with murine hepatitis virus. In all only a few non-enveloped virions have been used in antibody binding studies and epitope mapping (see Section l), although it would seem that whole virus particles in the flow cell of the BIAliteTM system closely mimics the in vivo situation where antibodies in solution pass over virus particles attached to cell receptors. We found considerable variability in the kinetic data, mainly in the association phase. The coeffi- cient of variation (CV) from a mean of three determinations ranged from 16.1 to 67.0%. However, other published data, where given, show a similar CV, e.g. 8.7 to 43.1% for antibody fragments binding to anti-idiotype antibody (Lamarre and Talbot, 1995) , 2.0 to 97.0% for recombinant human antibodies to self antigens (Griffiths et al., 1993) , 6.0 to 13.0% for ICAM-binding to human rhinovirus serotype 3 (Casasnovas and Springer, 1995), and 0.5 to 11.4% for recombinant Fabs to HIV-l gp120 (Ditzel et al., 1995) . It may be that the high CV found here was due to the complex nature of the system under examination, i.e. virus particles possessing a potential 3000 binding sites for antibody on 1000 densely packed HA spikes (Taylor et al., 1987) . In contrast protein or peptide capture antigens will be uniformly distributed on the sensor surface, and usually have only one epitope per molecule for the applied ligand.\n\nThe differences in K~i,~su~, values between the IgG and its Fab determined here with whole virions ranged from only 3 to IO-fold, and are similar to those recently reported for mAbs to the gp120 protein of HIV-l (Cavacini et al., 1994; Burton et al., 1994; Barbas III et al., 1994) and the S protein of murine hepatitis virus (Lamarre and Talbot, 1995) . These recent studies show relatively small differences in functional affinity between IgG and Fabs, although only Cavacini et al. (1994) used native protein. This is in contrast to anti-dinitrophenol (DNP) IgG, purified from serum which neutralized bacteriophage conjugated with DNP, as its Fabs had up to lOOO-fold less functional affinity than the IgG for the DNPphage complex (Hornick and Karush, 1972; Blank et al., 1972) . Differences in rate constants and equilibrium constants between the IgGs and their Fabs have been ascribed to the bivalent interac- tion of igG versus the monovalent binding of Fab (Cavacini et al., 1994; Lamarre and Talbot, 1995) . However for mAbs of very high affinity, bivdlent binding may have an insignificant effect on functional affinity, and Parham (1983) suggested that a loss of bivalency became significant only at a Ku,FsoL., of < lOa M -'. This may account for the large differences in affinity between IgG and Fab seen by Hornick and Karush (1972) and Blank et al. (1972) as the association constants for the IgGs examined were around 10' M ' On the other hand the BIAliteTM system may favour monovalent binding by preventing its conversion to bivalent binding. Dissociation of antibody would then probably result in its removal from the flow cell, if it was unable to bind to another immobilised virus on the sensor surface. Alternatively a small proportion of the IgG molecules may be binding biva-lently while most are binding monovalently. The slight differences observed between IgG and Fab would then be due to the slower dissociation of bivalently bound IgG in a background of faster dissociating monovalently bound IgG. Using the BIAliteTM system Malmborg et al. (1992) saw a slightly biphasic dissociation curve for IgG, but not for Fab, which they attributed to bivalent interaction with the antigen (tetanus toxoid) on the sensor chip. However, dissociation of the antigen was monophasic in both cases when Fab or IgG was coated to the sensor chip. It has been suggested (Malmborg et al., 1992 ) that a mixture of bi-and monovalently bound IgG would give a biphasic dissociation curve. In the system described here the rate of dissociation of all the mAbs was slow, and it was not possible to assess if the dissociation curves were mono-or biphasic. Under conditions which were adequate for the other IgGs and Fabs, no data could be obtained for HC58 IgG and its Fab, or HClO Fab. This was unexpected as the K,,,,,., of HC58 by affinity ELISA was comparable with the best of the others, and 28-fold higher than HClO which could be assayed by SPR (Schofield and Dimmock, 1996) . However, our model for the binding of HC58 IgG/Fab proposes that antibody molecules are orientated at around 90\" to the HA, so that the bulk of the IgG lies between HA globular heads and parallel with the surface of the virion, whereas other IgGs bind at about 180\" to the extremity of the HA (Schofield and Dimmock, unpublished data) . The necessity to interdigitate at right angles with the HA might make it difficult for the IgG to access its epitope in a flow cell, and might account for the failure of HC58 IgG or its Fab to bind to virions. HClO had the highest K,,,v ,,,, L', (lowest affinity) of the mAbs studied here and it seems likely that its Fab would have an even lower affinity as did all the other mAbs. This may have taken the affinity below the threshold for detection in the SPR system. Coincidentally, the K,,s,,,,, of mAb HClO (7.1 x lo8 M-') is close to the value which Parham (1983) suggested would be associated with a major reduction in affinity on conversion of the bivalent IgG to the monovalent Fab.\n\nThe rankings for the K~i.Y,Yoc, values determined for our IgGs by the BIAliteTM and ELISA meth- Schofield and Dimmock (1996) . \"Indicates that the SPR K,,,,,. values were higher than the ELISA K,,,,,,, values, and hence that the affinity values measured in the SPR system were lower.

Kdissor, values for IgG determined in the BIAliteTM system were higher (i.e. more dissociation) than those determined by the ELISA method, by 2-fold for HC2, to lo-fold for HClO. A similar situation was reported previously (Malmborg et al., 1992) for the binding of tetanus toxoid to IgG and Fab using the BIAliteTM and affinity ELISA systems. In our BIAliteTM system IgG and Fab k, values were of the same order of magnitude, while the Fabs had k,, values approximately 2-fold higher than their IgGs. K,,,,,,,. , values of Fabs were from 3-to IO-fold higher than their IgGs (Table 1) . IgG Kc, $o( values obtained by ELISA were consistently from 2-to IO-fold lower (less dissociation) than the BIAliteTM values ( Table 2) .\n\nThe data presented here demonstrate that antibody affinity measurements can be made with a large enveloped virus by SPR. Further development and refinement of this assay system is likely to lead to the more frequent use of whole virus particles in a variety of ligand-binding studies."}
