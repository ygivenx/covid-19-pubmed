{"title": "Potent binding of 2019 novel coronavirus spike protein by a SARS coronavirus- specific human monoclonal antibody", "body": "Very recently, a novel coronavirus which was temporarily named \"2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)\" emerged in Wuhan, China [1] . As of 1 February 2020, 2019-nCoV has resulted in a total of 11,821 laboratory-confirmed human infections in China, including 259 deaths, and 132 exported cases in 23 countries outside of China (https://www.who.int/emergencies/ diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports). Currently, there is no vaccine or effective antiviral treatment against 2019-nCoV infection.\n\nBased on the phylogenetic analysis (GISAID accession no. EPI_ISL_402124) [2] , 2019-nCoV belongs to lineage B betacoronavirus and shares high sequence identity with that of bat or human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) and bat SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV) (Figure 1(a) ). In previous studies, a number of potent monoclonal antibodies against SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have been identified [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . These antibodies target the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV and SL-CoVs, which is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein and mediates the entrance to human respiratory epithelial cells by interacting with cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [8] . More specifically, the 193 amino acid length (N318-V510) receptor binding domain (RBD) within the S protein is the critical target for neutralizing antibodies [9] . Some of the antibodies recognize different epitopes on RBD; e.g. the SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies CR3014 and CR3022 bound noncompetitively to the SARS-CoV RBD and neutralized the virus in a synergistic fashion [5] . We predicted the conformation of 2019-nCoV RBD as well as its complex structures with several neutralizing antibodies, and found that the modelling results support the interactions between 2019-nCoV RBD and certain SARS-CoV antibodies (Figure 1(b) ). This could be due to the relatively high identity (73%) of RBD in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV (Figure 1(c) ). For instance, residues in RBD of SARS-CoV that make polar interactions with a neutralizing antibody m396 as indicated by the complex crystal structure [10] are invariably conserved in 2019-nCoV RBD (Figure 1(d) ). In the structure of SARS-CoV-RBD-m396, R395 in RBD formed a salt bridge with D95 of m396-VL. Concordantly, the electrostatic interaction was also observed in the model of 2019-nCoV-RBD-m396, forming by R408 (RBD) and D95 (m396-VL). This analysis suggests that some SARS-CoV-specific monoclonal antibodies may be effective in neutralizing 2019-nCoV. In contrast, the interactions between antibody F26G19 [11] or 80R [12] and the RBD in 2019-nCoV decreased significantly due to the lack of salt bridges formed by R426-D56 in SARS-CoV-RBD-F26G19 or D480-R162 in SARS-CoV-RBD-80R, respectively. Furthermore, while most of the 80R-binding residues on the RBD of SARS-CoV are not conserved on RBD of 2019-nCoV ( Figure  1(c) ), it is unlikely that the antibody 80R could effectively recognize 2019-nCoV. Therefore, it is urgent to experimentally determine the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS-CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV.\n\nIn this study, we first expressed and purified 2019-nCoV RBD protein. We also predicted the conformations of 2019-nCoV RBD and its complex with the putative receptor, human ACE2. Comparison of the interaction between the complex of ACE2 [13] and SARS-CoV RBD and homology model of ACE2 and 2019-nCoV RBD revealed similar binding modes (data not shown). In both complexes, \u03b25-\u03b26 loop and \u03b26-\u03b27 loop form extensive contact, including at least seven pairs of hydrogen bonds, with the receptor. Notably, R426 on the forth \u03b1 helix in SARS-CoV RBD builds a salt bridge with E329 and a hydrogen bond with Q325 on ACE2. However, the arginine (R426 in SARS-CoV RBD) to asparagine (N439) mutation in 2019-nCoV RBD abolished the strong polar interactions, which may induce a decrease in the binding affinity between RBD and the receptor. Interestingly, a lysine (K417 in 2019-nCoV RBD) replacement of valine (V404 in SARS-CoV RBD) on \u03b26 formed an extra salt bridge with D30 on ACE2, which may recover the binding ability. These data indicate that the RBD in S protein of 2019-nCoV may bind to ACE2 with a similar affinity as SARS-CoV RBD does. Indeed, we measured the binding of 2019-nCoV RBD to human ACE2 by the biolayer interferometry binding (BLI) assay, and found that 2019-nCoV RBD bound potently to ACE2. The calculated affinity (K D ) of 2019-nCoV RBD with human ACE2 was 15.2 nM (Figure 1(f) ), which is comparable to that of SARS-CoV spike protein with human ACE2 (15 nM) [14] . These results indicate that ACE2 could be the potential receptor for the new coronavirus, and that the expressed 2019-nCoV RBD protein is functional [2] .\n\nNext, we expressed and purified several representative SARS-CoV-specific antibodies which have been reported to target RBD and possess potent neutralizing activities, including m396 [3] , CR3014 [4] , CR3022 [5] , as well as a MERS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody m336 developed by our laboratory [15] , and measured their binding ability to 2019-nCoV RBD by ELISA (Figure 1(e)) . Surprisingly, we found that most of these antibodies did not show evident binding to 2019-nCoV RBD. To confirm this result, we further measured the binding kinetics using BLI. An irrelevant anti-CD40 antibody was used as a negative control. Similarly, the antibody m396, which was predicted to bind 2019-nCoV RBD (Figure 1(d) ), only showed slight binding at the highest measured concentration (2.0 \u00b5M). Further studies are needed to solve the high-resolution structure of 2019-nCoV RBD and understand why it could not be recognized by these antibodies.\n\nNotably, one SARS-CoV-specific antibody, CR3022, was found to bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD as determined by ELISA and BLI (Figure 1(e,f) ). It followed a fast-on (k on of 1.84 \u00d7 10 5 Ms \u22121 ) and slow-off (k off of 1.16 \u00d7 10 \u22123 s \u22121 ) binding kinetics, resulting in a K D of 6.3 nM (Figure 1(f) ). This antibody was isolated from blood of a convalescent SARS patient and did not compete with the antibody CR3014 for binding to recombinant S protein [5] . To further elucidate the binding epitopes of CR3022, we measured the competition of CR3022 and human ACE2 for the binding to 2019-nCoV RBD. The streptavidin biosensors labelled with biotinylated 2019-nCoV RBD were saturated with human ACE2 in solution, followed by the addition of the test antibodies in the presence of ACE2. As shown in Figure 1 (g), the antibody CR3022 did not show any competition with ACE2 for the binding to 2019-nCoV RBD. These results suggest that CR3022, distinct from the other two SARS-CoV antibodies, recognizes an epitope that does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site of 2019-nCoV RBD.\n\nThe RBD of 2019-nCoV differs largely from the SARS-CoV at the C-terminus residues (Figure 1(c) ). Our results implied that such a difference did not result in drastic changes in the capability to engage the ACE2 receptor, but had a critical impact on the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies. Some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396, CR3014) that target the receptor binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, indicating that it is necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD. Interestingly, it was reported that the antibody CR3022 completely neutralized both the wild-type SARS-CoV and the CR3014 escape viruses at a concentration of 23.5 \u03bcg/ml, and that no escape variants could be generated with CR3022 [5] . Furthermore, the mixture of CR3022 and CR3014 neutralized SARS-CoV in a synergistic fashion by recognizing different epitopes on RBD [5] . These results suggest that CR3022 has the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. We expect more cross-reactive antibodies against 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV or other coronaviruses to be identified soon, facilitating the development of effective antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.\n\nNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author (s)."}
