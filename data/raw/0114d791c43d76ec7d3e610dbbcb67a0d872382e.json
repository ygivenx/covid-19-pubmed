{"title": "Viruses in Faeces", "body": "The widespread use of oral polio vaccines has made polio a clinical rarity in developed countries. When it does occur, it is almost invariably in unvaccinated persons, often after travel abroad. However, in developing countries, poliovirus continues to circulate; indeed, in some parts of the developing world the incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis may, if anything, be increasing.\n\nSince only limited space is available with which to cover the topic of faecal viruses and their syndromes, comments will be limited to points relating to the more important viruses, particularly if there have been recent developments.\n\nThe small intestine has an excellent in-built mechanism for producing large quantities of virus. In the adult it is approximately 9 metres in length but the villous infolding provides it with an extensive surface area.\n\nThere are a very large number of cells lining the villous processes and it is in these cells that virus replication generally occurs. The cells are replaced every 72 hours and it has been estimated that there are a sufficient number of cells lining the villi to cover the area of a tennis court! In view of these facts it is perhaps surprising that virologists have only in the course of the last few years begun to examine negatively stained faecal extracts for viruses by electronmicroscopy, since the techniques employed were available 20 years ago. However, virologists did not employ them to examine faecal extracts, perhaps because they thought that if viruses were implicated in acute gasitroenteiitis,the number of particles would be below the critical level for electronmicroscopy. Indeed, it was veterinary workers who blazed the trail by detecting rotaviruses in the stools of animals with acute enteritis some 4-5 years before medical virologists did among children.\n\nParadoxically many of the viruses which are excreted abundently cannot be grown, or can only be grown with difficulty in cell cultures.\n\nThe enterovirus genus consists of the polio, CoxsacKie A and \u0392 and echoviruses, all of which belong to the family of picronaviridae. These viruses are small, isometric viruses with a diameter of approximately 27 nm ( Fig. 1a However, the median age of onset was approximately 12 months and almost all children had acquired this by the age of 6. If this data is typical for the whole of India, then it can be extrapolated that at least 70 thousand children would have polio induced defects; a figure considerably in excess of the 9 thou sand reported in WHO statistics. (The figures above are annual).\n\nAs in other parts of the tropics, oral polio vaccination is not always effective! since some 10-20% of children have had a full course of oral polio vaccine.\n\nDespite the above findings, most children in developing countries have acquired immunity to polio virus by school age, most infections being sub-clinical. As with polio, most infections by other enteroviruses are mild or sub-clinical.\n\nAlthough relatively little is Known of the distribution and clinical features of infection in developing countries, studies in Uganda and in India have shown that a high proportion of children aged 3 years or less may be excreting entero viruses at any one time (DomoK, I., Balayan, U.S., Fayinka, O.A. and others, 1974; John, T.J., Christopher, S., 1975) . In temperate climates certain enterovirus sub-types predominate in a particular year. In 1980, Echo 30 was the predominat ing type of enterovirus (Communicable Disease Report, 1980) .\n\nThe accumulated data from a number of studies in which the epidemiological and clinical features of enterovirus infection were studied in temperate climates, has shown that there is an increase in the number of cases throughout the summer, peaking in autumn months. Males are more frequently infected than females (ratio 2:1). Highest attack rates occur in infancy, CNS infection (usually asymptomatic meningitis) being reported in about 20% of cases. Although infection is less common in adults aged 15-44, if they are infected, the CNS is involved more frequently (50-60% of cases). In such patients, virus can readily be isolated from the CSF.\n\nHepatitis A virus is a 27nm RNA virus ( Fig. lb) with the physico-chemical characteristics o f t y p i c a l enterovirus (Feinstone, S.N., Moritsugu Y., Shih J. W-K., and others, 1978) .\n\nHAV-speci f i *--^IgG '*%^HAV-specif ic 3 4 5 6 7\n\nWeeks after exposure Because of the wheel-like appearance, the term rotavirus was suggested for the viruses in this group [Flewett, T.H., Bryden, A.S., Davies, H.A. and others, 1974) , and this term is now accepted for official classification.\n\nRotaviruses were first identified in calves [Mebus, C.A., Underdahl, N.R., Rhodes, M.B. and others, 1969) and since then, in addition to children, rotaviruses have been detected in a large number of different animal species [Derbyshire, J.B., Woode, G.N., 1978) including such non-mammalian hosts as chickens and turkeys. Not only are rotaviruses detected in different animals morphologically identical but common antigens are shared. Thus antigens associated with the inner capsid are group specific whereas antigens associated with the outer capsid are species specific. , 1975] . Children between the ages of 6 months to 3 years are most commonly affected. Highest levels of virus are excreted between the second and fourth day of illness (up to 10^\u00b0 particles/g faeces] but a week or so after the onset of symptoms very little virus is present. However, patients with immuno deficiency disorders may experience diarrhoea and virus excretion over a period which may extend for many months (Saulsbury, F.T., Winkelstein, J.\u0391., Yolken, R.H. 1980] . Virus is pro-bably transmitted via the faeco/oral route and although some patients may experience respiratory symptoms, attempts to detect rotavirus in respiratory secretions have been unsuccessful (Goldwater, P.N., Chrystie, I.L., Banatvala, J.E., 1979] . Since very large amounts of virus are excreted in faeces, it is not surprising that hospital acquired infection occurs commonly, particu larly among children aged between 6-24 months. Infection has also been reported in newborn nurseries, but for reasons which are not clearly understood, neonatal infection is generally mild or asymptomatic (Totterdell, B.M., Chrystie, I.L., .\n\nAlthough results of studies relating to the incidence and seasonal distribution of rotavirus infection in temperate climates are broadly in agreement, results obtained from studies in developing countries show considerable variation. These may represent real differences or alternatively reflect language and other dif ficulties precluding obtaining specimens at optimum times for viral diagnosis. Nevertheless, rotaviruses have been shown to have a world wide distribution. Although it seemed possible that, as with rhinoviruses, there might be multiplic ity of serotypes, it is encouraging that approximately 25% of outbreaks of winter vomiting disease appeared to be associated with a significant rise in antibody titre to the Norwalk agent (Kapikian, A.Z., Greenberg, H.B., Cline, W.L., and others, 1978] .\n\n80-85% of children have acquired immunity to both serotypes (Yolken, R.H., Wyatt, R.G., Zissis, G., and others, 1978] .\n\nInfection has also been reported among adults and it is quite possible that as with some animal species, human adults represent the main reservoir of rotavirus infection. Although most episodes of rotavirus among adults are mild or even asymptomatic, outbreaks of rotavirus infection have been reported in such com munities as hospital personnel (von Bonsdorff, C.H., Hovi, T., Makela, P., and others, 1978] with little or no contact with children, including an outbreak in an intensive care unit (Holzel, H., Cubitt, D.W., McSwiggan, D.A., and others, 1980] as well as in patients in geriatric institutions (Cubitt, W.D,, Holzel, H., 1980; Halvorsrud, J., Grstavik I, 1980 ].\n\nWinter vomiting disease (perhaps more appropriately termed epidemic nausea and vomiting], affects all age groups and outbreaks may occur in families, schools, or more general communites. Infection usually occurs during winter and after an incubation period of 24-28 hours the illness begins suddenly with some or all of the following features: fever, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. The illness is self limiting, most patients recover within 2-3 days. There is often a high secondary attack rate, up to about one third of family or school contacts may experience similar symptoms within 24-28 hours.\n\nThe virus causing this syndrome was first detected by electron microscopy in the faecal filtrate of a patient infected as a secondary case during the outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in a primary school in Norwalk, Ohio (Kapikian, A.Z., Wyatt, R.G., Dolin, R., and others, 1972] . During this outbreak it was also shown by immune electronmicroscopy that patients developed an immune response during the course of infection. Following the discovery of the Norwalk agent, similar 25-27 nm particles were detected in faecal extracts from outbreaks of winter vomiting disease in the U.S.A., U.K. as well as other parts of the world ( Fig. 1e ] (Table 2 ] . However, cross-challenge studies in volunteers and immune electron-microscopy studies showed that not all strains are immunologically related. \n\nHowever, in contrast with adenoviruses which cause acute respiratory infection, the enteric adenovirusep which seem to be associated with acute diarrhoeal disease, can only rarely be propogated in cell culture. There is some evidence which suggests that the enteric adenoviruses may represent a separate homologous sero type quite distinct from adenoviruses which are respiratory pathogens (Kidd, A.H., Nadeley, C.F., 1980] .\n\nApart from parvovirus-like viruses other 25-30 nm particles have been detected in the stools of patients with acute diarrhoeal disease. Astroviruses are approxi mately 25-28 nm in diameter, have an entire outer edge and a star shaped surface configuration which may be 5 or 6 pointed (Madeley, C.R., Cosgrove, B.P., 1975] (Fig. 1g ]. Outbreaks of astrovirus associated diarrhoea have been reported in a children's ward affecting both children and staff, some of whom later developed an immune response (Kurtz, J.B., Lee, T.W., Pickering, D., 1977] . Oral admini stration of astrovirus-containing faecal filtrates to adult volunteers, may result in virus excretion, an immune response and the development of mild gastro intestinal symptoms (Reed, S.E., Kurtz, J.B., Lee, T.W. 1978] . Astroviruses have also been identified in the stools of lambs with diarrhoea and in calf faeces, but studies by immune electronmicroscopy suggest that the strains are not related antigenically.\n\nCaliciviruses are approximately 30 nm in diameter and have characteristic stain filled cup-like depressions on the particle's surface (Nadeley, C.R., Cosgrove, B.P., 1976] (Fig. 1h ]. Although these viruses may be present in the stools of asymptomatic children, they have also been detected in the stools of children and\n\nThe 27 nm isometric viruses of which Norwalk agent is the prototype, resemble enteroviruses morphologically. However, they have a higher buoyant density in caesium chloride (1.37 -1.4] which suggests that they may be parvoviruses. However, parvoviruses contain DNA and since the nucleic acid of Norwalk agent has not been determined, this group of viruses must for the present remain unclas sified.\n\nAlthough adenoviruses may be present in the stools of children with or without diarrhoeal disease, outbreaks of acute diarrhoeal disease both in hospital (Flewett, T.H., Bryden, A.S., Davies, H., and others, 1975] , as well as the community (Richmond S.J., Caul, E.G., Dunn, S.H., and others, 1979] , have been associated with the faecal excretion of very large amounts of adenoviruses Cubitt, \u2022., Moore, W. 1978] . Infection was also associated with the development of immune responses. Other small viruses which may have a rather extensive shaggy configuration may occasionally be detected in faecal extracts of patients with gastroenteritis. For want of a better term many wor kers call these viruses \"fuzzy wuzzies\". Whether these virus-like particles are associated with acute diarrhoeal disease has yet to be determined.\n\nCoronaviruses are important causes of severe diarrhoeal disease in pigs [trans-missible gastroenteritis) and calves, but attempts to identify their human counterpart have been unsuccessful. Thus, although coronavirus-like particles have been detected in the stools of patients with acute and chronic diarrhoea as well as asymptomatic persons CFig. 1i], there is no conclusive evidence as yet that these viruses cause acute diarrhoeal disease. It must be considered that structures resembling coronaviruses merely represent bacterial sub-structures or fragments of gut epithelium. Further studies will have to be carried out before the precise role of these coronavirus-like structures can be established."}
