{"title": "", "body": "M Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a progressive and highly fatal systemic disease of cats caused by feline coronavirus. Feline coronavirus most frequently causes inapparent enteric infection with fecal shedding of virus. Mild enteritis and diarrhea are seen rarely (see Chapter 14) . A mutation of feline coronavirus during intestinal replication enables it to infect macrophages and cause FIP. Despite its name, the lesions of FIP are widespread and not restricted to the peritoneum. Effusive and non-effusive forms of FIP occur. Since its recognition in the 1950s, FIP has been one of the most studied diseases of cats, yet a definitive diagnostic test, an effective treatment, and a reliable vaccine are lacking. With the decline in prevalence of feline leukemia virus from vaccination, FIP has become the deadliest infectious disease of cats.\n\n\u2022 Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is a single-stranded enveloped RNA virus with distinctive petal-shaped peplomers projecting from the surface. There are two serotypes of FCoV that differ in cell culture characteristics. Serotype I predominates in North America and Europe, whereas Serotype II is more closely related to canine coronavirus (CCV) and predominates in Japan.\n\n\u2022 Coronaviruses are found in many animals and are generally adapted for infecting epithelial cells of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract. FCoV is closely related to CCV, swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory virus, and some human coronaviruses. The CCV that causes enteritis and diarrhea in dogs (see Chapter 14) can infect cats and cause antibodies that crossreact with FCoV. Experimentally, CCV can cause enteritis, diarrhea, and even FIP in cats.\n\nM Key Point FIP-causing coronaviruses are genetic mutants of harmless enteric FCoV.\n\n\u2022 It was previously thought that cats were infected by two similar but distinct coronaviruses, the innocuous feline enteric coronavirus and the deadly FIP virus, but these are now considered phenotypic variants (biotypes) of the same virus. The non-mutated enterotropic FCoV typically causes a clinically inapparent infection of intestinal epithelial cells with fecal shedding of virus. During replication in the cat's intestinal tract, FCoV mutates frequently, especially in kittens, and this sporadically results in critical genetic mutations that enable FCoV to infect and replicate in macrophages.\n\nhas the potential to develop FIP if the virus mutates during replication to allow the mutated FCoV variant to infect macrophages. Viral replication in macrophages is the defining event in FIP.\n\n\u2022 Macrophages then replicate the mutated coronavirus and carry it to target tissues such as the peritoneum, pleura, kidney, uvea, and nervous system, resulting in widespread immune-mediated vasculitis, disseminated perivascular pyogranulomatous inflammation, and exudative fibrinous polyserositis. These are the characteristic lesions of FIP.\n\n\u2022 The pathogenesis involves circulating immune complexes, complement fixation, cytokine release, apoptosis of activated T lymphocytes, and vascular damage with necrosis and increased permeability.\n\nM Key Point It is not the virus that causes widespread damage in FIP. The disease is a consequence of the cat's immune reaction to the virus.\n\n\u2022 Natural immunity to FCoV is poorly understood but is presumed to be cell mediated rather than antibody mediated. Circulating FCoV antibodies can actually enhance progression of the disease.\n\n\u2022 FCoV is ubiquitous in cats worldwide. In many regions, 50% of cats are positive for coronaviral antibodies (i.e., seroprevalence). The majority of these seropositive cats represent current or past inapparent infection with non-mutated FCoV. Only some of these develop into mutated FIP-causing infections; thus, the prevalence of FIP is much lower.\n\n\u2022 The prevalence of FCoV infection is highest in cats confined in crowded groups, such as catteries, shelters, and multiple cat households, where the seroprevalence ranges from 50% to 90%.\n\n\u2022 In endemic catteries where the seroprevalence approaches 90%, most FCoV-infected cats remain healthy and only 5% develop FIP.\n\n\u2022 The seroprevalence of FCoV in free-roaming feral and stray cats is 12% to 15%. The lower prevalence is presumed to relate to less social interaction and less exposure to fecally excreted virus than cattery cats.\n\n\u2022 The seroprevalence in single-cat households is 15% or less.\n\n\u2022 In a large survey of North American veterinary teaching hospitals, FIP was diagnosed in 1 of every 200 new feline accessions. This population mostly represents sick cats seen by veterinarians.\n\n\u2022 FCoV can infect most wild felids, including the lion, cougar, cheetah, jaguar, leopard, bobcat, sand cat, caracal, serval, and lynx. Cheetahs are especially susceptible to developing FIP.\n\nM Key Point Whenever FCoV exists in a cat, so does the potential for developing FIP.\n\n\u2022 FCoV infection occurs most often in young kittens after maternal antibodies dissipate, between 6 and 16 weeks of age; thus, the infection rate is highest in catteries where kittens are raised in association with virus-excreting adult cats.\n\n\u2022 Young cats have increased risk for developing FIP.\n\nThe peak incidence for FIP is between 6 months and 3 years of age, although cats of any age can be affected.\n\n\u2022 Crowded group confinement (multicat households, purebred catteries, shelters) increases risk.\n\n\u2022 Factors intrinsic to the shelter experience increase fecal shedding of FCoV up to 1 million-fold after 1 week.\n\nM Key Point Most cats with FIP come from catteries and shelters.\n\n\u2022 Any factor that increases FCoV replication in the intestines of an infected cat will increase the probability of the virus mutating to a form that can cause FIP. Thus, viral load, stress, immune impairment, corticosteroids, surgery, and concurrent disease (e.g., feline leukemia virus or feline immunodeficiency virus) can be risk factors for FIP.\n\n\u2022 Inherited genetic susceptibility to FIP is a factor in some purebred cats and in cheetahs.\n\n\u2022 FCoV is primarily excreted in feces from cats with inapparent enteric infection. Healthy carriers often shed FCoV in their feces for at least 10 months, and some cats shed persistently for many years, possibly for life. One-third of healthy FCoV-seropositive cats are actively shedding virus. In high-density endemic catteries, up to 60% of healthy cats may be shedding virus at any given time.\n\n\u2022 FCoV is usually inactivated in 24 to 48 hours at room temperature, but the virus can survive up to 7 weeks in dried fecal debris; thus, environmental contamination with small particles of used litter is an important source of infection. Contaminated surfaces, food and water dishes, and human clothing, shoes, and hands can act as fomites. Most disinfectants and detergents easily destroy FCoV.\n\n\u2022 Transmission to uninfected cats most frequently occurs through oronasal contact with viruscontaining feces or contaminated material from the environment. Contaminated litter and dust particles deposited on the fur are ingested during normal grooming activity.\n\nM Key Point Indoor confinement in crowded groups increases exposure to large doses of infectious virus in feces in shared litter boxes.\n\n\u2022 In catteries, kittens are most frequently infected as they lose maternal-derived immunity after 6 weeks of age through contact with feces from virus-shedding adult cats. Removing kittens from contact with adult cats at 5 to 6 weeks of age prevents infection (see \"Prevention\").\n\n\u2022 FCoV can also be excreted in saliva, respiratory secretions, and urine, but these are unlikely to be important sources of infection.\n\n\u2022 Transplacental transmission is possible but uncommon.\n\n\u2022 Cats with FIP shed mostly the avirulent non-mutated FCoV, not the virulent mutated virus that causes FIP; thus, FIP itself is not directly contagious. Cats with FIP also excrete less FCoV than healthy carriers. greatest risk for developing FIP within the first 6 to 18 months after initial infection with FCoV.\n\n\u2022 This encompasses the unpredictable but often prolonged period of time it takes a carrier of the harmless, non-mutated FCoV to develop the critical viral mutation and then the time it takes the mutated virus to produce clinical disease.\n\n\u2022 The onset of clinical signs is often insidious, but occasionally it is sudden, especially in young kittens.\n\nM Key Point Chronic fluctuating fever that is unresponsive to antibiotics is a frequent early sign of FIP.\n\n\u2022 Once viral dissemination occurs and clinical illness develops, FIP is virtually always progressive and fatal. However, there is considerable variation in the duration of clinical illness before death; 3 to 6 weeks is typical, but prolonged illness exceeding 6 months can occur, as can intermittent illness punctuated by periods of remission.\n\n\u2022 For effusive FIP, the clinical course is usually acute (days to weeks).\n\n\u2022 For non-effusive FIP, the course is often chronic and insidious (weeks to months).\n\n\u2022 Cats with only ocular involvement sometimes survive for a year or more.\n\nM Key Point In cats with the effusive (wet) form of FIP, the predominant location of the inflammatory fluid is the abdominal cavity in 62%, the thoracic cavity in 17%, or both cavities in 21%.\n\n\u2022 Effusive FIP involving the peritoneal cavity causes progressive, non-painful, fluid distension of the abdomen.\n\n\u2022 Effusion is detected by palpation and percussion of a fluid wave. In the early stages, a small amount of abdominal fluid may be detected by palpation of intestinal loops that feel excessively slippery, as though the serosal surfaces are highly lubricated. Pain on palpation is infrequent.\n\n\u2022 Extension of the peritoneal inflammation may involve the gastrointestinal tract (vomiting, diarrhea), hepatobiliary system (jaundice), or pancreas (vomiting due to pancreatitis).\n\n\u2022 Scrotal swelling may occur in intact males as a direct extension of the peritoneal inflammation and effusion into the testicular tunics.\n\n\u2022 Adhesions may organize the mesentery, omentum, and viscera into an irregular, firm mass that is palpable in the cranioventral abdomen.\n\nCats with non-mutated FCoV infection of the intestinal tract infrequently develop clinical signs (see Chapter 14). This section describes the clinical manifestations of mutated, FIP-producing FCoV infection. Cats with FIP often present initially with nonspecific and nonlocalizing signs, such as fever, anorexia, inactivity, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and pallor (anemia). As the disease progresses, these signs worsen and additional clinical signs develop that indicate either body cavity effusions in the \"wet\" form of the disease or organ-specific abnormalities in the non-effusive or \"dry\" form (Table 10-1). Approximately 75% are effusive and 25% are non-effusive. Some cats manifest features of both effusive and non-effusive disease or change over time from one form to the other.\n\n\u2022 The natural incubation period is extremely variable, ranging from a few weeks to several years. Cats are at over the surface and infiltrating throughout the renal cortex.\n\n\u2022 Extensive renal involvement occasionally causes renal failure with polyuria-polydipsia and azotemia (increased blood urea nitrogen [BUN] and serum creatinine).\n\n\u2022 Proteinuria is a frequent laboratory finding in renal FIP. In addition, large quantities of circulating immune complexes may lead to subclinical glomerulonephritis with any of the other forms of effusive and non-effusive FIP.\n\n\u2022 Pyogranulomatous hepatitis (hepatomegaly, jaundice, and signs of hepatic failure) may occur in FIP.\n\n\u2022 The most consistent laboratory abnormalities are bilirubinuria and hyperbilirubinemia. Mild to moderate elevations of serum liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase) and serum bile acids also may occur.\n\n\u2022 Pyogranulomatous lesions may cause palpable enlargement of the visceral lymph nodes, spleen, or omentum.\n\n\u2022 Pyogranulomatous enterocolitis may cause diarrhea and diffuse or masslike intestinal thickening, especially in the ileocecocolonic region.\n\n\u2022 Pancreatic involvement can occasionally cause pancreatitis and, rarely, diabetes mellitus.\n\n\u2022 Ocular lesions of FIP are usually bilateral and affect the vascular tunic or uvea (uveitis). Lesions may sometimes cause blindness.\n\n\u2022 Manifestations of exudative anterior uveitis (iridocyclitis) may include miosis, aqueous flare, keratic fibrinocellular precipitates, hypopyon (\"mutton-fat\" deposits of cells and fibrin), hyphema, anterior chamber adhesions (synechia), corneal edema, and deep neovascularization of the cornea (see Chapter 136).\n\n\u2022 Chorioretinitis from posterior uveal involvement is detected by ophthalmoscopic examination and may include perivascular cuffing, exudative retinal detachment, and retinal hemorrhages (see Chapter 138).\n\n\u2022 Multifocal pyogranulomatous meningoencephalitis and myelitis are frequent in FIP. Inflammatory lesions are perivascular and often involve the meningeal and ependymal layers. In one report, 29% of cats with FIP developed neurologic signs. In a retrospective survey of 286 cats with neurologic disease, lesions indicating FIP of the CNS were found in 16%. In another large \u2022 Abdominal effusion is confirmed by radiography, ultrasonography, or abdominocentesis, and the results of fluid analysis are highly indicative of FIP (see \"Diagnosis\").\n\n\u2022 Dyspnea, tachypnea, and exercise intolerance are the major presenting signs because lung expansion is restricted by compression from fluid in the pleural space.\n\n\u2022 Cats with pleural effusion may prefer a sitting or sternal recumbent posture to facilitate breathing. Increased respiratory distress may occur with exercise, with physical restraint in the hospital, or with repositioning in lateral recumbency (i.e., orthopnea).\n\n\u2022 Thoracic effusion may cause muffled heart and lung sounds on auscultation and hyporesonance and a horizontal fluid line on thoracic percussion.\n\n\u2022 Thoracic effusion is confirmed by radiography or thoracocentesis (see Chapter 164). The results of fluid analysis are highly indicative of FIP (see \"Diagnosis\").\n\n\u2022 Pericardial effusion due to fibrinous pericarditis may occur in FIP, with or without other effusions. In one survey, FIP was the second most frequent cause of feline pericardial effusion, accounting for 14% of cases.\n\n\u2022 Pericardial effusion in FIP does not usually cause overt clinical signs. It may be suspected from auscultation (muffled heart sounds), thoracic radiography, or electrocardiography, and it is confirmed by echocardiography (see Chapter 151).\n\nM Key Point The non-effusive (dry) form of FIP is characterized by multifocal pyogranulomatous inflammation and necrotizing vasculitis in various organs, such as the abdominal viscera (e.g., liver, spleen, kidneys, pancreas, and intestines), eyes, central nervous system (CNS), and lungs.\n\nPyogranulomas appear as multiple discreet or coalescing gray-white nodular masses of variable size on the surface and within the parenchyma of affected organs. These are often mistaken for tumors. Effusion is often minimal or absent. The specific organs affected and the degree of resulting organ failure determine the presenting clinical signs.\n\n\u2022 Pyogranulomatous nephritis causes the kidneys to become palpably enlarged, firm, and irregular (\"lumpy\"), associated with pyogranulomas scattered survey, FIP was the most common spinal disease in cats.\n\n\u2022 The neuroanatomic distribution of the lesions determines clinical signs; some of the most common are ataxia, tremors, vestibular dysfunction, seizures, posterior paresis, hyperesthesia, and behavioral changes. The relentless progression and multifocal nature of the signs are characteristic features of neural FIP.\n\n\u2022 Neuropathies occasionally involve the cranial nerves (e.g., trigeminal or facial) or peripheral nerves (e.g., brachial or sciatic).\n\n\u2022 Cats with neural FIP often develop secondary hydrocephalus when the inflammatory process obstructs the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In one study of 24 cats with neural FIP, 75% had hydrocephalus. Dilatation of the ventricular and central canal system is identified on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Meningeal enhancement also is seen on MRI.\n\n\u2022 The diagnosis of neural FIP depends on CSF analysis (see the section on diagnosis).\n\n\u2022 Pyogranulomatous pneumonia can be found in cats with FIP on thoracic radiographs or at necropsy, but in most cases this is clinically silent or only causes a mild cough.\n\n\u2022 This appears radiographically as a diffuse, poorly defined, patchy or nodular interstitial pulmonary infiltrate.\n\n\u2022 Testicular enlargement caused by pyogranulomatous orchitis has been reported in FIP.\n\n\u2022 Contrary to what has been speculated in the past, FCoV is not directly associated with cattery reproductive problems, neonatal deaths, or birth of weak or \"fading\" kittens.\n\n\u2022 Non-mutated FCoV infection is characterized by persistent viral replication in enterocytes and fecal shedding of virus. Active fecal shedding of FCoV can be confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of feces (see the later section on RT-PCR assay) or by electron microscopy of feces. False negatives occur with both of these diagnostic techniques.\n\n\u2022 The quantity of fecal virus can fluctuate, so ideally feces should be checked daily for 4 to 5 consecutive days before determining a cat is a non-shedder.\n\nIntestinal Biopsy \u2022 Intestinal biopsy shows nonspecific lesions of villous tip injury, with stunting and fusion of villi.\n\n\u2022 Immunofluorescence or immunohistochemical staining for viral antigen in intestinal biopsies is confirmatory.\n\nThe diagnosis of FIP is usually suspected from clinical signs and the results of routine laboratory evaluations (see Table 10 -1). There is no single reliable confirmatory test for FIP; thus, base the clinical diagnosis of FIP on the combined results of well-chosen laboratory evaluations (e.g., hematology, serum chemistry, cytology, serology, and virology), diagnostic imaging, and histopathology (Table 10 -2).\n\nM Key Point Clinical signs and laboratory abnormalities in cats with FIP are not specific for the disease; however, collectively these may provide strong circumstantial evidence for a presumptive diagnosis of FIP.\n\n\u2022 Hematology often reveals nonspecific abnormalities reflecting the chronic inflammatory response, such as nonregenerative anemia, neutrophilic leukocytosis or leukopenia, and stress lymphopenia.\n\n\u2022 Total serum protein and serum globulins (especially gamma and alpha 2 ) are increased by the chronic immune stimulation in 70% of non-effusive cases and 50% of effusive cases, whereas serum albumin is often decreased. One study showed that a decreased serum albumin-to-globulin ratio (A/G < 0.8) indicates a high probability of FIP (92% positive predictive value); while an A/G > 0.8 suggests that FIP is unlikely (61% negative predictive value). Serum protein electrophoresis is usually not necessary.\n\n\u2022 Serum chemistries may detect involvement of abdominal organs such as the liver (increased serum liver enzymes, bilirubin, and bile acids), kidneys (increased creatinine and BUN), or pancreas (increased pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity).\n\n\u2022 Urinalysis findings may include proteinuria or bilirubinuria.\n\n\u2022 Disseminated intravascular coagulation sometimes develops in FIP, resulting in prolonged coagulation times, decreased platelets, and increased fibrin degradation products (see Chapter 23).\n\nDiagnostic imaging is useful for identifying organ sites of involvement in FIP. Imaging also facilitates procurement of diagnostic fluid or biopsy specimens.\n\nRadiography is useful for confirming abdominal or thoracic effusion, abdominal organ enlargement (e.g., kidney and liver), or pulmonary infiltration. Affected abdominal organs (liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas, intestines, omentum, and lymph nodes) also can be imaged, aspirated, and biopsied using ultrasonography.\n\nIn cats with neurologic FIP, secondary obstructive hydrocephalus is a common finding on CT and MRI scans. Contrast enhancement of the meninges and ependyma also may be seen on MRI.\n\nM Key Point Fluid analysis is usually sufficient for the clinical diagnosis of effusive FIP. The typical fluid in effusive FIP is a highly proteinaceous pyogranulomatous exudate.\n\n\u2022 FIP fluid appears clear, viscous, and straw yellow or golden. It may be tenacious or sticky and contain flecks or strands of fibrin. The fluid gets frothy when shaken because of its high protein concentration, and it may clot when refrigerated.\n\n\u2022 FIP fluid has a high protein concentration, approaching that of plasma, ranging from 4 to 10 g/dl. Effusive FIP is highly likely if the total fluid protein is more than 3.5 g/dl and the globulin portion is greater than 50%. The A/G is usually less than 0.8. A gamma globulin percentage of greater than 32% by fluid protein electrophoresis is also highly indicative of FIP. An A/G ratio of greater than 0.8, or an albumin percentage greater than 50%, indicates that a disease other than FIP is highly likely.\n\n\u2022 FIP fluid usually has a nucleated cell count ranging from 1,000 to 20,000 cells/ml, which is low compared with other exudates.\n\n\u2022 The cytologic pattern of FIP fluid is pyogranulomatous exudate. The predominant cells are well-preserved (non-degenerate) neutrophils and macrophages with variable numbers of plasma cells and lymphocytes.\n\n\u2022 Additional evaluations on effusions can include assay for anti-FCoV antibodies (see \"Coronaviral Antibody Tests\") and RT-PCR assay to detect coronaviral nucleic acid (see the later section on PCR assay). Antibody and RT-PCR assays on effusions may have higher diagnostic value than serum testing.\n\nFCoV antigen using either immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry is the most definitive confirmatory test for effusive FIP, with 100% positive predictive value (see \"Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemistry\").\n\nfrom the anterior chamber of the eye for ocular FIP have high diagnostic value. Both the protein concentration and the nucleated cell count (neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes) are increased in the CSF of most cats with neural FIP (see Table 10 -2) and in the aqueous humor of cats with intraocular FIP.\n\n\u2022 CSF and anterior chamber fluid can also be evaluated for the presence of anti-FCoV antibodies (see the following section). In FIP, the ratio of CSF or ocular antibodies to serum antibodies is generally much higher than the ratio of CSF or ocular total protein to serum total protein.\n\n\u2022 A PCR assay of CSF and anterior chamber fluid for coronaviral nucleic acid is not as useful (see the section on PCR assay).\n\nhave the combination of progressive neurologic signs (especially if multifocal), increased CSF protein and leukocytes (especially neutrophils), and hydrocephalus on imaging.\n\nTesting for coronaviral serum antibodies is informative as an epidemiological screening tool and as a diagnostic aid for FCoV and FIP if a reliable laboratory is used and the results are interpreted properly.\n\nM Key Point A positive coronaviral antibody test means only that a cat has been exposed to some coronavirus at some time.\n\n\u2022 Serology does not provide a definitive diagnosis of FIP because the antibodies in cats infected with harmless non-mutated FCoV are not distinguishable from the antibodies in cats with FIP. A large percentage of the healthy cat population is seropositive for FCoV antibodies, and most of these cats never develop FIP. In addition, seropositivity does not distinguish active from past infection.\n\n\u2022 Antibodies to the related non-FCoVs (e.g., CCV and TGEV) crossreact with FCoV antibodies, lowering specificity further.\n\n\u2022 Seroconversion after initial exposure to FCoV takes 1 to 3 weeks.\n\nnot confirm a diagnosis of FIP, and the absence of FCoV antibodies does not rule out a diagnosis of FIP.\n\n\u2022 Many commercial diagnostic labs measure FCoV-antibody titers; however, methodologies are variable; thus, results cannot be compared between labs. For example, whether a feline or non-feline viral antigen is used in the test procedure will influence the titer values that indicate the lowest and highest titer levels.\n\n\u2022 Use a reliable commercial diagnostic laboratory that measures quantitative FCoV-antibody titer levels. Avoid using rapid in-office enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests that merely report positive or negative results without titer quantification-this is less useful than titer information, and these tests give less consistent results than conventional serologic tests.\n\n\u2022 Commercially available ELISA tests for detection of antibody to the 7b gene have been marketed as \"FIPspecific tests.\" However, mutation of this gene is not specific for FIP, and this test has no advantage over conventional serologic assays.\n\n\u2022 Serum or plasma samples for FCoV antibody testing can be refrigerated or stored at -20\u221eC without affecting the test.\n\n\u2022 FCoV antibodies also can be measured in effusions, CSF, or anterior chamber fluid (aqueous). Some studies suggest that these are more diagnostically useful than serum testing but have similar interpretation pitfalls. \u2022 In healthy cats, the height of the antibody titer correlates with the virus replication rate in the intestine, the likelihood of fecal shedding, and the amount of virus shed in the feces.\n\n\u2022 In general, low titers have the least diagnostic value. \u2022 The highest measurable titer level for the assay used by the lab is highly suggestive of FIP but is still not confirmatory by itself. One study found 94% probability of FIP at the highest titer level.\n\n\u2022 Rising antibody titers are not helpful because they are seen in healthy cats with non-mutated FCoV, and titers fluctuate unpredictably in both FIP and avirulent infections.\n\n\u2022 Healthy carriers of non-mutated FCoV living in endemic cattery and multicat environments tend to have higher titers than individual pet cats; thus, high titers might be less meaningful in cattery cats. Less than 10% of cattery cats with titers ever develop FIP.\n\nM Key Point A healthy cat that is negative for antibodies is likely to be free of FCoV and thus is not shedding virus, is not infectious to other cats, and is not at risk for FIP.\n\n\u2022 False-negative test results are infrequent but occur in up to 10% of confirmed FIP cases; thus, a negative titer does not entirely rule out FIP. False-negative titers can result from low antibody levels seen with peracute infection (less than 10 days after exposure), the terminal stages of infection, or with consumption of antibody in immune complexes. A laboratory error or an insensitive assay system also explains some false negatives.\n\n\u2022 The evaluation of FCoV antibodies in effusions was found to have good predictive value for FIP (90% positive, 79% negative), suggesting that fluid testing may be more diagnostically useful than serum testing.\n\nM Key Point Interpret the RT-PCR test with other clinical findings, and do not use this as the sole basis for diagnosis of FIP.\n\n\u2022 The RT-PCR viral assay is used to detect coronaviral nucleic acid in blood, fluids, tissue, or feces.\n\n\u2022 A positive result indicates the presence of FCoV, but it does not distinguish between the mutated, FIPproducing variants and non-mutated FCoV. Viremia occurs not only in FIP but also in healthy FCoV carriers. One study found that up to 80% of cats in endemic catteries can be viremic and RT-PCRpositive, and this was not predictive of FIP. Thus, RT-PCR by itself is not a reliable confirmatory diagnostic test.\n\nM Key Point PCR assays do not distinguish between mutated and non-mutated FCoV.\n\n\u2022 In general, effusions and tissue specimens are more likely than blood to be positive in cats with FIP. Plasma is more sensitive than serum. The lowest yield is in CSF and urine, so these are not recommended for routine PCR testing.\n\n\u2022 Fecal RT-PCR can be used to document fecal shedding of FCoV, especially in healthy cats as a component of a cattery control program. Evaluate feces daily for 4 to 5 consecutive days. Retesting over several months is required to identify chronic persistent shedders.\n\n\u2022 A false-negative RT-PCR results from degradation of sample RNA and poor laboratory technique. The primers used also may not detect all strains of FCoV.\n\n\u2022 Samples for PCR require careful handling to avoid invalid results. Keep samples frozen and assay them as soon as possible for optimal results.\n\n\u2022 Histopathology is considered the \"gold standard\" for confirming FIP. Thus, biopsy of affected tissues is a valuable diagnostic procedure for identifying the distinctive FIP lesions of vasculitis and pyogranulomatous inflammation.\n\n\u2022 Coronavirus can be identified in tissue specimens by PCR, immunofluorescent antibody, and immunohistochemistry techniques (see the next section).\n\n\u2022 Staining of macrophages in tissue specimens and effusions for intracellular FCoV antigen using either immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry is the most definitive confirmatory test for effusive FIP, with 100% positive predictive value (i.e., virtually no false positives).\n\n\u2022 Do not rule FIP out when these tests are negative.\n\nFalse negatives occur frequently when there are insufficient infected macrophages in the specimen or when the viral antigen is masked by competitive binding with FCoV antibodies.\n\nM Key Point No treatment has been proved to reduce the risk of developing FIP in healthy antibodypositive FCoV carriers.\n\nTreatment has not been proved to lower the high mortality rate of FIP (>95%) or to slow progression of the disease. Various antiviral, immunomodulating, and immunosuppressive drugs have been used to treat FIP, but efficacy is highly questionable. Some cats show temporary improvement of clinical signs with supportive care and anti-inflammatory therapy using corticosteroids. The best candidates for palliative medical therapy are cats that are eating, active, and in good body condition. Spontaneous remissions occur but are extremely rare. Euthanasia is appropriate in severely affected cats with poor quality of life.\n\nM Key Point Nearly all cats with confirmed clinical FIP eventually die, regardless of treatment.\n\n\u2022 Some antiviral drugs (e.g., acyclovir and zidovudine [AZT] ) have no activity against FCoV. Other antiviral drugs (e.g., ribavirin) show in vitro activity against FCoV but are either too toxic for cats or ineffective when used clinically to treat FIP.\n\n\u2022 Ribavirin-treated kittens, for example, had more severe clinical signs and a shortened survival time compared with untreated kittens. Ribavirin also causes serious side effects of hemolysis, bone marrow toxicity, and liver toxicity in cats.\n\n\u2022 Interferons in high doses have both immunomodulating and antiviral activity (see below).\n\n\u2022 New anticoronaviral drugs under development for treatment of human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus might have future application in cats.\n\n\u2022 Immunomodulators are intended to stimulate compromised immune function. Anecdotal reports of clinical improvement with these agents have not been substantiated by controlled studies; thus, conclusive evidence of efficacy in FIP is lacking.\n\n\u2022 Nonspecific immune stimulation can theoretically potentiate the immune-mediated consequences of FIP.\n\n\u2022 Immunomodulator agents that have been used unsuccessfully to treat FIP include Propionibacterium acnes (ImmunoRegulin), thioproline (Promodulin), acemannan (Carrisyn), levamisole, and cyclosporine.\n\n\u2022 Human and feline interferons have been used to treat FIP (see below).\n\nRecombinant forms of interferon given parenterally in high doses can have both antiviral and immunomodulatory effects. Feline interferon-omega and human interferon-alpha have both been used to treat FIP.\n\n\u2022 Recombinant feline interferon-omega (rFeIFN-w) is available in Europe and Japan. To treat FIP, rFeIFNw (Virbagen Omega, Virbac) has been given at 1,000,000 U/kg SC every other day until clinical remission then once or twice weekly. Expense will be prohibitive for many owners.\n\n\u2022 In a preliminary uncontrolled study of 12 FIP cats using rFeIFN-w with prednisone (2 mg/kg PO q24h, tapered to 0.5 mg/kg q48h), 33.3% of the cats achieved complete remission for more than 2 years, 33.3% achieved partial remission but died after 2 to 5 months, and 33.3% failed to respond and died.\n\n\u2022 Parenteral high-dose human interferon-alpha (rHuIFN-a) (100,000-1,000,000 U/kg IM) does not appear to be effective in FIP, and it is unsuitable for long-term treatment because cats develop antibodies against the human protein after 3 to 7 weeks that inhibit the drug's activity.\n\n\u2022 Oral low-dose human interferon-alpha (Roferon, Hoffman-LaRoche; Intron-A, Schering-Plough) diluted to 30 U/ml and given at 30 units PO, daily for 7 days on alternate weeks, has reportedly improved appetite and well-being with minimal side effects. The rHuIFN-a given orally is destroyed by gastric acid and does not achieve systemic levels, but it may exert immunomodulating activity on oropharyngeal lymphoid tissue leading to cytokine release.\n\nSome cats transiently improve with supportive care combined with palliative medical therapy using a high dose of corticosteroid, with or without a cytotoxic alkylating agent such as chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide (Table 10 -3).\n\n\u2022 Corticosteroids and alkylating drugs have no effect on the virus, but by virtue of their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, they are aimed at controlling the widespread immune-mediated inflammatory reaction that occurs in FIP.\n\n\u2022 These drugs may adversely affect cellular immunity mediated by T lymphocytes and macrophages and thus have the potential to promote the viral infection.\n\nM Key Point Only use immunosuppressive drugs to treat overt FIP. In healthy FCoV carriers and seropositive cats, these drugs could have the unwanted effect of promoting the onset of FIP.\n\n\u2022 The principal side effects of alkylating drugs are anorexia and bone marrow suppression; thus, monitor a complete blood count periodically (see Chapter 26 for more details on the use of these drugs).\n\n\u2022 Persistent drug-induced anorexia is a frequent problem when these drugs are given daily. An alternative is pulse administration, using a large dose of the drug once every 2 to 3 weeks. In this way, a few days after each dose the appetite usually rebounds and is maintained between treatment cycles.\n\n\u2022 Regardless of the regimen chosen, if no response is noted within the first 2 to 4 weeks, consider the therapy ineffective and either modify or discontinue it. If a positive response occurs, continue the treatment indefinitely.\n\nThese measures may improve quality of life and possibly survival time.\n\n\u2022 Minimize stress as an exacerbating factor. \u2022 Perform intermittent body cavity drainage of effusion as needed to relieve dyspnea.\n\n\u2022 Give parenteral fluid therapy. \u2022 Give nutritional support (via tube-feeding techniques; see Chapter 3).\n\n\u2022 Give aspirin (10 mg/kg q72h) to inhibit platelet aggregation caused by vasculitis.\n\n\u2022 Give antibiotics as needed to control complicating bacterial infections.\n\n\u2022 Treat anterior uveitis with topical corticosteroids and atropine (see Chapter 136).\n\n\u2022 Give blood transfusions (for severe nonregenerative anemia). \u2022 The vaccine virus replicates locally in the nasopharynx and intestines but not systemically because of temperature sensitivity. It is supposed to stimulate local nasal and gut mucosal immunity, salivary immunoglobulin A antibody, and cell-mediated immunity. It does not protect against enteric FCoV infection.\n\n\u2022 The lack of proven efficacy in kittens younger than 16 weeks of age is a fundamental pitfall, because under most circumstances kittens first become infected with FCoV between 6 and 16 weeks of age.\n\n\u2022 The 2000 Report of the American Association of Feline Practioners Panel on Feline Vaccines states: \"At this time there is no evidence that the vaccine induces clinically relevant protection and its use is not recommended.\"\n\n\u2022 Various genetically engineered recombinant vaccines are under development and may become available in the future.\n\nControl of FCoV infection in catteries, shelters, and multicat households is aimed at limiting virus spread, minimizing exposure, and reducing stress. Infection with FCoV is ubiquitous, so complete eradication is rarely feasible, and even if eradication is successful, reinfection frequently occurs. Test and removal based on FCoV antibody testing is not practical since it is typical for 80% to 90% of cats in endemic catteries to be seropositive. Depopulation and starting over would be required.\n\nM Key Point Do not consider healthy FCoV antibodypositive cats to be harmless. Seropositive cats frequently shed FCoV in their feces that contaminates the environment and infects other cats, and FCoV always has the potential to mutate and cause FIP.\n\n\u2022 Be familiar with risk factors and transmission of FCoV (see \"Epidemiology\").\n\n\u2022 Use good husbandry practices (e.g., good sanitation, ventilation, and feeding practices) and limit feco-oral contamination.\n\n\u2022 Minimize overcrowding and stress. High-density housing allows a high level of fecal contamination of the environment, facilitating feco-oral spread of infection.\n\n\u2022 Control feline leukemia virus in the cattery with vaccination, testing, and removal (see Chapter 8).\n\n\u2022 Do not breed male and female cats that have a history of producing kittens that later developed FIP, because they potentially may pass on a genetic susceptibility to FIP.\n\n\u2022 The risk of infection from cat shows and breeding exchanges is considered low; however, in these situations do not allow sharing of food, water, or litter.\n\n\u2022 Only allow healthy seronegative cats to enter a coronavirus-free cattery. Ideally, before a cat can be safely mixed with other cats, confirm the absence of fecal shedding based on at least 4 consecutive negative fecal RT-PCR tests (although this may not be practical in many situations).\n\nThe greatest source of viral contamination of the environment is from small particles of fecal debris and litter that are carried throughout the facility by movement of air, animals, and people. Any contaminated material can end up on the fur and thus be ingested by the cats. Consider the following control measures to reduce the environmental virus load and to minimize exposure:\n\n\u2022 Use at least one litter box for every two cats. Locate litter boxes away from food and water bowls to avoid cross-contamination. Ensure that the area is easy to clean and disinfect.\n\n\u2022 Scoop feces from litter boxes daily, and replace litter and disinfect litter boxes as often as possible (at least weekly).\n\n\u2022 Dispose of used litter in sealed plastic bags. \u2022 Use dedicated food and water bowls for each animal, and clean and disinfect bowls regularly.\n\n\u2022 Brush the fur of cats regularly to remove contaminated fecal particles and litter that could be ingested during grooming.\n\n\u2022 Reduce cross-contamination between cats by housing cats individually or in stable small groups of four or less.\n\n\u2022 Avoid having too many kittens because they shed the greatest amount of virus.\n\n\u2022 Ideally, identify and eliminate persistent carriers that continuously shed large amounts of virus by using fecal RT-PCR tests repeated over several months.\n\nIsolation and early weaning can be effective for controlling the spread of FCoV in kittens, as well as herpesvirus and calicivirus."}
