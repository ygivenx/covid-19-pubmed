{"title": "INFECTIOUS DISEASE RESEARCH", "body": "ascitic fluids formed the basic reagents for these techniques.\n\nThere now are over 400 recognized serotypes of arboviruses and, in our own laboratory alone, over 3,000 separate stocks of seed virus, immune ascitic fluid, and antigen produced in mice.\n\nThe total investment over the past 30 years is in excess of $30,000,000. Surveillance of murine viruses has been essential to protect this investment, and prevention and control of infection with viruses indigenous to rodents has been a major problem.\n\nI shall discuss this afternoon the threats to this program and, by analogy, to other infectious disease research posed by virus infections of mice and other rodents.\n\nWe learn best from our own mistakes; I have chosen therefore to illustrate the principles of rodent virus effects on infectious disease research using examples from our own institutional experience. Many investigators have been involved in these episodes including Max Theiler, Wilbur Downs, Sonja Buckley, Gregory Tignor, Robert Tesh, Thomas Aitken, Jordi Casals, Andrew Main, Pravin Bhatt, Albert Jonas and Abigail Smith. The problems with murine viruses have been cyclic, at times terminating the work of the Arbovirus Unit for periods of months at a cost of thousands of dollars each day. The following case reports illustrate the principles.\n\nA. Acute Death of Rodents A common experience of investigators using mice in arbovirus studies is to find infant mice dying in a non-specifc manner.\n\nThis usually occurs in winter when the temperature and relative humidity are low. Often the cause of death is not found; when it is found, epizootic diarrhea of mice or sometimes mouse hepatitis virus are implicated.\n\nIn January 1971, however, it was neither of these viruses.\n\nBhatt and Jonas described the outbreak (1). The mouse facility at Yale had at that time been operated for 3 years as a closed nucleus and production colony; mice used in virus experiments were housed in additional rooms with separate air intake and exhaust. There were 950 breeding pens with average census of 366 unweaned litters. Disease was noted in both the nucleus and production colonies, as well as in the experimental mice.\n\nInvestigators found mice dying, usually those between one and two weeks of age. Not all litters were affected and not all mice in an affected litter died. Deaths occurred irrespective of whether mice were inoculated for virus assay or not. The agent was not carried by brain to brain passage in mice.\n\nThe outbreak appeared suddenly, affected from 1-5% of litters at any one time, reached its peak mortality in about 2 weeks and was over by 3 weeks.\n\nPneumonia was the major gross and histopathological finding.\n\nSeven strains of Sendai virus were recovered in BHK-21 cell cultures from lungs of mice.\n\nHI tests of retired breeders from the colony during the year before the outbreak indicated an antibody prevalence of between 4.7 and 7.7%.\n\nDuring 3 years afterward, the percentages ranged between 74.5 and 94.3%. It is not clear whether or not the low antibody prevalence before January 1971 represented non-specific HI reactions, or a low-level transmission of Sendai virus. How the virus was introduced or what conditions precipitated the rapid spread is not known.\n\nThe impact, however, was swift and severe; work stopped for a 3-week period. Sendai virus, fortunately, did not figure as a contaminant in brain passage material and the colony recovered completely.\n\nTo our knowledge the Sendai antibody did not later adversely affect the arbovirus program.\n\nMuch more insidious than colony rodent viruses which cause epizootics are those which do not kill, or kill sporadically, but which contaminate passage material. This next example, described by Bia et al. (2) , involved the diagnosis of a patient with severe encephalitis. The Arbovirus Unit and Dr. Fred Murphy at CDC were consulted in the process of arriving at a diagnosis.\n\nA 17 year old male was admitted in August 1977 to the West Haven Veterans Administration Hospital. He had returned to Waterbury, Connecticut after camping in the western part of the United States. A stormy hospital course was characterized by fever, delerium, and ankle clonus, progressing to coma. Laboratory findings included cerebrospinal fluid cell count of 250 lymphocytes and protein of 132 mg/dL.\n\nOn electroencephalogram there was prominent delta slowing in the right temporal region. A temporal lobe biopsy was done because the physician suspected herpes simplex, an infection which can only be confirmed by biopsy.\n\nThe histological diagnosis was acute viral encephalitis.\n\nMice were inoculated with the brain biopsy tissue and 11/11 died after two weeks. Reinoculation was also positive. The agent killing mice was identified as a coronavirus by electron microscopy and was shown to be mouse hepatitis virus by neutralization test. The patient received intravenous Vidarabine therapy, 15 mg/kg/day for 10 days. He recovered completely. By CF test there was a diagnostic rise in western encephalitis antibody from acute to convalescent phase and a negative reaction to the coronavirus isolate. This patient had western encephlatitis, a mosquito-borne disease occurring during the summertime in the western part of North America.\n\nThere are several lessons to be learned from this case; the lesson relevant to this discussion is that viruses isolated in laboratory rodents may be passenger rodent viruses which have no relation to the patient's illness.\n\nToday, this case, if it were properly managed, would have been diagnosed on the day of admission to hospital as western encephalitis by capture IgM ELISA of the serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid, and the brain biopsy would not have been an indicated procedure.\n\nThe mice used were purchased from a vendor supplying specific pathogen-free mice. I emphasize that while purchasing from such a vendor is highly recommended, it does not guarantee against isolation of a rodent passenger virus.\n\nA primary function of the Arbovirus Reference Center is identification of unknown viruses. We receive between 80 and 200 such agents per year as unknowns. Some of these are viruses of laboratory rodents.\n\nI would like to tell you that we always recognize these for what they are, but unfortunately this is not always so.\n\nIn March 1966 we studied a virus designated Romania 176 which had been received from the Virus Laboratory of the Institute of Medicine, Romania (3). The virus was said to have originated from ticks. The virus was inoculated into infant mice; 3 days later a deoxycholate sensitivity test was carried out. Five weeks later another passage was done and adult mice were immunized by intraperitoneal inoculation.\n\nSubsequently this agent was identified as ectromelia.\n\nWe did not observe at that time either increased mortality or tail lesions. Sarcoma 180 was in use routinely to induce ascites in immunized mice, and we did note that animals receiving Sarcoma 180 died early. Dr. Sonja Buckley therefore screened ascitic fluids for ectromelia and found infected fluid as early as August 1966\u00b7 Forty-three of 153 ascitic fluids were positive through September 1967\u00b7 The Arbovirus Unit was also actively depositing virus strains in the American Type Culture Collection\u00b7 Fifteen of these were contaiminated; fortunately none of these had been further distributed.\n\nAll distribution of reagents from the Unit was also discontinued\u00b7 Briody vaccine was used from April 1967 through September 1967.\n\nAscitic fluids continued positive for poxvirus and all experimental work was stopped from September 1967 to January 1968.\n\nHow then was ectromelia controlled? The facility was depopulated, fumigated with beta-propiolactone and then re-stocked with cesarian-derived mice. The immediate direct cost was in excess of $10,000. Ectromelia was eradicated; coincidentally polyoraa infection, enzootic in the colony, was also eradicated.\n\nFor the next 7 years an ectromelia immune barrier was maintained. This involved mixing ectromelia immune rabbit serum with each new specimen received and passaged by the Reference Center. No ectromelia was recognized during the 7 year period. In 1975 the barrier was discontinued and we again began to recognize ectromelia among unknown viruses submitted for identification. We have since received 6 strains from 4 continents including Australia and Europe.\n\nIt appears likely that the immune barrier in place prior to 1975 was effective. This hypothesis was strengthened by the finding that 63% of sera of colony mice, collected in 1973 and stored frozen, neutralized mouse hepatitis virus. A new stock of the Egyptian isolate was used to immunize mice from a colony free of mouse hepatitis virus. The new antibody was specific and showed the Egyptian isolate to be closely related to the JHM serotype of mouse hepatitis virus.\n\nThe 1973 colony infection with mouse hepatitis virus had made it impossible to prepare a specific antibody and had obscured the attempts to type new isolates.\n\nFinally, I would like to share with you the collective experience of our laboratory and 9 others in the NIHsponsored program to produce arbovirus reference reagents between 1964 and 1978. Contractors produced reagent sets which included a seed virus reagent and a mouse hyperimmune ascitic fluid.\n\nData are available on 70 such reagent sets (5).\n\nEach seed virus reagent was subjected to a murine antibody production (MAP) test to detect contaminating murine viruses, and each ascitic fluid was tested for infectivity and for murine virus antibodies.\n\nOf 70 ascitic fluids only 30 were free of murine viruses or their antibodies.\n\nOf these 30, 16 were produced by a single contractor.\n\nThe 40 ascitic fluids with murine virus antibody included 26 with minute virus of mice, 11 with Sendai, 5 with reovirus-3, 4 with mouse hepatitis, and 1 or 2 each with pneumonia virus of mice, polyoma, lactose dehydrogenase, or lymphocytic choriomeningitis antibodies. Twentyfour of 40 were positive to poxvirus but I question the specificity of this test. The safety test of one reagent, the Oropouche ascitic fluid, revealed mouse encephalomyelitis virus as a contaminant.\n\nBocas virus presented the NIH program with a rather unusual problem.\n\nBocas (BT 25) was registered in the Catalogue of Arthropod-Borne Viruses (10) by Dr. Enid de Rodaniche as an agent from mosquitoes of Panama. Bocas antigen reacted by CF test with the NIH-distributed California encephalitis mouse ascitic fluid, was considered a member of the California serogroup of arboviruses, and was scheduled for production of a reference reagent set at the California State Department of Health Laboratories. Dr. Richard Emmons of that laboratory produced the seed virus reagent and reported that the MAP test was positive for mouse hepatitis virus.\n\nWith this information, the Arbovirus Unit at Yale tested Bocas antigen with a coronavirus reference antigen and serum. The results are shown in It was presumably a laboratory pick-up either in Panama or during subsequent passage, and the reaction with the California encephalitis virus was explained by contaminating mouse hepatitis virus antibody in the mice immunized with California encephalitis virus.\n\nThe findings described in the above case studies emphasize the potential of indigenous rodent viruses to disrupt infectious disease research. The mouse is becoming even more important in research with the development of the new mouse-based technology involving hybridomas and monoclonal antibodies.\n\nThe predictable increased use of mice with the hybridoma methodology can only serve to accentuate the problems caused by murine viruses. The examples which I have described were drawn mostly from the experience of a single arbovirus reference laboratory and represent only a small fraction of the collective experience of infectious disease researchers.\n\nI trust you will agree with me however, that the diagnosis, surveillance, and control of these rodent viruses is a worthy aim and ultimately, when we succeed, will save us all time, effort, and money."}
