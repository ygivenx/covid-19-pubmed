{"title": "Emergence of human caliciviruses among diarrhea cases in southwest China", "body": "Acute gastroenteritis is still one of the most concerning public health problems that causes considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide [1, 2]. Human caliciviruses (HuCV) including norovirus (NoV) and sapovirus (SaV) are single-stranded RNA viruses [3]. NoV is classified into six genogroups (GI\u2013GVI), which are subdivided into at least 38 genotypes based on their cap and pol genes [4]. NoV is the leading cause of sporadic cases and outbreaks of acute diarrhea worldwide [5, 6]. NoV-related viral gastroenteritis, known as the stomach flu, is one kind of mild diarrhea, and is characterized by sudden intense vomiting (more common in children), watery stool, or liquid stool without blood (more common in adults) [7]. The NoV infection is self-limiting and the symptoms may disappear after less than three days, but prolonged diarrhea symptoms (e.g. dehydration and death) and viral shedding might occur in immune-deficient individuals and the elderly [5, 8].\n\nNoV is one of the important enteropathogens associated with acute diarrhea, but it has been underestimated in terms of its burden for many years, for a lack of adequate diagnostic tools until 1993 [8]. Although NoV had not been cultivated with cells until now, modern biotechnology, including gene sequencing, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and real time RT-PCR have been applied to detect NoV in fecal specimens. These can help us to accurately understand and estimate the impact of NoV [8, 9].\n\nThe prevalence of NoV is about 18.0 % in acute sporadic diarrhea cases worldwide [10]. The detection rates of NoV were fluctuant in different medical facilities, and the prevalence of NoV in community cases (24.0 %) is higher than that of outpatient cases (20.0 %) and inpatient cases (17.0 %), respectively [10]. Simultaneously, NoV had a high prevalence in the Eastern Mediterranean, and Middle and South American regions [11]. NoV-associated diarrhea prevalence is up to 40\u2013640 cases per 10,000 persons in outpatient treatment and 14 per 10,000 persons in emergency department visits in some developed regions [12]. NoV lead more than 21 million sporadic diarrhea cases, over 70 thousands sporadic hospitalization cases, and nearly 150 deaths of all ages, in the United States annually [13, 14]. In addition, economic loss caused by NoV was also serious; more than $284 million in medical charges are induced by NoV infection in emergency departments annually [12].\n\nNoV is also known as one of the major leading causes of acute nonbacterial outbreaks of diarrhea. NoV-associated diarrhea outbreaks occurred more than 900 times during the period of 1993\u20132011 [15], and involved many diarrhea cases in a short timeframe, causing social panic and anxiety. Outbreaks of diarrhea episodes caused by NoV often occurred in a variety of settings, such as ships, the army, schools, hospitals, and elderly homes [16\u201319]. Children, soldiers, and the elderly were susceptible to NoV outbreaks [8, 20]. In developing countries, malnourished children or infants raised without good hygienic conditions had a high risk of suffering morbidity and mortality caused by NoV [21].\n\nNoV has caused increasing concern in recent years, which has been attributed to a large number of reported outbreaks of diarrhea and to food safety issues [13, 15]. Acute gastroenteritis is still one of the major public health problems in China [22], with NoV playing an important role in diarrhea, especially in adults [23]. But, overwhelmingly, diarrhea studies have mostly been focusing on rotavirus in young children. Notably, the epidemic characteristics of NoV in diarrhea cases across all age groups is sparsely characterized, especially in low-income regions such as southwest China. The information on distribution of HuCV subtypes and NoV genotypes is limited.\n\nThis study aims to: (i) understand the detection rate of HuCV, (ii) grasp the NoV GII genotype distribution, and (iii) understand the relationship between NoV genotypes and clinical symptoms.\n\nAn \u201cacute diarrhea case\u201d was defined as any case in which the patient excreted stool more than three times within a 24-hour period and in which the stool form was not normal (e.g. loose, watery, bloody, and/or mucousy stool). A \u201chealthy control\u201d was defined as any case in which the subject was without diarrhea symptom and other gastrointestinal diseases.\n\nFour sentinel hospitals were selected for this study, namely the First People\u2019s Hospital of Yunnan Province, the First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, the Kunming Children\u2019s Hospital, and Pushan Community Hospital.\n\nStool specimens were collected from subjects with acute diarrhea and without diarrhea by trained doctors or nurses. Sterilized sampling cups were used to collect stools, the amount of fecal samples was more than 3 g or 3 mL, each stool sample was temporarily preserved at \u221220 \u00b0C and was transferred to the laboratory of the local Center for Disease Control, and then a part of each stool specimen was taken out and balanced to 10 % suspension with a phosphate buffer solution. RT-PCR was applied to examine SaV, and NoV GI and GI. A structured questionnaire was used to record the demographic information and clinical symptoms of each subject. This study was conducted from July 2014 to June 2015.\n\nA viral nucleic acid extraction kit (Geneaid Biotech Ltd, Taiwan, China) was applied to extract the viral nucleic acid from each stool specimen following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. A 15 % fecal suspension was centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 g, 150 \u03bcL supernatant was used to extract the three viral nucleic acids, and 50 \u03bcL extracted RNA was obtained and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C prior to virus detection.\n\nA two-step multiplex RT-PCR was performed to detect SaV, and NoV GI and GII. The primes of p289/p290 target the polymerase region as previously described, this pair of primes produces PCR products of 331 bp for SaV and 319 bp for NoV (GI, GII) [24, 25]. The reverse transcription reaction was performed using the SuperScript II kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The reaction condition of cDNA synthesis was 42 \u00b0C for 90 min, and 99 \u00b0C for 5 min. Each 40 \u03bcL reaction volume consisted of 20 \u03bcL SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex Taq\u2122 (Takara Bio Inc, Shlga, Japan), 2 \u03bcL cDNA template, 12 \u03bcL DNase and RNase free water, and 1 \u03bcL of 10 \u03bcM forward primer and reverse primer, respectively. The thermal profile consisted of 94 \u00b0C for 5 min, 40 cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 70s, 49 \u00b0C for 70s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. The PCR amplicons were analyzed in a 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis at 120 V for 40 min and observed under UV light after ethidium bromide staining. Positive PCR products were kept at \u221270 \u00b0C, and were then sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed.\n\nData analysis was performed using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS v19.0) software (IBM, USA). The odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of categorical variables were calculated using the chi-square test or the Fisher\u2019s exact test with two-tailed. A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\n\nA molecular evolutionary genetics analysis was employed to perform the phylogenetic analysis (MEGA v5.2). A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Reference strains were downloaded from GenBank.\n\nIn the present study, which was conducted from July 2014 to June 2015, 1,440 subjects including children and adults participated. Among those, 1,121 were acute diarrhea patients and 319 were healthy controls. The male to female sex ratios in diarrhea cases and healthy controls were 1.00 and 1.01, respectively (\u03c72 = 0.341, p = 0.558). The average ages of patients and healthy controls were 0.6 years and 2.3 years, respectively. The majority of the subjects were from urban areas; 753 cases (67.2 %) and 223 (57.0 %) controls. The average frequency of diarrhea in patients was six episodes (quartile range = 2). Various types of clinical symptoms were observed in the diarrhea cases. Vomiting (n = 263, 23.5 %) was the most common clinical symptom, followed by fever (n = 136, 12.1 %) and dehydration (n = 64, 5.7 %).\n\nThe detection rate of HuCV was 11.0 % (n = 123) in diarrhea cases across all age groups. Among these, the prevalence of NoV GII was 10.5 % (n = 118) in acute gastroenteritis patients of all ages, followed by SaV (0.3 %, n = 3) and NoV GI (0.2 %, n = 2). The prevalence of both NoV genogroups (GI and GII) was 10.7 % (n = 120) in diarrhea cases across all ages.\n\nHuCV was detected in 123 (11.0 %) diarrhea cases and 11 (3.4 %) healthy controls (p < 0.0001, OR = 3.5, 95 % CI 1.8\u20136.5). No significant differences were observed in NoV GI between diarrhea patients (n = 2, 0.2 %) and healthy controls (n = 1, 0.3 %, p = 0.528). SaV was detected in three (0.3 %) diarrhea cases, but was not found in controls (p = 0.472). NoV GII was more prevalent in patients relative to healthy controls across all age groups (10.5 %, 3.1 %, respectively, OR = 3.6, 95 % CI 1.8\u20137.0). NoV genotype GII.4 was found in 55 (4.9 %) diarrhea cases and six (1.9 %) non-diarrhea cases (p = 0.018, OR = 2.7, 95 % CI 1.1\u20136.3). GII.12 was detected in 25 diarrhea cases and three healthy controls (2.2 %, 0.9 %, respectively, p = 0.141, OR = 2.4, 95 % CI 0.7\u20138.0). The detection rate of GII.5 in diarrhea cases was as high as in healthy controls (0.2 %, 0.3 %, respectively, p = 0.403, OR = 0.57, 95 % CI 0.05\u20136.3). No significant differences in GII.12 and GII.5 were observed between diarrhea patients and healthy patients (see Table 1). GII.17 was only found in diarrhea cases (n = 8, 0.7 %).\n\nIn patients aged below five years, HuCV and NoV GII were detected more often in those with diarrhea than in those without (11.5 % vs. 4.7 %, respectively, p < 0.05, OR = 2.6, 95 % CI 1.3\u20135.5; 11.1 % vs. 5.5 %, respectively, p < 0.05, OR = 2.5, 95 % CI 1.2\u20135.3). HuCV was more prevalent in patients than in controls aged above five years (8.6 % vs. 1.5 %, respectively, p = 0.005, OR = 6.4, 95 % CI 1.5\u201327.5). NoV GII was more prevalent in patients with diarrhea relative to healthy controls aged above five years (8.2 % vs. 1.5 %, respectively, p = 0.01007, OR = 6.0, 95 % CI 1.4\u201326.2). NoV GII was detected in 14.8 % of elderly cases, but neither NoV GI nor SaV was detected in controls over 65 years. No significant differences in these three virus pathogens were observed between cases and controls over 65 years of age (see Table 1).\n\nOne hundred and twenty-three strains of HuCV were isolated from diarrhea cases of all ages. NoV GII (n = 118, 10.5 %) was the leading subtype of HuCV, followed by SaV (n = 3, 0.3 %) and NoV GI (n = 2, 0.2 %). Of the 118 strains of NoV GII isolated from 1,121 diarrhea cases, the predominant genotype was GII.4 (n = 55, 46.6 %), followed by GII.3 (n = 28, 23.7 %) and GII.12 (n = 25, 21.2 %). The prevalences of GII.17 and GII.5 were less than 1.0 % in diarrhea cases. Among the 10 strains of NoV GII detected in healthy controls, the top two most prevalent genotypes were GII.12 (n = 3, 0.9 %) and GII.5 (n = 3, 0.3 %). Others genotypes were not detected in asymptomatic individuals (see Table 1).\n\nIn the present study, diarrhea cases were divided into five subunits, where 791 (70.6 %), 59 (5.3 %), 21 (1.9 %), 223 (19.9 %), and 27 (2.4 %) diarrhea patients fell into the age ranges of 0\u20132 years, 2\u20135 years, 5\u201314 years, 14\u201365 years, and over 65 years, respectively. Although NoV GII was more prevalent in children below two years of age and adults above 65 years of age, no significant difference in presence of NoV GII was found between the age groups (\u03c72 = 8.31, p = 0.061). GII.12 had an obvious age distribution trend (\u03c72 = 15.4, p = 0.004), which was only found in patients aged 0\u20132 years (3.0 %) and 2\u20135 years (1.7 %). The prevalence of GII.4 had not age distribution trend (\u03c72 = 3.83, p = 0.426). No significant differences in GII.17, GII.3, and GII.5 were observed in diarrhea cases across all age groups (see Table 2).\n\nNo notable seasonal trend was observed in NoV GI and SaV, but NoV GII (n = 39, 14.6 %) had a peak in prevalence in the fall (\u03c72 = 12.2, p = 0.007). The prevalences of GII.5 and GII.12 did not show distinct seasonal variation, and the prevalences of GII.3 and GII.17 showed minor seasonal variations across one year, respectively. GII.4 was detected throughout the year and significant differences were observed in different seasons (\u03c72 = 13.3, p = 0.004), with a seasonal peak of GII.4 (n = 23, 8.4 %) in the fall (see Table 3).\n\nThe various clinical symptoms associated with HuCV subtypes and NoV genotypes are summarized in Table 4. In acute diarrhea cases; vomiting was observed more frequently in diarrhea cases infected with GII.4 (40.0 %, p < 0.05), GII.3 (57.1 %, p < 0.05), and GII.12 (48.0 %, p < 0.05); and dehydration was only associated with GII.4 (14.5 %, p < 0.05) and GII.3 (25 %, p < 0.05). Watery stool was more commonly observed in diarrhea patients infected with GII.4, GII.3, and GII.12 (63.6 %, 75.0 %, 72.0 %, respectively, p < 0.05); and mucousy stool was found less frequently in GII.3 and GII.12 (25.0 %, 24.0 %, respectively, p < 0.05) than in GII.4 (see Table 4).\n\nIn the study, 123 strains of HuCV were isolated from acute gastroenteritis cases, of which two (1.6 %) cases were NoV GI, three (2.4 %) cases were classified as SaV, and 118 (95.9 %) cases were classified as NoV GII. Among the 118 strains of NoV GII, five genotypes were identified as followed: GII.4 (n = 55, 46.6 %), GII.3 (n = 28, 23.7 %), GII.12 (n = 25, 21.2 %), GII.17 (n = 8, 6.8 %), and GII.5 (n = 2, 1.7 %). Of all the 55 strains of GII.4, the GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant was absolutely predominant (n = 52, 94.5 %), followed by the GII.4-2006b variant (n = 3, 5.5 %). The GII.4 Orleans 2009 variant was not found in diarrhea cases in this study.\n\nEleven strains of HuCV were found in healthy controls. One (9.1 %) case was classified as NoV GI, which was a GI.3 genotype, and 10 (90.9 %) cases were classified as NoV GII, which were divided into GII.4 (n = 6, 60.0 %), GII.12 (n = 3, 30.0 %), and GII.5 (n = 1, 10.0 %). Of the six strains of GII.4, four (80.0 %) strains were of the GII.4 Sydney 2012 variant and two (20.0 %) were of the GII.4-2006b variant. The GII.4 Orleans 2009 variant was not found in healthy controls (see Fig. 1).\n\nThere were several limitations on our research. Firstly, the subjects were mainly selected from urban areas, and in addition, the diarrhea cases were all selected from outpatient department, which might lead to selection bias in respect of the epidemiological characteristics of HuCV. Secondly, the number of healthy controls was small, hence the OR of the HuCV and NoV genogroups were not highly reliable. Thirdly, genetic characterization of NoV was only based on partial polymerase regions in this study. However, the genotyping of NoV based on only capsid regions or on both regions might provide different results. Therefore, further study involving diarrhea cases selected from urban, rural, outpatient, and inpatients departments will should be conducted to ensure accurate assessment of the NoV disease burden. A 1:1 match case-control study will be a good choice. Meanwhile, genotyping of NoV based on both capsid regions and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase regions should be conducted in order to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of NoV GII genotyping.\n\nIn summary, the results show that NoV is one of the major causes of diarrhea, that GII.4 is still the predominant strain, and that GII.17 has emerged in sporadic diarrhea cases and might become a predominant strain, which will lead to more cases and outbreaks of diarrhea in the near future. This will provide new obstacles to preventing NoV-associated diarrhea. Therefore, monitoring the prevalence trends and evolution of GII.17 is necessary."}
