{"title": "Houttuynia cordata Thunb. polysaccharides ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury in mice", "body": "Acute lung injury (ALI) and its most severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by acute lung inflammation and edema, account for high rates of morbidity and mortality in humans (Fulkerson et al., 1996; McMullen et al., 2012) . Some reports showed that complement activation, which can cause inflammatory cells recruitment to the alveolar-capillary membrane, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALI Robbins et al., 1987) . As one of the complement activation products, C5a is a strong chemoattractant that increases the infiltration of activated neutrophils and macrophages into the pulmonary vasculature, lung interstitium, and alveolar space, resulting in immune response and disruption of the alveolar epithelial barrier (Flierl et al., 2008; Guo and Ward, 2005) . Intensive investigations are still needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of ALI, which remains obscure and is generally believed to be associated with over-activation of complement system, the recruitment of leukocyte, and inflammation mediated by inflammatory mediators including nitric oxide (NO), TNF-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6 (Naito et al., 2013; Tsai et al., 2014; Xie et al., 2012) .\n\nHouttuynia cordata Thunb. (HC, Saururaceae family) is a perennial herb and time-honored traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It has a thin stalk and heart-shaped leaf, and reaches an average length of 15-50 cm. It is affluently distributed in the central, southeast and southwest regions of China and is harvested in summer or autumn (Yang and Jiang, 2009; Meng et al., 2009 ). HC possesses a large range of pharmacological activities, such as antiviral, anti-oxidative effects (Hayashi et al., 1995) . During severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in late 2002 to mid-2003, a TCM formula was proposed to general public as a preventive measure by the State Administration of TCM of China. HC was one of the six ingredients in this formula, owing to its abilities to diminish inflammation (Lau et al., 2008; Zhang and Chen, 2008) . Some reports showed that polysaccharides from plants possessed the activities of modulating host responses and improving immunity (Graff et al., 2009; Holderness et al., 2011; Lee and Hong, 2011) . It is reasonable to presume that polysaccharides extracted from HC may exhibit the inhibitory effects against ALI.\n\nTo assure our hypothesis and further make clear the possible mechanisms, LPS was used, a major cell wall component of bacteria and powerful initiators of inflammatory reaction to induce the model in mice. The model established through intratracheal instillation of LPS to mice provides a good experimental model of ALI/ARDS to mimic the inflammatory response in patients (Naito et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2012) . Although various factors such as complement activities and inflammatory cells are involved in these responses, LPS recognition by the immune sentinel cells is a vital step to initiate inflammatory process in this model (Akira and Takeda, 2004) . Toll-like receptors (TLRs) has been considered to play critical roles in immune system by recognizing microbial pathogens and initiating innate and adaptive immune responses. Of all the TLRs, TLR4 specifically senses LPS and transmits signals to host cells like macrophages, and then triggers signal transduction to up-regulate inflammatory cytokines and therefore causes inflammation (Akira and Takeda, 2004; Deng et al., 2013) .\n\nIn this study, the therapeutic effects and the mechanisms of HCP on the experimental model of ALI were investigated.\n\nLPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5) and Polymyxin B (PB) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate Injection (DEX, No. 1303040, used as the positive control in LPS-induced ALI model) was purchased from Chongqing Laimei Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Chongqing, China) . Cell culture medium (RPMI-1640) and endotoxin-free fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA). Dexamethasone (DEX, No.D4902, used \n\nMale BALB/c mice (5-8 weeks) were obtained from Slaccas-Shanghai Lab Animal Ltd. (SPF II Certificate; No. SCXK2012-0002) and housed in collective cages under a 12 h light/dark cycle, with free access to food and water.\n\nAll animals received humane care in compliance with the \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\" published by the National Institutes of Health. All the study protocols were approved by the Animal Ethical Committee of School of Pharmacy, Fudan University (approved identification: 2013-50). All the surgeries were performed under urethane anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering.\n\nThe dried whole plants of HC were purchased from Huayu Materia Medica Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Verification of identity was carried out by Dr. Yan Lu (Fudan University, Shanghai, China), and the voucher specimen (DFC-YXC-2006072601 ) was deposited at the Herbarium of Materia Medica, Department of Pharmacognosy, School of Pharmacy, Fudan University, Shanghai, PR China.\n\nThe isolation and chromatographic studies of polysaccharides were accomplished similar as previously described by Cheng et al. (2010) . The dried whole plants (1 kg) of HC were grounded in a high-speed rotary cutting mill into fine particles and defatted with 15 L 95% ethanol for 24 h. The residue was dried in air and it weighed about 913 g, and was extracted in 27.39 L (almost 30 times residue weight) hot water in 90\u00b0C. The extraction process was repeated 3 times and almost 75 L extracting solution was collected. The hot water extract was concentrated to 7.6 L and then 40.5 L 95% ethanol was added. After 24 h, it was centrifuged and the deposition was redissolved in 1.5 L water. The proteins existed in water solution were precipitated by adding 7% trichloroacetic acid at 4\u00b0C. Then the supernatant was neutralized and was dialyzed in the running water for 3 days. The polysaccharides (15.3 g) were made as the supernatant was concentrated and then lyophilized for the following experiments.\n\nHCP was a dark-brown powder and was soluble in water. The total carbohydrate and uronic acid contents were determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid and m-hydroxybiphenyl methods respectively, using D-galactose and D-galacturonic acid as respective standards. HCP comprises 77.21% of total carbohydrate and 36.69% of uronic acid. Furthermore, the total protein content was measured using Coomassie brilliant blue staining and the protein content in HCP was 6.17%. The monosaccharide composition of HCP was determined by gas chromatographic analysis, and HCP is mainly composed of Glc, Gal, Ara and Rha in the ratio of 3.40:2.14:1.17:1.00, along with trace of Man and Xyl. High-performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC) analysis showed that HCP contains one major polysaccharide with several minor ones (Fig. 1) .\n\nThe content of LPS in HCP was 5.5 ng/100 \u03bcg (55 ppm), assayed by the limulus amebocyte lysate reagent method, which has been widely used (Chang and Sack, 2001; Ryder et al., 1976) . To examine the anti-inflammatory effects of HCP (1, 10, and 100 \u03bcg/ml) in some of the following experiments, PB, a well-characterized LPS inhibitor (Jacobs and Morrison, 1977) , was selected to pretreat with HCP at 37\u00b0C for 24 h to eliminate the possibility that the contamination of endotoxin in HCP may affect the experiment results (Wu et al., 2013) .\n\nThe mice were randomly assigned to six groups (n \u00bc8): Shamoperated animals group (sham group, n \u00bc9), LPS alone group (model group), LPS \u00feHCP treated group (HCP 40 mg/kg group, HCP 80 mg/kg group, HCP 160 mg/kg group) and LPS \u00feDEX (4 mg/kg) treated group (DEX group).The doses of these drugs and LPS were based on our previous studies and preliminary experiments.\n\nHCP was dissolved in normal saline (NS) and administered orally by gavage (p.o.). The model of ALI was employed as previously described method by Li et al. (2012) . Mice were anesthetized with 20% urethane before intratracheal instillation (i.t.) of NS (sham group, i.t.) or LPS (E. coli 055:B5, 3 mg/kg i.t.). HCP was administered intragastrically (i.g.) 2 h after LPS instillation. DEX at 4 mg/kg was given via tail vein (i.v.) 2 h after LPS exposure as a positive control.\n\nTwenty-four hour after LPS exposure, mice were euthanized. The right lungs were ligated, and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained on the left lung using 0.5 ml normal saline four times. After centrifugation (4\u00b0C, 1000g, 10 min), the cell-free supernatants were harvested and stored at \u00c080\u00b0C for subsequent analysis, and the cell pellets were re-suspended in 200 mL NS for cell counts using a hemocytometer as previously described by Xie et al. (2012) . The levels of TNF-\u03b1 and protein in BALF were measured by mouse TNF-\u03b1 ELISA kit and BCA protein assay kit respectively according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nTo evaluate the severity of tissue edema, the lung w/d was calculated. After euthanasia of mice, the inferior lobe of right lungs were excised and measured immediately to obtain the \"wet weight\", and then dried in an oven to constant weight at 50\u00b0C for 72 h and weighed again to obtain the \"dry weight\".\n\nThe superior lobe of right lung was removed and fixed immediately in 4% formaldehyde in 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and used for histological evaluation. The tissue fixed in formalin was dehydrated and embedded in paraffin and sections (5 \u03bcm) were mounted on glass slide and stained with H&E to evaluate the severity of pneumonia.\n\nImmunohistochemical staining was performed as previously described by Chiou et al. (2004) and Jiang et al. (2012) . Hightemperature antigen retrieval was performed by immersion of the deparaffinized slides in 10 mM trisodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a water bath at 99\u00b0C for 20 min. After quenching of endogenous peroxidase with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol (v/v) for 15 min, the non-specific binding sites of the sections were blocked with 5% BSA. The sections were then incubated with rabbit anti-C3d antibody (1:300) or murine monoclonal anti-TLR4 antibody (1:100, Abcam) at 4\u00b0C overnight in a humidified chamber, and followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C with HRP-conjugated goat antirabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody for 30 min.\n\nImmunohistochemical staining of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and macrophages were performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Deparaffinized sections were treated with 20 \u03bcg/ml of proteinase K for 15 min at 37\u00b0C before antigen retrieval. After quenching of endogenous peroxidase and then blocking for 30 min with normal rabbit serum (Vector), the sections were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight in a humidified chamber with rat monoclonal Ly-6G/Ly-6C (Gr-1) (1:100, clone: RB6-8C5; BioLegend) to PMNs or rat monoclonal F4/80 antibody (1:100, clone Cl:A3-1; AbD Serotec ) to lung macrophages. The next day, the sections were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with a rabbit anti rat secondary antibody labeled with biotin and then with HRPconjugated ABC Reagent. (VECTASTAIN s Elite ABC-Peroxidase Kit, Cat. No. PK-6104, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).\n\nSlices were visualized using chromogenic substrate solution DAB and counterstained with hematoxylin, and then observed under a microscope.\n\nMale BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with 1 ml of 5% sodium thioglycollate medium. Mice were sacrificed 4 days after injection and the peritoneal cavities were flushed with 5 ml of chilled RPMI 1640 medium and the peritoneal lavage fluids were centrifuged at 80g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to isolate peritoneal macrophages (Cheng et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2013) .\n\nAll the procedures described here were carried out in aseptic conditions, and the materials were previously sterilized and pyrogen-free.\n\nThe in vitro anti-complement activity of the HCP was examined according to a previously described method by Xie et al. (2012) . To prepare sensitized erythrocytes (EAs), the 2% sheep erythrocytes were pre-incubated with rabbit anti-sheep erythrocyte antibody (1:1000) in equal volumes. The samples were diluted in isotonic veronal-buffered saline (VBS 2 \u00fe ) (containing 0.5 mM Mg 2 \u00fe and 0.15 mM Ca 2 \u00fe ). Guinea pig serum was used as the source of complement described by Xie et al. (2012) . According to our preliminary experiment, the 1:60 diluted Guinea pig serum was able to give submaximal lysis in the absence of complement inhibitors, and was chosen as the complement source. As a positive control, Suramin (300 \u03bcg/ml) was able to inhibit 100% of the lysis.\n\nThe tested samples (200 \u03bcL) were mixed with 200 \u03bcL of Guinea pig serum, and then, 200 \u03bcL of EAs was added. The mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. The different assay controls were incubated in the same conditions: (1) vehicle control: 200 \u03bcL EAs in 400 \u03bcL VBS 2 \u00fe ; (2) 100% lysis: 200 \u03bcL EAs in 400 \u03bcL ultrapure water;\n\n(3) 0% lysis: 100 \u03bcL 2% non-sensitized sheep erythrocytes and 200 \u03bcL Guinea pig serum in 300 \u03bcL VBS 2 \u00fe ; and (4) samples background: 200 \u03bcL of each dilution of HCP sample in 400 \u03bcL VBS 2 \u00fe . The mixtures were centrifuged (1000g, 10 min) immediately at 4\u00b0C after incubation, and the optical density of the supernatant was measured at 405 nm on a well scanner (Labsystems Dragon). Results were Fig. 1 . High-performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC) of HCP. HCP was analyzed on a TSK GMPWXL gel filtration column (7.6 mm \u00c2 300 mm, TOSOH), eluted with ultrapure water at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and detected at 254 nm. indicated in percentage of hemolytic inhibition. Inhibition of lysis (%)\u00bc100-100 \u00c2 (OD sample \u00c0 OD sample background \u00c0 OD 0% lysis )/(OD 100% lysis \u00c0 OD 0% lysis ).\n\nAfter centrifugation, the macrophages were resuspended with RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% BSA. Cell migration was assessed using a 24-well 8-mm pore chemotaxis chamber (Chiou et al., 2004 ) (Transwell, Corning Costar). The cells (1 \u00c2 10 5 cells/ chamber) were plated in the upper chamber of Transwell inserts (Corning) while C5a (50 ng/ml) was added in the lower compartment as a stimulus without or with HCP (1, 10, and 100 \u03bcg/ml).\n\nAfter incubation for 4 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2, the inserts were removed, and the inner surface was rinsed and wiped with a little lump of cotton to remove nonmigrated cells. The cells on the outside of the inserts were formalin-fixed and then stained using crystal violet. The inserts were observed under a microscope. Cells in each insert were counted in 10 randomly selected fields at \u00c2 400 magnification to evaluate chemotaxis. Chemotaxis index (CI)\u00bccells of sample/cells of control \u00c2 100%. The inhibition ratio of cell migration\u00bc(cells of model group\u00c0 cells of sample group)/cells of model group. The experiments were performed in triplicate. Spontaneous migration in 0.1% BSA-RPMI 1640 served as control and was designed as a basic migration for each experiment, and complement 5 a-induced cell migration in 0.1% BSA -RPMI 1640 acted as model group.\n\nThe cells were resuspended with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS and cultured in 96-well plates (1 \u00c2 10 6 cells/well). After incubation for 2 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 , the cells were washed two times to remove the non-adherent cells.\n\nCells (1 \u00c2 10 6 cells/ml) were incubated with or without LPS\n\n(1 \u03bcg/ml), while HCP was added in at the same time, for 24 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 , and then, the supernatant of the culture media was collected to evaluate the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10 using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits according to the manufacturer's instruction. The content of nitric oxide in the culture media was measured according to the colorimetric method described previously by Bakker et al. (2009) , Joh and Kim (2010), using Griess reagent. The culture medium (60 \u03bcl) was combined with an equal volume of Griess reagent [mixture of equal volume of 1% sulfanilamide in 5% H 3 PO 4 and 0.1% N-(1-naphthyl) ethylenediamine dihydrochloride in H 2 O] in a 96-well flate-bottom microtiter plate and incubated for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. Then the optical densities were measured at 540 nm using a spectrophotometer and the concentration of nitrite was determined by a standard curve.\n\nData were expressed as means 7standard deviation (S.D.). One-way ANOVA was performed for multiple group comparisons. If data were found to have significant changes, post-hoc comparisons were performed using Fisher's PLSD. P o0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\n\n3.1.1. Effect of HCP on histopathological changes in lungs of ALI mice\n\nLung tissues from ALI model group exhibited widespread pulmonary alveolar wall thickness accompanied by edema, obvious infiltration of inflammatory cells, and severe hemorrhage in the alveolus. While in sham group, the lungs showed a normal structure and these lesions were not apparent. Treatment with HCP or DEX obviously ameliorated these injuries ( Fig. 2A) .\n\nTwenty-four hour after LPS administration, total cells and TNF\u03b1 production in BALF were assessed. Dramatic increases were observed in total cells and TNF-\u03b1 production after LPS instillation compared to those of sham group (P o0.001, as shown in Fig. 2B and C). Compared with vehicle treated ALI group, HCP (40, 80 and 160 mg/kg) and DEX (4 mg/kg) treated ALI group exhibited decreased total cells (Po 0.05) and TNF-\u03b1 concentration (Po 0.01) in BALF of mice.\n\nThe concentration of protein in BALF supernatant was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2D , compared with sham group, the levels of protein were significantly elevated (P o0.001) in model group. Treatments with HCP (40, 80, and 160 mg/kg) or DEX (4 mg/kg) markedly reduced the concentration of protein as compared with model group (P o0.05).\n\nThe w/d were significantly elevated in vehicle treated model group compared with sham group (Fig. 2E ). By comparison, such elevations were blunted by HCP (80 and 160 mg/kg) and DEX treatment (P o0.05)\n\nTo determine whether HCP might affect ALI by reducing complement deposition in the lungs of mice, the lung tissue sections were stained to examine the presence of C3d. In agreement with our previous studies , immunohistochemistry showed very low levels of staining for complement deposition in the lungs of sham group (Fig. 3A) . The model group exhibited intense immunostaining of C3d in lung tissue. Treatments with HCP (40, 80, and 160 mg/kg) and DEX (4 mg/kg) after instillation of LPS significantly inhibited C3d deposition in lung tissue.\n\nThe effect of HCP on TLR4 expression in lungs of mice was evaluated. The results showed intense immunostaining for TLR4 expression in lung tissue of model group (Fig. 3B ). Compared with model group, HCP (40, 80 and 160 mg/kg) and DEX treated ALI group exhibited relatively low levels of staining in lung tissue.\n\nThe effect of HCP on attenuating the infiltration of PMNs and macrophages in lung tissue of mice was evaluated. The results showed intense immunostaining for PMNs (Fig. 3C ) and macrophages (Fig. 3D) infiltration in lungs of model group. Compared with model group, HCP (40, 80 and 160 mg/kg) and DEX treated ALI group exhibited relatively low levels of staining in lung tissue.\n\nThe anti-complementary activities of HCP were evaluated and the polysaccharides significantly inhibited the hemolysis of sensitized sheep erythrocytes when incubated with Guinea pig serum (IC 50 \u00bc0.348 70.012 mg/ml) (As shown in Fig. 4) .\n\nThe chemotactic effect on peritoneal macrophages was performed to evaluate whether HCP could inhibit macrophage migration. As shown in Fig. 5A , macrophages without C5a displayed no chemotaxis and low random migration (8.23 71.26 \n\nTo clarify whether HCP could lessen the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, which have been demonstrated to be associated with the lung injury in ALI (Chua et al., 2007) , the peritoneal macrophages were isolated and cultured. The influences of HCP on iNOS/NO, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-10 production were also evaluated. As shown in Fig. 6 , stimulation with LPS\n\n(1 \u03bcg/ml) significantly augmented the levels of NO, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 (Po 0.001; Fig. 6 ). In contrast, HCP (10, 100 \u03bcg/ml) and DEX (10 \u03bcM) markedly suppressed levels of those inflammatory mediators after LPS administration (Po0.001; Fig. 6A -D). The level of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was greatly elevated by LPS (P o0.001; Fig. 6E ). HCP (1, 10, and 100 \u03bcg/ml) further promoted the IL-10 production in LPS-stimulated cells (Po 0.001). The production of NO and cytokines in macrophages treated with HCP (1, 10, and 100 \u03bcg/ml) alone was investigated to determine whether HCP itself can affect the immunologic functions of macrophages. Substantial increases in NO, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-10 were observed (P o0.05) in the HCP (100 \u03bcg/m) treatment group (Fig. 7 A-E) .\n\nTo exclude the possibility that the results above were due to LPS contamination in the drug, HCP was pretreated with PB (30 \u03bcg/ml), a LPS inhibitor, at 37\u00b0C for 24 h before being added to the cell cultures. As seen in Fig. 7 , significantly lower levels of NO, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-10 were observed in the HCP with PB treatment group, compared with the HCP without PB group (Po 0.05).\n\nHC is used as a folk therapy against influenza, asthma, allergy, cancer (Yang and Jiang, 2009) , and also had the anti-inflammatory activity (Lee et al., 2013) . In China, the traditional medicines are mostly prepared in a form of apozem. At present, it is becoming an increasing fascinating approach to use polysaccharides to treat various inflammatory diseases because polysaccharides are major components in the decoction and have remarkable therapeutic effects and relatively low toxicity (Cheng et al., 2010; Jiang et al., 2012; Schepetkin and Quinn, 2006) .\n\nIn the present study, intratracheal instillation of LPS was used to produce the ALI model in mice to mimic the inflammatory response in patients . Instillation of 3 mg/kg LPS into the trachea of mice activated inflammatory cascades within two hours, causing lung injury characterized by accumulation of leukocyte, proteinaceous alveolar exudates, pulmonary edema and hemorrhagic spots.\n\nThe results of this study demonstrated the effectiveness of the isolated natural HCP in ameliorating experimental lung injury in mice. HCP, given orally, consistently ameliorated LPS-induced lung injury, with a direct reduction in lung w/d, total cell counts, inflammatory cells infiltration, protein and TNF-\u03b1 concentration in BALF. Of interest, it was observed that HCP produced a marked decrease in TLR4 expression as seen in lung tissue. In addition, the present research clearly showed that HCP treatment consistently suppressed activation of complement both in vivo and in vitro.\n\nIn healthy individuals, the complement system defends the body against microbial pathogens as an effective innate immune mechanism of host. However, over activation of complement has also been involved in many forms of acute inflammatory, including ALI (Linton and Morgan, 1999) . As a kind of complement protein split product, C5a exerts a broad spectrum of functions. C5a appears to contribute to promoting and perpetuating inflammatory reactions. It is also a potent chemoattractant and is implicated in the recruitment of many inflammatory cells like neutrophils and macrophages (Schmid et al., 1997) . In our experiment, pre-incubation of HCP inhibited the hemolysis of sensitized sheep erythrocytes when complement was present. Besides, complement deposition was found in LPS-mediated ALI and relevantly treatment with HCP prevented the deposition. These effects indicate that HCP inhibit the activation of complement system in model mice, consequently, suppress the release of various protein split products including C5a, which may probably contribute to the heavy infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils in the lung.\n\nLeukocyte infiltration is a hallmark of severe lung injury. According to Silva (2010) , in the early stage of the lung injury, macrophages detect the pathogens and then recruit monocytes, which mature into inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils. However, the redundant recruitment could lead to the aggregation of macrophages and neutrophils in lungs of ALI mice. As discussed earlier, C5a is one of the most inflammatory peptides among the complement activation products, and has chemotactic activity for monocytes and macrophages. In the experiments, the peritoneal macrophages were cultured and the chemotactic effects in the presence of HCP were investigated. Results showed that C5a induced significant migration and treatment with HCP prevented it, which indicates that HCP could directly inhibit the migration, consequently, might decrease the influx of inflammatory cells in lungs of model mice, leading to the palliation of inflammation.\n\nAlveolar macrophages, a large mononuclear phagocytes located in the alveolar compartment of the lungs, play a critical role to defend the lungs against inflammatory conditions by producing and releasing a numerous of inflammatory mediators (Niesler et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2006) , including cytokines, chemokines, and complement factors. A pro-inflammatory micromilieu can be caused by these mediators (Sharma et al., 2007) which may function as chemoattractants for invading cells or stimulate local cells (Seitz et al., 2010) . In addition to suppression of macrophage migration, the beneficial action of HCP in ameliorating ALI in mice is also likely associated with its ability to prevent the overproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators in macrophages. High levels of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-\u03b1 generated in pathophysiological conditions lead to the development of inflammatory responses and cytotoxicity, which may have direct role in mediating tissue damage (Giebelen et al., 2007) . The present study demonstrated that levels of NO, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 from LPS-stimulated macrophages were clearly suppressed in the presence of HCP in vitro, as was consistent with the reduction in BALF TNF-\u03b1 in LPS-induced ALI mice after HCP treatment. Interestingly, in vitro treatment with HCP markedly elevated IL-10 secretion, a relevant anti-inflammatory cytokine, in the macrophage culture supernatant after LPS administration.\n\nThe present study demonstrated that, HCP alone stimulated mild expression of inflammatory cytokines, including NO, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. However, polysaccharides extracted from natural plant sources such as HC can be easily contaminated by LPS during the isolation process, which may interfere with biological evaluation studies (de Santana et al., 2012) . To further investigate whether HCP-induced cytokines expression could be just a consequence of LPS contamination in polysaccharides, the critical experiments were repeated in the presence of PB, a drug that can bind to the lipid A portion of LPS to exclude cell activation by LPS (Coyne and Fenwick, 1993; Stokes et al., 1989) . According to our previous study, 30 \u03bcg/ml PB is sufficient to inhibit up to 10 ng/ml LPS, and has no effect on cell viability. This study showed that treatment with PB suppressed but did not completely abolish HCP- induced secretion of these inflammatory mediators. It is reasonable to suggest that it is HCP but not contaminated LPS in HCP that functions to modulate the secretion of macrophages. Taking the results above into account, HCP decreases the LPS-induced excessive production of NO and cytokines in inflammatory condition but enhances the immunologic functions in physiologic level. This phenomenon demonstrates that HCP may have biphasic actions.\n\nAs a pattern recognition receptor that responds to LPS, TLR4 is up-regulated in many inflammatory diseases induced by LPS (Deng et al., 2013) . This study showed that HCP strikingly reduced the expression of TLR4 in lung tissue. This result demonstrated that HCP might inhibit the interaction between LPS and its receptor-TLR4 to restrict the inflammatory process in the lung.\n\nHCP attenuated LPS-induced lung injury, as evidenced by an inhibition of lung w/d, protein level, TNF-\u03b1 concentration, and inflammatory cells aggregation in BALF. In vivo, HCP decreased the expression of TLR4 and the deposition of complement in the lungs of ALI mice, and in vitro, HCP attenuated C5a-induced chemotaxis and LPS-induced secretion of inflammatory mediators on macrophages. These results suggested that the mechanism of HCP seems to be multifactorial to reduce inflammatory responses in lung. And the most important factor was probably associated with the inhibition of the over activation of complement and macrophages. Fig. 6 .
