{"title": "Mimicry of Human IgE Epitopes by Anti-idiotypic Antibodies", "body": "The immune network theory proposes the idea that anti-idiotypic antibodies are produced during the immune response to a given antigen (Jerne, 1974) . A subset of these anti-idiotypic antibodies, termed internal image antibodies, or Ab2b, are able to mimic the molecular structure of the nominal antigen (Jerne et al., 1982; Pan et al., 1995) . Such anti-idiotypic antibodies have been successfully isolated and characterised from animals immunised with external antigens (Goldbaum et al., 1998; Bona, 1996; Pan et al., 1995) . In humans, natu-rally occurring auto-anti-idiotypic antibodies have been detected serologically in patients with autoimmune diseases, but also in normal donors (Jayne et al., 1993; Bronshtein et al., 1992; Zouali & Eyquem, 1983) . However, the isolation and characterisation of such antibodies has not been achieved on the monoclonal level using conventional hybridoma technology (Ko \u00c8 hler & Milstein, 1975) . We have previously shown that human anti-idiotypic antibodies against human IgE can be isolated from a non-immune repertoire using phage display technology (Vogel et al., 1994) . Here, we used the same technology to isolate human anti-idiotypic Fab fragments able to mimic an epitope from the constant part of human IgE. To de\u00aene such an epitope, we used a monoclonal anti-human (mAb) IgE antibody, termed BSW17 (Knutti-Mueller et al., 1986) . With this mAb we had screened phage-displayed random peptide libraries and isolated peptides mimicking an epitope located in the third and fourth constant domain of IgE (Rudolf et al., 1998 (Rudolf et al., , 2000 . Here, we address the question of whether it would be possible to isolate an anti-idiotypic antibody that mimics the same epitope ( Figure 1) .\n\nTo \u00aend the anti-idiotypic antibodies, we searched in combinatorial Fab libraries generated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of allergic and non-allergic donors (Vogel et al., 1994) , and of puri\u00aeed B-cells from children's tonsils. RNA was extracted from each source and used independently to prepare PCR-ampli\u00aeed cDNA corresponding to the variable heavy chain immunoglobulin (Ig) region and a part of the constant region of IgG1 (Fd) and the Ig light chains k and l. The cDNAs were cloned into the pComb3 vector system, and Fab libraries from the three different sources were expressed separately on the surface of \u00aelamentous phage and then pooled for further use. To select anti-Id antibodies speci\u00aec for BSW17, the pooled libraries were subjected to four rounds of biopanning on solid-phase BSW17 (Marks et al., 1991) . After the last round of panning, eight positive clones were selected out of 50 clones, and all of them recognised the antigenbinding site of BSW17. This was demonstrated in an inhibition assay where the binding of the Fab clones to BSW17 was inhibited by the two previously isolated IgE mimotopes corresponding to the third and fourth domain of IgE (data not shown).\n\nTo delineate the regions on anti-Id Fabs responsible for mimicking IgE structures, the nucleotide sequences of the heavy and light chain variable domains from the selected clones were determined . Sequence analysis revealed that only two types of Fab clones were isolated. Figure 2 shows the deduced amino acid sequences of the two anti-Id Fab clones compared with the most homologous germline genes. The two Fab clones (anti-Id-BSW17.52 and anti-Id-BSW17.43) showed the highest level of homology to two genes derived from different VH families, 22-2 B from VH3 and DP-65 from VH4. The VH CDR3 regions of both clones were also markedly different in length and sequence, suggesting that they originated from two different B-cell clones. Further, the light chains of these Fab clones were homologous to two different germline genes belonging to different families, Vk1 and Vl1 ( Figure 2 ). The V-genes of both clones showed several differences from the germline V-gene segments, suggesting that they are derived from somatically mutated B-cells. As the source of our immunoglobulin genes was a pool of three donors, we cannot conclude whether the anti-idiotypic speci\u00aecities were derived from one individual or whether both speci\u00aecities may actually be present in all three donors.\n\nTo further characterise the epitope speci\u00aecity of the anti-Id-BSW17 Fab clones, soluble Fab fragments were produced and analysed in a competitive binding assay against the mAb BSW17. The mAb BSW17 has been shown to recognise IgE on the surface of CHO cells expressing the a chain of and FR (framework regions) and compared to the most homologous germline protein sequences. The sequence data are available from EMBL Genbank under the numbers AJ249736 and AJ249791 for the heavy chains of clones anti-Id-BSW17.52 and anti-Id-BSW17.43, respectively, and AJ249737 and AJ249792 for the light chains of clones anti-Id-BSW17.52 and anti-Id-BSW17.43, respectively. the FceRI receptor (CHOa) . \u0100 ow cytometric assay was used to determine whether the anti-Id-BSW17 Fab clones were able to inhibit the binding of BSW17 to IgE-primed CHOa cells. The CHOa cells were \u00aerst incubated with a monoclonal human IgE (Zu \u00c8 rcher et al., 1995) , followed by incubation with preformed complexes of BSW17 and soluble anti-Id-BSW17 Fab fragments. As shown in Figure 3 , the binding of BSW17 to CHOa cells decreased with increasing concentrations of anti-Id-BSW17 Fab fragments, indicating that the two anti-Id-BSW17 Fab clones were able to inhibit the binding of BSW17 to IgE. These results imply that the two anti-Id-BSW17 Fab clones mimic epitope regions on IgE recognised by the mAb BSW17.\n\nTo determine the epitopes on IgE mimicked by the anti-Id-BSW17 Fabs, their amino acid sequences were compared with the constant e chain amino acid sequence using the homology search function algorithm developed by Lipman & Pearson (1985) . As shown in Figure 4 (a), the heavy chains of both anti-Id Fab clones showed homology with the third heavy chain constant domain of the IgE molecule (Ce3). Sequence comparison revealed a 46 % identity (dark green) and 73 % similarity (light green) between the residues 370 and 383 of Ce3 and a region of anti-Id-BSW17.52 comprising the \u00aerst complementarity-determining region (CDR1) and a part of the adjacent framework (FR2). For anti-Id-BSW17.43, values of 31 % identity (dark blue) and 67 % similarity (light blue) were obtained between residues 355 and 383 of Ce3 and a sequence of 29 amino acid residues encompassing the CDR1 and a part of the adjacent frameworks (FR1 and FR2). Remarkably, the previously isolated Ce3 peptide mimotope speci\u00aec to BSW17 revealed homology with a similar region of the Ce3 domain corresponding to residues Val370 to Ser375 (Figure 4 (a); Rudolf et al., 2000) .\n\nTo visualise the epitopes responsible for the observed mimicry on IgE, the sequences were aligned with a homology-based three-dimensional computer model of the IgE molecule developed for human Fce on the basis of sequence homology with Fcg (Padlan & Davies, 1986; Helm et al., 1991) . Visual and computational analysis revealed that the VH of both Fab clones, as well as a part of the Ce3 mimotope, share sequence homology and mimic a common IgE epitope covering the region from Thr373 to Asn383 (Figure 4(a) ). This common epitope emerges on the surface of the IgE molecule and has considerable surface solvent accessibility. These data, and the fact that structural analysis of the common epitope revealed a b-turn, support the prediction that this region is antigenic (Chou et al., 1978) and is recognised by BSW17 as described by Knutti-Mueller et al. (1986) . Furthermore, this region has been reported to overlap with the possible IgE-binding site of the high-af\u00aenity IgE receptor. Using alanine scanning mutagenesis, two amino acid residues (Arg376, Ser378) present in this region were found to be directly involved in high-af\u00aenity receptor binding (Presta et al., 1994; Helm et al., 1996) .\n\nThe heavy chains and the light chains of both anti-Id-BSWS17 Fab clones showed homology with additional regions in the third domain of IgE (Figure 4(b) ). For anti-Id-BSW17.52, alignment showed 38 % identity (dark purple) and 75 % similarity (light purple) between the residues 343-358 of Ce3 and a region mapping the \u00aerst framework (FR1). Similarly, the anti-Id-BSW17.43 revealed values of 36 % identity (dark red) and 65 % simi- To produce soluble anti-Id BSW17.52 and anti-Id BSW17.43 Fabs, the gIII sequence was replaced by six histidine residues at the carboxy-terminal end of the Fab. After transformation in XL1-Blue, single clones were chosen for Fab large-scale production. Puri\u00aecation of Fab was performed using a nickel-nitriloacetate column (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A series of test samples containing 5 \u00c2 10 4 CHOa cells were incubated in Facs buffer (PBS, 0.3 % bovine serum albumin, 0.02 % NaN 3 ) with 48 ng of a monoclonal human IgE (Zu \u00c8 rcher et al., 1995) for 20 minutes at room temperature. After washing once with Facs buffer, each sample was incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature with preformed complexes of\u00afuoresceine isothiocyanate conjugated BSW17 (BSW17-FITC) and anti-Id-BSW17 Fabs. The complexes were prepared as followed: 50 ml of BSW17-FITC at a concentration of 1.3 nM were incubated with different concentrations of anti-Id-BSW17 Fabs (40 nM, 200 nM, 1 mM, 4 mM and 40 mM) for 30 minutes at room temperature. A control sample containing only the CHOa cells was incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature with BSW17-FITC for determination of non-speci\u00aec binding. The CHOa cells were washed once with Facs buffer and after addition of 150 ml of Facs buffer the cells were analysed in FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson)\u00afow cytometer equipped with an argon laser tuned to 488 nm. Gates in the forward scatter/side scatter dot blot were set around monomeric cells, and\u00afuorescence was quanti-\u00aeed and expressed as mean channel\u00afuorescence (mcf). The percentage of positive cells was calculated as the percentage of BSW17 binding to CHOa cells. larity (light red) between the region of Ce3 covering the residues from 413 to 438 and a region encompassing CDR1 and the adjacent framework (FR2). The homologous region of this anti-Id-BSW17.43 light chain appears to span over the common epitope (Figure 4(b) ) mimicked by the heavy chains of both anti-Id Fabs, suggesting that for this second anti-Id the light chain might be involved in the antigen mimicry. Furthermore, two residues, Arg427 and Met430, present in this homologous region have been shown by Presta et al. (1994) to lie within the hinge-proximal-bend of IgE and to be critical for the binding of IgE to FceRI. Using the IAsys system (Horn et al., 1999) the K d of anti-Id-BSW17.52 and anti-Id-BSW17.43 for BSW17 was determined as 3.5 \u00c2 10 8 M \u00c01 and 2.4 \u00c2 10 8 M \u00c01 , respectively, which compares well with values for antibodies obtained by other techniques, such as hybridoma technology (Ko \u00c8 hler & Milstein, 1975) .\n\nThe observed structural mimicry implies that our two anti-Id BSW17 Fab clones might serve as immunogens by providing a``simulated'' epitope of IgE and inducing a``BSW17-like anti-IgE'' antibody response. To assess this functional mimicry, two rabbits were immunised with soluble anti-Id-BSW17.52 and anti-Id-BSW17.43 Fab preparations four times at two-week intervals; after seven weeks, the sera were tested for anti-IgE activity. Because the Ce3 epitope region, mimicked by the heavy and light chains of both anti-Id Fab clones, has been shown to be involved in high-af\u00aenity receptor binding, the antibodies raised against the two anti-Id Fab clones were expected to inhibit binding of IgE to its high-af\u00aenity receptor by blocking the IgEbinding domain. To assess this inhibitory activity, the rabbit antisera were \u00aerst af\u00aenity-puri\u00aeed on human IgE and then tested in an inhibition ELISA. Figure 5 shows that the two puri\u00aeed rabbit IgG preparations inhibit the binding of IgE to the a-chain of FceRI. However, the af\u00aenity-puri\u00aeed IgG of the rabbit immunised with the second anti-Id BSW17.43 Fab showed a stronger inhibition of IgE binding to the a-chain than the IgG puri\u00aeed from the rabbit immunised with the \u00aerst anti-Id BSW17.52 Fab. Using surface plasmon resonance in the BIAcore system (Malborg et al., 1996) , the af\u00aenity of both puri-\u00aeed IgG preparations to human IgE was determined. The polyclonal anti-anti-idiotypic IgG preparation puri\u00aeed from the rabbits immunised with anti-Id BSW17.52 and anti-Id BSW17.43 bound to human IgE with K d of 6 \u00c2 10 9 M \u00c01 and of 4 \u00c2 10 10 M \u00c01 , respectively. This result suggests that both anti-Id can act as a functional image of the IgE molecule. Accordingly, the anti-Id BSW17.43 Fab, which shows the closest molecular mimicry to the IgE molecule, induces antibodies in vivo with the greatest inhibitory effect and the highest af\u00aenity to the IgE molecule. Figure 5 . Inhibition of FceRIa chain binding to IgE by BSW17 and by BSW17 like rabbit anti-anti-Id IgG preparations. Preparation of rabbit anti-anti-Id IgG. Two New Zealand white female rabbits were given a primary immunisation subcutaneously with 300 mg/ml of either soluble anti-Id BSW17.52 or anti-Id BSW17.43 Fabs emulsi\u00aeed 1:1 in Freund's complete adjuvant and then boosted three times with the same amount of Fab emulsi\u00aeed 1:1 in Freund's incomplete adjuvant every two weeks. Animals were bled seven days after the last injection. To purify rabbit serum, the IgG fraction was \u00aerst isolated by precipitation in 45 % saturated ammonium sulphate. After resuspension and dialysis against PBS at 4 C, Fab was puri\u00aeed on an af\u00aenity column (CH-Sepharose 4B, Pharmacia, LKB Biotechnology, Inc., Piscataway, NJ) coupled to human IgE. The dialysed fraction was \u00aeltered on a 0.2 mm MILLEX-GV \u00aelter unit (Millipore) and applied to the column equilibrated with PBS at a\u00afow rate of 2 ml/minute. Th\u0113 owthrough was pooled and, after washing with PBS, the IgG was eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 2.8) and neutralised immediately with 3.3 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The fractions containing the IgG were pooled, concentrated and extensively dialysed against PBS. The quantity of puri\u00aeed IgG was determined using the Bradford assay, BIgG Standard (BioRad). Inhibition assay. Microtititer plate wells were coated with 1 mg/ml of a mouse anti-human IgE mAb Le27 (Knutti-Muller et al., 1986) for 16 hours at 4 C. After \u00aeve washes in PBS/0.05 % Tween-20, wells were incubated for two hours at 37 C with complexes preformed for 16 hours at 4 C by a monoclonal human IgE (Zu \u00c8 rcher et al., 1995) at a concentration of 50 ng/ml and increasing concentrations of BSW17 (open squares), rabbit anti-anti-Id BSW17.52 IgG (\u00aelled circles) and rabbit anti-anti-Id BSW17.43 IgG (\u00aelled triangles). After washing, 100 ng/ml of peroxidase-labelled recombinant FceRI (Nechansky et al., 1997) was added for a second incubation of two hours at 37 C. The wells were washed, and the amount of bound FceRIa chain was determined by colour reaction using chromogenic o-phenylene diamine dihydrochloride (OPD; Sigma) OPD substrate. Results were calculated as percentage binding of FceRIa chain to IgE in the presence (B) or the absence of competitor (B0) multiplied by 100.\n\nAlthough functional mimicry has been reported for some anti-idiotypic antibodies mimicking self antigens, there have been no studies to date that have demonstrated structural similarity between self antigens and human anti-idiotypic antibodies. Mouse monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies that mimic self structures have already been reported (Lubahn et al., 1990; Taub et al., 1992; Abrams et al., 1992; Garcia et al., 1992; Perosa et al., 1994) . Garcia et al. (1992) described a system using angiotensin which is a phylogenetically conserved octapeptide and thus can be considered as a self antigen. In this system, rabbit polyclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab2) speci\u00aec to a monoclonal anti-angiotensin (Ab1) were used to obtain anti-anti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab3). The conformation of the angiotensin in the complex with Ab3 has suggested that a CDR of the Ab2 could have elicited the angiotensin-speci\u00aec Ab3. However, due to the polyclonal nature of the anti-idiotypic antibodies, no structural study of Ab2 was performed to con\u00aerm this hypothesis. In our system we have isolated two human monoclonal human anti-idotypic antibodies and demonstrated amino acid sequence-based structural homology by identifying the cross-reactive residues responsible for the mimicry. Additionally, we have shown that neither immunisation nor af\u00aenity maturation is a prerequisite for generating high-af\u00aenity anti-idiotypic antibodies from phage display libraries. Recently, the isolation of human recombinant anti-idiotypic scFv against coronavirus from a non-immune phage display library has been reported (Lamarre & Talbot, 1997) . However, these scFv antibodies were not able to induce an antiviral immune response suf\u00aeciently strong to protect immunised animals. In our case, the fact that two human anti-idiotypic Fab fragments behaved as surrogate antigens and induced an anti-IgE response in rabbits may circumvent the problem of using non-human antibodies in humans. Preliminary results of monkey immunisations have shown that the anti-idiotypic antibodies can induce an anti-IgE response that is able to abolish partially reactivity in an in vivo passive cutaneous anaphylaxis test in the case of allergen challenge. Thus, the anti-idiotypic antibodies can be used as an active vaccine analogous to the IgE mimotope peptides that have been previously isolated and are currently in the preclinical testing phase. Clearly, the anti-idiotypic antibodies represent a much larger epitope of IgE than the mimotope derived from random phage peptide libraries. Moreover, in a vaccination procedure these antiidiotypic antibodies may be better tolerated than peptides that have to be coupled to immunogenic carriers. Thus, it can be expected that in humans the anti-idiotypic antibodies will induce, as already seen in monkeys, an anti-IgE immune response that would prevent binding of IgE to the FceRI, and consequently the sensitisation of the effector cells implicated in allergic disease."}
