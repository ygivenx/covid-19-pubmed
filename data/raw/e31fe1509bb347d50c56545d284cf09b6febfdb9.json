{"title": "Budding Yeast SKP1 Encodes an Evolutionarily Conserved Kinetochore Protein Required for Cell Cycle Progression", "body": "gene encoding p58 of CBF3, as a starting point. In this paper, we describe the identification of the SKP1 gene as a dosage suppressor of a ctf13-30 mutant. Genetic and biochemical analysis indicates that the 22.3 kDa Skp1 protein is a fourth subunit of CBF3 that was previously unrecognized. Unlike the other CBF3 components, Skp1p is a highly conserved protein found in multicellular eukaryotes. Furthermore, Skp1p has recently been shown to be a component of a cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) complex purified from transformed human fibroblasts and to interact directly with Cdc4p and cyclin F through a novel structural motif (Bai et al., 1996 [this issue of Cell]). We conclude that Skp1p is involved in both structural and regulatory functions and may provide a direct link between the kinetochore and the cell cycle machinery.\n\nTo identify further additional components of the S. cerevisiae kinetochore, we performed a screen for dosage suppressors of the temperature sensitivity caused by the ctf13-30 mutation. A 2 genomic library was transformed into a ctf13-30 mutant, and temperature-resis- clone to suppress the temperature-sensitive and chromosome missegregation phenotypes of a ctf13-30 musmall size of Skp1p, it was possible that it represented a tant. When the gene disruption was integrated into the previously unrecognized subunit of CBF3. To determine genome, dissection of a heterozygous diploid resulted whether this was the case, we made two epitope-tagged in viability segregating 2\u03e9:2\u03ea (see Experimental Proceconstructs of Skp1p (see Experimental Procedures).

As controls, extracts were also 58 kDa in size. CBF3 binds in vitro to a 100 bp DNA probe prepared from a ctf13-\u232c1 deletion strain carrying epithat spans CDEIII but lacks CDEI and CDEII (Doheny et tope-tagged Ctf13p. DNA-protein complexes were allowed to form with 32 P-labeled CDEIII sequence, and al., 1993; see Experimental Procedures). Because of the DNA-protein complexes formed with 32 Plabeled CDEIII probe and whole-cell extracts were analyzed on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (Doheny et al., 1993). Antibodies were added to preformed complexes, and samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature before gel analysis. Unbound probe was run off the bottom of the gel. (A) Lanes 1, 2, and 11 are controls. Lanes 3-6, extracts from cells containing E1-tagged or untagged Ctf13p or Skp1p proteins demonstrating an intrinsic mobility shift due to the 60 amino acid epitope fusion in each case. Lanes 7-10, extracts from cells containing E1-tagged Ctf13p or Skp1p subsequently incubated with or without antibodies directed against the E1 epitope as indicated. Lanes 7 and 9 are controls for lanes 8 and 10. (B) Lanes 1-6, extracts containing either HAtagged or untagged Ctf13p or Skp1p subsequently incubated with or without an antibody directed against the HA epitope as indicated.

Lane 9 is a control.\n\ncomplexes were resolved on a nondenaturing gel (Figure polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in vitro and gap repair in vivo (see Experimental Procedures). The four alleles 2). In the absence of anti-E1 antibody, extracts containing the E1 epitope-tagged fusions of Ctf13p and were named skp1-1, skp1-2, skp1-3, and skp1-4. The nucleotide sequence of each allele was determined (see Skp1p show a slight (but clearly observable and reproducible) intrinsic mobility shift up when compared with Experimental Procedures), and the mutations encoding changes at the protein level were found to be primarily wild-type and untagged extracts (Figure 2A, lanes 2-6) , suggesting that the E1-Skp1p fusion protein is localized in the carboxyl terminus of the protein (see Table 1 ). Chromosome missegregation was monitored visually to the complex. The magnitude of the intrinsic shift is identical for E1-tagged Ctf13p and E1-tagged Skp1p, in each skp1 temperature-sensitive strain at semi-permissive temperature using a colony color assay that indicating equal stoichiometry of these two proteins in the CBF3 complex. When E1 antibody is added to com-measures the stability of a marker chromosome fragment (Hieter et al., 1985) . By this criterion, the strains fell plexes formed using extracts from tagged and untagged Ctf13p and Skp1p strains, a supershift is observed using into two classes. Strains expressing the skp1-1, skp1-2, or skp1-3 alleles exhibited wild-type rates of chromo-the Ctf13p-tagged extract ( Figure 2A , lane 8) and the E1-tagged Skp1p extract, although the supershift with some missegregation. The strain expressing skp1-4, however, exhibited a dramatically increased rate of E1-tagged Skp1p was less pronounced (Figure 2A , lane 10). These results suggested that Skp1p is in the CBF3 chromosome missegregation comparable with that observed for the ctf13-30 mutant. We therefore decided complex, as evidenced by both the intrinsic and antibody-induced mobility shift; however, epitope accessi-to analyze further strains carrying one mutation in each class (skp1-3 and skp1-4).

Loss of the nonessential marker chromosome gives a red sector in a white colony. skp1-3 mutants exhibit a wild-type phenotype (very rarely sectored colonies) when transformed with vector only. skp1-4 mutants exhibit dramatically increased rates of chromosome loss (highly sectored colonies) when transformed with vector only. Introduction of the CTF13 gene on a low copy (CEN) vector or high copy (2) vector suppresses the chromosome missegregation phenotype of the skp1-4 mutant. Introduction of the NDC10 gene on a 2 vector has no effect. complementation data described above, the skp1-3/ budded phenotype accounting for 37% of the cell population. It appears that skp1-3 cells do not replicate their skp1-4 heteroallelic diploid exhibits DNA content profiles similar to wild type in logarithmically growing cells DNA (arrest with a G1 DNA content), but continue the budding process.

We describe the identification of quence is identical to the sequence of p19 , which is a component of a cyclin A-CDK2 a fourth intrinsic subunit of CBF3, Skp1p, which was isolated by screening for dosage suppressors of a complex purified from transformed human fibroblasts. Coincidentally, the gene encoding human p19 was also known kinetochore protein mutant. The discovery of Skp1p is of broad significance for several reasons.

In addition, a search of the nonredundant protein database addition to its essential structural role at the kinetochore, analysis of skp1 mutants suggest a role in cell (NRDB) revealed three sequences with high similarity to Skp1p: OCP-II (Chen et al., 1995), FP21 (West et al., cycle progression at both G2/M and G1/S.

FP21 is a glycoprotein of unknown function in Dictyo-chore protein) is the homolog of human SKP1 (S phase kinase-associated protein), which is a subunit of a cyclin stelium and appears to have an unusual glycosylation\n\nSeveral lines of evidence indicate that Skp1p is a 22.3 species. Recently, a mouse gene encoding a Skp1p homolog was cloned and related sequences were kDa subunit of the CBF3 complex. First, increased expression of SKP1 suppresses the temperature-sensitive mapped to two locations in the mouse genome, one corresponding to the cloned gene and the other to a lethality and chromosome missegregation phenotype caused by ctf13-30, a missense mutation in the 58 kDa cross-hybridizing sequence (Chen et al., 1995) . It is possible that one of these represents a pseudogene, al-subunit of CBF3. Second, SKP1 is an essential gene, and the temperature-sensitive mutation skp1-4 causes though this point needs clarification. In C. elegans, however, SKP1-related ESTs were derived from two phenotypes similar to those observed in a ctf13 mutant, including chromosome missegregation at semi-permis-nonidentical mRNA sequences (only one of which was sequenced to completion and reported here). The hu-sive temperature and a terminal phenotype at nonpermissive temperature indicative of a defect in the G2/M man genome may therefore contain a single functional SKP1 gene or, alternatively, two functional genes, one phase of the cell cycle.

The intrinsic mobility shift data (Figure quence is identical to a sequence reported by for p19 SKP1 , a protein that copurifies with a 2A) indicate that Skp1p and Ctf13p are present at an equimolar ratio. Addition of a 60 amino acid segment p9-p45 SKP2 -cyclin A-CDK2 complex derived from transformed fibroblasts. Although addition of p45 or p45 and to either Skp1p or Ctf13p results in an identical mobility change for the CBF3-CEN DNA complex in the absence p19 to cyclin A-CDK2 complexes had no effect on kinase activity in vitro, microinjection of anti-p45 antibody into of added anti-epitope antibody. Exact comigration of these complexes has been confirmed in extended elec-cultured cells prevented entry into S phase.

It will therefore be of interest to determine the effects of mad and bub mutants on the of a kinetochore checkpoint (Campbell and Gorbsky, 1995). As suggested previously (Li and Nicklas, 1995; skp1-4-mediated G2/M delay.\n\nThe allele-specific G1/S arrest observed in skp1-3 mu-Gorbsky, 1995), eventual achievement of bipolar attachtants appears to be distinct from the G1 arrest observed ment could, through mechanical tension on the kinetoin cdc28 mutants.
