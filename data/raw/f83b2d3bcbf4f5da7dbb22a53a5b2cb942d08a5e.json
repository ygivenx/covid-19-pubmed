{"title": "Protocol for a randomised, single-blind, two-arm, parallel- group controlled trial of the efficacy of rhinothermy delivered by nasal high flow therapy in the treatment of the common cold Protocol for a randomised, single-blind, two-arm, parallel-group controlled trial of the efficacy of rhinothermy delivered by nasal high flow therapy in the treatment of the common cold", "body": "The common cold is the most common infectious disease affecting humans. [1] The common cold is a viral upper respiratory tract infection with typical symptoms that include: nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea, sneezing, sore throat, and cough. [2] Many viruses cause the common cold but Human Rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most frequent pathogen. [3] On average, adults have two to four colds per year. [2] The mean duration of symptoms of the common cold is reported to be between seven and ten days and it is usually a self-limiting disease. [2] However, the common cold can cause significant morbidity and has a substantial economic impact on society. In the USA alone, non-influenza viral respiratory tract infections cause an estimated 20 million lost workdays, 110 million physician visits, and 6 million emergency department visits annually, [4] producing an economic burden of $40 billion each year. [4] Furthermore, HRV infection poses particular risks to those with other comorbidities such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), where they are a major cause of disease exacerbations. [5, 6] No effective treatment has been identified for the common cold and current treatments are mainly symptomatic. There are many cold remedies marketed and, for example, in the USA an estimated $2.9 billion are spent on over-the-counter medications for the common cold annually. [4] Amongst the treatment used are: zinc, vitamin C, nasal decongestants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), echinacea, antihistamines, antibiotics and heated, humidified air. The evidence for the effectiveness of many of these is inconclusive or, at most, demonstrates limited benefit for symptom reduction. [3] Rhinothermy HRVs cause up to two thirds of colds, and importantly for the hypothesis tested in this research, have temperature-dependent replication. [7] The antiviral effect of temperature on HRVs has been investigated in vitro. [8] [9] [10] [11] Replication of most HRV strains is optimal between 33 and 35\u00b0C, [7] which is the normal physiological temperature of the upper airways. [7] Studies report that raising the nasal mucosal temperature may inhibit viral replication [8] and this may be a treatment strategy to attenuate the severity and duration of common cold symptoms. Forstall and colleagues report that the greatest inhibition of HRV occurs when exposed to a temperature of 43\u00b0C for at least one hour [7] F o r p e e r r e v i e w o n l y and Conti and colleagues report that HRV replication is suppressed when exposed to a temperature of 45\u00b0C for 20 minutes. [9] Rhinothermy is the delivery of heated, humidified air to the upper airways via the nasal passages.\n\nStudies conducted in vivo have delivered heated and humidified air to participants at a range of temperatures, from 40 to 44\u00b0C, [8, [12] [13] [14] [15] and using a variety of devices, including an anaesthetic mask [12] and steam-venting nozzles held a distance away from the nares. [8, [13] [14] [15] These delivery systems may be inefficient and inconsistently deliver humidified air to the upper airways at the desired temperatures. A recent Cochrane systematic review of six rhinothermy studies in which participants with the common cold were treated with heated, humidified air did not show any harms or benefits, but advised cautious interpretation of the evidence, concluding that its quality was low grade. [1] The review recommended that further double-blind randomised controlled trials are needed, which provide definitive diagnosis derived from viral cultures and use uniform symptom scores. [1] It is evident that future trials should use standardised treatment modalities which effectively and consistently raise the temperature of the upper airways for the duration of treatment.\n\nThe technical difficulties in delivering heated, humidified air to the upper airways in an efficient and tolerable manner have been overcome with the nasal high flow rhinothermy (rNHF) device manufactured by Fisher and Paykel Healthcare Ltd (Auckland, New Zealand). This device can consistently deliver high-flow humidified air heated to 41\u00b0C to the upper airways. The device is well tolerated and acceptable to adults. [16] A recent feasibility study recruited 30 participants with symptoms of the common cold into a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of five days of rNHF therapy or Vitamin C with the main patient reported outcome measure, the Modified Jackson Score. [17] The rNHF therapy delivered 100% humidified air at 35L/min and 41\u00b0C for two hours daily. Compared to Vitamin C, rNHF treatment caused a clinically significant five unit reduction in the Modified Jackson Score.\n\nFollowing this feasibility study we plan to undertake a definitive, adequately powered RCT to investigate the effectiveness of rNHF treatment in the management of the common cold. \n\nFive days of nasal high flow rhinothermy (rNHF) therapy, is more effective in reducing symptom severity and duration of the common cold than five days of 'sham' rhinothermy.\n\nThis randomised, single-blind, parallel-groups trial which will compare five days of rNHF therapy (100% humidified air at 35L/min and 41 o C for two hours daily), with 'sham' rhinothermy therapy (100% humidified air at 10L/min and 31 o C for ten minutes daily) in the treatment of the common cold.\n\nWe plan to recruit 170 participants within 48 hours of the onset of specific symptoms of the common cold. Participants will be randomised 1:1 to receive one of the two possible treatment arms and will receive this treatment for the first five days of the study. Study visits will occur on Day 1 and Day 5 with a follow-up phone call on Day 14. The patient reported outcome measure will be the Modified Jackson Score (MJS). [18, 19] \n\nAll study data will be collected and recorded using the electronic data capture tool REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). [20] The MJS on Day 1 will be collected by the investigator as part of the screening visit. After this participants will complete a daily symptom diary, including a daily MJS, remotely, and will enter this data directly into either an electronic case report form (eCRF) on REDCap, or on paper.\n\n\u2022 Aged 18 to 75 years.\n\n\u2022 In the Investigator's opinion, is able and willing to comply with all trial requirements.\n\n\u2022 Onset of symptoms within the last 48 hours at time of consent.\n\n\u2022 MJS of \u2265 7. \u2022 Nasal conditions such as deviated septum, chronic rhinitis, which the investigator considers could impair nasal breathing.\n\n\u2022 Current use of or requirement for oral antibiotics for respiratory tract infection, pneumonia, or infective exacerbation of underlying respiratory condition.\n\n\u2022 Current use of or requirement for parenteral antibiotics.\n\n\u2022 Daily intra-nasal or inhaled steroids will be allowed if part of the participant's regular therapy. If not taken prior to enrolment, they should be withheld for the duration of this study.\n\n\u2022 Have an implantable medical device.\n\n\u2022 Have a notifiable disease.\n\n\u2022 Have existing travel plans that require them to leave the greater Wellington region during the first 5 days of the study, the period during which the participant will be using the rhinothermy device.\n\n\u2022 A current diagnosis of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other significant respiratory conditions. (Participants who have not had asthma symptoms nor any requirement for asthma medication within the last 12 months, will be eligible for inclusion in the study.)\n\n\u2022 A positive GeneXpert\u00ae point-of-care test for Influenza A or B.\n\n\u2022 The investigator believes the participant or their care giver will be unable to safely use rNHF without medical supervision.\n\n\u2022 Have any other condition which, at the investigator's discretion, is believed may present a safety risk or impact the feasibility of the study or the study results. \n\nThe initial screening visit will take place at the MRINZ study clinic and involves:\n\n1. Calculation of symptom duration and the Day 1 (baseline) MJS 2. Assessment for the presence of exclusion criteria.\n\n3. Obtaining past medical, surgical, smoking, allergy and medication history.\n\nCollection of a nasopharyngeal specimens to exclude influenza A or B viruses.\n\nA physical examination to ensure that there are no physical health issues which may exclude the participant from the study.\n\nInformed consent will be obtained prior to screening and again prior to enrolment in the study for eligible participants. Participants will sign electronic consent forms on REDCap.\n\nNasopharyngeal specimens will be obtained during the screening visit using Copan's flocked swabs (FLOQSwabs\u2122) . These specimens will be tested for the presence of influenza type A or B virus nucleic acid using the GeneXpert\u00ae Xpress Flu/RSV point-of-care test (Cepheid, Ca, USA). The sensitivity and specificity of real-time PCR using the GeneXpert\u00ae Xpress Flu/RSV point-of-care test, for the rapid diagnosis of influenza virus has been reported as 97.8% and 100% respectively. [21] Nasopharyngeal specimens obtained from enrolled participants will also be sent to Canterbury A permuted block randomisation method stratified by duration of illness, lesser versus greater than or equal to one day, will be used to allocate participants to either treatment arm. The computergenerated sequence will be supplied by the study statistician, independent of the investigators. The eCRF system will conceal the allocations and will release a participant's randomisation outcome at the time of randomisation. The randomisation schedule will only be accessed by the study statistician and the eCRF provider; study staff will not have access to the randomisation schedule.\n\nThere are two randomised treatments: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n l y encouraged to self-administer the 'sham' rhinothermy in a single 10 minute session on each day of treatment.\n\nIn contrast to the recent feasibility study, 'sham' rhinothermy will be used as the control rather than Vitamin C. The use of 'Sham' rhinothermy in the control arm will provide the advantage of masking participants to treatment allocation and will control for any placebo effect associated with the use of a rhinothermy device. The rationale for the 'sham' device settings is to produce a treatment which is unlikely to have any therapeutic effect. For respiratory pathogens with temperature-dependent replication, a temperature of 31\u00b0C should not inhibit viral replication.\n\nGeneral and safety checks will be completed on each device before they are provided for use.\n\nParticipants will also be asked to read through the relevant device warnings and personally sign and date these to document that they have read and understood them.\n\nBoth the intervention and control devices automatically record device use data electronically.\n\nAdherence to the rNHF and 'sham' rhinothermy treatments will be assessed by investigator review of these data. Adherence to rNHF will be defined as a minimum of 90 minutes use per day, delivered in no more than 2 sessions per day. Adherence to 'sham' rhinothermy will be defined as a minimum of 6 minutes use per day, delivered in no more than a single session.\n\nThe Day 1 MJS will be calculated as part of the screening visit and participants will be asked to complete a daily symptom diary online for the subsequent 13 days. The links to the daily symptom diary will be generated by REDCap and sent to the participants via automated email or text. The daily symptom diary data will be entered directly into REDCap by the participants themselves. Those participants without computer or internet access will be provided with paper versions of the daily symptom diary.\n\nUsing an electronic or paper symptom diary (Figure 2 ), participants will document:\n\n\u2022 Daily MJS\n\n\u2022 How they feel each day, either: a lot worse, a little worse, about the same, a little better or a lot better, as compared to Day 1\n\n\u2022 The day during the study when they returned to their usual daily activities. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y \u2022 Use of cold medications/remedies and provide details of these if applicable.\n\nNon-completion of the online symptom diary will trigger a reminder from REDCap.\n\nParticipants will return to the MRINZ study clinic for a second visit to return their devices and complete a tolerability questionnaire regarding their device and treatment. Any new medications, adverse events or device issues will also be reviewed during this visit.\n\nParticipants who have not administered their Day 5 treatment (rNHF /'sham' rhinothermy) at the time of attending will be encouraged to receive the allocated treatment during their Day 5 visit.\n\nThe investigator will download the device use data from the participant's device and upload this into\n\nRedCap.\n\nDay 14 (Follow-up phone call)\n\nParticipants will receive a follow up phone call on the final day of the study (Day 14) to review any new medications, adverse events or device issues and confirm the end of the study. Participants will be asked to provide any feedback they consider appropriate and study reimbursement will be arranged and sent out.\n\nPrimary Objective 1. To estimate the difference in the severity of symptoms of the common cold between rNHF and 'sham' rhinothermy after 4 days and test the hypothesis that rNHF is superior to 'sham' rhinothermy.\n\nPrimary Outcome Measure 2. To estimate the difference in the duration of symptoms of the common cold between 5 days of rNHF and 5 days of 'sham' rhinothermy.\n\n3. To estimate the difference in time to feeling \"a little better\" and \"a lot better\" compared to Day1, between 5 days of rNHF and 5 days of 'sham' rhinothermy.\n\n4. To estimate the difference in time until return to \"normal daily activities\" between 5 days of rNHF and 5 days of 'sham' rhinothermy.\n\n5. To estimate if there is an interaction between any treatment effect and HRV viral status.\n\n\u2022 MJS on Days 2, 3, and 5 to 14 inclusive.\n\n\u2022 Time until feeling \"a little better\" compared to study entry (Day 1).\n\n\u2022 Time until feeling \"a lot better\" compared to study entry (Day 1).\n\n\u2022 Time until resolution of symptoms (defined as the start of a 24 hour period in which the MJS was \u22641 and remained so for 24 hours).\n\n\u2022 Time until return to normal daily activities, as recorded in the daily symptom diary.\n\n\u2022 MJS on Day 4, in those participants whose nasopharyngeal specimens are HRV positive. \u2022 Tolerability questionnaire results.\n\n\u2022 Device use data downloaded from the rNHF device.\n\nStatistical analyses will use the intention to treat principle and all participants who are randomised will be included in the analysis. The primary comparison is between rNHF treatment and 'sham' rhinothermy treatment. The primary outcome variable will be analysed by ANCOVA with Day 1 (baseline) MJS as the covariate. An interaction analysis will be used to assess evidence that there are different treatment outcomes for those participants who test positive for HRV. The Type I error rate for the primary analysis will be at a P-value of 0.05.\n\nAny deviation(s) from the original statistical plan will be described and justified in the protocol or final report, as appropriate.\n\nIn our recent randomised control trial of rNHF compared to Vitamin C a 5-unit reduction in MJS represented a substantial clinical benefit. [16] The upper confidence limit for the standard deviation in this trial was 6.6. A sample size of 76 in each group allows the detection of a difference of 3.5 units, with 90% power and a Type I error rate of 5%. Allowing for a 10% dropout rate, a total of 85 participants will be randomised to each group.\n\nThere will not be an interim analysis.\n\nThis protocol has been approved by the Health and Disability Ethics Committees of New Zealand and \n\nThe Investigator will ensure that this trial is conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice.\n\nAll adverse events and device deficiencies will be reported to the study sponsor in accordance with current local and national adverse events reporting policies. The sponsor will manage device deficiency reports as part of its ongoing post-marketing safety review process.\n\nThe sponsor will report all adverse events and relevant investigational device deficiencies to the regulatory authorities and Principal Investigator (PI) within the required time period, in accordance with current reporting requirements.\n\nA Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be appointed to review all SAEs on an expedited basis. To ensure adequate study safety, they will review enrolments, withdrawals, and AEs every six months. The DSMC may recommend to the sponsor that the study should be terminated, however the final decision will be made by the sponsor.\n\nThe PI and corresponding author will have full access to the study data and final responsibility for submitting the report for publication. The PI will also take responsibility for reporting the results to those participants who have expressed that they would like to receive the study results. The sponsor will have no involvement in collection, analysis and interpretation of data; preparation of the report;\n\nor decision to submit for publication.

It is usually a selflimiting disease, however the common cold can cause significant morbidity and has a substantial economic impact on society. Human rhinoviruses (HRV), which cause up to two thirds of colds, have temperature-dependent replication and most HRV strains replicate optimally at 33\u00b0C. Delivery of heated, humidified air to the upper airways has the potential to reduce viral replication, but evidence of the effectiveness of this treatment of the common cold is inconclusive. We plan to test the hypothesis that delivery of humidified air heated to 41\u00b0C at high flow, nasal high flow rhinothermy (rNHF), for two hours daily for five days, is more effective in reducing common cold symptom severity and duration, than five days of 'sham' rhinothermy.\n\nThis is a randomised, single-blind, parallel-groups trial comparing rNHF to 'sham' rhinothermy in the treatment of common cold. We plan to recruit 170 participants within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms of common cold and randomise them 1:1 to receive one of the two treatments for five days. The study duration is 14 days, which includes clinic visits on the first day of randomisation and four days post-randomisation, and a phone call on the fourteenth day. Participants will complete daily symptom diaries which include a symptom score, the Modified Jackson Score (MJS). The primary outcome is the Modified Jackson Score (MJS) after four days.\n\nNew Zealand Ethics Registration: 17/STH/174.\n\nResults will be published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, presented at academic meetings and reported to participants. \n\n\uf0b7 The 35L/min flow rate using the rNHF device will enhance delivery of heated, humidified air to the upper airways.\n\n\uf0b7 Use of 'sham' rhinothermy ensures an appropriate control treatment.\n\n\uf0b7 Nasopharyngeal samples allow subgroup analysis of subjects who are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for specific respiratory pathogens.\n\n\uf0b7 It is not possible to blind the investigators to the interventions being administered. \n\nThe common cold is the most common infectious disease affecting humans.

For respiratory pathogens with temperature-dependent replication, a temperature of 31\u00b0C should not inhibit viral replication.\n\nGeneral and safety checks will be completed on each device before they are provided for use.\n\nParticipants will also be asked to read through the relevant device warnings and personally sign and date these to document that they have read and understood them.\n\nBoth the intervention and control devices automatically record device use data electronically.\n\nAdherence to the rNHF and 'sham' rhinothermy treatments will be assessed by investigator review of these data. Adherence to rNHF will be defined as a minimum of 90 minutes use per day, delivered in no more than 2 sessions per day. Adherence to 'sham' rhinothermy will be defined as a minimum of 6 minutes use per day, delivered in no more than a single session.\n\nThe Day 1 MJS will be calculated as part of the screening visit and participants will be asked to complete a daily symptom diary online for the subsequent 13 days. The links to the daily symptom diary will be generated by REDCap and sent to the participants via automated email or text. The daily symptom diary data will be entered directly into REDCap by the participants themselves. Those participants without computer or internet access will be provided with paper versions of the daily symptom diary.\n\nUsing an electronic or paper symptom diary (Figure 1 ), participants will document:\n\n\u2022 Daily MJS\n\n\u2022 How they feel each day, either: a lot worse, a little worse, about the same, a little better or a lot better, as compared to Day 1\n\n\u2022 The day during the study when they returned to their usual daily activities. Non-completion of the online symptom diary will trigger a reminder from REDCap.\n\nParticipants will return to the MRINZ study clinic for a second visit to return their devices and complete a tolerability questionnaire regarding their device and treatment. Any new medications, adverse events or device issues will also be reviewed during this visit.\n\nParticipants who have not administered their Day 5 treatment (rNHF /'sham' rhinothermy) at the time of attending will be encouraged to receive the allocated treatment during their Day 5 visit.\n\nThe investigator will download the device use data from the participant's device and upload this into\n\nRedCap.\n\nDay 14 (Follow-up phone call)\n\nParticipants will receive a follow up phone call on the final day of the study (Day 14) to review any new medications, adverse events or device issues and confirm the end of the study. Participants will be asked to provide any feedback they consider appropriate and study reimbursement will be arranged and sent out.\n\nPrimary Objective 1. To estimate the difference in the severity of symptoms of the common cold between rNHF and 'sham' rhinothermy after 4 days and test the hypothesis that rNHF is superior to 'sham' rhinothermy.\n\nPrimary Outcome Measure 2. To estimate the difference in the duration of symptoms of the common cold between 5 days of rNHF and 5 days of 'sham' rhinothermy.\n\n3. To estimate the difference in time to feeling \"a little better\" and \"a lot better\" compared to Day1, between 5 days of rNHF and 5 days of 'sham' rhinothermy.\n\n4. To estimate the difference in time until return to \"normal daily activities\" between 5 days of rNHF and 5 days of 'sham' rhinothermy.\n\n\u2022 MJS on Days 2, 3, and 5 to 14 inclusive.\n\n\u2022 Time until feeling \"a little better\" compared to study entry (Day 1).\n\n\u2022 Time until feeling \"a lot better\" compared to study entry (Day 1).\n\n\u2022 Time until resolution of symptoms (defined as the start of a 24 hour period in which the MJS was \u22641 and remained so for 24 hours).\n\n\u2022 Time until return to normal daily activities, as recorded in the daily symptom diary.\n\n\u2022 MJS on Day 4, in those participants whose nasopharyngeal specimens are HRV positive. \u2022 Tolerability questionnaire results.\n\n\u2022 Device use data downloaded from the rNHF device.\n\nStatistical analyses will use the intention to treat principle and all participants who are randomised will be included in the analysis. The primary comparison is between rNHF treatment and 'sham' rhinothermy treatment. The primary outcome variable will be analysed by ANCOVA with Day 1 (baseline) MJS as the covariate. An interaction analysis will be used to assess evidence that there are different treatment outcomes for those participants who test positive for HRV. A sensitivity analysis will be used to assess evidence there is an interaction between adherence and the primary outcome.\n\nThe Type I error rate for the primary analysis will be at a P-value of 0.05.\n\nAny deviation(s) from the original statistical plan will be described and justified in the protocol or final report, as appropriate.\n\nIn our recent randomised control trial of rNHF compared to Vitamin C a 5-unit reduction in MJS represented a substantial clinical benefit.\n\n[16] The upper confidence limit for the standard deviation in this trial was 6.6. A sample size of 76 in each group allows the detection of a difference of 3.5 units, with 90% power and a Type I error rate of 5%. This feasibility study had a dropout rate of zero however, even though the likelihood of dropouts in our study is low, in order to ensure that this study remains adequately powered we will allow for a 10% dropout rate in our power calculation.\n\nAllowing for a 10% dropout rate, a total of 85 participants will be randomised to each group.\n\nThere will not be an interim analysis.\n\nThis protocol has been approved by the Health and Disability Ethics Committees of New Zealand and the Regional Advisory Group -M\u0101ori (RAG-M). Locality approval has been obtained from all indicates that it is in the public interest to conduct research which investigates treatments for the common cold. Reduction in symptom severity and duration is a priority for individuals with the common cold. As such this study includes outcome measures which will investigate the effect of rhinothermy on symptom severity and duration of illness.\n\nA recent feasibility study which involved 30 participants has provided information related to effective recruitment methods, the tolerability of the device and adherence. This feasibility study has shown that the rhinothermy device is well tolerated [16], however to further consolidate these findings and assess treatment burden, this study will include outcome measures which look at adherence to and tolerability of the treatment. Participants will also be encouraged to provide feedback or raise any concerns with regards to any aspect of the study.\n\nOnce completed, the results of the study will be submitted for publication. The results will also be disseminated to those participants who indicated that they wished to receive them.\n\nParticipants will be eligible for monetary reimbursement for completing the study. A standard agreed amount has been decided upon which will cover any expenses associated with participation in the study. Participants will be eligible for reimbursement on completion of the study and this amount will be either the full agreed amount for completing the study in its entirety, or a reduced amount proportional to their involvement in the study.\n\nThe principal investigator will submit all changes to relevant parties (including the study funder) and\n\nall substantial amendments to the original approved documents will be submitted to the Health and \n\nThe Investigator will ensure that this trial is conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice.\n\nAs sponsor, Fisher and Paykel Healthcare Ltd. will monitor the study according to their own procedures and will review all serious adverse events. All adverse events and device deficiencies will be reported to the study sponsor in accordance with current local and national adverse event reporting policies. The sponsor will manage device deficiency reports as part of its ongoing postmarketing safety review process.\n\nThe sponsor will report all adverse events and relevant investigational device deficiencies to the regulatory authorities and Principal Investigator (PI) within the required time period, in accordance with current reporting requirements.\n\nA Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be appointed to review all SAEs on an expedited basis. To ensure adequate study safety, they will review enrolments, withdrawals, and AEs every six months. The DSMC may recommend to the sponsor that the study should be terminated, however the final decision will be made by the sponsor.\n\nThe PI and corresponding author will have full access to the study data and final responsibility for submitting the report for publication. The PI will also take responsibility for reporting the results to those participants who have expressed that they would like to receive the study results. Publication of the study outcomes will comprise publication of the study as a whole and is encouraged by the Participant daily symptom diary\n\nModified Jackson Symptom Score \n\n\u2022 Grace Bird wrote the current HDEC approved version of this protocol and the protocol manuscript with input from Irene Braithwaite and James Fingleton.\n\n\u2022 Richard Beasley, Irene Braithwaite, James Fingleton and Alex Semprini designed the study and directed the project.\n\n\u2022 Mark Weatherall designed and verified the randomisation schedule and statistical analysis methods.\n\n\u2022 Meik Dilcher and Lance Jennings advised on collection and laboratory analysis of nasopharyngeal specimens.\n\n\u2022 Steve McKinstry was an investigator in the rhinothermy in the common cold feasibility study and as such contributed to the development of this protocol.\n\n\u2022 James Harper and Iris Koorevaar contributed to protocol amendments.\n\nThe study is funded by Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Limited (FPH).\n\nFPH are also providing the rhinothermy and myAIRVO2\u2122 ('sham' rhinothermy) devices and associated consumables. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 You are invited to take part in a screening process to see if you are eligible for a study on the effect of inhaling warm, humidified air when you have the common cold or the 'flu. Whether or not you take part in the screening, and then the cold or flu study is your choice. If you don't want to take part, you don't have to give a reason, and it won't affect the care you receive. If you do want to take part now, but change your mind later, you can pull out at any time.\n\nThis Participant Information Sheet will help you to decide whether or not you would like to complete the screening tests for these studies. It sets out the tests that need to be done to see if you are eligible for either the cold or the flu study. We will go through this information with you and answer any questions you may have. As we need to make sure that you are enrolled into either the cold or flu study within 48 hours of developing your cold or flu symptoms, you may have only a short time to review this material before you decide whether to proceed or not. Before you decide, you may want to talk about the study with other people such as family, wh\u0101nau, friends, or healthcare providers. Feel free to do this.\n\nIf you agree to take part in the screening tests, you will be asked to sign an electronic Consent Form. You will be given a copy of both the Participant Information Sheet and the Consent Form to keep.\n\nIf, after the screening tests, you are eligible for either the cold or the flu study, and you wish to take part, you will be provided with a separate consent form.\n\nThis screening process has been approved by the Southern Health and Disability Ethics Committee.\n\nThis document is 6 pages long, including the Consent Form. Please make sure you have read and understood all the pages.\n\nThe screening process involves a number of steps; 1. We make sure you are the right age for the studies, and that you don't have any medical conditions or take any medications that might make you ineligible for either study We make sure we are comfortable that you are able to complete all the tasks in either study 3. We make sure that you are happy for your usual doctor to be advised that you are enrolled in the cold or flu study if you DO end up in one of them. 4. We ask you to fill in two questionnaires a. One about flu symptoms b. One about common cold symptoms 5. Depending on the answers to the two symptom questionnaires, you may be asked to provide us with a sample from the back of your nose, which we will take with a swab through one nostril. This sample will be tested for the presence or absence of the flu virus. 6. If you have a negative test for the flu from your nose swab, and your cold symptom score meets the entry criteria, you will be advised that you are eligible for the cold study. a. You will receive a separate informed consent form for the cold study that will outline the process specifically for that study 7. If you have a positive test for the flu from your nose swab, and your flu symptom questionnaire meets the entry criteria, you will be advised that you are eligible for the flu study. a. Please note, female participants who reach this point will be asked to undertake a urinary pregnancy test, as pregnant females will be excluded from the flu study. b. All eligible participants will receive a separate informed consent form for the flu study that will outline the process specifically for that study. 8. There may be some people who have the wrong combination of cold or flu symptoms and flu test results, and will not be suitable for either study. If you are not suitable, you will be reimbursed for your time and travel. 9. If you are enrolled in either study, we will ask that for the first five days of the study, while you are taking one of the randomised treatments, you refrain from leaving the greater Wellington region (not beyond Upper Hut or Paraparaumu). If you have existing travel plans that require you to leave the greater Wellington region, you will be advised that you are not eligible for the study.\n\nThe nostril swab we need to take is not painful, but some people may find it unpleasant or uncomfortable. They require a few seconds to perform and will be taken by trained staff.\n\nWe do not anticipate any other risks from participating in this screening process.\n\nParticipating in this screening process will not cost you anything. You will be reimbursed to alleviate the costs of travel.\n\nIf you are injured as a result of treatment given as part of this study, which is unlikely, you will not be eligible for compensation through ACC. However, compensation will be 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y available from the study sponsor, Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, in line with industry guidelines. We can give you a copy of these guidelines if you wish. You will be able to take action through the courts should you disagree with the amount of compensation offered.\n\nIf you have private health or life insurance, you may wish to check with your insurer that taking part in this study will not affect your cover.\n\nTaking part in the screening is entirely voluntary (your choice). You are free to withdraw from screening at any time, without having to give a reason. The staff overseeing the screening process may also stop you from continuing if they decide it is not in your best interests to continue.\n\nWith respect to your personal information, your screening information will be labeled with a code. The link between the code and your name and address (identifying information) will only be held by the research staff. No material which could personally identify you will be used in any reports on this study.\n\nOnce you have been through this screening process, you will be told whether you are eligible or not for either of the studies. If you are eligible for one of the studies, you will receive a separate informed consent sheet for that study.\n\nIf you change your mind during this screening process, you will not be able to participate in either the cold or flu study.\n\nData collected during this screening process will be kept in a secure location by the MRINZ for at least 10 years following study completion. If you are enrolled in either the cold or flu study, the nostril swabs we have already taken will be stored, and may be sent to a laboratory in Christchurch New Zealand for confirmatory testing. The samples will be stored until the results of each study have been published, at which point they will be destroyed.\n\nIf you are eligible to participate in either the common cold or influenza study, you may be provided with a device (which delivers the warm, humidified air) for the purposes of the study. This device is property of the Sponsor and should not be taken or used outside of the area the study is being undertaken (the greater Wellington region). To enable the location of the device to be traced, the device has a geolocation function (similar to Google location services) which will collect location data. If the device is taken outside of the study area MRINZ and the Sponsor will be notified.\n\nPeriodically, the approximate location of the device will be sent to a database on the Sponsor's secure server. The serial number of the device will also be collected. The 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y Sponsor will not have access to your personal details such as name, address or date of birth as these will only be held by MRINZ.\n\nThe location data is collected directly from the device and is stored in a database on the Sponsor's secure server.\n\nWho has access to this information? Only a limited number of authorised employees of the Sponsor will be able to access the location data. However the location data will not be actively monitored, meaning it will not be checked or used unless the device is moved outside of the greater Wellington region or reported missing by MRINZ. If the device is moved outside of the greater Wellington region the Sponsor and MRINZ will be notified and the Sponsor will provide MRINZ with the location information, MRINZ will also be provided with the information if the device is reported missing.\n\nThis information is used to ensure the location of devices can be traced. As above, unless the device is moved outside of the greater Wellington region, or MRINZ reports the device missing, the information will not be monitored or accessed. If the device is moved outside of the greater Wellington region, or the device is reported missing by MRINZ, the information will be provided to MRINZ in order to locate the device.\n\nOnce the device is returned to MRINZ the Sponsor will delete the information.\n\nIf you are not willing to consent to the collection, use and storage of this information you may not be eligible to participate in these studies.\n\nIf you have any questions, concerns or complaints about the screening process at any stage, you can contact:\n\nPhone: E-mail: If I decide to withdraw from the screening, I agree that the information collected about me up to the point when I withdraw may continue to be processed.\n\nI consent to my GP or current provider being informed about my participation in the flu or cold study should I be enrolled, and of any significant abnormal results obtained during the study.\n\nI agree to my (type of tissue) samples being sent overseas and I am aware that these samples will be disposed of using established guidelines for discarding biohazard waste.\n\nI agree to an approved auditor appointed by the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethic Committees, or any relevant regulatory authority or their approved representative reviewing my relevant medical records for the sole purpose of checking the accuracy of the information recorded for the study.\n\nI understand that my participation in this study is confidential and that no material, which could identify me personally, will be used in any reports on this study.\n\nI have read the section on geolocation of the device and consent to the collection, use and storage of this location data I understand the compensation provisions in case of injury during the study.\n\nI know who to contact if I have any questions about the study in general. In the screening tests, we found that you met the criteria for this common cold study. We are studying the effect of inhaling warm, humidified air when you have the common cold. Whether or not you take part in the study is your choice. If you don't want to take part, you don't have to give a reason, and it won't affect the care you receive. If you do want to take part now, but change your mind later, you can pull out at any time.\n\nThis Participant Information Sheet will help you to decide whether or not you would like to participate in the study. It sets out the schedule of tasks and visits needed to complete the study. We will go through this information with you and answer any questions you may have.\n\nAs we need to make sure that you are enrolled into the common cold study within 48 hours of developing your symptoms, you may have only a short time to review this material before you decide whether or not to proceed. Before you decide, you may want to talk about the study with other people such as family, wh\u0101nau, friends, or healthcare providers. Feel free to do this.\n\nThe study is carried out by Researchers from the Medical Research Institute of New Zealand (MRINZ) with support from Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, who make the rhinothermy device and are sponsors of the study. The Lead Investigator is xxxwho can be contacted on the phone number on page one if you would like to speak with her directly.\n\nIf you agree to take part in the study, you will be asked to sign an electronic Consent Form. You will be given a copy of this document and the signed Informed Consent Form to keep. \n\nThe common cold is the most frequent illness experienced by people worldwide. Many people will have experienced a cold in their lifetimesadults on average may suffer from 2-4 colds per year. Symptoms can last for up to a week and although most people get better by themselves with no treatment, it may have a significant impact on their lives. This impact includes time off of work, which in the US alone has been estimated to cost the economy $25 billion. Finding different ways of reducing the impact of the common cold, which is usually caused by a virus (there are many, the Human Rhinovirus being the most common), by inhaling steam has become a focus of research. It is thought that breathing in steam through the nose may kill the virus as well as reduce the symptoms and the number of days that people remain unwell. Some people will be familiar with steam therapy, like holding your face over a bowl of steaming hot water with a towel over your head.\n\nRhinothermy is a therapy that delivers warmed and humidified air to the nostrils and down to the lungs via nasal prongs.\n\nThe aim of the study is to show whether rhinothermy changes symptoms (length and severity) and/or reduces the number of days lost to the illness. It also aims to assess things like how often people will use rhinothermy at home and which common cold viruses people have.\n\nA picture of a person receiving rhinothermy is shown below:\n\nThis study will compare two different regimens of rhinothermy as treatment for the common cold. These two therapies deliver warmed, humidified air through the nostrils at different settings. We believe that one of these regimens/settings is likely to be more effective than the other and this study will find out if this is true.\n\nThis study runs for 14 days in total, starting with 5 days of treatment, and finishing with a further 9 days of recording your symptoms in a diary.\n\nToday is Day 1: After you sign the Informed Consent Form, we will: \uf0b7 Ask you to refrain from using any cold or flu treatments for the duration of the study (14 days), and ONLY IF absolutely necessary, take paracetamol or antiinflammatory medications (e.g. ibuprofen). \uf0b7 Ask that you refrain from leaving the greater Wellington region for the first five days of the study, while you are taking one of the two possible treatments.\n\nWe will show you how to complete your online symptom diary to: \uf0b7 Record any medications taken (cold and flu remedies or paracetamol etc.) each day for the next 13 days \uf0b7 Record each of your common cold symptoms daily for the next 13 days 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y We will randomise you to one of two possible rhinothermy treatment regimens which deliver rhinothermy at different settings. The chance of you being on either treatment is 50%, like tossing a coin. We will show you how to use your rhinothermy device here today and at home for the next 4 days. You will also receive your first (Day 1) treatment here today.\n\nOnce the treatment component is completed on Day 1, you can head home, and we will advise your GP that you have been enrolled in this study. Days 2, 3 and 4: take the randomised treatment and fill in the online diary.\n\nDay 5: this is the final day of treatment.\n\n\uf0b7 We would like you to come in after you have taken your treatment. \uf0b7 We need you to bring your rhinothermy device back to the clinic. \uf0b7 We will check on your general health. \uf0b7 We need you to fill in your online diary. \uf0b7 We will ask you to complete a tolerability questionnaire about the device. \uf0b7 The next time we will contact you will be via a phone call on Day 14.\n\nDay 6 to Day 14: Keep filling in your online diary.\n\nDay 14: This is the final day of the study. \uf0b7 We will call you to make sure that you have completed your diary, check on your general health and arrange your reimbursement for participating in the study.\n\nNostril swab: The nostril swab we need to take is not painful, but some people may find it unpleasant or uncomfortable. They require a few seconds to perform and will be taken by trained staff.\n\nThe rhinothermy devices should always be used as per the instruction manual. You will be given the appropriate user manual and training which will provide information about how to use your device. Your device will have an alarm that should sound for events such as the water level in the chamber being too low. To check that the alarm is working, we will show you how to test the alarm before you use it. If you have any concerns about using your device please do not use it and refrain from using it again until you have been able to contact the study investigator and discuss your concerns.\n\nWe have found an earlier version of the rhinothermy device to be well tolerated. A small number of participants reported a mild headache, which resolved soon after they stopped using the device. Some people find the feeling of warm, humidified air uncomfortable. There have also been a very small number of cases reported where the device's alarm function did not work but no harm was caused because of this. You are able to stop using your rhinothermy device at any stage if you are concerned.\n\nSome people get a runny nose or a blocked nose when using the device. This goes away when you stop using the device. There is also a small risk of damage to the skin around the nose and lips or getting a nosebleed while using the device. This is rare and more likely to 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y happen when the device is used for a longer period of time. The device use can be paused or stopped at any time during the study visit if any of these problems happen. The rhinothermy devices contain a plate that heats up and warms water in a chamber. Care must be taken when you are inserting or removing the chamber immediately after use as the heater plate will still be hot. The risks of using the electrically powered rhinothermy devices to humidify the air are: electric shocks, burns and tubing melt down. To avoid crosscontamination of your cold, you should make sure you do not share the device with anyone else.\n\nThe study investigator may also stop you from continuing in the study if they decide it is not in your best interests to continue. The Sponsor or the MRINZ may stop the study if there any safety concerns.\n\nAs you will have already read in the Screening Participant Information Sheet, your rhinothermy device should not be taken or used outside of the area the study is being undertaken (the greater Wellington region). To enable the location of the devices to be traced, the devices have a geolocation function (similar to Google location services) which will collect location data. For more detailed information, please refer to the Screening Participant Information Sheet.\n\nThe study is funded by Fisher and Paykel Healthcare. Participating in this study will not cost you anything. You will be paid $400 on Day 14 to cover any expenses associated with participating in this study.\n\nIf you complete only part of the study, only part of the $400 will be paid, the proportion will reflect how far you got through the study.\n\nIf you are injured as a result of treatment given as part of this study, which is unlikely, you will not be eligible for compensation through ACC. However, compensation will be available from the study sponsor, Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, in line with industry guidelines. We can give you a copy of these guidelines if you wish.
