{"title": "Systems virology: host-directed approaches to viral pathogenesis and drug targeting", "body": "Anyone who has taken an undergraduate virology course is familiar with subject matter focused on the structure of viral genomes and the molecular events associated with multistep viral life cycles. The field of virology has done a remarkable job of characterizing and categorizing viruses and defining the steps of viral attachment, entry, replication and release. Moreover, an understanding of viral protein function has paved the way for the development of antiviral drugs that target viral enzymatic activities. However, many of these drugs function poorly at best, and the virus-centric approach has not proved to be well suited for deciphering the complex and multifaceted virus\u2013host interactions that underlie viral recognition, innate immune signalling and disease outcome. In the past decade, tools have become available to chart a new course, one directed at obtaining comprehensive systems-level views of the host response and the interplay between virus and host.\n\nSystems virology is a phrase coined to describe the application of systems biology approaches to the field of virology1. Systems biology is highly interdisciplinary in character, requiring the combined talents of biologists, mathematicians and computer scientists, and the goal of the field is to gain comprehensive understanding of biological systems. In the case of systems virology, these biological systems can range from virus-infected cells to tissues to whole organisms. Systems-level analyses use high-throughput technologies to measure system-wide changes in biological components such as DNA, RNA, proteins and metabolites, and are dependent on the quality of both the resulting data sets (which are often noisy) and the subsequent data integration and modelling. Ideally, high-throughput data derived from these and other measurements are integrated and analysed using mathematical algorithms to generate predictive models of the system. When a model has been developed, subsequent experimental perturbations of the system (for example, the use of viral mutants or targeted inhibition of host genes or pathways) are used to yield refinements to the model and to increase its predictive capacity2,3,4 (Fig. 1).\n\nThis holistic, host-directed approach stands in contrast to the more traditional reductionist approaches that focus on a pre-determined small set of molecules (genes, proteins or metabolites). Although systems-level (or discovery-based) analyses are often criticized for not being hypothesis-driven, these analyses are increasingly being acknowledged as potent hypothesis generators. Moreover, for dynamic systems such as those involved in the host response to viral infection, systems-level analyses are considered the only way to understand emergent properties \u2014 that is, properties or biological outcomes that cannot be predicted by an understanding of the individual parts of a system alone, but rather become apparent only with knowledge of the specific organization of, and interactions between, components5. Because of this, systems virology is an essential and synergistic complement to traditional virology approaches.\n\nThis Review focuses on the host response to virus infection and discusses the evolution and significant findings of systems virology, including the identification of gene expression signatures that are predictive of viral pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy, insights into how viruses disrupt cellular metabolism, and the mapping of virus\u2013host interactomes. These accomplishments did not come from a single experiment or study, but rather from a body of work undertaken over several years by different investigators. The field has seen a progression from genomics-based approaches to measurements of proteins and metabolites, and has also embraced the analysis of host genetic variation as a means to better understand disease processes rather than viewing such variation as a source of frustration. Moving forwards, systems virology must also embrace computational approaches that are capable of integrating this information to construct robust virus\u2013host interaction models that incorporate multiple dimensions and scales6,7. We cite examples of studies that are moving in this direction and outline what the next phase of systems virology must encompass to reach its full potential.\n\nAs more and more high-throughput data become available, systems virology is poised to enter a new phase to fulfil its initial promise of revolutionizing our understanding of virus\u2013host interactions. To do this, the field must move beyond just the listing of molecules that are differentially expressed on viral infection. Instead, the relationships between key molecules must be defined. Such relationships may be cause-and-effect relationships (for example, transcription factors and their target genes), the result of co-expression, or due to genetic or direct physical interactions. Here, we give examples of several methods that are being used to further our understanding of virus\u2013host interaction networks, and we then discuss key computational challenges that must be addressed.\n\nNetwork modelling and analysis explores the relationships among molecules and the structure and organization of these relationships to predict the behaviour of the network or system. For example, the context likelihood of relatedness (CLR) method is used to predict genes that are highly interconnected (referred to as hubs) or that exhibit a high degree of betweenness centrality (referred to as bottlenecks). Genes with high betweenness centrality exhibit fewer connections than hub genes, but because they are located between (and connect or bridge) multiple subnetworks, they can have a powerful role in controlling network signalling (Fig. 3). Bottleneck genes often function as key genes in the regulation of disease progression and are therefore attractive targets for further experimentation66,67. An alternative method, co-regulation network analysis (PCluster)68, has been combined with genome-wide expression profiling and yeast two-hybrid analysis to identify relationships between gene expression and direct physical interactions, revealing previously unrecognized roles for several cellular and viral proteins in the host response to H1N1 influenza virus69. These proteins include a network of RNA-binding proteins, components of the WNT signalling pathway and viral polymerase subunits. However, as these types of analyses often only infer correlations between network components, additional studies are required to verify model predictions.\n\nThese network analysis methods have also been used to analyse the network topology of networks derived from proteomic and lipidomic profiling data. For example, such an analysis identified two mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation enzymes, DCI (also known as ECI1) and HADHB, as bottleneck proteins and possible targets through which HCV disrupts cellular metabolic homeostasis70. The importance of DCI (and of cellular metabolic homeostasis in general) during HCV infection was then confirmed by additional means, which included pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid oxidation and targeted siRNA knockdown techniques, both of which demonstrated that DCI is required for productive HCV infection in hepatoma cell lines71,72. Similarly, an analysis of the interaction networks between host proteins and HCV core and NS4B proteins has been used to identify host proteins that constitute potential anti-HCV therapeutic targets, including \u03b1-enolase, paxillin and a solute carrier protein (SLC25A5)73. A better understanding of network topology will not only provide the opportunity to identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention, but also offer insights into possible off-target effects on network signalling that might be induced by drug treatment.\n\nAlthough much can be learned from the construction and topological analysis of host\u2013pathogen interaction networks using samples from whole tissues, the heterogeneity of cell types present in most tissues means that such networks provide a generalized picture of the changes that occur in the host during the course of infection. For example, it is difficult to delineate from these types of networks the signalling events that might occur between infected lung epithelial cells and cells of the immune system, both inside and outside the infected tissue. These intercellular interactions are also controlled by signal transduction pathways, which communicate signals from the extracellular environment to intracellular effector processes. To fully interpret the data, we need a much better understanding of intercellular signalling processes, the cells that are involved and the directionality of their effects on infection outcome.\n\nA few studies have begun to explore cell type-specific and intercellular signalling on a system-wide scale. For example, flow cytometry and gene expression data from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from young adult and aged macaques infected with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus were analysed in conjunction with data from the Immune Response In Silico (IRIS) database. This database contains cell type-specific gene expression patterns associated with various types of immune cells. By computationally comparing differentially expressed genes in BAL with cell type-specific gene expression patterns in the IRIS database, it was possible to identify genes associated with specific immune cell types, including activated dendritic cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and naive B cells. In particular, genes associated with B cell and T cell markers were more highly upregulated in young adult animals74.\n\nRecent studies of mouse models of intestinal inflammation induced by TNF treatment provide another good example of how systems approaches can be used to evaluate signalling between cell types in a complex tissue environment75,76. In these studies, the authors combined flow cytometry measurements and phosphoprotein, cytokine and chemokine expression data from various immune cell types over time and under diverse conditions and were thus able to construct statistically robust multivariate regression models that related the phosphoprotein signals, cytokines, chemokines and cell types to specific phenotypes. These models helped to elucidate key molecular and cellular processes governing epithelial cell apoptosis and proliferation in response to TNF treatment. For example, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP1; also known as CCL2) was predicted by the model to be especially protective against TNF-induced apoptosis, and this hypothesis was confirmed by treating with an MCP1-specific antibody before TNF administration. The model also indicated that plasmacytoid dendritic cells might be particularly important for inducing apoptosis, and depleting these cells from mice under conditions that normally produced the most severe epithelial cell apoptosis did indeed revert the TNF-induced phenotype to the mildest outcome.\n\nIn addition to constructing network models that span intra- and intercellular signalling processes, it will be necessary to consider nonlinear relationships such as how the network functions over time (that is, the dynamics of the system). This is particularly true in light of evidence (discussed above) that the magnitude and timing of the host response to respiratory viruses are crucial determinants of the eventual disease outcome. Similar evidence is accumulating that the outcome of HIV infection is also related to the activation dynamics of host gene regulation77,78. However, high-throughput data are typically static and often not adequate for modelling dynamic systems. To help overcome this limitation in analysing network dynamics, inference methodologies are being devised to reinterpret activity differences caused by system perturbations as differences in observation time. For example, changes in pathogen-induced gene expression that are associated with genetic variability, whether in the pathogen (for example, mutant viruses) or the host (as occurs in the Collaborative Cross mouse model), can potentially be used to indirectly infer the crucial dynamics of a system without having to measure the system over time. This innovative approach has only recently become feasible with major breakthroughs in the theory of dynamic systems and in geometrical high-dimensional analysis methodology79,80.\n\nAs virology continues to transition into a more quantitative science, increasing attention must be paid not only to network dynamics but also to other nonlinear interactions, such as cooperative or synergistic relationships, which characterize so much of biology. Current biomarker discovery and the identification of molecular predictors of adjuvant, vaccine or, more generally, drug efficacy are largely unsuccessful because nonlinear interactions between molecules, as well as genetic diversity in populations, are not taken into sufficient consideration. Geometrical methods (that is, methods used to identify the structure in data by identifying spatial and temporal relationships) are increasingly being used in the analysis of high-throughput molecular data. In particular, novel combinations of geometrical methods, such as those based on singular value decomposition (SVD) and multidimensional scaling (MDS)81,82, are beginning to be used in systems virology to better understand the nonlinear interactions between variables and isolate those interactions from biological noise.\n\nLiver biopsies were carried out on patients who were infected with HCV and had received liver transplants, and SVD\u2013MDS analysis of transcriptomic data from these biopsy samples, in combination with categorical analysis (to take into account variables such as age, time post-transplantation and fibrosis score), has been used to identify a molecular signature for patients at risk of developing severe fibrosis83. SVD\u2013MDS and co-abundance networks (which relate molecules to each other on the basis of their abundance profiles) were also used to integrate proteomic and metabolomic data sets obtained from the same cohort of patients. This strategy identified a potential role for oxidative stress in rapid fibrosis progression after the transplant surgery and identified serum metabolites that might prove useful as biomarkers for predicting progression to fibrosis84. This understanding of network structure can now be used to simulate human liver metabolism using novel flux balance modelling approaches to better comprehend and eventually treat disease85. Additional geometrical approaches have been described and should prove useful for effectively bridging different technologies86,87 and for integrating diverse types of data, thereby enabling better analysis of the data that are already available in public databases and repositories. Finally, geometrical methods, as well as links between geometry, information theory and probability theory7, will also help to identify causal relationships88, which is clearly a currently unmet challenge. Unlike purely statistical approaches, geometrical methods can be used to integrate different individual measures for the purposes of comparison and combination into coherent objects that identify relationships between genes, transcripts or proteins."}
