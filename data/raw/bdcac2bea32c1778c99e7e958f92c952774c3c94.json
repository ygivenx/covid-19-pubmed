Consolidative whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) has been utilized, but given the low survival benefit and high risk of neurotoxicity with this approach, 3, 4 there have been efforts to identify alternative options. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation (HDC/ASCT) has been investigated as post-remission consolidation or in relapsed disease with promising results. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] HD-MTX-based induction regimens followed by ASCT with various conditioning regimens, including BEAM (carmustine/etoposide/cytarabine/melphalan), 5,6,10 thiotepa/busulfan, 11, 12 TBC (thiotepa/busulfan/cyclophosphamide), 8, 9, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] and thiotepa/carmustine [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] have been evaluated.\n\nData thus far, however, are limited to single-arm phase 2 trials and several important questions remain including the best candidates for such therapy, the timing of its use, the possible toxicities, and the optimal conditioning regimen. We report our findings of a single institution, retrospective analysis among consecutive patients with PCNSL, secondary CNS lymphoma (SCNSL), and relapsed CNS lymphoma having undergone consolidative ASCT with TBC conditioning based on early experiences using this regimen. 19, 20 \n\nPatients: 8 Between July 2006 and December 2017, all patients with NHL having undergone ASCT with TBC conditioning regimen at the University of California, Los Angeles were retrospectively reviewed. Three groups of patients were included: PCNSL defined as lymphoma confined to the CNS including intraocular lymphoma; SCNSL defined as lymphoma with systemic disease and CNS involvement; or CNS relapse defined as initial diagnosis of systemic lymphoma followed by relapse in the CNS with or without systemic involvement at the time of relapse. The SCNSL and CNS relapse patients were grouped together as patients with systemic lymphoma with CNS involvement, whether that be at initial diagnosis or upon relapse. The primary analysis included patients who underwent ASCT in first complete remission (CR1). Patients with SCNSL or with CNS involvement at relapse of disease were analyzed separately.\n\nFor patients with PCNSL, a uniform induction therapy was given which consisted of rituximab 375 mg/m 2 and high dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) 8 g/m 2 followed by rituximab 375 mg/m 2 , cytarabine 2 X 3 g/m 2 and thiotepa 40 mg/m 2 based on published data. 27 The number of cycles of rituximab/HD-MTX and rituximab/cytarabine/thiotepa was based on the physicians' choice.\n\nDosages were adjusted based on the physicians' discretion for organ toxicity, tolerance, or functional status.\n\nFor patients with secondary CNS lymphoma or relapsed disease, a variety of chemotherapy regimens at the clinician's discretion were used with a goal of achieving complete remission prior to ASCT (Table 2) .\n\nRemission status was assessed with MRI brain and/or PET brain prior to transplant, and ultimately interpreted by the treating physician.\n\nHigh-dose chemotherapy prior to ASCT consisted of thiotepa 250 mg/m 2 daily for 3 doses (days -9 to -7), busulfan 0.8 mg/kg every 6 hours for 12 doses (days -6 to -4), and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg daily for 2 doses (days -3 and -2) with mesna, as previously described by Soussain et al. 9 Phenytoin 300 mg daily was given for seizure prophylaxis on days -7 to -2. Peripheral blood stem cells were mobilized and collected per institution protocol.\n\nToxicity was assessed via chart review. Neutrophil and platelet recovery were assessed according to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) (https://www.cibmtr.org/DataManagement/TrainingReference/Manuals/DataManagement/Docu ments/post-ted-instruction.pdf). Neutrophil engraftment was defined as the first of 3 consecutive days with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 500 cells per mm 2 . Platelet recovery was defined as the first of 3 consecutive days with a platelet count \u2265 20,000 per mm 2 and seven days after the last platelet transfusion. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) was defined as death for any reason other than disease relapse within 100 days from transplant.\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier method was used to plot survival curves. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined from the date of transplant to the date of relapse, progression, or any cause of death.\n\nOverall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of transplant to death from any cause. The date of disease progression was assigned using the date of imaging or biopsy if available to confirm disease progression.\n\nData were summarized as mean with standard deviation, median with interquartile range, or number-in-group with percent of group based on the distribution of the data. Univariate comparisons between diagnoses were made using Fisher's exact test for discrete data and Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for continuous data. OS and PFS were modelled using the Cox proportional hazards model and summarized using hazards-ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Time-to-event data were further summarized using Kaplan-Meier curves. All hypotheses were two-sided and a p-value was considered statistically significant if it was below 0.05. Analysis was completed in the R Statistical Computing Environment (R Core Tea; Vienna, Austria).\n\nBetween \n\nChemotherapy regimens for all patients prior to ASCT are shown in Table 2 .\n\nOf the 21 PCNSL patients who underwent ASCT while in CR1, all received induction therapy with rituximab/HD-MTX for a varying number of cycles by physician's choice (median 4, range 2-13) followed by rituximab/cytarabine/thiotepa (median 2, range 1-2). One PCNSL patient did not receive thiotepa with rituximab/cytarabine for unclear reasons. The other six patients who had relapsed or refractory disease before ASCT received additional therapies including temozolomide (3 patients) and topotecan (1 patient) in addition to extra cycles of rituximab/HD-MTX and rituximab/cytarabine/thiotepa. The SCNSL/CNS relapse patients received a variety of therapies prior to transplant including R-CHOP (6 patients, 28.6%), R-EPOCH (9 patients, 42.9%), and R-DHAP (6 patients, 28.6%), in addition to other regimens including R-DHAOx, HyperCVAD, CHOEP, temozolomide, and belinostat. HD-MTX (14 patients, 66.7%) and HD-cytarabine (4 patients, 19 .0%) were also given, and intrathecal chemotherapy with IT-MTX and/or IT-cytarabine were administered to 7 patients. 12 The median number of cycles of HD-MTX for all patients was 4 (range 0-14), and the median number of cycles of cytarabine/thiotepa for all patients was 1 (range 0-3). Three patients received WBRT before transplant: 2 PCNSL who did not go into remission after induction chemotherapy and 1 CNS relapse.\n\nKaplan-Meier curves for progression-free survival and overall survival are displayed in Figure 1 . \n\nTransplant-related toxicities with the TBC conditioning regimen are shown in Table 5 .\n\nThe median time to neutrophil recovery and platelet recovery were 9.5 days (IQR 9.0-10.0) and 15 No evidence of pulmonary toxicity or veno-occlusive disease was noted.\n\nDespite data that support the use of HDC/ASCT in patients with NHL involving the CNS as both post-remission consolidation 5, 6, 8, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] and in the relapsed/refractory setting, 8, 9, 19, 20, [28] [29] [30] [31] several unanswered questions remain in regards to ideal patient candidates, optimal conditioning, and timing of transplant. Furthermore, the efficacy and toxicity compared to WBRT or non-myeloablative chemotherapy is still incompletely characterized. 32 Our study evaluating HDC/ASCT in both the post-remission and relapsed/refractory settings using a uniform TBC preparative regimen, based on prior published data by Soussain et al, 9, 19, 20 aims to provide insight for identifying patients that may benefit most from this therapy. 15 Our data adds to this experience 15 in showing comparable disease control and survival rates to these studies with a 2-year PFS rate of 80.5% (95% CI 69.9-92.9) and a 2-year OS rate of 80.1% (95% CI 69.2-92.7).\n\nIn the subset of patients with PCNSL transplanted in CR1, data may be even more favorable, with our institution reporting a 2-year PFS and OS rate of 95.2% (95% CI 86.6-100). These results mimic data obtained in DeFillip et al which noted a PFS and OS of 92% and 95% at 2 years for PCNSL patients transplanted in CR1. 17 40, 41 However, both of these studies included patients with active CNS disease which is known to have poorer outcomes than those with CNS lymphoma in remission. 39, 42 Indeed, all patients with SCNSL/CNS relapse in our study and in both Chen and Qualls et al were transplanted while in CR, which is likely contributing to the favorable survival outcomes. 15, 37 One concern with the TBC regimen is non-hematologic toxicity. The most common therapyrelated toxicities noted in most studies using this regimen are febrile neutropenia, mucositis, and diarrhea. 14, 15, 18 Our study also noted a high rate of nausea/vomiting and electrolyte abnormalities. The incidence of septic complications with TBC conditioning appears to be higher than with other conditioning regimens and has also led to higher rates of treatment-related mortality. We report a TRM rate of 8.3% (all from septic complications) and other institutions have reported a range of 0-14.3% with TBC conditioning in PCNSL patients. 8, 15, 18, 43 The reason for this increased toxicity is not clear. While some studies have found age > 60 years to be a factor, 8 others found no association. 18 Scordo et al hypothesized that the high TRM rate may be secondary to busulfan if levels are above therapeutic range, but then found that patients with elevated first-dose busulfan area under the curve values did not experience more toxicity. 18 Given that CNS penetration of cyclophosphamide is much lower (<30%) than what can be achieved with thiotepa and busulfan, 33 year EFS was 45% 11 and a long-term follow-up study showed an overall survival of 35%. 12 They noted a higher relapse rate (4 patients, 25%) than other studies with TBC conditioning 14, 15 and also a high TRM (2 patients, 12.5%). 11 Neurotoxicity occurred in 88.9% of patients who received WBRT, although no cases were reported among patients who underwent ASCT without previous WBRT. Therefore, the data thus far shows no superior outcomes with the removal of cyclophosphamide from TBC conditioning. However, given that only one study has examined thiotepa and busulfan alone and its small sample size of only 16 patients, the true benefit of cyclophosphamide remains undetermined.\n\nAn alternative option for a CNS-directed conditioning regimen is the combination of carmustine and thiotepa. Carmustine is another agent with substantial CNS penetration (15-70%), though not as high as busulfan. 33 Two studies by Illerhaus et al evaluated this conditioning regimen with favorable results. One study reported a PFS and OS rate of 83% at 5 years 21, 22 and the second study reported a projected PFS of 73% and OS of 82% at 5 years. 7, 24 Both studies reported no TRM making this regimen another promising treatment option. As discussed in further detail below, this conditioning regimen was also evaluated in the randomized study IELSG32 which reported a 2-year OS of 77% and a TRM of 3%. 44 A meta-analysis of HDC/ASCT for PCNSL found carmustine/thiotepa to be the conditioning regimen with the lowest risk of TRM, but the TBC regimen to have numerically superior PFS and OS rates. 45 Neurotoxicity appears to be less common with HDC/ASCT than with WBRT consolidation. We report a rate of 27.1% for reversible neurotoxicity, most commonly consisting of delirium and rarely seizure (4.2%). Scordo et al reported a similar finding of neurotoxicity in 10% of patients (including delirium, seizure, anxiety/depression, neuropathy, syncope, headache, and mania) who underwent HDC/ASCT. 18 Long-term neurotoxic effects were not evaluated in our study but other reports have documented some delayed effects. 15, 17 However, the rates of long-term neurotoxic effects appear to be lower than that with WBRT, which has been reported as 24% 5- year cumulative incidence of neurotoxicity. 3, 4, 46, 47 Our study has several limitations, including the limited sample size and retrospective nature of the study. Although we do not have precise data on the number of patients that did not receive HDC/ASCT, the vast majority of patients with these diagnoses in whom we initiated therapy did ultimately undergo transplant. In our experience it was rare for patients with these diagnoses to not be candidates for stem cell transplant after receiving induction or salvage therapy once they achieved best response. Additionally, while PCNSL patients transplanted in CR1 received a uniform induction regimen, the patients with refractory or relapsed PCNSL and SCNSL/CNS received heterogeneous induction and salvage therapies ( Table 2 ) making definitive conclusions on the efficacy of HDC/ASCT in this cohort of patients difficult. Finally, toxicity evaluation was not recorded according to CTCAE or objective scoring systems and were arbitrarily defined using chart review. The long-term neurotoxic effects and minimal residual disease status were also not evaluated.\n\nSeveral randomized clinical trials are investigating the role of HDC/ASCT consolidation therapy compared with WBRT 48,49 and nonmyeloablative chemotherapy. 32, 50 In the PRECIS trial, which included only patients < 60 years of age, patients randomized to HDC/ASCT with TBC conditioning after induction chemotherapy (n = 70) had a 2-year PFS of 87% (95% CI 77-98) versus 63% (95% CI 49-81) in those receiving WBRT (n = 70). However, OS after 4 years was similar in both arms (66% versus 64%). TRM was higher in the HDC/ASCT group (5 deaths versus 1 death in WBRT group). Cognitive impairment was documented after WBRT, but cognitive functions improved or remained stable after HDC/ASCT. 49 The IELSG32 trial compared WBRT (n = 55 patients) versus ASCT (n = 58 patients) with carmustine/thiotepa conditioning for consolidation and showed similar 2-year PFS (76% after WBRT versus 75% 19 after ASCT, p = 0.62). and 2-year OS (82% after WBRT versus 77% after ASCT, p = 0.91). 44 TRM was 3% in the ASCT group and there was a non-significant trend towards impaired attention and executive functions 2 years after therapy of those given WBRT. 44 For nonmyeloablative chemotherapy, two trials are in process. The CALBG 51101 trial will compare dose-intensive etoposide and cytarabine chemotherapy with HDC/ASCT using carmustine and thiotepa conditioning, 32,50 and the European MATRIX/IELSG43 will compare consolidation chemotherapy consisting of rituximab, dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin (R-DeVIC) with HDC/ASCT using thiotepa and carmustine conditioning. 32 There is also data on the use of novel agents targeting components of the B-cell receptor pathway, namely the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib, and immunomodulatory drugs such as lenalidomide and pomalidomide. 51 These agents have promising high response rates but currently have only been trialed in the salvage setting. 52\n\nOverall, these results support the use of HDC/ASCT with CNS-directed conditioning as consolidative therapy for PCNSL with long-term efficacy and manageable side effects. PCNSL patients transplanted in CR1 appear to have a survival benefit compared to those patients transplanted beyond CR1. Data for SCNSL and in the relapse setting also appears encouraging. Longer follow-up and comparison with other consolidative therapies will provide further insight and should be reported in the near future. WBRT: whole brain radiation therapy "}
