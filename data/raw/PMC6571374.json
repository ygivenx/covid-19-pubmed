{"title": "Asthma associated with denatonium benzoate in a healthcare worker in Taiwan", "body": "Denatonium benzoate is a useful indicator to ensure that the respirator being used by an individual forms a tight enough seal to adequately protect against unwanted airborne exposure.[1] During the coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Taiwan in 2003,[2] a significant number of the infected subjects were healthcare workers (HCWs) who contracted the SARS infection from their patients. For the prevention of airborne infections, many HCWs in hospitals have been fit tested for respirator use as a part of respiratory protection programs since 2003.[2,3] The main purpose of fit testing is to ensure that the respirator being used by the individual forms a tight enough seal to adequately protect the person from unwanted airborne hazard exposures. Although the relative risk for adverse effects of fit testing using denatonium benzoate is low, the absolute number of workers with adverse reactions may nevertheless be sizeable.[3] Under these circumstances, the health consequences for individuals given denatonium benzoate become an important issue. We report a case that required hospitalization for a severe asthmatic reaction related to denatonium benzoate fit testing.\n\nBeing a case report, our institution does not require formal ethical approval. Informed written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying image.\n\nIn this case, asthma related to denatonium benzoate was diagnosed for several reasons: the patient exhibited typical symptoms of asthma without any other apparent cause, the spectrum of symptoms was consistent with previous clinical descriptions of asthma and rapid onset of asthmatic symptoms after exposure of denatonium benzoate aerosol,[7] the results of serial pulmonary function tests showed obstructive lung function, and a higher concentration of immunoglobulin antibody E (IgE) (516.3 IU/mL) was noted (Table 1).\n\nTaste is one of the senses through which humans and other animals perceive their environment.[6] The taste function is multidimensional. Qualitatively, the primary taste is bitter, a sensation that comes from specific chemicals that are detected by specialized receptors in the tongue, as well as other parts of the oral cavity. However, when most people refer to taste, they actually imply flavor.[6,8] Flavors can be considered the perceptual integration of signals from the gustatory, olfactory, and trigeminal systems.[8]\n\nDenatonium benzoate is a quaternary ammonium compound that has been used as a denaturant since 1960.[9,10] Denatonium benzoate is a very bitter substance and is detected by taste at a dilution of 1 part per 20 million parts water.[9,10] The expression of the bitter taste receptor (TAS2Rs) on human airway smooth muscle (ASM) is considered an avoidance receptor for inhalants that, when activated, leads to ASM contraction and bronchospasm.[11]\n\nAdverse reactions related to denatonium benzoate are rare. A previous report[10] revealed a case with a severe allergic reaction, including urticaria and asthma, resulting from exposure to denatonium benzoate. Another study[3] in Canada presented several cases related to the use of denatonium benzoate for respirator fit testing. Among them, the reactions of several cases were likely due to an irritant effect; others were more consistent with angioedema and asthmatic episodes; and some of the adverse effects may have been more psychologic than toxicologic in nature. Individual susceptibility to denatonium benzoate may play a role in adverse reactions.[3,11]\n\nPrevious studies have shown an association between disinfectants and asthma.[11\u201315] The disinfectants, quaternary ammonium compounds (such as benzalkonium chloride), amine compounds, and fragrances are the main sensitizers presented in cleaning products. Bleach (sodium hypochlorite), hydrochloric acid, and alkaline agents (ammonia and sodium hydroxide), which are commonly mixed together, are considered the strongest airway irritants in cleaning products.[11,12,13,15] Exposure to the ingredients of cleaning products may give rise to both new-onset asthma, with or without a latency period, and work-exacerbated asthma.[12,13] Although it has been indicated that in many workers, respiratory tract symptoms induced by chemicals and fragrances cannot be explained by allergic or asthmatic reactions, these patients may have hyperactivity to inhaled irritants, which is known to reflect sensory reactivity.[12\u201314]\n\nOur case had a higher level of IgE (516.3 IU/mL). It is likely a reflection of atopic features that already result from a known history of allergy to disinfectants. Similar to previous studies,[11\u201315] the clinical presentations of this case may be due to an asthma exacerbation through exposure to irritants or sensitization to denatonium benzoate.\n\nThe limitation of this study was that there was no specific patch testing, specific inhalation challenge, and specific IgE measurements with the ingredient of denatonium benzoate because the survival of this patient was the priority. However, the temporal relationship between the patient with asthmatic symptoms and exposure to denatonium benzoate is quite clear. It might be deduced that the patient's symptoms of difficulty breathing began when she was exposed to denatonium benzoate.\n\nIn summary, this case indicates that there may be potentially significant health risks associated with denatonium benzoate-based fit testing, at least for a specific group of susceptible individuals. Individuals who have a history of allergy to disinfecting products (containing quaternary ammonium) should avoid exposure of denatonium benzoate. More advanced research is required in the future.\n\nThe authors thank the staff members (Department of Chest, Tainan Municipal Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan) for their help in collecting the data.\n\nConceptualization: Kou-Huang Chen, Kuo-Mou Chung, Kow-Tong Chen.\n\nData curation: Ju-Hui Chung.\n\nFormal analysis: Kow-Tong Chen.\n\nInvestigation: Kuo-Mou Chung, Kow-Tong Chen.\n\nMethodology: Kou-Huang Chen, Kow-Tong Chen.\n\nResource: Kuo-Mou Chung, Ju-Hui Chung.\n\nSupervision: Kou-Huang Chen.\n\nWriting \u2013 original draft: Kou-Huang Chen, Kow-Tong Chen.\n\nWriting \u2013 review & editing: Kuo-Mou Chung, Kow-Tong Chen.\n\nAll the authors read and approved the final version of the manuscript."}
