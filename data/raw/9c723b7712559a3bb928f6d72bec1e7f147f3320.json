{"title": "An experimental infection model for reproduction of calf pneumonia with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) based on one combined exposure of calves", "body": "Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) was first reported in 1970 in Switzerland (Paccaud and Jacquier, 1970) and has subsequently been identified worldwide as an important pathogen in acute respiratory disease in calves (Baker and Velicer, 1991; Bryson et al., 1978; Larsen, 2000; Uttenthal et al., 1996; .\n\nEarly attempts to experimentally reproduce pneumonia with BRSV had limited success, and the role of BRSV in calf pneumonia could therefore not be verified (Belknap et al., 1995) . Thus, Smith et al. (1975) and Castleman et al. (1985) obtained mild clinical disease but very little postmortem evidence of pneumonia following single inoculations of conventionally reared calves, while others only obtained postmortem evidence of BRSV-pneumonia with little or no clinical disease in gnotobiotic calves (Gaddum et al., 1996; Thomas et al., 1984) . When inoculating intratracheally and intranasally for four consecutive days, some authors (Ciszewski et al., 1991; Bryson et al., 1983) reproduced moderate to severe signs of respiratory disease as well as consolidated lung tissue, while others only achieved mild signs of BRSV-infection (Kimman et al., 1987; Otto et al., 1996) . Thus, even when using this rather heavy inoculation regimen, reproducibility of the disease has been inconsistent. However, disease has recently been reproduced in 2-6-month-old calves by single aerosol inoculations with North-American field isolates of BRSV (West et al., 1999; Woolums et al., 1999) . Research in Veterinary Science 74 (2003) 55-65 www.elsevier.com/locate/rvsc In this study we describe a reliable experimental infection model for BRSV in 2-5-month-old conventionally reared Jersey calves using a European field isolate of BRSV. The results presented in the present paper have been accumulated over several years and support the papers published by West et al. (1999) and Woolums et al. (1999) .\n\nFive colostrum-deprived (<6 h old) and 41 colostrum-fed (4-14 days old) Jersey bull calves were obtained from two closed dairy herds and transferred to isolation units at Lindholm. Colostrum-deprived calves were fed 175 ml serum from BRSV-antibody-free cattle in an electrolyte solution for 3 days and treated with amoxicillin (Synulox, Pfizer) on day 2 and 3 after birth. From day 4, all calves were fed milk replacer (''Sundkalv, Type 1,'' DLG, Denmark) and reared according to normal management procedures for dairy calves.\n\nThe calves were tested weekly for BRSV-specific IgM and IgG1 antibodies (Uttenthal et al., 2000) to rule out natural BRSV-infection during rearing. They were 7-22 weeks old at inoculation (median value 14 weeks, interquartil range 11-16 weeks), and were free from persistent infection with bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV) .\n\nEight experiments were conducted during 24 months (Table 1) , one in colostrum-deprived (exp. III) and seven in colostrum-fed (exp. IV, Va, Vb, VI, VIII, IX, and XI) calves. All calves were inoculated on day 0 PI in each individual experiment. A total of 37 calves were inoculated with BRSV and killed on day 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 15, or 30 post-inoculation (PI), while nine mock-inoculated control calves were killed on day 2, 4, 6, 8, or 15 PI (Table 1) .\n\nThe four calves in exp. XI were treated with 2.5 mg enrofloxacin per kg (Baytril, Bayer) from the day before infection until euthanasia on day 6 PI.\n\nA 1-month-old, colostrum-deprived calf (calf #2031) was killed on day 6 after inoculation with lung lavage fluid from a naturally BRSV-infected calf with severe pneumonia (Viuff et al., 1996, calf #3) . The left lung of calf #2031 was lavaged with 100 ml of Eagles\u00d5 minimal essential medium (Glasgow modification) without antibiotics (MEM)), and this lung lavage fluid inoculum (BRSV BRSVLLF) was snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen in aliquots of 4 ml and kept at )80\u00b0C. Filtered (0.2 lm) extract of lung tissue from calf #2031was cultured in low passage, semi-primary foetal bovine lung cells (FBL) grown in MEM) with 5% foetal bovine serum, and harvested with sterile glass beads between passages. First, third and fourth cell culture passages (BRSV BRSV CCP1, 3a, 3b, and 4) were frozen at )80\u00b0C in aliquots of 4 ml and used as inoculum (Table 1) .\n\nControl inocula consisted of lung lavage fluid from healthy, young calves (CTR CTR LLFa and b) or uninfected FBL cells (CTR CTR CCP1).\n\nCo-infection of inocula with bacteria and mycoplasmas was excluded by conventional isolation methods. The inocula were cultured on monolayers of calf kidney cells (CK), which were examined for cytopathogenic effect (CPE), and screened for infection with bovine entero virus (BEV), bovine herpes virus 1 (BoHV-1), parainfluenza 3 virus (PI-3V), bovine adeno virus (BAV), mammalian REO viruses (REO), and BVDV by indirect immunofluorescence test (IFT) using pooled virus-specific hyperimmune rabbit-and swine-sera and anti-species conjugates (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The presence of bovine corona virus (BCV) was investigated by ELISA .\n\nThe calves were inoculated once by a combination of 10 min aerosol exposure, mostly containing droplets less than 3 lm (Waechtomat inhalator VM 82, Kruuse, Denmark), followed by one intratracheal injection. The aerosol inoculum was diluted to a total of 5 ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and administered through a mask covering nostrils and mouth. The intratracheal inoculum was diluted to 20 ml in PBS and injected into trachea during provoked heavy inhalation. A dose of 10 4:6 -10 5:2 TCID 50 of BRSV was administered each way to each of the 37 BRSV-infected calves, while the nine control calves received BRSV-negative inoculum. Any possible loss of infectivity during aerosol creation was not measured.\n\nGroups of control calves and BRSV-infected calves were kept in separated isolation rooms after inoculation, hence, clinical assessment could not be double blind. Respiratory rates, rectal temperatures, and other clinical signs were recorded, and serum samples and nasal swabs collected, daily from the day of inoculation (day 0 PI) until slaughter. Sampling was reduced to nasal swabs and serum samples three times weekly after day 15 PI. Nasal swabs were collected in 0.8 ml MEM including 1 million IU penicillin and 1 g streptomycin per liter (MEM+).\n\nThe calves were anaesthetised with 30% pentobarbital (1 ml per 6 kg bodyweight) and bled out through Aa. and Vv. axillaris and iliaca externa. The lungs were immediately removed and photographs taken, from which the extent of macroscopic lesions was rated with a score between 0 and 5 according to Fig. 1 . The gross appearance of the pathological changes of the lung tissue, and the amount and nature of the exudate, were evaluated during the postmortem procedure for the two lungs.\n\nThe left lung was lavaged as described above, and lung tissue samples (2 g) were recovered from nine predetermined sites representing the dorsal, medial, and ventral part of the three lobes, for detection of BRSV antigen by ELISA. Lung lavage fluid and lung tissue from the right lung, preferably from consolidated areas, were examined for BRSV by isolation on FBL cell culture. Growth of BRSV was demonstrated by IFT using guinea pig anti-BRSV serum and anti-guinea pig conjugate (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark).\n\nTissue samples from eight predetermined sites in the right lung, trachea, nasal epithelium, ln. tracheobronchalis, tonsil, and spleen were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. The tissue samples were examined by conventional histological techniques, and the presence of BRSV-antigen was investigated by im-munohistochemistry as previously described .\n\nNasal swabs were pre-treated with 5% Triton X-100 (Serva) for 30 min, while lung tissue samples were triturated (Stomacher) in equal amounts of ELISA buffer (0.015 M Na 2 HPO 4 , 0.005 M KH 2 PO 4 , 0.5 M NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.8) and centrifuged at 1600 G for 10 min. One standardised positive control was included for every nine samples.\n\nMicroplates with 96 wells (Maxisorp U96 immunoplate, Nunc, Denmark) were coated with rabbit anti-BRSV hyperimmune serum (1:800) in carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Between each step, all wells were rinsed three times in ELISA buffer and left for five minutes with a fourth rinse.\n\nThe steps were duplicate twofold dilution series (100 ll) of the samples (undiluted-1:128), followed first by normal or anti-BRSV guinea pig serum in alternating columns, then by peroxidase-conjugated rabbit antiguinea pig immunoglobulins (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), and finally by OPD substrate. The titrated Fig. 1 . Basis for scoring of extent of lung damage. Score 0 is given to a lung without pathological lesions. (A) Score 1 (1-5%); (B) score 2 (5-15%); (C) score 3 (15-30%); (D) score 4 (30-50%); (E) score 5 (>50%), dorsal aspect; (F) score 5 (>50%), ventral aspect. samples were left overnight at 5\u00b0C, while the guinea pig sera (1/200 with 5% normal rabbit serum) and conjugate (1:700) were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. The substrate reaction was stopped after 10 min at room temperature by adding 1.0 M H 2 SO 4 , and the plates were read at OD 492 nm.\n\nThe titre of a sample was expressed as the highest positive dilution. Dilutions were considered positive if the OD value of the well added anti-BRSV guinea pig serum was >0.100, and the ratio between the OD values of this well and the corresponding negative well added normal guinea pig serum (P/N ratio) was 3 or above.\n\nSera from the day of inoculation and the day of slaughter were tested for antibodies against PI-3, BAV, and BCV by ELISA , as well as for neutralising antibodies against a Danish BRSV field strain. The neutralising BRSV titre was based on neutralisation peroxidase labelling assay (NPLA), and calculated as a 50% endpoint titre (NPLA 50 ).\n\nSupernatant of triturated lung tissue was inoculated into CK monolayers, which were examined for CPE during two cell culture passages, followed by IFT for specific viruses as described for inocula. In addition, tissue from the right lung was tested for the presence of PI-3, BAV, and BCV antigen by ELISA . Moreover, lung-, spleen-, and liver-samples were investigated for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and bronchial swabs for mycoplasmas, by conventional isolation methods.\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using GraphPad InStat tm (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The differences between the BRSV-inoculated and mock-inoculated calves in Table 4 were tested for statistical significance using Fisher\u00d5s exact test, while Spearman\u00d5s correlation coefficient was used to investigate correlations between neutralising antibodies and clinical parameters, as well as in-between clinical parameters (Table 3) .\n\nBaselines for recording of clinical signs and pathological changes were determined from the 6-21-weeklong monitoring of the 46 calves before inoculation, and from the findings in the nine control calves after mockinoculation, respectively. The baselines were set at a respiratory rate of 40 per minute, a rectal temperature of 39.3\u00b0C and 5% consolidation of the lung tissue.\n\nNumber of days with clinical signs and nasal excretion of BRSV between day 0 and 8 PI are summarised in Table 1 .\n\nExcept for a febrile reaction and a lung score of 2 in one control calf in exp. III and one control calf with a respiratory rate of 52 on day 1 PI in exp. IV, there were no signs of disease in the mock-inoculated control animals (Table 1) . Daily nasal swabs were free from BRSV antigen, and lung tissue samples were free from BRSV antigen and live BRSV.\n\nRespiratory disease was induced in all of the eight experiments (Table 1) , as the majority of the BRSV-infected animals in each experiment (67-100%) developed respiratory rates above 40 min \u00c01 for 1-5 days between day 4 and 8 PI, which in 67-100% of the sick animals was accompanied by febrile reactions. BRSV excretion, demonstrated as antigen in nasal swabs, was found in 67-100% of the BRSV-infected calves in each of the experiments (Table 1) .\n\nClinical signs and virus shedding were accompanied by enhanced vesicular or bronchial respiration, nasal discharge, coughing, and varying degrees of anorexia and depression (data not shown).\n\nTemporal development in average respiratory rates and in average rectal temperatures from inoculation to slaughter are shown for calves inoculated with lung lavage fluid based inocula in Fig. 2I and for calves inoculated with cell culture passaged inocula in Fig. 2II . For clarity, data have been pooled for experiments using BRSV BRSV CCP3 (Va, VI, VIII, and IX). Both lung lavage BRSV-inoculum and cell culture passaged BRSV-inocula induced increases in average respiratory rates and average rectal temperatures on day 4-6 PI; accordingly the two BRSV-inoculated calves killed on day 2 PI did not show any signs of respiratory disease. Average rectal temperatures returned to normal levels around day 8-9 PI, while average respiratory rate remained high until day 13 PI (based on five calves).\n\nAfter day 4 PI, the average rectal temperature in BRSV BRSV LLF-inoculated calves (Figs. 2I and B) was higher in the remaining colostrum-deprived calf than in the colostrum-fed calves (seven calves); however, two of the colostrum-fed calves had as severe febrile reactions as the colostrum-deprived calf. This situation illustrates the effect of the variation in time of onset (1-2 days) and in severity of clinical disease between individual calves on the average values. As a consequence we have also considered the individual peak respiratory rate, peak rectal A Clinical signs and excretion of BRSV from day 0 to day 8 PI and results from necropsy. a According to Fig. 1 temperature and peak titre of BRSV in nasal swabs in the 35 BRSV-infected calves which were killed on day 4 PI and later (Table 2) . Median values were 72 min \u00c01 for peak respiratory rate, 39.9\u00b0C for peak rectal temperature, and 64 (2 6 ) for peak titre of BRSV in nasal swabs. Peak rectal temperature correlated with peak respiratory rate, peak titre in nasal swabs and lung score, and peak respiratory rate correlated with peak titre in nasal swabs and lung score, while peak titre in nasal swabs did not correlate significantly with lung score (Table 3) . Substantial pneumonic lesions, manifested as lobular, dark red, consolidated areas with mucopurulent exudate in the bronchi, were typically detected in the cranioventral parts of the lungs from day 4 PI in BRSV-inoculated calves (Table 1) . Thus, moderate to severe lung consolidation (lung scores 2 or above) was present in 0/2 calves killed on day 2 PI (0%), 3/6 killed on day 4 PI (50%), 22/24 killed on days 6-8 PI (92%), 1/2 killed on day 15 PI (50%), and 1/3 killed on day 30 PI (33%). Interstitial oedema was seen in most BRSV-infected calves, whereas emphysema was seen in animals killed on day 6 and 8 PI. The emphysema was especially pronounced in the caudal lobes, and less frequently seen in the medial and accessory lobes. The incidence of emphysema rose with increasing lung score; lung score 0-2: 0/18 (0%), lung score 3: 2/10 (20%), lung score 4: 3/6 (50%), and lung score 5: 3/3 (100%) (data not shown). A detailed description of the replication and clearance of BRSV in these calves is given elsewhere (Viuff et al., accepted) . Immunohistochemistry revealed BRSV antigen in a few scattered bronchial epithelial cells in calves killed on day 2 PI, and in a high number of bronchial epithelial cells on day 4 PI. Large amounts of BRSV antigen were found in bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells on day 6-8 PI (Fig. 3) . The pathological lesions were clearly associated with the presence of BRSV as a shift in the main lesions from bronchitis to bronchiolitis and alveolitis was observed corresponding to the sites where BRSV was detected. BRSV antigen was not detected in lung tissue samples from calves killed on days 15 and 30 PI or from mock-inoculated control calves.\n\nThe microscopical lesions were characteristic for BRSV-related pneumonia featuring formation of syncytial cells, hyperplasia of bronchial epithelium with loss of cilia, influx of neutrophils, plugging of bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli, collapse of alveoli, interstitial oedema, and emphysema (Fig. 3) . From day 15 PI the overall impression was repair.\n\nThe antigen ELISA detected BRSV in lung tissue from 24/25 animals killed between day 4 and 7 PI and from 3/5 calves killed on day 8 PI, while lung tissue samples from calves killed on days 2, 15, and 30 PI were negative (Table 1) . Antigen titres in the 143 BRSV-positive lung samples (Table 1 ) ranged between 2 and >128 \u00f02 1 to > 2 7 \u00de (median value 64 (2 6 ), interquartil range 32-128 \u00f02 5 -2 7 \u00de). Detection of BRSV by isolation on FBL cells preceded detection of antigen by ELISA, while the ELISA demonstrated BRSV later in the course of the infection.\n\nThe results from the 39 colostrum-fed calves, which were killed on day 4 PI or later, have been summarised in Table 4 . A total of 91% of BRSV-inoculated calves (29/32) developed respiratory rates above 40 min \u00c01 , 72% (23/32) had febrile reactions and 91% (29/32) excreted BRSV. Animals killed on day 30 PI have been excluded from lung score due to unknown degree of repair, and animals killed on day 15 and 30 PI from BRSV in lung tissue due to disappearance of antigen after day 8 PI. Thus 83% (24/29) had lung scores above 1 and 89% (24/27) contained BRSV antigen in the lung tissue at slaughter. In contrast, none of the mock-inoculated calves exhibited signs of disease after inoculation. Using Fisher\u00d5s exact test all five parameters were significantly more prevalent in the BRSV-inoculated calves as compared to the mock-inoculated calves (two-tailed P-value < 0:005).\n\nThe colostrum-deprived calves were free from neutralising BRSV-specific antibodies at the time of inoculation, while the colostrum-fed calves had varying levels of maternally derived neutralising antibodies (range <2-362 NPLA 50 , median value 91 NPLA 50 , interquartil range 10-256 NPLA 50 ). However, the neutralising antibody titre at inoculation did not correlate with peak respiratory rate (r \u00bc \u00c00:002765, 95%-confidence-interval: )0.4000-0.3953, two-tailed P-value \u00bc 0.6060), peak rectal temperature (r \u00bc 0:1475, 95%-confidence-interval: )0.2497-0.5022, two-tailed P-value \u00bc 0.4537) or lung score (r \u00bc 0:08926, 95%-confidence-interval: )0.2904-0.4446, two-tailed P-value \u00bc 0.6390) in BRSV-inoculated, colostrum-fed calves.\n\nLow neutralising titres tended to rise from day 6 PI, while calves with a higher pre-infection titre generally showed a decrease in titre. The neutralising antibody response appeared to develop slightly earlier (Tj\u00f8rneh\u00f8j, 2000) than the IgG1 response, which is described by Uttenthal et al. (2000) . Table 3 Correlations in-between lung score and peak values for respiratory rate, rectal temperature, and titre in nasal swabs in the 35 BRSV-infected calves which were killed on day 4 PI or later Sign \n\nAll cell culture based inocula (exp. V-XI) were free from interfering bovine pathogens.\n\nIn contrast, the lung lavage fluid inocula (BRSV BRSV LLF, CTR CTR LLFa, and CTR CTR LLFb) were infected with Mycoplasma dispar (exp. III and IV), and CTR CTRLLFa was infected with BCV (exp. III).\n\nAt postmortem, bronchial swabs from 67% of the control calves and from 78% of the BRSV-inoculated calves contained M. dispar, while the corresponding figures for Ureaplasma spp. were 33% and 38%. Mycoplasma bovirhinis was recovered from one control and two BRSV-inoculated calves, while three BRSV-infected calves had Pasteurella multocida, one Pasteurella avium, and two Haemophilus somnus in the lung tissue. In experiment III, all five calves excreted BCV, which was also detected in lung tissue from calves killed on day 4 PI.\n\nSero-conversions to PI-3, BCV, or BAV were not detected in any of the calves.\n\nIn this study, moderate to severe BRSV-induced pneumonia was reproduced in seven experiments in colostrum-fed calves and in one experiment in colostrum-deprived calves. Nasal shedding of BRSV and recovery of BRSV from the lungs at necropsy, in particular the constant demonstration of BRSV antigen in affected lung tissue from BRSV-infected calves by immunohistochemistry, confirmed that this virus caused the disease. The described experimental BRSV-infections were confined to the respiratory system as demonstrated in a previously published systematic screening of other tissues for BRSV by RT-PCR, however, BRSVspecific RNA was detected in the tracheobronchal lymph node from some of the calves killed between day 2 and 6 PI (Larsen et al., 1999) .\n\nThe severity of the elicited parameters of respiratory disease varied amongst individual calves, but the peak values of respiratory rate, rectal temperature, and titre of BRSV in nasal swabs were significantly correlated with each other, and the peak respiratory rate and rectal temperature correlated significantly with lung score. Likewise, emphysema, a sign of severe respiratory distress, was only noted in severely affected calves. Thus, it is verified that the measured parameters of respiratory disease were associated with each other and caused by the BRSV-infection. The variation amongst individual animals was comparable between our individual experiments.\n\nThis disease pattern, the clinical signs and the distribution and character of lung lesions in the BRSV-inoculated calves equalled descriptions of BRSV-related pneumonia in naturally infected calves (Belknap, 1993; Bryson, 1993; Kimman et al., 1989; Pirie et al., 1981; Viuff et al., 1996) . The severity of elicited pneumonia did not correlate to the level of maternally derived neutralising antibodies at inoculation; and after the successful inoculation of colostrum-fed calves in experiment IV, we decided to focus on this type of calves to establish a more natural experimental model. Only 2/6 BRSV-inoculated calves killed on day 4 PI had signs of disease, but, since lung tissue samples of all six calves were positive for BRSV by both isolation and antigen ELISA, they were probably incubating the disease. Consistently, the two healthy BRSV-inoculated calves killed on day 2 PI had a few BRSV-infected bronchial epithelial cells.\n\nThe acute phase of the infection, manifested by nasal virus excretion, febrile reaction, and presence of viral antigen in the lungs, had almost ended by day 8 PI, while nasal discharge, coughing and consolidation of lung tissue persisted until day 15 and 30 PI in some animals, indicating a prolonged reparatory state in the lung tissue. According to the average respiratory rates presented in Fig. 2 , enhanced respiratory rates seemed to cease around day 13-15 PI. However, one of the three calves killed on day 30 PI maintained enhanced respiratory rate until this day, and more recent experimental BRSV-infections using our model has confirmed longterm respiratory distress in some of the infected animals (unpublished data).\n\nThe degree of respiratory disease achieved in these experiments was more distinct than in most previous studies using single inoculation of conventionally reared calves (Belknap et al., 1995) . However, Elazhary et al. (1980) , West et al. (1999), and Woolums et al. (1999) have obtained comparable levels of clinical signs with one inoculation. One common factor between these three successful studies and the present model is the exposure to BRSV in an aerosol delivered by a nebulizer over an extended period of time, and we believe this has been crucial for the induction of disease.\n\nThe exact mode of transmission during a natural BRSV-infection has not yet been unambiguously defined. It has been demonstrated that the human RSV virus is probably very commonly transferred by contact spread of large droplets between high-risk patients in hospitals (Hall and Douglas, 1981) , while Mars et al. (1999) recently demonstrated experimentally that BRSV can be transmitted by air between groups of calves in adjacent rooms. The pathological lesions seen after the combined aerosol and intratracheal exposure in the present study closely resembled the pathological lesions in acute BRSV-related pneumonia in the field (Bryson, 1993; Kimman et al., 1989; Pirie et al., 1981; Viuff et al., 1996) ; moreover, the infection progressed from the upper to the lower respiratory tract during 4-6 days (Viuff et al., accepted) . Taken together, these findings indicate that the inoculation with aerosol for 10 min is probably quite close to the field exposure, where calves due to the close housing are continuously exposed to BRSV during an outbreak.\n\nIn experiment III, mock-inoculated and BRSV-inoculated calves experienced a co-infection with BCV, which presumably originated from the BCV-infected mock-inoculum and reached the BRSV-inoculated calves through the contaminated inhalator. This infection probably caused the slightly higher rectal temperature in the colostrum-deprived control calf on day 4-8 PI, and it may also have influenced the rectal temperature of the colostrum-deprived, BRSV-inoculated calf (Figs. 2I and B). However, due to the limited number of animals in this experiment, this is merely a speculation.\n\nPasteurella multocida, P. avium, and H. somnus were infrequently recovered from BRSV-inoculated calves, while mycoplasmas were isolated from most BRSV-inoculated calves as well as from control calves in the present study, indicating that the calves were harbouring mycoplasmas at the time of infection. However, there was no clear correlation between degree of respiratory disease and recovery of bacteria, as bacteria could be found in both animals with widespread and limited extent of lung consolidation, and some calves without bacterial infection displayed serious lung lesions. Moreover, respiratory disease was also induced in the enrofloxacin-treated calves in exp. XI.\n\nThe interfering bacterial and mycoplasmal airway pathogens in this study are also commonly recovered from the respiratory system of healthy calves (Thomas and Smith, 1972; Woldehiwet et al., 1990a; 29/32 0/6 91 0 Lung score above 1 e 24/29 a 0/6 83 0 BRSV in lung tissue e 24/27 b 0/5 b 89 0 a The three BRSV-inoculated calves killed on day 30 PI have been excluded due to unknown degree of repair in the lung tissue. b The five BRSV-inoculated calves and the one mock-inoculated calf killed on days 15 and 30 PI have been excluded due to disappearance of BRSV from the lung tissue after day 8 PI.\n\nc Two-tailed P-value < 0:0001. d Two-tailed P-value \u00bc 0.0018. e Two-tailed P-value \u00bc 0.0003. et al., 1990b); essentially Woldehiwet et al. (1990b) were unable to associate isolation rates of mycoplasmas with respiratory disease in calves. Besides, the character of the induced pneumonias in the present study differ from those recorded in experimental infection studies with H. somnus (Jackson et al., 1987) , P. multocida (Gourlay et al., 1989) , and mycoplasmas (Friis, 1980; Friis, 1981; Howard et al., 1976; Tanskanen, 1984) . Hence, though it cannot be ruled out that bacteria or mycoplasmas may have played a contributing role in the clinical course of the disease, the combination of cell culture based inoculum and thorough examination of inocula as well as experimental calves for other bovine pathogens made it possible to exclude that they played a primary etiological role in the present study. Thus, we have by consistent experimental reproduction of moderate to severe disease clearly demonstrated the capability of BRSV as a primary etiologic agent of acute pneumonia in calves.\n\nOn day 2 PI, BRSV could only be detected in the lung tissue by immunohistochemistry, PCR (Larsen et al., 1999) and isolation, indicating that these methods were more sensitive than the presented antigen ELISA. However, the ELISA detected BRSV later in the course of infection than the isolation method, in lung tissue as well as in nasal swabs (Tj\u00f8rneh\u00f8j, 2000) . Whether this was caused by the presence of neutralising antibodies or other inhibiting immunological factors, or by the die off of the BRSV particles, leaving antigen for a few more days, is not known.\n\nIn conclusion, we have established a reproducible experimental model for BRSV-infection using a Danish field strain of BRSV. This model was capable of inducing clinical signs resembling natural cases of BRSVrelated pneumonia in 80% of the infected conventionally reared calves, and hence mimics the field conditions closely. Consequently, it may be a valuable tool for studying the pathogenesis of BRSV-infection and for vaccine efficacy studies. Studies on these issues have been published elsewhere (Heegaard et al., 2000; Larsen et al., 1998; Larsen et al., 1999; R\u00f8ntved et al., 2000; Uttenthal et al., 2000; Viuff et al., accepted) ."}
