This is the first observation of an association between the ABO blood type and COVID-19. It should be emphasized, however, that this is an early study with limitations. It would be premature to use this study to guide clinical practice at this time, but it should encourage further investigation of the relationship between the ABO blood group and the COVID-19 susceptibility.\n\n.

Recent clinical observation suggests that patient age, male sex and certain chronic medical conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD) seem to represent a risk for the infection of SARS-Cov-2 and higher disease severity 1 . There is currently no biological marker known to predict the susceptibility to COVID-19. Landsteiner's ABO blood types are carbohydrate epitopes that are present on the surface of human cells. The antigenic determinants of A and B blood groups are trisaccharide moieties GalNAc\u03b11-3-(Fuc\u03b11,2)-Gal\u03b2-and Gal\u03b11-3-(Fuc\u03b11,2)-Gal\u03b2-, while O blood group antigen is Fuc\u03b11,2-Gal\u03b2-. While blood types are genetically inherited, the environment factors can potentially influence which blood types in a population will be passed on more frequently to the next generation. Susceptibility of viral infection has been previously found to be related to ABO blood group. For example, Norwalk virus and Hepatitis B have clear blood group susceptibility 2,3 . It was also reported that blood group O individuals were less likely to become infected by SARS coronavirus 4 . Here, we investigated the relationship between the ABO blood type and the susceptibility to COVID-19 in patients from three hospitals in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China to test if the former may be a biomarker for the latter.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Two recent surveys of ABO blood group distribution of 3,694 normal people from Wuhan City and 23,386 normal people from Shenzhen City were used as comparison controls for the Wuhan and Shenzhen patients with COVID-19, respectively 5-6 . Statistical analyses were performed using chi-squared test. Data from different hospitals were meta-analyzed using random effects models, with calculation of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 16.0) and STATA software (version 13).\n\nThe ABO blood group in 3,694 normal people in Wuhan displayed a percentage distribution of 32.16%, 24.90%, 9.10% and 33.84% for A, B, AB and O, respectively, while the 1,775 patients with COVID-19 from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital showed an ABO distribution of 37.75%, 26.42%, 10.03% and 25.80% for A, B, AB and O, respectively. The proportion of blood group A in patients with COVID-19 was significantly higher than that in normal people, being 37.75% in the former vs 32.16% All rights reserved.

The proportion of blood group O in patients with was significantly lower than that in normal people, being 25.80% in the former vs 33.84% in the later (P < 0.001, Table 1 ). These results corresponded to a significantly increased risk of blood group A for COVID-19 with an OR of 1.279 (95% CI 1.136~1.440) and decreased risk of blood group O for COVID-19 with an OR of 0.680 (95% CI 0.599~0.771, Table 1 ) in comparison with non-A groups and non-O groups, respectively.\n\nA similar distribution pattern of high-risk blood group A and low-risk blood group O was also observed in the dead patients. Specifically, the proportions of blood groups A, B, AB and O in the 206 dead patients were 41.26%, 24.27%, 9.22% and 25.24%, respectively. Blood group A was associated with a higher risk of death compared with non-A groups, with an OR of 1.482 (95% CI 1.113~1.972, P = 0.008, Table 1 ). To the contrary, blood group O was associated with a lower risk of death compared with non-O groups, with an OR of 0.660 (95% CI 0.479~0.911, P = 0.014, Table 1 ).\n\nWe next examined 113 patients with COVID-19 from another hospital in Wuhan City, the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, and found a similar risk distribution trend of ABO blood groups for the infection. Specifically, compared with non-A blood groups, blood group A displayed higher relative risk (OR=1.396; 95% CI 0.952~2.048) than those observed in patients from Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, although the associations did not reach statistical significance likely due to the small sample size.

These results also showed blood group AB to have an increased risk of infection (OR, 2.008; 95% CI 1.427~2.824, Table 1 ). Figure 1 shows the estimates of ORs of the risk of ABO blood groups for COVID-19 on the pooled data from the three hospitals by random effects models.\n\nAgain, the results showed that blood group A was associated with a significantly higher risk for COVID-19 (OR, 1.21; 95% CI 1.02~1.43, P = 0.027) compared with non-A blood groups, whereas blood group O was associated with a significantly lower risk for the infection (OR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.60~0.75, P < 0.001) compared with non-O blood groups. Compared with other ABO blood groups, AB blood group (OR, 1.48, 95% CI 0.97~2.24) and B blood group (OR, 1.09, 95% CI 0.98~1.22) seemed to have a trend of higher risk for infection, but the association did not reach statistical significance.\n\nWe next investigated whether patient age and sex might influence the ABO blood group distribution among patients with COVID-19.

When all patients from Jinyintan Hospital and Renmin Hospital in Wuhan city were combined (1,888 patients in total) and grouped into three age groups (<40, 41-59, >60 years old), the ABO blood group distribution was similar among the three age groups (Table S1 ). The ABO blood group distribution was also similar between male and female patients with COVID-19 (Table S1 ). These results are consistent with the fact that the distribution of ABO blood groups is known to have no sex and age predilections. For example, by analyzing the blood type of more than ninety thousands normal people, it was found that the percentage of A, B, AB and O blood types were essentially the same among different age groups and among different sexes. 7\n\nIn this study, we found that ABO blood groups displayed different association risks for the infection with SARS-CoV-2 resulting in COVID-19. Specifically, blood group A was associated with an increased risk whereas blood group O was associated with a decreased risk, thus demonstrating that the ABO blood type is a biomarker for The authors found that compared with non-O blood group hospital staff, blood group All rights reserved.

Patrice et al. found that anti-A antibodies specifically inhibited the adhesion of SARS-CoV S protein-expressing cells to ACE2-expressing cell lines 7 . Given the nucleic acid sequence similarity 8 and receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 9-11 , the lower susceptibility of blood group O and higher susceptibility of blood group A for COVID-19 could be linked to the presence of natural anti-blood group antibodies, particularly anti-A antibody, in the blood. This speculation will need direct studies to prove. There may also be other mechanisms underlying the ABO blood group-differentiated susceptibility for COVID-19 that require further studies to elucidate.\n\nThis study has several limitations. 1) The numbers of patients from the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and Shenzhen Third People's Hospital were both small. Therefore, they cannot represent a solid replication analysis, although the data from these two hospitals showed similar risk patterns of ABO blood groups. 2) The control population groups used in this study lacked information on the subject age and sex and, therefore, a multivariate analysis to adjust the effect of the two factors was not possible.\n\nThis, however, may not necessarily be a major issue since the ABO blood group distribution was similar among different age and sex groups of patients in the present study and in normal population reported previously 7 .\n\n3) Due to incomplete information, the influence of the status of chronic medical conditions, such as All rights reserved.

Specifically, people with blood group A have a higher risk It should be emphasized, however, that given the above limitations, it would be premature to use this study to guide clinical practice at this time. Large replication studies with complete information should be encouraged to pursue and are needed to verify the present findings.
