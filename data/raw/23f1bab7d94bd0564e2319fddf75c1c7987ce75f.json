{"title": "Complex dynamics in an SIS epidemic model induced by nonlinear incidence", "body": "In generic, the population, for an SIS model, is always separated into two compartments, susceptible and infective individuals. And, in most SIS epidemic models (see Anderson and May [2] ), the incidence takes the mass-action form with bilinear interactions. However, in practical, to describe the transmission process more realistic, it is necessary to introduce the nonlinear contact rates [1] .\n\nActually, various forms of nonlinear incidence rates have been proposed recently. For example, in order to incorporate the effect of behavioral changes, Liu, Levin, and Iwasa [3] used a nonlinear incidence rate of the form\n\nwhere \u03baI \u03b9 represents the force of infection of the disease, 1/(1 + \u03b1I h ) is a description of the suppression effect from the behavioral change of susceptible individuals when the infective population increases. \u03b9, h and \u03ba are all positive constants, and \u03b1 is a nonnegative constant. See also Hethcote and van den Driessche [4] , Moghadas [5] and Alexander and Moghadas [6, 7] , etc.\n\nIn [10] , Ruan discuss a specific infection force g 1 (I) = \u03baI 1 + \u03b1I 2 , Graphs of different incidence rate functions. (a) Nonmonotone incidence g 1 (I) = \u03baI 1+\u03b1I 2 (\u03ba = \u03b1 = 1). (b) Nonlinear incidence g 2 (I) = \u03baI 2 1+\u03b1I 2 (\u03ba = \u03b1 = 1). (c) Nonlinear and nonmonotone incidence rate G(I) = aI 2 I 2 +c + bI I 2 +c (a = c = 1, b = 0.5).\n\nsee Fig. 1 (a), which can describe the effects of psychology function caused by protection measures and intervention policies. Obviously, g 1 (I) is increasing with small I and decreasing with large I, that is, g 1 (I) is non-monotone. The function g 1 (I) can be used to interpret the psychological effect: for a very large number of infective individuals, the infection force may decrease as the number of infective individuals increases, since large number of infective may lead to the reducing of the number of contacts per unit time. For example, in 2003, epidemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had such psychological effects on the general public (see [11] ), and aggressive measures and policies had been taken, such as border screening, mask wearing, quarantine, isolation, etc. And also [11] showed that either the number of infective individuals tends to zero as time evolves or the disease persists. Furthermore, Li, Zhao and Zhu (see [20] ) studied the following SIS model, which describes behavior change effect of susceptible individual when infectious population increases dS dt = \u039b \u2212 d 0 S \u2212 g 2 (I)S + \u03b4I, dI dt = g 2 (I)S \u2212 (d 0 + d + \u03b4)I,\n\nwhere g 2 (I) = \u03b1I 2 1 + \u03b2 0 I 2 , see Fig. 1 (b). By the qualitative and bifurcation analyses, they showed that the maximal multiplicity of weak focus is 2, and proved that the model can undergo a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 2. These results illustrate that the behavior change of the susceptible individuals may affect the final spread level of an epidemic.\n\nActually, both the effect of psychological and behavior affect of susceptible individuals have influence on the transmission of the disease. Thus, motivated by the above researches, we consider a nonlinear incidence rate of a SIS model as follows\n\nwhere G(I) = aI 2 c + I 2 + bI c + I 2 , see Fig. 1 (c), which can describe the effect of psychology and behavior change of susceptible individuals. S(t) and I(t) represent the number of susceptible individuals and infected individuals at time t, respectively. \u039b is the recruitment rate of population, d is the natural death, \u00b5 is the disease-induced death rate, and \u03c3 represents the recovered rate, a, b and c are all positive constants.\n\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. First of all, we analyze the existence of equilibria and local stability of equilibria. Then, we study the existence of Hopf bifurcation around the positive equilibrium at the critical value under the conditions of R 0 < 1 and R 0 > 1. We also show that these positive equilibria can be weak focus for some parameter values and a cusp type of Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 3. Finally, we give some brief conclusion.\n\nIn this section, our aim is to perform an elaborative analysis of equilibria for system (2) .\n\nFirstly, for convenience, we make scalings:\n\nTo avoid the abuse of mathematical notation, we still denote (\u039b , a , d , \u03c3 , c , \u03c4 ) by (\u039b, a, d, \u03c3, c, t). Then model (2) becomes\n\nwith d + \u03c3 < 1.\n\nProof Summing up the two equations in (3), we can get\n\nThus, lim sup t\u2192\u221e (x + y) \u2264 \u039b d , which implies the conclusion. Obviously, system (3) always has a unique disease-free equilibrium E 0 = ( \u039b d , 0). The positive equilibria of (3) can be gained by solving the following algebraic equations \u039b \u2212 xy(ay + 1) y 2 + c \u2212 dx + \u03c3y = 0, xy(ay + 1)\n\nDenote the basic reproduction number as follows,\n\nComputing the discriminant of (4), we get\n\nFurthermore, define\n\n,\n\nalways has a disease-free equilibrium E 0 and the following conclusions hold.\n\n(i) When R 0 < 1, we have (a) if R 0 < R * , then system (3) has no positive equilibrium; (b) if R 0 = R * and \u039b > (1 \u2212 \u03c3)/a, then system (3) has a unique positive equilibrium In the following, we discuss the local stability of E k (x k , y k ) (k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and present the corresponding phase portrait. By directly calculating, the Jacobian matrix at equilibrium E k is\n\nWe have\n\nIn addition, after some complicated computations, we get\n\n.\n\nProof Obviously, at equilibrium E 0 , we have det(J 0 ) = d(1 \u2212 R 0 ) and Tr(J 0 ) = \u2212d \u2212 (1 \u2212 R 0 ). Therefore, E 0 is a stable node if R 0 < 1 and a hyperbolic saddle if R 0 > 1, and degenerate if R 0 = 1.\n\nIndeed, if R 0 = 1, the Jacobian J 0 is diagonalizable with eigenvalues \u03bb 1 = \u2212d and \u03bb 2 = 0 and respective eigenvectors \u03bd 1 = (1, 0) and \u03bd 2 = (\u2212 1\u2212\u03c3 d , 1). By the transformation u\n\nsystem (5) can be rewritten as\n\nIf 2a \u2212 1\u2212\u03c3 dc = 0, according to the calculation of center manifold [15] , we know that the center manifold x = h(y) of (5) begins with quadratic term of y. In addition, from the second equation of (5), we can easily obtain that the equation restricted to the center manifold as follows\n\nBy applying the Theorem 7.1 in Zhang et al. [15] , E 0 is a saddle-node. If 2a \u2212 1\u2212\u03c3 dc = 0, then the center manifold turns into dy dt = 1 c y 3 + O(y 4 ).\n\nSince 1 c > 0 and the first nonzero item is uneven. Thus, the equilibrium E 0 is a repelling node, according to Theorem 7.1 in Zhang et al. [15] . Theorem 4 Suppose that R * < R 0 < 1 and a\u039b > 1 \u2212 \u03c3, then system (3) has two positive equilibria E 2 and E 3 , and equilibrium E 2 is a hyperbolic saddle for all permissible choices of parameters, equilibrium E 3 is not degenerate. Moreover,\n\nProof Note that \u03c6 2 is less than zero since \u2206 < (a\u039b + 1 \u2212 \u03c3) 2 , then E 2 is a hyperbolic saddle for any choices of parameters. And at E 3 , we have \u03c6 3 > 0. Thus, the stability of equilibrium E 3 depends on the sign of \u03c8 3 .\n\nTheorem 5 When R 0 = 1 and c > 1\u2212\u03c3 a , then system (3) has a unique positive equilibrium E 4 (x 4 , y 4 ), and the equilibrium E 4 is stable if \u03c8 4 < 0.\n\nProof In fact, when R 0 = 1 and c > 1\u2212\u03c3 a , then \u03c6 4 > 0. Thus, the stability of E 4 is determined by the sign of \u03c8 4 .\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/331678 doi: bioRxiv preprint Theorem 6 Assume R 0 > 1, then system (3) has a unique positive equilibrium E 5 . Moreover,\n\nProof Obviously, when R 0 > 1, then \u03c6 5 > 0, and then E 5 is stable if \u03c8 5 < 0.\n\nWhen \u03c8 i = 0 (i = 3, 5), the dynamics of system (3) can be easily seen in Fig. 2 , Fig.  3 and Fig. 4 , respectively. The dynamical behaviors of system (3) when \u03c8 i = 0 (i = 3, 5) will be discussed in detail in the next section. Remark 1 In fact, Fig. 2 (a) shows the occurrence of bi-stability, in which solution may converge to one of the two equilibria, depending on the initial conditions. And in practical, this interesting phenomenon implies that initial states determine whether the disease can dies out or not.\n\nRemark 2 From Fig. 2 (a), we can see there exists two seperatrices. All solutions tend to the disease-free equilibrium E 0 except the two green lines tend to equilibrium E 2 .\n\nTheorem 7 Suppose that R 0 = 1 and \u039b > 1\u2212\u03c3 a , then system (3) has a unique positive equilibrium E 4 . If \u03c8 4 > 0, then there exists at least one stable limit cycle in the interior of the first quadrant.\n\nProof Indeed, the Jacobian J 0 is diagonalizable with eigenvalues \u03bb 1 = \u2212d and \u03bb 2 = 0 and respective eigenvectors \u03bd 1 = (1, 0) and \u03bd 2 = (\u2212 1\u2212\u03c3 d , 1). By the transformation system (5) becomes\n\nThe theorem of Chochitaichvili [21] yields directly that system (6) is topologically equivalent to the system:\n\nIt is easy to see that 2a \u2212 1\u2212\u03c3 dc > 0 according to the condition of R 0 = 1 and \u039b > 1\u2212\u03c3 a , and then we can gain that there exist a unique repelling equilibrium E 4 in the region D 1 shown in (a) of Fig.5 . Consequently, by the Poincar\u00e9-Bendixson theorem, at least one stable limit cycle appears in the interior of the first quadrant. Similarly, when \u03c8 5 > 0, we have the following result.\n\nTheorem 8 Suppose that R 0 > 1. If \u03c8 5 > 0, then there exists at least one stable limit cycle in the interior of the first quadrant.\n\nProof Indeed, the Jacobian J 5 has eigenvalues \u03bb 1 = \u2212d and \u03bb 2 = R 0 \u2212 1 > 0, when R 0 > 1. Thus, we can gain that there exist a E 5 , which is the unique repelling equilibrium in the region D 2 shown in (b) of Fig.5 . Consequently, by the Poincar\u00e9-Bendixson theorem, at least one stable limit cycle appears in the interior of the first quadrant.\n\na and \u03c8 4 > 0, there exists a stable limit cycle. (b): When R 0 > 1 and \u03c8 5 > 0, there exists a stable limit cycle. Fig. 3 , we can see clearly that there exist a stable limit cycle enclosing the equilibrium E 5 even though E 0 is a saddle-node. Similarly, from (b) of Fig. 4 , we can also gain that there exists a stable limit cycle if E 4 is unstable.\n\nRemark 4 When R 0 = 1 and \u039b > 1\u2212\u03c3 a , system (3) exhibits a unique positive equilibrium E 4 , which means that once R 0 crosses 1, the disease can invade to a relatively high level. And this is one of the main characters of backward bifurcation [19] .\n\nRemark 5 Actually, backward bifurcation did not emerge with a = 0, which is considered in [20] . This indicates that introducing the non-motonic incidence into model (1) makes the epidemic model more complex and exhibit richer dynamical behaviors.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/331678 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nIn this subsection, we will study the Hopf bifurcation of system (3) for (i) R * < R 0 < 1 and \u039b > (1 \u2212 \u03c3)/a; (ii) R 0 > 1. From the discussion in Section 2, it can be seen that Hopf bifurcation may occur at E 3 , E 5 . As the expressions of equilibria E 3 and E 5 are same, no considering the values of every parameters. Based on Theorem 4, Theorem 5 and Theorem 6, we know that the stability of E 3 and E 5 are similar and when \u03c8 k = 0, E k (k = 3, 5) is a weak focus or center. Thus, we show the existence of Hopf bifurcation around E k (k = 3, 5).\n\nTheorem 10 Suppose E k (k = 3, 5) exist, then model (2) undergoes a Hopf bifurcation at equilibrium E k if \u03c8 k = 0. Moreover, (a) if \u03b7 < 0, there is a family of stable periodic orbits of model (3) as \u03c8 k decreases from 0;\n\n(b) if \u03b7 = 0, there are at least two limit cycles in (3), where \u03b7 will be defined below; (c) if \u03b7 > 0, there is a family of unstable periodic orbits of (3) as \u03c8 k increases from 0.\n\nProof From the above discussions, we can see that trJ k = 0 if and only if \u03c8 k = 0, and det J k > 0 when equilibrium E k exists. Therefore, the eigenvalues of J k are a pair of pure imaginary roots if \u03c8 k = 0. From direct calculations we have that\n\nBy Theorem 3.4.2 in [16] , \u03a8 k = 0 is the Hopf bifurcation point for (3). Next, introduce a new time variable \u03c4 by dt = (y 2 + c)d\u03c4 . By rewriting \u03c4 as t, we obtain the following equivalent system of (3)\n\ndy dt = xy(ay + 1) \u2212 y(y 2 + c).\n\nLet X = x \u2212 x k and Y = y \u2212 y k , still use (x, y) to express (X, Y ), then system (7) becomes\n\nLet\u00ca denote the origin of x \u2212 y plane. Since E k satisfies Eq. (3), we obtain\n\nand it is easy to verify that b 11 + b 22 = 0 if and only if \u03c8 k = 0. Let \u03c9 = (det J(\u00ca)) 1 2 , u = \u2212x and v = b11 \u03c9 x + b12 \u03c9 y, then the normal form of system (7) reads \n\nwhere f uv denotes \u2202 2 f \u2202u\u2202v (0, 0), etc. Then, by computing we obtain\n\nBy Theorem 3.4.2 and Theorem 3.4.11 in [16] , the rest claims in Theorem 10 are true.\n\nRemark 6 What need to be noted here is that the expression b 12 in Theorem 10 is nonzero. Otherwise, we have det J k = b 11 b 22 < 0, since b 11 + b 22 = 0, which is an contradiction.\n\nNext, we present examples to show that equilibrium E k can be a stable weak focus of multiplicity two, and under a small perturbation, system (3) undergoes a degenerate Hopf bifurcation and produces two limit cycles.\n\nFirstly, fix y k = 1/2 and solve for a = \u22122 + 6 (2\u22122\u039b\u2212\u03c3) . Also, fix x k = 1, based on a = \u22122 + 6 (2\u22122\u039b\u2212\u03c3) , we can get d = . Secondly, substitute these expressions into \u03b7 and through complicated computation, we can obtain \u03b7 L 1 = 81(1+2\u039b+\u03c3) 2 64(1\u22122\u039b+\u03c3) 6 (32\u039b 5 \u2212 80\u039b 4 (\u22121 +\u03c3) + 8\u039b 3 (\u221239 + 2\u03c3(\u221213 + 5\u03c3)) +4\u039b 2 (\u2212103 +\u03c3(99 + 2(24 \u2212 5\u03c3)\u03c3)) +\u03c3(140 \u2212\u03c3(139 +\u03c3(\u221221 +(\u221211 +\u03c3)\u03c3))) + 2\u039b(\u221280 +\u03c3(242 +\u03c3(\u221281 +\u03c3(\u221238 + 5\u03c3))))), with\u03c3 = 1 \u2212 \u03c3 > 0, which is the first Liapunov number of the equilibrium (0, 0) of (8). Then, we fix\u03c3 = 4/5 and solve equation \u03b7 = 0, then we get only one suitable value 0.5859 for \u039b. That is to say, if (\u03c3, \u039b, d, a, c) = (1/5, 5859, 0.2, 8, 4.741), then L 1 = 0. Furthermore, it can be seen that E k = E 3 under this group of parameters. In the following, we further compute the second Liapunov number of the equilibrium (0, 0) of system (8) by the successor function method. It is convenient to introduce polar coordinates (r, \u03b8) and rewrite system (8) in polar coordinates by x = r cos \u03b8, y = r sin \u03b8. It is clear that in a small neighborhood of the origin, the successor function D(c 0 ) of system (8) can be expressed by\n\nwhere r(\u03b8, c 0 ) is the solution of the following Cauchy problem dr d\u03b8 = R 2 (\u03b8)r 2 + R 3 (\u03b8)r 3 + R 4 (\u03b8)r 4 + R 5 (\u03b8)r 5 + . . . ,\n\nwhere R i (\u03b8) (i = 1, 2, 3 . . .) is a polynomial of (sin \u03b8, cos \u03b8), whose coefficient can be expressed by the coefficients of system (8) . We omit them here, since the expressions are too long.\n\nWith the aid of Mathematica, we get Besides, we give the numerical simulation graphs for one limit cycle and two limit cycles under small perturbations of some parameters. From Fig. 6 (a) , we can see that there exist only one limit cycle around the endemic E 3 , and Fig. 6 (b) emphasizing that if we change the values of parameters \u039b and c, an unstable homoclinic loop arise, which is shown in Fig.7 .\n\nAround equilibrium E 5 , we can gain the same result from Fig. 8 . Under the condition that parameter a, d, \u03c3 take value 5.6923, 0.11, 0.2 and change value of \u039b and c from 0.45102, 3.6062 to 0.51, 3.5972, respectively, which is a minor change, then the number of limit cycles will add one. Thus, the interior equilibrium E 5 is a stable weak focus of multiplicity two if (\u03c3, \u039b, d, a, c) = (0.2, 0.51, 0.11, 5.6923, 3.5962).\n\nAs a matter of fact, the reproduction number is equal to zero in [8, 20] , which simplifies the condition that Hopf bifurcation occur. In our model, we also comprehensively discuss the existence of Hopf bifurcation when R 0 < 1, R 0 = 1 and R 0 > 1. Besides, authors in [20] did not show the appearance of homoclinic loop, which is an interesting bifurcation phenomenon given in Fig.7 \n\nIn this subsection, we investigate the Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation in system (3). The following Lemma 3 is from Perko [17] , and Lemma 4 is Proposition 5.3 in Lamontage et al. [18] .\n\nis equivalent to the system\n\nin some small neighborhood of (0, 0) after changes of coordinates.\n\nis equivalent to the system\n\nin some small neighborhood of (0, 0) after changes of coordinates.\n\nFrom Theorem 1, we can see that there exists a unique positive equilibrium E 1 (x 1 , y 1 ) when R 0 = R * , where (1 \u2212 \u03c3) ) .\n\nFrom the proving process of Theorem 4, it is easily to know that detJ 1 = 0. And Theorem 3 suggests that the characteristic matrix J 1 possesses a zero eigenvalue with multiplicity 2 when \u03c8 1 = 0, which shows that system (3) may admit a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation. Thus, we can prove the following theorem.\n\nDefine two functions:\n\nTheorem 11 Suppose that R 0 = R * and \u03c8 1 = 0, then the only interior equilibrium E 1 of system (3) is a cusp. Moreover, (a) if f (y 1 )g(y 1 ) = 0, then E 1 is a cusp of codimension 2;\n\n(b) if f (y 1 )g(y 1 ) = 0, then E 1 is a cusp of codimension greater than or equal to 3.\n\nProof Changing the variables as X = x \u2212 x 1 , Y = y \u2212 y 1 , system (3) becomes\n\nwhere\n\nMake the non-singular linear transformation\n\n1 0\n\nx y .\n\nThen system (9) is transformed into\n\nwhere Q 2 (x, y) is a smooth function in (x, y) at least of the third order and\n\nBy Lemma 3, we obtain an topologically equivalent system of system (10)\n\nwhere b 3 = df (y 1 ) (c + y 2 1 ) 3 , b 4 + 2b 1 = \u2212 g(y 1 ) y 1 (ay 1 + 1)(y 2 1 + c) 2 . Therefore, E 1 is a cusp of codimension 2 if f (y 1 )g(y 1 ) = 0, by the results in Perko [17] , or else, E 1 is a cusp of codimension at least 3.\n\nIn fact, Theorem 11 (b) include the following three cases:\n\n(1) if f (y 1 ) = 0 and g(y 1 ) = 0, E 1 is a cusp point;\n\n(2) if f (y 1 ) = 0 and g(y 1 ) = 0, E 1 is nilpotent focus/elliptic point;\n\n(3) if f (y 1 ) = g(y 1 ) = 0, E 1 is a nilpotent focus.\n\nUnfortunately, because of the complexity of f (y 1 ) and g(y 1 ), we can not determine which of these three situations can occur theoretically. But we will show for some parameter values, f (y 1 ) = 0 and g(y 1 ) = 0, i.e. E 1 is a cusp point.\n\nIn the following, we will give an example to show that the case (b) of Theorem 11 occur.\n\nIn the first place, fix y 1 = 1/5, then from y 1 = a\u039b\u2212(1\u2212\u03c3) 2(d+a(1\u2212\u03c3)) , we can solve for \u03c3 = 1 \u2212 \u22122d+5a\u039b 5+2a . By assumptions \u03c8 1 = 0 and R 0 = R * , then from\n\nwe can get d and \u039b, where\n\n.\n\nfor any a, c > 0.

Theorem 12 When (a, d, c, \u039b, \u03c3) = (a 0 , d 0 , c 0 , \u039b 0 , \u03c3 0 ), then E 1 is a Bogdanov-Takens point of codimension 3, and the system (3) localized at E 1 is topologically equivalent to\n\nwhere G < 0.\n\nProof First of all, applying a linear transformation T 1 : (x, y) \u2192 (u, v), defined by u = x \u2212 x 1 , v = y \u2212 y 1 , we can reduce system (3) further to the form\n\nwhere , q 04 = x1(ac 3 \u221210ac 2 y 2 1 +5acy 4 1 \u22125c 2 y1+10cy 3 1 \u2212y 5 1 ) (c+y 2 1 ) 5\n\nAnother transformation T 2 : (u, v) \u2192 (x, y), defined by x = v, y = q 10 u \u2212 p 10 v, reduces system (11) to\n\nwhere a 11 = q11 q10 , a 20 = q 02 + p10q11 q10 , a 21 = q12 q10 , a 30 = q03q10+p10q12 q10 , a 40 = q 04 , b 11 = p 11 \u2212 p10q11 q10 , b 20 = p 10 p 11 \u2212 p 10 q 02 + p 02 q 10 \u2212 and other coefficients are equal to zero. Then using the near-identity transformation T 3 : (x, y) \u2192 (u, v), defined by u = x + 1 2 (a 11 + b 02 )x 2 \u2212 a 02 xy, v = y + a 20 x 2 \u2212 b 20 xy, and parameters (a 0 , d 0 , c 0 , \u039b 0 , \u03c3 0 ) make b 11 + 2a 20 = 0, so we obtain We perform a near-identity smooth change of coordinates The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

When we consider the incidence of a combination of the saturated incidence rate and a non-monotonic incidence, the codimension of Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation can be up to 3.\n\nXiao and Ruan (see [10] ) showed that either the number of infective individuals tends to zero as time evolves or the disease persists. Authors in [8, 20] proved that their epidemic model with saturated incidence rate, undergo a Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 2. When we consider the incidence of a combination of the saturated incidence rate and a non-monotonic incidence, the codimension of Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation can be up to 3.\n\nIn this paper, by combing qualitative and bifurcation analyses, we study an SIS epidemic model with the incidence rate aI 2 c+I 2 + bI c+I 2 , which can describe the inhibition effect from the behavioral change and interpret the \"psychological\" effect. In Section 2, we give a full-scale analysis for the types and stability of equilibria E i (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). We prove that system (2) can occur backward bifurcation and the backward bifurcation will disappear if a = 0. At equilibrium E i (i = 3, 5), degenerate Hopf bifurcation arises under certain conditions. When the critical condition \u03a8 i (i = 3, 5) satisfied, we calculate the Liapunov value of the weak focus and obtain the value 2 for the maximal multiplicity of weak focus, indicating that there exist at most two limit cycles around E i (i = 3, 5). In Fig. 6, and Fig. 8 , we give the phase portrait corresponding to equilibrium E 3 and E 5 about exhibiting a unique limit cycle and adding a new limit cycle after small perturbation of parameter \u039b and c. In Subsection 3.3, we proved that the model exhibits Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 2 and codimension 3, under certain conditions. If parameter a = 0, the model can just have Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation of codimension 2, shown in [20] .\n\nIn fact, we show that the model exhibits multi-stable states. This interesting phenomenon indicates that the initial states of an epidemic can determine the final states of an epidemic to extinct or not. Moreover, the periodical oscillation signify that the trend of the disease may be affected by the behavior of susceptible and the effect of psychology of the disease."}
