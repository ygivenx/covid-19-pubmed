{"title": "Antipsychotic treatment effects on cardiovascular, cancer, infection, and intentional self-harm as cause of death in patients with Alzheimer's dementia", "body": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been linked to increased mortality in several studies [1] . Autopsy studies in dementia have shown infection and cardiovascular events as the most common causes of death, with cancer being a less common cause [2, 3] . Some data suggests that cancer is less common in patients diagnosed with or suspected of suffering from AD [4] . Suicide as cause of death in AD is less investigated, as well as passive forms of self-harm, although small studies [5, 6] have shown both to be more frequent in patients with AD.\n\nCurrent antipsychotic treatment in patients diagnosed with AD increases all-cause mortality, as well as death from specific causes, e.g. cerebrovascular events in which an increased risk has been demonstrated using evidence from randomized controlled trials [7, 8] . Nevertheless, other studies have shown benefits from shortterm antipsychotic treatment in reducing Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms in Dementia (BPSD), although studies with long follow-up have been sparse [9] . We have previously shown that lifetime cumulative antipsychotic drug dosages and all-cause mortality are associated [10] , suggesting that the negative effects on mortality by antipsychotics could not be outweighed by the effects of antipsychotics on BPSD. So far, no studies have investigated the effects of cumulative antipsychotic treatment in patients diagnosed with AD for specific causes of death. As cardiovascular events and infection are the two most common causes of death in this population, we chose to include these as outcome measures. The choice to include cancer was undertaken, as antipsychotics have been proposed to increase the risk of cancer development, and as cancer is a common cause of Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common disease causing dementia, is linked to increased mortality. However, the effect of antipsychotic use on specific causes of mortality has not yet been investigated thoroughly. Methods: Utilizing the Danish nationwide registers, we defined a cohort of patients diagnosed with AD. Utilizing separate Cox regressions for specific causes of mortality, we investigated the effects of cumulative antipsychotic dosage after diagnosis and current antipsychotic exposure in the time period 2000-2011.\n\nResults: In total, 45,894 patients were followed for 3,803,996 person-years. A total of 6129 cardiovascular related deaths, 2088 cancer related deaths, 1620 infection related deaths, and 28 intentional self-harm related deaths are presented. Current antipsychotic exposure increased mortality rate with HR between 1.92 and 2.31 for cardiovascular, cancer, and infection related death. Cumulative antipsychotic dosages were most commonly associated with increased rates of mortality for cardiovascular and infection as cause of death, whereas the associations were less clear with cancer and intentional self-harm as cause of death.\n\nConclusions: We showed that cumulative antipsychotic drug dosages increased mortality rates for cardiovascular and infection as cause of death. These findings highlight the need for further investigations of long-term effects of treatment and of possible sub-groups who could benefit from treatment. C 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Lastly, we chose to include intentional self-harm, as this outcome is very rare, and would most likely only be investigated utilizing larger datasets, as ours.\n\nIn this study, we examine the effect of cumulative antipsychotic drug dosages, as well as the effect of current antipsychotic exposure, on the rate of different causes of death in patients diagnosed with AD.\n\nA nationwide, population-based, retrospective cohort study of specific cause mortality (cardiovascular, cancer, infection, and intentional self-harm) in patients diagnosed with dementia in AD.\n\nWe formed a cohort of newly diagnosed patients with AD, which we defined as either receiving an ICD-10 F00x. (Dementia in Alzheimer's disease) or a G30x. (Alzheimer's disease) diagnosis or picking up a prescription for anti-dementia drugs (ATC N06D), from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2011 from the total Danish population. Persons previously diagnosed with an ICD-8 dementia diagnosis in the period from January 1, 1980 throughout 1993, or an ICD-10 diagnosis of dementia in the period from January 1, 1994 throughout 1999 were excluded from the analysis, as well as patients picking up a prescription for anti-dementia drugs in the period January 1, 1998 to December 31, 1999.\n\nAll medication variables were coded as time-dependent variables, with patients being coded as non-exposed until first prescription.\n\nAntipsychotics were defined as ATC N05A, excluding lithium (ATC N05AN).\n\nThe current exposure variable was based on the use of antipsychotics over the previous year and grouped as present or absent, with index defined as a prescription for an antipsychotic drug. The cumulative antipsychotic dosages from dementia diagnosis until end of study for each participant were calculated and divided into 5 groups: baseline: no antipsychotic treatment at all; more than zero daily defined dosages (DDD) < 90; 90 DDDs < 365; 365 DDDs < 730; 730 DDDs.\n\nBecause of the definitions, no patients currently exposed to antipsychotics could be in the baseline cumulative exposure group. The groups were defined arbitrarily, but the definition has been utilized before in a similar study [10] .\n\nThe current Danish registers do not include data on severity of AD, and cognitive function. To compensate for these deficits, we used the following variables as proxy markers of disease severity: number of psychiatric bed days, number of psychiatric outpatient contacts, and accommodation status after diagnosis. All markers were examined after incident dementia diagnosis (as defined by either the ICD-10 diagnosis or the first prescription of antidementia drug).\n\nAccommodation status was dichotomized as a time-dependent variable (never previously lived in an institution or lived in an institution at some point in time after the diagnosis).\n\nWe defined a psychiatric co-morbidity score ranging from zero to five and determined by the aggregated diagnosis status in the following categories: psychosis, affective disorders, substance misuse, other psychiatric diagnosis, and intentional self-harm. The score was computed for each patient, and could increase over time, if more diagnoses were given. The score was cumulative for all patients since the initiation of the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Registry in 1969. The score has previously been utilized in a similar study [10] .\n\nWe divided somatic diseases into the following groups: cardiovascular disease, cancer, infection, diabetes, epilepsy, lower respiratory disease, and other somatic diseases. For the somatic comorbid score, one point was added for a diagnosis in each of the groups unless the diagnosis occurred before the age of 51 years for males and 56 years for females, where two points were added due to an increased risk associated with early onset of disease. The score was computed for each patient, and could increase over time, if more diagnoses were given. The score was cumulative for all patients since the initiation of the Danish Nation Patient Registry in 1977. The score has previously been utilized in a similar study [10] .\n\nThe current Danish registers do not include data on blood pressure or blood test results, such as lipid and glucose levels. Besides, general practitioners examining and treating the majority of patients diagnosed with hypertension, increased lipids, or type II diabetes do not register diagnoses in the Danish registers. To make up for this information gap, we used the following proxy measures of arterial hypertension, increased cholesterol, and diabetes: data on the prescription of antihypertensive drugs (ATC C02), drugs used to lower lipids (ATC C10), and drugs for treatment of diabetes (blood glucose lowering drugs (excl. insulins): ATC A10B, A10XA; insulins: ATC A10A), in addition to the actual diagnoses (see above under somatic co-morbid disease). All medication variables were coded as time-dependent variables, with patients being coded as non-exposed until first prescription.\n\nCox regressions with event defined as specific cause of mortality were conducted using cumulative antipsychotic dosage and current antipsychotic exposure as explanatory variables, and adjusting for variables defined above. All variables were coded as time-dependent.\n\nIn order to investigate the effects of an association between cumulative exposure and current exposure, secondary analyses were conducted for the different specific causes of death listed above, excluding current exposure as an explanatory variable.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed with Stata 13 at the Statistics Denmark server with remote access.\n\nIn total, 45,894 patients (17,082 males and 28,812 females) were followed for 3,803,996 person-years, presenting 27,894 deaths (10,818 males and 17,076 females) in the study population. Patients were mainly treated with second generation antipsychotic drug (12,216 patients, 4850 male, 7366 female), with fewer treated with typical antipsychotic drugs (4760 patients, 1943 male and 2817 female). The most commonly prescribed antipsychotic drugs were risperidone (40% of all treated), quetiapine (36% of all treated), olanzapine (21% of all treated), haloperidole (15% of all treated), zuclopenthixole (6% of all treated), and chlorprothixene (4% of all treated).\n\nA total of 6129 cardiovascular related deaths (13.6% of all deaths) (2391 males and 3738 females) were presented in the study population.\n\nIn total, 2100 patients (884 males and 1216 females) with cardiovascular related deaths were exposed to antipsychotics at some point. The mean age at death in the exposed group was 84.64 years (SD = 6.63), [males 83.22 years (SD = 6.83); females 85.68 years (SD = 6.29)].\n\nThe cumulative dosages of antipsychotic treatment after AD diagnosis were associated with rate of mortality as follows: more than 0 DDDs < 90: HR 1.27, 95% CI (1.17-1.37), P < 0.001; 90 DDDs < 365: HR 0.93, 95% CI (0.84-1.04), P = 0.203; 365 DDDs < 730: HR 0.66, 95% CI (0.55-0.80), P < 0.001; 730 DDDs: HR 0.42, 95% CI (0.31-0.56), P < 0.001. Current antipsychotic treatment exposure increased mortality rate with HR 2.31, 95% CI (2.14-2.49), P < 0.001. Results from the primary analysis are depicted in Fig. 1 . Secondary analyses without current antipsychotic exposure as explanatory variable are shown in Table 1 .\n\nFemale gender (HR 0.71, 95% CI [0.67-0.75], P < 0.001), as well as older age at dementia diagnosis (HR 0.80, 95% CI [0.79-0.80], P < 0.001) decreased rate of mortality.\n\nPrescription of antihypertensive drugs, lipid-lowering drugs, and oral antidiabetics or insulin increased the rate of mortality: HR 2.46, 95% CI [2.27-2.66], P < 0.001.\n\nMortality increased with increasing severity of AD as measured by some of the proxy markers. The number of bed days hospitalized was not associated with mortality rate, with one to nine bed days resulting in a HR of 1.03 95% CI [0.93-1.15], P < 0.551, and more than nine bed days resulting in a HR of 1.13, 95% CI [0.75-1.71], P = 0.554, as compared to never having been admitted. The rate of mortality increased with lower number of outpatient contacts as compared to no outpatient contacts: one to five outpatient contacts resulted in a HR of 1.32, 95% CI (1.24-1.41), P < 0.001; six to ten outpatient contacts: HR 1.18, 95% CI (1.09-1.341), P < 0.001; and more than ten outpatient contacts: HR 0.89, 95% CI (0.81-0.98), P < 0.05. Living in an institution after being diagnosed with dementia increased the mortality rate (HR 1.15, 95% CI [1.05-1.25], P < 0.005).\n\nThe presence of previous or concurrent psychiatric disorders increased the rate of mortality: HR 1.31, 95% CI (1.26-1.36), P < 0.001, as well as the presence of diagnosed somatic diseases: HR 1.25, 95% CI (1.22-1.28), P < 0.001.\n\nA total of 2088 cancer related deaths (4.5% of all deaths) (923 males and 1165 females) were presented in the study population.\n\nIn total, 626 (291 males and 335 females) patients with cancer related deaths had been exposed to antipsychotic medication. The mean age at death in the exposed group was 82.00 years (SD = 6.87), [males 81.51 years (SD = 6.43); females 82.43 years (SD = 7.21)]. Fig. 2 . Secondary analyses without current antipsychotic exposure as explanatory variable are shown in Table 1 .\n\nFemale gender (HR 0.71, 95% CI [0.65-0.77], P < 0.001), as well as older age at dementia diagnosis (HR 0.79, 95% CI [0.78-0.80], P < 0.001) decreased rate of mortality.\n\nPrescription of antihypertensive drugs, lipid-lowering drugs, and oral antidiabetics or insulin decreased the rate of mortality: HR 0.53, 95% CI (0.47-0.59), P < 0.001.\n\nMortality from cancer was associated to some proxy measures of AD severity. The number of bed days hospitalized did not increase the mortality rate, with one to nine bed days resulting in a HR of 0.95, 95% CI (0.78-1.16), P = 0.610, and more than nine bed days resulting in a HR of 0.73, 95% CI (0.30-1.76), P = 0.483, as compared to never having been admitted. The rate of mortality increased with any number of outpatient contacts as compared to no outpatient contacts, with one to five outpatient contacts resulting in a HR of 1.39, 95% CI [1.26-1.55], P < 0.001; six to ten outpatient contacts: HR 1.20, 95% CI (1.04-1.38), P < 0.05; more than ten outpatient contacts: HR 0.65, 95% CI (0.54-0.78), P < 0.001. Living in an institution was not associated to rate of mortality (HR 0.94, 95% CI [0.79-1.12], P = 0.496).\n\nThe presence of previous or concurrent psychiatric disorders increased the rate of mortality: HR 1.32, 95% CI (1.25-1.41), P < 0.001, as well as the presence of diagnosed somatic diseases: HR 1.84, 95% CI (1.78-1.89), P < 0.001.\n\nA total of 1620 infection related deaths (3.5% of all deaths) (743 males and 877 females) were presented in the study population.\n\nAmong these, 647 patients (325 males and 322 females) of this population had been exposed to antipsychotic medication. The mean age at death in the exposed group was 83.79 years (SD = 6.87), [males 82.94 years (SD = 6.86); females 84.65 years (SD = 6.78)]. \n\nRegarding death from infection, we found that cumulative dosages of antipsychotic treatment after diagnosis of AD compared to no exposure were associated to the rate of mortality as follows: Fig. 3 . A secondary analysis without current antipsychotic exposure as explanatory variable is shown in Table 1 .\n\nFemale gender (HR 0.55, 95% CI [0.50-0.61], P < 0.001), as well as older age at dementia diagnosis (HR 0.78, 95% CI [0.77-0.79], P < 0.001) decreased rate of mortality.\n\nPrescription of antihypertensive drugs, lipid-lowering drugs, and oral antidiabetics or insulin decreased the rate of mortality: HR 0.79, 95% CI(0.70-0.90), P < 0.001.\n\nMortality was associated with increasing severity of AD as measured by some of the proxy markers. The number of bed days hospitalized did not increase the mortality rate significantly, with one to nine bed days resulting in a HR of 1.16, 95% CI (0.96-1.41), P = 0.134, as well as more than nine bed days resulting in a HR of 1.47, 95% CI (0.78-2.76), P = 0.230, as compared to never having been admitted. The rate of mortality increased with low number of outpatient contacts as compared to no outpatient contacts, with one to five outpatient contacts resulting in a HR of 1.14, 95% CI (1.01-1.29), P < 0.05; six to ten outpatient contacts: HR 1.06, 95% CI (0.90-1.23), P = 0.493; more than ten outpatient contacts: HR 0.73, 95% CI (0.61-0.88), P < 0.005. Living in an institution increased the mortality rate (HR 1.18, 95% CI [1.01-1.39], P < 0.05).\n\nThe presence of previous or concurrent psychiatric disorders increased the rate of mortality: HR 1.31, 95% CI (1.22-1.40), P < 0.001, as well as the presence of diagnosed somatic diseases: HR 1.54, 95% CI (1.48-1.60), P < 0.001.\n\nTwenty-eight intentional self-harm related deaths (0.06% of all deaths) were presented in the study population, and six patients with intentional self-harm related deaths were exposed to antipsychotic medication. The mean age at death in the exposed group was 71.64 years (SD = 11.28). Following the rules of Statistics Denmark, we do not report gender distribution due to the very low numbers encountered.\n\nRegarding death from intentional self-harm, we did not find that cumulative dosages of antipsychotic treatment after AD diagnosis compared to no exposure were associated to the rate of mortality: more than 0 DDDs < 90: HR 0.56, 95% CI (0.23-2.06), P = 0.383; 90 DDDs < 365: HR 0.16, 95% CI (0.02-1.53), P = 0.111; 730 DDDs: HR 0.49, 95% CI (0.04-6.03), P = 0.576. Current antipsychotic treatment exposure did not increase the mortality rate significantly (HR 1.92, 95% CI [0.59-6.28], P = 0.279) as compared to no exposure. Results from the primary analysis are depicted in Fig. 4 . The secondary analysis without current antipsychotic exposure as explanatory variable is shown in Table 1 .\n\nPrescription of antihypertensive drugs, lipid-lowering drugs, and oral antidiabetics or insulin was not associated to rate of mortality: HR 1.93, 95% CI (0.72-5.22), P = 0.193.\n\nOne to nine bed days resulted in a HR of 2.65, 95% CI (0.78-9.01) P = 0.120, and more than nine bed days resulted in a HR of 10.42, 95% CI (1.10-98.35), P < 0.05, as compared to not being admitted. The rate of mortality was not increased with any number of outpatient contacts as compared to no outpatient contacts, with one to five outpatient contacts resulting in a HR of 1.50, 95% CI (0.58-3.87), P = 0.405; six to ten outpatient contacts: HR 1.71, 95% CI (0.54-5.37), P = 0.484; more than ten outpatient contacts: HR 0.54, 95% CI (0.10-3.01), P = 0.484. Likewise, living in an institution was not associated with a higher mortality rate (HR 1.11, 95% CI [0. .89], P = 0.893).\n\nThe presence of previous or concurrent psychiatric disorders increased the rate of mortality: HR 2.92, 95% CI [2.01-4.24], P < 0.001, while the presence of diagnosed somatic diseases did not: HR 0.90, 95% CI (0.66-1.24), P = 0.528.\n\nThe current study allowed us to investigate the effects of antipsychotic exposure in a nationwide population, including all newly diagnosed with AD where clinicians were able to treat the individual patient as they judged to be optimal. In this population, we confirmed the results from previous randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and meta-analyses that have shown an increased risk of death associated with current exposure to antipsychotic treatment [7, [11] [12] [13] . The finding is consistent and significant for all investigated causes of death -except intentional self-harm -, which could suggest that current antipsychotic exposure affects mortality similarly on all investigated causes of death, or could also suggest that current antipsychotic exposure is a marker of severity of illness (Table 2 ).\n\nIn the analyses of cumulative antipsychotic dosages after AD diagnosis, we initially included current exposure as an explanatory variable, showing that the lowest cumulative antipsychotic dosage increased rate of mortality, whereas the higher dosages decreased rate of mortality for most causes of death. No patients currently exposed would be in the baseline cumulative dosage group with zero DDDs, causing current exposure and cumulative drug dosage groups to be associated. When conducting the analyses without current exposure as an explanatory variable, we showed higher cumulative drug dosages being associated with an increased mortality rate for infection and cardiovascular related deaths. We believe the divergent findings are a result of a collider bias, which could have led to false conclusions, had the secondary analyses without current exposure as explanatory variable not been conducted. The findings of increased mortality rate associated with cumulative dosages of antipsychotic drugs for cardiovascular and infection related deaths are in line with results from other studies [2, 3] . In our study, cancer related deaths are not associated with higher cumulative dosages of antipsychotic drug treatment. This finding is reassuring, although previous studies have proposed antipsychotics as carcinogenic [14, 15] . As opposed to the other disorders investigated, our study population is selected given that they are generally older and have not yet died from a cancer related illness. Studies have suggested cancer to be less common in patients diagnosed with AD [4] , perhaps resulting in the lack of association between cumulative antipsychotic dosages and mortality related to cancer. Secondly, the possible effects of antipsychotics on the risk of developing cancer would most likely not be dramatic, and time from exposure to a possible cancer related death could be long, resulting in some patients dying from other causes. This would be opposed to the effects of antipsychotic drugs on cardiovascular related deaths, where time from exposure to effects is shorter, as shown in studies on patients with dementia, as well as other psychiatric disorders [8, 16] . The specific background for the increased occurrence of cardiovascular events are unknown, but antipsychotic drugs are known to increase the risk of hypotension, increase blood lipids, as well as increase the risk of lowered insulin sensitivity or even diabetes, all being associated with an increase in cardiovascular events longer term [17, 18] .\n\nWhen reviewing both statistical models (with and without current exposure), we see a trend towards an inverse relationship between antipsychotic cumulative dosage and mortality. This finding is likely caused by a survival bias, in which survivors of treatment are being exposed for a longer period, and thereby are able to receive higher dosages of medication. An alternative interpretation could be that clinicians are able to determine which patients benefit from antipsychotic treatment and continue treatment in patients where the risk-benefit ratio is positive. Several short-term randomized controlled trials have been conducted on the effects of antipsychotics on aggression and psychosis in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, predominantly showing decreased levels of symptoms after treatment [19] . An explanation for our results could be that in patients with severe BPSD, where antipsychotic drugs are efficacious, the increased mortality rate of current antipsychotic exposure could be partly balanced by a lowered mortality rate caused by the lowered level of BPSD. No previous studies have investigated the effects of cumulative dosages of antipsychotic drug on specific cause mortality in AD, but findings of decreased mortality appear in studies of schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorders where the effects of cumulative drug dosages have been investigated [20, 21] .\n\nWe show that psychiatric co-morbidities increase the rate of mortality in all investigated causes of death, including intentional self-harm, when controlling for remaining variables. The finding is similar to smaller studies showing an increased mortality associated with some psychiatric co-morbidities, on suicide, as we do, but also on all-cause mortality [22, 23] . In a parallel manner, we show that a known somatic disease increases the rate of mortality in all investigated causes of death, except for intentional self-harm, to some degree supporting the face-validity of our statistical model.\n\nLastly, we show that older age at diagnosis as well as female gender decreases rate of mortality in the investigated causes of death. These findings are most likely caused by age at diagnosis being a prognostic factor for severity of dementia [24] , whereas the latter finding could be explained by females generally living longer, as compared to males, in the Danish population [25] .\n\nThe most important limitation of the study is the lack of randomization, which increases the risk of systematic biases between the exposed and non-exposed groups. Although we added explanatory variables to minimize the bias from psychiatric and somatic co-morbidities, as well as severity of the disorder, there are unmeasured differences between the exposed and unexposed groups that may have affected the results.\n\nDespite these limitations, the main strengths of the study are the long follow-up time and the inclusion of all eligible patients in a nationwide sample where the current data are systematically gathered and patients are not lost to follow-up.\n\nIn conclusion, we found that lifetime cumulative antipsychotic drug dosages as compared to no exposure are associated with increased mortality rates in cardiovascular and infection related deaths, especially for lower cumulative dosages. We also showed an inverse dose to mortality relationship, with the highest investigated cumulative drug dosage not being associated with or decreasing rate of mortality. These findings confirm the established concern about the use of antipsychotic drugs in patients diagnosed with AD, but also highlight the need for further investigations of long-term effects of treatment, and possible subgroups who could benefit from treatment.\n\nThe study has been funded by the affiliated research institutions, as well as a grant from the Psychiatric Research Fund of North Jutland.
