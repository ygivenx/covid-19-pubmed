{"title": "Visualizing Clinical Evidence: Citation Networks for the Incubation\nPeriods of Respiratory Viral Infections", "body": "Repeated scientific and medical facts often gain a currency that far exceeds that\nwhich is warranted by the evidence that supports them. A classic example is the\noften-repeated recommendation that we need to drink at least eight glasses of water\na day. While widely accepted as fact for years, a review of the literature showed\nthat this recommendation was not supported by any particular piece of scientific\nevidence [1]. In\nthis manuscript, we present visualizations of citation networks for particular\nmedical facts, the incubation periods of respiratory viral infections. Citation\nnetworks are an informative way to visualize the scientific history and\ndissemination of specific scientific facts.\n\nThe incubation period, the time between infection with a pathogen and the onset of\nsymptoms, is an important natural history parameter of disease. Estimates of the\nfull distribution of the incubation period for a disease can provide practical\nguidance to clinicians or policy-makers in a variety of settings. For example, the\nincubation period may be used when determining the source of illness [2], [3] or when setting\nsocial-distancing measures such as quarantine or school-closure in an infectious\ndisease outbreak setting [4], [5]. However, finding precise data on incubation periods is\ndifficult because the events that define an incubation period \u2014 infection and\nsymptom onset \u2014 may themselves be hard to observe.\n\nBecause of the challenges with collecting complete incubation period data, statements\nof the incubation period based on no empirical data or anecdotal data are common.\nUntil recently, this was the state of the knowledge of the incubation periods for\nmost common respiratory viral pathogens. To address this gap in the scientific\nliterature, we published a systematic review of the incubation period of nine common\nrespiratory viral infections [6]. This review provided evidence-based estimates of the full\nincubation period distribution for each of these diseases, incorporating data from\nprimary sources identified through the review. In the process of reviewing 556\narticles, we constructed networks that represent the history and development of\nknowledge about the incubation period for these diseases. The full bibliography is\navailable in References S1.\n\nThis paper presents citation networks created from the literature review's\ncitation data. While the trees are interesting themselves from a data visualization\nperspective, they also give insight into how scientific knowledge of particular\nmedical facts evolve over time.\n\nA systematic literature review, described in Lessler et al. [6], was performed to identify\nstatements of incubation period and sources of original incubation period data for\nthe following respiratory viral infections: adenovirus, human coronavirus (HCoV),\nSARS-associated coronavirus, influenza A and B, measles virus, human\nmetapneumovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus.\nAll citations for a given statement were followed to identify the original source of\nthe estimate. For each statement, all citations were recorded. These citations, an\ninstance of one source citing another, make up the branches of the citation trees;\nthe statements and sources are the nodes. Sources that provided no citation and were\nnot themselves cited by another source were only included in the networks if they\ncontained original data.\n\nA spreadsheet was used to create a record of all statements of incubation period,\nwhether a citation was provided or not, and all sources of data. A version of this\nspreadsheet is available in Data S1. This information was used to create the\ngraphs, by hand, using Adobe Illustrator.\n\nTo visually clarify the presented citations, we incorporated a few design elements.\nEach citation is designated by two lines of text and an \u201cincubation period\nclock\u201d. The clocks encode the incubation period estimate visually, allowing\nreaders to quickly grasp how the estimates change (or not) over time. Arrows\nindicate a precise statement (median or mean) of the incubation period while shaded\nblue areas indicate given ranges or confidence intervals. The top line of text\nsuccinctly summarizes the stated estimate from that source, using \u201ch\u201d\nand \u201cd\u201d as abbreviations for \u201chours\u201d and \u201cdays\u201d,\nrespectively. An asterisk indicates that the source did not provide a stated\nincubation period, but was included because it did provide original data that could\nbe used to estimate the incubation period. Citations shown in red or orange text are\nthose with original data and those in black are sources that do not contain original\ndata. Also on the first line, the abbreviation \u201cObs\u201d or\n\u201cExp\u201d appears, indicating whether the study was observational (in orange\ntext) or experimental (in red). The second line of text gives the last name of the\nfirst author and the year in which the source was first published. The weight or\nstroke of the arrow lines pointing to a given source corresponds to the cumulative\nnumber of citations that rely on that source for information. We used lightly shaded\ngray boxes to group multiple editions of the same source and multiple publications\nfrom the same study (for example, yearly CDC influenza reports). In the case of\ninfluenza the time scale is log transformed (with 1890 as year 1) to accommodate the\ngreater frequency of citations in later years. In all other cases the time axis\nfollows a linear scale.\n\nAll citation trees were created as described above except for the case of SARS. The\nliterature on SARS had markedly different characteristics from the other diseases.\nThere is a dense and highly-connected citation network for SARS which developed over\nthe course of the few years after the 2002 SARS outbreak. Different methods were\nrequired to create this citation network and it is available as Figure S1 for\ncomparison purposes.\n\nAdditionally, metrics that characterize the connectedness of each network were\ncomputed to provide additional insight into the structure of the networks and direct\ncomparisons between diseases. Based on the methods of Kleinberg [7], hub and authority\nscores were computed. Hub and authority scores are values between 0 and 1, computed\nso that the vector norm of each set of scores is equal to 1. A high hub score value\nfor a particular source indicates that the given paper provides links to many strong\nauthorities on the topic. A high authority score for a particular source indicates\nthat the given paper is cited by many other sources. The results of these\ncalculations and a complete description of the metrics calculated are given in Appendix\nS1.\n\n\nFigure 1 captures a long\nhistory of incubation period data collection for both influenza A and B.\nHowever, as the citation network shows, only 6 of 28 (21.4%) of the\noriginal sources of data have contributed to the conventional scientific wisdom\nabout influenza. Cox and Subbarao's claim (in 1999) that the incubation\nperiod of influenza is \u201c1\u20134 days\u201d is the single most cited\nstatement of the incubation period of influenza [8]. Cox and Subbarao in turn\ncite the Moser (1979) analysis of exposure and onset times for 37 influenza\ncases as an example of \u201ca single infected person [transmitting]\nthe virus to a large number of susceptible individuals.\u201d While this is the\nonly possible source given by the authors for the incubation period itself, it\nis unclear to what extent they relied on the results in Moser et al. to inform\ntheir statement of this fact. The longest observed incubation period reported by\nMoser et al. was 72 hours [9]. Over 150 other usable observations on the incubation\nperiod, across 6 papers, are not cited at all as sources for influenza\nincubation period data.\n\nThe example of adenovirus shows that the cited incubation period estimates in\nsome cases are not based on experimental data at all. Neither of the two\noriginal sources of data are used to inform stated estimates of the incubation\nperiod (see Figure 2).\n\nOne of two original sources of data for the incubation period for HCoV is used by\nsubsequent authors. While one experimental study is overlooked, Figure 2 shows that the other\nsource clearly has become the canonical source of incubation period data for\nHCoV. However, the interpretations of the used data are inconsistent. One of the\nciting sources claims the incubation period is 3\u20135 days, another 2\u20134\ndays and two sources identify 2 days as the incubation period. All of these\nreduce the information contained in the original estimate, which provides a mean\nas well as a range.\n\nBoth original sources of data on the incubation period of human metapneumovirus\nare cited by subsequent authors. With just four sources on the citation network\nfor human metapneumovirus (shown in Figure 2), the original sources are identified and interpreted\ncorrectly by subsequent authors.\n\nFour of six sources of original incubation period data for parainfluenza are\ncited by outside sources (see Figure 2). As with Rhinovirus, there are more sources of original\ndata than there are referencing articles.\n\nOnly three of the nine original sources providing incubation period data on\nrhinovirus are used by subsequent authors, as is seen in Figure 2. Several of the more recent studies,\npublished in 2000, have not been incorporated into the accepted literature.\n\nAs Figure 3 shows, five of\nsix original data sources on the incubation period of respiratory syncytial\nvirus are used by subsequent authors. The single paper that is not cited\n(Tyrell, 1993) provides data on RSV, rhinovirus and HCoV but is not cited\nsubsequently in literature for any of these diseases. The RSV citations are\nfairly centralized around several key primary and secondary sources, although\nthere are a few stray references that cannot be traced back to an original data\nsource.\n\nOnly four of 16 original sources of information on the incubation period of\nmeasles are cited, although five of those have been published since 2001. While\nthis shows that the measles citation network does not use the available\ninformation as efficiently, Figure\n4 reveals similar patterns to the citation network for RSV. Several\nkey primary sources serve as hubs in the citation network, while a few\nreferences cannot be traced back to original data.\n\n\nResults from our quantitative analysis of\nthe networks are available in Appendix S1.\n\nInfluenza and human coronavirus are the two diseases with high maximum authority\nscores (0.99 and 1.00, respectively). These reflect the fact that the prevailing\nwisdom about the incubation period for these two diseases relies highly on a\nsingle source. No other disease has a maximum authority score above 0.75.\nMeasles has the lowest maximum authority score (0.46), indicating that no one\nsource dominates the citation network.\n\nAdenovirus and measles have the two highest maximum hub scores (1.00 and 0.95\nrespectively). Influenza has the lowest maximum hub score (0.29). Maximum hub\nscores vary widely across diseases. However we observed that sources with high\nhub scores are often not highly cited. Hence, in the absence of a widely cited\nreview, it is unclear how the presence of a paper with a high hub score\ninfluences the evolution of knowledge about the incubation period of a\nparticular disease. For example, Oxman (2002) cites six papers in stating an\nestimate for the incubation period of measles, however, as of the time when the\nreview was conducted, this paper had only been cited once.\n\nThe incubation period is commonly used to identify nosocomial infections and to\npinpoint the origin of a single-source outbreak. The use of faulty data in these\ncontexts can lead to inappropriate conclusions. For instance, if a clinician relied\nupon the incubation period listed in the 2004 edition of the Textbook of\nPediatric Infectious Diseases for RSV (between 4 and 8 days) they would\nfalsely conclude that a patient who developed symptoms after 3 days in a hospital\nhad no chance of being nosocomially infected. However our best estimates for the\nincubation period of RSV indicates that 1 out of 3 patients with RSV will have\nincubation periods less than 4 days [6].\n\nFor all of the diseases presented here, we reveal that the conventional wisdom about\nthe incubation period is often not based on much actual experimental data. Overall\n(excluding SARS), 35% (25/71) of original sources for incubation period data\nwere cited by subsequent publications and 50% of all incubation period\nstatements did not provide a source for their estimate [6]. For all diseases except for\nhuman metapneumovirus there was at least one study with original data that was not\ncited by any of the subsequent papers. These types of summary measures, a\nqualitative sense of which can be gleaned from a quick look at the networks\nthemselves, are helpful in evaluating the need for further work in a given area.\n\nSocial factors may influence downstream citation patterns. For example, papers\nwritten by well-known authors or in high-impact journals may have a wider and faster\ncirculation than others. Also, the accessibility of the publication (i.e.\nsubscription required or available for free online) may also have an impact on how\nwidely a particular publication is read and cited. Comprehensive reviews should\nensure that all sources of data are brought to light, and help provide equal footing\nfor publications that might otherwise receive less attention.\n\nIt is important to note that a complete systematic review requires more than just\nevaluating the use or disuse of available data. A full review of an area of\nknowledge requires a detailed examination of data sources and their ability to\nanswer the question of interest. While striving to create an authoritative source on\na particular topic, reviewers must strike a balance between quality and diversity of\ndata. Including all data (regardless of quality) can lead to biased or highly\nvariable estimates because of differing procedures for measuring data like possible\nexposures or time of onset. However, leaving out particular datasets because of\nperceived poor quality could lead to a more homogenous dataset that ignores\nvariation due to characteristics that may change drastically from one dataset to\nanother, like population demographics or different strains of a disease. Given all\nof these potential complications, a systematic review process, such as those\nrecommended by the Cochrane Collaboration, is vital to conducting standardized,\nreproducible research [10].\n\nUsing enhanced data visualization techniques to display literature review data can\nreveal historical citation patterns and help communicate the results quickly and\nintuitively to a wide audience. The visualization process can be rewarding, but it\nis also a time-consuming and challenging task to create accurate, detailed and\nvisually pleasing figures. Once created, however, such visual displays of citation\nhistories can be very valuable for learning about the history and development of a\nparticular field of research.\n\nResearch and development of software that could automate the process of creating (and\neasily updating) customized citation networks would be a welcome addition to the\nfield of data visualization and any scientific realm in which comprehensive\nliterature reviews are conducted. If it were standard practice to maintain such\n\u201cevidential trees\u201d for scientific and medical facts it would be easier\nto assess the weight which these facts should actually be given in practice and to\ndetermine when systematic reviews are necessary."}
