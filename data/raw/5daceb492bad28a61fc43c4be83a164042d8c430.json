Samples were imaged using 307 a confocal setup (Zeiss Airyscan equipped with a 63x, NA=1.3 objective), and the 308 images were processed using ZEN lite software. 309 11 nuclease-free Dulbecco's phosphate saline buffer (DPBS) for 10 min at room 313 temperature. Samples were washed twice with DPBS, and then permeabilized 314 with 70% (v/v) ethanol in RNAse-free water at +4 o C for at least 1 hour prior to 315 hybridization. Permeabilized samples were re-hydrated for 5 min in a pre-316 hybridization buffer (300 mM NaCl, 30 mM trisodium citrate, pH 7.0 in nuclease-317 free water, 10 % v/v formamide, supplemented with 2 mM vanadyl ribonucleoside 318 complex). Re-hydrated samples were hybridized with 62.5 nM of an equimolar 319 mixture of Cy3-labelled DNA probes designed to target the coding region of the 320 gene segment 6 of simian rotavirus A/SA11 (Genbank Acc. AY187029.1) using 321 Here we provide direct demonstration of the role of NSP5 in RV replication, using 408 an NSP5 knock out rRV (termed rRV-NSP5/KO) generated by reverse genetics. 409\n\nTo rescue the NSP5/KO strain, a stop codon at position 18Y was introduced ( complementing MA-NSP5 cell line (Fig. 2C ). Together, these data confirm that 420 NSP5 is essential for RV replication. 421 422 rRVs with impaired NSP5 phosphorylation 423\n\nTo address the role of NSP5 hyperphosphorylation, we then generated a number 424 of rRVs harbouring NSP5 mutations previously known to impact NSP5 425 phosphorylation. We first generated an rRV carrying an S67A mutation (rRV-426 NSP5/S67A) ( Table 1 and The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

NSP2-mCherry and NSP5-EGFP fusion proteins were also 466 recruited to both types of these structures (Fig. 5C) , suggesting that the observed 467 lack of phosphorylation does not affect NSP2/NSP5 interactions. Furthermore, 468 the NSP5/S67A mutant and additional viroplasmic proteins NSP2, VP6 and VP2 469 with rRV-NSP5/S67A mutant (Fig. 7A, left panel) . Furthermore, the observed 522 immature viroplasms also appeared to be less-electron dense, likely due to their 523 .

This step does not take 533 place when NSP5 is expressed alone; iii) hyper-phosphorylation of NSP5 534 triggered by Ser67 phosphorylation that requires the 18 AA long C-terminal tail 535 (24). 536\n\nHere, we have investigated the phosphorylation mechanism of NSP5 during RV 537 infection using a number of NSP5 phosphorylation-negative rRV strains and 538 MA104-derived stable transfectant cell lines (Table 1) . We demonstrated that 539 despite the presence of Ser67, deletion mutant NSP5/\uf044T was not phosphorylated 540 and failed to form viroplasms. We have previously shown that co-expression of 541 NSP5/\uf044T was also unable to trigger the phosphorylation cascade of NSP5/S67A, 542 while other NSP5 mutants referred hereafter as activators of phosphorylation, 543 e.g., NSP5/\uf0443 did (24). Interestingly, upon co-infection with two rRVs 544 NSP5/S67A and NSP5/\uf044T, both mutated NSP5 variants were not phosphorylated 545 (Table 1 and Fig. 8B, lanes 3-4) . The NSP5-\uf044176-180 mutant 548 was also unable to induce phosphorylation of NSP5/S67A following the co-549 infection with the two rRVs, despite both containing Ser67 and the C-terminal tail. 550\n\nThis result suggests that the 'activator' NSP5 needs to be also hyper-551 phosphorylated (Fig. 8C) . replicate and also showed spherical structures that contained NSP5 and NSP2, 582 but not VP6 (Fig. 10A-C) . Of the two non-structural proteins involved in viroplasm assembly, NSP5 appears 601 to play a crucial role by potentially providing a scaffold that allows for recruitment 602 of additional viral proteins. Only when NSP5 is co-expressed with NSP2 and/or 603 VP2, these proteins assemble into the viroplasm-like structures (VLS), which are 604 also capable to recruit additional structural proteins including VP1, VP2 and VP6 605 (8, 10). Given these observations, we hypothesised that complete removal of 606 NSP5 would be lethal for RV replication. Using a modified reverse genetics Using the NSP5 mutant strains described above and the established stable 673 transfectant MA104 cells we were able to investigate the molecular mechanism 674 that leads to NSP5 hyperphosphorylation. We showed that the NSP5/S67A 675 mutant from the rRV was indeed hyperphosphorylated, albeit not completely, 676 .
