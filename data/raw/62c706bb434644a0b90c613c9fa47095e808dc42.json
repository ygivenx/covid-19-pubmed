{"title": "Composite nonwovens in fi lters: applications", "body": "The developmental objectives of composite fi ltering media are lower energy consumption, longer fi lter life, high fi ltration capacity, greater dust holding (in depth fi ltration) and easy cleanability (of surface fi lter), satisfying more than one functional requirement and easier maintenance. Composite structures are usually multilayered fi lter media, each layer serving a specifi c purpose in the fi ltration/ separation process. All the layers of a composite are not necessarily nonwovens. One or more of the layers could be a membrane material, a woven material, or a plastic or metal mesh material to provide structural support. Further, there are two contrasting styles of laminated structure, depending on whether the fi lter medium is intended to function by depth fi ltration or by surface fi ltration. With depth fi ltration, the medium should be graded so as to increase the fi neness of fi bers in the direction of fl ow. The upper, coarser layers will act as a prefi lter, in which the larger particles are retained, with the smaller particles then being trapped subsequently in the fi ner layers. This will maximize the dirt holding capacity per unit area of medium, and hence its life before it is discarded. In the case of surface fi ltration, material consisting of fi ner pores/larger surface area should be at the upstream side, so that it can be cleaned intermittently for regeneration purpose.\n\nIn composite nonwovens, the structures usually serve one, or a combination of, the following purposes:\n\n\u2022 Provide mechanical support for other structural or fi ltering layers, giving enhanced durability.\n\n\u2022 Provide two or more layers of different fi ltration effi ciency. \u2022 Facilitating the combination of varied separation functions or technologies into a single fi lter medium.\n\n\u2022 The outer layers serve as a containment to inhibit medium migration, dusting, and particle fallout from the inner layers.\n\nIn many situations, composite nonwovens might fulfi ll multiple objectives. For example, spunbond nonwoven can act as support layers for fi lter media (such as activated carbon, meltblown and nanofi ber webs, microfi ber glass and cellulose) as well as protection layer. Spunbond nonwovens in the higher weight range are used as fi lter medium for coarse fi ltration, and as a prefi lter for fi ner fi lter media. Figure 8 .1 shows that in many cases the composite fi lter media can satisfy multiple objectives such as particulate fi ltration (by nonwoven layer), absorption of gases (by carbon layer), and providing dimensional stability and strength to the media (by polypropylene grid).\n\nFurther, composite material may fulfi ll some other requirements not listed above. For example, the spunbond nonwoven can fulfi ll requirements other than support layer in pleated fi lter media for cabin air fi lters. It leads to stiffer and sharper (smaller radius of curvature) pleats, without losing overall mechanical properties, thus allowing a more effi cient fi lter design (Maltha, 2011 ).\n\nThe role of composite nonwovens in fi lters: combining mechanical support and durability with fi ltration In many cases, the role of a component in a composite is to provide mechanical support and durability of the fi ltration layer. For illustration, although fi ltration capability by electrospun nanofi bers and meltblown nonwovens is very high, they tend to be fairly weak and are generally too thin. The mechanical strength of nanofi brous layer/meltblown nonwovens are not suffi cient to withstand macroscopic impact during fi ltration applications such as normal liquid or air fl ow passing through them. Stronger materials are therefore required for such applications, and materials which have been demonstrated to offer suitable mechanical strength include woven fabric, spunbond, spunlace (hydroentanged), needlepunch felt, or cellulose web. Figure 8 .2 shows the cross-section of hydroentangled composite with meltblown layer for industrial application.\n\nFiber fi neness is considered as one of the most important parameters while selecting/designing the fi lter media. Very fi ne fi bers can be made from meltblown, bi-component and electro-spinning techniques. Nanofi ber fabric possess extremely high surface to weight ratio from small fi ber diameters (10-100 times smaller than those of meltblown and spunbond fi laments), interconnected pore structure, very small pore size and potential for functional modifi cation of the fi ber surface, thus offering more possibilities for a wide range of applications, 8.2 Cross-section of a hydroentangled composite with a meltblown layer (HYCOFIL \u00ae ) (used with permission from S\u00e4chsisches Textilforschungsinstitut e.V. (STFI), Chemnitz, Germany).\n\nranging from air cleaning for automotive to environment conditioning or liquid fi ltration (Yoon et al. , 2006; Barhate and Ramakrishna, 2007; Dotti et al. , 2007) . In all these applications, fi ner fi ber materials need to be supported by a stronger component in composite. There is another perspective of the use of thin layers of fi ner fi bers. The media made out of fi ner fi ber lead to higher fi ltration effi ciency at the cost of higher pressure differential across the fabric. For a suitable balance between effi ciency and levels of pressure, use of a thin layer of fi ner fi ber component in a composite is required. The fi ner fi ber layer can be positioned upstream before the macro fi ltration substrate to enhance surface fi ltration performance or downstream of the macro fi ltration substrate to improve depth fi ltration in order to capture particles within the body of the media. Finer media at the upstream side of surface fi lters lead to better cake dislodgement and prevention of particle penetration inside fi lter media (Kothari et al. , 1993; Ciach and Gradon, 1998; Call\u00e9 et al. , 2002) , which in turn results in better long term performance of fi lter media. However, a thin layer of nanofi bers on meltblown media has a weak bond and higher production costs (Lydall Filtration and Separation, 2013) . The weak bond is a problem in the nanofi ber layer in self-cleaning or pulse cleaning fi lter applications. The dust cake formed on the upstream side of the fi lter media can be removed by back-pulsing air through the media to rejuvenate it. As a great force is exerted on the surface during the back-pulse, nanofi bers with poor adhesion to substrates, or comprised of delicate nanofi bers, can delaminate when the shock wave moves from the interior of the fi lter through the substrate to the nanofi ber. However, the new nanofi ber technology was reported to provide excellent adhesion to the substrate, enabling longer life and improved effi ciencies in pulse-cleaning applications because of greater particle collection and overall energy expended during the cleaning process. The plurality of nanofi ber layers also provides superior durability (Wertz and Schneiders, 2009) .\n\nStudies have demonstrated that high effi ciency composite fi lters made up of nano-and microfi bers, when added to industrial gas fi ltration systems (such as dust-collecting pulse-clean cartridges) extend fi lter life (Kosminder and Scott, 2002) . Researchers have also developed an industrial gas fi lter medium consisting of 70% polymers with a regular melting temperature and 30% polymers with a low melting temperature. This medium employs polyester felts as the base material for the polymer mix, with a prepared polyamide nano-sized web at the upstream side of the fabric (Yeo et al. , 2007) . A thermal roller was employed to bond the overlapped fi lter medium. Subsequent work to evaluate fi ltration capability revealed greater collection effi ciency and more stable fi ltration behavior in the medium with the nano-sized web showing more stable fi ltration behavior and improved collection effi ciency. The levels of dust found to be left in fabric containing nanofi ber web was also revealed to be far lower than those in fabric with no nanofi ber web (Yeo et al. , 2007) . One patent disclosure suggested that high fi ltration effi ciency could be achieved by enhancing the upstream surface of a spunbonded medium via use of a micro-or nanofi ber structure on the upstream surface (Chung et al. , 2008) .\n\nMost often the combination of structure is made by heat bonding the process either by purely heating the process or by using hot melt adhesive. Combination is also possible by ultrasonic welding. Hydro-entanglement and needlepunching are also interesting options for the joining together of two layers to produce composite fi ltration materials. In one study, the needlepunching technique was used as the initial step in preparing P84 needlefelt. P84 needlefelt was then prepared by taking the upstream side of felt, constructed of standard 2.2 dtexfi ber, and adding 1.0 dtexmicrofi ber. This produces a medium capable of increasing gas fi ltration effi ciency by preventing deep dust penetration, maintaining stable pressure drop, and facilitating good bag life. As well as being an effective fi ltration medium in gas fi ltration systems, P84 fi bers can additionally be used as either a PTFE (polytetrafl uoroethylene) fi ber blending partner, or in the construction of surface layers on homopolymer acrylic, polyester or m -aramide felts (Connor, 1997) . Varied combinations of medium have been tested in layered construction, leading to the formation of such composites as a felt-like layered construction of PTFE and glass paper (Fagan, 1982) .\n\nIn the case of depth fi ltration, use of nanofi ber was also reported. Finer media trap tiny particles of the order of <0.5 mm at the fi nal stage and therefore it is possible to achieve HEPA (high effi ciency particulate air) grade regarding collection effi ciency (Kattamuri et al. , 2005; Ahn et al. , 2006; Podgorski et al. , 2006; Yun et al. , 2007; Wang et al. , 2008a Wang et al. , , 2008b . Problems of structural damage and delamination in depth fi ltration applications can be largely overcome by suitable composite development. In the combination of meltblown (M) and spunlaid (S) nonwovens (SMS, SMMS or SSMMS), the spunlaid component provides the required strength and abrasion properties and the meltblown component act as a barrier for liquids or particles. For the aforesaid reason, a major portion of meltblown material is used in composite form (Hutten, 2007) . Figure 8 .3 shows the cross-sectional view of an SMS fabric.\n\nIn a nanofi ber composite, fi lter media were made where lighter layers of nanofi bers were applied to the spunbond materials, then two layers of spunbond/ nanofi ber composite were laminated together in a face-to-face confi guration, i.e. a structure of spunbond-nanofi ber-lamination-nanofi ber-spunbond.\n\nThe outer layers protect the nanofi ber layer from abrasion and other mechanical damage, and therefore would also prevent the nanofi ber layer from scuffi ng (Graham et al. , 2003) . The material can be used for depth fi ltration situations in non-cleanable fi lters. A triple layer design of fi brous fi lters was reported (Podgorski et al. , 2006) wherein the middle nanofi brous layer was placed between the back support layer of densely packed microfi bers and the front porous layer of fi bers of a few micrometer diameter. The composite was found to be useful to remove the nanoparticles along with other polydispersed aerosol particles.\n\nComposites with nanofi ber layers fi nd applications in many critical areas such as medical, hygiene, bioseparation, etc. (Gopal et al. , 2006; Barhate and Ramakrishna, 2007) . It was observed that an electrospun membrane conveniently rejected the microparticles and acted as a screen fi lter without fouling the membrane especially when the particles were larger than the largest pore size of the nanofi brous membrane (Gopal et al. , 2007) . Nanofi brous fi ltering media can be used where high-performance air purifi cation is needed such as in hospitals, healthcare facilities, research labs, electronic component manufacturers, military and government agencies, food, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The medium is very effi cient for fi ltration of blood, water, air, beverages, gases, chemicals, oils, diesel and petrol, etc. Manufacturing and processing companies in food, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and the semiconductor business require centralized air conditioning in the production environment, high purity water, clean gases and effl uent/waste air and water treatment. Control over airborne and waterborne contaminants, hazardous biological agents, allergens and pollutants is a key issue in food, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology processes. Under these circumstances, nanofi ber-based fi ltering media are very useful (Barhatea and Ramakrishna, 2007) . Nanofi bers offer enhanced fi ltration performance in both mobile and stationary engines and industrial fi ltration applications wherein the nanofi ber layer is used at the upstream side of the fi lter media.\n\nWith respect to engines, gas turbines and combustion furnaces, it is important to remove particulate material from the air stream supply that can cause substantial damage to the internal components. In other instances, production gases or off-gases from combustion engines and industrial processes may contain 8.3 Hydroentangled composite HYCOSPUN \u00ae spunbond nonwoven with a meltblown fi ne fi ber inside layer (used with permission from S\u00e4chsisches Textilforschungsinstitut e.V. (STFI), Chemnitz, Germany).\n\ndamaging particulate material. The removal of these particulates is desirable to protect downstream equipment and minimize pollution discharge to the environment.\n\nRecently, there was an attempt to functionalize the surface of fi ltering media with antimicrobial agents for long-lasting durable antimicrobial functionality (Lala et al. , 2007) . An antimicrobial nanofi brous fi lter (Tobler and Warner, 2005; Jeong et al. , 2007) was found to be useful for improved antimicrobial functionality in HVAC (heat, ventilation, air conditioning) application. In a medial application, water resistant but water permeable coating of chitosan (antimicrobial) was applied over the polyacrylonitrile nanofi brous layer which was supported on the nonwoven microfi brous substrate (meltblown polyethylene terephthalate mat). This three-tier approach is useful for fl ux and low fouling ultra fi ltration (Yoon et al. , 2006) . High surface-to-volume ratio of nanofi brous media enhances the fouling. Therefore, surface modifi cation of nanofi brous screen fi lter with suitable hydrophilic or hydrophobic oligomer is often recommended to reduce the fouling effect.\n\nApplying a highly water and oil repellent nano-coating has shown to improve the performance of fi ltration products. By providing high liquid protection without compromising air fl ow, considerable performance improvements can be seen across a wide number of fi ltration products (Coulson and Evans, 2011) . Through surface treatment, it is possible to achieve a high conductivity of the media. This allows putting these fi lters into hazardous applications even with an explosive gas atmosphere (Stoffel, 2011) . Nanofi bers do have potential as prefi lters for particulate removal in various applications such as removal of micro-particles from waste-water, prior to ultrafi ltration or nanofi ltration membranes, to prolong the life of these membranes (Gopal et al. , 2006) .\n\nSince a fi brous fi lter medium with a large contact area per unit mass is expected to perform better in promoting coalescence, addition of polystyrene nanofi bers to the coalescence fi lters (glass fi bers) improves the performance of coalescence fi lters. The fi ltration experiments showed that the addition of a small amount of polystyrene nanofi bers signifi cantly improved the coalescence effi ciency of the fi lter but also signifi cantly increased the pressure drop of the fi lters (Shin et al. , 2005a) . There is an optimum amount of nanofi bers to be added to the coalescence fi lter media (Shin et al. , 2005b) , which balances the desired improvement in coalescence effi ciency and the undesirable increase in the pressure drop. Catalytic fi lters, adsorptive fi ltration and absorptive fi lters for highly selective separations (Gibson et al. , 2001; Zuwei et al. , 2005 Zuwei et al. , , 2006 ; Barhate and Ramakrishna, 2007) are also effective at nanoscale.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that manufacturing of nanofi bers at commercial and economical scale has not yet been fully realized. The equipment required for nano technology manufacturing is rather expensive resulting in more expensive fi lter media. Nevertheless, nano technology-based fi lter media is catching on and will likely replace conventional fi lter media in near future. There is also growing interest on bi-component fi bers, which have a higher number of island fi bers. With this island-in-the-sea formation, 1200 fi ne island fi bers can be produced. Apart from the island-in-the-sea technology, the segmented pie technology also helps in producing fi ne fi bers and has become more popular in recent years.\n\nIn industrial pulse-jet fi ltration, scrim reinforced needlefelts are used for improving dimensional stability and greater durability. Figure 8 .4 shows the sectional view of a hydroentangled composite nonwoven with scrim used for the industrial gas fi ltration process. Over the years, use of scrim becomes limited in gas fi ltration applications due to the improvement in the fi ber consolidation process. However, scrim composites are often benefi cial for high-temperature application. A range of scrim composite materials for high-temperature application are offered by EvonikFibres GmbH, such as polyimide (P84) fi brous batt with polytetrafl uoroethylene (PTFE) scrim, P84 fi ber nonwoven with P84 scrim, a fi brous blend of polyphylene sulfi de fi ber (PPS) and P84 with PPS scrim etc. Figure 8 .5 shows the artistic view of P84 nonwoven with P84 scrim used for hightemperature application.\n\nResearch aimed at developing materials suitable for use in high-temperature applications has found that fi lter fabrics constructed from basalt-based composites produce some successful results (Johnson and Handy, 2003) . The success of such materials lies in the fact that they combine the fi ltering characteristics of P84 with key properties of the basalt fabric used as scrim, including high chemical resistance, thermal resistance and strength. In scrim fabrics, if the nonwoven layer shrinks it does not cause any change in the dimension of fi lter bags, meaning there 8.4 Hydroentangled composite HYCOFIL \u00ae nonwoven with scrim (used with permission from S\u00e4chsisches Textilforschungsinstitut e.V. (STFI), Chemnitz, Germany). is no deterioration of fi lter ability, and some research suggests that the bags remain operational at temperatures of up to 300 \u00b0C. By assessing retention of fabric strength, the service life of both P84/basalt fi lters composite (meteor bags) and membrane laminated glass fi ber bags have been estimated and found to be comparable. Ensuring functionality at high temperatures is an extremely desirable characteristic for some applications, and even at temperatures over 800 \u00b0C basalt composite fi lter fabrics can successfully clean corrosive hot gases or waste air containing hot particles.\n\nStudies from around the world have suggested that meteor fabric has been successfully used to clean air with 1500 ppm of sulfur dioxide at 160 \u00b0C and a high moisture content (South African Republic), to fi lter carbonyl of nickel from waste gas generated by nickel fi lm production (Canada) and to fi lter stack gas after molybdenum powder production in Russia. The use of LD-Mobile/HEC monitoring and cleaning technology has also been used to signifi cantly increase basalt composite fi lter bag lifespan (Medvedyev and Tsybulya, 2005) .\n\nA sandwich structure has been used to improve fi ltration performance, with two nonwoven fabrics and a polyester grid (C)-laminated together to form a nonwoven composite for use as fi lter bags (Lin et al. , 2006) ( Fig. 8.6 ). One nonwoven component (A) was made up of polyester fi bers of various levels of fi neness, with a surface layer of ultra fi ne fi bers of low melting-temperature (T m ). A second component (B) was constructed from 2.22 dtex polyester fi bers, and the two materials were then used to compose the nonwoven composite using layers in an A/B/C/B order, forming a sandwich structure with a basic weight of 500 g/m 2 . In order to bond the layers fi rmly, forming a composite nonwoven fabric, the material was then thermal calendared and needle punched. It has been claimed that in order to suit varied fi ltering media, the sandwich-structure could be molded into varied shapes. 8.5 Composite nonwoven with P84 fi brous batt with P84 scrim (used with permission from Evonik Industries, Austria).\n\nRecent emphasis on extremely high-effi ciency removal of very fi ne particles during fi ltration has led to the demand for very fi ne porous surface layers, and this demand has been met by the lamination of a membrane on to a suitably robust substrate. Because the membrane used is extremely thick (12-75 \u03bc m) it is essential that special adhesives or, where possible, fl ame bonding are used to combine it with a suitable substrate. Nonwoven materials have proved to be very suitable as substrates, especially for the support of PTFE membranes. Depending upon the intended application, substrates range from lightweight spunbonded polypropylene or polyester, to substantial fabrics such as thick needlefelts. Membrane-based fi ltration media offer unique properties that make them suitable for a wide number of applications. This includes pulse-cleaned industrial applications (bag house, airborne pollution control and gas turbine), applications in respirators, consumer and industrial vacuum cleaners, medical, biopharmaceutical and aggressive chemicals.\n\nIt is important to note that membrane fi ltration technology was greatly limited by membrane fouling. Membrane fouling leads to higher operation and maintenance costs by deteriorating membrane performances (fl ux decline vs. time, zeta potential changing during time, etc.) and eventually shortening membrane life. Hence it is sensible to use nonwoven porous support which generally has the superior dirt-holding capacity and does not have a much wider pore size distribution. Such quality, along with reinforcement of mechanical 8.6 The conformation of a nonwoven composite fabric.\n\nstrength to the membranes, gives better performance with decreased fouling. In a research work (Hegde et al. , 2011 ) on a polysulfone blend nanoporous membrane with nonwoven support consisting of fi ne polyester fi bers, it was observed that nonwoven support minimizes membrane fouling apart from providing mechanical strength to the membrane during the fi ltration process. Hence it helps in better membrane performance in terms of salt rejection, improved fl ux, thermal stability and proton conductivity. The membrane is essentially a surface fi ltration device, with little or no depth fi ltration involved in its use. In practice, many membranes are of asymmetric structure and effectively comprise two layers. The active, surface layer is a very thin skin, the permeability of which is of critical importance. The lower, thicker layer is of more open structure, its role being to serve as a mechanical support for the active layer. One of the most popular membranes is PTFE. The advantages of the PTFE (naturally hydrophobic) membrane are its superior chemical and temperature resistance and its non-sticky nature. Apart from PTFE, another most widely used acrylic copolymer membrane is inherently hydrophilic, and offers low extractability. The laminated product with nonwoven polyester fabric is employed in semiconductor water, pharmaceuticals, food and beverages.\n\nBesides the most popular ePTFE membrane, UPE membranes are also reported to be inert and compatible with harsh industrial environments. The inherent structural properties of these membranes enable fl exible composites, enhanced pleat processing and new high performance fi lter designs. While used in cleanrooms, HEPA and ULPA fi lters, they provide absolute protection. They are designed to be installed for the lifetime of the cleanroom. Prefi lters are used to capture the majority of particles in the airstream and reduce the load on the membrane fi lters. High alpha membrane fi lters lower the pressure drop, leading to signifi cant savings in energy consumption during cleanroom operations. Over the typical fi ve-year useable life of a fi lter, the resulting savings easily outweigh the added cost for the membrane fi lter (Galka and Saxena, 2009) .\n\nMost often the membrane fi lter operates at face velocities of 10 to 20 cm/s while used for cleanroom applications. The composite with ePTFE and UPE membranes provide high effi ciency at these higher airspeeds and the low pressure drop enables the high airfl ow rates with reduced power consumption. The low pressure drop, ULPA effi ciency and hydrophobic membrane properties are essential in surgical and hospital airway management, protecting both the patient and equipment. Those same properties are ideal for venting applications such as ostomy bags. The membrane can also be typically laminated to a carbon impregnated nonwoven. The combined fi lter provides for pressure relief, an absolute barrier to liquid fl ow through the fi lter in both directions and odor reduction. Depending upon the particular requirements, the membrane may be treated to enhance its oleophobic properties. In biopharmaceutical manufacturing, ePTFE and UPE fi lters can be used to vent gases produced during fermentation and cell culture. These vent fi lters require an absolute barrier to microorganisms in aerosols and to bacteria in the event the fi lter is wet out. The gamma stable properties of UPE membranes provide signifi cant benefi t in single-use applications in the medical and biopharmaceutical fi elds (Galka and Saxena, 2009) .\n\nIn industrial gas fi ltration, higher effi ciency is provided by fi lter membranes than by conventional fabrics. An expanded PTFE membrane is shown in Fig. 8 .7 . The size of the pores trap any particles below 2.5 \u03bc m in diameter whilst still allowing air to pass through, thereby proving more effective for fi ltering, particularly for small particles, than conventional fi lters ( Fig. 8.8 ). This membrane is attached to needlepunched felts, spunbonded or over spunlace nonwovens. Different fi ber polymers, including homopolymer acrylic, torcon, nomex, static conducting polyester, polyester and polypropylene, can be used to make the substrate, as can woven fabric of PTFE yarn/glass yarn. The chemically inert PTFE membrane can withstand high temperatures of up to 260 \u00b0C. When selecting the base material, the fi ltration operating temperature and chemical environment must be taken into account. High effi ciency and exceptional fl ow capability are provided by uniquely engineered microstructures in the PTFE membranes (Martin, 1999; Griffi n, 2003; Menardi Filters, 2013; Mueller sales, 2013;  Simatek A/S, 2013; W. L. Gore & Associates, 2013a) . In comparison to the plain spunbonded media, a slightly higher fi ltration effi ciency of 99.999% (99.9975% effi ciency without lamination) was given by lamination of a PTFE membrane to the spunbonded polyester media. This result was obtained while operating at a slightly higher pressure drop. Such spunbonded media have been employed in bag houses, ventilating many applications (Martin, 1999) .\n\nIn industrial gas fi ltration process, membrane fi lters also help in removal of cake. In this regard, the cake adhesion force determines effi cacy of removal of cake from the fi lter media. When the fi ltration cake is formed during the fi ltration process, the resistance to air fl ow through the fi lter increases, as a result the pressure drop increases. The cake must be removed by cleaning processes, once the pressure drop is considered relatively high, in order to minimize resistance to gas fl ow and, consequently, reduce costs. Therefore, improvements in the cake removal process may represent substantial economic gains, as well as signifi cant contributions to a greater improvement of the fi ltration process.\n\nHowever, complete removal of cake is not desirable as primary cake also takes part in fi ltration and protects the fabric. Particularly, problems occur in sugar particles where a stable primary cake formation is diffi cult due its particulate nature.\n\nMembrane fi lters may offer numerous advantages, including: hazardous contaminants is required, or where unique advantages (such as cake release) may be offered by interaction with a membrane surface. As an example, hybrid technology which combines electrostatic charges with fabric fi ltration offers improved effi ciency when utilizing membrane fabrics with lower air to cloth ratios, thanks to the substantial reduction in the burden of particulates on the fabric fi lter (Mukhopadhyay, 2009 ). In a study by Fritsky (2013) based on particulate emissions at a municipal solid waste combustion facility, the performance of GORE-TEX\u00ae membrane (PTFE)/ TEFLON\u00ae B fi berglass fabric fi lter bags was assessed. This technology is made up of two key elements: a pulse-jet fabric fi lter collector, which is additionally equipped with a lime slurry spray dryer absorber. Some factors attributable to the success of the fabric fi lter collector include: superior operation of the boiler and spray drier absorber; infrequent and low pressure pulsing; prevention of the penetration of particulate matter into and beyond the GORE-TEX membrane (wear of abrasive dust can otherwise cause fi berglass fi ber breakage); and excellent bag-to-cage fi t and bag design to minimize fl ex fatigue of fi berglass fi bers against cage wires, whilst allowing adequate bag movement for effi cient cleaning (Fritsky, 2013) . It may be added that membrane-less glass fi ber fabrics are unable to meet current emission requirements.\n\nHowever, fi ltration performance is degraded by premature membrane failure. Particularly during cleaning pulses, fi lter bags are subjected to continual stresses and fl exing which may lead to breaking of the membrane's bond, causing fi brils structure and the development of cracks. Various factors, including the frequency of cleaning pulses and the amount of pulse pressure used, affect the severity and extent of this crack development. Pulse pressure and pulse-on-time during membrane fi lter use, should be kept below 550 kPa and 350 milliseconds, respectively (Hardman, 2000; Savage et al. , 2013 ; W. L. Gore & Associates, 2013b) . Innovative development and re-engineering of PTFE membranes can achieve higher strength levels and increased air fl ow, whilst maintaining fi ltration effi ciency.\n\nA coated fi lter can be considered as composite, as it consists of two different materials in a single structure. Sometimes the application of resin to a nonwoven fi lter medium is wrongly referred to as coating. The resin is applied as saturant (sometimes referred to as an impregnate). Unlike coating, which is intended to cover the surface of the substrate, a saturant is expected to penetrate the media and form bond points in the interior as well as at the surfaces. Because of the need for penetration, low viscosity is a very desirable properly in liquid resin systems for fi lter media.\n\nIt is a little more complex to coat needlefelt fabric surfaces, and it can occasionally be diffi cult to establish the difference between coated fabrics and bonded media. Water repellency is important to a fi lter medium, particularly air fi ltration media, because it helps to prevent it from being wetted out and damaged when exposed to water. Wetting of HEPA fi lter media leads to degradation of fi lter strength to a large extent and could reduce resistance to medium breach. Water repellency is incorporated into a fi lter medium by the use of hydrophobic material in the media surface. This can be done by the use of water repellent fi bers or by water repellent coatings. Polyester and polyolefi n are examples of fi bers that are hydrophobic in nature and will impart water repellency to a fi lter medium. Waxes, silicones, and fl uorocarbon resins are examples of water repellent coatings that can be applied to fi lter media. Some binders such as styrene acrylates also impart a degree of water repellency (Hutten, 2007) . There are various methods for coating fi lter media, including surface coating, steeping, foam coating and coating with inert powders.\n\nTo achieve fi ner particle fi ltration and improve cake discharge during the industrial gas fi ltration process, microporous polymer coatings can be applied to the face of nonwoven fabrics. In addition to improving fi ltration effi ciency and cake release, this process improves the effi ciency of heat, chemical and abrasion resistance (Goosens, 1993) . When applied to the needlefelt surface, coatings form a quasimembrane structure. The addition of a Tefl on B coating on the surface of glass fi ber fabric for boiler applications is common (Carr and Smith, 1984) . During the late 1980s Ravensworth Ltd developed a range of coated materials, under the trade name of Ravlex, for achieving superior fi ltration performance. Three main product groups are generally used for the coating process: Ravlex MX, Ravlex PPC and Ravlex YP. Ravlex MX is a PTFE microporous embedded coating which is applied to the carrier needlefelt fi ltration surface. Ravlex MX is generally used for the fi ltration of fi ne particles in the chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries. Formulated from PTFE, the Ravlex PPC coating offers higher permeability than the Ravlex MX due to its larger pore size, thereby making it suitable for the fi ltering agglomerating or sticky dusts. With a pore structure similar to Ravlex PPC, Ravlex YP is formulated from polyurethane (PU), whilst another recent product, Ravlex CR, is formulated from PTFE coating. As previously outlined, all such coatings usually offer such benefi ts as high abrasion resistance, effective cake release, increased air permeability, reduced operational pressure drop (resistance to blinding), reduced cleaning frequency and extended fi lter operational life (Gibbons, 2002; Lydon, 2004; Ravensworth Ltd, 2004a , 2004b .\n\nMicroWeb 2000 and MicroWeb II media, which comprise polytetrafl uoroethylene (PTFE) and acrylic coatings, respectively, on a polyester needlefelt, have been introduced by Webron and are designed to provide reasonably high permeability. Similarly, a number of treatment processes are produced by Fratelli Testori. These include Novates , which is a coating of polyurethane (PU) on polyester or acrylic felts to provide hydrophobic and oleophobic characteristics; and Mantes , which gives enhanced chemical resistance via application of a resin chemical treatment containing PTFE to acrylics and hightemperature fi bers. Tuf-tex\u2122 thermosetting resins have been developed by Madison Filter for the coating of polypropylene, polyamide and polyester substrates. Once sprayed or knifed onto the surface of the fi lter fabric, these provide good abrasion resistance and enhanced dimensional stability (Lydon, 2004) .\n\nDuring application, fabric is steeped in a chemical solution containing high concentrations of PTFE and fl uoride resins. The fl uorides are then fi xed on the fi bers by drying and heating the fabric. Application of this process to polyester or acrylic fi ber fabrics enhances both cake release properties and protection from chemical activity (Hardman, 2000) . When treating glass fi ber fabric, the fabric is immersed in an emulsion of water, silicon, silicon graphite or colloidal graphite or fl uorocarbon compounds, before excess liquid is removed by squeezing the material through a roller, and the fabric is then dried (Ray, 2004) .\n\nFoam coating (Goosens, 1993) Aqueous-based acrylic latex is usually the principle ingredient of the treatment. In order to ensure that a fi ne, regular, stable pore structure is formed and that any specifi cally required characteristics (such as antistatic or hydrophobic properties) are produced, a range of chemical agents may constitute the precise formulation. Surface chemistry factors are the key factors governing the selection of polymer for coating, and the fi nal product must feature effective chemical affi nity between the contiguous materials involved. Figure 8 .9 shows a foam layer electron photomicrograph.\n\nUsing this approach in the production of acrylic foam-coated needlefelts produces such materials with the capability of operating continuously at temperatures up to approximately 120 \u00b0C. These materials are not, however, usually resistant to hydrolytic conditions, which can potentially lead to structural collapse and premature pressurization. The specifi c density of the foam when applied to the material is also essential for successful application. If the density is too high, the substrate is wetted excessively. This leads to inadequate penetration and poor mechanical bonding as a result of the unacceptable air permeability and too low a density, increasing the risk of delamination. (Goosens, 1993; Menardi Filters, 2013) Uniform, smaller sized pores can be achieved on the fabric surface via the use of powders, which are chemically inert additives. By pre-coating the new fabric fi lters with this powder, the fi lter surface develops a protective coating. Calendaring can help achieve effective powder coating, thanks to the lower melting point of the powder in comparison to the nonwoven fabric. The powder, which is scattered onto the surface of nonwoven fabric, melts together with the fi bers to form a layer of smaller pores.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the improvement of composite material performance via the use of low pressure plasma for coatings is gaining increasing interest. Filter media producers adopt plasma coating to improve the quality of their products. Innovative plasma processes allow depositing coatings with high levels of hydrophobicity and/or oleophobicity for use in gas fi ltration, or coatings with permanent hydrophilic effect for liquid fi lter media and battery separators. The use of low pressure plasma for surface modifi cation of fi lter media becomes more widespread because it is a dry and clean technology. The coatings applied by low pressure plasma polymerization also give good resistance to abrasion and washing. At the same time, it helps these companies to save costs because of a lower consumption of energy and chemicals (Legein, 2011) . A well-known application of plasma coating is found in the production of blood fi lter media, respiratory mask, fi lter for HVAC, etc. \n\nThe role of composite nonwovens in fi lters: providing two or more layers of different fi ltration effi ciency\n\nIn this case, composite nonwoven fi lter layers may be used in one of two forms: an upstreamlayer may be used as a prefi lter for the fi nal fi ltration layer, or, alternatively, gradient density depth fi ltration may be provided by arranging composite nonwoven layers of increasing densities. The outer layers can also serve as a containment to inhibit medium migration, dusting, and particle fallout from the inner layers. It may be added that process air from machining operations can have high concentrations of liquid aerosols, up to 100 mg/m 3 , and can cause several types of serious health effects on workers. A good drainage capacity is a vital requirement in a multistage fi ltration system. The SMS fabric as referred to earlier (Section 8.2.1) works under the aforesaid philosophy wherein the meltblown middle layer provides higher fi ltration performance as compared to spunbonded side layers. As the meltblown layer conducts the fi nal fi ltration, the spunbonded layer acts as a prefi lter. In the gradient density medium, the differing bulk of each layer provides an increasingly effi cient level of fi ltration; as the fl uid moves through these increasingly fi ne layers, smaller and smaller contaminant particles are removed. Better fi ltration has been found through producing a unique gradient structure made in two steps. In the fi rst step, a pile stitch-bonded nonwoven with a one loop surface is manufactured. In the second step, the one loop surface of pile stitch-bonded nonwoven is compressed by putting a hydroentangled nonwoven on it (Smithies and Zimmerman, 2005; Lin et al. , 2006) . The result is a gradient density medium and a photomicrograph of the structure is shown in Fig. 8.10 . The product is unique in that the fi bers of the upper pile surface are oriented in the direction of fl ow. This is in contrast to the conventional fi lter media where the fi bers are generally perpendicular to the direction of fl ow. The share in pile ranges from 98% to 99% and the number and size of cavities between the fi bers depend on the fi neness of fi bers used and the fabric thickness. The product is found to be useful for depth fi ltration applications.\n\nIn another development, wet lay technology can be used to create pore gradient in the media for the manufacture of air fi ltration media for many different applications, including HVAC, heavy duty air intake, automotive air intake, gas turbine and cabin air. Due to the gradient pore size, these media have a high dustholding capacity and low pressure drop. The multilayer construction can combine mechanical fi ltration (a prefi lter that removes most particles), electrostatic fi ltration (the middle layer allows high initial fi ltration effi ciency) and the last layer/fi lter that allows high effi ciency for all fi lter life. The triple-layer construction makes it possible to create different kinds of products by simply modifying the grammage or the fi ber composition of the layers. The composite can be pleatable on different kinds of pleating machines. It is also possible to mix different fi bers (a wide range of natural, mineral, synthetic and man-made fi bers of varying length) and obtain a wide range of fi ber orientation ranging from random to parallel with the consequent differences in fi ltration performances and applications. The system is fl exible to incorporate gas adsorption media (for example activated carbon granules) on-line in the middle layer, obtaining an effi cient fi lter for gas odor removal. This innovative concept of wet lay technology can create nonwovens with special properties, i.e. high effi ciency fi lter media (or gas-adsorption fi lter media) combined with a very low pressure drop. These advantages make these nonwovens extremely useful for applications such as cabin air or HVAC where high permeability assures a consistent air-fl ow into the fi ltration system (Ahlstrom Technical Specialties, 2001; Montefusco, 2005) . It may be noted that there are other ways of creating a gradient structure, for example the Intrepid\u2122 fi lter medium by Kimberly-Clark Worldwide, Inc. (discussed in Section 7.13.1 under the subheading Gradient density fi lter media).\n\nThe role of composite nonwovens in fi lters: combining different separation technologies/ functionality into one fi lter medium secondary reactions amongst others (Agar, 1999; Dautzemberg and Mukherjee, 2001) . One feature common to all multifunctional reactors is their facilitation for the substitution of a single process unit in place of at least two, allowing all necessary operations to be carried out simultaneously. The catalytic reactions occurring in catalytic fi lters have been found to be useful in one such application, as they are able to remove particulates from fl ue gases (from, for example, waste incinerators, diesel engines, boilers, pressurized fl uidized bed coal combustors, or biomass gasifi ers, amongst others) whilst also abating chemical pollutants (including nitrogen oxides, dioxins, volatile organic compounds, tar and carbonaceous material). A thin layer of the catalyst is applied directly onto the fi lter material, which may either be rigid (consisting of fi lter tubes made of sintered granules) or fl exible (nonwoven fabrics) (Matatov-Meytal and Sheintuch, 2002; Fino et al. , 2004) . In applications such as incinerators, pyrometallurgical and cement kilns, the combination of surface fi ltration and catalysis (ALSOM Power, 2008) has created new methodologies which destroy gaseous dioxins and captures solid phase emissions, leading to operational cost savings. Effi cient particle, NO x and VOC removal can be achieved via the use of fabric fi lters or ceramic hot gas fi lter elements (foam candles) which combine a fi ne fi ltering outer membrane with an integrated catalyst in the support structure (Spivey, 1993; Bonte et al. , 2002; Hackel et al. , 2005; Nacken et al. , 2007; ALSOM Power, 2008; Heidenreich et al. , 2008) . The combination of a fi lter and an SCR (selective catalytic reduction) reactor in one unit ( Fig. 8.11 ) is facilitated by such elements. PTFE lamination is able to function at a continuous temperature of 260 \u00b0C, so the development of a catalyst capable of the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO x with ammonia and simultaneous combustion of VOCs at such a temperature is also useful (ALSOM Power, 2008) . One such innovative catalytic fi lter concept has been reported by Fino and co-workers (2004) . This concept for reduction of NO x and the combustion of PAHs (polycyclic aromatic 8.11 Combining the principles of surface fi ltration and catalysis (reprinted with permission from Mukhopadhyay (2010) hydrocarbons) present in incinerator fl ue gases, was based on a structure combining catalytic foam with a laminated fabric fi lter for fl y-ash fi ltration.\n\nAs well as collecting particles, the removal of gaseous components such as odors or corrosive gases from air becomes increasingly important in fi ltration, specifi cally in air fi ltration. There are many applications where adsorption of odor/gases are important while removing particulates such as medical and surgical source capture (laser odors, disinfection odors, etc.), industrial vacuum cleaner fi lters, personal protection (masks, cabin-air fi lters, military environments, etc.), smoke/fume exhaust fi lters, etc. Zeolites, ion exchange resins, alumina, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), activated carbon and other materials can be used as adsorbents and are available as powders, irregularly shaped granules, extruded granules or in the form of fi bers. The majority of the nonwovens used for gas adsorption consist of carrier nonwoven layers covered with activated carbon and a prefi lter nonwoven layer ( Fig. 8.12 ). The nonwoven layers perform particulate fi ltration and the activated carbon layer separates molecular contaminants by adsorption. With average surface areas of around 1000 m 2 /g, the activated carbon surface is very irregular, with pore sizes ranging from 0.5 to 50 nm. This feature allows the surface to absorb substances with widely varying particle sizes. In addition, water vapor is not favorably adsorbed by activated 8.12 Nonwoven fi lter medium with activated carbon for gas adsorption (refl ection electron microscope, REM) (used with permission from Freudenberg Filtration Technologies, Weinheim, Germany).\n\ncarbon, as activated carbon is nonpolar. Due to this the surface can capture organic vapors at relatively high humidity. In addition, carbons with smaller pore sizes facilitate the increased capture of high-volatility vapors, due to having a greater affi nity for them. A variety of different technologies exist to adjoin activated carbon powder or granules with the nonwoven fi lter medium. This could be printing, impregnation, applying a chemical binder or thermal bonding resin or spraying fi ne hot-melt fi bers. All technologies have common aims, to keep the surface of the activated carbon as free as possible to enhance the adsorption mechanism and to maximize the loading capacity for gaseous components or odors ( Fig. 8.13 ) (Sievert, 2011) . In a study, sorbent particles (active carbon, aluminium oxide, chitosan, etc.) are caught by microfi bers in meltblown nonwovens. These nonwovens do not contain any additional agent to bind sorbent particles, hence the durability of binding sorbent particles is the key issue in this technology. Organoleptic assessment is useful to determine the durability of active carbon particle bonds in the composite nonwovens. The assessment of one part of a fi ltration face mask made out of composite nonwovens with active carbon showed that sorbent particles had a tendency to drop off (Nowicka, 2003) .\n\nAdsorbent media are increasingly being used for the removal of unpleasant odors and emission fumes in automotive cabin air fi lters, with great success. Absorbent media are also frequently employed in the removal of toxic and obnoxious chemicals from air in applications such as respirators and gas masks. Active carbon and similar adsorbents are used to combat the toxic effects of chemical agents in military affairs, to protect both military personnel and civilians. Liquid and soluble contaminants are also removed from fl uid streams by fi lter media containing adsorbents, via surface adsorption, i.e. the medium surface attracts the contaminants and the physical chemical effects hold them.\n\nFilter media are used in liquid fi ltration for the removal of unpleasant-tasting contaminants and hydrocarbons from drinking water. In home water fi lters, activated carbon fi lter papers (a form of wet laid medium) are used extensively to remove undesirable taste and odor contaminants. Adsorbents have become a key element of HVAC (heat, ventilation, air conditioning) systems in both the home and workplace in recent years. As activated carbon is extremely effi cient at adsorbing most organic chemicals, it is unsurprising that it has become the most regularly used sorbent in HVAC systems. Figure 8 .14 shows the fi lter with activated carbon for HVAC application. The fi lter (Austin air fi lter) is composed of a prefi lter (to trap larger particles such as dirt, lint and hair), a layer with a carbon and zeolite mix (to adsorb odors and gases), and HEPA fi lter paper (to remove harmful airborne particles).\n\nOne of the commercial grade nonwoven composites, known as PLEKX \u00ae , contains active ingredients greater than 82% of the media by weight to maximize adsorption and performance. A carbon layer is sandwiched between two nonwoven layers of PET substrates ( Fig. 8.15 ) in which the inner layer is activated carbon particles held together with a thermal bonding resin (10% microbinder) top and bottom. The conventional adsorption product is coconut shell carbon, but this can be boosted with chemical impregnation for higher effi ciency in critical gas applications. It is possible to use commercial carbon fi ber of 5-10 \u03bc m diameter which offers a possible alternative to organic fi bers and glass fi bers for fi lter pads and felts for extreme chemical and temperature use and to dissipate electrical charges, with additional advantage that the material can be activated as an adsorbent fi lter. The main limitation of carbon fi ber as a fi lter medium has been its expense, coupled with the fact that the current fi ber diameter sizes are higher resulting in reduced performance of current HEPA fi lters using microglassfi bers. However, carbon fi bers down to nanometer diameters are now becoming commercially available and these are going to be an exceedingly important component of the fi ber fi lter media business. 8 .14 Filter with activated carbon for HVAC application (courtesy of Austin Air Filters, 2013).\n\nThe application of chemical impregnates can also be used to supplement physical adsorption via additional chemical reactions, increasing the range of vapors that activated carbon can adsorb. Recent work has led to the development of chemically impregnated fi bers (CIF) which use smaller, more active sorbent particles than previously employed. Such CIFs allow the incorporation of such material as carbon, permanganate/alumina, or zeolite into a fabric mat. Types of impregnate based on chemical contaminants are well documented in readily available source material (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003).\n\nA number of fi lter medium and fi lter manufacturers are incorporating antimicrobial agents into their fi lter media for removal of microbes. It is worth mentioning that although HEPA fi lters are designed to fi lter out microorganisms, the arrested microorganisms can grow inside the fi lter medium under certain conditions such as suffi cient nutrients, proper humidity and temperature (Maus et al. , 2001) . Some organic media such as cellulose provide nutrition for microbiological growth. A function of activated carbon media in the HVAC fi lter is to adsorb organic material, which in turn makes the medium vulnerable to being a nutritional haven for microorganisms. In aqueous and high moisture air environments, biological activity can cause serious degradation of the fi lter medium and be a source of contamination downstream of the medium (Price et al. , 1997) . Apart from being widely used for cleanroom fi lters (particularly in the food processing industry, hospitals, etc.), swimming pool and spa fi lters are logical candidates for removal of microbes in aqueous fi ltration.\n\nIt is important to note that silver is the most adopted antibacterial agent due to its strong antibacterial activity (Spadaro et al. , 1974) , high biocompatibility (Joeger et al. , 2001) , relatively nontoxicity, excellent resistance to sterilization conditions, and long-term durability of its antibacterial effect. There have been many reports utilizing several silver-doped polymers and, maybe the most worked polymer embedded silver nanoparticle and electrospun is polyacrylonitrile (PAN) (Hoda et al. , 2012) . Antimicrobial nanofi brous fi lters (Tobler and Warner, 2005; Jeong et al. , 2007; Lala et al. , 2007) are found to be useful for improved antimicrobial functionality. In a report, a silver nanoparticles-chitosan composite was prepared by using a microcrystalline chitosan gelatinous water dispersion at ambient temperature and its aqueous solution was applied to the antibacterial fi nishing of Tencel/cotton nonwoven fabric. The fi nished nonwoven fabric showed excellent water absorption ability, air permeability and antibacterial activity against E.coli (Di et al. , 2012) . There is also an application of enzyme type antimicrobial agents for the HEPA fi lter. The primary characteristic of the enzyme fi lter is to exterminate the captured microorganisms with the lytic action of immobilized enzymes to the fi lter (Taiwan Nitta Filter Co., Ltd, 2013).\n\nDepending on application, there is a need of either elimination or retention of static charge during fi ltration. For cleanroom application, retention of static charge is benefi cial; whereas in an industrial environment (e.g., the sugar industry) dissipation of static charge is most often required. Several nonwovens are available with a conductive surface to fulfi ll the requirements of static dissipation arising from explosive hazardous applications (Sievert, 2011) . The high resistivity exhibited by the majority of synthetic fi bers makes them a potential source for static build up, which can lead to arcing and explosions. In order to reduce such risks, a range of methods have been employed to increase the conductivity of fi lter media and facilitate the movement of any static build up directly to the ground. Such methods, which have varying degrees of durability, cost, effi ciency, practicality and contamination potential, include the use of epitropic and stainless steel fi ber admixtures, chemical coatings, aluminized coatings, carbon/resin coatings and carbon lines printed on a media. At the time of writing there is a clear market potential for the development of an effi cient, durable, convenient conductive fi ber which can be successfully applied to a wide range of fi ltration applications (Scoble, 2011) . Mesh materials are frequently used in sandwich formations, primarily for static dissipation and also for structural support. Figure 8 .16 illustrates the cross-section of a fi lter medium that contains a stainless steel mesh.\n\nIn HVAC application, retention of the static charge is useful for separating small particulates. Statically charging fi bers can enhance the particle collection effi ciency of the fi lter media used in HVAC. However, it is important to relate the operating behaviours of fi lters to their charging state. A good fi lter is one that is capable of preserving a high level of charge for as long a time as possible, and hence a high collection effi ciency. The decay of the electric potential at the surface of combined nonwoven media is accelerated when the design of the air fi lter includes an activated carbon layer (Dascalescu et al. , 2010) . 8.16 Nonwoven fi lter medium with reinforced scrim (used with permission from S\u00e4chsisches Textilforschungsinstitut e.V. (STFI), Chemnitz, Germany).\n\nNonwovens are often employed in absorbent structures in order to contain the absorbent material during particulate contaminant removal. However, because structures such as those in diapers, hygienic pads, and wipes do not involve an element of separation, they are not considered as fi lter media. Although hydrophobic, polyolefi ns, have an affi nity for oil. As such, they are frequently used to absorb oil from water, for example to control oil spills at sea. It should be noted that absorbency is often an undesired quality affecting a fi lter medium. Cellulose media has a tendency to absorb water, leading to softening and weakening of the fi lter structure and subsequently a reduced fi lter life. Furthermore, fi ltration performance may be inhibited by the fi ber swelling caused by moisture absorption. Air-laid nonwoven structures, largely based on cellulose material, or short staple synthetic fi bers, including polyester, polypropylene, nylon or rayon along with super absorbent polymers (SAP), for example carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC), are frequently used for formation of composite structures. Within a composite, fi bers are inherently more effective because of their complementary structure. They also outperform super absorbent powders in handling (Dewsbury, 1990) . If a considerable amount of long synthetic fi bers feature in the web produced, it can then be spunlaced (hydroentangled). The media can be effectively used for different application areas such as water removal from oils and fuels, air fi ltration, blood treatment fi lters and personal protective equipment.\n\nIn aviation fuel treatment, composite fi lter media consisting of super absorbent fi ber (SAF) has found wide acceptance. They are used in the form of monitor cartridges which incorporate multi-layer nonwoven composite. These cartridges are capable of reducing particulates to <0.3 mg/liter of solids in effl uent and reduce free and dispersed water to <5 ppm in effl uent. Cartridges are based either on outside to inside or inside to outside fuel fl ow and offer excellent fi ltration rate capability. The fl ow through the system is halted when hit with a localized slug of water because of super absorbent gel block. Presence of water/solids in the incoming fuel will give rise to an increase in pressure differential, or a decrease in the fl ow rate, as the cartridges reach their maximum capacity for solids, water or a combination of both (Dewsbury, 1990 ).\n\nThe usage of composite nonwoven fi lter media in fi ltration is very popular worldwide. They are being widely used in industrial air fi lter bags, industrial fume cartridge dust fi lters, residential ventilation panels and pocket fi lters, air purifi ers, automotive cabin air and air intake, to name a few. Some applications of composite nonwovens along with their constructional details are given in Table 8 .1 . It is important to note that both new requirements and novel products are continuously evolving as a result of market development and demand and this need for new products and technologies continues to grow. Disruptive technologies such as nanofi bers are essential to growth and new product development across a range of fi elds, fueled by market responses, and the development of any new composite fi lter media would also originate from market needs or ideas. Looking at current market needs (Scoble, 2011) such developments may include:\n\n\u2022 Non-polytetrafl uoroethylene (PTFE) membranes.\n\n\u2022 Fibers capable of communication through alteration (for example by changing color) to highlight potential problems such as exposure to toxins, excess temperature or dangerous wear levels).\n\n\u2022 Fibers which could convert and/or neutralize pollutants, toxins, CO or other harmful gasses or solids.\n\n\u2022 Fibers which could be charged and have polarity reversed, creating a textile electrostatic precipitator.\n\n\u2022 Increased use of nanofi bers, microfi bers and splitable fi bers in an attempt to fi ll the gaps between standard, fi ne, micro-and nanofi bers.\n\n\u2022 A longer-lasting, activated carbon coating for fi bers to rival A/C depth fi lters.\n\nThe primary issues that are always being pursued with particulate fi lter improvements are: (i) higher effi ciency at lower energy consumption, (ii) longer fi lter life, (iii) greater dust load capacity, (iv) gaseous absorption and (v) easier maintenance without compromising fi lter effi ciency. In all these improvements, development of the composite fi lter media is of prime importance. Usually, ultrafi ne fi lters such as HEPA and ULPA elements use a sheet form of medium produced with glass microfi bers with a graduated matrix to provide very high dust retention capacities. Nonwoven media, made from progressively structured thermally-(meltblown and spunbonded) and resin-bonded synthetic fi bers, are gaining in use over glass fi ber media. PP melt blown supported by spunbonded material are also used as HEPA fi lters. HEPA fi lter performance is found to be improved through appropriately structured meltblown nonwovens (Hassan et al. , 2012) . There are many other variants of fi lter media composite structure such as the SMS (spunbond/meltblown/spunbond) process and variations thereof. The layered construction enables a gradual removal of fi ner airborne particles. In addition to being less expensive, fi lters exhibit greater durability, performance, safety, and environmental friendliness than their nonwoven glass fi ber counterparts (Thiele and Badt, 1996) . In addition, some designs offer varied separation modes within a single fi lter media. In automotive cabin air fi lters, for example, a nonwoven particulate fi lter layer is often combined with an activated carbon layer, offering further removal of odors and fumes.\n\nFor higher effi ciency at lower energy consumption, the use of the layered fabric concept is also reported, where layers of fi ner denier fi bers or even nanofi bers can be incorporated in the fabric structure. Various fi ner fi ber layers can be positioned at different locations within composite fi lter media to enhance the performance of HEPA fi lters. With Hollingsworth & Vose's (2013) nanoweb process, nanoweblayers (thickness in the range of 15 to 30 \u03bcm) can be applied directly to a fi ltration substrate, such as glass, cellulose or synthetic fi bers. A second nanofi ber layer of a similar or different polymer can also be applied as a coating (Leung and Hung, 2012) . NanoWave\u00ae, extended surface synthetic media has been reported to meet ASHRAE bag standards and HEPA/ULPA challenges (Anon, 2008; Wertz and Schneiders, 2009) .\n\nIn recent years, developments in fi bers and process technologies have expanded the applications of stitch bonded, hydroentangled composite nonwoven fabrics in fi ltration (Schmalz, 1998) . The use of composites in fi lter cartridges (pleated cylindrical shape) which exhibit a fabric outer fi lter and a PTFE inner membrane is also reported (Dotti et al. , 2007) . In another development, polymeric fi bers are mixed with glass fi bers which can make the structure pliable and can add a signifi cant amount of structural strength that allows pleating to be effective (Larzelere, 2006) . This will enhance the fi ltration performance of HEPA fi lter media in a smaller space.\n\nInvestigating methods for enhancing surface fi ltration is a common approach taken in developing industrial fi lter media. Although there have already been great improvements to the basic nonwoven structure, various methods to further enhance surface fi ltration are also available, in addition to the layered nonwoven fabric of membranes or coatings, fi ne/nanofi bers, or trilobal/multilobal fi bers at the upstream side. Of the several available techniques, membrane fi lters are becoming most frequently used for controlling fi ne particulates. As well as PTFE fi lter membranes increasing production costs, further research is still needed into their mechanical strength and subsequently their lifespan. As such, research and development related to this membrane arguably represents the fastest growing area of the fi ltration media market.\n\nA variety of other composite forms are also being employed in industrial gaseous fi ltration. Use of metallic wire mesh inside the nonwoven structure is prevalent for dissipation of static charges in some specifi c industries. There is growing interest of using scrim needlefelt fabric, particularly in high temperature applications. Advanced composite products of this type will undoubtedly feature strongly as a future trend in this fi eld, and the development of such products will facilitate the formation of structures that are not only more effi cient in particle capture, but also have an increased fi lter life and enhanced performance capability in more chemically and thermally challenging environments. Combined, these benefi ts translate into operational cost savings and greater control of environmental pollution.\n\nRespiratory equipment is used throughout the world to provide personal protection from a variety of noxious gases, vapors and aerosol hazards which could cause harm and even death to humans, if inhaling wood dust, chemicals, coal dust, pesticide spraying, spray painting and aerosol transmissible diseases such as infl uenza, diphtheria, SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and swine fl u. In contrast, surgical face masks have not traditionally provided protection to the wearers but have been used to keep mouth generated particles from harming a patient in a healthcare situation. Two key types of respirators, air-purifying respirators and air-supplying respirators, are shown in Fig. 8 .17 . The latter either 8.17 An example of typical respirators available in the market (courtesy of Focus Technology Co., 3M Collision Repair, 2013) . have a self-contained air supply or are supplied by an external air source. Airpurifying respirators are constructed from three key parts: a facemask; a fi lter or cartridge fi lter to remove dust, smaller particles and mists; and cartridge fi lters to remove chemical gases and fumes. Air-supplying respirators, in contrast, directly draw clear air from either an external source or a self-contained air supply.\n\nIn yet another classifi cation scheme, respirators can be graded as non-powered air-purifying particulate arrestors, powered air-purifying respirators, chemical cartridge respirators and surgical and healthcare facemasks. In each case there are varied requirements based on application. For illustration, facemasks help in stopping large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays or splatter that may contain germs (viruses and bacteria) from reaching the wearer's mouth and nose and may also help to prevent the wearer's saliva and respiratory secretions reaching those who happen to be nearby. The medical facemasks have fi ve specifi c performance characteristics (Graham et al. , 2003): \u2022 bacterial fi ltration effi ciency; \u2022 submicron particulate fi ltration; \u2022 differential pressure (an indicator of breathing comfort); \u2022 fl uid penetration resistance (to protect the wearer from blood spurts); \u2022 fl ammability.\n\nTo meet these varied requirements, a layered composite structure is used, which is typically SM/SMS or a more complex struture comprised of an inner cover, one or multiple meltblown fi ber layers, a porous fi lm layer, and an outer cover. The meltblown fi ber layers provide the aerosol fi ltration performance, while the porous fi lm layer provides the fl uid resistance. The remaining layers are incorporated to improve wearer comfort by minimizing abrasion and to allow for high-speed processing of the composite material. Polymeric nanofi ber webs are a relatively new addition to the range of materials that may be used in a composite structure design for protective apparel applications (Graham, 2003) . When using sorbent particles, bonding durability of the particles with nonwovens is important for its effective functioning (Nowicka, 2003) .\n\nThe cartridge respirator can provide careful protection against multiple hazards. It can handle not only dust and mist, but also threat agents. The cartridge fi lter normally has multiple layers for different functionalities as shown in Fig. 8.18 . The removal of the agent was brought about by its physical adsorption onto activated charcoal having an extraordinary large surface area as high as 300-2000 m 2 \u00b7g \u22121 . Further increased protection can be achieved by impregnating the charcoal with substances such as copper oxide since it reacts chemically with certain threat agents (Verdegan et al. , 2007) .\n\nIn air-purifying respirators, fi lter media is usually a composite with meltblown nonwovens as a middle layer responsible for fi ltration and spunbond or needlepunching nonwovens used as internal and external layers. The improvement of fi ltration effi ciency can be achieved with the composite of nanofi ber electrospun material with a meltblown layer (Kruci\u0144ska et al. , 2012) . In the case of respiratory tracks, protection against bioaerosols, additionally antimicrobial properties of fi bers used in fi ltering material, plays a very important role (Rengasamy et al. , 2004) . Bioactive fi bers can show biostatic or biocidal activity against microorganisms. Silver ions, antibiotics, N-halamines and quaternary ammonium are cited as bioactive agents used in antimicrobial modifi cation of nanofi bers (Yang et al. , 2003; Jeong et al. , 2007; Lala et al. , 2007; Tan and Obendorf et al. , 2007) .\n\nPerformance of respirators is largely dependent on the removal of nanoparticles and agglomerates since the special properties of nanoparticles give rise to concerns about the potential health hazards posed to workers or users that are exposed to them (O'Hern et al. , 1997) . The respirator is also adaptive to the environment it exposes, to not only remove particulates at high effi ciency and high capacity, including the threatening aerosols (toxic agents and bioaerosols), but also to detect the kind of toxins that are captured or inhaled, so quick and correct medical response can be initiated in case of an emergency.\n\nOne of the newer ways to categorize vacuum cleaners is bagged or bagless. The bags are both reusable and disposable (Cox and Healey, 2003) . In the past few years, there have been signifi cant new developments such as synthetic ultra-fi ne fi ber media, electrets, and composite media (Hsieh, 2001) . Vacuum bags with the 8.18 Illustration of cartrige respirator fi lter structure.\n\nfi lter papers enhanced by the inclusion of a meltblown substrate lining has been one such popular form of composite medium developed in recent years. Once fi lled with dirt, the fi lter bag is usually disposable (Hutten, 2007) . In a patent disclosure, the composite includes an outermost support layer and a fi lter media in the form of a multi-component sheet having a fi rst spunbond layer contacted to the outermost support layer, with a second spunbond layer forming the innermost portion of the vacuum cleaner bag. In between the aforesaid spunboded layers, preferably four layers of meltblown webs, made up of electret polymer fi ber with charge stabilized additives (fatty acid amide), are placed. Generally, all layers are composed of polypropylene. The composite fi lter media have enhanced fi ltration performance characteristics, particularly suitable for vacuum bags. Apart from particulate separation, vacuum fi lter can also remove gases/odors. Typical bagless industrial vacuum cleaners which simultaneously remove both gases and particles are shown in Fig. 8 .19 . The fi lter medium (PLEKX \u00ae ) is a composite fi lter exhibiting adsorption of high levels of gases and/ or odors.\n\nAir purifi ers, which may also be referred to as room air cleaners or residential air cleaners are usually portable units designed to provide clean air in residential environments. Such units usually contain activated carbon or a similar adsorbent to facilitate particulate and odor removal. In order to increase the effi ciency of the particulate removal, an electrostatic charge is often induced in the media. Other forms of fi lter media include glass microfi ber HEPA, synthetic fi ber and glass microfi ber blends, or composite media backed by cellulose or synthetic fi ber nonwoven supports. 8.19 Vacuum fi lter (used with permission from Graver Technologies LLC).\n\nAir demisters can be classifi ed in two distinct groups: (1) air-moisture demisters which are used to remove moisture from industrial, commercial, and residential air streams; and (2) air-oil demisters which are used to clear airstreams of hydrocarbon and oil mists. In both cases the coalescing mechanism is an important part of separation. The layered nonwoven composite is useful in these applications.\n\nIn liquid fi ltration, composite structures are often used to provide gradient density fi ltration. They are also used as prefi lters to membrane fi ltration and reverse osmosis. Needlefelts for liquid fi lter applications are usually scrim reinforced to provide adequate strength. Use of welded liquid fi lter bags containing a layer of meltblown polypropylene microfi bers is quite common. It also contains laminated multiple layers of graduated nonwoven material; the polypropylene microfi bers being secured by ultrasonic means. Another application for composite structures is taste and odor adsorbing media in drinking-water fi lters. These contain an activated carbon layer. A few uses of composites in liquid fi ltration are given below:\n\n\u2022 In absolute rated fi lter cartridges, the fi lter media can consist of three layers: a glass fi ber web between polyester fi lter layers for superior removal performance, strength and stability. In another design, PTFE membrane laminated composite media (pleated form) are used in cartridge ( Fig. 8.20 ) .\n\nThe fi lter cartridge can be used in completion fl uids, work over fl uids, gravel pack fl uids, waste-water treatment, diesel, fuel oil, process water, prefi ltration RO, acids, solvent, gels, etc.\n\n\u2022 In spunbond fi lter cartridges ( Fig. 8.21 ) , the spunbond graded density fi lter matrix (lower density at the surface of the fi lter with progressively higher density toward the center) can be used in many applications such as oil and gas, fi ne chemicals, petrochemicals, food and beverage, electronics, metal, etc.\n\n\u2022 An advanced fuel fi lter utilizes nanofi ber composite media to meet the challenge for water and particle control. The high pressure common rail fuel injection system (HPCR) requires fuel cleanliness levels far more demanding than past fuel systems or even high pressure hydraulic systems. Compared to existing fuel fi lters, the advanced fuel fi lter exhibits better water and particle removal. This results in reduced wear of HPCR components and reduced engine downtime (Wieczorek et al. , 2012 ).\n\n\u2022 In a study by Doh and co-workers, poly-vinylidene fl uoride (PVDF) was fabricated using electro-spinning technology onto Kapok nonwoven and tuned into composite fi ltration/separation media. PVDF polymers possess excellent mechanical properties and resistance to severe environmental stress, good chemical resistance, good piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties.\n\nThese specifi c properties can be utilized for separating oil and water in various fi ltration/separation media systems. Whereas Kapok is natural fi ber as a form of seedpod, the characteristics of this fi ber are light, very buoyant, resilient and resistant to water. Composite nonwovens showed good oil/water separation performance (Doh et al. , 2012) .\n\n\u2022 Dewatering of industrial sludge by geotextile tubes is found to be economical and environmental (Lin et al. , 2012) . The geotextile tube can be made out of woven-nonwoven composite.\n\nFilter cartridge (used with permission from Graver Technologies LLC).\n\nSpunbonded fi lter cartridge (courtesy of Krishna Filters and Fabrics, 2012).\n\nThe major uses of engine fi ltration are cabin air fi ltration, fuel fi ltration, lube oil fi ltration and air intake fi ltration.\n\nCabin fi lter\n\nProviding comfort and protection for passengers is the main function of the cabin air fi lter. In addition to preventing passengers taking in particulates such as pollens, spores and allergens, cabin air fi lters can also protect against odors and harmful gas pollutants. A typical cabin fi lter is shown in Fig. 8 .22 . The composite structure can be made by combinations of several types of media (Br\u00e4unling et al. , 2000) as enlisted below:\n\n\u2022 Electrospun nonwovens, which combine electrostatic effects with nanofi ber fi ltration. In general, there are two types of cabin air fi lters: particle fi lters and combi-fi lters.\n\nThe former consists of one or more layers of synthetic nonwovens such as a PP meltblown in combination with a spunbond, whereas the latter consists of a 8.22 Cabin fi lter.\n\ncomposite of synthetic nonwovens (particle fi lter and support layer) and activated carbon (Maltha et al. , 2012) . In order to apply spunbond nonwovens as a support layer or prefi lter for cabin air fi lter media, the following important performance requirements must be satisfi ed:\n\n\u2022 high air permeability for the lowest pressure drop (energy savings); \u2022 good coverage in the case of activated carbon fi lters; \u2022 high stiffness to get optimal pleats; \u2022 high dimensional stability for good processing and stable pleats; \u2022 good adhesion to the fi lter medium such as a PP meltblown.\n\nAll these performance requirements are important for good fi lter media effi ciency. Because of the unique manufacturing process of the bicomponent nonwoven, it is possible to tune its properties in such a way that the nonwoven gets optimal properties for specifi c fi ltration applications (Maltha et al. , 2012) . Recently, more and more nanofi ber/bicomponent/meltblown media are combined for particle fi ltration, whether purely mechanical or electrostatically charged or a combination thereof, with the benefi ts of activated carbon. These combined fi lters not only stop particles but also absorb a multitude of gasses and odors. New developments in the manufacturing of nonwoven media containing activated carbon, which tightly encapsulates the carbon particles, now allow manufacturers to easily pleat these media and hence design fi lters for a wide variety of shapes and sizes. By means of activated carbon applied over fl at and even layers on various textiles (Diederich, 2011) odors and VOCs in the automotive interior can be controlled. Different activated carbons can be used according to what substances and how much gas and odor fi ltration are required to be adsorbed. As typical cabin air fi lters cannot catch emissions in the car interior, especially when the car is stationary, car interiors can be made out of the composite containing activated carbon. The increasing public awareness of air quality is expected to move cabin air fi lters into more and more cars, therefore further expanding this market (Barrillon, 2005) . The Hollingsworth & Vose Company, Inc. (2013) promotes adsorptive fi lter media with multilayered structures that remove vapors and gases from the air space. Their media can be combined with almost all particulate fi ltration media and scrims. Ahlstrom products (2013) has designed its Trinetex\u00ae technology for particulate fi ltration of cabin air. This unique technology employs a gradient density effect to increase dirt-holding capacity, through a design consisting of a three-layer wet-laid medium. In order to provide optimized fi ltration effi ciency, mechanical and electrostatic fi ltration are combined, whilst fl ame retardancy and antimicrobial treatments are also available to further enhance the fi lter media.\n\nThe purpose of an engine air induction system is to deliver clean air to the throttle body of the engine, while providing engine sound tuning with minimal power loss. A typical engine air fi lter is shown in Fig. 8 .23 . Automotive air fi ltration and heavy duty air fi ltration are the two main air intake fi lter categories for engine powered vehicles, and require media with quite different properties to meet the very different demands of each system. As the automotive air-intake fi lter is frequently exposed to the high temperatures generated by a running engine, heat and temperature resistance are important requirements of the fi lter medium used, whilst additionally being expected to be fl ame retardant in some cases. For such applications the fi lter elements are single use, and once they have come to the end of their useful life they are disposed of.\n\nThe most commonly used fi lter media is resin treated cellulose from the wet lay process. Synthetic fi bers may be used to provide reinforcement for applications where higher burst strength and enhanced durability are required, such as for use in military vehicles. Filter media with a nanofi ber coating have also generated much recent interest. These nanofi bers also show very high initial effi ciency compared to standard cellulose media which only achieve their targeted effi ciency level after they have built up a suffi cient dust cake on their surface. However, there are still challenges such as cost, chemical compatibility, durability, nanofi ber layer adhesion and uniformity, and some hazards associated with solvent removal and disposal (Chuanfang, 2012 ). (Hutten, 2007) Within an engine, particle build-up may develop from various different sources. In protecting the engine from the wear and abrasion caused by such contaminants, lubrication oil fi lters ( Fig. 8 .24 ) play a key role. Ensuring oil is suffi ciently clean is key to preventing damage, particularly in areas where the oil operates in the narrow gaps between moving parts (for example at the bearings and annular spaces between the piston and wall). The advent of composite structures for lube oil fi ltration can greatly enhance the performance of an engine. 8.23 Car engine air fi lter.\n\nThe two key vehicle engine fuel systems are based on either gasoline or diesel fuel, and varied fi ltration media have been produced for the fi lters in these systems. Different media offer a variety of useful characteristics so can be selected for use depending on the required performance and environmental conditions of a particular system. Gradient density cellulosic media, gradient density/dual-phase cellulose-microfi ber glass, and cellulose-microfi ber meltblown glass are all used as fi lter media in engine fuel systems.\n\nFrom ocean tankers, barges and rail to trucks and pipelines, there is currently a varied range of distribution systems that distribute oil and fuel to varied locations (Hutten, 2007) . The contaminants include particulate matter, moisture, and microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. Apart from the particulate fi lter, a separate coalescing fi lter medium can be used for removal of moisture from fuel. The typical coalescing media for the fi lter inlet element is usually a resin-treated wetlaid medium composed of a blend of cellulose fi bers and glass microfi bers. Sometimes synthetic fi ber such as polyester is added for greater fl ex resistance. In fi lters, a fairly hydrophilic fi ber surface is desired that attracts water droplets and holds on to them as they grow in size by being struck by additional droplets. Media treated with phenolic resin generally have the right surface properties for good coalescing and separation effi ciencies. Eventually, the coalesced water particles will be of suffi cient size to be blown off the fi bers by the fl uid stream passing through the medium. Downstream of the medium, the water droplets are of suffi cient size to settle gravimetrically in the settling sump. It is key that the exit element or separator is extremely hydrophobic, rejecting any small water particles entrained in the fuel stream. The addition of very low energy media (such as a fl uorocarbon or silicone) as a coating for the exit elements can enhance this.\n\nThe development of composite nonwovens leads to improved performance of nonwovens in many areas of fi ltration."}
