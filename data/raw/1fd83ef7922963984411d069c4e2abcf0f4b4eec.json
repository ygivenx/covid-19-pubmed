{"title": "Interferon Gene Expression in Sputum Cells Correlates with the Asthma Index Score During Virus-Induced Exacerbations NIH Public Access Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript", "body": "Frequent exacerbations of asthma in adults can lead to an accelerated decline in lung function and contribute to morbidity (1, 2) . Studies have shown 44-80% of asthma exacerbations are virus induced (3, 4) . However, not all viral respiratory infections in asthmatics result in an exacerbation (5, 6) and the mechanism and risk factors for viral respiratory infections to transition into an asthma exacerbation are not well established.\n\nMany inflammatory mediators are induced upon viral infection, including interferons, which are an important component of the host defense against viral infections and are instrumental in engaging the adaptive immune response (7) . Interferons (IFN) are classified into three categories, Types I, II or III. The expression of Type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1 family and IFN-\u03b2) and Type III interferons (IFN-\u03bb family) are directly triggered by virus-induced signaling. In contrast Type II interferon (IFN-\u03b3) is generally expressed by T-cells, NK cells or monocytes in response to cytokines rather than viral particles (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . Type I and III interferons are expressed in several cell types, including but not limited to bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (12) (13) (14) . The interferons initiate a robust antiviral response impairing virus replication and cell to cell spread of virus. Additionally, some, but not all studies have suggested an association of asthma and interferon deficiency, which may predispose an individual to virus-induced exacerbations of asthma (14) (15) (16) (17) .\n\nWe previously reported that the quantitative level of viral particles in the upper airway did not correlate with the development of asthma exacerbations (18) , rather it was the extent of neutrophilic inflammation induced by the viral infection that corresponded to the development and severity of asthma exacerbation. In addition, human rhinovirus (HRV) is the most prevalent viral respiratory infection responsible for increased asthma symptoms and exacerbations (4, 19, 20) . Furthermore, HRV infections can extend into the lower airways (21) (22) (23) , suggesting that virus-induced cytokine responses in the lower airways may directly contribute to the development and severity of asthma exacerbations.\n\nInduced sputum provides a sampling of the lower airway inflammatory milieu to dissect the link between exacerbation and viruses. Both the measurement of inflammatory mediators in the sputum (24, 25) and the gene expression of sputum cells have been used to characterize lower airway inflammation (26) (27) (28) . To examine whether the presence or severity of asthma exacerbations correspond with lower airway inflammatory responses invoked by the viral infection, we examined sputum samples for expression of interferons (IFN-\u03b11, IFN-\u03b21, IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03b3), IL-13 and IL-10 in asthma patients participating in a study of naturally occurring viral upper respiratory infections.\n\nWe have previously described subjects participating in the clinical study of viral exacerbations in asthma (VIAX, University of Wisconsin Institutional Review Board approved protocol H-2005-0070) (18) . This protocol included clinical characterization and collection of induced sputum samples at the time of patient's initial cold and again following resolution of symptoms (typically 6 weeks later, which was considered to represent the \"baseline\"). See online supplement for details ( Figure e1 ). Subjects were enrolled in the study within 48 hours of the start of self-reported cold symptoms. Participants with asthma were eligible if they were 18-60 yrs of age and met the following criteria: 1) a physician diagnosis of asthma for at least 6 months, 2) history of wheezing or asthma exacerbation initiated by a cold, 3) an FEV1 \u2265 70% of predicted at the time of the first visit, 4) absence of high-dose inhaled or use of oral corticosteroids at enrollment, and 5) a positive skin test to at least one of 12 aeroallergens. Exclusion criteria included current smoking or a history of \u2265 5 pack-years, a pre-enrollment requirement of \u2265 6 puffs/day of rescue albuterol, concomitant use of more than two asthma controller agents, and current immunotherapy. Our analysis included the subset of study participants who completed the protocol, had a confirmed viral infection and provided a sputum sample with enough cells for mRNA isolation and was less than 80% epithelial cells at the baseline visit and during an acute visit with cold symptoms.\n\nVirus detection, rhinovirus molecular typing, and quantification of viral load were performed as previously described (18) . Briefly, sputum samples and nasal lavage samples were extracted from aliquots of the cell pellet containing 500,000 cells stored in Trizol Reagent. (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA and the Respiratory Multicode Assay (Eragen Biosciences, Madison, WI) was used for fluorimetric detection of common respiratory viruses with multiplex-polymerase change reaction (PCR) and flow cytometry. Samples positive for rhinoviruses were partially sequenced to determine strain.\n\nInduced sputum was obtained as previously described (18, 29) . Sputum samples were collected within four days of enrollment and again following resolution of symptoms, typically 6 weeks later. Briefly, patients inhaled nebulized saline for 5 minutes, rinsed out their mouth and then coughed with collection of the sputum. This was repeated a total of three times or until adequate sputum was obtained. The sputum was diluted 1:1 with PBS. Samples were centrifuged and cell pellets collected for examination for cell distributions by H&E staining on a slide and placed in Trizol solution for RNA purification. The sputum supernatant was mixed 1:1 with Sputolysin (EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). An adequate sputum sample was defined as having at least 500,000 WBC per sample and an acute and baseline visit epithelial cell contamination of less than 80%.\n\nSputum cell lysates were stored at \u221280C in Trizol, RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then reversed transcribed using Superscript III (Life Technologies, Grand Island, New York). Quantitative PCR was performed by combining cDNA with random primers, nucleotides, and RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI) as previously described (30) . Primers and probes from Applied Biosytems for IFN-\u03b11 (HS03044218 g1), IFN-\u03b21 (HS00277188 s1), IFN-\u03bb1 (HS00601677 g1), IFN-\u03b3 (HS00989291 m1), IL-10 (HS99999035 m1), IL-13 (HS01124272 g1), MBP (HS00794928 m1), MMP-9 (HS00957562 m1), neutrophil elastase (HS00236952 m1) and TGF-\u03b2 (HS00998133 m1) were combined with Taqman gene expression mastermix in duplicate singleplex real time PCR (Stepone Plus PCR system, Applied Biosystems). Results were calculated using the 2 \u2212\u0394Ct method relative to the endogenous control, Human \u03b2glucuronidase (GUSB, 4333767F, Life Technologies)\n\nThe Asthma Index was calculated daily as previously described (31) using the worksheet available in the article online repository. Briefly, reference evening peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) and total asthma symptom score values were calculated as the mean of the data from the most stable week during the resolution visits. Asthma symptom scores captured rescue bronchodilator use, nocturnal awakening, chest tightness, wheeze, cough and dyspnea. Rolling averages of the symptom scores and the total daily percent decline relative to the reference PEFR were compiled throughout the study enrollment capturing data from the previous 48 hours. The Asthma Index was then calculated serially by subtracting the baseline score from each 48-hour average score. An Asthma Index score greater than or equal to 30 was previously shown to be consistent with consensus guideline definitions of a moderate exacerbation (31) . The peak Asthma Index refers to the highest value obtained within 3 days of acute visit sputum collection.\n\nThe associations between cytokine levels and peak Asthma Index were examined using linear models. Asthma Index was treated both as a continuous variable and as a categorical variable (AI<30, non-exacerbation versus AI>=30, exacerbation). Cytokine levels were logtransformed and Asthma Index was square-root transformed to approximate normality for analysis. A p-value less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Analyses were conducted using R version 2.15 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) or SigmaPlot version 11.0 (Sysstat Software, San Jose, CA). Table 1 . Virus identification and sequencing of rhinovirus subgroups demonstrated no significant differences between subjects with or without an exacerbation. Subjects with an exacerbation had a significantly greater reduction in peak expiratory flow (\u221276.0 versus \u221238.0, p=0.03). Exacerbations were not associated with significant changes in FEV1. Cold symptom scores increased significantly between baseline and acute visits in the exacerbation group (0.0 versus 14.0, p=0.001) and in the cold group (0.0 versus 9.5, p<0.001). Exacerbations were associated with increases in the peak Asthma Index (median 40 [range 31.8-52.3] vs. 18.5 [range 11.0-22.5]), and these observations are comparable to the results from the complete VIAX cohort (18) .\n\nAs shown in Table 2 , there were no significant differences in baseline sputum eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes or macrophage between those who experienced an exacerbation and those who did not. The most notable observation was that exacerbations were associated with significantly greater neutrophil influx, as previously reported (18) . Sputum neutrophils were significantly greater in patients who had a virus-induced exacerbation, as measured by a greater difference in the mean percent (20.4%, p=0.02) and mean total number of cells (20.6 \u00d7 10 5 cells/ gram, p=0.009).\n\nAs shown in Figure 2 , IFN-\u03b3 mRNA expression in the lower airways was significantly greater (p=0.002) during exacerbations. There was also a trend during exacerbations for greater expression of IFN-\u03b21 (p=0.06) and IFN-\u03b11 (p=0.06) mRNA. In addition, the peak Asthma Index correlated with expression of IFN-\u03b3, IFN-\u03b11, and IFN-\u03b21 mRNA in sputum cells during exacerbations (p=0.004, p=<0.001, and p=0.001, respectively, Table 3 ). Exacerbations were also associated with greater expression of IL-10, MBP, and IL-13 mRNA in sputum samples (p=0.06, p=0.02, and p=0.03, respectively, Figure 3 ). In addition, the peak Asthma Index correlated with sputum IL-13 mRNA expression (p= 0.006), with similar trends for MBP and neutrophil elastase mRNA (p=0.08 and p=0.08, respectively, Table 3 ).\n\nThe objective of this study was to identify clinical and inflammatory features of airway inflammation, as measured in sputum, that differentiate virus-induced exacerbations from uncomplicated viral colds. As expected, exacerbations were associated with greater gene expression of inflammatory genes and mediators, such as IL-13, IL-10, and eosinophil Major Basic Protein. Also, the percentage of rhinovirus isolated in subjects as well as subgroup classificaitons are consistend with previous observations in the literature (18, 32) . Additionally, our findings indicate that exacerbations were associated with greater expression of IFN-\u03b3 mRNA in sputum cells. Furthermore, quantification of IFN-\u03b11, IFN-\u03b21, and IFN-\u03b3 sputum gene expression significantly correlated with a quantitative measure of symptom severity, the Asthma Index.\n\nSeveral studies have reported interferon responses during a viral infection differ in asthma patients compared to healthy controls; however, the findings are controversial. Whether the difference between asthma patients and healthy controls is due to deficient interferon responses to virus or an exaggerated response is not clear. For example, analyses of in vitro cell cultures (primary bronchial epithelial cells, monocytes, and alveolar macrophages derived from asthma patients) infected with HRV have shown diminished IFN-\u03bb, \u03b1, \u03b3 and \u03b2 responses compared to cells derived from control non-asthma patients (15, 17, (33) (34) (35) .\n\nFurthermore, those patients with lower IFN-\u03bb release from in vitro infected BAL cells exhibited a greater drop in FEV1 following experimental HRV inoculation (17) . For asthma patients not currently experiencing an exacerbation or viral infection, sputum gene expression of IFN-\u03bb 1 inversely correlated with their asthma symptom scores (28) . These deficiencies in interferon production are thought to increase susceptibility in asthmatics to development of viral infections in the lower airway (16, 36) .\n\nIn contrast, other studies demonstrate that asthma is associated with intact interferon responses that are positively associated with lower airway symptoms. IFN-\u03b3 protein levels in nasal lavage samples from atopic asthma patients and healthy controls exhibited comparable increases during experimental HRV-16 inoculation (5). Interestingly, one study reported that asthma symptoms were related to both lower expression of IFN-\u03bb 1 (IL-29) mRNA and increased expression of IFN-\u03bb 2 (IL-28) in sputum cells (28) . In addition, IFN-\u03bb protein and mRNA expression in upper airway respiratory secretions were increased in wheezing adolescents during a viral infection compared to non-wheezers, and correlated with the severity of wheezing illness (37) . Our data are consistent with the latter findings, as we have shown increased lower airway expression of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3 in those experiencing an exacerbation. Furthermore, IFN-\u03b3, IFN-\u03b21, and IFN-\u03b11 show significant correlations with quantification of asthma symptom severity as measured by the peak Asthma Index. These data suggest the possibility that a vigorous interferon response during a viral respiratory infection could contribute to the development and severity of an asthma exacerbation. Conceptually, the interferon expression may serve two roles: first, at onset of viral exposure, interferons may protect from severe infection; second, once infection has occurred, interferons may contribute to promoting the inflammatory cascade in the airway contributing to increased asthma symptoms.\n\nOur study has several novel features. We focused on gene expression as the biomarker(s) for the inflammatory milieu in the lower airways. We examined asthma patients with naturally occurring viral infections. Finally, we utilized a quantitative measure of asthma symptom severity, the Asthma Index, which incorporates both subjective and objective measures of control. It is notable that our gene expression data for IL-10, MBP, and IL-13 are consistent with published observations on the protein expression of these and related products in the airway (24, 26, 27, 38, 39) , which provides validation for the use of sputum cell gene expression as a surrogate biomarker for the respective cytokine or mediator.\n\nOne of the limitations of our study is the inability to identify the cell type responsible for the change in gene expression. Therefore, the changes in mRNA expression may be the result of either increased transcription per cell or fluctuations in cellular composition. Also, our analysis focused on gene expression, and confirmatory studies of protein secretion are needed. On the other hand, use of RT-PCR is a very sensitive method of quantifying gene expression and it is possible that many proteins that cannot be detected in sputum (either due to low levels of protein expression or lack of sensitive/specific reagents) can readily be assessed by mRNA levels. Additionally, since sputum cell samples mainly consist of leukocytes, our data may not reflect changes in epithelial cells gene expression.\n\nThis study was conducted on a group of mild asthmatics who experienced exacerbations that did not require oral prednisone or a visit to the emergency department. Given this limitation, it is notable we were able to detect significant associations between interferon expression and exacerbation severity. We speculate that these findings can be extrapolated to more severe exacerbations, but this remains to be tested. It is also unknown whether the change in interferon responses of asthmatic patients is different from a control \"non-asthmatic\" population.\n\nIn summary, viral infections induce expression of interferons, which have well-recognized antiviral properties. Our data suggest that during the early and acute phases of a virusinduced exacerbations of asthma, interferon responses are increased relative to uncomplicated colds. The causality of this association remains to be determined, but suggest that either more severe illnesses induce greater interferon responses, or alternately, exuberant virus-induced interferon responses contribute to airway inflammation and exacerbations of asthma.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\nillness is increased in asthma and related to virus load and Th1/2 cytokine and IL-10 production.
