Anecdotal accounts suggest that life stress frequently triggers the development of MS symptoms. Psychological stress has been implicated in the onset of MS, and acute life stressors have been shown to be correlated with relapses in established MS. A meta-analysis of 14 papers concerning stress and MS concluded that there was 'a significantly increased risk of exacerbation associated with stressful life events' [1] . However, the mechanisms underlying the role of stress in MS are complex and difficult to investigate in patients.\n\nThe etiology of MS is unknown, although epidemiological studies have implicated an infective agent as a possible initiating factor. Epidemiological surveys have shown that an increased risk of developing MS was associated with late infection with mumps, measles and Epstein-Barr virus. Additionally, exacerbations of MS are frequently preceded by viral infections. Interestingly, several viral agents including measles, mumps, parainfluenza type I, coronavirus, Epstein-Barr and human herpes type 6 have been detected in the brains of MS patients. Thus, it is intriguing that the antiviral, IFN-\u2424 , has been reported to have a beneficial effect on relapsing/remitting MS. One mechanism of stress-induced exacerbation might be via increased glucocorticoid secretion resulting in immunosuppression and reactivation of latent viruses, such as herpes virus.\n\nViruses are known to cause demyelination in experimental animal models: measles virus in rats; canine distemper virus in dogs; visna virus in sheep; JHM mouse hepatitis virus, Semliki Forest virus and Theiler's virus in mice. Therefore, in order to understand the pathogenesis of MS it is appropriate to study an animal model of virusinduced demyelination such as Theiler's virus infection. Theiler's virus infection in mice represents not only an excellent model for the study of the pathogenesis of MS but also a model system for studying disease susceptibility factors, mechanisms of viral persistence within the CNS and mechanisms of virus-induced autoimmune disease.\n\nTheiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus is a Picornavirus that causes an asymptomatic gastrointestinal infection and occasionally paralysis in mice. Following intracerebral infection, susceptible strains of mice develop a primary inflammatory demyelination with similarities to MS. The immune system plays a crucial role in early clearance of viral infection from the CNS, via activation of NK cells, anti-viral CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and also through the generation of virus-specific antibodies. Susceptible mice fail to clear the virus from the CNS and consequently develop the late demyelinating disease. In the late disease, the immune system takes on a pathogenic role in demyelination and CNS destruction.\n\nOur group has been investigating the effect of stress on the pathogenesis of Theiler's virus-induced demyelination (TVID). Using the restraint stress model we have shown that chronic stress increased: glucocorticoid secretion, sickness behavior, viral titers in the CNS and mortality following infection with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus [2] . Restraint stress also decreased innate immune function, in particular NK cell activity [3] , chemokine [4] and cytokine expression in the spleen and CNS [5] which resulted in decreased inflammatory cell infiltrates into the CNS [6] .\n\nFurthering these studies, we have also shown that restraint stress reduces the adaptive immune response to Theiler's virus. In these experiments, mice were assigned to treatment groups and (1) either stressed overnight commencing day-1 and infected at day 0 and then stressed each night for 8 nights; (2) stressed at day-1 and mock infected with sterile phosphate-buffered saline at day 0, and then stressed each night for 8 nights; (3) nonstressed and infected at day 0; (4) nonstressed and mock infected at day 0. Then at day 8 postinfection, specific T cell responses were measured in the spleen and CNS using virus-specific ELSIPOT assays. We observed that stress reduced splenic CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses to virus, and sig-Effects of Stress on Immune Response to Theiler's Virus Neuroimmunomodulation 2010;17:169-172 171 nificant reductions were noted in the number of IFN-\u2425producing CNS infiltrating antiviral CD8 + T cells [7] . Stress also reduced the mRNA levels for the Th1 transcription factor T-bet and the Th2 transcription factor GATA3. In addition, virus-induced Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels were also decreased. This indicates that stress causes suppression in both Th1 and Th2 T cell responses rather than a Th1 to Th2 switch.\n\nGlucocorticoids were implicated as the main mediators of the stress-induced immunosuppression seen in these experiments since we were able to partially reverse the effects by concurrent administration of the glucocorticoid/ progesterone antagonist mifpristone (RU486), and conversely we were able to mimic the effects by administration of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone [7] .\n\nIn earlier studies of chemokine expression in the CNS, we noted a stress-induced decrease in virally induced RANTES, Ltn, and IL-10 [4] . Stress decreased levels of circulating chemokines: RANTES and MCP-1 [7] . Interestingly, IL-6, G-CSF and KC were increased by stress. The stress-induced increase in both G-CSF, a neutrophil hematopoietic factor, and KC, a neutrophil chemoattractant may account for the increase in circulating neutrophils we have previously observed in stressed mice [2] . All these data are diagrammatically displayed in figure 1 which explains the effect of stress on the immune response to Theiler's virus.\n\nMice subjected to chronic restraint stress during the first 4 weeks of Theiler's virus infection developed more severe demyelinating disease during the late phase of the disease [8] . Taken together with our observations on the Color version available online effects of stress on the immune response to Theiler's virus, we propose that stress induces high concentrations of glucocorticoids which results in immunosuppression, reduced ability to clear virus and subsequently increased inflammatory demyelinating disease. Additionally, restraint stress facilitated the systemic dissemination of Theiler's virus resulting in increased viral replication in the heart and the development of a cardiotropic variant of the virus that induced pathology in the heart [6] . The phenomena of stress-induced immunosuppression leading to increased viral replication in the CNS of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-infected mice was also observed in two more naturalistic stress models, social disruption stress [9] and maternal separation stress [10] .\n\nOur work has shown that stress has a global immunosuppressive effect on the immune response to Theiler's virus and that glucocorticoids play a key role in this phenomenon. Both Th1 and Th2 responses are decreased by stress as indicated by decreased transcription factors T-bet and GATA-3 and Th1/Th2 cytokine responses. The decreased immune response to Theiler's virus leads to increased viral titers in the CNS and also increased viral dissemination. Relating our findings to the impact of stress on humans, we propose that stress would make an individual more susceptible to viral infections that might lead to the development of autoimmune diseases such as MS or indirectly precipitate MS relapse."}
