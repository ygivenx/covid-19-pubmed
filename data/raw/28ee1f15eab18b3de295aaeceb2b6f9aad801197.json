{"title": "Topographical Mapping of Epitopes on the Glycoproteins of Murine Hepatitis Virus-4 (Strain JHM): Correlation with Biological Activities", "body": "Overlapping epitopes A(E1) and B(E1) constituted one site and epitope C(E1) the other.\n\nThe JHM strain of MHV-4 is a neurotropic member of the Coronaviridae (Tyrrell et al, 1975) . Under appropriate conditions or by the use of attenuated temperature sensitive mutants of MHV-4, demyelination results (Weiner, 1973; Stohlman and Weiner, 1981; Knobler et aL, 1981 Knobler et aL, , 1982 which has been investigated for parallels with human demyelinating disorders of unknown etiology (Maugh, 1977) . Studies have shown that demyelination during MHV-4 infection is a direct effect of virus infection of the oligodendrocyte (Weiner, 1973; Lampert et al, 1973; Knobler et aL, 1982) , an effect normally masked during acute infection when neuronal infection results in fulminant encephalomyelitis (Weiner, 1973; Stohlman and Weiner, 1981) . Despite elegant morphological studies from several laboratories (Weiner, 1973; Lampert et al, 1973; Nagashima et al, 1978; Sorensen et ah, 1980; Knobler et cd, 1982) , detailed understanding of the factors which influence virus-induced demyelination is still lacking.\n\nThe MHV virion contains a helical nucleocapsid composed of a 5.4-6.9 X 10\" relative molecular weight (ilf,) singlestranded, message sense RNA and a 50-63 K (M, X 10p3) nucleocapsid (N) protein (Siddell et a& 1982; Sturman and Holmes, 1983) . In addition to the N protein, the virion contains two glycoproteins termed El and E2 by Sturman and Holmes (1977) . A structural model for the incorporation of El and E2 into MHV virions has recently been proposed (Sturman et a& 1980; Sturman and Holmes, 1983) . The large glycoprotein E2 is associated with the virion peplomers, contains N-linked oligosaccharides, and is composed of at least two related polypeptides: 150-200K and 90-100K (Sturman and Holmes, 1977; Wege et al, 1979; Bond et or, 1979; Siddell, 1982 ). An intracellular 150K glycosylated precursor polypeptide has been described (Siddell et al, 1981; Siddell, 1982) with an apoprotein of llO-120K (Rottier et a& 1981) . The El glycoprotein contains O-linked oligosaccharides (Niemann and Klenk, 1981; Holmes et al, 1981) and appears to be embedded in the membrane. Available evidence suggests that El interacts with the internal N protein (Sturman et a& 1980) . In the virions, both glycosylated 23-26K and nonglycosylated 18-23K forms of the El protein exist (Wege et c& 1979; Siddell et al, 1981; Rottier et a& 1981) .\n\nMonoclonal antibodies (MAb) were generated in this laboratory against the structural proteins of MHV-4. These MAb were used in previous studies to assign the attachment and fusion activities of the virus to the glycoprotein E2 (Collins et al, 1982) . In order to more precisely define the structure of the El and E2 glycoproteins, we have performed competition enzyme immunoassays to define epitopes associated with previously described biological activities of the MHV-4 glycoproteins.\n\nVirus and cell culture. Murine hepatitis virus-4 was originally obtained from Dr. Leslie P. Weiner (Collins et aL, 1982) and is routinely propagated and assayed in this laboratory on L-24 cells as previously described (Collins et aL, 1982) . Cells were infected with MHV-4 (m.o.i. = 0.01-l) and incubated until extensive syncytium formation was observed (15-20 hr) to serve as a source of viral antigen for immunoblotting and EIA assays described below.\n\nto MHV-4.\n\nof MAb to MHV-4 structural proteins were described previously (Collins et uL, 1982) . Virus neutralization assays and passive protection studies were performed as described (Buchmeier et aL, 1984) .\n\nWestern immunoblotting.\n\nIn addition to immunoprecipitation (Collins et aL, 1982) , specificity of our MAb was defined by Western immunoblotting (Towbin et aL, 1979) . For this technique, cytosol extracts of infected and control uninfected L-24 cells were prepared by a modification of a previously described method (Collins et aL, 1982) . Infected and control cultures (2 X 10' cells) were washed with rinse buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0; 137 mM NaCl; 1 mM CaClz, and 0.5 mM MgClz) and solubilized for 20 min in 3-ml ice-cold lysis buffer (rinse buffer with 1% (v/v) Nonidet-P40; 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1% (v/v) aprotinin). Cell debris was pelleted at 1000 g for 10 min and cytosols were obtained after centrifugation at 100,000 Q for 60 min. Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on 10.5% acrylamide separating gels (Laemmli, 1970) . Nitrocellulose replicas were prepared by electrophoretic transfer for 6 hr at 5 V/cm as previously described (Erickson et aL, 1982) . Quantitative transfer of even high molecular weight (>150K) proteins was achieved.\n\nFollowing transfer, nitrocellulose was saturated by incubation for 60 min with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS with 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet-P40, 0.1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 1% (v/v) normal goat serum. Strips were incubated for 3 hr at 37\" with hybridoma cell supernatants diluted fourfold with the same buffer, then washed three times in PBS + 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Bound antibodies were detected by incubation for 1 hr with '%I-labeled, affinity-purified goat antibody to mouse Ig (Buchmeier et CAL, 1981; sp act 3-5 &i/pg; lo6 cpm per gel lane). The strips were again washed, dried, and autoradiographed.\n\nCoupling of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to mono&ma1 antibodies. Immunoglobulin fractions were isolated from ascites fluids by precipitation at 4' with an equal volume of saturated ammonium sulfate (pH 7.0). After overnight dialysis against three changes of 0.01 M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5, immunoglobulin (Ig) concentrations were estimated by radial immunodiffusion against goat antimouse IgG (Meloy Laboratories, Springfield, Va.). Antibodies were coupled to HRP (Sigma, St. Louis, MO.) by the periodate method (Wilson and Nakane, 1978) and stored in an equal volume of glycerol at -70\". This technique has previously been TALBOT ET AL.\n\nshown to covalently couple an average of one enzyme molecule per immunoglobulin via secondary amino groups (Wilson and Nakane, 1978) .\n\nEnzyme immunoassays (EIA). The solidphase immunoassay principle employing microtiter plates was used throughout. Preliminary studies (Talbot and Salmi, unpublished, 1983) showed that certain subcellular fractions from infected cells could be used as antigens on solid phase. A particulate fraction was prepared from uninfected and MHV-binfected cells as follows. Cells were scraped off the flasks, washed three times with cold Dulbecco's phosphate buffer saline, pH 7.4 (PBS), and resuspended in the same buffer (4 X lo7 cells/ml).\n\nCell suspensions were disrupted by five cycles of rapid freezing and thawing followed by two 1-min cycles of sonication on ice slurry with a Microtip at a maximum energy in a probe-type sonicator (Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Inc., Plainview, N. Y.). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 min and particulate material pelleted at 100,000 g for 60 min. Pellets were resuspended in PBS and sonicated as above. Protein concentration was determined (Lowry et al, 1951) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Antigens were stored at 4' in the presence of 0.5 mM merthiolate.\n\nMicrotiter plates (Linbro Titertek, Flow Laboratories, Cat. No. 76-202-05) were coated with 0.1 ml/well of viral or control antigens with total protein concentration of 5 pg/ml. After overnight antigen coating at room temperature, free binding sites of the polystyrene wells were blocked with 0.15 ml/well of EIA diluent (PBS supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20, and 0.5 mM merthiolate).\n\nAfter an incubation of at least 1 hr at room temperature, antigen-coated plates were used for antibody binding or for competition binding assays.\n\nIn antibody binding assays, serial twofold dilutions of monoclonal antibodies as ascites fluids were incubated in antigencoated plates for 75 to 90 min at room temperature which was the incubation temperature in all the subsequent steps as well. The plates were washed three times with a washing solution (PBS supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) and HRP-labeled affinity-purified antibodies to mouse IgG and IgM (Boehringer-Mannheim Biochemicals, Indianapolis, Ind.) were added. After 75 to 90 min incubation, the plates were washed as above and 0.1 ml of the substrate solution consisting of 3 mM hydrogen peroxide and 2.2 mM o-phenylenediamine in 0.1 Msodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0 was added into each well. The enzyme reaction was terminated after 30 min incubation in subdued light by adding 0.1 ml of 1 NHCl into each well. Optical densities were read (OD,,) with a Titertek Multiskan photometer (manufactured by Eflab, Helsinki, Finland). The competition binding assays were performed as above with the following modifications.\n\nAfter 75 to 90 min incubation of fourfold dilutions of the ascites samples containing different MAb, only one gentle washing cycle was performed. A previously determined optimal amount of HRP-conjugated MAb to MHV-4 was added to the plates in volumes of 0.1 ml/ well. After 75 to 90 min incubation, plates were washed three times, substrate added, and ODdg2 read as above. Since the nonspecific binding of individual conjugates varied considerably, binding to control antigen was taken to represent background, and binding of each conjugate to viral antigen as maximum binding. This difference was taken to represent 100% binding, and the relative inhibition by the competing first antibody was normalized to this scale in each individual test.\n\nPolypeptide specificity of mono&ma1 antibodies to MHV.4. The polypeptide specificity of monoclonal antibodies against MHV-4 was initially characterized by immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled viral proteins from infected cell extracts (Collins et a& 1982) . While specificities could be assigned based upon the predominant polypeptide in immunoprecipitates, coprecipitation of other viral polypeptides was occasionally observed. These ambiguities were eliminated by the immunoblotting technique, as illustrated in Fig. 1A . Monoclonal antibodies to the E2 glycoprotein reacted with virus-specific polypeptides migrating at approximately 100, 160, and 230K, as well as with high molecular weight aggregates which did not penetrate separating gels (Wege et aL, 1979; Siddell et aL, 1981 , 1984) . Enzp,w immunoassay of MAb to MHV-4 glycoproteim. Comparative studies indicated that a membrane-enriched fraction prepared from virus-infected cells provided the optimal antigen source and that all antibodies showed binding characteristics to the antigen preparation equivalent to their binding to purified virions (Talbot and Salmi, unpublished, 1983) . The minimum antigen concentration (0.5 pg total protein per well) which provided maximum antibody binding with all of the three classes of antibodies examined was selected and used throughout this study (Fig. 2) . Binding characteristics of MAb to MHV-4 glycoproteins were determined by parallel solid-phase EIA titrations using a single antigen preparation.\n\nBinding curves of typical antibodies are presented in Fig. 3 . Most antibodies appeared to bind with high avidity to the viral glycoproteins since the maximal level of measurable binding was reached (Frankel and Gerhard, 1979; Stone and Nowinski, 1980; Massey and Schochetman, 1981) .\n\nMolecular topography of epitopes on MHV-4 glycoproteins by competitim binding EIA. Our initial attempts to define the topography of antigenic sites on the MHV-4 glycoproteins made use of conventional solid-phase competitive radioimmunoassay with radioiodinated MAb. However, the binding efficiencies of many of the purified MAb were diminished following radiolabeling.\n\nOn the other hand, most of our MAb retained their binding properties when conjugated to peroxidase (Wilson and Nakane, 19'78) , thus allowing the use of a sensitive enzyme-linked immunoassay format. Monoclonal antibodies to MHV-4 described in Table 1 conjugates obtained for each MAb. Conjugates with lower EIA titers were added at higher concentration and their binding could be inhibited to a lesser extent by unconjugated homologous antibodies, thus decreasing the sensitivity of the assay. For that reason, some conjugates did not provide reliable probes in competition binding assays. Nevertheless, all the available antibodies were tested as unconjugated competing antibodies. Figure 4D shows the absence of nonspecific blocking in our competition binding assay since none of the glycoprotein antibodies inhibited the binding of an antibody probe to the N protein.\n\nTwo major antigenic regions could be distinguished on the small glycoprotein El (Fig. 4) . One site, designated C(El), was defined by the monoclonal antibody 5B128.3. None of the other MAb tested (five against El, eight against E2, and three against N) blocked the binding of the probe; only homologous inhibition was observed (Fig. 4C) . Another site was defined by El antibodies 5B119.4, 5A5.2, and 5B11.5, which showed intermediate levels of reciprocal competition (Figs. 4A and B ). This intermediate blocking could indicate structurally close and possibly overlapping epitopes which generated mutual incomplete steric hindrance upon antibody binding. Hence, we assigned epitope A(E1) to the MAb 5B119.4 and epitope B(E1) to 5A5.2 to stress this uncertainty. The target epitope of 5B11.5 could not be precisely assigned since reliable HRP-conjugated probes of this antibody were not obtained and inhibition of both 5B119.4 and 5A5.2 conjugates was observed.\n\nFour antigenic sites could be assigned to the large glycoprotein E2 (Fig. 5) . Site A(E2) was defined by two antibodies, 5B19. (-) or control (---) L-24 cells. Control curves were obtained for each antibody and showed minimal deviations from the mean curve shown here. Bound antibodies were detected with HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig, as described in the text. Immunoglobulin concentration (pg) represents the total amount of unconjugated antibodies added. glycoprotein (Figs. 5A and B) . Sites B and C(E2) were respectively defined by antibodies 5A13.5 and 4B11.6 and only homologous blocking was observed at those antigenic determinants (Figs. 5C and D) . Site D(E2) was defined by the four nonneutralizing antibodies which could not compete for antibody binding at sites A, B, or C(E2) (data not shown).\n\nIn this study, 13 monoclonal antibodies directed against the structural glycopro-teins of MHV-4 were used in competition binding immunoassays to identify antigenie regions on these glycopeptides (Yewdell and Gerhard, 1981) . Based on our data and biological activities of the monoclonal antibodies studied, we were able to associate specific properties to these epitopes. Three nonoverlapping antigenic sites designated A(E2), B(E2), and C(E2) were defined on the E2 glycoprotein by four neutralizing antibodies. Sites B(E2) and C(E2) were identified by the binding of 5813.5 and 4B11.6, respectively. Two antibodies, 5B19.2 and 5B170.3, were both directed to site A(E2). Each competing pair was examined by reciprocal competition assays with both members in a combination conjugated in turn to minimize the effect of differing avidity (Stone and Nowinski, 1980) . These results presented an interesting paradox. Antibody 4B11.6 directed against site C(E2) neutralized virus efficiently in vitro but failed in other studies to protect mice against a lethal virus chalil\"HAP-581i0.3 bEi 6'1 pg lmmunoglobulin FIG. 5 . Competition binding EIA with HRP-conjugated monoclonal antibodies directed against glycoprotein E2. Assays were done as described in the legend for Fig. 4 . Enzyme-conjugated antibodies directed against E2 were l ,5B19.2 (A); V, 5B170.3 (B), A, 5A13.5 (C); and n , 4B11.6 (D). lenge in wivo (Buchmeier et d, 1984) , whereas three other neutralizing antihodies, 5B19.2, 5B170.3, and 5A13.5, were protective in wivo. These MAb were directed to two topographically distinct antigenic sites designated A(E2) and B(E2). This indicates the presence on E2 of multiple topographically distinct regions associated with virus attachment on the host cell. Preliminary studies indicate that antigenic variation at sites B(E2) and C(E2) can be detected in various MHV strains (Talbot and Buchmeier, unpublished, 1984) . These two antigenic sites may be conformationdependent determinants since their reactivity is lost after SDS denaturation and Western immunoblotting (Table 1) . We have made the assumption that antigenic sites A, B, and C(E2), all of which give rise to neutralizing antibodies, are freely accessible to the external milieu.\n\nFour nonneutralizing E2 antibodies were shown by solid-phase EIA to bind to the viral protein, at a distinct site or sites designated D(E2) since they did not affect antibody binding to antigenic sites A, B, or C(E2). More definitive characterization awaits development of reliable conjugates of these antibodies.\n\nBinding curves for these nonneutralizing antibodies were similar to those of the neutralizing anti-bodies suggesting that failure to neutralize was not due to gross differences in titer or binding avidity. Nonneutralizing antibodies to viral attachment proteins have now been demonstrated for the retroviruses (Massey and Schochetman, 1981; Bruck et ak, 1982) , togaviruses (Roehrig et a& 1980; Kimura-Kuroda and Yasui, 1983) , orthomyxoviruses (Breschkin et al, 1981; Carter et d, 1982) , rhabdoviruses (Volk et aL, 1982) , and reoviruses (Burstin et &, 1982) . We found that antibodies to El or E2 which failed to neutralize in vitro also did not alter the disease process in tivo (Buchmeier et al, 1984) , in contrast to nonneutralizing MAb to Sindbis virus which prevented lethal encephalitis in viva (Schmaljohn et uk, 1982) .\n\nGlycoprotein El contained at least three epitopes, designated A(El), B(El), and C(El), defined by five MAb. These epitopes could be grouped into two nonoverlapping antigenic sites, as defined by Yewdell and Gerhard (1981) . These antibodies appear to recognize the apoprotein of El since they bound well to both the 23K nonglycosylated precursor and the 25K glycosylated form. Site C(E1) was clearly distinct and recognized only by antibody 5B128.3. Definition of possibly overlapping epitopes A(E1) and B(E1) by antibodies 5B119.4,5A5.2, and"}
