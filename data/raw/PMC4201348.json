{"title": "Synthetic Antibodies with a Human Framework That Protect\nMice from Lethal Sudan Ebolavirus Challenge", "body": "Sequence\nand structural\nalignment of 16F6 (murine scaffold) with the vascular endothelial\ngrowth factor (VEGF)-specific synthetic antibody YADS1 (humanized\nscaffold) revealed marked similarity in the framework regions (Figure 1a and b).19,20 At the amino acid level,\nthere is 77% identity and 87% similarity in noncomplementarity-determining\nregion (CDR) segments, and examination of the structural alignment\nbetween the two antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) revealed strong homology\nof\nframework segments leading into the CDR loops. Superimposing the frameworks\nof the two Fabs and variable domains (Fvs) excluding CDR loops revealed\nRMSDs of 2.6 and 1.3 \u00c5 over 381 and 182 C\u03b1 atoms, respectively.\nAlthough there is marked variability in the loop conformations themselves,\nwe surmised that appropriate positioning of the beginning and end\nof the CDR loops would allow productive conformations in a humanized\nantibody containing the 16F6 CDR segments. YADS1 shares a framework\nwith many synthetic antibodies and is derived from the VH3-23 germline segment that has favorable characteristics such as\nhigh expression, stability, and mutability.20\u221222 This analysis\nsuggested that incorporation of 16F6-like recognition onto the YADS1\nscaffold might provide a successful strategy for creating SUDV antibodies\nbearing a humanized framework that are suitable for immunotherapy.\n\nWe designed and constructed a\n16F6 humanization library based on\na chimeric template where CDR segments from 16F6 were grafted onto\nthe YADS1 scaffold (Figure 1a). Restricted\ndiversification was permitted at positions near the CDR segments that\ndid not involve direct antigen contacts at the analogous sites in\n16F6 but had differing residue identity between 16F6 and YADS1. For\nexample, CDR-H1 position 29 (Ile in YADS1 but Phe in 16F6) was allowed\nto vary among the four residues Phe/Ile/Leu/Met, thus encoding both\nthe 16F6 and YADS1 residues as well as two others (Leu and Met) with\nsimilar properties. This randomization strategy was applied to several\npositions in CDR-H1, H2, and H3, as well as CDR-L1 and L3. In addition,\ntwo residues in CDR-L2 (53 and 56) differed among YADS1 (Tyr and Ser,\nrespectively) and 16F6 (both Thr), but the corresponding residues\nmade partial contacts to the antigen in 16F6. Therefore, these two\npositions were diversified with an NNK (N = A/T/C/G; K = G/T) codon allowing all 20 possible\namino acids. Full details for the randomization strategy are discussed\nin the Figure 1 caption. In total, 13 positions\nwere randomized with a theoretical diversity 4.5 \u00d7 108 at the DNA level and 4 \u00d7 107 at the protein level;\nthe library was produced with \u223c1010 unique members,\nallowing exhaustive sampling. The library was expressed as a bivalent\nFab fusion to the pIII gene as has been previously described for other\nsynthetic antibodies.20,21 This bivalent display format\nwas chosen to more accurately mimic the nature of an IgG, which would\nbe the preferred downstream therapeutic format.\n\nSix rounds of\nselection were performed against a soluble, recombinant\nSUDV GP (Boniface variant) that encompasses residues 33\u2013649\n(GPSUDV). This protein includes all major domains on GP1\nand GP2 except the transmembrane domain and C-terminal tail and is\nmostly trimeric in solution (data not shown). Previous work has demonstrated\nthat GP constructs expressed in mammalian cells but lacking the transmembrane\nsegment provide a suitable mimic of the prefusion spike for antibody\nselection, binding, and other structural studies.7,8,18,19 Several hundred\nclones were screened for binding to GPSUDV from output\npopulations of rounds 3\u20136 by monoclonal phage ELISA to identify\n38 clones representing 17 unique sequences (see Supporting Information). The distribution of amino acids among\nthese clones is represented in Figure 1c. To\ncompare requirements for recognition and stability, a parallel selection\nto determine display preferences was performed against anti-FLAG antibody\nM2; a FLAG epitope was included at the C-terminus of the phage displayed\nlight chain, and therefore any preferences for display will be evident\nwith this analysis.23,24 Comparison of amino acid composition\namong ELISA-positive clones from the functional selection (GPSUDV) and the display selection (M2) distribution revealed\nmoderate preferences for GPSUDV recognition at many positions\nbut strong preferences for the 16F6 residues at positions 29, 100a,\nand 100b of the heavy chain. Inspection of the 16F6 crystal structure\nsuggests that F29 and F100b likely support loop conformations, as\nthese residues are buried and participate in internal hydrophobic\ninteractions (see Supporting Information).19 Residue F100a participates in the\nstructural paratope, and therefore this residue is likely critical\nfor the intermolecular interface. In contrast, the 16F6 residue Ser\nat position 52a of CDR-H2 is less preferred compared with the YADS1\ncognate residue Pro. This preference is more evident in clones showing\nstronger neutralization efficacy (below). Since Pro has a strong effect\non loop conformations, the Pro at this position may serve to orient\nthe CDR-H2 loop toward favorable GP recognition in the human framework.\n\nThe panel of 17\nunique antibodies were produced as IgG1 molecules and characterized.\nAs a preliminary screen, the mAbs were tested for their ability to\ninhibit infection of a vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotyped with\nthe SUDV glycoprotein (VSV-GPSUDV) at 20 nM and 100 nM\n(Figure 2a and 2b).\nMurine 16F6 and the human EBOV-specific antibody KZ52 were included\nas positive and negative controls, respectively.25 Overall, the humanized mAbs had a range of activity against\nVSV-GPSUDV, with the most potent inhibiting at levels on-par\nwith murine 16F6 (\u223c90% inhibition at 20 nM and \u226595%\nat 100 nM). Notably, KZ52, an EBOV-specific human antibody, had no\nactivity even at 100 nM, consistent with previous reports of its strain\nspecificity.25,26 All 17 mAbs were also tested\nagainst VSV-GPEBOV but had no activity at 100 nM, and thus\nthe humanized variants maintained the specificity profile of the murine\n16F6 parent. This orthogonality in neutralization activity for 16F6\nand its humanized counterparts (monospecific for SUDV) and KZ52 (monospecific\nfor EBOV) is notable since the independent cocrystal structure complexes\nof 16F6 Fab-GPSUDV and KZ52 Fab-GPEBOV revealed\nthat both antibodies bind at similar locations on the glycoprotein.7,18,19 In fact, the structural epitopes\nof the two Fabs overlap by 10 residues, suggesting this region is\na shared neutralization epitope among the ebolaviruses.19 However, no broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb)\nagainst the filoviruses has yet been described. As a point of comparison,\nbNAbs against HIV-1 gp120 and influenza HA target conserved regions,\nand in these cases a compact structural epitope that focuses on conserved\nresidues is likely critical for broad potency.27\u221229\n\nEleven of the clones exhibited strong neutralization potential\n(\u223c95% or higher) at 100 nM; among these, E10 and F4 had favorable\nexpression yield, were well-behaved, and thus were carried forward\nfor further studies as representative examples. Dose-dependent inhibition\nprofiles against VSV-GPSUDV revealed IC50 values\nbelow 10 nM (Figure 2c). Both mAbs were tested\nagainst authentic SUDV under Biosafety level 4 (BSL4) conditions and\nfound to neutralize with IC50s below 4 nM (E10) and 8 nM\n(F4) (Figure 2d). When the SUDV neutralization\nassays were performed in the presence of 5% guinea pig complement,\nIC50s below 4 nM were observed in both cases. These results\nindicate that E10 and F4 have potent neutralization activity against\nSUDV GP-mediated cell entry. The fact that IC50s against\nSUDV were similar in the presence or absence of complement suggests\nthat the mechanism involves binding of GP and inhibition of cell entry,\nbut not opsonization or activation of the complement pathway. We performed\ncompetitive ELISA experiments to determine if 16F6, E10, and F4 shared\na common epitope. 16F6 was biotinylated (b16F6), and then the capacity\nof unbiotinylated 16F6 (positive control), E10, and F4 to inhibit\nb16F6 binding in a dose-specific manner was evaluated. As shown in\nFigure 3, all three unbiotinylated antibodies\ncompeted effectively with b16F6 with IC50 values below\n0.2 \u03bcM for 16F6 and F4 and \u223c0.6 \u03bcM for E10. These\nresults indicate that all three antibodies share an epitope and have\nrelatively comparable binding affinities to GPSUDV, with\nmodestly reduced affinity in the case of E10. Since library diversification\nfocused mostly on supporting CDR loop residues, rather than direct\ncontact sites, it is not surprising that affinities of the humanized\nclones were comparable or slightly decreased relative to the murine\n16F6 parent.\n\nTo explore the relationship between neutralization potency\nand\nbinding capacity, we performed ELISAs with several of the mAbs that\nhad varying neutralization potency (Figure 4). These can be grouped into strong neutralizers (E10, F4, 52D11,\n52F2, and 41F10), moderate neutralizers (41C6 and 31F8), and non-neutralizers\n(35E3 and 51E1). The half-maximal binding titer (EC50)\ncorrelated strongly with neutralization efficacy. The strong neutralizers\nhad EC50s ranging from 2.1 nM to 14.8 nM against GPSUDV, while moderate neutralizers 41C6 and 31F8 bound GPSUDV but did not exhibit saturation binding even at micromolar\nantibody concentrations. The non-neutralizers 35E3 and 51E1 did not\nhave appreciable binding activity. Notably, in all cases where binding\nactivity was observed, it was specific for GPSUDV over\nwells containing a negative control (2% nonfat dry milk, NFDM). All\n17 mAbs were also tested for binding to GPEBOV and found\nto have no activity, consistent with their monospecific neutralization\nactivity.\n\nAntibodies\nE10 and F4 were assessed for their ability to confer protection from\nSUDV challenge in mice. Although a mouse-adapted SUDV strain has been\ndeveloped, it is not lethal to immunocompetent mice. Here, the human-lethal\nwild-type SUDV virus was used to infect 4-week-old Type 1 interferon\n\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor knockout mice (Type 1 IFN\u03b1/\u03b2\nR\u2013/\u2013), and the ability of the mAbs to confer\npost-exposure protection was evaluated. The murine 16F6 and an EBOV-specific\nmAb (Z.6D8, ref (30)) were included as controls. Mice were provided with either three\ndoses (days \u22121 (pre-exposure), +1 and +4 (post-exposure); Figure 5a and b) or two post-exposure doses (days +1 and\n+4, Figure 6a and b) of 500 \u03bcg mAb via\nthe intraperitoneal route and challenged with a target dose of 1,000\nplaque forming units (pfu) of wild-type SUDV (day 0). Mice receiving\nthe SUDV-specific mAbs (16F6, E10, and F4) showed similar levels of\nprotection (80\u2013100% survival, Figures 5a and 6a), whereas those mice treated with\nan anti-EBOV specific mAb (Z.6D8) showed little or no protection.\nWhen mice received one dose of mAb prior to viral challenge (three-dose\nregime), no significant weight loss, which is a measure of clinical\nillness, was observed following challenge in the mice that received\nSUDV-specific antibodies, whereas the Z.6D8-treated control animals\nexhibited significant weight loss (maximal loss of 25%) (Figure 5b). In fact, a weight gain was observed with SUDV-specific\nantibody treatment, which is to be expected due to the fact that the\nmice were 4 weeks old when challenged and still maturing. When initiation\nof treatment in mice was delayed to day +1 (post-exposure two-dose\nregime), we observed no lethality when the SUDV-specific mAbs were\nprovided as treatment (Figure 6a). However,\nwith the delay in treatment, we observed a definite weight loss in\nthe antibody-treated mice that was absent in the day \u22121 (pre-exposure)\nthree-dose treatment scenario (Figure 6b).\n\nThirty-five days following the initial challenge,\nsurviving mice\n(those treated with SUDV-specific antibodies previously) were rechallenged\nwith 1,000 pfu wild-type SUDV with no additional antibody treatment\nto assess if memory cell immunity was generated after the first exposure\nand treatment (Figure 5c and d for the three-dose\ngroup, and Figure 6c and d for the post-exposure\ntwo-dose group). Mice were 9 weeks old when they were challenged unless\notherwise specified. Surviving mice from the three-dose group that\nreceived E10 and F4 mAbs had a nonstatistically significant trend\nof better rechallenge protection than mice receiving 16F6 (p < 0.094, Figure 5c). As a control\nto demonstrate that virus injected in rechallenge studies was capable\nof inducing morbidity/mortality, we included a na\u00efve cohort\nof 4-week-old mice that received the anti-EBOV specific Z.6D8 antibody.\nAs expected there was again little or no protection noted with this\ntreatment. Weight changes were not as apparent with the rechallenged\nmice in general because they were 9 weeks old and thus more developed\nat the time of the second infection (Figures 5d and 6d). When surviving mice from the two-dose\ntreatment were rechallenged at 9 weeks of age, all were protected\nwith little or no observable weight loss. During the initial challenge\nexperiment from this two-dose post-exposure treatment group, one of\nthe control Z.6D8 mice survived; this mouse also survived the rechallenge.\nTo gain additional insight, a group of na\u00efve, untreated 9-week-old\nmice were also included in the rechallenge experiment in Figure 6c. SUDV was not completely lethal to 9-week mice\n(survival was 80%), but the animals showed clinical signs of disease\nsuch as weight loss. When compared to 9-week mice that survived the\ninitial infection either with SUDV mAb treatment (16F6, E10, F4) or\nwithout (Z.6D8), it is apparent that the surviving mice have memory\nimmunity and show no weight loss as a result of infection (Figure 6d).\n\nHere we describe the\nin vitro and in vivo\nactivity of synthetic SUDV-specific antibodies containing a human\nframework. These mAbs show potent neutralization activity against\nboth pseudotyped and authentic viruses and confer protection and memory\nimmunity from infection in mice. Although therapeutic, antibody-mediated\nprotection against SUDV in larger animals has yet to be demonstrated,\nthe studies showing EBOV protection of NHPs,13\u221216 in many cases following post-exposure\ntreatments, suggest that SUDV antibody therapies should be explored\nand the mAbs reported herein represent viable candidates. Antibodies\nhave advantages of favorable serum half-life and are generally well-tolerated\nespecially if they contain human scaffolds; though there is only one\nFDA-approved antibody for antiviral infection (against respiratory\nsyncytial virus, RSV),31 a number of mAb\ntreatments are being considered for various viral diseases.32\u221234\n\nThe SUDV GP sequence is 56% identical to that of EBOV GP at\nthe amino acid level but differs in a number of structural and functional\naspects. The SUDV GP appears to be more dynamic, is more susceptible\nto proteolytic degradation, and electrostatically has more negative\nsurface charge character than does EBOV GP.17,19 Given these differences, it is not surprising that antibody-mediated\nneutralization requirements also differ, exemplified by the fact that\nKZ52 and 16F6 bind to similar overall positions on the prefusion GP\nspikes but have strain-specific activity (KZ52 for EBOV and 16F6 for\nSUDV); here we report that our humanized analogues retain this strain\nselectivity. SUDV has been responsible for numerous recent Ebola virus\noutbreaks, including one of the largest (Gulu district of Uganda in\n2000 with 425 reported cases and 224 deaths), and the only recorded\noutbreaks in 2012. Development of SUDV-specific mAbs is therefore\nimportant for both diagnostic and research purposes as well as for\npotential immunotherapies.\n\nThe synthetic gene for a template for\nconstruction of the 16F6 humanization library was cloned as a bivalent\nFab into phagemid for pIII display.35 The\ntemplate consisted of DNA encoding a chimera between the YADS1 framework\nwith 16F6 CDR segments and with 16F6 residue identity at the intended\npositions of randomization. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was\nused to incorporate diversity elements.36 The library DNA was electroporated into SS320 E. coli and library phage amplified according to standard protocols.36\n\nLibrary sorting was performed according\nto modified published protocols.8,35 Recombinant GPSUDV (residues 1\u2013649, with the first 32 residues comprising\nthe signal sequence that is removed during maturation) that was expressed\nin HEK293 cells served as the selection target was purchased from\nthe Protein Expression Laboratory, Frederick National Laboratory for\nCancer Research. Briefly, 0.5 \u03bcg/well of GPSUDV was\nimmobilized on 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates (Fisher Scientific, Nepean,\nON, Canada) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 8.0 for 14\u201316\nh at 4 \u00b0C. Wells were blocked with 5% NFDM (1.5 h, RT). Phage\npools from the 16F6 humanization library were cycled through six rounds\nof binding selection using the immobilized GPSUDV as a\ncapture target and 5% NFDM as a negative control. Stringency was increased\nthroughout the selection by decreasing the number of wells containing\nantigen and antigen loading concentrations with progressive rounds\nof selection. The output phage population from between rounds was\namplified in E. coli XL1-Blue cells in 2xYT broth\nsupplemented with 5 \u03bcg/mL tetracycline. Output phage population\nwas added to 5 mL cultures at OD600 of \u223c0.6 and\nshaken at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. M13-K07 helper phage were added (1010 infectious units (iu)/mL), and the culture was shaken at\n37 \u00b0C for an additional 1 h. The 5 mL culture was transferred\nto a 25 mL culture of 2xYT broth supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/mL\ncarbenicillin and 50 \u03bcg/mL kanamycin and allowed to shake at\n37 \u00b0C overnight (14\u201316 h). The cells were removed by centrifugation,\nand the amplified phage was precipitated by the addition of 3% (w/v)\nNaCl and 4% (w/v) PEG 8000. The phage was pelleted by centrifugation\nand suspended in PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 containing 0.5% BSA (PBT).\n\nOutput populations were screened for binding using monoclonal phage\nELISA. GPSUDV or M2 (0.5 \u03bcg/well) was immobilized\non wells, and wells were blocked with 5% NFDM as described above.\nAfter the sixth round of selection, clones from rounds 3\u20136\nwere grown overnight in 96-well deep well plates with 2xYT broth supplemented\nwith carbenicillin and M13K07 helper phage (1010 iu/mL).\nThe culture supernatants were applied directly to ELISA wells containing\nantigen (1 h, RT) to identify binding clones targeting GPSUDV. The phage solutions were decanted, and the wells were washed 4\u20136\ntimes with PBS + 0.05% Tween (PBST). To score binding, a solution\ncontaining 1/1000 dilution of anti-M13/horseradish peroxidase (HRP)\nconjugate (GE Heathcare, Piscataway, NJ) was added and allowed to\nbind for 45\u201360 min. The wells were again washed 4\u20136\ntimes with PBST and developed using 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine\nsubstrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The ELISA signal was measured\nafter quenching the signal with 0.5 M sulfuric acid and determining\nthe absorbance at 450 nm. Phage clones exhibiting phage ELISA signals\ntoward GPSUDV of at least 2-fold higher than toward 5%\nNFDM were subjected to DNA sequence analysis.\n\nThe variable domain\nDNA for each phage clone was amplified by PCR, digested, and subcloned\ninto pMAZ-IgL and pMAZ-IgH vectors.37 Vectors\nfor the heavy and light chain were transfected into HEK293F cells\n(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) using 2 \u03bcg/mL linear polyethylenimine\n(PEI), molecular weight 25,000 Da according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Cell cultures were incubated\nat 37 \u00b0C for 5\u20136 days post-transfection. The cell cultures\nwere centrifuged, and the supernatants were applied to a protein-A\naffinity column (\u223c2 mL packed beads per 600 mL culture) (Pierce,\nThermoScientific, Rockford, IL). IgG proteins were eluted with 100\nmM glycine, pH 2.0 and neutralized with 2 M Tris, pH 7.5. The eluent\nwas dialyzed into PBS, pH 7.4 and the IgG protein was concentrated.\n\nNeutralization assays were performed using vesicular\nstomatitis virus pseudotyped to display the GP from either SUDV or\nEBOV in place of its native G glycoprotein (VSV-GPSUDV or\nVSV-GPEBOV, respectively). The viral genome encodes an\nenhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), and infection is scored\nby counting fluorescent cells after infection. The protocol for VSV-GP\nproduction has been described elsewhere.38 Briefly, the virus-containing supernatants were harvested and concentrated\nby pelleting through a 10% sucrose cushion. Virus stocks were titered\nby infecting African Green Monkey kidney (Vero) cells with serial\ndilutions and counting eGFP-positive cells by fluorescence microscopy.\nVSV-GP was used to infect Vero cells at approximate multiplicities\nof infection of 0.1\u20131.0 in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\nmedium (DMEM) containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo Scientific,\nWaltham, MA), such that 20\u2013200 cells were infected per well.\nVero cell monolayers consisting of \u223c7.5 \u00d7 104 cells/well in a 48-well plate were incubated for 14\u201316 h\nwith pseudotyped virus that had been preincubated with dilutions of\nthe IgG. Infection was scored by manually counting eGFP-positive cells\nunder a fluorescence microscope, 14\u201316 h after initial exposure.\n\nDilutions of the antibody of interest were made in a sterile 96-well\nplate (Costar/Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY) in Eagle Minimum\nEssential Media (EMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) supplemented\nwith 5% FBS. In a sterile 6-well plate (Costar/Corning Incorporated,\nCorning, NY), 125 \u03bcL of authentic EBOV or SUDV diluted to 1200\npfu/mL was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37\n\u00b0C for 1 h. Virus was added to a well containing media alone\n(no antibody) as a control for 100% infection. Vero-E6 cells were\nexposed to 100 \u03bcL of the virus/antibody mixture and incubated\nat 37 \u00b0C for an additional 1 h. During this time, the plates\nwere gently rocked every 15 min to ensure homogeneity and prevent\ndrying. After 1 h of incubation, 2 mL of primary overlay (EMEM with\n10% FBS and 1% Gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with 1% SeaKem\nME agarose (Lonza, Cohasset, MN)) was added to each well, and the\nplates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 6 days. On Day 7 post-exposure\nto virus, neutral red solution (EMEM with 10% FBS and 1% gentamicin\nwith 5% neutral red (Gibco/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) was added\nto all cell-containing wells, and cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C\novernight. Infection was scored by counting the number of plaques\nper well, using the number of plaques on the control well (no antibody)\nas 100% infection.\n\nPRNT assays with complement were performed\nusing Low-Tox Guniea pig complement (Cedarlane). The lyophilized complement\nwas resuspended with 1 mL of ice-cold water and then diluted 1:18\nin ice-cold PBS and filter sterilized. This complement mixture was\nincubated in a 1:1 ratio with 65 \u03bcL of 2,400 pfu/mL virus stock\n37 \u00b0C for 1 h (this gave a final viral titer of 1,200 pfu/mL).\nVero-E6 cells were exposed to 100 \u03bcL of the virus/antibody/complement\nmixture at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h with gentle rocking every 15 min. The\nremaining steps were identical to the PRNT assay without complement\nas described above.\n\nThe target proteins\nwere directly immobilized\nonto 96-well Maxisorp plates (GPSUDV and GPEBOV = 0.5 \u03bcg/well) by incubating in PBS pH 8.0 for 14\u201316\nh at 4 \u00b0C. PBS, pH 7.4, containing 5% NFDM was used to block\nthe wells after target immobilization (incubation for 60\u201390\nmin at RT). Negative control plates were coated with 5% NFDM only.\nIgGs were diluted into PBT, applied to the wells, and incubated at\nRT for 1 h. The plates were washed with PBST and incubated for 45\u201360\nmin with Protein A/HRP antibody conjugate (1:1000 dilution in PBT).\nThe wells were washed 4\u20136 times with PBST and developed as\ndescribed above. The absorbance at 450 nm was determined. The data\nwere fit to standard four-parameter logistic equations using Graphpad\nPrism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). The half-maximal binding\ntiters (EC50) were obtained from the inflection point in\nthe curves.\n\nCompetition ELISAs were performed as previously\ndescribed.8 16F6 was biotinylated (b16F6)\nusing a NHS-PEG4-BIOTIN labeling kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford,\nIL) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. GPSUDV was immobilized on 96-well Maxisorp plates (Corning Incorporated,\nCorning, NY) at a concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg/well. b16F6 was diluted\nto 12 \u03bcg/mL in PBST buffer with or without varying amounts of\nthree unbiotinylated competitors, 16F6, F4, and E10. The mixtures\nof b16F6 with or without competitors were applied to the wells and\nincubated at RT for 1 h. The plates were washed with PBST, and then\nhorseradish peroxidase/streptavidin conjugate (1:1000 dilution in\nPBST buffer) was added and incubated for 45 min. The plates were washed\nwith PBST, developed with TMB substrate, and quenched with 0.5 M H2SO4. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured.\n\nMale and female Type 1 IFN\n\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor knockout mice (Type 1 IFN\u03b1/\u03b2\nR\u2013/\u2013) purchased from Jackson Laboratory (4\u201314\nweeks of age) were utilized in these experiments. Mice were treated\nvia the intraperitoneal route (ip) with 500 \u03bcg of indicated\nmAb at either day \u22121, +1, and +4 or 500 \u03bcg of indicated\nmAb at day +1 and +4 and challenged ip with a target dose of 1,000\nplaque forming units (pfu) of wild-type SUDV. Surviving mice were\nrechallenge IP with target dose 1000 pfu of wild-type SUDV with no\ntreatment provided. Following all challenges mice were monitored daily\nfor morbidity and mortality."}
