{"title": "Utilisation of and Attitude towards Traditional and Complementary Medicine among Ebola Survivors in Sierra Leone", "body": "Traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) can be defined as a set of healthcare modalities (local or imported products and practices) that are historically located outside the dominant model of healthcare [1,2]. In Africa, T&CM may include traditional healthcare products and practices (herbal medicine or products and traditional bone setting) and imported complementary medicine (acupuncture and massage therapy, yoga naturopathy) [3,4,5]. T&CM use in Africa is considered a public health issue primarily due to its widespread use alone or alongside conventional medicine, with most studies showing more than half the population using T&CM [4]. In Sierra Leone, high use of T&CM, especially herbal medicines use, has been observed among pregnant women [6], lactating mothers [7], hypertensive patients [8], infertile women [9], healthcare students [10] and for the treatment of malaria in children [11] and adults [12].\n\nThe 2014\u20132016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa was considered to be the most significant outbreak in history with EVD infecting 28,616 people and resulting in 11,310 deaths [13]. The outbreak also produced the highest number of survivors in the three most affected countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. As of the 12 May 2016, the global estimate of EVD survivors was approximately 10,000 [14]. This number will increase as EVD outbreaks continue in other countries such in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) [15]. Survivors of EVD outbreaks experience a myriad of post-ebola physical and psychological complications, which include musculoskeletal pain, ocular and auditory problems, depression, anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, as well as stigma and discrimination from the community [16,17,18]. Ebola survivors are known to seek conventional care to address their myriad health challenges [19,20] and there is evidence of EVD survivors employing local cultural practices (which encompass T&CM) in their management of EVD transmission and prevention [21,22,23]. However, no research to date has evaluated the frequency and reasons for T&CM use among Ebola survivors.\n\nTwo dominant sets of interpretations have been proposed to help explain the reasons why many people around the globe use T&CM. The first set of interpretations can loosely be referred to as pull factors, which focused on those features, and factors around T&CM that are attractive to users (pull factors). These pull factors regarding T&CM use that have been identified in the contemporary literature across sub-Saharan Africa suggest that people tend to be attracted to T&CM due to its perceived low cost, availability, congruence with their individual\u2019s cultural and religious beliefs, patient sense of autonomy over their health and their perceived safety and efficacy of T&CM products [4]. The second interpretation relates to people who are dissatisfied with what conventional medicine can offer (push factors). The contemporary literature across sub-Saharan Africa suggests that people seek T&CM due to disenchantment with conventional medicine, the negative attitude of healthcare providers to cultural traditions (including T&CM), drug availability, long distance to and inequity in accessing health facilities as well as long waiting times [4]. In addition, beliefs related to safety, efficacy, holism and the sense of control of one\u2019s health have been identified as possible predictors of T&CM use among different illness groups outside of Africa [24,25,26,27].\n\nThe very few studies that have explored beliefs and attitudes towards the use of T&CM in Sierra Leone have been restricted to healthcare students (showing generally positive attitudes towards T&CM amongst this sub-group) [10,28]. Given that unpublished data has suggested Ebola survivors are likely to seek T&CM healthcare in Sierra Leone to help meet their healthcare needs [29], it is important to examine Ebola survivors\u2019 general beliefs regarding T&CM and how these beliefs are linked with their decision to use T&CM. Such information is important, as it will help healthcare providers and policymakers to understand better Ebola survivors\u2019 use and motivations for using T&CM, which will help minimise risks to patient care and invariably maximize patient care outcomes. These studies may also serve to identify \u2018push\u2019 and \u2018pull\u2019 factors that can help design more responsive health services for Ebola survivors. However, to date, no study in Sierra Leone or across Africa has evaluated Ebola survivors\u2019 attitudes towards the use of T&CM. To fill this significant research gap, our study evaluates Ebola survivors\u2019 attitudes towards the use of T&CM in Sierra Leone drawing upon a nationally representative sample.\n\nA descriptive nationwide questionnaire survey employing a cross-sectional study design was administered to Ebola survivors who were at least 18 years old and experiencing post-Ebola sequelae in Sierra Leone. The study was undertaken between January and August 2018. Ebola survivors who were unable to accurately provide information or participate in the study due to physical and psychological conditions such as memory loss, hearing loss, high fever and bleeding or those experiencing acute emotional distress that would put the research and other participants at risk were excluded.\n\nWe collected data from the four geographic regions of Sierra Leone (Western Area, Northern province, Southern province and Eastern province). We then purposefully selected five districts to cover all four geographic regions of the country. Figure 1 shows the location of the five districts in Sierra Leone. The five districts include western area urban and western area rural districts (both in the Western area), Bo district (Southern province), Kenema district (Eastern province) and Bombali district (Northern province). We chose these five districts based on the epidemiological profile of the total confirmed Ebola cases and because they are host to the highest number of Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone. We then randomly selected Ebola survivors in each of the five districts based on proportional representation using the national list of registered Ebola survivors obtained from the Sierra Leone Association of Ebola survivors (SLAES). Survivors who were randomly selected were approached to participate in the study via telephone. The required sample of 351 Ebola survivors was determined using the formula for cross-sectional study (N = z2pq/d2), with the perceived prevalence (p) assumed to be 50% since no previous research on T&CM use among Ebola survivors has been conducted so far. To increase the statistical power, we aimed to recruit 400 Ebola survivors.\n\nEbola survivors were questioned about their use of T&CM (product and practitioners) since their discharge from an Ebola treatment centre for the management of common post-ebola sequelae. The T&CM products and practices considered in our study included herbal medicine, traditional medicine practice (traditional bone-setting), prayer/faith healing and massage. The T&CM products and practices considered in our study were informed by the results of previous research on T&CM use conducted in Sierra Leone [6,7,8,9,12,28] and across Africa [4].\n\nEbola survivors were asked whether they agree or disagree with the following statements: T&CM has fewer side effects than conventional medicine (CM); T&CM is more natural than CM; T&CM promotes a holistic approach to health; T&CM boosts my immune system/resistance; T&CM gives me more control over my health/body; knowledge about the evidence of T&CM is important to me as a patient; my personal experience of the effectiveness of T&CM is more important than clinical evidence; CAM needs to be tested for safety and side-effects; and T&CM is a better preventative measure than conventional medicine. Survivors were also questioned as to whether they perceived T&CM practitioners as spending a longer time in consultation with and providing more support to their patient than medical doctors. Further, we asked survivors about whether they find it easier to talk to a T&CM practitioner compared to a medical doctor and whether they believe medical doctors should be able to advise patients about T&CM.\n\nEthical approval was obtained from the University of Technology Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (UTS-HREC-ETH17-2080, Date of Approval = 19 April 2018) and the Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee (Date of Approval = 17 May 2018). The selected sample of Ebola survivors was approached to take part in the study via telephone during which the scope and rationale, as well as the option to opt out of the study, were explained. Initial verbal consent was obtained via telephone. For those who gave verbal consent, an arrangement was made either to fill the questionnaire or to be interviewed at their homes, courtyard or the regional Ebola survivor office. A participant information sheet that explains the purpose and scope of the study, as well as the option to opt out, was given or read (for illiterate participants) participants before asked to sign or thumbprint the consent form. Survivors signing or thumb printing the consent form was interpreted as their willingness to participate. Survivors who signed or thumbed printed (for illiterate participants) the consent form were then given the questionnaire to fill or to be interviewed. Data were collected from Ebola survivors using self-administered or interviewer-administered (for illiterate participants) formats. Among those who consented to participate in the study, the majority filled the questionnaire in the presence of a data collector or were interviewed by a data collector at the Ebola survivor regional office. Additionally, some Ebola survivors filled the questionnaire alone in their homes at their own time and later sent the filled questionnaires to their regional offices. In addition, some Ebola survivors filled the questionnaire in the presence of a data collector or were interviewed at their homes or the village courtyard. We collected our data between May and August 2018.\n\nData analysis was conducted using SPSS Statistics version 24. Chi-square or Fischer exact two-tailed tests were used to determine the association between each of the attitude statements and T&CM use. We employed a backward stepwise binary logistic model to determine the attitude statements that are significant predictors of T&CM use. All attitude statements were entered into the model, and a backward stepwise elimination process was conducted until we obtained the most parsimonious model. Ebola survivors\u2019 age, sex, marital status, educational background, financial status, religious affiliation, perceived health status, place of residence, duration (months) since discharged from ETC and presence of chronic disease prior to being infected with Ebola were entered into the model as potential cofounders. The probability value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.\n\nOf the 400 Ebola survivors invited to participate, 376 consented, of which 358 fully completed the questionnaire. Table 1 shows the demographic and health-related characteristics between users and non-users of T&CM among Ebola survivors. More than half Ebola survivors were between the ages of 18\u201334 years (n = 194, 54.2%) and close to two thirds were females (n = 223, 62.3%). Moreover, close to three-quarters perceived their current health to be fair/poor (n = 262, 73.2%).\n\nTable 2 shows that close to half of the survivors (n = 163, 45.5%) had used T&CM since their discharge from an Ebola treatment centre. Moreover, less than a quarter of survivors (n = 62, 17.3%) used both conventional medicine and T&CM concurrently. Herbal medicine (n = 136, 83.4%) is the most common type of T&CM used among T&CM users.\n\nTable 3 shows the attitudes towards use of T&CM by Ebola survivors. More than two thirds of participants (n = 257, 71.8%) believe that T&CM is \u2018natural\u2019. Approximately three-quarters of survivors are of the view that T&CM needs to be tested for safety/side-effects and more than half (n = 213, 59.5%) report knowledge about the evidence of T&CM as important to them. In addition, the majority of Ebola survivors (n = 313, 87.4%) believe medical doctors should be able to advise patients about T&CM. On the other hand, more than half (n = 218, 60.9%) did not perceive T&CM as having fewer side effects than conventional medicine. Furthermore, more than two thirds (n = 250, 69.8%) did not perceive T&CM as promoting a holistic approach to health. In addition, less than one quarter (n = 73, 20.4%) perceived a T&CM practitioner as providing more support to their patients than a medical doctor.\n\nTable 4 outlines the association between T&CM use and individual attitudes of Ebola survivors. Attitude statements such as T&CM is more natural than conventional medicine (p < 0.001), T&CM boosts my immune system/resistance (p < 0.001), my personal experience of the effectiveness of T&CM is more important than clinical evidence (p < 0.001), T&CM gives me more control over my health/body (p < 0.001), I find it easier to talk to a T&CM practitioner than a medical doctor (p < 0.001) and T&CM has fewer side-effects than conventional medicine (p < 0.001) are associated with T&CM use. No statistical difference was observed between T&CM users and non-users for the remaining attitude statements.\n\nBackward stepwise logistic regression (Table 5) found that survivors who agreed that T&CM boosts their immune system/resistance were 3.89 (95%CI: 1.57\u20139.63, p = 0.003) times more likely to use T&CM than those that disagreed. Ebola survivors who agreed with the statement that T&CM has fewer side effects than CM were 5.03 (95%CI: 1.92\u201313.19, p = 0.001) times more likely to use T&CM than those who disagreed. Ebola survivors were 13.72 (95%CI: 6.10\u201330.84, p < 0.001) times more likely to use T&CM if they considered important their personal experience of the effectiveness of T&CM than clinical evidence. In addition, survivors who believe that T&CM gives them more control over their health/body were 4.15 (95%CI: 1.74\u20139.89, p = 0.001) times more likely to be T&CM users as opposed to those who disagreed with this statement.\n\nOne limitation of our study is that the data collected is self-reported, which may reflect recall bias. Moreover, our findings are not necessarily representative of the perceptions and experiences of Ebola survivors in other countries. Also, due to the cross-sectional nature of our study, a cause-effect relationship cannot be deduced from our results. In addition, we excluded Ebola survivors in our study with conditions that limit their ability to accurately provide information or participate in the study and may put the research and other participants at risk. Although the demographic characteristics of Ebola survivors excluded are similar to those included in our study, those excluded may have held different views with regards to the attitude statements considered in our study.\n\nFindings from our study have provided insights into the reasons for T&CM use among Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone. Ebola survivors who are T&CM users value safety, personal experience of effectiveness, patient autonomy and the need to boost the body\u2019s immunity when using T&CM. Such reasons for T&CM use among Ebola survivors are useful to conventional health providers, in improving practitioner-patient communication regarding T&CM and identify survivors\u2019 beliefs about T&CM that might be targets for public education among Ebola survivors by policymakers and health providers."}
