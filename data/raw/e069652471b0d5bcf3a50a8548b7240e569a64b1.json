{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Kidney disease is associated with in-hospital death of patients with COVID-19 Kidney disease is associated with in-hospital death of patients with COVID-19", "body": "In December 2019, a series of unknown origin cases of acute respiratory illness occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. 1-2 High-throughput sequencing showed that the disease was caused by named \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus Although diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure were the main features of COVID-19 4 , the involvement of other organs needed to be explored. After lung infection, the virus may enter the blood, accumulate in kidney and cause damage to resident renal cells. Indeed, COVID-19 RNA was found in the plasma of 15% of patients by real-time polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR). 4 Of note, it is reported showed that 6.7% of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) developed acute kidney injury (AKI), and the mortality of those with AKI was 91.7%. 5 Thus, understanding how the kidney is affected by SARS-CoV-2 is urgently warranted.\n\nIn this large prospective cohort study of COVID-19 adult patients in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches and more than 4000 beds, which was designated for critical COVID-19 cases by local government, we aimed to determine the prevalence of AKI in patients with COVID 19 disease, and to define the association between markers of kidney disease and death in patients infected with COVID 19.\n\nA total of 701 patients were included in our study. Table 1 shows the COVID-19 patients' clinical features. Median age was 63 years, and 52.4% were males. Median duration from illness onset to admission was 10 days. 42.6% patients were reported having at least one comorbidity. 2.0%, 1.9%, 33.4%, 14.3%, 4.6% patients reported having chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes and tumor. Mean lymphocyte count was 0.9 \u00b1 0.5\u00d710 9 /L, below the lower limit of normal. Most patients had elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (83.0%) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (81.6%), but elevated levels of procalcitonin were rare (9.8%). Coagulopathies were common in COVID-19 patients.\n\nIn addition, mean serum lactose dehydrogenase (377 \u00b1 195 U/L) was increased, especially in those with high baseline serum creatinine levels ( Table 2) .\n\nOn admission, serum creatinine and BUN were elevated in 14.4% and 13.1% of the patients, respectively. 13.1% patients had estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73m 2 . During hospitalization, peak serum creatinine was 91 \u00b1 67 \u03bcmol/L; 43.9% patients had proteinuria, and relatively fewer patients (26.7%) had hematuria ( Table 2) . On admission, urethral catheterization was done in only 9.8% patients, some of whom were due to the application of invasive mechanical ventilation. This indicated that the impact of catheterization on abnormal urinary analysis on admission was small.\n\nCompared to patients with normal serum creatinine, those who entered the hospital with an elevated serum creatinine were predominantly male and older, and were more severely ill (Table 1) . Moreover, patients with elevated baseline serum creatinine demonstrated a higher leukocyte count and lower lymphocyte and platelet counts. Coagulation pathway abnormalities, including prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and higher D-dimer, were more common in patients with elevated baseline serum creatinine. The percentage of patients with increased procalcitonin, and the levels of aspartate aminotransferase and lactose dehydrogenase were also higher in patients with elevated baseline serum creatinine. Of note, the gap between peak and baseline serum creatinine was also much greater in patients with elevated baseline serum creatinine ( Table 2) .\n\nDuring hospitalization, AKI occurred in 5.1% patients. The incidence of AKI was significantly higher in patients with elevated baseline serum creatinine (11.9%) than in patients with normal baseline values (4.0%), (Table 1 and Figure 1 ).\n\nIn-hospital death occurred in 16.1% of patients. The median time to death was 6 (inter quartile range, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] days. The incidence of in-hospital death in the patients with elevated baseline serum creatinine was 33.7%, which was significantly higher than in those with normal baseline serum creatinine (13.2%) ( Table 1) .\n\nKaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly higher in-hospital death rate for patients with kidney abnormalities, including elevated baseline serum creatinine, elevated baseline BUN, proteinuria, hematuria and AKI (P<0.001) ( Figure 2 ).\n\nUnivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age above 65, male and severe COVID-19 disease were associated with in-hospital death. In addition, the kidney disease indicators mentioned above were also associated with in-hospital death (Table   3 ). After adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, comorbidities and lymphocyte count, proteinuria of any degree, hematuria of any degree, elevated baseline BUN, and serum creatinine, peak serum creatinine > 133\u03bcmol/L, and AKI over stage 2 were all associated with in-hospital death ( Figure 3 ).\n\nThe medications before hospitalization were not available, thus we only summarized the medications during hospitalization in Table 4 . On the first day of admission, antivirus (73.0%), antibiotics (71.0%), and glucocorticoid (36.9%) were the three most common medications among patients with COVID-19, and the percentage of treatment with antivirus (p=0.041) and glucocorticoid (p=0.006) was significant higher in patients with AKI. However, when it comes to specific antivirus, including arbidol, ganciclovir, interferon, lopinavir and ritonavir, oseltamivir and ribavirin, there is no significant difference between patients with AKI and those without. Throughout the hospitalization, the percentage of medications increased, especially for antivirus, diuretic and glucocorticoid. In addition, the percentage of diuretic during hospitalization were significant higher in patients with AKI than those without (72.2% versus 6.2%, p<0.001).\n\nIn this large prospective cohort study conducted in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches in Wuhan, China, we observed a high prevalence of kidney disease in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. More than 40% among them had evidence of kidney disease, with elevated serum creatinine and BUN values in over 13% among them.\n\nStrikingly, the presence of kidney disease was associated with greater in-hospital mortality.\n\nMultiple organ involvement including the liver, gastrointestinal tract and kidney have been reported during the course of SARS in 2003 6 and very recently in patients with COVID-19. 7 One possible explanation of the high prevalence of kidney involvement at hospital admission is that some among the COVID-19 patients had a past history of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Such patients have a pro-inflammatory state with functional defects in innate and adaptive immune cell populations 8 , and are known to have a higher risk for upper respiratory tract infection 9 and pneumonia. 10 Of note, the median time period between the first symptoms and signs of COVID-19 and hospital admission was slightly more than a week in our study. An alternative explanation is that many COVID-19 patients could not be admitted in the very early stage of disease outbreak because of the acutely increasing, large number of patients and limited availability of hospital beds in Wuhan. Earlier admission to hospital might have helped to prevent disease spread and deterioration. This is the first study showing an association between kidney involvement and poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. We found that patients with elevated baseline serum creatinine were more likely to be admitted to ICU and to undergo mechanical ventilation, suggesting that kidney disease on admission represented a higher risk of deterioration. It has been reported previously that kidney injury was associated with an increased risk of death in patients with H1N1 and SARS. 5, 11 In our study, indicators of kidney involvement at admission were associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death even after adjustment for potential confounders. This AKI results from an abrupt loss of kidney function, strongly associated with increased mortality and morbidity. 12 We found that patients with elevated serum creatinine were more likely to develop AKI during hospitalization, which is consistent with study in SARS. 5 It is therefore important to increase the awareness of AKI in those who entered the hospital with an elevated serum creatinine. In our cohort the detection rate of AKI in COVID-19 patients was 5.1%, in keeping with recent reports of small sample size 1, 4, 7, 13 and much higher than the 0.5% of a large observational study. 14 This may be explained by an extremely high proportion of severely sick patients in a previous case series and only 15.7% in the large observational study. In our cohort study, 42.7% patients were severely ill, and this may explain the higher detection rate of AKI in clinic practice in Wuhan. Importantly, the present method of detecting AKI is mainly based on acute changes in serum creatinine and the frequency of serum creatinine tests has a substantial impact on detection rate. 15 In a nationwide cross-sectional survey of hospitalize adult patients in China, the detection rate of AKI was only 0.99% by KDIGO criteria. 16 After adjusting for the frequency of serum creatinine, determinations the incidence of AKI in Chinese hospitalized adults rose to 11.6%. 17 Thus, in order to improve early detection of kidney injury, more frequent serum creatinine measurements should be performed in patients with COVID-19.\n\nThe etiology of kidney disease involvement in COVID-19 patients is likely to be multifactorial. First, the novel coronavirus may exert direct cytopathic effects on kidney tissue. This is supported by the detection of PCR fragments of coronavirus in blood and urine in 2003 SARS 18 and COVID-19 patients. 4 Recently, it has been shown that the novel coronavirus uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2(ACE2) as a cell entry receptor, which is identical to that of the SARS-CoV as reported in 2003. 19 Recent human tissue RNA-seq data demonstrated thatACE2 expression in urinary organs (kidney) was nearly 100-fold higher than in respiratory organs (lung). 20 Therefore, the kidney disease may be caused by coronavirus entering kidney cells through an ACE2 dependent pathway. Second, deposition of immune complexes of viral antigen or virus-induced specific immunological effector mechanisms (specific T lymphocyte or antibody) may damage the kidney. However, kidney microscopy specimens from SARS patients were reported to show a normal glomerular aspect and absence of electron-dense deposits. 5 This is not in support of an active immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. Clearly, potential pathological kidney changes in COVID-19 patients require further study. Third, virus-induced cytokines or mediators might exert indirect effects on renal tissue, such as hypoxia, shock, and rhabdomyolysis. In fact, some of the 2009 H1N1 patients had mild to moderate elevations of serum creatine kinase. 21 In keeping with this observation, 138 patients with COVID-19 disease, who were admitted in ICU, showed a tendency towards increased creatine kinase levels, 13 and the patients with kidney involvement in our study tended to have increased creatine kinase levels as well.\n\nWe compared the medications on the first day of admission and during the hospitalization in patients with AKI and non-AKI. We found that patients with AKI were more likely to have higher proportion of glucocorticoid and lower proportion of antiviral drugs and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors treatment on admission. The difference in the use of glucocorticoid may be explained by the condition of patients with AKI that was more severe , thus physicians tended to use glucocorticoid in the most critically ill patients, even if there is a controversy on the use of glucocorticoid in COVID-19 patients. 22, 23 However, the oral antiviral drugs, including arbidol (umifenovir), oseltamivir, lopinavir and ritonavir, were preferred in moderate patients on admission. Given that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the safety and potential effects of RAAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19 should be carefully considered. 24 Even though this study included a large number of patients from a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, it has several limitations. First, an accurate baseline serum creatinine was not available, which may have led to an underestimation of AKI or erroneous associations. Second, although we attempted to adjust for many confounders, other unmeasured or unknown confounders might have played a role.\n\nThird, clinical data of patient after discharge was lacking, so we could not assess COVID-19 effects on long-term outcomes. The precise impact of COVID-19 on kidney structure and function, and the incidence of CKD in these patients requires further investigation.\n\nIn conclusion, the prevalence of kidney disease in patients with COVID-19 disease hospitalized in Wuhan, China was high. After adjustment for confounders, kidney disease on admission and AKI during hospitalization were associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death. Clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney disease in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 disease. Early detection and effective intervention of kidney involvement may help to reduce deaths of patients with COVID-19 disease.\n\nAll consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to Tongji hospital, Tongji medical college, Huazhong university of science and technology, from January 28 to February 11, 2020 were enrolled. Tongji hospital, located in Wuhan, Hubei Province, the major endemic area of COVID-19, is one of the main tertiary teaching hospitals. Tongji hospital was assigned responsibility for the treatments of severe COVID-19 patients by Wuhan government on January 31 th . All patients who were enrolled in this study were diagnosed COVID-19 positive according to the guidance provided by the Chinese National Health Commission. The diagnosis criteria was as follow, clinical diagnosis criteria: i) fever or respiratory symptoms; ii) leukopenia or lymphopenia; iii) the computerized tomography (CT) scan showed radiographic abnormalities in lung.\n\nThose with two or more clinical diagnosis criteria and a positive result to high-throughput sequencing or RT-PCR assay were diagnosed COVID-19 positive.\n\nPediatric patients are excluded. Patients with a history of maintenance dialysis or renal transplantation were also excluded from the study. Clinical outcomes were monitored up to February 29, 2020, the final date of follow-up.\n\nThe demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory data and medications were extracted from electronic medical records. Laboratory data consisted of complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, examination of hemostasis parameters, measurement of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase serum levels, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.\n\nThe thresholds of these measures were given by our laboratory. The upper limit of normal serum creatinine in men and women were 104 \u03bcmol/L and 84 \u03bcmol/L, respectively. The upper limit of normal BUN in men with age<60, 60 to 80, >80 were 8.0, 9.5 and 8.3 mmol/L, respectively. The upper limit of normal BUN in women with age<60, 60 to 80, >80 were 7.5, 8.8 and 8.3 mmol/L, respectively. The data were reviewed by a trained team of physicians. eGFR was calculated with Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. 22 The date of disease onset was defined as the day when the first symptom was noticed.
