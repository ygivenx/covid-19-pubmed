{"title": "", "body": "Globally, health care waste (HCW) is a highly visible, emotional and political issue (Brody, 1993) . South Africa is no exception. Many disadvantaged communities live alongside landfills, where 'picking' may be their only form of livelihood (Khan, 1998) . If, as has been claimed, that half of the South African biomedical waste stream is unaccounted for, largely as a result of improper separation and illegal dumping (Anonymous, 1993) , this then has important consequences for 'pickers' at landfill sites. Considering that there are almost 27,000 potential sources of HCW (which appear not to include veterinary waste) in South Africa (Baldwin and Ball, 2000) , cognisance must be taken of the hazards of illegal and inappropriate disposal of such waste.\n\nIn the United Kingdom (UK), veterinary waste is classified with other HCW as clinical waste and three important laws govern its management: the Control of Pollution Act, the Health and Safety at Work Act and the Environmental Protection Act (EPA) (British Veterinary Association (BVA), 1991 (BVA), , 1992 . In April 1992, the 'Duty of Care' principle was added to the EPA, placing responsibility on all producers of clinical waste to not only handle and store waste safely on their own premises, but to ensure its safe and legal disposal. In the event of a contractor not dealing with the waste appropriately, the practice producing the waste would also then be liable. As a clinical waste generator, a veterinarian must show, in such a circumstance, that all of the correct procedures were followed, including verifying the waste contractor and providing transfer documents indicating types and volumes of waste collected (BVA, 1992) . A similar principle operates in the United States of America (USA) in the form of a federal environmental law in which generators retain liability for waste from ''cradle to grave'' (Brody, 1993) . Guidelines in the Code of Federal Conduct govern waste storage, handling and transport (Pratt, 1994) .\n\nThe situation in South Africa is somewhat different. Although, at the time of the study (2001) (2002) (2003) , legislation, regulations and guidelines with inferred application to veterinary practices existed, only recently has veterinary waste been included in the definition of HCW. Rigby's (2002) claim of no statutory definition of veterinary waste in South Africa confirms this. While the Veterinary and Para-veterinary Professions Act (RSA, 2002) provides guidance for the profession, it requires only that practitioners follow the minimum requirements of a practice (not specified in the Act) and that the use of medicines is controlled by the Medicines and Substances Control Act (RSA, 1965) . Additional but limited direction is provided in the South African Veterinary Council's (SAVC) Code of Conduct for the Practice of Veterinarians (2004), such as the hygienic disposal of soiled dressings and animal tissue and the storage and disposal of carcasses to prevent decomposition on the premises (http://www.savc.co.za).\n\nAlthough there were 871 registered veterinary practices in South Africa in 2001 (SAVC, 2002) , little was (and still is) known about the types and volumes of veterinary waste generated, or about its storage and final disposal. Taking cognisance of Nowlan's (1997) classification of veterinary waste (Table 1) , clearly precautions need to be taken regarding its management. Nowlan's (1997) classification is similar to that for HCW recognised by the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA, 2002) , which advocated the South African Bureau of Standard's (SABS, 0248:1993) Code of Practice for the Handling and Disposal of Waste within Health Care Facilities (which specifically did not include veterinary practices). Although contaminated waste from veterinary practices does not carry the risk of HIV infection, over 130 potential zoonoses are encountered in veterinary practices (Republic of South Africa (RSA, 1993a) . Recent global outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Avian Bird 'Flu and Foot and Mouth Disease should alert authorities to the potential dangers of contaminated animal waste. Fortunately, the revised 1993 SABS guidelines (Standards South Africa, SANS 10248:2004) now include veterinary practices, clinics and hospitals as health care facilities.\n\nManagers of these facilities must now comply with the minimum requirements applicable to all generators of HCW (e.g., correct and labelled separation at source, waste documentation, staff training, developing a waste management plan and ensuring compliance regarding final disposal).\n\nAlthough three national laws (Environmental Conservation Act (ECA, RSA, 1989) ; Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA, RSA, 1993a) ; the National Environmental Management Act (NEMA, RSA, 1998)) similar to those in the UK exist, with the two environmental laws reflecting ''Polluter Pays'' and ''Duty of Care'' principles, they deal with broad environmental issues (Table 2a) . Unless potential polluters of HCW, such as veterinarians, are aware of their responsibilities in terms of these Acts, the Acts can easily be overlooked or ignored. While there is more relevant and specific HCW documentation in South Africa (Table 2b) (2000), if implemented, would have far-reaching consequences, as they advocate, amongst other things, minimisation and recycling, and in some cases, provide specific guidelines for all HCW.\n\nThe major difficulty in South Africa, however, is the enforcement of any legislation, unlike the situation abroad, where strict policing takes place (Anonymous, 1993; BVA, 1993a; Brody, 1993; Pratt, 1994; Nowlan, 1997; Gilles, 2001) . This lack of enforcement has been identified as an area of major concern in recent deliberations on HCW discussions in South Africa (DEAT, 2004a) . Irrespective of inadequate enforcement or policing, this should not preclude veterinarians from their social and environmental responsibilities as generators of hazardous clinical waste.\n\nThis paper reports on one aspect of Muswema's (2003) indepth documentation of veterinary waste generation and disposal in Durban, the largest and busiest port on the east coast of South Africa, in the province of KwaZulu-Natal Table 1 Categories of waste produced by veterinary practices (adapted from Nowlan, 1997) , which are similar to those described by the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA, 2002) Veterinary waste category Description Anatomical Recognisable tissue, animal carcasses, swabs and dressings (soaked with blood) Infectious\n\nAny health care waste likely to be hazardous to human health, including microbiological cultures and potentially infective waste from different activities Chemical\n\nToxic substances including pharmaceuticals, sterilising agents and used drugs (including X-ray film) Sharps\n\nHypodermic and suture needles, including broken glassware, blades and lancets Radioactive\n\nThis includes wastes that emit alpha, beta or gamma radiation Domestic\n\nOffice refuse, in particular, paper or plastic wrapping, cardboard boxes (also known as general waste) ( Fig. 1) . The Durban Metropolitan Area produces approximately 1.5 million tonnes of waste a year, three-quarters of which is collected by municipal authorities and landfilled in one of three general waste landfill sites. The municipality does not have disposal facilities for hazardous waste or health care risk waste. Two permitted privately owned landfills are low hazard co-disposal sites. As there is no high hazard waste disposal site in the region, this waste is transported by road to neighbouring provinces. The growth of the city's population (currently 3 million with a 1.8% annual growth rate) and economy has greatly increased its waste generation, while increasing costs of waste disposal and poor servicing of informal settlements have led to substantial unsafe and often illegal disposal of waste. It is estimated that 11.6% of waste generated in the city is either reused, recycled or illegally dumped (eThekweni Municipality, 2005) .\n\nTo the authors' knowledge, Muswema's (2003) study is the first to address veterinary waste in South Africa. This contribution presents a review of the current national and local legislation, regulations, guidelines, policies and deliberations that have application (direct or inferred) to veterinary waste, which has historically been neglected as a potential source of hazardous waste. The focus of this submission is on the activities of the companies contracted by veterinarians to dispose of the waste collected from their practices (Fig. 2) .\n\n2.1. Legislation, regulations, guidelines and policies relating to health care and veterinary waste A comprehensive search of the literature was undertaken to identify all documents with possible application to veterinary waste. Tables 2a (legislation) and 2b (regulations, policies and guidelines) summarise the current status of these documents. A brief description of the relevant aspects of the acts, policies and regulations is provided.\n\nIn 2002, 61 veterinary practices operated in Durban (SAVC, 2002) . Muswema (2003) surveyed 32 of these practices (52.5%) regarding their waste management practices. Selection of practices related to three criteria: type of practice (clinic or hospital); patients treated (large, small and mixed animal practice) and location of the practice (low, medium or high income area). The geographic location of each practice was entered into Microsoft Excel, and then imported into ArcView GIS and overlayed onto a thematic map using a Standardisation Index. Practices could then be randomly selected by layer. Most practices surveyed in the Durban Metropolitan Area were clinics dealing with small Table 2a South African legislation with possible application to veterinary waste management Medicines and Related Substances Act (RSA, 1965) Stipulates that no medicines may be disposed of into municipal sewerage systems.

Includes the 'Duty of Care' principle National Environment Management: Air Quality Act (RSA, 2004) Provides for national norms and standards regulating air quality monitoring, management and control by all spheres of government in order to secure ecologically sustainable development. Replaced the 1993 Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Act (RSA, 1993b) animals situated in areas designated as high and medium income. During the study period, no veterinary practices were located in low income areas. Data collected from veterinarians surveyed indicated that they utilised the services of only one or more of four waste contractors and a diagnostics laboratory. These waste contractors appeared to be the only such companies operating in the southern KwaZulu-Natal area (Durban and a neighbouring city, Pietermaritzburg). A senior manager from each of the four waste contractors and the diagnostics laboratory was approached and the questionnaire to be administered was explained. By means of this survey, a comprehensive audit of all activities relating to the collection and final disposal of veterinary waste by these waste companies was undertaken. Included in the questionnaire were issues relating to staff training and protective clothing issued. A component of the questionnaire sought to explore their awareness of the company's responsibilities in terms of legislation, policies and regulations governing waste collection, transport, storage and disposal (Tables  3a and 3b ).\n\nDespite veterinary waste generally not being classified as HCW until recently (e.g., in the DEAT (2000) and DoH (2000) draft policies, Table 2b ), several South African laws have application to veterinarians as hazardous waste gener- Table 2b South African (national and regional) policies and guidelines with application (inferred and direct) to veterinary waste Policy/regulations Green Paper -An Environmental Policy for South Africa (DEAT, 1996) Recognises that the handling of toxic and hazardous waste is in crisis, the non-disclosure of waste composition by producers, illegal dumping and lack of control over transport of waste. Includes principles of ''cradle to grave'', polluter pays and waste minimisation and recycling Minimum Requirements for the Handling and Disposal of Hazardous Waste (DWAF, 1998) Outlines minimum requirements for final disposal of health care waste (does not include veterinary waste). Recognises other forms of final disposal besides incineration. Mandates that any hazardous, toxic or infectious item in domestic waste renders it hazardous Draft Policy for the Management and Disposal of Medical Waste (DWAF, 2000) Recognises that alternatives to incineration exist and prescribes conditions for use of these technologies. Recognises importance of separation of waste White Paper on Integrated Pollution and Waste Management for South Africa (DEAT, 2000) Recognises medical and veterinary waste as possible sources of land pollution. Integrated approach includes ''polluter pays'' and the ''cradle to grave'' principles and waste avoidance through minimisation and recycling, as well as safe disposal. Recognises the need for a register of waste treatment facilities Proposed Regulations for the Control of Environmental Conditions Constituting a Danger to Health or a Nuisance (DoH, 2000) Recognises veterinary waste as source of medical waste. Also recognises that there is currently little source separation of medical waste and that domestic waste has been contaminated Veterinarians need to carry out safe waste management practices. Also includes perishable waste to be stored at 4\u00b0C, vehicles to be thermally insulated and provided with spill kits. Cytotoxic and genotoxic wastes must be labelled Recommends the implementation of SABS 0248 guidelines for storage and disposal of health care waste for doctors, dentists and medical researchers. Includes contaminated laboratory animal waste Guidelines for Veterinary Biologicals (MCCSA, 2004) No medicines may be disposed of into municipal sewerage systems. Veterinary biologicals must be incinerated ators and potential polluters (Table 2a) . These laws range from environmental (e.g., ECA, NEMA) to those governing the handling and final disposal of hazardous or infectious material (e.g., OHSA, 1993b), the Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Act (RSA, 1993b), recently replaced by the Air Quality Act (RSA, 2004) ). At the time of the study (2001) (2002) (2003) , several national and regional policies were in the process of being formulated, with direct application to veterinary waste. Recent developments since the study (e.g., Safety of Veterinary Biologicals (Medicines Control Council of South Africa (MCCSA, 2004) ; the National Waste Management Strategy Implementation Project (DEAT, 2004a,b) ; the Gauteng Province Health Care Waste Management Regulations (Gauteng Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Environment, 2004); SANS 10248:2004) now have a direct bearing (vs. previously inferred) on veterinary waste and its management from ''cradle to grave''.\n\nFrom the practices surveyed, many veterinarians were not aware of their responsibilities in terms of legislation and proposed policies. Only 9.3% of the practitioners surveyed were aware of the proposed DoH's (2000) regulations and only 31.3% claimed to know their responsibilities (e.g., ''Polluter Pays'') as generators of waste in terms of ECA and NEMA (Muswema, 2003) . While it is possible that these two general environmental laws may have been overlooked by veterinarians, the OHSA is, however, applicable to any work situation, including all aspects of waste management from generation to final disposal. Provision is made in this Act for the identification of 'standard precautions' relating to contaminated animal products as hazardous biological agents with potential risk to humans (RSA, 1989 (RSA, , 1998 .\n\nAlmost 88% of veterinary practices surveyed used the services of only five contractors to remove waste from their premises (Muswema, 2003) . Tables 3a and 3b summarise the operations and activities of these contractors. Contractors A and C collected carcasses only, whilst Contractor B, in addition to veterinary practices, also serviced other clinical waste generators. Contractor D serviced the municipal domestic waste sector. Contractor E was a diagnostics laboratory, which was included as it removed used sharps from clients' premises gratis and disposed of contaminated anatomical parts (via Contractor B). Immediately apparent from Tables 3a and 3b is that, apart from providing different services, the contractors implemented variable procedures with regard to the transport, storage and final disposal of waste collected from veterinary practices. Some of these practices appeared not to meet legislated requirements (e.g., safe transportation of waste and sufficient protective equipment for staff). In fact, two contractors claimed not to be aware of their responsibilities in terms of the current legislation (i.e., ECA and NEMA) regulating pollution and environmental degradation. Since there appeared to be little or no inspection of their records (which some indicated they did not keep), it can be assumed that any poor (and, in some instances, possibly illegal) waste management practices recorded during this study would continue until compliance is enforced. Even in terms of protecting staff, some did not provide sufficient training or protective clothing.\n\nIf the final stage of an integrated waste management plan for potentially hazardous or infectious veterinary waste involves the collection (with documentation) of appropriately labelled separated waste, safe transport to the site of final disposal, and the safe handling prior to final disposal, the 2001-2003 audit of the four waste contractors and the diagnostics laboratory identified by veterinarians in the greater Durban area suggests that all five companies do not comply with acceptable waste management practices on one or more counts. In the instance of three contractors, this was despite senior management being aware of the legal requirements of the ECA and NEMA. Several possible contraventions of OHSA were also identified, e.g., inadequate protective clothing, which should comprise at least gloves and protective eye wear (Brody, 1993) . There also appeared to be insufficient staff training, as well as poor safety and emergency procedures relating to the transport of potentially infectious material. A similar situation was evident amongst some of the veterinary practices surveyed. Staff at several Durban veterinary practices were either not trained or were poorly trained to handle potentially infectious or hazardous waste. Many were also not provided with sufficient protective clothing (Muswema, 2003) . Apart from being in contravention of OHSA, there was also non-compliance in terms of the minimum \n\nLegally, as generators of waste and as potential polluters of the environment, veterinary practitioners are ultimately responsible (''Polluter Pays'', ''Duty of Care'' and ''Cradle to Grave'' principles) for the safe handling and disposal of waste by a registered contractor once it leaves the practice. In terms of these NEMA principles, although not spelt out as explicitly as the US and UK laws and regulations (BVA, 1993b; Brody, 1993; Pratt, 1994; Hannah, 1995) , the veterinarian must ensure that the waste contractor collecting from his premises is registered and practices safe and environmentally appropriate waste transport and disposal. From Tables 3a and 3b, it is evident that waste contractors were generally in contravention of some of the legislation, and so by implication, the veterinarians could be prosecuted. Unlike in the US and the UK, where policing ensures compliance in this regard, there is little or no enforcement in South Africa. Two reasons can immediately be offered. In the first instance, during transformation which began in \u00b11994, more pressing social, political and economic issues generally take priority over environmental issues. In the second instance, at the time of the study, some of the enforceable legislation may have been interpreted as not sufficiently specific to include veterinary waste (e.g., NEMA) and was therefore possibly ignored, while more definitive regulations and guidelines for safe HCW disposal (which, until 2000, did not include veterinary waste) were in draft form and therefore not enforceable. Even if, at the time of this study (2001) (2002) (2003) , it was assumed that HCW included veterinary waste, South African legislation pertaining to such waste was vague and was usually applicable only at the local authority level. Even if by-laws existed, considering that state or provincial medical facilities do not fall within the jurisdiction of the local authority, it is probable that contaminated clinical waste enters the municipal waste stream from these sources (Anonymous, 1993) . In view of this, the poor waste management practices described for veterinarians and waste removal contractors for the period of the study should therefore not be surprising. The considerable momentum over the past year or two in terms of developing policies and regulations governing HCW (which now includes veterinary waste), in which issues relating to enforcement are highlighted, should now pave the way for stricter control over all aspects of HCW management. Current revisions to the SAVC guidelines will undoubtedly take cognisance of these latest developments, as well of more recent documents relating specifically to the profession (e.g., Safety of Veterinary Biologicals, MCCSA, 2004).\n\nFrom data gathered from waste contractors, it would appear that collection of specific waste categories (e.g., hazardous, domestic, etc.) from veterinary practices requires appropriately labelled separation within the clinic or hospital at source (Tables 3a and 3b) , as is now advocated in the 2004 SANS 10248 document. Thus, veterinarians, as producers of hazardous waste requiring incineration prior to landfilling, should have an appropriate separation and storage system on the premises of their practices. Most practitioners, however, had no waste management plans and were generally not aware of their legal responsibilities in this regard. Furthermore, at least 12% of potentially hazardous or infectious veterinary waste was disposed of with domestic waste, thereby potentially compromising the health of municipal workers removing the waste and members of the community allowed to 'pick' on some landfill sites (Muswema, 2003) . Such inappropriate hazardous waste disposal is, however, not unique to South Africa. An Australian waste contractor has appealed in The Aus-tralian Veterinary Journal to veterinarians to dispose of their hazardous waste appropriately as some of his staff had sustained needle stick injuries following the incorrect disposal of syringes (Anonymous, 2000) .\n\nThe ''Polluter Pays'' principle, as it relates to the veterinarian as a potential generator of hazardous waste, has further application in the present study. Three of the five contractors operated incinerators and for only one could appropriate registration be confirmed. In South Africa, like in the UK and USA, incineration is currently legislated for clinical waste disposal, particularly anatomical waste, despite more environmentally friendly technologies (e.g., microwaving, autoclaving and steam sterilisation) (Poggiolini, 2000) . South Africa's policy on Handling and Disposal of Hazardous Waste (DWAF, 1998 (DWAF, , 2000 does, however, take cognisance of these alternative methods, and so future legislation might then enforce some of these cleaner technologies. Globally, incineration is a fiercely debated issue, largely because of its negative impact on the environment, with incineration of medical waste being identified specifically as contributing to atmospheric pollution. When comparing medical and domestic waste incineration, the former accounted for 30% of dioxins and furans generated while the latter was responsible for 1% only (Tickel and Watson, 1992) . In the US, medical waste incinerators ranked amongst the top four sources of dioxins and anthropogenic mercury emissions. Switching to autoclaving for some hospitals resulted in an 80% reduction in operational costs, and also improved relationships with the community (Kaiser et al., 2001) , presumably through reduced emissions and less air pollution. Although minimum requirements regarding incineration in South Africa were governed by the Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Act (RSA, 1993b, but replaced in 2004 by the Air Quality Act), it has been estimated that only half of the bio-hazardous waste generated daily was incinerated without polluting the atmosphere (Anonymous, 1993) . It is interesting to note that many unregistered incinerators are associated with provincial (under local government jurisdiction) hospitals (Rigby, 2002) . In the context of the present study, with apparently inappropriate final handling and disposal of some of their waste by contractors, the veterinarians, as the generators would be liable, should enforcement be instituted.\n\nPerhaps the most neglected aspect relating to veterinary waste disposal emerging from Muswema's (2003) study was the poor or absent documentation regarding to the types and volumes of waste generated by practitioners. In the event of an accident, e.g., during transportation or final disposal, or inappropriate disposal (e.g., sharps in domestic waste) by a contractor, the absence of a documented waste audit system would make it difficult to identify the waste generator to apply the ''Polluter Pays'' principle. Since only 87.5% of veterinarians surveyed made use of waste contractors, this begs the question: What is the fate of the waste (some of which is potentially hazardous) generated by the remaining 12.5% of practices? In addition, \u00b112% of hazardous veterinary waste generated by the practices was reported to be disposed of via the domestic waste stream (Muswema, 2003) . In terms of the 2002 HPCSA Guidelines, this contamination renders municipal waste 'infectious', requiring incineration. Since none of the waste contractors handled chemicals or pharmaceuticals, a query regarding the fate of potentially hazardous substances from these practices must also be raised. One must assume that some of these chemicals were disposed of via the domestic waste stream or the sewage system, despite the Veterinary and Para-veterinary Professions Act (RSA, 2002) subscribing to the Medicines and Related Substances Act (RSA, 1965) . Muswema's (2003) comprehensive study on several aspects of veterinary waste generation and disposal (which includes the aspect currently presented) in a major South African city, apart from being the first such study in South Africa, has highlighted the historic neglected status of veterinary waste and has identified areas of veterinary waste management that require attention. His study indicated that not only are many veterinarians unaware of their legal responsibilities in this regard, but some of the waste contractors are equally ignorant. Poor waste management in the veterinary practices, followed by incorrect transport and disposal measures, as well as failure to inform and equip staff sufficiently, are just some aspects of non-compliance by both veterinarians and waste contractors. At the time of the study, veterinary waste was just emerging from its ''neglected'' status, with little or no legislation and guidelines specifically governing its handling and disposal. More recently, however, with veterinary practices, clinics and hospitals now included as health care facilities (e.g., SANS 10248:2004) with minimum requirements and with hazardous veterinary waste assigned the same status as human HCW in South Africa, there can be no excuse for non-compliance. Following the example of the enforceable Gauteng Province HCW Management Regulations (2004), which now include veterinary waste in the definition, in which provision is made for the ''Polluter Pays'' principle, waste tracking and auditing and most importantly, reinforcement and penalties for non-compliance, national regulations are also currently being developed in conjunction with individual provincial needs. Considerable success in terms of HCW was thus achieved in 2004. The onus now rests with the SAVC as the professional governing body to ensure continuing education of veterinarians about their social and environmental responsibilities, much like that undertaken by the BVA (1993b) and the American Veteri-nary Medical Association (Brody, 1993) . It is encouraging that the SAVC is currently revising its guidelines for veterinary practices, which will presumably take cognisance of recent developments in holistic HCW management. The Medicines Control Council of South Africa document (MCCSA, 2004) regarding the safety of veterinary biologicals will also contribute to the safer disposal of potentially harmful HCW generated by veterinary practices (MCCSA, 2004) . The shortcomings and concerns regarding veterinary waste identified in Muswema's (2003) study, some of which have been discussed in this submission (e.g., safe transportation, storage, handling and final disposal), are therefore likely to be addressed (locally, nationally and professionally) in the not too distant future. It remains to be seen, however, whether reinforcement of this legislation will become a national priority."}
