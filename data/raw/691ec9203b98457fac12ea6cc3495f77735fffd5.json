EAV is the best-characterized arterivirus, although recent studies have increasingly been focused on PRRSV due to its economic importance. Arteriviruses are enveloped viruses with a polycistronic plus-strand RNA genome (12\u00c015 kb; [2\u00c06]). Their replicase proteins are expressed from open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b that encode two large polyproteins: pp1a (187\u00c0260 kDa) and pp1ab (345\u00c0422 kDa), the latter resulting from a C-terminal extension of pp1a via ribosomal frameshifting. Both polyproteins are processed extensively by three or four ORF1a-encoded endopeptidases to generate nonstructural proteins (nsps) [7\u00c015]. The arterivirus proteases and proteolytic pathways should be compared with those of the distantly related coronaviruses (see Chapters 494 and 546) and roniviruses, all of which are united in the order Nidovirales [16, 17] .\n\nThe arterivirus serine proteinase (SP) domain is located in non-structural protein 4 (nsp4), a 21 kDa cleavage product from the central region of the ORF1aencoded polypeptide. The SP was first identified and linked structurally to cellular chymotrypsin-family proteinases by comparative sequence analysis of the ORF1a protein of the arterivirus prototype, equine arteritis virus EAV [2] , a prediction that was experimentally verified in subsequent expression experiments in cultured cells [10] . Due to a number of striking similarities with picornavirus cysteine 3C proteinases, arterivirus nsp4 is also called a 3C-like proteinase (see below).\n\nThe activity of the EAV SP domain has been detected in vivo, both in infected cells and in transient expression systems upon expression of appropriate parts of the ORF1a polyprotein [8, 10] . Moreover, in vitro activity assays were developed for both EAV and PRRSV using recombinant nsp4 purified from E. coli and synthetic peptides or recombinant proteins as substrates [18\u00c020]. In EAV-infected cells, in addition to the mature nsp4, an nsp3-4 processing intermediate with a long half-life is synthesized. Nsp4 itself and all other proteins located downstream in the replicative polyproteins are derived through nsp4-mediated cleavages. The EAV SP is now known to mediate (at least) six cleavages at GlukSer/ Gly/Ala sites in the C-terminal half of the ORF1a protein [10, 21] and three additional sites in the ORF1bencoded polyprotein [12, 13] . These nine sites are conserved in arteriviruses and can be described by the formula (Glu/Gln)k(Gly/Ser/Ala/Asn/Lys). A similar substrate specificity was originally described for picornavirus cysteine 3C proteinases (picornains; see Chapter 537). The EAV nsp4 SP domain has been shown to be able to cleave a separately expressed ORF1b polyprotein in trans [13] .\n\nThe arterivirus nsp4 SP is a (predicted) 196\u00c0204 residue proteolytic enzyme whose conserved sequence elements in the N-terminal B160 residue domain (Figure 691 .1) match functionally important residues of clan PA enzymes belonging to two different groups. The SP utilizes the canonical His-Asp-Ser catalytic triad found in classical chymotrypsin-family proteinases. On the other hand, its putative substrate-binding region contains Thr/ Ser and His residues which are conserved in the so-called viral 3C(-like) cysteine peptidases (Chapter 537) [10] and which determine their specificity for Gln (sometimes Glu) as the P1 residue of their cleavage sites and mainly Gly, Ala or Ser at the P1 0 position.\n\nThe replacement of the members of the predicted catalytic triad of EAV nsp4 (His1103, Asp1129 and Ser1184; here and hereafter polyprotein numbering is used) confirmed their essential nature [10] . The Ser1184 to Cys mutant did not show any proteolytic activity. However, the replacement of Asp1129 by Glu, a substitution which can also be found in certain 3C-like cysteine peptidases, was partially tolerated. The substrate specificity of nsp4 and the putative role of Thr1179 and His1199 in substrate recognition were supported by the results of characterization of the predicted cleavage sites and substrate pocket mutants [10] .\n\nNsp4 structures have now been obtained by X-ray crystallography for both EAV and PRRS-II [19, 22] (Figure 691.2) . The protein consists of three domains, with domains I and II forming the typical chymotrypsinlike two-\u03b2-barrel fold of the SP. In addition, arterivirus nsp4 SP also contains a C-terminal domain III of B40 residues with an uncharacterized function [19, 22] . This domain III is connected to domain II through a flexible hinge region, and in EAV it was shown to be dispensable for proteolytic activity [23] .\n\nTo allow the biochemical and structural characterization of EAV and PRRSV nsp4 protocols for the large-scale production of recombinant nsp4 in E. coli were developed [19, 20, 22, 23] . These protocols involve expression of nsp4 either carrying an N-or C-terminal hexahistidine tag, or fused to maltose binding protein or glutathione S-transferase, which was subsequently cleaved off. These recombinant proteinases were shown to be proteolytically active in different trans-cleavage assays. [24] and Clustal [25] using the Viralis platform [26] and was prepared for publication with ESPript 2.2 [27] . The positions of the catalytic Ser, His and Asp residues, and substrate-binding Thr/Ser and His residues of the protease domain are marked with * and #, respectively. Conserved and identical residues in all viruses are colored. Secondary structure elements for PRRSV-II nsp4 [19] are schematically shown on top of the alignment. GenBank and/or RefSeq accession numbers of respective virus genome sequences as well as the PDB accession number for PRRSV-II nsp4 are presented next to the virus acronyms.\n\nThe extensive proteolytic processing of the replicase polyproteins is a major mechanism of regulation of genome expression of arteriviruses. The nsp4 SP is the main proteinase responsible for the production of the majority of nsps from the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins (reviewed in [15\u00c017]. Among the proteins produced are key viral enzymes like the nsp9 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the nsp10 RNA-helicase. The suppression of the production of the latter proteins, or the downstream-located nsp11 and nsp12, by mutagenesis of the respective nsp4-cleavage sites blocked EAV replication [13] . Likewise, mutagenesis of the SP cleavage sites in the C-terminal half of the ORF1a-encoded polyprotein invariably blocked or severely inhibited EAV RNA synthesis [21] . In EAV, the poorly understood fine-tuning of replicase polyprotein proteolysis by nsp4 may involve its domain III [23] . The proteolytic activity of nsp4 is strongly influenced by other processing steps mediated by two or three cysteine protease activities residing in the nsp1-2 region of the replicase polyproteins (see Chapters 495\u00c0497). In particular, cleaved nsp2 was reported to act as a co-factor in the cleavage by SP of the nsp4#5 site at the C-terminus of the SP domain [14] . The presence of nsp2 probably promotes the correct spatial organization that is required for cleavage of this site in the polyprotein. In the absence of nsp2, the nsp5#6 and nsp6#7 sites rather than the nsp4#5 site are cleaved by the SP [14] . As yet, the functional significance of the use of alternative processing pathways by the SP to process the C-terminal part of the ORF1a-encoded polyprotein remains unclear although it may limit the variety of proteins that could otherwise be derived from the polyprotein [16] .\n\nThe SP combines properties of two different groups of chymotrypsin-like enzymes: it utilizes the His-Asp-Ser catalytic triad found in classical chymotrypsin-like proteinases (clan PA, subclan S), and its putative substratebinding region contains Thr/Ser and His residues which are typical of peptidases of clan PA subclan C, including diverse picornains (also known as cysteine 3C and 2A proteases of picornaviruses and 3C-like proteases of positive-stranded RNA viruses distantly related to picornaviruses) (Chapters 537\u00c0546). As such, it can be considered as the prototype of a novel subgroup, the 3Clike serine proteinases [10] . Similar proteinases were predicted and partially characterized in plant sobemoviruses (Chapter 692), luteoviruses and pea enation mottle virus, and animal astroviruses and toroviruses, a subfamily of the Coronaviridae.\n\nPolyclonal peptide antisera against EAV nsp4 have been raised in rabbits and are available from the authors for research purposes on request [8] .\n\nFor further information, the following papers are recommended: Snijder et al.
