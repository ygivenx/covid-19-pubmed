{"title": "A SENSITIVE RADIOIMMUNOASSAY FOR THE DETERMINATION OF ANTIBODIES TO MOUSE HEPATITIS VIRUS", "body": "Coronaviruses are a group of enveloped RNA viruses that cause a broad spectrum of diseases in their natural hosts (Tyrell, 1978; . These diseases include encephalitis, hepatitis, interstitial pneumonitis, nephritis and enteritis (Piazza, 1969) . The spectrum and severity of disease produced by coronaviruses vary with age and genetic background of the host, route of infection and size of the virus inoculum. Resistance to severe acute infection appears to depend, at least in part, on the potential for replication of mouse hepatic virus (MHV) in cells of the reticuloendothelial system, a genetically restricted event (Virelizier and Allison, 1976; Weiser and Bang, 1976) . Recently, interest in MHV as a model for human hepatitis has been revived as the result of observations implicating variables at the level of the host as important in the pathogenesis of the disease (Krzystyniak and Dupuy, 1981; Levy et al., 1982) .\n\nA major problem in MHV research has been the difficulty in obtaining experimental animals which have not been previously exposed to the virus as indicated by the presence of antibodies. Previously, three methods utilized for determining antibody to MHV have been a plaque neutralization assay, immunofluorescence and complement fixation . Neutralization and immunofluorescence, although highly sensitive, are time consuming and complement fixation is too insensitive to be useful. Recently an enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA; Kraaijeveld et al., 1980) has been described and has become commercially available, but is too expensive for screening large numbers of mice to be used in a research laboratory working on MHV. We have therefore developed a highly sensitive and reproducible radioimmunoassay which can be used for both screening large numbers of mice and studying the molecular biology and immunopathology of MHV.\n\nThe origin and growth of the murine cell lines 17 CLl, DBT and L2 cells have been described previously (Levy et al., 1981a) . The cells were routinely propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Flow Laboratories Inc., Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum (Biocell Laboratories, Carson City, CA) and 25 ug/ml chlortetracycline hydrochloride grade II (Sigma Chemical Co., St.\n\nLouis, MO) and buffered with N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 3-(N-morpholine-3-propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), N-Tris (hydroxymethyl) -3-methyl-2-aminoethane sulfonic acid (TES) and 4 mM glutamine (Sigma Chemical Co.).\n\nThe origin and growth of the A59 and JHM strains of MHV have previously been described . MHV-1, MHV-S and MHV-3 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD. Viruses were plaque purified twice on monolayers of DBT cells and seed stocks prepared.\n\nWorking stocks were grown in 17 CL1 cells infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10m4 plaque forming units (PFU)/cell. Viruses were assayed on monolayers of L2 cells in a standard plaque assay as described previously (Levy et al., 1981a) .\n\nA59, MHV-1, MHV-3 and MHV-S were grown to high titer on monolayers of 17 CL1 cells. Viruses were harvested by 1 cycle of freeze thawing and clarified by centrifugation at 4500 X g for 1 at 4\u00b0C. For some preparations an aliquot of\n\n[32P]orthophosphate labelled virus was added to follow the virus through the purification. The supernatant was recovered and the virus was precipitated by adding to each 10 ml, 1.1 ml 5M NaCl and 5.55 ml 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 in MOPS-saline disodium ethylene diamine tetracetate (EDTA), pH 6.8 (10 mM MOPS, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, Baker Scientific Co., Philipsburg, NJ; Wege et al., 1978) . The solution was stirred on ice for 30 min and the virus pelleted by centrifugation at 9250 X g at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in a small volume of MOPS-saline-EDTA and overlayed onto 11 ml of a 5-25% (w/w) K-tartrate gradients and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm in an SW 41 rotor for 45 min at 4\u00b0C. The gradient was fractionated and aliquots counted in a liquid scintillation counter. The fractions containing virus were pooled, diluted to a volume of 4 ml with MOPS-saline-EDTA, overlayed onto 8 ml of a lo-40% (w/w) K-tartrate gradient and centrifuged for 4 h at 4\u00b0C at 35,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor. The gradient was fractionated and the virus peak located as before. The pooled virus was diluted to 5 ml with MOPS-saline-EDTA and pelleted at 45,000 rpm for 30 min at 4\u00b0C in an SW50.1 rotor. The viral pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml carbonate buffer by 3 bursts of sonication at 4\u00b0C. Viral protein concentration was determined in a modified Lowry assay as described previously (Levy et al., 1981b) .\n\nVirus was assayed on monolayers of L2 cells in a standard plaque assay as described previously (Levy et al., 1981a) . For neutralization, sera which was heat inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min was incubated with 100 PFU of MHV for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. Two-hundred ul of the mixture were then layered onto confluent monolayers of L2 cells in 6-well plastic cluster dishes (Linbro Plastics, McLean, VA) for 30 min at 22\u00b0C and then overlayed with 1% agarose in DMEM supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum (FCS). The plates were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator and then stained with 0.1 gm% crystal violet in 20% ethanol for enumeration of plaques.\n\nFlexible 96-well microtiter plates (Dynatech Laboratories Inc., Alexandria, VA) were coated with either MHV strain A59 or a mixture of MHV-A59, MHV-1 and MHV-S virus which had been purified by gradient centrifugation.\n\nIndividual wells were coated with antigen diluted in 100 ul of carbonate buffer pH 9.6 and were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in a humid chamber. The antigen was cross-linked using 10 ul of a 10 mg/ml solution of I-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide HCl (Calbiochem-Behring Corp., La Jolla, CA). The following morning, the plates were washed repeatedly with 200 ul aliquots of 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.02% sodium azide in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) (SPRIA buffer) and the carbodiimide was inactivated with 0.1 M NH4Cl for 1 h and the plate was repeatedly washed with SPRIA buffer. 1Z51-labelled affinity purified goat antimouse immunoglobulin (GAMG) (specific activity 3.2 X 10\" cpm/mg) was then added and the plates incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The plates were then washed and counted in a gamma counter. Appropriate positive and negative sera were included in all assays as controls and all samples were assayed in triplicate.\n\nViruses were grown on 17 CL1 cells as described. MHV-A59 grew to a tenfold higher titer than MHV-JHM, MHV-1, MHV-S and MHV3. The virus was followed through purification by the presence of small amounts of 32P-labelled virus. However at each step a distinct opalescent band could be seen which corresponded to the 32P-labelled virus. The combination of velocity and isopycnic sedimentation K-tartrate density gradients purified virus to apparent homogeneity (Fig. 1) uCi/ml in methionine-free medium. Virus was then purified from the culture fluids as described in the Materials and methods. The purified virus (reduced) was electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and Buorographs prepared as described previously (Maizel, 1971) . In reduced form, E2 glycoprotein (180,000\n\nand 90,000 daltons), nucleocapsid protein (N) (60,000 daltons) and El glycoprotein (20,000 to 24,000 daltons) are easily seen. (Fig. 2) . To further rule out contamination in the preparation, [35S]methionine labelled virus was electrophoresed through a 10% polyacrylamide gel and analysed by autoradiography.\n\nAll three of the structural viral proteins were visualized and no contamination was noted (Fig. 2) . We were able to recover lo-15% of the infectious virus but this probably represents a minimum estimate of the total recovery of viral antigen as it is based on biologic activity, and certainly much of this could be lost by chemical and physical treatment during purification.\n\nBy the modified Lowry technique, 4 X lo9 PFU was found to correspond to 220 f 30 ug of protein.\n\nTo determine the specificity of the i251-labelled GAMG probe, microtiter plates were coated with 0.732 ng of mouse IgG, 1 ng of IgM lambda myeloma 104-E, 1 ng of IgM kappa myeloma HP-76 and 1.5 ng of IgA myeloma MOP-C 315 kindly provided by Dr. Brian Underdown (Table 1) . Two-hundred thousand cpm of t251-labelled GAMG was added and the wells counted. The antibody was capable of detecting IgG most effectively and also detected IgM as determined against 2 monoclonal IgM molecules. The detection of kappa was greater than lambda and this could. be consistent with the antibody having greater anti-kappa characteristics or by the fact that kappa myeloma protein binds better to the plates than lambda myeloma protein.\n\nThe probe also detected IgA antibody, although at a lower efficiency than other immunoglobulin classes. The GAMG probe was shown not to react directly with the viral protein coated plates as demonstrated by low background counts which were of the same magnitude as those when antigen was omitted from the plate.\n\nThe microtiter plates were coated with varying amounts (l-50 ng) of purified MHV-A59 and tested with a positive antibody against MHV-A59 to determine the optimal antigen concentration. Antibody could be detected with as little as 1 ng of antigen (data not shown) and could be easily detected with 10 ng (Fig. 3) but optimal sensitivity was observed at 25 ng antigen (Fig. 3) with no significant increase noted at 50 ng of antigen per well (Fig. 3) . Therefore, in all subsequent determinations an antigen concentration of 25 ng/lOO pl per well was used. Known positive and negative sera to MHV-A59 were titered against antigen-coated plates. The assay was optimal at a serum dilution of l/200 to l/400 and a dilution of l/250 was chosen to screen all sera. A positive sera was defined as greater than 2 SD above the mean of 5 negative control sera.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 4 , under standard conditions of our assay, a known positive sera could be detected at a dilution of l/51,200. When the RIA was compared to a plaque reduction assay and the commercially available ELISA (Microbiological Associate, Walkersville, MD), it proved significantly more sensitive to either of these assays (Table 2) being 150-fold more sensitive than the plaque reduction assay, and greater than 50-fold more sensitive than the commercially available ELISA. Furthermore, in following seroconversion of MHV-3 infected A/J mice, we were able to detect antibody by the RIA at 3 days when both the plaque neutralization assay and ELISA were negative. At 7 days following infection the RIA was 120 times more sensitive than the ELISA and 400 times more sensitive than the plaque neutralization assay. In addition, using this assay, we were able to detect antibody to a variety of MHV serotypes. Antibody to MHV-3 could be detected with equal efficiency against MHV-3 or MHV-A59 as the target antigen. MHV-A59 was also an adequate target for anti-JHM sera. However, with sera having low levels of antibody to MHV-S (neutralization titers < l/IO) the results of the RIA were erratic using either MHV-A59 or MHV-3 as the target. Using a pool of purified antigens including MHV-A59, MHV-S and MHV-1 we were able to detect sera with neutralization titers as low as l/5 with ease. Hierholzer et al. (1979) demonstrated previously, by a complement-fixation assay, that A59 antigen reacted with antisera directed against a wide variety of strains of MHV. However, there were relative differences in sensitivity to antisera to MHV with antisera to MHV-1 and MHV-S being the least reactive of those examined. The RIA, however, appears to be significantly sensitive so that this is not a problem in most cases. Sera with very low titers (< l/10) by a sensitive homologous plaque reduction assay to MHV-S (kindly provided by Dr. Abigail\n\nSmith, Yale University) were occassionally negative by RIA when using only A59 as the target antigen. However, we were able to detect antibody to MHV in the majority of cases. By using a pool of antigens including MHV-S in addition to A59, we are able to improve the sensitivity of the assay for this strain.\n\nThe RIA which we describe in this paper, has proven to be a fast, highly sensitive, economical and a reproducible assay. It is suitable for screening large numbers of samples and therefore is useful in screening for hybridomas.\n\nWe have used it in screening hybridomas against specific viral proteins. In addition, we have also employed this assay for the detection of outbreaks of MHV in breeding colonies and have found it to be most satisfactory.\n\nIn one case, the assay was positive for MHV which was later confirmed by the commercially available ELISA, although the plaque reduction assay was negative. In a second outbreak, the ELISA was negative while the plaque reduction assay and the RIA were both positive.\n\nIn two other cases, the assay was negative for MHV and in fact, further investigations revealed that the outbreaks were the result of ectromelia and Sendai viruses. We chose A59 to be the target antigen because of its growth to high titer in tissue cultures and its adequate antigenic spectrum cross reacting with most MHV serotypes. However, we recommend using a pool of purified antigens (A59, MHV-S and MHV-1) in order to maximize the sensitivity of the assay to other strains of MHV because we were unable to detect low titers of antibody to MHV-S using only MHV-A59 as the target antigen.\n\nAs well as being useful in screening for antibody to MHV, the assay can be used to quantitate this antibody. The method chosen to determine the antibody titer is analogous to other standard serologic end-point dilution assays such as complement fixation, hemagglutination inhibition and plaque neutralization. Because of the shape of the curve (Fig. 3) , it is necessary to do an end-point dilution assay, since the linear portion of the curve is only between l/5 and l/400. The increased sensitivity of the RIA compared to the ELISA is probably due to the use of purified viral antigens and an affinity-purified goat antimouse probe with high specific activity. This probe could detect IgG with high sensitivity as can be seen in Table 1 . In addition, anti-p activity was detected as seen by reactivity to two monoclonal IgM molecules. It appears that the antibody has higher anti-kappa than anti-lambda activity, but it is possible to explain this result on increased binding of kappa myeloma to the plate. IgA was also detected but less efficiently than IgG or IgM. The fact that this probe has all specificities might explain the ability to detect early seroconversion.\n\nMHV contains three structural proteins, nucleocapsid protein, peplomer glycoprotein (E2) and a glycoprotein analogous to matrix protein of negative stranded viruses (El) (Sturman, 1977; Sturman and Holmes, 1977; Hierholzer et al., 1979; Sturman, 198 1) . NP-40 treated virion was no more effective than non-detergent treated virus as a target antigen (data not shown). This suggests that the Tween 20 in the buffers is making the viral envelope more permeable, thus allowing internal antigens to be accesssible to antibody. Although the major component of MHV is the nucleocapsid protein ( Fig. 2) at the dilution chosen for screening (l/250), the system is unsaturated and therefore probably detects antibodies to all three proteins in the proportions in which they are present. Further investigations are now under way to rigorously establish whether this is in fact true."}
