{"title": "Antibody against adult diarrhoea rotavirus among healthy adult population in China", "body": "The method of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of rotavirus antigen has been widely applied (Yolken and Leister, 1981; Rodak et al., 1982; Wall et al., 1982; Inouye et al., 1984) . However, a method of using unknown serum to coat the wells of the microtiter plate directly in using the sandwich ELISA method with double antibodies for the assay of the antibody against rotavirus in unknown serum has not been published. Our recent use of this method was successful in the assay of antibody against adult diarrhoea rotavirus in a total of 1,380 sera of healthy adults obtained from some provinces and cities of China. The method and our results are reported as follows. \n\nFecal fluid was taken from a case of epidemic adult diarrhoea containing a large quantity of rotavirus particles, as shown by electron microscopy. A 50% suspension was made with 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, and centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 10 min. The supematant fluid was mixed with an equal volume of chloroform and centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant fluid was aspirated out and centrifuged at a superspeed of 51,000 rpm for 2 h. A small amount of PBS was used to resuspend the precipitate. Density gradient centrifugation was carried out by layering the suspension on 45% sucrose, 60% sucrose and 40% cesium chloride and centrifuging at a superspeed of 40,000 rpm for 2 h. The cesium chloride portion in the lower layer was collected and taken as the purified adult rotavirus antigen after dialysis against PBS. Electron microscopic observation showed complete rotavirus particles with typical structure together with a large number of degraded particles. Its content of virus particles was 106~5-10s/ml. RNA genome electrophoresis revealed the characteristic pattern of 11 segments of adult diarrhoea rotavirus RNA genome (Qiu et al., 1985) .\n\n(1) Rabbit anti-adult diarrhoea rotavirus immune serum. The above purified rotavirus antigen was injected subcutaneously and intramuscularly into rabbits of 2,000 g body wt three times at 2-3 week intervals. An equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant mixed with the virus antigen was used in the first injection, an equal volume of Freund's incomplete adjuvant in the second injection and pure virus antigen for the third injection. A total of 4.5 ml of virus antigen was used for immunizing each rabbit. The rabbits were bled two weeks after the last injection. The titer of antibody determined by immunodiffusion test was 1:16 and the content of IgG was 17.5 mg/ml.\n\n(2) Guinea-pig anti-adult diarrhoea rotavirus immune serum. The same method of immunization was carried out in guinea-pigs of 300 g body wt. A total of 1.5 ml of virus antigen was used for immunizing each guinea-pig. The guinea-pigs were bled two weeks after the last injection. The immunodiffusion titer was 1:8 and the content of IgG was 18.7 mg/ml.\n\n(3) Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labelled goat anti-guinea-pig serum. The procedures of preparation were as follows: (a) Normal guinea-pig serum was precipitated with saturated ammonium sulfate three times and filtered through DEAEcellulose column chromatography. The IgG obtained was confirmed to be pure by polyacrylamide electrophoresis with a content of 15 mg/ml. (b) Normal guinea-pig IgG was injected three times subcutaneously and intramuscularly into a healthy goat of 20 kg body wt. The method used was the same as above. The goat was bled 10 days after the last injection. The immunodiffusion titer was >1:64. Goat serum was precipitated with saturated ammonium sulfate twice and filtered through DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. Its IgG content was 12.6 mg/ml. (c) 10 mg of the goat anti-guinea-pig IgG was conjugated with HRP (Sigma, VI type, RZ 30) by the modified sodium periodide method. The final molar ratio of HRP-IgG conjugate was 1.29.\n\n(4) Normal rabbit serum served as the negative control serum in the experiment.\n\n(5) Sera of healthy adults. Sera were obtained from a total of 1,380 healthy adults with an age range of 20-40 years, of whom 362 were from Beijing and Hebei Province, 105 from Yinchuan of Ningxia Autonomous Region, 62 from Xuchang and Xinye of Henan Province, 324 from Hulunbeir Meng and Yakeshi of Nei Mongol Autonomous Region, 337 from Dexing and Gaoan of Jiangxi Province, 50 from Xizang Autonomous Region, 50 from Yanbian Autonomous Prefecture, 50 from Hainan Island and 40 from Chinghai Province (Fig. 1) .\n\nThe procedures were as follows: (a) Coating of wells of the microtiter plate with the first antibody. 0.05 M carbonate buffer solution, pH 9.6, was used to dilute rabbit anti-adult diarrhoea rotavirus immune serum to 1:15, normal rabbit serum to 1:lO and 1,380 sera of healthy adults to 1:2 which were then used to coat wells of microtiter plates separately with 100 pi/well and placed at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. To the naked eye, the blank control appeared colorless, the negative result appeared light yellow and the positive result appeared from deep yellow to brown. A spectrophotometer for ELISA (MB-1 type, Beijing), with a wave-length of 492 nm, was used to determine the P/N ratio (positive value/negative value). The substrate control was adjusted to 0. The negative serum control (normal rabbit serum) was 0.05. The positive serum control (rabbit anti-adult diarrhoea rotavirus immune serum) was 0.12. Those tested sera showing deep yellow to brown color and higher P/N ratios were considered \n\nA total of 1,380 sera of healty adults obtained from some provinces and cities of China were assayed for the antibody against adult diarrhoea rotavirus, of which 141 were positive, giving a total positive rate of 10.2%. The results are shown in Table 1 .\n\nIn order to confirm the accuracy of the results, a blocking test was carried out on 25 positive serum specimens as well as on rabbit anti-adult diarrhoea rotavirus immune serum. Its results revealed that the P/N ratios after blocking were all lower than those before blocking. The P/N ratio of normal rabbit serum serving as the negative control showed no change after blocking.\n\nA method of using unknown serum as the first antibody to coat wells of microtiter plates directly in ELISA has not been described. A blocking test was carried out on 25 serum specimens positive for the antibody against adult diarrhoea rotavirus as well as on rabbit rotavirus immune serum. The results revealed that P/N ratios all declined after blocking, showing that this modified method is reliable for the assay of antibody.\n\nOf I380 sera of healthy adults examined, 141 were positive for the antibody against adult diarrhoea rotavirus, showing a positive rate of 10.2%. The 25 positive specimens from Beijing and Hebei Province were traced for their sources and it was found that 17 of these were obtained from rural areas of Qian'an County, Hebei Province. According to preliminary information, epidemic adult diarrhoea had occurred in that district two years previously. Therefore, further retrospective investigations might be required.\n\nAntibody against adult diarrhoea rotavirus tias not detected in 50 sera of healthy adults from Xizang Autonomous Region. Only 1 out of 50 sera of healthy adults from Hainan Island was positive for this antibody. It is probably because their communications with the outside are not convenient, thus epidemic adult diarrhoea occurring in other provinces obviously has not spread to Xizang and Hainan Island."}
