{"title": "", "body": "In late July 1976, there was an outbreak of severe pneumonia among individuals attending an American Legion convention at the Bellevue Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia, PA. Two hundred twenty-one individuals, predominantly men, were stricken, and 34 died. The investigation that followed identified a new bacterium, which was subsequently named Legionella pneumophila (1, 2) . Almost 50 years later, Legionnaires' disease is a nationally notifiable disease in the United States (3) . The CDC estimates that between 8,000 and 18,000 cases of Legionnaires' disease occur in the United States annually (4) . In addition, between 1995 and 2005, over 32,000 cases were reported to the European Working Group for Legionella Infections (5) . It has subsequently been learned that an unidentified gram-negative rod that was frozen in 1947 was later identified as Legionella sp., so the American Legion convention was not the first time Legionella was isolated from humans (6) .\n\nHospital-acquired Legionella pneumonia has a fatality rate of 12% (7), with L. pneumophila causing 80% of human infections. The organism causes two different illnesses, the typical Legionnaires' disease, which is a severe form of pneumonia, and Pontiac fever, a flu-like illness with a much milder course and, usually, no fatalities. Legionella spp. are not transmitted person to person but through the air and in water. Symptoms of Legionnaires' disease include fever, a nonproductive cough, headache, myalgias, rigors, dyspnea, diarrhea, and delirium. Erythromycin and, later, ciprofloxacin were designated the initial drugs of choice for the treatment of legionellosis; however, newer macrolides, such as azithromycin or clarithromycin, and newer quinolones, such as levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and gemifloxacin, have also been found to be effective (8) .\n\nThe traditional gold standard for the diagnosis of Legionella infections is culture. However, legionellae will not grow on routine laboratory media, such as blood and chocolate agars; therefore, it is important for the clinician to notify the laboratory that Legionella is suspected so that the appro-Vol. 37, No. 15 August 1, 2015 www.cmnewsletter.com priate media are set up. The organism grows best on buffered charcoal yeast extract (BCYE) agar; this medium contains cysteine and iron, which are required by this environmental organism.\n\nClinical microbiology laboratories that perform cultures for Legionella usually use BCYE, a non-selective medium, and BCYE with polymyxin B, anisomycin, and cefamandole, a selective medium designed to inhibit the growth of normal respiratory organisms, which may be present in higher density and compete with the Legionella spp. in sputum or other specimens, such as bronchial alveolar lavage fluids.\n\nAfter 72 to 96 hours of incubation, colonies of Legionella are round and convex with entire edges (Fig. 1) ; the colony itself is described as having a ground-glass (or iridescent) appearance under the stereoscope. Most Legionella strains are oxidase variable and negative (inert, or non-reactive) for most standard biochemicals, such as nitrate reduction, urease, and carbohydrate utilization. Most, however, will liquefy gelatin and are beta-lactamase positive. Lack of activity in standard biochemicals essentially makes phenotypic identification impossible. Confirmation of identification is usually performed by staining with polyvalent conjugates containing monoclonal antibodies against the most common clinical isolates. Therefore, recognizing Legionella morphologically on BCYE and serogrouping the isolate is the most rapid and cost-effective way to diagnose it.\n\nA urinary antigen test that detects Legionella antigens in a patient's urine is also available. Unfortunately, the test detects only L. pneumophila serogroup 1. In addition, Legionella urine antigen can remain positive for 3 months to 1 year after exposure (9) . A direct fluorescent antibody test is available to stain lung tissue and also to confirm the genus identification of a clinical isolate from a culture, as described above. Finally, serological testing is available to detect a 4-fold rise in titer from acute to convalescent sera of a patient suspected of having Legionnaires' disease. A single antibody titer of \u22651:256 used to be indicative of Legionnaires' disease pneumonia. However, it no longer is, as many asymptomatic individuals have been found to have single high titers.\n\nPCR is the current test of choice for laboratories that have selfvalidated laboratory-developed tests, as there are no FDA-cleared commercial assays (10).\n\nEpidemiological investigations have shown that (i) increased age (>50 years), (ii) smoking, (iii) male sex, (iv) history of chronic lung disease, (v) hematologic malignancies, (vi) end-stage renal disease, (vii) lung cancer, (viii) immune suppression, and (ix) diabetes are predisposing factors for acquiring Legionella (11).\n\nWhere Does Legionella Live? Table 1 shows the long list of environmental sources that have been associated with Legionella infections. In recent years, novel sources of Legionella have appeared, such as windshield wiper fluid (12) and misters in a grocery store vegetable section (13) . The one commonality to the ecology of the microbe is water. In fact, the natural habitat for Legionella is water.\n\nIn the course of doing business, our environmental laboratory has cultured Legionella from many environmental sources. Health care facilities represent a disproportionate amount of the cultures we perform. The state of Texas, where we live and work, has published Table 1 a special task force report on Legionnaires' disease because of the number of human infections found in the state (14) . Health care facilities are supposed to collect specimens for testing twice a year.\n\nLegionella grows in water sources whose higher (warmer) temperatures allow the thermotolerant bacteria to thrive and multiply. These niches include hot water tanks and domestic hot water sources. Outdoors, in ponds, lakes, and other aquatic systems, Legionella lives with and within amoebae in a symbiotic relationship (15, 16) . It grows in water at temperatures from 20\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 122\u00b0F) and particularly likes temperatures between 35\u00b0C and 46\u00b0C (95\u00b0F to 115\u00b0F). Legionella can also grow in ambient, untreated waters. These water sources may be shallow wells or non-chlorinated water tanks used for watering animals or for irrigation.\n\nAs an intracellular parasite of free-living amoebae like Acanthamoeba, Legionella survives within biofilms in building water systems. The ability to multiply inside protozoa, which was first described by Rowbotham (17) , mimics its actions in human infections, where pathogens like L. pneumophila enter the body by way of the respiratory tract, are engulfed by macrophages, and multiply inside them.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) publishes guidelines for the investigation of a Legionella outbreak in a hospital (18) ; the steps, however, could equally apply to investigations in office buildings or hotels. Table 2 shows the steps in an investigation. In addition, the CDC has published an environmental protocol (19) addressing how to select appropriate sites to sample. Whenever possible, 1 liter of water should be collected. Samples should be collected in sterile screw-cap polypropylene plastic bottles. Sodium thiosulfate should be added to neutralize any residual or free chlorine from domestic water sources. Swabs of faucets (necks and aerators) and showers (wands, necks, and heads) should be collected prior to collecting the water samples; the shafts are then broken off, and the swab is submerged in the water taken from that site. Samples should be transported back to the laboratory (ambient) in insulated coolers as protection against temperature extremes. Samples that will not reach the laboratory within 72 hours or will not be processed within 72 hours should be kept under air conditioning or refrigerated to control overgrowth of other environmental organisms.\n\nLegionella is not often sought in the air, but air samples, if needed, can be collected using BCYE agar plates in a volumetric air sampler or in a glass impinger using liquid BCYE medium. (This liquid medium is similar to that used to do Legionella blood cultures.)\n\nTo recover Legionella from water, the water should be either centrifuged (down to 10X of its initial concentration) or filtered through a 0.22-\u00b5m filter prior to inoculation onto BCYE and BCYE with polymyxin B, anisomycin, and vancomycin or BCYE with glycine, vancomycin, polymyxin B, and cycloheximide. The (10X) pellet or filter (resuspended in 1/10 of the supernatant) is then heated (20) or acid treated (HCl-KCl) to rid the sample of other hetero trophic bacteria. The culture is then incubated for 7 days; Legionella usually grows in 4 or 5 days.\n\nIf no Legionella bacteria grow in a highly suspicious setting, coculture heat enrichment can be attempted (20) . This technique takes into account the fact that Legionella bacteria may be present at low numbers in certain water samples but will continue growing inside their protozoan hosts. The remaining unconcentrated sample should be incubated at 35\u00b0C and subcultured at 2-week intervals for as long as 6 weeks. This procedure is said to increase the ultimate recovery of Legionella from positive samples by as much as 30%.\n\nThere are a number of methods to control (or inhibit, but not kill) the growth of Legionella in buildings (21) . The first method is via temperature control. If all cold (chlorinated) water is kept at \u226425\u00b0C (\u226478\u00b0F) and all hot water is kept at \u226551\u00b0C (\u2265124\u00b0F), there should not be any systemic problem with Legionella. However, in most commercial buildings, hot water is maintained at closer to 110\u00b0F because of high energy costs. Electric hot water heaters also do not heat as evenly as gas. The water temperature may be 15 to 20\u00b0F lower at the bottom of the tank than at the top of the heater. Superheating the water to >60\u00b0C (>140\u00b0F) can help dimin- ish the Legionella bioburden for short periods but must be repeated every 3 to 5 weeks. For disinfection, hospitals use 180\u00b0F water for a 2-hour flush. This is performed by zones so that patient care is not affected. Maintaining water temperatures too high (>140\u00b0F) has resulted in patient scalding incidents, so it is not a feasible or a preferred method in hospitals.\n\nThe second method is use of chlorine in the feed water for the hot water heater or hot water system. A minimum of 0.5 to 1 ppm must remain in the cold municipal water at all times for this method to work (22) . The hot water is drained, and cold, chlorinated water is used to clean and rinse the system. Then, the water is heated back to the required temperature.\n\nThe third method is hyperchlorination, or shock chlorination (23) . Shock chlorination involves raising chlorine levels to >2 ppm for at least 24 hours. Hot water heaters in school gyms, for example, can be drained. Cold water is then added, with 10 ppm chlorine, and left for 2 hours. The hot water heater is subsequently rinsed twice with cold water that has 1 to 3 ppm chlorine. Finally, the hot water heater is filled and the heat is turned back on. Hyperchlorination involves raising the residual chlorine in cold or room temperature water to \u226550 to 100 ppm for at least 24 hours. Whenever >10 ppm chlorine is used, special precautions should be taken to protect workers.\n\nThe fourth method involves copper-silver (Cu-Ag) ionization. This method is recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency and World Health Organization. This method works well in potable water distribution systems and the water that feeds the heat exchangers for recirculating hot waters systems in hospitals.\n\nThe fifth method is the use of chlorine dioxide or monochloramine. Chlorine dioxide can be added at 2 ppm for 6 hours. Monochloramine is more stable than chlorine. In addition, it penetrates biofilms where Legionella resides more effectively than chlorine. Additionally, chlorine-bromine methods are used in pools and cooling towers because bromine has a longer half-life than chlorine.\n\nLegionella can also be inactivated by ultraviolet (UV) light. However, this is not a very efficient method for eliminating a bacterium that grows and reproduces in amoebae or is sheltered in corrosion particles. If UV light is used, it must be used in conjunction with another method.\n\nDead legs of water pipes and rubber gaskets should be eliminated, and fixture components, such as, aerators, water saver shower heads, and shower wands, should be removed and cleaned frequently. Remediators, however, should keep in mind that the organic material in environmental and even domestic water often neutralizes any disinfectants and can protect the Legionella biofilm.\n\nThe CDC runs a program called the ELITE (Environmental Legionella Isolation Techniques Evaluation) program (24) . The program was established as a way for laboratories to test themselves and their protocols against unknown samples supplied by the CDC. Any laboratory can elect to participate in the ELITE program and can display its symbol (Fig. 2) as proof of proficiency. The CDC maintains a website (25) that lists proficient laboratories. ELITE member laboratories must recertify annually to remain on the list. "}
