Bacteriophage alter biogeochemical cycles through lysis of bacterial cells (D\u00edaz-Mu\u00f1oz and Koskella and Brockhurst, 2014) and impact eukaryotes that depend on bacterial populations, thus having a significant impact on the greater ecosystem. The distribution and residence time of viruses is affected by the chemistry of the water, e.g., dissolved organic matter, metals, and contaminants, but also the suspended materials, such as particulate organic matter (POM) and suspended sediment, primarily clays, which serve as substrate and habitat for biofilm-producing bacteria (Alimova et al., 2006; Alimova et al., 2009) . In fact, sediment-bearing biofilms have been shown to sequester virus particles in wetlands where they are subsequently concentrated and subject to re-release (Flood and Ashbolt, 2000) . Furthermore, bacteriophages are utilized as subsurface tracers and indicators for a variety of environmental applications (Ghanem et al., 2018; Keswick et al., 1982; Redman et al., 1997) and, therefore, their interaction with sediments may affect their quantification in hydrological experiments.\n\nAn estimated 10 31 virus particles world-wide are prevalent in both soils and aquatic systems (Breitbart and Rohwer, 2005; Weinbauer and Rassoulzadegan, 2004) . In aquatic systems, the length of time in which a virus can interact with potential hosts is largely controlled by sinking rates (Fuhrman, 1999) . These rates are strongly influenced by aggregation with suspended particles. Sediments are known to influence virus transport and survival in porous media by controlling the potential for viruses to contaminate groundwater (Jin and Flury, 2002; Chu et al., 2000) and to promote lysis of bacteria in soils (Kimura et al., 2008) . The mineralogy and size of suspended sediments affects the extent to which viruses will aggregate and sorb to sediments (Chu et al., 2000; Jin and Flury, 2002; McGechan and Lewis, 2002; Syngouna and Chrysikopoulos, 2015) . With a few recent exceptions, enveloped viruses (Block et al., 2016; Block et al., 2014) , have been largely omitted from studies of virus-sediment interaction, aggregation, and viability. Enveloped viruses possess different structural properties from nonenveloped viruses and include important plant and animal pathogens such as herpesvirus, coronavirus and Influenza A and B, all of which are found in natural and wastewaters (Batik et al., 1980; Gundy et al., 2008; Rosenberg et al., 1980; Sharp et al., 1975; Stallknecht et al., 1990a; Stallknecht et al., 1990b) .\n\nVirus particles typically range from 20 nm to 500 nm in diameter, and are therefore considered colloidal particles. For non-enveloped viruses, the surface charge is determined by the protonation/deprotonation of amino acids in the capsid (Elimelech et al., 1995) . However, for enveloped virions, surface charge is determined by envelope proteins and lipids. The colloidal interaction between virus particles and the small fraction of suspended sediments can be described by DLVO theory (Derjaguin and Landau, 1941; Verwey and Overbeek, 1948) , in which the potential between colloidal particles is the sum of the attractive van der Waals potential and the Coulomb potential (repulsive for like-charged particles and attractive for oppositely-charged particles). DLVO theory has been extended to include hydrophobic forces (van Oss, 1993; van Oss et al., 1990) .\n\nPrevious research has shown that for non-enveloped viruses, sorption is largely influenced by hydrophobicity. Puls (1999), (2000) studied the attachment of three, non-enveloped, bacteriophages, T2, MS2 and \u03c6X174 to several clay fractions and calculated the electrostatic and hydrophobic contributions to the free energy. Their calculations showed that surface hydrophobicity dictates sorption of viruses to clays. Chrysikopoulos and Syngouna (2012) looked at attachment of the bacteriophages MS2 and \u03c6X174 to kaolinite or montmorillonite, and using extended DLVO energy calculations, concluded that the virus-clay attachment was primarily through hydrophobic interaction.\n\nA study of heteroaggregation of the non-enveloped cowpea mosaic virus with colloidal hematite revealed that at pH 6, at which hematite carries a positive surface charge and the virus a negative charge, the aggregates accumulated four times as many viruses as hematite particles Vilker et al. (1994) . However, at pH 3, in which both particle types are positively charged, the aggregates contained three times as many hematite particles as virus. From these results, they concluded that attraction between the virus and hematite is mostly governed by electrostatic interactions.\n\nThe above studies all investigated non-enveloped viruses which are structurally different to viruses with lipid envelopes (e.g. influenza, paramyxovirus). In this work, we employ turbidity measurements to investigate the heteroaggregation of a model envelope virus, the bacteriophage \u03c66, with colloidal goethite and three clay minerals: illite, kaolinite and montmorillonite. \u03c66 is a member of the cystoviridae family of bacteriophage. The cystoviridae are the only phage family with an outer bi-lipid envelope. \u03c66 is a dsRNA virus whose host cell is Pseudomonas phaseolicola, a common plant pathogen. \u03c66 consists of an icosahedral nucleocapsid surrounded by a bi-lipid envelope and is therefore employed as a model for virus emergence in evolutionary studies and for human pathogens such as coronavirus (Dennehy, 2017; Mindich, 2004) . The diameter of \u03c66 is~80 nm. The \u03c66 virus carries negative charge at neutral pH (Block et al., 2014) .\n\nMontmorillonite and illite platelets both have positive charged edges and negative charged faces with an overall negative charge at neutral pH (Gonz\u00e1lez S\u00e1nchez et al., 2008; Van Olphen, 1962) . Kaolinite platelets have negatively charged faces, and at neutral pH, negatively charged edges (Gupta et al., 2011; Schroth and Sposito, 1997) . Goethite is positively charged at neutral pH (Gaboriaud and Ehrhardt, 2003; Zeltner and Anderson, 1988) .\n\nThe effect of the interaction of colloidal sediments and enveloped viruses on virus viability, the nature of that interaction is unknown. We will present aggregation rates as determined by turbidity experiments, the effect of the interaction between \u03c66 and sediments on \u03c66 infectivity, and discuss the environmental implications of our findings.\n\nIn the early stage of colloidal aggregation, suspensions consist mostly of primary particles and aggregation is a bimolecular process in which the kinetics are dominated by the merging of individual primary particles to form doublets: N + N \u2192 N 2 (Garc\u00eda- Garc\u00eda et al., 2006; Garc\u00eda-Garc\u00eda et al., 2007) . The rate equation for the loss of primary particles into doublets can be written as:\n\nwhere N(t) is the number density of particles and K is the aggregation rate constant for doublet formation. The corresponding rate equation for doublet, N 2 , formation is:\n\nIntegration of Eq. (1) gives:\n\nwhere N 0 is the number density of primary particles at t = 0. The average number of primary particles in an aggregate is \u03b7 = N 0 /N(t) and thus in the early stage of aggregation:\n\nFrom Eq. (4) it is seen that in the early growth region, aggregate growth is linear in time (Kobayashi and Ishibashi, 2011; Puertas and Nieves, 1997) .\n\nThe turbidity (\u03c4) for a system of monomeric colloidal aggregates is given by (Katz et al., 2013) :\n\nwhere L is the optical path length; k = 2\u03c0/\u03bb, is the optical wavenumber; c 0 k 4 a 6 is the scattering cross-section of a primary particle; a is the effective primary particle radius; D f is the fractal dimension of the aggregate; and r is the radius of gyration of the aggregate; \u03b7N is the number density of primary particles and is constant for each individual suspension. In the initial stage of aggregation, the aggregates are small and if the primarily particles are much smaller than the optical wavelength, kr b b1. Expanding Eq. (5), and keeping only the lowest order terms in kr, it is seen that \u03c4 \u221d \u03b7, i.e. aggregate size, and at early time, \u03c4 \u221d KN 0 t.\n\nLiu et al. (2007) considered measurements of heteroaggregation rate constants by turbidity for dispersions containing colloids of different sizes. They developed a method based on the T-matrix to evaluate changes in turbidity as two primary particles form a doublet during heteroaggregation. They also considered the effects of multiple scattering on turbidity and determined that multiple scattering effects are not significant when the relative volume of the scatterers is b0.1%.\n\nIn the case of heteroaggregation of two distinct primary particles, e.g. viruses and sediments, three types of bi-molecular particle mergers are possible: sedimentsediment; virusvirus; and sedimentvirus. Eq. (2) is modified to include the three possible modes of doublet formation (Yu and Borkovec, 2002) :\n\nin which N s and N v are the number of primary sediment and virus particles in the suspension, respectively; N ss , N vv and N sv are the number of sediment-sediment, virus-virus and sediment-virus doublets, respectively; and K ss , K vv and K sv are the rate constants for sedimentsediment, virusvirus, and sedimentvirus doublet formation, respectively. The light extinction for a system of heteroaggregation is given by a modification of Eq. (5):\n\nwhere a eff is an effective primary particle radius, and the scattering cross-section, c 0 , is an average cross-section weighted by the concentrations of each type of primary particle in the aggregate. As in the case of mono-colloidal systems at early times, i.e. early stage of aggregation, kr b b1 and, keeping only terms in kr, \u03c4 is proportional to \u03b7.\n\nPurified cystovirus \u03c66 was prepared following the procedure described in Katz et al. (2012) . After purification, the virus was resuspended in buffer A, modified to have a reduced divalent cation concentration (10 mM KH 2 PO 4 and 0.5 mM MgSO 4 ). It was confirmed by counting plaque forming units (PFU) of P. phaseolicola infection that \u03c66 survives in the modified buffer for several days at room temperature.\n\nThe four mineral types chosen for this study were goethite, kaolinite (City College of New York Rock and Mineral Collection); illite, and montmorillonite (Wards Science, Rochester, NY). Composition and purity of mineral specimens was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction (City College of New York). All sediments were first crushed into powders and each washed with a 5% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) solution overnight to remove any possible organic matter or microbial contaminants. Sediments were then washed multiple times in distilled water to remove the sodium hypochlorite residue. The small clay fraction (b0.2 \u03bcm) was separated by centrifugation in a Sorvall ultracentrifuge (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) with an SS34 rotor at 5000 rpm (3000 g) for 1440 s (montmorillonite), 1140 s (illite), 1200 s (kaolinite) or 720 s (goethite). The supernatants containing the small fraction were collected and sterilized by autoclaving at 121\u00b0C and 100 kPa above atmospheric pressure for 1800 s to eliminate possible bacterial contamination.\n\nTurbidity measurements were performed at 20\u00b0C and pH = 7 with the aggregates in a 1 cm optical path length quartz cuvette. Specimens were illuminated with a broadband halogen lamp (HL2000, Ocean Optics, Inc., Dunedin, FL.) coupled to an optical fiber. Spectra were collected in the wavelength range of 400 nm to 1000 nm. The transmitted light was collected by a second optical fiber coupled to a spectrophotometer equipped with a CCD (HR2000, Ocean Optics, Inc.) which transferred the data to a personal computer. A 1 mm diameter aperture positioned in front of the collection fiber limited data collection to transmitted light while blocking scattered light. A magnetic stirrer was employed to prevent settling of the suspended colloidal aggregates. The distance between the cuvette and aperture was 5 cm, limiting the collection solid angle to 0.00003 sr and thus restricting the intensity of forward scattered light incident on the collection fiber (Katz et al., 2013) . For time-resolved measurements, each spectrum was integrated for 250 ms using a high-speed data acquisition mode which allowed rapid collection and transfer of many spectra (3600 spectra for the typical 900 s experiment) to a PC with no dead-time between spectra acquisitions. For the estimation of \u03c66 concentration by turbidity, spectra were integrated for 30 s.\n\nThe \u03c66 concentration was estimated from turbidity, approximating the \u03c66 virions as spheres with a refractive index of 1.45 and a diameter of 80 nm. The \u03c66 turbidity is given by (Ch\u00fdlek and Li, 1995; Xu, 2003; Xu et al., 2003) :\n\nwhere C s is the scattering cross section; N v is the \u03c66 concentration; L is the optical path length; n w is the refractive index of water; n v is the refractive index of \u03c66; r is the radius of \u03c66; and \u03bb is the optical wavelength. \u03c66 is sufficiently small compared to the wavelength of visible light so that higher order terms can be ignored. Based on the measured turbidity, the stock \u03c66 concentration was determined to be 7.8 \u00d7 10 11 cm \u22123 , prior to the 2\u00d7 dilution incurred when mixed with an equal volume of suspended sediments. This estimate is slightly larger than the estimate from counting PFUs (6.8 \u00d7 10 11 cm \u22123 ) but is likely more accurate as it also includes virions rendered non-infectious due to envelope defects. \u03c66, due to its lower refractive index and smaller size, scatters less efficiently than the selected sediments. Therefore, for the heteroaggregation turbidity experiments, the \u03c66 concentration was adjusted to have a lower turbidity than the turbidity at the lowest sediment concentration. The \u03c66 stock suspension was diluted to have a turbidity of 0.128 at 750 nm.\n\nHeteroaggregation experiments were performed by mixing 1 ml of suspended \u03c66 with 1 ml of each suspended sediment. This resulted in a further 50% dilution of the cation concentration (5 mM KH 2 PO 4 and 0.25 mM MgSO 4 ). Due to both the larger volume of the sediment primary particles (~0.2 \u03bcm) and higher refractive index. Refractive indices of the three sediment types are (geometric mean of the three axes): goethite: n = 2.18; illite: n = 1.58; kaolinite: n = 1.56; montmorillonite: n = 1.55 (Deer et al., 1992; Shannon et al., 2002; Weidler and Friedrich, 2007) compared to \u03c66 particles (80 nm), the sediment primary particles have a higher scattering cross-section than the virions. Therefore, the heteroaggregation experiments were performed using a higher concentration of viral particles than sediments. The sediment concentrations were adjusted to have a turbidity of~0.6 (after 2\u00d7 dilution by addition of virus suspension) at 750 nma wavelength in which light extinction losses are primarily due to scattering rather than absorption. The concentrations were chosen so that the total volume of the scatterers was b0.1% of suspension volume, thus staying in the single scattering regime and keeping the incidence of multiple scattering small (Katz et al., 2013; Wind and Szymanski, 2002; Xu and Sun, 2010) , while still providing a reasonable signal-to-noise level. The sediment and virus concentrations after the 2\u00d7 dilution are summarized in Table 1 .\n\nAfter completion of the turbidity measurements, the suspensions were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm (16,000 g) for 600 s. The centrifugation was sufficient to pellet the smallest heteroaggregates (i.e. doublets) and individual sediment primary particles but not individual virions. The pellets were resuspended in buffer and both the resuspended pellets and supernatants were analyzed for the presence of \u03c66 proteins by SDS-PAGE.\n\nThe separated heteroaggregate pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Studier, 1973) . The fraction of \u03c66 in the pellets was estimated by analyzing the relative densities of the P1, P2 and P3 protein bands of the heteroaggregate pellets and supernatants. It is noted that the SDS-PAGE experiment does not resolve P1 and P2 due to the closeness of their molecular weight (85 kDa and 75 kDa, Table 1 Concentrations of colloidal particles.\n\nPrimary particles cm \u22123 Goethite 0.096 5.3 \u00d7 10 9 Illite 1.9 9.6 \u00d7 10 10 Kaolinite 0.66 3.9 \u00d7 10 10 Montmorillonite 1.6 9.6 \u00d7 10 10 \u03c66\n\n3.9 \u00d7 10 11 respectively). P1 is the largest molecular weight protein in \u03c66 and has a relatively high copy number (120 per virion). Thus, P1 is the highest density SDS-PAGE band of all the \u03c66 proteins. Viable virus concentrations after aggregation were calculated using the plaque assay technique. The pelleted aggregates were vortexed prior to plaquing to disaggregate the mixture and separate the viruses from the sediments. The supernatants and final, disaggregated, clay suspensions were spot checked on plates with growing P. phaseolicola to determine number of virions in the system.\n\nHeteroaggregates from the isolated pellets (Section 3.3.3) were prepared for TEM using standard techniques. Samples were negatively stained with uranyl acetate. A minimal amount of stain was employed to reduce the effect of the stain on abundant viral proteins, which would impede identification of viral particles. Micrographs of the heteroaggregates were acquired with a Zeiss 902 TEM operating at 80 keV with a 2048 \u00d7 2048 pixel detector. Magnification was 85,000\u00d7 corresponding to 0.512 nm/pixel. \u03c66 particles are identifiable in the micrographs from size and morphology. Micrograph insets presented in the Results Section were re-sampled 4:1 using CorelDraw (Version \u00d78, Corel Corp, Ottawa, Can) to reduce pixelation in the enlarged insets. The contrast of the insets were enhanced using CorelDraw's autoadjust function.\n\nPrior work (Block et al., 2014) has demonstrated that \u03c66 does not aggregate in buffer A at neutral pH, therefore K vv = 0 (Eq. (6)). It was next confirmed by turbidity measurements that, individually, the four suspended sediments do not aggregate in the dilute buffer. The time evolution of the sediment turbidities at 750 nm, measured over a 900 s time period, are plotted in Figs. 1(A-D) . The turbidities remained constant for these measurements, confirming that the cation concentration in the buffer is sufficiently dilute so as to not cause the sediments to aggregate. Thus, K ss in Eq. (6) can be taken to be \u22480 and Eq. (6) simplifies to:\n\ni.e. primarily hetero-doublets are being formed at early time rather than virus-virus or sediment-sediment doublets. In this case, from Eq. (7), d\u03c4 dt \u221dK dNsv dt , i.e. the rate of hetero-doublet formation.\n\nThe turbidity of the heteroaggregates at 750 nm is plotted in Fig. 2  (A-D) . The \u03c66-goethite and \u03c66-kaolinite heteroaggregates demonstrated a linearly increasing turbidity over the entire 900 s time frame of the experiments, indicating that aggregation remained in the linear range, i.e. early stage, and consisted primarily of doublet formation. The turbidity slopes for \u03c66-goethite and \u03c66-kaolinite were 2.98 \u00d7 10 \u22125 \u00b1 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u22127 s \u22121 and 2.84 \u00d7 10 \u22125 \u00b1 2.2 \u00d7 10 \u22127 s \u22121 , respectively. The respective linear fits to the turbidity are shown in Fig. 2A and C as dotted lines. The least squares linear fit was performed using OriginPro software (OriginLab, Northampton MA, USA). In both the \u03c66-illite and \u03c66-montmorillonite heteroaggregates the duration of the linearly increasing turbidity was significantly shorter (30 s for \u03c66-illite and 15 s for \u03c66-montmorillonite). The early stage turbidity changes for illite and montmorillonite, along with linear fits, are plotted in Fig. 3 . The corresponding slopes during the linear region (primarily doublet formation) are 4.94 \u00d7 10 \u22123 \u00b1 1.9 \u00d7 10 \u22124 s \u22121 for \u03c66montmorillonite and 7.50 \u00d7 10 \u22124 \u00b1 2.9 \u00d7 10 \u22125 s \u22121 for the \u03c66-illite aggregates.\n\nExact calculations of the heteroaggregation rates from turbidity require knowledge of the scattering cross-sections of both singlets and the doublet (Liu et al., 2007; Yu and Borkovec, 2002 ). The precise shape of the virus-clay platelet doublet is not well known though there is evidence that virusclay platelet doublets occur as both edge-attached and face-attached (Block et al., 2014) . Although imprecise knowledge of doublet shape complicates calculations of heteroaggregation rates, analysis of the turbidity slope coupled with particle concentrations allows one to determine relative aggregation rates between \u03c66 and the four sediment types, elucidating the nature of the interaction.\n\nFrom the aggregation rates, it is observed that doublet formation occurs at a much slower rate for goethite and kaolinite compared to montmorillonite and illite. That the two positively charged sediments (goethite and kaolinite) aggregate more slowly with the negatively charge virions than the two negatively charged sediments (montmorillonite and illite), it is likely that the interaction between \u03c66 and the sediments is not electrostatic in nature but hydrophobic, similar to that observed for MS2 and \u03c6X174 (Chrysikopoulos and Syngouna, 2012) .\n\nThe SDS-PAGE of the pellets and supernatants for the four heteroaggregates are plotted in Fig. 4A along with the non-aggregated \u03c66 control. Comparisons of the density profiles of the P1 and P3 protein bands (Fig. 4B) reveal that for all four heteroaggregates, most of the virions aggregated with the sediments (montmorillonite 80%; kaolinite 73%; illite 76%; goethite 68%) and the remaining non-aggregated virions in the supernatant. It is expected that formation of larger aggregates resulting from either higher cation concentrations or greater sediment concentrations would result in a greater fraction of the virions aggregating. It should be noted that the SDS-PAGE results do not provide information as to virus viability, since the proteins in partially disassembled virions will likely remain intact and thus appear in their respective SDS-PAGE bands.\n\n\u03c66 viability in the supernatants and pellets as determined by plaquing is presented in Fig. 5a . The distribution of virions (viable and non-viable) is shown in Fig. 5b . The viable virus population in the control was 3.5 \u00d7 10 11 , in good agreement with our estimates from turbidity (which includes non-infectious virions). \u03c66 in the montmorillonite aggregates displayed a significant decrease in infectivity for both virions in the aggregates (14% viable) and planktonic cells (35% viable), which is consistent with results from our previous work (Block et al., 2014) . In the \u03c66-kaolinite and \u03c66-illite aggregates, the virions in the pellets, i.e. aggregated virions, show an appreciable loss in infectivity (14% and 27% of original virus populations remained viable for kaolinite and illite, respectively), while virions that did not aggregate remained close to 100% viable. For the \u03c66-goethite heteroaggregates, 49% of the virions in the pellets remained viable, while supernatant virion viability was near 100%. The higher viability values for in the \u03c66-goethite pellet is likely due to fewer virions aggregating as a result of the lower goethite concentration required to achieve approximately equal turbidity as in the experiments with clay minerals to account for goethite's greater refractive index.\n\nAnalysis of TEM micrographs confirmed the presence of \u03c66 in each of the four heteroaggregate suspensions. The viruses were observed to be attached to both platelet faces and edges of the three clay minerals. Distortion of the virus morphology was evident in the micrographs (Figs. 6A-D). In the \u03c66goethite heteroaggregates, the virions appear hexagonal with a 55 nm diameter (Fig. 6A ). This morphology is consistent with that in micrographs of the icosahedral nucleocapsid (Alimova et al., 2015) , indicating that the viral envelope has been disassembled during aggregation with goethite.\n\nAnalysis of TEM micrographs of \u03c66 heteroaggregated with the three clay minerals (Figs. 6B. \u03c66illite; 6C. \u03c66kaolinite; 6D. \u03c66montmorillonite) reveal substantial distortion in the \u03c66 morphology. The viral particle diameters are similar to the 55 nm diameter of the nucleocapsid rather than the 80 nm diameter of the intact virions and the virions appear to be distinctly non-circular. The morphologic changes indicate that the sediments partially disassembled the viral envelopea process likely responsible for the reduced rate of virus infectivity.\n\nTurbidity measurements on dilute combinations of bacteriophage \u03c66 and four sediment types were collected to determine the relative rates of heteroaggregation. Negatively charged sediments aggregated with \u03c66 at a faster rate than positively charged sediments, indicating that the interaction is not electrostatic, but hydrophobic in nature. Because K, the rate constant, is independent of concentration, the relative rates for aggregation at low turbidity are a good predictor of rates at higher concentrations.\n\nFor all experiments, most of the virions aggregated with sediments regardless of mineral type. At higher sediment concentrations, we expect an even larger viral fraction to aggregate, resulting in higher deposition rates. Nevertheless, at the low concentrations of our experiments, heteroaggregated viruses experienced a loss of infectivity. Despite the fragility of the viral envelope, a large number of virions remained viable, indicating that small-sized heteroaggregates may pose an infection risk. While non-aggregated virions in the \u03c66goethite, \u03c66 -kaolinite and \u03c66illite suspensions remained near 100% viable, in the \u03c66montmorillonite suspensions, a substantial fraction (35%) of the non-aggregated \u03c66 also lost viability. TEM analysis revealed that the observed reduction in infectivity is likely due to partial disassembly of the viral envelope after aggregation. In conclusion, it is expected that viral disassembly and loss of infectivity is likely to be exacerbated with increased contact between virions and sediments which occurs within larger aggregates.\n\nThe formation of sediment-virus heteroaggregates and subsequent virus inactivation has potential implications for remediation, spread of disease, and management of wastewater particularly during reintroduction via porous media into groundwater systems. Our results suggest that soils containing clay minerals, and in particular, montmorillonite, may potentially serve to inactivate viruses possessing a rigid lipid envelopes during colloidal transport. However, our results also show that even in the case of viruses that are not inactivated by association with a solid phase, colloidal sediments could facilitate the transport of viruses into aquifers as small heteroaggregates. Furthermore, because multiple virions aggregate with colloidal sediment even in dilute concentrations, forming heteroaggregates in the colloidal size range, this interaction must be considered in conjunction with specific infectivity (Ghanem et al., 2018) when phages are used in tracer experiments."}
