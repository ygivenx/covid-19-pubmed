{"title": "Profile of Specific Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2: The First Report", "body": ". Except for two patients (2 days and 3 days after symptoms onset), all included patients had IgM and IgG tests after 2 weeks from symptoms onset. We and was not detectable on 3 months after onset of symptoms. IgG were persistently detectable up to 24 months. 8 Our results suggested that the profile of specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV. Detectable and continuous high level of IgM indicated the acute phase of infection. Furthermore, IgM last more than a month indicating the prolonged virus replication in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. IgG responded later than IgM and persisted high in our study, indicating the humoral immune reaction to protect the body against SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n\nThe detection and profile of specific antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 will provide valuable information for rapid screening of suspects, assist diagnosis and evaluate the disease course. Furthermore, concentrated IgG antibody may be informative in vaccine development and treatment for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nFunding No funding resources to declare for this study.\n\nAll authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.\n\nInformed consent Oral consent was obtained from patients involved before enrollment when data were collected retrospectively.
