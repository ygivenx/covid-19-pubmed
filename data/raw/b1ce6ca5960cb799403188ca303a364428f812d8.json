{"title": "Direct nucleic acid analysis of mosquitoes for high fidelity species identification and 1 detection of Wolbachia using a cellphone 2 3", "body": "One biocontrol countermeasure gaining traction for mosquito control is the release of Wolbachia-74 infected mosquitoes [7] [8] [9] . Wolbachia is a maternally-transmitted endosymbiont that can rapidly 75 become established in the natural mosquito populations and can inhibit a variety of pathogens, 76 including arboviruses, malaria parasites, and filarial nematodes [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Wolbachia control 77 strategies are currently being deployed into the field to alter the capacity of Aedes aegypti to transmit 78 arboviruses or to suppress mosquito populations [16] [17] [18] . Surveillance of transinfected mosquitoes 79 as well as natural vector populations is crucial to evaluate the efficacy of these interventions [19] . 80\n\nHowever, most current screening methods rely on PCR, which is expensive and relies on 81 laboratory facilities. In addition to screening for Wolbachia infection, it would also be desirable to 82 identify the host mosquito species using these assays since different mosquito species differ in 83 their ability to transmit pathogens [20] . Knowledge of vector species, and prevalence and stability 84 of Wolbachia is essential for effective vector control and pre-emption of disease outbreaks with 85 public health measures [21] . 86\n\nUnfortunately, mosquitoes are most commonly identified using morphological taxonomic keys. 87\n\nThis process can be tedious, and requires highly trained personnel and undamaged mosquitoes. 88\n\nAlternative morphological methods such as the identification of morphometric wing characters 89\n\n[22] are low throughput and require microscopes and complex imaging instruments. Moreover, 90 were selected and maintained in an E. coli Top10 strain. Plasmid minipreps were prepared from 142 these strains using the Qiagen miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). All target inserts were 143 verified by sequencing at the Institute of Cellular and Molecular Biology Core DNA Sequencing 144\n\nFacility. 145\n\nWolbachia wAlbB and wPip strain wsp genes and Ae. aegypti coi gene sequences were obtained 147 from NCBI GenBank. Consensus signature sequences were derived following MUSCLE 148 The Primer Explorer v5 primer design software (Eiken Chemical Co., Japan) was used for 154 generating several potential LAMP primer sets composed of the outer primers F3 and B3 and the 155 inner primers FIP and BIP. Primer design was constrained to include at least a 40 bp gap between 156 the F1 and F2 or between the B1 and B2 priming sites. Primer specificity for targeted sequence 157 and a corresponding lack of significant cross-reactivity to other nucleic acids of human, vector or 158 pathogenic origin were further assessed using NCBI BLAST. 159\n\nThese primer sets were functionally tested in LAMP assays using zero to several hundred copies 160 of purified plasmids as templates.

Of the two target derived loop 166 regions (between the F1c and F2, and the B1c and B2 primer binding sites) the regions between 167\n\nF1c and F2 were chosen as wsp and coi OSD binding regions. Fluorogenic OSD probes were 168 designed using the NUPACK software and our previously described engineering principles [39] . 169\n\nBriefly the hemiduplex OSDs were designed to display 11-12 nucleotide long single-stranded 170 toeholds on the longer, fluorophore-labeled strands.

First, OSD probes were prepared by annealing 1 \u00b5M of the 196 fluorophore-labeled OSD strand with 5 \u00b5M of the quencher-labeled strand in 1X Isothermal buffer. Annealing was performed by denaturing the oligonucleotide mix at 95 \u00b0C for 1 min followed by 198 slow cooling at the rate of 0.1 \u00b0C/s to 25 \u00b0C. Excess annealed probe was stored at -20 \u00b0C. 199\n\nAnnealed OSD probes were added to the LAMP reactions at a final concentration of 100 nM of 200 the fluorophore-bearing strand. 201\n\nLAMP-OSD assays intended for visual readout and smartphone imaging were assembled in 0.2 203 ml optically clear thin-walled tubes with low auto-fluorescence (Axygen, Union City, CA, USA). 204\n\nFollowing 90 min of amplification at 65 \u00b0C, LAMP-OSD reactions were incubated at 95 \u00b0C for 1 205 min followed by immediate transfer to room temperature and fluorescence imaging.

Four to seven day old 217 mosquitoes were collected and immediately frozen for shipment, storage and subsequent testing. 218\n\nTo obtain blood fed insects, Aedes mosquitoes were starved for a period of 24 hours then offered 219 a sheep blood meal (Colorado Serum Company, Denver, CO, USA) using a hemotek membrane 220 system (Hemotek). Unfed mosquitoes were separated and mosquitoes that were engorged were 221 collected 24 hours post feeding and processed in the same manner as unfed mosquitoes. For 222 field collections, female mosquitoes were trapped using Fay prince trap (John W. Hock) baited 223 with CO2 in Galveston, Texas. 90 mosquitoes were morphologically identified and sorted into 224 three blinded groups that were stored at -20 \u00b0C, 4 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C, respectively for up to 3 weeks 225 prior to LAMP-OSD analysis. 226\n\nFor LAMP-OSD analysis individual mosquitoes were prepared either in 1 cc syringes or in 1.5 ml 228 microcentrifuge tubes as follows. In-syringe preparation: The plunger was removed from a 1 cc 229 syringe and a 0.5 \u00b5M pore size 1/8 th inch diameter frit (catalog # 59037, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, 230 MO, USA) was placed inside the syringe.

A 2 \u00b5l aliquot of this sample was directly tested by 234 LAMP-OSD assays. In-tube preparation: A single mosquito was placed in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge 235 tube and manually macerated using a disposable micropestle (Fisherbrand\u2122 RNase-Free 236\n\nDisposable Pellet Pestles, Cat # 12-141-364, Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA). Each 237 macerated mosquito was resuspended in 100 \u00b5l water. A 2 \u00b5l 1:10 diluted aliquot of this mosquito 238 sample was directly assessed by LAMP-OSD analysis. 239\n\nThe paired results of morphological identification and LAMP-OSD analysis were compared using 241 2x2 contingency tables. Sensitivity or true positive rate was calculated by using the formula 242 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. With a single endpoint visual 'yes/no' readout of OSD fluorescence (either directly observed or 277 imaged using cellphone camera), the Ae. aegypti coi LAMP-OSD assay could reliably identify 278 the presence of as few as 4 copies of synthetic target DNA (Fig 1) .

In the absence of target DNA, neither assay generated 281 spurious signal. 282 Our next goal was to demonstrate the ability of these LAMP-OSD assays to detect naturally 290 occurring target sequences in mosquitoes. At the same time, we wanted to ensure that 291 minimally processed samples would be compatible with our detection platform in order to 292 facilitate rapid in-field vector testing with fewest instruments and user-required steps. 293 Therefore, as an initial approach, we developed the 'in-syringe' method for rapid sample 294 preparation wherein individual mosquitoes were crushed inside 1 cc syringes using the syringe 295 plunger as a pestle. A small chromatography column frit placed inside the syringe served as a 296 pedestal that aided maceration and removed larger particulates when the macerated sample 297 was re-suspended in water and recovered. Small portions (up to 8% of a LAMP-OSD reaction) 298 of these macerated samples were added directly to LAMP-OSD reactions, which were then 299 incubated for 90 min at 65 \u00b0C to initiate and sustain amplification. 300\n\nEndpoint visual examination of these assays for the presence or absence of OSD fluorescence 301 revealed that our visually read LAMP-OSD system is compatible with direct analysis of crudely 302 All rights reserved.

We also confirmed the absence of significant inhibition of amplification and signaling 330 by recapitulating the detection limit of synthetic DNA targets in a background of crude non-331 specific mosquito sample. The coi and wsp LAMP-OSD assays could detect 4 and 40 target 332 copies, respectively, even in the presence of 8% reaction volume of crude mosquito sample (S5 333 blood meal could be directly analyzed by visual LAMP-OSD without diminution of signal to noise 342 ratio (Fig 3) . 343 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/291849 doi: bioRxiv preprint served as controls for monitoring background fluorescence. LAMP-OSD fluorescence was 350 imaged at endpoint using a cellphone. 351 albopictus, and Ochlerotatus species. The mosquitoes were divided into three groups of 30 356 individuals that were stored without desiccant at -20 \u00b0C, 4 \u00b0C, or 37 \u00b0C for 1, 2, or 3 weeks prior 357 to testing. To reduce mosquito processing cost, footprint, and time for this large study, we 358 further simplified sample preparation requirements by optimizing the \"in-tube\" mosquito 359 preparation method wherein each mosquito was crushed with a micropestle directly in a 360 microcentrifuge tube followed by resuspension in water and introduction in a LAMP-OSD 361\n\nThe visually read coi LAMP-OSD assay demonstrated an overall sensitivity (true positive rate) 363 of 97% and specificity (true negative rate) of 98% when compared to morphological typing of 364 field-caught mosquito species (Fig 4, S6, S7, S8) . On closer inspection of the data, it is evident 365 that even after three weeks of mosquito collection and storage at temperatures as high as 37 \u00b0C 366 the coi LAMP-OSD assay was correctly able to identify 29 out of 30 Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. 367\n\nThe single mosquito that the LAMP-OSD assay failed to identify had been stored at 37 \u00b0C for a 368\n\nweek prior to testing. We ruled out lack of amplifiable nucleic acids or their incompatibility with 369 coi LAMP primers and OSD probe by PCR amplifying the relevant coi LAMP target and verifying 370 its sequence. 371 372 All rights reserved.

By using our one-pot LAMP-OSD assay, macerated mosquito homogenates could be directly 455 analyzed and 'yes/no' visual readouts could be quickly ascertained with a cell phone in the field 456 without the requirement for laboratory equipment or technically training. Moreover, since our 457 assays can accurately analyze mosquitoes several days after capturethe coi LAMP-OSD assay 458 could for example identify mosquitoes after 3 weeks at 37 \u00b0C without desiccantmosquitoes from 459 remote collection outposts can potentially be analyzed even after delayed retrieval. The flexibility 460 of assay timing is further accommodated by the fact that lyophilized LAMP-OSD reaction mixes 461 that can be stored and deployed without cold chain [42] . These combined features make our 462 assay platform the best tool to date for expanding vector surveillance to resource poor settings 463\n\n[72], especially in that the ease of use should allow minimally trained citizen scientists to 464 participate in otherwise sophisticated public health monitoring operations in the field. 465\n\nThe development efforts that we have put into LAMP-OSD should now allow it to be generalized 466 to screening other microbes or mosquito phenotypes in field settings.
