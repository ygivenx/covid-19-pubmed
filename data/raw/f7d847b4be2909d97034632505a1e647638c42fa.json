{"title": "", "body": "MC38-hCD46 cells were infected with indicated MeVac variants at MOI 3. After 24 h, cells were lyzed by one freeze-thaw cycle. As control, MC38-hCD46 cells were loaded with SIINFEKL peptide and then lyzed (MC38-hCD46 SIINFEKL). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation. DC2.4 cells were inoculated with lysates or pulsed with SIINFEKL peptide for one hour (bottom row, right panel) and flow cytometry for SIINFEKL bound to H-2K b was performed with a PE-labeled antibody."}
