{"title": "Immune regulation of the unfolded protein response at the mucosal barrier in viral infection", "body": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network of branching tubules that extends throughout the cytoplasm of the cell and serves multiple functions. Once protein is translated by ER\u2010associated ribosomes, it enters into the ER lumen and is folded in a chaperon\u2010assisted manner. Additional complex modifications occur before the protein is transported to Golgi. Appropriate protein folding and post\u2010translational modification are crucial for protein function. Aggregated misfolded proteins in the ER cause cellular stress, which if unresolved can lead to cell death. Despite the stringent regulation around protein folding and redundancy within the chaperone\u2010assisted folding process, both endogenous and exogenous triggers can disrupt the ER homeostasis and increase protein misfolding. These triggers include but are not limited to nutrient deprivation, hypoxia and disruption by chemical inhibitors of polypeptide N\u2010linked glycosylation (e.g. tunicamycin) or calcium flux (e.g. thapsigargin), oxidative stress and infection. As a result, the ER has evolved a regulatory network, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), to control the protein folding process. The UPR activation involves three major downstream effects including reduction in protein synthesis to reduce ER load, enhancement of ER protein folding capacity and upregulation of ER\u2010associated protein degradation (ERAD). If homeostasis is not regained, the UPR will redirect the balance of signalling to favor autophagy or apoptosis. It is increasingly recognised that the evolutionary conserved UPR signalling has an important role in mucosal inflammation and infection. In this review, we discuss the role of the UPR in maintaining mucosal epithelial cell integrity and barrier function and highlight how the UPR is regulated by the host innate immunity.\n\nThe dissociation of GRP78 allows IRE1 dimerisation and activation of C\u2010terminal endoribonuclease activity, which non\u2010canonically splices a 26\u2010base pair intron from the X\u2010box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA to produce the spliced form of XBP1 (sXBP1). This spliced form of XBP1 then translates into a transcription factor, which further translocates into the nucleus where it induces expression of a wide variety of genes including ER\u2010associated chaperones and protein folding enzymes to increase ER size and folding capacity. A separate IRE1\u03b1\u2010dependent decay of mRNA (RIDD) pathway is also described (Figure 1).1 RIDD degrades mRNAs to ultimately reduce ER load and subsequently reduce the UPR activation. However, with prolonged ER stress IRE1\u03b1 becomes hyperactive and degrades mRNAs associated with anti\u2010apoptotic responses, promoting cell death. IRE1\u03b2 (also known as ERN2) is abundantly expressed by intestine and lung epithelial cells.2 Compared to IRE1\u03b1, the role of IRE1\u03b2 in the UPR is not very well studied. IRE1\u03b2 may also be associated with RIDD,3 which is closely related to intracellular parasite infections and anti\u2010viral responses at mucosal surface.4\n\n\nUpon dissociation from GRP78, the transmembrane kinase PERK is activated by oligomerisation and autophosphorylation. PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), which inhibits ribosome assembly leading to the inhibition of global protein translation, reducing ER load. Although protein translation is halted under ER stress conditions, translation of specific mRNAs is not subject to inhibition. For example, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) escapes translation inhibition, which ultimately leads to expression of genes that regulate amino acid metabolism and autophagy (discussed later).5 Activated ATF4 in turn induces expression of GADD34, a phosphatase which regulates eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Once ER stress is resolved, eIF2\u03b1 is dephosphorylated by GADD34\u2013protein phosphatase 1 complex to restore global protein synthesis.\n\nAfter sensing misfolding proteins, GRP78 disengages from ATF6\u03b1 or \u03b2 isoforms. ATF6 translocates from ER to the Golgi apparatus where it is cleaved by resident proteases sphingosine\u20101\u2010phosphate and sphingosine\u20102\u2010phosphate (S1P and S2P, respectively) to produce a cytosolic ATF6p50 fragment. The ATF6p50 fragment then translocates to the nucleus to modulate gene expression relating to increased ER folding capacity and ERAD pathway activation.6, 7\n\n\nThe three branches of UPR signalling have reasonably distinct downstream functions, but they are engaged in a coordinated fashion and can act together. For example, XBP1 transcription can be induced by ATF6, and increased IRE1\u03b1 expression is dependent on PERK\u2010ATF4 pathway,8 suggesting the complex interplay and cross\u2010regulation between the three branches of UPR pathway (Figure 1).\n\nAutophagy maintains cellular homeostasis and is involved in MHC class I and II presentation of cytoplasmic and nuclear antigens, which we have reviewed previously.8 In response to irreversible ER stress, the terminal UPR can activate autophagy to break down the terminally misfolded proteins. During the autophagy process, cellular components are encapsulated within autophagosomes and directed for controlled degradation. Different UPR branches can signal through and induce autophagy, including PERK\u2010eIF2\u03b1 as well as IRE1\u03b1 pathways (Figure 1). Transcription factor ATF4 that escapes PERK\u2010associated translation inhibition activates transcription of CHOP in cells experiencing persistent ER stress.5 ATF4 and CHOP can form a heterodimer to activate cellular death pathways and induce expression of a large array of autophagy\u2010related genes.9\n\n\nDefects in the UPR and autophagy pathways have synergistic effects. XBP1 is crucial in autophagy induction in some settings, for instance protection from neural degeneration.10 XBP1 deletion induces only mild superficial intestinal inflammation; however, concomitant deletion of XBP1 and epithelial\u2010associated autophagy\u2010related protein 7 (ATG7) or ATG16L1 results in more severe ER stress and small intestinal inflammation.11 Supporting this, human genome wide association studies (GWAS) reveal that polymorphisms in ATG16L1 gene and defects in autophagy pathways are associated with increased risk of developing Crohn's disease, a form of inflammatory bowel disease leading to chronic inflammation.12\n\n\nAutophagy may also be a mechanism of disposing terminally damaged ER. It was thought to be a non\u2010specific process, but selective autophagy processes that target specific organelles such as mitochondria have been described. Autophagy of ER in mammalian cells was reported, but detailed mechanisms are still unknown. FAM134B, the selective autophagy receptor for ER turnover, induces selective autophagy of the ER (termed ER\u2010phagy) in mammalian cells.13 It has been suggested that FAM134B binds to microtubule\u2010associated protein 1A/1B\u2010light chain 3 (LC3) and GABA type A receptor\u2010associated protein (GABARAP), thereby initiating ER degradation through autophagy.13\n\n\nThe UPR and inflammation are interconnected on many levels. Defects in protein folding or in any of the individual branches of the UPR spontaneously induce an inflammatory response. In a clinical setting, this has been described particularly in inflammatory bowel disease8 and lung disease.8, 14 Upon sensing pathogen\u2010associated antigens, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including Toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide\u2010binding oligomerisation domain (NOD)\u2010like receptors can lead to the UPR activation and subsequent inflammation. TLR2 and TLR4 can activate IRE1\u03b1 with resultant increased sXBP1 required for optimal and sustained production of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages.11 NOD1 and NOD2 signalling can trigger the UPR activation and inflammatory cytokine IL\u20106 production from macrophages in a murine model of bacterial infection.15 ER stress and the UPR activation generate reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), which modify the redox state of the ER, triggering an inflammatory response.\n\nThe activation of NF\u03baB, key regulator for immunity and inflammatory response, is linked to the UPR. The NF\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB has a shorter half\u2010life than NF\u03baB: activation of PERK and concomitant translational inhibition through eIF2\u03b1 leads to NF\u03baB activation independent of I\u03baB phosphorylation.16 Also, IRE1\u03b1 can interact with TNF receptor activating factor 2, which recruits I\u03baB kinase leading to I\u03baB phosphorylation and NF\u03baB activation.17 It is important to note that ER stress and the UPR have been reported to influence NF\u03baB activation both positively and negatively (Figure 1). The intensity of ER stress influences NF\u03baB activation status positively;18 however, preconditioning of cells with low level of ER stress is thought to attenuate NF\u03baB activation.19\n\n\nConversely, mucosal inflammation modifies ER stress and UPR pathways. Both ROS and RNS produced by innate immune cells during inflammation can activate the UPR in target cells directly. Inflammatory cytokines such as IL\u201017A, IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u201023 initiate the UPR indirectly via inducing oxidative stress, which inhibits the production of protein disulphide isomerases, that are key components of the endoplasmic reticulum\u2010assisted folding system (ERAF), resulting in the accumulation of unfolded proteins within the ER and UPR activation.20 In contrast, cytokines, like IL\u201010 and IL\u201022, have been shown to suppress ER stress and its associated UPR activation to alleviate inflammation in intestinal mucosal system.21\n,\n21 The evolutionary benefit of the ability of cytokines to rapidly stop/start protein synthesis is unclear, but may relate to cellular defences during viral infection, as discussed later.\n\nThe intestinal epithelial barrier forms a selectively permeable immunologically tolerant but alert barrier between the sterile inside and microbe\u2010laden lumen. Mucins, the major macromolecular component of the mucus layer, are complex, highly glycosylated proteins secreted by goblet cells. Due to high secretory demand, the UPR plays an essential role in maintaining secretory cell homeostasis in the intestine. It is hard to delineate the effects of the UPR in isolation, due to the nature of the intrinsically entwined pathways. Consequently, genetically modified experimental models highlight the importance of the UPR in maintaining homeostasis.\n\nMultiple animal models show that the UPR can be pathologically activated at several points when key components such as chaperones, transcription factors or key enzymes are absent or attenuated. Deletion of the major UPR transcription factor XBP1 in intestinal epithelial cells causes loss of mature Paneth cells, reduction in goblet cells, impaired bacterial handling and increased sensitivity to dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)\u2010induced colitis.23\nErn2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice lacking ER\u2010resident endonuclease, IRE1\u03b2, have increased Grp78 levels in intestinal epithelial cells and increased Muc2 misfolding,2 which lead to increased susceptibility to DSS colitis.24 Mice deficient in ATF6 have increased expression of ER stress genes and sensitivity to DSS colitis.25 AGR2 is a protein disulphide isomerase involving in disulphide bond formation in proteins within the ER. Agr2 knockout mice have increased ER stress and suffer from a spontaneous granulomatous ileocolitis with goblet cell depletion.26, 27\n\n\nAside from direct UPR component deficiency, abnormalities in proteins sequence or glycosylation sites also lead to the UPR activation and epithelial cell stress. Single missense mutation in Muc2 gene leads to misfolding of the major secreted intestinal mucin Muc2, resulting in a strong UPR response and subsequent development of spontaneous colitis characterised by activation of both innate and adaptive immunities with an IL\u201023/TH17 phenotype.28, 29 Immune\u2010regulated alterations in mucin glycosylation following Trichuris muris infection contribute to clearance of parasitic infection.30\n\n\nBesides mucin secretion, a new underappreciated role of goblet cells (GCs) is antigen sampling through the goblet cell\u2010associated antigen passages (GAPs) under homeostatic conditions.31 Overriding GC microbial sensing to open colonic GAPs or inappropriate delivery of luminal pathogens through GAPs resulted in the influx of leucocytes and the production of inflammatory cytokines in the setting of normal, non\u2010pathogenic, microbiota.31, 32 This microbial sensing by colonic GCs has a critical role in regulating the exposure of the colonic immune system to luminal substances. Although detailed mechanisms are unknown, it presents an intriguing possibility that GC intrinsic UPR and autophagy pathways may be involved in this antigen trafficking process. Interestingly, as a host defence mechanism, GCs are able to shut off GAPs in response to intrinsic sensing of an invasive pathogen like Salmonella typhimurium via MyD88 signalling.33\n\n\nAnother secretory cell in the small intestine is the highly specialised Paneth cell, which secretes antimicrobial molecules.34, 35 The UPR plays an important role in Paneth cell production of antimicrobial peptides. Paneth cell\u2010specific Xbp1 deletion is sufficient to induce ER stress and autophagy, which results in ileitis which is reversible under germ\u2010free conditions.11 The importance of Paneth cell secreting antimicrobial peptides is highlighted in the bacterial S. typhimurium infection model. The UPR activation and associated autophagy are required to ensure antimicrobial peptide secretion from Paneth cells during infection.36 Besides the intrinsic UPR activation, extrinsic signals from innate lymphoid cells are also required.36 The UPR not only regulates Paneth cell homeostasis, but also preserves its antimicrobial peptide secretory function during infections by increasing the UPR activation threshold to limit pathogen dissemination.\n\nUPR defects within immune cells predispose to inflammation. Lamina propria\u2010resident dendritic cells (DCs) kill penetrating bacteria by phagocytosis and present bacterial antigens to adaptive T cells. NOD2\u2010 and ATG16L1\u2010mediated autophagies are required for DCs to process and present bacteria antigen via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II and I to induce CD4 and CD8 T\u2010cell response.37 Individuals carrying NOD2 and ATG16L1 polymorphisms display impaired antigen presentation in mucosal DCs and are at increased risk of developing Crohn's disease.38, 39 XBP1 is constitutively spliced in DCs, highlighting the importance of consistent UPR activation. Loss of Xbp1 in haematopoietic lineage cells results in a reduced number of DCs. The impairment can be rescued by overexpression of Xbp1 in haematopoietic progenitors.40 Loss of Xbp1 in CD11c+ cells leads to defects in phenotype, ER homeostasis and antigen presentation by CD8\u03b1+ conventional DCs. These functional defects result from IRE1\u03b1\u2010dependent degradation of mRNAs, which encode MHC class I machinery in the absence Xbp1,\n41, 42 again highlighting the crosstalk between the UPR and autophagy. Constant IRE1 pathway activation is not exclusive to DCs: developing B cells and T cells also have constitutive activation of IRE1 without activation of any of the other UPR cascades.43\n\n\nSimilar to intestinal mucosal epithelial cells, lung epithelial cells have developed many defence mechanisms to deal with environmental exposures. Increasing evidence shows that the UPR pathways interact with the recognition and handling of exogenous threats, like viruses.44 The continuous epithelium in the airways acts as a physical barrier to keep the underlying immune system separated from exogenous air\u2010borne pathogens. Ciliated cells continuously clear inhaled matter trapped by the mucus layer. Respiratory goblet cells synthesise and secrete the mucins, MUC5B and MUC5AC rather than MUC2. MUC5B/AC, and their glycoforms contribute to the elasticity and viscous nature of the mucus layer covering epithelium.45 Mice with Muc5b deficiency develop spontaneous pulmonary pathology from chronic bacterial infection.46 Distinctive to MUC5B, production of MUC5AC is often associated with pathogenesis of respiratory diseases such as asthma or lung fibrosis. In human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs), sXBP1 induced ER expansion and Ca2+ storage contributes to IL\u20108 secretion.47 IRE1\u03b2 is expressed in HBECs and is upregulated in cystic fibrosis and asthmatic HBECs. Studies with Ern2\n\u2212/\u2212 mice revealed that IRE1\u03b2 is required for airway mucin production via the activation of the transcription factor XBP1.48 In response to ER stress, IRE1\u03b2 activates its endonuclease activity to repress translation through 28S ribosomal RNA cleavage. IRE1\u03b2 is abundantly expressed in HBECs;49 hence, the IRE1\u03b2\u2010dependent mRNA degradation may be important for efficient translational repression in combating ER stress.\n\nSeveral endogenous factors can activate the UPR and hence alter the protein load of epithelial/secretory cells. However, whether the immune system can have a direct effect on epithelial cells has received little attention. Some studies have demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines can induce oxidative stress within epithelial cells.50, 51, 52 However, studies have mainly focused on epithelial cell\u2010derived cytokines and/or chemokines rather than cytokines that affect epithelial cells. We demonstrated that specific inflammatory cytokines initiate ER stress by inducing oxidative stress, while other counteracting cytokines suppress stress and facilitate ER protein folding.53 While this study focused on pancreatic \u03b2\u2010cells, we have discovered that cytokine regulation of cellular stress is common to multiple epithelial cell types including intestinal and respiratory epithelial cells. In contrast, cytokines, such as IL\u201010 and IL\u201022, suppress ER stress and UPR activation, leading to increased mucus production, improved barrier function and attenuated intestinal mucosal inflammation in experimental colitis models.52, 54\n\n\nImmunity regulates protein production and secretion by non\u2010immune cells by indirectly modulating the UPR (Figure 2). As an instructive example of the ability of cytokines to modulate protein production, recent studies in our laboratory show that in chronic infection (nematode, Trichuris muris), the amount of ER stress and consequent Muc2 biosynthesis is dictated by an intact adaptive immune response (Figure 3). ER stress occurs in mice that mount a TH1/17 response (low\u2010dose infection), which show goblet cell pathology and fail to clear the infection. However, mice that mount a TH2 response (high\u2010dose infection) show high levels of goblet cell protein biosynthesis and secretion and go on to clear the infection. These data support our hypothesis of specific cytokines modulating protein production. Interestingly, ER stress is not observed in the immunodeficient mice that have chronic T. muris infection, strengthening our hypothesis of host intrinsic\u2010induced cytokines being responsible for the activation of the UPR and induction of ER stress. We suggest that inflammatory cytokines have evolved to disrupt protein biosynthesis in cells prone to viral infection such as mucosal epithelial cells in order to reduce viral replication as a hereto\u2010unrecognised element of the immune response.\n\nBalanced and integrated ER stress and UPR signalling are crucial in maintaining intestinal mucosal homeostasis, and the immune system can either alleviate or aggravate ER stress.55 IL\u201010 produced by regulatory T cells can suppress ER stress by inhibiting the translocation of ATF6p50 to the nucleus and downstream p38 mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in intestinal epithelial cells.56 This maintains mucin production in goblet cells, preserving the mucus barrier and reducing further immune activation.54 Another regulatory\u2010related cytokine IL\u201022 reduces high\u2010fat diet\u2010associated oxidative and ER stress in intestinal epithelial cells and subsequent intestinal inflammation to improve mucosal barrier function.52\n\n\nViruses have evolved mechanisms to modulate the UPR to either suppress or exacerbate already existing ER stress in order to maximise viral protein biosynthesis, and reduce or increase inflammation (Figure 4, Table 1). Viruses rely on the host ER and the ER stress response to replicate as viral replication is severely diminished in cell lines with mutations in ER\u2010resident genes.65 On the one hand, neither human cytomegalovirus nor West Nile virus, interestingly, induce canonical ER stress pathway via induction of XBP1\u2010associated gene expression, rather they specifically trigger XBP1 for optimal cytokine production.66 Hepatitis C virus, on the other hand, activates IRE1 but inhibits XBP1 and blocks eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation to prevent upregulation of ERAD machinery in order to establish persistency in infected hepatocytes.57 Some viruses may selectively activate one arm of the UPR while suppressing other branches. Influenza A virus is found to selectively induce ATF6 translocation to promote caspase\u201012\u2010dependent cell apoptosis.67 The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activates a non\u2010canonical ER stress response with preferential activation of the IRE1 and activated ATF6 pathways without concomitant significant activation of the PERK pathway.68\n\n\nAutophagy is believed to be an ancient anti\u2010viral response. Upon evading the host, viral proteins can often be targeted by host autophagy pathway for lysosomal degradation, which promotes anti\u2010viral innate and adaptive immunities via facilitating viral protein processing and presentation to antigen\u2010presenting cells.69 It is recognised now that the autophagy pathway can play both anti\u2010viral and pro\u2010viral roles in the pathogenesis of different viruses. Some viruses can utilise autophagy proteins to foster their own growth intracellularly. Under such conditions, autophagy pathways are often served as scaffold for viral entry or served as inter\u2010cellular organelle to foster viral replication, suppressing innate immunity through insufficient viral protein presentation and preventing cell death.70 The immune system has developed alternative ways to interrupt viral protein synthesis. These include upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, such as interferons, to reinforce cellular stress and autophagy response to combat viruses.\n\nOur discovery of cytokine\u2010induced oxidative stress (ROS/NOS) within target cells provides a mechanism that bypasses this viral\u2010driven mechanism that block arms of the UPR. Innate cytokines are released quickly and dynamically. We identified selected cytokines that have a direct downstream chemical effect within the ER, which induces misfolding of viral proteins regardless of any viral blocking of the UPR (Figure 5). Translated viral proteins will misfold due to the inappropriate oxidative state in the ER, leading to host cell apoptosis and reduced virulence.\n\nThe impact of cytokines on oxidative stress and the UPR can dictate protein biosynthesis. For example, type I interferon signalling has been shown to regulate chronic hepatitis B virus infection via induction of oxidative stress in epithelial cells.71, 72, 73, 74 Anti\u2010viral effects of other cytokines such as TNF\u2010\u03b1 have also been shown to induce apoptotic pathways in infected cells. Our work shows that specific cytokines (IL\u201017, IL\u201023) locally cause ER stress, particularly in cells with an inherent susceptibility to protein misfolding or inadequate UPR.\n\nAs discussed, cytokines such as IL\u20104, IL\u201013 and IL\u201010 can boost protein production in mucin\u2010secreting goblet cells.54, 75, 76 There are several reports of correlations of cytokine levels with disease; however, limited research has been done on the direct effect of cytokines on protein biosynthesis.\n\nWhile cytokines that amplify stress may be favorable in the context of halting viral replication, inappropriate or continued activation of this pathway in the absence of overt pathogens in chronic inflammatory diseases perpetuates a cycle of stress and inflammation.77 This could result in poor barrier function, due to reduced secretion of barrier proteins and diminished epithelial integrity (Figure 5). For example, type I IFNs are essential for clearing viral infection. However, prolonged activation of type I IFNs in chronic infection leads to immune dysfunction and exacerbated tissue damage in the respiratory tract.77, 78 A careful balance is required; inducing ER stress and UPR pathways will limit viral replication and promote viral clearance in acute infection. However, prolonged ER stress and UPR activation is detrimental to mucosal barrier regeneration and renewed homeostasis.\n\nIL\u201010 is an example of the multifaceted role a single cytokine can have on viral infection and the UPR. IL\u201010 suppresses B\u2010cell antibody responses and T\u2010cell immunity; thus, its neutralisation leads to viral clearance.79 Human cytomegalovirus has been found to encode a decoy IL\u201010\u2010like cytokine, which signals through the human IL\u201010 receptor to circumvent detection and destruction by the host immune system.80 We have demonstrated that IL\u201010 suppresses the UPR in secretory goblet cells in the intestine,54 allowing for increased protein production. Therefore, along with IL\u201010\u2010mediated immunosuppressive effects on the immune cells, IL\u201010\u2010induced protein production (via the regulation of the UPR) would allow for increased viral replication in these highly productive secretory cells. Despite the negative effects of IL\u201010 in acute viral infection, the importance of IL\u201010 in attenuating chronic inflammation is unequivocal.81, 82 Regardless, these cytokines controlling secretory protein synthesis in non\u2010immune cells are an overlooked paradigm in immunity. More detailed understanding will help identify novel targets that can be modulated in acute infection and more broadly in chronic inflammatory diseases to alleviate tissue damage.\n\nEndemic and emerging viral infections cause profound morbidity and mortality, with over 13 500 hospitalisations and more than 3000 deaths per year in Australia due to influenza alone.83 Pathology in susceptible individuals is likely to involve either an inability to control the viral replication and dissemination, or the development of a local \u2018cytokine storm\u2019 damaging the mucosal epithelium. Better understanding of the contribution of ER stress\u2010associated UPR response in viral infection process, temporal sequence of events and pathways to initiation of chronic inflammation and tissue damage is imperative. Understanding how immune responses and inflammatory cytokines regulate UPR in viral infection is crucial, because boosting this physiological process via cytokines could open the way to novel approaches to limit viral replication and acute disease, and rescue individuals with persistent inflammation and associated tissue damage. Clearly, the UPR is intimately involved in viral replication: manipulating ER stress and UPR signalling could potentially limit viral replication and attenuate acute viral infections. Reduction in epithelial cell UPR activation in chronic disease provides an opportunity to limit persistent mucosal inflammation and the extent of tissue damage. The timing and nature of the cytokine response dictate time taken for both viral clearance and restoration of mucosal integrity and homeostasis. Manipulation of cytokine\u2010induced epithelial cell ER stress gives us a chance to tip this fine balance in favor of health rather than disease.\n\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest associated with this manuscript."}
