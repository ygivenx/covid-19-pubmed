{"title": "Bovine Coronavirus Antigen in the Host Cell Plasmalemma", "body": "Bovine coronavirus (BCV) infections are associated with enteric disease of viral etiology in newborn calves (Mebus et al., 1973; Doughri et al., 1976) . The envelope of BCV virions contains two types of morphologically and functionally distinct spikes containing glycoproteins (Storz et al., 1981; King et al., 1985) . The major envelope-associated glycoprotein S has a molecular mass of 185 kDa which is cleaved into Sl and S2 (100-l 10 kDa) while HE has 62 kDa in the reduced and 140 kDa in the nonreduced form. S carries the structural sites responsible for virus attachment and fusion of host cells (Collins et al., 1982; Deregt et al., 1987) . Hemagglutination of rodent red blood cells and acetylesterase activity is associated with HE of BCV (King et al., 1985; Vlasak et al., 1988; Cavanagh et al., 1990) . The integral membrane glycoprotein M has a molecular mass of 24-26 kDa. The nucleocapsid protein N is phosphorylated (King and Brian, 1982; Lapps et al., 1987) .\n\nThe initial adaptation of wild-type strains of BCV to different cultured cells is difficult but most successful in the human rectal tumor (HRT-18) cell line which was derived from an adenocarcinoma (Tompkins et al., 1974; Laporte et al., 1979; . Monolayers of these polarized epithelioid cells resemble enterocytes, the type of cells targeted by BCV in natural infections (Doughri and Storz, 1977) . Cultures of different bovine fetal cells support noncytocidal multiplication of the cell-adapted strain of BCV (Mebus et al., 1978) . Bovine fetal spleen (BFS) cells are highly susceptible to BCV-induced cell fusion if trypsin is added to the medium of infected cultures. Cell fusion depends on trypsin cleavage of the 185-kDa precursor to the lOO-to IlO-kDa Sl and S2 Storz et af., 1981; .Cavanagh et al., 1990) . This phenomenon implies that virally encoded macromolecules are expressed in the plasma membrane (White et al., 1983) . Viral proteins in the host plasma membrane are not necessary for BCV maturation because coronaviral particles are enveloped by budding into intracellular compartments (Sturman and Holmes, 1982) . Viral components at the cell surface contribute to intracellular spread of the infection by fusion with uninfected cells, and they serve as targets for immune surveillance. Immunoelectron and immunofluorescence microscopy were used in this investigation to analyze the expression of virus-specific antigen in the plasmalemma of cells infected with BCV.\n\nMonolayers of HRT-18 cells (Tompkins et al., 1974) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) buffered with 44 mM NaHCO, and supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. The D2 strain of the BFS cell line was maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) buffered with 25 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-Zethanesulfonic acid and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Working stocks of the Mebus strain L9 of BCV (Mebus et al., 1978) with lo6 to 10' p.f.u. per milliliter were prepared in HRT-18 cells.\n\nMonolayers were grown in 20-cm* solvent-resistant culture dishes for immunogold labeling experiments and in multiwell chamber slides for immunofluorescence studies. The cells were washed with serum-free medium, infected with BCV (m.o.i. = 2 to 20 p.f.u. per cell) for 60 min at 37\u00b0C covered with fresh medium, and incubated for various periods. Infected BFS cultures were incubated with and without the addition of 0.2 pg of trypsin (Type XIII, Sigma Chemical Co.), per milliliter.\n\nWe used a polyclonal rabbit antibody against purified BCV. This antiserum had a neutralization index of 4.5 and reacted in Western blots with all BCV proteins. The IgG fraction was obtained by protein-A-Sepharose column chromatography of antiserum and normal serum from rabbits.\n\nCultures for electron microscopy were fixed for 30 min at 4\u00b0C in 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.01 M NaP04, 0.14 M NaCl at pH 7.3 (PBS), washed overnight in PBS, and then treated for 10 min with 1 m&f glycylglycine to quench reactive aldehyde groups. The fixed monolayers were incubated at 4\u00b0C in rabbit anti-BCV IgG or normal rabbit IgG, washed in PBS, and then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 5-nm colloidal gold (Janssen Life Sciences Products, Beerse, Belgium). These monolayers were tixed again in 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 1 hr at 25\u00b0C posttixed for 1 h in a solution of 1% osmium tetroxide and 1% potassium ferrocyanide in PBS, washed in 0.2 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 3.5, and stained en bloc for 1 h with 0.2% uranyl acetate in acetate buffer. After being washed in distilled water, the cells were dehydrated in an ascending alcohol gradient, embedded in situ in Spurr's epoxy resin 1%9) , and polymerized at 60\u00b0C. The embedded monolayers were peeled from the plastic substrate and reembedded. Thin sections were cut in a plane perpendicular to the monolayer, stained with lead citrate, and viewed with a Zeiss EM-10 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. The density of labeling on the cell surface was quantitated by counting the number of gold particles per length of plasmalemma in thin-sectioned cells. An PAYNE, STORZ, AND HENK image analyzing system (Sigma Scan, Jandel Scientific) was employed to measure membrane length directly from electron microscope negatives. Preparations for immunofluorescence microscopy were fixed for 10 min in 4% formaldehyde in PBS with 0.005% CaCl, and 0.11 M sucrose, permeabilized for 5 min with acetone at -2O\"C, incubated with rabbit anti-BCV antibody, and reacted with goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. The preparations were viewed with a Leitz fluorescent microscope using epifluorescence. dantly at 24 hr with 9.5 ? 2.7 gold particles bound per micrometer length of plasma membrane. BCV antigen was located on both microvilli and planar portions of the apical plasma membrane. The gold particles were spatially separated in general, but observations of clustered BCV antigen in the plasma membrane were made as well. Neighboring cells without evidence of infection were practically devoid of label with fewer than 0.5 gold particles per micrometer of plasmalemma.\n\nNegative control preparations included (i) uninfected HRT-18 cells that had been incubated with anti-BCV antibody and (ii) infected cells that had been incubated with the IgG fraction of normal rabbit serum. These cells were not labeled by the gold probe, confirming that the antibody bound only to virus-specific antigen. The plasma membrane was not labeled on uninfected HRT-18 cells adsorbed at 4\u00b0C with BCV and incubated with these immunoreagents.\n\nThis observation implies that binding of whole virus or subviral components to cellular receptors did not contribute to our observation of gold association with the plasma membrane.\n\nAccumulation of BCV antigen in BFS cells. Polykaryocytosis was evident by 18 hr in infected BFS cells incubated in medium with trypsin but cell fusion was not observed in the absence of trypsin. We used immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy to correlate the onset of cell fusion with the synthesis of viral antigen.\n\nFaint fluorescence was first recognized in BFS cultures at 9 hr postinfection (Fig. 2a) . Fluorescent cells constituted 25 to 30% of the cell population at 15 and 24 hr postinfection in cultures incubated without trypsin. Cultures that were incubated with trypsin contained large polykaryons with cytoplasmic fluorescence at 24 hr (Fig. 2b) while cultures without trypsin contained only mono-and binucleated cells (Fig. 2~) . Fewer than 10% of the remaining single cells in trypsintreated cultures were nonfluorescent at 24 hr. This decrease in the number of Electron microscopic preparations revealed no evidence of membrane fusion in BFS monolayers fixed after 15 h of infection in the presence of trypsin (Fig. 3a) . At the same time, multiple sites of BCV antigen in the plasma membrane were labeled (Fig. 3b) , indicating that antigen appearance at the plasma membrane preceded the onset of cell fusion by several hours. Viral antigen did not increase in the plasma membrane after the onset of cell fusion in infected BFS cell cultures. Vesicles filled with virus particles and continuous with the plasma membrane were observed as early as 15 hr after infection in BFS cells (Fig. 3~ ). This event appeared to represent exocytosis of newly formed coronavirus particles.\n\nThe abundance of gold binding sites on polykaryons at 24 hr (Fig. 4a) was approximately equal to the number seen on BFS cells not treated with trypsin (Fig. 4b) . Evidently, the addition of trypsin did not alter the amount of viral antigen at the cell surface but influenced its function.\n\nOur results are in agreement with reports of viral proteins at the surface of cells infected with mouse coronaviruses. Collins et al. (1982) used immunoferritin electron microscopy to demonstrate that the 170-kDa protein of MHV-4 is present at the surface of infected L-241 cells at 6 hr postinfection. Other evidence for coronavirus-specific proteins at the cell surface relied on inhibition of virus-induced cell fusion by antibodies specific for envelope proteins Sturman et al., 1985) and on fusion foci experiments (Mizzen et al., 1983; Tooze and Tooze, 1985) . Our immunogold procedure directly demonstrates the presence of coronaviral antigen in the plasma membrane and extends the earlier observations to include the bovine coronavirus.\n\nWe found that BCV antigen was expressed at the surface of infected cells despite the intracellular mode of maturation for this virus. The gold-labeled sites were observed in areas free of attached vu-ions. Control preparations indicated that these sites represent de n~vo expression of virus-specific proteins in the plasma membrane.\n\nBCV-infected BFS cells are highly susceptible to fusion in contrast to BCVinfected HRT-18 cells, which are relatively resistant to fusion (Payne and Storz, 1988) . This difference in fusion capacity in the two cell types probably depends on differences in membrane structure such as the respective complements of membrane proteins, glycolipids, or the composition of the lipid bilayer (Sturman and Holmes, 1985; White et al., 1983) . Infected BFS cells failed to accumulate surface viral antigen after the onset of cell fusion, but BCV-infected HRT-18 cells accumulated increasing amounts of viral antigen on the cell surface yet these cells failed to fuse. The differences among infected BFS and HRT-18 cells in the surface expression of viral antigen and fusion might result from the kinetics and mechanisms of protein expression and the differences in the composition of the two plasma membranes.\n\nThe expression of BCV antigen in the plasma membrane has important implications for host-virus interactions. The appearance of virus-specific surface components during eclipse, for example, renders the infected cell susceptible to specific antibody-dependent or cell-mediated host defense mechanisms. Cell fusion induced by BCV may be an important mechanism for cell-to-cell spread of the infection (Mebus et al., 1978) . Here, we have shown that the appearance of viral antigen on the surface of BCV-infected cells precedes the onset of fusion. This fusion activity involves the S glycoprotein, which promotes fusion after trypsin cleavage of the 185kDa precursor to the IOO-to 1 lo-kDa Sl and S2 Payne and Storz, 1988; Cavanagh et al., 1990) . This BCV glycoprotein was thus identified by its function as a plasmalemma antigen of infected cells. The BCV hyperimmune serum used in our studies did not permit differentiation of the BCV glycoproteins. Monoclonal antibodies were not available when we initiated these investigations, which were designed to clarify whether BCV antigens are detectable at all in the plasmalemma of infected cells."}
