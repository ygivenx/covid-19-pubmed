{"title": "Linkages between Chiropteran diversity and ecosystem services for sustainable fragmented forest conservation", "body": "This data article is constructed using survey results that indicate bat diversity and their abundance in fragmented forests within Terengganu (Table 1). From these, additional associations such as new records, ecosystem services, possible pathogen carriers and their lifestyle were added from available literature for forest regeneration impacts, influence towards agriculture activities, trophic level and food web constructs, natural pest control, precursor for diseases, conservation assert (if needed) as well as their geographical tolerance and adaptations (Table 2). Chiropteran morphometric measurements are translated into weight-length data to scale their health in the wild (Table 3). These indicate food resources, its availability and its adaptation to forest fragmentations. The data is also interpret using Mathematical equations (Shannon, Simpson, Eveness, Margalef and Menhinick) to derive diversity and species richness values which are useful for chiropteran interpolations and assessments within a geographical boundary (Table 4).\n\nField visits to districts Hulu Terengganu (Saok and Lasir Waterfalls), Setiu (Setiu Research Station) and Besut (Gunung Tebu Forest Reserve) were carried out in June 2017 and spanned six days at each site. While four-bank harp and mist nets were used to trap the bats (chiropterans), these devices were constructed in open spaces between trees after adapting with procedures of Jayaraj et al. [2]. In consideration, the trees should have ten meter distances, a vital criteria to construct the 50 \u00d7 50 (2500 m2) transect. Entanglement and capture of bats were carried out hourly every day after sunset and before sunrise (between 1830 and 0630). All bats were measured for size and weight using Vernier caliper and portable analytical balance (sensitivity \u00b1 0.01 kg). Specific measurements of bats such as ear, head-body, tail, forearm, tarsus and hind foot were used to distinguish the bat identity. Descriptive measurements of bats such as forearm length and weight were used to construct the Body Condition Index adopted from Suba et al. [3]. In the presence of negative values, the body mass scale was adapted with the values and separated by 0.5 differential margins that give rise to underweight, ideal, overweight and obese. Bat identity were associated with services, dwelling locations, possible pathogen associations, guilds and roosts, climb limits and range [4], [5]. All chiropteran were released at the site of capture after data acquisition. Recapture was prevented by excluding bats with same gender and size that have hair shavings on their hind foot. The data was interpret into diversity values of Shannon, Simpson, Evenness, Menhinick and Margalef using Paleontological Statistics Software Package (PAST) v.3 because these constructs accurately profile bats by abundance, diversity and richness at each site."}
