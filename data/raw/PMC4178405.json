{"title": "Novel Circovirus from Mink, China", "body": "During September\u2013October 2013, we collected liver, digestive tract (gut), and fecal samples from 43 mink (26 with diarrhea and 17 healthy) \u22486\u201310 months of age from 3 mink farms in Dalian, China. Using PCR-based methods, we excluded the following as causative agent: mink enteritis virus, canine distemper virus, Aleutian mink disease virus, mink orthoreovirus, and mink coronavirus. To identify the causative agent, we separately homogenized fecal, liver, and gut samples from diseased unvaccinated mink in phosphate-buffered saline and then submitted the supernatants to negative staining and observation under an electron microscope. We found circovirus-like particles, but not in typical lattice arrangement, in liver and gut samples. We performed PCRs with degenerate primers (CV-F1, CV-R1, CV-F2, and CV-R2; Table 1) based on highly conserved amino acid motifs in the Rep proteins of circoviruses and cycloviruses. Products of \u2248400 bp were purified and sequenced by using primer CV-R2. \n\nAll samples from mink with diarrhea were positive by PCR for the same circovirus-like Rep sequence; all samples from healthy mink were negative (Table 2), showing a strong relationship between the identified virus and disease. A BLAST search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi) showed the sequence to be an authentic circovirus sequence, with closest similarity (73%) to the bat circavirus (BtCV) from the Rhinolophus ferrumequinum group XO bat (XOR) genome, recently identified in bats by metagenomic analysis of tissue samples (10).\n\nTo obtain the complete genome sequence of MiCV, we used primers CV-F3, CV-R3, CV-F4, and CV-R4 (Table 1) for inverse PCR, together with Premix PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Inc., Dalian, China). The product was sequenced in duplicate. The complete circular genome of MiCV-DL13 contained 1,753 nt (GenBank accession no. KJ020099); highest similarity was 64.1% with the genome of BtCV-XOR. The putative Rep protein of MiCV-DL13 was 297 aa, and it shared 50.7%, 51.6%, 55.4%, and 79.7% aa identity with the Rep protein of pig (PCV2 AUT1, AY424401), bird (GoCV, AJ304456), dog (DogCV-1698, NC_020904) (2), and bat (BtCV-XOR, JX863737), respectively, circoviruses. The results of phylogenetic analyses based on the amino acid sequence of the Rep protein are shown in the Figure. The deduced capsid protein is 227 aa; highest similarity is 47.3% with porcine circovirus 2 (EU-RO-WB2006\u201338, JN382157) from wild boars in Romania (12). \n\nThe International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses has suggested criteria for circovirus species demarcation: genome nucleotide identities of <75% and capsid protein amino acid identities of <70% (1). The MiCV reported here therefore represents a new circovirus species.\n\nApart from the well-documented pathogenicity of porcine circovirus in pigs, of dog circovirus in dogs, and of other circoviruses in birds, the biological significance of widespread cyclovirus, circovirus, and circovirus-like virus infections in other domesticated and wild animals remains unknown. In this study, the novel circovirus, MiCV, was identified in liver and digestive tract samples from mink with diarrhea. No MiCV DNA was found in any healthy mink, thereby indicating a strong relationship between the isolated virus and disease. Whether other mustelids (e.g., weasels, badgers, and ferrets) or even humans in close contact with infected mink are susceptible to this virus merits further study."}
