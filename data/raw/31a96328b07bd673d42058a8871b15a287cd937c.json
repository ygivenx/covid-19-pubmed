{"title": "Detection of porcine rotavirus in stools by a latex agglutination test", "body": "Rotavirus (Saif et al., 1980; Bohl et al., 1982; Bridger et al., 1982 ) , porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus (Sasahara et al., 1958) and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PE) virus (Takahashi et al., 1983 ) are very important causative agents of viral gastroenteritis in pigs. Although many rotaviruses are present in the stools of pigs infected with rotavirus, there is no simple method for the detection of the virus. Although electron microscopy (Bishop, 1974) and the tissue culture method (Fukusho et al., 1981 ) can detect rotavirus, these methods are very complicated and need a lot of equipment. In the case of human rotavirus, many methods have been developed for the direct detection of the virus in stools by immunoassay, such as enzyme immunoassay (Sarrkinenn, 1981) , radioimmunoassay (Kalika et al., 1977) , reverse passive hemagglutination (RPHA) (Sanekata et al., 1979) and latex agglutination (LA; Sanekata et al., 1981 ) . In this paper, we report the development of a new LA test for the rapid diagnosis of porcine rotavirus infections. (Theil, 1977) , Wa, NCDV, and SAll strains were used to represent porcine, human, call, and simian rotaviruses respectively. Thesc viruses were prepared in MA-104 cells and purified as described previously (Sanekata, 1981 ) . This procedure involved rate zonal centrifugation using sucrose and metrizamidc. The resulting virus-containing bands were further purified b~ flotation in a metrizamide gradient at an ultracentritugation speed of 36 000 rpm t'or 16 ta. The high purity of the virus fraction was confirmed b\\ electron microscopy.\n\nAnti-OSU, anti-Wa, anti-NCDV and anti-SA 11 sera were prepared as previously described (Sanekata, 1981 ) . Anti-OSU IgG fraction ( anti-OSU IgG ) for the preparation of latex particles coated with antibody was purified with 33% saturated ammonium sulfate\n\nLA-antiOSU was prepared as described previously (Sanekata, 1981 ) . Latex particles (diameter 236 rim, Dow Chemical Company, USA ) were washed with 0.07 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 4 min at 4\u00b0C in a Hitachi SRTISAA rotor, and then suspended in PBS at a concentration of 1.0% (w/w). An equal volume of anti-OSU ( 1.0 mg/ml) was added to the latex suspension and the mixture was shaken at room temperature for 2 h. To eliminate unconjugated antibodies, the mixture was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 rain at 4 ~ C. and the supernatant was discarded. After washing the pellet three times with PBS by centrifugation, the LA-antiOSU was suspended at 0.7% in PBS and kept at 4:('.\n\nA 10% stool suspension in PBS was homogenized for 1 min using a Teflon tissue grinder. The homogenate was centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 5 rain at 4 C and the supernatant was subjected to the LA test. Ten/zl of the stool specimen was mixed with an equal volume of PBS on a glass slide. For the inhibition test, i0 ,ul of the same stool specimen was preincubated with 10 ltl of anti-OSU (immune adherence hemagglutination titer (IAHA: 1 : 160 ) for 6 rain at room temperature. Then 20/tl of LA-antiOSU was added to each specimen. After shaking for 2 min, the agglutination patterns were examined macroscopically. Specimens developing agglutination in the LA test but not in the inhibition test were regarded as positive.\n\nThe IAHA test was carried out according to Sanekata et al. ( 1982 ) . To each well of serial twofold dilutions of the sera on a U-shaped microtitration plate was added 4 units of virus in 25/21, and the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Then 25/~1 of complement was added, and the culture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 40 min. Dithiothreitol (DTT; 3 mg/ml) and human erythrocytes were then added.\n\nThe examination of virus by electron microscopy was carried out as described previously (Sanekata, 1983 ) . Briefly, a 10% stool suspension in double-distilled water (ddw) was mixed with an equal volume of trifluoroethane, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was layered on a 20% sucrose solution, then centrifuged at 40 000 rpm for 2 h. The pellet was suspended in 0.2 ml of ddw, stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and examined with a JEOL JEM-100CX electron microscope.\n\nThe reactivities of OSU, Wa, NCDV and SA11 with anti-OSU, anti-Wa, anti-NCDV and anti-SA11 were examined by IAHA (Table 1 ) . All four antisera showed cross-reaction with heterologous viruses, but the reactions were not as strong as with homologous viruses. OSU reacted strongly with anti-OSU and anti-SA 11. LA-antiOSU caused agglutination with OSU within 2 min on a glass slide. To confirm that the agglutination of LA-antiOSU was really due to a specific reaction between OSU and LA-antiOSU, the agglutinated specimens were examined under the electron microscope. Rosette tbrmation and bridge formation of the viruses on and between the LA-antiOSU particles were observed (Fig. I) . Agglutination of LA-antiOSU with OSU was completely inhibited by preincubation of OSU with anti-OSU at room temperature for 6 rain (Fig.  2) . Fig. 1 . Agglutination of latex particles coated with anti-OSU IgG (LA-antiOSU) with OSU ( \u00d7 72 000). LA-antiOSU was mixed with OSU for 2 rain at room temperature: the mixlurc was stained with 3% uranyl acetate and then observed under the electron microscope. Fig. 2 . Specific agglutination of LA-antiOSU with OSU. 1. OSU was mixed with LA-antiOStl for 2 rain. 2. OSU was preincubated with anti-OSU at room temperature for 6 rain and mixed with LA-antiOSU for 2 rain.\n\nThe sensitivities of the LA and electron microscope methods were estimated and compared (Table 2 ). An OSU suspension was used as an indicator. The highest dilutions of the virus detected as positive by the LA and electron microscope methods were 1:1024 and 1:256, respectively. To test whether the LA method detects OSU in stool extract with the same sensitivity as OSU diluted in PBS, as described above, OSU was diluted in PBS and in a 10% extract of normal stools of pigs. The LA method detected OSU in the stool extract with the same sensitivity as in PBS.\n\nSamples of LA-antiOSU were kept at 4 \u00b0 C for 6 months and their reactivity was examined monthly. No reduction in sensitivity and no tendency to develop nonspecific agglutination were observed during a period of 6 months.\n\nStool samples were prepared from pigs with diarrhea. Detection of rotavirus by the LA test was carried out and compared with the results of electron microscopy (Table 3 ). All stool samples in which rotavirus was detected by electron microscopy showed a strong positive agglutination, while the other samples were negative. But one of the four samples negative by electron mi- specimens, such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, radioimmunoassay and electron microscopy. However, these methods seem to be inappropriate t`or routine diagnosis. Electron microscopy is complicated and needs expert technicians. Radioimmunoassay requires radioisotopes. The tissue culture method employing MA-104 cells takes a considerable time to perform. Enzyme immunoassay is not economical t'or testing a small number of samples. The agglutination method is thought to be useful, however, since it is rapid, simple and sensitive enough to be employed as a routine test (Sanekata et al., 1979 (Sanekata et al., , 198 I. 1990 ). In this study, we developed the LA test for the detection of porcine rotavirus directly from stools, and compared the sensitivity of the LA test with that of the electron microscope test.\n\nMany kits for the detection of human rotavirus using immunological methods are commercially available. These kits are prepared using anti-human rotavirus, anti-simian rotavirus or anti-calf rotavirus. Since these viruses difl'er from porcine rotavirus in antigenicity, the anti-Wa or anti-NCDV antisera did not cross-react with porcine rotavirus-like homologous antibodies (Table  1 ). Hence we consider that these antibodies are not suitable l'or the detection of porcine rotavirus. A kit for the detection of human rotavirus using anti-NCDV antibody could in fact detect only 12 of 17 rotavirus-positive samples, while LA-antiOSU could detect all of these porcine rotaviruses.\n\nSince binding of rotavirus with kA-antiOSU occurred within 2 min on a glass slide, an LA test result can be obtained within 8 min, including the inhibition test. Especially in the case of liquid samples, rotavirus could be detected directly: 10 Ill of liquid stool was layered on a glass slide, and an equal volume of PBS was added and mixed gently using a stick. Then 20 ILl of LA-antiOSU was added and mixed for 2 min until complete agglutination occurred.\n\nAlthough the number of stool samples examined was small, LA-antiOSU could specifically detect porcine rotavirus in pig stools. This LA-antiOSU did not react with stools containing coronavirus or enterovirus-like particles. The LA method was thus found to be useful and practical for the detection of porcine rotavirus in stools. It is rapid and simple, and is sensitive enough for diagnostic and epidemiological investigation."}
