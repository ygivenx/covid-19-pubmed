{"title": "The 10th Anniversary of Asia Pacific Allergy\n", "body": "Best wishes for a Happy New Year!\n\nIt is great pleasure to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Asia Pacific Allergy, the official journal of Asia Pacific Association of Allergy, Asthma, and Clinical Immunology (APAAACI)!\n\nThis year Asia Pacific Allergy will have new collaborations: position papers, review papers, original articles from the various committees of APAAACI. In this issue, readers will find very nice review articles: APAAACI white paper 2020 on climate change, air pollution, and biodiversity, and a review article on drug hypersensitivity reactions that highlight important regional issues and challenges [1, 2]. With industrialization, air pollutants are present everywhere \u2013 outdoors and indoors which affect allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. Outdoor air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, CO, NO2, ozone, particulate matter (PM), and diesel exhaust come from many sources. Natural sources include wildfires, volcanoes, biologic decay, and dust storms. Man-made air pollutants from motor vehicles, biomass burning, power plants, manufacturing facilities, and waste incineration are of more concern. Especially PM with a diameter of 10 \u03bcm or less (PM10), PM with a diameter of 2.5 \u03bcm or less (PM2.5) and even PM with a diameter of 0.1 \u03bcm or less (ultrafine particles) have been dramatically increasing in our region, and causing major health problems. Indoor air pollutants include volatile organic compound, PM, and combustion pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, CO, and NO2. Indoor air pollutants come from various sources: environmental tobacco smoke, furniture, combustion products such as stoves and gas ranges, building materials, and biological agents from mold and animals. Readers will enjoy the overview of important issues in climate change, air pollution, biodiversity, and allergic diseases.\n\nDrug hypersensitivity reactions are also major health problems causing morbidity and even mortality both in adults and children. In this issue, Thong et al. [2] highlight important regional issues and challenges focusing on 5 aspects of drug hypersensitivity reactions: beta-lactam allergy, severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions, antituberculosis drug allergy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug hypersensitivity reactions, and radiocontrast media hypersensitivity. Readers will find important discoveries and issues in drug hypersensitivity reactions from our region through this nice overview from the drug allergy committee of APAAACI. This issue also contains a very interesting case report suggesting altered T cell and monocyte subsets in prolonged immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome related with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [3].\n\nAsthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of airway that can be exacerbated by various triggering factors. Which tests can predict the loss of asthma control? In this issue, Kreetapirom et al. [4] and Kang et al. [5] shares their experience with forced oscillator technique, a noninvasive objective measurement of lung physiology, and spirometric parameters such as forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity with fractional exhaled nitric oxide.\n\nFruit allergy is an interesting area. Most patients have oral allergy syndrome. However, some patients have very severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis. This issue contains interesting articles on banana-induced anaphylaxis from Thailand [6], and the association between fruit and vegetable allergies and pollen-food allergy in Japanese children [7]. This issue also contains unique articles on 5-year experience of peanut allergy in the largest pediatric hospital in Singapore [8] and differences in omega-5-gliadin allergy, wheat dependent exercise induced anaphylaxis, from Hong Kong and UK [9].\n\nProper diagnosis and management of anaphylaxis is very critical in the Emergency Department. De Vera and Tagaro [10] emphasize the importance again in the article from the Philippines. Educations not only for patients and their care givers, but also for medical students, physicians, nurses, nurseries, kindergartens, schools, and emergency rescue teams are very important to increase the awareness on anaphylaxis [11121314].\n\nIn this January, there has been lots of difficulties such as Taal volcano eruption in the Philippines (I was in Silang near Taal with medical students for a medical volunteer program at the time of eruption), and 2019-nCoV, a novel corona virus, outbreak. As the Editor-in-Chief, I deeply appreciate those who contributed for this issue in times of difficulty. Our mission is to publish your work, and to introduce you and your work to the world.\n\nPlease note that Japanese Society of Allergology/ World Allergy Organization Joint Congress (WAC 2020) conjoint with the APAAACI/APAPARI 2020 Congress will be held in Kyoto on September 17\u201320 this year. It is also the official APAAACI congress. Hope many of you can join us. Please save the dates!"}
