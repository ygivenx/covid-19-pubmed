{"title": "A CRISPR screen identifies IFI6 as an ER-resident interferon effector that blocks flavivirus replication HHS Public Access Author manuscript", "body": "Viruses in the Flavivirus genus cause significant human disease. Innate immune control of these viruses is mediated by IFNs 3 , which induce transcription of hundreds of ISGs, some of which encode antiviral effector proteins 4 . To identify genes regulating the IFN response to a flavivirus, we used a genome-scale CRISPR approach to screen for single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that rendered cells permissive to infection with yellow fever virus expressing Venus (YFV-Venus) despite treatment with a highly suppressive dose of IFN\u03b1 (Fig 1a) .\n\nMultiple hits from the screen reconstituted the IFN signaling pathway, as expected, or were factors involved in mRNA processing (Fig 1b, c, Supplementary Table 1 ). Comparing hits to our annotated list of 448 human ISGs revealed only three overlapping genes: IFI6, and two IFN signaling ISGs, STAT2, and IRF9 (Fig 1d) 4 . Aside from IFI6, which was among the most significant hits (P = 2.7 \u00d7 10 \u221213 ), no other classical ISGs were found with this analysis (Fig 1d) .\n\nTo confirm this result, we used two strategies to deplete IFI6 via CRISPR. In the first, we used a puromycin-selectable lentiCRISPRv2 vector to deliver one sgRNA targeting IFI6 (IFI6-KO 1 ). In the second, we used both puromycin-selectable and blasticidin-selectable lentiCRISPRv2 vectors to co-deliver two distinct IFI6-targeted sgRNAs (IFI6-KO 2 ) that were also different from the sgRNA in the IFI6-KO 1 strategy. We generated an IFI6 knockout line, Huh7.5-IFI6-KO 1 , and showed loss of IFN-induced IFI6 expression by western blot (Fig 1e and Supplementary Fig 1a) . In infection studies, compared to control Huh7.5 cells, Huh7.5-IFI6-KO 1 cells were markedly refractory to an otherwise robust IFNmediated inhibition of West Nile virus expressing (WNV-GFP) (Fig 1f) and YFV-Venus ( Supplementary Fig 1b) . Similar results with YFV-Venus were obtained in two other cell backgrounds, A549-IFI6-KO 1 and U-2 OS IFI6-KO 1 , and in Huh7.5-IFI6-KO 2 cells ( Supplementary Fig 1c,d,e) . To determine the effects of IFN-inducible IFI6 on a nonattenuated, non-reporter flavivirus, we assessed WNV titers in Huh7.5-NT (control cells expressing a non-targeting sgRNA) or in Huh7.5-IFI6-KO 2 cells with or without IFN pretreatment (Fig 1g) . In the absence of IFN, WNV replicated to similar titers in Huh7.5-NT and Huh7.5-IFI6-KO 2 cells. IFN suppressed WNV replication by approximately 3 logs in Huh7.5-NT cells at 24 h and 48 h. At 72 h, the inhibitory effect was diminished, and this correlated with decreased IFI6 expression by western blot. Notably, WNV titers were nearly completely restored at all time points in IFN-treated Huh7.5-IFI6-KO 2 cells. To complement these IFI6 depletion studies, we also demonstrated that ectopically expressed IFI6 potently suppressed YFV-Venus in multiple cells types (Supplementary Fig 1f) . Time courses revealed potent and sustained IFI6-mediated inhibition of YFV-Venus and dengue virus expressing GFP (DENV-GFP) (Fig 1h,i) , as well as 2-3 log 10 suppression of non-reporter YFV titers (Fig 1j) . Contemporary and prototype strains of Zika virus were also inhibited by IFI6 (Fig 1k and Supplementary Fig 1g) , though to a lesser extent than the other flaviviruses we tested. These data establish a robust inhibitory phenotype for IFI6 against flaviviruses. In previous ectopic expression or shRNA knockdown screens, we and others also found IFI6 as inhibitory toward flaviviruses, further strengthening the reproducibility of the phenotype through multiple screening approaches [4] [5] [6] [7] .\n\nWe next assessed the antiviral potential of IFI6 in more biologically relevant primary human cells. Ectopic expression of IFI6 suppressed ZIKV production in human fetal neural progenitors (Fig 1l) . IFI6 was robustly induced in both IFN-treated (Fig 1m, n) and in DENV-infected (Fig 1o) primary normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). Despite poor replication of DENV in NHDF, we observed enhanced DENV titers in CRIPSR-targeted NHDF-IFI6-KO 1 cells relative to control cells (Fig 1p) . Similarly, when comparing WNV replication in NHDF-IFI6-KO 2 cells relative to control NHDF-NT cells, we found that titers were 11-fold or 18-fold higher at 48 h or 72 h post-infection, respectively (Fig 1q) . Together, these data indicate that IFI6 is necessary for a robust anti-flavivirus IFN response, is sufficient to prophylactically suppress infection, and can inhibit flavivirus replication in primary human cells.\n\nIFI6 encodes a small, 130 amino acid protein in the IFI-6-16 family, which has four conserved paralogs in humans (IFI6, IFI27, IFI27L1, and IFI27L2) and three in mice (Ifi27, Ifi27l2a, Ifi27l2b) ( Supplementary Fig 2a) 8 . IFI6 is only present in higher order mammals. In humans, only IFI6 and IFI27 are IFN-inducible ( Supplementary Fig 2b) 2, 9 . However, IFI27 did not inhibit YFV infection ( Supplementary Fig 2c) , suggesting distinct functions for these related proteins.\n\nSince IFI6 overexpression suppressed infection similar to IFN\u03b1 (compare Fig 1f and Fig  1h) , we tested whether IFI6 modulates cellular antiviral gene expression. In contrast to the antiviral transcription factor IRF1, ectopically expressed IFI6 did not induce classical ISGs IFIT1, IFITM3, OAS2, and RSAD2, or significantly alter the global cellular transcriptome ( Supplementary Fig 3a, b) . Furthermore, Huh7.5-IFI6-KO 1 cells treated with IFN\u03b1 were not impaired in their ability to induce other ISGs (Supplementary Fig 3c) . These data indicate that IFI6 does not mediate antiviral signaling and is likely a direct effector.\n\nAnother screening hit, HSPA5, encodes BiP/GRP78, an HSP70 chaperone in the ER that assists in protein folding and surveillance of misfolded proteins 10 . We hypothesized that BiP may modulate the antiviral effects of IFI6. We first assessed IFI6 and BiP mRNA and protein levels in IFN-treated cells (Fig 2a) . As expected, IFI6 mRNA and protein were highly induced over a time course of IFN treatment. BiP mRNA levels were largely unaffected by IFN, while BiP protein increased slightly at each time point after IFN treatment. To validate the CRISPR screen, we depleted BiP via CRISPR and found that YFV infection was de-repressed by more than 5-fold in the presence of IFN\u03b1 (Fig 2b) . In the absence of IFN\u03b1, we detected a modest 1.5-fold loss of infection in BiP-depleted cells, suggesting a minor role for this chaperone during YFV infection. We then knocked out BiP in cells ectopically expressing IFI6 and observed a similar (~ 4-fold) de-repression of YFV infection as with IFN\u03b1 treatment (Fig 2c) . The antiviral activity of IFN\u03b1 could be restored in BiP-depleted cells by complementing cells with sgRNA-resistant BiP (Fig 2d) . Notably, depletion of BiP resulted in near complete loss of ectopic IFI6 expression (Fig 2e) . These data suggest that in the absence of BiP, IFI6 is targeted for degradation. This was confirmed by restoring IFI6 expression in BiP-depleted cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig 2f) . To test whether BiP chaperone activity was required for its regulation of IFI6, we reconstituted BiP-depleted cells with CRISPR-resistant wild-type BiP, or three ATPasedefective mutants 11 . The mutants could not rescue IFI6 levels (Fig 2g) , suggesting that BiP chaperone activity is required for IFI6 protein expression. To assess potential interactions between BiP and IFI6, we immunoprecipitated ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged IFI6 and found that BiP was indeed pulled down (Fig 2h) . The interaction was abrogated by ATP, which binds the chaperone and induces a conformational change that releases substrates 12 . We next tested whether endogenous, IFN-induced IFI6 interacts with BiP. Since our IFI6 antibody has high background ( Supplementary Fig 1a) , we used CRISPR-Cas9-mediated \"gene tagging\" to introduce a 3xFLAG epitope at the C terminus of endogenous IFI6 in U-2 OS cells 13 . RT-PCR and western blotting confirmed IFN\u03b1-mediated induction of endogenous FLAG-tagged IFI6 (Fig 2i) . In a proximity ligation assay, we detected a robust interaction signal for BiP and IFI6 in IFN-treated gene tagged cells (Fig 2j and  Supplementary Fig 4a) . Thus, BiP likely functions as a regulator of the IFN response to flaviviruses by facilitating proper folding and/or localization of IFI6 at the ER membrane.\n\nThe functional link between IFI6 and BiP, a lumenal ER chaperone, was unexpected since several reports indicate IFI6 is a mitochondrial protein [14] [15] [16] . We therefore sought to resolve IFI6 subcellular localization. The N terminus of IFI6 has a predicted signal peptide ( Supplementary Fig 4b) , suggesting targeting to the secretory pathway (ER, Golgi, endosomes, etc.). Indeed, expression of IFI6 bearing a C terminal 3x FLAG epitope (IFI6-3xF) revealed a reticular staining pattern that overlapped with ER translocon member Sec61\u03b2-GFP, but was distinct from mitochondria-localized GFP (Fig 3a) . Since overexpression can mislocalize proteins, we assessed the localization of endogenous IFI6 in our gene-tagged cells (Fig 2i) . Immunofluorescence of IFN-treated, gene-tagged cells demonstrated a reticular pattern for endogenous IFI6 that overlapped with Sec61\u03b2-GFP ( Fig  3b) and was similar to ectopically expressed IFI6-3xF (Fig 3a) . Immunogold electron microscopy in COS-7 cells revealed that ectopically expressed IFI6 bearing a C terminal HA tag (IFI6-HA) localized extensively to cytosolic membranes resembling ER structures, but not within nuclei or mitochondria (Fig 3c) . We confirmed by immunofluorescence that IFI6-HA staining in COS-7 cells was reticular and distinct from a mitochondrial GFP signal ( Fig  3d) . Lastly, we fused the putative N terminal signal peptide of IFI6 to GFP and found that the signal from this fusion protein, (N32)IFI6-GFP, overlapped with the common ER epitope KDEL (Fig 3e) . Together, these results suggest that, contrary to previous reports, IFI6 is localized to the ER, the site of flavivirus replication.\n\nIFI6 is highly hydrophobic and has putative transmembrane helices ( Supplementary Fig 4c,  d) , suggesting it may be membrane associated. To test this, we monitored IFI6-3xF migration in a membrane flotation assay 17, 18 . IFI6-3xF migrated to similar fractions as the ER integral membrane protein calnexin (Fig 3f) . Solubilization of membranes with Triton X-100 shifted the entire pool of IFI6 and calnexin to higher densities. By contrast, disrupting electrostatic interactions with a high salt concentration did not affect the migration pattern. Treatment with sodium carbonate pH 11.5, which disrupts peripheral membrane protein association 19 , caused a small proportion of IFI6 to shift to higher densities, although most signal was retained at lower density. Similar results were obtained with a different gradient composition (Supplementary Fig 4e) . These data suggest IFI6 is primarily an integral membrane protein, though we cannot rule out that some of the protein may associate to membranes through peripheral interactions. Supporting this conclusion, we did not detect secretion of IFI6 from cells, whereas secretion of CCL2, a control, was robust and readily blocked by Brefeldin A treatment (Fig 3g) .\n\nTo gain insight into the mechanism of action of IFI6, we assessed which viral replication step was targeted. We first used a reporter DENV expressing Phytonus pyralis firefly luciferase (Fluc) 7 . This virus recapitulates the full replication cycle, with Fluc expressed at low levels during post-entry primary viral RNA translation and at higher levels during genome amplification. IFI6 suppressed DENV-Fluc at late, but not early time points, suggesting viral entry and primary RNA translation were likely intact, while viral genome replication was inhibited (Fig 4a) . Similar results were obtained with a YFV sub-genomic replicon expressing Renilla reniformis luciferase (Rluc) (Supplementary Fig 5a) , which uncouples viral RNA translation and replication from entry and virion morphogenesis 20 .\n\nAfter viral RNA translation, the flavivirus polyprotein is cleaved by both the viral protease, NS3, and host signal peptidases to initiate replication. We tested whether IFI6 affected cleavage of DENV proteins or a known host target, STING 21 . IFI6 had no effect on the ability of DENV NS2B-NS3 to cleave itself or STING (Supplementary Fig 6a) . Similarly, ectopically expressed DENV C-prM and 2K-NS4B, which are both processed in a SPCS1dependent manner 22 , were properly cleaved in the presence and absence of IFI6 ( Supplementary Fig 6b,c) . Together, these data suggest that IFI6 does not interfere with polyprotein processing events mediated by the viral protease or SPCS1.\n\nAfter polyprotein processing, flavivirus infection is characterized by dramatic rearrangement of ER membranes, including the formation of single-membrane invaginations that house the replication machinery 1 . Using transmission electron microscopy, we found that IFI6 expression markedly suppressed the formation of these \"replication organelles\" (Fig 4b) .\n\nThis correlated with near complete suppression of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) replication intermediates (Fig 4c) . We attempted to overcome IFI6-mediated inhibition by rescuing a serially passaged YFV mutant. However, after passaging YFV 20 times in IFI6expressing cells, we were unable to rescue an escape variant ( Supplementary Fig 7) , indicating that the IFI6-mediated replication block is not easily overcome by mutation. Together, these replication cycle studies suggest that IFI6 specifically targets an early step in the process of genome amplification, after viral entry, translation, and polyprotein processing.\n\nTwo models may explain how IFI6 inhibits flavivirus replication: Model 1) IFI6 inhibits the viral polymerase or viral RNA amplification, thereby preventing the production of viral proteins that induce replication organelle formation, or model 2) IFI6 has no impact on replication per se, but rather interferes with the ability of the viral proteins to invaginate the ER membrane, which is required for robust replication. To distinguish these two possibilities, we performed a time-of-addition experiment in which IFI6 was expressed either before or after infection. We found that expressing IFI6 at the same time as or after viral infection rendered IFI6 incapable of inhibiting replication, as shown by infectivity assays and viral NS1 protein expression (Fig 4 d,e) . Thus, despite being expressed in virally infected cells, IFI6 cannot inhibit viral replication once it is already established. This \"pointof-no-return\" phenotype indicates that IFI6 is primarily a prophylactic antiviral effector, and suggests that it may target virus-induced membrane alterations at the ER (model 2) rather than viral genome amplification (model 1). In support of this conclusion, when we infected IFI6-expressing cells at a high enough MOI of DENV to partially overcome the antiviral effect, we observed that IFI6 colocalized with ER-resident DENV NS4B (Fig 4f, g , and Supplementary Fig 8) . We also found that in some cells, IFI6 re-localized to NS4B-rich large cytoplasmic punctae, which are characteristic of DENV infection (Fig 4f) 17 . Since NS4B helps form the membrane scaffold required for replication organelle biogenesis 23-25 , we propose that IFI6, if expressed before infection, suppresses flavivirus replication by thwarting virus-induced ER perturbations.\n\nOur model also predicts that IFI6 would not target RNA viruses that do not replicate on ER membranes. Indeed, ectopic expression of IFI6 did not inhibit other diverse RNA viruses, including Sindbis virus (Togaviridae family), coxsackie B virus (Picornaviridae family), or measles virus (Paramyxoviridae family) ( Supplementary Fig 5b) . Loss of IFI6 did not affect IFN-mediated inhibition of SINV or CVB infection ( Supplementary Fig 5c) . We next tested the inhibitory potential of IFI6 against hepatitis C virus (HCV), which like DENV or YFV, is a Flaviviridae family member (genus Hepacivirus). Using multiple HCV constructs in both gain-and loss-of-function assays, we found that IFI6 lacked inhibitory activity against HCV (Fig 4h, i, j and Supplementary Fig 5d) . This was unexpected since HCV also replicates at the ER. However, rather than induce single-membrane invaginations like the flaviviruses, HCV infection results in the formation of double-membrane vesicles that protrude out from the ER 1 . To determine whether HCV subverts the antiviral effects of IFI6, which was proposed recently 26 , we co-infected cells with both YFV and HCV reporter viruses, predicting that IFI6 may have reduced activity against YFV if HCV counteracts its function. However, IFI6 still inhibited YFV, but not HCV (Fig 4k) , suggesting that HCV does not antagonize IFI6 in a manner that interferes with its anti-flavivirus activity ( Supplementary Fig 5e) . Other groups have reported that ectopically expressed IFI6 inhibits HCV 27, 28 , but the magnitude of inhibition in those studies was typically on the order of 2fold, rather than the multiple log-fold inhibition we observe with flaviviruses. Moreover, supporting our data, three independent loss-of-function screens to identify genes mediating the IFN response to HCV failed to identify IFI6 as a hit [29] [30] [31] . Beyond HCV, we also found that IFI6 does not inhibit a coronavirus (Fig 4l) , which like HCV, forms double-membrane vesicles at the ER 32 . Together, these data support a model in which IFI6 inhibits ER membrane perturbations specific to flaviviruses, but not to other viruses that generate different ER structures (Fig 4m) .\n\nOur study reveals IFI6 to be an ER integral membrane protein and key IFN-inducible antiviral effector. The unique viral specificity of IFI6 suggests a mechanism that may be tailored for flavivirus-induced single-membrane invaginations at the ER, but not the ERderived double-membrane vesicles formed during replication of HCV and coronavirus. If the host has evolved multiple mechanisms to inhibit membrane-derived viral replication compartments, then future studies may reveal IFI6-like molecules that target other viruses replicating at the ER or distinct membranous organelles. Our findings further raise the intriguing possibility that this antiviral strategy may be leveraged for therapeutic intervention of flavivirus infection.\n\nHuh7.5, U-2 OS, A549, 293T (from C. Rice), 293 (from N. Conrad), and COS-7 (from N. Alto) and all derivatives were maintained in \"complete\" DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1x NEAA (Gibco). Human STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts (from J-L.\n\nCasanova) were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1x NEAA (Gibco). BHK21-J (from C. Rice) were grown in MEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1x NEAA. Stable cells expressing antibiotic resistance genes were grown in complete media supplemented with puromycin (Sigma) at 4\u03bcg/mL or blasticidin (Gibco) at 15 \u03bcg/mL. Normal human dermal fibroblasts were purchased from Lonza and cultured in fibroblast basal media (ATCC or Lonza) as recommended by the supplier. Human fetal neural progenitors were cultured as previously described 33 . Cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma using a PCR based assay (Vendor GeM Mycoplasma Detection Kit from Sigma Cat.#MP0025-1KT). When applicable, cell lines were authenticated with STR analysis using the ATCC Cell Line Authentication service.\n\nGeneration and propagation of the following viruses or replicons have been previously 33 . Infectious HCV-Gluc was generated from the infectious clone Jc1FLAG(p7-nsGluc2A) as previously described 34 . An infectious clone of non-reporter WNV (strain TX02) was kindly provided by I. Frolov and virus was propagated as described above for WNV-GFP. DENV-Fluc with a L52F mutation in NS4B was derived from the pDENV2-IC30P-A and propagated as previously described 7 . A ZIKV MR766-GFP infectious clone (kindly provided by M. Evans) was used to generate virus as described 35 . The infectious clone, pACNR-FLYF-17Dx (kindly provided by C. Rice) was used to generate non-reporter YFV-17D. Briefly, the plasmid was linearized with XhoI, and the purified DNA was used as a template for transcription with the mMessage mMachine SP6 Transcription kit (ThermoFisher). RNA was purified with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and electroporated into BHK21-J cells. Virus-containing supernatants were collected, clarified by centrifugation, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. Human coronavirus OC43 (ATCC strain VR-1558) was propagated in HCT-8 cells as specified by the ATCC. Viral titers were determined by antibody staining (Millipore MAB9012) and flow cytometry 36 .\n\nTo generate a C-terminal 3xFLAG-tagged IFI6 variant, pENTR221.IFI6 from the ISG library previously described 4 was digested with PstI and XhoI (NEB). Full length IFI6 containing a glycine-serine linker was PCR amplified from pENTR221.IFI6. A 3xFLAG epitope was PCR amplified from pcDNA4/TO/GFP-3xFLAG (kindly provided by Ivan D'Orso). The three fragments were combined with the Gibson Assembly Cloning Kit (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer's instructions, to give the final pENTR221.IFI6-3xFLAG construct. A similar HA-tagged construct was generated by replacing the 3xFLAG epitope with annealed oligos encoding the HA epitope, to generate pENTR221.IFI6-HA.\n\nTo generate a GFP expressing the putative IFI6 signal peptide at its N terminus, full length EGFP was PCR amplified with primers containing SacI or XhoI sites and directionally cloned into a SacI/XhoI-digested pENTR221.IFI6 vector. The resulting plasmid was named pENTR221.IFI6(N32)-EGFP.\n\nTo generate CCL2 with a 1xFLAG tag on the C terminus, pENTR221.CCL2 from the ISG library previously described 4 was modified as follows. A DNA fragment containing a 1xFLAG coding sequence flanked by CCL2 homology arms was synthesized and inserted into the pENTR221.CCL2 with the Gibson Assembly Cloning Kit (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\nTo generate DENV-2K-NS4B-HA, the 2K-NS4B region from pDENV2-IC30P-A was PCRamplified and cloned into lentiviral expression plasmid, pTRIP.XKB-GFP (gift from C. Rice), replacing the GFP sequence. A similar construct expressing DENV C-prM was generated by PCR.\n\nThe Gateway-compatible lentiviral SCRPSY-DEST plasmid co-expressing TagRFP and a puromycin resistance cassette has been previously described 7 . A derivative of this plasmid in which TagRFP was replaced with a nuclear-localized TagBFP (Evrogen) was generated and named SCRPSY-DEST-nlsBFP. A second derivative of SCRPSY-DEST, named SCRBBL-DEST, was generated by removing the TagRFP-2A-Puro R cassette and subcloning a PCR amplified blasticidin resistance gene in its place. The previously described pTRIP.CMV.IVSB.ires.TagRFP-DEST vector 4 was modified to remove the ires-TagRFP cassette, generating a non-reporter Gateway-compatible lentiviral vector named pTRIP.CMV.IVSB-DEST. Lentiviral expression constructs were generated by combining ENTR and DEST vectors in recombination reaction using LR Clonase II (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. All pENTR constructs were propagated in DH5\u03b1 cells, while lentiviral vectors were grown in DH5\u03b1 or MDS42RecA cells (Scarab Genomics).\n\nTo complement cells that had genomic BiP edited by CRISPR, an overexpression construct of BiP containing 6 silent mutations in the region targeted by BiP CRISPR guide 3 was generated. A synthetic gene fragment of BiP containing silent mutations was cloned into pENTR221-BiP (kindly provided by N. Alto) after digestion with AflII and PmlI restriction enzymes, using Gibson Assembly Cloning Kit (New England Biolabs) according to manufacturer's instructions. Constructs expressing catalytic mutant versions of guide 3 CRISPR resistant BiP (T37G, E201G, and T229G) were generated using site-directed mutagenesis and verified by sequencing. Oligo sequences used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 2 .\n\nLentiviral production and transductions were performed as previously described 4 . Viral infections for GFP-expressing reporter viruses and for ZIKV were carried out as previously described 4, 5, 33 . For non-reporter YFV-17D growth curve, cells were infected with a MOI of 2 in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS for 1h. Media was aspirated and cells were washed with serum free DMEM four times and replaced with 500\u03bcL of complete DMEM. Virus yields in supernatants were quantified by plaque assay. Studies using HCV subgenomic replicon (Bi-Gluc-JFH[SG]) were carried out as previously described 4 . The YFV-17D subgenomic replicon YFRP-Rluc (kindly provided by Richard Kuhn), was propagated and used to generate viral RNA as previously described 20 . Assays to detect YFV-Rluc replicon activity were conducted similar to HCV replicon studies, with detection of intracellular Renilla luciferase using the Renilla Luciferase Assay System (Promega). \n\nOligos encoding sgRNAs for generating knockout cells using CRISPR-Cas9 were cloned into lentiCRISPRv2 plasmid (a gift from Feng Zhang, Addgene plasmid # 52961) as previously described 37, 38 . Oligo sequences for sgRNAs targeting IFI6, BiP, or non-targeting controls are listed in Supplementary Table 2. LentiCRISPRv2 clones containing guide sequences were sequenced, purified, and used for lentiviral production as described above. For generating heterogeneous knockout cell populations, Huh7.5, A549, or U-2 OS cells were infected with lentiCRISPRv2-derived lentivirus for 48 h, then reseeded into complete DMEM containing 1-4ug/mL puromycin for 3 days to select for transduced cells.\n\nSingle-cell clones of Huh7.5 cells targeted for IFI6 knockout via CRISPR could not be propagated. To overcome this limitation, CRISPR-targeted Huh7.5 cells (using sgRNA \"BR2\") were diluted with parental Huh7.5 cells at a ratio of 1:2000. Mixed cells were plated at 100 cells/well in 96 well plates. Once confluent, cells were passaged to a 48-well format in the presence of 4 \u03bcg/mL puromycin to kill off non-targeted cells. Surviving populations derived in this manner were propagated and expanded for 6 weeks before cryopreserving stock cultures. Using this strategy, an IFI6-targeted knockout cell line was generated and named \"IFI6-KO 1 \" . In another strategy, two distinct guides targeting IFI6 (\"g1g2\") were coexpressed, one by lentiCRISPRv2 (blasticidin-selectable) and the other by lentiCRISPRv2 (puromycin-selectable). Double drug selection led to bulk populations of cells, with each cell receiving two independent CRISPR guides targeting IFI6. These were named \"IFI6-KO 2 \" cells.\n\nThe following methods were used for cells targeted via the IFI6-KO 1 strategy. The day before IFN treatment and infection, 70,000-150,000 cells were plated onto 24-well plates. Cells were pre-treated with serial dilutions of IFN\u03b1 4 h before infection. The IFNcontaining media was removed and cells were incubated with 0.5-1.0 MOI virus (CVB-GFP, SINV-GFP, YFV-Venus, or WNV-GFP) for 1-2h before being brought to volume with complete DMEM. After approximately one viral life cycle, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. \n\nThe genome-wide CRISPR screen using the Brunello CRISPR knockout pooled library is described in detail in Supplementary Methods. Briefly, Huh7.5 cells were transduced with the Brunello CRISPR library. Puromycin-selected cell populations were treated with IFN\u03b1 overnight, followed by YFV-Venus infection for 24 h. Venus-positive cells that were no longer sensitive to IFN\u03b1-mediated inhibition were collected by FACS sorting. Genomic DNA was isolated from these cells, and sgRNA sequences were amplified by PCR and deep sequenced. Data were analyzed using the MAGeCK method. 39\n\nFor lentiviral transductions, NHDF were plated at approximately 100,000 cells per well onto 6-well plates. The next day, cells were transduced via spinoculation with lentiCRISPRv2 (expressing non-targeting sgRNAs or sgRNAs targeting IFI6) in 2mL of fibroblast basal media at 37\u00b0C for at 800 x g. Two days post transduction cells were pooled and placed under selection with 4\u03bcg/mL of puromycin and 15\u03bcg/ml blasticidin. Three days after selection cells, were plated for experiments or passaged once before plating for experiments. For DENV infections, 100,000 cells per well were plated onto 6-well plates. The next day cells were infected with DENV at an MOI of 2 for 2 hours in 1mL of fibroblast basal media. The supernatant was aspirated and cells were washed four times with 500\u03bcL of media and a 1.5mL media was added back. Forty-eight hours post infection, supernatants were collected and titered by limiting dilution on STAT1 \u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts as described above. Cell lysates were collected for western blot to detect IFI6 expression. For WNV infections, 40,000-80,000 cells per well were plated onto 6-well plates. The next day cells were infected with WNV at an MOI of 0.01 for 1 hour in 1mL of fibroblast basal media. The supernatant was aspirated and cells were washed four times with 500uL of media and a final volume of 1mL was placed on the cells. Supernatant was collected at 24, 48, and 72 h for titering by plaque assay on BHK cells. To detect IFI6 induction by IFN in NHDF, 100,000 cells per well were plated onto 6-well plates (for RNA isolation), or 200,000 cells were plated onto 6 cm dishes (for protein isolation). Cells were treated with IFN at indicated doses for 4 h or 24 h. Cells collected for RNA were processed using the Qiagen RNeasy protocol and IFI6 mRNA was detected RT-qPCR as described above. For protein detection cells were collected, resuspended in lysis buffer and mixed with 1x SDS loading buffer lacking BME. Samples were sonicated but not boiled, and loaded onto Tris-tricine low molecular weight gels and analyzed for IFI6 expression as described above.\n\nOligos encoding an sgRNA near the C terminal coding region of IFI6 were cloned into LentiCRISPRV2 as described above. An IFI6-based donor vector containing homology arms flanking the PAM site by 800bp in both directions and a 3xFLAG sequence was synthesized in a pUC57 backbone (Genewiz). The PAM site codons were altered to avoid re-targeting of the site once DNA repair had occurred. For transfections, 200,000 U2OS were seeded onto 6-well plates in complete DMEM containing 0.1\u03bcM SCR-7, a DNA ligase IV inhibitor (Tocris). The donor vector and LentiCRISPRv2 vector were transfected with X-tremeGENE 9 (Roche) into U-2 OS at a ratio of 2:1 with a final DNA amount of 2 \u03bcg per well. Two days post transfection cells were re-plated in complete DMEM with 1\u03bcg/mL puromycin and 0.1\u03bcM SCR-7 for 24h, then replaced with complete DMEM with 0.1\u03bcM SCR-7 and no puromycin. Cells were maintained for at least one week before use in experiments.\n\nCells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 minutes, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X 100 in PBS for 5 minutes, and blocked with 10% BSA, 5% goat serum and 50mM glycine in PBS for 30 minutes. Primary antibody incubation for 2h at room temperature was followed by secondary incubation with an AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibody (Life Technologies, AF-488 for green channels, AF-555 for red channels). Cells were mounted with ProLong Diamond with DAPI (Life Technologies) and imaged with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope or Zeiss Observer Z.1 microscope, unless otherwise indicated.\n\ndsRNA.-Approximately 20,000 Huh7.5 cells stably expressing IFI6 or an empty vector were plated into 8-well chamber slides. Cells were infected with 1.5 MOI YFV-17D for 1 h. Cells were incubated for 48 h, and following the protocol described above were stained with J2 dsRNA antibody (Scicons, 1:200) and Hoechst stain (ThermoFisher, 1:12,000) and mounted with ProLong Gold (Life Technologies).\n\nSec61\u03b2-mEmerald and pTRIP.mito-GFP.-mEmerald-Sec61-C-18 was a gift from Michael Davidson (Addgene plasmid # 54249). COS-7 or Huh7.5 stably expressing IFI6 3xFLAG were plated at 5,000 cells per well into 8-well chamber slides. The next day cells were transfected with 75ng/well (Huh7.5) or 20ng/well (COS-7) of mEmerald-Sec61\u03b2, or 75ng/well of pTRIP.Mito.EGFP (kindly provided by C. Rice). Cells were as stained as described above with anti-GFP antibody (Abcam #6556, 1:4000) and FLAG-M2 (Sigma #3165, 1:1000).\n\nU-2 OS HDR cells.-U-2 OS cells were plated at 5,000 cells per well onto 8-well chamber slides. The next day, cells were transfected with 75ng/well of mEmerald-Sec61\u03b2 and 6 h post transfection treated with 1000 U/mL of IFN\u03b1. Cells were stained with antibodies against FLAG and GFP as described above.\n\nN32-GFP localization.-COS-7 cells were plated at 5,000 cells per well onto 8-well chamber slides. The next day cells were transfected with 75ng/well of SCRPSY.IFI6(N32)GFP-nlsBFP. Twenty-four hours post transfection cells were stained with antibodies against FLAG and the ER retention KDEL sequence (Enzo #ADI-SPA-827, 1:250).\n\nDENV NS4B localization.-IFI6-3xF-expressing Huh7.5 cells were plated at 5,000 cells per well into 8-well chamber slides. Cells were infected with DENV at MOI of 2 for 2h. Cells were incubated for 48 h and stained with antibodies targeting DENV NS4B (ThermoFisher, 1:200) and FLAG (Sigma, 1:1000). Images were acquired using a Zeiss 880 laser scanning confocal microscope with Airyscan for super resolution capability. Images were deconvolved using AutoQuant X3. Deconvolved images were analyzed for colocalization using Imaris 7.7.2, where a background subtraction was performed, and a threshold for pixel intensity was automatically determined by the software. Pearson values shown indicate the overlap in the automatically determined region of interest (ROI).\n\nApproximately 2 \u00d7 10 6 Huh7.5 cells stably transduced with SCRPSY.empty or SCRPSY.IFI6 lentivirus were seeded into 10cm 2 tissue culture dishes. The next day, cells were mock infected or infected with YFV-17D at 1 MOI. Cells were processed 24 h postinfection for electron microscopy as previously described 33 . For immunogold labeling, COS-7 cells stably expressing SCRPSY.IFI6-HA were fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Cells were permeabilized with 0.25% saponin in phosphate buffer (PB) for 30 min and blocked with 5% goat serum in 0.01% saponin in PB for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with anti-HA antibody (BioLegend #901501, 1:1000 dilution) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The next day, cells were washed 4 times with PB, followed by incubation with 1.4 nm gold-conjugated fragment antigen-binding (Fab) goat antibodies to mouse IgG (Nanoprobes #7202, 1:100) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing 5 times with PB, cells were further fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde and washed 3 times with PB. After rinsing with water, the immunogoldlabeled samples were gold-enhanced for 2.5 min using the gold enhancement kit (Nanoprobes) and washed again with water and 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer. Cells were then post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and 0.8 % K 3 [Fe(CN 6 )] in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1h at room temperature and en bloc stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate.\n\nSamples were then dehydrated with increasing concentration of ethanol, infiltrated with Embed-812 resin and polymerized in a 60\u00b0C oven overnight. Blocks were sectioned with a diamond knife (Diatome) on a Leica Ultracut UCT (7) ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems) and collected onto copper grids. Images were acquired on a Tecnai G 2 spirit transmission electron microscope (FEI) equipped with a LaB 6 source using a voltage of 120 kV.\n\nQuantitative RT-PCR for ISGs.-For gene expression assays, total RNA was isolated from cells stably expressing IFI6, or alternatively, after treatment with 0 or 100 U/mL IFN\u03b1. RNA was isolated using a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). 50 ng total RNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR using QuantiFast SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Commercially available QuantiTect Primers specific for IFI27, IFI27L1, IFI27L2, IRF1, IFITM3, RSAD2, IFIT1, HSPA5, and RPS11 housekeeping control (Qiagen) were used according to manufacturer's instructions. Lab-generated IFI6 and OAS2 primer sets were also used (Supplementary \n\nHuh7.5 cells stably expressing IFI6-3xFLAG were collected from confluent 15cm 2 tissue culture dishes and resuspended in 2mL of cold 0.25M sucrose. Cells were lysed in a 2mL tight fitting Dounce homogenizer with 200 strokes on ice to yield approximately 90% lysis. The lysate was centrifuged at 2,500 x g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C to pellet debris. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and pelleted at 20,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C to pellet membranes. Pellets were resuspended in 2mL PBS, PBS with 1M NaCl, PBS with 0.1M Na 2 CO 3 (pH 11.5), or PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The samples were mixed with 2mL of cold 60% Histodenz (Sigma) and transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube (Beckman Coulter Ultra-Clear 14\u00d795mm). To avoid mixing, the sample was overlaid with gentle pipetting of 4mL of cold 20% Histodenz in PBS/Sucrose, and finally with 4mL of cold 10% Histodenz in PBS/Sucrose. Additional 10% Histodenz in PBS/Sucrose was used to bring the tube volume to ~1mm from the rim of the tube. Alternatively, in some experiments, samples were loaded onto an iodixanol (Sigma) gradient. Samples were centrifuged at 35,000rpm (~209,000 x g) in a SW40Ti rotor for 16 h.\n\nSamples were collected in 1mL fractions from the top of the tube and mixed with 1mL 2x SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. 20\u03bcL aliquots were analyzed by western blot with anti-FLAG, anti-calnexin, or anti-RFP antibodies as described above.\n\nApproximately 1.5\u00d710 6 Huh7.5 cells stably expressing IFI6-3xFLAG were collected for each condition and pelleted. Cells were resuspended and lysed gently at 4\u00b0C with nutation for 15 minutes in 250\u03bcL of a buffer containing 20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1.5mM MgCl 2 , 150mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 5% glycerol, and 1 protease inhibitor pellet (Roche) per 10mL of solution. When used, ATP was included at a final concentration of 2mM (Sigma #A6559). Cells were then pelleted at 16,000xg for 8 minutes at 4\u00b0C. An affinity gel containing 4% agarose beads with FLAG-M2 antibody covalently bound (Sigma #F2426) was equilibrated in washing buffer (20mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 250mM NaCl, 0.2% NP-40, 1.5mM MgCl 2 , 5% glycerol). 5-10% of cleared lysate was collected as inputs and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. The remaining lysate was added to the beads and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C on a rotator. The next morning, the supernatant was collected and beads were washed four times with washing buffer. A 3xFLAG peptide (Sigma #4799) was used to elute bound products off the column at 4\u00b0C with constant vortexing for one hour. Input samples and eluted products were run on a SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane, which was probed with antibodies against BiP or FLAG (rabbit polyclonal).\n\n293T cells plated at 400,000 cells per well in 6-well plates were transfected with pTRIP.CMV.IVSB-CCL2-1xFLAG or pTRIP.CMV.IVSB-IFI6-3xFLAG plasmids using X-tremeGENE 9 (Roche). The next day, media was removed and 1 ml Optimem (Gibco) with or without 1\u03bcg/mL BrefeldinA was added to cells. After 5 h, supernatants were removed and proteins precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Cells were harvested with Accumax and post-nuclear cell lysates were analyzed by western blot with anti-FLAG or anti-actin antibodies as described above.\n\n293T, 293T Control sgRNA, or 293T SPCS1-KO cells (latter two kindly provided by M. Diamond) were plated at 400,000 cells per well in 6-well plates. As indicated, cells were transfected with pTRIP.XKB-2K-NS4B-HA, pTRIP.XKB-C-prM-HA, pTRIP.CMV.IVSB-IFI6-3xFLAG, pTRIP.CMV.IVSB-GFP-1xFLAG, pQCXIP-DENV-NS2B-NS3 (WT or S135A, gifts from M. Gack), and MRX-HA-STING (gift from N. Yan) plasmids using X-tremeGENE 9 (Roche). The next day, cells were harvested with Accumax and post-nuclear cell lysates were analyzed by western blot with anti-FLAG, anti-HA or anti-actin antibodies as described above.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software. In all figures, data points and bar graphs represent the mean of independent biological replicates. In all graphs, error bars represent standard deviation and are only shown for experiments with n=3 or greater. In bar graphs, individual data points are overlaid.
