{"title": "A Cryptosporidium PI(4)K inhibitor is a drug candidate for cryptosporidiosis", "body": "Infections that cause diarrhea are responsible for nearly 800,000 deaths every year, mostly among young children in resource poor settings1. Recently, the apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium was found to be one of the leading causes of infectious diarrhea in children 2,3and Infection with this parasite is strongly associated with mortality, growth stunting, and developmental deficits4. The major human pathogens causing cryptosporidiosis, C. hominis and C. parvum, infect the epithelial cells of the intestine and, through a mechanism that is not fully understood, trigger severe watery diarrheal symptoms. These are particularly longlasting and often life-threatening in malnourished and immunocompromised children4. Nitazoxanide, the only approved drug for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis has limited efficacy in those most vulnerable patient populations5,6. Cryptosporidiosis is also a wellrecognized opportunistic infection in adult AIDS and transplant patients4. Infection occurs through ingestion of the spore-like oocyst stage which shows remarkable resistance to water chlorination. Therefore, even in countries that apply advanced water treatment infection is common, Cryptosporidium is the cause of 50% or disease outbreaks linked to recreational water use in the United States. The search for cryptosporidiosis therapeutics has been hindered by the many technical challenges faced when working with this notoriously intractable parasite7. Here we establish a cryptosporidiosis drug discovery screening process combining phenotypic in vitro assays with novel animal models that take advantage of transgenic parasites8.\n\nTo discover new treatments for cryptosporidiosis we assembled a set of 6220 compounds with known activity against various protozoan parasites and screened against C. parvum in a high content imaging infection assay in HCT-8 cells (see supplementary materials). Notably, many anti-malarials (spiroindolones9, cyclomarins10 and imidazolopiperazines11) lacked activity against Cryptosporidium, however 154 compounds showed >60% growth inhibition at 5 \u03bcM. Secondary screening using a novel cytopathic effect (CPE) based C. parvum assay confirmed several scaffolds, with imidazopyrazines12,13 and pyrazolopyridines14 showing sub-micromolar cellular activity (Fig. 1a -d and Table 1 , structures provided in Extended Data Fig.1 ). We evaluated \u02dc200 pyrazolopyridine analogs and found correlation between activity against C. parvum and Plasmodium falciparum (R 2 =0.702, Fig. 1d ) suggesting that the mechanism of action of pyrazolopyridines is conserved between these two parasites. No such correlation was observed with toxicity against HepG2 (R 2 =0.071) (Extended Data Fig.  2 ). C. hominis is responsible for the majority of clinical infections15. We thus evaluated a subset of pyrazolopyridine analogs against C. hominis, and found potency comparable to C. parvum (R 2 =0.872, Fig. 1e and Table 1 ).\n\nKnowing that pyrazolopyridines and imidazopyrazines exert their antimalarial activity through inhibition of the Plasmodium lipid kinase PI(4)K 12,16, we searched for potential Cryptosporidium orthologs. The genomes of both C. parvum and C. hominis encode multiple putative lipid kinases and the PI(4)K catalytic domain of cgd8_4500 and its C. hominis homolog Chro.80518 show 71.8% amino acid sequence similarity to P. falciparum PI(4)K. We expressed cgd8_4500 in insect cells and purified the protein (CpPI(4)K) which displays phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase activity with a K m for ATP and PI of 3 and 0.4 \u03bcM, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 3 ). Using this assay, we showed that the imidazopyrazine KDU691 and the pyrazolopyridine KDU731 are potent inhibitors of CpPI(4)K enzymatic activity with IC 50 values of 17 and 25 nM, respectively (Fig. 1f) . Both compounds have a >50 fold selectivity window against the human PI(4)K III\u03b2 homologue (Extended Data Table 1 ).\n\nWhen we measured diverse imidazopyrazine and pyrazolopyridine analogs against CpPI(4)K enzymatic activity and C. parvum growth in cells we found tight correlation (R 2 =0.902) (Fig. 1g) , suggesting that the anti-Cryptosporidium activity is directly mediated by CpPI(4)K inhibition. Further genetic and structural insights are needed to unambiguously establish PI4(K) as the target. However, we note that the Plasmodium PI(4)K inhibitors diaryl-aminopyridine (MMV390048)17 and quinoxaline (BQR695)12 which are inactive against C. parvum and C. hominis do not inhibit CpPI(4)K enzymatic activity (Fig. 1f) .\n\nFinally, mechanistic studies revealed an increased K m for ATP in the presence of KDU731 (Fig. 1h) , suggesting ATP-competitive inhibition similarly to what was previously observed for the Plasmodium enzyme12. Additional structure-activity relationship analysis of pyrazolopyridines against Cryptosporidium is found in the supplementary information.\n\nTaken together our data suggest that pyrazolopyridines are inhibitors of CpPI(4)K that bind to the ATP-binding site of the enzyme with a favorable selectivity window over human PI(4)K.\n\nThe most urgent need for effective cryptosporidiosis treatment is among children under the age of two. A very safe drug profile is thus a key component of the target product profile18,19. KDU731 has a selectivity index of more than 100 (CC 50 HepG2 = 15.6 \u03bcM and CpCPE EC 50 = 0.1 \u03bcM) (Extended Data Table 1 ). In a battery of safety pharmacology assays, the compound does not show intrinsic risks for cardiotoxicity, mutagenicity, clastogenicity, or phototoxicity and it does not significantly bind to a panel of human antitargets (Extended Data Table 1 and 2). KDU731 safety was further evaluated in a 2-week toxicology study in rats using a solid dispersion formulation to maximize systemic exposure (\u02dc25 fold). In this study, no significant histopathological changes and only minor changes in clinical chemistry and hematology were observed (slight elevation of chloride and phosphate ions and increase in red blood cells, see supplementary materials). Importantly, no hematopoietic toxicity related to potential inhibition of PI3K or PI4K lipid kinases was observed, suggesting that the in vitro selectivity of KDU731 translated to lack of host toxicity in vivo (Extended Data Table 1 ). Children with cryptosporidiosis in resource limited settings frequently suffer co-morbidities including HIV, TB, and other infections, anticryptosporidial drugs will thus likely be used along with other medications and the risk of drug-drug interactions needs to be minimized. Consistent with the requirement, KDU731 did not inhibit any of the major Cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and did not induce human pregnane X receptor (Extended Data Table 1 ). KDU731 pharmacokinetics, metabolism and distribution was examined in mice, rats and rhesus monkeys. Upon intravenous administration, KDU731 displayed a low to moderate volume of distribution (Vss = 1.12 and 2.15 liter/kg), a low total systemic clearance (CL= 6.8 and 16 ml/min /kg) and a half-life ranging from 1-4 hours (Extended Data Table 3 ). KDU731 orally-administered in suspension formulation displayed a moderate half-life (T 1/2 = 2-4 h) in all three species. KDU731 was selected as a drug candidate because it shows moderate-to-low oral bioavailability (37% in rodents, 9% in non-human primates). As Cryptosporidium primarily infects the intestinal epithelium, we reasoned that systemic exposure may not be required for efficacy and that limiting systemic exposure may further enhance the safety margin of a cryptosporidiosis drug.\n\nCurrent assessment of cryptosporidiosis treatments relies on laborious methods to quantify the parasite in animals. We used genetically-modified parasites to build more facile models. We established the EC 50 of KDU731 for transgenic parasites8 in HCT-8 using Nanoluciferase (Nluc) as a readout and found it comparable to wildtype parasites (Extended Data Fig. 4a ). Next, we inoculated 6-8 week old C57BL/6 IFN-\u03b3-knockout mice with 10,000 oocysts and monitored infection following parasite-derived luciferase activity in the feces (Fig. 2a) . Infected mice were treated orally with KDU731 in suspension formulation and parasite load was measured in the pooled feces by Nluc and quantitative PCR assay with a high degree of correlation (Spearman coefficient=0.786; two-tailed P=0.048). The Nluc assay has a small sample requirement (20 mg) and thus could be conducted on individual mice as well as pooled feces (unpaired t-test comparing means of individual and pooled readings showed no significant difference, two-tailed P=0.3862). Importantly, KDU731 dramatically reduced oocyst shedding regardless of assay method ( Fig. 2b and Extended Data Fig. 4b and c, non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, pooled Nluc two-tailed P <0.001; fecal qPCR two-tailed P=0.0042). In a modified design, KDU731 (10 mg/kg) treatment was initiated at the peak of infection again resulting in significant reduction of oocyst shedding ( Fig. 2a and c) . At the end of the treatment period three mice per group were killed and intestines were processed for histology. We did not observe parasites in the intestines of treated animals while those that received vehicle showed substantial infection (Fig. 2d ).\n\nTo dynamically evaluate the impact of treatment on parasite load directly in the intestinal tissue, we engineered a new reporter parasite amenable to detection by whole-animal imaging. Mice were infected with parasites expressing red-shifted firefly luciferase20 (Fluc) and imaged following D-luciferin injection. Intestinal tissue load was quantified by PCR and we found strong correlation with tissue luminescence (R 2 = 0.8, Extended Data Fig 6 b,c) . KDU731 treatment of mice infected with Fluc parasites was initiated on day 7 when all mice registered high levels of abdominal luciferase activity and mice were imaged daily. Tissue load dropped markedly within 2 days of treatment, and fell below the limit of detection after five days ( Fig. 2e and g) . Changes in luminescence imaging were mirrored by fecal oocyst shedding quantified by PCR (Spearman coefficient =0.840, two-tailed P= 0.0006, Extended Data Fig 6a) . For comparison we evaluated nitazoxanide at 100 mg/kg and observed no change ( Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 5 ), consistent with previous reports on immunosuppressed hosts5,21.\n\nNewborn calves are naturally susceptible to C. parvum infection resulting in fecal oocyst shedding, profuse watery diarrhea and severe dehydration, which closely mirrors human symptomology22,23. We challenged 13 neonatal calves with 5 x 10 7 oocysts. Over the duration of enrollment, a complete physical examination was performed every 12 h and clinical data including appetite, mentation, fecal consistency, and hydration status were recorded (Fig. 3) to assign a clinical a score on a scale of 1 (normal) to 3 (severe) in accordance with previously described methods (see rubric in supplementary information)22-24. Fecal oocyst shedding was enumerated every 24 h by qPCR. The treatment group (n = 7) was subjected to oral treatment with 5 mg/kg KDU731 in suspension formulation every 12 h for 7 days. Treatment was initiated upon development of fulminant diarrhea and fecal oocyst shedding, between day 2 and day 4 post-infection.\n\nAll calves tolerated KDU731 treatment without compound related abnormalities and treated calves shed significantly fewer oocysts than vehicle treated calves within 3 days of treatment (p <0.0001 on day 3) (Fig. 3b ). Treated calves suffered fewer days of severe diarrhea (twotailed P = 0.006) and were significantly less dehydrated (two-tailed P < 0.0001) than controls ( Fig. 3c and d) . Resolution of clinical signs commenced as early as 24 h after treatment was initiated. Within 48 h of treatment 6 out of 7 calves showed no signs of dehydration and within 72 h of treatment 5 of 6 calves had resolution of severe diarrhea (Extended Data Fig. 7 ). KDU731 displayed limited systemic exposure in calves with a C max and AUC of 0.228 \u03bcM and 1.9 \u03bcM.h respectively ( Fig. 3e and Extended Data Table 3) confirming that substantial systemic exposure may not be required for parasite clearance and resolution of clinical illness.\n\nOur studies define the pyrazolopyridine KDU731 as a promising anti-cryptosporidial drug candidate active against both C. parvum and C. hominis. Unlike nitazoxanide, KDU731 demonstrated in vivo efficacy in immunocompromised mice. Additionally, treatment in neonatal calves, which closely matches the pathophysiological and pharmacological challenges faced in the treatment of young malnourished children, led to significant decrease in parasite shedding and rapid resolution of diarrhea and dehydration. Our lead candidate, KDU731, displays good anti-cryptosporidial activity and meets a broad range of safety and pharmacology criteria required for a much needed novel cryptosporidiosis therapeutic intervention. Further safety and pharmacological preclinical evaluation is currently ongoing to support the initiation of human clinical trials.\n\nKDU691, BQR695 and MMV390048 were synthesized as described earlier12,25. Synthesis of KDU731 and other pyrazolopyridine analogs is described in supplementary information and a patent application14.\n\nHuman ileocecal adenocarcinoma cells (HCT-8) were purchased from ATCC (#CCL-34), tested for mycoplasma (at NITD, not at UGA) and maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated horse serum. C. parvum and C. hominis oocysts were purchased from the Sterling Laboratory, University of Arizona and Tufts University Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine. Oocysts were used in infection experiments less than three months from the date of shedding. Excystation and infection protocols followed established methods with modifications26. Oocysts were treated with 10 mM hydrochloric acid (HCl) in 1\u00d7 Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) 10 minutes with agitation at 37\u00b0C, then washed twice with non-acidic 1\u00d7 HBSS. Oocysts were excysted at a density of 10 6 primed oocysts/\u03bcL in parasite infection medium (1:1 Leibovitz's L-15 medium and UltraCULTURE medium supplemented with 2 mM sodium taurocholate, 10 % heatinactivated horse serum, and 200 \u03bcM L-ascorbic acid). All dilutions for subsequent assays were performed in parasite infection medium without sodium taurocholate.\n\nA previously reported C. parvum HCI assay in HCT-8 cells was used with modifications 27,28 and is described in detail in the Supplementary Information.\n\nHigh Content Imaging HCT-8 cell infection assays with C. parvum and C. hominis were conducted following established protocols27 in 384-well flat black clear-bottom plates using an Opera QEHS (PerkinElmer\u2122) Imaging system. We also developed a cytopathic effect (CPE) based assay monitoring host cell viability using CTG reagent (Promega) that does not require staining or imaging. Further details on EC 50 determination for C. parvum and C. hominis using both assays in a 10-point dose-response with 3-fold compound dilution to be described elsewhere29. The EC 50 of KDU731 was also determined using Nluc expressing parasites8. Briefly, HCT-8 cells were infected with purified Nluc expressing parasites (1000 oocysts per well) and incubated with different concentrations of KDU731 for 48 hours. Culture supernatant was removed from the wells and 200 ul of NanoGlo lysis buffer containing 1:50 of NanoGlo substrate (Promega Corporation) was added to the wells. Lysate was transferred to 96 well plates and luminescence was measured on a Synergy H4 Hybrid Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments)\n\nCytotoxicity against HepG2 ATCC #CRL-10741 was determined as previously described30. Cells were seeded into 384 well plates at 400 cells per well, incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours and exposed to three-fold serially-diluted compounds for 96 hours. Cell viability was monitored using the Cell Counting Kit-8.\n\nThe full-length coding sequence of C. parvum PI(4)K (cgd8_4500) was codon-optimized for baculovirus expression, synthesized and cloned into pFastBac-HTb (Invitrogen) in frame with an amino-terminal polyhistidine tag using the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites.\n\nRecombinant pFastBacHTb-CpPI(4)K bacmid clones were generated by site-specific transposition in E. coli DH10Bac (Invitrogen). The bacmid sequence was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. Bacmid isolation, transfection and selection of the recombinant viruses was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Bac-to-Bac system, Invitrogen). SF9 cells, cultured in SF-900 III serum-free medium, were transfected with recombinant baculovirus at 1/200 (v/v) and incubated at 27 \u00b0C for 72 h. Pellets were collected after centrifugation and re-suspended in cell lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1mM DTT, 20mM imidazole, 0.01% Triton X-100 and 1\u00d7 complete protease inhibitor cocktail without EDTA (Roche Diagnostics). The cell suspension was lysed by sonication and clarified supernatant was loaded onto a 1 ml HisTrap affinity column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1mM DTT, 20mM imidazole, and 1\u00d7 complete protease inhibitor cocktail without EDTA). The column was washed with (buffer A containing 45 mM imidazole and the bound protein was eluted with buffer A with 90 mM imidazole. Fractions containing CpPI(4)K were pooled, concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 and purified by a gel-filtration column (Hi-Load 26/60 Superdex 200, GE Healthcare), equilibrated with 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 1\u00d7 protease inhibitor cocktail without EDTA. Aliquots were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and immediately stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Mutations (CpPI4K-S871L and CpPI4K-H1037Y) were introduced into CpPI(4)K in the pFastBac plasmid using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutant proteins were expressed, purified and assayed as described for the wildtype protein and did not show significant change in their KDU731 IC 50 (see supplementary materials for full detail)\n\nThe CpPI(4)K enzyme assay was described earlier12. Briefly, L-\u03b1-phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipid), dissolved in 3% n-octylglucoside (Roche Diagnostics), was used as lipid substrate using the Transcreener ADP 2 FP detection kit (BellBrook Labs) in black, solid 384-well plates (Corning 3575). The final assay volume was 10 \u03bcl and contained 3 nM CpPI(4)K in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT, 3 \u03bcM ATP, 5 mM Mn 2+ , 0.05% Triton X-100 and 10 \u03bcM phosphatidylinositol/octylglucoside. The enzyme reaction was performed for 50 min at room temperature and stopped by adding 10 \u03bcl of detection mix containing 50mM HEPES, pH7.5, 400mM NaCl, 20mM EDTA, and 0.02% Brij-35, 2 nM AMP Alexa Fluor 633 tracer, and 20 \u03bcg ml \u22121 ADP antibody (BellBrook Labs). Fluorescence polarization measurements were performed on an Infinite M1000 plate reader (Tecan) with \u03bbex = 635 nm and \u03bbem = 680 nm (20-nm bandwidth). IC 50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism software.\n\nSolubility was measured using a miniaturized shake-flask approach and streamlined HPLC analysis as described earlier31. Parallel artificial membrane assays were carried out using a standard protocol32. The metabolic stability in liver microsomes was determined using the compound depletion approach and quantified by LC/MS. The assay measures the rate and extent of metabolism as determined by the disappearance of the parent compound, which allows the determination of in vitro half-life (t 1/2 ), intrinsic clearance and the prediction of metabolic clearance in various species31. Cardiotoxicity and mini-ames genotoxicity33 risk was measured as previously described31. All assays for binding to proteins known to bear potential safety liabilities in humans were high-throughput competitive binding assays using specific radiolabeled ligands31. The phototoxicity assay was performed following OECD Guideline for Testing of Chemicals 432 (in vitro 3T3 NRU phototoxicity test).\n\nKDU731 was subjected to CYP450 inhibition analysis using 3 different isoforms31. The compounds were assessed for time dependent inhibition using CYP3A431. The CYP induction assay was carried out using a PXR receptor binding was assayed using LanthaScreen TR-FRET PXR (SXR) competitive binding assay kit from Invitrogen31.\n\nRodent in vivo PK analysis was conducted using non-randomized CD-1 female mice (n = 4, 6-8 weeks old) and Wister rats (n = 4, 6-8 weeks old). PK studies in monkeys (n = 3) were performed in rhesus macaques as described16. Neonatal calf PK studies were performed as part of the efficacy study on day 1 and day 7 of treatment. All procedures involving animals were reviewed and approved by the respective institutional animal care and use committees. KDU731 was formulated in suspension formulation for p.o. dosing and solution formulation for i.v. dosing as described in Extended Data Table 3 . For rat toxicology studies KDU731 was formulated in solid dispersion (SD). KDU731 (20%) and the required excipients (37.5%Soluplus, 37.5%Eudragit E PO and 5%SLS) were dissolved in ethanol/ dichloromethane (v/v=1:1) at a total solid concentration of 10g/L by sonication and heating to 50\u00b0C. The solution was spray dried using a Buchi B290 Mini spray dryer with an inlet temperature of 75\u00b0C, aspirator set to 100% and pump to 35% followed by overnight drying under vacuum at 40\u00b0C. Amorphous nature was confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction analysis and powder was stored at 4\u00b0C. SD powder suspension was prepared freshly in 0.5% HPMC in 50mM acetate buffer (pH4.7) at 10 mg/mL of KDU731 (equivalent to SD powder 50mg/mL) and rats were dosed within one hour of preparation. Blood samples for PK studies were collected between 0 and 24 h post dose. Compound plasma concentrations were determined by LC/MS. Plasma samples from pharmacokinetic studies were extracted with acetonitrile: methanol: acetic acid (90:9.8:0.2) containing warfarin as an internal standard, using an 8.8:1 extractant to plasma ratio. Analyte quantitation was performed by LC/MS/MS. Liquid chromatography was performed using an Agilent 1200 HPLC system, with the Agilent Zorbax Phenyl (3.5\u03bc, 4.6 x75 mm) column at an oven temperature of 45\u00baC, coupled with a API4000 triple quadruple mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). PK parameters were determined using Watson LIMS, by non-compartmental analysis.\n\nKDU731 solid dispersion powder suspension was prepared freshly in 0.5% HPMC in 50mM acetate buffer (pH4.7) at 10 mg/mL and was orally administered to 5 male Wistar rats at a daily oral dose of 30 and 100 mg/kg/day for two weeks. Five control animals were treated with vehicle only. Rats were obtained from Shanghai SLAC Animal Ltd. and subjected to 3 days of quarantine and acclimatization prior to study begin. All animals were subjected to daily clinical observation, and body weight and food consumption was determined for all animals enrolled in the study. Clinical laboratory evaluations (hematology and clinical chemistry) were performed at the scheduled necropsy on day 15. Organs were examined for gross pathology and weighed prior to fixation and preparation for histology. Samples from organs and tissues prepared from animals assigned to control and high dose groups were examined microscopically. Specifically, the heart, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract (oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, colon, rectum), kidney, liver, spleen, lung, testes, epididymis, adrenals, and thymus were examined for histopathological changes.\n\nThe 5' UTR and 3'UTR of the C. parvum actin gene was amplified from parasite genomic DNA and ligated into KpnI/ClaI and SpeI/BamHI sites of plasmid TK-Eno-Nluc-Neo-TK 8 respectively. The coding sequence for red-shifted luciferase20 was amplified from pTubRE9 vector (kind gift from Markus Meissner, University of Glasgow) and cloned into SalI/NheI restriction sites replacing Nluc. A 404 bp fragment of the 5'TK flank, the tk gene and a ribosomal 3'UTR was inserted upstream of the 5' actin UTR using Gibson Assembly cloning (New England Biolabs). The final vector, along with the Cas9 plasmid containing a TK guide RNA (GAAGAATACAATTTCTAAGG) that targets the 3' end of the tk gene was used to transfect C. parvum sporozoites. Sporozoites were delivered via surgery into the small intestine of C57BL/6 IFN-\u03b3 knockout mice (B6.129S7-Ifngtm1Ts/J, Jackson Laboratories) using procedures described previously8. Note that UGA1 Nluc parasites were generated using C. parvum IOWA II oocysts purchased from Sterling Parasitology Laboratory, University of Arizona whereas the UGA2 Fluc strain was engineered using C. parvum IOWA II oocysts purchased from Bunch Grass Farms, Deary, ID.\n\nAll mouse studies describe in this section were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Georgia (animal use protocol no. A2016 01-028-Y1-A4). C57BL/6 IFN-\u03b3-knockout mice aged 6-8 weeks were selected randomly for each group (n=5) and infected with 10,000 C. parvum UGA1 Nluc8 oocysts. No statistical tests were used to predetermine sample size. KDU731 was formulated in 0.5 % w/v methylcellulose and 0.5%w/v polysorbate in water and administered to mice daily for 7 days by oral gavage beginning on day 3 or day 11 post-infection. Control mice were given only vehicle. Mice were monitored for weight loss, fur ruffling, hunched posture and inactivity. Mice showing a weight loss of <=15% were euthanized. Fecal samples were collected (not blinded) and luminescence measurements were performed as described8 (parasite Nluc activity is stable in feces when refrigerated). Measurements were performed on feces collected from individual mice as well as from cage-wide (pooled) collections. For Nluc assay, 20 mg of feces was mashed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50mM TrisHCl (pH7.6), 2mM DTT, 2mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% triton-X 100), ten 3 mm glass beads were added to the tube followed by vigorous agitation using a vortex mixer for 1 minute and a a short spin to pellet fecal material. Three aliquots of 100 \u03bcl lysate were dispensed into 96 well white plates and an equal amount of NanoGlo reconstituted buffer containing 1:50 of Nano-Glo substrate (Promega) was added, luminescence was read using a Synergy H4 Hybrid Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments).\n\nTo measure oocyst load by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), DNA was isolated from 100 mg of feces. Samples were subjected to five rounds of freezing in liquid nitrogen and thawing in 100\u00b0C heater block prior to DNA isolation using the ZR Fecal DNA miniprep kit (Zymo Research Corp., Irvine, CA). qRT-PCR was performed using sample DNA along with standards prepared from uninfected feces spiked with oocysts. PCR primers JVAF and JAVR and probe 5'FAM labeled JVAR34 were used along with the following cycling parameters: denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 sec, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 30 sec. Each 20\u03bcl PCR reaction contained 10 \u03bcl of SSoAdvanced\u2122 universal probes supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), 0.4375 \u03bcM of each primer, 0.125 \u03bcM probe and 2 \u03bcl DNA.\n\nIFN-\u03b3KO mice (n=5 per group) were infected with 10,000 C. parvum UGA2 Fluc oocysts expressing red-shifted firefly luciferase and given a daily dose of 10 mg/kg KDU731, Nitazoxanide (Sigma) at 100mg/kg, or control formulation for one week by oral gavage starting on day 7 post-infection. Parasite tissue load was measured by in vivo imaging. At the beginning of the experiment the abdominal area of mice was shaved with clippers to increase the signal during imaging on an IVIS Lumina II system, (Caliper Life Sciences). Mice were injected subcutaneously with 125 mg/kg D-luciferin (Gold Biotechnology Inc., St Louis MO, USA). 5 minutes after luciferin injection, mice were anaesthetized in an induction chamber using 3% isofluorane and then placed in the camera chamber. Mice were kept under anesthesia by administering isofluorane through individual nose cones. Images were acquired using a setting of F-stop=1/16, binning= medium and an exposure time of 5 minutes. Regions of interest (ROI) were selected for each mouse and total flux (photons/sec) was quantified using IVIS Lumina II Living Image 4.0 Software (Caliper Life Sciences). To validate measurements of parasite tissue burden, mice infected for one week were imaged, killed and the small intestine was removed and cut into 12 (1 cm) segments, and flushed with PBS. Sections were imaged 3 times in PBS with D-luciferin after which genomic DNA was isolated from each segment using the ZR Fecal DNA miniprep kit (Zymo Research Corp., Irvine, CA). qPCR was performed using parameters described above and parasite burden was established against a standard curve of samples with known parasite DNA content.\n\nMice treated with KDU731 or control formulation were killed and intestinal tissue was collected within 15 minutes of death. Sections of the small intestine were taken from the 1-2 cm region anterior to the cecum, flushed with PBS and fixed overnight in 10% buffered formalin. Fixed samples were embedded in paraffin and 4 \u03bcm sections were cut (RM225 Microtome, Leica, Buffalo Grove, IL). Sections were deparafinized and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.\n\nAll calves used in this study were cared for in compliance with the Washington State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Sample size was calculated assuming that 85% of treated calves had resolution of clinical illness by the end of the treatment period (48 hrs post-administration of treatment #14) as compared to 15% of control calves. Assuming a type I error risk of 5% and a type II error risk of 80%, 7 calves were needed in the treatment group, plus 2 positive controls. In the event of calf death or removal from the study, an additional 4 calves were added to the control group (n = 6). Sample size was calculated using Epi Info. Fifteen Friesian-Holstein bull calves were enrolled in November 2015 and February 2016. At birth, all calves enrolled in November were randomized to treatment with KDU731 (n = 7), positive infection control (n = 2), and negative infection control (n = 1). The 5 calves enrolled in February were positive controls. The perineum of the dam was cleaned with povidone-iodine scrub and calves were delivered onto single-use plastic sheets to prevent exposure to environmental pathogens. Calves with abnormal physical examination findings and those weighing less than 29.5 kg at birth were excluded. Enrolled calves received 4L \u2265 50g IgG/L commercial colostrum replacer (Land O'Lakes Inc.) and a 3 ml subcutaneous injection of vitamin E and selenium (Merck Animal Health). Calves were then transported from the commercial dairy farm to Washington State University where they were housed in individual box stalls in a BSL-2 facility. Shatter-proof mirrors were provided for enrichment. Within 48 h of birth, blood samples were collected and evaluated for adequate passive transfer of colostral immunity. Calves were offered a commercial 20% protein/20% fat non-medicated milk replacer (Land O'Lakes Inc.) every 12 h via nipple bucket. At each feeding, calves were fed an average of 8.8 g of dry matter per kg of birth weight for the duration of the study. Water was provided ad libitum. All calves randomized to treatment or positive control groups were experimentally challenged within the first 48 h of life with 5\u00d710 7 C. parvum oocysts (Iowa II, Bunch Grass Farm, ID) via the rigid portion of an oroesophageal feeding tube. Oocysts were within 1 month of isolation and were cleaned in 0.6% sodium hypochlorite for 1 minute and then washed four times with PBS. The negative control calf was sham-challenged to maintain blinding of study personnel.\n\nTo facilitate collection of blood for plasma pharmacokinetic analysis, a long-term intravenous catheter (MILACATH, MILA International) was aseptically placed in the jugular vein within the first 48-72 hours of life. Calves were sedated with Xylazine 0.1 ml IV (20mg/ml) (Akorn Animal Health). Sedation was reversed with Atipamezole 0.1ml IM (5mg/ml) (Zoetis). Beginning at birth, a fecal sample was collected directly from the rectum every 24 h. A complete physical exam was performed every 12 h and clinical data including appetite, mentation, fecal consistency, and hydration status were recorded. Clinical data was evaluated on a scale of 1 (normal) to 3 (severe) in accordance with previously described methods (see rubric in supplementary information)23,24.\n\nKDU731 was prepared as a 5mg/ml suspension formulation in 0.5% w/v Methylcellulose and 0.5% w/v Tween-80 in water and KDU731 treatment was initiated when a calf began shedding oocysts and had a fecal consistency score of 3. Calves were induced to suckle and then KDU731 was given orally via an oral dosing syringe. Calves were treated every 12 h for 7 days at a dose of 5 mg/kg birth weight at least 2 h after feeding. Pharmacokinetic sampling was conducted on day 1 and day 7 of treatment. Blood was drawn prior to and at multiple time-points following administration. A fecal sample was collected 1 h and 12 h following administration. On days 2-6 of treatment, blood was collected prior to KDU731 administration. On day 3 of life, a fecal sample was tested E. coli K99, on day 7 for Salmonella, rotavirus, and corona virus. Of the 7 treatment calves, two calves (N101 and N107) were randomly selected to be euthanized 24 hours after administration of the final KDU731 treatment. A positive control calf (N104) was also euthanized at the same time. Euthanasia was via captive bolt and induction of bilateral pneumothorax in order to avoid confounding histologic findings. Calves were submitted for necropsy to the Washington State Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. Samples of the liver, spleen, kidney, and small intestine were collected for histologic analysis. The remaining calves continued in the study until the cessation of fecal oocyst shedding as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy (Merifluor, Meridian Diagnostics). Upon cessation of fecal oocyst shedding (2 consecutive negative fecal samples over 48 h), calves were euthanized and submitted to the Washington State Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory for necropsy.\n\nOocysts counts were interpolated by qRT-PCR at the Cornell Animal Health Diagnostic Center using serial dilutions of commercially purified C. parvum oocysts (Waterborne, Inc., New Orleans, LA). Total nucleic acid was extracted from supernatants of 200 mg of fecal sample, oocyst suspension, or negative control homogenized in 400 \u03bcl of PBS using a magnetic bead based automated procedure (AM1840, Applied Biosytems, Foster City, CA). An exogenous control (MS2 phage) was added to the lysis buffer to control for PCR inhibition35. qPCR for Cryptosporidium Spp. 18S rRNA was performed on the Applied Biosystems 7500-FAST platform using commercial master mix (ToughMix, Quantabio) and oligonucleotides previously described36. This count was standardized by the fecal dry weight percentage. 5-10 g portion of each original fecal sample was dried at 108 \u00b0C for a minimum of 24 h (Squaroid Vaccuum Oven, Labline, India) and weighed24.\n\nData were analyzed using descriptive and inferential methods. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine if data were non-Gaussian. Depending on the distribution of data, continuous variables were evaluated using the student's t test, analysis of variance, or the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Analysis of variance was used to assess differences in fecal oocyst counts and fecal consistency score between the KDU731 treated and untreated calves. The effect of co-morbidity on outcomes of interest was evaluated using the student's t test. Data were analyzed using JMP Pro 11.0 (SAS Institute Inc).\n\nExtended Data Figure 1 .

Manjunatha Severity of diarrhea and dehydration in individual calves challenged with 5 x 10 7 C. parvum oocysts. Infected calves were treated with vehicle (n=6) or with KDU731 (n=7); n represents the number of calves. Every 12 h, calves were stimulated to defecate, fecal consistency was evaluated, and hydration status was assessed. Fecal consistency and hydration scores were assigned per the study rubric (see supplementary information). The schematic representation shows the fecal consistency (a) and hydration scores (b) throughout the drug treatment period. Fecal consistency and hydration began to improve within 48 h of initiating treatment with KDU731. a, Mice were infected with 10,000 C. parvum UGA1 Nluc or UGA2 Fluc oocysts. Parasite load in the feces was determined by measuring fecal Nluc activity and parasite tissue load was quantified by whole animal imaging of Fluc activity. Different 7 day treatment courses are indicated in red. Fecal luciferase measurements of individual mice with treatment initiated after 3 (b) or 11 (c) days of infection (red, vehicle control shown in black), n=5 and n=9 mice respectively, representative of two biological replicates for b and c. d, Histology of the ileum of infected mice (shown in c) after one week of KDU731 treatment compared to vehicle treated control on day 18 (n=3 biological replicates, representative images shown here). Note numerous intracellular parasite stages (white arrowheads) and extracellular oocysts (black arrowhead) in the control absent in the treated mice. Vehicle treated animals showed disorganized columnar epithelial cells and loss of brush border when compared to KDU731 treated mice. White box indicates section shown at higher magnification to the right. Mice (n=5) infected with UGA2 FLuc were treated on day 7 with 10mg/kg of KDU731 (red (e) and g), 100 mg/kg nitazoxanide (red (f), also see Extended Data Fig. 5 ), or vehicle (black, e and f) for one week. Animals were monitored by whole-animal-imaging and a radiance scale and quantification of total flux in photon/sec is shown. *Animals shown on the baseline were below the level of detection. a, Within 48 h of birth, calves were challenged with 5x10 7 C. parvum oocysts. Fecal oocyst shedding was enumerated via qPCR and calves were clinically evaluated every 12 h. Oral treatment with KDU731 (5mg/kg every 12 hours for 7 days) was initiated when calves showed severe diarrhea (Fecal Consistency Score = 3) and oocysts in their feces. KDU731 treated calves shed significantly fewer oocysts in their stool (b), had significantly fewer days of severe diarrhea (c) and were significantly less dehydrated (d) than untreated calves. e, Day 1 and day 7 plasma PK profile of KDU731. Data shown here (panels b,c,d, e) are from infected calves that were treated with vehicle (n=6) or KDU731 (n = 7), n represents the number of calves. In vitro EC 90 is shown as dotted line. Error bars are SEM. Data shown here (c and d) as a \"box and whiskers\" plot, the box extends from the 25th to 75th percentiles and whiskers with min to max showing all data points. Data in panel b and e were determined to display non-Gaussian distribution and were log-transformed prior to statistical analysis using t-tests with two-tailed *P<0.05, **0.01, ***0.001, and ****0.0001.\n\nPanels c and d were determined to be normally distributed and analyzed using t-tests.
