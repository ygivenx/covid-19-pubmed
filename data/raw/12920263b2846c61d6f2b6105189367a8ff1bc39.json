{"title": "A diallel of the mouse Collaborative Cross founders reveals strong strain-specific maternal effects on litter size", "body": "A critical part of fitness is optimizing the balance between numbers of offspring, offspring body size, and reproductive timing, leading to strong selection for these traits (Smith and Fretwell 1974; Beauchamp and Kacelnik 1990) . Fundamental fitness traits, like litter size (i.e., the number of pups born per litter), should have low contributions of genetic variance due to rapid fixation of alleles that increase fitness (Mousseau and Roff 1987; Price and Schluter 1991; Meril\u00e4 and Sheldon 1999; Stirling et al. 2002; Peripato et al. 2004) . Estimates of litter size heritability vary from 5% to 20% in mouse, rabbit, and porcine populations (Falconer 1960; Avalos and Smith 1987; Falconer and Mackay 1996; Johnson et al. 1999; Garc\u0131a and Baselga 2002; Peripato et al. 2004; Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2006) leading to the majority of variation in litter size being non-heritable. Nonheritable factors include seasonality, food availability, paternal and maternal effects, dominance and epistasis, as well as unknown factors. Additionally, sexual conflict over parental investment may exist between females and males, and this in turn could affect litter size (Trivers 1974; Hager and Johnstone 2003) . These factors make it difficult to obtain clear measurements of litter size in wild populations. A controlled laboratory environment is therefore necessary to measure genetic effects of litter size (Jinks and Broadhurst 1963; Roberts 1960; Bandy and Eisen 1984; Hoornbeek 1968; Peripato et al. 2004; Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2006; Varona and Sorensen 2014) .\n\nThe Collaborative Cross (CC) and its eight founder strains are an important resource for studying complex traits, establishing mouse models for human disease, and understanding the mouse Diversity Outbred (DO), which originated from the CC (Ferris et al. 2013; Chesler 2014; Rogala et al. 2014; Rasmussen et al. 2014; Gralinski et al. 2015 Gralinski et al. , 2017 Schoenrock et al. 2017; Maurizio et al. 2018) . The CC resource and its founder strains can also be used to study reproductive ability, which is especially interesting because this population has an established record both of breeding successes and of failures. For example, litter size in the early CC lines shows a steady decline over the first six generations of inbreeding (Philip et al. 2011 ). In addition, nearly 95% of all CC lines have become extinct, primarily due to subspecific genomic incompatibilities (Shorter et al. 2017) . Although standard reproductive phenotypes have been measured, mostly in male CC founders (Odet et al. 2015) , the genetic and non-genetic control over CC breeding success has never been thoroughly characterized, and is likely to contain vital information that may be used to improve CC breeding in the future.\n\nGiven the growing popularity of the CC as a community resource, we investigated reproductive ability across the eight founders of the CC to better understand the genetic and nongenetic factors that affect their fertility and breeding. Using an 8\u21e58 diallel design, we measured weaned litter sizes from over 4400 litters arising from 62 crosses across four years of breeding. Adapting a recently developed statistical model of diallel effects (Lenarcic et al. 2012) , we quantified both the genetic contributions that shape litter size and the contributions of several environmental factors. Our results provide a detailed account of breeding patterns across and between the eight founders. This experiment also informs us about genetic combinations that are highly or marginally productive in the CC, helping us to better understand CC fertility problems and line extinction.\n\nThe mouse inbred strains used in these experiments are the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) (Collaborative The number of litters observed per cross is given by the integers, with the largest sample sizes, along the diagonal, corresponding to the production of inbred parental strains. Column and row sums are given along the bottom row and rightmost column, respectively. A total of 4,448 litters were evaluated for this analysis, resulting in a total of 24,782 weaned pups. The shading within each box corresponds to the average number of weaned pups per litter in each cross, with averages ranging from 3.6 to 9.1 pups per litter. Litters for which no pups survived until weaning were not included in our analysis. The symbol \"\u21e5\" is used to indicate incompatible crosses that do not produce any litters.\n\nCross Consortium 2012). The founders of the CC include five classical strains, A/J (AJ), C57BL/6J (B6), 129S1/SvImJ (129S1), NOD/ShiLtJ (NOD), NZO/HlLtJ (NZO), and three wild-derived strains, CAST/EiJ (CAST), PWK/PhJ (PWK), and WSB/EiJ (WSB). Mice originated from a colony maintained by Gary Churchill at Jackson Laboratory, and were transferred to the FMPV lab at the University of North Carolina (UNC) in 2008. The original colony also produced most of the G1 breeders that populated the inbred funnels at ORNL, TAU and Geniad (Srivastava et al. 2017 \n\nTesting environmental interactions. Significant environmental interactions were determined using ANOVA, using JMP 12 software (JMP\u00ae, Version 12. SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 1989 -2007 . Tested effects included a season effect (average weaned litter size in each month over every year), non-seasonal factors using a year-bymonth effect (average weaned litter size for all months across all years), and a litter order effect (average weaned litter size in each subsequent dam litter). We performed the ANOVA on litter size counts from the eight inbred matings only, because of their robust sample sizes throughout the four years of breeding.\n\nTo estimate the overall contributions of heritable factors affecting litter size in our population, we adapted a previously published linear mixed model, Bayes-Diallel (Lenarcic et al. 2012) , which performs this estimation for continuous phenotypes, to the setting of a discrete count-based phenotype. To do this we reimplemented the BayesDiallel Gibbs sampler as a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) using the R software package MCMCglmm (Hadfield 2010) . Let y i be the number of pups born to litter i, where y i 2 N + , and denote the corresponding pair of parental strains, namely maternal strain j and paternal strain k, using the notation {jk}[i]. The effect of parental strains on y i was modeled using an overdispersed zero-truncated Poisson (ZTP) regression (data scales of the model in brackets):\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ZTPois(l i ) denotes a Poisson distribution with expected value l i but conditional on having observed that y i 6 = 0 (Appendix A), g is the link function g(x) = log(x), with inverse g 1 (x) = e x , that relates l i to a latent scale`i, and h i is a linear predictor on that latent scale with an error term # i \u21e0 N(0, s 2 ) providing overdispersion. The linear predictor h i is then composed of an intercept \u00b5, random effects for litter order (i.e., parity) u order [i] and batch (month) u batch[i] respectively (detailed below), where for example batch[i] refers to the batch containing litter i, and a further linear predictor d T {jk}[i] b (detailed below) that specifies the contributions of parental strains j and k (detailed below). The random effects for litter order and batch were both modeled as categorical random intercepts, u batch \u21e0 N(0, t 2 batch ) and u order \u21e0 N(c order \u00b7 a, t 2 order ), where litter order is additionally predicted by c order , the order as a number, with fixed effect a.\n\nThe parental strain contribution d T {jk} b, is equivalent to the 'fullu' (full, unsexed) model described in (Lenarcic et al. 2012) , and is given below:\n\nwhere I {A} is an indicator and equal to 1 if A is true and 0 otherwise, S {A} is a sign variable equal to 1 2 if A is true and 1 2 otherwise, b inbred is a fixed effect of being inbred, and all other variables (in classes a, m, b, v, w) are modeled as random effects with class-specific variances, for example, a 1 , . . . , a 8 are modeled as a j \u21e0 N(0, t 2 a ). The a (\"additive\") class represents strain-specific dosage effects, the m (\"parental sex\") class represents asymmetric parent-of-origin effects, where positive values indicate that maternal effects are greater than paternal effects for a given strain, inbred penalty effects are comprised of overall (fixed) and strain-specific (random) b parameters, and epistatic effects are strain-pair specific deviations, both symmetric (v) and asymmetric (w).\n\nTo provide directional parent-of-origin effects for maternal and paternal strain we defined, by reparameterization of the additive and parental sex effect, the following two additional types of effect:\n\nis the B6-specific dam (maternal strain) effect and sire B6 = a B6 m B6 is the B6-specific sire (paternal strain) effect. Posterior samples of these quantities were obtained as a post-processing step by reparameterizing posterior samples of a j and m j . Obtaining these as a post-processing step, rather than explicit modification of Equation 2, preserves the original Bayes-Diallel model and therefore has no effect on the effect estimates (or variance projection estimates) for the other diallel categories. (Parameter definitions summarized in Table S1 .)\n\nPriors were chosen to be minimally informative. For fixed effects (\u00b5, a, and b inbred ) we used N 0, 1 \u21e5 10 3 . For variances of random effects (s 2 , t 2 a , t 2 m , t 2 b , t 2 v , t 2 w , t 2 order , t 2 batch ) we used an inverse gamma distribution with scale and shape both equal to 0.001. Posterior effect estimates are presented as posterior mean (and median), and the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval.\n\nIn order to stably estimate the contribution of each variance class to the overall phenotype, we used the diallel variance projection [VarP; Crowley et al. (2014) ]. This is a heritability-like measure that partitions the overall phenotypic variance of an idealized future diallel experiment into additive, parent-of-origin (parental sex), inbred (dominance), epistatic, and other random/fixed effects categories in the diallel. VarPs were calculated both from the ZTP model described above, and, for comparison, from the standard Gaussian-outcome BayesDiallel model (using the Bayes-Diallel software) (Appendix A). The standard BayesDiallel model was applied to our data after litter size was subject to a variancestabilizing transformation, the square root, this corresponding to the linear mixed model approximation to the ZTP,\n\nThe standard BayesDiallel model under this transformation was also used to evaluate evidence in our data set for the inclusion (or exclusion) of each variable or class of variables in improving the model fit. Specifically, we calculated for each variance class a Volume X October 2018 | Fertility in a CC founder diallel cross | 3\n\nAll rights reserved.

The eight inbred strains, displayed across the diagonal, were mated at higher frequencies both for maintenance of inbred strains and propagation of the diallel. For all 62 genetic inbred and hybrid crosses, we recorded the following information: mated pairs, wean dates, litter size at weaning, including total and sex-specific counts (File S1). This diallel cross was originally designed and maintained for the generation of F1 mice for several experimental projects (Koturbash et al. 2011; Aylor et al. 2011; Mathes et al. 2011; Kelada et al. 2012; Didion et al. 2012; Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012; Calaway et al. 2013; Crowley et al. 2014; Phillippi et al. 2014; Odet et al. 2015; Crowley et al. 2015; Morgan et al. 2016; Percival et al. 2016; Shorter et al. 2017; Oreper et al. 2017; Maurizio et al. 2018) . As a result, certain reproductive measurements such as time between litters and maximum number of offspring per cross were necessarily biased by experimental breeding requirements. Average weaned litter size, however, is a reproductive trait that should be well-estimated independently of these factors. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/458877 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nWe measured litter size and report the mean number of weaned pups per litter for the 62 viable crosses in the diallel (Figure 1) . A wide distribution of litter sizes was observed, ranging from an average of 3.6 weaned pups for WSB\u21e5WSB crosses, to an average of 9.1 weaned pups for NOD\u21e5PWK crosses, with an overall mean of 5.5 weaned pups per litter. Examining average litter sizes of the inbred strains across all 4 years, we found neglible evidence of consistent seasonal effects (F 11,2283 = 1.272 p = 0.23) ( Figure S4 ) but positive evidence of non-seasonal patterns: a modeled 'year.month' covariate significantly affected litter size (F 47,2247 = 2.44 p < .0001; see also Figure S5 ). The non-seasonal effect could be driven by the relocation of mice between vivariums, which occurred in February 2010. The housing facility may have an impact on litter size as well. To test this, we measured average litter size differences between the two housing facilities and found that two founder strains, 129S1 and WSB, had significantly larger average litter sizes at the Hillsborough facility than at UNC GMB with a difference of 5.87 to 4.42 weaned pups per litter (p < 0.0001) for 129S1, and 3.84 to 3.42 weaned pups per litter (p = 0.029) for WSB. The six other founder strains did not significantly differ in their average litter sizes between the two facilities, but tended to have smaller weaned litters at UNC GMB (see Discussion). For average litter size across the diallel, we tested for an effect of litter number (birth parity number, for a given mating pair) on the number of pups weaned in each litter. Previous research suggests that the first litter can be significantly smaller than subsequent litters due to various biological factors (De la Fuente and San Primitivo 1985). This effect was consistent in the diallel: we observed that there was significant reduction in litter size in the first litter (p < 0.0001) compared to the overall linear effect that parity has on reducing litter size ( Figure S5 ).\n\nTo estimate founder strain effects on litter size, we used a Bayesian regression model that decomposes the phenotypic variation in a diallel design into genetic and parent-of-origin contributions (Lenarcic et al. 2012 ). Using this model, litter size was estimated to have narrow sense heritability (h 2 approximated by VarP[additive]) accounting for 9.18% of the variance, with parent-of-origin effects (VarP[parental.sex]) accounting for 5.77%, the fact of being inbred (VarP[inbred.overall]) at 1.43%, and strain-by-strain interactions (VarP[epistatic.symmetric] + VarP[asymmetric.epistatic]) at 3.40% ( Figure 2A ); in aggregate, these factors explained 17.73% of the total variance for litter size in the founder diallel.\n\nIn more detail, we present estimates for all modeled diallel effects as posterior means and highest posterior density (HPD) intervals ( Figure 2B ). Parameters are divided into two groups: general effects and strain pair-specific effects. General effects comprise strain-specific additive effects (additive), strain-specific and overall inbred (inbred), and strain-specific parent-of-origin (parental sex) effects. Strain pair-specific (epistatic) effects are the effects that arise specifically in crosses of two heterologous strains, with 'v' referring to symmetric epistatic and 'w' referring to asymmetric epistatic effects (pairwise parent-of-origin effects). All classes of effect were determined to add positive value to the model fit (either strong or very strong evidence for inclusion; MIP > 0.986) except parental sex (the difference between male and female), whose value was equivocal (MIP=0.34) Table S2 ).\n\nUnder the general effects, we see significant positive additive effects on average litter size from B6, NOD, and NZO and significant negative additive effects on litter size from CAST, PWK, and WSB strain dosages. A similar pattern is seen in the parental sex effects, where B6 and NOD dosages have a significant positive effect on average litter size, whereas CAST, PWK, and WSB have significant negative effects. The \"inbred\" effect is negative indicating that inbred status has a negative overall effect on average litter size, regardless of parental strain. Each strain also has an individual inbred effect in addition to an overall inbred effect; the only strain with a positive inbred effect is NOD. When the individual inbred effects are taken into account with the overall \"inbred\" effect, inbred litters are on average slightly smaller than their heterozygous counterparts. For strain pair-specific epistatic effects, there are a few marginally noteworthy effects, with the most prominent being a negative asymmetric epistatic effect for PWK\u21e5NOD.\n\nTo more clearly differentiate the contributions of the mother vs. the father strain, we reparameterized the BayesDiallel model to capture effects specific to dam.strain and sire.strain (Figure 3) . B6 and NOD dams increase litter sizes by more than 1.26 fold, by an average of 1.66 and 1.79 pups, respectively, regardless of sire. CAST, PWK, and WSB dams tend to decrease average litter size by 0.90, 0.81, and 1.51 pups. The sire effect is similar, with NOD and NZO sires having larger litters and CAST sires producing smaller litters. As expected, we see that the dam.strain has a much larger influence on the variation of litter size compared with the sire.strain (13.15% vs. 1.81%).\n\nVolume X October 2018 | Fertility in a CC founder diallel cross | 5 All rights reserved.

The overall mean for sex bias, quantified as number of male pups weaned divided by the total number of weaned pups, was 0.4979, and did not significantly differ from our expectation of a 50:50 sex ratio (Binominal test, two-tailed p = 0.219). For the eight inbred founders, 129S1 is the only strain that departed significantly from expectation, with slight reduction of males 0.475:0.525 (Binominal test, two-tailed p = 0.041). However, correction for multiple testing shows no significant sex ratio bias of any inbred strain. The outbred crosses have substantially fewer litters and offspring than the inbred matings, leading to less balanced sex ratios; however, when multiple testing is accounted for, they also show no significant deviations from expected sex ratios.\n\nWe have investigated factors influencing litter size in the eight CC founders and their F1 hybrids. We note that litter size is a component of reproductive performance, but distinct from total strain productivity; a study on total strain productivity would need to take into account litter size, numbers of litters, maximum reproductive age, and pup survival until breeding. Our results illustrate how mammalian litter size in a full diallel design is influenced by genotypic and environmental variation. They also address some of the factors that contributed to line extinction and breeding problems in generating the CC (Chesler et al. 2008; Philip et al. 2011; Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012; Shorter et al. 2017) .\n\nWe estimated that genetic (additive, inbred, and epistatic) effects on average litter size explained 17.73% of variation, suggesting that most of the phenotypic variation arises from unexplained environmental effects. Within the explained variance, our estimate of the narrow sense heritability (h 2 = 0.092) for litter size may seem small, but it is within the range uncovered in previous research (Falconer 1960; Peripato et al. 2004; Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2006) . Compared with the overall average litter, we observed substantial positive effects of B6 and NOD strains, from both additive genetic and parent-of-origin parameters, and substantial negative effects of PWK and WSB (Figure 2) . We also observed, as expected, that lower litter size was associated with being inbred (Figure 2A) .\n\nDuring the G1 and G2 out-crossing generations of the CC, mean litter size was lower for crosses involving wild-derived strains, CAST, PWK and WSB (Philip et al. 2011) . A similar pattern is observed here, but these effects are determined to be specifically through the maternal strain, with CAST, PWK and WSB having negative \"dam\" effects on litter size (Figure 3) . It is likely that selection pressure in classical lab strains is associated with larger litters compared with the wild-derived strains. Additionally, two of the wild-derived strains, CAST and PWK, are from a different subspecific origin than the other six CC founders. This likely contributes to decreased productivity through subspecific incompatibilities (Shorter et al. 2017) .\n\nWe identify and report environmental factors that may influence litter size. The breeding of this diallel was performed across two different vivariums over the course of 4 years, and we see a significant effect from housing facility. The Hillsborough facility was associated with larger litters for all strains, especially 129S1 and WSB. The two facilities have many different factors that could explain these differences. The Hillsborough facility housed multiple species, including dogs and mice, had smaller rooms that held approximately 300 mouse cages, was remotely located in a rural area, had different laboratory personnel, had cage changes once a week, and was supplied with filtered well water. The diallel breeding at the GMB facility took place in a large central room, contained only laboratory mice, is located in a basement of a large seven story research building on campus, has cage changes every other week, and is supplied with filtered city water. It is possible that one or more of these factors, independently or in combination, affected productivity. Another finding was that seasonality, which has previously been shown to influence litter size and frequency of litters in mammals (Drickamer 1990) , did not seem to significantly impact litter size in this study. This is likely due to consistent light-dark cycles and temperatures as well as a steady diet. We did observe a significant effect on litter size after the transfer of the mice to the UNC GMB facility (February 2010), which reduced overall litter sizes from March to June 2010. This may have been due to the use of ivermectin during the time of the transfer. Other factors, such as the sex of the laboratory personnel interacting with the animals, are generally known to influence rodent behavior and could contribute to some of the environmentally-induced variation we observed (Sorge et al. 2014) .\n\nLast, we measured sex ratio across all inbred and outbred crosses. Despite some departures from equality at the nominal significance threshold (alpha = 0.05), no associations with founder strain dosage remain significant after correction for multiple testing. Recent work has suggested a potential for bias in sex ratio driven by the male germline in Mus musculus (Conway et al. 1994; Machol\u00e1n et al. 2008; Cocquet et al. 2009; Ellis et al. 2011; Cocquet et al. 2012; Turner et al. 2012; Larson et al. 2016) , particularly in intersubspecific hybrids that are mismatched for copy number of Xand Y-linked genes expressed in postmeiotic spermatids. Although there are no previous observations that suggest a bias in sex ratio in the CC or its founders, it remains an important characteristic to measure in a study on reproductive productivity.\n\nTo estimate heritable effects on liter size and sex ratio we extended the original BayesDiallel model of Lenarcic et al. (2012) in two new ways. First, to better understand and distinguish the effects arising from female and male parents, we reparameterized our strain-specific additive and parental-sex effects such that we could provide estimates of maternal strain and paternal strain effects separately. In the original BayesDiallel model, maternal and paternal strain effects are split into \"additive\" effects, which consolidates the effects they have in common, and \"parental sex\", which models any remaining deviation between the two. Recognizing that additive effects from the sire are essentially wiped out by the additive effects, we instead collapsed the additive and parental-sex effects into \"dam.strain\" and \"sire.strain\" effects in a post-processing step on the posterior output. This allowed us to run the original BayesDiallel model while also viewing our data from the perspective of dam strain and sire strain contributions.\n\nSecond, we reimplemented the original MCMC sampler, designed for modeling a continuous outcome variable, in a general package MCMCglmm (Hadfield 2010 ) in order to model count and binary responses. Litter size, as measured, is most naturally distributed as Poisson, with zero-truncation owing to the fact that only successful litters were recorded. Sex ratio is most naturally modeled as a binomial, with an underlying (male) proportion between 0 and 1. Although it would be possible to obtain an approximate analysis by transformations to normality using the original BayesDiallel (and we do this for litter size for some otherwise hard-to-obtain quantities), we found such approximations to be inadequate for reliable estimation of higher order effects in the case of litter size and deeply flawed in the case of sex ratio.\n\nAlthough there is a computational cost, and added complexity to determining variance contributions, this new implementation achieves several objectives: 1) we no longer break the assumptions in the original model regarding normally distributed errors; 2) we easily accommodate overdispersion in our data; and 3) we can select from a large number of GLMMs ones that more closely resemble the forms of our data observations. In addition, we believe this flexibility will be appealing to many other researchers who would like to model non-Gaussian distributed phenotypes using diallel designs, and we have provided the code in an R package litterDiallel (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1435829).\n\nOverall, these results have implications for other avenues of future research. Future multiparental research populations should test for strain incompatibilities, reproductive phenotyping, and other health traits in a full diallel before the recombinant inbreeding begins (Odet et al. 2015) . These future research populations should also use non-related wild-derived individuals from the same subspecific origin in order to increase genetic diversity without introducing hybrid incompatibilities.\n\nThis work was supported in part by the following grants from the National Institutes of Health:\n\nP50GM076468, P50HG006582/P50MH090338, R01HD065024 (FP-MV), T32HD040127 (JRS), T32AI007419 (PLM), R01GM104125 (PLM), and R35GM127000 (WV).

This type of regression is explicit in its framework accounting for discrete observations, flexible in its ability to use linear mixed models on the latent scale, and allows for parameterization of excess variance observed, in a way that standard Poisson regression does not. We account for the zero depletion in our data by using ZTP regression instead of standard Poisson regression, since we exclude observations of birth cohorts where no pups survived to weaning.\n\nIn Figure 4 , the distribution of the observed data (litter size) is displayed for the WSB\u21e5WSB inbred mating, along with simulated data from a zero-truncated Poisson distribution based on the data mean.

In order to account for heteroscedasticity (unequal variance) of the model residuals that arises from the approximately ZTPoisson nature of the data, we use a variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) (Yu 2009 ) and run BayesDiallel again (Gaussian) to obtain Variance Projections on the modeled data. The VarPs that are calculated from these parameter estimates are an approximation of the variance contributions that we would observe in the GLMM BayesDiallel model.\n\nWe model the male pup counts and female pup counts jointly, using the BayesDiallel linear model, formulated for binomial GLMM regression. This model directly considers genetic effects on the imbalance in male vs. female pups by parameterizing the number of males and number of total pups (or the total, and the fraction of males in the total). The model is elaborated in the methods section of the main manuscript.\n\nThe proportion of weaned pups that are male, or equivalently, the proportion of weaned pups that are female, is approximated by a binomial distribution. In our data, the mean and the variance of male ratio are 0.494 and 0.063, respectively.\n\nTo generate the upper and lower 95% boundaries, as shown in Figure S6 , for the expected phenotype under the null hypothesis of male pup proportion = 0.5, we used the qbinom function in the stats package in R.\n\nVolume X October 2018 | Fertility in a CC founder diallel cross | 11\n\nAll rights reserved.
