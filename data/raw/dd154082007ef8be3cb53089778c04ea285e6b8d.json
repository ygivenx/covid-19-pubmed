{"title": "Clinical Infectious Diseases Malaria Coinfections in Febrile Pediatric Inpatients: A Hospital-Based Study From Ghana", "body": "In recent years, studies on causes of nonmalarial fever (NMF) in developing countries revealed a broad spectrum of potentially causative pathogens [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Many of these studies were conducted in the East African region, where a substantial drop in malaria prevalence could be observed [6] . Instead, acute respiratory tract infections of viral origin have been identified as one of the main causes of fever in pediatric outpatients [2] . However, such a remarkable decrease of malaria incidences has never been reported in Western and Central African regions, where Plasmodium falciparum infections are still frequent [7] .\n\nIn these holoendemic regions, children with repeated P. falciparum infection acquire semi-immunity early in life, leading to asymptomatic parasitemia episodes [8] .\n\nA child presenting with a febrile illness requiring hospitalization will most likely be tested for malaria with a rapid diagnostic test and, if parasites are present, treated with antimalarials, often in combination with antibiotics [9] . However, in settings with limited laboratory facilities, the real cause of a febrile illness with concomitant parasitemia is difficult to identify, especially in NMF with symptoms similar to malaria such as in bacterial or viral infections [10, 11] .\n\nA recent study at the household level, addressing the underestimation of NMF in African children, found that a majority of febrile illness is caused by pathogens other than P. falciparum malaria, even in areas where malaria is highly endemic [12] . Nevertheless, when coinfections do occur, interactions between Plasmodium parasites and other pathogens have been described, leading to a more severe course of disease and an increased mortality [13] [14] [15] . While most studies focus on NMF alone [4, 5, 16] or either investigate bacterial [1, 15, 17] or viral coinfections [18] , to our knowledge no study has yet looked at the whole spectrum of fever M A J O R A R T I C L E \u00a9 The Author(s) 2018.

Knowledge on the local epidemiological situation is crucial for clinicians working with limited resources to manage febrile patients as well as to help public health professionals to develop guidelines on targeted antibiotic treatment in times of expanding antimicrobial drug resistance.\n\nThe present study was conducted in hospitalized febrile children from rural Ghana to (1) describe clinical diagnoses, (2) calculate the frequency of potential pathogens, (3) and determine the burden of malaria coinfections and their association with parasite densities. Furthermore, a control group was recruited to assess malaria parasite densities in healthy, afebrile children from the community.\n\nThe study was conducted at the pediatric ward of the Agogo Presbyterian Hospital (APH), a district hospital with 250 beds, situated in the Asante Akim North municipality in Ghana. The municipal area has an estimated population of 140 694 inhabitants, spread over an area of 1160 km 2 (2010 Census Data, Ghana Statistical Service). The region has a tropical climate and is mainly covered by secondary rain forest and cultivated land. Malaria is highly endemic in that area with seasonal peaks [20, 21] .\n\nChildren \u226530 days and \u226415 years of age with a tympanic temperature \u226538\u00b0C admitted to the pediatric ward were recruited between November 2013 and April 2015. Repeated visits of participants were considered as new visits if they were at least 30 days apart or in case children were diagnosed with a new disease.\n\nBetween September 2014 and September 2015, healthy children <15 years of age with a tympanic temperature <37.5\u00b0C and without signs of infection were recruited at vaccination clinics in the surroundings of the APH. Venous blood samples were drawn for malaria microscopy, performed as described in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.\n\nAfter a physical examination by a pediatrician, 2-5 mL full blood, serum, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood were collected. A urine sample was obtained from each child. Nasopharyngeal flocked swabs (Copan FLOQSwabs, Copan Diagnostics) were taken from all children with signs of a lower respiratory tract infection. Children with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections and indistinct lung auscultation findings received a chest radiograph. A stool sample was collected from children presenting with diarrhea and cerebrospinal fluid samples were obtained from all children with meningeal signs or with clinical suspicion of meningoencephalitis (Supplementary Table 2 ). All samples were collected before drug administration and the medical treatment followed national and hospital guidelines. The diagnostic methods for each specimen and the clinical case definitions are described in the Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 2 .\n\nDescriptive statistics were applied to summarize patient data. Categorical variables were displayed with percentages, and continuous data with the median and interquartile range (IQR). Patient diagnoses were presented stratified by age or malaria parasitemia manifestation. Data analysis was performed with Stata version 14 software (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). Details of the statistical data analysis can be found in the Supplementary Statistical Analysis Plan.\n\nThe Committee on Human Research, Publications and Ethics, School of Medical Science, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana, and the Ethics Committee of the \u00c4rztekammer Hamburg, Germany, approved the study design and the informed consent procedures in the underlying studies. All participants were informed about the study's purpose and procedures. In older children, written informed consent was obtained from the patients and their parents or, in case of infants, the parents or legal guardian provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. these, 1238 (30%) fulfilled the study inclusion criteria and were recruited to the study. Median age of recruited children was 2 years (IQR, 1-4 years). A total of 561 (45%) patients were female and the median tympanic temperature was 39.0\u00b0C (IQR, 38.5\u00b0C-39.6\u00b0C) ( Table 1) . Of all children included in the study, 1078 attended the hospital once, 66 twice, 8 three times, and 1 four times during the study period.\n\nInfection with malaria parasites was found microscopically in 728 patients (59%). Of these, 679 (93%) were P. falciparum monoinfections and 41 (6%) were mixed infections (Table 2 and  Supplementary Table 3 ). Parasite densities varied greatly, with a median count of 74 385/\u00b5L (IQR, 25 508-201 407/\u00b5L) ( Table 2) .\n\nA total of 117 (16%) children with parasitemia were diagnosed as severe malaria [22] , of which 17 (15%) were classified as cerebral malaria (Supplementary Table 2 LRTIs and, in particular, pneumonia were less frequently diagnosed with increasing parasite counts (Figure 3 ).\n\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs) were diagnosed in 218 (18%) patients. With 27% (n = 77/285), the proportion of UTI was highest in children >4 years (Figure 2) , in contrast to only 15% (n = 141/953) in children <4 years. UTI was more common in girls (n = 150/561 [27%]) than in boys (n = 68/677 [10%]). Pathogens were identified in 32 (15%) children with UTI, most frequently E. coli (n = 25 [78%]) ( Table 2) . Plasmodium coinfections in UTI cases occurred independently of parasitemia (RR, 1.0; 95% CI, .8-1.3) (Figure 3 ).\n\nGastrointestinal infections were detected in 210 (17%) children. Most affected were children aged <1 year (n = 73/213 [34%]), and the frequency decreased with increasing age (Figure 2 ). Pathogens were found in 97 (45%) patients, with rotavirus being the most frequently detected pathogen (n = 32 [33%]) ( Table 2 ).\n\nThe proportion of gastrointestinal infections was highest in children without malaria parasitemia (n = 110/510 [22%]); however, no clear statistical difference was observed (RR, .8; 95% CI, .7-1.1) (Figure 3 ).\n\nBacterial bloodstream infections were found in 62 (5%) children, of whom 43 (69%) exhibited systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The proportion of bloodstream infections increased with age and was highest in the age group >4 years (n = 17/285 [6%]) ( Figure 2 ). Most common blood isolates were nontyphoidal Salmonella (n = 28/62 [45%]) and Salmonella Typhi (n = 19/62 [31%]) ( Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1 ). (Figure 3 ). The stratified analysis showed similar patterns among the established age groups (Figure 3 ).\n\nCentral nervous system (CNS) infection/meningitis was observed in 11 (1%) study children across all age groups ( Figure 2 ). In 3 (27%) cerebrospinal fluid samples, pathogens were identified (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 1) . No known meningitis/encephalitis-linked viruses were detected by next-generation sequencing. Low numbers of CNS infection/ meningitis patients did not allow any conclusions on associations with parasitemia ( Figure 2 ).\n\nSystemic viral infections were observed in 58 (5%) patients, predominantly in children >2 years of age (n = 47 [6%]) ( Table 2  and Supplementary Table 1 In 109 (9%) of study participants, the etiological cause of the febrile illness remained unidentified (Table 2) .\n\nIn total, 564 healthy children with a median age of 1 year (IQR, 0-3 years) were recruited between September 2014 and September 2015 in the study catchment area of the hospital (Table 3 ). In 87 (15%) participants, malaria parasites, predominantly P. falciparum (n = 82 [94%]), were detected. Median parasite count was 1696/\u00b5L (IQR, 416-6360/\u00b5L), ranging from 48 to 82 520 parasites/\u00b5L.\n\nPatients with high parasitemia have a lower likelihood for the additional diagnoses LRTI, pneumonia, and bloodstream infection ( Figure 3) . Hence, Plasmodium coinfections were observed more frequently in patients with low parasitemia. Figure 4 shows the cumulative proportions of parasitemic children along increasing parasite counts for fever-free controls, children with both parasitemia and an alternative diagnosis and those with Plasmodium monoinfection. In children with Plasmodium coinfections, 17% (n = 60/356) and, in those with Plasmodium monoinfection, only 12% (n = 45/372) had a parasite count <10 000/\u00b5L. At the parasite level of 100 000/ \u00b5L, 100% of the fever-free controls, 64% (n = 226/356) of the coinfected patients, and 54% (n = 192/372) of the monoinfected children had a parasitemia below that value. Thus, children with Plasmodium monoinfection had higher parasite counts compared with coinfected patients.\n\nUsing an extensive diagnostic panel, a clinical-microbiological diagnosis was made in 91% of hospitalized children with severe febrile illness. This is in line with findings from East Africa where a similar study in pediatric outpatients was able to identify possible causes of fever in 97% of children [2] . Despite reports on decreasing malaria incidences from several sub-Saharan countries [7] , the frequency of P. falciparum infections was still high and was found in more than half of the febrile children. Accordingly, a high number of patients belonged to 1 of 2 groups that are difficult to differentiate: (1) those with a nonmalarial disease and an asymptomatic Plasmodium parasitemia, and (2) those with a comorbidity of malaria and a nonmalarial disease.\n\nMarkedly, in the present study the likelihood of distinct nonmalarial diseases was dependent on parasite densities among coinfected patients. The frequency of respiratory tract and bloodstream infections was highest in children without malaria parasites and decreased with increasing parasite counts. In contrast, higher parasite counts were detected in children without nonmalarial comorbidity. This mutual exclusion of high parasitemia and other fever causes might be due to a selection bias (Berkson bias) where, within clinical settings, children with a severe nonmalarial disease (eg, bloodstream infection, pneumonia) have a reduced likelihood of another severe concomitant febrile infection being the reason for their fever symptoms and hence the hospital admission [23] . As outlined above, 11% of patients without parasitemia had a bacterial bloodstream infection, while this was only diagnosed in 1% of patients with a parasite count >10 000/\u00b5L. Therefore, the determination of the patients' parasite densities is essential for the recognition of a nonmalarial disease in healthcare facilities within malaria-holoendemic areas. This information, however, is not provided by the immunochromatographic rapid test available today but rather by gold-standard malaria microscopy if performed by well-trained staff. For now, in-depth investigations for other pathogens should be initiated in case of discrepancies between disease severity and parasite count. Nevertheless, it has to be emphasized that all critically ill children with parasitemia must receive immediate antimalarial treatment, regardless of parasite counts.\n\nTo attribute severe febrile disease with P. falciparum infection to malaria, different parasite density cutoffs have been . Cumulative proportions of parasitemic children along increasing parasite counts for fever-free control group, children with both parasitemia and an alternative diagnosis (coinfection), and those with parasitemia only (monoinfection). In children with Plasmodium coinfection, 17% (n = 60/356) and, in those with Plasmodium monoinfection, only 12% (n = 45/372) had a parasite count <10 000/\u00b5L. At the parasite level of 100 000/\u00b5L, 100% of the fever-free controls, 64% (n = 226/356) of the coinfected patients, and 54% (n = 192/372) of the monoinfected children had a parasitemia below that value. proposed or applied, most of them ranging between 5000 and 10 000 parasites/\u00b5L [24] . In the present study, 15% of healthy but parasitemic children had a parasite count >10 000/\u00b5L, demonstrating that a parasite density cutoff has a weak specificity and should be adapted to the purpose (eg, patient management or clinical trial case definition). Furthermore, local malaria endemicity and age distribution has to be taken into account when deciding on a diagnostic parasite density cutoff. The crucial factor is the likelihood of asymptomatic parasitemia that is dependent on the grade of semi-immunity in a specific population [8] . Consequently, local endemicity is an essential information for the malaria diagnosis and should be thoroughly assessed. Acute lower respiratory tract infections were one of the most common reasons for hospitalization in the study area, which has also been reported for children <5 years worldwide [19] . The bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae was diagnosed in half of the children with LRTI despite the introduction of a pneumococcal vaccine in 2012 in Ghana. Although the pathogen may colonize the respiratory tract as a commensal, its presence as a risk factor for severe disease in viral coinfections has been demonstrated before [25] .\n\nRotavirus and Giardia lamblia were the most common enteric pathogens in this study. Despite the introduction of a monovalent vaccine in Ghana in May 2012, the high frequency of rotavirus in children with acute diarrhea in this study may hint toward reduced vaccine effectiveness due to high rotavirus diversity in this region [26] . The clinical relevance of G. lamblia infections has been questioned in large case-control studies [27, 28] . Similar to respiratory pathogens, it is a challenge to distinguish between intestinal carriage and true gastrointestinal infections [29] .\n\nSalmonella disease is the major cause of invasive bacterial febrile illness in children in sub-Saharan Africa and known to be associated with P. falciparum malaria [15, 23] . Even though in this present study, parasitemia-bacteremia coinfections are rare, they are mainly caused by nontyphoidal salmonellae.\n\nThis study is limited by the fact that the healthy control cohort was seen only once during their vaccination visit and that follow-up visits were not performed due to logistical reasons. However, a clinical examination and a medical anamnesis (data not included) provided robust insights into the current health status and we believe the selected controls were disease free. Furthermore, the healthy control group could not be used to associate other pathogens with disease symptoms. As paired sera were not available, the detection of Brucella species, Leptospira species, Borrelia species, Rickettsia species, Coxiella burnetii, and Bartonella species was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instead of the gold-standard serological methods. The frequency of these zoonotic infections may be therefore underestimated. Furthermore, no PCR methods were used to detect and quantify submicroscopic parasitemias, which may lead to an underestimation of P. falciparum infections.\n\nOur study highlights P. falciparum as a major pathogen found in severely ill children admitted to a hospital in Ghana. The likelihood of comorbidity with a nonmalarial disease is dependent on the level of malaria parasites in the blood. Hence, parasite densities provide important information for patient management, in particular for antimicrobial medication. Currently available rapid malaria tests might not be sufficient for this decision, and semiquantitative rapid tests of malarial parasitemia are required as long as reliable microscopic malaria diagnosis and extensive diagnostics of nonmalarial causes of pediatric febrile illness are not available in resource-poor settings."}
