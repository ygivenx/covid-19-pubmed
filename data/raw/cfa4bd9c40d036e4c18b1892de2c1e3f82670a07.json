{"title": "Archives of Virology. Replication of Porcine Enteric Adenoviruses in vivo", "body": "Although adenoviruses were first associated with diarrhea in pigs in 1964 (13) subsequent attempts to reproduce enteritis experimentally have been unsuccessfnl (9, 14, 15, 23) . Hence it has been concluded that adenoviruses arc of relatively low pathogenicity for the porcine gastro-intestinal tract (9) . Nevertheless adenoviruses are frequently observed in pig fecal material by electron microscopy (4) .\n\nIt has been shown recently that enteritis can be reproduced consistently in hysterotomy-derived, colostrum-deprived (HDCD) piglets that are infected oronasally with a strain of porcine adenovirus type 3 (7) . The lesions are characteristic of an acute viral enteric infection. Similar lesions have been observed in naturally infected two to three week old piglets from field outbreaks of the disease (7) . The virus only infects the columnar epithelial cells, unlike enteritic bovine adenovirus which also infects capillary endothelial cells (6) . Intranuclear Cowdry type A inclusions have been observed in the enterocytes of the lower small intestine by light microscopy (7) . l~. DUCATELLE, W. COUSSEh~ENT, and J. HOO~ENS: This work has now been extended to examine the mode of virus replication in the columnar epithelial ceils of experimentally and naturally infected piglets by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and by immunoperoxidase (Ip) staining of paraffin sections.\n\nPorcine adenovirus serotype 3 strain 6618, obtained from Dr. Derbyshire (University of Guelph, Guelph, Canada), was grown in primary porcine kidney cells, maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium with four per cent fetal calf serum. The second passage was harvested and used as the inoculum.\n\nHDCD piglets were kept in isolation in Horsfall units. On the second day of life 12 animals were infected oronasalty with 4 ml virus suspension (titre 10 a.~ TCID~o). Two piglets were kept as controls. AnimMs were killed 3 to 120 days after infection. The sequential pathology of the lesions is described elsewhere (7) .\n\nTwo piglets from field outbreaks of diarrhea in two breeding herds were autopsied. Samples from one of these animals were found negative for other infectious agents. The other was only examined morphologicMly. Adenovii~ses were demonstrated in the enterocytes of both animals by TEM: and by Ip staining, but the virus was not isolated.\n\nIn both the experimental and the naturally infected animals, histological examination of the intestine indicated that the terminal part of the jejunum and the ileum had the most prominent and consistent lesions (7) . Therefore, specimens from these regions were taken from TEM and Ip labelling.\n\nSpecimens were fixed, dehydrated and embedded in Spurr's resin as previously described (t0).. Semi-thin and ultra-thin sections were cut and stained as described (10). The ultrathin sections were examined in a Zeiss EM 9 S 2 electron microscope.\n\nAn unlabelled antibody-enzyme technique was used (9) . Four l,m sections from formalin fixed and paraffin embedded specimens were rehydrated and incubated with the following sera at 22 \u00b0 C:\n\n1. Normal goat serum for 20 minutes. 2. Specific anti-porcine adenovirus strain 6618 serum for 2 hours at a 1/200 dilution or overnight at a 1/800 dilution.\n\nThe serum was raised in rabbits by giving 5 fortnightly injections of 105 TCIDs0 of the virus. Serum was collected one week after the last injection.\n\n3. Goat anti-rabbit globulin serum (purchased from Pasture, Brussels, Belgium) was used at a 1/20 dilution for 20 minutes. 4. A eommerciM peroxidase antiperoxidase complex (9) was diluted 1/300 and incubated for 20 minutes.\n\nBetween each incubation the sections were rinsed for 5 minutes on a shaker plat,form with Tris buffered saline. They were subsequently stained for 7 minutes in a solution of 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB), 25 mg of DAB and 0.04 ml of 30 per cent IK2Oz in 200 ml of Tris buffered sMine. Sections from uninfected control animals were included in the procedure. Adjacent sections were stained to show endogenous peroxidase activity. When necessary, Ip stained sections were eounterstained with haematoxylin and eosin.\n\nUltrastructurM observations on the small intestine of control piglets revealed a normal mncosa with high columnar absorptive epithelial cells and goblet, cells.\n\nSimilar ultrastruetural changes were observed in the intestines of naturally and experimentally infected pigs. A number of enterocytes containing viral particles were observed in the jejunum and ileum (Fig. 1) . In addition epithelial cells were seen which did not contain viral particles, but showed ultrastructural alterations which were considered to be vitally mediated. These cells were characterized by large irregular intranuelear patches of fairly low electron density. They were composed of fine granules and fibrils which contrasted with the nuclear chromatin by their fine granularity. They sometimes formed a ring with a diameter of up to 3.5 Bm (Fig. 2) . These structures were designated type I I intranuclear inclusions.\n\nVirus partieles were confined mostly to the nucleus. When the nucleus contained only a few viral particles, they tended to be distributed towards the nuclear membrane, the central nuclear region being occupied by type I I inclusions. When the nucleus contained many viral particles, as shown in Fig. 3 , they tended to be located in closely packed groups in the centre of the nucleus where they formed paraerystalline arrays. These arrays were sometimes very large and composed of virions with a centre-to-centre spacing of 80 nm. Type I I inclusions were found between the arrays. Small spherical inclusions, approximately 0.5 to 1 ~zm in diameter, were also present. They consisted of a fine granular electron dense matrix (Fig. 3) and were mainly located at the boundary of the central nuclear region. They were designated type I inclusions. In addition, small, granular, highly electron dense inclusions were seen in close apposition to the paracrystalline arrays. These were termed type IV inclusions (Fig. 3) . Inclusions were not usually observed at the periphery-of highly infected nuclei. This zone was electron translucent containing only dispersed fine granular material and many viral particles. The latter were randomly distributed in this area. Rough granulo-fibrillar material, resembling ehromatin, was observed adhering to the nuclear envelope. In these infected cells the nucleolus was also usually located at the periphery of the nucleus. Both in the peripheral area and in the central part of these heavily infected nuclei, tubular structures ~dth a diameter of approximately 90 nm were occasionally seen (Fig. 4) . They had a thin moderately electron dense coat surrounding an inner highly electron dense tubule which was filled with fine granular material. The lenght of these tubules varied greatly. They were always observed in close association with type I I inclusions and with viral particles. The viral particles were of two types. The first had an electron dense core measuring approximately 50 nm surrounded by an outer eapsid. The second had a moderately electron dense core bounded by an inner electron dense shell which was separated from the capsid by a narrow clear space (Fig. 5) . The virions had an overall diameter of 65 nm. Empty particles with only a capsid shell were occasionally seen. Virions were found in the vicinity of type I I inclusions close to crescentlike structures which seemed to derive from the granulo-fibrillar material of the inclusion (Fig. 5) .\n\nIn some heavily infected cells, a few viral particles were also observed in the cytoplasm. They were located between the lamellae of the endoplasmic retieulum and in small vacuoles in the apicM cell cytoplasm.\n\nVirus release seemed to occur after rupture of the nucleus and the apical celt membrane. \n\nSections of intestine from control piglets were negative on Ip staining. This technique revealed a difference between the experimentally infected animals and the field cases; in the latter, infected intestinal epithelial cells were more weakly stained. Therefore, the description given here will refer mainly to the experimental animals.\n\nIp positive cells were only found in the epithelium of the villi. Positive cells were occasionally found ill the crypts but the majority were found higher up the villi. In a number of cells staining was restricted to the supranuclear cytoplasmic zone. ttowever, most positive cells were stained throughout their cytoplasm. This cytoplasmic staining had a fibrillar arrangement (t~ig. 6). The intraeytoptasmic loealisation of the stain was confirmed by counterstaining Ip labelled sections with H. & E. and by comparing the relationship of infected to non-infected cells at the ultrastruetural level (Fig. I) . In some cells with a positive Ip cytoplasmic stain, the nucleus was faintly stained (Fig. 6) . A patchy nuclear staining pattern was observed in other cells but, on the whole, nuclei showed intense uniform staining.\n\nIn the Ip stained sections it was never possible to recognize the peripheral clear nuclear halo seen in H. & E. stained sections of irffected tissue cultures (7) . The different stages of Ip staining described above could often be seen in neighbouring cells on the same villus. \n\nAdenovirus replication has been studied mainly in tissue culture (1, 2, 3). Porcine adenovirus replication has been investigated in tissue culture by histo-logieM (8) , immunofluoreseenee (16, 20, 2t) and TEM (8, 17) techniques. This is the first in vivo study of the replication of a porcine adenovirus. The first ultrastructural change observed in the enterocytes of infected pigs was the appearance of type I I intranuelear inclusion bodies. The nomenelature used for the different ultrastruetural intranuclear inclusion bodies in the literature is confusing. The one used here is comparable to that used for human adenovirus intranuelear inclusion bodies in tissue culture (18, 26) . The ring formation of the type I I inclusion has also been observed in tissue cultures infected with equine adenovirus (22) . Type I I I inclusion bodies (18) were not observed in the present, study. Type I inclusions were frequently seen, but were never found in the absense of viral particles and type IV inclusions were observed in close association with paraerystalline arrays of viruses. The parallel fibre inclusions described in bovine adenovirus (3, 24) and in human adenovirus t2 infected cell cultures (18) were not observed.\n\nRectilinear profiles have been described in tissue culture cells infected with porcine adenoviruses (8, 17) but were not seen in our i% vivo infected material, however, the tubular structures described above may bear some resemblance to these rectilinear profiles. The budding of viral particles from rectilinear profiles has been described (17) but our tubular structures do not appear to be involved in a similar process. The tubular structures in the present material were quite similar to those seen in cell cultures infected with fowl adenoviruses (1).\n\nHistologieM investigations of cell cultures infected with ea.nine adenovirus have shown a halo around the periphery of infected nuclei and this has been attributed to ehromatin margination (19) . Similar nuclear chromatin margination and the formation of a peripheral electron lucent zone were observed in the present, material. Viral particles, both in the central and peripheral regions of infected nuclei, were of two types. Two types of viral particles have also been observed in bovine adenovirus infected cell cultures (2) and in experimental enteric adenovirus infection of mice (25) , whereas in pig kidney cell cultures infected with porcine adenovirus strain 25R three types of viral particles have been described (17) .\n\nThe appearance of crescent-shaped structures at the margin of type II inclusions have to our knowledge not been described before. They may represent the assembly of the viral particles. The initial appearance of viruses in the vicinity of type II inclusions has been described for pig adenovirus strMn 25R (17) and for bovine adenovirus (5) replicating in cell cultures.\n\nThe intranuelear distribution of -viral antigen as demonstrated by the Ip technique is comparable to immunofluorescenee studies on porcine (16, 20, 21) and other adenoviruses (1, 2) in cell cultures and on mouse adenovirus in vivo (20) . The patchy distribution probably corresponds to type I and II inclusions. Studies on cultured cells infected with human adenovirus have shown that these inclusions contain viral protein (15) . The strong Ip positive reaction in the cytoplasm may be due to the production of excess viral protein, as has been suggested for adenoviruses in cell cultures (12) ."}
