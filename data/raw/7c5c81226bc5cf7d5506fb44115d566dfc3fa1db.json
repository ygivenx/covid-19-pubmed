{"title": "Supplementary Information 5: Evidence Narratives for Additional Canine Infections Vector-borne agents", "body": "controlled studies to investigate the relationship between IMHA and Borrelia infection may be warranted.\n\nThree studies were identified and evaluated. [5] [6] [7] One prospective case-control study asking if D.\n\nimmitis infection was associated with IMHA demonstrated that dogs with heartworm disease were significantly more likely than heartworm-negative dogs to be anemic and Coombs'positive. 7 However, anemia in heartworm-positive dogs was not correlated with a positive Coombs' test result. Whether the lack of correlation was because there is more than one mechanism for anemia in heartworm-infected dogs or because binding of IgG, IgM or complement to erythrocytes did not contribute to anemia could not be determined. Owing to the way data were summarized, the specific number of dogs with IMHA could not be determined; an IME value could not be assigned. The IME values for the other studies, which each mentioned D. immitis infection in a dog with IMHA, were 1.95 and 2.37 respectively. 5, 6 Consensus Summary Statement: The overall evidence that Dirofilaria immitis infection can induce IMHA is low. Further investigation into whether D. immitis causes IMHA is warranted.\n\nFour studies had IME values assigned. [8] [9] [10] [11] A total of 6 dogs with IMHA exposed to 12, 13 Coombs'-positive anemia was described in a dog with T cell lymphoproliferative disease also infected with a novel hemotropic Mycoplasma. 14 Owing to the presence of an additional comorbidity, an IME value could not be assigned. Only one study designed to ask specifically whether IMHA is associated with natural hemotropic Mycoplasma infection in dogs was identified. In that study based in the United Kingdom, the blood of 227 anemic and non-anemic dogs, including that from 37 dogs with IMHA, was tested using PCR targeting Ca. M. haemotoparvum. No dog, with or without anemia or IMHA, tested positive, suggesting that this Mycoplasma sp. is not a common cause of infection in that region; therefore, no conclusions regarding the role of Mycoplasma infection as a trigger for IMHA in dogs could be made. 15\n\nThe evidence for hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. causing IMHA in dogs is low. Further study is required to determine whether Mycoplasma spp. can contribute to the pathogenesis of IMHA alone, in immune-compromised patients, or during co-infection with other agents, and whether there are species differences in pathogenicity that impact the development of IMHA.\n\nAnemia and positive Coombs' test results are both common in dogs with leishmaniosis.\n\nIn a study by Ciaramella et al, 5 of 25 dogs with leishmaniosis were Coombs'-positive. 16 Anemia was also common; however, the number of dogs with both a Coombs'-positive anemia and leishmaniasis could not be discerned from the way the data were reported, precluding the assignment of an IME value. One additional study identified IMHA in 2 dogs with leishmaniasis without other comorbidities, yielding an IME value of 1.87. 11\n\nConsensus Summary Statement: The overall evidence that Leishmania spp. induce IMHA is negligible to low. Given the inflammatory nature of this disease and the potential association with IMHA, further controlled studies are warranted.\n\nNeospora caninum Neospora caninum infections have been detected in a dog with IMHA treated with immunosuppressive drugs for 2.5 weeks 17 and in a dog with IMHA plus immune-mediated thrombocytopenia immunosuppressed for 4 weeks. 18 Both dogs were suspected to have subclinical neosporosis, with latent parasites reactivated after immunosuppression. One dog was concurrently diagnosed with a Klebsiella pneumonia urinary tract infection; 17 an IME value could not be assigned. The IME value for the other study was 2.97. 18 Consensus Summary Statement: The evidence for Neospora caninum inducing IMHA is negligible. However, the role for subclinical neosporosis in canine IMHA cannot be ruled out.\n\nAncylostoma caninum A retrospective case series described 3 cases of IMHA in dogs that were infected with A.\n\ncaninum. 19 IMHA resolved in all 3 dogs when treated concurrently with fenbendazole and a 4\n\nweek tapering course of prednisone. A. caninum was considered a possible causative agent for IMHA in this report, based on the lack of other identified trigger factors in these dogs.\n\nAdditionally, IMHA in each dog resolved after antiparasitic treatment in addition to a relatively short immunosuppressive treatment period. The IME value for this study was 4.13.\n\nThe evidence for Ancylostoma caninum inducing IMHA is low. However, evidence is currently limited to only a single case series in which IMHA in each of 3 dogs resolved after anti-parasitic treatment in addition to a relatively short course of immunosuppressive treatment. A. caninum is a possible causative agent for canine IMHA, but further studies are needed to confirm the pathogenic nature of this agent or other gastrointestinal parasites in IMHA.\n\nParvovirus B19, an erythrovirus, has been associated with IMHA in people. 20, 21 One study by Jackson et al was evaluated. 22 This study was classified as a retrospective case series.\n\nOf 55 dogs with IMHA, 1 dog was identified as having canine parvovirus, yielding an IME value of 2.33.\n\nwidely investigated in dogs. Given the lack of relevant studies, the role of any virus in canine IMHA cannot be ruled out. Further studies to determine whether viral exposure in dogs induces IMHA in dogs may be warranted.\n\nThree separate retrospective studies describe 4 dogs diagnosed with endocarditis and IMHA. 15, 22, 23 . Treatment was not described in these reports; therefore, it is difficult to identify the causative nature of endocarditis in IMHA pathogenesis. The median IME value was 1.95, with a range of 1.87-2.33.\n\nLocal bacterial infections have also been reported in dogs with IMHA. Nineteen dogs with IMHA were described as having various localized bacterial infections. 8 \n\nOne retrospective case report described a dog with Mycoplasma cynos pneumonia diagnosed with IMHA. 30 While the dog had only marginal anemia (hematocrit of 0.37 L/L) and lacked evidence of hemolysis, cold agglutinins were detected, raising suspicion for a diagnosis of IMHA. Cold agglutinins are commonly detected in people with Mycoplasma pneumonia. 31, 32 The cold agglutinins were no longer detected after 8 weeks of enrofloxacin treatment for M. cynos, suggesting a role of M. cynos in the pathogenesis of their development. The dog was also treated with a beta-lactam antibiotic, which cannot be ruled out as the underlying cause of the cold agglutinins; an IME value could not be assigned.\n\nTwo dogs were reportedly treated for systemic bacterial infections originating in the respiratory tract 4 weeks prior to being diagnosed with IMHA. 24 One retrospective study specifically investigated whether bacteremia was associated with IMHA in dogs. 33 In that study, 12/12 dogs diagnosed with IMHA had negative aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures. However, the study performed cultures on only a small number of dogs and in general, blood culture is considered relatively insensitive for diagnosing bacteremia. 34, 35 The IME value for systemic infections inducing IMHA in these studies ranged from 0.00 33 to 4.20. 24 Sepsis with concurrent IMHA was reported in 3/93 (3.2%) dogs in one study, 10 yielding an IME value for sepsis of 1.87. Outcome information for these patients was not given, and there was no direct evidence for sepsis causing IMHA.\n\nThe evidence for Mycoplasma cynos inducing IMHA is low.\n\nBased on a single case report of cold agglutinin-positive anemia in a dog and the observation that Mycoplasma spp. cause cold agglutinins in other species, further studies are needed to determine whether Mycoplasma spp. cause IMHA in some dogs.\n\nTwo retrospective studies each documented 1 case of fungal infection in dogs with IMHA. In one report, the dog was diagnosed with Blastomyces dermatitidis, while in the second study the dog was reported to have systemic mycosis, but the agent was not specified. 10, 24 The IME values for these reports were respectively 4.04 and 1.70. The evidence for fungal infections causing IMHA is negligible to low, although neither of these studies was designed to identify a potential causal relationship. "}
