{"title": "", "body": "physicians and veterinarians receive pay for prescribing antimicrobials, and where physicians suspect that they may face lawsuits from their patients if they withhold antimicrobials. This situation resembles a form of entrapment-where physicians and veterinarians are incentivized to do socially harmful acts-such that it is unsurprising when they overprescribe antimicrobials to ensure their own financial stability.\n\nGiven that individual-level change appears insufficient to control the acceleration of AMR, action at the institutional level is needed.\n\nAMR is one example of an issue where compulsory regulations may accomplish what cannot be accomplished individually. Indeed, government broadly is one of the most important means through which individuals in society can come together and collectively act in ways that they cannot as individuals-and law is the primary mechanism through which government facilitates such collective actions.\n\nRedirecting the approach to AMR towards national-level action, as the World Health Organization (WHO) has done by encouraging countries to develop national action plans on AMR, represents progress. 10 However, only appealing to countries to take on the responsibility for acting on this issue-particularly low and middle-income countries-is also not appropriate. Expecting individual countries to bear the responsibility and costs of addressing AMR is unreasonable, when the international community is also set up in such a way that the efforts of individual countries acting alone will likely fail. Such failure stems from the reality that individual countries also face disincentives and constraints in acting on their own. A single country might invest its resources and take significant steps to mitigate AMR, yet that country's efforts can be easily undermined by a few resistant microbes tagging along on an international flight from one country to another country.\n\nIt is clear, therefore, that in order to make significant progress on AMR, concerted global efforts are needed beyond simply targeting individual people or individual countries. Collective problems require collective action; global collective problems require global collective action. As such, we cannot hold individuals or individual countries-particularly the poorest people and poorest countries in the world-responsible to act outside a broad global collaboration.\n\nAnd just as law is the primary mechanism through which society takes collective action within countries, international law is the primary mechanism through which global society can take collective action across countries-and as such, ought to be used to address global AMR. Despite its shortcomings, international law is the strongest mechanism existing today through which countries can make commitments to each other and coordinate their actions, including actions to address the problem of AMR. In the following sections, we explore the benefits and challenges of using the law, and particularly international law, to achieve the level of global collective action necessary to truly address AMR. \n\nTo simplify, law operates upon at least two different levels of jurisdiction: domestic and international. In order to understand the ways in which law can help to address the collective action problem of AMR, it is important to recognize these modes of operation. Domestic laws apply within one country or within subregions of a country.\n\nInternational law extends beyond country borders and applies globally to those states who have accepted its obligations. Legal options for addressing AMR are available at both levels of jurisdiction though, in fact, to be truly effective, legal action is needed at both levels.\n\nOn the domestic front, governments can intervene at each of the different stages of the antimicrobial value chain to optimize the use of antimicrobials within their jurisdictions. 11 For example, govern- Kong to Vancouver and then on to Toronto; the site of a secondary outbreak. In the future, similar disease outbreaks are expected to spread within similarly short periods of time, affecting many countries across various geographical regions very quickly. 14 While individual governments can be expected to take the lead in responding to outbreaks within their borders, greater coordination across countries will be needed to address threats to global public health. 15\n\nConsequently, a response beyond the domestic is required.\n\nGlobal action is clearly required to address the global problem of AMR. However, specific measures to maintain the effectiveness of antimicrobials and to increase the development of new antimicrobials and related products have not been pursued sufficiently or at scale. As such, it is our global governance structures that ought to be reformed to address AMR and its root social causes. The most sustainable and effective method to instigate such change is through an international legal agreement, whether it is called a convention, covenant, regulation, treaty, or any one of the other more than 30 names for it. 16 Current progress towards global collective action has already been made through existing international legal agreements. For example, the International Health Regulations require WHO member states to monitor and report disease outbreaks, and both the WHO and the World Organization for Animal Health have created international standards for antimicrobial surveillance programmes. 17 These global standards are helpful for encouraging a common approach to challenges, ensuring the comparability of information and minimizing the between-country differences, inequities, and market distortions that are barring significant global action at the moment.\n\nThe first step is to change global governance structures so that they address the root social causes of AMR. While AMR is usually considered a natural microbiological or medical challenge, the problem to humans is that we are accelerating microbial evolution through the currently established social contexts in which we live and use antimicrobial medicines, leading to the unnecessary abuse of this precious resource. Resistance itself will always occur, as it is a natural biological process-one that Sir Alexander Fleming high- In terms of global market failures, using the lens of political economy, there are some clear game-theoretic problems that make current government actions rational but that lead to suboptimal global collective actions overall. For example, the free-rider problem is often present when we are attempting to achieve greater innovation. The theory is that the free-rider problem occurs when people or countries can benefit from a public good or service without making a significant investment themselves. This ultimately results in a lack of provision of those products. 20 When a public good is available to all, and is costly to produce, rational actors will attempt to free-ride on the work of others. The economic assumption is that international standards that apply to all countries to invest in antimicrobial innovation and regulate the use of antimicrobials-albeit appropriately differentiated according to national circumstance-is the only cost-effective and sustainable way of solving this free-rider problem. 21 In the absence of such an international collective approach, it is difficult to convince any government to invest in antimicrobial innovation when each can simply wait for another country, \n\nAccess without conservation and innovation will speed resistance Innovation without access is unjust, and without conservation it's wasteful sure that everyone in the world has access to these lifesaving products might solve one aspect of the problem (i.e., access), but if such use is inappropriate, it would further speed and breed resistance, deepening the two other aspects of the problem (i.e., conservation and innovation).\n\nThere are also more traditional coordination challenges that an international legal agreement could help to address. Indeed, there are already numerous global strategies, political resolutions, regulatory standards, multilateral activities, industry initiatives, and pub- \n\nReform of the global governance mechanisms relevant to AMR is clearly needed. If time were not a challenge, one could consider a radical reimagining of the structure and mechanisms of global governance and a complete change to the system in order to ensure these kinds of collective action problems do not exist in the first place. However, given the urgent need to make progress in the short and medium term, the most pragmatic, effective, fair, and sustainable way forward is through a new international legal agreement. A growing number of scholars have been calling for such an agreement to address AMR. 25 An international legal agreement makes the most sense for at least four reasons. First, there is clear interdependence among countries when it comes to AMR, which means that all, or at least most, countries must act in order for any country to be safe.\n\nSecond, because interlocking action is needed on access, conservation, and innovation, a new international law can facilitate bargaining and tie together action on all three. Third, action on AMR is costly, such that each party must make the strongest commitment possible in order for the other parties to be prepared to do the same. Finally, the benefits of action on AMR are long term, which means that we require countries to lock in their commitment, and we need mechanisms to disincentivize deviation. This is especially important considering that the costs of conserving antimicrobials and promoting antimicrobial innovation are born in the short term.\n\nWhile we do not know the final shape an international legal agreement would take, at least 10 different provisions might be would be obliged to meet; for example, likely options for this type of provision seem to be to prohibit antimicrobial growth promotors, designate human-only classes of antimicrobials, and strengthen and coordinate surveillance systems.\n\nVarious implementation mechanisms could also be incorporated within an international legal agreement to implement these 10 pro- Achieving these kinds of international provisions and implementation mechanisms should not be politically impossible and could prove to be politically advantageous. For example, even farmers and industries that currently use antimicrobials as a prophylaxis and to promote growth in animals might support these actions if it meant that producers in one jurisdiction were not at a disadvantage compared with others. Indeed, while global standards might initially be seen by some as intrusive, they\n\ncan also be beneficial to industry by minimizing unfair differences and market distortions between countries. Global standards that ban the use of antimicrobials as growth promoters, for example, would ensure that all producers of animal products face the same regulatory requirements and constraints. Global standards would also ensure the social cost is internalized into all animal products and not just some of them. One could even imagine industry groups championing global standards as a way to prevent market disadvantages across countries;\n\nif these standards do not apply worldwide, farmers in one country will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage when competing with firms in other countries. Industry has extensive experience with global standards, and it is in the best interest of industry to ensure that, when standards come into force, all competitors are also subject to the same regulations. The typical industry opposition to national standards may\n\ngive way when such standards are globally applied.\n\nDespite its flaws, the law is the most effective means to address the root social causes of AMR, and international law is the most pragmatic, effective, fair, and sustainable way to manage the globally interconnected dimesnsions of AMR. While it is important to remain realistic-as progress takes time whenever a new international legal agreement is proposed-we currently stand at a unique moment that\n\ngives much reason to be optimistic and ambitious. Specifically, for decades, many individuals around the world have been advocating greater political action on AMR; voices that are only recently being heard. Due to these past efforts, a policy window has opened and there is now a unique opportunity to take bold action. The challenge we face is that issues like AMR garner significant attention but attention also tends to fall off just as quickly as another pressing issue takes its place. From an advocacy perspective, the goal should be to institutionalize and create as many permanent institutions as possible during the period when the policy window is open, in order to sustain action beyond that initial window of opportunity. To see progress in 10 years' time, we need to mobilize now to kickstart the negotiation of an international legal agreement-an institutionalized process that would keep attention on the challenge of AMR and result in an output that would tackle its root social causes for years to come.
