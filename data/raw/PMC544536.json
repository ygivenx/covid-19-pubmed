{"title": "Law as a Tool for Preventing Chronic Diseases: Expanding the Spectrum of Effective Public Health Strategies", "body": "This paper examines the potential need for and role of systematic legal\n    frameworks in preventing and mitigating chronic diseases. In part\n    1 of this 2-part series, we describe the role and use of laws, as well as\n    the demonstrated effectiveness of laws, in supporting selected public health\n    interventions. In part 2, we will provide an overview of U.S. jurisprudence\n    and legal methods relevant to  public health problems and outline potential contours of legal frameworks adaptable to chronic\n    disease prevention by offering examples from different public health\n    domains.\n\nThe terrorist attacks of fall 2001 and events since then, including the  epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),\n    have focused immense attention on public health legal preparedness and on\n    the role of law in assuring the public's health (1, 2). One prominent example\n    is a renewed interest in quarantine, including the adequacy of relevant \n    legal authorities and due process protections. In addition to the highly \n    visible legal aspects of such recent problems involving acute diseases, \n    seminal work is underway to provide options for strengthening laws essential \n    to public health infrastructure and public health practice (3). Other \n    commentators have examined the roles of specific legal processes, such as \n    litigation, and of legal frameworks as tools for addressing public health \n    problems (4, 5). \n\nEfforts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in\n    relation to the heightened interest in the role of law in public health\n    practice are centered in its own Public Health Law Program and in several\n    other CDC programs, including the National Center for Chronic Disease\n    Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP). These efforts broadly encompass\n    approaches to assist public health practitioners at all levels to improve\n    their understanding of the legal foundations of public health and to develop\n    their ability to use systematic legal frameworks and laws  for\n    achieving program goals and objectives. Achieving comprehensive public\n    health legal preparedness to address public health emergencies is an\n    important goal of this endeavor. Public health legal preparedness can be\n    defined as a public health system's attainment of specified legal benchmarks\n    or standards essential to the preparedness of the public health system. The\n    core elements of public health legal preparedness (Table 1) are relevant and\n    applicable to legal preparedness in other, non-acute domains of public\n    health, including chronic disease prevention (1).\n    \n\nIn addition to the prominent role laws have played in response to recent \n    public health emergencies, laws have contributed\n    significantly to many notable public health achievements (6, 7, 8). Examples of\n    such critical contributions include the landmark 1905 U.S. Supreme\n    Court decision, Jacobson v Massachusetts, which upheld the constitutionality\n    of compulsory immunization; federal requirements for fortification of foods;\n    the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974; warning notices on cigarette packs; and\n    seat belt laws (6, 9). Despite the historically important role for law in\n    public health and the rapidly growing number of publications on the subject,\n    conceptual frameworks for the application of law to public health have not\n    yet been fully explicated, and their benefits remain only partly realized.\n    With few exceptions, systematic legal frameworks have not been developed for\n    preventing chronic diseases and their major risk factors.\n\nAlthough the term \"legal framework\" is given further definition later in \n    this 2-part article, we use this term to broadly connote a conceptual \n    approach for addressing public health problems through logical and rational \n    combinations of legal dimensions \u2014 including but not limited to U.S. \n    jurisprudence, basic sources of U.S. law, legal theories, and legal \n    mechanisms and tools \u2014 which are appropriately tailored to a specific public \n    health problem. The term law as used here may take the form of \n    constitutional provisions, statutory enactments, regulations, ordinances, \n    government-initiated litigation, court rulings, or policies adopted by \n    public-sector bodies such as school and zoning boards. Law also includes \n    policies or treaties adopted by international bodies.\n\nTwo overarching goals of our national public health agenda are to\n    increase the quality and number of years of healthy life and to eliminate\n    health disparities (10). For chronic diseases, these goals necessitate a\n    comprehensive strategy that includes interventions for prevention and\n    control of categorical diseases and their risk factors, individual\n    behavioral change, environmental change, improvements in clinical and\n    preventive services, and organizational change (11). Promoting patient\n    compliance and health providers' adherence to established best practices in\n    all persons \u2014 regardless of patients' racial/ethnic background, sex,\n    geographic determinants, or socioeconomic status \u2014 is also important. These\n    interventions can be accomplished through a variety of mechanisms, including\n    health education, development and use of information systems, and\n    development and implementation of policies and guidelines. Policies, in\n    turn, can be implemented as regulations, ordinances, other laws, or as\n    organizational practices.\n\n\n    Achievement of these overarching national goals requires a strengthening of\n    the public health infrastructure and development of adequate capacity to\n    undertake the core public health functions of assessment, policy\n    development, and assurance (12). In all of these areas, the role of law  can be crucial. For\n    example, identifying and strengthening key components of the public health\n    infrastructure \u2014 such as the development of a diverse and competent public\n    health workforce, information and communication systems, and health\n    department surveillance and laboratory capacities \u2014 can be important purposes\n    of appropriate legislation (13, 14). Similarly, legislation can\n    help provide state or local governments with the power to encourage or induce\n    health care providers, allied health professionals, and businesses to\n    promote and protect the public's health in order to increase the quality and\n    number of years of healthy life (15). Laws can play pivotal roles in the\n    elimination of disparities in access to and delivery of quality health care\n    (16, 17, 18). In addition, appropriate laws undergird the broader mission of\n    state and local public health agencies in assessing the burden of chronic\n    diseases, setting priorities, allocating resources, and delivering health\n    services (14).\n\n\n    Laws work to achieve their desired results in a variety of ways. Some laws\n    directly require a behavioral change on the part of individuals in the\n    target population \u2014 such as seat belt laws \u2014 whereas others directly change the\n    environment \u2014 such as community water fluoridation or food fortification laws \u2014 \n    and require no new action on the part of the target population to be\n    effective. Other laws are more complex in their mechanism of inducing a\n    change. For example, some laws, such as smoking bans, require a behavioral\n    change that ultimately results in an environmental change with\n    beneficial effects on the target population. Other laws require an\n    organizational policy change that ultimately leads to a behavioral change, \n    such as required insurance-industry coverage of smoking cessation services, a\n    requirement that leads to an increased demand for and delivery of the\n    services, which eventually yields greater cessation rates. These examples and\n    still other laws have been used to address chronic diseases and injuries (Table 2). As discussed in the following sections, 3 of these laws \u2014 smoking bans, blood alcohol concentration (BAC)\n    laws, and food fortification regulations \u2014\n    demonstrate the impact and effectiveness of legislation on specific public\n    health problems. A fourth example, a legal framework for tobacco control,\n    illustrates the potential role of international law to\n    address chronic diseases and their major risk factors.\n\nPolicy interventions offer a great opportunity to influence decisions on\n    tobacco use at the societal level. Experience in the United States and in\n    other developed countries indicates that policy interventions have a\n    substantially greater impact than do interventions that target individuals.\n    International law now represents a tool for such policy interventions.\n    International law can be defined as the rules that regulate the relations\n    among sovereign states and other actors (e.g., international organizations\n    and individuals) in the international system (34). Treaties \u2014 written\n    agreements among sovereign states, the obligations of which are legally\n    binding \u2014 are one of the classic sources of international law (34).\n\nIn 1999, the World Health Organization (WHO) initiated the Framework\n    Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) as an international treaty focusing on\n    a health issue (34). In May 2003, the treaty text of the FCTC was\n    unanimously adopted by the World Health Assembly (35). This landmark health\n    treaty will be put into force when 40 member states have signed and ratified\n    it. The FCTC is both an international legal framework for tobacco control\n    (e.g., addressing international cigarette smuggling issues) and a framework\n    for a broad range of legal, regulatory, and policy approaches (e.g., excise\n    taxes, clean indoor air policies, restrictions or bans on advertising and\n    promotion, package warnings and labeling, product regulations, and\n    ingredient disclosures) that all WHO member states are encouraged to\n    implement.\n\nThe examples discussed above demonstrate the value of laws and regulations\n    in preventing and controlling diseases and injuries, as well as the\n    effectiveness of laws in helping to achieve program goals and objectives. In\n    addition, they highlight the rationale and need for more comprehensive, systematic\n    frameworks of legal theories and authorities to\n    support the prevention and control of a broader array of chronic diseases \n    (36).\n    \n\nThe basic elements of a conceptual legal framework include definitions of \n    key terms, delineation of scope, and articulation of a logic model or chain \n    of causation. A logic model for the role of law in chronic disease prevention \n    could trace\n    the flow of causality involving laws, agents of intervention (i.e., the\n    entities to which laws apply), the behavior of those agents (some behaviors\n    affect the sources of chronic disease while others affect those susceptible\n    to chronic disease), and health outcomes or status. Successful identification and implementation of legal\n    frameworks based on this logic model depend, in part, on a fuller\n    understanding of the spectrum of legal theories and methods relevant to\n    public health practice.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that the use of legal frameworks in public\n    health practice has limitations. Nor can law alone prevent chronic diseases. The process by which laws are passed \n    sometimes can be arduous and fraught with controversy. Even when appropriate \n    legislation is eventually enacted, the levels of application and enforcement \n    can vary a law's\n    effectiveness in achieving the intended public health goals.\n    Legal frameworks and laws should therefore not be used in isolation but should be\n    viewed as only one of several tools to be employed in the public health\n    practice armamentarium.\n\nLaws have played a decisive and fundamental role in advancing the \n    public's health. Their contribution is particularly evident in the \n    prevention and control of communicable diseases, which were the leading \n    causes of death at the turn of the 20th century, and in the realm of\n    injury prevention. Today, the leading causes of death and disability are\n    chronic diseases, especially diseases of the heart, cancer, and stroke. For\n    most of these chronic diseases, however, there are no systematically\n    developed frameworks for the application of law to preventive efforts. In\n    the relatively few instances where the role of law has been fully applied to\n    the prevention and control of chronic diseases and their risk factors (e.g., \n    tobacco control and prevention), the\n    observed impact and effectiveness demonstrate the public health benefits \n    they offered.\n\nThe time has come for a full exploration of comprehensive\n    legal frameworks for preventing and controlling the growing epidemics of\n    obesity, heart disease, stroke, and other chronic diseases and  their\n    related major risk factors. These frameworks will be a crucial addition to\n    the tools available to the public health workforce, especially state and\n    local health department program managers as well as state and national\n    policy makers. They also can assist program\n    managers' interaction with  city mayors, legislators,\n    governors, and other policy makers. Their successful development,\n    implementation, and continuing evaluation for effectiveness will require a\n    broadly collaborative, multidisciplinary effort guided by both scientific \n    and legal expertise. In an effort to expand the spectrum\n    of effective public health interventions, the CDC will work with its partners to explore the development of these systematic legal\n    frameworks as a tool for preventing chronic diseases and protecting and\n    promoting the public's health.\n\nIn the second part of this paper, we provide an overview of pertinent U.S.\n    jurisprudence, including current legal theories and methods, examine\n    examples of legal frameworks in public health, and conclude by suggesting\n    specific options for exploring the development of systematic legal\n    frameworks for preventing chronic diseases."}
