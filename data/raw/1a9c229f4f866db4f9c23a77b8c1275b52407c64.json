The reaction mixture was incubated at 65\u00b0 C 158 for 1 hour and the process was terminated at 80\u00b0 C for 10 mins using a hot water bath (KEMI, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/328674 doi: bioRxiv preprint India). Further for more visual differentiation to confirm the LAMP results (positive or negative), 160 a total of 5 DNA intercalating dyes were used and their details were presented in table 3. The 161 emission (RFU) was measured using Basic Fluorometer for the dyes EtBr and SYBR Green which 162 was measured using UV Excitation at ~375nm in a Basic fluorometer and for HNB dye the blue Optimization and Sensitivity of LAMP assay 179 The LAMP reactions were carried out to optimize a single temperature for greater efficiency. The observed for all the dyes when the template was less than 10 -7 ng from Xap1 isolate (Fig 5a) . All 238 the positive results from visualized LAMP assay was further assessed on 2% agarose gel and the 239 band pattern was slightly faint with respect to decrease in template DNA concentration (Fig 5b) .\n\nThe similar dilutions were also tested for its sensitivity using PCR based amplification of Xap 241 specific regions where the amplification was up to a template concentration of 10 -2 ng (Fig 5c) . 242 We observed that the EtBr had highest fluorescent among the dyes used for the assay (Fig 5d) . Specificity of the LAMP assay was evaluated using 10 Xap and 29 non-Xap isolates (Table 4) .\n\nThese non-Xap bacterial isolates belonged to other bacterial species collected from different 254 regions in Karnataka, India as detailed in Table 1 . The DNA template obtained from Xap isolates 255 which showed positive results when analyzed through the DNA intercalating dyes (Fig 6a) . 256 Further, it was reconfirmed on 2% agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig 6b) and the absorbance 257 intensity for the dyes was validated (Fig 6d) .

To avoid any false positive results, 29 bacterial 259 isolates collected from pomegranate were analysed which ultimately showed negative result for 260 LAMP assay (Fig S1) .

Xap1 bacterial culture was resuspended in sterile water and 286 inoculated on healthy plants using pin prick method. The prominent symptoms were observed from 287 the 11 th day after post inoculation, the oily lesions on the leaf surface were observed, which are 288 characteristic symptoms of the bacterial blight disease. The crude DNA isolation method was 289 followed to isolate DNA from the inoculated plants, every alternative day. After the pathogen 290 infectivity in the healthy plants, LAMP assay in agarose gel showed positive from 7 th day onwards 291 (Fig 7b) and for visualizing all the three dyes showed positive LAMP results from the 7 th day 292 onwards (Fig 7a) , in which the EtBr viewed to be most prominent comparing with other and its 293 absorbance intensity was increased with days (Fig 7d) . All the crude isolated DNA samples in 294 PCR method showed amplification from 11 th day onwards (Fig 7c) . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Since HNB is added in the LAMP reaction prior to the 370 process, the colour gradually changes from violet to blue as the dNTP's decreases as 371 amplification takes place. So, using dyes like HNB prior to the preceding LAMP reaction tubes 372 can be ideal to prevent a chance of wrong detection [38] . 373 For field level application, remote laboratories may not be well equipped where LAMP 374 detection technique can be employed in diagnosis of pathogens. This assay can even detect Xap in 375 much earlier crop stage than the traditional PCR method. In our greenhouse study after Xap 376 inoculation the LAMP assay detected Xap on 7 th day while, PCR method detected from 10 th day 377 onwards. However, the prominent symptoms of Xap infection on the leaf in the glass house study 378 appeared only after 10 th day of inoculation (Fig 7) 379 Improvised field applications such as working with crude extracts from plants with 380 minimal requirement will enhance the importance of the assay for rapid and accurate detection of "}
