{"title": "A case-control study evaluating RT-PCR/ESI-MS technology compared to direct fluorescent antibody and xTAG RVP PCR\u2606,\u2606\u2606,\u2605", "body": "fluorescent antibody (DFA) are rapid but can be laborious and have lower sensitivity than molecular diagnostics. Sequencing provides substantial information but is technically complex and impractical. Molecular diagnostics, although fairly complex, are becoming the preferred technology because of high sensitivity and shorter testing time.\n\nReverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) technology is a highly complex technology that provides accurate diagnostic information for respiratory viruses, particularly influenza A (Chen et al., 2011a (Chen et al., , 2011b Deyde et al., 2010 Deyde et al., , 2011 Forman et al., 2012; Jeng et al., 2012; Sampath et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2013; Murillo et al., 2013) .\n\nPerformance evaluations of RT-PCR/ESI-MS for respiratory virus detection have been performed, notably by Chen et al. (2011a , 2011b ), Forman et al. (2012 , Tang et al. (2013) . We expanded on these studies utilizing retrospectively collected waste nasopharyngeal swabs (NPs) and compared PLEX-ID RT-PCR/ESI-MS RVS 2.5 kit (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL, USA) results to both combined DFA and xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (xTAG RVP) (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX, USA) results as well as DFA and xTAG RVP individually, to determine percent agreement, sensitivity, specificity, and kappa for RVS 2.5.\n\nAs part of an institutional review board-approved study, waste NPs and their test results, DFA or xTAG RVP, were collected from clinical virology from 10/2011 to 2/2013. Samples were selected with a positive:negative test result ratio of 1:1 (N=244, positive n=122, negative n=122). All samples were initially tested by DFA (total N= 244, positive n = 44, negative n = 200); DFA negative samples were tested with xTAG RVP only if the patient was immunocompromised. xTAG RVP screening of immunocompromised patients yielded additional positive samples (n = 78) for comparison with RT-PCR/ESI-MS. The remaining samples (n = 122) were negative by either DFA only for non-immunocompromised individuals or negative by DFA and xTAG RVP for immunocompromised individuals.\n\nNucleic acid extraction was performed utilizing the Arrow (NorDiag, Oslo, Norway) per manufacturer's instructions. The Broad Respiratory Virus Surveillance Kit version 2.5 (RVS 2.5) and PLEX-ID were utilized for amplification and analysis per manufacturer's instructions. Positive reactions were defined as respiratory virus identification with a Q score \u22650.9, and results were compared to the reported diagnostic result, either DFA or xTAG RVP for determination of percent agreement, sensitivity, specificity, and kappa. All positive sample types were considered negative for specificity purposes for other viruses, i.e., samples respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) positive but influenza A/B negative were considered negative for calculating influenza specificity. Discordant testing was not performed due to sample and nucleic acid extract volume limitations.\n\nPositive samples consisted of: 34% influenza (n = 42, influenza A = 37, influenza B = 5), 26% RSV (n = 32), 15% coronavirus (n = 18), 11% metapneumovirus (n=13), 9% parainfluenza virus 1-3 (n= 11) and 5% adenovirus (n = 6).\n\nBy test, positive percent agreement was 93.2% (41/44) and 89.7% (70/78) for DFA and xTAG RVP, respectively. These results and positive percent agreement by specific virus are summarized in Table 1. DFA and xTAG RVP were also utilized as gold standards to calculate sensitivity and specificity, overall, and by virus for RVS 2.5 (Table 2) . RVS 2.5 results compared well to DFA and xTAG RVP. Overall agreement was 93% (227/244, kappa = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79-0.92); overall positive and negative agreement were both >90%. DFA and xTAG RVP were utilized as gold standard assays; sensitivity and specificity were both >90% for RT-PCR/ESI-MS compared to DFA and xTAG RVP. By virus, all percent agreements, sensitivities, and specificities were >90%. However, parainfluenza virus 1-3 had overall agreement and sensitivity of 63.4% (7/11). A limited number of parainfluenza 1-3 positives (n = 11) evaluated contributed to this; it does not appear that sample quality or volume was an issue because if this were the case, the results would be affected across all positive samples. The parainfluenza 1-3 false negatives as well as other false-negative results from the study were potentially because of the quantity of virus in the sample tested was below the limit of detection of 150 copies per well for all viruses the RVS primers amplify (Chen et al., 2011b) .\n\nThe results here are similar to Chen et al. (2011a Chen et al. ( , 2011b and Forman et al., (2012 Chen et al., (2011b) . This study reports higher agreement for metapneumovirus than Forman et al. (2012) , at 92.3%, although this study evaluated fewer metapneumovirus positives (n = 13).\n\nNucleic acid extraction methodology utilized here differed between this study and Chen et al. (2011a Chen et al. ( , 2011b and Forman et al. (2012) and possibly contributed to sensitivity and specificity improvements.\n\nDespite numerous limitations to the study, the results presented here add additional performance characteristic information to previously published studies that utilized RT-PCR/ESI-MS for the detection and identification of respiratory viruses (Deyde et al., 2010 (Deyde et al., , 2011 Sampath et al., 2007; Tang et al., 2013; Murillo et al., 2013) .\n\nFew samples positive for coronavirus, metapneumovirus and adenovirus were tested. No further analysis was performed on discrepant results due to low sample and nucleic acid extract volumes after RT-PCR/ESI-MS testing was completed. This was especially the case for the DFA-negative/RT-PCR/ESI-MS-positive samples ( Table 1) . Comparison of DFA with RT-PCR/ESI-MS was problematic because comparison of a non-amplified diagnostic, DFA, with an amplified diagnostic, RT-PCR/ESI-MS, may have skewed the RT-PCR/ESI-MS performance characteristics. Additionally, all of the xTAG RVP-positive results were initially DFA negative, and this discrepancy was also problematic. Additionally, DFA could have generated false-positive results, as 3 DFA-positive detections were not confirmed by RT-PCR/ESI-MS or xTAG RVP. Amore accurate comparison would have utilized 2 amplified tests, such as xTAG RVP and type specific real-time PCR. Although DFA comparison was suboptimal, it was the best available comparison method based on clinical virology screening algorithms used to report respiratory virus diagnoses. Finally, xTAG RVP assay was only performed on DFA-negative samples collected among immunocompromised patient negatives as per clinical virology testing algorithm policy. Many DFA-negative samples collected among immunocompetent patients could have tested positive with xTAG RVP. Additionally, the DFA negative, RT-PCR/ESI-MS false positives (Table 1. ) could have been more accurately confirmed if RT-PCR/ESI-MS and xTAG RVP had been directly compared for those samples.\n\nRT-PCR/ESI-MS technology demonstrated the capability to detect and identify respiratory viruses when compared to DFA and xTAG RVP, and all have utility in screening NP samples for respiratory viruses. Based on the limitations associated with this study, further evaluations of RT-PCR/ESI-MS technology, including prospective analysis and comparison with multiple molecular methods, will be required before clinical implementation. a Indicates a false-positive result defined as a result that was positive utilizing the PLEX-ID RVS 2.5 kit and negative by DFA."}
