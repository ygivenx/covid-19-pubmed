{"title": "Distinguishing Effects of Cocaine IV and SC on Mesoaccumbens Dopamine and Serotonin Release With Chloral Hydrate Anesthesia", "body": "(Rattus norvegicus) with in vivo electrochemistry (voltammetry). In further in vivo voltammetric studies, the effects of SC cocaine on synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT were studied in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm in two neuroanatomic substrates, NAcc and mesoaccumbens somatodendrites, the ventral tegmental area (VTA-At0), in a doseresponse fashion (10, 20 , and 40 mg/kg) in six separate studies. Moreover, in two additional in vivo voltammetric studies, again using the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm, the impulse flow blocker, ~-butyrolactone (3,-BL) (750 mg/kg, IP), was studied alone and in combination with SC cocaine (20 mg/kg) to determine whether or not cocaine can act by presynaptic releasing mechanisms for DA and 5-HT. The results show that IV cocaine concurrently and significantly increased DA and 5-HT release in the NAcc (p < 0.001, p < 0.0005, respectively) at both doses tested. Moreover, IV cocaine effects on DA and 5-HT release were significantly and positively correlated (p < 0.01). On the other hand, SC cocaine concurrently and significantly decreased DA and 5-HT release in NAcc (/9 < 0.0001) and VTA (p < 0.0001) at each separate dose tested. SC cocaine effects on DA and 5-HT release were significantly and positively correlated across dose and neuroanatomic substrate (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the ~/-BL studies indicate that cocaine's action includes a presynaptic release mechanism for the biogenic amines. Summarily, the data show that a consideration of the route of cocaine administration is crucial in determining the underlying neurochemical basis for cocaine.\n\nDopamine Serotonin Ventrolateral nucleus accumbens Chloral hydrate anesthesia Ventral tegmental area\n\nIn vivo electrochemistry (voltammetry) THERE is a general consensus from clinical and preclinical studies that cocaine has specific dopaminergic (DAergic) influences associated with its craving or craving-like syndrome (15, 20, 25, 30, (42) (43) (44) 46) . Predominantly, the evidence shows that the behavioral types of cocaine reinforcement involve an operative mesoaccumbens DAergic hyperfunction in Al0 nerve terminals [nucleus accumbens (NAcc)] (7, 11, 24, 27, 40) and in Al0 somatodendrites [ventral tegmental area (VTA)] (9) . Of necessity, though, the correlation between cocaine-induced enhancement of dopamine (DA) overflow and its associated behavior was demonstrated in the freely moving animal para-digm. In this paradigm, adequate recovery from surgery precludes anesthetic consequence. On the other hand, studies of the electrophysiological effects of cocaine on impulse frequency rates (cell firing) of DA neurons in the VTA have been examined in animals anesthetized with chloral hydrate (16) . Therefore, because pre-and postsynaptic release mechanisms are contingent upon somatodendritic impulse frequency rates, nuances in DA cell responsiveness due to either or both general and local anesthesia deserve consideration. Recent reports have shown that chloral hydrate, a general anesthetic, changes a) the basal activity, b) the pharmacologi-cal responsiveness, and c) the spontaneous activity (burst firing) of mesolimbic mesoaccumbens DA neurons; suppression of burst firing occurs in a continuum with effects of general anesthetics > local anesthetics > no anesthetic (18, 28) . Given this caveat, we assessed the effects of IV cocaine on synaptic concentrations of DA in the NAcc and VTA in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm. The IV route of administration was chosen for direct comparison to electrophysiological studies. Moreover, further studies were done to assess the effect of cocaine when it is administered SC because no neurochemical studies of this kind have been addressed, despite the early data distinguishing the pharmacokinetic effects of IV and SC cocaine (36) .\n\nThe monoamine-containing neurons for DA (the A class) and serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] (the B class) have been described by Dahlstrom and Fuxe (14) . At first thought to be distinct and separate neurotransmitters in distinct and separate neuronal fiber pathways, a rethinking, commingling these monoamines, has emerged appendant to the demonstration of a wide occurrence of 5-HT positive nerve terminals throughout the CNS (47) . A sequence of events occurred in the analytic study of the 5-HT organization in brain that initially demonstrated a prominent transtegmental 5-HT fiber pathway in the A~0 region that begins in the median and dorsal mesencephalic raphe nuclei and curves ventrally across the VTA to communicate in the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) (38, 48) . Subsequently, 5-HT axons project from the MFB to NAcc (1) . A more recent study shows that 5-HT axons directly innervate DA neurons in the VTA (23) .\n\nInterestingly, empirical evidence for a 5-HTergic mediation or intermediation with mesoaccumbens DA in cocaine reinforcement behavior has also been gleaned using the freely moving rat animal model (7) (8) (9) 32 ). Yet, as is the case with the scientific literature regarding DAergic impulse frequency rates in the VTA, the 5-HT electrophysiological data were derived from studies of cocaine's effects on impulse frequency rates in the dorsal raphe (DR) in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm (13) . Accordingly, we study here the effects of cocaine on 5-HT release in the NAcc and VTA sequentially and on line with DA release in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm.\n\nRelease mechanisms are evidenced by an assessment of the electroactive species for DA and 5-HT using the impulse flow inhibitor, -y-butyrolactone (~-BL) (49) . Release mechanisms are known to be dependent upon the frequency of impulse flow whereas uptake processes are said to be time dependent (34) . Rats were anesthetized for surgery with an IP injection of chloral hydrate (450 mg/kg). An additional injection of chloral hydrate (0.1 cc) was administered every 40 min to maintain adequate depth of anesthesia; leg flexion and corneal and pinnal responses were assessed. The indicator (working) microelectrode was slowly inserted (0.5 mm in l min at 5-min intervals) into ventrolateral NAcc and into VTA in separate groups of animals using the stereotaxic coordinates of Pelligrino and Cushman (39) . The stereotaxic coordinates were: NAcc: from bregma A = 2.6, ML = +2.5, and DV = -7.3; VTA: from bregma P = 2.8, ML = +0.9, and DV = -8.6. An Ag/AgC1 reference microelectrode and stainless steel auxiliary microelectrode combination was placed in contact with dura. Each microelectrode of the three-microelectrode assembly was constructed in this laboratory. Body temperature was continuously monitored with a rectal probe attached to a thermometer (Fisher Scientific, Fadem, N J) and was continuously maintained at 37 _+ 0.5\u00b0C with an Aquamatic K module heating pad (American Hospital Supply, Edison, N J). This was done a) to prevent electrochemical peak potential (Eap) shifts because E,p is temperature dependent and b) to prevent anesthetic-induced hypothermia. Each animal was treated with a great deal of care throughout the studies.\n\nCocaine HCI (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in deionized, organic free water (resistance = 5-10 Mfl). The solution was made fresh on each day of study. Cocaine was administered IV after each in vivo electrochemical signal for DA and 5-HT in the NAcc was uniform within SE _+ 5%, for at least 40 min. Cocaine effects on the separate electroactive species for DA and 5-HT were studied concurrently for 1 h at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg and at a subsequent dose of 1.0 mg/kg for 1 h. Cocaine was administered IV through cannulation of the femoral vein. The femoral vein was cannulated with 0.965 mm o.d. tubing (PE-50, Clay Adams, Parsippany, N J). Femoral vein cannulation was completed within 15 min. The time for the entire surgical procedure and study was approximately 5.5 h.\n\nMoreover, cocaine was administered SC to six different groups of animals: Three groups had working microelectrodes placed in the ventrolateral NAcc; three groups had working microelectrodes placed in the VTA. A dose-response study was done on the separate effects of 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg SC cocaine on synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT in the synaptic environment of either the NAcc or VTA. Cocaine was administered SC after each in vivo electrochemical signal for DA and for 5-HT was uniform within SE _+ 5% for at least 40 min. SC cocaine effects were studied for 3 h after cocaine administration because of its reported longer half-life (tl/2) in brain (36) .\n\nStudies were also done to address a possible presynaptic mechanism of action of release for cocaine by using the known DA neuronal impulse blocker, -y-BL. The effect of \"y-BL is equivalent to axotomy (49) . ~,-BL [750 mg/kg, IP (corrected for density at 1.12 g/cc)] was purchased in liquid form (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). It was administered to two different groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats. In one group, after the DA and 5-HT electrochemical signals were uniform within SE +_ 5% for at least 40 min, the effect of \"F-BL on the electroactive species for DA and 5-HT was studied for 40-60 min. In the other group, after the same stabile environment for basal synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT was evident and after one third of the DAergic impulse flow was blocked by \"y-BL, cocaine (20 mg/kg, SC) was administered. The effects of SC cocaine on synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT in the NAcc was studied for l h after neuronal impulse inhibition by \"y-BL. The ),-BL impulse flow inhibition studies were done in the SC cocaine-anesthetized paradigm in NAcc for direct comparison with previous 3,-BL-cocaine studies completed in the freely moving animal paradigm (8) .\n\nThe methods for the formulation of in vivo electrochemical working microelectrodes including the conditioning or preconcentration steps and the specifications for the synthesis of the stearic acid carbon paste are published by this laboratory (5) . A review of the historic and technical aspects of the field of in vivo electrochemistry is referenced (6) . Electrocatalytic interactions between DA and ascorbic acid (AA) have been reported with a stearic acid macroelectrode in vitro (21) , but more recent reports show that these interactions are insignificant in neuronal tissue in vivo when a stearic acid microelectrode is used (2) .\n\nIn the present studies, stearate microelectrodes (size = 200 /~m diameter; 500/~m length) were used in combination with semidifferential (semiderivative) voltammetry. Dopamine and 5-HT were detected within 10-15 and 10-13 s, respectively, and sequentially in two separate waveforms on the in vitro and in vivo voltammogram in both the NAcc and VTA. DA was the first signal and 5-HT the second to be detected in the time course of the applied potential (Eapp). Eap for DA is +0.140 + 0.015 V. Even at high concentrations, the anionic metabolite of DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), was not detected. At high concentrations, however, ascorbic acid (AA), the cofactor in the DA biosynthetic pathway, was detectable but at a different Eap than that for DA or 5-HT. The neurotransmitter 5-HT was detected within a 10-13 s time period at an Eap of + 0.290 + 0.015 V. Neither the metabolite of 5-HT, that is, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), nor uric acid (UA), which is a constituent of brain with similar electroactive Eap properties to those of 5-HT, was part of the 5-HT signal. In vivo electrochemical parameters such as E~p for DA and 5-HT are the same in the VTA as in NAcc, given that conditions of temperature, pH, resistance, capacitance, time constants, sensitivities, and preconcentration procedures are not changed. Each voltammogram is completed within 60 s in vivo. Initial potential (Eapp) was -0.200 V; the end E~pp was +0.400 V; the scan rate was 10 mV s-~. Potentials were applied to the working microelectrode with respect to an Ag/ AgC1 microelectrode (with 0.16 M saline) by a CV37 detector potentiostat (BAS, West Lafayette, IN). The CV37 was electrically connected to a Minigard Surge Suppressor (Jefferson Electric, Magnetek, NY), which was then connected to an isolated electrical ground. There was a 6-min interval between the completion of one voltammogram and the 2-min cell activation for the next voltammogram. Non-Faradaic charging current (Cdt) was eliminated in the first 25 s of each scan. Coulombic efficiency for the detection of 5-HT was two-to threefold greater than that for DA as shown by previous in vitro studies (4, 5) .\n\nWorking microelectrodes were precalibrated in vitro in a fresh, deaerated saline (0.16 M) phosphate buffer (PO4) solution, pH 7.4 (0.01 M) containing aliquots of nmol solutions of DA and 5-HT [DA (purity, 99070): Sigma; and 5-HT (purity, 99070): Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI]. The buffer was deareated with prepurified nitrogen gas (N2) extra dry grade, 5 psi, (T.W. Smith Co., Brooklyn, NY). N~ gas was perfused through the PO4 buffer, which was regulated by a Variable Area Flowmeter (Purgemaster, Fisher Scientific Co., Fadem, N J). The Variable Area Flowmeter was calibrated at 90-100 cc/min. Deaeration took place for 1 min before each cell acti-vation period and subsequent voltammetric scan from E~ (Initial Eapv) began. Working microelectrodes were also postcalibrated in vitro in a freshly deoxygenated PO4 buffer solution pH 7.4 (0.01 M), made exactly as was the precalibration buffer, after each study was completed. Peak area of each DA and 5-HT signal was calculated by multiplying the peak height (mm) of each electrochemical signal by the width (mm) of each electrochemical signal at one half the peak height (mm). Detectable basal concentrations of DA and 5-HT, less than 5 and 1 nmol, respectively, are currently possible with this biotechnology.\n\nHistological placements of working microelectrodes in the NAcc and VTA, in separate groups of animals, were confirmed by the potassium ferrocyanide blue dot method. The precise electrical specifications for deposition of the blue dot in the NAcc and VTA was 50 ~tA current in a 30-s time period. Virtually no damage to brain tissue occurred.\n\nStatistically significant differences between basal synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT vis-a-vis drug-affected synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT were determined by standard repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Statview, Brain Power Inc., Calabasas, CA). ANOVAs were followed by posthoc tests, Fisher's PLSD (least square differences), and Scheffe's F-test (Statview, Brain Power) to determine hourly statistically significant differences. Statistically significant differences were also calculated on the individual time course data points by 95070 confidence limits (95070 CL), setting the p value at p < 0.05. Changes in DA and 5-HT values after IV or SC cocaine treatment vis-a-vis untreated (same animal) controls are presented as 070 change to minimize normal between animal variations. Because the actual detection time for DA is 10-15 s, the 070 change in synaptic concentrations of DA at each data point, postcocaine, represents a 10-15 s current change (pA) from baseline, that is, current detected within a discrete synaptic environment of the NAcc or VTA at the microelectrode surface within a 10-15 s time period in the presence of cocaine vis-a-vis the absence of cocaine. The same principle of in vivo electrochemical detection applies for 5-HT. Because the actual detection time for 5-HT at each data point is 10-13 s, the 070 change in synaptic concentrations of 5-HT, at each data point postcocaine, represents a current measurement within the same discrete synaptic environment as that for DA, within the NAcc or VTA within a 10-13 s time period, in the presence of cocaine vis4t-vis the absence of cocaine. Control is represented as 100\u00b070. 7-BL data are also normalized. In vivo electrochemical signals for DA and 5-HT in the NAcc and VTA were studied for statisti- \n\nThe present findings show that IV cocaine exerts enhancing effects on DA release in NAcc in the presence of chloral hydrate anesthesia. Taken together with other studies showing comparable IV cocaine-DAergic effects in the NAcc in the freely moving animal paradigm (11, 24, 40) , the data show that the general anesthetic effects of chloral hydrate do not influence the response of DA in the NAcc to IV cocaine. Previous findings have also posited a lack of local anesthetic involvement in the Al0 response to IV cocaine (16) . Too, the present results are in agreement with previous in situ studies, using the anesthetized paradigm, that show that IV cocaine increased extracellular DA concentrations in the NAcc (35) and increased extracellular DA concentrations in both the NAcc and VTA (3) . Consistent with the latter study, baseline DA concentrations in the VTA were generally less than those in the NAcc. However, it is noteworthy that the comparison between the two studies is relative, that is, whereas each dialysate sampling (3) of DA is integrated over 20 min, each in vivo electrochemical sampling of DA occurs within 10-15 s. Moreover, the present data are consistent with the literature with respect to the time course effects of IV cocaine (3, 35) . Indeed, the significantly increased DA release, which remains visible 60 min after IV cocaine administration (1 mg/kg) despite decreased levels of cocaine in the NAcc (37), may help explain the addictive potency of cocaine. Notably, new findings show that 5-HT release is significantly increased in the NAcc after IV cocaine in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized preparation. The 5-HT effect is concurrent and correlated with the DAergic response; this is particularly interesting because somatodendritic cell firing rates in the VTA and DR after cocaine also parallel each other, at least acutely (13, 16) . The results are in clear agreement with current thinking that cocaine-induced terminal reuptake inhibition (22, 45) , which would also elevate synaptic DA and 5-HT, can produce a silencing of VTA and DR cell firing.\n\nNonetheless, in contrast to the suppression of DA cell firing in the VTA and also 5-HT cell firing in the DR, both of which are seen after IV administration of cocaine, the direct microiontophoretic application of cocaine only weakly blocks VTA and DR cell firing (13, 16) . This discrepancy may indicate further the involvement of a long loop negative feedback interplay. Importantly, though, it may have additional implications, that is, other actions, are involved in the systemic effects of cocaine. Correspondingly, cocaine has long-lived and powerful peripheral vasoconstrictor effects. In fact, cocaine is the only local anesthetic that is a vasoconstrictor (41) . Cocaine has been shown to increase the vasoactive sensitivity and/or maximum response of the coronary and femoral artery to other vasoactive substances, NE, 5-HT, and the thromboxane A 2 analog, U-46619 (26) . Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic effects of cocaine are highly dependent upon route of administration. Nayak et al. (36) reported that the tl/2 of acute IV cocaine is 0.3 and 0.4 h in blood and brain, respectively, whereas the fl/2 of acute SC cocaine is 0.8 and 1.0 h in brain and blood, respectively; cocaine is seen in brain 4 h after SC administration (36) . Thus, cocaine via the SC route provides longer-lasting effects than the IV route, in part due to local vasoconstriction and in part due to absorptive processes, which are inherently eliminated with IV injection.\n\nGiven these dramatic dispositional differences, then, new findings are presented showing that SC cocaine administration caused a dose-dependent decrease in DA and 5-HT release concurrently, in the NAcc and in VTA. The results repeat previous studies showing that the DAergic response to SC cocaine (20 mg/kg) was decreased in the NAcc in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized rat (10) . A colocalization of DA and 5-HT was apparent and the decrease in biogenic amine release, coinduced by cocaine, was highly correlative. The neuroanatomic substrate VTA appears more vulnerable than does the NAcc to the biogenic amine effects of SC cocaine, although the NAcc was significantly affected. However, perhaps most contributory from the present findings is the demonstration that \"route of administration\" of cocaine significantly affects the neurochemical DA and 5-HT response to cocaine. The data lend an explanatory note to previous data showing that the route of administration of cocaine, even on an acute basis, influences behavior differently (31) and that even the pattern of cocaine administration within any one route may evoke differential responses (29) . Importantly, if one can assume identical cell firing effects with both SC and IV cocaine in the VTA and DR, the present data reveal that increased synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT at the neuronal terminal may not be necessary for, or are uncoupled with, cocaine's action on somatodendrites.\n\nImportantly, these findings show that the SC route of administration significantly decreased the cocaine-induced response to DA release in the NAcc and VTA. Taken together with other data (7, 9) , which show that SC cocaine increased DA release in the NAcc and VTA, the present data indicate that cocaine-induced effects on mesoaccumbens DA release are subject to the general anesthetic effects previously described (18, 28) . The data are supported clinically; surgery is complicative in the cocaine-addicted patient (17) . Moreover, the general anesthetic effects that influence the DAergic reaction to SC cocaine in the anesthetized paradigm do not cross over to the 5-HTergic response in DA pathways in the conscious paradigm (7) .\n\nProvocatively, the present results may be explained as the biogenic aminergic response to the formation of a cocaine metabolite and not to cocaine. Because the disposition of SC cocaine is long lived, further opportunity is provided for metabolite derivation. One cocaine metabolite, benzoylecgonine, itself is a potent vasoconstrictor with vasoactive properties greater than NE and cocaine (33) . Interestingly, benzoylecgonine does not increase reinforcement behavior and also does not displace [3H]cocaine binding (46) . Thus, it is possible that the action of SC cocaine in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized rat paradigm is due to the formation of benzoylecgonine.\n\nFinally, presynaptic DA and 5-HT release mechanisms for cocaine are evidenced here because release mechanisms are dependent upon impulse flow and cocaine's actions on synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT in the NAcc were inhibited when impulse flow was blocked with \"t-BL. SC cocaine did not further significantly alter synaptic concentrations of DA in the NAcc in the presence of neuronal impulse flow inhibition with \"r-BL. Therefore, other data that show that available synaptic DA is necessary for the action of cocaine (8, 12) are supported. The data agree with another report showing that cocaine does not reverse 3~-BL-altered DAergic function (19) . Also, the evidence presented for a presynaptic 5-HTergic releasing mechanism is in agreement with a previous report (8) . The evidence is more conclusive here for 5-HT than for DA because the electroactive species for 5-HT is exactly subtended when neuronal impulse flow is blocked. Alternatively, the explanation for the 5-HTergic effects of cocaine after 3,-BL, may be simply that the cocaine-induced 5-HT reuptake inhibitory effects are seen after release mechanisms are blocked.\n\nIn summary, the data show a) that IV cocaine effects on DA and 5-HT release are not influenced by anesthesia, b) that IV and SC cocaine differ in their resultant neurochemical effects on DA and 5-HT release, and c) that the effect of SC cocaine on DA release is influenced by chloral hydrate anesthesia. Interestingly, acute SC cocaine administration may provide a unique acute animal model for the study of DA depletion by chronic cocaine and/or its metabolites."}
