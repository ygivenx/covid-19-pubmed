{"title": "First isolation and characterisation of Alongshan virus in Russia", "body": "In recent decades, many new flavi-like viruses have been discovered in different invertebrates. All of them share homology in the nonstructural proteins with the well-studied flavivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5 and RNA helicase-protease NS3, but they differ greatly from each other regarding other proteins, as well as in overall genome size and structure .\n\nThe Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) group holds a special place among flavi-like viruses because in contrast to the \"classic\" flaviviruses and other flavi-like viruses, they have a segmented ssRNA(+) genome (Ladner et al., 2016; Maruyama et al., 2014; Qin et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019a) , which is more commonly observed in viruses of fungi and plants (Lefkowitz et al., 2018) . The only other known viruses with a segmented ssRNA (+) genome are representatives of the family Nodaviridae and infect insects (Alphanodavirus) and fish (Betanodavirus) (Yong et al., 2017) .\n\nTwo segments of the JMTV group genome are homologous to the regions of the Flavivirus genome encoding NS3 and NS5 proteins. The remaining segments are specific only to JMTVs. Additionally, in contrast to the \"classic\" flaviviruses that have one long open reading frame (ORF) and virion size of 40-60 nm, these viruses have several ORFs within single segments and virion sizes varying from 30-35 nm to 70-100 nm (Ladner et al., 2016; Qin et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2019a) . It has also been suggested that genomic RNAs of a multicomponent virus can be packaged in separate virions (Ladner et al., 2016) , although this has not yet been demonstrated.\n\nThe geographic distribution of the JMTV group is very wide, encompassing Asia (Din\u00e7er et al., 2019; Jia et al., 2019; Qin et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2016) , Europe (Din\u00e7er et al., 2019;  Some representatives of the JMTV group were detected in patients with other infections transmitted by arthropods (Emmerich et al., 2018) .\n\nAlongshan virus (ALSV), a representative of the JMTV group, was detected in I. persulcatus ticks, Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Anopheles yatsushiroensis mosquitoes in China (Wang et al., 2019a) and later in I. ricinus ticks in Finland and France (Kuivanen et al., 2019; Temmam et al., 2019) . ALSV was suspected to infect mammals and cause illness in humans (Wang et al., 2019b (Wang et al., , 2019a .\n\nOur work presents data on the isolation of ALSV in the Russian Federation and new data on the genome organization of this and other known representatives of the JMTV group.\n\nWe collected unfed adult I. persulcatus ticks in Chelyabinsk region and in the Republic of Karelia in May-June 2014 (Supplementary file 1). The ticks were pooled, homogenised and the homogenates screened for flavivirus NS5 RNA. The PCR products from three flaviviruspositive tick pools were Sanger-sequenced. The resultant sequences were analysed with BLAST.\n\nAll three isolates, named Miass519, Miass527 and Galozero-14-T20426, were found to be 90.48 -91.03% similar to Alongshan virus.\n\nTo isolate the virus from tick homogenate, we inoculated cultures of the IRE/CTVM19 tick cell line. An IRE/CTVM19 culture inoculated with the Miass527 sample was kept for a year with regular medium changes but without passaging or subculture; individual tick cell cultures can be maintained for long periods without subculture (Bell-Sakyi et al., 2007) . Since the virus did not cause any cytopathic effect in these cells, we changed the medium once every 14 days.\n\nOnce every 1-2 months we checked the culture medium by RT-PCR for presence of the virus, using specific primers MiassF and MiassR (Supplementary file 2). After a year of maintenance, 200\u03bcl of supernate from the Miass527-infected IRE/CTVM19 culture was passaged into a new flat-sided culture tube with uninfected IRE/CTVM19 cells. This new Miass527-infected culture was subcultured by splitting the cells at a ratio of 1:1 twice in the first 6 months of infection and after that was kept without passaging or subculture. In this condition Miass527-infected cells have been monitored for over 3 years (observation is still continuing). IRE/CTVM19 cells inoculated with samples Miass519 and Galozero-14-T20426 were each subcultured 1:1 twice in the first 2 months after infection and, at the time of writing, have been monitored for 4 months.\n\nRT-PCR analysis revealed that the strain Miass527 successfully persisted in the tick cell line for a year, followed by one passage and further three years persistence at the time of writing.\n\n.

For the phylogenetic analysis, we used RNA sequences from 18 GenBank entries of representatives of the JMTV group and the three ALSV strains isolated in the present study (Table 1 ). The phylogenetic analysis was performed on a 1732 bp fragment of segment 2. Interestingly, one of the JMTV isolates (MN095520 -isolate JMTV/I.ricinus/France) clustered with the ALSV sequences. For consistency, we included this JMTV sequence in all our analyses of ALSV (see below). All three of our strains belonged to ALSV and formed one monophyletic group with the strain H3 isolated in China (Figure 1 ).\n\nWe used pool of cell culture supernate collected after one passage of strain Miass527 in IRE/CTVM19 cells, at 17, 19, 20 and 32 months after initial isolation for transmission electron microscopic examination. The IRE/CTVM19 tick cell line was recently reported to contain RNA sequences with similarity to rhabdoviruses (Bell-Sakyi and Attoui, 2016) . To prevent confusion between ALSV and this putative rhabdovirus in our microscopic examination, we first screened the pellet obtained after ultracentrifugation of uninfected IRE/CTVM19 for rhabdovirus RNA using specific primers (Supplementary file 2). We detected an unknown rhabdovirus and named it IRE/CTVM19-associated rhabdovirus. Since this new rhabdovirus was also detected in the Miass527-infected IRE/CTVM19 cell pellet, we subjected the dissolved pellet to sucrose density gradient separation and selected the fraction with the largest amount of ALSV RNA and very The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/862573 doi: bioRxiv preprint fraction of the gradient as used for the ALSV-infected IRE/CTVM19 cells. In this fraction we found small spherical particles with a diameter of 15.7 \u00b1 1.8 nm, which had electron-dense cores ( Figure 2 , E, Supplementary file 6). These small particles could be virions of an unknown virus, protein structures or some other unidentified component of IRE/CTVM19 cells.\n\nWe sequenced full genomes of the strains Miass527 and Miass519. Segments 1, 3 and 4 of the newly-isolated Miass strains were more similar to each other than to previously-described ALSV strains. However, segment 2 of the strain Miass527 was more similar to the Chinese strain H3 than to Miass519, while segment 2 of the strain Miass519 was closer to JMTV/I.ricinus/France than to Miass527 (Table 2) .\n\nOverall, the full genomes of the Miass strains demonstrated >88% nucleotide identity to the other strains of ALSV known to date, with glycoprotein-coding segment 2 having the highest similarity and NS5-like protein coding segment 1 being the most divergent. (Wang et al., 2019a) . Interestingly, we were not able to identify signal peptides in either VP2 or VP1a using TMHMM v.2.0 software.\n\nWe performed a search of the functional elements in the VP1a region with the Synplot2 program (Firth, 2014) . Using codon alignment of four previously-described ALSV strains (MH158416, MN107154, MN107158, MN095520) and the three strains sequenced in this study, we discovered two regions of high conservation in the VP1a ORF ( Figure 4A ). The first one corresponded to the 3`-terminal region of the ORF. We believe that such high conservation in this region was caused by an overlap with the VP1b ORF. We managed to find a slippery motif (A AAA AAC) followed by a spacer and an RNA structure (Supplementary file 8) in this region .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/862573 doi: bioRxiv preprint of the VP1a ORF that theoretically would allow VP1b to be translated via -1 ribosome frameshift ( Figure 3 ).\n\nAdditionally, Synplot2 allowed us to identify an unusually high conservation rate in the first ~110 codons of VP1a ORF in segment 2. We believe that this conservation was caused by an additional ORF that was found in this region. This novel upstream ORF (nuORF) is 399 nt long, is located upstream of the VP1a ORF and has a 365 nt overlap with it ( Figure 4A ).\n\nApplication of the tblastn algorithm using the protein sequence encoded by the Miass527 nuORF as an entry revealed homologs within the JMTV group (Supplementary file 9). Upon further inspection, all of the resultant sequences were shown to have a nuORF. Thus we decided to test known JMTV sequences for existence of the additional ORF upstream of the VP1 region with Synplot2.\n\nWe searched for a full-length segment 2 of JMTV using blast algorithm and strain SY84 JMTV full segment 2 sequence as an entry. Since relationships within the JMTV group are not yet decided and some representatives of this group have different names, we could not use a GenBank search. Sequences MN095532 and KX377514 were found to have unknown nucleotides in the middle of the segment and were not used in the analysis. For these sequences, nuORF was confirmed to be intact. We then constructed a phylogenetic tree (Supplementary file 10) that allowed us to identify three groups (Jingmen, Yanggou and Alongshan viruses) that should be analysed separately due to phylogenetic distance. All JMTV sequences with full segment 2 (21 entries) known to date (November 8, 2019) have a nuORF. We performed analysis of the JMTV segment 2 sequences ( Figure 4B ) and Synplot2 showed high conservation in the first ~100-codon region. This demonstrates that the region associated with nuORF is conserved more highly than would be expected under neutral evolution in both ALSV and JMTV sequences.\n\nWe also tested the Yanngou virus sequences and, although all of the full genome sequences had a nuORF, Synplot2 program did not find a region of higher-than-expected conservation in the first ~100 codons of Yanngou virus VP1a (Supplementary file 11). However, there are only three known full-length segment 2 sequences of Yanggou virus and the number of sequences is important to acquire statistics needed for a prediction.\n\nOverall, the ALSV nuORF encoded 132 amino acids. According to the prediction, this protein may have an N-terminal signal sequence and three transmembrane regions with a Cterminal tail, thus making the nuORF product a small membrane protein ( Figure 5A ).\n\nThe predicted protein encoded by the nuORF of JMTVs was shorter (~106 aa) and had ~50% identity to the ALSV nuORF product. It had an overall structure similar to that of ALSV, .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/862573 doi: bioRxiv preprint with a proposed N-terminal signal sequence and three predicted transmembrane regions, but, in contrast to the ALSV nuORF, it had no C-terminal tail ( Figure 5B ).\n\nDue to the development of molecular virology, high-throughput sequencing and viral metagenomics, many new flavi-like viruses have been discovered in recent decades (Qin et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2016; Villa et al., 2017) . A large number of flavi-like viruses have been detected in or isolated from arthropods (Huhtamo et al., 2014 (Huhtamo et al., , 2009 Shi et al., 2016) , but their ability to cause infection and disease in vertebrates and their medical significance are not known.\n\nThe JMTV group is a recently-discovered group of segmented ssRNA(+) viruses that infect different species of invertebrates, including insects, ticks and nematodes (Callister et al., 2008; Jia et al., 2019; Kuivanen et al., 2019; Qin et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2016; Tetteh et al., 1999; Webster et al., 2015) . Moreover, some representatives of the new flavi-like viruses were detected in patients who had other severe infectious diseases (Emmerich et al., 2018) , and these viruses might themselves cause illness in humans (Jia et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019a) . There is still little information about the replication and overall coding strategy of this novel virus group.\n\nALSV is a representative of the JMTV group. It was first isolated in China from a patient suffering fever of unknown aetiology (Wang et al., 2019a) . Subsequently, the virus was detected in I. persulcatus ticks and Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Anopheles yatsushiroensis mosquitoes in China (Wang et al., 2019a) and in I. ricinus ticks in Finland (Kuivanen et al., 2019) and France (Temmam et al., 2019) . It was shown that ALSV is able to infect mammals and cause illness in humans (with symptoms including headache, fever, fatigue and depression) (Wang et al., 2019a (Wang et al., , 2019b . Thus, additional isolates of this virus from new geographical locations will be important for understanding its distribution, as well as for the local healthcare systems. New genome data could also provide additional information on the structural organization of the ALSV genome.\n\nWe isolated three strains of ALSV from I. persulcatus ticks collected in Chelyabinsk region in the south of European Russia, and in the Republic of Karelia in north-west Russia. We sequenced two full genomes of the new ALSV strains Miass527 and Miass519 from Chelyabinsk region and obtained partial sequences of segment 2 for the ALSV strain Galozero-14-T20426 from the Republic of Karelia. Although these three strains were isolated from territories distant from each other, phylogenetic analysis of the segment 2 sequences showed that they form a single monophyletic group with the strain H3 isolated in China.\n\nThe segments 1, 3 and 4 of the strains Miass519 and Miass527 were more similar to each other than to previously described ALSV strains. Segment 2 of the strain Miass527 was more similar to the strain H3 than to Miass519, while segment 2 of the strain Miass519 was closer to .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/862573 doi: bioRxiv preprint the isolate JMTV/I.ricinus/France then to Miass527. This data suggests that reassortment of genome segments within ALSV could occur. Similar observations were made earlier for JMTV (Qin et al., 2014) .\n\nChinese strains of ALSV were isolated from mammalian blood samples using Vero (African green monkey) cells (Wang et al., 2019a (Wang et al., , 2019b Previously, it was shown that the virion sizes of JMTV group representatives ranged from 30-35 nm to 70-100 nm (Ladner et al., 2016; Qin et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2019a) . ALSV virions were reported to be enveloped spherical (or nearly spherical) particles with a diameter of approximately 80-100 nm (Wang et al., 2019a) . The size of virions of our strain Miass527 was 40.5\u00b13.7 nm. In transmission electron microscopy, some of the viral particles had electron-dense cores, and could hypothetically be defective virions without genomic RNA (Korboukh et al., 2014) . In addition, we found smaller particles with a diameter of 13.1\u00b12.1 nm, which had either electron-translucent or electron-dense cores. Presumably, they could represent either: a) glycoprotein aggregates, similar to the \"classic\" flavivirus nonstructural protein 1, which is i.e., slightly larger than the small particles that we saw in the same fraction of Miass527-infected .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/862573 doi: bioRxiv preprint cells. In any case, the particles were smaller than the smallest parvovirus virions with a diameter of 18-26 nm (Mi et al., 2019) . Further investigations are needed to clarify the nature of these particles.\n\nAlthough the strain Miass527 of ALSV did not differ in overall genome structure from the previously isolated ALSV (Wang et al., 2019a) , the newly-obtained data allowed us to propose a novel protein encoded by both ALSV and JMTV and, probably, by some other members of the JMTV group. The nuORF, proposed here, is conserved in all the full segment 2 sequences of ALSV, JMTV and Yanngou virus available at the time of writing. Considering that ALSV and JMTV are somewhat distantly related (around 70% nucleotide identity and around In conclusion, we isolated three strains of ALSV from I. persulcatus ticks in Russia.\n\nAlthough these strains were isolated from territories far from each other, in phylogenetic analysis they formed a single monophyletic group with the virus isolated in China. Our study confirmed the value of tick cell lines in virus isolation and maintenance of persistent infection. Availability of these novel ALSV strains has enabled better understanding of the phylogenetic relationships within the JMTV group, and will facilitate further study of the origins, structure, replication, .

Ticks were identified using taxonomic keys (Filippova, 1997 (Filippova, , 1977 .\n\nAdult ticks were homogenised in pools of 3-5 individuals according to species composition, location, and route of collection using the laboratory homogeniser TissueLyser II (QIAGEN, Germany) in Medium 199 supplemented with Earle's salts (FSBSI Chumakov FSC R&D IBP RAS, Russia) and antibiotics. All homogenates were tested for the presence of flavivirus RNA using a heminested RT-PCR and primers targeting a conserved region of the flavivirus NS5 gene, as described earlier (Scaramozzino et al., 2001) .\n\nWe used a cell line derived from embryos of the tick I. ricinus \u2212 IRE/CTVM19 (Bell-Sakyi et al., 2007) provided by the Tick Cell Biobank. The tick cell line was maintained at 28 \u00b0\u0421 in L-15 (Leibovitz) medium (FSBSI Chumakov FSC R&D IBP RAS, Russia) supplemented with 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and antibiotics as described earlier (Weisheit et al., 2015) . Prior to infection, IRE/CTVM19 cells were seeded in flat-sided culture tubes (Nunc, ThermoFisher Scientific) in 2.2 ml of complete medium and incubated at 28 \u00b0C. A week later, cells were infected by adding 200 \u03bc l of virus-containing material (unfiltered tick homogenate or culture supernate) and incubated at 28 \u00b0\u0421. Medium was changed at fortnightly intervals by removal and replacement of 1.5 ml; the spent medium was used to harvest the virus as described below. Occasional subcultures were carried out at intervals between 1 month and >1 year by adding 2.2ml of fresh medium, resuspending the tick cells and transferring half of the cell suspension to a new culture tube.\n\nFor transmission electron microscopy and high-throughput sequencing, infected cell culture supernate (spent medium) was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C using an SW-28 rotor in an Optima L-90K Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, USA) and was then ultracentrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 6 h at 4 \u00b0C using the same rotor. Uninfected cell culture supernate was prepared similarly for transmission electron microscopy.\n\n.

A portion of the dissolved pellet was applied to a sucrose density gradient (15-60%) and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 4 h at 4\u00b0C using an SW-40 rotor in the Optima L-90K Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, USA). To identify resultant density gradient fractions containing virus particles, aliquots of each fraction were subjected to RT-PCR and sequencing of amplified products as described below.\n\nThe specimens after ultracentrifugation were adsorbed onto Formvar film attached to 200-mesh nickel EM grids and contrasted with 2% uranyl acetate (Nikitin et al., 2015) . The grids were exposed to UV light for one hour to inactivate the virus, air-dried and examined in a JEOL JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 80 kV. Images were acquired with an Olympus Quemesa digital camera using iTEM software (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions GmbH, Munster, Germany).\n\nViral RNA from tick suspensions and culture supernate of infected cells was isolated with TRI Reagent LS (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was performed with random hexamer primers (R6) and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Viral genomic cDNA was amplified by PCR using specific primers MiassF and MiassR (Supplementary file 2) .\n\nSequencing was carried out in both directions directly from PCR-amplified DNA on the ABI PRISM 3730 (Applied Biosystems) sequencer using ABI PRISM\u00ae BigDye\u2122 Terminator v. 3.1.\n\nGenomic sequences were assembled using SeqMan software (DNAstar, USA).\n\nTotal RNA from an ultracentrifugation pellet was fragmented and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with R6 primers using RevertAid reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific) followed by second strand synthesis with the NEBNext Ultra II Non-Directional RNA Second Strand Synthesis Module (New England Biolabs Inc.

Raw reads were quality-controlled using FaQCs v2.09 (Lo and Chain, 2014) and assembled into contigs using SPAdes v3.13.0 (Bankevich et al., 2012) with iontorrent flag. The resultant contigs were screened for viral sequences using Blastn algorithm in BLAST v2.9.0+ with nt database and contigs corresponding to virus were extracted for further investigation.\n\nRNA sequences of all published strains of ALSV, representatives of the JMTV group and the three strains described in this article were used in the phylogenetic analysis. The nucleotide sequences of the genome coding region of segment 2 were aligned using Clustal-X 2.0.11. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using the neighbour-joining method using MEGA 6.0 with 1000 bootstrap replications.\n\nFor the analysis we used sequences of the full segment 2 of ALSV, JMTV and Yanggou virus extracted from GenBank (08.11.19), as well as sequences of the ALSV strains obtained in the present study (Supplementary file 9). Sequences were divided into three groups (named \"JMTV\", \"ALSV\" and Yanggou virus) based on their positions in the phylogenetic tree (Supplementary file 10). Sequences obtained in the current study were included in the ALSV alignment.\n\nAnalyses of Yanggou virus, ALSV and JMTV were performed separately, because of a low level of similarity between them. Nucleotide sequences of the ORF VP1a (in the case of ALSV and Yanggou virus) and VP1 (in the case of JMTV) were extracted from the full segments. The resultant sequences were codon-aligned using the online tool \u00abCodon Alignment v2.1.0\u00bb (available at https://hcv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/CodonAlign/codonalign.html) with default parameters. The resultant codon alignments were used as an input for the Synplot2 (Firth, 2014) online tool (available at http://guinevere.otago.ac.nz/cgi-bin/aef/synplot_c.pl) v. 2014-12-05/03:10:08 with default parameters (no reference sequence, n=12 (sliding window of 25 codons)).\n\nPutative N-glycosylation sites were predicted using the NetNGlyc 1.0 Server (available online at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/) with a standard set of parameters (Gupta et al., 2004) .
