{"title": "On the Dark Side of Therapies with Immunoglobulin Concentrates: The Adverse Events", "body": "Since the initial clinical use of immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrates of human origin, transmission of pathogens and non-infectious adverse events (AEs) were reported (1\u20137). Before the mid 90s, transmission of pathogens depended on the pool size and the fractionation methods used, particularly the polishing steps of an IgG concentrate (8). Mode of fractionation, i.e., cold-ethanol or ion-exchange chromatography, contaminants, route of application, i.e., intra muscular (IMIG), intravenous (IVIG), or subcutaneous (SCIG), the rate of increase of the exogenous IgG in the circulation of the recipient over time and, last but not least an eventually existing risk factor from patients\u2019 side (Figure 1) as well as incorrect handling of the concentrate are factors having a role in inducing non-infectious AEs related to administration of IgG concentrates (Table 1). IgG concentrates represent a defined part of the adaptive immune system, are isolated from pooled human plasma of at least 1000 donors, which contribute to the repertoire diversity in the final product. Therapies with IgG concentrates manufactured according to regulators requirements are acknowledged to be safe in general. This does not exclude the occurrence of AEs which in their majority are rare and clinically mild to moderate. Below, we like to give a few insights into various aspects and possible mechanisms of AEs.\n\nManufacturing of modern IgG concentrates has to occur in a regulatory framework and the quality standards implemented by the plasma fractionating industry (Figure 2). The cornerstone of the regulatory framework is current good manufacturing practice (cGMP). A pillar of pathogen safety is the validation of virus inactivation and virus elimination methods by validating an already performed step of the fractionation process or by introduction of dedicated steps (Figure 3). A hallmark of virus elimination introduced in the late 90s in Berne by the team of Christoph Kempf is the large-scale virus filtration technique (formerly also termed \u201cnanofiltration\u201d) (8). Meanwhile, virus filtration became a versatile tool to eliminate a variety of pathogens, the suspected agent of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease included. Thanks to the tightly implemented regulatory framework, pathogen safety of plasma products is at a level never reached before. This is well supported by the fact of reports missing in the last decade of transmission by IgG concentrates of emerging viruses (SARS coronavirus, West Nile Virus, MERS coronavirus, and others), zoonotic pathogens, or the agent of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). Furthermore, the development of specific mass screening techniques might help to eradicate in any blood product the transmission of vCJD in the future (9).\n\nThe first reports of rapid onset AEs concerned either the application of complement-activating fractions in an IgG concentrate or the in vivo formation of complement-activating ICs (2\u20134). A very rare but potentially fatal condition is the formation of IgA/anti-IgA complexes in patients being initiated on replacement therapy and having serum IgG antibodies against infused IgA not recognized before the start of the IVIG infusion (32). Prerequisite for the presence of anti-IgA antibodies is the most common primary immunoglobulin defect, i.e., selective IgA deficiency (sIgAD) or IgAD associated with diminution of other immunoglobulin classes. IgAD is defined by serum levels of <0.05 or <0.07 g/L (depending on laboratories). A marked diminution of serum IgA consistent with IgAD in various ethnic groups is estimated being 1:155 to 1:18,550 (33). The mean frequency in Caucasians is approximately 1:700 (34). Up to 40% of patients with IgAD have been reported having anti-IgA antibodies in the serum with titers ranging between 1:4 and 1:262,144. In approximately 10% of patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), and occasionally in patients with other primary immunodeficiency diseases, measurable anti-IgA can be detected (35, 36). These antibodies are predominantly of the IgG class, but anti-IgA antibodies of other immunoglobulin classes have been described as well (37, 38). The reason for their emergence remains unknown.\n\nTaken the above numbers, the infusion of human-derived products containing IgA resulting in severe anaphylactoid type AEs should be considerable. This is not the case (39). Questions about the clinical relevance of above numbers emerge as soon as blood banks (i) estimate the theoretical risk of IgA anaphylactic reactions (32); (ii) assess the relation of severe IgAD with the presence or absence of anti-IgA antibodies (40); (iii) screen donors for very low IgA levels in order to become able to provide blood and plasma-derived products free of IgA and find a considerably lower frequency than expected (41). Alternatively, the test systems may not reliably detect anti-IgA antibodies being as yet insensitive and inaccurate or \u2013 at least \u2013 do not correspond to the clinically relevant fraction of antibodies. This comes to mind when a more close look to \u201canti-IgA\u201d gives \u201cunexpected\u201d results, including \u201canti-IgA\u201d in blood donors with normal serum IgA level or \u201canti-IgA\u201d that cannot be neutralized with purified IgA (42); or when blood products containing proven anti-IgA do not elicit severe AEs (43).\n\nAmong patients on replacement therapy, those with CVID may rarely develop severe immediate AEs (32). The discrepancy between anti-IgA positive patients and frequency of AEs raises the question about the nature of the many reported anti-IgA antibodies and also raises the question about the immunologic condition which allows the formation of anaphylactoid anti-IgA antibodies. There might be some logic in supposing that anaphylactoid anti-IgA cannot evolve at IgA levels otherwise fulfilling the definition of IgAD. Such a condition would constantly generate ICs which in turn could activate complement, react with immune cells, and be deposited in lung and kidney. Indeed, Horn et al. found anti-IgA antibodies in CVID patients missing IgA+ B cells and presenting with IgA levels <0.0009 g/L, a level which is more than 50- to 70-fold lower than the threshold for IgAD (44). However, a possibility for an IgA-mediated anaphylactoid reaction at measurable IgA serum levels might exist. Serum IgA contains approximately 85% subclass 1 of IgA (IgA1) and only 15% subclass 2 of IgA (IgA2). Selective deficiency of IgA2 and \u2013 although evidence is lacking \u2013 the presence of a highly specific anti-IgA2 antibody theoretically could elicit a severe AE.\n\nThe kinetics of anti-IgA after infusion of blood products have been studied in a few cases. In these patients, a fall in anti-IgA titers has been noticed followed by an increase during subsequent weeks or months. This suggests that at appropriate proportions, IgA of the infused material and anti-IgA present in the patients\u2019 serum combine with each other to form ICs. In turn, ICs activate complement that are bound and eliminated by macrophages most likely leading to cytokine release. The increase in anti-IgA titers over time indicates that the infused IgA-containing product has a booster effect (36, 37, 45). Such boosting effect together with the presence of anti-IgA before the application of an IgG concentrate can be taken as the ultimate confirmation of a supposed IgA/anti-IgA reaction. Figure 4 depicts a well-documented case of IgA/anti-IgA reaction in a patient who progressed from sIgAD to CVID. The events during the first 12 h at occasion of the first infusion of IVIG were as follows (shadowed area in Figure 4): 2 min after the start of the infusion, having received eight drops of an IgG solution (IgA < 1.2 g/L; 3% solution), she experienced a flush, back pain, rigors, difficulty in breathing, and hypotension. The infusion was immediately stopped. After approximately 1 h, the reaction has weaned, and 2 h later the patient felt well again, and the infusion of total 6 g IgG could be continued without further complications. Although the patient fairly assured having never received any blood or plasma product in the past, the follow-up of her anti-IgA titers from before infusion to 1 year later confirmed a true anaphylactoid reaction mediated by anti-IgA, as the anti-IgA became undetectable immediately after the infusion and showed a boosting phenomenon during the following months. True anaphylactoid reaction was further confirmed by follow-up of total complement hemolytic activity (CH50) on the day of infusion. Interestingly enough, the CH50 value reached its nadir at the end of the infusion when the patient had no complains. Although a single case only, the events during the first infusion call for the following remarks: (i) severe AEs most likely occur at concomitant complement and cell activation with cytokine release; (ii) infusion of minute to low amounts of IVIG hours before the main infusion can \u201canergize\u201d cells and stop release of pro-inflammatory cytokines; (iii) \u201canergized\u201d cells loose reactivity toward ongoing formation of ICs and complement activation products.\n\nA non-complement-mediated anaphylactoid reaction was ascribed to the unforeseen release of elastase and other pro-inflammatory substances from neutrophils activated by the formation of in vivo IgA/anti-IgA complexes. Complement activation or mast cell-dependent release of vasoactive substances was excluded as pathogenic mechanisms. Although the IgA/anti-IgA complexes usually do not cause clinically relevant neutrophil degranulation within the circulation, the presence of a rare genotype encoding a novel gain-of-function IgG receptor on neutrophils may provoke premature degranulation by these complexes. This phenomenon was only relevant in hypogammaglobulinemic patients in the presence of in vivo IgA/anti-IgA complexes (46). The low prevalence of this genotype combined with an IgAD or CVID may add how to explain the rarity of serious anaphylactoid reactions in newly IVIG-treated patients. Authors share the opinion of Janne Bj\u00f6rkander who at occasion of a discussion panel \u201cDilemmas in Diagnosis and Management of Antibody Deficiencies: Ask the Experts\u201d held at occasion of the 58th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI), New York City, March 1\u20136, 2002 came to the following conclusion: a clinician has to be aware of the risk, particularly at occasion of first infusions, but otherwise IgA is not a major concern (from tape record).\n\nIn the early days of Ig-therapy, the nature of the \u201cphlogistic\u201d AEs was obscure. However, it was already known that an AE can be prevented or its evolution halted when the patient receives a low dose of IVIG first or the infusion is stopped early and is continued several hours later. Hours later the infusion can be (re)started at high rates without further problems (Figure 5). One of the authors had a particular opportunity to get an insight into what a \u201cphlogistic reaction\u201d might be. At the occasion of a voluntary infusion of an investigational liquid IVIG, he encountered a severe flu-like AE of more than 12 h duration. Before injection, the investigational liquid preparation had passed all release criteria for human use, including spontaneous complement activation assessed by ACA and was free of prekallikrein activator (PKA). In those days, assays for cytokines in biological samples just began to become available and were included into the parameters assessed in the study. Infusion was stopped after 1 h because of a drop of pulse rate and heavy discomfort provoking the laconic comment by the proband\u2019s technician who was taking samples: \u201cyou look green.\u201d The infusion was continued after another 90 min when the heart rate had almost normalized. The infusion could be completed within an additional 3.25 h (a total of 0.4 g/kg b.w.) without further aggravation of malaise. The leukocyte count transiently had dropped to a nadir of 40% at 2 h followed by a leukocytosis peak at 8 h. Complement activation, as assessed by generation of C3a/C3a[desArg] and the formation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9, apparently did not occur: the C3a/C3a[desArg] value reached a maximum of 260 ng/mL (norm: <200 ng/mL) at 7 h while the C5b-9 value never moved outside the normal range. Instead, a sequence of rapid transient massive increases of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed: (i) TNF\u03b1 started to increase 30 min post initiation of infusion from a value of 20 pg/mL to a peak value at 2 h which was above the calibration range of the test kit of 1500 pg/mL; (ii) interleukin 8 (IL-8) increase started after 1 h from 29 pg/mL and peaked at 2.5 h with 4400 pg/mL post initiation of infusion; (iii) interleukin 6 (IL-6) secretion started after 1 h with an undetectable level and peaked at 4 h with 345 pg/mL. All pro-inflammatory cytokines fell sharply while the second part of the infusion was still ongoing. The day after infusion, the pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles were back to normal and the flu-like syndrome was gone. In contrast, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) values started increasing at 1.5 h (300 pg/mL), peaked at 4 h (>32,000 pg/mL), and decreased slowly to reach a value of 10,500 pg/mL 24 h after initiation of the infusion. Soluble TNF receptor p75 level started at 2.25 ng/mL, reached a peak with 16.5 ng/mL at the same time as IL-1ra, and 24 h after initiation of infusion was still at 10.5 ng/mL. Thus, in this normogammaglobulinemic subject similar cytokine profiles and leukocyte number changes were observed as reported for hypogammagobulinemia under replacement therapy (47, 48).\n\nA series of further experiments with investigational and marketed IVIGs was performed. All IgG concentrates were analyzed for their molecular weight (MW) distribution. The most remarkable differences emerged in the MW range of dimers while the presence of minute amounts of higher oligomers could not be excluded with certainty. Below, we will use the term \u201cdimers\u201d for that fraction of IgG with higher MW. Subsequent findings indicated that levels of \u201cdimers\u201d >12% were responsible for complement-independent cell activation and cytokine release. The TNF\u03b1 peaks assessed at 2.5 h post initiation of infusions correlated with \u201cdimer\u201d content of the IVIGs and mirrored a clinical score of AEs (49\u201351).\n\nA few years before a complement-independent induction of a hypotensive factor by IgG di- and oligomers was reported in animal experiments (52). A key role for macrophages in the generation of the hypotensive lipid factor was identified as platelet-activating factor, being induced by dimers and polymers (53, 54). Several years later, the dimer-mediated AEs in animal experiments were confirmed (55, 56). Yet, at the same time, the dimer content of IVIG apparently correlated with the clinical efficacy in a murine ITP model (55, 57). Variables such as \u201cIR,\u201d \u201cgenetic background,\u201d \u201cendogenous immunoglobulin levels,\u201d or \u201cproportional fraction of polymers versus dimers\u201d may impact on the balance between the phlogiston (being cytokines, active lipid substances, or a combination of factors) and the therapeutic efficacy (blocking IgG receptors on liver/spleen macrophages to prevent clearance of \u201copsonized\u201d material such as platelets in ITP). As of today, reports on release of cytokines in humans in association with AEs or tolerability toward dimers remain scarce and to the best of our knowledge studies in humans of causative factors/fraction in an IgG concentrate has not been adequately addressed (47, 48, 58\u201361).\n\nIn IgG preparations, various forms of dimers might be present: formed through covalent binding (62) by denaturation, hydrophobic interactions of the Fc-parts, and by idiotype/anti-idiotype interactions, as part of the V-connected network of peripheral immune homeostasis (63). For a commercially viable fractionation process, pooling of donated plasma is mandatory in order to obtain a volume of starting material large enough to cover ever increasing costs for documentation, in-process, and batch-release testing as it is required by cGMP. Pooling also intends smoothing the batch-to-batch differences in antibody titers, a goal apparently difficult to achieve to levels as theory might imply (64). Consequences of pooling are on the one hand the enrichment of public/common immune antibodies while diluting out individual specificities; on the other hand, the antibodies of the immune network of an individual donor are exposed to those of many other donors. The more individuals contribute to the pool, the more complex the possible \u201cimmune-network\u201d interactions among IgA, IgG, and IgM will become. The subsequent fractionation process has far-reaching effects on immunoglobulins from a given pool: only trace amounts of IgA and IgM are retained in the final product, i.e., IgG is deprived of its counterparts of the V-connected immune network. The IgG molecules of the homeostatic network \u201cnaked\u201d at their V-regions can interact with each other at random combining site-interactions of single donor-derived monomeric IgG (65), otherwise not existing in vivo. This interaction is largely reversible. With increasing numbers of donors included into the pool, the immune network recognition among the \u201cnaked\u201d IgG molecules of the V-connected network becomes more and more complex, and the dimer and lower oligomer content in the resulting IgG concentrate increases (66\u201368). In lyophilized IgG concentrates, the dimer formation is \u201cfrozen\u201d at a low level while in liquid preparations an equilibrium between monomers and dimers is achieved over time reaching a dimer content of 12% or more if not hampered by stabilizers. Specificities, as far as they have been addressed, in the dimer fraction considerably differ from the monomeric fraction (69\u201373). In conclusion, the immunomodulatory efficacy of IgG concentrates in part depends on the capacity and extent to form \u201cdimer\u201d fractions devoid of remarkable complement activation in vivo. The \u201cart\u201d of manufacturing a liquid IgG concentrate is not to eliminate the monomeric IgG having potential for \u201cdimer\u201d formation but to inhibit extensive \u201cdimerization.\u201d In summary, AEs might be associated with the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in absence of measurable complement activation in vivo where all regulatory mechanisms and removal processes of a body are at disposition. At reasonable IRs in the open system of the human body, clinically relevant systemic complement activation apparently needs oligomers formed of three or more IgG molecules.\n\nWith the detection of the immunomodulatory potential of IgG concentrates, their clinical use has continuously increased (123). To cover the need, at a first glance, an increase of the volume of plasma fractionated seems to be the most convenient option. However, this might economically not be viable because fractionation of plasma products is interconnected (124) and before increasing output of one product (e.g., IVIG), the market absorbance of the other products as well (e.g., albumin) must be ascertained. On a longer-run, a more viable option is to improve recovery. Considering recovery, the cold-ethanol fractionation apparently has reached its limits. As of today, four manufactures have invested into a \u201cmodern\u201d fractioning technique on the basis of ion-exchange chromatography. Ion-exchange chromatography allows elevated recovery at high purity. As of today, five IVIGs, one SCIG, and one anti-D concentrate are fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography. Pharmacovigilance has shown that all chromatographically fractionated IVIG and SCIG, more or less prominently, show a tendency for elevated frequencies of hemolytic AEs. Anti-A and anti-B alloantibody titers are now lot-release criteria (see above) as they constitute the major risk parameter for hemolytic reactions mediated by IgG concentrates. To overcome the threat of end up on the dark side of the moon, two manufacturers have taken measures to reduce anti-A and anti-B titers in their IgG products. One measure chosen was adsorption of the alloantibodies by affinity chromatography (125). Reported reduction in both alloantibodies was significant and levels were similar to those in cold-ethanol fractionated immunoglobulins (126). The other measure chosen was reduction in anti-A using an automated indirect agglutination test for donor screening and exclusion of high-titer donations (approximately 5.1%) from plasma pooling and fractionation (127). This measure reduced anti-A in the IgG concentrate by one titer step. To ensure staying on the safe and sunny side, the manufacturer has announced the introduction of an alloanti-A and alloanti-B immune-affinity chromatography step into the manufacturing process (128). Preliminary results indicate depletion in anti-A and anti-B by >80% in investigational lots. Subsequently, we want to discuss possible consequences of (extensive) removal of antibodies reacting with histo-blood group antigens A and B.\n\nThree facts have initiated our thinking about possible consequences of removal of histo-blood group A and B reacting antibodies from IgG concentrates. (I) In collaboration with Hans U. Lutz, formerly Biochemistry ETH Zurich, we have observed the non-intended removal of natural anti-C3 autoantibodies regulating complement activation by large-scale immune-affinity adsorption of IgA from an IgG concentrate (129). Anti-C3 antibodies belong to the family of \u201cNAbs\u201d and have a particular role in homeostasis: they control activation of complement, among others, in the frame of NAb-mediated opsono-phagocytosis of altered or senescent cells, including RBCs (130\u2013132). Thus, the intention to target one particular antibody by affinity chromatography might reduce that antibody specificity but at the same time affect other specificities as well. (II) It should be kept in mind that the blood groups A and B are in fact \u201chisto-blood group\u201d antigens, i.e., they are also found on white blood cells, T lymphocytes, and proteins and also can be found in soluble form (133). Alloantibodies reacting with histo-blood group antigens A and B thus have much broader tissue recognition than RBCs only. In addition, alloanti-A and alloanti-B belong to the population of NAbs recognizing non-self and most likely participate in primary host defense (134). (III) In contrast to cold-ethanol fractionation, where low titers of alloanti-A and alloanti-B are achieved on basis of their isoelectric points (IEPs), the (extensive) immune-affinity removal might affect a much wider IEP range, thereby removing broadly reacting antibodies and impairing some desirable functions of the IgG concentrate. Thus, the struggle for staying on the sunny side of the moon might have consequences for the antibody repertoire in an IgG concentrate.\n\nAntibodies reacting with terminal di-, tri-, and tetra-saccharides belong to the large family of human anti-glycan NAbs. Histo-blood group A and B epitopes in terminal position are tetra-saccharides. Alloantibodies to these tetra-saccharides are found in the plasma of healthy individuals depending on the blood group they have. A considerable body of research into the nature of these NAbs has been performed so far, all using for isolation the corresponding terminal di- or tri-saccharides (135\u2013137). Recently, the repertoire and epitope specificity of such immunoglobulins was addressed in depth by including the tetra-saccharide as well (138, 139). It proved that serum of healthy individuals contain respectable amounts of di- or tri-saccharide-reacting NAbs. These NAbs proved to be pseudo-anti-A and pseudo-anti-B NAbs as they are not reacting with the tetra-saccharide of histo-blood groups A and B. In contrast, alloanti-A and -B antibodies able to react with tetra-saccharides are reacting with the corresponding terminal di- and tri-saccharides. Reasoning about the biological role of these \u201chigh-titer and population conservative\u201d anti-di- and anti-tri-saccharide NAbs and the consequence of their potential removal by immunoaffinity is outlined below.\n\nA population of the anti-glycan NAbs are the anti-\u03b1Gal NAbs which recognize Gal\u03b11-3Gal and Gal\u03b11-3(Fuc\u03b11-2)Gal epitopes. Anti-\u03b1Gal NAbs have been described being xenoreactive, recognizing bacterial Gal\u03b11-3Gal (140) and having tissue homeostatic function. The daily removal of altered/senescent cells of the body is ~1012. Removal is mainly mediated by apoptosis (no inflammation, no necrosis). RBCs, when they do not encounter a pathological condition, over their life span of 100\u2013120 days remain intact although they shrink, do not undergo apoptosis but progressively become senescent, mainly due to cumulative oxidative stress. Removal of intact RBCs with a daily turnover of ~2 \u00d7 1011, corresponding to ~20 g cell mass, is effectuated by increased exposure of otherwise cryptic structures such as spectrin, band 3, or \u03b1Gal epitopes. These exposed structures are recognized by low affinity, high avidity, C3-bearing NAbs, which promote the efficient removal of intact senescent RBCs (130, 141, 142). Immunoaffinity adsorption by tri-saccharides columns of di- and tri-saccharide reacting NAbs from IgG concentrates can eliminate anti-histo-blood A and B alloantibodies while it also eliminates \u03b1Gal and this might have a Janus effect. The face directed to the sun tells that adsorbing \u03b1Gal NAbs reacting with altered and senescent self on RBC might prevent an increase in the IgG load of RBCs over the threshold level of relevant hemolysis in individuals at risk. The face directed to the dark indicate that adsorption of tissue homeostatic antibodies might deprive an IgG concentrate of potentially beneficial antibodies. Although they are NAbs, tri-saccharide reacting antibodies can be induced by feeding bacteria bearing the corresponding carbohydrate epitopes (134). These inducible NAbs are considered to participate in primary host defense. Other antibodies possibly involved in primary host defense are the anti-\u03b1Gal NAbs. They show a broad specificity and can react with a number of related \u03b1Gal-terminated oligosaccharides, including those on bacteria (143). Thus, the immunoadsorption of di-and tri-saccharide reacting NAbs might diminish the potential of an IgG concentrate to mediate primary host defense. Therefore, when choosing affinity resins for immunoadsorption, there might be some aspects worth to consider.\n\nIn summary, the principles of avoiding co-fractionation through cold-ethanol fractionation (144) versus immune-affinity removal of histo-blood group alloantibodies can have an impact on the presence of homeostatic and first-line defense antibodies. According to present knowledge, only resins coated with the corresponding tetra-saccharides can ascertain the selective removal of histo-blood group alloantibodies presumably involved in HA. Resins coated with the corresponding di- and tri-saccharides also remove blood group alloantibodies, however not selectively. Such resins in addition might remove a broad range of NAbs present in IgG concentrates at relative high amounts. In the literature, the use of tri-saccharide-coated resin was reported (145\u2013147). We have found no information available in the public domain indicating which type of resin is/will be used for reduction of the histo-blood group alloantibodies in large-scale fractionation of IgG. Furthermore, we suggest that the effect of reduction of anti-A and ant-B reacting antibodies by immune-affinity on the antibody repertoire of IgG concentrates can only be assessed by, e.g., using pathogens/commensals, which share the saccharide epitopes, that have been used to coat the affinity resins or alternatively by exposing senescent RBCs stripped off the IgGs coated in vivo. Finally, techniques are required, which allow detection of low affinity, high avidity NAbs.\n\nIVIG administration-related AEs, including thrombosis, have been extensively described (148). Thrombotic AEs are severe AEs and patients with risk factors require a special care. Reported average incidence of IVIG-induced thrombosis ranges from 3 to 13% (149). Recognized risk factors for IVIG-induced thrombosis include male gender; age >60; diabetes; renal insufficiency, dyslipidemia; hypertension; immobility; coronary disease; pre-existing vascular disease, family history of early thromboembolic disease; atrial fibrillation, high-dose and high-speed IVIG infusions. IVIG-induced thrombosis is reported both as venous events such as thrombosis stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and arterial ischemia events such as myocardial infarct and stroke. The mechanisms leading to IVIG-associated thrombosis are still not completely clear; three main mechanisms have been proposed, emphasizing the role of an increased blood viscosity causing a hypercoagulable state (150), the role of anticardiolipin antibodies passively transferred through IVIG (151), and the role of factor XIa or other biologically highly active factors passively transferred via IgG concentrates, such as PKA. Avoiding activated coagulation factors in IgG concentrates starts with appropriate anticoagulation of donated blood/plasma, i.e., careful mixing of anticoagulant and sample over the whole donation process. Alterations in an established manufacturing process neglecting appropriate controls can also lead to increased risk of transmission of activated coagulation factors. High MW proteins passively transferred by IVIG are probably contributing to this phenomenon (152). In patients with other risk factors, such as vascular disease, the increase in blood viscosity can precipitate thromboembolic events. As elderly individuals are prone for such AEs, we like to point to the possibility of elevated altered/senescent self-reacting with infused homeostatic NAbs being a possible factor facilitating thrombotic events as well. A relationship between IVIG administration and cerebral vasospasm has also been suggested by Sztajzel et al. (153); blood viscosity is a determinant for oxygen delivery to the tissues, and changes in viscosity can lead to a reduction in cerebral or myocardial perfusion.\n\nWe systematically reviewed case reports related to IVIG-induced thrombosis from 1986 to 2014 (Figure 8). Literature search identified 35 articles containing reports concerning 65 patients (6, 24, 149, 154\u2013183). When data were available, diagnosis, risk factors, the number of IVIG infusion prior to thrombosis event, and outcome have been indicated. Baseline characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 3. High-dose IVIG induced thromboembolic events in 59 patients at low to medium IVIG doses. Marie et al. (163) observed that the frequency and type of arterial events was inversely related to the time elapsed from IVIG infusion; almost 50% (23 versus 21 reports) of arterial ischemic events occurred within 12 h following IVIG, while about 75% of venous thrombosis occurred after more than 24 h. No correlation between number of infusions and occurrence of AE was observed. The main risk factors observed in this review were hypertension (19 cases, 33% of prevalence), previous vascular disease (18%), and dyslipidemia (17%). Average mortality for thrombotic events was 10% (arterial ischemia 9% versus venous thrombosis 11%, PE representing the main venous fatal event). Predicting IVIG-induced thrombosis is difficult. Risk factors should be assessed for each patient including instrumental exams when needed. Doppler ultrasound can be useful as early diagnostic tool for thrombosis or to detect the presence of abnormal blood flow especially after prolonged immobility. IVIG should be administered at low IR to reduce the risk. The administration of antiplatelet or anticoagulant prophylaxis was suggested in patients with several risk factors (162). However, thrombotic events have been reported even after several previous uncomplicated courses of treatment. In such cases, patients should be examined for signs and symptoms of thrombosis during each courses of IVIG.\n\nImmunoglobulin G concentrates are widely acknowledged to offer a safe, high-dose, long-term therapy option for a variety of diseases. AEs occur rarely and mainly are mild to moderate. Deviations from this rule of thumb are addressed by authorities and the plasma fractionation industry to achieve corrections. Above, we have reviewed two types of AE which have shown elevated frequency in the near past. We tried to give some insights which might help in reducing frequencies of AEs bed side.\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
