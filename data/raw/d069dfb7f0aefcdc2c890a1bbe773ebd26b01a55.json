As of February 10th, 2020, 37,626 laboratory-confirmed cases and 1016 death cases have been documented in China.\n\nPragmatic effectiveness trials are increasingly recognized as an essential component of medical evidence and good prediction models can help formulate scientific prevention and treatment programs 4, 5 .\n\nIn the recent past, two other novel coronaviruses (CoVs), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV; in 2002) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV; in 2012) have emerged, and the world is placed on high alert 6, 7 . They have similar symptoms, while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have low potential for sustained community transmission 8 . Infections and deaths of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are less than 2019-nCoV, thus the previous prediction model is no longer suitable for 2019-nCoV 9 .\n\nIn this study, we provide State Transition Matrix Model to predict the 2019-nCoV infection peak and patient distribution. More importantly, from a public health viewpoint, we then estimate the risk metrics (infectivity, severity and lethality) of the NCP. We set up six different scenarios, in order to control for model error. So, we can identify the close contact/patient's state by utilizing a state vector at any moment.\n\nMedical observation, discharge, infected, non-Severe, infected and severe, cure and death data and corresponding information released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China from Jan 25, 2019, to Feb 28, 2020 were analyzed.\n\nState transition matrix modeling is a well-regarded approach widely applied in clinical decision analysis based on computer simulation. For estimating the infection peak time and the scale of severe and critical cases in subsequent days, we chose the Markov model cohort simulation. All rights reserved.

Medical Observation (MO) is a close contact of a known infected patient is identified and put into medical observation. In the next day, outcome could be any of the three: confirmed infection, discharged without infection, or stay in MO. Discharge (dis) is a terminal state for a close contact, until he or she becomes another incident of close contact again. Infected is an intermediate state, where the patient becomes a confirmed infected case. The outcome is binary:\n\nsevere, or non-severe. And the outcome is revealed immediately. Non-Severe (INS) is the patient also has three possible outcomes in the next day: cure, severe, or stay in non-severe. Infected and Severe (IS), the patient has three possible outcomes in the next day: death, non-severe, or stay in severe. Cure (Cu) is also a terminal state for the patient. Death (D) is a terminal state for the patient. So, at any moment, we can identify the close contact/patient's state by utilizing a state vector, defined as the following:\n\nWhere each element of the vector stands for one state in the same sequentially All rights reserved.

Please note that infected itself is not an independent state, since the outcome is revealed instantaneously, so we combine Infected with Severe and Non-Severe. Let's define the state transition matrix as the following:\n\nSuppose we have a state vector V(t) for a sample population at time t, how do we predict the state vector V(t+1) in the next day?\n\nApply simple linear algebra, we can get the following equation:\n\nSince the head count of a certain state comes from itself, all other possible transitions into the state (e.g. INS has two possible income states, MO and IS), minus the outcome states (IS, and Cu).\n\nIf we want to predict for N period, the equation becomes the following:\n\nIf the population is limited and the transition matrix is stationary, the above formula will be sufficient in predicting all future outcomes. In our case, the population is not fixed, so we need to introduce the additional input into the population: new close contacts.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We collected supplementary data from Hubei Health Commission. The data period starts from 2019/12/31, and ends on 2020/2/11. Data is updated on a daily basis.\n\nNext, we describe how we estimate these parameters from empirical probabilities.\n\nWe set up six different scenarios, in order to control for model error. Two of the scenarios are very optimistic, two of them are relatively optimistic, and two of them are relatively pessimistickan (Table 1) .\n\nThis decay rate is closely linked to R0 and is directly estimated from empirical data.\n\nThe 8-day average is -6%, but it is volatile, so we will test -1%, -5%, -10% respectively ( Figure 1A ). Since we could not obtain the one-day probability of lifting medical observation in Hubei Province, we used national rate for reference. The latest one-day probability is 17% and the 10-day moving weighted average is 13%.\n\nConsidering that the probability of Hubei Province may be lower than that of the whole country, we test it with 17% and 13%, respectively. ( Figure 1B) . In Hubei Province, the latest one-day probability of transition from medical observation to confirmed infection is 2.15%, with a weighted average of 3.94% over the last 10 days, ending at 2/11. As this probability continues to decline, we use the average (3.04%) of these two values as our model parameter to be cautiously optimistic ( Figure 1C ). The latest single-day mortality rate was 0.33% and the 10-day moving weighted average was 0.41%. As this probability continues to decline, we use the average (0.37%) of these two values as our model parameter to be cautiously optimistic ( Figure 1D ). The latest one-day cure rate is 1.46% and the 10-day moving weighted average is 1.27%.\n\nAs this probability continues to decline, we use the average (1.37%) of these two values as our model parameter to be cautiously optimistic ( Figure 1E ).

As these two probabilities continues to fluctuate, we also use the average (17.56%, and 4.82%) of the latest value and 10-day moving weighted average as our model parameters to put more weight on recent observation. ( Figure   1F ). The parameters we use in our forecast are listed in Table 2 .\n\nIn very optimistic scenarios (daily NCC decay rate of -10%), the peak time of open inflection cases will arrive around February 23-February 26. At the same time, there will be a peak in the numbers of severely ill and critically ill patients, between 6800-7200 and 1800-2000, respectively (Figure 2A and 2B) . In a relative optimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -5%), the inflection case peak time will arrive around February 28-March 2. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 7100-7800 and 1900-2200, respectively ( Figure 2C and 2D) . In a relatively pessimistic scenario (daily NCC decay rate of -1%), the inflection peak time does not arrive around the end of March. Estimated time is March 25 -April 2. The numbers of critically ill and critically ill patients will lie between 8300-9800 and 2200-2700, respectively ( Figure 2E and 2F) . We are using parameters with 50% weight on the diagnosis rate, mortality rate, cure rate as of 2/11. There should be room for improvement, if these metrics continue to improve. In that case, the peak time will arrive earlier than our estimation. Also, the severe and critical case ratios are likely to decline as the virus becomes less toxic and medical conditions improve. If that happens, the peak numbers will be lower than predicted above ( Figure 2G and 2H ).\n\nThe parameters we use in our forecast are listed in Table 2 .\n\nIn Hubei Province, since the outbreak of 2019-nCoV and the determination of human-to-human transmission, it has spread to all over China and even the world 10 .\n\nThe growth trend of its cases is exponential during the epidemic period, but with the strict implementation of disease prevention and control, the inflection point of case growth will come as scheduled.

The results show that under the existing medical and public health intervention, the Decay Rate of New Close Contacts is 10%, the inflection point of growth will come as early as February 23 (very optimistic), and the attenuation rate is 5% to 3 The beginning of the month (relatively optimistic), and when the decay rate drops to 1%, it will arrive at the latest on April 14 (very pessimistic).\n\nAs the birthplace of the disease, Hubei Province has mountains of confirmed and suspected cases. In order to finally overcome the disease, Hubei Province adopted plenty of even severe measures to restrict population movements, and adopted various strategies, such as prohibiting assembly, delaying school and resumption of work, or working from home, to significantly reduce the internal population contact rate.\n\nAlthough cases have spread throughout China, according to plans developed and implemented during previous major outbreaks such as SARS, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or a pandemic influenza outbreak, Hubei Province has eased intercity transmission through strict disease prevention and control and limits the worst cases to Hubei Province [11] [12] [13] . Persistent and compulsory implementation, as well as the cooperation of the people and the efforts of medical staff, will bring real relief.\n\nThrough the guidance of the inflection point of the epidemic and the distribution of patient status, the government, medical work and tight medical resource allocation will become more efficient and reasonable. Wu, J. T. et al. indicated that it will peak in April with the infection rate staying put; it will reach a peak in May with the infection rate decreasing by 25%,; if the infection rate decreases to 50%, the epidemic will slowly increase in the first half of 2020 and will not reach its peak 9 .\n\nThe difficulty of the current epidemic control is that when these patients were admitted to the hospital, only 43.1% of them were feverish at the time, and more patients had fever during their hospitalization. A recent study showed that 2019-nCoV was detected in stool samples from patients with abdominal symptoms 14 . However, identifying and screening patients with atypical symptoms is difficult 15 .

Therefore, another advantage of this model is that, relative to the new cases, we choose to analyze critical and severe cases, which possess better stability, and the main medical resource consumption group is this group of patients. With the help of our model would optimize the critical medical resources allocation.\n\nAt present, tremendous medical resources are deployed in Wuhan, Hubei. If there is a slight slack in other areas, the prevention and control of the epidemic will be a devastating blow. Community governance is the basis of social governance and the most basic unit of national governance. In the comprehensive prevention and control system formed by the combination of national joint defense and joint control and group defense and group control, the community is an important coupling point, and the social epidemic prevention and protection system must be woven in the community.

Primarily, critical or severe cases will be affected by the gradually rational allocation of treatment teams and medical resources, the strengthening of medical power or virus toxicity decreasing. As a result, the peak time might arrive earlier than our estimates. Secondly, the impact of seasonal factors has not been considered and supposing 2019-nCoV is affected by the season, our prediction results may be unreliable. Hence, if these indicators continue to change, the model could have opportunities for improvement. In addition, due to the characteristics of severe and critical cases, there may be a huge impact on factors such as age and complex underlying diseases. Therefore, with the increasing awareness of the severity of the disease and the strengthening of prevention and control in various sectors of the society, various indicators may be reduced. At the same time, because of the instability of the previous indicators, these dynamic changes may affect the predictive efficacy of the model.\n\nWe can infer that we are still not close to the end of this outbreak and the number of critically ill patients is still climbing. And assisting critical care resources in Hubei province requires the government to consider further tilt, and it is vital to make reasonable management of doctors and medical assistance systems to curb the transmission trend"}
