{"title": "", "body": "To the Editor:\n\nThe recent report, \"Outcome of strict implementation of infection prevention control measures during an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome,\" by El Bushra et al is very interesting. 1 El Bushra et al noted that \"proper institution of infection prevention and control (IPC) measures during management of an outbreak of MERS [Middle East respiratory syndrome] could remarkably change the course of the outbreak. 1 \" We would like to share ideas and experience from Thailand where the disease already existed. There are at least 3 imported cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome in Thailand, and the disease control is successful. All patients were from the Middle East and received early diagnoses for Middle East respiratory syndrome. All patients were treated in the same tertiary hospital with a standard isolation unit. 2 The key factors for success in disease control are early diagnosis, prompt treatment, and sufficient facilities for management of contagious disease. Focusing on prevention of further nosocomial infection to medical personnel, strict infection prevention and control is proven for effectiveness. According to a recent survey on the hospital that was used for management of imported Middle East respiratory syndrome cases, \"all contacts reported 100% compliance with hand hygiene, using N95 respirator, performing respirator fit test, wearing gown, gloves, eye protection, and cap during their entire working period. 3 \" Nevertheless, a big concern is availability of standard ventilation-filtration units for respiratory isolation. Sufficient respiratory isolation units are required. \n\nTo the Editor,\n\nWe read with great interest the recent report by Pinto et al. 1 The authors correctly point out that dental handpieces should be steam sterilized between patient use and provide evidence that external disinfection of dental handpieces with alcohol is unsafe. However, there is a possibility that readers may wrongly assume that there is an ongoing search for a way to safely disinfect these instruments, when surface disinfection or immersion in disinfectant are not acceptable reprocessing methods for dental handpieces.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2003 guidelines state the following: \"Manufacturer's instructions for cleaning, lubrication, and sterilization should be followed closely to ensure both the effectiveness of the process and the longevity of handpieces.\" 2 In 2016, further clarification was made, Dental handpieces and associated attachments, including lowspeed motors and reusable prophylaxis angles, should always be heat sterilized between patients and not high level or surface disinfected. Although these devices are considered semicritical, studies have shown that their internal surfaces can become contaminated with patient materials during use. If these devices are not properly cleaned and heat sterilized, the next patient may be exposed to potentially infectious materials. 3 The authors paid meticulous attention to the surface disinfection protocols. However, they neglected to test the internal components when assessing the level of contamination of the disinfected handpiece. Surgical power tools can be considered the weak link in the decontamination cycle and present a potential for iatrogenic transmission of infection, mainly because their internal complex designs may restrict access to cleaning and sterilization agents. 4 Indeed, after surface disinfection of these dental instruments, the internal turbine mechanism retains blood and saliva, as well as viruses and bacteria. [5] [6] [7] [8] Viable microorganisms could therefore be expelled during subsequent patient treatment, making strict adherence to dental handpiece sterilization a professional imperative.\n\nInstrument sterilization is a cost-effective, evidence-based practice for patient safety. It is true, however, that contrary to the highest safety standards, compliance with handpiece sterilization remain a major challenge for dental education and professional practice worldwide. In a recent survey (2013-2014) among 207 dentists recently graduated from 43 schools of dentistry in Latin America, only 35% declared that they were trained to sterilize handpieces between patients. 9"}
