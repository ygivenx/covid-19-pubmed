{"title": "MUC5AC drives COPD exacerbation severity through amplification of virus-induced airway inflammation", "body": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory airway disorder punctuated by acute exacerbations, frequently precipitated by rhinoviruses (RVs) 1,2 . Exacerbations are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in COPD 3, 4 and a greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms is urgently needed to facilitate development of new therapies to reduce the impact of these debilitating episodes.\n\nRespiratory mucosal surfaces are continuously exposed to inhaled pathogens and a protective layer of secreted mucus that is rich in mucin glycoproteins acts as a first-line of defense against infection. Alterations in mucus secretion including enhancement of the major airway mucins MUC5AC and MUC5B are a cardinal feature of inflammatory airway COPD [5] [6] [7] . The complexity of interactions between mucins and pathogens and how the perturbations in mucin expression that occur in COPD affect infection susceptibility and subsequent exacerbation pathogenesis are poorly understood and it is not known whether inhibition of mucus production would be beneficial or harmful in this context.\n\nAnimal studies have revealed critical roles for MUC5AC and MUC5B in anti-viral and antibacterial host-defense 8, 9 suggesting that use of anti-secretory therapies may compromise a protective role for mucins during exacerbations. Conversely, mucin levels are higher in COPD patients who experience frequent exacerbations 7 raising speculation for a possible functional role in exacerbation pathogenesis. Additionally, accumulation of small airway mucus-containing inflammatory exudates has been shown to be associated with early death in patients with COPD treated by lung volume reduction surgery 10 and airway MUC5AC mediates airway hyperresponsiveness 11 and is over-expressed in cases of fatal asthma 12 , suggesting that mucins could be a marker or cause of adverse outcome. These studies would support the opposing view that targeted suppression of mucins during exacerbations might provide desirable improvement in outcomes.\n\nHere, using human studies in combination with functional experiments in mouse models, we identify a central and unforeseen role for MUC5AC in amplifying virus-induced airway inflammation and driving subsequent exacerbation severity in COPD. We identify a mechanism for augmentation of virus-induced inflammation by MUC5AC through release of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and show that therapeutic suppression of virusinduced MUC5AC release using an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor ameliorates exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses in a mouse COPD exacerbation model.

A total of 27 exacerbations were reported, of which 18 exacerbations (67%) were associated with positive virus detection by PCR of sputum samples (rhinovirus n=11, coronavirus n=4, RSV n=2, influenza n=1) as previously reported. 13 These 18 virus-positive exacerbation samples were used for analyses (see Table 1 for the clinical characteristics of the subjects reporting these 18 exacerbations). Significant increases from baseline were observed for sputum supernatant MUC5AC protein concentrations at exacerbation presentation and at 2 weeks during exacerbation with no significant increase observed for MUC5B protein (Fig.1b) .\n\nDuring exacerbation, peak concentrations of MUC5AC (i.e. maximal concentrations detected during exacerbation) protein were increased compared to baseline with no significant increase observed for MUC5B (Fig.1c) . Frequent exacerbators (patients with a history of >2 exacerbations in the preceding year) had increased sputum MUC5AC concentrations at exacerbation presentation and at 2 weeks during exacerbation compared with infrequent exacerbators (0 or 1 exacerbations in the preceding year), with no significant differences observed for MUC5B (Fig. 1d) .\n\nGiven that ELISA-based quantification of sputum mucins may be influenced by proteases present in this sample type 14 , we further confirmed our observations using quantitative PCR to measure mucin expression in RNA extracted from sputum cells from the same subjects.\n\nIn keeping with our findings for mucin proteins, we also observed that sputum MUC5AC mRNA was significantly increased at exacerbation onset with no increase observed for MUC5B mRNA (Fig 1e) , providing additional evidence that MUC5AC is the major induced mucin during naturally-occurring COPD exacerbations.\n\nWe next utilised our previous human RV challenge studies 1, 15 to more accurately define the temporal dynamics of mucin expression during RV-induced COPD exacerbations ( Fig.2a and Supplementary Fig.1a )(Clinical characteristics of these subjects are shown in Table 2 ). author/funder.

MUC5AC was increased in patients with COPD versus healthy controls on days 3, 9 and 12 post-infection (Fig.2b) . There was no significant change in MUC5B from baseline at any time point in patients with COPD or healthy controls and no difference in MUC5B was observed between these two groups during infection (Supplementary Fig.1b) . MUC5AC peak concentrations were increased in patients with COPD compared to baseline with no significant change observed in healthy individuals and peak MUC5AC concentrations were higher in COPD compared to healthy subjects (Fig.2c) . MUC5B peak concentrations were increased in both groups of volunteers when compared to baseline with no significant difference observed between the two groups ( Supplementary Fig.1c ).\n\nHaving characterised the expression of mucins during exacerbation, and noting that MUC5AC induction occurs at day 3, a time-point that precedes peak airway inflammation, which occurs between days 9 and 15 post-infection 1,15 , we next sought to assess relationships between MUC5AC responses and inflammatory responses to infection in our human experimental challenge model. We observed highly significant positive correlations between sputum MUC5AC and cellular airway inflammation (total cell counts and neutrophil counts, Fig.2d ) and between MUC5AC and concentrations of soluble mediators of inflammation including CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL10/IP-10, IL-1b, GM-CSF IL-6 and TNF (Fig.2d) .\n\nSince virus replication acts as a driver for airway inflammation 1,15 , we also examined relationships between sputum mucins and virus load and found a positive correlation between sputum MUC5AC and sputum virus load (Fig.2e) .\n\nWe have previously reported that rhinovirus infection induces secondary bacterial infection in COPD through neutrophil elastase cleaving the anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) secretory leucocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI) and elafin to promote bacterial growth 16 . We found that sputum MUC5AC correlated positively with sputum neutrophil elastase concentrations during infection (Fig.2f) and negatively with the change from baseline in sputum SLPI and elafin concentrations during infection (Fig.2g) , consistent with greater MUC5AC levels during infection being associated with greater induction of neutrophil elastase, and consequent increased degradation of these AMPs. COPD patients with positive bacterial cultures during RV infection also had higher concentrations of sputum MUC5AC during infection and sputum MUC5AC concentrations correlated with bacterial loads determined by 16S qPCR (Fig.2h) . To confirm these latter findings observed in the rhinovirus challenge model, we performed similar analyses in the naturally occurring COPD exacerbation study author/funder. All rights reserved.

Although not induced during infection at any time point assessed, similar analyses were carried out for MUC5B. However, in contrast to MUC5AC, MUC5B did not significantly correlate with any inflammatory marker except GM-CSF (Supplementary Fig.1d) . Similarly, there were no significant correlations of MUC5B with virus load (Supplementary Fig.1e) , and changes from baseline in antimicrobial peptide concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 1f) or bacterial loads during experimental (Supplementary Fig.1g ) or naturally-occurring ( Supplementary Fig.2b ) COPD exacerbation.\n\nPro-inflammatory cytokines and cellular airway inflammation are believed to contribute to duration and severity of RV-induced asthma exacerbations 17,18 and secondary bacterial infection is also associated with greater exacerbation severity in RV-induced COPD exacerbations 16 . Having observed associations between concentrations of MUC5AC and airway inflammation, virus load and secondary bacterial infections, we next determined whether airway mucins during exacerbations were related to clinical outcomes during exacerbation. We observed that sputum MUC5AC concentrations correlated with both upper and lower respiratory tract symptom scores ( Fig.2i ) with no significant correlations observed for MUC5B (Supplementary Fig.1h ). Since chronic mucus hypersecretion is associated with long term FEV 1 decline 19 , we also hypothesized that the amplified induction of MUC5AC during RV infection would be related to acute lung function changes during COPD exacerbation. In experimental RV-induced COPD exacerbations, sputum MUC5AC concentrations correlated negatively with the maximal fall from baseline in peak expiratory flow during exacerbation ( Fig. 2j ) with no such correlation observed for MUC5B ( Supplementary Fig.1i ).\n\nTo confirm these findings, we additionally measured MUC5AC in an alternative sample type, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), as subjects in the experimental infection study also underwent bronchoscopy at baseline and day 7 after RV infection. BAL MUC5AC protein was similarly increased in COPD subjects versus healthy non-smokers with no difference observed for MUC5B (Supplementary Fig 3) .\n\nCombined, these observations confirmed that MUC5AC is the major induced mucin during human virus-induced COPD exacerbations and that concentrations of MUC5AC correlate with inflammation, virus load, secondary bacterial infections and clinical measures of exacerbation severity. author/funder.

Mice with gene-targeted deletion of Muc5ac (Muc5ac-/-) (Fig.3a) had attenuated cellular airway inflammation (BAL total cell counts and neutrophil numbers; Fig.3b ) and reduced concentrations of the neutrophil chemokines CXCL1/KC and CXCL2/MIP-2 ( Fig.   3c ) following RV infection compared to wild-type controls. BAL concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF were also reduced in RV-infected Muc5ac-/mice compared to wild-type controls (Fig. 3d) . The pro-inflammatory effects of MUC5AC\n\nwere not mediated via interference with antiviral immune responses or virus control as Muc5ac-/-mice and wild type controls had similar levels of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-l2/3 protein in BAL and no difference in lung virus loads ( Supplementary Fig 4a-d) .These data indicated that MUC5AC is functionally related to airway inflammatory responses during RV infection.\n\nTo further confirm a functional role for MUC5AC in RV-induced inflammation and exacerbation severity, we evaluated the in vivo effects of exogenous MUC5AC glycoprotein in the mouse model of RV infection (Fig.4a) . Exogenous MUC5AC administration alone had no effect on BAL inflammatory cell numbers (Fig.4b) or pro-inflammatory chemokine or cytokine concentrations ( Fig.4c&d ) but MUC5AC administration (0.5mg/mL) enhanced RVinduced airway inflammation including increased total cell and neutrophil numbers (Fig. 4b) ,\n\nand increased BAL concentrations of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL1/KC, CXCL2/MIP-2 and CCL5/RANTES and cytokines IL-1b, IL-6 and TNF (Fig.4c&d) .\n\nConversely, administration of MUC5B protein or a control polymer solution of agarose/dextran at the same concentration (0.5mg/mL) had no effect on inflammation, either alone or when administered in combination with RV infection in mice. (Supplementary Fig   5) Consistent with our hypothesis that MUC5AC drives neutrophil elastase-mediated cleavage of AMPs and subsequently increases bacterial loads, we also observed that exogenous MUC5AC increased RV-induction of neutrophil elastase (Fig.4e) , suppressed RV-induction of SLPI and augmented lung bacterial loads during virus infection (Fig.4f) .

A previous study demonstrated that supernatants of mucopurulent material from subjects with cystic fibrosis can induce epithelial release of extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) 20 , a well-recognised promoter of inflammation 21 that is also virus-inducible 22 . We therefore hypothesised that MUC5AC exerts its pro-inflammatory effects during RV infection via induction of extracellular ATP and examined the effect of ATP neutralisation using the ATP-hydrolysing enzyme apyrase in exogenous MUC5AC-treated RV-infected mice (Fig 5a) . Exogenous MUC5AC protein administration augmented BAL concentrations of ATP in RV-infected mice, an effect that was abrogated by instillation of apyrase (Fig 5b) . Apyrase administration also suppressed exogenous MUC5AC-mediated increases in airway inflammation during RV infection including BAL total cells and neutrophils (Fig. 5c) , inflammatory chemokines CXCL1/KC, CXCL2/MIP-2 and CCL5/RANTES (Fig. 5d) and pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1b (Fig. 5e) . Apyrase also prevented the exogenous MUC5AC-mediated increase in neutrophil elastase, reversed the MUC5AC-mediated suppression of SLPI and suppressed MUC5ACmediated increased bacterial loads in RV-infected mice (Fig 5f-g) . Apyrase-mediated reversal of pro-inflammatory effects of MUC5AC did not occur via interference with antiviral immune responses or virus control, as we also observed no effect of apyrase on RVinduction of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-l2/3 (Supplementary Fig.6a -c) or lung virus loads ( Supplementary   Fig.6d) .\n\nThese data confirmed that MUC5AC exerts its pro-inflammatory effects during RV infection through MUC5AC-mediated induction of release of extracellular ATP.\n\nHaving confirmed the functional importance of MUC5AC in RV-induced airway inflammation, we next hypothesised that inhibiting RV-induction of this glycoprotein would have beneficial author/funder.

Rhinoviruses induce MUC5AC expression through EGFR signalling 23 . We therefore assessed the effect of EGFR inhibition in a mouse model of elastase-induced emphysema combined with RV-infection in which many features of human COPD exacerbation including mucus hypersecretion are recapitulated 24 .\n\nAdministration of the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 prior to RV infection in elastase treated mice ( Fig.6a) suppressed RV-induction of lung Muc5ac mRNA, BAL MUC5AC protein (Fig.6b) and suppressed airway epithelial cell mucus staining in lung sections (Fig. 6c , control groups are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7) . AG1478 had no effect on BAL MUC5B protein concentrations (Supplementary Fig.8a&b ). AG1478 administration in elastase-treated mice also suppressed RV-induction of BAL cellular airway inflammation (Fig.6d) , as well as chemokines CXCL1/KC, CXCL2/MIP-2 and CCL5/RANTES (Fig.6e) , pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1b, IL-6, TNF and GM-CSF ( Fig.6f ) and neutrophil elastase (Fig.6g ). AG1478 treatment in elastase-treated RV-infected mice also enhanced BAL SLPI levels and reduced pulmonary bacterial loads (Fig.6h ). Finally, elastase and AG1478-treated RV-infected mice had reduced AHR to methacholine challenge compared to elastase and vehicle treated, RV infected controls (Fig.6i) These anti-inflammatory effects of AG1478 were not mediated via interference with antiviral immune responses or virus control, as we also observed no effect of AG1478 on RVinduction of IFN-\u03b1, IFN-l2/3 (Supplementary Fig.8c&d ) or lung virus loads.\n\n( Supplementary Fig.8e ).\n\nauthor/funder.

Here, we provide insight into the role that the major airway mucin glycoprotein MUC5AC plays in the biology of these episodes. Using a combination of human and mouse models of rhinovirus infection in COPD, we demonstrate a novel central role of virus-induced MUC5AC in driving COPD exacerbation severity through amplification of airway inflammation, findings that open up new opportunities for targeting MUC5AC therapeutically. We indicate a mechanism for MUC5AC augmentation of RV-induced inflammation via release of extracellular ATP.\n\nWe show here, that MUC5AC is selectively induced during virus-induced COPD exacerbations and increased compared to virus-infected healthy subjects. By contrast, MUC5B was not induced above baseline and did not differ between COPD and control subjects at any timepoint, indicating that MUC5AC is the major induced mucin during exacerbations. We also found positive correlations between MUC5AC and a range of inflammatory markers. Since airway inflammation is enhanced in COPD exacerbations and believed to contribute to duration and severity of RV induced illnesses 17, 18 we also determined the relationship between MUC5AC and exacerbation severity, finding positive correlations with virus loads, symptom scores and acute lung function decline. MUC5AC is one of the major glycoprotein components of airway mucus and it is therefore unsurprising that its expression during virus infection correlates with lower respiratory symptom scores which comprise an assessment of sputum production. The correlation of MUC5AC with PEF decline can be explained by the fact that greater mucus production is likely to contribute directly to airway obstruction during exacerbation. Our findings in this acute human infection model are in keeping with clinical studies that have reported the association of symptomdefined chronic mucus hypersecretion phenotype with airflow limitation and FEV 1 decline 19, 25 and an animal study showing that genetic deletion of Muc5ac reduces mucus occlusion and improves lung function in models of allergic airway inflammation 11 .\n\nWe have previously reported that experimental RV infection in patients with COPD is associated with increased frequency of secondary bacterial infection compared to healthy subjects 16,26 via a mechanism of virus-induced neutrophil elastase-mediated cleavage of the anti-microbial peptides SLPI and elafin. The positive correlation of sputum MUC5AC with neutrophil numbers, neutrophil elastase concentrations and secondary bacterial infection and negative correlation with SLPI and elafin levels observed in the current study suggests that increased MUC5AC could be one mechanism contributing to enhanced neutrophilic author/funder.

This contrasts our findings using exogenous MUC5AC administration where there was no effect on virus loads and MUC5AC enhanced virus-induced inflammation. The transgenic strain employed by Ehre et al was associated with ~18-fold increase in airway MUC5AC levels 9 . This level of augmentation greatly exceeds the increases observed in our human analyses where a ~2-fold increase was observed in stable state levels of MUC5AC in COPD versus healthy subjects and ~2-to 3-fold increase was observed from baseline to exacerbation. The concentrations of exogenous MUC5AC protein administered in our animal experiments (0.25-0.5mg/mL) were ~ 1.5-3.5 fold higher than the baseline MUC5AC protein concentrations we measured in the mouse airway (~150\u00b5g/mL) and are therefore more likely to be physiologically relevant to human exacerbation. Further, the effect of MUC5AC in reducing virus loads at the much higher MUC5AC levels generated in the MUC5AC transgenic strain reported by Ehre et al may be virus-specific 9 . The authors reported that MUC5AC binds to the influenza virus receptor, \u03b12,3-linked sialic acids in transgenic animals, consistent with a mechanism of influenza protection in vivo through impairment of efficient binding of virus to receptors on the bronchial epithelium leading to reduction in virus loads and consequently lesser inflammation. It is important to note that we used a non-human purified mucin protein in solution for our experiments which does not fully recapitulate the complex biophysical properties of mucin glycoprotein contained within endogenous airway mucus. We confirmed that the mucin preparation used was free of endotoxin and DNA but we cannot exclude that other mucin-bound proteins are present in the solution that may be contributing to the observed effects. Future validation of our findings using administration of human or mouse MUC5AC in similar mouse models is warranted, although extraction and purification of mucins from these sources is technically challenging and was not feasible for the current studies.\n\nWe identified a mechanism for amplification of rhinovirus-induced airway inflammation by MUC5AC through release of ATP, a danger signal that is released during infection and contributes to nucleotide receptor-dependent inflammatory responses 32 . This mechanism was suggested in a previous study that indicated that administration of sterile supernatants of mucopurulent material from subjects with cystic fibrosis can induce ATP release by human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro 20 . The role of ATP as a potential driver of airway inflammation in stable asthma and COPD is well recognised 33,34 .

We therefore speculate that mucin-induced airway inflammation might trigger further production of MUC5AC leading to a vicious cycle which contributes to enhanced airway inflammation and mucus hypersecretion to drive exacerbation severity in COPD. We thus hypothesised that early targeting of MUC5AC during rhinovirus infection might beneficially interrupt this cycle and evaluated the effect of upstream inhibition of rhinovirus-induction of MUC5AC using the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 in a COPD exacerbation mouse model. AG1478 suppressed rhinovirus-induced MUC5AC levels, accompanied by reduced airway inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, neutrophil elastase and AHR, as well as enhanced SLPI production and reduced bacterial loads in rhinovirus-infected elastase-treated mice. Importantly, AG1478 had no impact on anti-viral responses, or virus control, reassuringly indicating that therapies aimed at inhibiting MUC5AC production would not be expected to adversely affect anti-viral host-defence. Jing et al recently reported in COPD airway epithelial cell cultures that administration of an EGFR inhibitor had no effect on RV-induction of MUC5AC and concluded that EGFR does not play a role in promoting virus-induced mucin expression in COPD 36 . However, in this study, the authors examined mucin expression solely at a late timepoint (15 days) post RV infection and did not evaluate effects of the treatment on mucin expression at earlier timepoints nor subsequent effects on production of inflammatory mediators. The data from our human challenge model indicates that peak RV induction of MUC5AC occurs at a much earlier timepoint (3 days) and previous studies have shown that EGFR inhibition can attenuate the early induction of MUC5AC in RV-stimulated airway epithelial cell cultures 23, 37 Our data in a mouse model of COPD-like disease supports the assertion that the early production of MUC5AC in response to RV infection occurs through EGFR and is thus amenable to therapeutic inhibition. A previous study using an inhaled EGFR inhibitor in stable COPD reported more effective EGFR inhibition was related to greater decreases in epithelial mucin stores at higher doses, but this drug was poorly tolerated 38 . Systemic EGFR antagonists are now commonly used in lung adenocarcinoma therapy 39 . Our data in mice now provides justification for human studies to evaluate the role of repurposing these agents for use in COPD exacerbations to inhibit MUC5AC production which could theoretically suppress airway inflammation, reduce secondary bacterial infection and diminish exacerbation severity.\n\nauthor/funder.

Sputum plugs from severe asthmatics have previously been shown to contain more MUC5AC than MUC5B 40 and this constituent likely contains more surface goblet cell derived mucin which may contribute to the differences observed between induction of these two mucins in our studies. However, we also observed increased RVinduced MUC5AC but not MUC5B in an alternative sample type (BAL) from COPD subjects versus healthy subjects, supporting our findings in sputum. There is also evidence to suggest that proteases within sputum samples can interfere with immunodetection of mucins 14 . Some studies have attempted to address this by using treatment with protease inhibitors shortly after sputum collection 6, 41 . We have previously reported, using samples from the same study, that neutrophil elastase is increased in COPD subjects compared to healthy subjects following virus challenge 16 . Given that we observed greater induction of MUC5AC protein in COPD subjects compared to healthy subjects, despite increased levels of proteases, this suggests that the actual difference between these two groups could be even more substantial than observed in our study. Additionally, our finding that sputum MUC5AC but not MUC5B mRNA expression was increased during naturally-occurring exacerbation (mirroring what was observed at the protein level) provides an additional confirmatory approach that would not be subject to these potential confounders. Other studies have used alternative semi-quantitative antibody-independent techniques 7,14,42 but it is unclear whether these approaches would have sufficient sensitivity to detect subtle changes in mucin expression during infection. The primary aim of the human component of our study was to study how mucin levels change during virus-induced exacerbations and our study was unique in that we had sequential sampling from individual patients during exacerbation with consistent methods used to measure mucins in all subjects.\n\nIn conclusion, we show that MUC5AC is the major induced mucin during virus infection in COPD and that virus-induced MUC5AC plays a central role in driving airway inflammation and exacerbation severity in COPD. Future development or repurposing of therapies that specifically target this component of mucus could lead to improved clinical outcomes. author/funder. All rights reserved.

Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out using previously described specific primers and probes for human and mouse MUC5AC and MUC5B and rhinovirus RNA copy numbers 23, 47, 49 , and normalized to 18S rRNA.\n\nDNA extraction from human sputum and mouse lung was performed using the FastDNA Spin Kit for Soil (MP Biomedicals, USA), following manufacturer instructions. Bead-beating was performed for two cycles of 30 seconds at 6800 rpm (Precellys, Bertin Technologies, France). 16S bacterial loads were measured using qPCR, as previously described 50 .\n\nData from human COPD studies were analysed using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test or Mann-Witney U test. Correlations between datasets were examined using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. For mouse experiments, animals were studied in group sizes of 5 mice with data shown representative of at least 2 independent experiments.\n\nData were analysed using one or two-way ANOVA with significant differences between groups assessed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. All statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 software. Differences were considered significant when P<0.05. author/funder. All rights reserved.

These differences are attributed to the harsh conditions during the commercial purification process 5 . As a consequence, here, the purification of porcine gastric MUC5AC is performed manually from fresh pig stomachs. An optimization of the original purification protocol from Celli et.al 6 was described in detail previously 3 . In brief, crude mucus was obtained by gently scraping pig stomachs after rinsing them with tap water. The mucus was diluted 5-fold in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, supplemented with 170 mM NaCl) and homogenized by stirring at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Cellular debris was removed via several centrifugation steps (8.300 x g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C and 15.000 x g for 45 min at 4 \u00b0C) and a final ultracentrifugation step (150.000 x g for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C). Afterwards, the supernatant was separated chromatographically by size-exclusion chromatography (\u00c4KTA purifier system, GE Healthcare, equipped with a XK50/100 column packed with Sepharose 6FF), and the fractions containing the mucin glycoproteins were identified via PAS (periodic acid/Schiff's base) staining and pooled. After a subsequent dialysis step against ultra-pure water via cross-flow filtration, the mucin-solution was concentrated, lyophilized and stored at -80 \u00b0C.\n\nLyophilized bovine salivary mucin MUC5B powder was purchased from Merck (499643, Darmstadt, Germany) and dissolved in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, supplemented with 1 M NaCl) at a concentration of 1 mg mL -1 and the solution was rotated on a rotating incubator for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. Further purification of salivary mucin MUC5B was conducted according to the protocol used for purifying gastric mucin MUC5AC as described above.\n\nSince the gastric mucosa also contains DNA 7 , enzymatic removal of potential mucinassociated DNA was performed to prevent any DNA-related inflammation reactions. All following steps were carried out under a sterile hood. Lyophilized mucin purified from porcine gastric mucosa was treated with UV-light on ice for 1 hour. Subsequently, it was dissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (sterile filtered, pH 7.5, supplemented with 10 mM MgCl 2 ) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL and kept on ice. DNAse I from bovine pancreas (D5025, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was dissolved in the same buffer at a concentration of 1 mg/mL. 50 \u00b5L of the DNAse solution were added per milligram of dissolved mucin. Afterwards, the mucin/DNAse solution was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 18 hours in a tube shaker at 200 rpm. The treated mucin was then chromatographically separated from the enzyme and residual DNA fragments via size exclusion chromatography, subsequently desalted by means of cross-flow filtration and lyophilized (see Purification of porcine gastric mucin section above). The DNAse treated mucin was stored in lyophilized form at -80 \u00b0C. author/funder. All rights reserved.

Therefore, 40 \u00b5g of the mucin samples were mixed with Laemmli buffer, loaded on a polyacrylamide gel (Mini-Protean TGX Gels 4-20%, #45-1093, BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) and separated (60 V for 10 min and 120 V until the dye front reached the end of the gel). The gel was stained using SYBR Green I afterwards (diluted 1:10.000 in TBE buffer) at room temperature under gentle shaking for 30 min. The DNA stain was visualized with a Gel Doc EZ Gel Documentation System (Biorad) with epi-illumination at a wavelength of 254 nm (Fig. 1) . We additionally confirmed that DNA was undetectable in samples of MUC5AC protein using Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol, as previously described 8 .
