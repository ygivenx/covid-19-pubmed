It firstly emerged in Anhui Province and Shanghai City, P.R. China in February, 2013 [1] , and more cases were then reported in the Eastern China [2] . The disease is characterized by acute onset and high mortality, which poses a great threat to human health. In this paper, we retrospectively reviewed chest radiographs and Computed Tomography (CT) findings in 11 patients that had confirmatively been diagnosed with H7N9 subtype of human avian influenza.\n\nThis study retrospectively reviewed the clinical and imaging data of 11 patients with H7N9 subtype of human avian influenza (Table 1) The study subjects included 7 males and 4 females with their ages ranging from 20 to 84 years and a mean of 55.6 years. All 11 patients had initially presented with influenzalike sympotoms, including fever (100%, 11/11), cough (72.7%, 8/11), expectoration (45.5%, 5/11), chest tightness (18.2%, 2/11), muscular pain (18.2%, 2/11), shortness of breath (9.1%, 1/11), fatigue (9.1%, 1/11), sore throat (9.1%, 1/ 11) and vomiting (9.1%, 1/11). Seven of the 11 subjects had the following medical histories: thoracic surgery with excision of thymoma(n \u00bc 1), pregnancy(n \u00bc 1), hypertension(n \u00bc 3) and chronic bronchitis(n \u00bc 2). The other 4 patients had no significant medical history. The initial WBC count was normal in 7 patients, low in 3 patients and high in 1 patient.\n\nAfter onset of the illness, all 11 patients were hospitalized for 1e10 days and received antiviral and respiratory support therapies.\n\nPosteroanterior radiographs were obtained using Axiom Aristos (Siemens Healthcare) with a constant technique of 125Kv and automatic mA adjustment. MDCT was performed on 64-MDCT scanner (Somatom Sensation, Siemens healthcare), 128-MDCT scanner (Somatom Definition, Siemens healthcare) and 4-MDCT scanner (Brightspeed excel, GE healthcare). The scan protocol was as the following: 120 kV, automatic mA adjustment (about 115mAs), pitch of 0.9, matrix of 512 \u00c2 512, thickness of 5.0e6.0 mm, interval of 1.4 mm, and 0.75 mm reformation.\n\nAll 11 patients had serial bedside anteroposteriorprojection follow-up radiographs at an interval of 2 or 3 days, while only 7 patients required follow-up CT scans. Bedside anteroposterior-projection radiographs were obtained with a mobile unit (Philips Healthcare), using a standard exposure factor of 80 kV and 5 mAs.\n\nThe chest radiographs and MDCT images were independently reviewed by two experienced radiologists and final interpretations were achieved by consensus. The anatomic distribution was characterized as either unilateral or bilateral. The extent of abnormality was graded as focal, multifocal and diffuse. The abnormalities were characterized as consolidation (opacification with obscuration of the underlying vessels), ground-glass opacity (GGO) which increased attenuation without obscuration of the underlying vessels, nodules opacities and reticulation. The presence of enlarged lymph nodes and pleural effusions were also recorded.\n\nThe initial chest radiographs were abnormal in all 11 patients ( Table 2) (Fig. 1A) . The lung abnormalities were unilateral in 45.5% or 5/11 patients (4/5 in left lung and 1/5 in right lung) and bilateral in the rest of 6 patients. The abnormalities were found in one lobe in 4 patients, two lobes in 2 patients, three lobes in 2 patients and four lobes in 3 patients, respectively. The predominant chest imaging finding was segmental or lobar consolidation (72.7% or 8/11), among which three (3/8) showed multi-nodular opacities ( Fig. 2A) , and two (2/8) presented with combined segmental ground-glass opacity. Segmental ground-glass opacity was demonstrated in 2 patients (18.2% or 2/11). Multi-patchy shadows presented in 1 patient (9.1% or 1/11).\n\nAir bronchogram was a commonly seen lung abnormality (63.6% or 7/11). A sharp boundary due to the interlobar fissure was also manifested (36.4% or 4/11).\n\nThickened adjacent pleura could be seen in four patients and pleural effusions were found in two patients. Lymph node enlargement was not significant in any of the eleven cases.\n\nDuring 3e15 days after onset, eight patients showed obvious progress of the conditions compared to initial abnormalities (Fig. 1B) . Firstly, lesions increased in size, progress from unilateral to bilateral lungs or diffuse distribution (Fig. 2B) . Secondly, density of abnormalities developed from GGO to consolidation. The patients at this stage were characterized as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with occurrence of death in 2 cases and no obvious change in other 3 cases.\n\nAfter 15 days, three of the rest 9 patients (3/9) were improved compared with the former lesions (Fig. 2Ce2D) . The abnormalities demonstrated as reticulation with a decreased extent. One of these three patients had segmental consolidation in the left upper lobe and segmental consolidation in bilateral lower lobes at the initial scanning, but was improved afterwards. One patient (1/9) who had previously undergone thoracic surgery for excision of thymoma showed segmental consolidation in the left upper lobe by the initial radiograph and CT scan seven days after onset (Fig. 3A) , and diffuse GGO and consolidation at both lungs by the bedside radiograph ten days after onset (Fig. 3B) . The extent and density of the abnormalities remained unchanged during the following twenty days (Fig. 3Ce3D) . The extent of abnormalities of the other five patients also remained unchanged but with invariable or slightly deteriorated clinical conditions. Death occurred in another 4 cases at this stage.\n\nOn March 2013, a subtype of avian influenza virus causing human infections, H7N9, was identified in Eastern China. H7 subtypes (H7N2, H7N3 and H7N7) of avian influenza viruses are commonly found and are often limited to mild illness, among which only one case of death was reported in Table 2 Summary of the initial radiograph and CT scan in 11 patients with H7N9 subtype of human avian influenza.\n\nX-ray CT 1 Unilateral patchy GGO Unilateral segmental GGO 2 Unilateral patchy GGO Unilateral segmental GGO 3 Bilateral patchy GGO Bilateral lobar consolidation and nodular consolidation 4\n\nBilateral lobar consolidation Bilateral lobar consolidation 5\n\nUnilateral patchy consolidation Unilateral segmental consolidation 6\n\nUnilateral patchy consolidation Unilateral segmental consolidation 7\n\nUnilateral patchy consolidation Unilateral segmental consolidation 8\n\nUnilateral lobar consolidation Bilateral lobar consolidation or GGO and nodular consolidation 9\n\nBilateral patchy consolidation and GGO Bilateral segmental GGO and consolidation 10\n\nUnilateral lobar consolidation Bilateral lobar or segmental consolidation and nodular consolidation 11\n\nUnilateral lobar consolidation Bilateral patchy consolidation Netherlands [3, 4] . To our knowledge, this is the first time that H7N9 subtype has infected human and caused death. Preliminary studies have shown that the H7N9 subtype of avian influenza virus is novel reassortants and more virulent in humans than other H7 viruses [4, 5] . Infection of H7N9 subtype of avian influenza virus typically manifests itself as flulike symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, headache and body aches [1, 6] . The clinical findings of the 11 patients from our group that had been confirmatively diagnosed as infection of H7N9 subtype of avian influenza virus reveal that rapid progress is characteristic of this disease. A high incidence of severe pneumonia is a common abnormality, with all eleven patients suffering from persistent fever (body temperature of 39 C or above), and accompanying dyspnea or ARDS. WBC count may be normal or slightly decrease [2] .\n\nIn our study, the pulmonary lesions of H7N9 infection of human avian influenza were radiologically demonstrated to be segmental or lobar GGO or consolidation combined with air bronchogram at the initial stage without a predominant distribution, which are inconsistent with findings from previous studies [7] . We believe that the pathological mechanism of infection of H7N9 subtype of avian influenza virus may resemble to other viral pneumonia and is based on alveolar exudation. The lesions can develop into either multiple or diffuse at both lungs with rapid progress at the progressive stage, or reticulation when the abnormalities improve later into the later stage (after 20 days) [5, 6] . According to the evolution process by radiology, infection of H7N9 subtype of avian influenza virus can be divided into three stages. The initial stage is the first 3 days after onset. The progressive stage is the period of d 3-15 after onset. Period since d 15 after onset is defined as the stable stage. The stable stage is protracted for some cases due to the remaining viral infection in addition with bacterial infections. Pleural effusions are rarely seen and lymph node enlargement is not significant.\n\nThe imaging demonstrations of H7N9 subtype infection of avian influenza virus may resemble to other pneumonia including novel swine influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) infection, severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS), bacterial pneumonia and highly pathogenic H5N1 subtype human avian influenza virus infection. The main imaging findings of S-OIV infection and SARS are unilateral or bilateral GGO or focal areas of consolidations with a predominant peribronchovascular and subpleural distribution [8e10], while H7N9 subtype avian influenza infection presents pulmonary segment or lobar exudative lesions without obvious distinctive distribution. Bacterial pneumonia usually shows lobar consolidation and increased WBC clinically, which can recover quickly by antibiotic therapy. The imaging findings of H7N9 subtype infection of avian influenza virus resemble to those of H5N1 subtype infection of avian influenza virus, both of which have pulmonary segment or lobar exudative lesions as the predominant imaging findings except that multifocal consolidations have a predilection at lower lobes in cases of H5N1 subtype infection of avian influenza virus [11] . However, differential diagnosis relies on virus isolation and detection [6] .\n\nThis study has several limitations. Firstly, it is a retrospective study based on a series of 11 cases. Secondly, none of the patients underwent lung biopsy or autospy that allowed radiographicsehistopathologic correlation.\n\nIn summary, the imaging findings of H7N9 subtype infection of avian influenza virus in this series of patients tends to be pulmonary segment or lobar consolidation and mostly progress rapidly into diffuse exudation.\n\nThe authors have no financial interests related to the present manuscript.
