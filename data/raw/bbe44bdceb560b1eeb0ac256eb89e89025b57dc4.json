The treatment also prevented RVA diarrhea and virus shedding 2 after a second virus challenge (seven days after the end of the passive Ab treatment). 3 We observed that egg yolk treatment promoted a modulatory effect on ASC responses 4 in the gut, inducing high numbers of bovine RVA-specific IgA ASCs (Vega et al., 2011) .\n\nThis 14-day-long prophylactic treatment could be advantageous in dairy herds where 6 bovine RVA is a major epidemiological concern. Still, other oral IgY-based treatments 7 can be useful in dairy farms where RVA-associated diarrhea is a concern but less 8 severe, decreasing the therapy\u00b4s costs. Little is known about the usefulness of IgY Ab 9 as a treatment to bovine RVA once virus infection has already induced diarrhea under 10 controlled environmental conditions. The aim of the present study was to determine the 11 potential application of spray dried egg yolk powder enriched in bovine RVA-specific IgY\n\nAb as a passive therapeutic treatment to be applied for 7 days after the appearance of 13 diarrhea in neonatal calves experimentally challenged with virulent bovine RVA (G6P[5] 14 strain). The potential of the powder as a commercial product was further evaluated. randomly assigned to one of the following feeding groups (G): G1= colostrum (C) + milk 6 supplemented with bovine RVA-specific egg yolk powder with a final ELISA IgY Ab titer 7 to Indiana RVA strain of 4096 (n=4); G2= C + RVA Ab free milk (n=5) and G3= 8 colostrum deprived (CD) + RVA Ab free milk (n=6). These last two groups of calves 9 were considered controls. Colostrum deprived calves are often found in herds where 10 animals are not artificially assisted and many of the newborns fail to fed before the first 11 hours of life. Calves in G1 and G2 received 1 L of colostrum pool from RVA non- tests. The presence of coproantibodies (coproAb) was also assessed by ELISA.\n\nPeripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were sampled at PID 0 and then weekly, to assess 1 ASC responses by ELISPOT assay. At PID 21, the animals were euthanized and the Collected eggs from immunized hens were grouped weekly and their yolks were diluted 20 in distilled water at a ratio of 1:3 and stored at -20\u00b0C. immediately. At the same time points, egg yolk powder was sent to a private laboratory 10 to determine the physicochemical composition and microbiological status of the product. We studied the local Ab responses to bovine RVA in feces by isotype-specific ELISA. 7 Results obtained are also depicted in Figure 1 together with virus shedding and diarrhea Ab to Indiana RVA strain in feces. Although no other significant differences were 18 observed between coproAb titers to bovine RVA, calves in G1 showed a trend toward 19 lower RVA Ab titers than animals in G2 and G3 (Figure 1 ). 20 At PID 21, animals were euthanized and contents from large (LIC) and small (SIC) 21 intestinal sections were collected. Bovine Abs to Indiana RVA strain were also detected 22 by the same ELISA assay as before (see Figure 1 ). The IgA and IgG1 Abs were The physicochemical composition and microbiological status of egg yolk powder were determined at the packaging stage (0 days from powder production, Table 2 ) and at the 19 20 In the present study we evaluated the use of IgY Abs to bovine RVA as a passive oral 21 therapeutic treatment to control RVA-associated diarrhea in newborn calves. Animals systemic Ab responses to bovine RVA seem to be higher in colostrum deprived calves, 19 while G2 calves showed intermediate responses. 20 It has been reported that IgY Abs against bovine RVA can be used to prevent virus-21 associated diarrhea in newborn calves (Vega et al., 2011) . In this work we focus on the Egg yolk powder samples were specially taken at the packaging stage and sent to a 12 private laboratory to determine its physicochemical composition and microbiological 13 status. CFU/g: colony-forming units per gram. -Neonatal calf diarrhea is a critical problem and passive therapy with IgY Abs is a way to control it. 4 -There are no solid studies using Rotavirus specific IgY Abs once calves suffer diarrhea. 5\n\n-We provide here scientific information regarding the effects of IgY-based products. 6 -This information is critical considering that IgY Abs are being sold in several countries. 7\n\n-We prove the therapeutic value of IgY -based treatment and the industrialization of this product. 8 9 Formatted: Space After: 10 pt, Line spacing: Multiple 1.15 li, Bulleted + Level: 1 + Aligned at: 0.25\" + Indent at: 0.5\""}
