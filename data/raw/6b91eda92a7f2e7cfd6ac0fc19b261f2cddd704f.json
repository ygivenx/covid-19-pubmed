{"title": "Approach to a Child with Sore Throat", "body": "Upper Respiratory tract infections are seen with great frequency in both children and adults and have remarkable economic impact, related to the frequent prescription by physicians of antibiotics, even when the causative agents of infection are not bacteria. About one-fourth of children with sore throat have bacterial pharyngitis and about half of the families with index case have a secondary case [1] .\n\nIdentification and adequate antibiotic treatment of group A streptococcal sore throat is important for primary prevention of acute rheumatic fever, as it carries approximately 3% risk of development of acute rheumatic fever.\n\nSoreness is generally described by the patient as pain in the throat without the effort of swallowing and also a painful swallow [2] . Sore throat is primary symptom of pharyngitis. The terms \"sore throat\" and \"pharyngitis or pharyngotonsillitis\" are often used interchangeably. Pharyngitis refers to objective evidence of inflammation of the pharynx, such as exudates, ulceration, or definite erythema. Redness of the throat may occur as part of the general redness of all mucous membranes in a patient with fever. A diagnosis of pharyngitis is justified only when the pharynx is redder than the rest of the oral mucosa.\n\nMost sore throats are caused by viruses. Less often, sore throats are due to bacterial infections. Several scoring systems have been developed to predict which patients will have GABHS. Use of these does improve quality of care but none of these systems, however, is totally reliable in identifying children who need treatment [4] . A clinical scoring system has been designed in India but it has to be validated for local use. This scoring system uses variables such as age, season, fever, erythema of pharynx, size of tonsil, pharyngeal exudates; lymphadenopathy and pain in throat, and scores are assigned according to throat culture positivity in association with the same. Cut off value of 15 predicts GAS infection with 91% sensitivity and 98% specificity [3] .\n\nThe evaluation of patient should include the following: Poor quality of the heart sounds raises the possibility of diphtheritic myocarditis. Absence of a heart murmur or dependent edema should be noted for their relevance to rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis.\n\nCommon signs and symptoms of streptococcal pharyngitis include sore throat, temperature \u226538.3\u00b0C, tonsillar or pharyngeal exudates and cervical lymphadenopathy. Cough, coryza and diarrhea are more common with viral pharyngitis. Differentiating features between streptococcal pharyngitis and viral pharyngitis are given in Table 2 .\n\nA major concern in emergency room for a child with sore throat is not to miss diagnosis of diphtheria and GABHS pharyngitis.\n\n& Obtain throat swab for bacterial smear and culture including Albert stains for diphtheria. A provisional diagnosis of diphtheria is suggested if typical drum stick organisms are seen in the smear. However, a definitive diagnosis requires growth of C. diphtherium in culture as diphtheroids are commensals in throat. & Rapid Antigen Diagnostic Tests (RADTs) for GABHS [5, 6] : It is based on nitrous acid extraction of group A carbohydrate antigen from organisms obtained by throat a High sensitivity for GABHS [1] b High specificity for GABHS [1] swab. It is highly specific (>95%), and provides immediate results, but has variable sensitivity. Throat culture confirmation of a negative RADT is recommended to increase sensitivity. Confirmation of positive test is not recommended because of very high specificity. & Other investigations to be done according to clinical possibility.\n\n\u25cb Complete blood count \u25cb Peripheral blood smears-for atypical lymphocytes. \u25cb EB virus serology (IgM antibody against VCA(viral capsular antigen)) \u25cb Streptococcal antibody titre is not useful for diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis and is not routinely recommended.\n\nNote: antibiotics are indicated in any child who is looking sick and/or suspected to have complications. Throat Swab Sampling Technique Samples should be obtained by vigorous swabbing of both tonsillar surfaces or fossae and the posterior pharynx [6, 7] . Correctly sampled and plated, throat swab culture has 90-95% sensitivity. Swabbing the soft palate and uvula should be avoided, because it dilutes the inoculums.\n\nGABHS pharyngitis is self-limiting illness. Antibiotic treatment provides acute symptom relief, prevent suppurative (otitis media, sinusitis, quinsy) and non suppurative complications, and reduce communicability. Antibiotics reduce incidence of rheumatic fever by more than two third [8] . Clinical decision guideline for sore throat is given in Fig. 1 .\n\nClinical features, epidemiological criteria and expert clinician judgment with or without supportive investigation usually indicate need for antibiotics. Currently used score for decision making in pharyngitis has been adapted by adding age to four components of original Centor score (absence of cough, swollen and tender anterior cervical nodes, temperature >38\u00b0C and tonsillar exudates or swelling) [9] . Each component is given 1 point; age of 3-14 years carries 1 point while that of 14-44 years, zero. Patients with a score of zero or 1 do not require testing or antibiotic therapy. Patients with score of 2 or 3 should be tested and prescribed antibiotics if found positive while patients with score of 4 or higher, are at high risk of streptococcal pharyngitis and should be given empiric treatment [10] .\n\nBased on cost, narrow spectrum of activity, safety, and effectiveness, penicillin is the drug of choice [10, 11] . Shorter duration of treatment increases risk of bacteriological recurrence [12] Inappropriate use of macrolides for treatment of GABHS pharyngitis has been the main cause of resistant strains in western countries [13] . The various alternatives to penicillin and the dosage of antibiotics are given in Table 3 .\n\n& Stabilize child (ABC\u2026) (For details refer to section on upper airway obstruction). & Diphtheria antitoxin: 50,000-120,000 U IV depending on extent of involvement.\n\n& Antibiotics: Aqueous crystalline penicillin G 40,000 U/ kg/dose 6 hourly IV or erythromycin 15 mg/kg 8 hourly (not to exceed 2 g/day) oral/IV for 14 days.\n\nFor prophylaxis to contacts same dose of erythromycin for 7 days or a single injection of benzathine penicillin G (600,000 U IM for <30 kg, 1,200,000 U IM for \u226530 kg.) is recommended.\n\n& Toxic looking child & Not accepting orally well & Suspected to having associated complications or diphtheria."}
