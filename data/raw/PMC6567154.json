{"title": "Health and zoonotic Infections of snow leopards Panthera unica in the South Gobi desert of Mongolia", "body": "While the overall decrease in biodiversity is often attributed to environmental changes such as land clearing, habitat d estruction, feral pests and climate change, emerging infectious disease can also act as a primary or contributory cause [1\u20133]. Pathogens can particularly impact endangered and threatened species where populations are already depleted and genetic diversity may be low [4]. The rarity of endangered species makes them challenging to sample systematically, but constant surveillance and collection of baseline health data with ongoing monitoring will aid in determining the impacts of disease in threatened species.\n\nSnow leopards (Panthera uncia) are a rare and threatened species, occurring in the high mountains of South and Central Asia including the Himalayas in the south, through the Pamirs, Tien Shan and Altay in the north. The population of reproductive snow leopards is believed to be fewer than 4500 and is continuing to decline [5,6]. In 2008, the Snow Leopard Trust and Snow Leopard Conservation Fund initiated an ongoing, long-term ecological study of snow leopards in the South Gobi Province of Mongolia. During 2011 the field team recorded four snow leopard carcasses on separate locations, three within the study area in the Tost Mountains and one in the Gurvan Saikhan Mountain range, an adjacent range to the northeast. The causes of mortality were not established. There were no signs of trauma or starvation therefore other potential causes of death included infectious diseases. Two of the dead snow leopards were radio-collared territorial males with no overlap in their home ranges, suggesting independent causes of death. The finding of these dead snow leopards prompted the initiation of this disease study.\n\nDespite the range of investigations into threats to snow leopards, none have addressed the prevalence or impacts of disease in the wild. All prior reports on diseases in snow leopards are restricted to zoo animals and include common feline viruses such as feline parvovirus, calicivirus, feline infectious peritonitis (a viral disease caused by a strain of feline coronavirus), feline immune deficiency virus and canine distemper virus, and a papillomavirus specific to snow leopards [7,8]. Non-viral diseases have included veno-occlusive disease, ocular colobomas, tumours and Tyzzer\u2019s disease [9\u201312]. Several zoonotic diseases such as, leptospirosis, tuberculosis and Toxascaris infection have also been recorded [13,14].\n\nThreatened species are not likely to support the circulation of species- specific infectious agents because densities of threatened species are generally low and intra-species interactions are in many cases infrequent [15]. As snow leopard numbers are low, detecting pathogens specific to felids and determining their effects would be challenging and limited. However, pathogens with several species of reservoir hosts, as in the case of zoonotic pathogens, may be readily detected and can impact species at low abundance through disease spill-over [16].\n\nThe most prevalent zoonotic infections reported in Central Asian Mountain livestock are rabies, anthrax, plague, leptospirosis, Q fever, brucellosis, toxoplasmosis and echinococcosis [17\u201319]. Endemic zoonoses are often under-reported due to a lack of public awareness and public health services and so the disease threat may be greater than what is reflected in the literature [20]. Snow leopards live alongside nomadic herders and their livestock throughout their range [21], which may be sources of infection to snow leopards and vice versa.\n\nThis study aimed to investigate important zoonotic pathogens that may impact the conservation of snow leopards in Mongolia. Due to the low numbers of snow leopards available for sampling, combined with the possibility of other species endemic to the area that could act as reservoir hosts for pathogens combined with the closeness of the nomadic herders to all components of their environment, we decided to target zoonotic pathogens that can circulate between different host species and hence also impact the health of snow leopards. The zoonotic pathogens selected to sample for were based on prior occurrence in Mongolia, pathogenicity, the potential to infect snow leopards and potential economic losses for the herders. These pathogens included Coxiella burnetii, Toxoplasma gondii and Leptospira spp. Two of the most severe zoonoses, anthrax and rabies, are known to occur within the study area but were not tested for as we were looking at prior exposure and not active infection. The potential of identifying positive results for those two pathogens would have been highly unlikely because of their extreme pathogenicity [22,23].\n\nThis study was conducted in the Tost Mountains (43\u00b0 N, 100\u00b0 E) in the Gobi Desert in southern Mongolia from 2012 to 2015 (Figure 1). The Tost Mountains cover an area of approximately 1700 km2 and the population of snow leopards, estimated annually, was between 10\u201314 adults during our study [24]. The area is also home to approximately 90 herder families, their goats (Capra aegagrus hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), horses (Equus caballus), camels (Camelus bactrianus) and domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris). Other wild species in the area include the grey wolf (Canis lupus), corsac fox (Vulpes corsac), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), Pallas cat (Otocolobus manul), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), Eurasian wildcat (Felis silvestris) and several members of the mustelid family [24,25]. Ungulates include the Siberian ibex (Capra sibirica) and Argali sheep (Ovis ammon), which are a major component of the snow leopard\u2019s diet, along with livestock [26].\n\n\nTwenty snow leopards were captured and sampled in conjunction with an ongoing radio telemetry study (see [27] for detailed capture methods). Captures were performed under permits from The Mongolian Ministry of Environment and Green Development. Snow leopards were darted and chemically immobilised with a combination of medetomidine and tiletamine-zolazepam with a mean dose rate of 0.02 \u00b1 0.004 mg/kg body mass medetomidine and 2.17 \u00b1 0.45 mg/kg tiletamine-zolazepam [27].\n\nSedation lasted approximately one hour, which permitted fitting of a radio-collar for monitoring snow leopards movements for 12 to 18 months, physical examination and collection of blood samples and external parasites. Atipamezole hydrochloride (Antisedan vet 5 mg/mL, Orion Pharma Animal Health, Espoo, Finland) reverses the effects of medetomidine and was administered intramuscularly to aid a smooth recovery from the sedation when handling was completed [27]. Thorough clinical examinations ascertained the general health and body condition of the snow leopards as outlined below.\n\nDue to lack of a standard method for measuring body condition in snow leopards and limited descriptions for other wild felids [28] we developed a consistent field technique for measuring body condition. This technique was based on the amount of muscle over the shoulders and hips and whether the outline of ribs, scapular spine and iliac crest were visible and could be palpated. If scapular spine and iliac crest of hip bones were prominent, then the body condition was \u2018poor\u2018; if bony prominences were difficult to palpate the body condition was rated \u2018good\u2018. In between these two extremes, body condition was scored as \u2018moderate\u2019. Pelage was examined for thickness, signs of rubbing, alopecia and wounds. Eyes were examined for any sign of injury or defects. The oral cavity, including tongue and gingiva, were inspected for inflammation, ulcers or other lesions. Teeth were also examined as one of the indicators of age, or to see if broken or infected. Age estimation was based on body mass and tooth wear and tooth colouration [27]. The animals develop a darker cream tooth colour as they age. Scarring of the face in males was also used as an approximate indicator of age as younger males (<two-three years) have few or no scars [27]. Presumably older males obtain facial scars from territorial or resource fights. Females that had not apparently reproduced (< three years of age) typically had nipples that were lighter in colour and smaller than those of known reproductive females.\n\nBody weight was recorded and heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature and oxygen saturation was measured at 10-minute intervals during the sedation, to collect physiological data and as a routine measure of physiological stability while sedated. A pulse oximeter was attached to one ear to measure the oxygen saturation. Many of the captures took place at night at low ambient temperatures and as thermoregulation can be compromised by sedation, body temperature was closely monitored while the animal was sedated to ensure it did not drop below physiologically accepted levels [29].\n\nTwenty millilitres of blood was collected from the cephalic vein. Two millilitre aliquots were placed into three separate, two millilitres blood serum separating tubes (Interpath Services PTY Ltd, Heidelberg West, Australia) for later serology analyses. Five millilitres of blood was placed into a tube with ethanol for DNA analyses and one millilitre into a lithium heparin tube for haematology and biochemistry. The remainder of the blood sample was placed on Nobuto strips (10 per animal), which hold 0.1ml of whole blood or 0.04ml of serum (Toyo Roshi Kaisha, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and Whatman FTA cards (one per animal) (GE Healthcare UK Limited, Little Chalfont, UK). The advantage of both the Nobuto strips and Whatman FTA cards are they can be stored at room temperature. The FTA cards and Nobuto strips were air dried and stored in paper envelopes.\n\nBlood smears were made in the field from each blood sample collected, then fixed in Diff Kwik fixative at our campsite (Fronine Laboratory Supplies, Riverstone, Australia). Serum tubes stood overnight to separate cells and serum. Serum was decanted into sterile cryovials and held at \u221218\u00b0C until transport to the National Veterinary Institute in Uppsala, Sweden for storage at \u221280\u00b0C until they were tested six to twelve months later.\n\nExternal parasites were collected during physical exam of the pelage and placed in ethanol for later testing for bacterial pathogens as explained below.\n\nBlood smears were stained with Diff Kwik (eosin and methylene blue) and microscopically examined at 40x and 100x (oil) magnification for cellular abnormalities and haemoparasites.\n\nSnow leopard serum samples were tested for the presence of antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii, Coxiella burnetii and Leptospira spp. utilising Enzyme-Linked-Immuno-Assay (ELISA). If positive results were obtained for Leptospira spp. the samples were then tested using Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) against a panel of serovars. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was used to screen ticks for bacteria (Table 2.). Details of these analyses are outlined below.\n\nAntibodies against T. gondii were detected using a commercially available ABNOVA IgG antibody ELISA kit (ABNOVA, Taipei City, Taiwan). As this was a human kit, the methods were modified accordingly. The enzyme conjugate in the kit was changed to an Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated affinipure Goat Anti-Cat IgG (H + L). The methods also called for a 1:40 dilution of the test sample, but as the samples were already diluted 1:10, they only required an additional four-time dilution. All ELISA plates were read on a Multiskan FC microplate photometer, Thermo Scientific machine at 450 nm. Results were calculated by methods outlined in the kit guide.\n\nLeptospira antibodies were first identified using a commercially available ELISA kit Leptospira IgG (LS-IgG) ELISA kit, (MBS036971, Mybiosource, San Diego, USA). As this was a rodent test kit the conjugating enzyme was replaced with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated AffiniPur Goat Anti-Cat IgG (H + L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. West Grove, USA) Leptospira serovars were then identified using the Microscopic Agglutination Test- MAT [30]. The MAT panel the samples were tested against consisted of Leptospira serovars: L. interrogans sv Australis, L. kirschneri sv Grippotyphosa, L. interrogans sv Icterohaemorrhagiae, L. interrogans sv Pomona, L. interrogans sv Hebdomadis and L. interrogans sv Canicola. These serovars were chosen as they had previously been reported to occur in other regions of Mongolia [31,32]. The antigens used were live cultures of referenced strains. All sera that gave a positive reaction at a 1:100 dilution were further titrated in serial two-fold dilutions to titre endpoint that is 50% agglutination. A titre \u2265 100 was therefore deemed positive to exposure to leptospires.\n\nAntibodies against C. burnetii were detected using an Innovative Diagnostics Q Fever Indirect Multi-species ELISA kit. The ELISA was performed following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The plate results were read at 450 nm, with positive or negative results calculated as described in the kit instructions (Idvet, 310, Grabels. France).\n\nTicks were analysed using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) [33]. These analyses detect bacterial genera present, as well as endosymbionts or opportunists. Each tick was manually minced with a sterilized scalpel. Three treatments were performed to allow a better harvest of gram-positive bacterial DNA. First, samples were immersed for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C in an enzymatic lysis buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris\u00b7Cl, pH 8.0, 2 mM sodium EDTA, 1.2% Triton\u00ae X-100 and 20 mg/ml of lysozyme as described in the Dneasy\u2122 Tissue Kit handbook. Second, samples were submitted to three freeze-thaw cycles [34]. Finally, 25\u00b5l of proteinase K and 200\u00b5l of buffer A was added to the sample before an overnight shaking incubation at 56\u00b0C. Two hundred \u00b5l of this mix was then introduced in a QIAcube (Qiagen\u00ae, Hilden) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol for purification of total DNA from animal tissues. After the extraction step, we performed an Illumina amplicon sequencing following a modified Miseq protocols (16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation). One extraction of the negative control was added to every batch of 24 samples and two additional negative controls were added to the PCR steps. A mock community sample (HM-783D, BEI resources) containing genomic DNA from 20 bacterial strains at concentrations ranging between 0.6 and 1400pg/\u00b5l was also added in triplicate to confirm the reliability of our method. Purified products were quantified using Quant-iT\u2122 PicoGreen\u00ae dsDNA Assay Kit following the manufacturer protocol on a fluorimeter (FilterMax F3, Molecular Devices). Quantified products were then pooled in equimolarity and sent to the GIGA Genomics platform (Ulg) for sequencing on an ILLUMINA MiSeq V2 benchtop sequencer [35,36].\n\nAll of the captured snow leopards appeared to be in good physical condition and healthy except for one adult female (ID F9) that weighed 32 kg and that was scored to be in poor to moderate body condition. Her body weight was lower than recorded averages for adult females in this study (Table 1) with bony prominences (scapular spine, ribs and iliac crest) were easily palpable. From her tooth wear, she was determined to be an older animal. Despite the poor to moderate condition, she was negative for antibodies to the tested pathogens and was reproducing. She was later detected on camera trap records together with two cubs and survived for at least 15 months before her collar dropped off and she could no longer be monitored. No ocular lesions or eyelid deformities were present in the animals examined. Oral cavities were clear of ulcers, other visible lesions or gingivitis. Physiological parameters measured from the snow leopards are presented in Table 1. This table combines data reported in Johansson et al. [27] with data from two snow leopards that has not been previously reported.\n\n\nKnown survival times for snow leopards after the first capture and sample collection was based on how long collars stayed on and how many times they were recaptured. The length of time that the snow leopards were collared ranged from four to 58 months with an average of 20.1 months. Seven of the collared snow leopards had died by the end of this study. Four of these were suspected to have been killed by people when raiding night-time corrals and their collars destroyed. The remaining three animals died of unknown causes\n\nAll cellular components in each of the blood smears (red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets) were normal in appearance when viewed under a microscope at 40 x magnification and 100 x (oil immersion). Extra- or intra-cellular haemoparasites were not observed.\n\nFour of 20 snow leopards (20%) were seropositive for T. gondii (M1, M9, M11 and F7). Five snow leopards (25%) (M4, M10, F1, F7 and F8) were seropositive for Coxiella burnetii and four leopards (20%), (F5, M6, M11, M7) were seropositive for Leptospira spp. L. interrogans sv. Australis was identified in two snow leopards in 2013 (F5, M7) but the other two samples (M6, M11) were not positive in MAT.\n\nFour ticks were collected, from four different snow leopards (F8, M4, M7, M1). One hundred and sixteen genera of bacteria were identified in total from the ticks, with the potentially significant zoonotic bacteria listed in Table 2.\n\nDisease threats to endangered species tend to be overlooked in light of more apparent threats such as habitat destruction and poaching [72]. This study is the first to detect exposure of wild snow leopards to zoonotic pathogens. Potential sources of the three pathogens identified that is Coxiella burnetii, Toxoplasma gondii and Leptospira interrogans Australis, include snow leopard prey such as wild and domestic ungulates and overlap with scavengers, such as raptors and foxes at kill sites, allowing indirect interactions with other potential hosts and the pathogens they shed. Such potential indirect interactions could include sharing of common resources that are contaminated with pathogens such as water bodies and being parasitized by water-borne pathogens.\n\nThere was no evidence of adverse impacts of the zoonotic pathogens on the health and reproduction of the snow leopards in the Tost Mountains. Identification of these pathogens was based on antibody identification from prior exposure and not an active infection. For species where there is limited information, such as the snow leopard, there is a distinct need to continue long-term monitoring of their health to generate comprehensive baseline knowledge of what are normal parameters. Monitoring the survival and condition of animals over time can be achieved through radio-collaring, continual collection and testing of samples as per this study. Only through continued monitoring, including disease surveillance, can we start to understand the threats to this endangered species."}
