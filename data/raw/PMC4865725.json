{"title": "SARS coronavirus papain-like protease induces Egr-1-dependent up-regulation of TGF-\u03b21 via ROS/p38 MAPK/STAT3 pathway", "body": "Human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM; HyClone Laboratories, Logan, Utah, USA) with 100 U/mL of penicillin and streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel). SARS-CoV PLpro gene, nt 4507\u20135840 of the SARS-CoV TW1 strain (GenBank accession no. AY291451) was amplified by RT-PCR, and then cloned into expression vector pcDNA3.1/His C (Invitrogen), as described in our prior reports1213. The empty vector pcDNA3.1 or pSARS-PLpro at the concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 \u03bcg/ml was transfected into A549 cells with Arrest-In transfection reagent (Thermo scientific). After 5-h incubation, transfected cells were maintained in DMEM medium containing 20% FBS. Transient expression of recombinant PLpro in A549 cells 2 days post transfection was analyzed using immunefluoresce staining and Western blotting with mouse polyclonal antibodies against anti-E. coli synthesized PLpro, as described in our prior reports1213.\n\nTo measure the expression of SARS PLpro, TGF-\u03b21, pro-fibrotic and pro-protein convertase genes in transfected cells or mouse lung tissues, total RNAs were extracted from transfected A549 cells with empty vector pcDNA3.1 or pSARS-PLpro 2 days post transfection using PureLink Micro-to-Midi Total RNA Purification System kit (Invitrogen). Relative mRNA levels were analyzed using two-step real time RT-PCR with SYBR Green I, as described in our prior reports1112. Primer pairs of SARS PLpro, TGF-\u03b21, pro-fibrotic and pro-protein convertase genes were listed in Table 1. Quantification of specific PCR products was performed using the ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems). Relative changes in mRNA level of indicated genes were normalized relative to GAPDH mRNA.\n\nFor determining the expression of PLpro and TGF-\u03b21 as well as nuclear translocalization of transcription factors, A549 cells transiently transfected with pSARS-PLpro or empty vector grew on the glass coverslip in 6-well at 37 \u00b0C. After 2 days incubation, transfected cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for the other 1 h, and then incubated with specific primary antibodies at 4 \u00b0C overnight, including mouse anti-SARS PLpro, rabbit anti-TGF-\u03b21 (Cell signaling), rabbit anti-NF-\u03baB p65 (Abcam), rabbit anti-Sp-1, rabbit anti-Egr-1 (Cell Signaling), and rabbit anti-vimentin (GeneTex). Subsequently, cells were reacted with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG plus DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) in dark box for 2 h. After washing three times with PBS, photographs of stained cells were taken using the immunofluorescence microscopy (Olympus, BX50).\n\nTo determine protein expression and phosphorylation status, transfected A549 cells with empty vector pcDNA3.1 or pSARS-PLpro were harvested 2 days after transfection. Western blotting of cell lysates was accomplished, as described in our prior reports1213. Resulting blots were probed with primary antibodies, including mouse polyclonal anti-E. coli synthesized PLpro, rabbit anti-vimentin (GeneTex), rabbit anti-TGF-\u03b21 (Cell signaling), anti-\u03b1-SMA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-Egr-1, anti-phospho Erk1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-phospho p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), anti-phospho STAT3 (Ser727) (Cell Signaling), and anti-\u03b2-actin mAb (Abcam). Immune complexes were detected using HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies, as well as enhanced chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore).\n\nTo test the activation of TGF-\u03b21 promoter by SARS-CoV PLpro, PLpro-expressing and empty vector control cells were co-transfected with TGF-\u03b21 promoter firefly luciferase reporter plasmids and internal control Renilla luciferase reporter pRluc-C1, as we reported earlier12. Full-length of truncated forms of TGF-\u03b21 promoter plasmids (phTG1 \u22121362/+11, phTG5 \u2212453/+11, phTG6 \u2212323/+11, phTG7 \u2212175/+11, phTG7-4 \u221260/+11) were kindly provided by Dr. S. J. Kim (CHA University, Republic of Korea)23. Mutated TGF-\u03b21 promoter plasmid phTG5(Sp-1 mut), also named as Sp1mut \u2212216/\u2212215, was a kind gift from Prof. C. Weigert (University of Tuebingen, Germany)24. The activity of firefly and Renilla luciferase was measured 1 day post transient transfection by dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and the Clarity\u2122 Luminescence Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments).\n\nPLpro-expressing and empty vector control cells were harvested 1 day post transient transfection, then stained with 10 \u03bcM 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA, Sigma) at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min in darkroom. Final, DCFH-DA was converted to the fluorescent form DCF by ROS, DCF fluorescence represented as an intracellular ROS level was measured using flow cytometry with excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 530 nm (Becton Dickinson FACS Calibur), as described in our prior report25.\n\nFor inhibitor treatment, vector control and PLpro-expressing cells were incubated with SB-431542 (TGF-\u03b21 receptor inhibitor) (Tocris Bioscience), YCG063 (ROS inhibitor), SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor), PD98059 (ERK1/2 inhibitor) (Calbiochem), and Stattic (STAT3 inhibitor) (Axon Medchem) at indicated concentrations, and then harvested for Western blotting and real-time RT-PCR, as described above. For the silence of Egr-1 and Rac1, vector control and PLpro-expressing cells were transfected with non-targeting control or Egr-1 siRNA (SMARTpool siRNA) (Thermo Scientific), and then harvested 24 h post transfection for Western blotting and real-time RT-PCR.\n\nThe mouse mode with a direct chest injection (Protocol No. 101-194-N) was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at China Medical University. The animal use protocols were performed in accordance with the approved guidelines. Approximately 100 \u03bcl of 3% sucrose in PBS containing 50 \u03bcg of pSARS-PLpro, empty vector or solvent alone were injected into a right chest of mouse using a 1-ml syringe with a 28-gage needle every 2 days. Each group of 5 eight-weeks-old BALB/c male mice was injected 15 times, and then sacrificed. The lung tissues of each mouse in indicated groups were collected for immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and SYBR Green real time RT-PCR, respectively. For IHC staining, mouse lung tissues were fixed in formaldehyde and dehydrated in 70% ethanol for 30 min, in 95% ethanol for 30 min, and finally in 100% ethanol for 30 min. The tissues were embedded in paraffin at 58 \u00b0C, then cut at 4\u201315 \u03bcm thick section using a rotary microtome. Before staining, the sections were floated in a 56 \u00b0C water bath and mounted the sections onto slides. The slides with paraffin embedded section of mouse lung tissue were dewaxed in xylene 2 times for 5 min, rehydrated in 100% ethanol for 1 min, in 90% ethanol for 1 min, and finally in 80% ethanol for 1 min. Slides with mouse lung tissues were incubated in 3%H2O2 for 1 min to remove endogenous peroxidase activity, washed with PBS, and heated with 100 \u00b0C EDTA pH 9.0 for 20 min to induce antigen retrieval. Subsequently, slides were blocked with a protein block solution, and incubated with primary antibodies for 30 min, including mouse anti-E. coli synthesized PLpro serum, anti-mouse CD11b, anti-mouse TGF\u03b21 (Cell signaling), and anti-mouse vimentin (GeneTex). After washing with PBS, slides were reacted with Polymer-HRP for 20 min, developed using DAB substrate, and counterstained with hematoxylin. For collagen determination, the tissue sections were stained with Sirius red solution for 2 h, and then rinsed 10 times with 0.5% glacial acetic acid in PBS. After dehydrating with ethanol, stained sections were mounted on the glass slides, and then examined using light microscopy (Olympus, BX50). For quantitating relative mRNA levels, mouse tissue was homogenized, and performed as above described. Primer pairs of mouse TGF-\u03b21 and pro-fibrotic genes were listed in Table 1.\n\nAll data were calculated from 3 independent experiments. Student\u2019s t-test or \u03c72 test was used to analyze all data. Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05.\n\nOur prior study demonstrated SARS-CoV PLpro triggering the TGF\u03b21 production in human promonocytes13, whether SARS PLpro induced TGF-\u03b21 production in human lung epithelial A549 cells was further examined. Transient transfection of A549 cells with empty vector or pSARS-PLpro was performed to analyze the TGF-\u03b21 production induced by SARS PLpro. Quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blotting indicated transfection with pSARS-PLpro increasing the mRNA and protein levels of PLpro in A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, but not empty control vector (Fig. 1A\u2013D). Meanwhile, relative mRNA levels of TGF-\u03b21 in A549 cells were time- and concentration-dependently elevated following the transient transfection with pSARS-PLpro, but not vector control (Fig. 2A). Immunofluorescence staining assays indicated the protein levels of TGF-\u03b21 obviously heightening in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro compared to vector control (Fig. 2B). For examining the TGF-\u03b21 induction of SARS-CoV PLpro in different cell lines, Huh7 (human hepatocarcinoma), H1299 (human non-small cell lung carcinoma), and ca9-22 (human oral cancer) cells were also evaluated (Supplemental Fig. 1). Real-time RT PCR analysis of transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro indicated that a lower level of TGF-\u03b21 mRNA was detected in transfected H1299 cells compared to transfected A549 cells, but no significant level was found in transfected Huh7 and ca9-22 cells. In addition, comparison of the expression levels of PLpro and TGF-\u03b21 among transfected cells with empty vector, pSARS-PLpro, and pBAC-SARSCoV\u0394ES (a non-infectious SARS-CoV replicon) was further performed (Supplemental Fig. 2). The expression level of PLpro in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro was 25-fold higher than the cells transfected with pBAC-SARSCoV\u0394ES. A dose-dependent increase of TGF-\u03b21 mRNA levels in A549 cells was induced by pSARS-PLpro and pBAC-SARSCoV\u0394ES, respectively. Meanwhile, recombinant plasmids containing PLpro genes of MERS-CoV and HCoV NL63 (pMERS-PLpro, and pNL63-PLpro) were used for testing the specificity on the TGF-\u03b21 induction compared to pSARS-PLpro (Supplemental Fig. 3). Interestingly, only SARS-CoV PLpro, but not ERS-CoV and HCoV NL63 PLpro, dose-dependently up-regulated the mRNA expression of TGF-\u03b21. Therefore, the result demonstrated that SARS-CoV PLpro plays an important role in triggering a significant increase of TGF-\u03b21 mRNA and protein levels in human lung epithelial cells.\n\nTo evaluate the correlation between TGF-\u03b21 production and pro-fibrotic gene expression in PLpro-expressing cells, mRNA and protein levels of pro-fibrotic genes such as vimentin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in transfected cells were assessed using quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting (Fig. 3). The mRNA levels of vimentin and GFAP were up-regulated in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro, but not vector control (Fig. 3A,B). Besides, Western blotting showed the plasmid dose-dependent increase of vimentin proteins in PLpro-expressing cells, but not in vector controls (Fig. 3C,D). Next, a selective inhibitor of TGF-\u03b21 receptor (SB-431542) was used to test the association of pro-fibrotic gene up-regulation with the TGF-\u03b21 induction in PLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 3E). SB-431542 exhibited a dose-dependently inhibitory effect on SARS-PLpro-induced expression of vimentin (Fig. 3D). The result demonstrated SARS-CoV PLpro initiating TGF-\u03b21-dependent up-regulation of pro-fibrotic genes in human lung epithelial cells.\n\nTo further examine the mechanism of TGF-\u03b21 promoter activation induced by PLpro, wild type (phTG1), deletion (phTG5, phTG6, phTG7, phTG7-4), or mutant (phTG5(Sp1mut)) variants of TGF-\u03b21 promoter-firefly luciferase reporters were used to examine the critical region for activation of TGF-\u03b21 promoter in PLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 4A). In dual luciferase reporter assays, vector and PLpro-expressing cells were co-transfected with an internal control Renilla luciferase reporter and indicated TGF-\u03b21 promoter-firefly luciferase reporter. Dual luciferase reporter assays indicated greater than 1.8-fold increases of firefly leucuferase activity by phTG1, phTG5, phTG6, phTG7, and phTG5(Sp1mut) respectively in PLpro-expressing cells than vector control cells (Fig. 4B). However, PLpro did not trigger the activation of TGF-\u03b21 promoter deletion form phTG7-4. The result indicated the promoter region between \u2212175 to \u221260, the Egr-1/Sp-1 binding site, as responsible for PLpro-induced activation of TGF-\u03b21 promoter-firefly luciferase.\n\nTo further investigate the nuclear localization of NF-\u03baB, Sp-1 and Egr-1, both types of cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining with primary and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies, plus DAPI nuclear counterstain (Fig. 5). Immunofluorescence imaging analysis indicated NF-\u03baB and Sp-1 were localized in the nucleus as well as Erg-1 was localized in the cytoplasm of vector control cells (Fig. 5A\u2013C). However, PLpro stimulated the translocation of Erg-1 into the nucleus, but inactivated the NF-\u03baB and Sp-1 that were localized in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex (Fig. 5A\u2013C). The finding correlated with the previous report in that SARS CoV PLpro has the inhibitory ability on the activation of NF-\u03baB into nucleus10. In addition, Western blotting indicated SARS-CoV PLpro causing the increased expression of Egr-1 in plasmid dose-dependent manners (Fig. 5D,E). Subsequently, gene silencing of Erg-1 by RNA interference was performed to examine the role of Egr-1 in PLpro-induced up-regulation of TGF-\u03b21 and pro-fibrotic responses (Fig. 6). Egr-1 siRNA, not non-targeting siRNA, definitely reduced mRNA and protein levels of Egr-1, TGF-\u03b21, vimentin and \u03b1-SMA in PLpro-expressing cells, but slightly decreased them in vector control cells. The result demonstrated gene silencing of Egr1 linked with the decrease of TGF-\u03b21 promoter activation and pro-fibrotic responses in PLpro-expressing cells. The finding revealed Egr-1 up-regulated by SARS-CoV PLpro playing a crucial role in the activation of TGF-\u03b21 promoter, as well as the induction of TGF-\u03b21-mediated pro-fibrotic responses in SARS pathogenesis.\n\nTo examine the expression of pro-protein convertases, relative mRNA levels of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), furin, matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) and MMP9 were measured in vector control and PLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 7). Quantitative PCR analysis indicated that TSP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were up-regulated in PLpro-expressing cells versus vector control (Fig. 7A). Interestingly, the inhibitor of TGF-\u03b21 receptor (SB-431542) significantly reduced PLpro-induced expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 at baseline, but partially inhibited the expression of TSP-1 (Fig. 7A). The finding implied bioactive TGF-\u03b21 induced by PLpro directly stimulated the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, and also associated with the TSP-1 up-regulation. In addition, the correlation between the expression levels of Egr-1 and TSP-1 induced by PLpro was further examined (Fig. 7B). Egr-1 gene silencing significantly reduced the mRNA expression of TSP-1 in PLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 7B). The results indicated that Egr-1-dependent up-regulation of TSP-1 as well as TGF-\u03b21-mediated activation of MMP2, MMP9, and TSP-1 expressions were responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of latent TGF-\u03b2 in PLpro-expressing cells.\n\nSince the intracellular ROS generation was reported to modulate the expression of Egr-1 and TSP-12627, the involvement of ROS-mediated pathway in PLpro-induced Egr-1-depedent activation of TGF-\u03b21 and pro-fibrotic responses was explored (Figs 8, 9, 10). Intracellular ROS levels in PLpro-expressing and vector control cells were detected using flow cytometry with DCFH-DA staining (Fig. 8A). DCF fluorescence analysis indicated PLpro triggered the ROS generation in a dose dependent manner. Meanwhile, ROS inhibitor (YCG063) concentration-dependently reduced PLpro-induced up-regulation of Egr-1 and TSP-1(Fig. 8B). For insight into the pathway of ROS-mediated Egr-1 up-regulation, the activity of MAP kinases and transcription factors were analyzed using Western blotting (Fig. 9A,B). ROS inhibitor (YCG063) significantly reduced PLpro-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and STAT3. Furthermore, p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) notably declined the PLpro-induced expression of Egr-1, TGF-\u03b21 and vimentin, as well as PLpro-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 (Figs 9C and 10A,B). STAT3 inhibitor (Stattic) also diminished PLpro-induced expression of Egr-1, vimentin, and Type I collagen (Fig. 10C). Therefore, results showed SARS-CoV PLpro up-regulating Egr-1 dependent TGF-\u03b21 mediated pro-fibrosis via ROS/p38 MAPK/STAT3 pathway.\n\nA mouse model that direct injected with empty vector or pSARS-PLpro into the mouse lung was set up for examining the pro-fibrotic activity of PLpro in vivo (Fig. 11). The mice were injected 15 times with indicated plasmids into the chest every two days (Fig. 11A), and then sacrificed and collected the lung tissue for tissue immunohistochemistry stain and quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 11B,C). Immunohistochemistry staining with anti-PLpro immunized sera indicated a significant expression of SARS-PLpro in lung tissues of mice injected with pSARS-PLpro, but not empty vector or solvent control (Fig. 11B). Lung infiltration of immune cells, particular CD11b monocytes, was identified in pulmonary alveoli expressing SARS-PLpro, but not the controls, using immunohistochemistry staining with anti-mouse CD11b mAb. In addition, PLpro, but not the controls triggered a significant increase of TGF-\u03b21 and vimentin protein levels in the lung tissues. Subsequently, real-time PCR confirmed PLpro raised the mRNA expression of Egr-1, TSP-1, TGF-\u03b21, and vimentin in mouse lung tissues versus empty vector or solvent control (Fig. 11C). Overall, result of the in vivo experiments was in accord with the in vitro data that SARS PLpro substantially stimulated Egr-1 dependent TGF-\u03b21 mediated pro-fibrotic responses.\n\nThis study verified SARS-CoV PLpro inducing TGF-\u03b21 mediated pro-fibrotic responses in human lung epithelial cells and mouse lung tissues (Figs 1, 2, 3 and 11), according with the previous report in that PLpro up-regulated TGF-\u03b21 and its associated genes such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin13. Except SARS-CoV nucleocapsid28, PLpro was identified to generate the TGF-\u03b21 production that linked to activate the pro-fibrotic responses. Among SARS-CoV-induced cytokines56, TGF-\u03b21 could be associated with the induction of lung fibrosis. Therefore, SARS-CoV PLpro plays an important role in the TGF-\u03b21-mediated pulmonary fibrosis of SARS pathogenesis.\n\nThis study proved SARS-CoV-PLpro heightening the role of Egr-1 in TGF-\u03b21-mediated pro-fibrosis, in which increased the expression and nuclear translocalization of Egr-1, as well as strengthened the transcription of Egr-1-responsive genes (TGF-\u03b21 and TSP-1) (Figs 5, 6, 7). In addition, gene silencing by siRNA confirmed the importance of Egr-1 on TGF-\u03b21-mediated pro-fibrosis induced by PLpro (Fig. 6). Previous studies demonstrated Egr-1 exhibiting potent stimulatory action on fibrotic gene expression, and correlating with human fibrotic disorders like emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis, and systemic sclerosis2930. Those results revealed TGF-\u03b2 increasing Egr-1 protein and mRNA levels, stimulating Egr-1-depdent transcription of collagen, and then triggering Smad-independent fibrotic response. However, our study indicated SARS-CoV PLpro causing Egr-1-depdent transcription of TGF-\u03b21, in which was associated with TGF-\u03b21-mediated up-regulation of pro-fibrotic genes (such as vimentin, GFAP, and \u03b1-SMA). Of pro-protein convertases192021, Egr-1 dependent up-regulation of TSP-1 in PLpro-expressing cells was discovered (Figs 7B and 8B), in which TSP-1 was suggested as responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of latent TGF-\u03b21. The finding directed the alternative role of Egr-1 in TGF-\u03b21 induction and TSP-1-mediated latent TGF-\u03b21 activation in PLpro-expressing cells versus vector controls. Therefore, Egr-1 plays an important mediator in SARS CoV PLpro-induced pro-fibrotic response, appearing as a potential target for anti-fibrotic therapies in SARS patients.\n\nThe study identified ROS/p38 MAPK/STAT3/Egr-1 pathway involving in PLpro-induced TGF-\u03b21-mediated pro-fibrotic response (Fig. 12). The unique pathway has been confirmed using specific inhibitors of ROS (YCG063), p38 MAPK (SB203580) and STAT3 (Stattic) (Figs 8, 9, 10), as in accord with our previous report in that SARS-CoV PLpro triggered TGF-\u03b21 production via p38 MAPK mediated signaling in human promonocytes13. In addition, ROS was associated with the up-regulation and activation of Egr-1 in hypoxia induced pulmonary fibrosis, hypertension, apoptosis, and atherosclerosis2631. The Egr-1 promoter consists of several functional response elements (such as serum response element (SRE), cAMP response element (CREs), APETALA1 (AP1), gene-specific activator protein 1 (Sp1), and Ets-family transcription factor binding sites)31. Several pathways of ROS-mediated Egr-1 up-regulation were identified, including MEK/ERK, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), ERK-1/2-Elk-1 and NF-kappaB3132. The increase of ROS production generally activated MAPK pathways (ERKs, JNKs, or p38 MAPKs) in response to growth factors, cytokines, and various stresses33. In addition, the interaction between MAPK and STAT3 has been demonstrated in lipopolysaccharide-triggered inflammatory lung diseases34. Therefore, ROS/p38 MAPK/STAT3 was reasonably responsible for the Egr-1 upregulation of TGF-\u03b21-mediated pro-fibrotic response induced by SARS-CoV PLpro.\n\nIn conclusion, SARS-CoV PLpro significantly induced the TGF-\u03b21-mediated pro-fibrotic response via ROS/p38 MAPK/STAT3/Egr-1 pathway in vitro and in vivo. PLpro also triggered Egr-1 dependent transcription of TSP-1 as an important role in latent TGF-\u03b21 activation. Therefore, Egr-1 plays a critical mediator in SARS-CoV PLpro induced pathogenesis, as a potential therapeutic target to prevent the pulmonary fibrosis induced by SARS-CoV.\n\nHow to cite this article: Li, S.-W. et al.
