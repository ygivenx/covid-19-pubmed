{"title": "Next-Generation Sequencing Reveals HIV-1-Mediated Suppression of T Cell Activation and RNA Processing and Regulation of Noncoding RNA Expression in a CD4+ T Cell Line", "body": "The hallmark of AIDS is the loss of CD4+ T cells, the primary target of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Infected CD4+ T cells undergo fundamental changes that eventually result in cell death and the release of new virus particles (reviewed in references 1 and 2). Following the uptake of virus, the viral genome is reverse transcribed and integrated into the host genome. The host machinery is then used to produce viral transcripts that are either spliced into smaller transcripts that serve as the template for viral proteins or left unspliced to be incorporated into new virus particles. Microarray analyses have shown that infected cells respond to these assaults with gene expression changes in a number of pathways, including apoptosis, cell cycle, cholesterol biosynthesis, and inflammation (3\u20135; reference 1 and references therein).\n\nMany of these cellular responses are also reflected at the level of the host organism. For example, gene expression in the lymph nodes of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected Asian pig-tailed macaques (a model of pathogenic HIV infection) reflects strong and sustained type I interferon responses (6). A similar initial interferon response is seen in the natural host, African green monkeys, but it eventually subsides and the infection resolves (6). Despite intense investigation into the molecular events following infection in these and other studies, fundamental gaps in knowledge still remain. For instance, the extent to which host and viral gene expression respond to each other is still poorly understood. New technologies enabling the measurement of both host and viral RNA may help to address such shortcomings.\n\nIn this study, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to examine changes in the transcriptome of T cells infected with replication-competent HIV. NGS offers a number of benefits for the study of host-pathogen interactions. Increased sensitivity and accuracy over microarrays allow important events such as the initial host response to viral replication to be studied in greater detail (7). Also, host and viral RNA transcripts can be assayed simultaneously, rather than on separate technical platforms, allowing greater reproducibility and increased confidence in the results. Finally, because NGS allows total RNA to be assayed, insights are not limited to annotated transcripts or even protein-coding genes. Indeed, previous work in our group has shown that many noncoding RNA species are differentially expressed in virus-infected cells (8).\n\nWe report here the effects of HIV-1 infection on the expression of polyadenylated RNAs in a CD4+ T cell line. Using NGS, we detected small but significant changes in host gene expression affecting T cell function that coincided with the initiation of viral RNA production at 12 h postinfection (hpi). These changes intensified near peak viral replication at 24 hpi when a multitude of other host processes were disrupted as well. In addition, by using NGS, we observed the dramatic expansion of viral mRNA expression and detected new viral splice events occurring during viral replication and differential expression of noncoding RNA species, including microRNA host genes. These findings provide an unprecedented and comprehensive view into the transcriptome-level changes that occur within T cells infected with replicating HIV.\n\nIn this study, we investigated changes in host and viral transcription occurring in a T lymphoblast-based model of HIV infection. SUP-T1 cells (5 \u00d7 106) were infected in triplicate with HIV-1 strain LAI at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 which resulted in near-complete infection at 24 hours postinfection (hpi). The phenotype of infected cells (including appearance, viability, and the amount of viral mRNA and protein) was used to guide the selection of samples for NGS. At 12 hpi, viral mRNA could be detected in infected cells at appreciable levels (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Few cells expressed the viral antigen p24 Gag, and visually, the cells appeared to be intact. By 24 hpi, high copy numbers of viral mRNA were present (Fig. S1). Nearly all cells showed the presence of p24 Gag antigen, syncytia were observed, and nonsyncytial cells had increased in volume. By 28 hpi, the effects of viral infection were more pronounced. The amount of viral RNA peaked (Fig. S1), and cell viability decreased. The bulk of cell death occurred between 32 and 48 hpi.\n\nOn the basis of these observations, we selected two time points to analyze by NGS: 12 and 24 hpi concurrent with the beginning of viral RNA accumulation and the occurrence of near-peak RNA levels prior to cell death, respectively. We isolated RNA from infected and mock-infected replicate cell samples at these two time points, created cDNA libraries from polyadenylated RNA, and subjected the libraries to analysis by NGS. For each sample, we obtained on average over 21 million 75-nucleotide (nt) reads mapping to either HIV or human genomes. A large number of reads mapped to the viral genome (2.5 to 8 million depending on the time point, see Table S1 in the supplemental material). By 12 hpi, viral reads constituted ~18% of the total mapped reads, and by 24 hpi, this proportion increased to ~38%. Reads mapping to the viral genome indicated the presence of RNA splicing events. In addition to splicing events involving known splice sites, we also observed evidence of five splicing events involving one or more previously unobserved splice sites (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). We tested the presence of one of these sites (located 3\u2032 of the annotated splice acceptor site 2) by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and observed an amplicon size consistent with the usage of the site (Fig. S2A to S2C).\n\nTo characterize the host response to HIV infection, we mapped the remaining nonviral reads to RefSeq-annotated human gene loci and quantified them as FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments). We selected a set of 34 host genes whose expression spanned a range of values and measured the expression levels directly by qPCR (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). Measurements by NGS showed a high degree of correlation with qPCR results at both time points (R = 0.97 and R = 0.98 at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively), indicating a close match between the two methods. We then identified specific host genes that were differentially expressed (DE) during infection. Comparing FPKM for each gene in infected cells to time-matched mock-infected cells, we found that a total of 106 genes were DE at 12 hpi (representing all fold changes with Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted P values of less than 0.05; Table 1). By 24 hpi, the number of DE genes had increased to 5,006 representing over 50% of all 9,992 gene loci detected under stringent criteria (Table 1). Closer examination of these values showed that a large proportion of DE genes occurred with small-magnitude changes. In particular, 69% (73 of 106) and 49% (2,465 of 5,006) of the expressed genes exhibited 1- to 1.5-fold changes at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively (Table 1). The observed precision of the sequencing-based measurements (Fig. S3) supported the use of low-fold change thresholds. Other values for the statistical threshold were also used, and for all but the most stringent thresholds (when fewer than 10 genes were observed to be up- or downregulated at 12 hpi), a similar predominance of small-magnitude changes was observed (see Table S2 in the supplemental material).\n\nComparing the directionality of change at both time points, we found that nearly all of the DE genes at 12 hpi continued to be regulated in the same manner (i.e., up- or downregulated) at 24 hpi. Specifically, 97 of the 106 DE genes at 12 hpi were also DE at 24 hpi (with Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted P < 0.05), and the majority of these (95 of 97) exhibited the same direction of change relative to mock infection, often with increased degree of change (as indicated by more-intense red or green coloration at 24 hpi than at 12 hpi in a heat map of FPKM fold changes, Fig. 1). This indicated that regulation coincident with the beginning of viral replication at 12 hpi largely persisted and intensified near peak viral replication at 24 hpi, even for initially low fold changes.\n\nWe determined the possible impact of these DE genes by analyzing the corresponding annotations (biological processes, molecular functions, and pathways) using the NIH DAVID resource. We found that T cell activation and differentiation were the most overrepresented annotations among DE host genes at 12 hpi overall (Fig. 2A). Other annotations associated with DE genes included protein kinase regulation, DNA recombination, and caspase activity regulation (Fig. 2A). In addition, several of the DE genes at 12 hpi encoded transcriptional regulators; these genes include EGR1, KLF13, and MYC. Interestingly, four of the nine genes DE at 12 hpi but not at 24 hpi also encoded transcriptional regulators (CREB3L3, HEXIM1, ZNF660, and ZKSCAN4), indicating regulation specific to early viral replication.\n\nSeven genes contributed to the overrepresentation of T cell activation among DE genes at 12 hpi (BCL11B, CD1D, EGR1, IKZF1, IRF1, RAG1, and SOX4), six of which were downregulated, indicating a net suppression of T cell activation (as T cell differentiation in Fig. 2). Five T cell activation-related DE genes (BCL11B, EGR1, IRF1, IKZF1, and SOX4) encoded transcription factors, some of which had known relevance to HIV infection. For example, the BCL11B gene product binds directly to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) and inhibits LTR expression (9). BCL11B downregulation may therefore allow more efficient HIV-1 replication. Other DE genes related to T cell activation not encoding transcription factors also had known relevance to HIV infection. For example, the CD1D product presents lipid antigens on the surface and is directed by HIV-1 Nef for internalization and degradation (10). Downregulation of CD1D at the mRNA level would further reduce surface expression and facilitate immune evasion.\n\nWe complemented functional analysis in DAVID by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). This method does not rely on the prior determination of DE genes (e.g., by applying a P value threshold) but instead uses a ranked gene list as input and is therefore well suited for identifying annotations among genes with small-magnitude changes in expression (11). GSEA identified additional genes that were downregulated and contributed to the suppression of T cell activation; these genes include the CD2, CD4, CD7, CD28, and SIT1 genes encoding T cell-specific surface molecules (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material). Many of the genes associated with T cell activation in DAVID and GSEA also had roles in other pathways, indicating possible pleiotropic effects (e.g., ADORA2A and RAG1 which also contribute to caspase activity [Fig. 1]).\n\nBy 24 hpi, large-scale changes in the transcriptomes of HIV-infected cells were evident (Table 1; see the heatmap in Fig. S5A in the supplemental material). Consistent with the large number of DE genes at 24 hpi, we found that a wide range of biological processes was affected as determined by further analysis using DAVID (Fig. 2B; complete listing in Table S3 in the supplemental material). T cell activation and differentiation continued to be overrepresented and were associated with an increased number of DE genes (as lymphocyte differentiation [Fig. 2B]). Other fundamental cellular functions associated with DE genes at 24 hpi included DNA metabolism, transcription, mRNA processing and splicing, translation, protein degradation, and cell cycle control (Fig. 2B). This breadth of functional regulation suggests that HIV-1 infection resulted in the effective transcriptional reprogramming of SUP-T1 cells by 24 hpi.\n\nAs was the case at 12 hpi, genes related to T cell activation and differentiation were predominantly downregulated at 24 hpi. All of the T cell activation-related DE genes at 12 hpi continued to exhibit the same direction of change at 24 hpi (Fig. 1). Other T cell activation-related genes DE at 24 hpi included CD3D, CD3Q, and RHOH, all of which encode membrane proteins crucial for T cell receptor function. A network depicting known interactions among proteins encoded by T cell activation-related DE genes at 24 hpi showed two highly connected nodes: LCK (lymphocyte-specific protein kinase) and TP53 (p53), both of which were strongly downregulated at 24 hpi (Fig. 3A). Our observed downregulation of TP53 differed from the upregulation observed in previous microarray studies and may indicate a cell type-specific effect (1). Genes involved in other core T cell functions, such as proliferation, survival, and antigen presentation, were also downregulated at 24 hpi. These genes included CD1D, CD28, CXCR4, TNFRSF4, and TREML2. TOB1 (transducer of ERBB2), a negative regulator of T cell activation, proliferation, and interleukin 2 (IL-2) production, showed increased expression and may contribute to the downregulation observed in other genes (data not shown). A connection between TOB1 expression and HIV-1 infection has not previously been mentioned. Overall, the increased number of DE genes related to T cell activation indicated increased suppression of this pathway by 24 hpi.\n\nGene sets related to ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis were the most overrepresented annotations among DE genes at 24 hpi (Fig. 2B). Ribonucleoproteins contribute to diverse functions within the cell, including microRNA synthesis, ribosomal assembly, and translation (12). This overlap was reflected at the gene level as well. In particular, ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis shared many DE genes at 24 hpi with another top annotation cluster, RNA processing. This set of genes encoding the ribonucleoprotein component of the RNA processing machinery was almost entirely downregulated and included many members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) families. In a network identifying interactions among the proteins encoded by these genes, a number were found to be highly connected (Fig. 3B). One of these was HNRNPA1 whose gene product regulates the splicing of eukaryotic and viral mRNA (13). HNRNPA1 and other hnRNP gene products are known to affect the localization of HIV-1 Gag/Pol mRNA, and their overexpression has previously been shown to reduce HIV-1 replication (Fig. 3B) (14). Other DE genes at 24 hpi related to ribonucleoprotein biogenesis and RNA processing are also known to affect HIV-1 replication directly; these genes include TARDBP (TAR DNA-binding protein 43) whose protein binds the transactivation response (TAR) element of integrated HIV-1 DNA and represses HIV-1 transcription (15\u201317). Downregulation of HNRNPA1, TARDBP, and other related genes may therefore allow more efficient HIV-1 replication in SUP-T1 cells.\n\nThe importance of host regulation of RNA fate was underscored by another cluster of gene sets related to RNA transport (Fig. 2B). Host factors for RNA transport are known to be coopted by HIV-1 to allow the export of unspliced, partially spliced, or fully spliced viral mRNAs out of the nucleus (18). In particular, the host factors Crm1 (exportin 1) and Ran GTPase are used for the export of unspliced viral mRNA, while the host factor NXF1 (nuclear RNA export factor 1) facilitates the export of fully spliced viral mRNA in a Ran-independent manner (19). In our data set, we observed no change in the expression of the Crm1-encoding gene XPO1, but several members of the Ran signaling pathway were downregulated, suggesting that the overall export of unspliced viral RNA was suppressed (see Fig. S5B in the supplemental material; data not shown for XPO1). However, in contrast to other RNA transport-related genes, NXF1 and NXF3 were expressed more highly in infected cells, suggesting that HIV infection may have selectively enhanced the export of fully spliced viral RNA (Fig. S5B).\n\nDespite the presence of an almost equal number of up- and downregulated genes at 24 hpi, relatively few gene sets (functions, processes, or pathways) were associated with upregulated genes. When up- and downregulated DE genes at 24 hpi were analyzed separately, more annotation clusters were observed among downregulated genes (70 versus 13 among upregulated genes with significance defined by modified Fisher\u2019s exact test as P < 0.05). A similar result was obtained by GSEA (see Fig. S6A and S6B in the supplemental material). These results suggested that upregulated genes were distributed across many gene sets with few occurring in particular functions or pathways. Among the few upregulated pathways were stress-activated/Jnk cascade signaling and ion transport (Fig. S6C). Consistent with these observations, HIV-1 Nef has been shown to activate Jnk signaling, ultimately activating the caspase cascade and triggering cell death (20). The triggering of apoptosis at 24 hpi is consistent with our observation that infected cells began to die following the 24-hpi time point.\n\nNotably, innate immunity was absent from the processes associated with DE genes at 12 hpi, suggesting that HIV-1 infection impaired T cell activation while evading virus-sensing mechanisms (Fig. 2A). With the exception of IRF1, which was downregulated at 12 hpi (Fig. 1), interferon response factors (IRFs) (IRF2, IRF3, IRF7, and IRF9) showed no significant change in expression at 12 hpi (data not shown). Furthermore, specific IRF targets, including IRF3 target genes IFI35, IFI44, ISG15, and ISG20, were also not differentially expressed at this time point (21, 22). IRF3 targets were of particular interest, as intact cytoplasmic HIV-1 DNA has been shown to activate IRF3 in CD4+ T cells (23). Our observed lack of IRF3 target gene expression is consistent with previous observations that replicating HIV-1 suppressed IRF3 activity (24). We also examined the levels of inflammation-related genes previously observed to be differentially regulated in HIV infection studies (1): ANXA1, B2M, and CD69 (generally upregulated) and CD53, CD71, IL-13, and IL-16 (generally downregulated). These genes were also either not expressed at detectable levels or unchanged in expression at 12 hpi (data not shown).\n\nInnate immunity and the inflammatory response continued to be absent from the significantly upregulated gene sets at 24 hpi (by GSEA [see Fig. S6A in the supplemental material]). IRF1 was more strongly downregulated at 24 hpi than at 12 hpi, but other IRF genes (IRF2, IRF3, IRF7, and IRF9) continued to show no significant change in expression (Fig. 1; data not shown). In a separate experiment, we confirmed that IRF1 was downregulated at 24 hpi by qPCR (by an average of 44%; data not shown). Other interferon (IFN)-inducible genes were differentially expressed at this time point but in different directions, such as B2M and IFI16 (both downregulated) and IFI30 and ISG20 (both upregulated). This lack of concerted change may have offset the detection of interferon response gene sets as up- or downregulated at 24 hpi by GSEA. Instead, at 24 hpi, the related gene sets of cellular defense and immune response were found to be primarily downregulated (by GSEA [Fig. S6B]). Several of the downregulated genes associated with these gene sets were also associated with T cell activation; these genes include CD1D, CD2, CD28, RAG1, and TNFRSF4 (Fig. S6D). Additional immune response-specific genes downregulated at 24 hpi included IL4 and IL7R, suggesting that HIV-1 may have impaired the ability of infected cells to signal other cells or respond to extracellular cues.\n\nBy mapping sequencing reads to RefSeq transcript annotation, we also observed changes in the expression of several non-protein-coding RNA species. Specifically, reads mapping to RefSeq transcripts that began with NR were considered noncoding. As before, expression of these transcripts was compared between infected and mock-infected samples. At 12 hpi, only one annotated noncoding RNA (NR_003697 encoding C7orf40) was found to be differentially expressed (Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted P < 0.05). However, by 24 hpi, 305 annotated noncoding RNAs were found to be differentially expressed by the same criterion, with 73 changed by an average of 2-fold or greater (Fig. 4A). Several classes of noncoding RNAs were represented, including microRNA host genes, hypothetical genes and open reading frames (ORFs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and pseudogenes (Fig. 4A). DE pseudogenes often matched their protein-coding counterparts in directionality and degree of regulation, which suggests that regulatory regions were maintained and polyadenylated transcripts were produced (data not shown).\n\nWe also observed differential expression of four annotated microRNA host genes in infected cells, three of which were downregulated (MIR17HG, MIR142, and MIR621), while the remaining one was upregulated (MIR518F), all with 2-fold or greater changes. The downregulation of MIR17HG (by 2.25-fold) was of particular interest, as MIR17HG encodes a cluster of microRNAs, including miR-17, -18A, -19A, -19B, -20A, and -92 (Fig. 4B); in contrast, the other microRNA host genes encode only single microRNAs. Reads mapped to MIR17HG 3\u2032 of the mature microRNA sequences, indicating that the postexcised polyadenylated product may have been detected (Fig. 4B). We also observed a concurrent upregulation of known targets of MIR17HG-encoded microRNAs, including PCAF, a host factor required for Tat-induced HIV-1 gene expression (25). \n\nIn this study, we used NGS to measure all of the polyadenylated RNAs in CD4+ T lymphoblasts infected with intact, replication-competent HIV. NGS offers a number of potential benefits to the study of viral infections; among them is the ability to detect non-protein-coding RNAs expressed during infection. In a previous study, we used NGS to detect long noncoding RNAs in the lungs of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV)-infected mice (8). Many of these RNAs were found to be differentially expressed, and unique signatures of infection could be identified (8).\n\nIn this study, we also detected several noncoding RNA species in HIV-infected cells that were differentially expressed (DE). In most cases, the functions of these noncoding RNAs and their relevance to infection remains unknown. One noncoding RNA of interest, the microRNA host gene MIR17HG, encoded a cluster of microRNAs and was strongly downregulated during infection. While our method of RNA library preparation precluded direct detection of mature microRNAs, the NGS data set allowed the expression of both regulators and targets of microRNAs to also be observed. For example, we observed a concurrent upregulation of the known target host gene PCAF, a cellular factor required for HIV replication (25). In contrast to Triboulet et al. (25) who observed that PCAF was upregulated at the protein level but not the mRNA levels in infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we found that PCAF was upregulated at the mRNA level in infected SUP-T1 cells. This may indicate alternative modes of PCAF regulation in different cell types. In addition, MIR17HG-encoded microRNAs have hundreds of other candidate targets in the TargetScan database (26). Several of these candidates were found to be coexpressed with PCAF in our data set, including KLF3 (unpublished data). KLF3 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor whose precise function is unknown but whose sequence is located proximally to a single-nucleotide polymorphism strongly associated with HIV-1 plasma levels (27). We also observed differential expression of factors that may have mediated MIR17HG downregulation. For example, O\u2019Donnell et al. (28) found that c-Myc regulates expression of MIR17HG. Consistent with that study, we observed that MYC and MIR17HG were concordantly expressed, as MYC was downregulated at 12 and 24 hpi (Fig. 1). MYC suppression by HIV-1 may therefore underlie a number of subsequent of transcriptional events.\n\nWe also observed discordance between the large amount of viral RNA present (~20% of total mappable RNA) and the limited amount of altered host gene expression at 12 hpi (~1% of detectable gene loci). That is, despite the use of host machinery and the presence of foreign mRNA, host transcription remained relatively unchanged. This result suggests that at 12 hpi, viral transcription occurred on top of largely undisturbed transcription of host genes. The host genes that we detected as differentially expressed at 12 hpi showed that T cell activation and differentiation were suppressed in infected cells, likely via the downregulation of T cell activation-specific transcription factors (BCL11B, IRF1, IKZF1, and SOX4). The regulation of these and transcription factors specific for other functions (e.g., EGR1, KLF13, and MYC) may explain how HIV initiated replication with minimal disruption to host gene expression at 12 hpi but elicited larger-scale changes later in infection.\n\nThe suppression of T cell activation that we observed was consistent with previous studies on the response of T cells to infection by chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4)-tropic versus chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5)-tropic HIV-1 strains (29\u201331). For example, Sirois et al. (31) found that key T cell activation-related genes, including LCK, were downregulated at 24 hpi by a CXCR4-tropic strain, whereas these same genes were upregulated by a CCR5-tropic strain. Our study utilized the CXCR4-tropic strain LAI, and it would be interesting to generate NGS data for a CCR5-tropic virus for comparison. Interestingly, our observations of small-magnitude differences in expression were consistent with those of Sirois et al. (31), who found the expression of T cell activation-related genes to be changed by 0.5-fold or less using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR).\n\nBy 24 hpi, extensive reprogramming of the host transcriptome affecting a multitude of pathways had occurred. Remarkably, these large-scale changes occurred without concerted upregulation of innate immunity at the gene set level, suggesting that HIV-1 evaded viral sensing mechanisms. By this time point, the most affected pathways related to RNA fate determination, including RNA processing. While HIV-related RNA processing has been studied intensively, the contribution of most host factors remains incompletely defined (32). Modulation of this pathway by the virus may allow the proportion of unspliced, partially spliced, and fully spliced HIV RNA to be adjusted depending on the stage of the HIV life cycle. Our finding that over 150 genes related to RNA processing were differentially expressed suggests that HIV-1 infection results in a more complete modulation of RNA processing than previously identified (5, 33). However, our observed downregulation of RNA processing was consistent with results from an earlier study using NGS to investigate changes in CD4+ T lymphoblasts infected with an HIV-based, non-replication-competent vector at 24 hpi (34). Altered regulation of this and other pathways has been observed using microarrays as well, although in general, we observed changes in greater numbers of genes affecting these pathways using NGS (3, 5, 33, 35, 36).\n\nFinally, we compared our results from NGS to other types of data available regarding HIV-infected cells, including protein-protein interaction (PPI) data and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based screens. In an analysis of HIV-related PPI data, van Dijk et al. (37) identified sets of human proteins highly connected to host and viral proteins (37). Several proteins related to T cell activation were identified as highly connected; these proteins included CD4, CXCR4, and LCK (see Table S4 in the supplemental material). Downregulation of these members, as we observed, would therefore potentially affect the functions of many other proteins as well. Together, these data emphasize the high degree to which HIV-1 suppressed this pathway. In addition, many of the pathways associated with DE genes were identified as essential for HIV-1 replication in a recent meta-analysis of siRNA-based screen data (38). These pathways included DNA binding, RNA splicing, RNA export, nuclear transport, and protein complex assembly (Table S3). While the siRNA data suggest that HIV-1 initially requires these pathways to be active to establish an infection, our data suggest that HIV-1 also later suppresses and inactivates these pathways during active replication.\n\nIn conclusion, using NGS, we have reported a number of unique findings in HIV-infected cells: the direct measurement of viral and host RNA, the detection of small changes in the abundance of mRNA transcripts, the identification of novel viral RNA splice events, and the assay of multiple forms of noncoding RNAs, including insights into the regulation of microRNAs. These observations give additional insights into the panoply of changes that occur in host cells infected with HIV and provide the groundwork for using new sequencing technologies in future studies investigating the host response to viral infection.\n\nSUP-T1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1942) and propagated in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 \u00b5g/ml), and GlutaMAX-I. HIV-1 LAI strain (catalog no. 2522) was obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Germantown, MD) and propagated in SUP-T1 cells. U373-MAGI-CXCR4CEM cells were obtained from M. Emerman through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, and the virus titer in these cells was measured by the protocol of Deminie and Emerman (39). Typical titers reached 107 infectious units per ml. Infections were carried out at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 and performed in triplicate. Mock-infected samples received SUP-T1 cell conditioned medium and were also performed in triplicate. The infectious dose was optimized to achieve 100% infected cells at 24 hpi with ~50% cell viability as measured by trypan blue exclusion assay. Infected cells were visualized by immunofluorescence assay with rabbit HIV-1SF2 p24 antiserum kindly provided by BioMolecular Technologies through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from 5 \u00d7 106 cells per sample using a mirVana kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX), and the quality and concentration of the RNA were determined by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Samples were submitted for sequencing to IlluminaFastTrack Sequencing Services (Hayward, CA). cDNA libraries were generated using Illumina mRNA-SEQ kit. The quality and concentration of these libraries were determined by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The libraries were clonally amplified on a cluster generation station using Illumina version 4 cluster generation reagents to achieve a target density of approximately 300,000 (300K)/mm2 in a single channel of a flow cell. The resulting libraries were then sequenced on a Genome Analyzer IIx using Illumina version 4.0 sequencing reagents which generated single reads of 75 nucleotides (nt). Image analysis, base calling, and error estimation were performed using Illumina Analysis Pipeline (version 2.6).\n\nWe mapped the 75-nt reads to human ribosomal sequences using the short-read aligner software Bowtie to remove potential rRNA sequences (40). We then mapped the remaining unmapped reads to the HIV genome (GenBank accession no. K02013) using the gapped aligner software TopHat, which predicts HIV splicing junctions and maps intron-spanning reads to known splicing junctions (41). To quantify transcript expression, we mapped all reads that remained unmapped to the human reference genome (hg19, build GRCh37, downloaded from UCSC genome browser, http://genome.ucsc.edu) using the gapped aligner software TopHat. RefSeq transcript annotations were supplied to facilitate the mapping of reads spanning known splicing junctions. On the basis of these human genome mapping results, we then estimated the levels of expression at both the transcript and locus levels for RefSeq-annotated genes using the transcript assembly software Cufflinks (42). Read sequences that mapped to more than one genomic location were excluded from expression quantification. For visualization, BAM files were generated using TopHat and SAMtools (43) and displayed using the UCSC Genome Browser.\n\nThe positions of known viral splice sites were found in the literature (44), and the corresponding sequences were identified in strain pNL4-3 (GenBank accession no. AF003887). Based on sequence identity to strain LAI, a list of known LAI-specific splice sites was generated and compared to the NGS TopHat output. Splice patterns involving splice sites SD 1 and SA 2/2* were tested by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using primers PSK027F (5\u2032 CAGGGACTTGAAAGCGAAAG 3\u2032; locations 193 to 212 in HIVBRUCG accession no. K02013) and PSK027R (5\u2032 TGGGGCTTGTTCCATCTATC 3\u2032; locations 5136 to 5155).\n\nRNA was reverse transcribed using the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The resulting cDNA samples were diluted 50\u00d7. ABI TaqMan assays were run for each sample in triplicate (see Fig. S3C in the supplemental material). Relative expression was calculated using the \u2206\u2206CT method with averaged \u2206CT values (where CT stands for threshold cycle) for the OAZ1 gene as a calibrator, as the expression of OAZ1 did not significantly change between 12 and 24 hpi in the NGS data. Intracellular viral RNA load was quantified as previously described (45). Relative change of IRF1 was determined by qPCR using primers PSK1 (forward primer [5\u2032 TCTGGCTTTTTCCTCTGAGC 3\u2032] and reverse primer [5\u2032 ATGCTTTTCTGGGGTCACTG 3\u2032]).\n\nTo compare transcript expression across different conditions, we first normalized transcript abundances by the following methodology. Transcript abundance was quantified as FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped fragments) values estimated by Cufflinks. We chose one sample arbitrarily as a reference. Distributions of log2-transformed FPKM values between the reference and remaining samples were compared by quantile-quantile plots. We determined the scaling factor for each sample as the median difference of the corresponding quantile values of the sample and reference. Only genes/transcripts with raw FPKM values of \u22651 in all samples were considered in the estimation of scaling factors. We retained those genes/transcripts with nonzero FPKM values in 100% of the samples of at least one biological condition (our detection criterion). An offset of 1 was added to all normalized values to facilitate the comparisons involving one or more FPKM values of zero and to reduce the variability of the log ratios for low expression values. Transcripts were mapped to RefSeq gene loci, resulting in 9,992 loci with detectable reads. The data are available at http://www.viromics.washington.edu or upon request. The normalized expression data were analyzed for differential expression by using linear model methods as implemented in the R package limma (46). P values were derived from linear model-based t tests between infected and time-matched mock-infected samples. Unless otherwise noted, we defined differential expression by Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted P values of less than 0.05 based on the assumption that a false discovery rate of 5% provided an acceptable balance of false-positive control and statistical power. Fold changes (FC) were derived from comparing the means of these groups, and multiple groupings of fold changes were used (1.0 to 1.5 FC, 1.5 to 2.0 FC, and 2.0+ FC) based on previous observed fold change ranges observed in high-throughput and in particular NGS data in virus-infected systems (8).\n\nTo identify annotations among DE genes, we used the NIH DAVID resource (47, 48). Default settings were used in DAVID with GO_BP_FAT, GO_CC_FAT, GO_MP_FAT, BIOCARTA, and KEGG_PATHWAY gene set annotations. Complementary analysis was performed using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (11). Default settings were used in GSEA with Gene Ontology (GO) categories (c5.all.v2.5 gene sets) and Biocarta and KEGG pathways (c2.all.v2.5 gene sets) and 5,000 gene set-based permutations. Leading-edge analysis was performed within GSEA to derive genes for hierarchically clustering up- and downregulated gene sets.\n\nInteractions between DE genes were identified using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA). Networks were generated within IPA based on direct, literature-curated interactions. Subsets of genes were selected for input into IPA based on DE gene overlaps with DAVID annotation clusters. Heat maps were generated using the R package gplots. Comparisons to published networks of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data were made using Cytoscape (49)."}
