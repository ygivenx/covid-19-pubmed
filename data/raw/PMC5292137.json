{"title": "Development of Dual TaqMan Based One-Step rRT-PCR Assay Panel for Rapid and Accurate Diagnostic Test of MERS-CoV: A Novel Human Coronavirus, Ahead of Hajj Pilgrimage", "body": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses (1). They are widespread and can be found in many species of mice, horses, whales, birds, cats, dogs, pigs, and humans (1). Development of the infection, can lead to additional complications, including respiratory tract disease and organ dysfunction, particularly renal failure and immune suppression, enteric, neurologic or hepatic diseases (2, 3). The majority of patients have typical symptoms, such as fever with or without cough, and breathing difficulties (4). Middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a new and unknown origin respiratory virus with genotypic and phenotypic diversity; thus, this virus can mutate, increasing its virulence and even causing tissue tropism. There is a high-frequency mortality rate around > 50% and median age of the majority of identified cases affected with this virus is 56 years. Very little is known about its behavior (5, 6). Humans are known to maintain circulation of four different human coronaviruses (hCoVs) at a global population level. These are a part of the spectrum of agents that cause the common cold. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV constitutes the fifth hCoV, which was in circulation for a limited time during 2002 and 2003, when a virus appeared in humans and caused an outbreak affecting at least 8,000 people. Symptoms matched the clinical picture of acute primary viral pneumonia. MERS-CoV, a novel coronavirus, was detected for the first time in September of 2012 in Saudi Arabia, an area heavily impacted by this virus at present. Between April and June 2013, 81 cases of infection by this hCoV were reported in Saudi Arabia. Of those, 49 patients died, so fatality rate is high (2). This virus (MERS-CoV) causes severe acute respiratory infection in humans (7). Subsequently MERS-CoV has been reported in other countries, including Tunisia, United Arab, Emirates, Italy, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Qatar (2, 8-11). The first cases of MERS-CoV infections reported in Iran were two cases in Kerman, a city in southeast Iran. The virus killed one of them, a 53-year-old woman. With the appearance of new cases, in view of the risk of MERS-CoV transmission to humans (6), and because of severe infections that have been observed among the elderly, there is considerable concern about this virus (5). Although few cases have been reported annually (around 34 case as of 12 May 2013), the morbidity and mortality rate of this infection is alarming (7). Unfortunately, at present, there are no specific treatments or effective drugs for this deadly disease, and no vaccine. In the absence of an effective treatment, the appropriate infection controls include rapid diagnostics and isolation of patients, useful strategies for preventing further transmission and spread of this infectious agent (5). Currently, real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays are used for detection of MERS-CoV in respiratory, blood, and stool samples of patients. Real-time RT-PCR assay is highly sensitive and is able to detect viruses even in low copy numbers (12, 13).\n\nOur aims in this research were to present two rRT-PCR assays for in-house rapid and sensitive diagnostic testing of MERS-CoV, detecting the regions upstream of the envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame (ORF) 1b, respectively, for initial screening and final confirmation of MERS-CoV infection (according to world health organization (WHO) recommendations).\n\nIn this experimental study, the sequences, obtained from the National center for biotechnology information (NCBI; GenBank accession number: JX869059 for the Rotterdam virus isolate, termed hCoV-EMC), were synthesized (Eurofins Genomics, Germany) and served as templates for assay design. The DNA templates from upE and ORF1b of novel human coronavirus were amplified and confirmed using the corresponding real-time PCR specific probes and primers (forward and reverse) of each signature.\n\nTarget regions upE and ORF1b, synthesized by Eurofins Genomics (Germany) in the same vector (pGH cloning vector) were subcloned into the pSPT18 (Roche) expression vector using the HindIII restriction site (results not presented) and subsequently were transcribed into RNA for preparation of viral templates using the SP6/T7 Transcription kit (Roche) to synthesize both single-stranded RNAs. At all steps, contamination with RNase must be avoided through the usual diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treatments, the use of disposable plasticware, wearing gloves, etc. After DNase I digestion, both RNA transcripts were purified using Roche High Pure Viral RNA Kit and quantified by ultraviolet (UV) light spectroscopy. No DNA content remained at this stage due to its removal, and results of common real-time PCR assays were negative (results not presented), whereas the results of real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays were positive.\n\nThe novel in-house one-step rRT-PCR assay was developed using the QuantiFast RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) on Corbet (Rotor-Gene) 6000 (Qiagen, Germany) real-time PCR instrument. Each 25 \u00b5L reaction mixture contained 12.5 \u00b5L of 2 \u00d7 Master Mix, 1 \u00b5L of reverse transcriptase/Taq DNA polymerase mixture, 0.4 mM of each dNTP and 3.2 mM magnesium sulfate, 5 \u03bcL of RNA, 400 nM concentrations of upE forward primer (GCAACGCGCGATTCAGTT) and upE reverse primer (GCCTCTACACGGGACCCATA), and 200 nM of upE probe (6-carboxyfluorescein [FAM]-CTCTTCACATAATCGCCCCGAGCTCG-6-carboxy-N, N, N, N\u2019-tetramethylrhodamine [TAMRA]). Thermal cycling included 55\u00b0C for 20 minutes, followed by 95\u00b0C for 3 minutes and then 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 58\u00b0C for 30 seconds. It should be mentioned that common one-step real-time RT-PCR kits formulated for application with probes should all provide satisfactory results with default reaction mix compositions as suggested by their manufacturers.\n\nThis confirmatory assay had the same conditions as described above for the upE rRT-PCR, albeit the primer and probe sequences were different. This assay was performed with ORF1b forward primer (TTCGATGTTGAGGGTGCTCAT) and reverse primer (TCACACCAGTTGAAAATCCTAATTG), as well as its specific probe (6-carboxyfluorescein [FAM]-CCCGTAATGCATGTGGCACCAATGT-6-carboxy-N, N, N, N\u2019 tetramethylrhodamine [TAMRA]). This target gene did not overlap with those of known pan-CoV assays (2, 6, 7).\n\nAs noted above, two transcribed candidate signatures (target regions) upE and ORF1b, were used in both assays. Because of the difficulties in acquiring patient samples, according to WHO recommendation, these two RNA sequences were also synthesized (Eurofins Genomics, Germany) and used as RNA controls (standard RNAs) in optimization of the two assays and for preparation of serial dilutions for the evaluation of sensitivity. All RNA dilutions were prepared in RNase-free water.\n\nA) Limit of detection - MERS-CoV upE gene: serial dilutions of quantified standard upE RNAs (10, 100, 1000, 10000) were prepared in 10 mM TE buffer and tested by upE assay signature in 25 replicates. The highest dilution of upE RNAs at which all replicates were positive was defined as the limit of detection (LoD) for the upE assay.\n\nB) Limit of detection - MERS-CoV ORF1b gene: sensitivity evaluation was optimized by testing candidate probes and primers in the ORF1b signature assay with serial dilutions (5, 50, 500, 5000) of MERS-CoV quantified standard ORF1b RNAs in separate reactions and comparing them. Ten-fold serial dilutions of MERS-CoV ORF1b RNAs were prepared in buffer as above and tested in 25 replicates. The highest dilution of ORF1b RNAs at which all replicates were positive was defined as the limit of detection (LoD) for the ORF1b assay. A volume of 5 \u00b5L was used in two real-time RT-PCR assays of upE and ORF1b.\n\nReactivity with different MERS-CoV strains (in silico prediction): In addition to demonstrating reactivity of the rRT-PCR assay with the MERS-CoV strain Jordan-N3/NCV, primer/probe sequences were evaluated against an additional eight recently published genome sequences from seven patients collected from June 2012 to May 2013: GenBank accession numbers JX869059, KC776174, KC164505, KC667074, HPA Website (http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1317138176202), KF192507, KF186564-KF186567. Primer/probe sequences for all signatures were 100% identical to all published virus strains (results not presented).\n\nThe DNA templates synthesized from upE and ORF1b of novel human coronavirus were amplified and confirmed using 2% gel-based traditional PCR (Figure 1) and common real-time PCR with the corresponding specific probes and primers (forward and reverse) of each signature (Figures 2 and 3).\n\nThis confirmatory one-step rRT-PCR assay was performed for synthetic standard RNA containing upE signature using specific probe and primers (Figure 4). This test can initially screen for MERS-CoV infection bebecause it is a highly sensitive assay. The results of RNA transcripts (containing upE signature) were confirmatory, and were also similar to those of synthetic standard RNAs (results not presented here).\n\nThis confirmatory one-step rRT-PCR assay was performed for synthetic standard RNA containing ORF1b signature using specific probe and primers (Figure 5). This test can conclusively detect MERS-CoV infection bebecause it is a highly specific assay. The results of RNA transcripts (containing ORF1b signature) were confirmatory, and were also similar to those of synthetic standard RNAs (results not presented here).\n\nWe prepared serial dilutions of standard RNAs for evaluation of analytical sensitivity of assays (Figure 6). As shown in Tables 1 and 2, the stages of sensitivity (minimum detection limit) determination for each of these genes were done separately and the real-time RT-PCR assays showed different sensitivities for upE and ORF1b target regions.\n\nA) Limit of detection (LoD) of the MERS-CoV upE gene: The serial dilutions containing 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 copies of standard RNAs per reaction were analyzed using the real-time RT-PCR assay. The highest dilution of upE RNAs at which all replicates were positive was defined as the limit of detection (LoD) for the upE assay. The minimum detection limit of the assay signature was fewer than ten copies of standard RNAs per reaction (Table 1), as the higher dilutions were not evaluated.\n\nB) Limit of detection (LoD) of the MERS-CoV ORF1b gene: The serial dilutions containing 5, 50, 500, and 5000 copies of standard RNAs per reaction were analyzed using the real-time RT-PCR assay. The highest dilution of ORF1b RNAs at which all replicates were positive was defined as the limit of detection (LoD) for the ORF1b assay. The minimum detection limit of the assay signature was 50 or fewer copies of standard RNAs per reaction (Table 2), as the dilutions between 5 and 50 copies of standard RNAs per reaction were not evaluated.\n\nThis study showed that both the developed novel one-step rRT-PCR assays based on specific TaqMan probes are rapid, reliable, reproducible, specific, sensitive, and simple molecular methods for detection of MERS-CoV. Finally, the kit consisting of two assay signatures and controls was assembled, and it can be distributed to public health laboratories in Iran to support international MERS-CoV surveillance and public health response."}
