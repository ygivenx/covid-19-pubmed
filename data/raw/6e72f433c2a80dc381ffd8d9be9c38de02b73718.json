{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Sars-Cov-2: Underestimated damage to nervous system", "body": "Dear Editor, Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses, which generally induce enteric and respiratory diseases in animals and humans [1] . Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP, also called COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China [1] . This novel CoV(SARS-CoV-2) has caused a national outbreak of severe pneumonia in China, and rapidly spreads around the world. This indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can directly invade the nervous system of patients, instead of injuring the nervous system through the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. This is the first evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has directly invaded the nervous system.\n\nGenomic analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 is in the same Betacoronavirus clade as 2 MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and shares highly homological sequence with SARS-CoV [1] .\n\nThe public evidence shows that COVID-19 shares similar pathogenesis with the pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV [2] . Moreover, the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human host cells has been identified to use the same receptor as SARS-CoV [1] . Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV possess neuroinvasive properties, which can be detected in human brains. CoVs may enter the CNS through two distinct routes: hematogenous dissemination or neuronal retrograde dissemination. I think that the way of neuronal retrograde dissemination is more worrying.\n\nHCoV-OC43 RNA, a kind of human coronaviruses, could be detected for at least a year in the CNS of infected mice that survived the virus-induced acute encephalitis [3] . Therefore, an apparently innocuous human respiratory pathogen may persist in the human CNS as a component of the brain, like herpes simplex virus (HSV) in a large proportion of the population. If SARS-CoV-2 exists for a long time, like HSV, and it will recur again in predisposed individuals.\n\nIn addition, the presence of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 was detected in various neurological diseases in humans, including multiple sclerosis (MS) [4] . Multiple sclerosis truly represents a human neurological disease where an infectious agent or agents may play a triggering role, with viruses the most likely culprit in genetically predisposed individuals [5] .If the SARS-CoV-2 is latent in CNS for a long time, will the cured patients reappear with neurological diseases because of the latentness of the SARS-CoV-2, which is a doubt for the late neurological complications of the cured patients. If the SARS-CoV-2 is latent in the nervous system for a long period of time, will the cured patients reappear with neurological"}
