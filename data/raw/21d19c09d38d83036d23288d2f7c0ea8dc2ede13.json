This study was conducted to determine if a rate enhancement hybridization (REH) buffer, developed for membrane hybridization, could be used to decrease hybridization time for ISH. Tissue from swine with an enteric disease produced by a swine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was used as a model to standardize hybridization conditions for a rapid ISH technique. Small intestinal sections from pigs experimentally and naturally infected with TGEV were hybridized for various times at 52\u00b0C and 70\u00b0C with a radiolabelled or a fluorescein-labelled RNA probe in a standard hybridization or a REH buffer. Viral RNA was detected in intestines from as early as 30 min of hybridization by using both buffers with the radiolabelled probe; however, the signal was stronger with the REH buffer. With the fluorescein-labelled probe, viral RNA was detected in virus-infected cells of the intestines after 30 min of hybridization by using the REH buffer. Signal intensity was greater with the REH buffer than with the standard hybridization buffer when compared at each hybridization time and hybridization temperature using both radiolabelled and fluorescein-labelled probes. With the REH buffer, hybridization signal intensity was greater at 70\u00b0C than at 52\u00b0C for both probes. The best results were obtained when small intestinal sections were hybridized at 70\u00b0C for 2 h using a radiolabelled or a fluorescein-labelled probe diluted in the REH buffer. The fluorescein-labelled RNA probe with REH buffer resulted in a minimal non-specific signal when compared with the radiolabelled probe. These studies demonstrated that the REH buffer can be used to decrease the time of ISH for the detection of viral RNA. This rapid ISH technique should have broad applications in the utilization of probe technology in diagnostics and research for the detection of target ribonucleic acids in situ.\u00a9 1997 Academic Press Limited\n\nIn situ hybridization (ISH) is widely used for the or oligonucleotides. A major disadvantage of ISH is that it is a time-consuming technique, taking about 2 detection of DNA and RNA in intact eukaryotic and procaryotic cells by using radiolabelled or non-radio-days for non-isotopic ISH and 4 days or more for isotopic ISH. One of the rate limiting steps is hy-labelled probes. Probes for ISH may be DNA, RNA bridization which requires at least 16 h. 1-6 There have ends of the jejunum and the ileum were collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. A segment been two reports describing a reduction of hybridization time to 3 h using DNA probes 7 and to 2 h of the small intestine from the five pigs naturally infected with TGEV and the two TGEV negative pigs using ribotypes. 8 Recently, rate enhancement hybridization (REH) buffers have become commercially was placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The tissues were processed and embedded in paraffin. available. These buffers can decrease hybridization time for membrane-based procedures such as South-Consecutive sections were cut from each tissue, placed on nuclease-free silylated slides (PGC sci-ern, northern, and dot blot hybridizations.\n\nFor the development of rapid ISH, tissues from entific), deparaffinized and hydrated as previously reported. 18 swine with experimentally induced, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), were used as a model. TGE is characterized by vomiting, severe diarrhoea, and high mortality in piglets during the first few weeks of life.\n\nPreparation of probes The causative agent of TGE is a coronavirus referred to as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Co-RNA probes were prepared from plasmid pPSP.FP 1 containing the left half of the S gene of TGEV cloned ronavirus particles are pleomorphic and enveloped and contain a single-stranded positive-sense RNA in a phagemid vector. 19 The plasmid pPSP.FP 1 contains nucleotides 1678 to 2250 20 of the S gene of TGEV, genome. 9 TGEV replicates in the cytoplasm of the mature absorptive enterocytes 9-14 and causes villous and was linearized with the restriction enzyme BamHI (Promega). The in vitro transcription and labelling of atrophy. Here we describe a rapid ISH technique, using REH buffer, that allows decreased hybridization the probe was performed as described previously 18 by using T7 RNA polymerase, the four NTPs (ATP, time for both radiolabelled and fluorescein-labelled probes.\n\nCTP labelled RNA probe was labelled by using a RNA colour kit (Amersham) and purified by using a Se-erence virus.

The intensity of the hybridization signal increased with time as the two buffers hybridization signal with the REH buffer at 70\u00b0C was less intense at 2 h compared to 20 h. However, the To further determine the effect of the temperature and background was also higher after 20 h hybridization the buffers, hybridization was performed using the than after 2 h hybridization. Viral RNA could be standard hybridization and REH buffer each at two detected with the REH buffer at 70\u00b0C as early as different temperatures of 52\u00b0C and 70\u00b0C for 0.5, 1, 30 min. 2 and 20 h of hybridization. Hybridization with the standard hybridization buffer was best at 52\u00b0C, whereas for the REH buffer, the optimal hybridization temperature giving the best signal was 70\u00b0C (Fig. 1a Microscopic examination of intestinal sections & b). The hybridization signal at 70\u00b0C with the REH hybridized with 35 S-labelled RNA probe buffer after 2 h hybridization was equivalent to or better than that detected after 20 h of hybridization at Sections obtained from infected pigs and coated with 52\u00b0C with the standard hybridization buffer. Sections emulsion gel had heavy concentrations of silver grains hybridized with the REH buffer for 2 h at 70\u00b0C also along the mucosal layer. In contrast, sections from gave the best signal-to-noise ratio and the most intense uninoculated control animals were negative for silver signal when compared with the standard hygrains. The silver grains were primarily concentrated over the cytoplasm of the villous enterocytes (Fig. 3) , bridization buffer at both 52\u00b0C and 70\u00b0C, and the . Sections in panels A and B were hybridized using standard hybridization buffer at 52\u00b0C and those in panel C were hybridized using standard hybridization buffer at 70\u00b0C. Sections in panels D and F were hybridized using the REH buffer at 70\u00b0C and those in panel E were hybridized using REH buffer at 52\u00b0C. The results showed the hybridization signal as dark continuous lines along the mucosal surface of the TGEV-inoculated small intestinal sections. Such a hybridization signal was not detected in small intestines from uninoculated pigs. Best results were obtained with REH buffer after 2 h hybridization at 70\u00b0C. and some were present in crypt epithelial cells. Signal nucleus. Sections hybridized with the REH buffer at 70\u00b0C clearly had a higher signal intensity and a greater intensity was similar to the autoradiographic results captured on X-ray films. Sections that were hybridized number of viral infected cells than sections hybridized with standard hybridization buffer at 52\u00b0C, at each with the REH buffer at 70\u00b0C for 2 h had higher concentration of silver grains than those hybridized hybridization time (Table 1 ). Viral infected cells were detected after 2 h of hybridization using standard with the standard hybridization buffer at 52\u00b0C for 20 h (Fig. 3a and b) . Sections that hybridized with hybridization buffer at 52\u00b0C. In contrast, viral infected cells were detected after 30 min of hybridization the REH buffer had higher non-specific silver grains than standard hybridization buffer, which increased with the REH buffer at 70\u00b0C. This treatment gave an equivalent or more intense signal, and a greater with time. The histopathologic changes observed in the small intestines from the infected animals were number of viral infected cells than secretions hybridized with standard hybridization buffer at 52\u00b0C villous atrophy, blunted and denuded villi, and replacement of the columnar epithelial cells by flat to for 2 h. Sections hybridized with the REH buffer at 70\u00b0C for 20 h had the highest signal intensity, and cuboidal cells.\n\nthe greatest number of viral infected cells. There was only a slight increase in signal intensity after 20 h hybridization with REH buffer at 70\u00b0C without an In situ hybridization on sections of TGEVinfected tissues using a fluorescein-labelled increase in the number of virus infected cells over those hybridized for 2 h. The signal intensity and the RNA probe number of virus infected cells on sections hybridized with the REH buffer at 70\u00b0C for 2 h was equal to or Once the hybridization conditions were standardized with the radiolabelled probe, we compared the effect higher than that with sections hybridized with standard hybridization buffer at 52\u00b0C for 20 h (Fig. 4 a & of standard hybridization buffer at 52\u00b0C with the REH buffer at 70\u00b0C by using a fluorescein-labelled RNA b). The signal intensity and the number of viral nucleic acid positive cells were less after 1 h and 30 min probe. Viral nucleic acid was detected in enterocytes of the small intestinal sections hybridized with either compared to 2 h hybridization. The intensity of the signals varied from purple after 30 min, to dark purple buffer, mainly in villous epithelial cells (Fig. 4) and some crypt epithelial cells. Dark purple colour was after 1 h and to very dark purple after both 2 h and 20 h hybridization. Sections hybridized with the REH detected in the cytoplasm without any staining of the signal with increased hybridization time, but this buffer containing the fluorescein-labelled RNA probe did not give a higher non-specific signal compared increase in non-specific signal was not a problem with 2 h hybridization and was not detected with to the standard hybridization buffer.\n\nnon-isotopic ISH. Sections hybridized with the REH buffer containing a fluorescein-labelled RNA probe at 70\u00b0C detected viral infected cells as early as 30 min DISCUSSION of hybridization whereas use of the standard hybridization buffer at 52\u00b0C only detected viral infected In this study, we have described a rapid ISH technique for the detection of nucleic acids in formalin-fixed cells after 2 h or more of hybridization. The intensity of the signal with both types of probes decreased paraffin-embedded tissues. Hybridization of either radiolabelled and fluorescein-labelled probes with with shorter hybridization time of 1 h and 30 min, but the signal was still visible. Signal intensity and the REH buffer decreased hybridization time from 20 to 2 h without compromising the intensity or the hybridization time in ISH are probably impacted by the copy number of the target nucleic acids which quality of the hybridization signal. Optimal results with strong signal and signal-to-noise ratio were ob-require at least 10 copies in a cell. 22 It may be possible to decrease hybridization time to 1 h or even 30 min, tained with both radiolabelled and fluoresceinlabelled probes by using the REH buffer at 70\u00b0C for with a higher copy number of target nucleic acid. Morphology of the cells was not impacted with either 2 h. One minor disadvantage of using the REH buffer for isotopic ISH was the slight increase in non-specific hybridization conditions is not known whether this methodology will work for the detection of DNA or with DNA probes as the incubation of samples at 90\u00b0C in a hot air oven for 15 min before hybridization with a RNA probe of 600 bond between RNA and RNA is stronger than that between DNA and DNA or DNA and RNA.
