{"title": "PPAR\u03b3 signaling and metabolism: the good, the bad and the future NIH Public Access Author Manuscript", "body": "Despite their many similarities, each PPAR isoform has unique functions in vivo, probably because of distinct tissue distributions, differential responses to distinct ligands and inherent differences in biochemical properties 1, 3 . PPAR\u03b1, the first PPAR to be identified, is expressed predominantly in the liver, heart and brown adipose tissue (BAT), where it is a major activator of fatty acid oxidation pathways and is the target of the hypolipidemic fibrate drugs 1, 3 . Although PPAR\u03b4 (also called PPAR\u03b2 and commonly referred to as PPAR\u03b4/ \u03b2) shares similar functions with PPAR\u03b1, it is ubiquitously expressed and has a crucial role in fatty acid oxidation in key metabolic tissues such as skeletal muscle, liver and heart 2,3 . PPAR\u03b3 is most highly expressed in white adipose tissue (WAT) and BAT, where it is a master regulator of adipogenesis as well as a potent modulator of whole-body lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity 1, 7 . Because of alternative splicing and differential promoter usage, PPAR\u03b3 exists as two isoforms, PPAR\u03b31 and PPAR\u03b32, with the latter containing an additional 30 amino acids at its N terminus 7, 8 . Whereas PPAR\u03b31 is expressed in many tissues, the expression of PPAR\u03b32 is restricted to adipose tissue under physiological conditions but can be induced in other tissues by a high-fat diet (HFD) 8, 9 . Although all three PPARs are strongly implicated in the metabolic syndrome 10 , the aim of this review is to focus on PPAR\u03b3 and highlight recent findings that have shed light onto this signaling pathway and renewed interest in its therapeutic potential for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\n\nEven though fatty acids and their derivatives can bind and activate PPAR\u03b3, the identification of specific endogenous PPAR\u03b3 ligands has been difficult, and thus specific modes of action related to fatty acids and their metabolites have not been clearly defined 4, 6 . In contrast, synthetic ligands, such as TZDs, are potent activators of PPAR\u03b3 with robust insulinsensitizing activities 11 . Consequences of highly effective oral medications used in the treatment of difficult-to-manage type 2 diabetes that chronically activate PPAR\u03b3 include weight gain, fluid retention and osteoporosis 11 . Meta-analyses of clinical trials have implicated the TZD rosiglitazone (Avandia) in increasing the risk of congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality 12, 13 , leading to tightly restricted access in the United States and a recommendation for market withdrawal in Europe 14 and several other jurisdictions. Pioglitazone (Actos), another TZD, does not seem to impart the same cardiovascular risks that rosiglitazone does. Indeed, a large placebocontrolled clinical trial indicated a modest reduction in major cardiovascular events in people with high-risk diabetes receiving pioglitazone over a 3-year period 15 . However, safety concerns have also been raised about pioglitazone in relation to congestive heart failure 16 and bladder cancer 17, 18 , the latter leading to safety warnings and drug withdrawal in parts of Europe 12 .\n\nAccordingly, further understanding of how different TZDs trigger specific side effects, as well as the alternative routes of PPAR\u03b3 activation, will potentially lead to new and improved therapies for type 2 diabetes. Recently, in part because of powerful new technologies (Box 1), much progress has been made in understanding the signaling, regulation and tissuespecific roles of PPAR\u03b3 [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Many of these advances reveal new insights into the mechanisms underlying PPAR\u03b3-mediated insulin sensitization as well as its associated side effects, providing opportunities to develop newer classes of molecules that reduce or eliminate the adverse effects associated with TZDs.\n\nApplying genome-wide analyses to study regulation of PPAR\u03b3 signaling Recent advances in high-throughput technologies, such as next-generation sequencing methods, have allowed the investigation of genome-wide transcriptional regulation in an unbiased manner to provide abundant information regarding gene expression, cis-acting elements, trans-acting factors, epigenetic status and chromatin structure 137 . Such genomic studies of PPAR\u03b3 have revealed the comprehensive binding-site distribution of PPAR\u03b3 in adipocytes and macrophages, the colocalization frequency of PPAR\u03b3 with other transcription factors, such as RXR-\u03b1, C/EBPs and PU.1, comparative histone modification profiling in adipocytes and macrophages and chromatin architecture changes during adipogenesis 72, [138] [139] [140] [141] . Notably, analysis of data obtained using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) in the context of human adipocytes shows that PPAR\u03b3 binding sites are rarely in the promoter regions of genes, accounting for just 3% of genome-wide sites, with introns (45%) and intergenic enhancers (48%) comprising the majority of binding sites 142 . Interestingly, although promoter-localized PPAR\u03b3 binding sites are rare, these genes are robustly TZD responsive 142, 143 . Additionally, DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing (DNase-seq) revealed that 33% of PPAR\u03b3 target sites are present in an 'accessible' or open chromatin structure before DNA binding during adipogenesis, indicating a frequent (though not mandatory) cooperative action of PPAR\u03b3 with early adipogenic transcription factors such as C/EBPs. Adding another layer of transcriptional control, cytosine hydroxymethylation, also participates in PPAR\u03b3 enhancer function during adipogenesis 144 .\n\nCollectively we know that PPAR\u03b3 response networks are extremely complex and distinctly regulated in a cell type-specific manner. However, many questions remain to be answered to develop a more comprehensive understanding about PPAR\u03b3 signaling. What are the co-regulators involved in determining cell-type specificity? How do changes in the epigenome and chromatin structure affect transcriptional outcomes? How do distal regulatory elements such as enhancers control the activity of promoters?\n\nAlthough individual genomic approaches can provide highly informative and specific answers, a combination of high-throughput sequencing applications and data integration is necessary to comprehensively understand transcriptional events in an unbiased, genome-wide manner during complex biological processes. As a transcription factor, regulation of PPAR\u03b3 signaling must be understood by its specific pattern of association with target DNA and, through this process, positive or negative regulation of proximal promoters. In addition, from a dynamic point of view, recruitment of tissue specific coactivators and co-repressors will need to be established to more fully understand the dynamics of chromatin modification and gene control.\n\nPPAR\u03b3 was originally described as a factor induced during adipocyte differentiation 7, 24, 25 and is best known for its role in regulating adipogenic and lipogenic pathways (Fig. 1) . Generation of the PPAR\u03b3-null mouse, which is completely devoid of adipose tissue, firmly established PPAR\u03b3 as a master regulator of adipocyte differentiation 26 . Recently a dynamic adipocyte progenitor population was identified within the WAT perivascular niche whose expression of PPAR\u03b3 suggests it may play a part in adipocyte self renewal 27, 28 . PPAR\u03b3 is also required for mature adipocyte function, as revealed by the finding that adipocytes only survive for a few days after selective ablation of PPAR\u03b3 in mature adipocytes of mice 29, 30 .\n\nIn addition to its role in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism, PPAR\u03b3 is also crucial for controlling gene networks involved in glucose homeostasis, including increasing the expression of glucose transporter type 4 (Glut4) and c-Cbl-associated protein (CAP). Moreover, PPAR\u03b3 controls the expression of numerous factors secreted from adipose tissue, such as adiponectin, resistin, leptin and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), which also influence insulin sensitivity [31] [32] [33] [34] . Considering that these factors probably act through distinct signaling pathways and different, although overlapping, tissue targets, several different mechanisms may be involved in achieving the insulin-sensitizing effect. For example, some factors might act on inflammation (TNF-\u03b1), hepatic glucose output (adiponectin) or feeding behavior (leptin). Physiologically, these pathways may complement each other, and although pharmacologic increase of one of the pathways could be sufficient to achieve a therapeutic benefit, none of these factors has moved into advanced human trials. However, they clearly illustrate the promise for multiple (and potentially safe) routes for therapeutic intervention.\n\nConsistent with its central role in adipogenesis and insulin sensitization, humans with dominant-negative mutations in a single allele of PPARG have partial lipodystrophy and insulin resistance [35] [36] [37] . The discovery that TZDs, which have known potent adipogenic and anti-diabetic effects, are agonists for PPAR\u03b3 solidified the importance of PPAR\u03b3 in insulin sensitization and prompted numerous and extensive studies on this nuclear receptor 4, 7, 38 . Thus, despite its many caveats, directly targeting PPAR\u03b3 itself remains the 'gold standard' for treating metabolic disease.\n\nThe ability of PPAR\u03b3 to control the expression of adipose-secreted factors, such as adiponectin, led to a search for additional regulatory factors 39 (Fig. 1 ). This resulted in the identification of two PPAR\u03b3-responsive members of the fibroblast growth factor family (FGF1 and FGF21), which act locally in adipose tissue to promote insulin sensitization in response to HFD 22, 23, 39 . FGF21 was originally found to be induced in the liver by PPAR\u03b1 in response to fasting to regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. It was subsequently revealed that FGF21 is induced in WAT by both HFD and PPAR\u03b3 agonists 40 . Unexpectedly, whereas hepatic FGF21 circulates as a hormone, adipose FGF21 does not circulate and instead acts in an autocrine fashion to locally transduce PPAR\u03b3 signaling to enhance adipogenesis 23 . As they are unable to store fat, FGF21-knockout mice have reduced adiposity with decreased expression of PPAR\u03b3 target genes in WAT 23 . Moreover, these mice are resistant to the insulin-sensitizing effects of TZDs as well as the associated weight gain and fluid retention, implicating FGF21 as an important mediator of the antidiabetic actions and negative side effects of TZDs. Notably, FGF21 knockout mice have increased sumoylation of PPAR\u03b3 (discussed in more detail below), which reduces its transcriptional activity 23 . Taken together these findings reveal that during the fed state, PPAR\u03b3 induces FGF21, which works locally in adipose tissue to amplify PPAR\u03b3 activity and promote insulin sensitization.\n\nRecently it was found that FGF1, the prototype of the FGF family of proteins, is also regulated by PPAR\u03b3 and highly induced in visceral adipose tissue in response to HFD or treatment with TZDs 22 . Of three alternative gene promoters, only the FGF1A isoform shows diet or TZD inducibility 22 . Although FGF1 has been implicated in a diverse range of physiological processes, FGF1 knockout mice show no phenotype under standard laboratory conditions, which led to the long-held assumption that FGF1 was dispensable 41 . Strikingly, however, when placed on a HFD, FGF1 knockout mice develop a crippling, disabling 'fat fibrosis' that structurally restricts adipose expansion, resulting in an aggressive diabetic phenotype 22 . Moreover, after HFD withdrawal, the adipose tissue of these mice cannot properly contract, leading to marked fat necrosis and structural fragmentation of the fat pad. Collectively, these concurrent and severe pathologies indicate a key role for a PPAR\u03b3-FGF1 signaling axis in adaptive adipose remodeling to maintain metabolic homeostasis during cycles of feast and famine.\n\nBy working in an autocrine manner, a paracrine manner or both, FGF21 and FGF1 act locally in adipose tissue to mediate the physiological and pharmacological actions of PPAR\u03b3. Further studies are needed to elucidate the relative roles of these two FGFs and their regulation by PPAR\u03b3. Nevertheless, these newly identified PPAR\u03b3 signaling pathways identify FGFs as important new mediators of the beneficial effects of TZDs and represent a paradigm shift in which signals such as HFD or drugs act on sensors such as PPAR\u03b3 that in turn direct the production of locally acting factors (FGFs) to control energy homeostasis ( Fig. 1 ). In the case of FGF21, pharmacological administration of this protein in mice results in marked bone loss, potentially limiting its use therapeutically 42 . A clear understanding of the two FGF signaling pathways, as well as other components of the PPAR\u03b3 signaling cascade, will be crucial for dissociating the specific mechanisms responsible for improved insulin sensitization from those involved in causing the adverse side effects associated with TZDs.\n\nAdipose tissue is where PPAR\u03b3 is most highly expressed and is the tissue with the most notable gene expression changes in response to treatment with PPAR\u03b3 agonists 43 . Therefore, the insulin-sensitizing effects, as well as certain negative side effects, of TZDs are generally attributed to adipose-specific PPAR\u03b3 activation. In adipose tissue, PPAR\u03b3 upregulates genes involved in glucose uptake and also controls the expression of adipocyte-secreted factors, such as adiponectin, that communicate with other organs to affect whole-body insulin sensitivity 1 . Furthermore, as high concentrations of circulating fatty acids are positively correlated with insulin resistance, enhanced uptake and sequestration of fatty acids in adipose tissue by PPAR\u03b3 activation are thought to ameliorate insulin resistance 44 . It has been postulated that the increased uptake of fatty acids and enhanced adipogenic capacity in WAT, elicited by PPAR\u03b3 activation, are also responsible for TZD-associated weight gain. However, selective activation of PPAR\u03b3 in adipocytes of mice is sufficient to cause wholebody insulin sensitization without an increase in weight. This finding raises the possibility that adipose tissue might be sufficient for the insulin-sensitizing effects of TZDs but not the side effects such as weight gain 45 . Conversely, the facts that PPAR\u03b3 is expressed, albeit at lower levels, in a variety of nonadipose tissues and that TZDs improve insulin sensitivity in lipodystrophic (fatless) mice suggest that other tissues may also be direct targets and contribute to the insulin-sensitizing effects of TZDs, as well as the unwanted side effects 46, 47 .\n\nExperiments with tissue-specific knockouts of PPAR\u03b3 have been crucial in helping dissect the relative contributions of PPAR\u03b3 activity to insulin sensitization in different tissues. Mice with adipose-specific ablation of PPAR\u03b3 show insulin resistance in adipose tissue and liver but not skeletal muscle 30 . In these mice, TZDs improved insulin sensitivity in the skeletal muscle and liver but not adipose tissue, indicating a direct action of TZDs in skeletal muscle and liver as well as adipose tissue 30 . In this regard, two groups independently examined mice with targeted ablation of PPAR\u03b3 in skeletal muscle 48, 49 . In one study with older mice, a lack of skeletal-muscle PPAR\u03b3 resulted in severe insulin resistance, and the skeletal muscles of these mice were unresponsive to TZD treatment, indicating a role for skeletalmuscle PPAR\u03b3 in the action of TZD 48 . In a second study, younger mice with targeted muscle PPAR\u03b3 deficiency did not develop skeletal-muscle insulin resistance and remained responsive to TZD treatment 49 . Interestingly, these mice developed excess adiposity and hepatic insulin resistance, suggesting that the insulin-sensitizing effects of TZDs on muscle are indirect and age dependent and that skeletal-muscle PPAR\u03b3 may have a role in the regulation of whole-body insulin sensitivity, perhaps through tissue crosstalk 49 . Although further investigation will help resolve the apparent age-dependent differences, it is clear that skeletal muscle plays a part in TZD-induced insulin sensitization. The liver is also a proposed site of TZD action; however, the effects of PPAR\u03b3 agonism on the liver remain under debate, with some studies showing that it promotes hepatic steatosis through upregulation of genes involved in lipid uptake and storage 43 and others showing that it prevents hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, possibility by sequestering fatty acids in adipose tissue and preventing hepatic stellate cell activation [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . Treatment with PPAR\u03b3 agonists also decreases the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, and liver-specific disruption of PPAR\u03b3 in mice results in increased adiposity, hyperlipidemia and insulin resistance, yet these mice remain responsive to TZD treatment 55 . However, on a lipodystrophic background, liver-specific ablation of PPAR\u03b3 renders these mice resistant to TZD treatment, indicating that in the absence of adipose tissue, the liver becomes a major site of TZD action 55 . PPAR\u03b3 is also expressed in pancreatic beta cells, where it induces the expression of key genes involved in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), and TZDs have been shown to enhance GSIS in insulin-resistant rodents and humans [56] [57] [58] [59] . However, results from in vivo studies have been conflicting, with one study showing alterations in beta-cell mass but no change in glucose homeostasis in mice lacking PPAR\u03b3 in their beta cells and a more recent study showing that loss of PPAR\u03b3 in the whole pancreas results in hyperglycemia with impaired GSIS 60, 61 . Further investigation will be required to determine the precise role of PPAR\u03b3 in pancreatic beta cells and its contribution to mediating the insulin-sensitizing effects of TZDs. Taken together, these studies reveal that TZDs act through several key metabolic organs to exert their insulin-sensitizing effects.\n\nPPAR\u03b3 also has an important role in various immune cells, with most studies focusing on its role in antigen-presenting myeloid dendritic cells and macrophages [62] [63] [64] [65] . In dendritic cells, PPAR\u03b3 regulates lipid metabolism and transport as well as various processes, including antigen uptake, maturation, activation, migration, cytokine production and antigen presentation 62, 63 . Macrophage PPAR\u03b3 is implicated in anti-inflammation and lipid metabolism 54,66-69 , and mice lacking macrophage PPAR\u03b3 are more prone to whole-body insulin resistance 70, 71 . Furthermore, these mice have impaired maturation of antiinflammatory 'M2' macrophages 71 . Reciprocally, the inflammatory gene network in wildtype proinflammatory 'M1' macrophages is potently inhibited by TZD treatment. In this regard, differential localization of PPAR\u03b3, distinct sets of co-regulators and specific epigenetic modifications collectively influence cell-and tissue-specific PPAR\u03b3 functions 72 . Emerging technological advances provide new methods for identifying epigenomic processes and interrogating PPAR\u03b3 in different tissues and cell types on a genome-wide scale that will help uncover the tissue-specific functions of PPAR\u03b3 (Box 1). Notably, although anti-inflammatory CD4 + tissue-resident regulatory T (T reg ) cells are widely distributed throughout the body, those in visceral adipose tissue uniquely express high levels of PPAR\u03b3. In contrast, T reg cells in other adipose depots are not PPAR\u03b3 positive 73 . The relative numbers of T reg cells are markedly reduced in obese and insulin-resistant states. Furthermore, T reg cell-specific knockout of PPAR\u03b3 reduces responsiveness to insulin sensitizers 73 . PPAR\u03b3 also exerts an anti-inflammatory role in the artery wall, as revealed by studies in low-density lipoprotein receptor-null mice 74 . Much more work needs to be done to explore the role of PPAR\u03b3 in T reg cells, macrophages and other types of immune cells to better elucidate the molecular connection between PPAR\u03b3, inflammation and lipid metabolism.\n\nIn addition to the insulin-sensitizing benefits of TZDs, it is important to identify the tissues that contribute to their side effects, such as weight gain, fluid retention, bone loss and heart problems. Although TZD-induced weight gain has been attributed to PPAR\u03b3 activation in adipose tissue, studies in mice and humans have suggested a central role for PPAR\u03b3 in whole-body energy homeostasis 45, [75] [76] [77] . Although PPAR\u03b3 is known to have a neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory role in the central nervous system (CNS) 78 , two recent and independent reports indicated that activation of PPAR\u03b3 in the brain, rather than in adipose tissue, contributes to TZD-induced weight gain 20, 21 . Using combinations of pharmacological and genetic approaches in HFD-fed rodents, these studies showed that by controlling food intake and energy expenditure, the action of PPAR\u03b3 in the CNS is required for the increased weight gain associated with TZDs 20, 21 . Although both studies suggest that increased leptin sensitivity may mediate these metabolic effects, additional work will be required to define the specific neural targets and clarify the balance between central and peripheral PPAR\u03b3 signaling in insulin sensitization. Nevertheless, these two studies strongly suggest that PPAR\u03b3 action in the CNS contributes to TZD-induced weight gain, leading to the question of what the properties of non-brain penetrant TZDs are.\n\nAlthough TZDs were shown to improve the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy 79 , fluid retention with associated edema remains a substantial side effect of TZDs 11 , and strategies designed to eliminate this aspect of PPAR\u03b3 signaling would be extremely beneficial. Recent studies have revealed that TZDs contribute to this fluid retention and peripheral edema by altered sodium and water reabsorption in the distal collecting ducts of the kidney 80, 81 .\n\nHowever, the precise mechanism by which TZDs exert this action remains under debate, as there have been divergent findings concerning the role of the epithelial sodium channel in this phenomenon 82, 83 . Besides an impact on weight gain, reduced fluid retention may also lower the risk for adverse cardiovascular events, such as congestive heart failure. Although it is expressed at low levels in the heart, the expression of PPAR\u03b3 is increased in the hearts of humans with metabolic syndrome 84 . Studies of PPAR\u03b3 in the cardiomyocytes of mice have not resulted in a consensus. Mice with cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of PPAR\u03b3 show cardiac hypertrophy, whereas mice overexpressing PPAR\u03b3 in cardiomyocytes develop dilated cardiomyopathy with increased lipid and glycogen stores and disrupted mitochondria 85, 86 . Although fluid retention may be the major contributor to the negative impact of TZDs on the heart, further studies are needed to clarify the role of PPAR\u03b3 in this organ.\n\nAnother reported side effect of TZDs is a higher rate of fractures in human patients 11 . Consistent with this, TZDs cause bone loss in mice and rats by simultaneously decreasing bone formation (osteoblastogenesis) and increasing bone resorption (osteoclastogenesis) 87 . PPAR\u03b3 has been shown to inhibit osteoblast differentiation and bone formation 88 . PPAR\u03b3null embryonic stem cells do not differentiate into adipocytes and instead spontaneously differentiate into osteoblasts, whereas TZDs inhibit osteoblast differentiation and promote adipogenesis 87, 88 . PPAR\u03b3 promotes osteoclast differentiation, and deletion of PPAR\u03b3 in mouse hematopoietic lineages results in osteoclast deficiency and resistance to TZDstimulated bone resorption 89 . These findings indicate that TZD-induced bone loss is the result of bone cell-autonomous PPAR\u03b3 action, which simultaneously inhibits osteoblastogenesis while enhancing osteoclastogenesis. Together these studies reveal that TZDs act on a variety of tissues to confer insulin sensitization as well as cause deleterious side effects (Fig. 2) . These important findings open up new avenues of research to help direct the development of tissue-specific compounds that improve the differential between beneficial and adverse events.\n\nPPAR\u03b3 is also regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, sumoylation and ubiquitination, each of which represents a potentially distinct feature that could be exploited for cell-or tissue-specific modulation of this molecule 90,91 (Fig. 3) . PPAR\u03b3 is phosphorylated within the AF1 region by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (PPAR\u03b32 at Ser112 and PPAR\u03b31 at Ser82), which represses its transcriptional activity by inhibiting ligand binding and altering cofactor recruitment [92] [93] [94] . Notably, phosphorylation of the same site by the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk7 and Cdk9 increases PPAR\u03b3 activity 95, 96 . Therefore, the phosphorylation of PPAR\u03b3 at Ser112 can result in different transcriptional outcomes depending on the physiological context and the kinases involved. In vivo studies of this phosphorylation site have been discrepant, indicating that further investigation will be required to elucidate the function of this site and determine the relative roles of these two kinases in regulating PPAR\u03b3 activity 75, 97, 98 .\n\nRecently it was found that PPAR\u03b32 is phosphorylated within the LBD at Ser273 by Cdk5, a protein kinase that can be activated by various proinflammatory cytokines whose amounts are elevated in obesity 99, 100 . Notably, phosphorylation of PPAR\u03b3 by Cdk5 does not affect its adipogenic capacity but does alter the expression of a distinct group of genes that are aberrantly regulated in obesity 101 . Accordingly, Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of PPAR\u03b3 is increased in adipose tissue of HFD-fed mice and is inversely correlated with TZD-induced insulin sensitization in humans 101 . PPAR\u03b3 ligands prevent Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of PPAR\u03b3 103 . Interestingly, MRL24, a non-TZD compound with poor agonist activity but excellent antidiabetic effects, is very effective at blocking Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of PPAR\u03b3, suggesting that it may be possible to create new PPAR\u03b3 ligands that block Cdk5mediated PPAR\u03b3 phosphorylation yet lack classical agonism 101 . Recently a compound named SR1664 was identified as a PPAR\u03b3 agonist that has no adipogenic action in vitro 19 . Studies in obese mouse models have shown that SR1664 has strong antidiabetic actions similar to those elicited by TZDs but without many of the unwanted side effects. Although the poor pharmacokinetic properties of SR1664 will probably preclude its use in humans, these findings provide hope that it is possible to develop a new class of highly targeted and effective drugs that preserve the strong antidiabetic efficacy of TZDs yet eliminate many of the unwanted side effects that occur due to classical agonism on PPAR\u03b3 target genes 19 .\n\nSome TZDs are also capable of inducing BAT-like features in WAT 102 . In contrast to WAT that stores energy in the form of triacylglycerol, BAT burns energy through uncoupled respiration in the mitochondria 103 . This, combined with recent evidence that adult humans have metabolically active BAT, led to intense interest in activating these cells therapeutically 104 . Although PPAR\u03b3 has been known to promote BAT adipogenesis, the mechanism for the intrinsic 'browning' of WAT remains unclear 105 . However, it was recently reported that TZDs increase the half-life of PRDM16, a transcription factor that has been linked to BAT development and the browning of WAT 106 . Interestingly, only PPAR\u03b3 full agonists, such as rosiglitazone, and not partial agonists, such as MRL24, have been reported to elicit browning 106 . This raises the question of whether browning is directly linked to the potency of PPAR\u03b3 activation or whether browning-specific agonists can be identified. For example, compounds stabilizing PRDM16 and that lack full agonist activity may be promising for the treatment of obesity and diabetes. In this context, the recent evidence that deacetylation of PPAR\u03b3 at Lys268 and Lys293 by the NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) promotes the recruitment of PRDM16 to PPAR\u03b3 suggests a new pathway through which WAT browning could be induced 90 .\n\nAnother layer of control over PPAR\u03b3 activity involves its sumoylation, the covalent attachment of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) peptides that typically leads to repression of transcription factors 107 . Sumoylation of PPAR\u03b32 at Lys107 (or of PPAR\u03b31 at Lys77) in the AF1 region blocks its transcriptional activity, possibly by promoting corepressor recruitment 108 . The new findings with FGF21 knockout mice discussed above show that FGF21 increases PPAR\u03b3 activity in adipocytes by preventing PPAR\u03b3 sumoylation at Lys107, resulting in a feed-forward mechanism 22 . PPAR\u03b3 is also sumoylated at Lys395, which in macrophages results in its recruitment to the promoters of inflammatory genes, where it is thought to inhibit transcription by preventing clearance of co-repressor complexes 109 . Additionally, PPAR\u03b3 has been shown to be ubiquitinated, which is enhanced by ligand binding, as well as exposure of adipocytes to the cytokine interferon-\u03b3 110, 111 .\n\nAlthough the ubiquitin acceptor sites have yet to be identified, polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteosome is consistent with the short half-life (~2 h) of the PPAR\u03b3 protein and represents another level of control over PPAR\u03b3 activity 110 . In aggregate, these studies demonstrate the true potential to exploit ligand-and signaling-dependent posttranslational modification to both better understand the nature of insulin sensitization and lead to the development of a mechanistically new class of drugs that regulate PPAR\u03b3.\n\nAlthough TZDs clearly have potent antidiabetic effects, it is now apparent that they are accompanied by a myriad of unwanted side effects ranging from bone fractures to heart disease. The majority of these side effects were initially unpredictable, mainly because of a lack of awareness about the complexity of PPAR\u03b3 signaling. Recent findings have shed light on the intricacies of the PPAR\u03b3 pathway and are helping dissociate the benefits from the adverse side effects of TZDs. This multitude of PPAR\u03b3-mediated signaling pathways, including its recently recognized role as an inducer of secreted factors such as FGF1 and FGF21, opens up new opportunities for drug development 22, 23 . Evidence that FGF1 is required for insulin sensitization and that FGF21 delivery promotes insulin sensitization suggests two new biologic approaches to treat metabolic disease. Furthermore, it is now evident that the positive and negative effects of PPAR\u03b3 action are segmented to different cell-and tissue-types and that tissue-targeted TZDs could be a future therapeutic strategy. In addition to its action in classic metabolic tissues, which was the initial focus of previous PPAR\u03b3 research, the CNS is emerging as a potential new mediator of TZD-induced weight gain 20, 21 . Therefore, compounds that avoid activating brain PPAR\u03b3 may be promising. Adding further complexity, new post-translational modifications of PPAR\u03b3 have been recognized, including its phosphorylation at Ser273 by Cdk5, which does not affect its adipogenic capacity but does alter the expression of a distinct group of genes that are abnormally regulated in obesity 101 . Compounds have already been developed that specifically block phosphorylation at this site and seem to be effective insulin sensitizers despite poor classical PPAR\u03b3 agonist properties 19 .\n\nThese recent findings provide reason to believe that it will be possible to develop a new class of highly targeted and effective drugs that preserve the strong antidiabetic efficacy of TZDs yet eliminate many of the unwanted side effects. As previously discussed, this could be achieved in a variety of ways and may ultimately include a combination of approaches, including targeting specific PPAR\u03b3 pathways, selectively agonizing or antagonizing PPAR\u03b3 in certain tissues, altering specific post-translational modifications of PPAR\u03b3 or inducing certain epigenetic modifications. Fortunately, many of these ideas are not without precedent. The development of ligands that selectively modulate a nuclear receptor has been demonstrated with selective estrogen receptor modulators, in which agonism for the estrogen receptor is achieved in one tissue while partial agonism or even antagonism occurs in another tissue 112 . For PPAR\u03b3, this has been termed the 'selective PPAR\u03b3 modulator' concept, which is based on the idea that structurally distinct PPAR\u03b3 ligands will result in unique receptor-ligand conformations with signature affinities for different co-regulators, thereby allowing discrete gene activation profiles within different cells and tissue types 113 . The relatively large ligand-binding pocket of PPAR\u03b3 facilitates the binding of structurally diverse endogenous and synthetic ligands [114] [115] [116] . In addition to SR1664, several selective PPAR\u03b3 modulators with minimal side effects have been identified 113, 116 . In this regard it might also be possible to administer TZDs in conjunction with certain epigenetic modifiers, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors 72, 117 . Alternatively, a new combinatorial approach that allows for peptide-mediated selective tissue targeting of nuclear receptors may be beneficial, as has recently been demonstrated for an estrogen receptor agonist 118 . We have seen from studies with Cdk5 that it is possible to design compounds that alter specific post-translational modifications of PPAR\u03b3 and prevent unwanted side effects but retain antidiabetic potency. As mentioned above, meta-analyses of clinical trials have attributed increased cardiovascular risks to rosiglitazone but not pioglitazone. A possible explanation is the observation that pioglitazone has a favorable impact on circulating lipids, notably decreasing triglyceride concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes, whereas rosiglitazone has the opposite effect [119] [120] [121] . Although the mechanism underlying this difference has not been elucidated fully, it may be explained at least in part by pioglitazone having more offtarget effects, such as PPAR\u03b1 agonist activity 122, 123 , although other differential actions have been reported, such as increased skeletal-muscle mitochondrial respiration 124 . This and other evidence suggest that there may be a role for mixed PPAR receptor targeting. In this regard, a number of such dual PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 agonists have been developed 123, 125 , but safety concerns surrounding heart failure and renal impairment have led to the withdrawal of some of these agents from clinical trials. Currently one compound, aleglitazar, an equipotent agonist of PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3, is in a phase 3 trial in patients with recent acute coronary syndrome and type 2 diabetes 123 . Additionally, RXR-selective ligands (referred to as rexinoids) that selectively activate the RXR-PPAR\u03b3 heterodimer may also be promising targets, especially because isotypes of RXR have been shown to be differentially regulated in pathological conditions such as obesity [126] [127] [128] [129] . Alternatively, activating autophagy or specific lipases could be a strategy to generate bioactive lipid ligands for PPAR\u03b3 130, 131 . It is also worth considering that both the benefits and adverse effects of TZDs could result from activation of non-PPAR\u03b3 targets such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 132 . Benefit may also be derived from changing the way we screen for PPAR\u03b3-targeted therapeutics from potent, long-lasting compounds to less specific and less stable compounds that allow for more rapid clearance and shorter duration of action. Along with appropriate dosing schedules, this strategy may lead to the development of therapies that act in a more circadian manner and mimic physiological fasting and feeding cycles. Nevertheless, because the US Food and Drug Administration already demands cardiovascular safety data for all classes of antidiabetic agents, it might be beneficial to target this clinical outcome upfront, either in the compound identification stage or during preclinical studies in nonhuman primates. A summary of clinical trial experience with TZDs has been tabulated in a recent review of this drug class 74 .\n\nDespite the substantial progress that has been made on the subject, there is still much to be clarified regarding PPAR\u03b3 signaling, and several important questions remain. Both FGF1 and FGF21 are regulated by PPAR\u03b3 in adipose tissue, but why are they both there, what are their relative contributions, and do they have unique or overlapping functions with each other (as well as with other transducers of PPAR\u03b3-mediated insulin sensitization, such as adiponectin)? In this regard, crosstalk between PPAR\u03b3 and various cytokines and transcription factors also exists and may act coordinately with these factors to promote insulin sensitization 133 . Also, how mechanistically can FGF21, which normally circulates as a hepatic hormone, act locally when expressed in adipose tissue? Further investigation into the composition of the extracellular matrix of adipose tissue will be important, especially when considering how to target these molecules therapeutically. In this regard, FGF21 has been administered to mice, pharmacologically producing strong antidiabetic effects but also causing bone loss 35, 40, 42 . Although the metabolic importance of the PPAR\u03b3-FGF1 signaling pathway was revealed through dietary manipulation in knockout mouse studies, it will be interesting to see whether FGF1 can itself serve as a pharmacologically independent regulator of glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance.\n\nTissue-specific knockouts of PPAR\u03b3 in mice have been crucial in revealing that almost every tissue examined is implicated in some aspect of TZD-induced insulin sensitization. Although it is clear that adipose tissue is a central mediator of these insulin-sensitizing effects, the relative importance of other tissues in TZD-mediated insulin sensitization, as well as in potential tissue crosstalk, needs to be clarified, particularly in light of the observation that individual loss of PPAR\u03b3 from a single cell or tissue type can effect wholebody insulin sensitization. One feature may be that loss of PPAR\u03b3 could predispose an animal to chronic inflammation, which may promote insulin resistance. In reality, the field has not carefully explored whether these deficiencies can be rescued by increasing the amounts of a different sensitizer or through the use of another small molecule (such as glucocorticoids, LXR or PPAR\u03b4 agonists) known to suppress macrophage inflammation. There are many fruitful areas here for future study. Another intriguing aspect of many recent studies is their association with HFD, which seems to be required to elicit many of the PPAR\u03b3 phenotypes. It is possible that one or several fatty acid ligands produced by HFD feeding may mediate components of these effects. If this is the case, it will be important to determine from a nutritional point of view whether such natural molecules could selectively trigger different PPAR\u03b3 signaling, including the regulation of FGFs, the activation of PPAR\u03b3 in the brain or the phosphorylation of PPAR\u03b3 by Cdk5. In this regard, PPAR\u03b3 has been shown to have distinct transcriptional activities in normal, nonpathological conditions as compared to in obese or diabetic states 129, [134] [135] [136] . There are also important questions regarding post-translational modifications of PPAR\u03b3. For example, how does phosphorylation of PPAR\u03b3 by Cdk5 alter the expression of a distinct subset of genes, and does it affect co-regulator recruitment? Does this phosphorylation occur in other tissues, and if so, is it also induced by HFD? Additionally, although various post-translational modifications of PPAR\u03b3 have been identified, it is not clear what reverses this process. Factors such as phosphatases are probably just as crucial in modulating PPAR\u03b3 activity. Lastly, we must also keep in mind that much of our knowledge of PPAR\u03b3 signaling is based on data in rodent models, which will not always translate directly to humans.\n\nWe have highlighted just a few of the questions that have been sparked by recent findings. Many intriguing avenues of PPAR\u03b3 research have been opened and hold the potential to ultimately lead to newer classes of more selective molecules. As we move forward with the development of the next generation of PPAR\u03b3-targeted therapeutics, we must focus on strategies that retain the 'good' potent insulin-sensitizing effects of current PPAR\u03b3-specific drugs and simultaneously reduce or eliminate the 'bad' associated side effects. Recent findings have provided insight into the mechanisms underlying the insulin-sensitizing effects of PPAR\u03b3 as well as its adverse effects, suggesting new approaches to drug design. As discussed here, these new strategies will probably involve changing the way we screen for compounds, focusing on downstream effectors of PPAR\u03b3-mediated insulin sensitization, targeting specific post-translational modifications of PPAR\u03b3 and selectively agonizing or antagonizing PPAR\u03b3 in specific tissues. A combination of these approaches will aid in the development of safer yet highly efficacious molecules and provide hope for a promising future of PPAR\u03b3-targeted therapeutics. PPAR\u03b3 has multiple roles in adipose tissue. HFD, ligands or TZDs (1) activate PPAR\u03b3-RXR functional heterodimers (2) and maintain metabolic homeostasis through direct regulation of genes harboring PPAR response elements (PPREs) involved in adipocyte differentiation, lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis, as well as the expression of adipose secreted factors that act as transducers for PPAR\u03b3 (3) .
