{"title": "Modeling the Epidemic Dynamics and Control of COVID-19 Outbreak in China", "body": "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was initially identified in mid-December 2019 in Wuhan, China [1, 2] . The earliest patients in Wuhan are related to exposure from a seafood market. Later, the number of patients grows drastically due to human-to-human transmission [3] . The incubation period of COVID-19 is reported to be 3-7 days, at most 14 days, which varies greatly among patients [2] . The novel coronavirus is believed to be infectious during incubation period when no symptoms are shown on the patients [4] , an important characteristics differentiating COVID-19 from its close relative SARS. Considerable measures have been implemented to control the outbreak in Wuhan and China, mainly by quarantine to reduce transmission. On Jan 23rd, 2019, Wuhan restricted travel outside the city. Any person exposed to COVID-19 is required to perform a self-isolation for 14 days. Around Jan 25rd, 2019, nucleic acid kit was developed to diagnose the patients. On Feb 12th, 2020, clinical diagnosis was used to assist the confirmation of infection in Hubei province. Nonetheless, has spread to all provinces of China and more than 30 other countries in the last two months [5, 6] .\n\nCOVID-19 has three features that make it hard to describe with the existing epidemic models including SIR, SEIR etc [7, 8] . Firstly, COVID-19 has a relatively long incubation period, which causes a time delay between real dynamic and the dailyobserved case numbers. Secondly, the epidemic trend heavily depends on multiple artificial factors, including local medical resources, quarantine measures, and the efficiency of confirmation approaches, which should be explicitly modeled. For example, the outbreak is more severe in Wuhan compared to other cities in China that constrains the medical resources, therefore the infected need a longer time to be confirmed and reported in the official released numbers. This potentially leads to a larger difference between real and reported infected cases in Wuhan than in other places.\n\nThis could also explain why a sudden increase of confirmed infected cases was observed when clinical diagnosis was adopted in confirmation in Wuhan. Lastly, the quarantine measures are widely implemented, and the quarantined have a lower chance to infect the susceptible individuals. This is critical for controlling the spread across China.\n\nThe characteristics of COVID-19 outbreak and control are distinct from existing infectious diseases, and the existing epidemic models cannot be applied to describe the observed data directly. We thus propose to use a simple SUQC model (Susceptible, Unquarantined infected, Quarantined infected, Confirmed infected). SUQC distinguishes the infected individuals to be un-quarantined, quarantined but not confirmed, and confirmed. Among the three types, the confirmed number is the data we can directly observe from the official released report. Only un-quarantined infected have ability to infect susceptible individuals and affect the development of the epidemic. In our proposed model, the quarantine rate parameter is used to quantify the strength of quarantine policy on the development of epidemics, and the confirmation rate parameter is used to measure the efficiency of confirmation based on the released data.\n\nThe two parameters can be solved from fitting the observed confirmed cases over time.\n\nNote that the model contains only four variables and three parameters to model both artificial factors and characteristics of epidemics using the data we can directly observe.\n\nWe expect that the simplified model will not over fit the data given the short time span, but will adequately characterize the essential dynamics.\n\nWe apply the SUQC model to the daily released numbers of confirmed cases in Wuhan city, Hubei province (excluding Wuhan), China (excluding Hubei) and four first-tier cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. The parameters of the model were inferred, and used to predict the future trends of epidemics in China. The data of confirmed infected numbers includes 33 consecutive daily records from Jan .

The parameters in the model, such as the quarantine rate, are time varying, and thus we divided data into different stages (according to the changes of measures during the epidemic), and we assumed the parameters within each stage are relatively stable. We defined time before Jan 30, 2020 as stage \u2160, and after Jan 30th, 2020 as stage \u2161. To guarantee enough data points within the two stages, the start and end of the stages may vary by one or two days.\n\nWuhan has recently undergone stricter measures of quarantine and transmission limiting, and clinical diagnosis was adopted after Feb 12th, we thus further did a stage III analysis of the dynamics in Wuhan using data after Feb 13th. Figure 1 shows the inference and prediction of epidemic dynamics of Wuhan using stage \u2160, \u2161 and \u2162 data respectively. The first 15 daily data points (from Jan 28th to Feb 11th) of stage \u2161 were used to fit the model and infer parameters. The following 10 daily data points were used as test data for evaluating the performance of the model.\n\nIn Figure 1 With the inferred parameters, we further plot the long-term predictions of the numbers of total infected ( I ), un-quarantined infected ( U ), quarantined infected ( Q ) and cumulative Confirmed infections ( C ) in Wuhan (Figure 1(A) ). The end time (increment of confirmed infections equals zero) is predicted to be 147 days from Jan 28th, 2020.\n\nThe total number of infected individuals is 62,577 (Table 1) .\n\nWe can do a similar analysis using stage \u2160 data of Wuhan. The stage \u2160 data is informative for predicting the epidemic trend assuming no rigorous quarantine and control measures. The first 10 daily data points (from Jan 20th) were used to infer the parameters. The rest data points were used to test the performance of the model ( Figure   1 (C-D)). As clearly seen in Figure 1 (C), the predicted numbers of ) (t C and ) (t I increase dramatically, which are far beyond the observed numbers after Jan 21. The number of total infected can be as large as 8,923,823, and the epidemic lasts for a much longer time (328 days, see Table 1 ). The dramatic difference between predictions from stage \u2160 and stage \u2161 data indicates the preventing measures and quarantines, such as travel restrict, are very efficient in controlling the outburst of the epidemic.\n\nSince more strict quarantine and traffic control measures were executed recently to inhibit the infection of COVID-19 in Wuhan and clinical diagnosis was adopted after Feb 12th, we also analyzed the stage \u2162 data (from Feb 13th). The estimated quarantine rate is 0.6185, much higher than that of 0.3917 estimated based on stage \u2161 data. The total number of infected individuals is estimated to be 49,510, indicating a further acceleration of the epidemic end (Table 1) .\n\nSimilar analysis was accomplished on stage \u2160 and \u2161 data of Hubei province (excluding Wuhan), the whole country (excluding Hubei), and four tier-1 cities in China   (Figures 2-3, S1-S4, Tables 1-2) . Overall, the model predictions are in high accuracy.\n\nWe see similar trends in these regions: the predicted numbers of infected are distinct between results from the two stage data, indicating the necessity and efficiency of quarantine and control measures. We note that even with stage \u2160 data, Beijing have a reproductive number smaller than 1 ( Figure S1 , Table 2 , 0.8840), indicating an earlystage prompt and effective response to COVID-19. Figures 2-3 , S1-S4, we notice that the difference between ) (t C and ) (t I in Wuhan is the biggest. Wuhan has the most infected individuals than any other places in China (more than 50 %), highly beyond the limit of local clinical resources, leading to a long waiting time for confirmation, and the lowest confirmation .

Using stage \u2161 data, the estimated number of ) (t U individuals in Wuhan ( Figure   1 (A)) on Feb 12th is still as high as 3,509. The person-to-person transmission will last for more than two months to mid May 2020. However, estimated with stage \u2162 data, the quarantine rate of Wuhan increases to 0.6185 and the un-quarantined infected individuals decreases to 334 on Feb 21th, 2020 (Figure 1(E) ).\n\nAfter fitting the model with the recent data from stage \u2161 and stage \u2162 (for Wuhan), we make a series of predictions about future dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. S is the same as that in existing infectious disease models, e.g. SIR and SEIR.\n\n, the number of infected and un-quarantined individuals that can be either presymptomatic or symptomatic. Different from E in the SEIR model, U are infectious, and can render a susceptible to be un-quarantined infected.\n\n, the number of quarantined infected individuals. The un-quarantined infected become Quarantined infected by isolation or hospitalization, and lose the ability of infecting the susceptible.\n\n, the number of confirmed infected cases. The number of confirmed infections is released by the official agency or media, which may be the only variable with observation that we can access. Note that C is usually smaller than the number of real infected individuals, due to the limited sensitivity of diagnosis methods. The duration of incubation can also cause a time delay of confirmation. Nevertheless, C is also the number useful for monitoring and predicting the trend of epidemic dynamics.\n\nBesides the aforementioned variables, we have a composite variable\n\n, representing the real cumulative number of infected individuals at time t . The limitation of detection methods and the medical resources can greatly delay the confirmation process, insomuch the confirmation proportion I C / is less than 1 and time-varying. R , the number of removed individuals, is not included in the model as in the SIR/SEIR models. Once the infected are quarantined, we assume their probability of infecting susceptible individuals is zero, and thus no matter the infected are recovered or not, they have no effect on the dynamics of the epidemic system.\n\n\uf061 is the infection rate, the mean number of new infected caused by an un-quarantined infected per day. \uf073 is the subsequent confirmation rate of those infected that are not confirmed by the conventional methods, but confirmed with some additional tests. If no other special approaches used, \uf073 is set to 0. Combing two sources of confirmation approaches\n\nis the total confirmation rate.\n\n\uf064 is the confirmation rate of the un-quarantined infected who can be identified as confirmed infections without being quarantined.\n\nWe thus set up a set of ODE equations to model the dynamics of an infectious disease and the control by artificial factors (Eqn. 1). In the model, U goes directly to C , or go through Q indirectly. Actually, the former can be viewed as a special case of the later with zero delay time during C Q \uf0ae . Thus we delete the direct way and simplified the model as Eqn. 2.\n\nFrom the above SUQC model, we can further define some biologically meaningful parameters, for monitoring and predicting the trend of disease: Some parameters can be calculated beforehand using the public data directly. We calculate the infection rate \uf061 using the confirmed infected numbers of Wuhan city during Jan 20th and Jan 27th. By fitting an exponential curve, we get 0.2967 \uf03d \uf061 . .

We try different initial values in parameter optimization, and notice that the inferred parameter values are not sensitive to the provided initial values.\n\nNote that the loss function (Eqn 3) may give too much weight to later observations since the cumulative case numbers are higher than earlier days. We tried another two weighted loss functions to better integrate information across the whole epidemic (Eqns S1 and S2 in the Supplementary information), and compared the prediction of the loss functions. The prediction seems robust on the choice of loss functions (Figures S5 and   S6 ). In practice the loss functions may be chosen by their performances evaluated on the test data. with stage \u2160 data, the first 10 data points (from Jan 20th) are used to infer the parameters, and the remaining points are used to test the model; (E) prediction using stage \u2162 data; (F) Model-fitting and testing with stage \u2162 data.
