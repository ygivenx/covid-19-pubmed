{"title": "Virus-Specific Read-Through Codon Preference Affects Infectivity of Chimeric Cucumber Green Mottle Mosaic Viruses Displaying a Dengue Virus Epitope", "body": "The development of plant virus vectors as in planta expression systems for foreign\ngenes provides an attractive alternative biotechnological approach\nfor peptide expression [1\u20135]. This method has been\nexploited in vaccine production, where small foreign peptides are expressed as\na fusion with the viral coat proteins. Essentially, an insertion site has to be\ndetermined in the virus genome so that the resulting product will be displayed\non the surface of the virus particle which is then propagated in plants and consequently\nisolated and used as antigen presenting vehicles [5, 6]. Modifications that do\nnot interfere with the normal functions of the particular virus are a\nprerequisite for this peptide fusion approach. One strategy suggests that\nforeign gene segments could  be fused to the terminus of a viral\ngene in a way that permits the production of both the fusion product and the\nnative viral protein, thus avoiding interference with normal gene functions. \nThe success of this epitope presentation strategy depends on a detailed\nknowledge of virus structure at the atomic level, which is only available for a\nlimited number of viruses.\n\nWe\nhave recently developed Cucumber green\nmottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) as a candidate for expressing antigenic\npeptides in plants [7]. CGMMV is a tobamovirus with a genome size of ~6.4 kb\nwhich has been well characterized both biologically [8, 9] and structurally [10, 11]. In this study, a truncated dengue virus\ntype 2 envelope (E) protein binding region from amino acid 379 to 423 (EB4) was\ninserted into the end of the coat protein (CP) open reading frame (ORF) of a\npreviously constructed CGMMV full-length clone, pCGT7X [7]. The antigenic\npeptide was chosen based on a recent study that suggests its importance in\nenabling dengue virus to bind to specific host cell receptors (S. Abu Bakar  personal communication).\nThe present study explores the possibility of extrapolating the CGMMV antigenic\nepitope presentation system for developing diagnostics and potentially\ntherapeutics against dengue. The study was also used to challenge the size\nlimits of foreign gene insertion into the CGMMV vector as in the previous study\nthe hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) used was only 33 amino acids [7].\n\nThe 45 amino\nacid-long EB4 protein used in this study has been previously shown to react\nwith the dengue-specific antibody 3H5-1 (S. Abu Bakar  personal communication).\n\t\t\t\t\n\nThe EB4 coding\nsequence was amplified from a pCANTAB 5E vector carrying the virus gene using 3\nprimer pair sets. The resulting PCR products were purified then digested\novernight with HindIII restriction\nendonuclease, with the same treatment carried out on the full-length clone of\nCGMMV (pCGT7X, ~9.0 kb) previously constructed [7]. The digested PCR products\nand the linearized pCGT7X were purified following 1% agarose gel\nelectrophoresis, and then ligated to form pRT, pRG, both containing the TMV\nread-through sequence [12] and pCG+FSRTRE (containing the CGMMV read-through\nsequence) [13], respectively (Figure 1). The three primer sets used in the\namplifications were as follows.\n\nForward\nRT (5\u2032-CCAAGCTTGCCAATAGCAATTAATCATAGGAGTAGAGC-3\u2032) and Reverse E\n(5\u2032-CCAAGCTTCTCCAAAATCCCAAGCTGT-3\u2032) for construction of clone pRT, Forward (RT) TGG\n(5\u2032-AAGCTTGGCAATAGCAATTAATCATAGGAGTAGAGCCG-3\u2032)  and Reverse Q\n(5\u2032-CCAAGCTTGTCCAAAATCCCAAGCTGTGT-3\u2032) for clone pRG, and Forward SRT (5\u2032-CCAAGCTTCCAAATAGCAATTAATCATAGGAGTAGAGCCG-3\u2032) and Reverse E\n(5\u2032-CCAAGCTTCTCCAAAATCCCAAGCTGT-3\u2032) for clone pCG+FSRTRE.\n\nThe\ntemplates used in the in vitro transcription reactions were synthesized through long-distance PCR (LD-PCR) in\n50 \u03bcL PCR cocktails containing 1X HF Buffer of Phusion DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes,\nEspoo, Finland)\nwith 1.5 mM MgCl2 (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland), 0.2 mM dNTP mix, 0.5 \u03bcM forward primer,\nCGT7dG  (5\u2032-CCGAGCTCGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTTTTA-3\u2032), 0.5 \u03bcM reverse primer, CGMMV\n3\u2032-UTR (5\u2032-TGGGCCCCTACCCGGGGAAAAGGGGGGAT-3\u2032), 10\u201320 ng of DNA template, and 1 U\nof  Phusion\nDNA Polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland). The reaction was set up in 0.2 mL tubes, and the\nthermal cycling was conducted with initial denaturation at 98\u00b0C for 60 seconds,\nfollowed by 30 cycles of 98\u00b0C denaturation for 10 seconds, annealing at 63\u00b0C\nfor 20 seconds and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 1 minute and 50 seconds, and finally\nan extension step at 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes. The amplified product was purified\nthrough phenol-chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The\npellet was dissolved in an appropriate volume of RNase-free distilled water to\n1 \u03bcg/\u03bcL and stored at \u221220\u00b0C till further use. The in vitro transcription was carried out using the (Ambion, Calif, USA)\nHigh Yield Capped T7 RNA Transcription Kit according to the manufacturer\nprotocol. Aliquots of the in vitro-synthesized\ntranscripts were denatured and electrophoresed alongside RNA markers showing\nits integrity and the expected transcript size of approximately 6.5 kb. Since no\nDNase I treatment was done, traces of DNA template of the transcription\nreactions were detected.\n\nMuskmelon\n(C. melo) plants were used as host\nplants for virus propagation. Plants used in this study were maintained in a\ngrowth room at 25\u00b0C with 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness. Healthy 10-day-old plantlets with\ncotyledons and small first leaf were used for inoculation.\n\nOne\ntranscription reaction was used to inoculate 2 plantlets by gently rubbing the\nreaction mixture over carborundum-dusted\nfirst leaf and cotyledons of 10-day-old plantlets. Mock inoculation was done by\ngently rubbing distilled water onto carborundum-dusted first leaves. The excess inoculum was rinsed\noff using distilled water from the leaf surfaces 60 minutes after inoculation.\n\nTotal\nRNA was isolated from the new leaf of the inoculated and healthy plants using\nRNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN). RT-PCR was performed using AccuPower RT/PCR\nPreMix (Bioneer, Daejeon, South Korea)\nwith primers CGMMV 3\u2032UTR (5\u2032-TGGGCCCCTACCCGGGGAAAAGGGGGGAT-3\u2032) paired with Pst I sense (5\u2032-TAGGAAAAAACCAGAAGATCTGCAGGAATTTTTCTC-3\u2032)\nor C5500F (5\u2032-GTCGCTACAACTAACTCTATTATCAAAAAGGGTC-3\u2032). Reactions were carried\nout according to the manufacturer protocols. Infected plants will give a PCR-amplified\nproduct of approximately 2.2 kb (with PstI\nsense and CGMMV 3\u2032UTR primers) or 0.85 kb (with C5500F and CGMMV 3\u2032UTR primers). \nRT-PCR reactions were carried out for plants at 14, 21, and 30\nday-postinoculation (dpi).\n\nPlant\nvirus isolation procedures used in this study were modified from [8]. Infected plants showing\ntypical symptoms were harvested, weighed, and homogenized in ice-cold 0.1 M phosphate buffer\n(pH 7.0 containing 1% of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) at 1 mL/g of plant material for 10\nminutes using a mechanical blender. The homogenate was filtered through 2\nlayers of cheesecloth and then mixed with equal volume of chloroform:butanol\n(1:1). The mixture was then stirred for 1-2 hours at room\ntemperature and then the organic phase was separated from the mixture through\ncentrifugation at 8000 g for 15 minutes. The aqueous layer was transferred to a\nbeaker, 100 mL of NaCl (4 g/L) and PEG6000 added, and the mixture stirred on ice\nfor 1 hour. The precipitated virus was separated from the solution through\ncentrifugation at 10 000 g for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The resulting pellet was\nreconstituted in 10 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.0. Any undissolved material\nwas cleared by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 30 minutes at 12\u00b0C. Then 0.2 M EDTA\n(pH 7) (50 mL/L) was added to the supernatant and the mixture subjected to\ncentrifugation at 110 000 g for 90 minutes at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was discarded,\nand the pellet was left to air dry. The virus pellet was then reconstituted in\n100 \u03bcL of distilled water and stored at 4\u00b0C until used.\n\nAnalyses\nof sequences of the amplified products were carried using BioEdit Sequence\nAlignment Editor Software (version 6.0.5) (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html). \nThe pI and charge values of the coat protein were calculated using the protein calculator\ndeveloped by Chris Putnam of The Scripps Research Institute (http://www.scripps.edu/~cdputnam/protcalc.html).\n\nIn this study, the\nchimeric CGMMV vectors pRT, pRG, and pCG-FSRTRE were constructed by inserting\nthe EB4 coding sequence to the end of the CGMMV CP ORF in plasmid pCGT7X. The\nmaps of these constructed clones are shown in Figure 1, which indicates their\nrespective position of the primers during amplification and cloning procedures. \nMaps of plasmids pCGT7X are\ncarrying the wild-type CGMMV, and pCANTAB 5E are\ncarrying EB4 with their respective\npriming sites are also as indicated in Figure 1. The genome size of wild-type\nCGMMV is approximately 6.4 kb (without the plasmid backbone), and the resulting\nchimeric CGMMV genome would be approximately 6.5 kb in size and contains the EB4\nand read-through sequences as well as inserted HindIII restriction recognition sites and additional nucleotides\nenabling in-frame cloning. The pRT and pRG chimeric clones were constructed\nwith the read-through sequence of TMV (CAA-UAG-CAA-UUA). This leaky sequence\nmeets the minimal sequence requirement for effective read-through of the stop\ncodon [12] and had been used successfully in previous reports [14].\n\nThe\ntemplates for in vitro\ntranscription of these two clones were generated through LD-PCR (data not shown). \nThe resulting amplified products (~6.5 kb) consisted of a T7 promoter fused with\nthe chimeric CGMMV genome carrying EB4. Transcripts produced from the two\nconstructs were separately tested for infectivity by inoculating the host\nplants. After repeated attempts, both the pRT- and pRG-generated transcripts\ndid not cause infection of the inoculated plants (Table 1). There was no evidence\nof virus genomic material in the inoculated plant tissues tested (data not\nshown). It is speculated that the read-through sequence of TMV may not be suitable\nfor the CGMMV chimeric clones, hence contributing to the absence of infectious\nvirus transcripts. To overcome this possibility, another chimeric clone\n(pCG+FSRTRE) was constructed using the read-through sequence AAA-UAG-CAA-UUA of\nthe wild-type CGMMV itself (Figure 1). The template for in vitro transcription,\nbased on the pCG+FSRTRE clone, was generated through LD-PCR. The in vitro transcription products\n(Figure 2) were used in inoculation studies. The new leaves of plants\ninoculated with pCG+FSRTRE-derived transcripts showed evidence of virus\ninfection with four out of eight plants showing a typical symptom of CGMMV\ninfection, which include the green mottle mosaic appearance on day 14 pI (Table 1 and Figure 3). \nInfection could be detected through RT-PCR when total RNA of new noninoculated\nleaf was used as template. Detection of the virus by RT-PCR (Figure 4) suggests\nthat the viruses had moved from the inoculated leaf to new leaves. This implies\nthat the chimeric virus pCG+FSRTRE carrying the read-through sequence from the CGMMV\ngenome (AAA-UAG-CAA-UUA) was\ninfectious and that the virus particles were able to assemble. The plants,\nhowever, continued to grow without any further noticeable symptoms. Virus\nparticles were extracted from the infected plants and an aliquot was\nelectrophoretically separated on 15% SDS-PAGE (Figure 5) resulting in two distinct\nsuggesting that the virus population consisted of two species of coat proteins,\nthe EB4-CP fusion (larger in size) and the wild-type CGMMV CP (smaller in\nsize). The ratio of modified to unmodified CP was approximately 1:1.\n\nApart\nfrom the usage of leaky UAG amber stop codons, it has been reported that pI:charge\ncan affect the production of  viable\nrecombinant virus [15]. The pI of the epitope is thought to be an important\nfactor as the hybrid coat protein pI:charge value can affect epitope\npresentation. It was also reported that TMV was more tolerant to positively\ncharged epitopes on its surface. Thus, it was initially speculated that the\nfailure in expression of the foreign peptide was possibly due to the pI:charge\nvalue of recombinant CGMMV CP which was different from the wild-type CGMMV CP\npI:charge value (Table 2).\n\n\nTable 2 shows the isoelectric\npoint (pI) and charge of the wild-type CGMMV CP, the read-through recombinant\nCGMMV CP, and the EB4 insert. The charge of the EB4 insert is positive and potentially\nsuitable for expression on the surface of the CGMMV CP [2]. Hence, the inserted\npeptide is speculated to be expressed if the pI:charge value of modified virus\nCP resembles the pI:charge value of unmodified virus CP. Earlier transcripts\n(data not shown) generated from fusion clones without a read-through sequence,\nwhere their pI values deviated significantly (>6.0) from the wild-type CP\n(5.08), were not able to cause infection in inoculated plants leading to the\nsuggestion initially that pI:charge value played an important role in virus\nparticle assembly and infectivity. Thus, the pI value of the recombinant CP constructs\nwas adjusted to more\nclosely resemble the wild-type CP pI value by inserting the acidic amino acid\n(glutamate) to the 3\u2032 end of CP (Table 2). The experiments (Table 1), however, showed\nthat although the pI was still higher than that of the wild type (Table 2), the\nconstruct pCG+FSRTRE remained infectious. This\nimplies that infectivity of the clones was not directly related to the\ndeviation in pI value with the wild-type virus CGMMV CP.\n\nSequencing\nwas carried out on RT-PCR-amplified products of viral RNA extracted from\nputative chimeric virus particles at 30 days postinoculation (dpi) and total\nplant RNA isolated from inoculated plant materials at 14 and 21 dpi to  confirm the expression of EB4. Sequence\nanalysis was done using BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor Software (version 6.0.5)\n(http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html). The chimeric CP carried the\ncomplete EB4 sequence within its genome at 14 dpi (Figure 6). However, the EB4\nsequence appeared to be truncated at 21 dpi with an upstream portion of the EB4\nsequence was not present. Only part of the downstream sequence of EB4 was\ndetected together with the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the CGMMV. EB4 was totally\nundetectable at 30 dpi. Interestingly, the 5\u2032 end of introduced read-through\nsequence (position 490 to 501) was retained in the genome. The introduced HindIII recognition site at EB4\ndownstream from position 639 to 644 was found to have been deleted after 30 dpi.\n\nEven\nthough only a single band was visible on RT-PCR screening, it was suspected\nthat there could be products with similar sizes which could not be separated in\nnormal agarose gel electrophoresis, therefore, the RT-PCR products from the\nchimeric CGMMV RNA at 30 dpi were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector and subjected\nto sequence analyses. The results (Figure 7) confirmed the absence of the EB4\nsequence, except for clone pR_P3U4 (from nucleotide position of 702 to 746),\nwhere only part of the downstream sequence of the EB4 was detected together\nwith the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the CGMMV. The 5\u2032 end of introduced\nread-through sequence of AAA-TAG-CAA-TTA (position 594 to 605) was retained\nwithin the genome for all sequenced clones (Figure 7). The introduced HindIII site from position 742 to 747\nwas deleted for clones pR_P3U1, pR_P3U3, and pR_P3U11 after 30 dpi.\n\nThe\nchimeric CGMMV sequence analyses showed one common similarity (Figures 6 and 7),\nthat is, that part of the read-through amber stops codon sequence, and additional nucleotides\n\u201cCC-AAA-TAG\u201d were retained for all sequenced clones. This suggests that\ndeletion had occurred within the host plant. The sequence analysis also showed\nthat the EB4 was not fully expressed in the putative chimeric CGMMV. The\npositive results from the initial RT-PCR screening of transcript-inoculated\nplants at 14 dpi (Figure 4) suggest the presence of EB4. The EB4 was, however,\nnot detectable at 30 dpi, and only present in some (< 50% tested) plants at\n21 dpi. These findings strongly suggest that deletion had occurred within the\nhost plants after 14 dpi. The sequence analyses in this section are summarized\nin Table 3.\n\nPlant\nvirus vectors-based expression systems have been widely studied for their\ndevelopment as antigen presentation systems as well as for the production of\npharmaceutically important peptides. The CGMMV has been previously shown to be\nsuitable for expression of foreign peptide [7]. In this study, CGMMV vector was\nused to express a 45 amino\nacid EB4 gene. The integration of the EB4 gene into the end of CGMMV\ncoat protein gene was done via a leaky UAG read-through sequence.\n\nTranscripts\ngenerated from chimeric clones of pRT and pRG carrying CAA-UAG-CAA-UUA\nread-through codon sequences were not infectious. This is possibly caused by\nthe failure of self assembly [16], and thus none of the inoculated plants was systemically\ninfected. The assembly of CGMMV into virus particle has been shown to be\nessential for the viral movement through phloem [17], hence another chimeric\nclone pCG+FSRTRE was constructed carrying read-through sequence (AAA-UAG-CAA-UUA)\nfrom the wild-type CGMMV genome. The clone containing this read-through signal\nwas infectious and produced chimeric CGMMV (Table 1 and Figures 4 and 5). It is,\nthus, postulated that there is a read-through signal preference between different\nspecies of tobamoviruses, in this case between TMV and CGMMV causing possibly\nviral particle assembly failure. It has also been shown that KGMMV, the\ntobamovirus, which has the closest genome similarity to CGMMV [13] also\nutilizes the same CGMMV read-through signal reaffirming the differences between\nthe tobamoviruses. Additionally, unlike other plant virus vectors [15, 18],\nthis study reaffirms that with CGMMV pI deviation did not appear to be a factor\naffecting infectivity [7].\n\nThe\nchimeric (carrying the EB4) and putative wild-type CGMMV were shown to coexist\nin the virus population of the infected plants (Figure 5). Previous reports\nshow that the efficiencies of the leaky UAG codon varied from 0.5% to 5% so\nthat the ratio of modified to unmodified CP would be between 1:200 and 1:20 [12, 19]. However, in this study, relatively high levels of chimeric coat protein\nwas observed (Figure 5) giving a ratio of modified to unmodified CP of\napproximately 1:1. It has been suggested that muskmelon host plant could be\nproducing higher levels of translation nonsense suppressor tRNA making the\napplication of the translation read-through signal favorable in this host [7].\n\nDue to their\nrelatively higher rate of mutation during replication, RNA viruses are evolving\nrapidly and this is the basis of their ubiquity and adaptability [20, 21]. In this study, it is shown that the EB4 gene sequence\ncarried by the chimeric CGMMV was systemically removed during the infection\nprocess. The order of the removal of the transgene was speculated to be the 5\u2032\nto 3\u2032 direction (Figures 6 and 7). This is further supported by the detection\nof two additional nucleotides together with the read-through sequence\n\u201cCC-AAA-TAG\u201d downstream from the CGMMV CP ORF. This report shows the temporal\nin-host truncation of the transgene from a chimeric virus in a natural host. \nRecent report has shown truncation occurring in transgenic plants expressing\nthe same or similar transgenes as the chimeric virus [22] suggesting targeting\nby a resistance mechanism or competition with the parental virus as the\nmechanism involved. The exact mechanism of truncation of the transgene in our\nstudy is less clear as a previous study using the same vector and host with a\ndifferent transgene did not exhibit the same instability [7]. The larger size\nof the EB4 peptide in comparison to the Hepatitis B epitope, however, suggests\nthat the truncation mechanism or transgene recognition by the virus was size\ndependent.\n\nIn summary, we have\nshown that CGMMV has a read-through codon preference and that the read-through\ncodon for TMV was shown to be not efficient, as the chimeric CGMMV transcripts\nutilizing this signal were not infectious. The reported limitation of low-modified\ncoat protein yield of this type of read-through transient expression system\nappears to have been overcome as relatively equal yield of chimeric and wild-type\nCGMMV coat protein were produced. This report also provides a rational\nharvesting timeline for the chimeric virus making this system exploitable for implementation in a\nplantation scale in the future. It can be suggested that once host plants are\ninfected with the chimeric virus carrying the inserted foreign peptides, the\noptimum harvesting time would be at around 14 dpi or not more than 20 dpi in\norder to obtain maximum yield of the full-length transgene. Growth of the\ninfected plants for longer periods to obtain higher yields of the chimeric\nvirus may induce unwanted transgene deletions. This and other factors described\nearlier should be relevant information for the further development of CGMMV or\nother plant viruses as vectors for medically important peptides such as for\ndengue (this study) and Hepatitis B [7] viral antigens."}
