{"title": "Respiratory macrophages regulate CD4 T memory responses to mucosal immunization with recombinant adenovirus-based vaccines", "body": "Mucosal surfaces of respiratory, genital and gastrointestinal tracts are the major gateways of infectious agents, and hence, the development of mucosal vaccines to stimulate protective humoral and/or cellular mucosal immunity has been one of the major focuses of vaccine research for decades [1] [2] [3] . However, the development of mucosal vaccines has proven to be a challenge and only a limited number of mucosal vaccines are licensed in humans [3] . It is widely established that induction of memory responses is the fundamental basis of vaccination and the development of mucosal vaccines against intracellular pathogens that rely on protective memory T cell responses requires greater understanding about molecular and cellular mechanisms in controlling vaccineinduced mucosal T cell responses.\n\nAccording to CCR7 and CD62L (L-selectin) expression, memory CD4 and CD8 T cells are divided into two major subsets, the CCR7 + CD62L high CD44 high CD45RB low central memory T (T CM ) and CCR7 \u00c0 CD62L low CD44 high CD45RB low effector memory T (T EM ) cells [4] . In comparison, naive T cells have the phenotype of CCR7 + CD62L high CD44 low CD45RB high [5, 6] . T CM cells predominantly circulate within secondary lymphoid organs, whereas T EM cells mainly circulate into the peripheral tissues where some http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2016.07.006 0008-8749/\u00d3 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, T CM cells produce low levels of effector molecules such as IFN-c and/or cytotoxic granules, but they have high proliferative capacity and are able to convert to T EM upon antigen restimulation. In contrast, T EM and T RM cells produce immediate effector molecules upon stimulation but have very poor proliferative potential [4, 9] . Compared to T CM cells that are preferentially localized in the systemic lymphoid organs, T EM and T RM cells located at mucosal sites confer immediate frontline immunity against mucosal pathogens [7, 8, 10] . Numerous factors such as the strength and duration of the T cell receptor (TCR) signal, the local inflammatory signals at the time of T cell priming, and other microenvironmental signals associated with the route and/or the immunization schedule all play a role in shaping memory T cell responses in terms of their quality, quantity and anatomic distributions [1, 4, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, most of our understanding has been obtained by studying CD8 memory T cells. CD4 and CD8 memory T cells are different in many aspects; they have different patterns of peripheral migration [12] , different proliferation potential and different longevities [13] . Therefore, additional studies are required to understand the regulation of CD4 T memory responses.\n\nRecombinant adenovirus-based (rAd) vaccines have strong abilities to stimulate CD4 and CD8 T cell responses and have been widely explored for developing vaccines against intracellular pathogens including, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), human immunodeficiency virus, malaria and Chlamydia trachomatis [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Using a rAd-based tuberculosis vaccine, we demonstrated previously that intranasal (i.n.) immunization with rAd induces accumulation of CD4 and CD8 T RM cells in the respiratory tract for a prolonged period of time and confers protection against pulmonary Mtb challenge via both CD4-and CD8-dependent immune mechanisms [15, 20] . In contrast, intramuscular (i.m.) immunization with rAd results in a predominant CD8 T CM cell response in the systemic lymphoid organs, which only translates into a transient partial protection from secondary Mtb challenge in the lung [15, 20] . While these studies highlight the importance of mucosal immunity in mediating vaccine efficacy against mucosal pathogens, the immune mechanisms that control mucosal CD4 memory T cell responses upon i.n. immunization with rAd are still unclear.\n\nAntigen presenting cells (APCs) play key roles in the induction and regulation of pulmonary immune responses. In particular, respiratory macrophages (MUs) are demonstrated to modulate respiratory immune responses via various modes of action [21] [22] [23] . For instance, respiratory MU can modulate immune responses via suppressing migration of dendritic cells (DCs) into the secondary lymphoid organs [21, 22, 24] or by promoting induction of FoxP3 regulatory T cells [25, 26] . Alternatively, respiratory MUs are demonstrated to participate in respiratory immune responses through directly transporting pathogen/antigen into the draining lymph modes (DLNs) [27, 28] . Although respiratory MUs are known to play essential roles during respiratory viral infections [29] [30] [31] , it is unclear whether respiratory MUs may modulate T cell memory responses upon rAd mucosal immunization. In this study, we specifically characterized OVA-specific CD4 T cell responses following i.n. immunization of rAd expressing OVA (AdOVA) and examined the role of respiratory MUs in controlling CD4 memory T cell responses by depleting respiratory MUs using clodronate-containing liposome. Our results indicate that respiratory MU populations have stage-dependent functional roles in shaping CD4 T memory responses. While respiratory MUs limit the early stage of CD4 T cell activation and subsequent size of mucosal memory responses, they are critically required for maintaining long-term CD4 T memory responses at both mucosal and systemic compartments.\n\nSix to eight week-old female BALB/c mice (H-2 d ) were ordered from Charles River Laboratories (Senneville, Quebec, Canada). DO11.10 (H-2 d ) mice were originally from Jackson laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and bred at the IWK Health Centre animal facility. All mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions and used according to the Canadian Council for Animal Care guidelines. Food and water were supplied ad libitum.\n\nThe recombinant human type 5 adenoviral vectors encoding chicken ovalbumin (AdOVA) and empty control vector Addl70-3 have been described before [14, 32] . Viral vectors were amplified, purified and titrated according to the protocols previously described [15] .\n\n2.3. Animal model of DO11.10:BALB/c mice and sample preparations DO11.10:BALB/c mice were used for monitoring OVA-specific CD4 T cell responses. To do this, na\u00efve CD4 + CD62L + T lymphocytes were isolated from pooled peripheral lymph nodes (LN) of DO11.10 mice using mouse na\u00efve CD4 T cell isolation kit (Order No. 130-104-453, Miltenyi Biotec Inc, Auburn, CA, USA) and adoptively transferred into BALB/c mice via tail vein injection ($2 \u00c2 10 6 cells/mouse) 24 h prior to immunization.\n\nTo monitor CD4 T cell proliferation, purified na\u00efve DO11.10 CD4 T cells were first labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dye (Life Science, Oakville, ON, Canada) prior to transfer. Na\u00efve CD4 + CD62L + T cells were resuspended in PBS/0.1% BSA (pre-warmed at 37\u00b0C), mixed with CFSE at final 10 lM concentration and incubated 10 min at 37\u00b0C. Five volumes of ice-cold PBS/10% FBS were used to stop the reaction. Cells were then washed twice with RPMI/5% FBS medium. Twenty-four hours following cell transfer, DO11.10:BALB/c mice were i.n. or i.m. immunized with 5 \u00c2 10 8 or 1 \u00c2 10 9 plaque-forming units (PFU) of AdOVA or empty control virus Addl70-3 as described previously [14, 15, 33] . At days 0, 3, 5 and 7, single cell suspensions were prepared from peripheral LNs including mediastinal (MedLN), inguinal (IngLN) and axillary LN, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and spleen of each mouse, and stained with DO11.10 TCR-specific monoclonal antibody KJ1-26 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). OVA-specific CD4 T cell proliferation was analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\nIn some experiments, cells isolated from BAL, LN, or spleen were seeded in 96-well plates (1 \u00c2 10 6 /well) and restimulated with or without OVA 323-339 peptide (5 lg/mL) for 6, 12, 24 or 48 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . At the end of each time point, culture supernatants were collected and the concentrations of IFN-c, IL-13, IL-17A, TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-10 were analyzed by ELISA. OVAspecific cytokine measurements in Addl-70-3-immunized mice were only detected at the background levels. Samples without OVA 323-339 peptide stimulation had no detectable cytokine production. For the purpose of simplicity, these control groups are not included in data presentation.\n\nTo examine whether respiratory MUs migrate into the MedLN following i.n. immunization with rAd, mice were first instilled with 50 ll of PBS containing 2 mM CFSE via i.n. route and then inoculated with 50 ll of PBS containing AdOVA (1 \u00c2 10 9 PFU/mouse) or PBS alone at 6 h post CFSE delivery. Mice were sacrificed at 40 h post AdOVA immunization and single cell suspensions were prepared from the MedLN and lung tissue of CFSE-labeled mice (CFSE/Ad and CFSE/PBS) and surface labeled with antibodies recognizing MHC II, CD11c, F4/80, and B220 for flow cytometry analyses.\n\nCD11c + cells were purified by MACS MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec Inc) or sorted by flowcytometry from lung, MedLN and IngLN of mice that were pre-immunized with 1 \u00c2 10 9 PFU of AdOVA for 3-5 days. CD11c + DCs were co-cultured with proliferation dye (CFSE or eFluro647)-labeled na\u00efve DO11.10 CD4 + CD62L + T cells (1:5 ratio of DC:CD4) in complete RPMI medium in presence or absence of OVA 323-339 peptide (5 lg/mL) plus IL-2 (10 U/mL) for 3-4 days. In some experiments, CD11c + F4/80 + and CD11c -F4/80 + MUs were sorted from lungs of AdOVA-immunized mice and added to the co-culture at a ratio of 1:5:1 (DC:CD4:MU). CD4 T cells were stained with antibodies recognizing CD44, CD62L, CCR7, CD45RB, and KJ1-26 in different combinations. CD4 T cell proliferation and the activation phenotype in each culture condition were analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\nClodronate-containing liposomes (2 mg clodronate per 20 g body weight) were used to deplete MUs via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection as described before [34] . Empty liposomes were used as controls. To examine the effects of depletion, mononuclear cells were isolated from lung and spleen 3 days post liposome delivery and stained with antibodies recognizing MHCII, CD11c, F4/80, B220 and CD3. To determine the impact of MU depletion on CD4 memory T cell responses, clodronate-containing liposomes or empty liposomes were injected at 3 days prior to AdOVA immunization, or after AdOVA immunization with three consecutive deliveries at days 7, 14 and 21. Mice were sacrificed at day 28 post immunization. OVA-specific memory CD4 T cells were monitored in the BAL and spleen.\n\nThe levels of cytokines in the supernatants were measured by ELISA using antibody pairs specific for mouse IFN-c, IL-13, IL-17A, TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-10 (eBioscience).\n\nTests for statistical significance were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software. The specific analysis is indicated in each figure. P values 60.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nTo study CD4 T cell responses to immunization with rAd, a model vaccine encoding OVA (AdOVA) was used to immunize DO11.10:BALB/c mice via i.m. or i.n. route. The antigen-specific CD4 memory T cell recall responses at 4 weeks postimmunization were examined by stimulating single cell suspensions derived from BAL, lung, or spleen with OVA 323-339 peptides. Notably, AdOVA i.n. immunization induced a mixed Th1 and Th17 immune recall profile in the BAL-and lung-derived cell cultures, but a very low level in the splenocyte cultures. In contrast, i.m. immunization induced a Th1-dominant immune response that was predominantly distributed in the spleen, but very low in the respiratory tract (Fig. 1a) . Furthermore, OVA 323-339 -specific CD4 T cells activated by i.n. but not i.m. immunization also produced high levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-a (Fig. 1a) . Corresponding to the cytokine profile in the BAL, approximately 25% of BAL cells from i.n. immunized mice were OVA-specific DO11.10 cells. In comparison, only $1.5% of total BAL cells from i.m. immunized mice were OVA-specific DO11.10 cells and the total number of DO11.10 cells in the BAL of i.m. immunized mice was significantly reduced compared to i.n. immunized mice (Fig. 1b) . Of interest, the frequencies of DO11.10 cells in the spleen of i.n. and i.m. immunized mice were comparable despite a significantly different cytokine profile in splenocyte cultures (Fig. 1a/c) . These results are consistent with our previous studies using rAd vaccines encoding bacterial antigens [14, 15] , indicating a common phenomenon for rAd-based vaccination that different routes of immunization with rAd stimulate CD4 memory T cell responses with different quantity, quality and differential anatomic distributions.\n\nCharacterization of CD4 T cell proliferation and dissemination in the local draining lymph nodes and spleen following i.n. and i.m. immunization Memory CD4 T cells are very heterogeneous and generated through divergent pathways from antigen-activated precursors [35] [36] [37] . The fate of T cells becoming stable memory T cells may be determined during the first division of T cell activation [35, 38] . In order to understand how different routes of immunization lead to different CD4 memory T cell responses, we examined CD4 T cell proliferation, an early event of T cell activation, in the lymphoid organs of i.n. and i.m. immunized mice. Based on the characteristic CFSE dilution profile, a clear DO11.10 CD4 T cell proliferation profile in the DLNs (in the MedLN of i.n. immunized mice and in IngLN of i.m. immunized mice) was evident at days 3 and 5 post immunization (Fig. 2) . Notably, CD4 T cell proliferation kinetics induced by i.n. and i.m. immunization differed drastically at day 3 post immunization (see overlay). The frequencies of nonproliferating OVA-specific CD4 T cells in the IngLN and MedLN were $10% and $30%, respectively. Correspondingly, more DO11.10 CD4 T cells progressed to later cell cycles (cycle 4 and 5) in the IngLN of the i.m. group than that in the MedLN of i.n. immunized mice (Fig. 2a) . However, the difference in proliferation kinetics appeared to be reduced by day 5 (Fig. 2b) . As expected, no characteristic CD4 T cell proliferation was observed in the nondraining axillary LN or spleen in any immunization group at both time points. Instead, DO11.10 cells in the axillary LN and spleen exhibited distinct CFSE intensities that were indicative of either non-proliferating cells (the initial transferred DO11.10 T cells) or highly divided T cells (the disseminated DO11.10 cells from the DLNs) ( Fig. 2a/b ). Associated with the T cell proliferation kinetics in the DLNs, we observed a slow dissemination of activated CD4 T cells in the non-draining axillary LN and spleen of i.n. immunized mice compared to i.m. immunized mice. For instance, the frequencies of disseminated DO11.10 cells in the spleen of i.n. and i.m. immunized mice were 0.29% and 0.81%, respectively, at day 5 post immunization ( Fig. 2a/b) . Similarly, the frequencies of disseminated DO11.10 cells in the axillary LN were 0.32% (i.n.) versus 1.4% (i.m.) at day 5 post immunization ( Fig. 2a/b ). The frequencies of disseminated DO11.10 cells in the axillary LN and spleen of i.n. and i.m. immunized mice were comparable by day 7 post immunization (data not shown).\n\nIn order to examine whether the potential differences in antigen uptake during i.n. and i.m. immunization contribute to differential CD4 T cell proliferation kinetics, two doses of AdOVA were included in our comparison. While a dose-dependent KJ1-26 + T cell expansion was observed in the MedLN following i.n. immunization of AdOVA, the dose-dependent reaction was not observed in the IngLN of i.m. immunized mice (Fig. 3a/b) , which may attribute to the concurrent events of CD4 T cell proliferation and active T cell emigration. In comparison, the number of KJ1-26 + T cells in the spleen displayed a clear trend of dosedependent responses in both i.n. and i.m. immunized mice. Consistent with the proliferation profile, the overall levels of KJ1-26 + T cell expansion in the spleen of i.n. immunized mice were lower compared to i.m. immunized mice at both doses (Fig. 3c) , suggesting that the model of antigen uptake in i.n. and i.m. immunization has a role in regulating CD4 T cell responses. Remarkably, the kinetics of OVA 323-339 -specific IFN-c response in the splenocyte cultures was characteristically affected by the route of immunization (Fig. 3d) . OVA peptide stimulated a rapid IFN-c response, a typical T EM response , in i.m. immunized mice which was readily detected as early as 6 h and peaked at 12-24 h post stimulation.\n\nIn contrast, the IFN-c response in i.n. immunized mice was not detectable until 48 h post stimulation. Notably, an increased dose of AdOVA in both i.n. and i.m. immunization groups only affected the level, but not the kinetics, of IFN-c recall responses (Fig. 3d) , demonstrating that other factors, in addition to the model of antigen uptake, also play a role in controlling the CD4 T cell responses. Together, our results demonstrate that the impact of route of immunization on CD4 T cell responses starts at the very beginning of the immune induction phase via controlling CD4 T cell proliferation in the local DLNs. Not only does the distinct T cell prolifera-tion kinetics result in different numbers of activated CD4 T cells, but also it affects the quality of activated CD4 T cells.\n\nSince APCs play an instrumental role in CD4 T cell activation, we then questioned whether distinct OVA-specific CD4 T cell responses induced by i.n. or i.m. immunization were controlled by distinct APC populations. To this end, mice were first immunized with AdOVA to prime APC populations in vivo. Lung APCs and MedLN APCs were purified from AdOVA i.n. immunized mice and IngLN APCs were isolated from AdOVA i.m. immunized mice using anti-CD11c-conjugated MACS beads. Purified CD11c + cells were used to stimulate OVA-specific CD4 T cells ex vivo. Notably, a significantly reduced T cell proliferation was observed in the lung APC-containing cultures compared to those with APCs from MedLN and IngLN (Fig. 4a/b) . In parallel with a slower proliferation kinetics, more CD4 T cells activated by lung-derived APCs displayed higher levels of CCR7 compared to CD4 T cells activated by LN-derived APCs. In comparison, CD4 T cells in all culture conditions displayed comparable levels of CD44 (Fig. 4b) . These results suggest that CD4 T cells activated by lung-derived APCs and LN-derived APCs may have an increased tendency to develop into CCR7 + T CM and CCR7 -T EM CD4 T cells, respectively.\n\nA portion of respiratory MU also express CD11c [39] and represent a fraction of CD11c + cells in lung-derived APCs. Since respiratory MU are reported to have immune suppressive activity under various conditions [40, 41] , the difference between lung-derived expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 3) and the differences between groups were analyzed using two-way ANOVA test. $$ p < 0.01 between indicated groups, \u2044 p < 0.05, \u2044\u2044 p < 0.01 compared to na\u00efve mice.\n\nAPCs and LN-derived APCs (MedLN and IngLN) on CD4 T cell activation kinetics might be due to a decreased number of DCs in lung-derived APCs and the contaminated respiratory MU may suppress CD4 T cell activation. Since Alveolar MU(AM), interstitial MU (IM) and respiratory DCs are distinguishable based on characteristic F4/80 and CD11c expression [24] , we repeated co-cultured experiments by using pure CD11c + DCs that were sorted from the lung and LNs of AdOVA-immunized mice by FACS. As demonstrated in Fig. 4c , sorted-CD11c + DCs from lung and MedLN as well as IngLN stimulated CD4 T cell proliferation at comparable rates although lung DCs remained to be somewhat weaker compared to LN-derived DCs (Fig. 4c/e) . CD11c + F4/80 + AMs and CD11c -F4/80 + IMs were also sorted from the lungs of AdOVA-immunized mice. Adding purified CD11c + F4/80 + AMs significantly reduced CD4 T cell proliferation in all co-cultures (Fig. 4d/e) . CD11c -F4/80 + IMs also showed inhibitory effect on CD4 T cell proliferation in lung-DC cultures although they appeared to be less inhibitory (Fig. 4e) . Notably, alveolar MU isolated from na\u00efve mice had even stronger inhibitory effect (data not shown). Together, our data suggest that respiratory MU are capable of limiting CD4 T cell activation and proliferation.\n\nSubsequently, we examined whether respiratory MU actually migrate into the DLN and regulate CD4 T cell responses in vivo.\n\nTo this end, we instilled CFSE to the airway to label the respiratory cells 6 h prior to AdOVA i.n. immunization and analyzed the frequency and phenotype of CFSE-positive MU in the DLN and lung by flow cytometry at 40 h post immunization. As shown in Fig. 5 , the vast majority of CFSE + migrating cells in mice treated with CFSE/PBS were CD3 + and B220 + , indicating a homeostatic migration of T cells and B cells from the airway to the DLN. Remarkably, AdOVA immunization significantly increased the frequency and total number of CFSE + DCs (MHCII + CD11c + ) and MU (MHCII + CD11c + F4/80 + ) in the DLNs compared to the CFSE/PBS control group (Fig. 5a/b ). Corresponding to the changes in the DLN, AdOVA immunization significantly increased the frequency and number of AMs and DCs in the lung (Fig. 5c/d) . These results indicate that AdOVA i.n. immunization induces concurrent migration and/or expansion of respiratory DCs and MU populations in the DLNs and lung parenchyma. Notably, AMs in Ad-immunized mice displayed an increased frequency of MHC II-positive (45% in CFSE/ Ad group versus 28% in CFSE/PBS group). In addition, the F4/80 + cells observed in the lung of AdOVA-immunized mice were predominantly CFSE-negative and CD11c + (Fig. 5b) , indicating that accumulation of AMs in Ad-immunized mice is largely due to the recruitment of circulating monocyte-derived MU. Together, our results demonstrate a dynamic involvement of respiratory MU populations upon i.n. vaccination with rAd.\n\nIn order to understand the biological role of respiratory MU in regulating CD4 T cell responses in vivo, we utilized clodronatecontaining liposomes to deplete MU in vivo [42] . The impact of liposome delivery on F4/80 + macrophages, CD11c + DCs and other CD11b + myeloid cells in the spleen and lung was first determined by flow cytometry. Remarkably, the frequency of F4/80-positive macrophages in the spleen was markedly reduced from $13% in PBS-treated or control liposome-treated mice to $3% in clodronatecontaining liposome-treated mice ( Fig. 6a/b ). Consistent with a previous report [34] , i.p. injection of clodronate-containing liposome also significantly depleted respiratory macrophages (both CD11c -IMs and CD11c + AMs) (Fig. 6c/d) . In sharp contrast to a potent depletion effect on macrophages, no significant depletion was observed on F4/80 -/CD11c + pulmonary DCs in the lung (Fig. 6c/d) .\n\nWe subsequently conducted experiments using clodronatecontaining liposomes or control liposomes in early or late depletion regimens in which liposomes were given 3 days prior to immunization or after immunization, respectively (Fig. 7a/d/e) . Notably, MU depletion prior to immunization completely eliminated the differences in i.n. and i.m. immunized mice at the CD4 T cell activation phase (Fig. 7a/b/c) . The T cell proliferation kinetics in the draining LNs (Fig. 7b) and OVA peptide-induced IFN-c responses in splenocyte cultures (Fig. 7c) became indistinguishable among i.n. and i.m. immunized mice upon MU depletion, highlighting a role of macrophages in suppressing CD4 T cell activation. We also examined the frequency of CD4 + CD44 high CD45RB low memory T cells in the BAL and spleen of early depleted versus nondepleted mice at 4 weeks post immunization. As demonstrated in Fig. 7f /g, MU-depletion prior to immunization significantly increased the number of CD4 memory T cells in the BAL compared to the control liposome-treated mice. No apparent impact on memory T cells in the spleen was observed. In sharp contrast to the early depletion regimen, MU-depletion following AdOVA i.n. immunization resulted in a markedly reduced frequency and number of DO11.10 CD4 memory T cells in the BAL and spleen (Fig. 7f/g) , demonstrating a functional role of respiratory MU for maintaining long-term CD4 memory T cell responses.\n\nIn this study, the immune mechanisms in controlling CD4 T cell responses to mucosal immunization with rAd-based vaccines were investigated. By characterizing early events of CD4 T cell activation following i.n. and i.m. immunization, we have demonstrated that the differential CD4 T cell responses associated with the route of immunization are controlled by multiple factors including the model of antigen uptake and the intrinsic properties of APCs. By tracking respiratory macrophages upon i.n. immunization, we have revealed a dynamic process of respiratory macrophages induced by mucosal immunization and demonstrated that respiratory MU and circulating monocytes migrate into the local draining LNs and accumulate in the lung parenchyma. By depleting macrophages using clodronate-containing liposomes, we have further demonstrated divergent roles for respiratory MU populations in controlling CD4 T memory responses to rAd immunization in a stage-dependent manner. While respiratory MU populations act as a negative regulator to limit the early stage of CD4 T cell activation and proliferation and the quality of T cells, they are critically required for maintaining long-term memory T cells, both the tissue-resident and systemic memory CD4 T cells.\n\nAs the most abundant professional phagocytes in the airway, MUs play a predominant role for capturing soluble antigens and cellular debris under steady conditions and microorganisms upon respiratory infections [43, 44] . However, pulmonary MU function poorly as professional APCs but possess immune suppressive activities to dampen the induction of adaptive immune response [21, 23, 25, 26, 40, 43] . Under resting conditions, MU-mediated immune suppression is essential in maintaining respiratory homeostasis and for preventing the induction of aberrant immune responses against inert antigens and environmental particles [43] . Upon respiratory infections, production of pro-inflammatory mediators is required for orchestrating innate immune cells such as DCs to counteract the inhibitory effect of pulmonary MUs. It has been demonstrated that MU-mediated immune suppression accounts for poor T cell responses and severe disease in mice during respiratory coronavirus infection [31] . Depletion of MU in vivo with liposome delivery results in a significant increase in pulmonary CD4 and CD8 T cell responses against influenza and coronavirus infections [30, 31] . Consistent with these reports, we have also observed immune suppressive activity of pulmonary MU in controlling the induction of CD4 T cell response and subsequent CD4 memory response during rAd i.n. immunization. Respiratory MU may simply suppress induction of T cell responses via producing soluble molecules like prostaglandins, TGF-b and IL-10 [41, 45] .\n\nIn sharp contrast to a negative role of MU over CD4 T cell responses upon i.n. immunization with rAd, MU-depletion after immunization markedly reduced the frequencies of CD4 memory T cells in the BAL and spleen (Fig. 7f/g) . Therefore, our study has extended our understanding for a role of respiratory MU popula-tions in maintaining long-term memory CD4 T cells. At the moment, the molecular mechanisms underlying the observation remain unclear. Recent fate-mapping studies indicate that the tissue-resident MU population is derived from the yolk sac and fetal liver during development [46, 47] , and mixed with monocyte-derived MUs recruited from the bone marrow after tissue injury and infection [48] . While the yolk-sac-derived MU population is capable of self-renewing in the steady state, its role in lung infection/immunization remains unclear. In our system, massive expansion of pulmonary MU population after rAd immunization was observed (Fig. 5c/d) . Although the vast majority of pulmonary MU population appeared to be recruited from circulating monocytes, we cannot rule of the possibility that a portion of them are proliferating yolk-sac-derived MU population. In addition, there might be an enhanced secondary monocyte recruitment in the lung following repeated clodronate-containing liposome delivery (Sup. Fig. 1 ). These monocytes are likely mobilized from the spleen as a result of heightened inflammatory responses in the lung [49] . However, investigating the precise role of these monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages and different pulmonary MU populations in maintaining long-term CD4 memory T cells requires a more sophisticated system. Nevertheless, it has been suggested in a recent study that immune regulatory macrophages differentiated from monocytes by M-CSF and IL-34 are able to switch non-committed human CD4 memory T cells into Th17 cells [50] . Conversely, the pro-inflammatory macrophages induced by GM-CSF promote Th1 cells [50] . Furthermore, a recent study using intra-vaginal immunization with an attenuated herpes simplex virus 2 demonstrates that tissue resident CD4 memory T cells are maintained by chemokines, particularly CCL5, secreted by local macrophages [51] . Therefore, the accumulation of respiratory T EM CD4 T cells in i.n immunized mice is unlikely only controlled at the initial phase of CD4 T cell activation in the DLNs. Rather, we believe that the initial T EM CD4 T cells disseminated from the DLNs may have undergone additional expansion, modification and fitness within the respiratory microenvironment and this process is largely dependent on the presence of respiratory MU populations and the soluble mediators released by MU. Long-term memory CD8 T cells in the airway lumen by mucosal immunization with rAd undergo antigen-driven proliferation in situ [52] . Therefore, respiratory MU may maintain CD4 memory T cells via presenting antigen to activated CD4 T cells at the immunization site. Viral-infected alveolar MU are known to undergo apoptosis in order to control intracellular viral infection [34, 45] . Potentially, those apoptotic MU and cellular debris are taken up by neighboring/recruiting MU for maintaining normal respiratory function [29, 34, 45] . Under this condition, alveolar MU may acquire viral antigens through active internalization of viral-infected dying alveolar MU and present antigen to activated CD4 T cells in the airway lumen for a prolonged period of time. Further investigations are needed to delineate the involvement of respiratory MU in protecting tissue-resident CD4 memory T cells.\n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that respiratory MU populations have dual functional roles in controlling the quality and quantity of CD4 T cell responses at both immune induction and memory phases. Improved mucosal vaccination strategies aiming at enhancing long-term CD4 T cell responses for intracellular pathogens at mucosal surfaces may be developed by modulating respiratory MUs.\n\nEAR performed the experiments and data analyses and drafted the manuscript.

CD4 memory T cells in BAL and spleen were determined by FACS at 4 weeks post immunization. The percentage and the number of DO11.10 CD4 memory T cells (CD44 high CD45RB low ) are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM of 5-8 mice per group pooled from two experiments. The differences between groups were analyzed using two-way ANOVA test ( \u2044 p < 0.05, \u2044\u2044 p < 0.01, \u2044\u2044\u2044 p < 0.001)."}
