{"title": "Structure and Dynamics of the HIV-1 Frameshift\nElement RNA", "body": "HIV-1 virion particles were\nprepared as described.23 Briefly, HIV-1\nNL4-3 (group M, subtype B) derived by the transfection of 293T cells\nwith pNL4-3 (obtained through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program, Division\nof AIDS, NIAID, NIH: pNL4-3 from Dr. Malcolm Martin24) was used to infect cells from a non-Hodgkin\u2019s T\ncell lymphoma line (SupT1-CCR5).25 Purified\nHIV-1 preparations (1000\u00d7 concentrates) were stored frozen at\n\u221280 \u00b0C until used.\n\nVirions were treated as described,26 with the exception that the 1M7 SHAPE reagent\nwas used in place of NMIA. Briefly, virions treated with 1M7 or unmodified\nvirions were digested with subtilisin and centrifuged through a 20%\n(w/v) sucrose cushion prior to the extraction of genomes.27 Virions were then lysed by incubation in virion\nlysis buffer [50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl,\n10 mM DTT, 15 \u03bcL 20 mg/mL proteinase K] (using 100 \u03bcL\nlysing buffer per 1 mL volume of 1000\u00d7 HIV-1 culture supernatant\nconcentrate) for 30 min at room temperature. The digest was extracted\nfour times with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, followed by four\nextractions with pure chloroform. The aqueous layer was brought to\na NaCl concentration of 300 mM, nucleic acids were precipitated with\n70% ethanol, and samples were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C. Pelleted\nRNA was resuspended in storage buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8) at a final\nRNA concentration of 400 nM. These aliquots were flash frozen in liquid\nN2 and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.\n\nFor each reaction,\n1 \u03bcL of 400 nM ex virio RNA (prepared as described\nabove, without in virio RNA chemical modification)\nwas dissolved in a Mg2+-containing standard folding buffer\n[50 mM HEPES (pH 8), 200 mM potassium acetate (pH 8), and 3 mM MgCl2] to promote the formation of native-like interactions (total\nvolume was 20 \u03bcL). This mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C\nfor 30 min before SHAPE modification.\n\nFor the formamide denaturation\nexperiments, 1 \u03bcL of 400 nM ex virio RNA was\nresuspended in 5 \u03bcL of folding buffer and incubated at 37 \u00b0C\nfor 20 min. A formamide-containing folding buffer [67% (v/v) deionized\nformamide, 50 mM HEPES (pH 8), 200 mM potassium acetate (pH 8), and\n3 mM MgCl2] was then combined with the appropriate amount\nof standard folding buffer and added to the reaction mix to obtain\nthe desired formamide concentration in a reaction volume of 20 \u03bcL.\nExperiments were performed at final formamide concentrations of 0%\nto 60%, in increments of 10%. The RNA was incubated in formamide for\n20 min at 37 \u00b0C prior to SHAPE modification.\n\nWe used 9- and 10-nt LNA\noligonucleotides (Exiqon) that were the reverse complements of HIV-1\nsequences comprising helices proposed in the SHAPE-directed frameshift\nmodel. The sequences were chosen to avoid self-complementarity and\nto avoid stretches of three or more G or C nucleotides. When possible,\nwe included flanking single-stranded regions as part of the targeted\nstrand to facilitate LNA binding to structured helices. LNA oligonucleotide\nbinding positions (in parentheses) refer to the NL4-3 genome (based\non GenBank accession number AF324493, starting at the beginning of\nthe 5\u2032 R-region, nucleotide 455), and the sequences are 1 (1604\u20131612), CAATCTTTC; 2 (1629\u20131638), CTAAAAAATT; 3 (1588\u20131596), GTCCTTCCT; 4 (1678\u20131686), TCTGAAGAA; 5 (1570\u20131578), TCCAACAGC; and 6 (1697\u20131705), GCTGTTGGC. LNA nucleotides are underlined; all others are DNA. Their corresponding\nbinding sites are shown in Figure 1.\n\nFor each LNA binding experiment,\n1 \u03bcL of 400 nM extracted HIV-1 genomic RNA in storage buffer\n[50 mM HEPES (pH 8) and 200 mM potassium acetate], 2 \u03bcL of 2\n\u03bcM LNA, 4.6 \u03bcL of TE, and 1.7 \u03bcL of water were mixed\nand heated at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min and then snap cooled on ice. A\n9.5 \u03bcL aliquot of 2\u00d7 storage buffer and 1.2 \u03bcL of\n50 mM MgCl2 (20 \u03bcL total in folding buffer conditions)\nwere added and the solution incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C before\nthe SHAPE modification step.\n\nSHAPE modification was performed\nby adding 9 \u03bcL each of RNA sample to 1 \u03bcL of 40 mM SHAPE\nreagent (1M7 for standard SHAPE reactions and 1M6 and NMIA for differential\nSHAPE reactions) or 1 \u03bcL of neat DMSO as a no-reagent control.\nThe samples were incubated for 4 min at 37 \u00b0C. We then added\n1 \u03bcL of 50 mM EDTA and performed a cleanup step to remove LNA\noligonucleotides if necessary (RNeasy Mini Kit; Qiagen). The resulting\nmixture (100 \u03bcL) was precipitated with 10 \u03bcL of 2 M NaCl\nand 300 \u03bcL of ethanol and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until\nprimer extension.\n\nPellets containing SHAPE-modified or control\nRNA were resuspended in 7 \u03bcL of 0.5\u00d7 TE and 6 \u03bcL\nof 0.4 \u03bcM VIC-labeled DNA primer (Applied Biosciences). Primer\nextension reactions for LNA binding experiments were performed using\nDNA primers complementary to RNA genome nucleotide positions (see\nabove) 1750\u20131771 (primer 6.2, with sequence ATC GGC TCC TGC\nTTC TGA GAG G) and 2033\u20132054 (primer 7, with sequence CAA TTA\nTGT TGA CAG GTG TAG G). We used primer 6.2 for formamide denaturation\nexperiments and primer 7 for in virio experiments.\nPrimer extension reactions were performed as described.28,29\n\nRaw capillary electropherograms were\nprocessed using QuShape.28 Briefly, key\nprocessing steps include a mobility shift to correct for small differences\nin the electrophoretic mobility between the NED and VIC fluorescent\ndyes and a signal decay correction to account for signal attenuation\nas the distance from the reverse transcriptase primer binding site\nincreases. DMSO control peaks were subtracted from reagent peaks,\nand the resulting SHAPE reactivities were normalized on a scale where\na normalized reactivity of 1.0 was defined as the average intensity\nof the top 10% most reactive peaks, excluding a few highly reactive\nnucleotides taken to be outliers. The resulting reactivities span\na scale from 0 to \u223c1.5, where 0 indicates no reactivity (and\na highly constrained nucleotide) and reactivities >0.7 typically\nindicate\nhighly flexible nucleotides.\n\nSHAPE-directed\nmodels\nfor the frameshift domain were created by incorporating SHAPE data\ninto the RNAstructure folding algorithm.17,18 For HIV, we used values of m = 3.0 kcal/mol and b = \u22120.6 kcal/mol. To account for LNA binding, the\nLNA target site was forced to be single stranded by imposing artificial\nSHAPE reactivity values of 100. For LNA 5 and 6, which target the\nhighly stable anchoring helix, base pairing was also prohibited at\npartner nucleotides as the observed reactivity increases were taken\nto imply a single stranded state.\n\nComplementary synthetic oligonucleotides\n(IDT) with BamH I and Sac I compatible ends were phosphorylated, annealed,\nand ligated into the p2luc vector using the BamH I and Sac I sites\nbetween the rluc and fluc reporter genes.22 Plasmid DNA was purified from cell cultures (Qiagen), and the sequences\nof all constructs were verified by sequencing.\n\nRNAs for the frameshift\nassay were transcribed in vitro from p2luc plasmid\nDNA linearized with PmlI, purified His6-tagged\nT7 RNA polymerase (10\u00d7), 11.25 mM NTPs, and 2 units of RNase\ninhibitor (RNasin Plus; Promega, N2615) in 200 \u03bcL for 2 h at\n37 \u00b0C. Pyrophosphate was pelleted by centrifugation (10 min,\n13,200 rpm), and RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform. Unincorporated\nNTPs and salt were separated from the RNA by gel filtration (Ilustra\nMicroSpin G-25 Columns; GE Healthcare). RNAs were heated at 95 \u00b0C\nfor 5 min followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. Samples were lyophilized\nto dryness and resuspended in water at 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcL. RNA integrity\nand purity were confirmed with 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\nIn vitro frameshift assays were completed with each\nRNA reporter using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL System; Promega,\nnuclease treated, L416A). Translation reactions contained 0.63 \u03bcg\nof RNA, 10 units of RNase inhibitor, and 8.8 \u03bcL of RRL in 12.5\n\u03bcL. Following a 90 min incubation at 37 \u00b0C, reactions were\nquenched by the addition of EDTA (pH 8.0) to a final concentration\nof 6 mM. For each reporter, a minimum of three independent frameshift\nassays were completed using different preparations of mRNA (full biological\nreplicates). Independent biological replicate assays included four\nreplicate reactions. Luminescence was measured using the dual-luciferase\nreporter assay (Promega). Readings were taken with a microplate luminometer\n(Veritas) equipped with dual-injectors (Turner Biosystems) for 10\ns after 25 \u03bcL of the respective substrate was injected into\nthe reaction mixture (2 s lag time prior to measurement). Each experiment\nincluded an in-frame positive control22 with a mutated \u201cnon-slippery sequence\u201d and an additional\nnucleotide inserted immediately before the Sac I site, which places\nthe rluc and fluc genes in-frame. Frameshift efficiencies were calculated\nby taking the ratio of the experimental to control luminescence (firefly\nto Renilla). Small variations in the activities of\ncontrol reactions were observed with different preparations of mRNA\nand reticulocyte lysates. To account for these differences, frameshift\nefficiencies were normalized relative to wild-type levels, and averaged.\nThe non-normalized frameshift efficiencies for the native sequence\nconstruct in all biological replicates (n = 9) was\n5.4 \u00b1 0.9%. Standard deviations were propagated to yield a standard\nerror of the mean (SEM).\n\nWe initially attempted to bind antisense LNAs to folded\nfull-length genomic RNA extracted from HIV-1 virions. However, addition\nof LNAs directed against the anchoring helix failed to produce detectable\nSHAPE reactivity changes in the predicted partner strand. This result\ncould reflect either that the targeted helix was too stable to be\ndisrupted by LNA binding or that our model in the frameshift region\nwas inaccurate. When we heated the HIV-1 RNA at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min\nin the presence of LNA and snap cooled on ice prior to incubation\nin folding buffer, we found that SHAPE reactivities did increase in\nthe predicted partner strand upon addition of LNA, indicative of a\nvery stable target helix.\n\nFor the results obtained upon heat\ndenaturation and LNA binding in the frameshift element region to provide\nclear biological insights, the conformation adopted after heat denaturation\nmust be native-like. We performed SHAPE on HIV-1 RNA gently extracted\nfrom virions and on a sample of this same RNA following heat denaturation\nand refolding. The standard SHAPE reagent 1M730 and two additional SHAPE probing reagents, 1M6 and NMIA, were used\nin these analyses. 1M6 and NMIA are sensitive to different local structural\nstates and time scales and consequently provide a detailed structural\nfingerprint for an RNA.31,32 SHAPE reactivities\nfor the genome region near the frameshift element were highly similar\nin both ex virio and in heated-refolded RNAs for\nall three reagents (r = 0.94\u20130.96, Supporting Information, Figure 1). We conclude\nthat the refolded frameshift domain adopts essentially the same conformation\nas the ex virio HIV-1 RNA purified under nondenaturing\nconditions.\n\nWe designed 9- and 10-nt LNA oligonucleotides to\nbind to each of\nthe strands of the three major helices unique to the SHAPE-directed\nframeshift model (Figure 1). If the targeted\nhelix existed and if LNA binding disrupted native base pairing, we\nexpected to observe increased SHAPE reactivity at the strand complementary\nto the LNA-bound strand. In all six cases, SHAPE reactivity increased\nfor at least some nucleotides in the predicted partner strand (Figure 2, gray boxes). These results strongly support the\nformation of the slippery sequence (Figure 2A,B) and alternate lower (Figure 2C,D) and\nanchoring helices (Figure 2E,F) in the full-length\nHIV-1 RNA.\n\nAlthough reactivity increases\nwere consistently observed at the predicted\npartner strand upon LNA binding, most LNAs also induced additional\nSHAPE reactivity changes. For example, LNA 1 was designed to disrupt\nthe slippery sequence helix. In addition to the expected increases\nin SHAPE reactivity at the partner strand (Figure 2A, gray boxes), LNA 1 binding also induced SHAPE reactivity\nincreases at nucleotides 1585\u20131590 and decreases at nucleotides\n1641\u20131644. Nucleotides 1585\u20131590 are predicted to be\nsingle stranded in the SHAPE-directed frameshift model, while nucleotides\n1641\u20131644 are predicted to form part of the alternate lower\nstem. The changes in SHAPE reactivity upon LNA binding suggest the\nformation of base-pairing interactions that correspond to the lower\nstem from the conventional two-helix model (Figure 2A, red boxes). Binding to the complementary side of the helix\nby LNA 2 did not result in this conformational switch (Figure 2B). LNA 2 targets nucleotides in close proximity\nto, and possibly overlapping with, the conventional lower stem. In\nthis case, steric occlusion due to LNA 2 binding likely disfavors\nformation of the conventional lower stem.\n\nLNA 3 was designed\nto disrupt the alternate lower stem. LNA 3 induced relatively minor\nincreases in reactivity in the partner strand (Figure 2C, gray box) and more pronounced changes in reactivity in\nother regions (Figure 2C, red and yellow boxes).\nFor example, reactivity at nucleotides 1641\u20131643 was reduced\nrelative to the reactivity in the no-LNA control, consistent with\nthe formation of the conventional lower stem. LNA 4 was also designed\nto disrupt the alternate lower stem, and its binding resulted in the\nexpected reactivity increases at the predicted partner strand but\nno significant changes elsewhere. We attribute this lack of a conformational\nswitch to the fact that LNA 4 binding would prevent the formation\nof both the alternate and conventional conformations of the lower\nstem.\n\nBinding by LNA 5 or LNA 6 also resulted in SHAPE reactivity\nincreases\nin the corresponding partner strands (Figure 2E,F) and in changes similar to those observed upon LNA 1 binding\nto the slippery sequence helix and LNA 3 binding to the alternate\nlower stem. SHAPE reactivities decreased for nucleotides 1641\u20131643\nand increased for nucleotides 1590\u20131595, consistent with a\ntransition from the alternate lower stem to the conventional lower\nstem. These results suggest that the anchoring helix stabilizes the\nalternate lower stem.\n\nBinding by LNAs 3, 5, and 6 all induced a\nswitch in RNA conformation from the alternate lower stem to the conventional\nlower stem (Figure 2C,E,F, red boxes). Binding\nby these LNAs also resulted in increased SHAPE reactivity at the slippery\nsequence helix (Figure 2C,E,F, yellow boxes).\nRemarkably, these changes even occurred upon disruption of the relatively\ndistant anchoring helix by LNAs 5 and 6. In contrast, LNA 4, which\ndestabilized the alternate lower stem but did not induce the formation\nof the conventional lower stem, did not cause significant SHAPE reactivity\nchanges in the slippery sequence helix (Figure 2D). These results suggest that the alternate lower stem and slippery\nsequence stabilize one another and are structurally coupled.\n\nWe next\nexamined the relative stabilities of the four main helices\npresent in the SHAPE-directed frameshift element. Formamide denatures\nnucleic acid structure.33 Therefore, we\nincubated HIV-1 RNA in buffer containing a range (0\u201360% vol/vol)\nof formamide concentrations with the expectation that global reactivity\nto 1M7 would increase with denaturant concentration. Following a 20\nmin incubation at 37 \u00b0C in folding buffer, we added formamide\nand incubated the solution for a further 20 min before initiating\nSHAPE probing with 1M7.\n\nAt 20% formamide, nucleotides involved\nin the slippery sequence helix showed increased SHAPE reactivity relative\nto the buffer without formamide (Figure 3A,B).\nNucleotides involved in the alternate lower stem exhibited reactivity\nchanges that suggest a switch to the conventional lower stem at 20%\nformamide (Figure 3B and Supporting Information, Figure 2). In 40% formamide, SHAPE\nreactivities indicated that the conventional lower stem was unfolded\n(Figure 3C). Nearest neighbor thermodynamic\ncalculations indicate that the conventional lower stem is slightly\nmore stable than the SHAPE-directed alternate lower stem (\u22128.4\nkcal/mol and \u22128.2 kcal/mol, respectively). We hypothesize that\nthe formation of the alternate lower stem is largely dependent on\nstabilization from other elements in the domain and that, when these\ninteractions are disrupted by LNA binding or by formamide denaturation,\nthe slightly more stable conventional lower stem is able to form.\n\nThe anchoring helix and upper stem show very low SHAPE reactivities\nup to 40% formamide. Nucleotides in the anchoring helix became reactive\nonly at 60% formamide, and nucleotides in the upper stem remained\nunreactive even at this high denaturant concentration (Figure 3D). The high stability of the upper stem was noted\npreviously.34 We conclude from these experiments\nthat the frameshift domain is bounded by two highly stable helices\nand that the intervening less stable helices have the propensity to\nunfold upon perturbation and, in the case of the lower stem, refold\ninto alternative conformations.\n\nWe next probed the frameshift region\nof HIV-1 RNA as it exists packaged inside virions using the well-validated\n1M7 SHAPE reagent. Structural interrogation of the in virio state is possible because SHAPE reagents readily cross biological\nmembranes.35,36 SHAPE probing indicated that\nthe frameshift domain of RNA packaged within the virion adopted a\nmuch less structured conformation than that adopted by either gently\ndeproteinized genomic (ex virio) or refolded RNA\n(Figure 4). Nucleotides involved in the slippery\nsequence helix and lower stem, including both the conventional and\nalternate base-pairings, displayed higher SHAPE reactivities in virio than in isolated RNA. These differences could reflect\nRNA refolding or protein binding in the in virio environment.\nIn contrast, SHAPE reactivities for the anchoring helix and upper\nstem remained low, suggesting that these elements folded stably inside\nvirions.\n\nWhile the LNA binding experiments confirmed\nthe existence of all helices unique to the SHAPE-directed model, the\nformamide denaturation and in virio experiments showed\nthat some of these helices are relatively unstable. To determine the\nbiological importance of each of these helices, we examined a set\nof mutants designed to disrupt individual predicted helices and evaluated\nframeshifting efficiency in a dual luciferase reporter assay.22 Using this system, we were unable to detect\nany significant effect on frameshifting upon disruption of either\nthe anchoring helix (Figure 5, mutants 1 and\n2) or the conventional lower stem (Figure 5, mutant 3). However, when the alternate lower stem was disrupted,\na significant decrease in frameshifting was observed (Figure 5, mutant 4). We conclude that native-like frameshifting\nlevels are dependent on the formation of the alternate, but not necessarily\nthe conventional, lower stem. These results suggest that the alternate\nlower stem is a potential therapeutic target.\n\nA very different result was obtained\nwhen the anchoring helix,\nalternate lower stem, and slippery site helix were simultaneously\ndisrupted by mutagenesis (Figure 5, mutant\n5). In this case, frameshifting increased to greater than native-like\nlevels. These results agree with a prior report that frameshifting\nefficiency of a construct containing only the upper stem and conventional\nlower stem is approximately twice that of a construct that contains\nthe entire SHAPE-predicted domain.22 Together,\nthese data are consistent with a translational pausing mechanism whereby\nstructured regions preceding the frameshift site regulate ribosome\nspacing.37 That these results differ from\nthose obtained when the anchoring helix and alternate lower stem were\nmutated independently supports our hypotheses that there is strong\nstructural coupling between these elements and that these helices\nhave overlapping functional roles in modulating frameshifting efficiency.\n\nThe alternate lower stem overlaps\nwith a UUUUCUU sequence (nucleotides 1676\u20131682) that resembles\nthe conserved UUUUUUA slippery sequence. In viruses resistant to protease\ninhibitors, the C in this downstream region is frequently mutated\nto U.38 At the protein level, this causes\na Leu to Phe mutation that may increase cleavage efficiency and enhance\nthe production of functional protease. This site could also act as\na secondary slippery sequence that increases the overall amount of\nframeshifting, thereby increasing the relative amount of protease\nto compensate for reduction in protease activity in the presence of\ninhibitor.39 When the standard slippery\nsequence is inactivated by mutation, the mutant with the C to U change\nin the alternate slippery site, but not that containing the wild-type\nsequence, stimulates frameshifting in in vitro translation\nassays. In cell culture, no frameshifting was detected from the secondary\nsite using HIV-1 sequences shorter than the 140-nt domain described\nhere.40 However, the construct used could\nnot form flanking structures such as the anchoring helix and the adjacent\n3-bp helix predicted by SHAPE-directed folding.\n\nWe therefore\nrevisited frameshifting from this alternate slippery sequence in the\ncontext of the complete frameshift domain. We inactivated the standard\nslippery sequence by site-directed mutagenesis (Figure 6, \u0394ss); this reduced frameshifting efficiency by 5-fold\nin the luciferase reporter assay. The reporter containing the C1680U\nmutation in the alternate slippery sequence in this \u0394ss background\n(Figure 6, mutant 6) showed a 3-fold increase\nin frameshifting efficiency relative to the \u0394ss construct. We\nthen disrupted the anchoring helix (Figure 6, mutant 7) and the adjacent 3-bp helix (mutant 8) in the \u0394ss\nbackground. Disruption of the anchoring helix had no effect on frameshift\nefficiency, but disruption of the 3-nt helix reduced frameshifting\nto levels similar to those of the \u0394ss construct. We conclude\nthat the C1680U mutation creates a second functional slippery sequence\nand that frameshifting from the secondary site requires both a slippery\nsequence and a downstream base-paired structure.\n\nHere,\nwe analyzed in detail the structure of the frameshift domain\nin the context of full-length HIV-1 genomic RNA. Our data provide\nsupport for the three main helices unique to the frameshift domain\nmodel proposed based on SHAPE-directed folding of an entire HIV-1\ngenome (Figure 1).15 Models for the frameshift domain that contain pseudoknots have recently\nbeen proposed;9 however, ex virio SHAPE data (Figure 1) and prior frameshifting\nassays22 do not support a contribution\nof these pseudoknots to the observed structural ensemble or frameshifting\nefficiency. Our model shares a stable upper stem with the previously\nproposed two-helix model11 but has two\nimportant differences. First, this study supports alternative pairing\npartners for bases in the conventional lower stem. Second, the SHAPE-directed\nmodel spans a 140-nt region that includes the slippery sequence and\nan additional stable anchoring helix.\n\nA key feature of the present\nstudy is the use of full-length genomic\nRNA. Using a long RNA avoids the biases that are often introduced\nwhen a truncated sequence of an RNA is studied and ensures that important\nstructural regions are not omitted. Most past studies of the HIV-1\nframeshift domain, including NMR analyses that tested the two-helix\nmodel,12,13 used HIV-1 sequences that were much shorter\nthan the 140-nt region that we show here, which constitutes the full\nframeshift domain. The three main helices unique to the SHAPE-directed\nmodel were thus unable to form in the truncated sequences analyzed\npreviously. Two of these helices, the alternate lower stem and the\nhelix that sequesters the slippery sequence, appear to mutually stabilize\neach other because disruption of either of these helices by LNA binding\ndestabilized or induced refolding of the other (Figure 2). Additionally, the anchoring helix likely stabilizes both\nof these helices. The frameshift domain adopts the same structure\nwhether the genomic RNA is probed directly after extraction from virions\nor is first heat-denatured and then refolded. This similarity suggests\nthat the differences between the SHAPE-directed model and the conventional\nmodel are due primarily to the presence of the complete sequence of\nthe viral RNA that was used in development of the SHAPE-directed model.\nCo-transcriptional RNA folding thus apparently does not alter the\nfolding of this region of the genome. However, inside virions, portions\nof the frameshift domain are less structured than in the extracted\nRNA, suggesting that higher-order protein or ligand interactions modulate\ndomain structure in the native virion environment.\n\nThe anchoring\nhelix and upper stem are very stable and persist\neven in the presence of high concentrations of formamide (Figure 3). Furthermore, the in virio experiments\nshow that these two helices are the only frameshift domain helices\nthat form stably inside the virion. In the absence of tertiary structure\nor other potentially stabilizing interactions, the conventional lower\nstem is predicted to be slightly more stable than the SHAPE-directed\nalternate lower stem, and in 20% formamide, we observed a switch from\nthe alternative stem to the conventional lower stem. These data suggest\nthat the structure of the frameshift region is dependent on the local\nmicroenvironment.\n\nThe changes induced by LNA binding suggest\nthat the structure of\nthe frameshift domain is dynamic as the ribosome moves through this\nregion. The anchoring helix is the first frameshift domain secondary\nstructural element to be unwound by the translating ribosome (Figure 7A,B). LNA binding experiments indicate that unwinding\nof this helix induces a major structural rearrangement throughout\nthe frameshift domain. The lower stem switches from the alternate\nhelix to the conventional stem conformation, and the slippery sequence\nhelix is significantly destabilized. The functional implications of\nthis structural rearrangement are not understood, but the importance\nof conformational switching was recently demonstrated in ribosomal\nrecoding in another retrovirus.41 Prior\nstudies using an RNA containing up to 90 nucleotides of the HIV-1\nframeshift domain sequence indicate that sequences in the conventional\nlower stem are functionally important for frameshifting in cultured\ncells but not in rabbit reticulocyte lysate.11,14 Our mutagenesis studies similarly show that disruption of the conventional\nlower stem does not yield detectable changes in frameshift efficiency\nin reticulocyte lysate (Figure 5, compare WT\nvs 3). Using a longer fragment of HIV-1 RNA that spans the entire\nSHAPE-defined domain (nts 1567\u20131711), we observed that disrupting\nthe alternate lower stem while allowing the conventional lower stem\nto form resulted in dramatically reduced frameshifting (Figure 5, mutant 4). In contrast, when both the anchoring\nhelix and the alternate lower stem were disrupted while preserving\nthe ability of the conventional lower stem to form, frameshifting\nactually increased above native-like levels (Figure 5, mutant 5). Thus, the frameshift domain structure\nis dynamic, and the stabilities of the component helices are coupled.\n\nAfter unwinding the anchoring\nhelix, the ribosome continues toward\nthe slippery sequence and encounters the conventional lower stem.\nLNA 2 binding data suggest that unwinding of the conventional lower\nstem results in a switch back to the alternate lower stem conformation\n(Figure 7C). The ribosome must then unwind\nthe very stable upper stem and switch reading frames. The high stability\nof the anchoring helix suggests that this structure may reform after\nthe ribosome has translated through it. If this is the case, the ribosome\nwould encounter the anchoring helix for a second time before exiting\nthe frameshift domain (Figure 7D). The adjacent\n3-bp helix could also potentially reform and would be able to serve\nas the frameshift stimulatory stem in HIV-1 sequence variants that\ncontain a second slippery sequence.\n\nFrameshifting efficiency\nassays performed in the present study\nrevealed that the secondary slippery site can indeed promote frameshifting.\nPrevious studies40 likely failed to detect\nframeshifting from this secondary site because of the use of truncated\nsequences that were unable to form downstream structures necessary\nfor frameshifting. Frameshift efficiency is primarily dependent upon\nthe local stability of the first three base pairs of the helix located\napproximately eight nucleotides from the slippery site, which is the\nlength of RNA required to span the distance from the slippery site\nto the ribosomal mRNA entrance channel.22 Consistent with this eight nucleotide distance, our results indicate\nthat frameshifting from the second slippery site is dependent upon\nthe integrity of the 3-bp helix but not the anchoring stem, which\nwould be too far away from the second slippery site to induce frameshifting\n(Figure 6).\n\nIn sum, this study confirmed\nkey structural elements specific to\nthe HIV-1 frameshift region model developed using SHAPE probing data\nas knowledge-based restraints18,19 to computational folding\nalgorithms.15 The frameshift region has\nsignificant conformational flexibility, and we hypothesize that a\nswitch occurs between the SHAPE-predicted helices and the two helices\nin the conventional model as the ribosome unwinds the frameshift element.\nFrom a functional perspective, the alternate lower stem is important\nfor native-like frameshift levels in the context of the larger domain\nstructure and consequently represents a potential therapeutic target.\nWe also examined the sequence and structural requirements of a previously\nidentified secondary frameshift site and found that its function is\ndependent on structural elements outside the traditional frameshift\ndomain but within the SHAPE-directed model. This work illustrates\nthe influence of global sequence context on RNA structure and the\nability of SHAPE probing to reveal complex functional domains in large\nRNAs."}
