RNase degradation assay (non-denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis) of the free siRNA as a function of the RNase A concentration. siRNA (300 ng) was incubated with increased concentrations of RNase A (0.02, 0.07, 0.162, 0.348, 0.7, and 3.3 \uf06dg / \uf06dg siRNA, in lanes 2 -3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9, 10-11, 12-13, respectively) siRNA RNase A RiboLock\u00ae Lane + + + + + + + + + + + + + -+ + + + + + + + + + + + -+ -+ -+ -+ -+ -+ -S2. Heparin decomplexation assay. Heparin is known as a model polyanion competing agent with nucleic acids for electrostatic interactions with polycations, 3 and it has been used to dissociate siRNA from several polycationic carriers. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Thus, heparin was used in this work to dissociate siRNA from PAMAM G4NH2 dendrimer. In order to determine the most favorable condition of heparin treatment to release the highest siRNA content from the dendriplexes, siRNA-G4NH2 at N/P 10 were formed in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 buffer, 10 as described in the Experimental Section, incubated with heparin in TE 1X pH 8 buffer at 37\uf0b0C for different time points, and frozen at -20\uf0b0C overnight. The final heparin concentration was 5 mg \uf0b4 mL -1 corresponding to 455 U per 1 \uf06dg siRNA calculated based on 1000 U per 1 mL. 4 The final siRNA concentration after dilution of the dendriplexes to 1 mL was 80 nM. siRNA-G4NH2 dendriplexes incubated in presence or absence of heparin (minimum of three independent batches, n = 3) were quantitatively analyzed using PicoGreen \u00ae assay 11 in Synergy 2 Microplate Reader (BioTek, VT) for the siRNA content released, which was calculated using a linear calibration curve (siRNA concentration vs. fluorescent units). Thus, siRNA released from the dendriplexes due to heparin treatment was determined based on the difference between the siRNA content truly complexed with G4NH2 (siRNA CE was applied in the calculations) and the free siRNA released and remaining in the dendriplexes dispersion. Appropriate control (PAMAM G4NH2 in presence of heparin, but no siRNA) was used as blank. The results are shown in Figure S2 , and indicate that the siRNA is released from G4NH2 dendrimer due to treatment of the dendriplexes with heparin. The incubation time of 30 min released the highest siRNA content -80% on average, and narrower standard deviation -out of the total siRNA complexed with G4NH2, and thus, it was chosen as standard time for all further heparin decomplexation assay experiments. constitutively express eGFP (enhanced green fluorescence protein) according to GenTarget protocol. 12 Briefly, A549 cells (passage 5) were seeded in 24-well microplate (25,000 cells per well) and cultured in 500 \uf06dL DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% AB (v/v) for 24 h at 37\uf0b0C and 5% CO 2 (Thermo Scientific Incubator, NAPCO 8000WJ). Cells were rinsed with PBS 1X buffer, and fresh culture medium (DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% AB, v/v) was added to them, following 50 \uf06dL per well of eGFP lentiviral particles. Cells were kept in incubator for 72 h at 37\uf0b0C and 5% CO 2 , and after that, they were rinsed with PBS 1X buffer, and the puromycin selective medium was added to them (DMEM + 10% FBS + 2.5 \uf06dg \uf0b4 mL -1 puromycin selective antibiotic; concentration was previously determined by a kill curve). Cells were cultured under this selective condition for 4 weeks, 13 dendriplexes alone were attempted to be formulated as pMDI. Dendriplexes at N/P 10 were prepared in RNase-free DI-water, the aqueous dispersion (siRNA and PAMAM G4NH2 at the same amount as what is loaded into CSLA and mannitol particles) was placed into the pressure proof glass vial, which was frozen (-20\uf0b0C) and lyophilized. The canister was crimp sealed with a 63 \uf06dL metering valve, and a known volume of propellant HFA-227 was filled into it so that the siRNA concentration was the same for pMDI formulations containing dendriplexes loaded into CSLA or mannitol particles. Then, the formulation was placed into sonication bath (30 min at 15 -20\uf0b0C) to disperse the dendriplexes in the propellant. As a result, the dendriplexes were observed getting stuck on the wall of the glass vial, and even after sonication for a long time, they did not disperse in the propellant as seen in Figure S5 . Thus, it was not possible to have pMDI formulations of free siRNA-G4NH2 dendriplexes for further comparison with those prepared with CSLA and mannitol particles. Therefore, this result presents the difficulty of formulating siRNA-based dendriplexes alone in propellant HFA, and strongly suggests that an appropriate micro-carrier is needed for the job -such as CSLA and mannitol which are being proposed in this work.
