{"title": "How domain growth is implemented determines the long term behaviour of a cell population through its effect on spatial correlations", "body": "Growth is of fundamental importance in biological systems [1, 2] . From embryonic development to tissue renewal, growth plays a central role in the development, maintenance and repair of biological systems throughout their lifetime [3] . Types of isotropic growth that have been observed in biological systems include exponential, linear and logistic [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Anisotropic growth also plays an important role in biological systems. For instance apical growth, whereby the tip region of a domain grows, is observed in plant root extension and chick limb outgrowth [12, 13] .\n\nImportantly, growth has also been shown to contribute in the development of biological systems in different ways. Experiments have shown that the advective component of domain growth is important in enabling migrating cells to reach their target site [6] [7] [8] [9] . Meanwhile, theoretical studies have suggested that differential growth rates in developing tissue allow the generation of diverse biological forms and structures [10, 14] . Consequently, it is important to include domain growth in many models of biological systems [1, 2, [6] [7] [8] [9] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .\n\nSpatial correlations are often observed in biological systems [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . For instance, in cell populations spatial correlations can be established by cell proliferation, as a new cell is naturally close to its parent cell following division. Individual-based models (IBMs) are able to recapitulate these spatial correlations, whereas models that employ certain mean-field approximations (MFAs), such as the logistic model [25] , and, in a spatially-extended context, the diffusion equation, cannot [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Accurate continuum models are important tools for understanding the behaviour of biological systems as, in contrast to IBMs, they generally allow for greater mathematical analysis. This analysis can be crucial in forming a mechanistic understanding of biological systems, which is not always apparent from simply studying the results of a large number of repeats of an IBM. Therefore, in order to derive accurate continuum approximations of IBMs that include cell proliferation it is often necessary to account for the effects of spatial correlations [25, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . cells), discrete random-walk model on a two-dimensional square lattice with volume-exclusion.\n\nWe had reasoned that a standard MFA would not be able to capture the behaviours exhibited by the IBM, and that this standard MFA would require correction by the inclusion of spatial correlations in the form of a correlation ordinary differential equation (ODE) to accurately approximate the IBM results. This last point has been shown previously in scenarios without growth [25] .\n\nThe outline of this work is as follows: to begin with we introduce the IBM and growth mechanisms in Section 2.1. We then define our individual and pairwise density functions, and derive a system of ODEs describing the evolution of the individual and pairwise density functions with respect to time on a growing domain in Sections 2.2-2.3. To test the accuracy of these ODE models we compare them with ensemble averages for the evolution of the macroscopic density from the IBM in Section 3. We demonstrate that the standard MFA is not able to accurately capture the effects of domain growth in the IBM, whereas the ODE models that include the effect of spatial correlations do.\n\nIn this section we introduce the IBM and the domain growth mechanisms we employ throughout this work. We then derive equations describing the evolution of the individual and pairwise density functions in the IBM for both growth mechanisms.\n\nThe IBM is simulated on a two-dimensional square lattice with lattice spacing \u2206 [40] and size to the same overall growth rate when implemented with the same growth rate parameters.\n\n(a) (b) Figure 1 : (Colour online). Before and after the growth events for both (a) GM1 and (b) GM2, in which growth is along the x-axis (horizontal direction) for a two-dimensional lattice. In each row the yellow (light grey) site has been chosen to undergo a growth event. Following this the yellow (light grey) site is moved to the right with its contents, for instance an agent (represented by a black cell). The blue (dark grey) sites are the new lattice sites and are always initially empty. The contents of all the other sites remain unaffected, although in some cases their neighbouring sites will change.\n\nWe define the individual density functions, \u03c1 For instance, (2, 3) would be the lattice site situated in the second row and the third column of the lattice.\n\nThe following derivation for the individual density functions is the same for GM1 and GM2.\n\nThe sum of the individual density functions on a domain of size N x \u00d7 N y at [t + \u03b4t) can be 5 author/funder.

(1) correspond to the following events: i) no growth event occurs in [t, t + \u03b4t); ii) a growth event occurs in the horizontal (x) direction in [t, t + \u03b4t); and iii) a growth event occurs in the vertical (y) direction in [t, t + \u03b4t).

It is important to note that Eq. (7) describes how exponential domain growth affects the evolution of individual density functions because we have defined P gx and P gy as constants. In the course of the following derivation it will be useful to write the pairwise density functions in terms of the distances between sites, therefore we shall rewrite the individual density functions as\n\nIf we substitute Eq. (8) into Eq. (7) we obtain dc(t) dt = \u2212(P gx + P gy )c(t).\n\nEq. (9) is a MFA describing the effect of domain growth on the evolution agent density [32] . 7 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Importantly, GM1 and GM2 affect the evolution of the pairwise density functions differently. Figure 2 displays two configurations of two agents, which we will term colinear and diagonal. . In (a), two colinear lattice sites share the same row but not the same column (or vice versa). In (b), two lattice sites are diagonal, meaning they do not share the same row or column. In both (a) and (b) r x is the distance between two lattice sites in the horizontal direction, and r y is the distance between two lattice sites in the vertical direction. In (b) this means r x = 3 and r y = 1.\n\nThe horizontal and vertical distances between sites is measured from their centres as displayed in Fig. 2 (b), and r x is the distance between two lattice sites in the horizontal direction, and r y is the distance between two lattice sites in the vertical direction.\n\nWe now derive equations for the evolution of the pairwise density functions for GM1 domain growth. We define the pairwise density functions, \u03c1 (m, m + (r x , r y ); t),\n\nwhere m is (i, j), with i indexing the row number of a lattice site, j indexing the column number of a lattice site, and (r x , r y ) is a vector that represents a fixed displacement as defined in Fig.   8 author/funder.

Therefore, we will further simplify our notation to obtain \u03c1 Nx\u00d7Ny 2 (m, m + (r x , r y ); t) = \u03c1 (r x , r y ; t).\n\nThis 'abuse' of notation, whereby \u03c1 Nx\u00d7Ny 2 is rewritten as a function of the displacement between two lattice sites as opposed to the lattice sites themselves, will prove useful in the following derivation.\n\nWe begin with the colinear component of the equations for the evolution of the pairwise density functions, that is, the scenario in which the lattice sites in question share the same column or row, as depicted in Fig. 2 (a) .

(25) the inclusion of agent proliferation means that pairwise density functions are now present in the equations for the evolution of the individual density functions, which is not the case without agent proliferation (Eq.

This means the normalised average agent density for the two-dimensional domain is\n\nHere 1 A is the indicator function for species A (i.e. 1 if species A occupies site i, and 0 if it does not). As previously discussed, the initial condition in the IBM is achieved by populating a certain number of sites uniformly at random until the initial density is achieved, the initial condition for the correlation function is therefore\n\nThat is, at all distances there are initially no spatial correlations between agents. We also rescale time to allow for ease of comparison between simulations with different parameters:\n\nThe rescaling of time is necessary to allow the easy comparison of simulations with different parameters. As before we solve our equations numerically with MATLAB's ode15s.\n\nIn Fig. 4 the effects of domain growth via GM1 on the evolution of the macroscopic agent density can be seen. We see that the inclusion of GM1 causes the steady-state density predicted by the standard MFA, Eq. (28), to be incorrect. The steady-state density calculated from an ensemble average from the IBM is lower than the MFA predicts, which the correlation ODE model (Eq. (27)) is able to capture. The rate at which the agent density increases is also reduced in the IBM due to spatial correlations, and the correlations ODE model better approximates this than the MFA. One may expect domain growth to decrease spatial correlations by 'breaking-up' existing agent clusters which, in turn, would allow greater agent movement and cause the MFA to be more accurate. However, the nature of GM1 means that it does not break up agents effectively, only potentially 'freeing-up' one lattice site for two agents in each row/column every growth event (see Fig. 1 ). GM1 also does not cause agents to make 16 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Therefore, the spatial correlations associated with agent proliferation (in conjunction with the dilution of agent density due to domain growth) lower the steady-state density of the agents more than the displacement of agents by domain growth counteracts the spatial correlations established by agent proliferation. In Fig. 5 the effect of GM1 on spatial correlations in both the correlation ODE model and the IBM can be seen. Importantly, we see that as the growth rate is increased the spatial correlations augment. From Fig. 4 this result is to be expected, as domain growth lowers the agent steady-state density but is not effective at reducing spatial correlations. A similar result has previously been observed in the case of agent death [25] . In addition, at the agent steady-state density the spatial correlations do not return to F = 1. This explains why the MFA incorrectly predicts the agent steady-state density, and shows why the correlation ODE model is able to correctly approximate the steady-state density of the IBM. This is because the MFA is only correct when F = 1, which is not the case in the IBM in this scenario with GM1.\n\n17 author/funder. All rights reserved.

In this case we see that GM2 causes the steady-state density predicted by the MFA to be correct. This is because GM2 is more effective at breaking up agent clusters than GM1, potentially 'freeing-up' one lattice site for four agents in each row/column every growth event. This counteracts the effect of the spatial correlations created by agent proliferation. GM2 also causes agents to change neighbouring agents in the IBM, and so further reduces the spatial correlations associated with agent proliferation. Despite this we see that the correlations ODE model still more accurately predicts the rate at which the agent density evolves, while also accurately approximating the steady-state density in the IBM. In Fig. 7 the effect of GM2 on spatial correlations can be seen in both the correlations ODE model and calculated directly from the IBM. In contrast to GM1 we see that as the growth rate is increased the spatial correlations decrease. We also see that at the steady-state density F = 1, this provides the reason as to why the agent steady-state predicted by the MFA is correct.\n\n19 author/funder. All rights reserved.

In the case of GM2, as the initial domain size is increased the evolution of the macroscopic agent density is accelerated. This is because colinear spatial correlations, established by agent proliferation, are broken down proportional to the domain size in GM2 (Eq. (20) ).\n\nFinally, in Fig. 9 we see the initial domain size also impacts the evolution of the spatial correlations for GM2, but not for GM1 (the figure displaying this is in Appendix B). In the case of GM2 as the initial domain size is increased the spatial correlations between agents are reduced. 21 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Many of the fundamental developmental processes that determine mammalian morphology are either characterised by growth, or occur during it, and so it is possible that growth may play an important role in determining and coordinating cell population behaviour [3, 9] .\n\nIn this work we have studied two different implementations of domain growth. We chose two different, yet potentially biologically relevant growth mechanisms [42] [43] [44] , to highlight how understanding the form of domain growth is crucial. These growth mechanisms originated from thinking about the different ways in which new sites could be added to the IBM domain, and the consequences this may have on agent density. As has been shown in this work, GM1 is an implementation of domain growth that conserves colinear correlations in comparison to diagonal correlations, and GM2 is one that reduces colinear correlations as a rate proportional to the size of the domain. This difference between GM1 and GM2 is why GM2 exhibits a length dependency and GM1 does not. It is important to stress we have used GM1 as an extreme example of growth in which the cell cycles of adjacent cells that are causing the domain to grow are synchronous (i.e. the cells in the underlying tissue), and GM2 as an example of when they are not. In reality, it is unlikely that domain growth in biological systems can be captured by algorithms as simple as GM1 and GM2. However, they represent the simplest and most tractable domain growth mechanisms for this initial study.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that we have only looked at scenarios where P p = P m . This case represents a very high rate of cell proliferation relative to motility in a biological context. However, we chose these parameters to highlight the accuracy of our approximate correlation ODE model. In situations where P p < P m the correlation ODE model approximates the IBM results even better, as has been shown previously [25, 39] . We have also only looked at the case when P gx = P gy in order to reduce the computational complexity of solving the model equations, however, the results presented here can be trivially extended to cases where P gx = P gy . 24 author/funder.
