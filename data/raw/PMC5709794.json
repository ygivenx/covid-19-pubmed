{"title": "Bilateral pulmonary nodules and acute respiratory failure in a 22-year-old man with dyspnoea and fever", "body": "KS is a slowly growing, multicentric, angioproliferative tumour associated with human herpesvirus (HHV)8 infection [1]. It is the most common tumour associated with HIV-1 infection; indeed, the incidence among patients infected with HIV is one in 20 [2, 3]. Four clinical variants of KS have been described:\nthe classic variant involves elderly men of Mediterranean and Eastern European Jewish origin [4, 5]the endemic variant primarily affects men from east and central Africathe iatrogenic variant is associated with immunosuppression and tends to be more aggressivethe AIDS-related variant affects patient with HIV-infectionKS usually presents with cutaneous lesions but it may involve other organs, mostly in the pulmonary and gastrointestinal systems. Intrathoracic localisation occurs in 20\u201375% of cases, particularly in severely immunocompromised patients with low CD4+ counts, with involvement of the lung parenchyma, pleura, LNs and airways [6\u20139]. Reports of isolated pulmonary disease have rarely appeared in the literature (0\u201316% of cases) [6, 7].Pulmonary KS is associated with poor outcome, but highly active antiretroviral therapy has been shown to markedly improve the prognosis.\n\nCommon symptoms are dry cough and dyspnoea [6]. Fever and haemoptysis can also be found. Typical radiological features are reticular opacities and parenchymal nodules with a bronchovascular distribution, especially in lower lung zones; consolidation; peribronchial cuffing; pleural effusion; and mediastinal lymphadenopathy [6]. However, chest radiography may be normal. A CT scan is more sensible and specific, and can show irregular, poorly defined nodules with speculated borders and peribronchovascular distribution, interstitial thickening and perinodular ground-glass halo signs (due to haemorrhage secondary to fragility of the neovascular tissue). Irregular narrowing of the bronchial lumen, interlobular septal thickening, air-space consolidation and pleural effusion may be associated with the aforementioned findings [6, 8]. Lymphadenopathy can be present in up to 30\u201335% of patients. The effusion can be transudative or exudative and is often haemorrhagic because of the vascular nature of the disease [10].\n\nTypical findings on bronchoscopy are red or purple maculopapular lesions that can narrow and obstruct the entire tracheobronchial tree. The identification of these lesions in the presence of classic radiographic involvement is sufficient to make diagnosis of pulmonary KS in the absence of evidence for opportunistic infections [11].\n\nBiopsy may be needed when parenchymal lesions occur in the absence of endobronchial involvement [10]. However, the diagnostic yield of endobronchial biopsies varies between 26% and 60% in different studies, and there is high risk of bleeding, especially for centrally located lesions [12, 13]: the decision to obtain a biopsy must be carefully weighed.\n\nThe histopathology of KS is nearly the same in all variants of disease. Advanced lesions consist of fascicles of spindle cells and vascular structure mixed with chronic infiltrates. On IHC, typical markers are CD31, CD34 and factor VIII-related antigen. Spindle cells express lymphatic markers such as LYVE-1 (lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1), VEGFR-3 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3) and Prox-1 (Prospero-related homeobox-1). The most important test to distinguish KS from others KS-mimicking diseases is the identification of HHV8 within KS lesion cells by immunostaining for LANA-1 (or LNA-1) [10].\n\nPulmonary KS is often indistinguishable from other opportunistic lung diseases in patients with AIDS. The differential diagnosis of diffuse pulmonary nodules includes: infective disease (tuberculosis or nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, fungal infection, or septic emboli), neoplastic disease (metastasis, lymphoma or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma), sarcoidosis and other miscellaneous conditions (granulomatosis with polyangiitis, pulmonary alveolar microlithiasis and pulmonary amyloidosis). It is very important to evaluate the size and location of nodules, and the presence of cavities [14\u201317].\n\nThe halo sign has been described in fungal, mycobacterial and viral infections; inflammatory disease (granulomatosis with polyangiitis) and malignancy. In immunocompromised patients, this radiological finding suggests an infection (e.g. invasive aspergillosis) or, less commonly, pulmonary KS and lymphoproliferative disorders [18].\n\nIn patients with HIV infection, subcentimetre pulmonary nodules with centrilobular distribution and cavitation may suggest infective disease, whereas larger nodules can suggest malignancy [19].\n\nIsolated intrathoracic KS is rarely seen. Moreover, in our case, the diagnosis was made more difficult by the lack of the patient\u2019s knowledge of his HIV infection. Clinical suspicion, accurate radiological description and multidisciplinary management were decisive in reaching a correct diagnosis."}
