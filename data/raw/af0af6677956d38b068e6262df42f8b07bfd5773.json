{"title": "Cryptosporidiosis in Idaho lambs: Natural and experimental infections", "body": "The protozoan organisms of the genus Cryptosporidium have recently been rec ognized as one of the most ubiquitous parasites of the gastrointestinal and respir atory tracts of man and animals (Dubey et al., 1990) . These organisms are in tracellular parasites which infect the cells lining the lumenal surfaces of their hosts' internal organs. Most infections result in symptomatic illness. Infections are especially common in neonatal and immunocompromised individuals. There is no effective therapy for cryptosporidial infection.\n\nErnest Edward Tyzzer is generally credited with the first identification of orga nisms belonging to the genus Cryptosporidium. In 1907, Tyzzer described pro tozoan parasites which he observed infecting the gastric epithelium of laboratory mice. The parasites attached to host cells and had asexual and sexual stages in their life cycles. He proposed that the mode of spread was by the fecal-oral route as he observed oocysts in feces. Tyzzer proposed the name Cryptosporidium muris for the organism. In 1910, Tyzzer extended his previous study by meticulously describing the life cycle of C. muris and proposed that the genus name Cryp tosporidium be adopted along with the new species name C. muris. Tyzzer also suggested that sporozoites liberated from mature oocysts in the gastric glands could produce autoinfection.\n\nIn 1912, Tyzzer described the morphology and life cycle of a new cryp tosporidial species infecting the small intestines of laboratory mice, he called it C. parvum. Although Tyzzer said that the parasites were cell associated, he was unable to verify their intracellular nature.\n\nIn 1929, Tyzzer reported the first cases of cryptosporidiosis in avians. The organisms infecting the chicken were in the cecal epithelium and he did not differentiate them from the species C. parvwn which he had seen in mice.\n\nInfections caused by Cryptosporidium were not recognized as important causes of morbidity and mortality until 1955 when Slavin observed C. meleagridis in 10-to 14-day-old turkey poults. The infections were accompanied by severe diarrhea and a few deaths. Despite this report, cryptosporidial research proceeded at a slow pace, and the parasite was largely ignored by the veterinary medical community.\n\nIn 1971, the first case of cryptosporidiosis in a calf was described. The infection was accompanied by severe diarrhea (Panciera et al, 1971) . Villous atrophy and numerous cryptosporidial organisms in the small intestines of the calf were observed at necropsy. Ironically, dexamethasone, in immunosuppressive synthetic steroid recently used to render adult rats susceptible to cryptosporidial infection, was among the drugs administered to the calf in attempts to effect a cure (Rehg et al, 1988) .\n\nVeterinary interest in Cryptosporidium was to be complemented by atten tion from the medical community following the 1976 reports of cryptosporidiosis in immunocompetent (Nime et al, 1976) and immunosuppressed humans (Meisel et al, 1976) . Only a few cases of human cryptosporidiosis were reported during the next 6 years; however, in 1982, severe cryptosporidial diarrhea was reported to have occurred in 21 males who had acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Anonymous, 1982) .\n\nCryptosporidium infections are considered to be of economic importance in do mestic livestock including poultry. In 1986, the annual cost of cryptosporidial diarrhea in bovines was estimated to exceed $6.2 million ). Significant morbidity and mortality have been observed in calves and lambs. Companion animals are also susceptible to cryptosporidial infection and may suffer from the infections.\n\nEpidemiologic data indicate that the zoonotic species, C. parvum, is widely distributed and occurs in all industrialized and developing countries where surveys have been conducted (Current, 1986; Fayer and Ungar, 1986; Janoff and Reiler, 1987; Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Tzipori, 1988) . In the numerous reports published since 1976, it has been convincingly demonstrated that C. parvum infections in immunocompetent humans are usually accompanied by diarrhea of short duration while infections in immunocompromised humans may be chronic, life threatening, and cholera-like (Current, 1986; Fayer and Ungar, 1986; Janoff and Reiler, 1987; Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Tzipori, 1988) .\n\nThe classification of organisms belonging to the genus Cryptosporidium, and a list of valid species, is presented in Table 2 .1. The structural and biological charac teristics on which this classification is based include: the presence of an apical complex with apical rings, micronemes, and subpellicular microtubules (phylum Apicomplexa); locomotion by body flexion, gliding, or undulation (class Sporozoasida); a life cycle which includes merogony (asexual multiplication), gamet ogony (sexual multiplication), and sporogony (sporozoite formation) (subclass Coccidiasina); the presence of merogony within vertebrate hosts (order Eucoccidiorida); independent development of male and female gametes (suborder Eimeriorina); and the completion of the life cycle within one host (homoxenous develop ment) wherein the parasite develops just under the surface membrane of the host cell, possesses microgametes without flagella, and oocysts with four sporozoites but no sporocysts (family Cryptosporidiidae) .\n\nParasites having the characteristics described previously but which are grouped in several families are collectively referred to as coccidia. The coccidia develop within the gastrointestinal tracts of their hosts through part or all of their life cycles. The genera Besnoitia, Caryospora, Frenkelia, Hammondia, Neospora, Sarcocystis, and Toxoplasma, the coccidia forming cysts in tissue, are members of the suborder Eimeriorina, family Sarcocystidae. They are capable of extraintes tinal multiplication. Members of the family Eimeriidae, including the genera Eimeria and Isospora, live exclusively within the gastrointestinal or respiratory Hoover et al. (1981) epithelium but differ from the Cryptosporidiidae in that they develop within the cytoplasm of the host cell, their microgametes possess flagella, and their oocysts have sporocysts with eight sporozoites. Species of Cryptosporidium frequently have been named according to the host in which they were initially observed. This convention arose from the belief that Cryptosporidium was host specific. The literature, at present, contains the names of 21 species of Cryptosporidium (Fayer et ai, 1990b) . Cross-transmission studies and careful morphometric analyses, however, have placed the validity of many of these species in doubt. The currently recognized species of Cryptospori dium include C. muris of mice and cattle, C. parvum of a wide variety of mam malian species including man, C. baileyi of chickens, C. meleagridis of turkeys, C. serpentis of snakes, and C. nasorum which occurs in fish (Fayer et ai, 1990b) . Studies of the life cycles, morphology, host specificity, and molecular biology of parasites presumably belonging to this genus may yet reveal that there are species of Cryptosporidium in addition to those currently accepted.\n\nCryptosporidium parvum is the only species of the genus considered to produce infection and disease in man at this time, although there is a very recent report that C. baileyi has been observed in an immune-deficient individual (Ditrich et ai, 1991) . While biological and molecular differences have been observed among C. parvum found infecting various animals, subspecies or strains are not yet recognized.\n\nTyzzer's initial detailed description of the life cycle of C. muris which he observed in the gastric glands of laboratory mice along with descriptions based on recent studies of C. parvum in mice, in chick embryos, and in various cells in culture have demonstrated that C. parvum has a life cycle similar to that of coccidia. The life cycle consists of stages, i.e., excystation, merogony, gametogony, fertilization, oocyst formation, and sporogony (Figure 2.1). Tyzzer and others reported that the development of Cryptosporidium may be extracellular. Electron microscopic stud ies, however, indicate that various portions of the life cycle take place in a vacuole in the cytoplasm just under the host cell's plasma membrane. Unlike other coc- \n\nCryptosporidium oocysts are fully sporulated and contain fully developed sporo zoites when they leave their host. Oocysts of other coccidia sporulate in the environment after leaving the host. Each oocyst of Cryptosporidium contains four sporozoites which lie naked within the oocyst. The oocysts of other coccidia contain sporocysts which contain the sporozoites. The fact that the oocysts of Cryptosporidium are sporulated before passage makes them immediately infective to the next susceptible host.\n\nThe release of sporozoites normally occurs in the small intestine of the host after oocysts have been ingested . As with other coccidia, exposure to reducing conditions, enzymes and bile salts are all important factors in excystation. Oocysts exposed to appropriate conditions outside the host also can excyst (Current, 1990) . Oocysts have even been induced to excyst by exposure to 37\u00b0C tap water (Current, 1986) or by exposure to a mild bleach solution followed by exposure to 37\u00b0C water . The release of sporozoites under these conditions is probably due to osmotic stress. Bile salts alone induce excystation and the effect of bile is enhanced considerably if oocysts are first subjected to an oxidizing agent, such as a weak hypochlorite solution Woodmansee, 1987; Coffman, 1989) . Exposure of oocysts overnight to between 4 and 23\u00b0C facilitates excystation when the precooled oocysts are incubated in phosphate-buffered saline for several hours at 37\u00b0C (Current, 1990) . The optimal pH for excystation and sporozoite survival in vitro is between 6.8 and 7.4 (Woodmansee, 1987) .\n\nExcystation is accompanied by the dissolution of the suture at one end of the oocyst wall. Sporozoites escape through the opening created by the breakdown of this suture (Figures 2.2 and 2.3). Similar sutures have been observed in sporocysts, but not oocysts of related coccidia. This has led to the suggestion that the en vironmentally resistant stage of Cryptosporidium is really a sporocyst, not an oocyst . Studies on oocyst wall development and the process of sporulation within host cells, however, do not confirm this notion (Current, 1986) .\n\nThe asexual merogonic cycle commences soon after the excysted sporozoites attach to and invade host cells; these are most commonly enterocytes. In addition to development within enterocytes, parasite development has been reported to occur in cells of the conjunctiva and within cells of the respiratory and biliary tree. Sporozoites of Cryptosporidium, unlike those of most coccidia, only penetrate the zone just beneath the host cell's outer limiting membrane.\n\nThe process of sporozoite attachment and internalization, with a few ex ceptions, it not unlike that of other apicomplexan parasites (Lumb et ai, 1988b) . A probing action by the sporozoites causes an indentation in the host cell's limiting membrane. This indentation develops until it encompasses the parasite, which when the process is completed, lies within a vacuole of host cell origin. A dense band forms beneath the cell membrane nearest the sporozoite's apical end. The contents of the sporozoite's micronemes are released during penetration. The sporozoite's anterior end and the membrane of the vacuole near the anterior end fuse with the host cell membrane. This region undergoes further differentiation to form the \"feeder organelle\" which attaches the parasite to the host cell. The function of this organelle has not been completely defined; it has been suggested, however, that its membranous folds may provide a surface area through which the exchange of materials between the host cell and the parasite may occur.\n\nAfter the feeder organelle is developed, the sporozoite rounds up within the parasitophorous vacuole and becomes a uninucleate trophozoite (Figure 2 .4). The cytoplasm of the trophozoite takes on the characteristics of an actively synthe sizing and growing parasite. As the trophozoite develops, the feeder organelle further differentiates; it forms a junction which strengthens the attachment of the parasite to the host cell (Figure 2 .4). Studies in mice indicate that trophozoites develop into Type I meronts with six to eight merozoites between 8 and 16 hours postinfection (Current and Reese, 1986) . In this process the nucleus of the tro phozoite divides. Three successive synchronous nuclear divisions result in the production of eight nuclei which migrate to the parasite's periphery to form buds that eventually become fully differentiated merozoites. This process is called ectomerogony (Figures 2.5 and 2.6). No nuclear division spindles, plaques, or centrioles have been observed. Mature Type I meronts have been observed in infected mice 16 hours after infection. The persistence of Type I merogony is one of the reasons for the severity of the infections which occur in AIDS patients.\n\nThe six to eight merozoites released by Type I meronts invade adjacent host cells where they produce another crop of Type I meronts or where they may develop into Type II meronts (Figure 2 .7). Mature Type II meronts have been observed in animals infected for 24 hours or more. The persistence of Type II merogony, however, unlike that of Type I merogony, is presumably the result of a cycle involving the continued production of autoinfective oocysts. Type II meronts produce merozoites that are probably destined to become gamonts. Type II meronts and Type I meronts are produced in a similar process. The only difference is that only four Type II merozoites are produced (Figures 2.8 and 2.9).\n\nType I and II merozoites differ slightly in size: 5.3 \u03c7 1.0 and 4.7 \u03c7 1.2 \u03bc\u03c0\u03b9, respectively. Their architecture and behavior appear to be identical. Both are banana-shaped, both have a complex pellicle consisting of a plasmalemma plus a double inner membrane complex, both have an apical complex consisting of preconoidal rings and micronemes, and both possess subpellicular microtubules, a nucleus, and ribosomes. They do not have a conoid, polar rings, micropores, or mitochondria such as are present in other coccidia.\n\nMerozoites of Type II meronts become macro (female)-or micro (male)-gamonts in their host cells. The majority become macrogamonts. Gamonts in various stages of development are present from 36 (microgamont) and 48 (macrogamont) hours after infection and continue to be present until the end of the infection (Current and Reese, 1986) .\n\nMicrogamonts are easily differentiated from meronts. Microgamonts con tain many more nuclei, have no microneme anlagen, and may contain as many as 16 compact nuclei. As the microgamont develops the nuclei migrate to the per iphery of the gamont and enter the budding microgamete to form the bullet-shaped microgametes (Figure 2 .10). Microgametes are about 1.4 \u03c7 0.4 \u03bc\u03c0\u03b9 and have a compact, centrally located nucleus that is surrounded by microtubules derived from a conical structure at one end of the microgamete. Microgametes contain numerous cytoplasmic granules and lack the flagella and mitochondria present in the microgametes of other coccidia.\n\nMacrogamonts are easily distinguished from Cryptosporidium in other stages of development because they contain numerous amylopectin-like granules and because they have peripherally located wall-forming bodies of two types (WFBI and WFBII) (Figure 2 .13). The granules and wall-forming bodies are similar to those of macrogamonts of related coccidia.\n\nMicrogametes presumably attach to and penetrate mature macrogametes ( Figure  2 .11). The actual events of penetration and of the fusion of microgamete and \n\nFollowing fertilization, the zygote develops into either a thick-walled or a thinwalled oocyst. Each oocyst contains four naked sporozoites. About 80% of the oocysts formed are thick-walled. Oocysts can be observed after 72 hours of infection (Current and Reese, 1986) . During development of the thick-walled oocysts the zygote cytoplasm separates from the feeder organelle ( Figure 2 .13) while two membranes that are external to the zygote plasmalemma develop. Wall-forming bodies move to a position just under the plasmalemma. The wall-forming bodies disappear, presumably because their contents are trans ported across the plasmalemma to form the outer coarse and inner granular layers of the oocyst wall. The completed oocyst wall consists of two chitinous layers and three membranes (Figure 2 .14). The inner layer contains a suture at one pole which spans one-third to one-half the oocyst circumference.\n\nApproximately 20% of the oocysts formed are of the thin-walled variety (Figure 2 .16). Thin-walled oocysts are bounded by a single unit membrane. These oocysts are rare in feces expelled from an infected host because they excyst spontaneously within the intestines and at extraintestinal sites. These cysts pre sumably account for the persistence of the infections in immunocompromised hosts (Crawford and Vermund, 1988) .\n\nSporogony occurs while the oocyst wall is developing. Four sporozoites form within the zygote's cytoplasm (Figure 2 .15). Sporogony is similar to mer ogony except that the first nuclear division in sporogony is meiotic, restoring the sporozoite to a haploid genomic complement. Sporozoites are structurally similar to merozoites except for having a more tapered anterior end, centrally located amylopectin granules, and a posteriorly situated nucleus.\n\nCryptosporidium parvum undergo complete development in various cell culture systems and in chicken embryos (Current and Long, 1983; Current and Haynes, 1984; Datry et ai, 1989; Flanigan et al. y 1991) . Cryptosporidium baileyi grows readily in chicken embryos but not in cell cultures (Current and Long, 1983; Current and Snyder, 1988) . Cryptosporidium muris has been reported to grow in baby hamster kidney cells (Naciri et ai, 1986) , but a careful examination of the latter report indicates that the authors may have mistakenly identified the parasite as C. muris, when in fact they were working with C. parvum. While the foregoing reports appear encouraging, only the reports of cultivation of C. baileyi in chicken embryos are without ambiguities (Current and Long, 1983) . Inoculation of the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chicken embryos with sporozoites of C. baileyi is followed by an intense proliferation of parasites. The parasites grow in endoderm cells and subsequently release large numbers of oocysts into the chorioallantoic fluid. Oocysts derived from embryos have been used to infect other embryos over a period of 3 years. The cultured C. baileyi retain their infectivity and pathogenicity for chickens (Current and Snyder, 1988) .\n\nHuman and calf isolates of C. parvum both develop in the CAM of chicken embryos (Current and Long, 1983) . The timing and sequence of development appear to be similar to that reported to occur in the ileum of experimentally infected neonatal mice. There are two problems in cultivation of C. parvum in chicken embryos: The oocysts of C. parvum are not easily released from the CAM into the chorioallantoic fluid, which makes their recovery difficult, and not all embryos are equally susceptible to infection. Trial and error appear to be the only way to determine susceptibility.\n\nCryptosporidium parvum undergoes development in cells of several lines (Current and Haynes, 1984; Woodmansee and Pohlenz, 1984; Datry et al, 1989; Flanigan et al, 1991) . Unfortunately, the extent of multiplication in the various types of cells tested varies widely and at best is much less than what is normally encountered in experimentally infected animals. It has been hypothesized that a major reason for poor growth of C. parvum in cells in culture lies in the inability of the parasite to produce thin-walled autoinfective oocysts in vitro (Current and Haynes, 1984) .\n\nAttempts to grow Cryptosporidium other than C. parvum in vitro have not been encouraging. More attention needs to be given to defining the conditions under which Cryptosporidium can be propagated in cell culture systems. The lack of a good system for culturing Cryptosporidium has hampered studies on its life cycle. \n\nThe early literature on Cryptosporidium gives the impression that it is an organism which is host specific. This idea undoubtedly can be traced to the fact that this organism is a relative of coccidia of the genus Eimeria, which are host specific. It was the convention to consider that every Cryptosporidium encountered in a new host was a new species. As a result there are some 21 species of Cryp tosporidium named in the literature (Fayer et ai, 1990b) .\n\nA great deal of valuable information on host specificity and on the validity of species of Cryptosporidia has been obtained by cross-transmission studies. The currently accepted species have been determined in large part by data obtained by such studies. In cross-transmission studies the oocysts obtained from an animal of one species are tested to determine if they are infective to animals of another species.\n\nOocysts isolated from mammals of one species are generally infective to mammals of other species, oocysts from birds may or may not infect other birds, and cross-transmission between vertebrates of different classes does not occur (Current et ai, 1986; Fayer and Ungar, 1986; Lindsay et ai, 1987a; O'Donoghue et al, 1987; Iseki et ai, 1989) .\n\nCryptosporidium parvum has loose host specificity. Isolates from humans have proven infective to cats, cattle, dogs, goats, other humans, mice, pigs, rats and sheep. Transmission of C. parvum to humans from cats, cattle, and pigs also has been reported Fayer et ai, 1990b) . Undoubtedly, further work will show that infectivity of C. parvum for mammals is general since more than 40 mammalian species have been shown to harbor the parasite. The data available underscore the zoonotic potential of Cryptosporidia. People working in professions with frequent animal contact are at particular risk.\n\nDirect spread of oocysts from person to person by the fecal-oral route is the major mode of transmission of Cryptosporidium. Fecal contamination of food and water contribute to the high prevalence of cryptosporidial infection in persons where poor sanitary conditions exist. Contaminated food, fomites, flies, and water are sources of infection with Cryptosporidium (Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Casemore, 1990; Ungar, 1990a) . The documentation of waterborne transmission in dicates that the epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis is not unlike that of giardiasis. The epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis is undoubtedly influenced by the ability of the thick-walled, fully sporulated oocyst to survive in the environment. Commonly employed chemical disinfectants are ineffective against the oocyst at concentrations commonly used. Oocyst viability is reduced by exposure for 30 minutes to 10% formalin, to 50% or higher concentrations of ammonia, and to 70 to 100% commercial bleach (Angus et al, 1982a; Campbell et al, 1982) , but such concentrations are much higher than are commonly used in hospitals and in laboratories. Disinfection of drinking water by commonly used procedures has not proven effective (see Treatment and Control). Oocyst viability is reduced by exposure for 30 minutes to temperatures above 65\u00b0C or below freezing (-20\u00b0C) (Tzipori, 1983; Anderson, 1985) . Oocysts will survive at 4\u00b0C for longer than 3 to 4 months when stored in 2.5% potassium dichromate (k 2 Cr 2 0 7 ) (Current and Haynes, 1984) .\n\nIt is probable that oocysts may survive for extended periods under natural conditions but few critical experiments to determine survival of oocysts under natural conditions have been undertaken. In one series of experiments, however, it was found that oocyst viability dropped from 72 to 46% and 20% when they were stored for 4 weeks in distilled, deionized water at 25 and 8\u00b0C, respectively (C. R. Sterling, unpublished data).\n\nThe epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis is undoubtedly affected by the dose of oocysts required to produce infection. Critical studies to define the dose of C. parvum required to induce infection have so far been performed only on mice and guinea pigs. These studies have shown that the ID 50 for infant mice is somewhere between 60 and 1000 oocysts (Ernest et al, 1986; Riggs and Perryman, 1987; Korich et al, 1990) . Mice 3 weeks of age and older are resistant to infection (Sherwood et al, 1982) . Guinea pigs 6 weeks of age, which are considered to be adults, can become infected if given as few as 325 oocysts (Chrisp et al, 1990) . In one study, two nonhuman primate infants became infected when given only 10 oocysts (Miller et al, 1990) . From these studies it may be assumed that the infectious dose for humans is small. Current information indicates that age, im mune status, and prior history of exposure all influence susceptibility of humans.\n\nCryptosporidium has been reported to occur naturally in mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, cats, dogs, squirrels, raccoons, horses, pigs, sheep, goats, cattle, and several species of nondomesticated ruminants (Dubey et al, 1990) . Except for those on cattle (Anderson, 1989) , few large-scale epidemiological studies have been un-dertaken (see Host-Parasite Relationships: Cryptosporidiosis in Mammals Other Than Man). The loose host specificity of Cryptosporidium in mammals indicates that any of these animals could serve as a source of human infection.\n\nCryptosporidium infection in humans is widely distributed in all types of countries (Tables 2.2 and 2.3). Numerous prevalence studies have been conducted but the data available are not always easy to compare because the populations sampled differ in age, symptomatology, and immune status and because different sampling and diagnostic techniques were used to assess infection Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Ungar, 1990a) . In addition, in many studies appropriate control groups were not included. Nonetheless, several gen eralizations can be made from the myriad of studies performed. It may be con cluded that the overall prevalence in industrialized countries is about 2.1%, in fection is observed more frequently in children (3.0%) than in adults (0.8%), and individuals with symptoms are more likely to be infected than asymptomatic individuals. In addition, it is possible that in countries with poor sanitation the prevalence rate among patients whose immune status is unknown is about 8.5%. In general it may be concluded that serologic surveys conducted in all types of countries indicate a rate of seropositivity higher than would be indicated by the incidence of symptoms (Table 2. 3). It is also generally true that Cryptosporidium infection occurs with greater frequency in persons whose immune status is im paired, but who do not have AIDS, than in the general population. Such persons include those with a variety of conditions which cause immunosuppression as well as those who are undergoing immunosuppressive therapy. It is also certainly true that very young, malnourished infants and the very old suffer more severely from Cryptosporidia than do others because they have a diminished immune responsive ness.\n\nAs mentioned previously Cryptosporidium infection is common among AIDS patients. The reported prevalence in AIDS patients in the United States is close to 3%. This figure, however, probably only represents the percentage of cases occurring in patients whose AIDS cases are reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Cryptosporidium prevalence rates of 15 and 16% in AIDS patients with diarrhea have been observed by workers in the United States and United Kingdom. In underdeveloped countries, rates of infection in AIDS patients may approach 40%.\n\nThere is seasonal variability in the frequency of Cryptosporidium infection. High rates of stool positivity have also been frequently reported to occur during, or immediately following, rainy months.\n\nBreast feeding may afford protection against infection in infants. A number of recent studies have shown a prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection in chil dren who are exclusively breast fed lower than that in ones given bottles. A controlled cohort study, currently being conducted in Peru, shows a significant negative relationship between antibody titers in breast milk, infection rates, and severity of Cryptosporidium infection among the children receiving breast milk (unpublished data).\n\nA variety of risk factors may contribute to cryptosporidiosis: deficiency in cellular and humoral immunity, occupational exposure, use of poor sanitary facil ities, youth, close contact with infected individuals, travel, and ingestion of con taminated food. As more carefully planned and executed studies are conducted, more information on the epidemiology of Cryptosporidium and cryptosporidiosis will be discovered.\n\nTechniques for the detection and recovery of Cryptosporidium from water have been developed. The techniques developed permit an assessment of the potential for waterborne transmission of this as well as of other organisms. The develop ment of these techniques was a direct result of the rise of interest in the waterborne disease caused by Giardia. While there are striking similarities in the epidemiol ogy of cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis, there are also differences. The oocysts of Cryptosporidium are, for example, smaller than those of Giardia (4-6 \u03bc\u03c0\u03b9 vs. 8-12 \u03bc\u03c0\u03b9), thus requiring a more efficient filtration system for their removal.\n\nOne of the procedures that has been developed to detect Cryptosporidia in water is the \"EPA method\" (Jakubowski and Ericksen, 1979) . This method uses a gasoline-powered water pump to facilitate the filtration of large volumes of water through a spun polypropylene cartridge filter having standard porosity. The ma terials trapped on the filter are eluted and concentrated and then there is a direct microscopic examination of the material for the detection of oocysts.\n\nWhen first used, this method gave a very poor rate of recovery and ways were sought, therefore, to improve it. The rate of elution was improved by backflushing nitrogen under pressure, by cutting apart the filters, and by agitating the cut fibers in the backflush effluent. The processing of the eluted material was also improved by its fixation in 10% neutral-buffered formalin or by agitation in a detergent solution of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and a 0.1% Tween 80 (SDS/Tween) to break up large aggregates. The proportion of oocysts in the samples which were detected in the sample trap was further improved by the use of gradient centrifugation procedures employing sucrose (1.23 g/ml), potassium citrate (1.195 g/ml), or Percoll-sucrose (1.09 g/ml) gradients. Finally, detection methodologies were improved by the use of cellulose nitrate membrane filters to capture the parasites and by the use of fluorescent-labeled polyclonal or mono clonal antisera to enhance parasite detection (Musial et al, 1987; LeChevallier et al, 1990) .\n\nDespite the fact that there have been significant improvements in the basic EPA method, the method remains labor intensive and costly. A wide range in recovery efficiencies occurs depending on the quality of water being tested. An accurate determination of oocyst numbers present, therefore, is only possible if seeded samples are run to determine recovery efficiency in the water samples. The procedure is, however, gaining a measure of acceptance and is being proposed as a standard reference method.\n\nThe numbers of oocysts detected in samples from waters which were the sources of several waterborne outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis varies widely and it is thus difficult to assign a value to levels of contamination which may cause an outbreak. The fact that the minimal infectious dose to humans has not been determined and that no tests exist to determine whether recovered oocysts are viable also com plicates determining levels of contamination that pose a risk. In addition, the tests that are used to determine the presence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in water do not permit discrimination between oocysts which might infect humans and those which may not. It is because of these problems that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proceeding cautiously in promulgating regulations to define permissible levels of this parasite in drinking water.\n\nOocysts of Cryptosporidium are widely distributed in water. In the United States oocysts have been recovered from surface waters that are probably con taminated with sewage (0.8 to 5800/liter), from pristine surface waters (0.005 to 18/liter), from raw and treated sewage effluents (4.1 to 5180/liter), and from drinking water (0.001/liter) (Sterling, 1990) . Recovery rates are the highest from water receiving sewage and feces and from streams adjacent to agricultural areas where there is much surface runoff. In the western United States, 77% of 107 sites tested contained oocysts. A survey in Arizona showed 23.8% of 101 sites to be contaminated with oocysts. Oocysts also have been detected in water from nu merous sources in the United Kingdom (Gallaher et al, 1989; Casemore, 1990; Smith and Rose, 1990) .\n\nThere has been no extensive testing of water from Third World countries. In one study, however, oocysts were recovered from cisterns containing drinking water, from water delivery trucks, and from oxidation ponds in poor residential communities near Lima, Peru (unpublished data). The presence of many fecal coliform bacteria in these waters indicates that there is a high level of fecal contamination, although the presence of fecal coliform bacteria in itself may not always be an indicator of the presence of Cryptosporidia. Children in Third World countries have a high rate of infection with Cryptosporidium. Because drinking water in many poor countries is contaminated and because Cryptosporidium prevalence rates are high in children in regions where contaminated water is used indicate that water should be considered a likely source of infection.\n\nThe source of the oocysts in the water is still an open question. Because of its loose host specificity, there is a great potential for water contamination by Cryptosporidium from nonhuman sources but whether nonhuman sources of Cryptosporidium are in fact common is not known.\n\nThat Cryptosporidium infection was the result of contact with contaminated environments was first proposed by physicians treating travelers who were also infected with other enteropathogens which are frequently present in contaminated water and food (Jokipii et ai, 1985) . In later studies of outbreaks of cryptosporidi osis in the United States and the United Kingdom oocysts were first identified in infected individuals before oocysts were found in their drinking water. An ex ample of this was found in an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Braun Station, a suburb of San Antonio, Texas, during the summer of 1984 (D'Antonio et \u03b1\u03ca, 1985) . People drinking water from a well in this community had an attack rate of gastrointestinal illness approximately 12 times that of surrounding communities. Oocysts were found in the stools of 47 of 79 residents of the community. Oocysts were not recovered from the well water, although fecal coliform counts were high in it. The well water was chlorinated but unfiltered.\n\nSeveral additional outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in the United States and the United Kingdom have been considered on epidemiological evidence to have had their source in drinking water. In outbreaks in New Mexico and Sheffield, England, there was a statistical association of infection with consumption of either surface or other contaminated water. Subsequently person-to-person transmission occurred (Rush et ai, 1987; Gallaher et ai, 1989) .\n\nPerhaps the best known waterborne outbreak occurred in Carrollton, Geor gia, in January and February, 1987, in which there were an estimated 13,000 cases of gastroenteritis (Hayes et ai, 1989) . Oocysts were identified in stools of 39% of the patients during the outbreak. A random telephone survey of people in the city and county indicated that there was an even higher attack rate than was indicated by the survey of patients. People in the community who used bottled water did not develop Cryptosporidium infection. Low numbers of oocysts were encountered in the system's water mains, in streams draining into the system's reservoirs, and in dairy cattle grazing on land in the watershed. A recommendation that water be boiled before use was put into effect on January 30 and remained in effect until March 2. The outbreak ceased shortly thereafter.\n\nIn this outbreak the newly developed and modified EPA sampling methodol ogy was used for the first time. The EPA is now recommending that the EPA technique be used to test all water suspected of containing Cryptosporidia. Com munities which rely solely upon disinfection as a means of water treatment should have their water tested for Cryptosporidia. The water treatment plant in Carrollton at the time of the outbreak was using both filtration and disinfection. Despite the fact that they were in general following normal operating procedures, an investiga tion revealed that there might have been some deficiencies in the procedures used for water treatment. They may have, for instance, started use of an unusually large number of filters without backflushing them. This may have caused the release of a bolus of oocysts into the drinking water supply. In addition, the mechanical agitators which are a part of the equipment used to flocculate suspended materials were not operable at the time of the epidemic and the equipment used to control water flow through the filters was also not operating properly.\n\nThe role of contaminated water in outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis subsequent to the outbreak which occurred at Carrollton has been confirmed by use of the EPA sampling methodology. In Scotland, for example, oocysts were detected in surface water which had entered a treated water supply through a previously undetected drain (Smith et al, 1988) . In an epidemic in the Oxford and Swindon areas of England, oocysts were detected in the surface water, in samples of water from filter backwashes, and in potable water. In this epidemic, which occurred between December, 1988, and April, 1989 , there were 516 confirmed cases of Cryp tosporidium infection (Anonymous, 1989) . In still another outbreak in the United Kingdom there were more than 70 cases. The source of infection was a poorly maintained swimming pool (Galbraith, 1989) . It is apparent that constant vigilance must be maintained to prevent Cryptosporidium oocysts from passing the filtration and disinfection barriers of even good water purification systems.\n\nSix species of Cryptosporidium occur in snakes, lizards, turtles, and fish (Upton, 1990) . Four of the reported species of snakes and lizards are either nomen nuda or species of Sarcocystis. Cryptosporidium serpentis, which was first observed in captive snakes in 1977, is currently the only recognized species in reptiles (Brownstein et ai, 1977) , and C. nasorum, detected in a marine tropical fish purchased in a pet store, is the only recognized species in fish (Hoover et ai, 1981) . Recent surveys of Cryptosporidium of amphibia, reptiles, and fish have uncovered evidence that there are several morphologic types of Cryptosporidium in these animals. The differences in developmental forms and in oocyst size and shape make it likely that several species probably occur in lower vertebrates (Upton, 1990) . Since cross-transmission studies have not been performed on any of the Cryptosporidia observed in these studies, it is probably best to follow the current convention which recognizes only C. serpentis and C. nasorum. Even the latter species has yet to be validated by transmission studies.\n\nDisease caused by Cryptosporidium has been reported to occur in a species of Sauria, 2 species of Testudines, and 22 species of Serpentes. Reptiles infected include ones classified as boids, colubrids, elapids, and viperids (Upton, 1990) . Cryptosporidiosis is a clinical problem primarily in captive reptiles (Upton et al, 1989) , while in wild populations, clinical symptoms have generally not been noted. The prevalence rate of infection in reptiles appears to be low (<2%), even among captive zoo animals. Infection in snakes may be persistent. Anorexia, regurgitation, lethargy, midbody swelling, and weight loss are prominent clinical signs. Organisms are found in gastric mucosa on histological examination. In the gastric region lesions are hyperplastic and hypertrophic and there is atrophy of glandular cells, inflammation of the mucosa, and edema of the submucosa and lamina propria. There is an inflammatory response characterized by aggregations of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and heterophils. Excess mucus production, multi focal necrosis, and mucosal petechiae may occur. Bacterial and viral infection may complicate C. serpentis infection. The role of bacteria and viruses in the patho genesis and the susceptibility of snakes to cryptosporidial infection, however, is not known.\n\nThe few reports of clinical cryptosporidiosis in lizards and turtles indicate a disease similar to that seen in snakes (Upton, 1990) . Most reports of crypto sporidiosis in lizards and turtles have been based on postmortem examination of captive animals.\n\nCryptosporidium has been identified in the stomachs and intestinal tracts of six named and one unnamed species offish (Upton, 1990) . The clinical description given in the first report of cryptosporidiosis of fish is similar to the description of the disease occurring in snakes. The disease occurred in a tropical marine fish (Naso lituratus) kept in a home aquarium with other fish (Hoover et ai, 1981) . The fish suffered from anorexia, was emaciated, and regurgitated and passed un digested food. The parasite in various developmental stages was found on the microvillus surface of the intestinal tract. The parasite was named C. nasorum. Clinical signs generally have not been encountered in infected fish.\n\nThere is a report that Cryptosporidium was found in the intestinal contents of brown trout netted from a reservoir near Sheffield, United Kingdom, following a waterborne outbreak of disease in humans in the summer of 1986 (Rush et al, 1987) . Oocysts were identified in the intestinal contents of 7 of 18 fish by microscopy and an enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Histologic studies were not performed on the intestines of any of the fish so it is impossible to tell if the oocysts observed were a result of actual infection or were merely oocysts which had been ingested by the fish. Cryptosporidium oocysts were found in 10 of 14 water samples taken from the reservoirs implicated in the outbreak.\n\nCross-transmission studies are needed to determine if the Cryptosporidia of lower vertebrates belong to valid species and to determine if any are capable of infecting other classes of vertebrates. In two studies fish were not infected by C. parvum oocysts or by oocysts from a saurian or from infant mice (Upton, 1990) .\n\nStudies of cryptosporidiosis in birds were again initiated 35 years after Tyzzer's observation of Cryptosporidium in the ceca of chickens (Tyzzer, 1929) . Tyzzer, unfortunately, did not name the organism or give a description of its oocysts or its other life cycle stages. Contemporary research indicates that birds may harbor four species of Cryptosporidium (Lindsay and Blagburn, 1990) . Two species, C. anserinum and C. tyzzeri, are considered nomen nuda because there are inadequate descriptions of their oocysts and their life cycles in the publications on which the names were proposed. Cryptosporidium meleagridis of turkeys and C. baileyi of chickens presently are the only validly named species. It is possible that there is a species which infects bobwhite quail. It produces an oocyst quite similar to that of C. meleagridis. It is currently under investigation because of its ability to produce a generalized intestinal infection in quail in which it may cause severe disease and high mortality.\n\nCryptosporidial infections in birds occur in the conjunctiva, nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, air sacs, proventriculus, small intestine, large intestine, ceca, cloaca, Bursa of Fabricius, kidneys, and urinary tract. Cryptosporidiosis in birds may be a respiratory, enteric, or renal disease. Which symptoms are present, or in rare cases which combinations of symptoms, depends in part on which species of bird is infected and which species of Cryptosporidium is causing the infection (Lindsay and Blagburn, 1990) .\n\nMost studies of cryptosporidiosis of birds have been performed on birds with C. baileyi infections. The life cycle of C. baileyi, which includes the produc tion of autoinfective thin-walled oocysts, is similar to that of C. parvum of mammals . The parasite develops fully within avian embryos of numerous species. It has been serially passaged in embryonated eggs for more than 3 years (see Life Cycle and Morphology). Attempts to grow C. baileyi in cell cultures, however, have been unsuccessful. Cryptosporidium baileyi oocysts from chickens cause infection in turkeys, geese, ducks, and pheasants but they are not infectious for bobwhite quail Lindsay et al., 1986a; Lindsay and Blagburn, 1990) . Since all attempts to transmit C. baileyi to mammals have failed, it therefore is unlikely to be zoonotic. There is, however, one unconfirmed report of a C. baileyi infection in an individual with a deficient immune system (Ditrich et al., 1991) .\n\nCryptosporidium baileyi develops at numerous sites in chickens Lindsay et al., 1986b Lindsay et al., , 1987c Blagburn et al., 1987) . In most cases the site of development is determined by where the parasite is in troduced. In some cases there is extension of infection from the primary site to secondary sites. Oocysts inoculated orally will develop primarily in the Bursa of Fabricius and cloaca, but may develop secondarily in respiratory tissue as a result of contamination by shed oocysts. Intratracheal inoculation of oocysts results in extensive colonization of the respiratory tract, the Bursa of Fabricius, and the cloaca. The infection in the gut may result from swallowing of oocysts which are coughed up following their formation in the respiratory tissues. If chickens are inoculated in the cloaca, most will develop bursal and cloacal infection, although a few will also develop respiratory infection. Infections also have been established in the conjunctiva, abdomen, and gall bladder.\n\nNot all C. baileyi infections result in disease (Lindsay and Blagburn, 1990) . The oral inoculation of oocysts generally does not induce disease. Oocysts in oculated intratracheal^, on the other hand, will usually produce respiratory dis ease in both chickens and turkeys (Lindsay et ai, 1986b (Lindsay et ai, , 1987b (Lindsay et ai, ,d, 1988a Palkovic and Marousek, 1989) . Symptoms consisting of rales, dyspnea, sneezing, and nasal discharge develop 5 to 9 days after infection is initiated. The most common gross and microscopic lesions are air sacculitis with epithelial hyper plasia, mucocellular exudate, deciliation, and lymphocytic inflammation. Bronchopneumonia is a frequent sequel of infection.\n\nChicks inoculated with C. baileyi oocysts orally or intratracheal^ anytime during the 6 weeks following hatching became infected and passed oocysts, yet only those infected before 14 days developed clinical disease. The younger chick ens excreted oocysts sooner, for a longer period of time, and had heavier infections than did the older chickens (Lindsay et ai, 1988a) . Chickens that clear their infections are completely resistant to later challenge (Current and Snyder, 1988) . The serum from recovered chickens contains antibodies specific for a variety of sporozoite and oocyst antigens, yet there is no evidence suggesting that these play a role in limiting or clearing infection (Current and Snyder, 1988) . Attempts made to attenuate C. baileyi by serial passage of oocysts in chicken embryos have not been successful (Lindsay et ai, 1988b) .\n\nInfection with C. baileyi may alter the response to some vaccines. Chickens infected with C. baileyi and vaccinated 7 days later against Newcastle disease developed significantly higher antibody titers and a significantly lower delayed hypersensitivity (DH) response to Newcastle disease virus than did uninfected chickens (Blagburn et ai, 1987) . Vaccination also may increase a bird's suscept ibility to Cryptosporidium infection. Some turkeys, for example, develop crypto sporidiosis 8 days after vaccination with a fowl cholera vaccine. Other than this observation, virtually nothing is known about the influence of concomitant in fections on cryptosporidiosis.\n\nLittle is known about the life cycle of C. meleagridis, the only avianinfecting species of Cryptosporidium other than C. baileyi considered to be valid. Cryptosporidium meleagridis oocysts isolated from turkeys, however, have prov en infectious for chickens and ducks (Woodmansee et ai, 1988; Lindsay et ai, 1989; Lindsay and Blagburn, 1990) . If turkey poults are inoculated orally, they develop infection in the ileum, ceca, colon, cloaca, and Bursa of Fabricius. There has been only one study of the pathogenicity of C. meleagridis (Bermudez et al, 1988) . In this study it was found that oral inoculation of oocysts into 5-day-old poults failed to produce clinical disease.\n\nUnnamed species of Cryptosporidium infect quail. Even less is known of the Cryptosporidium infecting bobwhite quail than of those infecting turkeys. What little is known indicates that the parasite may be pathogenic in quail as enteric disease with mortality occurring in young quail given moderate doses of oocysts (~10 5 ) obtained from other quail. The infection was worse in quail infected with a reovirus than in those not so infected (Guy et al, 1987) .\n\nNaturally occurring cryptosporidiosis in wild birds has been little studied. Prevalence rates of from 5.9 to 27.3%, however, have been demonstrated in flocks in the United States (Lindsay and Blagburn, 1990) . The actual prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection in wild birds is unknown.\n\nCryptosporidiosis may occur in many types of wild birds (Lindsay and Blagburn, 1990) . Respiratory involvement with rales, coughing, sneezing, and dyspnea occurs in wild turkeys, common quail, ducks, pheasants, and budgerigars. Lesions may be variable, ranging from a mild epithelial hyperplasia to a marked hyperplasia, cellular exudation, deciliation, and pronounced inflammation.\n\nEnteric cryptosporidiosis occurs in wild turkeys, bobwhite quail, budgerigars, cockatiels, and lovebirds. Of these wild birds the most severely affected are quail and lovebirds (Lindsay and Blagburn, 1990) . Severe enteric cryptosporidiosis is characterized by intestinal distention with villous atrophy, villous fusion, crypt hyperplasia, and cellular inflammation.\n\nRenal cryptosporidiosis occurs in finches, jungle fowl, and chickens (Lindsay and Blagburn, 1990) . The kidneys of affected birds are pale and enlarged with the epithelial cells lining the ducts and tubules being hypertrophic and hyperplastic. There is inflammation in the interstitial tissues.\n\nNo anticoccidial or other drugs have proven useful in the prevention or treatment of avian cryptosporidiosis (Lindsay and Blagburn, 1990) . Strong disinfectants may be of practical value for control of cryptosporidiosis in small facilities.\n\nTen species of Cryptosporidium infecting various mammals including bovids (C. bovis), ovids (C. agni), felids (C. curyi, C. felis), canids (C. vulpis), rodents (C. m\u00fbris, C. parvum, C. wrairi), lagomorphs (C. cuniculus), and primates (C. rhesi) have been described (Dubey et ai, 1990 ). Only C. muris and C. parvum are currently recognized as distinct and valid species. Many of the named species are no doubt synonymous with C. parvum. Several species first believed to belong to the genus Cryptosporidium on the basis of oocyst morphology have been in validated because recent evidence indicates that the oocysts observed were actu ally sporocysts of Sarcocystis . Cryptosporidium curyi, a species still not considered valid, is unusual in that its oocysts are five to six times the size of C. parvum oocysts .\n\nCryptosporidium muris was the first species of the genus to be described (Tyzzer, 1907) . In addition to its occurrence within the gastric glands of mice, this parasite also has been observed in the stomachs of naturally infected house rats and in the abomasum of cattle (Upton and Current, 1985; Iseki, 1986; Anderson, 1987) . In cattle, C. muris produces little or no clinical illness although infected animals may shed oocysts for several months. There does not appear to be an age-related variation in susceptibility to infection among cattle since both adult and young animals develop infections (Anderson, 1987 (Anderson, , 1989 . Despite the fact that infected cattle are not grossly ill, elevated plasma pepsinogen levels and low weight gains have been observed in infected animals. Abomasal peptic glands may be infected.\n\nCryptosporidium muris, like C. parvum, apparently lacks host specificity. This parasite has been transmitted to mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, and cats (Iseki et al., 1989) . It may also infect man. All of the developmental stages of C. muris are larger than those of C. parvum. Oocysts of C. muris are 7 \u03c7 5.5 \u03bc\u03c0\u03b9. The C. parvum oocyst is 5 \u03c7 4.5 \u03bc\u03c0\u03b9 (Figure 2.22) .\n\nMany of the reports of cryptosporidiosis of mammals are probably of C. parvum, not C. muris, infections. Cryptosporidium parvum occurs in cattle, sheep, goats, various other domesticated and wild ruminants, pigs, horses, cats, dogs, ferrets, raccoons, opossums, rabbits, nonhuman primates, mice, rats, guinea pigs, and squirrels (Dubey et al, 1990) . Undoubtedly, this list is incomplete. Crosstransmission studies of C. parvum from mammals confirm that this parasite lacks host specificity .\n\nIn most mammals infection with C. parvum produces a wide range of clinical signs and pathologic changes. Severe infection is likely to be accompanied by concomitant infection with other enteropathogens. The main clinical sign of C. parvum infection is severe diarrhea with large numbers of oocysts in the feces (10 6 to 107g of feces).\n\nIn most farm animals cryptosporidiosis appears to be more common in young animals than in mature animals. Infection occurs in calves as young as 4 days of age and as old as 4 weeks. Most infections peak 1 to 3 weeks following birth. This pattern has been observed in sheep, goats, and farmed deer. Data are sparse on pigs and horses, but such data indicate an age relationship of infection similar to that in other species but with the infection extending 3 months or longer (Kim, 1990) . Cryptosporidiosis has been observed in companion animals, such as dogs and cats, ranging in age from 1 week to adulthood (Riggs, 1990) . Many of the infected animals were immunosuppressed and were concomitantly infected with viruses or with other enteropathogens which may have affected age-based resistance. Cryp tosporidiosis in nonhuman primates has been reported to occur in juvenile animals (Kovatch and White, 1972; Wilson et al, 1984; Riggs, 1990) . Age is clearly a factor in susceptibility of rodents (Perryman, 1990) . While wild mice of all ages carry infection, laboratory-reared inbred and congenic mice are clearly most susceptible before their third week of life. Infections in almost all mice are self-limiting and do not extend much beyond 4 weeks of age. Neonatal athymic (nude) BALB/c mice (Heine et al, 1984a) , neonatal but not adult mice immuno compromised by drug treatment or by treatment with anti-CD4 or by a combina tion of anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies , neonatal and adult athymic NIH-III mice and NIH-III mice which are severely immune deficient (SCID) (Mead et al, 1991) and adult C57BL/6 mice infected with the LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus (Darban et al, 1991) all are easily infected and develop persistent Cryptosporidium infections.\n\nClinical cryptosporidiosis occurs with particular frequency in farm animals, par ticularly calves, which are also infected with other enteropathogens (Snodgrass et al, 1980; Krogh and Henriksen, 1985; Angus, 1990) . It is difficult to determine which pathogen is responsible for the clinical signs of illness in calves with mixed infections. Cryptosporidium parvum infections occur most frequently in calves that are also infected with a rotavirus, a Coronavirus, enterotoxogenic Escherichia coli-K99+, or a Salmonella. The role of E. coli-K99+ is unclear because there is generally no overlap between infection with C. parvum and the E. coli in neonatal calves. A possible role for nonenterotoxigenic strains of E. coli, Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, a calici-like virus, the virus of bovine virus diarrhea, a toga-like virus, and Giardia and Eimeria in increasing the pathogenicity of C. parvum in calves has been suggested (Angus, 1990). In some instances the C. parvum infection may precipitate illness in calves by one or more of the abovementioned agents.\n\nCryptosporidium parvum infection has been detected in lambs that were also infected with Salmonella typhimurium and nonenterotoxigenic strains of E. coli (Barker and Carbonell, 1974; Anderson, 1982; De las Heras et al, 1987) . Since most lambs develop immunity to E. co//-K99+ and to rotaviruses very early in life these agents are not likely to have any effect on the course of cryptosporidiosis unless they are infected with C parvum before they are 1 week old. Other potential pathogens that frequently occur in association with cryptosporidiosis in lambs include Proteus, Streptococcus faecalis, coronaviruses, and other viruses. The significance of these agents in the pathogenesis of cryptosporidiosis in lambs is unknown.\n\nVarious agents have been incriminated in causing a diarrhea in neonatal goats that is associated with C. parvum infection. These include E. co//-K99+, nonenterotoxigenic E. coli, rotavirus, Coronavirus, and C. perfringens (Nagy et ai, 1984; Card et ai, 1987) .\n\nRotavirus infections and infections with strains of E. coli are common in deer during the first weeks of life when they are also likely to be infected with cryptosporidiosis.\n\nLittle is known about the enteropathogens which may interact with Cryp tosporidium in pigs and horses, although a Salmonella has been found in a foal with cryptosporidiosis (Coleman et \u03b1\u03ca, 1989) .\n\nCryptosporidiosis occurs in cats that are serologically positive and in cats serologically negative for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) (Poonacha and Pippin, 1982; Bennett et ai, 1985) . It also has been detected in cats infected with Cor onavirus and with the coccidian parasites Toxoplasma and Isospora (Monticello et \u03b1\u03ca, 1987) .\n\nCanine distemper virus, Trichomonas, and Giardia infections have been found in dogs coincidentally with Cryptosporidium (Turnwald et ai, 1988) .\n\nVarious parasites have been recovered from healthy macaques infected with C. parvum, while a variety of enteropathogens, including cytomegalovirus, adeno virus, Campylobacter, and Strongyloides, have been detected in immunodeficient macaques (Cockrell et ai, 1974; Blanchard et ai, 1987; Baskin et al., 1988) . Pneumocystis infection was also detected in immunodeficient macaques, implying that the immunosuppressed state of these animals predisposed them to infection.\n\nThe role of concurrent infections on cryptosporidiosis in mice is largely unknown. Chronic infections have, however, been established in adult BALB/c mice by concomitantly giving them high doses of oocysts (10 7 ) and treating them with sulfadimethoxin. Disruption to the normal gut flora by the drug may have been the factor that permitted establishment in them of cryptosporidial infection .\n\nWhat is clear from these observations is that clinical expression of cryp tosporidial infection is more likely if other enteropathogens are present. How the Cryptosporidium interacts with these other pathogens is unclear. While C. parvum is more likely to induce disease when other infections are also present, C. parvum can cause clinical illness by itself. This is apparent as clinical cryptosporidiosis has been produced in gnotobiotic and pathogen-free calves, lambs, and pigs when they were infected with C. parvum (Tzipori et ai, 1981 (Tzipori et ai, , 1982b Angus et al., 1982b; Heine et al., 1984b) .\n\nThe main sign of cryptosporidiosis in most animals is a profuse and watery diarrhea accompanied by the shedding of large numbers of oocysts (Current, 1985; Blewett, 1989; Dubey et al, 1990) . Animals may be dull, anorexic, febrile, and dehydrated, and they may lose condition. Uncomplicated infection rarely causes death.\n\nPostmortem examination may reveal a distended small and large intestine. The intestine may be filled with gas and a watery yellow fluid. Enteritis and colitis may be present. Pronounced changes may occur in the distal small intestine. These changes, which occur where parasite density is greatest, can be detected by microscopic examination. The villous atrophy and fusion which may occur is accompanied by changes in the surface epithelium including formation of cuboidal or even squamous cells. The mucosa is hyperemic and edematous. There is mononuclear and neutrophil infiltration into the lamina propria which also be comes edematous. The crypts often become dilated and hypercellular. Infection may occur in the distal small intestine, the cecum, the colon, and occasionally the duodenum.\n\nPathologic changes caused by Cryptosporidia have been confirmed through the study of infections in gnotobiotic calves or calves infected with sterile oocysts Heine et al, 1984b) . It is, however, not exactly clear how the parasite produces clinical disease. Changes similar to those noted previously occur in animals suffering from most enteropathogenic diseases. It has been proposed that C. parvum produces a cholera-like toxin which induces the hypersecretion seen in animals with severe diarrhea (Current, 1989) . This suggestion has not yet been substantiated. The tremendous numbers of parasites present no doubt inter fere with microvillous function (Figure 2.22 ). In addition, the high rate of cellular turnover accompanying infection probably causes problems.\n\nIt has been suggested that isolates of C. parvum may differ in virulence. Oocysts from Maryland did not always produce clinical disease in calves even with doses of 5 \u03c7 10 6 oocysts, whereas a dose of 10 4 oocysts from Alabama always produced disease in similar calves (Fayer et al, 1985; Fayer and Ungar, 1986) . The validity of these observations could perhaps be confirmed by studies on gnotobiotic calves.\n\nThe clinical forms and pathologic changes in animals with Cryptosporidia are remarkably similar in mammals of all species. The differences that occur are largely a result of differences in the severity of infection or of minor variations in sites of infection.\n\nFairly complete data are available on the prevalence of C. parvum in cattle but there are only a few studies of the prevalence of C. parvum in other animals (Angus, 1990) . Cryptosporidium parvum is distributed worldwide in cattle. Clin ical cryptosporidiosis is most prevalent in young calves. The prevalence of cryp tosporidiosis in cattle varies widely from region to region (Table 2 .4). That C. parvum is a primary enteropathogen of cattle was established in 1980 by field studies which showed C. parvum in the absence of any of the other enteropatho gens known to produce diarrhea in calves (Tzipori et ai, 1980b) .\n\nThe prevalence in cattle of C. muris is less well known than is the prevalence of C. parvum but data available indicate that the parasite is widespread. Data available on ruminants other than cattle suggest that prevalence is similar to that seen in cattle (Angus, 1990) . It was estimated in the late 1970s that cryptosporidi osis caused $6.2 million in losses in calves alone (House, 1978) . This estimate may be low.\n\nCryptosporidium parvum has a loose host specificity. It is not surprising, therefore, that isolates of calf or human origin infect mammals of other species. Under appropriate conditions, cryptosporidiosis is zoonotic. Because of the resistance of cryptosporidial oocysts to many disinfectants and to other factors, oocysts from a variety of sources pose a threat to man. \n\nNumerous case reports and surveys of the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis in man exist (Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Ungar, 1990a) . Cryptosporidiosis is not rare in humans. In the following sections of this chapter a description of the clinical features, pathology, and immune responses of humans to cryptosporidial infection is presented.\n\nThe only species of Cryptosporidium proven to infect humans is C. parvum. Cryptosporidial infections usually result from ingestion of oocysts present in food or water. Infection may also result from direct contact with infected animals, infected humans, or contaminated surfaces. The incubation period in man is from 2 to 10 days. This estimate is based on case reports. Seven days is the most frequently reported period after infection before the onset of symptoms (Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Ungar, 1990a) . A 7-day incubation period is consistent with data on the duration of the C. parvum life cycle in vitro (Current and Haynes, 1984) and in animals (Current and Reese, 1986) . In immunocompetent individuals the duration of clinical illness including diarrhea is from 1 to 3 weeks and oocyst shedding persists for 1 to 4 weeks or more after symptoms are resolved Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Ungar, 1990a) . In 49 patients with symptomatic cryptosporidiosis, a median period of 18 days elapsed between the onset of clinical symptoms and the dis appearance of oocysts from stool specimens (Shepherd et al, 1988) . In the adults of this group (19 patients) the medium period of oocyst shedding was 19 days and in the children (30 patients) the median period was 17 days. The period between the appearance of symptoms and the cessation of oocyst shedding ranged from 9 to 50 days in the children and 11 to 28 days in the adults. Oocyst shedding persists for a period approximately twice as long as symptoms persist , but is quite variable (Anonymous, 1982; Hart et al, 1984; Hunt et al, 1984; Baxby et al, 1985; Shepherd et al, 1988) .\n\nThe prevalence of asymptomatic infections and the duration of oocyst shedding in people with asymptomatic infections are not known. Twelve and seven-tenths percent of bile samples from 169 patients undergoing routine endo scopy, however, contained oocysts. The patients also had oocysts in their stools, but no diarrhea.\n\nIn immunosuppressed or immunodeficient individuals, cryptosporidial in fections are usually chronic, with persistent clinical symptoms and persistent oocyst shedding. The resolution of cryptosporidial infections in patients who are immunosuppressed for therapeutic reasons requires the withdrawal of the immun osuppressive treatments. The resolution of cryptosporidial infections in people who are immunosuppressed as a result of disease such as measles, chicken pox, or cytomegalovirus infection or as a result of malnutrition requires the primary condition to be resolved. Congenitally immunodeficient individuals such as those with hypo-or agammaglobulinemia and individuals with unbeatable or nonresolving immunosuppressive infections such as AIDS generally do not resolve their cryptosporidial infections, although some spontaneous recoveries have been re ported in such individuals (Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Ungar, 1990a) .\n\nImmunocompetent patients infected with Cryptosporidia usually develop mild to profuse, watery diarrhea. The feces rarely contain blood and leukocytes. Other symptoms frequently reported include abdominal cramping, mild fever (<39\u00b0C), nausea and vomiting, neuralgia (headache), fatigue, and anorexia (Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Ungar, 1990a) . The symptoms reported to occur in 586 in dividuals observed in the course of 36 large-scale surveys were diarrhea (92%), nausea and vomiting (51%), abdominal pain (45%), and mild fever (36%); many individuals experienced multiple symptoms . Infections may be particularly severe in newborns and in young children. Diarrhea and concomitant dehydration may cause severe illness and even death in children. Children in poor countries where poor housing and sanitation are com mon and where there is early exposure to pathogenic agents are particularly at risk. Malnutrition is common in people with cryptosporidial infection and may be either a result of infection or a factor in the severity of and susceptibility to infection Smith and Van der Ende, 1986; Sallon et al, 1988; Wittenberg et al, 1989; Janoff et al, 1990) . Transient immunosuppression caused by measles has been considered to be a factor in the severe cryptosporidial diarrhea which may occur in children De Mol et al, 1984; Crawford and Vermund, 1988) . In developed countries, cryptosporidial infections are more common in children who attend child care facilities than in those who do not (Anonymous, 1984b; Taylor et al, 1985; Alpert et al, 1986) . One study of children in child care facilities indicated that cryptosporidiosis with diarrhea was caused by C. parvum and not by other Cryptosporidia .\n\nThe diarrhea caused by cryptosporidial infection in immunocompromised individuals such as those with AIDS is often more severe than that which occurs in immunocompetent patients. This diarrhea is considered to be a cause of death. Infection may extend throughout the digestive tract. Patients with diarrhea may produce stool volumes that exceed 6 liters per day (Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Ungar, 1990a) . One patient produced 17 liters of feces per day (Anonymous, 1982) . Cryptosporidial infection may occur in man in extraintestinal organs and tissues as well as the intestines.\n\nColonization of extraintestinal sites by Cryptosporidia is most common in im munocompromised hosts. Infection of the gall bladder and of the bile duct epi thelium may cause cholecystitis and sclerosing cholangitis in AIDS patients (Pitlik et al, 1983; Blumberg et al, 1984; Hinnant et al, 1989) . Symptoms reported to occur in such patients include fever, nonradiating pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and jaundice. Elevated serum bili rubin and liver enzyme levels have also been observed in these patients along with dilation and thickening of the wall of the gall bladder and of the bile ducts. Diagnosis has been accomplished by histologic examination of biopsy specimens or by the identification of oocysts in the bile. Oocysts may or may not be detected in the stools of such patients.\n\nColonization of the pancreatic ducts may cause pancreatitis in immuno compromised patients (Kocoshis et al, 1984; Gross et al, 1986; Margulis et al, 1986; Kahn et ai, 1987; Schneiderman etal, 1987; Hinnant et al, 1989) . The only case of pancreatic cryptosporidiosis in an immunologically normal individual occurred in an adolescent farm girl. One week after cryptosporidial enteritis was diagnosed, a high serum amylase level suggested that there was pancreatic in volvement. On further study she was found to have ascites and an enlarged pancreas. No etiologic agent other than C. parvum was identified (Hawkins et al., 1987) . Those AIDS patients with pancreatic cryptosporidial infections may also have bile duct and gall bladder infections. A severely immunodeficient infant with cryptosporidial enteritis was found on postmortem examination to have cryp tosporidial organisms on the pancreatic duct epithelium (Kocoshis et al., 1984) .\n\nCryptosporidial infection in the respiratory tract has been reported with increasing frequency. Such infections are most common in immunocompromised individuals (Forgacs et al., 1983; Brady et al., 1984; Kocoshis et ai, 1984; Ma et al., 1984; Milierei al., 1984; Manivel \u00e9tal, 1985; Harari \u00e9tal, 1986; Hojlyngand Jensen, 1988) . Symptoms reported to occur in people with respiratory infections include cough, croup, wheezing, hoarseness, and shortness of breath. There are few reports of the actual demonstration of cryptosporidial organisms on the bronchial mucosa (Forgacs et al, 1983; Kocoshis et al, 1984) . In most cases oocysts have only been detected in sputum, tracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, or alveolar exudates, the latter usually obtained by lung biopsy. It is not entirely clear that the oocysts in these specimens were not aspirated from the gastrointestinal tract. The Cryptosporidium in the respiratory tract of humans is probably C. parvum since avian-infecting species, C. meleagridis and C. baileyi, only infect the respiratory epithelium of turkeys and other birds.\n\nA conclusion that respiratory symptoms are caused by Cryptosporidia is complicated by the observation that most of the patients with Cryptosporidia in their lungs are concomitantly infected with other pathogens such as cytomegalo virus, Pneumocystis carinii, and Mycobacterium. Cryptosporidium was, however, the only pathogen in the respiratory tracts of four AIDS patients with respiratory symptoms (Hojlyng and Jensen, 1988) . Most of the immunocompromised patients who had Cryptosporidia in their respiratory tracts did not survive. While there are many case reports describing patients with Cryptosporidia in extraintestinal sites, there are no reports of disseminated cryptosporidial infection of humans.\n\nPatients with hypo-or agammaglobulinemias, even ones with apparently normal T-cell function, have difficulty resolving cryptosporidial infection. AIDS patients with severe deficiencies in T-cell function also develop chronic infections. Some AIDS patients treated with zidovudine (AZT), however, have improved clinically or have even completely recovered from their cryptosporidial infections (Greenberg et al., 1989; Sogni, 1990) . The drug apparently does not act directly on the parasite, but rather acts by stimulation of the patient's immune system.\n\nImmunosuppression resulting from chemotherapy may permit development of chronic cryptosporidiosis. In those instances where the immunosuppressive treatments are temporarily or permanently discontinued, the infected individuals rapidly clear the infection (Miller et al., 1983; Collie et al., 1984; Lewis et al., 1985; Manivel et al., 1985; Meisel et al., 1976) .\n\nThe forgoing observations and data from studies on animals indicate that both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses are required for the resolution of cryptosporidial infection.\n\nThe humoral responses to C. parvum infection in human patients have been examined by immunofluorescent, immunoblotting, and enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assays (ELISA). Immunoglobulins were detected by immunofluorescent assays in infected tissues as early as 1981 . Im munofluorescent assays have demonstrated that convalescent immunocompetent individuals produce antibody to Cryptosporidia while chronically infected hypogammaglobulinemic patients do not (Campbell and Current, 1983) . Five AIDS patients examined in the same study developed small amounts of antibody to Cryptosporidia.\n\nAn immunofluorescent assay employing whole oocysts as antigen was used in a study of antibody response of immunocompetent patients. These patients had as great as fourfold increases in serum IgA, IgM, and IgE titers to the antigens while IgG titers remained low (Casemore, 1987) . This is the only report of IgE responses to Cryptosporidia in humans. Humans seldom develop IgE responses to protozoan infections (Ungar, 1990a) . Ungar (1990a) proposed that the titers de-tected by the immunofluorescent test were probably a result of reactions with antigens in the oocysts. Immunoglobulin responses to oocysts are usually much poorer than are responses to sporozoites. Such responses to oocysts are often of the IgM isotype while responses to sporozoites are frequently of the IgG or the IgA isotype (C. R. Sterling, unpublished observations) .\n\nSeveral investigators have used ELISA techniques to detect serum responses in patients with cryptosporidial infection Janoff et al, 1990; Laxer et al, 1990) . In both immunocompetent and immunocompromised (AIDS) patients a marked IgG response to cryptosporidial antigens detectible by ELISA occurred within 6 weeks of diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis. Immunoglobulins specific for Cryptosporidia detectable by ELISA persisted for at least 10 months in several of the AIDS patients. IgM generally disappeared from the serum of most patients within 4 months of diagnosis and IgG within 12 months . In the majority of infected Peruvians, however, subsequent studies using ELISA demonstrated that there were persistent IgG and IgM responses . Persistent antibody responses occurred in some U.S. Peace Corps volunteers serving in Africa also . Approximately 14% of the Peace Corps volunteers studied by Ungar et al (1989) seroconverted each year. Filipino children infected with C. parvum had IgM, IgG, and IgA titers significantly higher than the titers which occurred in children from the Clark Air Force Base (Laxer et al, 1990) . The titers in the infected children, which were high during the acute phase of the infection, persisted for 6 weeks which was the duration of convalescence. The fact that the infected children had stable titers probably indicates that they had prior exposure to the parasite. The absence of increases in the antibody titers during the study period makes it difficult to correlate the immunoglobulin responses with the course of the infections. Thai orphans had patterns similar to those which occurred among the Filipino children. The Thai orphans had higher anti-cryptosporidial titers than did children in the United States (Janoff et al, 1990) . These studies infer that individuals from endemic regions may generally have high serum titers to Cryptosporidia which are probably a result of recurrent exposure to the parasite. Such people may be asymptomatic carriers of Cryptosporidia (Janoff et al, 1990) .\n\nThe immunoglobulin responses to C. parvum have also been investigated using immunoblotting techniques (Lumb et al 1988a; Mead et al, 1988b; Hill et al, 1990; Tilley and Upton, 1990; Tilley et al, 1991; Whitmire and Harp, 1991) . Antigens with molecular masses ranging from 3 kDa to over 200 kDa react with immune sera from experimentally and naturally infected animals and humans (Figure 2.17) . A 23-kDa component of Cryptospor idia is recognized by nearly all immune sera. Originally identified as a component of oocysts , it was subsequently found to be present on the surfaces of sporozoites (Mead et al, 1988b) . Immunoelectron microscopy (Lumb et al, 1989) and surface labeling studies (Mead et al, 1988b ) determined the location of this antigen. Ungar and colleagues demonstrated that serum from both immunocompetent and AIDS patients infected with Cryptosporidia reacted with the antigen . Reactivity to the 23-kDa antigen developed within 10 days of infection, peaked in intensity by 3 to 4 weeks postinfection, and was lost within 4 to 5 months of infection (Mead et al., 1988b) . These data support the belief that reactivity to this antigen may be useful for diagnosis of infection.\n\nAt present, the only antigens readily available are those from oocysts and sporozoites (Arrowood and Kilani and Sekla, 1987) (Figures  2.18-2.20) . The sporozoite purification method of Arrowood and has been adjusted for the purification of merozoites from the intestines of infected calves (Bjorneby et al, 1990) . Currently there are no methods for the isolation of trophozoites, meronts, gamonts, or gametocytes, nor for collection of parasite antigens from host cell membranes.\n\nThe diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis in humans and other animals relies less on microscopic examination of stained sections prepared from biopsy specimens than on simple and sensitive assays for the detection of oocysts in stool samples. With this shift in diagnostic methods there has been an improvement in disease detec tion. When stool samples are examined, the entire gut is sampled while when a biopsy specimen is examined, only a small sample of the tissue which may be infected is sampled (Crawford and Vermund, 1988) . The techniques for detection of oocysts in stool specimens may also be used to detect oocysts in bile and in sputum .\n\nStool specimens are usually submitted fresh or in an aqueous preservative medium containing 2.5% potassium dichromate. The oocysts in such specimens may remain infectious for an extended period and specimens should thus be considered a biological hazard. To reduce the danger of handling stool specimens, they should be preserved in 10% buffered formalin or sodium acetate-acetic acid-formalin (SAP) solutions which render the oocysts nonviable. Mercuric chloride-containing preservations should not be used as they interfere with some assays and as mercuric compounds themselves are hazardous (Current and Garcia, 1990) .\n\nPeople with symptomatic cryptosporidial infections usually have substantial numbers of oocysts in their feces and thus oocyst concentration techniques are not needed with such samples (Crawford and Vermund, 1988) . As, however, not all fecal samples from a given patient contain detectable numbers of oocysts, multiple samples should be tested before cryptosporidiosis is ruled out.\n\nWhen attempting to detect asymptomatic infections and in epidemiologic studies, concentration of the oocysts in the stool is of importance. Sheather's sucrose flotation procedure has been widely used by people in research lab oratories, but formalin-ether and formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation is more widely used in clinical laboratories (Crawford and Vermund, 1988 ). Other con centration methods which may be used include zinc sulfate flotation and flotation in saturated sodium chloride solutions (Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Soave and Johnson, 1988) .\n\nThe oocyst flotation and sedimentation techniques are not without problems. If, for example, sedimentation methods are performed using low-speed centrifugation, the cryptosporidial oocysts, which have small size and mass, may become trapped in the ether or ethyl acetate layer and fail to sediment. If this occurs, it may be necessary to increase centrifugation speed and time to recover the oocysts (Current and Garcia, 1990) . Another problem may arise during the time the cryptosporidial infection is resolving. At this time large numbers of non-acid-fast, oocyst \"ghosts\" appear which may not sediment and therefore may not be detected .\n\nIdentification of cryptosporidial organisms may be aided by staining of infected tissues (Figure 2 .22), mucosal scrapings, and gut contents (Tyzzer, 1910 (Tyzzer, , 1912 Slavin, 1955; Panciera et ai, 1971) . Cryptosporidial oocysts may also be demon strated in feces following staining (Pohlenz et \u03b1\u03ca, 1978; Tzipori et ai, 1980a) . Examination of fecal material which has been stained by the Giemsa technique is a better diagnostic technique than is examination of biopsy samples but it un fortunately does not permit differentiation of cryptosporidial oocysts from yeasts and other debris in the feces. In 1981, a procedure based on the Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast staining technique was developed which provided clinical and research laboratories with a simple and effective method for identifying oocysts in stool samples (Henriksen and Pohlenz, 1981) . In feces stained by this method the bright red oocysts are easily differentiated from the blue-green fecal material and yeasts which are always present (Figure 2 .22). The acid-fast staining technique has been modified and improved since its introduction. Garcia et al (1983) introduced a hot acid-fast stain and Ma and Soave (1983) developed a cold acid-fast stain. Bronsdon (1984) , Pohjola et al (1985) , Ma (1986) , and Ma et al (1984) incorporated the detergent tergitol into the system of staining by the cold Kinyoun acid-fast method.\n\nNegative stains have been introduced as alternatives to the systems using the acid-fast methods (Current, 1983; Pohjola, 1984) . A hot safranin-methylene blue stain has also been developed as have fluorescent stains.The fluorescent stains which have been used to stain oocysts in feces include Truant's auramine-rhodamine stain (Garcia et al, 1983; Ma and Soave, 1983) , the auramine-carbol-fuchsin stain (Casemore et al, 1984) , and the acridine orange stain (Garcia et al, 1983; Ma and Soave, 1983) (Figure 2.22) . The fluorescent stains may be better than the nonfluorescent stains but, like all chemical staining meth ods, they are not perfect.\n\nPreparations of fresh fecal samples may be examined under a microscope after they have been stained with iodine. If this is done, however, it is best to confirm the results by use of a more sensitive assay (Crawford and Vermund, 1988 ). Some investigators screen fresh or concentrated fecal specimens using phase-contrast (Figure 2 .22) or differential interference contrast (Nomarski) microscopy.\n\nImmunologic techniques for the detection of cryptosporidial organisms in stool specimens were introduced in 1985 and 1986. An indirect immunofluorescent assay employing convalescent human serum was developed by Casemore et al (1985) for the detection of oocysts and Stibbs and Ongerth (1986) developed a similar test which used antiserum from rabbits immunized with oocysts. Immunofluorescent assays employing oocyst-reactive monoclonal antibodies have also been introduced McLaughlin et al, 1987; Sterling and Arrowood, 1986; Arrowood and Sterling, 1989) (Figure 2 .22). The immuno fluorescent methods are significantly more sensitive and specific than conven tional staining techniques (Arrowood and Sterling, 1989; Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Garcia et al, 1987) . They are widely used in research and clinical lab oratories and they are useful for detecting oocysts in environmental samples Stibbs and Ongerth, 1986; Madore et al, 1987; Musial et al, 1987; Rose et al, 1988 Rose et al, ,1989 Arrowood et al, 1989; Loose et al, 1989; Smith et al, 1989; Smith and Rose, 1990) . ELISAs for the detection of oocysts in feces utilizing oocyst-reactive mono clonal antibodies have been developed (Anusz et al, 1990; Chapman et al, 1990) .\n\nMonoclonal antibodies are used to detect antigens in feces by an antigen-capture ELISA procedure. This assay is capable of identifying Cryptosporidia in fecal samples from people whose infections have been confirmed by immunofluorescent microscopy, but it has produced some false-positive results (Chapman et al, 1990) . Attempts to use an antigen-capture ELISA to determine if micro scopically negative fecal samples contain cryptosporidial antigens have not been successful. The antigen-capture assay is more sensitive than is microscopic ex amination of fecal samples stained by the acid-fast procedure, but is less sensitive than the immunofluorescent procedure (Anusz et al, 1990) . Ungar (1990b) devel oped an indirect, double-antibody ELISA using polyclonal antisera for the detec tion of cryptosporidial antigens in feces but the assay is not as sensitive as the immunofluorescent procedure. A specific and sensitive ELISA would be an at tractive alternative to microscopic examination for the processing of fecal samples obtained from clinics and obtained in the course of large-scale epidemiological studies.\n\nA latex agglutination method has been developed for the detection of oocysts in stool samples. This method employs latex beads coated with antisera from rabbits immunized with oocysts (Pohjola et al, 1986) . This assay has been used to test samples of homogenized stools and gut contents from C. parvuminfected mice. This method is simple to perform and gives results quickly but the test lacks specificity.\n\nThere is no universally appropriate method for diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis.\n\nMost clinical laboratories attempt diagnosis by fecal examination. These lab oratories use acid-fast staining methods on fecal samples and may or may not attempt concentration of the oocysts in the stool. However, immunofluorescent microscopy, which has great sensitivity and specificity, is the method of choice for examination of fecal and environmental samples. There are two commercial products presently available for diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis. MeriFluor Cryp tosporidium is an immunofluorescent assay system based on an oocyst-specific monoclonal antibody that is produced by Arrowood and Sterling Arrowood and Sterling, 1989) . It is marketed by Meridian Diagnostics, Inc.\n\n(Cincinnati, Ohio 45244). A second immunofluorescent assay system based on an oocyst-specific monoclonal antibody is produced by McLaughlin and associates (1987) . This assay is marketed by Northumbria Biologies, Ltd. (Cramlington, Northumberland NE23 9HL, U.K.). Differences in specificity between the two products have been reported. The antibody used in the MeriFluor test reacts with C. parvum, C. meleagridis, and possibly some strains of c. muris (Arrowood and Sterling, 1989; Rose et al, 1989; Smith and Rose, 1990) . The antibody does not react with any of a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, protozoa, and helminth ova . The reagent produced by McLaughlin and associates (1987) reacts with C. parvum, C. baileyi, and C. muris (Rose et ai, 1989; Smith and Rose, 1990 ).\n\nOocyst shedding by most infected individuals is transient, affording investigators a limited window of opportunity to confirm infection by parasite detection. Epi demiologic surveys of the prevalence of cryptosporidiosis should therefore use s\u00e9rodiagnostic methods as well as fecal examination since fecal oocyst detection methods alone will probably underestimate the true number of cases. Serologic methods may identify recently infected individuals if a series of serum samples from each individual is examined. In such samples, seroconversion, a significant increase in anti-cryptosporidial antibody titers, or the identification of antibody responses to certain antigens, may indicate recent infection. Humoral responses to cryptosporidial infections were first assayed by in direct immunofluorescence (IIF) in tests which used infected tissue sections as antigen Campbell and Current, 1983) . Using this technique, Tzipori and colleagues demonstrated anti-cryptosporidial immuno globulins in the sera of mammals of 10 species . This test showed that immunocompetent humans who had recovered from infection developed titers of 1:40 to 1:640. The titers persisted for at least 1 year (Campbell and Current, 1983 ). In the same study, Campbell and Current (1983) demonstrated that hypogammaglobulinemic individuals infected with Cryptosporidium did not develop anti-cryptosporidial immunoglobulins but that all of five AIDS patients infected with Cryptosporidium developed titers of at least 1:40 (Campbell and Current, 1983) .\n\nImmunofluorescent assays have also been developed which use oocysts as antigens Casemore et al., 1985; Casemore, 1987) or mixtures of oocysts and sporozoites (Mead et al., 1988b; Hill et \u03b1\u03ca, 1990) . With the exception of the monoclonal antibody-based immunofluorescent assay for the detection of oocysts, use of the immunofluorescent assays has largely been re stricted to research laboratories.\n\nELISAs for the detection of antibody responses to cryptosporidial antigens have been developed in several laboratories (Ungar, 1990b) . These tests employ antigens prepared from sonicated oocysts (Ungar et ai, 1986; Janoff et al., 1990) ; whole, frozen oocysts (Laxer et al., 1990) ; or oocysts prepared in an undefined manner (Williams, 1987) . These ELISA procedures are more sensitive than immunoblotting procedures . While several investigators have claimed that there is a strong correlation between infection and ELISA titers, others still have reservations about the specificity of these assays (Crawford and Vermund, 1988) .\n\nReactivity with cryptosporidial antigens of sera from individuals infected with other parasites is a problem which may occur with any s\u00e9rodiagnostic assay. We have observed, for example, that monoclonal antibodies raised against Plas modium chabaudi react with sporozoite antigens of C. parvum and that mono clonal antibodies raised against C. parvum cross-react with P. chabaudi antigens in indirect immunofluorescent assays (unpublished data).\n\nWestern blot methods have been developed for the detection of antibody responses to Cryptosporidium using antigens prepared from sonicated oocysts Luft et al, 1987) ; purified, sonicated sporozoites (Mead et al, 1988b) ; boiled oocysts (Lumb et al, 1988a) ; and freeze-thawed oocysts (Hill et al, 1990; Tilley et al, 1990b) . Antigens with molecular masses ranging from 3 kDa, to over 200 kDa react with immune sera from experimentally and naturally infected animals and humans. A 23-kDa antigen has been identified by all immune sera. Originally identified as an antigen from sonicated oocysts , it was subsequently shown to be on the surface of sporozoites by a study employing purified sporozoites as antigen (Mead et al, 1988b) . Immunoelectron microscopy (Lumb et al, 1989) and surface labeling studies (Mead et al, 1988b; Tilley and Upton, 1990) confirmed the location of this antigen. Reactivity to the 23-kDa antigen was demonstrated 10 days after infection. Re activity peaked in intensity at 3 to 4 weeks after infection and was essentially absent after 4 to 5 months (Mead et al, 1988b) . These data suggest that detection of this antigen by immunoblotting indicates recent infection.\n\nThere are few reports of the application of molecular techniques to the study of Cryptosporidium. Preliminary studies have addressed the issue of strain differ ences among C. parvum isolates, species differences between C. parvum and C. baileyi, and the phylogenetic relationship between the genus Cryptosporidium and related organisms.\n\nKaryotypic analyses of the DNA of C. parvum and C. baileyi have been initiated using the relatively new technique of pulsed field gel electrophoresis (Mead et al, 1988a) . Geographically distinct C. parvum isolates were collected from various mammalian hosts: an isolate from humans in Mexico; isolates from cattle in Alabama, Arizona, and Iowa; and an isolate from horses in Louisiana. A C. baileyi isolate from chickens was included to aid species differentiation. At least five bands were produced by field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) of the DNA. The DNA in those bands was estimated to range in size from 1500 to over 3300 kilobase pairs (Figure 2.21) . The electrophoretic patterns of the DNA of the C. parvum isolates were essentially identical. The pattern produced by C. baileyi DNA was readily distinguished from that of the C. parvum isolates. The C. baileyi pattern consisted of at least six bands. The DNA of C. baileyi was in the same size range as that from C. parvum. The similarity of the chromosomal DNA patterns of the various C. parvum isolates produced by electrophoresis contrasts with the high variability of the chromosomal DNA karyotypes among isolates of Plasmo dium falciparum and other protozoa (Kemp et al, 1985; Scholler et al, 1987) . These data reveal that the sequence differences in DNA among the isolates cannot be distinguished by the chromosomal DNA pattern comparisons using FIGE.\n\nThe C. parvum isolates examined in the previous study were investigated by two-dimensional electrophoresis of their sporozoite proteins . The Iowa (bovine), Peru (human), and Mexico (human) isolates were readily differentiated from one another on the basis of electrophoresis of their sporozoite proteins. The Alabama (bovine) and Louisiana (equine) isolates were indistin guishable but were different from the human and Iowa (bovine) isolates.\n\nIn other studies, oocyst wall proteins of Cryptosporidium of three species (C. parvum, C. baileyi, and C. muris) were iodinated and analyzed by Polyacryl amide gel electrophoresis (Tilley et al, 1990b) . Although common proteins were identified in the oocysts of the three species, electrophoretically unique oocyst wall proteins also existed in each species.\n\nThe phylogenetic relationships between Cryptosporidium and other apicomplexans were investigated by the partial sequencing of the ribosomal RNA of C. parvum and other apicomplexans (Johnson et al, 1990) . The analysis of subunit ribosomal RNA (srRNA) sequences did not reveal a close relationship with other Aplicomplexa. The srRNA sequences that were most similar to those of Cryp tosporidium were from Tetrahymena and Plasmodium. These data conflict with the data from recently reported phylogenetic analyses based on ultrastructure (Barta, 1989) . The ultrastructural study linked Cryptosporidium with the eimerine coccidia (Sarcocystis and Eimeria) and not with Plasmodium. The difference between the srRNA sequences of Cryptosporidium and those of other apicom plexans may help explain the failure of anticoccidial agents to control infections by Cryptosporidium.\n\nA. TREATMENT\n\nImmunocompetent individuals with cryptosporidiosis usually have self-limited infections which spontaneously resolve in less than 3 weeks and thus they do not require chemotherapy (Crawford and Vermund, 1988) . The disease in children, which is usually exacerbated by malnourishment and infection and is often ac companied by diarrhea, may persist for more than a month Macfarlane and Horner Bruce, 1987; Cruz et al, 1988; Janoff et al, 1990) . In immunocompetent adults and children, rehydration by consumption of fluids offers some benefit . Clearly, if some form of chemo-therapy which would shorten the course of the disease were available, most immunocompetent patients would benefit from it but none of the chemotherapeutic and antidiarrheal agents tried have provided any clear benefit (Table 2 .5) (Tzipori et al, 1982a; Fayer and Ungar, 1986; Fayer et ai, 1990b) .\n\nImmunocompromised individuals who have cryptosporidiosis may develop life-threatening diarrhea (Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Soave, 1989; Ungar, 1990a ). An effective treatment for such patients is desperately needed. Treatment with amprolium, diloxanide furoate, furazolidone, interleukin-2, and quinine plus clindamycin has provided some relief . Controlled studies of the efficacy of these drugs for treatment of cryptosporidiosis are lacking. There have been inconclusive results from tests of spiramycin, a macrolide antibiotic similar to erythromycin and clindamycin. The favorable responses reported to occur following treatment with spiramycin have included a reduction in stool movement and volume and the cessation of oocyst shedding in some patients (Portnoy et ai, 1984; Moskovitz et al., 1988) . Some patients did experience unfavorable side effects to treatment with this drug. It is not known if concurrent medications were being administered to the patients given spiramycin in these studies (Connolly et ai, 1988; Moskovitz et al., 1988) . Treated patients in two studies of spiramycin were no better off than untreated ones (Anonymous, 1984a; Wittenberg et al., 1989) . Treatments with the somatostatin analogue SMS-201-995, diphenoxylate, and morphine sulfate have not benefitted patients either (Connolly et al., 1988; Cook et al., 1988) . Treatment of a limited number of patients with AZT seemed to confer benefit; both diarrhea and oocyst shedding stopped after treatment (Connolly et ai, 1988) . Diclazuril, a drug active against Eimeria in animals, did not have any effect on cryptosporidial infection in patients with advanced AIDS (Connolly et ai, 1990) .\n\nNo drug tested prevents or cures cryptosporidiosis of animals (Fayer et ai, 1990b) . Prophylactic regimens fail even when drugs are given in high doses (Angus et ai, 1984) . Oocyst outputs, however, are lower in animals treated with amprolium, arprinocid, dinitolmide, salinomycin, and sulfaquinoxaline than in untreated control animals. There are reports from Ireland that amprolium is efficacious for prophylaxis and treatment of calves with cryptosporidiosis (Fitz gerald, 1988) . Arprinocid treatment reduces the severity of infection in neonatal hamsters, but does not control cryptosporidiosis in lambs or mice (Tzipori et ai, 1982a; Angus et ai, 1984; Kim, 1987) . The claim that calf diarrhea can be controlled by halofuginone treatment has yet to be substantiated by carefully designed and controlled experiments (Yvore and Naciri, 1989) . Lasalocid prevents cryptosporidiosis in calves but only when given at toxic levels. This was the result of one study; however, in another study, when administered at twice the dose level used in the first study, lasalocid was effective and had no toxic side effects (Moon et al., 1982; Gobel, 1987) . Alborixin, cyclosporin A, and maduramycin prevent cryptosporidiosis in neonatal mice (Weikel et al., 1986; Fayer et al., 1990b) . The contradictory nature of the results of these studies indicates a need for a thorough evaluation of the drugs used to prevent and treat cryptosporidiosis.\n\nNewly developed systems for production of chronic cryptosporidiosis in adult animals should provide the means to effectively screen drugs for anticryptosporidial activity and to characterize the immune responses that bring about the recovery from infection (Brasseur et al, 1988; Rehg et al, 1988; Ungar et al, 1990a; Mead et al, 1991; Darban et al, 1991) .\n\nThe absence of effective methods of chemotherapy for individuals with cryp tosporidiosis has stimulated a search for other approaches to controlling this infection. The fact that symptoms of cryptosporidiosis stopped in several patients when their immunosuppressive therapy was discontinued indicates a role for the immune system in control of the infection (Crawford and Vermund, 1988; Ungar, 1990a) . Treatments have been designed to exploit this observation. Restoration of competency, by the administration of an extract from leukocytes obtained from calves which had been immunized with Cryptosporidium, for example, has been attempted in AIDS patients infected with cryptosporidiosis. Five of eight patients given the extract in an uncontrolled study were benefitted. These patients had an amelioration in their diarrhea; both stool movement and volume decreased. When the treatment ended, two of the patients relapsed (Louie et al, 1987) . In a subsequent controlled study, six of seven patients given the leukocyte extract responded favorably and five stopped shedding oocysts (McMeeking et al, 1990) . This same product, however, proved ineffective when given to calves before they were challenged with oocysts (Fayer et al, 1987) .\n\nThe results of epidemiological studies in poor countries indicate that chil dren who are exclusively breast fed are protected to a degree from cryptosporidi osis Crawford and Vermund, 1988) . The design of the studies cited in these reports, however, did not allow an evaluation of the factors which might have contributed to the protection of these children. A study to provide information about these factors is currently underway in Peru. The pre liminary results from this study indicate that there is no significant reduction in the infection rate and in clinical symptoms in children who receive mother's milk which has a high anti-cryptosporidial antibody titer (C. R. Sterling, unpublished data) .\n\nThe ingestion of antibody in milk does not protect mouse pups which are allowed to suckle mothers who are immune to Cryptosporidium Arrowood et al, 1989) . Neither calves nor humans who received colostrum from naturally exposed cows are protected from cryptosporidiosis (Saxon and Weinstein, 1987; Current and Bick, 1989) . That anticryptosporidial antibody ingested with milk is the factor protecting breast-fed children is not supported by the foregoing data nor by the observation that almost all newborn calves receive colostrum within hours after birth and yet may develop cryptosporidiosis.\n\nHowever, both prevention of infection and clinical cure of cryptosporidiosis have been achieved in animals and humans by administrating bovine colostrum from hyperimmune cows (Tzipori et al, 1986 (Tzipori et al, ,1987 Fayer et al, 1989a,b; Ungar et al, 1990b) . The colostrum used in these studies neutralizes sporozoites and oocysts in mice (Fayer et al, 1989a; Perryman et al, 1990) . The anti-crypto sporidial factors in the colostrum are confined to the fractions containing specific antibody (IgG^ and IgA) Tilley et al., 1990a) . Studies also have shown that monoclonal antibodies specific for sporozoites and merozoites neutralize them (Arrowood et al., 1989; Riggs et al., 1989; Bjorneby et al., 1990 Bjorneby et al., , 1991 Perryman et al., 1990; Tilley et al., 1991) . These results indicate that antibodies specific for various stages of Cryptosporidia may be useful in treating cryptosporidiosis.\n\nIf transmission of cryptosporidiosis is to be controlled, it is necessary to eliminate or kill the oocysts or to prevent humans and animals from contacting them. The Cryptosporidium oocyst is highly resistant to disinfectants. The oocyst is not killed by many disinfectants at levels commonly used in hospitals and laboratories. The oocyst is killed, however, by 10% formaldehyde, 5-10% ammonia, and 70% to full-strength bleach (Angus et ai, 1982a; Campbell et al., 1982) . Exposure to temperatures below -20\u00b0C and above 65\u00b0C for 30 minutes also has been reported to destroy oocyst infectivity (Tzipori, 1983; Anderson, 1985) . Oocysts used for experimental purposes are routinely stored in a 2.5% K 2 Cr 2 0 7 solution in which they retain infectivity for 2 to 6 months or longer (Current and Haynes, 1984) .\n\nStudies on the resistance of Giardia to chemicals used in treatment of water to ensure that it is safe for drinking have served as models for similar studies on Cryptosporidium. Early work on the ability of sodium hypochlorite to kill oocysts was rather inconclusive because the hypochlorite was tested on oocysts in ma terials such as intestinal homogenates which inactivated the chlorine as it was released (Campbell et ai, 1982; . In such studies Cryp tosporidium withstood exposure to 1-3% hypochlorite for up to 18 hours at 4 and 37\u00b0C.\n\nThe ability of oocysts to excyst and infect is destroyed by exposure for 2 hours to 80 ppm chlorine at 25\u00b0C and pH7 (Korich et al., 1990) . This is a chlorine concentration times time value (C.t') of 9600 for Cryptosporidium. In contrast the C.t' value of Giardia is only 15 under the same treatment conditions (Jarroll et al. y 1981) .\n\nOzone, which is popular as a water disinfectant because of its high oxidative powers, its ability to increase coagulation during sedimentation, and its ability to eliminate bad tastes from water, has proven to be much more efficient in killing oocysts than chlorine. Infectivity of oocysts in clean water is eliminated by treatment with 1 ppm ozone for 6 to 10 minutes (Korich et al, 1990) . This datum provides a C.t' value of between 6 and 10 for ozone. The problem with ozone as a chemical for eliminating oocysts from water is its instability and the resultant difficulty in maintaining high levels of ozone in water for periods of time sufficient to treat water under practical conditions. Preliminary experiments with peroxone, a combination of hydrogen per oxide and ozone, which is effective against bacteria and viruses, have not been any more encouraging than have the experiments in which oocysts were treated with ozone alone (C. R. Sterling, unpublished data).\n\nThe low efficacy of chlorine and of ozone in killing oocysts of Cryp tosporidia indicates that Cryptosporidium is a very hardy parasite (Table 2 .6).\n\nThe results of these studies indicate that disinfection alone is not likely to eliminate Cryptosporidium oocysts from water. Filtration is now receiving atten tion as a means to remove oocysts (Sterling, 1990) . Studies on filtration have been somewhat encouraging as a 4-log reduction in oocyst numbers was accomplished in a pilot plant (Fox, personal communication). Studies of sewage and drinking water treatment facilities have demonstrated that sand filters remove from 91 to 99.8% of oocysts from water. Facilities without sand filters, on the other hand, remove only between 74 and 79% of oocysts (Rose et ai, 1986; Madore et al. y 1987) . These data are very preliminary and are based on studies of only a few plants. The experience at Carrollton County, Georgia, where the water treatment facility used rapid sand filtration and met federal EPA guidelines of operation during a Cryptosporidium outbreak in 1987 indicates that even the best facilities can sometimes fail to eliminate cryptosporidial oocysts from drinking water (Hayes et al, 1989) .\n\nControl measures based on avoidance of contact with oocysts may be difficult, if not impossible, to implement during calving operations (Angus, 1990) . During calving the best method for control of cryptosporidiosis is a combination of disinfection and placing calves in clean housing. Administering hyperimmune bovine colostrum may be helpful but because of the scale of many calving operations, it may be impossible because it is difficult to produce in great quantity. Control of cryptosporidiosis among children may be at least as difficult in many places as is control of cryptosporidiosis in calves. Clearly, new strategies for treatment and control of cryptosporidiosis need to be developed. \n\nResearch during the past decade has tremendously expanded our knowledge of this organism, once considered an inconsequential pathogen of animals. Now that it is widely recognized as an opportunistic pathogen, Cryptosporidium has gained notoriety because it may cause life-threatening infections in AIDS patients and in children in poor countries. Despite the impressive increases in the understanding of this organism, however, much remains to be explored. Areas that need to be addressed include the taxonomic position of this parasite, its relationship to its coccidian relatives, its epidemiology, and its zoonotic potential. It is still unknown if there are isolates which differ in infectivity and pathogenicity. Effective meth ods for the elimination of transmission are still lacking and the role of infection with other agents in the morbidity and mortality it causes is still unknown. The underlying mechanisms of pathogenicity, and the role of immunity in suscepti bility are not yet understood. The mechanisms involved in the development of acquired immunity and suitable methods for cultivation of the organism are not yet known. Suitable animal models of infection are still lacking, as the present meth-ods do not closely mimic infection in humans, especially AIDS patients. The lack of a vaccine against cryptosporidiosis is a major problem. Antigens which could be tested as possible vaccines have not yet been identified or isolated and there is no effective treatment for cryptosporidiosis. Much remains to be done if disease caused by this parasite is to be controlled."}
