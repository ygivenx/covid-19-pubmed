{"title": "Use of Antibiotics for Exacerbations of COPD", "body": "The increase of airway inflammation during exacerbations, which ultimately causes increase of airflow limitation and symptoms, can be triggered by the following factors:\n\n\u2022 respiratory viruses \u2022 bacteria \u2022 persistent smoking \u2022 common pollutants (nitrogen dioxide, particulates, sulfur dioxide, ozone)\n\n\u2022 allergens \u2022 inadequate COPD management or non-compliance.\n\nAECOPDs are frequently triggered by viral upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold. Viruses are involved in 30-50% of AECOPD. The etiology of respiratory viruses is supported by observational studies and in vivo experiments showing characteristic symptoms and lung function changes following low-dose viral infection.\n\nThe most commonly identified viruses are: \n\nA typical AECOPD is characterized by progressive dyspnea, wheezing, cough and increased sputum volume and/or purulence, preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection. If the symptoms are less typical, it is important to consider an alternative diagnosis:\n\n\u2022 pneumonia \u2022 cardiac disease (congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia)\n\n\u2022 exacerbation of bronchiectasis \u2022 pulmonary embolism\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic progressive and irreversible airflow limitation. COPD constitutes a major worldwide health burden. Airflow limitation in COPD is caused by an abnormal chronic inflammatory response to noxious particles or gases and subsequent airway remodeling ( Figure PP10 -1). The primary cause of COPD is tobacco smoke, but the burning of biomass fuels is also considered to be a risk factor. A key feature of COPD is the occurrence of acute exacerbations (AECOPD), defined as a sudden worsening of symptoms beyond the usual day-to-day variation. Exacerbations of COPD are associated with reduced quality of life and accelerated decline in lung function and represent a substantial socioeconomic burden. Therefore, prevention and adequate management of exacerbations should be an integral part of the comprehensive care of COPD patients. \n\n\u2022 central airway obstruction (e.g. centrally located lung cancer) \u2022 pleural effusion \u2022 pneumothorax.\n\nThe assessment of a patient with suspected AECOPD depends on the severity of symptoms and whether the patient is seen in an inpatient or outpatient setting. Careful history taking is important to establish whether the symptoms are typical for AECOPD. Physical examination should at least include vital signs, auscultation of the chest, central venous pressure and inspection of the extremities (pitting edema, signs of thrombosis). If history taking and physical examination are consistent with AECOPD and the patient is not severely ill, one can proceed with outpatient treatment. Hospital assessment is required in case of:\n\n\u2022 severe underlying COPD \u2022 marked increase in symptoms \u2022 symptoms and signs not consistent with AECOPD \u2022 signs of respiratory failure \u2022 failure to respond to initial management \u2022 important co-morbidities.\n\nHospital assessment should include history taking, physical examination, basic hematology and serum biochemistry, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram and sputum culture. Computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography should be considered, since the incidence of pulmonary embolism in patients hospitalized with AECOPD can be as high as 25%.\n\nThe cornerstone in the management of AECOPD is treatment with a short course of systemic corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone 30-60 mg). Treatment with systemic corticosteroids has a beneficial effect on clinical resolution and recovery of lung function. Recent evidence shows that a short course (5 days) and a long course (14 days) of prednisolone are equally effective and that intravenous use is not superior to oral administration.\n\nThe role of antibiotics in the treatment of AECOPD is more controversial. Classic criteria for administration of antibiotics are increased sputum purulence and other signs of infection, such as fever. Furthermore, antibiotics seem to be more effective in the more severely ill, especially in ICU patients. Recent studies have shown that biomarkers such as procalcitonin and C-reactive protein might play a role in the selection of patients for antibiotic therapy. Biomarker-guided antibiotic therapy might yield equal results compared to selection by classic criteria, while facilitating a significant reduction in the use of antibiotics. More evidence is required, however, before biomarker selection can be implemented.\n\nThe choice of antibiotics can be based on previously isolated potential bacterial pathogens from sputum samples or, in case of empirical treatment, on local resistance patterns. The large majority of comparative antibiotics trials were negative, which proves that newer antibiotics such as quinolones are not superior to older antibiotics such as \u03b2-lactam antibiotics or tetracyclines.\n\nTreatment with inhaled fluticasone and salmeterol, or inhaled tiotropium seems to result in a reduction of exacerbations. Guidelines currently recommend a combination of long-acting beta-2-agonists and inhalation corticosteroids in patients with an FEV 1 <50% predicted and in the presence of two or more exacerbations in the previous year.\n\nThe role of maintenance macrolide antibiotics has recently been investigated in COPD. Results show that maintenance treatment with three times a week 500 mg of azithromycin reduces the exacerbation rate in patients with the frequent exacerbator phenotype (>2 exacerbations per year). However, the effects of long-term treatment with macrolides (>1 year) on antibiotic resistance should be carefully monitored.\n\nInfluenza vaccination reduces the risk for admission for pneumonia or influenza infection in the elderly and reduces mortality. Therefore influenza vaccination can be recommended in patients with COPD.\n\nThe role of antibiotics in the management of COPD exacerbations remains controversial and should be reserved for the severely ill, those with signs of infection or patients not responding to initial medical management.\n\nFurther reading available online at expertconsult.com."}
