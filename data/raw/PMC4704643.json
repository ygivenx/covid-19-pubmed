{"title": "Anti-foot-and-mouth disease virus effects of Chinese herbal kombucha\nin vivo\n", "body": "Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infects cloven-hoofed animals and has had\ndevastating consequences in many countries (Gibbens\net al., 2001; Grubman\net al., 2004; Knowles\net al., 2001). Two strategies for its prevention and\neradication have been widely adopted. Mass slaughter of animals at risk of infection has\nbeen used extensively in developed countries but economic factors have made vaccination\nmore popular in developing countries where the prevalence of FMD is high (Li et al., 2010). Most countries in\nthe European Union and North America have controlled the disease by slaughtering\ninfected animals and those that may have been exposed, but it remains endemic in many\nAfrican, Asian, and South American countries (Bayry\net al., 2001). Although the slaughter policy has been\nhighly successful in limiting the extent of outbreaks and eliminating the infection, it\nhas important negative aspects. Notably, because it is not used in conjunction with\nvaccination, the remaining herds have almost no residual immunity and so remain very\nvulnerable to the disease. New infections can therefore spread rapidly, particularly in\ndensely populated areas (Bayry et al.,\n2001). The vulnerability of nominally FMD-free countries and regions is amply\ndemonstrated by the recent outbreaks in Italy, Greece, the United Kingdom, Japan, and\nSouth Korea, among others (Bayry et al.,\n2001; Cottam et al.,\n2006; Ferguson et al., 2001; Muroga et al., 2012; Ryan\net al., 2008; Sakamoto\net al., 2002; Wee\net al., 2004; Woolhouse\net al., 2001; Yoon\net al., 2012;). FMD has been successfully controlled by\nvaccination in many developing countries. However, existing FMDV vaccines have several\ndrawbacks: they are expensive, have a narrow antigenic spectrum, provide only short term\nimmunity, and are very fragile (Belsham et\nal., 2011; Kitching et\nal., 2007).\n\nAlternatives to the slaughter and vaccination strategies for FMD control have been\ninvestigated. These include RNAi-based treatments, in vivo interferon\nexpression technology, the use of synthetic chemical inhibitors, and treatment with\nChinese herbal extracts. RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved\nmechanism of sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing that is triggered by\ndouble-stranded RNA (dsRNA), including siRNA and miRNA, and has great potential for\ncontrolling viral infections (Du et\nal., 2011). Most studies on the use of RNAi to inhibit FMDV\nreplication have focused exclusively on in vitro experiments using\ncellular models (Chen et al., 2004; Chen\net al., 2006; Du\net al., 2011; Kahana\net al., 2004; Kim\net al., 2008; Luo et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2008;), but there have\nbeen a few in vivo studies using large animal models such as swine\n(Chen et al., 2004; Chen et\nal., 2006; Luo et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2008). Interferons\n(IFNs) are the first line of the host's innate immune defenses against viral infection\n(Diaz-San Segundo et al.,\n2010). It has been demonstrated that type I, type II, and type III IFNs\n(IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b3, respectively) are active against many viruses (Basler et al., 2002; Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2010; Martin et al., 2012). A number of studies have\ninvestigated the ability of interferons to inhibit FMDV replication in vitro, and some\nof these have been extended into susceptible animal models such as guinea pigs, swine,\nand cattle. Vector-mediated interferon expression in vivo successfully\ninhibited FMDV replication and protected FMDV-challenged animals in some cases (Chinsanggaram et al., 2003; Diaz-San Segundo et al., 2010;\nMartin et al., 2012; Moraes et al., 2007). The\nbroad-spectrum efficacy of inoculation with combinational interferon-expressing vectors\nas a means of inhibiting FMDV replication in vivo and its ability to\nprotect against FMDV infection in swine suggest that it may be more attractive than RNAi\nas a method of dealing with FMD outbreaks. However, the applicability of\ninterferon-based FMD treatments may be restricted by their somewhat variable and\ninconsistent ability to protect cattle challenged with FMDV, concerns about the health\nof inoculated animals, and the appearance of resistant viral mutants. T-705\n(favipiravir) and ribavirin are synthetic small molecules that inhibit FMDV reproduction\nby targeting a recently-identified pocket of the RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase. Related\ncompounds such as hypericin that are found in Chinese herbal broad-spectrum inhibitors\nof RNA viral infections have been studied as potential inhibitors of FMDV replication\nin vitro (Durk et\nal., 2010; Furuta et\nal., 2009; Sierra et\nal., 2007; Durk et\nal., 2010; Wang et\nal., 2006). Overall, despite the great potential of methods based\non RNAi, interferons, and synthetic inhibitors of FMDV replication, none of these\ntechnologies have yet been proven to be effective at treating FMD in the field. As such,\nthere is still a need for new and more efficient strategies for combating this\ndisease.\n\nFMDV is the type species of the Aphthovirus genus of the\nPicornaviridase family (Grubman et al.,\n2004). Unlike those of other picornaviruses, the FMDV capsid dissociates into\nseparate pentameric subunits of around 12S each at pH values below 6.5 (Brown et al., 1961). The virus is\ntherefore sensitive to acidic conditions and can be deactivated by exposure to low pH\nenvironments (Bachrach et al.,\n1957). This instability is attributed to a cluster of His residues at the\ninterface between the capsid's VP2 and VP3 subunits, which become protonated under\nacidic conditions, weakening the capsid due to electrostatic repulsion (Curry et al., 1995; Ellard et al., 1999). Acids such as\nperacetic acid and acetic acid effectively kill FMDV in vitro. However,\nin vivo acid treatment only inactivates FMDV rather than killing it,\nand has relatively short-lived effects. Acetic acid bacteria belonging to the genera\nAcetobacter and Gluconacetobacter are among the\nmost effective producers of acetic acid in nature and are used to produce vinegar. If\nanimals and their environments were sprayed with acetic acid bacteria as a protective\nmeasure in the event of an FMD outbreak, the bacteria would reproduce and generate\nacetic acid and other organic acids on an ongoing basis, potentially causing long-term\ninactivation of FMD in the sprayed area. Kombucha, a traditional Chinese drink made by\nfermenting sugared black tea with a symbiotic culture of acetobacter and yeast, is\nwidely consumed throughout the world as a medicinal health-promoting beverage (Greenwalt et al., 2000). The pH of\na typical kombucha batch is between 2.5 and 4.6 (Teoh\net al., 2004), which is sufficiently acidic to inactivate\nFMDV in vitro.\n\nMany broad-spectrum antiviral agents have been isolated from Chinese herbal plants. In\nan attempt to improve the utility of kombucha cultures in the treatment and suppression\nof FMDV in vivo, selected cultures were used to ferment aqueous\nextracts of four Chinese herbs known to produce such agents: licorice (Glycyrrhizae\nRadix), Luohanguo (Siraitia grosvenorii), Chrysanthemum (Dendranthema morifolium) and\ntea (Camellia sinensis). All of these plants are known to produce compounds with\nbroad-spectrum antiviral activity and are widely considered to have beneficial effects\non human health. Moreover, they are consumed extensively in China as edible medicinal\nplants. The primary active compound in licorice is glycyrrhizin, which reportedly shows\nbroad-spectrum anti-viral activity against targets such as HIV, the Hepatitis A, B, and\nC viruses, the Herpesviridae family (VZV, HSV-1, EBS, and CMV), Flaviviruses, and\nviruses responsible for emerging diseases such as SARS (Hoever et al., 2005; Kumada\net al., 2002;). Siraitia grosvenorii is a\nvine belonging to the genus Siraitia Merr, in the family Cucurbitaceae.\nIt is endemic to southern China, where its fruit is known as Luohanguo and it has been\ncultivated for several centuries as a source of food and products used in beverages and\ntraditional Chinese medicine. Notably, its fruit is reported to have beneficial effects\nin the treatment of dry coughs, sore throats, extreme thirst, and constipation. The\nprimary active components of Luohanguo are the mogrosides, a group of terpene glycosides\nthat are estimated to be about 300 times as sweet as sucrose (Kasai et al., 1989). The mogrosides produce a sweet\ntaste in Chinese herbal Kombucha prepared using Luohango extracts and have been approved\nfor use as dietary supplements in Japan, the United States, New Zealand and Australia\n(Qin et al., 2006).\nChrysanthemum and green tea contain effective antiviral compounds such as chlorogenic\nacid and various polyphenolics, which can inhibit the reproduction of HIV, HBV, and the\ninfluenza virus, among others (Imanishi et\nal., 2002; Nakayama et\nal., 1993; Xu et\nal., 2008). The inhibitory effects of Chinese herbal kombucha\nagainst FMDV in vitro have been investigated in BHK21 cells and\nsuckling mice. At a 1:4 dilution, Chinese herbal Kombucha was not toxic to BHK21 cells\nbut inhibited the growth and reproduction of 1000 TCID50 of FMDV in BHK21\ncells. Similarly, a 1:2 dilution exhibited no toxicity towards 3-day-old suckling mice\nbut effectively killed 1000 LD50 of FMDV (Fu\net al., 2014). This manuscript describes a series of\nexperiments conducted to better characterize the in vivo activity of\nChinese herbal kombucha mixtures against FMDV in swine.\n\nBaby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium\n(DMEM, GIBCO, Invitrogen Corporation, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-activated fetal\nbovine serum (FBS). The cultures were maintained at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2\nhumidified incubator (Du et al.,\n2011). FMDV isolates of strain O/China/99 (Gen-Bank Accession number\nAF506822) were used for viral challenge in cells and suckling mice (Du et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2004). The\nsuckling mouse-passaged swine FMDV serotype O strain O/China/99, an original and\nstronger challenge strain, was used in swine experiments and was obtained from the\nExperimental Animal Center of Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy\nof Agricultural Sciences.\n\nThe kombucha cultures employed in this work were purchased from the Beiking Food\nResearch Institute and consisted mainly of Saccharomyces pastonanus and Acetobacter\nxylinum (Wu et al., 2004).\nThe kombucha mother culture was grown in a nutrient broth containing 50 g/L of sugar,\n1 g/L of (NH4)2SO4, 1 g/L of\nKH2PO4, and 5 g/L of tea. The resulting culture was stored\nat 4 \u00b0C until required for the preparation of the Chinese herbal kombucha used in the\nexperiments (Murugesan et al.,\n2009). The experimental kombucha was prepared by mixing 50 g of sugar, 1 g\nof (NH4)2SO4 and 1 gram\nKH2PO4, 5 g of licorice (Glycyrrhizae Radix),\n2 g of Grosvenor Momordica (Momordica Grosvenori), 2 g of\nChrysanthemum (Dendranthema morifolium) and 2 g of green tea\n(Camellia sinensis) in 1 L of distilled water. The resulting\nsolution was boiled for 15 min in a sterile conical flask and then left to cool at\nroom temperature for one hour. The cooled solution was filtered using a sterile nylon\nmesh, and the filtrate was inoculated with the Kombucha culture for fermentation.\nFermentation was performed under aseptic conditions and was achieved by incubating\nthe filtered solution with the Chinese herbal kombucha culture at 28 \u00b11 \u00b0C for 7\ndays. The Chinese herbal kombucha prepared in this way was stored at 4-8 \u00b0C until\nrequired for use in experiments. The heavy metal content of the prepared kombucha was\ndetermined using an ICPS7510 plasma emission spectrometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The\nnumber of Colony Forming Units (CFU) of acetic acid bacteria, yeasts,\nEscherichia coli, and Salmonella spp. per unit\nvolume of the fermented kombucha was determined by the National Standard of\nMicrobiological Examination of Food Hygiene of China (GB4789.2-94, China). The pH of\nthe kombucha was determined using an FE20 pH meter (Shanghai Mettler Toledo,\nChina).\n\nApproximately two-month-old healthy landrace swine (weighing 40-60 kg each) were\nacquired from a small swine farm in Zhuanglang County, Gansu province, China. All of\nthe animals were free of FMDV infection, had not been vaccinated against the virus,\nand did not produce antibodies against FMDV. Twenty swine were divided into four\ngroups of five animals each: a positive control group and high, intermediate, and low\n(H, I, and L) kombucha treatment groups. The animals in each group were cohoused in\nseparate rooms. Three days prior to the viral challenge, the body temperatures of the\nanimals in each group were determined. The positive control group was treated with a\nsucrose solution over a 13 day period that began three days before the viral\nchallenge. The solution was prepared by mixing 3.01 of water with 150 g of sucrose\nand 3 g of NaCl. Each animal was treated with 3.0 l of this solution daily, with 2.0\nl being administered orally (i.e. provided as drinking water, with\nno other food offered) and the remaining 1.0 l being administered by spraying the\nanimal's mouth and nose using a 2.5 l plastic sprayer. Similarly, animals in the H,\nM, and L groups were treated with 3.0 l of a Chinese herbal kombucha solution daily\nfor 13 days, starting three days before the viral challenge. The kombucha solutions\nwere prepared by dissolving 150 g of sucrose and 3 g of NaCl in 3.0 l of a mixture of\nwater and the Chinese herbal kombucha stock solution. In the high strength treatment,\nthe Chinese herbal kombucha stock solution was mixed with water on a 1:1 basis; for\nthe intermediate strength treatment, the stock solution was mixed with water on a 1:3\nbasis; and for the low strength treatment, the two were mixed on a 1:11 basis. In\neach case, 2.0 l of the resulting mixture was supplied as food (and thus administered\norally), while the remaining 1.0 l was administered by spraying the animal's mouth\nand nose. After three days of treatment with the appropriate sucrose or Chinese\nherbal kombucha solution, animals in all groups were inoculated with 1000\nSID50 of swine FMDV serotype O strain O/China/99 in 3 mL of PBS by\nintramuscular injection in the ear-root-neck area. After this challenge, the animals\nwere examined daily for clinical signs of FMD, including the formation of vesicles on\nthe mouth and feet. The observations were terminated ten days after the initial\nchallenge, at which point the animals were killed humanely. Blood and serum samples\nwere collected on days 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 after the challenge.\n\nIn order to detect FMDV replication in swine, total RNA was extracted from serum\nsamples and analyzed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Q-RT-PCR).\nFMDV RNA was isolated from serum samples using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according\nto the manufacturer's protocol. The RT-PCR experiments were performed using the ABI\nPrism 7700 sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All\nresults are reported relative to a FMDV-positive serum sample provided by our\ndiagnostic department. The following primers and probe were used: FMDV forward primer\n(5\u2032-CACTGGTGACAGGCTAAGG-3\u2032), FMDV reverse primer (5\u2032-CCCTTCTCAGATTCCGAGT-3\u2032), and\nFMDV probe (5\u2032-TGCCCTTCAGGTACCCCGAGGTAACA-3\u2032) (Alves\net al., 2009). A foot-and-mouth disease virus realtime\nquantitative RT-PCR detection kit was provided by the Lanzhou Veterinary Research\nInstitute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. To confirm specific\namplification, a melting curve analysis of the RT-PCR products was performed\naccording to the manufacturer's protocol. Serum samples were collected 3 days before\nthe viral challenge, and on days 3 and 10 after the viral challenge.\n\nAll swine serum samples were monitored by liquid-phase blocking sandwich ELISA\nperformed according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer of the O-type\nfoot-and-mouth disease antibody liquid phase blocking ELISA kit used - the Lanzhou\nVeterinary Research Institute (LVRI), CAAS National Foot-and-Mouth Disease Reference\nLaboratory of P.R. China (Alves et\nal., 2009; Hamblin et\nal., 1986). Briefly, serum samples were inactivated by heating\nfor 30 min at 56 \u00b0C and then clarified by centrifugation. ELISA plates were coated\nwith the optimal dilution of rabbit antisera against FMDV type Asia-I in\ncarbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6, 1:1000). The plate was then covered with\nsealplate film and allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. After incubation,\nthe plates were drained and washed with PBST by filling and emptying all of their\nwells five times. Duplicate dilution series in PBST were then prepared from each\nserum sample in U-bottomed 96-well plates, with an initial dilution factor of 1 in 4\nand a sample volume of 50 \u03bcL in each well. 50 \u03bcL of a viral solution of a fixed\nconcentration, diluted in PBST (1:5), was then added to each well and the plate was\nshaken. The addition of the antigen thus increased the initial dilution factor of the\nserum samples to 1 in 8. As controls, each plate also featured four wells containing\nonly the virus diluted in PBST and positive serum, and four containing the virus\nsolution plus negative serum. 50 \u03bcL of each serum/virus mixture was then transferred\nfrom the carrier plate to an ELISA plate, which was then covered. After washing, 50\n\u03bcL of a guinea-pig antiserum solution against FMDV type Asia-I, at a dilution factor\nof 1:1000, was added to each well. The plates were then washed and 50 \u03bcL of rabbit\nanti-guinea-pig immunoglobulin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added to each\nwell, diluted 1:1000 in PBST. The plates were washed and 50 \u03bcL of an\no-phenylenediamine solution containing H2O2 (3%W/V) was added to each well. The\nensuing reaction was stopped after 15 min by adding 1.25 M H2SO4. The plates were\nthen read spectrophotometrically at 492 nm.\n\nA small outbreak of foot and mouth disease occurred in 2010, affecting cattle herds\nowned by 21 farmers; in total, there were 582 cows that did not exhibit FMD symptoms\nwithin the outbreak area. This was used as an opportunity to test the utility of\nChinese herbal kombucha treatment in controlling an FMD outbreak in the field. Based\non the results obtained in vitro and in animal experiments, a 1:4\ndilution of the kombucha stock solution was used in these studies. The 582 cows that\ndid not exhibit FMD symptoms at the start of the trial were divided into two groups:\nan experimental group consisting of 314 cattle belonging to 10 farmers and a control\ngroup consisting of 268 cattle belonging to 11 farmers. The mouths and noses of the\nexperimental group were sprayed with the diluted kombucha mix on a daily basis for\nsix days, at a rate of 200 mL per day per animal. The control group was sprayed with\nthe same volume of a 0.5% peracetic acid solution. After two weeks, the number of\nanimals in both groups showing signs of FMD was determined.\n\nResults are reported as means \u00b1 SD. The significance of differences between results\nfor different groups were evaluated using one-way ANOVA with a p-value threshold of\n0.05.\n\nThe Chinese herbal kombucha was prepared by fermenting Chinese herbal extracts with a\nkombucha culture that was rich in acetic acid bacteria and yeasts. Details of its\ncomposition are provided in Table 1.\nImportantly, the E. coli and heavy metal (e.g.\nmercury, lead, and arsenic) contents of the kombucha were within the limits specified\nin China's national standards for agricultural microbial agents (GB 20287-2006 GB).\nMoreover, the animal pathogen Salmonella spp. was not detected in\nany of the kombucha batches. The herbal kombucha had a very low pH of 2.75,\nsuggesting that the symbiotic micro organisms in the kombucha culture retained their\nstrong acid-forming activity. However, the levels of acid bacteria and yeast in the\nkombucha are relatively low compared to those of other probiotic species, whose\ngrowth would be inhibited by the Chinese herbal extracts it contains. Consequently,\nit was not possible to fully evaluate the kombucha stock solution against the Chinese\nnational standards for agricultural microbial agents (GB 20287-2006).\n\nBefore the viral challenge, swine in the experimental groups treated with Chinese\nherbal kombucha and in the control group were apparently healthy and exhibited no\nobvious clinical symptoms. The kombucha dosages applied to the experimental groups\nwere chosen on the basis of preliminary experiments in sucking mice. After three days\nof pre-treatment with either Chinese herbal kombucha or a sucrose solution as\nappropriate, the swine were challenged with 1000 SID50 of the type O\nstrain O/China/99 of the FMD virus. All of the control group animals (which were\ntreated with a sucrose solution) exhibited the major clinical signs of FMD, including\nvesicle formation and diarrhea, within 3-4 days of being challenged, and one animal\n(no.1765) died from the infection (Table 2).\nSwine treated with the highest tested dose of Chinese herbal kombucha were not\nprotected at all, and all animals in this group exhibited clinical symptoms within\n2-3 days of being challenged. Only one of the animals treated with the intermediate\ndose of Chinese herbal kombucha was completely protected. However, three of five\nanimals pretreated with the lowest dose of Chinese herbal kombucha developed none of\nthe typical clinical symptoms such as vesicles. The lowest dose was thus the most\neffective of the tested treatments for FMDV in swine.\n\nTo assess the level of viral inhibition, blood samples from swine in the experimental\nand control groups were collected and analyzed by qRT-PCR to determine the number of\nFMDV genome copies they contained. None of the samples collected before the viral\nchallenge contained any copies of the FMDV genome (Table 3). After the viral challenge, samples from the intermediate dose\ngroup contained the highest levels of FMDV. Samples from the high dose group\ncontained higher levels of FMDV than did those from the control group, and the lowest\nviral loads were encountered in the low dose group. These results suggest that\nChinese herbal kombucha has a dual effect on FMDV replication, stimulating its\nreproduction at high doses but inhibiting it at lower doses. At low doses, Chinese\nherbal kombucha efficiently inhibits FMDV replication in swine: samples from two\nanimals in the low dose group contained no detectable viral genome copies. Treatment\nwith Chinese herbal kombucha thus completely inhibited FMDV replication in the three\nasymptomatic animals from the low dose group and the single asymptomatic animal from\nthe intermediate dose group. These results are consistent with those presented in\nTable 3. As shown in Table 4, one-way ANOVA indicated that the numbers of RNA virus\ncopies in blood samples collected from the low dosage group on the first day differed\nsignificantly from those for the positive control (C) group, further demonstrating\nthat treatment with Chinese herbal kombucha at appropriate and practical dosages can\neffectively prevent the replication of the foot-and-mouth disease virus in\nvivo. However, there were no significant differences between the\ntreatment groups on days 4-7. Thus, while the herbal kombucha treatment efficiently\ninhibited FMDV replication during the primary stage, it was less effective during the\nadvanced stages of infection.\n\nSerum samples were collected on the day of the viral challenge and also 3 and 10 days\nafterwards to test for the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Samples contained\nFMDV-specific antibodies at 1 or 3 days post-challenge (Table 5). Animals in the control groups treated with the sucrose\nsolution developed clinical signs at 3-4 days post-challenge and exhibited a strong\nneutralizing antibody response at 10 post-challenge, suggesting exposure to very\nlarge amounts of FMDV. Because the high and intermediate does of Chinese herbal\nkombucha stimulated FMDV reproduction in vivo, very strong\nneutralizing antibody responses were detected in animals treated with these doses.\nSurprisingly, however, strong responses were also observed in samples taken from\nanimals treated with the low dose of Chinese herbal kombucha, which did not exhibit\nFMD symptoms and whose serum samples contained few copes of the FMDV genome.\nStatistical analysis (ANOVA) indicated that there were no significant differences\nbetween the antibody responses of any of the tested groups. It therefore seems that\nwhile treatment with low doses of Chinese herbal kombucha prevented the replication\nof the FMD virus, it did not prevent the production of neutralizing antibodies.\n\nAfter two weeks, none of the animals in the experimental group exhibited symptoms of\nFMDV whereas 155 control group cows belonging to 4 different farmers did. Animals in\nthe experimental group were thus completely protected by spraying with Chinese herbal\nkombucha. These field results clearly demonstrate the potential of Chinese herbal\nkombucha as a probiotic treatment for the prevention and containment of FMD\noutbreaks.\n\nChinese herbal kombucha is prepared from two components: the kombucha culture and\nChinese herbal extracts. The Chinese herbal kombucha used in this work had a pH of\nbetween 2.75 and 4.5, meaning that it was sufficiently acidic to kill FMDV directly. It\ntherefore seems likely that some of the protective effects of kombucha treatment as\nobserved in vitro are simply due to its organic acid content (Fu et al., 2014). However, the\norganic acid content of the kombucha used in this work would not be sufficient to\nsubstantially reduce the blood pH of the animals used in the in vivo\nexperiments and the field trial presented herein, and therefore cannot explain the\nobserved protective effects of kombucha treatment.\n\nInstead, it is likely that either the microorganisms present in the kombucha or active\ncomponents of the Chinese herbal extracts it contains are responsible for the\nsuppression of FMDV replication in treated animals. When administered by intramuscular\ninjection in swine, low doses of Chinese herbal kombucha conferred significant\nresistance to FMDV infection. Intermediate doses of kombucha conferred limited\nresistance, while high doses conferred no resistance. Similar trends were observed for\nthe yields of FMDV RNA in blood samples taken from swine treated with kombucha and then\nexposed to FMDV. These results may indicate that kombucha treatment promotes viral\nreplication at high doses but suppresses it at low doses. It is therefore important to\ndetermine the optimal dose for use in field trials before attempting to use kombucha to\nsuppress FMDV outbreaks.\n\nAt present, the mechanism by which Chinese herbal kombucha exerts its antiviral effects\nremain unclear, and further research in this area will be required. The successful use\nof Chinese herbal kombucha to suppress an FMD outbreak in the field may indicate that\nthe Chinese herbal extracts it contains have some antiviral activity that prevents FMDV\nreplication in vivo. Based on the difference between the results\nobserved in the experiments with swine and those observed in the field trial using\ncattle, it appears that Chinese herbal kombucha is more effective at preventing FMDV\ninfections in cattle. It is possible that there is only one mechanism by which kombucha\ninhibits FMDV replication in swine but that there are additional such mechanisms\noperating in cattle (Figure 1). Since Chinese\nherbal kombucha is capable of directly inactivating FMDV in vitro, it\nis likely that simply spraying the kombucha mixture on the cattle would provide a first\nline of defense by effectively disinfecting the animals and their environment. Second,\nin the field trial, the kombucha was administered directly onto the cows\u2019 respiratory\nand digestive tracts by spraying it into their mouths and noses. The acetic acid\nbacteria and yeast in the Chinese herbal kombucha may be able to survive in the animal's\ndigestive and respiratory tracts, where they would reproduce and produce organic acids.\nTogether with the Chinese herbal extracts in the kombucha, this production of acids may\ncontribute to the inactivation of FMDV or the suppression of its replication, providing\na second line of defense. Finally, if some quantity of the virus were to enter into the\nanimal's circulatory system, its reproduction could be inhibited by any active\ncomponents of the Chinese herbal kombucha circulating in the animal's blood, thereby\nproviding a third line of defense. The results obtained in this work provide evidence\nfor the existence of the first and third lines of defense. Moreover, the successful\nfield trial provides some support for the existence of the second. The large scale field\ntrial of treatment with Chinese herbal kombucha as a preventative treatment for FMD in\ncattle was conducted in 2011 (see the supplementary material) while the small scale\nexperiments on the use of Chinese herbal kombucha were conducted between 2010 and 2012\non three small farms (see the supplementary material). All of these clinical\ninvestigations suggested that spraying with Chinese herbal kombucha may be an effective\nmethod for preventing and controlling FMD.\n\nAt present, there are five main strategies used to control FMD: slaughter, vaccination,\nRNAi technology, interferon-based approaches, and methods based on the use of synthetic\ninhibitors of FMDV replication (Diaz-San Segundo\net al., 2010; Du\net al., 2011; Durk\net al., 2010; Basler\net al., 2002; Furuta\net al., 2009; Li\net al., 2010; Martin et al., 2012; Sierra et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2006). Spraying with\nChinese herbal kombucha has a number of advantages relative to all of these strategies\n(Figure 1). First, Chinese herbal komubucha\nspraying protects against FMDV infection in several ways as a result of the inhibitory\neffects of organic acids on viral replication and the potential antiviral effects of the\nChinese herbal extracts used in its production. Second, Chinese herbal komubucha\nspraying kills or inhibits FMDV both within the animal and in its environment, and\nin vitro experiments have shown that some microorganisms in the\nkombucha culture (acetic bacteria and yeast) continue reproducing after application,\nproducing acids and killing or inhibiting the reproduction of FMDV. Third, kombucha is\nlikely to have broad spectrum antiviral activity against FMDV because its mechanisms of\ninhibition stem from its organic acid content and various active compounds produced by\nfour different plants. As such, it is unlikely that any FMD mutant would be resistant to\nall of its effects. Fourth, herbal kombucha treatment can be used as a routine\nprotective or preventative measure against FMD infection but is also suitable for use in\nemergencies. At present, only developed countries use large scale slaughter to deal with\nFMD infections. However, in the long term, many developing countries such as China would\nlike to abandon the vaccination approach and instead use slaughter to establish FMD-free\nregions. Spraying with Chinese herbal kombucha represents a non-vaccination strategy\nthat can prevent FMD and could thus be useful for suppressing outbreaks of the disease\nduring the transition from vaccination to slaughter as the preferred strategy. In\nFMD-free countries that do not use vaccination, Chinese herbal kombucha spraying could\nbe used to help control FMD outbreaks and minimize the need for slaughter, especially in\ncountries with high animal feeding densities such as Japan and South Korea. By using\nkombucha spraying in conjunction with slaughter and vaccination, it may be possible to\nestablish large FMD-free regions around the world, significantly increasing global food\nsecurity."}
