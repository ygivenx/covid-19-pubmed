{"title": "", "body": "Your Editorial (May 9, p 1578) 1 is critical of the Health Protection Agency's (HPA's) communications with health professionals during the initial stages of the swineorigin infl uenza outbreaks in the UK. Relevant algorithms to assist health professionals to deal with suspected cases have been on the HPA website during all the avian infl uenza outbreaks in recent years and were reworked immediately offi cials became aware of the new H1N1 strain of the virus.\n\nSuch guidance was produced to support health professionals in their recognition, investigation, and initial management of patients who had travelled to aff ected areas and might have been at risk. Practical information was (and continues to be) included in the algorithms, which have in general been well received. However, to reinforce this information, the HPA worked with the Royal College of General Practitioners to prepare some specifi c practical guidance on management of patients with swineorigin infl uenza, on April 30, which was cascaded to general practitioners and was immediately published on the HPA website. This practical guidance is very clear on what action needs to be taken and how to access antivirals, as well as providing a full list (with contact details) of all Health Protection Units across England in addition to that already available on the HPA website.\n\nThe HPA is continuing to provide detailed information on swine-origin infl uenza for health professionals through its website and through close working with the Department of Health. The HPA is also indebted to, and grateful for, all the support received from professional bodies (and of course their members), as well as all the assistance off ered during these demanding times. this rapidly instituted service, we feel its planning and execution by clinical and laboratory staff and public health teams, much of it outside regular working hours and with 4-6 h turnaround times, in addi tion to routine service provision, has been a substantial achievement.\n\nWe are co-chairs of the UK Clinical Virology Network. With reference to your Editorial \"Preempting a pandemic-fact or fi ction?\", 1 we feel that we ought to mention the unprecedented preparation in the UK over the past few years-a collaboration between the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and the UK Clinical Virology Network (UKCVN)-to ensure the provision of a wide range of molecular-based assays for the rapid diagnosis and typing of infl uenza A and B infections. The UKCVN is a federation of laboratories in the UK and Ireland that share reagents, in-house assay protocols, and best practice in addition to being a medical and public educational resource. Updates of assays that detect H5N1 avian infl uenza, swine-lineage infl uenza A (H1N1), and seasonal infl uenza A strains had been rolled out by the HPA Centre for Infections Virus Reference Laboratory to HPA regional laboratories. After the concerns surrounding the potential for an avian infl uenza H5N1 pandemic, UKCVN specialist virology centres in the UK and Ireland have been running these assays regularly to ensure out-of-hours availability in an emergency situation.\n\nAdvice on sample collection, transport medium, obtaining test kits, and transport of samples by courier to the laboratories was already in place. Many specialist virology centres were able to provide a diagnostic infl uenza A service and could type the virus as seasonal infl uenza H1, H3, or \"untypeable\"; the latter most likely to be swine-lineage infl uenza A (H1N1) virus. The HPA Centre for Infections Virus Reference Laboratory confi rmed swine-lineage infl uenza A (H1N1) by sequence analysis and has validated a confi rmatory test for use by other laboratories.\n\nAlthough lessons have been learnt that could strengthen the running of in what ways and to what extent can states limit or deny human rights and freedoms when infectious disease outbreaks occur, especially when they are novel and poorly understood?\n\nPublic health emergencies such as infl uenza A (H5N1 and H1N1), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and bioterrorism require rapid, rational, eff ective, and proportionate responses. A minimalist response might fail to prevent or mitigate the health threat, whereas a maximalist, disproportionate one could have long-lasting negative eff ects on community trust, public services, social order, and the economy.\n\nThe UN Economic and Social Council adopted a set of principles in 1984 addressing the legitimacy of limitations and derogations on human rights in the context of public health emergencies. 2 The Siracusa Principles stipulate that any restriction should be in accordance with the law; in the interest of a legitimate objective; strictly necessary; the least intrusive or restrictive means available; neither arbitrary nor discriminatory; www.thelancet.com Vol 373 June 20, 2009 and subject to review. More recent (binding) guidance on restrictions of civil and political rights in the context of public health emergencies emphasises that restrictions be strictly limited and justifi ed by the state. 3 Human rights norms are essential for the protection of both individuals and communities in times of public health emergencies. 4,5 Uncertainties about the epidemiology of emerging infectious diseases and the eff ectiveness of control strategies complicate assessment of the legitimacy of rightslimiting measures, and highlight the importance of transparent decisionmaking processes.\n\nAs they move swiftly to confront H1N1, national and international authorities must respect international human rights law, and look to the Siracusa Principles for guidance. Their application will not only avoid counterproductive antagonism but create a desirable synergy between sound public health, human rights, and bioethics.\n\nWe declare that we have no confl icts of interest. \n\nIn the response to the emergence of a novel H1N1 infl uenza virus and its subsequent spread worldwide, we would like to ensure that existing global health priorities are not neglected.\n\nTuberculosis is a respiratory pandemic priority, aff ecting an estimated 9\u00b727 million people and killing 1\u00b777 million worldwide in 2007. 1 Multidrug -resistant tubercu losis (MDR-TB; 511 000 cases, 150 000 deaths estimated in 2007) has a case-fatality rate of 294 per 1000 aff ected individuals, and extensively drug-resistant tubercu losis (XDR-TB; 50 000 cases and 30 000 deaths estimated in 2007) has a case-fatality rate of 600 per 1000 aff ected cases. 2 This means 1\u00b713 daily deaths in Mexico and 0\u00b71 in the rest of the world for infl uenza H1N1 and 410\u00b79 and 82\u00b72 daily deaths, respectively, for MDR-TB and XDR-TB. In the given situation, vigi lance is important but the fi ght against the true priorities should continue.\n\nWhile the media reported extensively on the novel infl uenza virus, WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped using the term \"swine fl u\" to prevent the collapse of the swine products market, WHO declared phase 5 (the current defi nition does not consider mortality), and the World Health Assembly was shortened, rescheduling and then reintroducing the planned discussion on the MDR-TB emergency. It seems that under media pressure, the scientifi c community has lost its capacity to keep priorities in check and to manage the new challenge in a collaborative and non-vertical manner.\n\nThe global tuberculosis network is composed, largely, of pulmonologists and infectious disease and public health specialists, well distributed around the world, and covering urban as well as rural territories. This network is able to support infl uenza control specialists in implementing eff ective prevention, diagnosis, and, when necessary, treatment of the novel H1N1 infl uenza virus infection.\n\nMuch ink and paper has been and will be devoted to discussing this burning is sue. Our contribution is mainly focus ed at calling for a wiser use of the available surveillance data. Public health inter ventions should be guided by facts (not by emotions), and should always take their costeff ectiveness into account."}
