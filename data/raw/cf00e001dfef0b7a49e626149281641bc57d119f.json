The isotypes of the MAbs were determined and dard procedures with a protein sequencer (Model 476A; Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). are shown in Table 1 . To define the epitopes recognized blotting with the K3 and F10 fusion proteins but not with ent HeLa-CD13 cells at an m.o.i of 10 PFU per cell, harvested the cells at different times after infection, produced cell lysates, and analyzed them by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the panel of MAbs described above. A protein with an apparent molecular mass of 105 kDa was specifically detected by MAb 8.6G5 in lysates from infected, but not from mock-infected, cells (Fig. 2) . Using this approach, the earliest time point at which the 105-kDa polypeptide could be detected was 7 hr after infection. The 105-kDa polypeptide was recognized by all of the available pp1ab-specific MAbs but not by a b-galactosidase-specific control MAb 6D2H4 (data not shown; Ziebuhr et al., 1995) . Since three of the antibodies used in the immunoblot experiments differ in their specificity, the experiments show that the 105-kDa protein must contain, at least, amino acids 4129 to 4228 of the 1ab polyprotein.\n\nTo define the termini of the 105-kDa protein we de- age site, the dipeptide bonds Gln-4068/Ser-4069 and Gln-4995/Ala-4996, respectively (Gorbalenya et al., 1989; .

This sequence is located at amino acid positions 4123 to 4141 in pp1ab. MAb 7.12G4 reacted with two of the same peptides. MAb 8.3E4 showed binding activity with two consecutive peptides encompassing the sequence SRQDLTKYTMMDLCFA, i.e., amino acid positions 4177 to 4192 in pp1ab. The binding site for MAb 8.6G5 was located within the sequence TDYFEMKNWFDPIENEDIH, which is represented by three neighboring peptides in the library and corresponds to pp1ab amino acids 4216 to 4234. The amino acid sequences of the peptides recognized by individual antibodies, as well as their position in the HCV 229E polyprotein 1ab, are summarized in Table 1 and their locations are indicated in Fig. 2 . cleaved into two polypeptides with apparent molecular the pMal-Npol fusion protein, containing the predicted N-terminal cleavage site of the polymerase domain with masses of 20 and 16 kDa.

Incubation of the purified fusion proteins with to be Ser-Phe-Asp-Asn-Ser-Tyr-Leu, representing amino acids 4069 to 4075 of HCV 229E pp1ab, and the N-termi-3C-like proteinase was then used to obtain specific proteolytic reaction products. Thus, as is shown in Fig. 4 , nal protein sequence of the 28-kDa (pMal-Cpol) cleavage product was determined to be Ala-Ala-Gly-Leu-Cys-Val-Val, representing amino acids 4996 to 5002 of the HCV 229E 1ab polyprotein . These data show that two 3C-like proteinase-mediated cleavages, at dipeptide bonds Gln-4068/Ser-4069 and Gln-4995/Ala-4996, release the putative RNA polymerase domain from the HCV 229E 1ab polyprotein in the form of a 926-aminoacid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 105.5 kDa.\n\nIn this study, we have identified, in virus-infected cells, a 105-kDa viral polypeptide that is encoded in the HCV 229E ORFs 1a and 1b. The identity of the polypeptide has been established by reactivity with monoclonal antibodies of defined specificity. We have also shown that the 105-kDa polypeptide is released from the gene 1encoded polyprotein precursor, pp1ab, by cleavage at the dipeptide bonds Gln-4068/Ser-4069 and Gln-4995/ Ala-4996, a reaction that is mediated by the HCV 229E 3C-like proteinase.\n\nThe detection of coronavirus gene 1-encoded polypeptides in the virus-infected cell is proving to be a laborious task. The results shown here, and our previous work on the expression of the HCV 229E 3C-like proteinase (Ziebuhr et al., 1995) , indicate that, at least in the early stages of infection, these proteins are present in the cell in exceedingly low amounts. Indeed, the data suggest that it is only possible to detect polymerase translation products after the infection has progressed into the phase of genomic and subgenomic mRNA amplification. Also, as may have been predicted from in vitro studies on the level of HCV 229E mRNA 1 ribosomal frameshifting , we have found it more difficult to identify pp1ab-derived products compared to those derived from pp1a. For example, our attempts to immunoprecipitate the 105-kDa polypeptide using polyclonal antiserum, an approach which has proven successful for the detection of the HCV 229E 3C-like proteinase, have failed to produce convincing results. Obviously, if it is only possible to detect stable translation products as they accumulate in the virus-infected cell, it is going to be difficult to obtain detailed information on the expression and processing of the HCV 229E 1a and 1ab polyproteins. On the basis of the data obtained so far, a quantitative comparison of the amounts of ORF 1a-encoded (Ziebuhr et al., 1995) and ORF 1b-encoded polypeptides is, in our opinion, not possible. For example, the characteristics of the primary and secondary antibodies and the immunological assays that have been used in these studies are very different. Also, the genesis of gene 1-encoded polypeptides involves proteolytic processing, and we do not have any data on the kinetics of this process. Finally, there is no information concerning nor have any protein-protein interactions that might in-and are not recognized as cleavage sites in the trans cleavage assays. terfere with antibody recognition been investigated.\n\nThe processing of the 105-kDa protein is mediated The 105-kDa polypeptide contains an RNA polymerase motif that has been identified by computer-aided sequence by the HCV 229E 3C-like proteinase. Information on the substrate specificity of coronaviral 3C-like proteinases is comparisons with a variety of related cellular and viral enzymes (amino acids 4606 to 4908 of HCV 229E polyprotein limited, but comparison of the four cleavage sites that have been determined by sequence analysis to date (Ta-1ab; Gorbalenya et al., 1989; . This suggests that this polypeptide will have a central role in the ble 2; Lu et al., 1995; Ziebuhr et al., 1995) suggests that, besides conservation at the P1 and P1 sites (Gln/Ala, replication and transcription of viral RNA.

The presence of Ile at the P2 ated with, for example, bacterially expressed 105-kDa polypeptide are in progress. However, even if, for example, a site of the HCV 229E amino-terminal polymerase cleavage site indicates, however, that a certain variability is poly(A)-dependent oligo(U)-primed poly(U) polymerase activity could be demonstrated for this polypeptide, this would allowed at this position. It is likely, therefore, that different hydrophobic residues, present at the analogous position still represent only one of the many gene functions required for virus replication.
