{"title": "", "body": "A seroepidemiological study for detection of antibody to hatman coronaviruses OC43, 229E, and neonatal calf diarrhea coronavirus (NCDCV), has been carried out using sera collected from hospitalized patients or healthy persons through routine laboratory tests in Northern Italy. Patients tested were children and adults with different pathological diseases. Antibody detection was performed by using an indirect immunoperoxidase staining technique (gor all viruses) and, in the case of OC43 and NCDCV, antibody detection was obtained even with a ,hemagglutination inhibition test and a plaque reduction neutralization assay. Results obtained show a significant difference in the prevalence of antibody to 229E bet~Teen children and adult group. Furthermore, a different tirer was observed, within the two groups, between patients affected by hematological diseases (leukemia) and patients w&h other diseases. Finally, our data seem to confirm previous studies reporting a very high prevalence of antibody to coronavirus OC43 but a less detectable seropositivity m coronavirus 229E.\n\nH u m a n coronaviruses OC43 and 229E are well known as etiological agents of respiratory infections generally affecting the upper respiratory tract and responsible for c o m m o n colds during winter-spring seasons Isolation of these viruses is particularly difficult and, consequently, all epidemiological and reliable data about their diffusion are based upon serological studies p e r f o r m e d using reference strains of cell culture adapted coronaviruses. To date, viruses are included in the coronavirus group for some properties (14) :\n\ni) the presence of one molecu!e of infectious ssRNA of MW ranging from 5.5xl06 and 6.1xl06 daltons with polyadenylated 3' terminus;\n\n1 Corresponding author.\n\nii) morphology showing pleomorphic enveloped particles with diameter ranging from 80 to 160 nm and surface projections (spikes) pro.truding 12-24 nm from envelope;\n\niii) c o m m o n physicochemicai properties such as banding at 1.1.6.-1.23 g/cm 3 in sucrose gradients, disruption bv ether, chloroform, and detergents, removal of surface projections by bromelain and trypsin.\n\nConsequently, viruses could be included in the coronavirus group independently of their antigenic cross-reaction but, particu!arly, for their characteristic morphology (spikes), as revealed by electron microscopy.\n\nH u m a n coronavirus OC43 and 229E are the prototypes of all coronaviruses affecting humans. No particular relatedness has been, to date, re- Vol. 2. 1986 Antibody to coronavims 229E OC43 and NCDCV ported between these two viruses; f u r t h e r m o r e , in vitro, 229E shows an easy growth in h u m a n lung fibroblast cell cultures with evident cytopathogenic effect; on the other hand, OC43 can grow in cell cultures (VERO cells or h u m a n fibroblast cell cultures) only after adaptation of virus strains cultured in suckling mouse brain. Despite their morphological and antigenic differences, these viruses are responsible, in humans, for c o m m o n colds not easily distinguishable by s y m p t o m s or seasonality of appearence.\n\nPrevious reports showed a high prevalence of antibody to h u m a n OC43 and 229E coronavirus in sera collected f r o m patients of northern Italy (1, 2). Results were obtained using very complex tests such as Immune-Adherence Hemagglutination (IAHA), in the case of 229E specific antibody detection, or not highly sensitive and reliable tests, as complement-fixation and hemagglutination-inhibition, for OC43 antibody detection (1, 2).\n\nAnother interesting test was utilized for serodiagnosis of OC43 infection, based upon a microneutralization method, but, despite its high degree of specificity and sensitivity, its performance was economically very expensive (3). F u r t h e r m o r e , the presence of a non specific inhibitor for OC43 and N'CDCV coronavirus present in m a m m a l i a n sera and in fetal calf serum ,(FGS) that can be removed by phospholipase C (PLC) treatment, p r o m p t e d us to develop a new sensitive and specific hemagglutination inhibition test and a new plaque reduction assay (4). By the use of these new tests foc OC43 and by an indirect i m m u n o p e r o x i d a s e staining technique ( I I P ) , for 229E, we carried out a seroepiderniologic study in order to verify previously reported data (2, 3) .\n\nIn addition, the strict antigenic relatedness between OC43 and NCDCV (5) suggested the investigation of the prevalence of a h u m a n i m m u n e response against this bovine virus.\n\nCoronavirus 229E was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC -Rockville, Md., USA) and adapted to grow in h u m a n e m b r y o lung fibroblast cells (HELF).\n\nOC43 and NCDCV coronaviruses were cell culture adapted strains originally obtained f r o m suckling mouse brain adapted virus supplied by Dr. H.S. Kaye (C.D.C., Respiratory Virology Unit, Atlanta, Ga., USA) and Dr. C.A. Mebus, (Dept. of Veterinary Science, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Neb., 68503). Adaptation to growth in H E L F has been previously reported (5) .\n\nThree h u n d r e d and twenty nine sera were collected from hospitalized patients and healthy persons having routine laboratory tests in the University Hospital of Pavia, Italy.\n\nSera f r o m six age groups were studied for specific antibody to 229E, OC43 and NCDCV coronaviruses. A n u m b e r of sera were also collected f r o m leukemic infants and children.\n\nH E L F cells were cultured in sterile microplates for tissue culture; when the monolayer was confluent, all cell wells were infected with 0.05 ml of a suspension of 22qE containing 100 infectious virus particles, incubated at 33\u00b0C for 60 rain. To each well was then added 0.l ml of 199 m e d i u m containing 2% fetal calf serum. Infected cultures were incubated at 33~C for 36 hours, washed 3 times with PBS Du!becco B and then fixed with absolute ethanol. Fixed p r e p a r a t i o n s were immediately used for HP or stored at --70\u00b0C until use. I I P for specific h u m a n antibody detection was p e r f o r m e d as previously described for other viruses (5) (6) (7) (8) , except that the 3-amino -9-ethylcarbazole-H202 colour developing system was used.\n\nAntibody titer to OC43 and NCDCV was detected by HI following a reported procedure (10) and a suggested t r e a t m e n t of sera in order to avoid non-specific inhibitors of OC43 and NCDCV hemagglutination (9) , except that the inactivation of phospholipase C (PLC) with heat t r e a t m e n t (56\u00b0C for 60 rain) was used in substitution of phenanthroline treatment.\n\nPRA for OC43 and NCDCV antibody detection was p e r f o r m e d as previously described (4). Briefly, a titered virus suspension, known to contain 40-50 infectious units of virus, was mixed with an equal volume of serial twofold dilution of .PLC -treated sera diluted in serum -free 199 m e d i u m with addition of glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin and gentamycin.\n\nMixtures were incubated at 33\u00b0C for 60 rain and then inoculated in wells of microplate cell culture of HELF (0.05 rot/well). After adsorption at 33\u00b0C for 60 rain, plaquing m e d i u m ( m e d i u m 199 with fetal calf s e r u m at the final concentration of 10% and 5% for OC43 and NCDCV, respectively), was added for 24 h and then cells were fixed with absolute ethanol and stained by the indirect i m m u n o p e r o x i d a s e staining technique described using mouse h y p e r i m m u n e sera. Figure 1 , antibody to 229E coronavirus was present in a high percentage of sera studied; its prevalence and the specific antibody titer increased with increasing age. Antibody titers in leukemic patients seemed to be consistently lower than in other patients (Figure 1). The results obtained were not particularly different from those observed in previous reports (2, 11, 12) , except for the fact that, because of the greater sensitivity of IIP technique used, antibody titers were greater. Furthermore, the IIP test was very easy to read, as shown in Figure  2 , very simple to perform and can avoid some problems (i.e. false results and/or difficulties in interpreting data) frequently occurring using other conventional and tedious methods like complement fixation and immune adherence hemagglutination.\n\nFinally, the IIP technique for 229E antibody detection had other advantages : it allowed prolonged storage of infected and fixed substrates, and was inexpensive.\n\nAntibody to coronavirus OC43 was very frequent in the studied population. Absence of specific i m m u n e response was an exceptional finding in the course of our survey.\n\nDetection of specific antibody by using hemaglutination inhibition test ( H I ) gave results not particularly different from those previously rep o r t e d for sera collected f r o m patients of the same geographical area (1) thus confirming a very high prevalence of antibody response to this coronavirus.\n\nIn parallel to OC43 antibody detection, we investigated the i m m u n e response to NCDCV, a bovine coronavirus antigenically strictly related to OC43. Antibody titer to OC43 was generally two-fourfold dilutions higher than the titer to NCDCV. We never observed sera positive for OC43 and negative for NCDCV and viceversa.\n\nThe PRA test showed a greater sensitivity than H I (titer obtained were generally fourfourfold dilutions higher) but the i m m u n e response to homologous (OC43) and heterologous (NCDCV) virus were always in the same proportions as observed by using the H ! test (Figures  3 and 4) .\n\nEven in the case of OC43 and NCDCV coronaviruses, sera f r o m leukemic patients showed specific antibody titers lower than titers observed in non leukemic patients in the same group of age.\n\nAs in the case of l i P for 229E, results obtained by PRA for OC43 and NCDCV were easily readable and interpretable as shown by Figure 5 .\n\nCoronaviruses are m e m b e r s of a group of virus characterized by a high incidence in m a n y m a m m a l i a n species, including man.\n\nH u m a n coronaviruses are generally involved in the c o m m o n colds and in u p p e r respiratory tract disease: OC43 and 229E are the m o s t i m p o r t a n t and studied h u m a n coronaviruses.\n\nIn the present w o r k we searched for antibody titer to 229E and OC43 coronavirus using very sensitive tests. Furthermore, we assayed sera in order to detect antibody response to NCDCV, a coronavirus known to cross-react strongly with hum a n OC43, Our data, obtained by m o r e sensitive and reliable methods, a p p e a r to consistently confirm previous reports showing a high prevalence of OC43 and 229E coronavirus in northern Italy and are in agreement with results obtained in other countries (1, 10-12).\n\nAs reported above, we used tests which are sensitive and not particularly tedious and expensive. Hemagglutination inhibition of OC43 and NCDCV p e r f o r m e d after destroying non specific inhibitors is a very simple and reliable test. Sensitivity and specificity of I I P (for 229E) and PRA (for OC43 and NCDCV) were described and are not here discussed.\n\nFinally, the detection of i m m u n e response to NCDCV (the bovine coronavirus antigenically related and cross-reacting with OC43), was due to our interest in confirming these antigenic relationships and excluding that h u m a n sera positive for OC43 were not reacting for NCDCV. These latter data are in agreement with previously reported results (5) and render questionable other reports referring to the presence of specific h u m a n antibody to NCDCV (13) . In fact, the detection of i m m u n e reactivity to h u m a n sera to NCDCV (which however m u s t always be p e r f o r m e d after destroying specific serum inhibitors), is definitely confirmed to be dependant on the strict antigenic relatedness between OC43 and NCDCV and not consequent to h u m a n immunization by NCDCV."}
