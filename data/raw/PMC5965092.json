{"title": "Multihospital Outbreak of a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Deletion Variant, Jordan: A Molecular, Serologic, and Epidemiologic Investigation", "body": "MERS-CoV rRT-PCR-positive nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage samples from 15 of the 16 confirmed cases collected during August\u2013September 2015 were stored at \u221280\u00b0C and shipped to the CDC for molecular analysis. Sample aliquots (200 \u00b5L) were extracted on a NucliSens EasyMAG (BioMerieux), and 100 \u00b5L of total nucleic acid was recovered. The specimen extracts were retested by MERS-CoV N2 and/or N3 rRT-PCR assays [10], and genome sequencing was performed on confirmed positive samples with sufficient viral load using previously described primer sets and protocol [7].\n\nNucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal X, ver. 1.83, implemented in BioEdit, ver. 7.2.5. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using MrBayes, ver. 3.2.6 [12], under a GTR model of nucleotide substitution with 4 categories of \u03b3-distributed rate heterogeneity and a proportion of invariant sites (GTR + 4 + I).\n\nSerum samples collected during March\u2013April 2016 were shipped to the CDC for MERS-CoV-specific serum antibody testing using MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) and spike (S) indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and microneutralization (MNT) assays [4, 13, 14]. Sera were considered potentially positive when the optical density (OD) values were at or above the screening 0.15 cutoff value for N-ELISA or 0.1 for S-ELISA. Any serum potentially positive by N- or S-ELISA at a screening dilution of 1:400 was subsequently titered with serial 4-fold dilutions (1:100\u20131:6400) with OD cutoffs of 0.3 for the N and 0.2 for the S-ELISAs to determine end point titer and tested by MNT for confirmation. Neutralizing antibodies to MERS-CoV were detected by MNT assay performed in Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) containment, as previously described [4]. The neutralization titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that completely inhibited the live MERS-CoV-mediated cytopathic effect in Vero cells in at least 1 of the 3 triplicate wells.\n\nN- and S-ELISAs were considered positive with reciprocal end point titers of 400 or greater. MNT were considered positive with reciprocal titers of 20 or greater. MERS-CoV seropositivity was defined as having 2 of 3 positive assays, including N-ELISA, S-ELISA, and MNT, or positive by MNT alone [14]. Sera indeterminate seropositivity was defined as S-ELISA positive, but N-ELISA and MNT negative.\n\nThis investigation was classified by the CDC as a public health response to an emerging disease outbreak, and Jordanian Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. Verbal consent was obtained in Arabic.\n\nRespiratory specimens from 15 (94%) of the MERS-CoV-positive patients were received by the CDC and confirmed positive by rRT-PCR; 13 specimens representing 11 symptomatic and 2 asymptomatic cases had sufficient viral RNA for genome sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of the 13 nearly complete genomes (GenBank accession No. MF741825-MF741837) and 240 previously published MERS-CoV genomes showed well-supported clustering of the Jordan outbreak sequences within a previously identified clade defined by a signature recombination (Figure 1) [7, 8]. Jordan outbreak sequences showed the closest similarity with sequences obtained from 4 temporally concurrent but epidemiologically unrelated human MERS cases from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in August 2015 (GenBank accession Nos. KU851860\u2013851862 and KU851864), which did not possess any deletion mutations [15].\n\nWe confirmed the 48-nt (16-aa) in-frame deletion in ORF4a present in all Jordan sequences as well as the tandem 9-nt (3-aa) in-frame deletion in ORF3 in sequences from 5 patients (cases 8, 12, 13, 14, 15) obtained later in the outbreak [6]. Additionally, we identified a third 726-nt out-of-frame deletion in ORF4b and ORF5 (genome position 26339\u201327064 based on accession number JX869059.2) (Supplementary Table 1) from 2 patients (cases 3, 11). In ORF4a, ORF3, and ORF4b, 5 deletions were all identified in 2 or more epidemiologically linked patients, indicating successful virus transmission. We also identified 5 additional unique deletions ranging in size from 978 to 1438 nt variably involving ORF1a, ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, and ORF5 that were only present as mixed variants in individual patients (cases 2, 5, 6, 14) without evidence of transmission (Figure 2).\n\nThe viral transmission patterns deduced independently through the epidemiologic investigation corresponded to the grouping of cases by deletions observed in their viral genomes (Figure 3). Three hospital clusters were identified; the earliest cases occurred at hospital A, and index cases for the hospital B and C clusters both had epidemiologic links to hospital A. The 2 cases with the earliest dates of illness onset (cases 1 and 2) were both present at the same coronary care unit (CCU) in hospital A on a single day (case 1 as a patient and case 2 as a visitor); however, no direct contact was documented between them. Before the 2015 outbreak involving the MERS-CoV deletion variants, the last identified MERS case in Jordan had been 8 months earlier, in December 2014. In the 2015 outbreak, cases 1 and 2 had both recently traveled to Jordan from locations on the Arabian Peninsula (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait City, Kuwait, respectively). Interestingly, viruses genetically similar to the viruses detected in cases 1 and 2 in Jordan, but without deletions, were concurrently circulating in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during the period corresponding to the earliest cases in Jordan (August 2015) [15]. Neither case 1 nor case 2 reported contact with a known MERS-CoV patient, camels, or a health care setting outside of Jordan during their exposure period. A review of previous CCU admissions did not reveal other likely index case candidates. Genome sequence analysis could not definitively identify the antecedent virus. Despite an extensive investigation, epidemiologic evidence did not definitively determine which of these 2 cases may have been the index case. Subsequently, 3 patients (cases 3, 5, and 6) and 1 visitor (case 8) at hospital A were identified as cases. Cases 5 and 6 had been admitted in the CCU at hospital A MERS before symptom onset. No cases were identified among HCP at hospital A, including from the CCU. The wife of case 3 tested positive (case 11) shortly after case 3 died; a 726-nt deletion in the ORF4b and ORF5 genes was shared between this couple.\n\nThe hospital B cluster index case was case 2, who visited a relative at hospital A and subsequently became ill with respiratory symptoms within 2 days of his last exposure to hospital A. Case 2 was admitted to hospital B with severe respiratory illness and tested positive for MERS-CoV. His sister, case 4, was not symptomatic and was tested as a contact. Case 7 was a patient at hospital B during the period that case 2 was admitted. Additionally, 1 patient admitted at hospital B during the outbreak period became symptomatic with acute respiratory symptoms 10 days after discharge and was diagnosed with MERS-CoV after returning home to Saudi Arabia. She was not counted among the 16 Jordanian cases. The patient had returned to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, just before onset of respiratory symptoms and was subsequently hospitalized there, transmitting MERS-CoV to an HCP in Jeddah. This case was detected during an investigation of otherwise unexplained hospital-associated MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia [16] and could represent export of the deletion variant virus from Jordan to Saudi Arabia; however, sequences were not available for confirmation.\n\nThe case introducing the deletion variant to hospital C by evidence of onset time (case 8) had visited his daughter at hospital A during the period when MERS-CoV patients were admitted at hospital A. He became ill approximately 5\u20136 days after visiting hospital A and was admitted at hospital C for care. Subsequently, 1 patient (case 14), 1 visitor (case 13), and 2 health care personnel (cases 12 and 15) at hospital C were identified with MERS-CoV infection. The 9-nt deletion in the ORF3 gene was detected among all identified cases linked to the hospital C cluster. The visit of case 8 to hospital A corresponded temporally with the hospitalization of case 5 at hospital A, whose specimen contained 2 genome sequence variants, 1 with the ORF4a deletion only and a second with the 9-nt ORF3 deletion noted above and a downstream 1042-nt out-of-frame deletion involving ORF3, 4a, and 4b.\n\nInterviews and sera were obtained from 301 contacts of the 16 confirmed MERS-CoV cases, including 278 health care and 23 household contacts, as well as 2 surviving confirmed cases (Supplementary Table 2). Of the 278 health care contacts, 3 (1%) were seropositive and 4 (1%) were serologically indeterminate. Seropositive HCP included a nurse, a respiratory therapist, and a radiology clerk. Serologically indeterminate HCP included 2 respiratory therapists, a nurse, and a housekeeper (Table 2). The seropositive respiratory therapist reported fever and cough within 14 days of exposure to a MERS-CoV patient; all others did not report symptoms. The seropositive radiology clerk and symptomatic respiratory therapist tested negative for MERS-CoV by rRT-PCR during the initial outbreak investigation.\n\nSeropositive and serologically indeterminate HCP were detected from 3 hospitals: B, C, and D (Table 2). Of the 58 hospital A HCP tested, none were seropositive or serologically indeterminate. At hospitals B and C, health care\u2013associated transmission was identified at the time of the outbreak; at hospital D, where 2 serologically indeterminate HCP were detected, health care\u2013associated transmission had not been documented. At hospital C, the investigation revealed a seropositive respiratory therapist who cared for both case 8 hospital C (index case) and case 14, who later developed symptoms after hospital discharge. The 2 cases briefly overlapped on the same floor, and case 8 immediately preceded case 14 in a particular radiology suite; however, no direct contact between the patients was reported. Case 15, a nurse at hospital C, also cared for both case 8 and case 14, but her suspected onset followed the exposure periods of these cases.\n\nOf the 23 household contacts, 2 (9%) were seropositive and an additional 2 (9%) were serologically indeterminate. Reported household contact included living in the same household as a confirmed MERS-CoV case, caring for the case at home, and visiting the case in the hospital (Table 2). One seropositive household contact had fever and respiratory symptoms within 14 days of contact with a confirmed case. All household contacts tested negative for MERS-CoV by rRT-PCR during the initial investigation.\n\nOf the 2 surviving confirmed MERS-CoV patients tested, 1 (50%) was seropositive by MNT (case 12) and 1 was seronegative (case 15). Case 12 was a nurse with no comorbidities who had severe illness requiring hospitalization. Case 15 was a nurse with no comorbidities who was documented as asymptomatic.\n\nSupplementary materials are available at Open Forum Infectious Diseases online.
