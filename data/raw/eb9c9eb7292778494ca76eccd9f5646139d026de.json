{"title": "", "body": "Cancer is the world's main public health problem. It is also a main cause of death in the whole world. On the basis of GLOBOCAN, about 17.5 million cancer cases were detected and 8.7 million deaths occurred in 2015 worldwide. 1 In the USA, 1,688,780 new cancer cases and 600,920 cancer deaths were projected to occur in 2017. 2 Although these disturbing numbers indicate that we have not won the \"war on cancer\", recently developed anticancer drugs with higher inhibitory activity and strong selectivity by structural modifications of natural products (such as etoposide, teniposide, vindesine and vinorelbine, which were derived from vinca alkaloids and epipodophyllotoxin) have raised hopes for cancer patients to survive. 3 Today, we use a lot of drugs indirectly or directly derived from natural products, and structural modification of natural products with pharmacological activity to obtain anticancer drugs with high inhibitory activities and selectivity has become a popular research direction. [3] [4] [5] Fructus Ligustri Lucidi, a natural product, is the fruit of Ligustrum lucidum Ait. As a traditional Chinese medicine, Fructus Ligustri Lucidi was discovered and used for the very early treatment of various diseases. 6 Oleanolic acid (OA), a pentacyclic triterpenoid compound, has been isolated from Fructus Ligustri Lucidi. 7 Researchers showed a strong interest in the investigation of OA because of its extensive biological activities, such as antivirus, 8 antitumor, 9, 10 anti-inflammatory 11 and other pharmacological activities. Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) is a natural product extracted from Glycyrrhiza uralensis. 12 GA and OA are similar in structure, and both are pentacyclic triterpenoid compounds (Figure 1 ). GA also has antitumor, 13, 14 anti-inflammatory, 15, 16 antiviral, 17, 18 antiallergic 19 and antiulcer activities. 20 Some studies have found that OA and GA have a broad inhibitory effect on the growth of many tumor cell lines in vitro by inducing tumor cell autophagy and apoptosis, blocking the cell cycle and inhibiting multidrug resistance of tumors. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] To further explore the physiological activities of OA and GA, researchers performed a large number of structural modifications and studies of biological activities on these two natural products. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] Through previous reports, we think that through structural modification to improve the anticancer activity of OA and GA is appropriate. Chu et al reported the first preparation of ligustrazine-oleanolic acid and then the introduction of amino acid fragments to obtain new compounds with high inhibitory activities. 31 Li et al reported that first the preparation of GA esters and then the introduction of 3-(1H-benzo [d] imidazol-2-yl)propanoic acid fragments can greatly improve the anticancer activity, as compared with GA itself. 32 In this research, we use the method of combination to prepare OA and GA esters to increase their lipophilicity and introduce organic acid groups to increase their polarity. We selected 10 kinds of organic acids (nicotinic acid, 33 indole-3-acetic acid, 3-indolebutyric acid, cinnamic acid, 34 isonicotinic acid, salicylic acid, 35 acetyl 4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 36 acetylsalicylic acid, acetyl 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and acetyl 4-hydroxybenzoic acid) with certain biological activity into the 3-OH position of the OA ester and GA ester, and finally synthesized 20 new OA and GA derivatives, of which 18 new compounds were the target products. We used five cancer cell lines (SGC-7901, MCF-7, Eca-109, HeLa and Hep-G2) to determine the antitumor activity and human skin fibroblasts (HSF) as a control.\n\nMost of the solvents and reagents used in the experiment were bought from Xinyue Chemical and Glass Co. (Weihai, China) without further purification. The OA and GA were bought from Tianjin Heowns Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd (Tianjin, China) without further purification. All the cell lines were bought from Shanghai Institute of Cellular Biology of Chinese Academy of Sciences. 13 C-and 1 H-NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker-400 instrument (400 MHz) by using CDCl 3 as the solvent. High-resolution-electrospray ionization-mass spectra (HR-ESI-MS) were recorded with LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer. SGW X-4 micro-melting point apparatus was used to measure melting points (mp). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and column chromatography were performed on silica gel plates and silica gel. synthesis of compounds general experimental method for the synthesis of 2a,b 1a or 1b (1 mmol) and anhydrous potassium carbonate (500 mg, 3.62 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; 10 mL) were stirred at 25\u00b0C for 30 min. Then, 0.18 mL of benzyl bromide (1.5 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at 25\u00b0C for 8 h. When the reaction was over, first, saturated sodium chloride (10 mL) was added. Then, extraction was carried out with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, followed by suction filtration and concentration to obtain the target compound 2a or 2b. general experimental method for the synthesis of 3a-e, 3h-l, 5a,b, 6a,b and 7a,b\n\nOne millimole of R 1 OH (or R 2 OH) and 1-ethyl- ( 154.1, 143.7, 136.5, 131.1, 131.1, 128.6, 128.4, 128.4, 128.3 general experimental way for the synthesis of 3f,g and 3m,n DMF (50 \u03bcL) was added to a solution of nicotinic acid or isonicotinic acid (1.5 mol) in SOCl 2 (10 mL) at 0\u00b0C for 10 min. The mixture was slowly heated to 78\u00b0C, stirred and refluxed for 3 h, and the excess SOCl 2 was distilled off under reduced pressure to obtain a white acid chloride product.

The mixture was stirred at room temperature, and TLC was used to monitor the reaction progress. After the reaction was over, the mixture was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and saturated sodium chloride solution. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 and filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to get a yellow solid. The target product was purified by column chromatography (ethyl acetate/petroleum=1/4) to obtain 3f,g and 3m,n as white solids. another experimental way for the synthesis of 5a,b\n\nCompound 2a or 2b (1 mmol) was dissolved in pyridine (5 mL); then, anhydrous acetic anhydride (10 mL) was added, which was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. 37, 38 After the reaction was completed, the mixture was poured into ice-cold dilute hydrochloric acid and kept overnight. Afterward, the mixture was filtered and washed with 2 mol/L hydrochloric acid to remove the pyridine; this was washed with water to neutralize and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The organic layer was filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated to get a yellow solid. The latter was purified by column chromatography (ethyl acetate/petroleum=1/4) to give a white solid. The spectroscopic results are consistent with those of 5a,b.\n\nThe tested compounds were dissolved in a suitable amount of dimethyl sulfoxide prior to the experiment to obtain a known concentration of the solution, and then these solutions were diluted to various concentrations with the culture medium. To evaluate the cytotoxic activity, the SGC-7901 (gastric cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer), Eca-109 (esophageal cancer), HeLa (cervical cancer) and Hep-G2 (hepatoma cancer) cell lines (2\u00d710 4 cells/mL) and HSF (normal HSF; 1\u00d710 4 cells/mL) were placed in 96-well plates and cultured for 24 h at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO 2 atmosphere. After 24 h of incubation, the culture medium was discarded, the cells were treated with the test compound of various concentrations for 48 h and the control groups were treated with the medium alone. Then, 20 \u03bcL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) was added to each well. After incubation for another 4 h, the medium was aspirated, and the formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 \u03bcL dimethyl sulfoxide for each well. The absorbance was measured at a test wave length of 490 nm using a Bio-Rad iMark\u2122 microplate reader. The IC 50 values were obtained by linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism (version 5.01).\n\nHep-G2 cells were seeded into six-well plates, cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 for 24 h. After that, the medium was replaced with a medium containing different concentrations of compound 5b (0, 4 and 8 \u03bcM) for 24 or 48 h. Cell apoptosis was assayed by using a PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were digested by 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution, washed twice with cold PBS and stained with Annexin V-PE (5 \u03bcL) and 7-AAD (5 \u03bcL) in binding buffer. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, cell apoptosis was analyzed by BD FACS Aria III flow cytometer.\n\nHep-G2 cells were seeded into six-well plates, cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 for 24 h. The medium was replaced with a medium containing different concentrations of compound 5b (0, 4 and 8 \u03bcM) for 48 h. The medium was removed, washed with cold PBS and fixed with formalin (4%, w/v). Cell nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 at a concentration of 10 \u03bcg/mL in PBS for 10 min in the dark. Finally, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS and examined under a fluorescence microscope.\n\nHep-G2 cells were seeded into six-well plates, cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 for 24 h. After that, the medium was replaced with a medium containing different concentrations of compound 5b (0, 4 and 8 \u03bcM) for 24 or 48 h. The medium was removed again, and the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS twice. Then, the cells were stained with monodansylcadaverine (MDC) solution (50 mM) for 15 min and washed twice with PBS. The data were obtained by flow cytometry.\n\nAs shown in Scheme 1, OA derivatives, namely, 3a-g, were synthesized. The esterification of OA at C-28 was performed by treatment with benzyl bromide to produce OA ester 2a.\n\nOrganic acids (R 1 OH) were coupled with the 3-OH position of 2a to obtain esters 3a-e using the DMAP/EDCI system. Nicotinic acid or isonicotinic acid was dissolved in SOCl 2 , and triethylamine and 2a were added to obtain 3f-g. The synthesis of GA derivatives 3h-n is described in Scheme 2. Treatment of GA with benzyl bromide in the presence of K 2 CO 3 gives the GA ester 2b. The 3-OH position of 2b reacts with organic acids (R 2 OH) in the EDCI/DMAP system to form compounds 3h-l. Treatment of nicotinic acid or isonicotinic acid with SOCl 2 was followed by the addition of triethylamine and 2b as the acid-binding agent, using the esterification procedure to obtain the compounds 3m,n . Compounds 5a,b, 6a,b and  7a,b were prepared as shown in Schemes 3 and 4. In some studies, it has been reported that the esters of acetylsalicylic acid easily undergo ester exchange reactions. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] 39 Thus, when acetylsalicylic acid was reacted with 2a,b in the EDCI/ DMAP system, we did not obtain 4a,b, but rather 5a,b, and we have shown the possible reaction mechanism in Figure 2 . The high nucleophilicity of DMAP contributed to its nucleophilic addition to the ester moiety of acetylsalicylic acid to form intermediate I, which was converted to a N-acylpyridinium intermediate by elimination of a phenoxide anion. Afterward, the N-acylpyridinium salt was nucleophilically attacked by the hydroxyl moiety of 2a,b to produce intermediate II, which was neutralized by the in situ formed phenoxide anion, followed by removal of DMAP and transformation into the desired ester 5a or 5b. We have attempted to obtain 6a,b and 7a,b by treating 2a,b with acetyl 3-hydroxybenzoic acid and acetyl 4-hydroxybenzoic acid in the EDCI/DMAP system. While the treatment of 2a,b with acetyl 3-hydroxybenzoic acid indeed allows preparing 6a,b, we almost did not get other by-products. Interestingly, the main product obtained as a result of the interaction of acetylated 4- hydroxybenzoic  acid with 2a,b is 5a,b instead of 7a,b. in vitro cytotoxic activity The compounds 1a,b, 2a,b, 3a-n, 5a,b, 6a,b and 7a,b were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxicity against SGC-7901, MCF-7, Eca-109, HeLa, Hep-G2 and HSF cells by 40 Considering that the literatures related to this study used both micromolar studies of the cytotoxicity of OA and GA derivatives, 31, 32, 41, 42 so this research used micromolar to study the cytotoxicity of the compounds 1a,b,  2a,b, 3a-n, 5a,b, 6a,b and 7a,b. The antitumor activities were expressed in terms of IC 50 (\u03bcM) and are summarized in Table 1 . On the whole, GA and its derivatives had better cytotoxicity than OA and its derivatives. The parent compounds OA and GA both showed low inhibitory activities against MCF-7 cells, Hep-G2 cells and HSF cells. GA had better cytotoxicity values than gefitinib for SGC-7901 cells, Eca-109 cells and HeLa cells, especially for SGC-7901 cells with an IC 50 value of 10.20\u00b11.23 \u03bcM, but OA showed a poor inhibitory effect on these three cell lines. In contrast to OA and GA, esterified compounds 2a and 2b with benzyl group exhibited relatively high inhibitory activities against MCF-7 cells, Eca-109 cells and Hep-G2 cells. This indicated that the benzyl group introduced in C-28 position of OA or C-30 position of GA was beneficial to improve the inhibitory activity against these cancer cells. The selective inhibitory activity of the compounds was significantly enhanced when OA was further modified. Compounds 3a-g showed strong inhibitory activities against Hep-G2 cells, but a poor inhibitory effect on HSF cells. This result is consistent with the test results of novel ligustrazine-oleanolic acidamino acid derivatives synthesized by Chu et al. 31 The R 1 group was 4-(1H-indol-3-yl)butyroxy long-chain-substituted compound (3b, IC 50 8.97\u00b10.13 \u03bcM), which had a significantly stronger inhibitory activity against Hep-G2 cells than 2-(1H-indol-3-yl)acetoxy short-chain-substituted compound (3a, IC 50 24.47\u00b11.18 \u03bcM). Introducing salicyloyloxy (3d) to C-3 position of 2a led to a significant increase of the selective inhibitory activity with a low IC 50 value of 4.06\u00b10.24 \u03bcM on Hep-G2 cells, but for HSF cells, it exhibited a poor inhibitory effect with a high IC 50 value of 79.94\u00b14.42 \u03bcM. In addition, 3f and 3g with heteroaroyl group at C-3 position of 2a also presented the superior activity against Hep-G2 cells. Surprisingly, compounds 6a and 7a, bearing the same AcO group in different locations, presented a strong inhibitory activity against HeLa cells, and the compound with o-AcO substitutions (6a, IC 50 11.98\u00b10.51 \u03bcM) at an aromatic ring was more active than the compound with p-AcO substitutions (7a, IC 50 15.51\u00b10.73 \u03bcM). As a result of further modification of GA, the compounds exhibited different anticancer activities. Compounds 3h, 3i and 3k displayed a poor inhibitory effect on the five kinds of cancer cells, indicating that these organic acid moieties introduced in C-3 position of 2b were not beneficial to enhance their inhibitory activity. Compounds 3j and 3l exhibited a strongly selective inhibitory activity, and in particular, compound 3l showed the strongest inhibitory activity against HeLa cells with an IC 50 value of 4.32\u00b10.89 \u03bcM, suggesting that an AcO substituent might enhance 3j toward tumor cell lines. Compounds 3m and 3n presented more potential anticancer activity in comparison with gefitinib, with compound 3m being the most active one, indicating that the heteroaroyl introduced in C-3 position of 2b was beneficial to enhance its inhibitory activity. The cytotoxicity of the derivatives obtained by the Schwarz and Csuk introduction of amino acids at the C-3 position of the GA benzyl ester is consistent with the present results. 42 Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of compound 3m on HSF cells was lower than that of gefitinib (IC 50 , 20.54\u00b10.52 \u03bcM). In addition, 5b with AcO group at C-3 position of 2b showed the superior inhibitory activity against tumor cell lines, especially for Hep-G2 cells with an IC 50 value of 3.74\u00b10.18 \u03bcM. Yadav et al 43 used the quantitative structureactivity relationship (QSAR) model to predict that compound 5b has a significant inhibitory effect on MCF-7 cells. Our experimental results are consistent with the predictions. Like compounds 6a and 7a, compounds 6b and 7b also presented strong targeting inhibition of HeLa cells with IC 50 values of 7.82\u00b10.02 and 10.51\u00b10.62 \u03bcM, respectively. In summary, although the structures of OA and GA were similar, they and their derivatives exhibited different anticancer activities. Their anticancer activity was different even if the same group was introduced. Another important finding was that the introduction of a pyridine ring with a lower electron density to the 3-OH position of GA benzyl ester (compounds 3m and 3n) could greatly increase its anticancer activity.\n\nFurthermore, the incorporation of a carbonyl group with an electron-withdrawing property into the 3-OH position of GA benzyl ester (compound 5b) also could greatly improve its anticancer activity. Therefore, we tried to sum up a conclusion as follows: GA was first converted into its benzyl ester of GA, and then an electron-withdrawing group was introduced to the 3-OH position of the benzyl ester of GA, which could greatly improve the anticancer activity of GA. This conclusion also applied to OA because the introduction of electron-withdrawing groups to the 3-OH position of the benzyl ester of OA (compounds 3f, 3g and 5a) could also significantly improve the anticancer activity of OA.\n\nGiven that 5b showed high antiproliferative activity on Hep-G2 cells, we used Hep-G2 cells to further study the mechanism of action of 5b. As shown in Figure 3 , 5b presented a significant effect on inhibiting Hep-G2 cells' growth, and it inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration-and time-dependent manner. Figure 3 also shows that ~50% of Hep-G2 cells died during treatment with 5 \u03bcM 5b for 48 h.\n\nApoptosis and necrosis, especially the former, are common cellular responses to anticancer drugs. To further evaluate whether the cytotoxic effect of 5b is related to apoptosis, we detected cell apoptosis by Hoechst 33342 apoptotic staining kit and detected apoptosis rate by Annexin V/7-AAD double staining method (Figures 4 and 5) . After treatment with different concentrations (0 \u03bcM for control, 4 and 8 \u03bcM) of compound 5b for 48 h, the nuclei of Hep-G2 cells were stained by Hoechst 33342 to detect the apoptotic cells. As shown in Figure 4 , compared with the control group, a large number of cells with blue light spots were observed in the test group in a dose-dependent manner. The result indicated the existence of induced apoptosis caused by the treatment of compound 5b. Then, we used Annexin V-PE/7-AAD dual staining to detect the early and late apoptosis of Hep-G2 cells treated with different concentrations of compound 5b for 24 and 48 h. As shown in Figure 5 , the population of apoptotic cells treated with compound 5b had increased remarkably with a dose-and time-dependent relation (the percentages of Annexin V-positive cells were 5.2% for the control group, 11.7% for 4 \u03bcM and 21.5% for 8 \u03bcM after 24 h treatment and 7.2% for the control group, 15.7% for 4 \u03bcM and 45.8% for 8 \u03bcM after 48 h treatment).\n\nAutophagy, as a lysosomal degradation pathway which is considered to be the third mode of cell death besides \n\ncytotoxic properties of Oa and ga derivatives apoptosis and necrosis, is essential for homeostasis under normal conditions. To determine whether autophagy is truly triggered by these derivatives, Hep-G2 cells were treated with 0, 4 and 8 \u03bcM of compound 5b for 24 and 48 h. Then, the cells were stained with MDC as the fluorescent probe to detect the autophagic activity. As shown in Figure 6 , \n\nIn this study, based on the principle of combination and through a simple two-step synthetic method, we designed and synthesized a series of OAs and GAs and tested their cytotoxicity by MTT assay with SGC-7901, MCF-7, Eca-109, HeLa, Hep-G2 and HSF cells. Among all the OA and GA derivatives, compound 3m was the most active anticancer agent against SGC-7901, MCF-7 and Eca-109 cells (IC 50 , 7.57\u00b10.64, 5.51\u00b10.41 and 5.03\u00b10.56 \u03bcM, respectively), while it showed lower inhibitory activity against normal HSF than gefitinib. For Hep-G2 cells, compound 5b showed the best cytotoxic effect (IC 50 , 3.74\u00b10.18 \u03bcM), and our pharmacological evaluation showed that compound 5b could induce autophagy and apoptosis in Hep-G2 cells. In addition, compound 3l exhibited the strongest inhibitory activity against HeLa cells (IC 50 , 4.32\u00b10.89 \u03bcM) in comparison with four other cancer cell lines and presented low cytotoxicity toward HSF cells (IC 50 , 57.48\u00b10.57 \u03bcM). Because of its strong selective inhibition, 3l may be a potential new anti-Hela candidate drug, which has a unique mechanism of action and deserves further study. Like compound 3l, compound 3d presented the superior selective inhibitory activity against Hep-G2 cells (IC 50 , 4.06\u00b10.24 \u03bcM) in comparison with the other four cancer cell lines and also presented low cytotoxicity toward HSF cells (IC 50 , 79.94\u00b14.42 \u03bcM). It may be a potential new anti-Hep-G2 candidate drug, which has a unique mechanism of action and also deserves further study.\n\nSubmit your manuscript here: http://www.dovepress.com/drug-design-development-and-therapy-journal Drug Design, Development and Therapy is an international, peerreviewed open-access journal that spans the spectrum of drug design and development through to clinical applications.
