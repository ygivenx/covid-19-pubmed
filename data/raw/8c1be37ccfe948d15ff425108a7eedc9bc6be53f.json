In brief,\n\nIn performing these experiments comparing the efficiency of Bgp1 a and Bgp1 b NTD receptors, we readily identified a correlation between virus binding capacity and syncytium formation. Upon infection by MHV-A59, stable HeLa-Bgp1 a transfectants fused rapidly into polykaryons, while the corresponding HeLa-Bgp1 b NTD cells were much less susceptible. This was readily evident by simple microscopic examination of infected cell monolayers anywhere from 10 to 30 hr postinfection. However, previously published information suggested that measurements of additional receptor mutants for virus binding and fusion promotion capacities might not reveal a direct relationship between these two properties. First, evidence for the uncoupling of virus binding and fusion activation functions has been demonstrated in studies of mutant retrovirus receptors (James et al., 1996; Lifson et al., 1988; Truneh et al., 1991) . Second, two reports focusing on the \n\nThe results obtained from a subset of these tests is shown in Fig. 9 .

These differences between the two receptors in virus binding Bgp1 a and 1 b do indeed differ in virion adsorptive capacity (Boyle et al., 1987; Dveksler et al., 1993a) , thereby capacity impact the outcome of MHV infection. We found that transfection of either Bgp1 a or Bgp1 b NTD genes into providing the opportunity for determining which nonhomologous region(s) control the differences. Our initial HeLa cells conferred sensitivity to MHV A59 infection, but Bgp1 b NTD was inefficiently utilized as revealed by goal was to establish assays in which we could accurately measure the relative virus binding capacities of quantitation of infectious centers (Fig. 4) . This latter finding was generally consistent with a variety of previous these two receptors. We anticipated that the success of these assays might require abundant receptor levels observations. Chen and Baric (1996) reported that challenge of stable BHK-Bgp1 a transfectants with MHV A59 because previous attempts to measure virion binding to murine cells endogenously expressing Bgps were not led to titers of 10 8 PFU/ml after 1 day, while parallel challenge of BHK-mmCGM2 (Bgp1 b ) transfectants sensitive enough to reveal any specific adsorption (Yokomori et al., 1993; Wilson and Dales, 1988) . Our binding yielded only 10 4 PFU/ml. In similar tests, Compton (1994) found analagous (but less dramatic) differences between assays therefore involved interaction of radiolabeled virions to native receptors that were overexpressed on the the two stably transfected BHK cell lines in their support of MHV A59 infection. Finally, Yokomori and Lai (1992b) surface of HeLa cells from vaccinia vectors. By this method, specific binding measurements were obtained, found that Cos7 cells transiently transfected with Bgp1 a or 1 b supported very low levels of MHV A59; the 1 a even though the proportions of cell-associated [ 35 S] virions were relatively low (Fig. 6) .

At present we have no evidence of sepa-stretch in binding, perhaps because some patterns will impact overall receptor conformation. rate domains on the Bgp molecule that are individually responsible for binding and induction of membrane fu-Exchange of Bgp1 a residues 38-43 with those from 1 b also eliminates a potential N-linked glycan addition site sion. However, such separate domains may eventually be identified, as studies of both the HIV and poliovirus at residue 37. However it has been established from thorough mutagenesis studies in the Holmes laboratory receptors have revealed specific regions that induce changes in virion conformation required for membrane that a carbohydrate at this position does not contribute to virus binding (Dveksler et al., 1995) . Identification of penetration (James et al., 1996; Morrison et al., 1994) . Finally, the results from these quantitative binding these critical amino acid residues led us to attempt blockade of binding with synthetic peptides. To date we assays may shed light on the determinants of murine coronavirus tropism in vivo. JHMX can infect murine brain have been unable to interfere with the virus:receptor interaction using synthetic Bgp1 a peptide 33-45, implying tissue more readily than A59 (Lavi et al., 1986; Robb and Bond, 1979) , and the overall abundance of Bgp1 a and 1 b a requirement for the immunoglobulin-like framework region in presenting a defined conformation of the resi-in brain is very low Lai, 1992a, 1992b) . Given that JHMX is actually less avid than A59 in the dues.\n\nAccording to a predicted three-dimensional model for Bgp binding properties, it appears likely that the different in vivo tropisms of these strains are not dictated simply the corresponding human CEA NTD (Bates et al., 1992) , residues 38 to 43 would represent a ''loop'' that is held by their capacity to bind these Bgps but rather by utilization of alternative receptors or by additional events oc-in place by two of the beta strands (strands C and C) that comprise a portion of the framework region (Fig. 8) .\n\ncurring subsequent to binding.
