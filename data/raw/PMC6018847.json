{"title": "Assessment of transport stress on cattle travelling a long distance (\u2248648 km), from Jessore (Indian border) to Chittagong, Bangladesh", "body": "In today\u2019s modern society, transport of livestock is an integral part of farming. Live animals may be moved due to a change of ownership from one farm to another, a change in the rearing areas, and for marketing from short-distance or long-distance sale yard, live cattle market, abattoir, feedlot or pre-export assembly depot.1\n\n\nTransport stress is a complex issue. Many things factor into transportation stress to include transport management, climatic factors (temperature, humidity, gases and so on), handling methods and facilities, feed and water deprivation, and so on.1 An animal\u2019s response to the effects of transportation stress creates a complex interaction between neurons and hormones. The results of such interactions are manifested clinically (Minka and Ayo)2 by changes in physical (external changes), haematological, biochemical and hormonal parameters (internal changes) of the body.3 In general, the biochemical changes due to transportation stress include a decrease in glucose concentrations, and an increase in non-esterified free fatty acid, muscle enzymes (such as creatine kinase),4 5 packed cell volume (PCV)6 and serum protein.3 4 Due to activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA),1 researchers have also reported marked changes in cortisol and catecholamine in different stages of transportation.6 7\n\n\nConsidering the immune response, transport stress results in increases in the number of total white blood cells, neutrophils, eosinophils and mononuclear cells in particular. However, transport stress results in decreased lymphocyte counts.8 9 These changes in blood parameters may be useful biomarkers in estimating the degree of transport stress.10 Transport stress has a negative effect on production and reproductive performance11; for example, it causes liveweight loss that varies from 3 to 12 per cent depending on the duration and conditions of a journey.12\n\n\nThe transportation of livestock in Bangladesh is mainly performed by road vehicles. Bangladesh is a tropical country where temperature (average 30\u00b0C\u201340\u00b0C) and humidity (average 60\u201385 per cent) become higher during the summer season. Most days are very hot and the UV exposure is high. Animal transporters attempt to move animals under adverse weather conditions and this can be detrimental to the animals. Various cruel practices such as rough handling, high stocking density, transport in high temperature, humidity and so on are different forms of welfare violations that have been observed, and these practices increase the risk of muscle injury and fatigue.13 In a nutshell, transportation stress results in multidirectional effects that include body injuries, bodyweight shrinkage and degradation of meat quality.14 Transportation can also decrease immunity, increase infectious diseases susceptibility and eventually result in the death of an animal. Therefore, the current study investigated the health conditions, and the extent and pattern of cattle injuries, along with haemato-biochemical and hormonal changes, before and after long-distance transportation (\u2248648 km) from the market of origin to the market of destination.\n\nTwo LCMs in Bangladesh were purposively selected for the study: (1) Benapole LCM (market of origin; the market from where the transport of cattle was started), which is situated in Jessore District (23\u00b011\u203239.8\u2032 N and 89\u00b004\u203202.5\u2032 E), about 648 km from Chittagong; and (2) Sagorika LCM (destination market; the market where the travel was ended and cattle were unloaded), which is located within the Chittagong metropolitan city (22\u00b021\u203231.4\u2032N and 91\u00b046\u203243.1\u2032 E) (Fig 1). The Benapole LCM was chosen because of its proximity to the Indian border with southern Bangladesh and the potential for trade of different exotic (imported from India) cattle breeds (Bos indicus) like Hariana, Hallikar, Gir, Ongole and Tharparkar. During the peak season (August to September), just before Eid-Ul-Adha, a big festival for the Muslim community in Bangladesh when people sacrifice animals to satisfy God, between 20,000 and 25,000 cattle are legally or illegally imported each day from India to Bangladesh.15 Haat days, or trading days, at Benapole LCM run on Saturday and Tuesday of each week. This market is the largest of its kind in the south-western region of Bangladesh. On any given haat day, around 15,000\u201320,000 cattle are kept on the market, while on average nearly 10,000 cattle are sold.16\n\n\nSagorika LCM trades local cattle as well as Indian cattle, which are transported from the LCM of Benapole in Jessore. The usual size for trading in this market during the peak season (August to September, just before Eid-Ul-Adha) has been estimated to be 15,000\u201320,000 per day.17\n\n\nAlthough the distance between the markets is quite long for transporting cattle, this long-standing traditional practice of cattle trading exists because of better market price achieved through sales in the Chittagong region. The animals were not immediately sold out but usually stocked at the destination market for two to three days before the sale. The present study was conducted between July and December 2015, where the fieldwork was performed between August and September 2015, which corresponded to the peak season of cattle trade in Bangladesh. Four different single-decker trucks of the same size (body size: length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height: 25 feet \u00d7 9 feet \u00d7 3.5 feet) and from the same vehicle manufacturer (Nitol Tata Company) were used for transporting the animals during the study period. Each trip using one single truck was made at 15-day intervals. The first author of this manuscript was accompanied by the coauthor (TMR), and they travelled by public transport each time in parallel with the selected cattle vehicle from the market of origin to the market of destination.\n\nDuring transportation, the average environmental temperature and humidity were 31\u00b0C\u201333\u00b0C and 84\u201389 per cent during the day, and 26\u00b0C\u201329\u00b0C and 78\u201384 per cent during the night, respectively (Bangladesh Meteorological Department; http://www.bmd.gov.bd). The space allocation for each animal in the vehicle was 8\u201310 square feet on average per animal. Therefore, the space allocation in the vehicle restricted the animals from lying down, so they remained standing the entire transportation period. The floor of the truck was wooden and the cattle were transported without any bedding materials. The surrounding walls of the vehicles were made of iron. The transportation vehicles did not have ceilings or roof coverings; therefore the cattle were exposed to different weather conditions, such as sunlight or rain. For around half this distance, roads are often damaged with potholes, or are very uneven, which can cause sudden jerks or shaking movements of the truck during transportation. No provision of food and water was made for the animals during transportation. However, the animals were provided with paddy straw (the dried paddy plant after removal of matured seeds) and water before the start (30 minutes or 1 hour) and immediately after the end of transport. Paddy straw and water were also the sole feed for cattle for the next 24 hours when the authors collect blood samples at 24 hours after arrival in the destination market.\n\nAll cattle that were proposed to be transported long distance from the market of origin (Benapole LCM) to the market of destination (Sagorika LCM) were considered to be the reference population. A total of 100 (25 from each trip) adult cattle, age two years or older, irrespective of breed and sex (mostly male), were selected for assessing health conditions (nasal discharge, diarrhoea and dehydration) and physical injuries before and after transportation. Due to limitation of funds, among the previously selected 100 cattle, blood samples were taken from 50 randomly selected cattle (13, 13, 12 and 12 from first, second, third and fourth travels, respectively) for haemato-biochemical evaluation at three time phases, viz just before the start of the trip (at the market of origin), after reaching and unloading at the market of destination, and after 24 hours of reaching the market of destination. Animal transportation usually started at 18:00 from the source market and reached the destination market the following day at about 06:00\u201310:00.\n\nA structured questionnaire was designed in relation to the targeted objectives of the study. The information included in the questionnaire was the site and severity of injuries of animals, different health conditions such as nasal discharge, diarrhoea and dehydration, and environmental temperature and humidity (day and night). Animals were assessed closely by the first author of the manuscript twice (at the initial location and at the destination market). Animals were marked by permanent unique colour to identify the same animals at the destination site. Images of different injuries were taken with a digital camera (model no. DV 100; Samsung).\n\nDiarrhoea was assessed by inspecting the perianal area for adhesion of faeces, observing faeces characteristics around the animal holding area, and history taken from the cattle trader on increased frequency and volume of defecation (if the trader observed and recalled this information).18 Dehydration was evaluated by looking at the condition of the eyes (sunken eye) and by performing skin fold test19 (Table 1).\n\nBlood samples from the selected animals were collected at the market of source (at 0 hour) and at the market of destination (immediately after arrival and then again 24 hours after arrival at the destination market).\n\nBlood samples, 6 ml per animal, were collected from the jugular veins of the animals and placed in two separate vials: one containing EDTA for haematological evaluation and one having no EDTA for biochemical and hormonal evaluation. Each vial contained 3 ml of the blood sample. The blood samples obtained were transferred through insulated ice eskies to the laboratory at Chittagong Veterinary and Animal Sciences University between 2 and 16 hours from the destination and source market, respectively. The blood samples without anticoagulant were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the serum samples. The serum samples were transferred to the Eppendorf tube (2 ml) and then stored in \u221218\u00b0C for further analysis. The blood samples with anticoagulants were stored at 4\u00b0C. All laboratory analyses were performed within 24 hours.\n\nThe blood samples with anticoagulant were analysed for haemoglobin (Hb), PCV, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, total leucocyte count (TLC), total erythrocyte count (TEC) and differential leucocyte count (DLC) as per the protocol described or developed by Weiss and Wardrop.20\n\n\nSerum samples were evaluated for serum glucose, total protein (TP), calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), creatine kinase (CK) and triglyceride (TG) levels using a biochemical analyser (Humalyzer 3000 Chemistry Analyzer, semiautomated benchtop chemistry photometer). The commercial kit supplied by RANDOX with its testing protocol for each selected biochemical parameter was used.\n\nThe cortisol hormone was determined using an ELISA-based technique using the commercial kit of Monobind with its protocol (http://www.monobind.com/site/index.html, accessed on March 12, 2015).\n\nAll collected data and laboratory data were entered into Microsoft Excel 2007 and data integrity was checked. Data were then exported to the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences V.16 (SPSS V.16) software for statistical analysis. Qualitative traits like types, number and location of injuries and physical conditions were compared by McNemar\u2019s chi-square tests for paired samples. Comparisons of the quantitative parameters of serum and blood analysis between before (0 hour) and after transportation (13.8\u00b10.9 hours and 37.8\u00b10.9 hours) were performed using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc tests for assessing pairwise comparison. The paired t test was also applied to assess the mean values of cortisol between before and after transportation. The variations of different parameters were considered significant when the P values were <0.05. The results are expressed as frequency number, percentage, mean and sd. As the floor and wall characteristics, space for animals, provision of feed and water, and other management aspects of transportation were very similar between vehicles, no confounding effect by type of transportation vehicle was therefore expected on the occurrence of outcomes. Therefore, the transport vehicle was not considered as a confounder in the statistical analysis. Transport/vehicle was not considered as a clustered variable because animals within each vehicle were not assumed as homogeneous. Therefore, no random effect of transport was expected in data analysis.\n\nAbout 26 per cent (n=100) of the cattle had injuries on different body parts that were recorded in the market of origin (Benapole LCM). However, the frequency of injuries increased significantly after long-distance transportation to the destination market (47 per cent; n=100) (Sagorika LCM) (P<0.001).\n\nSix different types of injury were recorded in the studied animals. They included abrasion, laceration, swelling, scarification, barbed wire injury and bone fracture. In almost all cases the frequency of injury by type increased after transportation, where the occurrence of abrasion, laceration and barbed wire injury significantly increased after transportation (Table 2). The overall frequency of injuries increased after transportation, but single-type injury significantly increased after transportation (P<0.001) (Table 2).\n\nImages of types of injury in different body parts of the animals are presented in Fig 2.\n\nInjury in different anatomical locations of animals increased after transportation, but the difference was not significant (Table 3).\n\nThere was a significant difference (P=0.03) between the incidence of nasal discharge before and after transportation (15 per cent v 28 per cent). However, the occurrences of diarrhoea remained non-significant (P=0.15) between these two phases of transportation (15 per cent v 23 per cent). Dehydration, by category, also significantly differed before and after transportation (P<0.001) (Table 4).\n\nThe levels of Hb (P=0.01), TEC (P=0.001), TLC (P<0.001), lymphocyte (P=0.005), neutrophil (P=0.01), eosinophil (P=0.01) and the lymphocyte and neutrophil (L:N) ratio (P=0.006) significantly varied before and after transportation (ANOVA). A significant increase in Hb, TEC, neutrophil and L:N ratio was observed right after transport in comparison with the pretransport values, although the values returned to pretransport levels 24 hours after the end of transportation. In the case of TLC, the value increased significantly just after transportation, where after 24 hours of transportation it decreased to significantly lower than the pretransport value. The lymphocyte count decreased significantly just after transportation and also increased substantially at 24 hours after transportation, although the value remained lower than the pretransport one. A persistent increment of eosinophil count was observed along with the changes of phases of transportation (post-hoc test for pairwise comparison, P\u22640.05) (Table 5). Among the three separate sampling times, the PCV, monocyte count and basophil count showed no variations.\n\nThe concentration of serum TP (P=0.006), ALP (P=0.04), CK (P<0.001) and TG (P=0.04) significantly differed between before and after transportation (ANOVA). Serum TP, ALP, CK and TG were significantly higher in animals immediately after reaching the destination market than in animals at the market of origin. However, the values of TP, ALP, CK and TG returned to the original values after 24 hours of arrival at the destination market. A significant increase in serum calcium level (ANOVA P=0.003) compared with the pretransport value was observed right after transport, and the value remained elevated 24 hours after the end of transportation. Non-significant variations in serum phosphorus levels were noticed between before transportation and just after transportation, although the value significantly decreased 24 hours after the end of transportation (ANOVA P<0.001) (post-hoc test for pairwise comparison P<0.05) (Table 6).\n\nThe value of serum cortisol remained unchanged before and after transportation (t test P=0.16) (Table 6).\n\nSelection bias might be introduced as the sample size for the study was not calculated based on statistical assumptions and random sampling was not always followed.\n\nInformation and interview biases might be introduced because traders sometimes appeared worried about legal action if they provided accurate information. However, it was ensured that the authors maintained the confidentiality of the information. As information on the breed and sex of the animals was not recorded, a limitation is that the authors do not know if and how these factors influenced the findings of the study.\n\nMeasurements of space allocation per animal in the vehicle might not have been as precise as the authors would have liked. The diagnostic error might have occurred as the diagnostic tests that the authors used were not 100 per cent sensitive and 100 per cent specific.\n\nThe transportation system for animals in Bangladesh is marked by a lack of oversight or regulation, where animals can be subject to cruelty and rough handling. The frequency of the different types of injuries such as abrasion, barbed wire injuries, scarification, laceration and so on with the degree of severity in the cattle increased after transportation. The high stocking density of the cattle made to stand in the vehicle, in addition to feed and water deprivation, was recorded during transportation. Only paddy straw and a small amount of drinking water were offered to the animals at the destination market. The high frequency and severity of injuries, poor health conditions and enormous haemato-biochemical changes during transportation clearly reflect the poor welfare of the cattle during transportation in Bangladesh.\n\nCattle stocking density limits in vehicles, ventilation facilities, and provision of quality feed and water should be ensured during long-distance transportation to prevent the incidence of different types of cattle injuries, respiratory problem, diarrhoea, dehydration, immune-suppression, and detrimental haemato-biochemical and hormonal changes with the aim of preserving animal welfare. Necessary government rules and regulations should be developed and implemented in practice, along with conducting traders\u2019 education and incentive programmes to ensure animal welfare in Bangladesh."}
