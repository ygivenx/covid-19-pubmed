The widespread effect of this pandemic and its influence on the practice of orthopaedic surgery and musculoskeletal work is the subject of this work. We discuss the issues revolving personal protection of musculoskeletal (MSK) healthcare workers, non-operative management of musculoskeletal conditions, remote consultations, trauma escalation stages, staff wellbeing and orthopaedic surgery for COVID-19 cases.\n\nPersonal protection at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic is prime consideration for health workers, employers, department of health and patients. This issue is important to ensure the heath and well being of the personnel caring for musculoskeletal (MSK) patients, and also key for organisations to ensure continuity of patient care. MSK teams deal with a huge proportion of patients in the primary and secondary care. The aim of this document is to provide guidance towards personal protection for this group of health workers in a patient facing role, and secondarily to briefly review controversial topics and treatments. It would therefore be applicable to surgeons, radiologists, rheumatologists, nurses, physiotherapists, advanced practitioners, radiographers, ward clerks, receptionists, cleaning teams, porters, phlebotomists, pharmacists and all allied health professionals.\n\nThe spread of SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly via droplets (aerosol), but also via direct contact with contaminated surfaces (fomites). Any personal prophylaxis needs to consider both these modes. Also, one needs to consider the viral load to which the health worker is exposed which in turn influences the severity of disease, if acquired.\n\nAerosol (droplets from the patient's mouth or nose) spread from an infected patient to the health worker via a direct aerosol assault can vary in quantum from low level contamination -from encounters such as talking -to high level contamination -via coughing or sneezing. Such aerosol entry may be via the nose, mouth or eyes of the recipient. The distance of the source to the recipient influences the quantum. A safe distance of 6 feet is recommended when possible to minimize such aerosol spread during clinical encounters 1 . SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in aerosols for up to three hours 2 and hence aerated rooms are safer than closed spaces. Regular ventilation of closed spaces is advisable.\n\nA wide variety of aerosol filters (face masks) are available and sometimes the nomenclature can be challenging to understand 2 . The two main variables one needs to consider when one decides to choose such a mask is the filter efficiency and whether it provides an airtight fit around the personnel's mouth and nose. Filter efficiency is tested by assessing the proportion of a 300 nanometer (0.3 microns) aerosol challenge, which is filtered by the device. To understand the nomenclature mentioned in the following Now, the size of coronavirus is around 100 nanometers (0.1 microns) 4 and hence simple mathematics would suggest that these particles would pass through most of these filters, which are tested for a 300nm particle challenge. However, particles smaller than 300nm do not travel in a linear motion but travel in a zig-zag movement as they are bounced randomly by molecules of comprising air (Brownian motion) 2 .\n\nHence these particles are often trapped in filters with mesh sizes bigger than themselves. N95 masks are recommended for medium risk clinical encounters. For high-risk encounters, positive pressure suits are recommended 2, 5 .\n\nMany of the re-usable commercially available Facemasks (respirators) for protection during spray painting / woodwork / industrial fumes are FFP3 /P3 category and would offer protection against a heavy viral aerosol challenge. However, most of these are not easy to sterilize and neither licensed for medical use. There is a risk of the virus staying alive on the respirator surface (up to 3 days on plastic) 6 and hence their repeated use cannot be recommended in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It may be too expensive for these to be used on a disposable basis (approximately \u00a3100 cost per piece), but in case of dire shortage of supplies, and if they can be massproduced in the country, they will have a potential role in clinical encounters such as the subject of this document.\n\nSurgical face masks are not designed for personnel protection and do not closely fit around the face and mouth. Their design is intended for preventing contamination of the surgical wound from the aerosols generating by the surgical team. When tested for personal protection, in lab settings, they provide a 35% protection against a standard lab aerosol challenge 3 . There are no clinical studies comparing N95/P2 masks to surgical masks for prevention against coronavirus but studies have compared these two masks in the setting of influenza virus (which is a similar sized virus and is also airborne) 7 . Despite the differences we have seen in the lab settings, there seem to be no difference in infection rates between these two groups in the clinical setting (2 randomised trials). It is apparent that in the lab setting N95/P2 masks are superior but in the clinical setting such a difference is not seen.\n\nAlso, there is evidence to suggest that wearing a mask (either surgical mask or N95) reduces the risks of acquiring the 'flu by the close contacts of patients when compared to no protection (3 arm randomised trial) 8 , Medical Research Council (Imperial College) suggests the use of masks can reduce the chances of developing disease, but notes that the compliance may be poor 7 .\n\nIn light of the above evidence, it can be inferred that the surgical masks are not a reliable protection against a known/suspected COVID-19 patient, but they are useful to prevent the personnel against an accidental aerosol challenge from an asymptomatic carrier of SARS-CoV-2 during the incubation phase. Equally if a health worker is in the asymptomatic incubation phase, this will reduce the aerosol challenge towards an uninfected patient or coworker 5, 7 . By reducing the viral load acquired, such facemasks are protective for personnel as they are likely to reduce the severity of illness, especially at the height of the pandemic.\n\nIt is recommended that a known patient of COVID-19 wears such a mask to reduce viral shedding and hence this measure is protective to the health workers. These masks are also useful for symptomatic patients in self-quarantine to reduce viral load transmission to the rest of the members of family in quarantine.\n\nAerosols/droplet contamination via the eye can be prevented by routine use of glasses or visors 6 . Such protection would be useful when a direct aerosol challenge may occur such as clinic appointments, reception staff, clinical examination, physiotherapy, phlebotomy, radiology procedures etc.\n\nDirect contact with contaminated surfaces may also lead to inoculation, for example when the health worker examines the patient and then uses the contaminated hand to rub one's eye or touch their face. SARS-CoV-2 is detectable for up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel 6 .\n\nHence hand washing with soap and water or disinfecting gel is advisable before and after every patient contact. A direct decontamination of all patient contact points is vital (chairs, door knobs, pens, clipboards etc.) many times each day. It is advisable to avoid touching one's eyes nose or mouth. It is advisable to cough or sneeze in a tissue and bin the tissue immediately. If tissue is not immediately available, it is best to cough and sneeze into the elbow 9 .\n\nThe hospital should be divided into areas affiliated with a level of risk 10 .\n\nLevel 1 -Applicable to pre-exam triage and general outpatient dept \u2022 Eye protection is recommended for all clinical encounters.\n\n\u2022 Hand washing with soap and water or disinfecting gel is advisable before and after every patient contact.\n\n\u2022 A direct decontamination of all patient / staff contact points is vital (chairs, door knobs, pens, clipboards, keyboard, mouse etc) many times during the working day.\n\n\u2022 It is advisable to avoid touching one's eyes, nose or mouth. It is advisable to cough or sneeze in a tissue and bin the tissue immediately. If tissue is not immediately available, it is best to cough and sneeze into the elbow.\n\n\u2022 Minimize personnel entering operating theatre.\n\n\u2022 Ideally have a negative pressure operating area, a buffer zone and a clean zone.\n\n\u2022 Put PPE on in the buffer zone; dispose of it in the buffer zone.\n\n\u2022 Patients should have surgical masks and caps on.\n\nIdeally divide into teams, with each team only being in a Level 2 or Level 3 area for 4h at a time 10 .\n\nThe hospital should have a 'fever clinic' running. i.e. anyone who enters A&E or MIU will have their temperature taken. Those with a fever are taken to a 'fever clinic' for further assessment: this is a level 2 zone.\n\nThere is no clear-cut guidance specifically related to staff with comorbidities.\n\nHowever, comorbidities that place individuals at greatest risk are:\n\n\u2022 Hypertension\n\n\u2022 Cardiac disease/ cerebrovascular disease\n\n\u2022 Respiratory disease 11\n\n\u2022 Malignancy and immunodeficiency\n\n\u2022 Those treated with ACE-2 inhibitors are at greater risk 12 COPD is the most strongly predictive comorbidity for both severe disease and ICU admission 13\n\nLong acting corticosteroid injections are often used in musculoskeletal conditions to control pain and relieve localised inflammation. There is concern regarding the use of such injections during a Pandemic as it may depress the immune system. Non steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) have been linked with a more sever form of COVID19\n\nMethylprednisolone has been linked to prolonged viral shedding 14 and WHO advises against their use in COVID-19 except for patients with an associated acute respiratory distress. General corticosteroids have led to delayed viral shedding in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, as well as psychosis and avascular necrosis in SARS-CoV and increased mortality in influenza 15 .\n\nIn addition, a previous study of over 15 ,000 cases showed that intra articular steroid administration reduces the efficacy of the influenza vaccine and suggest susceptibility to viral load 16 .\n\nTo date there are no papers specifically looking at intra articular steroid administration in Coronavirus strain COVID-19, but the advice from WHO regarding steroids is to avoid them unless the patient is in ARDS 17 .\n\nThe current advice is not to take NSAIDs in COVID-19 and to use paracetamol to treat symptoms 18 . There is speculation that the drug causes \"cytokine storms\". Taking the drug in the early stages of the disease may induce prolonged illness or more severe respiratory or cardiac complications.\n\nThe effectiveness of virtual fracture clinics in the UK is now well-established [19] [20] [21] .\n\nThe same research has not been done for elective orthopaedics. Certainly from a follow-up perspective, the virtual clinic is encouraged from the Royal College of GMC has some guidance on this, but it is limited. They suggest ensuring the patient being assessed has capacity, has a straightforward treatment request and that the clinician has all the necessary patient information to hand.\n\nEach hospital will have its own escalation plan, but in the first instance it is desirable for specialist teams to work within their own remit, but working in emergency mode.\n\nFor example, orthopaedic surgeons could staff trauma lists, fracture clinics and minor injuries units to treat the walking wounded. At some point however people will have to work outside their comfort zone.\n\nThere are studies emerging about the effects of this rapidly spreading disease on the mental health of health workers. It is important that we support each other and recognise that every one is working outside of their comfort zone. Ensure rest and respite between shifts, eat sufficiently and stay in regular contact with friends, family and colleagues.\n\nAt some point soon, orthopaedic surgeons may have to step outside the comfort zone of trauma and orthopaedics and treat and triage any patient entering A&E. The Royal\n\nCollege of Surgeons has outlined this in its \"Guidance for surgeons\" and has set out 5 key phases:\n\n1) Triage and deliver healthcare and protect the workforce \n\nThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors."}
