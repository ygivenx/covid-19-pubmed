SARS-CoV 3CLpro is functionally analogous to the main picornaviral protease 3Cpro and there have been significant drug-design efforts against human rhinoviral 3C protease which is also a cysteine protease. 10 We recently described structurebased design of a number of potent SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors. 11 These inhibitors were designed based upon modification of AG7088, a potent inhibitor of the human rhinoviral 3C protease. 12 While AG7088 does not exhibit inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CLpro, the modified inhibitors are active in enzymatic assays as well as in cell culture assays. 13 The X-ray structure of inhibitor-bound SARS-3CLpro revealed important molecular insight into the ligand-binding sites of enzyme. 11 The inhibitors bind to SARS-CoV-3CLpro through covalent bonding with the active site cysteine 145 residue. Based upon this molecular insight, we have now modified our initial inhibitors to accommodate specific ligand-binding site interactions in the S 4 -subsite of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro active site. Herein we describe the synthesis, biological evaluation and X-ray structures of inhibitor-bound SARS-CoV-3CLpro for two potent peptide and peptide-mimetic inhibitors.\n\nAs described previously, inhibitor 2 makes a number of important interactions in the enzyme active site. 11 These include, the covalent bond formed by the Cys-145 thiol with the \u03b1, \u03b2unsaturated ester at the S1-subsite. His-172 makes hydrogen-bond with the P1-lactam-NH, and the Glu-166 nitrogen makes a hydrogen bond with the ketone of the inhibitor. 11 The P4oxazole group appears to fill in the S 4 -hydrophobic pocket. Based upon this X-ray structure, we subsequently speculated that the replacement of P 4 -oxazole with a Boc-Serine P 4 -ligand would promote additional hydrogen-bonding interactions in the S 4 -site. This will result in further enhancement of inhibitory potency. We have also evaluated the corresponding peptidederived inhibitors for our studies.\n\nThe syntheses of inhibitor 3 is outlined in Scheme 1. The synthetic procedure of silyl ether derivative 6 was described by us previously. 11 Removal of the silyl protecting group with tetrabutylammonium fluoride in THF provided a secondary alcohol, which was oxidized to ketone 7 with Dess-Martin periodinane in 73% yield over 2 steps. The ketone 7 was converted to inhibitor 3 by exposure to trifluoroacetic acid (20% TFA/CH 2 Cl 2 ) followed by coupling of the resulting amine with Boc-(L)-Serine to provide 3 in 72% yield.\n\nThe synthesis of peptide-based inhibitors are summarized in Scheme 2. General peptide coupling reactions between (S)-valine and (S)-leucine or (S)-phenylalanine followed by ester hydrolysis gave the carboxylic acid intermediates 10 and 11 in 81% and 90% yields respectively. Coupling of these acids with lactam fragment 12 11,14 afforded Boc-derivatives 13 and 14 in 89% and 86% yields respectively. Exposure of these compounds to TFA effected the removal of the Boc-group to provide the corresponding free amines. Coupling of these amines with Boc-(L)-serine furnished inhibitors 4 and 5 in 55% and 95% yields respectively. Furthermore, reaction of the 13 or 14-derived amines with 5-methylisoxazole-3-carboxylic acid 15 15 afforded inhibitors 16 (75%) and 17 (81%) in very good yields.\n\nThe inhibitory activities of the synthetic inhibitors are shown in Table 1 . The enzyme inhibitory activity of the compounds against SARS-CoV-3CLpro was determined in a FRET-based, microplate assay described by Grum-Tokars and co-workers 11,16 and used for the determination of IC 50 values for \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated esters. 17 The assays were performed in 96well microplates using a reaction volume of 100 \u03bcL which contained 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 nM SARS-CoV-3CLpro enzyme and varying concentrations of synthetic inhibitors. The reaction components, with the exception of substrate, were incubated for 20 minutes and the reaction was initiated by the addition of FRET-substrate [AlexaFluor\u00ae 488-cys]-Glu-Ser-Ala-Thr-Leu-Gln-Ser-Gly-Leu-Ala-[Lys-QSY\u00ae-7]-Ser, giving a final substrate concentration of 1 \u03bcM. 11,16 The IC 50 values for inhibitors were determined by measuring the rates of reaction with increasing inhibitor concentrations. As shown in Table 1 , our structure-based incorporation of P 4 -Boc ser in place of P 4 -oxazole in inhibitor 2 resulted in (inhibitor 3) significant enhancement of enzymatic inhibitory potency, while its antiviral activity was not improved. It exhibited antiviral activity similar to inhibitors 1 and 2. This difference of activity may be due to the presence of peptide-like features in the inhibitors. Peptide-like molecules often exhibit poor passive transcellular diffusion across cell membranes. Antiviral assays followed our previously published protocol. 11, 18 We have compared the binding affinity of the corresponding peptide-based inhibitors incorporating both P 4 -oxazole and P 4 -Boc ser. Peptide-based inhibitors (4 and 5) with P 2 -Leu and P 2 -Phe have displayed 20-fold enzymatic potency enhancement over the respective inhibitors (16 and 17) containing P 4 -oxazole.\n\nTo obtain molecular insight into the binding properties of inhibitor 3, we determined the Xray structure of 3-bound to SARS-CoV 3CLpro to a resolution of 1.9 \u00c5. 19 The refinement statistics and data collection are summarized in Table 2 . A stereoview of the inhibitor-bound structure is shown in Figure 2 . The X-ray structure reveals that the inhibitor is covalently bonded to the enzyme via a C-S bond (1.77 \u00c5) to the active site cysteine (Cys-145). The P\u00b41ethyl ester carbonyl is within proximity to Thr-26 oxygen (3.38\u00c5). The Leu-27 side-chain makes hydrophobic contacts with P\u00b41-ligand. Furthermore, the P 1 -lactam NH forms a hydrogen bond with the imidazole ring of His-163. The P 3 -carbonyl group of 3 forms a hydrogen bond with the NH of Glu-166. The P 4 -Ser side chain is within hydrogen-bonding distance of Glu 166. This may explain its enhanced binding affinity over the oxazole bearing-inhibitor 2.\n\nIn conclusion, our structure-based design strategies resulted in significant improvement in enzyme inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CLpro. An X-ray structure of the 3-bound enzyme provided critical molecular insight into the ligand-binding site interactions in the active site. It appears that the P 4 -Boc-Ser is involved in important hydrogen-bonding interactions in the S' 4 -subsite. The present molecular insight will facilitate the design of more effective inhibitors. Further investigations are in progress.\n\nwas incubated with 1 mM inhibitor on ice for 1 hour prior to crystallization which was conducted by mixing 5 \u03bcL enzyme and 1 \u03bcL of mother liquor solution and allowing the mixture to undergo vapor diffusion against 11% PEG20,000, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Na-cacodylate, pH 6.5. Single crystals grew within 3 hours and were cryoprotected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data were collected using a MAR-CCD detector at SER-CAT beamline 22-BM at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Data were indexed with HKL2000 and scaled and merged with SCALEPACK (Otwinowski and Minor, 1997). 20 The structure was determined via molecular replacement using the coordinates 2ALV from the PDB (Ghosh et al., 2005) 11 and refined with REFMAC from the CCP4 suite (Collaborative, 1994). R-factors were minimized by an additional 4-5% by using 10 cycles of TLS refinement on 19 segments.
