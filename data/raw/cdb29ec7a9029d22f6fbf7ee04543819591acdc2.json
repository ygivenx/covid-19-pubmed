{"title": "Additional file 2 -Estimation of divergence time", "body": "2 Five Singaporean isolates (SIN2500, SIN2677, SIN2679, SIN2748, and SIN2774):\n\nSIN2500 was the primary index patient in Singapore and directly linked to index patient A in Hong Kong. SIN2677, SIN 2748, SIN2774, and SINxxxx (this patient was unavailable) were the four primary contacts and SIN2679 was the secondary contact of SINxxxx [9] . For those isolates, all patients have \"history of close contact with another patient with SARS or travel to a region with documented community transmission of SARS within 10 days of onset of symptoms\", and clinical samples are \"obtained form the patients between 0 and 11 days after of onset of symptoms\" (see [9] ). Therefore, the time for the SIN2500 was estimated to be between 7 days (mean incubation time) and 21 (10 + 11) days. Because of the close clinical relationship, we estimated the minimum incubation period 2 days [10] for SIN2677, SIN2748, SIN2774, and SINxxxx, and maximum 13 (2 + 11) days. For SIN2679, the estimated range is likewise to be 2 and 13 days from SINxxxx.\n\nBefore we finished the data analysis, we did not find a formal report of the clinical relationship and sample isolation dates for these three isolates. The specimens were probably isolated before April 2, two weeks before the sequences were released in mid-April, 2003. Therefore, we used the divergence time from 12 days (7 incubation days + 5 hospital admission days) to 41 days The estimated divergence time between each pair of sequences is shown in Table S1 and S2 and the proportion of nucleotide difference is shown in Table S3 .
