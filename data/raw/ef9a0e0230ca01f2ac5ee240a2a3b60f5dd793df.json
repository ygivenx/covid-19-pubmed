{"title": "", "body": "The PLP1s of the coronaviruses were first aligned with the SARS-CoV-PLpro amino acid sequence using ClustalW [19] . The result was manually checked and edited to make sure that the key residues identified from the structure of the 315aa region of the minimal core domain (actual amino acid sequence numbers) of SARS-CoV-PLpro, namely W107 (W1646), N110\n\n(N1649), C112 (C1651), Y113 (Y1652), L163 (L1702), G164 (G1703), D165 (D1704), E168\n\n(E1707), Y265 (Y1804), G267 (G1806), G272 (G1811), H273 (H1812), Y274 (Y1813) and D287 (D1826), were aligned correctly with the other seven coronaviral PLP1s. This multiple sequence alignment was named Profile1. Next, the PLP2s of the coronaviruses, along with aIBV and the BtCoV-PLPs were aligned to the SARS-CoV-PLpro sequence (with special attention given to the 14 residues noted above) to obtain a second alignment termed Profile2. ClustalX [19] was then used to perform a profile alignment between Profile1 and Profile2 to conserve the alignments within the individual profiles and yet align them with each other. Profile alignment works much better among the PLpro amino acid sequences since the low sequence identity barely preserves the alignment of the important residues among the family, especially among the PLP1s and PLP2s. To our knowledge, this type of profile aligning approach has not been used in any prior work. The resulting multiple sequence alignment shows that even though the overall sequence identity in the coronaviral protease domain is very low (highest being ~30%) , the amino acids likely to participate in the catalytic core are highly conserved. The multiple sequence alignment of coronavirus papain-like protease (PLP) core domains shows the active site conserved residues highlighted in yellow starting with W107 of SARS-CoV-PLpro that stabilizes the oxyanion hole. The catalytic cysteine, histidine and aspartic acid are completely conserved among all PLPs. The residues highlighted in yellow are the 14 residues that are studied in detail among all the coronaviruses for cluster generation and classification studies. Besides these, the four Zn-chelating cysteines intermittently substituted by a histidine in 229E-PLP2, NL63-PLP2 and TGEV-PLP2 are highlighted in magenta. Additional residues such as N111 and Q122 that are also totally conserved among all the PLPs, but are not present in the active site; the residues corresponding to P249 or T302 that participates in the formation of the hydrophobic crevice that is balanced by leucine in the S4 substrate position of LXGG are highlighted in green. The arrows point to the key SARS-CoV-PLpro residues (all residue numbering is referenced to the 316-amino-acid catalytic core domain of PLpro, Ratia et al.\n\nP2 Bt133  PLP1693  EAKLLHTLLAKAELTVSAKMVWREWCTVCGIRDIEYT-GMR-ACVYA-GVNS--M-EELQSVFN--BtHKU9 PLP1599  MVLSAVLNHG--TVTA--RRVMQTVCEHCGVSQMVFT-GTD-ACTFY-GSVV--L-DDLYAPVS-V  MHVJ  P2 1772  DF-IRVELRE--ADLSGATCDLEFICK-CGVKQ-EQRKGVD-AVMHF-GTLD--KSGLVK-GYN--HKU1  P2 1813  DF-IRVVLKQ--ADLSGAICELELICD-CGIKQ-ESRVGVD-AVMHF-GTLA--KTDLFN-GYK--BCoV  P2 1727  DF-LRVVFSQ--VDLTGAICDFEIACK-CGVKQ-EQRTGVD-AVMHF-GTLS--REDLEI-GYT-V  OC43  P2 1727  DF-LRVVFSQ--VDLTGAICDFEIACK-CGVKQ-EQRTGLD-AVMHF-GTLS--REDLEI-GYT-V  229E  p2 1756  EDTL-TKLSKYLANEAQVQLEHYSSCVECDAKFKNSVASINSAIVCASVK- "}
