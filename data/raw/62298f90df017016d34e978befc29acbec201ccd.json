{"title": "The alkyl side chain of PACA nanoparticles dictates the impact on cellular stress responses and the mode of particle-induced cell death", "body": "The fact that many normally 'inert' materials become substantially more reactive when downsized to NPs can be beneficial in nanomedicine, but also give rise to nanotoxicity [1] .\n\nIntracellular uptake of NPs into lysosomes, or even NP binding to the cell surface, has been shown to activate cellular stress responses, such as oxidative stress or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [2] [3] [4] , as illustrated in Figure 1A . In NP-mediated drug delivery, cellular stress pathways that are induced as a response to the nanocarrier itself may be beneficial if these stress responses sensitize the target cells. A variety of NPs have been shown to alter the cellular redox balance either by overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or by depleting the cellular reserve of the main ROS scavenger molecule, reduced glutathione (GSH) [2] . To regain redox homeostasis, an antioxidant response is initiated by activation of transcription factors like Nrf2, HIF1, NF\uf06bB, or ATF4, which leads to increased expression of proteins with antioxidant properties [5, 6] . ER stress is characterized by disruption of ER lumen homeostasis, which leads to accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. This activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), an adaptive pathway that aims to clear unfolded proteins and restore ER homeostasis [7] . A diversity of NPs has been reported to induce accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins or activate the UPR [3] .\n\nBoth the UPR and the antioxidant response are initially pro-survival pathways induced to regain cellular homeostasis. However, if the insult is too severe or prolonged the antioxidant response can no longer protect the cells, and the UPR response is switched to a pro-death pathway [8] . Thus, NP-induced stress pathways are two-faced; they may positively contribute to the intended NP-based therapy in certain settings, but may also prevent an optimal effect in others. Moreover, excessive stress responses may give rise to NP supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \uf06dg/ml streptomycin at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO 2 . All cells were seeded one day prior to the experiments. For inhibitor studies, cells were pretreated with the inhibitor at the indicated concentration for 30 minutes before addition of PACA particles. The cellular ATP level (as a surrogate for viability) was measured using the CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) and cell death was measured by the CellTox\u2122 Green Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's procedures. Both luminescence and fluorescence were measured by a Synergy2 plate reader (BioTek). Cystine-free medium was prepared by supplementing DMEM without cystine and methionine (#21013, Gibco) with L-methionine (200 \u00b5M), 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mM GlutaMAX\u2122 (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \uf06dg/ml streptomycin. Determination of protein synthesis was performed after 4 hours of treatment with PACA particles, by incubating the cells with leucine-free HEPES-buffered medium complemented with 2 \u03bcCi/ml [ 3 H]leucine (PerkinElmer) at 37\u00b0C for 20 min before proteins were precipitated with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and washed once with the same solution.\n\nFinally, the proteins were dissolved in 0.1 M KOH and radioactively labeled leucineincorporation was quantified by \u03b2-counting with a Tri-Carb 2100TR \u00ae Liquid Scintillation Analyzer (Packard Bioscience).\n\nFor preparation of total cell lysates treated cells were washed with PBS and lysed directly in 1.1 x Laemmli sample buffer. The lysate was boilt and sonicated briefly to reduce viscosity.\n\nLysates were separated by 4-20% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane.

To include detached cells, the medium was aspirated and centrifuged at 10,000 x g and resulting pellets combined with cell lysates. Crude cell extracts were sonicated and centrifuged to remove cell debris.

Cells treated with PACA NPs for 4 hours were labeled with C11-BODIPY (2.5 \u00b5M, 30 minutes). Subsequently, the stained cells were harvested by Accutase\u00ae Cell Detachment Solution (Sigma-Aldrich), pelleted, resuspended in PBS and subjected to flow cytometry analysis. The dye was excited using a 488 nm Ar laser and detected with the FL1 (545 nm) detector on an LSR II Flow Cytometer (BD Bioscience). At least 10 000 cells were acquired for each measurement. \n\nSmall interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were introduced into MDA-MB-231 cells by reverse transfection. The siRNAs were diluted in RPMI and mixed with Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen) before addition to trypsinized cells at a final siRNA-concentration of 10 nM. 3 x 10 5 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates, and the culture medium was exchanged the next day. The experimental treatments were initiated after 48 h of transfection. The following siRNAs were used (Silencer Select siRNAs from Ambion): Silencer \u00ae Select Negative Control #1 (4390843), siPERK-1 (ID 18103), siPERK-2 (ID 18101), siATF4-1 (ID 1702), siATF4-2 (ID 1704), siHRI-1 (ID 25822), siHRI-2 (ID 25823), siNrf2-1 (ID 9492), siNrf2-2 (ID 9493), siSLC7A11-1 (ID 24289), siSLC7A11-2 (ID 24291), siPKR-1 (ID 11185), siPKR-2 (ID 11186), or ON-TARGETplus Non-targeting siRNA #1(D-001810-01-05), ON-TARGET plus siGCN2-1 (J-005314-07-0010) and siGCN2-2 (J-005314-06-0010) from Dharmacon. In the quadruple knockdown of ISR kinases 10 nM of each of the following siRNAs were included: siPERK-1, siGCN2-2, siPKR-1, siHRI-1. This was compared to 40 nM of negative control siRNA. In the double knockdown of ATF4 and Nrf2, 10 nM of each siRNA (siATF4-1 and siNrf2-2) was mixed and compared to 20 nM of negative control siRNA.\n\nPhase contrast images were acquired by an Eclipse TS100 microscope (Nikon) equipped with a 20x objective and a Digital Sight camera (Nikon).

The resulting particles exhibited similar mean sizes, in the range of 133-153 nm, with a relatively narrow size distribution. All three NPs were slightly negatively charged with a zeta-potential of approximately -3 mV ( Figure 1B ). When particle cytotoxicity was compared across a panel of cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, SW480, Huh7, HCT116, MCF7, and HeLa) the POCA particles consistently exerted the highest cytotoxicity, whereas PEBCA particles were the least toxic ( Figure 1C ). This is in agreement with our previous screening study with a set of 12 other cancer cell lines [11] . Importantly, we have found that this pattern of cytotoxicity is not caused by gross differences in cellular uptake of the particles [11, 18] . To assess whether the differential PACA cytotoxicity is caused by particle-specific induction of cellular stress responses, we focused on the triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 that displayed the largest diversity in particle cytotoxicity ( Figure 1C ).\n\nWe first assessed whether the PACA particles would induce accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, a hallmark of altered cellular homeostasis [7] . When cells were treated with 25 \u00b5g/ml (an intermediary concentration with respect to cytotoxicity at 24 hours) of each variant of PACA NPs, a buildup of ubiquitinated proteins was observed within the first 4 hours of treatment in all cell lines tested ( Figure 1D Figure 1B) .

During ER stress, accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen activates PERK, and subsequently, global protein synthesis is shut down via phosphorylation, and thus inactivation, of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2\u03b1) [7] . This allows for preferential translation of UPRdependent genes, such as the activating transcriptional factor 4 (ATF4), which initiates transcription of genes encoding ER chaperones, amino acid transporters, and antioxidant proteins that contribute to restoration of cellular homeostasis [7] . Intriguingly, the three variants of PACA NPs induced a highly different UPR activation pattern ( Figure 2B This might suggest that eIF2\u03b1 is predominantly phosphorylated by an alternative kinase in PBCA-treated cells. To assess whether the particles activate the IRE1 ER stress pathway, we probed for the IRE1 downstream target XBP1s [7] . An accumulation of XBP1s was detected author/funder. All rights reserved.

Together, this suggests that ER stress is induced by the POCA particles, and also by PEBCA particles at high concentrations, but not by PBCA particles.\n\nAccumulation of the transcription factor ATF4 can not only be observed as a response to ER stress and PERK activation, but also downstream of three other eIF2\u03b1 kinases, GCN2, PKR and HRI, through the so-called integrated stress response (ISR) [19] , as illustrated in Figure   2E . These kinases sense various internal or external stressors, including amino acid starvation, viral infection, proteasomal inhibition, and redox imbalance [19] . In order to see whether the PBCA-induced ATF4 accumulation is mediated via the ISR, we employed the recently developed ISR inhibitor ISRIB, which blocks all downstream effects of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 [20] ( Figure 2E ). Indeed, the PBCA-induced accumulation of ATF4 was inhibited by ISRIB ( Figure 2F -G). Thapsigargin was used as a positive control for ISR-induction [21] . In an attempt to identify the specific ISR kinase responsible for the PBCA-induced stress response, the four kinases were depleted separately by siRNAs.

Cellular ROS levels were significantly increased by both PEBCA and PBCA, whereas only a slight tendency of an increase, that did not reach statistical significance, was observed with POCA ( Figure 3A ). We chose PBCA particles to analyze the nature of this effect further. The main cellular antioxidant, reduced GSH, was partially depleted upon treatment with PBCA ( Figure 3B ).\n\nThus, PBCA clearly induced redox imbalance, and this seemed to trigger the downstream stress responses, as treatment with excess GSH prevented PBCA-induced accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, and accumulation of ATF4 ( Figure 3C -F).\n\nAlso the cytotoxicity of PBCA particles was fully reversed by either excess GSH or NAC, a precursor of GSH [22] ( Figure 3G ). In contrast, POCA cytotoxicity was not prevented by antioxidant treatment ( Figure 3G ), pointing to a fundamental difference in the cytotoxic action of these particles.\n\nIntrigued by these findings, we aimed to identify the mode of cell death induced by the three PACA particle variants. Strikingly, only POCA particles induced an apoptotic phenotype, identified by membrane blebbing, apoptotic bodies and nuclear fragmentation already after 4 hours of treatment ( Figure 4A The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/304618 doi: bioRxiv preprint activation, as detected by the fluorogenic CellEvent\u2122 caspase 3/7 substrate ( Figure 4D , Supplementary videos 1-3). Finally, treatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD significantly counteracted POCA cytotoxicity, whereas PBCA cytotoxicity was unchanged ( Figure 4E ), demonstrating that the highly similar PACA particles induce different modes of cell death.\n\nAs permeabilization of the lysosomal membrane has been observed upon treatment with certain NPs [23], it was of interest to see whether the PACA particles induce lysosomal damage. To this end we employed HeLa cells stably expressing mCherry-Galectin-3, a commonly used system for detection of lysosomal permeabilization [24] . As expected, the positive control L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLOMe), a lysosomotropic detergent-like substance [24] , rapidly induced numerous mCherry-Galectin-3 puncta ( Figure 4F ). In contrast, the PACA particles, even at high concentrations and prolonged treatment, did not induce evident galectin-3 staining stronger than the background level ( Figure 4F , Supplementary videos 4-7). The only exception was galectin-3 puncta appearing in POCAtreated cells several hours after initiation of membrane blebbing, likely as a secondary event of apoptosis. Thus, it seems unlikely that lysosomal membrane permeabilization is the initial event responsible for PACA-induced cell death.\n\nWe next asked what type of non-apoptotic cell death may be induced by PBCA. In recent years, the term necrosis has been subdivided into a plethora of differentially regulated necrotic cell death pathways [25] . A recently discovered subtype of regulated necrosis, called ferroptosis, is associated with accumulation of ROS in an iron-dependent manner, loss of GSH, and excessive lipid peroxidation [13, 14] . As PBCA cytotoxicity seemed to depend on author/funder. All rights reserved.

Remarkably, PBCA cytotoxicity was almost totally reversed by the ferroptosis inhibitors ( Figure 5A-B) . Also the iron chelator deferiprone (DFP) abolished PBCA cytotoxicity, further implicating ferroptosis, whereas the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD had no significant effect. As ferroptosis is characterized by lipid peroxidation, we measured the extent of peroxidated lipids by employing the probe BODIPY-C11. Indeed, treatment with PBCA particles induced lipid peroxidation in a liproxstatin-sensitive manner ( Figure 5C ).\n\nThe cellular import of cystine is identified as one of the key regulators of ferroptosis [14] . Imported cystine is converted to cysteine, which is the rate-limiting substrate in GSH synthesis. Thus, cystine availability is an important determinant of cellular redox capacity.\n\nWe thus asked how cystine availability affects PACA cytotoxicity. Strikingly, when MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated in medium lacking only cystine, potent cell death was induced by significantly lower PBCA concentrations than those required to induce cytotoxicity in full medium ( Figure 5D -E). The cystine starvation-induced cell death, and importantly also the cell death induced by PBCA particles in cystine-free medium, was fully inhibited by the ferroptosis inhibitors ferrostatin, liproxstatin, or DFP, or by re-addition of cystine ( Figure 5D -E), whereas z-VAD had no effect. Surprisingly, in cystine-free medium even the relatively non-cytotoxic PEBCA particles exerted potent ferroptosis-dependent cytotoxicity ( Figure 5D -E). To test whether the increased vulnerability towards these two PACA particles was caused by a lower antioxidant capacity in cystine-starved cells, the cellular GSH levels were measured. Indeed, four hours of cystine starvation was sufficient to partially reduce the level of GSH ( Figure 5F ), and low concentrations of PEBCA and PBCA particles (12.5 \u00b5g/ml) author/funder.

Concomitant with loss of GSH, low concentrations of PEBCA and PBCA significantly induced lipid ROS generation in cells starved for cystine ( Figure 5G ). Taken together, both PEBCA and PBCA seem to have the ability to induce ferroptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells, depending on cystine availability and the resulting cellular antioxidant capacity.\n\nAs treatment with PBCA particles potently induced accumulation of ATF4 in a GSHdependent manner ( Figure 3C Importantly, both PEBCA and PBCA particles induced partly ATF4-dependent transcription of SLC7A11 ( Figure 5L ), the light-chain subunit of the cystine-glutamate antiporter Xc-, which is responsible for cystine import and regarded as a guardian of the antioxidant defense pathway [14] .\n\nAs PEBCA and PBCA particles exert comparable cytotoxicity upon cystine starvation ( Figure 5E ), whereas the particle cytotoxicity is highly different in complete cell medium ( Figure 1C ), the question remains whether the PEBCA particles have the ability to activate author/funder.

Nrf2 is a master transcriptional activator of cytoprotective genes in response to electrophiles and oxidants [27] . Normally, Nrf2 levels are kept low by ubiquitination via the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor Keap1, but the presence of cytotoxic substances blocks the interaction to Keap1 and thus prevents Nrf2 degradation [6] .\n\nInterestingly, PEBCA particles more potently activated Nrf2 than PBCA particles; whereas the maximum PBCA-induced Nrf2 activation was reached already at 25 \u00b5g/ml and then decreased at higher concentrations, Nrf2 was accumulated in a dose-dependent manner by PEBCA particles (Figure 6A-B) , resembling the transcriptional activation of ATF4 ( Figure   5I ). This reduced ability to activate cell protective responses at elevated PBCA concentrations may contribute to the differential cytotoxicity of the two particles.\n\nTo investigate whether Nrf2 exerts a protective role in PEBCA/PBCA cytotoxicity, the transcription factor was depleted by siRNA ( Figure 6C ). Knockdown of Nrf2 rendered the cells highly sensitive to both PEBCA and PBCA particles ( Figure 6D Figure 6G ). Nrf2 has been shown to induce ATF4 transcription during oxidative stress [28, 29] . In line with the significant activation of Nrf2, PEBCA particles induced ATF4 transcription in an Nrf2-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure 5B) , in this way connecting these stress pathways.\n\nSeveral of the transcriptional targets of Nrf2 are relevant in protection against ferroptosis, such as heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), ferritin heavy chain (FTH1) involved in author/funder.

Transcription of several of these targets was potently induced by both PEBCA and PBCA in an Nrf2-dependent manner ( Figure 6H, Supplementary Figure 5C \n\nFrom the above data, the PBCA particles more significantly reduced cellular antioxidant capacity than PEBCA particles, and could induce ferroptosis in full medium, whereas PEBCA particles only induced ferroptosis under cystine starvation conditions. In HepG2 cells it was recently shown that a combination of GSH depletion and cystine starvation was required for ferroptosis induction, whereas one of the treatments alone was insufficient [30] .

Remarkably, PBCA particles transiently activated the two major amino acid sensing pathways [31, 32] , as revealed by activation of GCN2 and suppression of mTORC1 signaling. The particles induced dephosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate S6K after 15-30 minutes of addition and a transient phosphorylation of GCN2 after 15 minutes ( Figure 7A-C) . mTORC1 and GCN2 not only sense cellular amino acid levels, but are also the main regulators of cellular protein biosynthesis [33, 34] . Accordingly, in parallel with the PBCAinduced dephosphorylation of S6K, protein synthesis was reduced during the first hour of incubation, before gradual recovery ( Figure 7D ). As cystine is consumed both in general protein synthesis and in GSH production, a reduction in general protein synthesis would increase the cellular availability of cystine. In line with this, cycloheximide, a well-known inhibitor of protein synthesis, totally abolished the cellular stress responses induced by low concentrations of PBCA under cystine starvation, including the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, ATF4, and Nrf2, the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, and the dephosphorylation of S6K ( Figure 7E) . Thus, the transient PBCA-induced amino acid starvation response likely delays particle-induced cytotoxic, oxidative stress effects.\n\nauthor/funder. All rights reserved.

Our data may contribute to the choice of PACA monomer as drug carrier in nanomedicine and may help explain the cytotoxicity of these NPs.\n\nThe highly similar PACA particles induced surprisingly variable cellular stress responses and cytotoxicity. From our data, it seems unlikely that the three particles merely affect the cells via the same mechanism with different potency. Rather, it seems that each particle induces specific effects during the NP-cell interaction. Moreover, the net effect on cell viability of each particle seems to be determined by the balance between particle-induced pro-death and pro-survival responses. Both the POCA particles and high concentrations of PEBCA particles clearly induced ER stress, as revealed by phosphorylation of PERK, and yet the particle-induced cytotoxicity was very different. Thus, although treatment with both PEBCA and POCA particles affect ER homeostasis, the POCA particles may exert a more acute and severe effect, which renders the cells less able to activate pro-survival pathways to restore homeostasis, and as a result, apoptosis is rapidly induced. In contrast, the PBCA particles did not induce ER stress and PERK activation, but still induced rapid and potent phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and accumulation of ATF4. This activation was mediated by the ISR, as the accumulation of ATF4 was blocked by the ISR inhibitor ISRIB or simultaneous depletion of the four ISR kinases. We were unable to identify a specific kinase responsible for the PBCA-induced ATF4 accumulation, however, this may be explained by the significant redundancy among ISR kinases [35] [36] [37] . As both GCN2, HRI, and PKR have been implicated in detection of oxidative stress [19] , and the PBCA-induced ATF4-induction was abolished by both GSH and the antioxidant NAC, it is likely that PBCA-induced oxidative stress author/funder.

Activation of ATF4 via the ISR exerted a pro-survival role upon treatment with low PBCA concentrations. This may be caused by increased ATF4-mediated transcription of components involved in antioxidant responses, such as the cystine transporter SLC7A11. Furthermore, the PBCA-induced ISR could potentially contribute to cell survival by downregulation of protein synthesis via phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. Inhibition of protein synthesis would both increase the availability of cysteine for GSH production and reduce the workload for the ER protein folding machinery, thus potentially, limiting both oxidative stress and ER stress. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide prevented PBCA-induced accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and activation of the ISR and Nrf2, linking amino acid availability, most likely cystine, to initiation of stress responses. Cycloheximide also abolished the PBCA-induced amino acid starvation response, in line with data from HepG2 cells starved for cystine [30] . Cysteine availability for GSH production may also depend on the extent of amino acid liberation through protein degradation pathways, such as proteasomal degradation. Along these lines, inhibition of proteasomal degradation by bortezomib, a promising anti-cancer drug, induced cell death via limiting the levels of intracellular cystine, and thus GSH, in myeloma cells [38] . Taken together, activation of the ISR constitutes a prosurvival response at low PBCA concentrations. Notably, although the PEBCA-induced ATF4 accumulation is likely caused by the upstream PERK activation, a contribution from the other ISR kinases, for instance by detection of oxidative stress, cannot be excluded.\n\nOur data point to alterations in cellular redox capacity as a key mechanism in the PBCA and PEBCA cytotoxicity. PEBCA-treated cells were able to mount an antioxidant response, such as activation of Nrf2, to a higher degree than PBCA-treated cells. This may contribute to the lower PEBCA cytotoxicity. Nrf2 depletion rendered the cells highly sensitive to both PBCA and PEBCA, possibly by reduced transcription of SLC7A11, as depletion of SLC7A11 induced comparable cell death as double knockdown of ATF4 and Nrf2.

Moreover, a subset of triple-negative breast tumors and cell lines, including MDA-MB-231, was shown to require expression of SLC7A11 for growth [40] . In accordance with this, cysteine seemed to play an important role in PBCA/PEBCA-induced cytotoxicity.\n\nCystine starvation reduced cellular GSH levels, increased lipid peroxidation, and strongly potentiated the cytotoxicity of both PBCA and PEBCA particles. It is unlikely that PBCA cytotoxicity is solely caused by inhibition of cystine import, as cystine starvation alone was much less cytotoxic than treatment with PBCA particles. An alternative scenario is that the particles induce concomitant GSH depletion and reduced cystine availability, as shown to be required for ferroptosis induction in HepG2 cells [30] . Supporting this, the PBCA particles induced a transient amino acid starvation response, as revealed by inactivation of the mTORC1 substrate S6K and activation of GCN2.\n\nIntriguingly, when the redox capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells was reduced either by cystine starvation or by depletion of Nrf2 or SLC7A11, treatment with PBCA or PEBCA did not induce apoptosis, but rather activated the redox-mediated, iron-dependent cell death mechanism known as ferroptosis. The PBCA particles were able to induce ferroptosis also in cells grown in full medium. These findings are of great interest in drug-delivery, as cellular stress pathways that are induced as a response to the nanocarrier itself may be beneficial if these stress responses sensitizes the target cells. Many cancer types have been shown to be sensitive to ferroptosis induction [41, 42] . Ferroptosis-sensitive cells are characterized by low antioxidant gene expression, including Nrf2 target genes, and decreased levels of GSH and NADPH [15] , are highly vulnerable to GSH depletion, and depend on constant cystine import via the Xc-transporter [13] . It was recently demonstrated that inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4, which is responsible for reduction of peroxidated lipids, leads to ferroptotic cell death of drug-tolerant cancer stem cells in a wide range of cancers [15] .

Ferroptosis-inducing drugs have been shown to cooperate with chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin [43] , doxorubicin [44] , and gemcitabine [45] . Interestingly, PEBCA particles loaded with doxorubicin are currently in clinical trials for hepatocellular carcinoma (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01655693), and since PACA particles accumulate in the liver [46] , they may influence the redox status of the tumor cells and contribute to cell killing by ferroptosis. Our data also suggests that exchanging the PEBCA monomer with PBCA could potentially prove even more efficient in cell killing of drug-resistant cancers. Moreover, induction of a necrotic tumor cell death such as ferroptosis could potentially contribute to higher tumor infiltration of immune cells, further contributing to tumor clearance [47] . Thus, identification of ferroptosis-inducing NPs is of considerable interest. Certain iron oxide-based NPs have been suggested to contribute to ferroptosis-induction via the Fenton reaction, i.e.\n\niron-catalyzed ROS production [48] . It was recently demonstrated that even small silica-based NPs that are not composed of iron, could induce ferroptosis under amino acid starvation conditions [49] . Based on our findings, it is tempting to speculate that this was due to starvation for cystine specifically, although this was not addressed.\n\nHow do NPs induce cellular stress responses, and why do the PACAs studied here have different effects? It has been proposed that physical interactions between NPs and the plasma membrane may signal membrane stress to the cell interior [50] . The interaction between NPs and cellular membranes may lead to alterations in membrane fluidity, the composition of micro-domains, or membrane curvature [51] . Such membrane alterations are known to affect the activity of membrane proteins like receptors, enzymes, ion channels, and nutrient transporters [50] . There are no gross differences in physical characteristics of the three PACA particles. They are of similar size, shape and surface charge. However, their alkyl side chains have increasing hydrophobicity in the order PBCA < PEBCA < POCA. Although author/funder. All rights reserved.

It was recently shown that the hydrophilicity of the NP polymer shell dictated the composition of the protein corona generated in blood [53] .\n\nAlthough the total amount of adhered protein was equal, the protein pattern was different.\n\nThis determined the NP-cell interactions and the nanocarrier's stealth properties. Not only proteins, but also lipoproteins have been shown to strongly adhere to NPs [54] .Thus, the different cellular effects of PACA particles may be caused by the specific corona surrounding each particle type.\n\nAlthough the degradation of PACA NPs has been shown to be slow in vitro [18] , the differential NP cytotoxicity may be caused by release of particle-specific degradation products. Degradation of PACA particles releases cyanoacrylic acid and the corresponding alkyl alcohol, i.e. ethyl-butyl alcohol, butanol, or octanol [55]. It has been indicated that the alkyl chain length dictates the PACA particle degradation rate [18, 55] . POCA particles were shown to have the slowest in vitro degradation rate, yet they exert the highest cytotoxicity ( [11] and data from this study). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that either the degradation rate is faster when the particles are in contact with the cellular surface than in the absence of cells, and/or the liberated degradation products of the three particle types exert highly different cellular cytotoxicities. In line with this, the hydrophobicity of the released alkyl alcohols is different. The highly hydrophobic octanol will most likely insert into the lipid bilayer and affect membrane properties to a much higher extent than the hydrophilic butanol.\n\nIn support of this, in neural crests octanol induced intracellular calcium release and apoptosis at micromolar concentrations, whereas millimolar concentrations of butanol were required [56] . Thus, although POCAs may be degraded more slowly, the liberated alcohol is significantly more potent, which may explain the high POCA cytotoxicity. Moreover, as author/funder. All rights reserved.

Moreover, cystine availability was identified as a key determinant of PBCA/PEBCA cytotoxicity. Importantly, PBCA particles were identified as inducers of ferroptosis, which may be exploited in drug-delivery settings.\n\nTogether this demonstrates the importance of careful examination of the interaction between NPs and human cells for optimal exploitation of NPs in biomedicine, and to predict nanotoxicity. author/funder.
