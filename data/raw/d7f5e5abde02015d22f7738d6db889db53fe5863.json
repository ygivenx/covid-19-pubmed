{"title": "\"Nature Hath Fram'd Strange Fellows in Her Time\" \u23afWilliam Shakespeare, The Merchant of Venice", "body": "Venice, la Serenissima or Most Serene Republic, and the myths surrounding her mercantile empire lent themselves to the theatrical, apotheotic exuberance of Veronese's style. The city, described by Petrarch in 1364 as \"rich in gold but richer in renown,\" mythologized herself-Venetia, Queen of the Andriatic, at once pagan and medieval, her heritage not so much of classical Rome but the Byzantine East (5) . He painted her effortless grandeur in gowns of gold brocade, seated on clouds, trumpeted by angels, showered with jewels from the gods.\n\nVenice inspired generations of poets and writers from William Shakespeare and Lord Byron to Thomas Mann. And Veronese infl uenced the course of European art-in the 17th century through Rubens and Velazquez, in the 18th, through Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and others.\n\nJuno, the Roman goddess bestowing gifts on Venice in Veronese's brilliant allegory on this month's cover, was none other than Greek goddess Hera, powerful wife of Zeus. In antiquity, her giving was legend, for havoc as well as gifts. She ruined foes but sanctioned marriage, her generosity even celebrated by Shakespeare, \"Honour, riches, marriage-blessing, / Long continuance, and increasing, / Hourly joys be still upon you! / Juno sings her blessings on you\" (6) . In this, another of her less bellicose appearances, Juno rains gold and crowns on Venice, grooming her for greatness and prosperity. Afl oat in sensuous color, she glances down at her. An olive branch, signifying honor, acknowledges a city \"mighty in her resources but mightier in virtue\" (7) .\n\nThe extravagance of Juno's gesture and its gracious acceptance bespeak the mythic greatness and splendor of Venice. Poetry and utopian texts, as well as the art of Veronese's time, attributed this greatness in part to topography-though lapped by the waves, Venice maintained close ties with the northern mainland and amassed a land empire, the terraferma (dry land). Another link to greatness was harmonious interaction with nature and the cosmos. Venetian humanist Pietro Bembo proposed \"ideal love\" as key to this interaction. Likewise, Jacopo Sannazzaro in L'Arcadia (1500) attributed moral and spiritual perfection to human connection with the natural world and its rhythms (7) .\n\nLa Serenissima succumbed in the late 1700s, becoming a ville cr\u00e9pusculaire (city like any other). Like the original Arcadia, she had existed largely in the imagination. Connection with nature, indispensable to the myth, survived the fall of the empire; poets, painters, and scientists still seek it in Venice and elsewhere.\n\nBejeweled crowns from above, royal coronas, seem far removed from nature. Yet, nature disperses her own, less conspicuously but with far more bountiful abundance than Juno. Coronaviruses, common viruses of animals and humans, are named for their crownlike appearance. Recently, they came under the spotlight, when an obscure animal coronavirus left its wildlife reservoir to cause SARS, a lethal disease in humans. Nature's gift that keeps on giving, these viruses continue to emerge, in more species, more places, and now perhaps in North American bats, which could become involved in future emergence in humans or other animals (8) ."}
