Tr1 cells can be differentiated from na\u00efve CD4 + T cells upon TCR engagement in the 69 presence of IL-27 in vitro [28] , and in order to identify and obtain viable Tr1 cells for clinical 70 application, co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b has been recently proposed to be cell surface 71 signature of the Foxp3 -IL-10 high Tr1 cells [15] .

LAG3 is highly expressed by IL-10 + CD4 + T 73 cells [31] , as well as by activated effector T cells [32] and Foxp3 + Treg cells [33] . CD49b is the \uf0612 74 integrin subunit, highly expressed by NK cells [34] . CD49b is up-regulated in T cells that may 75 produce IL-10 and/or pro-inflammatory cytokines [35; 36; 37] . In addition to Foxp3 -Tr1 cells, IL-76 10 can be highly up-regulated in activated Foxp3 + Treg and CD8 + T cells under inflammatory 77 conditions and/or upon TCR activation. Given the importance of being able to identify Foxp3 -Tr1 78 cells, including under clinical conditions, and to gain a better understanding of the specificity of 79 co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b as a cell surface signature for IL-10-producing cells, we 80 sought to determine whether co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b can mark broader range of T 81 cell subsets that are actively producing high levels of IL-10. 82 Using a murine model carrying an IL-10 GFP /Foxp3 RFP dual reporter system, we find that 83 co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b is a generic feature of the IL-10-producing Foxp3 -CD4 + , 84\n\nFoxp3 + CD4 + and CD8 + T cell subsets. The capacity of co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b 85 expression in marking IL-10 high T cell subsets is dependent on the disease conditions and 86 anatomical locations of the cells. Furthermore, co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b expression is 87 also a shared feature of human IL-10-producing FOXP3 -CD4 + , FOXP3 + CD4 + and CD8 + T cell 88 subsets. Our data reveal that co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b is a generic signature of IL-10-89 producing T cells, which is broader than previously appreciated. 90 91 .

We and others have previously reported that both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (Fig. 1A) . Surprisingly, the resultant IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells 197\n\ninduced in vitro through this protocol also exhibited high levels of LAG3/CD49b co-expression 198 ( Fig. 1A , last plot). In fact, IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells can express higher levels of LAG3 and 199\n\nCD49b than their IL-10-producing CD4 + counterparts induced in the same cell culture (Fig. 1B) . determine whether co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b is exclusive to Foxp3 -Tr1 cell subset, we 210 infected IL-10 GFP /Foxp3 RFP dual reporter mice with Nb, and analyzed the IL-10-producing T cells. 211\n\nWe found that, as previously described, a large majority of the IL-10-producing T cells in the lungs 212\n\nof Nb-infected mice express high levels of both LAG3 and CD49b (Fig. 2A&B) , and are 213 .

However interestingly, these IL-10-producing 214 LAG3 + CD49b + CD4 + T cells included both Foxp3 + and Foxp3 -CD4 + T cells subsets (Fig. 2C , last 215 plot; and Fig. 2D ). To further determine whether LAG3/CD49b co-expression is correlated with 216 IL-10 and/or Foxp3 expression in CD4 + T cells, we compared the percentage of LAG3/CD49b 217 double positive population in Foxp3 -IL-10 -, Foxp3 -IL-10 + , Foxp3 + IL-10and Foxp3 + IL-10 + CD4 + T 218 cells isolated from the lungs of Nb-infected mice. We found that regardless of expression of Foxp3, 219\n\nNb infection did not lead to significant up-regulation of LAG3/CD49b co-expression on IL-10 -CD4 + 220 T cells (Fig. 2E&F) . However, the percentage of the LAG3 + CD49b + population of IL-10 + CD4 + T 221 cells is significantly higher than their IL-10counterparts ( Fig. 2F) . Moreover, the levels of LAG3 222 and CD49b expression are similar between the Foxp3 + and Foxp3counterparts of IL-10 + CD4 + T 223 cells (Fig. 2G) . Therefore, IL-10-producing CD4 + T cells, regardless of Foxp3 expression, have a 224 high capacity of co-expressing LAG3 and CD49b. Together with the data shown in Fig. 1 , these 225 data suggest that co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b is a generic feature of IL-10-producing T 226 cells, including Foxp3 -Tr1 cells, Foxp3 + Treg cells and CD8 + T cells. 227\n\nThe composition of LAG3 + CD49b + IL-10-producing T cells differs in different disease models 229 IL-10 plays an essential role in pulmonary inflammatory diseases, reported in multiple 230 murine models of lung diseases, including allergic asthma [46], hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) 231\n\n[47] and influenza pneumonia [20] . We examined whether the expression of LAG3 and CD49b 232 would differ based on the inflammatory response in three mouse models of lung inflammation. 233\n\nMice carrying the IL-10 GFP /Foxp3 RFP dual reporters were exposed intranasally to house dust mite 234 (HDM) protein extract (as a model of allergic asthma), Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula (SR) (as a 235 model of HP/farmers' lung disease), or infected intranasally with WSN/flu virus (as a model of 236 influenza infection). We observed significant percentages of IL-10-producing T cells in the lung 237 tissue of mice exposed HDM (Fig. 3A) , SR (Fig. 3C) , or WSN/flu virus (Fig. 3E) . These IL-10-238 producing T cells all co-expressed high levels of LAG3 and CD49b, and include Foxp3 + CD4 + , 239 .

However, the relative 240\n\nproportions of IL-10-producing Foxp3 + CD4 + , Foxp3 -CD4and CD8 + subsets differed in the 241 various disease models (Fig. 3) . In contrast to composition of IL-10-producing LAG3 + CD49b + T 242 cells induced by Nb infection, in which Foxp3 -CD4 + subset is the majority (72% in Fig. 2B) , in 243 HDM-induced allergic asthma model, the largest subset of the IL-10-producing LAG3 + CD49b + T 244 cells in lungs are Foxp3 + CD4 + T cells (60%), followed by Foxp3 -CD4 + T cells (32%), while CD8 + 245 T cells are only around 1.4% (Fig. 3B) . In the SR-triggered farmer's lung disease model, Foxp3 + 246 CD4 + T cells are the largest majority of the IL-10-producing LAG3 + CD49b + T cell subset in the 247 lungs, however, there are similar percentages of Foxp3 -CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (16% each) (Fig.  248   3D) . Strikingly in the murine model of influenza infection, CD8 + T cells are the largest subset of 249 the IL-10-producing LAG3 + CD49b + T cells in the lungs (86%), followed by Foxp3 -CD4 + T cells, 250\n\nwhile Foxp3 + CD4 + are a minority (Fig. 3F) . These data compared the composition of IL-10-251 producing LAG3 + CD49b + T cells in various murine models of pulmonary inflammatory diseases. The composition of LAG3 + CD49b + IL-10-producing T cells differs in different organs 258\n\nAs discussed above, we demonstrated that co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b is a 259 generic feature of IL-10-producing T cells in vivo in the pulmonary tissues under multiple 260 inflammatory conditions (Figs. 2-3) . To determine whether this feature is applicable to IL-10-261 producing cells in other organs, we injected IL-10 GFP /Foxp3 RFP dual reporter mice with an anti-262 CD3\uf065 antibody that has been shown to stimulate pronounced IL-10 production by T cells through The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

An interesting note is that 267 the relative abundance of Foxp3 + CD4 + , Foxp3 -CD4 + and CD8 + subsets among the IL-10-268 producing LAG3 + CD49b + T cells vary significantly in different organs of the same mice (Fig. 4B) . 269\n\nUpon TCR activation in vivo, Foxp3 + CD4 + T cells are the major population that are IL-270 10 + LAG3 + CD49b + in the blood, lymph nodes and lungs, while CD8 + T cells are the majority of IL-271 10 + LAG3 + CD49b + T cells in the perigonadal fat and small intestine (Fig. 4B) . These data suggest 272 that co-expression of LAG3/CD49b marks all three IL-10-producing T cell subsets in multiple 273 organs and the relative abundance of the Foxp3 + CD4 + , Foxp3 -CD4 + and CD8 + T cell subsets in 274 IL-10-producing LAG3 + CD49b + T cells is dependent on the anatomical location of the cells. 275\n\nHuman IL-10-producing CD4 + and CD8 + T cells exhibit LAG3 + CD49b + phenotype 277\n\nIn murine models, we demonstrated that co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b marks IL-10-278 producing Foxp3 + CD4 + , Foxp3 -CD4 + and CD8 + T cells under different inflammatory conditions 279 in the lungs (Fig. 2-3) , as well as in different organs when TCR is activated in vivo (Fig. 4) . To 280 further determine whether different subsets of IL-10-producing T cells exhibit the shared feature 281 of co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b in human, we isolated CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from human 282 peripheral blood and cultured them under IL-10-inducing conditions. We found that as in the 283 mouse, human IL-10-producing FOXP3 + CD4 + , FOXP3 + CD4 + and CD8 + subsets all up-regulated 284 both LAG3 and CD49b expression, with a significant LAG3/CD49b double positive population 285 (Fig. 5) .

In addition, we find that the IL-10-producing LAG3 + CD49b + T cell 291 population is composed of Foxp3 + CD4 + , Foxp3 -CD4 + , and CD8 + T cell subsets, and this 292 composition varies depending on disease conditions and anatomical locations of the cells. The 293 significance of this work is emphasized due to the importance of identifying Foxp3 -Tr1 cells, 294\n\nincluding under clinical conditions, and our findings urge caution in the use of LAG3 and CD49b 295 to uniquely identify these cells. 296\n\nUsing Tr1 cell clones derived from human na\u00efve CD4 + T cells and purified by an IL-10 297 secretion assay, Gagliani, Roncarolo and colleagues identified co-expression of LAG3, CD49b 298 and CD226 as cell surface signatures of IL-10-producing CD4 + T cells, and demonstrated that co-299 expression of LAG3 and CD49b is sufficient to distinguish Foxp3 -IL-10 high Tr1 cells from T helper 300 and/or regulatory subsets that expressed lower levels of or no IL-10 in both mouse and human 301\n\n[15]. However, it was recently reported that IL-10-producing T cells derived from human CD4 + 302 memory T cells exhibit low levels of surface expression of LAG3 and CD49b [48], suggesting that 303 the pattern of co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b may vary in human IL-10-producing CD4 + T 304 cells, which may be associated with whether they were derived from na\u00efve precursors versus 305 memory cells. Indeed, co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b may not be able to mark all IL-10-306 producing Tr1-like cells, but may serve to help eliminate those T cells lineages that are not 307 capable of producing IL-10 for potential clinical interest. Whether co-expression of LAG3 and 308\n\nCD49b would allow efficient recovery of IL-10 high T cells may dependent on the proportion of IL-309 10 high T cells that are co-expressing LAG3 and CD49b, which may differ dependent on whether 310 the relevant IL-10-producing cells had different origins and/or underwent different activation 311 regimes. 312 .

Co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b is more restricted to IL-10-producing subsets, as 315 previously described in Foxp3 -CD4 + T cells [15] . And our data here demonstrated that this is a 316 generic feature of IL-10-producing cells, including Foxp3 -CD4 + , Foxp3 + CD4 + and CD8 + subsets. 317\n\nThe co-occurrence of IL-10 production and LAG3 + CD49b + may be explained in two ways. The CD49b downstream pathways, leading to up-regulation of IL-10. Given the complexity of these 341 pathways, comprehensive understanding of the mechanism(s) underlying the co-expression of 342 these markers with IL-10 will require significantly more in-depth analyses. Regardless of the 343 mechanism, our findings indicate that LAG3/CD49b co-expression does not uniquely identify 344 Foxp3 -Tr1 cells, but is a more general indicator of IL-10 production in T cell lineages. 345\n\nDespite the shared feature of co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b by IL-10-producing 346 we observed an increased proportion of IL-10 + LAG3 + CD49b + T cells that are CD8 + , which is the 355 predominant population in the Flu model (Fig. 3F) . This discrepancy in the composition of IL-10-356 producing LAG3 + CD49b + T cells may be due to the difference of the microenvironment in which in IL-10-producing CD8 + T cells either [65] , suggesting that AhR signaling has multifaceted 373 function in regulating the level of IL-10 expression in different T cell lineages. A more 374 comprehensive understanding of the T cell-intrinsic molecular features that are shared or distinct 375 among the IL-10-producing CD8 + , Foxp3 -CD4 + and Foxp3 + CD4 + T cells awaits further 376\n\nOur data reported here demonstrate that co-expression of LAG3 and CD49b marks IL-378 10 high T cell subsets that are Foxp3 + CD4 + , Foxp3 -CD4 + or CD8 + in both human and mouse, and \n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or 404 financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. 405 406 .
