{"title": "Structure of Main Protease from Human Coronavirus NL63: Insights for Wide Spectrum Anti-Coronavirus Drug Design", "body": "There are two protein molecules in an asymmetric unit. The two molecules form a typical homodimer (Fig. 1a), which has been observed in the crystal structures of other CoV Mpros485253. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of Mpro homodimer in solution which is also the only active form of the enzyme56575859, supporting the physiological relevance of structural findings. A structural comparison of protomer A in Mpro-N3 complex with that in apo enzyme (PDB ID: 3TLO; C. P. Chuck & K. B. Wong, unpublished work) revealed an overall architecture of three domains (Fig. 1b) in each protomer, a common feature among CoV Mpro structures. Domain I (residues 8\u2013100) and domain II (residues 101\u2013183) together form a chymotrypsin-like fold, and the substrate-binding site is located in a cleft formed between domain I and domain II. The catalytic dyad composed of Cys144 and His41 lies in the center of substrate-binding site. Domain III (residues 200\u2013303) of HCoV-NL63 Mpro is composed of a globular antiparallel \u03b1-helical cluster, a unique feature of CoV Mpro that is required for homodimer formation. Domain III is connected to domain II through a long loop region of 16 residues. X-ray data-processing and refinement statistics are included in Table 1.\n\nMichael acceptor inhibitors such as N3 (Fig. 2a) undergoes mechanism-based inhibition to achieve covalent irreversible inactivation, as shown in the equation (1):\n\n\n\nThe inhibitor first forms a reversible complex (EI) with the enzyme under the equilibrium-binding constant Ki. It then undergoes nucleophilic attack by the active site Cys of the enzyme, leading to the formation of a stable covalent bond (E-I). This step is governed by the inactivation rate constant, k3. Using a CoV consensus substrate reported previously484953, we first determined the values for Km and kcat of the apo enzyme of HCoV-NL63 Mpro, as 50.8 \u00b1 3.4 \u03bcM and 0.098 \u00b1 0.004 s\u22121, respectively (Table 2). Cross comparison with Mpros from other human CoVs revealed that the kinetic parameters of HCoV-NL63 Mpro is relatively close to those for SARS-CoV (Km = 129 \u00b1 7 \u03bcM, kcat = 0.14 \u00b1 0.01 s\u22121)49. Rather Km of HCoV-NL63 is higher than that for HCoV-229E, while its kcat is approximately ten fold larger than those for HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1. We then added inhibitor N3 to the kinetic assay of HCoV-NL63 Mpro, and calculated the Ki and k3 as 11.3 \u00b1 1.0 \u03bcM and 42.4 \u00b1 5.0 (10\u22123\u2219s\u22121), respectively (Table 2). Although the ki for HCoV-NL63 is higher compared with those for SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E, indicating a lower affinity of inhibitor N3 to the apo enzyme, its k3 is significantly larger, which strongly supports the ability of N3 to achieve mechanism-based irreversible inhibition against HCoV-NL63 Mpro.\n\nAnalysis of the complex structure of HCoV-NL63 Mpro bound to inhibitor N3 provides further insight into the inhibition mechanism (Fig. 2b). Since N3 binds to Protomer A and B similarly, we will only look into the binding mode of N3 in Protomer A below. C\u03b2 of vinyl group on inhibitor N3 forms a standard 1.8 \u00c5 covalent bond with the S\u03b3 atom of Cys144, as evidenced by clear electron density (Fig. 2b). This indicates that a Michael addition reaction occurred between N3 and the catalytic site Cys144. Compared with the apo enzyme, only one specific conformation is observed due to the formation of covalent bond while there exists a double conformation for S\u03b3 in the apo enzyme. The carbonyl oxygen of ester on N3 is very close to the backbone NH of Gly142 and the backbone of NH of Cys144 (Fig. 2c), which mimics the tetrahedral oxyanion intermediate state formed during serine protease cleavage and provides additional support to anchor the Michael acceptor. The benzyl ester part of N3 further extends into the S1\u2019 pocket, forming Van der Waals interaction with Val26 and Leu27 (Fig. 2b).\n\nComparison between the molecular surfaces of HCoV-NL63 Mpro complexed with N3 and the apo enzyme reveals that the pocket accommodating N3 undergoes significant conformation changes upon inhibitor binding (Fig. 3a,b) as following: (1) the imidazole group of His41 swifts ~5 \u00c5 towards the hydrophobic core of the protein to better accommodate P1\u2019 site; (2) the main chain of residues 138\u2013142 which constitute the outer wall of S1 subsite moves toward the lactam ring, causing the shrinking of S1 pocket; (3) residues 45\u201351 flip over to act as a lid to cover P2 subsite; (4) residues 164\u2013168 and 187\u2013191 extend into opposite directions to host N3. In the following sections, we will describe the detailed structural features of the subpockets.\n\nCoronaviral Mpros are known to have strong preference to glutamine (Q) at P1 site of substrate. Genome sequence analysis of HCoV-NL63 revealed that 10 out of 11 Mpro cleavage sites bear glutamine at P1 position, except that the recognition site between nsp13 (helicase) and nsp14 (exonuclease) where histidine replaces glutamine at P1 site37. This feature is unique only in genomes of HCoV-NL63 (NC_005831) and HCoV-HKU1 (NC_006577). In contrast, glutamine is the exclusive residue in P1 among all cleavage sites for the other four human CoVs, including HCoV-229E (NC_002645), HCoV-OC43 (NC_005147), SARS-CoV (NC_004718), and MERS-CoV (JX869059). Such novel substrate specificity at P1 in HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 implies unique structural feature of S1 subpocket. The crystal structure of HCoV-NL63 Mpro shows that the size of its S1 pocket is comparable to that of HCoV-HKU1, but smaller than those of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV. Clearly, a smaller S1 pocket in HCoV-NL63 could better accommodate the smaller side chain of histidine residue at P1 of nsp13-nsp14, and facilitate cleavage when weakened oxyanion hole is formed.\n\nIn our enzyme-inhibitor complex structure, the lactam ring of N3 molecule serves as a structural analog to glutamine or histidine at P1 position (Fig. 2a), and protrudes into the S1 pocket by forming a 2.5 \u00c5 hydrogen bond between the lactam oxygen and the imidazole ring NH of His163 (Fig. 2b,c), which is similar to those in the complex structures of SARS-CoV Mpro and HCoV-HKU1 Mpro with inhibitor N34953. Furthermore, the NH of N3 lactam ring forms two hydrogen bonds with O\u03b51 of Glu166 (3.1 \u00c5) and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Phe139 (3.2 \u00c5) respectively, which provide additional support to stabilize the lactam ring in S1 pocket. The backbone NH of P1 residue on N3 also forms a 3.0 \u00c5 hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen from Gln164, favorably accommodating the S1 pocket.\n\nThe P2 position of natural Mpro cleavage sites across of the genomes of six human CoVs usually prefers a hydrophobic residue (Table 3). It is surprising that the P2 residues are completely identical among all 11 cleavage sites between the two alphacoronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E. In a majority of cases, it is leucine residue occupying the P2 position, with valine at nsp6-nsp7 and isoleucine at nsp10-nsp11. On the other hand, more variations are observed in the P2 position among betacoronaviruses, with more alternative residues such as methionine, phenylalanine, and proline, which might indicate less stringency of P2 specificity. The P2 site of inhibitor N3 mimics the side chain of leucine, in order to cover the maximum spectrum of natural Mpro substrates for human CoVs49. As observed in the HCoV-NL63 structure with N3, the aliphatic isobutyl side chain of P2 protrudes into the deep S2 pocket via interactions with the alkyl portion of the side chains of Asp187, Pro189, and is well accommodated onto the Van der Waals surface of the pocket (Fig. 2b).\n\nTo determine the structural diversity in S2 pocket, we then superimposed the backbones of four know Mpro structures from human CoVs. The lid of the S2 pocket in HCoV-NL63 is covered by a tight loop of residues 45\u201351 (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the same region in SARS-CoV and HCoV-HKU1 adopts a secondary structure of 310 helix to maintain S2 pocket53. Such difference might partially account for the increased variation of natural P2 residues as observed in the genomes of betacoronaviruses.\n\nThe P3 side chains of N3 inhibitor are both solvent exposed in the two protomers of HCoV-NL63 Mpro (Figs 2b and 3b). This is consistent with the fact that no specificity for any particular side chains exists at the P3 position of cleavage sites among CoV Mpros55. Further, the NH and carbonyl oxygen of P3 backbone form two hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl oxygen and NH of Glu166 respectively, which help anchor the N3 inhibitor to the HCoV-NL63 Mpro at P3 location.\n\nThe P4 position of the inhibitor N3 is alanine, and its side chain readily inserts into the relatively shallow P4 pocket (Fig. 3b), forming hydrophobic interactions with Pro189. Also the backbone NH of alanine residue on N3 donates a 2.9-\u00c5 hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen of Ser190 (Fig. 2c). The isoxazole at P5 makes Van der Waals interactions with Gly168 and the backbone of residues Leu191 (Fig. 2b). Overall, the pattern of interactions between N3 and HCoV-NL63 Mpro at P3, P4, and P5 positions is similar to that between N3 and SARS-CoV Mpro 49.\n\nSo far, whole genomic sequences of as many as 30 strains of HCoV-NL63 have been deposited into NCBI database1644456061. These strains were isolated from patient specimens dated back to the past three decades from several countries, including The Netherlands, United States, and China. High percentage of sequence variation among these clinically isolated HCoV-NL63 strains and evidence of in vivo recombination during co-infections with other CoVs have been documented, especially in the N-terminal domain of spike protein and nsp2/nsp3 region4460. In order to determine the efficacy of inhibitor N3 against sequence variation accumulated during the circulation of HCoV-NL63 in human population, we assessed the level of sequence and structural conservation in the molecular target of this inhibitor among different clinical isolates. Sequence for Mpro (nsp5) was retrieved from these HCoV-NL63 strains with available genomic sequences (Supplementary Table S1), and alignment was performed to determine sequence variations among these clinical isolates. Mpro sequence from strain Amsterdam I (NC_005831) was used as reference1644. Overall, Mpro is extremely conserved among clinical HCoV-NL63 strains isolated worldwide (Supplementary Fig. S1), evidencing the enzyme\u2019s essential role in viral replication. Sequence variation is only observed in 3 residues: His69 is mutated to Tyr in 13 strains isolated from United States, Cys221 is mutated to Arg among all the strains that have not been cultured in vitro, and Met235 is mutated to Ile in only one strain isolated in United States (Fig. 5a). When plotted onto the structure of HCoV-NL63 Mpro, these 3 residues are all located in flexible regions, such as loop and molecular surface (Fig. 5b). None of the 3 residues are directly interacting with inhibitor N3, which provides clear structural evidence to support the effectiveness of N3 against all the clinical strains of HCoV-NL63, in spite of significant genomic sequence variation and potential for recombination in viral transmission.\n\nThe substrate-binding site of Mpro has been shown as a conserved drug target for designing wide spectrum anti-CoV inhibitors48495153. Given the evidence of repetitive global epidemics (such as SARS and MERS) caused by zoonotic transmission11192021222324, it is imperative to examine whether the substrate-binding site and the inhibition mechanism employed by inhibitor N3 are conserved between known human CoVs and their related zoonotic CoVs. We chose three most representative pairs of human CoVs and their zoonotic counterparts: HCoV-229E (NC_002645) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV, NC_003045), SARS-CoV (NC_004718) and SARS-related CoV isolated from bat (BtSARSr-CoV, KC881006), MERS-CoV (JX869059) and dromedary camel MERS-CoV (DcMERS-CoV, KJ713296). We then retrieved their Mpro sequences from NCBI database. The direct bat ancestor of HCoV-NL63 has not been identified47, therefore we only use HCoV-NL63 Mpro sequence and its secondary structure presented in this study as reference. Sequence alignment, shown in Fig. 6a, demonstrates significant homology in primary amino acid sequence among these 7 CoVs.\n\nA closer examination at the substrate-binding pocket further reveals a conservative 3D architecture at this drug target (Fig. 6b). Those residues, which are critical for pocket formation, such as Leu27, Gly142 for pocket S1\u2019; Phe139, His163, Glu166, His172 for pocket S1; His41, Tyr53, Asp187 for pocket S2; Leu167, Gln192 for pocket S4, are strictly conserved among various CoVs (Fig. 6a,b). Peptidomimetic inhibitor N3, through its Michael acceptor and well-designed side chains, snugly fits into the conserved substrate-binding pocket. The binding of N3 establishes a concerted interaction network, including a 1.8-\u00c5 covalent bond between C\u03b2 of vinyl group on inhibitor N3 and the S\u03b3 atom of Cys144, 7 hydrogen bonds and extensive hydrophobic interactions between N3 and the above residues critical for interplay. These findings demonstrate that inhibitor N3 could exert inhibitory effect towards a conserved site in CoVs both before and after zoonotic transmission. Therefore, in addition to its role in inhibiting known circulating human CoV species, inhibitor N3 might also serve as a lead compound for preclinical and clinical testing against potential future epidemic caused by CoV emerging from zoonotic origin.\n\nThe world has experienced two global outbreaks of CoV infections since entering the 21st century56789111213. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause severe respiratory syndrome with high mortality rate101415. In addition, four more human CoVs, namely HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-OC43, have been identified as pathological agents for common cold91617. The lack of effective therapeutic and preventive strategies against human CoVs calls for immediate action of the scientific community950. We previously demonstrated that designing wide spectrum inhibitor at a conservative target is a viable method to develop anti-CoV therapeutics, given the high mutation and recombination rates observed in viral replication48495153. The ability of CoV to cross animal-human boundary provides further support to our strategy. Indeed, several human CoVs, including HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, have been linked to zoonotic CoVs which naturally infect hosts such as bats or dromedary camels20212223242546. In current study, we use the Mpro from HCoV-NL63 as our model molecule, and present its crystal structure in complex with an inhibitor. Based on the structural detail at 2.85 \u00c5 resolution, the substrate-binding pocket of HCoV-NL63 Mpro is conserved among three pairs of human and zoonotic CoVs (Fig. 6). Several key residues at the subsites for substrate binding are completely identical among these seven coronaviruses, for example Phe139, His163, Glu166, His172 of S1; His41, Tyr53, Asp187 of S2; and Leu167, Gln192 of S4. These findings are consistent with the role of Mpro in viral replication, which is essential to the proteolytic processing and maturation of replicase polyprotein (encoded by ORF1). Analysis of substrate recognition sequence, based on available whole genome sequences of all six human CoVs, provides additional evidence to the conservation of Mpro substrate-binding pocket: the P1 position requires almost exclusively glutamine, and the P2 position exhibits strong preference for hydrophobic residues such as Leu and Val (Table 3). Taken together, through designing of wide spectrum inhibitors at a conservative site on Mpro, our study outlines a novel therapeutic approach of containing diseases caused by both existing and possible future emerging human CoVs.\n\nA close examination of the interaction between HCoV-NL63 Mpro and inhibitor N3 reveals structural details of inhibition mechanism. N3 is a synthetic peptidomimetic compound with Michael acceptor (Fig. 2a), which achieves mechanism-based enzyme inactivation through forming an irreversible covalent bond with Cys144 of catalytic dyad (Fig. 2b,c). The success of two serine protease inhibitors, telaprevir and boceprevir, in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) has underscored the importance of covalent inhibitors for targeting viral proteases62. Both telaprevir and boceprevir are peptidomimetic inhibitors carry a warhead of \u03b1-ketoamide, which forms a covalent yet reversible bond with catalytic triad serine residue of HCV NS3\u22194 A protease6263. Michael acceptor has also been used as a warhead in pharmaceutical targeting against viral protease, for example rupintrivir was developed as an inhibitor for 3C protease of human rhinovirus and enterovirus506465. The backbone of N3 forms 7 hydrogen bonds with residues in the substrate-binding pocket (Fig. 2c). The pockets accommodating N3 undergo gate-regulated switch to facilitate the binding of inhibitor N3 (Fig. 3), an interesting phenomena initially observed in case of Mpro from SARS-CoV49.\n\nIn addition, the structure of HCoV-NL63 Mpro exhibits several unique but interesting features. Examination of its natural cleavage sites based on HCoV-NL63 genomic sequence reveals an unusual histidine P1 residue between nsp13 and nsp14, which is unique to HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 among all human CoVs37. Such P1 anomaly is partially accommodated by the relatively smaller S1 pocket, as the size of its S1 pocket is comparable to that of HCoV-HKU1, but smaller than those of HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV. The P2 position seems to present genus specificity among alphacoronaviruses, as the P2 residues among all 11 natural cleavage sites are completely identical between HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E with a strong dominance of leucine. While large variation on P2 residue is observed in the genomes of human betacoronaviruses.\n\nIn summary, the crystal structure of HCoV-NL63 Mpro complexed with inhibitor N3 has provided critical insight into the design of irreversible inhibitor carrying a Michael acceptor warhead. Through detailed sequence and structural comparison, this compound demonstrates feasibility as potential broad spectrum therapeutic agent for both existing and possibly emerging human CoVs. Further pharmaceutical development of such covalent peptidomimetic inhibitors would yield success in clinical management of human coronavirus diseases and public health preparedness for possible future pandemic.\n\nProtein expression and purification of HCoV-NL63 main protease has been described previously66. The coding sequence was subcloned into pGEX-6P-1 vector, and transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells. Cell culture was first grown in LB medium containing 100 \u03bcg ml\u22121 ampicillin at 37 \u00b0C until optical density (OD600) reached 0.6. Protein expression was then induced by adding isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and further cultured at 16 \u00b0C for 16 hours. Cell pellets were harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline solution supplemented with 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 10% glycerol. Cell lysate was prepared using sonication and centrifugation (12,000 g, 50 min, 4 \u00b0C). GST-tagged HCoV-NL63 Mpro fusion protein was bound to glutathione sepharose 4B affinity resin, and GST tag was removed through on-column cleavage using commercial PreScission protease (GE Healthcare) at 4 \u00b0C for 18 hours. Recombinant HCoV-NL63 Mpro protein was subject to an additional step of anion-exchange chromatography using HiTrap Q column (GE Healthcare), and was eluted with a linear gradient of 25 to 250 mM NaCl (20 mM Tris-HCl pH = 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT).\n\nPurified protein was supplemented with 10% DMSO and concentrated to 1 mg ml\u22121. Crystals of HCoV-NL63 Mpro in complex with inhibitor N3 were produced by cocrystallization. Inhibitor N3 was added to HCoV Mpro protein at a molar ratio between 3:1 and 5:1, and incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 4 hours. The complex was then centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min, and concentrated to 10 mg ml\u22121 in a buffer containing 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT. Using hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 16 \u00b0C, best crystals were obtained after 2 days using a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M HEPES pH 5.5, 10%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 4%(v/v) ethylene glycol (PDB entry 3TLO) and 0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic dehydrate pH 5.6, 1.0 M ammonium phosphate monobasic in a ratio of 80:2067.\n\nData for HCoV-NL63 Mpro-N3 complex was collected to a 2.85-\u00c5 resolution at 100 K on beamline 1W2B of Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), using a MAR165 charge-coupled device detector. The cryoprotectant solution contained 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 4% (v/v) ethylene glycol, and 0.1 M HEPES pH 5.5. All data integration and scaling were performed using HKL200068. The Matthews coefficient of the crystal suggested two molecules per asymmetric unit, and the solvent content was 59.8%.\n\nThe structure of HCoV-NL63 Mpro-N3 complex was determined using molecular replacement from that of apo-form HCoV-NL63 Mpro (PDB ID: 3TLO; C. P. Chuck & K. B. Wong, unpublished work). All cross-rotation and translation searches for molecular replacement were performed with Phaser69. Cycles of manual adjustment using Coot70 and subsequent refinement using PHENIX71 led to a final model with a crystallographic R factor (Rcryst) of 19.4% and a free R factor (Rfree) of 24.1% at 2.85-\u00c5 resolution.\n\nEnzymatic assay was performed using a fluorogenic substrate with consensus sequence of CoV Mpro, MCA-AVLQSGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2 (>95% purity, GL Biochem Shanghai Ltd., Shanghai, China), as previously reported484953. Fluorescence intensity was monitored using a Fluoroskan Ascent instrument (Thermo Scientific, USA) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 nm and 405 nm, respectively. The assay was performed in a buffer solution consisted of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.3) and 1 mM EDTA at 30 \u00b0C. Kinetic parameters, including Km and kcat of apo HCoV-NL63 Mpro and Ki and k3 of inhibitor N3, were determined using methods described in detail in our previous work49.\n\nHow to cite this article: Wang, F. et al.
