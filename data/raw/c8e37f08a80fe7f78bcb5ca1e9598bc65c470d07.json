{"title": "Supplemental Information Systems Vaccinology Identifies an Early Innate Immune Signature as a Correlate of Antibody Responses to the Ebola Vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV", "body": ". Correlation matrix (Pearson correlation coefficients) between the five early immune response markers selected by sPLS (n=20 trial participants). Related to Figure 4 .\n\nThe matrix depicted shows positive correlations in blue and the negative correlations are shown in red.\n\nThe stronger the intensity of the color, the stronger is the correlation. \n\nEach dot corresponds to a gene, plotted according to its mean log expression on the x-axis and its log fold change on 29 the y-axis. Red dots indicate statistically significant differentially expressed genes. \n\nThe negative log P value along the left y-axis increases with increasing statistical significance of a pathway. The 42 ratio (right y-axis) indicates the proportion of modulated genes relative to all genes present in a given pathway. "}
