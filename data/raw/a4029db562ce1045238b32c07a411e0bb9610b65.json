(see UNIT 14A.3).\n\nVirus stocks are usually at a titer of ~1 \u00d7 10 9 pfu/ml, but may be significantly lower depending on the source. Vortexing usually breaks up any clumps of cells. However, if there are still visible clumps, chill to 0\u00b0C and sonicate 30 sec on ice. Sonication can be repeated several times but the sample should be allowed to cool on ice between sonications.\n\nDilute sonicated virus in complete MEM-2.5 to 0.5 \u00d7 10 5 pfu/ml.

A fine precipitate should appear.\n\nAspirate virus inoculum from monolayer of cells (step 8) and wash twice with PBS. 12a. For lipofectamine method: Add the DNA/lipofectamine solution (step 10a) to the cells and incubate 4 hr at 37\u00b0C.\n\nFor CaCl 2 method: Add the precipitated DNA suspension (step 10b) to the cells and leave 30 min at room temperature, then add 1.5 ml complete MEM-8 and incubate 3 to 4 hr at 37\u00b0C.\n\nAspirate medium, replace with 1 ml MEM-2.5, and incubate 2 days at 37\u00b0C.\n\n14 Dislodge cells with a disposable scraper, plunger from a 1ml syringe or sterile rubber policeman and transfer to a 2-ml sterile microcentrifuge tube.\n\nLyse the cell suspension by performing three freeze-thaw cycles, each time by freezing in a dry ice/ethanol bath, thawing in a 37\u00b0C water bath, and vortexing.\n\nStore the cell lysate at \u2212 80\u00b0C until needed in the selection and screening procedure (see Basic Protocol 2).\n\nFor standard vaccinia strains, procedures are described involving xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (XGPRT; Falkner and Moss, 1988) or thymidine kinase (TK; Mackett et al., 1984) for selecting virus plaques that contain recombinant DNA. A newer and simpler drug-free method (plaque selection) is based on repair of a mutation that caused the parental virus to form pin-point plaques (Blasco and Moss, 1995;  see Background Information regarding choice of procedure). In addition, green fluorescent protein (GFP), \u03b2galactosidase (Chakrabarti et al., 1985) , or \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) screening (Carroll and Moss, 1995) Additional reagents and equipment for tissue culture and counting cells and serial dilution of virus.\n\nNOTE: All reagents and equipment coming into contact with live cells must be sterile, and aseptic technique should be used accordingly. Culture incubations should be performed in a humidified 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 incubator unless otherwise specified.\n\nTrypsinize confluent monolayer culture and resuspend in appropriate complete medium as in UNIT 14A.3, steps 4 to 7 of Basic Protocol 1.\n\nFor XGPRT selection, plaque selection, color or GFP screening, use BS-C-1 cells.\n\nFor TK selection, use HuTK \u2212 143B cells.\n\nFor MVA, use BHK-21 or CEF cells.\n\nCount cells using a cell counter or hemacytometer (APPENDIX 4A).\n\nThe authors use a Nexcelom Cellometer cell counter 3 Plate 5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well in a 6-well tissue culture plate (2 ml/well final).\n\nIncubate until confluent (this should take <24 hr).\n\nPrepare cells as follows.\n\nFor XGPRT selection, preincubate monolayer for 12 to 24 hr in filter-sterilized complete MEM-2.5 containing 1/400 vol 10 mg/ml MPA, 1/40 vol 10 mg/ml xanthine, and 1/670 vol 10 mg/ml hypoxanthine.\n\nFor plaque or TK selection or color screening methods, do not preincubate.\n\nThaw the transfected cell lysate and sonicate 20 to 30 sec in ice-water to break up clumps. Repeat, keeping lysate on ice between steps. \n\nFor plaque selection or fluorescent protein screening, make no additions.\n\nAspirate the virus inoculum from the infected cells (from step 6). Overlay each well with 2 ml appropriate selective medium containing 2.5% methylcellulose. Incubate 2 days.\n\nObtain the plaques 9\n\nAdd 0.5 ml complete MEM-2.5 to sterile microcentrifuge tubes. When incubation period is complete (step 8), pick well-separated plaques by scraping and suction with a pipet tip or scraping with a toothpick. Transfer to a tube containing 0.5 ml complete MEM-2.5. Repeat for six to twelve plaques with separate pipet tips or toothpicks, placing each in a separate tube.\n\nVortex each virus-containing tube, then perform three freeze-thaw cycles, each time by freezing in a dry ice/ethanol bath, thawing in a 37\u00b0C water bath, and vortexing.\n\nPlace tubes containing virus into a cup sonicator containing ice-water and sonicate 20 to 30 sec at full power.\n\nIf TK selection only has been used, plaque isolates should be tested by PCR, DNA dot-blot hybridization, or immunostaining because some plaques will contain spontaneous TK \u2212 mutations and not recombinant virus.\n\nPrepare monolayers of the appropriate cell line as described in steps 1 to 4.\n\nOne 6-well plate is needed for each plaque isolate.\n\nAdd 100, 10, 1, or 0.1 \u03bcl of lysate to duplicate wells containing 1 ml complete MEM-2.5. Gently swirl to mix. Incubate 2 hr. This should be performed with several plaque isolates.\n\nIf XGPRT selection is used, cells must be preincubated with selective drugs and serial dilutions of the viral isolates must also contain selective drugs (step 4, substep a). Note that the parental nonrecombinant virus will form tiny plaques in the presence of drug.\n\n14 Aspirate medium from cell monolayers and overlay with selective medium (if appropriate) containing 2.5% methylcellulose.\n\nRepeat steps 5 to 11 for three or more rounds of plaque purification to ensure a clonally pure recombinant virus.\n\nRecombinant virus from a plaque (obtained after the selection and screening protocols; see Basic Protocol 2) is amplified by infection of successively larger numbers of cells. Medium containing drugs for XGPRT or TK selection is usually used, up to and including the infection of cells in a 25-cm 2 flask. Freeze-thaw cycling is carried out to release the recombinant virus from the cells. The titer of the vaccinia virus or MVA stock is determined as described in UNIT 14A.3. NOTE: All reagents and equipment coming into contact with live cells must be sterile, and aseptic technique should be used accordingly. Incubations should be performed in a humidified 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 incubator unless otherwise specified.\n\n1 Place tube containing recombinant virus from a resuspended plaque into a cup sonicator containing ice-water and sonicate 20 to 30 sec at full power. Cool on ice and repeat.\n\nDilute 0.25 ml of lysate from step 1 with 0.75 ml complete MEM-2.5 containing selective agents, if appropriate (see step 3). Infect appropriate confluent monolayer culture in 6-well plate and incubate 30 min.\n\nIf XGPRT selection is used, the monolayer culture is preincubated for 12 to 24 hr in complete MEM-2.5 containing MPA, xanthine, and hypoxanthine (see Basic Protocol 2, step 4, substep a). Infection should also be done in the presence of these drugs.\n\nOverlay with 1 ml complete MEM-2.5 medium containing the appropriate selective agents.\n\nFor XGPRT selection, include 1/400 vol 10 mg/ml MPA, 1/40 vol 10 mg/ml xanthine, and 1/670 vol 10 mg/ml hypoxanthine.\n\nFor TK selection, include 1/200 vol of 5 mg/ml BrdU.\n\nIncubate 2 days or until cytopathic effect (cell rounding) is obvious.\n\nRemove and discard 1 ml of the medium covering the cell monolayer. Scrape cells, transfer to microcentrifuge tube.\n\nPerform three freeze-thaw cycles, each time by freezing in a dry ice/ethanol bath, thawing in a 37\u00b0C water bath, and vortexing.\n\nPlace tube containing cell suspension into a cup sonicator and sonicate 20 to 30 sec at full power.\n\nScale up the culture 7 Dilute 0.5 ml of lysate from step 6 with 1.5 ml complete MEM-2.5 containing selective agents (see steps 2 and 3). Infect appropriate confluent monolayer culture in a 25-cm 2 flask and incubate 30 min.\n\nOverlay with 3 ml complete MEM-2.5 containing the appropriate selective agents (step 3). Incubate 2 days or until cytopathic effect is obvious.\n\nScrape cells, transfer to 15-ml conical centrifuge tube, and centrifuge 5 min at 1800 \u00d7 g (2500 rpm in H-6000A rotor). Resuspend cells in 1 ml complete MEM-2.5 and repeat freeze-thaw cycling and sonication as described in steps 5 and 6.\n\nDilute 0.5 ml of lysate from step 9 with 4.5 ml complete MEM-2.5. Infect appropriate confluent monolayer culture in a 162-cm 2 flask and incubate 30 min.\n\nOverlay with 25 ml complete MEM-2.5 (selection is not required at this step) and incubate 2-3 days or until cytopathic effect is obvious.\n\nDetach cells from the flask by shaking or scraping if necessary. Transfer to centrifuge tube by pipetting, then centrifuge 5 min at 1800 \u00d7 g. Aspirate and discard supernatant.\n\nResuspend cells in 2 ml complete MEM-2.5 and carry out freeze-thaw cycling three times as described in step 5.\n\n14 Determine titer of the viral stock as described in UNIT 14A.3. Freeze viral stock at \u2212 80\u00b0C.\n\nPlace 10 \u03bcl of lysate from step 13 into 2 ml bacterial growth medium (such as LB) in a 15 ml tube. Shake at 37\u00b0C for 1-2 days. Examine the turbidity of the liquid to ensure the absence of bacterial growth.\n\nLive immunostaining was developed for modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) because this strain does not form discrete, easily recognizable plaques and because this technique helps to avoid the need for incorporation of selectable or screening marker genes. Immunostaining can be used for recombinant proteins that are expressed on the cell surface or in the cytoplasm. These protocols are also applicable to standard strains of vaccinia virus.\n\nThe strong adherence of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) to concavalin A-coated plastic dishes make them superior to BHK-21 or other cell lines that the authors have tried. NOTE: All reagents and equipment coming into contact with live cells must be sterile, and aseptic technique should be used accordingly. Incubations should be performed in a humidified 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 incubator unless otherwise specified.\n\nTrypsinize confluent CEF monolayer cultures, seed cells in concanavalin Acoated 6-well tissue culture plates, and incubate until nearly confluent (UNIT 14A.3).\n\nThaw transfected cell lysate (Basic Protocol 1) and sonicate in a cup sonicator in ice-water for 30 sec at full power. Add 100, 10, 1, or 0.1 \u03bcl of lysate to duplicate wells of CEF containing 1 ml of complete MEM-2.5 medium. Gently swirl to mix. Incubate 2 hr.\n\nAspirate virus inoculum and overlay with complete MEM-2.5 containing 2.5% methylcellulose. Incubate 3 days.\n\nImmunostain the unfixed cells using antibody to the protein product of the foreign gene (see UNIT 14A.3, Support Protocol 3, steps 7 to 13).\n\nIf the protein of interest is expressed intracellularly, remove the fluid from the wells and place plate at \u2212 80\u00b0C for 1 hr. Allow to thaw and begin staining as described in UNIT 16.16. This procedure ruptures the cells in situ and allows the antibody to penetrate.\n\nExamine the cell monolayer using an inverted microscope. Touch immunostaining foci with sterile toothpicks. Place toothpicks individually in small vials containing 0.5 ml of complete MEM-2.5, and break off each toothpick so that the sterile part is inside the tube.\n\nPerform three freeze/thaw cycles on each tube, each time by freezing in a dry ice/ethanol bath, thawing in a 37\u00b0C water bath, and vortexing. Place tube into a cup sonicator containing ice-water and sonicate 30 sec at full power.\n\nReplate onto new CEF monolayers and plaque purify the MVA recombinant a second time as in steps 2 to 6. Plaque purify an additional three times.\n\nIn this protocol, plaque-purification is done under a liquid overlay containing methlycellulose. To check stability and purity, an extra plate can be held for 3 days and then fixed and immunostained as in UNIT 14A.3, Support Protocol 3. The presence of nonstaining foci, which may be detected at this time because of cytopathic effects, are due to wild-type virus or an unstable recombinant.\n\nInfect 1 well of a 6-well plate of CEF or BHK-21 cells with 0.25 ml of plaquepurified MVA recombinant in a total volume of 2 ml MEM-2.5. Incubate 3 days.\n\nRemove and discard 1 ml of medium covering the cell monolayer. Dislodge cells into the 1 ml of remaining medium with a cell scraper (or plunger of a 1 ml syringe) and transfer to a vial. Carry out three freeze/thaw cycles as in step 6 to produce a lysate.\n\nAmplify the virus by inoculating 0.5 ml of lysate into 75-cm 2 flask of CEF or BHK-21 cells containing 15 ml MEM-2.5. After 3 days harvest and lyse cells as in step 9.\n\nInoculate a 162-cm 2 flask of CEF or BHK-21 cells containing 30 ml MEM-2.5 with 0.5 ml of lysate from step 10.\n\nDetermine titer and prepare large stock of recombinant MVA (UNIT 14A.3, Support Protocol 3 and Basic Protocol 5). Freeze viral stock in aliquots at \u2212 80\u00b0C.\n\nThis protocol describes PCR amplification of the DNA fragment inserted into the recombinant virus. The size of the DNA fragment is confirmed by gel electrophoresis and the integrity of the DNA sequence is then verified by sequencing. \n\nInfect a monolayer of cells in one well of a 6-well, 35-mm 2 tissue culture plate with a multiplicity of infection of 5 plaque forming units of the recombinant virus.\n\nIncubate overnight at 37\u00b0C.\n\nScrape cells with the plunger of a 1 ml syringe and transfer to a 2 ml screw-cap tube.\n\nFollow manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen) for preparation of DNA.\n\nAmplify the DNA insert using appropriate oligonucleotides and run on agarose gel to verify the size of the insert\n\nVerify nucleotide sequence of the DNA fragment using standard methods.\n\nThis protocol describes the preparation of concanavalin A-coated plates to be used growing CEF monolayers for live immunostaining as in Basic Protocol 4.\n\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS; APPENDIX 2A)\n\nPlastic bags for storage NOTE: All reagents and equipment coming into contact with live cells must be sterile, and aseptic technique should be used accordingly.\n\nAdd 12 mg concanavalin A to 120 ml sterile PBS for a final concentration of 100 \u03bcg/ml.\n\nAdd 1 ml of the PBS/concanavalin A solution to each well of twenty 6well plates. Incubate 1 hr at room temperature.\n\nAspirate the liquid from each well and rinse with 2 ml PBS.\n\nRemove the fluid from each well and let plates dry by storing open in a biological safety hood (to keep sterile).\n\nStore plates in a plastic bag (to preserve sterility) at room temperature (will keep for months).\n\nUse deionized, distilled water in all recipes and protocol steps. For common stock solutions, see APPENDIX 2A.\n\n0.14 M NaCl The pH of this buffer is critical and should be between 7.0 and 7.1.\n\nVaccinia virus has numerous advantages as an expression vector. The virus is easily propagated and has a wide host range in cultured cells and experimental animals; the large genome has the capacity to incorporate at least 25,000 bp (Smith and Moss, 1983) ; transcription occurs in the cytoplasm bypassing steps in mRNA processing and nuclearcytoplasmic transport; high levels of expression can be achieved; and efficient recombination facilitates insertion of genes. The basic strategy for construction of recombinant vaccinia viruses using plasmid transfer vectors was described more than 30 years ago (Mackett et al., 1984) and is still the most popular method. An alternative strategy is to prepare the DNA by polymerase chain reaction without cloning in bacteria. Still another option involves recombineering artificial chromosomes (Domi and Moss, 2005) . Although the Western Reserve (WR) strain of vaccinia virus has been used most extensively for construction of recombinant viruses, more attenuated strains such as Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara may be preferred primarily for safety reasons and vaccine purposes.\n\nPlasmid-transfer vectors have three essential components: an expression cassette consisting of a natural or synthetic vaccinia virus promoter, restriction endonuclease sites for insertion of foreign genes, and flanking vaccinia virus DNA that determines the site of homologous recombination. An additional component may provide antibiotic selection or color screening. Various transfer vectors are listed in Table 14A .4.1 and one is presented in detail in Figure 14A .4.1.\n\nHomologous recombination (Fig. 14A.4.1) is the usual way of generating recombinant vaccinia viruses. Initially, recombination may result from a single cross-over event, resulting in integration of the circular plasmid and the creation of a tandem duplication; however, this intermediate is highly unstable. A second recombination event then occurs between the tandem repeats, resolving the structure into a small circular DNA molecule and either a wild-type or recombinant viral genome. An alternative method of direct ligation using an unique restriction endonuclese site in the vaccinia genome has also been described (Pfleiderer et al., 1995; Merchlinsky et al., 1997) . This method avoids an E. coli cloning step and can potentially be used for direct cloning of cDNA libraries in vaccinia virus.\n\nConsiderable attention has been devoted to promoters because they affect both the time and level of expression. One commonly used promoter, p 7.5 , contains tandem late and early promoters (Cochran et al., 1985) and provides a moderate level of expression throughout infection. The pm H5 promoter provides higher levels of both early and late expression than p 7.5 (Wyatt et al., 1996) . Strong natural late promoters include p 11 (Bertholet et al., 1985) and p CAE (Patel et al., 1988) . About a two-fold increase in expression may be achieved with the synthetic late promoter in pMJ601 and pMJ602 (Davison and Moss, 1990) or the synthetic early/late compound promoter in pSC59 and pSC65 (Chakrabarti et al., 1997 ; Table 14A .4.1).\n\nThe ability to synthesize many different kinds of proteins, including those with transmembrane domains, is one advantage of the vaccinia virus expression system. Nevertheless, very high expression of certain genes might adversely affect virus replication. If difficulty is experienced in obtaining recombinant vaccinia with strong promoters, the weaker p 7.5 or pm H5 promoter or the inducible vaccinia virus/bacteriophage T7 hybrid system should be tried (ELROY-STEIN AND MOSS, 2001).\n\nMany different methods for selecting recombinant viruses are available. The two simplest, and therefore preferable, methods are selection based on restoration of plaque size or coexpression of a fluorescent protein marker such as green fluorescent protein (GFP). Plaque size selection (Blasco and Moss, 1995) provides an extremely simple method of selecting recombinant vaccinia viruses that involves neither drugs nor reporter genes. The parental virus (vRB12) contains a deletion of most of the F13L gene, which prevents vaccinia virus from making normal-size plaques. The transfer vector pRB21 contains a segment of the F13L gene adjacent to the gene of interest, so that recombinant viruses will have a functional F13L gene and will make normal-size plaques that are easily distinguished from the pinpoint plaques of vRB12. Therefore, one merely needs to pick large plaques to isolate recombinant viruses. However, it is important to check that the virus is a double cross-over recombinant. Co-insertion of GFP or other fluorescent protein marker under control of a vaccinia promoter adjacent to the gene of interest allows easy identification of recombinant plaques using a fluorescence microscope. An example is plasmid pLW-44 (Table 14A .4.1) in which GFP is stably inserted into the recombinant virus. A modification of this method, transient GFP selection, is performed using a transfer vector in which a portion of one of the two vaccinia virus flanking regions that surround the cassette containing GFP and the foreign gene is also inserted between the GFP and foreign gene (Fig. 14A.4.2) . Thus, the GFP gene is flanked by direct repeats from one vaccinia virus flank. GFP-expressing plaques are isolated through several rounds of plaque purification to eliminate parental virus. However, the GFP gene is inherently unstable as recombination will readily occur between the two repeat sequences that surround the gene. Subsequent selection of non-GFPexpressing plaques allows isolation of recombinants that express only the foreign gene. Several rounds of plaque purification are necessary to ensure a pure clonal isolate. It is essential that these plaque isolates be characterized by immunostaining, PCR, or other methods to ensure that the desired gene has been incorporated.\n\nThe TK selection method is based on the insertional inactivation of the thymidine kinase gene (Mortensen and Kingston, 2009 ). In the presence of active TK, added BrdU is phosphorylated and incorporated into viral DNA, where it causes lethal mutations. If TK \u2212 cells are used, then TK \u2212 virus will replicate normally in the presence of BrdU, whereas TK + virus will not. Because the product of a single cross-over event is still TK + , only double cross-over events are selected. However, not all TK \u2212 viral plaques will be recombinants because spontaneous TK \u2212 mutants arise at a frequency of 1:10,000. Depending on the transfection efficiency, recombinants may comprise 10% to >90% of the TK \u2212 plaques.\n\n\u03b2-galactosidase or \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) screening is based on the coinsertion of the E.\n\ncoli lacZ or GUS gene, under the control of a vaccinia virus promoter, into the vaccinia virus genome along with the gene of interest. If the TK gene is insertionally inactivated by such an event, recombinant viruses will be TK \u2212 and will make blue plaques on medium containing Xgal or Xgluc. This combination of color screening and TK selection will discriminate TK \u2212 recombinants from spontaneous TK \u2212 mutants. However, this method has been largely superceded by using fluorescent markers that do not require staining.\n\nXGPRT selection uses mycophenolic acid (MPA), an inhibitor of purine metabolism (see Mortensen and Kingston, 2009) . Because MPA blocks the pathway for GMP synthesis, it interferes with the replication of vaccinia and severely reduces the size of vaccinia plaques. This effect can be overcome, however, by expression of the E. coli gpt gene in the presence of xanthine and hypoxanthine (i.e., XGPRT can use either of these as substrate for synthesis of GMP). Thus, coexpression of XGPRT provides a useful selection system. Usually the XGPRT gene is placed adjacent to the gene of interest and within the vaccinia virus DNA flanking sequences. Unlike the TK \u2212 situation, the viral products arising from both single and double cross-over events will be selected. Therefore, it is important to do successive plaque isolations so that the single cross-over events will be resolved. A reverse-selection procedure can be used to delete the XGPRT gene from a recombinant vaccinia virus or replace it with another gene (Isaacs et al., 1990) . Another procedure, transient XGPRT selection, is performed using a transfer vector with the XGPRT gene outside of the vaccinia virus DNA flanking sequences (Falkner and Moss, 1990) . Under these conditions, only the single crossover recombinant virus will express XGPRT, providing substantial enrichment over the parental virus. However, when MPA selection is removed, the desired double cross-over recombinant virus without the XGPRT gene will have to be differentiated from the parental virus by PCR, immunostaining, or other methods.\n\nTo avoid further impairment of MVA, foreign genes have been targeted to existing deletion sites. Deletion II encompasses parts of the HindIII N-K fragments; deletion III lies within the HindIII A fragment (Meyer et al., 1991) . The TK gene has been successfully used as an insertion site for MVA (Carroll and Moss, 1997; T. Blanchard, pers. comm.) , although there have been reports of some difficulties in isolating stable TK \u2212 MVA (Scheiflinger et al., 1996) . Since there are no MVA-permissive TK \u2212 cell lines, the main attraction for using the TK site is the large number of available transfer vectors that target this site. When some foreign genes were placed under the control of the very strong synthetic early/late promoter, the resulting recombinant MVA were difficult to isolate or unstable (Wyatt et al., 1996) . To date, the examples have been membrane proteins. In most cases, stable recombinants could be made by using a promoter of lower strength, e.g., pm H5 or p 7.5 . When a recombinant protein is somewhat toxic, non-expressing mutants that arise spontaneously can quickly overgrow the culture. To partially circumvent this problem, which has occurred with recombinant genes inserted in deletions II and III, a transfer vector, pLW-73, that directs recombination between two essential genes, I8R and G1L, was developed (Table 14A .4.1). Thus, instability resulting from any deletion of the inserted gene that includes part of either of the two essential flanking genes will result in a non-viable virus that cannot overgrow the culture.\n\nCalcium phosphate transfections are described in detail in Kingston, Chen, and Rose, 2003. As discussed there, obtaining a very fine precipitate of calcium phosphate and DNA is critical for efficient transfection. Several factors can influence the quality of the precipitate. First, the pH of the transfection buffer should be between 7.0 and 7.1. Second, the CaCl 2 should be added slowly and mixed gently (not vortexed), only until full mixing is achieved. The tube should then be left undisturbed until the solution is layered on the cells. Cationic lipids are simpler to use and provide similar or better transfection efficiencies. Although the Lipofectamine procedure was described in this unit, other liposomal or cationic lipids are also effective.\n\nDuring plaque purification and amplification of a new recombinant virus, it is important to maintain the appropriate selective pressure to prevent growth of any contaminating wild-type virus. After isolation, selection is not required. Check the purity of a recombinant virus by PCR amplification from the flanking DNA sequences. It is also advisable to perform DNA sequencing of the insert to ensure that no mutations have arisen, especially if a PCR product was used for transfection of the foreign gene. Immunostaining is another method that can be used to verify that all plaques/foci express the gene of interest. Non-expressing plaques/foci can be identified by microscopic visualization or double immunostaining. The latter technique requires an antibody to the expressed protein and one to vaccinia with different species specificities. This method has been used routinely with MVA recombinants.\n\nFreezing vaccinia virus stocks causes clumping of particles; thus, stocks should be sonicated after thawing. This is particularly important when plaque-purifying a virus, as each plaque should have arisen from a single virus.\n\nIt is prudent to save half of each stock at each step in case of contamination or failure at a succeeding step. The authors strongly recommend preparation of a seed stock of the final recombinant virus that will be adequate for future needs. A common mistake is to continually passage the virus.\n\nIf immunostaining is used instead of selection or color screening, the antibody must give a good signal to initially pick out the few small foci of cells infected with recombinant virus among a great excess of cells infected with the parental nonstaining virus. Before using an antibody for isolation of recombinant MVA, it can be tested by staining the MVA-infected cells after the first transfection step.\n\nApproximately 1-5 \u00d7 10 10 pfu of purified virus should be obtained per liter of 5 \u00d7 10 8 HeLa cells.\n\nDepending on the efficiency of the transfection, single, well-isolated plaques should be visible in cells infected with one of the recommended virus dilutions. With TK selection, from 10% to 90% of the plaques will contain recombinant virus. If GFP, \u03b2-galactosidase or GUS screening is also used, only fluorescent or blue recombinant virus plaques should be picked. With XGPRT selection, all plaques picked should contain recombinant virus. If the titer of recombinant virus is low, amplification can be achieved by a round of growth in the presence of MPA prior to plaquing (use the procedure described in amplification of a plaque).\n\nCytopathic effects should be clearly visible at each step of amplification of vaccinia vius except with final infection (infected HeLa cells do not exhibit clear cytopathic effects). The titer of the final crude stock should be 1-2 \u00d7 10 9 pfu/ml.\n\nThe infection/transfection procedure for generation of recombinant virus takes ~6 hr and cells are harvested after 2 days.\n\nEach round of selection and plaque purification takes 2-3 days, although little working time is required. Plaques can be picked and reinfections performed on the same day.\n\nAmplification of a single plaque isolate to a small high-titer crude stock will take ~7 days. Large stocks should then be prepared as described in UNIT 14A.3.\n\nTransfection of cells with the plasmid transfer vector requires ~2 hr to complete, and the cells are harvested after 2 days. Each round of isolation and plaque purification requires about 30 min for infection, 2 days for incubation, 3 hr for color or immunostaining, and 2 hr for isolating new recombinants and freeze-thaw cycling. Recombinant isolates can be picked and reinfections performed on the same day. From completion of plaque purification to the preparation and titering of a virus stock takes another 10 days. Homologous recombination between a transfected plasmid and the vaccinia virus genome demonstrating transient GFP selection. In the first recombination event, both GFP and the foreign gene are integrated into the vaccinia virus genome. Instability due to the presence of two direct repeats flanking the GFP gene result in a second recombination event upon passage that eliminates the GFP gene but maintains the foreign gene.
