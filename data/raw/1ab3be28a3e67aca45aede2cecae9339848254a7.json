{"title": "Emodin is a novel alkaline nuclease inhibitor that suppresses herpes simplex virus type 1 yields in cell cultures", "body": "Herpes simplex virus (HSV) causes herpes labialis, herpes keratitis, genetic herpes and life-threatening herpes encephalitis. HSV infections are more severe in immunocompromised patients, which are characterized by chronic and extensive lesions of the mucous membranes (Whitley, 2001) . Most therapies directed against HSV infections are nucleotides, nucleosides or pyrophosphate analogues, such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, penciclovir and famciclovir. After uptake by virus-infected cells, these drugs are phosphory-lated by virus-encoded thymidine kinase, compete with the nucleotides to inhibit the viral DNA polymerase and subsequently cause the termination of growing viral DNA chains (Field, 2001) . Although these drugs are effective in the treatment of many acute infections, the intensive use of these drugs has led to the emergence of resistant viral strains, mainly in immunocompromised patients (Field, 2001) . Therefore, there is a need to provide other drugs with distinct mechanisms as alternatives to existing therapies.\n\nAlkaline nuclease, which is encoded by the UL12 gene of HSV-1, possesses both endonuclease and exonuclease activities under alkaline pH conditions (Hoffmann and Cheng, 1978; McGeoch et al., 1986; Knopf and Weisshart, 1990) . Null mutants incapable of expressing UL12 are able to synthesize near wild-type levels of viral DNA, suggesting that UL12 is not essential for viral DNA replication in culture (Weller et al., 1991) . Although UL12 is not essential for viral DNA synthesis, UL12 mutant viral yields are 0.1-1% of wildtype yields (Shao et al., 1993; Martinez et al., 1996a) . The analysis of UL12 null mutants has shown that the decrease in virus yield results from the reduction of capsids exiting from the nucleus (Martinez et al., 1996b; Goldstein and Weller, 1998) . Analysis of replicating DNA from UL12 mutantinfected cells has shown that UL12 is implicated in resolving branched structures of HSV-1 replicative intermediates prior to encapsidation (Martinez et al., 1996a; Porter and Stow, 2004a, b) . Therefore, these results indicate that, even though UL12 is not essential for either viral DNA synthesis or packaging, UL12 is required for full efficiency of these processes. Additionally, these findings suggest that HSV-1 UL12 can be a novel target for anti-herpes viral drugs.\n\nIncreasing the emergence of resistant viral strains has highlighted the crucial need for the development of new anti-herpes virus drugs with different mechanisms. Several potential viral targets, such as helicase-primase complex and DNA polymerase, have been known to be involved in HSV-1 infection and for which specific inhibitors with anti-HSV activity, at least in cell cultures, have been identified (Crute et al., 2002; Thomsen et al., 2003; Greco et al., 2007) . In the present study, we analysed the potent inhibitor of HSV-1 that targeted viral UL12. Our findings indicated that emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylanthraquinone), the naturally occurring anthraquinone present in the root and bark of numerous plants of the genera Rheum and Polygonum, inhibited HSV-1 UL12 activity, leading to the accumulation of nucleocapsids in the nucleus and the subsequent reduction of HSV-1 yields in Vero cells.\n\nAll chemicals, except where indicated, were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, MO, USA). Plant materials were purchased from Sun Ten Pharmaceutical Corporation (Taipei, Taiwan). Plant samples were ground to fine powders with homogenizers and extracted with methanol, as described previously (Chen et al., 2007a) . Emodin and its analogues were dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mM NaCl, 1.4 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 4.3 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.2). Bovine pancreatic DNase I was purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA, USA). Mouse anti-HSV-1 nucleocapsid protein monoclonal antibody and fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody were purchased from USBiological (Swampscott, MA, USA) and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA, USA), respectively.\n\nAfrican green monkey kidney cells (Vero cells), which were purchased from Bioresource Collection and Research Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) and grown at 37 1C in a humidified CO 2 atmosphere. Laboratory strain (KOS) of HSV-1 was used, and the viral stock was prepared and titrated in Vero cells.\n\nCloning, expression and purification of recombinant HSV-1 UL12 To clone the HSV-1 UL12 gene, viral genomic DNA was extracted from HSV-1-infected Vero cells as described previously and amplified for 35 cycles with UL12-P (5 0 -TCG GATCCATGGAGTCCACGGTAGGCCCAGC-3 0 ) and UL12-M (5 0 -CGAATTCGGTCAGCGAGACGACCTCCCCG-3 0 ) primers (Hsiang et al., 1996; Wu et al., 1998) . The 1897-bp UL12 gene fragment was inserted into EcoR I and BamH I sites of histidine-tagged expression vector pET-28a( \u00fe ) (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA) to create the pET-UL12. Recombinant UL12 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS strain by transforming the pET-UL12 to produce an N-terminal fusion with six histidine residues. The protein was purified by affinity chromatography as described previously Ho et al., 2000) . Purified protein was analysed by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, quantified with a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and stored at \u00c070 1C until further assays.\n\nNuclease activity assay Plasmid pUC18 dsDNA, prepared by Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), was mixed with purified UL12 in DNase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated at 37 1C. The reaction was then stopped by the addition of stop solution (25% glycerol, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulphate, 0.05% bromophenol blue, 50 mM EDTA), and the resulting products were analysed by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels. The intensities of substrates on the gel were measured by Gel-Pro Analyzer (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA). Nuclease activity (%) was calculated by ((intensity of untreated substrate\u00c0intensity of nuclease-treated substrate)/intensity of untreated substrate) \u00c2 100%.\n\nPlaque reduction assay was performed as described previously with a slight modification (Hodinka et al., 2000) . Cell monolayers, cultured in 24-well culture plates, were infected with 30 plaque-forming units (PFU) of HSV-1 for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently for 30 min at 37 1C. The viruses were then discarded, and the cells were overlaid with 1 mL of 1% methylcellulose medium containing emodin and incubated at 37 1C in a humidified CO 2 atmosphere. Three days later, cells were fixed and stained by 0.5% crystal violet in 50% methanol, and the number of plaques was counted (Hsiang et al., 2001) . EC 50 value was determined as the quantity of emodin required to reduce the plaque number by 50%.\n\nCell viability was monitored by MTT colorimetric assay as described previously (Lee et al., 2007) . Briefly, cells were treated with emodin for 16 h. One-tenth volume of 5 mg mL \u00c01 MTT was then added to the culture medium. After a 4-h incubation at 37 1C, equal cell culture volume of 0.04 N HCl in isopropanol was added to dissolve the MTT formazan, and the absorbance value was measured at 570 nm using an ELISA plate reader. Cell viability (%) was calculated by (OD of emodin-treated cells/OD of solvent-treated cells) \u00c2 100.\n\nVero cells (10 4 cells) were seeded in 24-well plates containing glass coverslips and incubated at 37 1C. One day later, cells were infected with 30 PFU of HSV-1 for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently for 30 min at 37 1C. The viruses were then discarded and the cells were overlaid with medium containing various amounts of emodin at 37 1C for indicated time. The coverslips were then rinsed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% PBS-buffered formaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min and blocked with 1% BSA at 37 1C for 1 h. After four washes with PBS, diluted mouse anti-HSV-1 nucleocapsid monoclonal antibody was added to each coverslip and incubated at 4 1C overnight. After four washes with PBS, diluted FITC-conjugated secondary antibody was added and incubated at 37 1C for 90 min in the dark. The coverslips were then washed four times with PBS, placed onto glass slides, mounted with fluoromount G (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA), and observed under a confocal microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).\n\nProtein structure prediction and docking technology UL12 protein structure was generated via the Meta Server (http://bioinfo.pl/). (Ginalski et al., 2003) . The MEDock (Maximum Entropy based Docking) web server (http:// bioinfo.mc.ntu.edu.tw/medock/) was used for the prediction of ligand-binding sites (Chang et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2007b) . The input file was in the PDBQ format, which is an extension of the PDB format. The PDBQ format for emodin has been generated by Dundee's PRODRG server (http:// davapc1.bioch.dundee.ac.uk/programs/prodrg/) (Schuttelkopf and van Aalten, 2004) .\n\nData are presented as mean\u00b1s.e.mean. Student's t-test was used for comparisons between two experiments. A value of Po0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nThe nuclease activity of HSV-1 UL12 was analysed on different forms of pUC18 dsDNA and observed by agarose electrophoresis. When linear pUC18 dsDNA was treated with UL12, a smear was visible after 2 min of digestion and pUC18 dsDNA was totally degraded after 10 min ( Figure 1a ). When supercoiled pUC18 dsDNA was treated with UL12, it was firstly converted into an open circular form and then converted into full-length linear dsDNA ( Figure 1b) . With increasing incubation time, the supercoiled form of pUC18 dsDNA was gradually degraded, and the open circular and linear forms of pUC18 dsDNA were completely degraded. These results indicated that recombinant HSV-1 UL12 exhibited both exonuclease and endonuclease activities, which are consistent with previous studies (Bronstein and Weber, 1996) .\n\nRheum officinale inhibits the nuclease activity of HSV-1 UL12 In a previous study, we found that Rheum officinale, Paeonia suffruticosa, Melia toosendan, and Sophora flavescens are able to inhibit HSV-1 productions in Vero cells through prevention of viral attachment or penetration (Hsiang et al., 2001) . We are interested to know whether these herbs also inhibit the UL12 activity. Therefore, the methanolic extracts of these herbs were mixed with HSV-1 UL12 and the nuclease activity was analysed. As shown in Figure 2 , the methanolic extract of R. officinale inhibited the UL12 activity in a dosedependent manner. Three other herbs did not show the inhibitions on UL12 activity (data not shown). Methanol alone did not affect the UL12 activity (data not shown). Therefore, these results indicated that, in addition to virus attachment, R. officinale exhibited an anti-UL12 activity.\n\nEmodin inhibits the nuclease activity of HSV-1 UL12 with specificity Emodin is the naturally occurring anthraquinone present in R. officinale (Koyama et al., 2003) . Therefore, we are (1 pmol) was mixed with 0.1 mg of EcoR I-linearized (a) or supercoiled pUC18 dsDNA (b) in the reaction buffer. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 1C for the indicated periods, and the resulting products were analysed by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels. Lane M represents the reaction performed in the absence of UL12. Arrowheads denote the different topological forms of pUC18 plasmids. OC, open circular; L, linear; SC, supercoiled; HSV-1, herpes simplex virus type 1.\n\nEmodin inhibits HSV-1 yields in vitro C-Y Hsiang and T-Y Ho interested to know whether emodin inhibits the nuclease activity of HSV-1 UL12. As shown in Figure 3a , the input DNA was totally degraded in the absence of emodin.\n\nHowever, with increasing concentrations, the nuclease activity of UL12 was gradually inhibited by emodin. DMSO alone did not affect the UL12 activity (data not shown). To further analyse the specificity of emodin, pUC18 dsDNA was mixed with emodin-treated bovine pancreatic DNase I. As shown in Figure 3b , the input DNA (supercoiled pUC18 dsDNA) was converted into open circular and linear forms in the presence of DNase I. With increasing concentrations, the endonuclease activity of DNase I was consistent. Therefore, these findings indicated that emodin is likely to be the active compound of R. officinale, which inhibited the UL12 activity with specificity.\n\nEmodin is an anthraquinone compound consisting of three cyclic rings. We wonder whether the other emodin analogues exhibit better anti-UL12 abilities than emodin. Similar to emodin, rhein (1,8-dihydroxy-3-carboxyl-9-10anthraquinone) and anthraquinone consist of three cyclic rings (Figure 4a ). In contrast to emodin, they consist of different functional groups. 1,4-Bis-(1-anthraquinonylamino)anthraquinone consists of nine cyclic rings. The antipsychotic drug promazine shares a similar structure with emodin. Although the structural similarity is observed among these emodin analogues, emodin was the only compound that significantly inhibited the nuclease activity of HSV-1 UL12 (Figure 4b) .\n\nEmodin reduces the plaque formation by the accumulation of nucleocapsids in the nucleus To test whether emodin inhibited HSV-1 yields, Vero cells were infected with HSV-1 and then overlaid with methylcellulose medium containing various amounts of emodin. As shown in Figure 5 , DMSO alone did not affect the number of Results are expressed as relative UL12 activity, which is presented as a comparison, with the nuclease activity of R. officinale-treated UL12 relative to solvent-treated UL12. Values are mean\u00b1s.e.mean of three independent experiments. **Po0.01, compared with solventtreated UL12 activity. HSV-1, herpes simplex virus type 1.\n\nEmodin inhibits HSV-1 yields in vitro C-Y Hsiang and T-Y Ho plaques. Emodin decreased the number and the size of plaques in a dose-dependent manner. The EC 50 of emodin was 21.5\u00b14.4 mM. Moreover, no significant loss of mitochondrial function was detected by MTT assay. Therefore, these findings indicated that emodin reduced the plaque formation by the inhibition of UL12 activity. Previous studies indicated that HSV-1 UL12 is involved in viral DNA processing and capsid egression (Martinez et al., 1996b; Goldstein and Weller, 1998) . We wondered whether emodin induces the accumulation of nucleocapsids in the nucleus by the inhibition of UL12 activity. Immunohistochemical staining, using anti-HSV-1 nucleocapsid protein antibody, was therefore performed to analyse the localiza-tion of viral nucleocapsids during emodin treatment. No fluorescent signal was observed in mock cells ( Figure 6a ). As expected, the nucleocapsids were localized diffusely in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm at 16 h post-infection because the HSV-1 progenies are assembled and released from cells at 16 h post-infection . In contrast, emodin induced the accumulation of nucleocapsid protein in the nucleus in a dose-dependent manner at 16 h postinfection. Time course assay showed that, in the absence of emodin, nucleocapsids mainly remained in the nucleus at 3 h post-infection, diffused to cytoplasm at 5 h post-infection, and mainly localized in cytoplasm at 8 h post-infection. In contrast, the fluorescent signal mainly remained in the Emodin inhibits HSV-1 yields in vitro C-Y Hsiang and T-Y Ho nucleus during emodin treatment. These findings suggest that emodin inhibited HSV-1 UL12 activity, leading to the accumulation of nucleocapsids in the nucleus and the subsequent reduction of HSV-1 yields. Our findings are also consistent with previous studies showing that UL12 is involved in the egression of capsid from the nucleus (Martinez et al., 1996b; Goldstein and Weller, 1998) .\n\nWe further investigated the binding site of emodin in UL12 by docking technology. To achieve this, we modelled the three-dimensional structure of HSV-1 UL12. The modelling of HSV-1 UL12 was performed using the FFAS03 and SWISS-MODEL Workspace (http://swissmodel.expasy.org/ workspace/index.php) (Jaroszewski et al., 2005; Arnold et al., 2006) . A significant similarity, with the FFAS03 score of \u00c019.2, was found between UL12 and phage l exonuclease. A full atom three-dimensional structure of HSV-1 UL12 was, therefore, modelled using the phage l exonuclease (PDB code 1avq) as the reference protein (Figure 7a ). Emodin wholly docked into the pocket of UL12, with the predicted binding energy score of \u00c076.67 kcal mol \u00c01 . Emodin exhibited critical hydrogen bonds with Asp-227, Val-273, Val-365, and Lys-366 residues of UL12 ( Figure 7b ). Hydrophobic interactions with Trp-231, Asp-340, and Glu-364 residues of UL12 were also found.\n\nAntiviral drugs have been used for the treatment of HSV infections for over 45 years (Field, 2001) . Acyclovir is of significant therapeutic value and is considered as the 'gold standard' in HSV therapy. However, approximately 5% of the isolates from immunocompromised patients, which receive a long-term prophylactic treatment with acyclovir, have experienced the emergence of resistant strains (Danve-Szatanek et al., 2004) . Even in immunocompetent populations, the prevalence of resistance ranges from 0.32 to 3.5% by large-scale studies (Fife et al., 1994; Danve-Szatanek et al., 2004) . Therefore, the development of antiviral drugs with different mechanisms is an alternative approach to the control of HSV infections. Viral proteins, that are known to be involved in HSV infection, have been used as the targets for chemotherapy. For examples, viral glycoproteins together with the cell membrane receptors are involved in viral attachment and penetration (Rajc\u00e1ni and Vojvodov\u00e1, 1998) . Sulphated polymer-based inhibitors, which interact directly with viral envelope glycoproteins and prevent viral attachment, are now being tested in Phase II or III clinical trials (Keller et al., 2005) . Helicase-primase complex is essential for the unwinding of dsDNA and the generation of primers for DNA synthesis (Boehmer and Lehman, 1997) . Aminothiazolylphenyl compounds (BILS 179 BS and BILS 45 BS) and thiazolyl sulphonamide compound (BAY 57-1293), that prevent the propagation of helicase-primase catalytic cycle and inhibit its ATPase activity, respectively, display potent anti-HSV effects in mice (Crute et al., 2002; Duan et al., 2003; Biswas et al., 2007) . Viral DNA polymerase is essential for DNA replication (Boehmer and Lehman, 1997) . 4-Hydroxyquinoline-3-carboxamides (PNU-182171 and PNU-183792), Emodin inhibits HSV-1 yields in vitro C-Y Hsiang and T-Y Ho that compete with incoming nucleotides and dislodge the template from the active site, display anti-herpes virus activities in preclinical animal studies (Thomsen et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2006) . In principle, all the replicationessential viral proteins can be considered as potential targets for chemotherapy. This has raised the question. Is UL12 a possible candidate for anti-herpes virus therapy? Although UL12 mutants are able to synthesize near wild-type levels of viral DNA, the yields of mutant virus are reduced by 100-to 1000-fold (Shao et al., 1993; Martinez et al., 1996a) . UL12 mutants display the failure of DNA-containing capsids to migrate into the cytoplasm and the more complex structure of replicative intermediates with an increased frequency of branches (Martinez et al., 1996b; Goldstein and Weller, 1998; Porter and Stow, 2004a, b) . Additionally, antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, targeting an internal start codon of HSV-1 UL12 mRNA, inhibit HSV-1 replication in Vero cells (Chiba et al., 2000) . Furthermore, emodin, that inhibited UL12 activity in vitro, displayed the reduction of HSV-1 yields in Vero cells in this study. These findings indicated that UL12, which is conserved in all species of Herpesviridae, can be considered as the target for the anti-herpes virus therapy.\n\nEmodin, the active principle of herbal medicine derived from genera Rheum and Polygonum, has demonstrated antiviral effects to some enveloped viruses, such as hepatitis B virus, HSV, human cytomegalovirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, and non-enveloped viruses, such as poliovirus (Barnard et al., 1992; Cohen et al., 1996; Semple et al., 2001; Dang et al., 2006; Ho et al., 2007) . Several studies have revealed that the antiviral activity of emodin is through casein kinase 2 (CK2) inhibition, which is exploited by viruses for the phosphorylation of proteins that are essential for viral life cycle (Yim et al., 1999; Battistutta et al., 2000) . Moreover, emodin has affinity for phospholipid membrane and is effective in weakening hydrophobic interactions between hydrocarbon chains in phospholipid bilayers, contributing to the antiviral capacity of emodin against enveloped viruses (Sydiskis et al., 1991; Alves et al., 2004) . In this study, we demonstrated that emodin can exert its antiviral activity by the third mechanism, the inhibition of HSV-1 UL12 alkaline nuclease activity. These findings suggest that emodin may be a potential anti-HSV-1 candidate with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities.\n\nOur results indicate that emodin inhibits HSV-1 UL12 activity, leading to the reduction of HSV-1 yields in Vero cells. How did emodin inhibit nuclease activity of HSV-1 UL12? To answer this question, we modelled the threedimensional structure of UL12 using phage l exonuclease as the template protein. Although HSV-1 UL12 exhibits a low amino acid sequence similarity (13.6%) with l exonuclease, HSV-1 UL12 shares similar enzyme activities and biological functions with l exonuclease. For example, both proteins preferentially degrade DNA from double-stranded end in the 5 0 -3 0 direction (Cassuto and Radding, 1971; Knopf and Weisshart, 1990) . Moreover, they mediate DNA strand exchange by interacting with ssDNA-binding protein and participate in initiating viral recombination events (Muniyappa and Radding, 1986) . The recognizable homology suggests that using l exonuclease as the template for the modelling of UL12 is reasonable. The interaction of emodin with UL12 was predicted by docking analysis. Results showed that emodin docked into UL12 but not bovine pancreatic DNase I (data not shown). Emodin interacted with and Lys-366 of UL12 via hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic interactions. Interestingly, some of these amino acid residues may be critical for the nuclease activity. Site-directed mutagenesis on the HSV-1 UL12 homologue, Epstein-Barr virus DNase, has revealed that Asp-203, Glu-225 and Lys-227 of Epstein-Barr virus DNase, corresponding to Asp-340, Glu-364 and Lys-366 of UL12, respectively, play important roles in catalysis (Liu et al., 2003) . Glu-225 of Epstein-Barr virus DNase, corresponding to Glu-364 of UL12, is involved in metal binding. The docking of emodin into UL12 may affect or occupy the catalytic site of UL12, leading to the inhibition of nuclease activity. Therefore, the interaction between emodin and critical amino acid residues of UL12 may explain why emodin inhibited the nuclease activity of HSV-1 UL12.\n\nIn conclusion, emodin significantly reduced the plaque formation in Vero cells. Serum profiles after oral administration of emodin at a dosage of 2 g kg \u00c01 in mice showed that the peak serum concentration of emodin is 700 mM (Mengs et al., 1997) . We revealed that emodin at a concentration of 21.5 mM was sufficient to reduce 50% virus yields without cytotoxic effect. Moreover, there is no evidence or equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of emodin in rats or mice (National Toxicology Program, 2001) . Therefore, we speculate that the antiviral effect of emodin measured in vitro may occur in vivo. Furthermore, in addition to the inhibition of UL12, emodin possesses antiviral activities via the disruption of phospholipid bilayer and the inhibition of CK2. Therefore, these results suggest that emodin may be a potent herpes viral inhibitor with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities."}
