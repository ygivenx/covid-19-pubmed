{"title": "A new subunit vaccine based on nucleoprotein nanoparticles confers partial clinical and virological protection in calves against bovine respiratory syncytial virus", "body": "Human and bovine respiratory syncytial viruses (HRSV and BRSV) are two closely related, highly infectious, worldwide prevalent viruses that are the leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract disease in children and calves, respectively [1] . RSV is a negative strand RNA virus that belongs to the Pneumovirus genus within the Paramyxoviridae family. The frequency and seriousness of BRSV diseases are regarded as the principal health problem in calf rearing worldwide and are responsible for large economic losses in dairy and beef farming. The frequency of BRSV infections is very high in cattle less than 1-year-old and the virus may be responsible for vaccine is the dramatic failure in the late sixties of a formalin inactivated HRSV vaccine that not only failed to protect against subsequent infection but also induced exacerbated disease in children [5] . Vaccine augmented disease has also been described in calves and some commercial BRSV vaccines were withdrawn from the market for that reason [6, 7] . Other obstacles to vaccination exist, such as the need to immunize immunologically immature young infants and the presence of maternal antibodies that can have a strong suppressive effect on the outcome of vaccination, both in animals and humans.\n\nExperimental models in rodents have been developed to find out the immune correlates of protection versus disease exacerbation and help the conception of safe RSV vaccines. Altogether these studies highlight the delicate tuning between cytotoxic anti-viral CD8 T cells and RSV-specific antibodies, which, although generally protective against RSV infection, may both have deleterious effect [8] . For instance, poorly neutralizing antibodies with low avidity for the protective RSV epitopes can lead to enhanced respiratory syncytial virus disease [9] . The RSV-F and G glycoproteins, which are situated at the surface of the virions, are the targets of neutralizing antibodies. Research on HRSV subunit vaccines has essentially focused on these two proteins, by using chimeric FG glycoprotein, full-length F proteins or a recombinant protein containing the central antigenic domain of the HRSV G protein fused to the C-terminal end of the albumin-binding domain of the streptococcal G protein [10] . However, recombinant G and F or chimeric FG were often found to cause enhancement of lung pathology upon RSV challenge, in association with the priming of Th2 cells [1, 11] .\n\nIn addition to the risk of disease exacerbation by vaccination, another critical issue for human or bovine RSV vaccination is the variability of the viral isolates circulating worldwide. An effective bovine or human vaccine should protect against all of them. The nucleoprotein (N) that covers the viral RNA genome, forming the viral nucleocapsid, is the most conserved of RSV proteins and is a major target of the cellular immune response against RSV [12] [13] [14] . Thus, contrary to F or G antigens, N based vaccines offer the possibility of T-cell-mediated cross-protective immunity against circulating RSV. Strategies aimed at using N in a vaccine to stimulate T cell immunity have focused on live-attenuated virus vector and on DNA vaccine. Vaccination of mice with recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the HRSV N protein induced partial protection [15, 16] . Similarly, immunization of young calves with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the BRSV N protein induced non-neutralizing antibodies and primed BRSV-specific proliferative T response and IFN-\u2425 production that resulted in reduction of viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract [17] . DNA immunization by two administrations of plasmids encoding BRSV-F and N proteins primed a strong cell-mediated immunity in calves, which drastically reduced viral replication, clinical signs and pulmonary lesions after a highly virulent challenge [18] . More recently a nucleocapsidbased DNA prime-protein boost vaccination was shown to confer protection against BRSV replication and lung pathology [19] .\n\nCompared to DNA, or live-attenuated vector vaccines, subunit vaccines are safer because they do not present the risk of replication/integration of genetically modified material. However subunit vaccines using the nucleoprotein (N) have been poorly investigated, in part because a recombinant N was difficult to produce as a soluble protein. We have set up an original technology to engineer circular nanoparticles composed of 10-11 recombinant N [20] , the 3D structures of which have just been solved [21] . These nanoparticles are named N SRS for sub-nucleocapsid ring structures [20] . Intranasal vaccination of mice with HRSV N SRS nanoparticles primes N-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells and significantly reduces titers of RSV in the lungs of mice following HRSV challenge without signs of disease exacerbation [22] . One major limit of the mouse model is the absence of respiratory disease in response to RSV infec-tion. Therefore the objectives of the present study were to evaluate the potency of N SRS as a vaccine in calves that are the natural host for BRSV and that display clinical respiratory symptoms and lung lesions upon infection. Because the N amino acid sequence is highly conserved between bovine and human RSV strains (\u224894% amino acid identity), we took it as an opportunity to test whether N SRS from HRSV strain Long would provide cross-protective immunity against viral challenge with a BRSV strain. The data presented in this study showed that vaccination with the nano-rings N SRS partially protected against both respiratory disease and virus replication upon BRSV challenge without signs of vaccine-mediated disease exacerbation.\n\nThe pGEX-PCT (coding for residues 161-241 of the C-terminal fragment of the phosphoprotein, named PCT, fused to glutathione-S-transferase) and pET-N plasmids which contain sequences from the HRSV Long strain have been described previously [20] . Randomprimed cDNA synthesis was done using SuperscriptII (GIBCO, Invitrogen Life Science, France) and 1 g of total cytoplasmic RNA isolated from bovine Turbinate cells infected with the A2Gelfi strain of BRSV [23, 24] . The cDNAs were amplified by PCR with high fidelity PfuTurbo Polymerase (5U, Stratagene, Agilent Technologies, France) and 100 ng of the following primers: N-A2G+: 5 -GAGGAGCCATGGCTCTTAGCAAGGTCAAACTAAATG-3 ; N-A2G\u2212: 5 -GAGGAGCTCGAGTCACAATTCCACATCATTATCTTTGG-3 ; P-A2G+: 5 -GAGGGATCCATGGCTGCTCGTGATGGTATAAGAGATG-CCATG-3 ; P-A2G\u2212: 5 -GAGGAGCTCGAGTCAGAAATCTTCAAGTGATAGATCA-TTGTC-3 .\n\nThe amplified full-length cDNA coding for BRSV N protein was digested subsequently by NcoI and XhoI and cloned into pET-28a(+) vector (Novagen, Merck Chemicals products, Germany). The PCT coding for amino acid residues 161-241 of BRSV P protein was digested subsequently by BamHI and XhoI and inserted into the pGEX-4T3 expression vector (Pharmacia, France). Constructs were verified by sequencing.\n\nproteins from E. coli E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Merck Chemicals products, Germany) cells were co-transformed with the pGEX-PCT and pET-N plasmids coding for either BRSV or HRSV proteins. Recombinant protein expression was induced by IPTG and proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity (Pharmacia, France). HRSV N + PCT complexes were separated from glutathione-Sepharose beads by biotinylated-thrombin cleavage in Tris 10 mM pH 8.5, NaCl 140 mM and thrombin was removed by the Thrombin Cleavage Capture kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Novagen, Merck Chemicals products, Germany). This protocol allows the purification of recombinant HRSV N proteins via their capacity to interact with the C-terminal fragment of P fused to GST (named GST-PCT) as previously described [20] . According to this procedure, 10 to 11 N proteins assemble into ring-shaped structures containing RNA subsequently named N SRS for sub-nucleocapsid ring structures [20] . Two hundred and fifty milligrams of HRSV N SRS were produced.\n\nFor i.m. injection, N SRS was formulated in Montanide TM ISA71 VG (SEPPIC, Air Liquide, France) at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Montanide TM ISA 71 VG is a blend of oil and an ester from mannitol sugar and oleic fatty acid (anhydromannitol octadecenoate ether) with specific emulsifying properties due to its sugar polar head, its non-ionicity and the specificity of fatty acid chains of the surfactant system. The oleic acid and the sugar polar part used are from a vegetable origin. Experimental small scale vaccine emulsion was performed using silverson L4RT with tubular system mixer. The ratio of Montanide TM 71 VG/aqueous phase was 7 g of adjuvant/3 g antigenic phase. Montanide TM 71 VG was added first in a beaker and the head of the silverson was placed in the oil with agitation at 1000 rpm. The appropriate amount of antigenic phase (at the same temperature than the Montanide TM 71 VG) was then added progressively, and the rotation speed was increased to 5000 rpm for 3 min, with gentle moving of the beaker. To control that N SRS were not denatured in emulsion with Montanide TM ISA71 VG, 0.1 ml of butanol was added to 1 ml of emulsion, resulting in separation of aqueous and organic phases. Proteins present in the aqueous phase were dosed and imaged by negative-stain microscopy with a Philips CM12 microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV.\n\nFor i.n. administration, N SRS was formulated in 25% (V/V) Montanide TM IMS 4132 VG (SEPPIC, Air Liquide, France) at a final concentration of 5 mg/ml. Montanide TM IMS 4132 VG is a ready to dilute water-soluble vaccine adjuvant. Montanide TM IMS are an association of apolar amphiphile nanoparticles combined with a soluble immunostimulant. All raw materials used in this formulation have monographs in different pharmacopeia and/or are already used in injectables for human. This adjuvant has been specifically selected for the intranasal trial due to its high spreadability. Experimental vaccine formulation was done by a simple dilution of the antigenic media in the adjuvant under gentle magnetic steering.\n\nBRSV isolate 3761 (BRSV-3761) was isolated from a nasal swab of a calf with distress respiratory syndrome in 2003 [1] . The virus was then replicated for five passages in Bovine Turbinate cells (American Type Culture Collection, CRL 1390) and was amplified by 3 passages in newborn calves to give the BRSV-3761 inoculum. Passages in newborn calves were performed as follows: a 2-days-old calf, deprived of colostrum and maternal antibodies, was inoculated by intranasal and intratracheal routes with 10 6 PFU of BRSV-3761. Calf was euthanized under anesthesia 5 days later and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in the lung with 500 ml of MEM medium supplemented with enrofloxacin (0.02 g/ml, Baytril 5%, Bayer, France) and fungizone (2.5 g/ml, Invitrogen Life Science, France). This BAL was snap frozen at \u2212180 \u2022 C. The same method was used to obtain and store BAL at the second and third passages. The challenge inoculum of the present study consisted of the BAL at the third passage and was free of the following bovine respiratory pathogens: Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma bovis, Bovine Viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine parainfluenza type 3, bovine Adenovirus 3, bovine coronavirus, and bovine herpesvirus 1. The titre of the challenge inoculum was 5 \u00d7 10 3 PFU/ml. Infectivity of the inoculum was controlled after challenge (3.8 \u00d7 10 3 PFU/ml, when tested 6 h after experimental infection). (Table 1) Twenty-four Normandy \u00d7 Holstein breed male calves were selected at birth, reared in isolation unit (A2 level of bio safety, INRA Experimental Platform of Infectiology, Nouzilly, France) from birth to euthanasia and allocated to specific units, according to experimental groups. Animals were housed in biocontainment facilities as prescribed by the guidelines of the European Community Council on Animal Care (86/609/CEE) and under the authority of licence issued by the Direction des Services V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires (accreditation number . Calves were colostrum deprived until 3 days after birth and then received a substitute of colostrum (CER Marloie, Belgium) by oral route for 4 days to protect them against enteritic pathogens. They were fed with commercial milk for first age (Sanders Ouest SAS, Champagne, France). Antibiotics (1 mg/kg cefquinome, Cobactan, Scherring-Plough Intervet, France) were administrated from birth to 7 days. Absence of maternal antibodies against BRSV was confirmed by IgG detection (indirect BRSV ELISA, LSI, Lissieu, France) in blood of calves at 7 days after birth. BRSV ELISA was also performed each week before inoculation, to rule out natural BRSV infection during rearing. Absence of BVDV in calves was assessed at birth and one week before challenge by negative detection of the BVDV p80-125 antigen (Serelisa BVDV-BD, Synbiotics, Lyon, France) and by negative RT-PCR [25] . All calves remained healthy during the 3-month period before challenge. At the end of the experiment all calves were found seronegatives for bovine parainfluenza type 3.\n\nCalves were randomly allocated in three groups. They were 1-month-old \u00b110 days at day of vaccination (considered as day 0). The first group (8 calves) was vaccinated twice at 3 weeks interval with 2 mg of N SRS protein with Montanide TM ISA71 VG adjuvant by the intramuscular route (2 ml, left flank). The second group (8 calves) received twice at 3 weeks interval 2 mg of N SRS protein with Montanide TM ISA71 VG adjuvant by the intramuscular route (2 ml, left flank) and 10 mg of N SRS protein with Montanide TM IMS 4132 VG adjuvant by the intranasal route (1 ml per nostril, using a nebulizator device for medical use, MADgic700, Wolfe Tory Medical, Utah, USA). The doses of antigen were defined according to one preliminary experiment done in calf to test the safety and immunogenicity of the N SRS /adjuvant formulations (not shown). The last group (8 calves) was untreated and served as negative control for the two vaccination regimen. Three weeks after the final vaccination, all calves were challenged with 10 5 PFU of the BRSV-3761 inoculum by intranasal nebulization (10 ml, tracherine IBR vaccine nebulizator) and intratracheal route (10 ml, Intraflon 2 catheter, Vycon, France). Two calves per group were euthanized under general anesthesia overdose (5 mg/kg ketamine followed by 15 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium) 6 days post-challenge (day 48), the remaining being euthanized 20 days post-challenge (day 62).\n\nCalves were observed for clinical signs of respiratory tract disease from 3 days prior infection to 20 days post-infection. Clinical assessments were made at the same time twice a day by the same veterinarian. Calves were examined for body temperature, nasal discharge, coughing, decrease appetite, general state, abnormal breathing, respiratory rate and abnormal lung sounds. Clinical scores were done for each calf as already described [26] with slight modifications. Rectal temperatures and respiratory frequencies were evaluated separately. Scores for respiratory rates (RR/min) were 0 (RR < 35), 1 (35 < RR < 45), 2 (45 < RR < 60) and 4 (RR > 60). A score between 0 (normal), 1 (mild) or 2 (severe) was attributed for nasal discharge, coughing, decrease appetite, general state, dyspnoea, and abnormal lung sound parameters, respectively. A fold coefficient of 3, 1, 3, 2, 2, 3 and 3 was subsequently attributed for respiratory rate, nasal discharge, coughing, decrease appetite, general state, dyspnoea, and abnormal lung sound parameters, respectively. \n\nTo follow antigen-specific antibody responses, nasal swabs in PBS 0.1% Tween and anti-proteases (Complete Mini, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, USA) and blood samples were collected at days 0, 20, 41 and 62. To monitor virus detection after challenge, nasal swabs were collected daily from days 39 to 62 from each animal in 1 ml of RLT-buffer (Qiagen S.A., France) for real time RT-PCR or in 1 ml PBS buffer for commercial EIA assay (Speed \u00ae ReSpiVB BVT, La Seyne-sur-Mer, France).\n\nComplete necropsies of calves were performed immediately after euthanasia at days 48 and 62. Lymphatic nodes (prescapular, tracheo-bronchial and mediastinal) were dissected out and processed for subsequent T cell assays. Lung macroscopic lesions were recorded on a standard lung diagram and expressed as % pneumonic consolidation of the cranial lobes (photographs were taken). BAL was performed with 500 ml D-MEM supplemented with antibiotics. After cell numeration, 2 \u00d7 10 5 BAL cells were cyto-centrifuged (Cytospin 4, Shandon, Thermo Scientific, France) on Superfrost plus slides (SFPLUS-42, Milan, France) for May-Gr\u00fcnwald-Giemsa staining, and 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells were fixed in Cyto-Chex (Streck, NE, USA) for flow cytometry analysis. The left-over BAL cells were lysed in RLT-buffer (RNeasy Mini, Qiagen S.A., France) for RNA extraction. Microscopic analysis was performed on tissue samples from the right cranial lobes of lungs, fixed in formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, 4-m sectioned, deparaffinized and counterstained with hematoxylin/eosin/saffran, analyzed and photographed. Examination for bacterial infection was performed on the same tissue samples after Gram staining. Samples of cranial lobe of the lungs were also collected in RNAlater (Qiagen S.A., France) for subsequent BRSV quantification by real time RT-PCR.\n\nVirus shedding in nasal swabs was quantitatively determined by a real time RT-PCR assay according to Boxus et al. [27] except that quantitative analysis of BRSV RNA was performed relative to the bovine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expressed housekeeping gene [28] . The same RT-PCR was used for quantification of BRSV in BAL and lung tissues.\n\nParaffin-embedded lung tissue sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated in Tris 0.05 M pH 7.4 with 0.2% CaCl 2 and then permeabilized with 0.02% Saponin (Sigma-Aldrich, France). BRSV antigens were detected using MoAb IgG2b anti RSV-F (clone B016, AbD Serotec, Germany) diluted 1:100 in Tris 0.05 M pH 7.4, 0.2% CaCl 2 and 0.02% Saponin. An irrelevant isotypematched mouse Ab was used as a control for non-specific staining. Binding of primary Ab was revealed by adding HRPconjugated anti-mouse IgG followed by the insoluble peroxydase substrate 3,3 -Diaminobenzidine (SigmaFast TM , Sigma-Aldrich, France). The tissue sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin.\n\nOne million BAL cells were incubated for 20 min in RPMI containing 10% horse serum (RPMI-HS) on ice. BAL cells were then stained for 30 min on ice with mouse MoAbs anti-bovine CD4 (IgG2a, clone ILA11, VMRD, WA, USA), CD8 (IgM, clone BAQ111A, VMRD, WA, USA) and CD45RO (IgG3, clone ILA116, VMRD, WA, USA), or matching isotype control mouse antibodies, all diluted 1:500 in RPMI-HS. BAL cells were washed and then incubated for another 30 min with anti-isotype antibodies conjugated to fluorochromes (FITC anti-IgG3, PE anti-IgG2a, Cy5 anti-IgM, Invitrogen Life Science, France). Cells were then fixed in 10% CellFIX (BD Biosciences, France). All samples were analyzed on a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences, France) collecting data on at least 20,000 lymphocytes gated according to their forward and side scatter features.\n\nLymph nodes were mechanically disrupted for cell dissociation in sterile RPMI-1640 medium plus 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 4 \u2022 C. The recovered cells were filtered through a sterile 100 m cell strainer (BD Biosciences, France) and washed twice in RPMI-1640 medium plus 10% FCS. PBMC and lymph node cells were finally suspended in X-vivo 15 medium (BioWhittaker, Lonza, Switzerland) supplemented with 1% FCS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/ml Penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml Streptomycin and cultivated in vitro for T cell proliferation or IFN-\u2425 detection assays.\n\nProliferation assays were carried out in 96-well flat-bottomed plates. Isolated lymph node cells were seeded in triplicate at 3 \u00d7 10 5 cells per well with or without N SRS (10 g/ml final concentration). Plates were incubated at 37 \u2022 C in 5% CO 2 for 96 h, then pulsed overnight with 1 Ci [ 3 H]-thymidine per well. Cells were then collected on filter mats using a cell harvester (Filtermate, PerkinElmer, France) and radioactivity was measured in a liquid scintillation luminescence counter (MicroBeta TriLux, Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Results were expressed as stimulation indexes (cpm of stimulated cells over cpm of unstimulated control cells).\n\nLymph node cells were plated in 96-well plates (Falcon 3072) in triplicates at 3 \u00d7 10 5 cells per well and incubated at 37 \u2022 C, in 5% CO 2 , with or without N SRS (10 g/ml final concentration). Supernatants were harvested at 72 h and the IFN-\u2425 content was tested using a specific ELISA test (Bovigam, Biocor, Melbourne, Australia), according to manufacturer's instructions. Results were expressed as stimulation indexes (OD 450 nm of N SRS -stimulated cells over OD of unstimulated control cells).\n\nIndividual sera and nasal secretions were assayed for Nspecific antibodies (total Ig, IgG1 and IgA) by ELISA. Microtiter plates (Immulon 2HB, Thermo Labsystems, France) were coated overnight at 4 \u2022 C with N antigen (200 ng per well in 100 l carbonate-bicarbonate buffer 0.1 M, pH 9.5). Plates were washed five times with PBS 0.05% Tween 20 between each step of the assay. After coating, the remaining protein binding sites were saturated with 5% horse serum in PBS 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T-HS) for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C. Samples were serially diluted threefold in PBS-T-HS starting at 1:30 for sera and 1:3 for nasal secretions and incubated for 2 h at 37 \u2022 C. Antigen-bound Abs were detected using HRP-conjugated anti-bovine Ig(H + L), HRP-conjugated sheep antibovine IgG1 or rabbit anti-bovine IgA (AbD Serotec, Germany) diluted 1:1000, incubated for 1 h at 37 \u2022 C, followed when required by an incubation with goat anti-rabbit Ig HRP-conjugated. The TMB substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc., MD, USA) was added and the reaction was stopped after 10 min by 1 M phosphoric acid. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm with an ELISA plate reader (MRX Revelation, Dynex Technologies, Germany). The results were expressed as endpoint antibody titers calculated by regression analysis plotting dilution versus A 450 (regression curve y = (b + cx)/(1 + ax) using Origin software). Endpoint titers were calculated as the highest dilution giving twice the absorbance of negative control sample.\n\nAlternatively, plates were coated with a lysate from BRSVinfected or mock-infected Turbinate cells in PBS. Lysate was obtained by treating the BRSV-infected or mock-infected Turbinate cells with 1% n-Octyl glucoside (Sigma-Aldrich, France) and 5 mM EDTA in 10 mM, pH 7.6 Tris saline buffer. Serum samples were diluted 1:270 and incubated on alternate rows with BRSV-infected and mock-infected Turbinate lysates, and the ELISA was performed as described above. To measure anti-BRSV-specific binding, background antibody binding to control lysate was substracted from binding to BRSV-infected cell lysate.\n\nAll data were expressed as arithmetic mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis on immune parameters was performed using non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test (http://elegans.swmed.edu/\u223cleon/stats/utest.html). Levels of significance are indicated on the graphs with stars: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.\n\nPeak clinical signs and viral load values were compared by oneway analysis of variance. Logarithmic transformation was applied to fulfill the conditions of variances in homogeneity and normality when necessary. A three-factor split-plot ANOVA test was used to calculate the effect of the factors 'day' and 'vaccination' between groups. For significant results, a Bonferroni's test among contrast was then used to compare the two conditions at each day postchallenge.\n\n3.1. Nano-rings were obtained with N from HRSV Long strain, formulated with Montanide TM adjuvants and tested for their immunogenicity\n\nWe have previously shown that soluble RNA-nucleoprotein complexes forming nano-rings (N SRS ) can be purified from bacteria expressing recombinant N and the C-terminal region (residues 161-241) of P protein (PCT) from the HRSV Long strain [20] . The same protocol was used in order to purify BRSV N proteins. The BRSV N protein was co-expressed with PCT from either HRSV or BRSV origin. As shown Fig. 1a , the BRSV N protein (strain A2Gelfi) was only recovered in the unsoluble fraction of bacterial lysates, and attempts to purify it by co-expression with GST-PCT were unsuccessful, either using PCT from BRSV or HRSV origin. On the other hand, the HRSV N protein was soluble and efficiently purified by BRSV PCT fused to GST (Fig. 1a) .\n\nThe N proteins of human strain Long and bovine strain 3761 are highly conserved since they share 93.6% of sequence amino acid identity and 99.2% of amino acid sequence similarity (Fig. 1b) . Thus we used the N SRS nano-rings derived from the HRSV Long strain as a vaccine candidate against BRSV infection. To control that N SRS were not degraded after emulsification with Montanide TM ISA71 VG or Montanide TM IMS4132 VG, the proteins present in the two formulations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE native gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy as described previously [20] . In both cases, the N protein was recovered as SRS (data not shown).\n\nIntramuscular injection is the classical way to vaccinate bovine. Our previous data in mice showed that nasal vaccination with the nano-rings N SRS was the most efficient immunization route for preventing HRSV replication in lung [22] . Thus we decided to administer the N SRS vaccine via both intramuscular and intranasal route at the same time (group N SRS i.m. + i.n.) and test the benefit of nasal vaccination by comparison with a group of calves receiving the vaccine by intramuscular injection only (group N SRS i.m.). All calves were vaccinated twice at 3 weeks interval. A third group of calves was left untreated (group \"no vaccine\"). No adverse clinical reactions were observed after the first or second immunizations.\n\nTo monitor the immunogenicity of the vaccine regimen, Nspecific antibodies were investigated in serum samples and nasal secretions (Fig. 2 ). Calves vaccinated with N SRS either i.m. or i.m. + i.n. displayed anti-N Ab in serum and in nasal secretions, detectable after the first immunization and increasing after the booster immunization ( Fig. 2a and b) . Anti-N Ab titers were not different between the two vaccinated groups. The nasal anti-N Ab response was of IgG1 isotype (Fig. 2c) , with lower anti-N IgA titers arising mostly after the booster immunization (Fig. 2d) . Nasal anti-N Ab titers were higher in the group N SRS i.m. + i.n. compared to N SRS i.m. (p < 0.05 for Ig titers and p < 0.01 for IgA titers, at day 41). Non-vaccinated control calves had significant anti-N Ab titers in blood and nasal secretion only after viral challenge ( Fig. 2a and b, p < 0.01 between days 0-41 and day 62, Ig titers in the no vaccine group). The antibodies elicited upon N SRS vaccination were also able to recognize the native viral N as shown by their specific binding to BRSV-infected Turbinate cells as antigen (OD \u00d7100 at day 41 were 22 \u00b1 10, 287 \u00b1 64 and 188 \u00b1 41, for groups no vaccine, N SRS i.m. and N SRS i.m. + i.n., respectively, p < 0.01 between vaccinated and non-vaccinated calves).\n\nAfter challenge, all calves showed mild clinical signs of upper respiratory tract infection that were essentially characterized by slight mucous nasal discharge, except for one calf of group N SRS i.m. which remained healthy. Cough was observed in two non-vaccinated calves for 2-3 days. Moderate hyperthermia was observed in all calves with no statistical differences between the 3 groups (data not shown). Respiratory signs consisted of moderate to high increased respiratory rates and mild dyspnoea with increasing lung sounds. Dyspnoea was also associated with wheezes and crackles in some calves. Among the 6 calves of the non-vaccinated control group, one calf was slightly affected, 4 calves were moderately ill and one calf developed a marked dyspnoea, with abnormal breathing, discordance, surrounding lung sounds of the cranial lobe, wheezes and crackles. For the six calves of group N SRS i.m., one calf showed no clinical signs, 2 calves developed very mild respiratory symptoms and 3 calves developed a moderate dyspnoea. Finally, 3 calves of the group N SRS i.m. + i.n. developed very mild respiratory signs and the other 3 showed a moderate dyspnoea. The mean clinical scores are shown in Fig. 3 . Statistical analyses (three-factor split-plot ANOVA test) indicated group and time effects between the non-vaccinated group and the groups N SRS i.m. or N SRS i.m. + i.n. No differences were found between the two vaccinated groups (N SRS i.m. and N SRS i.m. + i.n.). Significant reduction of mean clinical scores (Bonferroni's test among contrast, p < 0.05) was found for the group N SRS i.m. at days 5 and 6, for the group N SRS i.m. + i.n. at days 5-7 post-infection when compared to the non-vaccinated group (Fig. 3) . Onset, peak and duration of clinical scores were calculated for each group (Table 2) , showing delayed onset, peak and shorter duration of clinical symptoms in the two vaccinated groups. Thus the calves vaccinated with N SRS , either i.m. only or i.m. + i.n., Fig. 3 . Clinical scores following BRSV challenge. Respiratory rhythm, anorexia, presence of nasal discharge, lung sounds, cough and demeanour were recorded daily after challenge and clinical scores were calculated. Data represent means \u00b1 SEM (n = 6) in each group from day 0 (challenge) to day 19 after challenge. Stars indicate significant differences between the two vaccinated group (N SRS i.m. and i.m. + i.n.) and the non-vaccinated one.\n\nwere partly protected against the respiratory disease caused by virus challenge.\n\nTwo out of 8 calves of each group were euthanized on day 6 after challenge. The lungs were examined and the extent of macroscopic lesions was recorded. For all animals gross lesions were restricted to the cranial lobes except for one non-vaccinated calf showing lesions also in the middle and accessory lobes. Some patchy areas were atelectasic, collapsed, deep red and rubbery in texture. Extension of the lung lesions of calves is detailed in Table 2 for the right and the left cranial lobes respectively. To summarize, the extension of consolidation lesions varied between 10% (Fig. 4a , right cranial lobe) and 20% for unvaccinated calves while it was estimated to be 5% for the vaccinated calves (Fig. 4b , right cranial lobe). No macroscopic lesions were found for calves euthanized on day 20 post-challenge.\n\nHistological examination of lung tissue sections (sample from right cranial lobe, taken at the site of macroscopic lesions) revealed typical bronchointerstitial pneumonia (Fig. 4c and e) characterized by necrotizing bronchiolitis, formation of bronchiolar epithelial syncitia and proliferative alveolitis in 2 calves from the nonvaccinated group. In contrast, lung tissue sections from 3 out of 4 vaccinated calves (2/2 N SRS i.m. + i.n. and 1/2 N SRS i.m.) showed limited cellular infiltration in the peribronchiolar and bronchiolar areas, with minimal densification of the alveolar areas (shown of one N SRS i.m. + i.n. calve, Fig. 4d) . Besides, most of the bronchiolar lumina were clear of cellular debris (Fig. 4f) . The presence of BRSVinfected cells was revealed by immunostaining on the same lung tissue sections. BRSV-specific staining was found in the epithelial cells of the bronchioles from either vaccinated or non-vaccinated calves ( Fig. 4g and h, brown staining) .\n\nThe replication of BRSV in the respiratory tract of infected calves was further investigated by real time RT-PCR on BAL cells and (a and b) . Lung pieces were sampled in the right cranial lobe at the border between red atelectatic collapsed pulmonary areas and healthy tissue, fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Histological examination of sections counterstained with hematoxylin/eosin/saffran showed areas of bronchointerstitial pneumonia with proliferative alveolitis in non-vaccinated calves. This marked infiltration of inflammatory cells was observed in the alveolar, peribronchiolar and bronchiolar areas (c) and was associated to a necrotizing bronchiolitis (e). Bronchiolar lumen contained sloughed necrotic epithelial cells and sometimes multinucleate syncytial cells closely associated with the bronchiolar epithelium, and few inflammatory cells infiltrating the bronchiolar epithelium. Similar sections in vaccinated calves showed alveolar functional areas with minimal thickening of alveolar septa (d) and bronchiolar lumen clear of cellular debris (f). The same lung tissue sections were stained for BRSV antigens with an anti-F monoclonal antibody (brown staining) and counterstained with hematoxylin (pale blue staining). The control immunohistochemical reaction with an isotype-matched irrelevant mouse IgG was negative (data not shown). Immunohistochemical staining of BRSV-F revealed virusinfected bronchiolar epithelial cells (g and h) with viral antigens among the necrotic cells sloughed the bronchiole lumen (g). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of the article.) lung samples (right cranial lobe). At day 6 post-infection, viral RNA was detected in BAL cells and lung tissue of the two euthanized calves of each group with no significant differences between groups (Fig. 5a) . These data are in agreement with the finding of BRSVinfected cells in lung tissue sections by immunostaining. No virus could be detected at day 20 post-infection in BAL and lung of any calves.\n\nThe kinetic and amount of virus shedding was monitored in nasal secretions on a daily basis post-challenge. BRSV RNA was detected in nasal secretions of all infected calves (Fig. 5b and c) with BRSV RNA detection and viral load following challenge. The viral loads were examined by performing quantitative real time RT-PCR on total RNA extracted from BAL cells and lung pieces collected on two calves per group euthanized on day 6 after challenge (a) and from the nasal swabs sampled daily from the day of challenge up to 19 days after (b and c). Viral load is expressed as the log of BRSV copies per 10 7 GAPDH cDNA (mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 6). Stars indicate significant differences between the two vaccinated group (N SRS i.m. and i.m. + i.n.) and the non-vaccinated one. The daily percentage of positive calves per group is shown (c). a peak of virus shedding at day 5 post-challenge (10 3.6\u00b11 , 10 2.9\u00b10.7 and 10 3.8\u00b11.2 copies/10 7 copies of GAPDH for groups no vaccine, N SRS i.m., and N SRS i.m. + i.n., respectively). No significant differences were found between the two vaccinated groups. However, statistical analyses (three-factor split-plot ANOVA test) indicated group and time differences between the two vaccinated groups and the non-vaccinated group. Lower amounts of viral RNA were found in group N SRS i.m. at days 4 (p = 0.06) and 11 (p < 0.05) and in group N SRS i.m. + i.n. at days 2, 3 and 11 (p < 0.05, Fig. 5b) . Importantly the duration of viral excretion in nasal swabs was reduced in the vaccinated groups, BRSV being detected in swabs from days 1 to 17 post-infection in non-vaccinated calves versus days 1-8 in group N SRS i.m., and days 1-11 in group N SRS i.m. + i.n. (Fig. 5c ). In addition, the detection of BRSV proteins in nasal secretions by EIA assay on five calves of each group at days \u22121, 0, 2 to 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 postinfection showed that less calves were found positives on a daily Fig. 6 . Cell subsets recruited to the BAL following BRSV infection. Two calves per group were euthanized 6 days after BRSV challenge and the other calves were euthanized 20 days after challenge. Lungs were dissected out of the thoracic cage and lavaged with 500 ml of medium. The cells present in BAL were collected by cyto-centrifugation. The cellular composition of the BAL was established after May-Gr\u00fcnwald-Giemsa coloration and numeration of macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils (a). BAL cells were labeled with anti-CD45RO, CD4 and CD8 antibodies and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine which T lymphocyte subsets were recruited to the lung upon infection (b). 200,000 events were acquired, gated on lymphocytes according to FSC/SSC and CD45RO + criteria (at least 5000 events were gated). Data are mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 2 at day 6 and n = 6 at day 20. basis in the two vaccinated groups compared to the non-vaccinated group (data not shown).\n\nRespiratory infection is usually accompanied by an influx of lymphocytes and granulocytes into the lungs. BAL cells were collected from calves euthanized on days 6 (n = 2) and 20 (n = 6) after challenge and the percentages of macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils were determined after May-Gr\u00fcnwald-Giemsa staining. Six days after infection, we observed neutrophils in all BAL whether or not the calves had been vaccinated (18 \u00b1 4%, n = 6, Fig. 6a, black bars) . Twenty days postchallenge, the percentages of neutrophils in BAL ranged between 0.1 and 2.5%, without any significant differences between the three groups (no vaccine, N SRS i.m. and N SRS i.m. + i.n.). No eosinophils were found in BAL at 6 and 20 days post-challenge (Fig. 6a) .\n\nTo get an insight into the pattern of T cell responses in the lung upon challenge, CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes in BAL were monitored by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 6b) . Lymphocytes were gated according to their low FSC/SSC features and memory/activated lymphocytes were subsequently gated on the basis of CD45RO expression. The proportion of CD4 + and CD8 + cells within gated CD45RO + lymphocytes was determined. For the non-vaccinated calves experiencing a primary BRSV infection, CD8 + effector lymphocytes were found rapidly and more abundantly than their CD4 + counterpart into the airways (Fig. 6b, day 6) . The same pattern of T cell subsets on day 6 post-challenge (% CD8 + > CD4 + mem- ory/effector cells) was observed for the N SRS i.m. vaccinated calves whereas calves from the group vaccinated with N SRS i.m. + i.n. tended to have more memory/effector CD4 + than CD8 + T cells into their airways. By day 20 post-challenge, CD45RO + CD4 + and CDR45RO + CD8 + T cells were found in same proportion among BAL cells without significant differences between groups.\n\nIn primary BRSV infection of calves, N is a known target of cellmediated immunity [29] . Thus we tested whether N SRS vaccination had primed memory T cells responses that could be revealed postchallenge. Leukocytes were isolated from lymph nodes on day 20 post-BRSV challenge and then restimulated in vitro with N SRS . Nspecific cellular responses were measured by proliferation index based on tritiated thymidine incorporation (Fig. 7a) . To get insight into the function of T lymphocytes elicited upon N SRS immunization and BRSV challenge, their capacity to make IFN-\u2425 was assessed by ELISA in lymph node cell culture supernatant (Fig. 7b) .\n\nN-specific T cell responses were primed in the prescapular lymph node draining the site of i.m. vaccination with N SRS . Only N SRS vaccinated calves displayed a N-specific proliferative response (stimulation index of 4.2 \u00b1 1.4 and of 3.4 \u00b1 0.7, N SRS i.m. and N SRS i.m. + i.n. respectively, versus 1.1 \u00b1 0.1 for non-vaccinated calves, p < 0.05). Accordingly the capacity of T cells isolated from the prescapular LN to make IFN-\u2425 was significantly higher in the vaccinated calves than in the non-vaccinated one (p < 0.05% between no vaccine and N SRS i.m.).\n\nCells isolated from the lymph nodes draining the upper airways (tracheo-bronchial LN) and the lung (mediastinal LN) proliferated in response to N SRS and the mean proliferation index of the two vaccinated groups was not different from the non-vaccinated group, suggesting a T cell priming mainly due to BRSV infection. However when T cell memory responses were monitored by IFN-\u2425 production in tracheo-bronchial LN, the vaccinated calves had higher responses than the non-vaccinated one (p < 0.05% between no vaccine and N SRS i.m. + i.n.). The strongest IFN-\u2425 production was recorded in the mediastinal LN and tended to be higher for T cells isolated from vaccinated calves (SI of 1.4 \u00b1 0.2, 2.7 \u00b1 0.6 and 2.4 \u00b1 0.5 for no vaccine, N SRS i.m. and N SRS i.m. + i.n. respectively, p = 0.07 between no vaccine and N SRS i.m. and p = 0.06 between no vaccine and N SRS i.m. + i.n.). Thus the IFN-\u2425 response in the lymph nodes draining the airways was suggestive of memory T cells primed by N SRS vaccination and boosted upon BRSV challenge.\n\nNo RSV vaccine is yet licensed for human use and the inactivated or attenuated vaccines commercialized for bovine have a limited efficacy and a short duration of protective immunity. Difficulties of RSV vaccine development include the lack of a relevant animal model for human, the need to immunize immunologically immature young infants or calves with maternal RSV antibodies, the impact of RSV variability on vaccination and the risk of vaccineassociated disease enhancement. We were the first to publish an efficient and safe vaccination strategy against RSV using the nucleocapsid protein alone as a vaccine antigen, under the form of soluble nanoparticles referred to as N SRS [22] . In this previous study done in mice we have demonstrated that N SRS is highly immunogenic when delivered via the nasal route and that the immune response primed upon vaccination is protective against an HRSV challenge [22] . In the present study, we investigated the potency of N SRS as a vaccine in calves that are the natural hosts for BRSV and display clinical respiratory symptoms and lung lesions upon infection.\n\nOur findings indicate that calves vaccinated with N SRS were partially protected against the respiratory disease caused by a virus challenge. Significantly lower clinical scores were observed for two to three days in the vaccinated calves compared to the nonvaccinated calves and the duration of clinical signs was reduced in the vaccinated calves. At the precise site of virus-induced lesions, in the cranial lobe of the lungs, the vaccination with N SRS reduced the extent of local inflammatory consolidation. The vaccination with N SRS reduced the duration of viral shedding and the frequency of virus-secreting calves on a daily basis but it did not prevent viral shedding in nasal secretion, nor viral replication in lung. There was no difference between the two vaccination regimen (i.m. only or i.m. + i.n.) for their capacity to reduce clinical scores and viral load.\n\nImportantly the degree of protection conferred by vaccination with N SRS was not associated with markers of disease exacerbation (like eosinophilia) as is reported when vaccinating calves with FI-BRSV or live-BRSV [6] . Indeed no eosinophils and very few neutrophils were found in broncho-alveolar lavages of calves autopsied 3 weeks after challenge.\n\nSeveral points of discussion could explain the partial protection of calves by vaccination with N SRS , whatever the protocol used.\n\nClear respiratory symptoms and lung lesions were induced upon BRSV challenge but they were not severe. As frequently published with BRSV challenge models [30] [31] [32] , it is difficult to reproduce the severe clinical signs or lesions observed upon natural infections.\n\nIn calves normally bred in farms and not in isolation units like in the present study, bacterial or virus co-infections complicate the classical BRSV disease. The bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3), which is widespread in 2-8-month-old cattle, reduces pulmonary defences [33, 34] and thus may enhance the severity of the BRSV pathogenicity. Both viruses, BRSV and BPIV-3, are important predisposing factors in the development of bacterial bronchopneumonia in cattle. In addition intrinsic host parameters seem to control the severity of the disease since severe pathology is associated with dysfunctions of the host's response [8] . In this study, we used a BRSV 3761 inoculum which was previously shown successful in reproducing severe respiratory signs after intranasal and intratracheal injections of 1 and 3-month-old Prim'Holstein calves (G. Meyer, unpublished results; [18] ). This inoculum contained BRSV with few passages in cell cultures and with 3 cycles of amplification in newborn calves, a condition also shown by others to induce severe respiratory disease in calves [35, 36] . By comparison with previous successful experiments, failure to reproduce respiratory distress syndrome in this study could be related to host intrinsic parameters. Indeed, another study, using the same inoculum and crossed Prim'Holstein/Normandy calves of same origin, also failed to reproduce respiratory distress [19] .\n\nThe nucleoprotein subunits (N SRS ) used in this study were from HRSV origin. The gene encoding the nucleoprotein is shown to be one of the most conserved between BRSV and HRSV with an average of \u224894% amino acid identity. The nucleoprotein from BRSV is recognized by bovine CD8+ T cells but the precise CTL epitopes have not been defined yet [29] . In human, HLA-B07, HLA-B08 and HLA-A02 restricted epitopes were mapped in the nucleoprotein [12, 14] and interestingly their amino acid sequence is fully conserved among various HRSV field isolates and with BRSV strains [14] . The mechanisms of CTL cross-reactivity have been recently investigated with well-characterized CTL epitopes from HIV showing that biochemically similar amino acid substitutions do not drastically affect recognition by TCR [37] . Some level of cross-protection between HRSV and BRSV has been demonstrated in the cotton rat model in which BRSV was tested as a possible Jennerian vaccine against HRSV [38] . Among the viral antigens that may be cross protective between BRSV and HRSV, the BRSV-F (81% amino acid identity with HRSV-F), delivered as DNA vaccine, was shown to protect mice against an HRSV challenge [39] . The present study brings new data to support the hypothesis of common B or T epitopes between BRSV and HRSV nucleoproteins. Indeed, in our study, primary BRSV infection resulted in antibody and cellular immunity that could be revealed with an N SRS coated ELISA assay or following an in vitro boost with N SRS , respectively. Conversely serum Ab from N SRS vaccinated calves reacted against a BRSV-infected cell lysate. This indicates that recombinant N from HRSV origin assembling into nano-rings and the nucleocapsid protein N from BRSV strain 3761 displayed at least some common epitopes and that vaccination with N SRS from HRSV protein sequences provide significant cross-protection against BRSV challenge in calves.\n\nFinally, several parameters such as the dose of vaccine, the type of adjuvant and the route of administration may have influenced the degree of protection. The oil based adjuvants in our N SRS vaccine are from the Montanide TM range that are present in several veterinary vaccines used in the field to eradicate viral diseases (e.g. foot and mouth disease) in many countries and for decades. In the present study, we aimed at inducing a strong cellular response therefore we selected a dedicated mineral oil based adjuvant for intramuscular vaccination (ISA 71 VG). For intranasal vaccination we selected one adjuvant from the Montanide TM IMS technology (IMS 4132 VG) that has physical properties (flow-ability, viscosity) permitting an easy delivery in animal nostril.\n\nThe intramuscular route is a classical way of injection for inactivated vaccines. As it is true for live virus, intranasal vaccination with live-BRSV or modified-live-BRSV vaccine has been shown to be more efficacious in reducing viral shedding than intramuscular administration in young calves [40, 41] . Moreover, a single intranasal vaccination has previously been shown to prime calves in the face of maternal antibodies [41] . Commercially available modified-live-BRSV vaccines that were formulated and licensed for parenteral use were shown to induce partial protection when administered intranasally [42] . Recently a single intranasal dose of a bivalent modified-live vaccine was shown to reduce nasal shedding of BRSV after challenge at 10 or 21 days post-vaccination, despite low BRSV neutralizing antibody titers detected after vaccination [32] .\n\nThus we have chosen the two vaccination regimen used in the present study based on the hypothesis that administration of N SRS via the nasal route would strengthen any level of protection conferred by the intramuscular vaccination. However no differences in clinical and viral protection were observed between calves vaccinated intramuscularly only, versus intramuscularly plus intranasally. This could be explained by a weak response to the intranasal vaccination or a masking of the immune response induced after intranasal vaccination by those obtained after intramuscular vaccination. Unfortunately, due to a restricted number of BRSV seronegative calves, it was not possible to have a supplementary group of calves vaccinated only by the intranasal route.\n\nBy itself, the intramuscular administration of N SRS powerfully stimulated mucosal and systemic Ab responses and cellular immunity. The intranasal administration of N SRS given with the i.m. immunization increased some immune responses at the level of the upper respiratory tract: memory T cells producing IFN-\u2425 in tracheo-bronchial lymph node and antigen-specific IgA in nasal secretion.\n\nThe expression of CD45RO is considered a reliable marker to monitor activated CD4 and CD8 T cells in bovine [43, 44] . In the context of primary infection with BRSV, CD8 T cells are the predominant subset recruited to the airways [45] and prior vaccination with inactivated or live-attenuated virus can modify the pattern of T cell responses [46] . We had reported previously a preferential priming of CD4 responses following challenge with HRSV-A2 of mice vaccinated intranasally with N SRS [22] . Thus it is possible that the intranasal delivery of N SRS was responsible for the early presence of CD45RO + CD4 + T cell in bovine airways post-challenge of the i.m. + i.n. vaccinated calves.\n\nHowever, the nasal vaccination might not have been efficient enough to prime protective local anti-viral immunity. This could be related to the type of adjuvant used, the delivery device/route, the antigen itself. Additional studies will be necessary to improve intranasal vaccination with N SRS by testing several doses of antigen in association with adjuvants used for intranasal delivery and to compare results with those obtained after intramuscular vaccination.\n\nWhat are the immune correlates of the viral and clinical protection afforded by the N SRS vaccination?\n\nWe have shown in our previous study in mice that the antibodies raised against N were not neutralizing and thus unlikely to be involved in the anti-viral protection. Cellular immunity mediated by virus-specific CD8 T cells is required to clear BRSV from the lungs of infected calves in a primary infection [47, 48] and N is one of the main targets of CD8 + T cell responses to BRSV [29] .\n\nIn the present study we have shown that N SRS vaccination primed antigen-specific T cell memory responses, characterized by their capacity to proliferate and secrete IFN-\u2425. In other studies implying N SRS vaccination in mouse or lamb animal models we have shown that N-specific memory CD8 and CD4 T cell are primed ( [22] and S. Riffault unpublished results). Recently a vaccination regimen using the nucleoprotein in a DNA prime-protein boost protocol was shown to be superior to DNA or protein vaccination alone to prime antigen-specific CD8 memory T cells, to protect against BRSV replication and to reduce lung pathology [19] . However, because DNA vaccination is not authorized in human, the use of N protein alone for vaccination of newborn children could be an interesting alternative approach. Moreover N SRS can be produced in large amount in bacteria and their nanoring structure is very stable either at 4 \u2022 C or 20 \u2022 C (our unpublished observations), making their production and storage cheap and easy.\n\nSetting up the right conditions for cross-protective cellular immunity against conserved antigens is a growing challenge in the vaccinology field nowadays (e.g. universal Influenza vaccine). The nucleoprotein subunit approach described in the present study is efficient for inducing cross-protective immunity against RSV. Interestingly the N SRS structures are very potent at stimulating antibody responses both at the systemic and mucosal levels. We have recently obtained the X-ray 3D structure of the N SRS [21] and have been able to map exposed sites on the nano-rings to which other antigenic motifs can be grafted. Our next goal will be to improve the degree of protection by using RSV nucleocapsid nanoparticles grafted with peptidic epitopes from the BRSV fusion-(F) and glyco-(G) proteins in order to trigger neutralizing antibody responses in addition to anti-N cellular responses."}
