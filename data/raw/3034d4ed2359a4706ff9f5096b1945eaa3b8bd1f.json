{"title": "Preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care A rapid overview of reviews", "body": "The Infection Prevention & Control of the World Health Organization (WHO) Health Emergency Programme presented a query on preventing and managing COVID-19 in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care facilities including privately paid for and publicly paid for settings with a 5-business day timeline. According to the WHO, \"long-term care covers those activities undertaken by others to ensure that people with, or at risk of, a significant ongoing loss of intrinsic capacity can maintain a level of functional ability consistent with their basic rights, fundamental freedoms and human dignity\" (https://www.who.int/ageing/long-term-care/WHO-LTC-series-subsaharan-africa.pdf?ua=1). Examples of long-term care include nursing homes, charitable homes, municipal homes, long-term care hospitals, long-term care facilities, skilled nursing facilities, convalescent homes, and assisted living facilities (https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/home-continuing-care/long-term-facilitiesbased-care.html).\n\nThe overall objective of this rapid overview of reviews (overview hereafter) was to identify evidence on infection protection and control measures for adults aged 60 years and older in long-term care settings from systematic reviews. In order to focus the research question to increase feasibility, we proposed the following key research questions:\n\n1. What are the infection prevention and control practices/measures for preventing or reducing respiratory viruses (including coronavirus and influenza) in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care? 2. How do infection prevention and control practices differ for adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care with respiratory illness and severe comorbidities or frailty differ than those without such severe comorbidities/frailty? 3. How do infection prevention and control practices differ for adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care with respiratory illness from low-and middle-income economy countries (LMIC) differ than those living in high-income economy countries and do differences exist across different cultural contexts?\n\nThe rapid overview was guided by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 1 along with the Rapid Review Guide for Health Policy and Systems Research 2 . The team used an integrated knowledge translation approach, with consultation from the knowledge users from the WHO at the following stages: question development, interpretation of results, and draft report. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement 3 to guide the reporting of our rapid overview results; a PRISMA extension for rapid reviews and a reporting guideline on overviews are currently under development. This rapid overview was completed in conjunction with a rapid review of clinical practice guidelines published in a separate report titled: Guidelines for preventing respiratory illness in older adults aged 60 years and above living in long-term care: A rapid review of clinical practice guidelines.\n\n.

If publication in a peer-reviewed journal is planned in the future, we will register this rapid review with the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/).\n\nComprehensive literature searches addressing all research questions were developed by an experienced librarian for MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and biorxiv.org/medrxiv.org databases. Grey (i.e., difficult to locate or unpublished) literature was located using keyword searches of relevant terms (e.g. respiratory illness, MERS, coronavirus, SARS, long-term care facilities) in clinicaltrials.gov and GIDEON (Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Network). The full MEDLINE search strategy can be found in Appendix 2. Due to the rapid timelines for this overview, a peer review of the literature search was not conducted.\n\nThe Eligibility criteria followed the PICOST framework and consisted of:\n\nPopulation: Individuals aged 60 years and above residing in long-term care facilities. The age cut-off for an older adult might be 50 years and above in different LMIC and/or cultural settings. As such, we included these in level 1 screening of titles and abstracts and presented potentially relevant studies in an appendix.\n\nIntervention: Any form of infection control and prevention, such as hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene/etiquette, personal protective equipment (for patients and health care providers), triage (on arrival), source control, isolation, daily monitoring/surveillance for signs and symptoms of respiratory illness (e.g., in residence, environmental cleaning, cleaning of linen and medical equipment used by patients, restrictions on resident movement and transportation, restrictions on visitors, restrictions on travel for health care providers and other long-term care facility staff, waste management, dead body management. Only those measures used to prevent and control respiratory illnesses, including influenza and coronavirus (e.g., COVID-19, MERS, SARS) were included. Interventions focused on preventing bacterial respiratory outbreaks (e.g., strep, pneumonia, klebsiella) or aspiration pneumonia were excluded. Interventions specifically focused on vaccination were excluded, as a vaccine for the coronavirus currently does not exist.\n\nComparator: One of the interventions listed above or no intervention Outcomes: Lab-confirmed respiratory illness due to the virus (e.g., SARS, MERS, COVID-19, influenza) [primary outcome], secondary bacterial infection, symptoms, secondary transmission (e.g., other patients, healthcare workers, visitors), goal concordant care, hospitalization, intensive-care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality.\n\nStudy designs: We limited inclusion to systematic reviews using the Cochrane definition of a systematic review (https://www.cochrane.org/news/what-are-systematic-reviews).\n\nTime periods: All periods of time and duration of follow-up were eligible.\n\n.

Agreement between reviewers was sufficiently high (>75%) in both cases so no further pilot-testing was required. Full screening was completed by a single reviewer for both level 1 and level 2 using Synthesi.SR, the team's proprietary online software (https://breakthroughkt.ca/login.php).\n\nItems for data abstraction included characteristics (e.g., duration of follow-up, study design, country of conduct, multi-center vs. single site, long-term care setting characteristics, such as availability of medical support, characteristics of care staff, family/community engagement, accommodation characteristics, collective practices), patient characteristics (e.g., mean age, age range, co-morbidities), intervention details (e.g., type of intervention, duration and frequency of intervention, timing of intervention), comparator details (e.g., comparator intervention, duration and frequency of intervention, timing of intervention), and outcome results (e.g., lab-confirmed viral respiratory infection, symptoms, secondary transmission, hospitalization, ICU admission, mortality) at the longest duration of follow-up. A standardized data abstraction form was developed. Prior to data abstraction, a calibration exercise was completed to test the form amongst the entire review team using two randomly selected full-text systematic reviews. Following successful completion of the calibration exercise, included reviews were abstracted by single reviewers.\n\nRisk of bias appraisal was carried out by single reviewers using the AMSTAR-2 tool (https://amstar.ca/Amstar-2.php). The AMSTAR-2 tool includes 16 items, plus an overall risk of bias rating that ranges from low risk of bias to high risk of bias, with moderate risk of bias in between. The items focus on methods related to the research question, protocol, literature search, study selection, risk of bias appraisal, data abstraction, meta-analysis, and conflicts of interest.\n\nIncluded studies were synthesized descriptively including summary statistics and detailed tables of study characteristics and results. Tables of study results are organized according to study design and where available, information on relevant subgroups were highlighted.\n\nThe database search returned a total of 3,309 citations, while the grey literature searches returned 42 citations for level 1 screening. A total of 3,225 citations were excluded after level 1 .

Of the 126 articles screened at level 2, 6 systematic reviews were included ( Figure  1 ).\n\nThe six systematic reviews were published between 1999 and 2018 (Appendix 3). The number of studies included in the systematic reviews ranged from 1 to 37 (not reported in one systematic review). Only two systematic reviews reported the number of included patients, which ranged from 140 to 908. The systematic reviews included studies that were conducted in long-term care facilities and the interventions were pharmacological (e.g., antiviral chemoprophylaxis), non-pharmacological (e.g., increasing hand hygiene, personal protective equipment, social distancing), and a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological.\n\nThe six systematic reviews varied in their quality according to the AMSTAR-2 tool, with two being assessed as having a high risk of bias, one with a moderate risk of bias, and three with a low risk of bias ( Figure 2 , Appendix 4).\n\nCitations identified through database search (n = 3,309)\n\nCitations identified through other sources (n = 42)\n\nFull-text articles screened for eligibility (n=126) Systematic reviews included (n = 6)\n\nFull-text articles excluded (n = 120)\n\nDuplicates (n=3) Citations excluded (n = 3,225)\n\n.

One moderate quality SR with meta-analysis found a moderate non-statistically significant effect in favour of personal protective equipment (PPE) in preventing infection. The same SR and meta-analysis also examined the effectiveness of social isolation to prevent infection and found no statistically significant results. One moderate quality SR reported statically significant evidence for the effectiveness of amantadine and amantadine + PPE to prevent the spread of viral respiratory infections in long-term care facilities.\n\nManaging respiratory illness in long-term care facilities: Statistically significant results were found from one moderate and one high quality systematic review for the use of amantadine as antiviral chemoprophylaxis for individuals diagnosed with lab-confirmed influenza (Table 1 ). In addition, statistically significant results were found from one high quality systematic review for the use of amantadine plus personal protective equipment to prevent spread of infection from individuals diagnosed with lab-confirmed influenza. Statistically significant results were not observed in one moderate and one high quality systematic review regarding rimantadine or neuraminidase inhibitors as antiviral chemoprophylaxis. However, statistically significant results were observed in one low quality systematic review for rimantadine as antiviral chemoprophylaxis. Mixed evidence was identified from two low quality systematic reviews for zanamivir as antiviral chemoprophylaxis that reported non-statistically significant reductions in viral respiratory infection rates. The full systematic review results are available in Appendix 5.\n\n.

A comprehensive literature search of both electronic databases and grey literature sources resulted in six included systematic reviews, none of which specifically focused on issues related to residents with respiratory illness and severe comorbidities or frailty. Furthermore, none focused on issues in LMIC or different cultural contexts.\n\nOverall, the results of the included systematic reviews suggest that high quality evidence supports treating residents with antiviral chemoprophylaxis with adamantine, as well as adamantine in combination with personal protective equipment. For the rest of the strategies, there was either no evidence of effectiveness (e.g., social isolation) or mixed evidence of effectiveness (e.g., rimantadine, zanamivir, hand hygiene, personal protective equipment). The mixed evidence on hand hygiene and use of personal protective equipment does not imply these should not be used in outbreaks.\n\nThere are several limitations to the overview methods employed here, single screening and abstraction for example, however they were selected to thoughtfully tailor our methods according to our knowledge user needs and the urgent nature of the request to provide timely results.\n\n.
