{"title": "Comparative Genomic Analysis of Rapidly Evolving SARS CoV-2 Viruses Reveal Mosaic Pattern of Phylogeographical Distribution", "body": "Since the current outbreak of pandemic coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the assessment of biogeographical pattern of SARS-CoV-2 isolates and the mutations at nucleotide and protein level is of high interest to many research groups Wall et al., 2020; . Coronaviruses (CoVs), members of Coronaviridae family, order Nidovirales, have been known as human pathogens from last six decades (Tyrrell and Bynoe,1966) . Their target is not just limited to humans, but also to other mammals and birds (Woo et al., 2012) .\n\nCoronaviruses have been classified under alpha, beta, gamma and delta-coronavirus groups (Li, 2016) in which former two are known to infect mammals while latter two primarily infect bird species (Tang et al., 2015) . Illness in humans varies from common cold to respiratory and gastrointestinal distress of varying intensities. In the past, more severe forms caused major outbreaks that include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) ( Barcena et al., 2009 ). Their genome is nearly 27 to 31 Kb long, largest among the RNA viruses, with 5'cap and 3' polyA tail, for translation (Brian and Baric, 2005) . Their spherical capsid and spikes give them crown-like appearance due to which they were named as 'corona', meaning 'crown' or 'halo' in Latin.\n\nCoronavirus consists four main proteins, spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N). The spike (~150 kDa) mediates its attachment to host receptor proteins (Colins et al., 1982) . Membrane protein (~25-30 kDa) attaches with nucleocapsid and maintains curvature of virus membrane (Neumann et al., 2011) . E protein (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) is responsible for the pathogenesis of the virus as it eases assembly and release of virion particles and also has ion channel activity as integral membrane protein (Ruch and Machamer, 2012 \n\nSequences of different strains were downloaded from NCBI database https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/ (Table 1). A total of 97 genomes were   downloaded on March 19, 2020 and based on quality assessment two genomes with multiple Ns were removed from the study. Further the genomes were annotated using Prokka (Seemann, 2014 were predicted against the formatted database using prokka (-gcode 1) (Seemann, 2014) .\n\nFurther the GC content information were generated using QUAST standalone tool (Gurevich et al., 2013) .\n\nTo determine the evolutionary pressure on viral proteins, dN/dS values were calculated for 9\n\nORFs of all strains. \n\nIn order to infer the phylogeny, the core gene alignment was generated using MAFFT (Nakamura et al., 2018) present within the Roary Package (Page et al., 2015) . Further, the phylogeny was inferred using the Maximum Likelihood method based and Tamura-Nei model (Tamura and Nei, 1993) \n\nIn this study, we analysed a total of 95 SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated between December 2019-March 2020 from 11 different countries namely USA (n=52), China (n=30), Japan (n=3), India (n=2), Taiwan (n=2) and one each from Australia, Brazil, Italy, Nepal, South Korea and Sweden ( Figure 1 ). A total of 68 strains were isolated from either oronasopharynges or lungs, while two of them were isolated from faeces suggesting both respiratory and gastrointestinal connection of SARS-CoV-2 ( (helicase or Hel), nsp14 (3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease or ExoN), nsp15 and nsp16.\n\nOur analysis revealed that strains of human infecting SARS-CoV-2 are novel and highly identical (>99.9%). A recent study established the closest neighbour of SARS-CoV-2 as\n\nSARSr-CoV-RaTG13, a bat coronavirus (Gorbaleneya et al., 2020). As COVID19 transits from epidemic to pandemic due to extremely contagious nature of the SARS-CoV-2, it was interesting to draw the relation between strains and their geographical locations. In this study, we employed two methods to delineate phylogenomic relatedness of the isolates: core genome ( it is plausible for strains from other countries to show most similarity with strains from these two countries. In near future as more and more genome sequences will become available from different geographical locations, more accurate patterns of their relatedness across the globe will become available\n\nSNPs in all predicted ORFs in each genome were analysed using SARS-CoV-2/SH01/human/2020/CHN as a reference. SNPs were determined using maximum unique matches between the genomes of coronavirus, we observed that the strains isolated from USA \n\nAlthough the primary mode of infection is human to human transmission through close contact, which occurs via spraying of nasal droplets from the infected person, yet the primary site of infection and pathogenesis of SAR-CoV-2 is still not clear and under investigation. To explore the role of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in host immune evasion, the SARSCoV-2 proteins were mapped over host proteome database (Table 3) . We identified a total 28 proteins from host proteome forming close association with 25 viral proteins present in 9 ORFs of SARS-CoV-2\n\n( Figure 4C ). The network was trimmed in Cytoscape v3.7.2 where only interacting proteins were selected. Only 12 viral proteins were found to interact with host proteins ( Figure 4A ). during division. Thus, major viral assembly also targets the proteins linked with immunity and cell division. Taken together, we estimated that SARS-CoV-2 manipulate multiple host proteins for its own survival while, their interaction is also a reason for immunopathogenicity.\n\nAs COVID19 continues to impact virtually all human lives worldwide due to its extremely contagious nature, it has spiked the interest of scientific community all over the world to understand better the pathogenesis of the novel SARS-CoV-2. In this study, the analysis was . Therefore, we argue that the novel SARS-CoV-2 has fast evolving replicative machinery and that it is urgent to consider these mutants in order to develop strategies for COVID19 treatment. The ORF1ab polyprotein protein and Sprotein were also found to have dN/dS values approaching to 1 and thus might confer selective advantage to evade host responsive mechanisms. The construction of SARS-CoV-2-human interactome revealed that its pathogenicity is mediated by surge in pro-inflammatory cytokine.\n\nIt is predicted that major immune-pathogenicity mechanism by SARS-CoV-2 includes the host cell environment alteration by disintegration by signal transduction pathways and immunity evasion by several protection mechanisms. The mode of entry of this virus by S-proteins inside host cell is still unclear but it might be similar to SARS CoV-1 like viruses. Lastly, we believe that COVID-19 is being transmitted from human to human, but as more data accumulate the picture will be more clear, as these virus spread beyond the imagination of scientific community.
