{"title": "An Escherichia coli CS3lA fibrillum chimera capable of inducing memory antibodies in outbred mice following booster immunization with the entero-pathogenic coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus", "body": "22 November 1995; revised 26 June 1996; accepted 15 July 1996) The fibrillum CS31A is a plasmid-encoded heteropolymeric protein previously identified among animal and human enterotoxigenic or septicemic Escherichia coli strains'-'. Comparison of the amino acid (aa) sequences of the major subunit proteins from CS31Arelated fibrillae, namely K88 and F41, revealed a variable region in ClpG (aa 19 1-218) forming a flexible loo structure, as assessed by the topological model of ClpG B This region contains a hydrophilic domain and several accessible continuous immunodominant epitopes, one of which (aa 189-194) is exposed on the CS31A polymer (unpublished data). The aa 191-218 region of ClpG has been demonstrated to accept various small heterologous antigenic peptides without affecting fibrillae formatior?. All these features make this region interesting to presenting a foreign antigen as repeating units along the CS31A polymer.\n\nTransmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) , that belongs to the Coronaviridae family of enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses, causes gastroenteritis resulting in severe diarrhea, dehydration, high mortality and morbidity in piglets under 2 weeks of age6 by replicating selectively in the differentiated enterocytes covering the villi of the small intestine7. Coronavirions contain at least four structural proteins: the S spike glycoprotein (TGEV-S); the N nucleoprotein; the M membrane glycoprotein; and the sM protein. TGEV-S has been shown to mediate attachment of virions to the host cell receptor, to be involved in cell-to-cell fusion, to be the major inducer of TGEV neutralizing_Fntibodies (Abs), and to bear virulence determinants . Because transmissible gastroenteritis disease continues to cause major economic losses to the swine industry, and to date effective vaccines or treatments have remained elusive\", there is a demand for the development of a new type of vaccine against TGEV. Here we describe the exploitation of a carrier-expression system based on the CS31A fibrillae of E. coli'.\" for presenting two antigenic peptides from TGEV to the immune system.\n\nIn this paper we use recombinant DNA techniques to introduce in tandem the sites C (TGEV-C) (aa 363-371) and A (TGEV-A) (aa 521-531) of TGEV-S into the aa 202-218 part of ClpG. TGEV-C, recognized by the Mab 3b.5\", elicits neutralizing Abs'2.'3. TGEV-A, recognized by the Mab 1A.F1014, is part of an immunogenic conformational antigenic region that, in contrast to TGEV-C, is highly conserved among enteric and respiratory isolates as well as, between porcine, canine and feline coronaviruses 5, in pregnant sows16. and confers lactogenic protection In addition, this region consists of the major neutralizing site that also interacts with the TGEV receptor*. Therefore, it was hypothesized that adequate presentation to the immune system of pregnant sows of one or several epitopes from this region would provide a protective immune response against TGEV in piglets, and that these epitopes should be used as vaccine candidates16.\n\nThe present study shows that mice immunized with purified hybrid CS31A fibrillae developed a systemic Ab response reactive towards the free synthetic TGEV peptides, native TGEV particles and TGEV infectivity, indicating that C and A epitopes were immunogenic in the CS31A-associated conformation.\n\nIn addition, a memory Ab response against the CS31A-fused TGEV epitopes was elicited following booster inoculation with TGEV virions, making CS31A fibrillum a good vector candidate for recombinant vaccines design.\n\nThe E. coli K-12 strain used in this work was DHSa (BRL, Life Technologies, Inc.). Bacteria were grown at 37\u00b0C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or LB agar supplemented with tetracycline (12 ,ug ml-') or chlorampheni-co1 (30 pg ml-'). Plasmid pEH52417 ( Figure IA) the CS31A fibrillae-encoding clp gene cluster on the 8.5-kb EcoRI-Hind111 fragment in the low-copy number vector pHSG57518 containing pSClO1 replicon. The pEH524-determined clp gene cluster contains seven structural genes encoding all the secretory proteins required for CS31A biogenesis ( Figure IA) . They include the major ClpG subunit protein and several accessory proteins involved in the stabilization, transport and assembly of ClpG. The clpG gene codes for the ClpG precursor whose ,grocessing results in a mature polypeptide of 257 aa . To perform DNA manipulations in cZpG without affecting the rest of the operon, clpG and cZp helper-genes were cloned into two separate compatible plasmids ( Figure IB ). The first, pDSPH524l', contains the clp ene cluster with clpG deleted, and the second, !? pPSX83 , clpG only. Plasmid pDSPH524 was constructed by deleting the SphI-5'phI fragment from pEH524 and religating. Plasmid pPSX83 was made by cloning cZpG from pEH524 as a PstI-HpaI fragment dowstream of the Zac promoter in the PstI-SmaI sites of the high-copy number vector l&elect-l (Promega  Corporation) carrying ColEl replicon. In transcomplementation experiments, pDSPH524 and pPSX83 were co-selected on the basis of their chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance, respectively. The insertion vector pPSXlOS ( Figure 2b ) was constructed in two steps from pPSX83 after two consecutive rounds of oligonucleotide-directed site mutagenesis as previously described5, resulting in the creation of unique SpeI and BgflI sites in clpG ( Figure 2b ). The engineered spe1 and BgflI sites allow subsequent replacement of the aa 202-217 region of ClpG as described in Figure 2 .\n\nPlasmid DNAs were extracted by alkaline lysis and column-purified (Qiagen GmbH, Germany). DNA fragments obtained from digestion with restriction endonucleases were purified from agarose gels with \"Prep-Agene\" DNA purification kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories Ltd) before ligation. All other standard techniques were performed essentially as described\". Buffers, reaction conditions, restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes were used as recommended by the suppliers. DNA sequencing was performed on denatured doublestranded plasmid DNA with the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method2' using internal primers, [\"'S]dATP as the label and the USB Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit.\n\nThe oligonucleotides used in this study were synthesized and, when necessary, PAGE-purified and 5'phosphoryled (Eurogentec, Belgium). Synthetic peptides were obtained from Neosystem (Strasbourg, France) and their purity was 75% as determined by highperformance liquid chromatography.\n\nFor preparation of crude CS31A fibrillae extracts, bacteria grown overnight on LB agar with the appropriate antibiotics were carefully scraped and suspended in PBS (pH 7.2). This suspension was then vigorously agitated for 1 min with a top mix shaker, and placed at 60\u00b0C for 20 min (thermo-elution of CS31A polymer). After centrifugation at 12000g for 10 min, the supernatant containing the free fibrillar polymers was recovered for analysis. Purifications of native CS31A polymers and ClpG monomers were performed as previously described'.\n\nProduction of hybrid CS31A polymers was detected by in situ colony immunoblotting, Western immunoblotting following PAGE under native or denaturing conditions, and electron microscopy.\n\nCoIon_v blots analysis. Single colonies were streaked on a solid agar LB plate containing appropriate antibiotics. After overnight incubation at 37\"C, a nitrocellulose filter (pore diameter, 0.45 pm; Schleicher and Schuell) was carefully applied on agar surface. Blots were blocked and washed with 1% BSAO. 1% Tween 20 in PBS until the bulk of bacteria was remqved. The filters were incubated with appropriate primary Abs in PBS-l% BSA. Bound primary Abs were detected by incubation of the filters with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary Ab, and developed with H,O,-a-chloronaphtol.\n\nWestern blots analysis. Aliquots of either crude CS31A extracts, or purified CS31A polymers, or purified ClpG subunits mixed with an equal volume of 2 x incomplete Laemmli buffer were either boiled for 5 min or incubated at room temperature to obtain the monomeric and multimeric forms of the moteins. respectively. Samples PAGE and semi-dry cellulose'2. Western described above.\n\nwere applied to a _ 10-l 5Oi electro-transferred onto nitroblots were then treated as Electron microscopy analysis. Electron microscopy of purified CS31A fibrillae stained negatively with 1% phosphotungstic acid and of IO-nm colloidal gold immunolabelled intact CS31A on E. coli cells were carried out essentially as previously described'.\n\nClpG subunit-specific rabbit antiserum (anti-ClpG) and native CS3 1A polymer-specific rabbit antiserum (anti-CS31A) were obtained as previously described'. The Mabs 3b.5 and lA.FIO directed against the TGEV-C and -A epitopes of TGEV-S on native TGEV coronavirus, were described by Delmas et al. I2 and Gebauer et al. 14, respectively. \n\nThe outbred Swiss OF1 and inbred DBA/2 (H-2d), C57BL/6 (H-2b), CBA/J (H-zk), SJL (H-2\") mice 8-12 weeks of age used in this work for experimental immunization were purchased from IFFA-Credo (Les Oncins, France).\n\nFor the detection of Abs directed against the CS31A and ClpG carriers, 96-well microtitre trays (Falcon) were coated with form at 5 pg ml -P. urified CS31A protein on dissociated m 50 mM carbonate buffer (pH 9.6). For the detection of Abs directed against viral epitopes, highly activated 96-well microtitre plates Immulon II (Dynatech) were coated with synthetic peptides containing TGEV-C sequence (TVSDSSFFSYGEIPF) or TGEV-A sequence (SMKRSGYGQPIAG) at 20 pg ml-' in 50 mM carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) containing 10 mM dithiothreitol and incubated for 16 h at 4\u00b0C. Detection was achieved by incubation with 2-2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiasoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS) and 2 nM H,O, in phosphate-citrate buffer for 20 min in the dark at room temperature. ELISA assays were performed in duplicate and the reactive titre of each antiserum was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution which showed a twofold increase in optical density (O.D.) at 405 nm over that obtained with the negative control. Irrelevant peptides derived from capside protein VP1 of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) (51-RYKQKIIAPAQKGG-65) and from capside protein VP1 of poliovirus (91-YDNPASTTN KDKLFA-105) were used as negative controls in the peptide-specific ELISA.\n\nFor anti-TGEV particles titre determination, individual mouse sera were tested as follows: 96-well microtitre plates were coated overnight at 37\u00b0C with purified TGEV Purdue-115 virus23 at 5-10 pug ml-' in PBS, washed with TBS buffer (pH 8.1) and incubated with gelatin at 15 mg ml -' in TBS for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After washing in TBS-O.l% Tween 20, antiserum diluted in TBS-0.1% Tween 20 was added and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. After washing in TBS-0.1% Tween 20, bound Abs were detected by incubation with alkaline phosphataselabelled anti-mouse IgG conjugate in TBS-0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C then after washing, with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (PNPP) at 1 mg ml-' in diethanolamine buffer for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. The coloured reaction was stoped by 2 N NaOH. Anti-virus titres were expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution giving an O.D. 20.2 at 405 nm. A reference serum was included in each experiment. Negative controls were sera of mice hyperimmunized with hybrid CS31A fibrillae carrying a rotavirus VP6 epitope5. Mean background of non-specific Ab titres in the sera of hyperimmunized mice was 80 (logz=6.3).\n\nTGEV neutralization was determined using a limiting dilution microassay2\". Briefly, serial twofold or threefold dilutions of antisera were mixed with a virus suspension containing 500 p.f.u. of TGEV Purdue-l 15 strain. After incubation for 1 h at 37\"C, 4 x lo4 trypsinized swine testis (ST) cells in 50 ~1 Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% newborn calf serum were added. Neutralization titres were determined 40 h later, and calculated as the mean of the highest dilution that neutralized 100% of the cytopathic effect in duplicate experiments. A reference serum was included in each experiment.\n\nElectron microscopy of gold-immunolabelled CS3 1 Aproducing E. coli cells suggests a capsular organization of CS31A1 ( Figure IC) , while that of the purified form of CS31A reveals an abundance of very fine fibrillar organelles of 2 nm in diameter' ( Figure ZD) . In Western immunoblotting experiments, using a CS31A-specific antiserum, native CS31A appears as a ladder of bands of regulary increasing molecular mass corresponding to the multimeric form of CS3IA ( Figure IE) , and denatured CS3 I A migrates as a single band consisting essentially of the major 29Kd-ClpG subunit monomers, which can be autonomously reassociated in vitro into oligomeric reaggregated complexes' (Figure ZE) .\n\nTGEV-C and TGEV-A peptides were tandemly inserted into the aa 202-218 region of the major ClpG subunit of CS31A (Figure 2a) in two steps from pPSXlOS expressing the mutant ClpG420 protein (Figure 2b ). In the first step, synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide specifying the TGEV-A epitope ( Figure  2c ) was ligated with SpeIIBgflI-digested pPSXlOS, leading to the plasmid pGA102 expressing the ClpG203-A hybrid protein (Figure 2d ) as previously reported5. In the second step, synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the TGEV-C epitope (Figure 2e ) was ligated with SpeI-digested pGA102, resulting in the plasmid pGCA102 expressing the ClpG203-CA hybrid protein with an insert of 25 extra aa (Figure 2f ).\n\nTo allow expression of CS31A hybrid fibrillae, pGCAlO2\n\nwas transferred into E. coli DHSa [pDSPH524]. One of the transformants screened by in situ colony-immunoblotting and reactive towards the TGEV-C site-specific Mab 3b.5, the TGEV-A sitespecific Mab lA.FlO, and the ClpG-specific antiserum, was selected. Electron microscopy analysis of the immunogold-labelled E. coli cells bearing pGCAlO2 confirmed the production of the CS31A hybrid fibrillae at the cell surface ( Figure 3A ). Hybrid fibrillae were extracted by the thermo-elution procedure as described in , and separated by l&l 5% PAGE under denaturing or native conditions for Western blot analysis (Figure 3 ). The denatured form of hybrid CS31A, consisting of the ClpG203-CA monomers, exhibited two protein bands reacting with anti-ClpG antiserum ( Figure 3B ). The upper band represents the expected full-length hybrid protein since immunologically revealed additionally by 3b.5 and lA.FlO and since migrating slightly slower than the wild-type ClpG protein. By contrast, the lower band migrating faster than ClpG was recognized by anti-ClpG and 3b.5, but not by lA.FlO. The ability of hybrid ClpG203-CA subunit to polymerize into a chimerit CS31A fibrillum structure was evidenced from Western blots using PAGE under non-denaturing conditions ( Figure 3C ). Hybrid CS3 1 A fibrillum appeared as a ladder of oligomeric bands of regulary increasing molecular mass constituting the polymeric form of the CS31A chimera. Each oligomer migrated as a double protein band, the major upper band reacting with anti-CS31A, 3b.5 and lA.FlO, and the minor lower band only with anti-CS31A and 3b.5. Altogether, these findings demonstrated the normal antigenic properties of the two viral epitopes exposed on the CS3 1A hybrid fibrillae at the E. coli cell-surface. However, these results also showed that the full fusion construct was partially cleaved, likely by an undefined bacterial protease, and that, unlike TGEV-C, TGEV-A in the truncated form of hybrid was antigenically inactive.\n\nTo test the possibilities that immune responsiveness to TGEV-A and TGEV-C inserted into ClpG is modulated by the mouse haplotype, we compared the immunogenicity of ClpG203-CA protein in five strains of inbred mice and, also, in outbred Swiss mice ( Figure  4) . Groups of five animals belonging to each of the six different strains of mice, were intraperitoneally (ip.) immunized with purified ClpG203-CA monomers. In all cases, immunization resulted in the elicitation of Ab responses against ClpG and TGEV-C, but not against TGEV-A which was restricted essentially to H-2b haplotype. Moreover, only the anti-ClpG and anti-peptide C titres were positively correlated (Figure 4) . Mice with H-2d haplotype clearly appeared to be the lowest Ab producers whatever the antigen tested. While the production of anti-ClpG and anti-peptide C was better in C57BL/6 (H-2b), CBA/J (H-2k), SJL (H-2\") and Swiss mice, only the former and the latter appeared as the best responders to the ClpG-fused A peptide. Because outbred mice give high immune responses, we chose them to carry on immunological studies. In addition, their outbred status seemed more satisfying than that of inbred mice which artificially select immunological responses restricted to a laboratory animal haplotype.\n\nImmunogenic potential of the fusion construct To evaluate the immunogenic potential of the chimerit construction we compared the anti-ClpG, antipeptide A, anti-peptide C, anti-TGEV particles and virus-neutralizing Ab responses following i.p. immunization of outbred Swiss mice with either CS31A hybridexpressing bacteria, or purified CS31A hybrid polymers, or purified ClpG203-CA monomers ( Figure  5 ). It was found that mice developed serum Abs with significant titres and capable of recognizing the ClpG carrier protein, the free synthetic TGEV peptides, and the virus particles, with anti-virus titres that are equivalent whatever the type of hybrid-containing preparation used for immunization. Expression of TGEV-S sites A and C, as a fusion protein on the surface of E, coli led to induction of TGEVneutralizing Abs when purified recombinant antigen was used as immunogen, but not when live vector was administered. Ab responses in mice immunized with bacteria are lower than in mice immunized with purified proteins probably because lower yields of hybrid proteins associated to the bacteria compared to the 20 pg inoculated with purified proteins as previously discussed5. Nevertheless, these results indicate that the two TGEV peptides are immunogenic in the native ClpG-, and CS31A fibrillae-associated conformations. \n\nTo investigate whether fibrillae-associated TGEV epitopes were capable of generating memory B-cells, Swiss mice were immunized with purified hybrid fibrillae and then maintained at least for 100 days before booster either with homologous hybrid fibrillae ( Figure 6A ) or with TGEV virions ( Figure 6B ). Six days later, an expected strong memory Ab response was induced against the two TGEV peptides and the carrier protein following booster inoculation with the homologous hybrid fibrillae ( Figure 6A ). More interesting, a memory Ab response against these viral peptides was also induced following booster inoculation with virus 6 days after the last immunization, with anti-peptide A and anti-peptide C titres that increased 35-and 15.fold, respectively ( Figure 6B ). Anamnestic effects were specific to sites A and C since, in the same conditions of immunization and booster, control mice inoculated with a different CS31A hybrid, which carried the rotavirus VP6 epitope instead of TGEV epitopes, produced no anti-peptide A and only a weak response against C peptide following inoculation with TGEV ( Figure 6C ). The anti-peptide C titre elicited by the control mice at day 150 was 120.fold lower than that elicited by mice immunized with CS31A fibrillae carrying TGEV epitopes. Therefore, TGEV-A and TGEV-C under their CS31A fibrillae-associated form of fusion to the major ClpG subunit induced memory Abs, likely through B-cells activation by TGEV epitopes under their natural viral conformation.\n\nCompared to other bacterial proteins used as exposure vectors for heterologous antigenic determinants (see Ref. 24 for a review), fibrillae (or fhnbriae) have several advantages that favour their use as vaccines: being extracellular appendages their production and purification are a quick, easy and economical means to obtain a vaccine component of reproductible high qualityz5; being polymeric they allow to a foreign antigen previously inserted into the major fibrillar subunit to be exposed repeatedly along the fibrillum length and presented in great quantities on the entire bacterial cell surface, which may enhance immunogenicity26; they are good immunogens, exhibiting only low-level toxicity and since they are capable of binding to speoific receptors on mucosal surface, they may be of great value in targetin f the immunogen to those locations2'. Many fimbriae2 , and CS31A fibrillae5.r' have been used as a carrier system before. The obtained recombinant polymer proteins described in these studies were antigenic, and some induced a serological response, but up till now no immunological memory effect of immunization with purified hybrid fimbriae has been described. The present work was undertaken to test whether an effective vaccine against TGEV could be envisaged based on the exploitation of the E. coli CS31A fibrillae as a delivery system. For this purpose, two antigenic peptides of the protein S of TGEV, namely TGEV-C (aa 363-371) and TGEV-A (aa 521-531) were tandemly inserted into the aa 202-218 part of the major fibrillar ClpG subunit. We have shown previously that introduction of different foreign epitopes in this ClpG region resulted in an effective assembly of the hybrid subunits into CS3lA fibrillaej, suggesting that aa 202-218 region would be the most favourable region for insertion. From results reported here, we provide evidence that the CS31A carrier-delivery system offers a realistic epitope-based strategy for recombinant TGEV vaccine development since:\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3) (4)\n\ninsertion of TGEV-A plus TGEV-C, consisting in 25 extra aa, does not interfere with fibrillae formation; the two viral epitopes are exposed in an immunogenic conformation in the ClpG subunit, CS3lA fibrillae, and E. coli contexts; ClpG carrier is highly immunogenic; hybrid CS3 1 A fibrillae elicit systemic Ab responses reactive against TGEV peptides, native virus particles and virus infectivity; and TGEV peptides fused to CS3lA fibrillae induced Abs from memory B-cells which were activated by TGEV epitopes under their natural viral conformation in an outbred mouse population; it is unclear whether this memory response results from a cooperative effect of TGEV-A and TGEV-C peptides, the one acting as a T helper epitope and the other as a B determinant or from a B memory only18.\n\nHere, the immunogenicity of the recombinant bacteria, purified hybrid ClpG monomers or chimeric CS31A polymers was studied in i.p. immunized mice. Since, mucosal immunity is essential to provide protection against TGEV infections, we are evaluating also the secretory immunoresponses to various live E. coli producing different CS3 1A fibrillae chimeras with TGEV-A or/and TGEV-C epitopes inserted into different permissive sites of ClpG. Currently, we have some data supporting IgA responses. Thus, although results from bacteria expressing the TGEV-C::TGEV-A fusion peptide at the 202-218 region of ClpG, to which this work was focusing, are not available yet, data from bacteria presenting only TGEV-C epitope at this same region indicate that such recombinant bacteria are capable of eliciting IgA responses in mice. In this case, when five outbred Swiss mice were inoculated orally with 2 x lo9 live bacteria on days 0, 14 and 35, specific IgA Abs against the CS31A fibrillum carrier and TGEV-C peptide were detected 10 days later in intestinal fluids with a mean titre of l/180 (l/128-1/256) and l/16 (<l/16-1/32), respectively. Therefore, we think that CS31A fibrillae chimeras may prove efficient as components in combination with a mucosal adjuvant or as live oral vaccines, especially since chimeric CS3lA fibrillae can induce immunological memory and mucosal immunity in out-bred animals, and since CS3lA can also be expressed in the attenuated Salmonella typhimurium SL3261 strain'."}
