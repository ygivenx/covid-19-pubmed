{"title": "", "body": "A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) originating from Wuhan has rapidly spread throughout China, with multiple cases exported to 25 countries around the world. The cumulative number of confirmed cases has reached 75204 including 2006 deaths as of February 19, 2020 [1] . Early mean estimates of the reproduction number have been estimated in the range 1.4-2.5, comparable with estimates for seasonal, 2009 pandemic flu, SARS and MERS [2] [3] [4] [5] . The epidemic continues to spread throughout China at an alarming rate while chains of transmission start to unfold in other countries including Singapore, Korea, and Japan, indicating that the possibility of a pandemic scenario cannot be ruled out.\n\nEvidence suggest that the novel coronavirus likely jumped from a primary reservoir (e.g, horseshoe bats) to an intermediary reservoir, possibly generating an outbreak among wild animals in at least one wet market in Wuhan, China [6] [7] . The virus first infected multiple individuals visiting the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, initiating multiple chains of transmission that ensured sustained transmission in the human population [8] . While the detailed origin of the outbreak remains uncertain, significant evidence strongly links the .

From December 8, 2019 to January 21, 2020, we analyzed a total of 425 confirmed cases by date of symptoms onset including information on whether the case was linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. That is, this unique case series stratifies cases with visiting history to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which has been purported as source of this large epidemic [9] , and those arising from human-to-human transmission. Because the corresponding incidence curve is subject reporting delays, the last 12 epidemic days were excluded from our analysis. Thus, the study period is set from December 8 th , 2019 to January 9 th , 2020.\n\n.

A model schematic of the transmission dynamics is provided in Figure 1 . Primary infection (index case) occurs as a result of a spillover event, and primary infections may generate secondary cases. The number of infected individuals stemming from the market-to-human and the human-to-human route are denoted by i m and i h , respectively.\n\nWe employed a discrete-time integral equation to capture the daily incidence series with contact history.

Thus, the number of expected newly observed cases is written as follows:\n\nSubsequently, we also account for the reporting probability that depends on the type of infection.

The maximum value of the serial interval was fixed at 16 days as the cumulative probability distribution of the gamma distribution up to 16 days reaches 0.97.\n\nFor sensitivity analyses, we examined the effect of varying the mean of the serial interval on R j by varying the mean serial interval from 5.5 to 9.5 days.\n\nWe estimated model parameters and made projections using a Monte Carlo\n\nMarkov Chain (MCMC) method in a Bayesian framework.

In particular, we report estimates of the reproduction numbers for market-to-human and human-to-human transmission as well as the occurrence reporting probability and estimate the early effects of public health interventions. [2, 7] . More importantly, our results indicate a substantial contribution of mild and asymptomatic cases to the epidemic, and this could influence estimates of R derived from a single epidemic curve of observed reported cases, which does not fully capture the transmission dynamics [13, 14] .\n\nMoreover, we also identified a remarkable decrease in the reproduction number, and this decline is in line with the timing of the closing of the Huanan Seafood .

Furthermore, reporting probabilities for cases stemming from market-to-human and human-to-human cases were estimated to be low, but we estimated that the reporting rate for market-to-human route was 3-31 fold higher, suggesting that contact history with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market played a key role in identifying cases with COVID-19. Indeed, during the initial disease stages, infected individuals with COVID-19 exhibit clinical features that are similar to those of other common respiratory diseases [15] . Moreover, in the context of the ongoing influenza season, the absence of rapid diagnostic testing for this novel disease complicate case identification for this novel coronavirus [16] . Because polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which are time consuming, are not widely available, there is a crucial need to develop rapid .

First, the serial interval for COVID-19 assumed in our analyses was extrapolated from a previous study, and had to exclude recent data from the epidemic curve due to reporting delays. In fact, our sensitivity analysis on the serial interval indicate some influence on our R estimates. Further our R estimates could be further improved using additional data collected by field investigations. Second, we cannot rule out the possibility that some cases with contact history with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market got infected by contact with humans. However, our low R estimate for market-to-human transmission indicates that such a proportion is quite low. Third, our method is a powerful tool to estimate the underlying cases including asymptomatic and mild symptoms, and our results suggests \n\nThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n.
