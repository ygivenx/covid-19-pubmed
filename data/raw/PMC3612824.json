{"title": "Use of Transgenic Animals in Biotechnology: Prospects and Problems", "body": "\nAfter the successful expression of the first recombinant proteins (RPs) in\nbacteria and yeast, it became clear that a large number of human RPs could not\nbe efficiently produced using such systems. Thus, human proteins do not undergo\npost-translational modifications in bacterial cells, and the nature of the\nmodifications in yeast cells is different from those that take place in human\ncells. Additionally, these expression systems cannot ensure the proper folding\nof a number of complex human RPs [1,\n2]. Therefore, the research community\nfaced the challenge of developing alternative expression systems capable of\nensuring correct post-translational modifications in RPs. A simultaneous\ndevelopment of two technological models (based on transgenic animals and\nmammalian cell cultures) was started as a result.\n\n\n\nThe first successful production of transgenic mammals by the microinjection of\ngenetically engineered constructs into the pronucleus of a mouse zygote was\ncarried out over 20 years ago [3]. A\nlarge number of transgenic animals (TAs) have been produced since for\nscientific purposes, to improve livestock and to produce RPs\n[4\u20139].\nUntil the end of the past century, TAs had been considered to be the most\npromising models for producing human RPs and monoclonal antibodies (mAb). Yet,\nit was mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) in\nparticular) that played the dominant role in the production of RPs. Thus, 312\ntherapeutic products obtained using living organisms had been introduced to the\nU.S. market by 2012 [10]. A total of 193\nproducts were obtained using mammalian cell cultures, and 42 of them were\nproduced using CHO cell cultures. This has been largely attributed to the fact\nthat it was not until 2006 that the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA)\napproved antithrombin, the first recombinant protein derived from the milk of\ntransgenic goats [11]. This protein was\nsubsequently approved for commercialization by the United States\u2019 Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) as a drug that prevents blood clotting in patients with\nhereditary antithrombin deficiency. In 2011, the EMEA approved the use of the\nrecombinant C1-esterase inhibitor produced in rabbits for the treatment of\nhereditary angioedema. The arrival on the market of the first therapeutic\nproducts produced using TAs and their approval for medical use suggest that RPs\ncould carve out a significant niche in biotechnology in the near future. Some\nbiotechnology companies (PPL Therapeutics (England), GTC Biotherapeutics (USA)\n(acquired by LFB Biotechnologies, France, in 2010), Hematech (USA), Genzyme\n(USA), ZymoGenetics (USA), Nexia Biotechnologies (Canada), Pharming\n(Netherlands), BioProtein Technologies (France), Avigenics (USA), Viragen\n(USA), and TranXenoGen (USA)) are actively working on developing this\ntechnology. This review discusses the general concepts behind generating TAs\nfor the production of human RPs and mAb.\n\n\n\nThe contemporary methods that allow one to obtain RP-producing livestock that\ncontain the required transgene in all the cells of their organism and pass it\non to their offspring include intra-pronuclear zygotic DNA microinjection (MI)\nand somatic cell nuclear transfer (NT ). Today, DNA microinjection into the\nmale pronucleus of a zygote is the most commonly used method [12]\n(Fig. 1). As it enters\nthe nucleus, linear DNA is capable of integrating into the genome of cell lines\nor living organisms [13]. DNA is usually\nintegrated into transcriptionally inactive gene-poor regions and into\nheterochromatin. From one to several or even hundreds of copies of the injected\nconstruct can integrate into one genomic site. This technology was initially\ntested on mice, and it remains a reliable method for the production of TAs.\nThis method was used to produce the first agricultural TAs. However, MI is now\nused mainly to produce transgenic mice, rabbits and pigs. This is attributed to\nthe insufficient efficiency of the method due to the low frequency of\nincorporation of recombinant DNA into the genome and the availability of\nzygotes at the two pronuclear stages. The result depends on carrying out a\nlarge number of surgical procedures, which entails the need to keep a\nsubstantial number (200\u2013300 heads) of experimental livestock and perform\nskilled animal handling. Furthermore, the only way to determine the expression\nlevel of the integrated transgene is to examine the original TAs and their\noffspring. The reproductive cycle in large animals (including the time before\nthey reach physiological maturity and the need to obtain females producing RPs\nin milk from the original transgenic males) is approximately 0.9/2.3 years for\ngoat females/males, 1.0/2.3 years for pigs, and 2.3/4.5 years for cows. These\nlimitations increase the cost of obtaining the original TAs and the time\nrequired to organize the work.\n\n\n\nIn 1997, a sheep clone was produced by nuclear transfer (NT ) of a somatic\nmammary gland cell into an oocyte [14].\nThis achievement opened the possibility of developing cheaper and easier\nprocedures for producing agricultural TAs\n(Fig. 1), since most\nof the manipulations in this case are moved from a farm to a laboratory, where\nthe transfection of somatic cells is carried out and clones characterized by\nthe integration of the transgene into the genome are selected. The nucleus of\nthe somatic cell is then injected into the enucleated oocyte, which is\ntransplanted into female recipients. Fibroblast cells are typically used for NT.\nThe majority of recently generated large farm animals have been obtained by\nNT [12]. However, the transfected cells\nin this case are selected using antibiotic resistance marker genes, which\ncomplicates the approval of the produced recombinant proteins by the FDA and\nEMEA [15]. Fluorescent proteins, such as\nthe enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), are often used as an additional\nselective agent in order to increase efficiency in such selection\n[16]. Systems based on site-specific\nrecombinases are additionally used to remove selection markers from the genome\nof the selected cell lines [17].\n\n\n\nThe adverse effects of the NT technique include a low in utero\nembryo survival rate and poor health of the newborn animals\n[12]. This is attributed, among other things,\nto incomplete reprogramming of the somatic nucleus, resulting in impaired\nexpression of several of the genes required for the proper progression of\nembryogenesis. Moreover, the process of obtaining suitable oocytes and their\nactivation requires considerable expenditures of time and financial resources.\nAs a result, one of the world leaders in the use of NT for the production of\nagricultural TAs, the AgroResearch company (New Zealand), has rejected the\nmethod. The company is now developing alternative methods for producing\nagricultural TAs.\n\n\n\nThe site-specific transgenesis technology using embryonic stem (ES) cells could\nbe an alternative to the MI and NT methods [18].\nThis method involves the insertion of a transgene into\nthe genome of ES cells, followed by the selection of clones with a proper\nintegration of the required number of copies, before transgenic ES cells are\nintroduced into the cavity of a blastocyst, which is transplanted into a\nrecipient female. After these cells are transplanted into the ovaries of adult\nmice, up to 30% of newborn mice can carry the transgene. All animal handling\ncan be performed using nonsurgical methods, which are widely used in animal\nhusbandry. The production of transgenes requires a relatively small number of\nblastocysts and, hence, a small experimental herd. However, this method has\nonly been perfected for mice and rats; ES cell lines for farm animals have yet\nto be obtained. A similar approach involves the transformation of stem cells,\nthe precursors of sperm cells, and their subsequent transplantation into\nseminiferous tubules of infertile males [19].\n\n\n\nThe other methods for obtaining TAs are relatively rarely used. Thus, TAs can\nbe effectively produced using retroviruses containing the required transgene\n[12]. In order to achieve this\nobjective, the zygotes lacking protective coating are cultured in a medium\nsupplemented with lentiviral particles, followed by transplantation into female\nrecipients. The integration of one to several copies of the transgene occurs\ndepending on the lentiviral titer; almost 100% of the offspring can be\ntransgenic in this case [12]. The\nadvantages of this method include efficient production of any species of TAs\nand the opportunity to produce TAs carrying only one transgene copy, which is\nsometimes necessary for scientific purposes. The main drawbacks of the method\ninclude the inability to use the introns present in the gene construct and the\nlimitation of the transgene length (approximately 8000 bp), which is determined\nby the size of the viral particle. As a result, it is very difficult to achieve\na high level of transgene expression using this method.\n\n\n\nA promising method for obtaining TAs is the use of vectors based on mobile\ngenetic elements, which are integrated into the genome by transposase\n[12]. The gene encoding transposase and the\ntransgene flanked by terminal repeats of transposon are coinjected into the\nzygote. The reaction catalyzed by transposase results in the integration of a\nsingle copy of the transgene into one or several sites of the animal\u2019s genome.\nThis approach has been used to produce large farm animals (e.g. pigs\n[20]). The efficiency of the integration of the\ntransgene in this case depends on the type of transposon, transgene length,\nconcentration and site of DNA injection, and can be as high as 50%\n[20]. However, no data regarding the levels of\nexpression of the target gene in the TAs produced using this method have been\nobtained thus far.\n\n\n\nThe group of methods based on infecting the organs or tissues of an organism\nwith a replication-defective adenovirus containing the gene of the target\nprotein should be specifically mentioned. This approach results in a short-term\nnonhereditary production of RPs in the organ or tissue under consideration.\n\n\n\nToday, it remains difficult to compare the efficiency of new and traditional\nmethods for producing TAs.\n\n\n\nThe expression vectors used to produce RPs in milk contain regulatory regions\nof genes whose protein products comprise the major fraction of milk. The most\npopular examples of the latter include the regulatory regions of the\nlactoglobulin sheep gene, the acidic protein gene of rodents (mouse, rat) and\nrabbit, the \u03b1-lactalbumin and \u03b1-S1-casein genes of cow, and the goat \u03b2-casein\ngene [5]. An expression vector typically\nincludes a long 5\u2019-region (1\u20137 kb) which consists of a promoter,\ntissue-specific enhancers that increase the expression in mammary glands, the\nfirst non-coding exons and introns located between them\n(Fig. 2A).\nThe first introns of the genes are likely to contain the\nregulatory elements which can enhance gene transcription. The expression vector\nalso includes the 3\u2019-untranslated region (UTR ) of a gene, whose size can vary\nfrom 0.5 to 10 kb and even more. The 3\u2019-UTR typically includes the last\nnon-coding exons and introns, a polyadenylation site, and the adjacent\nsequences, which have the potential to enhance transcription termination. The\n5\u2019- and 3\u2019-UTR s in a vector may belong to either one or different genes.\n\n\n\nAmong the promoters used for expression in mammary glands, the \u03b2-casein gene\npromoter is one of the most efficient and is used for the production of target\nproteins in the mammary glands of mice, goats and cows\n(Table 1).\nThe most popular commercial vector for the production of RPs in\nthe milk of TAs \u2013 pBC1 (Invitrogen) \u2013 was produced using the aforementioned\npromoter (Fig. 2B).\nThis vector allowed one to obtain most of\nthe transgenic goat lines characterized by a high level of target protein\nproduction. The regulatory region of the \u03b2-casein gene with a length of 6.2 kb\nand consisting of a promoter and a hormone-dependent enhancer that stimulates\nthe promoter only in the mammary gland cells is used in this vector\n[31]. The structure of the vector also includes\na 7.8-kb-long 3\u2019-region of the \u03b2-casein gene, which ensures efficient\ntranscription termination. The latter is required for the formation of a stable\nmRN A encoding the target protein and for the prevention of the transcription\nof the adjacent genomic regions capable of causing the formation of repressed\nchromatin by RN A interference. In order to accumulate the target protein in\nmilk, the coding region of the gene must contain the signal peptide sequence\nrequired for secretion. This sequence can be obtained from any gene encoding\nthe secreted protein.\n\n\n\nDepending on the aim, either a complete gene with introns or its cDNA or a\nmini-gene containing only some of the introns is inserted into the vector. The\nuse of a gene with an unmodified exon\u2013intron structure allows one to obtain\nmuch higher levels of target protein production in TAs in comparison with the\nuse of cDNA [32, 33]. For instance, the human lactoferrin gene was expressed\nusing the same vector, pBC1, in several independent studies\n(Fig. 2B).\nThe concentration of recombinant lactoferrin did not exceed 4\nmg/ml of mouse milk and 0.7 mg/ml of transgenic goat milk if cDNA was used to\nproduce the TAs (Table 1).\nTransgenic mice were produced using\nthe native lactoferrin gene with introns (50 kb long). The concentration of\nrecombinant lactoferrin in their milk was as high as 160 mg/ml\n(Table 1).\nTransgenic goats carrying one copy of the construct but expressing\nup to 10 mg/ml of the recombinant human lactoferrin in their milk have also\nbeen produced [22]. The difference in the expression of recombinant lactoferrin\nusing the \u03b1S1-casein promoter of cows was similar\n(Table 1).\nThis example demonstrates that the presence of introns in the coding region of\nthe transgene results in a two-fold increase in the amount of the target\nprotein in milk.\n\n\n\nThe site at which the construct is integrated into the genome plays a crucial\nrole in ensuring efficient transgene expression. Injected DNA is typically\nincorporated into the gene-poor regions, which are characterized by frequent\nDNA breaks [13]. The chromatin in these regions typically exerts a negative\ninfluence on the expression of the transgene integrated nearby. In addition,\nseveral copies of the construct are typically integrated onto the same genomic\nsite, which can, in turn, lead to repression of transcription due to the\nformation of heterochromatin in repetitive sequences.\n\n\n\nA number of regulatory elements are used to protect the transgene expression\nfrom repression and to maintain the direct relationship between the number of\ncopies and the level of transgene expression in mammalian cell cultures:\nA/T-rich regions of DNA, which bind to the nuclear matrix fraction (known as\nMAR/SARelements) [34, 35]; regulatory elements (UC OE) that activate the\npromoters of the \u201chousehold\u201d genes [36]; STAR-elements that can block the\nspread of heterochromatin [37]; and insulators [38, 39].\n\n\n\nAmong the mentioned regulatory elements, only insulators are used in vector\nconstructs to produce TAs. Insulators are the regulatory elements that block\nthe interaction between an enhancer and a promoter, if located between them\n[40, 41]. Moreover, some insulators can act as a boundary between the\ntranscriptionally active chromatin and heterochromatin. The insulator from a\ncluster of chicken \u03b2-globin genes (HS4 insulator) is one of the most intensely\nstudied vertebrate insulators. It is 1200 bp long and is located at the 5\u2019-end\nof the \u03b2-globin locus [42]. A 250-bp-long core region characterized by full\ninsulator activity has been found in it. This segment contains the binding site\nfor the CTC F protein, which is the only characterized vertebrate insulator\nprotein [43]. The CTC F protein is responsible for the ability of the HS4\ninsulator to block enhancers. It also assists the USF1 and USF2 proteins (which\nform the boundary between active chromatin and heterochromatin) to bind to the\ninsulator [44]. The HS4 insulator sequence also binds to the BGP1/Vezf1 protein\n[45], which protects the GC-rich sequences of an insulator against methylation,\nwhich leads to a disruption of the binding of insulator proteins to DNA and, as\na result, to inactivation of the insulator. According to the existing model,\nBGP1/Vezf1 also terminates the weak transcription initiated in the\nheterochromatic region, which can play an important role in protecting the\n\u03b2-globin locus against the propagation of inactive chromatin [46]. The pBC1\nvector constructed by Invitrogen (USA) for TAs production contains two\n1.2-kb-long copies of the HS4 insulator at the 5\u2019-end of the vector\n(Fig. 2B).\nA thorough analysis of the effect of the HS4\ninsulator on the transcriptional activity of several promoters, including the\ngoat \u03b2-casein promoter and rabbit WAP-promoter, demonstrated that the insulator\nsignificantly increases the level of transgene expression and the number of\ntransgenic lines that are characterized by a significant production of the\ntarget protein [22, 47\u201350]. Meanwhile, the HS4 insulator neither affects the\nvariability of the transgene expression and its ectopic expression in other\ntissues of the organism nor ensures a direct correlation between the number of\ntransgene copies and its level of expression. Thus, the HS4 insulator acts as a\nuniversal transcription regulator that can be used to increase the activity of\nweak promoters. However, it does not allow to achieve efficient transgene\nexpression exclusively in a mammary gland, which is important for the\nproduction of many target proteins that can adversely affect the health of TAs.\n\n\n\nIncreasing the size of the regulatory sequences in the transgene construction\ncan be an alternative to insulators and other regulatory elements. Multiple\nloci expressing milk protein genes possess extended 5\u2019- and 3\u2019-regions, which\ncan contain both tissue-specific enhancers and insulators capable of providing\nprotection against the influence of adjacent genes. For instance, a 50-kb-long\nconstruct was synthesized in which the coding region (3 kb) of the mouse WAP\ngene consisting of 24 kb was replaced with a structural part of the human\nlactoferrin gene (29 kb) [21]. As a\nresult, transgenic mice have been obtained whose mammary glands are\ncharacterized by high tissue-specific transgene expression, and the production\nof recombinant human lactoferrin in their milk was as high as 30 mg/ml\n(Table 1).\n\n\n\nAnother method for obtaining TAs that efficiently produce target proteins is\nthe integration of large DNA segments (up to 250 kb) into the genome. Vectors\nbased on bacterial artificial chromosomes (bacmids), which enable cloning of\nsequences up to 400 kb long, can be used to prepare these extended gene\nconstructs [51,\n52]. The regulatory regions of\ntissue-specific genes can occupy large genomic regions and be a part of the\nneighboring genes. For example, several enhancers that stimulate the pig WAP\ngene are found 140 kb away from the gene they regulate and are separated from\nit by the other genes [53]. When large\nDNA fragments are used, it is highly likely that all of the regulatory elements\nof this gene are included in the transgene. It is assumed that the use of this\napproach results in specific transgene expression exclusively in the mammary\ngland and that the influence of the surrounding chromatin on transgene expression\nis minimized. This approach allows one to obtain TAs whose level of transgene\nexpression closely corresponds to the expression of the endogenous counterpart.\nFor instance, transgenic cows expressing the genes of human lactoferrin and human\n\u03b1-lactalbumin have been produced (Table 1).\nIn general, this method allows one to achieve stable transgene expression at a level similar to\nthat of native genes. Thus, the levels of production of lactoferrin and alpha-lactalbumin in\ntransgenic cows were 3.4 and 1.55 mg/ml, respectively\n(Table 1). The problem is\nassociated with the other genes, which are a part of the bacmid structure and whose\nexpression can adversely affect the health of the TAs. It should also be mentioned\nthat the use of a bacmid does not completely suppress the effect of the genomic\nsurrounding: the expression is partially dependent on the genome integration site\n[54, 55].\nIn this case, there is no direct observable relationship between the number of bacmid\ncopies and the expression level. This can be attributed to the fact that the initiated\nRN A interference adversely affects the gene expression in a bacmid.\n\n\n\nSince the early 1990s, attempts have been made to produce TAs that synthesize a\nvariety of human proteins. Today, these proteins are produced in other\nexpression systems (bacteria, yeast, mammalian cells). Most of the recombinant\nhuman proteins that are produced in mammalian cell cultures are plasma proteins\n[56]. The use of recombinant plasma\nproteins grows every year as the scope of their application expands and the use\nof human tissues for isolating native proteins is constrained by the existing\nrisk of viral contamination, the small number of donors, and ethical\nconsiderations. The coagulation factors VII, VIII and IX are used for lifelong\ntreatment of hereditary diseases. An immune response to therapeutic agents\ndevelops in most patients over time, despite the highly efficient purification\nof the proteins produced in bacterial or yeast systems. This fact creates the\nneed for replacing the drug with an analog produced in a different manner.\nTherefore, the production of recombinant coagulation factors in the milk of TAs\nis of significant medical importance [57].\nTable 2 shows some examples of TAs whose\nmilk contains human blood clotting factors. Treatment of blood diseases in most\ncases requires a comparatively small amount (calculated in grams) of RPs.\nConsequently, a rabbit is the optimal TA for producing RPs: each transgenic\nrabbit female can produce approximately 5 liters of milk per lactation or 20 g\nof RPs per year. The results obtained demonstrate that the expression of\ncoagulation factors does not affect animal health and lactation\n[74, 75].\n\n\n\nUnlike the coagulation factors VII, VIII and IX, the demand for recombinant\nalbumin is calculated in tons, since albumin is used not only in medicine, but\nalso in biotechnology to stabilize other proteins. Albumin is the major blood\nprotein, which is usually isolated from plasma. The production of recombinant\nalbumin is more expensive than its isolation from blood plasma, since a very\nhigh degree of purification is required for its medical application. Nowadays,\nrecombinant albumin is produced mostly in yeasts Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae (RecombuminTM) and Pichia pastoris\n(AlbrecTM). The huge demand for recombinant albumin has\ndetermined the choice of transgenic cows for its production. Thus, GTC\nBiotherapeutics (USA) has recently created transgenic cows whose average level\nof recombinant human albumin (rhAB) production in milk is 1\u20135 mg/ml\n[15] or up to 30 kg per producing cow per year.\nThe same work described a line of transgenic cows whose RHA concentration in\nmilk was as high as 48 mg/ml, which corresponds to the integration of 250\ncopies of the construct. Transgenic cows of this line are characterized by a\nshorter period of lactation and a decrease in the milk yield. Thus, it can be\nassumed that the production of rhAB in the milk of transgenic cows must be\nbelow 48 mg/ml.\n\n\n\nCertain proteins, such as hormones and cytokines, have a negative effect on the\nlactation and health of TAs. This makes maintenance of the transgenic herd\nproblematic. The most notable project undertaken by the PharmAthene Inc.\ncompany (USA) on the instructions of the Ministry of Defense is connected with\nthe production of butyrylcholinesterase (Table 2),\na highly active enzyme that efficiently protects against organophosphate poisons. As a\nresult, a herd of goats has been produced whose level of production of\nrecombinant human butyrylcholinesterase (rhBChE) in milk is 1\u20135 mg/ml\n[59]. The main problem the company encountered\nwas the effect of rhBChE on lactation. The latter significantly reduced the\nproductivity of transgenic goats [76].\nAs a result, a question regarding the economic feasibility of using transgenic\ngoats to obtain rhBChE has arisen.\n\n\n\nThere are several approaches that allow one to produce RPs that adversely\naffect lactation and the health of the TAs; however, they only resolve the\nproblem partially. First of all, a promoter that stably functions only in the\nmammary gland at a relatively low level can be selected. For instance, a\nrecombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) was produced\nusing the \u03b2-casein gene promoter without an enhancer in transgenic goats\n(Table 2)\n[60].\nHowever, the rhG-CSF concentration in the milk of the goats did not exceed 0.05\nmg/ml. Transgenic mice with milk containing 0.02\u20130.04 mg/ml of rhG-CSF have\nalso been produced. An expression vector containing the 5\u2019-regulatory region of\nthe CSN1S1 gene of a goat (3387 bp), including the first\nintron and the 3\u2019-region of the CSN1S1 gene of a cow (1518 bp)\nwith non-coding exons 18 and 19, was also used [67].\nAs a result, it was demonstrated that transgenic mice carrying this vector express rhG-CSF\nexclusively in milk, but not in other tissues. However, the low level of RPs in the milk\nreduces the economic attractiveness of this approach.\n\n\n\nAn alternative way to produce RPs, which adversely affects the health of the\nproducing TAs, is infection of a mammary gland with replication-defective\nvectors based on adenoviruses. Thus, an adenoviral vector designed to express\nrecombinant human erythropoietin was produced at the Laboratory of Transgenesis\nand Animal Cloning (Havana, Cuba). The erythropoietin concentration in the milk\nof the goats infected with this adenovirus reached 2 mg/ml, but it exhibited a\nlow biological activity, which was presumably due to insufficient glycosylation\nof the protein produced using this approach [77].\nThe production of the recombinant human growth hormone in\nmice (2 mg/ml) and goats (0.3 mg/ml) using adenoviral vectors has been\ndescribed [78]. A similar approach was\nused in the case of recombinant human lactoferrin, whose concentration in the\nmilk of goats was as high as 2 mg/ml [79].\nDespite the simplicity of using an animal adenoviral vector to create TAs expressing\nthe target protein in milk, this method does not allow one to obtain a stable\nexpression of the recombinant protein at a level sufficient for its commercial\nproduction. A high expression level (1.5\u20132 mg/ml) was observed exclusively during\nthe first 25 days of lactation, which can be explained by either natural death of\nthe transfected cells or the immune response to the infection.\n\n\n\nFinally, the production of the inactive forms of proteins is considered to be a\npromising approach. For instance, an expression vector containing\nerythropoietin cDNA integrated into the fifth exon of the lactoglobulin gene of\na cow [68] in such a manner that there\nwas a region cleavable by IgA-protease between the coding regions of two genes\nwas constructed in order to produce recombinant human erythropoietin. As a\nresult, transgenic mice and rabbits were produced in whose milk the\nconcentration of chimeric protein reached 0.3 and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively.\nFollowing the cleavage of the chimeric protein by IgA-protease, the activity of\nerythropoietin was restored and lactation and the health of the TAs were not\naffected. It is also possible to use the co-expression of RPs and an inhibitor\nthat blocks its activity. Thus, the recombinant human prourokinase expressed in\nmilk almost immediately transforms into its active form, urokinase, which makes\nthis bioreactor unpromising with respect to the production of a therapeutic\nform of the protein (prourokinase). Prourokinase was co-expressed with the\nbacterial serine protease inhibitor in the milk of transgenic mice in order to\nresolve this problem [80]. This allowed\nto purify the milk of transgenic mice from the processed prourokinase\n(urokinase) and to dramatically increase the yield of the therapeutic form of\nthe protein.\n\n\n\nIt should be mentioned that sialylation of RPs in the milk of transgenic\nrabbits and pigs is most similar to sialylation in human cells, which is\nessential for reducing the immunogenicity of the drugs used in long-term therapy\n[81, 82].\nIncorrect post-translational modifications that reduce\nthe activity of the recombinant protein can occur in the milk of transgenic\ngoats and cows. The easiest way to remove the incorrect modification is\nmutation in the protein site where the undesired modification occurs. For\nexample, alpha-fetoprotein, a single chain glycosylated plasma protein with a\nmolecular weight of 68 kDa, is used to treat autoimmune diseases. The demand\nfor a properly folded recombinant human alpha-fetoprotein (rh-AFP) is extremely\nhigh (kilograms of protein are needed); hence, the Merrimack Pharma company\n(USA), together with GTC Biotherapeutics (USA), have launched a project for the\nproduction of transgenic goats that produce rh-AFP in their milk. The human\nalpha-fetoprotein isolated from the milk of transgenic goats was glycosylated\nat the asparagine residue located at position 233, which greatly reduced its\nactivity. Therefore, the glutamine residue replaced the asparagine residue in\nrh-AFP, which caused inactivation of the glycosylation site\n[58, 83].\nIt was demonstrated that the biological activity and pharmacokinetics of the mutant\nvariant of alpha-fetoprotein are similar to those of the native protein.\n\n\n\nThe mAb market is the fastest growing segment of the pharmaceutical industry.\nTherapeutic mAbs, most of which are used to treat cancer and autoimmune\ndiseases, generated profit of over $26 billion for American biotechnological\ncompanies in 2007 [84].\n\n\n\nThe mAbs currently used in medicine are produced exclusively in mammalian cell\ncultures, since proper post-translational modifications are required to ensure\ntherapeutic efficiency. The most important modifications include the attachment\nof oligosaccharides and sialic acid, which considerably increase the mAbs\nbloodstream circulation time and reduce their immunogenicity. However, the RPs\nproduced in cell cultures have a relatively high cost. Hence, an attempt to use\nTAs to produce antibodies was made at the end of the 1990s\n[85, 86].\nSince mAbs are composed of two polypeptide chains, two\nconstructs containing the genes encoding heavy and light subunits were used for\ntheir expression in TAs. When producing TAs, several constructs encoding the\nheavy and light chains of the antibody are typically incorporated into the same\ngenomic site. During the initial experiments, mAbs were expressed using various\ngene promoters of milk proteins, e.g., sheep \u03b2-lactoglobulin\n[87] and mouse WAP\n[88, 89].\nTransgenic mice whose milk contains mAbs at relatively high concentrations of 0.4\u20135 mg/ml\nhave been produced as a result (Table 3).\nmAbs for pharmaceutical production were subsequently obtained from transgenic goats;\nmAbs for testing expression vectors, evaluating the quality of mAbs, and\nrefining the methods used for their isolation were obtained from transgenic\nmice. The pBC1 vector described above has been widely used for the expression\nof mAbs (Fig. 2B).\nThe highest expression levels of mAbs in transgenic mice (as high as 32 mg/ml of milk)\nwere obtained using this vector (Table 3).\nHowever, published data on the expression level of mAbs in the milk of transgenic goats are virtually\nabsent. Transgenic goats, one of which showed an expression level approaching 14 mg/ml, have been\nmentioned in only one review [86].\n\n\n\nAccording to the data provided by the GTC Biotherapeutics company (USA), mAbs\nisolated from the milk of transgenic goats are typically stable and highly\nefficient; even high levels of mAb expression do not affect the health and\nlactation of transgenic goats. The company has developed relatively simple\nmethods for obtaining highly purified mAbs that are suitable for medical applications\n[95, 96].\nThe conducted investigations led to regarding transgenic goats as the optimal model for\nthe production of mAbs [97].\nThe attractiveness of transgenic goats is attributed to\nthe fact that they rarely get infected with BSE, in comparison with sheep and\ncows. Transgenic goats from New Zealand or Australia are currently being used\nfor the production of RPs in milk, since it is officially believed that there\nis no cow disease in these countries.\n\n\n\nThe demand for mAbs recently hit the several-hundred- kilograms-per-year mark.\nFor example, world demand for anti-receptor CD20 mAbs exceeds 600 kg per year.\nIt is estimated that a herd consisting of 210 transgenic goats whose milk\ncontains mAbs at a concentration of 8 g/l can fully meet the world demand in anti-CD20\nmAbs at an approximate cost of $100/g [85].\nMeanwhile, 51,000 l of cell culture with the capacity of 1g/l and an approximate cost\nof $300/g are required to obtain an equal amount of mAbs.\n\n\n\nDespite the relatively low cost of mAb production in transgenic goats, there\nare some drawbacks associated with their use in comparison with the use of\nmammalian cell cultures. Firstly, the antibodies must be properly glycosylated\nand sialylated, which is important for their stability, immunogenicity, and\nbiological activity. Sialylation and glycosylation occur in the mammary glands\nof transgenic goats, but it may be incomplete. In addition, an increase in the\nlevel of mAb expression is associated with a decrease in glycosylation\nefficiency. Therefore, 2\u20134 mg/ml is considered to be an optimal level of mAbs\nin milk. The second problem is associated with the fact that sialic acid is\npresent in transgenic goats in the form of N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA)\n[98], while human antibodies contain\nNglycolylneuraminic acid (NGNA). There is a possibility that antibodies\ncontaining the \u201cwrong\u201d sialic acid could be immunogenic to patients in some\ncases. Recombinant proteins in mammalian cell cultures also undergo\nheterogeneous glycosylation and sialylation. These processes are usually not\ncompletely identical to their native counterparts. In order to overcome this\nhurdle, additional genes encoding transporters and enzymes, which increase the\nlevel of glycosylation and sialylation, and/ or genes whose RN A-product\ninduces inactivation of the genes encoding the proteins that adversely affect\nglycosylation, are introduced into the cell lines producing the recombinant proteins\n[99, 100].\nAn opportunity to inactivate the genes involved in the\nglycosylation of RPs in the cell lines, which is different from glycosylation\nin human cells, recently became available due to the development of the new\ntechnologies of site-directed mutagenesis. Similar approaches cannot be used\nfor producing animals, since the changes in the genome can adversely affect the\nviability of the TAs. The only potential option is to create TAs using a vector\nunder strict control of expression exclusively in the mammary gland. This\nvector must express additional genes which increase/modify glycosylation and\ngenes that encode groups of RN A capable of inactivating the genes whose\nprotein products are responsible for the abnormal glycosylation of RPs.\nFinally, the presence of approximately 0.3\u20130.5 mg/ml of endogenous\nimmunoglobulins in goat milk poses an additional problem during mAb\npurification. Therefore, an efficient chromatographic separation of goat and\nhuman immunoglobulins is required in order to obtain highly purified mAbs\n[86]. Meanwhile, the introduction of\nsynthetic media for the cultivation of cell cultures significantly simplifies\nthe stage of recombinant protein purification, which somewhat reduces the cost\nof obtaining highly purified mAbs.\n\n\n\nIt has recently been demonstrated that the absence of fucose in the glycol\nchain of an antibody results in an induction of cytotoxicity at an antibody\nconcentration ten times lower than in the case when conventional antibodies are\nused [101]. A model based on transgenic\nrabbits could be cost-effective for producing these defucosylated antibodies.\nInterestingly, no fucose residues have been identified in the recombinant human\nC1- inhibitor isolated from the milk of transgenic rabbits, suggesting the\nabsence of active fucosylation in rabbit mammary glands. Thus, transgenic\nrabbits can become an attractive model for the production of this new class of\nhighly active antibodies.\n\n\n\nA large-scale project to obtain mAbs in TAs was initiated in the late 1990s by\nGenzyme Transgenic company (currently known as GTC Biotherapeutics), which\nsigned contracts with a large number of companies developing mAbs as\ntherapeutic agents. During the initial stage, mAbs were obtained in transgenic\nmice in order to assess their overall activity. If the levels of expression and\nbiological activity of mAbs in transgenic mice were comparable to the expected\nvalues, goats-producers were created during the second stage. GTC\nBiotherapeutics is currently developing a technology for the production of\nseveral widely used mAbs (Rituximab\u00ae, Herceptin\u00ae,\nHumira\u00ae, and Erbitux\u00ae) in transgenic goats. Work aimed at\nproducing RPs in transgenic goats is being actively conducted in China and New\nZealand.\n\n\n\nAt the moment, the FDA is nearing approval for salmon which expresses the\ngrowth hormone for commercial use (AquAdvantage) (according to the findings, it\nis safe for humans and the environment) [11,\n102]. The economic impact in the case of\ntransgenic salmon is associated with an almost twofold increase in growth, which\nsignificantly reduces the cost of cultivation.\nTherefore, it can be assumed that in the near future permission for the\ncommercial application of various TAs will be obtained. These TAs can be used\nto achieve such important objectives as 1) producing modified milk containing\nhuman RPs; 2) altering the composition of milk to increase efficiency in dairy\nproducts production; 3) improving the characteristics of farm animals (fast\ngrowth, recycling); and 4) improving the resistance of farm animals to\nbacterial, viral, and prion infections [103].\n\n\n\nThe issues of artificial infant feeding and nutrition of newborns is gaining in\nimportance. In terms of its composition, breast milk is significantly different\nfrom goat and cow milk. Thus, human milk contains much higher concentrations of\nlactoferrin (2.0\u20135.8 mg/ml), lysozyme (0.03\u20133 mg/ml), and lactalbumin (1.8\u20133.1\nmg/ml). These proteins protect the organism against infections, improve the\nstructure of the intestinal epithelium, have a positive effect on the\nintestinal microflora, and enhance immunity. Meanwhile, the concentration of\nthese proteins is significantly lower in cow milk: 0.03\u20130.49 mg/ml for\nlactoferrin, 0.05\u20130.22 mg/ml for lysozyme, and 1.47 mg/ml for lactalbumin. The\nmixtures for artificial feeding produced using animal milk do not provide\noptimal infant nutrition, since they are prepared from hydrolysates and contain\nno functional proteins.\n\n\n\nTransgenic cows expressing recombinant lactoferrin (3.4 mg/ml)\n[16], lysozyme (0.03 mg/ml)\n[17] or human lactalbumin (1.5 mg/ml)\n[33] have been obtained in China to produce\nmodified milk. Milk containing all three human RPs at the optimal concentration\nis intended for production next. Transgenic goats whose milk contains\nrecombinant human lysozyme at a concentration of 0.27 mg/ml\n[31] (corresponding to 67% of the lysozyme\nconcentration in breast milk) have been obtained in the USA. It was\ndemonstrated that pasteurized milk with human lysozyme has a positive effect on\nthe health of young goats and pigs\n[104, 105].\nThe University of California, Davis (USA), and the Institute of Biomedicine of the\nFederal University of Ceara (Brazil) received a grant from the Government of\nBrazil to explore the possibility of using milk containing recombinant human\nlysozyme to treat diarrhea in children from low-income families. Production of\ntransgenic goats expressing recombinant lactoferrin in milk for the subsequent\nproduction of milk simultaneously containing a combination of two human\nproteins is also scheduled.\n\n\n\nThe government-owned AgroResearch company in New Zealand produces transgenic\ncows with the aim of increasing efficiency in cheese production. Caseins, the\nmost valuable proteins, comprise approximately 80% of milk proteins. The casein\nfraction in cow milk consists of \u03b1-S1-, \u03b1-S2-, \u03b2- and k-caseins, encoded by a\nsingle copy of each gene [106]. Caseins\naggregate into large micelles. The micellar structure and its stability may\nvary depending on the ratio of caseins, which affects the physical and chemical\nproperties of the milk. Cheese is made via the aggregation of casein micelles,\nwhich retain water and fat by forming a protein network. An increased content\nof \u03b2- and k-caseins leads to a reduction in the micellar size and increases\nthermal stability, which is necessary for cheese production\n[107]. In order to increase the amount of\n\u03b2- and k-caseins in milk, transgenic cows with additional copies of the gene were\nproduced [108]. The endogenous \u03b2-casein\ngene of cows with its regulatory sequences was used. Since the k-casein gene is\ncharacterized by a relatively low expression level, a chimeric gene containing\nthe regulatory region of the \u03b2-casein gene and the coding region of the\nk-casein was used for the production of transgenic cows. The transgenic cows\nwere eventually produced; their milk was characterized by a 20% increase in the\nlevel of \u03b2-casein expression and a twofold increase in k-casein synthesis. This\nresult clearly demonstrates the fact that the milk content can be altered by\ntransgenesis, which can increase efficiency in the multi-billiondollar cheese\nproduction industry.\n\n\n\nOne of the problems in swine breeding is the high mortality of piglets\nattributed to the insufficient content of \u03b1-lactalbumin in milk. In order to\ntackle the problem, we produced transgenic pigs with the \u03b1-lactalbumin gene of\ncows inserted into their genome, which resulted in an increase in the lactose\nconcentration in milk [109]. This\nsignificantly decreased the mortality rate among the piglets that were fed the\nmodified milk. Another problem in swine breeding is the pollution of the\nenvironment with their feces, which contain high levels of phosphorus. This\nproblem was resolved by producing transgenic pigs whose genome contained an\ninserted phytase-encoding gene of bacterial origin\n[110]. As a result, the level of\nphosphates in the feces of the transgenic pigs decreased by 75%.\n\n\n\nResistance to diseases is another extremely important aspect in the application\nof transgenesis in agriculture. Thus, the losses inflicted by mastitis\n(inflammation of the mammary gland caused by bacterial infection) in cattle\nexceed 1.7 billion dollars a year in the USA alone\n[111]. Mastitis is typically caused by\nstaphylococci. Lysostaphin, a powerful peptidoglycan hydrolase secreted by\nStaphylococcus simulans, exhibits a bactericidal effect\nagainst staphylococci, causing mastitis. Transgenic cows\n[69] whose milk contains lysostaphin\nat a concentration of 0.014 mg/ml have been obtained. It was demonstrated that\nsuch cows are characterized by increased resistance to staphylococcal infections.\n\n\n\nBovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as mad cow disease) is the\nmost lethal disease affecting cattle in countries of the Northern Hemisphere.\nRemoval of the prion protein gene that causes the disease was proposed as a way\nto combat it [112]. As a result,\ntransgenic cows lacking the gene (and, thus, resistant to BSE) have been\nproduced [113]. It is obvious that the\nuse of such cows can reduce the incidence and spread of the disease epidemics.\n\n\n\nThese examples demonstrate that the use of TAs in agriculture is highly\npromising. The main restriction to the widespread distribution of TAs is the\nfear of the wider public regarding the safety of transgenic food products. More\nstringent regulatory requirements are imposed as a result, making it difficult\nto obtain permission to use TAs. In 2009 (the current edition from May 17,\n2011), after more than 10 years of development, the FDA approved a procedure\nfor considering applications for using TAs [114].\nThe procedure for the approval of new products is simpler in developing countries,\nand both the government and the public view TAs as one of the ways to resolve the problem\nof food security and improvement of living standards. As a result, most of the projects on\nthe applications of TAs in agriculture are currently being implemented in countries, such as\nBrazil, Argentina, and China.\n\n\n\nEfficient methods for producing TAs expressing RPs have been developed over the\npast 20 years. TAs offer opportunities to significantly reduce costs in\nproducing mAb and human RPs with post-translational modifications that closely\nmatch those of human proteins.\n\n\n\nUntil recently, the main reasons behind the reluctance to produce RPs using TAs\nin developing countries included a lack of developed laws regulating the use of\nTAs, strict ethical standards, and protests in the public against the use of\nanimals as bioreactors.\n\n\n\nHowever, the situation has begun to change. Detailed regulations to accompany\nthe use of TAs for the production of RPs have been developed. The establishment\nof two manufacturing productions of RPs in the milk of TAs approved by\nregulatory agencies in the USA and EU has removed many issues related to the\norganization of production, while the expiration of patents on many biological\npreparations has increased competition between manufacturers, forcing companies\nto search for the most economically efficient technological models of\nproduction. Thus, it is very likely that in the near future the use of TAs in\nthe biotechnology and food industries will expand.\n"}
