{"title": "Pattern of patients and diseases during mass transit: The day of Arafat experience", "body": "Hajj is a yearly Islamic event during which millions of Muslim men and women gather in the surroundings of the Holy city of Makkah in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The actual pilgrimage is of 5 days duration but pilgrims, in particular those who have travelled from outside the Middle East, tend to stay for longer periods of time either before the start of Hajj or after the event.\n\nOut of the 5 days of Hajj, pilgrims\u2019 main stay is in the plains of Mina adjacent to Makkah, where they perform different rituals. However, on the second day there is a mass movement of all pilgrims from Mina to the plains of Arafat starting from dawn until afternoon. This is known as \u201cThe Day of Arafat\u201d. All pilgrims then leave Arafat after sunset to spent night at Muzdalifa before going back to their tents in Mina.\n\nThe Ministry of Health (MOH) in KSA, in association with the Ministry of Hajj, caters for the health issues related to all pilgrims during the Hajj season. It also involves International collaboration for mutual benefits and to share the vast experience.1,2 Besides mobilizing the local resources, it temporarily employs highly qualified doctors, paramedics and related staff from other parts of the Muslim world. All levels of medical care to pilgrims is free of charge. MOH has well equipped and staffed hospitals and health facilities in Mina, with back up support in Makkah city to look after any expected or unexpected emergencies besides routine ailments. Hospitals and health centers have been established in Arafat to provide care to any medical emergencies during the short stay of pilgrims there while they are in transit.3,4 This study was undertaken to explore the characteristics of patients and their illnesses reporting sick in Arafat with the aim to subsequently use this information for allocation and adjustment of facilities there in coming Hajj seasons.\n\nDue to expansion projects underway in the Holy Mosque at Makkah, the quota for pilgrims from within the KSA and from outside Kingdom was markedly reduced. Still 1,980,249 registered pilgrims performed Hajj in 2013, 37 % less than the previous year.5 As explained earlier, all of these pilgrims did the mass movement from Mina to Arafat on the second day of Hajj before leaving for Muzdalifa on the same day after sun set. Nimra Hospital, where this study was done is one of the four hospitals situated in Arafat. It has a bed capacity of 90, with an ER and 15 clinics. Arafat has three other relatively bigger hospitals, namely Arafat General, Jabal-ur-Rahma and East Arafat hospitals with bed capacities of 300, 140 and 236 respectively. Nimra Hospital along with other three hospitals, being well equipped and staffed, rendered services throughout the Hajj season. However, the present study is concerned specifically to the Day of Arafat.\n\nAll patients reporting sick to the Nimra Hospital on the Day of Arafat were included and documented. A detailed Performa was required to be filled by the medical staff. This included details related to patient, his/her illness and disposal. The documents were collected by the Department of Quality and Patient Safety, MOH, Makkah Region and have been analyzed in the study using SPSS version 19.0.\n\nPatients with Bronchial Asthma (34) and injuries (33) were the most common amongst a variety of conditions for which patients reported sick to our hospital in Arafat during this transitory phase. Out of 33 injuries, 8 were of a grave nature. Details of conditions encountered are in Table-I. Miscellaneous causes includes conditions seen only once like Epilepsy.\n\nOut of 211 patients received at our Arafat medical facility on that day, there were two deaths. One patient was brought in dead with a history suggestive of heat stroke while the other, a 50 year old male, also had heat stroke, died while in hospital. Only six patients were referred/transferred to main hospitals in Mina and Makkah. They included 3 road accident patients and one each with peritonitis, cerebro-vascular-accident and chronic renal failure. Eleven patients were advised to stay but left against medical advice while remaining 192 were discharged in stable condition after receiving necessary treatment and care. Table-II.\n\nThe study covers the patients attending just one facility at Arafat, hence does not give a comprehensive picture of the situation as there are many other hospitals an out patient clinics in the area. As such the results cannot be generalized.\n\nArafat Hospitals should continue to have the services of adequate numbers of surgeons and specialists in internal medicine. Presence of cardiologists, endocrinologists and orthopedic surgeons is essential.\n\nConsidering high prevalence of respiratory infections during Hajj and their adverse effects on worsening the condition of patients with underlying respiratory pathologies like asthma, it is recommended that use of Influenza vaccine should be mandatory like meningococcal vaccine and not optional. Presence of large number of old aged pilgrims also supports this.\n\nMore emphasis is required on pre-Hajj education of pilgrims and more plantation and shelters at Arafat will be beneficial to counter an expected rise in cases of heat stroke and heat exhaustion in coming years when Hajj will be performed in hotter months.\n\nDistribution of handouts in native languages regarding health tips and how to seek medical help will also help."}
