The red marks in the heat map show that infographics received more attention than the traditional line graphs in all three scenarios (top). The opaque map shows where the participants were looking. The participants rarely paid attention to the line graph compared to the pictures in the infographic (bottom).\n\nMethods-A convergent parallel mixed method was used to evaluate nurses' perceptions on ease of use and usefulness of five visualization conveying trends in hospital infection transmission applying think-aloud, interview, and eye-tracking techniques.\n\nFindings-Subjective data from the interview and think-aloud techniques indicated that participants preferred the traditional line graphs in simple data representation due to their familiarity, clarity, and easiness to read. An objective quantitative measure of eye movement analysis (444,421 gaze events) identified a high degree of participants' attention span in infographics in all three scenarios. All participants responded with the correct answer within 1 min in comprehensive tests.\n\nConclusions-A user-centric approach was effective in developing and evaluating visualizations for hospital infection transmission. For the visualizations designed by the users, the participants were easily able to comprehend the infection visualizations on both line graphs and infographics for simple visualization. The findings from the objective comprehension test and eye movement and subjective attitudes support the feasibility of integrating user-centric visualization designs into electronic health records, which may inspire clinicians to be mindful of hospital infection transmission. Future studies are needed to investigate visualizations and motivation, and the effectiveness of visualization on infection rate.\n\nClinical Relevance-This study designed visualization images using clinical data from electronic health records applying a user-centric approach. The design insights can be applied for visualizing patient data in electronic health records.\n\nElectronic health records; eye tracking; hospital-associated infection; participatory design; usability; visualization Approximately 1 in 25 U.S. hospital patients suffers from a healthcare-associated infection (HAI; Magill et al., 2014) . Healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, comprise the crucial workforce that can help to minimize the transmission of infections (Cimiotti, Aiken, Sloane, & Wu, 2012) . The estimated numbers of common HAI were approximately 93,300 cases of urinary tract infection and 157,500 cases of surgical site infection in 2011 (Magill et al., 2014) . In the recent largest outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in South Korea, Nature reported news on transmission between healthcare workers and patients (Butler, 2015a (Butler, , 2015b , similar to the case of the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during 2002 -2003 (Chau et al., 2008 Cheng, Chan, To, & Yuen, 2013; World Health Organization, 2003) . Visualization techniques using information technology such as infographics may increase awareness and mindfulness among nursing staff of patterns of infectious disease transmission in their workplaces.\n\nVisualization involves visual stimulation with a chart, plot, or diagram, which can vary in size, color, and display platform to represent information or data. One integrated review identified approximately 160 different types of visualization methods, and the preferred type of visualization heavily depends on a specific discipline or work setting (Lengler & Eppler, 2007) . For example, flow charts are frequently used in computer science and engineering, and the three-dimensional (3D) format is commonly used in architecture. In epidemiology, visualization has been used since the 19th century for conveying population-level statistics, communicating new insights and hypotheses, and assisting decision makers. John Snow's visualization of the cholera outbreak demonstrated that the vehicle for spread of the disease was water rather than air (Parkes, 2013) , and Florence Nightingale used visualizations to show that more deaths resulted from contamination in hospitals than from the war (Small, 1998) .\n\nDespite a century of history, the field of visualization is currently fragmented, and wider application of visualization techniques has been constrained by barriers such as lack of organizational support, data access, and usability research (Lengler & Eppler, 2007) . While it is quite feasible for visualization techniques to be incorporated into an electronic health record for improving patient care, it is challenging given the fact that clinicians work under time-pressured environments in hospitals. Visualizations integrated in an electronic health record may not be used effectively among clinicians if visualizations are not evaluated. Further, each clinician has varying visual literacy to interpret the visualizations (Lengler & Eppler, 2007; Matsumoto, Uto, Muranaga, & Kumamoto, 2013) . One solution to these barriers is to apply a participatory approach to design user-centric visualizations (Carroll et al., 2014) , which can help the audience reconstruct and integrate the knowledge and ultimately motivate them to meaningful action (Lengler & Eppler, 2007) . In order to overcome the clinicians' barrier of lack of time when they are provided with infection rate reports, user-centric usability evaluation of the infection rate reports such as measuring time of the cognitive process and cognitive burdens is crucial.\n\nPerceived ease of use and perceived usefulness from Davis' Technology Acceptance Model guided this visualization evaluation study (Davis, 1989 ). Davis' model has been extensively validated in the field of health information technology (HIT) and visualization (Bresciani & Eppler, 2009 ). Perceived ease of use describes the ease with which users understand and learn as well as the aesthetic value of the visualization (e.g., how the space and color help to convey the incidence). Perceived usefulness describes the usefulness by which users grasp complex information containing multiple indicators faster (e.g., how usefully the graph synthesizes several information pieces such as time, incidence, and prevalence with few elements). Perceived usefulness describes the utility by which users may improve their performance by providing immediate insights (e.g., how the graph allows for quick comparisons for decision making to choose Clostridium difficile or ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention education this month).\n\nUsing Davis' Technology Acceptance Model, this study aimed to evaluate among professional nurses the perceived ease of use and usefulness of various types of visualizations that convey information regarding HAI. The research questions were: (a) What are nurses' preferences among various types of visualization to convey information regarding HAI? (b) Which types of visualizations are easy for nurses to understand? (c) Do the participants appropriately identify the meaning of a visualization while they are viewing it? And (d) How long are nurses attentive to visualizations to convey information regarding HAI?\n\nThis evaluation study employed a convergent parallel mixed method and three techniquesinterview, think-aloud, and eye tracking-to evaluate nurses' perceptions of several visualizations to convey information regarding HAI.\n\nThis study was conducted at a school of nursing in an urban research-intensive university in the northeast region of the United States. The visualizations tested were based on actual infection data extracted from electronic health records stored in a research database as part of a larger study (R01 NR010822). Sample size was estimated using the sample size calculator for visualization usability (http://blinkux.com/usability-sample-size/). Twelve participants were required for the study based on the following: number of groups = 1, number of designs = 5, number of designs visible to each user = 5, eye tracking use = qualitative assessment. Eligible participants were master's students with clinical experience at the school of nursing within the institution. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the academic health center.\n\nThis study measured user's cognitive burden while processing visualization information regarding hospital infection rates with the following three measures: (a) user's verbalized preference by an interview, (b) user's comprehension by questionnaires, and (c) objective visual attention. Measuring users' attention via interview, think-aloud, and eye tracking as described later is a common way to assess consumer responses of design in industry and has been found to be feasible and acceptable among healthcare providers (Stephenson, Gold, Mohan, & Gorsuch, 2014) . Operationalization of the concepts of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness for this evaluation study are summarized in Table 1 (available with the online version of this article).\n\nInterview-After each visualization was displayed, participants were asked the following questions: (a) This visualization is about [topic] . What does the visualization tell you? (How does the urinary tract infection [UTI] in room 21 compare to that of other rooms in September?) (b) Which of the visualizations do you prefer and why? (c) What is the most intuitive visualization? And (d) Would this visualization motivate you to address HAI issues? (Which is the most useful visualization? Will the visualization will help me to be aware more quickly of the incidence of UTIs?) See Figure S1 for additional information (available with the online version of this article).\n\nThink-aloud-In order to measure perceived ease of use regarding the visualizations, this study applied concurrent and retrospective think-aloud techniques, which are commonly used in cognitive science, linguistics, and psychology research (Ericsson & Simon, 1993; Nielsen, 1994) . During the concurrent think-aloud (CTA), the data collector encouraged participants to express what they felt and thought while they were viewing visualization (e.g., \"this [visualization] is much better than putting numbers [in the infection report]\"). Once they finished viewing the set of visualizations, the data collector encouraged the participants to articulate their reflections, thoughts, and feelings aloud (retrospective thinkaloud [RTA]; Boren & Ramey, 2000; Dumas & Redish, 1999) . While CTA assesses the spontaneous thought process of human working memory, RTA investigates the thought process relying on a participant's recall memory. CTA slows down the normal viewing process and interferes with the speed of normal thought process, affecting reliability (Hertzum, Hansen, & Andersen, 2009; Jong & Schellens, 2000) . Considering the cognitive burden for nurses in their work environment, CTA and RTA were both applied to comprehensively detect design usability issues of the visualizations.\n\nEye tracking-A Tobii X2 eye tracker (http://www.tobii.com/), a noninvasive tool, was used to measure the speed of eye movement in an unobstructed manner similar to a web camera. The eye tracker measures view sequence, view frequency, and user attention, calculating the velocity of eye movements. The eye tracking software, Tobii Pro StudioTM (http://www.tobii.com/en/eye-tracking-research/global/products/software/tobii-studioanalysis-software/), produces a quantified dataset to export and further analyze using other statistical software (millisecond time units in rows and different measures quantifying eye movement characteristics in columns). Similar to other popular usability evaluation software such as Morae (https://www.techsmith.com/morae.html), Tobii Studio allows voice and screen video recording and provides frames and tools for an investigator to transcribe, comment, code, mark, and organize users' verbal and nonverbal responses. Unlike subjective self-reported data, an eye-tracking technique measures users' attention and response in an objective way by tracking where they look (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v = WCmfVuyImC0). Researchers can benefit from using an eye-tracking technique to collect richer data with complementary objective measures and more data from quiet participants or participants with short memory spans, and issues unnoticed by participants.\n\nAn eye tracker produces milliseconds of characteristics of eye movement with over 100 measures. User eye movements can be used to assess the ease of use and comprehension of the visual stimuli by providing characteristics and patterns of millisecond-eye movement (e.g., fixed eye movement indicating comprehension occurring and rapid eye movement indicating lack of comprehension as well as larger pupil size, which indicates higher attention reflecting ease of use and usefulness of the visualization; Bonhage, Mueller, Friederici, & Fiebach, 2015; Kim, Lombardino, Cowles, & Altmann, 2014; Schumacher et al., 2015) . The eye tracker device collects the spatial position of each eyeball to detect where a participant looks, and the software stores the collected data as numbers, heat maps, and sequence diagrams. In order to calculate the amount of users' attention, the eye tracking measures the frequency and duration of moments when the eye is stable to acquire visual information (fixation and dwell time). Higher frequency and duration of fixation and larger pupil size indicate good attention to a visual stimuli (Wedel & Pieters, 2000) . Fixation (I-VT filter, velocity thresholds 30 degrees/seconds) and dwell time, which is known to be reliable indicators of a person's attention, was used in this study (Fox, Krugman, Fletcher, & Fischer, 1998; Pieters & Wedel, 2007) .\n\nVisual stimuli-Three nurses who had worked at the clinical unit from which the data were extracted and two epidemiologists participated in the design process. Each scenario included one traditional line graph and one or two infographics. The designs were based on three scenarios: Scenario 1 described infections including bloodstream infection, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and surgical site infection in a single room via line graph ( Figure  S2 ) and infographic ( Figure S3 ); Scenario 2 described infections in a unit via line graph ( Figure S4 ), two-dimensional (2D) infographic ( Figure S5 ), and 3D infographic ( Figure S6 ); and Scenario 3 described infections in a unit for 6 years via line graph ( Figure S7 ) and infographic ( Figure S8 & Figure S1 , all Figures available with the online version of this article). The visualizations were designed with incremental complexity in each scenario: infection in a room (Scenario 1), infection in a unit (Scenario 2), and infection in a unit for 6 years (Scenario 3). A total of five designs (Scenario 1: one infographic with body site infection pictograms; Scenario 2: two infographics with different dimensions; Scenario 3: one infographic with microorganism pictograms) representing HAI in a single hospital unit were created using the data extracted from electronic health records within the institution.\n\nFive designs included (a) Infographic 1 using body site pictographs (e.g., urine cups) in Scenario 1 (see Figure S3 ); (b) Infographic 2 using round icons in Scenario 2 (see Figure  S5 ); (c) Infographic 3 using 3D pictographs with radar charts in Scenario 2 (see Figure S6 ); (d) Infographic 4 using microorganism pictograms in Scenario 3 (see Figure S8 ); and (e) line graphs for all scenarios (see Figures S2, S4, S7 ). Each design in Figures S2 through S8 includes different content suggested by the nurses who worked on the unit (user-centric approach). The designs nurses on the unit requested included visualizations of infection in a room where they were in charge, infection in their own unit, and infection of specific microorganisms. The infographics convey content of increasing complexity based on three scenarios, including body site infection rates in a single room (infection in a room), body site infection rates in a unit with multiple rooms (infection in a unit), and infection rates with specific microorganisms over a period of 6 years (infection in a unit for multiple years). Further, the designs contain different graphical components, including dimension (2D and 3D) and variations in pictograms (recognizable and unrecognizable objects to the naked eye). attention measured by objective eye tracker, and preference verbalized by users) when processing information regarding hospital infection rate visualizations. The data collector showed the set of visualizations to the participants repeating three rounds with the following three steps: (a) comprehension, (b) comparison, and (c) reflection section ( Figures S9) . First, the participants were asked to complete the comprehension test questions with three scenarios. In the comparison step, the data collector repeatedly showed the same set of visualizations provided during the first step, and instructed participants to freely and naturally view the designs. While the participants were viewing freely, they were encouraged to verbalize their preference between traditional line graphs and infographics and to compare them. Unlike displaying a single visualization at a time in the Step 1 comprehension test, two or three visualization designs aligned side by side were simultaneously displayed per screen during the Step 2 comparison section to assist participants in comparing the designs. A blank page was provided before and after visualization stimulus to wipe out memory and to reduce eye fatigue during the comparison step. In order to complement qualitative selfreport responses, pupil movement during the comprehension and comparison section was concurrently collected using eye-tracking techniques.\n\nDuring the third step, the data collector showed a video of a screenshot marked with eyetracking results and they were asked to verbalize reflection and additional thoughts regarding whether the visualization could ultimately motivate nurses (see Table 1 ). Time to complete each session ranged from 20 to 30 min. A progressive focusing process (Parlett & Hamilton, 1972) , in which a qualitative analyst interacts with the information and iteratively refines the focus, was applied while data were collected. After obtaining informed consent, verbal feedback was digitally recorded. Participants received no monetary compensation.\n\nNumerical data were descriptively analyzed using R (http://www.r-project.org/) and IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Nonparametric tests including the Wilcoxon signed rank sum test (Hothorn, Hornik, Mavd, & Zeileis, 2015) and Friedman test were applied for comparing the median of the numerical results (Hollander, Wolfe, & Chicken, 2013) of visualizations within each scenario. Data collected from interview and think-aloud protocols were coded and thematically analyzed using Tobii Studio 3.2.3 (www.tobii.com).\n\nThe sample of 12 masters' nursing students with clinical experience was mostly female (n = 11, 92%) and White (n = 8, 67%). Mean interview duration was 20 min per participant (SD 9.2 min). A total of 577,077 events of eye movements of 12 participants (average 48,089 events/participant) were exported from the eye tracker. On average, each participant had 114 instances of eye fixation (SD 61.8, eyes stable to acquire visual information) and 251 instances of rapid eye movement (SD 145.3, eyes unstable) per design. According to the validity score reporting how certain it is that an eye tracker found a specific eye (the lower the value, the more certain the eye tracker is), the measurement validity score of capturing participants' eye movement was high on participants' left eyes (.54) and right eyes (.47) on a 0 to 4 scale (0 = highly confident, 4 = not confident).\n\nScenario 1 (Infection in a Room)-For the comprehension questions (for the line graph, which month had the highest urinary tract infection? for the infographic, which month had the highest bloodstream infection?), all participants promptly recognized the correct answer, with a mean response time of 10.1 s (SD 7.16). In Scenario 1, there was a significant difference (d) in correct response time between the line graph and the infographic for the simple visualization (mean 12.4 \u00b1 8.87 s vs. 7.8 \u00b1 4.13 s, d = 4.61 s, respectively, p = .046). There was a significant difference in correct response time between the line graph and the infographic (mean 37.6 \u00b1 17.68 s vs. 26.2 \u00b1 11.28 s, d = 11.47 s, respectively, p = .01) in Scenario 2.\n\n, what is the most common microorganism in past 6 years? for the infographic, how many patients in 1,000 had Klebsiella infection in 2006 and 2007?-higher difficulty to require calculation of summing up two infection rates), it took an average 11.2 s (SD 9.25) to respond correctly. There was no significant difference in response time (7.7 \u00b1 2.87 s vs. 14.6 \u00b1 12.00 s; p = .99).\n\nIn the gaze analysis recorded by the eye tracker, the participants paid more attention to the infographics than the line graphs in all scenarios. Figure S10 shows a greater degree of participants' attention in red in each infographic compared with the line graphs in all three scenarios. Attention and dwell time measured by the eye tracker are summarized in Table 2 (available with online version of this article). There was a significant difference in total visit duration (line graph 12.3 s vs. infographic 17.9 s, d = 5.58, p = .046) and visit count (line graph 21.8 times vs. infographic 60.5 times, d = 38.63 times, p = .005) between the line graph and the infographic in Scenario 3. There was a significant difference between line graphs and infographics in visit counts among Scenario 2 visualizations (line graph 7.6 times, infographic 2D 9.3 times, infographic 3D 5.1 times, p = .025). There was also a significant difference in participants' pupil size between looking at line graphs and infographics (left eye 3.15 mm vs. 3.22 mm, d = 0.07 mm, p < .001; right eye 3.14 mm vs. 3.22 mm, d = 0.08 mm, p < .001). \n\nTraditional line graphs-During the interview and think-aloud, most participants reported that they preferred the traditional line graph in Scenario 1 due to the line graphs' familiarity, clarity, and ease of reading: \"I am familiar with line graphs\"; \"It naturally draws my attention because I learned those from school; they are easy to read\"; \"It is clear\"; \"I like this; it's easier to follow the trend.\"\n\nWhen multiple rooms were added in the line graph in Scenario 2, the participants verbalized fatigue and difficulty reading the line graphs: \"You can get glassy eyes when you see line graphs over and over again\"; \"I found the linear graphs easy to read but \u2026 they are kind of mashed together; it's difficult to read\"; \"I think looking at one graph is easier to digest than reading 30 graphs \u2026 you need to aggregate them.\"\n\nIn Scenario 3 where the designs depicted the rate of specific infections over time using two methods-line graph and infographics with microorganisms pictures-the participants reported that the line graph was aesthetically less attractive than the infographics, but easy to read, easy to understand, and useful to process information efficiently: \"This one [line graph] is so easy to understand, the Staphylococcus is really high, but I like seeing the images of bacteria, microorganisms\"; \"I like this one [line graph] better even though this one [infographic] is more attractive\"; \"This [line graph] shows me quickly that Staphylococcus is more prevalent \u2026 eyes go straight to the high number.\"\n\nInfographics-In certain situations in Scenario 1, the participants preferred the infographics because they used a pictogram: \"The pictures make clearer where you are looking at so you don't have to keep tracking back to the graph key like \u2026 oh, wait! Which line is this, which line is that?\"; \"This [infographic] is really easy to see. I don't even necessarily need to know what the key is\"; \"I know what I am looking for-urinary tract infection versus bloodstream infection (without seeing the keys).\"\n\nWhen multiple rooms were added in Scenario 2, the participants expressed their preference for the 2D infographics with round circles since their aesthetic value (simplicity and clarity) helps the participants learn and understand information easily: \"It's all separated and you can clearly see the incidence of infection so this [2D infographic] is the best. It's more understandable\"; \"Round is creative and innovative, not difficult to read\"; \"The circular bubble, it just stands out clearly and nicely when there are large number of diseases \u2026 because I am looking at so many rooms.\"\n\nIn some cases in Scenario 2, the participants preferred 3D infographics containing a room layout due to their detailed information, aesthetic values, innovativeness, and relevance to their daily work lives: \"When we consider cross-contamination and cross-infection among the rooms, this [3D infographic] is much better because it provides spatial information\"; \"I prefer the 3D graph. This is for the nurses who want to know the detailed information (i.e., learnability), who want to read more and to do research\"; \"That [3D infographic] will be great for somebody on the floor who is very familiar with that floor. I think that's more powerful than other graphs.\"\n\nIn Scenario 3, which represented infection in a unit over 6 years, most participants liked both visualizations equally. In some cases, the participants found the infographic to be visually superior, insightful, and easier to understand than the line graph: \"Both are clear; this one [infographic] is more visually interesting, and it's easy to read\"; \"Both are really great; actually I like them both \u2026 [line graph] it's so obvious, you just look at the highest in the line graph, but this [infographic] is better because the numbers are directly next to it with the size of the human\"; \"I like the one with the pictures; I like how the incidence is clearly numbered and sized \u2026 I like seeing the images of bacteria and microorganisms\"; \"I really like this one [infographic] . A person is larger with a higher number of people infected. For the line graph, if you look at quickly, it's a little harder, less intuitive to read-you have to read all the numbers below [in x-axis], even though you did a great job in the line graph.\"\n\nThis study evaluated the ease of use and usefulness of visualizations conveying infection transmission in a large urban hospital. In order to achieve user-centric design (Carroll et al., 2014) , this study applied a participatory approach in the design process of visualizing data extracted from electronic health records and conducted a usability test using mixed methods. The study findings provide insights for designing visualizations of hospital infection transmission and ultimately contribute to motivating nurses and creating a culture for a usercentric approach in hospital infection prevention. This study has substantive and methodological implications for user-centric visualizations in a hospital.\n\nMany nurses in the past decade have been resistant to and frustrated with poorly designed electronic health records because they had to adopt them without providing any input (Ajami & Bagheri-Tadi, 2013) . The study findings of the users' positive attitudes and immediate understanding of the visualizations support the feasibility of integrating infection visualization into electronic health records when this study applied a user-centric design approach. Innovative visualizations conveying infection transmission designed by their peers may be positively adopted by nurses who work under time-pressured environments in a hospital to integrate hospital infection knowledge and ultimately motivate them to be mindful of the need for prevention efforts.\n\nIn terms of visualization detail, most participants preferred the traditional line graphs to infographics for simple data representation in Scenario 1 conveying monthly infection rates in a room. During the interview and think-aloud (CTA), participants spontaneously verbalized the reasons, such as line graphs are familiar, clear, and easy to read. The preference of line graphs may be explained by their routine use in patient records (Lengler & Eppler, 2007) . Regardless of the platform of display, whether paper or electronic records, line graphs have been heavily used for decades to represent patient vital signs, including blood pressure and heart rate (Tague, Maeder, & Nguyen, 2010) . The study finding implies that the line graphs are a suitable choice for simple data representation in infection transmission due to their familiarity, clarity, and ease of reading.\n\nWhile traditional line graphs were well received for simple data representation during CTA, the line graphs were perceived as less useful and difficult to read for complex data representation, mostly during RTA. When multiple rooms were added in Scenario 2, the participants preferred the clarity, learnability, usefulness, and simplicity of infographics. Further, the participants paid more attention to infographics due to aesthetic values, innovativeness, and creativeness. The participants were attracted to the highly contextualized pictograms, implying that those pictures may help cognitive processing to ultimately motivate their behaviors.\n\nIn terms of methodological implications, this study contributes to the field of usability evaluation. A single subjective method such as interview, survey, or focus group without objective eye tracking has been used in a conventional usability test in health information technology. However, the evaluation process in this study included three steps (Step 1, comprehension test;\n\nStep 2, step-comparison; and\n\nStep 3, step-reflection) using multiple techniques to thoroughly understand complex human visualization interaction behavior. This study found contradictory results between objective and subjective data in Scenarios 1 and 3. While most participants preferred the line graphs during the interview, they paid more attention to the infographics (seen in red in the heat maps from eye tracking). There are multiple reasons for being highly attentive on the infographics. The attention was not because of the difficulty of processing the information of the infographics in Scenario 1 as it took significantly less time to comprehend information of the infographics than the line graphs. This implies that objective eye-tracking methods may provide a deeper understanding of human visualization interaction behavior than a conventional interview or think-aloud method. A single method to evaluate usability of visualization should be avoided. Nurses, who are the main user, have rarely been included in usability evaluation of electronic health records. This study introduced a method to collect nurses' voices objectively and subjectively in usability evaluation of electronic health records.\n\nAccording to Davis' theory (Davis, 1989) , if a nurse perceives a visualization to be useful and easy to understand, the nurse will change her or his attitude toward using the visualization and actual use behaviors. In this study, the users are likely to use the infection visualization designed according to user-centric design principle. However, the extent to which actual infection prevention behaviors might be affected is not known.\n\nThe generalizability of this study is limited due to using a sample population of nurses in a master's program in a single urban university. The levels of visual literacy, cognitive abilities, and learning types may differ between master's students and the general nursing workforce in a hospital. Further, visualizations are intended to target workplaces, but this study was conducted in a laboratory-based environment. Because there might be gender differences in processing information in the form of visualizations, future studies with larger numbers of men as well as women are warranted (Feingold, 1988; Kaufman, 2007; Maeda & Yoon, 2013) . Studies of real-world based settings and ethnographic studies in the field are needed to reveal barriers in workplace environments. Though the participants expressed overall satisfaction, a few minor issues with color choices and the size of the infographics used were encountered, which may warrant revisiting.\n\nA user-centric approach was effective in developing and evaluating visualizations for hospital infection transmission. According to the subjective findings in this study, most participants preferred traditional line graphs for the simple visualization, and expressed fatigue in reading the line graphs for the complex visualization. Infographics representing large amounts of information received positive feedback on their clarity, learnability, and aesthetic values of using relevant context pictograms from the users and warrants future cognitive usability research. The objective measures using eye tracking and a comprehension test identified that the infographics in all three scenarios received more attention than the traditional line graphs. The objective and subjective data in this study support the feasibility of integrating user-centric design of infection transmission visualization into electronic health records. Visualizations may inspire clinicians to be mindful of hospital infection transmission. The authors recommend that user-centric design with visualizations and usercentric usability evaluations be considered to improve data representation and facilitate rapid clinician comprehension in electronic health records in general."}
