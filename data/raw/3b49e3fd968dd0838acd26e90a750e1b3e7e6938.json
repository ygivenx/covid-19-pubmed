{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Recommendations and guidance for providing pharmaceutical care services during COVID-19 pandemic: A China perspective Recommendations and Guidance for Providing Pharmaceutical Care Services during COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Community Pharmacists", "body": "departments located in primary care institutions only, such as community health service centers 62 and community outpatient clinics. They follow the regulations of local and national government, 63 and provide prescription medications dispensing service and other pharmacy-related services. 64\n\nRetail pharmacies in China provide some prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, 65 supplements, and health-related products and devices for sale. They are not considered part of 66 the healthcare system as they practice follow different companies' regulations. The professional 67 skills of pharmacy staff and pharmacists work in these retail pharmacies varies significantly, and 68 are generally not considered as healthcare professionals [4] . 69\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the need of PC services is beyond the scope of traditional 71 practice of community pharmacists, which can be divided into two parts: the need of pandemic 72 prevention and control and the need from patients of pharmacy-related issues. To promote the 73 pandemic control, community patients need to be screened properly and suspected patients shall 74 be referred to designated medical institutions in a timely manner [5] . The public also need to 75 master effective personal protection skills to control the community transmission of COVID-19 76 [2, [6] [7] . Patients on medical isolated observation or patients with mild COVID-19 on treatment at 77 home are lacking guidance on home care strategies [8] . 78\n\nThe pharmacy-related needs of community patients have similarities with the traditional patient 79 population, but with different emphasis. For example, when providing consulting services to 80 community patients, instead of focusing on medications as usual, their questions are mainly on 81 the scientific prevention knowledge and basic information about COVID-19, such as mask 82 selection and typical signs and symptoms of COVID-19. For chronic disease patients, especially 83 those in communities under quarantine, drug supply and patients' compliance are facing a greater 84 challenge, though the safety and effectiveness of treatment is also important for this patient 85 population. Thus, community pharmacists shall learn to switch gears when needed from 86 providing professional knowledge on medication use only to fulfilling community patients' 87 various needs. 88\n\ncontrol 90\n\nSince the concept of PC being defined in the 1990s, the scope of pharmacy practice has 91 expanded from medication dispensing to a variety of clinical services [9] . Community infection control and prevention, promoting cardiovascular disease control, prevention and 97 management of drug abuse, misuse and addiction [10] . 98\n\nThe community pharmacy practice in China has developed rapidly since the 21 st century with the 99 progress of national healthcare reformation. Pharmaceutical services including chronic disease 100 management, patient education and consulting, scientific knowledge popularization in 101 communities are provided in most of the community pharmacies in China in addition to drug 102 dispensing. Although gap still exists between the PC services being provided in China and some 103 developed countries, the experience Chinese community pharmacists gained during the 104 COVID-19 outbreak is of great value for community pharmacies around the world for the 105 following three reasons. 106\n\nFirst, the current model of PC practice in China is similar to the model in foreign countries, from 107 the services being provided to the content and actual procedure of each service. So the Chinese 108 experience shall also be applicable to other countries. Secondly, the need of pharmaceutical care 109\n\nis different from what's been provided in traditional pharmacy practice, as discussed in section 110 1.2, and learning the experience Chinese community pharmacists gained through real practice is 111 crucial for those who will be facing this pandemic. Last but not the least, during this pandemic, 112 pharmacists in China used a variety of approaches, such as mobile APPs and collaborating with 113 neighborhood committees and drug companies, to provide consulting services online and ensure 114 patients' drug supply at home. These approaches can also be applied in other countries as new 115 strategies to provide PC and can potentially create new forms of pharmacy service in the future. 116\n\nIn this section, we aim to provide reference for pharmacy management teams from an 118 administrative perspective and for community pharmacists from a clinical perspective based on 119 the previous analysis. 120\n\nThe community pharmacy management team shall actively adjust their operation process 122 according to the characteristics of COVID-19 pandemic and related patients' need during home 123 quarantine. In this section, we aim to provide guidance on how to get prepared for providing PC 124 services from a pharmacy administration perspective. 125\n\nDuring the pandemic, the public mostly rely on community pharmacies to get adequate supply of supply the demand\", as suggested in FIP's \"Information and interim guidelines for pharmacists 130 and the pharmacy workforce\" for COVID-19 outbreak [2] . Medications and COVID-19 131 preventative products are essential for community patients' chronic disease management and 132 control of the pandemic. Thus, pharmacy management teams shall make ensuring their supply a 133 priority when getting prepared for and during the pandemic. workflows in face of the COVID-19 pandemic and create emergency plans or protocols on the populations, such as patient screening and referral criteria, methods for effective self-protection 165 [15] , counseling points of related medications, chronic disease management of the elderly [16] , 166 home care [8] , psychological support [17] , and so on. Adequate training of pharmacists is essential 167 for the successful delivery of PC services. with key words. In this section, we will discuss the content that needs to be included in these six 195 domains in detail.\n\npharmacists shall pay extra attention to patient's self-protection and emotional situation 199 (discussed in (6)). For example, pharmacists can check if the patient is wearing mask or 200 performing respiratory hygiene properly. Pharmacists shall be readily available to provide 201 consultation on proper self-protection skills or psychological support for these identified patients 202 as discussed in (4) for COVID-19 patients discharged from medical institutions as they still have compromised 215 immunity [3] . Pharmacists can offer medication reconciliation, consultation and home care 216 guidance (as discussed in (5)) for these patients to support their recovery at home. 217\n\nRefer to CDC website for criteria on patient evaluation and the FIP interim guideline for more 218 guidance on isolation and referral practice when suspected patients are identified at the pharmacy 219 [2, 5] . 220\n\n(2) Chronic disease management [16] including the suspected patients' tableware and articles for daily use (see Appendix 1 for a 288 sample checklist of environmental conditions [18] ). Ensure that all isolated patients and related 289 family members are aware of the significance of scientific prevention, and are able to master 290 such skills. 291 (6) Psychological support [17] 292\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and the sudden change of routine daily life, together with the fear or 293 concern of being infected by the SARS-CoV-2 from anyone at anytime may lead to emotional 294 problems in some community patients. During the interaction and communication with patients, 295 pharmacy staff shall pay attention to their emotional or psychological conditions, and identify 296 patients with excessive anxiety, concern, fear or blind optimism. For such patients, psychological 297 or emotional support shall be provided. If the patient is considered having a psychological problem that needs assessment or treatment, referral to psychiatrist shall be made. Additionally, 299 to promote patient's mental health during the pandemic, pharmacists shall aid the community 300 patient population to understand the COVID-19 pandemic situation properly, and adjust their 301 psychological state and recognition to view things from positive perspectives. Encourage the 302 public to maintain regular work and rest schedule with adequate exercise to enhance the 303 immunity system and relieve negative emotions at the same time. 304\n\nCommunity pharmaceutical care services during the COVID-19 outbreak shall possess different 306\n\nproperties due to disease characteristics and related change in patients' need. Community 307 pharmacies shall work as a strong supporter of patient's medication and protective equipment 308\n\nsupply. Community pharmacists shall be prepared to provide skilled and effective PC services 309\n\nfor community patient population to ensure medication safety and promote the overall 310 COVID-19 pandemic control. 311 312 support to this article.
