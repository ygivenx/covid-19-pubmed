{"title": "", "body": "The indirect fluorescence antibody (IFA) test is a recognized, sensitive method to detect antibody to specific rodent viruses. One method used for the detection of coronaviral antibodies in rodent sera consists of equal proportions of cells infected with the JHM and S strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as a source of antigen, together with uninfected cells. Using this as a source of antigen, the indirect fluorescent antibody procedure has proven to be a test system with D.H. Percy et al. good sensitivity for the detection of animals seropositive for routine coronaviruses [6] . Similarly, enzyme i m m u n o a s s a y (EIA) procedures have been developed for antibody detection and titration. Using the horseradish peroxidase or the urease assay, antibody titers m a y be substantially higher than those detected with the I F A technique [7] .\n\nUsing the L-2 subline of L-929 cells, we have been able to replicate relatively high titers of sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) [4] , and Parker's rat coronavirus (PRC) [5] in vitro. The purpose of this study was to compare the sensitivity of SDAV or PRC-infected L-2 cells with MHV-infected cells for the detection and titration of antibody to S D A V or PRC. The techniques used were I F A and an i m m u n o e n z y m e procedure.\n\nThe L-2 subline of L-929 cells for the replication of SDAV or PRC was obtained from Dr. V. L. Morris, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario. MHV-infected NCTC 1469 cells, prepared as previously described for L-929 cells [6] were acquired from Dr. A. L. Smith, Section of Comparative Medicine, Yale School of Medicine.\n\nThe #681 strain of SDAV (family Coronaviridae) was obtained from Dr. P. N. Bhatt, Yale School of Medicine. The isolate of PRC (family Coronaviridae) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD. SDAV and PRC were replicated in L-2 cells as previously described [4, 5] . For the preparation of viral antigen from rat coronaviruses, L-2 cells were propagated in 100 x 15 mm Nunc polystyrene tissue culture dishes (Gibco/BRL Inc, Burlington, Ont.) in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Gibco/BRL Inc). Cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. When approximately 80% confluent, monolayers were inoculated with stock virus suspension, and incubated for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. Infected and control cells were then removed using a rubber policeman, placed in two separate centrifuge tubes, and centrifuged at 1600rpm, then resuspended in PBS. Cells were then mixed at one part of infected to 1.5 parts of noninfected cells. 20 gl of the mixture were then dropped on each well in multiwell depression glass slides (Gibco/BRL Inc). Slides were air dried for 1 h, fixed in acetone, and stored at -7 0 \u00b0C until tested.\n\nSPF Wistar rats were obtained at approximately 8 weeks of age from a commercial supplier (Charles River Laboratories, St. Constant, Quebec). Animals were housed in an isolation facility throughout the inoculation period. In separate studies and at different time periods, rats were inoculated intranasally with approximately 103 TCIDs0 of either the ATCC strain of PRC or strain #681 of SDAV (second passage in L-2 cells). Animals were killed with an overdose of pentobarbitone sodium (MTC Pharmaceuticals, Mississauga, Ont.) at 6, 8, 14, and 21 days post-inoculation (pi), sera were collected by cardiac puncture, and tissues were collected from control and inoculated animals for histopathology.\n\nSera were tested for antibody titers using the following virus-infected cells as antigens: SDAV, PRC, and MHV. Serum samples were diluted in PBS, then individual wells were flooded with the appropriate dilution and processed as previously described [6] . Fluorescein-labelled anti-rat globulin (Antibodies Inc., Davis, CA) was used to identify positive samples. Evans blue at 0.005% was used as a counterstain. Specimens were examined using a halogen-illuminated epifluorescence microscope at x 250 and x 400 magnifications. All samples were read as unknowns to avoid bias. Titers were recorded as the highest dilution of the serum sample under test showing fluorescence. The differences between the mean values for the antibody titers to the homologous and heterologous viruses in each study were tested for significance using the general linear model of SAS (GLM).\n\nFor the immunoenzyme technique, sera collected from spontaneous cases of SDA were used to evaluate the sensitivity of MHV and SDAV-infected cells for antibody titration. The procedure, using horse radish peroxidase-conjugate anti-rat IgG, has been previously described [-7] .\n\nTypical changes [2, 8] cells (Fig. 1 a) . With L-2 cells inoculated with P R C and prepared for the I F A techniqe, cytoplasmic fluorescence was present most frequently in single or binucleated cells (Fig. 1 b) .\n\nUsing the I F A procedure and MHV-, SDAV-, or PRC-infected cells as a source of antigen and sera from rats exposed to S D A virus, antibody titers to all three antigens were similar (Table 1 ). There was no statistically-significant difference in antibody titers to the three antigens (p <0.0001). Similarly, in a comparison of antibody titers in rats inoculated with PRC, antibody titers were similar ( Table 2 ). There was no significant difference in the m e a n antibody titers to the homologous virus c o m p a r e d to the heterologous viral antigens (p < 0.0001).\n\nUsing MHV-infected N C T C cells and SDAV-infected L-2 cells as the source of antigen, serum antibody titers of SDAV-infected rats were usually substantially higher with homologous antigen than with the MHV-infected cells (Table 3 ).

The antigenic similarities among the rodent coronaviruses have been emphasized in previous studies [1, 3], thus allowing the use of MHV-infected cells as a source of antigen for the detection of antibodies to either mouse or rat coronaviruses [6] . Based on our studies, the use of rat coronavirus-infected cells as a source of antigen offers no significant advantage over MHV-infected cells. Furthermore, we were unable to demonstrate any appreciable advantage in using either SDAV or PRC as a source of viral antigen to detect antibody to the homologous virus, either in sensitivity or specificity. Based on these data, there is no evidence that IFA staining of L-2 cells infected with either SDAV or PRC will serve to differentiate antibody to the homologous or heterologous virus. However, using M H V or SDAV-infected cells as a source of antigen for the enzyme immunoassay procedure, there was a significant difference in the anti-SDAV antibody titers using the homologous virus (p < 0.0046). SDA antibody titers were usually considerably higher using the enzyme immunoassay procedure with homologous antigen than with MHV-infected cells."}
