Sputum was diluted with an equal volume of distilled water and vortexed before extraction. RSV RNA was detected using real-time multiplex RT-PCR to identify RSV A or B infections. 17 A quantitative RT-PCR for RSV A was performed using a published assay and modifi ed for group B RSV using a different reverse primer (5 9 TCCTCTATCAGTCCTTGTT). 18 A standard curve was run for each assay using 10-fold dilutions of stock RSV A2 and B1 (10 6 plaque-forming units/mL) and cyclic threshold values for samples converted to PFU per mL equivalents.\n\nSerum IgG and Nasal IgA Enzyme Immunoassay and Serum Neutralization Assay: The titer of serum IgG and nasal IgA to purifi ed RSV F and G glycoproteins was determined using established methods. 19 Nasal titers were standardized to a total protein of 100 m g/mL of nasal secretion. Neutralization titers were determined by a microneutralization assay as previously published. 19 Cytokine Assays Serum: Levels of IL-6 were measured using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay (Biosource; Camarillo, California). The range of detection for IL-6 is 0.16 to 10 pg/mL. Nasal Samples: IL-6, IL-8, and MIP-1 a levels were measured using commercial enzyme immunoassay kits (Biosource). Cytokine results were corrected to 100 m g/mL of total protein.\n\nPolychromatic Flow Cytometry: Fresh PBMCs from whole blood were stained using the following antibody panel to identify T-cell subsets: FITC-CD45RO, PE-CD28, Pacifi c Blue-CD3, APC-CD16 (BioLegend; San Diego, California ); PE-Texas Red-CD8, PE-Cy5.5-CD4 (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, California); PE-Cy7-CD56, Alexa Fluor700-CD14, APC-Cy7-CD19 (BD Biosciences; San Jose, California); and B cell subsets: FITC-IgD, PE-IgG, PE-Cy5-IgM, PE-Cy7-B220, Alexa Fluor700-CD14, APC-Cy7-CD19 (BD Biosciences); Pacifi c-Blue-CD38 (Sanz Laboratory; Rochester, New York); APC-CD27 (BioLegend); and PE-Cy5.5-CD3 (Invitrogen). Cells were collected on an LSRII instrument (BD Biosciences) confi gured to detect 11 fl uorochromes. One to 2 million events were collected per sample. Analysis was performed using FlowJo software (Treestar, Inc; version 8.8.6). Total PBMC were gated on lymphocytes and monocytes using forward scatter and sideways scatter . To exclude nonspecifi c staining of B and T cells, CD14 and CD3 or CD14 and CD19 were used, respectively.\n\nDifferences in categorical and continuous distributions were evaluated by Fisher exact and Student t tests, respectively. Two-tailed Mann-Whitney (nonparametric) was used to compare the nonsteroid-and steroid-treated fl ow data.\n\nOverall, 111 subjects were identifi ed as RSV-infected by RT-PCR and agreed to participate in the study. Of these, 50 were hospitalized and 61 were treated as outpatients. Thirty-three of 50 inpatients (66%) received at least 1 day of systemic corticosteroids compared with three of 61 (5%) outpatients. The analysis of immunologic and virologic changes associated with systemic corticosteroid use was restricted effects on adaptive immunity, glucose control, bone metabolism, and other organ systems. [5] [6] [7] [8] Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common winter virus that infects persons of all ages and is associated with wheezing, especially in young children. 9 In children with RSV-related bronchiolitis and wheezing, systemic corticosteroids have been studied and found to provide no signifi cant clinical benefi t. [10] [11] [12] In adults, the virus has been implicated as a cause of COPD and asthma exacerbations, yet is rarely specifi cally diagnosed in clinical practice. [13] [14] [15] Because wheezing is associated with the infection, systemic corticosteroids are commonly prescribed. 16 However, the effects of short-term high-dose steroid treatment on viral load and adaptive immunity to a specifi c virus during acute infection have never been examined. Therefore, we took advantage of an ongoing study of the pathogenesis of RSV disease in adults to address these issues.\n\nThe study was conducted during three consecutive winters between 2005 and 2008 at Rochester General Hospital in Rochester, New York. Hospitalized patients with diagnoses of upper respiratory infection, bronchitis, pneumonia, COPD, asthma, viral illness, or respiratory failure were evaluated within 48 h of admission. All participants or guardians provided informed consent. The University of Rochester Research Subjects Review Board and the Rochester General Hospital Clinical Investigation Committee approved the study.\n\nNasal samples were obtained from all participants by rubbing the nasal turbinates for 5 s with a cotton swab. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasal samples was performed within 24 h of collection. Study subjects who tested positive for RSV were visited daily. Expectorated sputum and endotracheal aspirated secretions were obtained if possible; however, sputum was not induced. Respiratory samples were collected daily for the fi rst 7 days of illness and every other day thereafter until testing negative by RT-PCR on two consecutive samples. Nasal samples were also collected at days 8 to 14 and at 1 month. Whole blood and serum were collected at the time RSV was fi rst identifi ed, at days 8 to 14, and at 1 month after symptom onset. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from whole blood.\n\nEvaluations consisted of a medical history, chart review, and physical examination. Steroid use prior to admission and the timing and dose of steroid administration during hospitalization were recorded. Subjects underwent daily clinical assessments while hospitalized and were reevaluated at 1 month.\n\nReverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction: RNA was extracted into 12 m L of water from 250 m L of respiratory speci-pared with those not treated (5.4 \u03ee 8.5 vs 17.2 \u03ee 34.4, P 5 .08). Of note, blood samples were collected on average 2 days after steroids were begun. By day 28, serum IL-6 levels were similar in both groups.\n\nRSV-specifi c serum and nasal antibody titers measured at the time of enrollment were not significantly different between groups. Serum and nasal antibody responses to RSV infection were slightly blunted in the steroid-treated group ( Figs 2A, 2B ) with convalescent titers approximately twofold lower compared with the untreated group. However, only serum-neutralizing antibody responses to group A virus ( P 5 .05) and nasal IgA to the fusion protein ( P 5 .01) were signifi cantly lower.\n\nTwenty-nine randomly selected subjects (16 steroid treated and 13 untreated) had T and B lymphocyte subpopulations analyzed at three time points: acute ( \u202b\u0641\u202c 36-48 h after initiating steroids), day 12 to 14, and to the hospitalized cohort to provide more balanced illness severity in the comparison groups. Although a variety of steroid regimens were prescribed, most patients received 4 to 10 mg of dexamethasone or 40 to 60 mg of methylprednisolone every 6 h for 1 to 2 days followed by an oral prednisone taper. The mean duration of steroid therapy was 11.3 \u03ee 7.3 days with a range from 1 to 27 days. Five subjects received 2 or fewer days of corticosteroid treatment. Seven subjects were taking oral corticosteroids prior to admission, and all were given IV corticosteroids or higher doses of oral prednisone treatment while hospitalized.\n\nPredictably, the clinical features of the subjects who received corticosteroids were different from those who were not treated ( Table 1 ) . Although most differences did not achieve statistical signifi cance, those given steroids in the hospital were more often men with a history of COPD and were receiving oral steroids and supplemental oxygen prior to admission. The presence of diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease was slightly more common among those not treated with corticosteroids. Admitting diagnoses were similar between the two groups, although COPD exacerbation was most common among those treated with steroids, and a diagnosis of pneumonia was the leading diagnosis for those not treated. Wheezing at the time of admission was more common in the steroid group, whereas the patients not treated with steroids patients were more often febrile. Although not signifi cantly different, there was a trend toward higher rates of infi ltrates on chest radiographs and mean peripheral WBC counts in those not treated with steroids.\n\nOverall, the hospital course for patients who received corticosteroids was similar to those who were not treated ( Table 2 ). Rates of respiratory failure, intensive care admission, and in-hospital mortality were not signifi cantly different. Two patients in the steroidtreated group died, and in both cases patients were placed on hospice care because of longstanding severe COPD. No patients developed nosocomial bacterial infections, and there were no overt complications related to steroid treatment, such as psychosis or severe glucose dysregulation. Although the mean last days of reported wheezing or dyspnea were significantly longer in the steroid-treated group compared with those not treated, the length of hospital stay and illness duration were not signifi cantly different.\n\nGroup A and B viruses were evenly distributed in those treated with steroids vs those who were not treated. Viral shedding was not prolonged, nor was the mean viral load higher in the steroid-treated group ( Figs 1A, 1B ) . Infl ammatory mediators were measured in nasal samples at enrollment, day 12, and day 28 and were not consistently different in either group ( Table 3 ) . There was a trend toward lower acute serum IL-6 levels in patients treated with steroids com- between days 2 and 6, and 1.2 \u03ee 0.4 3 10 3 / m L after day 9. Representative fl ow cytometry results are shown in Figures 3 and 4 for a random subset of 35 and 23 patients for T-and B-cell panels, respectively, at the mid time point (day [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Analysis of early and late testing demonstrated similar fi ndings in B-and T-cell subsets (data not shown). A representative sample of B-and T-cell subsets is shown in e- Figure 1A and 1B. No signifi cant differences between steroidtreated and steroid-untreated subjects at any of the time points were noted regarding the total percentage of B cells (% CD19 1 ), CD27 1 memory B cells, antibody secreting cells (ASC), or plasmablasts ( Fig 3 ) . Additionally, there were no signifi cant differences in the fraction of CD3 1 T cells, monocytes, CD4 and CD8 T cells (naive and memory), and natural killer cells (subsets of CD56 1 CD16hi and CD56hi) ( Fig 4 ) .\n\nIn our study of patients hospitalized with RSVrelated respiratory illness, short-term systemic corticosteroids were not associated with signifi cant adverse clinical or virologic outcomes. No episodes of severe hyperglycemia, avascular bone necrosis, or steroidinduced psychosis were observed during the hospitalization or 1-month follow-up period. However, it is important to note that our study was not powered to detect important clinical steroid-related adverse events. Given the importance of cellular immunity for viral clearance and the recognized effects of longterm steroid use, we were surprised that peak RSV viral loads and duration of viral shedding were not increased in the steroid-treated group. 20 This fi nding may refl ect the relatively brief course of systemic steroids received by study participants. Although steroids exert an antiinfl ammatory effect, no uniform trend was detected in serum or nasal cytokine levels in patients receiving steroids.\n\nThe complex quantitative and qualitative effects of systemic glucocorticosteroids on the host immune response are well described. 21 Nearly every type of immune cell, including B and T lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes, are affected. A substantial reduction in circulating lymphocytes can be demonstrated almost immediately upon injection of hydrocortisone in animal studies, with no further effect of increased dose or duration . 22 Lymphopenia is reversible but lasts throughout the period of exposure. Steroids also inhibit T-cell activation, lymphocyte proliferation, and T helper 1/T helper 2 regulation. 21 Given the known effects of steroids on the immune system, the lack of signifi cant differences in lymphocyte numbers and subsets in our steroid-treated subjects day 28 post illness. Admission absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) prior to steroid administration were similar (1.1 \u03ee 0.5 3 10 3 / m L vs 1.2 \u03ee 0.7 3 10 3 / m L) in the steroid-treated and -untreated groups, respectively. Notably, 31% of the steroid-treated group (of whom two were receiving steroids prior to admission) and 46% of the untreated group had an ALC of , 1.0 3 10 3 / m L at presentation to the hospital. For those receiving steroids who had repeat measurements, the mean ALC was 0.8 \u03ee 0.5 3 10 3 / m L at 24 h, 1.2 \u03ee 0.7 3 10 3 / m L may have been preferentially affected by steroid administration. Our study is limited by the small sample size, the lack of randomization, and the restriction to one type of viral infection. Because steroids were more commonly used in patients with COPD, which is an infl ammatory condition, the effects of steroids on infl ammatory markers and immune function may have been diffi cult to discern given the unequal distribution of patients with COPD in the analysis groups. Although it is reasonable to presume steroid effects would be similar for other respiratory viruses, RSV has unique immunomodulatory effects, and, therefore, our fi ndings may not be broadly applicable. [26] [27] [28] In conclusion, a short course of systemic corticosteroids in patients hospitalized with acute RSV infection was not associated with major deleterious is puzzling. However, very few data are available on the immune affects of steroids in acutely ill patients, particularly those with viral infections. Lymphopenia is associated with a number of acute viral infections, such as infl uenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 23, 24 It is noteworthy that many of the patients in this study were lymphopenic at the time of presentation, and thus it is possible that RSV infection induces signifi cant immunologic perturbations that may complicate interpretation of a steroid effect.\n\nThe primary adverse effect of steroid use appeared to be a modestly diminished serum and secretory antibody response. Although differences were only statistically signifi cant in serum-neutralizing titers against group A virus and nasal antibody to the F protein, it is likely that a larger sample size would have yielded signifi cant differences in other parameters as well. High levels of serum and nasal RSV antibody have been shown to be protective from infection and severe disease in adults, although a specifi c protective antibody titer is not known. 19, 25 Therefore, lower postinfection titers may leave steroid-treated patients more susceptible to future RSV exposures. However, the absolute differences in postinfection antibody titers we observed were relatively small, making the clinical implications of these fi ndings uncertain. The diminished antibody response in the steroid group was not explained by a signifi cant reduction in the number of B lymphocytes, ASCs, or CD4 1 T-cell lymphocytes. However, it is possible that function or activation was impaired despite no discernible difference in cell numbers or subsets. In addition, we did not measure RSV-specifi c T-cell responses or ASC, which side effects. Since specifi c respiratory viral infections, with the exception of infl uenza, are rarely diagnosed in adults, and steroids are commonly prescribed for acute exacerbations of COPD, these data are reassur-ing. A modestly diminished humoral response may predispose patients to future RSV infections, but this risk must be balanced with the immediate antiinfl ammatory effects and potential clinical benefi ts."}
