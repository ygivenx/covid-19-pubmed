{"title": "Bat immunology takes off", "body": "Bats are reservoirs for many deadly viral infections, including Ebola and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). However, bats themselves do not usually succumb to these infections. By describing the whole genomes of two distantly related bat species (Pteropus alecto and Myotis davidii), this study provides insight into why bats tolerate viruses that are deadly to humans. Comparing bat genomes with those of other mammalian species, the authors found that gene variants associated with DNA damage\u2013repair responses and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signalling have been positively selected for in bats. Bats are the only mammals capable of sustained flight, a process that requires high metabolic activity and leads to the generation of dangerous by-products such as reactive oxygen species. The authors propose that the evolution of flight led to the selection of genes that promote damage sensing and repair, many of which also contribute to antiviral immunity. They suggest that flight-associated adaptations inadvertently shaped the bat immune system."}
