{"title": "Outcomes of severe human metapneumovirus-associated community- acquired pneumonia in adults", "body": "Since the first discovery of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) from young children in 2001 [1] , HMPV has been recognized as an important agent of upper and lower respiratory tract disease worldwide. Although HMPV infection is regarded as generally mild and self-limiting in adults, it is gaining increased attention as the cause of severe pneumonia [2] [3] [4] . However, few investigators have addressed the outcomes\n\nWe aimed to investigate the incidence and outcomes of adult patients with severe HMPV-associated CAP and to compare them with those of patients with severe IFV-associated CAP.\n\nThis study is a part of an ongoing prospective observational cohort study in the 28-bed medical ICU of Asan Medical Center, a 2,700-bed university-affiliated tertiary care hospital in Seoul, Korea [7, 8] . All patients aged \u226516 years admitted to the medical ICU with severe CAP from March 2010 to August 2017 were included. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center. Using a standardized protocol, investigators prospectively collected detailed data on demographics, comorbidities, medications, clinical and laboratory findings, the severity of illness score, management, and outcome information. The microbiological evaluation was performed as described previously [7, 8] : respiratory viruses were identified from nasopharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates, and bronchoscopic lavage (BAL) fluids, and the microorganisms identified from specimens collected \u2264 72 h after hospital admission were considered CAP pathogens. The main outcome was all-cause 60-day mortality. The characteristics and outcomes of severe HMPV-associated CAP patients were compared with those of severe IFV-associated CAP patients. Subgroup analyses were performed according to the presence or absence of immunocompromised condition [9] . Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, and continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. p values of < 0.05 were considered significant. All analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows version 23.0 (IBM SPSS, Armonk, New York).\n\nIn total, 1559 patients with severe CAP were admitted to the medical ICU. One or more pathogens were identified in 65.9% (1,027/1559) of patients. Overall, rhinovirus was the most commonly identified virus (7.7%, n = 120), followed by influenza virus (7.0%, n = 109), parainfluenza virus (4.6%, n = 71), human coronavirus (3.6%, n = 56), respiratory syncytial virus (3.3%, n = 52), and HMPV (3.2%), n = 50). Table 1 lists the characteristics of the enrolled patients. The median ages of the HMPV group and the IFV group were 70.0 years and 68.0 years, respectively. Diabetes mellitus, structural lung disease, malignancy, and end-stage renal disease were the most common underlying diseases in both groups. Of these, diabetes mellitus was significantly more common in the HMPV group (38.0% vs. 21.1%, p = 0.03). Eleven patients (22.0%) in the HMPV group and 35 (32.1%) in the IFV group were categorized as immunocompromised, respectively (p = 0.19). Fever (> 38\u00b0C) tended to be more common in the IFV group (p = 0.07). Otherwise, the initial manifestations were similar between the groups. Co-pathogens were less commonly found in the HMPV group (30.0% vs. 48.6%, p = 0.03). The detailed composition of co-infections is summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The most common dominant radiology pattern was bronchopneumonia in both groups (66.0% vs. 57.8%, p = 0.33). Supplementary Figure 1 shows the monthly distribution of HMPV and IFV cases during the study period. Severe HMPV and IFV-associated CAP occurred predominantly from January to June and December to April, respectively. This finding was consistent with the observed pattern of HMPV and IFV incidence in the community. Of 50 HMPV patients, 20 (40.0%) were administered oral ribavirin therapy for more than 48 h, and 5 were administered intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. Six patients were administered IVIG therapy alone.\n\nOutcomes of enrolled patients are summarized in Table 2 . Supplementary Table 2 In a subgroup of non-immunocompromised patients, the 60-day mortality rates of HMPV and IFV group were 25.6% and 31.1%, respectively (p = 0.55). In immunocompromised patients, the 60-day mortality rates of the hMPV and IFV groups were 54.5% and 54.3%, respectively (p = 0.99). The median lengths of ICU stay (HMPV 9.5 days vs. IFV 10.0 days, p = 0.28) and hospital stay (HMPV 16.5 days vs. IFV 23.0 days, p = 0.11) were not significantly different between the two groups.\n\nWe determined that HMPV and IFV accounted for 3.2% and 7.0% of ICU admissions for severe CAP, respectively. The mortality rate of severe HMPV-associated CAP was similar to that of severe IFV-associated CAP. Our findings show that HMPV infections are associated with a considerable incidence and mortality in patients with severe CAP.\n\nThe mortality data in our cohort should be interpreted with caution. Almost all patients with severe IFV-associated CAP received antiviral therapy, either oseltamivir or peramivir, whereas only 40.0% (20/50) of HMPV patients received antiviral therapy. The presence of end-stage renal disease (n = 8) or chronic renal failure (n = 5) may prohibit the use of ribavirin [10] . Furthermore, there has been no proven effective therapy for HMPV pneumonia. Oral ribavirin alone or in combination with IVIG was not beneficial for HMPV patients in our study. The similar mortality rates between the two groups, despite a lack of effective antiviral therapy in HMPV patients, indicate that the virulence potential of HMPV might be lower than that of IFV. Larger controlled studies are needed to clarify the effectiveness of antiviral therapy and virulence potentials of HMPV infection.\n\nLimited information is available on the outcomes of severe HMPVassociated CAP patients. Recently, Hwang et al. retrospectively analyzed the risks of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mortality following HMPV infection in hospitalized adults [6] . The inhospital mortality rate among 22 ARDS patients was 36.4%, which is similar to that noted in our study. They included some immunocompromised patients and cases of hospital-acquired infection. Because the mortality rates of those patients were not analyzed separately, it was difficult to directly compare these mortality rates with our results. Another study included 40 HMPV-positive patients admitted to the ICU [5] . The overall mortality was 18.0%. The proportion of patients who required mechanical ventilation (55.0%) was lower than that in our study (90.0%). None of these prior studies included control groups for comparison. Because the characteristics and outcomes of IFV-associated pneumonia have been well-documented, we compared the outcomes between severe HMPV-associated CAP and IFV-associated CAP patients. We combined the IFV-A and IFV-B subgroups and used it as control group in our analysis. The outcomes of the IFV-A and IFV-B subgroups may be different. We provided outcome data for each group in Table 2 . When we compared the outcomes between the IFV-A and IFV-B groups, the differences were not significant (data not shown). However, considering the small number of IFV-B cases, this issue should be investigated in further studies.\n\nOur study has several limitations. First, it was performed at a single center, which limits generalization. Second, we did not have an adequate number of fatal outcomes for multivariable analyses in HMPV patients. Third, we included co-infection cases in both groups, and these cases were more common in the influenza group. Co-infections may have affected the outcomes and bias comparisons between the groups [11] . Fourth, our cases may have included cases of incidental upper respiratory tract infection or colonization [12] . Finally, HMPV genotypic information and viral load, which may affect the disease outcome, were not available in our study.\n\nIn conclusion, the incidence of HMPV infection was approximately half that of IFV infection in patients with severe CAP. The mortality rate of severe HMPV-associated CAP was substantial and comparable to that of severe IFV-associated CAP. "}
