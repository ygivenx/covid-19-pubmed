{"title": "", "body": "of a plethora of varied nano-drug delivery systems, not only by the academic institutions but also by industrial organizations. This led to the availability of a huge database comprising several research papers and patents from all over world, describing these new dosage forms. Numerous funding agencies and industries actively promoted research into nanoparticulate drug delivery vehicles and huge investments were made to this end. All these diverse and concurrent efforts created an awareness about the immense potential of these new drug delivery systems, which were then looked upon as therapeutic regimens of the future.\n\nThere are many reasons behind the development and success of nanoparticulate drug delivery systems. A few years ago, the entire attention of pharmaceutical industry was focused on the novel developments in designing various dosage forms, primarily due to expiry of the existing patents, a surfeit of poorly soluble drug candidates and the problems of non-specifi city from conventional dosage forms. Under these circumstances, the development of nanoparticulate drug delivery systems gained huge momentum due to a number of diverse factors listed in the following section of this chapter. \u25a0 The pharmaceutical industries were poised to provide quality products to the patient, at the same time increasing or maintaining their profi tability. However, this process demanded extensive scientifi c innovation and fi nancial support. Development of new chemical entities and their transition from the laboratory to market required the company to expend as high as 800 million US dollars [1] . Apart from a huge investment, the development of the new drug was also an extensively time consuming process with very limited success rates.\n\n\u25a0 Research progress in the drug discovery area resulted in the development of various poorly soluble drug candidates. The solubility limitations of these drug candidates, in turn, lead to poor bioavailability and lower therapeutic effi cacy [2, 3] . In such situations, formulation of these therapeutic molecules into nanoparticulate delivery systems was observed to improve their bioavailability and hence elicit the desired therapeutic effects from these candidates. The nanoparticles also received a prominence due to other probable benefi ts like biodegradability, biocompatibility, high encapsulation characteristics and probability of surface functionalization [1] [2] [3] .\n\n\u25a0 Nanoparticles were found to exhibit several advantages for parenteral drug delivery; counter to the aggregation phenomenon commonly observed with microparticles, the smaller size of nanoparticles endowed them with better distribution profi les during systemic \u25a0 Owing to their small size, nanoparticles were found to effectively traverse many biological barriers. Of signifi cant importance is their ability to permeate the blood brain barrier (BBB). Although brain administration is an effective route for the treatment of various brain diseases, it is severely limited due to the highly impermeable nature of the BBB. Because of their potential to cross this barrier, numerous publications have demonstrated the effectiveness of nanoparticles for targeting various central nervous system disorders [6] . Nanospectra Bioscience, Texas, USA, has recently initiated a clinical trial of nanoparticle based 'nanoshells' for the treatment of brain tumors [7] .\n\n\u25a0 The size of nanoparticles offers distinct advantages when compared with conventional dosage forms. The tunable size of these systems greatly infl uences the release profi le of the encapsulated active component, so a formulator could thus control the drug release at the site of action [8, 9] . \u25a0 Nanoparticles were found to be highly versatile systems to encapsulate and delivery not only chemical drug moieties but also nuclic acid therapeutics (DNA, siRNA), and imaging and diagnostic agents, for site-specifi c delivery and detection. Various ligands can be attached to the surface of nanoparticles to guide them to specifi c locations within the body [9, 10] .\n\nThus nanoparticulate drug carriers found applications in several diverse quarters of drug delivery research and, due to their tunable properties, they were foreseen as the future of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry.\n\nDrug transport through a biological barrier largely depends upon its solubility. Solubility exhibits an important infl uence on drug permeation and absorption. The solubility of drugs has been a concern for formulation scientists because of the diffi culties in developing oral and parenteral delivery systems for poorly soluble drugs. Though the pharmaceutical sector is witnessing vast advances in drug discovery and its therapeutic horizon is expanding, it is the existing drug molecules and novel drug candidates that pose major solubility problems. Various reports indicate that approximately 40% of the drugs which are currently in the market have poor water solubility [11] . About one-third of the drug candidates in the pharmacopoeia exhibit the same solubility limitations. Low water solubility in turn hampers adequate absorption and hence leads to low therapeutic effi cacy [12] . The solubility constraint of drugs and novel drug candidates is thus one of the major obstacles to the development of therapeutically effective drug delivery systems. Nanoparticles made from natural/synthetic polymers, lipids, proteins and phospholipids have received greater attention due to higher stability and the opportunity for further surface modifi cations [13] . They can be tailored to achieve both controlled drug release and disease-specifi c localization, either by tuning the material characteristics or by altering the surface chemistry [14] . It has been established that nanocarriers can become concentrated preferentially in the tumor mass, sites of infl ammation, and at sites of infection by virtue of the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of the vasculature. Once accumulated at the target site, hydrophobic biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles can act as a local drug depot, depending upon the make-up of the carrier, thus providing a reservoir for continuous supply of encapsulated therapeutic compound at the disease site, such as, a solid tumor. These systems, in general, can be used to provide targeted (cellular/tissue) delivery of drugs, to improve oral bioavailability, to sustain drug/gene effects in the target tissue, to solubilize drugs for intravascular delivery, or to improve the stability of therapeutic agents against enzymatic degradation (nucleases and proteases), this being especially relevant for protein, peptide, and nucleotide based agents [13, 15, 16] . Thus, the advantages of using nanoparticles for drug delivery result from two main basic properties: their small size and the use of biodegradable materials.\n\nMany studies have demonstrated that nanoparticles of sub-micron size have a number of advantages over conventional dosage forms as drug delivery carriers [17] . A further advantage over conventional drug delivery systems is their better suitability for intravenous (i.v.) delivery. The smallest capillaries in the body are 5-6 \u03bc m in diameter. Therefore the size of particles being distributed into the bloodstream must be signifi cantly smaller than 5 \u03bc m, without forming aggregates, to ensure that the particles do not lead to an embolism. Additionally, some types of cells permit the uptake of only sub-micron particles and not their larger counterparts. Generally nanoparticles have relatively higher intracellular uptake compared to microparticles and are available to a much wider range of biological targets due to their small size and relative mobility. Desai et al. found that 100 nm nanoparticles had a 2.5 fold greater uptake than 1 \u03bc m microparticles, and 6 fold greater uptake than 10 \u03bc m microparticles in a CaCo -2 cell line [16] . Secondly, the use of biodegradable materials for nanoparticle preparation allows sustained drug release within the target site over a period of days or even weeks.\n\nWith regards to the material of formulation, biodegradable nanoparticles formulated from polymers and lipids have been developed for intracellular sustained drug delivery, especially for drugs with an intracellular target [13, 16] . Rapid escape of these nanoparticles from the endo-lysosomal compartment to the cytoplasmic compartment has been demonstrated [13, 17] . Additionally, they were demonstrated to effectively sustain the intracellular drug levels, thus allowing a more effi cient interaction with the cytoplasmic receptors. Thus, nanoparticles could serve as effective delivery vehicles for drugs with cytoplasmic targets.\n\nTo summarize, nanoparticles have proven advantages over the conventional dosage forms. They offer a reliable alternative to the pharmaceutical industry to improve the therapeutic effects of existing drugs, elicit better effect from new chemical entities and to deliver sensitive molecules like proteins, peptides, DNA and RNA.\n\nNanoemulsions are optically isotropic and thermodynamically stable systems of two immiscible liquids -typically water, oil and surfactant(s) -in which one liquid is dispersed as droplets in another liquid. Emulsions with nanoscopic droplet sizes (typically in the range of 20-200 nm) are often referred to as nanoemulsions [18] . Nanoemulsions offer enhanced solubilization capacity for poorly soluble drugs, increased drug loading, and in turn lead to a higher bioavailability of the formulated therapeutic moiety. Various GRAS (generally regarded as safe) approved, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and nonionic surfactants are commonly used for formulating the nanoemulsions. The formulation of nanoemulsions can either involve appropriate energy inputs (ultrasonication, high pressure homogenization, microfl uidization) or may be a spontaneous process. There are a few commercial products like Estrasorb \u00ae and Flexogan \u00ae which are based on nanoemulsion technology [19, 20] . Estrasorb \u00ae is estradiol topical emulsion developed by Novavax and is recommended for the reduction of vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women. Estrasorb \u00ae is composed of soyabean oil, water, polysorbate 80 and water and is based on micellar nanoparticle technology. This technology proves that poorly water soluble molecules like estradiol can be successfully formulated and commercialized using nanoparticulate delivery vehicles [20, 21].\n\nYet another example of a nanoemulsion based product is that of Flexogan \u00ae developed by AlphaRx, Canada, which is a pain relief cream based on colloidal dispersion of nanoparticles. The oil droplets contain natural pain medicaments like menthol and camphor and as nanoparticles permeating faster through the skin, thereby providing a rapid relief. Once again in this case the nanoparticulate delivery is responsible for a higher bioavailability and quicker onset of action of the encapsulated actives [22].\n\nBioavailability of poorly water soluble drugs is frequently related to the particle size of the drug molecule. Particle size reduction of these drug molecules improves the overall surface area, dissolution properties and thus leads to a higher bioavailability of the drug. Formulating drug nanocrystals is one of the most successful strategies to improve the drug solubility and bioavailability. Numerous methods may be employed to generate the drug nanocrystals which include high pressure homogenization, media milling and nanoprecipitation [12, 23] .\n\nHigh-pressure homogenization involves passage of the coarse drug suspension along with a suitable stabilizer through the tiny homogenizer gap at a very high pressure (up to 2000 bar) [23] . This process can be performed in presence of water or non-aqueous media. The non-aqueous medium is specifi cally useful when there are chances of drug degradation because of aqueous media. The pressure is responsible for the generation of nanoparticles due to various principles, such as cavitation, disintegration and shearing, and based upon these, three important technologies have been designed for nanocrystal production using highpressure homogenization. The technologies are Piston gap homogenization in water (Dissocubes \u00ae technology), Microfl uidizer technology (IDD-P\u2122 technology) and Nanopure \u00ae technology [12, 23] .\n\nTriglide \u00ae is the fi rst clinically approved nanocrystal product developed using high-pressure homogenization and is indicated for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Triglide \u00ae has been produced using the IDD-P\u2122 technology by Skyepharma and has been marketed by Sciele Pharma Inc.\n\n[23, 24]. The drug candidate in this product is fenofi brate, a lipophilic compound which is practically insoluble in water. The bioavailability of fenofi brate is severely limited due to its poor water solubility although clinical observations have revealed a higher bioavailability in fed-state patients. This has been attributed to the lipids and associated compounds in the meal which enhance its solubility and hence absorption [25] . In another study, micronization of fenofi brate was found to enhance its dissolution and hence its oral bioavailability. This study also confi rmed the reason for nanocrystals of fenofi brate, with a still lower particle size, to further improve its bioavailability, when compared with the micronized form [26] .\n\nOf all the homogenization methods, media milling has been the most successful in producing drug nanocrystals, primarily due to its simplicity and scalability. Additionally, media milling is also economical compared to the other methodologies. Here, the nanoparticle generation depends upon the shearing forces and impact between the moving beds of milling material and the mixture of drug and stabilizer. Despite a few limitations of this method like drug loss and adhesion, it is still preferred by the pharmaceutical industry for generating drug nanoparticles [11, 27] .\n\nRapamune \u00ae is one of the fi rst nanocrystal products developed using media milling technology by Elan Drug Technologies. Rapamune \u00ae consists of sirolimus, a poorly water soluble compound, indicated for prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving renal transplants. Elan termed this technology as NanoCrystal \u00ae technology and it involves the particle size reduction of drug to formulate drug nanoparticles [11, 23] . The particle size reduction leads to a higher dissolution, higher absorption and hence enhanced bioavailability. Rapamune \u00ae was found to overcome the problems associated with rapamycin, the conventional dosage form of sirolimus. It demonstrated 27% more bioavailability, improved patient compliance and better shelf-life when compared with conventional product. Additionally, the product also met with tremendous economic success [28] [29] [30] .\n\nEmend \u00ae is another successful product of Merck and developed by Elan Drug Technologies. Aprepitant, the active ingredient of Emend \u00ae , has poor aqueous solubility (3-7 \u03bc g/ml) with moderate permeability (CaCo -2 permeability reported at 7.85 \u00d7 10 \u22126 cm/s). With the conventional formulation of aprepitant, it was observed that food plays a signifi cant role on the rate and amount of drug absorbed. Emend \u00ae , on the other hand, eliminated this requirement and the drug absorption and bioavailability was enhanced by 600%, as compared to the conventional product. This product was also recently approved in Japan, and is now available in US, Europe and Japan 31, 32] .\n\nVarious other products like Tricor \u00ae (Fenofi brate), Megace ES \u00ae (Megestrol), Invega \u00ae , Sustenna \u00ae /Xeplion \u00ae (Paliperidone palmitate) are also produced as nanoparticles, by media milling, to overcome the solubility issues. The details of all such products have been listed in Table 1 .1 .\n\nThe above two methods describe the 'top-down' approach of particle size reduction, aimed to enhance the solubility and bioavailability of drug candidates. These methods are relatively simple and economical; however, the processes possess complexity for formulating sensitive molecules with respect to size and surface control.\n\nIn such cases, the 'bottom-up' approach provides an alternative challenging method for generating drug nanoparticles. The approach is specifi cally useful when there is a need to load a nanoparticle with many active ingredients or the surface of nanoparticle needs to be functionally altered [11, 33, 34] .\n\nBased on this approach, the nanoprecipitation method involves the generation of drug nanoparticles by nucleation and growth of the drug crystals. The nucleation process is triggered by dissolving excess of drug in a suitable solvent, resulting in a super-saturated solution. The supersaturated mixture is then normally added to an antisolventstabilized mixture to produce nanocrystals. Various parameters in this process control the ultimate size and surface characteristics. Nanocrystals produced by nanoprecipitation method are presently in preclinical stage and to date these systems have not yet met with clinical or industrial success [11, [33] [34] [35] .\n\nThough the pharmaceutical industry is witnessing enormous developments in the fi eld of nanoparticulate drug delivery systems, it is still faced with numerous scientifi c queries and challenges. Limited solubility and poor bioavailability allowed the pharmaceutical industry to look beyond conventional drug delivery systems and that was the primary reason for the nano-drug delivery systems to occupy a signifi cant position in formulation research and development. The development of these technologies is limited to few pharmaceutical industries and continents. Wide-ranging acceptance of the nanoparticle based drug delivery systems is still far from realization. The developed nanoparticulate drug delivery systems need to be investigated for their own unique pharmacological actions and safety profi les. The drug release profi les, in vitro-in vivo (IVIVC) correlations, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodyanamic profi les need to be thoroughly established before they can be routinely adopted for clinical applications.\n\nOne of the major drawbacks associated with conventional drug delivery systems is their non-specifi c nature. The conventional dosage forms are generally formulated using an excess of drug as compared to its actual dose because these formulations deliver only a small fraction of this drug to the affected area, while a major part is distributed throughout the body. This random distribution leads to unwanted side effects and toxicities [36] . Nanoparticles are able to provide site specifi city and can be targeted to a specifi c tissue or organ of the body to give the desired therapeutic effect with minimal side effects. The targeting capacity of nanoparticles is one of the most important reasons behind their success. Targeted drug delivery has been proven highly benefi cial for the treatment of cancer, since the majority of the anticancer drugs are normally known to harm non-cancerous body cells. [37] . Drug targeting through nanoparticles is usually achieved by their surface functionalization with various ligands, which can identify and bind to certain cellular receptors of the body [38] .\n\nTargeted drug delivery is a broad terminology and has been investigated for decades, specifi cally for cancer. This research has also been extended to other organs susceptible for site-specifi c diseases and the following sections of this chapter have been dedicated to these numerous facets of targeted drug delivery. Targeted drug delivery is normally achieved either via active targeting or passive targeting [39] .\n\nActive targeting involves direct routing of the drug and/or the delivery system to the diseased biological site to minimize the side effects. RNA interference (RNAi) therapy and monoclonal antibodies are well known examples of this approach. The RNAi approach is a rapidly expanding fi eld and has particularly gained a momentum due to huge investments by the pharmaceutical industry in developing RNAi based therapeutics. This therapy has potential for the treatment of various fatal diseases like cancer, viral infections and various genetic diseases. The details of RNAi therapy are described in Chapter 2 of this book. On other hand, monoclonal antibody-based therapy has been investigated for various diseases, such as cardiovascular disorders, infl ammatory disorders and cancer. The antibodies bind only to the specifi c cells which they are intended to target and stimulate an immunological response against these targeted cells [40, 41] .\n\nPassive targeting may be achieved employing drug delivery systems administered via different delivery routes, where the delivery system enhances the effect of the drug utilizing the functions of the targeted site. For example, drug delivery is enhanced through the more permeable cancer tissues as compared to their normal counterparts, due to leaky vasculature and enhanced permeation retention (EPR) effect of the former. Similarly, delivery through nasal, transdermal and intra-uterine routes are also utilized in passive targeting [40, 42] .\n\nTargeted delivery for cancer is one of the most-investigated areas, with the majority of commercial products belonging to this category. Conventional cancer therapy, i.e. chemotherapy and radiotherapy, are effective in the early stages of cancer detection; however, adverse effects arising from these therapies pose a major challenge [43] . Nanoparticlebased targeted drug delivery provides a huge potential for cancer therapy, primarily due to the favorable dimensions and surface functionalities of these carrier systems. These systems can enter tumor cells and interact with cellular receptors, and are thus able to inhibit the growth and spread of the cancer. Targeted nanocarriers for cancer facilitate precise cellular and molecular alterations and are hence more effective and less harmful to the normal cells than conventional treatments, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy [44] . Table 1 .2 cites some of the nanoparticulate systems, along with their respective oncological indications, which have been developed by various industries.\n\nThe majority of nanoparticulate systems for targeted drug delivery to cancers are surface functionalized with appropriate ligands. These ligands facilitate cellular binding, internalization and specifi c therapeutic effects. Optimization of the process of attachment of the ligand to the nanoparticulate surface is one of the chief factors that govern the precise targeting of nanoparticles. Another important factor includes exclusivity of the targeted ligand to the cancer cells with negligible occurrence on the other healthy cells of the body [43] [44] [45] . Some of the common targeting strategies have been listed in Table 1 .3 .\n\nThe past decade has witnessed a sharp rise in the number of targeted drug nanoparticles that have been approved for cancer therapy. Liposomal nanoparticles were the fi rst in this category and were successful in alleviating the adverse effects associated with drugs in conventional dosage forms [43] . An excellent example of this is liposomal doxorubicin, which resulted in a signifi cant reduction in the severe cardiotoxicity of the native drug. Doxil \u00ae (pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) was the fi rst nanoparticulate product approved for targeted cancer therapy. Pegylated liposomes demonstrated improved pharmacokinetic and pharacodynamic profi les. Polyethyeleneglycol (PEG) coating thus constituted one of the fi rst, commercial targeting strategies [43, 63] . It also afforded additional stability to the nanoparticles and prevented their elimination by reticuloendothilial system (RES). Tagging of PEG on nanoparticle surface, also known as 'steric stabilization' or 'stealth effect', was also reported to improve their blood circulation time and uptake by macrophages [43, 64] . Abraxane \u00ae is another commercially successful product for the targeted cancer therapy. Abraxane \u00ae (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension) is an albumin-bound form of paclitaxel with a mean particle size of approximately 130 nm. Paclitaxel, indicated for Targeted cancer therapy using nanoparticles breast cancer therapy, is a poorly soluble molecule. There are many formulation challenges associated with paclitaxel like inherent solubility problems and toxicity issues. Moreover, the existing formulation (Taxol \u00ae ) of this drug exhibits severe adverse effect attributable to its excipient, Cremophor EL. When compared with Taxol \u00ae , Abraxane \u00ae provided an improved tumor cell penetration of paclitaxel and decreased the occurrence of Cremophor related adverse effects [43, 65, 66] . These benefi ts of Abraxane \u00ae are due to the natural property of its key ingredient, albumin, to transport the lipophilic molecules through noncovalent binding. Albumin, a predominant plasma protein, binds to the glycoprotein receptor gp60 and maintains the transendothelial oncotic pressure gradient by regulating the transport of bound/unbound plasma components such as fatty acids, steroids, thyroxine, and amino acids. The receptor subsequently binds to caveolin-1 with successive formation of caveolae, a key determinant of transcellular endothelial permeability. Albumin is accumulated in breast, lung, head, neck and prostate cancer by binding with the secreted protein acid rich in cystein (SPARC). SPARCalbumin interaction supports the accumulation of albumin in tumor and increases the effectiveness of albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel). The success of nab nanoparticles has paved a way for their use in different types of cancer, and a large number of clinical trials, utilizing these nanoparticles, are presently in progress [43, [67] [68] [69] [70] ].\n\nThe drug development for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders has been increasing; however, the preclinical and clinical successes are still far from reality. The global market for drugs for central nervous system (CNS) diseases is limited due to various reasons like high cost of drug development, a very high risk to benefi t ratio, a limited understanding of these diseases and the formulation intricacies for brain delivery [71] . Other diffi culties in effi ciently treating CNS disorders include the limited number of available drugs and lack of a broad understanding of the etiology of brain diseases. Examples of the diseases in this category (see Figure 1 .1 ) include Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, HIV infection of the brain and brain tumors [71, 72] .\n\nHowever, in the past few years, there has been a tremendous improvement in drug discovery for CNS diseases. According to a report from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), approximately 313 diverse drugs for various CNS disorders An overview of market progress in CNS drug development (Data is based on the press information released by respective pharmaceutical companies till July 2012) (majorly addiction and depression) are currently in research and production pipeline. Additionally, the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development states that approximately 1747 drugs are in development for various other CNS disorders like multiple sclerosis and epilepsy [73] .\n\nHowever, the physicochemical characteristics of most of these molecules are unfavorable for their effi cient transport through the blood brain barrier (BBB), one of the most diffi cult biological barriers, which hinder provision of an effective strategy for treating CNS diseases. The BBB consists of different cellular components, such as endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocytes, and microglial cells, interconnected with each other by tight, impermeable junctions. In presence of these natural barriers, drug delivery to the CNS may be performed using invasive methods or non-invasive methods or their combinations. Invasive methods can generate various complications, and are thus adopted only in cases of fatal diseases. In the non-invasive category, nanoparticulate drug carriers have demonstrated great potential for successful therapies [74] . The surface modifi cation of these systems allows them to be directed to specifi c receptors in the brain while their small size can be exploited for traversing the BBB. Additionally, nanoparticles also prevent structural modifi cation of the drug and can deliver the drug to the desired site in its original form. Other properties of nanoparticles, like biodegradability, low particle size (\u2248 100 nm), prolonged circulation by surface modifi cation, receptor medicated transcytosis, large-scale production ability, possibility for loading of drugs/peptides and the ability to control the release of encapsulated active agent, make them ideal for targeted drug delivery to the brain [72] [73] [74] [75] . Table 1 .4 indicates various targeting strategies for brain targeting using nanoparticles.\n\nThere is an immense market opportunity for colon targeted drug products and it has been estimated that the US market for products of colorectal cancer will reach $6050 million by 2016, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.6% [98] . Colon targeted drug delivery has steadily grown for the treatment of various colon specifi c diseases as well as for the systemic delivery of macromolecules such as peptides.\n\nTargeting the colon has become very important for treating diseases like infl ammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, colon cancer and ulcerative colitis. Our research group has specifi cally investigated the effi cacy of polymeric nanoparticles for colon cancer as well as for ulcerative colitis [99] .\n\nExamples of brain-targeted nanoparticles at preclinical stage (modifi ed from [76] ) Nanoparticles for colon targeting can be formulated using natural or synthetic polymers. There is a wide range of polymers which have been established or are being investigated for their colon targeting potential. The colon targeted nanoparticles have demonstrated their ability to enhance the solubility, absorption and bioavailability of the encapsulated drugs [99, 100] . Additionally, colon targeted nanoparticles have also shown a huge potential for delivering peptides. Etiologies of various colon diseases have shown that macrophages are activated in course of the disease cascade because of immune response by the infl amed cellular structures in the colon. These activated macrophages can effi ciently take up the nanoparticles and this governs the accumulation of a large number of nanoparticles in the colon region. This accumulation, in turn, elicits a pronounced therapeutic effect from the colon targeted nano-systems [99, 100] .\n\nLiterature reports describe the employment of nanoparticles for the colon targeted delivery of various encapsulated moieties. Zheng et al. [101] have reported the incorporation of Thymopentin, a potent immunomodulating drug, into pH-sensitive chitosan nanoparticles coated with Eudragit S100 (ES100) to improve the stability and the oral bioavailability of the encapsulated agent. Uniform nanoparticles with a size of about 175 nm and a moderately high encapsulation of around 76% were formulated. The nanoparticles were found to effectively protect the encapsulated moiety from enzymatic degradation and prolong its degradation half-time. Results of lymphocyte proliferation test and in vivo evaluation in rats demonstrated that the nanoparticles could be used as effective vectors for the oral delivery of Thymopentin. Wang et al. [102] have reported the development of Cyclosporine A (CyA) loaded pH-sensitive nanoparticles of ES 100. Various in vivo studies conducted by this research group revealed that the nanoparticles increased the absorption of CyA, which could be attributed to a fast stomach empting rate, site specifi c absorption and lower degradation rate of the entrapped moiety by the luminal contents and the high bioadhesion of nanoparticles to the intestine mucosa. The authors have claimed that the investigation could be helpful for the design of dosage forms for other peptide or protein drugs. Researchers have reported the effi ciency of ES 100 nanoparticles as a favorable vehicle for the selective absorption of drugs in the gut, when administered by the oral route. This was proved by encapsulating Rhodamine 6G (Rho) as a model agent. The nanoparticles were evaluated for Rho release profi les, distribution, adhesion and transition in rat gut. It was observed that the nanoparticles decreased the distribution and adhesion of Rho in the stomach but increased these values in the intestine. Additionally, these nanocarriers were reported to control the drug release sites and release rate in the GI tract [103] . Scientists have also investigated the potential of ES 100 to improve oral delivery of HIV-1 protease inhibitors in dogs [104] . Incorporation of a HIV-1 protease inhibitor, HIV CGP 57813, into ES 100 nanoparticles was found to substantially increase the oral bioavailability of this compound after administration to dogs and achieve plasma levels comparable to those obtained in studies conducted in lower animals such as mice [105] .\n\nThe lungs present a promising route for drug delivery due to its noninvasive nature and possibility of systemic and local drug delivery. Pulmonary market is expected to increase by up to $24.5 billion by 2015, with a CAGR of 2.8% [106]. There is a growing need for novel therapeutic systems for the treatment of respiratory disease like tuberculosis, pulmonary hypertension, cystic fi brosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Pulmonary route is also being increasingly exploited for the delivery of peptides and vaccines. In view of this enormous need, nanoparticles can provide the right therapeutic option for the treatment of variety of respiratory diseases [107] . Nanoparticle systems in targeted pulmonary drug delivery offers various advantages such as uniform distribution of drug in alveoli, bypassing of fi rst pass metabolism, high solubility, sustained release property, reduced side effects, delivery of macromolecules and improved patient compliance. Lung targeting using nanoparticles can also be achieved through parenteral route. However, researchers have preferred the pulmonary route over the latter [108, 109] . A summary of various nanoparticulate carriers, intended for targeting the lung, has been presented in Table 1 .5 .\n\nIt is thus evident that nanoparticulate drug carriers cater to distinct needs and play defi nite roles in overcoming the 'lags' encountered with the conventional drug delivery systems. Numerous types of fascinating nanoparticulate drug carriers have stemmed from the research conducted during the last three decades. Also notable is the number of conditions where they may be applied, via different administration routes, for better therapeutic outcomes. With persistence from both academia and industry, some of these systems have successfully accomplished the cumbersome transition from laboratories to clinics. In this book, we intend to provide an overview of these different therapeutic nanoparticles, the challenges Examples of nanoparticulate carriers targeted to the lung (modifi ed from [107] [108] [109] Amphotericin B Phospholipid and apolipoprotein Lung infection [114] Amiloride hydrochloride Liposome Cystic fi brosis [108] Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor Liposome Cystic fi brosis [115] Interleukin-4 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides Polymeric nanoparticle Asthma [116] Vasoactive intestinal peptide Protamine nanoparticle Asthma [117] Indomethacin, ketoprofen Solid Lipid nanoparticles Asthma [108] Antisense oligonucleotide 2'-O-methyl-RNA PLGA nanoparticles Lung cancer [118] Leuprolide Liposome Lung cancer [108] HLA-A*0201-restricted T-cell epitopes from Mycobacterium tuberculosis Chitosan nanoparticles Tuberculosis [119] V1Jns plasmid encoding antigen 85B from M. tuberculosis PLGA-PEI nanoparticle Tuberculosis [120] Insulin PLGA, PLGA-PEI, PEI, Chitosan, Alginate Diabetes [121] encountered in their transition to clinical settings, the solutions which may be adopted for surmounting these challenges and the success stories of some of these drug delivery nanoparticles."}
