{"title": "Articles Radiological findings from 81 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study", "body": "Beginning in December, 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia with unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China. 1 On Jan 7, 2020, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARSCoV2; previously known as 2019nCoV), was identified as the causative organism by Chinese facilities via deep sequencing analysis of patients' res piratory tract samples. 2, 3 SARSCoV2 has been shown to infect human respiratory epithelial cells through an interaction between the viral S protein and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor on human cells; thus, SARSCoV2 possesses a strong capability to infect humans. 3 Most of the initial cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), the disease caused by SARSCoV2, were epidemiologically linked to exposure to Wuhan's Huanan seafood market, where wild animals are traded. 4, 5 Although the market has been closed since Jan 1, 2020, as part of efforts to contain the outbreak, patients without exposure to the market but with a history of travel to Wuhan or close physical contact with a patient confirmed to have COVID19, including healthcare workers, have also been identified, suggesting strong humantohuman transmission. The number of cases has been increasing rapidly: by Feb 15, 2020, more than 60 000 cases of COVID19 pneumonia had been reported in China and in other countries worldwide (including Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and the USA), [6] [7] [8] [9] and 1524 patients had died, equivalent to a mortality rate of around 2%.\n\nThe clinical features of the initial 41 patients confirmed to be infected with SARSCoV2 included lower respiratory tract illness with fever, dry cough, and dyspnoea, 5 a manifestation similar to those of two other diseases caused by coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). 10, 11 However, the radiological changes in the lungs of people with COVID19 pneumonia have not been fully characterised. CT is important in the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases. In our experience, the imaging features of COVID19 pneumonia are diverse, ranging from normal appearance to diffuse changes in the lungs. In addition, different radiological patterns are observed at different times throughout the disease course. Because the time between onset of symptoms and the development of acute respiratory distress syn drome (ARDS) was as short as 9 days among the initial patients with COVID19 pneumonia, 5 early recognition of the disease is essential for the management of these patients.\n\nWe aimed to analyse the evolution of chest CT imaging features in patients with COVID19 pneumonia, and to compare the imaging findings across the disease course, to facilitate early diagnosis of this newly emerging, life threatening infection.\n\nThis was a retrospective study done at two centres in Wuhan. Patients with confirmed COVID19 pneumonia who were admitted to Wuhan Jinyintan hospital or Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, and who underwent serial chest CT scans, were retrospectively enrolled.\n\nIn the patients who presented to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, SARSCoV2 infection was confirmed by nextgeneration sequencing or realtime RTPCR, in according with a previously published protocol. 5 The following primers and probe targeted to the envelope gene of SARSCoV2 were used: forward primer 5\u02b9TCAGAATGCCAATCTCCCCAAC3\u02b9; reverse primer 5\u02b9AAAGGTCCACCCGATACATTGA3\u02b9; probe 5\u02b9CY5 CTAGTTACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGC3\u02b9BHQ1.\n\nThe diagnosis of the cases from Union Hospital was initially based on the criteria published by WHO on Jan 12, 2020, 12 and all cases were later confirmed by real time RTPCR analysis of throat swab specimens, using the same protocol as above when PCR kits were available.\n\nBased on the time interval between onset of symptoms and the CT scan, we designated four groups of patients in our study: group 1 (subclinical cases, in which CT scans were done before onset of symptoms); group 2 (CT scans done \u22641 week after symptom onset); group 3 (CT scans done >1 to 2 weeks after symptom onset); and group 4 (CT scans done >2 weeks to 3 weeks after symptom onset). Three readers (XH, NJ, and YF) recorded the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and comorbidities of the patients at the time of imaging.\n\nThis study was approved by the institutional review boards of the relevant centres. The requirement for informed patient consent was waived by the ethics committee for this retrospective study.\n\nAll CT scans were obtained with patients in the supine position, using one of the following scanners: SOMATOM Perspective, SOMATOM Spirit, or SOMATOM Definition AS+ (Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany). Scans were done from the level of the upper thoracic inlet to the inferior level of the costophrenic angle, and the following parameters were used: detector collimation widths 64 \u00d7 0\u00b76 mm, 128 \u00d7 0\u00b76 mm, 64 \u00d7 0\u00b76 mm, and 64 \u00d7 0\u00b76 mm; and tube voltage 120 kV. The tube current was regulated by an automatic exposure control system (CARE Dose 4D; Siemens Healthineers). Images were reconstructed with a slice thickness of 1\u00b75 mm or 1 mm and an interval of 1\u00b75 mm or 1 mm, respectively. The\n\nEvidence before this study Before this study, we searched PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar on Jan, 24, 2020, for articles describing the radiological features of patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously known as 2019 novel coronavirus [2019-nCoV]), using the search terms \"novel coronavirus\" or \"2019-nCoV\" and \"radiology \"or \"imaging\" or \"CT\", with no time restrictions. We also searched CNKI and Wanfang Data using the same terms in Chinese, with no time restrictions. We found only previously published research discussing the radiological characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and preliminary studies on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. We found no published work about the radiological characteristics of patients with pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nWe analysed chest CT images from 81 patients confirmed to have COVID-19 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and described the imaging findings across different follow-up periods of the disease, including subclinical and clinical stages up to 3 weeks after symptom onset. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest case series to date on the CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia worldwide, and provides detailed information on the radiological, clinical, and laboratory features of these patients. Our findings provide insight in the evolution of the disease and its corresponding imaging changes, and suggest potential associations between imaging findings and patient outcomes, which requires further study.\n\nImplications of all the available evidence SARS-CoV-2 has substantial capacity to infect humans, and is capable of human-to-human transmission. Infection can lead to severe respiratory symptoms, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the mortality rate is around 2%. Combining imaging assessments with clinical and laboratory findings could help to identify SARS-CoV-2 infections early.

The images were assessed and the evolution of lesions rated as either no significant change, resolution, or progression, compared with the previous chest CT from the same patient (appendix 2 p 4). Decisions were reached by consensus.\n\nAnalyses were done with SAS software version 9.4. Distribution normality was assessed using the KolmogorovSmirnov test. Normally distributed data were presented as mean (SD), nonnormally distributed data as median (IQR), and categorical variables as frequency (%). CIs of proportions were calculated using the ClopperPearson method.

Among groups 2-4 (symptomatic patients), no significant differences in clinical parameters were found. Patients in group 1 had significantly lower mean concentrations of Creactive protein (6\u00b79 mg/L, p=0\u00b70051) and aspartate amino transferase (30\u00b72 U/L, p=0\u00b70026) than patients in the other three groups. Other laboratory findings did not significantly differ among groups, and the prevalence of underlying diseases was similar in all groups.\n\nAll patients had abnormal CT imaging features (appendix 2 pp 5-6). Although all lung segments can be involved, there was a slight predilection for the right lower lobe (225 (27%) of 849 affected segments among all patients). The mean number of segments involved among all groups was 10\u00b75 (SD 6\u00b74; range 1-18; appendix 2 pp 7-8), with significantly more segments involved in groups 2-4 (symptomatic patients) than group 1 (asymptomatic patients; p<0\u00b70001). Group could also be seen at this stage (appendix 2 pp 5-6).\n\nBy Feb 8, 2020, 62 (77%) patients had been discharged, with a mean interval between symptom onset and discharge of 23\u00b72 days (SD 6; range 12-41). 16 (20%) patients were still in hospital, and three (4%) patients had died (on days 12, 14, and 30, after hospital admission due to ARDS). Patient 1, who died on day 12 after admission, was a 60yearold man with chronic pulmonary disease (tuberculosis). The CT scan obtained from this patient on day 8 after symptom onset showed extensive ground glass opacities in both lungs, giving a white lung appearance ( figure 4) . The second patient who died (patient 2) was 73yearold man who had had type 2 diabetes for several years, and showed progressive radiographic deterioration on CT scans taken on days 3, 7, and 11 after symptom onset. Patient 3, who died on day 30 after admission, was a 77yearold man with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease. A CT scan showed mild pneumonia on day 5 after symptom onset in this patient (figure 5A), and two followup CT scans 10 days and 15 days later revealed rapid progression of the lung lesions with bilateral pleural effusions ( figure 5B, C) .\n\nFollowup CT images were obtained from 57 (70%) patients (36 from Wuhan Jinyintan hospital, and 21 from Union Hospital). 23 of these patients had two CT scans, 19 had three scans, and 15 had four scans available. Four patterns of evolution throughout the series of CT scans were observed among these 57 patients: initial progression to peak level, followed by radiographic improvement (type 1), seen in 26 (46%) patients (figure 6), of whom 24 (92%) patients were discharged from hospital (median stay 25 days [IQR 20-27]); radiographic deterioration (type 2), seen in 18 (32%) patients (figure 5), of whom two (11%) died (patients 2 and 3); radiographic improvement (type 3), seen in eight (14%) patients, of whom five (63%) were discharged from hospital (median stay 19 days [ ); and unchanged radiographic appearance (type 4), seen in five (9%) patients, all of whom were still in hospital at the cutoff date (Feb 8).\n\nThe Coronaviridae family of viruses includes six prev iously known humaninfecting coronaviruses, which are enve loped, nonsegmented, positivesense RNA viruses that are broadly distributed in humans and other mammals. 13 Although four of these coronaviruses cause only mild respiratory symptoms similar to the common cold, epi demics caused by two beta coronaviruses, SARS CoV in 2002 14, 15 and MERSCoV in 2012, involved more than 8000 patients and 1000 patients, respectively, 16, 17 with high mortality rates (10% for SARSCoV and 37% for MERSCoV). The novel coronavirus SARSCoV2 is the seventh member of the Coronaviridae family known to infect humans. The mortality rate of COVID19 so far is\n\nStacked bars show the proportion of patients in whom the predominant CT pattern was ground-glass opacity, reticular, mixed, or consolidation. Patients were grouped by time from symptom onset: group 1 (scan before symptom onset; n=15), group 2 (scan \u22641 week after symptom onset; n=21), group 3 (scan >1 week to 2 weeks after symptom onset; n=30), and group 4 (scan >2 weeks to 3 weeks after symptom onset; n=15). lower than that of SARS or MERS coronavirus diseases; however, SARSCoV2 is highly infectious and could be a significant health threat. In our study, the predisposing conditions for COVID19 pneumonia tended to be old age and medical comor bidities (such as chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, and other chronic diseases), similar to previous viral infections such as influenza H7N9. 18, 19 There was no obvious predilection for males or females in our cohort. However, another study reported that 30 (73%) of 41 infected patients were men. 5 This discrepancy might be due to the differences in demographic features and small cohorts. By Feb 8, 2020, three patients in our study had died, representing a mortality rate of around 4%. All deaths occurred in men older than 60 years who had underlying diseases, consistent with previous reports. 5 Thus, old age, male sex, and presence of comorbidities might be risk factors for poor prognosis.\n\nFever, cough, and dyspnoea were the most common symptoms in patients with COVID19 pneumonia, consistent with the manifestation of lower respiratory tract infections. By contrast, upper respiratory tract symptoms were less common in these patients, indicating that the cells targeted by the virus might be located in the lower airway. 5 Other nonspecific symptoms included dizziness, diarrhoea, vomiting, headache, and generalised weakness, which occurred in around 2-9% of patients. Notably, 15 cases of asymptomatic infection were discovered on the basis of abnormal lung findings on CT scans, suggesting that chest CT scans or serum antibody tests should be done in asymptomatic highrisk individuals with a history of exposure to patients with COVID19 pneumonia to facilitate early identification of the disease.\n\nIn our cohort, leukocytosis was detected in 26 (32%) patients and lymphocytosis in 54 (67%) patients. Concentrations of Creactive protein and serum amyloid A protein were elevated in most patients, as observed in previous betacoronavirus infections. 10, 11, 20 In the subgroup of asymptomatic patients (group 1), concentrations of Creactive protein (6\u00b79 mg/L) and aspartate amino transferase (30\u00b72 U/L) were lower than those in symptomatic patients.\n\nThe mean number of involved lung segments in our cohort was 10\u00b75, with the right lower lobes most commonly affected. This finding is similar to those of a previous radiological study of patients with H7N9 influenza infection. 21 This finding might be due to the anatomical structure of the trachea and bronchi: as the right bronchus is short and straight, the causative virus might tend to favour this location.\n\nThe extent of disease on CT scans showed a marked increase from the subclinical period through the first and second weeks after symptom onset, then decreased gradually in the third week. A previous study showed that the median time from onset of symptoms to mechanical ventilation was 10\u00b75 days (IQR 7\u00b70-14\u00b70) and to intensive care unit admission was 10\u00b75 days (8\u00b70-17\u00b70). 5 Thus, our findings indicate that the radiological evolution of COVID19 pneumonia is consistent with the clinical course of the disease.\n\nMost patients in our cohort showed bilateral lung involvement, with lesions mainly located peripherally and subpleurally with diffuse distribution. The predominant pattern was groundglass opacity, with illdefined margins, air bronchograms, smooth or irregular inter lobular or septal thickening, and thickening of the adjacent pleura. These imaging characteristics are nonspecific and bear some resemblance to those of SARSCoV [22] [23] [24] and MERSCoV infections. 25, 26 However, unlike SARSCoV infections, some patients in our study presented with pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, and round cystic changes on CT. Previous studies showed that the presence of pleural effusion in patients infected with MERSCoV or avian influenza H5N1 was a poor prognostic indicator. 25, 27, 28 Similarly, in one patient who died in our study (patient 3), a followup CT scans showed that he had developed bila teral pleural effusion. On the other hand, lymphadenopathy has also been seen in cases of H5N1 infection, 28 which can present as a rapidly progressive pneumonia that results in ARDS. Round cystic changes on CT might be associated with the process of resorption of consolidation; which might be explained by the infection causing damage to the alveolar walls and leading to pneumatoceles. Other findings included intralobular or interlobular septal thickening, and a crazy paving pattern. However, none of the CT features of COVID19 seem to be specific or diagnostic, and COVID19 pneumonia shares CT features with other noninfectious conditions that present as subpleural air space disease. For example, patients with bronchiolitis obliterans with organising pneumonia 29, 30 often show nodules (32%), 29 lymphadenopathy (13%), 30 and pleural effusion (20%). 30 These findings were present, albeit with lower frequency, among our patients with COVID19 pneumonia (nodules 6%, lymphadenopathy 13%, pleural effusion 5%). However, treeinbud signs, masses, cavitations, and calcifications, often suggestive of bacterial or chronic infections, were absent in our study. The typical pattern of CT images in subclinical patients (group 1) was unilateral, multifocal, predominantly groundglass opacities. In the first week after symptom onset (group 2), lesions quickly evolved to bilateral, diffuse disease, with a relative decrease in the frequency of groundglass opacities and a transition to consolidation and mixedpattern development. Pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were also detected in group 2. Sub sequently, groundglass opacities continued to decrease in frequency throughout the second week after symptom onset (group 3), while consolidation became the second most common pattern. A reticular pattern associated with bronchiolectasis and irregular interlobular or septal thickening were also noted to increase pro gressively from the second week. These findings indicated the appearance of interstitial changes, suggesting the development of fibrosis. However, since the natural history of COVID19 pneumonia is yet to be fully explored, it is too early to label these lung changes as irreversible fibrosis. As the disease progressed in the third week after symptom onset, consolidation and mixed patterns became more common, while groundglass opacities decreased further. Bronchiolectasis, thickening of the adjacent pleura, and pleural effusion mainly appeared at this stage.\n\nSerial CT imaging of patients could help to con tinuously monitor disease changes. Followup CT showed pro gression or improvement of lung lesions during treatment, sensitively reflecting therapeutic effects, and these changes might be related to outcomes in such patients. The most common pattern of evolution throughout series of CT scans in this study was initial progression to a peak level, followed by radiographic improvement (type 1), and most of these patients were subsequently discharged. In addition, most patients who showed a pattern of radiographic improvement across several scans (type 3) were discharged from hospital. Thus, a type 1 or type 3 disease course might be associated with favourable outcomes. On the other hand, progressive radiographic deterioration despite medical treatment seems to be associated with poor prognosis, with two deaths in our study occurring among the 18 patients with the type 2 pattern.\n\nOur study had several limitations. First, at the time of data collection, nucleic acid testing for the diagnosis of SARSCoV2 infection had not yet been introduced at Union Hospital, and 33 patients were therefore diagnosed clinically on the basis of WHO criteria. 12 However, all these cases were confirmed by nucleic acid testing when kits became available later. Second, we compared imaging patterns between four groups of different time intervals from the onset of symptoms, which does not account for potential individual variations. Third, because of the short time for case collection, followup CT scans were available for only 57 patients, around 40% of whom had only two CT scans. Although we have outlined the main patterns of evolution seen on CT imaging in patients with COVID19 pneumonia, longterm radiological followup is needed to confirm our findings. Finally, as lung biopsy specimens were not available in this study, the relationship between radiological and histopathological findings remains to be investigated. Therefore, other potential causes of ground glass opacity, such as pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage, cannot be estimated.\n\nIn conclusion, COVID19 pneumonia tends to manifest on lung CT scans as bilateral, subpleural, groundglass opacities with air bronchograms, illdefined margins, and a slight predominance in the right lower lobe. Abnormal lung CT findings can be present even in asymptomatic patients, and lesions can rapidly evolve into a diffuse groundglass opacity predominance or consolidation pattern within 1-3 weeks after onset of symptoms, peaking at around 2 weeks after onset. Old age, male sex, under lying comorbidities and progressive radiographic deterio ration on followup CT might be risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with COVID19 pneumonia.\n\nHS, YF, and CZ conceived and designed the study.
