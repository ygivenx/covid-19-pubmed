{"title": "An improved method for detection of Edwardsiella tarda by loop-mediated isothermal amplifi cation by targeting the EsrB gene*", "body": "Edwardsiella tarda , which was fi rst isolated from a pond-cultured eel (Hoshina, 1962) , is a Gram negative bacterium belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family (Ewing et al., 1965) . E . tarda can cause serious diseases and even death in many commercially important species of freshwater and marine fi sh, and thus results in large economic losses to aquaculture worldwide (Thune et al., 1993) . Syndromes may include small cutaneous lesions that develop into large necrotic abscesses, ascitic fl uid in the abdominal cavity, swollen anus, enlarged kidney, and abscesses on internal organs (Plumb, 1999) . In addition to infecting fi sh, E . tarda has a wide host range, and causes diseases in a variety of species including humans (Michael and Abbott, 1993) , reptiles, birds (White et al., 1973) , and amphibians (Sharma et al., 1974) . To prevent and control this disease, a rapid, sensitive, and reliable technique for early diagnosis is needed.\n\nTraditional methods for diagnosis of bacterial disease are mainly based on phenotypic and serological properties of the pathogen or histological examination (Bernardet et al., 1990; Pazos et al., 1996) . These techniques have some disadvantages, such as the need for pathogen isolation, being time consuming, and having low sensitivity. In the past two decades, several PCR-based assays that provide quicker identifi cation than traditional assays have been applied for the detection of E . tarda (Chen and Lai, 1998; Sakai et al., 2007; Lan et al., 2008; Sakai et al., 2009; Castro et al., 2010) . However, PCR assays have some intrinsic disadvantages that limit their application, such as requiring the use of PCR instruments, gel electrophoresis, and imaging systems.\n\nLoop-mediated isothermal amplifi cation (LAMP) is a novel method that can detect a few copies of nucleic acids with high sensitivity, specifi city, and rapidity under isothermal conditions. The LAMP reaction employs a DNA polymerase with high strand displacement activity and a set of four primers that recognize six distinct sequences on the target DNA (Notomi et al., 2000) . Nagamine et al. (2002) developed an accelerating LAMP method that employed two additional loop primers. Specifi cally, the developed loop F primer (LF) and loop B primer (LB) provide an increased number of starting points for DNA synthesis. E . tarda detection by the LAMP method using a set of four primers designed based on the hemolysin gene has been reported by Savan et al. (2004) , who also optimized the LAMP reaction conditions for this detection.\n\nRecently, the E . tarda type III secretion system (T3SS), which contains 35 open reading frames (ORF), was reported and demonstrated to play an important role in bacterial pathogenicity (Tan et al., 2005; Mo et al., 2007) . Therefore, identifi cation of the T3SS gene now makes it possible to identify pathogenic E . tarda strains. Here, we report an improved LAMP method for detection of pathogenic strains of E . tarda that uses two additional loop primers targeting the E . tarda EsrB gene, which encodes a regulator protein of the type III secretion system (Tan et al., 2005; Mo et al., 2007) . Additionally, the EsrB -LAMP reaction conditions, including the Mg 2+ concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time were optimized. In addition, the sensitivity, specifi city, and applicability of this assay were discussed.\n\nThe bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 were conserved in the laboratory and cultured in 2216E media (5 g/L tryptone, 1 g/L yeast extract, 0.1 g/L FePO 4 , 34 g/L NaCl, pH 7.6-7.8) at 28\u00b0C. Staphylococcus aureus , Salmonella enteritidi , Shigella fl exneri , Listeria monocytogen , Escherichia coli , and Bacillus subtills were cultured in low salt Luria-Bertani medium (LB, 10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L NaCl, pH 8.0) at 28\u00b0C. All bacteria had been stored at -80\u00b0C in corresponding media containing 15% ( v/v ) glycerol before use in this study. E . coli competent DH5\u03b1 strain harboring plasmid used in this study were cultured in high salt Luria-Bertani medium (LB, 10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L NaCl, pH 7.0) at 37\u00b0C.\n\nThe bacterial genomic DNA was prepared using a TIANamp Bacteria DNA Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions and the direct boiled cells method , with minor modifi cations. Briefl y, for the direct boiled cells method, 1 mL of log-phase cultured bacterial broth ( E . tarda 1101) was centrifuged at 5 000\u00d7 g for 3 min to form a pellet. The pellet was then resuspended in 250 \u03bcL TE buffer (10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, pH 8.0), boiled for 5 min at 95\u00b0C, and centrifuged at 5 000\u00d7 g for 8 min. Next, the supernatant was collected and used for comparison of the detection sensitivity of EsrB -LAMP and Hemolysin-LAMP.\n\nFish tissue total DNA was extracted from 5 mg of the kidneys and guts of infected and healthy Scophthamus maximus or Paralichthys olivaceus using a QuickGene DNA tissue Kit S (Fujifi lm, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nThe EsrB -LAMP primers ( Table 2) were designed from the E . tarda genomic DNA sequence (GenBank accession number CP001135.1) using Primer Explorer version 4 ( http://primerexplorer.jp/elamp4.0.0/ , accessed on Nov. 12, 2011). A set of four primers (two inner and two outer primers) recognizing six distinct regions on the conservative target-gene sequences (F1c, F2, F3, B1c, B2, and B3) was designed to detect the target genes of EsrB . The forward inner primer (FIP) was composed of F1c, a TTTT linker, and an F2 sequence, and the backward inner primer (BIP) consisted of B1c, a TTTT linker, and a B2 sequence. Two additional loop primers (LF and LB) were (Fig.1 ).\n\nThe EsrB -LAMP reaction was conducted according to the method described by Notomi et al. (2000) , with minor modifi cations. Briefl y, the reaction was conducted in a 25 \u03bcL reaction mixture containing 1.6 \u03bcmol/L each of FIP and BIP, 0.2 \u03bcmol/L each of F3 and B3, 0.8 \u03bcmol/L each of LF and LB, 1\u00d7ThermoPol reaction buffer (20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 10 mmol/L KCl, 2 mmol/L MgSO 4 , 10 mmol/L (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 , 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.8), 6 mmol/L MgCl 2 as the additional Mg 2+ , 1.2 mol/L Betaine, 1.4 mmol/L of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 1 \u03bcL (8U) of Bst DNA polymerase, and 0.5 \u03bcL of bacterial genomic DNA (10 ng/\u03bcL ) as the template. After denaturation of the template at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, the mixture was incubated at 63\u00b0C for 1 h and then inactivated by incubation at 80\u00b0C for 5 min.\n\nNext, 2 \u03bcL of EsrB -LAMP products were visualized by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. To optimize the EsrB -LAMP reaction, different total Mg 2+ concentrations, reaction temperatures, and reaction times were investigated. Gel images were taken using an LAS3000 (Fuji Film, Japan) gel imaging system. The optimal reaction conditions for EsrB -LAMP were used in subsequent experiments.\n\nThe specifi city of the EsrB -LAMP assay was tested using genomic DNA extracted from nine E . tarda strains, six marine Vibrio bacteria ( V . splendidus , V . alginolyticus , V . harveyi , V . parahaemolyticus , V . fi scheri , and V . anguillarum ) and P . tetraodonis , S . aureus , S . enteritidi , S . fl exneri , L . monocytogen , E . coli , and B . subtills as templates. After the reaction, 2 \u03bcL of LAMP amplifi ed products were analyzed on a 2% GeneFinder\u2122 (BIOV, Xiamen, China) stained agarose gel.\n\nThe amplifying specifi city was confi rmed by sequencing the EsrB -LAMP product. To accomplish this, a LAMP product of approximately 500 bp was used as the template in PCR. The PCR reaction mixture (50 \u03bcL) consisted of 1 \u03bcL DNA template (50 ng/\u03bcL ), 25 \u03bcL 2\u00d7Premix Ex Taq (Ex Taq 1.25 U, 0.4 mmol/L each dNTP, Ex Taq buffer including 4 mmol/L Mg 2+ ) (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), and 1 \u03bcL each of FIP and BIP primers of the EsrB genes (20 \u03bcmol/L ). The amplifi cation was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 4 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 30 s and extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s and then fi nal extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. DNA fragments were subsequently purifi ed from agarose gels using a Zymoclean\u2122 Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo, USA), after which they were ligated with the pGM-T EasyVector System (Tiangen, Beijing, China) and cloned into E . coli DH5\u03b1 cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. Next, recombinant plasmids containing DNA inserts were sequenced using the M13 universal primers (forward primer, RV-M: 5\u2032-GAG CGG ATA ACA ATT TCA CAC AGG-3\u2032, reverse primer, M13-47: 5\u2032-CGC CAG GGT TTT CCC AGT CAC GAC-3\u2032). Finally, ClustalX 1.83 was used to analyze and align the sequences with sequences selected from GenBank using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST).\n\nTo determine the sensitivity of EsrB -LAMP and conventional PCR assay, a plasmid containing the EsrB gene fragment was constructed. First, the target EsrB DNA fragment was amplifi ed from the E . tarda 1101 genomic DNA using a pair of primers (forward: 5\u2032-GAT GCC GAT GCC AGA CAA-3\u2032, reverse: 5\u2032-AAA GCC CGC AGC AAA CC-3\u2032) designed from the E . tarda genome (GenBank: CP001135.1). The PCR reaction mixture was the same as that described in Section 2.5. PCR was then conducted by subjecting the samples to the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 4 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 60\u00b0C for The sequence of the cloned insert was verifi ed as described in Section 2.5. Ten-fold serial dilutions of the recombinant plasmid (pGM-EsrB ) were subsequently used as templates to evaluate the detection sensitivity of EsrB -LAMP and conventional PCR assays. The results were confi rmed by electrophoresis and the sensitivity of two detection protocols was compared. The conventional PCR amplifi cation program was performed as described above. The sensitivity of LAMP was also examined using template DNA obtained from 10 0 to 10 5 CFU of E . tarda . This were achieved by conducting a ten-fold serial dilution of 3.0\u00d710 8 CFU E . tarda in distilled water by using the direct boiled cells method. After the reaction, 2 \u03bcL of LAMP and PCR amplifi ed products were analyzed on 2% and 1.5% GeneFinder\u2122 (BIOV, Xiamen, China) stained agarose gel, respectively.\n\nTo compare the detection speed and sensitivity of EsrB -LAMP and hemolysin-LAMP , a hemolysin-LAMP assay that targeted the hemolysin gene of E . tarda was carried out using the reported primers, reaction mixture, and optimal conditions (65\u00b0C for 45 min) described by in parallel with EsrB -LAMP. After the reaction, 2 \u03bcL of LAMP amplifi ed products were visualized in 2% agarose gel.\n\nIn the clinical application of the EsrB -LAMP assays for detection of E . tarda , 5 ng of DNA templates were extracted from diseased Scophthatmus maximus (No. 2009122103-2 and -4) and Paralichthy solivaceus (No. 2009102801-2 and -4) intestine tissues, in which the presence of E . tarda had been confi rmed based on a TaqMan real-time fl uorescent PCR assay targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The templates were then used in a PCR assay targeting the EvpC gene followed by sequencing analysis (data not shown). In addition, 5 ng of genomic DNA from E . tarda 1101 was used as a positive control. Moreover, 5 ng of DNA samples extracted from healthy S . maximus (No 2009122104) and P . olivaceus (No. 2009122105) intestine tissues that had been confi rmed free of E . tarda as described above (data not shown) and distilled water were used as negative controls. The fi sh samples were obtained from a local farm in Yantai, Shandong Province, China in 2009.\n\nThe LAMP assays were visualized by adding 0.5 \u03bcL of the fl uorescent dye GeneFinderTM (10 000\u00d7) to 25 \u03bcL reaction mixtures as described by Zhang et al. (2009) . Positive or negative results were determined based on different fl uorescent colors of the reaction mixtures upon completion of the reaction.\n\nThree crucial components of the EsrB -LAMP reaction, Mg 2+ concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time, were optimized using E . tarda genomic DNA (2.5 ng) as the template. The amplifi cation effi cacies with Mg 2+ concentrations of 2 to 14 mmol/L were tested at 63\u00b0C. No amplifi cation product was produced when the total Mg 2+ concentration was less than 6 mmol/L (2 mmol/L MgSO 4 plus 4 mmol/L MgCl 2 ), while the clearest ladder of multiple bands appeared at 8 mmol/L Mg 2+ (Fig.2a) . LAMP products decreased when the total Mg 2+ concentration increased to 10 and 16 mmol/L; thus, the optimum total Mg 2+ concentration is 8 mmol/L. The characteristic ladder of multiple bands appeared at temperatures ranging from 55\u00b0C to 69\u00b0C, but the strongest and clearest ladder was observed at 61\u00b0C (Fig.2b) . Under the optimum conditions of 8 mmol/L Mg 2+ at 61\u00b0C, the fi rst amplifi ed product was produced in 15 min, but better results were observed after 40 min (Fig.2c) . Based on these results, the optimum reaction conditions for EsrB -LAMP were 8 mmol/L total Mg 2+ , 61\u00b0C, and 40 min. Therefore, these conditions were used in the subsequent experiments.\n\nDNA samples prepared from E . tarda strains, Vibrio strains, P . tetraodonis , S . aureus , S . enteritidi , S . fl exneri , L . monocytogen , E . coli , and B . subtills were used as templates for the EsrB -LAMP specifi city tests and positive results were only observed upon analysis of reaction mixtures containing the E . tarda templates (Fig.3a, b) . Moreover, sequence analysis revealed that the sequence of the PCR product 600 CHIN. J. OCEANOL. LIMNOL., 30(4), 2012\n\nVol.30 amplifi ed from LAMP products as the template with FIP/BIP primers was identical to the targeted EsrB gene of E . tarda (GenBank: CP001135.1) (data not shown).\n\nEvaluation of the detection sensitivity of EsrB -LAMP using 10-fold serial dilutions from 10 0 -10 7 copies of quantifi ed pGM-EsrB plasmid DNA revealed that it was 10 copies within 40 min (Fig.4a) , while the detection sensitivity of PCR tested using the same templates was 10 3 copies after 35 PCR cycles (Fig.4b) . Consistent with the results from the DNA samples prepared from pGM-EsrB plasmid DNA, characteristic ladder-like pattern products were detected from the diluted samples of 10 CFU within 40 min (Fig.4c) . Thus, the detection minimum of the EsrB -LAMP was 10 copies of the targeted gene or 10 CFU E . tarda , which was 100 times more sensitive than conventional PCR.\n\nThe reaction speeds of EsrB -LAMP and hemolysin-LAMP were compared using the same template (Fig.5) . The fi rst visible banding pattern was produced within 30 min upon EsrB -LAMP analysis, whereas the visible banding pattern was produced within 50 min during hemolysin-LAMP analysis. In addition, the degree of brightness and clarity of LAMP amplifi cation products on agarose gel indicated that more amplifi cation products were produced after 50 min of amplifi cation by EsrB -LAMP than by hemolysin-LAMP. Thus, the EsrB -LAMP was more sensitive and rapid than the hemolysin-LAMP assay, which is in accordance with the results reported by Savan et al. (2004) . , 3 000, 2 000, 1 500, 1 000, 900, 800, 700, 600 , 500, 400, 300, 200 and 100 bp, Beijing Solarbio, following the same); a. Effect of additional Mg 2+ concentrations on the LAMP reaction at 63\u00b0C. Lanes 1-7: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 mmol/L additional Mg 2+ , respectively; b. Effect of temperature on the LAMP reaction with 8 mmol/L total Mg 2+ ; Lanes 1-9: reaction temperature at 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67 , and 69\u00b0C, respectively; c. Effect of reaction time on the LAMP reaction with 8 mmol/L total Mg 2+ at 61\u00b0C; Lanes 1-8: reactions lasted for 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 min, respectively. \n\nThe LAMP reaction was made visible by direct addition of diluted fl uorescent dye to the reaction mixture. Following addition of the dye, the mixture in reaction tubes containing the positive control and DNA extracts from intestine tissues of E . tardainfected S . maximus and P . olivaceus became green, whereas the mixtures in tubes containing negative control and DNA extracts from healthy fi sh tissues remained the original orange color (Fig.6) . These observations agreed with the results of gel electrophoresis (data not shown).\n\nUsing two additional loop primers in the LAMP method could reduce the reaction time by about half when compared with LAMP without these loop primers (Nagamine et al., 2002; Parida et al., 2004; Tomoko et al., 2004; Yano et al., 2007) . However, due to the different characteristics of sequence fragments, it is not always possible to design additional loop primers for the LAMP primer set. To date, no studies of the application of loop primers to LAMP detection of E . tarda have been conducted. In this study, we successfully designed a LAMP primer set as well as a pair of loop primers for the EsrB gene, which plays an important role in the pathogenicity of E . tarda . In addition, we developed an accelerated EsrB -LAMP assay for identifi cation of E . tarda . The results of this study demonstrate that the EsrB -LAMP assay can effectively shorten detection times. Specifi cally, the amplifi cation product of the E . tarda DNA template could be detected after 15 min using 2.5 ng template\n\nThe pGM-EsrB plasmid DNA were used as templates in Fig.4a and 4b . DNA template prepared by the boiling method was used in Fig.4c . a, c. LAMP detection within 40 min; b. PCR detection after 35 cycles. Lanes 1-8 in Fig.4a and 4b: 10 0 , 10 1 , 10 2 , 10 3 , 10 4 , 10 5 , 10 6 , and 10 7 copies of plasmid DNA, respectively; Lanes 1-5 in Fig.4c : 10 0 , 10 1 , 10 2 , 10 3 , and 10 4 CFU of E . tarda , respectively; M: 100 bp plus DNA ladder marker.\n\nAll products in the reaction tubes were dyed by adding 0.5 \u03bcL of fl uorescent dye GeneFinder TM to 25 \u03bcL reaction mixture. Tube 1: E . tarda 1101 DNA (5 ng); tube 2: water; tubes 3 and 4: DNA extracted from healthy S. maximus (No. 2009122104) and P. solivaceus (No. 2009122105) intestine tissues, respectively; tubes 5 and 6: DNA extracted from E . tardainfected S . maximus (No. 09122103-2 and -4) intestine tissues, respectively; tubes 7 and 8: DNA extracted from E . tarda -infected P . olivaceus (No. 2009102801-2 and -4) intestine tissues, respectively. DNA. When compared with the hemolysin-LAMP assay developed by Savan et al. (2004) , the EsrB -LAMP is more sensitive and requires 20 min less time.\n\nSince the Mg 2+ concentration could affect primer annealing and DNA polymerase activity (Yeh et al., 2005; En et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2009) , we optimized the Mg 2+ concentration in the LAMP reaction. The results revealed that different Mg 2+ concentrations strongly infl uenced the amplifi cation reaction, and that the optimal total Mg 2+ concentration for EsrB -LAMP was 8 mmol/L. These fi ndings were consistent with previously reported ranges of 6-16 mmol/L (Noritaka et al., 2003; Kono et al., 2004; Yeh et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2009) . Temperature optimization tests showed that Bst DNA polymerase could function at 55-69\u00b0C, which is also consistent with previous reports (Notomi et al., 2000; Iwamoto et al., 2003; Ihira et al., 2004; Poon et al., 2004) .\n\nWhen compared with conventional PCR, the EsrB -LAMP assay showed obviously higher sensitivity for the detection of E . tarda . The EsrB -LAMP method was 100 times more sensitive than PCR conducted for 35 cycles, which is comparable to the results of previous studies (Tomoko et al., 2004; Mao et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2009) . Analysis of template DNA obtained from nine E . tarda strains and thirteen other bacterial strains using the EsrB -LAMP assay demonstrated that this method had very high specifi city for E . tarda strains. Sequence analysis of the LAMP amplifi cation products confi rmed the specifi city of the primers used for E . tarda . Overall, these results indicate that the EsrB -LAMP assay is highly reliable for identifi cation of E . tarda .\n\nAlthough the LAMP reaction yielded a white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate as a byproduct, as described previously (Mori et al., 2001; Pillai and Bonami, 2006) . However, the precipitate might not be clearly visible, which may result in confusion about whether the target DNA was amplifi ed. To address this issue, visual inspection of LAMP amplifi cation products obtained using DNA extracted from the tissue samples of S . maximus and P . olivaceus as templates was carried out by adding fl uorescent dye to the reaction mixture. The positive and negative reactions could be clearly determined with the naked eye based on the color of the reaction mixture. Furthermore, by sealing a drop of fl uorescent dye under the lid in advance, we successfully established a patented method (patent number: ZL 2010 1 0147946.2) for staining without opening the tube lid. This method is a good approach to avoid contamination of LAMP products and prevent false positive results, which are a common problem during LAMP tests (Aryan et al., 2010) . Thus, the EsrB -LAMP assay could also be developed into a closed reaction system for diagnosis, which would be practical for use in the fi eld.\n\nIn conclusion, we developed a quick and sensitive EsrB -LAMP method for detection of E . tarda in culture isolates and fi sh tissue. This EsrB -LAMP assay is the fi rst LAMP protocol to use additional loop primers for the detection of pathogenic E . tarda . The LAMP reaction can be conducted under isothermal conditions and does not require any sophisticated instrumentation. Thus, the established EsrB -LAMP assays will have a wide range of applications for the detection of E . tarda in laboratories, farms, and marine cultures."}
