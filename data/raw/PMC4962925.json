{"title": "A systematic review of community-based interventions for emerging zoonotic infectious diseases in Southeast Asia", "body": "The 2004 WHO/FAO/OIE joint consultation on emerging zoonotic diseases defined such diseases as, \u201ca zoonosis that is newly recognized or newly evolved, or that has occurred previously but shows an increase in incidence or expansion in geographical, host or vector range\u201d.1 Avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Nipah virus, monkeypox, Hendra virus, and the lentiviruses that cause Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) are a few examples of the growing number of diseases that humans can contract from animals.\n\nThe Asia Pacific Region has, unfortunately, been at the epicentre of such epidemics. Over 30 new infectious agents have been detected in the last three decades, 75% of which were zoonotic.2 A number of factors contribute to these circumstances. The absence of effective surveillance and control programs, prevailing socio-cultural practices and weak public health and veterinary services infrastructure exacerbates the vulnerability of these settings. Other factors including climate change, environmental degradation, encroachment of humans on areas where wildlife exists, cohabitation of humans and food animals within households, and the mixing of species in live animal markets play a role in increased disease transmission.\n\nInfluenza remains a global priority with the potential to cause large, global epidemics. Approximately 10% to 15% of people worldwide contract influenza annually, with attack rates as high as 50% during major epidemics.3 In 2003 the SARS epidemic affected around 8000 people and killed 780. In 2006 a new avian H5N1, and in 2009, a new H1N1 \u2018swine\u2019 influenza pandemic threat, caused widespread anxiety.4\n\nIn addition to mortality and morbidity, zoonotic diseases have and are predicted to cause huge economic losses. The economic cost of the major outbreaks of new epidemic zoonotic diseases over the past decade, including SARS and H5N1 influenza, has been estimated to be $200 billion.4\n\nTo prevent and control zoonotic infections in Southeast Asia (SE Asia), a multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary approach, involving many levels of the health and non-health sector, is needed, which places a strong emphasis on both the early detection and early control of infectious disease outbreaks.\n\nEarly detection of disease outbreaks requires effective disease surveillance systems. Systems in developing countries face many operational challenges, including a lack of accurate and timely information exchange between local, provincial, national and regional levels, and inadequate human resource and laboratory capacity for speedy diagnosis. The WHO's Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases 2010 highlights the need for community involvement in surveillance.2 Zoonotic disease detection and control also depends on effective veterinary surveillance and the ability to contain outbreaks amongst animal populations, systems that are often poorly developed or non-existent in developing countries.\n\nJones et al.5 suggest that local targeted surveillance of at-risk people may be the best way to prevent large-scale emergence. Brownstein et al.6 in their discussion of web surveillance suggest that the use of news media and other non-traditional sources of surveillance data such as web-accessible discussion sites and disease reporting networks could facilitate early outbreak detection and increase public awareness of disease outbreaks prior to their formal recognition. May et al.7 review the evidence for syndromic surveillance systems in developing countries (systems utilising existing clinical data prior to a diagnosis) and find that this may be a feasible and effective approach to infectious disease surveillance in developing countries.\n\nThe effectiveness of surveillance systems in responding generally to emerging infectious diseases has not been reviewed systematically. Reviews aimed at particular contexts (for example, prevention of bioterrorism8 and public health surveillance for trachoma2) have been undertaken, however, neither review was able to state whether surveillance systems are achieving the ultimate goal of detecting outbreaks early and providing an accurate picture of infection rates in the area covered by the surveillance program.2\n\nMost evaluations of surveillance programs have been qualitative, and focused on evaluating the practical structure and operation of the system, rather than the impact on infectious disease transmission.9\u201311 Many researchers have used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guideline which recommends how a surveillance system can be assessed to verify if it meets its objectives.12 This provides a framework for evaluating how well a system is functioning and determining reasons why it may or may not be functioning to detect and respond to infectious disease outbreaks and/or support ongoing control activities to tackle endemic diseases.\n\nThe CDC guideline recommends that reports of surveillance systems include the following:\n\nControl of emerging infectious disease requires an effective response to surveillance data. Single measures such as the use of vaccines or antiviral drugs may be unavailable, unaffordable or not in sufficient quantity. The control of these infectious diseases in resource constrained settings is more likely to be influenced by community-based and behavioural change interventions as well as by strengthening of national and international commitment to their control.13 Over the last decade there have been increased efforts to promote community-based infectious disease control.2\n\nFor vector-borne infections, such as dengue, attention has been focused on interventions to reduce larval, and ultimately adult, vector populations. Programs have attempted to achieve this via a range of chemical, biological and physical interventions to reduce vector populations, as well as trying to initiate behavioural change at the community level to prevent contact with the mosquito vectors.14 Heintze et al. have previously reviewed the evidence for community-based dengue control programs.15 This systematic review completed in 2005 found at that time that the evidence for these activities was weak and inconclusive and suggested a number of priorities for future research in this area. However, the review has not since been updated.\n\nCommunity-based interventions to control the spread of respiratory viruses, such as influenza, have focused on hygiene and respiratory etiquette to prevent human-to-human transmission. Many of these interventions have only been evaluated in a developed country context. Aledort et al.16 and Jefferson et al.13 undertook systematic reviews of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. Both reviews found handwashing was effective whilst there was no evidence to support school/workplace closure. However, these findings are from a predominantly North American context and may not be generalisable to countries with limited access to safe water and sanitation.\n\nTo understand whether community-based control activities will be effective and why requires us to look at the behavioural mechanisms through which these interventions work and the context in which they are based. Behavioural mechanisms operate through the experiences, beliefs and values of groups and individuals. These mechanisms are therefore dependent in part on the context in which they are used. This framework was used in a recent synthetic review of water and sanitation projects.17 The framework is shown in Figure 1.\n\nThe objective of this review is to identify the effectiveness of surveillance systems and community-based interventions in identifying and responding to emerging and re-emerging zoonotic infections in SE Asia.\n\nIt aims to provide a critical review of published evidence that evaluated the effectiveness of community-based surveillance and prevention and control interventions for emerging zoonotic infectious diseases. In addressing the three research questions outlined below we will summarise evidence for not only the effectiveness of community surveillance and prevention and control interventions in SE Asia in identifying and responding to these infectious diseases, but also explore the contextual factors that influenced their success.\n\nMore specifically the review questions were:\n\nThis review considered studies that evaluated interventions that are non-pharmaceutical, non-vaccine, and community-based. Community-based is defined as implemented outside a healthcare institution with at least one component of the intervention targeted directly at the community (e.g. educational meetings, involvement of local leaders). Interventions with no community participation (i.e. top-down vector control programs) were excluded as they were outside the scope of this project.\n\nThe review was limited to the ten member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)18: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam, and the following diseases of interest developed from the list of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic infections published on the CDC website19 as commonly occurring in Southeast Asia:\n\nInterventions of interest included, but were not limited to:\n\nSurveillance Interventions: syndromic surveillance programs, communications programs, training/education of health workers and community workers to detect and/or prevent disease, local level surveillance & response teams, web surveillance. Following the One Health20 concept of a synergistic approach to health we will also include animal/livestock surveillance systems where they are specifically evaluated with respect to their impact on human health and disease outcomes.\n\nControl Interventions (subcategorised into the following):\n\nHealth promotion interventions: self-reporting of suspected infections, promotion of voluntary self isolation, advocating use/provision of personal protective equipment, e.g. masks, public/community education on hygiene and respiratory etiquette, safe slaughter and preparation of animals and animal products (in particular poultry),\n\nPhysical interventions: contact tracing, isolation, quarantine, social distancing, barriers, school/workplace closure, movement restriction,\n\nEnvironmental interventions: environmental cleaning, waste disposal, coverage or removal of water containers, vector control, larval control including larvivorous fish and copepods, destruction of potentially infected animals and animal products\n\nPrimary outcomes A range of different outcomes used in the studies were examined. For the purposes of this review, they can be broadly categorised into primary and secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes aim to measure the incidence of infection or disease in the community. We considered studies that reported any type of quantitative infection/disease/outbreak outcome data or morbidity and mortality rates attributable to the infectious disease. This includes the following types of primary outcome measures: rates of infection, numbers of cases of infection reported and confirmed mortality rates attributable to the infectious disease, rates of hospitalisation attributable to the infectious disease, number of outbreaks, time/size of epidemic peak, duration of outbreak/epidemic.\n\nSecondary outcomes: To help contextualise our findings and address review question three, we also extracted any information on other indicators relating to the functioning of the surveillance and/or control program. These indicators can be used as intermediate outcomes to predict how the intervention might impact on infection or disease. For example, an intervention program may not show a reduction in disease but may result in an improved capacity for detection and containment of outbreaks or high levels of vector control. We categorised indicators based around the WHO framework for the monitoring and evaluation of surveillance and response systems for communicable disease21 and categorise these as secondary outcomes:\n\nFollowing the recommendations of the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Review Group (EPOC),22 which is concerned with evaluating interventions in community healthcare settings, only studies that provide evidence that draws a comparison between an intervention setting and a non-intervention setting were included. A second inclusion criterion was that the study must report results as quantitative infection/disease/outbreak data (as described under types of outcomes). We aimed to include studies reporting original primary data or systematic reviews of this type of evidence (i.e. not theoretical model based studies).\n\nAcceptable study designs included: systematic reviews/meta-analyses, randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after trials, interrupted time series (we require only one time point before and after the intervention). We also accepted mixed-method studies that included one of the above, and systematic review and economic evaluations that were based on one of the above. Conference papers, clinical observations, program reports with only one time point and non-systematic overview articles were excluded.\n\nThe quantitative component of the review extracts data from included studies on all disease outcomes and process indicators measured. This information is used to address review questions 1 and 2.\n\nThe textual component of the review considers the textual information included in the introduction, methods and discussion of all papers included in this systematic review. This is used to supplement the quantitative information on process indicators and address review question 3.\n\nStudies published in any language with an abstract available in the English language were considered for inclusion in this review. Studies were assessed for inclusion based on title and abstract only; with studies only translated if they met inclusion criteria. Studies published between 1980 and 2011 were considered for inclusion in this review, with a start date of 1980 chosen as surveillance programs in most SE Asian countries commenced in the early 1990s. By including data from 1980, we hoped to capture any information on community-based surveillance and intervention programs that may have contributed to the development of formal surveillance programs.\n\nThe databases searched included: PubMed, CINAHL, ProQuest, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, Science Direct, the Cochrane Library of systematic reviews, the WHO library database (WHOLIS), British Development Library, LILACS, World Bank (East Asia) and the Asian Development Bank. Further details on the search strategy are given in Appendix I.\n\nQuantitative papers selected for retrieval were critically appraised by two independent reviewers prior to inclusion in the review using standardised instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) (Appendix II). Any disagreements arising between the reviewers were resolved through discussion, or in consultation with a third reviewer.\n\nQuantitative data was extracted from papers included in the review using a data extraction tool specifically developed for this review that is shown in Appendix III. The tool was drafted during protocol development and piloted on a subset of studies across the five diseases. Based on this, a number of modifications were made to the tool to facilitate comparison across the diverse study types included in the review. The final tool still captured key details about the interventions evaluated and the methods and outcomes used in the evaluations, but to make extraction of contextual information easier for reviewers, the prescriptive categories used in the tool presented in the protocol were removed and replaced with three broad categories: contextual factors, behavioural mechanisms and program structure and delivery. These modifications allowed reviewers to capture the diverse range of factors reported in the studies and aided with categorisation of studies for the narrative analysis of findings.\n\nData was extracted on details about the interventions, populations, and study methods, program context and other outcomes of significance to the review question and specific review objectives. This included both disease outcomes and process indicators as described above to enable us to look at both the effectiveness and function of the programs.\n\nTo enable us to comment better on why programs have been (un)successful, we collected both quantitative data (i.e. process indicators) and qualitative data constituting narrative evidence or speculation by the authors on why interventions have been effective or not and any comment on sustainability. Textual data was extracted from the papers included in the quantitative review to capture the following specific details about the context and mechanisms of the program relevant to the review question and specific objectives:\n\nComparable study findings from individual studies were combined statistically in a meta-analysis. This approach allowed us to increase the power of the analysis, improve the precision of our estimates of an intervention and assess whether an intervention was similar in similar situations. The relative homogeneity in results across the different types of intervention supported this decision. Upon review of the data from the included studies, we elected not to use the Frequentist meta-analysis built into the JBI-MAStARI statistical software (as originally outlined in the review protocol). We decided against this standard approach, which calculates odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using the Mantel-Haenszel test as the default meta-analytical method for dichotomous data, in favour of a Bayesian approach that calculated odds or rate ratios with 95% credible intervals, for several reasons.\n\nThe Bayesian meta-analysis adjusts for multiple individual or repeated results from the same study (for example, results from two or more villages or from the same village at two or more time points) by using a random study effect, rather than combining the results across villages (for example, summing the total incidences and samples across all control villages and across all intervention villages). This accounts for instances where combining villages might be problematic (e.g., villages in high and low risk areas) and also adjusts for the fact that multiple within-study results are likely to be correlated and should not be entered as independent studies in a meta-analysis, nor should they be combined to give a study average, as this ignores the potentially valuable between-result heterogeneity (eg. villages in high and low and high risk areas). Standard meta-analysis software cannot model repeated results from the same study and is therefore likely to give a less accurate estimate. The Bayesian meta-analysis also easily copes with zero cells, for example, no positive results from a control village, which was not uncommon in studies of small sample sizes. Information about the underlying statistical assumptions and full set of equations and priors for the meta-analysis of binomial data has been included in the full meta-analysis report in Appendix VII, as well as the raw numbers used to generate the odds and rate ratios presented in the results section.\n\nThere were two types of dependent data in our analysis:\n\n1. Counts of the number of successes and failures, for example, the number of containers that tested positive for mosquitoes and the total number of containers tested. These were modelled using a binomial distribution. The meta-analysis of count data weights all results by study size. Results were expressed as odds ratios.\n\n2. Failure rates, for example the number of containers that tested positive for mosquitoes per 100 sampled. These data were modelled using a Poisson distribution. These data often did not provide information on the denominator used to calculate the rate so studies were unable to be weighted by study size in the meta-analysis. Results were expressed as rate ratios.\n\nThe meta-analysis was easily fitted in R using the R2WinBUGS software version 1.4.323 and a Bayesian model with a random intercept for each study. We plotted the means and 95% credible intervals for the odds or rate ratios using the \u2018forestplot\u2019 function in the \u2018rmeta\u2019 library of the R software.24 We generated plots at both the study and result level to visually show both the between-study and between-result variability. Odds ratios or rate ratios under one meant the intervention was effective; odds or rate ratios over one meant the intervention was not effective.\n\nUncertainty in estimates is expressed as a 95% credible interval, a standard approach in Bayesian statistical analyses, which has an interpretation similar to a 95% confidence interval (as would be calculated in the standard Frequentist meta-analysis orginally outlined in the protocol). A credible interval contains a 95% probability of containing the true estimate, in comparison to 95% confidence intervals, whose correct interpretation relies on imagining repeating the study multiple times, calculating multiple confidence intervals, and then counting the number of times the true estimate is contained in the intervals. Credible intervals therefore have a far simpler interpretation.\n\nDue to the small numbers of studies reporting common outcomes, we were unable to carry out the planned sub-group analyses (which were by intervention type, urban/rural context and country). Instead, we pooled results across intervention types for meta-analysis, and a \u201cleave one study out\u201d sensitivity analysis was used to show the influence of each study on the summary odds or rate ratio when there were more than two studies. The relative homogeneity in results supported this decision.\n\nThe following definitions were used to classify outcome measures in the meta-analysis:\n\n114 papers were short-listed for comprehensive examination from the original list of 1694 (Figure 2). The majority of the original articles (103) and six systematic reviews were excluded after reading the abstract and an overview of the contents of the paper. The full text articles of 16 studies were retrieved. Reasons for exclusion are outlined in Appendix V and included narrative reviews or descriptive analyses that did not present any data, model-based studies or cross-sectional knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) or seroprevalence surveys with no intervention evaluated. Of the 16 full text articles, six studies were assessed for methodological quality and one was excluded at this stage82 as it only measured one time point. Five studies have been included in the review (Table 9), two studies from the Philippines on oral canine vaccination in owned dog populations50, 67 and studies from Thailand54, Malaysia68 and Indonesia81 all describing retrospective data from rabies control programs in response to an outbreak of rabies or an increase in the number of human rabies deaths.\n\nFrom the included papers, data were available for surveillance activities in only two studies54, 68 Details of the interventions evaluated and the main findings from each included study are presented in Table 10 and Table 11. The study by Kamoltham et al.54 presents the number of potentially exposed cases who received treatment from rabies treatment centres, hospitals and clinics in Phetchabun province, and report that rabies is a notifiable disease in Thailand. A census of the dog population and canine vaccination coverage was also carried out by the Livestock Department of Phetchabun during the program, although this appears to have been on an ad hoc basis collected specifically for the elimination program. The study by Soon et al.68 presents veterinary surveillance data carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture and also mentions surveillance of human cases of rabies infection by the Ministry of Health, as part of the Malaysian National Rabies Control Program. They do not mention how the outbreak was detected or whether any form of surveillance was in place prior to the outbreak. Furthermore, neither of these studies present an analysis or evaluation of their surveillance programs, other than to show a decrease in the number of deaths from rabies infection54 or to say there was a \u201cdecrease in the number of rabies deaths\u201d after the interventions.68\n\nThe studies in the Philippines50, 67 and Indonesia81 do not mention ongoing rabies surveillance. The outbreak on Flores Island was reported by word of mouth by local fishermen when three dogs died.\n\nControl interventions discussed in the five included studies included canine vaccination,50, 54, 67, 68, 81 sterilisation,54 culling of the dog population,81 public health education,54, 67, 68 movement restriction of infected dogs68 and quarantine of newly introduced dogs.68 Details of the interventions evaluated and the main findings from each included study are presented in Table 10 and\n\nTable 11. All evidence on control interventions looked at effectiveness of canine vaccination, administered either through oral baits50 or by direct injection.50, 54, 67, 81 The study by Kamoltham et al.54 mentions canine sterilisation, but no data is presented on the latter. Although some interventions included a health education/awareness component,54, 67, 68 this was only evaluated by Robinson et al. The study by Windiyaningsih et al.81 does present data on culling of the dog population in an outbreak setting, although data for all provinces where the intervention was carried out was not recorded. Overall, the available evidence is low quality, and outbreak data is based predominantly on the analysis of a case series using historical controls. The outcome measure used in three studies is the proportion of dogs vaccinated.50, 67, 81 Kamoltham et al.54 and Windiyaningsih et al.81 also report on human disease indicators such as the number of cases of human rabies. In both studies, attempts to evaluate the impact of the intervention on the numbers of rabies exposures in humans are confounded by concurrent expansion of a cheaper and safer rabies treatment regimen. In the Thai study54, despite the aggressive vaccination campaign from 1996 \u2013 2001, the number of exposures to suspected and proven rabid animals continued to increase from 1992 \u2013 2000. Inability to enforce movement restrictions of animals, culling of diseased animals and incomplete vaccination coverage contributed to failure to control the outbreak on Flores Island.81\n\nA number of studies reported how behavioural mechanisms by community members and the public impacted on the success of the study. Details of contextual factors extracted from each included study are presented in Table 12. Robinson et al.67 observed that pre-campaign education and advertisements contributed to the success of the program and that good information dissemination impacted on the likelihood to vaccinate. Dogs were more likely to be vaccinated if the household had received campaign information from more than one source (OR=4.45, CI not provided, p=0.04, statistical test not stated), and less likely to be vaccinated if the household had learned of the campaign primarily through posters (OR=0.30, CI not provided, p=0.015, statistical test not stated). Poor understanding of vaccination also contributed to refusal to participate (the perception that the vaccine altered the meat if a dog was kept for consumption).\n\nGood engagement of the community was also vital for the uptake of vaccination, particularly for the owned dog population, as owners had right to refuse. Other reasons for refusing to participate included the owner not wanting to cause injury to the dog from vaccination. Estrada et al.50 also reported a reluctance of owners to have dogs repeatedly bled. The study may also have been compromised as a result of dog owners demanding financial compensation for dogs handed over for rabies diagnosis. Reluctance by members of the public to kill dogs in the Flores Island outbreak81 perpetuated the outbreak, as some owners moved their dogs to rabies-free districts or sold them at markets to avoid killing them. The practice of fishermen travelling with their dogs and subsequently visiting other islands also aided the spread of outbreak.\n\nBoth Kamoltham et al.54 and Windiyaningsih et al.81 mention decentralisation of services in Thailand and Indonesia impacting on the ability to obtain complete data in the former and to control the spread of the outbreak in the latter. Lack of coordination between local authorities made it difficult to contain the infected dog population and prolonged the outbreak. Higher level support and the involvement of the authorities was essential in the success of outbreak control measures because some form of law enforcement was required,68 particularly where no one claimed ownership such as the stray dog and common dog population.\n\nIn summary, no evidence was available for routine human or veterinary surveillance activities, nor an analysis or evaluation of an existing surveillance program for Rabies. All evidence on control interventions looked at the effectiveness of canine vaccination. Although some interventions included a health education/awareness component, this was only evaluated in one study. Overall, the available evidence is of low methodological quality, and outbreak data is based predominantly on the analysis of a case series using historical controls. The outcome measure used was the proportion of dogs vaccinated in three studies. In one study, attempts to evaluate the impact of the intervention on the number of rabies exposures in humans are confounded by concurrent expansion of the rabies treatment regimen. A number of studies highlighted the importance of pre-campaign education and advertisements to impact on the success of the program, as well as coordination of local services and higher-level support to conduct a successful campaign.\n\n89 papers were short-listed for more comprehensive examination from the original list of 534 (Figure 2) of which seven studies were critically appraised for methodological quality and subsequently included in the review (Table 13). Reasons for exclusion are outlined in Appendix V and include papers which were: review articles which did not present any data on interventions, prevalence surveys, risk factor studies, and clinical and outbreak reports.\n\nTwo studies were outbreak reports of the Malaysian outbreak epidemic29, 30 and present an epidemic curve of the number of human cases by the date of onset of their illness. Four studies also discussed the National Swine Surveillance Program and subsequent control measures initiated by the Malaysian Government in response to the outbreak.26, 36, 37, 40 In the final study,25 authors discuss an active surveillance initiative for the detection of Nipah virus infected swine in Indonesia.\n\nAll published evidence included in this systematic review on surveillance and control interventions is based on the outbreak response in Malaysia and Singapore in 1999. Subsequent to 1999, Nipah virus was identified as causing clusters of disease in humans in India and Bangladesh,83 countries which are outside the scope of this review.\n\nDetails of the surveillance interventions evaluated and the main findings from each included study are presented in Table 14 and Table 15. From the included studies, no ongoing routine veterinary or human surveillance appears to have been in place in this region prior to the commencement of the outbreak. Human and swine surveillance was instigated in Malaysia as a measure of active case finding to guide outbreak control measures (the National Swine Surveillance Program).26, 36, 37, 40 Swine surveillance was also carried out in Indonesia25 in response to restrictions on the export of Indonesian pork by other Asian countries.\n\nThe National Swine Surveillance Program in Malaysia on farms was carried out till the end of December 2000 to detect and cull additional infected herds, and abattoir surveillance was continued in 2001 and 2002 of all pigs entering abattoirs.37 While there is evidence that the swine surveillance and subsequent control measures were effective, as Malaysia achieved a Nipah virus \u2013free status by the end of December 2001, no evaluation was carried out and no comment has been made on the feasibility and on\u2013going sustainability of this program.\n\nDespite descriptive reports of on-going surveillance activities such as animal tracking systems (coding of farms, ear tagging and tattooing) to aid trace back,36, 40 educational programs for farmers and health promotion campaigns,36 there are no studies that report quantitative data on the functioning of these systems and there has been no evaluation of these systems. Strategies of herd health monitoring and improved farm management practices were also briefly discussed by Mohd Nor.36\n\nA number of control measures were discussed in the seven included studies, which included mass culling, quarantining, movement restrictions, education about contact with pigs and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Details of the interventions evaluated and the main findings from each included study are presented in Table 14 and Table 15. All interventions were government driven, with involvement from volunteers from non-governmental organisations, farmers and members of the public.37\n\nEvidence is indicative that infected pigs were required to sustain transmission, based on the decline in the outbreak following movement restrictions on the farmed pig population, culling of infected herds and in the case of the Singaporean outbreak, bans on the importation of pigs from Malaysia by the Singaporean government. However, the evidence included in this review is low quality and based predominantly on the analysis of a case series using historical controls.\n\nWhile there is mention of the total estimated loss to the swine industry in terms of cost,37 there is no information on the cost of the interventions. The sustainability and feasibility of using these interventions outside of an outbreak situation has not been discussed. The study by Muniandy outlines some future challenges to the swine industry in Malaysia, and makes recommendations for long term reform.37\n\nDetails of contextual factors extracted from each included study are presented in Table 16. Several of the studies discussed the enormous impact this outbreak had on the pig industry in Malaysia.26, 29, 36, 37, 40 The eradication of 1.1 million swine represented about 40% of the swine population in Malaysia in 199929 and the number of farms were reduced from 1885 to 829 farms.36 Many pig farmers lost their livelihoods with the culling of their entire pig farm.\n\nThe outbreak caused dramatic changes in the pig industry, with pig farming only allowed in pig farming areas designated by the government. Restrictions on pork products and live pig exportation of Indonesian pigs by governments of Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines prompted the Indonesian government to initiate swine surveillance in Indonesia to restore faith in the Indonesian swine industry.\n\nThe transmission of Nipah virus was thought to be related to the movement of fruit bat populations in farming areas with the risk of greater exposure of pig farms to foraging fruit bats, although this has not been confirmed.37 The authors have suggested that intensification of traditional farming systems, particularly of pigs and poultry, has contributed to environments that enhance transmission of diseases from wildlife reservoirs. Furthermore, while intensification and expansion have been on-going, biosecurity measures, the lack of environmental impact assessments, inadequate pollution and waste management practices have left much to be desired.\n\nMuniandy et al. also recommends changes locally.37 They refer to a traditional practice amongst pig farmers in Malaysia of sharing boars and moving sows from farm to farm and recommend that this practice be discontinued. In fact, it was the fire sale of sick pigs from one farm in Perak that was thought to be responsible for the initial spread of the outbreak.30\n\nOzawa et al. also discussed difficulties encountered by the trace back system in abattoir surveillance, pointing to irregularities with the tattooing system.40 Farm codes were tattooed on the back of the animals stamped by the butchers themselves. Ear notching was later introduced to circumvent fraud.\n\nIn summary, there was no evidence of a surveillance system in place to provide early warning of the outbreak. The only surveillance activities described were initiated in response to the outbreak to guide control measures in Malaysia, and as an active case finding exercise in Indonesia. All evidence on control interventions is based on the outbreak response in Malaysia, which included mass culling, quarantining, and movement restrictions. There is no information on the cost of the interventions. The sustainability and feasibility of using these interventions outside of an outbreak situation is likely to be low, and there is no evidence for more sustainable ongoing activities such as animal tracking systems or health promotion campaigns. Despite many reports of ongoing surveillance activities there has been no evaluation of these systems.\n\nThe original searches retrieved 1302 potentially relevant articles. This included 15 systematic reviews which were identified during this stage and the reference lists for these were examined for additional references. From this list, 118 papers were short-listed for more comprehensive examination. 87 articles were rejected after perusal of the abstract and full text. Reasons for exclusion are outlined in Appendix V and include papers based on: cross-sectional surveys or reports of surveillance activity with no intervention, narrative reviews with no original data and model-based studies. Thirty-five papers were critically appraised for methodological quality and based on these, 31 papers were included in the review (Figure 2). The studies were categorised by country, urban/rural setting and type of intervention to facilitate analysis. Characteristics of the included studies are detailed in Appendix IV (Table 17 to Table 20).\n\nSix studies evaluated the effectiveness of community-based surveillance programs for dengue. These studies came from different countries (Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Viet Nam, Cambodia and Malaysia). 28, 31, 32, 38, 39, 41 Two studies evaluated established national level systems,28, 32 whilst the remaining four were evaluations of novel or improved systems undertaken at a more local/regional level.31, 38, 39, 41\n\nTwenty-six studies report on 28 evaluations of dengue prevention and control activities. Much of the evidence for community based dengue interventions comes from studies undertaken in Thailand47, 49, 58, 64\u201366, 71, 72, 74, 76, 79 (n=11) and Viet Nam38, 52, 53, 55\u201357, 61, 62 (n=8). Within these countries, studies have been undertaken in a wide range of regions so evidence is available from northern, central and southern provinces. The remaining studies were undertaken in Singapore44 (n=1), Malaysia48 (n=1), Myanmar76 (n=1), Cambodia69 (n=1), the Philippines59, 76 (n=2) and Indonesia45, 70, 77 (n=3).\n\nThree studies evaluated community dengue health education and disease awareness campaigns.45, 64, 74 A further thirteen studies44, 47, 49, 55\u201357, 61, 62, 66, 69\u201372 used educational components in conjunction with a combination of environmental, biological and occasionally chemical vector control. Five studies48, 52, 70, 71, 77 evaluated environmental control strategies (including use of screens, covering of water containers, and community clean up to reduce larval breeding sites), the majority included an educational component. A further eleven studies44, 49, 55\u201359, 61, 62, 66, 72 included environmental control activities alongside chemical or biological control interventions. Seven studies55\u201358, 61, 62, 65 looked at biological vector control strategies (including introduction of either copepods or other biological control agents to water containers); in all studies this was in combination with dengue education and environmental control activities. Eleven studies38, 44, 47, 49, 53, 59, 66, 69, 72, 76, 79 looked at chemical vector control strategies (including larvicide/insecticide distribution and fogging), either in isolation or occasionally combined with either dengue education or environmental control activities.\n\nSix studies looked at different aspects of the functioning of dengue surveillance activities. Details of the interventions evaluated and the main findings from each included study are presented in Table 18 and Table 19. One study evaluated a passive surveillance system in terms of its ongoing functioning for monitoring endemic dengue,31 three studies looked at active surveillance of suspected dengue cases,38, 39, 41 whilst the other two evaluated the ability of surveillance data to predict or provide early warning of outbreaks or epidemics of dengue which occur periodically in endemic areas.28, 32 Outcomes used in these studies include the number of dengue cases and/or incidence rates, predictive ability of the system (generally in terms of outbreak or epidemic warning), and sensitivity and specificity of the system. One study41 reported data on the cost of the surveillance system.\n\nThe evaluation by Chairulfatah et al. was of the local surveillance system in Bandung, Indonesia.31 The authors reported significant underreporting of hospital cases to the local Municipal Health office (only 31% reported). Poor record keeping impacted on assessment of the system's timeliness. No other qualities of the system were evaluated (representativeness, positive predictive value). The studies on active surveillance systems evaluated systems based on community reporting38, 39 and a sentinel GP surveillance pilot to detect suspected dengue cases.41 The study by Osaka et al.38 was inconclusive, as it seemed to be set up to look at the impact of concurrent interventions (done in conjunction with active surveillance) rather than improved surveillance, as both the intervention and control group received the active surveillance component. No information was provided on the increased cost of active surveillance. Oum et al.39 used syndromic surveillance definitions to conduct community-based surveillance on a number of diseases, including \u2018haemorrhagic fever\u2019 (HF). Their evaluation showed value in their approach, as only 33% of cases of HF had contacted a health facility, with 67% of them being treated at home, although they do not estimate a predictive value positive (PPV) for their definition of HF. The majority of deaths (80%) also occurred at home. The surveillance system also detected two clusters of HF reported in one commune. Other system attributes were not evaluated. The sentinel GP pilot41 compared a sensitive versus more specific case definition of suspected dengue cases presenting to two clinics. The more specific case definition uses diagnostic criteria for DHF outlined by the WHO, so it is not surprising that a higher proportion of patients were positive by serology (33% vs 7%) and virus isolation (50% vs 15%) using the latter case definition.\n\nBarbazan et al. used retrospective surveillance data to show that the spatial analysis would allow focusing control activities on 5% of the months to control 37% of cases, and early warning of epidemics could have been done in advance.28 Chan et al. used web search query data to build a model that estimated \u2018true dengue activity\u2019.32 They showed good correlation of their predictive model with retrospective data using datasets from Indonesia and Singapore.\n\n26 studies report on 28 evaluations of dengue control activities. Interventions evaluated were based on a variety of methods including environmental, biological and chemical vector control, as well as dengue disease awareness campaigns and health education activities. Details of the interventions evaluated and the main findings from each included study are presented in Table 18 and Table 19.\n\nThree studies evaluated purely dengue education programs which did not include any other control activities.45, 64, 74 Two of these studies, undertaken with textile factory workers in Indonesia45 and a rural community in Thailand,64 focused on evaluating measures of community engagement with the program as opposed to changes in vector indices or disease outcomes. Both showed an increase in knowledge amongst participants about dengue symptoms and transmission, and awareness about how to reduce vector breeding habitats. Therawiwat et al.74 (also undertaken in a rural Thai community) measured both knowledge and larval indicators. They showed significant increases in knowledge and self efficacy in control of dengue, along with a 90% reduction in larval indices by the end of the study. No data are presented by any of the studies on whether effects translated into any impact on the number of cases of dengue.\n\nFour studies evaluated environmental control strategies. One study looked at the provision of new water tanks with solid covers;52 this study showed a reduction in larval indices (average number of larvae per container) in the new tanks, but no impact on larval indices in old existing containers at the study site. Overall there was not a significant reduction in larval indices. The new tanks showed high levels of acceptability amongst the community. The other three studies looked at the effectiveness of environmental cleanup campaigns in combination with dengue education and awareness activities.48, 70, 71 Crabtree et al. used a strategy based in schools and the general community with use of mass media and targeted activities to promote community awareness.48 They found a 60% reduction in the number of households in the intervention area positive for Aedes aegypti, however, the vector was not present in the control area at baseline, which effectively meant that there was no control group. The number of households positive for Aedes aegypti increased toward the end of the study period. Suroso et al. used a predominantly school based strategy to promote clean up amongst the wider community.70 They found a 50% reduction in larval indices in households, but only a 35% reduction in households with school children and school buildings. They concluded the program had been less successful amongst school children. Suwanbamrung et al. conducted their study in three semi-urban communities and used targeted community education activities to promote clean up campaigns.71 They showed a 50% reduction in household index and an 80% reduction in container index in the village with high levels of community engagement and dengue control capacity. In the two villages where capacity and engagement were lower they demonstrated only a 15% reduction in these larval indices. None of these studies reported data on the cost of the intervention or provided follow up beyond one year to look at sustainability.\n\nSeven studies evaluated a dengue control program that included use of biological control agents. One study65 is a pilot study of the use of Larvitab\u00a9 (larvicidal bacteria) in a rural location in Thailand and includes no educational or environmental activities. The study reported a 70-85% reduction in larval indices and a 75% reduction in adult mosquito indices (as compared to only a 10% and 35% reduction respectively in the control group). The other six studies evaluated the use the copepod Mesocyclops as a biological control agent in water containers and also included health education and disease awareness, and environmental cleanup activities as part of the control program. One of these was a study undertaken in urban Thailand58 that found that the percent of containers positive for larvae went from around 38% to close to 0%, mosquito landing numbers went from around 1 to close to 0, and the percentage of children screened who were dengue sero positive went from 13.5% to 0%. In contrast the percentage of positive containers and children increased in the control area.\n\nThe other five studies evaluating copepods came from Viet Nam and were conducted by the same research group over a period of 15 years in a variety of rural and urban settings across North and Central Viet Nam. This group includes four original trials conducted in different communes55, 56, 61, 62 and a follow up study looking at the cost and sustainability of the interventions up to nine years post-intervention.57 The intervention was very comprehensive including use of copepods, environmental cleanup campaigns, the use of microcredit schemes to encourage development of recycling business, and broad community education activities and awareness campaigns. In all four original studies the intervention achieved a reduction in vector indices, reducing larval populations by over 97% 12 months post introduction of copepods and achieving 99% reduction or elimination with the addition of community education and environmental cleanup activities. The studies also reported a reduction in dengue incidence and this was also maintained with no project communes reporting local cases of disease (only a handful of imported cases) since 2003. In contrast larval population and dengue numbers remained present in control areas with figures fluctuating with the seasonal and epidemic nature of the disease. Participants reported a 99.5% rate of willingness to participate and a 97.8% acceptance of copepods.56 The average cost per person per year of the original program was estimated at $US2, with a marginal cost of expansion of 20c.55 In the follow up study, the average cost of the program was calculated to be 61c per person per year (equivalent to a total cost of $6,134 annually) in International Dollars.57 Using a self-developed tool to measure sustainability they found that the project rated 4.42 out of 5 indicating it was highly sustainable.57 Rates of both vector indices and cases of dengue remained at zero in the original project communes over five years after the end of the original research study.57\n\nEleven studies evaluated some form of chemical control (including insecticides, larvicides, fogging or spraying programs, or use of impregnated nets or curtains). Five of the studies which evaluated chemical methods of control also had an environmental cleanup component to the intervention to reduce vector breeding habitats.47, 49, 59, 66, 76 There was no systematic difference in effectiveness between these studies and those not including this component. Three studies looked at the use of impregnated nets or curtains.53, 59, 79 The two studies evaluating nets showed a significant reduction in adult vector indices53 and larval vector indices59 but were not able to show a reduction in dengue infections as measured by dengue serology.53 Madarieta et al. reported a significant increase in the number of people using non-intact nets or not using nets consistently over the six month study period.59 Vanlerberghe et al. showed that curtains were well accepted by the community79 but correct use was not sustainable \u2013 follow up observations noted nets with tears/holes, nets not hung and nets being used for other purposes (e.g. storage). No information was presented on dengue infection numbers or costs.\n\nFour studies evaluated the use of a chemical larvicide (Temephos\u00a9) in water containers,47, 66, 69, 76 one study evaluated the effectiveness of fogging or spraying of insecticide targeted at the adult vector44 and two studies evaluated a combination of larviciding and spraying.49, 72 Of these seven studies, five measured outcomes in terms of larval indices, of which four studies showed that use of larvicides or insecticides reduced larval indices by between 50-80%.47, 66, 72, 76 The remaining study, which evaluated use of this method of control during an outbreak as opposed to within an ongoing control program, was not able to show any impact on larval indices.49 Only one study47 measured the impact of larviciding on mosquito landing rates and was not able to demonstrate any impact for the intervention. Three studies reported outcomes as numbers of dengue infections.44, 66, 69 All showed a reduction in dengue cases, of around 50% in urban areas and 80% reduction in the one rural area studied.66 Ang et al. reported that the impact of dengue spraying on dengue notifications was greatest during an outbreak than under endemic conditions.44 Two studies provided data on cost and sustainability. Suaya et al. estimated the cost of an annual larviciding program in Cambodia at 11c per person covered.69 Phantumacinda et al. reported that they only achieved 70-86% coverage in their larviciding program.66\n\nThree studies compared different types of dengue control. Umniyati et al. compared a program based on environmental cleanup with repeat insecticidal fogging in an urban setting in Indonesia.77 They found that the environmental cleanup intervention was more effective than the chemical control program in reducing larval and mosquito indices. Osaka et al. compared use of insecticidal aerosol cans with ultra low volume (ULV) fogging in an urban region of Viet Nam.38 They found that use of aerosol cans for household spraying was more effective (a 71% v. a 52% reduction in dengue cases) and less costly (US$393 v. $US553) than the fogging program.\n\nTun-Lin et al.76 looked at the use of vector control programs targeted at the most productive container types versus untargeted control programs in urban settings in Thailand, Myanmar, and the Philippines (note that data from Viet Nam was excluded from the review as there was no follow up at this site). In the Philippines, two forms of environmental control were compared. Tyre splitting, water drum cleaning and waste management was compared to a general community clean up and awareness campaign. In Myanmar, introduction of biological agents (dragon-fly nymphs and fish) to the most productive water containers was compared to a blanket approach where all containers were targeted and chemical control (Temephos\u00a9) was used intermittently. In Thailand introduction of a biological larvicide (Bti) to the most productive containers was compared to use of chemical control (Temephos\u00a9) in productive containers, plus regular emptying of all other containers and occasional insecticide spraying. In all three countries both the targeted approach and the non-targeted approach were equally effective at reducing entomological indices (Breteau index) by 80% in Myanmar and the Philippines and 50% in Thailand. Implementation costs were reported for Myanmar and the Philippines. In Myanmar, the targeted vector control program had lower implementation costs ($4.47 per year per household covered) than the non-targeted campaign to which it was compared ($6.45 per year per household). In the Philippines, the targeted intervention had higher implementation costs compared to the non-targeted campaign ($9.32 v. $2.19 per year per household). In the Philippines high levels of acceptance of the interventions were reported. Coverage of 70% and 73.5% was achieved in the Philippines and Myanmar respectively.\n\nGiven the larger number of studies identified that evaluated dengue surveillance or control activities, contextual information extracted from each study were grouped under the following headings for discussion: contextual factors, behavioural mechanisms, and program design. Within each of these broad headings, subcategories have been used to draw conclusions across studies. Details of contextual factors extracted from each included study are presented in Table 20.\n\nThere were geographical differences in the types of prevention and control interventions evaluated and the location of study sites. Sixteen of the 26 studies included study sites in rural locations. These studies came from Viet Nam52, 53, 55\u201357, 61, 62, Thailand47, 49, 58, 64\u201366, 74, Indonesia70 and Malaysia48, and looked at interventions that used a combination of health education, environmental vector control strategies (mainly focusing on reducing vector breeding sites) and biological vector control strategies (predominantly the introduction of copepods to both public and private water containers). Fourteen studies looked at the effectiveness of control programs in urban settings. This evidence came from Singapore44, Myanmar76, Cambodia69, Indonesia45, 77, Vietnam38, 55\u201357, 85, Thailand66, 71, 72, 79 and the Philippines59, 76 and was more likely to be evaluations of chemical forms of vector control (including use of insecticides in public water sources, fogging of dwellings and public buildings and promotion of use of insecticide treated nets).\n\nFour interventions were evaluated in both urban and rural settings; these were impregnated bed nets (a chemical intervention), larviciding (a chemical intervention) introduction of Mesocyclops to water containers (a biological intervention) and community cleanup campaigns (an environmental intervention). Similar levels of effectiveness for all of these interventions were achieved in both settings except larviciding which appeared to be more effective in rural area at reducing both vector indices and dengue rates. Phantumacinda undertook their study in both urban and rural areas of Thailand and had higher levels of volunteer participation in the urban areas.66\n\nUmniyati et al. compared source reduction of larval habitats with insecticide fogging in both the wet and dry season.77 Source reduction out-performed fogging at reducing larval numbers in both seasons. In relation to reducing mosquito numbers, source reduction was better than fogging in the dry season but in the wet season the two methods were equivalent. Swaddiwuhipong et al. found that a health education and temephos larviciding program was more effective in epidemic than inter-epidemic years.72 Ang et al. reported that the impact of dengue spraying on dengue notifications was greatest during an outbreak as opposed to under endemic conditions.44\n\nCrabtree et al. reported a lack of piped water supply and significant problems managing refuse due to lack of infrastructure in the rural coastal Malaysian villages as barriers to their environmental and educational program.48 Butraporn et al. reported poor wastewater management and a lack of affordability of piped water in their study as hindering the effectiveness of their chemical and environmental control program.47\n\nThe six studies 55\u201358, 61, 62 which included the use of copepods in their intervention commented that use of this method of control is applicable where the major breeding habitats for the vector are large water storage containers (which cannot be easily emptied and cleaned), that are used as stores from which smaller containers are refilled (thereby transferring copepods).\n\nNone of the included studies refer to specific models of behavioural change being used to design the intervention programs, however all of the studies make reference to the fact that the programs were designed to result in changes in practices to prevent dengue infection and transmission.\n\nBeckett et al. evaluated an education program and showed that improvement in knowledge scores was strongly correlated with educational level.45 Therawiwat et al. found that education level and being male were predictive of high knowledge scores.74 Kay et al.57 showed a direct link between the frequency of household visits by dengue program volunteers, household knowledge of dengue prevention and the practice of dengue control activities. They also found that use of copepods as a biological method of dengue control was less successful when not combined with health education and awareness building activities. Kittayapong found that dengue education was needed to ensure that the water container covers distributed in their intervention were used properly.58 Vanlerberghe et al., who evaluated use of insecticide treated curtains, found that disease knowledge was not correlated with uptake or correct use of the curtains79 and Butraporn et al. found that increased knowledge and awareness did not translate to increased use of Temephos\u00a9 in household water containers or improved waste management.47\n\nThe three studies authored by Kay et al.55\u201357 report that health volunteers in their interventions were paid a stipend of $US 2-4 per month (approximately 4 days of work) plus given a uniform. In the follow up study57 they report that these stipends were not motivation for the volunteers. This in fact stemmed from the prestige of the position which derived from the value assigned to these roles by the community based on the severity of dengue as a public health problem. In contrast, the village health volunteers in the surveillance system evaluated by Oum et al. were reported to be motivated because they were financially rewarded.39\n\nChairulfatah et al. states that the doctors in their surveillance system often wished to postpone reporting until a diagnosis of dengue was confirmed and health municipality officials were often asked to report only patients with obvious dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue septic shock.31\n\nBoth Butraporn et al.47 and Vanlerberghe et al.79 reported a link between perceived effectiveness of the intervention amongst community members and continued engagement in program activities, with a decline in the use of Temephos\u00a9 plus waste management and the use of impregnated curtains over the study period as participants failed to see reductions in mosquito and dengue rates.\n\nIn many studies, key community members were identified as leaders or champions for the program and these individuals were involved in developing the intervention and mobilising activities in the wider community. Kay et al.57 compared vector indices and dengue rates in project communes to those in communes which received a rollout of the intervention but which didn't offer communities the opportunity for local input and modification to the program prior to implementation. They report continued absence of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and reduced rates of dengue in the original project communes whilst the non-project communes had higher rates of both outcomes.\n\nIn the chemical control programs, community involvement in the intervention was generally passive, i.e. they received the program. The interventions were designed, coordinated and run by centralised agencies or teams. Community members' involvement was usually restricted to uptake of household strategies such as use of impregnated nets or larvicides, or allowing access to the household for spraying activities. In contrast, community involvement was active in the education, environmental and biological control programs. Community members were involved in the design and planning of environmental cleanup strategies, involved in development and delivery of the health education and disease awareness components of the program and trained and used for the distribution of biological agents and ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the programs.\n\nHigh levels of community ownership and involvement are consistently reported as an important factor in the success of these control programs; Crabtree et al. state that the grass roots community action promoted success of their environmental cleanup program48 and Suwanbamrung et al.71 reported that their community education and environmental cleanup campaign resulted in a significant reduction in vector indices in all three villages. However, the village with the highest community capacity for dengue control amongst leaders and the general community recorded the lowest entomological and epidemiological indicators. Nam et al.62, Nam et al.61, and Kay et al.55, all report that community leaders mobilised the whole community to take high levels of ownership of the program, which enabled a multi-level community approach to control. Nam61 report that continuous community input is required into their intervention based around use of copepods and environmental clean up to prevent reinfestation with the dengue vector. Vanlerberghe found that active engagement of the community in promoting continued use of impregnated curtains was more important in increasing uptake than continued educational messages about dengue.79\n\nCrabtree et al. report spin-off benefits to the community from participating in their intervention.48 These were increased civic pride, well-being, and more effective networking and self-advocacy with government agencies as a result of their environmental and education based program.\n\nSuroso et al. delivered their educational and environmental intervention primarily through schools.70 They reported lower reduction in vector indices in school premises and households with schoolchildren, relative to households with no school children, and attribute this to a lack of motivation amongst school children. In contrast, Phantumacinda et al. reported that students were better volunteers in their larviciding intervention than village participants,66 and Swaddiwudhipong et al. found that their education program was more effective in schools compared to private households and other public buildings.72 Kay et al. used schools as a key platform for delivering education and awareness activities to both school children and the wider community,55 highlighted the importance of school children in providing an important service to the community in the inoculation of copepods to water sources as necessary,57 and reported that teachers and school children were particularly important in the success of clean up campaigns.56\n\nCrabtree et al. reports that sustainability of their environmental control program in Malaysia is threatened by local attitudes that place responsibility with government agencies to address and enact positive changes in local environment and infrastructure.48 These attitudes undermine sustainability of changes to attitudes and behaviour regarding environmental clean up to reduce vector breeding habitats. This is in contrast to Nam et al.'s evaluation of a biological and environmental control program in Viet Nam which cites the importance of recycling as an economic activity as one of the reasons why clean up campaigns were so successful in reducing entomological indices.62\n\nFinancial support for all the surveillance systems came, at least in part, from international donors or commercial organisations. The study which evaluated the use of internet sources for rumour surveillance was sponsored by Google who provided access to the data and technical support.32Two studies commented on financial constraints to their surveillance system; Chairulfatah et al. reported that they could only perform serology tests as opposed to the more definitive recovery of virus tests in their system,31 whilst Osaka et al. reports that an extension of their system beyond a pilot would likely require use of cheaper serology testing.38\n\nAdequate investment and resourcing for both start up and maintenance was also frequently identified as an important factor for prevention and control interventions. Beckett et al. states that their budget was too low to enable them to reach all community members with their educational intervention.45 Eamchan et al. reports the high price of larvicidal agents (specifically Temephos\u00a9) as a potential barrier for ongoing use.49 Swaddiwudhipong et al. which had included this as part of their intervention was forced to drop it during the final (and epidemic) year of their intervention due to a lack of funds.72 Phantumacinda states that ongoing supply of Temephos\u00a9 is necessary as periodic mass campaigns are less effective and therefore not economical or practical.66 Phan-Urai et al. notes that Larvitab\u00a9 (like Temephos\u00a9) requires repeat dosing at regular intervals.65 In contrast, the six studies55\u201358, 61, 62 which included the use of copepods in their intervention stated that all control tools were locally produced including the copepods which can be farmed locally for minimal cost.\n\nThe cost to participants of the intervention may facilitate or inhibit success of the program. Hien et al. studied the use of new containers with solid lids that were provided free to the community.52 Whilst larval indices in these containers were low, the community continued to use many old containers and there was no overall reduction in larval indices. Kay et al.55\u201357 report their interventions included microcredit schemes for small businesses that were based around recycling and waste removal. These acted as catalysts for sustained environmental cleanup and some of the profits from these activities are reinvested into other dengue control activities.\n\nNone of the studies evaluating educational, environmental or biological control programs reported issues with acceptability of the program in community participants. Several studies specifically reported high levels of acceptability by the community.48, 55, 71 The use of copepods in water containers was also well accepted and reported as requiring minimal time and effort to sustain.57 Phan-Urai et al. reports how participants had no complaints about the use of Bti (a biological larvicide) in water supplies.65 The product was perceived as safe and preferable to Temephos (a chemical larvicide) which was thought to be oily and raised concerns about the use of chemicals in drinking water. Eamchan et al. and Phantumacinda et al. also reported issues with acceptability of Temephos, including smell, taste and not wanting to place the agent in drinking water.49, 66 Madarieta et al. and Vanlerberghe et al. both reported a decline in use or correct use of impregnated curtains over their study to less than 50%.59, 79 Igarashi et al. found that 100% of households found impregnated bed nets simple, convenient and comfortable to use.53\n\nTun-Lin et al. found that the targeted intervention used in Myanmar was less costly but equally effective as a non-targeted strategy, whilst in the Philippines, where a strong social intervention component was included in the program, the targeted intervention cost almost five times more than the non-targeted intervention for comparable levels of effectiveness in regards to reduction of vector indices.76 Kittyayapong et al. report that whilst targeted vector control could feasibly be rolled out beyond a research program in their Thailand setting it was likely to be too costly to implement.58\n\nWe included a number of outcome measures including household index, container index, Breteau index, the larval population number, larval density index, the mosquito biting rate and the number of cases of dengue infection. Definitions for each of these outcome measures are given in the methods section and further description of the meta analysis can be found in Appendix VII. The first five outcome measures measure Aedes aegypti larval populations in a number of settings (for example, in houses, in containers, as a total population number), the sixth measures the presence of adult mosquitoes, and the final is a measure of clinical infection with dengue virus. The studies varied in size from 61 to 6341 households and 1163 to 2.9 million people (represented by the size of the square in the forest plot), and covered a range of interventions, including environmental, educational, biological and chemical interventions, as well as a combination of more than one intervention.\n\nTen studies measured household index as an outcome measure. The meta-analysis showed that the dengue control interventions resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the household index giving a summary mean odds ratio of 0.21 (95% credible interval 0.05, 0.68) (\n\nTable 21). Despite the forest plot showing heterogeneity between studies, with Crabtree et al. and Madarieta et al. reporting that the intervention increased household index (Figure 3), the sensitivity analysis showed that the summary mean odds ratio was stable to the influence of each individual study.\n\nSix studies measured container index as an outcome measure. The meta-analysis showed that the dengue control interventions resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the container index, giving a summary mean odds ratio of 0.38 (95% credible interval 0.15, 0.94) (Table 22). The forest plot shows heterogeneity between the individual study findings, with Madarieta et al. reporting the intervention had no impact on container index (odds ratio=1) (Figure 3). However, the sensitivity analysis showed that the summary mean odds ratio was stable to the influence of each individual study.\n\nTwelve studies measured Breteau index as an outcome measure. The meta-analysis showed that the dengue control interventions resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the Breteau index giving a summary mean rate ratio of 0.40 (95% credible interval 0.26, 0.61) (Table 23). The forest plot shows homogeneity between studies (Figure 3), and the sensitivity analysis showed that the summary mean odds ratio was stable to the influence of each individual study.\n\nOnly two studies measured the larval population number. The meta-analysis showed that the dengue control interventions resulted in a non-significant reduction in the larval population numbers giving a summary mean rate ratio of 0.21 (95% credible interval 0, 156.9) (Table 24). The small number of studies is the reason for the wide credible interval. The forest plot shows homogeneity between the individual study findings (Figure 6). As there were only two studies, a leave one out sensitivity analysis was not performed.\n\nThree studies measured the larval density index. The meta-analysis showed that the dengue control interventions resulted in a non-significant reduction in the larval density index giving a summary mean rate ratio of 0.09 (95% credible interval 0, 11.51) (Table 25). The small number of studies is the reason for the wide credible interval. The forest plot shows homogeneity between studies (Figure 7), and the sensitivity analysis showed that the summary mean odds ratio was stable to the influence of each individual study.\n\nTwo studies measured the presence of adult mosquitoes by recording the mosquito bite rate. The meta-analysis showed that the dengue control interventions resulted in a non-significant reduction in the mosquito bite rate giving a summary mean rate ratio of 0.68 (95% credible interval 0, 634.83) (Table 26). The small number of studies may be the reason for the wide credible interval, as the forest plot shows homogeneity between studies (Figure 8). As there were only two studies a leave one out sensitivity analysis was not performed.\n\nSeven studies measured the rate of dengue haemorrhagic fever. The meta-analysis showed that the dengue control interventions resulted in a non-significant reduction in the infection rate giving a summary mean rate ratio of 0.22 (95% credible interval 0.02, 1.32) (Table 27). The forest plot shows homogeneity between studies (Figure 9), and the sensitivity analysis showed that the summary mean odds ratio was stable to the influence of each study.\n\nThe results of the meta-analysis showed that overall, the interventions included in this review were able to show a statistically significant impact on larval indices; including approximately an 80% reduction in the proportion of positive households, approximately a 60% reduction in the proportion of containers positive for Aedes aegypti larvae and approximately a 60% reduction in the Breteau index, when results are pooled across type of intervention. Although we anticipated being able to draw indirect comparisons of effectiveness between intervention types, the small number of studies for any one intervention type precluded formal sub-analyses to look at relative effectiveness. However, a narrative interpretation of the forest plots shows no trend in levels of effectiveness by type of intervention, country, urban versus rural context or study size.\n\nTwo studies48, 59 showed inconsistent results (an increase in larval indices as opposed to a decrease), but this difference does not appear related to the type of intervention. The study by Crabtree et al.48 trialled an environmental cleanup intervention; it is a low quality study that is weakened by its inappropriate choice of control area (the mosquito vector was not present in the control area at baseline). The study by Madarieta et al.59 was a small, short, low quality trial of insecticide impregnated bednets. A feature common to both studies that may partially explain their contradictory findings is that each reported problems with the sustainability of the intervention. After 6 months, 52% of nets were no longer in use and 60% of nets in use had been washed (reducing their insecticidal properties). At the end of the environmental cleanup study, the authors report ongoing waste management issues, and a failure to alter ingrained attitudes that the government should address these issues, rather than seeing them as a community responsibility.\n\nPooling of results across intervention types estimates that vector control results in approximately an 80% reduction in the rate of dengue haemorrhagic fever, however this result does not achieve statistical significance. Effectiveness does not appear to vary by country or urban/rural context. There is the suggestion of a slight trend to greater levels of effectiveness for interventions incorporating biological vector control methods56, 58, 61 versus chemical vector control methods38, 66, 69, 72, but this is not statistically significant. Only three studies56, 66, 72 included in the meta-analysis reported data on both larval and dengue outcomes. All showed consistency in the direction of the effect across outcomes, however all showed a bigger reduction in larval indices than number of dengue infections. This provides support for use of larval indicators as an intermediate outcome in evaluations of dengue control interventions, but suggests that they cannot be used to directly estimate the impact of the intervention on disease outcomes.\n\nA substantial body of evidence is available evaluating the effectiveness of dengue control interventions and surveillance activities. The available evidence comes from countries across SE Asia providing confirmation these programs work in a diverse range of geographical and social contexts. A wide range of vector control interventions have been evaluated, including chemical, biological and environmental methods of control. These have been evaluated both in isolation and in conjunction with health education and disease awareness campaigns. The majority of this evidence relies on entomological indices to evaluate programs (as opposed to disease outcomes). Duration of follow-up varied from one month49 to five years.55, 61\n\nA review of included studies evaluating surveillance interventions show that well-functioning surveillance systems can be successfully used to spatially and temporally predict dengue epidemics in Thailand. This result has not been replicated in other countries. Community based surveillance methods appear to offer improvements over hospital/clinical surveillance in terms of sensitivity of the system, particularly in settings where there are significant financial barriers to accessing healthcare that results in under-reporting of dengue case numbers.\n\nThe dengue vector is amenable to many forms of chemical, biological and environmental control. The meta-analysis showed that overall, the interventions included in this review were able to show a statistically significant 80% reduction in the proportion of positive households and a 60% reduction in the proportion of containers positive for Aedes aegypti larvae, regardless of the type of intervention. There was also a non-significant 80% reduction in the rate of dengue haemorrhagic fever.\n\nInterventions based on health education, environmental and biological vector control appear to be effective, low cost, well accepted, and sustainable in both urban and rural settings. Interventions based on chemical control in urban settings appear to be well accepted and there is evidence for effectiveness but they are expensive and there is limited evidence on their sustainability. A single study comparing environmental clean-up with repeat fogging found that environmental cleanup was more effective at reducing mosquito numbers than the chemical control program. A study reporting on evaluations in a range of countries showed that targeted environmental and larviciding interventions are as effective at reducing vector indices as blanket interventions and have lower implementation costs. Sub-group meta-analyses by intervention type or rural and urban settings were not possible because of the small number of eligible studies.\n\nKey factors for success in interventions that have shown sustained reductions in entomological indices and disease incidence are the use of behavioural change strategies within their education and awareness programs, combined with support and investment in ongoing environmental management, high levels of community ownership of the program, and sufficient investment and resourcing for both start up and maintenance. There have been few evaluations comparing types of control and the cost-effectiveness of these programs has not been evaluated.\n\nThe search strategy identified 854 potentially relevant titles, of which 110 were shortlisted (Figure 2), based on details in the title and abstract. 96 original references were excluded (reasons are given) in Appendix V and papers which were outbreak reports with no data included on interventions, narrative reviews with no original data, cross-sectional KAP surveys and model-based studies. Nine systematic reviews that were identified were also excluded, as these focused on either a geographical region outside of the scope of this review(either China, Hong Kong and/or North America), the use of pharmaceutical or clinical interventions (vaccines and lab assays for clinical diagnosis), or the prevention of nosocomial (as opposed to community) transmission. Full text of twenty studies was retrieved, of which five studies were critically appraised and subsequently included in the review (Table). Four of the five were from Singapore34, 51, 63, 73 with the remaining study originating from Viet Nam75.\n\nOf the papers included in this review, only a single study was identified that reported on ongoing surveillance systems for SARS.34 Details of the intervention and the main findings from the study are presented in Table & Table. The study evaluates the practicality of post-SARS surveillance recommendations in Singapore. The study focuses on the use of staff electronic medical records for early detection of outbreaks of febrile illness. Although the study is conducted in medical staff at a large general hospital, it is included here as it is being used as an early detection system for outbreaks rather than solely to prevent nosocomial transmission. The study finds that as documented fever is rare in sick leave amongst staff, passive surveillance in healthcare workers would be efficient in identifying outbreaks of febrile illness. Effective markers were found to be clustering of illness, prolonged or repeated absence from work, or the incidence of abnormally high fevers. The authors conclude that such a system is practical and likely to be sensitive in this setting should appropriate indicators be chosen, but that currently the system is not specific. This may lead to many false alarms and ultimately to outbreak \u201cfatigue\u201d whereby people fail to respond to early warning signals. The authors also note that surveillance is time-consuming and resource intensive.\n\nTan et al.73 provides descriptive information only about the use of temperature screening amongst school children during the epidemic. The study reports that none of the children diagnosed with SARS were detected through this system despite the extensive effort and resources this system required. They describe the benefit of this type of surveillance as psychological, with the purpose being to reassure parents and the public that schools were safe during the outbreak.\n\nFour studies reported on community-based interventions to prevent and control SARS. Details of the interventions evaluated and the main findings from each included study are presented in Table and Table. Three of the studies are from Singapore51, 63, 73 and evaluated the effectiveness of home isolation and quarantine protocols and its contact tracing policy. All of the studies were based on retrospective analyses of the same outbreak dataset. The three studies reach the conclusion that the system was effective as it was able to reduce the time from onset of SARS symptoms to isolation from nearly one week to just over a day. They showed that a wide-net approach (i.e. pre-emptive isolation of exposed individuals using a broad definition of exposure) to surveillance and isolation of suspected cases was effective in ensuring progressively earlier isolation of probable SARS cases as the outbreak progressed. They also saw a reduction in the number of secondary infections per case. Only 0.3% of those quarantined broke quarantine. One quarter of all SARS cases had been on quarantine orders prior to diagnosis. Only 0.5% of those isolated went on to develop SARS. It is noteworthy that these interventions were evaluated within an outbreak setting and that a range of other community-focused strategies were also put into place.\n\nA single study from Viet Nam75 is a risk factor analysis for SARS transmission in contacts of SARS cases in Viet Nam. The study looked at the effectiveness of masks in preventing transmission of SARS from index cases to known contacts (in particular household members and carers). Unfortunately this was a small observational study based on retrospective data and 95% of SARS contacts reported never wearing a mask, so no conclusions could be drawn about their effectiveness.\n\nDetails of contextual factors extracted from each included study are presented in Table31. Escudero et al.'s study of a work-based surveillance system acknowledges that electronic documentation of staff medical certificates were important in enabling the system to function in a timely manner and at low cost.34 The authors also highlight that the study coincided with admission of an isolated case of SARS contracted due to a laboratory accident, which may have both increased awareness of febrile illness amongst staff and improved participation and acceptance rates amongst staff members.\n\nAll four studies of prevention and control activities highlighted that there were particular epidemiological features of SARS that made it more amenable to control \u2013 namely that patients were only infectious whilst symptomatic.51, 63, 73, 75 This makes it easier to identify when and where interventions need to be put in place for infected individuals to prevent transmission. It may also increase uptake of interventions amongst non\u2013infected individuals as people are better able to judge their risk of infection.\n\nThe three studies evaluating isolation and quarantine policies in Singapore all stated that strong government/political leadership and high levels of community support were important factors in successful implementation of quarantine measures.51, 63, 73 Other factors identified by these studies as contributing to success in both implementing isolation and quarantine measures, and in halting the epidemic, were good and timely communication both between agencies and outward to the general public and substantial investment to develop information technology systems and laboratory systems capable of providing accurate and timely information over the course of the outbreak. Ooi et al. also highlights that Singapore has particular features (small population, high GDP, urban setting) that facilitate the ability to implement large-scale quarantine and states that \u201cimposition of large-scale quarantine should be implemented only under specific situations in which it is legally and logistically feasible\u201d.63\n\nOoi et al. gives useful information about the public and individual response to the isolation and quarantine policy, stating that stigmatisation of quarantined individuals was reported.63 Those quarantined were generally agreeable to being confined at home whilst the response was less positive to potential confinement in an institution such as a health centre. Finally, the study indicates that substantial resources were directed toward quarantined individuals, including repeat visits by nurses to deliver health education, the installation of electronic surveillance systems in each household to monitor compliance to quarantine orders, and the use of financial incentives to compensate individuals for lost income. All of these factors are likely to have contributed to the low rate of non-compliance reported in the study.\n\nThe study by Tuan et al.75 did not provide any contextual information about why people did not wear masks.\n\nFive studies were included in the review, one looking at a work-based surveillance system in a Singapore hospital, three evaluating the effectiveness of isolation and quarantine in Singapore as a response to the 2003 SARS outbreak, and one study from Viet Nam reporting on the effectiveness of masks in reducing risk of SARS in people exposed to SARS patients. Overall the evidence is low quality and based predominantly on analysis of case series data from the 2003 outbreak. All three studies that evaluated the impact of isolation and quarantine found this intervention to be effective, however, the major limitation in these studies is that they are all based on analysis of the same routine dataset, and none can control for the impact of the multiple other interventions that were put in place in Singapore at the time of the outbreak. The study reporting on use of masks was an observational study and was unable to comment on whether the intervention was effective as 95% of participants reported never wearing a mask. Important factors contributing to the success of isolation and quarantine policies were good organisation, adequate resources, good communication and public support.\n\nUnlike Nipah virus infection, where, to date, the outbreak in 1999 has been an isolated event in SE Asian countries, several outbreaks of avian influenza have been recorded in a number of SE Asian countries from 2004 to 2008. In line with our inclusion criteria, outbreak control measures for each country-specific outbreak were included as long as they had a significant component of community involvement and engagement, even if in concert with \u201ctop-down\u201d government-driven initiatives.\n\nThe search identified 737 potentially relevant titles, of which 107 papers were short-listed for comprehensive examination (Figure 2). Of these, eleven studies were critically appraised and nine studies were subsequently included in the review (Table 32). Reasons for exclusion are outlined in Appendix V, and include papers based on: outbreak reports with no data on interventions, narrative reviews with no original data, risk factor analyses, model-based studies and cross-sectional KAP and prevalence surveys.\n\nFive papers detailed surveillance initiatives, three of them27, 35, 42 presenting data for the same active surveillance program established in Indonesia in 2006. Details of the interventions evaluated and the main findings from each included study are presented in Table33 and Table 34. The studies by Jost and Azhar are early reports of the establishment of the system and a three year report of results, respectively.27, 35 A comprehensive evaluation was conducted by Perry et al. in 2009 as part of the FAO Evaluation Service.42 The evaluation detailed the establishment of \u201cparticipatory disease surveillance\u201d(PDS), based on principles of participatory epidemiology, i.e. the application of participatory methods to disease surveillance. Participatory epidemiology recognizes that local people have very rich and detailed knowledge about the animals they keep and the infectious and zoonotic diseases that affect their livelihoods and endanger human health. The system focused on the detection of HPAI in the backyard poultry sector (defined by the FAO as sector 4) on a village-wide basis by veterinary surveillance officers, where it was commonly believed the majority of HPAI virus was harboured. It was later expanded to have a prevention and control component. The program was successful in training up a number of Master Trainers, who subsequently delivered training to more than 2,000 surveillance officers. In its three years of operation, it was operational in 76% (341) districts in Indonesia, 27/33 provinces, covering 25,525 villages where surveillance activities had been completed,27 1455 of these resulting in diagnosis of HPAI. As of March 2009, infection status of villages was determined as \u2018infected with HPAI\u2019 (2.5%, 490/19,673), 8.1% (1598) suspected infected, 3.1% (612) controlled and 86.3% (16,973) apparently free of infection. The authors comment that the surveillance system enhanced existing passive surveillance systems and addressed a gap in surveillance.\n\nThe study by Desvaux et al. focused on targeted surveillance of markets, semi-commercial poultry farms located in former outbreak areas, sentinel village monitoring to strengthen surveillance at village level, and serological surveillance of domestic duck farms.33 The study did not detect HPAI in the market (0/712) or farm (0/51) samples. Market monitoring: samples were collected in seven provinces. Interviews were conducted in 52 villages and on 23 farms, which were subsequently classified according to their risk of having faced an HPAI outbreak. 14/70 (20%) premises were not suspected, 3/70 (4%) were classified as low probability, 18/70 (26%) were classified moderate probability, 35/70 (50%) high probability. The authors identified several constraints during the implementation of program that impacted on the success of the study \u2013 lack of motivation of provincial staff, limited capacity of the central team to compile and analyse the data generated, weak diagnostic capabilities and the reluctance of farmers to have animals sampled. They also state that selection of animals in market places was biased and that sample sizes were below defined levels and hence not representative, which may explain the zero detection rate of HPAI in markets and on commercial farms.\n\nThe study by Samaan et al. used rumour surveillance to analyse rumours generated primarily by the media and email and evaluate if the rumours could offer timely assistance to potentially affected nations, prompt countries to undertake preparedness measures, and inform public and international community about relevant events.43 Rumours were followed up by email or telephone request to the relevant WHO country office to investigate their veracity. A total of 40 rumours were identified from 20 countries and one Special Administrative Region. 23% of the rumours were confirmed to be true. The authors conclude that this type of surveillance was successful in informing public health action, and was relatively inexpensive to conduct.\n\nFive studies evaluated education based avian influenza prevention and control interventions. Details of the interventions evaluated and the main findings from each included study are presented in Table 33 and Table 34.\n\nFour studies were identified where education and training were the main component of the prevention and control interventions, all of them were conducted in the Mekong region, which comprises Viet Nam, Cambodia and Lao PDR. The programs were aimed at communities in rural settings, focusing on increasing awareness of HPAI,46, 60 motivating people to access healthcare earlier60 and encouraging a change in hygiene and poultry handling behavior.78, 80\n\nThe study by Bhandari et al. conducted training to 100 farmers who then served as demonstrators for a model of proper biosecurity measures for the prevention and control of HPAI.46 The authors report that no outbreaks have been reported in the communities in the project areas since the intervention. The program was evaluated in more depth using the funder's own model, the Participatory Self-Review and Planning Toolkit, but the authors do not give details of the tool kit or the evaluation process.\n\nThe studies by Manabe et al.60 and Van Kerkhove et al.78 are both before and after intervention studies in comparable cohorts, the former in two agricultural communities in Viet Nam, the latter in two southern provinces in Cambodia. Baseline and post-intervention KAP scores were calculated by Manabe; they also reported differences in the frequency of health and hygiene behaviours between the intervention and control groups.60 The authors state a greater proportion of participants reported receiving information from a health care worker or a friend after the intervention, and more people were likely to seek early access to healthcare after the intervention. Habits such as touching and eating dead or sick poultry were reported both pre- and post-intervention. Van Kerkhove et al. also describes increased reporting to village chiefs, but not to the animal health officer.78 Awareness of HPAI was high, but understanding of transmission was still low. While there were some improvements to basic hygiene practices and reduction in risky poultry handling behaviours, some risky behaviours still persisted (allowing children to play with poultry, proper treatment of poultry in the household environment).\n\nThe study by Waisbord et al. was a large undertaking, with training delivered to 3840 district and commune women's union officers in Viet Nam, 810 village promoters in Cambodia and 93 reporters and editors in Lao PDR.80 The authors provide the number of people, districts, farmers, trained, as process measures. Only in the Viet Namese study do they report pre- and post-intervention KAP scores, reporting an increase from 54% to 92%. Nine percent of farmer households in Cambodia set up model farms after participating in the study, and in Lao PDR, AI coverage on TV and radio improved in both quality and quantity.\n\nThe HPAI program in Indonesia began as separate PDS and PDR (participatory disease response) teams, but was later rolled into combined surveillance and response officers. The surveillance component of the program was successful in detecting HPAI, and the PDSR education component also achieved good coverage (29,476 education meetings held with community leaders, 10,093, 6,804, 103,832 and 9,971 meetings held with groups of community members, other organizations, individual households and persons from commercial enterprises, respectively).27, 35, 42\n\nDetails of contextual factors extracted from each included study are presented in Table 35. Some recurring themes emerged in several of the studies analysed. Several studies reported changing behaviours and customs was difficult,33, 42, 60, 78 particularly for residents of a rural area with a one-time educational intervention.60 Van Kerkhove et al. report that educational efforts that succeeded in raising awareness and knowledge about the disease did not always succeed in increasing the likelihood of reporting of suspected disease to the authorities (only to community leaders).78 Perry et al. also reported the difficulty in implementing poultry movement control in Indonesia in general, but particularly in the backyard poultry sector.42 While database recorded movement control was implemented for all HPAI confirmed cases, discussions held with farmers in field visits showed clearly that selling of surviving chickens was widely practiced. Lack of cooperation was also reported in the study by Desvaux et al. from farmers who were reluctant to have animals bled for studies.33\n\nNevertheless, they also reported other benefits and strengths of the programs, such as better collaborative networks both at a local level as well as between agencies, sometimes enhancing existing national systems already in place.42 The PDSR program in Indonesia had very positive impacts on revitalising veterinary services in Indonesia, and in particular in strengthening the local animal health services (Dinas), as well as empowering communities' access to public services. Manabe et al. acknowledged the importance of the involvement of local healthcare workers and administrators in H5N1 education and outreach, and that the main impact of the educational intervention was to increase people's trust in local health care providers.60 Waisbord et al. commented that training brought commune council people together and provided the opportunity to network and cooperate more closely in the future.80 However, it became apparent that the PDSR response alone was insufficient and unlikely to contain and eliminate the disease for a number of reasons: inability to offer compensation to encourage culling, inability by the officers to enforce movement control, inability of the farmers to buy cages and feed to restrain poultry. The program evaluators advocated the need for transition into more sustainable and responsive animal health services.42\n\nEvidence for surveillance interventions of HPAI was identified in programs in Indonesia and Cambodia. The PDSR program in Indonesia has been very successful in training surveillance officers and detecting HPAI in backyard poultry. It has also added value to existing veterinary health services in Indonesia. Conversely, results from the surveillance interventions in Cambodia were equivocal because of several constraints that impacted on the success of the study. Prevention and control initiatives were identified in Cambodia, Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Indonesia. Several programs were not evaluated in terms of final outcomes (only process outcomes were used), or if evaluated, the results have not been published. Several studies identified risky poultry behaviour despite the educational intervention and efforts by disease control staff to contain and eliminate disease for a number of reasons. The need to transition to more sustainable, long \u2013term animal health services was also discussed. Despite this, a benefit of these programs has been to strengthen local collaborative networks and bring people together.\n\nNone of the five studies included in this section of the review present any ongoing community-based human or animal surveillance interventions for rabies, and we did not find other evidence for community-based surveillance interventions. Both of the studies with successful rabies control programs required coordination and cooperation among government and provincial services. Kamoltham comments that rabies is reportable in Thailand, and this is also true of other countries in SE Asia.86 It is possible that surveillance of rabies is not suited at a community level. With the advent of cheaper and safer human vaccines and the development of more economical regimes for human post-exposure treatment (PET), most Southeast Asian countries are able to administer PET through rabies treatment centres, hospitals and clinics similar to those discussed in the paper by Kamoltham,54 and surveillance of human cases of rabies through these health provision settings would be a reasonable and feasible approach.\n\nIn recent years, the WHO has taken the initiative to develop a regional strategy for the elimination of human rabies transmitted by dogs and advocate for rabies control programs in SEA. Rabies control activities in a number of SE Asian countries are now government-driven with the involvement of government officials, health workers and community members.86\n\nThe majority of human rabies is transmitted by dogs through human-animal bite injuries. Models for rabies control programs summarised in this review were based on use of a number of control interventions, including vaccination of animals, restriction of movement of animals, removal of unrestricted animals (culling) and health education. However, the results of the studies included in this review would suggest that mass canine vaccination is the mainstay of successful canine rabies control programs. This has been shown to be the case in a number of other countries throughout the world 87. Estrada showed oral baits to be an acceptable82 and successful50 method of vaccine delivery to vaccinate dogs that was easier to administer than injection. Studies conducted in other countries support this evidence, particularly in the stray and ownerless (common) dog population.88\n\nThese interventions require high level support and coordination for their implementation.54, 68, 81 Inability to implement these strategies properly contributed to failure to control the outbreak on Flores Island.81 Legislation to enforce these interventions is also an essential component of rabies control strategies but in recent years, the WHO has also developed and standardised innovative control tools and techniques that may help support future control programs.89\n\nThe reduction in the number of deaths from rabies in the study by Kamoltham is noteworthy, and is likely a result of a combined effect of expansion of the PET regimen in humans as well as the dog vaccination campaign.54 This reduction in the number of human deaths due to the increased uptake of the PET for rabies has also been documented in other Asian countries.90 However, the number of rabies exposures are increasing in many countries, which may be explained by the finding that the use of effective dog control programs for dog rabies elimination has become rarer in developing countries.91\n\nNone of the studies evaluated the cost benefits and cost-effectiveness of rabies control interventions, particularly in comparison to the cost of patient expanded treatment (PET) regimen used in these countries. Canine vaccination has been shown to be a comparatively inexpensive and ethical way to control the disease in animals and prevent human exposure and illness in model-based studies, especially in resource-limited countries,92 more so than the use of tissue-culture vaccines used in post-exposure prophylaxis.\n\nA number of studies showed the importance of education and good information dissemination, as well as the form of campaign information, on the likelihood of owners to vaccinate their pets. This has been backed by other studies,92, 93 who have shown that 70-75% of dogs are accessible to control measures, particularly vaccination, if the approach is adapted to the dog-man relationship and the community is fully involved in the rabies elimination program.\n\nHigher level support and the involvement of the authorities was also essential in the success (or failure) of both outbreak control measures and routine canine vaccination, because some form of law enforcement was required, particularly where no one claimed ownership such as the stray dog and common dog population. Lack of coordination between local authorities made it difficult to contain the infected dog population and prolonged the outbreak.\n\nNipah virus\n\nThe Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia was initially thought to have been illness due to Japanese encephalitis (JE), a mosquito-borne illness, and early control efforts focussed on mosquito source reduction and administration of a JE vaccine.29 An epidemiological trace-back study conducted by scientists from the CDC and the AAHL with the collaboration of local veterinarians later identified Nipah virus as the causative agent. The lack of an established early warning system that incorporated some form of ongoing monitoring of herd health hampered the prompt identification and control of the outbreak, and would certainly have impacted on the magnitude of the outbreak.\n\nSwine surveillance implemented during the outbreak and after the outbreak ceased was shown to be effective in detecting infected herds. None of the studies discussed the cost of the surveillance system, or the feasibility of an ongoing system. A sustainable, ongoing and structured monitoring system for Nipah virus as well as other animal diseases would reduce the impact of any further outbreaks of zoonotic disease. We found no evaluations of surveillance initiatives post the 1999 outbreak; nor any assessment of costs or other attributes such as the functionality of these systems.\n\nThe study by Ozawa et al. presented trace back systems in several Asian countries.40 The study comments that trace back systems are not well developed and marking of animals for trace back is practised only in a limited number of countries in specific areas or zones and for specific purposes only. A comprehensive herd monitoring system would need to incorporate some form of identification system to be able to trace back and isolate an infected animal from a particular farm.\n\nAll control measures discussed in the studies were emergency measures used in response to the Malaysian Nipah virus outbreak. They included culling, movement restrictions, quarantine, PPE for farmers and all persons coming into contact with infected pigs (the military, healthcare staff), health education and practices of farm-gate biosecurity (disinfection, isolation). The sustainability and feasibility of using these interventions outside of an outbreak situation has not been discussed and it is unlikely that some of the more extreme interventions are appropriate for routine use.\n\nOur review found some evidence of proposed long-term sustainable prevention and control measures. New guidelines proposed by the Department of Veterinary Services, Malaysian Ministry of Agriculture, to restructure the industry in line with designated pig farming areas and \u201cgood animal husbandry concepts\u201d were to be implemented in each State.37 Muniandy et al. and Aziz et al. also outline recommendations for future reform in their paper, which were subsequently discussed at a regional seminar on Nipah virus infection held in Kuala Lumpur in 2001 and jointly organised by the OIE and the Department of Veterinary Services in Malaysia.26 These include policies and protocols for sound farm management practices, which would incorporate farm-gate biosecurity (i.e. quarantine of new animals brought onto the farm, exclusion testing to establish disease status) and would require the engagement of the pig farming industry. Other preventative measures include outbreak preparedness plans for the management of future disease outbreaks and laboratory diagnostic capability. It is unclear how much progress there has been in this area as our review did not find any evidence to show the implementation of any of these measures.\n\nThe outbreak came at enormous political and social cost to Malaysia. The importance of Nipah virus as a newly emerging viral disease in the SE Asian region cannot be understated. While the disease was eradicated from pigs in Malaysia, its natural history suggests there is an on-going need for preparedness for the potential of further outbreaks of Nipah virus in the region. The challenge for Malaysia and other countries in the Asian and Oceanic regions will be to implement a herd monitoring system and control strategies that are acceptable and sustainable, and the need to develop their own preparedness plans.\n\nDengue\n\nSome evidence was available evaluating surveillance activities for dengue, although we would agree with the recommendations from an earlier systematic review94 that more prospective studies are required to determine the most appropriate dengue surveillance system capable of providing early warning of epidemics. Six studies looked at dengue surveillance at a number of levels, ranging from community level to reporting to the provincial health services. From the results presented in Oum et al., it appears that a considerable proportion of people with symptoms consistent with dengue haemorrhagic fever do not access healthcare and are treated at home.39 Furthermore Chairulfatah et al. found significant underreporting to the local public health office of cases that do seek healthcare.31 These results have implications for the estimation of the burden of disease of dengue fever as well as actioning of control activities in response to hyper endemic activity.\n\nThe study by Pang et al. shows the usefulness in incorporating GP sentinel surveillance utilising \u2018point of care\u2019 testing to assess suspected cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever in a timely fashion for those cases that do access healthcare.41 However, this study was trialled with two GP clinics in an urban setting within the Kuala Lumpur area of Malaysia. It is unlikely that this approach will be applicable in a rural setting where people are less likely to go to a doctor, and confirmatory testing is costly and logistically challenging.\n\nThe two studies utilising surveillance data were useful in predicting outbreak activity and spatial clustering of outbreaks.28, 32 However, the spatial analysis has not taken into account other factors accounting for spatial clustering of outbreaks. Such approaches are also only as good as the underlying data they use. In countries such as Singapore, with well-established surveillance in place and good government support for health services, surveillance information is likely to be robust. Other developing countries in need of surveillance improvements could not use this approach.\n\nThe majority of studies reported outcomes in terms of larval or mosquito indices rather than disease outcomes. There has not been much attempt to look at the correlation between dengue vector and disease indicators. Long term absence (or low rates) of the vector does appear to translate into reduced disease incidence, however, in the short-term vector and disease outcomes do not appear to be well correlated.84 As such reliance on larval or vector indices as the primary outcome measures poses a limitation in terms of evaluating the impact of these strategies on dengue control and the burden of dengue illness in this region given that the majority of studies had follow up periods of less than two years. Short duration of follow-up also means results can be confounded by seasonal and epidemic trends in vector populations and dengue incidence.\n\nTwo studies reported the use of serology to measure rates of dengue of infection and showed that rates of dengue seropositivity were higher than rates of clinical dengue infection. This provides interesting evidence for a high incidence of subclinical infection and supports the idea that there is a silent reservoir of disease. This has large implications for the evaluation of both dengue surveillance and control activities, as evaluations based on clinical reporting will underestimate rates of dengue.\n\nThe dengue vector, Aedes aegypti responds to control via a variety of methods, and successful programs are fairly homogenous in the extent to which they are able to reduce larval indices over short time periods (less than two years). This finding concurs with the results of three earlier systematic reviews that have looked at the effectiveness of dengue vector control interventions on reducing entomological indicators.15, 95, 96 Choice between methods of vector control for a given setting may rest on factors such as feasibility, cost and sustainability, as well as contextual factors such as cultural and community acceptance (see next section), factors which have been poorly explored in the included studies.\n\nChemical options for vector control appear to be better suited to epidemic or outbreak situations. The higher cost of chemical control relative to environmental and biological vector control, plus the need for repeat dosing makes them a less sustainable option for ongoing vector control, particularly in rural areas. However evidence from Cambodia showed that a program based on twice yearly larviciding and dengue awareness activities prevented an increase in dengue incidence over five years, indicating that their use may be more relevant in urban areas where water and waste removal infrastructure is better developed. Larviciding (targeting breeding sites) has been studied more than insecticiding (where adult mosquitoes are targeted), the latter has mainly been used in outbreak scenarios indicating it is unlikely to be an option for long-term control. Trials of insecticide treated curtains indicate that this intervention is unlikely to be sustainable for a number of reasons, including poor use and maintenance of the curtains.\n\nHigh quality studies conducted in Viet Nam showed that control interventions based around biological, environmental and education components can maintain their effectiveness in reducing entomological indices to the point of local elimination of the vector and in reducing cases of dengue infection over sustained periods of time (10 years).57 Copepods (natural predators of mosquito larvae) were introduced into water containers to reduce larvae numbers. They can be locally produced, are low cost and have a higher level of acceptability as compared to Temephos\u00a9. They have been shown to be effective in both rural and urban areas. However, their use seems best suited to contexts where water is sourced predominantly from large communal water containers, and these containers represent the major breeding habitat for the mosquito. Use of copepods has always been evaluated in conjunction with environmental and waste management activities. These activities have been a core component of most dengue control interventions that have been evaluated and are highly successful if high levels of community involvement can be achieved. They are appropriate for use in both urban and rural settings, and clean-up targeted at the most productive vector breeding sites is as effective as a blanket approach at lower cost.\n\nUnfortunately there are few direct comparisons of dengue control programs. A narrative interpretation of the forest plots generated in the meta-analysis suggests that there is relative homogeneity of effectiveness across types of vector control intervention, country, and urban v. rural context. Based on a single study77 that compared environmental cleanup to a fogging intervention, the environmental cleanup intervention was more effective during the dry season at reducing larval and vector numbers, however the interventions were comparable during the wet season. This supports the suggestion that chemical interventions may be most suited to outbreak/epidemic situations44, 49. For ongoing control, targeted interventions (where specific containers, buildings or areas are identified to receive the intervention, rather than trying to achieve blanket coverage) appear to offer comparable levels of effectiveness but at a lower cost.38, 76 Targeted strategies obviously rely on having good epidemiological data to ensure that the right sites are identified.\n\nThere are few studies that have tried to replicate findings from successful programs in other contexts, and few evaluations of interventions that have been rolled out as regional or national programs. This inhibits the ability to comment on the feasibility and sustainability or even likely effectiveness of interventions outside a pilot study or research context. An earlier systematic review of the functioning of vector control operations found a number of limitations to current programs including a lack of personnel, expertise and budgets, difficulties engaging communities and almost no monitoring and evaluation.96 There is an urgent need for evidence on how findings for successful interventions can be better translated into effective practice.\n\nThe studies included in the review reported a range of contextual factors, behavioural mechanisms or intervention features that either improved or inhibited the effectiveness of the program. High levels of community engagement are necessary for dengue control interventions to be effective. Barriers to community engagement that are reported in the studies include the perception that dengue is not an important public health issue or that the proposed intervention is not effective. This highlights the importance of education and communication about both dengue and the intervention prior to roll-out in the community. It was also shown that knowledge alone did not automatically translate into improved dengue control behaviours and centrally coordinated environmental cleanup or temephos distribution activities were required to reinforce use of control methods. A barrier specific to community involvement in environmental cleanup activities is a belief that these activities are a government responsibility. Conversely, establishment of these tasks as economic activities, through use of microcredit schemes for small recycling businesses, promoted engagement with this activity. Recycling is not a new concept in Viet Nam; it is not clear whether this strategy would be successful settings where rates of recycling are currently low.\n\nFactors that promote high levels of community engagement include the use of multiple methods of communication and education, repetition of education and awareness activities (rather than one-off sessions), use of existing community groups to promote and deliver intervention activities (in particular schools), and engagement of community members at all stages of the interventions; planning, delivery and evaluation. High levels of community ownership and responsibility for ongoing control activities (in particular environmental management) also have spin off benefits for the community not related to dengue control, including greater advocacy skills and an increase in civic pride. Unfortunately none of the studies provided clear descriptions or rationale for how they selected key community groups or leaders and none provided information on the content of their education and awareness activities or any models of behaviour change on which these had been based. This limits the ability to generalise findings to other social and cultural contexts or adapt successful programs for trial in other locations. It should also be noted that the highest quality evidence was undertaken in Viet Nam which has a fairly hierarchical culture that may have facilitated dissemination of information and increased social compulsion to engage with project activities.\n\nThere was only limited evidence for the sustainability of interventions. However, in studies with more than two year follow up periods, factors that promoted sustainability included broad community involvement across different levels (rather than isolated groups), and a sense of community ownership of and pride in the control program. Where activities were embedded into the economic activity of the community (e.g. support for recycling businesses) this also improved sustainability. However, it was also noted that community based programs still need support from authorities and cannot be solely based on the efforts of volunteer individuals and community groups. We would also add that it is unclear the extent to which being part of a research project with access to a highly skilled, motivated and engaged research team contributes to levels of effectiveness.\n\nKay et al.57 reported a lower level of effectiveness for their intervention when it was rolled out as part of a regional program. This has implications for the use of any of these methods of dengue control as part of a larger program. It is well recognised that adequate resourcing for both start up and maintenance of interventions is important to ensure that the program functions well and communities maintain engagement as without this effectiveness is compromised.94 Although some interventions are low cost per person covered, the total cost may still be large. It would be worth exploring mechanisms to offset these costs as was done in the Viet Namese studies where some of the profits from recycling businesses were put back into community dengue awareness activities.\n\nWe found little evidence of evaluations of ongoing laboratory, animal or human surveillance systems set up in many countries in response to the SARS outbreak in 2003, nor any assessments of regional surveillance networks or linkages between countries in the Southeast Asian region, given the geographical restrictions placed on the scope of this review.\n\nThe single study by Escudero et al. of work-place surveillance within a hospital in Singapore was tested within a very structured work context, within which there was access to electronic staff leave records.34 It is unclear whether this system would work in a more loosely structured work environment. The absence of electronic systems would also increase the labour resources required for such a system. The lack of specificity and the possibility of \u201cfalse outbreaks\u201d which could eventually lead to fatigue amongst the staff and agencies involved in responding to potential outbreak situations limit its applicability as an ongoing surveillance system in its current form.\n\nThe study reporting on use of temperature screening amongst school children during the epidemic describe the benefits of this type of surveillance as psychological.73 A similar argument has been made for the use of temperature screening at airports97 which was also costly and had a very low yield in terms of detecting SARS cases. Whilst it is important to avoid negative reactions and panic amongst the community during outbreaks, these screening systems are an expensive (and ongoing) investment and it is unclear if they could be implemented in more resource constrained settings.\n\nThree of the four studies51, 63, 73 included in this section of the review focused on contact tracing and quarantine protocols. While the fourth study75 looked at the effectiveness of personal protective equipment to prevent infection, the quality of the study was poor and the results of the study were of limited value. We did not find other studies reviewing other prevention and control measures (for example, handwashing, temperature screening, closure of workplaces and schools, education campaigns).\n\nThe three studies from Singapore all used the same outbreak dataset, and reach similar conclusions that the system was effective in ensuring progressively earlier isolation of probable SARS cases as the outbreak progressed. They also saw a reduction in the number of secondary infections over time. As SARS cases are only infectious whilst symptomatic, and they become more infectious over time, it is logical that this strategy would have been successful in helping to contain the outbreak in Singapore. Indeed the outbreak was brought under control. However, a range of other community-focused strategies were also put in place, including entry and exit screening at airports, market closures, temperature screening in school children and a variety of media health education campaigns, alongside the host of strategies put in place within healthcare facilities. Because of this, the studies are unable to estimate the independent effect of this particular intervention in stopping the outbreak, and no attempt has been made to analyse the size of the effect of confounding and interaction on the authors' results. Furthermore, although the system was sensitive (a quarter of all SARS cases had been on quarantine orders prior to diagnosis) it was not specific (only 0.5% of those isolated went on to develop SARS) making it highly resource intensive per SARS case detected.\n\nResults from the study by Tuan are of limited value. As 95% of the contacts reported never using a mask, the study is underpowered to detect any beneficial impact from using this intervention. As such no conclusions about the effectiveness of this intervention can be drawn. Earlier systematic reviews of the use of masks and other personal protective equipment to prevent transmission of infectious agents have also been unable to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of this approach to control.98\n\nWe are limited in the ability to generalise the findings about these interventions to detect and/or prevent spread of SARS because four of the five studies that were included were from Singapore, considered an \u201ceconomically advanced country\u201d with high GDP and level of education, and other particular features such as an urban setting and a small population. It has strong government and political leadership and good levels of community support. A significant proportion of its public are proficient with information technology. The challenges with implementing surveillance of SARS (and other respiratory diseases) in other Southeast Asian countries with less capable national agencies and healthcare institutions will be to engage with community-level healthcare workers and clinics to implement some form of symptomatic or sentinel non-confirmatory surveillance system.\n\nThe success of quarantine and home isolation measures in Singapore was in part due to the capability of the Singaporean government to commit significant financial resources to enforce this policy with random phone checking, electronic camera surveillance, nurse visits and financial incentives. It is unlikely these strategies would work in a resource-challenged country, either due to a lack of financial commitment from the government, the lack of technology (telephones, cameras), or a less well developed infrastructure. This is likely to be particularly true for rural and remote areas. There are also particular social and cultural features of Singaporean society that may have contributed to the high levels of acceptability and compliance with quarantine and isolation measures. Finally, tolerance for this approach outside a high profile outbreak scenario is likely to be low.\n\nAvian Influenza\n\nThe PDSR program in Indonesia has been very successful in detecting HPAI in backyard poultry and allowed a clear and accurate picture of the disease status of HPAI in this sector.42 It has also added value to existing veterinary health services in Indonesia and proved to be a good investment, not just for AI, but also for other animal diseases. Perry et al.'s evaluation found a disproportionate focus on the backyard poultry sector 4, as farmers have considerable interaction with small-scale commercial farms (sector 3). For this reason, surveillance efforts need to cast a broader net and greater engagement of the commercial poultry sector is required. It is unfortunate that the study in Cambodia by Desvaux et al. had several methodological limitations, as it has been the only one to present information on surveillance of commercial poultry and duck farms.33 Both studies were able to classify villages according to their risk of either having faced an HPAI outbreak33 or the probability of HPAI infection,42 allowing prioritisation of control activities. Perry's report also showed that the majority of visits were scheduled or \u2018active\u2019 surveillance (87%) as opposed to passive surveillance (13%), but were more effective in detecting disease.42 Surveillance also identified sources of infection (traders, unsafe disposal of carcasses and contaminated vehicles).\n\nThe intensive surveillance program in Indonesia required considerable financial investment from external donors and it is unlikely that resource-challenged countries such as Cambodia and Lao PDR would be able to roll out a similarly extensive program. Surveillance programs would have to be setting-specific and tailored to the needs and funds available of the host country. A further challenge for surveillance of HPAI is to transition the achievements gained in the program into a sustainable national system that continues to be accepted. Other than the studies presented in Cambodia and Indonesia, no evidence was found for animal or human surveillance at a community level in the other countries included in this review.\n\nThe study by Samaan et al. indicated that rumour surveillance based on internet sources is timely and low cost but although it's sensitivity has been demonstrated it is not clear whether the system is specific enough to be of use.43 Detection of too many \u201cfalse\u201d outbreaks will limit the credibility of the system. Nevertheless, pilot studies of low cost systems such as this are an important avenue of research to try and extend surveillance coverage to areas with lower levels of information technology, laboratory and healthcare infrastructure.\n\nEvidence for prevention and control interventions were reported in programs in Cambodia, Viet Nam, Lao PDR and Indonesia. Awareness of HPAI and education regarding risky poultry handling behaviours were common themes in the educational interventions. While the training and education seems to have been well-received, it did not always translate into behaviour modification or change. As some programs were not evaluated, it is difficult to say which components of the intervention have failed and why. An internet rumour based surveillance system represents a potential low cost and timely form of surveillance to inform immediate public health action, but may be limited in its applicability, across the region as it depends highly on the level of engagement of local public health professionals with the chat forums and mailing lists searched, and journalists awareness of AI and quality of reporting. It needs to be demonstrated whether it is capable of detecting outbreaks in resource limited areas where citizens may not have access to the technology on which the system relies.\n\nThe prevention and control interventions in the PDSR program in Indonesia had limited success in controlling and eliminating HPAI, for a variety of reasons. Veterinary officers have no legal mandate to enforce culling or movement restrictions of dead or infected poultry. Furthermore, in the absence of financial compensation for loss of livelihood, farmers are under no obligation to report mortality or sickness in animals and will not comply with the requests of disease control officers, and therefore interventions need to be setting-specific. This comes back to the theme of \u201cparticipatory epidemiology\u201d \u2013 engagement of the farmer in decision\u2013making through education and training, but the corollary, that is, recognition of the needs of the community are also essential.\n\nThe studies stressed the importance of engaging local people and civil societies, who can provide rich institutional resources to support difficult changes in health and animal husbandry practices. It was also recognised that local people have rich and detailed knowledge about the animals they keep and the diseases that affect them (termed \u201cexisting veterinary knowledge\u201d), whilst researchers often do not know or understand the local context. In SE Asian countries, the poultry industry involves an enormous and diverse set of small entrepreneurs, linked in a number of business relationships and with a wide range of players. Effective HPAI control will require engagement at all levels of the industry. Issues such as financial compensation (or the lack of) for control activities will have to be addressed before governments can enforce policies around culling, movement restrictions and quarantining.\n\nEvidence evaluating both veterinary and public health surveillance systems for rabies was not identified; this lack of evidence may in fact reflect the fact that there are no or poorly functioning systems in place. Canine vaccination appears to be the most promising strategy for control, but investment in education is essential for a successful vaccination campaign. Rabies control was more likely to be successful when canine vaccination was used in conjunction with other control strategies. However, canine control activities (including vaccination, sterilisation and culling) are not always popular with the public, and country-specific cultural attitudes can be important. Treatment programs for exposed cases continue to be expanded which has helped to reduce mortality rates, but not rates of exposure to rabies.\n\nWhile the concepts of farm-gate biosecurity and herd health monitoring were discussed at the OIE/DVS meeting, there has not been any further progress on recommendations set out at the meeting or any recent publications discussing progress in this area. All evidence on control activities has been in response to the outbreak. Data from targeted and ongoing surveillance as well as the cost and feasibility of the interventions will be essential to guide future prevention and control efforts outside of an outbreak setting, both of which have been absent from the literature. Local traditional farming practices will have to be considered when drafting policies and protocols for sound farm management practices.\n\nThe dengue vector is amenable to short term control via a variety of vector control methods. Currently there are not enough studies of the same intervention type, nor many direct comparisons of interventions to be able to assess whether one form of intervention is more successful than another at reducing larval indices.\n\nWhere vector control is sustained, this appears to result in a reduction in dengue cases. However, many of the existing studies evaluating dengue control interventions do not have a long enough follow-up period to enable an assessment of the sustainability. Environmental management to reduce larval habitats is an effective way at reducing vector numbers and can be used in both urban and rural areas. It is often supplemented with the use of either biological (such as copepods) or chemical (such as Temephos\u00a9) larvicidal agents. The latter is reported as being less acceptable due to problems with smell and taste. The former has good evidence for sustainability and is low cost, but the suitability of this control method in settings where water is not obtained from large centralised tanks has not been evaluated. Disease education is important but in the absence of other coordinated activities does not result in improved control practices.\n\nThere is limited evidence for the use of interventions outside research projects. Studies that have evaluated roll out of interventions to regional programs indicate that effectiveness may be reduced, possibly due a lower level of access to technical expertise and lack of involvement of communities in the program planning stages. Sustainability requires communities to take ownership of ongoing control activities. High levels of community engagement require multiple methods of communication and activities.\n\nThere appear to be large investments in several countries in SE Asia on training, educational and surveillance initiatives, but evidence on the evaluation of these programs was not always identified. Surveillance in the backyard poultry sector has been successful in identifying HPAI in backyard poultry flocks, but needs to be broadened to include other sectors of the commercial poultry industry. Surveillance interventions have had added spin-off benefits of strengthening the local animal health services. Prevention and control efforts have proved more challenging for a number of reasons. Successful educational campaigns have not always translated into behavior modification and change. Involvement of and recognition of the needs of the community are essential in addressing these barriers to change. Community programs have been largely reliant on external funding, and the challenge will be to incorporate them into the national process where the programs can become institutionalised in a sustainable way."}
