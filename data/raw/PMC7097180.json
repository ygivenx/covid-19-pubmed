{"title": "Oncolytic viruses: a new class of immunotherapy drugs", "body": "Oncolytic virus immunotherapy is a therapeutic approach to cancer treatment that utilizes native or genetically modified viruses that selectively replicate within tumour cells. The ability of viruses to kill cancer cells has been recognized for nearly a century, but only over the past decade have clinical trials documented a therapeutic benefit in patients with cancer1,2,3. Interest in oncolytic viruses has been increasing, based on a better understanding of viral biology, tumour immunology and molecular genetics. Furthermore, a recent randomized Phase III clinical trial demonstrated an improved durable response rate for patients with advanced melanoma who were treated with a modified herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), encoding granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)3. This virus, termed talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC; Amgen), is widely anticipated to be the first oncolytic virus immunotherapy to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cancer. The success of T-VEC is likely to promote further drug development within this new class of cancer therapeutics.\n\nOf the nearly 1 million vertebrate viruses, approximately 320,000 are thought to infect mammalian cells4. Viruses have several shared properties; these include a genetic element composed of single- or double-stranded DNA or RNA and the ability to infect host cells and replicate under permissive conditions (Tables 1,2).\n\nThe outcome of viral infections can be highly variable depending on the pathogenic nature of the virally encoded genes, interactions between the virus and the host immune system and the ability of the virus to replicate and/or induce latency following infection. Insights into the mechanisms of viral entry, replication, induction and/or suppression of immune responses and lytic versus latent infections have led to an intense interest in utilizing viruses for the treatment of human diseases and have been used to select oncolytic vectors for the treatment of specific types of cancers. In contrast to standard viral-based 'vaccines', oncolytic viruses directly infect and lyse tumour cells in situ. They do not necessarily require defined antigens to be included in the vector as tumour-associated antigens may be released by dying tumour cells. Oncolytic viruses can also provide additional danger signals that can promote an efficient antitumour immune response.\n\nAlthough incompletely understood, oncolytic viruses are thought to mediate antitumour activity through two distinct mechanisms of action: selective replication within neoplastic cells, resulting in a direct lytic effect on tumour cells; and induction of systemic antitumour immunity. The relative contribution of these mechanisms may differ depending on the nature and type of cancer cell, the characteristics of the viral vector, and the interaction between the virus, tumour microenvironment and host immune system.\n\nCertain viruses have the ability to enter cancer cells and selectively replicate within such cells. Although oncolytic viruses can enter both normal and cancer cells, the inherent abnormalities in the cancer cell response to stress, cell signalling and homeostasis provide a selective advantage for viral replication5. The normal host cell antiviral machinery, which is responsible for the detection and clearance of viruses, may also be abnormal in cancer cells. For example, the protein kinase R (PKR) is a critical factor that helps in clearing intracellular viral infections. PKR may be absent in some cancer cells, allowing increased viral replication, whereas it may be active in other cancer cells, such as low-grade tumours, and these differences can influence the therapeutic activity of an oncolytic virus.\n\nThe immune response to oncolytic viruses appears to be an important component of the antitumour effect, but it can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, viruses can help to promote an immune response against the tumour cells by allowing tumour antigen presentation in the context of an active viral infection. On the other hand, neutralizing antiviral responses may block virus replication and ongoing infection of tumour cells. The therapeutic outcome depends on a complex interplay between these opposing forces. When systemic immunity is fully engaged, however, therapeutic responses may be seen in both locally injected tumours and at distant sites of un-infected tumour growth.\n\nMany viruses have been proposed as vectors for oncolytic virus immunotherapy, and considerable work has been done to optimize viral vectors by attenuating pathogenicity and enhancing immunogenicity6. To date, adenoviruses, poxviruses, HSV-1, coxsackieviruses, poliovirus, measles virus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), reovirus, and others, have entered into early-phase clinical trials. Two viruses, T-VEC and H101 (Shanghai Sunway Biotech) have now achieved regulatory review. H101 is a genetically modified oncolytic adenovirus that, in combination with chemotherapy, was approved for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in China in November 2005 (Refs 3,7).\n\nThis Review provides a comprehensive overview of critical issues in the development of oncolytic virus immunotherapy. We discuss preclinical and clinical data that support a role for oncolytic viruses in cancer therapy and detail some of the unique challenges in oncolytic viruse drug development.\n\nAs oncolytic viruses are live viral particles, the overall design of oncolytic virus strategies must consider approaches to tumour cell targeting and attenuating viral pathogenesis, as well as approaches to limit viral immunogenicity while promoting tumour cell killing and immunogenicity. The flexibility of recombinant engineering has allowed the exploration of a number of strategies to enhance the effectiveness of oncolytic viruses.\n\nTargeting oncolytic viruses to cancer cells. Many of the oncolytic viruses that are currently in the clinic have a natural tropism for cell surface proteins that are aberrantly expressed by cancer cells (Fig. 3). For example, HSV-1 uses the herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) and selected nectins for cell entry. These surface receptors are overexpressed on some cancer cells, including melanoma and various carcinomas40. Measles virus, specifically the Edmonston strain, utilizes the surface receptor CD46 for cell entry41. CD46 normally functions to prevent cell elimination by inactivating the complement pathway of the immune system, and is often overexpressed by cancer cells42. Coxsackievirus can enter cells via intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1; also known as CD54) and decay accelerating factor (DAF; also known as CD55), which can be overexpressed in cancers such as multiple myeloma, melanoma, and breast cancer (although coxsackieviruses may also use nectins for cell entry)43,44,45. Echovirus, a member of the enterovirus family, has increased specificity for ovarian cancer cells because it uses the I domain of integrin \u03b12\u03b21 for cell entry, which can be overexpressed on these cells46. Another member of the enterovirus family, poliovirus, has enhanced specificity for various cancers through its targeting of CD155, a receptor that can potentially impair antitumour NK cell responses and is overexpressed by some cancer cells26. Sindbis virus, a member of the Togaviridae family, targets cancer cells that overexpress the 67 kDa laminin receptor, which promotes cancer cell invasion and motility47.\n\nOncolytic viruses can also be engineered to directly target unique cell surface receptors expressed by cancer cells. Examples include the adenovirus Ad5/3-\u039424, which was modified to bind to integrins that are highly expressed on ovarian cancer cells, and is currently being investigated in clinical trials48,49. Other examples of engineered specificities include lentiviruses pseudotyped with the modified E2 glycoprotein from Sindbis virus, which was shown to increase specificity for human melanoma in a mouse xenograft model50. Furthermore, measles virus has been engineered to express a single-chain antibody that recognizes carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a tumour antigen that is selectively expressed on certain adenocarcinomas51.\n\nExploiting aberrant signalling pathways in cancer. A number of molecular targets promote virus accumulation and replication within tumour cells. For example, tumour cells frequently overexpress the B cell lymphoma (BCL) family of cell survival proteins, which is a hallmark of neoplastic transformation. NDV targets cancer cells overexpressing BCL-XL, because the overexpression of this protein prevents apoptosis and thus permits the incubation time needed by the virus to multiply and form syncytia required for viral spread52.\n\nIn addition to the BCL family, the RAS signalling pathway regulates many aspects of carcinogenesis, including resistance to cell death and proliferation53,54,55,56 (Fig. 4). Reovirus and vaccinia virus show natural selectivity for cancer cells with an over-active RAS signalling pathway. In normal healthy cells, reovirus is able to enter the cell and begin producing viral RNAs, which activates the PKR pathway. Activated PKR, in turn, inhibits protein translation, preventing the production of viral particles and stopping the spread of the virus57. However, RAS-transformed cancer cells do not initiate the PKR pathway, rendering cancer cells permissive to viral infection and ultimately cell lysis53. An attenuated HSV-1 oncolytic virus, in which the viral genes encoding ICP34.5 and unique short 11 glycoprotein (US11) are deleted, results in preferential lysis of tumour cells compared to normal cells74,79. This occurs, in part, because these deletions render HSV-1 unable to block PKR phosphorylation, so it can only replicate in cells with defective PKR signalling87. Vaccinia virus, a member of the poxvirus family, depends on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-induced RAS signalling for viral replication54. Poxviruses encode ligands that trigger EGFR signalling, and so cancer cells that overexpress EGFR (and therefore have augmented RAS signalling) are more permissive to vaccinia virus infection54.\n\nCancer cells often have defects in the antiviral mechanism based on type I IFN signalling, providing some viruses with a replicative advantage in cancer cells. These include vaccinia virus54, NDV58, rabbit myxoma virus59, mumps60, alphaviruses60, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) variants61.\n\nType I IFNs are critical for antiviral and antitumour responses in healthy cells not only because they promote immune responses to clear the virus, but also because they reduce cellular proliferation and activate the pro-apoptotic protein p53 (Ref. 62). Multiple types of cancer inactivate this pathway, either by reducing the expression of type I IFNs or by limiting type I IFN signalling via reduced receptor expression or altered downstream signalling (Figs 1,2). Thus, oncolytic viruses have increased specificity for cancer cells and environments in which the type I IFN responses are limited, because in healthy cells viruses are cleared by IFN-mediated responses.\n\nOncolytic viruses can also be engineered to take advantage of the abnormal signalling pathways in cancer cells by inserting promoters that are more active in cancer cells or that are tissue-restricted. For example, an adenovirus (CV706), in which E1A (an adenoviral protein that inhibits the cell cycle) was placed under the control of the promoter for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is currently being evaluated in patients with prostate cancer63. This virus does not produce E1A in healthy cells and these cells undergo apoptosis, thereby restricting viral proliferation in healthy tissue. However, in prostate cancer cells the PSA promoter is highly active and E1A is selectively expressed, resulting in proliferation of the adenovirus and virus-mediated cell lysis. In a similar manner, the oncolytic adenovirus KH901 was engineered to express E1A under the control of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter, which is activated in a large number of cancers64. Furthermore, two binding sites of the transcription factor E2F1 (a regulator of the cell cycle) were included in the TERT promoter to restrict proliferation to actively dividing cells. Another example is the oncolytic adenovirus CG0070, for which replication is restricted to retinoblastoma (Rb)-defective cells (a common mutation in cancer) because E1A expression was placed under the regulation of the E2F1 promoter65. In healthy cells, Rb inhibits E2F, thus inhibiting E1A transcription66. Furthermore, adenoviruses have been engineered to selectively replicate in hypoxic environments, such as those found inside tumours, by placing the E1A gene under transcriptional regulation by the hypoxia-induced transcription factor HIF-1\u03b1; this strategy was shown to be effective in a murine xenograft model of glioma67. Several oncolytic adenoviruses, including ONYX-015 and H101, have been designed with a deletion in the gene coding for the protein E1B, which can bind to and inactivate the pro-apoptotic protein p53 (Refs 85,86). Thus, healthy cells that are infected with these viruses can undergo p53 - mediated abortive apoptosis, whereas cancer cells that commonly inactivate p53 remain susceptible to viral infection. Furthermore, these adenoviruses preferentially proliferate in and lyse p53-deficient cancer cells, which account for nearly 50% of all cancers.\n\nAnother approach to improve post-entry tumour specificity has been to encode synthetic miRNA targeting sequences (miRTS) into the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the fusion gene of the measles virus. These sequences bind cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) and repress viral replication. Because normal and cancer cells exhibit differential expression of cognate miRNA elements, the engineered oncolytic virus with miRTS can be blocked from replicating in normal cells where specific miRNAs are expressed. Such a construct was designed for use in glioma, where it was shown to limit viral replication in neurons that constitutively express high levels of miR-7 while allowing proliferation in glioma cells that frequently downregulate miR-7 (Ref. 68).\n\nAttenuating viral pathogenesis. Oncolytic viruses are live viruses that can potentially cause acute toxicity and, in some cases, latent infection and chronic disease. Although the oncolytic activity may be most profound with native viruses, the potential for viral pathogenesis may also be high, resulting in a limited benefit\u2013risk ratio. The potential pathogenicity is highly dependent on the virus, the presence of natural or engineered attenuation factors (for example, virulence, and immune-evasive and latency-promoting genes) and the host immune response. To date, few serious adverse events have been reported in clinical trials but follow-up of patients is often short or incomplete. Most clinically relevant oncolytic viruses utilize attenuated vectors or naturally occurring less virulent variants of particular viruses to prevent acute and long-term toxicity. Examples of the latter are NDV-PV701, a variant of the avian virus NDV, which has been tested in clinical trials against GBM69 (see Supplementary information S1 (table)) and the Edmonston strain of measles virus (commonly used for prophylactic measles vaccination), which was selected for clinical trials in patients with GBM (Table 3).\n\nAn example of an engineered attenuated oncolytic virus is the HSV-1-based T-VEC. HSV-1 is known to cause neurovirulence and latent infection. Toxicity is mediated by the viral gene product ICP34.5, which counteracts the type I IFN response and antagonizes the PKR signalling pathway within non-dividing cells56,70,71,72,73. ICP34.5 is deleted in T-VEC, which means that it should not be able to grow within neurons or mediate latent infection. To date, there have not been any reports of latent infection with T-VEC or other attenuated HSV-1 vectors74.\n\nVaccinia virus has also been attenuated to limit its lytic activity to cancer cells. In non-attenuated vaccinia virus infections, a viral protein termed vaccinia growth factor (VGF) is secreted and acts on the host EGFR to activate the RAS signalling pathway. Such activation promotes cellular proliferation, leading to increased production of thymidine kinase (TK), which helps to promote viral replication. However, attenuation of vaccinia virus through the deletion of VGF makes replication in normal cells difficult and allows viral proliferation only in cells with aberrant EGFR\u2013RAS signalling, as frequently found in cancer cells64,75. Another component that is necessary for the infection of healthy cells is the vaccinia protein B18R, which blocks type I IFN signalling76,77. By attenuating vaccinia virus through the deletion of B18R, healthy cells become susceptible to the type I IFN antiviral response and the infection is limited. However, cancer cells commonly disrupt the type I IFN pathway to evade the immune system, and thus they are susceptible to infection and subsequent lysis. Furthermore, deletion of B18R may increase the activity of oncolytic vaccinia virus because type I IFNs produced as a result of vaccinia infection of the tumour are not blocked by B18R78.\n\nIn contrast to deleting pathogenic viral genes, the expression of virulence genes can also be restricted to tumour tissues by incorporating promoters that regulate the expression of virulence genes. As described above, adenoviruses have been engineered with E1A and E1B expression limited to tumour cells through transcriptional regulation by tumour-specific promoters. Although reversion to a native virus through natural homologous recombination remains a theoretical concern, there is no evidence that this happens in the clinic.\n\nAugmenting anti-tumour immunity. The process of tumour clearance by immune stimulation is critical to the anti-tumour activity of oncolytic viruses, and several strategies have been devised to engineer oncolytic viruses so they can more effectively stimulate anti-tumour immune responses. For example, anti-tumour immune responses can be augmented by viral expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or T cell co-stimulatory molecules. This strategy has been well described for viruses such as HSV-1, adenovirus, and vaccinia virus. Studies of HSV-1 in mice demonstrated rejection of contralateral, un-injected flank tumours only when GM-CSF, a cytokine that promotes dendritic cell accumulation and maturation, was engineered into the viral genome74,79. GM-CSF is thought to improve tumour antigen presentation and stimulate robust T cell responses. GM-CSF has been included in T-VEC80, the adenoviruses CG0070 and CGTG-102 (Ref. 81), and the vaccinia virus JX-594 (Ref. 82).\n\nAn adenovirus that expresses the heat shock protein HSP70 in cancer cells, which increases chaperoning of proteins to proteases that enhance protein degradation and processing, has been used to increase tumour antigen presentation83. This approach may also have a role in epitope spreading as APCs preferentially take up peptides bound to HSP70.\n\nFor HSV-1-based oncolytic viruses such as T-VEC, strategies have also been devised to enhance immune responses by deleting the HSV-1 protein ICP47. ICP47 blocks the function of TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) and thus prevents infected cells from presenting antigen to CD8+ T cells84.\n\nSome cancers, such as glioblastoma, are inherently resistant to apoptosis, even when infected with viruses, owing to dysregulation of apoptotic pathways. An oncolytic parvovirus H-1PV, however, was shown to kill glioma cells by activating the immunogenic cathepsin-mediated death pathway88. Furthermore, parvovirus can also induce an immune response against GBM, potentially through a bystander effect involving an increase in inflammatory cytokines (such as IFN\u03b3) and tumour antigen release89,90.\n\nEnhancing lytic activity. The inclusion of 'suicide genes' (genes that render cells more sensitive to apoptosis or therapy with other drugs) into oncolytic viruses can enhance their ability to directly kill cancer cells93,94,95. For example, the pro-apoptotic molecules TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or TNF\u03b1 have been included in viral constructs to enhance cell death and trigger an immune response91,92.\n\nUsing tumour-enriched/tissue-specific promoters to preferentially express suicide genes in cancer cells has had success in limiting side effects and improving the therapeutic effectiveness of oncolytic viruses in several preclinical models. For example, the adenovirus Ad-OC-HSV-TK, which is in development for the treatment of bone tumours, encodes the gene for HSV-1 TK driven by the osteocalcin promoter96. HSV-1 TK converts thymidine analogues (such as ganciclovir) into monophosphates, which get incorporated into the DNA of replicating cells, resulting in the termination of DNA synthesis and, ultimately, cell death97. In this system, the expression of TK is restricted to cells with an active osteocalcin promoter, and this increases their susceptibility to treatment with the thymidine analogue ganciclovir. However, as ganciclovir can block viral replication, this approach may inhibit oncolytic virus activity98,99.\n\nTwo other suicide genes that have been tested are bacterial cytosine deaminase (CD) and adenovirus death protein (ADP)100,101. CD can transform 5-fluorocytosine into 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which is cytotoxic. ADP is a nuclear membrane glycoprotein that is required in the late stages of adenovirus infection for efficient cell lysis and release of viral particles. Enhanced lytic activity was reported for an oncolytic adenovirus that had the adp gene inserted into the adenoviral E3 locus, resulting in ADP overexpression101.\n\nLimiting antiviral immune responses. Although immune stimulation is critical to the anti-tumour activity of oncolytic viruses, this effect is balanced by the potentially rapid clearance of the virus by antiviral immunity. Moreover, humans are naturally (or artificially through vaccination) exposed to oncolytic viruses and may therefore have pre-existing neutralizing antibodies or cellular immunity against some oncolytic viruses.\n\nOne strategy to limit virus neutralization is to utilize alternative virus serotypes. Multiple serotypes exist for both adenoviruses and VSV, which allows for serotype switching between injections to prevent antibody neutralization. Although measles virus does not naturally switch serotypes, measles viruses that are engineered to mimic serotype switching have been shown to limit neutralizing antibody titres against the virus102. Other strategies to overcome viral clearance include PEGylation (covalent conjugation with polyethylene glycol) of the viral coat (VSV and adenovirus) and polymer coating (adenovirus) to prevent antibody binding and neutralization103,104,105. Polymer coating of adenovirus reduces targeting by covering viral proteins required for cell entry, but simultaneously increases circulation time. Investigators have also been able to protect oncolytic viruses from antibodies by using cell carriers (such as mesenchymal stem cells) are infected ex vivo and then transferred back into a host for trafficking to tumour sites106,107.\n\nHSV-1-specific T cell responses may be dampened through the expression of the viral US11 gene product, which blocks antigen presentation, thereby limiting detection by T cells and prolonging viral infection108.\n\nIn addition to modifying the virus, attempts have been made to suppress the host immune system \u2014 for example, through pretreatment with cyclophosphamide. This strategy was shown to enhance oncolytic efficacy of HSV- in a glioma model109.\n\nEnhancing virus bioavailability. In addition to strategies that avoid viral neutralization, as described above, a number of preclinical studies have investigated other methods for enhancing oncolytic virus bioavailability. For example, treatment with oncolytic viruses has been combined with vasoactive or vaso-normalizing treatments such as histamine110, nitroglycerin110, local hyperthermia111, low-dose paclitaxel112, bevacizumab113, and bradikynin16 to improve viral delivery.\n\nViral penetrance can also be enhanced by pretreatment of the tumour microenvironment with proteolytic enzymes (that is, hyaluronidase or collagenase) that can break down the sieve-like barrier posed by the extracellular matrix (ECM)114,115. Oncolytic viruses have also been engineered to express ECM-degrading enzymes such as hyaluronidase, which was shown to increase tumour dissemination and therapeutic activity in a melanoma xenograft model116.\n\nFurthermore, oncolytic viruses are being selected and/or engineered to overcome the physical barriers of the interstitial pressure and the acidic and hypoxic environment present in tumours by spreading between cancer cells following the induction of cell fusion. This process protects the virus from the physical limitations associated with the need for extracellular propagation and limiting the infection to the intracellular space. For example, NDV, coronavirus, orthomyxovirus and paramyxovirus use fusogenic membrane glycoproteins (FMGs) to propagate viral infection between cells. Furthermore, VSV has been engineered to express the NDV fusogenic mutant F glycoprotein117 and Sindbis virus has been engineered to express the hyperfusogenic envelope glycoprotein of gibbon ape leukaemia virus to convey fusogenic-based viral propagation118. Measles virus has been engineered to activate fusogenic membrane glycoprotein F in the context of high levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), as present in tumours, rather than through its normal regulation by furin119.\n\nUnique challenges to the development of oncolytic viruses as a new class of anticancer drugs include the need for more practical clinical trial designs and end point response assessment criteria, validated pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic (PK/PD) assays, biosafety issues and non-traditional regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization issues.\n\nPharmacodynamic considerations. Oncolytic viruses differ from standard drugs in several unique ways. They are live viruses and proliferate upon clinical administration; this can result in variable effective doses. At present, little data are available on correlating viral dose with in vivo replicative potential and therapeutic response. Further investigations relating to viral replication and clinical response in relevant preclinical models and in clinical trials will be important for establishing safe and effective dosing guidelines.\n\nOncolytic viruses are not removed as a result of cell metabolism or binding to circulating proteins; rather, they are subject to host antiviral immune responses. Multiple factors need to be considered in this regard, including pre-existing neutralizing antibody titres, virus-specific memory T cell responses, the potential for disabling some viruses by haemagglutinin binding and the innate ability of some virus to evade immune detection. In addition, many tumour microenvironments are highly immune-suppressive, which can limit the host immune response. Further studies to evaluate both pre-existing antiviral immunity and the induction of post-treatment immune responses against the viral vector and tumour-associated antigens will be important to better understand the dynamics of how oncolytic viruses are cleared and controlled in patients with cancer.\n\nBiosafety considerations. Oncolytic viruses have thus far been associated with a relatively tolerable safety profile in numerous clinical trials conducted across a wide range of cancers. Nonetheless, the replicative potential of these agents requires attention to infection control issues, including procedures for the safe storage, preparation, handling and administration of the virus. The true potential for infection depends on the nature of the virus and co-morbid conditions within patients, close household contacts and health-care workers who may be exposed to the virus. In addition, many oncolytic viruses contain recombinant DNA elements, and so the potential impact of such gene segments and the potential for their recombination with wild-type viruses in the environment are theoretical concerns.\n\nAlthough there are no universally accepted standards with respect to the biosafety of oncolytic viruses, the developmental plan should include policies for the safe handling and storage of the agent. Guidelines for health-care workers, especially pharmacists who prepare the agent and physicians or nurses who administer the agent, should be established. Most agents can be safely managed with standard universal precautions but additional educational materials need to be developed. For each virus, there should be clear instructions for how to deal with accidental spills, cleaning treatment rooms in between patient visits and instructions on possible antidotes in the event of an accidental exposure. In some cases, warnings should be issued for patients and health-care workers to avoid contact with the agent. For example, immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women should not be exposed to vaccinia virus. Plans for the management of the virus administration site should also be clearly delineated for patients and health-care workers. In the event of possible contamination of bandages and dressings, a plan for proper disposal in health-care settings and at home should be developed.\n\nAs oncolytic viruses are new agents with potential for dissemination, many plans may need to consider expanded surveillance programmes. At present it is not clear how regulatory agencies will manage the biosafety issues, but consideration of post-marketing risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) processes may be indicated. Despite the theoretical concerns, it should be noted that there have been no reports of household transmission of oncolytic viruses in the literature to date. It is also important to note that many oncolytic viruses are attenuated and the native strains are often ubiquitous in the environment. There have, however, been isolated cases of exposure of health-care professionals while handling oncolytic viruses in the laboratory or before patient administration. These cases have generally been few and without significant sequelae, although some individuals have required treatment with antiviral agents.\n\nClinical trial design and response assessment. Recent evidence has suggested that the kinetics of immune-mediated responses may be much slower when compared to therapeutic agents that directly kill tumour cells. Activation of the immune system results in an indirect method of tumour cell killing, which requires the priming and expansion of immune effector cells, most notably CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, and time for such cells to undergo homeostatic expansion, trafficking to sites of tumour growth, lytic destruction of cancer cells and inflammatory clearance of the necrotic tumour (Fig. 2). This may result in what has been termed 'pseudo-progression' and clinical trials must consider non-traditional end points that can account for the emergence of delayed therapeutic responses163. Pseudo-progression may complicate the interpretation of clinical results and should be considered in future oncolytic virus trials.\n\nIn addition, oncolytic viruses represent a challenge with respect to subject eligibility, dosing and biodistribution assessment when designing clinical trials. As many clinical studies have utilized local delivery of the virus to patients, tumours must be accessible for injection. To date, virus dosing has typically been based on the maximum concentration of virus possible, with current purification techniques and the volume of tumour as determined before each virus administration. This can be quite cumbersome and few studies have adequately explored the association between virus dose, therapeutic response and occurrences of adverse events142,164,165. Nonetheless, because oncolytic viruses can replicate within tumour tissues, even small doses may result in significant clinical activity provided the virus is not rapidly cleared by the immune system. This was observed in clinical trials with oncolytic poliovirus and T-VEC3. Finally, individual assays to assess virus distribution are needed to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of virus delivery. Ideally, this should include data on the presence of the virus within targeted cells (for example, cancer cells), lack of viral replication in non-target cells, virus shedding within body fluids, evidence of latent infection, viral clearance, and virus-specific and tumour-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Although many trials have made progress in establishing such assays, there is no standard agreement within the field on how to validate these correlative end points.\n\nSeveral strategies for clinical assessment of oncolytic viruses in vivo have been developed. The most common methods for determining tissue uptake have used the expression of fluorescent dyes, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) or luciferase, in the viral vector to quantitate viral transcription within infected cells166. This technique, however, is challenging in patients as it requires the inclusion of a foreign transgene with unknown clinical consequences, potential for immune recognition and difficulty in imaging fluorescent activity from deep tissue layers. By contrast, measles virus and HSV-1 have been engineered to express other proteins or enzymes that do not rely on fluorescence for in vivo monitoring. Measles virus has been engineered to encode the soluble extracellular domain of human CEA upstream of the nucleoprotein gene. This allows quantitative monitoring of viral gene expression through serial peripheral blood measurement of CEA levels167. Another interesting strategy utilized a measles virus expressing human thyroidal sodium iodide symporter (NIS)168. The NIS concentrates radioactive iodine, which can be monitored using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. An HSV-1 encoding viral TK and a mutated dopamine D2 receptor was used to trap radioactive tracers for monitoring virus location and replication ability169. In this system, viral TK phosphorylates injected radioactive 131I-labelled 2\u2032-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxy-1-beta-d-arabinofuranosyl-5-iodo-uracil (FIAU), which traps the radioactive signal within the cell170. The mutated dopamine D2 receptor acts in a similar fashion by trapping a radioactive tracer that can be monitored using PET imaging. In addition to imaging, tumour biopsy procedures can be performed, when accessible and appropriate, to determine viral titres in target and non-target tissues. Tumour biopsy samples can provide both functional data as well as information about the kinetics and propagation of the oncolytic virus. Collection of other body tissues, including blood, saliva and urine, may also provide indicators of viral replication and will be critical to ensure safety by determining the bioshedding dynamics of therapeutic oncolytic viruses.\n\nRegulatory and commercialization issues. The live replicating nature of oncolytic viruses poses unique regulatory and manufacturing issues. Most viruses are propagated in tissue cultures and this requires methods for high-titre virus production, testing for adventitial pathogens, and assessment of virus purity and replication potential. Thus, procedures for laboratory safety during manufacturing and vialing, product validation and purity, and quality of design that results from generating biologics in cell culture must be considered. For some viruses it has been difficult to generate very high titre lysates required for clinical dosing, and this can be a challenge for biotechnology manufacturing. These aspects have been reviewed extensively elsewhere171,172,173. Viral vaccines have provided the templates for the manufacture and regulation of oncolytic viruses. The FDA has published a draft guidance document titled \u201cGuidance for Industry: Design and Analysis of Shedding Studies for Virus or Bacteria-Based Gene Therapy and Oncolytic Products\u201d. Other relevant documents include the \u201cEuropean Directorate for the Quality of Medicines including Cell substrates for the production of vaccines for human use\u201d (Ref. 174) and \u201cTests for extraneous agents in viral vaccines for human use\u201d (Ref. 175). These provide guidelines for quality control testing of all materials and cells used in the generation of oncolytic viruses. Furthermore, intermediates and viral batches need to be tested for contamination and efficacy. However, removing contaminants, especially microbial or viral contaminants, proves to be more difficult for oncolytic viruses than for recombinant proteins because the methods used to remove these contaminants may also target the oncolytic virus. The quality of oncolytic virus preparation can be tested in control cells with a standard readout, in combination with a virus-specific neutralizing antibody to confirm that the effect is mediated by the virus. This approach has been adapted from the methods used to test human viral vaccines. This infrastructure should provide the additional framework needed for the widespread commercialization of oncolytic viruses for cancer therapy.\n\nThe demonstration of a significant improvement in durable responses for patients with melanoma who were treated with T-VEC has revolutionized the field of anticancer therapy with oncolytic viruses. However, the development of oncolytic viruses as therapeutic agents requires careful attention to establish appropriate clinical trial designs, dosing regimens, pharmacodynamic assays, educational programmes addressing biosafety concerns, as well as new manufacturing and regulatory pathways. Likewise, careful attention to patient selection will also be an important consideration. For example, immunocompromised patients may not be good candidates because oncolytic virus-mediated anti-tumour immunity could be compromised in these patients.\n\nNevertheless, oncolytic viruses have been associated with a very favourable risk\u2013benefit ratio, and continued development of this new class of drugs can be anticipated, with particular interest in combination approaches. Oncolytic virus immunotherapy is a highly promising approach and introduces a new class of drugs for treating patients with cancer."}
