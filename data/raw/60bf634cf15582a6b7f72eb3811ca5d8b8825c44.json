{"title": "Determination of Microsomal Laurie Acid Hydroxylase Activity by HPLC with Flow-Through Radiochemical Quantitation", "body": "Laurie acid (LA),' like prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes, is hydroxylated at the w and (w-l) positions by microsomal preparations isolated from both hepatic and extrahepatic tissue (l-6). The participation of cytochrome P-450 in LA metabolism has been demonstrated directly, in in vitro reconstituted cytochrome P-450 systems (7-9) and, indirectly, with the use of cytochrome P-450 inducers and inhibitors ( lo-12). These inhibitors and inducers have also been used to demonstrate that different cytochrome P-450 isozymes support the hydroxylation of LA at the o and (w-l) positions.\n\nSome of the earliest techniques that were ' Abbreviations used: LA, lauric acid; PG, prostaglandin; UDYA, IO-undecynoic acid; SK&F 525-A, 2diethylaminoethyl-2,2-diphenylvalerate hydrochloride; ACN, acetonitrile; PGE, prostaglandin E. utilized to assay microsomal LA hydroxylase activity included radio-gas chromatography (1, 2) and radio-thin-layer chromatography (8) . However, many of these techniques did not provide sufficient resolution for quantitation of the individual w-and (w-l)-hydroxylated metabolites of LA (8, 12) . One of the most popular methods for quantitation of LA and its metabolites involves HPLC separation and radiochemical quantitation of the methyl esters of LA and its hydroxylated metabolites (13) . This procedure has numerous steps and is therefore time consuming and subject to variability. Two groups have recently reported a simplified procedure for the quantitation of microsomal LA hydroxylation ( 11, 14) . This procedure involves HPLC separation of underivatized LA and the wand (o-1 )-hydroxylated metabolites. ROMAN0 ET AL.\n\nRecent data suggest that each hydroxylation reaction is catalyzed by a different isozyme(s) of cytochrome P-450 (12) . Therefore, quantitation of the individual metabolites of LA could be used for the characterization of a different isozyme(s) of cytochrome P-450. Studies by Kupfer and co-workers indicate that, in addition to hydroxylation at the w and (w-l) positions, hepatic microsomes also catalyze the hydroxylation of PGE, and PGEz at the (w-2) position ( 15, 16) . Therefore, it is feasible that other lipids such as LA could also be hydroxylated at the (o-2) position by microsomal incubations. In this paper, we describe a technique which allows rapid separation and quantitation of three microsomal metabolites [w-, (w-1 )-, and (o-2)-hydroxy] of LA. Furthermore, we describe an initial biochemical characterization of the three microsomal LA hydroxylases. St. Louis, MO) and water were available ad libitum. Rats were quarantined at least 2 weeks prior to use. Unfasted rats were killed by cervical dislocation and organs were excised immediately.\n\nMicrosomes were prepared as reported (17) and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. Protein concentrations were determined according to Gornall et al. (18) .\n\nAssay conditions. Reaction vessels contained microsomal protein (0.3-0.6 mg/ml), MgClz (5 mM), [r4C]lauric acid (0.1 IIIM, 10 mCi/mmol) and a regenerating system consisting of glucose 6-phosphate ( 12.5 mrvi) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (2.2 units/ml) dissolved in 1 ml of Tris-HCI (0.05 M), pH 7.5. For inhibition experiments, SK&F 525-A and metyrapone were dissolved directly in a small volume of Tris-HCl prior to addition to incubations;\n\n(Ynaphthoflavone was dissolved in acetone and coated on the walls of the incubation vessel, and the solvent was evaporated prior to addition of the microsomal suspension. After 1 min of preincubation, the reaction was started by addition of 1 pmol of NADPH. Samples were incubated for 10 min in a shaking water bath maintained at 37\u00b0C. Incubations were terminated with 0.4 ml of 10% H2S04. The acidified incubation mixture was extracted twice with 3 ml of fresh ether and the ether was evaporated under nitrogen at 30\u00b0C. The dried residue was resuspended in 250 ~1 of 67.5% ACN in 1% acetic acid. Extraction recovery was determined by counting 10 ~1 of the resuspended sample in 5 ml of Atomlight. Recovery of radioactivity from incubation mixtures was greater than 95%.\n\nQuantitation of LA and metabolites. LA and metabolites were separated on an HPLC system consisting of two Model 5 10 solvent delivery systems, a Model 720 system controller, and a Model 7 10B WISP autoinjector (Waters Assoc., Inc., Milford, MA) equipped with a model IC Flo-One Beta radiochemical detector (Radiomatic Instruments) outfitted with a 0.4-ml liquid flow cell. Quantitation was carried out with a S-pm Altex (Beckman Inst., Berkeley, CA) Cls column (4.6 X 250 mm) by gradient elution with acetic acid ( 1%) and ACN. Following injection of sample (25 pl), the percentage of ACN was held at 36% for 14 min, then increased linearly to 90% over 4 min, and held at 90% for 3 min prior to reequilibration.\n\nThe flow rate was maintained at 1.5 ml/min throughout the analysis. The scintillant (FLO-SCINT II) to HPLC effluent ratio was maintained at 3: 1, which provided a counting efficiency of 94%. Gradient conditions did not affect counting efficiency by greater than 5%. The recovery of radioactivity from the column was 97 + 1.2%.\n\nIsolation and identljication of LA metabolites. Hydroxylated metabolites of LA from the combined extracts of 20 incubations were separated on a 5-pm Altex (Beckman Inst.) Cl8 column (10 X 250 mm) by gradient elution with acetic acid (1%) and ACN. Following injection, the percentage of ACN was held at 36% for 25 min, then increased linearly to 90% over 2 min, and held at 90% for 2 min prior to reequilibration.\n\nThe flow rate was maintained at 3.5 ml/min throughout the analysis. Fractions were collected every 0.3 min. The radiochemical content of each fraction was determined and samples containing metabolites were evaporated under reduced pressure. The compounds were methylated with 250 ~1 of ethereal diazomethane, dried under nitrogen, and resus-pended in hexane. Each metabolite was further purified by thin-layer chromatography; methylated metabolites were applied to silica gel TLC plates (Whatman, Hillsboro, OR) which were developed in hexane:ether:acetic acid, 70:30: 1.5 (v/v). The plates were scanned with a Berthold Model LB 2832 TLC analyzer and the area corresponding to the radioactive peak was isolated and extracted twice in ether. The ether was dried under nitrogen and metabolites were resuspended in 5 ~1 of ACN and 5 ~1 of N,Obis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide containing 1% trimethylchlorosilane and were heated at 60\u00b0C for 35 min. Mass spectra of the trimethylsilyl ether methyl ester of each metabolite was obtained on a Finnigan 4500 gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (Finnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a bonded phase fused silica capillary column (30 m X 0.32 mm, DB-5,0.25-grn film, J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA) and an on-column injector which was maintained at room temperature. Following injection, the oven temperature was held at 50\u00b0C for 2 min, increased ballistically to lOO\"C, and then increased 4\"C/min to 250\u00b0C.\n\n[14C]LA, in the presence of NADPH, resulted in the formation of three metabolites ( Fig. 1 A) . These metabolites were not formed when NADPH was omitted from the incubation mixture (Fig. 1B) (Fig. 2C ). On the basis of C-value and mass spectra, metabolite I was identified as 11 -hydroxylauric acid [(w-l)hydroxylauric acid]; metabolite II was identified as IO-hydroxylauric acid [(w-2)-hydroxylauric acid] and metabolite III was identified as 12-hydroxylauric acid (w-hydroxylauric acid).\n\nResolution of the three microsomal metabolites of LA by flow-through radiochemical detection was dependent upon flow cell size and the scintillant to HPLC effluent ratio. By maintaining the scintillant to HPLC effluent ratio at 2:l and varying flow cell size it was possible to obtain baseline resolution of all three metabolites (Fig. 3) . Peaks I and II could not be resolved with a 2.5 ml flow cell; some resolution of these peaks was observed when a 1.0 ml flow cell was used. With the larger flow cells, some improvement in resolution was obtained by increasing the scintillant to HPLC effluent ratio from 2: 1 to 4: 1 (Fig. 4) . Quantitation of the three LA metabolites by flow-through radiochemical quantitation provided linear results over the ranges (0.375-26 nmol/ml) most ofien encountered in in vitro studies (Table 1) . At a specific activity for [ 14C]LA of 10 mCi/mmol, the effective limit of quantitation for each metabolite (assuming a 25-~1 injection) was approximately 0.25 nmol/ml. Below these concentrations, the variability of results (CV >20%) obtained was too great to allow quantitation of each metabolite.\n\nIn practical terms, rates as low as 12.5 pmol/mg protein/min can be accurately determined using standard assay conditions (10 min, 0.5 mg/ml, fourfold concentration following extraction). If metabolite formation was expected to be below this limit of quantitation, the specific activity of LA was increased to reduce the variability observed in quantitation of the metabolites or a larger volume was injected on column (volumes up to 75 ~1 could be injected without a noticeable decrease in resolution).\n\nThe formation of all three metabolites of LA by microsomal incubations was linear relative to time of incubation and protein concentration (Fig. 5) . The formation of all three metabolites could be supported by NADPH added directly or by NADPH generated from glucose 6-phosphate (Table 2 ) or isocitric acid (data not shown) regenerating systems. However, certain glucose 6-phosphate regenerating systems (Sigma) resulted in substantially less microsomal metabolism of LA when compared to the metabolism supported by NADPH alone (Table 2 ). This inhibition of LA hydroxylases was due to an inhibitor present in the glucose 6-phosphate. Glucose 6-phosphate from other sources (Fluka, Boehringer-Mannheim) did not inhibit LA formed were markedly different from those hydroxylases. The microsomal metabolism of formed in the presence of NADPH. Very little LA could also be supported by hydrogen per-w-hydroxy-LA was formed while the formaoxide ( Table 3 ). The formation of all three tion of the (w-l)-and (w-2)-hydroxylated melauric acid metabolites increased as the con-tabolites was similar to that supported by centration of Hz02 was increased in the incu-NADPH alone (Table 3) with metyrapone resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction of LA (w-l)-and (w-2)-hydroxylases; at 10m3 M, inhibition of both enzyme activities was approximately 60%. In contrast, metyrapone resulted in very little inhibition (~10%) of LA w-hydroxylases.\n\nThe acetylenic fatty acid, 1 0-undecynoic acid (UDYA), was also employed as a biochemical tool for dissociating LA hydroxylase activities. Preincubation of microsomes for periods up to 1 h resulted in a small (lo-20%) increase in all LA hydroxylase activities when compared to nonpreincubated controls. This increase in hydroxylase activities is unexplained but may reflect metabolism, during the preincubation period, of lipids which are released from the microsomal membrane and inhibit LA hydroxylases. Rat liver microsomes contain 2-2.5 nmol of free fatty acids, both saturated and unsaturated, per milligram of microsomal protein (19, 20) . As postulated by Kupfer and others, the amounts and ratios of these fatty acids may affect cytochrome P-450-dependent activities such as LA hydroxylases (2 1). Preincubation of microsomes with UDYA resulted in a time-dependent loss of LA W-, (w-l)-, and (w-2)-hydroxylase activities (Fig.  7A ). Nearly 50% of LA w-hydroxylase activity was inactivated by 50 I.IM UDYA. However, a much smaller percentage (20-30%) of LA (w-l)-and (w-2)-hydroxylases were destroyed under similar preincubation conditions. This preferential inactivation of LA whydroxylases was observed over a large concentration range of UDYA (Fig. 7B) . This differential inactivation of LA hydroxylases was not observed when a nonspecific suicide substrate for cytochrome P-450, l-aminobenzotriazole ( 12) , was preincubated with hepatic microsomes; approximately 70% of all three LA hydroxylase activities was lost following a 30-min preincubation with 100 PM 1 -aminobenzotriazole (data not shown).\n\nThe microsomal metabolism of LA has been investigated in a variety of in vitro sys- terns (1, 2, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . The metabolism of LA has which clofibrate is the prototypical inducer been used extensively to characterize a sub- (22) . The biochemical sequelae of this inpopulation of cytochrome F45Os, collec-duction is a dramatic increase in LA w-hytively referred to as cytochromes P-452 (8) . droxylase activity (22) . that at least three isozymes of cytochrome P-450 support the microsomal metabolism of LA (12) . Furthermore, the position of hydroxylation is dictated by the specific forms of cytochrome P-450 which are present in rat hepatic microsomes. Therefore, the site-specific hydroxylation of LA could be used to document the presence or absence of specific isozymes of cytochrome P-450 in microsomal suspensions.\n\nMany of the traditional methods used for assay of LA hydroxylase activity do not differentiate between the hydroxylated metabolites (8, 12) . However, the use of gas and, more recently, liquid chromatographic techniques has allowed the separation of the wand (w-l)-hydroxylated metabolites of LA ( 1,2,10,13). Both techniques generally require the use of a radiolabeled substrate and fairly elaborate derivatization techniques for quantitation and separation of permethylated metabolites. Orton and Parker have utilized reverse phase HPLC with flowthrough radiochemical detection to quantitate the w-and (w-l)-hydroxylated metabolites of LA without derivatization (11). Recently, Welch and coworkers have described a normal phase HPLC system for the separation of the w-and (w-I)-hydroxylated metabolites of LA ( 14). However, both of these analytical techniques have not been well characterized for precision, accuracy, and practical limits of quantitation.\n\nFurthermore, none of the above-mentioned techniques has allowed for the detection and quantitation of the (w-2)-hydroxylated metabolite of LA in mammalian microsomal incubations. The techniques described for quantitation of the three microsomal metabolites of LA in the present study provide reproducible and linear results over a range of concentrations that are anticipated for most in vitro conditions. The practical limit of quantitation of each LA metabolite was approximately 0.25 nmol/ml.\n\nUsing standard assay conditions, this would allow accurate quantitation of LA (w-2)-hydroxylase activities one-20th of those observed in most microsomal incubations from rats.\n\nThe hydroxylation of LA at the (w-2) position has been reported in certain plant and bacterial systems (23, 24) . Furthermore, the hydroxylation of PGEr and PGEz at the (w-2) position has been reported previously by Kupfer and co-workers (15) . However, the hydroxylation of LA at the (w-2) position has not been reported previously as a significant pathway of LA metabolism in mammalian microsomes. This is probably due to the inability to adequately resolve (w-2)-hydroxy-LA from (w-l)-hydroxy-LA.\n\nUsing reverse phase HPLC with flow-through radiochemical detection it is possible to adequately resolve (w-2)-and (w-l)-hydroxy-LA by decreasing the residence time within the radiochemical flow cell. As demonstrated in the present study, a decreased residence time can be achieved by increasing the flow rate through the cell as well as by decreasing the actual flow cell size. The (w-2)-hydroxylation of PGE, and PGE2 is also supported by hydrogen peroxide (15) . A similar phenomena was observed when LA was incubated in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.\n\nAs has been previously reported for PGE, and PGE2 ( 15), hydrogen peroxide-dependent metabolism of LA resulted in a ratio ((w-l) or (w-2)/0) of hydroxylated metabolites that was markedly different than that produced when NADPH was used to support LA metabolism. This suggests that the w-hydroxylation of LA was supported by different isozymes of cytochrome P-450 than those which support the (o-l)-and (o-2)-hydroxylations of LA. Previous investigators, utilizing suicide substrates and competitive inhibitors of LA metabolism, have demonstrated that the w-and (w-1)-hydroxylations of LA are supported by different isozymes of cytochrome P-450 (10,12). In the present study, similar approaches for dissociating the three (o-, w-l, w-2) lauric acid hydroxylase activities were utilized in an attempt to demonstrate isozyme specific positional hydroxylation of LA. The competitive inhibitors, cY-naphthoflavone, metyrapone, and SK&F 525-A, had differential effects on the various LA hydroxylases. While SK&F 525-A inhib-lases could not be achieved with the orobes 14. Clarke, M. J., Hawke, R. L., and Welch, R. M. used in the present study suggesting that a similar isozyme(s) of cytochrome P-450 supports these two hydroxylations. Further confirmation of these results will require purification of all three enzyme activities from hepatic microsomes.\n\nIn summary, an assay for the microsomal hydroxylation of LA, based on HPLC with flow-through radiochemical detection, has been developed. The products formed, (w)hydroxy-LA, (o-I)-hydroxy-LA, and the novel mammalian metabolite (w-2)-hydroxy-LA, could be quantitated with high precision and accuracy with minimal sample manipulation.\n\nThe biochemical dissociation of o-hydroxylase activity from (o-l)-and (w-2)-hydroxylases suggests that different isozymes of cytochrome P-450 support these reactions."}
