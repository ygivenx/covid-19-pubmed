{"title": "Mouse hepatitis virus A59 increases steady-state levels of MHC mRNAs in primary glial cell cultures and in the murine central nervous system", "body": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of the Coronaviridae, has been widely studied as a model of human neurologic infections . MHV strains A59 and JHM cause an acute necrotizing encephalitis in mice after intracerebral inoculation . Animals surviving the acute infection often develop a chronic disease characterized by demyelination of neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) .\n\n1-5 J . L . Gombold and S. R . Weiss in JHM-infected mice and that CD8 + , major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-restricted T cells are important in viral clearance . [6] [7] [8] [9] In addition, MHC class (restricted T cells, possibly suppressor/cytotoxic T cells (CTL), have been isolated from mice infected with JHM . 10, \"\n\nThe mechanism of MHV-induced demyelination is not well understood . Early evidence suggested that demyelination resulted from direct viral lysis of oligodendrocytes . [12] [13] [14] In contrast, Watanabe et al.\" demonstrated adoptive transfer of subacute demyelination with T cells from JHM-infected rats . More recently, Wang et a1. 16 showed that demyelination could be prevented by irradiation of JHM-infected mice and that such mice would undergo demyelination after transfer of T cells from infected mice . Although these data strongly suggest that immune-mediated mechanisms may be active in demyelination, they do not rule out completely the possibility of viral cytotoxicity to oligodendrocytes .\n\nWe have shown previously that MHV-A59 infection of glial cells in vitro causes an enhanced expression of surface MHC, class I molecules on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes 1718 and that this enhancement is probably mediated by a soluble factor, synthesized by astrocytes . 17 In persistently infected glial cells, MHC-enhancement is dependent on continual virus production .\" We show here that MHCenhancement may be observed at the mRNA level in glial cultures and that CNS infection of mice by A59 also increases the steady-state levels of MHC mRNA . Elevated expression occurs in both infected and uninfected cells, both in vivo and in vitro, supporting the hypothesis that a soluble factor is involved in the induction .\" The increases in MHC expression during infection of the murine CNS as well as in glial cell cultures suggests a potential role for MHC class I molecules in the pathogenesis of MHV-A59-induced disease .\n\nWe demonstrated previously that MHC class I antigens are expressed at high levels on the surface of MHV-A59 infected astrocytes and oligodendrocytes when compared to uninfected cells .' 1, 18 We wanted to determine if these changes were a result of an increase in MHC-specific mRNAs . We show here that infection of cells in culture as well as in vivo causes a rapid increase in both MHC class I and class II mRNAs .\n\nMHC mRNA induction in vitro in glial cell cultures Mixed glial cell cultures were derived by mechanical dissociation of newborn mouse brain . Greater than 90% of the cells in these cultures are positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as determined by immunostaining, suggesting they are of the astroglial lineage ; 19,31 (data not shown) . Confluent monolayers of cells were infected with A59 at high multiplicity as described in Materials and methods . At regular intervals, total RNA was isolated from the cells, bound to nylon membranes, and hybridized with single-stranded RNA probes specific for MHC class I mRNA ; the amount of probe that hybridized was quantitated by counting sections of the membrane containing individual RNA samples with a scintillation counter . The amount of positivesense probe that bound to the membrane was used as an estimate of non-specific binding and background . As shown in Table 1 , uninfected mixed glial cultures express low levels of class I mRNA . However, these cells respond rapidly to infection with an increase in class I expression that, by day 3, approaches six-fold . Class I transcripts decreased thereafter, returning to levels observed in mock-infected cells or below by day 10 .\n\nTo verify and extend these results, both virus-infected and mock-infected cultures were examined for class I expression by in situ hybridization . These experiments failed to show expression of class I mRNA in mock-infected cells hybridized with the negative-sense probe (Fig . 1A) . In contrast, a marked increase in MHC class I expression was observed in A59-infected cells (Fig . 1 B) . Expression was observed in the majority of cells indicating that the elevation was not a result of a minor cell type responding to infection . Control experiments in which infected cells were treated with the positive-sense probe did not reveal significant hybridization (Fig . 1 C) . We suggest that astrocytes, the major cell type in these cultures, have the ability to elevate class I mRNA expression in response to infection .\n\nThe increased expression observed in vitro following infection, together with results from others showing class I-restricted immune responses involved in viral clearance,\" suggested that MHC class I transcripts would likely be elevated in vivo during the acute infection . We inoculated mice intracerebrally with 1 LD 50 of A59 or, as a control, with an uninfected cell lysate . At regular intervals, mice were sacrificed and total cell RNA was isolated from the brains . Northern blots, hybridized with the MHC class I probe, showed no difference in the level of expression between mock-infected and virus-infected animals sacrificed immediately following inoculation ( Fig . 2A) . Within 24 h of inoculation, class I transcripts had increased in virus-infected mice but not in mock-infected controls . Expression was maximal, approximately 5 days post-infection (pi), but was still elevated 2 weeks after infection . Slight fluctuations in expression occurred between 3 and 16 weeks pi but the significance of the changes is not clear (Fig . 2B ) . In contrast, the level of class I expression in mock-infected animals remained constant over the time course of the experiment .\n\nThe same blots were used to examine expression of MHC class II mRNA . Again, we found significantly greater levels of expression in infected mice compared to mockinfected controls ( Fig . 2A and B ) but the kinetics of expression were slower than those for class I . Class II transcripts were first detected at 3 days pi and reached maximal levels 10-14 days pi . However, we observed elevated levels of expression as late as 8 weeks pi .\n\nViral RNA was first detected 3 days pi, coincident with the expression of MHC class II mRNA ( Fig . 2A) . However, unlike either class I or class II expression, viral RNA was observed only up to 10 days pi . During subsequent time points when MHC expression remained high, viral RNA was not detectable . Genome and all subgenomic mRNAs were detected although the four smallest mRNA species predominated . The kinetics of viral gene expression detected here were consistent with titers of virus in infected brain' (data not shown) .\n\nAlthough it was unlikely that the increased expression of MHC genes observed here was a result of variability in the amount of RNA analyzed by Northern blots, we chose to examine the levels of actin mRNA in these samples as a control . Figure 2 shows that while minor differences exist from sample to sample, this variability could not account for extensive increases in MHC gene expression that were observed . In addition, these results demonstrate that actin expression remained relatively constant during the time course of infection, indicating that the elevation of MHC gene expression was not part of a generalized increase in mRNA levels .\n\nIn situ hybridization was used to confirm these results and to determine where in the brain MHC or virus mRNA expression occurred and whether the increases in MHC mRNAs were restricted to foci or infection or inflammation . For these experiments, an independent group of mice was inoculated with A59 or an uninfected cell lysate as described above . Mice were selected at various times after infection without regard to signs of disease and sacrificed . Brain sections were prepared and hybridized with single-stranded probes for virus, MHC class I, or class II . Viral gene expression was focal and largely restricted to the limbic and olfactory systems and is similar to that found when measuring viral antigens in the CNS . 20,21 Viral RNA was initially detected in the olfactory bulbs (Fig . 3A) and in paraventricular areas, most notably the medial and lateral septum (Fig . 3C) . Foci of infection were also observed in the caudate putamen (Fig . 3C) and occasionally in cells of the ependyma ( Fig . 3C and E) . Viral RNA could also be detected in the brain stem by 7 days pi (data not shown) . We rarely observed evidence of virus in the cerebral cortex or in the cerebellum . Examination of these sections also showed little inflammation, most of which was observed in the meninges (data not shown) . While regions of encephalitis were observed, they were highly focal and few in number . The kinetics of expression of MHC class I mRNA as revealed by in situ hybridization was consistent with the results of the Northern blots described above . Expression was largely undetectable in brains of mock-infected controls (Fig . 4) or in virus-infected animals sacrificed immediately following infection (data not shown) . However, between 3 and 7 days pi, the number of cells expressing class I transcripts as well as the level of expression consistently increased . While expression did not appear to be restricted to any specific regions or to areas of infection or inflammation, the highest levels of expression were observed within regions previously described as major sites of viral replication 20 '21 ( Fig . 3) . The olfactory bulbs showed extensive expression of MHC class I in the meninges and the olfactory nerve layer (Fig . 4A) . Expression was also markedly elevated in the choroid plexus (Fig . 4B ) and throughout the medial and lateral septum (Fig . 4C and D) . Positive-stranded probes used for controls did not hybridize in sections from virus-or mock-infected animals (data not shown) .\n\nKinetics of class II mRNA expression detected by in situ hybridization was also consistent with the results of the Northern blots described above . Mice infected for 1 day or less did not appear to express class II mRNA (data not shown) . There was an increase in expression in A59-infected mice by 3 to 5 days pi and was quite elevated near the ventricles, especially near the ependyma (Fig . 5A ) and the choroid plexus (Fig . 5C ) . In contrast, mock-infected mice showed little if any expression of MHC class II mRNA in these areas ( Fig . 5B and D) . However, we noted that the expression of class II was more focal than that of class I, indicating that inflammatory cells might be contributing to the increased expression . As expected, controls using positivestrand RNA probes failed to hybridize regardless of the inoculum or the time after infection (data not shown) .\n\nAreas of the brain that contained viral mRNA always exhibited elevated levels of MHC transcripts . However, high levels of MHC mRNA were found in regions of the brain lacking viral RNA. For example, virus was rarely detected within the choroid plexus (Fig . 3C ), yet the expression of MHC mRNA was often high (Figs 4C and 5C) . Thus, we conclude that MHC gene expression is not restricted to foci of infection or inflammation and may therefore be modulated indirectly .\n\nWe have reported previously 18 that infection of either primary mixed glial cultures or of astrocyte-enriched cultures with A59 caused increased expression of MHC class I, but not class II, antigens on the cell surface . Our results here show that infection of mixed glial cell cultures with mouse hepatitis virus causes an accumulation of MHC class I mRNA which presumably leads to the increase of MHC class I antigens on the cell surface . Since more than 95% of cells in these cultures are astrocytes or precursors of astrocytes (as measured by reaction with anti-GFAP serum) and in excess of 80% of the cells are positive for MHC mRNA, MHC-enhancement clearly occurs in astrocytes . This is consistent with our previous double immunofluorescence results showing that antisera that recognize MHC and GFAP or galactocerebroside (GaIC) stain the same cells .\" Microglia, which represent no more than a small percentage of cells in these primary cultures, 19 may also respond to infection by increasing the level of MHC mRNA and antigen ; however, because of their small number in these cultures, microglia cannot account for all of the MHC expression that is observed .\n\nWe demonstrate here that CNS infection of C57BL/6 mice by A59 caused a transient increase in the steady-state levels of MHC class I and class II mRNA . Class I mRNA was first observed 1 day after infection, prior to the onset of detectable viral RNA synthesis as well as inflammatory cell infiltration . At the later times post-infection that were examined (3-16 weeks), class I and class II expression showed some variability . For example, neither was expressed at elevated levels 3 weeks pi, but both were present at high levels at 4, 6 and 8 weeks pi . It is tempting to speculate that the increases seen at 4-8 weeks pi might be occurring at times of active demyelination . Elevated levels of MHC mRNA were observed in cells without detectable viral RNA, demonstrating that the enhancement was not occurring solely in infected cells, consistent with the results from primary glial cultures . Furthermore, cells with detectable MHC mRNA were found throughout the brain, while inflammatory cells were found in foci, particularly in perivascular regions . These data along with the observation that MHC class I induction occurs in primary cultures of glial cells (both GFAP-positive and GaIC-positive) suggest that it is unlikely that MHC mRNA enhancement in the CNS is only a result of inflammatory cells . However, the rather focal regions of class II expression may result, at least in part, from inflammatory infiltrates in the brain . The increase in MHC expression did not appear to be part of a general effect of infection on cellular mRNA levels since actin mRNA levels remained constant . The results also show that increases in MHC expression during infections in vivo are similar to increases observed in vitro in infected glial cell cultures .\n\nIn these experiments, we found that viral RNA was largely restricted to the olfactory and limbic systems during the early stages of infection . This is consistent with our previous localization of MHV-A59 antigen during acute infection . 2021 Although these sites are major areas of MHC expression during infection, MHC-specific mRNA was observed also in regions of the brain outside of these systems and devoid of viral RNA . This observation suggests that the induction may be mediated by lymphokines or related soluble factors induced by infection . Our earlier experiments\" ,18 showed that a factor capable of inducing MHC expression on glial cells was produced by astrocytes but not oligodendrocytes, microglia, or meningeal fibroblasts in vitro following infection with A59 . Biochemical and physical characterizations suggested that the factor is not interferon . Although this unidentified factor has only been detected following infections in vitro, it is possible that it may have a significant role during infection given the many recent reports describing H2-restricted T cells involved in viral clearance and demyelination (see below) . However, we do not discount the possibility that non-CNS cell types (e .g . immune cells) also may produce this factor .\n\nWork now in progress is aimed at identifying the potential role of T cells in the induction of MHC expression and its relationship to both the acute and chronic disease .\n\nOther viruses have been identified that either negatively or positively regulate the expression of MHC antigens . [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] In the cases of infections of cells with Moloney murine leukemia virus or certain flaviviruses 26,29 control of the MHC mRNA level is thought to be transcriptional . Our results demonstrate higher steady-state levels of MHC mRNA after MHV-A59 infection . Although these results are consistent with increased transcription of MHC genes, we cannot rule out the possibility that the elevation results from changes in the stability of MHC transcripts .\n\nThe role of MHC antigens during the acute and chronic stages of the CNS disease caused by MHV is not entirely clear . Clearance of infectious virus usually occurs by 4 weeks pi and, in the case of MHV-JHM, involves both CD4' and CD8' T cells . 89 This implies a role for both MHC class I and class II in the resolution of the acute disease . The data presented here show that expression of MHC genes was quite pronounced for the first 10 days of infection and that loss of detectable viral RNA coincided with the elevation of MHC mRNAs . Sussman et a/. $ identified a CD4' T cell required for clearance of JHM from the mouse CNS . These cells appeared to be helper-inducer T cells that acted together with class I-restricted CD8' T cells to effect viral clearance . It was speculated that the CD8' cells might be cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), not unlikely since the isolation of class I-restricted, CD8', CTL clones from JHM-infected mice have been reported .\" , \" Class II-restricted T cells mediating a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) have also been identified in JHM-infected mice .\"' These T cells protect mice from lethal disease when challenged with JHM but do not prevent growth of the virus in the CNS .\n\nTwo mechanisms have been proposed to explain the primary demyelination observed in this system . One suggests that the demyelination is a result of direct cytolytic activity of the virus on oligodendrocytes . 12-14 This hypothesis was supported by the early report that immunosuppression does not alter the course of demyelination in infected animals .\" A second hypothesis states that the demyelination is immunemediated and is supported by experiments showing induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)-like lesions in uninfected animals by transfer of lymphocytes from JHM-infected rats .\" Lymphocytes from infected rats were sensitized to both myelin basic protein and JHM particles as shown by proliferative responses when cultured in the presence of either antigen . More recent evidence for an immunopathological mechanism of MHV-induced demyelination has been provided by Wang et a/. 16 who showed that irradiation of mice prevented demyelination by JHM and that demyelination could be restored by adoptive transfer of spleen cells . The activity of the transferred cells appeared to be MHC restricted . Finally, it has been suggested that the acute demyelination observed early in the infection may be a result of cytolysis of oligodendrocytes and the subacute or chronic demyelination to immune-mediated mechanisms . 30 The increase in MHC antigen expression on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes during MHV-A59 infections is well established .\" We show here that this increase is likely to be the result of an elevation of MHC mRNA . Given the evidence accumulating for an immunopathological mechanism in MHV-induced demyelination, 16 .16 it will be important to identify the types and specificities of T cells in the CNS and determine the role of MHC antigens in acutely and chronically infected mice .\n\nVirus and ce//s . MHV strain A59 was propagated in a mouse fibroblast cell line and filtered (0 .2 \u00b5m) prior to use . The LD 50 of A59 was determined by end-point dilution in 4--6 week old male C57BL/6 mice . Primary mixed glial cell cultures were made from dissociated brains of newborn C57BL/6 mice essentially as described by Lavi et a/. 31 and were used 10-15 days after plating . These cultures contained 90-95% astrocytes as determined by immunostaining of glial fibrillary acidic protein 31 (data not shown) . These cultures also contain a few percent oligodendrocytes (measured by staining with antisera against galactocerebroside) and microglia (measured by phagocytosis of latex beads) . Primary glial cultures and 17 Cl-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) . EL-4 cells (an MHC-class I positive murine lymphoma cell line obtained from Glen Gaulton, University of Pennsylvania, PA) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS .\n\nMice . Four to six week-old male, MHV-antibody free, C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) . A59 was diluted to 50 LD 50 per ml (approximately 2 .5X105 pfu/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0 .75% bovine serum albumin and 20 yl of this was injected into the left cerebral hemisphere of mice . Mock-infected controls received uninfected 17 CI-1 cell lysates comparably diluted . Virus-infected animals were housed in isolation for the duration of the experiments .\n\nRNA isolation . (a) From glial cell cultures . Cells growing in 60 mm dishes (1 .4x10 6 cells) were washed three times with cold Dulbecco's PBS and then lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCI, pH 8/100 mm NaCI/1 % Nonidet P-40 . The lysate was adjusted to 25 mm EDTA/1 %SDS/200 \u00b5g Proteinase K per ml and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min . After extraction with phenol/chloroform, the RNA was precipitated with ethanol, washed once, and resuspended in water . (b) From brain . Brains were removed and washed once with Dulbecco's PBS . The tissue was homogenized in 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (BMB) and layered over a cushion of 5 .7 M CsCl . The RNA was pelleted in an SW41 rotor at 32000 rpm, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCI, pH 7 .4/1 mm EDTA, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and precipitated as described above . The RNA was washed once, resuspended in water, and quantitated by UV spectroscopy .\n\nNorthern blots . RNA (10 \u00b5g) was resuspended in 20 mm MOPS/1 mm EDTA/5 mm Na acetate/2 .2 M formaldehyde/50% formamide and denatured by heating at 65\u00b0C for 10 min . After electrophoresis through a 1% agarose gel containing 2 .2 M formaldehyde, the RNA was transferred to nylon membranes (Gene Screen Plus, New England Nuclear) and hybridized with [ 32 P]-cDNA probes in 50% formamide at 42\u00b0C according to the manufacturer's suggestions .\n\nMembranes were rinsed twice with 2xSSC at room temperature, washed twice with 2 x SSC/0 .1 % SDS at 60\u00b0C, twice with 0 .1 x SSC at room temperature, and exposed to X-ray film at -80\u00b0C .\n\nDot blots. Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from either mock-or A59-infected glial cells as described above . Samples were adjusted to 6% formaldehyde/50% formamide, denatured, and 10 pg of RNA was spotted onto Gene Screen Plus membranes . RNA probes, transcribed in vitro as described below and labeled with [ 32 P]-UTP, were hybridized at 75\u00b0C in 5xSSPE (1 xSSPE is 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaH 2 PO 4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7 .4)/2xDenhardt's solution [1 x Denhardt's is 0 .02% (w/v) each ficoll, bovine serum albumin, polyvinylpyrrolidone)/1 SDS/100 pg/ml salmon sperm DNA/50% formamide] . Following hybridization, the membranes were washed three times in 0 .1 xSSPE/0 .1 % SDS at 75\u00b0C and exposed to X-ray film at -80\u00b0C . Bound probe was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting .\n\nIn situ hybridization. Hybridizations were performed on frozen brain sections or on infected cells as described previously .\" Briefly, samples were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, incubated in 0 .1 M Tris/0 .1 M glycine, acetylated in 0 .1 M triethanol amine-HCI, pH 8/0 .25% acetic anhydride, and then dehydrated through graded ethanols . [ 35 S]-labeled RNA probes were allowed to hybridize at 50\u00b0C for 4 h in 10% dextran sulfate/1 x Denhardt's solution/4 x SSC/10 mm DTT/1 mg yeast RNA per ml/1 mg salmon sperm DNA per ml/50% formamide . Following hybridization, samples were washed twice in 2xSSC/50% formamide at 52\u00b0C and digested with RNase A in 2xSSC at 37\u00b0C . The samples were then rinsed in 2xSSC/50% formamide at 52\u00b0C, washed overnight in 2xSSC/0 .05% Triton X-100, and dehydrated through graded ethanols . Slides were coated with emulsion (NTB-2, Kodak) and exposed for 3-6 weeks at 4\u00b0C .\n\nNucleic acid probes. DNA probes used for hybridization included (1) a 1 .2 kb MHC class I cDNA (pH211 ; 33), (2) a 1 kb MHC class II cDNA (obtained from J . Woodward, University of Kentucky, KY), (3) a 3 kb viral cDNA derived from the 3' end of the A59 genome containing sequences from viral genes 4, 5, 6 and 7 (clone 320 ; unpublished data), and (4) a previously described actin-specific 3 kb EcoRl fragment obtained from R . Weinmann, Wistar Institute .\"\n\nProbes were labeled with [32 P]-dCTP by random priming to 5 x 10 6 cpm/\u00b5g or greater .\n\nRNA probes were transcribed in vitro in the presence of [35 S]-UTP from cDNAs subcloned into pGEM plasmids (Promega) containing promoters for SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases in opposite orientations . Specific activities were generally 1-5x10 $ cpm/\u00b5g . RNA probes for in situ hybridizations were hydrolyzed to approximately 100 base pairs prior to use .\n\nWe wish to thank Anita Jackson for the preparation of frozen sections, Frank Baldino and Elane Robbins of Cephalon, Inc . for assistance with in situ hybridizations, Crystal Thorpe for technical assistance, and Ehud Lavi for help with the neuropathology .
