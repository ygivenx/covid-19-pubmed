{"title": "Protein Composition of Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus", "body": "Tomato spot.ted wilt virus (TSWV) has been partially purified by several workers (Black et al., 1963; Martin, 1964; Best, 1966 , van Kammen et al.. 1966 Tsakiridis and Gooding, 1972) but' little is known about its detailed structure and composition (Best, 1968) . Virus particles, about 75-S.5 nm in diameter, appear spherical in thin sections of infected plant cells (Rlilne, 1970) , and pleomorphic 1s hen examined in negative11 stained preparations (van Kammen et aZ., 1966; Rlilne! 1970) . The part#icles have outer envelopes with surface projections but no details of the int,ernal structure have been observed. Xlne (1967) noted the similarity of TSWV particles to those of influenza virus and Best (1968) suggested t'hat TSWV is essentially a \"pleomorphic myxovirus.\" However, in a recent attempt to classify plant viruses, Harrison et al. (1971) proposed a monotypic group for TSWV.\n\nIn this paper, we describe t,he protein composition of TSWV purified by a method modified from t,hat, of Black et al. (1963) . An investigation into the synthesis of virusinduced proteins in tobacco leaves infected wit.1~ TSWV is also reported.\n\nAn isolate of TSKV from Dahlia, collected at the Waite Institute, was used in all experiments. Virus was maint,ained on Datum strantonium L. in a glasshouse at 22-30 C. Infectivity was assayed on Nicotiatta ta.ba.eum L. cv. White Burley (Mohamed and Randles, 1972) .\n\nFor the studies on protein synthesis in virus-infected plants, Rhit,e Burley plants grown in t.hr glasshouse were inoculated and transferred to a growth cabinet maintained at 28 f 1 C with a daylength of 14 hr and a light intensity of 23,000 lx. Protein sgnthesis n-as studied in the first systemically infected 1ca.f (Rlohamed and Randles, 19'72) Purified virus was prepared as described in Fig. 1 and dissociated into polypeptides by heating for 2 hr at 60 C in protein extraction buffer (0.005 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 5 M urea, and 0.005 Al 2-mercaptoethanol).\n\nAlternat,ively, in some experiments, preparations were heated at 100 C for 2 min. The extracts were then dialysed for 16 hr against dialysis buffer (0.005 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2,0.1% SDS, 0.5 h9 urea, and 0.005 hi 2-mercaptoethanol).\n\nSucrose was added to the samples to a final concentration of 10% before electrophoresis. Protein markers, used in determining molecular weights, were treated in the same way.\n\nCylindrical gels (8 cm long) containing either 5 or 10 '-% acrylamide n-crc pwparod in glass tubes 9 cm X 0.G cm, as drscribed b> Dunker and Ruekrrt (1969) . The elcctrophoresis buffer contained 0.1 -II sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.1% SDS, ancl 0.5 III urea. Fifty to 100 &ers of the samples containing 10-50 pg of prokin were la.ycrrd on top of the gels and rlect8rophoresis was carried out. Bromophenol blue was added to all gels as a marker. For protein staining, gels wre immersed in a solution of 50% methanol-7 \"'c acetic acid cont8aining 0.2 C; Coomassie Blue (RIaizel, 1971) for 2-4 hr at 40 C. Gels were destained in 7% acetic acid at 40 C over a period of several days. For staining of &TOproteins, gels were osidizcd in 1 ? pf>riodic acid in 3% acetic acid at. 10 C for 1 hr, rinsed in n-at,er for 1 hr and stained with Schiff's reagent for 43 min (Clark, 1964j. Gels were destained in water, and stored in 10; sodium metabisulphitc.\n\nA tzalysis of T7im8 Itrduced Proteins ,itt Itlfected Tissues Leaf &sue from healthy and infected tobacco plants was sliced into skips 1 mm X .5 mm and infiltrated wit,h 0.01 31 phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 60 pg/ml act,inomycin D (AnJD)y 300 pg :ml cephaloridine, and 10 pg;'ml rimocidin (Jensen et al., 1971 j. Infiltration was carried out by applying vacuum with an air pump, three times for 30 see each time. The t,issues were incubated in the dark at 2.5 C for 4 hr and then 20 #2i of [3H]valinc n-as added t,o the infected tissue and 3 PCi of [W]valine to the healthy tissue. The infikration n-as repeated and the tissues wrr incubated at 2.5 C under a light intensiby of 2300 lx.\n\nAfter incubation, the tissues were homogenized in 10 WI (n ,/v-) of *'grinding buffer\" (Zait, lin and Hariharesubramanian, 197\" ) and centrifuged at l.OOOg for 10 min to sediment intact nuclei and chloropla.sts. The pellet was resuspended in \"grinding buffer\" and Triton x-100 was added to 1 CC to solubilizc chloroplasts. The solution wa,s rccentrifuged at' 1,OOOg for 10 mill and the resukant pellet. and supernatant were classrd m crude 'inuclear\" and \"chloroplast,\" frac-tions, wspcctivcly.\n\nThe sqwrnatant from the tirst wntrifugntion \\I IS centrifuged at 20,OOUy for 10 min to wdimcnt a crud? \"mitocholldrial\" pellet nliil~ the, supernatnnt was claswd as thr \"c!-toplnsmic,\" frnctir,n. The \"nuckar\" and \"mitoChcltidria1\" pellets n-cw rcsuspcndcd in protein extraction buffer while SDS and urea ncrcs added to 1 ?; and ii JI. respectively, to the \"chloroplast\" and \"cytoplasmic\" superwtanta.\n\nProteins n ere extracted as described above and the pIYJtI?in patterns of healthy and infected tissues n-we compared by coelectrophorrsis in 10 5 polyacrylamide gels. Samples (30-60 pliters) ncrc~ loaded on the dame gel and after elcctrophorcsis the gels n-we frozc11, sliced, and the radioactivitics mrasurcd (Nohamed and Randlcs, 1972 When prokin extracts of TSKV preparations n-we analysed by PAGE 011 5 \"S, gels Wig. 4a), 7 proteins were detected. Three of these (nos. 2, 3, and -I) \\lr-cre major proteins and constituted about 98 c'i, of the total protein of the virus preparation (Table 1) Their mean molecular weights, determined with t.he aid. of marker proteins (Fig. 5) were: 84,OOOd (2), 50,OOOd (3), and 29,OOOd (4). A minor protein, of MW 2201000d (l), was found in all preparations and constituted about, 1% of the total prot#ein. Three other proteins (nos. 5, 6, and T), were also present in some preparations (Fig. 4a, Table 1 ). However, when prot.ein extracts were heated at 100 C for 2 min, proteins 5 and 6 (of MW 160,000 and 132,OOOd) were eliminated, indicating t,hat they were probably aggregates of t,he major proteins. Protein 7 was also present in extracts from heakhy leaf tissue processed as described in Fig. 1 , indicating t,hat this protein was probably a host cont,aminant,. Staining of gels for carbohydrate indicated that t,he three major proteins, numbers 2,3, and 4 were glycoproteins (Fig. 4b) .\n\nAnalysis of protein extracts on 10%. gels revealed only-proteins 2, 3, 4, and 7, as the others were of too high a molecular weight to ent,er the gel. Molecular weights of the proteins determined from their mobilities in 10 % gels gave slightly different values from those calculated from 5 % gels.\n\nProteim Associatecl with the Nonidet-Resistant Xubuiral Particles TSWV treat,ed with Nonidet P-40 sedimented more slowlv than intact virus on sucrose density grakcnts (Fig. 6 ) and four components of slightly different sedimentation rates were detected. Electron microscopic examination of Nonidet-treated virus showed that the outer layer of projections and the outer envelope had been rcmowd (Fig. 7) releasing the core which was apparently still enclosed within a coat (Fig.  7B ). The subviral particle n-as 30 %, smaller than the intact virus, with a mean diameter of 60 nm (av for 20 particles) compared with a mean diametw of S5 nm for the intact FtG. 3. Electron micrographs of TSWV purified by the method described in Fig. 1 and stained The two high MW proteins in (c) of MW 105-115,COOd are probably aggregates.\n\nparticle. There is a marked resemblance between the subviral particle and t#he 55-nm particles reported by Best and Palk (1964) suggesting that, these authors were examining particles that had lost their envelope and projections during purification. Infectivity of the virus was considerably reduced on treatment wilth Nonidet-one lesion was produced by Nonidet-treat)ed virus while an equivalent amount of intact virus produced a total of 143 lesions on four tobacco halfleaves.\n\nAnalysis of the proteins from Nonidet,treated virus showed that proteins 1 and 4 were present in amounts comparable with those found in the intact virus (Fig. 4~) ; only traces of prot,eins 2 and 3 were present. Proteins 5, 6, and 7 were not detect,ed although two other minor bands, of JIW 105,OOOd and 115,OOOd were present; these were probably aggregates as they were not detected in preparations of intact, virus. clearing and incubat,ed for 4 hr in AniD in the dark. The tissues were labeled for 8 hr (96-104 hr after inoculation)-a time at which virus synthesis is rapid (Rlohamed and Randles, 1972) . The tissues were fractionated into crude subcellular fractions, proteins were ext,racted and compared by coelectrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels.\n\nThe results (Fig. 8) show that no proteins specific t,o diseased tissues could be detected in the \"chloroplast\" and \"cytoplasmic\" fractions while one virus-specific protein was detected in both the \"nuclear\" and \"mitochondrial\" fract,ions. The molecular weight of this virus specific protein was 49,OOOd corresponding wilth prot,ein 3 (Table 1) was treated with 1% Nonidet P-40 and similar amounts of treated and untreated virus were layered on gradients which were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 45 min in a Spinco SW 41 rotor.\n\n\"nuclear\" fract#ion was probably due to a reduction in infectivity following treatment with Triton X-100. As t,he virus-specific protein is associated with the virus-enriched fractions and it,s molecular weight is similar to that of prot#ein 3, it is probable that this prot,ein is a virus structural protein. The minor peaks in Fig. 8 were not considered to be significant, as they were not detected consistently although one of hhem (at fraction 9) corresponds in molecular weight to struct,ural protein number 2.\n\nSimilar experiments were carried out at other times after infection of the leaf to determine whether this or any other virusinduced proteins could be detected. No virusinduced proteins were detectable until 96 hr after inoculation alt,hough virus entered the leaf at 48 hr and was detectable by infectivity assay '72 hr after inoculation (Mohamed and Randles, 1972 4c ) and may be a constituent of the coat purified preparations of TSWV showed that surrounding the viral core (Fig. 7B ). Proteins fractions. The distribution of virus in the fractions, as determined by infectivity assay on 12 t,obacco half leaves was: nuclear-10 lesions, chloroplast-1 lesion, mit,ochondrial-46 lesions, cytoplasmic-5 lesions.\n\n2 and 3, which are also glycoproteins, appear to be constituents of the detergent-soluble viral envelope and the outer layer of projections. The minor protein 1, also found in nTonidet-treated preparat#ions, may be associated with the nucleic acid which is present in preparations of the detergenkesistant subviral particles (unpublished results).\n\nThe molecular weight determinations of the proteins can be considered only approximations as there are several errors inherent in the PAGE technique (Pllaizel, 1971) , especially when estimating molecular weights of glycoproteins (nos. 2-4) or high molecular weight proteins (no. 1).\n\nThe unusual feature of the proteins of TSWV is t,hat all t'hree major proteins are glycoproteins, including protein 4 which is associated n ith t,he detergent-resistant subviral particle. These results suggest, t,hat# TSWV may have three layers surrounding a core of \"naked\" nucleic acid as suggested by Best, (1968j . The outermost layer is composed of projections, the middle layer is an envelope soluble in Nonidet, and the innermost layer is a glycoprotein coat surrounding the nucleic acid core. Prot,ein 1, which constikkes only about, l? of the total viral protein, may be associated with either the nucleic acid core or with the coat surrounding the core. Comparison of the protein composition of TSWV with that of ot.her membrane-bound viruses (Table 2) shows that, TSWV cannot8 be grouped with anv of them on the basis of protein composi&on. Htnce the classification of TSWV into a monotypic group (Harrison et al., 1971) can be just,ified.\n\nVirus-induced prot,eins have been succcssfully demonstrated in TAN-infected tissue using double-labeling techniques and PAGE (Zaitlin and Hariharasubramanian, 1973; Singer, 1971) . However, in TSWV-infected leaf Cssue, the synthesis of only one protein (corresponding to structural protein no. 3) was detected. This is surprising as TSWV particles are composed of three major proteins in roughly equal proportions (Table 1) . As these experiments were done with t,wo amino acids, leucine and valine, both of which have been shown to be consbituenk of TSWV protein (Jennings and Best, 1964) , it is unlikely that they are incorporated into only one prot,ein and not, into the other structural prot,eins. One possible explanation for these results is that greater quantities of prot,ein 3 are synthesized than are incorporated int,o the viral particle."}
