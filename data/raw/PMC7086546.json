{"title": "Nitazoxanide May Modify the Course of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy", "body": "The JCV VP1 peptide pool assay (PepTivator\u00ae, Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany)) was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. In brief, thawed peripheral blood mononuclear cells were either rested (negative control), stimulated with 10 \u03bcl of PepTivator\u00ae stock solution (VP1), or stimulated with PMA and ionomycin (PMA), each for six hours with addition of Brefeldin A after two hours. Harvested cells were then stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, fixated and permeabilized and intracellularly stained with anti IFN\u03b3 or TNF\u03b1 (Biolegend, San Diego, USA) as previously described [5]. VP1 stimulation was calculated by subtracting the negative control values from the VP1-stimulated values."}
