{"title": "Impact of infectious diseases on population health using incidence-based disability-adjusted life years (DALYs): results from the Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe study, European Union and European Economic Area countries, 2009 to 2013", "body": "Countries of the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) increasingly face the challenge of how best to allocate limited resources for infectious disease prevention and control. Evidence to determine priorities is often limited and epidemiological data may be unavailable, of uncertain quality or difficult to communicate to decision makers. Burden of disease estimates, using composite health measures, provide clear and comprehensive information for transparent and accountable decision making and have the potential to play an important role in health policy formulation [1]. Numerous studies have addressed the challenge of estimating disease burden regionally, nationally and globally [2-8].\n\nIn high-income countries, the incidence of infectious diseases has decreased over the last century, but recent outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging diseases worldwide, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), measles, avian and pandemic influenza, chikungunya virus, Ebola virus disease (EVD) and Zika virus disease, have resulted in a renewed focus on infectious diseases [9-14]. In addition, the traditional boundaries between non-infectious diseases and infectious diseases have become blurred as increasing evidence of the aetiological role of the latter in triggering non-infectious conditions is available [15,16].\n\nIn 2006, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) commissioned a pilot disease burden study using seven selected infectious diseases in order to propose a methodology for a burden of disease study tailored towards infectious diseases and assess the feasibility of, and interest in, such an approach [17]. Based on this pilot, the Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe (BCoDE) project was launched [18], funded by ECDC and implemented in collaboration with a European consortium led by the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and consisting of academic and national health institutes from EU countries.\n\nThe main objective of the BCoDE project was to develop a methodology to assess the impact of infectious diseases on population health in EU/EEA countries. It also intended to promote an evidence-based approach to assess population health, foster analysis of surveillance data quality and availability, facilitate the communication of complex health information to decision makers, and provide a tool for the planning and prioritisation of infectious disease prevention, preparedness and control measures.\n\nTo achieve these objectives, a methodology was developed [19,20] that uses a composite health measure, the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) [21], to express the disease burden of an infectious disease in a single metric and is therefore suitable for comparing their relative burden.\n\nIn line with the overall objectives of the BCoDE project, the specific aim of the BCoDE 2009\u20132013 study described in this paper was to provide a baseline average annual estimate of the EU/EEA burden of selected infectious diseases surveyed by ECDC and measured in DALYs.\n\nThe methodological framework of the BCoDE 2009\u20132013 study was based on the BCoDE project [19,20]. This methodology uses an incidence-based approach with a disease progression pathway to estimate DALYs, an outcome measure that describes the impact of years lived with disability (YLD) following the onset of a disease and of years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLL) compared with a standardised life expectancy [22]. The incidence-based approach acknowledges current and future sequelae of infections, and sets the baseline for estimating the impact of prevention and control interventions. The disease progression model (i.e. outcome tree) links possible sequelae to an initial infection and allocates that future burden to the time of infection.\n\nTo calculate DALYs, the incidence of acute, symptomatic disease is a key input variable. Besides the number of symptomatic infections, computation of DALYs requires several additional age group and sex-specific variables. These variables include the risk of developing short- and long-term complications (health outcomes), their duration, and weights reflecting their severity. These variables are described through disease models or outcome trees, which represent the progression of a disease over time by ordering relevant health outcomes following infection and illustrating their conditional dependency [19,20].\n\nTo determine the life expectancy at age of death, we used the same standard reference life table as the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010) [23]. Disability weights were selected from the set developed by the European disability weight project [24]. Outcome trees, their parameters and literature reviews for each disease included in this study are described in the BCoDE toolkit, version 1.2 [25] and are available in Supplement 1. No age-weighting and time-discounting was applied.\n\nDiseases for inclusion in the present BCoDE 2009\u20132013 study were selected from those listed in Decision 2119/98/EC with amendments, which fall under the mandate of ECDC as part of its responsibilities for epidemiological surveillance in support of the identification, assessment and communication of threats to health due to communicable diseases in the EU/EEA countries [26]. The selection criteria were data availability, incidence, outbreak potential and whether the disease is preventable with widely used vaccines (Supplement 2). Final disease selections were made by an ad hoc working group of the ECDC Advisory Forum, a board of experts from EU/EEA countries advising the ECDC Director [27].\n\nResults represent the burden of infectious diseases in all of the EU/EEA countries, except for Croatia, which joined the EU in 2012. However, due to the wide variability of data availability and/or quality across countries and in order to balance data quality and representativeness, for some diseases the estimation was based on a subset of countries. Details are available in Supplement 3. Reasons for excluding countries included data availability (e.g. countries not reporting surveillance data to ECDC) and data completeness (e.g. countries reporting only aggregate or sentinel-based surveillance data but with the denominator population being unreported or unknown). Age group and sex-specific demographic data were obtained from the Eurostat database, 2011 [28].\n\nCases of diseases notified to ECDC through The European Surveillance System (TESSy), a database of communicable diseases cases in EU/EEA countries, were used as the main data source for estimating incidence of acute infections. In order to remove the effect of large fluctuations in incidence data, for example that because of seasonality of disease or outbreaks, notified cases during five years, 2009 to 2013, were averaged to obtain an annual notified number of incident cases.\n\nThe annual number of cases was estimated in a step-wise approach, generally by multiplying the age group and sex-specific number of cases notified to ECDC by a multiplication factor adjusting for underestimation [29]. For full details see Supplement 3 and Table 1. In order to determine the most suitable multiplication factors, we reviewed the available TESSy data.\n\nThe first step involved determining the availability of notification data: which countries reported and for which years. Countries not reporting or reporting limited information on sex and age of cases data were excluded from the study. The second step involved reviewing annual notification rates separately for each country, and the third step involved comparing the average rates across different countries. During these steps, together with ECDC surveillance experts, we considered surveillance systems\u2019 characteristics, including case definition, case-based vs aggregate reporting, compulsory vs voluntary reporting, comprehensive vs sentinel surveillance and whether or not the surveillance system had national coverage. Notification rates were also reviewed in relation to epidemiological circumstances (e.g. outbreaks and disease exposure), reporting practices, healthcare providers\u2019 awareness, and healthcare system characteristics.\n\nFor a number of diseases, i.e. campylobacteriosis, chlamydia infection, congenital toxoplasmosis, influenza, pertussis and salmonellosis, it was concluded that it was not possible to estimate the incidence from notified data and alternative methods were applied (see Supplement 3). In particular, no published large community study was found for influenza except for the results of the Flu Watch cohort study in the United Kingdom [30], which we chose as the main data source to model the incidence of influenza in EU/EEA countries.\n\nAll the approaches above were explored in order to estimate the incidence of acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the general population. However, only published serological studies based on limited populations at risk were found, which would have introduced an unmeasurable bias and uncertainty and would not have allowed to estimate the incidence in the total population. Therefore, we excluded HCV infection from our disease burden estimation as no reliable data on the annual incidence of acute HCV was identified.\n\nFor each disease, a model was generated using the BCoDE toolkit. Within each model, the age group-specific and sex-specific annual number of cases, multiplication factors adjusting for underestimation and population were inserted in the software. Uncertainty intervals (UI) were expressed as Uniform (2 values) or Project Evaluation and Review Techniques (PERT) (3 values) distributions; we ran the models at 10,000 iterations of the Monte Carlo simulations, without time discounting and age-weighting. For each disease, results included DALYs per case and the following per 100,000 population: incidence, deaths, YLL, YLD and DALYs. For all the outputs, we showed the median and the 95% UI.\n\nThe BCoDE 2009\u20132013 study used a combination of aggregate health information (i.e. without personal identifiers) notified to ECDC through TESSy and information stemming from the scientific literature; therefore, informed consent was not required. Other information included in the study was drawn from published literature.\n\nIn terms of burden of congenital infections in the newborns, almost all the burden (97%) was attributable to toxoplasmosis, listeriosis and rubella infections (Table 3).\n\nThe diseases with the highest number of DALYs per case, which represents the individual burden and to a certain extent the severity of the disease, were rabies and variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease, which are ultimately fatal conditions. HIV/AIDS, invasive meningococcal disease, listeriosis, TB, IHID, Legionnaires\u2019 disease, HBV infection, IPD, congenital toxoplasmosis, tetanus and diphtheria followed, with DALYs per case ranging from 6.03 to 1.16. Diseases determined to have a high individual and population burden were Legionnaires\u2019 disease, IPD, HIV/AIDS and TB, while influenza was determined to have a low individual but high population burden (Figure 4).\n\nMost DALYs, around 60%, were due to infections occurring in males. Considering more detailed results presented in Supplement 4, diseases such as TB, HIV/AIDS, Legionnaires\u2019 disease, were found to impact mostly men while chlamydia and gonorrhoea had a higher burden in women.\n\nWhen considering DALYs over the total population, 11% occurred in children less than 5 years of age, 15% in individuals less than 15 years of age and 24% in individuals aged 65 years and over (see Supplement 4); most DALYs were found in age groups between 25 and 49 year of age (Figure 5). However, when considering the age group-specific DALYs per 100,000 population of the age group, those with the highest overall burden were infants under one year of age and individuals 80 years of age and over (Figure 6).\n\nCompared with the age groups of between 15 and 64 years of age (adults) and 65 years of age and over (elderly population), the total burden of disease in the population under 15 years of age is lower (Figure 7). The diseases with the highest burden in the under 15 years age group are HBV infection, influenza, IHID, IPD and invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). HIV/AIDS, TB and influenza are the diseases with the highest burden in the adult population, whereas influenza, IPD and TB have the highest impact in the elderly population.\n\nThe acute phase of diseases had the highest impact on the total burden (76%) (see Supplement 4). This was the result of the outcome trees that modelled case fatality proportions (CFP) as a direct risk to the acute infection. The high share of YLLs (72% of total DALYs, see Table 2) compared with YLDs was due to the limited amount of time lived with a disability, which is typical for infectious diseases.\n\nThe final ranking of the burden of disease gives a new picture of the impact of infectious diseases when compared with notification data (Figure 8).\n\nOne strength of our study is that it is based on a rigorous assessment of national surveillance systems, which provided important information on sensitivity; where possible, notified data for a disease was adjusted specifically for each country. For example, country multiplication factors based on a self-reported survey of the national sensitivity towards IPD surveillance [50] were applied to the notification data and DALYs were estimated using the resulting cumulative number of cases. In other instances, such as for Legionnaires\u2019 disease, countries were grouped according to ECDC disease programme expert opinion into higher, intermediate and lower surveillance system sensitivity and different multiplication factors were then applied for each sensitivity group. The sensitivity of surveillance systems does not only depend on their intrinsic characteristics; systems are also prone to temporary changes, for example, during outbreaks, when increased awareness might also increase willingness and capacity to detect and report cases. For the estimation of the incidence of measles, for example, notification of cases from countries and years experiencing an outbreak were adjusted with a multiplication factor of 1.5 [51], as opposed to 2.5 for other countries and years [52,53].\n\nAnother strength of this study is that it captures the different risks of developing sequelae or death according to age group. Examples include the age group-specific risk of developing HUS after STEC/VTEC infection, a crucial step towards the estimation of its burden, and the redistribution of the CFP of salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis and influenza according to observed age-specific mortality data in order not to overestimate the number of deaths in younger age groups [25].\n\nDisability weights included in the disease models are derived from a study performed in Europe and thus have the potential to better reflect the preferences and values of the EU/EEA population [24]. Most infectious diseases cause temporary mild disabilities; it is important to note that according to the methodology used to estimate disability weights, these may differ substantially for similar health states [54].\n\nA further strength is that the freely accessible and transparent methodology, parameters and variables of this study allow for reproducing the estimates and making comparisons with results from similar studies. For example, the burden of infectious diseases in the Netherlands is a national study that was based on the BCoDE project methodology with national adaptations [5].\n\nA number of limitations need to be taken into account when interpreting the results of this study. First, the selection of diseases was limited to those included in Decision 2119/98/EC with amendments. This list does not include other infectious diseases with a potentially significant burden in EU/EEA countries, such as infections with human papillomavirus (HPV), Helicobacter pylori, rotavirus, norovirus and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV).\n\nSecond, multiplication factors adjusting for underestimation of notified data were selected from information found in the literature. Few country-specific multiplication factors were available and ranges based on the limited number of published studies were applied consistently across EU/EEA countries. Moreover, multiplication factors were not adjusted for different age groups, although some diseases causing diarrhoea, such as salmonellosis for instance, had high notification rates in children. This may be due to a testing bias, i.e. children may be tested more often, or to their reduced immunity or to higher exposure. Regardless of the reason, This means that there is a risk that the results may be underestimated or overestimated.\n\nThird, the disease models (outcome trees) in the BCoDE toolkit are based on several assumptions [55]. Variables for each model parameter represent the available information in the literature and the age-specific risk of developing a certain sequelae or death was often not available. Outcome trees were developed considering the incidence of disease and the risks of developing sequelae as currently observed in EU/EEA countries. Therefore, treatment and preventive measures were implicitly considered and this should be taken into account when interpreting the results. For example, vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) with high coverage had a lower burden of disease, but they had the potential to substantially increase their burden and their resulting position in the final ranking during outbreaks. In addition, the disease models included in this study are static and do not consider future infection transmissions. Dynamic models, such as SIR compartmental models for infection transmission, should be developed when assessing the impact of prevention and control interventions.\n\nFourth, the probability of developing sequelae or death were estimated based on the limited information in the literature, except in some cases where information was derived from surveillance data (Supplement 1), and considered the competing risks of dying or developing complications to the extent possible. At older ages, for example, co-morbidities may worsen the severity of a given infectious disease, suggesting modification of disability weights or the need to consider the attributable fraction due to the infections as opposed to the other underlying condition.\n\nFifth, the burden of HBV was based on the average annual number of acute infections but like other long-term disease progression pathways, other subsequent stages of the disease have an impact on population health. It would be beneficial to complement the incidence-based HBV results with prevalence studies given that our burden of HBV estimates do not consider prevalent long-term complicated cases.\n\nThe methodology and results in this study are based on a fully transparent and reproducible approach. We believe that the burden of disease methodology described in this study provides a clear and comprehensive view on the impact of infectious diseases on population health.\n\nCalculation of DALYs through incidence-based disease progression models represents a comprehensive approach suitable for infectious diseases and provides useful information for prioritisation and planning in public health, among other purposes. For example, a recent Scientific Opinion by the European Food Safety Authority recommended using the BCoDE approach for ranking risks [56]. Another example is the Slovenian national estimation of the burden of tick-borne encephalitis that identified age groups with the highest DALYs in order to inform vaccination strategies [57].\n\nHowever, as quantitative results alone might not fully encompass all unknowns, uncertainties and variability [58] other dimensions of health should be considered. Burden of disease measured in DALYs could be integrated with risk-ranking methodologies such as multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA).\n\nThat being said, this study provides useful information for planning and prioritising surveillance strategies and intervention options aimed at preventing and controlling infectious diseases as the estimates provide a useful picture of the impact of infectious diseases in EU/EEA countries. The findings will help to inform assessment of the impact of epidemics and of public health interventions."}
