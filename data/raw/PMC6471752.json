{"title": "Particulate air pollution on cardiovascular mortality in the tropics: impact on the elderly", "body": "Air pollution has a significant health impact on mortality and morbidity worldwide, resulting in an estimated 4.2 million deaths and 103.1 million disability\u2013adjusted life-years lost [1]. Air pollution has wide-ranging systemic effects on the human body, impacting both the respiratory, and cardiovascular systems via multiple mechanisms including oxidative stress, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction [2].\n\nMany prospective cohort and daily time-series studies published globally have consistently demonstrated the negative associations between long and short-term exposure to air pollution and human health [3\u20139]. These studies did not only establish associations between ambient particulate matters and respiratory health, but also on cardiovascular health, with the elderly being an especially susceptible group [10\u201312]. However, the vast majority of these studies were conducted in temperate regions [3\u20139] rather than in the tropics. As seasonal variations and temperature changes have been shown to impact the relationship of air pollution on health outcomes [13\u201315], we aim to study the impact of air pollution on non-accidental and cardiovascular mortality in the general population, as well as the elderly, in an equatorial country with tropical climate and no seasons.\n\nSingapore is an Asian city-state, situated near the equator with a tropical climate, comprising 5.40 million of people. Besides being exposed to daily ambient air pollution generated from domestic sources, Singapore is also exposed almost yearly to haze episodes of about a month long duration, whereby smoke from regional forest fires especially during the dry seasons is blown by winds from neighbouring countries [16].\n\nAir pollutant and meteorological data are comprehensively collected in Singapore. Daily average of 24-h concentrations for particulate matters smaller than 10 \u03bcm and 2.5 \u03bcm (PM10 and PM2.5), 8-h carbon monoxide (CO), 24-h nitrogen dioxide (NO2), 8-h ozone (O3) and 24-h sulphur dioxide (SO2) from the years of 2001 to 2013 were obtained from the National Environment Agency (NEA) Singapore. During this 13-year study period, air pollution in Singapore was monitored in air monitoring stations located at various sites around Singapore. Four stations located at road-sides were excluded from the study because they did not reflect the daily exposure to air pollutants amongst the general population. Our final analysis included data from 18 studied stations and data completeness for each studied station was assessed by calculating the proportion of days on which data was collected out of the number of days in operation. Aggregated daily air pollutant concentrations were calculated following the Air Pollution on Health: European Approach (APHEA) protocol with added modifications [13]. In summary, imputed annual mean concentrations for each station were subtracted from the station-specific daily concentrations of the same year to generate a set of \u2018centred\u2019 values. Using the centred values, the arithmetic mean was calculated across all stations by day and the average of the imputed annual mean concentrations were then added back to derive the daily values used in the analysis. Average meteorological values were derived from daily means of dry bulb temperature and relative humidity from 5 stations which selected based on the shortest proximity to the air monitoring stations provided by NEA\u2019s Meteorological Service division.\n\nMortality data from the Registry of Births & Deaths were extracted to calculate aggregated daily counts of all non-accidental deaths (International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9000\u2013799 from the period of 2001\u20132012 & ICD-10 A00-R99 for the year of 2013) and cardiovascular deaths (ICD-9390\u2013459 & ICD-10 I00-I99) by age groups (all-age, < 65 and \u2265 65 years) over the 13 years study period. A separate analysis was also conducted looking at the subset of subjects \u2265 80 years. Ethics approval was obtained from the SingHealth Centralised Institutional Review Board.\n\nA quasi-Poisson generalized additive model was used for the analysis [17]. Single-day lag models and distributed lag models (DLMs) were respectively built to analyse the lagged day effects of the different air pollutants first on all ages combined non-accidental and cardiovascular mortality [18\u201320] respectively. Analyses of PM10 and PM2.5 effects stratified by two age groups (< 65 and \u2265 65 years) were then repeated using the DLMs to further study age-specific effects.\n\nSeparate core models were firstly built (for each age group and mortality type) without adding pollutant variable to explain the variations, as much as possible, due to long term trends and other potential time-varying confounding factors:\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ Log\\ E\\left[(Y)\\right]=\\alpha +s(T)+{\\beta}_1 DOW+{\\beta}_2 SARS+{\\beta}_3 FLU+{\\beta}_4 PH+{\\beta}_5 afterPH+s(DBT)+s(RH) $$\\end{document}LogEY=\u03b1+sT+\u03b21DOW+\u03b22SARS+\u03b23FLU+\u03b24PH+\u03b25afterPH+sDBT+sRH\n\nWhere Log is the natural logarithm, Y is the daily counts of non-accidental or cardiovascular deaths, DOW refers to the day of week and s(T), s(DBT) and s(RH) refer to the penalised cubic regression smoothers for long term trends, dry bulb temperature (\u00b0C) and relative humidity (%) respectively. 1 to 3 days lag were tested for variables DBT and RH. Selection of lag-day variables and smoothing spline parameters were based on models giving the lowest quasi-Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion [21]. Dummy variables of SARS and FLU are used to control for impact due to the periods of 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemics respectively while PH and afterPH are terms for public holidays and the day following public holidays.\n\nAfter the core model was established and chosen for each mortality outcome, variables depicting the various air pollutants were added for the single-day lag models. Two-pollutant models were further constructed for pollutants with significant effects in the single pollutant model. For the DLMs, basis functions were applied with the lag-response relationship defined a priori using a 3rd degree polynomial. Polynomials had been used in previous air pollution studies to analyse the lag-response associations [22\u201324]. A 30-day lag structure, signifying a medium-term period of about a month, was used to observe cumulative effects and mortality displacement if any. As a sensitivity analysis, cumulative lag-response charts generated with DLMs using 2nd and 4th degrees polynomials are shown in the Additional file 1: Figures S1 to S4. Percentage changes in mortality risk, or excess risks (ERs), associated with a 0.1 mg/m3 for CO and 10 \u03bcg/m3 for other pollutants were calculated using (RR-1) \u00d7 100%, where RR denotes relative risk estimated from the regression coefficient of air pollutant variable of the models. Statistical significance was assessed using 95% confidence intervals (CI). Residual autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) charts for the core models were performed to assess model fit and are shown in Additional file 1: Figure S5. Data collection process might be interrupted for certain stations over the study period due to site relocation or site closure, and hence annual mean pollutant concentrations used for centring the data were imputed using spatial interpolation with the \u201cfields\u201d package version 8.3\u20136 in the R statistical software [25]. All statistical analyses, including plotting of lag-response relationships and residual diagnostics to assess model fit, were carried out using the \u201cmgcv\u201d and \u201cdlnm\u201d packages in R version 3.3.1 [17, 19, 26].\n\nThe low residual ACF and PACF values (Additional file 1: Figure S5) showed that the core models were able to explain the temporal trends of the data adequately. Significant effects were observed for PM10 & PM2.5 in both the single-day and distributed lag models. In the single-day lag models, the highest ER associated with a 10 \u03bcg/m3 increase occurred in the 3rd day after exposure for both non-accidental (PM10 ER: 0.627, 95% CI: 0.260\u20130.995% and PM2.5 ER: 0.660%; 95% CI: 0.204\u20131.118%) and cardiovascular mortality (PM10 ER: 0.897%; 95% CI: 0.283\u20131.516% and PM2.5 ER: 0.883%; 95% CI: 0.121\u20131.621%). The estimated ERs generally remained significant for PM10 and PM2.5 even after controlling for additional pollutants (Additional file 1: Table S2a,b).\n\nO3 also exhibited a significant effect at day 1 lag for non-accidental mortality (ER: 0.354%; 95% CI: 0.011\u20130.698%). However, this effect was insignificant after adjusting for PM10 and PM2.5 (Additional file 1: Table S2c). Effects by other pollutants were observed to be minimal or insignificant (Table 2).\n\nResults from the distributed lag models are presented in Table 3 and Fig. 1. Significant cumulative effects were observed over days 0\u20135 but not over subsequent longer periods. Cumulative ERs over days 0\u20135 for PM10 & PM2.5 were estimated to be 0.700% (95% CI: 0.276\u20131.126%) & 0.829% (0.276\u20131.386%) respectively for non-accidental [30] mortality, and 0.921% (0.218\u20131.629%) & 1.073% (0.157\u20131.998%) respectively for cardiovascular mortality. Sensitivity analysis using 2nd or 4th degree polynomials showed similar results (Additional file 1: Figures S1-S4).\n\nCumulative effects were significant in the elderly aged 65 years old and above, with every 10 \u03bcg/m3 increase in pollutant concentration resulting in a 0.771% (95% CI: 0.265\u20131.279%) and a 0.955% (0.297\u20131.618%) increase over days 0\u20135 in non-accidental mortality risk for PM10 & PM2.5 respectively. Cardiovascular mortality in turn showed a 1.236% (0.436\u20132.042%) and a 1.478% (0.437\u20132.530%) increase in risk of PM10 & PM2.5 over days 0\u20135 (Table 4).\n\nNo significant effects were seen over days 0\u201315, but interestingly significant negative cumulative effects were seen for cardiovascular mortality over days 0\u201330 in the elderly group (PM10 ER: -2.085%; 95% CI: -3.614% \u2013 -0.532% and PM2.5 ER: -2.721%; 95% CI: -4.667% \u2013 -0.736%). A similar negative effect was also seen for the younger age group for non-accidental mortality over days 0\u201330 for PM2.5 (ER:-1.694%; 95% CI: -3.220% \u2013 -0.143%). Sensitivity analysis using up to 2nd or 4th degree of polynomials showed similar results (Additional file 1: Figures S1-S4).\n\nIn a separate analysis looking at the very elderly aged 80 years and above, cumulative effects were significant, with every 10 \u03bcg/m3 increase in pollutant concentration resulting in a 0.749% (95% CI: 0.095\u20131.408%) and a 0.955% (0.105\u20131.812%) increase over days 0\u20135 in non-accidental mortality risk for PM10 & PM2.5 respectively (data not shown). There was a trend towards increased cardiovascular mortality at days 0\u20135, although this association was not significant. Significant negative cumulative effects were seen for cardiovascular mortality over days 0\u201330 in this very elderly group for PM10 (ER: -2.060%; 95% CI: -3.987% \u2013 -0.094%) and a similar non-signficant trend for PM2.5.\n\nGraphs showing non-cumulative percentage change in mortality over days 0\u201330 are shown in the Additional file 1: Figure S6, S7. The graphs for the all-age group and the \u2265 65 years age group showed that impact on mortality was mostly observed in the immediate days (days 0\u20135) after exposure. After this initial period, significant protective effects were actually observed in both non-accidental & cardiovascular mortality. However, while non-accidental mortality showed effects approaching the null around days 15\u201320, cardiovascular mortality only showed a rebound around days 20\u201325, thus indicating a slower approach.\n\nThere are several limitations. Firstly, due to the time-series analysis nature of the study, unmeasured clinical variables (eg. comorbidities), which could affect the actual estimates of air pollution on mortality, could not be fully accounted for despite our best efforts in controlling for potential confounding factors in the models. Our models also did not adjust for the transboundary haze episodes as we wanted to analyse the general exposure of the public to air pollutants, and not to distinguish between domestic and transboundary air pollution. Secondly, the impact of indoor air pollution was not assessed as this data was not readily available, but we believe such effect would be minimal as residents in Singapore do not burn coals for cooking in the houses. Thirdly, a 3rd degree of polynomials was used to define the lag-response relationship over a period of 30 days. A different parametric shape or a different degree parameter would result in different ER estimates. However, a sensitivity analysis using up to 2nd or 4th degree of polynomials showed that these differences were minute and did not affect our final interpretation. A fourth limitation is that we did not explore the inclusion of different concentration-response functions to describe the exposure-response relationship [35]. In our analysis, we assumed a log-linear relationship via a quasi-Poisson model. Lastly, correlation between the paired pollutants in the two-pollutant models potentially resulted in multicollinearity that produced some unstable estimates.\n\nThese first contemporary population-based data from an equatorial country with tropical climate and no seasons show that exposure to particulate air pollution (PM2.5, PM10) was significantly associated with non-accidental mortality and cardiovascular mortality, especially in the elderly."}
