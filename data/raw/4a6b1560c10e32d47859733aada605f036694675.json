Collecting blood and sputum samples in every patient with CAP is controversial, because there is no clear benefit to establishing the causative agent in CAP. 8. The most common CAP pathogens are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella species. 9. Presenting features of CAP do not predict the causative agent. 10. Approximately 20% of S. pneumoniae are penicillin-resistant and one third are macrolide-resistant. Fluoroquinolone resistance is low in the United States. 11. Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or fluoroquinolone monotherapy as empiric treatment for patients with CAP admitted to the general medical ward. 12. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit should receive coverage for S. pneumoniae, Legionella, and possibly Pseudomonas. 13. The optimum duration of antibiotic administration is unknown (7-10 days is reasonable in most cases). 14. Even with appropriate antibiotic use, fevers may take up to 72 hours to fully resolve. Persistent fevers or declining clinical status should prompt an evaluation for complications or worsening pneumonia. 15. Pulmonary infiltrates can take weeks or months to fully resolve following treatment. 16. Aspiration pneumonitis does not usually require antibiotic therapy unless the patient is at risk for bacterial colonization of the gastric contents or Community-Acquired Pneumonia the symptoms do not resolve within 48 hours of the event. 17. Therapy for aspiration pneumonia includes a swallowing evaluation and antibiotics with activity against gramnegative bacteria. Anaerobic coverage is appropriate in some settings (e.g., a lung abscess or severe periodontal disease). 18. Preventive measures against CAP include smoking cessation and administration of the polysaccharide pneumococcal and inactivated influenza vaccines. \n\nAn estimated 4 million cases of communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) occur annually in the United States, accounting for at least 600,000 hospital admissions. CAP is the sixth leading cause of death. The mortality rate for hospitalized CAP patients is approximately 1 in 10 but this rate is higher in specific populations (e.g., nursing home residents) and approaches 40% in the severely ill who require admission to the intensive care unit.\n\nCommunity-Acquired Pneumonia\n\nAspiration pneumonia accounts for up to 15% of CAP cases and is common among nursing home residents. The risk of aspiration pneumonia is higher in the elderly and patients with dysphagia, stroke, or critical illness and lower in patients without teeth. Usually, the episode of aspiration is not witnessed; the diagnosis is inferred when patients at risk for aspiration present with an infiltrate in a characteristic pulmonary location (posterior upper lobe or apical lower lobe segments from recumbent aspiration, and basal lower lobe segments from upright or semirecumbent aspiration). Patients with aspiration pneumonia have clinical features similar to those of patients with CAP but have a higher incidence of pulmonary cavitation and abscess formation.\n\nEarly studies identified anaerobic organisms as the predominant pathogens in patients with aspiration pneumonia, but this has not been confirmed in recent studies.\n\nAspiration pneumonitis occurs in patients with altered consciousness (e.g., seizures, drug overdose, and anesthesia). The aspirated gastric contents are usually sterile but the acidity burns the lung, causing an intense inflammatory reaction. Bacterial infection may subsequently develop, but the prevalence of this complication is unknown. Infection likely plays some role if the gastric contents are colonized with pathogenic organisms (e.g., gastroparesis, enteral feedings, and ant-acid therapy raise the gastric pH and increase the risk of bacterial colonization).\n\nAspiration pneumonitis has a broad spectrum of presentation, ranging from cough or wheeze to cyanosis, shortness of breath, hypoxemia, hypotension, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death.\n\nMost cases of CAP are limited to a few key organisms (Box 13-1), although in most cases the cause of the pneumonia is not identified. S. pneumoniae (pneumococcus) accounts for approximately two thirds of all cases of bacteremic pneumonia. Other common pathogens include M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and Legionella species, which have been reported to cause ''atypical'' pneumonia (pneumonia that does not present with classic signs and symptoms). In the past, the presenting signs and symptoms of pneumonia were thought to predict the causative agent, but we now know this to be untrue-there is a wide spectrum of presentation for each organism that is known to cause CAP, and these pathogens cannot be distinguished based only on symptoms, clinical signs, and findings on chest x-ray.\n\nImmunocompetent adults presenting with pneumonia may have fever ($ 80%), cough (> 90%), sputum production ($ 66%), dyspnea ($ 66%), and pleuritic chest pain ($ 50%). However, these symptoms may also occur in patients with bronchitis or upper respiratory tract infections. Therefore, symptoms at presentation do not reliably distinguish between CAP and other respiratory illnesses. Bronchitis and upper respiratory tract infections are usually caused by viruses and can almost always be differentiated from pneumonia using chest x-ray. One caveat is that the chest x-ray may be normal in patients with CAP who are dehydrated. In this setting, the infiltrate should become visible following adequate hydration.\n\nExtrapulmonary symptoms, including gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, myalgias, and arthralgias, occur in up to one third of CAP patients.\n\nPhysical exam findings depend on the severity of the infection. The patient may have fever, tachypnea, hypoxemia, pulmonary crackles, bronchial breath sounds, and respiratory distress with accessory respiratory muscle use.\n\nInitial laboratory testing for patients with CAP requiring hospital admission should include:\n\nCommunity-Acquired Pneumonia 1. Complete blood count (with differential) and chemistry panel, including assessment of renal function and glucose 2. Blood cultures (controversial; see following text) 3. PA and lateral chest x-ray, which may show a lobar (occurring in one lobe of the lung) or segmental pulmonary infiltrate, patchy or diffuse lung infiltrates, or pleural effusion. The ''air bronchogram sign'' occurs when dense lung consolidation delineates air in the intrapulmonary bronchi, which are not normally visualized on chest x-ray. This sign confirms the presence of lung consolidation. The chest x-ray is also useful for ruling out complications, such as pneumothorax, abscesses, and empyema. 4. Sputum for gram stain and culture from a deep cough (controversial; see following text).\n\nIf appropriate, also test the sputum for tuberculosis, Legionella, fungi, and viruses. 5. Assessment of arterial oxygenation (arterial blood gas or pulse oximetry) 6. Thoracentesis to rule out empyema if there is an effusion measuring > 10 mm on lateral decubitus chest x-ray\n\nOther tests that may be appropriate (depending on the clinical circumstances) include:\n\n1. Urine antigen assay for L. pneumoniae serogroup 1. This test is appropriate for (a) hospitalized patients with an unusual presentation of pneumonia, (b) patients with an unusual pneumonia admitted to the intensive care unit during a Legionella epidemic, and (c) patients who fail to respond to a beta-lactam antibiotic. 2. Urine antigen assay for S. pneumoniae. This test can be used as an adjunct to blood and sputum cultures, with the potential advantage of a rapid turnaround time.\n\nThere is no well-documented benefit for establishing the causative agent in CAP. Therefore, collection of blood and sputum samples in all CAP patients is controversial. Sputum samples are also limited by the ability of the patient to produce a good specimen and the experience of the person interpreting the Gram stain. Nonetheless, these samples may be useful for directing therapy if the patient fails to respond to empiric treatment. Ideally, sputum and blood samples should be collected prior to antibiotic administration, but antibiotic therapy should never be delayed because early treatment is important for the outcome of CAP.\n\nIf you are on the inpatient medicine service, this decision has already been made. However, you may be involved in the decision-making process during a rotation through the emergency department or if you see a patient with CAP in clinic. Recognized risk factors for increased mortality in CAP include advanced age and comorbidities, such as cancer and heart failure. The decision to admit relies on clinical judgment, although there are also prognostic scoring rules that can support this decision. The most widely used and rigorously studied prediction rule is the Pneumonia PORT (Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team) Severity Index (PSI), which stratifies patients into one of five categories using a point system based on several variables at the time of presentation (Fig. 13-1 ). An easy-to-use version is available on the internet at http://ncemi.org. The higher the score, the higher the 30-day mortality rates, the longer the length of stay, the higher the risk of admission to the intensive care unit, and the higher the risk of readmission to the hospital. The risk for \n\nAge (years) \u00c0 10 Community-Acquired Pneumonia death ranges from 0.1% to 2.8% for classes I to III, 8.2% to 9.3% for class IV, and 27% to 31% for class V. Therefore, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends home care for risk classes I to III only. Patients with low PORT scores may fail outpatient treatment because of preexisting conditions, such as social or psychiatric problems, inability to take oral medication, or acute hypoxemia. Therefore, an assessment for factors that may compromise successful outpatient therapy for CAP should occur prior to calculation of the PORT score. In other words, prediction rules might oversimplify the interpretation of important variables. Therefore, these scoring systems should not take the place of clinical judgment. \n\nThe Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends a beta-lactam plus a macrolide, or fluoroquinolone monotherapy for the empiric treatment of CAP requiring admission to the general medical ward (Table 13-1) . These regimens have been shown to reduce mortality when compared to cephalosporin monotherapy. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit with CAP should receive coverage for S. pneumoniae, Legionella, and possibly Pseudomonas (see Table 13 -1). Risk factors for Pseudomonas infection include structural lung disease (e.g., bronchiectasis) and recent hospitalization \n\nIf pseudomonas is not a concern:\n\nNo beta-lactam allergy:\n\nb-lactam plus macrolide or fluoroquinolone monotherapy Ceftriaxone 1-2 g IV q24h OR cefotaxime 2 g IV q4-8h OR ampicillin/sulbactam 1.5-3 g IV q6h OR piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g IV q6h PLUS Azithromycin 500 mg IV q24h\n\nBeta-lactam allergy: Levofloxacin 500 mg q24hAE clindamycin 600 mg IV q8h\n\nIf pseudomonas is a concern\n\nNo beta-lactam allergy:\n\n(see text)\n\nPipercillin/tazobactum 3.375 g IV q6h OR cefepime 1-2 g IV q12h AND Anti-pseudomonal agent and antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone (especially if the prior hospital stay included time in the intensive care unit).\n\nIf a causative organism is identified based on sputum or blood sample results, the empiric antibiotic regimen should be switched to a narrow spectrum agent based on susceptibilities. This practice should reduce selective pressures for bacterial resistance. The optimum duration of antibiotic administration is unknown, but most physicians treat for 7 to 10 days based on patient co-morbidities and response to treatment. With appropriate antibiotic use, fevers will trend downwards but may take up to 72 hours to fully resolve. Persistent fevers or worsening clinical status should prompt an evaluation for worsening pneumonia (repeat chest x-ray and possibly a CT scan) or complications, such as an empyema or metastatic infection (meningitis, septic arthritis, pericarditis, and peritonitis).\n\nAfter a witnessed aspiration event, the upper airway should be suctioned. Prophylactic antibiotics are frequently used but are generally not indicated (at least initially) in the majority of patients with aspiration pneumonitis because the antibiotics may select for resistant organisms in patients with uncomplicated chemical pneumonitis. Antibiotic therapy is appropriate if the aspiration pneumonitis does not resolve within 48 hours of the aspiration event or if the patient is likely to have bacterial colonization of the gastric contents (e.g., small bowel obstruction or use of antacids or proton pump inhibitors). In this setting, broad-spectrum agents are recommended. Anaerobic coverage is not routinely needed. A reasonable treatment plan is Community-Acquired Pneumonia levofloxacin 500 mg daily or intravenous ceftriaxone 1 to 2 g daily (dosages assume normal renal function). Glucocorticoids have no proven benefit.\n\nCrude assessment of the cough and gag reflexes unreliably identifies patients at risk for aspiration. Rather, a comprehensive swallowing evaluation is required (preferably a swallow study with concurrent speech therapy evaluation). A soft diet should be started if swallowing dysfunction is detected and the patient should be taught strategies to lower the risk of aspiration, such as reducing the bite size, swallowing repeatedly, and keeping the chin tucked while eating.\n\nPercutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes are no longer routinely used in patients at high-risk for aspiration, because PEG tubes have not been shown to alter mortality in this population.\n\nAntibiotics are standard of care for patients with aspiration pneumonia. Therapy should generally include activity against gram-negative organisms. Levofloxacin 500 mg daily is a reasonable treatment option (dosage assumes normal renal function). Anaerobic coverage (e.g., IV clindamycin 600 mg three times daily or metronidazole 500 mg three times daily) should be added if there is a lung abscess, necrotizing pneumonia, severe periodontal disease, or putrid sputum.\n\nThe Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends that the patient have no more than one of the following characteristics during the 24 hours preceding hospital discharge (unless this represents the patient's baseline status):\n\nCommunity-Acquired Pneumonia"}
