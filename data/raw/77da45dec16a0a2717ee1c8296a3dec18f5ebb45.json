{"title": "Bat origin of a new human coronavirus: there and back again", "body": "A novel coronavirus reported to cause pneumonia in 41 people during December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, China, was identified and designated as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) . Infection with 2019-nCoV results in clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and is associated with high mortality . This new coronavirus belongs to genus Betacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, but genetically distinct from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Up to February 4th, 2020, at least 20,630 cases have been confirmed in China and another 23 countries, with 426 deaths (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/). After epidemiological investigation, it was revealed that a local seafood market, where wild animals and live poultry were for sale, was linked to this undiagnosed pneumonia . Wu et al. collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from a patient who worked in the seafood market and performed full genome sequencing of 2019-nCoV. It was shown that 2019-nCoV had a high nucleotide sequence similarity to a bat SARS-related CoV (bat-SL-CoVZC45, accession No. MG772933) and only 79.5% genome sequence similarity to SARS-CoV. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the virus was clustered with SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoVs in subgenus Sarbecovirus Wei et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020) . Genomic analysis of 2019-nCoV and four typical coronaviruses (bat SARSr-CoV-Rp3, CoV-ZC45, CoV-ZXC21, and SARS-CoV-Tor2) showed a likelihood of recombination between 2019-nCoV and other coronaviruses among the subgenus .\n\nSo how did this novel coronavirus emerge? To investigate the origin of 2019-nCoV, Zhou et al. sequenced samples from seven patients and bats, and found that this new coronavirus shared 96.2% overall genome sequence identity with a bat coronavirus RaTG13 from horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus) ( Table 1) . This discovery provided further evidence that 2019-nCoV most likely originated from bats . Previously, horseshoe bats were identified as natural hosts for SARS-related coronaviruses which were the direct progenitors for the origin of SARS-CoV (Hu et al., 2017) . Although some amino acid residues were different in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of 2019-nCoV compared to SARS-CoV, it seems that the structure of the RBD still allowed for the use of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) as an entry receptor. It was suggested that humans were infected with the virus directly from intermediate (none-bats) hosts via contact . Certainly, more field work may be needed to find the inter-mediate hosts.\n\nSubsequent familial cluster patients implied that 2019-nCoV spreads viaperson-to-person transmission. Of six family members in Shenzhen who returned from Wuhan, five had been infected with 2019-nCoV (Chan et al., 2020) . One family member, who did not travel to Wuhan but had contact with other family members, also became infected. Similar to the beginning of the SARS-CoV pandemic, 2019-nCoV showed mild infectivity. By comparing early submitted sequences, 17 nonsynonymous changes were observed in the open reading frame 1ab, spike gene, open reading frame 7a, and open reading frame 8 . The same mutations were observed in a familial cluster, suggesting viral mutation could have occurred during person-to-person transmission. Thus, it is urgent to tightly monitor the mutation and adaptation of the virus.\n\nThe 2019-nCoV has become a major public health concern as it continues to expand and infect more people. From the available data, given that 2019-nCoV sequences are clustered into one branch with no clear phylogenetic topology , it could be inferred that there was one single introduction of the virus into the human population, likely from market animals, the so-called intermediate hosts.\n\nUsually, adaptive evolution is constantly ongoing as the virus spreads among new hosts. Emerging viruses have certain chances to become endemic or epidemic once viral amino acid changes in key regions have been fixed in the populations. Because only limited sequences were released, there is general lack of understanding of the evolution and epidemiology of the new human-infecting virus, particularly with respect to the population genetics. Thus, a timely publicity of more complete viral sequences from patients is needed (Wu and Poo, 2020) , so that scientists across different disciplines could contribute to combating the threat posed by 2019-nCoV.\n\nThe author(s) declare that they have no conflict of interest.
