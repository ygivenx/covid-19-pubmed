{"title": "Origin\nof Long-Term Storage Stability and Nitric Oxide Release Behavior of\nCarboSil Polymer Doped with S-Nitroso-N-acetyl-d-penicillamine", "body": "Blood-contacting biomedical devices ranging\nfrom simple catheters to complex extracorporeal life support systems1 are central for everyday medical care. For example,\nthe use of intravascular catheters, which enables direct vascular\naccess, is crucial for patient diagnosis and treatment. However, despite\nsubstantial efforts to better understand blood/surface interactions,\ncomplications like pulmonary embolism, stroke, and deep vein thrombosis\nare still associated with the use of indwelling blood-contacting medical\ndevices.2 In a clinical setting, a systemic\nanticoagulation agent, such as heparin, is often given to patients\nin order to reduce the risk of surface-induced thrombus formation.3 However, heparin treatment should be conducted\nwith extreme care, as an inadvertent overdose of heparin can lead\nto hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia.4 Although\nheparin preferentially binds to antithrombin (ATIII), preventing fibrin\nformation and hindering the development of the hemostatic plug, platelet\nactivation and reduced platelet count is inevitable when foreign surfaces\nare in contact with blood for a prolonged period. Moreover, biofilm-associated\ninfections are a significant cause of morbidity and death. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is the\nmost prevalent cause of the high incidence of nosocomial bloodstream\ninfections, specifically, biofilm-associated infections on indwelled\nbiomedical devices.5,6S. aureus biofilms\nform embedded matrixes which resist both antimicrobials and host defense,\nthus leading to chronic infections.7 Therefore,\nnew approaches to reduce the possibilities of these complications\nand to create truly nonthrombogenic and antimicrobial prosthetic surfaces\nare still needed within the medical community.2\n\nNitric oxide (NO), the endothelium-derived relaxing factor,\nis a gaseous signaling molecule that has been extensively studied\nover the past two decades for its role in inhibiting platelet activation\nand adhesion, preventing bacterial growth, reducing smooth cell proliferation,\nregulating complex biological processes, etc.8\u221231 The ubiquity and apparent chemical simplicity of NO have made it\na promising therapeutic agent. The production of NO can be accomplished\nthrough either enzymatic or nonenzymatic pathways.11,32 Nitric oxide either can be synthesized enzymatically by nitric oxide\nsynthase (NOS) that catalyze the conversion of l-arginine\nto l-citrulline or can be formed nonenzymatically from the\nreduction of nitrite11 or nitrosothiols.\nThe flux of NO released from a healthy endothelium lining, which constitutes\nthe inner walls of all blood vessels, has been estimated to be between\n0.5 and 4.0 \u00d7 10\u201310 mol cm\u20132 min\u20131.3,10,33,34 Therefore, a potential approach\nto increase the hemocompatibility of blood-contacting devices is to\ndevelop polymeric materials or coatings with sustained NO release\nat this physiological flux level. Indeed, it has been demonstrated\nthat surfaces capable of releasing NO at these levels can significantly\nreduce thrombus formation on the surface of implantable chemical sensors,35 intravascular catheters,14,15 as well as extracorporeal circuits (ECC).3,10,33\n\nSince NO is highly reactive under\nphysiological conditions and has a very short half-life in\nvivo,10,36 a wide range of NO donors, such\nas S-nitrosothiols (RSNO) and N-diazeniumdiolates\n(NONOate), have been used to prepare NO releasing polymeric matrixes.\nSuch NO donors have been incorporated into various polymers, including\npolyethylene glycol,37 Pluronic F127 hydrogel,12 polyurethanes,38 poly(dimethylsiloxane)\n(PDMS),9 xerogel,39 and poly(vinyl chloride),23 and these\nmaterials can provide continuous and localized NO delivery to specific\nsites of interest. S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), S-nitrosohemoglobin (SNO-Hb), and other endogenous RSNOs\nare considered NO donors in vivo. However, in recent\nyears, researchers have studied synthetic RSNOs, such as S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP).9,10,18 SNAP is a synthetic tertiary\nRSNO, and it is more stable than most endogenous primary RSNOs due\nto the steric hindrance of the sulfur atom.40,41 SNAP, like other RSNOs, can decompose and release NO via thermal\ndecomposition, metal ion catalysis (e.g., Cu+), and photolysis\nwhen the light energy corresponds with the SNAP absorption bands at\n340 nm and/or 590 nm (see eq 1 for overall reaction).10,421\n\nPrevious work by our group has suggested that SNAP is stable when\ndoped within low water uptake polymers, such as Elast-eon E2As, a\nsiloxane-base polyurethane elastomer.10 Doping SNAP into the E2As polymer using a solvent evaporation method\nproduced a homogeneous and transparent film, which exhibits relatively\nhigh stability during shelf life studies (82% of the initial SNAP\nremains after 2 months of dry storage at 37 \u00b0C).10 However, the details of the NO release mechanism from SNAP\nwithin the polymer phase and the reason SNAP is so stable in certain\npolymer materials still remains unclear.\n\nIn this study, three\ndifferent SNAP-doped biomedical grade polymers, including CarboSil\n20 80A (a thermoplastic silicone-polycarbonate-urethane with a mix\nof soft segments of poly(dimethylsiloxane) and polycarbonate as well\nas a hard segment of methylene diphenyl isocyanate (MDI)), Elast-eon\n5-325 (a copolymer of mixed soft segments of poly(dimethylsiloxane)\nand poly(hexamethylene oxide) as well as the MDI hard segment), and\nsilicone rubber (poly(dimethylsiloxane)) are investigated and further\nevaluated for their ability to store SNAP for extended periods at\n37 \u00b0C. CarboSil 20 80A possesses the innate biocompatibility\nand biostability of conventional silicone elastomers but has the processing\ncapability and toughness of thermoplastic polycarbonate-urethanes.\nTherefore, the SNAP/CarboSil system is further examined for its NO\nreleasing properties, and leaching of SNAP as well as concomitant\nNAP and NAP disulfide (NAP dimers) with time from the polymer phase\ninto the PBS soaking buffer. Raman spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction\nare utilized to conduct in situ solid-state analysis\nof the SNAP/CarboSil system to better understand the origin of the\nhigh stability and long-term NO release properties of this new composite\nmaterial. Further, catheters fabricated with SNAP-doped CarboSil polymer\nare evaluated for their efficacy in reducing microbial biofilm formation\nafter 7 days of exposure to flowing media containing S. aureus, the common bacteria that causes intravascular infections within\na drip-flow bioreactor. Finally, these NO release catheters are also\ninvestigated for their potential as antithrombotic devices via 7 h\nimplantation within the veins of rabbits.\n\nTen wt % SNAP-doped\nCarboSil films with no topcoat, 2 layers of CarboSil topcoats, and\n2 layers of SR topcoats, respectively, were fabricated (see the Supporting Information) and placed in individual\nvials containing 1 mL of 10 mM PBS, pH 7.4, with 100 \u03bcM EDTA\nto minimize trace metal catalyzed decomposition of SNAP. All films\nwere incubated in the dark at 37 \u00b0C at all times. After various\ntime points, aliquots (15 \u03bcL) of the individual soaking solutions\nwere analyzed by liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry\n(6520 Accurate-Mass Q-TOF LC/MS, Agilent Technologies, CA) for quantification\nof SNAP, NAP, and NAP disulfide present in the soaking solution. The\nstudies were conducted using a reversed-phase column (ZORBAX RRHD\nEclipse Plus C18, 2.1 \u00d7 50 mm). The gradient was obtained with\neluent A (water with 0.1% formic acid) and eluent B (95% acetonitrile,\n0.1% formic acid). After sample injection (15 \u03bcL), a linear\nchange of eluent mixtures from 100% A to 0% A over 10 min was carried\nout with a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The mass spectrometer used electrospray\nionization in the negative ion mode, and the detected species were\n[M \u2013 H]\u2212. All films were placed in fresh\nPBS buffer immediately after each measurement while the previous soaking\nsolutions were analyzed. The results were compared between films with\ndifferent topcoats. The amount of total SNAP ([SNAP]total) that had diffused into the PBS after time t was\ncalculated as follows: [SNAP]total = [SNAP]t + [NAP]t + 2 \u00d7\n[NAP disulfide]t. The amount of total\nSNAP leached into the buffer was compared with the initial amount\nSNAP in the polymer film.\n\nNitric oxide release from the polymer films\nor catheters was measured using a Sievers chemiluminescence Nitric\nOxide Analyzer (NOA) 280i (Boulder, CO). For example, a 10 wt % SNAP-doped\nCarboSil film with 2 SR topcoats was placed in the sample vial containing\n4 mL of 10 mM PBS, pH 7.4, with 100 \u03bcM EDTA at 37 \u00b0C to\nmimic the physiological conditions. Nitric oxide was continuously\ngenerated and immediately purged and swept into the chemiluminescence\ndetection chamber by N2 sweeping gas and bubbler. All films\nwere placed in fresh PBS buffer during NO release measurements and\nincubated at 37 \u00b0C in the absence of ambient light after each\nmeasurement. Cumulative NO release ([NO]total) of a given\nSNAP-doped CarboSil film after various time points was determined\nby the sum of the NO release amount in fresh PBS measured by NOA ([NO]NOA) and total amount of SNAP ([SNAP]total) leached\ninto previous soaking solutions: [NO]total = [NO]NOA + [SNAP]total. Cumulative NO release ([NO]total) was also compared with the initial amount SNAP in the polymer film.\n\nRaman spectra were collected\nby using a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope equipped with a Leica microscope,\na RenCam CCD detector, and a 633 nm laser employing an 1800 lines/nm\ngrating and a 50 \u03bcm slit. Spectra were obtained using the WiRE\n3.4 software package. Calibration was performed using a silicon standard\nin static mode. Full spectra of blank CarboSil (without SNAP), pure\nSNAP crystals, and 15 wt % SNAP-doped CarboSil were collected through\nan Olympus SLMPlan 20\u00d7 objective in extended scan mode in the\nrange of 100\u20134000 cm\u20131 and further analyzed\nby ACD/SpecManager Version 12.01 software from Advanced Chemistry\nDevelopment, Inc. For Raman mapping characterization, SNAP-doped CarboSil samples were\ncut into thin strips and laid down on the stage with the cross section\nfacing upward. Raman cross-section mapping data were obtained by using\nan Olympus SLMPlan 100\u00d7 objective in combination with an automatic\nRenishaw MS20 encoded stage in static scan mode. The exposure time\nwas 40 s with a static scan centered at 720 cm\u20131. The mapping data were analyzed using the Wire 3.4 software package\ncomponent direct classical least-squares (DCLS) analysis routines\nwith the full spectra of blank CarboSil and pure SNAP crystals as\nreferences.\n\nPowder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns of SNAP-doped (1\u201315\nwt %) and blank CarboSil films (without topcoats) were collected at\nroom temperature using a Rigaku R-Axis Spider diffractometer with\nan image plate detector and graphite monochromated Cu\u2013K\u03b1\nradiation (\u03bb = 1.54187 \u00c5) at 40 kV and 44 mA. Synthesized\nSNAP crystals were finely ground to eliminate preferred orientation,\nwhereas blank CarboSil and SNAP-doped CarboSil samples were cut into\ncubes with dimensions of approximately 250 \u03bcm. All samples were\nmounted on a CryoLoop using heavy mineral oil, and images were collected\nfor 15 min with a 0.3 mm collimator. The \u03c9-axis was oscillated\nbetween 120\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 at 1\u00b0/s, the \u03d5-axis was\nrotated at 10\u00b0/s, and the \u03c7-axis was fixed at 45\u00b0.\nThe obtained images were integrated from 2.5\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 with\na 0.1\u00b0 step size in AreaMax 2.0 software from Rigaku. All powder\npatterns were processed using Jade 9 XRD Pattern Processing, Identification\n& Quantification analysis software from Materials Data, Inc. The\nsimulated powder patterns of monoclinic and orthorhombic SNAP crystals\nwere calculated in Mercury 3.3 from the CCDC and were compared with\nthe experimental SNAP powder pattern in Jade 9. Linear least-squares\nregression for quantitation of peak area ratios versus doped-SNAP\nweight percentage was performed in MATLAB. PXRD measurements of 5\nand 15 wt % SNAP/CarboSil film (both freshly made and 10 days old\nunder ambient environment at RT) were taken and compared.\n\nThe 20 wt % SNAP-doped CarboSil\ncatheters and CarboSil control catheters employed in the in\nvitro antibiofilm and/or in vivo rabbit\nexperiments were prepared by dip-coating on 2.0 mm or 1.1 mm diameter\nstraight stainless steel mandrels (McMaster-Carr, IL). The catheters\nconsisted of SNAP-doped CarboSil inner layers and SR outer layers\non both inside and outside surfaces of the catheters. For the drip-flow\nreactor biofilm experiments (in vitro), the final\ncatheters had an i.d. of 2.0 mm and an o.d. of 4.0 mm. However, because\nof the size limitation of rabbit veins, catheters with 1.1 mm i.d.\nand 2.2 mm o.d. were fabricated for the in vivo rabbit\nexperiments. Details of the catheter fabrication procedures are reported\nin the Supporting Information file.\n\nS. aureus ATCC\n25923 was used as model strain in this study. Biofilm was developed\nonto the surfaces of control and NO release catheters for 7 days using\na drip-flow biofilm reactor (Biosurface Technologies Corp., Bozeman,\nMT).15 Details of the microbiology procedures\nused in relation to the studies reported here are provided in the Supporting Information file.\n\nFive centimeter lengths of the catheters\n(one SNAP and one control) were inserted into the jugular veins of\nrabbits for 7 h to test the hemocompability of both catheters. The\nanimal experiment details are provided in the Supporting Information file. At the end of the experiments,\nthe catheters were carefully removed from the veins, and the thrombus\nwas left intact on the catheter surface and quantitated using ImageJ\nimaging software provided by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nAll experiments were conducted in triplicate.\nData are all expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM (standard error of the mean).\nComparison of means using student\u2019s t test\nwas utilized to analyze the statistical differences between SNAP-doped\ncatheters and control catheters. Values of p <\n0.05 were considered statistically significant for all tests.\n\nThree biomedical grade polymers\n(CarboSil, E5-325, and SR) with low water uptake (see Table S1 in\nthe Supporting Information) were chosen\nas matrixes for incorporating SNAP. Ten wt % SNAP-doped polymer films\nwere prepared to evaluate their shelf life during dry storage. To\nsimulate the actual storage and/or shipping environments, the SNAP-doped\nSR, E5-325, and CarboSil films were stored in the dark with desiccant\nat 37 \u00b0C over a period of 8 months. The amount of SNAP remaining\nin different polymer films was determined at various time points to\nfind the best polymer matrix for maintaining SNAP functionality during\nstorage. The SNAP remaining in the film was decomposed through both\nthe Cu(I) mediated catalytic decomposition pathway and the photoinitiated\ndecomposition pathway by the broad-spectrum 100 W halogen light source.\nThe corresponding NO release measured by the NOA was integrated to\ndetermine the total amount of SNAP present in the polymer. The results\nindicate that SNAP is the most stable in the CarboSil polymer matrix,\nwith 88.5 \u00b1 4.3% of the initial SNAP remaining after 8 months,\ncompared to 86.8 \u00b1 4.9% in SR and 68.3 \u00b1 3.2% in E5-325\n(see Figure 1). Though\nthe conventional silicone elastomer also exhibits equivalent stability,\nits lack of processability together with the prolonged polymer curing\nprocess (for cross-linking to occur) makes CarboSil a more promising\nmaterial in terms of NO release properties.\n\nEthylene oxide sterilization is a routine\nprocedure for sterilizing clinical appliances inside hospitals, during\nwhich the devices are subjected to high temperature and high humidity\nlevel.43,44 Ten wt % of SNAP-doped SR, E5-325, and CarboSil\nwere sterilized in order to evaluate the SNAP stability in these materials\nwhen undergoing ETO sterilization. The results parallel the shelf\nlife studies, indicating that SNAP is most stable within the CarboSil\npolymer matrix. Indeed, the CarboSil films maintain 91.8 \u00b1 3.2%\nof the initial SNAP after ETO sterilization, compared to 82.7 \u00b1\n3.8% for the E5-325 films and 78.7 \u00b1 3.1% for the SR films (see Table S2). These data suggest that the SNAP-doped\nCarboSil polymer matrix is the most attractive of all formulations\nas a NO release material for fundamental studies and eventually for\npotential biomedical applications.\n\nAlthough SNAP is\nreported to be slightly hydrophobic and should preferentially stay\nwithin the polymer phase,45 some SNAP is\nlikely to diffuse from the polymer to the soaking solution. Thus, in vitro studies were conducted with SNAP-doped CarboSil\nfilms to examine the effects of different topcoat polymers by analyzing\nthe amount of total SNAP leached into the PBS during soaking. Ten\nwt % SNAP-doped CarboSil films with no topcoat, 2 layers of CarboSil\ntopcoat, and 2 layers of SR topcoat were soaked in 1 mL of PBS at\n37 \u00b0C. Although SNAP can absorb light in the UV range (see Figure\nS1 in the Supporting Information),37,42 it is not practical to quantify its decomposition species (e.g.,\nNAP and NAP disulfide) by UV\u2013Vis.37,46 Therefore, the concentrations of SNAP, NAP, and NAP disulfide in\nPBS solution buffers at each time point were monitored by LC\u2013MS.\nStandard solutions of NAP, NAP disulfide, and SNAP (1, 5, 10, 20,\n40, and 60 \u03bcM) were prepared and analyzed for the individual\nelution times and concentration\u2013peak area calibration curves\n(see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). The elution times of NAP, NAP disulfide, and SNAP from the C18 column\nare determined to be 3.45, 4.25, and 4.5 min, respectively, which\ncorrespond with the increasing log P values of three\nmolecules (\u22120.07, 0.01, and 0.40, respectively). The log P values were calculated using Marvin Sketch software, where\na higher value means greater lipophilicity and hence a longer retention\ntime. Ten wt % SNAP films initially contain ca. 450 nmol of SNAP per\nmg of polymer. When SNAP films are in contact with the soaking solutions,\nwater starts to diffuse into the polymer outer surface; SNAP begins\nto leach into the soaking buffer; and at the same time, SNAP (both\nfrom the PBS buffer and within the polymer) starts to release NO and\nform the NAP disulfide byproduct. The detection of NAP thiolate ion\nin the soaking solutions can be from two possible sources. It is known\nthat, for solid RSNO samples, contamination of thiols is likely and\nsuch thiols can react with the trace amount of Cu(II) in solution\nand form Cu(I) (eq 2).\nThen, Cu(I), acting as a catalyst, can react with RSNOs (e.g., SNAP),\nand form RS\u2013 (e.g., NAP thiolate) and Cu(II) (eq 3).47,48 Alternatively, it is conceivable that small amounts of thiolate\ncan be generated by hydrolysis of RSNOs (eq 4).48234\n\nAs shown in Figure 2a, 47% of the initial SNAP (210 nmol/mg polymer)\ndiffuses out of the CarboSil films without any topcoat over the period\nof 22 days, compared to 35% for the films with the CarboSil topcoat\nand only 19% for the films with the SR topcoat. For each type of film,\nthe rate of SNAP leaching is the fastest in the first few hours, and\nthen significantly lower amounts of SNAP continue to diffuse into\nthe PBS over sequential days. The SR topcoat, which is a cross-linked\npolymer, can reduce the amount of SNAP diffusion into the soaking\nsolution better than the non-cross-linked CarboSil topcoat. Similar\nleaching patterns are observed for the NAP and NAP disulfide species\nfrom the films with different topcoats (Figure 2b,c). NAP is a widely used chelating and\ndetoxifying agent for treatment of heavy metal poisoning (e.g., mercury,\ncadmium, and arsenic, etc.).49\u221254 Indeed, it hastens the excretion of poisons out of human body without\ninducing toxic effects, and it represents a protective measure against\nfree radical induced organ injury.53 Therefore,\nit is reasonable to believe that small amounts NAP and/or the dimer\nof NAP (NAP disulfide) emitted from the polymer into the contacting\nbuffer or blood would not likely cause any toxic response in clinical\napplications.10\n\nThe 10 wt % SNAP-doped CarboSil film with SR topcoats releases\nNO above 0.5 \u00d7 10\u201310 mol cm\u20132 min\u20131, the lower end of endothelial NO flux levels,\nfor more than 3 weeks under physiological conditions (see Figure 3a). A large burst\nof NO release was observed by the NOA (via chemiluminescence) on day\n0 that correlates with the rapid SNAP leaching into the PBS buffer\nin the first few hours. The cumulative amount of SNAP that releases\nNO was calculated based on the NOA measurements and compared to the\ninitial amount doped within the film. The total NO release from polymer\nfilms can originate from the SNAP decomposing and releasing NO inside\nthe polymer phase as well as from SNAP molecules that diffuse out\nof the polymer into the PBS buffer. Assuming that the NAP and NAP\ndisulfide detected in the buffer are reaction products of the original\nSNAP leached from the polymer, the total amount of SNAP that leaches\nout after time t should be [SNAP]total = [SNAP]t + [NAP]t + 2 \u00d7 [NAP disulfide]t. Since\nthe films were placed into fresh PBS during NOA measurements, the\nNO release detected by the NOA can be only attributed to the SNAP\ndecomposing and releasing NO from inside the polymer phase ([NO]NOA) (assuming the amount of SNAP leaching during the measurement\nwas negligible). Therefore, the total NO release ([NO]total) from the polymer film is [NO]total = [NO]NOA + [SNAP]total, which was compared with the initial SNAP\nin the CarboSil film. As shown in Figure 3b, the total moles of SNAP ([SNAP]total) leached out over 22 days, the time period of the leaching experiment,\nis approximately 38.5% of the total NO released ([NO]total) and, therefore, more than 60% of the total NO is, in fact, released\nfrom the polymer phase. This suggests that the leaching process is\nmuch slower than the rate of NO release from the polymers, so it is\nlikely that, after the first day, NO release from within the polymer\n(primarily in the water-rich regions near the outer surfaces of the\npolymers) is the primary source of NO emission. The ability of the SNAP/CarboSil\npolymer system to deliver localized NO continuously and sufficiently\nto sites of interest makes it a very promising material for biomedical\napplications.\n\nTo better understand\nthe fundamental reasons for which SNAP is so stable in CarboSil and\nis able to release NO for 3 weeks, a series of solid phase characterization\nhas been conducted. Films of 5 wt % SNAP-doped CarboSil and blank\nCarboSil were viewed under a polarized optical microscope. Distinguished\ncrystalline patterns were found in the SNAP/CarboSil film in comparison\nwith the blank film (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). Therefore, it is hypothesized that SNAP crystallized\nin the polymer matrix during the solvent evaporation process, as opposed\nto all dissolving in the polymer and forming a homogeneous matrix\nas previously suggested.10 We further compared\nthe Raman spectra of SNAP crystals, blank CarboSil film, and 15 wt\n% SNAP/CarboSil film. The spectrum of 15 wt % SNAP/CarboSil (Figure S4) showed characteristic peaks of both\nCarboSil and crystalline SNAP that further substantiates the existence\nof crystalline SNAP within the polymer film.\n\nIn order to identify\nthe form of crystalline SNAP detected in the Raman spectroscopy characterization,\npowder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis of the synthesized SNAP crystals\nwas conducted, and the results agree with the patterns of the orthorhombic\nSNAP reported in the literature (see Figure S5). It has been suggested that, in orthorhombic SNAP, one SNAP molecule\ncan form 4 intermolecular hydrogen bonds with 4 surrounding SNAP molecules\n(Figure S6).55 The PXRD results of SNAP-doped CarboSil films (1\u201315 wt %)\nindicate that the characteristic film diffraction patterns are convolutions\nof blank Carbosil and the crystalline SNAP powder patterns (see Figure 4). The results also\nsuggest that, as the amount of doped SNAP increases (for films with\ngreater than 4 wt % SNAP), the intensity of orthorhombic SNAP peaks\nin the obtained PXRD pattern is enhanced, indicating a greater percentage\nof crystalline SNAP within the polymer films. However, SNAP peaks\ncould barely be detected in PXRD patterns for samples with <4 wt\n% doped SNAP, indicating an apparent threshold for formation of the\ncrystalline form of SNAP within CarboSil. Since all SNAP-doped CarboSil\nfilms (including those with <4 wt %) have a light green color,\nit is speculated that SNAP partially dissolves in the polymer, forming\na polymer solution, and any excess SNAP beyond the polymer solubility\nlimit crystallizes in the orthorhombic form during the THF evaporation\nand embeds in the polymer. This explanation is in agreement with the\nRaman spectroscopy and PXRD results that orthorhombic SNAP crystals\nare detected only when the SNAP concentration exceeds the solubility\nof SNAP in the CarboSil polymer. To calculate the SNAP solubility\nin the CarboSil polymer, a linear least-squares regression was conducted\n(see the Supporting Information) using\nthree main PXRD peaks. The calculated solubility is 3.6, 3.5, and\n3.9 wt %, respectively (see Figure S7),\nindicating that the solubility of SNAP in CarboSil was ca. 3.4\u20134.0\nwt %.\n\nCharacterizing the stabilities of SNAP-doped CarboSil films\nusing PXRD further verifies the dissolution hypothesis. We compared\nthe PXRD patterns of freshly prepared 5 and 15 wt % SNAP-doped CarboSil\nsamples as well as the samples stored under ambient light at room\ntemperature for 10 days under the same conditions. We hypothesize\nthat the solubilized SNAP behaves as a solute, dissolving in the CarboSil\npolymer that acts as the solvent, and it is less stable at room temperature\nand decomposes faster than the crystalline SNAP. As the solubilized\nSNAP in the polymer decomposes and the SNAP in the polymer is under\nsaturation, the crystalline SNAP is driven to gradually dissolve into\nthe CarboSil polymer. For 5 wt % fresh samples, most of the SNAP added\nduring preparation is dissolved in the polymer, which is labile and\nmore likely to decompose via thermal decomposition. However, for the\n15 wt % SNAP films, most of the SNAP in the film (ca. 11\u201312\nwt %) is stabilized by the intermolecular hydrogen bonding.55 The percentage of SNAP remaining in the 5 and\n15 wt % films after 10 days under ambient light is 19.8 and 83.2 wt\n% of the initial amount, respectively. The attenuation of orthorhombic\nSNAP peaks in 5 wt % SNAP-doped CarboSil films relative to the fresh\nsamples is indeed much greater than that of the 15 wt % samples (see Figure S8) where the SNAP peak changes are almost\nundetectable, thus validating our hypothesis.\n\nIntermolecular\nhydrogen bonding in the SNAP crystals is one of the key reasons for\nthe elevated stability of SNAP-doped CarboSil films during dry storage\nfor 8 months. In addition, as a tertiary nitrosothiol, the SNAP molecule\nitself is more stable with respect to the loss of NO than other primary\nand secondary RSNOs due to the steric hindrance effect imposed by\nthe gem methyl group on the dimerization of the radicals that leads\nto the formation of the sulfur bridge10,40,41,45 and the hindered rotation\nof the R\u2014S\u2013N\u2014O linkage at room temperature.55 The literature also suggests that the acetamide\ngroup in SNAP plays a key role in increasing the S\u2013NO bond\nstrength and reducing the NO liability.46 Moreover, it has also been reported that the viscosity of the polymer\nimposes an important cage effect on the S\u2013NO bond cleavage\nand radical pair formation. Specifically, the restricted mobility\nof soluble SNAP molecules in the CarboSil microenvironment may favor\nthe recombination of the primary radicals rather than radicals escaping\nfrom the solvent cage.10,12,37 Therefore, doping SNAP into the polymer represents a viable option\nfor storage and handling for long-term NO release applications. Further\nstudies comparing SNAP solubility in different polymer matrixes and\nexamining the relationship between the SNAP crystallization/dissolution\nprocess and the stability of SNAP in certain polymers could be quite\nuseful in designing additional NO release polymers with enhanced stability\nand long-term shelf life.\n\nLastly, Raman mapping characterization\nusing static scans was employed to determine the 2D representation\nof the SNAP crystal distribution in 3 and 5 wt % SNAP-doped CarboSil\nfilms. The green spots in Figure 5 represent regions where the orthorhombic SNAP peaks\nare detected and are found in large quantities only in the 5 wt %\nSNAP/CarboSil film, but not in 3 wt % films. This finding correlates\nwith the PXRD peak area fitting results that indicate that the solubility\nof SNAP in polymer is ca. 3.4\u20134.0 wt %. However, the exact\ngrain sizes of the SNAP crystals could not yet be quantified by this\nmethod because the focal depth of the laser is likely to exceed the\ngrain size of the crystal. Thus, the green spots could represent crystals\nfrom both the surface and deeper within the polymer phase, which results\nin difficulty in distinguishing any individual crystal from overlaid\ncrystals.\n\nIn order to generate NO release\n(at the higher end of the normal physiological flux level) for longer\nperiods, 20 wt % SNAP-doped CarboSil catheters were prepared as described\nin the Experimental Section. These devices\ncan release physiological levels of NO for 28 days at 37 \u00b0C (see\nFigure S9 in the Supporting Information). Because stable NO releasing devices can abate bacterial adhesion\nand colonization associated with catheterization, we examined the\nantibiofilm properties of catheter segments with S. aureus for 7 days in a drip-flow biofilm reactor at 37 \u00b0C. The drip-flow\nbioreactor was chosen because it promotes the growth of the bacteria\nthat grows at the air\u2013liquid interface, which mimics the condition\nof the surface of indwelling intravascular catheters. Results for\n7 day S. aureus biofilms shows a 5 logarithmic unit\nreduction in viable cell count on the surfaces of NO release catheters\nsegments when compared to the control segments (see Figure 6a). This finding is further\ncorroborated by the fluorescent images (Figure 6b), which illustrates the live/dead bacteria\nas well as the bacterial surface coverage on the surfaces of both\ncatheters, respectively. These results demonstrate that the SNAP/CarboSil\ncatheter provides an approach that can potentially reduce/prevent\ncatheter-related bloodstream infections.\n\nIn order to demonstrate\nthe potential benefits of using SNAP-doped CarboSil polymer as a thromboresistant\nmaterial, acute 7 h rabbit experiments were conducted to study the\neffect of NO release from CarboSil catheters on the thrombus formation\narea. The NO release from the SNAP/CarboSil catheter maintains an\naverage flux of approximately 5.5 \u00d7 10\u201310 mol\ncm\u20132 min\u20131 for 7 h at 37 \u00b0C\n(see Figure S10 in the Supporting Information). One SNAP/CarboSil and one control catheter (non-SNAP) were placed\ninto the external jugular veins of each rabbit for 7 h. Owing to the\nvery slow loss of SNAP from the catheter reservoir (given the composite\nnature of the material), the dose of SNAP leached from the catheters\nis significantly below the threshold that can induce the adverse reactions.10\n\nAfter 7 h of implantation, the catheters\nwere carefully removed from the rabbit veins, leaving the thrombus\nformation intact on the surface. To determine whether the NO release\nreduced the clotting on the catheter surface, digital images of the\ncatheter surfaces were taken, and the two-dimensional (2D) representation\nof the thrombus area was quantitated using ImageJ software from the\nNIH. As shown in Figure 7, the thrombus formation is significantly reduced for the SNAP/CarboSil\ncatheters with NO release ability when compared to the controls (n = 3 rabbit experiments). The SNAP/CarboSil catheters were\nalso examined for NO release rates via chemiluminescence after explantation,\nand they still exhibit an average flux of 3.8 \u00b1 0.2 mol cm\u20132 min\u20131. This clearly demonstrates\nthat the localized NO release from the catheter surface can significantly\nreduce platelet activation and thrombus formation.\n\nIn\nthis study, we have shown that SNAP doped into the CarboSil 20 80A\npolymer forms a polymer\u2013crystal composite during solvent evaporation\nand can locally release NO over a 22 day period via thermal decomposition.\nUtilizing a cross-linked silicone rubber topcoat can greatly reduce\nthe amount of SNAP, NAP, and NAP disulfide leaching as measured by\nLC\u2013MS. The 10 wt % SNAP/CarboSil has excellent stability during\nthe 8 month shelf life study at 37 \u00b0C as well as during ethylene\noxide sterilization, where 88.5% and 91.8% of the initial SNAP remain\nin the polymer, respectively. These data suggest the practicality\nof sterilizing, storing, and shipping biomedical devices made with\nor coated with this material. Raman spectroscopy and PXRD characterization\nof SNAP-doped CarboSil films demonstrate that the solubility of SNAP\nin CarboSil is ca. 3.4\u20134.0 wt %. However, when the SNAP doping\nwt % is higher than this solubility threshold, SNAP exists in an orthorhombic\ncrystal form within the bulk of the polymer, in which intermolecular\nhydrogen bonds between SNAP molecules play a key role in maintaining\nthe RSNO stability and functionality over a long period of time. Solubilized\nSNAP in the polymer phase behaves like a solute in the solid solution\npolymer system and is less stable and decomposes faster than the crystalline\nSNAP. When the solubilized SNAP in polymer decomposes/releases NO\nand the SNAP within the polymer phase is under saturation, the crystalline\nSNAP in the bulk of the polymer is driven to gradually dissolve into\nthe polymer and further release NO. The NO release process ceases\nafter 22 days when all the SNAP crystals are depleted. The catheters\nfabricated with this SNAP composite are shown to exhibit significant\nantibiofilm properties against S. aureus, and such\ncatheters could eventually be used to reduce the rate of nosocomial\ncatheter related bloodstream infections. The SNAP/CarboSil catheters\nalso greatly reduce thrombus formation during 7 h implantation within\nthe veins of rabbits when compared to the corresponding control catheters.\nGiven its excellent stability and long-term NO release capability,\nthe new SNAP-doped CarboSil composite system offers many new opportunities\nto improve the biocompatibility of biomedical devices for many applications."}
