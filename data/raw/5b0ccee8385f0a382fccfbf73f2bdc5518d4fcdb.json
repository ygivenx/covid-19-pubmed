HCoV-229E binds to the aminopeptidase N receptor (CD13) [5] and enters cells via endosomal and cell-surface pathways using proteases [6, 7] . HCoV-229E can replicate in an airway epithelial cell line [8] ; however, HCoV-229E replication in primary human airway epithelial cell cultures has not been studied.\n\nLong-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), long-acting b 2 -agonists (LABAs), and inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) prevent COPD and bronchial asthma exacerbation [9, 10] induced by viral infection, including infection with HCoV-229E [3, 4] . We reported that the LAMA tiotropium, the LABA formoterol, and the ICS budesonide reduce rhinovirus replication by reducing receptor expression and/or the number of acidic endosomes where rhinoviral RNA enters the cytoplasm [11, 12] . Acidic endosomes are also critical for the entry of HCoV-229E [7] ; however, the effects of these drugs on HCoV-229E replication are unknown.\n\nThe clinical benefits of these drugs may be related to various effects, including the inhibition of viral infectioninduced cytokine production, bronchospasm, and mucus hypersecretion [13] . However, the effects of these drugs on HCoV-229E infection-induced cytokine production in airway cells are unclear.\n\nIn the present study, we examined the inhibitory effects of the LAMA glycopyrronium, the LABA formoterol, and the ICS budesonide on HCoV-229E replication in primary human nasal epithelial (HNE) and human tracheal epithelial (HTE) cells cultured on filter membranes with air-interface methods, which exhibited a higher differentiation than those cultured in immersion conditions [14] . We also examined the effects of these drugs on CD13 expression and acidic endosomes to study the mechanisms underlying their effects.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nNasal polyps were obtained from 50 subjects with chronic rhinosinusitis (age; 55 \u00b1 2 y) undergoing endoscopic surgery. Tracheal samples were obtained from 10 patients after death (age; 69 \u00b1 4 years). The sex, reason for surgery, cause of death, presence of allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, or COPD, as well as the drugs used for treatment, are shown in Table 1 .\n\nA total of 21, 11, 18, 18 , and 0 subjects were treated with nasal corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, ICSs, LABAs, or LAMAs, respectively. One tracheal sample donor had COPD. This study was approved by the Tohoku University Ethics Committee (IRB numbers: 2018-1-15 and 2018-1-16). Cells were cultured on filter membranes (Transwell, Corning, ME, USA) [14] , in 24-well plates (Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA), or on coverslips in Petri-dishes [15] .\n\nA stock of clinically isolated HCoV-229E [2] was prepared by infecting Rhesus monkey kidney epithelial (LLC-MK2) cells.\n\nHCoV-229E in the airway surface liquids (ASLs) was detected and titrated using LLC-MK2 cells and endpoint methods [15, 16] .

The collected medium was used to examine the HCoV-229E titers or the levels of CD13, cyclic AMP (cAMP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and interferons (IFNs) [17] . The basolateral supernatant was collected and replaced with fresh medium [17] and was used to measure the cAMP and IFN levels.\n\nThe cells were pretreated with drugs (100 nM) starting at 72 h before infection and lasting until the end of the experimental period [15] . To determine the concentration-dependent effects of the drugs, the cells were pretreated with the drugs at concentrations ranging from 10 \u00c09 M to 10 \u00c06 M. Uninfected cells were pretreated with the drugs (100 nM, 72 h) to examine their effect on CD13 expression, acidic endosomes, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) activation.\n\nThe drugs were obtained from AstraZeneca PLC (Cambridge, UK).\n\nEffects of drugs on susceptibility to HCoV-229E infection\n\nThe cells were pretreated with drugs (100 nM, 72 h) before infection. The susceptibility to HCoV-229E infection was evaluated as previously described [15] .\n\nQuantification of HCoV-229E RNA and mRNA levels of CD13 and interferons\n\nThe levels of HCoV-229E RNA and mRNA of CD13, IFN-b, IFNl 1 , or IFN-g were determined using real-time quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using TaqMan\u00ae Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) or TB Green Premix Ex Taq\u2122 (Takara, Shiga, Japan), as previously described [18e22].\n\nMeasurement of CD13, cAMP, and cytokine production and NF-kB activation\n\nThe levels of CD13, cAMP, IL-6, and IL-8 were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Boster Bio, CA, USA), a cyclic AMP selective enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kit (Cayman Chemicals, MI, USA), a solid phase chemiluminescent ELISA kit (QuantinGlo\u00ae; ELISA, R&D Systems, MN, USA), and an IL-8 EIA kit (Invitrogen, CA, USA). The levels of IFN-b, IFN-l 1 , or IFN-g were measured using a Human IFN-b Quantikine ELISA Kit, a Human IL-29/ IFN-l 1 DuoSet ELISA kit (R&D Systems), and a Quantikine Human IFN-g Immunoassay kit.\n\nThe presence of translocated p50 and p65 in nuclear extracts was assessed using a TransAM NFkB Family Kit (Active Motif), as previously described [15] .\n\nThe distribution and fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes in the cells were measured with LysoSensor DND-189 dye (Molecular Probes, OR, USA) using live-cell imaging [15] . The fluorescence intensity was calculated using a fluorescence image analyzer system (Lumina Vision\u00ae; Mitani, Fukui, Japan).\n\nThe results are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analysis was performed using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The subsequent post-hoc analyses were performed using Bonferroni's method. Student's t-test was used for comparisons between two groups. Values of p < 0.05 were indicated a significant difference. In all experiments, n refers to the number of donors (nasal tissue or trachea) from whom the epithelial cells were obtained. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 20 (IBM Japan, Tokyo, Japan).\n\nHCoV-229E was detected in the ASL 24 h after infection and increased between 24 h and 72 h (p < 0.05 by ANOVA), Peak titers were observed between 24 h and 120 h (Fig. 1Ae1D ). Pretreatment with glycopyrronium (100 nM), formoterol (100 nM), and a combination of glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide (GFB; 100 nM each drug) decreased the viral titers ( Fig. 1A , 1B, 1D and 1E); however, treatment with budesonide alone (100 nM) did not decrease the viral titers ( Fig. 1C and E).\n\nThe viral titers in the GFB-pretreated cells were lower than those in cells treated with glycopyrronium, formoterol, or budesonide alone (Fig. 1E) .\n\nThe selective b 2 -adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI 118,551 (ICI, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) [23] reversed the inhibitory effects of formoterol on viral titers, and the CD13 inhibitor 2 0 2 0dipyridyl [5] reduced the viral titers (Fig. 1E) .\n\nThe peak titers in cells from asthmatic patients (5.11 \u00b1 0.28 log 10 TCID 50 /mL, n \u00bc 18; TCID: tissue culture infective dose), which were defined according to the 2017 Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines [10] , or the titers from allergic rhinitis patients (4.80 \u00b1 0.37 log 10 TCID 50 /mL, n \u00bc 10), tended to be higher than those from patients without asthma and allergic rhinitis (4.36 \u00b1 0.61 log 10 TCID 50 /mL, n \u00bc 12). However, these differences were not significant (p > 0.10). Pretreatment with glycopyrronium, formoterol, and GFB decreased the HCoV-229E RNA levels at 72 h after infection, and ICI reversed the effects of formoterol (Fig. 1G) . The HCoV-229E RNA levels in GFB-pretreated cells were lower than those in cells treated with glycopyrronium, formoterol, or budesonide alone (Fig. 1G ). The results are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM of five (A-D, FeH) or seven (E) subjects. Significant differences compared with cells pretreated with vehicle are indicated by *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001. Significant differences compared with cells treated with glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide are indicated by \u2021 p < 0.05, y p < 0.05, and \u00a7 p < 0.05, respectively. \n\nWhen the viral release was measured in ASL collected 72 h after infection, the minimum dose of HCoV-229E necessary to infect HNE cells pretreated with glycopyrronium, formoterol, or GFB was higher than the dose needed to infect the vehicletreated cells. ICI reversed the effects of formoterol (Fig. 1H ).\n\nConcentration-dependent effects on HCoV-229E replication Pretreatment of HNE cells with glycopyrronium at a concentration of 100 nM or higher, with formoterol at 10 nM or higher, and with GFB at 10 nM or higher reduced the HCoV-229E titers in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2) . Pretreatment with budesonide at concentrations less than 1 mM did not reduce the HCoV-229 E titers.\n\nUninfected HNE cells expressed a significant amount of CD13 mRNA. CD13 protein was detected in the ASL (Fig. 3A and B) . The mRNA and protein levels of CD13 in cells treated with formoterol or GFB were lower than those in vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 3A and B) . Treatment with glycopyrronium or budesonide alone did not affect CD13 expression. \n\nThe treatment of HNE cells with glycopyrronium, formoterol, and GFB reduced the number and fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes (Fig. 3Ce3G) . ICI reversed the effects of formoterol (Fig. 3G ).\n\nEffects of formoterol on cAMP production and the effects of cAMP on viral replication\n\nThe cAMP levels in basolateral supernatants increased to approximately 8 mM at 72 h after treatment with formoterol (Fig. 4A) . Furthermore, pretreatment with cAMP (10 mM and 100 mM) reduced the viral titers, CD13 mRNA and protein levels, as well as the fluorescence intensity, of the acidic endosomes (Fig. 4Be4E ).\n\nThe levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in the ASL of uninfected HNE cells cultured for 24 h or 72 h did not differ from those at time 0 ( Fig. 5A and B) . HCoV-229E infection increased IL-6 levels in cells cultured for 24 and 72 h and IL-8 levels in cells cultured for 72 h (Fig. 5A and B) . The NF-kB inhibitor caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) (25 mg/mL) (Calbiochem, CA, USA) [24] reduced the levels of IL-6 and IL-8 after infection (Fig. 5A and B ). Before infection, pretreatment with formoterol, budesonide, or GFB, but not glycopyrronium, reduced the baseline AeG: The concentrations of glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide were 100 nM. The results are presented as the mean \u00b1 SEM of five (A and B) or eight (G) subjects. Significant differences compared with cells pretreated with vehicle are indicated by *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 (A, B, and G). Significant differences compared with cells pretreated with formoterol are indicated by y p < 0.05 and yy p < 0.01 (A, B, and G). Significant differences compared with cells pretreated with glycopyrronium are indicated by \u2021 p < 0.05 (B).\n\nsecretion of IL-6 and IL-8 compared with that in the vehicletreated cells (Fig. 5C and D) .\n\nPretreatment with glycopyrronium, formoterol, budesonide, and GFB reduced the infection-induced secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 compared with that of vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 5C  and D) . The IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations in GFB-treated cells were lower than those in cells treated with glycopyrronium, formoterol, or budesonide alone ( Fig. 5C and D) .\n\nThe mRNA levels of IFN-b, IFN-l 1 , and IFN-g in HNE cells increased after infection. Pretreatment with glycopyrronium, formoterol, budesonide, and GFB decreased these levels (Fig. 5EeG) . In contrast, the concentrations of IFN-b, IFN-l 1 , and IFN-g in ASL and the basolateral supernatants were below the detection limits (7.8 pg/mL for IFN-b, 62.5 pg/mL for IFN-l 1 , and 15.6 pg/mL for IFN-g) before and after infection.\n\nEffects on NF-kB Glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide treatment of uninfected HNE cells reduced the amounts of NF-kB p50 and p65 in the nuclear extracts compared with those in the vehicle-treated cells. The effects of GFB were additive (Fig. 6 ).\n\nWe also confirmed the effects of the drugs on HCoV-229E replication in HTE cells. Pretreatment with glycopyrronium (100 nM), formoterol (100 nM), or GFB (100 nM) and 2 0 2 0dipyridyl (2.5 mM) decreased the HCoV-229E titers. Moreover, the viral titers of the GFB-treated cells were lower than those of cells pretreated with glycopyrronium, formoterol, or budesonide alone (all 100 nM) (Fig. 7A) . The mRNA and ASL protein levels of CD13 in uninfected HTE cells pretreated with formoterol or GFB were lower than those in vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 7B and C) .\n\nPretreatment with glycopyrronium, formoterol, or GFB decreased the fluorescence intensity of the acidic endosomes compared with that of vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 7D) .\n\nBefore infection, pretreatment with formoterol or GFB reduced the baseline secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 compared with that of vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 7E and F) .\n\nHCoV-229E infection increased the IL-6 levels at 24 and 72 h and IL-8 levels at 72 h after infection (data at 24 h not shown). Pretreatment with glycopyrronium, formoterol, budesonide, or GFB reduced the infectioninduced increase in IL-6 and IL-8 secretion compared with that of the vehicle (Fig. 7E and F) . The IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations in GFB-treated cells were lower than those in cells treated with glycopyrronium, formoterol, or budesonide alone (Fig. 7E and F) . CAPE (25 mg/mL) reduced A: Significant differences compared with the values of HTE cells after infection that were treated with vehicle, glycopyrronium, formoterol, or budesonide are indicated by \u00b6 p < 0.05 and \u00b6 \u00b6 p < 0.01, \u2021 p < 0.05, y p < 0.05, or \u00a7 p < 0.01, respectively. BeD: Significant differences compared with the values of uninfected HTE cells treated with vehicle, glycopyrronium, formoterol, or budesonide are indicated by *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.05, \u2021 p < 0.05, y p < 0.05 and yy p < 0.01, or \u00a7 p < 0.01, respectively. EeI: Significant differences compared with the values from uninfected vehicle-treated HTE cells are indicated by *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01. Significant differences compared with the values of HTE cells after infection treated with vehicle, glycopyrronium, formoterol, or budesonide are indicated by \u00b6 p < 0.05 and \u00b6 \u00b6 p < 0.01, \u2021 p < 0.05, y p < 0.05, or \u00a7 p < 0.01, respectively. the infection-induced increase in IL-6 and IL-8 secretion ( Fig. 7E and F) .\n\nICI (1 mM) reversed the inhibitory effects of formoterol on viral titers, mRNA, and protein levels of CD13, acidic endosomes, and the production of IL-6 and IL-8 (Fig. 7Ae7F) .\n\nThe mRNA levels of IFN-b, IFN-l 1 , and IFN-g in HTE cells increased after infection. Pretreatment with glycopyrronium, formoterol, budesonide, and GFB decreased these levels ( Fig.  7G-I) . In contrast, the protein concentrations of IFN-b, IFN-l 1 , and IFN-g in ASL and the basolateral supernatant were below the detection limits.\n\nWe demonstrated that pretreatment of primary HNE and HTE cell cultures with glycopyrronium, formoterol, or a combination of the three drugs (glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide; GFB) reduced HCoV-229E replication and cytokine (IL-6 and IL-8) concentrations in ASL. The selective b 2 -adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI 118,551 reversed the inhibitory effects of formoterol. Formoterol and GFB both reduced the expression of CD13, the HCoV-229E receptor [5] . An inhibitor of CD13, 2, 2 0 -dipyridyl, reduced the viral titers. These findings suggest that these drugs inhibit HCoV-229E replication partly via the regulation of receptor expression. There was a reduction in the HCoV-229E titer and CD13 expression in HNE cells pretreated with cAMP at similar levels to those secreted into the supernatant when cells were treated with formoterol. The inhibitory effects of formoterol on CD13 expression were consistent with the results of a previous report by Danielsen et al., which found that CD13 expression in the intestinal mucosa was decreased by forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase [25] , which is activated by formoterol [26] . Therefore, formoterol may decrease HCoV-229E replication partly by modulating receptor expression via cAMP production.\n\nIn addition, pretreatment with glycopyrronium, formoterol, and GFB reduced the number and fluorescence intensity of acidic endosomes where HCoV-229E RNA enters the cytoplasm [7] . Therefore, these drugs may also inhibit HCoV-229E replication by inhibiting the functioning of acidic endosomes.\n\nEndosomal pH is regulated by the vacuolar H \u00fe -ATPase [27] and ion transport across Na \u00fe /H \u00fe exchangers [28] . cAMP increases endosomal pH by inhibiting an Na \u00fe /H \u00fe exchanger [29] . We demonstrated that formoterol increased the cAMP levels in HNE cells, which decreased the number of acidic endosomes, as previously reported for HTE cells [30] . Therefore, formoterol may inhibit the functioning of Na \u00fe /H \u00fe exchangers via the production of cAMP in cells.\n\nFurthermore, acetylcholine activates H \u00fe /K \u00fe -ATPase in gastric cells [31] , while bafilomycin A 1 , an inhibitor of H \u00fe -ATPase [32] , inhibits the acetylcholine-induced increase in cytoplasmic pH [33] . Therefore, glycopyrronium may inhibit the activity of H \u00fe /K \u00fe -ATPase and/or H \u00fe -ATPases in airway epithelial cells.\n\nThe glycopyrronium concentration in the lungs is estimated to be 19.5 ng/mL (49 nM), according to the delivery rate in the lungs [34, 35] . Furthermore, we found that formoterol and GFB decreased the viral titers at a concentration of 10 nM. Similar levels of plasma formoterol have been reported previously in the literature [36] . Therefore, glycopyrronium and formoterol may reduce HCoV-229E replication at safe clinical doses.\n\nIL-6 and IL-8 are related to airway inflammation in COPD and bronchial asthma exacerbation induced by viral infection [4, 13] . The decreased production of IL-6 and IL-8 in cells pretreated with glycopyrronium, formoterol, and budesonide, as well as the increased inhibitory effects of GFB observed in the present study, may be associated with the inhibitory effects of these drugs on COPD and bronchial asthma exacerbation [9, 10] .\n\nIn the present study, significant mRNA levels of IFN-b, IFNl 1 and IFN-g were detected in cells, the production of which was reduced by treatment with drugs, although the concentrations of IFN-b, IFN-l 1 , and IFN-g in the ASL and basolateral supernatant were undetectable. These findings are consistent with those of a previous study demonstrating that rhinoviral infection induced innate immunity by stimulating the interferon system in human airway epithelial cells and that treatment with fluticasone reduced IFN production [37] . The reduced production of IFN-b, IFN-l 1 , and IFN-g could be associated with decreased HCoV-229E replication or the suppression of toll-like receptor 3 [37, 38] .\n\nAcetylcholine induces NF-kB activation [39] , which is associated with cytokine production [39, 40] . Formoterol and budesonide have been shown to inhibit NF-kB activity [11] . In addition, the NF-kB inhibitor CAPE decreased the production of IL-6 and IL-8 after HCoV-229E infection. Therefore, reduced NF-kB activation could be associated with the inhibition of cytokine production by the drugs used in the present study.\n\nBudesonide did not decrease the HCoV-229E titers and CD13 expression; however, budesonide inhibits rhinoviral replication by reducing the expression of its receptor, ICAM-1 [11, 41] . Although the subjects from whom nasal tissues were obtained were treated with various drugs, including corticosteroids, pretreatment with budesonide did not reduce HCoV-229E replication in HTE cells from patients who were not treated with corticosteroids. Sorrell et al. demonstrated that corticosteroids do not reduce CD13 expression in fibroblasts [42] . Therefore, the different effects of budesonide on receptor expression may lead to differences in the effects on the replication of HCoV-229E and rhinoviruses.\n\nHNE and HTE cells have been used in several studies of respiratory viral infection [43e45]. Here, we used HNE and HTE cells because we previously used these cells in infection studies [11, 12, 15, 46] . However, because bronchi and alveoli are the main sites of the pathogenesis of COPD and bronchial asthma exacerbations, bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells were used to reveal the effects of viral infection on exacerbations and the effects of drugs [37, 47] . Therefore, further studies using bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells will be needed to confirm HCoV-229E replication and the effects of drugs.\n\nThis study is the first to demonstrate that glycopyrronium, formoterol, and a combination of glycopyrronium,"}
