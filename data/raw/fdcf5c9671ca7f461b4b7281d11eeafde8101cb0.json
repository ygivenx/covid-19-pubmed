{"title": "Synthesis of 3-fluoro-6-S-(2-S-pyridyl) nucleosides as potential lead cytostatic agents", "body": "Nucleoside analogs markedly contribute to the chemotherapy of cancer and viral diseases [1] [2] [3] [4] . However, novel applications are still being explored and new nucleoside structures have reached the clinic as effective agents for the treatment of AIDS [5] , herpes virus infections [6] and viral hepatitis [7] .\n\nFluorine-containing nucleosides and their analogs are attractive compounds and have drawn special attention [8] [9] [10] [11] , with the fluorine incorporated either on the base moiety or on the sugar part frequently leading to a drastic change in biological activity, stability and bioavailability [8, 12, 13] . Our recent data have revealed, that new classes of uncommon fluorinated pyranonucleosides have a promising potential in combating the rotaviral infections, in the treatment of colon cancer and are efficient antitumor growth inhibitors [10, 11, 14, 15] . Experimental data also suggested, that human Poly(A)-specific ribonuclease is among the molecular targets of these compounds and could act therapeutically by lowering the mRNA turnover rate [16] .\n\nIn the field of nucleosides, sulfur chemistry appears particularly fruitful in the development of therapeutic agents [17, 18] . Considerable interest has been drawn in the synthesis of thionucleoside analogs [18] [19] [20] [21] and nucleosidyl disulfides [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] , attractive candidates for use as both antiviral and antineoplastic agents [21, 24, 27] , with the latter being assessed as prodrugs able to interfere with HIV reverse transcription [21, 22, 26] . Particularly, nucleosides in which the primary hydroxyl group is replaced by a thiol-or an alkylthio-group, are promising antiviral agents since they disrupt essential viral macromolecular methylation processes [28, 29] .\n\nIn view of the above data and our recent findings on the biology of modified nucleosides, as templates for antiviral and anticancer activity [10, 11, [14] [15] [16] [30] [31] [32] , we turned our attention to the possible improvement of the biological properties of such molecules. We thus synthesised a series of glucopyranosyl nucleoside analogs, where we combined both a pharmacologically compatible fluorine and a sulfur/thiopyridine moiety in the sugar part. In this paper, we report on two efficient methods for their preparation and supply data on their biological activity.\n\nMelting points were recorded in a Mel-Temp apparatus and are uncorrected.

After 2 (L1210, FM3A), 3 (CEM) or 4 (HeLa) days, the viable cell number was counted using a Coulter counter apparatus. The 50% cytostatic concentration (CC 50 ) was defined as the compound concentration required to inhibit tumor cell proliferation by 50%.\n\nThe conversion of dThd to thymine, Urd to uracil and compounds 13b and 13c to the free base by human recombinant thymidine phosphorylase and uridine phosphorylase type 1 (kindly provided by Dr. T.P. Roosild, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA) was measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. To determine the conversion activity, a high amount of recombinant enzyme was incubated with 100 lM of dThd or 13b and 13c in TP-buffer (10 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 /K 2 HPO 4 and 150 mM NaCl) or UP-buffer (same as TP-buffer, but 300 mM NaCl instead of 150 mM). At 20, 40 and 60 min, 100 lL aliquots of the reaction mixtures were withdrawn and heated at 95\u00b0C for 3 min to inactivate the enzyme. dThd and Urd were separated from thymine and uracil and 13b and 13c were separated from 5-FU and uracil on a reverse-phase RP-8 column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and quantified by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis (Alliance 2690, Waters, Milford, MA). The separation was performed by a linear gradient from 98% buffer B (50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 and 5 mM heptane sulfonic acid, pH 3.2), to 20% buffer B + 80% acetonitrile (8 min 98% buffer B + 2% acetonitrile; 5 min linear gradient of 98% buffer B + 2% acetonitrile to 20% buffer B + 80% acetonitrile; 10 min 20% buffer B + 80% acetonitrile, followed by equilibration at 98% buffer B + 2% acetonitrile). Retention times for thymine and dThd were, respectively, 5.1 and 10.8 min, for uracil and Urd, respectively, 2.1 and 2.4 min and for 13b, 13c and 5-FU, respectively, 20.1, 20.1 and 2.4 min. UV-based detection was performed at 267 nm.\n\nTwo main strategies were used for the synthesis of 3-fluoro-6-S-(2-S-pyridyl) nucleosides 7a-c,f,g.\n\nOur first approach (Scheme 1) was focused on the preparation of 3-fluoro-6-thio-glucopyranosyl nucleosides of thymine 5a, uracil 5b, 5-fluorouracil 5c, N 4 -benzoyl cytosine 5d and N 6 -benzoyl adenine 5e as useful precursors toward the synthesis of 6-S-nucleosidyl S-pyridine disulfides. 1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-a-D-glucofuranose (1) [34] was readily transformed into the corresponding 1,2,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-glucopyranose [35] , which upon condensation with purine and pyrimidine bases afforded 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-b-D-glucopyranosyl nucleosides 2a-e [14] . Deprotection of nucleosides 2a-e in methanolic ammonia gave the fully unprotected derivatives 3a-c,f,g, while the base protected benzoylated derivatives 3d,e were obtained when 2d,e were treated with NaOH-ethanol-pyridine [10, 11, 14] . Treatment of 3a-e with ptoluenesulphonyl chloride in dry pyridine [35] and direct acetylation of the free hydroxyls at C-2 0 and C-4 0 with acetic anhydride/pyridine afforded the desired acetylated 6-O-tosylated derivatives 4a-e in very good yields. Subsequently, the tosylated derivatives 4a-e, after treatment with potassium thioacetate in hot N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) [36] [37] [38] , were converted into the corresponding thioacetates, 1-(2,4-di-O-acetyl-6-S-acetyl-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-6thio-b-D-glucopyranosyl)thymine (5a), 1-(2,4-di-O-acetyl-6-S-acetyl-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-6-thio-b-D-glucopyranosyl)uracil (5b), 1-(2,4di-O-acetyl-6-S-acetyl-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-6-thio-b-D-glucopyranosyl)5-fluorouracil (5c), 1-(2,4-di-O-acetyl-6-S-acetyl-3-deoxy-3fluoro-6-thio-b-D-glucopyranosyl)-N 4 -benzoyl cytosine (5d) and 9-(2,4-di-O-acetyl-6-S-acetyl-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-6-thio-b-D-glucopyranosyl)-N 6 -benzoyl adenine (5e), respectively. Deprotection of the b-protected thionucleosides 5a-e by methanolic ammonia and in situ thiopyridinylation in H 2 O, MeOH and 2,2-dipyridyl disulfide (DTDP) at room temperature [22] , led to the desired derivatives 7a-c. These reactions were completed within 20 h and the isolated yields of the 6-S-nucleosidyl S-pyridine disulfides were generally higher than 65%. Attempts to fully unprotect thionucleosides 5a-c resulted to the formation of their corresponding symmetrical disulfides 6a-c, the thiopyridinylation of which also led to the desired 6-S-nucleosidyl S-dipyridine disulfides 7a-c. It is noteworthy that only decomposition products were obtained after deprotection/thiopyridinylation of N 4 -benzoyl cytosine and N 6benzoyl adenine derivatives, 5d and 5e, respectively.\n\nIn order to circumvent this difficulty we chose to investigate a route in which the thionucleosides could be generated from a suitable thiopyridine sugar precursor. Our alternative synthetic pathway, in which compound 12 was envisioned as an appropriate glycosyl donour for the preparation of the suitable sugar, is described in Scheme 2. Initially, selective removal of the 5,6-O-isopropylidene group of starting material 1 [34] led to the formation of diol 8 [33] . Selective sulfonylation of 8 with p-toluenesulphonyl chloride in pyridine led to compound 9, which was treated with dihydropyran (DHP) and p-toluenesulphonic acid monohydrate in dry CH 2 Cl 2 in order to give compound 10 in very satisfactory overall yield. Displacement of the tosyl group with the thioacetyl moiety proceeded without difficulties to afford compound 11. Precursor 12 was readily available from glucofuranose 11 through hydrolysis with 90% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature and direct acetylation. Deprotection of the glycosyl donor 12 using methanolic ammonia, direct thiopyridinyla-tion [22] (8 mol excess of DTDP/MeOH/H 2 O) followed by acetylation led to the desired thiopyridine sugar 13. In order to prepare not only the target 6-S-nucleosidyl S-dipyridine disulfides 7f,g, but the previously synthesized 6-S-(2-S-pyridyl) nucleosides 7a-c as well, glycosylation reactions with the corresponding purine and pyrimidine bases and the 6-thiopyridine sugar 13 followed by direct deacetylation were employed.\n\nAll new compounds were well-characterized by NMR and UV spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. The 1 H NMR data obtained for the newly synthesized 5a-e revealed that these compounds had the b configuration (J 1 0 ,2 0 ) 8.0 Yz). It must also be mentioned that the desired compounds 5a-e, showed strong infra-red absorptions at 1750 cm \u00c01 (OAc) and 1697 cm \u00c01 (SAc), while in their 1 H NMR spectra prominent 3-proton methyl signals appeared, which were ascribed to the acetylthio moiety and 6-proton methyl peaks, which correspond to the acetoxyl group. Moreover, data in the 1 H NMR spectra, obtained for the newly synthesized 6-S-(2-S-pyridyl) nucleosides 7a-c,f,g, revealed the absence of 6-proton methyl peaks, which correspond to the acetoxyl group and the presence of 2-S-pyridyl moiety, whose proton peaks appeared between 8.4 and 7.1 ppm.\n\nThe stability of the target compounds was assigned after 3 months storage, either in organic solution or in solid phase, by performing NMR spectroscopy. Comparison of the primarily NMR spectra of the target molecules with those of the same storable compounds could clearly reveal identical proton NMR spectra.\n\nCompounds 6a-c and 7b,c,f,g were evaluated for their antiviral activity against a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) ( were also examined for their cytostatic activity against murine leukemia L1210, murine mammary carcinoma FM3A, human lymphocyte Molt4/C8 and CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells. Compounds 3a-g (Table 1 ) and the acetyl-substituted 5a-e analogs (data not shown) did not show appreciable antiproliferative activity. Likewise, the 6,6-disulfide glucopyranosyl pyrimidine dinucleoside derivatives 6a-c did not show appreciable cytostatic action against the evaluated tumor cell lines (IC 50 : 71 to >500 lM) (Table   1 ). However, their corresponding 2-S-pyridyl 6-thioglucopyranosyl mononucleosides 7 were endowed with a more pronounced cytostatic activity in cell culture. In particular, the 5-fluorouracil (7c) and especially the uracil (7b) derivative showed considerable cytostatic potency against the murine L1210, and human Molt4/C8, CEM and HeLa cells. Also, 7c and 7b were cytostatic against proliferating human embryonic lung HEL fibroblasts (IC 50 : 36 lM and 9.2 lM, respectively), Crandell feline kidney cells (CRFK) (IC 50 : 6.2 and 39 lM) and canine Madin-Darby kidney cells (MDCK) (IC 50 : 50 lM and 11 lM, respectively). Conversely, the adenine (7g) and cytosine (7f) derivatives showed poor, if any cytostatic activity (192 \u00c0 >500 lM) ( Table 1) . It is somewhat intriguing that among the 2-S-pyridyl 6-thioglucopyranosyl mononucleotides, only the derivatives containing an uracil/5-fluorouracil base were markedly more cytostatic than those, which bear a thymine, cytosine or adenine base. The fluorouracil derivatives proved equally cytostatic against murine and human cells, as well as against leukemia, mammary carcinoma, cervix carcinoma and lymphoma tumor cells. The molecular basis of the antiproliferative activity of the fluorouracil derivatives is currently unknown. When compounds 7b and 7c were exposed to purified recombinant thymidine phosphorylase (TPase) or uridine phosphorylase type I (UPase), they were not hydrolyzed to the free pyrimidine base under conditions where thymidine (exposed to TPase) and uridine (exposed to UPase) were readily converted to thymine and uracil, respectively (data not shown). These findings indicate that these molecules exert their potency via their intact nucleoside moiety (or anabolite derived thereof), rather than a catabolic metabolite (i.e. free 2-S-pyridyl 6-thioglucopyranose). Also, it is clear from the inactivity of the 3a-g series of compounds that the 2-S-pyridyl group plays an important role, in concert with the uracil base, to express pronounced cytostatic activity. In fact, Decout has recently reported on 2 0 ,3 0 -dideoxyribonucleoside 3 0 -disulfides [22] and found that those derivatives, which contain a rather bulky moiety on the disulfide part of the molecule (i.e. nitrophenyl, butyl, hexyl, actyl) were also most cytostatic than others. This is in agreement with the presence of a rather bulky entity on the disulfide in compounds 7b and 7c as well. The exact molecular mechanism of cytostatic activity is currently subjected to further studies. Mutatis mutandis, compounds 7b and 7c could be viewed as potential lead compounds for further modification in order to redesign and synthesize more potent cytostatic agents.\n\nWe have prepared a series of 2-S-pyridyl-6-thionucleosides, bearing natural and modified purines and pyrimidines, by developing highly efficient synthetic routes. None of the new compounds showed antiviral potency at subtoxic concentrations, but compound 7c, and in particular 7b, were endowed with significant cytostatic potency and can be viewed as novel lead compounds for further modifications. It would therefore be interesting to further explore the structure-activity relationships by modifying the base part as well as the sugar portion by incorporating different chemical entities."}
