{"title": "DIAGNOSTIC DILEMMA A Fall in Ghana", "body": "Upon admission to the ICU, the patient's temperature was 102.9\u00b0F (39.4\u00b0C). He was tachypneic, with a respiratory rate of 47 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 96% on 100% oxygen via a non-rebreather mask. His heart rate was 116 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 90/50 mm Hg. He was somnolent but appropriately conversant. Lung examination revealed accessory respiratory muscle use, diffuse rales, and bibasilar lung crackles. Cardiac, abdominal, and neurological exams were unremarkable. Scleral icterus was noted, but the patient had no rash or skin lesions. Initial laboratory results were significant for thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, renal insufficiency, and hepatitis ( Table 1) .\n\nThe patient's progressive respiratory failure required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Continuous infusion of norepinephrine was initiated for persistent hypotension despite adequate volume resuscitation. Pulse contour analysis of a good-quality invasive radial arterial pulse tracing showed a cardiac index of 5.1 and a systemic vascular resistance of 631 dyn \u00b7 sec \u00b7 cm \u03ea5 . Computed tomography of the chest disclosed no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Bilateral diffuse infiltrates with dense alveolar consolidations in the dependent areas were consistent with a diagnosis of adult respiratory distress syndrome ( Figure 1 ).\n\nEmpiric antibiotic coverage with doxycycline, meropenem, levofloxacin, vancomycin, atovaquone/proguanil, oseltamivir, and quinine was administered. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage showed normal airways and turbid lavage fluid with a white blood cell count of 960 \u03eb 10 3 cells/mm 3 and a normal differential cell count. Gramstaining of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed no organisms. A peripheral malaria smear was negative, as was a Binax NOW immunochromatographic assay. Further microbiologic studies are summarized in Table 2 . Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography indicated nonspecific dif-fuse bowel-wall thickening and mesenteric lymphadenopathy; a complete abdominal ultrasound examination was unremarkable. Computed tomography of the head was normal. A lumbar puncture yielded normal results.\n\nAcute febrile illness and rapidly progressive cardiopulmonary failure in a previously healthy 34-year-old man generated a broad differential diagnosis focusing on infectious causes (Table 3) . Annually, 4 million travelers become ill enough to seek health care abroad or upon returning home. 1 The GeoSentinel database, a network of 30 specialized clinics on 6 continents, provides information regarding the association between travel destination and the probability of clinical diagnoses. 1 Malaria is the most frequent cause of systemic febrile illness among sick travelers; several reports note adult respiratory distress syndrome as a complication. Furthermore, rickettsial infections can be complicated by adult respiratory distress syndrome.

A diagnosis of typhoid fever associated with adult respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was made.\n\nTyphoid fever is an acute systemic disease caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with Salmonella enterica, serotype Typhi or Paratyphi. Typically, after an asymptomatic period of 7-14 days (range, 3-60 days), the onset of bacteremia is marked by fever and malaise. 2 Patients typically present with influenza-like symptoms and few physical signs. 3 It is estimated that 21 million cases of typhoid fever arise annually worldwide; 90% occur in Asia. 2 In the US, about 500 cases per year are reported, and 75% are associated with foreign travel. 4 There is a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Severe typhoid fever is defined as fever plus delirium, stupor, coma (in Greek, typhus means \"fog\"), or shock and is associated with fatality rates of 44-56%. 5 Many complications of typhoid fever have been described (Table 4) . Although cough is a common symptom, occurring in 11-86% of cases, pulmonary complications of typhoid fever are rare, documented in only 1-6% of cases. 6 Reported pulmonary manifestations include bronchitis, pneumonia, lung abscess, pleural effusion, and empyema, yet sputum cultures are usually negative. 4, 6 Adult respiratory distress syndrome is a very rare complication of typhoid fever, which is surprising, given the bacteremia and endotoxinemia associated with the disease. To our knowledge, only 5 cases are reported in the literature. 7 However, in a report on 5 fatal cases of typhoid fever, features of adult respiratory distress syndrome were dis-covered on autopsy in 3 cases, suggesting that the disorder might be underreported. 8 The standard diagnostic method is blood culture, positive in 60-80% of patients. Bone marrow cultures are more sensitive, with \u054685% of infected patients testing positive. Stool culture sensitivity is about 30%. Serologic testing, the Widal's test, is controversial due to varying sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values in different geographic areas. 9\n\nRandomized controlled trials indicate that fluoroquinolones are the most effective typhoid fever treatment. 9 In severe typhoid fever, fluoroquinolones should initially be given intravenously, and treatment should last for at least 10 days. Furthermore, patients with delirium, stupor or coma, and shock might benefit from the prompt administration of dexamethasone. In a randomized double-blind trial involving 38 patients in Indonesia with severe typhoid fever, mortality was decreased from 50% to 10% (P \u03ed .003) when high-dose dexamethasone was administered (3 mg/kg over 30 minutes, followed by 1 mg/kg every 6 hours for 8 doses). 3 Lower dosages of steroids were not found to be effective. 5 Chronic biliary carriage might occur in 2-5% of cases even after treatment and can last as long as a year. In that situation, antibiotic therapy might be necessary; cholecystectomy also might be necessary if gallstones are present.\n\nThe cumulative efficacy at 3 years for Ty21a, an attenuated live vaccine, and the Vi typhoid vaccine, which is based on the purified capsular polysaccharide, are similar at 51% and 55% respectively, but, as was the case with our patient, who received the polysaccharide vaccine, the agents do not guarantee protection. 10 Our patient was treated with a 14-day course of levofloxacin. He did not have neuropsychiatric symptoms, and his shock resolved within 24 hours, so he was not treated with dexamethasone. He remained in the ICU for 11 days, was extubated on day 6, and was discharged to rehabilitation on hospital day 16. By discharge, all of his laboratory abnormalities had resolved, and a repeated stool culture showed no evidence of Salmonella paratyphi. In summary, typhoid fever should be considered as a possible diagnosis in patients with an acute febrile illness and rapidly progressive cardiopulmonary failure, especially for patients who have traveled from endemic regions."}
