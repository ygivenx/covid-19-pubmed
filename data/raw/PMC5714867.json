{"title": "M(IL-4) Tissue Macrophages Support Efficient Interferon-Gamma Production in Antigen-Specific CD8+ T Cells with Reduced Proliferative Capacity", "body": "Tissue macrophages (M\u03a6) comprise an important member of the mononuclear phagocyte system where they regulate inflammation, cancer, and autoimmunity (1). They are involved in innate and adaptive immune responses to invading pathogens (2), and adapt their phenotype and function in accordance with their environment through a process termed M\u03a6 polarization (3\u20135). It is now understood that both tissue M\u03a6 and bone marrow (BM)-M\u03a6 can develop into pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2) (6\u20138).\n\nM1 or M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) activation occurs in response to interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) in combination with bacterial moieties, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (9, 10). M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) M\u03a6 exhibit elevated secretion levels of nitric oxide (NO), and pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2 (11). Phenotypically, M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells express major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II, and the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 (6) to stimulate CD4+ T-cell proliferation (6, 12). M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells have been studied for their anti-bacterial, anti-viral immunity (13\u201317).\n\nOn the other hand, M2 cells are subdivided into M2a, M2b, M2c, and M2d depending on their environmental stimulus. The most studied subclass, M2a, is induced with interleukin IL-4 or IL-13 (9, 10). M2a or M(IL-4) M\u03a6 upregulate Arginase-1 expression (11), and express high levels of mannose receptor (CD206) and chitinase-3-like protein 3 (Chi3l3) (6, 18). As such, M(IL-4) M\u03a6 are widely considered regulatory and reparative cells (19). However, unchecked expansion of M2 M\u03a6 can cause severe pathologies (19). For example, during chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, circulating and liver monocytes convert to an M2-like state resulting in fibrosis development (20). It is therefore important to study M\u03a6 polarization during virus infection as a strategy to unlock M\u03a6 targeting therapeutics to limit virus-associated damage (17).\n\nDuring lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection (LCMV), M\u03a6 support viral replication, process, and present viral antigens to activate CD8+ T cells (21\u201326). Activated CD8+ T cells proliferate, gradually acquire cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) effector function and home to the site of infection to secrete IFN-\u03b3 and lyse virally infected upon recognition of viral epitopes on MHC-I (27). It is known that M(IL-4) peritoneal M\u03a6 and BM-M\u03a6 inhibit OT-II proliferation in a signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-6-dependent fashion (28). Moreover, in a murine norovirus infection model, helminth-induced M2 cells inhibit CD8+ T-cell proliferation (29). Yet, how polarized M\u03a6 engage CD8+ T cells to control proliferation and functions during RNA virus infection remains unexplored. Here, we report on a novel finding supporting a dichotomized regulatory role of M(IL-4) tissue M\u03a6 where they can inhibit CD8+ T-cell proliferation without affecting their IFN-\u03b3 production after peptide-specific antigen presentation.\n\nNitrite and urea production are known to be effective functional measures of M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) and M(IL-4) polarization, respectively (6, 8). Therefore, to demonstrate plasticity of Sp-M\u03a6, we characterized the biochemical properties profiles of polarized BM-M\u03a6 and Sp-M\u03a6 following IFN-\u03b3 (16 h) + LPS (8 h) or IL-4 stimulation (24 h). In agreement with previous publications, BM-M\u03a6 and Sp-M\u03a6 induce significant nitrite production after M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) stimulating conditions (Figure 1A: left panel), while producing urea following IL-4 treatment (Figure 1A: right panel) confirming previous published data (6, 8). Thus, both BM-M\u03a6 and tissue-derived Sp-M\u03a6 show similar biochemical profiles when polarized into M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) and M(IL-4) status as reported previously (8).\n\nProfessional antigen presenting cells (pAPC) such as M\u03a6 are needed for the activation of adaptive immune cells (30), as they are involved in antigen presentation via both MHC-I and MHC-II as well as their expression of costimulatory molecules (31). Nevertheless, LCMV has evolved mechanisms to interrupt APC activation and costimulatory molecule expression (32). Therefore, in order to assess the ability of polarized Sp-M\u03a6 to engage CD8+ T-cell receptors, we characterized surface expression of activated Sp-M\u03a6 markers following 24 h of LCMV infection (Figure 1B). With regard to CD80 expression, M0 and M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells increased surface levels following viral infection, while M(IL-4) cells expression of CD80 remained largely unchanged (column 1). Interestingly, M0 cells slightly decreased CD86 expression following LCMV infection compared with M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) and M(IL-4) cells where no change was detected (column 2). M0 cells exhibited slight MHC-I reduction but not M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) or M(IL-4) Sp-M\u03a6 (column 3). In addition, we also assessed expression of the inhibitory molecule PD-L1 (column 4). We observed that M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells expressed the greatest levels of PD-L1, while M0 and M(IL-4) had similar expression levels, which confirmed data in BM-M\u03a6 published by another group (33). LCMV infection increased expression of PD-L1 in M0 and M(IL-4), while reduced expression in M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) Sp-M\u03a6. These data demonstrate that polarized cells are not negatively affected by LCMV infection when considering CD80/86 or MHC-I expression, while LCMV increases inhibitory molecule PD-L1 expression in M2 and M0 cells, but not M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3).\n\nTo characterize further the functional profile of polarized cells, we investigated the release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in uninfected and LCMV-infected (24 h) Sp-M\u03a6. As expected, for the secretion of the cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 (Figure 1C), M0 and M(IL-4) cells were poor, while M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) stimulation produced substantial levels agreeing with what has been described previously (34). Interestingly, 24 h post-LCMV infection, M0 and M(IL-4) cells both significantly increased production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Moreover, M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells had reduced production of TNF-\u03b1 after infection but were still producing significantly higher amounts than M0 and M(IL-4). No changes in IL-6 secretion were observed with M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) after the infection.\n\nLymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection significantly decreased production of IL-12p40, in M0 and M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells while the opposite is true for M(IL-4), where production levels increased. Collectively, these data point to LCMV-promoting M(IL-4) cells to acquire a mixed M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3)/M(IL-4) phenotype considering the ability to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines post-infection. For the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, LCMV infection increased secretion in all subsets; however, M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) and M(IL-4) produced substantially less amounts than M0 infected cells (Figure 1C).\n\nHaving observed substantial levels of MHC-I expression on all M\u03a6, we questioned to what extent polarized M\u03a6 can bind and present MHC-I peptides. For this, we utilized the 25-D1.16 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the SIINFEKL peptide only when bound to H2-Kb MHC-I (p:MHC) (35). Representative staining of unpulsed and SIINFEKL-pulsed all M\u03a6 (1 h) histograms depicted in Figure 2A demonstrate that each population of Sp-M\u03a6 are able to display p:MHC on their surface. Measuring the fold change in mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) over unpulsed controls revealed M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) were best at binding and presenting the peptide and that Sp-M(IL-4) cells were the least efficient (Figure 2B). This suggests that the polarized all M\u03a6 subsets should be able to present H2-Kb restricted epitopes to CD8+ T cells to varying degrees.\n\nBased on the above observations (Figures 2A,B), we reasoned that this would translate to differential abilities to activate CD8+ T cells by the M\u03a6 population. To test this, we employed the CD8+ T-cell hybridoma system for which inducible Lac-Z is under the NFAT enhancer that binds the IL-2 promoter (36, 37). In this system, SIINFEKL-Kb-specific TCR ligation results in binding to the IL-2 promotor and expression of downstream Lac-Z that can be detected by colorimetric changes (38). Using two different concentrations of the SIINFEKL peptide (10\u22127 and 10\u22129 M), we observed that M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) M\u03a6 populations elicited B3Z activation better than M0 and M(IL-4) (Figure 2C). Yet, M(IL-4) were still very proficient in activating B3Z T cells indicating that M(IL-4) cells retain sufficient antigen presentation capabilities that was close to M0 cells.\n\nRecently, it was shown that splenic marginal zone M\u03a6 are responsible for activating an LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells when left unprimed by DC (39). Therefore, we extended our testing into the LCMV system, which includes H2-Kb and H2-Db binding epitopes in H-2b mice (40). Polarized Sp-M\u03a6 were pulsed with either GP33-41 or NP396-404 then cocultured with splenocytes isolated from LCMV-infected mice (2 \u00d7 105 pfu i.p.), 8 days post-infection. The ability of virus-specific CD8+ T cells to produce IFN-\u03b3 after in vitro re-stimulation with the ICS assay was used to assess the polarized Sp-M\u03a6 antigen presentation functions (Figure 3).\n\nWe found that the percentage of IFN-\u03b3 antigen-specific CD8+ T cells remained constant irrespective of M\u03a6 activation status (Figures 3A,B). Moreover, in agreement with immunodominance hierarchy reported for this model (41), there was a greater percentage of IFN-\u03b3-secreting GP33-41-specific CD8+ T cells than NP396-404 T cells (Figures 3A,B). This finding was identical irrespective of the activation M\u03a6 state even at low-peptide concentrations of 10\u22129 M. We further tested IFN-\u03b3 induction in LCMV-memory-specific CD8+ T cells using the LCMV GP33-41 peptide. After ex vivo stimulation by GP33-41 pulsed M\u03a6, we found that M(IL-4) cells were able to elicit similar activation of the memory T cells compared with M0 (data not shown). Therefore, we were able to demonstrate that M(IL-4)-M\u03a6 polarization does not negatively influence their ability to stimulate activation and release of IFN-\u03b3 from antigen-specific effector or memory CD8+ T cells after virus infection.\n\nTo assess whether the functional abilities with regard to antigen presentation were retained by the M\u03a6 during viral infection, we infected Sp-M\u03a6 with LCMV (MOI 5), and assessed their ability to present LCMV antigens to epitope-specific CTL. It was clear from the data (Figure 4A) that LCMV was to infect the polarized M\u03a6 in vitro and initiate its replication cycle as evident by LCMV-NP detection 24 h post-infection (Figure 4A). This protein was not detected immediately during the first hour of infection and needed to accumulate for approximately 8 h post-infection to be detected at significant levels due to the increased number of copies as a result of viral replication (data not shown), confirming our previous published data (42). Notably, we detected a reduction in LCMV-NP expression in M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) polarized cells compared with M0 and M2 (Figure 4A) indicating that M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells were likely inhibiting viral replication as described elsewhere.\n\nAfter 24 h of LCMV infection, we assessed the antigen presenting capacity of polarized M\u03a6 compared with M0 to epitope-specific CTLs. From the data shown in (Figures 4B,C), M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells activated GP33-41- and NP396-404-specific CTLs to levels similar to M0 and M(IL-4) cells. Thus, to our surprise M(IL-4) cells were very potent stimulators IFN-\u03b3 release from both GP33-41- and NP396-404-specific CD8+ T cells following viral infection. Thus, despite the prevailing dogma of M(IL-4) M\u03a6 perceived to be poor antigen presenting cells when interacting with CD8+ T cells, we discovered that they were proficient in presenting either peptides or processing viral antigens in different model systems.\n\nUpon successful activation, na\u00efve CD8+ T cells undergo an estimated 104- to 105-fold expansion at their peak proliferation during activation (43). Other groups have demonstrated that M(IL-4) M\u03a6 inhibit antigen-specific T-cell proliferation (28, 29). These publications utilized culture systems with M(IL-4) BM-M\u03a6 and na\u00efve P14 CD8+ T cells (specific for GP33-41) or anti-TCR and anti-CD28 antibodies to artificially stimulate na\u00efve CD8+ T-cell proliferation in an antigen-independent fashion proliferation (28, 29). However, how M(IL-4) cells direct memory recall responses is unknown. Therefore, we asked how CD8 T cells from LCMV memory, non-transgenic mice would respond to antigen presentation by polarized Sp-M\u03a6. To assess this, we cultured peptide-pulsed either polarized or unstimulated Sp-M\u03a6 with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labeled splenocytes from LCMV immune WT mice in the absence or presence of IL-2 (Figures 5A,B). Without exogenous IL-2 added to cultures, all the three M\u03a6 populations failed to induce recall proliferation in vitro (data not shown), confirming previously published data by other groups (44). We then increased IL-2 culture concentrations to determine the minimum threshold of exogenous IL-2 required for T-cell expansion. At 5 U/mL, M0 and M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) M\u03a6 induced 40 and 60% CD8+ T-cell proliferation, respectively (Figures 5A,B). In contrast, M(IL-4) induced the lowest proliferation (20%) by antigen-specific CD8+ T cells (Figures 5A,B).\n\nWe were able to restore the deficit in the stimulation ability of M(IL-4) cells by increasing the IL-2 levels in the culture system to 20 U/mL. This finding was not restricted to a single specificity of epitope-specific T cells, as both GP33-41- and NP396-404-specific T cells proliferated to similar levels when comparing M(IL-4) with either M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) or M0 (Figures 5C,D). Collectively, the data from Figures 2\u20135 demonstrate that although M(IL-4) cells are proficient at presenting antigens to CD8+ T cell and stimulate them to elicit IFN-\u03b3 release either as effector, memory cells, M(IL-4)-M\u03a6 were poor inducers of their if IL-2 is not present at sufficient quantities in the environment.\n\nFrom our observations above, we noted that although CD8+ T-cell proliferation was impaired compared with M0 and M(IL-4), approximately 20\u201330% of CD8+ T cell were still proliferating after peptide antigen presentation with M(IL-4) M\u03a6 (Figure 5B). As CD8+ T cells proliferate, they progressively acquire CTL functions (45). To test whether the epitope-specific CD8+ T cells were fully functional after the expansion period, we restimulated the expanded T cells using a common (BMA) M\u03a6 cell line as antigen presenting cells so that the only variable factor in the assay would be the expansion difference of the Sp-M\u03a6 (23, 42, 46).\n\nConsequently, we cocultured the cells in vitro for 6 days using 5 U/mL IL-2 because this was the concentration at which we observed minimal M(IL-4)-induced CTL expansion (Figure 5A). We then tested for IFN-\u03b3 production by ICS as described earlier, but this time using the BMA cell line as APC to present the LCMV peptide to T cells (Figure 6A).\n\nM0 and M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3)-expanded CTL were ~60% IFN-\u03b3 positive, whereas M(IL-4)-expanded CTL displayed lower level of ~30%. This indicates that in addition to M(IL-4) cells being poor expanders of CD8+ T cells, the CTLs that were able to expand were not potent effector cells. Upon increasing culture conditions to 10 U/mL of IL-2 (Figure 6B), we noted a partial restoration (an increase of approximately 10%) of IFN-\u03b3 production by CD8+ T cells cocultured with the M(IL-4) stimulators. This finding suggests that exogenous IL-2 can overcome stimulatory deficits in M(IL-4) cells, implying that M(IL-4) cells can dampen the proliferation and subsequent cytokine synthesis in CD8+ T cells through antigen presentation when IL-2 levels are low or limiting in the environment.\n\nCD4+ T helper cells play an important role in shaping efficient CTL, CD8+ T-cell memory, and recall responses (47). Evidence suggests that for efficient CD8+ T-cell responses to occur, the APC must be helped by CD4+ T cells (48). In particular, direct engagement between CD40 and CD40L activates APC to enable IL-2 production for memory CD8+ T-cell proliferation (49). Given that IL-2 rescued CD8+ T-cell proliferation in M(IL-4) M\u03a6 cultures in our experimental model, we reasoned that activated CD4+ T from an in vivo LCMV infection would compensate for the M(IL-4) ability to support CD8+ T cells in our model when the exogenous IL-2 levels are limiting in culture.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we sorted CD4+ T cells from LCMV-infected mice on day 4 because it has been shown that CD69 expression levels are near their peak after virus infection in vivo (50). We cocultured the sorted CD4+ T cells with the M\u03a6 plus CD8+ T cells during the CFSE proliferation assays in our model, when exogenous IL-2 levels are limiting. Although we observed that addition of CD4+ T cells enhanced the ability of M0 cells to increase CD8+ T-cell proliferation (from 38 to 50%), there was no positive influence in the M(IL-4) cultures (Figure 7) possibly because they may require additional help. Interestingly, no further proliferation (60%) was noted with M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells when we included the helper cells, indicating that a possible maximum proliferation had already been reached at such IL-2 levels without the CD4+ T cells present in the culture.\n\nIt is now understood that polarized M\u03a6 can modulate the outcome of infection and play a role in exacerbating or combating multiple diseases (4, 10). We previously reported that M-CSF induces in vitro differentiation of Sp-M\u03a6 into cells that resemble splenic red pulp M\u03a6 (23, 51). Further characterization revealed that Sp-M\u03a6 are effective antigen presenting cells capable of direct and cross presentation (23). Additionally, mature Sp-M\u03a6 remain plastic and can be induced to M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) and M(IL-4) phenotypes, similar to BM-M\u03a6 (8).\n\nSeveral groups have reported on the ability of M(IL-4) polarized cells to negatively regulate CD4+ T cells (6, 9, 28, 52\u201354). In addition, M(IL-4)-polarized BM cells were shown to inhibit CD3/CD28-activated na\u00efve CD8+ T-cell proliferation, and impair proliferation of na\u00efve LCMV-specific transgenic (P14) CD8+ T cells in a helminth/norovirus coinfection model (28, 29). However, not much is known regarding how polarized M\u03a6 influence antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell IFN-\u03b3 secretion and memory CD8+ T-cell recall responses after antigen presentation has ensued, particularly during viral infection. To this end, using the well-defined LCMV model, our study uncovers a dichotomous effect of M(IL-4) M\u03a6 on CD8+ T-cell proliferation and effector molecule release.\n\nWe demonstrate that polarized M(IL-4) M\u03a6 present MHC-I-restricted peptides to activate CD8+ T cells and stimulate IFN-\u03b3 expression. LCMV infected all three subsets of M\u03a6 as detected by LCMV-NP expression 24 h post-infection. However, we observed a substantial reduction of LCMV-NP in M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) cells. This is likely owing to the upregulation IFN-\u03b3-induced anti-viral genes inhibiting the replication of capacity of LCMV described (55). M(IL-4) cells effectively processed and presented de novo synthesized antigens to activate GP33-41- and NP396-404-specific CTL. However, when polarized cells were cultured with splenocytes cells from LCMV-immune mice, M(IL-4) cells stimulated the lowest level of CD8+ T-cell proliferation, a deficit that was overridden by increasing the levels of exogenous IL-2 added to the culture system. Collectively, these observations highlight how polarized M\u03a6 modify CD8+ T-cell function and are of particular importance to the design of cell-based immunotherapies.\n\nThe suppressive effects of M(IL-4) M\u03a6 on T-cell proliferation have been reported in the literature where M(IL-4) cells prevented proliferation of EL4 and D10.G4 T cells through an undefined cell-contact-dependent mechanism during nematode infection (52). Subsequent gene analysis revealed several M(IL-4)-specific markers including program death ligand (PD-L2), resistin like molecule (RELM)-\u03b1 and YM-1, regulating CD4+ T-cell and CD8+ T-cell proliferation (28, 29, 54). Moreover, in vitro M(IL-4) M\u03a6 express high levels of Arginase-1 and can also interrupt TCR signaling through l-arginine deprivation (56). For instance, coculture of M(IL-4) M\u03a6 with Jurkat T cells or spleen T cells for 24 h resulted in the downregulation of CD3\u03b6 T-cell surface expression and inhibition of CD4+ T-cell proliferation (56\u201358). Moreover, l-arginine deprivation yields a G0\u2013G1 arrest by preventing increases of cyclin D3 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) levels (58). Thus, M(IL-4) cells have the ability to modulate T-cell proliferation by contact-dependent and contact-independent mechanisms.\n\nIn our system, we observed a significant reduction of antigen-specific memory CD8+ T-cell proliferation when stimulated with M(IL-4) cells compared with M0 or M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) when employing IL-2 at limiting concentrations. Interestingly, supplementing the coculture medium with additional IL-2 restored CD8+ T-cell proliferation and subsequent IFN-\u03b3 secretion upon restimulation. The most likely explanation for this finding is likely due to the ability of IL-2 to tune TCR sensitivity and regulate cell-cycle progression. With regard to TCR sensitivity, exogenous IL-2 restores basally depressed CD3\u03b6 expression in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (59). Moreover, it was recently demonstrated that IL-2 reduces the threshold of activation in CD8+ T cells promoting responsiveness to low antigen levels (60). Therefore, by adding IL-2 we ostensibly improved the TCR sensitivity to antigen. In terms of cell cycle, IL-2 enhances expression of cyclin D3 and CDK4, and activates CDK2 promoting cell-cycle progression into S phase (61, 62). Therefore, it is plausible that additional IL-2 overrides the M(IL-4) cell-induced CD8+ T-cell impairments by increasing CD3\u03b6 expression and promoting entrance into cell cycle. In agreement with this notion, delivery of IL-2 complexed to anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibody breaks established CD8+ T-cell tolerance in an FBL model of murine leukemia (63). As such, future research into the biological mechanisms of our reported novel finding that IL-2 can overcome M(IL-4) stimulatory deficits CD8+ T cell is of immense interest to the immunotherapy field.\n\nAnother novel finding that is reported here is the ability of the polarized M\u03a6 to elicit IFN-\u03b3 production by antigen-specific CTL following peptide stimulation or LCMV infection. Given the impairment of CD8+ T-cell TCR signaling described above following M(IL-4) coculture, we anticipated M(IL-4) cells to poorly induce IFN-\u03b3 secretion from CTL (57, 59). A limitation of these studies was that they did not address the consequence of short-term (<24 h) M(IL-4) M\u03a6\u2013T-cell interactions on CD3\u03b6 expression (57, 59). However, the duration of our cytokine detection assays (approximately 6 h) allows us to separate the short-term and long-term impacts of M(IL-4) cells on CD8+ T-cell effector function and memory CD8+ T-cell proliferative response.\n\nIn our system, the observed ability of M(IL-4) cells to stimulate CTL IFN-\u03b3 release is likely attributed to the lower threshold of CTL activation for cytokine production compared with proliferation (64). It was previously demonstrated that low concentrations of TCR ligands result in IFN-\u03b3, but not IL-2 production nor proliferation in CD4+ T cells (64). However, as ligand concentration increases, so does the diversity of cytokine response and proliferation levels (64, 65). This implies that additional characteristic of polyfunctional CD8+ T cells requires a successive increase in signaling threshold. Conceptually, this might serve as a safeguard to control against unwanted CD8+ T-cell effector activity and cytokine production.\n\nIn summary, our results uncover a previously unknown ability of M(IL-4) cells to induce IFN-\u03b3 secretion by CTL and yet negatively regulate memory CD8+ T-cell proliferation compared with other forms of M\u03a6 employed in this study. Thus, it is plausible that M(IL-4) cells possess novel undefined characteristics that need to be uncovered regarding how they may regulate immunity during infections.\n\nC57BL/6 (H-2b) mice (6\u20138 weeks) were purchased from (Jackson Laboratories) and were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions. Animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Canadian Council of Animal Use and with approval from Queen\u2019s University Animal Care Committee. The BMA cell line BMA3.1A7 (a gift from Dr. K. Rock, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, USA) is an adherent murine M\u03a6 cell line generated from the BM of female C57BL/6 mice by overexpressing myc and raf oncogenes and has recently been characterized by our group to be a good model to study M\u03a6 polarization (66, 67). For viral infections, mice were injected at indicated plaque forming units (PFUs) or LCMV-WE intraperitoneal in 200 \u00b5L of sterile PBS.\n\nBone marrow-M\u03a6 and Sp-M\u03a6 were generated as previously described (8, 23, 51). Briefly, cells (for both BM-M\u03a6 and Sp-M\u03a6) were cultured in 6 well plates (Corning) with conditioned RPMI 1640 (Gibco) medium (CM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Fisher Scientific), M-CSF media and 50 \u00b5g/mL gentamycin. On days 3 and 5 of culturing, non-adherent cells were removed and fresh CM was added. Sp-M\u03a6 and BM-M\u03a6 were cultured for 6\u20137 days in total before activation and testing for their functions as described below. For M(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) M\u03a6: cells were primed with IFN-\u03b3 (25 ng/mL for 16\u201318 h; Shenandoah Biotechnology) followed by Escherichia coli LPS (O55:B5, 100 ng/mL for 6 h; Sigma-Aldrich). To induce M(IL-4) M\u03a6, polarization cells were treated with rIL-4 (20 ng/mL for 18\u201324 h; Shenandoah Biotechnology). Unstimulated control M\u03a6 (M0) were placed in RPMI 10% FCS for 18\u201324 h.\n\nM(LPS + IFN-\u03b3) polarization was determined by assessing NO production using Griess reagent as published previously (8, 24). M\u03a6 (200,000 cells/well) were seeded in a round-bottom 96-well plate and activated in phenol-red free RPMI, where nitrite concentration was determined by measuring OD at 540 nm using the Varioskan microplate reader. Sodium nitrite was used for the standard graph (0\u2013100 \u00b5M) to calculate nitrite concentrations in the test samples and was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Whitby, ON, Canada).\n\nM(IL-4) polarization was assessed by arginase activity as described (8, 68). Activated M\u03a6 were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.1% Triton-X, 25-mM Tris\u2013Cl, pH 8.0) purchased from Sigma (Oakville, ON, Canada) and incubated for 30 min at 4\u00b0C followed by centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. Protein content in supernatant was determined using Bradford reagent (Bioshop) and sample concentrations were equalized to 100 \u00b5g/mL. For the reaction, 100 \u00b5L of sample was added to 1.5-mL eppendorfs followed by 10 \u03bcL of 10-mM MnCl2 an incubation at a 55\u00b0C for 10 min. 100 \u00b5L 0.5-M l-arginine solution (pH 9.7) was then added before incubation for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. To stop the reaction, 800 \u00b5L of acid solution (7:3:1; H2O:H2PO4, 85%: H2SO4, 95%) and 40 \u00b5L of \u03b1-isonitrosopropiophenone (ISPF) (9% w/v in absolute ethanol) were added. Samples were heated at 100\u00b0C for 30 min and urea concentration was determined with the help of a urea standard graph (0\u201325 M) by measuring OD at 550 nm using a Varioskan spectrophotometric microplate reader.\n\nUninfected or LCMV-infected (MOI 3: 24 h) were seeded at 2\u20133 \u00d7 106 cells/mL into 6-well plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. After incubation, ELISAs were performed on collected supernatants. The levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, and TNF-\u03b1 were measured in accordance with R&D systems manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n\nTotal RNA was extracted from primary, LCMV-infected cells using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc.). RT reaction was carried out using RT master mix with reagents obtained from Froggabio (North York, ON, Canada). PCR was performed using Taq 5X Master Mix (Froggabio) and the following primers (Forward and Reverse) obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coraville, IA, USA) for LCMV Nucleoprotein (F: 5\u2032-TCC ATG AGA GCA CAG TGC GGG GTG AT-3\u2032, R: 5\u2032-GCA TGG GAG AAC ACG ACA ATT GAC C-3\u2032) and 18S control (F:5\u2032-AAACGGCTACCACATCCAAG-3\u2032, R: 5\u2032-CCTCCAATGGATCCTCGTTA-3\u2032).\n\nCells were stained with a combination of surface marker antibodies detailed below. Primary direct staining was performed with antibodies purchased from Biolegend: FITC anti-CD86, clone RMMP-2; FITC anti-MHC-II (I-A/I-E), clone M5/114.15.2; FITC anti-CD25, clone 3C7; PE anti-MHC-I, clone AF6-88.5; PE Biotin anti-CD80, clone 1610A1; PE anti-PDL1, clone 10F.9G2; PE anti-CD137, clone 17B5; APC/Cy7 anti-CD69, clone H1.2F3. For indirect staining antibodies were purchased from Biolegend: Biotin anti-IFN-\u03b3, clone XMG1.2; from eBioscience: Biotin anti-SIINFEKL/H2-Kb, clone 25-D1.16. Here, applicable cells were stained with secondary Streptavidin-FITC (Invitrogen) or FITC anti-rat IgG, clone Poly4054 (Biolegend). Staining was carried out for 20\u201330 min at 4\u00b0C in FACS buffer containing 0.5% sodium azide in PBS. Samples were acquired using the Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA) and analyzed using FlowJo software. Fold change in MFI was calculated by using the following formula: fold change = [(SIINFEKL MFI \u2212 Negative MFI)/Negative MFI], where \u201cSIINFEKL\u201d refers to cells that were pulsed with SIINFEKL peptide and \u201cNegative\u201d refers to unpulsed cells.\n\nPeptide-specific short-term T-cell lines were generated as previously described (23, 24, 42, 46). Splenocytes isolated from LCMV immune mice (30 days post-infection) were subjected to ficoll-gradient lymphocyte enrichment. Enriched T cells were cocultured with \u03b3-irradiated peptide-loaded (GP33-41, NP396-404; 10\u22127M) BMA at a ratio of 10:1 in RPMI (10% FCS, 50-\u00b5M \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 20 U/mL rIL-2, 50-\u00b5g/mL gentamycin). After 5 days, medium was isolated and ficolled to remove dead APC and enriched cells were re-seeded in a new 6-well plate with fresh medium for 2\u20133 days before use.\n\nIn order to compare direct antigen presentation by activated M\u03a6, we utilized LCMV-specific T cells, either in vitro generated LCMV CTL or the B3Z hybridoma T cells. For ex vivo stimulation of LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells by polarized M\u03a6, splenocytes isolated from an LCMV-infected mouse on day 8 and were restimulated with GP33-41 or NP396-404 (10\u22127 M) peptide-pulsed M\u03a6 (ratio of 10 splenocytes: 1 APC) for 2 h. ICS for IFN-\u03b3 production was then performed as described below. LCMV-specific CTL were cultured with activated M\u03a6 (1:1) that were pulsed with decreased peptide molarity (GP33-41/NP396-404: 10\u22127 to 10\u22129 M) or infected with LCMV-WE (MOI 3 or 5) for various time points for 4 h in the presence of Brefeldin A (10 \u00b5g/mL; Sigma-Aldrich).\n\nB3Z CD8+ T-cell hybridoma cell line specific for OVA residues 257\u2013264 (SIINFEKL) presented on murine MHC-I (H2-Kb) was also used (36, 69). Cells were cultured in IMDM medium containing 500 \u00b5g/mL G418 to ensure positive selection of reporter cells until time of experiment. For antigen presentation assays, APC were pulsed with SIINFEKL peptide (10\u22127 or 10\u22129M) at 37\u00b0C for 2 h before extensive washing in warm PBS. Thereafter, the APC were cocultured with B3Z in a 96-well round-bottom plate (Thermo Scientific) at a ratio of 1:1 for 18 h in IMDM medium (5% FCS) at 37\u00b0C. For Laz-Z detection, Z Buffer (150 \u00b5L), containing 0.125% NP-40, 9-mM MgCl2, 100 mM of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and 5-mM ONPG, was added to the B3Z:APC cell pellets and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 h to allow for colorimetric change. Thereafter, 100 \u00b5L of buffer was transferred to a flat-bottom 96-well plate for absorbance measurement at 410 nm using a Varioskan plate reader.\n\nFor LCMV-NP detection, infected cells were fixed and permeabilized with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% saponin for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in PBS with 0.25% saponin and incubated for 1 h with rat anti-LCMV-NP Ab (clone VL4) supernatants (a gift from Dr. M. Groettrup, University of Constance, Germany) to detect NP expression (70). After washing twice, FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG Ab (Invitrogen) was incubated with the cells overnight at 4\u00b0C. In separate experiments, propidium idodide (1 \u00b5g/mL; Sigma Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada) was added to uninfected and LCMV-infected samples for assessment of cell death. Data were acquired with the Epics XL MCL (Beckman) and analyzed with the FlowJo software.\n\nSplenocytes were harvested from LCMV-WE immune (30 days post-infection) and lymphocytes were purified by ficoll-gradient centrifugation with lymphocytes separation medium (Fisher, Whitby, ON, Canada). Purified cells were labeled with CFSE (0.4 \u00b5M) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C then washed twice in warm PBS. Lymphocytes were cultured in a 96-well flat-bottomed plate with GP33-41 or NP396-41 peptide pulsed polarized M\u03a6 for 3\u20136 days (at decreasing concentrations of recombinant IL-2) before staining for CD3 and CD8\u03b1 expression and assessed for CFSE staining by FCM. Percent proliferation was determined by calculating the % of CD8+ CFSELow cells compared with unstimulated CFSE labeled controls (CFSEHi). For the CD4+ T-cell coculture experiment: CD4+ T cells were negatively selected for by gating out B220+, CD11b+, F480+, and CD8+ cells from the spleen using a BD FACS Aria III sorter (Beckman-Dickinson). CD4+ T cells were added to M\u03a6+ CFSE labeled splenocyte at the indicated ratio and incubated for 4 days.\n\nStatistical analysis was performed using Prism 7.0 (La Jolla, CA, USA) with unpaired (Student\u2019s) t-test.\n\nMice were used according to Canadian Council of Animal Care guidelines to isolate primary cells and the protocol for this work was approved by the Office of University Animal Care Committee at Queen\u2019s University (Protocol no. 1536).\n\nSB and RM contributed to the design of the project and writing of the paper.
