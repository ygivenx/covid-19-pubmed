{"title": "Serum-dependent and independent regulation of PARP2", "body": ", these studies confirm that PARP2 is not 68 entirely functionally redundant with PARP1. Furthermore, they underscore the importance 69 of PARP2 in maintaining a number of key cellular physiological processes. For these 70 reasons, we sought to investigate the mechanism by which PARP2 is regulated under 71 normal and stress-induced conditions. 72\n\nTo investigate how PARP2 is regulated, a survey of several cell lines showed robust 73 7 COS-7, MCF-7, HeLa, NIH3T3, MEF F20 and IMCD cells were maintained in 117 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12 or DMEM supplemented with 10% 118 FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37\u00baC. Cells were 119 treated with different protease inhibitors at the concentration and duration as indicated in 120 the figures. Cells were subject to serum starvation or maintained in medium containing 121 different concentrations of sera where stated. Transfections were carried out using X-122 tremeGENE 9 transfection reagent as per manufacturer's recommendation. To test if the 123 loss of the PARP2 signal on blots under serum starvation conditions was due to 124 sequestration rather than degradation, MCF-7 cells were cultured to approximately 90% 125 confluence in complete medium (CM) and then this was removed and replaced with serum-126 free (SF) medium containing 50\u00b5gml -1 cycloheximide (CHX) to inhibit protein synthesis. 127\n\nThe cells were incubated for 7hr, and then the medium replaced with CM containing 128 50\u00b5gml -1 CHX. The cells were cultured for 1hr and then lysed in Laemmli sample buffer.

PCR products were resolved on 141 1% agarose gels and images captured with a FluorChem IS-8900 Imager ( (Fig. 1) . 231\n\nThe loss of the PARP2 signal in cells cultured in SF medium was not due to cell 232 death as within one hour, when cultured in CM, these previously serum-starved COS-7 233 cells had reacquired a PARP2 signal (Fig. 1B) . Furthermore, signals were comparable to 234 those in cells that had been continually growing in CM. These results showing that PARP2 235 All rights reserved.

To address whether or not serum had an 237 effect on altering the activity of the PARP2 gene, and specifically the SRE in its promoter, 238 MCF-7 cells were cultured in CM or SF medium for 30 minutes and then total RNA was 239 extracted and used for cDNA synthesis. Endpoint and quantitative RT-PCR using PARP2 240 primers showed that PARP2 mRNA was available regardless of the treatment (Fig. 1C, D) . 241\n\nHowever, immunoblot analysis showed PARP2 signals in cells cultured in CM, but not in 242 those that were cultured in SF medium (Fig. 1E) . Together these observations indicating that PARP2 expression was not affected by 251 serum deprivation brought into question the significance of the putative SRE. More 252 importantly, they strongly suggested that the loss of PARP2 signals could be the 253 consequence of the accelerated degradation of the protein itself or its sequestration to a 254 compartment resistant to Laemmli extraction buffer following serum starvation. To test the 255 latter, 2% SDS and 8M urea lysis buffers were used to lyse NIH3T3 cells cultured under 256 CM or SF conditions.

Although no putative sites were identified in PARP2, COS-265 7 cells were cultured in CM and protein turnover examined when translation was blocked 266 using cycloheximide (CHX). Cells were cultured in the presence of CHX (50\u00b5gml -1 ) for 1, 267 3, 5 and 7hr, and then processed for immunoblot analysis to detect PARP2 ( Fig. 2A) . 268\n\nContrary to the rapid disappearance seen in SF culture, PARP2 appeared stable over the 269 7hr period. Similar results were seen for PARP1 and ERK, which together would indicate 270 that the loss of the PARP2 signals was serum-dependent. 271\n\nThe loss of the 62kDa PARP2 signal in cells cultured in SF medium prompted us 272 to undertake a more detailed investigation on the relationship between serum treatment and 273 the levels of PARP2 (Fig. 2B ). COS-7 cells were cultured in SF medium or in medium 274 containing increasing amounts of serum. Immunoblot analysis showed a similar staining 275 pattern for full-length PARP1 and its C-terminal fragment, regardless of whether serum 276 was present or not (Fig. 2B ). In contrast, increasing the serum concentration from 0 to 10% 277 resulted in the significant increase in the appearance of PARP2 (P<0.05; Fig. 2B ). Together 278 these results showed that PARP2, but not PARP1, changes in cells in response to serum. 279 Furthermore, the evidence with that seen in figures 1C and 1D, would suggest that this 280 increase is at the protein level rather than due to increased gene activity. 281\n\nHaving determined that PARP2 was available as an SDS soluble protein and this 282 was dependent on the presence of serum, the next question was to address how fast the 283 PARP2 signal would decline when cells were deprived of serum. To determine this, COS-284 7 cells were cultured in CM for 24hr until 90% confluence, and then the medium was 285 removed and replaced with SF medium. Cell lysates were collected at 15, 30, 45 and 60 286 minutes and then processed for immunoblot analysis with the H-250 PARP antibody. 287\n\nResults showed PARP1 levels were unaffected by the serum conditions, and comparable 288 signals were seen in all lanes (Fig. 2C ). In contrast, PARP2 signals were absent within 15 289 minutes after serum deprivation (Fig. 2C ). This finding suggested serum starvation 290 activated an efficient mechanism to reduce the PARP2 signal, which could be either 291 proteolytic degradation or sequestration to an insoluble fraction. inhibitors were comparable to those in cells cultured in CM. The PARP2 signal, however, 302 All rights reserved.

These results, together 303 with those seen in figure 1A , led us to dismiss the notion that the decline in PARP2 levels 304 in cells growing in SF medium was a caspase-dependent, apoptotic-related event. 305\n\nSince the caspase inhibitors had no effect on preventing the disappearance of the 306 PARP2 signal when cells were deprived of serum, the next step was to broaden the search 307 for other proteases that might be involved in the process. MEF F20 (PARP1 +/+ ) cells were 308 selected for these studies since the Yucatan PARP2 antibody provided little to no consistent 309 signal with human PARP2 but is robust in detecting mouse PARP2 (data not shown). 310\n\nFurthermore, comparable levels of PARP2 were observed between F20, COS-7 and MCF-311 7 cells (data not shown). F20 cells were cultured in CM until 90% confluence and then 312 pretreated with 250\u00b5M leupeptin (LEU), 30\u00b5M pepstatin A methyl ester (PME), 30\u00b5M 313 calpeptin (CAL), or 50\u00b5gml -1 \u03b1-2-macroglobulin (\u03b12-M). After 5hr, the medium was 314 replaced with SF medium containing the corresponding protease inhibitor. To inactivate a 315 broad spectrum of endo-and exopeptidases, cells were treated with the 1x HALT Protease 316\n\nInhibitor Cocktail, which contains AEBSF-HCl, aprotinin, bestatin, E-64, leupeptin, 317 pepstatin A and EDTA. After a 15-minute incubation, cell lysates were collected and 318 processed for immunoblot analysis with the Yucatan PARP2 antibody. Results showed that 319 the inhibitors, either alone or in a cocktail (HALT), were not effective in preventing the 320 disappearance of the PARP2 signal (Fig. 3B ). This led us to conclude that under serum 321 deprivation, PARP2 levels were not affected by an amino, serine, cysteine, metallo-and 322 aspartic acid protease. After exhausting a broad spectrum of candidate proteases thought 323 to be responsible for degrading PARP2, our attention turned to the ubiquitin-proteasome 324 system (UPS). 325 All rights reserved.

Thus, when serum was present, 349 exogenously expressed PARP2 was ubiquitinated and despite being a long-lived protein 350 under these conditions ( Fig. 2A) The data also points to the fact that different mechanisms of PARP2 regulation exist and 368 that these processes are activated in a manner that depends on the conditions under which 369 the cells are cultured. 370 371 All rights reserved.

If PARP2 was degraded rather than being 376 sequestered after serum withdrawal, then it was expected that the signals would not 377 reappear, as indicated in figure 1B, after serum was added and protein synthesis inhibited 378 with CHX. 379\n\nImmunoblot analysis with a PARP2 antibody (Axxora) showed, as expected, the 380 62kDA PARP2 signal in cells cultured in CM (Fig. 6A , lane 1). The PARP2 signal was 381 lost when serum was removed and remained so in cells cultured in SF medium and treated 382 with CHX (Fig. 6A, lanes 2 and 3, respectively) . Similarly, CHX had no apparent effect on 383 PARP2 when cells were cultured in CM (Fig. 6A, lane 4) . However, when cells were 384 treated with CHX, and cultured under serum-free conditions, were transferred to CM 385 containing CHX, the PARP2 signal appeared (Fig. 6A, lane 5) . In fact, the signal strength 386 was almost identical to cells cultured without CHX (Fig. 6A, lane 6) . These results would 387 suggest serum starvation led to the sequestration of PARP2 to an SDS-(and urea) insoluble 388 compartment, which could recycle back to a soluble form when serum was present. To 389 further understand the capacity of this sequestration, we overexpressed GST-PARP2 in 390 MCF-7 cells cultured in CM or SF medium for 15, 30 and 60 minutes. Immunoblot analysis 391 of these lysates, using a GST antibody, showed that the GST-PARP2 signal was 392 comparable between the cells cultured in CM and SF medium (arrow, Fig. 6B ). Lower 393 molecular weight signals were also seen on blots (arrowheads, Fig. 6B ), and although not 394 All rights reserved.

Thus, the evidence would suggest that either the 396 sequestration capacity was limiting, or the GST tag conferred solubility to PARP2, either 397 way with most of the ectopically expressed PARP2 free in the SDS-soluble fraction. 398\n\nTogether, the results indicate that serum withdrawal does not lead to PARP2 degradation.

To investigate this, we cultured different cell lines in 418 the presence or absence of serum and then assayed PARP2 levels. The loss of the PARP2 419 signal in cells cultured in SF medium (Fig. 1A) , and its return when serum was replaced 420 (Fig. 1B) supported the notion that the PARP2 gene was serum responsive. Given this on-421 off appearance at the protein level, and the presence of the putative SRE, we had expected 422 to see changes in PARP2 mRNA expression under the different culturing conditions. This, 423 however, was not the case and the presence of a PARP2 amplicon in cells cultured in the 424 SF medium indicated that the message was available (Fig. 1C) . Furthermore, the fact that 425 the quantitative-RT-PCR results showed no significant differences in expression in cells 426 cultured under the different conditions (Fig. 1D) indicated that the regulation of PARP2 in 427 cells deprived of serum was not due to the direct regulation of the gene, at least within the 428 time frame of our investigation. Thus, the presence of PARP2 mRNA under the SF 429 conditions did not seem to contribute to the fast return (within one hour) of the PARP2 430 signal after serum was added to cells incubated in CHX to block new protein synthesis (Fig.  431   6A) . Also, the reappearance of the PARP2 signal when serum was added was dose-432 dependent (Fig. 2B) and not reliant on increased transcription that was dependent on the 433 putative SRE in the PARP2 promoter (Fig. 1D) . These results implied that PARP2 under 434 serum-free conditions was either being rapidly degraded (Fig. 2C) proteases at the forefront of candidates responsible for the serum-dependent changes seen 442 with the different cell types (Fig. 1) . Unfortunately, our analysis using a caspase-specific 443 and a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor (Fig. 3A ) as well as a proteolytic inhibitor cocktail 444 (Fig. 3B ) ruled out the possibility that caspases were responsible for the proteolysis. 445 Subsequent experiments were designed to explore the ability of serine, cysteine, metallo-446 and aspartic proteases to alter PARP2 levels (Fig. 3B) . As with the caspase inhibitors, those 447 routinely employed to prevent proteolysis did not have an effect on the PARP2 signals 448 when cells were cultured in serum-free conditions (Fig. 3B) . Furthermore, the reports that 449 the cysteine protease cathepsin L is present in the nucleus, like PARP2, and is involved in Thus, despite the link between serum starvation to activate the DNA damage response 486 All rights reserved.

It is unlikely, however, 511 that the loss or sequestration of PARP2 is a mechanism to prepare it for autophagic 512 degradation since inhibiting lysosomal enzymes with leupeptin had no apparent effect (Fig.  513   3B ). Serum deprivation and the way cells cope, however, is indicative of a stress response, 514 and although our results suggest that PARP2 participates in these events, it does not explain 515 why the protein cannot be detected following urea denaturation (Fig. 1F) . Urea is often 516 used to recover proteins from inclusion bodies (Burgess 2009), but there is no single 517 method of solubilization for every protein (Singh et al. 2015) . 518\n\nGiven the shortcomings on being unable to find a sequestration mechanism noted 519 above, our data does indicate that PARP2 is degraded through the UPS in cells when serum 520 is present (Fig. 5B) (Fig. 5A) , where cells should have retained some of the PARP2 protein when they 543 were transferred to serum-free medium. 544\n\nIn summary, PARP2 was shown to be a long-lived protein that is continually 545 degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system in cells cultured in medium containing serum. 546\n\nHowever, in the case of a cell stress response when serum is removed, PARP2, through an 547 unknown mechanism, is no longer in a SDS or urea soluble form, and it is not known if 548 this is a prelude to apoptosis or to some other physiological requirement. Nevertheless, 549 alleviating this cellular stress by the addition of serum recycles PARP2 to a form, thereby 550 allowing it to resume its enzymatic role involved in the pARylation of target substrates. 551 All rights reserved.

PARP2 maintains genomic stability by recruiting DNA repair machinery to sites of DNA damage (1), and when not required is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (2).
