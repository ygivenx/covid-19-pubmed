{"title": "Quantitative Temporal\nin Vivo Proteomics Deciphers\nthe Transition of Virus-Driven Myeloid Cells into M2 Macrophages", "body": "Myeloid immune cell populations are phenotypically\ndynamic and\narise from a common pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell lineage. Following\ninfection, bone marrow (BM)-emigrating immature monocytic myeloid\ncells\u2014identified in mice as CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6C+ cells\u2014are recruited to the site of infection\nand mediate antimicrobial, as well as inflammatory, functions. Importantly,\nsite-specific environmental cues dictate the functionality and cellular\nphenotype of these myeloid cells, ranging from pro-inflammatory to\nimmunosuppressive. It is hypothesized that, through a temporal transition,\nthese inflammatory immature myeloid cells differentiate into monocytes\nand macrophages that acquire specific phenotypes, functionalities,\nand metabolic profiles throughout infection. Such plasticity permits\nthese myeloid cells to be associated with a plethora of pathological\nconditions including pathogenic infections,1\u22123 inflammatory\ndiseases/responses,4,5 cancer progression,6\u22129 and antitumor immune responses.10\n\nFollowing infection, recruitment and transition of inflammatory\nCD11b+, Ly6C+ cells are instrumental in L. monocytogenes,2K.\npneumoniae,1 and influenza virus\nclearance.11 Although the exact mechanism\nof how inflammatory CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6C+ cells contribute to pathogenic clearance is unclear, it is\napparent that these cells are pivotal in both innate immunity as well\nas adaptive immunity.1,12 Thus, an in depth examination\nof their transitory, temporal, and stage-specific phenotype is necessary\nto understand the role and function of virus-driven inflammatory myeloid\ncells.\n\nChanges in immune cell functions during infections are\ndependent\non dynamic proteomic changes over time. Notwithstanding previous technological\nchallenges, comprehensive and temporal characterization of proteomes\nto understand cellular function is now possible due to recent advancements\nin multiplex quantitative proteomics.13,14 Combined with\nnovel synchronous precursor selection with three-stage mass spectrometry\n(SPS-MS3) acquisition methods, extremely precise measurements of cellular\nproteomes are now possible.15,16 Although proteomic\nanalysis has previously captured single time point \u201csnapshots\u201d\nof in vivo cell populations, in vivo dynamics of immune cell populations\nhave not been explored. Here, we report a quantitative temporal in\nvivo proteomics (QTiPs) approach, which combines SPS-MS3-based 10-plex\nquantitative proteomics with flow cytometry-based cell sorting to\nprecisely capture temporospatial proteomic changes of newly recruited,\ntransitory CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells during reovirus infection.\n\nReovirus is a benign, enteric,\nhuman dsRNA virus that drives an\nacute viral infection and is readily cleared through an immunocompetent\nhost.17 In addition to its use as a model\nof acute infection, reovirus is known for its potent preferential\ncancer-killing (also known as oncolytic) activities and is being tested\nas a therapeutic oncolytic virus in phase I, II, and III clinical\ntrials internationally for the treatment of a variety of tumors.18\u221223 In this context, it is now clear that immunological events initiated\nfollowing the administration of reovirus in immunocompetent hosts\nare the indispensable part of reovirus-based cancer therapy. Thus,\nthe detailed understanding of immunological events initiated following\nviral infection is pertinent to the therapeutic effectiveness of oncolytic\nvirus-based cancer immunotherapy.24,25 Thus, using\nQTiPs combined with phenotypic, transcriptional, functional, and metabolic\nvalidations, we illustrate a temporal transition of reovirus-driven\nCD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6C+ cells\nfrom their role in innate antiviral immune response (CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh cells) to their acquisition\nof M2-like macrophage phenotype (CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Clow cells) during viral infection. Our QTiPs approach\nreports a novel platform to elucidate in depth, quantitative, temporospatial\ncellular transitions in the context of various pathophysiological\nconditions in situ. Our QTiPs approach reports a novel platform to\nelucidate in depth, quantitative, temporospatial cellular transitions\nin the context of various pathophysiological conditions in situ.\n\nThe following reagents used\nwere purchased from Biolegend (San Diego, CA): FITC-antimouse Ly6G\n(1A8), Alexa Fluor 647-antimouse Ly6G (1A8), PE-antimouse Ly6C (Hk1.1),\nAPC-antimouse Ly6C (Hk1.1), Alexa Fluor 647-antimouse CD206 (C068C2),\nPerCP/Cy5.5-antimouse CD11b (M1/70), Alexa Fluor 647-antimouse MHC-11\n(I-A/I-E) (M5/114.15.2), and PE-antimouse H.2kb bound to SIINFEKL\n(25-D1.16). Antimouse CD16/32 (93) and APC-antimouse CCR2 (cat# FAB5538a)\nwere purchased from BioXCell (West Lebanon, NH) and R&D Systems\n(Minneapolis, MN), respectively. Metabolic stains, DAF-FM diacetate\n(4-amino-5-methylamino-2\u2032,7\u2032-difluorofluorescein diacetate)\n(D23844), and CM-H2DCFDA (C6827) were purchased from Molecular Probes\n(Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Rochford, IL, USA).\n\nIn vivo experimental procedures were\napproved by the Dalhousie University Animal Ethics Committee in accordance\nwith the regulations/guidelines from the Canadian Council on Animal\nCare (CCAC) (project numbers 14-086 and 16-107). C57BL/6 mice were\npurchased from Charles River Laboratory (Montreal, Quebec, Canada),\nand CCR2KO and C57BL/6-GFP mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory\n(Bar Harbor, ME).\n\nAnimals were\ninjected with reovirus as previously described,26,27 and inflammatory myeloid cells were collected from the site of infection\nas well as bone marrow on 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 days postinfection (d.p.i.).\nHarvested cells were collected and stained as previously described26 and sorted using a FACSAria III (BD Biosciences),\nresulting in \u223c95% purity. Isolated cells were washed with PBS,\npelleted, and lysed in 6 M guanidine-HCl, 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.5, containing\nRoche complete mini protease inhibitor mixture (1 tablet per 10 mL)\n(Roche, Madison, WI). Lysis was performed via sonication and cleared\nby centrifugation. Cysteine residues were reduced using 5 mM dithiothreitol\nand then alkylated with 14 mM iodoacetamide. Aliquots containing 50\n\u03bcg of protein were diluted to 1.5 M guanidine-HCl, 50 mM HEPES\n(pH 8.5) and digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). Digested\npeptides were desalted using 60 mg solid-phase C18-extraction cartridges\n(Waters, Milford, MA), lyophilized, and labeled using TMT 10-plex\nreagents as described previously.28 Samples\nwere then mixed equally, desalted using solid-phase C18 extraction\ncartridges (Waters, Milford, MA), and lyophilized.\n\nTMT10-labeled\nsamples were fractionated using high-pH reversed phase chromatography\nperformed with an Onyx monolithic 100 \u00d7 4.6 mm C18 column (Phenomenex,\nTorrance, CA). The flow rate was 800 \u03bcL/min, and a gradient\nof 5\u201340% acetonitrile (10 mM ammonium formate, pH 8) was applied\nover 60 min using an Agilent 1100 pump (Agilent) from which 12 fractions\nwere collected. Fractions were desalted using homemade Stage Tips,29 lyophilized, and analyzed with an Orbitrap Fusion\nmass spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Rochford, IL) using the\nSPS-MS3 method as described previously.28,29 Protein identification\nwas performed using a database search against a mouse proteome database\n(downloaded from UniProtKB in September 2014) concatenated to a mammalian\northoreovirus 3 (Dearing strain) database (downloaded from UniProtKB\nin September 2014). All false discovery rate (FDR) filtering and protein\nquantitation was performed as previously described.28 A protein was required to have a minimum total signal-to-noise\nof 100 in all TMT reporter channels, and the maximum number of missing\nchannels was equal to 8. Data for heat maps and individual protein\nprofiles are represented by relative intensity, which is based on\nthe summed signal-to-noise.\n\nGO-annotation analysis was originally\nconducted on the whole data\nset using the open access Gene Ontology Consortium.30,31 The data set was subsequently analyzed via k-means clustering with\nEuclidean distance using MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV)32 followed by DAVID Bioinformatics Resources (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) to conduct GO-term analysis for BPs, MFs, and cellular compartments\non specific clusters. Our total data set was utilized as the background\nfor the data analysis searches. For the indicated experiments, the\nInterferome Web site33 and MitoCarta database34,35 were utilized to cross-list for proteins associated with interferon\n(IFN) response and mitochondrial-associated proteins, respectively.\nInsertion of individual clusters into the Interferome search engine\nidentified IFN-associated proteins and classified such proteins into\ndifferent IFN types. The mass spectrometry proteomics data (Data S-1) have been deposited into ProteomeXchange\nConsortium36 via the PRIDE37 partner repository with the data set identifier PXD005064.\n\nFlow cytometry of harvested\nall immune cells from the spleen and bone marrow from independently\ncollected animals as previously described.26 Peritoneal cavity (PC) cells were harvested via a flush of the PC\nwith PBS. Flow cytometry for MHC-ova (SIINFEKL) was conducted by first\npulsing unlabeled immune cells harvested from the PC with SIINFEKL\npeptide (5 \u03bcg/mL) for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C in RPMI complete media\n(5% vol/vol Glutamax, 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS], 1\u00d7 sodium\npyruvate, 1\u00d7 nonessential amino acids, and 1\u00d7 Anti-Anti\n[Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA]). Harvested cells (PC, spleen, and BM)\nwere treated with RBC-lysing ammonium chloride (ACK) buffer, washed,\nand blocked with anti-CD16/32 antibody prior to primary antibody.\nFor metabolic stains (NO and ROS), cells were incubated with 2.5 \u03bcM\nDAF-FM diacetate (4-amino-5-methylamino-2\u2032,7\u2032-difluorofluorescein\ndiacetate) (D23844; Molecular Probes) or 2.5 \u03bcM CM-H2DCFDA (C6827;\nMolecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C in combination with antibodies\nin flow cytometry running buffer (PBS-EDTA with 1% FBS) (FACS buffer).\nCells harvested for flow cytometry, with the exception of DAF-FM-\nor DCF-stained cells, were fixed with 4% PFA, washed, and resuspended\nin FACS buffer prior to analysis. Flow cytometry data were collected\nusing a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Bioscience), and analysis was\nconducted with the use of CellQuest Pro (BD Bioscience) and FCS Express\nV3 software (DeNovo Software, Los Angeles, CA).\n\nReovirus (serotype\n3, Dearing strain) was cultured, amplified, and isolated using a previously\nestablished protocol.38 Reovirus was titered\non L929 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) by\nstandard plaque assay as described previously.27,39 L929 cells were cultured in minimum essential media with 5% vol/vol\nGlutamax, 5% fetal bovine serum, 1\u00d7 sodium pyruvate, 1\u00d7\nnonessential amino acids, and 1\u00d7 Anti-Anti (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,\nCA). To assess the intra- and extracellular virus from the (site of\ninfection) SOI, 5 mL of PBS was added to the peritoneal cavity. The\nresultant peritoneal flush was collected and spun down at 500g for 6 min to separate the cells (for analysis of intracellular\nvirus) from the extracellular fraction (containing the free extracellular\nvirus). Either sorted CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013,\nLy6Chigh-low cells or nonsorted cells (total heterogeneous\npopulation of cells) from such a peritoneal flush were lysed with\nRIPA buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholic\nacid, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA) to extract intracellular virus. To determine\nthe viral titer (plaque forming units/mL), L929 cells were infected\nwith a serial dilution of cell lysate or peritoneal flush supernatant.\nVirus titers were accessed 96 h post the initial L929 cell infection.\n\nRNA extractions, cDNA synthesis,\nand qPCR were conducted as previously described26 on independently collected samples. The indicated gene-specific\nprimers were purchased from Invitrogen. Data were analyzed using Livak\nand Schmittgen\u2019s 2\u2013\u0394\u0394CT method40 and normalized to Gapdh.\n\nSorted\ncells (5 \u00d7 105 cells), independently collected from\na pooled population of 5\u201310 mice, were resuspended in XF media\nand plated onto X24 Seahorse cell plates coated with Cell-Tak (Corning).\nOxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate\n(ECAR) were measured in XF assay media under basal conditions and\nin response to 1 \u03bcM oligomycin, 1.5 \u03bcM carbonyl cyanide\n4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP), 1 \u03bcM rotenone,\nand 1 \u03bcM antimycin A (all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, ON,\nCanada) on the XF24 extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience,\nBillerica, MA, USA). Basal OCR was calculated by subtraction of the\nresidual rate after antimycin A treatment. Maximal rate was calculated\nby subtraction of the residual rate after antimycin A treatment from\nFCCP-induced OCR. Proton leak was calculated as the difference between\nOCR after oligomycin treatment and OCR after antimycin A treatment.\nATP production was calculated by subtraction of OCR after oligomycin\ntreatment from basal OCR. Spare respiratory capacity was calculated\nby the difference between maximal OCR and basal OCR. Spare respiratory\ncapacity coupling efficiency was calculated by the dividend of basal\nOCR and ATP production. Glycolytic capacity was calculated as the\nECAR after oligomycin treatment. Glycolytic reserve was calculated\nby the difference between glycolytic capacity and ECAR. Glycolytic\nreserve percentage was calculated by the dividend of glycolytic capacity\nand ECAR.\n\nBone marrow cells were collected from femur and tibia bones and\ncultured\nfor 6\u20138 days in RPMI complete media supplemented with granulocyte\nmacrophage colony-stimulating factor (20 ng/mL for M1-like macrophages)\nor macrophage colony-stimulating factor (100 ng/mL for M2-like macrophages).\n\nDepending on the indicated experiment,\none-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test or a two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test with 95% confidence interval were used for statistical\nanalysis, and p values of <0.05 were considered\nsignificant. Asterisks were used to signify p values\nas not significant (ns) = p > 0.05, *p \u2264 0.05, **p \u2264 0.01, and ***p \u2264 0.001.\n\nExposure to pathogens,\nespecially viruses, drives the recruitment of CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh myeloid cells that undergo functional\ntransition at the site of infection. To directly visualize this transition\nof newly recruited, virus-induced myeloid cells in situ, we performed\n10-plex quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) on temporally collected,\ncell-sorted, reovirus-driven myeloid cells. Reovirus induces the accumulation\nof otherwise absent CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh cells at the site of infection as early as 1 d.p.i., which\nsubsequently exhibited a gradual loss of Ly6C expression over time\n(hence the reference to these cells as CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low; Figure 1A and Figure S-1A-B). These CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells were sorted from the site of infection (SOI, inflammatory)\nand the BM (resident) from 10 C57BL/6 mice per collection point. QTiPs\nanalysis identified 6634 proteins and quantified 5019 proteins from\nthe in vivo harvested and cell-sorted myeloid cell population spanning\nthe course of 10 days in both the SOI and BM (Figure 1B, Data S-1).\nComparing 10 to 1 d.p.i., SOI-isolated cells contained more proteomic\nchanges (>- or <2-fold) than in the BM myeloid cells (12.69\nvs\n5.46%, respectively) (Figure 1C). Because the QTiPs data set provides rich temporal proteomic\ndata, it can be interrogated further to reveal temporally distinct\nvirus-driven myeloid cell changes over the course of acute infection.\n\nBecause of the limited knowledge of the overall proteomic\nsignature\nof CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells, we first conducted GO annotation analysis30,31 of all identified proteins in our data set. The most represented\nbiological processes (BPs) were cellular (including cell cycle, proliferation,\nrecognition, and growth) and metabolic (including catabolic, biosynthetic,\nand coenzyme) processes pertaining to 33.6 and 20.7% of the overall\nannotation analysis, respectively (Figure 1D and Figure S-1C). As anticipated, we observed immune system-associated BPs (Figure 1D), which encompassed\nantigen processing/presentation, immune response, and macrophage activation\nBPs (Figure S-1C). Investigation of BP-associated\nproteins identified temporal differences between the SOI and BM. For\nexample, immune-associated proteins (complement C4-B, IFN-inducible\nGTPase 1, and activated macrophage/microglia WAP domain protein [WFDC17])\nwere predominantly higher in the SOI-isolated cells. Interestingly,\nunlike complement C4-B and IFN-inducible GTPase, which peak in relative\nabundance at 1 and 5 d.p.i., respectively. WFDC17 increased \u223c10-fold\nfrom 1 to 10 d.p.i., suggesting a time-dependent discrepancy in immune\nfunction (Figure 1E).\nAdditionally, numerous cell cycle-associated proteins (e.g., Retinoblastoma-like\nprotein 1) were more abundant in BM-isolated fractions, proposing\nthat cellular proliferation of these myeloid cells is greater in the\nBM. Because metabolic alterations can contribute to immune cell function/differentiation,\nwe inspected the data set for metabolic proteins and observed a 2.1-\nand 8.4-fold induction of lactate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase,\nrespectively, from 1 to 10 d.p.i. in SOI-isolated cells; however,\nno change was observed within the BM-isolated collections (Figure 1E). These changes\nsuggest that SOI-isolated cells develop a more Warburg-like metabolism\nat 7 and 10 d.p.i.. Collectively, our QTiPs approach successfully\ncaptured temporal, quantitative, and spatially comparable proteomes\nof transitory myeloid cells directly from their in situ microenvironment.\n\nTo understand\ndistinct functions of virus-driven CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh cells, we clustered\nthe data set using k-means clustering, revealing temporally distinct\npatterns of protein expression. Three of ten clusters contained proteins\nrepressed over the period of 1\u201310 d.p.i. (Figure S-2). GO annotation analysis using DAVID bioinformatics41,42 of cluster #1 (decreased expression patterns from 1 to 3 d.p.i.)\nshowed an over-representation of BPs corresponding to response to\ncytokine stimulus, humoral immune response, defense response (e.g.,\nIFIH1 and CCL2), and steroid metabolic processes (Figure 2A, B). Alongside these BPs,\nserine-type peptidase and endopeptidase inhibitor activity molecular\nfunctions (MFs) were over-represented within this cluster (e.g., ZP1\nand HRG). In cluster #2 (expression peak at 5 d.p.i.), we observed\nan over-representation of response to wounding, response to stimulus\n(hormone and positive regulation) (e.g., CCL7 and CCL12), and endopeptidase\ninhibitor activity (e.g., SPA3K and MUG1) (Figure 2C, D). These data suggest that SOI-isolated\ncells are early responders to viral infection. Furthermore, cluster\n#3 represented proteins with a general elevated relative intensity\nwithin SOI- vs BM-isolated cells. GO annotation of cluster #3 showed\nan over-representation of BP-associated categories for the response\nto virus (e.g., RSAD2 and toll-like receptor 3 [TLR3]), response to\nwounding, endocytosis, and antigen processing/presentation (e.g.,\nICAM1 and HA11) (Figure 2E, F). Specifically, cluster #3 contained hallmark viral infection-associated\nimmunological targets, such as 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate\nsynthase 1A (OAS1A), TLR3, TLR9, H-2 Class-I histocompatibility antigen,\n\u03b2-2-microglobulin, and ICAM1. Collectively, this analysis reveals\na time-dependent transition of inflammatory CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells and suggests a role\nfor inflammatory CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells in antiviral immunity.\n\nConsidering that reovirus\nexposure stimulates pattern recognition\nreceptors (PRRs), especially toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3), and produces\na type I IFN response, clusters #1\u20133 were additionally analyzed\nusing an Interferome database.33 This analysis\nrevealed profiles for numerous IFN-associated genes (e.g., ISG20,\nMPEG1, IFI5A, Q9DCE9, and IRG1) (Figure 3A\u2013C). Gene-specific RT-PCR amplification\nof Isg56, Cd40, Igtp, Serpina3k, Ccl7, Ifit3, Irgm1, Trafd1, and Ifi5a showed compatible mRNA expression trends with that of their respective\nprotein expression profiles from clusters #1\u20133 (Figure 3D). Importantly, temporal changes\nin IFN-associated protein expression were mostly within SOI-isolated\ncells as opposed to their BM-isolated counterparts. Categorizing these\nIFN-associated proteins into type I and II responses emphasizes a\npredominant type I IFN-response from SOI-isolated cells early following\ninfection in addition to a secondary elevation in type II IFN-associated\nproteins (shown in cluster #2) (Figure 3E). Together, these results suggest that CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells contribute\nto type I and type II IFN response following infection.\n\nOn the basis of the temporal IFN\nresponse associated with CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells,\nwe next sought to determine if they affect viral replication. First,\nwe investigated the viral titers of reovirus within CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells (intracellular)\nas well as those present within the SOI (extracellular). In congruence\nwith the reoviral lambda protein expression profile captured within\nthe QTiPs data (Figure 4A), plaque assay-based analysis for the intracellular and extracellular\nvirus showed the highest viral titers at 1 d.p.i. that steadily declined\nover the course of 10 days (Figure 4B, C). These data demonstrated the ability of inflammatory\nCD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells to harbor reovirus in a time-dependent manner. In the context\nof the proposed role for such myeloid cells as oncolytic virus carriers,43\u221245 these findings bear clinical relevance.\n\nBecause the SOI contains a diverse mixture of immune cells,\nwe\nwanted to delineate whether the CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells specifically affect viral persistence.\nFor this purpose, we used a well-documented CCR2 KO mouse model in\nwhich the trafficking of inflammatory myeloid cells from the BM to\nthe SOI is defective.2 Importantly, this\ncharacteristic of impaired trafficking of inflammatory myeloid cells\nin CCR2 KO mice is routinely used to identify the contribution of\nmyeloid cells during viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections.11,12,37,38 Thus, we first conducted comparative frequency/kinetic analysis\nof reovirus-driven CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 versus CCR2KO mice\nand showed a near absence of CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cell accumulation within the SOI of CCR2KO\nmice (Figure 4D), confirming\nthe requirement of CCR2 for the recruitment of CD11b+,\nLy6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells at the SOI.\nNo significant frequency/kinetics differences for these cells were\nobserved within the spleen and BM of WT vs CCR2KO mice (Figure S-3A). Furthermore, the comparative intracellular\nvirus load analysis on total SOI-collected immune cells illustrated\nsignificantly higher titer of replication-competent reovirus in CCR2KO\nmice (which contain a lower number of CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells) as compared to that\nof the WT mice (Figure 4E) and suggested an antiviral role for inflammatory myeloid cells.\nIt should also be noted that these inflammatory cells also contain\nthe known antiviral mediators including reactive oxygen species (ROS)\nand nitric oxide (NO), especially at 1 d.p.i. (Figure 4F). Together, these analyses validate the\nQTiPs-revealed role for CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells in viral clearance.\n\nA particularly\ninteresting cluster of proteins, showed delayed\n(7\u201310 d.p.i.) increased abundance in SOI- but not BM-isolated\nCD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells (Figure 5A,\ncluster #4). GO annotation of cluster #4 illustrated an increased\npeptidase activity (MF) within these cells during the later stages\nof infection, which included antigen processing/presentation-associated\nproteins, such as Cathepsin B (CATB) and Cathepsin D (CATD), that\nare essential to drive an effective adaptive immune response (Figure 5B, C).46 GO annotation also revealed an over-representation\nof MFs of the immune effector process, response to wounding (e.g.,\nPERF and ARGI1), homeostatic process, endocytosis, and major histocompatibility\ncomplex (MHC)-II antigen processing/presentation (e.g., MRC1 and HG2A)\nin SOI-isolated cells (Figure 5B, D). qRT-PCR-based validation of many of these targets showed\nconsistent temporal gene expression patterns for genes Mrc1, Pepd, H2-ab1, Cd74, Tpp1, and Lip1 (Figure S-3B). Together, the QTiPs suggested the acquisition\nof antigen-presentation capabilities by inflammatory CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells late during\ninfection.\n\nTo validate this hypothesis, we\nexamined MHC-II surface expression\non CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells during infection. Congruent with our proteomics data, these\ncells demonstrated higher surface expression of MHC-II at 7\u201310\nd.p.i. compared to those at 3 and 5 d.p.i.; however, it was interesting\nto note that these cells were initially recruited with elevated MHC-II\nexpression at 1 d.p.i. (Figure 5E). Finally, to demonstrate the antigen presentation capacity,\nwe monitored the ability of virus-driven CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells to present the immunodominant\nepitope of ovalbumin (OVA; peptide SIINFEKL) in the context of MHC-I.\nImportantly, CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells showed the highest capacity to present SIINFEKL\nat 7 d.p.i. (Figure 5F). Altogether, our data suggest that inflammatory CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells undergo\na phenotypic and functional transition to acquire enhanced antigen\nprocessing/presentation abilities during the later stage of infection.\n\nBecause of the connection between distinct metabolic pathways and\nmyeloid cell functional capacities, and based on the QTiPs-identified\ninduction of proteins regulating metabolism (e.g., LDHA), we also\nassessed the metabolic profiles of transitory CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells. Metabolic-associated\nproteins (indicated by BPs and cellular compartment GO annotation\nanalysis) were evident in cluster #5 with an increasing trend from\n1 to 10 d.p.i. in SOI-isolated cells (Figure S-4A\u2013C). We compared our QTiPs data set to the mouse MitoCarta2.0 data\nset34,35 to exclusively examine known mitochondrial\nproteins. Using k-means clustering, we subdivided the total mitochondria-associated\nproteomic data into various clusters (Mito-clusters #1\u201310; Figure 6A and Figure S-5). GO annotation analysis of Mito-clusters\n#1 and 2 showed an over-representation of proteins involved in cellular\nresponse to ROS, the fatty acid metabolic process, response to oxidative\nstress, and generation of precursor metabolites and energy (Figure S-6A). KEGG pathway analysis41,42 of Mito-clusters #1\u20132 showed an over-representation of fatty\nacid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and the citric acid cycle\n(Figure S-6A), and STRING network analysis47 further illustrated the interaction of these\npathways among all metabolic pathway-associated proteins (shown in\nred) within these clusters (Figure 6B). Individual protein profile analysis from Mito-clusters\n#1 and 2 of the citrate acid cycle, fatty acid metabolism, and oxidative\nphosphorylation revealed a general increasing trend from 1 to 10 d.p.i.\n(Figure 6C). These\nanalyses highlight the metabolic reprogramming of inflammatory CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells following\nviral infection.\n\nBecause the proteomic data suggested\na metabolic switch in SOI-isolated\nCD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells, especially at 7\u201310 d.p.i., we examined time-dependent\ncellular bioenergetics (mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis)\n(Figure 6D and Figure S-6B) in isolated CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells. As shown in Figure 6E and Figure S-6C, SOI isolated cells displayed the\nhighest basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR), ATP production (Figure S-6D), and proton leak (Figure S-6E) at 7 d.p.i., suggesting higher bioenergetic demand\nat 7 d.p.i.. Concurrently, basal extracellular acidification rate\n(ECAR) (Figure 6E and Figure S-6F) of isolated CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells were also greatest\nat 7\u201310 d.p.i. Importantly, the opposing trend was observed\nwith spare respiratory capacity (Figure 6F), maximal OCR (Figure S-6G), and glycolytic reserve (Figure 6G and Figure S-6H), indicating that these cells utilize glycolysis close to their\ntheoretical maximum at 7\u201310 d.p.i. These data show that inflammatory\nCD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells undergo metabolic reprogramming at the SOI and increase both\nglycolytic and respiratory capacities during the later stages of infection.\n\nIt has been hypothesized that immature myeloid cells give rise to\nantigen-presenting cells (APCs), especially those of monocytic lineage.48 Our data suggest that the virus-driven CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells undergo\ntemporal transformation and acquire molecular signatures of APCs.\nHence, we next investigated whether these myeloid cells differentiate\ninto any specific subtype of the APCs. The QTiPs data (Figure 7A) identified an increasing\ntrend for proteins (CCL24, ARG-1, Alox15, Stab1, and TGF-\u03b2)\ncharacteristic of M2 macrophages between 1 and 10 d.p.i. in SOI-isolated\nmyeloid cells. In contrast, M1-macrophage-associated proteins (IRF5,\nMMP9, and IRF1) showed the opposing trend (Figure 7B). In support of this, flow cytometry analysis\nof inflammatory CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells further identified contrasting kinetics for\nthe surface expression of M2 macrophage marker CD206 (increased over\ntime; Figure 7C) and\nM1 macrophage marker CCR2 (decreased over time; Figure 7D). In line with our metabolic bioenergetics,\nthese results reveal the transition of inflammatory CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells into M2-like\nmacrophages around 7\u201310 d.p.i.\n\nTo further strengthen our hypothesis that the inflammatory\nCD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells acquire\nM2-like macrophage characteristics, we performed qRT-PCR on SOI- and\nBM-isolated CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells. First, we analyzed the expression of key transcription factors Irf4 and Irf5 known to be involved in M2\nvs M1 macrophage polarization, respectively.49\u221251 As shown in Figure 7E and F, SOI-isolated\nmyeloid cells showed contrasting profiles of Irf4 and Irf5 between 1 and 10 d.p.i.; the levels of\nM2-macrophage transcription factor Irf4 increased\nover time, whereas Irf5 decreased over time. Furthermore,\nusing a list of M2 and M1 macrophage markers,52,53 we showed that M2-associated marker Ccl17 followed\na similar trend as Irf4 (Figure 7G), whereas additional M2-associated genes\n(Ym1, Cd206, and Il4) displayed mostly nonsignificant changes (Figure S-7A). Importantly, the expression of M1-associated markers\n(Cd86, Il-1\u03b2, Cd68, Socs1, Tnf\u03b1, and Ifn\u03b3) showed an opposing trend throughout infection\nwith decreasing expression from 1 to 10 d.p.i. (Figure 7H). Analysis of M2- and M1-associated genes\nin the BM-isolated cells showed little significant variation (Figure S-7B and C, respectively). These results,\nin combination with QTiPs analysis, conclusively demonstrate that\nthe virus-driven CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells undergo phenotypic and functional transition\nat the SOI and acquire the characteristics of M2 macrophages.\n\nMyeloid cells and their descendants, including monocytes, dendritic\ncells, macrophages, or myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), play\npivotal roles in both innate and adaptive immunity during infections.\nWith regard to viral infections, newly recruited Ly6Chigh monocytes have been implicated in viral clearance following infection\nwith West Nile virus, vaccinia virus, murine cytomegalovirus, and\ninfluenza virus.54\u221256 These studies demonstrate that viral-driven myeloid\ncells readily interact with other innate (NK cells) and adaptive cells\n(virus-specific CD8+ T cells)11,56 and contribute toward\nviral clearance as well as disease pathology through direct or indirect\nmechanisms. For instance, inflammatory myeloid cells recruited following\nmouse hepatitis virus (MHV) contribute toward virus clearance through\na CCR2-dependent mechanism.57 Furthermore,\ninfluenza-mediated CD11b+, Ly6Chigh cell recruitment\nis a major contributor to excessive collateral damage within the lungs,\nand the absence of such recruitment compromises viral clearance and\ndecreases the CD8+ T cell frequency.11 In\ncongruence with these reports, our data demonstrates that the recruitment\nof reovirus-driven CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh inflammatory cells is CCR2-dependent (Figure 4D) and that their presence\nat the SOI positively correlates with viral clearance (Figure 4E). Interestingly, at the SOI,\nintracellular virus be found within the cells with and without the\nCD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh phenotype\n(Figure 4E), suggesting\nthe involvement of other immune cells in antiviral immune reactivities.\nThus, it could be concluded that virus-driven CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh inflammatory cells, in combination\nwith other immune constituents, contribute toward virus clearance.\n\nHere, we provide the first comprehensive temporospatial quantitative\nproteomic analysis of inflammatory CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells directly isolated from their in situ\nmicroenvironment. Notably, our QTiPs approach accounts for host environmental\nfactors, such as cytokines, metabolic changes, and immune infiltrating/resident\ncells, at the SOI. In combination with detailed biological validation,\nthe QTiPs data show that reovirus-driven CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells have differential roles\nthroughout the course of infection: newly recruited CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh cells mount a robust\nimmune response and aid in viral clearance during the early phase\nof infection (1\u20135 d.p.i.), whereas during late phase infection\n(7 and 10 d.p.i.), these cells undergo a metabolic shift, acquire\nenhanced antigen-presentation capacity, and achieve M2-like macrophage\ncharacteristics.\n\nQuantitative multiplexed proteomic approaches\n(e.g., label-free,\ntags, or stable isotope labeling) represent an unbiased strategy to\nobserve global proteomic changes and answer key biological questions.\nWith respect to immunological studies, label-free quantitation has\nbeen the predominant means to investigate proteomic discrepancies\nof ex vivo expanded/cultured or transformed cell lines (e.g., cytotoxic\nT lymphocytes,58 dendritic cells, and/or\nmacrophages59\u221261), and primary-isolated cells such as dendritic cell\nsubsets,62 MDSCs,63 and human T cells.64 Unlike such label-free\napproaches, TMT reagents now facilitate simultaneous analysis of 10\nproteomes. Employing TMT in our QTiPs approach enabled accurate and\ndeep proteomic coverage of in vivo proteomic profiles of isolated\nCD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells. The temporal nature of the data set revealed a secondary\nphase of antiviral/wound damage response at 5 d.p.i. indicative of\nincreased type I and II IFN-associated proteins (e.g., IFI5A, IRF5,\nIRG1, and Q9DCE9, an IFN-\u03b3-induced GTPase). IFI5A in particular\nhas been shown to be a transcriptional regulatory factor induced during\nmyeloid cell development65 and may have\nimplications in CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cell differentiation at 5\u201310 d.p.i. Furthermore,\nlate stage variations illustrated in clusters #4 and 5 or Mito-clusters\n#1 and 2 correlate with increased antigen presentation/processing\nand metabolic shift, respectively. Such temporal fluctuations in the\nproteomes highlight the advantages of utilizing an approach that monitors\nthe in vivo dynamics of an immune cell population. Our QTiPs approach\nprovides a global, timely, and in depth platform facilitating the\ncapture of immune cell transitions while accounting for the interplay\nbetween cytokines and immune cells throughout the course of infection.\n\nConsidering the current contentious nomenclature and phenotypic\ncategorization around myeloid cells and its derivative subpopulations,52 we identified virus-driven murine myeloid cells\nsimply by their factual phenotype (based on CD11b, Ly6G, and Ly6C\nsurface expression). To this end, we viewed these myeloid cells as\na newly recruited cell population at the SOI and then analyzed their\ntransition into existing paradigmal subpopulations in terms of surface\nmarker, gene expression, protein, and metabolic profiles. Our temporal\nanalysis reveals that SOI-associated CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh cells undergo a time-dependent decrease in\nLy6C expression and display increased MHC-II expression and wound\nhealing characteristics at 7\u201310 d.p.i., suggesting maturation/differentiation\nduring the later stages of infection. Upon further dissection, we\nobserved that M2-macrophage-associated proteins and transcripts increase\nat 7\u201310 d.p.i. as opposed to pro-inflammatory/M1-macrophage-associated\nmarkers that are upregulated during the early stages of infection.\nSimilar to myeloid cells, there is a growing appreciation for the\nplasticity of the distinction between M1- vs M2-like macrophages.\nIt is now acknowledged that macrophages rather demonstrate a spectrum\nof phenotypic, functional, and physiological features of M1 and M2\nclasses and thus often display these features in a context-dependent\nmanner. It should be noted that many of the M1- or M2-associated features\nhave been originally discovered in the context of the macrophages\nthat were generated using defined in vitro growth conditions, such\nas through the supplementation of GM-CSF or M-CSF. Thus, it is possible\nthat cells differentiated in the context of the complex in vivo milieu\nhosting a myriad of soluble and cellular interacting partners bear\na differential pattern of M1 and M2 markers that is observed with\nthe in vitro-generated macrophages. In our analysis, virus-driven\nCD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh cells\nshow several M2-associated markers during the later phases of infection;\nhowever, at the same, these cells failed to show any congruent trends\nwith of Il4, Ym1, and Cd206 gene expression that have been described\nto be associated with the M2 phenotype. On the basis of these findings,\nwe surmise that the macrophages generated in a complex in vivo microenvironment\ndiffer from those generated in vitro using defined growth conditions\nand should be considered as such with a special consideration for\ntheir microenvironmental context.\n\nThe metabolic signature of\nmyeloid cells, particularly macrophages,\nis a major hallmark to distinguish contrasting M1 vs M2 macrophage\nphenotypes.66 In comparison to this existing\nparadigm and our own experiments with ex vivo-generated/cultured M1-\nand M2-like macrophages (Figure S-7D, E),66 we observed that CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells became more\nmetabolically active during the later stages of infection, as indicated\nby increasing basal OCR and basal ECAR (Figure 6D, E). Such a metabolic shift could be indicative\nof the necessity to require energy for newly acquired endocytic, antigen\npresentation, and/or M2-like functionality. In the context of currently\nreported metabolic profiles assigned to M1- (low basal OCR, high basal\nECAR, and low spare respiratory capacity) and M2- (high OCR, low basal\nECAR, and high spare respiratory capacity) macrophages, the infection-driven\nCD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells demonstrate a dynamic metabolic signature in the transition\nbetween M1- and M2-like macrophages in line with the proteomic signature\nelucidated through QTiPs. This analysis further confirms the highly\nplastic nature of the myeloid cell\u2013macrophage transition and,\nin line with the recent evidence67,68 specifically\nusing lipopolysaccharide/TLR4 stimulation versus IL-4-stimulated BM-derived\nmacrophages, further supports the hypothesis that in vitro-generated\nmacrophages do not completely recapitulate all metabolic and functional\ncharacteristics of in vivo-isolated or human cells.\n\nIn conclusion,\nQTiPs analysis comprehensively captures the temporospatial\ntransition of inflammatory CD11b+, Ly6G\u2013, Ly6Chigh-low cells following reovirus infection. These\ndata contain a plethora of information on native, as well as infection-driven,\nmyeloid cells that reside in the BM or at the SOI and are a resource\nfor future hypothesis testing with regard to myeloid-specific differentiation,\nantiviral response, and metabolic alteration. The data also have implications\nfor the therapeutic management of myeloid cells in the context of\nantiviral immune responses, vaccine development, cancer immunotherapies,\nand especially oncolytic virus therapies, which are known to drive\nmyeloid cell recruitment to the tumor microenvironment following administration.26 Our data also demonstrate that the QTiPs approach\ncan be applied further to precisely capture the complex, dynamic,\nand temporal nature of other types of immune cells collected from\ntheir in situ microenvironment."}
