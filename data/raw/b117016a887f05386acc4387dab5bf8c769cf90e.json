This SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was declared as a public health 53 emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on Jan 30 [5] .\n\nMuch research progress has been made in dissecting the evolution and origin of SARS-CoV-2 [6-56 8], as well as characterizing its clinical features [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] and epidemics [16] [17] [18] [19] in the past one and 57 half months . These efforts would significantly guide us to contain the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. 58 While the outbreak is on-going, people raise grave concerns about the future trajectory of the 59 outbreak, especially given that the working and schooling time has been already dramatically 60 postponed after the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday was over (scheduled on Jan 31). It is highly 61 demanding to estimate the potential total number of confirmed cases, both nationally and locally.\n\nHere we present Boltzmann function-based regression analyses on the data of confirmed cases of 80 Data were organized in Microsoft Excel and then incorporated into Microcal Origin software 81 (note: 2021 Jan 21 was set as day 1 and so on). The Boltzmann function was applied to data 82 simulation for each set of data regarding different geographic regions (e.g.., China, Hubei 83 Province and so on) and parameters of each function were obtained, with the potential total 84 number of confirmed cases being directly given by parameter A2. Estimation of critical dates was 85 performed by predicting the cumulative number of confirmed cases in the coming days post Feb 86 14, 2020, and the key dates were provisionally set when the number of daily new confirmed cases 87 is lower than 0.1% of the potential total number. The Boltzmann function for simulation is 88 expressed as follows:\n\nwhere C(x) is the cumulative number of confirmed cases at day x; A1, A2, x0, and dx are constants.\n\nIn particular, A2 represents the estimated potential total number of confirmed cases of SARS-92 CoV-2. Details of derivation of the Boltzmann function for epidemic analysis are described in the 93 supporting information file. 95 A Monte Carlo technique is applied to assess the uncertainty in the estimated total number of 96 confirmed cases due to the uncertainty in the reported number cases. 1000 non-linear regressions 97 were performed with the same time series data but each data point in the time series was perturbed 98 by multiplying with a random scaling factor that represents the relative uncertainty. We assumed 99 that the relative uncertainty follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and a 100 standard deviation of 10%. This implies that all reported cases are positive but there is a tendency 101 to miss-reporting some positive cases so that the reported numbers represent a lower limit. The 102 resulting mean and 95% confidence interval (CI) were presented.\n\nIn light of daily reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 since Jan 21, 2020, we decided to collect data for 107 analysis on the cumulative number of confirmed cases (initially from Jan 21 to Feb 10, 2020) in from Jan 21 to Feb 14 for Hubei Province by a fixed factor (refer to Table S1), assuming that 121 these newly added cases were linearly accumulative in those days. It is the same forth with the 122 data for Wuhan City.\n\n.

Parameter A2 in the Boltzmann 127 function directly represents the potential total number of confirmed cases (refer to equation 1). 128 As summarized in Table 1 , the potential total number of confirmed cases for mainland China, 129 Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other provinces were estimated as 72800\u00b1600, 59300\u00b1600, 130 42100\u00b1700 and 12800\u00b1100; respectively (also refer to Fig. 1) ; those for the six mostly influenced 131 provinces (Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan, Hunan, Anhui and Jiangxi) were 1300\u00b110, 1170\u00b110, 132 1260\u00b110, 1050\u00b110, 1020\u00b110 and 940\u00b110, respectively (also refer to Fig. 2) ; those for the top-4 133 major cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen) were 394\u00b14, 328\u00b13, 337\u00b13 and 397\u00b14, 134 respectively (also refer to Fig. S1 ).\n\nIn addition, we estimated the key date, on which the number of daily new confirmed cases is 137 lower than 0.1% of the potential total number of confirmed cases as defined by us subjectively.\n\nAs summarized in Table 1 , the key dates for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City and 139 other provinces are Feb28 or Feb 27. It appears that it will take approximately two weeks for 140 mainland China to reach this state such that the number of daily new confirmed cases of SARS-\n\nCoV-2 post the critical date is below 70.\n\nThe above analyses were performed assuming that the released data on the confirmed cases are 144 precise. However, there is a tendency to miss-report some positive cases such that the reported 145 numbers represent a lower limit. One typical example indicating this uncertainty is the sudden 146 increase of more than 13 000 new confirmed cases in Hubei province on Feb 12 after clinical 147 features were officially accepted as a standard for infection confirmation. Another uncertainty 148 might result from insufficient kits for viral nucleic acid detection at the early stage of the outbreak. 149 We thus examined the effects of the uncertainty of the released data on the estimation of the 150 potential total number of confirmed cases using a Monte Carlo method (for detail, refer to the 151 Methods section). For simplicity, we assumed that the relative uncertainty of the reported data 152 follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and a standard deviation of 10%.\n\nUnder the above conditions, the potential total numbers of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 for 155 different regions were estimated (Figs. 3, S2 and S3) and summarized in Table 1 \n\nSuch uncertainty analysis also allowed us to estimate the key dates at 95% CI. As summarized in 165 Table 1 , the key dates for mainland China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, and other provinces 166 would fall in (2/28, 3/10), (2/27, 3/10), (2/28, 3/10) and (2/27, 3/13), respectively (also refer to \n\n.

More importantly, the data of 2003 SARS-CoV in China 203 and worldwide were also well fitted to the function (Fig. 4) . These results, in conjunction with 204 that Boltzmann function can be inferred from a few assumptions (for detail, refer to the Methods 205 section of the support information file), suggest that Boltzmann function is suitable for analyzing 206 the epidemics of coronaviruses like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. One advantage of this model 207 is that parameter A2 directly gives an estimate of the potential total numbers of confirmed cases.\n\nIn addition, unlike traditional epidemiological models that require much more detailed data for indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China might not be as bad as thought. Notably, our 220 results also suggest that the number of daily new confirmed cases will become minimal between 221 Feb 28 and Mar 10 in mainland China (including Hubei Province) at 95% CI (Fig. 3A) . This trend, 222 if occur as predicted, may help citizens in China to release stress and anxiety, as there have been 223 .

In further support of these 225 estimates by the Boltzmann function, the newly released cumulative number of confirmed cases 226 in all the above geographic regions on Feb 15 and Feb 16 are very close to the predicted ones 227 (refer to Table S2 ). Consistently, parameters of the established Boltzmann functions by 228 regression analyses of the data from Jan 21 to Feb 16, 2020 (as presented in Fig. S4 ) are highly 229 similar to those made by the data from Feb 21 to Feb 14, 2020.\n\nNevertheless, our estimates based on the established Boltzmann functions are not absolutely 232 guaranteed, mainly because of the uncertainty of the reported data (Figs. 3, S2 and S3) . We 233 estimated the potential total numbers (refer to Table 1) under the assumption that the relative 234 uncertainty of the reported data follows a single-sided normal distribution with a mean of 1.0 and 235 a standard deviation of 10%, and this deviation may be underestimated. If the real uncertainty of 236 released data by health commissions is larger than 10%, the potential total numbers of confirmed 237 cases would accordingly increase, and the key dates will be postponed. Another limitation is that 238 this estimate is based on the assumption that the overall conditions are not changing. This might 239 not be true, given that in many regions the workers have started to return for work half a month \n\nEthical approval or individual consent was not applicable. 256\n\nAll data and materials used in this work were publicly available, and also available based on request. 258\n\nThe funding agencies had no role in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, 260 and interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; or decision to submit the 261 manuscript for publication. 262\n\nThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest. .
