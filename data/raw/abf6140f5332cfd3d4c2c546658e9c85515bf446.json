{"title": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme polymorphism affects outcome of local Chinese with acute lung injury", "body": "Acute lung injury (ALI) with high mortality remains a common disease in intensive care unit (ICU). Generally speaking, infection is the primary cause, which induces excessive cytokines from inflammatory cells and enhances inflammatory response. Factors predicting the onset, severity or outcome of this disease are not well known. Experimental evidence suggests that activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), especial angiotensin (AT) may influence the pathogenesis of ALI via affecting inflammation including producing inflammatory factors and apoptosis. 1 Angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) is a key enzyme that converts AT-I to AT-II. The human ACE gene is located on chromosome 17q23, while its polymorphism is consists of the presence (insertion, I) and absence (deletion, D) of a 287-bp Alu repeat sequence in intron 16. 2 ACE I/D polymorphism has been shown to influence the prognosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome, 2 and is different with various races and districts. 3 There was no report of ACE genotypes in the Han Chinese with ALI in the district.\n\nWe therefore focused on the relationship between ACE I/D polymorphism and the onset and prognosis of ALI. And we also investigated the effects of ACE I/D genotypes on ACE level from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).\n\nThe present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongda Hospital, the Affiliated Hospital of Southeast University (Nanjing, China). Over a period of one year, patients over 18-year-old, which divided into two groups, ALI and non-ALI patients, admitted to a specialized ICU of Zhongda Hospital, were considered eligible for the study. Healthy blood donors were healthy subjects' donors during the same period. All subjects were ethnical Chinese and were not genetically related.\n\nALI patients fulfilled the joint American/European Consensus Committee criteria for ALI: a) acute onset, b) bilateral pulmonary infiltrations, c) impaired oxygenation (PaO 2 /FiO 2 of <300 mmHg), and d) pulmonary artery occlusion pressure of <18mmHg, or no evidence of left heart failure. Patients in the non-ALI group were all admitted to the hospital over the same period due to other diseases. Healthy controls were healthy blood donors. They were all local Chinese with no gender differences. Exclusion criteria were: a) history of ALI, b) received ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor antagonist within one month before the development of ALI, c) having liver or renal failure in terminal stage, d) pregnancy or lactation, e) malignant tumor or immunological disease, f) history of bone marrow transplant or lung transplant, g) received immunosuppressive drug, h) Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 7.\n\nThe following data were collected from the ALI group: sex, age, reason for admission, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) sores, Lung Injury Scores (LIS), PaO2/FiO2, duration of mechanical ventilation and vasoactive agents, number of organ failure, duration of ICU stay and 28-day mortality.\n\nDNA was extracted from whole blood samples by modified phenol-chloroform extraction. ACE genotype was determined by three-primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification as described previously. 4 This method yielded amplification products of 83 bp for D allele and 65 bp for I allele. Standard polymerase chain primer was performed with three primers (5 0 -CATCCTTTCTCCCATTTCTC-3 0 , 5 0 -ATT TCAGAGCTGGAATAAAATT-3 0 and 5 0 -TGGGATTACAGGCGTGA TACAG-3 0 ). The DNA was amplified for 35-cycled with denaturation at 94 C for 1 min, annealling at 53 C for 1 min, and extension at 72 C for 1 min, followed by final extension at 72 C for 10 min. The PCR products were identified on polyacrylamide gels. The genotypic distributions and allelic frequencies of ACE I/D polymorphism among the three groups were calculated.\n\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated from whole blood of healthy blood donors by density gradient centrifugation (LTS 1077, Hao Yang Biological Manufacture Co. Ltd, Tianjin, China). The buffy coat layer containing PBMC at the interface was carefully removed, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min. The cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies), and incubated in the presence of 5% CO 2 in air at 37 C in 24-well plates. After 6 h or 24 h incubation period with or without LPS incubation (final concentration of LPS 0.1 mg/ml), cells or supernatant were collected.\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from cultured PBMC cells using TRNZOL (DP405-01, Tiangen Biological Manufacture Co. Ltd, Beijing, China) according to the instruction from the manufacture. After RNA was transcribed with TaKaRa PrimeScript\u00e4 RT-PCR Kit (DRR014A, TAKARA Biotechnology Co. Ltd, Dalian, China), PCR amplification of cDNA was done. Primer pairs of ACE were 5 0 -CAGGAGTGGA-GACCGAGA-3 0 (sense) and 5 0 -CCAGACAAGCCCAACCTC -3 0 (an ti-sense) with a predicted size 394 bp. The cycle profile included denaturation for 30 s at 94 C, annealing for 60 s at 59 C and extension for 40 s at 72 C. Human b-actin, regarded as internal control for stable expression, was amplified with primers of 5 0 -CTGGAAGGTGGACAGCGAGG-3 0 (sense) and 5 0 -TGACGTGGACATCCGCAAAG-3 0 (anti-sense) with a predicted size 207 bp. The cycle profile included denaturation for 30 s at 94 C, annealing for 60 s at 53 C and extention for 40 s at 72 C. The resulting densities of the ACE bands were expressed relative to the corresponding density of the actin band from the same RNA sample.\n\nThe ACE activity of cultural cells supernatant was measured by hydrolysis of hippuril-glycyl-glycine. Briefly, hippuroyl glycyl-glycine was hydrolysis into hippuric acid and glycylglycine by ACE. And hippuric acid was extracted by ethyl acetate and distilled, then soluted in sodium chloride. The mixture was monitored ultraviolet spectrophotometrically at 228 nm.\n\nThe SPSS statistical package (version 13.0) was used for the statistical analysis. Continuous data were expressed as mean AE SD. Comparisons of the continuous data were performed by homogeneity test for variance firstly. Then the data were analyzed by ANOVA or KruskaleWallis, Man-neWhitney test. The chi-square tables were used to compare the distribution of genotypes and alleles frequencies. The 28-day survival rate among the genotype groups was estimated by the KaplaneMeier method. Multivariate logistic-regression analysis was used to assess prognostic factors. For all test, a p value of \uff1c 0.05 was considered significant.\n\nClinical data of ALI and non-ALI patients, and control subjects 101 ALI patients (age, 65.1 AE 16.5 yrs; 68 men and 33 women), 408 non-ALI patients and 236 healthy subjects were enrolled. Clinical characteristics of ALI patients were summarized in Table 1 . The common causes of ALI patients in this study were pneumonia (61.4%), sepsis (18.8%) and trauma (12.9%).\n\nGenotypes and allele frequencies of ACE polymorphism data Table 2 summarized the ACE genotype (II, ID, and DD) and allele (I and D) frequencies of the three groups. DD genotype accounted for a similar percentage (13.8%, 10.1% and 9.8%, respectively; p \uff1e 0.05). The frequencies of D allele in three groups were 34.2%, 35.7% and 32%, respectively. Comparisons showed that there was no significant difference in the genotype and allele frequencies among these groups. \n\nThe 28-day mortality of the ALI patients was 27.7%. The 28day mortality was significantly different among the three ACE genotypes (17.4%, 26.8%, and 64.3% for II, ID, and DD, respectively; p Z 0.013). Patients with the DD genotype had a lower possibility of survival for 28 days as compared with other groups (Fig. 1) . for DD genotype, II genotype and ID genotype group, respectively, P Z 0.038) ( Fig. 2A) .\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2B , after incubation of LPS for 24 h, ACE activity in cell cultured supernatant was higher than that in control group (P < 0.05). The ACE activity of the PBMC with DD genotype was significantly higher compared with that with II genotype group, (60.76 AE 24.55 U and 33.33 AE 13.32 U, respectively, P Z 0.01). And The ACE \n\nIt has been shown that there are marked ethnic differences in the polymorphisms of the ACE gene. 3 Reports from the western countries indicated that the D allele frequency was usually higher than that of I allele, accounting for 51%e56% in the general population, 5 whereas in the Asian countries, the frequency of the D allele was lower. 3 In our study, the D allele frequency of local Chinese was 32%e35.7%. As shown in the reports from Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, the D allele frequency among ethnic Chinese people was 30%e 45%. This may result in a smaller proportion of people carrying the DD genotype, ranging from 9.8% to 13.8% in our study, and it was similar to those previously reported in Chinese ethnic populations, ranging from 9% to 16%. Our study showed that the ALI patients with the DD genotype of the ACE gene had higher 28-day mortality. Meanwhile, there was a similar distribution of genotypes and allele frequencies of the ACE I/D gene in patients with ALI, non-ALI and healthy control subjects. This study therefore suggested that the polymorphism was associated with the outcome rather than risk for ALI in the local Chinese population.\n\nACE I/D polymorphism was not associated with the susceptibility of ALI in our finding. Just like many similar studies suggested that the genotype was not an independent risk factor. 6, 7 However, compared with both the CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting) and ICU comparison groups and the healthy population sample, the frequency of the DD genotype and the D allele was markedly increased in patients with ARDS, which may show this relationship in ARDS. 8 The differences may result from study object, pathogeny and the degree of disease. 9e11 As shown in many reports, there were associations between ACE I/D polymorphism and prognosis of many diseases. 2,3,12e14 Our finding also indicated the patients with the DD genotype were more emergent and had higher mortality. DD genotype was the significant independent prognostic factors for the 28-day outcome. Though cases in the study were not sufficient, the proportions of the ACE genotypes were similar to those previously reported in Chinese ethnic groups. However, due to a relatively small proportion of people carrying the DD genotype in the general population among Asian people, more cases may be required.\n\nTo investigate the underlying mechanism for improved outcome, we focus on the diverse effect of gene expression and enzyme activity in LPS-induced PBMC in-vitro. LPS is an effective activator which may increase ACE mRNA expression and ACE activity in all genotypes. Among the three genotypes, PBMC of DD genotype has the highest level after exposure to LPS. It may be the pathway triggered due to ACE polymorphism. It is well known that the renin-angiotensin system play an important role in inflammation. AT has a proinflammatory effect for the development or aggravation of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. ACE I/D polymorphism had been shown to be associated with injury to lung tissue in severe acute respiratory syndrome. 15 Moreover, ACE plays a major role in the host defense against invading pathogens. 16 It is therefore that polymorphisms in the ACE gene may have an important effect on determining the development and the outcome of ALI.\n\nACE I/D polymorphism is a significant prognostic factor for the outcome of ALI. Patients with the DD genotype have Figure 2 Effect of ACE I/D genotype polymorphism on ACE mRNA expression (A) and ACE activity (B) of LPS-induced PBMC. PBMC was exposed to LPS (0.1 mg/ml) for 6 h, and then total RNA was isolated and RT-PCR was performed. Also, the cellular supernatant was collected for the following ACE activity determination. Data are the mean AE s.d. of three experiments. a P<0.05 vs vehicle control, b P<0.05 vs II group. a higher mortality rate of ALI. I/D polymorphism influences the expression of ACE gene in LPS-stimulated PBMC, and DD genotype leads to higher level of ACE mRNA and ACE activity."}
