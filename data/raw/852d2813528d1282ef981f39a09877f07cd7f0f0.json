{"title": "", "body": "To the Editor:\n\nThe majority of viral infections of the airways are associated with asthma exacerbations in children. Two thirds of these viral infections are caused by rhinovirus, and hospital admissions for asthma correlate with the seasonal peak of rhinovirus infections. 1 TGF-b is a cytokine known to induce forkhead box P3 1 (FoxP3) regulatory T (Treg) cells and retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR) gt 1 T H 17 cells in combination with IL-2 or IL-6, respectively, but also to inhibit the differentiation of T H 1 and T H 2 cells. 2 Because TGF-b and rhinovirus infection both influence asthma exacerbation and TGF-b also induces rhinovirus replication, 3 in this study we analyzed the effect of rhinovirus infection on TGF-b and the role of TGF-b on rhinovirus infection by analyzing asthmatic and nonasthmatic preschool children recruited in the European study Post-infectious Immune Reprogramming and Its Association with Persistence and Chronicity of Respiratory Allergic Diseases (PreDicta) and a murine model of asthma. The clinical data of the analyzed cohorts of children are reported in Table E1 and in the Methods section in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org. In asthmatic children, in 66.6% of the cases, a viral infection was a triggering factor for development of the disease. Rhinovirus was the most common respiratory virus detected in the airways of these children (see Table  E2 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).\n\nTo investigate the role of TGF-b in rhinovirus-induced asthma in children, we analyzed PBMCs from preschool children with and without asthma, which were cultured for 48 hours after 1 hour of in vitro exposure to rhinovirus 1B (RV1B) and subjected them to gene array (Fig 1, A , and see Tables E3-E5 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Because TGF-b induces Treg cells, 2 we first investigated which genes related to tolerance were significantly regulated by rhinovirus in PBMCs from these children. Here we found that in asthmatic children rhinovirus upregulated immunosuppressive genes, such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1; CD274), and interferon-induced transmembrane protein 2 (IFITM2; Fig 1, B and C). Consistent with the array data, we found that IDO1 was upregulated in PBMCs of asthmatic children cultured with rhinovirus compared with those of control children (see Fig E1, A, in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). This regulation was found to be independent from steroids because dexamethasone significantly downregulated IDO in PBMCs (see Fig E1, B) .\n\nBecause TGF-b is secreted in a latent complex consisting of 3 proteins (TGF-b, the inhibitor latency-associated protein [LAP] , and the ECM-binding protein LTBP), we also analyzed these and other TGF-b-inhibitory proteins. We noticed that TGF-binhibitory genes, such as TGIF2 and LAP3, were upregulated in rhinovirus-treated PBMCs from asthmatic children. Moreover, rhinovirus inhibited genes that cleave viruses, such as RNASE1, in PBMCs from children with asthma (Fig 1, B and C). By contrast, in control children rhinovirus did not significantly regulate these genes. In these children other factors were found to be significantly regulated by rhinovirus, such as lymphocyte antigen 6E (Fig 1, D and E) , a protein involved in the TGF-b pathway. Moreover, we found that in PBMCs from control children, rhinovirus induced IL-32 (Fig 1, C and D) . Expression of this protein is known to induce the production of IL-6 and TNF-a and might thereby modulate immune responses. 4 In subsequent experiments we analyzed in more detail the regulation of TGF-b in a larger group of children in the same cohort. Among PBMC supernatants, TGF-b protein was detected in high amounts in untreated cell-culture supernatants in both asthmatic and control children. However, after ex vivo challenge with rhinovirus, TGF-b protein expression was found to be significantly decreased (Fig 2, A) , although TGFB mRNA expression remained constant (Fig 2, B) . Because rhinovirus infection suppressed TGF-b release, we assumed that rhinovirus facilitates TGF-b binding to the cell membrane, and for this reason, we could not detect it in the supernatants of rhinovirus-infected PBMCs.\n\nTo prove this concept of a viral immune escape mechanism, we analyzed the expression of TGFBRII in PBMCs in the presence or absence of in vitro rhinovirus infection. We found that PBMCs isolated from control and asthmatic children and infected with rhinovirus expressed increased levels of TGFBRII compared with the respective controls (Fig 2, C) . This finding suggests that rhinovirus induced TGF-b receptor II expression, thus increasing TGFb binding to the cell membrane and in this way explaining why we could not detect it in the cell supernatants.\n\nTo further analyze the influence of TGF-b signaling in molecules downstream of TGF-b, we then analyzed FOXP3 and RORC levels and found that PBMCs infected in vitro with rhinovirus express significantly more FOXP3 and RORC mRNA (Fig 2, D and E) in both control and asthmatic children.\n\nWhen we analyzed the correlation of FOXP3 and RORC mRNA expression, we found a positive correlation of these 2 transcription factors in rhinovirus-challenged PBMCs in both groups of children (Fig 2, F-I) . Taken together, rhinovirus infection induced FOXP3 and RORC.\n\nWe then asked whether T-box transcription factor (T-bet), a transcription factor known to regulate T H 1/2, Treg, and T H 17 cell development or activation, 5 could be regulated by rhinovirus in PBMCs of children with asthma. Although we previously detected decreased TBX21 mRNA expression in asthmatic patients, 6 here we found increased TBX21 mRNA levels in PBMCs isolated from asthmatic children after infection with rhinovirus compared with rhinovirus-infected PBMCs from control children (Fig 2, J) . Thus TBX21 can be upregulated in asthmatic patients during active rhinovirus infection. IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine that, together with TGF-b, can induce the differentiation of T H 17 cells. 2 We found an upregulation of IL6 mRNA in control children after in vitro culture with rhinovirus. In contrast, asthmatic children showed a failure of such IL6 induction (Fig 2, K) .\n\nBy analyzing naive and asthmatic mice, we found that in vitro treatment of lung cells with rhinovirus increased the proportions of T C 1 cells, whereas adding TGF-b to the culture inhibited T-bet expression in CD4 1 T cells, as well as IDO expression in total lung cells. The experimental set up, as well as the results, are described in detail in Figs E2 and E3 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org.\n\nIn summary, these data suggest that in patients with acute rhinovirus infections, endogenous TGF-b is retained intracellularly in rhinovirus-infected cells, resulting in a T-bet-mediated immune response. At the moment, we do not know which cells are infected by rhinovirus in the PBMC population we examined; however, we assume that plasmacytoid dendritic cells are infected because of the induction of IDO after rhinovirus challenge ex vivo. 6 However, rhinovirus infection also activates TGF-b present in the environment, as in patients with chronic asthma, to replicate and inhibit effective antiviral immune responses. Thus it is possible that children with acute asthma are able to induce an effective anti-rhinovirus immune response during acute exacerbation. By contrast, in patients with chronic asthma, TGF-b is increased in its active form and is released by structural cells. In this latter situation, when the rhinovirus infects plasmacytoid dendritic cells, this exogenous TGF-b inhibits T H 1 and T C 1 cells that carry the TGF-b receptor, resulting in T H 1 cell depletion, and thus rhinovirus infection cannot be cleared. Although these data need further investigation, they open new avenues for our understanding of the role of rhinovirus-mediated asthma exacerbations in children. \n\nTo the Editor: Allergen-specific IgE can be detected in cord blood (CB), but the origin and relevance of this finding is controversial. We previously reported that specific IgE in CB against inhalant allergens mainly seemed to be the result of transfer of maternal IgE to the fetus, 1 whereas others suggested that such IgE is of fetal origin, 2-6 thus representing intrauterine sensitization. This distinction is important: intrauterine sensitization could be targeted by prenatal intervention and would suggest CB specific IgE as a relevant disease marker in the newborn, whereas maternally transferred IgE, either as a sampling artifact or due to transplacental transfer, would have no independent value as a disease marker and no long-term consequences for allergy in the offspring.\n\nHere, we aimed to test the hypothesis that specific IgE against inhalant allergens in CB is of maternal origin. We hypothesized that applying strict sampling procedures and including unselected women with low levels of IgE would result in limited, if any, specific IgE in CB.\n\nWomen with singleton pregnancies were invited to participate in the study, as previously described. 7 The investigation conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Scientific Ethics Committee and the Danish Data Surveillance Authority.\n\nBlood was taken from the umbilical vein by needle puncture performed by a single investigator. Samples were available for 260 maternal blood (MB)-CB pairs. IgE antibody levels were determined using the ImmunoCAP assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden). MB and CB were analyzed for levels of specific IgE against common inhalant and food allergens (lower detection limit, 0.1 kUa/L) and for total IgE (lower detection limit, 0.1 kU/L using a combination of the standard and low-level total IgE assays). IgA levels in CB samples were analyzed by ELISA (detection limit, 0.1 mg/L). Further information on methodology can be found in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org.\n\nAn elevated IgA level in CB (>50 mg/L) was considered indicative of contamination with MB. 1, 8 This was found in only 3 (1%) of the CB samples compared with 21 samples (9%) in our previous study. 8 High levels of specific IgE in MB (sum of specific IgE >100 kUa/L) were found in 4 samples (2%) compared with 12 samples (5%) in our previous study 1 (Table I) . Correspondingly, specific IgE against inhalant allergens (> _0.1 kUa/L) was found in only 2 CB samples (<1%) compared with 22 (9%) in our previous study 1 (Table I and Fig 1) .\n\nIn Fig 1, the relationship between specific IgE against inhalant allergens in CB and MB is depicted. We have included prediction lines for the level of specific IgE in CB in relation to the level in MB, stratified by level of CB IgA, based on results from our previous study. 1 As predicted, specific IgE against inhalant allergens in CB was present only when either the level of CB IgA was very high or the corresponding maternal sample had highly elevated levels of specific IgE. For the 2 CB samples with specific IgE against inhalant allergens, corresponding IgE against the same allergen was found in the maternal sample for 2 out of 3 allergens (see Fig E1 in \n\nOur investigations are part of the Europe-wide study PreDicta. The study was approved by the local ethics committee of the Universit\u20ac atsklinikum Friedrich-Alexander Universit\u20ac at Erlangen-N\u20ac urnberg, Germany (Re-No. 4435). Informed consent was obtained from the parents of all participants. The study is registered in the German Clinical Trial Register (Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien: registration no. DRKS00004914). Subject recruitment and some clinical aspects of the children were recently published and described also elsewhere. E1,E2 This is a longitudinal prospective evaluation over a 2-year period, beginning at the age of 4 to 6 years. In accordance with the PreDicta guidelines, children who met the inclusion criteria in the absence of exclusion criteria were recruited into the study.\n\nChildhood asthma was defined as repeated attacks of airway obstruction and intermittent symptoms of increased airway responsiveness to triggering factors, such as exercise, allergen exposure, and viral infection. The children were asked about shortness of breath (day or night), fatigue, not feeling well, and specific triggers. E3 Moreover, parents and children were asked to fill diary cards at home 3 times a week on a predetermined time frame. The child's symptom score for the last 24 hours was defined as follows: 0, none; 1, mild, 2, moderate; and 3, severe. When the symptoms were level 4 and higher and there was a decrease in FEV 1 of greater than 15% or peak expiratory flow (PEF) of greater than 30%, the parents were asked to contact the doctor.\n\nInclusion criteria for the cases were as follows: written informed consent from the child's parent/guardian; age 4 to 6 years; gestational age of 36 weeks or greater; a diagnosis of asthma within the last 2 years confirmed by a doctor of the participating study center; mild-to-moderate persistent severity according to Global Initiative for Asthma 2005 guidelines; 3 episodes in the preceding 12 months; and capacity of the child to perform a PEF maneuver. For examination, the doctor performed lung function measurements, made a clinical investigation (auscultation), and asked the parent/guardian to fill out a questionnaire. Healthy children of the same age with no reported history of asthma/wheeze, atopic illness, or both were recruited at baseline and at the end of the observation period.\n\nExclusion criteria were severe/brittle asthma; children receiving immunotherapy; more than 6 courses of oral steroids during the preceding 12 months; other chronic respiratory diseases (cystic fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and immunodeficiencies), except allergic rhinitis; and other chronic diseases with continuous medication use, except atopic eczema. Differentiation of asthma bronchiale from bronchiolitis was done mainly based on the clinical diagnosis and additionally mostly based on the presence of rhinovirus in the PCR samples of the nasal swabs. Bronchiolitis in Europe is an inflammatory disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus/rhinovirus infection with tachypnea and diffuse fine crackles, and oxygen is needed in some of these children.\n\nOther wheezing disorders could be anatomically defined, such as stenosis in the airways, hemangioma in the larynx, double aortic arch, and vascular ring/sling. The character of these disorders is continuous and less repetitive, and there are no or few effects of bronchial dilatators.\n\nAt the baseline visit (B0) and after 24 months (F4), whole blood was drawn from the children and collected in heparin tubes for PBMC isolation.\n\nIf, during the 24-month follow-up period, an asthmatic child experienced an exacerbation, the parents were instructed to call the study center and arrange a visit to the clinic within the next 2 days (symptomatic visit). An exacerbation was defined as follows: a respiratory tract infection/cold; an exacerbation of asthma; a symptom score according to the diary cards of 4 or greater; and a decrease in FEV 1 of greater than 15% or PEF of greater than 30%. At this symptomatic visit, a trained doctor examined and evaluated the child, obtained a nasopharyngeal swab for virus analysis (at the University of Turku), and collected peripheral blood for serum analysis. All exacerbations were analyzed. However, during the entire observation period, only 1 cold per child was analyzed. Cold was defined as symptoms of the upper respiratory tract and general symptoms.\n\nAt the time of recruitment (B0), PBMCs were isolated from heparinized blood with Ficoll. After isolation, PBMCs were adjusted to a concentration of 1 3 10 6 viable cells/mL in complete culture medium. For cell culture, RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mmol/L HEPES (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) was used. Furthermore, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, 50 mmol/L b-mercaptoethanol, 1% L-glutamine (200 mmol/L), 1% MEM Vitamin, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 10% HI-FBS were added (complete culture medium); these reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). After PBMC isolation and before cell culture, some PBMCs were infected with RV1B, which was grown, as previously described. E1\n\nFor rhinovirus infection, rhinovirus strain RV1B was used. RV1B is currently classified as RV-A species among other 79 rhinovirus serotypes that use intercellular adhesion molecule 1 as their cellular receptor. It is the prototype virus strain and is therefore commonly used in experimental rhinovirus studies. E4 RV1b was grown, as previously described. E1 After PBMC isolation and before cell culture, some of the PBMCs were infected with rhinovirus (500 mL/10 6 cells) by shaking for 1 hour at room temperature. After rhinovirus challenge, the cells were washed with medium and cultured in complete culture medium, as were the uninfected cells. Cell culture was performed for 48 hours at 378C and 5% CO 2 . As a control, cells were cultured with cell-culture medium alone. Supernatants were collected for ELISA, and RNAwas extracted from the cells for RNA gene arrays and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The HRVA1B titer was tissue culture infectious dose of 50% (TCID50): 10 7 . \n\nFor RNA gene arrays, only RNA that passed high-stringency quality controls was reverse transcribed. Biotinylated cDNA was prepared according to the standard Illumina protocol (Illumina, San Diego, Calif) from 13.9 ng of total RNA by using the amplification kit Pico WTA (lot no. 1404311-A/C), followed by labeling 3 mg of cDNA with the kit Encore BiotinIL module (lot no. 1212262-D). BeadChips were scanned by using the Illumina iScan Scanner running Illumina iSCAN control software, version 3.3.28. Data were analyzed with Illumina GenomeStudio, version 2011. Heat maps were generated by performing supervised clustering on normalized expression data with R software, version 3.1, and library gplots. Genes selected for analysis showed statistically significant regulation by rhinovirus. E5 ELISA Human TGF-b1 was detected in cell-culture supernatants by using OptEIA sandwich ELISA kits from BD Biosciences (Heidelberg, Germany), according to the manufacturer's protocol.\n\nWild-type mice were on a BALB/c genetic background. The experiments were performed with age-and sex-matched mice at the age of 6 to 8 weeks. The animals were bred in the animal facility adjacent to our institute with temperature control and had free access to food and water. All experiments were performed with approved licenses (23-177-07/G09-1-008 from the ethical review board Rheinland-Pfalz and 54-2532.1-55/12 from the government of Lower Franconia, Germany).\n\nWild-type BALB/c mice were treated at day 0 of the ovalbumin (OVA) protocol with a 200-mL injection of OVA complexed with alum (100 mg) intraperitoneally (500 mg/mL). At days 7, 8, and 9, 25 mL of OVA dissolved in PBS was administered (2 mg/mL). At day 10, mice were killed, and lung cells were isolated, as previously described. E6 Isolated cells were cultured at a density of 1 million cells per milliliter in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin, respectively. Cells were either left untreated or incubated with rhinovirus (see below). Cell culture was performed in the presence of absence of 10 ng/mL TGF-b for 48 hours at 378C and 5% CO 2 . After culturing, supernatants were collected and cells were used for flow cytometry or RNA isolation. Experimental setups are depicted in Figs E2 , A, and E3, A.\n\nFor rhinovirus infection, total lung cells were incubated with rhinovirus (500 mL of rhinovirus/10 6 cells) on a horizontal shaker for 1 hour at room temperature, as described for PBMC cultures above.\n\nRNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR in murine total lung cells RNA was extracted from murine total lung cells by using PeqGold RNA Pure, according to the manufacturer's protocol (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany). Cells were directly resuspended in PeqGold RNA Pure for RNA isolation. RNA (1 mg) was then reverse transcribed by using the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit for RT-PCR (MBI Fermentas, St-Leon-Rot, Germany). The resulting template cDNA was amplified by means of qPCR with SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Munich, Germany). qPCR was performed with a cycle of 2 minutes at 988C and 50 cycles of 5 seconds at 958C and 10 seconds at 608C, followed by 5 seconds at 658C and 5 seconds at 958C in a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The primers and sequences used for mice were as follows: mouse Ido \n\nTotal lung cells were cultured as indicated above. After 48 hours, cells were harvested, washed, and stained with anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 antibodies (BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes at 48C, and for intracellular staining, the cells were washed and permeabilized with Permwash and Permfix (BD Biosciences) for 35 minutes at 48C. After washing, cells were stained in stain buffer (BD Biosciences) with anti-T-bet or anti-IFN-g antibodies (BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes at 48C. Cells were washed and resolved in stain buffer, acquired by using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences), and analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, Ore).\n\nFor intracellular cytokine staining, cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/mL), ionomycin (500 ng/mL), and protein transport inhibitor (GolgiStop, BD Biosciences) for 4 hours in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and as previously described.\n\nPCR was performed to verify that infection with RV1b in PBMCs was successful, as described below. RNAwas isolated with PeqGold RNA pure and reverse transcribed into cDNA. Subsequently, 2 mL of cDNA, 0.5 mL per primer (OL26: 59-GCA CTT CTG TTT CCC C-39; OL27: CGG ACA CCC AAA GTA G), 4.5 mL of diethyl pyrocarbonate H 2 O, and 12.5 mL of KAPA2G Fast Ready Mix were used. The rhinovirus PCR runs were in 32 cycles, starting with denaturation (at 948C for 30 seconds), followed by primer annealing (at 508C for 30 seconds) and elongation (at 728C for 2 minutes), completed by a post-PCR extending step (at 728C for 4 minutes). Therefore an amplicon of 380 bp was generated, which was analyzed and quantified with QIAxcel Advanced Systems (Qiagen).\n\nDifferences were evaluated for significance by using the Student t test. Data are presented as mean values 6 SEMs.\n\nThe average age of control subjects and cases was 4.7 and 4.9 years, respectively. By rating the severity of the disease according to Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines (2005), 60% of the children had intermittent, 25% had mild persistent, and 10% had moderate persistent asthma. Steroid or steroid/ nonsteroid drug combined treatment was used by 79% of children with asthma. Analysis of the lung function of cases and control subjects showed that 72.7% of control subjects and only 45.8% of the children with asthma had an FEV 1 of greater than 100% (see Table E1 ).\n\nWe also investigated which T-cell type is selected after ex vivo infection of lung cells from naive and asthmatic mice with rhinovirus (Fig E2, A) . Consistent with human data, we observed that in naive lung cells rhinovirus induces an effective antiviral immune response by upregulating T C 1 cells (CD8 1 IFN-g 1 ; Fig E2, B) .\n\nIt is known that rhinovirus is able to directly activate T cells. E7 To determine whether exogenous active TGF-b would influence the T-cell immune response to rhinovirus, we exposed lung cells from naive and asthmatic wild-type mice with rhinovirus in vitro and then cultured them with TGF-b (see Fig E3, A) . In naive total lung cells TGF-b inhibited Ido expression in rhinovirus-treated cells (Fig E3, B) . Here we found that, consistent with an immunosuppressive role of TGF-b on T H 1 cells, E8 CD4 1 Tbet 1 cells were inhibited (Fig E3, B) . \n\nExpressed by activated T cells. Other T cells can receive an inhibitory signal from CTLA4 to prevent an overreaction of the immune system.\n\nTryptophan-converting enzyme that promotes T cell-mediated tolerance and antimicrobial effects.

This cytokine is an important mediator of the inflammatory response and is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.\n\nEncodes an interferon-induced antiviral protein that inhibits entry of viruses to the host cell cytoplasm, permitting endocytosis but preventing subsequent viral fusion and release of viral contents into the cytosol.\n\nEncodes a protein called a low-density lipoprotein receptor. This receptor binds to low-density lipoproteins, which are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the blood. Also, some rhinoviruses bind to the LDL receptor.\n\nEncodes a gene that is a member of the Toll-like receptor family. Takes part in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity.
