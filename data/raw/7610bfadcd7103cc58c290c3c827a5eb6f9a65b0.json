{"title": "Potent neutralizing antibodies in the sera of convalescent COVID-19 patients 1 are directed against conserved linear epitopes on the SARS-CoV-2 spike 2 protein 3", "body": "converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with a better affinity than SARS-CoV S 66 glycoprotein for entry [2] . Thus, blocking the binding to ACE2, or blocking host 67 protease cleavage to release the fusion peptide is an efficient strategy to prevent 68 coronavirus entry [3] [4] [5] . To date, one study has assessed the immunogenicity of 69 structural domains of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein [6] . At the time of writing, 70 findings on SARS-CoV-2 linear epitopes remain limited to bioinformatics prediction of 71 human B and T-cell epitopes using SARS-CoV as a model [7] [8] [9] . Five regions on the 72 S glycoprotein of [784] [785] [786] [787] [788] [789] [790] [791] [792] [793] [794] [795] [796] [797] [798] [799] [800] [801] [802] [803] were predicted to be associated with a robust immune response [7] , while 74 other studies reported candidate epitopes [8, 9] that require validation with human 75 patient samples. 76 author/funder.

A total of 25 79 convalescence serum samples collected during the current COVID-19 outbreak in 80\n\nSingapore were screened at 1:1000 dilution for neutralizing antibodies against a 81 pseudotyped lentivirus expressing SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein tagged with a 82 luciferase reporter (Figure 1a) . Of the 25 patients tested, six patients (2, 4, 6, 7, 11, 83 20) with sufficient amount of serum samples that displayed a good neutralizing 84 activity were selected for further functional characterization. Sera from all patients 85 showed similar IC 50 , ranging from a titre of 694 to 836, except patient 20, who 86 showed the strongest neutralizing activity with an IC 50 of 1603 ( Figure 1b) . 87\n\nNext, we assessed the antigenic targets of these sera using a linear B-cell Interestingly, two distinct peptide pools from SARS-CoV-2 S library, pools S14 and 91 S21, were strongly detected by sera from COVID-19 patients, and not by recovered 92 This region encompasses the fusion peptide, which is highly conserved among 98 coronaviruses [10, 11], suggesting a potential pan-coronavirus epitope at this 99 location. Interestingly, targeting this region was also demonstrated to neutralize 100 infection with a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor peptide [12] . Surprisingly, no linear 101 author/funder.

Further 103 assessment of individual peptides within pools S14 and S21 narrowed down the 104 specific region of interest to peptides S14P5 and S21P2, respectively ( Figure 1d ). 105\n\nRecognition of these regions was stronger for the peptides of SARS-CoV-2 than 106 SARS-CoV ( Figure 1e ). Together, these findings suggest that these linear B-cell 107 epitopes are dominant antigenic regions, which corroborated previous bioinformatics 108 predictions [7] . 109\n\nUsing a recently published structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in prefusion 110 conformation [2], peptide S14P5 is localized in proximity to the RBD ( Figure 2a) . As 111 such, it is plausible that antibodies binding to this region may sterically hinder binding 112 to ACE2 receptor, thereby abolishing virus infection [13] . Another possibility could be 113 an allosteric effect on ACE2 binding. Similarly, peptide S21P2 contains a part of the 114 fusion peptide sequence, which may potentially affect virus fusion (Figure 2b ). In 115 order to assess the importance of these regions in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, 116 antibody depletion assays were performed against S14P5 and S21P2 (Figure 2c) . 117\n\nDepletion efficiency and specificity was validated by ELISA, showing that only 118 antibodies against the respective peptides were depleted but not other unrelated 119 antibodies ( Figure 2d ). Interestingly, sera that were depleted for antibodies targeting 120 either peptides S14P5, S21P2, or S14P5+S21P2 led to a significantly reduced ability 121 to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, as compared to the non-depleted 122 sera controls (Figure 2e) . 123\n\nOur results demonstrate that the two B-cell linear epitopes identified in this 124 study are immunodominant. Depletion assays functionally validated that antibodies 125 targeting S14P5 and S21P2 peptides possess significant neutralizing roles against 126 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Importantly, we also assessed the potential 127 presence of mutations in the peptide regions and found a low rate of mutations for 128 S14P5 and S21P2 with low to moderate impact on the viral sequence (2 and 24 129 mutations out of 2596 viral genome sequences respectively, supplementary table 3) 130\n\n[14]. These results are essential to guide the design and evaluation of efficient and 131 specific serological assays, as well as help prioritize vaccine target designs during 132 this unprecedented crisis. 133 author/funder.

(a-b) Localization and sequences of (a) SAR-CoV-2 specific S14P5 and (b) pan-CoV S21P2 epitopes on spike (S) protein (PDB: 6VSB) are shown. Each S monomer is denoted as either pink, blue or orange. (c-e) Pooled sera of COVID-19 patients (n=6) were added to plates coated with the corresponding peptides to deplete specific antibodies. (c) Non-depleted and peptide-specific antibody-depleted sera were then subjected to peptide-based ELISA of the peptide (d) or were crossassayed. Data of depleted sera (white) were normalized to percentages of the non-depleted sera (black). Signal from pooled healthy donor sera were displayed as black dotted lines and data are shown as mean \u00b1 SD. (e) Non-depleted and peptide-specific antibody-depleted pooled sera were then mixed with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus before incubating with CHO-ACE2 cells for 48 h. The percentage of neutralization against pseudovirus infection, relative to the nondepleted sera, are shown. Data are presented as mean \u00b1 SD, and signal from pooled healthy donor sera were displayed as black dotted lines. Statistical analysis was carried out with one-sample t test (*p<0.05, **p<0.01).
