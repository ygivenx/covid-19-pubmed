Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711 Epithelial Injury and Interstitial Fibrosis in the Proximal Al-veolar Regions of Rats Chronically Exposed to a Simulated Pat-tern of Urban Ambient Ozone", "body": "Electron microscopic morphometry was used to study the development of lung injury during and after chronic (78 weeks) exposure to a pattern of ozone (0,) designed to simulate high urban ambient concentrations that occur in some environments. The daily exposure regimen consisted of a 13-hr background of 0.06 ppm, an exposure peak that rose from 0.06 to 0.25 ppm, and returned to the background level over a 9-hr period, and 2hr downtime for maintenance. Rats were exposed for 1, 3, 13, and 78 weeks. Additional groups of rats exposed for 13 or 78 weeks were allowed to recover in filtered clean air for 6 or 17 weeks, respectively. Rats exposed to filtered air for the same lengths of time were used as controls. Samples from proximal alveolar regions and terminal bronchioles were obtained by microdissection. Analysis of the proximal alveolar region revealed a biphasic response. Acute tissue reactions after 1 week of exposure included epithelial inflammation, interstitial edema, interstitial cell hypertrophy, and influx of macrophages. These responses subsided after 3 weeks of exposure. Progressive epithelial and interstitial tissue responses developed with prolonged exposure and included epithelial hyperplasia, fibroblast proliferation, and interstitial matrix accumulation. The epithelial responses involved both type I and type II epithelial cells. Alveolar type I cells increased in number, became thicker, and covered a smaller average surface area. These changes persisted throughout the entire exposure and did not change during the recovery period, indicating the sensitivity of these cells to injury. The main response of type II epithelial cells was cell proliferation. The ' This work was supported in part by EPA cooperative agreement CR8 13 I 13 and a contract from Southern California Edison Co.

Interstitial matrix accumulation underwent partial recovery during follow-up periods in air; however, the thickening of the basement membrane did not resolve. Analysis of terminal bronchioles showed that short-term exposure to OJ caused a loss of ciliated cells and differentiation of preciliated and Clara cells. The bronchiolar cell population stabilized on continued exposure; however, chronic exposure resulted in structural changes, suggesting injury to both ciliated and Clara cells. We conclude that chronic exposure to low levels of 0, causes epithelial inflammation and interstitial fibrosis in the proximal alveolar region and bronchiolar epithelial cell injury. Cc' 1992 Academic Press. Inc. Experimental acute exposures of humans to ambient concentrations of ozone (03) that occur in some urban environments causes decrements in pulmonary function and subjective symptoms of cough, pain on deep inspiration, and shortness of breath. Lung functional changes include increases in airway resistance and respiratory rate and decreases in forced expiratory volume at 1 set (FEVl), forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity, and tidal volume (Bates et al., 1972; Becket et al., 1985 : Folinsbee et al., 1984 McDonnell et al., 1983) . These observations are consistent with animal studies (Raub et al., 1982; Costa et al., 1983) .\n\nWhile the toxicity of high levels of O3 is well established, there are few studies which address whether long-term exposures to the levels of O3 that occur in ambient, urban environments cause lung injury. Recent field studies on the effects of subchronic exposures to ambient O3 on respiratory function in active, normal children have revealed 03-related decreases in FVC and FEVl (Lioy et al., 1985; Spektor et al., 1988) . An important question is what the effects of O3 on the lungs of these children will be after a lifetime of breathing O3 polluted air. Studies with repeated human or animal exposure to O3 (Horvath et al., 198 1; Tepper et al., 1989) as well as the study of children in summer camps, have found that the initial decrement in lung function attenuates with succeeding exposures. However, Tepper et al. (1989) , using rats exposed to 0.5 ppm O3 for 5 days (2.25 hr/day), reported epithelial damage and inflammation in the terminal bronchiolar regions that persisted after the functional alterations diminished. The type of bronchiolar lesion reported by Tepper et al. (1989) is similar to those described by a number of previous studies (Castleman et a/., 1980; Fujinaka et al., 1985; Lum et al., 1978) .\n\nA number of animal studies using subchronic exposure to low levels of 03 have found epithelial thickening and inflammation in the region of the bronchiolar-alveolar duct junction Boorman et al., 1980; Plopper et al., 1978) . reported that rats exposed to 0.12 ppm O3 for 6 weeks ( 12 hr/day) had thickened alveolar epithelium in the proximal alveolar region. It is not certain whether and how these changes progress with chronic exposure and whether chronic exposures to these levels of O3 lead to focal fibrotic or emphysematous lesions.\n\nTo address these questions and to determine whether the patterns of lung injury that occur after chronic low level O3 exposure are reversible, the Inhalation Toxicology Division of the Environmental Protection Agency's Health Effects Research Laboratory conducted an 18-month O3 exposure study and coordinated a series of studies designed to evaluate the progression of health effects associated with chronic lowlevel O3 exposure. We carried out detailed electron microscopic morphometric studies on animals from these exposures to characterize alveolar cell and tissue reactions.\n\nAnimals. Male, 60-day-old F-344 rats (CDF [F-344] Crl BR, VAF + animals, Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Inc., Kingston, NY) were weighed, ear tapged, and randomly assigned to either the air-or O,-exposure groups. They then were transferred to individual wire cages within a barriermaintained exposure facility with food (Purina Rodent Lab Chow, St. Louis, MO) and water available ad libitum for IO days prior to initiation of exposure. Separate groups of rats were purchased for the I-. 3-. 13-, and 78-week studies. Ozone-exposed rats and matched air-exposed controls were studied at six time points after the onset of exposure. These time points were I week, 3 weeks, 13 weeks, 13 weeks plus 6 weeks recovery in clean air (19 weeks). 78 weeks, and 78 weeks plus 17 weeks recovery in clean air (95 weeks). Twelve animals from each exposure group were used. Serum was obtained on arrival from 5% of rats in each shipment and from sentinel rats exposed along with test rats. Sera were tested for and found to be free of antibodies to the following viruses: reovirus Type 3, pneumonia virus of mice, encephalomyelitis, Sendai, mouse adenovirus. sialodacryo adenitis, Toolan H-l, Kilham rat virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis. and rat coronavirus. In addition, lung washes were tested for and found to be free of Mycoplusma pulmonis, and nothing unusual appeared in bacterial cultures from the nasopharynx, trachea, and gut. Rats were also monitored and found to be free of ectoparasites and endoparasites. Air-and O,-exposed animals were handled identically at all times.\n\nExposure regimen and fiility.\n\nThe exposure was carried out in facilities operated by the Inhalation Toxicology Division of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Health Effects Research Laboratory (Research Triangle Park. NC) and by ManTech Environmental Technology, Inc. (RTP. NC).\n\nA complete description of the automated exposure facility has been reported by Davies et al. (1987) . Briefly, animals were exposed in identical walk-in 14.2 m3 environmental rooms. Computer-interfaced mechanical systems monitored and controlled exposure concentration. temperature (74 + 3\"F), humidity (60 f 10%). chamber air flow, and lighting. Ozone was generated by passing cylinder-supplied oxygen (National Specialty Gas Co.) through a silent arc O3 generator (Ozone Research and Equipment Corporation. Model OSV-0). and was monitored using continuous chemiluminescent analyzers (Bendix Model 8002) (RFOA-0 176). These analyzers were calibrated every 2 weeks using a uv standard. The Ox exposure consisted of a continuous background level of0.06 ppm. During the 5-day work week, a 9-hr \"ramped spike\" (maximum concentration, 0.25 ppm; integrated concentration, 0. I9 ppm) was added to the background exposure (Fig. I) . Animals and equipment were serviced daily during a 2-hr shutdown. On weekends the rats were exposed for 22 hr per day at the background level (0.06 ppm). The standard deviation for the peak part of the exposure was less than 4% of its mean at all times and that for the background portion did not exceed 2% of its mean concentration. During the I8-month exposure, a total of 40 hr of O3 exposure was missed due to mechanical problems.\n\nHistology. Rats were removed from the chambers and euthanized within 4 hr after their exposure was terminated. Lungs were fixed by infusing the fixative (2% glutaraldehyde in 0.085 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4) through a trachea1 cannula at a pressure of 20 cm HzO. The lungs were removed from the chest after 10 min of fixation inside the chest wall. They were immersed in the 2% glutaraldehyde fixative for 2 weeks before being trimmed free of other tissue. Measurement of lung volumes by fluid displacement was then performed. Three 2-mm thick slices were cut from the left lobe in a manner that divided the rest of the lobe into four pieces approximately equal in width (cranial to caudal direction). Each slice was cut into large blocks with approximately 4 X 4-mm faces. The blocks were mixed and then six to nine blocks from each slice were arbitrarily selected. They were embedded in Epox 8 12 with large molds with a random orientation. The random orientation of terminal bronchioles allowed them to be cut in a random direction with respect to the central axis of each terminal bronchiole.\n\nMicrodissection. Three blocks of epox-embedded lung tissue were selected arbitrarily, softened with mild heat, and cut into slices 0.3-0.5 mm thick. These slices were sequentially inspected under a dissecting microscope. Small airways were followed until they led into terminal bronchioles and proximal alveolar ducts. All the terminal bronchioles in one tissue block that were perpendicularly cut in cross section were isolated. One terminal bronchiole from each block was randomly selected for study. We defined the proximal alveolar region (PAR) as the alveolar tissue surrounding the alveolar ducts beginning at the bronchiolar-alveolar duct junction and ending FIG. I. Exposure regimen for the simulated ambient pattern of ozone. Rats were exposed to this regimen for 5 days each week. On weekends, the exposure consisted only of a 22 hr/day 0.06 ppm background. at the second alveolar duct bifurcation. Samples were taken at the approximate center of this region by taking them just distal to the proximal edge of the first alveolar duct bifurcation. We required that cross sections of the two first alveolar ducts be present in the section. All proximal alveolar regions contained in the series of embedded tissue slices that satisfied the definitions given above were isolated. Three terminal bronchioles and three proximal alveolar regions were used from each animal. Methods for microdissection have been described in detail by Chang and Crap0 (1990) .\n\nElectron microscopy. Blocks of PARS were trimmed to include only the alveolar septa surrounding the alveolar ducts. Ultrathin sections (-60 nm) were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Sections were examined with a Zeiss CM 10 electron microscope (EM) at 2000X. Photographs were taken at the upper left and lower right corner of each grid square, and the entire section was photographed. A montage of the entire bronchiolar epithelium was made for each terminal bronchiole. Micrographs were printed on 11 X 14 inch paper at a magnification of 8500x using a calibration grid .\n\nEM morphometry. The parameters measured in proximal alveolar regions in this study included the volumes of type I epithelium, type II epithelium, interstitial cells, interstitial matrix, and endothelium as well as alveolar cell characteristics (cell number, mean cell size, and mean cell-surface area). Because the absolute volume of proximal alveolar tissue cannot be easily measured, tissue volumes were expressed as the ratio of tissue volume density to surface density of the alveolar epithelial basement membrane . We have found that although the thickness of the basement membrane may change, its surface density was not altered significantly during these chronic Or exposures (Table 4) . It can be used as a Chang and Crapo, 1990) . Morphometric studies ofthe terminal bronchioles included measurement of the thickness of the bronchiolar epithelium and mean cell characteristics of the bronchiolar epithelial cells. The major terminal bronchiolar cells studied were ciliated cells, Clara cells, preciliated cells, and brush cells. All unidentified cell profiles were classified as \"other\" cells. Methods for the morphometry of terminal bronchiolar cells and morphological criteria used to identify them have been reported by and Chang et al. (1986) .\n\nStatistical unalyses. A large number of morphometric analyses were conducted on the terminal bronchiolar and proximal alveolar regions. In order to perform the statistical analyses on the most meaningful biological endpoints and to minimize the need for correcting results for multiple comparisons, primary variable groupings were defined a priori. The critical variables identified for changes in volumes, surface densities, surface areas, tissue thickness, and the characteristics of the major cell types are given in Tables 1 and 2. These sets of primary variables were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). The remaining variables which had not been identified in multivariate groupings as being primary, were analyzed only in univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\nThe factors of interest in the statistical analyses were pollutant exposure (air, 0,) and length of exposure including recovery, if done, (1. 3, 13, 19, 78, and 95 weeks). A two-factor ANOVA examined the effects of pollutant and length of exposure in a 2 X 6 design. For the primary variables, ANOVA tests were only examined if a significant MANOVA effect due to pollutant or to an interaction with pollutant was found. Significant ANOVA effects were further examined by using the ANOVA mean square error to test the least squares means via t tests with application of a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, as appropriate.\n\nMorphometric Anal.vsis ofthe Proximal Alveolar Region Table 3 lists the body weights and lung volumes as well as the cumulative exposure concentrations of the groups of rats exposed for 13 weeks, 13 weeks plus recovery, 78 weeks, and 78 weeks plus recovery to air and 03.

An acute increase in tissue volume after 1 week of exposure (+32%) returned toward baseline at three weeks (+4%), and then entered a phase of progressive increase through 13 (+ 19%) and 78 weeks (+23%) of exposure. Many of the changes induced by the subchronic and chronic exposures were reversed when rats were placed in clean air. Epithelium and interstitium were the major compartments of the septal wall tissue involved in these reactions. Analysis of variance indicated that there was a significant pollutant (p < 0.01) and time (a < 0.01) effects in the volumes of epithelium and interstitium.\n\nBoth alveolar type I and type II epithelia were involved in the response to 03. The volume of type I epithelium increased 16, 8, 35, and 17% after 1, 3, 13. and 78 weeks of exposure (Fig. 2 ) respectively. Ozone exposure had an overall effect on mean type I cell number per unit area of basement membrane (p < 0.01). Increased type I cell numbers of 28, 4 1, and 46% at 1, 13, and 78 weeks, respectively, were observed (Fig. 3) . These cells each covered a smaller alveolar surface area on the average. Although there was an apparent recovery in the total volume of type I epithelium at 3 weeks, the type I epithelium still consisted of more cells with less average surface area per cell. Chronic 0s exposure (78 weeks) caused an increase in the volume of type II epithelium (p < 0.01) with increases of 61, 42, and 9 1% after 1, 13, and 78 weeks of exposure (Fig. 2) , respectively. These increases were primarily the result of type II epithelial cell hyperplasia (p < 0.01). Type II cell number per unit area of basement membrane increased 29, 18, and 62%, respectively, after these exposures. The epithelial cell responses diminished when the animals were placed in clean air after either 13 weeks ( 19 weeks) or 78 weeks (95 weeks) of O3 inhalation.\n\nA biphasic response occurred in the interstitium after exposure to O3 (Fig. 4) . There was an overall pollutant effect on the volume of interstitium (p < 0.0 1) that involved both interstitial fibroblasts and interstitial matrix (p < 0.0 I). The volume of interstitial cells increased 53, 12, 14, and 2 1% after 1, 3, 13, and 78 weeks of exposure. The number and volume of interstitial macrophages increased approximately 60% but these changes were not statistically significant. The volume of interstitial matrix-which includes collagen, elastin, basement membrane, and the acellular ground substances-increased (p < 0.01) after 1, 13, and 78 weeks (33, 18, and 36%, respectively) of exposure to O3 (Fig. 4) . The changes manifested by interstitial cells largely resolved after a period of recovery in clean air. There was also a reduction of the increases in interstitial matrix during the recovery periods.\n\nCapillary endothelium showed no structural changes in response to O3 at any time during the chronic exposure. The volumes of the capillary lumen and endothelial cells were not changed. Endothelial cells demonstrated neither statistically significant changes in mean cell volume or number FIG. 5.

The ultrastructure of the type II epithelium appeared to remain normal. Areas of type II cell hyperplasia Alveolar Macrophages were observed at all time points, but were most evident after 78 weeks of exposure. A significant pollutant effect was found in the number of alveolar macrophages but there were no differences in the size of the cells. The only statistically significant change observed was a 108% increase in mean number per unit area of proximal alveolar surface after 1 week of exposure to 03. Few alveolar macrophages were found in the PAR after 3 and 13 weeks of exposure. A 49% increase in the number of alveolar macrophages was found after the 78-week exposure, but the change was not statistically significant.\n\nInterstitial edema was observed after 1 week of exposure to OS, but was resolved by 3 weeks. Although areas of collagen fiber deposition were found in rat lungs exposed for 13 weeks, the accumulation of collagen was not readily apparent until after 78 weeks of O3 treatment. Large bundles of collagen were observed frequently in the interstitium of alveolar duct bifurcations, or in the septum bordering alveolar ducts.

It also gives the numbers of terminal bronchiolar cells per square millimeter basement membrane and the mean cell luminal surface areas of ciliated and Clara cells. Terminal bronchioles had an average diameter of approximately 200 pm. The mean thickness of the epithelium was around 7.0 pm. A total of approximately 16,000 to 19,000 cuboidal epithelial cells were found per square millimeter of basement membrane in terminal bronchioles. These characteristics were not affected by the chronic exposure to Oj; however, the mean surface area of cilia on ciliated cells (p < 0.05) and mean luminal surface area of Clara cells (p < 0.01) were affected by both the pollutant and length of the exposure (Fig. 6) .\n\nOverall, the number of ciliated cells in terminal bronchioles decreased after chronic exposure to OX, but none of the differences at the individual time points were statistically significant. The average surface area of cilia per cell was reduced 27% after 78 weeks exposure (Fig. 6) . The average size of ciliated cells was found to range from 300 to 375 pm3 in all exposure groups, and no statistically significant changes in mean cell volume between exposed and control groups were observed.\n\nThe number of nonciliated (Clara) cells in terminal bronchioles was not changed by exposure to 03. The average cell volume of Clara cells ranged from 480-670 pm3. There was no difference between control and 03-exposed animals. The mean luminal surface area of Clara cells was decreased throughout the entire exposure. After exposure to the sim- ulated ambient pattern of O3 for 1, 3, 13, and 78 weeks, the luminal surface area was found to be 18, 15, 10, and 20% less than control values, respectively (Fig. 6) . The basement membrane surface of the Clara cell increased during O3 exposure (p < 0.05). However, except for an increase of 14% after 3 weeks of exposure, the changes were less than 10% above control values and were not statistically significant.\n\nPreciliated cells are a rare cell type in the terminal bronchiole (Barry et al., 1988) . They constitute less than 1% of the total cell population. Increased cell number and mean cell volume (air, 307 + 22 pm3; 03, 469 + 3 1 pm3) were observed in preciliated cells after 1 week of O3 exposure. These cell characteristics returned to normal by 3 weeks of exposure. Because the population size of these cells is small, 143 -t-l ' SA is airway luminal surface which includes surface for all cilia of ciliated cells and the dome surface area for Clara cells. All data are means i SE. * p i 0.05 for comparison to own control based on t test using least square means and the mean square error from the MANOVA.\n\nsmall changes in preciliated cell characteristics indicated large percentages of changes in effects, for example, the number of preciliated cells after 78 weeks of exposure was 56% higher than that of air-exposed animals, the change was not statistically significant.\n\nVery few structural alterations were observed in terminal bronchiolar cells of 03-exposed rats. After 78 weeks of exposure to the simulated ambient pattern of 03, ciliated cells displayed fewer cilia and Clara cells were found to have smaller dome protrusions.\n\nElectron microscopic morphometric analyses were conducted on groups of rats exposed to a simulated ambient pattern of O3 for up to 78 weeks. In addition to the progression of tissue and cell injury with long-term exposure, the effect of recovery in clean air was evaluated. Because of the low, realistic levels of O3 involved and the long duration of the study, the results are particularly relevant to the health effects of environmental 03. The proximal alveolar region was the major site of tissue injury. Cells in terminal bronchioles were also affected, but to a lesser degree. A biphasic response was found in the PAR which involved both the epithelial and interstitial compartments. Accumulation of interstitial matrix, primarily collagen and basement membrane, was detected after 78 weeks of exposure. While most cell reactions subsided when the animals were returned to clean air for substantial amounts of time, the changes in basement membrane did not resolve. Not all bronchiolar alveolar junctions in the rat lung were affected equally by the O3 exposure. Modeling of reactive gas uptake predicts -5% of the ventilatory units in the lung have a twofold greater and -5% have a twofold less than average O3 exposure per unit surface area in the PAR (Mercer et al., 199 1) . Our random sampling procedure may lead to undersampling of hot or cold spots. Nevertheless, when sufficient numbers of animals are studied, random sampling provides an accurate estimate of mean tissue responses.\n\nChanges induced in animals by brief exposures to O3 at concentrations from 0.2 to 1.0 ppm have been well documented (Barr et al., 1988; Boorman et al., 1980; Evans et al., 1985; Fujinaka et al., 1985; Schwartz et al., 1976; Stephens et al., 1974; Plopper et al., 1978 Plopper et al., , 1979 . They include influx of alveolar macrophages, thickening of the type I epithelium, hyperplasia of type II epithelial cells, and increases in the volume of interstitial matrix in the proximal alveolar region. These previous observations on relatively high levels of O3 or on low levels of O3 for relatively short periods of time led to the design of the current study which utilized a low-level chronic exposure to determine whether the tissue changes are progressive and whether they can be reversed after a chronic exposure is stopped. F344 rats were used since it is the standard strain used in chronic studies by the National Cancer Institute and the National Toxicology Program and because they exhibit relatively little lung growth during their adult life, thus providing a stable model for studies of chronic lung injury. It has been suggested that the F-344 rats may be less sensitive to O3 than are other commonly used rat strains (such as Sprague-Dawley or Wistar) and nonhuman primates (Plopper et al.. 199 1; Costa et al., 1992) . If F344 rats are more resistant to O3 than are humans the injury responses found with F344 rats may occur in humans at even lower Orexposure concentrations.\n\nThe epithelium is perhaps the most immediate target of O3 insult since O3 is highly reactive. Increased numbers of both type I and type II cells and a thickened type I epithelium were found after the chronic low-level exposure to 03. We noted that the magnitude of the epithelial cell response during the acute phase of the reactions appeared to be associated with the presence or absence of alveolar macrophages. This correlates with reports of epithelial cell injury and proliferation induced by proteases and inflammatory mediators released by macrophages (Hurst and Coffin, 1971; Leslie et al., 1986; Ring et al., 1990) . Alternately, the apparent recovery of epithelial injury after 3 weeks of exposure may be related to increases in epithelial cell antioxidant defenses following the initial exposure (Mustafa and Lee, 1976; Plopper et al., 1979) . Studies of antioxidant enzymes in whole lung homogenates and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of another cohort of rats in the same chronic study have shown increases in glutathione-related enzyme activities and/or ascorbate and tocopherol levels at 12 and 18 months of exposure (Jaskot et al., 1989; Norwood et al., 1989) .\n\nThe alveolar interstitium was another major site of 03induced tissue reactions. The acute responses consisted of an influx of interstitial macrophages, fibroblast hypertrophy, and interstitial edema. Deposition of increased amounts of interstitial matrix was found by 13 weeks of exposure. The matrix deposition included basement membranes and most likely also interstitial collagen. Epithelial cells, including type II cells, have been shown to synthesize the components of basement membrane in vitro (Zimmerman et al., 1985) . Whether the thickened basement membrane was synthesized by differentiating type II cells as they replaced injured type I epithelium or whether the process also involved type I epithelial cells is unknown.\n\nMorphological detection of collagen fibers in the PAR after O3 exposure has been reported in a number of studies (Boorman et al.. 1980; Plopper et al., 1978 Plopper et al., , 1979 Schwartz et al.. 1976; . An increase in total lung collagen content and in the rate of collagen synthesis was reported in rats exposed to >0.5 ppm O3 (Last and Greenberg, 1980; Last et al., 1983 Last et al., , 1984 Bhatnagar et al., 1983; Wright et al.. 1988 ) as well as in rats exposed to as low as 0.1 ppm 03 (Warren and Last, 1987) . In our study, an increased volume of interstitial matrix was not found until 13 weeks of exposure. EM morphological examination of the matrix sug-Air Ozone , : . L * J !. FIG. 7 . A summary of lung injuries following chronic exposure to the simulated ambient pattern of ozone. In the terminal bronchiole the sizes of the dome of Clara cells become smaller and the number of cilia is reduced (arrows). In the proximal alveolar region the epithelium becomes thicker and accumulation of collagen fibers occurs (arrowheads).\n\ngests that substantial collagen deposition did not occur at Fibroblast proliferation and collagen production are this time. By 78 weeks the accumulation of collagen could thought to be caused mainly by cytokines released by inbe discerned qualitatively.\n\nflammatory cells such as alveolar macrophages (King et al., 1990 ). In the present study, increased numbers of macrophages were present only at the beginning and disappeared 3 weeks into the exposure, long before the increase in interstitial matrix was detected. Active involvement of alveolar macrophage in the development of the localized fibrosis seemed unlikely. Recently bronchiolar epithelial cells have been shown to express, intensely, the mRNA message of transforming growth factor (Pelton et al., 199 I) , an important growth factor that regulates extracellular matrix synthesis (Fine and Goldstein, 1987) . We have found a hyperplastic and hypertrophic epithelium occurring in combination with matrix accumulation during chronic O3 exposure. The 03induced interstitial injury and repair may be regulated in part by epithelium-derived cytokines or growth factors in the absence of activation by alveolar macrophages. It has been known that epithelial-interstitial interactions exist in the developing lung (Brody, 1985) . Tissue injury and repair often involve mechanisms similar to those occurring in growth (King et al., 1990) .\n\nTerminal bronchioles have been reported to be a major site of 03-induced lesions. Injuries described include loss of cilia, reduction of the height of Clara cells, proliferation of Clara cells, and remodeling of the terminal airways or bronchiolization (Boorman et al., 1980; Freeman et al., 1973; Schwartz et al., 1976; Barr et al., 1988; Lum et al., 1978) . Similar changes were observed in the present study, except we did not find significant bronchiolization.\n\nThe initial exposure caused loss of cilia and changes in Clara cell surface area. That Clara cells displayed a reduction in dome surface after 3 weeks of exposure while ciliated and preciliated cells returned to normal suggests either that ciliated cells adapt to O3 toxicity while Clara cells do not, or that there was continued cell loss and differentiation but the cell population balance was restored. With chronic exposure, a significant loss of cilia on ciliated cells was noted. Ozone-induced cell injury in the terminal bronchioles was reversible upon return to clean air. Figure 7 summarizes the changes that were found after 78 weeks of exposure to a simulated ambient pattern of 03. In the terminal bronchioles, cilia were lost and the size of the domes of Clara cells was reduced. In the proximal alveolar region, epithelium was thickened and deposition of interstitial matrix occurred. An important question is whether or not these structural alterations are likely to result in significant functional impairment. Parallel lung function studies have revealed a significant OX-induced increase in expiratory resistance particularly after 78 weeks of exposure (Tepper ef al., 199 1) . Small but significant decreases in lung volume and enhanced nitrogen washout kinetics were also found (Costa, personal communication) that are consistent with the fibrotic lesions reported herein. Local and systemic immune functions were apparently unaffected by the chronic Oj exposure (Selgrade et al., 1990) . Pinkerton et al. (1989) reported that rats exposed to the same simulated ambient pattern of O3 for 6 weeks followed by a 5-hr exposure to asbestos fibers retained three times as much fibers in their lungs as did control rats exposed only to the asbestos fibers. Warren and Last ( 1987) had demonstrated that exposure to O3 and sulfuric acid aerosol simultaneously produced synergistic effects on the rate of collagen synthesis. The impact of even minor O3 effects should not be underestimated because O3 may interact with other airborne pollutants such as cigarette smoke, silica, and particulates to produce additive or synergistic injuries. It should be noted that human beings are commonly exposed for far longer periods than were the animals in this study, and that the relative sensitivity of humans in comparison to F-344 rats remains uncertain. Tyler et al. ( 1987) found that lung growth and development in young rats exposed to O3 for 42 nights were altered and that these changes persisted after O3 inhalation was stopped. The effects of O3 on lung structure described in this study appear to be adverse and suggest that long-term functional impairment and lung disease could result from inhalation of air polluted with 03."}
