Summary 18!\n\nHeat shock triggers an instant reprogramming of gene and enhancer transcription, but whether 20! cells encode a memory to stress, at the level of nascent transcription, has remained unknown.\n\nHere, we measured transcriptional response to acute heat stress in unconditioned cells and in 22! daughters of cells that had been exposed to a single or multiple heat shocks. Tracking RNA 23! Polymerase II (Pol II) genome-wide at nucleotide-resolution revealed that cells precisely 24! remember their transcriptional identity throughout stress, restoring Pol II distribution at gene 25! bodies and enhancers upon recovery. However, single heat shock primed faster gene-induction in 26! the daughter cells by increasing promoter-proximal Pol II pausing, and accelerating the pause-27! release. In repeatedly stressed cells, both basal and inducible transcription was refined, and pre-28! mRNA processing decelerated, which retained transcripts on chromatin and reduced recycling of Heat shock is one of the most potent triggers of transcription reprogramming, provoking an 47! instant and genome-wide change in RNA synthesis from genes and enhancers (reviewed in 48! Vihervaara et al., 2018) . Upon heat shock, hundreds of genes are rapidly induced by potent trans-49! activators, such as Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1). When activated, HSF1 binds to Heat Shock 50! Elements (HSEs) at architecturally primed promoters and enhancers (Rougvie and Lis, 1988; 51! Rasmussen and Lis, 1993; Guertin and Lis, 2010; Ray et al., 52! 2019) , and it can trigger the release of promoter-proximally paused Pol II into productive 53! elongation Mahat et al., 2016) . Concomitantly with the heat-induced escape 54! of Pol II from the promoters of activated genes, thousands of genes are repressed via inhibition of 55! the pause-release. This repression leads to the accumulation Pol II at promoter-proximal regions 56! and clears transcription complexes from gene bodies Vihervaara et al., 57! 2017) . As a consequence of the genome-wide re-coordination of Pol II pause-release, heat-58! stressed cells promptly switch their transcription program to produce chaperones and protect 59! cellular integrity. 60!\n\nStress responses are evolutionarily conserved and robustly activated. Yet, severe stress can have 62! long-lasting consequences for an individual (Guan et al., 2002; Sailaja et al., 2012) and cause 63! physiological changes over several generations (Kaati et al., 2002; Wei et al., 2014; reviewed in 64! Heard and Martienssen, 2014) . On a cellular level, various stresses have been associated with 65! long-term changes in the chromatin state (Guan et al., 2002; Tetievsky and Horowitch, 2010; 66! Sailaja et al., 2012; D'Urso et al., 2016; L\u00e4mke et al., 2016; reviewed in D'Urso and Brickner, 67! 2017) , and shown to confer thermotolerance against protein misfolding via increased chaperone 68! expression (Gerner and Schneider, 1975; Maytin et al., 1990; Yost and Lindquist, 1991) . To date, 69! however, stress-induced long-term changes in gene expression have been investigated from 70! steady-state RNA and protein expression, which do not quantify processes of nascent 71! transcription or reveal mechanistic control of Pol II. Besides chaperone expression, acquired 72! stress resistance is commonly assessed as improved cell viability. Since apoptosis is the final 73! stage of failed proteostasis and involves radical changes in cellular physiology, evaded cell death 74!\n\nis not an appropriate stage to track control of nascent transcription that underlies the onset of 75! stress resistance. Consequently, we do not yet know whether cells restore or adjust their program 76! ! ! 5! of RNA synthesis when recovering from heat stress, and whether nascent transcription profile can 77! encode a memory to previously encountered proteotoxicity. 78!\n\nIn this study, we used heat shock to provoke a genome-wide change in gene and enhancer 80! transcription, and asked whether proteotoxic stress reprograms nascent transcription and 81! transcriptional responsiveness over mitotic divisions. To map RNA synthesis at nucleotide 82! resolution, we used Precision Run-On sequencing (PRO-seq) that tracks incorporation of a single 83! biotinylated nucleotide at the active site of each nascent transcript (Kwak et al., 2013) .\n\nConsequently, PRO-seq provides genome-wide maps of transcribing Pol II complexes at genes 85! and enhancers, and identifies regulatory decisions at high fidelity and spatio-temporal resolution 86! (reviewed in Wissink et al., invited manuscript under review). As cell models, we used Mouse 87! Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) and human K562 erythroleukemia cells that reprogram 88! transcription upon heat shock with highly similar mechanisms Vihervaara et 89! al., 2017) . We found that transcriptional reprogramming by heat shock is followed by precise 90! restoration of basal cell type-specific transcription program of genes and enhancers. \n\nTo address whether heat-induced reprogramming of RNA synthesis is followed by restoration or 106! readjustment of transcription, we measured nascent RNA synthesis in MEFs upon a 1-hour heat 107! shock, and after a 4-hour or a 48-hour recovery (Figure 1 ). DNA staining and Fluorescence 108! Associated Cell Sorting (FACS) verified that MEFs proliferated over the acute heat shock and 109! also following recovery, and they did not undergo cell cycle arrest or apoptosis ( Figure S1A ). For 110! accurate normalization of PRO-seq data, we used whole-genome spike-in from Drosophila S2 111! cells ( Figure S1B , see Materials and Methods for details), and pooled biological replicates for 112! data analyses after validating their high correlation ( Figure S1C ). As previously reported (Mahat 113! et al., 2016; , a single heat shock caused a robust induction of hundreds 114! and repression of thousands of genes, simultaneously accumulating Pol II at divergently 115! transcribed distal Transcription Regulatory Elements (dTREs), hereon called enhancers (Figure 116! 1A). During a 4-hour recovery, the genome-wide profile of gene and enhancer transcription was 117! precisely restored to the level observed prior to the heat shock ( Figure 1A -B), which demarcates 118! high plasticity and accurate recovery of the transcription program. Despite the full recovery of 119! gene body transcription, certain promoter-proximal regions gained new pause sites, as 120! exemplified by Heat Shock Protein H1 (Hsph1 alias Hsp110) gene ( Figure 1B ). Moreover, a 121! subset of heat-responsive genes either gained ( Figure S1D ) or retained ( Figure S1E ) high Pol II 122! density at a single pause site during the recovery. Consequently, the genome-wide average of Pol 123! II at the pause region remained elevated, even when measured in the daughter cells, 48 hours 124! after the heat exposure ( Figure 1C ). 125!\n\nSince individual genes and whole transcription programs can be coordinated at the promoter-128! proximal pause-release (Rougvie and Lis, 1988; Boettiger and Levine, 2009; Mahat et al., 2016; 129! Vihervaara et al., 2017) , we addressed whether the changed pausing pattern in daughter cells 130! alters genes' heat responsiveness. We preconditioned MEFs with a single 1-hour heat shock, and 131! allowed a 48-hour recovery before measuring transcription kinetics provoked by an additional 132! heat shock. To capture instant and sustained changes in heat-induced transcription, we conducted 133! ! ! 7! heat-induced genes, such as Ubc that encodes polyubiquitin ( Figure 2B ), gained promoter-136! proximal Pol II pausing during preconditioning (0-minute inset in Figure 2B ), and released the 137! paused Pol II faster into elongation upon heat shock (12.5-minute inset in Figure 2B ). By 40 138! minutes of heat shock, unconditioned cells also had gained high Ubc transcription and efficient 139! Pol II pause-release ( Figure 2B ), suggesting that preconditioning accelerated the onset, rather 140! than changed the overall level of transcription. The faster activation was also demonstrated by 141! heat-induced waves of Pol II progression: For example at Vinculin (Vcl) gene, the advancing 142! wave of transcription had proceeded farther during the 12.5-minute heat shock in preconditioned 143! than in unconditioned cells ( Figure 2C ). This transiently activated gene had returned to its basal 144! expression by 40 minutes of heat shock, regardless of the preconditioning ( Figure 2C ). 145! Importantly, Vcl did not show higher pausing in preconditioned cells (0-minute inset of Figure  146 ! 2C), but the altered usage of promoter-proximal pause sites and the lower pausing signal upon 147! heat stress (insets of Figure 2C ) indicated faster kinetics of Pol II when proceeding from its 148! promoter-proximal pause to productive elongation.! 149!\n\nTo examine whether the faster release of Pol II into productive elongation served as a general 152! mechanism for accelerated induction, we compared transcription programs upon heat shock 153! between unconditioned and preconditioned cells. The instant 12.5-minute heat shock showed the 154! highest variation in gene expression due to preconditioning ( Figure S2A ), which supports 155! observations from individual genes that preconditioning with a single heat shock primarily 156! affected the onset of the transcriptional response (Figure 2B-C; Figure S2B ). Noteworthy is that 157! these changes in nascent RNA synthesis, as measured at the steps of initiation, pause-release and 158! ongoing elongation, can only be detected with assays that directly track engaged Pol II complexes 159! Figure S2A ). This pattern of engaged Pol II molecules demonstrated faster progression of 169! Pol II from initiation into elongation in the daughters of heat-shocked cells. Importantly, we did 170! not detect preconditioning to accelerate heat responsiveness of genes that were instantly activated 171! already in unconditioned cells ( Figure S2C ). Neither was kinetics of the classical heat shock 172! genes changed ( Figure S2D ). Consequently, preconditioning with a single heat shock did not 173! globally reduce response time, but primed an additional set of genes for a rapid heat-induction. 174!\n\nGenes that gained accelerated heat induction by preconditioning were enriched for lysosomal, 178! autophagocytosis and membrane-associated functions ( Figure 2E ), suggesting their role in 179! acquired stress resistance. Genes with faster repression, instead, contained classical heat-180! repressed genes that are highly expressed under non-181! stress conditions and involved in transcription, translation, and cell-cell junctions ( Figure 2E ).\n\nAcross their promoter-proximal ( Figure 2D ) and gene body ( Figure S2A ) regions, genes with 183! faster repression showed modestly lower Pol II density in heat-shocked preconditioned cells, 184! which demonstrates fewer Pol II molecules engaging into their transcription. This reduced 185! initiation could be indirectly caused by limited Pol II availability, as a larger fraction of Pol II 186! molecules were instantly engaged into transcription of heat-activated genes. Taken together, our 187! results in singly heat shock-conditioned MEFs demonstrated that cells precisely remembered 188! their transcriptional identity throughout an acute heat shock, but that they also simultaneously 189! pre-wired an additional set of genes for a more rapid induction in the daughter cells. 190!\n\nPathophysiological stresses, such as those encountered during cancer progression and 193! neurodegeneration, are often sustained or repeated. To be able to investigate how repeatedly 194! encountered stress affects gene and enhancer transcription, we moved from stress-sensitive MEFs 195! to human K562 erythroleukemia cells. K562 cells are a patient-derived cancer cell line (Lozzio 196! and Lozzio, 1975; Koeffler and Kolde, 1980) , known to tolerate extended heat treatments and 197! develop thermotolerance (Mivecchi, 1989; . We preconditioned K562 198! cells with a series of heat shocks, giving a total nine 1-hour heat treatments during three 199! consecutive days, and allowed for a 48-hour recovery before measuring transcriptional response 200! to an additional single heat shock ( Figure 3A ). It is important to note that K562 cells proliferated 201! ! ! 9! throughout the six days of preconditioning, recovery and additional heat shock ( Figure S3A \n\nHeat-responsiveness was restored for the vast majority of genes in preconditioned K562 cells 226! ( Figure 3B ), but a subset of genes lost, gained or accelerated heat induction due to 227! preconditioning ( Figure 3E ). One of the genes that had lost heat induction encodes Protein 228! Phosphatase 1 Regulatory subunit 15A (PPP1R15A alias GADD34; Figure 3E ) that counteracts 229! stress-induced inhibition of translation by dephosphorylating eukaryote Initiation Factor 2 alpha 230! (eIF2\u03b1; Harding et al., 2009; Walter and Ron, 2011) . In support of inhibited protein synthesis in 231! preconditioned cells, the few genes that had gained heat induction included proteins with function 232! in cell survival and growth arrest (Supplementary Dataset 1). Albeit certain genes gained 233! accelerated heat induction ( Figure 3E ), we did not detect increased Pol II density at the promoter-234! ! ! 10! proximal regions ( Figure S3F ), as was detected in MEFs ( Figure 1C ) after a 48-hour recovery 235! from stress. On the contrary, 5'-sequences of heat-induced genes gained less Pol II in 236! preconditioned K562 cells upon heat shock ( Figure 3F ). The differences in Pol II entry into heat-237! activated genes indicated either cell-type specificity, or more likely, diverging strategies to re-238! wire transcriptional responsiveness in cells that were exposed to either a single or multiple heat 239! shocks. \n\nAlternatively, promoter-proximal pause-release has been shown to drive new initiation (Gressel 283! et al., 2017) , which might bring the transcription machinery also to functionally connected 284! enhancers. In preconditioned cells, the heat-induced recruitment of Pol II to HSF1-dependent 285! enhancers was diminished ( Figure 5B ; Figure S4D ), which resembled the reduced initiation 286! detected at heat-induced promoters ( Figure 3F ; Figure The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/576959 doi: bioRxiv preprint ! ! 12!\n\nwe searched for genes with simultaneously reduced 5' and increased 3' density in heat-shocked 301! preconditioned cells. The identified 415 genes ( Figure 6A ) comprised almost exclusively of 302! genes that either gained (heat-induced genes) or retained (unchanged or heat-repressed genes) 303! high transcription upon heat shock ( Figure 6B -C, Figure S5C ), which coupled the prolonged 3' 304! residency in preconditioned cells to high gene activity. The increased Pol II density in 305! preconditioned cells was confined to 4 kb downstream of the CPS ( Figure 4C ; Figure 6A) Figure S3E ). 311!\n\nThe prolonged residence time of Pol II at the CPSs, together with decreased initiation at heat-314! activated genes and enhancers, suggested reduced recycling of the transcription machinery from 315! the ends of active genes to heat-induced transcription. To examine the status of Pol II and 316! processing of transcripts at 5'-and 3'-ends of genes, we analyzed the length distribution of PRO-317! seq reads that overlap either with the transcription start site (TSS) or CPS. In essence, Pol II that 318! undergoes initiation or pausing has transcribed through fewer nucleotides (<60 nt) than the 319! sequenced read length in our PRO-seq data (75 nt). Thereby, the TSS-containing reads report, 320! besides the initiating base (5'-end of the read), also the active site of transcription (3'-end of the 321! read) of each individual transcript ( Figure 6D ; Rasmussen et al. 1993; Nechaev et al., 2010; 322! Tome et al., 2018) . The lower density of promoter-proximal Pol II that was detected after heat 323! shock in preconditioned cells ( Figure 6A ; Figure S5B ), comprised of transcripts with the whole 324! spectrum of PRO-seq read lengths (20 nt to 75 nt), which indicates less initiating, pausing and 325! early elongating Pol II complexes ( Figure 6D ). This reduction in all promoter-proximal Pol II 326! states can be explained by less Pol II molecules engaging into transcription at gene promoters. 327!\n\nAt the region intimately downstream of the CPS, the read length provides a measure of transcript 329! cleavage: Reads that are shorter than 75 nt represent transcripts that have been cleaved to release 330! the pre-mRNA ( Figure 6D ). After the cleavage, the uncapped nascent transcript is targeted by 5'-331! 3' exoribonuclease that degrades the RNA until reaching Pol II and transcription terminates 332! (reviewed by Proudfoot, 2009 ). Measuring the read lengths downstream of the CPS revealed that 333! ! ! 13! the genome-wide increase in Pol II density at the 3'-ends of genes ( Figure 6A ; Figure S5B ) 334! comprised almost exclusively of reads with the maximum length of 75 nt ( Figure 6D ). This 335! selective increase in transcription complexes with no signs of cleavage indicated that the 336! decelerated progression of Pol II at the CPS co-occurred with reduced RNA processing. Taken (Waddington, 1957; reviewed in Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2015) .\n\nReversing from a differentiated to pluripotent cell, instead, requires specific transcription factors 350! that push the cell up the energy landscape, which rarely occurs in nature (Gurdon et al., 1958; 351! Takahashi and Yamanaka 2006) . In this study, we showed that after genome-wide 352! reprogramming of transcription by heat shock, cells robustly return to their cell type-specific 353! transcription program within hours of recovery ( Figure 1 ). In Waddington's landscape, the heat-354! induced reprogramming of thousands of genes would be analogous with the cell transiently 355! occupying a near-by valley, but during recovery, returning to its cell type-specific basal 356! transcription program without acquiring new functions or committing to differentiation. This 357! rapidly reprogrammed and precisely recovered transcription of genes and enhancers highlights 358! the plasticity of transcription program, and implies that the transcriptional heat shock response is 359! truly transient.\n\nThe ability of a cell to rapidly and robustly restore its cell type-specific transcription after heat 362! shock is mechanistically explained by the genome-wide control of promoter-proximal Pol II 363! pause-release. An important consequence of repressing thousands of genes by preventing the 364! release of Pol II from their promoter-proximal regions is its rapid reversibility; a simple re-365! activation of the pause-release can restore productive gene transcription genome-wide without 366! extensive chromatin remodeling. In this regard, Pol II pausing can be considered as one form of a 367! which is unlikely to cause permanent or long-lasting damage to the cell, did not change the basal 386! transcription, but it increased Pol II pausing ( Figure 1 ). Moreover, a single heat shock accelerated 387! heat-induced transcription in the daughter cells by allowing more efficient progression of Pol II 388! through the pause-region (Figure 2 ). This faster responsiveness without a change in the basal 389! transcription mechanistically explains how cells can retain a memory of previously encountered 390! stress to prepare their daughter cells for protection against proteotoxicity (Figure 7) . 391!\n\nHallmarks of cancer cells include high stress-tolerance and active proliferation even in the 393! presence of sustained stress (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011) . In accordance, human K562 394! erythroleukemia cells proliferated through multiple heat shocks that challenge the proteome 395! integrity ( Figure S3 ). The persistence of protein-damaging stress in the daughters of repeatedly 396! stressed K562 cells was reflected in their transcriptional profile; two mitotic divisions after nine 397! heat exposures, transcription of certain pro-survival genes was elevated, whereas expression of 398! genes that are involved in maintaining protein production was decreased (Figure 3 ). The declined 399! synthesis of protein production machinery was accompanied with reduced processing of 400! transcripts at the 3'-ends of active genes ( Figure 6 ). In cells with decreased protein synthesis, the 401! decelerated transcription termination likely serves to reduce the mRNA load, as less pre-mRNA 402! is released from the chromatin, and fewer Pol II molecules become available for new rounds of 403! heat-induced transcription (Figure 7) . Moreover, increased association of uncleaved transcripts at 404! the 3'-ends of genes could provide a reservoir of pre-mRNAs that are rapidly processed to mature 405! mRNAs once proteotoxicity is relieved and the cell restores its protein synthesis. This regulatory 406! step at the 3'-end of the gene would be particularly important to instantly restore production of 407! ! ! 16! mRNAs from long genes, where transcription, proceeding on average 2.5 kb/minute (Jonkers et 408! al., 2014) , can take hours to complete after the Pol II pause-release. Intriguingly, the mechanisms 409! that primed gene activation and refined transcription over mitotic divisions were mediated via 410! regulation of Pol II, but they were not detected to involve altered activity of HSF1 (Figure 4 ; 411! Figure 7 ). Taken together, in cells exposed to either single or multiple heat shocks, the re-wiring 412! EtOH-precipitation, the RNA was air-dried, base hydrolyzed with 0.1 N NaOH for 5 minutes on 476! ice, and the NaOH was neutralized with Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). Unincorporated nucleotides were 477! removed using P-30 columns (Bio-Rad), and the biotinylated nascent transcripts were isolated in 478! a total of three rounds of streptavidin-coated magnetic bead (M-280, Invitrogen) purifications.\n\nEach of the bead binding was followed by Trizol extraction and EtOH-precipitation of the 480! transcripts. The 5\u2032-cap was removed with RNA 5' Pyrophosphohydrolase (Rpph, NEB), and 481! the 5\u2032-hydroxyl group was repaired with T4 polynucleotide kinase (BioLabs). The libraries 482! were generated using TruSeq small-RNA adaptors and sequenced using NextSeq500 483! The PRO-seq reads were adapter-clipped using cutadapt (Martin, 2011) normalization vector in each sample, we spiked-in the same amount of non-treated Drosophila 518! S2 cells (isolated nuclei or permeabilized cells) to each run-on reaction. Since run-on reaction 519! adds biotinylated nucleotides to transcripts regardless of the species, this spike-in material 520! follows through the biochemical and data-analytical steps of PRO-seq. Consequently, the 521! spike-in material provides a read-out of uniquely mapped reads to the Drosophila genome, 522! against which the sample data can be normalized. When mapping the data, we combined the 523! sample genome with the Drosophila genome (hg19-dm3 or mm10-dm3), and retained the 524! reads that uniquely mapped to the sample genome (hg19 or mm10) or the spike-in genome 525! (dm3). 526!\n\nNormalization with spike-in reads demonstrated highly similar transcription profiles in 528! unconditioned and preconditioned cells ( Figure S1B ; Figure S3C ). This allowed us to utilize 529! also samples generated in our previous study ; GSE71708) that highly 530! correlated (rho=0.96) with the data generated in this study ( Figure S1H ). Since our earlier data 531! did not have spike-in reads we utilized the ends of long genes when normalizing samples 532! between distinct datasets. As described in Mahat et al. (2016) were retained. The level of transcription per each transcript was measured from the gene body 546! (+500 nt from TSS to -500 nt from CPS), as described previously 547! Vihervaara et al., 2017) . In the downstream analyses, we retained a single transcript per gene 548! by selecting the isoform that showed the largest fold change to heat shock, or if called 549! unresponsive to heat stress, had the highest level of transcription in non-stress condition.

To call transcribed enhancers across the genome, dREG gateway 557! \n\nTo call significant changes in gene and enhancer transcription, we utilized DESeq2 (Love et 571! al., 2014) , which uses the variance in biological replicates to assess significant changes 572! between conditions. Differential gene expression was quantified using gene body 573! Figure S5B ), conducting DESeq2 using the same time point from unconditioned and 590! preconditioned cells as a replicate pair. These analyses showed 227 genes and 496 enhancers 591! to be HSF1 dependent in both unconditioned and preconditioned K562 cells ( Figure S4B) .\n\nSince a subset of genes changed basal or heat-inducible transcription due to preconditioning, 593! we complemented the DESeq2-analysis by calling genes that showed HSF1-dependency only 594! in unconditioned or preconditioned cells, or that were called insignificant due to changes in 595! basal transcription. Since HSF1-dependency of the 227 DESeq2-called genes ranged from 596! 64.1% to 99.9% ( Figure S4B ), we queried genes that in either unconditioned or preconditioned 597! cells were HSF1-dependent at least to 64.1%, gained at least two-fold heat-induction, and had 598! a minimum gene body transcription of 50 RPK in any condition. This analysis identified 18 599! additional HSF1-dependent genes, including PPP1R15A that had lost heat-inducibility, and 600! HSPA8 that had gained higher basal transcription, upon preconditioning. All of the 18 genes 601! were individually verified to be HSF1-dependent by browsing. 602!\n\nPol II densities as bigWig and bedgraph files were visualized with Integrative Genomics 605! Viewer (IGV; Thorvaldsd\u00f3ttir et al., 2013) and an in-house browser (Hojoong Kwak, Cornell 606! University, Ithaca, NY, USA). The read counts in defined genomic regions were obtained, and 607! composite profiles generated using bigWig package 608! (https://github.com/andrelmartins/bigWig/). The average intensities in composite profiles were 609! queried in 20-nt, 10-nt or 1-nt bins. The shaded areas display 12.5-87.5% fractions of the data 610! in each queried window. To generate an average profile of gene bodies with different lengths, 611! 1/500th of the gene body length was set to the bin size, after filtering out short genes where 612! the bin would have been less than 1 nt. To identify genes with decreased Pol II density in 5'-and increased density in 3'-region, genes 616! were first divided into three distinct regions: 1) 5'-coding region comprising 1000 nt 617! downstream of the mid coordinate between Pol II pause sites of divergent transcription, 2) 618! gene body, measured from +1000 nt from the mid of the pause sites to -1000 nt from the CPS, 619! and 3) downstream, +100 nt to +6000 nt, of the CPS. PRO-seq reads in each region were 620! measured, after which the read count in the preconditioned 60-minute heat shock sample was 621! deduced from the respective read count in the unconditioned 60-minute heat shock sample.\n\nSince gene body transcription varies from gene to gene, we compared the change in Pol II 623! progression within each gene. To identify genes with reduced 5'-and increased 3'-Pol II 624! density, we required the reduction at 5'-coding region to be three times larger than the 625! absolute change in the gene body read count. Simultaneously, the increase in read counts 626! downstream of the CPS was required to be three times higher than the absolute change in the 627! gene body read count. 628!\n\nThe mapped reads were sorted to distinct genomic regions by intersecting the 3'-coordinate of 631! the read with the genomic coordinates described in Supplementary Figure 5A . To avoid double 632! mapping, gene body reads that overlapped with enhancers or pause regions were omitted.\n\nSubsequently, the number of reads in a given region was counted as fraction of total uniquely 634! mapping reads in the PRO-seq data.
