{"title": "Toward the discovery of dual HCMV-VZV inhibitors: Synthesis, structure activity relationship analysis, and cytotoxicity studies of long chained 2-uracil-3-yl-N-(4-phenoxyphenyl)acetamides", "body": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV, or human herpesvirus-5) and varicella zoster virus (VZV, also known as human herpesvirus-3) belong to the viral family known as Herpesviridae. Despite modern prevention and treatment strategies, they remain a common opportunistic pathogen associated with serious morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised individuals such as transplant recipients 1 and AIDS patients. 2, 3 All drugs currently licensed for the treatment of HCMV and VZV infections ( Fig. 1) target the viral DNA polymerase. Unfortunately they are associated with severe toxicity issues, including marrow toxicity for ganciclovir, valganciclovir, and cidofovir, and renal toxicity for foscarnet and cidofovir. 4, 5 The emergence of drug resistance is also a significant problem. 6 Moreover, our understanding of the full spectrum of risks of HCMV infection and its interactions with the host immune system remains far from complete. 7 While the past two decades have seen progress toward novel treatments for herpesviruses, the need for better drugs that exhibit an improved toxicity profile persists. 8 Previously, we have described a series of 1-[x-(phenoxy)alkyl] uracil derivatives that were found to exhibit high specificity and promising inhibitory activity against HCMV replication in HEL cell cultures with EC 50 values within 5.5-12 lM range. 9 These results provided strong impetus to further explore structure-activity relationships and the antiviral activity spectrum of similar scaffolds. The present paper describes lead development of N-(4-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide derivatives (Fig. 2 ).\n\nThe synthesis of the compound library relied on three key steps: synthesis of 1-[x-(phenoxy)alkyl]uracil derivatives and related compounds, synthesis of 2-chloro-N-(4-phenoxyphenyl) acetamides, and their subsequent conjugation to realize the target compounds. Based on the successful synthesis of several previously reported compounds, 9 a series of analogs were synthesized following the classical synthetic approach reported in Scheme 1. This first set of derivatives is characterized by focused modifications on the aromatic ring. The synthesis of compounds 4a-j started from commercially available phenols 1 (R 1 4-Ph or 4-CN), which were treated with 4-fold excess of a,x-dibromoalkanes 2 (n = 1-4, 6 or 8) to produce bromides 3a-i according to known procedures. [10] [11] [12] A modified silyl Hilbert-Johnson reaction, that is, condensation of equimolar amounts of 2,4-bis (trimethylsilyloxy)pyrimidines 13 with bromides 3a-e, was performed at 160-170\u00b0C in the absence of solvent 9 to afford target compounds 4a-e in 76-88% yield. Compounds 4f-j comprising 3, 4, 6, and 8 methylene units, respectively, were obtained in an analogous manner as was used for compounds 4a-e (Scheme 1).\n\nIntermediate 2-chloroacetamides 6a-c were readily obtained via acylation of the commercially available 4-(phenoxy)-(5a), 4-(benzyloxy)-(5b) and 4-benzyl-(5c) anilines with chloroacetyl chloride promoted by anhydrous K 2 CO 3 in aprotic media. 14 2-Chloroacetamide 6d was obtained as we described previously. 15 Treatment of potassium salts of uracil derivatives 4a-j with 2-chloroacetamides 6a-d in anhydrous DMF afforded target compounds 7a-i and 7k-m in good yields (Scheme 2). To avoid possible complications due to iodine elimination, compound 7j was obtained from 4j and 2-chloroacetamide 6a employing NaH as the base. 16 Target compound 7j was subsequently isolated in 86% yield. 15 In order to obtain benzophenone derivative 9, the appropriate building blocks were obtained in a somewhat different order. First, acid 8 was synthesized quantitatively via treatment of 4b with ethyl bromoacetate in the presence of K 2 CO 3 , followed by hydrolysis using LiOH according to published procedures. 17 Subsequent conversion of acid 8 into the corresponding acyl chloride, followed by condensation with the N-trimethylsilyl derivative of 4-(benzoyl)aniline led to 9 in 57% yield (Scheme 3). 15 It should be noted that utilization of base-free conditions for the synthesis of 9 avoids the by-products that typically arise from Knoevenagel condensation between the benzophenone carbonyl and the active methylene of the acetic acid residue. 18 To further explore the SAR of these compounds, we then designed a second set of analogs featuring a modified spacer linking the N 1 of the uracil with the aromatic moiety. Synthesis of the various target structures demanded different, but related approaches. Copper-catalyzed coupling of phenylmagnesium bromide (10) with excess of 1,6-dibromohexane 19 in THF media produced bromide 11, which was condensated with 2,4-bis (trimethylsilyloxy)pyrimidine to afford 1-(6-phenylhexyl)uracil (12) , however in an unexpectedly mediocre 30% yield (Scheme 4). This was somewhat surprising since our previous observations for this reaction involving similar x-(phenoxy)alkyl bromides 3a-i as alkylating agents were, in contrast, quite efficient. 9 Silyl Hilbert-Johnson reactions between 2,4-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)pyrimidine and alkyl bromides are known to be associated with the release of trimethylsilyl bromide. This subsequently, Scheme 2. Reagents and conditions: (a) chloroacetyl chloride, K 2 CO 3 , DCE, 0\u00b0C, 2 h; (b) 4a-i, K 2 CO 3 , DMF, 80\u00b0C ? rt, 24 h (for 7a-i and 7k-m) or 4j, NaH, DMF, rt, 24 h (for 7j). and efficiently, cleaves dialkyl ethers at elevated temperatures. 20 As a result, in order to obtain 1-[4-(4-bromobenzyloxy)butyl]uracil (16) , it was necessary to alkylate uracil with tosylate 15, which was obtained via a Williamson ether synthesis between 1,4-butanediol and 4 0 -bromobenzyl bromide 18 14 followed by condensation with 4-toluenesulfonyl chloride in the presence of pyridine (Scheme 5).\n\nIn addition, an analog featuring two oxygen atoms in the spacer chain was pursued as shown in Scheme 6. Chloromethyl ether 18 was obtained via the classical Henry method. 21 Condensation with equimolar amount of 2,4-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)pyrimidine led to 1-([2-(4-bromobenzyl)ethoxy]methyl)uracil (19) in 67% yield. Being more reactive than bromides 3a-i and 11, the reaction proceeds under rather mild conditions in DCE at ambient temperature. 22 Next, the flexible spacer was replaced with a rigid 4-(4-bromophenoxy)benzyl moiety, which was introduced at the N 1 of uracil employing previously reported procedures. 23 As outlined in Scheme 7 2,4-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)pyrimidine and 4-(4-bromophenoxy)benzyl bromide (21) were reacted in DCE at reflux for 20 h to give 23. Finally, to investigate the potential role of an amide nitrogen, methylation of 7b with methyl iodide/NaH in DMF successfully produced compound 24 (92% yield, Scheme 8).\n\nThe antiviral activity of the target compounds was evaluated in vitro against different human herpesviruses [i.e., HCMV The results for HCMV and VZV are summarized, respectively, in Tables 1 and 2. The results reveal that the majority of the target compounds share marked inhibitory properties. In examining the results for HCMV, the SAR studies revealed that the nature of the R 1 substituent significantly influences the antiviral activity: 7a\n\nSince compound 7b showed a selectivity (ratio CC 50 /EC 50 ) of about 9 for both HCMV strains and lower toxicity (alteration of cell morphology) than compound 7d, it was considered as the basis for further modifications.\n\nNotably, the nature of the spacer between the uracil and the left aromatic 'wing' significantly influences the anti-HCMV activity of the compounds. For example, elongation of the spacer from 3 to 8 methylene groups progressively lowers EC 50 values, as demonstrated by 7f (n = 3) < 7g (n = 4) < 7b (n = 5) < 7h (n = 6) < 7i (n = 8). Specifically, introduction of five methylene groups to 7f to give 7i increases the activity 43-73 fold, however a concomitant increase in cytotoxicity was also observed.\n\nReplacement of the oxygen atom for a methylene (compound 13) resulted in a loss of activity, which points to the potential role of an ether functionality in the spacer region. A shift in position of the oxygen on the aromatic moiety did not markedly affect activity (1.2 to 2-fold change of 17 as compared to 7b), while introduction of an additional oxygen (compound 20) renders the compound completely inactive. Use of a rigid spacer (compound 23) also proved unfavorable. Overall, incorporation of an alkoxyphenyl side chain proved to be optimal.\n\nInterestingly, the one modification made to the uracil moiety proved deleterious. Substitution of the H 5 of the uracil with iodine rendered 7j completely inactive.\n\nNext, the SAR studies involving modifications to the right 'wing' revealed that the presence of a second benzene core in the acetamide side chain is mandatory for inhibitory properties (compound 7m). Investigation of the role of the linker between the aromatic residues shows that oxygen provides the optimal activity profile. The corresponding methylene analog retains a similar level of activity, but is more cytotoxic (7k), while use of a carbonyl (9) or OCH 2 (7l) group renders the compound significantly less active. N-methylation of the parent 7b has no significant influence on the potency as compound 24 shows.\n\nSimilar activity trends were observed for the anti-VZV properties of the target compounds. The 4-bromo-substituted compound 7b blocks VZV replication at 1.14 lM (OKA strain), which is comparable with acyclovir. At the same time, thymidine kinase deficient strain 07-1 was also susceptible to 7b. Since thymidine kinase is required for the activation of nucleoside analogs (e.g., acyclovir and brivudin), it is likely these compounds are acting as nonnucleoside inhibitors. 24 Other substituents at R 1 were found inactive (7a, 7c-e). As was noted for the HCMV inhibition, elongation of the spacer has a pronounced positive impact on the anti-VZV properties. Compound 7i featuring 8 methylene units proved the most active, with EC 50 's of P 0.12 lM and P 0.16 lM for the OKA and 07-1 strains, respectively. Again however, an increase in activity was accompanied by higher cytotoxicity for both 7h and 7i. Other spacer modifications, including oxygen (13), a position shift (17) , and introduction of additional oxygen (20) , or a benzene moiety (23) all resulted in a loss of activity. Thus, the nature of the spacer once again plays a crucial role in the antiviral properties.\n\nIn terms of substituents, introduction of a substituent at C5 of uracil renders compound 7j completely inactive. Substitution of the oxygen linker between aromatic residues on the acetamide side chain (right wing) led to more the cytotoxic methylene derivative 7k and the less potent 7l (X = OCH 2 ) and 9 (X = CO). In addition, N-methyl derivative 24 and compound 7m, lacking the phenoxy core, indicated that the N-(4-phenoxy-phenyl)acetamide side chain is likely a key element required for antiviral properties of the scaffold.\n\nInterestingly, the compounds were inactive against HSV-1 and HSV-2. This is somewhat surprising since most anti-herpes drugs targeting viral DNA polymerase share a broad spectrum activity against the various herpesviruses. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] The mechanism of action for compounds 7a-m, 9, 13, 17, 20, 23, and 24 however, remains unclear, thus further investigation is warranted. \n\nHerein we have described the synthesis, preliminary biological evaluation and SAR studies for a series of novel uracil derivatives as potential dual HCMV-VZV agents. The majority of the synthesized compounds exhibited potent antiviral activity in cell cultures.\n\nExperimental data undoubtedly shows that x-(4-bromophenoxy) alkyl substituent at N 1 and N-(4-phenoxy-phenyl)acetamide side chain at N 3 of uracil are the key elements responsible for both anti-HCMV and anti-VZV activity. The mode of action for the reported series is not yet fully elucidated and will be published elsewhere once it has been studied further. In the meantime, the most active compounds in the series 7b, 7h and 7i represent an excellent starting point for further optimization.\n\nAll reagents were obtained at the highest grade available from Sigma and Acros Organics, and were used without further purification unless otherwise noted. Anhydrous DMF and isopropyl alcohol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Anhydrous acetone, DCE, and EtOAc were obtained by distillation over P 2 O 5 .

High-resolution mass spectra were measured on Bruker micrOTOF II instruments using electrospray ionization (HRESIMS). The measurements were run in positive ion mode (interface capillary voltage \u00c04500 V) in a mass range from m/z 50 to m/z 3000 Da; external or internal calibration was performed with ESI Tuning MixTM (Agilent Technologies). A syringe injection was used for solutions in MeCN (flow rate = 3 lL/min).

Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or 10 or 100 plaque forming units (PFU) (for VZV and HCMV) in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds.

HEL cells were seeded at a rate of 5 \u00c2 10 3 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates and allowed to adhere and proliferate for 24 h. Then, medium containing different concentrations of the test compounds was added. After 3 days of further incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cell number was determined with a Coulter counter. The cytostatic concentration was calculated as the CC 50 , or the compound concentration required reducing cell proliferation by 50% relative to the number of cells in the untreated controls. CC 50 values were estimated from graphic plots of the number of cells (percentage of control) as a function of the concentration of the test compounds. Alternatively, cytotoxicity of the test compounds was expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) or the compound concentration that caused a microscopically detectable alteration of cell morphology. Selectivity indexes were calculated as the ratio CC 50 to EC 50 ."}
