{"title": "Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus infection in solid organ transplant recipients: impact of viral and non-viral co-infection and The Novel influenza A(H1N1) Study Group of the Spanish Network for Research in Infectious Diseases (REIPI", "body": "In 2009, a new pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus was detected [1, 2] and propagated throughout the world [3] . Although severe pandemic influenza A(H1N1) has been detected in younger patients compared with seasonal influenza, 20% of cases occurred in immunosuppressed patients [4, 5] . In this setting, solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) were included among the risk groups to receive the pandemic vaccine [6, 7] , given the related direct and indirect morbidity of seasonal influenza in this population [8] .\n\nRecently, a retrospective study has described the demographic and clinical characteristics and prognostic factors of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death in 237 adults and children with influenza A and organ transplantation [9] . Other authors, in small series, have observed a longer duration of symptoms, higher frequency of pneumonia and higher mortality rate than in the general population [10, 11] .\n\nInfluenza viral infection is known to predispose to subsequent lung bacterial superinfection [12] . The initial descriptions of severe cases of 2009 pandemic influenza showed evidences of primary viral pneumonia with poor relevance of bacterial co-infection [13] [14] [15] . However, in later studies using PCR and immunochemistry methods, bacterial co-infection was found in 28-55% of fatal cases [16, 17] . Some of the previous studies in SOTR [9, 11] describe the viral or bacterial co-infections, but their impact on the prognosis and clinical care of the influenza was not analyzed.\n\nThe aim of this study was to prospectively assess the clinical characteristics and outcome of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) infection in SOTR, and the risk factors for coinfection by other pathogens.\n\nThis prospective observational study was conducted at nine teaching hospitals belonging to the Spanish Network for Research in Infectious Diseases (REIPI). All SOTR older than 16 years, diagnosed with influenza A(H1N1), and hospitalized at the participating centres from June 2009 to January 2010, were included. A confirmed case was defined in the presence of influenza-like illness with laboratory-confirmed 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus infection. The study was approved by the coordinator local ethics committee and informed consents were obtained from all subjects.\n\nIn cases of respiratory symptoms, SOTR were advised to seek care at the hospital. Thereafter, an investigator evaluated and followed them until cure or death in the case of influenza diagnosis, and clinical data were recorded in a standardized protocol. Data were collected on demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, body mass index (BMI), type of transplant and immunosuppressive therapy, previous vaccination, clinical signs and symptoms, biochemical analysis, chest X-ray findings, antiviral and antibacterial therapy, concomitant and/or secondary infection, and outcomes, including mortality.\n\nPandemic influenza A(H1N1) was confirmed with RT-PCR (Inf A/H1N1 Detection, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), in naspopharyngeal smears or aspirates.\n\nBlood cultures, standard studies for bacterial and fungi of respiratory samples (sputum, bronchial aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage, protected specimen brush and transbronchial biopsy), and urinary antigen tests for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 were performed. Sputum samples were processed if they contained >25 polymorphonuclears and <10 epithelial cells per high-power field. Viral co-infection was investigated in nasopharyngeal samples using a PCR multiplex RV 12 ACE detection seeplex kit (Seegene Inc., Seul, Corea) including metapneumovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus 229E/NL63 and OC43/HKU1, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, rhinovirus A/B, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) A/B, and influenza virus A/B.\n\nObesity was defined as a BMI \u202130. Hospital-acquired influenza was considered when symptoms began more than 7 days after admission. Pneumonia was defined by the presence of clinical symptoms (fever, dyspnoea, cough and/or expectoration) and a new pulmonary infiltrate in the chest X-ray for which other non-infectious causes were excluded. Severity of pneumonia was assessed by the PSI and CURB-65 scores [18, 19] . Non-viral co-infection was considered if bacteria or fungi were isolated from blood or respiratory samples, or with positive urinary antigen detection tests of S. pneumoniae or L. pneumophila. Severe infections were defined as cases that were admitted to ICU, developed graft rejection or died.\n\nA descriptive analysis was performed. Continuous variables are expressed as median and range. All proportions were calculated as percentages of the patients with available data. The chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used for categorical variables and the Student-t, Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests for continuous variables, when appropriate. The multivariate logistic regression analysis of factors potentially associated with non-viral co-infection included significant variables in the univariate analyses and clinically relevant variables. Statistical significance was established at p <0.05 (twotailed). The SPSS software (version 15.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used.\n\nFifty-one SOTR, with a median age of 48 years (16-73) and including 28 (54.9%) men were diagnosed with influenza A (H1N1). The types of transplant were 24 kidney, 11 liver, eight lung, five heart, two combined pancreas-kidney and one combined liver-kidney. Most patients received triple therapy with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. One patient had an allograft rejection treated with a corticosteroid bolus in the month prior to influenza. Influenza occurred at 3.7 years after transplantation (1 day to 21.5 years) and in 40 cases (78.4%) occurred beyond the first year (Fig. 1 ). In three patients (5.9%), symptoms started 1-5 days after the transplant, without identification of the source of influenza infection; all had pneumonia, one died and another lost the graft because of acute rejection. Four cases (7.8%) were hospital acquired.\n\nCo-morbidities, vaccination history and previous use of antibiotics are detailed in Table 1 . Only one patient had received pandemic influenza A(H1N1) vaccine, having normal gammaglobulin levels and no prior rejection episodes.\n\nThe most common symptoms were fever (94.1%) and cough (80.4%). The median delay between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis was 2 days (1-15). Pneumonia occurred in 15 patients (29.4%). Severity of pneumonia was assessed at admission with a median PSI of 72 (20-147) and median CURB-65 score of 1 (0-4). Three and two patients had septic shock (5.9%) and cardiac failure (3.9%), respectively. The main clinical manifestations and radiological and analytical findings are detailed in Table 2 .\n\nAt the diagnosis, the only laboratory findings that differed from previous basal values were the lymphocyte and platelet counts (1504 vs. 750/lL (p <0.001) and 193 800 vs. 169 000/ lL (p 0.004), respectively). \n\nThe median duration of fever and cough were 2 days (0-10) and 3 days (0-18), respectively. The median length of hospital stay was 4 days (2-71). In 10 patients influenza infection was severe (19.6%) ( Table 3) . Seven patients required admission to ICU (13.7%) for a median of 7 days.\n\nFour patients died (7.8%). Two of them died 4 and 7 days after influenza diagnosis, with septic shock and S. aureus bacteraemic pneumonia and S. viridans empyema, respectively. A kidney recipient patient died from pulmonary aspergillosis 31 days after influenza. The fourth patient, a kidney recipient, had pneumococcal bacteraemic pneumonia 8 days after influenza diagnosis and Escherichia coli pneumonia 40 days after influenza.\n\nThree patients had allograft rejection in the month following the influenza diagnosis: a pancreas recipient and a kidney recipient transplanted 4 and 2 months ago, respectively, who responded to a corticosteroid bolus, and a 7-day liver recipient who lost the graft. Immunosuppressants were not reduced in any of these patients after influenza diagnosis. Factors related to severe influenza are detailed in Table 4 . No other predictors were observed in terms of underlying diseases, previous rejection, immunosuppressive therapy (type of calcineurin inhibitor, steroids and induction therapy), types of organ, and clinical manifestations.\n\nPatients with non-viral co-infection had a longer hospital stay (26.2 \u00b1 20.7 vs. 5.5 \u00b1 10.2, p 0.001), and higher rate of severe disease (85.7% vs. 2.3%, RR 9.4, 95% CI 3.5-25.2, p <0.001) and mortality (42.8% vs. 2.3%, RR 18.1, 95% CI 2.3-156.7, p 0.006). The presence of viral co-infection had no influence on the outcomes.\n\nThe present study shows that one-third of SOTR with pandemic influenza had pneumonia, and that mortality is higher than in the general population [20] . Influenza infection is more severe in patients with recent transplants and in those with delayed onset of antiviral therapy, among other factors. Besides this, influenza may be associated with acute allograft rejection. Co-infections were common in SOTR, and nonviral co-infections were associated with a worse outcome. Diabetes mellitus and septic shock were associated with non-viral co-infections.\n\nThe emergence of the pandemic influenza A virus raised important questions regarding its impact on the transplant population, with an expected high associated morbidity and mortality, as confirmed by this and other studies [9] [10] [11] .\n\nSeasonal influenza can occur at any time after the transplant. Vilchez et al. [8] observed a median time since transplantation of 34.5-38.6 months, with the earliest cases occurring 1.5-2 months after the transplant, in 30 SOTR with seasonal influenza. In the case of influenza A(H1N1), our data and other studies show that it may occur at any time after the transplant, with a median time of 27-44 months [9] [10] [11] . Moreover, the present prospective study shows that some cases occurred in the first week after transplant, and it was associated with a poor prognosis; thus, two of three patients lost the graft and died, respectively. Some studies suggested that seasonal influenza severity and mortality increase among transplant recipients in the early post-transplant period [21] . Other studies on pandemic influenza in SORT have not reported data regarding this aspect [9] [10] [11] . In the present study, it was observed that time since transplantation shorter than 3 months was associated with severity.\n\nHospital-acquired seasonal influenza in SOTR has been documented [22] . Within the recent pandemic, hospitalacquired cases of influenza were reported in immunocom-promised patients [23] , and isolated cases were described in SOTR [24, 25] . In the same way, we found that 8% of the pandemic influenza cases were hospital-acquired. Hospitalacquired influenza infection in SOTR, even in the early postoperative period, and the adverse outcomes in cases occurring within the first 3 months after the transplant, prompt some considerations. First, early influenza diagnosis and treatment should be considered in the presence of influenzalike symptoms, especially in cases of pneumonia, in pandemic or seasonal influenza periods, even in the immediate posttransplant period. Secondly, these patients should be considered a high-risk population, and therefore measures to avoid in-hospital transmission should be rigorous, with implementation of infection control measures, such as isolation of infected patients, and avoidance of contact with symptomatic caregivers. In this sense, it is necessary to increase the rate of vaccination among SOTR and close contacts to confer indirect protection for those who are non-responders to vaccine.\n\nIn the present study, we found that symptoms and signs were similar to those described in the general population [26] . Moreover, SOTR with pandemic influenza showed frequent haematological and biochemical abnormalities. Some of them, such as renal failure, mild hepatolysis and anaemia, were present before influenza infection and might possibly be associated with the transplant and concomitant immunosuppressive drugs. However, others, such as lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia, significantly worsen after influenza.\n\nTransplant recipients have more seasonal influenza-related complications than the general population, including primary viral and secondary bacterial pneumonias [8, 27] . The proportion of pneumonia in our cohort was in the reported range (22-49%) in SOTR [9] [10] [11] . With respect to the severity of pneumonia at admission, three of the four cases who died had a PSI risk class of IV or V; accordingly, the CURB-65 score of these patients was 2-4. With the limitations of the reduced number of patients, these data suggest the usefulness of these severity scores for pneumonia in pandemic influenza.\n\nIn the general population, delayed hospital admission and antiviral therapy have been associated with an unfavourable outcome [28] [29] [30] . In the present study, time to antiviral therapy was also associated with severe influenza, being the only modifiable prognostic factor. These data agree with those from a retrospective study showing that delayed antiviral therapy is associated with intensive care unit admission and mortality [9] . It must be noted that most of the patients included received antiviral therapy within 48 h after the onset of symptoms, many of them before virological confirmation, which might have contributed to an improvement in the outcome.\n\nBacterial pneumonia is a known complication of influenza. In the present study, patients with non-viral co-infection, in contrast to those with viral co-infection, experienced a worse outcome despite early antibacterial therapy. Risk factors for non-viral co-infection in patients with pandemic influenza A have not been previously described. In this study, two associated factors at influenza diagnosis have been identified: diabetes mellitus and septic shock. On the other hand, non-viral co-infections were not diagnosed in mild cases without pneumonia. These findings may suggest that nonsevere cases could be managed without antibacterial therapy, reducing the number of patients exposed to antibiotics, in our case two-thirds of the patients.\n\nOur data are subject to several limitations. First, as in other studies carried out in the general population, the data are from hospitalized patients with pandemic influenza A. However, they offer information regarding this illness in transplant patients with severe disease needing hospital admission. Second, as susceptibility to oseltamivir was not performed, we could not conclude whether fatal cases were related to oseltamivir resistance. Third, the possibility of graft rejection was only histologically evaluated if it was clinically evident, which could lead to misdiagnoses of mild allograft rejections.\n\nIn summary, our findings indicate that pandemic influenza A can not only cause significant direct morbidity and mortality in SOTR, especially in the early post-transplant period, but also indirect effects with possibly devastating consequences for graft function. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of non-viral co-infection in these patients, mainly in diabetic patients and severe cases. An effort should be made to increase vaccination among SOTR and caregivers."}
