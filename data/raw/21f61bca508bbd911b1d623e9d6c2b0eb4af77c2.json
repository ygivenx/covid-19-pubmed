{"title": "A Comparison of Two Methods for Retrieving ICD-9-CM data: The Effect of Using an Ontology-based Method for Handling Terminology Changes", "body": "Most existing controlled terminologies can be characterized as collections of terms that are arranged in a simple list or organized in a hierarchy. These terminologies are useful for standardizing terms and encoding data and are used in many existing information systems. Therefore, large amounts of data have been recorded using these terminologies. Moreover, these terminologies evolve over time in order to suit the needs of users. As has been described before, there are a number of types of changes that occur in terminologies that can have an effect on the reusability of data that are encoded with these terminologies [1] . For example, when a major name change occurs, the term associated with a code changes so much that the meaning is essentially different, even as the code remains the same. Other types of changes include simple addition, refinement, deletion due to obsolescence, deletion due to redundancy, minor name change, precoordination, disambiguation, code change, and code reuse. In this article we focus on code change, which occurs when the code for a term changes but the term's meaning remains exactly the same. For example, in the 2005 version of ICD-9-CM, the code for \"Meconium aspiration syndrome\" is 770.1, but in the 2006 version, its code has been changed to 770.10. Recall can be decreased when searching for ICD-9-CMencoded data because when the code for a term changes, a retrieval method that does not properly manage the code change may miss cases that are encoded with the new code for the term.\n\nWe have developed the ConceptTermRelation method, which is based on a formal representation that captures information about the relationship between concepts and terms. This representation is meant to be used in conjunction with a domain ontology constructed according to formal ontological principles. While the domain ontology serves as a representation of the things in a domain, the ConceptTermRelation methodology is used to represent associations between terms and concepts.\n\nThe concept-term relationship itself is represented as a reified ConceptTermRelation concept, which has as its attributes:\n\n(1) the hasCode attribute that is filled by the terminology's code for the concept.\n\n(2) the hasTerm attribute that is filled by the terminology's term for the concept.\n\n(3) the hasStartDatetime attribute that is filled by the date when the particular code and term begin to be used or associated with each other in the terminology. (4) the hasEndDatetime attribute that is filled by the date when the particular code and term case cease to be used or associated with each other in the terminology.\n\nSpecific relationships between concepts and terms are represented by instantiating the ConceptTermRelation concept as particular ConceptTermRelation instances. Figure 1 shows how we defined the ConceptTermRelation concept in OWL (Web Ontology Language) [2] , and Figure 2 illustrates the use of the ConceptTermRelation methodology to represent and handle inferences about code changes.\n\nWe have implemented our methodology in a terminology maintenance tool as an extension to the Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 ontology editor. We used the tool to interface a domain ontology derived from SNOMED CT (2005) and parts of ICD-9-CM (1997 version). We also used the tool to handle successive changes to ICD-9-CM (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) . Then, as part of our evaluation of the methodology, we compared two information retrieval methods based on their performance on retrieving ICD-9-CM-encoded data after the occurrence of a code change. Method 1 (\"Default\") was based on a static view of the ICD-9-CM terminology (i.e. without regard for changes in concepts, terms, and codes); this is the approach typically used in retrospective studies [3] [4] [5] . Method 2 (\"Informed\") was based on an approach for managing ICD-9-CM that took into account the effects of terminological changes using an ontological view. In the case of a code change, Method 2 utilizes the information about the code change, so that searches against an ICD-9-CM-encoded database will retrieve cases with the new code as well as the old code. Since Method 1 does not utilize this information, only cases encoded with the old code will be retrieved.\n\nICD-9-CM-encoded clinical data were obtained from the Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) clinical data repository (January 1, 1997 -May 1, 2006). All data were formatted and deidentified using Perl scripts and stored on a secure database running We analyzed all the changes that occurred in ICD-9-CM and categorized them according to the terminology change types originally described by Cimino [1] . Terminology changes that occurred across the 1997-2006 versions of the ICD-9-CM were listed and sorted into bins of change types.\n\nWe obtained a random sample of ten code changes from the population of terminology changes in the bin for code changes. For each code change, we generated a corpus of cases using a combination of keyword-and pattern matching-based searches to screen for cases that had the discharge diagnosis from the CUMC clinical data repository. A case was defined as a unique hospital inpatient course that occurred over a period of time beginning at the admission date and ending at the discharge date. Therefore, the same patient could be associated with more than one case. Discharge dates had to be within the time period encompassing the consecutive 24 months (i.e., before October) preceding the code change, and the consecutive 15 months afterward. The date range was based on results of test runs of the case-retrieval program we used to screen for cases.\n\nCases were allocated equally among five judges. For each of the cases retrieved by the screening process, the judges reviewed the diagnosis section (also called the \"impression\" or \"assessment\" section) of the discharge summary associated with each case and made a judgment that served as the reference standard for that case. Judges were asked to determine whether any one of the ten diagnoses was made by the primary physician in each case: After reading the diagnosis section of the discharge summary, the judges determined whether the diagnosis was documented by the primary physician in the case. Possible responses included \"Yes\", \"Maybe\", \"Cannot tell\", and \"No\". A positive case was defined as a case where the diagnosis was given by the primary physician. A negative case was defined as a case where the diagnosis was not given by the primary physician. The raters' responses were dichotomized into the two categories in three different ways. This was done because it was found that there was some variation in how judges interpreted the \"maybe\" and \"cannot tell\" categories. In the first dichotomization, \"Yes\" responses were binned into the positive case category, and \"Maybe\", \"Cannot tell\", and \"No\" responses were binned into the negative cases category. In the second dichotomization, \"Yes\" and \"Maybe\" responses were binned into the positive case category, and \"Cannot tell\" and \"No\" responses were binned into the negative case category. Finally, in the third dichotomization, \"Yes\", \"Maybe\", and \"Cannot tell\" responses were binned into the positive case category, and only \"No\" responses were binned into the negative case category.\n\nFor each code change, we carried out parallel SQL queries using Methods 1 and 2 against the corpus of cases generated for recall measurement. Recall was computed as the proportion of all cases in the corpus that were classified as a positive case by the human experts and also retrieved by the method, based on the actual codes in the patient records. The recall performance of Methods 1 and 2 on each code change were compared using the McNemar Test, which is appropriate when the data consist of paired observations of nominal data [6] . Finally, in order to estimate the reliability of the measurement process, the judges were asked to give their responses to each case in a separate set of 96 cases. There were five (5) judges and three (3) categories (\"Yes\",\"Cannot tell OR Maybe yes\", and \"No\"). Inter-rater reliability was measured using an intraclass correlation coefficient (two-way mixed, single measures, absolute agreement -corresponding to Shrout and Fleiss's ICC(3,1) [7] ) using the SPSS statistical software program [8] . Table 1 shows the ten selected code changes. A total of 675 cases were retrieved by the screening process and were presented to the judges. Two of the judges had finished 3 years of specialty training in Internal Medicine, 1 judge had finished 1 year of specialty training in Internal Medicine, and 1 judge had finished medical school. Table 2 shows the results of measuring the recall performance of Methods 1 and 2 on the code changes. The results show that Method 2 performed significantly better (p<0.05) than Method 1 for 2 of the ICD-9-CM terms whose codes had changed (Code changes 3 and 9), regardless of how judges' responses were dichotomized in the reference standard. For a third code change (Code change 8), Method 2 performed better than Method 1 using dichotomization 3. Finally, when all the cases were combined in an \"overall\" category, Method 2 also performed statistically significantly better (p < 0.05) than Method 1. The calculated interclass correlation coefficient was sufficiently large at 0.599 (95% CI 0.503, 0.689). The results of the inter-rater reliability study show that reliability was sufficient for the judges' responses to be used as a reference standard.\n\nOur method builds upon previous work on using a formal analytical approach to detecting and managing terminology changes. Furthermore, we adopt a formal representation of terminology changes that is compatible with the widely-adopted Web Ontology Language (OWL) representation for ontologies. An ontology-based approach is that it allows us to handle changes in the terminology in a way that propagates these changes down a class hierarchy correctly (inheritance). Furthermore, the method also handles other types of terminology changes that are not solved by simply querying for the class. For example, in major name changes, the meaning of the term/code changes but the code remains the same. Our method allows for the representation and handling of these kinds of changes.\n\nOne notable result is that the recall performance of either method is low, and this finding may be explained by the fact that the automated retrieval of cases (based on incomplete coding of cases by human coders) is measured against the responses of human expert judges who were asked about specific diagnoses. It is not hard to understand why Method 2's recall performance can be significantly better for terms whose codes have changed. Even though there is bound to be some lag between the official start date of a code change in ICD-9-CM and full compliance with that change, over time, human coders will become better at using the new (and correct) code for the diagnosis. A method that did not take into account code changes would miss more cases with the correct diagnosis, since the method would not know that cases with the new code should be retrieved. On the other hand, a method that took into account the new code would retrieve cases with the old code (prior to the date when the change is enforced) as well as cases with the new code (subsequent to the date when the change is enforced).\n\nPrecision was not measured in this study, because cases were retrieved with either method based on coding by the hospital coders with the relevant codes, even if the judges did not do so based on the limited abstracts they reviewed. However, Method 2 has the potential to improve precision, because it takes code reuse into account.\n\nCode reuse is a type of terminology change that occurs in ICD-9-CM when the name associated with a code is changed in such a way as to change its meaning (the converse of a code change). Although none of the codes were affected by code reuse, this type of change does occur in ICD-9-CM. If one of the codes had been reused during the study period, Method 1 would incorrectly retrieve cases coded with that code subsequent to its change in meaning, thereby increasing the number of false positive cases and reducing precision.\n\nWhile ICD-9-CM is by no means representative of all terminologies, the pervasiveness of its use in health care, as well as the fact that many of the difficulties of handling \"real world\" terminologies also plague ICD-9-CM, made it a good candidate for this study on the effects of properly handling terminology changes on reuse of healthcare data. ICD-9-CM-encoded data is ubiquitous, as it is currently a part of reimbursement and reporting requirements, therefore, the results of this study are applicable to a broad range of areas such as quality assurance and clinical research. One limitation of the study is that ICD did not change as drastically as it has in past years, and so we were limited to studying code changes, and the measured difference in performance was relatively small. \n\nWhen data are reused, the effects of terminology changes need to be taken into account. Our study shows that an ontology-based ICD-9-CM data retrieval method that does so performs better on recall than one that does not in the retrieval of data for terms whose codes had changed but which retained their original meaning."}
