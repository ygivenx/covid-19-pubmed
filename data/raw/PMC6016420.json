{"title": "Infectious MERS-CoV Isolated From a Mildly Ill Patient, Saudi Arabia", "body": "A 27-year-old expatriate female was tested for MERS-CoV on October 10, 2015, following diagnosis of her roommate with MERS the previous day. She was found to be positive by MERS-CoV-specific real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and was subsequently admitted to a MERS referral hospital in Riyadh on October 10 for isolation and monitoring. Based on public health investigation at that time, she reported the onset of mild upper respiratory symptoms on September 30, 2015, 10 days before detection and hospitalization (Figure 1); the following findings are presented according to this date, as days post\u2013illness onset.\n\nAccording to a retrospective review of her medical chart, the patient had rhinorrhea at the time of admission and denied cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, or fever (Figure 1A). She reported no underlying medical conditions. White blood cell counts with differential and blood chemistry analyses were within normal limits throughout hospitalization (Supplementary Table 1). A chest x-ray was obtained 13 days after illness onset (on October 13) and was interpreted as unremarkable. She received oseltamivir, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin empirically beginning at admission. Following her hospital admission, no respiratory symptoms were reported until 22 days after illness onset (on October 22), when the patient developed a mild cough, which was noted for 6 days (Figure 1A); she remained on room air throughout. No hypoxia was identified during hospitalization, and her oral temperature peaked at 37.6\u00b0C. Just before discharge, she reported rhinorrhea and was started on oseltamivir following a new diagnosis of influenza. She was discharged 40 days after illness onset (on November 9).\n\nTo assess MERS-CoV status, we reviewed hospital records for serial diagnostic testing of respiratory specimens, performed by MoH using rRT-PCR assays targeting MERS-CoV upE and ORF1a genes [12]. The same diagnostic specimens were also routinely tested for influenza A virus (H1N1), and these results were reviewed if available.\n\nBased on hospital records, 16 NP swabs were collected for MERS-CoV diagnostic testing (Figure 1). Twelve NP swabs collected during 10\u201332 days after illness onset (between October 10 and November 1) were confirmed positive (Figure 1A). Cycle threshold (Ct) values of MERS-CoV upE rRT-PCR were available for 11 of the 12 positive specimens and ranged from 25 to 37 (Figure 1B). On day 10 after onset, the upE Ct value was 37, indicating a low viral load; by day 14, the Ct value was much lower, at 25, indicating a notable rise in viral load. An NP swab collected 36 days after illness onset was probable for MERS-CoV, meaning that 1 target was detected but the other was not; target-specific results were not available. The final 2 NP swabs collected 37 and 39 days after illness onset tested negative. The swab collected on day 37 tested positive for influenza A virus (H1N1) by rRT-PCR. Among the 14 NP swabs collected during days 10\u201337, 12 tested negative for H1N1, and results for the remaining 2 were not available (Figure 1A).\n\nFor additional molecular and serologic analysis at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2 (of each) NP, whole blood, sera, stool, and urine specimens were collected on days 13 and 15 after illness onset (on October 13 and 15); NP swabs were collected in 2 mL of viral transport medium. All specimens were frozen and shipped on dry ice. At the CDC, stool suspensions were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (10% weight/volume). RNA was extracted from 200-\u00b5L sample aliquots on a NucliSens EasyMAG (BioMerieux), recovering 100 \u00b5L of total nucleic acid. Testing was performed by MERS-CoV upE and N2 and/or N3 rRT-PCR assays [13]. All specimen extracts were tested neat; stool extracts were also diluted 1:5 in nuclease-free water to remove potential stool inhibitors. Genome sequencing was attempted on positive specimens with Ct values \u226436, as described previously [14]. Nucleotide sequences were aligned using Clustal X, version 1.83, implemented in BioEdit, version 7.2.5. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using MrBayes 3.2.6 under a GTR model of nucleotide substitution with 4 categories of \u03b3-distributed rate heterogeneity and a proportion of invariant sites (GTR + 4 + I).\n\nMERS-CoV RNA was detected in the 2 NP swabs, and 1 stool specimen (at 1:5 dilution) was collected 15 days after illness onset. Estimated viral loads, based on the upE assay, were 4.8 \u00d7 106 and 9.6 \u00d7 105 genome copies/mL in the NP specimens collected on days 13 and 15, respectively, and 1.0 \u00d7 104 genome copies/gm of stool from day 15. Whole-genome sequences were obtained from the 2 sequential NP swabs and were 100% identical (accession numbers: MG520075-MG520076). They showed 99.9% similarity and closest phylogenetic clustering with sequences from 4 severely ill MERS patients who were linked to a hospital outbreak in Riyadh in August 2015 (accession numbers: KU851860-851862 and KU851864) [15].\n\nThe 2 MERS-CoV RNA-positive NP specimens submitted to the CDC (collected on days 13 and 15) were serially diluted 10-fold in DMEM in a 96-well plate, and subsequently used to inoculate Vero cell suspensions. The cells were observed daily between days 3 and 7 postinoculation; cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed under inverted scope 3 days postinoculation. Any wells that exhibited CPE were harvested and passaged in a 24-well plate. RNA was extracted from 50 \u03bcL of the potential virus lysate. Both lysates were confirmed positive for MERS-CoV by N2 rRT-PCR assay; Ct values were 12 (day 13) and 15 (day 15). The isolated viruses (accession numbers: MG546330-MG546331) were subsequently sequenced using Fluidigm Access Array PCR and MiSeq amplicon sequencing [16]. Whole-genome sequences of the 2 isolated viruses were identical to their clinical specimens, except the day 13 isolated virus, which had mixed bases at positions 23 364 and 25 861 (nucleotide location based on accession number JX869059.2). The variant alleles of the isolate would predict amino acid changes (N>D in spike [S] protein and V>L in ORF4a) that may reflect adaptation in culture. Virus isolation was not attempted for the MERS-CoV RNA-positive stool specimen because of low virus load.\n\nSera collected at days 13 and 15 after onset were examined for the presence of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies against the nucleocapisd (N) and S proteins, as previously described [17]. Both specimens were below the limit of detection for both N and S enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). No sera were available after day 15.\n\nWe describe isolation of live MERS-CoV from the upper respiratory tract of a mildly ill patient in Saudi Arabia. The ability of a mildly ill MERS patient to shed live virus has not previously been documented and fills an important gap in our understanding of MERS-CoV natural history.\n\nThe patient\u2019s illness began with reports of upper respiratory tract symptoms, or \u201ca common cold.\u201d Rhinorrhea was noted 10 days later, when she was admitted to the hospital for isolation, after which no symptoms were reported for a further 12 days. A mild cough then began 22 days after illness onset and lasted for 6 days. Despite this mild cough, she was noted to be without hypoxia, dyspnea, chest pain, or other signs/symptoms of respiratory illness throughout hospitalization. MERS-CoV RNA was detected in her stool specimen (at day 15) and up to 32 days after illness onset in upper respiratory specimens; low virus load in the stool was coincident with the highest virus loads measured in the upper respiratory tract and may reflect shedding from that compartment. Most notably, live virus was isolated from the NP swabs collected 13 and 15 days after illness onset, when she was reported to be asymptomatic. N and S ELISA antibody responses were not detected by day 15 of illness. We were unable to test subsequent serum specimens.\n\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital for isolation following MERS-CoV detection. Home isolation may be considered for asymptomatic or mildly ill patients who test positive for MERS-CoV [18], but this case patient resided in shared accommodation, and home isolation was not practical. Although the role of mildly ill patients in transmission is not fully understood [19], the ability of these patients to shed infectious MERS-CoV, as demonstrated here, should inform home isolation considerations."}
