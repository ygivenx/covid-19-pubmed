{"title": "Biology and Diseases of Mice", "body": "A. Origin and History most thoroughly characterized mammal on earth (Morse, 1979) .\n\nThe mouse is assigned to the genus Mus, subfamily Murinae, family Muridae, order Rodentia. Anatomical features of the molar teeth and cranial bones help to differentiate it from other murids. The house mouse of North America and Europe, Mus musculus, is the species commonly used for biomedicai re search. It was employed in comparative anatomical studies as early as the seventeenth century, but the acceleration of biolog ical research in the nineteenth century, a renewed interest in Mendelian genetics, and the requirement for a small, economic mammal that was easily housed and bred were instrumental to the development of the \"modern\" laboratory mouse. These studies have grown exponentially during the current century and have made the laboratory mouse, in genetic terms, the\n\nGenetic mapping in mice began in the early 1900s. Extensive linkage maps and an impressive array of inbred strains are now available to expedite sophisticated genetic research. Mice have 40 chromosomes that are differentiated by the size and pattern of transverse bands. The chromosomes are designated in order of decreasing size by arabic numbers. Chromosome rearrange ments serve as markers for assigning known linkage groups to specific chromosomes and for determining locus order with respect to the centromere.\n\nOne of the most thoroughly studied genetic systems of the mouse is the histocompatibility complex. Histocompatibility (//) loci control expression of cell surface molecules that mod ulate major immunological phenomena, such as the recogni tion of foreign tissue. For example, the time, onset, and speed of skin graft rejection are controlled by two groups of// loci. The major group is called H-2 and is located on chromosome 17. These genes cause rapid rejection (10-20 days) of grafts that display foreign H-2 antigens. Minor H loci groups are scattered throughout the genome and are responsible for de layed graft rejection. Genes associated with the H-2 complex also control other immunological functions, such as cell-cell interactions in primary immune responses and the level of re sponse to a given antigen. Immune-mediated responses to in fectious agents such as viruses and complement activity are influenced directly or indirectly by the H-2 complex (Klein, 1975) .\n\nInbred mice are also valuable for research in other fields such as immunology, oncology, microbiology, biochemistry, phar macology, physiology, anatomy, and radiobiology. For exam ple, inbred histocompatible strains are used extensively as do nors of plasma cell tumors to immortalize cell lines (hybridomas) that secrete highly uniform, monospecific immunoglobulin in vitro, theoretically in unlimited quantities. This technology has made the full range of functional mouse anti body molecules available for study. Transplantable murine plasmacytomas also have provided specific components of immunoglobulin biosynthesis, including the immunoglobulin genes, mRNA, and intermediates in the assembly of immu noglobulin genes (Potter, 1983) . (Lyon, 1981; Green, 1981) Laboratory mice are identified by strain or by breeding sys tem. The geneology of major inbred mouse strains is presented in Figs. 1-3. Seven breeding system designations have been developed (Table I) and each requires technical skill and a firm understanding of mammalian genetics. Inbred strains were first developed in 1909 by C. C. Little and offer a high degree of genetic uniformity. They are, for practical purposes, genet ically identical to other mice of the same strain and sex. They are produced by brother-sister matings for at least 20 genera tions. By contrast, random bred mice are genetically hetero geneous, and are often produced by breeding systems that min imize inbreeding. Individual random bred mice may differ in coat color, histocompatibility loci, enzyme polymorphisms, and other characteristics. Random pairing is best planned with the aid of tables of randomized numbers or a randomizing de vice. However, true random breeding may be difficult to achieve in a small research colony by random pairing. In a population of 25 breeding pairs, for example, heterozygosity will decrease at 1% per generation with standard randomiza tion techniques. A random breeding program that is easy to manage is the circular pair mating system, where each pair is mated only once. Conceptually, cages are visualized in a circle and each cage contains one breeding pair in the nth generation. Another ' 'circular\" set of cages serves as the nucleus for the n + 1 generation. Each mated pair from the nth generation con tributes one female and one male for the n + 1 generation. Random breeding is accomplished by assigning the male and female from the nth generation to different cages rather than to the same cage. Other useful random mating systems are the cousin system and another circular system (see Table I ).\n\nRecombinant inbred strains are developed by single-pair ran dom matings of mice from an F 2 generation by crossing two inbred strains. Lines selected for desired characteristics are perpetuated by brother-sister matings for 20 generations to ob tain homozygosity. Recombinant inbred strains may take as long as 7 years to produce. However, they are essential for detecting new genetic linkages and inherited traits.\n\nThere are currently more than 500 separate outbred stocks and inbred strains, some with various sublines. Mutant stocks have also been established and are used as models of human diseases. Therefore, strain or stock designations must be as complete to avoid semantic and genetic confusion. As an ex ample of subline variation, CBA/J carries the gene for retinal degeneration, while CBA/Ca does not.\n\nSpecific nomenclatures have been developed for both inbred and noninbred strains. Strains are designated by a series of letters and/or numbers, a shorthand description of the strain's origin and history. For example, the inbred strain C57BL/6J originated from female 57 at the Cold Spring Harbor Laborato ry (C) and was the black (BL) line from this female. The 6 indicates that it is subline number 6, and the J that it was bred at the Jackson Laboratory. A noninbred stock designated A5 (S) indicates that it was produced by High Quality farms, stock A5 of Swiss (S) stock origin. Specific designations also apply to substrains and to coisogenic, congenic, and segregating in bred strains. The Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomen clature for Mice publishes a periodic listing of strains and stocks and updated rules for nomenclature. Inbred strains are also listed in the biennial Inbred Strains of Mice (Staats, 1977) and every 4 years in Cancer Research (Staats, 1976) . The Mouse News Letter (issued twice yearly by MRC Laboratories in England and The Jackson Laboratory in the United States) lists genetic symbols currently in use and all changes in nomenclature.\n\nHousing and husbandry for mice are often guided by micro biological requirements. A colony can be maintained in a \"conventional\" environment or behind a barrier where the Morse, 1981.) mice are protected from specific microorganisms. Examples of barrier housing include positive pressure isolators and mass air-flow rooms that provide sterile air through high-efficiency particle-arresting (HEPA) filters.\n\nMouse cages vary in design, size, and composition. The popular shoebox cage used for housing and breeding mice is usually made of polycarbonate, polypropylene, or polystyrene plastic (in order of decreasing cost and durability). Stainless steel is considered by some to be the most satisfactory caging material since it is smoother, more durable, and easier to clean than plastic. Mice are sometimes housed in suspended cages with open-mesh bottoms that allow excrement to fall through to a collecting pan. Suspended caging is rarely used for breed ing because neonatal thermor\u00e9gulation is difficult to maintain without nesting material. Cage mesh should be stainless steel rather than galvanized steel, since the former is easier to clean and less susceptible to rust. Cages should keep animals dry and clean, maintain a comfortable ambient temperature, allow freedom of movement and normal postural adjustments, avoid unnecessary physical restraints, provide convenient access to feed and water, and prevent overcrowding.\n\nSolid bottom cages should contain sanitary bedding, such as Morse, 1981.) wood chips or ground corn cob. Criteria for selecting bedding vary with experimental and husbandry needs (Table II) . It is preferable to autoclave bedding prior to use, but if this is not convenient, it should be used only after its origin and microbial content have been evaluated (Table III) . Nutrient requirements for the mouse are influenced by genet ic background, disease status, pregnancy, and environment. The best current estimate of nutritional requirements is shown in Table IV . Nutritional requirements for laboratory mice are also published periodically by the National Research Council. Feed intake and weight gain data are used to estimate the nutri tional needs of a particular stock or strain. Mice consume about 3-5 gm of feed per day after weaning and maintain this intake throughout life. Outbred mice tend to gain weight faster than inbred mice and are heavier at maturity (Figs. 4 and 5) .\n\nDiet is often neglected as a variable in animal-related re search. Diet can influence responses to drugs, chemicals, or other factors and lead to biased research results. Therefore, diet must provide a balance of essential nutrients, and contami nants must be kept to a minimum (see also Chapter 23 by Pakes et ai). Natural product commercial diets for mice are satisfactory for breeding and maintenance. Fresh produce, grains, fishmeal, or other supplements may expose colonies to pathogenic bacteria or harmful chemicals and should be avoided.\n\nMice should have continuous access to potable water even if \n\nKinds of Mice Used in Research\" Definition of breeding system Perpetuation of breeding system Reference 1.

Water is needed for lubrication of dry food and for hydration. Adult mice drink 6 to 7 ml of water per day. Decreased water intake will decrease food consump tion. Water imbalance may occur during disease, since sick mice commonly drink very little water. Because of this, it may be unsuitable to administer medicine by this route.\n\nA. Physiology and Anatomy (Cook, 1983 ; Kaplan et aL y\n\nMice have a relatively large surface area per gram of body weight. This results in dramatic physiologic changes in re sponse to fluctuations in the ambient temperature (\u00c3 \u00c1 ). The mouse responds to cold exposure, for example, by nonshivering thermogenesis. A resting mouse acclimated to cold can generate heat equivalent to about triple the basal metabolic rate, a change that is greater than for any other animal. A mouse must generate about 46 kcal/m 2 /24 hr to maintain body temperature for each 1\u00b0C drop in T A below the thermoneutral zone. Mice cannot tolerate nocturnal cooling as well as larger animals that have a greater heat sink. Therefore, conserving energy in animal quarters at night by lowering thermostats is not prudent management.\n\nBecause of its great ratio of evaporative surface to body mass, the mouse has a greater sensitivity than most mammals to water loss. Its biological half-time for turnover of water (1.1 days) is more rapid than for larger mammals. Water conserva tion is embellished by cooling of expired air in the nasal pas sages and by the highly efficient concentration of urine.\n\nThe conservation of water can preempt thermal stability. If Kraft (1980) . the mouse had to depend on the evaporation of body water to prevent elevations of body temperature, it would go into shock from dehydration. The mouse has no sweat glands, it cannot pant, and its ability to salivate is severely limited. Mice can partially compensate for changes in T A by varying body tem perature (\u00c3 \u00c2 ). For example, the T B of a mouse can increase from 33.8\u00b0 to 37.2\u00b0C when the T A increases from 20\u00b0 to 35\u00b0C. It adapts to moderate but persistent increases in environmental temperature by a persistent increase in body temperature, a persistent decrease in metabolic rate, and increased vascularization of the ears to increase heat loss. Its primary means of cooling in the wild is behavioral-retreat into a burrow. In the confinement of a cage, truck, or plane, mice do not survive well in heat and begin to die at an ambient temperature of 37\u00b0C. Thus, the mouse is not a true endotherm. In fact, the neonatal mouse is ectothermic and does not have well-devel oped temperature control before 20 days of age. The thermoneutral zone for mice varies with strain and with conditioning, but is about 29.6\u00b0-30.5\u00b0C, narrower than that of any other mammal thus far measured. Thermoneutrality should not be equated with comfort or physiological economy. There are repeated studies to show that mice in a T A range of 21\u00b0-25\u00b0C grow faster, have larger litters, and have more via ble pups than those maintained in the thermoneutral zone.\n\nThe respiratory tract has three main portions: the anterior respiratory tract consists of nostrils, nasal cavities, and nasopharynx; the intermediate section consists of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi, all of which have cartilagenous support; and the posterior portion of the respiratory tract consists of the Nutrient Protein (as crude prol Fat* Fiber Carbohydrate Knapka (1983) . ^Linoleic acid: 0.6% is adequate.

The right lung is divided into four lobes: superior, middle, inferior, and postcaval. A mouse at rest uses about 3.5 ml 0 2 /gm/hr, which is about 22 times more 0 2 /gm/hr than is used by an elephant. To ac commodate for this high metabolic rate, the mouse has a high alveolar \u00d1 \u00e8 2 ; a rapid respiratory rate; a short air passage; a moderately high erythrocyte (RBC) concentration; high RBC hemoglobin and carbonic anhydrase concentrations; a high blood 0 2 capacity; a slight shift in the 0 2 -dissociation curve enabling 0 2 to be unloaded in the tissue capillaries at a high \u00d1 \u00e8 2 ; a more pronounced Bohr effect, i.e., the hemoglobin af finity for 0 2 with changes in pH is more pronounced; a high capillary density; and a high blood sugar concentration.\n\nThe kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra form the urinary system (Fig. 6) . The paired kidneys lie against the dor sal body wall of the abdomen on either side of the midline. The right kidney is normally located anterior to the left kidney. Kidneys from males of many inbred strains are consistently heavier than kidneys from females. The glomeruli of mice are small, about 74 m in diameter, or about half the size of glomeruli in rats. There are, however, 4.8 times as many glomeruli in the mouse and the filtering surface per gram of tissue is twice that of the rat.\n\nMice excrete only a drop or two or urine at a time, and it is highly concentrated ( Table V) . The high concentration is made possible by long loops of Henle and by the organization of giant vascular bundles (vasa recta) associated with the loops of Henle in the medulla. The mouse can concentrate urine to 4300 mOsm/liter compared to a maximum permissible concentra tion of 1160 mOsm/liter for a human.\n\nMice normally excrete large amounts of protein in the urine. Taurine is always present in mouse urine, whereas tryptophan is always absent. Creatinine is also excreted in mouse urine, a trait in which mice differ from other mammals. The creatinine/ creatine ratio for fasting mice is about 1 : 1.4. Mice excrete much more allantoin than uric acid. Cook, 1983.) \n\nThe submaxillary salivary gland, a mixed gland in most ani mals, secretes only one type of saliva (seromucoid) in the mouse. The tubular portion of the gastrointestinal tract consists of esophagus, stomach, small intestine, cecum, and colon.\n\nThe esophagus of the mouse is lined by a thick cornified squamous epithelium making gavage a relatively simple pro cedure. The proximal portion of the stomach is also keratinized, whereas the distal part of the stomach is glandular. Gastric secretion continues whether or not food is present.\n\nThe gastrointestinal flora consists of over 100 species of bac teria that begin to colonize the alimentary canal selectively shortly after birth. They form a complex ecosystem that pro vides beneficial effects, such as an increase in resistance to certain intestinal pathogens, production of essential vitamins, and homeostasis of important physiologic functions (Fig. 7) .\n\nThe lymphatic system consists of lymph vessels, thymus, lymph nodes, spleen, solitary peripheral nodes (Fig. 8) , and intestinal Peyer's patches. The typical lymph node is beanshaped and consists of a cortex and a medulla. The cortex is divided into B lymphocyte domains, called primary follicles, and T lymphocyte domains, known as the diffuse cortex. The mouse does not have palatine or pharyngeal tonsils. The spleen lies adjacent to the greater curvature of the stomach. Different strains of mice have varying degrees of accessory splenic tissue. Age, strain, sex and health status can affect the size, shape, and appearance of the spleen.

(1983) . Schaedler and Orcutt, 1983.) Decay of passive immunity progresses with age; for example, the waning of protective maternal antibody in mice between 1 and 2 months of age makes these mice susceptible to enzootic Sendai infection in breeding colonies. pie, may be 50% larger than those of females. Most lympho cytes enter and leave the spleen in the bloodstream. Cellular and humoral components of immunity are distributed to the bloodstream and tissues by efferent lymphatic vessels and lymphatic ducts, which empty into the venous system.\n\nThe thymus is a bilobed lymphoid organ lying in the anterior mediastinum. It reaches maximum size around the time of sex ual maturity and involutes between 35 and 80 days of age. The thymus plays a major role in the maturation and differentiation of T lymphocytes. This function is not complete in newborn mice. Thymectomy is routinely performed in immunological research for experimental manipulation of the immune system. Thymectomy of newborn mice causes a decrease in circulating lymphocytes and marked impairment of certain immune re sponses, particularly cellular immune responses. Thymectomy in adult mice produces no immediate effect, but several months later mice may develop a progressive decline of cir culating lymphocytes and impaired cellular immune responses. The mutant athymic nude mouse offers a powerful experimen tal tool in the study of the thymus in immune regulation. Some transmission of humoral immunity occurs in utero, but the ma jority of antibody is transferred after birth through colostrum.\n\nThe heart consists of four chambers, the thin-walled atria and the thick-walled ventricles (Fig. 9) .\n\nMice conditioned to a recording apparatus have mean sys tolic blood pressures ranging from 84 to 105 mm Hg. An in crease in body temperature does not lead to an increase in blood pressure. Heart rate, cardiac output, and the width of cardiac myofibers are related to the size of the animal. Heart rates from 310 to 840/min have been recorded for mice, and there are wide variations in rates and blood pressure among strains. Normal h\u00e9matologie, blood chemistries, and other physiologic values are listed in Tables VI and VII.\n\nThe skeleton is composed of two parts: the axial skeleton, which consists of the skull, vertebrae, ribs, and sternum, and the appendicular skeleton, which consists of the pectoral and pelvic girdles and the paired limbs. The normal vertebral for mula for the mouse is C7T13L6S4C28, with some variations between strains, especially in the thoracic and lumbar regions. Cook, 1983.) Normal mouse dentition consists of an incisor and three mo lars in each quadrant. These develop and erupt in sequence from front to rear. The third molar is the smallest tooth in both jaws; the upper lower third molar may be missing in wild mice and in some inbred strains. The incisors grow continuously and are worn down during mastication. Fig. 9 . Heart and major vessels. (Modified from Cook, 1983.)

A de tailed study of the neuroanatomy of the C57BL/6J mouse was made by Sidman et al. (1971) .\n\nThe male reproductive organs consist of paired testes, urethra, penis, and associated ducts and glands (Fig. 10) . Female reproductive organs consist of paired ovaries and oviducts, uterus, cervix, vagina, clitoris, and paired clitoral glands (Fig. 6) . The clitoral glands are homologous to the male preputial glands and secrete a sebaceous substance through ducts entering the lateral wall of the clitoral fossa. The female mouse normally has five pairs of mammary glands, three in the cervicothoracic region and two in the inguinoabdominal re gion. Detailed techniques for manipulating gametes and em bryos have been developed (Daniel, 1978) .\n\nThe following section emphasizes general aspects of normal reproduction in the mouse. The reader is referred to compre hensive treatments for additional information (Bronson et al., 1966; Whittingham and Wood, 1983; Austin and Short, 1982) . External influences, such as noise, diet, light, and population density, play an important role in reproduction and directly or indirectly influence the hypothalmic-pituitary axis for hor monal control of ovarian and testicular function. Genotype also dramatically affects the reproductive performance of the mouse.\n\nFollicle-stimulating hormone promotes gametogenesis in both sexes. Luteinizing hormones promote the secretion of es trogen and progresterone in the female and androgen in the male. Prolactin promotes lactation and development of the ov ary during pregnancy. These gonadal hormones also ensure proper maintenance of the reproductive tract and modulate be havior to promote successful mating. The hypophysis is usu ally responsive to hormonal influence by day 6 in the male and by day 12 in the female. Ovarian follicle development begins at 3 weeks of age and matures by 30 days. Rising titers of gonadotropins evoke signs of sexual maturity at about the same age. In the female, estrogen-dependent changes such as cornification of vaginal epithelium at the vaginal opening can occur as early as 24 to 28 days. Puberty is slightly later in the male (up to 2 weeks). Sexual maturation varies among strains and stocks of mice and is subject to seasonal and environmental influences. Mating behavior and the ability to conceive and carry fetuses to parturition are under complex hormonal bal ances mediated by the anterior pituitary.\n\nThe mouse is polyestrous and cycles every 4 to 5 days. In the first two phases (proestrus and estrus), active epithelial growth in the genital tract culminates in ovulation. Degenerative epi thelial changes occur during the third phase, followed by di- Fig. 10 . Male reproductive tract. (From Cook, 1983.) estrus, a period of quiescence or slow cell growth. The cycle can be followed by changes in the vaginal epithelium that are often used to determine optimum receptivity of the female for mating and fertilization (Table VIII) . Patency of the vaginal orifice and swelling of the vulva are useful signs of proestrus and estrus. Irregularities of the estrous cycle occur during aging. Seasonal and dietary factors and genetic backgrounds also influence estrous cycles. A classical example of a dietary effect stems from estrogenic substances found in a variety of feeds.\n\nEstrus is routinely observed in mice at about 14-24 hr after parturition (postpartum estrus). However, cornification of the vagina is not complete and fertile matings are not as frequent compared to normal estrus. Mice are spontaneous ovulators. Ovulation does not accompany every estrus, and estrus may not coincide with every ovulation because estrus is dependent on gonadal hormones, whereas ovulation is responsive to gonadotropin. The cyclicity of estrus and ovulation are con trolled by the diurnal rhythm of the photoperiod. Mating, es trus, and ovulation most often occur during the dark phase of the photoperiod. Reversing the timing of the light-dark cycle reverses the time of estrus, ovulation, and mating.\n\nPheromones and social environment also effect the estrous cycle. For example, estrus is suppressed in mice housed in large groups due to pseudopregnancy or diestrus (\"Whitten effect\"). These effects can be counteracted by olfactory stim uli evoked by chemical signals (pheromones) from male mice. By contrast, pheromones from a strange male mouse, particu larly of a different strain, may prevent implantation or pseudopregnancy in recently bred females (\"Bruce effect\"). Estrus Bronson et al. (1966) . h + indicates many cells; + + indicates very many cells; ( -) indicates transition from epithelial to cornified. The smears given are typical; there is considerable variation.\n\ncan be synchronized by group housing females prior to pairing with males. Group housing suppresses estrus, but exposure to male pheromones restarts the cycle and leads to estrus in most females 3 days after pairing. The next estrus will occur in about 11 days.\n\nMating is normally detected by formation of a vaginal plug (a mixture of the secretions of the vesticular and coagulating glands of the male) whose prevalence is highly strain depen dent. The plug usually fills the vagina from cervix to vulva (Fig. 11 ). Plug detection is often coupled with vaginal cytol ogy to evaluate fertility and conception.\n\nWhen the cervix and vagina are stimulated physically during estrus, prolactin is released from the anterior pituitary to en able the corpus luteum to secrete progesterone. Secretion con tinues for about 13 days. If fertilization has occurred, the pla centa takes over progesterone production. If fertilization does not occur, a pseudopregnant period ensues, during which es trus and ovulation do not occur. Fertilization usually takes place in the ampulla or the upper portion of the oviduct. Ova can be fertilized to produce normal embryos for 10-12 hr postovulation.\n\nGestation is usually 19-21 days. Because of postpartum es trus, lactation and gestation can occur simultaneously. Lacta tion can delay gestation because of delayed implantation. This may cause prolongation of gestation for up to 12-13 days in certain inbred strains. \n\nThe effective reproductive life of some inbred strains ap proaches 2 years where optimum environmental conditions are maintained, but litter size usually decreases as the female ages. Therefore, females are usually retired by 1 year of age. Aver age litter size is strain dependent and commonly ranges from 1 to 12 pups.\n\nMaternal care can account for about 70% of the variation in body weight of neonatal mice. Nursing females usually lactate for 3 weeks. Milk production increases up to 12 days postpar tum, and then declines until weaning at 21 days. Transmission of passive immunity after birth by colostral antibodies has been demonstrated to a wide variety of antigens, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Antibodies continue to be secreted in the milk throughout lactation.\n\nMice are social mammals in which pheromones serve as a principal mechanism for communication (Table IX) . Phe romones have been divided into two broad categories, primer pheromones and releaser pheromones (Wilson, 1970) . Primer pheromones, are probably detected by chemosensor organs that relay messages to the CNS, which in turn modulates be havior. Releaser pheromones trigger a prompt, CNS-mediated, behavioral response in a recipient. Pheromones most fre quently affect developmental and reproductive processes. Primer pheromones produced by males also regulate the re productive physiology of female mice (Shorey, 1976) . More than one response can be elicited by the same pheromone. Pheromone communication must be accounted for in the manage ment of mouse colonies, particularly when subtle behavioral traits or reproductive performance are critical. Behavior in mice also is determined by environment and genotype. Male BALB/c mice, for example, are prone to fights and have a high prevalence of bite wounds around the head, back, shoulders, perineum, and tail. Aggressive behav ior can sometimes be diminished by caging together only males from one litter or males paired prior to weaning. Hair nibbling and whisker chewing are examples of social domi nance (Fig. 12 ). These traits may be an exaggeration of inher ited grooming behavior. Dominant mice usually retain their whiskers, hence the name ''barber\" mouse. Hair loss from barbering must be distinguished from hair loss due to ectoparasitism, microbial dermatitides, and abrasions from im properly designed cage covers. Maintenance behavior, such as eating and drinking, is cyclic and occurs mostly during the evening or at night.\n\nThe mouse is used in behavioral research, including behav ioral toxicology. The rat, however, remains a preferred model for behavioral testing (see Chapter 4 by Kohn and Barthold).\n\nThe diseases of mice surveyed in the following sections are divided into three categories: infectious, neoplastic, and noninfectious. Infectious diseases are emphasized since, as a group, they account for most of the health-related problems of mice. This section is an abridgement. In-depth discussion of each condition can be found in 'The Mouse in Biomedicai Re search,\" Volumes II and IV, the parent texts for this chapter (Foster et al., 1982a,b) .\n\nTyzzer's disease is named for Ernest Tyzzer, who first de scribed it in a colony of Japanese waltzing mice. The causative organism, Bacillus piliformis, is a long, thin, gram-negative spore-forming bacterium that appears to infect only living cells. It has not been grown successfully on cell-free media, but it can be propagated by inoculation of susceptible verte brates or the yolk sac of embryonated hens' eggs.\n\nClinically, Tyzzer's disease is frequently expressed as acute death that may be preceded by diarrhea (see reviews by Ganaway et ai, 1971; Ganaway, 1982) . Outbreaks can be explo sive, with high morbidity and mortality, but serological sur veys indicate that subclinical infection also occurs. Stresses, such as overcrowding, high temperature and humidity, moist food, and immunosuppression, may predispose mice to Tyzzer's disease, and there is evidence that susceptibility and resistance is influenced by host genotype.\n\nTyzzer's disease has been found in many species of laborato ry animals and in domestic and free-living species, but the res ervoir of environmental infection remains unknown. Because the vegetative form of Bacillus piliformis is unstable, the spore form probably constitutes the surviving form in the environ ment and the primary means of spread. Feces-contaminated food seems to be a likely source of infection, and soiled bed ding can harbor infectious spores for long periods. In utero infection can be induced by intravenous inoculation of preg-nant dams, but the prevalence of prepartum transmission in nature has not been determined.\n\nThe distribution of lesions reflects the pathway of infection. Macroscopically, the ileum and colon may be normal or red and dilated with watery, fetid contents. The liver often con tains one or more gray-white foci. Histologically, lesions are characterized by necrosis. In the intestine, necrosis of mucosal epithelium may be accompanied by acute inflammation and hemorrhage. In the liver, foci of coagulation necrosis are gen erally distributed along branches of the portal vein; a finding compatible with embolie infection from the intestine. Peracute lesions are largely free of inflammation, but neutrophils and lymphocytes may infiltrate less fulminant lesions. Myocardial necrosis occurs in some species (e.g., rabbit and rat), but is not commonly seen in the mouse.\n\nBundles of long, slender rods can be found in the cytoplasm of viable hepatocytes bordering necrotic foci (Fig. 13 ). Orga nisms are found more easily during early stages of infection. Organisms in tissue sections do not stain well with hematoxylin-eosin stain. Special preparations such as silver stains (Warthin-Starry), Giemsa stains, or periodic acid-Schiff stains are usually required. Bacilli can also be found in the epithelial cells of the intestine especially in association with focal necrotizing enterocolitis. \n\nTyzzer's disease is diagnosed most frequently by the demon stration of characteristic organisms in tissue sections of liver and intestine. Supplemental procedures include inoculation of cortisonized mice or embryonated eggs with suspect material followed by histological or immunocytochemical demonstra tion of organisms in tissues. Asymptomatic infection can be detected serologically with an immunofluorescence technique. The detection of organisms at the periphery of necrotic foci is key to differentiating Tyzzer's disease from other infections that can produce similar signs and lesions, especially mouse pox, corona viral hepatitis, reoviral hepatitis, and salmonellosis.\n\nThe control and prevention of Tyzzer's disease have not been adequately studied. Prevalence rates, reservoirs of infection, carrier states, and the mechanism of spread remain specula tive. A build up of spores in the environment or intercurrent immunosuppression might lead to fatal infection. It has been suggested that administration of tetracycline can avert epizoo tic infection, but it is unlikely that a spore-forming bacterium can be eliminated by the use of antibiotics. Therefore, total replacement of affected or exposed stock must be considered. Vaccination is not yet available.\n\nCitrobacter freundii can cause a natural epizootic disease of mice characterized by colonie mucosal hyperplasia and colitis. Typical Citrobacter organisms are motile, gram-negative aero bes that ferment lactose and utilize citrate as a sole source of carbon. The substrains associated with colonie hyperplasis are nonmotile and either fail to utilize citrate or do so marginally. Only the strain 4280, (API profile number)* has been associ ated with natural or experimental disease.\n\nIn natural outbreaks, retarded growth, ruffled fur, soft feces, rectal prolapse, and moderate mortality in late suckling and early weanling mice have been observed. Diarrhea has also been found with some regularity.\n\nThe prevalence of C. freundii infection in mouse colonies is unknown. Factors such as genotype, age, virulence of bacterial strains, and diet influence the course and severity of disease (Barthold et ai, 1977) . For example, DBA, NIH Swiss, and C57BL mice are relatively resistant to mortality; whereas C3H/HeJ mice are relatively susceptible both as sucklings and as adults. Dietary factors also modulate susceptibility to infec tion, but they have not been identified.\n\nThe pathognomonic gross finding is severe thickening of the descending colon, which is rigid and either empty or contains semiformed feces (Fig. 14) . The lesion lasts for 2 to 3 weeks in surviving animals. Histologically, mitotic activity in the Fig. 14. Colons of a normal mouse (right) and a mouse with transmissible murine colonie hyperplasia (left). The descending colon is thickened and opaque due to mucosal hyperplasia. (From Barthold et al., 1978 with permission.) mucosa of the descending colon is accelerated and may be as sociated with inflammation. At the height of disease, the hyperplastic mucosa has crypt epithelium that resembles undifferentiated cells normally found only at crypt bases. In young mice, spotty mucosal necrosis and inflammation are more common. Inflammation may subside after several weeks, and there is a decrease in mitotic activity. Repair is rapid and complete in adults but slow in sucklings.\n\nThe diagnosis of colonie hyperplasia depends on clinical signs, characteristic histological changes, and isolation of C. freundii 4280 from the gastrointestinal tract or feces (Barthold et al., 1978) . Citrobacterfreundii is relatively easy to culture during early phases of infection, whereas during later stages the intestine may be free of aerobic bacteria.\n\nSome success in curtailing epizootics has resulted from adding sodium sulfamethazine (0.1%), tetracyclines (450 mg/liter), or neomycin sulfate (2 mg/ml) to the drinking water. Because C. freundii may contaminate food, bedding, or water, proper disinfection of such materials is prudent before they are used for susceptible animals. Surveillance for C. freundii 4280 can be incorporated into a quality assurance program.\n\nThe potential effects on research of colonie hyperplasia as a clinically severe disease are obvious. Colonie hyperplasia also has been shown to increase the sensitivity of colonie mucosa to chemical carcinogens and to decrease the latent period between administration of carcinogen and the appearance of focal atypical cell growth (Barthold and Beck, 1980) .\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative, motile, nonspore-forming rod that inhabits moist, warm environments such as water, sewage, and skin.\n\nIt is an opportunist and may be shed in the feces or found in ROBERT O. JACOBY AND JAMES G. FOX the oropharynx, gastrointestinal tract, and nasopharynx. Infec tions are almost always silent, but immunologically compro mised animals are prone to septicemia (Brownstein, 1978) . Pseudomonas can, for example, cause severe or lethal infec tions in nude athymic mice. Sick mice may have equilibrium disturbances, conjunctivitis, serosanguinous nasal discharge, edema of the head, weight loss, and skin infections. Immunosuppressed mice may also develop gastrointestinal ulcers. Generalized infection is associated with severe leukopenia. Neurologic signs are rare, but there are reports of natural cen tral nervous system infection. Chronic proliferative inflamma tion in the cochlea and vestibular apparatus with dissolution of surrounding bone may be responsible for clinical signs of torticollis.\n\nOrganisms enter at the squamocolumnar junction of the up per respiratory tract and, in some cases, the periodontal gingiva. Bacteremia is followed by necrosis of liver and spleen, and the liver may undergo fatty change. The tympanic bullae may contain green suppurative exudate. The bowel may be distended with fluid, and gastrointestinal ulcers can occur.\n\nInfection is diagnosed on the basis of history (e.g., immunosuppression), clinical signs, lesions, and isolation of P. aeruginosa from affected mice. Carrier mice can be detected either by nasal culture of individual animals or by placing bot tles of sterile, nonacidified, nonchlorinated water on cages for 24 to 48 hr and then culturing the sipper tubes for Pseudomonas.\n\nInfection can be prevented by acidification or hyperchlorination of the drinking water. These procedures will not, howev er, eliminate established infections. Entry of infected animals can be prevented by surveillance of commercially procured colonies. Maintenance of Pseudomonas-free animals usually requires barrier quality housing and husbandry.\n\nPseudomonas infection will complicate experimental studies by causing rapidly fatal septicemia in immunosuppressed mice. Virus infections that alter host defense mechanisms, such as cytomegalovirus, may enhance susceptibility to the organism.\n\nPasteurella pneumotropica is a common gram-negative bac terium whose pathogenicity for otherwise healthy mice is prob ably minor. Many early observations concerning its pathogeni city are questionable because they were made on colonies of varying microbiological and virological status. There is senti ment for the view that P. pneumotropica is an opportunistic pathogen rather than a primary invader. Studies of experimen tal P. pneumotropica suggest that the organism may compli cate pneumonias due to Mycoplasmapulmonis or Sendai virus. Pasteurella pneumotropica can also cause local suppurative le sions in organs other than the respiratory tract. Conjunctivitis, panophthalmitis, dacryoadenitis, and infections of the bulbourethral glands have been attributed to this organism. It has been cultured from the uterus, but its role in metritis is unclear. There is evidence that it may cause infertility or abor tion. Pasteurella urea has also been recovered from mice with metritis. Pasteurella pneumotropica also has been isolated from suppurative lesions of the skin and subcutaneous tissue of the shoulders and trunk. Cutaneous lesions can occur without systemic disease. Pasteurella pneumotropica can be isolated from preputial and orbital abscesses especially in nude mice.\n\nDiagnosis is made by isolation of the organism. Serological techniques to identify carrier animals are not available. Antibi otic therapy with penicillin may be beneficial for individual animals, but it will not eliminate infection from an entire colony.\n\nSalmonellosis has been studied thoroughly in mice as a natu ral and as an experimentally induced infection (see review by Ganaway, 1982) . The mouse is also used to test the potency of vaccines used for protection of humans against typhoid fever. Modern production and husbandry methods have reduced the importance of Salmonella as a naturally occurring pathogen of laboratory mice. However, the organisms are ubiquitous in na ture and cross-infection from other species or from feral mice remains possible.\n\nThere are approximately 1600 recognized serotypes of Salmonella. The Salmonella most commonly isolated from mice is S. enteriditis serovar typhimurium, a gram-negative, slow lactose-fermenting rod.\n\nSalmonellae are primarily intestinal microorganisms and can contaminate food and water supplies. Infection occurs pri marily by ingestion. In a colony where vermin, birds, and feral animals are excluded, human carriers may be a source of infec tion. The induction and course of infection are influenced by the virulence of the organism, route of infection, dose of orga nism, age, sex, genetic factors, nutrition, and intercurrent dis ease. Stresses that suppress immunity such as X irradiation, corticosteroid administration, and exposure to heavy metals, and environmental factors such as temperature can alter ex pression of disease. Resistance to natural infection is increased by the presence of normal gastrointestinal microflora. For ex ample, more than 10 6 virulent S. enteriditis organisms are needed to establish lethal infection in conventional mice, whereas only a few organisms are required for lethal infection of germfree mice. Nutritional iron deficiency has an attenuat ing effect on Salmonella infection in mice, whereas iron over load appears to promote bacterial growth and enhance vir ulence. Resistance to infection also can be an inherited trait among inbred strains. Weanling mice are more susceptible to infection than older mice.\n\nFrank salmonellosis is rare in mice. If acute disease occurs, it is especially severe in young mice and is characterized by anorexia, weight loss, lethargy, dull coat, humped posture, and occasionally, conjunctivitis. Gastroenteritis is a common sign, but feces may remain formed. Subacute infection can produce distended abdomens from hepatomegaly and spleno megaly. Chronic disease is expressed by anorexia and weight loss. If salmonellosis is enzootic in a production colony, there are alternating periods of quiescence and high mortality, the latter being associated with diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss, roughened haircoat, and reduced production.\n\nThe virulence of S. enteriditis serovar typhimurium depends on its ability to penetrate intestinal walls, enter lymphatic tissue, multiply and disseminate. Organisms reach Peyer's patches within 12 hr after inoculation and spread quickly to the mesenteric lymph nodes. Bacteremia results in spread to other lymph nodes, spleen, and liver within several days. In chronic infections, organisms persist in the spleen and lymph nodes as well as the liver and gallbladder and from the latter are dis charged into the intestinal contents. Bacteria reaching the in testine can reinvade the mucosa and can be shed intermittently in the feces for months. Chronic arthritis associated with S. enteriditis infection has been reported.\n\nIn animals dying acutely there may be no gross lesions, but visceral hyperemia, pale livers, and catarrhal enteritis are com mon. If mice survive for up to several weeks, the intestine may be distended and reddened, while the liver and spleen are en larged and contain yellow-gray foci of necrosis. Affected lymph nodes are also enlarged, red, and focally necrotic. Focal inflammation can develop in many organs including the myocardium.\n\nMicroscopically, lesions reflect bacterial invasion, and the extent of lesions is proportional to the course of disease and the number of bacteria in the tissues. Necrotic foci are found in the intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. Neutrophilic leukocytes and histiocytes accumulate in lymphoid tissues. Thrombosis from septic venous embolism may occur especially in the liver. Granulomatous lesions are particularly characteristic of chronic salmonellosis.\n\nDiagnosis is based on isolation of salmonellae together with documentation of compatible clinical signs and lesions. In mice with systemic disease, bacteria may persist in the liver and spleen for weeks. During acute stages, bacteria can also be isolated from the blood. Asymptomatically infected animals can be detected by fecal culture using selective enrichment me dia. Confirmation of infection can be made serologically. Serotyping reagents aid speciation and can be obtained com mercially. Alternatively, samples can be sent to a reference laboratory for confirmation. Antibody to Salmonella can be detected in the serum of infected mice by an agglutination test, but this method is not entirely reliable because serological cross-reactivity is common even among bacteria of different genera.\n\nSalmonellosis can be prevented by proper husbandry and sanitation. Contact between mice and potential carriers, such as nonhuman primates, dogs, and cats, should be prevented. Diets should be cultured periodically to check for inadvertent contamination. Humoral and cellular immunity appear to be important in host defenses. Nevertheless, live, virulent, or at tenuated vaccines cannot prevent development of the carrier state and are not recommended. About 5% of vaccinated mice reportedly remain asymptomatic carriers. Antibiotic therapy can also enhance the prevalence of carriers. Therefore, con taminated colonies should be replaced to eliminate infection and its zoonotic potential.\n\nStreptobacillosis has historical importance as a disease of mice, but modern husbandry and production methods have re duced its impact dramatically. The causative agent, Streptobacillus moniliformis, is a gram-negative, pleomorphic bacillus that can exist as an L phase variant in vivo and in vitro. The L phase is considered nonpathogenic, but it can revert in vivo to the virulent bacillus form.\n\nStreptobacillosis generally has a 1-to 3-day acute phase with high mortality, followed by a subacute phase and then a chron ic phase that may persist for months. Signs of acute disease include a dull, damp haircoat and conjunctivitis. Variable signs include anemia, diarrhea, hemoglobinuria, cyanosis, and emaciation. In chronic infections, cutaneous ulc\u00e9ration, arthri tis, and gangrenous amputation may occur. The arthritis can leave joints deformed and ankylosed. Hindlimb paralysis with urinary bladder distention, incontinence, kyphosis, and priapism may occur if vertebral lesions impinge on motor nerves. Breeding mice may have stillbirths or abortions.\n\nStreptobacillus moniliformis is a primary pathogen for hu mans (rat bite fever, Haverhill fever) wherein the rat usually serves as a reservoir for dissemination of infection. Clinically healthy, but latently infected rats housed with mice have been implicated as a source of outbreaks. Transmission may occur from aerosol exposure, bite wounds, or contaminated equip ment, feed, or bedding (see Chapter 22).\n\nDuring acute disease in mice, necrotic lesions develop in parenchymal organs of the thoracic and peritoneal cavities. Histological lesions include septic thrombosis of small vessels, acute inflammation, fibrin deposition, and abscesses. Chron ically infected mice develop purulent polyarthritis because of the organism's affinity for bones and joints.\n\nDiagnosis depends on isolation of the organism. It has been recovered from joint fluid as long as 26 months after infection. Isolation from chronic lesions requires serum-enriched medium.\n\nClinical signs must be differentiated from mouse pox, Tyzzer's disease, corynebacteriosis, salmonellosis, mycoplasmosis, and lesions due to trauma.\n\nControl is based on prevention of exposure to wild rodents or to carrier animals such as latently infected rats. Bacterins, anti biotic therapy, and other treatments have proved only partially effective.\n\nCorynebacterium kutscheri, a short gram-positive rod, is a cause of pseudotuberculosis in laboratory animals. Latent in fections may be common in conventionally housed mice. Ac tive disease is precipitated by immunosuppression or environ mental stresses and is expressed as an acute illness with high mortality or a chronic syndrome with low mortality. Clinical signs include inappetance, emaciation, rough haircoat, hunched posture, hyperpnea, nasal and ocular discharge, cut aneous ulc\u00e9ration, and arthritis.\n\nLesions develop in various internal organs, such as kidney, liver, lung, and brain, from hematogenous spread. They are characterized by coagulative or caseous necrosis bordered by intense neutrophilic infiltration. Colonies of short gram-posi tive rods can usually be demonstrated in caseous lesions. Mucopurulent arthritis of carpal, metacarpal, tarsal, and metatarsal joints are related to bacterial colonization of synovium accompanied by necrosis, cartilage erosion, ulc\u00e9ration, and eventually ankylosing panarthritis.\n\nCorynebacterium kutscheri is not a primary skin pathogen, but skin ulcers or fistulae follow bacterial embolization and infarction of dermal vessels. Subcutaneous abscesses have also been reported.\n\nDiagnosis depends on isolation and identification of C. kutscheri. Agglutination serology is available, and immunofluorescent and immunodiffusion tests have also been re ported. However, the reliability of serological diagnosis has not been widely confirmed. The caseous nature of C. kutscheri-inductd lesions help to separate them from necrotic changes or abscesses caused by other infectious agents of mice. Because the lung is frequently involved, corynebac teriosis must be differentiated from streptococcosis and mycoplasmosis, neither of which is associated with caseous ne crosis. Recent evidence suggests that mice can sustain natural infections with Mycobacterium avium. Therefore, histochemical techniques for acid-fast bacilli and appropriate culture methods for mycobacteria should be considered when nodular inflammatory lesions of the lung are detected.\n\nBecause clinically apparent corynebacteriosis tends to occur sporadically, treatment and control are difficult. Antibiotic prophylaxis or therapy is probably ineffective. Culling of clinically ill animals may be useful for conventional colonies, but is of little use where animals will be severely stressed or immunosuppressed during experimentation. Replacing or rederiving infected colonies in a specific-pathogen-free environ ment can be effective in eliminating infection and in prevent ing reinfection.\n\nStaphylococci are found in the nasal passages of healthy mice and can occasionally invade adjacent bone and produce necrosis. The significance of staphylococcosis for mice rests predominantly, however, with its role in purulent dermatitis. Staphylococci produce lipolytic enzymes to counter the bac tericidal actions of skin lipids. Species common to the flora of the skin and mucous membranes of mice are Staphylococcus aureus, which is pathogenic, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is generally nonpathogenic.\n\nStaphylococcosis is probably an opportunistic infection. Some evidence suggests that staphylococci can produce prima ry cutaneous infections, but cutaneous lesions usually occur after contamination of skin wounds. Dermatitis develops pri marily on the face and neck and can progress to abscessation, cellulitis, and ulcerative dermatitis. Because lesions are often pruritic, scratching causes additional trauma and autoinoculation. Staphylococcal infection in the genital mucosa of males may produce preputial gland abscesses. These occur as firm, raised nodules in the inguinal region or at the base of the penis and may rupture to spread infection to surrounding tissues. Histologically, superficial staphylococcal infections occur as fibrinonecrotic lesions with neutrophils, but lymphocytes, macrophages and fibroblasts are common in chronic lesions. Deep infections appear as coalescing granulomas with necrotic centers containing bacterial colonies.\n\nThe prevalence of staphylococcal dermatitis appears to be influenced by host genotype, the overall health of the animal and the amount of environmental contamination with Staphylococcus. C57BL/6, C3H, DBA, and BALB/c mice seem to be most susceptible. Age may also influence susceptibility, young mice being more susceptible than adults. Immunodeficient mice (e.g., athymic mice) contaminated with sta phylococci often develop multiple abscesses. Once virulent staphylococci contaminate the environment, colonization of the gastrointestinal tract can occur and produce a carrier state. Human phage types of staphylococci can infect mice, but the zoonotic importance of this connection is not thoroughly understood.\n\nDiagnosis is made by isolation of gram-positive, coagulasepositive cocci that produce \u00df-hemolysis on blood agar. Phage typing can help to determine the source of infection. Gram stains of skin lesions should reveal gram-positive cocci, but diagnosis should not rest on histological findings alone.\n\nRemoval of affected animals, sterilization of food and bed ding, and frequent changing of bedding may limit or reduce transmission. Affected animals may be helped by trimming or amputation of the hind toes to reduce self-inflicted trauma. This procedure has proved moderately effective in rats with Staphylococcus-associated ulcerative dermatitis.\n\nMost streptococcal infections in laboratory mice are caused by organisms in Lancefield group C, but epizootics caused by group A and group D streptococci have occurred, and group G organisms have been isolated occasionally. Mice can carry streptococci asymptomatically in their upper respiratory tracts. Lethal epizootics can occur, but factors leading to clinical dis ease are unknown, although some infections may be secondary to wound contamination. Signs include depression, con junctivitis, rough haircoat, hyperpnea, and emaciation. En larged spleens with multifocal abscesses from hematogenous dissemination have been reported. A common streptococcal syndrome in mice is cervical lymphadenitis with fistulous drainage to the neck complicated by ulcerative dermatitis. Di agnosis depends on isolation of organisms from infected tissues combined with microscopic confirmation.\n\nEscherichia coli is not a major pathogen for mice. Serotypes pathogenic for some species are not necessarily pathogenic for others, but the enterotoxin plasmid can be transmitted between serotypes. This may account for occasional outbreaks of colibacillosis especially in conventionally housed mice.\n\nKlebsiella pneumoniae is a ubiquitous gram-negative oppor tunistic pathogen associated with urinary and respiratory tract infections in humans and in animals. Although capsule types 1 and 2 are highly virulent for mice, K. pneumoniae does not appear to be a significant cause of naturally occurring disease.\n\nClostridia are large, rod-shaped gram-positive anaerobic bacteria. Naturally occurring clostridial infection in mice is rare. Epizootics of Clostridium perfringens type D infection has been reported in a barrier colony where heavy mortality occurred in 2-to 3-week-old suckling mice. Clinical signs in cluded scruffy haircoats, paralysis of the hindquarters, and di arrhea or fecal impaction. Attempts to produce the disease ex perimentally with Clostridia isolated from naturally infected animals were unsuccessful.\n\nMycobacterium lepraemurium is a gram-positive acid-fast, obligate intracellular bacterium. It has been isolated from healthy laboratory mice and can persist as a latent infection (see review by Harkness and Ferguson, 1982) . On rare occa-sions, M. lepraemurium can cause a chronic granulomatous disease in mice exposed to infected wild rats, and there are reports of spontaneous clinical leprosy in mice. Murine leprosy can also be induced by inoculation with M. lepraemurium. C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice appear to be more susceptible than DBA/2 mice. Clinical signs include alopecia, thickening of skin, subcutaneous swellings, and ulc\u00e9ration of the skin. Disease can lead to death or clinical recovery. Gross lesions are characterized by nodules in subcutaneous tissues and in reticuloendothelial tissues and organs (lung, spleen, bone mar row, thymus, and lymph nodes). Lesions can also occur in lung, skeletal muscle, myocardium, kidneys, nerves, and adre nal glands. The histological hallmark is peri vascular granulomatosis with accumulation of large, foamy epithelioid mac rophages (leprae cells) packed with acid-fast bacilli. Research interest in murine leprosy stems from its similarities to human leprosy.\n\nProteus mirabilis is a gram-negative opportunistic pathogen that can remain latent in the respiratory and intestinal tracts of mice. Clinical disease can occur following stress or immunosuppression. For example, Proteus has been associated with ulcerative lesions in the gastrointestinal tract of mice that have been chemically immunosuppressed. Infected animals lose weight, develop diarrhea, and die within several weeks. If septicemia develops, suppurative or necrotic lesions may be found in many organs, but the kidney and especially the renal cortex is commonly affected. Proteus nephritis is characterized by abscessation and scarring. Ascending lesions, following uri nary stasis, for example, tend to involve the renal pelvis with only secondary spread to the cortex. Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been isolated concommitantly from cases of suppurative nephritis or pyelonephritis.\n\nMany leptospire species can infect laboratory mice, but in fection is generally asymptomatic. Nevertheless, latent murine infections associated with active shedding present a zoonotic hazard for humans; therefore infected mice should be dis carded (see review by Fox and Brayton, 1982) . Zoonotic out breaks from contact with mice have been associated primarily with Leptospira ballum, an organism that also infects rats. Be cause clinical signs and lesions of leptospirosis rarely develop, serological testing or isolation of organisms is the preferred means for diagnosis. Leptospires can occasionally be detected by dark field examination of body fluids or by staining histo logical sections by silver impregnation methods. Serological diagnosis can be made by a variety of tests, including indirect hemagglutination, macroscopic agglutination, complement fixation, and indirect immunofluorescence.\n\nSeropositive dams do not transmit organisms to their off spring, but seronegative carriers can spread infection. The ad ministration of chlorotetracycline hydrochloride (1000 gm per ton of feed) for 10 days is said to be an effective treatment. Mice are moved to autoclaved cages after 7 days and given sterile water. Nevertheless, elimination of infection usually re quires rederivation or total replacement of infected colonies combined with measures to prevent entry of infected wild or feral rodents.\n\nMurine respiratory mycoplasmosis is a syndrome charac terized by suppurative rhinitis, otitis media, and chronic pneu monia (see review by Lindsey et al., 1982) . Viruses and bacteria have been implicated as causative agents, but the clinical and morphological characteristics of the disease can be duplicated by experimental infection with Mycoplasma pulmonis.\n\nMycoplasma pulmonis is a pleomorphic bacterium of the sterol-requiring family Mycoplasmataceae. It lacks a cell wall and has a single outer limiting membrane. Colonies growing on agar have a fine granular appearance and may resemble fried eggs when viewed at low magnification. Mycoplasma pulmonis can ferment glucose but not arginine. Most isolates have up to three common antigens.\n\nAsymptomatic infection may occur, but mice commonly dis play chattering, inactivity, weight loss, rough haircoat, and dypsnea. Chattering and dypsnea are due to accumulations of purulent exudate in nasal passages together with inflammatory thickening of nasal mucosa. In the mouse, experimental MRM is highly dose dependent. Doses of 10 4 colony-forming units (CFU) or less cause mild transient disease involving the upper respiratory tract and middle ears, whereas higher doses often cause death from acute pneumonia that accompanies upper res piratory lesions. Survivors develop chronic bronchopneumonia with bronchiectasis and pulmonary abscesses and can spread disease to other mice. Intravenous inoculation of M. pulmonis can cause arthritis in mice, but arthritis is uncommon in natural infection. Rarely, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord may cause flaccid paralysis. Naturally occurring genital disease due to M. pulmonis has not been reported in mice, but experimen tal parenteral inoculation has caused oophoritis, salpingitis, and metritis. Mycoplasma pulmonis reportedly can also cause infertility or fetal deaths.\n\nThere is some evidence that mouse strains may differ in sus ceptibility to MRM, but this observation has not been verified experimentally. Systematic investigations of natural outbreaks are lacking. Transmission can occur between cage contacts and between adjacent cages. The offspring of infected dams proba bly acquire infection by aerosol transmission early in life. In utero infection of fetuses has been demonstrated in rats, but not in mice. Mycoplasma pulmonis is a serious pathogen of rats and has been isolated from hamsters, guinea pigs, and rab bits. Among these species only rats are significant reservoirs of infection for mice.\n\nThe primary lesion early in experimental or natural disease is suppurative rhinitis (Fig. 15 ), which can progress to prominent squamous metaplasia. Transient hyperplasia of submucosal glands may occur, and lymphoid infiltration of the submucosa can persist for weeks. Syncytia can sometimes be found in nasal passages in association with purulent exudate. Affected mice usually have suppurative otitis media and chronic laryngotracheitis with mucosal hyperplasia and lymphoid cell infiltrates.\n\nThe lung lesion is chronic bronchopneumonia that spreads from the hilus. Neutrophils accumulate in bronchial lumens, and large peribronchial clusters of lymphoid cells (primarily plasma cells) develop. Bronchial exudate can cause atelectasis, bronchiectasis, bronchiolectasis, and abscesses ( Fig. 16 ). Ad vanced lesions may be expressed macroscopically as a cob- Fig. 15 . Suppurative rhinitis in a mouse with Mycoplasma pulmonis infec tion. Note syncytia in surface epithelium. (From Lindsey et ai, 1982.) blestone appearance of the lung. Cuboidal epithelium often lines alveoli immediately surrounding affected airways, but pleuritis is rare.\n\nThe pathogenesis of cell injury in MRM is not well under stood, although it is known that M. pulmonis attaches or ad heres to host cell membranes as an initial event. This attach ment to respiratory epithelium occurs anywhere from the anterior nasal passages to the alveoli and may be mediated by surface glycoproteins. The organism may injure host cells through competition for metabolites such as carbohydrates and nucleic acids or by release of toxic substances such as perox ides. Ciliostasis, reduction in the number of cilia, and ultrastructural changes leading to cell death have also been de scribed in MRM.\n\nPrior infection with Sendai virus enhances the growth of M. pulmonis and the severity of lung lesions. Pasteur ella pneumotropica is thought by some to exacerbate the severity of respiratory disease from M. pulmonis, but this has not been confirmed experimentally.\n\nMice mount an effective immune response to M. pulmonis as measured by their recovery from mild infection and their re sistance to infection after active or passive immunization. Antibodies of various classes are produced locally and systemically, but their role in the disease is unclear. There is some evidence that antibody may facilitate phagocytosis of M. pulmonis. Classic cellular immunity, however, does not appear to play a major role in M. pulmonis infection in mice, since im munity cannot be transferred with immune cells. In addition, neither athymic nor neonatally thymectomized mice are more susceptible to M. pulmonis pneumonia than normal mice. By contrast, passive immunity in the rat can be transferred with immune spleen cells but not with seni m. Mice given more than IO 4 CFU can, however, develop severe chronic disease even in the presence of well-developed immunity. This has led to the suggestion that M. pulmonis infection has an immunopathologic component.\n\nClinical signs may not be pathognomonic during acute out breaks because they may be mimicked by other respiratory in fections, including Sendai virus pneumonia. Lesions are fairly characteristic, especially in advanced disease. The upper respi ratory tract should be cultured since it is a common site for natural infection. Buffered saline or Mycoplasma broth can be used to lavage the trachea, larynx, pharynx, and nasal pas sages. Genital tract infection may occur in the absence of res piratory infection, therefore, culturing at this site also is prudent.\n\nMycoplasmas may be difficult to grow on artificial medium but can generally be cultured in standard Hayflick's broth or Mycoplasma agar at 37\u00b0C. Cultural isolation can give good results if it is carefully done. Because the quality of the culture medium may vary from batch to batch, it is essential that it be pretested for its ability to support growth of stock strains. Cul ture vessels, water, and medium components should be of Fig. 16 . Mouse lung with advanced lesions of Mycoplasma pulmonis infection. Note massive accumulation of purulent exudate in the airways, bronchiectasis, bronchiolectasis, atelectasis, and peribronchial lymphoid cell infiltrates. (From Lindsey et al., 1982.) tissue culture quality. Growth can usually be detected in 1 week in agar or broth, but cultures should be held for 21 days before they are discarded as negative. Organisms can be identi fied by colony morphology, but M. pulmonis has little tenden cy to produce typical fried egg colonies under less than optimal growth conditions. Speciation can be accomplished by immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase staining or by growth in hibition. A rapid presumptive test is the hemadsorption test, but some strains of M. pulmonis do not hemadsorb.\n\nImmunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase techniques can also be used to identify mycoplasmal antigen in tissue sections or in cytological preparations of tracheobronchial or genital tract lavages. Conventional serological tests, such as comple ment fixation (CF), hemagglutination inhibition (HAI), and growth inhibition, have limited value for serological detection of mycoplasmosis because serum titers are usually low. More recently, a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a radioimmunosorbent assay, and a solid phase radioimmunoassay show promise of increasing the sensitivity and speed of serological detection (Cassell et al., 1981) .\n\nEffective control of MRM depends on prevention of infec tion through maintenance of pathogen free colonies. This im plies careful surveillance for infection by serology, microbiol ogy, and histopathology and adherence to rigid principles of barrier management. Cesarean derivation can eliminate infec tion, but fetal membranes and offspring must be tested to rule out transmission in utero. Treatment with tetracyclines sup presses clinical disease but does not eliminate infection. Effec tive vaccines are not available.\n\nMycoplasma pulmonis can interfere with research by causing clinical disease or death. Experiments involving the respiratory tract, such as inhalation toxicology, can be compromised by chronic progressive infection. Experimentally induced immunosuppression can enhance the pathogenicity of M. pulmonis. Conversely, altered immunological responsiveness of mice in fected with M. pulmonis is also a possibility because the orga nism is a mitogen for lymphocytes. In rats, M. pulmonis has been associated with an increased incidence of carcinogen-in duced cancers.\n\nMycoplasma neurolyticum is the etiological agent of rolling disease. Its natural prevalence in mice is rare. Clinical signs appear, however, within 1 hr after intravenous inoculation of M. neurolyticum exotoxin (Thomas et al., 1966) . They include spasmodic hyperextension of the head and raising of one fore leg followed by intermittent rolling on the long axis of the body. The rolling becomes more constant, but mice occasion ally leap or move rapidly. After 1 or 2 hr of rolling, animals become comatose and usually die within 4 hr. Mice of all ages appear to be susceptible.\n\nAll published descriptions of rolling disease are associated with experimental inoculation of organisms or exotoxin. Large numbers of organisms are needed to produce disease, and there is no indication that, under natural conditions, organisms repli cate in the brain to concentrations required for the induction of these signs. Because animals are frequently inoculated with biological materials by parenteral routes, contamination with M. neurolyticum may induce rolling disease inadvertently.\n\nMycoplasma neurolyticum exotoxin enters the brain from the vascular system and fixes to receptors on glial cells. Lesions are not striking in animals that die peracutely. If mice survive for 8 hr or more, astrocytes can undergo spongiform degenera tion from intracellular accumulation of fluid. The disruption of fluid transport with concomitant compression of neurons by swollen astrocytes may be responsible for the neurological signs. Mycoplasma pulmonis has been recovered from the brain of mice, but it does not seem to cause overt neurological disease.\n\nDiagnosis can be made from the appearance of typical clini cal signs, astrocytic swelling, and isolation of the causative organism. Clinical signs must be differentiated from rolling associated with Pseudomonas-caused otitis.\n\nThere is a recent report of naturally occurring infection with M. arthritidis in mice. The significance of this finding for epizootiological studies of MRM in mouse colonies is unclear.\n\nRickettsia are small, rod-shaped, coccoid, and occasionally pleomorphic organisms with typical bacterial cell walls but lacking flagellae. They are gram-negative and multiply by bin ary fission in host cells. Most rickettsia are transmitted by in sects. The organisms commonly infect reticuloendothelial cells, produce vasculitis, and destroy erythrocytes to cause hemolytic anemia. Few rickettsia cause natural disease in mice, although mice are susceptible to experimental inoculation with human rickettsia, including the organisms of scrub typhus and rickettsial pox.\n\nTwo rickettsia, Eperythrozoon coccoides and Hemobartonella muris, have historical importance for mice. The former is primarily an organism of mice and the latter, although infec tious for mice, is more commonly associated with rats (see review by Baker et al, 1971; Hildebrandt, 1982) . Both are transmitted by insects and destroy erythrocytes. Eperythrozoon occurs as a ring-shaped or coccoid organism and occasionally as a rod either on erythrocytes or free in plasma (Fig. 17 ). It is enclosed by a single limiting membrane, but has no cell wall, and no nucleus or other membrane-bound organelles. The nat ural vector for transmission is the mouse louse, Polyplax serrata. Infected mice remain clinically normal or may develop anemia and splenomegaly, become febrile, and occasionally die. Hepatocellular degeneration and multifocal necrosis have +\u00ccTLJP\u00b7\u00b7** **: Fig. 17 . Mouse blood infected with Eperythrozoon coccoides. Ring-shaped organisms are attached to erythrocytes and free in plasma. (From Baker et al., 1971, with permission.) been recorded in acute infections. Hemobartonella muris is not a major problem in mouse colonies. In nature, it is spread by the rat louse Polyplax spinulosa.\n\nRickettsial infections of rodents are long lived and are ex pressed clinically in one of two ways: acute febrile anemia and latent or asymptomatic infection. The latter can be reactivated by splenectomy, a procedure that ablates a major source of macrophages. The prevalence of carriers is not known, but the carrier state may be life long even when infection begins at an early age. Splenectomy is mimicked by irradiation, immunosuppressive therapy, anti-lymphocyte serum, and certain in tercurrent diseases. Conversely, E. coccoides may convert asymptomatic mouse hepatitis virus infection into a fatal dis ease. Other mouse viruses thought to be potentiated by E. coccoides are lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and lactic de ny drogenase-elevating virus.\n\nInoculation of test material into splenectomized mice is the most sensitive means of detection. Latent carriers can be un covered by this procedure, and rickettsemia usually begins in 48 hr. Because rickettsemia may be brief, blood smears should be prepared every 6 hr beginning at 48 hr postsplenectomy to assure that transient blood-borne infection is not missed. Smears are stained with a Romanovsky procedure to visualize parasites, but indirect immunofluorescence can also be used.\n\nTreatment of E. coccoides is not practical. Control is based on elimination of lice and on rederivation of infected stock. If replacement animals are readily available, euthanasia is a more prudent course. Biological materials destined for animal inocu lation should be checked for rickettsial contamination by inoc ulation of splenectomized mice.\n\nChlamydia are intracellular parasites that cause disease in many species of animals and in humans. They multiply intracellularly and form membrane-bound cytoplasmic inclusions.\n\nThe human organism, Chlamydia trachomatis, causes tra choma, conjunctivitis, lymphogranuloma venereum, and urogenital tract infections. A strain of this organism, the socalled \"Nigg agent,\" is thought to be responsible for an his torically noteworthy pneumonitis in mice. It was characterized clinically by ruffled fur and hunched posture with labored res piration and death in 24 hr. Mice dying more slowly showed progressive emaciation and cyanosis of the ears and tail. Gross findings included focal elevated grayish lesions in the lung. Their size progressed until total pulmonary consolidation oc curred. Microscopically, interstitial pneumonia developed. The disease resembled respiratory mycoplasmosis, and the Nigg agent was thought to be a causative factor for this condition.\n\nChlamydia psittaci infects many avian and mammalian spe cies. Latent infections have been recorded in mouse colonies. The agent can produce ascites, splenomegaly, and serofibrinous exudate on the liver and spleen. Nevertheless, it does not cause serious natural disease in mice. The fact that latent infec tions have been demonstrated indicates that surveillance may be advisable.\n\nMousepox is a devastating disease of mice caused by ectromelia virus, an orthopoxvirus that is closely related antigenically and physicochemically to vaccinia virus (see review by Fenner, 1982) . Mousepox was first reported by Marchai in England, and the causative virus was detected soon after by Barnard and Elford. Field strains of ectromelia virus have been isolated in many countries, but two strains, Hampstead (low virulence) and Moscow (high virulence), have been used ex tensively for laboratory study. Ectromelia virus grows well on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated chicken eggs and can also infect HeLa cells, human amnion cells, mouse fibroblasts (L cells), and chick embryo fibroblasts. The B-SC-1 cell line is particularly sensitive to ectromelia virus. Ectro melia virus produces an envelope hemagglutinin whose de tection forms the basis for hemagglutination inhibition (HAI), an historically important serological test for mousepox.\n\nMousepox usually takes one of three clinical courses: acute infection with high mortality, chronic infection with variable mortality, or asymptomatic infection. The expression of clini cal signs reflects an interplay between virus-related factors, such as virulence, and dose-and host-related factors, such as age, genotype, immunological competence, and portal of en try. Acute lethal infection occurs in genetically susceptible mice and may produce clinical signs, such as ruffled fur or prostration, for only a few hours before death. The rapidly fatal form of mousepox is associated with extensive necrosis of lymphoid tissue and liver and with intestinal hemorrhage.\n\nMice that survive acute infection often develop a skin rash whose severity depends on the extent of secondary viremia after infection of parenchymal organs. The pox rash can devel op anywhere on the body and may be solitary or generalized (Fig. 18 ). In some mice, conjunctivitis also occurs. The rash often recedes within several weeks, but hairless scars can re main. Severe viral infection of the feet and tail can lead to amputation; hence the name infectious ectromelia.\n\nNatural exposure is thought to occur through small abrasions of skin, but experimentally, oral exposure can cause chronic inapparent infection of Peyer's patches, prolonged excretion of virus in feces, and occasional chronic tail lesions. Mice with chronic intestinal infection appear not to readily transmit infec tion by contact, but carrier mice can be a source of contami nated tissue suspensions. Arthropod transmission is important for some pox viruses, but this appears not to apply to ectro melia virus, although the blood-sucking rat mite Ornithonyssus bacoti may be a passive vector. Intraperitoneal inoculation -d\u00a3rf? usually results in acute visceral lesions and death before prima ry skin involvement occurs. Intranasal infection can produce necrotizing rhinitis and pneumonia when large doses of virus are inoculated. Intrauterine infection and fetal deaths have been reported. Therefore contamination of cesarean-derived progeny or embryo-derived cell cultures has to be considered.\n\nThe laboratory mouse is the primary host for ectromelia virus, although infection of wild mice has been reported. Natu ral infections in other laboratory animals have not been con firmed, but poxlike viruses have been found in rats. Genotype can modulate the course and severity of infection. DBA/1, DBA/2, BALB/c, A, and C3H mice are among the most sus ceptible inbred strains, whereas C57BL/6 and AKR are re sistant to lethal infection (see review by Briody, 1959) . C57BL/6 mice may be resistant by virtue of their ability to mount rapid immune responses to ectromelia viral infection. Highly susceptible mice die from visceral infections before a skin rash develops; therefore they are a relatively small hazard for dissemination of virus. Resistant mouse strains are dan gerous because they can develop enzootic asymptomatic infec tions. Addition of susceptible strains to an enzootically in fected colony can provoke explosive lethal outbreaks. Intermediately resistant (or susceptible) mice frequently sur vive long enough to develop skin lesions that, aside from being extensive and unsightly, also can shed virus and serve as a major reservoir for spread of infection. Very young and aged mice seem to be more susceptible to lethal infection than are young adult mice.\n\nMousepox has been a common disease of mouse colonies in Europe, Japan, and China since 1930. It has been imported, inadvertently, to North America several times, and outbreaks have occurred periodically in the United States. In Europe, enzootic infections prevail in breeding colonies of resistant mice where clinical signs may be mild or inapparent. Maternal immunity may perpetuate infection by protecting young mice from death, but not from infection. Such mice can infect other mice by contact exposure. Ectromelia virus multiplies in the cytoplasm and produces two types of inclusion bodies. The A type (Marchai body) is acidophilic and is found primarily in epithelial cells of skin or mucous membranes (Fig. 19 ). The B type inclusion is basophilic and can be found in all ectromelia-infected cells if they are stained intensely with hematoxylin.\n\nThe pathogenesis of infection following skin invasion begins with viral multiplication in the draining lymph node and a pri mary viremia (Fig. 20) . Splenic and hepatic involvement begin within 3 to 4 days, whereupon larger quantities of virus are disseminated in blood to the skin. This sequence takes approx imately 1 week and, unless mice die of acute hepatosplenic infection, ends with the development of a primary skin lesion at the original site of viral invasion. The primary lesion is due ostensibly to the development of antiviral cellular immunity.\n\nFocal or confluent hepatocellular necrosis occurs in suscepti ble mice during acute stages of mousepox. White spots indica tive of necrosis are seen grossly throughout the liver. In nonfatal cases, regeneration begins at the margins of necrotic areas, but inflammation is variable. Splenic necrosis in acute disease commonly precedes hepatic necrosis but is at least equally se- vere. Necrosis and scarring of red and white pulp can produce a gross \"mosaic\" pattern of white and red-brown. Necrosis of the thymus, lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, intestinal mucosa, and genital tract also have been observed during acute infec tion, whereas resistant or convalescent mice can develop lymphoid hyperplasia.\n\nThe primary skin lesion, which occurs 6-10 days after ex posure, is a localized swelling that enlarges from inflammatory edema. Necrosis of dermal epithelium provokes a surface scab and heals as a deep, hairless scar. Secondary skin lesions (rash) develop 2 to 3 days later, are often multiple and wide spread, and can be associated with conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and, in severe cases, with buccal and lingual ulcers. Secondary skin lesions also ulcerate and scab before scarring.\n\nMousepox can be diagnosed from clinical signs, lesions, serological tests, and demonstration of virus or viral antigen in tissues. Characteristic intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions aid histological confirmation, and typical poxvirus particles can be found in tissues by electron microscopy. Fenner has suggested that demonstrating poxvirions in homogenized tissues or scabs from suspected cages could be a rapid method to diagnose mousepox. Virus can be isolated from infected tissues by inoculation of cell cultures (B-SC-1) or embryonated eggs.\n\nSeveral serological tests are available to detect mousepox. The standard test has been hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) using vaccinia antigen as a source of hemagglutinin. The HAI test has been valuable, but it has several potential pitfalls. Hemagglutinin-deficient mutants of vaccinia virus have been found (see below), and the possibility that similar ectromelia mutants can occur in nature has not been resolved. The HAI test also can give occasional false positive and false negative results, so it must be performed and interpreted by experienced personnel. Immunofluorescence, gel diffusion, or a recently developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) may eventually replace HAL Mousepox must be differentiated from other infectious dis eases associated with high morbidity and high mortality. These include mouse hepatitis, Tyzzer's disease, and reovirus 3 in fection. Each can be expressed by acute necrosis in parenchymal organs, but they can be differentiated by morphological, serological, and virological criteria. The skin lesions of chron ic mousepox must be differentiated from other skin diseases caused by opportunistic or pathogenic bacteria, acariasias, and bite wounds.\n\nSerological differentiation of mousepox from vaccinia infec tion in vaccinated mice is based on the lack of hemagglutinin in the vaccine strain of virus. Thus, serum from vaccinated mice may react in complement fixation (CF), immunofluorescent antibody (IFA), or ELISA tests, but should not react in HAI tests (Briody, 1959) .\n\nBecause mousepox is a dangerous disease in laboratory mice, depopulation coupled with vaccination is the primary means for control. Infection is sometimes disregarded in enzootically infected colonies of resistant mice. Elimination is still desirable under these conditions because of potential spread to susceptible mice.\n\nInfected colonies should be quarantined immediately, but confirmation of infection should be obtained before exposed mice are destroyed. Tissues, supplies, instruments, or other ner, 1948.) items that have had potential contact with infected mice should be disinfected by heat or chemicals (formalin or sodium hypochlorite). Materials should be autoclaved or, preferably, incin erated. Disinfected rooms should be challenged with suscepti ble sentinel animals that are observed for clinical signs and tested for seroconversion after several weeks. Depopulation and disinfection must be done vigorously. Culling is not a cur rently accepted alternative. Valuable mice, such as irreplacable breeding stock, can be retained in isolators for rederivation in lieu of prompt euthanasia.\n\nVaccination on a massive scale can effectively control or prevent clinical mousepox. A hemagglutinin-deficient strain of vaccinia virus (IHD-T) is used to scarify skin on the dorsum of the tail where ''takes'' can be easily read. Vaccination reac tions (Fig. 21) should occur in all previously uninfected mice by 6-10 days, but not in infected mice. The latter should be eliminated. Although vaccination can prevent clinical disease, it may not prevent infection, however transient. Therefore, vaccination should not lead to complacency in adherence to other preventive measures, such as strict controls on the entry of mice or mouse products combined with periodic serological monitoring.\n\nThe primary threat from ectromelia virus pertains to its le thality in susceptible mice. Infection from contaminated tissues, cell lines, or asymptomatically infected mice can pro duce explosive epizootics. Because the long-term epizootiological consequences of infection are still unresolved, es pecially in inbred mice, loss of time, animals, and financial resources are significant when current control measures are employed.\n\nb. Herpesvirus Infection (see review by Osborn, 1982) Two mouse herpesviruses have been identified: mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and mouse thymic virus (MTV).\n\n/. Mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) . Several isolates of MCMV have been studied. Their biological properties differ, but they are biophysically and antigenically similar. Mouse cytomegalovirus is infectious only for mice, but it can replicate in cell cultures from several species, including mouse, ham ster, rabbit, sheep, and nonhuman primate.\n\nMouse cytomegalovirus produces a spontaneous, persistent, subclinical infection in wild mice, but infection of laboratory mice is thought to be uncommon. The susceptibility of mice to experimental infection varies with age, dose, route, virus strain, and host genotype. The pathogenicity of MCMV for mice decreases with age, neonates being highly susceptible to lethal infection, and 4-week-old mice being highly resistant. Mouse cytomegalovirus can replicate in many tissues, and vir emia commonly occurs. Mouse cytomegalovirus often estab lishes persistent infection in the salivary glands and in the pan creas. The persistence of salivary gland infection appears to be dose dependent. There is experimental evidence that MCMV can produce latent infection of B cells, probably T cells, and possibly prostate and testicle (including spermatogonia). Renal infection is less severe and does not persist in mice as long as in CMV infection. Latent infection can be reactivated by lymphoproliferative stimuli and by immunosuppression.\n\nLesions are not remarkable during natural infection and may be limited to an occasional enlarged cell (megalocytosis) con taining an intranuclear inclusion together with some nonsup purative interstitial inflammation, especially in the cervical salivary glands. Experimental infection can induce necrosis and inflammation in parenchymal organs such as the liver, and intranasal infection, which probably mimics natural exposure, can produce a severe and even lethal interstitial pneumonia.\n\nBecause MCMV can be latent, its epizootological status in a colony can be difficult to determine accurately. Close contact Fig. 21 . Vaccination \"take\" in a mouse inoculated with the IHD-T strain of vaccinia virus. (From Jacoby et al., 1983.) is required for spread of infection in laboratory mice. Infected saliva contributes to horizontal transmission.\n\nMouse cytomegalovirus antigens appear to be weak stimuli for humoral antibody production. Complement fixing (CF) and neutralizing (NT) antibody titers are low during acute infection and difficult to find during chronic infection. Cellular immu nity, by contrast, appears to be important in protection against severe or lethal MCMV infection. Mouse cytomegalovirus can be grown in mouse embryo fibroblasts or 3T3 cells, but cocultivation may be required to rescue latent virus. Detection of enlarged cells with intranuclear inclusions especially in sali vary glands, can aid in diagnosis. A recent evaluation of MCMV antibody detection by serological techniques demon strated that the ELISA technique was more sensitive for detect ing persistent infection with MCMV, and nuclear anticomplement immunofluorescence was more useful for detecting acute MCMV infection (Anderson et ai, 1983) .\n\nMouse cytomegalovirus infection must be differentiated from infection with mouse thymic virus. The latter virus can produce necrosis and atrophy of thymic and peripheral lymphoid tissue. Lytic lesions of lymphoid tissues are not a hall mark of MCMV. The viruses can also be distinguished from each other serologically.\n\nControl measures for MCMV have not been established be cause it has not been considered an important infection of labo ratory mice. Cage to cage transmission has not been demon strated, but horizontal infection from contaminated saliva must be accounted for.\n\nMouse cytomegalovirus can suppress responses of mice to other antigens and may be autoimmunosuppressive and thus contribute to the virus' \"antigenic weakness.\" Mouse cytomegalovirus-induced immunosuppression also can exacer bate the pathogenicity of opportunistic organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\nii. Mouse thymic virus (MTV). Mouse thymic virus was discovered inadvertently during studies of mammary tumor virus and was so named for the thymic necrosis it causes in suckling mice. No suitable in vitro method for cultivation has been developed, therefore viral propagation depends on mouse inoculation.\n\nMouse thymic virus infection is usually asymptomatic, but it causes severe, diffuse necrosis of the thymus during the first week of life and persistent infection of salivary glands. In fected thymocytes display MTV-positive intranuclear herpetic inclusions. Necrosis is associated with granulomatous inflam mation and formation of syncytia. Necrosis and inflammation can also occur in lymph nodes. Reconstitution of lymphoid organs may take up to 8 weeks.\n\nThe prevalence of MTV in laboratory mice is not accurately known. The mode of transmission also is obscure, but the virus' sialotropism and its presence in the oral cavity of in fected adults suggests that horizontal spread occurs from dams to unprotected neonates.\n\nInfection is usually diagnosed from acute morphological changes together with intranuclear inclusions, but the severity of thymic and lymph node necrosis can be mouse strain depen dent and can also occur in severe mouse hepatitis virus or epi zootic diarrhea of infant mice infection. Serological confirma tion of infection can be obtained from adult mice by CF or NT tests. Neonatal mice inoculated with tissues (thymus, lymph node, salivary gland) from infected mice will develop thymic necrosis in 2 to 7 days. Mice infected as neonates do not devel op detectable antibody responses, but viral antigen can be demonstrated in the thymus by immunocytochemical staining. Because MTV induces persistent salivary infection, control measures suitable to acute infections, such as quarantine cou pled with temporary cessation of breeding, may not be effec tive. Rederiving or restocking affected colonies is a more ap propriate alternative, if infection cannot be tolerated as a research variable.\n\nMouse thymic virus transiently suppresses cellular and hu moral immune responses because of its destructive effects on neonatal T lymphocytes. Diminished responses to common antigenic stimuli, such as sheep erythrocytes and prolonged survival of allogenic skin grafts, have been demonstrated in experimentally infected mice.\n\nLactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus is a togavirus specific to mice and causes elevated levels of several serum enzymes, most notably lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), in infected mice (see review by Brinton, 1982) . The primary mode of transmis sion is mechanical transfer of tissues or serum from infected mice. Infection is asymptomatic, and the only significant le sion thus far associated with infection is polioencephalitis in old C58 mice that were immunosuppressed during early stages of infection, although there is evidence that T cell-dependent areas of thymus and peripheral lymphoid tissue may undergo mild necrosis early in infection.\n\nNatural transmission between cagemates or between mother and young is rare even though infected mice may excrete virus in feces, urine, milk and probably saliva. Infection by bite wounds or by ingestion of viral contaminated tissues cannot be ruled out.\n\nLactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus produces a lifelong viremia, and plasma LDH levels are permanently elevated, a response that is used to detect and titrate LDHV infectivity. Of the five isoenzymes of LDH in mouse plasma, only LDH V is elevated. SJL/J mice in particular show spectacular increases in LDH levels (15-20 times normal), a response controlled by a recessive somatic gene. Virus persists despite a modest hu moral antibody response, the latter being difficult to detect due to formation of virus-antibody immune complexes.\n\nAlthough neither clearance mechanisms nor their selectivity are fully understood, it is thought that viral interference with clearance functions of the reticuloendothelial network is a sig nificant factor in elevated blood levels of enzyme. Lactate de hydrogenase-elevating virus also interferes with the clearance of other serum enzymes and results in their elevation in serum. The mechanisms associated with this selective increase also are unclear. Immune complex glomerular disease is not a sig nificant complication of LDHV infection, despite the virus' propensity to form immune complexes.\n\nLactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus is detected by mea suring LDH levels in mouse plasma before and 4 days after inoculation of specific pathogen free (SPF) mice with suspect material. It is important not to use hemolyzed samples because they will produce falsely elevated readings. Plasma enzyme levels are measured in conventional units/ml, 1 conventional unit being equivalent to 0.5 IU. Normal plasma levels are 400-800 IU, whereas in LDH virus infection, levels as high as 7000 IU can be detected.\n\nAlthough LDHV can infect tumor cells, it does not replicate in them in vitro. Since LDHV is mouse specific, tumors can be freed of virus by passaging them several times in nonpermis sive rodents (e.g., rat) before repassaging them in mice. All tumors or cell lines destined for mouse inoculation should be monitored for LDHV contamination by plasma enzyme bioassay.\n\nLactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus has numerous poten tial effects on immunological responsiveness. It reduces autoantibody production, causes transient thymic necrosis and lymphopenia, suppresses cell-mediated immune responses, and enhances or suppresses tumor growth.\n\nLactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus has been found in more than 50 transplantable mouse tumors. Contamination probably occurred during passage of tumors through infected mice.\n\nLymphocytic choriomeningitis is caused by an arenavirus. It was initially isolated from three sources: monkeys inoculated with infected human tissues, albino mice, and humans, one of whom had worked with laboratory mice. It replicates by bud ding, and the viral envelope is formed by the cell outer mem brane. The virus contains single-stranded RNA and is sensitive to lipid solvents. Replication of infectious LCMV both in vitro and in vivo is associated with production of interfering virus.\n\nLymphocytic choriomeningitis virus strains vary in their rate of replication, tissue tropism, pathogenicity, immunogenicity, and replication, but they are closely related antigenically. These properties can, however, be modulated by passage in vivo or in vitro. Different biological properties have even been detected in LCMV recovered from different organs of the same mouse. LCMV can infect insect cells as well as mammalian in neonatally infected mice (see review by Lehmann-Grube, cells and can persistently infect naturally exposed mice and 1982). cultured cells.\n\nThe cerebral form of LCM is characterized by sudden death Clinical signs of LCMV infection vary with age and strain of beginning 5 to 6 days postinoculation or by subacute illness mouse, route of inoculation, and strain of virus. Four basic associated with one or more of the following signs: ruffled fur, patterns of clinical infection are recognized (Fig. 22): (1) the hunched posture, motionlessness, and neurological deficits. cerebral form-induced in adult mice by intracerebral inocula-Mice suspended by the tail will have coarse tremors of the head tion; (2) the visceral form-induced in adult mice by pe-and extremities culminating in clonic convulsions and tonic ripheral routes of inoculation; (3) late onset disease-found in extension of the hindlegs. Spontaneous convulsions also can previously asymptomatic carrier mice; (4) runting and death-occur. Animals usually die or recover in several days. Signs of visceral LCM can vary from asymptomatic infec tion to ruffled fur, conjunctivitis, ascites, somnolescence, and death. If mice survive, recovery may take several weeks.\n\nLate onset disease occurs in persistently infected mice when they are 9-12 months old. Clinical signs are nonspecific and include ruffled fur, hunched posture, weight loss, proteinuria, and ascites. Late onset disease is usually the result of prenatal or neonatal infection.\n\nRunting and death from LCM virus infection may occur in neonatally infected suckling mice and can lead to transient ill ness or to death. Clinical signs are nonspecific, recovery is slow, and survivors may remain smaller than unaffected mice. The cause of early deaths is not known, but the syndrome does not occur among offspring of congenital carriers.\n\nMice, hamsters, and humans are natural hosts for LCMV. Wild mice are a natural reservoir of infection and carrier labo ratory mice can infect animal colonies.\n\nLymphocytic choriomeningitis virus is distributed widely in North and South American and in Europe, but some areas of the world, such as Australia, appear to be free of infection. Although other common laboratory species, such as the guinea pig, are occasionally infected with LCMV, only the mouse and hamster are known to transmit virus. Carrier mice can have persistently high concentrations of virus in many organs, in cluding kidney and salivary gland. Mice can shed virus in sali va, nasal secretions, and urine and can infect contact-exposed mice. Horizontal spread is facilitated by close contact, but rapid horizontal transmission is not characteristic. Self-limit ing, immunizing infections occur in adults whereby further spread of virus is halted. If virus infects neonates, persistent infection is more commonly established. Persistently infected neonates usually reach breeding age and can perpetuate infec tion in a breeding colony. Thus introduction of a single LCMV carrier mouse to a breeding colony can eventually result in a high prevalence of persistently infected mice. Transmission in utero, is also a primary mode of spread. Horizontal transmis sion occurs commonly among hamsters. Mice transmit LCMV to hamsters, which in turn transmit virus to other hamsters, mice, and humans. Although hamsters can remain viremic and viruric for relatively long periods (months), most appear to eventually clear virus and recover (see Chapter 5).\n\nCentral nervous system lesions follow intracerebral inocula tion of virus but are not usually seen during natural infection. Nonsuppurative leptomeningitis, choroiditis, and focal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates are characteristic, but diffuse encephalitis does not occur. The mononuclear cell response during which host tissues are damaged reflects cellular immu nity to the virus. The character of visceral lesions depends greatly on virus strain and mouse strain. The severity of cytolytic lesions seems to parallel the intensity of cellular im munity. In severe infection, inflammatory lesions may be widely distributed in many organs. Liver lesions can include hepatocytic necrosis accompanied by nodular infiltrates of lymphoid cells and Kupffer cells, activated sinusoidal endothelium, an occasional granulocyte or megakaryocyte, and fat ty metamorphosis. Cytolysis, cell proliferation, and fibrinoid necrosis can develop in lymphoid organs. Necrosis of cortical thymocytes can lead to thymic involution. The ratio of cytoly tic to proliferative responses in lymphoid organs is also mouse strain dependent.\n\nLesions of late onset disease are strain dependent and charac terized by formation of immune complexes. Renal glomeruli (Fig. 23 ) and the choroid plexus are most severely affected, but complexes may also be trapped in synovial membranes, blood vessel walls, and skin. Lymphoid nodules can form in various organs.\n\nLesions associated with early deaths in neonatally infected mice have not been thoroughly described but include hepatic necrosis. The lesions of acute and persistent LCM infection reflect separate immunopathological processes. In adult mice with acute LCM, virus multiples in B cells and macrophages where as T cells are resistant. An internal viral antigen induces CF antibody, whereas surface antigens induce neutralizing anti body and probably cellular immunity. Thus elimination of virus and virus-associated immunological injury are both T cell mediated. This apparent paradox has been explained by the view that prompt cellular immunity limits viral replication and leads to host survival, whereas slower cellular immune re sponses permit viral spread and increases the number of virusinfected target cells subject to attack once immunity is fully developed. Antibody can be detected by 1 week after infection but does not play a significant role in acute disease.\n\nLesions of LCM appear to develop from direct T cell-medi ated damage to virus-infected cells and may involve humoral factors released from immune effector T cells. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis versus can also suppress humoral and cellular immunity in acutely infected mice, but the mechanism is not fully understood.\n\nPersistent infection commonly evolves from exposure early in pregnancy, and virus has been demonstrated in the ovaries of carrier mice. Prenatal or neonatal infection induces immu nological tolerance to LCMV, which can then replicate to high titer in many tissues. Nevertheless, persistently infected mice develop humoral antibody to LCMV. Antibody can complex with persistent virus to elicit complement-dependent inflam mation in small vessels. Immune complex glomerulonephritis, as described above, is a good example of this process.\n\nLymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection can be diag nosed serologically. Complement fixation and NT tests have been used with varying success, but a specific and sensitive IF A test is currently the preferred s\u00e9rodiagnostic method. Since carrier mice are persistently viremic, small blood sam ples (0.3 ml) can be collected from live suspects and used to inoculate cultured cells or for intracerebral inoculation of SPF mice. Intracerebral inoculation of LCMV-positive tissues will kill adult mice, but not neonatal mice. Adults develop neu rological signs within 10 days after inoculation or the donor may be assumed to be virus-free. Virus can be detected in brains of suckling and adult mice by immunofluorescence. Virus also can be grown and quantified in several continuous cell lines, including mouse neuroblastoma (N-18) cells, BHK-21 cells, and L cells.\n\nAlthough acute LCMV is usually asymptomatic, neurologi cal signs must be differentiated from those due to mouse hepa titis virus, mouse encephalomyelitis virus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, or parasitism. Trauma, neoplasia, and toxicities also must be ruled out in neurological disease with low prevalence. Late onset disease is associated with charac teristic renal lesions, including deposition of viral antigen in tissues. Early onset disease must be differentiated from other causes of early mortality, such as mouse hepatitis, mousepox, reovirus 3 infection, Tyzzer's disease, or husbandry-related insults.\n\nLymphocytic choriomeningitis virus is not prevalent in labo ratory mice produced and maintained in modern quarters. In troduction of infection usually occurs through inoculation of virus-infected biologicals, such as transplantable tumors, or through incursions by feral carriers. Adequate safeguards for procurement of animals and animal products are essential to prevent entry of infection. Surveillance of animal colonies and animal products by serological or virological testing supple ments this approach. Because mouse to mouse spread is slow, selective testing and culling for seropositive or carrier mice is possible. If mice are easily replaced, however, depopulation is a safer and more reliable option. Valuable stock can be rederived, but progeny must be tested to preclude in utero trans mission. Because infected hamsters can excrete large quan tities of virus, exposed hamsters should be destroyed and hamsters should not be housed with mice. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus is the primary viral infection of labora tory mice from which humans can contract severe illness. Therefore, it is important to detect and eliminate carrier ani mals and other potentially contaminated sources, such as cell cultures, transplantable neoplasms, and vaccines, before human exposure occurs (see Chapter 22). Periodic serological testing of high-risk human populations is recommended.\n\nLymphocytic choriomeningitis virus has been used exten sively to study the immunology and immunopathology of viral infection. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus may stimulate or suppress immunological responses in vivo and in vitro, and it can replicate in cells used as targets or indicators for immu nological studies. Introduction of immune cells to a carrier ani mal may elicit an immunopathological response. Immune complex disease can complicate long-term experiments and morphological interpretations. Illness and death in mice and zoonotic risks to humans are obvious hazards of LCMV infection.\n\nSendai virus is a paramyxovirus that was isolated in Japan in the early 1950's and is closely related antigenically to parainfluenza 1 virus of humans. There is no firm evidence, how ever, that cross-infection occurs between humans and mice. All isolates appear to be antigenically homologous but differ from each other in their virulence for cultured cells. Viral par ticles are pleomorphic, contain single-stranded RNA, and have a lipid solvent-sensitive envelope that contains glycoproteins with hemagglutinating, neuraminidase, and cell fusion proper ties. Sendai virus grows well on embryonated hen's eggs and in several mammalian cell lines [e.g., monkey kidney, baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) and mouse fibroblast (L)]. Virus replicates in the cytoplasm and by budding through cell outer membranes.\n\nNatural infections occur in mice (see review by Parker and Richter, 1982) , rats, hamsters, and guinea pigs, but the latter three species rarely show clinical signs. Ferrets and nonhuman primates can be infected intranasally, but only the former spe cies can develop severe pneumonia. Acute epizootics are com mon in previously uninfected mouse colonies and are charac terized by respiratory distress, neonatal mortality, retarded growth, and prolonged gestation. Weaning rates can decrease dramatically until infection subsides.\n\nSusceptible adult mice typically sit in a hunched position and have an erect haircoat. Rapid weight loss and dyspnea occur, and there may be crusting of the eyes and chattering. Severely affected adults may die.\n\nInfection is commonly more lethal in suckling mice and, to some extent, is more severe in aged mice than in young adults. Sex differences in susceptibility have not been found. Sendai virus is highly infectious, and morbidity in infected colonies is commonly 100%. Mortality in natural epizootics can vary from 0 to 100% partly because strains of mice vary greatly in their susceptibility to lethal Sendai virus infection (Table X) . Resistant mice usually have asymptomatic infection, es pecially if they are otherwise in good health. Athymic mice and immunosuppressed mice are at high risk. However, they develop illness later than their immunocompetent counterparts, and infection can persist for 10 or more weeks.\n\nSendai virus is transmitted by aerosol or by contact. Air borne infection is promoted by high relative humidity and by low air turnover.\n\nInfection is perpetuated by the introduction of susceptible animals. It may be inapparent or it may be expressed as acute clinical disease or inapparent enzootic infection. Enzootic in fection is commonly detected in postweaned mice (5-7 weeks old) and is associated with seroconversion and persistence of circulating antibody for at least a year (Fig. 24 ). There is no evidence for chronic or persistent infection in imunocompetent mice.\n\nGross lesions are characterized by partial to complete consol idation of the lungs. Individual lobes are meaty and plum-col ored, and the cut surface may exude a frothy serosanguinous fluid. Demarcation between normal and pneumonic zones is usually distinct. Pleural adhesions or lung abscesses caused by secondary bacterial infection are seen occasionally, and fluid may accumulate in the pleural and pericardial cavities.\n\nHistologically, typical changes begin with inflammatory edema of bronchial lamina propria, which may extend to al veolar ducts, alveoli, and peri vascular spaces. Necrosis and exfoliation of bronchial epithelium ensues, frequently in a seg mentai pattern. Alveolar epithelium also may desquamate, es pecially in severe disease, and necrotic cell debris and inflam matory cells can accumulate in airways and alveolar spaces. Alveolar septae are usually infiltrated by leukocytes to produce interstitial pneumonia. Lymphoid cells also invade epibronchial and perivascular spaces. Regeneration and repair be gin shortly after the lytic phase and are characterized by hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia of bronchial epithelium, which may extend into alveolar septae (Fig. 25) . Proliferation of cuboidal epithelium may give terminal bronchioles an adenomatoid appearance.\n\nRepair of damaged lungs is relatively complete in surviving mice, but lymphocytic infiltrates, foci of atypical epithelium, and mild scarring can persist. Multinucleated syncytia are oc casionally seen in affected sucklings, and inclusion bodies have been reported in infected athymic mice. In the latter, mortality is often extremely high, and acute phase lesions are prolonged.\n\nAfter intranasal exposure, virus can be found transiently in extrahepatic tissues, but replication is nominally restricted to the respiratory tract. Parenteral inoculation of Sendai virus can Parker and Reynolds, 1968.) produce infection of parenchymal tissues, but this effect is considered an experimental artifact and is rel\u00e8vent only be cause such tissues may be inadvertently contaminated with Sendai virus during experimental procedures.\n\nSendai virus-infected mice are less able to clear bacteria from the lung. This may be due to defective intracellular killing of phagocytized bacteria by Sendai virus-infected pulmonary mac rophages. It also helps to explain why secondary bacterial pneu monias can supercede primary Sendai virus infection. Sendai virus infections are self-limiting because of a vigorous immune response, but interferon may also play an early role in recovery. Suckling mice from immune dams are passively immune until maternal antibody has decayed, usually shortly after weaning. The lymphocytic response to Sendai viral infection suggests that cellular immunity contributes to recovery, but the mechanism is not clear. Local immunoglobulin synthesis by infiltrating cells also occurs. The extent of inflammatory cell infiltration corre sponds to the level of genetic resistance expressed by the in fected host, susceptible hosts mounting a more florid response than resistant hosts. It has been suggested that this apparent paradox may indicate an immunopathological mechanism in the development of Sendai viral pneumonia.\n\nBecause only one serotype is known, serodiagnosis is an ef fective means to detect exposure to infection. Although several Richter, 1973.) serological tests are available (HAI or CF procedures have been used traditionally), the ELISA or an IFA procedure offer superior sensitivity and specificity. Antibody can be detected in sera by 7 days postinfection. It should be remembered, how ever, that seroconversion indicates exposure to virus but does not confirm the stage of infection. Therefore, criteria such as histopathology and virus isolation should be used, or sentinel animals should be added to seropositive colonies to determine if infection is active. Virus can be isolated from the respiratory tract for up to 2 weeks, with peak titers occurring at about 9 days postinfection (Fig. 26) . Nasopharyngeal washings or lung tissue homogenates are most reliable and should be inoculated into embryonated hens' eggs or BHK-21 cell monolayer cul tures. Alternatively, repeated serological sampling over sever al weeks can help establish the incidence and prevalence of infection. An increase in both parameters indicates active infection.\n\nSendai viral pneumonia must be differentiated from other pneumonias of mice. Pneumonia virus of mice (Section III,A,3,f) is generally milder and asymptomatic. Bacterial pneumonias of mice are sporadic and can be differentiated morphologically and culturally. The same is true of murine respiratory mycoplasmosis. Because Sendai viral pneumonia may predispose the lung to opportunistic bacterial infections, the presence of bacteria should not deter evaluation for a pri mary viral insult.\n\nControl and eradication measures must eliminate exposure of susceptible animals so that infection can \"burn itself out.\" This is most easily accomplished by a quarantine period of 4-6 weeks wherein no new animals are introduced either as adults or through breeding. Physical facilities that permit specific pathogen-free husbandry are preferred for prevention and for control of room to room spread. If Sendai virus-free mice are held in conventional quarters, laminar airflow cabinets or iso lators can be used effectively when they are combined with proper sanitation and traffic patterns. The recent introduction of filter frame cages is a promising alternative for protecting animals housed in conventional environments.\n\nVaccination with formalin-killed Sendai virus can provide short-term protection of valuable mice (e.g., breeding stock). It is likely that the killed vaccine will be supplanted with a temperature-sensitive mutant strain of virus. The advantages of vaccination must be weighed carefully in light of experimental objectives and the ability to interpret serological results of sur veillance procedures.\n\nSendai virus may have broad and prolonged effects on im mune responsiveness, particularly in the direction of immunosuppression. For example, it seems to interfere with the abil ity of mouse lymphocytes to respond to mitogenic stimuli. Sendai virus can also inhibit growth of transplantable tumors. This effect has been attributed to virus-induced modification of tumor cell surface membranes. Pulmonary changes during Sendai viral pneumonia can compromise interpretation of ex perimentally induced lesions and may lead to opportunistic in fection. The use of genetically susceptible mice and nonim mune young stock for research must allow for potential hazards of Sendai virus epizootics.\n\nPneumonia virus of mice is a heat labile pneumovirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. It is a single-stranded RNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm and buds from cell outer mem branes. All isolates appear to have similar physicochemical, Parker and Reynolds, 1968.) biologic, and antigenic properties. The virus agglutinates erythrocytes of several rodent species including mice. Pneu monia virus of mice replicates exclusively in the respiratory tract and reaches peak titers in the lung 6-8 days after infec tion. It replicates well in vitro in BHK-21 cells.\n\nPneumonia virus of mice causes natural infections of mice (see review by Parker and Richter, 1982) , rats, hamsters, and probably other rodents. Serological evidence suggests that it also may be infectious for rabbits and nonhuman primates. Similarly, impressions that inbred strains of mice differ in sus ceptibility to infection have not been studied systematically. Natural PVM infection in mice is asymptomatic. Experimen tally infected mice may lose weight, develop listlessness, and have clinical signs of pneumonia.\n\nSerological data indicate that PVM is highly prevalent in mice and that it has a world-wide distribution. However, it appears to spread less rapidly than Sendai virus in a given colo ny. Infection is thought to be acute and self-limiting. Because the virus is rapidly inactivated, intimate contact between mice is probably required for effective transmission.\n\nPulmonary consolidation can occur in experimentally in fected mice, but gross lesions are not easily detected during natural infection. A recent report describes lesions associated with a natural outbreak of PVM in mice. Histological lesions consisted of desquamation of bronchial epithelium with forma tion of bronchial plugs, hyperemia and edema of alveolar walls, and alveolar septal infiltration by neutrophils and mac rophages. Immunofluorescence revealed viral antigen in bron chial epithelium, alveolar macrophages, and possibly alveolar epithelium.\n\nThe diagnosis of PVM is based primarily on serological de tection that can be supplemented by histopathology and by virus isolation. The HAI test using mouse erythrocytes has proved highly reliable. Titers of 1 :20 or greater from unpooled samples are considered significant. An ELISA has re cently been developed and is purported to be up to eight times more sensitive than HAI for detection of seroconversion. This may be important for the detection of PVM since HAI titers are frequently low. An IFA test also is available. Virus isolation in BHK-21 cells is detected by cytopathic effect, hemagglutinin production, or hemadsorption. Viral antigen can also be de tected by immunofluorescence.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of PVM is problematical, since it is clinically asymptomatic and lesions are not well charac terized. It must be differentiated from other viral pneumonias (e.g., Sendai viral pneumonia). Because PVM is antigenically distinct from other murine viruses, serology is the most useful method to separate it from other respiratory infections.\n\nPneumonia virus of mice is an acute, self-limiting infection, therefore control and prevention follow guidelines used for Sendai virus. Vaccination is not available.\n\nK virus is a papovavirus that is antigenically distinct from polyomavirus. It contains double-stranded DNA that is stable for more than 2 weeks at room temperature and that is rela tively resistant to heat and chemical inactivation. Reliable cell culture systems for in vitro cultivation have not been devel oped, but the virus replicates in mice.\n\nNatural disease is asymptomatic. Inoculation of virus or virus-contaminated materials into neonatal mice can, however, provoke dyspnea and lead to death in less than 24 hr (see re view by Parker and Richter, 1982) . Resistance to lethal experi mental infection develops between 8 and 18 days postpartum.\n\nK virus is thought to be distributed worldwide. The preva lence of infection in individual colonies can vary, but serologi cal surveys suggest it is usually low. There is some sentiment, however, that serological testing may not accurately determine the prevalence of latent enzootic infection.\n\nThe natural history of K virus infection is not well under stood. Immune mothers confer passive immunity on their lit ters, therefore infant mortality is rare. After weaning, mice sustain asymptomatic infection that may be prolonged and as sociated with excretion of virus in the urine, feces, and perhaps saliva. Virus can be detected in a variety of tissues and fluids, including the mammary glands, saliva, lung, liver, spleen, in testinal contents, blood, and urine. Oral-fecal transmission may be important, because virus can replicate in intestinal epithelium.\n\nGross lesions are limited to the lungs and can include hemor rhage, congestion, edema, atelectasis, consolidation, and pleural effusion. Histological changes occur in endothelial cells of small pulmonary and hepatic blood vessels. These cells have swollen nuclei with prominent intranuclear inclusion bodies that are amphophilic or basophilic when stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Fig. 27) . Inclusion bodies may also be found in renal glomeruli and in jejunal villous endothelium. Infected endothelial cells swell and desquamate and can cause vascular occlusion. Pulmonary vascular lesions may be accom panied by alveolar septae thickened by mononuclear infil trates. Alveoli in experimentally infected mice may fill with proteinaceous material. Peribronchiolar and perivascular lymphoid aggregates are not typical of K virus. Livers of experi mentally infected mice can develop a ''Swiss cheese ap pearance\" due to formation of membrane-lined spaces. Hepatocellular necrosis and inflammation may occur, but they must be carefully differentiated from intercurrent infection with other agents such as mouse hepatitis virus and ectromelia virus. The presence of intranuclear inclusion bodies in K virusinfected endothelial cells is a helpful marker.\n\nDiagnosis is made from clinical signs, virus isolation, histo pathology, and serology. Complement fixation and HAI tests can be used, but the former appears to be more sensitive. Anti body titers of 1 : 10 or greater are considered significant for either test. Recently developed immunofluorescence tests are also useful.\n\nK virus infection is commonly latent and chronic with low prevalence and low antibody titers, therefore selection of mice for serological sampling must be done carefully. It may be necessary to test large numbers of animals at frequent intervals to conclude that a population is free of infection.\n\nVirus isolation is relatively easy. Suckling mice are inocu lated (usually intracerebrally) followed by demonstration of sheep erythrocyte agglutinins in suspensions of visceral tissue and by specific inhibition of hemagglutination with anti-K virus reference serum. A recently developed immunofluores cence technique also is useful for demonstrating viral antigen.\n\nBecause infection is persistent and asymptomatic, rederivation is preferred if K virus must be eliminated. Maintenance of animals in strict barrier conditions can prevent reinfection.\n\nTransplantable neoplasms can become contaminated with K virus during passage in infected mice. K virus also may exac erbate mouse hepatitis virus infection.\n\nThe causative agent, EDIM virus, is a rotavirus of the family Reoviridae. The term rotavirus is derived from the wheel-like ultrastructural appearance of the virus. Currently, only a single antigenic strain is recognized, but experience with rotaviruses of other species suggests that antigenically distinct variants ex ist. The EDIM virus shares an inner capsid antigen with other rotaviruses but can be differentiated from other rotaviruses by serum neutralization tests. The virus contains RNA and repli cates in epithelial cells of the small intestine by budding into cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum. Intestinal infection may be related to a receptor on the villous brush border of the intes tine. The EDIM virus is difficult to grow in vitro despite at tempts using cell lines from several species embryonated hen eggs or mouse intestinal organ cultures. The virus is heat labile.\n\nClinical signs are prevalent only in suckling mice (see review by Kraft, 1982) . Mild disease is characterized by fecal soiling of the perineum and, in severe cases, of the entire pelage. Some mice may develop rectal impaction and die, but high morbidity and low mortality are more characteristic. Affected mice continue to nurse, but weight loss does occur and there may be delays in reaching adult weight.\n\nEpizootic diarrhea of infant mice virus appears to be infec tious only for mice. All ages and both sexes can be infected, but genetic resistance and susceptibility have not been deter mined. The virus is highly infectious and is transmitted by oral contact. Fomites, arthropods or humans, cannot be excluded as passive vectors. Transplacental transmission has not been demonstrated. Asymptomatically infected adult mice can shed virus in feces for at least 17 days. After oral inoculation, virus is essentially restricted to the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the small and large intestine, although small amounts of virus may be present in liver, spleen, kidney, and blood. Nursing dams can contract infection from their litters.\n\nThe virus is probably distributed worldwide, but its preva lence in mouse colonies has not been systematically investigat ed primarily due to the absence of reliable serological tests. Some seasonal periodicity in attack rates has been observed; the incidence being higher during winter.\n\nGross lesions are primarily limited to the gastrointestinal tract, but thymic atrophy is common. Fecal soiling of hair is caused by yellow to gray-green gaseous liquid or mucoid feces that also distends the colon. The stomach contains curdled milk except in terminal cases with anal impaction. Subtle histological changes occur in the small intestine. Increased vac-uolation of villar epithelial cells with cytoplasmic swelling give villi a clubbed appearance and must be differentiated from normal absorption vacuoles in nursing mice. Fuchsinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions have been reported in villar epi thelium during early stages of disease, but are, at best, a vari able finding. Necrosis and inflammation are not characteristic ofEDIM.\n\nEpizootic diarrhea of infant mice is diagnosed from clinical signs, histology, and demonstration of virus. Until recently, reliable serological tests have not been available, but a new immunofluorescence test and an ELISA may fill this deficien cy (Sheridan et al., 1983) . Virus can be detected by inocula tion of suckling mice with clarified intestinal suspensions or by placing sentinel litters in suspect colonies. Intestinal filtrates or smears can also be examined ultrastructurally by conventional or immune electron microscopy.\n\nEpizootic diarrhea of infant mice must be differentiated from other diarrheal diseases of suckling mice such as intestinal coronavirus infection (mouse hepatitis), reovirus 3 infection, Tyzzer's disease, and salmonellosis. The possibility of dual infections must also be considered. Thymic atrophy in EDIM, although nonspecific, must be differentiated from that due to MHV or MTV infection.\n\nThe spread of EDIM is effectively controlled by the use of filter bonnets and good sanitation. Since disease appears to be acute and self-limiting, cessation of breeding for 4-6 weeks to allow immunity to build in adults while preventing access to susceptible neonates is also effective. Alternatively, litters with diarrhea can be culled in combination with the use of bonneted cages. Litters of immune dams are more resistant to infection. Prevention of EDIM infection depends on mainte nance of sanitary barrier housing.\n\nReovirus 3 is an orthoreovirus of the family Reoviridae. A number of wild-type and laboratory strains have been charac terized, and related viruses have been recovered from mam mals, marsupials, birds, insects, and reptiles. The virion con tains double-stranded RNA and is relatively heat stable, but temperature-sensitive mutants have also been developed. Re ovirus 3 can be distinguished antigenically from reoviruses 1 and 2. Reoviruses replicate well in L cells and other continu ous cell lines as well as in primary monolayer cultures from several mammals.\n\nClinical expression of reovirus infection is age dependent. Acute disease affects sucklings and weanlings, chronic disease is encountered in mice older than 28 days, and adults com monly have asymptomatic infection. Clinical signs of acute disease include emaciation, abdominal distension, and oily, matted hair due to steatorrhea from decreased lipase and amylase activity. Icterus may develop in the feet, tail, and nose. Incoordination tremors and paralysis occur just before death. Convalescent mice are often partially alopecie and are typically runted. Alopecia, runting, and icterus may persist for several weeks, even though infectious virus can no longer be recovered (see reviews by Kraft, 1982; Stanley, 1978) .\n\nReovirus 3 can be transmitted orally or parenterally. There is no evidence that vertical transmission is important or that ge netic resistance or sex influence expression of disease. The true prevalence of reovirus 3 infection in laboratory mice is unresolved, but it is known to exceed 80% in some colonies.\n\nInfection can be pantropic in mice. After parenteral inocula tion of sucklings, virus can be recovered from the liver, brain, heart, pancreas, spleen, lymph nodes, and blood vessels. Fol lowing ingestion, reoviruses gain entry by infecting intestinal epithelial cells (M cells) that cover Peyer's patches. Virus can be carried to the liver in leukocytes where it is taken up by Kupffer cells prior to infecting hepatocytes.\n\nIn acute disease, livers may be large and dark with yellow foci of necrosis. The intestine may be red and distended, and, in infants, intestinal contents may be bright yellow. Myocardial necrosis can evoke pale epicardial foci, and pulmonary hemorrhages have been reported. Myocardial edema and ne crosis are especially prominent in papillary muscles of the left ventricle. The brain may be swollen and congested.\n\nCentral nervous system lesions are most prevalent in the brainstem and cerebral hemispheres. Neuronal degeneration and necrosis are followed quickly by meningoencephalitis and satellitosis. Severe encephalitis may evoke focal hemorrhage. In the chronic phase, wasting, alopecia, icterus, and hepatosplenomegaly may persist.\n\nGastrointestinal lesions are often mild and may be limited to lymphatic dilatation. On the other hand, orally infected suck ling mice can develop multifocal hepatocytic necrosis, which may include the accumulation of dense eosinophilic structures resembling Councilman bodies. Hepatocytomegaly, Kupffer cell hyperplasia, and intrasinusoidal infiltrates of mononuclear cells and neutrophilic leukocytes can develop. In experimen tally inoculated mice, necrotic foci can persist in the liver for at least 4 weeks. Chronic active hepatitis may develop after acute infection and result in biliary obstruction.\n\nAcinar cells of the pancreas and salivary glands can undergo degeneration and necrosis. Because pancreatic duct epithelium is susceptible to infection, parenchymal lesions in pancreas may be caused by obstruction rather than by viral invasion of parenchyma. Pulmonary hemorrhage and degeneration of skel etal muscles also has been observed.\n\nBoth humoral and cellular immunity seem to participate in host defenses. How this influences chronic infection is not clear.\n\nThe diagnosis of infection is aided by detection of the oily hair effect, a phenomenom that is said to be typical for reovirus 3, especially if it is accompanied by jaundice and wasting.\n\nHistological lesions characterized by necrosis and inflamma tion of liver, pancreas, salivary gland, heart, or brain are also helpful but must be differentiated from those caused by mouse coronaviruses, ectromelia virus, or Bacillus piliformis. Serological detection is used routinely because infection is often asymptomatic, especially in adults. Unfortunately, the commonly used HAI test is subject to false negative and false positive results. Neutralization tests are more accurate but are expensive and time consuming. Recently, ELISA and IFA tests have been developed and seem to offer improved specific ity and sensitivity. Reovirus 3 can be recovered by inoculation of mouse L cells and several other continuous cell lines.\n\nSince the course of typical infections is not well docu mented, especially for inbred mice, the potential for a carrier state is unresolved. Therefore, it may be necessary to rederive or replace infected stock. Prevention depends on adequate bar rier husbandry coupled with regular serological monitoring.\n\nReovirus 3 infection can interfere with research in at least several ways. Infections in breeding colonies can result in high mortality among sucklings from nonimmune dams. Virus has been recovered from transmissible neoplasms and is suspected of being oncolytic. The potential exists for interference with hepatic, pancreatic, cardiovascular, or neurological research.\n\nMouse coronaviruses are pleomorphic, enveloped RNA vi ruses with radially arranged peplomers characteristic of coro naviruses. They were first recognized through studies of the neurotropic and hepatotropic strain, JHM. A number of strains have since been identified and differ from one another in vir ulence, tissue tropism, and antigenicity. They have been grouped for convenience under the name mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), even though hepatitis does not always occur during natural infection. Five prototype strains are commonly referred to: JHM (MHV-4), MHV-1, MHV-3, MHV-S, and MHV-A59. Mouse hepatitis virus strains share internal antigens that can be detected by CF tests, but the viruses can be dis tinguished from each other by neutralization tests for strainspecific envelop antigens. Mouse hepatitis virus shares com plement-fixing antigens with rat coronaviruses, a finding that has been exploited to develop heterologous antigens for serological tests. Several strains of MHV also are related to human coronaviruses C38, OC43, and HCV-229E. It has been suggested that antibody to MHV in human sera can result from infection with antigenically related coronaviruses, but this has not been confirmed experimentally.\n\nMurine coronaviruses develop exclusively in cytoplasm and bud into cytoplasmic cisternae. Several tissue culture systems are available for in vitro propagation of virus. A line of mouse liver cells, NCTC 1469, is particularly useful for growing most strains. Cytopathic effects may differ from strain to strain, but syncytium formation is a commonly observed change. Mouse hepatitis virus can also be grown in mouse macrophages, cells that have been used for genetic studies of resistance and sus ceptibility to MHV-2.\n\nClinical signs of MHV infection depend on a number of fac tors, including age and strain of mouse, virus strain and trop ism, and the presence of enhancing or inhibitory factors in mice or their environment (see review by Kraft, 1982) . Acute MHV is most prevalent in young mice. Suckling mice can de velop diarrhea, inappetance, dehydration, weight loss, lassi tude, and ruffled hair (Fig. 28) . These signs are seen in various combinations and often terminate in death. A virus previously referred to as lethal intestinal virus of infant mice (LIVIM) is most likely an enterotropic variant of MHV and produces signs identical with many of those just listed. Neurotropic variants such as JHM may induce flaccid paralysis of the hindlimbs. Conjunctivitis, convulsions, and circling may be seen occa sionally. Mouse hepatitis virus in athymic (nu/nu) mice can be particularly devastating and usually causes a wasting syndrome that may be accompanied by generalized progressive paralysis. Mouse hepatitis virus infection, especially in adults, also can be asymptomatic and is often detected by seroconversion or by its influence on research.\n\nMouse hepatitis is, for all practical purposes, an infection of mice. However, there is a recent report that suckling rats de veloped necrotizing rhinitis after intranasal inoculation with MHV-S. Resistance to severe or lethal infection decreases as mice mature, but sex differences in susceptibility or seasonal periodicity have not been found. Mouse hepatitis virus has a world-wide distribution, and infection rates for individual Fig. 28 . Mouse pups from a litter naturally infected with an enterotropic strain of MHV. Upper mouse appears normal and stomach is filled with milk, whereas its littermate (lower pup) is runted, dehydrated, and has an empty stomach. (From Barthold et al., 1982.) colonies can vary from 20 to 100%. Natural transmission can occur through respiratory or oral routes. Feces, nasopharyngeal exudates, and perhaps urine can serve as sources of infec tion. Experimental data suggest that vertical transmission is possible, but natural vertical transmission has not been confirmed.\n\nThe course of natural MHV varies with virus strain and host strain. Prolonged infection in experimentally inoculated mice suggests that viral persistence in asymptomatic carriers is a potential means for spread of virus in a colony. The continuous introduction of susceptible offspring helps to propagate infec tion. Transmission of MHV by injection can also be an impor tant epizootiological factor in the laboratory.\n\nStrain differences in resistance and susceptibility can be in herited as an autosomal dominant trait. C3H/RV mice, for ex ample, are resistant to MHV-2, but are \"semi-susceptible\" to MHV-3. During infection with the latter strain of virus, mice that survive acute disease develop chronic illness with wasting and occasionally become paralyzed. DBA/2 mice are highly susceptible to MHV-3 and die acutely even as adults, whereas A/J mice develop resistance to lethal infection shortly after weaning. Some work suggests that susceptibility to MHV is influenced by at least two major genes, one which modulates acute disease and a second, linked to the H-2 complex, that modulates chronic disease. Mildly pathogenic strains may not cause acute disease in athymic mice, but rather a progressive wasting syndrome.\n\nThe distribution and severity of lesions in MHV depend on multiple factors, among which are viral tropism and host age. In susceptible weanlings and adults, yellow-gray foci of hepa tic necrosis are seen with varying frequency. Icterus, san-guinous peritoneal exudates, or intestinal hemorrhage may ac company hepatic lesions. In suckling mice, focal spotting of the liver may occur, but intestinal lesions are more common. The stomach is often empty, and the intestine is filled with watery to mucoid yellowish, sometimes gaseous contents. Hemorrhage or rupture of the intestine can occur.\n\nHistologically, hepatic necrosis can be focal or confluent and may be infiltrated by inflammatory cells (Fig. 29) . Syncytia commonly form at the margin of necrotic areas and, in mild infections, may develop in the absence of frank necrosis. Intes tinal lesions can be found at all levels and range from syncytium formation to necrosis and inflammation with severe blunting of surviving villi. Syncytia can often be found in asymptomatic adults on careful examination of intestinal mucosa (Fig. 30) . Necrosis and syncytia have also been de tected in spleen, stomach, lymph nodes, and pancreas. In athymic mice, syncytia occur in many tissues, and hepatic ne crosis can be extensive.\n\nNeurotropic variants, such as JHM, produce central nervous system lesions after invasion of the nasal passages. Necrosis predominates in the hippocampus and olfactory lobes, whereas demyelination, secondary to viral invasion of oligodendroglia, occurs in brainstem and in periepdendymal areas.\n\nHepatotropic strains of MHV cause damage to liver after parenteral inoculation by extension from littoral cells to hepatocytes. Neurotropic strains reach the nervous system after parenteral inoculation but can also penetrate the cribiform plate to the olfactory bulbs after initial replication in nasal mucosa. Recent work also indicates that the respiratory tract is a major portal of entry for MHV and primary lesions (syncytia) in pul monary vascular endothelium. Enterotropic strains can pro-IA fife ^ 3> *\u00b7' >-*W\u00a9 Tv\u00b7-\u00bb''?* Barthold.) duce syncytia and necrosis in the intestine after oral exposure and can contaminate the hepatic portal system to produce le sions in the liver and elsewhere.\n\nHumoral and cellular immunity appear to participate in host defenses to infection; a primary role being played by mac rophages. Age-related resistance to MHV correlates with ma turation of lymphoreticular subpopulations. The role of Inter feron in MHV infection is unclear, but it has been suggested that susceptibility of suckling mice is caused by low serum levels of interferon coupled with macrophage sensitivity to vir al replication. Mouse hepatitis virus-induced interferon can also modify responses of mice to nonreplicating antigens such as sheep erythrocytes.\n\nClinical and epizootiological signs of MHV infection are not pathognomonic for diagnosis. Mouse hepatitis virus must be differentiated from other infectious diseases that cause diarrheal illness, runting, or death in suckling mice. These include EDIM, mousepox, reovirus 3, Tyzzer's disease, and salmonellosis. Neurological signs must be differentiated from mouse encephalomyelitis, M. neurolyticum toxicosis, or noninfectious CNS lesions, such as neoplasms or musculoskeletal degeneration.\n\nSentinel athymic mice can develop clinical disease if they are placed among asymptomatically infected mice. Immunosuppression with adrenal corticosteroids or alkylating agents can also unmask asymptomatic MHV. Asymptomatic MHV infec tion is, however, commonly detected and differentiated from other murine viral infections by serological tests. The CF test has been used traditionally, but it is relatively insensitive. Newer serological assays, such as ELISA and immunofluorescence, are significantly more sensitive and are easy to perform. Serum neutralization can be used to detect envelope antigens specific for individual virus strains.\n\nMorphologically, syncytium formation with or without ne crosis is highly characteristic of MHV infection. Viral antigen can often be demonstrated in affected tissues by immunocytochemistry; a technique amenable to paraffin-embedded specimens (Brownstein and Barthold, 1982) .\n\nVirus can be isolated in mouse liver cell line NCTC-1469. Syncytium formation and necrosis occur within several days, and the careful observer can differentiate among prototype strains by the character of their cytopathic effects.\n\nControl and prevention of mouse hepatitis can be difficult because of the spectrum of virus-related, host-related, and en vironment-related factors that influence the expression and course of infection. The increased sensitivity of newer serological tests presents an additional problem in that MHV is being detected in colonies previously thought to be free of in fection. Another major but ill-defined variable is the potential for persistent infection. Some virus-host combinations are ex pressed as acute self-limiting infections, whereas other com binations appear to elicit chronic infection. Recent in vitro studies indicate that cells can be persistently infected with MHV in the presence of anti-MHV antibody. Therefore, con trol measures for individual outbreaks should account for the possibility of persistent infection.\n\nMethods for control of MHV should be tailored to research objectives. Valuable breeding colonies may benefit from cesarean rederivation if vertical transmission of infection can subsequently be ruled out. Depopulation, disinfection, and re stocking of infected rooms is suitable where replacement ani mals can be obtained commercially. Short-lived infection in a breeding colony would be amenable to a brief cessation of breeding to permit immunity to develop. However, this pro cedure would be relatively ineffective for persistent infection. Control of feral mouse populations, proper husbandry and san itation, and strict monitoring of biological materials that may harbor virus (e.g., transplantable neoplasms) will help prevent entry of virus. The prevention of MHV follows recommenda tions common to many murine virus infections; procure ani mals from virus-free colonies and maintain them under strict barrier conditions that are monitored by a well-designed quali ty assurance program.\n\nBecause MHV is ubiquitous and often clinically silent, it is a major potential influence on research using mice. It may immunosuppress or stimulate immune responses, contaminate transplantable neoplasms, and be reactivated by treatment of asymptomatically infected animals with several classes of drugs including immunosuppressive agents and by intercurrent infections (K virus, Eperythrozoon coccoides). It also can alter liver enzyme levels.\n\nMinute virus of mice is a parvovirus that was originally iden tified as a contaminant of a stock of mouse adenovirus. It is highly contagious and highly prevalent in wild and laboratory mice. Because it is small and contains single-stranded DNA, it has also been studied extensively at the molecular level as a model for viral genetics and for viral pathogenetic mechanisms (see review by Ward and Tattersall, 1982) . It agglutinates mammalian erythrocytes, and each viral serotype displays specificity for the species of red cells it will agglutinate. The virus replicates in monolayer cultures of rat or mouse embryo cells, and resulting cytopathic effects include development of large intranuclear inclusion bodies. Minute virus of mice is antigenically distinct from rat parvoviruses. However, antisera to rat virus (Kilham) and to H-l virus, can detect MVM-infected rat cells in vitro. This suggests that a common murine parvoviral antigen is expressed during infection of rat cells.\n\nNatural MVM infection is essentially asymptomatic. Young mice in enzootically infected colonies are protected by mater nal antibody, sustain active infection as weanlings, and devel op active immunity. Virus is excreted in feces and urine and is very stable to drying. Transmission occurs by oronasal ex posure. Continuous contact exposure produces seroconversion within 3 weeks, but limited contact exposure results in delayed seroconversion. Seroconversion is often accompanied by pro longed elevation of circulating antibody titers, an effect indica tive of persistent and probably lifelong infection. Infectious virus can, in fact, be isolated from mice with high HAI anti body titers.\n\nMinute virus of mice is only moderately pathogenic for mice, but it is teratogenic in neonatal hamsters and produces mongoloid deformities. Retarded growth and granuloprival cerebellar hypoplasia can develop after intracerebral inocula tion of neonatal mice. Contact exposed neonates occasionally develop cerebellar lesions. Passively immune suckling mice can pass through the age of maximum susceptibility without ill effects. Infection of adult mice causes viremia, but lesions are not found. Virus also can replicate in fetal tissues without in ducing lesions.\n\nBecause clinical signs are unreliable and because virus is es sentially nonpathogenic for all but nonimmune neonatal mice, serology is the primary method used to detect infection. The HAI test is widely used but the serum of some inbred mice may contain nonspecific inhibitors that can elicit false positive reac tions. Therefore nonspecific inhibition should be excluded dur ing testing procedures. An IFA test can be used to confirm seroconversion since it appears not to suffer from nonspecific inhibition.\n\nMinute virus of mice can be isolated from spleen, kidney, intestine, and other tissues by inoculation of C-6 cells, a rat glial cell line. Virus can also be detected by the mouse anti body production test (see Chapter 26).\n\nBecause MVM induces persistent infection, rederivation is a preferred means to eliminate the virus. Control and prevention also depends on strict barrier husbandry. Routine serological surveys should be made of populations at risk.\n\nMinute virus of mice contamination of transplantable neo plasms is quite common, therefore infection can be introduced to a colony through inoculation of contaminated cell lines. Failures to establish long-term cell cultures from infected mice or a low incidence of tumor takes should alert researchers to the possibility of MVM contamination. Because lymphotropic, immunosuppressant strains occur in nature, it is important for experimental oncologists and immunologists to have their ani mals and cell cultures monitored regularly for MVM.\n\nThe causative agent, mouse encephalomyelitis virus (MEV), is a small RNA-containing enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae. It was discovered by Max Theiler during his studies of yellow fever. Several strains are recognized including TO (Theiler's original) and GD strains I-VII, which are named after George Martin (George's disease), a laboratory techni cian who worked in Dr. Theiler's laboratory. Mouse encepha lomyelitis virus is thought to be moderately to highly prevalent in conventional mouse colonies.\n\nThe biological behavior of MEV allows its separation into two subgroups: highly virulent isolates that cause acute infec tion and less virulent isolates that produce persistent infection of the CNS (see review by Downs, 1982) . The virus is rapidly destroyed by temperatures over 50\u00b0C and by hydrogen perox ide at 37\u00b0C, 50% acetone, or alcohol but MEV is not inacti-vated by ether. The virus has a hemagglutinin, that is useful for serological testing. It can be cultivated in vitro in several con tinuous cell lines, but BHK-21 cells are routinely used for iso lation and propagation.\n\nClinical responses to MEV infection depend on the virus strain, the route of exposure, and the strain of mouse. The most common response is asymptomatic infection. The charac teristic but rarely observed sign of natural infection is flaccid paralysis of the rear legs, while the tail remains mobile (Fig.  31) . Paralysis may be preceded by weakness in the forelimbs or hindlimbs. Some mice may recover from paralysis, but death frequently ensues. The course of disease may be exacer bated by a failure to obtain food or water and by urinary incon tinence. Mice that recover from the paralytic syndrome are dis posed to a chronic demyelinating phase, which is expressed clinically as a mild gait disturbance. The SJL/J strain is more prone to develop severe chronic demyelinating disease than other inbred strains tested thus far. During the poliomyelitic syndrome, virus can be present in the brain and spinal cord for at least 1 year. Virus also replicates in intestinal mucosa and is excreted in feces. However, studies on persistent excretion from the gastrointestinal tract have not been done. Young mice acquire intestinal infection shortly after weaning, but virus can be recovered only irregularly in mice over 6 months of age. Immunity to one strain of MEV engenders cross-protection to the other strains. There are no reports of strain differences in mice with respect to susceptibility to infection under natural conditions or following inoculation.\n\nMouse encephalomyelitis viruses occur naturally only in colonies of laboratory mice with the exception of the MGH strain, which has been isolated from laboratory rats. There are no reports of MEV in wild mice. Infant cotton rats, hamsters, and laboratory rats are susceptible to intracerebral inoculation.\n\nThe poliomyelitis-like disease described above is charac terized morphologically by acute necrosis of ganglion cells neurophagia and peri vascular inflammation, particularly in the ventral horn of the spinal cord gray matter. In demyelinating disease, mononuclear cell inflammation develops in the leptomeninges and white matter of the spinal cord. Patchy demyelination is seen in areas of inflammation. The white matter lesions are similar to those seen in experimental allergic en cephalomyelitis and can be halted by chemical immunosuppression.\n\nClinical diagnosis is made by recognition of paralyzed mice, an event that occurs rarely (about 1 in 10,000 infected ani mals). Neurotropic variants of MHV may, on occasion, elicit similar signs. Injury to the spinal cord can also produce pos terior paralysis. Infection is usually detected serologically using the HAI test, a test prone to false positive and false nega tive reactions, or by the serum neutralization test, which is more precise, but which is also expensive and time consuming. A recently developed ELISA shows promise of increased spec- ificity and sensitivity. Histological lesions in the CNS and es pecially the spinal cord are characteristic when present. Virus can be isolated by mouse inoculation with fecal material or by inoculation of BHK-21 cells with intestine or CNS tissue. Brains of paralyzed mice can be tested for MEV hemagglutinin using type O human red blood cells.\n\nDisease-free stocks were originally developed by foster nurs ing infant mice. This technique or cesarean derivation tech niques can be used successfully to eliminate infection. In either case, foster mothers should be surveyed in advance to ensure their MEV-free status. Mouse encephalomyelitis virus appears to spread slowly, and, under some conditions, selective culling can eliminate infection. Because the virus is hardy in the en vironment and resists chemical deactivation, the safest course is to destroy animals, wash and disinfect the room and equip ment thoroughly, and reintroduce virus-free stock.\n\nThe principal hazard of MEV for research relates to its po tential effects on the CNS.\n\nMouse adenovirus is a heat-labile DNA virus that produces intranuclear inclusions in infected cell cultures and animals. Many adenoviruses express hemagglutinins, but murine adenoviruses do not. Some strains of human adenovirus are oncogenic for hamsters, but mouse adenovirus isolates have not shown oncongenic potential.\n\nTwo distinct strains of mouse adenovirus have been identi fied. The FL strain produces a rapidly fatal infection in suck ling mice characterized by necrosis of brown fat, myocardium, adrenal cortex, salivary gland, and kidney. Infected tissues also develop type A intranuclear inclusion bodies. Adult or weanling mice are resistant and merely seroconvert. A second strain of virus, designated K-87, is essentially nonpathogenic and tends to localize in the intestine, where it also produces intranuclear inclusions in intestinal epithelium. Both strains will replicate in mouse kidney tissue culture, but are antigenically distinct. Cross-neutralization tests have revealed, however, that antiserum to K-87 neutralizes both virus strains but antiserum to FL only weakly neutralizes K-87. Partial cross-reactivity has also been detected by complement fixation.\n\nExperimentally inoculated mice may remain persistently in fected and can excrete virus in the urine for at least 2 years. Spontaneous adenovirus infection has been recorded for athymic mice wherein amphophilic inclusion bodies were found in mucosal epithelium of the small intestine.\n\nThe overall prevalence of mouse adenovirus infection ap pears to be significantly lower than that of other common murine viral agents. Caesarean derivation of infected mice seems to abrogate enzootic infection.\n\nPolyoma virus is a small DNA virus in the papovavirus B group. It is highly antigenic in adult mice, whereas neonatally infected mice develop tumors. It is resistant to heat (60\u00b0C for 30 min) and chemical disinfectants.\n\nPolyoma-induced tumors are primarily a laboratory phe nomenon and seldom occur under conditions of natural infec tion. Inoculation of neonatal mice with contaminated biologicals or cell cultures is a potential source of spread. Tumors appear 2-12 months after inoculation, and, in most strains of mice, the salivary glands are prevalent sites for tumor develop ment. However, tumors can occur at other sites, especially in skin adnexae, the upper gastrointestinal tract, and the kidneys. The location of tumors varies with virus strain and, to some extent, with the route of inoculation. Intranasal exposure is believed to be the primary natural route of infection, whereas ingestion is not an efficient method of transmission.\n\nPolyoma virus exists in nature most commonly as a silent infection. Infected animals can be detected serologically with the HAI or CF test. Infection can be confirmed by virus isola tion. Young mice are important in virus dissemination because virus can multiply to high titer before antibodies develop. Virus also can persist in food and soiled bedding.\n\nControl depends on elimination of infected mice and material together with prevention of airborne spread. Polyoma infection can affect experiments by stimulating or repressing infection with other microorganisms or by eliciting tumors. Hsu, 1982) Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous gram-negative coccidian parasite for which the mouse serves as a principal intermediate host, the definitive host being domestic and wild felids. Tachyzoites proliferate in mouse cells and form pseudocysts that lack a well-defined membrane. In contrast to the tachyzoite, the bradyzoite multiplies slowly within a true parasitic cyst. Therefore, it is less susceptible to proteolytic enzymes. These cysts occur in tissues and grow by endodyogeny and represent a resting stage of Toxoplasma. Cysts can contain numerous crescent-shaped bradyzoites and persist in muscular and neural tissues.\n\nThe pathogenicity of Toxoplasma infection depends on the number and virulence of infecting organisms and on the route of infection. Natural infections of laboratory mice are usually acquired by ingestion of food or water contaminated with sporulated oocytes from cats, but congenital transmission can also occur. Pregnancy, lactation, immunosuppression, or concur rent infection with other agents exacerbate susceptibility.\n\nToxoplasmosis can cause necrosis and granulomatous in flammation in the intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes, eyes, heart, adrenals, spleen, brain, lung, liver, placenta, and mus cles. Animals commonly recover from natural infection and develop humoral and cellular immunity with cysts being formed in various organs.\n\nThe diagnosis of T. gondii infection is based on immunochemical methods (CF, hemagglutination, Sabin-Feldman dye tests, IFA, ELISA, toxoplasmin skin tests, or lymphocyte transformation). Histological examination and experimental inoculation of immunosuppressed animals are also useful.\n\nThe prevalence of T. gondii infection in laboratory mice is low. Control and prevention depend largely on precluding ac cess of mice to cat feces or to materials contaminated with cat feces. Oocytes are very resistant to adverse temperatures, dry ing, and chemical disinfectants, therefore thorough cleaning of infected environments is required.\n\nResearch complications associated with toxoplasmosis in mice include prolonged immunosuppression, macrophage ac tivation, and enhanced protection of mice against unrelated pathogens. Infection can also alter the development of leuke mia, mammary tumors, or carcinogen-induced liver tumors.\n\nSarcocystis muris has a life cycle similar to that of Toxoplasma gondii and is considered extremely rare or nonexistent in mice produced and housed in modern colonies.\n\nKlossiella muris is a renal coccidian of wild and laboratory mice. Mice are infected by ingestion of sporulated sporocysts. Sporozoites released from the sporocysts enter the bloodstream and are disseminated through the body. Sporozoites enter endothelial cells lining renal arterioles and glomerular capillaries where schizogony occurs. Mature schizonts rupture into Bow man's capsule to release merozoites into the lumen of renal tubules. Merozoites can enter epithelial cells lining convoluted tubules where the sexual phase of the life cycle is completed. Sporocysts form in renal tubular epithelium and eventually rupture host cells and are excreted in the urine, but oocysts are not formed. Klosiella muris infection is usually nonpathogenic and asymptomatic. Gray spots may occur in heavily affected kidneys and reflect necrosis, granulomatous inflammation, and focal hyperplasia. Destruction of tubular epithelium may im pair renal physiology.\n\nDiagnosis is based on detection of organisms in tissues. Pre vention and control rest on proper sanitation and management techniques. No known treatment is effective.\n\nEncephalitizoon cuniculi is a gram-positive microsporidian that is frequently found in tissues of mammals, including rab bits, mice, rats, guinea pigs, dogs, nonhuman primates, and humans. The life cycle is direct, and animals are infected by ingesting spores or by cannibalism. Organisms proliferate in peritoneal macrophages by asexual binary fission. They have a capsule that accepts Giemsa and Goodpasture's stain but is poorly stained by hematoxylin. Spore cells are disseminated in the blood to the brain and other sites. Infection can last more than 1 year, and spores shed in the urine serve as a source of infection. Vertical transmission has not been confirmed in mice. Encephalitizoon cuniculi is an obligate intracellular par asite but usually elicits no clinical signs of disease. Fulminat ing infection can, however, cause lymphocytic meningoencephalitis and focal granulomatous hepatitis. In contrast to encephalitozoonosis of rabbits, affected mice do not develop interstitial nephritis.\n\nEncephalitizoon cuniculi is diagnosed by cytological exam ination of ascitic fluid smears, by histopathological examina tion of brain tissues stained with Goodpasture's stain, and by various skin tests and serological methods including immunofluorescence, immunoperoxidase, immuno-India ink, com plement fixation, and microagglutination. No effective treat ment has been reported. Prevention and control rest on rigid testing and elimination of infected colonies and cell lines.\n\nPneumocystic carinii is a ubiquitous opportunistic organism that is present as a latent infection in many species, including rats and mice. It is normally not pathogenic but can be acti vated by intercurrent immunosuppression and fills the lung with trophozoites, precysts, cysts, and intracystic bodies. Nat urally occurring P. carinii infection has, for example, been detected in mice treated with corticosteroids or a low protein diet and spontaneous pneumocystosis has been reported in athymic mice.\n\nInfection is diagnosed by histological examination of lung sections stained by hematoxylin and eosin and by methanamine silver. Activation of lesions usually requires pretreat ment with corticosteroid. Serological tests, such as CF and immunofluorescence, also have been used for diagnosis.\n\nSulfadiazine/pyrimethamine combinations have been used to treat P. carinii infection. Because this regimen may arrest granulocyte maturation in the bone marrow through inter ference with folic and folinic acid biosynthesis, a folinic acid supplement should be added to the treatment regimen. Pneu mocystosis control is based on rederivation of colonies and the selection of uninfected animals as breeders.\n\nb. Noninvasive Protozoal Infections (see review by Hsu, 1982) Giardia muris, a pear-shaped bilaterally symmetrical orga nism, resides in the upper small intestine of mice, rats, and hamsters. Giardia muris replicates in the lumen and adheres to microvilli of columnar crypt cells but does not cause signifi cant enteritis. Nevertheless, heavily infected mice can have weight loss, rough haircoat, sluggish movement, and dis tended abdomens. Diarrhea is not common, but the small in testines may contain yellow or white watery fluid. C3H/He mice are particularly susceptible to giardiasis, whereas BALB/c mice are more resistant. Athymic mice may die dur ing heavy infestation.\n\nDiagnosis is based on detection of trophozoites in the small intestine or ellipsoidal cysts with four nuclei in the feces or on histological identification of the parasite in tissue sections. Or ganisms can be recognized in wet preparations by their charac teristic rolling and tumbling movements. Murine giardiasis can be treated by the addition of 0.1% dimetridazole to drink ing water for 14 days. Chlorocrine, quinacrine, and amodiaquin also are effective. Prevention and control depend on prop er sanitation and management including adequate disinfection of contaminated rooms.\n\nSpironucleus muris is a common flagellated protozoan of the small intestine of mice, rats, and hamsters, where it usually inhabits the crypts of Lieberkuhn (Fig. 32) . Spironucleus muris is elongated, pear-shaped, and bilaterally symmetrical. It is more pathogenic for young, stressed, or immunocompromised animals than for adult animals, and the former group may develop chronic infection. Infected mice can have a poor haircoat, sluggish behavior, and weight loss. Dehydration, hunched posture, abdominal distension, and diarrhea can occur in young mice, and there may be some deaths. Infection has been associated with duodenitis, but it is not clear whether this lesion is a primary pathogenic effect of S. muris or if it repre sents opportunism secondary to a primary bacterial or viral enteritis.\n\nThe diagnosis of spironucleosis is based on identification of trophozoites in the intestinal tract. They can be distinguished form G. muris and Tritrichomonas muris by their small size, horizontal or zigzag movements, and the absence of a sucking disk or undulating membrane. Treatment consists of adding 0.1% dimetridazole in drinking water for 14 days as described for Giardia. Prevention and control require good husbandry and sanitation.\n\nInfected mice may have enlarged lymph nodes with activated macrophages that kill tumor cells nonspecifically. Some work ers believe that S. muris-infected mice are unsuitable for immunological studies because infection is associated with di minished responses to soluble and particulate antigens. Infected mice also have increased sensitivity to irradiation and increased mortality from cadmium exposure. These effects should, however, be interpreted cautiously to rule out intercur rent viral infection.\n\nTritrichomonas muris is nonpathogenic and occurs in the cecum, colon, and small intestine of mice, rats, and hamsters. Cysts are not formed and transmission is by ingestion of trophozoites passed in the feces.\n\nEimeria falciformis is a pathogenic coccidian that occurs in epithelial cells of the large intestines of mice. It appears to be common in European mice but is seldom observed in the United States. Heavy infection may cause diarrhea and catarrhal enteritis.\n\nCryptosporidium muris is a sporozoan that adheres to the surface of the epithelium of the mouse stomach. It is uncom mon in laboratory mice and is only slightly pathogenic. Cryptosporidium parvum inhabits the small intestine, but it also is nonpathogenic and uncommon in laboratory mice.\n\nEntamoeba muris is found in the cecum and colon of mice, rats, and hamsters throughout the world. Organisms live in the lumen where they feed on particles of food and bacteria. They are considered nonpathogenic.\n\nc. Helminth Infections (see review by Wescott, 1982) Syphacia obvelata, the common mouse pin worm, is a ubiq uitous parasite of wild and laboratory mice. It often occurs in combination with Aspicularis tetraptera. The rat, gerbil, and hamster are occasionally infected.\n\nFemale worms range from 3.4 to 5.8 mm in length, and male worms are smaller (1.1-1.5 mm). Eggs are flattened on one side and have pointed ends (Fig. 33) . The nucleus fills the shell and is frequently at a larval stage when eggs are laid. The life cycle is direct and is completed in 11-15 days. Females depos it their eggs on the skin and hairs of the perianal region. In gested eggs liberate larvae in the small intestine, and they mi grate to the cecum within 24 hr. Worms remain in the cecum for 10-11 days where they mature and mate. The females then migrate to the large intestine to deposit their eggs as they leave the host. There is unconfirmed speculation that larvae may reenter the rectum.\n\nInfection usually begins in young mice and can recur, but adult mice tend to be more resistant. Because the life cycle of S. obvelata is much shorter than that of Aspicularis tetraptera, the number of animals that are apt to be infected with S. obvelata is correspondingly greater.\n\nInfection is usually asymptomatic, and gross lesions are not prevalent aside from the presence of adults in the lumen of the intestine. Heavily infected mice can occasionally sustain vari ous intestinal lesions including rectal prolapse, intussuscep tion, enteritis, and fecal impaction.\n\nInfestation is diagnosed by demonstrating eggs in the perianal area or adult worms in the cecum or large intestine. Since most eggs are deposited outside the gastrointestinal tract, fecal examination is not reliable. Eggs are usually detected by press ing cellophane tape to the perineal area and then to a glass slide that is examined by microscopy. Aspicularis tetraptera ova are not ordinarily found in tape preparations and are easily differ- Fig. 33 . Eggs of (a) Syphacia obvelata, (b) Aspiculuris tetraptera, and (c) Hymenolepis nana. (From Wescott, 1982.) entiated from eggs of S. obvelata (see below). Adult worms can be found in cecal or colonie contents diluted in a petri dish of warm tap water. They are readily observed with the naked eye or with a dissecting microscope. Four-to 5-week-old mice should be examined because the prevalence is higher in this age group than in older mice.\n\nPinworm infestation can be treated effectively by adding piperazine citrate at 200-400 mg/kg to drinking water for 1 week followed by no treatment for a week and retreatment for a third week. High efficacy also has been reported for pyrivinium pamoate, stilbazium iodide, phosphate anthelminthics, mebendazole, trichlorphon, newer piperazines, thiabendazole, or dichlorvos.\n\nPrevention of reinfection requires strict isolation because Syphacia eggs become infective as soon as 6 hr after they are laid and survive for weeks even in dry conditions. Strict sanita tion, sterilization of feed and bedding, and periodic antihelminthic treatment are required to control infection. The use of filter bonnets can also reduce the spread of infective eggs. Aspicularis tetraptera is the other major oxyurid of the mouse and may coinfect mice carrying S. obvelata. Females are 2.6-4.7 mm long and males are slightly smaller. The life cycle is direct and takes approximately 23 to 25 days. Mature females inhabit the large intestine where they survive from 45 to 50 days and lay their eggs. The eggs are laid at night and leave the host in a mucous layer of fecal pellets. They require 6-7 days at 24\u00b0C to become infective and can survive for weeks outside the host. Ingested eggs hatch and larvae reach the middle colon where they enter crypts and remain for 4 to 5 days. They move to the proximal colon about 3 weeks after infection of the host. Since the life cycle is 10-12 days longer than S. obvelata, infections appear in somewhat older mice; heaviest infestation is expected at 5-6 weeks and can produce signs similar to those discussed for S. obvelata. Light to mod erate loads do not produce clinical disease.\n\nAspicularis tetraptera eggs can be detected in the feces and adult worms are found in the large intestine. Eggs are not de posited in the perianal area, therefore cellophane tape tech niques are not useful.\n\nMeasures for treatment and control are similar to those de scribed for S. obvelata. Since A. tetraptera takes longer to mature and since eggs are deposited in feces rather than on the host, adult parasites are more amenable to treatment by fre quent cage rotations. Immune expulsion of parasites and re sistance to reinfection is a hallmark of A. tetraptera infesta tion.\n\nHymenolepis nana, the dwarf tapeworm, can be a common cestode of mouse, rat and man. Infection rates, as with most parasitic infections, depend on the quality of husbandry. Adults are extremely small (25-40 mm) and have eggs with prominent polar filaments and rostellar hooks. The life cycle may be direct or indirect. The indirect cycle utilizes arthropods as intermediate hosts. Liberated oncospheres penetrate intesti nal villi and develop into a cercocystis stage before reemerging into the intestinal lumen 10 to 12 days later. The scolex at taches to the intestinal mucosa where the worm grows to adult size in 2 weeks. The cycle from ingestion to patency takes 20 to 30 days.\n\nYoung adult mice are most frequently infected. Signs and lesions include weight loss and focal enteritis, but clinical dis ease is rare unless infestation is severe.\n\nHymenolepis nana can be diagnosed by demonstrating eggs in fecal flotation preparations (Fig. 33 ) or by finding adult worms in the small intestine. Adult worms can be found by opening the intestine in petri dishes containing warm tap water. Hymenolepis nana can be differentiated from another species of rodent tapeworm, H. diminuta, by the fact that H. nana has rostellar hooks and eggs with polar filaments, where as H. diminuta has an unarmed rostellum.\n\nTreatment is usually successful because eggs do not survive well outside the host and because the prevalence of infection is low in caged mice kept in sanitary facilities. Drugs recom mended for treatment include quinacrine hypochloride, bunaminidine, niclosamide, and thiabendazole. Newer benzimidazoles have excellent activity against cestodes and nematodes, but they have not been tested in mice. Therefore, the present treatment of choice is bunaminidine at 1000 ppm administered for 18 days in the diet. Because H. nana can infect humans, proper precautions should be taken to avoid oral contamination during handling of rodents.\n\nSeveral helminths infect mice occasionally, but they are not important agents in well-managed colonies. Syphacia muris is the common rat pinworm. It can be differentiated from S. obvelata because S. obvelata eggs are larger. Treatment is the same as for pinworms of mice. Hymenolepis microstoma is found in the bile ducts of rodents and could be confused with H. nana in the mouse. However, the location of the adult as well as the large size of the eggs compared to H. nana make differential diagnosis relatively simple. The mouse and the rat are intermediate hosts of the cestode Taenia taeniaformis; the definitive host is the cat. This parasite should not be found in laboratory mice housed separately from cats. A summary of more exotic parasites of the mouse is found in the ACLAM text \"The Mouse in Biomedicai Research\" (Wescott, 1982) .\n\nd. Ectoparasitism (see review by Weisbroth, 1982) The important ectoparasites of mice spend their lives on the host. Populations are limited by factors such as self-grooming, mutual grooming, the presence of hair (which is required for acariasis), and immunological responses, which tend to pro duce hypersensitivity to mites. Inherited resistance and suscep tibility also affect clinical expression of acariasis. Mite popula tions, for example, vary widely among different stocks and strains of mice housed under similar conditions. Lice and mites generally favor the dorsal anterior regions of the body, particularly the top of the head, neck, and withers (areas least amenable to grooming), but in severe parasitism, all areas of skin can be infested. Skin lesions of acariasis and pediculosis include pruritis, scruffiness, and patchy hair loss, and in severe cases, ulc\u00e9ration and pyoderma initiated or com pounded by self-inflicted trauma. Histologically, hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and chronic dermatitis may occur. Long standing infestation provokes chronic inflammation, fibrosis and proliferation of granulation tissue. Ulcerative dermatitis associated with acariasis may have an allergic pathogenesis. Lesions resemble allergic acariasis in other species and are as sociated with mast cell accumulations. Some workers believe chronic mite infestation contributes to secondary amyloidosis.\n\nPolyplax serrata (mouse louse) has five primary stages in its life cycle, which include the egg, three nymphal stages, and the adult (Fig. 34) . Eggs attach near the base of hair shafts. They hatch in 5-6 days, and nymphs develop into adults in 7 days giving an average life cycle of about 13 days. Transmis sion is by direct contact. They are blood-sucking lice, thus clinical signs of heavy infestation are related to dermatitis, anemia, and debilitation and can occasionally be fatal. Lice should not be found, however, in well-managed colonies. Le sions associated with infestation include acanthosis and hyperkeratosis and allergic dermatitis. The role of immunological reactions in the pathogenesis and control of infection has, how ever, not been well-defined. These parasites can also transmit Eperythrozoon coccoides (see page 53).\n\nMyobia musculi (mouse mite) has a world-wide distribution in laboratory mice. It can be differentiated from Radfordia, another common mouse mite, in that Myobia has an empodial claw on the second pair of legs whereas Radfordia has two terminal claws on the terminal tarsal structure of leg 2 (Fig.  35) . The life cycle can be completed in 23 days and includes an egg stage, first and second larval stage, protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. Eggs attach at the base of hair shafts and hatch in 7-8 days. Larval forms last about 10 days followed by nymphal forms on day 11. Adults appear by day 15 and lay eggs within 24 hr.\n\nMyobia probably feed on skin secretions and are transmitted primarily by contact. With new infestations, mite populations increase followed by a decrease to equilibrium in 8-10 weeks. The equilibrium population can be carried for long periods, even years. Fluctuations in equilibrium populations may repre sent waves of egg hatchings. Because mites are thermotactic, they crawl to the end of hair shafts on dead hosts where they may live for up to 4 days. Treatment should account for the fact that acaracides are ineffective for eggs. Therefore, a sec ond application should be made after the eighth day when re sidual eggs have hatched but sometime before the sixteenth day when new adults may have laid their eggs. Ideally, the second treatment should be given between the tenth and twelfth day (see page 80).\n\nRadfordia affinis (mouse mite) is a ubiquitous mite that is similar in appearance to M. musculi. The life cycle and pathogenesis of Radfordia infection have not been described.\n\nMyocoptes musculinus (mouse mite) (Fig. 36) is the most common ectoparasite of the laboratory mouse but frequently occurs in conjunction with Myobia musculi. Its distribution is worldwide. The life cycle includes egg, larva, protonymph, tridonymph, and adult stages. Eggs hatch in 5 days and are usually attached to the middle third of the hair shaft. The life cycle has been reported as 14 days by one author and 8 days by another. Transmission requires direct contact, since mice sepa rated by wire screens do not contract infections from infected hosts. Bedding does not seem to serve as a vector. Neonates may be infected within 4-5 days of birth, and parasites may live for 8-9 days on dead hosts.\n\nMyocoptes appears to inhabit larger areas of the body than Myobia. It has some predelection for skin of the inguinal re gion, abdominal skin, and back, but it will also infest the head and neck. In heavy infestations, it tends to crowd out Myobia. It is a surface dweller that feeds on superficial epidermis. In festation can cause patchy thinning of the hair, alopecia, or erythema. Lesions can be pruritic, but ulc\u00e9ration has not been reported. Chronic infestations induce epidermal hyperplasia and nonsuppurative dermatitis. Detailed pathogenetic studies have not been made.\n\nP sorer gates simplex (mouse mite) inhabits hair follicles. The life cycle is unknown, but developmental stages from egg to adult may be found in a single dermal nodule. Transmission is by direct contact. Infestation was common in laboratory mice 30 years ago but is now considered rare. It has not been re ported as a naturally occurring infection in well-managed colo nies for at least a decade.\n\nPsorergates simplex invades the hair follicle and a cystlike nodule develops. Dermal cysts appear as small white nodules in the subcutis (Fig. 37) . Histologically, they are invaginated sacs of squamous epithelium, excretory products, and keratinaceous debris. There is usually no inflammatory reaction, but healing may be accompanied by granulomatous inflamma tion. Diagnosis is made by examining the subcutis surface of the pelt grossly or by histological examination. Pouch contents also can be expressed by pressure with a scalpel blade or scraped and mounted for microscopic examination.\n\nTrichoecius romboutsi has been reported in mice in the United States and Europe but infestation is believed to be rare. Its life cycle and pathogenesis are unknown.\n\nOther acarid ectoparasites and others seen infrequently in laboratory mice (e.g., fleas and bedbugs) are shown in Table  XL Gross observation of live, unrestrained mice may not detect ectoparasitism accurately. Therefore supplementary diagnostic tests are useful and the following techniques are suggested: 1. Direct observation of the hair and skin of dead or anesthe tized mice. Hairs are parted with pins or sticks and examined with a dissecting microscope.\n\n2. Cellophane tape is pressed against areas of the pelt of freshly euthanatized mice and examined microscopically. Al ternatively, recently euthanatized mice can be placed on a black paper and double-sided cellophane tape can be used to line the perimeter to contain the parasites from leaving. As the carcass cools, parasites will vacate the pelage and crawl onto the paper. Sealed petri dishes can also be used.\n\n3. Skin scrapings made with a scapel blade can be mace rated in 10% KOH glycerine or immersion oil and examined microscopically. This method has the disadvantage of missing quickly moving species and low-level populations of slower moving forms. Demodex, Sarcoptes, and Notoedres, species for which scrapings are most useful, are not reported for the laboratory mouse {Mus musculus).\n\nEradication of ectoparasitism is costly and rarely completely effective. In fact, the only effective way to eliminate infesta tion is by gnotobiotic rederivation. Therefore, once infestation has been diagnosed, periodic control is a more pragmatic goal.\n\nTreatment and control programs should be carried out on a colony-wide basis. A summary of published control programs for ectoparasites of laboratory mice is given in Table XII . Each has advantages and disadvantages. Dusts either as desiccating sorptives or insecticides have generally given poor results be cause of toxicity, high labor costs, and variable efficacy. Dips such as malathion also result in variable efficacy and in tox icity. Aramite has been widely used as a dip in the United States and with generally good results but its use is labor intensive.\n\nDichlorvos, an organophosphate, has received widespread use against mites. It is effective and labor saving. Cage treat ments can include taping of resin strips inside filter bonets, or addition of 2 gm of tablets or 2 ml of liquid concentrate per cage. Dichlorvos has not been used specifically against Polyplax but is effective against avian lice, which suggests it may also be useful for rodent lice. It causes transient lowering of serum acetylcholinesterase, but it is rapidly cleared and metab olized. It is neither teratogenic nor carcinogenic, but it may delay breeding transiently during extensive exposures. \n\nTrichophyton mentagrophytes is the major cause of ring worm in mice. It may cause clinical disease, but it is more commonly present in the skin of mice as an asymptomatic in fection. Clinical signs include sparse haircoats or well demar cated crusty lesions with a chalky surface. Microsporum infec tions of mice are not well documented. The diagnosis of ringworm depends on effective specimen collection. Hairs should be selected from the periphery of the lesion. Hairless skin should be scraped deeply to obtain diagnostic specimens. Trichophyton mentagrophytes rarely fluoresces under ultravio let light, and hyphi must be differentiated from bedding fibers, food particles and epidermal debris. Trichophyton can be cultured on Saboraud's agar. Plates are incubated at room tem perature (22\u00b0-30\u00b0C) and growth is observed at 5-10 days. The zoonotic potential of ringworm is discussed in Chapter 22 by Fox et al.\n\nRingworm is not easily eradicated from laboratory mice. It may be necessary to destroy affected mice and sterilize all cages and equipment before reuse. Concurrent infection with ectoparasites also must be considered. The use of griseofulvin 81 in mice must be approached with caution because of metabolic differences between these animals and dogs and cats where this drug is often used. It should not be used in breeding females since it is potentially embryotoxic and teratogenic. Dip solu tions should be kept at 37\u00b0C, and animals should be allowed to dry in a warm environment.\n\nPathogenic fungi such as Candida albicans are not an impor tant cause of gastrointestinal lesions in the mouse, but they can be opportunistic pathogens in immunodeficient mice. Fungal infections of other organ systems are extremely rare.\n\nFur mans ki and Rich, 1982) Neoplasms of lymphoid and hematopoietic tissues are esti mated to have a spontaneous prevalence of 1-2%. There are, however, some strains of mice that have been specifically in bred and selected for susceptibility to spontaneous tumors. Leukemogenesis in mice may involve viruses and chemical or physical agents. Viruses associated with lymphopoietic and hematopoietic neoplasia belong to the family Retroviridae Fig. 37 . P sore gates s/rapfex-infested skin inverted to show pouches (ar row). From Weisbroth (1982) . (Photograph courtesy of Dr. R. J. Flynn and Laboratory Animal Science.) (type C oncornaviruses) and contain RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase). These viruses are generally noncytopathogenic for infected cells, and mice appear to har bor them as normal components of their genetic apparatus. Al though they may be involved in spontaneous leukemia, they are not consistently expressed in this disease. Recombinant vi ruses have recently been discovered that can infect mouse cells and heterologous cells and are associated with spontaneous leukemia development in high leukemia strains such as AKR mice. Their phenotypic expression is controlled by mouse gen otype. Endogenous retroviruses are transmitted vertically through the germ line. Horizontal transmission is inefficient but can occur by interuterine infection or through saliva, sputum, urine, feces, or milk. The leukemia induced by a given endogenous virus is usually of a single histopathological type.\n\nChemical carcinogens, such as polycyclic hydrocarbons, nitrosoureas, and nitrosamines, can also induce hematological malignancies in mice. Physical agents such as X irradiation are also effective inducers of cancer.\n\nThe most common hematopoietic malignancy in the mouse is lymphocytic leukemia that originates in the thymus. Disease begins with unilateral atrophy and then enlargement of one lobe of thymus as tumor cells proliferate. Cells can spread to the other lobe and then to other hematopoietic organs, such as the spleen, bone marrow, liver, and peripheral l>mph nodes. Clinical signs include dyspnea and protrusion of the eyeballs. The latter sign is due to compression of venous blood returning from the head. Tumor cells spill into the circulation late in disease. Most of these tumors originate from T lymphocytes, but there are leukemias of B lymphocyte or null cell lineage. In the last two syndromes, the lymph nodes and spleen are often involved, but the thymus is generally normal, and each form can be induced in athymic mice.\n\nMyeloid leukemia is not common in mice, but it can be virus induced. Myeloblasts accumulate in the liver and in the cir culation and infiltrate bone marrow and other organs. Leukemic cells in various stages of differentiation can be found in peripheral blood. In older animals, affected organs may appear green due to myeloperoxidase activity giving rise to the term chloroleukemia. The green hue fades on contact with air.\n\nErythroleukemia is rare in mice. The major lesion is massive splenomegaly, which is accompanied by anemia and polycythemia. Hepatomegaly can follow, but there is little change in the thymus or lymph nodes.\n\nReticulum cell sarcomas are common in older mice, es pecially in inbred strains such as C57BL and SJL. Primary tumor cell types have been divided into several categories based on morphological features. Type A sarcomas typically involve the spleen and liver and are often accompanied by ascites. Type B tumors produce a Hodgkin's-like syndrome char acterized by mesenteric lymph node enlargement often involv ing Peyer's patches and spleen. A spontaneous reticulum cell sarcoma that occurs in more than 90% of inbred SJL/J mice begins in the mesenteric lymph nodes. This tumor can also affect other organs, such as the spleen, thymus, and liver.\n\nNatural plasma cell tumors are infrequent in the mouse. They can, however, be induced by intraperitoneal inoculation of granulomatogenic agents such as plastic filters, plastic shav ings, or a variety of oils.\n\nMast cell tumors are also very rare in mice. They are found almost exclusively in old mice and grow slowly. They should not be confused with mast cell hyperplasia observed in the skin following painting with carcinogens or X irradiation. Medina, 1982) Mammary tumors can be induced or modulated by a variety of factors, including viruses, chemical carcinogens, radiation, hormones, genetic background, diet, and immune status. Cer tain inbred strains of mice, such as C3H, A, and DBA/2, have a high natural prevalence of mammary tumors. Other strains, such as BALB/c, C57BL, and AKR, have a low prevalence.\n\nAmong the most important factors contributing to the devel opment of mammary tumors are mammary tumor viruses. Sev eral major variants are known. The primary tumor virus MMTV/S (Bittner virus) is highly oncogenic and is transmit- ted through the milk of nursing females. A summary of other virus strains is given in Table XIII . Infected mice typically develop a precursor lesion, the hyperplastic alveolar nodule, which can be serially transplanted.\n\nSpontaneous mammary tumors metastasize with high fre quency, but this property is somewhat mouse strain dependent. M\u00e9tastases go primarily to the lung. Some mammary tumors are hormone dependent, some are ovary dependent, and others are pregnancy dependent. Ovary-dependent tumors contain es trogen and progesterone receptors, whereas pregnancy-depen dent tumors have prolactin receptors. Ovariectomy will dra matically reduce the incidence of mammary tumors in C3H mice. If surgery is done in adult mice 2-5 months of age, mammary tumors will develop, but at a later age than normal.\n\nMammary tumors have been categorized morphologically into three major groups; carcinomas, carcinomas with squamous cell differentiation, and carcinosarcomas. The carcinomas are divided into adenocarinoma types A, B, C, Y, L, and P. Most tumors are type A or B. Type A consists of adenomas, tubular carcinomas, and alveolar carcinomas. Type B tumors have a variable pattern with both well-differentiated and poorly differentiated regions. They may consist of regular cords or sheets of cells or papillomatous areas. Type C tumors are rare and are characterized by multiple cysts lined by low cuboidal to squamous epithelial cells, and they have abundant stroma. Type Y tumors, which are also rare, are characterized by tubu lar branching of cuboidal epithelium and abundant stroma. Adenocarcinomas with a lace-like morphology (types L and P) are hormone dependent and have a branching tubular structure.\n\nThe control or prevention of mammary neoplasms depends on the fact that some strains of mammary tumor virus are trans mitted horizontally whereas others are transmitted vertically. Therefore, although one can rid mice of horizontally transmit ted virus such as MMTV-S by cesarean rederivation or by fos ter nursing, endogenous strains of tumor virus may remain. Fortunately, these latter tumor viruses have generally low oncogenicity compared to the Bittner virus.\n\nc. Liver (see review by Newberne and McConnell, 1982) Liver tumors can develop in mice exposed to environmental chemicals, many of which are carcinogenic or potentially car cinogenic. Almost all strains of mice have a significant preva lence of hepatic tumors, some of which appear to result from dietary contamination or deficiency. The prevalence of spon taneous liver tumors in B6C3Fj hybrids can, for example, be increased from between 5 and 58% up to 100% by feeding choline-deficient diets.\n\nSpontaneous liver tumors in mice are usually derived from hepatocytes, whereas cholangiocellular tumors are rare. The morphological characteristics of each of these stages have been described in detail. Hepatocellular carcinoma is an end-stage lesion and generally displays local invasiveness or metastasis. It can have a variety of histopathological patterns ranging from medullary to trabecular. Although proliferative lesions of the mouse liver have been described morphologically, their bio logical behavior and their relationship to one another are not clearly understood. One prevalent view is that tumorigenesis proceeds from foci of altered cells to hyperplastic nodules to adenomas to hepatocellular carcinomas. Theiss and Shimkin, 1982) Primary respiratory tumors of mice occur in relatively high frequency and are largely of alveologenic origin. It has been estimated that more than 95% of these tumors are pulmonary Medina (1982) . ^Hormone responsiveness refers to the general hormonal requirements for growth of palpable mammary tumors.\n\nadenomas that arise either from type 2 pneumocytes or from Clara cells lining terminal bronchioles. Pulmonary adenomas usually appear as distinct whitish nodules that are easily de tected by examination of the lung surface. (Clara cell tumors commonly protrude into bronchioles.) Malignant alveologenic tumors are infrequent and consist of adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. They invade pulmonary par enchyma and are prone to metastasize. The prevalence of spontaneous respiratory tumors is mouse strain dependent. For example, by 2 years of age, lung tumors have been found in more than 70% of A strain mice but in less than 10% of C57BL mice. The number of tumors per lung is also higher in susceptible mice.\n\nLung tumors can be induced by a variety of chemical car cinogens, but, in contrast to mammary tumors, the incidence of respiratory tumors does not seem to be influenced by steroid hormones.\n\nNeoplasms of other organ systems are less prevalent. They are reviewed in Volume IV of 'The Mouse in Biomedicai Re search\" (Foster et al., 1982b) .\n\nThe prevalence of noninfectious diseases is influenced by genetic, nutritional, environmental, age-related, and sex-relat ed factors. Many of these diseases appear with increasing fre quency as animals age.\n\nAge-associated lesions are common in the livers of mice. Cellular and nuclear pleomorphism, including binucleated and multinucleated cells, are detectable by 6 months. Mild focal necrosis occurs with or without inflammation, but an associa tion of mild focal hepatitis with a specific infectious disease is often hard to confirm. Other geriatric hepatic lesions include biliary hyperplasia with varying degrees of portal hepatitis, hepatocellular vacuolization, amyloid deposition especially in periportal areas, strangulated or herniated lobes, hemosiderosis, lipofuscinosis, and fibrosis. Extramedullary hematopoiesis occurs in young mice and in response to anemia.\n\nAbscesses or necrosis may occur in the lips or oral cavity because of fighting injury or mechanical trauma from cages. Overgrown incisor teeth can cause malocclusion, and caries can develop in molar teeth. Gastric lesions include crypt dilata tion, submucosal fibrosis, adenomatous gastric hyperplasia, mineralization, and erosion or ulc\u00e9ration. Gastric ulcers may be stress related, especially in mice with prolonged illness.\n\nDiffuse or segmental intestinal amyloidosis is common in some strains of mice, and the lamina propria may be greatly distended by accumulations of amyloid. Germfree mice may have lower muscle tone in the intestinal tract. Cecal volvulous is a common finding in germfree mice and is caused by rota tion of the large cecum.\n\nExocrine pancreatic insufficiency has been reported in CBA/J mice. Acinar cell atrophy is common but is strain and sex dependent.\n\nAtrial thrombosis appears to be strain related with a high prevalence in RFM mice. Dystrophie mineralization seen as pale focal or linear discolorations on the epicardium has been described in many strains of mice. A high incidence has been reported for DBA/2, BALB/c, and C3H strains, whereas C57BL/6 mice are essentially free of this lesion. The etiology is unknown. Peripheral vascular lesions are uncommon aside from mice with lupus-like disease where vasculitis and myocardial infarction can occur. Periarteritis appears in aged mice.\n\nParvovarian cysts are observed frequently and may be related to the fact that mouse ovaries are enclosed in membranous pouches. Amyloidosis is also common in the ovaries of old mice. Cystic endometrial hyperplasia may develop unilaterally or bilaterally and may be segmental. In some strains, the prev alence in mice older than 18 months is 100%. Endometrial hyperplasia is often associated with ovarian atrophy. Testicular atrophy, sperm granulomas, and tubular mineralization occur with varying incidence. Inflammation of accessory sex glands may occur, especially in males.\n\nGlomerulonephritis is one of the most common renal dis eases of mice. It is commonly associated with persistent viral infections or immune disorders rather than with bacterial infec tions. Its prevalence in some strains approaches 100%. The NZB mouse and the \u00a5 { hybrid of NZB x NZW crosses, for example, develop glomerulonephritis as an autoimmune dis ease resembling human lupus erythematosus, whereas glomerular disease is relatively mild in NZB mice (NZB mice have a high incidence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia) (see review by Talal, 1983) .\n\nRenal changes occur as early as 4 months of age but clinical signs and severe disease are not present until 6-9 months. The disease is associated with wasting and proteinurea, and lesions progress until death intervenes. Histologically, glomeruli have proteinaceous deposits in the capillaries and mesangium. Later, tubular atrophy and proteinaceous casts occur through out the kidney. Immunofluorescence studies show deposits of immunoglobulin and the third component of complement, which lodge as immune complexes with nuclear antigens and antigens of murine leukemia virus in glomerular capillary loops. Mice infected with LCMV or with retroviruses can also develop glomerulonephritis of immune complex origin.\n\nAscending pyelitis occurs in mice secondary to urinary tract infection. Amyloidosis in older mice is associated with papil lary necrosis, but amyloid deposition in glomeruli and in the renal interstitium is also common. Urethral obstruction in sec ondary hydronephrosis is seen especially in CDF, mice. Chronic progressive nephropathy is seen in varying incidence and appears to be an age-related lesion in mice as it is in the rat.\n\nAccessory adrenal cortical nodules are found in periadrenal and perirenal fat, especially in females. They have little func tional significance other than their potential effect on failures of surgical adrenalectomy. Lipofuscinosis and subcapsular spindle cell hyperplasia and cystic dilatation of cortical si nusoids are found in the adrenal cortices of old mice.\n\nSome inbred strains have deficiencies of thyrotropic hor mone resulting in thyroid atrophy. Thyroid cysts lined by strat ified squamous epithelium and generally of ultimobranchial or igin may be seen in old mice. Amyloid can be deposited in the thyroid and parathyroid glands as well as in the adrenal glands. Spontaneous diabetes mellitis-like disease has been reported in genetic variants of several strains (see Section III,C,o).\n\nSkin lesions can be caused by fighting, tail biting, and whis ker chewing. Fighting is not limited extensively to males, but they tend to be more aggressive. Bite wounds are usually lo cated on the head, neck, shoulders, peritoneal area, and tail. Often one animal per pen is free of lesions and is considered the aggressor or dominant animal. Removal of the unaffected male usually ends the fighting, and the wounded animals re cover. However, a previously submissive male may become dominant when an aggressive male is removed and fighting may resume. Fighting has some strain predilection, and is es pecially notorious among BALB/c males, but tail lesions re sembling bite wounds have been reported in other strains.\n\nHair nibbling or whisker chewing (barbering) is also a man ifestation of social dominance. Dominant animals retain whis kers, whereas cagemates have \"shaved faces\" (Fig. 12) . Chronic hair chewing can produce histological abnormalities such as poorly formed or pigmented club hairs. Once chewing has ceased, many mice regrow previous hair loss in several weeks. Both sexes may engage in this activity, and sometimes females may be dominant. Regional alopecia, especially around the muzzle, may result from abrasion against cage sur faces. Improperly diluted disinfectants may also cause regional hair loss. Metal tags used for animal identification may cause pruritis and self-induced trauma. Clipping prior to application of experimental compounds to the skin may cause pruritic re sponses and can augment lesions that interfere with test results. Dermatophytosis or ectoparasitism must be considered in the differential diagnoses for muzzle or body alopecia.\n\nHigh levels of estrogen in pregnancy may influence postpartum shedding. Various endocrine effects on hair growth have also been described. Spotty alopecia of unknown etiology may occur in some strains of mice such as C57BL/6. Abdominal and thoracic alopecia have been reported in B6C3F, mice.\n\nDystrophie mineralization of soft tissues occurs frequently in old mice, a high prevalence being reported in DBA/2 mice. It is found in the myocardium of the left ventricle, in the intraventricular systems, and in skeletal muscle, kidneys, arteries, and lung. It is associated with fibrosis and often with mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates. Diets high in calcium in crease the prevalence of this lesion. Age-associated os teoporosis or senile osteodystrophy can occur in some mice. It is not associated with severe renal disease or parathyroid hy perplasia. Nearly all strains of mice develop some form of osteoarthrosis. It is generally noninflammatory, affects articulat ing surfaces, and results in secondary bone degeneration.\n\nHyperplasia of alveolar or bronchial epithelium occurs in old mice and must be differentiated from pulmonary tumors.\n\nSymmetrical mineral deposits commonly occur in the thalamus of aged mice. They may also be found in the midbrain, cerebellum, and cerebrum and are particularly common in A/J mice. Lipofuscin accumulates in the neurons of old mice. Deposits of melanin pigment occur in heavily pigmented strains, especially in the frontal lobe. Age-associated pe ripheral neuropathy with demyelination can be found in the nerves of the hindlimbs in B6 mice. A number of neurologically mutant mice have been described. They commonly have correlative anatomical malformations or inborn errors of metabolism.\n\nAggregates or nodules of mononuclear cells are found in many tissues of aged mice, including the salivary gland, thy mus, ovary, uterus, mesentery and mediastinum, urinary blad der, and gastrointestinal tract. These nodules should not be mistaken for lymphosarcomas. The spleen is subject to amyloidosis and hemosiderin deposition. Lipofuscin deposi tion is common especially in older mice. The thymus under goes age-associated atrophy.\n\nCataracts can occur in old mice and have a higher prevalence in certain mutant strains. Inherited retinal degeneration is ob served in strains such as C3H and light-associated retinal de generation can occur, especially in nonpigmented mice.\n\nn. Nutritional Diseases (see review by Knapka, 1983) Dietary restriction increases the life span of mice and may retard development of renal disease and of tumors. Severe di etary protein deprivation, however, inhibits humoral and cellu lar immunity.\n\nChronic essential fatty acid deficiency may cause hair loss, dermatitis with scaling and crusting of the skin, and occasional diarrhea. Infertility has also been associated with this syn drome. Mice have an absolute requirement for a dietary source of linoleic and/or arachadonic acid.\n\nMineral deficiencies have only been described for several elements, and the consequences of the deficiencies are similar to those observed for other species. For example, iodine-defi cient diets produce thyroid goiters; magnesium-deficient diets may cause fatal convulsions; maganese deficiency may cause congenital ataxia from abnormal development of the inner ear, and zinc deficiency may cause hair loss on the shoulders and neck, emaciation and decreased liver and kidney catalase ac tivity, and immunosuppression.\n\nVitamin deficiencies in mice have not been thoroughly de scribed. Unfortunately, much of the information that does exist reflects work done 30-50 years ago, thus the reliability and specificity of some of these syndromes is questionable. Vitamin A deficiency may produce tremors, diarrhea, rough haircoat, keratitis, poor growth, abscesses, hemorrhages, and ster ility or abortion. Vitamin E deficiency can cause convulsions and heart failure as well as muscular dystrophy and hyaline degeneration of muscles. Deficiency of B complex vitamins produces nonspecific signs such as alopecia, decreased feed consumption, poor growth, poor reproduction, and lactation, as well as a variety of neurological abnormalities. Choline de ficiency produces fatty livers and nodular hepatic hyperplasia as well as myocardial lesions, decreased conception, and de creased viability of litters. Eolie odd-deficient diets cause marked decreases in red and white cell blood counts and the disappearance of megakaryocytes and nucleated cells from the spleen. Pantothenic acid deficiency is characterized by non specific signs, such as weight loss, alopecia, achromotrichia, and posterior paralysis as well as other neurological abnor malities. Thiamin deficiency is associated with neurological signs, such as violent convulsions, cartwheel movements, and decreased food consumption. Dietary requirements for ascorbic acid have not been shown in mice, and mouse diets are generally not fortified with ascorbic acid.\n\nMany spontaneous genetic abnormalities of mice have been exploited as animal models. Perhaps the most widely known of these is the athymic nude mouse that lacks a significant haircoat and more importantly, fails to develop a thymus and thus has a severe deficit of T cell-mediated immune function (see review by Rygaard and Polvsen, 1982) . Because of this defi cit, it is an excellent model to study the ontogeny and mecha nisms of immune responsiveness. Athymic mice also serve as in vivo carriers for allogeneic and xenogeneic cells, including human tumor cells.\n\nMutations in ophthalmologic development, anatomy, and physiology have been described for mice (see review by Robison et ai, 1982) . Albino mice are particularly sensitive to in tense light and are susceptible to a light-accelerated retinal de generation. Mice also display inherited convulsive disorders, including audiogenic seizures that have been advanced as ani mal models for human epilepsy.\n\nMouse mutations for obesity have been described, and di abetes is inherited as an autosomal recessive mutation in a substrain of C57BL mice (see review by Coleman, 1982) . A re cessive gene for obesity is also maintained in the C57BL strain. Some strains of mice are deficient in the C5 fraction of complement (A/Jax and B10.D2/0).\n\nEnvironmental variables can affect responses of mice in ex perimental situations. Changes in respiratory epithelial phys iology and function from elevated levels of ammonia, effects of temperature and humidity on metabolism, effects of light on eye lesions and retinal function, and effects of noise on neurophysiology are examples of complications that can vary with the form of insult and the strain of mouse employed. Chlo roform has extreme nephrotoxicity for male mice but not for female mice of certain strains (see Chapter 23)."}
