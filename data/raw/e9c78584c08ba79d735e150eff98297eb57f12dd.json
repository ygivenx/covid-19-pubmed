{"title": "", "body": "shows the phylogeny reconstructed using the neighboring-joining method with mid-point rooting. One striking feature is that GZ01 was distantly separated from other sequences. All the sequences from mainland China (GZ01 and BJ01-04) clustered together and separated from the remaining sequences. Interestingly, CUHK-W1 shared some common variants with those from mainland China, suggesting multiple sources of SARS-CoV in Hong Kong. A maximum parsimony tree was similar to that in Figure S1 .\n\nThe phylogeny in Figure replicates."}
