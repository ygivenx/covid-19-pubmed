{"title": "Exit and Entry Screening Practices for Infectious Diseases among Travelers at Points of Entry: Looking for Evidence on Public Health Impact", "body": "Public health events can cause serious crises and damage to the human population if effective frameworks and systems are not in place to prevent, early detect, and respond in a timely manner to health threats. In recent years, events such as the Public Health Emergencies of International Concern of Zika Virus Disease declared in 2016 and Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak declared in 2014 affected or have/had the potential to seriously affect a large amount of the population. High mobility of populations across borders of countries can contribute to the rapid spread of diseases. Screening measures on travelers at points of entry including airports, ports, and ground crossings can be implemented to prevent international transmission of disease by detecting and prohibiting travel to exposed or ill travelers from affected areas [1,2]. \n\nThe International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005 states in articles 5, 13, 18, 19, and Annex 1B that World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations in response to a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) may include screening measures at points of entry. Moreover, WHO State Parties must have the capacities to apply entry or exit controls for arriving and departing travelers [3]. Decision 1082/2013/European Union (EU) of the European Parliament and of the Council on serious cross-border threats to health requires that \u201cMember States and the European Commission shall consult each other within the Health Security Committee (HSC)\u2026That consultation shall be aimed at \u201c\u2026supporting the implementation of core capacity requirements for surveillance and response as referred to in Articles 5 and 13 of the IHR\u201d [4], including capacities in implementing screening measures at borders. \n\nSince the entry of IHR 2005 into force, the WHO Director General has declared five PHEIC according to Article 12: in 2009 the Influenza Pandemic (H1N1), in 2014 the Poliovirus situation worldwide, in 2014 and 2019 the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo respectively, and in 2016 the Zika virus disease [5]. Moreover, in 2003 the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak alerted the global community. Temporary recommendations about exit screening in affected countries have been issued by WHO and applied in those countries. Other countries have implemented entry screening measures on travelers arriving from affected countries at ports, airports, and ground crossings, in response to PHEIC or as part of the routine measures to prevent disease introduction to their country [6,7,8,9,10,11]. \n\nAs has been described in WHO technical guidance during past public health events, entry or exit screening measures are generally conducted as a two-step process: primary screening and secondary screening [1,2]. With the primary screening, an initial assessment is carried out by personnel, who may not necessarily have public health or medical training. Activities include visual observation of travelers for signs of the infectious disease, measurement of travelers\u2019 body temperature, and completion of a questionnaire by travelers asking for presence of symptoms and/or exposure to the infectious agent. Travelers who have signs or symptoms of the infectious disease, or have been potentially exposed to the infectious agent, are referred to secondary screening. Secondary screening should be carried out by personnel with public health or medical training. It includes an in-depth interview, a focused medical and laboratory examination and second temperature measurement [1,12]. Specific objectives of entry or exit screening measures can include: identification of ill travelers who may have signs and symptoms, and of travelers who may have been exposed to a hazard and their close contacts; identification of appropriate public health measures, such as treatment, isolation, quarantine and travel restrictions that are commensurate with the risks and do not unduly interfere with international travel; proper collection of information and reporting of public health risks; provision of information and education to the traveling public about health risks. \n\nScreening measures can be implemented for long-time periods for specific diseases as part of the country\u2019s routine measures to prevent introduction of diseases to the country, or ad hoc after emergent public health events. Moreover, screening measures could be implemented massively to all inbound or outbound travelers at a point of entry, or targeted to specific travel routes (e.g., departing from an affected area) or to specific travelers (e.g., who have been in an affected area). \n\nPrevious attempts to assess the effectiveness of entry and exit screening measures have demonstrated either limited public health impact of such measures [9,13,14], or evidence of success [15] and benefits [6,16]. In the recent published literature, there is a lack of a systematic approach in appraising the evidence for usefulness of screening measures that could help countries in their decision-making on implementing health measures and allocating resources. \n\nThis paper describes the results of a scoping search and of a systematic bibliographic review aiming at giving insight on entry and exit screening referring to travelers at points of entry worldwide, with an emphasis among EU/European Economic Area (EEA) Member States (MS). Evidence from this study was used to inform EU MS in the framework of a training course conducted in 2019 about entry/exit screening structures and processes currently in place in EU MS and worldwide, as well as the strengths, limitations and lessons learnt from applying entry/exit screening at points of entry. Decision-making issues on implementing health measures that are commensurate with the risk, avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade, and considering business continuity plans are also discussed. Finally, the review explores preparedness issues and the capacities that must be in place at points of entry to implement entry/exit screening for infectious diseases. \n\nThe scoping search was conducted to answer the following research questions: \n\n(1) \u201cWhat are the practices, guidelines and experiences worldwide on entry and exit screening for infectious diseases to travelers at points of entry that have been published in the past 15 years?\u201d\n\n(2) \u201cWhat are the effects, the benefits and the limitations of entry and exit screening measures for infectious diseases to travelers at points of entry that have been published in the past 15 years?\u201d\n\nGrey literature, PubMed and Scopus were searched for relevant documents published in the past 15 years using the following search terms: (exit screening OR entry screening OR border measure) AND (patient OR ill OR sick OR infected OR affected OR exposed OR symptomatic) AND (human OR passenger OR traveler OR traveler OR crew) AND (airport OR aerodrome OR airdrome OR seaport OR port OR point of entry OR port of entry). \n\nThe scoping search was conducted independently of the systematic bibliographic review, which has been presented in the last paragraph of the first chapter. \n\nInclusion criteria were: articles or reports or other documents published in peer-reviewed journals or national and international organizations\u2019 publications, from 2003 until May 2018 that report practices, implementation of guidelines, experiences, structures, processes, evaluation results about national routine or ad hoc entry or exit screening activities referring to travelers at ports or airports or ground crossings, worldwide, performed during serious cross-border health events.\n\nArticles that refer to (a) migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers were excluded, except when related to response to a global health emergency, (b) screening of diseases that were not part of a global health emergency response, (c) entry or exit screening measures that were part of response to a specific outbreak on board an airplane or a ship and not part of a country response to a global health threat.\n\nThe bibliographic review was conducted to answer the following research questions: \n\n(1) What are the public health impact and the cost-effectiveness of implementing entry or exit screening among travelers for infectious diseases at ports, airports, and ground crossings by using different assessment methods? \n\n(2) What are the good practices for implementing entry or exit screening among travelers for infectious diseases at ports, airports, and ground crossings? \n\nThe specific objectives of the bibliographic review were the following: \n\n(1) Objective 1\n\nTo identify practices and experiences on entry and exit screening referring to travelers worldwide by using the evidence found in the literature and reports published by competent authorities.\n\n(2) Objective 2\n\nTo identify the lessons learnt from entry and exit screening referring to travelers at points of entry worldwide by using the evidence found in the literature and reports published by competent authorities or international organizations. \n\n(3) Objective 3 \n\nTo critically appraise the evidence for the public health impact and/or cost-effectiveness of entry and exit screening measures implemented on a routine basis or ad hoc basis to travelers worldwide. \n\n(1) Search topic and concepts\n\nThe research topic concerns the public health impact, the cost-effectiveness and the practices and experiences for implementing entry or exit screening among travelers for infectious diseases at ports, airports, and ground crossings, by using different assessment methods. \n\nThe search concepts used for the above-mentioned topic are: (a) public health event: infectious diseases in humans, (b) type of measure: entry screening or exit screening, (c) population of interest: travelers (crew and passengers) crossing borders, (d) setting: points of entry: airport, port, ground crossing, (e) outcomes: cost-effectiveness, public health impact. \n\nFor the purposes of this bibliographic review, the following definitions have been used for \u201centry screening\u201d and \u201cexit screening\u201d terms: \n\n(a). \u201cEntry screening\u201d are the public health measures implemented at points of entry (ports, airports, ground crossings) on travelers (crew and passengers) arriving to a country, with the purpose to assess the exposure to a biological agent (bacterium, virus, parasite) and/or the presence of symptoms. Entry screening is part of the international and domestic policies of competent authorities to control disease spread and to minimize impact on travel and trade, which can be severely affected by absence of adequate measures or lack of capacity to implement these measures [17]. \n\n(b). \u201cExit screening\u201d are the public health measures implemented at points of entry (ports, airports, ground crossings) on travelers (crew and passengers) departing from a country, with the purpose to assess the exposure to a biological agent (bacterium, virus, parasite) and/or the presence of symptoms. Exit screening is part of the international and domestic policies of competent authorities to control disease spread and to minimize impact on travel and trade, which can be severely affected by absence of adequate measures or lack of capacity to implement these measures [17].\n\n(2) Search resources and terms\n\nPubMed and Scopus were searched to identify relevant publications in peer-reviewed journals. The search terms used are presented in Table 1.\n\nTo identify the relevant grey literature the following websites were searched: WHO (headquarters, regional offices), European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Public Health Agencies and Surveillance Centers of EU/EEA MS and non-EU EU/EEA countries and the following organizations: International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), International Air Transport Association (IATA), Collaborative Arrangement for the Prevention and Management of Public Health Events in Civil Aviation (CAPSCA), Airport Council International (ACI), Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), International Shipping Federation (ISF), International Union of Railways (UIC), Intergovernmental Organisation for International Carriage by Rail (OTIF), Organisation for Cooperation between Railways (OSJD), International Rail Transport Committee (CIT), European Rail Research Advisory Council (ERRAC). A detailed list of all websites searched is included in Appendix A (Table A1). In addition, the reference lists from the relevant articles (hand search) was conducted and the eligible articles that were identified were included in the study.\n\nMoreover, websites of WHO and of national public health institutes were searched in order to identify publicly available surveillance data about the number of cases of the diseases targeted by the screening measures and reported during the period of entry/exit screening measure implementation in the country. These were used to make comparisons with the number of confirmed cases identified through the entry screening measures. \n\nAdditionally, the WHO website was searched to identify the temporary recommendations issued by WHO in response to the four above-mentioned PHEIC and recommended measures issued after other emergent public health events. Data from the WHO relevant reports were extracted about the timeframe of recommended screening measure implementation, the methods for screening, and the areas, as well as the advice for travel restrictions.\n\nTwo researchers checked the documents independently (titles, abstracts, full texts) for the eligibility criteria.\n\n(1) Inclusion and exclusion criteria\n\nThe inclusion and exclusion criteria used for the bibliographic review are presented in Table 2. Appendix B presents the questionnaire used to check documents for eligibility criteria. \n\n(1) Quality of articles appraisal \n\nThe quality of articles included in the review were assessed based on completing the inclusion criteria. \n\n(2) Data extraction \n\nSpecific questions were used by the two researchers to systematically extract the data from the articles, as shown in the questionnaire presented in Appendix C. Two researchers extracted independently data from the eligible articles. The following data were extracted from the papers/reports that fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the review: Type of screening (entry, exit)Types of infectious disease or diseases that entry and exit screening was targeting Type of points of entry: airports, ports, ground crossingsScreening carried out on a routine basis or on an ad hoc basis after a public health event has occurredMethods used in entry/exit screening (primary, secondary, questionnaire, body temperature, technology used etc.)Type of technology used (thermometers, scan cameras etc.)After screening, the applied diagnosis protocol (laboratory and clinical examination)Number of cases identified and the total numbers of travelers screenedPercentage of persons positive to screening finally diagnosed Percentage of persons diagnosed with a different disease from the initially targetedThe applied protocol for diagnosis and management of cases Health measures applied to the traveler and the environment General screening or targeted screening: outbound country, travelers directly arriving from affected countries, nationality, travelers in-transit Inter-sectorial collaboration and coordination processes Involved officers: public health officers, ministry officers, regional health system, national health system, NGOs, elseConcrete example of entry/exit screening Practices, experiences, and lessons learnt reportedChallenges reported (limitations, failures, mishaps)Bad practices reportedMethods used to assess the public health impact of the entry/exit screening and their result Methods used to appraise the cost-effectiveness of screening method and resultsEvaluation of method results: sensitivity, specificity, false positive/negative (of screening method), positive and negative predictive valuesDecision-making level: public health officers, ministry officers, regional, national, intersectoral collaboration, health, and border authoritiesCommunication channels Notification practices between neighboring and possibly affected countriesSpecific timeframe referred and duration\n\nThis bibliographic review concerns a literature review of already published material, and therefore ethics approval was not required.\n\nThe scoping search identified 82 scientific articles, six documents/reports from public health agencies of countries and 26 guidelines/reports from international organizations. \n\nIn total, 114 identified documents of scoping research can be categorized into the following categories:(a)Assessment for imported cases notification of infectious diseases(b)Dengue entry screening at airports(c)Preparedness and response planning for Ebola Virus Disease(d)Entry/exit screening measures for Ebola Virus Disease experience(e)Studies about evolution and predictions of Ebola Virus Disease spread(f)Entry/exit screening measures for infectious diseases(g)Influenza(h)Pandemic influenza preparedness(i)International air travel and infectious diseases(j)Preparedness planning for infectious disease(k)Screening measures at ground crossing(l)Sever Acute Respiratory Syndrome(m)Zika Virus Disease\n\nThe list of documents identified through the scoping search can be found in Appendix D, and is presented in thematic sections and in alphabetical order including authors, title, and year of publication. Twenty-four articles in Appendix D were also identified through the systematic bibliographic review search as described in Section 2.2.3. \n\nTable 3 summarizes the degree of success of the primary objective of screening measures in identifying ill or exposed travelers, the limitations and both the beneficial and adverse concomitant effects of entry and exit screening at points of entry for SARS, Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and EVD, as reported by the authors. Results concerning measures implemented as part of long-term measures for Dengue fever and not as a response to emergencies are not presented in Table 3. \n\nScreening measures as reported in the published literature were decided to be applied at the specific setting and situation, and generalizing conclusions was not considered to be appropriate [14]. Disease virulence, type, and severity of symptoms, length of incubation period, proportion of asymptomatic carriers, transmissibility, period of communicability, and mode of transmission were factors that determined the degree of success of screening measures depending on the disease, as well as the extent and evolution of the outbreak and the phase that measures were applied [18]. Finally, the country characteristics seemed to play a role such as whether the country was an island country or shared borders or had direct connections of flights or ship itineraries with affected countries [19]. For the previously mentioned reasons, no general conclusions about the impact of entry or exit screening for all infectious diseases could be drawn, and appraisal of impact should be done considering each specific disease and the context of screening measure implementation.\n\nData from the scoping search were used to develop the algorithm for making evidence-based decisions in implementing entry and exit screening measures (Appendix E). \n\n(1) Airports \n\nAustralia implemented entry screening measures at airports to prevent EVD [31], Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases [20] and SARS [8]. New Zealand implemented entry screening for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 at airports [21]. In Canada, entry and exit screening was applied for SARS [9] and entry screening for EVD at airports [22]. Peru implemented entry screening for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 at airports [32]. In China, entry screening took place for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 at airports [40]. In Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal, and Mali, exit screening was implemented for EVD at airports, seaports and ground crossings [6,16,22,28]. Japan implemented entry screening for EVD [38] and Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 at airports [24,26,39]. Singapore applied entry screening for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 at airports [36] and for SARS at airports, seaports and road entry points [23,29]. Taiwan applied entry screening at airports for SARS [35], Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 [33] and Zika virus disease [7] as an ad hoc measure at airports in response to public health emergencies. Moreover, entry screening for Dengue [7,10,11,15] and Chikungunya [7] were implemented as routine measures at airports. Regarding European countries, Belgium and United Kingdom implemented entry screening at airports for EVD [22,27,37]. Table 4 summarizes the entry and exit screening measures. \n\n(2) Ports \n\nEntry screening measures were implemented at seaports in four countries [8,23,27,29]. Exit screening measures were implemented at seaports for EVD in three counties [16]. A two-level program was applied at Australia\u2019s seaports for SARS, where the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service staff directly contacted the Chief Quarantine Officer to inform of ill passengers [8]. Temperature checks for SARS were introduced to all of Singapore\u2019s ferry/sea terminals [23,29]. The public health authorities of Belgium implemented entry screening for EVD at seaports located in priority areas [27]. In Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone exit screening for EVD at seaports included temperature checkpoints, followed by emergency medical response, on-site isolation and use of personal protective equipment for staff if necessary [16].\n\n(3) Ground crossings \n\nTwo articles [23,29] refer to entry screening measures for SARS implemented at road entry points, one [16] to exit screening measures for EVD at ground crossings, and two articles [27,37] refer to entry screening measures at a train station for EVD. Thermal scanners were installed at the road entry points of Singapore to check the temperatures of all departing and arriving passengers for SARS [23,29]. As reported by Cohen et al., in the land borders of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, simple exit screening measures involving visual screening for illness at designated official border crossings were applied for EVD [16]. Due to sparse, understaffed, and under-resourced official border points of entry, land borders were characterized as \u201cporous\u201d and it was not possible to apply measures similar to airports. Two articles refer to entry screening measures implemented at the Eurostar terminal/train station at London St Pancras for EVD [22,37]. Measures included visual and fever screening.\n\nTable 5 presents the timeframes of public health events, of screening measure implementation, and of temporary recommendations for screening measures issued by WHO. As presented in Table 5 Since the IHR 2005 entered into force in 2007, temporary recommendations for exit screening measures have been issued by WHO as part of a set of measures to be implemented in areas affected from outbreaks. This happened during the EVD epidemic in West Africa in 2014/2015, in the EVD outbreak in the (Democratic Republic Congo, DRC) in 2018 and during the plague outbreak in Madagascar in 2017 [5]. On the contrary, entry screening measures were not part of WHO temporary recommendations for the outbreaks of EVD in West Africa, Poliovirus, EVD outbreak in DRC, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Yellow fever, Zika virus disease, Plague and the Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 [5]. \n\nIn Taiwan entry screening was applied as a response to public health emergencies as well as on a routine basis. In particular, entry screening was applied for Zika virus disease for a total of 10 months (January to October 2016) [7]. Moreover, entry screening measures in Taiwan are applied on a routine basis for vector-borne diseases. The articles fulfilling the inclusion criteria reported results for entry screening routine measures for Chikungunya infection between 2013 and 2016 [7]. Routine entry screening for all inbound travelers for Dengue has been implemented since 2003 and is ongoing [7,10,11,15].\n\nOnly Taiwan implemented entry screening on a routine basis for Dengue and Chikungunya [7,10,11,15]. All other authors reported screening measures on an ad hoc basis in response to an emergency public health event.\n\nTargeted screening of incoming travelers arriving from affected countries was implemented in five countries for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 [21,24,26,33,39]. Six countries implemented massive general screening to all inbound travelers arriving at the airport for SARS and for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, as well as for Dengue fever and Chikungunya infection [8,9,10,15,20,29,32,35,36,40]. In one report the type of screening is not clearly described [28].\n\nScreening measures for SARS in Canada were decided by Health Canada [9] and in Singapore by the Ministerial Committee on SARS chaired by the Minister for Home Affairs [29]. In Japan, concerning Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and EVD, decisions were taken at the level of the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, while the response and measures of relevant ministries and agencies were coordinated at the Intergovernmental Coordination Meeting on EVD measures, chaired by the Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary for Crisis Management [26,38,39]. In New Zealand, the Ministry of Health and the Auckland Regional Public Health Service [21] and in Taiwan, the Central Epidemic Command Center were responsible for decision-making regarding the Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, Zika virus disease and Dengue fever screening measures [7,15,33]. \n\nAuthorities and officers involved in the implementation of screening measures were ministries of health, public health officers/inspectors or public health emergency staff, custom, and border control staff, airlines, airport, and port authorities, emergency medical service units at airports/ports, airline check-in agents, flight crews, airport ambulance services, physicians, nurses, quarantine officers, regional authorities and communities and fire brigade [6,7,9,20,21,26].\n\nHealth Canada introduced a traveler contact information form that collected contact details and information on location of stay that all inbound passengers were asked to fill in before arrival, when implementing entry screening for SARS [9]. Upon landing, all forms were collected from passengers by Health Canada personnel and retained for possible contact tracing if a case was subsequently identified. The traveler contact information form is believed to have reduced the time for securing the manifest from weeks to two days.\n\nDuring entry screening measures for EVD implemented in the US, contact information for inbound travelers from affected countries was entered into a database and transmitted to states through CDC\u2019s Epidemic Information Exchange (Epi-X) that is a secure notification system [6]. As part of entry screening in Australia for EVD, the Notifiable Conditions Information Management System database was used [31]. \n\nIn Taiwan, all data and diagnostic results of cases of Dengue fever identified through screening were reported through the web-based National Surveillance System, for later tracking and management of cases [10]. \n\nDuring entry and exit screening measures applied in Canada for SARS, Health Canada monitored the spread of SARS via the WHO-Health Canada Global Public Health Intelligence Network and regular communications with other international and Canadian provincial and territorial public health agencies documenting travel and illness histories of possible SARS cases who departed Canada and whose illnesses were diagnosed and reported internationally [9]. \n\nAs part of entry screening measures in Taiwan for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, information of suspected cases was delivered to the local health bureaus via the Internet Information System for subsequent follow-up [33]. \n\nIn China information was entered into an internet-based surveillance system; all community hospitals were authorized to access the system [40]. \n\nRegarding the screening protocols applied, both entry and exit screening included an initial assessment of exposure through completion of a questionnaire, temperature measurement, and if needed, secondary assessment by medical staff and laboratory testing. Screening measures were conducted at the point of entry facilities. One article reported that primary screening measures were conducted on board the aircraft [26]. Some countries combined screening measures for symptoms and exposure with risk communication and instructions strategies, and by offering equipment for body temperature measurement (Table 6). \n\nAs far as exit screening for EVD is concerned, visual screening, health questionnaires and temperature measurement (non-contact infrared thermometer) were applied [6,16,22,28]. \n\nSimilarly, entry screening for EVD included screening of travelers by asking questions about symptoms and potential exposure risks and temperature checks [6,16,22,28]. Entry screening measures for EVD in the US were combined with an educational and informing strategy to travelers passing through the screening points [6]. Each traveler arriving from an affected country received a Check and Report Ebola (CARE) kit that included health education materials, a thermometer, and ways to connect with their state or local health department, including a prepaid cell phone [28]. In Australia, a separate EVD-specific arrivals card was distributed [31]. \n\nFor exposure and/or symptoms assessment, travelers were asked to complete a questionnaire [6,7,9,10,11,16,20,22,23,26,27,29,31,35,37,38,39,40]. In addition to this, temperature measurements were conducted either with handheld non-contact infrared thermometers, or thermal imaging scanners [6,7,8,9,10,11,15,16,20,22,23,24,26,27,29,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40]. One article referring to entry screening for Zika virus disease [7] describes that travelers underwent visual assessment, and infrared cameras were used to detect abnormal temperatures. An ear thermometer was used to recheck temperature when necessary.\n\nVisual screening for the presence of symptoms was also part of the screening protocols [6,7,8,9,10,11,16,20,21,22,23,26,27,33,34,35,37,38,40] and/or rapid diagnostic tests [7,10,24,26,39] to identify suspected cases. Finally, medical and laboratory assessments were conducted for suspected travelers [6,7,8,9,10,11,15,16,20,21,22,23,24,26,27,29,31,32,33,34,35,36,38,39,40]. Methods for entry and exit screening, accompanying measures, response measures and laboratory diagnosis are summarized in Table 6.\n\nIn all but one article included in the literature review, entry screening to in-transit travelers has not been addressed. Those in-transit travelers were screened during entry screening measures for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 at the airport in Japan, either at the aircraft cabin or at the quarantine station at the terminal [39].\n\nTemperature measuring devices used to measure body temperature of travelers were electronic handheld or fixed/stationary non-contact thermometers, and ear or oral thermometers [6,7,8,9,10,11,15,16,20,22,24,26,28,29,33,35,36,39]. The specific model for temperature measuring devices was described in three articles: Flir A40 or Flir P20 [10] and TVS-500EX, (NEC Avio Infrared Technologies Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) [24,39]. Non-contact thermometers were used mainly in primary screening, and contact or minimal contact thermometers in secondary screening.\n\nScreening protocols for SARS in Canada, Taiwan, and Singapore used thermal scanning machines as part of the primary screening, while as part of the secondary screening, Australia and Taiwan used ear temperature thermometers and Canada used oral temperature thermometers [8,9,35]. \n\nScreening measures implemented in response to Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in Australia, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan were conducted using stationary infrared thermoscanners [20,24,26,33,36,39]. In Japan ear or axillary temperature measuring devices were also used [24]. Entry primary screening temperature measurements in the US and exit primary screening temperature measurements in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone were conducted with handheld NCITs [6,22].\n\nEntry screening measures for SARS did not identify any confirmed cases in the studies included in this review; however, cases of SARS were notified in the countries where screening took place. Entry and exit screening measures for EVD did not identify any confirmed cases. In the two (United States, United Kingdom) out of the five countries that implemented entry screening (Australia, Japan, United States, Belgium, United Kingdom), EVD disease cases were imported (one case in the UK and nine in the US), but were asymptomatic during travel [27,34]. The detection rate of confirmed Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases among all passengers screened ranged from 2.2 to 0.01 per 10,000 travelers in China and Japan, respectively [24,40].\n\nThe numbers of travelers screened and identified as suspected and confirmed can be found in Table 7 for entry screening and in Table 8 for exit screening. Table 7 and Table 8 include surveillance data of cases from countries that implemented entry/exit screening for the infectious diseases [15,41,42,43,44,45,46,47].\n\nFor SARS, six out of the 46 suspected cases identified through entry screening measures for SARS were diagnosed with atypical pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with secondary infection or bronchopneumonia in Taiwan [35]. SARS was not confirmed in any suspected cases. \n\nIn Australia, four hospitalized persons were ultimately given an alternative or undetermined diagnosis other than the initial targeted SARS [8]. \n\nFor Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, Among 391 travelers identified as suspect cases during entry screening measures applied for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in Japan, five were diagnosed as influenza type A and one as type B [26]; while genotyping showed that among the five type A cases, one was Russian flu (H1N1), one was Hong Kong flu (H3N2), and three were Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009. \n\nSimilarly, two other articles [24,39] described cases that were finally diagnosed with Influenza type A or B, and not the Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 that screening targeted in Japan. \n\nFor EVD, during entry screening measures applied for EVD in Australia, six out of 123 screened travelers from EVD-affected countries developed symptoms compatible with EVD, and when further assessed, were diagnosed with influenza or upper respiratory tract infection [31]. Entry screening measures applied for EVD in Japan identified nine individuals with compatible symptoms, who were finally diagnosed with malaria (four travelers), influenza (four travelers) and other (one traveler) [38]. In an article describing entry screening procedures for Zika virus disease in Taiwan, five out of 21,083,404 inbound screened passengers were laboratory-confirmed cases of Zika virus disease; whereas 130 cases of Dengue fever and four cases of Chikungunya infection were found [7].\n\nNone of the 27 articles fulfilling the eligibility criteria systematically conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis for entry or exit screening measures. Five articles addressed issues for the cost of screening measures (Table 9) [9,10,15,20,23].\n\nTable 6 summarizes the case management where available. Concerning the applied protocol after diagnosis and management of cases of Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, two articles described how patients positive for H1N1 were hospitalized/isolated, and close contacts or persons seated within 2 m around the index patient during the flight were quarantined [26,39]. One article described that persons tested positive to H1N1 with RT-PCR were offered oseltamivir, and were sent home or to a facility for isolation [21]. The ECDC report describes the management of treating EVD patients in designated hospitals, including isolation, personal protective equipment, samples, waste management and post-mortem procedures [27].\n\nIn respect to health measures applied to the travelers during the exit screening for EVD, the ECDC technical report refers that 77 out of 36,000 screened travelers were identified and denied boarding, although none were later diagnosed with EVD [22]. \n\nAnother ECDC report concerning entry screening for EVD, describes that in the UK persons in the low and higher risk exposure categories were monitored for 21 days after leaving the country of interest by public health emergency services [27]. \n\nThe Health Canada\u2019s protocols for airplane passenger contact tracing had evolved during the SARS outbreak and were updated during the Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 [9]. At the beginning, contact tracing of passengers included follow-up of passengers seated in the same row, two rows in front, and two rows behind someone with a probable case, who was symptomatic while in flight. Later, contact tracing was expanded to include persons who were contacts to suspected cases while in flight. In Japan, local authorities received contact information about overseas travelers from the competent authority at the airport and monitored their health daily by phone. Later on, the observation by local authorities was performed for seven days only for those seated within two meters from a patient [26]. \n\nDuring the implementation of entry screening measures for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in Japan, patients positive for H1N1 were isolated, and close contacts were quarantined [39]. At first, health monitoring by health centers was performed for passengers arriving from affected countries, and later for only those who had come into contact with the individuals identified by entry screening. Enhanced surveillance included mandatory reporting of details of the infected individuals. An entry card was given to all arriving passengers instructing them to consult with staff at public health centers in the event of developing symptoms while in Japan. \n\nIn another article [40] general practitioners at the community hospitals performed medical follow-up on the foreign travelers, who were contacted daily for 7 days after entry into Beijing by the general practitioners by telephone or face-to-face interview, in order to report on their health status. When a traveler reported having influenza-like illness symptoms, she/he was asked to attend the jurisdictional hospital for testing.\n\nRegarding challenges, 11 out of 26 articles refer to limitations, failures, and mishaps of applied screening measures. \n\nSamaan et al. noted that the applied screening measures may still have been ineffective due to false declarations by travelers, denying contact with people with SARS, or taking antipyretic drugs to conceal fever [8]. Lee et al. mentioned that travelers tried to conceal symptoms so as to be treated in Taiwan where medical fees were lower than in Hong Kong during the SARS outbreak (Figure 2) [35]. St John et al. highlighted that screening measures (health alert questionnaires and thermal scanning machines) were non-specific for SARS [9]. \n\nRegarding screening measures for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (Figure 3), Gunaratnam et al. referred to the underestimation in the number of cases acquired overseas [20]. Fujita et al. noted that during the incubation period, when patients have no symptoms or high fever, it is almost impossible to identify patients by quarantine officers, coupled with the quick inspection kit having only about 70% accuracy [26]. Similarly, Hale et al. attributed ineffectiveness (estimated sensitivity 5.8%) of screening measures to the high proportion of asymptomatic infected travelers, incubation of infections acquired before or during a flight, reliance on self-identification, limitations of case definitions, and limitations of thermal scanning [21]. \n\nThe authors of the 27 articles fulfilling the eligibility criteria of the current review attempted to assess the impact of screening measures or commented on the impact, as presented in Table 10. Assessment of public health impact.\n\nIn Appendix F, WHO statements (concerning screening and travel restrictions in relation to public health events) that were used in the current report are presented.\n\nThe screening methods protocol design and the robustness of application can influence the effectiveness of screening measures [50]. The exposure and symptom assessment methods, the tools and type of equipment used, and the number of staff involved and their training play an important role in the outcome of screening measures [50]. Screening protocols for symptoms and exposure assessment included questionnaires, health alert leaflets, visual checks, and body temperature measurements. Each method has its strengths and limitations [22]. In the reviewed evidence, self-reporting of exposure and symptoms in questionnaires relies on the honesty of the responder, language barriers exist, and fever symptoms can be concealed by antipyretic drug use [8]. Screening cannot detect incubating or asymptomatic travelers [24]. Fever and other symptoms are non-specific and planning and resources are needed for possible high demand of laboratory tests [22]. During the EVD epidemic in West Africa in 2014/2015, (Figure 4) some travelers attempted to escape entry screening by presenting passports which did not show that they had traveled to an affected country [51]. In general, the prevalence of disease targeted by screening is very low among travelers, and the positive predictive values and the sensitivity of screening measures are expected to be very low for the diseases targeted through screening [9]. This is expected especially when general massive (to all travelers) rather than targeted screening measures (e.g., to travelers coming from affected countries or certain direct flights) are applied.\n\nData from the systematic bibliographic review were used to develop the algorithm for making evidence-based decisions in implementing entry and exit screening measures (Appendix E). \n\nEvidence from this review about prevention of international transmission of disease by detecting and prohibiting travel to exposed or ill travelers from affected countries is mainly based on the measures implemented in response to EVD in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal, and Mali [6,16,28,49]. In total, about 300,000 were screened in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, but no case was detected through exit screening measures. During the study reporting period, four confirmed cases were exported through air travel during the exit screening measure implementation, but were not symptomatic while traveling [16]. EVD is a disease with high pathogenicity and a very low number of asymptomatic cases [52]. Consequently, it is probably unlikely that additional cases would have been exported through air or sea travel without being detected by surveillance systems in the destination non-affected countries. \n\nAn assessment of the impact of exit screening measures at ground crossings is much more challenging than at airports and seaports. The 2014/2015 Ebola outbreak spread through the population movement in the land borders of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone and was later introduced to Senegal and Mali [16]. As reported by Cohen et al., the implementation of land-border screening measures was challenging given the high mobility of populations through formal and informal points [16]. It was not possible to apply at ground crossings the same protocols that were applied at airports and seaports. Exit screening at ground crossings combined visual checks for symptomatic persons at official ground crossings, health education, and community engagement, as well as implementation of plans for isolation, communication, assessment, referral, and transportation. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published evidence meeting the inclusion/search criteria about the positive impact of screening measures at ground crossings in preventing the exportation of EVD cases from affected countries. \n\nExit screening measures may have helped to prevent extensive travel and trade restrictions, by providing confidence to the different stakeholders that measures are in place to protect the public from exportation of cases. As stated by Rhymer and Speare, travel and trade restrictions disregarding WHO recommendations were implemented worldwide in 58 (31.0%) of 187 WHO State Parties [53]. Exit screening measures may have balanced the overreactions. Exit screening measures enabled business continuity to trade and transport sectors, as well as the continuation of public health organizations and humanitarian missions to support the affected countries [16,27,28]. Another secondary effect of screening measures is that thorough exit screening measures at borders may have played a role in discouraging ill or exposed persons from attempting to leave the affected countries [25]. \n\nIt is unknown how many cases would have been exported if exit screening measures at the points of entry of the affected countries would not have been implemented. Even if no case was detected through exit screening measures, concomitant benefits from exit screening measures may be of paramount importance and should also be considered when assessing impact and making decisions for health measures. Considering that all countries should be prepared to deal with unexpected events as laid down in the IHR 2005, and lessons learnt are available from past events for which temporary recommendations for exit screening measures were issued by WHO, all countries should have the capacities to implement exit screening measures at points of entry (designated airports, ports, and ground crossings), and this should be part of the preparedness planning [3,5].\n\nSince the IHR 2005 entered into force in 2007, temporary recommendations for exit screening measures have been issued by WHO as part of a set of measures to be implemented in areas affected from outbreaks [5]. On the contrary, entry screening was recommended only for specific settings and timeframes by WHO, and only in response to the Ebola outbreak in DRC in 2018 [5]. Moreover, advice was given that if entry screening measures are implemented, countries should consider that \u201centry screening may have a limited effect in reducing international spread when added to exit screening, and its advantages and disadvantages should be carefully considered\u2026 if entry screening is implemented, States should take into account the following considerations: it offers an opportunity for individual sensitization, but the resource demands may be significant, even if screening is targeted; and management systems must be in place to care for travelers and suspected cases in compliance with International Health Regulations (IHR) requirements\u201d [5]. \n\nThe primary objective of entry screening measures is to prevent or to delay introduction of ill or incubating cases to a country. Evidence for achieving this primary objective is based on the measures implemented in response to the EVD epidemic in West Africa in 2014/2015, SARS, Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and Zika virus disease, as well as entry screening measures implemented on a routine basis for Dengue fever and Chikungunya infection. None of the countries that implemented entry screening for SARS detected any case [8,9,23,29,35]. For Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 the detection rate ranged from 0.01 to 2.2 confirmed cases per 10,000 persons screened [20,21,24,26,32,33,39,40]. A survey conducted by WHO showed an aggregate rate of 4 confirmed cases per 1,000,000 screened travelers for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in 10 countries [50]. For EVD, no case was identified through entry screening measures [6,27,28,31,34,37,38]. For Zika virus disease, five cases were identified and more than 21,000,000 persons screened [7]. Routine entry screening measures for Dengue fever showed a detection rate of less than 8%. It should be noted that the diseases targeted by entry screenings such as SARS, EVD and the Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 have a very low prevalence among travelers, therefore the positive predictive value of entry screening is expected to be close to zero [9]. Cowling and colleagues compared the dates of the first reported case of Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in countries which implemented entry screening measures with countries that did not implement such measures. They concluded that entry screening may delay the introduction of a new influenza strain for about 7\u201312 days [54]. However, it should be noted that it was not possible for the study to assess which measures other than entry screening implemented by the countries have contributed to delaying introduction. \n\nSeveral attempts were made by researchers to evaluate the public health impact of entry screening measures by comparing numbers of cases identified through screenings at airports with the total number of imported cases, or with cases locally acquired in the country in the same timeframe. However, the onset of symptoms was not assessed in all cases and it is not clear if the imported cases passed through screening were symptomatic or incubating. Entry screening at airports implemented on routine basis proved to be successful in Taiwan (an island) in identifying about half of the imported cases of Dengue fever [7,10]. Twelve out of 59 imported cases of Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were detected through entry screening within 54 days of entry screening [33]. In Japan, 6.6% (10/151) of Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases were identified by airport entry screening [39]. Another study in Japan showed that only 11 confirmed cases of Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were detected through entry screening, but 633 cases were diagnosed among the Japanese population and about 20% of them had passed through the entry screening [26]. The detection rate of Dengue fever and Chikungunya infection was higher than that of influenza. This can be attributed to the difference in the severity of symptoms and whether it can be observable or measurable when passing the entry points at airports, as well as the rate of persons who will ask for medical care in the health care system and will be captured by the routine surveillance system. Moreover, this can be attribute to the fact that entry screening for vector-borne diseases in Taiwan has been implemented on a routine basis for long periods of time and not as part of response measures to emergencies that are implemented in short periods of time. \n\nAccording to the results of this review, evidence suggested that the primary objective of entry screening implemented in response to public health emergencies\u2014which is to detect imported cases at borders\u2014was not achieved, but several beneficial concomitant effects have been reported in several instances, including educating travelers passing through the screening points, providing contacts of public health authorities to travelers in case they develop symptoms, collecting contact details for contact tracing, maintaining confidence that air travel is safe, preserving public confidence, and helping to avoid major economic, social and international impacts which even a single imported severe disease can cause [6,23,25]. Entry screening alone seems to be ineffective in preventing or delaying introduction of diseases to a country; however, it could be justified for severe diseases, as part of a set of measures complementing each other, after setting priorities and where there are available resources [26]. The ECDC suggests that entry screening at airports in combination with exit screening could be of value, if exit screening measures are questionable and if the timeframe between departure and arrival at the destination country is long [22]. \n\nThe research strategy of this bibliographic review did not reveal statistical data specifically for entry screening at ground crossings. Crossing land borders for sick, symptomatic persons may be easier than moving through air or sea means of transport. The density of populations crossing land borders can be very intense or not at all from place to place. The EVD epidemic in West Africa in 2014/2015 spread between the affected countries in West Africa through land borders [16]. This fact should be considered by policy makers for preparedness planning. Countries where many official and unofficial crossing points exist or countries where border checks are not routinely conducted at ground crossings may not be well prepared to respond. Preparedness activities for potential unexpected events should include plans for implementation of screening measures at ground crossings. Screening measures at land borders require cooperation among neighboring countries and regions. However, considering the previously reported challenges and the lack of evidence on the impact of entry screening measures at ground crossings, this area may represent a gap in preparedness in the event of a high risk of exportation/introduction and spread of disease through land borders of neighboring countries. \n\nVery limited information is available about the cost and cost-effectiveness of screening measures. General entry screening measures at airports of Australia for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, Canada for SARS, and Taiwan for Dengue fever cost about US$50,000 per case detected (airport clinic staffing cost), a total of 7.55 million Can$ investment for a period of four months, and US$ 43,000 for each set of instruments used at screening, respectively [10]. Investing in screening measures reduces the resources from other possibly more effective measures [9,23]. Further cost-effectiveness studies could be conducted to analyze the cost and benefits of screening measures, and to compare these with other public health measures to inform decision-makers. \n\nAlthough the inability of entry screening measures to identify cases of SARS in the 2003 outbreak was known during the public health emergencies that occurred the following years, decision-making during the Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and the EVD epidemic in West Africa in 2014/2015 seemed to be based on other reasons. Several authors suggest that screening measures in several cases may have been implemented mainly to relieve political and social pressure, and limit negative economic consequences from travel and trade restrictions [8], as well as to preserve public confidence [8,9,29] and maintain confidence that air travel is safe [6]. \n\nWhen temporary recommendations from WHO for screening measures have been issued in response to a public health event, then countries should have the capacities to implement such measures. Other factors of consideration are: the disease severity, the transmissibility (and whether the transmission takes place before or after symptom onset), the mode of transmission, the incubation period, the symptomatology of disease, and how easily the disease can be detected, the proportion of febrile patients, the temporal and spatial extent and the phase of the outbreak, any available results from modeling studies, the type of country, and point of entry, the disease epidemiology in the country, the volume of travelers and connections to affected areas (Appendix E). All these factors should be considered to estimate the possible expected detection rates, and to balance this with other measures that could be implemented, and the cost and effectiveness of those. A mathematical model presented by Gostic, K.M., and colleagues, demonstrated how different factors of six disease and outbreak characteristics and human behavior can affect screening measures\u2019 effectiveness. It showed that \u201cfor pathogens with longer incubation periods, exposure risk detection dominates in growing epidemics, while fever becomes a better target in stable or declining epidemics. For pathogens with short incubation, fever screening drives detection in any epidemic stage. However, even in the most optimistic scenario arrival screening will miss the majority of cases\u201d [18].\n\nThe scoping search identified several studies reporting results of modeling that can inform decision-makers about the potential effects of entry screening measure implementation. A study modeled the number of expected Ebola infected travelers exiting affected countries, the potential effect of air travel restrictions, and the efficiency of airport-based traveler screening at international points of entry and exit [55]. The study concluded that exit screening measures at three airports in the affected countries would be successful in assessing all potentially exposed or Ebola-affected travelers. Another study created a model to assess the effectiveness of entry screening for the 2009 Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) in the US and concluded that it will not significantly delay arrival of influenza cases by air travel, but will reduce the rate of new US cases and subsequent deaths [56].\n\nIf entry or exit screening measures are decided to be implemented, detailed planning is required, with careful execution to ensure consistent application by all staff involved and to all targeted travelers. The timing (starting and stopping of screening measures), the screening methods, the technology and tools, the human resources and training issues should be considered in the preparedness and response plans. Training of staff is an important component and should address recognizing the signs and symptoms of the disease, screening procedures and documentation, and appropriate use of personal protective equipment and technology for measuring body temperature [6]. \n\nInterview space must be available at the facilities of the point of entry as required by the IHR 2005 [3]. The WHO suggests that preparedness plans\u2019 functionality should be periodically tested with simulation exercises [57]. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for entry or exit screening measures could be tested in practice with simulation exercises. Documented, regularly updated and tested national guidelines and SOPs for health measures at points of entry, including entry and exit screening, are checked in the framework of the joint external evaluation of core capacities [58]. Capacities for entry and exit screening should be part of the national planning. \n\nThe most suitable site of primary and secondary screening should be decided: on board the conveyance, at the terminal, or before or after checking in or collecting luggage. Gaber and colleagues suggest that exit screening at airports should take place before travelers deliver luggage at the terminal, to avoid the checking-in of suitcases from infected travelers that later may need to be traced and removed [59]. \n\nFurther essential resources include capacities for laboratory diagnosis, quarantine, isolation, and treatment of suspected exposed or affected travelers. In the US, during the EVD epidemic in West Africa in 2014/2015 customs and border protection officers conducted the primary entry screening at airports and public health officers conducted the secondary screening [6]. As suggested previously, entry screening should be part of a broader set of measures and different stakeholders need to cooperate. Both the public and the private sectors, the transport industry, points of entry administrations and actors at all levels, from the local point of entry to the national, EU and international level should be involved [7]. Guidance and advice entry and exit screening measures from international organizations may further support decision-making. \n\nOther issues for consideration about entry screening are the identification of targeted travelers or itineraries at ports, airports, and ground crossings, including lists of returning workers from missions in affected countries (if applicable, obtained from aid recruiting organizations), lists of visas granted to affected countries, disclosure policies, and expert support on legal, communication, health advisory and others issues [31,38]. \n\nThis bibliographic review showed that most of the entry primary fever screening for SARS, Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and vector-borne diseases was conducted using thermal scanner cameras, followed when necessary by secondary screening using NCITs or contact thermometers. An ECDC technical report reviewed evidence about the accuracy of body temperature measuring devices and concluded that there are a variety of technologies available commercially; some NCITs are approved for use as diagnostic tools as happens with the contact thermometers, but thermal scanner cameras have not been evaluated for such purpose [22]. The report continues that NCITs are more accurate than the thermal scanner cameras. The US CDC evaluated the performance of NCITs, showing a sensitivity of 80\u201399% and a specificity of 75\u201399%. Equipment calibration and accuracy checks according to manufacturers\u2019 instructions, and training of staff in the correct use are essential during screening measure implementation. \n\nResearch questions of the bibliographic review were answered based on published information; much more unpublished evidence may exist that could not be considered. Many other countries had implemented entry screening measures in response to the 2009 Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) on the European region, but very few of them published screening results and experience [50]. Databases searched index health-related publications; it is possible that additional publications exist related to cost-effectiveness of screening measures. Language bias could be one limitation of the review, since only articles in English, Dutch, German, and Greek were included in the review. In total, four articles were excluded due to language. Moreover, bias could occur from the fact that most of the published literature is about entry screening measures, rather than exit screening.\n\nScreening measures to migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers were not under the scope of this review. In case of forced migration travelers often cross borders through unofficial points (land crossings or arriving by boats at coastlines) and not the official points of entry where authorities and structures exists. In this case, the authorities that are involved in screening and the procedures are different from what is applied at the official points of entry for regular travelers. Moreover, if migrants arrive in a country at the official points of entry, each country implements its own policy in terms of targeted diseases and examinations. This review did not analyze data from screening measures to migrants. \n\nFor preparedness purposes and to be ready to respond to any unexpected public health event, all countries should have the capacities to implement entry and exit screening at designated ports, airports, and ground crossings. Exit screening measures could be prioritized compared to entry measures, based on past temporary recommendations issued during PHEIC. Evidence from this review suggests that entry screening measures alone are not effective in detecting imported cases at borders, but may allow opportunities for raising awareness and educating the traveling public. The current review further suggests that there are difficulties in assessing the impact of border screening measures. Statistical data demonstrate very low detection rates of cases in both entry and exit screening. The decision about the implementation of screening measures should be examined on a case-by-case basis, after considering the disease and outbreak characteristics, the country situation, and the available resources, which can be compared to the cost and effectiveness of other alternative measures. Screening measures have important concomitant effects when implemented in combination with health education and informative strategies for travelers, the decision-making process should take those effects into consideration. Specificities at each type of point of entry (port, airport, ground crossing) should be considered for the implementation of screening measures, since different approaches are needed for each type of point of entry. The implementation of entry and exit screening measures require planning, allocation of resources, and careful design and application of protocols. Decision-makers should be aware and consider the limitations of screening methods, including false declarations by passengers about exposure and disease signs and symptoms, use of antipyretic drugs to conceal fever by travelers, inability to detect incubating or asymptomatic travelers, language barriers, and false positive and false negative results expected from temperature measuring devices. Based on review results, an algorithm about decision-making for entry/exit screening was developed. Guidance and advice on decision-making related to entry and exit screening measures from international organizations would be helpful to countries when developing their preparedness plans, as well as when deciding about response measures to public health events. Training of staff are among the key issues for implementing a robust screening program at points of entry. "}
