{"title": "Methods for Virus Recovery from Solids", "body": "Our first examination of virus in treated and untreated wastewater i90 \u0395. Lund was in the years 1964 and 1965. At first we were quite contended to leave out a spontaneous sediment from our wastewater samples, but when the results from swab samples invariably came out with much more positive samples, as Melnick and co-workers (19 58) had shown, we became suspicious. If a mere squeezing of a swab would do it , viruses in wastewater must be different from proper laboratory sus pensions, in fact the viruses must be solid associated. We became very careful not to let any fraction escape no matter how disagreable the samples were for inoculations (Lund and Hedstrom, 1966 , Lund, Hedstrom and Jantzen, 1969 . Wellings and co-workers (1975, 19 76) showed that 70-90 per cent of influent and effluent samples are solid-associated and point out that the techniques be ing used fail to address the question of solids-associated virus, i.e. virus that is an integral part of a solid as opposed to mere ly being adsorbed thereon. Moore and co-workers (19 74) reported among others that solid associated virus is infectious. It seems that in those years many workers become aware of the importance of the solid-associated virus and agreed with Schaub and Sorber (19 76) when they concluded that \"Many of the methods used to concentrate and assay viruses in natural waters and wastewaters do not recover those viruses adsorbed to suspended material. Although it complicates the problem of recovering viruses, virus adsorption to solids is real and must be considered in the assessment of any water\". Thus most of the virus detection methods for water and wastewater pub lished in those years must be quantitatively less than optimal.\n\nClarke and co-workers (1961) showed that virus in wastewater adsorbs to settleable solids to 67-79% and Kelly and co-workers (1961) showed that around half of the virus is removed by settling. It seems that we might long ago have taken the consequences of these observations. For instance it seems quite reasonable that in the situation where virus examinations of various wastewaters and treat ments are so difficult and expensive to carry out we might get valuable guidance from analysis of BOD and suspended solids. We are seeking suitable indicators because we realize that faecal coliforms are not very helpful and may be we already have the necessary data at hand for evaluating treatment efficiency by looking at the routine determinations of BOD and suspended solids. Balluz (1977) reports that the efficiency of a treatment plant to remove virus is closely related to its capacity to remove suspended solids.\n\nThis statement can easily be confirmed. Lund (1971 Lund ( , 1973 Lund ( , 1976 found viruses in primary sludges in a number of cases where the corre sponding raw wastewaters did not yield viruses. In various chemical treatments in a Copenhagen pilotplant (table 1) the same was the case. In other cases a concentration procedure was required for virus de monstration from wastewater, when direct inoculation was enough for the corresponding sludge sample. When it is remembered that in pri mary settling about half the virus will go with the sludge and that the primary sludge has a volume of about 0.5 per cent of the raw wastewater from which it originates these findings are not surprising. In fact before we get methods for virus demonstration in primary sludge that give more than 10-fold and preferably 100 fold as much virus from sludge samples than from wastewater samples our methods for solid associated virus are probably not good enough, even if the wastewater methods were.\n\nFrom this kind of reasoning it may also be deducted that some sludge disposal practices may be hazardous from a virological point of view and that efforts to improve the methodology of virus detection from sludge samples may be justified, so that a more firm base for public health precautions may be obtained.\n\nA number of studies have been carried out on the adsorption of vi ruses to various materials in the laboratory and under field condi tions. Some studies have to do with virus detection methods from water and others with soil adsorption etc. As the reversible nature of such adsorption is often demonstrated the information thus ob tained should be useful also when the opposite i.e. the desorp tion of solid-associated virus is desired.\n\n(1979) studied detection limits at each stage of sample processing they found that recovery efficiency is sacrified to obtain more sensitivity. They did attempt to demonstrate virus in precipitates.\n\nResults are obtained by subtracting results from liquid parts of the samples.\n\nThey studied various soils in batches and in columns. These models may seem remote for the present subject of methods, but an important conclusion may be drawn: The ability of a soil to adsorb virus par ticles cannot be judged solely on the basis of the various tests which normally are employed to characterize a soil. The adsorption increases with increasing clay content, silt content, ion-exchange capacity and glycerol-retention capacity, but a soil could be ranked lower than other soils in any one or all of these proper ties and still rank highest in virus-adsorption ability. The con clusion must thus remain that although we know of a number of fac tors important also for desorption,. there are a number of unknowns and interactions take place, so that various solids may behave dif ferently under different circumstances. Many times the disagreable solid-associated virus situation has been to some degree avoided by the use of experimental columns and lysometers. This has for in stance been done by Scheuerman and co-workers (19 79), when they study the transport of viruses through organic soils and sediments. They point out that humic materials interfere significantly with 192 \u0395. Lund the adsorption capacity of poliovirus to a sandy soil. CaCl2 may re store the sorptive capacity and so does removing of the humic mate rials. Humic acid might thus be a useful eluent for the detection of viruses. This approach has apparently never been used. Vilker and Burge (1980) have attempted mathematical models for vi rus adsorption, but so many data seem needed before models relevant for the field situation can be established reliably, that we have still to rely on empirically obtained results.\n\nThe following is by no means an attempt to cover all published pro cedures or variants of techniques. Many publications may not be mentioned, but it is attempted to take up the principal features of a number of available methods. It seems unfortunate that so many descriptions do not contain any indication why this particular pro cedure were preferred rather than another. Some publications, e.g. Bertucci and co-workers (19 77), report the use of a high amount of antibiotics. The methods employing sonica tion or blending this treatment apparently is sufficient to de contaminate, but Lund and Hedstrom (1966) found that 10 per cent of samples were still contaminated after sonication. Direct inoculation. Bertucci and co-workers (19 77) seeded samples with high concentrations of virus, so that they could expect proper recovery even if not quantitative method was available for concentra tion. They sonicated the samples and found 80-120 per cent recovery. Sanders and co-workers (1979) centrifuged their samples, tested the supernatant directly and resuspended the.solids. No real estima tion of the efficiency is given. Fenters and co-workers (i979)prefer cen trifugation at 20,000 g to obtain sludge supernatants that were employed as seeded samples. Lund (1971) \n\nWellings and co-workers (19 75, 19 76) pretreat with beef extract at pH 9, sonicate, stir for 18 hours and fluorocarbon treat in a blendor. Ward, Ashley and Moseley (1976) and employ sonication with 0.1-0.2 sodium dodecyl sulphate. No loss in recovery was found, when virus was mixed in raw sludge, but a loss of 25-50% occurred with digested sludge. Balluz and co-workers (19 77) centrifuged at 1500 g. The supernatant was tested and the solids resuspended and sonicated.\n\nElution at high pH. Moore and co-workers (19 74) eluted with borate buffer at pH 9.0. Subrahmanyan (1977) found that pH 9.5 was the best because virus became inactivated at higher pH and virus was not recovered at lower pH. Tierny and co-workers (19 77) studied virus contaminated vegetables. They were extracted at pH 8.5 and clarified through glass wool and membrane filtered.\n\nGerba and co-workers (19 79) studied virus recovery from marine sedi ments. As direct inoculation would only work with heavily polluted sample they eluted with glycine at pH 11.5, concentrated at pH 3.5 and eluted the filtered material with glycine at pH 11.5.\n\nfound, as is shown in table 2, quite varied results with variations in methodology. Lydholm and Nielsen (1980) compared direct inocula tion, precipitation at pH 3 followed by beef extract elution and alum flocculation followed by trisbuffer elution. Their results on some sludge samples are shown in table 3. The direct inocula tion failed on these materials, but it seems indicated that more than one method should be employed on unknown samples.\n\nquality, so gradually its use seems discontinued. In connection with studies of drying bed sludges and land application of sludges it was found that the sludges to which sludge thickeners have been added more frequently yielded viruses than other sludges. Nielsen and Lydholm (unpublished;results) studied the use of these polyacrylamid sludge thickeners and found it very satisfactory to employ them for virus detection in the following way: To a 20 ml aliguOt the polyacrylaraid (e.g. 100 ppm of Zetag, molecular weight 10 J was added at pH 5.5. The floe formed was ^iltemd. through a 1 i^n nesh \u0395. Lund sieve or a loose cotton plug. Elution was performed at pH 9 using glycine buffer or beef extract. With seeded samples the recovery was very high (60-120%) with less than one per cent of the virus in the filtrate. With natural samples the eluates were concentrated by poly ethylene glycol hydroextraction. In table 4 some results obtained using this method are compiled. The samples are collected in August-September 1978 from three treatment plants at Copenhagen and a num ber of technical data were obtained for the sludges.\n\nNone of the methods described are yet supported by large amounts of data and few studies are available that compare the efficiency of one method with another under the same conditions. There are many indications that solid-associations vary in different types of ma terials and that components in the samples influence desorption and also the sensitivity of the cell cultures.\n\nDeterminations of plaque forming units are in some cases less than optimal and although some methods give good quantitative recovery with known amounts of exogenously added viruses, it is most diffi cult to evaluate whether they are quantitative when employed on field samples. It is suspected that they may be much less efficient for some types of samples. A virus isolation cannot be regarded finished before identification is made. There is a danger that re ported virus plaques are false positives. In a report (Jakubowski, 19 79) where alkaline (pH 10.5) elution is used followed by freon treatment and hydro extraction and a final sonification is employed all the 58 plaques demonstrated in the material proved to be nega tive on passage. It seems to be a warning signal that even a very careful procedure may lead into a very difficult situation.\n\nDirect inoculation often seems advantageous and probably always should be carried out. The virus level may, however, be so low that a concentration procedure is required. From for instance the work of Tierny and co-workers (1977) the relation between virus level and recovery efficiency is pointed out: A good recovery (80%) was reported when soil and plants were inoculated with 10 PFU per 100 g, but the efficiency of the method, which includes filterinq of samples through 0.45 um filter membranes, but did not include elu tion of any kind, decreased with decreasing virus load. It is re ported that the method worked well at 100 PFU per 100 g. Below that level the efficiency decreased and at 10 PFU per 100 g no virus was detected.\n\nNone of the methods studied have employed more than a few virus types. Gayal and Gerba (19 79) observed a great deal of variability in the way various viruses adsorb to soil, even strain differences were found. It must be assumed that viruses may vary in a corre sponding way when elution is attempted. In our efforts to obtain good recovery from solids we should, however, stop and think if it matters too much if we get 30 per cent or 99.8 per cent recovery. As long as legislation mentioning exact limits for this or that is forced upon us we can probably accept such a situation.\n\nA grave problem is the fact that it is only a few virus types or families we have methods for. Goyal and Gerba (1979) have worked a little with a simian rotavirus and Smith and Gerba (1980) have de-tected rotaviruses in wastewater. That is a beginning. We are at a point where we have to admit that from many points of very the realitively easily grown enteroviruses are may be not the most im portant ones to detect. We now know that we have a need for methods for hepatitis virus, coronavirus, parvovirus in addition to the ones working for reo and adenoviruses. Suitable cultivation methods are not yet ready, but the importance of a number of newer viruses for gastroentestinal troubles in man and animals is recognized. "}
