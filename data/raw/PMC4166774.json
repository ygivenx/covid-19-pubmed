{"title": "Computer aided prediction and identification of potential epitopes in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS-CoV", "body": "MERS-CoV is an enveloped positive sense single stranded\nRNA virus from betacoronavirus genus. Its natural reservoir is\nstill unidentified but similarity with other viruses suggested\nthat it is of bat origin [1]. Infection with MERS-CoV is\ncharacterized mostly by severe acute respiratory syndrome\n(SARS). Clinical symptoms also include fever, fever with chills\nor rigours, cough, shortness of breath and in some cases renal\nfailure. Gastrointestinal symptoms were also found in infected\npatients including diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pain \n[2].\nThe first official outbreak was recorded in Saudi Arabia on\nSeptember 2012. Recurrent infections of MERS-CoV has been\nreported from 2012 to 2014 in Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,\nSaudi Arabia (KSA), United Arab Emirates (UAE), Yemen,\nEgypt, Tunisia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and United\nKingdom. According to the World Health Organization\n(WHO), till date a total of 536 laboratory-confirmed cases of\nMERS-CoV infections have been identified, 145 of which\nresulted in death (http://www.who.int /csr/disease\n/coronavirus infections/archive_updates/en). Though it has\nnot hit the world population in a massive scale yet, its\nprogressive invasiveness with concerning fatality rate raises\nthe demand of therapeutic solutions or vaccination on an\nurgent basis.\n\nThe field of Computational Immunology is developing\nrapidly. Current tools enable us to predict potential epitopes\nfrom large protein antigens encoded by viral genomes.\nIdentification of B- and T-cell epitopes and their respective\nMHC alleles is the crucial step for the very initial screening\nprocess of immunoinformatics approach [3].\n\nCoronavirus possess a non-structural replicase polyprotein\nand several structural proteins including spike (S), envelope\n(E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [4,\n5]. Like\nother coronaviruses, the host cell recognition of MERS-CoV by\nCD26 receptor is mediated by its surface anchored S\nglycoprotein [6,\n7]. This S glycoprotein has S1 and S2 subunits.\nS1 subunit contains RBD which mediates initial host cell\nrecognition whereas S2 subunit mediates membrane fusion \n[8,\n9].\n\nSeveral recent studies have revealed that the N-terminal 367-\n606 amino acid region of S glycoprotein of MERS-CoV is\nbound with human CD26 and produces significant immune\nresponse. This phenomenon suggests that the receptor binding\ncapacity of MERS-CoV lies in this particular region of S\nglycoprotein [10,\n11]. Considering these facts, our approach\nwas to choose this particular region of S glycoprotein for the\nprediction and identification of the potential T- and B-cell\nepitopes in this computational study.\n\nThe sequences of S glycoprotein were retrieved from two\ndatabases: NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology\nInformation) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and uniprot\n(http://www.uniprot.org/). These sequences belong to\ndiverse demographic distributions like Saudi Arabia, England,\nQatar, Spain, Germany, Jordan, and UAE with time ranges\nfrom 2012 to 2013.\n\nThe Clustal Omega software (version 1.2.1) was utilized to\ngenerate multiple sequence alignment for retrieved sequences\nwhich was the basis for determining the conservancy of MERS\nCoV RBD [12].\n\nDifferent tools available from the IEDB analysis resource\n(http://tools.immuneepitope.org/main/index.html) were\nused to evaluate the immunogenicity of MERS-CoV RBD. The\nNetCTL prediction method was utilized for identifying T-cell\nepitopes from this region [13,\n14]. The MHC class-I binding\nprediction tool was used to identify MHC class-I alleles for the\nfinal set of T-cell epitopes based on Stabilized Matrix Method\n(SMM) [15].\n\n\u201cProteasomal cleavage/TAP transport/MHC class I combined\npredictor\u201d was utilized for determining the overall score for\neach peptide's intrinsic capability to be considered as a T cell\nepitope (\nhttp://tools.immuneepitope.org/processing/) \n[15\u201317]. \nThe epitope conservancy analysis tool was utilized to\ncalculate the conservancy of the final set of epitopes within the\nsequences of S glycoprotein [18]. In addition to this, The\nProPred1 and SYFPEITHI databases were also employed to\nidentify the anchoring residues of the epitopes [19,\n20].\n\nThe 3D structure of MHC class-I molecule (HLA-C*12:03) was\nretrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (HLA-C*12:03;\nPDB ID: 2FSE) database (http://www.rcsb.org /pdb/home/\nhome.do). The 3D structure of the best epitope CYSSLILDY\n(see discussion section) was designed by using PEPstr peptide\ntertiary structure prediction server (http://www.imtech.res.in\n/raghava/pepstr/).\n\nThe AutoDock tools (ADT) from the MGL software package\n(version 1.5.6) and AutoDock vina (Vina, version 4.2) were\nused for molecular docking study [21,\n22]. At the beginning of\nthe docking study, both the 3D structures of protein (HLAC*\n12:03) and ligand (CYSSLILDY) were opened in ADT. For\nthe epitope to be bound at the binding groove of HLA-C*12:03,\nthe centre grid box parameter was set at 22.474, 5.416, 34.437\n\u00c5 in x, y and z directions respectively with 1.0 \u00c5 spacing. The\npoints were set at 40, 38, 52 \u00c5 in x, y and z directions\nrespectively. AutoDock tool was utilized to set the above\nparameters whereas AutoDock vina was applied for\nconducting docking experiment. Output files were visualized\nby PyMOL molecular visualization system (version: 1.5.0.3).\nAlong with this, the Immunodominant Determinant of human\ntype-2 collagen (PDB ID: 2FSE) was used as ligand to run\npositive control maintaining all the parameters as same as\ninitial docking of this study.\n\nThe B-cell epitope prediction tool from IEDB was used to\npredict the B-cell antigenicity of MERS-CoV RBD. The\nKolaskar and Tongaonkar method was employed for this\nprediction which can predict antigenic determinants with\napproximately 75% accuracy [23].\n\nAn illustration of the MERS-CoV RBD in complex with the\nhuman CD26 protein (DPP4) is given in Figure 1. A total of 54\nsequences of S glycoprotein were subjected to multiple\nsequence alignment. From the output of multiple sequence\nalignment of S glycoprotein, it was found that a peptide region\nof 367-606 amino acids remained conserved among all the\ngiven sequences (Figure 2A). Thus the above finding gives a\nconvincing affirmation that MERS-CoV RBD is a well\nconserved region.\n\n235 overlapping CTL peptides and 79 possible MHC-1 alleles\nwere predicted by NetCTL and MHC class-I binding\nprediction tool, respectively. The final set of epitopes and their\nrespective MHC class-I allele was generated on the basis of a\ntotal score \u2265 1 and the \u201chalf maximal inhibitory concentration\n(IC50)\u201d value \u2264 100. This final set includes only eight T-cell\nepitopes and a total of 19 MHC class-I alleles (Figure 2A &\nFigure 2B). A graphical presentation of the result predicted by\nthe NetCTL prediction tool is given in Figure 3. The\nimmunogenicity of final epitopes was also determined in terms\nof proteasome score, TAP score, MHC-I binding score and\nprocessing score. All of the eight T-cell epitopes demonstrated\n100% sequence conservancy within the given sequences of S\nglycoprotein which is summarized in Table 1 (See\nsupplementary material).\n\nThe designed epitope (CYSSLILDY) and experimental epitope\n(immunodominant determinant of human type-2 collagen;\nPDB ID: 2FSE) are displayed in Figure 3. AutoDock vina\npredicted the best conformer of CYSSLILDY epitope based on\nthe binding energy in kcal/mol unit. In our study, the best\nconformer of this epitope had the binding energy of -8.3\nkcal/mol which was very similar with that of the positive\ncontrol experiment (-7.5 kcal/mol). Among 9 residues in the\nepitope, only cysteine, serine and tyrosine (first, fourth and\nninth residue, respectively) showed the anchoring capacity\nand other six residues remained at the binding groove of HLAC *\n12:03 molecule. For both the designed and experimental\nepitopes at the binding groove of HLA-C*12:03, a comparative\nanalysis of their binding pattern is illustrated in \nFigure 4.\n\nThe graphical depiction of B-cell antigenicity of MERS-CoV\nRBD is in Figure 5. Average antigenic propensity for this\nregion is 1.050. Twelve antigenic determinants were found\nfrom this region which is presented in Table 2 (See\nsupplementary material).\n\nIn recent years, in silico approach has become handy in vaccine\ndesigning against deadly entities as it provides clue to select\ntarget protein sequence. Till date, there is no established\ntherapeutic solution or vaccination against MERS-CoV\ninfection. Several reports in recent years reveal that MERS-CoV\nproduces strong T-cell mediated immune responses in human\nbody, inspiring us to design T-cell epitope based peptide\nvaccine [24].\n\nTo be considered as a potent epitope, a peptide must contain\nseveral key properties like well conservancy, T- or B-cell\nprocessivity and good binding affinity for MHC alleles. In our\nstudy, the values for above mentioned parameters were found\nin favour of the finally chosen epitopes.\n\nIn this study we used NetCTL prediction tool for the primary\nscreening of the RBD of S glycoprotein of MERS-CoV for T-cell\nepitope prediction which is based on neural network\narchitecture. It predicts the epitopes on the basis of processing\nof peptide in vivo. It gives a total score for each epitopes by\nusing an algorithm integrating MHC-I binding, Transporter of\nAntigenic peptides (TAP) transport efficiency and proteasomal\ncleavage prediction [13,\n14].\n\nAmong eight T-cell epitopes, CYSSLILDY was the most\nsuccessful because it was found to have the maximum\ninteractions with different MHC class-I alleles which is a\nprinciple prerequisite for a potential epitope. In addition to\nthis, it was found that the peptide region of 408-452 amino acids\n\u201cNYNLTKLLSLFSVNDFTCSQISPAAIASNCYSSLILDYFSYPL\nS\u201d of S glycoprotein of MERS-CoV shows the highest B-cell\nantigenicity peak in antigenicity plot. Most importantly, we\nobserved that the best successful T-cell epitope CYSSLILDY is\nalso a part of the region which shows highest B-cell\nantigenicity peak, suggesting that it may stand as a competent\nchoice to be a universal vaccine component against MERSCoV,\nthe rapidly growing health concern.\n\nThe obtained results which identified the epitopes cover a\nsignificant number of strains with decent population coverage.\nTo exert cellular and humoral immunity, the computer aided\nresult has been found potential and expected to mount\nimmune response upon further in vivo and in vitro validation.\nThe step by step analysis and progression for maximum\npossible MHC coverage provides significant primary screening\nresult against this fatal virus.\n\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interests."}
