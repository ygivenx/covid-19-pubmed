{"title": "In-service training for health professionals to improve care of seriously ill newborns and children in low-income countries (Review)", "body": "Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study risk of bias and confidence in effect estimates (certainty of evidence) for each outcome using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). We described results and presented them in GRADE tables.\n\nWe identified no new studies in this update. Two randomised trials (which were included in the original review) met the review eligibility criteria. In the first trial, newborn resuscitation training compared with usual care improved provider performance of appropriate resuscitation (trained 66% vs usual care 27%, risk ratio 2.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75 to 3.42; moderate certainty evidence) and reduced inappropriate resuscitation (trained mean 0.53 vs usual care 0.92, mean difference 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.66; moderate certainty evidence). Effect on neonatal mortality was inconclusive (trained 28% vs usual care 25%, risk ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.48; N = 27 deaths; low certainty evidence). Findings from the second trial suggest that essential newborn care training compared with usual care probably slightly improves delivery room newborn care practices (assessment of breathing, preparedness for resuscitation) (moderate certainty evidence).\n\nIn-service neonatal emergency care courses probably improve health professionals' treatment of seriously ill babies in the short term. Further multi-centre randomised trials evaluating the effects of in-service emergency care training on long-term outcomes (health professional practice and patient outcomes) are needed.\n\nThis is the first update of the original Cochrane review, whose objective was to find out whether additional emergency care training programmes can improve the ability of health workers in poor countries to care for seriously ill newborns and children admitted to hospitals. Researchers at The Cochrane Collaboration searched for all studies that could answer this question and found two relevant studies.\n\nThe review authors suggest that giving health professionals in poor countries additional training in emergency care probably improves their ability to care for seriously ill newborns. We need additional high-quality studies, including studies in which health professionals are trained to care for seriously ill older children.\n\nIn poor countries, many babies and children with serious illnesses die even though they have been cared for in hospitals. One reason for this may be that health workers in these countries often are not properly trained to offer the care that these children need.\n\nIn poor countries, children often become seriously ill because of conditions such as pneumonia, meningitis and diarrhoea, and may need emergency care. For newborn babies, the most common reason for emergency care is too little oxygen to the baby during birth. If this goes on for too long, the person delivering the baby has to help the baby breathe, and sometimes has to get the baby's heart rate back to normal. This is called neonatal resuscitation.\n\nIn-service neonatal emergency care training versus usual care for healthcare professionals Population: nurses and midwives Setting: delivery room/theatre (Kenya) Intervention: 1-day newborn resuscitation training Comparison: usual care\n\nAbsolute effect* (95% CI) Relative effect (95% CI) \n\nIn low-income countries, most deaths among seriously ill children who come into contact with referral level health services occur within 48 hours of when they are seen (Berkley 2005) . It is possible that good quality immediate and effective care provided by health professionals could reduce these deaths (Nolan 2001). Provision of appropriate care however depends on the presence of skilled health personnel at the point of care delivery (WHO 2005) . To improve health workers' capacity to provide effective care for seriously ill newborns and children in low-income countries, various in-service training courses, based mainly on models of high-income countries, are proposed. This is the first update of the original review.\n\nSevere illness remains a leading cause of newborn and child deaths in low-income countries (LICs) (Liu 2012; Seale 2014). Major conditions contributing to severe illness include sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis and diarrhoea (Liu 2012; Seale 2014). Early recognition of severe illness with prevention of cardiorespiratory arrest through resuscitation represents a critical step towards reducing mortality and long-term disability in seriously ill newborns and children. However, the clinical diagnosis of severe illness can be difficult, as signs are often non-specific and deteriorate rapidly. Gove 1999; Molyneux 2006) . This course is specifically aimed at low-income countries and is intended to improve prompt identification and institution of life-saving emergency treatment for very ill children. The more general CDD and ARI programmes were developed by the WHO in 1980, in recognition of high childhood mortality due to diarrhoea/dehydration and pneumonia among very ill neonates and children; they focus on case management training rather than life support (Forsberg 2007; Pio 2003) . Although these courses concentrate on community-based or out-patient-based management, with good evidence for their success (Sazawal 2001), they also include guidance on management of very severe illness. These disease-specific training approaches were incorporated into the broader package of the IMCI strategy. Here the particular focus for management of the very ill child is the decision to provide prereferral care and referral to hospital. In addition to this, the WHO has developed a specific five-day course on hospital management of severe malnutrition (WHO 2002) .\n\nThe effectiveness of in-service training of healthcare professionals depends on changes in health worker practices, which, plausibly, should precede any impact on mortality or morbidity.\n\nIn-service training costs both time and money, for example, the cost of the two-day European Paediatric Life Support (EPLS) course is estimated to be about USD 190 per trainee in Kenya (personal communication with ME, 2009). Apart from the sometimes high costs of providing courses (often recovered in high-income countries with high course fees), attendance at such courses often means that important staff are absent from their normal duties with potential disruption to patient care and, for some, loss of personal income (Jabbour 1996) . Despite their high costs, emergency care courses remain a thriving enterprise in many high-income countries, as is reflected in their ever increasing number and variety (Jewkes 2003) . In the hope that they might improve the quality of care in low-and middle-income countries, considerable global efforts and investments have gone into further development, refinement and adaptation of these courses to meet the needs of individual countries (Baskett 2005 ). Yet despite these investments and the faith placed in them by many organisations and institutions, evidence of their effectiveness in improving treatment of seriously ill newborns and children remains unclear. Several studies on in-service emergency care training for newborns and children have been completed since our original review was published, in 2010. Therefore an updated review of the effectiveness of these courses is needed.\n\nTo assess the effects of in-service emergency care training on health professionals' treatment of seriously ill newborns and children in low-income countries.\n\nRandomised trials, non-randomised trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted-time-series studies were eligible for inclusion (EPOC 2014). We excluded community-based studies.\n\nQualified healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, midwives, physician assistants) in outpatient/hospital-based settings responsible for care of seriously ill newborns and children were eligible for inclusion. We excluded non-qualified healthcare providers (e.g. medical students/trainees, medical interns, community health workers). We did not exclude studies on the basis of their income classification (low, middle or high income).\n\nIn-service training courses aimed at changing health provider behaviour in the care of seriously ill newborns and children were eligible for inclusion (Table 1) .\n\n\u2022 Neonatal life support courses (e.g. NLS, NRP).\n\n\u2022 Paediatric life support courses (e.g. PALS, PLS).\n\n\u2022 Life support elements within the Integrated Management of Pregnancy and Childbirth (e.g. ENC).\n\n\u2022 Other in-service newborn and child health training courses aimed at recognition and management of seriously ill newborns and children (e.g. ETAT, CDD, ARI, malaria case management, training components of IMCI strategy).\n\nWe excluded studies of complex training interventions in which training was combined with and was impossible to separate from additional health system changes (e.g. improved staffing, health facility reorganisation).\n\nWe included studies only if they reported objectively measured health professional (in practice) performance outcomes (e.g. clinical assessment/diagnosis, recognition and management/referral of seriously ill newborn/child, prescribing practices).\n\nWe also considered the following outcomes when reported.\n\n\u2022 Participant outcomes (e.g. mortality, morbidity).\n\n\u2022 Health resource utilisation (e.g. drug use, laboratory tests).\n\n\u2022 Health services utilisation (e.g. length of hospital stay).\n\n\u2022 Other markers of clinical performance (e.g. simulated health worker performance in practice settings).\n\n\u2022 Training/implementation costs.\n\n\u2022 Impact on equity.\n\n\u2022 Adverse effects.\n\nWe excluded studies that reported only other markers of performance/simulations/skill testing done outside practice settings/ in classrooms (e.g. practicing/demonstrating resuscitation techniques using a dummy). We considered for inclusion simulations of emergency care in practice settings that were designed to reflect real practice.\n\nWe searched the following databases for related reviews.\n\n\u2022 Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) (2015, Issue 2), part of The Cochrane Library (www.cochranelibrary.com) (searched 24/02/2015).\n\n\u2022 Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (2015, Issue 1), part of The Cochrane Library (www.cochranelibrary.com) (searched 24/02/2015).\n\n\u2022 Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA) (2015, Issue 1), part of The Cochrane Library (www.cochranelibrary.com) (searched 24/02/2015).\n\nWe searched the following databases for primary studies.\n\n\u2022 Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 1), part of The Cochrane Library (www.cochranelibrary.com) (including the Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Register) (searched 24/02/2015).\n\n\u2022 MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, and MEDLINE daily, MEDLINE and OLDMEDLINE, 1946 to present, Ovid SP (searched 23/02/2015).\n\n\u2022 EMBASE, 1980 to 2015 Week 08, Ovid SP (searched 23/ 02/2015).\n\n\u2022 Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), 1981 to present, EBSCOHost (searched 24/02/ 2015).\n\n\u2022 Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), 1966 to present, ProQuest (searched 24/02/2015).\n\n\u2022 World Health Organization Library Information System (WHOLIS), WHO (searched 24/02/2015).\n\n\u2022 Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), VIrtual Health Library (VHL) (searched 24/02/ 2015).\n\n\u2022 Science Citation Index, 1975 to present; Social Sciences Citation Index, 1975 to present; Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science (searched 24/02/2015) for papers that cite included studies.\n\nWe developed search strategies for electronic databases using the methodological component of the EPOC search strategy combined with selected Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and free-text terms. We applied no date, language or publication status restrictions. See Appendix 1 for strategies used.\n\nWe also searched clinical trial registries (https://clinicaltrials.gov/, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, http://www.who.int/ictrp/en/), both searched 11/02/2014) and websites of relevant organisations (Helping Babies Breathe, http:/ /www.helpingbabiesbreathe.org/, searched 11/02/2014). We used a combination of search terms derived from the MEDLINE search strategy. In addition, we screened reference lists of related reviews.\n\nReview authors (NO and ME) independently screened the titles, abstracts and full texts of retrieved articles and applied the predefined study eligibility criteria to select studies. We resolved disagreements through discussion.\n\nReview authors (NO and ME) independently extracted the following data using a modified EPOC data collection tool (EPOC 2014). We resolved disagreements by discussion.\n\n\u2022 Study characteristics (e.g. study design, sample size, setting).\n\n\u2022 Participants (e.g. number of healthcare providers randomly assigned, number of practices performed).\n\n\u2022 Intervention (e.g. type and duration of training courses)/cointerventions.\n\n\u2022 Targeted health provider behaviour (e.g. resuscitation practices).\n\n\u2022 Outcome measures (e.g. proportion of providers with the event of interest in study groups).\n\nReview authors (NO and ME) independently assessed study risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (Higgins 2011). Quality domains assessed included allocation sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, completeness of participant follow-up, handling of incomplete outcome data, protection against selective outcome reporting and contamination. We classified findings into three categories: low (low risk of bias for all key quality domains), high (high risk of bias for one or more key domains) and unclear risk of bias (unclear risk of bias for one or more key domains). We did not exclude studies on the basis of their risk of bias.\n\nIncluded studies assessed different interventions and outcomes. Meta-analysis was therefore inappropriate. We undertook a structured synthesis of results. In Senarath 2007, a unit of analysis error occurred; hospitals were randomly assigned and performance at deliveries was analysed, without adjustment for clustering. In addition, outcomes in intervention and control groups were not directly compared (comparisons were made within comparison groups before and after the intervention). Re-analysis was possible for only one outcomepreparedness for resuscitation -for which baseline levels of resuscitation practices were comparable between study groups. In the re-analysis, we assessed training effect by computing mean differences in outcomes, using reported standard deviations to estimate standard errors. To account for clustering, we assumed an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.015 (with a design effect of 1.129) that was based on published data (Rowe 2002). Review authors (NO and ME) independently assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system (Guyatt 2008) . This approach classifies the certainty of evidence (defined as 'the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association is correct') into one of four categories ('high', 'moderate', 'low' or 'very low'). We resolved disagreements on certainty ratings by discussion. We did not exclude studies on the basis of their GRADE certainty ratings; we took into account the certainty of evidence when synthesising overall findings. We report the results of certainty assessments in the 'Summary of findings tables' section.\n\nIn the original review, 2480 references were identified. Of these, 2334 articles were excluded following a review of titles and abstracts. Reasons for exclusion included inappropriate study designs/interventions/outcomes; enrolment of trainee/community health workers; and enrolment of non-paediatric patients. The full texts of 146 papers were retrieved for detailed eligibility assessment. Of these, eight studies were identified as potentially meeting the review inclusion criteria. Six were subsequently excluded. Overall, two studies were included: Opiyo 2008 and Senarath 2007. In this review update, we identified a total of 4768 articles. We excluded 4754 articles after a review of titles and abstracts. We retrieved the full texts of 14 articles for detailed assessment. Of these, 14 articles were excluded because of ineligible study design or setting (n = 7 studies), participants (n = 1 study) and outcomes (n = 6 studies). We identified no ongoing studies. No new studies met all of the review eligibility criteria. The study flow diagram is presented in Figure 1 .\n\nBoth studies were randomised trials done in delivery rooms/theatres in Kenya (Opiyo 2008) and Sri Lanka (Senarath 2007). Healthcare providers were nurses in Opiyo 2008 and were mixed (doctors, nurses, midwives) in Senarath 2007. Targeted behaviours included newborn resuscitation (Opiyo 2008) and general management/preparation and conduct of delivery care for newborns (Senarath 2007) . Postintervention data were collected over a period of 50 days in Opiyo 2008 and three months in Senarath 2007. Individual healthcare providers (n = 83) were randomly assigned in Opiyo 2008, and hospitals (n = 5) were randomly assigned in Senarath 2007. Both studies were adequately powered (90%) for primary outcomes. Neither study examined training/implementation costs. Opiyo 2008 assessed the effects of one-day newborn resuscitation training on health worker resuscitation practices in a maternity hospital in Kenya. The course, which was adapted from the UK Resuscitation Council,presented an A (airway), B (breathing), C (circulation) approach to resuscitation and laid down a clear step-by-step strategy for the first minutes of resuscitation at birth. Training included focused lectures and practical scenario sessions in which infant manikins were used. Participants were provided a course manual two weeks before training for self learning. Participants were randomly allocated to receive early training (n = 28) or late training (control group, n = 55). Data were collected on 97 and 115 resuscitation episodes over seven weeks after early and late training, respectively. Senarath 2007 assessed the effects of four-day essential newborn care training on health provider practices in hospitals in Sri Lanka. The course was adapted from the WHO Training Modules on Essential Newborn Care and Breastfeeding. Participants were provided teaching aids on newborn care and resuscitation. Training comprised lectures, demonstrations, hands-on training and small group discussions. Hospitals were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 2 hospitals) and control groups (n = 3 hospitals). The main sample for data collection by exit interview included 446 mother/newborn pairs before intervention and 446 pairs after intervention (223 each in intervention and control groups). These exit interview data were not relevant to the topic of this review. Direct observations of delivery practices were made on a subsample consisting of 96 healthcare providers (48 before and 48 after the intervention). Postintervention data collection commenced three months after training.\n\nWe eventually excluded 20 studies that initially met the review eligibility criteria. These are listed in the Characteristics of excluded studies table. Six studies were excluded in the original review: Bryce 2005, a non-randomised controlled study on health facility IMCI training, was excluded, as the training intervention was combined with and was impossible to separate from concurrent district health strengthening activities (skills reinforcement through supervised clinical practice). El-Arifeen 2004, a cluster-randomised trial on the effects of IMCI training on quality of care, was excluded, as data on referral rate (appropriate health worker response to an encounter with a seriously ill child and our outcome of interest) were not reported for seriously ill children. Gouws 2004, a clusterrandomised trial on the effects of IMCI training on health worker antibiotic use, was excluded, as no baseline assessment of outcomes was performed. Nadel 2000, an intervention study of periodic mock resuscitations combined with an eight-hour resuscitation course, was excluded, as it lacked a concurrent comparison group/ used a historical control group. Two further studies were excluded, as they enrolled only apparently well children (Pelto 2004) or those with mild acute respiratory infection episodes (Ochoa 1996) . In this update, we excluded 14 studies because of ineligible designs (non-randomised designs, uncontrolled before-after designs, community-based settings) (n = 6 studies) and inappropriate outcome measures/simulated provider practices (n = 8 studies).\n\nBoth randomised trials had serious limitations. In Opiyo 2008, allocation sequence generation, concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, follow-up of health providers and reporting of outcome measures were adequate (however, details about allocation sequence generation and concealment were not reported in the article). Potential cross-group contamination in the trial cannot be excluded. In Senarath 2007, outcome data were completely reported and the study was adequately protected against contamination and selective outcome reporting. However, methods of allocation sequence generation and concealment were not reported. Baseline differences in health providers and outcomes were evident between study groups. Blinding of outcome assessment was inadequate, and the presence of a 'unit of analysis error' added further uncertainty regarding the results.\n\nSee: Summary of findings for the main comparison; Summary of findings 2 In Opiyo 2008, newborn resuscitation training improved health workers' resuscitation practices (trained 66% vs control 27%; risk ratio (RR) 2.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75 to 3.42) (moderate certainty evidence). Training also reduced the frequency of inappropriate/harmful resuscitation practices (trained 0.53 vs control 0.92; mean difference (MD) 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.66; Appendix 2) (moderate certainty evidence). Effects on neonatal mortality were inconclusive (trained 0.28 vs usual care 0.25; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.48; N = 27 deaths; Figure 2 ) (low certainty evidence). In Senarath 2007, assessment of breathing of the newborn at birth and four of the five components of essential newborn care practices were improved in the intervention group after training, but it was possible to re-analyse the data to compare intervention and control groups and to adjust for clustering for only one outcome: preparedness for resuscitation. Findings suggest that essential newborn care training probably slightly improves resuscitation preparedness (mean percentage change 8.83%, 95% CI 6.41% to 11.25%; Figure 3 and Figure 4 ) (moderate certainty evidence). \n\nIn-service neonatal emergency care training versus standard care for healthcare professionals Group grades of evidence * The risk WITHOUT the intervention is based on the control group risk.

Findings from the two included studies suggest a benefi-cial effect on health provider outcomes (resuscitation practices, assessment of breathing, resuscitation preparedness) in the short term. However, effects on neonatal mortality were inconclusive (although the only study that reported this outcome was under-powered to detect a mortality effect). Even though both included studies reported improvement in health provider practices after training, a generalisable conclusion of effectiveness cannot be inferred given the sparse data available and differences between training interventions and outcomes examined.\n\nReported benefits should be interpreted with caution. First, in Opiyo 2008, assessment of outcomes was conducted immediately after training for a short period (50 days). Therefore instantaneous improvement in provider performance could have been expected. Clinical skills have been shown to 'decay' over time, with as much as a 50% reduction in appropriate practice (as assessed in classroom simulations) within six months of intense training (McKenna 1985 The duration of training courses was varied (one-day vs four-day course). Apart from the clear effect on costs, training duration may modify their impact: One review (Rowe 2008) (n = 2 studies) found marginal effectiveness of standard IMCI training (\u2265 11 days) compared with shortened IMCI training (five to 11 days). The complexity of the targeted behaviour may also modify training effects: Practices such as holding the baby upside during resuscitation may be easier to change than complex ones such as performing bag-valve-mask resuscitation. In Opiyo 2008, the teaching strategy consisted of focused lectures and practical scenario sessions using an infant manikin, and in Senarath 2007, the strategy involved lectures, demonstrations, hands-on training and small group discussions. The format of training courses could influence their effect: One review found mixed interactive and didactic/lecture-based educational meetings to be more effective than didactic meetings or interactive meetings (Forsetlund 2009).\n\nThe limited available evidence can be explained by several factors. First, a large number of studies were excluded on the basis of weak design (lack of appropriate controls, retrospective surveys). Most of the available evidence is therefore unreliable because of high risk of bias. Second, the lack of rigorous studies could be due to design and ethical challenges in the evaluation of educational interventions in practice settings. Desirable features such as protec-tion against contamination cannot be fully achieved within routine clinical settings. In addition, random assignment of health providers and sick babies to a control arm and observation of practices performed by untrained providers raise clear ethical concerns. Third, effective sample sizes will always be difficult to achieve, as severe illness episodes and resuscitation events remain relatively uncommon events in practice. Large multi-centre studies with relatively long observation periods would be needed to effectively assess the effects of emergency care courses. Apart from high costs, such studies would have to contend with the difficulty of securing continued availability and participation of health providers.\n\nFindings of the present review are consistent with those of previous reviews (Jabbour 1996; Rowe 2008), which found limited evidence on the effectiveness of in-service neonatal and paediatric emergency care courses.\n\nThe findings of this review suggest that in-service neonatal care courses probably improve health professional practices in caring for seriously ill newborns. Decisions to scale up these courses in low-income countries must be based on consideration of costs and logistics associated with their implementation, including the need for adequate numbers of skilled instructors, appropriate locally adapted training materials and the availability of basic resuscitation equipment.\n\nLarge pragmatic multi-centre randomised trials (with appropriate controls and adequate randomisation procedures) evaluating the impact of emergency care in-service training on long-term outcomes (health professional practices and patient outcomes) are needed (given the current uncertainty on how long short-term benefits are retained, particularly in settings in which they are used infrequently).\n\nSuch trials should:\n\n\u2022 involve direct head-to-head comparison of courses of varied length (e.g. one-day vs four-day courses);\n\n\u2022 aim to include children (in both out-patient and hospital settings);\n\n\u2022 be preceded by pilot cost impact evaluation studies (given current uncertainty regarding the economic consequences of inservice emergency care training); and\n\n\u2022 collect data on resource use and cost of training implementation (to optimise appropriate policy decisions regarding which interventions are worthy of investment).\n\nTo facilitate implementation and replication, studies should provide sufficient detail regarding their content (e.g. need for equipment, teamwork) and format (e.g. small group interactive vs lecture, hands-on skills with dummies). Further studies are needed to determine optimal refresher training intervals for in-service emergency care courses.\n\nWe would like to thank Marit Johansen for help with the literature searches and Andy Oxman for advice on the update process.
