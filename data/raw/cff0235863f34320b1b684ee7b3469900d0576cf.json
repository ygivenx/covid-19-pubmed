{"title": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance-Assisted Prediction of Secondary Structure for RNA: Incorporation of Direction-Dependent Chemical Shift Constraints", "body": "RNA is a central biomolecule involved in many cellular functions, including synthesizing proteins, regulating gene expression, catalyzing reactions, and storing genetic data in many viruses. 1 Therefore, knowledge of RNA structure can lead to the discovery of causes and cures of many diseases. Once sequence is known, the first step in determining RNA structure is defining the secondary structure, i.e., base pairing. This level of structure is used for many applications, including using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to determine 3D structure, 2\u22124 designing therapeutics, 5 and providing insights into functional mechanisms 6 and evolution. 7\u221210 Methods for predicting RNA secondary structure include comparative sequence analysis 7,11\u221213 and minimization of free energy predicted on the basis of thermodynamic parameters. 14\u221218 The latter method is \u223c70% accurate when predicting secondary structure from a single sequence, 19, 20 but prediction methods that integrate sequence comparison typically give better than 85% average accuracy. 21\u221226 A pseudoknot is a type of RNA secondary structure in which nucleotides in a loop region pair with nucleotides outside of where the loop was closed. Formally, a pseudoknot occurs if there are two base pairs with indices i paired to j and k paired to l, with positions i < k < j < l. Base pairs forming pseudoknots are the most difficult to predict, and most popular programs do not allow pseudoknots. Pseudoknots, however, have important biological roles. 27\u221233 The lack of thermodynamic data for pseudoknots compounds the difficulty of accurately predicting them by calculating free energy changes. 34, 35 To improve the accuracy of predicting secondary structure, techniques that employ experimental data have been developed. Chemical mapping constraints 20 and/or restraints 36\u221238 can be used to identify nucleotides not in Watson\u2212Crick base pairs. NMR constraints identify nucleotides in Watson\u2212Crick and GU pairs. 39 Crystallization of RNA is challenging. 40, 41 Therefore, many RNA 3D structures have been determined by NMR, which also provides insight into dynamics. NMR-Assisted Prediction of Secondary Structure (NAPSS) utilizes NMR-derived constraints in conjunction with a thermodynamic folding algorithm to reduce the potential folding space of an RNA molecule and provide some initial chemical shift assignments. 39 Imino proton 2D NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) is used to identify helices of stacked canonical base pairs. The user enters constraints from sequential imino proton walks into a program that recursively searches for structures containing matching helical walks. For the set of structures in which all constraints are matched, the program refolds unconstrained regions and calculates the folding free energy change of the entire structure. The putative structures are ranked by predicted folding free energy change. The helical walk constraints, however, do not provide any information about the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 strand direction of the base pair stacks. That is, the directionality of the set of stacks along the sequence is unknown. Thus, NAPSS often identifies a large set of possible structures that satisfy all of the stacking constraints.\n\nChemical shifts of protons in base pairs are affected by the identity of neighboring bases. 42\u221244 Direction-dependent trends for chemical shifts of base pair stacks were mostly identified from the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB) 45 and by measuring spectra for some model duplexes with GU pairs. Here, we report direction-dependent trends for GH1, UH3, and UH5 of GU wobble pairs, AH2, UH3, and UH5 of AU pairs, and GH1 of GC pairs. An expanded NAPSS algorithm, NAPSS-CS, is also provided that uses these spectroscopic properties to constrain predictions of RNA secondary structure ( Figure 1 ).\n\nWhile the NAPSS-CS algorithm is intended for RNA secondary structure prediction, the approach can be generalized to self-assembling polymers in which structure allows NMR walks and thermodynamic rules are known. This includes selfassembling DNA structures and nucleic acid mimics with different backbones and \"bases\" for which chemical modification reagents may not be available. 46\u221249 The algorithm may also facilitate determination of secondary structure when more than one structure is present and the structures are in slow exchange on the NMR time scale.\n\nOligoribonucleotide Preparation and NMR Spectroscopy. To further explore the dispersion of resonances for GU pairs, whose chemical shifts are underrepresented in the literature compared to AU and GC pairs, NOESY and TOCSY spectra were measured for the following sequences to determine GH1, UH3, UH5, and AH2 chemical shifts: r(AGGCUU) 2 , r(AGUCGAUU) 2 , r(CUGGCUAG) 2 , r(CAG-UCGAUUG) 2 , r(CCGAAUUUGG) 2 , r(CGGAAUUUCG) 2 , r(CGGAUAUUCG) 2 , r(CGUGAUUACG) 2 , r(CUGGAUU-CAG) 2 , r(GAGAGCUUUC) 2 , r(GAGGAUCUUC) 2 , and r(GUGAAUUUAC) 2 . Imino proton 1D spectra for these sequences have been published. 50 All oligoribonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., except for r(GUGAAUUUAC) 2 , which was synthesized by M. Serra (Allegheny College, Meadville, PA) using standard phosphoramidite chemistry. Oligoribonucleotides were dissolved in 300 \u03bcL of 80 mM NaCl, 18.8 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 1.16 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , and 0.02 mM EDTA at pH 6.0. To provide a lock signal, 15 \u03bcL of D 2 O was then added. NMR spectra were acquired with a Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer. A 35 ms mixing time was used for 2D TOCSY spectra, and 100 and 400 ms mixing times were used for 2D 1 H\u2212 1 H NOESY spectra. For 2D spectra, water signals were suppressed with a WATERGATE-style pulse with flipback. 51, 52 2D spectra were processed with NMRPipe 53 and resonances assigned with SPARKY. 54 Proton chemical shifts were referenced to a temperaturedependent water shift (eq 1), where T is temperature in kelvin measured at pH 5.5. 55 2,2-Dimethylsilapentate-5-sulfonic acid was used as an external reference standard for water. A predicted pair, i to j, was considered correct if the accepted structure contained a pair from i to j, i \u00b1 1 to j, or i to j \u00b1 1. This accounts for the fact that comparative analysis cannot always resolve the exact pairing and that pairs can be dynamic. 19 RNA Preparation and NMR Spectroscopy. A plasmid construct containing the sequence for human accelerated region 1 (HAR1) used by Beniaminov et al. 9 was provided by A. Krol of the Institut de Biologie Mole\u0107ulaire et Cellulaire.\n\nThe plasmid was amplified in and purified from Escherichia coli competent cells using standard plasmid preparation protocols. The purified plasmid was linearized overnight by SmaI restriction endonuclease (New England BioLabs) at 25\u00b0C. RNA was transcribed from the linearized plasmid with T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kits (New England BioLabs), with 1 \u03bcg of plasmid per 20 \u03bcL reaction mixture. After transcription mixtures had been incubated for 12 h at 37\u00b0C, 5 \u03bcL of 100 mM EDTA was added to stop reactions. A sample with 15 N-and 13 C-labeled rGTP and rUTP (Sigma-Aldrich) was synthesized with a similar protocol.\n\nHAR1 samples were purified with FPLC. 56 FPLC fractions were concentrated and exchanged into NMR buffer with Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units (EMD Millipore). NMR buffer consisted of 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM NaH 2 PO 4 / NaHPO 4 , and 0.05 mM Na 2 EDTA (pH 6.25). Each sample was placed in a susceptibility-matched Shigemi NMR A pUC19 plasmid containing an insert for a 75 nt sequence for the Bombyx mori R2 retrotransposon pseudoknot was constructed and amplified with standard plasmid purification protocols (see the Supporting Information for the plasmid construct). This construct differs from the 74 nt construct previously studied with NMR 39 by addition of the wild-type 3\u2032 terminal C. The plasmid was linearized with NheI restriction endonuclease at 37\u00b0C prior to in vitro transcription. Unlabeled and 13 C-and 15 N-labeled rGTP and rUTP samples were transcribed, purified with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and extracted from gels with electroelution. Purified RNAs were exchanged into NMR buffer (see ref 39) , concentrated with centrifugal filter units, and added to a Shigemi NMR tube. D 2 O was added to provide a lock signal.\n\nNMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 600 MHz NMR spectrometer. NOESY spectra were acquired for the unlabeled HAR1 sample with mixing times of 125 and 250 ms at 25\u00b0C and 60 ms at 15\u00b0C. A 15 N\u2212 1 H HSQC spectrum was acquired for the labeled HAR1 sample at 25\u00b0C. Relevant acquisition parameters are listed in Table S1 . NOESY spectra were acquired for the unlabeled 75 nt B. mori R2 retrotransposon pseudoknot with a mixing time of 200 ms at 25\u00b0C. A 15 N\u2212 1 H HSQC spectrum was acquired for the labeled B. mori R2 retrotransposon pseudoknot sample at 25\u00b0C.\n\nImino Proton Distances in PDB Helices. Adjacent canonical base pairs and therefore potential helices can be identified from NOEs between imino protons separated by <5 \u00c5. A database of imino proton distances between doublets of canonical base pairs was assembled from 3D structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). 57 Distances were obtained from nonredundant X-ray structures with a resolution no larger than 2 \u00c5, 58 to which hydrogens were added with the REDUCE program 59 and then averaged for each doublet of canonical pairs. For doublets with at least one GU pair, G/G, G/U, and/ or U/U, imino proton distances between adjacent base pairs were averaged separately, although the 5\u2032G-5\u2032U and 3\u2032G-3\u2032U distances were averaged together for 5\u2032GG3\u2032/3\u2032UU5\u2032. A separate set of imino proton distances for each doublet was obtained from NMR structures. Imino distances between doublets adjacent to loops, bulges, and helix termini were not considered because the terminal or closing base pairs may be dynamic.\n\nMost average distances from the X-ray and NMR structures agreed within 0.3 \u00c5 (Table 1 ). In X-ray structures, 26 interbase average imino proton distances were <5 \u00c5, thus allowing \"imino proton walks\" to identify helices. 60 The exceptions were 5\u2032UA/ 3\u2032AU, 5\u2032UG/3\u2032AU, 5\u2032UG/3\u2032GU, and G to U in X-ray structures of 5\u2032CG/3\u2032GU. Thus, helices with these doublets may not be completely constrained by NMR data. In published NMR spectra, however, an NOE between H3 of uracils of 5\u2032UA/3\u2032AU was observed for a human R/G stem-loop 61 and a hairpin stem from Yersinia enterocolitica. 62 In contrast, a 64 have an NOE between either imino proton of the GU pair and UH3 of the AU pair, but these NOEs were not observed in the spectrum of r(GUGAAUUUAC) 2 reported here. For the 5\u2032CG/3\u2032GU doublet, an NOE was observed between H3 of U and H1 of the 5\u2032 G in NMR spectra of a mutant of an element of the 3\u2032 UTR of turnip crinkle virus 65 and a domain of medaka telomerase CR4/5. 66 Sometimes spin diffusion will produce imino\u2212imino proton NOEs even if the imino protons are separated by >5 \u00c5. 60 Thus, complete helical walks are more likely to be observed than expected for the distances in Table 1 .\n\nSpectral Analysis of Duplexes with GU Pairs. To expand the database for GU pairs, exchangeable protons of short duplexes were assigned from NOESY spectra and the nonexchangeable H5 and H6 protons of C and U were assigned from TOCSY spectra (Tables S2\u2212S13). CH5\u2212H41/42 crosspeaks in NOESY spectra differentiated C from U in the TOCSY spectra and initiated assignment of proton resonances. Imino protons were identified as those of GU, GC, or AU pairs based largely on their positions in the imino fingerprint regions, from 10 to 12 ppm for GH1 and UH3 with a strong GH1/UH3 cross-peak for GU pairs, from 11 to 13.5 ppm for GH1 in GC pairs, and from 13 to 15 ppm for UH3 in AU pairs. 60 Aromatic proton assignments were confirmed with sequential aromatic walks. In A-form RNA, H1\u2032 of a residue forms NOE contacts with its own H6 or H8 base proton and that of its 3\u2032 base, allowing sequential assignments. 60 H2 of adenosine has an intrastrand cross-peak to H1\u2032 of its 3\u2032 residue and an interstrand cross-peak to H1\u2032 of the residue 3\u2032 of the base to which it is paired. While NMR spectra for all duplexes used in this study were assigned with similar methods, an example of the process for r(GAGGAUCUUC) 2 is given below. Two others are given in the Supporting Information.\n\n2D NOESY spectra for r(GAGGAUCUUC) 2 were obtained with mixing times of 100 and 400 ms at 5 and 20\u00b0C, respectively. The G3 H1 and U8 H3 protons were assigned according to their positions in the imino region of the 100 ms spectrum ( Figure 2 ). G4 H1 was identified by its cross-peaks to U8 H3 and G3 H1, while G1 H1 displays a weak resonance due to exchange with water. H3 of U6 was differentiated from U9 by its cross-peak to G4 H1. H5 to H6 peaks corresponding to C7 and C10 were differentiated by cross-peaks from the former's H41 and H42 to G4H1. Remaining aromatic proton and H1\u2032 assignments were made with the 400 ms spectrum as described above (Figure 2 ). The H1\u2032 assignments of U6 and C7 were confirmed by NOE contacts to A5 H2, while those of G3 and C10 were confirmed by NOE contacts to A2 H2. Database. NOEs from imino proton resonances provide identification of intrabase pair resonances for H5 of C and U and H2 of A. 60 A database of such NMR chemical shifts was assembled for 78 GU wobble pairs, 292 AU pairs, and 490 GC pairs flanked on both sides by at least one canonical base pair and categorized according to the identities and orientations of the flanking canonical pairs. Most of the structures were 10\u221240 nt long and contained stem-loops, while a few were completely double-stranded RNA. Literature data were mostly obtained from the BMRB. 45 Chemical shifts determined for GH1, UH3, and UH5 protons of GU pairs, AH2, UH3, and UH5 protons of AU pairs, and GH1 protons of GC pairs on the basis of oligoribonucleotide spectra reported here were consistent with existing data. The expanded database showed strong sequencedependent patterns, which were used to determine chemical shift ranges that identify the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction of base pair triplets centered on GU, AU, and GC pairs ( Table 2) .\n\nFor GU pairs, a 2D plot of UH3 versus GH1 chemical shifts ( Figure 3 ) revealed well-defined clusters for 5\u2032RGY3\u2032 and 5\u2032YGR3\u2032, but 5\u2032RGR3\u2032 and 5\u2032YGY3\u2032 regions overlap, where R and Y represent purines (G or A) and pyrimidines (C or U), respectively. A 2D plot of UH5 versus GH1 chemical shifts contained well-defined clusters corresponding to 5\u2032RGY3\u2032, 5\u2032YGR3\u2032, and 5\u2032YGY3\u2032, but not 5\u2032RGR3\u2032 due to overlap with the 5\u2032YGR3\u2032 region ( Figure 3 ). Thus, if triplets have a central GU pair, then GH1, UH3, and UH5 chemical shifts often reveal the direction of the helix (Figures 3 and 4) .\n\nFor AU pairs, 2D plots of AH2 versus UH3 chemical shifts ( Figure 5 ) revealed defined clusters corresponding to 5\u2032RAY3\u2032 Figure 5 . Chemical shift patterns for AU pairs. AH2 vs UH3 (top), UH5 vs UH3 (middle), and UH5 vs AH2 (bottom) colored according to triplet type. For each triplet type, R is purine (A or G) and Y is pyrimidine (C or U). Circled points represent chemical shifts not previously reported in the literature. Colored boxes are chemical shift ranges used as direction-dependent constraints for triplets with the same color points. Apparent overlaps in these plots are resolved by including a third chemical shift ( Figure 6 ). . Chemical shift patterns for GU pairs. UH5 vs UH3 vs GH1 chemical shifts colored according to triplet type. and 5\u2032YAR3\u2032, but the 5\u2032RAR3\u2032 region overlaps with 5\u2032YAY3\u2032. A 2D plot of UH3 versus UH5 chemical shifts contained welldefined clusters corresponding to 5\u2032RAY3\u2032 and 5\u2032YAY3\u2032, but the 5\u2032RAR3\u2032 region overlaps with 5\u2032YAR3\u2032. Thus, if triplets have a central AU pair, then UH3, AH2, and UH5 chemical shifts often reveal the direction of the helix (Figures 5 and 6 ).\n\nFor GC pairs flanked by canonical base pairs, a plot of the distribution of GH1 chemical shifts (Figure 7) showed that no GC pairs in the 5\u2032RGY3\u2032 direction have a GH1 chemical shift below 12.40 ppm, whereas no GC pairs in the 5\u2032YGR3\u2032 direction have a chemical shift above 13.10 ppm. Thus, if triplets have a central GC pair, then a GH1 chemical shift below 12.40 ppm eliminates the 5\u2032RGY3\u2032 direction and a shift above 13.10 ppm eliminates the 5\u2032YGR3\u2032 direction.\n\nNAPSS-CS Algorithm. The NAPSS-CS program identifies helices from a sequence by applying NMR constraints to a dynamic programming algorithm (Figure 8 ). This algorithm generates a free energy dot plot for a given sequence and recursively searches it for helices or sets of helices that fully match helical walk constraints from NMR. As in the previous version, 39 NAPSS-CS considers imino walks across singlenucleotide bulges and also coaxial stacks if the helices are not in separate pseudoknots. In NAPSS-CS, experimental chemical shifts for GH1, UH3, and UH5 in GU pairs, AH2, UH3, and UH5 in AU pairs, and GH1 in GC pairs can be input, which may define the orientation of base pairs in helices (Table 2) .\n\nTo reduce the search space, NAPSS-CS looks for the dot plot with the minimal number of pairs needed to find at least one complete match to all the helices revealed by NMR. Starting with the dot plot with pairs in the predicted most stable structure based only on thermodynamics, the number of pairs in the dot plot is increased by allowing base pairs found in structures generated at less favorable free energy changes. The allowed free energy difference between the predicted most favorable free energy change and that used as a cutoff for finding new potential base pairs is gradually increased in 1% increments until there is at least one match for all of the helices revealed by NMR.\n\nChemical exchange with water may prevent detection of imino protons of terminal base pairs and/or NOEs from those protons to imino protons of adjacent base pairs from being identified in NMR spectra and included in imino walk constraints. Therefore, the program extends matched helices to canonical base pairs that can stack on the matched helices. For every extended match set, NAPSS-CS forbids alternative pairings for the nucleotides in the set, uses a dynamic programming algorithm to fold the RNA into a secondary structure by free energy minimization, and then re-forms the base pairs from the match set if they have not already been reformed by the dynamic programming algorithm. Because nucleotides are not allowed in matched base pairs to base pair . Distribution of GH1 chemical shifts for GC pairs colored according to triplet type. For each triplet type, R is purine (A or G) and Y is pyrimidine (C or U). No GH1 chemical shifts from 11.31 to 11.50 ppm were found for GC pairs. to any nucleotide other than its matched partner, helices that are pseudoknotted once the matched base pairs are added are allowed to form. 67 Similar to the ShapeKnots algorithm, 38 NAPSS-CS fills in single or tandem mismatches and removes isolated pairs. The latter eliminates possible nonsensical pseudoknots. NAPSS-CS then calculates the folding free energy for every structure with the extended matches still intact. The free energy change for nonpseudoknotted secondary structures is calculated with the INN-HB model. 68, 69 Free energy changes for structures with pseudoknots are calculated by adding three energy terms: (a) the free energy change of the structure with the pseudoknot removed (maximizing the number of remaining base pairs) 70 using the INN-HB model, (b) the energy of the helix(es) that was removed when breaking the pseudoknot, calculated with the INN-HB model (without intermolecular initiation or any loop free energy changes), and (c) a pseudoknot energy penalty introduced in the ShapeKnots algorithm. 38, 71 If available, additional constraints or restraints can be used to further reduce the folding space. These include restraints from SHAPE and other mapping experiments or pairing constraints that can be derived, for example, from sequence comparison.\n\nApplication of NAPSS-CS to HAR1 and B. mori R2 Retrotransposon RNAs Illustrates the Method. HAR1 is a rapidly evolving noncoding RNA discovered in the brains of chimpanzees and humans. 8 Two secondary structures were initially proposed for HAR1, but NMR spectra 10 confirmed the secondary structure proposed by Beniaminov et al. 9 (Figure 9 ). To expand on published NMR spectra, new spectra were measured for HAR1 ( Figure 10 and Figures S3\u2212S5) . NOESY and 15 N\u2212 1 H HSQC spectra (Figure 10 and Figures S3 and S4 ) acquired at 25\u00b0C revealed 17 G and 8 U imino peaks, corresponding to 15 GC pairs, 6 AU pairs, and 2 GU pairs. An additional AU and GU pair was identified in a NOESY spectrum acquired at 15\u00b0C ( Figure S5 ). These data are consistent with seven imino proton walks (Figures 9 and 10 and Figures S3\u2212S5) . The imino proton chemical shift data from this work (Table S14 ) agree well with those reported by Ziegeler et al. 10 Imino proton resonances not identified in this work that Ziegeler et al. 10 assigned only in fragments of the fulllength construct are for G1, G48, and U109. These resonances were likely difficult to assign in the full-length construct because Figure 10 . NMR spectra of human HAR1 showing imino proton walks for helix P1 (see Figure 9 for the secondary structure). The top spectrum is a 1 H\u2212 1 H NOESY spectrum acquired at 25\u00b0C with a 125 ms mixing time. Colored lines depict imino proton walks for helix P1 and correspond to base pairs in Figure 9 with the same colors. Colored dots represent base pair type (red for GC and blue for AU). Sequences of dots for imino proton walks are in the bottom right of the spectrum. Blue and green boxes around sequences of dots correspond to blue and green base pairs in Figure 9 . The bottom spectrum is a 15 N\u2212 1 H HSQC spectrum acquired at 25\u00b0C. Figure 9 . Secondary structure of human HAR1. Colored base pairs correspond to imino proton walks identified from NMR spectra ( Table 3) . Residue numbering in the structure reported in this work is shifted by three residues relative to the consensus sequence. 9 they exchange with solvent protons in solvent-accessible environments: G1 and U109 are located at the end of helices, and G48 is in a GA pair. Imino proton resonances that Ziegeler et al. 10 did not assign in the full-length construct but were identified in this work are for G19, G30, G44, G49, G51, U79, U80, and G104 (Table S14 ). On the basis of the secondary structure shown in Figure 9 , P2 and P4 were missing expected imino signals and the two pairs assigned to P4 could be observed only at a reduced temperature (15\u00b0C) and a reduced mixing time (60 ms). These observations suggest that P2 and P4 may be unstable and/or dynamic. Constraints used for HAR1 are listed in Table 3 .\n\nThe 75 nt B. mori R2 retrotransposon pseudoknot ( Figure 11 ) has NMR spectra that agree well with those of a 74 nt construct ( Figure 11 ) originally used to identify the same pseudoknot. NOESY and 15 N\u2212 1 H HSQC spectra (Figures S6\u2212S9) acquired at 25\u00b0C revealed imino resonances corresponding to 20 GC pairs, 4 AU pairs, and 1 GU pair. These data provided six imino Figure 11 . Pseudoknotted structures used to benchmark NAPSS-CS. Colored base pairs correspond to imino proton walks identified from literature NMR spectra (Tables S16\u2212S24) . Table 3 . NMR Constraints Used To Predict the Structure of HAR1 a a Colors correspond to those in the secondary structure of Figure 9 and the imino proton walks shown in Figure 10 . Chemical shifts are submitted to NAPSS-CS as shown on the left, and base pairs predicted by NAPSS-CS are shown on the right. Integers 5, 6, and 7 represent AU, GC, and GU pairs, respectively. For GU pairs, numbers in parentheses are chemical shifts of GH1, UH3, and UH5, respectively. For AU pairs, numbers in parentheses are chemical shifts of AH2, UH3, and UH5, respectively. For GC pairs, the first number in parentheses is the chemical shift of GH1. For GU and AU pairs, zero means an unavailable chemical shift. For GC pairs, the second two zeros are placeholders for absent chemical shift constraints. Chemical shifts (Table S14) proton walks (Figure 11 and Figures S6\u2212S9) . One walk is new because G32 is able to pair with C75 in the 75-mer ( Figure 11 and Figure S8 ). Unlike in the spectra of the 74 nt construct, 39 an NOE from G13 to G27 was not observed in the spectrum of the 75 nt construct, possibly because its sample concentration was lower than for the 74 nt construct. This reduced a previous walk of 5 bp to two separate walks of 3 and 2 bp. Constraints used for the 75-mer B. mori R2 pseudoknot are provided in Table S17 . While not used as a constraint, an imino proton resonance at 12.31 ppm was assigned to G9 in the 75 nt construct, consistent with formation of an imino G9-A30 pair.\n\nAccuracy of Structure Prediction. The NAPSS-CS algorithm was tested on a total of 18 structures, nine of which contain pseudoknots (Figures 9 and 11 and Figure S10 ). NMR constraints for these sequences are provided in Table 3 and Tables S16\u2212S32. The average sensitivity and PPV were calculated over all 18 structures. A one-tailed, paired t test was performed to test the significance of the improvement in sensitivities and PPVs from constrained NAPSS-CS as compared to those from three other algorithms without restraints ( Table 4 ). The null hypothesis (H 0 ), stating that NAPSS-CS is not more accurate than an alternative program, was tested. Constrained NAPSS-CS was found to have a sensitivity (p < 0.05) significantly higher than those of Fold, 20 ProbKnot, 72 and ShapeKnots, 38 and a PPV significantly higher than that of ProbKnot (Table 4) .\n\nFor structures with pseudoknots, the sensitivity and PPV for pseudoknotted base pairs were calculated separately with eqs 2 and 3. Pseudoknotted base pairs are those that form between single-stranded and loop bases and close the loop involved in formation of those base pairs (see Methods). Pseudoknotted base pairs were predicted considerably better with the constrained NAPSS-CS algorithm than with unrestrained programs ( Table 5 ). The average pseudoknot sensitivity and PPV for NAPSS-CS are 95 and 88%, respectively, compared to \u226433% for each of the other programs when unrestrained. Six of the nine sequences were predicted to be pseudoknotted only by constrained NAPSS-CS.\n\nBoth SHAPE 73 and NMR 39 data are only available for the 74 nt B. mori R2 retrotransposon pseudoknot. When two strong and two moderate SHAPE hits 73 were used as restraints with reactivities of 0.8 and 0.4, respectively, ShapeKnots predicted a structure with 58% sensitivity and PPV for all base pairs, but with no pseudoknotted base pairs. In contrast, NAPSS-CS with only NMR constraints predicted a structure with a sensitivity and PPV of 83 and 91% of all base pairs (Table 4 ) and 79 and 85% of pseudoknotted base pairs (Table 5) , respectively.\n\nAside from the 18 structures whose prediction accuracies are reported, NAPSS-CS failed to give results for two additional structures ( Figure S11 ). The Kluyveromyces lactis telomerase RNA pseudoknot 74 contains a helical walk across a single base pair (C22-G36), which is not allowed by the dynamic programming algorithm. The MLV recording signal pseudoknot 75 has a helical walk across coaxially stacked pseudoknots, which is not supported by NAPSS-CS. 39 Aside from the two structures, little evidence of walks across these arrangements of base pairs exists in the literature. 39 For that reason, NAPSS-CS is designed not to support these structures.\n\nHigh-throughput sequencing methods reveal many new RNAs with unknown structure. 76\u221280 Determination of secondary structure usually involves sequence comparison 7,11\u221213 and/or a 39 The results presented here show that adding chemical shifts for imino, UH5, and AH2 protons can further reduce folding space by indicating the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction of base pairs in helices.\n\nPseudoknots are an important motif because they usually indicate functional significance. Pseudoknots, however, are particularly difficult to prove, partially because of the limited knowledge of the sequence dependence of thermodynamics. 34, 35 The results in Figure 12 and Table 5 show that constraints from NMR dramatically improve evidence for and predictions of pseudoknots. Similar improvement has been shown for 13 sequences when ShapeKnots is restrained with SHAPE data. 38 An NMR and biochemical study of an adenine riboswitch revealed that temperature-independent function required two slowly exchanging secondary structures when ligand was not bound. 6 In vivo chemical mapping of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings suggests that stress-expressed RNAs may have multiple structures. 80 Even an RNA duplex of 22 nucleotides has been shown by NMR to have two slowly exchanging secondary structures. 83, 84 When secondary structures are slowly exchanging so that imino cross-peaks are observed for the different conformations, the NAPSS-CS algorithm may facilitate determination of individual secondary structures.\n\nCompared to proteins, relatively few 3D structures are known for RNA despite the importance of 3D structure for deducing structure\u2212function relationships. In addition to providing base pairing information, NAPSS-CS provides assignments for many imino proton, UH5, and AH2 resonances for bases in canonical base pairs. Assignment of UH5 also allows rapid assignment of UH6. 60 These assignments then permit assignment of other nonexchangeable resonances and thus for many assignments required to determine 3D structure.\n\nThe approach presented here should become more important as the RNA database of NMR spectra, structures, and dynamics grows. For example, additional patterns for chemical shifts and NOE connections may be found and incorporated into the NAPSS-CS algorithm to improve accuracy. Conversely, local environments may produce exceptions to the constraints currently used. A recent apparent exception is the U5 primer binding site in Moloney MLV, 85 where a 5\u2032RGY3\u2032 triplet is flanked by a GU pair on both sides. As more data become available, NMR restraints rather than constraints could be used with chemical mapping data to further improve the overall prediction accuracy. 38 The existing database for pseudoknots, however, is too small to train well the parameters required for an approach using restraints.\n\nBecause RNAs are often difficult to crystallize and packing interactions can affect structure, 86 it is likely that NMR will continue to be an important method for determining RNA structure. The approach can also be applied to other Figure 12 . Average accuracy of prediction of RNA secondary structure with NAPSS-CS constrained by NMR data compared with Fold, 20 ProbKnot, 72 and ShapeKnots 38 when the last three are not restrained by experimental data. Accuracy was measured as sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV). On the left are shown the average sensitivity and PPV for canonical base pairs of structures in a database of nine nonpseudoknotted and nine pseudoknotted structures (Table 4 ). On the right are shown the average sensitivity and PPV for predicting the presence of a pseudoknot (Table 5) . Pseudoknot sensitivity and PPV were not calculated for structures predicted with Fold because it does not allow pseudoknots. 38 If predicted structures have pseudoknots, then the sensitivity and PPV are calculated with eqs 2 and 3 only for base pairs involved in the pseudoknots. If the predicted structure contains no pseudoknot, then the sensitivity and PPV are defined as 0%. For structures predicted with Fold, the pseudoknot sensitivity and PPV are 0% because it does not allow prediction of pseudoknots.\n\nself-assembling polymers that would generate NOESY walks and have known thermodynamics.
