{"title": "Glycyrrhizin Inhibits Interleukin-8 Production and Nuclear Factor-\u03baB Activity in Lung Epithelial Cells, but Not Through Glucocorticoid Receptors", "body": "Glucocorticoids are the most effective therapy for the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways (1 -3). Functionally, they act partly by inducing some antiinflammatory genes, such as lipocortin-1 (4), secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (5) , and interleukin (IL)-1-receptor antagonist (6) , but mainly by repression of inflammatory genes, such as IL-8 and eotaxin (7, 8) . They act by binding to a cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and rapidly induce the translocation of GR to the nucleus (9) . Within the nucleus, GR either induces gene transcription by binding to specific DNA elements in the promoter /enhancer regions of responsive genes or reduces gene transcription by functional interaction with pro-inflammatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB (p65/p50 heterodimers) (2, 9 -11) . Despite their effectiveness, the use of glucocorticoids in lung diseases is limited because of their severe side effects.\n\nGlycyrrhizin (GL), a triterpene glycoside from licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra), is composed of a molecule of glycyrrhetic acid (GA) and two molecules of glucronic acid. In Japan, GL has been used clinically for more than 20 years in patients with chronic hepatitis (12, 13) . So far, GL has been reported to have a variety of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, and anti-viral activities. For instance (14 -17) , it has been reported that orally administrated GL inhibits asthmatic responses in obalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice and reduces levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (15) , which suggests the usefulness of GL, as well as glucocorticoids, for lung inflammation. GL has been shown to be transformed to the metabolite GA by glucuronidase in intestinal bacteria (18) . The mechanism of action of GL in vivo has been believed for some time to be due to this GA, which can inhibit 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11\u03b2-HSD) (19) .\n\nHowever, intravenously administrated GL has also been shown to inhibit the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced severe acute respiratory syndrome in mice (16) , which suggests that biological transfer to GA by intestinal bacteria is not necessary for its glucocorticoid-like effects. In addition to this, GL and its related compounds have been shown to inhibit IL-8 and eotaxin production induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines in cultured fibroblast cells (20) , although the mechanism has not been elucidated. Taking these findings together, we presumed that GL itself may have glucocorticoid-like action.\n\nTherefore in the present study, we evaluated the glucocorticoid-like effect of GL by examining the effects of GL on TNF-\u03b1-and IL-1\u03b2-induced IL-8 production, mRNA expression, and its promoter activity and compared them with the effects of dexamethasone (DEX). We also examined the effects of GL and DEX on NF-\u03baB transcription factor activation.\n\nGL was supplied by Minophagen Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo) as a powder of >99% purified glycyrrhizin-NH 4 . DEX, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and RU-486 were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).\n\nA549 human lung carcinoma cells (Riken Bioresourse Center, Tsukuba) were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Nisssui, Tokyo) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA), 100 U / ml penicillin, and 100 \u00b5g/ ml streptomycin at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 and 95% air. For assays, the cells were cultured with DMEM containing charcoal-stripped 5% FBS and antibiotics.\n\nCulture-conditioned media were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. IL-8 in culture-conditioned media was assayed by commercially available ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.\n\nRNA isolation and quantitative real-time RT-PCR for IL-8 mRNA\n\nTotal RNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Random-primed cDNA was prepared from 0.5 \u00b5g total RNA using the Prime Script Reverse Transcriptase (Takara Bio, Otsu). PCR amplification was carried out with SYBR \u00ae Premix Ex Taq TM (Takara Bio) and analyzed in 96-well optical reaction plates, using the threshold cycle (Ct) method (21) . An IL-8 cDNA fragment was amplified with the 5'-catgact tccaagctggccg-3' and 5'-tttatgaattctcagccctc-3' primer pair. A GAPDH cDNA fragment was amplified with the 5'-accatcttccaggagcgaga-3' and 5'-cagtcttctgggtggca gtg-3' primer pair. The PCR conditions were set at 95\u00b0C for 3 min to activate the TaqDNA polymerase, followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. The fluorescence was monitored at the end of each cycle to obtain a measure of the amount of PCR product formed. The thermocycler PCR data were analyzed with the software installed in the iCycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), which determines the cycle number at which each sample reaches this threshold. The cycle number corresponding to the fluorescence threshold is inversely related to logarithm of the initial template concentration. Given that amplification occurs in an exponential manner, a difference of 1 in the cycle threshold corresponds approximately to a twofold difference in relative transcript abundance. The amount of IL-8 mRNA was normalized by that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA and is presented in arbitrary units, with 1 unit corresponding to the value in control cells treated with vehicle.\n\nThe IL-8-luc and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-luc reporter gene contains the \u2212422 / +54-bp region of the IL-8 gene and the \u2212224/ +100-bp region of the MMTV gene driving firefly luciferase expression vector pGL2 basic, respectively (22) . The NF-\u03baB-luc construct was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA, USA). Transient transfection with the DNA plasmid was performed using the HilyMax reagent (Dojindo, Kumamoto) in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, cells cultured in 24-well plates were transfected with the DNA-transfection reagent mixture at 70% -80% confluency. At 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with drugs and harvested for detection of luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer (Lumat LB9507; EG&G Berthold, Oak Ridge, TN, USA) using Dual Luciferase Assay kits (Promega, San Luis Obispo, CA, USA). Co-transfection with phRL-TK (Promega), which expresses Renilla luciferase, was performed to enable normalization of data for transfection efficiency. Transfection with GR siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA) was performed with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.\n\nCells cultured on glass-bottomed dishes were treated with drug, after which cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton-X. Cells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 20 min and incubated with mouse anti-p65 NF-\u03baB antibody for 1 h (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). After the primary antibody reaction, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanateconjugated anti-mouse IgG for 30 min. Cells were visualized and analyzed with a Fluoview FV300 confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo). A semi-quantitative analysis of cytoplasmic p65 was performed in a blinded fashion by scoring 100 -120 cells on one coverslide.\n\nCells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, scraped, and collected by centrifugation. Collected cells were resuspended in SDS lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, and 1% (v / v) protease inhibitor cocktail] and incubated on ice for 20 min. The lysates were then sonicated on a Bioruptor UCD-250 (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo) with a power output setting of 250 W. The samples were centrifuged and the supernatants were diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer [50 mM Tris / HCl (pH 8.0), 167 mM NaCl, 1.1% Triton X-100, 0.11% deoxycholate, 1% (v / v) protease inhibitor cocktail], and pre-cleared with salmon sperm DNA/ protein G agarose slurry for 4 h at 4\u00b0C. Crosslinked chromatin was incubated with 4 \u00b5g anti-p65 antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. Immuno-complexes were collected by immunoprecipitation with salmon sperm DNA/ protein G agarose slurry for 3 h at 4\u00b0C. The beads were washed sequentially in the following buffers: low salt wash buffer [50 mM Tris / HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate]; high salt wash buffer [50 mM Tris / HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate]; LiCl wash buffer [10 mM Tris / HCl (pH 8.0), 0.25 M LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% deoxycholate]; and Tris / EDTA buffer. Immuno-complexes were extracted from the beads with ChIP elution buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS]. Cross-linking was reversed by incubation at 65\u00b0C for 6 -12 h. The eluants were digested with proteinase K at 55\u00b0C for 1 h, and then they were further subjected to phenol / chloroform extraction. The DNA was purified by ethanol precipitation. Real-time PCR was performed to determine the percentage of p65 in the genomic region of IL-8 precipitated with antibodies against input DNA. The oligonucleotide primers used to amplify the genomic region of IL-8 (\u2212121 / +61) were as follows: 5'-gggccatcagttgcaaatc-3' (sense) and 5'-ttccttccggtggtttc ttc-3' (antisense).\n\nDifferences in means \u00b1 S.E.M. values among groups were assessed by Dunnett's test. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and P<0.05 was considered significant.\n\nTo examine the effect of GL on IL-8 production, IL-8 protein levels in spent culture media of A549 cells treated with either TNF-\u03b1 (2.5 ng / ml) or IL-1\u03b2 (1 ng / ml) were measured by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 1 , IL-8 levels in these cytokine-treated media were significantly greater compared with those in control media, and pretreatment of DEX (100 nM) markedly blocked these increases in IL-8 release. As well as the effect of DEX, pretreatment of GL (0.1, 0.3, and 1 mM) concentration-dependently blocked both TNF-\u03b1-and IL-1\u03b2-induced IL-8-release, with the most pronounced inhibition being noted for 1 mM GL (35% and 32% of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 alone, respectively) (Fig. 1 ). IL-8 mRNA level was determined by real-time PCR. TNF-\u03b1, as well as IL-1\u03b2, caused a 10-and 16-fold increase in IL-8 mRNA level compared with that in the controls (Fig. 2) . Pretreatment of DEX blocked these increases in IL-8 mRNA, although the inhibition was not complete. GL (0.1, 0.3, and 1 mM) also concentration-dependently blocked both TNF-\u03b1-and IL-1\u03b2-induced increases in IL-8 mRNA. GL (1 mM) significantly inhibited by 30% and 50% compared with TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 alone, respectively (Fig. 2) . These data suggested that GL inhibited IL-8 production through inhibition of IL-8 mRNA expression.\n\nTo examine whether GL inhibited IL-8 transcription, A549 cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmid containing human IL-8 promoter, and the effect of GL was examined by luciferase assay. In good agreement with the changes in the levels of IL-8 protein and mRNA, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 activated the IL-8 promoter gene. The TNF-\u03b1 responses and the IL-1\u03b2 ones induced five-and seven-fold increases in luciferase activity, respectively (Fig. 3 ). In addition, DEX significantly blocked the activation of the IL-8 promoter gene by these stimulants. GL also blocked these promoter activations in a concentration-dependent manner. GL (1 mM) significantly decreased that by 50% compared with TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 alone (Fig. 3) . It has been shown that both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 activate IL-8 promoter gene through the activation of NF-\u03baB transcription factor (23, 24) . Therefore, luciferase assay was performed with artificial promoter plasmid containing three NF-\u03baB sites, instead of the IL-8 promoter gene. Both GL and DEX significantly inhibited the activation of the NF-\u03baB promoter gene induced by TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 4) , which suggests that GL, as well as DEX, inhibits NF-\u03baB-dependent gene transcription.\n\nTNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 activate I\u03baB kinases (IKKs) and subsequently I\u03baB-\u03b1 is degraded (25) . Then, the NF-\u03baB component p65 is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and activates transcription of target genes (25) . To examine whether GL inhibits nuclear translocation of p65, the p65 in A549 cells was visualized by immunofluoresence. In control cells, most p65 signals were associated with the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A) . In contrast, after 1-h treatment with TNF-\u03b1, the p65 signals in the cytoplasm were markedly decreased and increased nuclear signals were observed (Fig. 5A ). The number of cells that had nuclear p65 signals was counted, and the ratio to the total number of cells is shown in Fig. 5B . In the TNF-\u03b1-treated cells, translocalization to the nuclei was observed in 78% of cells. GL and DEX did not inhibit p65 translocation, whereas MG132, an inhibitor of I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, considerably decreased the number of cells that had nuclear p65. These data suggested that both GL and DEX inhibited NF-\u03baB-dependent gene expression after translocation to the nucleus.\n\nAs a result of the structural similarity between GL and DEX, it may be thought that the DEX-like inhibitory effects of GL are mediated through GRs. To assess this possibility, the influence of GR antagonists and GR knock down on the effects of GL and DEX were examined in an IL-8 promoter reporter assay. RU486 (100 nM), a GR antagonist, completely abolished the inhibitory effect of DEX on TNF-\u03b1-induced IL-8 promoter activation (Fig. 6A) . In contrast, RU486 did not antagonize the effect of GL (Fig. 6A ). In addition, GL inhibited TNF-\u03b1-induced IL-8 promoter gene activation in both control and GR siRNA-transfected knock down cells, whereas the inhibition by DEX was completely abolished (Fig. 6B) . Furthermore, GL did not activate MMTV-promoter, a glucocorticoiddependent gene, in the luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 6C) . These data clearly suggested that GL inhibited NF-\u03baB-dependent gene transcription, but not through GR activation.\n\nFinally, the effects of GL and DEX on DNA binding to p65 were examined. In the ChIP assay, DNA binding to p65 in TNF-\u03b1-treated cells was significantly increased compared with that in control cells (Fig. 7) . GL, but not DEX, inhibited DNA binding to p65 (Fig. 7) , which suggests that GL-induced inhibition of IL-8 transcription may be due to p65 binding.\n\nAirway epithelial cells are not only a passive barrier, but also play a crucial role in the inflammatory response by producing various mediators (26) . IL-8 is one of the most important mediators from airway epithelial cells, which activates neutrophil influx into lung tissue (26) . The inhibition of IL-8 production by glucocorticoids, based on the inhibition of NF-\u03baB, is related to their antiinflammatory effects. In the present study, we examined the effect of GL on IL-8 production, mRNA expression, and promoter activation induced by TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, to evaluate its glucocorticoid-like effect. The data clearly indicated that GL, as well as DEX, inhibits IL-8 production. GL inhibited both TNF-\u03b1-and IL-1\u03b2induced IL-8 production (Fig. 1) . Therefore, we can exclude the possibility that GL inhibits the effects of these pro-inflammatory cytokines at their receptors.\n\nBoth GL and DEX decreased the level of IL-8 mRNA and IL-8 promoter activity (Figs. 2 and 3) , in good agreement with the decrease in the amount of IL-8 protein. In addition, both GL and DEX inhibited the activation of artificial-promoter-containing NF-\u03baB sites (Fig. 4) . We assumed therefore, that GL, as well as DEX, inhibited IL-8 gene expression through the inhibition of NF-\u03baB transcription factor. We also assume that GL may inhibit expression of not only IL-8, but also other NF-\u03baB-dependent inflammatory genes such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxigansae-2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2. To support this idea, GL also inhibited mRNA expression of iNOS in our preliminary study (data not shown), although we did not examine other genes.\n\nThe inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on NF-\u03baB is thought to be due to an intranuclear event (27, 28) . Glucocorticoids act by binding to cytosolic GRs, which upon binding, become activated and translocate to the nucleus (9) . It is known that GR rapidly reduces p65associated histone acetyltransferase activity by the recruitment of histone deacetylase-2 to the nucleus, which results in inhibition of NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription (29 -31) . In the present study, DEX did not inhibit the translocation of p65 to the nucleus, which suggests that inhibition of IL-8 promoter activation by DEX is due to these intranuclear events. Similarly, GL did not affect p65 translocation to the nucleus (Fig. 5) . Therefore, we assume that GL, as well as DEX, inhibits NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription in the nucleus.\n\nDespite these similarities between the effects of GL and those of DEX, the data in the present study exclude the possibility that GL acts at GRs. Both the combined treatment of RU-486 with GL and GR knockdown by siRNA failed to abolish the effect of GL (Fig. 6: A and  B ). In addition, GL did not activate glucocorticoiddependent gene transcription by itself, as assessed by the MMTV-promoter reporter gene assay (Fig. 6C) . Earlier studies have shown that a degradation product of GL, GA, enhances the effect of glucocorticoids by inhibiting 11\u03b2-HSD (19) . Therefore, we also examined the effect of GA in an IL-8 reporter gene assay. GA (10 \u00b5M) did not inhibit IL-8 promoter activation by TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 at all, and it was toxic to the cells at higher concentrations. Therefore, we can also exclude the possibility that the effect of GL shown here was due to contaminated GA.\n\nRecently, it has been reported that GL directly binds to high-motility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) and inhibits its chemoattractant activity (32) . HMGB1 is a nuclear protein that acts as an architectural chromatinbinding factor (33, 34) . It has been shown that HMGB1 Fig. 7 . Effects of GL and DEX on DNA-binding of p65. A549 cells were pretreated with either GL (1 mM) or DEX (100 nM) for 1 h and treated with TNF-\u03b1 (2.5 ng/ml) for 2 h. The soluble chromatin extracts from the cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-p65 or control IgG and then subjected to real-time PCR with primer pairs for the IL-8 promoter gene. The amount of DNA binding was normalized by \"Input\" that was the crude chromatin extracts prior to immunoprecipitation. Results represent the means \u00b1 S.E.M. from three independent experiments. *P<0.05 and # P<0.05 vs control and TNF-\u03b1 alone, respectively. directly interacts with the p50 subunit of NF-\u03baB and facilitates the binding to DNA of the p65 / p50 complex (35) . In their report, TNF-\u03b1-stimulated VCAM-1 expression in embryonic fibroblasts derived from HMGB1-deficient mice was considerably decreased, compared with that in control cells. In addition to these intranuclear functions, HMGB1 acts as an important extracellular inflammatory mediator, which is released from necrotic cells and stimulated monocytes (36) . Extracellular HMGB1 interacts with plasma membrane receptors, such as receptor for advanced glycogen endproducts, and activates signaling pathways, including MyD88, TRAF6, TAK1, and NF-\u03baB activation (37) . Considering the importance of HMGB1 in the inflammatory response, the inhibition of NF-\u03baB-dependent gene expression by GL shown here might have been due to inhibition of HMGB1. In the present study, GL decreased DNA binding to p65 in the ChIP assay, without changing the nuclear translocation of p65. Furthermore, Mollica et al. (32) have shown that the addition of GL to extracellular medium can inhibit intranuclear DNA binding of HMGB1 in fibroblasts. Therefore, we assume that the inhibition of intranuclear HMGB1 may be a possible mechanism for NF-\u03baB inhibition by GL. However, further studies are clearly needed to prove this hypothesis.\n\nIn summary, the present study clearly indicates that GL has a glucocorticoid-like inhibitory effect on proinflammatory-cytokine-induced gene expression in lung epithelial cells. It is likely that this effect is, at least partly, due to the inhibition of DNA binding of NF-\u03baB in the nucleus, which is different from the mechanism of glucocorticoids. The concentration of GL we used in this study is much higher than the blood concentration in clinical therapeutics. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the inhibition of NF-\u03baB that we showed here can explain the clinical effect of GL or not. However, further characterization of the effects of GL may provide a new insight into treating chronic inflammatory lung diseases."}
