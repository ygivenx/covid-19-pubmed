{"title": "Title: 2 The Role of Interleukin-1 cytokine family (IL-1\u03b2, IL-37) and interleukin-12 cytokine 3 family (IL-12, IL-35) in eumycetoma infection pathogenesis. Authors 7 Corresponding Author", "body": "Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous subcutaneous inflammatory disease, caused by 108 certain bacteria (actinomycetoma) or fungi (eumycetoma). This infection progresses to affect pre-existing Th2 environment caused by schistosomiasis promotes the development of 140 mycetoma as patients with mycetoma were significantly more positive for schistosoma 141 antibodies than healthy endemic controls [9] . These findings suggested that Th2 like 142 response and anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive cytokines could have a negative impact 143 on mycetoma development and disease progression. 144 IL-1 is a polypeptide which has two forms; IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. It is involved in the acute-phase 145 response and is accountable for several alterations that are related to the onset of various 146 medical disorders [15, 16] . It is demonstrated recently that higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 cytokine 147 are strongly associated with surgically treated mycetoma patients, in comparison to those 148 treated without surgery [17] . It is known that IL-1\u03b2 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is 149 involved in cell death coordination [18] . IL-1\u03b2 cytokine is cleaved into the mature, active and disease severity in murine aspergillosis [29] . In addition to its role in innate immunity; IL-174 37 plays a pivotal role in regulating adaptive immunity by inducing regulatory T (T reg ) cells 175 and impairing activation of effector T-cell responses [30] . To our knowledge, there has been 176 no study to report the relationship between IL-37 and mycetoma pathogenesis so far. poorly understood. However IL-35 is recognised as a typical anti-inflammatory cytokine, and 189 the predominant mechanism of suppression is associated with its ability to suppress T cell (Table 2) . On the other hand, the 287 levels of cytokine IL-1\u03b2 were constitutively negatively correlated with IL-37 and IL-35, ( Table   288 2). Furthermore, the levels of cytokine IL-37 were constitutively positively correlated with IL-289 35 (Table 2) . However, the levels of cytokine IL-37 and IL-35 were constitutively negatively 290 correlated with IL-12 (Table 2) . (Table 3) . Whereas, levels of IL-37 were constitutively positively correlated with IL-35 (Table   .

Furthermore, the circulating levels of IL-37 had significantly decreased with 369 increasing age groups [(19-24 years; p-value = 0.0100), 25-29 years; p-value =0.030 and 370 (30-39) years; p-value = 0.022)] (Table 8) . Interestingly, levels of IL-37 among mycetoma 371 patients showed a statistically significant difference between Itraconazole compared to 372 Ketoconazole, p < 0.001, (Table 8) . (Table 9 ). Additionally, the circulating levels of IL-35 showed no 384 significant association with the different age groups (Table 9) . Interestingly, treatment with 385 Itraconazole significantly increased circulating levels of IL-35 among mycetoma patients 386 compared to treatment with Ketoconazole, p-value <0.001, (Table 9) .

More investigations are needed 506 to explore the mechanism by which IL-35 and IL-37 contribute in the mycetoma infection 507 outcomes. This will help in understanding the role of these cytokines IL-35 and IL-37 in the 508 pathogenesis of mycetoma, and may exploit it as a potential therapeutic target to prevent 509 mycetoma diseases recurrence. .
