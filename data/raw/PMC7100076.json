{"title": "Management of SARS relies on supportive measures and preventing the spread of infection", "body": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a recently emerged severe respiratory infection, is caused by a previously unrecognised virus, now called the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV).[1] The condition was first recognised in late 2002 in the Guangdong Province in Southeast China. From there it spread rapidly to the rest of the world during the early months of 2003.[1] As of July 2003, the total number of people infected with SARS worldwide was 8437 with a mortality rate of 9.6%.[2] The vast majority of cases have been from Asia.[2] The SARS-CoV is evident in a number of animals and appears to have undergone interspecies transmission to infect humans.[1]\n\nSARS primarily infects adults aged 25\u201370 years, but the mortality rate is higher in older individuals (aged >60 years) and in those with comorbidities.[1]\n\nTransmission of SARS appears to occur most commonly via close face-to-face contact with infected individuals, and the greatest risk is probably from droplet transmission of respiratory secretions.[3] In some settings, airborne or faecal transmission may also play a role in the spread of the disease. Although most cases have been in healthcare workers and family members of patients with SARS, there is evidence that community spread also occurs.[3]\n\nPatients do not appear to be infective before they develop symptoms, and preliminary data suggests that they are at their most contagious during the second week of the illness.[4]\n\nAfter about 3\u20137 days, lower respiratory symptoms commence, including a non-productive cough and progressive pneumonia.[1] In about 20\u201330% of patients, SARS will progress to an acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring ventilator support.[1] Some patients may experience less severe symptoms, whereas others experience hyperacute progression.[1] Epidemiological data suggest that asymptomatic infection is very uncommon.[3]\n\nIn a report of a complete SARS outbreak in Vietnam, which evaluated 62 hospitalised patients, only a minority had symptoms of respiratory tract infection on admission; most developed these symptoms during their stay in hospital.[5] Figure 1 summarises the symptoms that were evident at admission or reported later in the course of the illness.[5] The mean times from the onset of illness until the evolution of various endpoints of the disease were:[5]\n\n\nonset of fever 0.3 daysadmission to hospital 4.3 daysonset of radiographic change 4.4 daysonset of respiratory symptoms 4.5 daysmaximal radiographic change 10 daysintubation 10.5 daysend of fever 12.7 daysdeath 18.8 days.\n\n\nSARS is often associated with absolute lymphopenia, mild neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.[1] In about 30\u201380% of patients, mild to moderately elevated plasma levels of creatine phosphokinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and transaminases were also evident.[1]\n\nChest x-ray abnormalities usually develop after the initial phase of the illness and often progress to bilateral lung disease from about day 3. Therefore, repeated chest x-rays during the initial phase of the disease, sometimes twice daily, may be helpful in establishing disease progression.[1] Blood and sputum cultures, and testing for viral respiratory pathogens should also be performed to identify specific organisms associated with pneumonia.[1]\n\nSeveral methods are now available for identifying the SARS-CoV, including culture methods, polymerase chain reaction-based methods and serological tests.[6] Analysing multiple specimens (e.g. stool, serum, sputum) may increase the likelihood of confirming a diagnosis of SARS.[1]\n\nSome clinicians recommend ribavirin and corticosteroids, but neither therapy is recommended alone.[1] The benefits of ribavirin therapy may not be sufficient to outweigh the risk of adverse events.[7] In a study of 110 patients with suspected or probable SARS, ribavirin was associated with haemolytic anaemia, hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia in 61%, 58% and 46% of patients, respectively.[7] The use of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of SARS is also controversial, as they can be hazardous in patients with viral infections unless accompanied by an effective antiviral agent.[8]\n\nInterferon-\u03b1, glycyrrhizin and protease inhibitors have also been suggested for the treatment of SARS.[3] In uncontrolled data in a 21 patients, interferon 9 \u00b5g/day for 2 days, increased to 15 \u00b5g/day for 10 days, plus corticosteroids was associated with reduced impaired oxygen saturation and hastened the resolution of radiographic lung abnormalities.[9]\n\nInternational cooperation is needed to ensure that healthcare policies are in place in each region, and that systems are prepared to respond rapidly to any emerging infectious threat.[1] New cases need to be detected as early as possible, all patient contacts identified, and updated recommendations for infection control procedures should be consulted.[10]\n\nThe US Center for Disease Control and Prevention has released clinical guidelines for the identification and evaluation of possible SARS-CoV disease among patients presenting with community-acquired illness in the absence or presence of SARS-CoV transmission anywhere in the world (Patient care guidelines).[10]\n\nStrict adherence to infection control policies is important. In patients hospitalised with suspected/probable SARS, infection control measures include:[1,11]\nplacing patients in negative-pressure, vented roomsmaintaining logs of everyone entering patients\u2019 roomsrestricting visitorslimiting the number of hospital personnel caring for patientsusing standard hand-hygiene (thorough washing with soap and water or use of an alcohol-based hand rub), contact (gowns, gloves, goggles) and airborne (high-efficiency masks) precautions in all healthcare workers entering the roomsminimising air turbulence when changing linenregular cleaning and disinfecting of environmental surfaces that come into contact with patients or their body fluidslimiting cough-inducing procedures (sputum induction, administration of nebulised medications, suctioning, bronchoscopy)avoiding the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilationusing closed-suctioning devices and high-efficiency particulate air filtration on exhalation valve port in patients receiving mechanical ventilationeducating personnel involved in the care of these patients to be vigilant for symptoms of SARS for 10 days after patient contactquarantining personnel who have had unprotected contact with SARS patients during aerosol-generating procedures.\n\n\nThe importance of infection control measures was demonstrated in a study of healthcare workers in five Hong Kong hospitals who had documented evidence of contact with SARS patients.[12] All workers who wore gowns, gloves and surgical or high efficiency masks, and performed good hand-washing techniques did not develop SARS, whereas all 13 workers who became infected omitted at least one of the above measures (p = 0.02). High-efficiency masks, such as the N-95 or surgical masks, were more effective in reducing transmission than paper masks.[12]\n\nPatients with SARS who do not require hospitalisation can be managed at home.[1] They should limit their interactions outside of the home, wear surgical masks when in contact with others, and wash their hands frequently.[1] After resolution of fever, the patient should stay away from work for 10 days. Other household members or close contacts should wear gloves and also practice careful hand hygiene. In the absence of fever or respiratory symptoms, they need not limit their activities.[1]\n\nThe future impact of SARS is difficult to predict.[1] Although sporadic cases in China are cause for concern, the extent to which the disease will re-emerge in the future is unknown.[1] It is possible that SARS may become an important cause of pneumonia in the future and the screening of outpatients at risk for SARS may become part of pneumonia evaluations.[1]"}
