{"title": "Topoisomerase III-\u00df is required for efficient replication of positive-sense RNA viruses", "body": "Acute viral infections, particularly those caused by RNA viruses, are dangerous threats to public health. This has been made evident by the ongoing pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), officially named COVID-19, caused by the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2.\n\nWhen confronted with emerging viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 we are left with few countermeasures that can be deployed to specifically prevent or treat the diseases they cause. We and others have argued that deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms required for viral replication can reveal potential vulnerabilities for related viruses. These vulnerabilities could be based on unique viral targets, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, or on dependency on host encoded pro-viral activities. To identify such host pro-viral factors we embarked on genome-scale screens for diverse families of viruses and identified scores of required host factors [1] [2] [3] [4] . Some of these host factors are attractive drug targets.\n\nA meta-analysis of RNAi-based loss-of-function screens for YFV and DENV-2 host factors revealed 274 common candidates 1 . TDRD3, a Tudor domain containing protein that interacts with methylated arginine motifs 5 , was identified as a candidate host factor required for both DENV2/YFV. In the two YFV screens TDRD3 ranked 66 th of over 21,500 gene products in terms of how well its knockdown decreased YFV (adjusted p value = 0.0006). CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout of TDRD3 in HuH-7 cells confirmed that this protein was required for efficient DENV-2 replication (Fig 1A & B) .\n\nA well-known function of TDRD3 is to bind and stabilize Topoisomerase III-\u00df (TOP3B) 6-8 , a type IA topoisomerase and the only human topoisomerase known to act on both DNA and RNA 6, 9 . Knockout of TDRD3 in HuH-7 cells led to levels of TOP3B that were almost as low as those obtained with knockout of TOP3B itself (Fig 1C) . Knockout of TOP3B, which does not alter TDRD3 levels, resulted in the same dramatic decrease in DENV-2, YFV and Zika virus (ZIKV) replication as knockout of TDRD3 (Fig 1D & E) , which suggested that the only role of TDRD3 .

Indeed, TOP3B overexpression rescued DENV-2 infection in TDRD3 KO cells (Fig 1F) . The reverse was not true, TDRD3 overexpression was incapable of rescuing virus replication in a TOP3B KO cells. Therefore, we conclude that TOP3B is a proviral host factor for several flaviviruses.\n\nThe genetic approaches we utilized above do not distinguish between direct and indirect modes of action. To address whether or not TOP3B directly interacted with DENV-2 genomes we used UV crosslinking followed by RNA immunoprecipitation (CLIP). We carried out CLIP assays using a HEK-293T cell line that expressed a FLAG-tagged TOP3B upon doxycycline treatment and anti-FLAG antibodies to carry out the immunoprecipitation. FLAG-TOP3B preferentially crosslinked to CELSR2 RNA, which was previously known to bind this topoisomerase 6 , relative to EEF1A1 RNA, which we use as a negative control ( Fig 1H) .\n\nImportantly, TOP3B crosslinked DENV-2 RNA (Fig 1H) , strongly suggesting that TOP3B acts directly on the viral genome.\n\nSince TOP3B was required for DENV-2, YFV and ZIKV replication, we asked whether or not this topoisomerase was required for replication of other viruses. Influenza A virus, which has a negative-sense segmented RNA genome and belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae, replicated significantly better in TOP3B KO cells than in the parental HuH-7 cells (Fig 2A, left panel), suggesting that TOP3B plays an anti-viral role for influenza A virus. We also tested Ebola virus, a member of the family Filoviridae, which has a negative sense RNA genome and again noted that Ebola virus replicated slightly better in TOP3B KO cells than in the parental HuH-7 cells (Fig 2A, right panel) . We thus suggest that TOP3B may be an anti-viral factor for negative sense RNA viruses, and clearly is not required for the replication of influenza A virus or Ebola virus.\n\n.

A recombinant chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus of the Togaviridae family was sensitive to TDRD3 knockout ( Fig 2B, left panel) , and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), an enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae, was dependent on TOP3B for efficient replication (Fig 2B, right panel) .\n\nMost important in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, four betacoronaviruses, of the Coronaviridae family, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SCH1014-CoV, a bat coronavirus, were significantly crippled by TOP3B KO (Fig 2C) . These results indicated that TOP3B is a host factor essential for efficient replication of a diverse group of (+) ss RNA viruses.\n\nAmong host factors required for diverse groups of RNA viruses are components of the translation machinery and the proteasome, in addition to factors that mediate membrane transactions required for entry and exit of viruses. The understanding of the broad requirement for TOP3B among (+) ss RNA viruses will likely provide important insights into heretofore understudied steps in their lifecycles. While a requirement for human topoisomerase TOP1 in exacerbated inflammation induced by RNA virus infection has been previously documented 10 , the direct action of an RNA topoisomerase in viral replication is unprecedented, and has important biological implications. A requirement for a RNA topoisomerase as a critical cofactor for (+) ss RNA viruses is reasonable since viral genomes, because of their complex structures and size, especially the large coronaviruses, may lend themselves to topological problems (knots and catenanes) 11,12 . In parallel work focused on exploring these implications we have shown that TOP3B is required for a late step in DENV-2 replication, likely during the assembly of the genome into virions (Prasanth et al., manuscript in preparation). Furthermore, this action requires the topoisomerase activity of TOP3B since it is abrogated by a tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation (Y336F) in the active site of the enzyme (Ibid).

It must be clear that we make this suggestion responsibly with full understanding that our work is an early step in what must be a rigorous process to identify effective antivirals. Nonetheless, several facts support this consideration. TOP3B -/mice are viable 13 and humans with a homozygous 240-kb deletion of chromosome 22q11.22 spanning TOP3B gene are also viable 7 . Although both homozygous null mice and humans have abnormal phenotypes, the enzyme is not essential. Topoisomerase inhibitors are well known drugs used to treat cancer (e.g. doxorubicin) 14 and bacterial infections (e.g., ciproflaxin) 15 . Unfortunately, we are not aware of any approved TOP3B drugs and prior to this report there was no evidence that inhibiting TOP3B could be a useful in treating acute viral infections. In fact other than the ACE-2 receptor, and perhaps furin, required for SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry 16 , TOP3B is the only other known required host factor. We hope this brief communication will spur interactions between individuals studying TOP3B and developing inhibitors of TOP3B, and those working on SARS-CoV-2.\n\n.
