T h e illustrative information set out in Table I indicates the wide range of p h e n o m e n a involved. It will be the assumption of this discussion that specific molecules at the surface of cells carry out the various functions here tabulated. In some cases, this postulate rests on very few, but intriguing, observations; in others the data have converted hypothesis to established fact.\n\nT h e working model for the cell surface derives from that proposed by Singer and Nicolson (1972) . T h e plasmalemma is considered to comprise a fluid lipid phase into which are inserted structural and functional proteins and glycoproteins, the distribution of which is subject to continual quantiative and qualitative modification during growth and development. A central problem in the present consideration is the mechanism whereby the cell surface is formed from its constituent building blocks. T h e r e is considerable information on the general patterns of synthesis of neutral lipids (Spector, 1972) , phospholipids ( M c M u r r a y and Magee, 1972) , sterols (Rothblat, 1972) , glycolipids (cf. R o s e m a n , 1970), proteins, and glycoproteins (cf. Schachter and Roden, 1973) by animal tissues. But little is known about the reactions by which individual cells generate these components and mold them into a functioning plasmalemma.\n\nOf specific importance will be the synthesis and incorporation into the cell surface of glycolipids and glycoproteins. It will be assumed that de novo synthesis of these molecules by the various fibroblast types discussed proceeds by procedures already established. In the case of the glycolipids, the sugars are added stepwise to a preformed ceramide base through the action of specific glycosyl transferases (cf. R o s e m a n , 1970). T h e protein of glycoproteins is synthesized on polyribosomes and there, upon completion, accepts the first sugar residue. O n c e again carbohydrate residues are added sequentially by specific sugar-transferring enzymes, as the glycoprotein is transported through the Golgi apparatus to its site at the cell periphery (cf. Schachter and Roden, 1973) . O u r own studies on the synthesis of surface glycoprotein by mouse fibroblasts are in accord with the general aspects of the latter model, since treatment of cells with puromycin or cycloheximide brings rapid inhibition of formation of peptide and oligosaccharide moieties .\n\nThis chapter will address itself to the following questions: (i) What are the modifications to the metabolism of surface molecules, which are inflicted upon cells by their infecting viruses? (ii) U n d e r what conditions, can these modified pathways become stablized, thereby producing a permanent alteration of the cell surface? (iii) In what way do the oncogenic viruses resemble, or differ from, their nononcogenic counterparts in their effects on cell surface metabolism?\n\nT h e interactions of viruses with the surface of cells may perhaps be classified u n d e r three headings: (i) reactions by which an infecting virus is permitted entry into the cell; (ii) reactions by which newly replicated virus is permitted exit from the cell; (iii) reactions of biogenesis of the integral plasma m e m b r a n e (Singer and Nicolson, 1972) and its peripheral components which are directly or indirectly modified as a result of virus infection. This chapter will concern itself primarily with class (iii) phenomena, for these appear to offer the most suitable target for oncogenic conversion. T h e many processes embraced under classes (i) and (ii) are discussed elsewhere (Allison, 1971; Poste, 1970; Krizanova et al., 1971; Dales, 1973a,b; M e d z o n , 1973) . Of these, the action of viral neuramini- 13 . VIRUS MODIFICATION AND TRANSFORMATION 375 dases (cf. Drzeniek, 1972) may be relevant, and will be commented upon below.\n\nA s noted in Tables II and I I I , the genome of many viruses carries information that directly, or indirectly, results in modification of the metabolism of molecules at the surface of the host cell. T h e ingenuity of many investigators has been employed in isolating virus strains, a major expression of which is seen in this function, normal or mutant (Ghendon, 1972; Vogt, 1972; Roizman et al, 1973) . Such variants are known to occur in nature (Poste, 1970; ; N a g a t a et ai, Higashi, 1973; Roizman et ai, 1973; Dales, 1973b) . M a n y more undoubtedly remain to be discovered, and perhaps even to be produced.\n\nT h e most profound direct effects on the synthesis and turnover of the plasmalemma is to be observed in vertebrate cells infected by enveloped viruses. T h e s e microorganisms contain a core of nucleoprotein surrounded by the capsid proteins, which in turn are encased in a membranous envelope. T h e genome of enveloped viruses codes directly for the synthesis of proteins and glycoproteins of the viral envelope membrane, which resembles in many ways the m e m b r a n e s of host cells (Guidotti, 1972) . So close is the structural analogy that the biogenesis of viral membrane has been taken as a most effective model for the generation of cellular m e m b r a n e (cf. Dales and M o s b a c h , 1968; Ben-Porat and Kaplan, 1972; David, 1973) .\n\nT h e same general picture emerges from the study of myxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, rhabdoviruses, herpesviruses, poxviruses, and oncornaviruses (Eiserling and Dickson, 1972 ; see also references cited in Tables II and I I I ) : (i) T h e virus genome codes directly for the formation of specific proteins of the viral m e m b r a n e , while perhaps only indirectly contributing to the composition of the lipid moiety.\n\n(ii) Viral envelope polypeptides and glycoproteins are synthesized within the cytoplasm of the cell and are then transported from the machinery of synthesis to the site of maturation (be it nuclear or cytoplasmic).\n\n(iii) Viral envelope proteins b e c o m e associated with m e m b r a n e lipid either before, or in the process of, becoming a part of the membrane site of maturation. Heine et al., 1972; Roizman et al., 1973; Nahmias et al., 1972; Tevethia et al., 1972; Rapp, 1973 Heine et al., 1972 , Roizman et al., 1973 , Nahmias et al., 1972 . Rapp, 1973 Klein, 1972 zur Hausen, 1972 Klein, 1972 Klein, 1972 Nazerian, 1973 (Rapp, 1973) . \n\n(iv) Viral envelope proteins can be detected (by biochemical and immunological methods) as an integral component of the plasmalemma of infected cells before virion maturation begins.\n\n(v) T h e surface biology and biochemistry of host cells is profoundly altered when viral envelope proteins are inserted into the plasma membrane. This is reflected in an altered immunopathology and in the reaction of infected cells with lectins.\n\nT h u s enveloped viruses can modify the reactivity of cells by coding for the synthesis of specific proteins and glycoproteins which become an integral part of the cell surface. T h e myxoviruses, and some of the paramyxoviruses, are potentially effective in such functions by virtue of the fact that they carry a neuraminidase as a virion component (cf. D r z eniek, 1972). T h e s e enzymes have the ability to remove sialic acid from complex carbohydrate residues at the cell surface, thereby altering the immunological, biochemical, and biophysical properties of cells, their capacity to react with neighboring cells, and their progression through metabolic events of the cell cycle (cf. Weiss, 1973) .\n\nUnlike the enveloped viruses, those without a lipoprotein-glycoprotein coat appear not to have a direct effect on the synthesis of molecules that become a part of the plasma m e m b r a n e or other membranous cell constituents. T h e y may, however, indirectly bring about the turnover of membrane components, particularly in association with infection and release of virus from cells (Allison, 1971; Poste, 1970; Dales, 1973a,b; Medzon, 1973) or with transmission of virus from cell to cell. A s noted above, these p h e n o m e n a will not be discussed further because they do not appear to provide a mechanism for the stable alteration of the surface of surviving cells.\n\nW h e n one considers the biological consequences of cell surface modulation by viruses, it is clear that most instances of productive infection are of little direct relevance to the phenomenon of viral oncogenesis because the affected cell dies. T h e r e are, however, at least three types of virus-cell interaction in which host cells would survive, but with virusdetermined biochemical alteration of the cell surface. T h e s e include (i) cells which have established a carrier state and continue to bud off 13 . VIRUS MODIFICATION AND TRANSFORMATION 381 complete or defective enveloped virions from the cell surface (e.g., Bradburne and Tyrrell, 1971 ; H o w a t s o n , 1970; Lunger and Clark, 1972; M a t s u m o t o , 1972; Higashi, 1973) ; (ii) abortively infected cells in which are expressed those functions determining synthesis and movement to the surface of viral envelope proteins (cf. Poste, 1970) ; and (iii) cells infected with virus that is a mutant in some terminal function of the replication cycle, but which does express those functions that modify the cell surface (e.g., N a g a t a et ai, 1972).\n\nT h e s e observations are especially important in assessing the potential for oncogenic conversion by viruses. T h e y lead to an appreciation of a major difference between oncogenic and nononcogenic viruses, even within the same class. T u m o r viruses can function as donors of genetic information (perhaps even as transducing agents) (cf. Luria, 1959) . Cells that survive infection by the oncogenic viruses and undergo stable transformation are known to carry virus D N A as an integral part of the chromosomal D N A (Winocour, 1971; Sambrook, 1972; Temin, 1972;  T o d a r o and H u e b n e r , 1972; zur H a u s e n , 1972, 1973) . This would provide a fourth, and perhaps most efficient, method whereby surface metabolism of host cells could be stably modified.\n\nW e now know that virus transformation is a two-step process analagous to that illustrated in Fig. 1 . G e n e t i c transformation, which results from incorporation of virus genetic material into the chromosomal D N A , is necessary but not sufficient to produce a neoplastically transformed cell. It requires in addition phenotypic expression of a virus function which ultimately modifies the surface of the affected cell. It is the cell surface that embodies a key lesion of neoplastic transformation, for it mediates those p h e n o m e n a of cell-cell interaction that underlie both normal and cancerous growth and development (see Table I ).\n\nT o understand the mechanism of oncogenesis by viruses, it is of importance to establish which, if any, virus genes participate in neoplastic conversion and how these interact with genes for cell surface biogenesis. A t the biochemical level the problem b e c o m e s one of defining the chemical basis of the physiological surface modification to permit identification of the metabolic processes involved. \n\nT h e r e seems little doubt that genetic information for modulation of cell surface macromolecules is carried by the genome of oncogenic viruses. Such a conclusion derives from the following observations: (i) Infectious nucleic acid, isolated from highly purified virus, brings about transformation both in vivo and in vitro (Ito, 1962; cf. Crawford, 1969; cf. Sambrook, 1972 ; G r a h a m and van der E b , 1973). (ii) Infection and transformation by these viruses is sensitive to high energy irradiation and mutagenic chemicals (cf. Sachs, 1967; E d d y , 1969; Sambrook, 1972; Vogt, 1972) . Because the capacity for viral replication is more sensitive to these damaging agents than is the ability to transform cells, it seems likely that information for the latter function resides only in a segment of viral genome, (iii) Recently a correlation has been established between the nucleic acid composition of various isolates of R S V and their capacity to replicate and/or transform host cells (cf. D u e s b e r g and Vogt, 1973) . (iv) Some of the surface alterations characteristic of transformed cells are expressed early in cells infected productively or abortively, by oncogenic virus (Ben-Bassat et ai, 1970; H \u00e4 y r y and Girardi and Defendi, 1970 ; H a k o m o r i et al., cf. Eckhart, 1972; cf. Benjamin, 1972) . (v) Mutants of these viruses have been isolated [polyoma (cf. Eckhart, 1972; Benjamin, 383 1972; Sambrook, 1972) , Rous sarcoma virus (cf. Vogt, 1972) , and murine leukemic-sarcoma virus (cf. Vogt, 1972 ; M c C a r t e r et al., 1974) ] which cannot transform cells under nonpermissive conditions and which elicit specific, virus-determined cell surface changes only u n d e r permissive conditions.\n\nClearly, there is ample data implicating the virus genome as the repository of information for neoplastic transformation. T h e problem to be posed concerns the nature of this information. D o e s it code for specific molecules that are continually elaborated and incorporated into the plasma m e m b r a n e ? O r does it simply provide for alteration of the pattern of regulation of cellular metabolic p a t h w a y s ? Somatic cell genetics, not yet at a stage that is amenable to sophisticated analysis, has permitted the isolation of cell variants that do shed light on the present problem. M a n y revertants of virus-transformed cells have been isolated and studied at the genetic, physiological, and biochemical levels (cf. Macpherson, 1 9 7 1 ; W y k e , 1971; N o m u r a et al., Sambrook, 1972; Stephenson et al., 1973 ; Y a m a m a t o et ai, 1973). Some were free of detectable virus genome, indicating the essential contribution of virus. H o w e v e r , other revertants did still carry virus genetic information but were phenotypically normal. T h e s e observations suggested a delicate interplay of virus and cellular genome in maintaining the transformed state.\n\nTemperature-sensitive variants of virus-transformed cells have been obtained that do not express the transformed cell phenotype at the nonpermissive temperature ( N o o n a n et al., Renger and Basilico, 1972) . A s far as can be ascertained, the virus genome remained associated with these cells and appeared not to be temperature sensitive.\n\nT h e s e studies suggested that the virus genome coding for transformation does so through interaction with cell genetic information that determines structure and function of surface molecules. With the early demonstration that virus genome acts in this way, one turned with some confidence to seek out its biochemical expression. A s will be noted below, the experimental harvest was bountiful in the extreme, proving something of an embarrassment. It became increasingly difficult to account for the very large number of changes observed in association with virus transformation with the available genetic repository. This is particularly so in the case of the smaller papilloma and papovaviruses [and even adenoviruses (see Tables II and III) ], with genome molecular weights of 2 to 5 x 10 6 daltons. This relatively small amount of D N A , which must code for some seven (or more) virion and nonvirion proteins (cf. Sambrook, 1972) , is unable to a c c o m m o d a t e each component change shown in Tables I and I V , if indeed each depends upon the expression of an unique virus gene sequence. T h e available genetic analyses suggest that two gene products at most could serve this function (cf. Sachs, 1967; Eckhart, 1972; Benjamin, 1972) .\n\nT h e results obtained in studies designed to understand the biochemical basis of the altered cell surface physiology associated with viral oncogenesis, are briefly summarized in Table I V . T h e y embrace a large number of individual biochemical changes, from those involving terminal sialic acid residues at the extreme cell periphery inward to the internal plasma membrane components.\n\nO u r own studies compare the surface structure of control 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, and those transformed by polyoma virus and S V 4 0 , at the level of the glycoprotein at the extreme periphery of the cell and the proteins, glycoproteins, and glycolipids of the underlying plasma membrane. T h e s e two plasmalemma domains are most easily defined in terms of the model shown in Fig. 2 . A s suggested by Singer and Nicolson (1972) the plasma membrane is considered to be comprised of a lipid bilayer into which are inserted globular proteins and glycoproteins. T h e extreme periphery, or surface component, of the cells can be defined as that portion of the plasmalemma which is sensitive to treatment with enzymes, under conditions that leave the cells with the underlying plasma membrane functionally intact with respect to the maintenance of cellular integrity and the transport of nutrients for survival.\n\nIn our studies, trypsin has been used to define these two plasmalemma domains. T h u s , treatment of cells with this e n z y m e (see Fig. 2 ) was shown to release surface glycoprotein from the extreme periphery of cells. This left the underlying plasma m e m b r a n e intact, as indicated by the fact that the plating efficiency of treated cells was unaltered, as was their uptake of nonvital stains (cf. O n o d e r a and Sheinin and Onodera, 1970) . Figure 3 illustrates the operational definition employed for surface glycoprotein. It relies on the fact that 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (as well as most other animal cells), when grown to confluence, are in a pseudo-G-1 phase of growth. If subcultured with trypsin, and plated at subconfluent concentrations, they will grow synchronously and immediately regenerate their surface glycoprotein. If such cultures are incubated with radioactive G l c N H 2 at 12-13 hours post-plating, this precursor is preferentially incorporated into surface glycoprotein. Such specifically labeled surface glycoprotein can be isolated, purified, and characterized (cf. Glycoproteins at the periphery of the plasma membrane Polyoma, SV40 Wu et ai, 1969; Meezan et ai, 1969; Onodera and Sheinin, 1970; Greenberg and Glick, 1972; cf. Warren et ai, 1973 RSV cf.

Sheinin et ai, 1 9 7 1 ; Sheinin and Onodera, 1972) . Recently w e have applied a procedure developed by Mr. Svein Carlsen (Ontario C a n c e r Institute) to produce plasma m e m b r a n e preparations carrying almost all of the surface glycoprotein (Sheinin et ai, 1973 H ] G l c N H 2 at 12-13 hours postplating, this precursor is very largely incorporated into surface macromolecules shown to be glycoprotein. Sheinin and Onodera, 1970; Sheinin et al., 1973) . 13 . VIRUS MODIFICATION AND TRANSFORMATION 387 polyoma and S V 4 0 viruses. T h e physiological properties of these cells (3T3-Py6, 3 T 3 -S V 4 7 9 , 3 T 3 -S V C E 5 6 , 3 T 3 -S V A 2 6 ) have been described elsewhere (cf. Yogeeswaran et aL, 1972) . T h e surface glycoprotein, as released from cells by sonic vibration and purified, was recovered as a soluble component, which remains in the supernatant after sedimentation at 105,000 g for 3 hours. This fraction exhibited heterogeneity when examined by Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (cf. Sheinin et aL, 1973) , with a major fraction moving very slowly through the gels in the region of material having molecular weights in excess of 10 5 daltons. W h e n subjected to sedimentation in neutral sucrose density gradients [ 5 -2 0 % (w/w), 16 hours at 23,000 rpm at 2\u00b0C) the greatest proportion of the surface glycoprotein exhibited an apparent molecular weight of about 62,000 daltons . T h e surface glycoprotein, excluded from beads of Sephadex G-200, was barely included after treatment with 8 M urea (Sheinin et aL, 1973) .\n\nT h e biochemical properties of the surface glycoprotein fraction of control and virus-transformed cells, uncovered to date, are summarized in Table V . Of particular interest is the finding that all of the surface glycoprotein, as defined herein, is homogeneous in the nature of the linkage between peptide and carbohydrate moieties. Its resistance to alkali, and the enrichment for asparagine (cf. Fr\u00f6hlich, 1972) in the protein suggest that this linkage is between an N-aspartamido residue and a G l c N A c residue. Such a linkage is characteristic of immunoglobulins and other glycoproteins found at the surface of animal cells (cf. Schachter and Roden, 1973) .\n\nComparative analysis of surface glycoprotein derived from 3T3 cells and from 3T3 cells transformed by polyoma and S V 4 0 viruses, revealed that these were not the same . Preliminary amino acid analyses have uncovered no gross qualitative or quantitative differences; however some quantitative variations in carbohydrate content have been detected (Fr\u00f6hlich, 1972) .\n\nT h e latter findings are in general agreement with those of others (listed in Table IV ) in which differences have been observed between glycoproteins at the surface of normal and virus-transformed cells. Although definitive evidence is still to be obtained, it has been suggested that the chain length of the carbohydrate residues may be shorter in the latter situation (Grimes, 1970 ; G r e e n b e r g and Sakiyama and B\u00fcrge, 1972; Warren et aL, 1973) .\n\nF o u r kinds of experiments were performed to compare the compositions of surface glycoprotein-depleted plasma m e m b r a n e preparations obtained from 3T3 cells and virus-transformed 3T3 cells. In the first purified plasma membrane preparations were fully solublized using S D S , 388 ROSE SHEININ , and sialic acid\", but not glucuronic acid 6 7. A full complement of amino acids is present with enrichment of asparagine and aspartic acid 6 8.

T h e solublized material was subjected to electrophoresis in Polyacrylamide gels to resolve some 30-odd peptides, varying in molecular size from about 15,000-200,000 daltons, (Sheinin et ai, 1971; Sheinin, 1972; Sheinin and Onodera, 1972) . T h e summary data shown in Fig. 4 indicated that although the major peptide pattern was similar for various plasma m e m b r a n e preparations, nevertheless significant differences could be observed. In the second group of studies, plasma m e m b r a n e harvested from cells generally labeled with radioactive G l c N H 2 , to tag glycolipids and glycoproteins, were solublized and analyzed as noted above. Quite profound differences were observed between the normal and virus-transformed preparations (Sheinin, 1972; Sheinin and Onodera, 1972) . It seems likely that the components here analyzed by their radioactivity were primarily plasma membrane glycoproteins, although the presence of protein-associated glycolipid was not excluded.\n\nProtein of purified plasma membranes was obtained, solubilized, and analyzed by electrophoresis in Polyacrylamide gels. O n c e again the peptide patterns of the normal and virus-transformed cells were generally similar (Sheinin et al. t 1971 ; Sheinin, 1972; Sheinin and Onodera, 1972) . H o w e v e r significant differences were observed. It was especially interesting to note (Fig. 5) that the peptide patterns for the plasma membrane preparations derived from the three S V40-transformed cells were remarkably similar, perhaps suggesting a primary expression of virus genome.\n\nA closer examination of the electrophoretic patterns shown in Figs. 3 and 4 reveals that the large molecular weight components (running at the Electrophoretograms of plasma membrane preparations of various 3T3 mouse cell types, analyzed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing Polyacrylamide gels. Plasma membrane preparations (depleted of surface glycoprotein) were obtained from 3T3-SV A26, 3T3-SV CE56, 3T3-SV 479, 3T3-Py6, and control 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. These were dissolved in sodium dodecyl sulfate plus mercaptoethanol and analyzed in Polyacrylamide gels as described elsewhere (Sheinin and Onodera, 1972) . Material in 10 \u03bc\\ volumes containing, respectively, 368, 432, 443, 327 and 250 /u,g protein was subjected to electrophoresis at 8 mA/gel for 5-6 hours.

In addition, the low molecular weight protein components, running at the negative end of the gels, are increased.\n\nT h e s e observations obtained with cells transformed by the D N A viruses, polyoma and S V 4 0 , are in general agreement with those recently seen in chick embryo cells relatively early after infection with various isolates of R S V (Stone et al., 1974) , and under permissive conditions with a ts mutant (Wickus et al., 1974) . In addition, the latter infection results in a decrease in the amount of another protein of much lower molecular weight [45,000 daltons (Wickus and Robbins, 1973) ].\n\nIt seemed likely from our studies with G l c N H 2-l a b e l e d plasma membrane preparations (Sheinin and Onodera, 1972 ) that the high molecular weight peptides affected in the course of transformation by polyoma and S V 4 0 viruses are glycoproteins. This conclusion has received strong support from our recent studies (Sheinin et al., 1973) , in which we have were freed of lipid, dissolved in phenol-acetic acid and urea, and analyzed on Polyacrylamide gels containing acetic acid and urea, as described elsewhere (Sheinin and Onodera, 1972) . Preparations derived from 3T3-SV A26, 3T3-SV CE56, 3T3-SV 479, 3T3-Py6, and 3T3 cells contained, respectively, 40.0, 57.6, 56.8, 41.2 and 62.8 \u03bc-g protein.

Plasma m e m b r a n e s o obtained from cells specifically labeled with G l c N H 2 in their surface glycoprotein gave profiles of electrophoresis in which t h e majority of t h e label w a s associated with o n e o r t w o of the large molecular weight peptides.\n\nT h e s e observations add weight t o a conclusion drawn earlier (Onodera a n d , that transformation b y polyoma a n d S V 4 0 viruses results in a change in glycoprotein at the extreme periphery of the plasma membrane. I n this context it is of interest t o note that t h e analogous large molecular weight peptides of plasma membrane from chick e m b r y o cells, which decreased a s a result of transformation b y R S V , also appear t o be a t the external surface of the cells, a s indicated by the fact that they can be labeled using iodination with lactoperoxidase (Podluso et al, 1972; Stone et al, 1974; Wickus et al, 1974) .\n\nT h e final series of experiments in o u r comparison of t h e plasma membranes of normal and virus-transformed 3T3 cells were concerned with the glycolipids, which appear t o b e concentrated primarily in t h e plasma membrane of animal cells Sheinin, 1972; Yogeeswaran et al, 1972 Yogeeswaran et al, , 1973 . A s s a y s of cell extracts, and extracts of plasma m e m b r a n e , again revealed great differences between normal cells and those transformed by polyoma and S V 4 0 viruses. T h e data obtained with one polyoma-and one SV40-transformed cell line were generally in accord with those reported by others (see Table IV ) in that marked simplification of the ganglioside pattern had occurred. H o w e v e r , two other SV40-transformed cell lines exhibited a complex pattern similar to that of control cells, but with a quantitative difference.\n\nW e can as yet say little with precision about the chemical basis underlying the differences observed between the glycoproteins and proteins of the plasma m e m b r a n e s of normal and virus-transformed cells. Analyses of glycolipids does indicate that at least in some virus-transformed cells the gangliosides have shorter and less complex carbohydrate chains, carrying fewer sialic acid residues. T h e s e observations and those of others are in accord with the hypothesis that formation of the more complex, highly sialyl-substituted gangliosides is modified in virustransformed cells (cf. H a k o m o r i et aL, 1972, 1974) . Similar conclusions, but with less direct evidence, have been drawn with respect to the glycoproteins of such cells.\n\nT h e extensiveness of the surface changes that accompany neoplastic transformation by viruses is evident from the data just described, as well as those summarized in Tables I and I V . A n accommodation of these myriad biochemical changes, with virus genome available for coding for cell surface modulation with transformation, may come from a consideration of the postulate that integrated virus genome interferes with cellular regulatory processes that normally control the formation and turnover of surface molecules (Wallach, 1969 ). Such a model, shown in several forms in Fig. 6 , would readily embrace the following observations.\n\n(i) Virus transformation is associated with the appearance of species-, tissue-, or even cell-specific surface alterations, which seem not to be mediated by virus genome (cf. H a u g h t o n and N a s h , 1969; cf. Alexander, 1972; cf. Tillack, 1972) .\n\n(ii) Cells that undergo virus transformation suffer a derepression of certain pathways of surface molecule synthesis. T h e s e , normally operative in cells during embryonic life, are repressed during subsequent differentiation (cf. Sachs, 1967; Boyse and Old, 1969 ; H a k o m o r i and 392\n\nFIG. 6. Models for modulation of metabolism of surface molecules by oncogenic viruses. GP, gene product; i, for integration; t, for transformation. . T h e end products of such metabolic sequences, present on both embryonic and transformed cells, are embraced within the general class of oncofetal antigens (cf. Alexander, 1972) .\n\n(iii) During the in vitro growth of normal cells, the formation of plasma m e m b r a n e constituents is carefully regulated such that the formation of m e m b r a n e phospholipids (cf. M c M u r r a y and Magee, 1972), neutral lipids (Bosmann and Winton, 1970; cf. Spector, 1972) , glycolipids (cf. Bosmann and Winton, 1970 and , and glycoproteins (Bosmann and Winton, 1970 ; O n o d e r a and cf. Kraemer, 1971 ; N o w a k o w s k i et al., cf. Warren, 1972) assumes different patterns throughout the growth cycle. Of importance is the finding that such a shift in metabolic activity is not exhibited by virus-transformed cells.\n\n(iv) Regulation of cell surface formation may be seen in the fact that the core plasma m e m b r a n e is synthesized primarily at one stage of the cell cycle (Sheinin and Onodera, 1973; Pasternak et al, 1974 , whereas specific glycolipid (cf. H a k o m o r i et al., Warren et al., 1972; Sakiyama and Robbins, 1973) , glycoprotein (Sheinin and Onodera, 1973) , and protein (Kiehn and Holland, 1970; Onodera, 1970, 1973; cf. Warren, 1972; Pasternak et al, 1974) reactive groups appear to be inserted or mobilized at other, but equally specific, periods. Some properties of virus-transformed cells mimic those of cells which have not completed their full cycle of duplication (Shoham and Sachs, 1972; cf. Burger, 1973) .\n\n(v) N o r m a l cells exhibit many of the properties of virus-transformed cells, if they are first subjected to very gentle treatment with proteolytic enzymes (cf. Burger, 1973) . Recently evidence has been obtained suggesting that in virus-transformed cells, plasma membrane-associated proteases may be more active than in normal cells (cf. Burger, 1973; Schnebli, 1974) .\n\n(vi) A number of agents are known which, in normal cells, evoke many of the pleiotypic surface alterations exhibited by virus-transformed cells (cf. K r a m et al., 1973). In addition, virus-transformed cells selected for reversion with respect to one altered surface function can be at least partially reverted with respect to others (Wollman and Sachs, 1972; Wright, 1973) .\n\nT h e model that invokes modification of cellular reactions of formation of cell surface, as a primary mechanism of phenotypic expression of integrated genome of oncogenic viruses, is an agreeable one. It permits one to consolidate what has often appeared to be an enormous amount of unrelated data showing great changes in surface physiology and biochemistry as a consequence of virus transformation. It is no longer necessary to try to force agreement from different cell types (at various stages of differentiation) transformed by the same, or even different, viruses. Clearly, if the virus genes of transformation code for a product that interferes at the level of regulation of cellular pathways, then one might expect to observe great variability depending upon the cell under study. Since major structural and functional cell surface molecules are glycolipids and glycoproteins (cf. Winzler, 1970) , it is not surprising to find that the metabolism of these molecules is severely affected by transformation.\n\nH o w e v e r , the key problems still remain unresolved. What is the virus gene product that so severely affects the metabolism of surface molecules in transformed cells? A n d what is its primary biochemical target? T h e second question may prove to be the more difficult to answer, since the target may vary from cell to cell. Already a number of postulates have been proposed, none of which has proved entirely satisfactory. T h e metabolism of c A M P , with its extremely far-reaching consequences for growth and development, has received a great deal of attention (Burger et ai, 1972; Johnson and Pastan, 1972; Otten et ai, 1972) , as have transport of nutrients and their regulation of metabolic events (cf. Holley, 1972) . Recently the focus has shifted to regulation of function of surface-associated enzymes, the normal action of which may be to modulate surface structure and function (Roseman, 1970; Roth et al., 1971; Roth and White, 1972; Burger, 1973) .\n\nPerhaps the evidence may yet enforce the still very attractive suggestion (cf. H a k o m o r i et al., 1972) that the synthesis of the complex heteroglycopolymers (glycolipids and glycoproteins) is curtailed or modified by the virus gene product for transformation. This hypothesis rests directly on chemical evidence described above. In addition it leans on the physiological data concerning altered lectin-binding sites, receptors, antigen reactivity, cell-cell interactions of contact inhibition, adhesion and junction formation, many of which are known to be mediated by glycoproteins and glycolipids of the cell surface (cf. Winzler, 1970;  and references cited in Table I ). In apparent support of this hypothesis have c o m e studies on specific glycopeptidyl and glycolipid glycosyltransferases (Grimes, 1970; D e n et al., 1971; Kijimoto and Hakomori, 1971; cf. Brady et al., 1973; Warren et al., 1972; Schengrund et ai, 1973) which show that the level of activity of these enzymes is lower (to the extent of 2-to 11-fold) in virus-transformed cells as compared with normal cells. H o w e v e r whether the decreased enzyme activity is a primary effect of virus transformation, or results from feedback control or repression, is not at all clear. T h e variations in enzyme activity observed are relatively small, considering the fact that the activity of glycopeptidyl-GlcNAc and sialyl transferases have been observed to vary by as much as 20-fold in 3 T 3 cells and 3 T 3 -S V 4 7 9 cells as they move through the cell cycle (R. Sheinin and H . Schachter, unpublished, 1972) .\n\nPerhaps there is a c o m m o n target in all cell types for the action of the genes of transformation of the oncogenic viruses. It is to be hoped that this will emerge from studies with normal and virus-transformed cell variants in which surface expression can be regulated by moving from permissive to nonpermissive conditions. Similar expectations lie with revertants and re-revertants of virus-transformed cells (cf. Macpherson, 1971; M c N u t t et al. y 1973; Y a m a m o t o et ai, 1973) .\n\nTurning to the question of the nature of the gene product for transformation, here too the possibilities may be several, depending upon the virus in question. F o r example, the simplest explanation for the action of genome of enveloped viruses is that a portion of the information for viral envelope is transmitted continuously in transformed cells, giving rise to the biogenesis of virion envelope as an integral part of the plasmalemma. Although this possibility cannot be ruled out as an essential component of the mechanism for cell surface modulation by the particular microorganisms involved, it is made less likely by the following observations.\n\n(i) In the case of every tumor virus, neoplastic cells have been derived in which no trace of virus gene product can be detected.\n\n(ii) Virus mutants have been isolated [from R S V (Martin, 1970; Kawai and Hanafusa, 1971 ) and from polyoma virus (cf. Eckhart, 1972; Benjamin, 1972) ] in which the mutated gene does not define a virion peptide, but does determine a protein that is required for maintenance of the transformed cell phenotype.\n\nO u r knowledge of the reactions of plasma m e m b r a n e biogenesis are still rudimentary. N e w avenues of biochemical and biophysical analysis of the cell surface are now opening up. T h e s e , coupled with the powerful tools of virus mutants and somatic cell variants, should permit the development of a clear picture of the synthesis, structural relationships, and structural-functional relationships of surface molecules. F r o m such studies will undoubtedly issue a sharper comprehension of the mechanism of viral oncogenesis as it is expressed in modulation of the surface metabolism of host cells."}
