{"title": "Strategies for the Identification of novel inhibitors of deubiquitinating enzymes", "body": "The conjugation of Ubiquitin (Ub) and Ubiquitin-like (UBL) proteins is an important regulatory mechanism that is widespread in many biological processes [1] . The assorted diseases associated with these pathways make the pathway enzymes particularly interesting for therapeutic targets. The UPS has been validated with the approval of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib for the treatment of multiple myeloma; however, significant toxicities were seen during clinical trials suggesting the need for more selective targets [2] . Ub-and UBL-isopeptidases represent a unique set of drug targets in the UPS that are responsible for removing ubiquitin and UBLs, such as, SUMO, NEDD8, and ISG15, from target proteins, thus affecting the targets fate [3] . To develop therapeutic agents that target isopeptidases we developed a readily quantifiable novel isopeptidase assay platform that is suitable for highthroughput screening (HTS). The assay platform consists of Ub or UBL fused to the reporter enzyme phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2 ). Isopeptidase activity releases PLA 2 that cleaves its substrate generating a signal that is linear with isopeptidase concentration and is able to discriminate DUB, deSUMOylase, deNEDDylase and deISGylase activities. The assay can be successfully employed to screen for inhibitors of isopeptidases.\n\nThe approval of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (velcade) for the treatment of multiple myeloma validated targeting of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPS) for the treatment of cancer [4] . However, extended treatment with bortezomib is associated with toxicity and drug resistance, limiting its efficacy [2] . In contrast, therapeutic strategies that target specific aspects of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway upstream of the proteasome, would be predicted to have lower toxicity. While activating enzymes (E1) and conjugating enzymes (E2) are upstream of the proteasome one must be aware of the consequences of targeting them, as disruption of the E1 leads to cell cycle arrest [5] and E2s have been shown to be required for development [6] . Targeting the ubiquitin activating enzyme may be predicted to affect too many cellular functions for it to be tolerated by normal cells; yet targeting the Nedd8-activiating enzyme for inhibition has been reported to be successful in pre-clinical studies [7] . The mechanism of action is most likely through inactivation of the cullin-based E3 ligases, many of which play a crucial role in cell cycle checkpoints whose disruption would have a more immediate effect on rapidly dividing cancer cells.\n\nE3 ligases, with only a limited number of substrates represent attractive drug targets in the UPS. One of the most interesting E3 targets is the Skp1-Cul1-Roc-Fbox Protein complex (SCF). The SCF complex consists of many variable F-box adaptor proteins each of which target only a few substrates for ubiquitination [8] . Two therapeutically relevant Fbox proteins are Skp2 [9] and \u03b2-TRCP [10] , which play key roles in cell cycle progression. However, to inhibit these proteins one must disrupt a protein-protein interaction, which is considered a more difficult target than an enzymatic target.\n\nIsopeptidases belong to five subfamilies that have been identified to date. Four of these five families are cysteine proteases, which have been shown to be good therapeutic targets. The ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCH); ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBP/USP); Machado-Joseph Domain (MJD); and ovarian tumor related (OTU) isopeptidases are cysteine proteases while the JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme (JAMM) motif dubs are Zn metaloproteases. 90 putative DUBs have been identified with 79 most likely being functional. There are also many UBL-isopeptidases that are good therapeutic targets [3, 11] .\n\nSeveral isopeptidases have been implicated in disease [12] , in particular cancer (refer to Table 1 ). For example, ubiquitin-specific protease 7, also known as herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease (USP7/HAUSP), regulates the ubiquitination state of the RINGfinger E3 ligase Mdm2 (and its human homolog Hdm2) [13] . Hdm2 targets the tumor suppressor p53 for ubiquitination and facilitates its degradation by the proteasome [14, 15] . Many other RING-finger E3 ligases are capable of auto-ubiquitination; Hdm2 is no exception and auto-ubiquitinates resulting in its own proteolytic degradation [16] . However, Hdm2 also ubiquitinates p53 resulting in degradation of p53 via the proteasome. Initially, USP7 was believed to primarily deubiquitinate p53, increasing the level of p53 [17] . However, more recent genetic and biochemical studies have found that with respect to p53 and Hdm2, the primary target of USP7 is Hdm2 [13, 18] . These data were corroborated by structural biology studies which revealed that Hdm2 and p53 recognize the tumor necrosis factor-receptor associated factor (TRAF) domain of USP7 in a mutually exclusive manner, but Hdm2 binds to the TRAF domain with a higher affinity than p53 [19] .\n\nWhile DUBs have received the most attention, proteases that deconjugate UBLs from their target proteins have also been linked to various pathophysiologies, as they are critical to cellular localization, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction pathways, and the regulation of some ubiquitin E3 ligases [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .\n\nMany assays currently in use rely on cleavage of linear Ub-fusions, which can be produced in E.coli (tetra-Ub, Ub-CEP52, Ub-GSTP1, Ub-DHFR, Ub-PESTc, etc.) or synthesized chemically [25] [26] [27] . For small scale analysis of isopeptidase activity, reaction products are analyzed by gel electrophoresis, or are selectively precipitated and analyzed by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Gel-based procedures are labor intensive and expensive, and while scintillation counting approaches are quantitative and allow processing of larger numbers of samples than gel-based assays, they require centrifugation and recovery of supernatant. For HTS, a fluorogenic substrate, Ub-AMC (Ub-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin), has been employed in some cases, as well as a similar substrate, the tetrapeptide z-LRGG-AMC, which mimics the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin [28] . A limiting factor with both of these fluorescent substrates is the fact that this small adduct cannot be hydrolyzed efficiently by the largest class of DUBs, Ub-specific protease (UBP/USP) class enzymes. Moreover, the excitation wavelength of Ub-AMC is in the UV range, which is known to excite a number of screening compounds and give rise to up to 20% false positives [29] . Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) has also been developed for HTS screens [30] . Both AMC and FRET, however, suffer from the need for specialized custom reagents and equipment, as well as from difficulty in adapting to a multi-well plate format from which the endpoints can be read directly. In many of these approaches, expensive doublelabeled or tagged substrates must be generated specifically for each assay (refer to Table 2 for comparison of current technologies).\n\nWhile isopeptidases have been of interest for some time to our knowledge no compounds have entered clinical trials. One reason for this could be the assays employed in drug discovery campaigns. All of the previously described platforms are based on Ub linked to small chemical adducts and are not related to the physiologic target of most isopeptidases, mono-or poly-ubiquitin fused to a protein. To fulfill the need for a convenient and physiologically relevant assay that is suitable for high throughput screening, Progenra has developed an isopeptidase assay, based on the observation that most USPs can hydrolyze linear Ub fusions (\u03b1-NH bond) as well as \u03b5-NH 2 -isopeptide linkages, that exploits the requirement of certain proteins for a free N-terminus to be active. This assay can be used for either DUBs or ULPs.\n\nThe UBL-PLA 2 assay is based on the concept that PLA 2 requires a free amino terminus to be catalytically active. PLA 2 cleaves phospholipids to produce lysophospholipids and free fatty acids and requires a free N-terminus for catalytic activity [31] . When PLA 2 is fused to a UBL it is inactive and cannot cleave it substrate. When a DUB or other UBL isopeptidase is present it cleaves the UBL from PLA 2 , freeing PLA 2 to act on its substrate. There are a number of commercial substrates for PLA 2 including the fluorescent phospholipid 2-(4,4difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-pentanoyl)-1-hexadecanoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine (\u03b2-BODIPY C 5 -HPC) and 2-(6-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4yl)amino)hexanoyl-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBD C 6 -HPC). The fluorescence response produced by these substrates occurs over a wavelength range that is better suited for drug discovery than that employed in the Ub-AMC assay, and it is amplified by the coupling of DUB catalytic activity to PLA 2 , resulting in enhanced sensitivity. Importantly, the Ub/ UBL-PLA 2 fusion proteins represent more physiological substrates than the short carboxy terminal adducts exemplified by the commercially available AMC or TR-FRET reagents.\n\nTo our knowledge, no DUB inhibitors have entered clinical trials. However, modulation of the DUB CYLD pathway with aspirin has been shown to be therapeutically viable in humans [32, 33] . Progenra's proprietary assay technology has been used by multiple groups to screen more than 100,000 compounds to date with that number expected to double by the end of 2008. Due to the increasing screening that is being performed against isopeptidases by ourselves and other researchers we anticipate that multiple DUB inhibitors will enter the clinic in the near future.
