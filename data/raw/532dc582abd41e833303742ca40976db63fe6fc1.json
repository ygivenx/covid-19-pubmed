{"title": "Classification: Biological Sciences Minor: Microbial Biology Site specific target binding controls RNA cleavage efficiency by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus endonuclease SOX", "body": "Viral infection dramatically reshapes the gene expression landscape of the host cell. By changing overall messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance or translation, viruses can redirect host machinery towards viral gene expression while simultaneously dampening immune stimulatory signals (1) (2) (3) . Suppression of host gene expression, termed host shutoff, can occur via a variety of mechanisms, but one common strategy is to accelerate degradation of mRNA (1, 2) . This occurs during infection with DNA viruses such as In cells, the mRNA fragments resulting from the primary SOX endonucleolytic cleavage are predominantly cleared by the host 5'-3' exonuclease XRN1, while in vitro, RNA fragments are rapidly degraded by 5'-3' exonucleolytic activity intrinsic to purified SOX (9) . Thus, it has been challenging to analyze the initial endonucleolytic cleavage event that is an essential component of mRNA target specificity in vivo. Here, we sought to develop a biochemical system to address these questions.\n\nOur prior analysis of SOX targets in cells identified the human LIMD1 mRNA, which codes for a protein essential for P body formation and integrity, as being highly susceptible to cleavage by SOX (20). The minimum sequence required to directly cut the putative cleavage site in LIMD1 in cells was mapped to a 54 nucleotide segment (LIMD1 54), and we therefore chose this as our model substrate to study SOX targeting in vitro (20) . We first expressed and purified KSHV SOX to greater then 95 percent purity from SF9 insect cells ( fig. S1A ). Using the LIMD1 54 substrate, we plotted the observed rate constant (k obs ) as a function of SOX concentration, yielding a Hill coefficient of n = 1.11 ( Fig. 1A) . Thus, in agreement with previous observations (9, 10) , SOX appears to function predominantly as a monomer. Under conditions of half maximal activity (2 \u00b5M; Fig. 1A ), SOX displayed a strong preference for the \"hard\" divalent metal Mg 2+ and a weaker preference for the \"softer\" and larger metals Mn 2+ , Co 2+ , and Zn 2+ (Fig. 1B) . This is again consistent with other characterized members of the P/DExK family of enzymes (9, 22) .\n\nNotably, SOX activity in the presence of Mg 2+ was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner upon competitive addition of Ca 2+ (Fig. 1C and S1B ). This is likely the result of increased coordination partners engaged by Ca 2+ , which decreases the ability of catalytic residues to promote proper base hydrolysis (23-25). Finally, increasing the NaCl concentration above 100 mM led to substantially decreased SOX activity (Fig. 1D ), in accordance with the observation that high salt concentrations frequently inhibit nuclease activity by disrupting protein-protein or protein-substrate interactions (25). Given that recombinant SOX displays robust 5'-3' exonuclease activity (9, 10) , we sought to confirm that LIMD1 54 was subject to endonucleolytic SOX cleavage, as this is the predominant event that directs mRNA turnover in SOX expressing cells (3, 16) . Both the 5' and 3' ends LIMD1 54 were blocked by capping the 5' end with a Cy5 fluorophore and the 3' end with an Iowa Black quencher (LIMD1 54 Flo). We confirmed this RNA was resistant to degradation by the 5'-phosphate dependent exonuclease terminator (Fig. 1E, lane 3) . However, in the presence of SOX, a cleavage product was observed that correlated with an endonucleolytic cut (Fig. 1E, lane 2) .\n\nTo confirm this processing event was not a result of contamination, we purified a SOX mutant containing mutations within two key residues of the SOX active site (D221N/E244Q). Incubation of this mutant with LIMD1 54 over the course of 1.5 h yielded no RNA cleavage (Fig. S1C) . Thus, recombinant SOX appears to target LIMD1 54 for endonucleolytic cleavage in vitro, as has been observed for this substrate in cells.\n\nTo analyze RNA substrate selectivity using our in vitro assay, we first compared SOX degradation of LIMD1 54 to a 51-nucleotide sequence of the mRNA encoding GFP (GFP 51). We have previously shown that GFP mRNA is cleaved by SOX in cells, and that GFP 51 is the minimal sequence required to elicit cleavage (15, 16) . The cleavage sites for LIMD1 54 and GFP 51 are predicted to occur in an open loop region ( Fig. 2A , red arrow). Upon direct comparison of these two RNAs, we observed a 5-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency of SOX for the LIMD1 54 substrate compared to GFP 51 (Fig. 2B) .\n\nThis difference was not exclusively due to the fact that the GFP substrate was slightly shorter than LIMD1 54, as SOX also displayed a 2.5-fold reduction of catalytic efficiency on a longer, 100 nt GFP substrate (GFP 100; Fig. 2B ). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) further revealed a 10-fold increase in SOX binding to LIMD1 54 compared to GFP 51 (Fig. 2C) . Given that both substrates contain the requisite unpaired bulge at the predicted cleavage site (see Fig. 2A ), these observations suggest that additional sequence or structural features impact SOX targeting efficiency on individual RNAs.\n\nTwo SOX point mutants, P176S and F179A, located in an unstructured region of the protein that bridges domains I and II have been shown to be selectively required for its endonucleolytic processing of RNA substrates (Fig S2A and S2B ) (8, 21) . Structural data indicate that residue F179 forms a stacking interaction with an adenine base in the RNA, likely stabilizing the protein-RNA interaction, while P176 is hypothesized to contribute to structural rearrangements required for F179 engagement (21). We purified both mutants to evaluate their relative RNA processing and RNA binding activity against the optimal LIMD1 54 substrate. Both mutants displayed purity and elution profiles similar to wild type (WT) SOX (see Fig. S1A ). However, the catalytic efficiency of each mutant was >5-fold less than WT SOX (Fig. 2D) . Furthermore, RNA binding was severely perturbed; the binding kinetics of WT SOX for LIMD1 54 are in the single digit nanomolar range (K d = 7 nM), while P176S and F179A display >2 log defects (K d = 702 nM and 831 nM, respectively) ( Fig 2E and S3A-C) . Thus, the large defect in RNA binding likely explains the decreased efficiency of RNA processing. Notably, while there was a dramatic .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/320929 doi: bioRxiv preprint decrease in the relative affinities of the two mutants for LIMD1 54, there was not a complete loss of binding or RNA processing. This could be a result of secondary nonspecific interactions and/or nonspecific exonucleolytic degradation by SOX from the 5' monophosphorylated end of the probe.\n\nIn silico RNA folding predictions of SOX targeting motifs, coupled with RNA mutagenesis experiments, have indicated that an RNA stem loop structure is an important determinant in SOX targeting both in vitro and in vivo (20, 21). Given the importance of this predicted motif, and in particular the proposed requirement for unpaired sequence at the cut site, we sought to experimentally determine the structure of LIMD1 54 using chemical based in-line probing (Fig. 3A ). This showed that the LIMD1 54 structure contains a largely base paired stem region, followed by a loop at positions 15-27 that encompasses the predicted SOX cleavage site between nt 26 and 27, and a short hairpin structure at positions 29-40 (Fig. 3B) . Notably, some differences exist between the predicted and observed structures of LIMD1 54, including a larger loop region and the subsequent short stem-loop (compare Fig. 3B to Fig. 2A ) However, in both cases the predicted cleavage site of SOX resides in a loop region.\n\nRecently, a high-resolution crystal structure was solved of SOX bound to a 31nt fragment of the KSHV pre-microRNA K12-2 (K2-31). In this structure, the only observed contacts between SOX and K2-31 occurred between the four active site residues of SOX .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/320929 doi: bioRxiv preprint (Y373, R248, C247, F179) and the UGAAG motif surrounding the cleavage site of the RNA (21). It was therefore hypothesized that no other residues beyond this unpaired UGAAG motif were involved in transcript recognition (21). However, our data showing a 10-fold difference in binding affinity between two in vivo validated SOX substrates suggested that a more extended interaction surface might distinguish optimal from suboptimal RNA substrates. We therefore used RNA footprinting to map the SOX binding sites on LIMD1 54. Indeed, SOX robustly protected 3 LIMD1 54 adenosines (positions 20-24) from RNase I digestion in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 4) . Notably, this mapped binding site is the same one predicted from in vivo PARE-seq data (20). We also observed a modest protection of base 27 (G) located directly adjacent to the predicted cleavage site of SOX, which represents the region detected in the crystal structure of K2-31 bound to SOX. Collectively, these findings suggest that while SOX may interact with residues directly adjacent to the cut site, a more extensive interaction interface exists for its preferred in vivo targets.\n\nTo explore the importance of the residues involved in SOX binding and cleavage, we engineered 3 mutants of the LIMD1 54 substrate (Fig. 5A) . First, we preserved the loop structure but replaced the 3 adenosines bound by SOX (residues 39-43) with guanosines (LIMD1 3xA-G). Second, we mutated the residue located at the predicted SOX cut site that was also protected in the footprinting assay (LIMD1 A-G). This mutant has been previously identified to block SOX cleavage in vivo (20). Third, we largely The predicted structures of the LIMD1 3XA-G and LIMD1 zipper mutants were verified by in-line probing (Fig. 5, S6 ). Real-time binding kinetics for SOX with WT LIMD1 54 and each of the 3 mutant substrates were then measured using bio-layer interferometry (BLI).\n\nAll RNA probes were 3' biotinylated and immobilized to a streptavidin-coated BLI probe, whereupon the binding and dissociation of SOX was measured. To prevent degradation of the probe, excess calcium ion was used in place of magnesium ( S4C-D and table S1). We also measured SOX binding to the KSHV pre-miRNA sequence used to obtain the SOX-RNA co-crystal structure (K2-31) (21). Notably, the affinity of SOX for K2-31 was even less than that of the LIMD1 3xA-G and Zipper mutants (K d = 1.8 \u00b5M), suggesting that despite having an UGAAG motif upstream of a predicted bulge, this may not be a bona fide SOX target (Fig. 5B , S4E and table S1).\n\nWe next quantitatively measured the catalytic efficiency of SOX towards each of the above RNA substrates. Despite SOX having WT binding affinity for the predicted cleavage site mutant LIMD1 A-G, there was a 4-fold defect in its ability to degrade this mutant (Fig. 5C ). Even more marked defects in SOX catalytic efficiency were observed for the binding site mutant LIMD1 3XA-G, the loop mutant LIMD1 zipper, and the pre-miRNA K2-31 (Fig. 5C ). Collectively, these data indicate that efficient RNA cleavage requires both an appropriate SOX binding site and a suitable cut site.

Mutagenesis of residues in mapped cleavage sites generally abolishes SOX cleavage at that location (20) . To determine if our in vitro assay faithfully recapitulated the site specificity of SOX endonucleolytic targeting observed in cells, we established reaction conditions that enabled trapping of the early cleavage events. By combining Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ in our reaction buffer, we were able to sufficiently slow SOX processing to visualize cleavage products derived from 5' 32 P labeled substrates. Indeed, we observed a predominant 27 nt band, which is the size of the product released upon LIMD1 54 cleavage at the predicted cut site (Fig. 6A, lane 3) . Additional bands also appeared, likely representing subsequent processing events. Importantly, when we incubate SOX with the cut site mutant LIMD1 A-G, there is a complete loss of this 27 nt product, as well as the additionally processed intermediates (Fig. 6A, lane 4) . Production of these cleavage intermediates required SOX, as no decay was observed in the RNA-only controls (Fig.   6A , lanes 1-2).\n\nFinally, we sought to verify that the predominant 27 nt cleavage product we observed was a result of an endonucleolytic cleavage and not 5' end processing. To this end, we generated a LIMD1 54 substrate containing a 3' 32 P pCp label and a free 5' OH to block 5' end processing. Again, in the presence of SOX, WT LIMD1 54 but not the A-G mutant produced a cleavage product whose size corresponded to cleavage at the predicted site ( Fig 6B) . Taken together, these data confirm that our in vitro assay faithfully recapitulates SOX cleavage site specificity on a true substrate.

Here, through the development of the first biochemical system to faithfully recapitulate the internal cleavage specificity observed for SOX in cells, we revealed how both RNA sequence and structure contribute to targeting. These findings resolve a central feature of the current model of SOX activity ( Figure 7 ). Previous observations established that sequences flanking the cut site were required to direct cleavage by SOX (16, 20) . However, it was unresolved whether they played a strictly structural role in presenting an exposed loop for cleavage, served as a platform for SOX binding, or created a binding site for one or more cellular factors that then indirectly recruited SOX to its targets. Through a combination of mutational analyses, RNA structure probing, and RNA footprinting assays, we showed that efficient SOX targeting requires both an exposed loop structure and upstream sequences that serve as a SOX binding platform. This combination of sequence and structural features within the targeting motif helps explain why some mRNAs are efficiently cleaved by SOX, whereas others are weaker substrates.\n\nA key open question related to SOX function is how it can target the majority of mRNAs in cells, yet with significant site specificity. These observations suggest that there must be specific mRNA features that influence targeting. Indeed, PARE-seq analyses of cleavage intermediates in SOX expressing cells revealed that cleavage sites were associated with a degenerate sequence motif (20). Sequences proximal to the cleavage .

The importance of these sequence features for SOX targeting was validated for the LIMD1 transcript in cells (20). Because LIMD1 has been established as a particularly robust SOX target in cells (20), we reasoned that it must contain features optimal for SOX processing and therefore would be an ideal substrate to dissect these features biochemically. Indeed, SOX binding to LIMD1 54 was 10-fold better than to the commonly used reporter substrate GFP, and an order of magnitude better than to the K2-31 pre-miRNA, which has not been demonstrated to be processed by SOX in cells. Importantly, these binding differences correlated with the efficiency of SOX cleavage in vitro, arguing that the ability to bind the targeting motif is a key step in target recognition. Through RNA footprinting assays, we were able to show that SOX binds to a bulge structure proximal to the cleavage site containing the polyadenosine stretch previously predicted to be important (20). Mutating either the bulge structure (LIMD1 zipper) or maintaining the bulge but mutating the polyadenosine stretch (LIMD1 3xA-G) resulted in an order of magnitude reduction in binding affinity, correlating with a dramatic decrease in cleavage efficiency. Collectively, these data demonstrate that variability in the efficiency of SOX targeting observed in cells is likely due to differences in RNA sequences that mediate SOX binding.\n\nA recent crystal structure of SOX bound to the K2-31 pre-miRNA captured the importance of the exposed loop region for SOX cleavage (21). However, the structure did not reveal additional interactions between SOX and the RNA beyond the 3 residues surrounding the cut site. Our data suggest that this is likely because the K2-31 RNA lacks the additional residues necessary for SOX binding site found in both LIMD1 and GFP.\n\n.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/320929 doi: bioRxiv preprint While the K2-31 RNA does contain adenosines upstream of the cleavage site, structural predictions indicate these residues are within a stem region (21), rather than in an exposed loop as is the case for LIMD1 and GFP. Together, these observations indicate that while upstream adenosines are important for binding, they must be present in an unpaired state to promote SOX binding. It is notable that prior studies reported much weaker interactions between SOX and RNA (K d = 75 \u00b5M) compared to its DNA substrates (K d = 1 \u00b5m) (9, 10, 21). However, in these cases binding assays were conducted with scrambled RNA sequences. We found that SOX binding affinities to RNA substrates vary over several orders of magnitude, in a manner that correlates with cleavage efficiency.\n\nInterestingly, the crystal structure of SOX bound to DNA showed more dynamic interactions along the length of the protein (~480 \u00c5 2 interaction surface), when compared to the K2-31 RNA bound structure (~240 \u00c5 2 interaction surface). It is therefore possible that more interaction along the length of SOX protein might occur with optimal substrates such as LIMD1 that are more tightly bound.\n\nThe fact that purified SOX endonucleolytically cleaved LIMD1 54 at the precise site observed in SOX-expressing cells demonstrates that cleavage site selection on an mRNA is not mediated by a cellular cofactor. Instead, targeting at particular RNA motifs is strongly influenced by the strength of SOX binding. Our observation that the P176S and F179A SOX mutants display significant RNA binding defects indicates that their failure to cleave mRNAs in cells is due to an inability to efficiently bind the targeting motif.\n\nThe mechanism by which SOX initially distinguishes RNA polymerase II The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

More broadly, endonucleases are instrumental in RNA processing and degradation. Nuclease processing defects lead to several human pathologies ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration (26-30), and our study provides a framework for better understanding the mechanistic features governing endonuclease targeting.\n\nKSHV SOX was codon optimized for Sf9 expression and synthesized from GENEWIZ.\n\nSOX was then subcloned using restriction sites BamHI and SalI (New England BioLabs) into pFastBac HTD.

Subsequently, it endonucleolytically cleaves its targets at specific sites, whereupon the fragments are degraded by host exonucleases such as Xrn1 and Dis3L2.\n\nHere, we revealed that in addition to the requirement for an unpaired loop at the cleavage site, additional upstream RNA sequences increase the affinity of SOX for individual targets, thereby controlling cleavage efficiency. \n\nThe sequence surrounding the cut site in LIMD1 was inserted into a pBSSK (-) backbone using the BamHI and XbaI restriction sites.
