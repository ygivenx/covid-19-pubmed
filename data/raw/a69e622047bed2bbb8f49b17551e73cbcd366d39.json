{"title": "Carcinoembryonic Antigen-Related Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 Modulates Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis via an iNKT Cell-Dependent Mechanism", "body": "Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cellular adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) is a CEA family member that has been reported to have an important role in the regulation of Th1-mediated colitis. In this study, we examined the role of CEACAM1 in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Treatment of C57BL/6J mice with CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein, a homophilic ligand of CEACAM1, inhibited the severity of EAE and reduced myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-derived peptide (MOG 35-55 )reactive interferon-\u2425 and interleukin-17 production. In contrast, treatment of these animals with AgB10, an anti-mouse CEACAM1 blocking monoclonal antibody, generated increased severity of EAE in association with increased MOG 35-55 -specific induction of both interferon-\u2425 and interleukin-17. These results indicated that the signal elicited through CEACAM1 ameliorated EAE disease severity. Furthermore, we found that there was both a rapid and enhanced expression of CEACAM1 on invariant natural killer T cells after activation. The effect of CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein and anti-CEACAM1 mAb on both EAE and MOG 35 Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cellular adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), also known as CD66a, is one of the carcinoembryonic antigen family members and is expressed in epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and hematopoietic cells such as monocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, and activated T cells. [1] [2] [3] [4] It is involved in intercellular adhesion through homophilic or heterophilic interactions and mediates regulatory functions in cellular growth and differentiation. Several splice variants of CEACAM1 have been detected, that differ with respect to the number of extracellular immunoglobulinlike domains, membrane anchorage, and the length of their cytoplasmic tail. 3 Isoforms of CEACAM1 with a long cytoplasmic tail (CEACAM1-L) contain two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs and have been shown to negatively regulate epithelial cell activation and tumor cell growth. [3] [4] [5] Recently, the specific function of CEACAM1 as a regulator of T cells has been reported in vitro and in vivo. 6 -12 Mice treated with CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein, a homophilic ligand for CEACAM1 that stimulates the signal from CEACAM1, exhibited an immunosuppressive effect on Th1-mediated colitis in vivo, with reduced interferon (IFN)-\u2425 production and T-bet activation. 12 However, the significance of CEACAM1 on other inflammatory autoimmune disease models remains unclear.\n\nExperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease induced by sensitization against central nervous system (CNS) components such as myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). 13 Because the neurological signs of paralysis can be monitored continuously, and demyelinating lesions resemble those found in multiple sclerosis, EAE is considered an animal model of the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis. [13] [14] [15] [16] Numerous studies have reported that EAE is mediated by CD4 \u03e9 Th1 cells that produce IFN-\u2425. [13] [14] [15] [16] Recently, this idea was questioned because animals deficient in IFN-\u2425, IFN-\u2425 receptor, or signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 were still found to develop EAE. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] These data led the identification of an interleukin (IL)-23 derived population of Th cells, IL-17-producing Th17 cells, as alternative potent inducers of severe autoimmunity, including EAE. [22] [23] [24] However, mice deficient in T-bet and signal transducer and activator of transcription 4, which thus lack Th1 cells, but have large numbers of Th17 cells, are still resistant to EAE. 21, 25 Additionally, Th1 and Th17 cells are observed in the CNS at the peak of EAE and diminish after the recovery. 26 It has now been described that Th1 and Th17 cells might cooperate to induce the development of EAE. [27] [28] [29] Thus, elucidation of the mechanisms that regulate the production of both Th1 and Th17 cytokines is important in relation to the regulation of EAE.\n\nIn this study, we investigated the role of CEACAM1 in EAE either by CEACAM1 ligation with a homophilic ligand for CEACAM1 (CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein), or by blocking with a CEACAM1-specific antibody, AgB10. Here, we demonstrate that signaling through CEACAM1 suppressed MOG-derived peptide (MOG )-induced EAE associated with a reduction in MOG 35-55 -specific T cell production of IFN-\u2425 and IL-17. Moreover, we have identified invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells as a critical component in CEACAM1-mediated suppression of EAE. iNKT cells are an unique subset of CD1-restricted T cells that express an invariant T cell receptor (TCR) \u2423 chain, composed of V\u242314-J\u242418 segments in mice and V\u242314-J\u242418 segments in humans, and use a restricted set of V\u2424 genes. 30 -31 Due to the ability to produce a wide variety of cytokines, iNKT cells are thought to play regulatory roles in autoimmune diseases. 32 CEACAM1-mediated suppression of EAE was not observed in iNKT cell-deficient J\u242318 \u03ea/\u03ea mice, and MOG 35-55 -specific T cell production of IFN-\u2425 and IL-17 was not modified in J\u242318 \u03ea/\u03ea mice when treated with either CECAM1-Fc fusion protein or AgB10.\n\nC57BL/6J (B6) mice were obtained from CLEA Japan Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). J\u242318 \u03ea/\u03ea mice were kindly provided by Dr. M. Taniguchi (RIKEN, Tokyo, Japan). All animals were maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions in accordance with institutional guidelines of National Institute of Neuroscience, Tokyo, Japan. MOG (amino acid sequence, MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK) was synthesized at Toray Research Center (Tokyo, Japan). Incomplete Freund's adjuvant and heat-killed mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Ra) were obtained from Difco Laborato-ries (Detroit, Michigan), and pertussis toxin was obtained from List Biological Laboratories (California). The hybridoma producing CEACAM1-specific antibody, AgB10, 33 was kindly provided by Nicole Beauchemin (McGill Cancer Center), and 293 EBNA cells transfected pCEP4-N-CEACAM-Fc, which produce a homophilic ligand of CEACAM1, CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein were kindly provided by Thomas M. Gallagher (Loyola University Medical Center). 34 \n\nEAE was induced in mice as described previously. 35 Briefly, mice were immunized subcutaneously with 100 g of MOG 35-55 emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant containing 500 g of M. tuberculosis. Directly after the immunization and 48 hours later, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 200 ng of pertussis toxin. Clinical signs of EAE were assessed daily with a 0 to 6 scoring system (0, no signs; 1, partial loss of tail tonicity; 2, completely limp tail and abnormal gait; 3, partial hindlimb paralysis; 4, complete hindlimb paralysis; 5, fore-and hindlimb paralysis or moribund state; 6, dead).\n\nThe hybridomas producing AgB10 were cultured in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 at 37\u00b0C in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 100 U/ml penicillin/ streptomycin. The supernatants were collected and AgB10 was affinity-purified using a protein A column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore, MA). 293 EBNA cells transfected pCEP4-N-CEACAM1-Fc were cultured in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin. CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein was affinity-purified using protein G column from the collected supernatants (Amersham Bioscience, NJ).\n\nAfter immunization with MOG 35-55 , mice were treated intraperitoneally with the indicated compounds, either 250 g of AgB10 or 250 g of control rat IgG antibody (Jackson Immuno Research, PA), or either 250 g of CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein or 250 g of a chimeric (mouse/human) anti-human CD20 mAb (rituximab) every second day from the day of immunization, day 0, to day 11. The animals were sacrificed at day 11 and inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes (LN) were sampled. Total LN cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% syngeneic mouse serum, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 5 \u03eb 10 \u03ea5 M/L 2-mercaptoethanol, and 100 U/ml penicillin/ streptomycin, and were incubated in 96-well plates with 1 \u03eb 10 6 cells/well in the presence of 0, 1, 10, 30, or 100 mg/ml of MOG . Culture supernatant was collected 48 hours after stimulation, and IFN-\u2425 and IL-17 in the supernatant were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using OptEIA kit (BD Bioscience, CA) and IL-17 ELISA kit (R&D systems), respectively.\n\nSixteen days after the immunization with MOG 35-55 , the spinal cords were sampled and stored in 10% formaldehyde. Paraffin-embedded spinal cords were stained with either H&E or luxol fast blue.\n\nLiver mononuclear cells from B6 mice were isolated by Percoll density-gradient centrifugation. 1 \u03eb 10 6 cells/well were stimulated with 1 mg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 mAb and 2.5 mg/ml Concanavalin A (ConA) in 96-well plates and collected for the use of flow cytometry. Cells were stained with \u2423-galactosylceramide (\u2423-GC) loaded dimeric mouse CD1 days followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated AgB10, phycoerythrin-conjugated mAb A85-1, and allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-TCR \u2424-chain. iNKT cells were gated as \u2423-GC loaded CD1 days dimmer and TCR\u2424 double-positive cells, and T cells were gated as TCR\u2424 single-positive cells. Stained cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur with CellQuest Software (Becton Dickinson, CA).\n\nIn Vivo Injection of \u2423-GC B6 mice were treated intraperitoneally with either 500 g of AgB10 or 500 g of control rat IgG antibody. Four days after the treatment, 250 l of blood was collected at 2 or 6 hours after intravenous injection with 0.6 g \u2423-GC/ dimethyl sulfoxide or control dimethyl sulfoxide. Blood samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C, and serum was collected and IFN-\u2425 and IL-4 were determined using ELISA kit (BD Bioscience, CA).\n\nEAE clinical scores for groups of mice are presented as the mean group clinical score \u03ee SEM, and statistical differences were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U nonparametric ranking test. Data for cytokines were analyzed with the two-way analysis of variance. In appropriate cases, post hoc comparisons were made.\n\nTo assess the role of CEACAM1 on EAE, we first examined the effect of CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein encoding the extracellular portion of the mCEACAM1-4L. CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein has been demonstrated to homophilically ligate the CEACAM1 molecule, which has been shown to inhibit IFN-\u2425 production. 12 As shown in Figure 1A , administration of CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein significantly inhibited the development and the progression of EAE compared with control mice.\n\nTo characterize the immunosuppressive effect of CEACAM1, we performed the pathological analysis of CNS inflammation and demyelination in EAE-induced mice treated with CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein ( Figure  1B ). Histological examination of the spinal cord 16 days after EAE induction revealed less cellular infiltration and demyelination in CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein-treated mice, as compared with control mice.\n\nWe next examined the effects of CEACAM1 specific antibody, AgB10, on the development and progression of MOG 35-55 -induced EAE in B6 mice ( Figure 1C) . Ligation of CEACAM1, either homophilically by CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein or heterophilically by microbial components such as the spike glycoprotein of murine hepatitis virus, has been demonstrated to inhibit the proliferation and cytokine production of T cells. 6 -12 In contrast, AgB10 has been reported to enhance the T cell proliferation, indicating that AgB10 acts as a blocking antibody. As expected, the clinical scores of EAE were augmented in the mice treated with AgB10 compared with those of control mice. These results indicate that signals through CEACAM1 suppressed both the clinical and the pathological severity of EAE.\n\nSince MOG induced EAE is thought to be mediated by MOG 35-55 -specific Th1 and Th17 cells, we next examined MOG 35-55 -specific T cell responses in CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein-treated (Figure 2A) , or AgB10-treated mice ( Figure 2B ). We immunized mice with MOG 35-55 and treated them with either AgB10 or CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein. Twelve days later, we harvested LN cells and restimulated them with MOG peptide in vitro to examine cytokine production and proliferation. Compared with cells from the control mice, LN cells obtained from CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein treated mice were significantly inhibited in IFN-\u2425 and IL-17 production in responses to MOG 35-55 restimulation ( Figure 2A ). IL-4 was not detected in the supernatant. On the other hand, in vivo treatment with AgB10 showed an enhancement of IFN-\u2425 and IL-17 production in response to MOG 35-55 stimulation ( Figure 2B ). Proliferative responses were not significantly different between control mice, CEACAM1-Fc protein-treated, or AgB10-treated mice (data not shown).\n\nThese results indicate that the suppressive effect of CEACAM1 on EAE was associated with reduction of MOG 35-55 -specific IFN-\u2425 and IL-17 production.\n\nIt has been reported that CEACAM1 is expressed on T cells early after activation, and its ligation directly inhibits IFN-\u2425 production by such T cells. We therefore examined the time course of CEACAM1 expression by T cells in vitro. As reported previously, CEACAM1 expression was observed on T cells several hours after activation with ConA and anti-CD3 mAb in vitro. Moreover, we observed that there was a rapid and higher expression of CEACAM1 by CD1-restricted iNKT cells after activation ( Figure 3A ). The log fluorescence intensity of CEACAM1 on surface of iNKT and T cells and the percentage of CEACAM1 expressed cells within total iNKT or T cells showed a rapid and also enhanced expression of CEACAM1 on iNKT cells compared with T cells after activation ( Figure 3B ).\n\niNKT cells possess the ability to produce a wide variety of cytokines. Activation of iNKT cells is known to lead to either suppressive or stimulatory immune responses depending on the type of cytokine they produce. 30 We have demonstrated the rapid and enhanced expression of CEACAM1 specifically on iNKT cells ( Figure 3A ). Thus we next examined whether or not the administration of AgB10 has an effect on cytokine production by iNKT cells. Mice were injected intravenously with iNKT cellspecific ligand, \u2423-GC, or vehicle, and serum levels of IFN-\u2425 and IL-4 were measured. Mice pretreated with AgB10 and injected with \u2423-GC showed significantly increased level of IFN-\u2425, as compared with mice treated with control antibody and injected with \u2423-GC ( Figure 4A ). No significant difference was observed in IL-4 production ( Figure 4B ). The level of IL-12 in serum was not altered in AgB10-treated mice, and IL-17, IL-21, or IL-23 were not detected in the serum (data not shown). The results suggest that the signal from CEACAM1 have a role in IFN-\u2425 production by iNKT cells.\n\nSince iNKT cells highly express CEACAM1 after activation, it was of interest to investigate whether the iNKT cells are involved in CEACAM1-mediated amelioration of EAE. To address this question, we examined the effect of CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein on the development of MOG 35-55 -induced EAE in J\u242318 \u03ea/\u03ea mice, which genetically lack iNKT cells. In contrast to B6 mice, no alteration in the severity of EAE was observed in CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein treated J\u242318 \u03ea/\u03ea mice, as compared with control mice ( Figure 5A ). To further determine the effect of the ligation of CEACAM1 on EAE in J\u242318 \u03ea/\u03ea mice, we analyzed the CNS inflammation and demyelination in EAE-induced J\u242318 \u03ea/\u03ea mice treated with CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein. In contrast to wild-type B6 mice, histological examination of the spinal cord of J\u242318 \u03ea/\u03ea mice showed cellular infiltration and demyelination to a similar extent as sham-treated mice ( Figure 5B ). We next induced EAE in J\u242318 \u03ea/\u03ea mice treated with either AgB10 or control antibody. Again, no suppression of clinical EAE was observed in AgB10-treated J\u242318 \u03ea/\u03ea mice, as compared with the control mice ( Figure 5C ).\n\nThese data show that CEACAM1 signal modulation does not affect on the severity of clinical and pathological EAE in mice lacking iNKT cells.\n\nThe suppression of EAE by the ligation of CECAM1 in B6 mice was associated with a reduction in MOG 35-55 -specific IFN-\u2425 and IL-17 production. We next examined MOG 35-55 -specific T cell responses in CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein-treated ( Figure 6A ), or AgB10-treated J\u242318 \u03ea/\u03ea mice ( Figure 6B ) by ex vivo re-challenge with MOG 35-55 on day 11 after the immunization of MOG . In contrast to B6 mice, LN cells from CEACAM1-Fc fusion protein-treated J\u242318 \u03ea/\u03ea mice exhibited no significant reduction of MOG 35-55 specific IFN-\u2425 and IL-17 production compared with the control mice ( Figure 6A ). Additionally, in vivo treatment of J\u242318 \u03ea/\u03ea mice with AgB10 also did not significantly enhance of MOG 35-55 -specific T cell IFN-\u2425 and IL-17 production ( Figure 6B ). These results indicate that iNKT cells play an important role in CEACAM1-mediated reduction of MOG-specific IFN-\u2425 and IL-17 production.\n\nThe present study demonstrated that the signal through CEACAM1 suppressed EAE in association with a reduction in MOG 35-55 -specific production of IFN-\u2425 and IL-17. Moreover, we showed that CEACAM1 was expressed at an early time point by iNKT cells after activation and CEACAM1 also affected the cytokine production by iNKT cells, including IFN-\u2425, but not IL-4. Finally, we demonstrated that CEACAM1-mediated modulation of EAE and MOG 35-55 -specific cytokine production required iNKT cells.\n\nSince both IFN-\u2425 and IL-17 are known as potent inducers of EAE, 21,27-29 CEACAM1-mediated reduction of these cytokines is thought to have a significant role in ameliorating EAE. Although the mechanisms of IFN-\u2425 and IL-17 reduction in CEACAM1-mediated suppression of EAE are not clearly defined so far, we found that the effects of AgB10 and CEACAM1-Fc fusion proteins on EAE and MOG 35-55 -reactive cytokine responses were abolished in iNKT cell-deficient J\u242318 \u03ea/\u03ea mice. Thus we concluded that CEACAM1-mediated suppression of EAE was mediated via iNKT cells. Activation of iNKT cells are known to modulate dendritic cell functions, and Kammerer et al reported that AgB10 triggered release of IL-12 from dendritic cells and facilitated priming of naive CD4 \u03e9 T cells with a Th1-like phenotype. 36 In contrast, Iijima et al showed that CEACAM1-mediated inhibition of Th1-mediated colitis was not dependent on the modulation of IL-12, consistent with this finding, IL-12 was not affected in EAE-induced mice by the in vivo treatment of AgB10. Since iNKT cells have been shown to produce IL-21, which promotes the development of Th17 cells, 37 CEACAM1 expression by iNKT cells may have a regulatory role in IL-17 production by Th17 cells via IL-21. However, the production of IL-21 upon iNKT cell activation was not altered by treatment with AgB10. In addition, production of IL-23, which promotes Th17 cell maintenance by activated iNKT cells was not altered in mice treated with AgB10, as compared with control mice. Therefore, the mechanisms how CEACAM1-treated iNKT cells modulate MOG reactive Th1 and Th17 cells remain to be elucidated.\n\nRecently, Mars et al reported that activation of iNKT cells with \u2423-GarCer during priming of the CD4 \u03e9 T cell response prevents the differentiation of na\u00efve CD4 \u03e9 T cells toward the Th17 lineage, and the cytokine neutralization experiments indicated that IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-\u2425 are involved in the iNKT cell-mediated regulation of T cell lineage development. 38 Although the direct mechanisms of iNKT cells in regulating the Th17 compartment are still in question, iNKT cells were shown to have a regulatory role in development of the Th17 lineage. Our laboratory reported that antibiotic treatment alters the composition of gut flora, resulting in amelioration of EAE in a iNKT cell-dependent manner. 39 iNKT cell-dependent amelioration of EAE was associated with the suppression of MOG 35-55 -reactive Th17 cells, although the mechanism by which iNKT cells modulate MOG 35-55 -reactive Th17 cells remained unclear. It was speculated that altering the compositions of gut flora by antibiotic treatment critically influences the function of iNKT cells, which resulted in a reduction of MOG 35-55 -reactive Th17 cells. Since various bacterial and viral pathogens trans-ligate CEACAM1 and suppresses the activation and proliferation of T cells, it is possible that the alteration of cytokine production in physiological or pathological conditions is partly dependent on the way of trans-ligation of pathogens and CEACAM1 on iNKT cells. 3,12,40 -45 In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that CEACAM1 negatively regulates the severity of EAE via an iNKT cell-dependent mechanism. Considering that the selective induction of cytokines by iNKT cells by synthetic ligands has been reported to suppress EAE, 32, 46 CEACAM1 may prove to be a novel target for immunotherapy of multiple sclerosis."}
