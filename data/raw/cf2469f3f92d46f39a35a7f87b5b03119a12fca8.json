{"title": "Design, Synthesis, and Anti-RNA Virus Activity of 6\u2032-Fluorinated- Aristeromycin Analogues", "body": "Over the past 15 years, outbreaks of a number of emerging positive-stranded RNA (+RNA) viruses, 1 such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 2 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), 3 chikungunya virus (CHIKV), 4 and Zika virus (ZIKV) 5 have seriously threatened human health and have had a substantial socioeconomic impact. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause serious respiratory diseases 6 that can be fatal in approximately 10 and 35% of cases, respectively. CHIKV is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes a painful arthritis that can persist for months. 7 ZIKV is also transmitted by mosquitoes, 8 although sexual transmission 8 occurs as well. This virus usually causes mild disease, but can cause neurological complications in adults and fetal death or severe complications, including microcephaly in infants when women are infected during pregnancy. 9 CHIKV and ZIKV have caused massive outbreaks, totaling millions of infections over the past decade. Currently, there are no effective chemotherapeutic agents or vaccines that can prevent or cure infections of any of these four serious pathogens.\n\nThe aforementioned viruses belong to the +RNA virus group (Baltimore class IV), 1 which indicates that their genomic RNA has the same polarity as mRNA and can be directly translated by host ribosomes upon release into the cytoplasm of a host cell. After infection, the genomes of these viruses are translated into polyproteins that are subsequently cleaved into individual proteins by viral and/or host proteases. The nonstructural proteins (nsps) of these viruses harbor a variety of enzymatic activities that are required for the replication of the viral RNA and invariably include a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 10 an enzyme which is not present in uninfected cells. The RdRp transcribes the genomic RNA into a complementary negative-stranded RNA that subsequently serves as the template for the synthesis of new positive-stranded RNA.\n\nMany +RNA viruses (including coronaviruses, CHIKV, and ZIKV) also encode methyltransferases (MTases) 11 that are required for methylations of viral mRNA cap structures. 12 Because this capping is crucial for stability and translation of the viral RNA, and evasion of the host innate immune response, the viral MTases are considered promising targets for the development of antiviral therapy. 12 Inhibition of MTases can be indirectly achieved by the inhibition of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase. 13 The SAH hydrolase catalyzes the interconversion of SAH into adenosine and L-homocysteine. Inhibition of this enzyme leads to the accumulation of SAH in the cell, which in turn inhibits S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)dependent transmethylase reactions by feedback inhibition. 13, 14 Most of the viral MTases are dependent on SAM as the only methyl donor. Compounds that target cellular proteins might exhibit a broader spectrum of activity, are less likely to lead to drug-resistance, but have a higher likelihood of toxicity. Compounds that are specifically aimed at viral proteins are expected to be less cytotoxic, but might have a narrower spectrum of antiviral activity and might have a lower barrier antiviral drug-resistance 14 Thus, the approach of targeting cellular proteins such as SAH hydrolase can be considered as a promising strategy for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents. 14 A number of compounds have been reported to act as SAH hydrolase inhibitors. 14 Type I inhibitors act through inactivation of the NAD + cofactor, and their inhibitory effect on the catalytic activity of the enzyme can be reversed by the addition of excess NAD + . 14 Type II inhibitors are irreversible inhibitors of the SAH hydrolase that form covalent bonds with amino acid residues in the active site of the enzyme. This irreversible inhibition cannot be reversed by the addition of NAD + or adenosine or by dialysis. 14 Because both the viral RdRp and host SAH hydrolase are critical for virus replication, we aimed to design broad-spectrum nucleoside analogue inhibitors that could directly target RdRp activity and/or indirectly inhibit the methylation of viral RNA through their effect on the host SAH hydrolase. Modified nucleosides are usually taken up by the cell via nucleoside transporters and can be successively converted into mono-, di-, and triphosphates by cellular kinases. 15 Then, these modified nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) can compete with natural NTPs during RNA synthesis or can be incorporated into the nascent viral RNA, leading to chain termination or detrimental mutations. 15 (\u2212)-Aristeromycin (1) is a naturally occurring carbocyclic nucleoside that was originally identified as a metabolite of Streptomyces citricolor in 1967. 16a The first synthesis of 1 as racemate was reported by Clayton and his co-worker, 16b\u2212d and its asymmetric syntheses have since been reported. 16e\u2212h It is a type I SAH hydrolase inhibitor and exhibits potent antiviral activity against many viruses. 14a However, it could not be further advanced into clinical development because of its cytotoxicity. 17 Compound 1 was found to be toxic at low concentrations in both adenosine kinase-positive (AK + ) and AK \u2212 cells. AK + cells were presumably killed by the 5\u2032-phosphorylated form of 1, while the toxicity in AK \u2212 cells was caused by 1 itself. 17 However, this compound is also metabolized into a triphosphate form and has been observed to exert a variety of metabolic effects. 17 We aimed to use 1 as a prototype for the design of dual-target compounds intended at directly inhibiting the viral RdRp and indirectly inhibiting the capping process through targeting of cellular SAH hydrolase.\n\nSince the introduction of a fluorine at the 6\u2032-position of carbocyclic nucleosides has been known to affect biological activities to a significant extent, 18 we aimed to synthesize the 6\u2032fluorinated-aristeromycin analogues 2 by introducing fluorine at the 6\u2032-position of 1 (Figure 1 ). Prisbe and his co-workers 18a have reported the synthesis of (\u00b1)-6\u2032-\u03b1-and (\u00b1)-6\u2032-\u03b2-fluorinated aristeromycins and their inhibitory activity on SAH hydrolase, but the synthesis and biological activity of (\u00b1)-6\u2032,6\u2032difluoroaristeromycin was not reported, despite the fact that the structure was claimed in the patent. 18b Thus, we set out to synthesize the 6\u2032-fluorinated-aristeromycin analogues 2 in the optically pure D-forms because biological activity can generally be attributed to one enantiomer, the D-isomer. Yin and coworkers 18c reported the elegant synthesis of optically pure (\u2212)-6\u2032-\u03b2-fluoro-aristeromycin, but its biological activity was not reported. Their synthetic route involved the 6-\u03b2-fluoroazide as the key intermediate, which was synthesized by employing S N 2 fluorination of the 6-\u03b1-triflic azide with tris(dimethylamino)sulfur(trimethylsilyl)difluoride, whereas our current approach 19 included the stereoselective electrophilic fluorination of silyl enol ether with Selectfluor as the fluorine source. In addition to the adenosine analogues, aimed at inhibiting SAH hydrolase and/or RdRp, we have also synthesized 6\u2032-fluorinated purine and pyrimidine nucleosides (changes in B of the structures in Figure 1 ), which could interfere with viral RNA synthesis by targeting the viral RdRp after their phosphorylation by cellular kinases. 15 To bypass the first and rate-limiting 5\u2032-monophosphorylation step, we have also synthesized a phosphoramidate prodrug 3 of nucleoside 2, using the McGuigan ProTides. 20 Herein, we report the synthesis of the 6\u2032-fluoroaristeromycin analogues 2 and 3 and a preliminary characterization of their effect on several +RNA viruses, which provided insight into structure\u2212activity relationships (SARs).\n\nChemistry. For the synthesis of the target nucleosides 2, the key fluorosugars 8a\u2212c were synthesized from D-ribose via electrophilic fluorination, as shown in Scheme 1.\n\nD-Ribose was converted to D-cyclopentenone 4 according to our previously published procedure. 21 The 1,4-conjugated addition of 4 with Gilman reagent yielded the D-cyclopentanone derivative 5. 19, 22 Treatment of 5 with lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS) followed by trapping with triethylsilyl chloride (TESCl) gave silylenol ether 6, which was treated with (1-chloromethyl-4-fluoro-1,4-diazoniabicyclo[2.2.2] octane bis(tetrafluoroborate): Selectfluor) in dimethylformamide (DMF) at 0\u00b0C to yield a 5:1 ratio of 6-\u03b2-fluorosugar 7a to \n\nArticle 6-\u03b1-fluorosugar 7b. 19 The stereochemistry of the fluorine in 7a and 7b was confirmed by 1 H NOE experiments. Irradiation of 6-H of 7b gave NOE effects on its 2-H and 5-H, indicating the 6-\u03b1fluoro configuration, but no NOE effects were observed on the same experiment in the case of 7a, confirming the 6-\u03b2-fluoro configuration. The configuration of the fluorine in 7b was further confirmed by the X-ray crystal structure obtained after it was converted to the final uracil derivative 2g (Scheme 5). Further electrophilic fluorination of 6-\u03b2-fluorosugar 7a or 6-\u03b1fluorosugar 7b under the same conditions yielded the 6,6difluorosugar 7c, which was equilibrated to form a geminal diol because of the presence of electronegative fluorine atoms. Electrophilic fluorinations with other electrophilic fluorines such as N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide (NFSI) or N-fluoro-Obenzenedisulfonimide (NFOBS) were problematic, resulting in low yields with many side spots. The reduction of 7a\u2212c with sodium borohydride (NaBH 4 ) or lithium borohydride (LiBH 4 ) in MeOH resulted in the production of the 1-hydroxyl derivatives 8a\u2212c.\n\nAs the \u03b1-fluoro derivative 8b was obtained as the minor isomer, as shown in Scheme 1, we wanted to improve the stereoselective synthesis of 8b, by using Rubottom 23 oxidation as the key step, as illustrated in Scheme 2. Rubottom oxidation of silylenol ether 6 with osmium tetroxide (OsO 4 ) and Nmethylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMO) followed by trapping with t-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBSCl) produced 6-\u03b2-alkoxyketone 9 as a single stereoisomer in 53% yield. The reduction of ketone 9 with NaBH 4 gave alcohol 10, which was protected with a benzyl group to give 11. Removal of the t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBS) group in 11 with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) yielded the 6-\u03b2-alcohol 12. To our disappointment, the treatment of 12 with N,N-diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST) gave the desired product, 6-\u03b1-fluoride 13a, but also the undesired product 1-\u03b2-fluoride 13b at a 1:1 ratio. The formation of 13a (route I) resulted from the direct S N 2 reaction of 12a with fluoride, while 12a was readily converted into the oxonium ion 12b (route II) via its participation of the neighboring benzyl group, which was attacked exclusively by the fluoride at the less sterically hindered 1-position to yield the undesired product 13b (route III). However, the product via route IV was not formed because of the steric effect of the t-butyloxymethyl substituent.\n\nTo avoid the participation of the neighboring group, we considered using a cyclic sulfate substrate with electronwithdrawing property and conformational restraint to be the best choice. Furthermore, cyclic sulfate has the advantage that it can be utilized as a surrogate for epoxide during nucleobase condensation, as shown in Scheme 3. The regioselective cleavage of the 2,3-acetonide in 10 with trimethylaluminum (AlMe 3 ) followed by treatment of the resulting diol with thionyl chloride (SOCl 2 ) yielded the 6-\u03b2-hydroxyl cyclic sulfite 14 after Scheme 1. Synthesis of 6-\u03b2-Fluoro-, 6-\u03b1-Fluoro-, and 6-Difluorosugar 8a\u2212c a a Reagents and conditions: (a) LiCu(CH 2 Ot-Bu) 2 ; (b) \n\nArticle the removal of the TBS group. The treatment of 14 with DAST yielded the desired 6-\u03b1-fluoro cyclic sulfite 15 as a single stereoisomer. The cyclic sulfite 15 was oxidized to form cyclic sulfate 16, which was subsequently condensed with 6chloropurine anions; however, this resulted in decomposition. 19 Thus, we decided to synthesize the 6-\u03b1-fluoro derivative 8b according to Scheme 1.\n\nScheme 4 depicts the synthesis of the aristeromycin analogues 2a\u2212e from the 6-\u03b2-fluoro-, 6-\u03b1-fluoro-, and 6,6-difluorosugars 8a\u2212c. 19 Compounds 8a\u2212c were treated with triflic anhydride (Tf 2 O) followed by treatment with sodium azide to give azido derivatives 18a\u2212c. The catalytic hydrogenation of 18a\u2212c yielded the amino derivatives 19a\u2212c, respectively, which are starting compounds for the base-building process. The treatment of 19a\u2212c with 5-amino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine 18a\u2212c,24 in the presence of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) under microwave radiation conditions yielded 20a\u2212c, which were cyclized with diethoxymethyl acetate 18a\u2212c,24 in the presence of microwave radiation to produce the 6-chloropurine derivatives 21a\u2212c. The treatment of 21a\u2212c with t-butanolic ammonia followed by the removal of protective groups under acidic conditions yielded the 6\u2032-\u03b2-fluoro-, 6\u2032-\u03b1-fluoro-, and 6\u2032,6\u2032difluoroaristeromycins 2a\u2212c, respectively. The structure of compound 2c was confirmed by a single-crystal X-ray analysis (see the Supporting Information). 25 The treatment of 21a and 21c with 40% aqueous methylamine followed by aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) resulted in N 6 -methyl-aristeromycin analogues 2d and 2e, respectively.\n\nThe amino derivatives 19a\u2212c were also converted into the pyrimidine nucleoside derivatives 2f\u2212j, as shown in Scheme 5. Treatment of 19a\u2212c with (E)-3-methoxy-2-propenoyl isocyanate, which was prepared by reacting 3-methoxyacryloyl chloride with silver cyanate, 26 in benzene produced 22a\u2212c, respectively, which were cyclized with 2 M H 2 SO 4 to yield the uridine derivatives 2f\u2212h, respectively. The structures of 2g and 2h were confirmed by the X-ray crystallography (see the Supporting Information) (Scheme 5). 27 To synthesize the cytidine derivatives 2i and 2j, compounds 2f and 2h were benzoylated to give 23a and 23b, respectively, which were \n\nArticle converted to the cytidine derivatives 2i and 2j using conventional three-step procedures. 28 The uracil phosphoramidate analogue Sofosbuvir 20 is used in the clinic as a powerful anti-hepatitis C virus agent. Therefore, we have also synthesized the uracil phosphoramidate prodrugs 3b\u2212c and the adenine phosphoramidate prodrug 3a derived from the purine and pyrimidine nucleoside analogues 2a\u2212j by using McGuigan's ProTide prodrug methodology, 20 as shown in Scheme 6. 6\u2032,6\u2032-Difluoro-aristeromycin (2c) was treated with acetone under acidic conditions to give 2,3-acetonide 24. The treatment of 24 with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (Boc 2 O) yielded a mixture of 25a and 25b in a 2:1 ratio, which was converted to the phosphoramidate prodrug 26 by treating with phosphoramiditing reagent (A) 29 in the presence of t-butylmagnesium chloride. The treatment of 26 with 50% formic acid produced the final product, prodrug 3a. The monofluoro-and difluoropyrimidine derivatives 2f and 2h were similarly converted to the final prodrugs 3b and 3c.\n\nInhibition of SAH Hydrolase. All compounds 1, 2a\u2212j, and 3a\u2212c were assayed for their ability to inhibit recombinant human SAH hydrolase protein, expressed in Escherichia coli JM109, using a 5,5\u2032-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoate (DTNB) coupled assay as described by Lozada-Rami\u0301rez et al. 30 As expected, all adenosine derivatives 2a\u2212e potently inhibited SAH hydrolase, but none of the pyrimidine analogues 2f\u2212j showed any inhibitory activity at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM. None of the prodrugs 3a\u2212c exhibited inhibitory activity at concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM. This result is not surprising because adenosine is the substrate for SAH hydrolase. Among the adenosine analogues, 6\u2032-\u03b2-fluoroaristeromycin (2a) exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 0.37 \u03bcM), which was 3.6-fold more potent than the control 1 (IC 50 = 1.32 \u03bcM). However, 6\u2032-\u03b1-fluoroaristeromycin (2b, IC 50 = 9.70 \u03bcM) was 26-fold less potent than the corresponding 6\u2032-\u03b2-fluoro analogue 2a and 7.4-fold less active than the 6\u2032-unsubstituted compound 1. This indicates that the stereochemistry at the 6\u2032-position is important for inhibitory activity. Interestingly, the introduction of two fluorines at the 6\u2032-position resulted in 2c (IC 50 = 1.06 \u03bcM), which was slightly more potent than the control 1. The inhibitory activity of the 6\u2032-fluoro-aristeromycin series can be ranked in the following order: 6\u2032-\u03b2-F > 6\u2032,6\u2032-F,F > 6\u2032-H > 6\u2032-\u03b1-F. The introduction of a methyl group at the N 6 -amino group of 2a, resulting in 2d, decreased the inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 4.39 \u03bcM) by 11.9-fold, while the addition of a methyl group to the N 6 -amino group of 2c, resulting in 2e, increased the inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 0.76 \u03bcM) by 1.7-fold. These results demonstrate that the N 6 -methyladenine and the adenine moieties do not lead to a decrease in inhibitory activity. Antiviral Activity. The novel 6\u2032-fluoro-aristeromycin analogues 2a\u2212j and 3a\u2212c were screened for antiviral activity \n\nArticle against a variety of +RNA viruses. The compounds were tested for antiviral activity in cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assays at 4 concentrations, that is, 150, 50, 16.7, and 5.6 \u03bcM by preparing 3-fold serial dilutions. Compounds that demonstrated antiviral activity in this primary screen were further tested more extensively in dose response experiments at 8 different concentrations to determine the EC 50 . Cytotoxicity (CC 50 ) was determined in parallel in uninfected cells ( Table 1) . As shown in Table 1 , only the adenosine derivatives 2a\u2212c exhibited potent antiviral activities against +RNA viruses, while the other purine N 6 -methyladenine derivatives 2d and 2e and pyrimidine derivatives 2f\u2212j did not show significant antiviral activities, not even at 100 \u03bcM. This result suggests that the antiviral activity might be due to an (indirect) effect on viral MTase activity through the inhibition of host SAH hydrolase. Inhibition of the viral RdRp appears not to be important. The mechanism of action of these compounds has been studied in more detail and results will be published elsewhere.\n\nCompound 2a inhibited MERS-CoV replication with an EC 50 of 0.20 \u03bcM; however, it was also rather cytotoxic, resulting in a selectivity index (SI) of 3. Replacement of the remaining 6\u2032-H in 2a with F resulted in compound 2c, which exhibited a > 5-fold \n\na ND: not determined; SI = CC 50 /EC 50 . b EC 50 : effective concentration to inhibit the replication of the virus by 50%. c CC 50 : cytotoxic concentration to inhibit the replication of normal cells by 50%. d EC 50 > 100 indicates that no antiviral activity was observed at the highest concentration tested because either there was no protection or the compound was toxic. Figure 2 . Effect of 2c on the infectious progeny of CHIKV, ZIKV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Cells were infected with the virus indicated on the yaxis of the graph in medium with various concentrations of 2c. Infectious progeny titers were determined by plaque assay (n = 4) and viability of noninfected cells was monitored using the CellTiter 96AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega). Significant differences are indicated by *: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001; ****, p < 0.0001. reduction in cytotoxicity, while its antiviral activity remained unchanged, with an EC 50 of \u223c0.20 \u03bcM and an SI of 15 for MERS-CoV. This compound was also active against SARS-CoV with an SI of 12.5, suggesting that it may be a broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitor. In addition, it also inhibited ZIKV replication with an EC 50 of 0.26 \u03bcM (SI > 10) and was active against CHIKV with an EC 50 of 0.13 \u03bcM. Compound 2b showed some inhibitory effects on CHIKV and ZIKV replication, but this was likely due to pleiotropic cytotoxic effects, as the SI was <3. Among the phosphoramidate prodrugs 3a\u2212c, only the adenosine prodrug 3a exhibited significant broad-spectrum antiviral activities, demonstrating that it may inhibit the RdRp of RNA viruses after conversion into the triphosphate form, although it remains to be determined in biochemical assays whether the triphosphate form affects RdRp activity. 20 Compound 3a had an EC 50 of 9.3 \u03bcM for MERS-CoV and 6.8 \u03bcM for SARS-CoV, but it also had an SI < 10, and it was therefore not considered a potent inhibitor of coronavirus replication. However, for CHIKV and ZIKV, 3a had EC 50 values of 1.95 and 1.75 \u03bcM, respectively, with good selectivity indices. Interestingly, the prodrug 3a was less potent, but also much less cytotoxic than the parent compound 2c, which is unusual as regularly the phosphoramidate is more potent than the parent drug. 20 The phosphoramidate 3a might be slowly hydrolyzed to the 5\u2032-monophosphate by metabolic enzymes, or to the parent drug 2c by a phosphatase, which could inhibit SAH hydrolase, explaining the observed antiviral effect. Viral load reduction assays were performed with compound 2c by infecting cells with CHIKV, ZIKV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, followed by treatment with different concentrations of 2c. At 30 hpi (CHIKV) or 48 hpi (ZIKV, SARS-and MERS-CoV), infectious progeny titers in the medium were determined by plaque assay ( Figure 2 ). Treatment with concentrations higher than 1 \u03bcM of 2c reduced infectious CHIKV titers by more than 2 log. The effect on ZIKV infectious progeny titers was limited and showed a \u223c1 log reduction. For SARS-CoV, the reduction in infectious progeny titer was \u223c1.5 log at 2c concentrations above 0.3 \u03bcM. The strongest antiviral effect was observed for MERS-CoV, with a \u223c2.5 log reduction in infectious progeny titers when infected cells were treated with 2c concentrations above 0.3 \u03bcM. Followup studies to gain more insights into the mode of action of 2c and 3a and related compounds are currently ongoing, and results will be published elsewhere.\n\nFinally, we measured the log P of the most active compound 2c by the pH-metric method, using a T3 Sirius instrument, because the lipophilicity is a major determinant for compound absorption, distribution in the body, penetration across biological barriers, metabolism, and excretion. The measured log P was 0.02, indicating that it is almost equally partitioned between the lipid and aqueous phases. The relatively low log P of 2c is expected to be overcome by converting it to the phosphoramidate 3a.\n\nWe have synthesized the 6\u2032-fluorinated aristeromycin analogues 2a\u2212j, which were designed as dual-target antiviral compounds aimed at inhibiting both the viral RdRp and the host SAH hydrolase. The electrophilic fluorination of silyl enol ether with Selectfluor was the key step in the synthesis. We have also synthesized the phosphoramidate prodrugs 3a\u2212c to determine whether these would inhibit virus replication through an effect on the viral RNA polymerase. Figure 3 depicts the summarized SAR of the synthesized 6\u2032-fluorinated final nucleoside analogues 2a\u2212j and 3a\u2212c concerning the inhibition of human SAH hydrolase and the inhibition of the replication of various +RNA viruses with capped genomes. It was discovered that the introduction of fluorine at the 6\u2032-position increases the inhibitory activity on SAH hydrolase and the replication of selected +RNA viruses. Compared to the 6\u2032-unsubstituted compound 1, the 6\u2032-fluorinated aristeromycin analogues 2a and 2c more potently inhibited SAH hydrolase activity and the replication of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, ZIKV, and CHIKV. Among these compounds, 6\u2032-\u03b2-fluoroaristeromycin (2a) was the most potent with an IC 50 of 0.37 \u03bcM for SAH hydrolase activity and an EC 50 of 0.20 \u03bcM for MERS-CoV replication. There was a correlation between the inhibition of SAH hydrolase and the antiviral activity of the compounds, suggesting that the latter was mainly due to indirect targeting of viral methylation reactions. The SAR studies and a lack of antiviral effects of several purine and pyrimidine analogues suggest that the antiviral effect of 1, 2a, and 2c is unlikely due to targeting of the viral RdRp. Compound 2c appears to be an interesting compound for further development and evaluation as a broadspectrum antiviral agent, as it inhibited several coronaviruses, CHIKV, and ZIKV. More detailed biological studies on the efficacy of these compounds in virus-infected cells and into their mode of action are currently ongoing and will be published elsewhere.\n\nChemical Synthesis. General Methods. Proton ( 1 H) and carbon ( 13 C) NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker AV 400 (400/100 MHz), Bruker AMX 500 (500/125 MHz), JEOL JNM-ECA600 (600/ 150 MHz), or Bruker AVANCE III 800 (800/200 MHz) spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported as parts per million (\u03b4) relative to the solvent peak. Coupling constants (J) are reported in hertz. Mass spectra were recorded on a Thermo LCQ XP instrument. Optical rotations were determined on Jasco III in appropriate solvent. UV spectra were recorded on U-3000 made by Hitachi in methanol or water. Infrared spectra were recorded on FT-IR (FTS-135) made by Bio-Rad. Melting points were determined on a Buchan B-540 instrument and are uncorrected. The crude compounds were purified by column chromatography on a silica gel (Kieselgel 60, 70\u2212230 mesh, Merck). Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were used to determine the purity of all synthesized compounds, and the results were within \u00b10.4% of the calculated values, confirming \u226595% purity. [1, 3] dioxol-4-yl)oxy)triethylsilane (6). To a cooled (\u221278\u00b0C) solution of 5 (1568.0 mg, 6.470 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF; 32.0 mL, 0.2 M) was dropwise added chlorotriethylsilane (5.4 mL, 32.355 mmol) , followed by addition of LiHMDS (19.0 mL, 1.0 M solution in THF, 19.0 mmol) under N 2 . After being stirred at the same temperature for 10 min, the reaction mixture was quenched with saturated aqueous NH 4 Cl (80 mL). The layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc; 150 mL). The combined organic layers were washed successively with H 2 O and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO 4 , filtered, and evaporated. The residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, hexanes/EtOAc, 100/1 to 30/1) to give 6 (2267.0 mg, 98%) as colorless oil: 1, 110.3, 104.4, 82.8, 79.7, 72.5, 63.9, 47.9, 27.4 (3 \u00d7 CH 3 -tert-butyl), 27.3, 25.8, 6.5 \n\nTo a cooled (0\u00b0C) solution of silyl enol ether 6 (8.75 g, 24.548 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (123.0 mL, 0.20 M) was added 1-chloromethyl-4-fl uoro-1,4diazoniabicyclo [2.2.2] octane bis(tetrafluoroborate) (13.04 g, 36.824 mmol, Selectfluor) in one portion under N 2 . After being stirred at the same temperature for 12 h, the reaction mixture was quenched with saturated aqueous NH 4 Cl (130 mL), diluted with EtOAc (130 mL). The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (2 \u00d7 100 mL).

The absorbance was measured at 495 nm in a Berthold Mithras LB 940 plate reader, and the values were expressed relative to uninfected (infection) or untreated (viability) samples. The results represent the average of quadruplicate samples expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD. Compounds that were found to be protective were further evaluated in CPE reduction assays by testing 8 different concentrations to determine the EC 50 as previously described. 31, 34 The cytotoxicity (CC 50 ) of the compounds was determined in parallel, and all experiments were performed in quadruplicate. Graph-Pad Prism 8.0.1 was used for EC 50 and CC 50 determination by nonlinear regression. Viral Load Reduction Assays. VeroE6 (CHIKV, ZIKV) cells were seeded at a density of 7.5 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well in 0.5 mL DMEM/8%FCS in 24-well cell culture plates and allowed to adhere overnight. For MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, a cell density of or 6.0 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well of Vero E6 and Vero cells was used, respectively, under the same conditions as described above. The next day, compound dilutions (0\u22121.5 \u03bcM) were prepared in EMEM/2%FCS to which virus was added to yield inocula for infecting the cells with an MOI of 0.1 for CHIKV, MOI of 1 for ZIKV, and MOI of 0.01 for SARS-and MERS-CoV. Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 250 \u03bcL/well of the inoculum for 1 h (CHIKV and SARS-and MERS-CoV) or 2 h (ZIKV). After the infection, the cells were washed twice with 1 mL/well warm phosphate-buffered saline and 0.5 mL/well fresh EMEM/2%FCS with different concentrations of compound 2c (0\u22121.5 \u03bcM) was added. The cells were incubated for 30 h (CHIKV) or 48 h (ZIKV, SARS-and MERS-CoV) at 37\u00b0C, after which supernatants were harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for determination of the infectious virus titer by plaque assay. Viability assays were conducted in parallel as described in the previous paragraph. Plaque assays with CHIKV and SARS-CoV on VeroE6 cells, MERS-CoV on Vero cells, and ZIKV on Vero CCL81 cells were performed as described previously. 31,34a,35 Compound 2c was tested at each concentration in duplicate in two independent experiments (n = 4).
