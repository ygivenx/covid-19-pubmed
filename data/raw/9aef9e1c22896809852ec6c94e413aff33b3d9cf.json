{"title": "Inactivating porcine coronavirus before nuclei acid isolation with the temperature higher than 56 o C damages its genome integrity seriously", "body": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is the pathogen of Corona Virus Disease 2019 [1] . Nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV is one of the key indicators for clinical diagnosis. However, the false negative rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in clinical practice is very high, and the positive rate is only 30-50% [2] . False negative detection means missed detection, which will lead to not only the delayed diagnosis of suspected patients, but also the 2019-nCoV carriers becoming the potential sources of virus infection. Therefore, it is very urgent to improve the detection rate of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid clinically.\n\nCurrently, fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) technology is mainly used to detect the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV. The quality of nucleic acid template is admittedly one of the key factors affecting the detection efficiency. According to \"The Laboratory Technical Guidelines for Detection 2019-nCoV (Fourth Edition)\" issued by National Health and Commission of China [3] and \"The Experts' Consensus on Nucleic Acid Detection of 2019-nCoV\" released by Chinese Society of Laboratory Medicine [4] , the human samples must be placed in 56 o C for at least 45 minutes or higher for shorter time to inactivate the viruses in order to keep the inspectors from virus infection before the nucleic acids were isolated.\n\nHowever, 2019-nCoV is a single stranded RNA virus. Theoretically, the progress of killing the viruses with high temperature will damage the integrity of their RNA genomes in the samples, thus improperly reducing the amount of target viral templates, and eventually leading to high false negative rate of the virus detection. In this study, we employed porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a kind of coronavirus, as a model virus to test the above hypothesis and our results demonstrated that the virus inactivation progress by high temperature damaged the detectable template of the coronavirus seriously. Biological. Company, Ltd.) or 1 ng \u03bbDNA (3010, Takara, Japan) were suspended and mixed together using 1.5 mL of sample preservation medium (R503, Vamzye, China) or 1.5 mL Hank's solution.\n\nNucleic acid (DNA/RNA) was extracted using a commercial kit (RC311-C1, Vazyme) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 500 \u00b5L samples preserved in R503 was first added into a 1.5 ml EP tube containing 200 \u00b5L of absolute ethanol and 200 \u00b5L samples preserved in Hank's solution was added into a 1.5 ml EP tube containing 500 \u00b5L lysis buffer.\n\nThe mixture was vortexed thoroughly and then transferred into a column placed onto a 2 mL EP collection tube. After centrifuge for 1 min at 12,000\u00d7g, the column was placed onto a fresh 2 mL EP collection tube, followed by adding 600 \u00b5L washing buffer and then centrifuge for 30 sec at 12,000\u00d7g. Washing step was repeated once. The column was placed onto a new 2 mL collection. After centrifuge for 2 min at 12,000\u00d7g, the column was then placed onto a 1.5 ml collection tube. 100 \u00b5L and 40 \u00b5L elution buffer was added into the center of the membrane of column collected the sample prepared by R503 and Hank's solution respectively and then centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 \u00d7 g to collect the nucleic acid. The nucleic acid was stored at -30 ~ -15 o C for usage within short time and at -70 o C for long storage 2.3 Agarose gel electrophoresis 5 \u00b5L of the extracted nucleic acids, 1 \u00b5L of 10 \u00d7 DNA loading buffer (P022, Vazyme) and 4 \u00b5L of nuclease-free H 2 O were mixed and then vortexed briefly. The mixture was heated in PCR instrument to denature the nucleic acid for 2 min and then subjected to 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis separation on ice for 7-10 min together with the standard DNA marker (MD103, Vazyme).\n\nauthor/funder.

The reaction (25 \u00b5L) was assembled as follows: 12.5 \u00b5L of 2 \u00d7 One Step U+ Mix, 1.25 \u00b5L of One Step U+ Enzyme Mix, 0.5 \u00b5L of 50 \u00d7 ROX Reference Dye 1, 0.5 \u00b5L of Gene Specific Primer Forward (10 \u00b5M), 0.5 \u00b5L of Gene Specific Primer Reverse (10 \u00b5M), 0.25 \u00b5L of TaqMan Probe (10 \u00b5M), and 4.5 \u00b5L nuclease free H2O.\n\nThe reaction was carried out on ABI StepOnePlusTM using following conditions: \n\nStatistical significance was determined using the paired two-tailed t test.

Three groups were incubated at 56 o C for 30, 45 and 60 minutes, respectively. The fourth was incubated at 92 o C for 5 minutes, and the fifth group was stored at 4 o C as no inactivation control. After the high-temperature inactivation was completed, nucleic acids (including DNA and RNA) were extracted by conventional methods, and subjected to run 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis. \n\nTo understand the effect of the virus inactivation progress with the temperature higher than 56 o C on the integrity of viral nucleic acid, we quantitated the amount of Table S1 ). The results suggest that only 50.11% of the detectable viral templates left after the inactivation progress of incubation at 56 o C for 30 minutes and only 3.36% of the detectable viral templates left after the inactivation progress of incubation at 92 o C for 5 minutes.\n\nTo investigate whether any solutions are able to protect viral RNA integrity from author/funder.

We then performed the same viral inactivation experiments as using Hank's solution.\n\nCompared with the control group that the sample was stored at 4 o C, both DNA and RNA in the samples incubated at 56 o C for 30 -60 minutes also displayed obvious degradation, among which the 28 S and 18 S bands of total RNA of human cells were obviously smeared, and the large bands of genomic DNA became weaker while there were almost no visible genomic DNA and 28 S RNA bands in the sample incubated at 92 o C for 5 minutes (Fig 1D) . However, the degradation of nucleic acid during the inactivation progress was not as serious as that of the samples prepared by Hank's solution. The results suggest that R503 should have a significant protective effect of both total RNA and genomic DNA from degradation.\n\nTo determine the effect of the inactivation progress with temperature higher than 56 o C on the integrity of viral nucleic acid in the samples prepared with R503, we examined the amount of porcine PEDV coronavirus by qRT-PCR as above.\n\nCompared with the CT (31.64 \u00b1 0.10) of the control group that the sample was stored at 4 o C, the mean value of CT (31.31 \u00b1 0.17) of the group incubated at 56 o C for 30 minutes had no significant change. The difference of CTs between the two groups was less than 0.5 ( Fig. 1E ; Figure S1B ; Table S1 ). Moreover, the mean value of CT (31.43 \u00b1 0.08) in the group incubated at 92 o C for 5 minutes was also not changed significantly. The difference of CTs between the two groups was less than 0.5 either (Fig. 1F; Fig. S1B ; Table S1 ). These results showed that the inactivation progress with the temperature higher than 56 o C did not significantly affect the detectable template of viral nucleic acid when it was prepared with R503, suggesting that the fragmented viral RNA could still be good for using as a template for qRT-PCR even if the viral nucleic acid was degraded.\n\nIn order to understand the advantage of R503 over common isotonic solution in author/funder.

The results showed that the detectable amount of the viral RNA in the two prepared solutions was similar (Fig. 1G, Table S1 ), and the difference between the mean values of their CT was less than 0.5 (31.64 \u00b1 0.10 vs 31.95 \u00b1 0.10). The results suggest that there is no significant difference in the amount of detectable viral RNA templates between the samples prepared by either R503 or Hank's solutions that were stored at Table S1 ). The results suggest that the detectable templates of viruses in the samples prepared by Hank's solution was only 32.30% of R503 solution after the samples were inactivated at 56 o C for 30 minutes to kill the virus. Furthermore, after inactivation at 92 o C for 5 minutes, the CT of detected PEDV virus in the two preservation solutions were 31.43 \u00b1 0.08 (R503) and 36.84 \u00b1 0.37 (Hank's), respectively. The mean value of CT of detected virus in the samples prepared by Hank's solution was 5.4125 higher than that prepared by R503 (P < 0.0001; Figure 1I , Table S1 ). The results reveal the detectable amount of virus in the samples prepared by Hank's solution was only 2.35% of R503 solution after the samples were inactivated at 92 o C for 5 minutes to kill the virus.\n\nIn addition to the disruptive effect of the virus inactivation with high temperature on the detection of RNA virus, the detectable amount of the viral DNA (\u03bb phage) in the samples was also significantly affected. qPCR results (Fig. S1C, Table S1) showed that mean value of CT (23.55 \u00b1 0.20) of detectable virus in the samples author/funder.

The mean value of CT (25.58 \u00b1 0.21) was increased by 2.5572 (P < 0.0001) in the sample incubated at 92 o C for 5 minutes.\n\nFurthermore, we examined the amount of phage DNA in the sample prepared with R503 after high temperature treatment by qPCR. The results (Fig. S1D, Table S1) showed that the mean value of CT (21.71 \u00b1 0.04) in the sample prepared by R503 and incubated at 56 o C for 30 minutes had no significant change compared with that in the control group (21.61 \u00b1 0.06) (the difference between the two was less than 0.5). The mean value of CT (22.90 \u00b1 0.26) was increased by 1.2880 in the sample that was inactivated at 92 o C for 5 minutes, suggesting that 92 o C treatment significantly reduced the detectable amount of DNA viruses in sample even prepared by R503.\n\nIn conclusion, our results show that virus inactivation with temperature higher than 56 o C result in the degradation of viral nucleic acids seriously, which will lead to the artificial shortage of detectable templates of viral nucleic acids in samples, and finally lead to false negative of clinical detection in some samples. Preserved with the optimized solution such as R503, the detectable templates of viral nucleic acids can be kept unchanged after the samples were incubated at 56 o C or higher for killing the viruses although the integrity of cellular nucleic acids were obviously disrupted. The results suggest that if the samples were prepared with an optimal solution, the detectable numbers of viral templates would be unchanged because virus inactivation progress with high temperature does not erase all the RNA but leave small fragments of nucleic acids that are good enough for using as the template for qRT-PCR detection.\n\nIf it is true for 2019-nCoV, preparing the human samples with the optimal solution can not only keep the clinical inspectors from virus infection by inactivating the virus using 56 o C or higher as normal, but also improve the detection sensitivity of viral nucleic acid in the sample, leading to avoiding or at least reducing false negative author/funder.

However, combining the limitations such as only two samples tested and higher amount of virus in the two samples as the authors discussed in their researches, and our experimental evidences that the virus inactivation by high temperature did reduce the detectable amount of the porcine coronavirus template seriously, it is highly recommended to carry out systematic investigation on the impact of high temperature inactivation on the integrity of 2019-nCoV nucleic acids and develop a sample preservation solution to protect the detectable templates of 2019-nCoV nucleic acids from high temperature inactivation damage.
