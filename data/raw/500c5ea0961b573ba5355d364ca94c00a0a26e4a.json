A reduction in about 60% of lipid droplets counting per cell was 179 observed in transfected cells ( Fig 4B) . Yet, neither NS1 secretion nor virus release was affected 180 by Cy40 silencing (Fig 4C and 4D ). This result suggests that while Cy40 participates in 181 cholesterol traffic it may be dispensable for NS1 secretion.

The secretion of YFV NS1 267 was found to be sensitive to BFA treatment in both mosquito and vertebrate cells (Fig. 9A) . In 268 contrast, the secretion of ZIKV NS1 was found to be insensitive to BFA and GCA treatment in 269 infected mosquito, but not in infected vertebrate cells (Fig 9B) . In addition, the secretion of ZIKV 270 NS1 was reduced in mosquito, but not in vertebrate cells, treated with the CyA inhibitor CsA (Fig   271 9C ). Co-localizations experiments carried out in C6/36, Aag2 and Vero-E6 cells infected with 272 ZIKV and YFV, showed a stronger, and a significantly different, co-localization between ZIKV 273 NS1 and CAV-1 than between YFV NS1 and CAV-1, in both mosquito cell lines. No co-274 localization of ZIKV or YFV NS1 with CAV-1 was observed in vertebrate cell line ( Fig 9D and 275 9E). Of note, the co-localization data support the predictions derived from the presence of a 276 conserved caveolin binding (CBD) domain in ZIKV (and DENV) but not in YFV NS1 (Fig 9F) .

Molecular docking predicts a favorable 290 interaction between the NS1 hydrophobic domain including the grease fingers, where the CBD 291 is located, with a pocket in the CAV-1 scaffolding domain (CSD) with distances less 8\u01fa ( Fig 9A   292 and 9B). The molecular docking results obtained with CAV-1 and NS1 were used as a control to 293 carry on additional docking experiments between the DENV NS1 or CAV-1 and the CCC 294 chaperones FKBP52, Cy40 and CyA. Calculations of the energy binding of several docking 295 clusters showed that the DENV NS1 has the lowest and more favorable energy for CAV-1, 296 compared to the energy binding obtained for FKBP52, Cy40 or CyA. In addition, lower energies 297 were obtained for the binding of CAV-1 with the other chaperones of the CCC, than for the 298 binding of NS1 with those same chaperones ( Fig 9C) . Based in the free energies data, we predict 299 a model of interaction of NS1 with the CCC proteins in which FKBP52, Cy40 and CyA are directly 300 bound to CAV-1, and NS1 is bound to the CCC through the CAV-1 scaffolding domain ( Fig 9D) .

Therefore, in the present work, we explored the association of NS1 with 307 proteins involved, together with CAV-1, in the intracellular transport of cholesterol and the 308 dependence of NS1 secretion on such association. The results revealed that NS1 is associated 309 to the chaperone caveolin complex (CAV-1, Cy40, FKBP52 and CyA) and that the integrity of 310 this complex is necessary for the secretion of NS1 in mosquito infected cells. Additional data 311 suggest that in virus infected mosquito cells, ZIKV NS1, but not yellow fever virus NS1, also 312 associates with CAV-1 and usurps the cholesterol traffic pathways for secretion. Thus, the lipid 313 content or molecular structure of the DENV NS1 seems to have taken advantage of mosquito 314 cell cholesterol transport to guarantee the efficient NS1 secretion in the mosquito vector.

Yet, as an 326 additional tool to study classical secretion in mosquito cell lines, an efficient Gaussia luciferase 327 reporter system that enables the detection of Luciferase in cell supernatants 6 hours after 328 transfection was developed. The secretion of luciferase was significantly affected after treatment 329 with GCA and BFA (data not shown); these data, together with the observed inhibition of viral 330 particle release, indicates the existence of a robust classical secretion pathway in mosquito cells.

Further analysis also showed, high energy binding 372 through hydrophobic dynamics, between the NS1 \uf062-roll domain and FKBP52, CyA and Cy40 373 with distances under 6\u01fa. However, the model predicts all these proteins interacting at the same 374 domain in NS1 (data not shown), which seems unlikely, due to steric effects. Thus, we favor an 375 alternative molecular docking model, based on interaction energies, in which NS1 is bound 376 directly to CAV-1, and in turn FKBP52, CyA and Cy40 are bound to CAV-1 (Fig. 10D ). This 377 model still allowed interaction of NS1 with the CCC through membranes. However, if the NS1-378 CCC complex will traffic to the plasma membrane as a free-cytosolic complex or membrane 379 associated is totally unknown.
