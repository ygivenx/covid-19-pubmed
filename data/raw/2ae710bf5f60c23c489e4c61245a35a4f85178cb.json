{"title": "Heat inactivation of serum interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2", "body": "The current outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is posing a serious threat to public health. [1] [2] [3] Early diagnosis of suspect cases is critical to reduce and interrupt the transmission of COVID-19 from person-to-person. 4 Currently, laboratory testing of viral nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay is the \"gold standard\" for COVID-19 diagnosing. 5 However, the requirement of sophisticated instruments and laboratory conditions, tedious experimental procedures, and longer detection time significantly hamper its widespread applicability. 4 Antibodies produced in the blood after COVID-19 infection are emerging as a promising class of biomarkers. 6 The antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are specific, sensitive, and more importantly, their detection can be much faster and simpler than RT-PCR, which allows rapid screening of suspect cases to be possible. 7 All the biological specimens for COVID-19 testing should be considered to be potentially infectious. Therefore, test must be performed by medical professionals with protective equipment in a qualified laboratory. To further reduce the risk of exposure to infectious agents, viral inactivation before sample handling are usually be recommended. 8, 9 While the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to the conditions of inactivation is unknown, it is reported that many coronavirus such as SARS are heat-sensitive and can be killed at 56 \u2103 for 30 minutes. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] It is thus inferred that heating at 56 \u2103 could be an effective approach for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. 15 However, the effect of heating at 56 \u2103 on COVID-19 antibody detection is unclear.

We found that after heat inactivation, all of the serum IgM (100%) demonstrated significantly lower levels. For IgG, 64.71% of the sample levels dropped after heat inactivation.\n\nAll immunological assays are highly dependent on the recognition and binding of antigens to antibodies. The decrease in SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels may be related to their structural change of denaturation and aggregation. 16, 17 Previous studies have shown that antibodies can be denatured and lose their antigen binding activities after heating, 18 and IgM is reported to be less thermally stable than IgG 19,20 due to their different compositions and structures of heavy chains. 21 This is consistent with our results that SARS-CoV-2 IgM concentration decreased more significantly than IgG after heating.

These results suggests that heat inactivation of serum can lead to false-negative results in these samples.\n\nHeat inactivation of serum at 56 \u2103 for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. For highly suspected cases, the possibility of false-negative results should be considered if the sample was inactivated by heating."}
