{"title": "Detection of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus and Mycoplasma hyorhinis Antigens in Pulmonary Lesions of Pigs Suffering from Respiratory Distress", "body": "Pneumonia is a worldwide problem for the pig industry. A recent outbreak of pneumonia in Japan was aetiologically linked to porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV) Shimizu et al., 1994) , which was first isolated from pigs with reproductive failure or respiratory disease in the Netherlands Wensvoort et al., 1991) . The pneumonic features may vary with the presence of other organisms. In the USA and Great Britain, organisms isolated from PRRSV-seropositive herds with severe endemic respiratory disease have included porcine respiratory coronavirus (Halbur et al., 1993) , swine influenza virus (Kay et al., 1994) , PasteureUa multocida (Hopper et al., 1992) and Salmonella choleraesuis (Stevenson et al., 1993) . However, there has been no description of a relationship between PRRSV and Mycoplasma hyorhinis in pig pneumonia.\n\nThis paper describes an immunohistopathological and microbiological study of the lung lesions in 11 field cases of severe respiratory disease and five experimentally infected pigs, and throws light on the effects of dual infection with M. hyorhinis and PRRSV.\n\nEleven pigs aged 1 to 2 months and showing severe respiratory distress (dyspnoea or abdominal breathing) were collected from three pig farms in Chiba prefecture, an Shimizu et al., 1994) . The pigs were humanely killed and subjected to post mortem examination.\n\nFive specific pathogen-free pigs, aged 2 months and seronegative for PRRSV, were housed in isolation units. Each pig was inoculated intranasally with 1 ml of a suspension containing 106.0 TCIDs0 of the Chiba 92-1 strain of PRRSV (Shimizu et al., 1994) .\n\nThe inoculated pigs were observed for clinical signs, killed 35 days later, necropsied, and examined by the same methods as those (see below) used for the field cases.\n\nViral isolation was carried out as described by Wensvoort et al. (1991) . Briefly, after centrifugation of 10% lung homogenates, the supernates were inoculated into porcine alveolar macrophage cultures. The cells were observed daily for cytopathogenic effects and infection was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence. Bacteria (Haemophilus sp., Actinomyces sp., Pasteurella sp., Streptococcus sp. and others) were isolated on YTB agar, consisting of trypticase soy agar medium (Difco, Detroit, USA) containing fresh yeast extract 1% (Gibco, Paisley, Scotland) and horse blood 5%. Isolates were identified by biochemical tests (Holt et al., 1994) (Difco) and on BHL agar (Difco). The isolates were identified by biochemical properties (Aluotto et al., 1970) and metabolism inhibition tests. Antibody to PRRSV was detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, Maine, USA).\n\nAt necropsy, the lungs were examined visually and each cranial lobe was fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. Sections 4 to 5 gm thick were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE) or by an immunohistochemical technique.\n\nThe PRRSV and selected bacterial antigens were demonstrated with an avidinbiotin-complex immunoperoxidase kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Embedded tissues were dewaxed, rehydrated through graded alcohols into phosphatebuffered saline pH 7\"4, and then treated with acfinase E (Kaken Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Tokyo) 0\" 1% in phosphate buffered saline for 5 min at 37~ The sections were incubated for 1 h with anti-PRRSV (Chiba 92-1 strain) rabbit serum at a dilution of 1 in 8192, or with one of the following antibacterial rabbit sera: mixed anti-ActinobaciUus pleuropneumoniae (serovars 1-6) serum at a dilution of 1 in 8192 (provided by Drs K. Institute of Animal Health), mixed anti-Escherichia coli (serovars O 8, 9, 15, 45, 78, 88, 101, 117, 153) hyorhinis serum at a dilution of 1 in 4096. Sections were counterstained with methyl green. Tissue sections from non-infected gnotobiotic pigs and serum from a nonimmunized rabbit were used for control purposes.\n\nThe macroscopical changes, distributed throughout the lungs, were a failure to collapse, consolidation and moderate interlobular oedema. The lung lesions were of two histopathological types. One type was characterized by severe proliferative and interstitial pneumonia, with marked infiltration of mononuclear cells; the alveolar spaces contained proteinaceous debris, degenerating cells and macrophages (Fig. 1 a) . In the other type, proliferative and interstitial pneumonia was complicated by suppurative bronchopneumonia, the alveolar septa being moderately thickened by cellular proliferation and most alveolar spaces being occupied by neutrophils and macrophages (Fig. lb) ; occasionally, the lumina of the bronchioles contained neutrophils and proteinaceous debris. In both types of lesion there was slight peribronchiolar lymphocytic hyperplasia.\n\nImmunohistochemically, a moderate to large amount of PRRSV antigen was demonstrated in the lungs of 10 pigs. In the interstitial pneumonic lesion, PRRSV antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of macrophages, degenerating cells or cell debris in the alveolar spaces (Figs l c and d) . It was found occasionally in the mononuclear cells within the alveolar septa. M. hyorhinis antigen was observed frequently on the bronchiolar epithelium and in degenerated neutrophils in the alveolar spaces of seven pigs (Figs l e and t). Small to moderate amounts of P. multocida, H. parasuis and E. coli antigens were also found in the degenerated cells, corresponding to the suppurative bronchopneumonia (Table 1) .\n\nAll five pigs inoculated with PRRSV showed mild depression, anorexia and periocular oedema 2 to 3 days after inoculation. However, all except one (see below) of the pigs had recovered clinically by 14 days after inoculation. The lungs of those that recovered had no gross lesions at necropsy but showed mild interstitial pneumonia, characterized by slight thickening of the alveolar septa and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes. A small amount of PRRSV antigen was found post mortem within the cytoplasm of macrophages in the alveolar spaces and septa in two of the four recovered pigs, but M. hyorhinis antigen was not detected.\n\nOne pig (no. 5) showed abdominal breathing and died 22 days after inoculation. At necropsy it showed severe proliferative and interstitial pneumonia complicated by suppurative bronchopneumonia. A large amount of PRRSV antigen was observed within macrophages in the alveolar spaces (Fig. 2a) . Moreover, M. hyorhinis antigen was found on the epithelial cells of the bronchioles and in the alveolar spaces (Fig. 2b) . A small amount of E. coli antigen was also found on the surface of epithelial cells of the bronchioles (Table 1) \n\nThe serum samples from the 11 field cases and from four of the experimentally infected pigs contained antibody to PRRSV. This virus was isolated from three field and three experimental cases, and heavy cultures of M. hyorhinis died. Light cultures of P. multocida, PasteureUa spp. and E. coli were isolated from the lungs of four field cases and one experimental pig. These results are summarized in Table 1 .\n\nIn the field, clinical signs of PRRS vary considerably. After investigating the clinical signs of 3612 sows in 16 herds, De Jong et al. (1991) reported that 50% of the pigs had anorexia, up to 10% had fever, and up to 30% had respiratory distress: Sh~mizu et al. (1994) also pointed out that PRRSV-infected pigs showed abdominal breathing at the late stage of the disease. In the present study, 11 field cases with severe dyspnoea or abdominal breathing had pneumonic lesions throughout the lungs and antibody against PRRSV. Clinically and virologically, they resembled pigs in previously reported outbreaks of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. Pathologically, the predominant lung lesion in the field cases was moderate to severe proliferative and interstitial pneumonia, with slight suppurative bronchopneumonia. The lesion was composed of interstitial infiltration of mononuclear cells, accumulations of macrophages and cell debris in the alveolar spaces. A large amount of PRRSV antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of macrophages and in cell debris in the lesions. M. hyorhinis was also found on the surface of broncho-alveolar epithelial cells and degenerated neutrophils. The bacteria were closely associated with the pneumonic lesions. The pathological changes in four of five pigs experimentally infected with PRRSV resembled those described by investigators in Canada (Dea et al., 1992) and the USA (Yoon et al., 1992; Rossow et al., 1994) . These infected pigs were kept in isolation houses, but one of them died 22 days after inoculation with virus. At necropsy it had severe pneumonitis and a heavy culture ofM. hyorhinis was isolated from the lung lesion, together with PRRSV. The pathological findings in the pig that died, including the detection of PRRSV and M. hyorhinis antigens, were almost the same as those in the 11 field cases. Therefore, if there had been no enhancement of M. hyorhinis proliferation in the lung of experimental pig no. 5, the pneumonitis caused by PRRSV infection might have resolved, as in the other four experimentally infected pigs.\n\nInfection by other pathogens, such as Streptococcus suis, Salmonella choleraesuis, P. multocida and H, parasius, increases in incidence and severity in PRRSVseropositive pig herds (Hopper et al., 1992; Stevenson et al., 1993; Done and Paton, 1995) . Galina et al. (1994) stated that infection by PRRSV predisposed to disease caused by Streptococcus suis. M. hyorhinis is frequently isolated from pneumonic lesions of slaughtered pigs (L'Ecuyer et al., 1961; Gois et al., 1975) , but its ability to cause pneumonia is unclear. Experimentally, some strains of M. hyorhinis produced slight bronchopneumonia or interstitial pneumonia in gnotobiotic pigs (Friis, 1971 ; Gois et al., 1971 ) and specific fluorescence for M. hyorhinis antigen was detected on the bronchial epithelium by indirect fluorescent-antibody staining (Gois et al., 1971 ). In the present study, isolation of PRRSV was not always successful, but PRRSV infection was confirmed in all pigs serologically or immunohistochemically.\n\nM. hyorhinis was found in all of 11 field cases and in one pig that died of experimental infection. Such pigs had severe interstitial pneumonia and suppurative bronchopneumonia. These findings suggest that dual infection with PRRSV and M. hyorhinis induced severe pulmonary lesions. It is well known that some micro-organisms, such as Mycoplasmaflocculare and M. hyorhinis, can regularly be isolated, not only from the upper respiratory tract but also from the bronchial tree, of conventionally reared pigs (Christensen and Mousing, 1992) . Potentially pathogenic micro-organisms in the respiratory tract may be an important factor in the causation of severe PRRSV infection.\n\nThe present study suggests that M. hyorhinis plays a major role in PRRSV infection in Japan."}
