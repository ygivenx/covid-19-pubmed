To get an approximation of buried interface, the surface area of single subunits was subtracted by the surface area of T1 or T2 with PyMol and get_area input order. Here, nsp7/nsp8 in T1/2 is the buried surface between a single subunit and the complex. nsp8I:nsp8I/nsp8II:nsp8II is the buried surface by the nsp8 scaffold alone.\n\nBuried surface (\u00c5 2 ) Buried surface (%)  T1 total  10281  100  nsp7  2153  21  nsp8I  2988  29  nsp8I:nsp8I  835  8  T2 total  10377  100  nsp7 1988 19 nsp8II 3201 31 nsp8II:nsp8II 1214 12 Compared to the monomeric mass species the signals converted to mass fractions of nsp7, nsp8, nsp9 and nsp10 were found evenly distributed, indicating that they well represent the equimolar presence of nsp's (Equations listed in Table S 4 ). This result shows that a plot of the mass fractions could be used to observe relative concentrations directly from the ratios. Furthermore, instrument parameters and response factors appear to have less influence than expected. However, previously it was shown that with a similar instrument, larger species give more intense signals [1] . Also here, the tested nsp's (~9.5-15 kDa) may have different ion efficiencies than larger species, e.g. nsp7-10 and M pro (~59 kDa and ~69 kDa), and should therefore not be compared directly. The rel. int. ratio of monomers by using the intensities of all charge states assigned to monomers (AVG.\u00b1SD, N=3; 10\u00b11%, 19\u00b13%, 30\u00b14% and 41\u00b11%). The ratio of mass fraction (MF) is the SR ratio, corrected for all non-covalent complexes (AVG.\u00b1SD, N=3; 23\u00b13%, 26\u00b13%, 24\u00b13% and 28\u00b13%). Figure S 9: Gas-phase dissociation pathways of nsp7+8(2:2). Two alternative dissociation pathways of SARS-CoV tetramer and interaction of subunits within the tetramer as concluded from CID spectra. Main pathway (top): Initially, nsp7+8(2:2) dissociates into nsp7 and nsp7+8(1:2), suggesting a peripheral positioning of nsp7 within the complex. In a follow-up dissociation, nsp7+8(1:1) is detected at elevated collisional energy. Alternative pathway (bottom): At higher collisional energy, dissociation into nsp8 and nsp7+8(2:1) is preferred. nsp8 dimers appear as well. Interaction map: Subunit interactions as concluded from CID-MS results. Symbols illustrate molecular ions from different mass species found as dissociating ions in CID. Black arrows indicate for the ejected ions. Dashed arrows indicate for unobserved dissociations that most likely follow up. Charge states labelled taken from dissociating ions found in CID of SARS-CoV nsp7+8 (2:2) (+14) and when combined match the charge state of the precursor ion."}
