{"title": "INHIBITORY EFFECT OF EMODIN ON RAW 264.7 ACTIVATED WITH DOUBLE STRANDED RNA\nANALOGUE POLY I:C", "body": "To date, pandemic viral diseases such as Ebola hemorrhagic fever and Zika virus infection\nis still being undissolved. Both Ebola virus and Zika virus belong to the single-stranded\nRNA virus. In 2015, people of South Korea suffered from Middle East respiratory syndrome\ncaused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (a novel positive-sense,\nsingle-stranded RNA virus of the genus Betacoronavirus). Recently, Zika virus disease in\nSouth America was reported to be dangerous for public health. Thus, it deserves to\ncontemplate how to effectively deal with new pandemic infectious diseases such as Ebola\nhemorrhagic fever, Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Zika\nvirus infection, and avian influenza.\n\nCytokine is one of important elements in immunity and inflammation; cytokines are known to\nbe small proteins; as a cell signalling molecule, cytokine plays a role in autocrine,\nparacrine, and endocrine mechanism of immunomodulation; cytokine are produced not only\nimmune cells but also endothelial cells and fibroblasts; cytokines are classified as\ninterleukins, lymphokines, interferons, tumor necrosis factors, colony stimulating factors,\nand chemokines; cytokines bind cell-surface receptors, which triggers intracellular\nsignalling and host responses to infection, trauma, cancer, immune reaction, and other\ninflammatory phenomena; the concentration of circulating cytokine can increase up to\n1,000-fold in the case of infection or trauma; the dysregulation of cytokines might become\npathological in inflammation and be linked to various diseases ranging from\nneuroinflammatory diseases to cancer.\n\nImmunity and inflammation play an important role in protecting human body from pathogenic\ninfections including viral infection. Infections with virus sometimes provoke unregulated\nhyper-inflammation such as cytokine storm and the uncontrolled inflammatory reaction caused\nby viral infection could be harmful to human life (Hu et al., 2014). \u2019Cytokine\nstorm\u2019 is one of major characteristics caused by the pandemic viral infection and\nleads to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (Sordillo and Helson, 2015). Thus, cytokine\nstorm is becoming one of important topics concerned with caring incurable pandemic viral\ndiseases.\n\nEmodin (3-methyl-1, 6, 8-trihydroxyanthraquinone) is a compound which can be found in\nPolygoni Multiflori Radix (PMR). PMR is the root of Polygonum multiflorum.\nPMR is used to treat dizziness, spermatorrhea, constipation, sores, scrofula, prematurely\ngray hair, goiter, and neck lumps as well as chronic malaria traditionally in Korea and\nChina (Thiruvengadam et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2010; Avula et al., 2007). According to the\npharmacological theory of Korean Medicine, PMR is known to taste bitter, sweet, and acerbic;\nPMR has a warm character and is nontoxic; the pharmacological activity of PMR is mainly done\nthrough Liver Meridian, Heart Meridian, and Kidney Meridian; the efficacy of PMR is\ncomplementing Liver function, strengthening Kidney function, nourishing Blood-part, removing\nWind-pathogen, benefiting Essence-part; some herbal formulae including PMR are used as the\nmedicinal drug; for example, the herbal composition of PMR, Panax Ginseng Radix, Angelica\nGigas Radix, Anemarrhenae Asphodeloidis Radix, and Amydae Carapax could be used for chronic\nintermittent fever and chills similar to chronic malaria; the herbal composition of PMR,\nSophora flavescens Radix, Dictamnus dasycarpus Radicis Cortex, and Schizonepeta tenuifolia\nHerba can be used to treat itching; the herbal composition of PMR, Rehmannia glutinosa Radix\nPreparata, and Cornus officinalis fructus can be used to treat strengthen liver and kidney\nfunction (Chen et al., 2016)\n\nMany RNA viruses make cytosolic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) during the replication process\nin the infected cell. Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthetic analog of\ndsRNA, is regarded as a viral mimic toll-like receptor 3 stimulant (Lee et al., 2011) and\npoly I:C is used to stimulate macrophages in in vitro assay for evaluating\nanti-inflammatory activity on viral infections. It is well known that dsRNA could trigger\nmacrophage activation. Molecular patterns of invasive pathogens might be recognized by\ntoll-like receptors on cell membrane or Nod-like receptors inside cytoplasm of immune cells,\nwhich activates an inflammatory cascade and results in the massive expression of\ninflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide and cytokine.\n\nAlthough Choi et al. have reported the anti-inflammatory activity of emodin in\nlipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 (Choi et al., 2013), effects of emodin on\nvirus-induced macrophages are not fully reported. In this study, we investigated effects of\nemodin on poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7 by in vitro assay. Data represents\nthat emodin inhibits productions of NO, cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in poly\nI:C-induced RAW 264.7 via calcium -STAT pathway.\n\nDMEM, FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, PBS, and other tissue culture reagents were\npurchased from Gibco BRL (Grand Island, NY, USA). Emodin, poly I:C, indomethacin, Griess\nreagent, and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).\nThe multiplex bead-based cytokine assay kits used for the determination of cytokine\nconcentration were purchased from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). The Fluo-4 calcium assay\nkit was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR, USA). QuantiGene Plex 2.0 Reagent\nSystem for direct quantification of multiple RNA targets was purchased from Panomics\n(Redwood City, CA, USA).\n\nRAW 264.7 were obtained from the Korea Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea). RAW 264.7 cells\nwere cultured and cell viability was evaluated with MTT assay according to the previous\nstudy (Lee et al., 2011) with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).\n\nNO concentration in culture medium was determined by the Griess reaction (Lee et al.,\n2011) according to the previous study (Lee et al., 2011) with a microplate reader\n(Bio-Rad).\n\nThis assay was performed with multiplex cytokine assay kits and Bio-Plex 200 suspension\narray system (Bio-Rad) as described previously (Lee et al., 2011). The following cytokine\nproductions were analyzed: interleukin (ILHo, IL-\u03c6, IL-6, IL-10, granulocyte\nmacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor\n(G-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), macrophage inflammatory protein\n(MIP)-^ MIP-^, MIP-2, CXCL10 (IP-10), monocyte chemotactic activating factor\n(MCP)-1, RANTES, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; IL-6 class cytokine),\nlipopolysaccharide-induced CXC chemokine (LIX; CXCL5), and tumor necrosis factor -\u03b1\n(TNF-\u03b1).\n\nIntracellular calcium level was determined using Fluo-4 assay according to the previous\nstudy (Lee et al., 2011) with a spectrofluorometer (Dynex, West Sussex, UK) with\nexcitation and emission filters of 485 nm and 535 nm, respectively.\n\nThe mRNA expression of STAT1 (GenBank: NM_009283) was evaluated with the bead-based\nQuantiGene Plex assay according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The relative mRNA\nlevel of each sample for STAT1 was normalized to that of GAPDH (GenBank:\nNM_001001303).\n\nThe data represent the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments. Significant\ndifferences were examined using one-way analysis of variance test followed by\nTukey\u2019s multiple comparison test with SPSS 11.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\nUSA). In all cases, a P value < 0.05 was considered\nsignificant.\n\nIn this study, emodin up to a concentration of 50 \u03bcM restored the cell viability\nin poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7. The cell viability in poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7 incubated\nwith emodin at concentrations of 5, 10, 25, and 50 \u03bcM for 24 h were 118.6 \u00b1\n20.12%, 122.05 \u00b1 14.24%, 114.72 \u00b1 12.99%, and 116.48\n\u00b1 10.1% of the control value, respectively. With this result, emodin\nconcentrations of up to 50 \u03bcM were chosen for subsequent experiments (Figure 2A).\n\nData represented that emodin significantly inhibits excessive production of NO in poly\nI:C-induced RAW 264.7 (Figure 2B). The NO production\nin poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7 incubated with emodin at concentrations of 5, 10, 25, and 50\n\u03bcM for 24 h were 85.29 \u00b1 4.93%, 83.55 \u00b1 5.18%, 81.59\n\u00b1 4.64%, and 79.30 \u00b1 5.6% of the control value,\nrespectively.\n\nEmodin significantly inhibited cytokine\u2019s productions in poly I:C-induced RAW\n264.7 (Figure 3; Figure\n4). In details, IL-1 \u03b1 productions in RAW 264.7 incubated with media only,\npoly I:C only, emodin (10 \u03bcM) plus poly I:C, emodin (25 plus poly I:C, emodin (50\nplus poly I:C, and indomethacin plus poly I:C for 24 h were 214.43 \u00b1 45.69 pg/mL,\n4531.5 \u00b1 1888.25 pg/mL, 1312.5 \u00b1 128.4 pg/mL (P <\n0.05 vs. poly I:C only), 550.25 \u00b1 86.58 pg/mL (P < 0.01 vs.\npoly I:C only), 261.88 \u00b1 27.23 pg/mL (P < 0.01 vs. poly I:C\nonly), and 248.5 \u00b1 41.24 pg/mL, respectively; IL-1\u03b2 productions were 74.0\n\u00b1 10.46 pg/mL, 288.88 \u00b1 89.69 pg/mL, 136.5 \u00b1 6.81 pg/mL\n(P < 0.05 vs. poly I:C only), 85.75 \u00b1 2.25 pg/mL\n(P < 0.01 vs. poly I:C only), 71.0 \u00b1 4.02 pg/mL\n(P < 0.01 vs. poly I:C only), and 61.88 \u00b1 1.18 pg/mL;\nIL-6 productions were 144.93 \u00b1 27.17 pg/mL, 23243.5 \u00b1 4977.11 pg/mL, 9966.0\n\u00b1 1524.36 pg/mL (P < 0.01 vs. poly I:C only), 6680.13\n\u00b1 828.28 pg/mL (P < 0.01 vs. poly I:C only), 925.0 \u00b1\n248.76 pg/mL (P < 0.001 vs. poly I:C only), and 241.75 \u00b1\n58.62 pg/mL; GM-CSF productions were 132.14 \u00b1 24.01 pg/mL, 3371.0 \u00b1 1369.23\npg/mL, 1586.88 \u00b1 101.71 pg/mL (P < 0.05 vs. poly I:C only),\n1078.88 \u00b1 115.1 pg/mL (P < 0.05 vs. poly I:C only), 211.38\n\u00b1 9.18 pg/mL (P < 0.01 vs. poly I:C only), and 107.0\n\u00b1 7.26 pg/mL; G-CSF productions were 532.08 \u00b1 244.9 pg/mL, 30629.88 \u00b1\n135.87 pg/mL, 29767.63 \u00b1 177.41 pg/mL (P < 0.001 vs. poly\nI:C only), 30030.5 \u00b1 257.09 pg/mL (P < 0.01 vs. poly I:C\nonly), 29766.63 \u00b1 440.0 pg/mL (P < 0.05 vs. poly I:C only),\nand 18905.13 \u00b1 2537.64 pg/mL; M-CSF productions were 120.14 \u00b1 14.72 pg/mL,\n159.13 \u00b1 19.01 pg/mL, 116.38 \u00b1 2.29 pg/mL (P < 0.01\nvs. poly I:C only), 130.13 \u00b1 9.54 pg/mL (P < 0.05 vs. poly\nI:C only), 115.63 \u00b1 3.82 pg/mL (P < 0.01 vs. poly I:C\nonly), and 95.38 \u00b1 3.97 pg/mL; TNF-\u03b1 productions were 1096.88 \u00b1\n289.84 pg/mL, 23294.75 \u00b1 1810.21 pg/mL, 23111.75 \u00b1 473.83 pg/mL\n(P > 0.05 vs. poly I:C only), 22388.67 \u00b1 1747.93 pg/mL\n(P > 0.05 vs. poly I:C only), 21271.63 \u00b1 1867.28 pg/mL\n(P > 0.05 vs. poly I:C only), and 22405.25 \u00b1 672.02\npg/mL; IL-10 productions were 88.36 \u00b1 13.29 pg/mL, 253.13 \u00b1 99.84 pg/mL,\n142.13 \u00b1 13.86 pg/mL (P > 0.05 vs. poly I:C only), 205.13\n\u00b1 63.88 pg/mL (P > 0.05 vs. poly I:C only), 168.38 \u00b1\n48.18 pg/mL (P > 0.05 vs. poly I:C only), and 76.13 \u00b1 7.64\npg/mL; MCP-1 productions were 136.14 \u00b1 28.53 pg/mL, 22243.75 \u00b1 4701.86\npg/mL, 11139.38 \u00b1 3717.66 pg/mL (P < 0.05 vs. poly I:C\nonly), 2352.25 \u00b1 784.77 pg/mL (P < 0.001 vs. poly I:C\nonly), 250.0 \u00b1 55.87 pg/mL (P < 0.001 vs. poly I:C only),\nand 101.25 \u00b1 7.09 pg/mL; MIP-^ productions were 28051.64 \u00b1 1506.35\npg/mL, 31009.88 \u00b1 230.92 pg/mL, 30027.5 \u00b1 191.56 pg/mL (P\n< 0.01 vs. poly I:C only), 30284.0 \u00b1 308.35 pg/mL (P\n< 0.01 vs. poly I:C only), 30220.5 \u00b1 226.22 pg/mL (P\n< 0.01 vs. poly I:C only), and 29296.63 \u00b1 207.43 pg/mL; MIP-^\nproductions were 27142.86 \u00b1 1588.67 pg/mL, 30357.0 \u00b1 176.58 pg/mL, 29383.0\n\u00b1 278.2 pg/mL (P < 0.01 vs. poly I:C only), 29511.75\n\u00b1 172.42 pg/mL (P < 0.001 vs. poly I:C only), 29435.63\n\u00b1 461.03 pg/mL (P < 0.05 vs. poly I:C only), and 27760.88\n\u00b1 284.25 pg/mL; MIP-2 productions were 276.64 \u00b1 190.26 pg/mL, 30573.63\n\u00b1 128.84 pg/mL, 29575.13 \u00b1 161.94 pg/mL (P < 0.001\nvs. poly I:C only), 29880.75 \u00b1 176.97 pg/mL (P < 0.01 vs.\npoly I:C only), 29589.5 \u00b1 367.64 pg/mL (P < 0.01 vs. poly\nI:C only), and 28463.13 \u00b1 235.65 pg/mL; RANTES productions were 396.14 \u00b1\n123.14 pg/mL, 28046.0 \u00b1 714.64 pg/mL, 26238.0 \u00b1 299.63 pg/mL\n(P < 0.01 vs. poly I:C only), 26401.17 \u00b1 403.62 pg/mL\n(P < 0.05 vs. poly I:C only), 25690.25 \u00b1 731.67 pg/mL\n(P < 0.01 vs. poly I:C only), and 23804.75 \u00b1 241.02\npg/mL; IP-10 productions were 6462.64 \u00b1 2226.76 pg/mL, 29242.0 \u00b1 258.89\npg/mL, 25910.88 \u00b1 700.89 pg/mL (P < 0.001 vs. poly I:C\nonly), 26720.88 \u00b1 651.6 pg/mL (P < 0.001 vs. poly I:C\nonly), 25845.75 \u00b1 759.08 pg/mL (P < 0.001 vs. poly I:C\nonly), and 24266.13 \u00b1 496.65 pg/mL; LIF productions were 154.07 \u00b1 29.67\npg/mL, 24987.13 \u00b1 754.81 pg/mL, 22950.75 \u00b1 907.25 pg/mL (P\n< 0.05 vs. poly I:C only), 24999.38 \u00b1 487.17 pg/mL (P\n> 0.05 vs. poly I:C only), 24440.38 \u00b1 362.56 pg/mL (P\n> 0.05 vs. poly I:C only), and 3283.5 \u00b1 249.74 pg/mL; LIX productions were\n994.79 \u00b1 92.36 pg/mL, 24741.5 \u00b1 1632.49 pg/mL, 23491.0 \u00b1 1907.13\npg/mL (P > 0.05 vs. poly I:C only), 23338.75 \u00b1 1485.07\npg/mL (P > 0.05 vs. poly I:C only), 24446.38 \u00b1 320.22 pg/mL\n(P > 0.05 vs. poly I:C only), and 10588.88 \u00b1 3139.32\npg/mL.\n\nIn the present study, emodin significantly inhibited the calcium release in poly\nI:C-induced RAW 264.7 (Figure 5). The calcium release\nin poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7 incubated with emodin at concentrations of 5, 10, 25, and 50\n\u03bcM for 24 h were 90.9 \u00b1 6.21%, 92.3 \u00b1 5.79%, 94.2\n\u00b1 4.3%, and 91.41 \u00b1 5.27% of the control value,\nrespectively.\n\nThe mRNA expression of STAT1 in poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7 incubated with emodin at\nconcentrations of 10, 25, and 50 \u03bcM for 24 h were 36.14 \u00b1 2.56%,\n20.17 \u00b1 2.87%, and 16.97 \u00b1 1.56% of the control value,\nrespectively (Figure 6). Specifically, emodin\nsignificantly decreased STAT1 mRNA expression of poly I:C-activated mouse macrophages in a\ndose-dependent manner.\n\nThe newly occurring viral disease has become an important issue for the world public health\nmore and more. For example, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Middle East respiratory syndrome,\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome, Zika virus infection, and avian influenza are still\nhazardous to the health of specific regional people, which might attain the world level.\nTill now, effective and safe drugs for these pandemic diseases have not been reported. It is\ndifficult and expensive to develop a suitable vaccine for a new viral disease in time.\nTherefore, nontoxic and immuno-modulatory herbal materials attract researcher\u2019s\nattention in these days. The property of herbal medicines noticed by researchers is not the\nremoval of pathogenic virus in human body but modulating immune reaction against viral\ninfection because the antiviral agent sometimes shows a side effect. For example, Yoon et\nal. reported the anti-inflammatory activity of Scutellaria baicalensis radix water extract\n(Yoon et al., 2009) and Yuk et al. reported the anti-inflammatory activity of Epimedium\nbrevicornum herba water extract (Yuk et al., 2010). In the addition, Kim et al. have\nreported that the water extract of Liriope Platyphylla tuber represents anti-inflammation\nefficacy through in vitro assay using LPS-triggered mouse macrophages in\nthe recent study (Kim et al., 2016).\n\nPMR is traditionally used to treat various inflammatory diseases in Korea and China. In\nKorean Medicine, the herbal composition of PMR, Lycium chinense Fructus, Psoraleae\nCorylifoliae Fructus, and Cuscuta chinensis Semen can be used to treat premature graying of\nthe hair and premature aging.\n\nImportant ingredients of PMR are oxymethylanthraquinone, emodin, sargencuneside,\nchrysophanol, rhein, physcion, and chrysophanol anthrone, lecithin, questin, polygonimitin\nB, polygonimitin C as well as starch and fatty oils (Cho et al., 2010; Avula et al., 2007;\nPark et al., 2016). Thiruvengadam et al. have reported that emodin is an active component of\nPMR (Thiruvengadam et al., 2014). Other name of emodin is 3-methyl-1, 6,\n8-trihydroxyanthraquinone. Various studies for bioactive potentials of emodin have been\nreported: Hwang et al. reported anti-tumor, antibacterial, vasorelaxant, and diuretic\neffects of emodin (Hwang et al., 2013). Wei et al. reported the anti-tumor effect of emodin\non human tongue squamous cancer and gastric cancer (Wei et al., 2013). In the addition, Cha\net al. reported that emodin induces androgen receptor degradation (Cha et al., 2005). Lim et\nal. reported the inhibitory effect of emodin on phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction (Lim\net al., 2014). Interestingly, Li et al. reported emodin inhibited the nuclear translocation\nof NF-\u03ba\u03b2 in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 (Li et al., 2005). Xiao et al. also reported\nemodin potently inhibits LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation and cytokine production in mice\n(Xiao et al., 2014). However, the inhibitory effect of emodin on viral inflammation in human\nbody is not fully reported. Thus, we investigated effects of emodin on poly I:C-induced RAW\n264.7 by in vitro assay in this study.\n\nImmunity is regarded to be a necessary function for human life but, at the same time, it is\nthought to be a double-edged sword biologically. For example, the strong inflammatory\nreaction with immune activity in human body is a natural reaction against threats from\nanything which is infectious or foreign but the hyper-inflammation can be inversely a severe\nattack to human life itself. In the case of viral infection, such a double-sided character\nof immune activity is also embarrassing researchers of the bio-science. Immune reactions\ninclude inflammatory mediators. Among inflammatory mediators, cytokine is regarded to be one\nof very important elements in immunity and inflammation; cytokines are known to be small\nproteins (~20 kDa); as a cell signalling molecule, cytokine plays a role in\nautocrine, paracrine, and endocrine mechanism of immunomodulation; cytokine are produced not\nonly immune cells (macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, mast cells etc.) but\nalso endothelial cells and fibroblasts; cytokines are classified as interleukins,\nlymphokines, interferons, tumor necrosis factors, colony stimulating factors (G-CSF, GM-CSF,\nM-CSF etc.), and chemokines (IP-10, MCP-1, MHP-^, MIP-1\u03b2 MIP-2, RANTES etc.);\ncytokines bind cell-surface receptors, which triggers intracellular signalling and host\nresponses to infection, trauma, cancer, immune reaction, and other inflammatory phenomena;\nas in G-CSF and GM-CSF, some cytokines can be classified as growth factors; the\nconcentration of circulating cytokine can increase up to 1,000-fold in the case of infection\nor trauma; the dysregulation of cytokines might become pathological in inflammation.\n\nInfection caused by pathogens (such as bacteria, virus, fungus etc.) is always dangerous to\nhuman life. Inflammation with immune activity plays an important role in protecting human\nbody from pathogenic infections including the viral infection. However, the viral infection\nsometimes provokes the unregulated hyper-inflammation such as \u2019cytokine storm\n(hypercytokinemia)\u2019 (Sordillo and Helson, 2015). And the uncontrolled inflammatory\nreaction against viral infection could be harmful to human life (Hu et al., 2014; Pribul et\nal., 2008). Up to recently, studies on anti-virus vaccines and anti-viral drugs have been\nemphasized, but the present data shows that the modulation on cytokine productions caused by\nviral infectious diseases also deserves to be inspected carefully. Interestingly, Hutchinson\net al. have reported that chemokines such as (MCP-1, MIPs, RANTES, IP-10, etc.) are\nincreased in Ebola virus-infected primates (Hutchinson et al., 2001).\n\nPoly I:C, which is an analog of viral dsRNA and regarded as a viral mimic toll-like\nreceptor 3 stimulant, induces macrophages to produce various inflammatory mediators, which\nmight be related with dsRNA-relative macrophage activation (Maggi et al., 2000). It is well\nknown that dsRNA is produced during viral replication (Maggi et al., 2000). Additionally,\nIoi et al have reported that rotavirus, a kind of dsRNA virus, causes cytokine storm\nfollowed by Reye syndrome (Ioi et al., 2006). In this study, emodin inhibited the excess\nproduction of NO and cytokines in poly I:C-induced RAW 264.7. Data means that more study to\nevaluate the pathway of emodin\u2019s activity is required for a new antiviral\ntherapy.\n\nMeanwhile, the infection-induced excess production of NO leads to ER stress response\n(unfolded protein response), which increases the concentration of intracellular calcium and\nactivates STAT pathway (Gotoh et al., 2004; Timmins et al., 2009; Tabas et al., 2009; Wang\net al., 2012). As such, ER stress response is an important pathway of virus-induced\ninflammation. Because the experimental data represented emodin downregulated NO production\nand calcium release in RAW 264.7 as well as STAT1 mRNA expression, the inhibitory effect of\nemodin on cytokine production in poly I:C-induced macrophages might be achieved via\ncalcium-STAT pathway. But whether emodin regulates pyroptosis or apoptosis in poly\nI:C-induced macrophages is unclear in this study.\n\nBecause results of in vitro assay do not guarantee in\nvivo efficacy, it is insufficient to say that emodin can relieve cytokine storm\nin pandemic viral diseases. But this study deserves to be notified in order to develop a new\nmaterial for modulation of cytokine production from virus-induced macrophages. Again,\nfurther study needs to elucidate the exact intracellular pathway about the inhibitory effect\nof emodin and how to regulate macrophages on inflammation caused by viral infection.\n\nFinally, emodin exerts the inhibitory effect on productions of NO, IL-1\u03b1,\n\u03a0,-1\u03b2, IL-6, GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MEMo, MHP-^, MIP-2,\nand RANTES in poly I:C-induced macrophages via calcium-STAT pathway.\n\nEmodin has anti-inflammatory property related with its inhibition of NO, cytokines, growth\nfactors, and chemokines in poly I:C-induced macrophages via calcium-STAT pathway."}
