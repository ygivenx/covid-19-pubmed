{"title": "BAR scaffolds drive membrane fission by crowding disordered domains", "body": "Cellular membranes must undergo dynamic remodeling to facilitate essential cellular processes including formation of trafficking vesicles (Conner and Schmid, 2003) , viral egress (Hurley et al., 2010) , and cytokinesis (Mierzwa and Gerlich, 2014) . Since membranes resist deformation (Helfrich, 1973) , cells employ specialized protein machines to drive membrane remodeling (Zimmerberg and Kozlov, 2006) . For example, the crescent-shaped, dimeric bin-amphiphysin-rvs (BAR) domains Simunovic et al., 2015) polymerize into cylindrical scaffolds on membrane surfaces, forcing the underlying membrane to adopt the tubular geometry of the scaffold (Adam et al., 2015; Frost et al., 2008; . This rigid scaffold is thought to stabilize membrane tubules, preventing their division into separate membrane compartments through the process of membrane fission (Boucrot et al., 2012) .\n\nImportantly, most studies on the membrane shaping behavior of BAR domains have examined the BAR domain in isolation, with significant portions of the protein removed. Examples include the N-terminal amphipathic helix BAR (N-BAR) domain of amphiphysin (Peter et al., 2004) , the FCH BAR (F-BAR) domain of FCHo1/2 (Henne et al., 2010; Henne et al., 2007) , the F-BAR domain of the neuronal migration protein srGAP2 (Guerrier et al., 2009) , the F-BAR domains of the cytokinesis proteins Imp2 (McDonald et al., 2016) and Cdc15 (McDonald et al., 2015) , and the inverted BAR (I-BAR) domains of MIM and ABBA (Mattila et al., 2007; Saarikangas et al., 2009 ), among others. These results have provided critical insight into the detailed geometry of BAR domain arrangement at membrane surfaces, helping to elucidate their mechanisms of membrane curvature sensing and induction. However, BAR domains do not typically exist in isolation in the cell, but rather as part of large, multi-domain proteins which also frequently contain long, intrinsically-disordered protein (IDP) domains of several hundred amino acids (Henne et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2007; Miele et al., 2004; Wuertenberger and Groemping, 2015) . How might these disordered domains influence the membrane remodeling behavior of BAR domains? cells -what brings bulky domains together to generate steric pressure? In particular, what keeps crowded proteins from simply diffusing away from one another, dissipating steric pressure and inhibiting membrane shaping? Proteins such as amphiphysin (Miele et al., 2004; Peter et al., 2004) and FCHo1/2 (Henne et al., 2010; Henne et al., 2007) , which contain both scaffold-forming BAR domains and bulky disordered domains, present a possible solution to this problem. Specifically, the ability of BAR domains to form scaffolds has the potential to locally concentrate disordered domains such that steric pressure is amplified rather than dissipated.\n\nTherefore, we set out to investigate the impact of disordered domains on the membrane remodeling ability of BAR proteins. To our surprise, we found that while isolated BAR domains formed stable membrane tubules, full-length amphiphysin and FCHo1 destabilized these tubules, leading to highly efficient membrane fission. These results challenge the paradigm that BAR scaffolds stabilize membrane tubes, and suggest instead that they act as templates that locally amplify steric pressure among disordered domains, leading to membrane fission.\n\nAmphiphysin is composed of an N-terminal, amphipathic helix BAR (N-BAR) domain, followed by an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) domain of approximately 383 amino acids in humans, and a C-terminal SH3 domain (Miele et al., 2004; Owen et al., 2004; Owen et al., 1998; Peter et al., 2004) (Fig. 1A) . To compare membrane bending by fulllength amphiphysin (Amph-FL) to the N-BAR domain alone, we first examined the effects of each protein on giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). These experiments revealed that both the N-BAR domain and Amph-FL drove potent membrane bending, forming mobile, diffraction-limited tubules that extended from the GUV surface (Fig. S1A , Movies S1 and S2). These GUVs often collapsed or broke apart into smaller tubules and fragments (Movies S3 and S4), suggesting that lipid tubule formation may not have been the endpoint of the membrane remodeling process.\n\nTo directly visualize the morphology of membranes at the end of remodeling, we utilized negative stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to resolve membrane structures below the optical diffraction limit. As expected from previous findings (Gallop et al., 2006; Peter et al., 2004) , the N-BAR domain transformed vesicles that had an average initial diameter of 200 nm into long tubules with average outer diameter 44\u00b16 nm s.d. (Fig. 1B ,C and S1B,C). In contrast, Amph-FL did not drive appreciable membrane tubule formation in TEM experiments. Rather, Amph-FL divided the vesicles of initially 200 nm diameter into a population of highly curved vesicles with a peak diameter centered near 22 nm (Fig. 1D,E and S1D). This result suggests that Amph-FL is capable of driving membrane fission, a more energetically demanding process than membrane tubule formation (Campelo et al., 2012) .

P-value: one-tailed, unpaired Student's t-test. Scale bars in (B-D): 500 nm. Zoomed region scale bars: 200 nm. See also Fig. S1 and Movies S1-S4.\n\nTo better understand the ability of amphiphysin to drive membrane fission, we compared N-BAR and Amph-FL in two additional assays of membrane fission. In the first of these experiments, we used supported bilayers with extra membrane reservoir (SUPER templates), which are glass beads surrounded by a low-tension membrane. Exposure of SUPER templates to fission-driving proteins results in measurable membrane release from the beads Pucadyil and Schmid, 2008) . SUPER template experiments revealed that while both N-BAR and Amph-FL drove membrane release in the concentration range of 50-1,000 nM, Amph-FL drove more than twice as much (2.6 to 4.7-fold greater) membrane release at each concentration (Fig. 1F) . Notably, membrane release does not directly imply efficient membrane fission, as both vesicles and lipid tubules can be shed from SUPER templates. Therefore, we next employed a tethered vesicle assay to quantify the distributions of fission vesicle diameters over a range of protein concentrations (Snead et al., 2017) . Specifically, we tethered fluorescent vesicles to a coverslip passivated with PEG and PEG-biotin ( Fig. 2A) . Vesicles in these experiments contained a biotinylated lipid, which facilitated tethering to the substrate via binding to neutravidin. Vesicles also contained the fluorescent lipid Oregon Green 488-DHPE, which we used to quantify the brightness of each vesicle after imaging in confocal fluorescence microscopy (Aguet et al., 2013) (Fig. 2B ). We then converted the resulting distributions of vesicle brightness to approximate distributions of vesicle diameter by calibrating against the initial vesicle diameter distribution measured using dynamic light scattering (see methods).\n\nUsing this assay, we found that Amph-FL in the concentration range of 50-150 nM transformed vesicles with an average initial diameter of 200 nm (Fig. 2B ,C) to a population of high curvature fission products (Fig. 2B ,D) with a median diameter of 22 nm at 150 nM, in agreement with results from TEM ( Fig. 1D ,E). The proportion of vesicles that fell within the high curvature group (diameters below approximately 45 nm) increased with increasing protein concentration, from less than 1% at 50 nM to approximately 38% at 150 nM (Fig. 2F ). In contrast, the N-BAR domain did not drive fission, even at higher protein concentrations (Fig. 2B , E, and F). While lipid tubules were not apparent in tethered vesicle experiments with N-BAR (Fig. 2B ), tubules were observed at micromolar N-BAR concentrations (Fig. S1E) , consistent with the tubules formed in TEM experiments (Fig. 1C) . Notably, higher concentrations of Amph-FL were required to observe fission in TEM experiments compared to tethered vesicle experiments. This increase is due to the high lipid concentration used in TEM experiments (approximately 100-fold greater than tethered vesicle experiments), which is necessary to achieve an adequate density of lipid structures for TEM (see methods). Taken together, our results from electron microscopy and tethered vesicle experiments confirm that Amph-FL is a potent driver of membrane fission, while the isolated N-BAR domain is only capable of forming membrane tubules. Full-length amphiphysin produces highly curved fission products. Tethered vesicle composition: 76 mol% DOPC, 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , 15 mol% DOPS, 2 mol% Oregon Green 488-DHPE, 2 mol% DP-EG10-biotin.

FCS experiments also showed that the size of Amph CTD \u2206SH3 varied with the concentration of monovalent salt in the buffer (Fig. S2J) , consistent with the known sensitivity of highly-charged disordered proteins to changes in ionic strength (Srinivasan et al., 2014) . We next performed tethered vesicle experiments to assess membrane fission by Amph CTD \u2206SH3. The protein included an N-terminal hexa-histidine (6his) tag to facilitate binding to membranes by the lipid DOGS-NTA-Ni (Fig. 3A) . Experiments revealed that Amph CTD \u2206SH3 indeed drove the formation of highly curved fission products (Fig. 3B,C) . However, 100-fold greater concentration of Amph CTD \u2206SH3 in solution (10 \u00b5M) was required to generate fission products of similar curvature to those observed with Amph-FL (100 nM) (see Fig. 2D ,F).\n\nMembrane binding experiments with fluorescently-labeled Amph CTD \u2206SH3 showed that when 10 \u00b5M of protein was present in solution, the protein covered approximately 40% of the membrane surface . At this coverage, steric pressure from protein crowding is expected to be sufficient to overcome the energetic barrier to membrane fission (Snead et al., 2017) . Therefore, the requirement for a high solution concentration of Amph CTD \u2206SH3 reflects the conditions necessary to promote crowded binding to the membrane surface. In contrast, the ability of Amph-FL to drive fission at much lower concentrations likely arises from polymerization of the BAR domain scaffold, which enables multivalent membrane binding (Simunovic et al., 2016; Sorre et al., 2012) . In line with this thinking, we found that 100 nM Amph-FL, a concentration which drove potent fission (Fig. 2D ,F), covered greater than 70% of the membrane surface (Fig. S2F ). This coverage is significantly higher than has been observed for non-assembling proteins (Feder, 1980; Snead et al., 2017) . Collectively, these results suggest that the ability of amphiphysin to drive efficient membrane fission arises from a collaboration between its N-BAR domain and disordered domain. respectively) as well as hydrodynamic radius . Tethered vesicle fission experiments revealed that N-BAR-epsin CTD generated highly curved fission products from vesicles with an initial average diameter of 200 nm within a similar range of protein concentrations to Amph-FL (Fig. 3F , compare to Fig. 2D ). Further, both N-BAR-epsin CTD and Amph-FL produced a very similar fraction of fission products with diameters below 45 nm at equivalent concentrations in solution (Fig. 3G) . Finally, SUPER template membrane shedding experiments revealed that in the concentration range of 50-1,000 nM, N-BAR-epsin CTD drove greater membrane release compared to the isolated N-BAR domain (Fig. 3H) , similar to the results of SUPER template experiments comparing N-BAR and Amph-FL (Fig. 1F ). These findings illustrate the ability of N-BAR scaffolds to promote membrane fission by crowding arbitrary disordered domains at membrane surfaces.\n\nHow does crowding among disordered domains overcome the ability of BAR scaffolds to stabilize lipid tubules? One explanation is that steric pressure among the bulky disordered domains of Amph-FL inhibits the assembly of a long-range N-BAR scaffold, which, if allowed to form, would inhibit fission. In support of this hypothesis, when Amph-FL reached over 70% surface coverage as described above (Fig. S2F) , the underlying N-BAR domain covered only about 16% of the membrane, based on membrane footprints for Amph-FL and N-BAR of 79 and 16.5 nm 2 per monomer, respectively (see methods). This coverage is significantly lower than expected for a fully-assembled N-BAR scaffold, which approaches complete coverage (Adam et al., 2015; . Furthermore, the volume available per amphiphysin disordered domain above the N-BAR scaffold is only about 50% of the volume that each domain would be expected to occupy in solution, based on its radius of gyration (Fig. 3I , see calculation in methods). Therefore, the disordered domains would be required to compress substantially to fit around a fullyassembled N-BAR scaffold. Previous work has shown that substantial compression of disordered domains is energetically costly, likely exceeding the cost of membrane deformation . Collectively, these arguments suggest that the presence of amphiphysin's bulky disordered domains inhibits assembly of long-range N-BAR scaffolds.\n\nInterestingly, previous structural studies using cryo-electron microscopy have reported limited observations of tubular N-BAR scaffolds formed from full-length amphiphysin (Adam et al., 2015; . These structures have been observed on membrane substrates containing a majority of negatively-charged lipids, which are thought to provide a strong electrostatic driving force for scaffold assembly (Adam et al., 2015; . Therefore, we performed tethered vesicle fission experiments using a similar membrane composition (Fig. S3) . Here, the onset of membrane fission occurred at somewhat higher Amph-FL concentration, 350 nM ( Fig. S3 ) in comparison to 75 nM ( Fig.  2B -F). These results demonstrate that high concentrations of negatively charged lipids cannot prevent membrane fission as protein concentration increases. Indeed, the cryoelectron microscopy studies cited above suggest that long-range scaffolds assembled from full-length protein were more rare . Moreover, these studies employed buffers that lacked small monovalent ions (Adam et al., 2015; , conditions known to favor extension of disordered domains owing to reduced electrostatic screening (Srinivasan et al., 2014) . This environment likely enabled the disordered domains to pack more efficiently around the scaffold, in line with the needle-like densities seen protruding from the N-BAR scaffold (Adam et al., 2015) .\n\nAll rights reserved.

The disordered domain of amphiphysin alone drives membrane fission, but the N-BAR scaffold substantially enhances fission efficiency. Membrane composition in Amph CTD \u2206SH3 tethered vesicle experiments: 76 mol% DOPC, 20 mol% DOGS-NTA-Ni, 2 mol% Oregon Green 488-DHPE, 2 mol% DP-EG10-biotin. In tethered vesicle experiments with N-BAR-epsin CTD, DOGS-NTA-Ni was replaced with 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 and 15 mol% DOPS. SUPER template membrane composition: 79 mol% DOPC, 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , 15 mol% DOPS, 1 mol% Texas Red-DHPE. \n\nWe next sought to evaluate the influence of disordered domains on the membrane remodeling behavior of BAR domains in live mammalian cells. Multiple previous studies have established that overexpression of BAR domains leads to formation of lipid tubules in the cytosol that are coated by BAR scaffolds (Boucrot et al., 2012; Frost et al., 2008; McDonald et al., 2015; Peter et al., 2004) . We first replicated these findings by overexpressing the N-BAR domain of human amphiphysin tagged with mCherry ( Fig. 4A ) in retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells. We found that N-BAR generated a dense network of tubules inside the cells (Fig. 4B ), in agreement with previous findings (Peter et al., 2004) . The number of tubules per cell increased with the expression level of N-BAR (Fig. 4C) , and co-localized with a plasma membrane stain (Fig. S4A) , indicating that many of the tubules originated from the plasma membrane as previously observed (McDonald et al., 2015; McDonald et al., 2016) . In contrast, overexpression of Amph-FL tagged with mCherry ( Fig. 4A ) led to significantly fewer tubules per cell compared to N-BAR ( Fig. 4 B-D), suggesting that the disordered domain of Amph-FL inhibited tubule formation. Notably, Amph-FL interacts with the clathrin adaptor network and may therefore recruit other membrane remodeling proteins. As such, it is unclear whether the lack of stable All rights reserved.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we created a chimera of N-BAR fused to an alternative disordered domain, from the neuronal protein neurofilament-M (N-BAR-NfM CTD), tagged with mCherry (Fig. 4A) . The disordered C-terminal domain of neurofilament-M acts as an entropic brush, radiating outward along the length of neurofilaments and sterically repelling neighboring disordered domains to control axon diameter (Brown and Hoh, 1997; Kumar et al., 2002) . The neurofilament-M disordered domain is similar in length to that of amphiphysin (438 versus 383 amino acids, respectively) but is not involved in endocytosis and therefore contains no binding domains for endocytic proteins. Overexpressing N-BAR-NfM CTD in RPE cells resulted in a similar phenotype to Amph-FL, in which the number of tubules per cell was significantly reduced compared to the isolated N-BAR domain (Fig. 4 B-D) . Furthermore, while tubules in N-BAR-expressing cells had an average length of 6.0\u00b10.2 \u00b5m s.e.m., tubule lengths in cells expressing Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD were significantly shorter, 3.5\u00b10.1 and 3.6\u00b10.1 \u00b5m s.e.m., respectively (Fig. 4E ).\n\nTime-lapse imaging of live cells revealed that the tubules formed by Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD were more transient in comparison to isolated N-BAR ( Fig. 4F and Movie S5). Specifically, the tubules in cells expressing N-BAR had an average lifetime of approximately 75\u00b15 s s.e.m., whereas tubule lifetime was significantly shorter in cells expressing Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD, approximately 29\u00b13 and 35\u00b14 s s.e.m., respectively (Fig. 4F ). The tubules formed by N-BAR also had greater fluorescence intensity in the protein channel relative to the local background in comparison to Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD (Fig. S4B ,C). This finding indicates that the disordered domains of Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD did not promote tubule fission by enhancing protein binding to the membrane surface. Collectively, results from experiments in live cells indicate that bulky disordered domains are capable of disrupting the formation of stable tubules scaffolded by BAR domains, similar to observations in vitro ( Fig. 1C ,D). The disordered domains may have inhibited tubule formation by driving membrane fission, though future work is needed to test the role of disordered domains in physiological fission events.\n\nAll rights reserved.

To make this comparison, we created a chimeric protein that places the two mechanisms in direct competition within the same molecule. Specifically, we fused the inverted BAR (I-BAR) domain of human IRSp53 to the bulky, C-terminal disordered domain of rat AP180 (569 disordered amino acids) to form I-BAR-AP180 CTD (Fig. 5A ). While the I-BAR domain is known to generate inverted membrane curvature (Mattila et al., 2007; Saarikangas et al., 2009) , the attached disordered domains should generate steric pressure that will tend to bend the membrane in the opposite direction. Exposing GUVs to the I-BAR domain alone drove inverted membrane tubulation, as expected (Fig. 5B , left and Movie S6). In contrast, the I-BAR-AP180 CTD chimera drove neither inward nor outward tubulation. Instead, the protein caused the GUV membrane to fluctuate dynamically through non-spherical shapes in which regions of gentle membrane curvature extending both inward and outward were apparent, (Fig. 5B , right and Movie S7). These \"frustrated\" fluctuations demonstrate that the disordered domain effectively neutralized the ability of the I-BAR domain to drive inward membrane bending. This result suggests that crowding among disordered domains and scaffolding by BAR domains make comparable contributions to membrane remodeling.\n\nMembrane release experiments using SUPER templates showed that exposure to the I-BAR domain (100 nM -5 \u00b5M) decreased the amount of membrane shedding to levels lower than the amount of non-specific shedding that occurred in protein-free buffer (Fig.  5C , negative values). This result suggests that assembly of the I-BAR scaffold stabilized the membrane against shedding. In contrast, I-BAR-AP180 CTD drove positive membrane release at all concentrations ( Fig. 5C) , demonstrating that the disordered domain of AP180 is capable of disrupting the membrane-stabilizing effect of I-BAR. Interestingly, tethered vesicle fission experiments revealed that the highest concentration All rights reserved.

This result demonstrates that, under appropriate conditions, steric pressure among crowded disordered domains is sufficient to overcome the structure-based curvature preference of the I-BAR scaffold. Importantly, while wild-type IRSp53 does not naturally contain a large disordered domain, the I-BAR domain-containing proteins MIM and ABBA do contain regions of substantial disorder (approximately 475 amino acids in MIM) (Lee et al., 2007) . Therefore, our observations raise the question of whether the presumed role of these proteins in driving cellular membrane protrusions can be justified on the basis of in vitro studies of their isolated I-BAR domains (Mattila et al., 2007; Saarikangas et al., 2009 ).\n\nIf BAR scaffolds drive membrane fission by concentrating large disordered domains at membrane surfaces, then the ability of Amph-FL to drive fission (Figs. 1 and 2) should extend to other proteins that contain both BAR domains and substantial regions of intrinsic disorder. Interestingly, many proteins that contain the modestly-curved F-BAR domain also have this architecture (Roberts-Galbraith and Gould, 2010), including the endocytic proteins FCHo1/2 (Henne et al., 2010) and its yeast homolog Syp1 (Reider et al., 2009) , the srGAP proteins involved in neuronal development (Wuertenberger and Groemping, 2015) , and the cytokinesis proteins Cdc15 and Imp2 (McDonald et al., 2016) in S. pombe and Hof1 (Meitinger et al., 2011) in S. cerevisiae. To test this idea, we examined FCHo1 (C. elegans), which consists of an Nterminal F-BAR domain followed by an intrinsically disordered domain of 412 amino acids and a C-terminal \u00b5-homology domain (Henne et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2016; Umasankar et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016) (Fig. 5E ). Negative stain TEM revealed that exposure of vesicles with an initial average diameter of 200 nm to the F-BAR domain of FCHo1 drove formation of lipid tubules with an average diameter of 21\u00b12 nm s.d. (Fig. 5F ,G and S5A,B), in agreement with previous findings (Henne et al., 2010; Henne et al., 2007) . In contrast, full-length FCHo1 (FCHo1-FL) did not generate lipid tubules, but instead divided the 200 nm diameter vesicles into a population of highly curved vesicles with average diameter 17\u00b17 nm s.d. (Fig. 5H and S5C,D) .\n\nSimilarly, tethered vesicle fission experiments revealed that FCHo1-FL drove potent membrane fission over the concentration range of 10-250 nM (Fig. 5I,K) , a comparable range to Amph-FL (50-150 nM, Fig. 2D ,F), with a mean diameter of 19\u00b11 nm s.e.m. at 250 nM of FCHo1-FL. However, the F-BAR domain alone did not drive fission in these experiments, even at substantially higher concentrations up to 2 \u00b5M (Fig. 5J,K) . Interestingly, in both tethered vesicle and TEM experiments, the fission products produced by FCHo1-FL had a peak diameter of slightly less than 20 nm, with some vesicles as small as 10 nm. These small diameters suggest that FCHo1-FL may stabilize All rights reserved.

Notably, vesicles in these experiments were composed primarily of the lipid DOPC, which has a lower bending rigidity than physiological membranes (Dimova, 2014) . In contrast, when we increased bilayer rigidity by replacing DOPC with the substantially more rigid, fully-saturated lipid DPPC (Dimova, 2014; Lee et al., 2001) , the average diameter of fission products increased to approximately 50 nm at 50 nM of FCHo1-FL, consistent with bilayer vesicles (Fig. S5E-G) . Collectively, these studies show that, despite their gentle curvature, F-BAR scaffolds are also capable of collaborating with disordered domain crowding to drive efficient membrane fission, producing highly curved vesicles. These findings suggest that the ability of BAR domains to assemble into scaffolds that concentrate disordered domains, regardless of their intrinsic structural curvature, is the key requirement for membrane fission.\n\nAll rights reserved.

By highlighting the ability of BAR scaffolds to locally concentrate disordered domains, this work helps to explain how steric pressure can be generated and locally sustained at membrane surfaces. Further, our findings are in contrast with the established view that BAR scaffolds prevent fission by stabilizing membrane tubes (Boucrot et al., 2012) . Instead, our work suggests that BAR proteins that contain substantial disordered regions are more likely to be drivers of membrane fission. In support of this idea, previous work showed that the yeast amphiphysins Rvs161/167 are essential for membrane fission, and deletion of these proteins leads to a defect in the entry of clathrin-coated pits into cells (Kaksonen et al., 2005; Kishimoto et al., 2011) . Depletion of amphiphysin by RNA interference also dramatically inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells (Meinecke et al., 2013) , although this endocytic defect has been attributed to a reduction in dynamin recruitment.\n\nOur finding that modestly-curved F-BAR domains can also collaborate with bulky disordered domains to drive potent fission is surprising, as it suggests that proteins such as FCHo1/2 may participate in membrane shaping throughout the maturation of clathrincoated pits, and may even help drive the final fission event. This hypothesis is in contrast to the idea that FCHo1/2 are primarily involved in the initiation of clathrin-coated pits All rights reserved.

However, previous work showed that FCHo2 is present throughout the lifetime of clathrin-coated pits (Taylor et al., 2011) , supporting the possible role of FCHo2 in membrane shaping. Moreover, many F-BAR proteins involved in other cellular pathways such as cytokinesis also contain large regions of intrinsic disorder (McDonald et al., 2016; Meitinger et al., 2011; . As such, our findings raise the question of whether F-BAR scaffolds facilitate membrane fission in a variety of contexts beyond membrane traffic.\n\nMore broadly, our work raises the possibility that protein assemblies beyond BAR domains may serve as scaffolds for crowding bulky disordered domains in order to ensure efficient membrane fission. One potential example is dynamin, a scaffold-forming GTPase involved in fission of clathrin-coated pits (Antonny et al., 2016) . While dynamin itself does not contain substantial regions of disorder, it assembles with proteins that contain such domains, including amphiphysin and SNX9 (Daumke et al., 2014) . Once recruited by dynamin, these proteins may generate significant steric pressure at membrane necks. In line with this thinking, previous in vitro studies found that amphiphysin acts synergistically with dynamin to enhance membrane fission (Meinecke et al., 2013; . Moreover, the yeast dynamin homolog, Vps1, is dispensable for fission, but is necessary for proper localization and accumulation of amphiphysin at clathrincoated pits (Kaksonen et al., 2005; Smaczynska-de Rooij et al., 2010) . A function of Vps1 could therefore be to organize and concentrate bulky disordered domains at membrane necks to promote fission.\n\nRecent work has revealed that BAR domains also promote membrane fission by acting as a diffusion barrier to lipids (Renard et al., 2015; Simunovic et al., 2017) . This \"frictiondriven scission\" mechanism may be responsible for fission in a clathrin-independent endocytic pathway (Renard et al., 2015; Simunovic et al., 2017) . While friction-driven scission and disordered domain crowding are distinct mechanisms, they are not mutually exclusive and may therefore work cooperatively to drive fission of endocytic structures. Future work is needed to better understand the potential collaboration between these BAR domain-mediated fission mechanisms.\n\nOur work reveals a synergistic relationship between structured protein assemblies and disordered pressure generators, which can be harnessed to drive membrane fission. It is increasingly recognized that structural disorder is prevalent in membrane trafficking, and that disordered domains are often coupled to structured domains within the same protein molecules (Pietrosemoli et al., 2013) . While previous work has focused primarily on structure-function relationships revealed by studying individual protein domains, these findings highlight the importance of examining the collective contributions from both All rights reserved.

Full-length human amphiphysin (residues 1-695) was cloned into the pCAGEN vector, in frame with mCherry at the C-terminus, by first excising the N-BAR domain from the template using EcoRI and AgeI restriction sites, and then ligating in full-length amphiphysin using the same EcoRI and AgeI restriction sites. The N-BAR domain of human amphiphysin fused to the C-terminal domain of mouse neurofilament-M (N-BAR-NfM CTD, residues 411-848 of mouse neurofilament-M) was cloned by ligating neurofilament-M CTD into the existing N-BAR-mCherry pCAGEN template, between N-BAR and mCherry, using a single AgeI restriction site.

All plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing.\n\nAll proteins were expressed as N-terminal glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion constructs in BL21 E. coli cells following induction with 1 mM IPTG. Full-length amphiphysin, N-BAR, Amph CTD \u2206SH3, I-BAR, I-BAR-AP180 CTD and F-BAR were induced at 30 \u00b0C for 6-8 h. N-BAR-epsin CTD was induced at 16 \u00b0C for 20 h. Full-length FCHo1 was induced at 12 \u00b0C for 24 h. Cells were harvested and bacteria were lysed using lysis buffer and probe sonication. For full-length FCHo1, lysis buffer was: 100 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 1% Triton X-100, 1x Roche protease inhibitor cocktail. For all other proteins, lysis buffer was: 500 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol or 5 mM TCEP, 5% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 1% Triton X-100, 1x Roche or Pierce protease inhibitor cocktail. Proteins were purified from bacterial extracts by incubating with glutathione resin, followed by extensive washing (at least 10x column volumes). Full-length amphiphysin, N-BAR, Amph CTD \u2206SH3, and F-BAR were cleaved directly from the resin using soluble HRV-3C (Thermo Fisher) or thrombin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) proteases overnight at 4 \u00b0C with rocking. HRV-3C, which contained a GST tag, was removed by passage through a glutathione agarose column. Thrombin was removed with p-aminobenzamidine-agarose resin (Sigma-Aldrich). N-BAR-epsin CTD, I-BAR, and I-BAR-AP180 CTD were eluted with 15 mM reduced glutathione in 500 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM \u03b2mercaptoethanol or 5 mM TCEP, 5% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF buffer. Full-length FCHo1 was eluted with 15 mM reduced glutathione in 100 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF buffer. The proteins were concentrated with EMD Millipore Amicon centrifugal filter units, desalted with Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (Fisher), and then incubated with either Thrombin CleanCleave Kit (Sigma-Aldrich), soluble HRV-3C, or soluble thrombin overnight at 4 \u00b0C with rocking. Cleaved GST was removed by passage through a glutathione agarose column. I-BAR-AP180 CTD and N-BAR-epsin CTD were further purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superose 6 column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM DTT. All proteins were stored as small aliquots or liquid nitrogen pellets at -80 \u00b0C.\n\nProteins were labeled using amine-reactive, NHS ester-functionalized dyes (Atto-Tec) in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.35, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM TCEP buffer. The concentration of dye was adjusted experimentally to obtain the desired labeling ratio of 0.5-1 dye molecules per protein, typically 2-5 times molar excess of dye. Reactions were performed for 20-30 min at room temperature and labeled protein was separated from unconjugated dye using Princeton CentriSpin-20 size exclusion spin columns (Princeton Separations).\n\nVesicles for electron microscopy were composed of 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , 15 mol% DOPS, and 80 mol% DOPC. Dried lipid films were hydrated in 20 mM MOPS pH 7.35, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EGTA and EDTA buffer and extruded though a 200 nm pore filter (Whatman). Proteins were diluted to the indicated concentrations in the same MOPS buffer with 5 mM TCEP and incubated with vesicles at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min (Amph-FL and N-BAR) or 60 min (FCHo1-FL and F-BAR). The vesicle concentration was 1 mM in experiments with Amph-FL, FCHo1-FL, and F-BAR, and 0.1 mM in experiments with N-BAR and in protein-free controls. 5 \u00b5L of the mixture was placed onto a glow-discharged, 300 square mesh, carbon-coated grid and stained with 2% uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences; Hatfield, PA, USA). Images were collected on a Tecnai Spirit BioTwin T12 electron microscope (Tecnai; Hillsboro, OR, USA). Vesicle and tubule diameters were measured using ImageJ software. All rights reserved.

Laser wavelengths of 488 and 561 nm were used for excitation. Emission filters were centered at 525 nm with a 50 nm width, and 629 nm with a 62 nm width. A triple-pass dichroic mirror was used: 405/488/561 nm. The microscope objective was a Plan-Apochromat 100x, 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective. Images were collected on a cooled (-70 \u00b0C) EMCCD iXon3 897 camera (Andor Technology; Belfast, UK).\n\nGiant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) were prepared according to published protocols (Angelova and Dimitrov, 1986) . A mixture of 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , 15 mol% DOPS, 0.5 mol% Oregon Green 488-DHPE, and 79.5 mol% DOPC was dried into a film on an indium-tin-oxide coated glass slide. Lipids were further dried under vacuum overnight. Electroformation was performed at 55 \u00b0C in 350 mOsm sucrose solution also containing 0.5 mM EGTA and EDTA to prevent clustering of PtdIns(4,5)P 2 . Vesicles were mixed with protein solution at the specified concentration in 20 mM MOPS pH 7.35, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EGTA and EDTA, 5 mM TCEP buffer. Prior to mixing, the osmolarity of the GUV solution and experiment buffer was measured using a vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor).\n\nSUPER templates were prepared according to the protocol of Neumann et al . A lipid mixture of 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , 15 mol% DOPS, 1 mol% Texas Red DHPE, and 79 mol% DOPC was mixed in a clean glass test tube, the solvent was evaporated, and the lipid film was further dried under vacuum. The lipid film was hydrated in Milli-Q water, subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen, and extruded through a 100 nm pore filter (Whatman). SUPER templates were made by creating a 100 \u00b5L mixture consisting of 200 \u00b5M liposomes, 1 M NaCl, and 5 x 10 6 of 2.5 \u00b5m m-type silica beads (Corpuscular; Cold Spring, NY, USA) in a low-adhesion microcentrifuge tube. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and gently agitated periodically. The mixture was washed by adding 1 mL Milli-Q water, gently mixing, and spinning at 300 g for 2 min in a swinging bucket rotor to pellet the SUPER templates. 1 mL of supernatant was removed, SUPER templates were resuspended in the remaining 100 \u00b5L, and washing was repeated a total of four times. SUPER templates were kept on ice and used within 4 h. All rights reserved.

SUPER templates were allowed to slowly settle for 30 min at room temperature without disturbing. SUPER templates containing unreleased membrane were then sedimented by gentle centrifugation at 300 g for 2 min in a swinging bucket rotor. 75 \u00b5L of supernatant containing released membrane was collected and mixed in a 96-well plate with Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 0.1% and volume of 100 \u00b5L. In order to measure the total fluorescence of SUPER template membrane, a detergent control consisting of SUPER templates added directly to 0.1% Triton X-100, which solubilized all SUPER template membrane, was run. The fluorescence intensity of released membrane was measured in a plate reader using 590 nm excitation light and an emission filter centered at 620 nm. After subtracting the fluorescence of 0.1% Triton X-100 in buffer alone from all measurements, membrane release was calculated by dividing the fluorescence intensity after protein exposure by the fluorescence intensity of the detergent control. The background level of membrane release in the absence of protein was also measured by incubating SUPER templates in buffer alone. This buffer control was subtracted from all measurements as background.\n\nImaging wells for fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) utilized supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) to passivate the glass surface and prevent protein adsorption. Briefly, a well was created with a silicone gasket on an ultraclean coverslip, and a solution of sonicated DOPC vesicles at 1 mM lipid was added. The SLB was formed for 10 min and thoroughly washed in experiment buffer of 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM CaCl 2 , 150 mm NaCl, 15 mM EGTA, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM TCEP. Atto 488-labeled proteins were diluted in experiment buffer and added to the imaging well such that the concentration of Atto 488 dye was approximately 1 nM. FCS measurements were acquired on a custom-built timecorrelated single photon counting confocal microscope using a 486 nm picosecond pulsed diode laser. The laser was focused in solution approximately 3 \u00b5m above the bilayer passivation surface, and fluorescence signal was collected as proteins diffused through the focused laser volume. The signal was split onto separate GaAsP photomultiplier tubes (Hamamatsu) for cross-correlation using Becker and Hickl software. FCS traces were collected for 120 s. The number of FCS traces acquired for Amph CTD \u2206SH3, AP180 CTD, and transferrin were: 10, 5, and 3, respectively. Each FCS trace was fit with the 2D autocorrelation function: All rights reserved.

Fitting was performed in Wolfram Mathematica 11 software. values were between 0.90 and 0.93 for all fits, demonstrating that a substantial correction for anomalous diffusion was not needed.\n\nFig. S2G-I shows representative FCS traces and fits for Amph CTD \u2206SH3, AP180 CTD, and transferrin, with mean values of / \u00b1 first s.d. reported next to each trace. The hydrodynamic radius, 6 , of each protein is also reported next to each trace. AP180 CTD was used as a calibration standard to compute 6 of Amph CTD \u2206SH3 , as / is directly proportional to 6 . AP180 CTD is a disordered protein with a radius that has been wellcharacterized Kalthoff et al., 2002) , making it an appropriate calibration standard. This calibration approach also yielded a radius for transferrin that was consistent with its expected radius (Hall et al., 2002) , confirming the validity of our approach. The radius of Amph CTD \u2206SH3 was taken as 5 nm in estimates of membrane coverage by proteins in Fig. 3D , S2A-F, and S2K-M. This value was chosen based on previous studies which found that the radius of gyration of a disordered protein is approximately 1.2-fold greater than the hydrodynamic radius (Hofmann et al., 2012; Sherman and Haran, 2006 ). (Zhang and Han, 1996) . Because / is directly proportional to 6 , the increase in / at 10 mM NaCl indicates an increase in 6 , likely owing to reduced charge screening which expands and extends the disordered protein (Srinivasan et al., 2014) . Similarly, the decrease in / at 1 M NaCl indicates a decrease in 6 , owing to enhanced charge screening which compacts the disordered protein.\n\nfor 10-15 min to dissolve the PEG. Acetic acid was added to a concentration of 1%, and 50 \u00b5L of the reactive mixture was dropped onto a dry, ultraclean coverslip. Another dry, ultraclean coverslip was sandwiched on top, and the slides were incubated at 70 \u00b0C for 30-60 min. The slides were separated, washed in ultrapure water, and stored dry for later use. Imaging wells were made by placing silicone gaskets onto the glass and hydrating in 20 mM MOPS pH 7.35, 150 mM NaCl buffer. Neutravidin was added to the well at a final concentration of 0.2 mg mL -1 , incubated for 10 min, and the well was washed repeatedly with MOPS buffer before adding vesicles.\n\nThe biotinylated PLL-PEG was made according to a previous protocol (Ruiz -Taylor et al., 2001) . Briefly, amine-reactive PEG-SVA (succinimidyl valerate) and biotin-PEG-SVA was added to a 40 mg mL -1 mixture of PLL in 50 mM sodium tetraborate pH 8.5 at a molar ratio of one PEG per five lysine subunits. PEG-biotin comprised 2% of the total PEG amount. The mixture was stirred continuously for 6 h at room temperature and buffer exchanged into PBS using Centri-Spin size exclusion columns (Princeton Separations). Imaging wells were made by placing silicone gaskets onto ultraclean coverslips. Wells were coated for 20-30 min with biotinylated PLL-PEG diluted tenfold in 20 mM MOPS pH 7.35, 150 mM NaCl buffer. After coating, the well was washed repeatedly with MOPS buffer to wash out excess PLL-PEG. Neutravidin was added to the well following the same process as for PEG-silane slides.\n\nVesicle diameter distributions were measured using an assay developed by the Stamou group (Hatzakis et al., 2009; Kunding et al., 2008; Stamou et al., 2003) . Vesicles in experiments with Amph-FL, N-BAR, N-BAR-epsin CTD, I-BAR-AP180 CTD, FCHo1-FL, and F-BAR were composed of 76 mol% DOPC, 15 mol% DOPS, 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , 2 mol% DP-EG10-biotin, and 2 mol% Oregon Green 488-DHPE. Vesicles in experiments with Amph CTD \u2206SH3 were composed of a similar lipid mixture, with the exception that DOPS and PtdIns(4,5)P 2 were replaced with 20 mol% DOGS-NTA-Ni. Experiments with Amph-FL and N-BAR on highly charged membranes (Fig. S3 ) used vesicles composed of 68 mol% DOPS, 23 mol% DOPE, 5 mol% cholesterol, 2 mol% DP-EG10-biotin, and 2 mol% Oregon Green 488-DHPE, similar to Mim et al, Cell 2012 . Dried lipid films were hydrated in 20 mM MOPS pH 7.35, 150 mM NaCl buffer (0.5 mM EGTA and EDTA was included in experiments with PtdIns(4,5)P 2 ) and extruded to 200 nm.\n\nFission experiments were performed by mixing vesicles at a concentration of 10 \u00b5M with unlabeled protein at specified concentrations in the above MOPS buffer with 5 mM TCEP. The mixture was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for either 30 min (Amph-FL, N-BAR, Amph CTD \u2206SH3, and N-BAR-epsin CTD) or 60 min (I-BAR-AP180 CTD, FCHo1-FL, and F-BAR).\n\nAll rights reserved.

After incubation, the mixtures were added to the wells and vesicles were allowed to tether for 10 min before washing repeatedly to remove untethered vesicles. Multiple spinning disc confocal z-stacks of tethered vesicles were acquired with a z-step of 0.1 \u00b5m. The same laser power and camera gain settings were used for all experiments.\n\nAll images in the z-stacks were cropped to the center 171x171 pixels (center 1/9 th ), and the frame with the greatest mean brightness was selected as the best focus image for analysis. Fluorescence amplitudes of diffraction-limited puncta were obtained using cmeAnalysis particle detection software (Aguet et al., 2013) . Individual vesicles were detected by fitting two-dimensional Gaussian profiles to each puncta. The standard deviation of the Gaussian was determined from the point spread function of our microscope. The brightness values of detected puncta were reported as valid if they were diffraction-limited and had amplitudes significantly above their local fluorescence background. To further ensure that puncta were well above the noise threshold, we only accepted puncta that persisted at the same location through five consecutive imaging frames.\n\nTo convert fluorescence brightness values to vesicle diameters, we computed a scaling factor that centered the mean of the vesicle brightness distribution of a high-curvature, sonicated vesicle sample to the average diameter of the same vesicles obtained from dynamic light scattering. This scaling factor was then used to scale the vesicle brightness distributions after protein exposure to distributions of vesicle diameter.\n\nVesicles in experiments with full-length amphiphysin and N-BAR were composed of 76 mol% DOPC, 15 mol% DOPS, 5 mol% PtdIns(4,5)P 2 , 2 mol% DP-EG10-biotin, and 2 mol% Oregon Green 488-DHPE. DOPS and PtdIns(4,5)P 2 were replaced with 20 mol% DOGS-NTA-Ni in experiments with Amph CTD \u2206SH3. Dried lipid films were hydrated in 20 mM MOPS pH 7.35, 150 mM NaCl buffer (0.5 mM EGTA and EDTA was included in experiments with PtdIns(4,5)P 2 ) and extruded to 30 or 200 nm. Imaging wells were prepared as described above. Vesicles were diluted to 5 \u00b5M in the wells and allowed to tether for 10 min. Untethered vesicles were removed by thorough washing with MOPS buffer. After tethering, Atto 594-labeled protein was added to the specified concentration, and multiple spinning disc confocal z-stacks of lipid and protein fluorescence were acquired, with a z-step of 0.1 \u00b5m. Images were collected after approximately 15 min incubation of protein with vesicles. The same laser power and camera gain settings were used for all experiments.

Here we only accepted puncta that persisted at the same location through three consecutive imaging frames. The algorithm also searched for fluorescent puncta in the protein channel using the centroids of the detected fluorescent puncta in the master lipid channel. The search region in the protein channel was three times the standard deviation of the Gaussian fit to the point spread function of our microscope. We estimated vesicle diameters from lipid fluorescence brightnesses by calibrating against dynamic light scattering, as described in the previous section. We estimated the number of bound proteins on each vesicle by comparing brightness values in the protein channel to the brightness of a single molecule of Atto 594-labeled protein. Images of single molecules of Atto 594-labeled proteins were obtained by adding a dilute concentration of protein to an imaging well on an ultraclean coverslip, and imaging single proteins adhered to the coverslip surface in a similar manner as described for the tethered vesicles. A linear correction for camera exposure time was applied to the single molecule brightness, as longer exposure times were required to image single molecules compared to membranebound protein. Fig. S2B shows a plot of the raw protein intensity values as a function of vesicle intensity for 10 and 25 nM Amph-FL. The 25 nM data shows a higher slope than 10 nM, indicating greater membrane coverage. Fig. S2C shows this same data after processing, plotted as the number of membrane-bound proteins as a function of vesicle diameter.\n\nMembrane coverage by proteins was estimated for each vesicle by dividing the area occupied by membrane-bound proteins by the corresponding vesicle surface area. The projected membrane footprint of N-BAR, Amph-FL, and Amph CTD \u2206SH3 monomers were assumed to be: 16.5 (Adam et al, Scientific Reports 2015) (Adam et al., 2015) , 79, and 79 nm 2 , respectively. The average membrane coverage within an experiment was estimated as the mean of all individual vesicle coverage values. Experiments were repeated three times for each protein concentration. Fig. S2D ,E and Fig. 3D plots the mean \u00b1 first s.d. of the coverage values from the three experiments. To confirm the validity of this analysis approach, we also plotted the area of membrane-bound proteins as a function of vesicle surface area, as shown in Fig. S2M for the 1 \u00b5M Amph CTD \u2206SH3 dataset. The slope of a linear fit to these data provides an alternative estimate of membrane coverage. The slope of 0.21, or 21% coverage, agrees well with 24% membrane coverage in Fig. 3D that was estimated using the method described above.\n\nAll rights reserved.

At concentrations above 25 nM, Amph-FL significantly deformed and tubulated 200 nm tethered vesicles, leading to inaccuracies in coverage estimates. Therefore, to obtain estimates of membrane coverage by Amph-FL at higher concentrations at which potent fission occurs, we used higher initial curvature vesicles, extruded to 30 nm. Fig. S2F plots membrane coverage by Amph-FL at 25 and 100 nM on 30 nm vesicles, showing that Amph-FL reached approximately 77% membrane coverage at 100 nM, significantly higher than can be reached by protein monomers that do not assemble (Feder, 1980) . This coverage is expected to generate significant steric pressure from disordered domain crowding, thus providing a potential explanation for the strong membrane fission observed with Amph-FL at 100 nM.\n\nA plasmid for expression of BFP-tagged clathrin light chain (BFP-CLC) was generated by replacing the mCherry domain of mCherry-CLC, a gift from Dr. Tom Kirchhausen (Addgene #53972). The mCherry fluorophore was removed and replaced with tagBFP, a gift from Dr. Franck Perez (Addgene #65257). mCherry was excised from the mCherry-CLC plasmid using AgeI and XhoI restriction enzymes. TagBFP was amplified from the li-Str_ManII-SBP-tagBFP plasmid using PCR primers which introduced AgeI and XhoI restriction sites. The resulting tagBFP sequence was digested and ligated onto the CLC backbone to generate BFP-CLC with a linker sequence of HKGRPTR. The CLC-BFP construct was then excised using AgeI and EcoRI restriction sites and ligated into a pLJM1 backbone obtained from Addgene as a gift from Dr. David Sabatini (Addgene #19319). Once subcloned into this viral transfer plasmid, lentiviruses were generated by transfecting the BFP-CLC construct with the envelope plasmid VSVG (a gift from Dr. Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz, Addgene #11912) and packaging plasmid pCMV-dR8.91 (a gift from Dr. Janet Zoldan). Lentiviral particles were then harvested, filtered, and incubated with human retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) recipient cells (ARPE-19, purchased from American Type Culture Collection). Cells were incubated with 2 \u00b5g/mL puromycin for one week to select for transduced cells which were then used to generate the monoclonal cell line stably expressing BFP-CLC.\n\nCell culture and transfection BFP-CLC RPE cells were grown in 1:1 F12:DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 20 mM HEPES, Pen/Strep/L-glutamine (100 units/ml, 100 \u03bcg/ml, 300 \u03bcg/ml respectively) and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . Cells were seeded onto acid washed coverslips at a density of 5 x 10 4 cells per coverslip for 24 hours before transfection with 1-2 \u00b5g of plasmid DNA using 3 \u00b5L Fugene transfection reagent per \u00b5g of DNA (Promega, Madison, WI, All rights reserved.

Cells were imaged 16-20 h after transfection. Two independent transfections were performed for each plasmid construct, and data were pooled from both transfections.\n\nSpinning disc confocal z-stacks of BFP-CLC and the mCherry fusion protein were collected with a z-step of 0.25 \u00b5m. Z-stacks were analyzed for the number of tubes per cell and tube length. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ software. The plasma membrane frame was chosen by identifying the BFP-CLC frame in which the clathrincoated structures were best in focus. The plasma membrane expression level of the mCherry fusion protein was then quantified by measuring the mean brightness on a region of the plasma membrane, away from the nucleus and bright structures. Membrane tubes were counted at one frame above the plasma membrane frame. Tube lengths were quantified as the end-to-end distances of the tubes. Fig. S4A shows an image of a cell stained with CellMask Green plasma membrane stain (Thermo Fisher). Before imaging, the cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 \u00b0C in a solution of the CellMask Green stain diluted 1000-fold in sterile PBS. The solution was removed and the cells were washed three times with media before imaging.\n\nA custom-built TIRF microscope was used to collect time-lapse movies of live cells. A 532 nm laser was used to excite mCherry, and a 635 nm laser was used for autofocus. An Olympus IX73 microscope body was equipped with a Photometrics Evolve Delta EMCCD camera and a Zeiss plan-apochromat 100x 1.46 NA oil immersion TIRF objective. The objective was heated to 37 \u00b0C using a Pecon TempController 2000-2 objective heater. The emission filter for the 532 nm laser was a dual bandpass filter centered at 583 nm with 37 nm width and 707 nm with 51 nm width, which minimized signal from the autofocus laser. Movies were collected at the plasma membrane just above the coverslip surface in 2 s intervals for 120 frames. Tube lifetimes and intensities were quantified from TIRF movies. Only movies of cells with similar expression level, acquired under identical imaging settings, were used for analysis. For the tube lifetime analysis in Fig. 4F , only tubes which appeared within the time course of imaging and departed before the end of the time course were included. For the tube intensity analysis, a single frame in the movie with the maximum number of tubes was selected, and the average tube intensity was measured along a straight line drawn on the tube. The mean intensity along an identical line on either side of the tube was also measured, and these values were averaged to estimate the local background intensity of the tube. The protein enrichment on the tube was then quantified as the ratio of the tube intensity to the local background, after subtracting the camera noise background from both values.\n\nAll rights reserved.

Because Amph-FL occupies a greater area on the membrane surface compared to N-BAR (79 versus 16.5 nm 2 per monomer, respectively), Amph-FL reaches a higher coverage than N-BAR at equal number density of membranebound proteins. At 25 nM, Amph-FL reaches approximately 20% membrane coverage, approaching a crowded regime (Snead et al., 2017; Stachowiak et al., 2012) . Markers in (D) and (E) represent mean \u00b1 first s.d., n = 3 independent experiments. (F) Membrane coverage estimates for 25 and 100 nM Amph-FL on 30 nm vesicles. At 100 nM Amph-FL, when potent membrane fission occurs, Amph-FL reaches approximately 77% membrane coverage, significantly higher than can be reached by non-assembling proteins. At this coverage, steric pressure from disordered domain crowding is very high, providing a potential explanation for strong membrane fission by Amph-FL. Markers indicate mean of all coverage values, error bars represent 95% confidence interval. 25 nM: n = 2,171 vesicles, 100 nM: n = 1,783 vesicles.

Average values of diffusion time, t D , \u00b1 first s.d. are shown next to each trace, with n = 10, 5, and 3 FCS traces for Amph CTD \u2206SH3, AP180 CTD, and transferrin, respectively. The hydrodynamic radius, 6 , of each protein is also shown next to each trace. 6 of Amph CTD \u2206SH3 was computed by scaling from the known 6 of AP180 CTD (see methods). Using this same approach yields an 6 of transferrin that is similar to its expected value (Hall et al., 2002) . (J) Relative diffusion times of Amph CTD \u2206SH3 in buffer with 10, 150, and 1,000 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), expressed as the proportion of the average diffusion time at 150 mM NaCl. The data indicate a transition from an extended to a more compact state with increasing ionic strength, as expected for charged disordered proteins (Srinivasan et al., 2014) . Diffusion times were corrected for changes in solution viscosity with varying NaCl concentration (Zhang and Han, 1996) .

The slope of a linear fit to the data represents the average membrane coverage by proteins. The value of 21% coverage from this approach agrees with 24% membrane coverage shown in Fig. 3D , estimated by averaging all of the membrane coverage values of individual vesicles.
