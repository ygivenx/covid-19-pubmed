{"title": "Characterization of the Specificity and Genetic Restriction of Human CD4+ Cytotoxic T Cell Clones Reactive to Capsid Antigen of Rubella Virus", "body": "o 1992 Academic press. ~nc.\n\nRubella virus (RV) is a common human pathogen. RV infections during pregnancy may result in spontaneous abortion and congenital defects or viral persistence in newborns (Sandra et al., 1985) . Several live, attenuated rubella vaccines have been introduced since 1969 ( Pet-fins, 1985) . Immunization of infants and susceptible women of child-bearing age against RV is now a standard public health measure. However, there are still major medical concerns: the reinfection of vaccinees by wild-type RV and the risk of both congenital infection of the fetus and rubella-associated arthritis arising from vaccination (Chantler et a/., 1982; Fraser et a/., 1983; Sandra et a/., 1985) . There is a clear requirement for the development of a noninfectious rubella vaccine. Recent studies indicate that synthetic peptides can function as inexpensive and noninfectious candidate vaccines against infectious diseases (Milich, 1988) .\n\nIt is important to know the major human T cell sites when selecting short synthetic peptides as components of potential subunit vaccines. Evidence from many virus studies has indicated a central role for CD4+ rather than CD8+ T cells in the induction of specific immune responses to virus antigens such as subunit peptides (Good et al., 1988; Korner et a/., 1991; Fayolle et a/., 1991) . It is known that CD4+ T cells rec- ' To whom reprint requests should be addressed ognize foreign antigens (Ag) not in their native form but as small peptides that are produced from processed Ag within Ag-presenting cells (APCs) and presented at the cell surface as a complex with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules (Milich et al., 1987; Berzofsky, 1989) . Thus, identifying these small peptide epitopes within the primary sequence of a candidate vaccine Ag and defining their genetic restriction of recognization by T lymphocytes could facilitate effective vaccine design (Milich et a/., 1987; Wallace et al., 1991) .\n\nRV is an enveloped RNA virus with two envelope glycoproteins (El and E2) on the virion surface and a capsid protein in the RNA core (Oker-Blom et al., 1983) . We have synthesized 49 synthetic peptides comprising approximately 95% of the amino acid sequences of the structural proteins El (23 peptides), E2 (15 peptides), and C (1 1 peptides) of RV strain M33 (Clarke et a/., 1987) and initiated a series of experiments to search for peptide-specific T cell responses in individuals naturally infected with RV. We have showed that C peptides such as C5 (residues 96-l 23), C6 (residues 119-152), C9 (residues 205-233) or Cl 1 (residues 255-280) can induce significant proliferation of T cells in short-term cultured T cell lines from some RV-seropositive donors (Ou et a/., 1992) . The T cell clones used in this study were initially established from the T cell lines of two RV seropositive donors (Ou et a/., 1992) . A total of 36 clones were isolated by the method a A total of 2 X 1 O4 T cells from each clone was tested for their proliferative response to each synthetrc peptide at a final concentration of 5 pg/ml in the presence of y-irradiated (3000 rad) autologous PBMC 5 X 1 O4 as APC. Results are presented as the mean cpm obtained from triplicate determinations.\n\n' Underlined numbers represent significant cell proliferation values of limiting dilution (Celis et al., 1988a,b) and their RV specificity was tested in proliferation assays (Ou et al., 1992) . To further identify the capacity of these T cell clones to recognize the T cell epitopes of the structural proteins of RV, their responses to 49 synthetic peptides were tested in proliferation assays. Based on their positive responses to both UV-inactivated RV and individual C peptides, 7 clones were selected for this study. T cell clones (Rl 0, Rl 1, and R18) isolated from an oriental donor (RM) reacted strongly only with peptide C6 (residues 1 19-l 52) (Table 1) . T cell clones A2, Al 0, Al 1, and Al 2 were isolated from a Caucasian donor (AT). Clones A2 and Al 1 responded to C9 (residues 205-233) while clones A10 and Al 2 reacted with Cl 1 (residues 255-280) ( Table 1) . Surface marker analysis of all T cell clones showed that more than 99% of cells were CD3+, CD4+, and CD8-cells (data not shown), demonstrating that these T cell clones are probably T helper cells.\n\nterminants. Target cells that were incubated with medium alone or with UV-inactivated EBV or other peptides of RV were not killed by these T cells or were only marginally lysed in a dose-independent manner (data not shown), indicating that the cytotoxic responses were indeed Ag-specific.\n\nThe cytotoxic activities of capsid peptide-specific T cell clones were studied by using autologous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell line (EBV-BL) cells as targets in a standard 5'Cr release assays (Celis et al,, 1988a) . Strong and specific cytotoxic responses of T cell clones Rl 1, R18, A2, AlO, Al 1, and Al2 were observed when target cells were preincubated with either RV or peptides C6, C9, or Cl 1, respectively (Fig.  1) . The results indicated that T cell clones Rl 1 and R18 had the ability to kill autologous EBV-BL target cells incubated with peptide C6 and that T cell clones A2 and Al 1, Al 0, and Al 2 had cytotoxic activities to autologous EBV-BL cells expressing peptide C9 or Cl 1 de-In order to identify the minimal antigenic peptide for these T cell clones, a nested set of truncated peptides within the relevant region of C6, C9 or C 1 1 determinant were prepared and tested, in both proliferation and 5'Cr release assays. Peptides C6B (residues 119-145), C6C (residues 124-l 45) and C6E (residues 125-139) were equally efficient in proliferation assays, as compared to the antigenic 34-mer peptide C6 (C6A, residues 1 19-l 52). C6E (15 residues) is the shortest peptide that could stimulate T cell clones Rl 1 and R18 ( Table 2 ). The results obtained in cytotoxicity assays with T cell clones Rl 0, Rl 1 and R18 were found paralleled with the results in proliferation assays (data not shown). Thus these T cell clones displayed cytotoxic activities against autologous EBV-BL targets expressing epitopes C6C and C6E but not C6D, C6F or C6H. Besides the C9 peptide (C9A, residues 205-233), only the truncated peptide C9B (residues 205-2 16) stimulated the proliferative responses of T cell clones A2 and Al 1 (Table 2) . Peptides C9C (residues 210-221), C9D (residues 212-223) C9E (residues 222-233) and C9F (residues 216-227) gave negative results (Table 2) . Cytotoxic responses of A2 and Al 1 clones to truncated C9 peptides were found similar to the proliferation responses (data not shown). T cell clones Al 0 and Al 2 responded to all Cl 1 peptides, the antigenic 26- and Cl 1 F (residues 264-272) in proliferation assays (Table 2) . Cl 1 F is the shortest Cl 1 -truncated peptide that stimulated the T cell clones with significant cell proliferation responses (Table 2 ). In 5'Cr release assays, T cell clones Al 0 and Al 2 were cytotoxic against autologous EBV-BL target cells expressingpeptidescll (CllA), CllB,CllC,andCllE, but not Cl 1 D and Cl 1 F (data not shown). These results suggest that there is some difference in the T cell recognition of Cl 1 epitope between two T cell functional assays. It appears that the induction of cytotoxic responses of these T cell clones to C 1 1 -binding targets requires residues TTER of Cl 1 sequence. We are interested in determining whether these T cell clones were restricted through different HLA determinants. mAbs specific to monomorphic regions of the HLA-A.B.C., HLA-DR, and HLA-DQ antigens were a A total of 2 X 1 O4 T cell from each clone were tested for their proliferative response to each synthetrc peptide at a final concentration of 1 pg/ml in the presence of APC (6000-rad r-irradiated autologous EBV-BC cell).\n\n*The amino acid sequence of each peptide was derived from the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the C protein of RV M33.\n\nc Underlined sequence indicates the shortest peptide with significant cell proliferation. Responsor T cell clones are shown in parentheses, tested for their ability to block presentation of the C6 and Cl 1 peptide epitopes by autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Stimulation of clones RlO and Rl 1 by peptide C6, clone Al 1 by peptide C9 and clone Al 2 by peptide Cl 1 were clearly inhibited in the presence of anti-HLA-DR, DQ mAb 9.3FlO (Van Voorhis et a/., 1983) and anti-HLA-DR mAb L243 (Lampson and Levy, 1980) but not in the presence of the anti-HLA-A.B.C. mAb W6/32 (Brodskyand Parham, 1982) and anti-HI-A-DC! mAbs IVD12 (Giles et al., 1983 ) (data not shown). These results indicate that these T cell clones were HLA-DR-restricted. In order to complete a detailed analysis of the genetic restriction of the capsid peptide specific T cell clones, we used 10 EBV-BLs with different HLA phenotypes as APCs in proliferation assays (Table 3 ) and as targets in cytotoxicity assays. Six homozygous human HLA phenotype cell line (HCL) cells were used as target cells in 5'Cr release assays in this study (Table 4 ). The characterization of the restriction elements of T cell clones Rl 1 and R18 was established by using both proliferation and 5'Cr release assays. The peptide C6 (residues 119-152) was presented by EBV-BL RM and DO, but not by others in proliferation assays (Table 3) . EBV-BL RM is an autologous B cell line of T cell clones Rl 1 and R18. The most important difference between EBV-BL DO and 6 other EBV-BLs is that the former shares the HLA DRw9 phenotype with RM (Table 3) . Similar results were observed in 5'Cr release assays. Five EBV-BLs were used as target cells. These T cell clones recognized only RM and DO targets but not HE, MS, and AT targets (data not shown). These results suggested that the restriction molecule used to present the C6 determinant is of DRwS-associated haplotype.\n\nIn order to define the restriction molecules in the responses of T cell clone Al 1 to the C9 determinant, we tested the cytotoxic responses of T cell clone Al 1 against six HCLs and five EBV-BLs previously incubated with the C9 peptide. The results demonstrated that T cell clone Al 1 recognized only HCL PRIESS (Table 4) and EBV-BLs CM, AT, and MT (data not shown), all of which share the HLA DR4 phenotype. EBV-BL AT is the autologous EBV-BL of T cell clone Al 1. The results of proliferation assays using EBV-BLs as APCs correlated well with the results of these cytotoxicity assays. T cell clones A2 and Al 1 responded to C9 peptide when this peptide was presented by EBV-BLs (CM, HC, MS, N, AT, and MT) which expressed the DR4 phenotype, but not by RM and LM (data not shown). Hence, DR4 is the restriction element presenting the C9 peptide epitope to T cell clone Al 1.\n\nThe restriction specificity of T cell clones A10 and Al 2 to the Cl 1 determinant was analyzed by using 5'Cr release assays. Six HCLs and EBV-BL AT were used as targets for T cell clone Al 2. The results show that T cell clone Al2 was strongly lytic only against EBV-BL AT and HCL PRIESS, which share the HLA DR4 phenotype with the autologous EBV-BL AT ( Fig.  2A) . When clone A10 was used as the effector, four EBV-BL cells previously incubated with Cl 1 peptide were used as target cells in cytotoxicity assay. The results indicated that the T cell clone Al 0 was cytotoxic against targets (EBV-BLs CM, AT, and MT) which expressed the DR4 phenotype, but not against target RM (Fig. 2C) . These results demonstrate that the genetic restriction molecule of T cell clones Al 0 and Al 2 is DR4. In proliferation responses of T cell clones Al 0 and Al 2, however, EBV-BL LM, whose DR phenotype is DRl, like CM, HC, MS, AJ, and AT, were able to present the Cl 1 determinant (data not shown). In order to further test the ability of EBV-BL LM presenting Cl 1 to T cell clone Al 2, we used EBV-BL LM cells as the targets in the 5'Cr release assay. The results indicated that EBV-BL LM was able to elicit a cytotoxic response of T cell clone Al 2 to peptide Cl 1 similar to that elicited by target cells such as AT and AJ (Fig. 28) . ND ND ND ND a Cloned T cells 2 X 1 O4 were cultured for 72 hr in the presence of r-irradiated (3000 rad) EBV-BL cells 2 X 1 O4 as APC from 10 HLA-typed donors with or without C6 peptide (5 &ml). [3H]thymidine was added over the last 18 hr of culture. Results are expressed as the mean cpm of triplicate cultures.\n\nb APC RM is autologous EBV-BL for these CG-specific clones. ' All cpms from the culture without C peptide were under 500 cpm. ND, not tested.\n\nTwo models have been proposed to predict and the study by Rothbard and Taylor (1988) points to the identify the amino acid sequences of antigen involved existence of a 4-to 5-amino acid sequence motif in a in T cell recognition. De Lisi and Berzofsky (1985) have large number of T cell antigenic determinants. Consisproposed that a large proportion of lymphocytes ap-tent with the first model, we found that C6E, C9B, and pearto react with a-helical amphipathic structures (AS)\n\nCl 1 E, which were efficient in inducing both proliferacontained within the amino acid sequences of the anti-tive and cytotoxic responses in the corresponding C6, gen proteins (Margalit et al., 1987) . On the other hand, C9, or Cl l-reactive T cell clones, are located at the B Cell lines used as targets were incubated with or without peptide C9 at 5 &ml overnight before addition of T cells. b Cytotoxicity was determined using the T cell clone Al 1 at an effectorkarget ratio of 5. peak region of the a-helix index within the C6, C9, or Cl 1 peptide sequences according to the profiles of a-helix, P-turn and hydrophilicity of the C protein of RV (Ou et a/., 1992) . We have analyzed the T cell motif (second model) structures within C6, C9, and Cl 1 sequences (Ou et a/., 1992) . C6E is located in the region between two T cell motif structures. C9B contains a 4-amino acid T cell motif structure. The Cl 1 E sequence contains only half of such a 4-amino acid structure. Although antigenicity prediction methods are popular for predicting the location of viral epitopes, our results indicate that that latter model may not achieve a high level of correct prediction.\n\nThe questions of HLA class II polymorphism and epitope selection are clearly important issues in the design of subunit or synthetic vaccines for the genetically diverse human populations. The HLA restriction patterns of T cell clones Al 0 and Al 2 are more complex than those of the clones mentioned above. Besides six EBV-BLs of HLA-DR4 phenotype, EBV-BL LM of DRl phenotype could also present peptide Cl 1 to stimulated clones Al 0 and Al 2 in proliferation responses (data not shown). Similar genetic restriction by HLA DR4 was shown in cytotoxicity assays (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, T cell clone Al 2 was cytotoxic against targets /u, AT, MT (DR4 phenotype), and LM (DRl phenotype), which presented Cl 1 determinants (Fig. 2B) . These results suggest that there is some cross-recognition by T cell clones between DRl and DR4 subtypes. This phenomenon is consistent with reports regarding HLA restriction of human T cell clones (Rees et a/., 1989; Lamb et al., 1988) . However, in contrast to this, T cell clone Al 2 exhibited specific cytotoxic responses against HCL PRIESS (DR4 pheno-type), which expressed Cl 1, but not against HCL MAJA of the HLA-DRl phenotype ( Fig. 2A) . There may be differences in the structure of the antigen-binding site between the DRl molecules of HCL MAJA and EBV-BL LM. Three different DRl subtypes that have amino acid substitution in the putative peptide-binding site (residues 52-86 of p domain) have been identified (Marsh and Bodmer, 1989 ). These differences between DRl subtypes may result in DR4-restricted Cl 1 peptide not binding with sufficient affinity or in the required conformation of the DRl molecule of HCL MAJA to stimulate the T cell clone. There is no cross-recognition by T cell clones A2 and Al 1 between DRl and DR4 subtypes. Similar results have been reported in the study of human T cell recognition of influenza virus (Brett et al., 1991) .\n\nExaminations of the fine specificity of T cell recognition of the protein antigens of viruses and parasites in both human and murine systems have revealed multiple but distinct T'cell sites among individuals with different HLA phenotypes or a panel of H-2 congenic strains. Due to the limits imposed on T cell antigen recognition by MHC restriction, it is becoming apparent that a number of T cell sites will be required to ensure that a synthetic vaccine will engage the majority of an outbred population. Presentation of a number of short synthetic T cell sites within a particular structure may be an economical and feasible way to accomplish this task (Milich, 1988) . The recognitions of C9 and Cl 1 by T cell clones were associated with DR4, which was the most frequently occurring HLA DR allele among orientals (22%) and is also common among Caucasians (13%). Furthermore, HLA-DRw9 is also frequent among orientals (12%) (Giles and Capra, 1985 ). Recently we have tested 20 T cell lines from 10 RV patients and 10 healthy donors with different HLA phenotypes by using 11 synthetic C peptides. Our results demonstrate that Cl 1, C6, and C9 are recognized by these T cell lines at a higher frequency than other peptides (unpublished data). These T cell determinants may be selected as the candidates for T cell sites for future RV vaccine development."}
