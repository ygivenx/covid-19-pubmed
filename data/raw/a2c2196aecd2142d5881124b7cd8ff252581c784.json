However, Lntx patients may lack classical signs of infection due to heavy immunosuppression, and rejection may be asymptomatic. In addition, there are possible links between infection and the development of rejection. 4 For example, viral pneumonia has been associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction and graft loss. 5 Antimicrobial peptides in respiratory secretions play an important role as a first line of defence against infections. 7 Lysozyme is the most abundant airway antimicrobial peptide, and is secreted primarily by neutrophils and sub-mucosal glands. 8 Heparin-binding protein (HBP) was initially recognized for its broad antimicrobial activity, but is now known to be a multifunctional inflammatory mediator that induces vascular leakage and acts as a chemoattractant and activator of monocytes. 9, 10 The protein is stored in secretory and azurophilic granules of neutrophils, and is rapidly released upon cell activation. 11 Plasma HBP has been described as a promising biomarker for severe sepsis and septic shock, 12 and elevated HBP levels have also been shown in cerebrospinal fluid during bacterial meningitis 13 and in urine during urinary tract infections. 14 Neither HBP nor lysozyme has previously been evaluated in BALF of Lntx patients. In this study, we quantified the two proteins together with the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF, and anti-inflammatory IL-10 in BALF collected during the first year after transplantation. The primary aim was to evaluate HBP and lysozyme as potential biomarkers for infection, and to determine their ability to discriminate infection from rejection in lung transplant recipients.\n\nThis prospective cohort study was conducted at Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital, one of two centers in Sweden that performs Lntx. Adult patients accepted for Lntx during the study period from October 2012 to December 2014 were eligible for inclusion. Patients younger than 18 years of age and patients with postoperative follow-up at other sites were excluded. All study participants were followed for a maximum of 1 year after transplantation. Written informed consent was obtained from all study patients. The study was approved by the regional ethics committee (Reg nr 433-08) and performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Standard protocol for immune suppression included induction therapy with ATG (anti-thymocyte globulin), followed by tacrolimus or cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids. All Lntx recipients were treated with cytomegalovirus and fungal prophylaxis for 3-6 months.\n\nBALF samples were collected at routine scheduled bronchoscopies at 3 and 6 months after Lntx or at diagnostic bronchoscopies performed in response to clinical symptoms. A minimal interval of 7 days was allowed between BALs to be included as a new sample in the study. BAL procedure followed a standardized protocol. Study samples for analyses of HBP, lysozyme, and cytokines were obtained after installation of 20 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), where the initial 10 mL of BALF was discharged after which a study sample of 10 mL was collected. Portions of 20 mL of PBS were then instilled to collect BALF according to a standard protocol for bacterial, fungal, and cytological analyses. BALF was sent to the Sk\u00e5ne University TBBs was semi-quantitatively reported as no, mild, or acute/abundant inflammation.\n\nThe likelihood of pulmonary infection at the time of BALF sampling was independently, and blinded to the results of the biomarkers, \n\nTo adjust for dilution of BALF in estimating the biomarker concen- \n\nChi-square, rank sum, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney U tests were Using logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) for infection (dichotomized into definite and probable vs no or possible infection and rejection) for each biomarker. We used generalized estimating equation (GEE) models to account for the possibility of dependency due to multiple observations from the same patient.\n\nThe different biomarkers were first analyzed in univariable models and secondly in models adjusted for time after Lntx. All statistical tests were two-sided, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) that \n\nIn total, 39 patients were transplanted during the study period. Five patients were not eligible for inclusion due to follow-up at another center, and one patient declined participation. Consequently, 33 patients were included in the study. Four participants died shortly after transplantation, before any study samples were collected, leaving 29 lung transplant recipients prospectively followed in this study. The patients, 12 women and 17 men, had a median age of 56 years, 86% underwent double lung transplantation, and cystic fibrosis was the most common underlying disease. For details on patient characteristics, see Table 2 . \n\nPatients were assessed for infection at the time of BAL as described in Table 1 Bacterial growth was detected in 54 BALF samples (48%).\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated bacterial species (12%), followed by Escherichia coli (9% At an HBP cut-off value of 150 ng/mL, sensitivity was 75% and specificity was 92% for the detection of infection; positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 92% and 76%, respectively. IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 performed similar to HBP, whereas lysozyme showed poor sensitivity and specificity (Table 3) . \n\nIn this prospective study on lung transplant recipients comparing different biomarkers for prediction of infection, we found that HBP, Similar to HBP and lysozyme, all cytokines increased with the likelihood of infection, mirroring increased inflammation. IL-10 has anti-inflammatory properties but showed the same pattern as the pro-inflammatory cytokines in this study. IL-10 is believed to play an important role in balancing the inflammatory response in order to limit host tissue damage. 19 For example, compared to wild-type mice, IL-10-deficient mice demonstrate more efficient bacterial clearance but higher mortality and increased neutrophil recruitment to the lung in response to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, 20 which underscores the regulatory role of IL-10 during infection. It could therefore be speculated that IL-10 increases simultaneously with pro-inflammatory cytokines in order to avoid excessive inflammation that would be harmful to the host.\n\nTo correct for dilution factors of BALF, we used the urea method as In this study, we found no significant differences in levels between rejection and noninfection for any of the biomarkers. Contrary to our results, Patella et al have demonstrated increased levels of IL-10 during rejection compared to no rejection. 22 One possible reason for this discrepancy is that rejection is defined differently in the two studies. Here, we identify rejection with TBB to ensure correct diagnosis. All tested biomarkers have in common that they indicate neutrophil-dominated inflammation. In contrast, rejection is primarily a T cell-driven process, 23 "}
