{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Risk-adapted Treatment Strategy For COVID-19 Patients Risk-adapted Treatment Strategy For COVID-19 Patients", "body": "The novel coronavirus-associated pneumonia, which was named 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by WHO, began to spread in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has now become a global public health crisis. As of March 3rd, 2020, there were a total of 80270 cumulative confirmed patients and 2981 cumulative deaths in China, and according to the WHO report, there were a total of 10566 confirmed patients and 166 deaths outside China. The limited clinical data indicated that COVID-19 was associated with high incidence of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and high mortality [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] .\n\nHowever, until now, there are no clear expert consensus or guidelines on how to treat COVID-19. We developed a risk-adapted treatment approach according to the illness severity; and the objective of this study is to investigate the short-term effect of this riskadapted treatment strategy on clinical manifestations alleviation, clinical imaging recovery and SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance.\n\nThis is a retrospective study and we collected the medical records of 55 COVID-19 patients for analysis. All these patients were admitted to the Unit Z6 (total of 64 beds) in Clinical characteristics include patient's age, sex, first clinical symptoms, days from onset of symptoms to hospital, respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), etc.\n\nLaboratory Parameters included tests of blood routin, liver and kidney function, coagulation, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, peripheral blood CD3+T-cells percentage, interleukin-6 level and SARS-CoV-2-IgG and IgM antibodies, etc. Nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were collected for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA which were tested by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) at least three times within 2 weeks.\n\nWe divided these 55 confirmed patients into three types: mild COVID-19-fever and mild respiratory symptoms, with pulmonary imaging such as computed tomography (CT) showing no obvious or only mild pneumonia; moderate COVID-19obvious respiratory symptoms such as fever and cough, and pulmonary CT indicates typical coronavirus pneumonia with overall lesions less than 30%; however, moderate patients have stable vital signs, and oxygen saturation\uff1e93% without oxygen support; and severe COVID-19at least 1 of clinical features which including reapiratory rate more than 30 breaths/minute at rest, oxygen saturation \u226493% without oxygen support, arterial oxygen partial pressure/fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) \u2264 300 mmHg, the total lesions on chest CT \u226530% or rapid progress \u226550% in next 72 hours (which were evaluated by two physicians and two radiologist).\n\nRisk-adapted treatment approaches were adopted for these patients. Treatment-failure patients should be prepared early for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation, and even considered with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [6] .\n\nVariables of clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatment approaches, and clinical outcomes, such as categorical variables were measured using \u03c7 2 test, and continuous variables were measured using Mann-Whitney U test between non-severe group (including mild and moderate patients ) and severe group. Statistical analyses were conducted using R statistical software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, respectively. Patients in severe group have a very lower lymphocyte count and CD3-T cells percentage than that in non-severe group (p=0.008, 0.002). The severe group also had a higher interleukin-6 level than that in non-severe group (p=0.02) (tabe 1). There were no significant differences between two groups in terms of white blood cell count \n\nIn this study, we developed a risk-adapted treatment approach for COVID-19 according to the illness severity (mild, moderate and severe). Our study indicates that use of riskadapted treatment approach in patients with COVID-19 was associated with significant clinical manifestations alleviation and clinical imaging recovery; and in patients with severe COVID-19, early and short-term use of low-dose methylprednisolone did not delay SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and influence the IgG type antibody production when compared with non-severe patients.\n\nCOVID-19 is characterized by fever, dry cough and fatigue, and a few patients have symptoms of nausea or vomiting and diarrhea, etc [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . However, in clinical practice, COVID-19 and other viral infections like influenza need to be further differentiated.\n\nInfluenza is also a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect upper respiratory tract, and sometimes the lungs; the main symptoms of influenza are sudden high fever, headache, myalgia, general malaise; It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death [7] [8] [9] . In this study, severe patients had abnormal hematological manifestations including significant lower lymphocytes and CD3+T cells, increased fibribogen, D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) levels; a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 very high interleukin-6 level which demonstrated that cytokines storm might exsit. Some clinical studies also found acute cardiac injury and acute renal injury in severe patients [1] [2] [3] . These findings indicated that COVID-19 is a systemic disease, not just pneumonia.\n\nHowever, critical influenza may also cause complications with high morbidity and mortality, such as pneumonia, myocarditis, central nervous system disease and death [9] .\n\nIn this situation, we recommend to use a broad-spectrum molecular diagnostic panel for rapid detection of the most common respiratory pathogens to make a differential diagnosis [10] . In clinical emergency or intensive care unit, pneumonia with unknown cause is accompanied by lymphocytopenia, elevated interleukin-6 level and other obvious abnormal laboratory parametres, clinicians should ask if the patients or their families have any contact history with COVID-19 patient, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid should be detected timely [10] .\n\nFor the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, clinicians need to conduct clinical classification based on patient's clinical symptoms and laboratory test results (including chest CT). Different clinical types indicate that patients have different pathophysiological processes or are at different stages of disease development, and therefore require tailored treatment aproaches. Although the efficacy of antiviral therapy is still uncertain, combination treatment based on the inhibition of viral replication might reduce the inflammatory injury, and can allow the body to gradually produce enough virus-specific antibodies to clear the virus through the immune response, and ultimately cure the disease. There is a great debate on the use of corticosteroids for coronavirus infection such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [11, 12] and Middle East respiratory ryndrome (MERS) [13, 14] , and the data of systemic corticosteroid treatment in critical COVID-19 are lacking. The findings of this study support the use of corticosteroids in severe COVID-19. Early use (immediately on admission or within the first three days of hospitalization) might relatively rapid control the disease progress or avoid disease further deterioration. Short-term and low-dose administration (methylprednisolone 0.5mg~1mg/kg.d\u00d75 days) could avoid the corticosteroid's potential risks; on the other hand, such cortocosteroid use does not influence the SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody production.\n\nIn conclusion, we established a risk-adapted treatment strategy for COVID-19, and this strategy could be considered a useful and efficient approach for these patients based on our short-term observation. However, this study has certain limitations. It is a retrospective study in a single center, and the sample is relatively small, and the observation time is short; continued evaluations of this risk-adapted treatment strategy are needed.\n\nThis research received no external funding.\n\nEthical approval was obtained from the ethics committees of the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China. This is a retrospective and observational study and the informed consent was obtained.\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest. "}
