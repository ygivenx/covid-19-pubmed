{"title": "The role of BST2/tetherin in infection with the feline retroviruses", "body": "Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is an important global lentiviral pathogen that infects both domestic and nondomestic felids (Brown et al., 1993 (Brown et al., , 1994 Carpenter et al., 1996; Hofmann-Lehmann et al., 1996; Troyer et al., 2004 Troyer et al., , 2005 . FIV infection of domestic cats (Felis catus) results in a fatal immunodeficiency syndrome similar to AIDS in humans infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Pedersen et al., 1987 Yamamoto et al., 1988; Pedersen, 1993; Bendinelli et al., 1995) . The virus-induced gradual immunological deterioration leads to common clinical signs such as recurrent gingivitis and stomatitis, lymphoma, loss of condition (cachexia/wasting), neurological disorders and high mortality in infected cats (Pedersen et al., 1987; Hosie et al., 1989; Sparger et al., 1989; Yamamoto et al., 1989; Ackley et al, 1990 ; Torten et al., 1991; Callanan et al., 1992 Callanan et al., , 1996 Pedersen, 1993) . Because of the high degree of similarity between the genomic organization, the mode of transmission and the pathology of HIV and FIV infections, the domestic cat has been established as the smallest natural animal model for studying the development of AIDS in humans and for evaluating potential intervention strategies (Willett et al,, 1997; Miller et al., 2000; Troyer et al., 2004) .\n\nThe ability of retroviruses to initiate a complex array of interactions with host cell proteins and other factors is a critical determinant of cell tropism, successful replication and persistence within the host. The majority of these host-virus interactions are beneficial for the virus (Malim, 2009 ). In recent years, however, a group of intracellular proteins has been identified that specifically evolved to interfere with viral replication. These proteins are collectively called restriction factors and form a separate branch of the innate immunity termed intrinsic immunity (Bieniasz, 2004; Goff, 2004) . Restriction factors affect almost all stages of the viral lifecycle (Bieniasz, 2004) , such as uncoating, reverse transcription, nuclear entry and egress, and their cell-type and species-specific expression and activity control the viral host spectrum and may impose a barrier to cross-species transmission events (Troyer et al., 2008) . In order to efficiently replicate and to evade immune surveillance, retroviruses have to overcome this line of defense and, thus, have evolved proteins that antagonize the actions of restriction factors or mechanisms to avoid them.\n\nA better understanding of the interactions between host restriction factors and their viral antagonists will help to improve animal models for infection and to facilitate the identification of potential targets for antiviral therapies as well as retroviral gene delivery.\n\nThe longest (alpha) isoform of TRIM5, a member of the tripartite interaction motif family of proteins (Reymond et al., 2001 , Stremlau et al., 2004 , and APOBEC3 (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide 3) proteins, a family of cellular polynucleotide cysteine deaminases (Teng et al., 1993; Sheehy et al., 2002; Mangeat et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2003) , constitute the so-called early post-entry blocks to retroviral infection and have been well characterized in humans, non-human primates and domestic cats. (Yamauchi et al., 2008) and ubiquination of the complex targets it for proteosome-mediated degradation (Diaz-Griffero et al., 2006; Towers, 2007) . It has been proposed that TRIM5\u03b1 may accelerate or abrogate viral uncoating (Stremlau et al., 2006) which not only inhibits reverse transcription but also nuclear import of viral cDNA (Berthoux et al., 2004; Wu et al, 2006) . Previously, we reported that the TRIM5 transcript in cat cells possesses a truncation in the B30.2 capsid binding domain, which ablates its restrictive function (McEwan et al., 2009 ).\n\nThe antiviral activity of APOBEC3 proteins was discovered through the study of the HIV-1 accessory protein Vif (viral infectivity factor) (Wolf and Goff, 2008) which was shown to be dispensable for viral replication in certain permissive cell lines such as CEM-SS and SupT1, but absolutely required in non-permissive cells such as primary CD4+ T cells, monocytederived macrophages, and some T cell leukemia lines such as CEM (Fisher et al., 1987; Strebel et al., 1987; Gabuzda et al., 1992; Sakai et al., 1993; Sova and Volsky, 1993) . The human APOBEC3G protein (A3G; initially called CEM-15) was identified as the responsible cellular factor whose expression renders human cells non-permissive for infection by HIV-1 strains devoid of the Vif gene, but not by Vif-proficient HIV-1 strains (Sheehy et al., 2002) . A3G belongs to a large family of cytosine deaminases (reviewed in Harris and Liddament, 2004; Conticello et al., 2007; Holmes et al., 2007; Aguiar and Peterlin, 2008; Conticello, 2008; Goila-Gaur and Strebel, 2008 ) that catalyze the hydrolysis of cytosines to uracils. In order to carry out its anti-viral activity, A3G has to be packaged into Vif-deficient virions as they are formed in producer cells (Sheehy et In addition to the early post-entry blocks, restriction factors such as tetherin contribute to a late block to retroviral replication in that they prevent the release of mature enveloped viral particles from the membranes of infected cells. Tetherin (also called HM1.24/BST-2/ CD317) was originally identified as a bone marrow stromal cell surface antigen selectively expressed on terminally differentiated normal and neoplastic human B cells and corresponding cell lines (Goto et al., 1994 , Ishikawa et al., 1995 . Several studies have shown that tetherins are novel type II transmembrane proteins with a molecular weight of \n\nBlast searches of the feline genome using known primate, rodent and canine tetherin sequences identified a candidate gene for a feline homologue of tetherin. The transcript was amplified from interferon-\u03c9 stimulated feline IL2-dependent T cell (MYA-1) cDNA. The nucleotide sequence (Genbank accession HM461970) was analyzed and revealed 59% nucleic acid and 44% amino acid identity between cat tetherin (hereafter referred to as feTHN) and its human homologue and 77% nucleic acid and 60% amino acid identity to canine tetherin, transcript variant 2 (XM860510) (Figure 1 ). Tetherin configuration rather than its amino acid sequence has been shown to be critical for its antiviral activity Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts helical region contains three conserved cysteines (C59, C69, C97). Additionally, feTHN was predicted to contain a C-terminal GPI anchor signal sequence and the potential GPI anchor attachment site has been mapped to S161. Thus, both amino acid sequence and topology described for different tetherins are conserved in feTHN.\n\nThe expression levels of feTHN in feline T cell (MYA-1), fibroblast (AH927), kidney epithelioid (CrFK) and fetal embryo fibroblast-like (FEA) cell lines and the effect of treatment with type I interferons and IFN-\u03b3 (1000 U/ml) on its expression were examined by qRT-PCR. All cell lines showed a basal feTHN expression with FEA cells expressing approximately 10-fold lower levels compared to the other cell lines tested. Tetherin expression was inducible by type I IFN (\u03b1, \u03c9) in all four cell lines, whereas treatment with IFN-\u03b3 had little effect on tetherin expression in MYA cells but up-regulated tetherin expression markedly in AH927, CrFK and FEA cells. In conclusion, feTHN shares the expression profile of huTHN.\n\nIn order to assess the potency of feline tetherin to inhibit viral release, single-cycle viral replication assays were performed. FIV(VSV-G)-GFP pseudotypes were produced by transfecting 293T cells with the FIV-based vectors FP93 (Gagpol) and pGinSin (GFP) (Poeschla et al., 1998) and the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G)-encoding vector pMDG (Yee et al., 1994) in the presence or absence of feTHN. The pseudotypes were used to transduce CrFK cells and the viral titre was determined by flow cytometry. FeTHN caused a marked and dose-dependent reduction of the FIV(VSV-G)-GFP titer (Figure 2A ). Inhibition of viral release was confirmed by immunoblotting against viral p24 in the culture supernatants ( Figure 2D ). In contrast to viral release, virus production was unaffected by the expression of feTHN. HIV-1 wild-type pseudotypes were produced as described above using the HIV-1-derived vector p8.2 (Gagpol) ans CSGW (GFP) (Naldini et al., 1996) and pMDG. Pseudotypes of Vpu-deficient HIV-1 (HIV-1 \u0394 Vpu) were generated using p8.91 (Gagpol) (Naldini et al., 1996) , CSGW and pMDG. Feline tetherin was equally effective in blocking HIV-1 \u0394Vpu and HIV-1 wild-type viral release ( Figures 2B,C and 2D ), suggesting that its activity was not counteracted by HIV-1 Vpu. This finding underlines the concept of species-specificity of the tetherin-Vpu interaction (Yang et al., 2010) .\n\nIn contrast to the well-defined role of tetherin in preventing viral release, information on its potency to block viral replication and spread is sparse. To this end, CrFK cells were stably transduced with a feTHN expression construct and infected with low or high inputs of CrFK-tropic strains of FIV-Pco (CoLV) or FIV-Fca (Petaluma F14) and virus production monitored by RT assay. Surprisingly and in contrast to the marked inhibitory effect of tetherin on lentiviral pseudotype production, ectopic expression of tetherin did not inhibit virus production from FIV-infected CrFK cells. Instead, syncytium formation was enhanced in the tetherin-expressing cells compared with control cells as virions are trapped at the cell surface promoting cell-cell fusion. As FIV-Pco and FIV-Fca (Petaluma F14) are cell cultureadapted viral strains, we generated CrFK cells and CrFK-feTHN cells stably expressing the viral primary receptor CD134 (Shimojima et al., 2004) and studied the effect of feTHN on replication of the primary strains of FIV, GL8 and PPR. Again, feTHN did not influence the viral growth rate. In summary, these findings suggest that feTHN is unable to prevent replication of cell-culture adapted and primary strains of FIV.\n\nOverall, feline tetherin resembles human tetherin in amino acid sequence, protein topology and anti-viral activity. It is expressed in different feline cells in to a basic level and its expression can be significantly enhanced by treatment with type I or type II IFN. FeTHN exhibited a potent, dose-dependent block to retroviral particle release, which was not relieved by the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu. In stark contrast to particle release, stable expression of feTHN had no effect on FIV replication and even increased the likelihood of cell-cell fusion events thus possibly promoting viral cell-to-cell spread. Given the fact that feTHN was expressed from a CMV promoter in both the transiently and stably transfected cells, these findings suggest that the number of tetherin molecules on the cell surface might be limited and that feTHN therefore has only a saturable capacity to prevent viral particle release from productively infected cells. In single-cycle replication assays, however, the amount of virus particles to be retained at the cell surface might be lower so that virus release can be controlled by tetherin.\n\nIndeed, there is evidence that Vpu-deficient HIV-1 can replicate in tissue culture with the same kinetics as wild-type virus (Strebel et al., 1988; Terwilliger et al., 1989; Klimkait et al., 1990) by shifting from a cell-free to a cell-to-cell mode of replication. As a consequence of this shift, viral replication was, in contrast to viral release, not inhibited. Further, it was recently shown that in T cells infected with Vpu-defective HIV-1, but not wild-type HIV-1, virus envelope proteins accumulated on the cell surface due to the action of tetherin, which promoted formation of virological synapses (VS) and direct cell-to-cell spread of virions (Jolly et al., 2010) .\n\nFuture research should focus on the role of tetherin as a regulator of innate immunity. Tetherin has been shown to be a specific marker of type I IFN-producing cells (IPCs) or plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) (Blasius et al., 2006) . These cells circulate through the blood and infiltrate lymph nodes that drain sites of infection. Viruses trigger Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/9-induced production of large amounts of type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines that activate anti-viral intrinsic, innate and adaptive immune responses (Colonna et al., 2004; Liu, 2005) . A chronic activation of pDCs and continuous IFN production caused by lentivirus infection leads to immune dysregulation, T cell anergy and apoptosis (Tompkins and Tompkins, 2008) . Tetherin has been shown to interact with the orphan receptor immunoglobin-like transcript (ILT7), which is expressed exclusively on pDCs (Cao et al., 2006) . This interaction induces a negative feedback loop on the production of type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokine production and adjusts the magnitude of immune activation upon viral infection. Additionally, tetherin incorporation into the lipid envelopes of viral particles could enhance their uptake into professional antigen presenting cells (APCs).
