{"title": "The Functional Properties of Preserved Eggs: From Anti-cancer and\nAnti-inflammatory Aspects", "body": "Preserved egg, a well-received traditional egg product in China, is produced by\nmarinating raw duck egg with CaO, H2O, and Na2CO3,\nand other spices (Hou, 1981). Owing to its\nunique flavor and attractive color and texture, preserved egg is a popular marinated\negg product in China. In addition, the percentage of nine amino acids in preserved\negg yolk and egg white was higher than that of fresh egg yolk and egg white after\npickling (Zhang et al., 1998), the species of\ntotal fatty acids were increased from 23 to 27, as well as the species of free fatty\nacids were increased from 7 to 13 (Zhao et al., 2014a), which makes preserved eggs have a higher nutritional value.\n\nMany alkaline-fermented foods, such as preserved eggs, plant beans, seeds, and\nleaves, are consumed extensively in China, Japan, Africa, and Southeast Asia. After\nalkali- fermentation, the nutritional value of food can be enhanced, which is\nclosely related to the conversion of proteins to amino acids (Odunfa, 1988). Compared to fresh duck eggs, preserved\neggs have higher protein contents and lower carbohydrate contents (Hou, 1981). Furthermore, alkaline-forming food has\nbeen shown to inhibit the growth and invasion of tumor cell in\nvitro (Corder et al., 2001).\nStudies have shown that preserved egg white hydrolysates show anti-inflammatory\neffects in vitro and in vivo experiments and can\nsignificantly decrease the expression levels of IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 (Zhao et al.,\n2017). In addition, ACE-inhibitory\npeptides isolated from preserved eggs proved their antioxidant activity in\nvitro (Yang, 2016). Numerous\nstudies have indicated that alkaline foods, such as kelp (Yuan and Walsh, 2006), grape (Renaud and De, 1992), and bitter gourd (Rajasekhar et al.,\n2012), can inhibit the growth of various\nhuman cancer cell lines. The results showed that the algae polyphenols extracted\nfrom kelp can inhibit the rancidity of fish oil and the antioxidant efficiency was\n2.6-fold higher than that of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) (Yan et al., 1996). Researchers found that seaweed\npolyphenols can significantly inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, and the\ninhibition effect was linearly correlated to the total level of phenol in seaweed\n(Yuan and Walsh, 2006). Resveratrol in grapes\nwas shown to have inhibitory effects on cancer cell initiation, proliferation and\ndevelopment (Corder et al., 2001).\n\nAt present, the research on the preserved eggs is limited on the optimization of\nprocessing technology. In this paper, the functional characteristics of preserved\neggs were monitored using complementary in vitro and in\nvivo models. The levels of liver lipid and inflammatory factors in rats\nbefore and after treatment, as well as the ability of preserved eggs to inhibit\ntumor cells in vitro were investigated. The objective is to explore\nthe nutritional and anticancer values of preserved eggs. Our findings will\ncontribute to provide the theoretical basis for understanding the relationship\nbetween preserved eggs and human health.\n\nAll chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical\nReagent Co., Ltd (China). The TG assay kit, TCHO assay kit, HDL cholesterol\nassay kit and LDL cholesterol assay kit were provided by Nanjing Jiancheng\nBiology Engineering Institute (China). The rat IL-6 ELISA kit and rat\nTNF-\u03b1 ELISA kit were provided by Neobioscience Biology Engineering\nInstitute (China). The caspase-3 activity assay kit was purchased from Beyotime\nInstitute of Biotechnology (China). Annexin V-FITC/PI kit was supplied by Zoman\nBiotechnology Co., Ltd (China). Caco-2 cells were obtained from the cell bank of\nChinese academy of sciences (China).\n\nFresh duck eggs (65\u201370 g) were obtained from Hubei Shendan Healthy Food\nCo., Ltd (China). Preserved eggs were obtained using clear material soaking\nmethod (Zhao et al., 2014b) with some\nmodifications. Duck eggs soaked with a kind of special solution containing 4.5%\nof NaOH, 3% of NaCl, 0.4% of CuSO4, and 3.5% of Chinese black tea at\n25\u00b0C. After 35 d, preserved eggs were obtained. After peeling, the\npreserved eggs were stirred in a homogenizer and lyophilized to obtain preserved\negg powders.\n\nTwenty-five female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats aged 2\u20133 wk were obtained\nfrom Tongji Medical College, Huazhong Science and Technology University. All\nrats were kept and treated according to the requirements of the Laboratory\nAnimal Ethics Review Committee (Animal Welfare No. 00140424). Sufficient\nfood and water were provided and the room temperature and relative humidity\nwere controlled in the range of 20\u00b12\u00b0C and 50\u00b15%,\nrespectively.\n\nAfter one week of adaptive feeding, five rats were sacrificed as 0-day\ncontrol group. The rest were labeled with 3% picric acid solution (yellow)\nand 0.5% neutral magenta solution (red). After labeling, the rats were\nrandomly divided into 4 experiment groups and 5 rats contained in each\ngroup. The rats in control group were intragastric administrated with\ndistilled water while the other groups were administrated with the preserved\negg powder at concentrations of 1.4 mg/mL (low-dose group), 2.8 mg/mL\n(middle-dose group) and 4.2 mg/mL (high-dose group) in distilled water of 2\nmL respectively. The specific measurement was based on human and rat dose\nconversion formula, low dose, medium dose and high dose equivalent to every\nadult eats 1, 2 and 3 preserved eggs a day. The experiment period was 80 d.\nThe behavior of the rats was observed every day, including their body\nweight, food & water intake, mood and stool status. The weight of\neach rat was measured every five days and the food intake was determined\nevery three days.\n\nThe rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the liver was extracted\nwith tweezers after fasted overnight at the end of the experiment (80 d\nafter treatment). We collected rats blood of the retro-orbital plexus and\nput the livers in a centrifuge tube followed by homogenization with 4 mL of\nmethanol and acetone mixture (1:1). Then the mixture was centrifuged at\n11,000\u00d7g for 15 min, and the supernatant was collected and stored at\n-20\u00b0C for analysis of lipids, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. TG, TCHO, LDL\ncholesterol and HDL cholesterol were mesured by the TG assay kit, TCHO assay\nkit, HDL cholesterol assay kit and LDL cholesterol assay kit following the\nmanufacture\u2019s instructions. IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were mesured by the\nrat IL-6 ELISA kit and rat TNF-\u03b1 ELISA kit following the\nmanufacture\u2019s instructions.\n\nSimulated GI digestion using in vitro pepsin\u2013pancreatin\nhydrolysis was conducted as described by You et al (2010) with some modifications. The powder was dissolved\n(10% w/v, in distilled water) and the pH was adjusted to 2.0 with 1 M HCl. Then\npepsin (1.25% of the powder, w/w) was added. The mixture was incubated at\n37\u00b0C for 2 h. The pH was then adjusted to 7.0 with the 1 M\nNaHCO3 solution. Pancreatin was added (2% of the powder, w/w).\nAnd the mixture was further incubated at 37\u00b0C for 4 h. To terminate the\ndigestion, the samples were kept in boiling water for 15 min. Then the GI\ndigests were cooled to room temperature and centrifuged at 11,000\u00d7g for\n15 min. The supernatant was lyophilized, sealed in plastic bags and stored at\n-20\u00b0C before use.\n\nTo investigated the changes in cell proliferation inhibition rate of preserved\neggs during simulated GI digestion, aliquots of GI digests were removed at 0\n(pepsin digestion after 2 h), 1, 2, 3, 4 h (switch from 0 h to 4 h during\npancreatin digestion) during digestion procession.\n\nThe human colon cell line Caco-2 was purchased from the Type Culture Collection\nof the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. Cells were placed into 75\ncm2 tissue culture flasks and grown at 37\u00b0C under a\nhumidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in DMEM medium with high glucose, 10%\nFBS, 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 units/mL streptomycin.\n\nThe cells were seeded on the six-well plate and adhered for 24 h, followed by\ntreatment with GI digests for further 24 h. The morphology, size and rupture\nof the cell were observed by fluorescence uptake microscope (IX71, Olympus\nCo., Ltd, Japan).\n\nApproximately 5A105 cells/well of Caco-2 cells were placed in\n96-well plates and incubated for 24 h. Then the cells were exposed to 0.1,\n0.5, 2.5, 5, 10 mg/mL of the GI digests for 24 h. The medium was removed at\nthe end of incubation and each well was incubated with 10 \u03bcL of cck-8\nsolution (no bubbles) for 2 h, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a\nmicroplate reader (iMark, Lenovo Biological Technology Co., Ltd, China).\n\nApproximately 2.5A105 cells/well of Caco-2 cells were placed in\n6-well plates and incubated for 24 h. The cells were exposed to 2.5, 5, 10\nmg/mL of the GI digests for 24 h after carefully washed with PBS, set the\ncell without the digests as a blank control. After incubation, the cells\nwere immediately collected and washed 2 times by PBS, then centrifuged at a\nspeed of 2,000\u00d7g for 5 min to remove the supernatant, 500 \u03bcL\nbinding buffer, 5 \u03bcL Annexin V-FITC and PI were added to suspend the\ncells, respectively. Mixtures were finally incubated in dark at room\ntemperature for 15 min prior to investigation by flow cytometry\n(FACSCalibur, BD Co., Ltd, USA) for 1 h.\n\nApproximately 2A106 cells/well of Caco-2 cells were placed in\n6-well plates and exposed to 2.5, 5, 10 mg/mL of the GI digests for 24 h. We\nset the cell without the digests as a blank control. After incubation, the\ncells were immediately collected and washed 2 times by PBS, then centrifuged\nat a speed of 2,000\u00d7g for 5 min to remove the supernatant. The cells\nwere collected after the lysate was added to the cells at a rate of 100\n\u03bcL/ 2/106 cells, and the remaining steps were performed\nbased on the instructions from caspase-3 activity assay kit.\n\nThe results were analyzed using software of IBM SPSS Statistics 20. All data were\nexpressed as the mean\u00b1standard error. Statistical significance was\nassessed using the Duncan\u2019s multiple range test, where\np<0.05 was considered significant, and the origin 7.5\nsoftware was used for drawing.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 1, the body weight of\nrats treated with preserved eggs for 80 days was not significantly different\nat the end of treatment from that of control rats (p>0.05).\nThe gain of body weight was normal in preserved egg-treated rats and there\nwas no significant difference between control and preserved egg-treated\nrats.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the TG and TCHO\ncontents of rats treated with the preserved eggs were significantly\ndecreased (p<0.05) compared with the control group\nafter 80 days (Fig. 2). In the\nhigh-dose group (4.2 mg/mL), the TG and TCHO contents in the liver were\nfound to decrease by 13.3% (Fig. 2A)\nand 29.6% (Fig. 2B) respectively\ncompared with the control group. However, as the dose raised up to high\nlevel (4.2 mg/mL), the TG levels in rats increased compared to treatment\nwith low doses of preserved eggs. On the one hand, the increase of TG levels\nmay be due to the upregulation of the expression of fatty acid synthase\n(FAS) in livers after treated with high doses of preserved egg (Kakuma et\nal., 2000). FAS is the key enzyme in\nliver fatty acid synthesis, TG increases with the increasement of the FAS\n(Postic and Girard, 2008).\n\nOn the other hand, the level of cholesterol was 450 mg per 100 g preserved\negg (Ge et al., 2017). As egg yolk is\nrich in TG, the intake of high dose of preserved eggs elevated TG levels in\nrats. So, the TG levels were observed to be elevated by high dose preserved\neggs (Fig. 2A). Actually, our body\nhealth has been proved to be favored by an appropriate of eggs intake daily\nbecause it exerts protective effect on our heart. The ingredients in the\neggs can also regulate the absorption and metabolism of cholesterol and\ncounteract the damage caused by excessive intake on the body (Yang, 2013). This could partly explain the\nfact that preserved egg could reduce the content of TG in a proper range\n(Fig. 2A).\n\nAs shown in Fig. 3, the preserved eggs\nsignificantly decreased the level of LDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C in rat\u2019s\nliver after 80-days treatment (p<0.05), by 92.8%\n(Fig. 3A) and 85.1% (Fig. 3B) in the low-dose group, 53.0%\n(Fig. 3A) and 87.5% (Fig. 3B) in high-dose group compared with\ncontrol group. After treatment with preserved egg, the level of LDL was\nsignificantly inhibited compared with the control, and an increase of LDL\nlevel was observed as the concentration of preserved egg increased. It may\nbe due to TG invoved in preserved eggs upregulating LDL-C levels (Cullen,\n2000; Ji et al., 2013), as the dosage of preserved eggs\nincreased, the level of LDL-C increased. This result corresponds to the\nprevious explanation for TG. These results showed that long-term intake of\npreserved eggs may help to reduce the risk of atherosclerosis (AS),\ncerebrovascular disease (CVD) and heart disease.\n\nAs shown in the Fig. 4, the level of\nIL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in rat\u2019s liver were significantly decreased\ncompared to control group (p<0.05) after treaments.\nIn low-dose group (1.4 mg/mL), the IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 values in liver\nwere decreased 79.8% (Fig. 4A) and\n21.3% (Fig. 4B) respectively,\nindicating that preserved eggs contribute to reduce the risk of inflammation\nin rats. However, at 2.8 mg/mL of preserved eggs, the production of IL-6 was\nrather increased than control. This may be limited by the amout of\ninflammatory cytokine receptor. Due to the inflammatory factor - receptor\nreaction, the most appropriate amount of preserved eggs may be around 1.4\nmg/mL. Therefore, the optimal value is shown at 1.4 mg/mL. When it exceeds\n1.4 mg/mL, the reaction rate decreases.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 5, the cellular\nproliferation inhibition rate (CPIR) of preserved eggs on Caco-2 cells\nexhibited a digestion time and sample concentration dependent manner. At the\nsame digestion time, the anti-proliferation rates of Caco-2 cells were\ngradually increased with the increase of sample concentration\n(p<0.05). From Table 1, with the changes of digestion time (from 0 h to 4 h),\nthe IC50 values of the preserved eggs on anti- proliferation of Caco-2 cells\nwere changed too. The IC50 value of preserved eggs reached the lowest after\n2 h gastric digestion and 2 h intestinal digestion, which was 5.75 mg/mL.\nThe inhibition rate reached 56.64% when the GI digests concentration was 10\nmg/mL, about 5.6 times than that of before intestinal digestion.\nConsequently, we chose the sample that digested 2 h by pepsin and 2 h by\ntrypsin to advance further experiments with the concentration of 2.5 mg/mL,\n5 mg/mL, and 10 mg/mL.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 6, the cells in the\ncontrol group (0 mg/mL of GI digests) were closely arranged, complement in\nmorphology, and good in growth status. In the pictures, it was observed that\nthe cell morphology was destroyed under the treatment with the GI digests.\nNotably, when the GI digests concentration increased up to 10 mg/mL, cells\nwere cleaved into fragments, and the cell morphology was collapsed.\n\nAs shown in Table 2, the apoptosis\nbehavior of cells greatly dependended on the dose of GI digests. The\nsignificantly enhanced cell death rate was observed (Fig. 7), accompanied by the delay in most of the\napoptotic cells in high dose treatment. This result suggested that the GI\ndigests could cause apoptosis in Caco-2 cells.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 8, the activity of\ncaspase-3 in Caco-2 cells was significantly increased with a dose dependent.\nIn addition, the activity of caspase-3 in the high concentration group (10\nmg/mL) was 2.6 times of the control group (p<0.05).\nCaspase is an important mediator of cell apoptosis. They are induced by\nvarious stimuli and contribute to cell apoptosis by cutting various cell\nsubstrates (Fan et al., 2005;\nNu\u00f1ez et al., 1998; Riedl and\nShi, 2004). The results showed that\npreserved egg digests can significantly induced the cell apoptosis by\nup-regulating caspase-3 levels in Caco-2 cells.\n\nIn present study, we found that preserved eggs decreased the levels of TG, TCHO, and\nLDL/HDL in rat\u2019s liver, which are related to lipid metabolism in rats (van\nder Made et al., 2014). we found that\npreserved eggs could significantly reduce the TG and TCHO contents in liver. In the\nlow-dose group, TG and TCHO contents were decreased by 19.5% and 6.8% respectively,\nindicating that the preserved eggs are conductive in antilipemic capacity. This\ncould be involved with several major influencing factors: 1) some active substance\nsuch as apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype (Miettinen et al., 1988; Kes\u00e4niemi et al., 1987) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) genotype (Morise et al.,\n1994) may promote the lipoprotein\nmetabolism and transformation in the liver; 2) the substances above may inhibit the\nintestinal absorption of cholesterol, further reducing the synthesis of cholesterol\nand improving the decomposition rate of TG in the liver (Wang et al., 2014). Furthermore, results also showed that\nthe preserved eggs can significantly reduce the LDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C level in\nrat\u2019s liver. After treatment with preserved eggs of low dose, the LDL-C\nlevels in the liver were reduced by 92.8% compared with the control group. In\nprevious studies, LDL and LDL / HDL could be used to predict CVD, and the risk of\nCVD can be reduced lowering by 20% if LDL-C wad reduced by 1 mmol/L (Baigent et al.,\n2005). Based on this, we suspected that\nactive ingredients such as lecithin in preserved eggs may have the potential to\nreduce the risk of CVD, AS, and other diseases by inhibiting the synthesis of LDL-C\nand promoting the synthesis of HDL-C (Poutanen et al., 2003). In future, we will do further experiments to find out\nthe exactly active ingredients. Furthermore, the intake of preserved eggs depressed\nthe production of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, and these indicators are significantly\nrelated to the occurrence of inflammation and cancer in rats (Kim et al., 2013; Suganuma et al., 2012). Cell experiments results showed that the GI digests of\nthe preserved eggs could inhibit the growth of tumor cells Caco-2 and accelerated\ncell apoptosis after gastrointestinal digestion.\n\nIn vivo animal experiments, we found that fed with low-dose of\npreserved eggs could reduce the contents of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in rat\u2019s\ncytokines contents effectively, which are served as the key substances to induce\ncell transformation and malignancy in the course of chronic inflammation (Tang et\nal., 2013; Zhu et al., 2014). Our results are consistent with the evidences from tumor\ncell experiments. It could be ascribed to that the active components in preserved\neggs can repressed the release of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. This result is consistent\nwith the results of other studies (Zhao et al., 2017). Combinning with the results of cell apoptosis, we suspected that\nthis is more likely to be related to mitochondrial pathways (Dass\u00e9 et al.,\n2007; Lanvin et al., 2004). Therefore, we will focus on the mechanism of\nmitochondrial pathways in the following studies.\n\nFurthermore, the GI digests of the preserved eggs could inhibit the proliferation of\nCaco-2 cells and induce cell apoptosis. Apoptosis is a procedural and physiological\nform of death. The characteristics of apoptosis include cell morphological changes,\nthe formation of DNA fragments, etc. (Arends et al., 1990; Bortner et al., 1995). Tumor\ndevelopment is not only the result of cell proliferation out of control, but more\nlikely to be blocked due to apoptosis, cell proliferation and apoptosis caused by\nimbalance (Bhattacharjee et al., 2001; Sun and\nLiu, 2008). Cell accumulation and aggressive\ndevelopment of viable cells into tumors will occur if cell apoptosis fails (Hoeppner\net al., 1996).\n\nCaco-2 cells are derived from human colonic adenocarcinoma cells, which can be\nspontaneously epithelized and closely linked with the culture environments.\nMorphological and functional expression of the marker enzymes are similar to those\nof human intestinal mucosa (Bonnesen et al., 2001). In present study, the triggering of Caco-2 apoptosis by the GI\ndigests has been successfully evaluated. To determine the dose of GI digests, we\nused the method of CCK-8 to calculate the IC50 value (5.75 mg/mL) and most of the\napoptosis in late apoptotic was highlighted. Therefore, the digests of the preserved\neggs may play an important role in the late stage of apoptosis in terms of the\ntriggering.\n\nCaspase-3 is an important regulatory proteases involved in multiple signaling\npathways such as p38 and JAK-STAT (Dass\u00e9 et al., 2007; Lanvin et al., 2004). As a pro-apoptotic protein, the activity of caspase-3 was\nsignificantly upregulated in Caco-2 cells after treated with preserved egg digests\ncompared to the control group. Anti-cancer drugs, hormonal preparations,\nradiotherapy, etc., are generally induced by the induction of apoptosis of the cells\nto achieve the purpose of treatment. Therefore, triggering of cell apoptosis has\nbecome the main treatment for anti-tumor purpose (Hong and Sporn, 1997; Kelloff et al., 2000). This suggests that preserved egg digests could be used\nin the medical field cause it could inhibit cancer by inducing the apoptosis of\nCaco-2 cells.\n\nThe current research on the preserved eggs has been limited on the effect of diverse\nprocessing methods and quality modification but is not involved in the functional\nproperties changes. The main results in present study showed that the preserved eggs\ncould inhibit the release of inflammatory factors and induce apoptosis of tumor\ncells. Moreover, from nutritional aspect, it was also interesting that the preserved\neggs possessed effective antilipemic capacity as evidence by the lipid level in\nrat\u2019s liver. In conclusion, the preserved eggs may play a potential role in\nhuman health and can be developed as a kind of functional food in the future. Our\nnext investigation would be focus on the relationship between preserved eggs and\nantilipemic capacity and its mechanism of action. Furthermore, characterization of\nactive substances derived from the preserved eggs such as functional peptides are\nalso deserved to be investigated to give more insights into the structure-activity\nrelationship in a nutritional and functional level."}
