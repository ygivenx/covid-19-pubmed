{"title": "Invasive bacterial infections following influenza: a time\u2010series analysis in Montr\u00e9al, Canada, 1996\u20132008", "body": "We studied all laboratory\u2010confirmed cases of invasive S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae and N. meningitidis infection among residents of Montr\u00e9al, Canada, notified to the Public Health Department of the Montr\u00e9al Health and Social Services Agency between 1 January 1996 and 7 June 2008 (with the exception of S. pneumoniae, whose notification began on January 5, 1997). The notifications of each infection were aggregated into weekly case counts. Numbers of positive influenza A and B test results for residents of Montr\u00e9al during the same period were provided by the Qu\u00e9bec Public Health Laboratory from a sentinel laboratory surveillance network database and were similarly aggregated into weekly influenza A or B counts. The number of hospital laboratories in the sentinel network varied from six in 1996 to seven in 2008, with a stable core of five laboratories throughout the study period. Testing practices changed after the introduction of commercial rapid tests in 1996 and after improvement in the access to antiviral drugs, contributing to an overall increase in the total number of positive results.\n\nA binary indicator variable (short work week) was created to identify weeks that include fewer than five working days, when fewer notifications are to be expected, because non\u2010emergency medical care is less accessible or notification is delayed. About 6 weeks per year include other holidays that were not taken into account because their dates vary from year to year and could not be recovered.\n\nDescriptive analyses used frequency distribution histograms, correlation matrices and time series of counts. Modelling of the bacterial infection counts used multivariate negative binomial regression, rather than Poisson regression, because it does not require the variance of observations to be equal to their mean. The parameters \u03b2i of the models are most easily understood after transformation into incidence rate ratios (IRR). The IRR for any predictor x\ni is equal to e\n\u03b2i; it represents the ratio of the expected value of the count when x\ni is in the model over its expected value when x\ni is not in the model. If x\ni is an influenza count, the IRR is the ratio of the risk associated with a count of x\ni + 1 compared to the risk for a count of x\ni; the IRR for a count of x\ni + n compared to x\ni is IRRn.\n\nOverall trends in the time series of counts were accounted for by including in the model restricted cubic spline terms to remove long\u2010term (secular) trends, and sine\u2010cosine (periodic) terms to remove seasonal trends.\n28\n The restricted cubic spline function used had six knots \n29\n and therefore five parameters,\n30\n referred to as spline1\u2013spline5. The small number of knots was chosen so that the spline terms would reflect only the long\u2010time trends, while the periods for the sine\u2010cosine terms were 1 year, plus the first five harmonics (1/2 year, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6) to account for seasonality and any <1 year periodicities. Periodic terms had the forms sin(xt) and cos(xt), where x = 1 to 6 and t = (2\u03c0 \u00d7 week number \u00d7 12.438)/649; the week number ranged from 1 to 649, representing 12.438 years, the length of our time series of counts.\n\nComparisons of the overall closeness\u2010of\u2010fit of nested models (all the terms in the smaller model being included in the larger model) used the deviance (\u22122 \u00d7 difference between log\u2010likelihoods), tested by chi\u2010square. The deviance served as an overall test of whether a model including a set of terms (for instance the influenza counts) is statistically superior to the same model without these terms.\n\nAs any effect of influenza on the risk of subsequent bacterial infections should occur within a few weeks,\n11\n, \n14\n, \n15\n and relying on preliminary results, we decided to estimate the effects on the bacterial infection counts for any given week (called week 0) of influenza counts for the same week and for the five preceding weeks (called weeks \u22121 to \u22125).\n\nAll analyses were carried out with stata 10.1 (Stata Corp., Cary, NC, USA). The data used are all publicly available aggregate surveillance results, and no ethical review was required.\n\nDuring the study period, there were 3027 positive tests for influenza A, with a mean weekly count of 4.664 (range 0\u201385) and 745 positive tests for influenza B (mean: 1.148, range 0\u201333). There were 107 infections caused by H. influenzae (mean: 0.165, variance: 0.212), 156 by N. meningitidis (mean: 0.240, var.: 0.248), 2920 by S. pneumoniae (over the last 596 weeks, mean: 4.899, var.: 11.190) and 667 by S. pyogenes (mean 1.028, var.: 1.292). Weekly bacterial infection counts were roughly Poisson distributed, but variances being consistently larger than means justified the choice of negative binomial regression.\n\nThe time series of influenza A and B counts (Figure 1) shows that type B varies proportionately more from year to year than type A and usually peaks some weeks later. The smoothed N. meningitidis and H. influenzae counts (Figure 2) show a seasonality that is irregular in period and amplitude; in addition, H. influenzae counts increased markedly between 2003 and 2004, when all invasive H. influenzae infections became reportable, not only those of type B. The smoothed S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes counts (Figure 3) show yearly peaks that are particularly marked for S. pneumoniae; however, the peaks are not synchronous, those for S. pyogenes tending to occur later in the year.\n\nCorrelations between weekly influenza counts and later bacterial counts were generally high, as expected (results not shown), but the corresponding IRR adjusted for short work weeks, long\u2010term and seasonal trends, in Table 1, show much weaker associations. Only two IRR, between influenza B and subsequent S. pyogenes infections, approach significance.\n\nThe full model for influenza B and S. pyogenes, in Table 2, shows several effects, all adjusted for each other. (i) Short work weeks are associated with a 27% decrease [(1\u22120.7337)*100] in S. pyogenes notifications. (ii) The large coefficient for sine1 reflects the yearly notification peaks, but there is also a weaker six\u2010monthly (cosine2) and two\u2010monthly (cosine6) periodicity. (iii) All the long\u2010term\u2010trend terms are highly significant. (iv) Influenza B counts for a given week (week 0) are associated with increases in S. pyogenes notifications in the same week and in the following one (weeks 0 and +1), of about 3.8% [(1.0376\u22121)*100] and 3.5% [(1.0354\u22121)*100] per additional positive influenza B test, respectively. They are also associated, although not statistically significantly, with decreases in S. pyogenes notifications in weeks +2 to +5. These two phenomena together are suggestive of \u2018harvesting\u2019\n31\n, \n32\n: at least some of the S. pyogenes infections following influenza B would have occurred even without influenza, but a few weeks later, having merely been brought forward in time by influenza B. However, a model containing influenza B counts for all 6 weeks does not show a better fit than one containing only the counts for weeks 0 and \u22121 (deviance = 6.96, P = 0.1381), indicating that this apparent \u2018harvesting\u2019 of cases may well be in fact random variations in the parameters. (Note that the N. meningitidis terms marked c and d in Table 1, although large and almost significant, are in the wrong sequence for harvesting, which is why they are not reported as a finding.)\n\nThe comparison of observed and expected S. pyogenes counts before and after influenza counts are added to the model (4, 5) shows a visible improvement in fit. A comparison of the two dark lines shows that, with influenza B in the model, four transient increases in S. pyogenes infections are now modelled that were not before: those in 1997, 2001, 2007 and especially 2008. Looking back at the time series of influenza B counts (dark line in Figure 1), one notes that these were years with late, high peaks in the weekly numbers of influenza B\u2010positive tests. An additional indication that this association may be causal is that the average age of known influenza B cases in these 4 years is significantly higher, 33.9 years, than in other years, 24.6 years (P < 0.000), and closer to the average ages of S. pyogenes cases, 45.9 years.\n\nComparisons of the closeness\u2010of\u2010fit of various nested models quantify rigorously the relative contributions of long\u2010term trends, seasonal trends and influenza (Table 3). All infections except those caused by N. meningitidis display significant long\u2010term trends (model 1), and both streptococcal infections also show significant seasonality (model 2). These findings confirm what has been observed in Figure 3. When long\u2010term trends but not seasonality are controlled for (models 3 and 4), influenza A and B counts significantly improve the model fit for both streptococcal infections, but the improvement is greater for S. pneumoniae than for S. pyogenes. When seasonality is also controlled for by dedicated terms, however, the only effect remaining is that of influenza B counts on S. pyogenes counts, as mentioned earlier (models 5 and 6). This effect remains essentially the same if one uses Poisson regression, includes earlier S. pyogenes counts in the model, splines with five or seven knots, or fewer harmonics for the periodic functions (results not shown).\n\nAssociations between two phenomena that share a seasonal pattern are intrinsically difficult to interpret as causal because one can rarely exclude that they are both consequences of other phenomena displaying the same pattern (a form of confounding). Our analyses shows that such associations may well disappear once confounding by long\u2010term or seasonal trends has been controlled. We submit that the associations that have resisted such control provide the clearest information about true effects, in the absence of data on specific confounders. This may be especially true if these associations can be attributed to particular deviations from the usual patterns, as observed in explaining the differences between 4, 5 by means of Figure 1. Our results illustrate that the opportunities provided by modelling aberrations are different from those provided by modelling regularities: in Table 2, had the observed seasonality of S. pyogenes always been that predicted by the seasonal trend terms, no IRR for influenza B would have emerged as significant.\n\nThe S. pyogenes count for any given week is multiplied by 1.0376 for each additional influenza B\u2010positive test result that same week and by 1.0354 for the same increase the preceding week (Table 1). The combined effect of both weeks is the product of these IRR, 1.0743. The average weekly influenza B count being 1.1479, its effect over these 2 weeks is to multiply the S. pyogenes case count by 1.07431.1479 = 1.0858, an 8.6% increase. With an average of 59 S. pyogenes cases per year in Montr\u00e9al, this represents about five extra cases every year.\n\nAll the estimates in the previous paragraph are approximations, being valid only to the extent that numbers of positive influenza B tests are a constant proportion of all incident cases of the disease. The reported incidence of invasive bacterial infections better reflects their true incidence, especially for those caused by N. meningitidis and S. pyogenes, because of their severity and their requiring an urgent public health intervention.\n\nOther limitations include delays in the measurement of the variables. Ideally, one would use time series of dates of acquisition of all infections under study. In reality, for influenza we had the dates when the specimens were taken, and for the bacterial infections the dates when notifications reached the public health department (as this is the only date we have for all notified cases). Thus, the effects observed over weeks 0 and \u22121 probably occurred after only a few days, because the median delay between onset of symptoms because of S. pyogenes infection and its notification is 6 days, in the 489 cases for which it is known.\n\nAnother limitation in estimating the effects of influenza is the lack of control for (i) confounding by other triggering factors for invasive S. pyogenes infections, such as varicella and respiratory syncytial virus infections, temperature or humidity levels, and (ii) the variations in predominant influenza B subtype or in vaccine formulation and uptake. Point ii) might explain why the 2005 influenza B peak was not followed by a S. pyogenes peak. Effect modification, especially by age, also remains to be investigated: because of our relatively small bacterial infection counts, an age\u2010stratified analysis would have resulted in losing too much statistical power.\n\nFinally, because we tried to model all trends, secular or periodic, as much as possible through dedicated terms, the absence of significant effects of influenza A, or of effects on other bacterial infections than those because of S. pyogenes, does not mean such effects do not exist. These effects may simply be so similar in strength and timing to the overall effects modelled by periodic and spline terms that their contributions are entirely subsumed by these terms.\n\nBoth types of influenza have been associated with secondary infections and an increased risk of mortality,\n33\n but the risk associated with type B has been less well documented than for type A. There are a few reports concerning the association of influenza B with unspecified or pneumococcal pneumonia, or other respiratory infections,\n34\n, \n35\n, \n36\n, \n37\n, \n38\n fewer with S. pyogenes infections,\n39\n, \n40\n, \n41\n and no attempt, to our knowledge, to quantify any of these associations.\n\nThe demonstration of a specific contribution of influenza B to the occurrence of invasive S. pyogenes infections, which include the widely feared \u2018flesh eating disease\u2019, reinforces the case for immunizing against influenza. There is already experimental evidence in mice that influenza A vaccine protects against S. pyogenes superinfection,\n42\n and influenza immunization has been recommended as protection against bacterial superinfections in humans,\n14\n including those caused by S. pyogenes.\n\n43\n, \n44\n Our rough estimate of the proportion of S. pyogenes infections in the general population attributable to influenza B (8%) is understandably smaller than the 50\u201377% preventable by influenza immunization among army trainees,\n45\n among whom the infection pressure for both diseases is very high. Yet, its greater generalizability provides additional support for the recent recommendation to immunize all persons aged \u2265 6 months against influenza.\n46\n The ability of invasive S. pyogenes infections to cripple or kill previously healthy adults makes even partial protection against them an appreciable argument in the promotion of universal influenza vaccination."}
