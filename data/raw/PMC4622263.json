{"title": "Molecular Epidemiology of Hospital Outbreak of Middle East\nRespiratory Syndrome, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 2014", "body": "KFMC is a 1,200-bed tertiary care hospital in Riyadh that comprises 4 hospitals\nand 4 medical centers on 1 campus. The main hospital is affiliated with\nspecialized women\u2019s, children\u2019s, and rehabilitation hospitals. The\n4 centers are the National Neuroscience, Heart, Oncology, and Diabetes centers.\nThe main hospital, affiliated hospitals, and centers provide nationwide referral\nservices. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of KFMC. \n\nThe emergency department (ED) is located on the ground floor of KFMC. It accepts\npatients from throughout Saudi Arabia; in 2014, there were 139,173 recorded\nvisits. Time in the ED is usually brief, but some patients might have extended\nED stays depending on availability of isolation rooms in the wards.\n\nMedical wards (MWs) MW-C and MW-D, which have 50 beds combined (Technical Appendix 1 Figure 1), are\nlocated in the main hospital and admit patients from the ED, outpatient clinics,\nand referrals from elsewhere in Saudi Arabia. Most rooms in these 2 adjacent\nwards have 4 beds. However, MW-C has 6 isolation rooms, 2 with negative pressure\nventilation, and MW-D has 4 isolation rooms, none with negative pressure\nventilation. Patients are occasionally moved between the 2 wards, but nurses\nwork only in their assigned wards.\n\nPatients, including HCWs, confirmed to have MERS diagnosed at KFMC during\nFebruary 1\u2013May 31, 2014, composed the study population. Nasopharyngeal\nswab specimens and tracheal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavages were collected\nfor viral diagnosis. A case of MERS, according to the Saudi Arabian Ministry of\nHealth definition, was fever and acute respiratory illness in a patient who had\na positive test result for MERS-CoV infection. Criteria for investigation of\npatients and HCW for MERS-CoV is provided in Technical Appendix 1.\n\nA reverse transcription PCR diagnostic kit (MERS-Coronavirus EMC Orf1a and SA1\nEMC upstream E-gene, Light Mix Modular Assays; TIB MOLBIOL, Adelphia, NJ, USA,\nand Roche, Mannheim, Germany) was used for the screening and confirmation of\nMERS-CoV infection. Each sample was also tested simultaneously for 15\nrespiratory viruses (influenza A and B; parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, and 4;\nrespiratory syncytial virus; adenovirus; enterovirus; human metapneumovirus;\nhuman coronaviruses 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU-1; and human bocavirus) by using\nthe Seeplex RV15 ACE Detection Kit (Seegene Inc., Seoul, South Korea). Samples\nfrom the early phase of the outbreak were tested for MERS-CoV at the Ministry of\nHealth laboratories; midway into the outbreak, KFMC developed in-house MERS-CoV\ntesting capability.\n\nPatient demographics and epidemiologic data on study participants were collected\nby retrospective chart review, from electronic health records, and from leave or\nsick leave records of staff. Patients with confirmed cases of MERS were\nspatiotemporally mapped within the hospital. Additional contact histories were\nobtained through direct interviews with the infected HCWs or patients. On the\nbasis of date of hospital attendance or admission, date of onset of illness, and\nreported incubation period for MERS (median 5 days, range 2\u201314 days)\n(9), the patients\nwere classified into those acquiring infection outside KFMC (externally\nacquired), long-term patients acquiring infection while at KFMC (long-term\npatients) and HCWs working at the hospital. HCWs were presumed to have acquired\nnosocomial infections at KFMC, although infection outside the hospital could not\nbe excluded.\n\nPotential transmission links were identified on the basis of patients or HCW\npresent or working in the same ward or ED concurrently with a MERS patient.\nGiven the retrospective nature of this study, it was not possible to assess\nwhether HCW exposures occurred without use of adequate personal protective\nequipment (PPE).\n\ncDNA was synthesized by using gene-specific primers for different regions of the\nMERS-CoV genome and subsequently subjected to multiple sets of PCR that covered\nthe entire virus genome (primers available on request). Overlapping PCR products\ngenerated were sequenced by using MERS-CoV\u2013specific primers. Sequences\n(without primer sequences) were aligned and assembled by using Geneious version\n8.0.5 (http://www.geneious.com). Genomes were sequenced with\n>3\u20135 times coverage.\n\nA time-resolved phylogenetic tree was estimated from a concatenated gene\nalignment of MERS-CoV genome by using BEAST version 1.8 (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/). Analysis was conducted by using a\ngeneral time-reversible model and gamma-distributed sites with separate rates\nfor the 3 codon positions under a relaxed lognormal clock model.\n\nThe number of specimen tested for MERS-CoV in March, April, and May 2014, were 3,\n222 and 1,731, respectively, increasingly markedly during the course of the\noutbreak. During the study period, 45 patients at KFMC had virologically\nconfirmed MERS. Eight of these patients had externally acquired infections, and\n13 long-term hospitalized patients had nosocomial infections; 23 HCWs had\nMERS-CoV infections, presumably acquired at KFMC. Patient EA-9 (disease onset\nMay 5, first ED visit May 1) might have been infected either at KFMC or at an\nexternal source.\n\nEnhanced surveillance identified 4 asymptomatically infected HCWs. Disease onset\ndates of different patient groups are shown in Figure 1. Thirteen patients died of their infections: 3 of 8\npatients with externally acquired infections, 9 of 14 long-term hospitalized\npatients, and 1 of 23 HCWs. MERS-CoV\u2013infected HCWs had a median age of\n35.5 years (range 24\u201358 years); non-HCWs had a median age of 60 years\n(range 12\u201377 years) (p<0.005). Demographic characteristics of all\npatients and work locations of infected HCWs are shown in Technical Appendix 1 Table 1.\n\nTo investigate virus introduction and intrahospital transmission pathways,\navailable archived respiratory specimens from 15 patients who had high viral\nloads were obtained and genetically analyzed. Whole-genome sequences were\nobtained from 10 patients and a partial genome was obtained from 1 patient\n(Table; Technical Appendix 1 Table 2) (GenBank accession nos.\nKT121572\u2013KT121581 and KT202801).\n\nA time-resolved phylogenetic tree (Figure 2)\nshows whole-genome sequences from these 10 patients within the context of other\navailable MERS-CoV whole-genome sequences. Nodes A, B, and C have strong\nstatistical support in this time-resolved phylogeny and in a separate\nmaximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of these same sequences (aBayes branch\nsupport) (10).\nPhylogenetic analysis suggests that patients at KFMC were part of a larger\noutbreak of MERS that was ongoing in Riyadh at that time, involving, but perhaps\nnot limited to, other hospitals, such as PSMMC and King Khalid University\nHospital (KKUH). The dated phylogeny suggests that a putative zoonotic event\n(node A in Figure 2) occurred on\napproximately December 31, 2013 (95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval\nNovember 8, 2013\u2013February 10, 2014), although the possibility of separate\nzoonotic events for closely related viruses cannot be excluded.\n\nVirus isolate KFMC-9 clusters phylogenetically with viruses from KKUH and\nseparately with other viruses from KFMC. This isolate has a signature mutation\n(C26144T KFMC-9) that is also present in KKUH-90b, KKUH-291, and KKUH-368\nisolates, indicating that patient from which this virus was isolated was\ninfected with a virus related to those in the ongoing outbreak at KKUH (Figure 3; Technical Appendix 2). The ancestral node B has strong\nstatistical support (posterior density >0.95) and an\nestimated date of January 28, 2014 (95% HPD interval December 16,\n2013\u2013February 27, 2014), which is long before the date of onset of the\nfirst known case of MERS at KFMC (March 29, 2014) (Table). Node C in the dated phylogeny (Figure 2) also has strong statistical support, and an\nestimated date for this node was February 15 (HPD interval January\n10\u2013March 16) which is also before the date of disease onset of the first\nknown patient in the outbreak at KFMC. Thus, it is likely that there were\nmultiple introductions of MERS-CoV to KFMC to account for the observed virus\ngenetic diversity in the patients studied at KFMC.\n\nViruses in node A in the phylogenetic tree have a nucleotide substitution rate of\n6.54 \u00d7 10\u22124 nt substitutions/site/year (genome length\nanalyzed 29,897 kb), which is comparable to a previously reported value of 6.3\n\u00d7 10\u20134 (5). Estimated ancestral sequence at nodes C and\nE (identical) in the dated phylogenetic tree and nucleotide substitutions\nobserved in virus sequences obtained in this study, together with virus\nsequences from patients in KKUH and PSMMC hospitals that appear to be related to\nthis outbreak, are shown in Figure 3 and\nTechnical Appendix 2.\n\nWe tested the hypothesis that KFMC-7, KFMC-8, and KFMC-10 viruses diverged from\nthe ancestral virus after April 5, 2014, the date that patient EA-1 came to the\nER. Observed nucleotide differences were greater than would be expected if\nKFMC-7, KFMC-8, and KFMC-10 diverged at KFMC after April 5, suggesting that\n>1 of these 3 viruses were transmitted separately\nto KFMC (Technical Appendix 1 Table\n3). Conversely, KFMC-1\u20136 viruses had expected mutation rates, in\naccordance with observed phylogeny. Node E (including viruses KFMC-1\u20136)\nwas less robust, but had an estimated date of April 4 (HPD interval March\n9\u2013April 25), which as an entry point for transmission at KFMC is more\nplausible with observed epidemiologic data. Viruses KFMC 1\u20136 had\n<1 nt difference between them for 29,897 nt\nsequenced, and the zoonotic time span between the oldest and newest virus\nspecimens was 20 days (Technical Appendix\n2). The partial genome sequence for KFMC-11 is also identical with\nthat of KFMC-1\u20136 or KFMC-7. However, this partial sequence, although\n5,225 nt, cannot optimally resolve transmission pathways.\n\nWard locations and patient data are shown in Technical Appendix 1 Figure 2, and layout of key wards is\nshown in Technical Appendix 1\nFigure 1. Before admission to KFMC, patient EA-1, the first patient to be\nidentified during the outbreak at KFMC, had regularly visited his father, who\nwas hospitalized at PSMMC, where a MERS outbreak was ongoing.\n\nOn the basis of known incubation periods, onset of illness, and presence at the\nsame location (Technical Appendix 1\nFigure 2), the ER was a plausible venue for MERS-CoV transmission from patient\nEA-1 to KFMC-0 and from patient KFMC-0 to patient KFMC-1. Patients KFMC-0 and\nKFMC-1 were co-workers in the ER, and patient KFMC-1 provided care for patient\nKFMC-0 when she was ill in the ER. Patient KFMC-1 also provided care for patient\nKFMC-0 without PPE in the staff quarters when she was on sick leave (April 15).\nThere were no archived specimens from patients EA-1 and KFMC-0. Patient KFMC-1\nwas the first patient from this outbreak from whom we have virus genomic\ndata.\n\nPatient KFMC-0 was subsequently treated in MW-C where long-term patients KFMC-2\n(illness onset April 25), KFMC-4 (illness onset May 1), and KFMC-6 (illness\nonset May 6) became ill during April 4\u2013May 3 and were hospitalized, and\nviruses closely related to the virus from the KFMC-1 cluster (Technical Appendix 1 Figure 2) were\nisolated. Patient KFMC-3 was a chronically ill long-term patient in MW-C. A\nrespiratory infection developed, and infection with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus\nwas detected in respiratory specimens on April 27. She was discharged on April 4\nbut was readmitted on May 6 because of deteriorating respiratory function and\nwas subsequently given a diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection. Retesting of a\npredischarge respiratory specimen collected on April 30 showed MERS-CoV\ninfection. Thus, patient KFMC-3 probably had MERS a few days before the testing\ndate. However, the exact onset of illness could not be determined. Patient\nKFMC-3 used the intensive care unit bed previously used by patient EA-1 on April\n15.\n\nNurse KFMC-5, who worked in MW-D, had disease onset on May 3. Virus isolated from\nher specimen was closely related to the cluster of viruses isolated in MW-C.\nAlthough this nurse had no duties in MW-C, MW-C and MW-D are adjacent general\nmedical wards on the same hospital floor (Technical Appendix 1 Figure 1).\n\nGenetic analysis suggested that viruses from patient KFMC-9, KFMC-7, KFMC-8, and\nKFMC-10 were introduced separately into KFMC. Patient KFMC-9 worked in the ER\nand patients EA-6 and EA-3, who acquired MERS outside the hospital, were\nadmitted to the ER 4 and 11 days, respectively, before onset of disease in\npatient KFMC-9, which indicated that patients EA-6 and EA-3 were possible\nsources of infection for patient KFMC-9. Patient EA-2 was hospitalized in a\n4-bed room in MW-C where nurses KFMC-7 and KFMC-10 worked. In addition, patient\nKFMC-8 was a long-term patient in the same ward, which provided opportunities\nfor introduction of a genetically distinct virus (Technical Appendix 1 Figure 2).\n\nWe describe a hospital-associated outbreak of >45 MERS-CoV\ninfections that occurred at KFMC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, during March\u2013May\n2014. There appears to be a periodicity in peaks of transmission \u22487 days\napart, which is compatible with the known incubation period and case-to-case serial\ninterval reported to be 7.6 days (4).\n\nBefore this molecular epidemiologic study, the assumption was that the outbreak at\nKFMC was self-contained and originated from patient EA-1, independent of other\noutbreaks reported in Riyadh. Viral genomic data obtained during this study\ngenerated alternative hypotheses and show that the outbreak of KFMC was linked to\nongoing transmission within health care facilities in Riyadh at that time,\nincluding, but probably not limited to, PSMMC and KKUH. Data suggest a single\nzoonotic event that occurred around December 31, 2013 (95% HPD interval November 8,\n2013\u2013February 10, 2014), followed by transmission in health care facilities\nfor \u22485 months. However, an alternative possibility of multiple, independent\nspillover events from closely related viruses in a zoonotic reservoir cannot be\nexcluded. This chain of transmission was spread as far as Indiana in the United\nStates by an HCW from Riyadh (11) and 2 travelers returning to the Netherlands (12). Viral sequence data for\nviruses from the 2 travelers was fragmentary and excluded from phylogenetic\nanalysis. However, this cluster of human MERS-CoV in Riyadh was distinct from the\nlarge contemporaneous cluster of human-to-human transmission that occurred in Jeddah\nand represents a separate zoonotic transmission event (6). Only 1 of the analyzed sequences from the\nRiyadh cluster has an amino acid change in the receptor binding domain of the spike\nprotein (13), the C23, 697T\nnonsynonymous mutation in KFMC-8, which leads to an R\u2192C amino acid\nchange.\n\nIn this outbreak, 36 cases of MERS-CoV infection were putatively acquired through\nnosocomial transmission. However, given ongoing human-to-human transmission in\nRiyadh, it cannot be ruled out that some HCWs acquired infection from outside KFMC.\nMolecular epidemiology indicates 1 definite cluster of transmission associated with\nKFMC-1\u2013like viruses, which are genetically closely related (KFMC-1\u20136).\nThere are plausible epidemiologic links for transmission from patient EA-1, the\nfirst known patient admitted to KFMC in 2014, in the ER to patient KFMC-0, then to\npatient KFMC-1, and to patients KFMC-2\u2013KFMC-6. Because no virus sequence data\nwas available patients EA-1 or KFMC-0, the role of these 2 persons in the\ntransmission chain remains presumptive. The nearly identical virus genetic sequences\nfor KFMC-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -6 and plausible epidemiologic exposures provide\nmore definite pathways of transmission (Technical Appendix 1 Figure 2). Although virus KFMC-2 has 1 unique\nnucleotide substitution (T5321C), that sequence derives from a specimen collected\nlate in the patient\u2019s illness and might have originated in her after she\ntransmitted infection to patients KFMC-4 and KFMC-6.\n\nGenetic identity of virus KFMC-3 with viruses in the KFMC-1 cluster led to\nreassessment of the assumption that infection of patient KFMC-3 was externally\nacquired infection. Retesting of 2 archived (April 2014) specimens, 1 of which was\npositive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, showed that patient KFMC-3 was\nnosocomially infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and MERS-CoV before her\ndischarge on May 4, and this MERS-CoV was closely related to the KFMC-1 virus group.\nThe source of infection for patient KFMC-3 was unclear. This patient used the\nintensive care unit bed used by patient EA-1 on April 15, and patient KFMC-8\noccupied the isolation room vacated by patient EA-2, which raised the possibility of\nfomite transmission or transmission associated with HCW cases not detected by the\nsurveillance system.\n\nAlthough epidemiologic linkages would have led us to deduce that patient KFMC-9 may\nhave acquired infection from the KFMC-1 virus cluster, viral genetic analysis\nconclusively demonstrates that this was a separate introduction into KFMC through a\nperson with an externally acquired infection with a virus closely related to viruses\nat KKUH. Molecular epidemiology also demonstrated that virus KFMC-7, KFMC-8, and\nKFMC-10 were not linked to viruses in the KFMC-1 cluster, although there were\nplausible epidemiologic links with patients infected with viruses from the KFMC-1\ncluster. These 3 infections might have resulted from 1, 2, or 3 independent virus\nintroductions from outside KFMC.\n\nOur data suggest that the ER and MW-C at KFMC were major foci of transmission.\nAlthough findings are not conclusive, HCWs with mild upper respiratory illness who\ncontinued to work might have contributed to transmission. Many of these issues were\naddressed during and after this outbreak, including, but not limited to, enhancing\nawareness of MERS through electronic communication, establishing in-house capacity\nfor rapid MERS-CoV testing, active screening of KFMC staff who had influenza-like\nsymptoms through a dedicated influenza clinic, establishing a triage area for\npatients in the ED, designation of wards for isolation and screening of suspected\nMERS cases, and strengthening infection control practices among staff by mandatory\ntraining.\n\nOur study had limitations. Archived respiratory specimens from patients with MERS\nacquired outside KFMC (EA-1\u2013EA-9) were unavailable for genomic analysis,\nwhich caused us to make assumptions in our putative chains of transmission. Some of\nthe retrospectively retrieved epidemiologic data were obtained through interviews\nwith HCWs and patients 1 year after the outbreak. For example, data on PPE use and\nextent of exposure to individual MERS-infected patients was difficult to establish\nwith confidence. Thus, risk factors or modes of transmission (i.e., roles of large\nor small droplets, contact) could not be established. Dates and ward locations of\npatients and staff were available from the electronic medical record systems at\nKFMC, and we relied on proximity analysis (e.g., patients being co-housed in the\nsame ward or nursed by the same nursing team members as other known patients with\nMERS) to provide epidemiologic context to the molecular epidemiologic data.\n\nIn summary, we provide molecular epidemiologic data derived from complete virus\ngenome genetic analysis that is suggestive of a large MERS outbreak involving\nmultiple health care facilities in Riyadh, suggesting ongoing human-to-human\ntransmission over many months. Using molecular analysis supplemented by available\nepidemiologic data, we identified MERS-CoV transmission within a large health care\nfacility and demonstrated the feasibility and value of complete viral genome\nsequence analysis in outbreak investigations. We showed that what was seemingly a\ncontiguous outbreak within KFMC was caused by multiple introductions of virus from\noutside the hospital. The small number of mutations observed across the 29,897-nt\ngenome analyzed during this outbreak emphasizes the need for complete genome\nanalysis if molecular epidemiology is to be meaningful in such settings. The ongoing\noutbreak of MERS in South Korea (2), the largest cluster of transmission from a\nreturning traveler to date, highlights the ongoing threat from MERS and the need for\nunderstanding pathways of transmission. Detailed molecular epidemiology can\ncontribute to these efforts and thus help minimize transmission."}
