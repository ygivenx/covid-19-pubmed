{"title": "The Digestive System THE ORAL CAVITY", "body": "The oral cavity of the young dog and cat is easily examined; its examination should be consistent and systematic and include inspection and palpation of the gingiva, teeth, tongue, lingual frenulum, floor of the mouth, buccal surface, and hard and soft palates. In a young puppy or kitten, the right hand can be easily replaced by a moistened cotton-tipped applicator to accommodate the animal's smaller oral cavity. The healthy oral cavity is generally pink with a scattering of pigment, appears smooth and glistening, and has limited accumulation of secretions. The surface tissue is pliable and easily blanched with light touch. Gentle opening and palpation of the oral cavity should not be painful or cause prompt withdrawal of the head. Consequently, a painful reaction or inability to fully open the mouth should be obvious. The breath of a growing, healthy dog or cat is not unpleasant; the breath of nursing puppies or kittens generally has a characteristic milky smell. Alterations in the odor of the breath usually indicate a disease state, food the animal has eaten, or medication it has received. Offensive, foul-smelling breath may be caused by oral lesions, necrotic respiratory disease, or alimentary tract disease associated with belching. Periodontal disease is not as likely in the young dog or cat to cause bad breath. Teeth should always be inspected and the number of teeth and their arrangement within the dental arcade evaluated at each examination. The occlusal pattern of the jaws and teeth should also be examined regardless of the animal's age.\n\nThe ingestive and masticatory functions of the oral cavity depend largely on the ability of the oral cavity to form a closed, hollow compartment, requiring labial and palatal competence. Most anatomic or functional disturbances of the oral cavity may to varying degrees disrupt fluid or food ingestion and/or interfere with the mastication of food. Cleft palate, cleft lip, or other causes of altered competence of the oral cavity should be identified during the oral examination. In addition, observation of eating, drinking, licking, and yawning helps to identify such disturbances.\n\nAny infectious, physical, or chemical agent or traumatic insult that significantly alters the replication, maturation, or exfoliation of the healthy mucosa favors the occurrence of stomatitis (Table 10-1) .\n\nViral Stomatitis. Feline rhinotracheitis virus (FRV) and feline calicivirus (FCV) cause most of the oral lesions seen in young cats (Scott, 1986) . Buccal, lingual, and nasal ulcers frequently accompany these viral respiratory infections, although ulcers are generally more severe in FCV than in FRV infections. Feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus may also be associated with oral lesions as a persistent glossitis, periodontitis, palatitis, and/ or gingivitis, presumably because of virusinduced immunosuppression (Pedersen et al, 1987) . Canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus type 2, and feline parvovirus (feline panleukopenia virus) may cause stomatitis also, although these viruses typically produce more severe symptoms referable to other organ systems. Because oral lesions from most viral infec- Physical Agent-Induced Stomatitis. Foreign objects frequently cause traumatic insult to the oral mucosa of young dogs and cats, probably owing to the animals' curious natures and normal developmental chewing habits. The ani mal generally presents in varying phases of recovery, with secondary bacterial infection and scar tissue often camouflaging the foreign object(s). Removal of the foreign objectrs) usually effects a cure. Intermittent problems from migrating grass awns or porcupine quills may be eliminated only by thorough dissection of irritated tissue. Traumatic injury to the tongue, palate, or lips is common, and the original wound is often aggravated by secondary bacterial infections. Oral burns from electrical cords are especially common in young dogs and cats that chew through the insulation of the cords. Pulmonary edema, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias frequently accompany these electrical shock injuries.\n\nChemical Agent-Induced Stomatitis. Oral lesions from ingestion of caustic or corrosive substances are uncommon. When they occur, immediate, liberal flushing of the mouth with copious amounts of water should be done. Generally, chemical neutralization with homemade antidotes is ineffective because of the delay from time of exposure to presentation of the animal to the veterinarian. Continual exposure to chemicals, especially pesticides, fertilizers, and irritant plants, in the environment may cause severe oral lesions, which is more common in rural settings. Supportive care includes cleansing and occasional debridement of the oral lesions, treatment of secondary bacterial infection, and frequent feeding of a nutritionally complete, soft, palatable diet to ensure adequate caloric intake.\n\nImmune-Mediated Stomatitis. In the immune-mediated diseases (i.e., pemphigus diseases, bullous pemphigoid, and lupus erythematosus), it is unusual in either the dog or cat for oral lesions to occur without skin involvement, especially at other mucocutaneous junctions, such as eyelids, nostrils, anus, vagina, and prepuce (Scott et ai, 1987a, b) . In pemphigus vulgaris, the presence of autoantibodies to intercellular epidermal antigens causes acantholysis and intraepidermal vesicobullous ulceration of the skin and oral cavity. Pemphigus foliaceus, the most common of the pemphigus diseases, rarely affects the oral cavity. In bullous pemphigoid, the presence of autoantibodies against antigens at the basement membrane zone causes subepidermal vesicobullous ulceration of the skin and oral cavity. In systemic lupus erythematosus, oral ulceration may occur in conjunction with its other multisystemic manifestations. Any of these immune-mediated diseases may first ap-pear in the dog or cat at 4 to 6 months of age and typically follow the same lesion(s) development and patterns as seen in the adult. Their treatment follows the same regimens as used for the adult.\n\nFeline Lymphoplasmacytic Stomatitis. Lymphoplasmaeytic stomatitis commonly affects young to middle-aged cats, but a cat as young as 4 months of age may be affected. Calicivirus has been isolated from some affected cats. The definitive cause of the oral lesions is unknown, but an immunologic basis has been suspected. Abyssinian and Somali are commonly affected cat breeds. Lymphoplasmaeytic stomatitis typically follows the same lesion(s) development (i.e., small erythemic papules to severe mucosal proliferation of gingiva and/or palatal arches) as seen in the adult cat. Cytologic examination of biopsy material or deep scrapings will show mucosal hyperplasia with large numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells and variable numbers of neutrophils and macrophages. Oral lesion(s) treatment follows the same regimens as used for the adult.\n\nOther Causes. Mineral and vitamin deficiencies, heavy-metal poisoning, and coagulation abnormalities may also cause oral lesions. Black tongue, caused by niacin deficiency in dogs, is no longer seen as a clinical entity (Dillon, 1980) . Although rarely seen, deficiencies in many of the B-complex vitamins and possibly in zinc may contribute to the appearance of oral lesions in growing, malnourished dogs or cats (Lewis et al, 1987; Lyon, 1988) . Thallium is generally the heavy-metal cause of oral lesions. Petechiation of the oral mucosa or gingival bleeding may occur with coagulation abnormalities, that is, rodenticide poisoning, thrombocytopenia, clotting factor deficiencies, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Silver-gray collies affected with cyclic hematopoiesis often develop a recurrent stomatitis that coincides with absolute neutropenia (Cheville, 1968) . Proliferative eosinophilic granulomas have been seen in the oral cavity of Siberian huskies and in many breeds of young cats (i.e., in kittens as young as 8 weeks of age) (Madewell et al, 1980; Potter et aI, 1980) . General Therapy. The definitive cause of a stomatitis cannot always be determined by history, physical examination, cytologic examination, bacterial and fungal culture, or tissue biopsy. In many cases, bacterial cultures reveal the normal mixed flora of the oral cavity (Table  10 -2); therefore, antimicrobial sensitivities are The Digestive System I 149 Bacteria Commonly Isolated From the Oral Cavity often unreliable. In these cases, therapy to treat the symptoms is often efficacious. A gauze sponge can be used for mechanical cleaning of the mucosal surface. Daily flushing of the mouth with chlorhexidine (diluted to 0.1 % to 0.2% solution in tepid water) followed by rinsing the mouth with copious amounts of fresh water will help cleanse the affected areas. Soft, palatable food may need to be provided for several days during the initial healing phase. Ampicillin, amoxicillin, or cephalosporins may be administered daily in an oral liquid form for both a local antimicrobial effect and subsequent systemic effect after absorption. Antimicrobial therapy may be indicated for up to 3 weeks.\n\nA high degree of variability exists in the cleft palate-eleft lip complex. The cleft lip usually occurs as a unilateral defect in the lip or in the floor of the nostril (Figs. 10-1 and 10-2) and is occasionally seen in conjunction with cleft palate. Thorough examination of the nostril is required to identify an extension of the defect into the nasal passage. Cleft palate may be identified as offset palatal rugae on the roof of the oral cavity, incomplete fusion of the soft palate, or an oronasal fistula through a cleft palate. The incidence of cleft palate-cleft lip complex is higher in brachycephalic dog breeds (e.g., Boston terrier and Pekingese), although other breeds (e.g., schnauzer, Labrador retriever, cocker spaniel, dachshund, and German shepherd) have a high incidence (jurkiewicz and Bryant, 1968) . Cleft palate may also be seen in young cats, especially the Siamese, Abyssinian, and Manx breeds (Saperstein et al, 1976; Wardrip, 1982) .\n\nThe cause of the cleft palate-cleft lip complex may be congenital or inherited. Administration of corticosteroids, metronidazole, or griseofulvin and metabolic disturbances during pregnancy are incriminated as the primary causes of congenital cleft palate-cleft lip com- plex (Dillon, 1980) . The inheritance pattern of the complex is a simple recessive or irregular dominant trait. Signs associated with cleft palate vary with the extent of the defect and may include poor growth; drainage of milk from the nostrils during and after nursing; coughing, gagging, and sneezing while eating; and recurrent respiratory tract infections. Aspiration pneumonia is a common sequela in most severely affected animals. Tube-feeding is an effective method of providing adequate nutrition to the most severely affected animals until repair of palatal defects is possible.\n\nSurgical repair of the complex should not be attempted until the puppy or kitten is 7 to 9 weeks of age. A temporary prosthesis made of acrylic resins can be used to cover the defect until surgical repair is possible (Dillon, 1986) . During this delay in surgical closure, the cleft in the hard palate often decreases in width, making more tissue available for reconstruction. The tissue also has more time to mature and gain better holding strength, and there is more operative room in the small oral cavity. Surgical techniques for repair of cleft palate-cleft lip complex are described elsewhere (Pope and Constantinescu, 1998) . Multiple surgical procedures may be necessary for complete restoration of palatal defects. Although minor mucosal or soft palate defects are compatible with life, the affected animals should not be used for breeding purposes.\n\nPapillomas. Oral papillomas are caused by papillomavirus, commonly occur in dogs The Digestive System I 151 younger than 1 year of age, and may spread through a kennel in 2 to 4 weeks. The cauliflower-like growths begin as smooth, creamcolored elevations, which later become rough and gray ( Fig. 10-3) . Histologically, a thick squamous epithelium covers branching cords of dermal papillae. The oral mucosa and commissures of the lips are most commonly affected (Bredal et al, 1996) . The number and size of lesions are variable. Although usually not necessary, a biopsy may be required with early atypical lesions or hyperpigmented, contracted lesions that form during regression (Dillon, 1986) . In most cases, therapy is usually unnecessary because the lesions regress spontaneously in 6 to 12 weeks. Surgical excision may be a means of stimulating regression and eliminating confluent pedunculated masses, which may impair the prehension and mastication of food. Lifetime immunity generally follows recovery.\n\nEpulides. Epulides are the most common benign oral tumors of dogs. They arise from the periodontal membrane, an origin that differentiates epulides from odontogenic tumors (Dubielzig et al, 1979) . The cause of epulides is unknown, but persistent inflammation and irritation are considered the primary inciting factors. Affected dogs are generally over 6 years old; however, an epulis may first appear at 4 to 6 months of age. The diagnosis and treatment in the younger dog generally follow the same approaches as those described for the adult (Richardson et al, 1983) . Epulides recur if not successfully managed.\n\nOdontogenic Tumors. Odontogenic tumors in young dogs and cats are rare (Figueiredo et al, 1974; Geake, 1982; Nold et aI, 1984; Valentine et aI, 1985) . They generally originate from the dental laminar epithelium and contain enamel inclusions, dental pulp stroma, or organized dental structures ( Fig. 10-4) . Of various odontogenic tumors, ameloblastoma is the most common (Richardson et al, 1983) . Radical surgical excision usually effects a cure.\n\nThe tonsils serve as regional lymph nodes of the pharynx and should be closely examined if disease is suspected. With the tongue pulled forward, the tonsils in the young dog and cat normally appear as pink, elongated structures that prolapse from their crypts when pressure is applied to the base of the tongue. Depending on the animal's age and breed, the tonsils differ \n\nare the usual complaints. The absence of tonsillar swelling does not necessarily preclude the diagnosis of tonsillitis, especially in cats. Improvement of the animal, observed with antimicrobial therapy, generally precedes resolution of the inflammation, although tonsillar swelling may continue to be present. Recurrence is com-greatly in size, shape, and amount of tonsil tissue within the crypt. The physical size and shape of the tonsils generally have no correlation with disease. Observation of the tonsils protruding from their crypts or of phlegm in the pharynx is not sufficient evidence to support a diagnosis of tonsillitis (Table 10-3) . Color is considered the best criterion for diagnosing tonsillitis. Unilateral involvement prompts close inspection for tonsillar cysts, lodged foreign objecus), or localized pharyngeal abscesses.\n\nSmall-breed young dogs are most commonly affected with primary tonsillitis. Anorexia, lethargy, dysphagia, coughing, gagging, and fever Tonsillectomy is rarely required in recurrent tonsillitis unless the tonsillar enlargement obstructs the pharynx. Most dogs can be effectively treated medically and appear to \"outgrow\" the problem. Medical treatment of tonsillitis includes using broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents and supportive care as discussed for stomatitis. Bacterial culture of inflamed tonsillar tissue usually produces J3-hemolytic streptococci, coliforms, or other bacteria of the normal oral flora (see Table 10 -2); therefore, antimicrobial sensitivities may be unreliable.\n\nSecondary tonsillitis may be associated with systemic disease or local predisposing anatomic or pathologic factors. The presence of tonsillitis does not indicate the site of primary disease. Any persistent irritation or inflammatory process of the oral cavity or pharynx (e.g., abscesses, gingivitis, lodged foreign objecns), or persistent vomiting or regurgitation) may induce a secondary tonsillitis. The gagging, regurgitation, and vomiting of foam in cases of tonsillitis necessitate differentiation from megaesophagus, pyloric disorders, cricopharyngeal achalasia, productive cough, retropharyngeal abscesses, and lodged foreign objecns) in the pharynx, larynx, or esophagus (Dillon, 1986) . Treatment should be directed toward eliminating the underlying secondary cause of the tonsillitis.\n\nPeriodontal disease starts soon after birth and continues until death. For this reason, examining for the presence of periodontal disease should be part of each examination of the oral cavity. The owner should be informed of the degree of periodontal disease present and the treatment recommended. For the young dog or cat, regular home treatments of the teeth are important for the prevention of periodontal disease. Starting early in the animal's life, the owner can effectively brush the animal's teeth with a soft child-sized toothbrush. Human dentifrices should not be used because the animal will typically swallow enough of the detergentbased dentifrice to cause gastric upset. Use of a nondetergent toothpaste or commercial dog/cat dentifrice is recommended. If the animal will not tolerate the brushing procedure, simply rubbing the tooth surface with a soft cloth dipped in one of the previously mentioned sub-\n\nThe Digestive System I 153 stances will assist in controlling early stages or mild cases of periodontal disease. These home treatments should be done at least two or three times a week. The use of treat biscuits, chew toys, and dry crunchy food, which exercise the teeth and gingiva, has been advocated to aid in reducing periodontal disease. A dog or cat is never too young to start on a dental hygiene program at home.\n\nPrognathism, or \"undershot jaw,\" describes the jaw occlusion pattern in which the mandibular incisors contact or are rostral to the maxillary incisors. The brachycephalic breeds, such as the Boston terrier, English bulldog, and pug, show this typical pattern as a normal breed characteristic (Weigel and Dorn, 1985) . In these breeds, the prognathic deformity results from the inherited defect in development of the bones in the base of the skull. The length of the mandible is determined primarily by genetic factors that are different from those affecting skull development.\n\nPositioning of the teeth and the resulting dental interlock guide the longitudinal growth of the maxilla and mandible toward their genetically predetermined lengths, which are evident when the growing animals are 3 to 9 months of age (Ross, 1975a) . The normal bite of the dog and cat exists when the maxillary incisors overlap the mandibular incisors, the mandibular canine teeth articulate rostral to the maxillary canine teeth, and the mandibular premolars close the interproximal space rostral to their maxillary counterparts-all of which constitutes the dental interlock (Ross, 1975a) . The loss of the dental interlock, or the presence of abnormal interlock, results in an inappropriate positioning of the teeth, which affects the development of the dental arcade and causes the loss of forces required to maintain correct jaw length.\n\nPrognathism occurs very early in life and may be evident before the permanent dentition appears. Extraction of the deciduous canine and incisor teeth that seem to be inhibiting the forward growth of an obviously shorter mandible is done at 8 to 12 weeks of age (Ross, 1975b) . The reasoning is that the caudal position of these teeth in relation to the position of the corresponding upper teeth blocks the normal rostral growth of the mandible. If an animal's occlusion corrects itself after extraction of the deciduous teeth, one can be reasonably assured that the prognathism was not inherited. If no improvement occurs, however, breeding of the affected animal is not recommended.\n\nBrachygnathism, or \"overshot jaw,\" occurs when the upper jaw is longer than the lower jaw ( Fig. 10-6 ). It can occur in most breeds of dogs and cats and to different degrees of severity (Weigel and Dorn, 1985) . It is an inherited defect, and animals showing brachygnathism should not be used for breeding.\n\nThe occurrence of disorders of the salivary glands in young dogs and cats is rare (Bedford, Figure 1~ . Extreme brachygnathism in this dog involves malocclusion of all teeth in the arcade. 1980 ; Harvey, 1981; Moraes Barros et al, 1985; Wallace, 1972) . Of these salivary gland disorders, sialadenitis, inflammation of a salivary gland, is likely to occur most often. Sialadenitis may be caused by bite wounds, lacerations, blunt trauma, or extension from cellulitis and abscesses of the head and neck. Sudden swelling in the region of a salivary gland, fever, inappetence, and pain on opening the mouth are usually evident on physical examination. Diagnosis of sialadenitis is usually obvious, but cytologic examination confirms salivary tissue involvement. Treatment should be aimed at the underlying cause. Ways of providing symptomatic relief include the administration of antimicrobial agents, application of warm compresses, replacement fluid therapy, drainage if abscess is present, and frequent feeding of small amounts of a nutritionally complete, soft, palatable food.\n\nA sialocele is a collection of saliva in tissue. Any age, sex, and breed of dog or cat can be affected. Sialocele formation most commonly involves the sublingual and mandibular salivary glands, where blockage of a duct or rupture of the gland causes extravasation of saliva into the surrounding connective tissue. The saliva may gravitate to the sublingual area (often referred to as a ranula), intermandibular space, mediastinum, or pharyngeal area ( Fig. 10-7) . Swelling may develop suddenly but is more likely to be in the form of a slowly developing, fluctuant sac. Diagnosis of sialocele is based on physical appearance of the cervical swelling and on cytologic evaluation. Needle aspiration of the swelling yields a viscous, mucoid fluid that is usually clear or brown. Hemorrhage and exudate, which will cytologically show clumps of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and red blood cells ders, 1983, p 1184.) with saliva, may develop after excessive manipulation of the sialocele or with infection ( Fig.  10-8) . The injection of water-soluble contrast medium through the ducts may help to identify the affected gland, but in the young dog or cat the openings of the ducts are extremely small and usually impossible to find. Therefore, a thorough physical examination and cytologic examination of aspirated fluid are more reliable. Total excision of the affected gland, which is usually the sublingual or mandibular gland, and drainage of the sialocele provide the only longterm therapy for sialoceles. Removal of an elliptic portion of the wall of a ranula allows direct drainage of salivainto the oral cavity. The surgical techniques for the management of salivary The Digestive System I 155 gland disorders are described elsewhere (Harvey, 1989) .\n\nCongenital enlargement of the parotid salivary glands has been reported in dogs (Bedford, 1980; Harvey, 1981) . The dogs typically present with hypersalivation (drooling) and are treated effectively with parotid duct ligation. Neoplasia of a salivary gland in the young dog or cat is extremely rare and is diagnosed and treated as for an adult animal.\n\nThe events of swallowing can be divided into oral, pharyngeal, and cricopharyngeal stages (Watrous and Suter, 1979) . The oral stage includes prehension of food and delivery of the food bolus to the base of the tongue. The pharyngeal stage occurs when the food bolus is propelled from the base of the tongue to the cricopharyngeal passage. The cricopharyngeal stage involves relaxation of the cricopharyngeal sphincter, passage of the food bolus into the esophagus, closure of the cricopharyngeal sphincter, and relaxation of the pharyngeal muscles (Suter and Watrous, 1980) . Difficulty in swallowing during anyone of these stages is defined as dysphagia (Shelton, 1982) . Dysphagia is uncommon in dogs and rare in cats. Dysphagia is usually recognized in puppies and kittens shortly after weaning.\n\nOral Dysphagias. Oral dysphagias may result from disturbances to various motor and sensory tracts and peripheral nerves. Branches of cranial nerves V; IX, and X provide sensory innervation for swallowing, and cranial nerves V; VII, IX, X, XI, and XII deliver motor innervation via the nucleus ambiguus and the respiratory centers (Strombeck and Guilford, 1990) . Signs of oral dysphagia may include difficulty in prehension of food and lapping water, excessive chewing or chomping, hypersalivation, and diminished or absent gag reflex ( Fig. 10-9 ). Evidence of denervation of the tongue may exist, and food may drop from the animal's mouth or be retained in the buccal cavity (Shelton, 1982) . The cineradiographic features of oral dysphagia are reduction in tongue movements, diminished or absent plunger action of the tongue, decreased bolus accumulation, and retention of bolus or contrast medium in the oropharynx.\n\nPharyngeal Dysphagias. Pharyngeal dysphagias are less consistent, and related signs are more difficult to localize. The most common signs are coughing with repeated unsuccessful attempts at swallowing and laryngotracheal aspiration of swallowed material. Often, the puppy or kitten will regurgitate masticated food several hours after ingestion, or food or liquid material will be misdirected into the nasopharynx, leading to nasal discharge (Shelton, 1982) . Cineradiographic features are generally more diagnostic than the presenting signs. These features include residual air and contrast medium in the pharynx with normal cricopharyngeal sphincter function; slow initiation and progress of pharyngeal peristaltic contractions; retention of contrast medium in the oropharynx, pharynx, and piriform recesses; and passage of contrast medium into the larynx (Suter and Watrous, 1980) . Cricopharyngeal Dysphagias. Cricopharyngeal dysphagias typically manifest as problems of asynchrony (i.e., incoordination of pharyngeal contraction and cricopharyngeal sphincter relaxation) or as achalasia (i.e., failure of cricopharyngeal sphincter relaxation) (Shelton, 1982) . In asynchrony, the cricopharyngeal muscle may contract too early or too late in relation to contraction of the pharyngeal muscles. Cricopharyngeal achalasia results from the failure of the cricopharyngeus muscle and part of the thyropharyngeus muscle to relax and thus permit a food bolus to move from the pharynx into the cranial esophagus (Rosin and Hanlon, 1972; Sokolovsky, 1967) . Signs of cricopharyngeal dysphagias can vary, depending on whether there is an achalasia or asynchrony. Because presenting signs of cricopharyngeal dysphagias are similar to those seen with pharyngeal dysphagias,. cricopharyngeal and pharyngeal dysphagias can be differentiated only by means of cineradiographic studies. If there is incomplete relaxation of the cricopharyngeal sphincter, cricopharyngeal dysphagias usually show a dorsal indentation of the food bolus as it passes through the sphincter. If there is incoordination of sphincter and pharynx, the food bolus will be misdirected into the nasopharynx ( Fig. 10-10 ) (Shelton, 1982; Suter and Watrous, 1980) .\n\nDifferentiation of oral, pharyngeal, and cricopharyngeal dysphagias is important. Myotomy of the muscles of the cricopharyngeal sphincter gives dramatic improvement in cricopharyngeal achalasia (Gourley and Leighton, 1972; Sokolovsky, 1967) . Oral and pharyngeal dysphagias are generally, however, made worse by the myotomy procedures (Suter and Watrous, 1980) . Oral and pharyngeal dysphagias are best managed by treating any underlying medical illness, changing the consistency of the animal's usual diet, and feeding the animal in an elevated position (Hoffer, 1986) . Other valuable techniques for short-term therapy are feeding by means of a nasogastric, esophagostomy, or gastrostomy tube. If conservative therapy is not helpful and the owner does not wish to continue feeding by one of the enteral methods, cricopharyngeal myotomy may be considered. In this situation, the owner should be aware that cricopharyngeal myotomy may make the animal's condition worse. \n\nCauses. Vascular ring anomalies are congenital malformations of the great vessel system that interfere with esophageal function. These anomalies produce an extramural obstruction of the esophagus at the base of the heart and rarely affect the trachea or cardiovascular system. The most frequently encountered vascular ring anomaly in the young dog or cat is persistent right aortic arch (Watrous, 1983) . Other vascular ring anomalies that occur infrequently are a double aortic arch due to persistence of both right and left fourth arches, anomalous origin of the subclavian or intercostal arteries, and an aberrant patent ductus arteriosus associated with the left or right aortic arches. The incidence of vascular ring anomalies is higher in young dogs than in young cats. Irish setters, Boston terriers, and German shepherds are the most commonly affected dog breeds (Leipold, 1977; Patterson, 1968) . Cats of all breeds are equally susceptible to persistent right aortic arch and the other vascular ring anomalies (Harpster, 1987) . Diagnosis. Signs caused by the vascular ring anomalies result from esophageal entrapment and obstruction, with subsequent precordial megaesophagus. When weaning to solid food, puppies and kittens will repeatedly regurgitate. Although regurgitation is usually associated with eating when solid food is first fed, it will occur at variable times after eating as the precordial megaesophagus worsens. Occasionally, signs in the puppy or kitten are associated with ingestion of maternal milk. The food-distended megaesophagus may be palpated at the thoracic inlet. Affected animals are obviously malnourished and underweight. Auscultation of the thorax may reveal coarse lung sounds due to laryngotracheal aspiration of ingested food and water, although heart sounds are usually normal. The diagnosis of a vascular ring anomalyinduced megaesophagus can usually be confirmed by a positive contrast esophagogram ( Fig. 10-11 ).\n\nTreatment. Treatment is early surgical correction by ligation and transection of the stricturing ligament or vessel and complete mobilization of the esophagus from the connective tissue in the area of entrapment. The surgical technique has been described elsewhere (Ellison, 1998) . Prognosis is guarded pending complete postoperative recovery because of frequent complicating factors (e.g., existing malnourish-ment, weakened state of the animal, aspiration pneumonia, and persistent megaesophagus despite surgical correction). Most animals show substantial improvement if they survive the immediate postoperative period. Persistent megaesophagus occurs if the esophagus develops sacculations, an extensive dilation that fills the anterior region of the mediastinum, or dilatation of the esophagus caudal to the vascular ring anomaly. These sacculations probably represent neuromuscular disease of the esophagus in conjunction with the vascular ring anomaly.\n\nVascular compression of the esophagus by the left subclavian artery and brachiocephalic artery has also been described in English bulldogs (Woods et aI, 1978) . Presenting signs of these dogs included recurrent regurgitation and aspiration pneumonia. Their esophagograms have shown an abrupt ventral deviation (compression) of the esophagus at the level of the first or second rib. Transection and anastomosis of the left subclavian artery relieve the regurgitation (Woods et al, 1978) . This type of vascular compression of the esophagus should be considered in any young brachycephalic dog presenting with recurrent regurgitation.\n\nEsophagitis is unusual in the young dog and cat and usually occurs because of traumatic insult, ingestion of a chemical or thermal irritant, or gastric acid reflux. Thermal injuries may occur when eager eaters bolt hot food or when puppies or kittens are fed hot gruel. Gastric acid reflux is uncommon as a primary event, but can occur any time the lower esophageal sphincter pressure is compromised, such as during anesthesia or severe blunt trauma directly to the thorax or abdomen. Esophagitis can be limited to mucosal damage or may extend into the submucosa and musculature. If only the mucosa is involved, the esophagitis is usually mild and self-limiting. Esophagitis with submucosal and musculature involvement, however, often leads to severe ulceration with subsequent perforation, fibrotic stricture formation, persistence of inflammation, and/or disturbed motor activity (acquired megaesophagus). The possibility of gastric acid reflux-induced esophagitis should be minimized during surgical procedures by fasting surgical patients for 6 to 12 hours before surgery and avoiding surgical positions that promote gastric acid reflux (e.g., positioning the head lower than the body).\n\nSigns of esophagitis are regurgitation and dysphagia. The diagnosis of esophagitis can be Medicine and Surgery, vol 1. Philadelphia, WB Saunders, 1987, p 881.) difficult because the esophagogram may appear normal, especially when only the surface mucosa is involved. Esophagoscopy may then be required to make a definitive diagnosis by visualization of mucosal changes; questionable cases may be confirmed by histopathology. Treatment of esophagitis is aimed at eliminating the underlying cause and symptomatic management of the esophagus and the systemic effects that the esophagitis created. Means of providing symptomatic relief include esophageal rest by feeding through a gastrostomy tube or by frequent small feedings of nutritionally complete, soft, bland food and administration of antimicrobial agents, Hi-receptor antagonists, metoclopramide, and sucralfate slurry (crush 1 g sucralfate and mix with 10 ml water; give 5 ml of slurry four to six times daily).\n\nCauses. Foreign objects frequently lodge in the esophagus despite its normal distensibility. Indiscriminant eating habits and inadequate mastication of food contribute to the occurrence of lodged foreign objects in young dogs, whereas cats are usually more fastidious eaters and ingest foreign objects because of their hunting or playing behavior. Common types of foreign objects that partially or completely obstruct the esophagus are bones, wood, string, fishhooks, needles, and other metallic or plastic objects. The normal esophagus has several narrow areas where swallowed objects tend to lodge. These areas include the cricopharyngeal sphincter region ( Fig. 10-12) ; the thoracic inlet, where adjacent soft tissue impedes esophageal distensibility ( Fig. 10-13 ); the heart base area, where the aorta deflects the esophagus to the right; and the gastroesophageal junction at the level of the diaphragm.\n\nDiagnosis. Diagnosis of a lodged foreign object in the esophagus is generally based on a history of ingestion. Signs are attributed to the partial or complete obstruction of the esophagus and/or the size and shape of the lodged foreign object and length of time since its becoming lodged. Early signs may include regurgitation of all ingested solids and possibly liquids, painful dysphagia, hypersalivation, repeated gulping, and anorexia. Later the signs may include profound depression, anorexia, weight loss, and other signs that relate to associated complications. These complications may include perforated esophagus, pleuritis, mediastinitis, pyothorax, mucosal lacerations, esophageal stricture, diverticula, and severe esophagitis (Houlton et ai, 1985) . Confirmation of the presence of a lodged foreign object requires a physical examination (which includes a thorough oral examination), cervical and thoracic radiographs, and esophagoscopy ( Fig. 10-14) . Treatment. A foreign object lodged in the esophagus must be considered an emergency situation because the frequency of complications increases with the duration of the problem. In most cases of a suspected foreign object lodged in the esophagus, the use of esophagoscopy is advisable. Flexible endoscopes allow easy passage into an anesthetized young dog's or cat's esophagus to visualize a foreign object and to inspect for extent of esophageal damage. If the foreign object is small, it can often be removed by passing a flexible four-prong grasping forceps through the endoscope, grasping the foreign object, and pulling it retrogradely through the mouth. If the foreign object is too large for the flexible grasping forceps, rigid grasping forceps may be passed in conjunction with a flexible endoscope (Figs. 10-15 and 10-16). Once the object is grasped, it and the endoscope can then be pulled retrogradely through the mouth. Frequently, the object becomes dislodged from the grasper as it is passing through the cricopharyngeal sphincter region. The object can then be easily retrieved by grasping it with long alligator forceps through the sphincter and thus removing it. If the object cannot be removed in a retrograde manner, one may attempt to push it directly into the stomach. Careful manipulation is necessary when pushing the object into the stomach because the caudal portion of the esophagus deviates slightly at the gastroesophageal junction.\n\nWhen the foreign object is being removed by endoscopy, by retrograde retrieval, or by pushing it into the stomach, the esophagus needs to be distended with insufflated air so that the object is freed from the esophageal wall. Once in the stomach, the foreign object may be digested and passed in the feces within 7 to 10 days or removed by gastrotomy. For passage of foreign objects, serial abdominal radiographs should be taken to confirm that the object(s) have indeed left the stomach and passed aborally through the intestinal tract without causing a subsequent obstruction.\n\nAfter the foreign object has been successfully removed via endoscopy, the extent of esophageal damage should be assessed. The esophageal mucosa is examined visually by passing the endoscope through the length of the esophagus. Usually, the degree of mucosal damage is directly proportional to the length of time that the foreign object was in the esophagus. Erythema and mild ulceration at the site of entrapment are common. Special attention should be given to any evidence of tears or perforations of the esophageal wall. Thoracic radiographs should also be taken after the removal of all esophageal foreign objects because pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum may have occurred if the esophagus was indeed perforated.\n\nIdiopathic megaesophagus is characterized by motor disturbances of the esophagus that result in abnormal or unsuccessful transport of ingesta between the pharynx and stomach. Although a complete understanding of the pathophysiology of idiopathic megaesophagus is still lacking, it is believed by most investigators that idiopathic megaesophagus results from a dysfunction of the primary motor system of the esophagus with or without secondary dysfunction of the gastroesophageal sphincter (Hoffer, 1986; Rogers et ai, 1979; Strombeck, 1978; Strombeck and Guilford, 1990; Strombeck and Troya, 1976) .\n\nCauses. Both congenital and acquired forms of idiopathic megaesophagus occur in young dogs and cats. There is evidence that congenital idiopathic megaesophagus is inherited in both the dog (e.g., wire-haired fox terrier and miniature schnauzer) and cat (Clifford et al, 1971;  Figure 10-15. The use of a flexible endoscope with a four-prong grasping forceps being passed through the operating channel. The forceps is grasping the foreign object (bone). Small foreign object(s) can then be removed by pulling the endoscope and grasping forceps retrogradely through the mouth. (From Roudebush P, Jones BD, Vaughan RW: Medical aspects of esophageal disease. In Jones BD, Liska WD reds]: Canine and Feline Gastroenterology. Philadelphia, WB Saunders, 1986, p 69.) Cox et al, 1980; Osborne et ai, 1967; Strating and Clifford, 1966) . The incidence is highest in Great Danes, German shepherds, Irish setters, Labrador retrievers, and Chinese shar-peis, Esophageal dysfunction in Chinese shar-peis may result from segmental hypomotility and esophageal redundancy (Stickle et al, 1992) . In the cat, Siamese and Siamese-related breeds have the highest incidence (Watrous, 1983) .\n\nAcquired idiopathic megaesophagus may occur spontaneously in any young dog or cat. In most instances, the underlying cause is undetermined; however, megaesophagus may occur in several systemic diseases that affect the nervous system or skeletal muscles. These diseases include myasthenia gravis, polymyositis, toxoplasmosis, canine distemper, hypothyroidism, hypoadrenocorticism, and myotonia with myopathy. Other potential diseases that could contribute to megaesophagus are systemic lupus erythematosus, tick paralysis, botulism, tetanus, lead poi- soning, ganglioradiculitis, dysautonomia, anticholinesterase compounds, and polyneuritis (Shelton, 1982; Watrous, 1983) . Megaesophagus has also been associated in cats with pyloric dysfunction (Pearson et aI, 1974) and feline dysautonomia, often referred to as the Key-Gaskell syndrome (Sharp et al, 1984) . Canine or feline dysautonomia, the main features of which are dilated pupils, dry mucous membranes, megaesophagus, constipation, and dysuria and urinary incontinence with urinary bladder distention, is a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. The cause of dysautonomia is currently unknown.\n\nDiagnosis. The onset of signs associated with congenital idiopathic megaesophagus usually begins around the time of weaning (Boudrieau and Rogers, 1985; Harvey et aI, 1974) . Signs may include effortless regurgitation of esophageal contents, weight loss, polyphagia, weakness, dehydration, impaired skeletal mineralization, ballooning of the cervical esophagus that is synchronized with respiration, and recurrent laryngotracheal aspiration that often leads to recurrent pneumonia. Oral fetor may be present owing to stagnation of fermenting ingesta retained in the dilated esophagus. Regurgitation may be seen immediately upon feeding\n\nThe Digestive System I 163 or up to 12 or more hours later. The time interval between eating and regurgitation can be related to the degree of dilation or to the general activity of the animal. Usually both liquids and solids are poorly tolerated.\n\nSurvey thoracic radiographs consistently reveal a dilated esophagus (Watrous, 1983) . The esophageal lumen typically contains sufficient air and ingesta to allow visual observation on the lateral projection a pair of soft tissue stripes that arise in the midthorax and converge toward the gastroesophageal junction. Cranially, the dorsal wall of the esophagus may merge with the longus coli muscle to outline a sharp margin. Ventrally, the ventral wall of the esophagus will create a silhouette with the dorsal wall of the air-filled trachea, creating a wide soft tissue band called the \"tracheal stripe\" (Fig. 10-17 ). When the cervical esophageal segment is dilated, a saber-shaped radiolucent shadow is seen dorsal to the trachea and tapering toward the thoracic inlet. A partially fluid-filled esophagus will present as a homogeneous gray shadow with a similar relationship to that described. With marked esophageal dilation, ventral displacement of the trachea and heart occurs. In the dorsoventral or ventrodorsal projection, the caudal thoracic esophagus is seen as a V-shaped pair of lines to either side of the midline with Saunders, 1987, pp 46, 49.) the convergence at the gastroesophageal junction. Evidence of aspiration pneumonia is frequently present and consistent with the signs of dysphagia and regurgitation.\n\nWhen the esophagus is not observed visually on survey radiographs, a contrast esophagogram is required (Watrous, 1983) . A barium contrast study better defines the degree of esophageal dilation, lack of function, and extent of involvement ( Fig. 10-18 ). The study helps rule out congenital vascular ring anomalies or other causes of localized obstruction that might contribute to megaesophagus and outlines the funnel shape of the caudal region of the esophagus to rule out invasive processes that may cause irregular or asymmetric narrowing. If no contrast medium enters the stomach, as noted on initial contrast radiographs, the animal's forequarters should be elevated for several minutes to allow for gravitational flow of the contrast medium into the stomach, and follow-up radiographs should be obtained.\n\nTreatment. In the treatment of congenital idiopathic megaesophagus, proper dietary management in terms of frequent, elevated feedings ( Fig. 10-19 ) with foods of appropriate consistency for the particular animal (some handle bulky foods well; others tolerate gruels better) generally results in spontaneous improvement in a number of animals (Watrous, 1983) . This had led investigators to believe that congenital idiopathic megaesophagus may be due to delayed neurologic development of esophageal innervation (Diamant et al, 1974; Kipnis, 1978) . With the elevated feedings, minimal stress and The Digestive System I 165 distention of the esophagus occur until such time as normal esophageal motor function develops. If stasis of esophageal contents is allowed, however, gradual overdistention and atony result, contributing to persistent megaesophagus. The earlier the dysfunction is recognized and the dietary management instituted, the better the prognosis. Puppies and kittens diagnosed at the time of weaning and managed appropriately have a better prognosis than those whose condition is recognized later, at around 4 to 6 months of age. Once severe megaesophagus occurs, complete recovery is unlikely. Aspiration pneumonia and malnourishment limit the longevity of these animals.\n\nIf the underlying cause of acquired idiopathic megaesophagus can be identified and successfully treated, the signs of megaesophagus may subside (Watrous, 1983) . The development of megaesophagus secondary to systemic disease is, however, correlated with an extremely poor response to therapy. Death results from aspiration pneumonia, gastroesophageal intussusception, malnutrition, and other related organ dysfunctions.\n\nCongenital esophageal diverticula are extremely rare in young dogs and cats. The areas of the esophagus typically involved are the area just cranial to the thoracic inlet ( Fig. 10-20 ) and the area just cranial to the diaphragm. Congenital diverticula have been attributed to abnormal separation of tracheal and esophageal embryonic buds, development of eccentric vacuoles in the formation of the esophageal lumen, and inherent weakness of the esophageal wall (Lantz et al, 1976) . Periodic diverticularization of the esophagus at the thoracic inlet is considered to be a normal finding for most young English bulldogs (Woods et al, 1978) . Periodic diverticularization or a redundancy of the esophagus at the thoracic inlet may be detected as a coincidental finding during evaluation of vomiting or regurgitation problems or may, in a few cases, cause transient regurgitation ( Fig. 10-21) .\n\nSigns of esophageal diverticula are quite varied and are related to the size of the diverticula (Fukata, 1984; Pearson et aI, 1978) . Signs may include distress or gagging soon after eating, postprandial regurgitation, intermittent anorexia and lethargy, reluctance to move, and incoordination or ataxia after eating. Diagnosis requires the differentiation of diverticula from other esophagus-related causes of regurgitation. To identify esophageal diverticula, contrast eso-phagography, fluoroscopic observation, and esophagoscopy are used. Esophagoscopy, in particular, may confirm the hernia-like outpouching from the esophageal lumen, determine the presence of associated esophagitis, and facilitate the removal of entrapped material in the diverticulum.\n\nSmall diverticula with no other associated esophageal lesions may be treated conservatively by feeding a nutritionally complete, soft, bland diet, feeding the animal in an elevated position, and administering ample liquids after feedings (Lantz et aI, 1976) . Symptomatic diverticula usually require surgical excision and reconstruction of the esophageal wall for adequate control of the signs.\n\nDisorders affecting the function of the gastroesophageal junction are uncommon. The disorders more commonly associated with its altered function are hiatal hernia with reflux esophagitis (Alexander et aI, 1975; Gaskell et al, 1974; Robotham, 1977) and gastroesophageal intussusception (Leib and Blass, 1984;  Morris and Turnwald, 1980; Singer, 1975) . Hiatal hernia is the result of a congenital or acquired defect of the phrenoesophagealligament that allows displacement of the gastroesophageal junction forward into the thoracic cavity ( Fig. 10-22 ). Hiatal hernia may also be associated with an upper respiratory obstruction, especially common in young Chinese shar-peis. Gastric contents reflux WB Saunders, 1986, p 402.) through the incompetent junction into the caudal region of the esophagus, where they produce varying degrees of irritation to the esophageal mucosa. Signs may include regurgitation with possible hematemesis, dysphagia, altered breathing pattern, and weight loss. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion followed by a barium contrast study performed under fluoroscopic observation. The hiatal hernia may be a sliding type hernia (Gaskell et ai, 1974) , which moves in and out of its normal position, or a fixed hernia (Alexander et ai, 1975) , which remains out of position. The amount of stomach that protrudes through the esophageal hiatus determines the radiographic appearance of the hernia. Usually, external abdominal pressure is necessary to demonstrate a sliding hiatal hernia (Hoffer, 1986) . The hiatal hernia may be repaired surgically. If excessive gastric reflux occurs, the gastroesophageal junction may be surgically strengthened by a gastric fundoplication (Nissen's operation) procedure (Hoffer, 1986) .\n\nGastroesophageal intussusception or invagination involves the telescoping of all or part of the stomach into the esophageal lumen ( Fig.  10-23) . Occasionally, the spleen and pancreas are also included (Singer, 1975) . The cause of this condition is not understood, but an incompetent gastroesophageal junction must be suspected. Gastroesophageal intussusception generally occurs in puppies of large breeds and in kittens, particularly those with congenital megaesophagus. A puppy or kitten will be presented to the veterinarian with sudden onset of difficulty in breathing, impending shock, and a WB Saunders, 1986, p 402.) history of vomiting. Radiographically, a mass that has a surface contour of rugal folds is seen just cranial to the diaphragm filling the caudal region of the esophagus. When the intussusception includes the spleen, its shadow will be absent on survey abdominal radiographs. The sudden onset of signs and radiographic appearance of the mass are the keys to the diagnosis. Treatment is surgical reduction of the intussusception and a gastropexy (Hoffer, 1986) .\n\nGastritis frequently occurs in dogs and cats from the time of weaning through adulthood.\n\nThe Digestive System I 167 By definition, gastritis is inflammation and mucosal damage that has occurred in response to an insult to the gastric mucosa. Vomiting is typically the primary sign of gastric disorders. Vomiting as an event first appears in puppies and kittens with a full stomach at 3 days and 10 days of age, respectively (Brizzee and Vitale, 1959; Smith et al, 1974) . The veterinarian can identify gastric disorders by observation of vomiting, which differs from regurgitation associated with esophageal disorders or from coughing and expulsion of phlegm associated with respiratory or cardiovascular disorders. Vomiting is usually preceded by a short period of nausea with licking, hypersalivation, or multiple attempts at swallowing. This period is fol- WB Saunders, 1986, p 158.) lowed by retching or several forceful, simultaneous diaphragmatic and abdominal contractions and, with the head lowered, expulsion of gastric contents (Wingfield and Twedt, 1986) .\n\nObservation of the amount, color, and consistency of vomitus is useful for obtaining insight into the origin of a gastric disorder and the degree of mucosal damage. If the vomitus consists of food, the degree of digestion indicates the length of time food has remained in the stomach. Vomitus can contain varying amounts of mucus and fluid from gastric and swallowed salivary secretions. Yellow-or greenstained vomitus indicates intestinal reflux of bile into the stomach. Vomitus containing feces usually indicates intestinal stasis or possibly intestinal obstruction. Fresh blood from gastric bleeding may be present as small red flecks or as large blood clots. Blood that has been retained in the stomach soon becomes partially digested and has a brown \"coffee grounds\" appearance. The presence of blood in vomitus usually signifies a more serious gastric disorder. Other signs associated with gastric disorders may include nausea, belching, inappetence, polydipsia, and pica. Melena, or black tarry stools, is seen with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and may imply gastric mucosal damage (Wingfield and Twedt, 1986) . Causes. Gastritis can be associated with a multitude of factors but more commonly results from dietary indiscretions, infectious diseases, and possibly endoparasites. It is often associated with ingestion of rancid or contaminated foodstuffs that leads to food intoxication. The contaminated foodstuffs generally contain products of fermentation or putrefaction, various bacterial enterotoxins, and possibly mycotoxins (Harris, 1975) . Ingestion of foreign material such as bones, pins, needles, plastic objects, food wrappings, rocks, and small toys mechanically irritates the gastric mucosa and thereby causes gastritis. The incidence of ingested foreign material is much higher in young dogs and cats, possibly owing to their developmental chewing habits and curious natures. Trichobezoars (hairballs) are frequently seen in the vomitus of longhaired cats and some dogs. Many drugs (e.g., antimicrobial agents, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, anthelmintics, and corticosteroids) and chemicals (e.g., heavy metals, cleaning agents, fertilizers, and herbicides) may also contribute to gastritis in the young animal (Atkins and Johnson, 1975; Harris, 1975) .\n\nMany types of ingested plants and plant toxins may cause gastritis. The ingestion of grass and plants by seemingly healthy animals is not uncommon, possibly owing to their natural, instinctual behaviors. Many young dogs and cats with gastric disorders, for some unknown reason, frequently ingest and then vomit grass or plant material. The incidence of bacterial-induced gastritis is extremely low because the acidic gastric lumen does not favor the growth and colonization of bacteria (Strombeck and Guilford, 1990) . A gastric chlamydial infection has been identified in young cats (Gaillard et al, 1984) . Viruses such as canine distemper virus, canine herpesvirus, canine adenovirus-I, coronaviruses, and parvoviruses may cause gastric lesions and vomiting as a part of a more extensive disease condition. Mycotic infections of the stomach are extremely rare and generally not an important cause of gastritis in dogs and cats younger than 6 months (Ader, 1979; Foil et al, 1984) . Endoparasites seldom produce gastric lesions or signs. Physaloptera species, Ollulanus tricuspis (cats), ascarids, and, occasionally, tapeworms are endoparasites that may be associated with gastric irritation and vomiting. Other conditions, including renal failure, liver disease, neurologic disease, shock, sepsis, and possibly altered behavior, may also play a role in the cause of gastritis in the young dog and cat.\n\nDiagnosis and Treatment. Gastritis is gen-erally diagnosed and treated on the basis of the animal's history, signs, and physical findings. Symptomatic treatment of most cases of gastritis and vomiting is begun without extensive diagnostic procedures. Most animals show improvement within 12 to 24 hours after little or no therapy and usually are treated on an outpatient basis. Those animals with persistent vomiting, evidence of dehydration, abdominal pain, organomegaly or palpable abdominal mass, or failure to respond to previous symptomatic treatment require further medical and laboratory evaluation. The general principles of the treatment of gastric disorders include removing the inciting cause; providing proper conditions to promote mucosal repair; correcting fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base abnormalities; and alleviating secondary complications of gastritis, such as abdominal pain and diarrhea (Wingfield and Twedt, 1986) . Dietary restriction is the initial management for gastritis. An animal with gastritis should be withheld food for 24 to 48 hours and water for 12 to 24 hours. If no vomiting occurs during this period of management, over the next 2 to 5 days the animal is gradually returned to full feed and water. Water is offered initially in small, frequent amounts or provided in ice cubes, enough to keep the mouth moist and to supply a modest fluid replacement. Until vomiting is well controlled, small amounts (three to six times daily) of a highly digestible, low-fiber diet are fed frequently, including cooked rice or cooked cereals supplemented in a 50:50 ratio with low-fat cottage cheese, boiled chicken, lean boiled ground beef, or commercial baby foods. Commercial diets formulated for gastrointestinal disease may also be prescribed. One can expect most cases of vomiting in young dogs and cats to respond to just dietary and water intake management.\n\nAdministration of parenteral fluids is initiated when electrolyte or acid-base imbalances or dehydration occurs. The quantity of fluids given should be enough to supply daily maintenance needs (approximately 40 to 60 ml/kg per day), to correct existing dehydration, and to replace fluid losses caused by continued vomiting. Vomiting in gastritis generally results in volume depletion and losses of sodium, chloride, and potassium with a metabolic acidosis. An isotonic, balanced electrolyte solution such as lactated Ringer's solution is usually given (Twedt and Grauer, 1982) .\n\nAntiemetic drugs may be given to control refractory vomiting in dogs and cats older than 3 months (Table 10 -4) and when the presence of a pyloric dysfunction or a gastric foreign object has been ruled out. These drugs inhibit vomiting but do little for primary treatment of gastritis. Antiemetic drugs act centrally by suppressing either the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CRTZ), the emetic center, or the vestibular apparatus. The phenothiazine tranquilizers (chlorpromazine) have a broad-spectrum pharmacologic effect in blocking the emetic center and the CRTZ and some anticholinergic action (Davis, 1980; DeNovo, 1986) . These drugs are effective in blocking viscerally stimulated vomiting caused by gastritis and can be given to animals with protracted vomiting. The phenothiazines should not be given to a dehydrated or a hypotensive animal or when a hepatopathy is suspected (DeNovo, 1986) .\n\nAnticholinergic drugs reduce gastric motility and smooth muscle spasms. In addition to blocking the parasympathetic stimulation of smooth muscles, these drugs block the cephalic and gastric phases of gastric acid secretion, but they do not block histamine or gastrin-stimulated acid secretion. These drugs have the adverse effect of slowing gastric emptying, which results in gastric distention and further gastric acid secretion. Overuse of the anticholinergic drugs can cause gastric atony and a pharmacologic gastric outflow obstruction, resulting in further vomiting. Anticholinergic drugs used in the therapy of gastric disorders include atropine and propantheline (DeNovo, 1986) . These drugs often are combined with an antiemetic for veterinary use.\n\nOral protectants, such as kaolin and pectin, and antimicrobial agents are usually not indicated for the treatment of gastritis in the young dog or cat. Protectants may bind certain bacteria or toxins, but they do not coat or protect the irritated gastric mucosa. Any potential benefit is frequently outweighed by difficulty in owner administration and vomiting that occurs because of gastric distention. Sucralfate in tablet form or given as a slurry (crush 1 g sucralfate and mix with 10 ml water; give 5 ml of slurry four to six times daily) may, however, be protective when the gastric mucosa is irritated or ulcerated. Antimicrobial agents are not required unless a bacterial infection is suspected.\n\nSecretory blockers (Hj-receptor antagonists), such as cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine, are effective in reducing gastric acid production by blocking the Hz receptors of the parietal cells (see Table 10 -4). Use of these drugs has been recommended in the symptomatic treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers and in syn-\n\nThe Digestive System I 171 dromes resulting in gastric acid hypersecretion (Wingfield and Twedt, 1986) . They may be useful as adjunctive therapy in some types of gastritis; however, they probably should not be administered to dogs or cats younger than 2 months of age. Cimetidine inhibits hepatic blood flow and microsomal enzymes and should not be given to puppies and kittens with liver disease or those receiving other hepatically metabolized drugs. Severe gastric hemorrhage should be treated as an emergency. Whole blood and parenteral fluids should be given to replace blood and fluid loss. Attempts at controlling bleeding are generally made with the use of gastric lavages with ice water or surgical gastrectomy.\n\nWith ingestion of small objects such as needles or pins with no evidence of vomiting, one may elect to allow for natural passage of the object(s). A high-fiber diet is given, and the animal is kept under strict observation. Failure to pass the object(s) in 48 hours or lack of movement of the objecus), as determined by serial abdominal radiographs, requires surgical removal of the objectts). Emetic drugs to initiate vomiting should be used with extreme caution. They should be attempted only when the foreign object(s) are small and have smooth surfaces that will not cause gastric or esophageal laceration, perforation, or obstruction. Vaseline or other petroleum-based products may be used to promote passage of small hairballs aborally through the gastrointestinal tract. Owners should not be advised to administer oily-liquid products such as mineral oil orally, as it may cause laryngotracheal aspiration and a subsequent pneumonia.\n\nEndoscopy can be used because many gastric foreign objects can be removed successfully with grasping forceps or snares under endoscopic visual observation. The methods used to retrieve foreign objects from the stomach via endoscopy are quite similar to those used to remove lodged foreign objects from the esophagus. Surgical removal of gastric foreign objects offers the advantage of examining the other sections of the gastrointestinal tract for foreign objects or other abnormalities.\n\nCauses. Gastric retention and paresis are most often associated with pyloric dysfunction, motility disturbances of the stomach, or both (Strombeck and Guilford, 1990) . Pyloric dys- Available in 5-mg tablet and 5-mg suppository; takes 6-12 hours for tablets to take effect; animal should be well hydrated and feces softened before its use Available in powder form; takes 12-24 hours to take effect Available in 50-and 100-mg capsules, 1% liquid, 4 mg/ml syrup; takes 12-72 hours to take effect; animal should be well hydrated before its use Available in 50-and 24O-mg tablets; similar activity and precautions as for dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate Overdosage may cause diarrhea, flatulence, intestinal cramping (colic), dehydration, and acidosis Available in powder form; takes 12-24 hours to take effect Available in paste form; should be given only between meals; takes 12-24 hours to take effect Administer 30 min before feeding; may cause increased heart rate \u00b7PO = oral administration; SC = subcutaneous administration; IV = intravenous administration; 1M = intramuscular administration; sid = once daily; bid = twice daily; tid = three times daily; qid = four times daily. function in the young dog or cat usually results from congenital pyloric stenosis or from an intraluminal foreign object obstructing the gastric outflow area. Traumatic injury and inflammatory disease can reduce motility throughout the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in the retention of gastric contents. Drugs, hypokalemia, recurring gastric dilation, and long-term obstruction of the pylorus may also contribute to altered gastric motility and gastric retention.\n\nCongenital pyloric stenosis is recognized most often in the boxer and Boston terrier dog breeds. It rarely occurs in the young cat, although Siamese cats have the highest reported incidence (Boehringer, 1973; Pearson et al, 1974) . Congenital pyloric stenosis probably is caused by excessive secretion of gastrointestinal hormones (Wingfield and Twedt, 1986) . Gastrin, produced by the G cells in the stomach wall, has a potent trophic effect on pyloric circular smooth muscle as well as on the mucosa. With altered gastric motility and antral distention, the G cells are stimulated to release gastrin, ultimately leading to an increase in gastric acid production and pyloric stenosis from hypertrophy of the circular smooth muscle.\n\nDiagnosis. Gastric retention either is present at birth or develops with advancing age. Vomiting at variable intervals after ingestion of solid food, with accompanying gastric distention, is the primary sign of gastric retention (Wingfield and Twedt, 1986 ). The vomitus is usually undigested food and is rarely bile stained. Animals with gastric retention may exhibit projectile vomiting; the vomiting occurs abruptly and without the warning of hypersalivation and retching. In most instances, the vomitus is propelled a considerable distance and readily empties the stomach. After vomiting, the animal will usually resume feeding, only to vomit again at variable intervals.\n\nOn survey abdominal radiographs, the presence of gastric distention with food or air, long after the ingesta should be in the intestine (within 6 to 8 hours after eating), is suggestive of gastric retention. In the cat with a gastric retention problem, although the fundus and body become elongated craniocaudally because of an increase in gastric volume, the fundus and body remain on the left side of the midline . Contrast medium studies are useful for assessing the rate of gastric emptying of liquids in those animals suspected of having an abnormal gastric retention problem. Less than 30 minutes is generally considered to be a normal gastric emptying time for a quiet, well-behaved animal. The presence of contrast medium or food in the stomach for longer than 12 to 24 hours is definitely abnormal and should be considered evidence of gastric retention. Chemical or manual restraint of the young animal will slow gastric emptying for a variable length of time (Zontine, 1973) . Fluoroscopic studies with contrast medium are required for assessing altered gastric motility as a cause of a gastric retention problem. In gastric retention caused by altered motility, the motor activity is usually of normal rate and intensity but results only in a dilation of the antrum, with little contrast medium passing aborally through the pyloric canal (Wingfield and Twedt, 1986) .\n\nEndoscopy in dogs and cats younger than 6 months with hypertrophy of the pyloric musculature is not well documented. One should remember that the pyloric orifice of the mature dog is usually partially open, and passage of the flexible endoscope through the pylorus may be possible in a nonobstructed pyloric canal. In dogs younger than 6 months and in cats, however, the animal's pyloric canal may not be large enough to accommodate the standard endoscope. Failure of passage of a flexible endoscope through the pyloric canal of the mature dog is suggestive of pyloric stenosis, and biopsy specimens should be obtained to determine diagnosis and prognosis. This may not necessarily be true for the young dog or cat.\n\nTreatment. Congenital pyloric stenosis is generally managed surgically with pyloroplasty (DeHoff, 1986; Walter et ai, 1985) . Medical therapy has been generally directed toward the control of signs, mainly through the use of dietary management and antiemetic drugs. Gastric stimulation with metoclopramide is helpful in animals with functional, but not anatomical, gastric retention (see Table 10 -4). Metoclopramide increases gastric antral contractions, promotes relaxation of the pylorus, and increases smooth muscle contraction in the proximal small intestine. This enhances coordination of the antral and duodenal contractions, with subsequent acceleration of gastric emptying and small intestinal transit. Metoclopramide is contraindicated whenever increased gastrointestinal motility might be harmful. It should not be administered to animals with central nervous system disease, given in conjunction with phenothiazines or narcotic analgesics, or administered to animals younger than 2 months of age.\n\nGastric dilation-volvulus syndrome is most frequently seen in dogs between the ages of 2 and 10 years and seldom in cats or dogs younger than 6 months (Key, 1977) . Overeating or signs of altered gastric motility may begin immediately after weaning to solid food, leading to gastric dilation-volvulus later in life.\n\nDiagnosis. Gastric dilation usually precedes the volvulus (Figs. 10-24 and 10-25) . Young dogs presenting with gastric dilation rarely have tympany on percussion of the abdomen (Wingfield and Twedt, 1986) . The animals are often lethargic and reluctant to move and make The Digestive System I 175 grunting sounds with each respiratory effort. Attempts to palpate the abdomen encounter abdominal splinting and increased grunting sounds. In most instances, the animals make no attempt to retch or vomit. If the animal exhibits sudden onset of gastric tympany, there will be cranial abdominal distention and the abdomen will be tensed upon palpation. Increased respiratory efforts, hyperpnea, and open-mouthed panting are frequently noted. Abdominal palpation may also reveal splenomegaly, with the spleen oriented cranially to caudally along the ventral midline of the abdomen. Retching with an inability to vomit may be observed. The retching may become quite violent without producing vomitus. With increasing efforts to retch, the abdomen further distends from swallowed air.\n\nAs gastric distention progresses, signs of shock become evident. A weak femoral pulse, tachycardia, and prolonged capillary refill time of the mucous membranes are commonly noted. Increased venous pressures can be observed by placing the dog in lateral recumbency and observing the saphenous vein (Wingfield and Twedt, 1986) . As the leg of a healthy dog is slowly raised to the level of the right atrium, Saunders, 1986, p 428.) this vein disappears. In the dog with gastric dilation-volvulus, the leg may be raised well above the level of the right atrium before the vein collapses, suggesting increased venous pressure.\n\nPassage of an orogastric tube does not eliminate the possibility of gastric volvulus; the definitive diagnosis is confirmed by abdominal radiographs. Radiographs are obtained after the initial therapy for circulatory shock and gastric decompression because positioning for radiographs increases stress and risk to the animal (Wingfield and Twedt, 1986) . Barium contrast medium will assist in identifying the position of the pylorus, which is most important in determining the presence of a gastric volvulus. Because the stomach may partially derotate after decompression, position of the pylorus in other than the far right cranial abdominal quadrant must be considered evidence that gastric dilation-volvulus existed before decompression.\n\nTreatment. Baseline laboratory samples should be collected before large-volume fluid replacement and gastric decompression. A packed cell volume and a total plasma solids value (total plasma protein) provide information useful in assessing the need for fluid replacement. Determining a complete blood count and blood glucose level is useful in assessing the presence of endotoxic shock. Leukopenia \u00ab 3000 leukocytes/ul), a prominent left shift, and hypoglycemia \u00ab60 mg glucose/dl) suggest septicemia (Wingfield and Twedt, 1986) .\n\nGastric decompression is immediately accomplished by passing a large-bore, firm, flexible, well-lubricated orogastric tube or by gastrocentesis (trocarization). When the orogastric tube cannot be passed, the stomach may be decompressed with a 12-to 16-gauge needle. Partial relief of gastric air often allows subsequent passage of the orogastric tube. Cardiovascular function generally improves following gastric decompression and is further improved by rapid volume replacement using intravenous, balanced electrolyte solution supplemented with potassium chloride. A transient hyperkalemia results from gastric decompression (Wingfield et aI, 1975) ; however, a deficit in total body potassium levels is usually present owing to gastrointestinal loss and reduced intake of potassium. Corticosteroids are routinely used in the management of shock (Rawlings et al, 1976 ). Fluid replacement therapy should always precede corticosteroid therapy. Additionally, broadspectrum antimicrobial agents are used to control preoperative and postvolvulus bacterial numbers and to lessen the severity of endotoxemia (Wingfield and Twedt, 1986) .\n\nSurgical procedures to correct gastric dilation-volvulus have been described elsewhere (Lantz, 1998) . After either surgical correction or radiographic evidence that the stomach has returned naturally to its proper position, small amounts of water are gradually provided in a bowl or in the form of ice cubes. Food is withheld until the dog has not vomited for at least 24 hours; then one third of the daily requirement of a highly digestible diet, divided into\n\nThe Digestive System I I77 three to six small meals, is fed. Over the next 3 to 7 days, the amount of food fed is gradually increased up to the animal's maintenance caloric needs.\n\nPrevention. Several surgical techniques have been described to prevent recurrence of gastric dilation-volvulus. These include gastropexy, gastrocolopexy, permanent gastropexy, tube gastrostomy, circumcostal gastropexy, belt loop gastropexy, and ventral midline gastropexy. Of these techniques, the circumcostal gastropexy, belt loop gastropexy, and ventral midline gastropexy appear to be the most successful procedures for preventing recurrence and provide a greater adhesion strength than the permanent or tube gastrostomy techniques. Application of feeding techniques that promote gastric emptying is also useful in preventing gastric dilationvolvulus. During the animal's growth period it is important to provide a high-quality, low-fiber, highly digestible, and nutritionally balanced diet. All dogs should be fed throughout their lives at least twice daily or \"free choice.\" Dogs previously affected with gastric dilation-volvulus syndrome should be fed a highly digestible diet at least three times a day, and their physical activity and excitement should be minimized before, during, and for 1 hour after feeding. Feeding the dog by itself and in a quiet location may also be helpful.\n\nCongenital disorders of the intestinal tract are rarely encountered in puppies and kittens, probably because most such affected animals die at birth or become fading puppies or kittens. The congenital disorders that have been reported include atresia of intestinal segment (Ladds and Anderson, 1971; Martin, 1977; Mullen, 1982; Smart et al, 1978; van der Gaag and Tibboel, 1980 ) and duplication of intestinal segment aa- kowski, 1977) . These disorders in the newborn puppy or kitten are usually incompatible with life unless corrected surgically.\n\nEnterocolitis frequently occurs in dogs and cats from the time of weaning through adulthood. Enterocolitis is inflammation and mucosal damage that has occurred in response to an insult to the small and large intestine. Diarrhea is the primary sign of enterocolitis and often occurs secondary to many nonintestinal diseases. Diar-rhea of young dogs and cats typically is of abrupt onset and has a short course that ranges from transient and self-limiting to fulminating and explosive. With the aid of history, physical examination, and stool characteristics (i.e., frequency, volume, consistency, color, odor, and composition), diarrhea can be localized to the small intestine, large intestine, or both (Table  10-5) , and a search for the cause and treatment can be undertaken.\n\nCauses. Enterocolitis is associated with many factors but more commonly results from dietary indiscretions, infectious diseases, and endoparasitism. Dietary causes may include intestinal overload from overeating; ingestion of rancid or spoiled foodstuffs from scavenging of decomposing garbage or carrion; ingestion of indigestible and abrasive foreign material, such as bones, rocks, plants, wood, cloth, thread and sewing needles (Felts et al, 1984) , and plastic objects; intolerance of lactose ingested as milk; and intolerance of miscellaneous types of food, such as fatty or spicy food. The incidence of ingesting foreign objects is much higher for young dogs and cats, probably because of their developmental chewing habits and curious natures. Trichobezoars (hairballs) are frequently encountered in the diarrheic stools of long-haired cats and some dogs. Many drugs (e.g., corticosteroids, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, antimicrobial agents, and anthelmintics) and chemicals (e.g., heavy metals, cleaning agents, fertilizers, and herbicides) may cause enterocolitis (Atkins and Johnson, 1975; Harris, 1975) . Many ingested plants and plant toxins may cause diarrhea and an associated enterocolitis.\n\nMany infectious agents are generally associated with varying degrees of enterocolitis. Bacteria (e.g., Salmonella species, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter species, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus piliformis, and Clostridium perfringens) reside in, and may contribute to severe mucosal damage in, the small and/or large intestine. Viruses (e.g., canine distemper virus, parvovirus-2, coronavirus, and rotavirus) are important causes of enterocolitis in young dogs. Other viruses that have been identified in unformed stools of dogs are a minute parvovirus (canine parvovirus-1), adenovirus, caliciviruses (Evermann et al, 1985) , paramyxovirus-like virus, astrovirus, picornavirus, and human echovirus and coxsackievirus (Greene, 1990 (Greene, 1990) . In refractory diarrheal problems, feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, and feline infectious peritonitis virus should be considered in the diagnosis. The primary fungi infecting the intestinal tract are Histoplasma capsulatum, Aspergillus species, and Pythium species; however, they are uncommon in dogs and cats younger than 6 months.\n\nEndoparasites generally do not produce intestinal lesions but contribute importantly to generalized unthriftiness, diarrhea, and weight loss or failure to gain adequate body weight. The younger the animal, the more frequent are endoparasites present and the more severe the consequences of endoparasitism. Endoparasitism often complicates other existing intestinal disorders such as virus-or bacterial-induced enterocolitis. The more common endoparasites that are identified in the intestinal tract of young dogs and cats are listed in Table 10-6. Other disorders, including renal failure, liver disease, neurologic disease, shock, sepsis, hypoadrenocorticism, stress, and even altered behavior, may play a prominent role in the cause of enterocolitis (Strombeck and Guilford, 1990) .\n\nDiagnosis. The diagnosis of acute enterocolitis is usually made on the basis of an animal's history, signs, and physical findings, often without detailed diagnostic procedures. A review of the animal's vaccination status, diet, current The Digestive System I 179 medications, and possible exposure to chemicals or infectious diseases is warranted. Endoparasites, ingestion of questionable food or foreign material, and/or infectious diseases should always be considered the primary cause of enterocolitis in the young dog or cat until proved otherwise. Animals that experience severe illness or fail to respond to symptomatic therapy usually require a more detailed medical and laboratory evaluation. Diagnostic efforts should then be aimed at detection of an underlying nonintestinal disease as the contributing cause of the diarrhea. Diagnostic evaluations considered for short-term diarrhea are fecal identification of endoparasites, virologic tests, fecal cultures for bacteria, and survey abdominal radiographs for detection of intestinal foreign material or an obstruction.\n\nTreatment. Enterocolitis is generally treated on the basis of the animal's history, signs, and physical findings. Symptomatic treatment is given initially for most cases of enterocolitis and diarrhea without extensive diagnostic procedures. Most animals with enterocolitis show improvement within 24 to 48 hours with little or no therapy and usually are treated on an outpatient basis. The basic principles in the treatment of enterocolitis include removing the inciting cause; providing proper conditions to promote mucosal repair; correcting fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base abnormalities; and alleviating secondary complications of enterocolitis, such as vomiting, abdominal pain, and infection.\n\nDietary restriction is the initial step in the management of enterocolitis. Animals with severe intestinal disturbances should be deprived of food for 24 to 48 hours or longer. Water may be offered in small amounts during the first 24 hours. If the animal is vomiting, however, water should be restricted. Restriction of food and possibly water allows for restoration of mucosal integrity and a more rapid return of gastrointestinal function. In most cases, fasting reduces or eliminates diarrhea by removing the osmotic or irritating effects of undigested or unabsorbed nutrients. If no diarrhea has occurred during the 24-to 48-hour fast, small amounts of a highly digestible, low-fiber, moderately low-fat diet are fed three to six times daily, such as cooked rice or cooked cereals supplemented in a 4:1 ratio with low-fat cottage cheese, lean boiled ground beef or chicken, or commercial baby foods. Commercial diets formulated for gastrointestinal disease may also be prescribed. With the commercial diets, the animal is first fed one third the amount needed to meet normal maintenance caloric needs. Over the next several days, the amount of food is gradually increased to meet the animal's needs in order to maintain body weight.\n\nParenteral fluids are initiated when electrolyte or acid-base imbalances or dehydration occurs. The quantity of fluids given should be enough to supply daily maintenance needs (approximately 40 to 60 mlIkg per day), to correct existing dehydration, and to replace fluid losses that may occur with continued diarrhea and vomiting. Diarrhea in enterocolitis generally results in volume depletion and losses of sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and potassium with metabolic acidosis. An isotonic, balanced electrolyte solution such as lactated Ringer's solution is usually recommended (Twedt and Grauer, 1982) . Potassium levels are often depleted, particularly if inappetence has accompanied profuse diarrhea, and additional potassium chloride should be added to the fluids. The amount of potassium chloride added is based on the existing serum potassium levels.\n\nProtectants are used frequently in the general treatment of diarrhea, although they are probably not beneficial in animals (DeNovo, 1986) . There is, however, some evidence that pectin plus salicylates can absorb and inactivate enterotoxins, such as those produced by Escherichia coli. Of the salicylates, bismuth subsalicylate appears to be more effective as an oral antidiarrheal compound. The dose is about 0.25 mllkg body weight divided into four to six equal daily doses. Bismuth subsalicylate probably should be administered with caution in cats because of their increased sensitivity to aspirin and should not be administered to cats younger than 3 months of age. Its taste is unpleasant, but some of the resistance to administration may be overcome by keeping the product in the refrigerator and administering it cold.\n\nThe use of narcotic analgesics as antimotility drugs is warranted in the treatment of some diarrheas (see Table 10 -4). The rationale behind their use is based on their direct action on the smooth muscle of the small intestine and colon, causing increasing tone and segmentation (De-Novo, 1986 ). This produces increased resistance to luminal transit of ingesta. These drugs effectively relieve abdominal pain and tenesmus and reduce the frequency of stools. Anticholinergic and related antispasmodic drugs have an uncertain role in the management of diarrhea. Anticholinergic drugs block the effect of acetylcholine, the major neurotransmitter of the gastrointestinal smooth muscle, resulting in both decreased peristalsis and decreased segmenta-tion. With their use, motility of the small intestine and colon can be stopped, which allows the occurrence of bacterial overgrowth, thus compounding the hypomotility and possibly the diarrhea problem. Therefore, the narcotic analgesics, such as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and loperamide hydrochloride, are the preferred motility modifiers to be used in the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea. If the diarrhea is caused by an infectious agent such as Salmonel/a, the narcotic analgesics may be detrimental because they may trap organisms and their toxins within the intestine, and the infection may persist longer.\n\nBecause of the frequent occurrence of endoparasites as the primary or secondary cause of enterocolitis in the young dog or cat, routine administration of an appropriate antiparasitic drug is recommended. Currently available antiparasitic drugs for dogs and cats are listed in Table 10 -7. The use of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of diarrhea is controversial. If antimicrobial agents only succeed in inhibiting the normal intestinal flora, they are detrimental. In diarrhea, antimicrobial therapy is warranted only when there is evidence of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract (numerous inflammatory cells in the feces), damaged intestinal mucosa (blood in the stool), a systemic inflammatory reaction (fever and leukocytosis), and/or abnormal fecal culture results (Strombeck and Guilford, 1990 ).\n\nCauses. Protein-losing enteropathies are characterized by the loss of protein into the intestinal lumen. Causes of protein-losing enteropathies in young dogs and cats include congenital lymphangiectasia, congestive heart failure, and infectious inflammatory and ulcerative enteric diseases. Congenital lymphangiectasia results from malformation of the lymphatic system; it rarely occurs in puppies and kittens. Two breeds of dogs are reported to be predisposed to a form of lymphangiectasia and protein-losing enteropathy, that is, the Norwegian lundehund (Flesja and Torstein, 1977) and the basenji (Breitschwerdt et al, 1984) . In the Norwegian lundehund, the disorder appears to have a hereditary basis and is characterized by intermittent diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, anorexia, hypoalbuminemia, ascites, and edema.\n\nIn the basenji, the lymphangiectasia occurs secondary to a unique intestinal disease that has been referred to as immunoproliferative enteropathy of basenjis (Breitschwerdt et al, 1984) . This\n\nThe Recently weaned puppies respond better to splitdose administration (twice daily); cannot give to nursing puppies or those less than 2.3 kg (5 lb); do not feed milk or other fatty foods during treatment; occasionally deaths (Airedales); some vomiting and hypersalivation Cannot use in puppies less than 5 wk of age or those less than 0.9 kg (2 lb); some vomiting and hypersalivation\n\nTo check results of treatment, examine stools passed on 2-3 consecutive days because larvae are discharged sporadically; no known contraindication in either dogs or cats Very effective for Trichomonas and somewhat effective for Giardia; no known contraindication in either dogs or cats 'PO = oral administration; SC = subcutaneous administration; 1M = intramuscular administration. Retreatment is advisable to kill mature worms that were immature larvae during earlier treatments. Retreatment schedule: Hookwonns-for litter from a bitch that previously lost puppies from hookworm anetnia or heavily parasitized puppies, treat weekly for 5-6 treatments, beginning at 2 wk of age; others, retreat in 2-3 wk. Ascarids-forpuppies and kittens with heavy ascarid infection, treat every week for 3--4 treatments, beginning at 2 wk of age; for older animals retreatment is done in 3--4 wk. Whipworms-for severe infections, retreat in 2--4 wk; recheck at 3-mo intervals. Tapewonns-retreatment is in 3--4 wk, and for Dipylidium caninum infection, flea eradication program is enforced. Strongyloides-repeat treatment monthly if needed.\n\ndisorder appears to have a hereditary basis and is characterized by bouts of intermittent diarrhea, weight loss, hypoalbuminemia, hyperglobulinemia (an unusual finding in protein-losing enteropathy), and widespread lymphoeytic-plasmaeytic infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nIn puppies, swelling of buccal lymph nodes, adverse effects from routine vaccinations, and transient neurologic signs are additional features of the disorder. Neurologic signs may include incoordination, paresis, seizures, and contracture of the facial musculature.\n\nDiagnosis. The diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy and lymphangiectasia is established by the animal's history, signs, physical findings, and histologic confirmation of the characteristic lesions in intestinal biopsy specimens (Sherding, 1986) . Biopsy specimens may be obtained via laparotomy or less invasively by endoscopy or peroral suction biopsy capsule. Surgery in dogs with severe hypoalbuminemia or emaciation is not without risk. Full-thickness surgical biopsy tissue from the intestine often leads to dehiscence of the enterotomy incisions and post-operative peritonitis; serosal patching at incisional sites may be needed. Thus, when possible, biopsies performed via endoscopy or suction biopsy capsule are preferred over full-thickness biopsies.\n\nWith congenital protein-losing enteropathy and lymphangiectasia, carrier dogs may be subclinically affected well into breeding age. A developed fecal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can be used in early screening of potential breeding animals and for puppies as young as 3 months. In testing progeny of affected dogs, results of the fecal ELISA become abnormal well before identifiable hypoalbuminemia occurs. This ELISA measures naturally occurring fecal aI-protease inhibitor in freshly passed stool samples-three consecutive bowel movements are submitted to the diagnostic laboratory for fecal ELISA testing. The assay quantifies the concentration of aI-protease inhibitor, the second most abundant plasma protein in dogs. Normal concentrations of this fecal protein are less than 6 ....g/g offeces.\n\nTreatment. The primary therapy for protein-losing enteropathies is to decrease the intestinal loss of plasma proteins so that normal serum protein levels can be restored and edema and effusions controlled. Dietary manipulation and elimination of the underlying cause of the protein-losing enteropathy are the primary methods used in its treatment (Tams and Twedt, 1981) . The preferred diet for young dogs and cats with protein-losing enteropathy should contain minimal fat and provide an ample amount of high-quality protein. Commercial diets formulated for gastrointestinal diseases or commercial diets formulated for weight reduction may be prescribed. These diets should be supplemented with the fat-soluble vitamins and be divided into three or more feedings daily.\n\nLow-fat diets are inherently low in calories; yet another part of therapy is to reverse the weight loss and malnourishment that usually accompany protein-losing enteropathies (Sherding, 1986) . As an immediate caloric source, medium-chain triglycerides can be added to the diet to replace the calories lost by removal of fat from the diet. Commercially available medium-chain triglycerides are derived from coconut oil and can be added to the daily diet as an oil (e.g., MCT, Mead Johnson Nutritionals; 8.3 kcallg; 1 tbsp weighs 14 g and contains 115 kcal, to be given at a dosage of 1 to 2 mllkg body weight) or as a powdered elemental diet mixture (e.g., Portagen, Mead Johnson Nutritionals; 1 1/2 cups added to water to The Digestive System I 185 make 1 quart of mixture with 30 kcallfl oz). Excessive intake of these medium-chain triglyceride products may contribute to vomiting or aggravate diarrhea.\n\nIn addition to dietary manipulation, proteinlosing enteropathies often improve with antiinflammatory doses of corticosteroids, such as oral prednisolone at an initial dosage of 2 to 3 mg/ kg per day. Once remission has been achieved, this dosage is adjusted to a lower maintenance level. Other measures may need to be considered in the unique enteropathy of the basenji. In addition to dietary management and corticosteroids, reduction of stress and short-term use of antimicrobial agents for the control of bacterial overgrowth of the intestinal tract may be needed. When protein-losing enteropathies occur secondary to an identifiable anatomic lymphatic (malformation) obstruction, surgical intervention for relief of the obstruction should be considered.\n\nA wheat-sensitive enteropathy has been identified in Irish setter dogs that is characterized by poor weight gain or weight loss and bouts of intermittent diarrhea, with an onset of signs typically between 4 and 7 months of age (Batt, 1986) . In this disorder, morphologic changes in the mucosa of the small intestine, as determined by mucosal biopsies, are variable; changes appear patchy within individual animals and consist of partial villous atrophy with no remarkable alterations in the cellular components of the lamina propria. Specific activities of important brush-border enzymes of the villus are selectively decreased, and this is probably responsible for hypersensitivity to various components in dietary wheat (Batt et aI, 1984) . Thus the diarrheal disorder is attributed more to brush-border enzyme abnormalities than to specific morphologic changes in the small intestinal mucosa. Dietary management is the most practical approach to its diagnosis and treatment. A wheatsensitive enteropathy can usually be determined by a positive response to removal of wheat from the diet and return of signs when wheat is reintroduced.\n\nA selective cobalamin malabsorption disorder has been identified in giant schnauzer and in border collie dogs that is characterized by poor weight gain or weight loss and bouts of lethargy and inappetence, with an onset of signs typically between 3 and 6 months of age (Fyfe et al, 1989) . There is a defect in transport of intrinsic factor/cobalamin complex receptor to the ileal brush-border membrane. All other nutrients are absorbed normally. In addition, a moderate nonregenerative anemia with marked anisocytosis, occasional megaloblasts, and moderate poikilocytosis, as well as a neutropenia with occasional hypersegmented neutrophils, are noted. Serum cobalamin levels are low, and urine samples contain large amounts of methylmalonic acid. Parenteral, but not oral, administration of vitamin B I2 (0.25 to 1 mg weekly for 1 month, then every 3 to 6 months) reverses all hematologic and clinical abnormalities. Serum cobalamin levels should be monitored every 6 to 12 months or if signs occur. Affected animals should not be bred.\n\nEnteropathy has been identified in Chinese shar-pei dogs that is characterized by poor weight gain or weight loss and bouts of intermittent diarrhea, with an onset of signs typically between 2 and 6 months of age. Small intestinal biopsy samples are necessary for diagnosis; most severe cases show eosinophilic and lymphocyticplasmacytic infiltrates of the intestine. Determination of serum cobalamin and folate concentrations may also be helpful in identifying bacterial overgrowth problems. Elimination diets and immunosuppressive therapy are the most practical approach to treatment. A guarded prognosis is always warranted.\n\nPartial and complete luminal obstructions of the intestine, particularly of the small intestine, are frequently seen in dogs and cats younger than 6 months. Ingested foreign object(s) and intussusception are the most frequent causes of these luminal obstructions.\n\nIngested Foreign Objects. Foreign object(s) ingested by a dog or cat may pass through the pylorus but have difficulty in passing aborally through the intestinal tract, commonly lodging in the jejunum. Foreign objects that are likely to be ingested include stones, coins, pecans, plastic and rubber objects, and jewelry. Whether partial or complete luminal obstruction occurs depends on the shape and size of the foreign object and on whether the object is stationary or is slowly progressing aborally. Once an object is able to pass through the ileocolic junction into the large intestine, signs of obstruction usually abate, and the object passes without complication.\n\nSharp objects (e.g., pins, tacks, needles, wooden or plastic splinters, and even fishhooks) may pass aborally through the intestine of a young dog or cat without evidence of piercing the intestinal wall or lodging within its lumen. If the owner or veterinarian elects not to surgically remove a sharp intestinal foreign object, the animal should be monitored continually for progression of obstructive signs via serial abdominal radiographs to ensure uncomplicated passage of the object. If the foreign object ceases to move, perforation should be suspected, and immediate surgical intervention is warranted. Passage of a sharp object through the ileocolic junction into the large intestine does not necessarily ensure that the object will be eliminated without complications because penetration of the colon or rectum may still occur.\n\nLinear foreign objects present as a peculiar problem because they can cause extensive damage to the intestine (Basher and Fowler, 1987; Felts et aI, 1984) . Large sections of small intestine may be involved, and perforation and secondary peritonitis may occur. Linear foreign objects that are commonly ingested include elastic string, elastic binding from a golf ball, fishing line, cord, shoelaces, dental floss, pantyhose, fabric, and Christmas tree decorations. For a linear foreign object to cause problems, it must become fixed at some cranial site within the alimentary tract. Usually the object is either looped around the base of the tongue or lodged at the pylorus. Intestinal motility then propels the rest of the trailing object in an aboral direction through the intestine. Because the object is fixed cranially, motility of the small intestine is unable to move the luminal object into the large intestine. Consequently, the small intestine moves cranially over the fixed object, with resultant pleating or bunching of the intestine over the linear object, creating a partial or complete intestinal obstruction, multiple perforation sites, and either localized or generalized peritonitis ( Fig. 10-27 ). Cats are much more likely than dogs to ingest linear foreign objects.\n\nDiagnosis. Signs associated with the ingestion of foreign objects are variable and may include vomiting, diarrhea, depression and weakness, dehydration, partial or complete inappetence, abdominal distention, and abdomi- In Ettinger SJ red]: Textbook of Veterinary Internal Medicine, vol 2, 2nd ed. Philadelphia, WB Saunders, 1983 , p 1338 nal pain. Usually, vomiting is the primary sign of a foreign object-induced intestinal 'Obstruction. Luminal obstruction of the duodenum and jejunum (cranial to middle jejunal obstruction) results in immediate, frequent vomiting, whereas distal jejunal, ileal, or colonic obstruction results in less frequent vomiting that may be delayed for several days (Strombeck and Guilford, 1990) . Complete luminal obstruction produces persistent vomiting, whereas partial obstruction usually causes intermittent vomiting. Vomiting increases in frequency as the obstruction progresses. The presence of bile in vomitus suggests that the obstruction is distal to the point where the bile duct enters into the duodenum. Feculent vomitus is indicative of intestinal stasis and lower intestinal obstructions.\n\nDiarrhea often occurs with partial intestinal obstruction but rarely occurs with a complete obstruction. Abdominal pain that may also be present is evidenced by restlessness, unusual posture, or resistance to abdominal palpation. Many foreign objects are detectable during physical examination by gentle, thorough palpation of the abdomen (Strombeck and Guilford, 1990) . It may be possible to repeatedly palpate a foreign object and the distended intestine cranial to the object. Palpation of pleated loops of small intestine warrants a thorough reexamination of the oral cavity, especially at the base of the tongue, for evidence of a linear object being fixed at that site. Occasionally, the linear object may have cut deeply into the base of the tongue, leaving only a reddened ulcerative lesion visible around the frenulum.\n\nThe Digative System I 187 Radiopaque foreign objects are easily found on survey abdominal radiographs (Gomez, 1974) . Gastric distention is usually evident if an obstruction is present. Linear foreign objects appear as gathered small intestinal segments with foci of asymmetric distention and distinctive gas and fluid interphases (see Fig. 10-27 ). Any loss of abdominal detail with or without peritoneal free gas accumulation should heighten suspicion of the presence of intestinal wall perforation. At times, especially with a partial obstruction or radiolucent foreign object, a positive contrast study may be required (Kealy, 1987) . Caution should be exercised when positive contrast material is used; if intestinal perforation is suspected, a water-soluble contrast medium should be used instead of barium sulfate.\n\nTreatment. The primary treatment of a foreign object-induced intestinal obstruction is removal of the obstructing object. However, animals with obstructions are often metabolically unstable. Immediate management is directed toward correcting fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base imbalances and treating any accompanying septicemia and shock (Richardson, 1981) . Intravenous balanced electrolyte fluid therapy, such as lactated Ringer's solution, is started immediately to correct most of the animal's fluid deficits before surgical intervention. At the same time, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents that are effective against the indigenous intestinal microflora, both gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic organisms, are given with the parenteral fluids. A combination of penicillin derivatives or cephalosporins and aminoglycosides is recommended. In uncomplicated for- WB Saunders, 1983 , p 1339 eign object-induced intestinal obstruction with minimal vascular compromise and surgical contamination, antimicrobial therapy is generally required for only the immediate perioperative period, the first 12 to 24 hours. If the obstruction is complicated by shock, devitalized intestine, and peritonitis, however, a longer period of antimicrobial therapy is required.\n\nThe method used for surgical relief of an intestinal obstruction caused by foreign objecns) depends on several factors (Bojrab, 1986) . Small objects can usually be removed through a single enterotomy. The enterotomy should be performed caudal to the obstructing object in healthy tissue to decrease the possibility of postoperative complications due to dehiscence at the enterotomy site. Large foreign objects may require intestinal resection and anastomosis, especially if the intestine is dark and friable (Bojrab, 1986) . When possible, the first step should be to remove the foreign object(s) through a caudal enterotomy and suture the incision. The involved intestinal segment can then be wrapped in a warm, saline-moistened sponge for 3 to 5 minutes. If blood flow and motility do not return to the involved segment after this time, a resection to healthy tissue is warranted.\n\nA short linear foreign object may be removed through a single enterotomy (Richardson, 1981) . If the linear object is long, it should be removed through several small enterotomies along the antimesenteric border. A long linear foreign object should never be removed through a single enterotomy site. While the linear object is being pulled through the single enterotomy, it frequently cuts through the mesenteric border of the intestinal wall. Small perforations must then be debrided and closed and subsequently checked to ensure that they have been satisfactorily closed. It is always important to thoroughly palpate the stomach and the noninvolved intestinal segments for other foreign object(s) after the primary obstructing object(s) have been removed (Bojrab, 1986) .\n\nAfter the intestinal obstruction is relieved, intravenous fluid therapy is continued until oral alimentation can be reinstituted. Oral alimentation is usually started during the first postoperative day. Small amounts of water are offered initially. If vomiting does not occur, a highly digestible food is offered three or four times daily in small amounts. Intestinal motility usually returns to near-normal state by the first or second postoperative day. As oral intake increases, fluid therapy support is gradually decreased. Fluid therapy is not terminated until Thc Digestivc Systcm I 189 the animal is adequately maintaining itself by oral alimentation and obstructive signs have ceased. Evidence of dehiscence at the enterotomy or anastomosis site usually becomes apparent by the second to fourth postoperative day. Failure to eat and other signs of peritonitis such as fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain are suggestive of intestinal dehiscence (Richardson, 1981) . With debilitated animals, serial postoperative CBCs and determinations of blood glucose levels and blood gas and electrolyte determinations should be done. The heart should be monitored daily for the first week after surgery, as cardiac arrhythmias of ventricular origin are not uncommon after intestinal obstruction (Bojrab, 1986) .\n\nIntussusception. Intussusception is also commonly seen as a cause of intestinal obstruction in the young dog and occasionally in the young cat (Wilson and Burt, 1974; Wolfe, 1978) . In addition, an intussusception may occur in a recently born puppy or kitten and contribute to the fading puppy or kitten syndrome. The ileocolic junction is the most common site of intussusception, which also occurs in decreasing frequency in the ileum, jejunum, cecum, and duodenum.\n\nCauses. Abnormal intestinal motility is thought to lead to the development of an intussusception. Irritation of the intestinal mucosa due to disorders such as intestinal parasitism, virus-induced or bacteria-induced enteritis, and acute inflammatory disorders or to orally administered drugs and anthelmintics may contribute to abnormal intestinal motility and the intussusception.\n\nDiagnosis. The presence of a palpable cylindric mass together with abdominal pain, vomiting, and passage of mucus and/or blood in the stool are usually diagnostic. Tenesmus may also occur with the diarrhea. If the intussusception has prolapsed through the anus, it must be differentiated from a rectal prolapse; this is done by passing a finger or blunt probe into the rectum between the mass and rectal wall. If the mass is a prolapsed intussusception, the probe or finger may be inserted a considerable distance. An intussusception is confirmed with abdominal radiographs (Kealy, 1987) . Results of survey radiographs depend on whether the intussusception is causing a complete or a partial obstruction. If the obstruction is complete, dilated gas-filled and fluid-filled loops of intestine are seen cranial to the intussusception, and the colon is void of feces. If the obstruction is par-tial, there is little, if any, distention of the intestine, and feces are usually present in the colon. The intussusception itself may not be seen owing to its fluid density and to the overlapping density of fluid-filled intestine. Probably the better method of demonstrating a nonopaque intussusception is via barium enema (Fig. 10-28 ) (Kealy, 1987) or abdominal ultrasonography.\n\nWhen an intussusception is diagnosed, surgical intervention is warranted. It is also important to determine the inciting cause of the intussusception and to eliminate it, if possible. If the intussusception is due to altered motility secondary to parasite-induced enteritis, the appropriate anthelmintic should be administered. The ability to manually reduce an intus- WB Saunders, 1987, P 93.) susception at surgery depends on its duration ( Fig. 10-29) . One hand is used to hold the ensheathing layer (intussuscipiens), while the other hand pushes the apex of the invaginating layer (intussusceptum) cranially and exerts gentle traction on the intestine cranial to the intussusception (Bojrab, 1986) . After manual reduction of the intussusception, the intestine and mesentery are carefully checked for viability. If the involved segment is nonviable, then that segment should be resected and the remaining ends anastomosed. In intussusceptions of longer duration, manual reduction may be impossible. Adhesions often develop as a result of vascular damage and production of a fibrinous exudate The Digestive System I 191 from the serosal surfaces. With time, the compromised circulation causes an ischemic necrosis and often a localized peritonitis. In those cases in which manual reduction is impossible because of adhesions or if the segment of intestine is no longer viable, resection and anastomosis are warranted (Bojrab, 1986) .\n\nThe most frequent postoperative complication, barring intestinal dehiscence and peritonitis, is the recurrence of the intussusception because of existing intestinal irritation and/or altered motility (Bellenger et aI, 1982; Wolfe, 1977) . This may occur whether manual reduction or intestinal resection was performed. If the intussusception recurs, it may be helpful to double the intestine upon itself so that the portion causing the problem lies at the turn of a V-shaped segment (Engen, 1983) . The serosa of the segments cranial and caudal to the site of the intussusception is sutured together at the antimesenteric border with absorbable suture material. Three loops of plicated bowel should be used cranial and caudal to the intussusception (Fig. 10-30) .\n\nCauses. Fecal impactions resulting from a mixture of feces and nondigestible hair or bones are the most common cause of infrequent defecation in dogs and cats younger than 6 months. Other causes of fecal impaction may include ingested foreign objects, narrowed pelvic canal after traumatically induced fractured pelvis, collapsed pelvic canal associated with pathologic fractures due to nutritional imbalances, and congenital defects and inflammatory disease of the rectum and anus. Of these, foreign objects and fractured pelvis are the more likely causes of fecal impaction.\n\nDiagnosis. Animals with fecal impaction usually have a history of failure to defecate for days. The owner may have observed the animal making frequent, unsuccessful attempts to defecate and, in some cases, straining to pass small amounts of liquid feces, often containing blood or mucus. Some animals have the misleading complaint of diarrhea. The disruption and irritation of the intestinal mucosa promote secretion and accumulation of fluid that cannot penetrate the densely packed fecal materials and thus produce diarrhea. If defecation has not been observed, the animal may be brought to the veterinarian because it is depressed, listless, inappetent or anorexic, and vomiting intermittently (Burrows, 1986) . Animals presenting with fecal impaction are generally dehydrated. Cats may assume a crouching, hunched attitude indicative of abdominal pain, and obvious abdominal distention is observed occasionally. Abdominal palpation typically reveals hard fecal mass(es) that may fill the entire length of the large intestine. Rectal examination combined with abdominal palpation is useful in determining the amount of feces retained and compressibility of the material present and possibly in identifying the underlying cause of the fecal impaction, such as foreign object(s) or a narrowed pelvic canal. Survey abdominal radiographs confirm the presence of fecal impaction and any opaque foreign objecns).\n\nTreatment. The treatment of fecal impaction consists of gentle removal of impacted fecal material and, if possible, identification and removal of the underlying cause (Burrows, 1986) . The animal with mild to moderate fecal impaction can generally be treated with oral laxatives and frequent small-volume enemas. The animal with more severe fecal impaction is often dehydrated and requires fluid replacement therapy for dehydration and electrolyte imbalances before correction of the fecal impaction is attempted. Breakdown and removal of the impacted fecal mass(es) should be accomplished as slowly and gently as possible. It is less traumatic for the young animal if the fecal mass(es) are softened and removed over 2 or 3 days than if removal of all the fecal impaction is attempted at one time. In dogs and cats older than 4 months with mild to moderate fecal impaction, after fluid replacement therapy has been accomplished, oral administration of a colon electrolyte lavage preparation such as Colyte (Reed & Carnrick) or NuLytely (Braintree Laboratories), about 20 to 30 ml/kg body weight every 12 hours, can be used for completing the removal of residual feces.\n\nLaxatives. Laxatives are mild in their effects and usually cause elimination of formed feces. Their effects depend on dosage; major drugs and dosages are presented in Table 10 -4. The dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate and dioctyl calcium sulfosuccinate laxatives act as detergents to alter the surface tension of liquids and promote emulsification and softening of the feces by facilitating the mixture of water and fat. The animal should be well hydrated before compounds containing these substances are administered (Burrows, 1986) . They should not be administered in conjunction with mineral oil, because they aid in the absorption of the mineral oil.\n\nMineral oil (liquid petrolatum) and white petrolatum are nondigestible and poorly absorbed laxatives. They soften feces by coating them to prevent colonic absorption of fecal water and promote easy evacuation. A small amount of oil absorption does occur, but the primary danger of giving mineral oil is laryngotracheal aspiration. Bulk-forming laxatives such as psyllium and bran increase the frequency of evacuation of the upper large intestine via stimulation produced by added bulk or volume. They soften feces by the retention of water (Burrows, 1986) . Metamucil, which contains natural psyllium and generic bran, is best given with moistened food to ensure a high degree of water intake.\n\nAnother useful laxativeis bisacodyl; this compound exerts its action on colonic mucosa and intramural nerve plexuses (Burrows, 1986) . It should be given only to well-hydrated animals older than 4 months and is contraindicated when obstruction is present. Lactulose, a synthetic disaccharide of galactose and fructose, may be used for its laxative effects in the young dog and cat. After oral administration, lactulose is metabolized to organic acids by intestinal bacteria and promotes an osmotic catharsis of feces. The dose is individualized on the basis of stool consistency and is titrated until a semiformed stool is obtained, two to three soft bowel movements per day. Overdosage may induce intestinal cramping (colic signs), profuse diarrhea, flatulence, dehydration, and acidosis.\n\nEnemas. Enemas act by softening feces in the distal region of the large intestine, stimulating colonic motility and the urge to defecate. The enema fluid used should be at room temperature or tepid. Tap water, normal saline solution, and sodium biphosphate solution add bulk; petrolatum oils soften, lubricate, and promote the evacuation of hardened fecal material; and\n\nThe Digestive System I 193 soap-sud solutions promote defecation by their irritant action (Burrows, 1986) . Tepid normal saline solution and tap water (about 5 mllkg body weight) are generally preferred for enemas in animals younger than 6 months. If these are ineffective, a soapy water solution can be used after ensuring that the animal is well hydrated. About 5 mllkg body weight of a mild soap solution is slowly instilled through a lubricated enema tube. In general, better results with normal saline solution, tap water, or soapy water enemas are obtained if the enema is repeated several times using small volumes. Small volumes are retained for longer periods, allowing time to soften and break down fecal impactions. Sodium phosphate retention enemas are convenient preparations for the relief of fecal impaction. Their use in young dogs and cats is absolutely contraindicated, however, in that they cause marked hyperphosphatemia, hypernatremia, and hypocalcemia (Atkins, 1986) .\n\nPrevention. After the successful relief of fecal impaction, attention is directed to the prevention of recurrence. If possible, nondigestible materials should be eliminated from the diet, regular grooming instituted, and the opportunity for regular defecation provided. In all instances, the goal should be to have the animal pass soft, formed feces and to defecate regularly. Commercial veterinary laxatives containing petrolatum as their active ingredient are useful for preventing minor hair impaction in cats.\n\nCause. Rectal prolapse is the protrusion of one or more layers of the rectum from the anal orifice. The degree of rectal prolapse can vary, from protrusion of the mucosal layer at the anal orifice to full-thickness extrusion of several centimeters of the rectum through the anal orifice. Rectal prolapse commonly occurs in dogs and cats that are experiencing habitual or continual straining; therefore, obvious causes of straining to void feces or urine should be evaluated. Any defect in the supporting structures of the anorectum or disturbance of the anal sphincters such as innervation disorders will predispose the dog or cat to a rectal prolapse. In dogs and cats younger than 6 months, rectal prolapses of only the mucosal layer are most often associated with severe diarrhea. Soiling of the perianal area and diarrhea may create considerable straining to void feces and result in a rectal prolapse of the mucosa. Foreign objects, such as needles or bones, that lodge in the rectum may also contribute to severe straining, leading to rectal prolapse of the mucosa. If the underlying cause of a rectal prolapse is not eliminated, the prolapsed mucosa may quickly convert into a full-thickness extrusion of the rectum.\n\nDiagnosis. A rectal prolapse of only the mucosal layer assumes a swollen donut shape as it protrudes from the anal orifice. If all the layers are involved, the prolapsed rectum takes on a more cylindric shape. A rectal prolapse can be mistaken for a rare intussusception of a more cranial section of the intestine that has prolapsed through the anal orifice. Differentiation between rectal prolapse and intussusception is made by attempting to insert a finger or blunt probe between the mucocutaneous junction of the anus and protruding bowel. If the finger or blunt probe is easily passed, an intussusception is present; if resistance is met, a rectal prolapse has occurred (Seim, 1986) . Treatment. A rectal prolapse does not occur without cause. Failure to identify and treat the underlying cause of rectal prolapse often results in its unsuccessful treatment. The initial treatment should include fluid replacement therapy for dehydration and electrolyte disturbances, symptomatic control of diarrhea, and administration of appropriate medication in the case of parasitic or bacterial enterocolitis. The rectal prolapse itself can be managed by several methods, including reduction and purse-string suture, amputation, and colopexy (Seim, 1986) . The method selected depends on the viability of the prolapsed tissue, the size and reducibility of the prolapse, and recurrence after a previous method has failed. Edematous but viable prolapsed tissue appears moist and varies from pink to dark red. Mucosa that is irreversibly damaged or necrotic appears leather-like and may be purple or black. With the animal under general anesthesia, a minor rectal prolapse of viable mucosa may be reduced manually and maintained by a purse-string suture in the anus for about 7 days, leaving a small orifice for stool passage. The small orifice is created by drawing the purse-string suture closed around a 4-inch rectal thermometer or another object of similar diameter. Desiccants such as hypertonic solutions of glucose or granulated sugar can be applied on the prolapsed tissue to reduce the edema before reduction and placement of the purse-string suture. Topical anesthetic ointment with 1% dibucaine can be instilled in the rectum postoperatively and continued for 2 or 3 days after removal of the purse-string suture (Seim, 1986) .\n\nA nonreducible rectal prolapse with necrosis of the mucosa is best managed by full-thickness amputation and anastomosis. A nonreducible viable prolapse or a recurrent rectal prolapse that fails to respond to more conservative treatment may be treated by celiotomy and colopexy (Seim, 1986) . For the colopexy, scarified surfaces of the descending colon and the sublumbar body wall are sutured together with several interrupted mattress stitches of nonabsorbable suture material, attaching the submucosal layer of the colon to the muscles of the abdominal wall. Topical anesthetic ointment is instilled rectally after colopexy and continued for 5 or 6 days postoperatively.\n\nCongenital anorectal anomalies that are infrequently identified in the young dog and cat include imperforate anus, segmental aplasia, rectovaginal fistula, rectovestibular fistula, anovaginal cleft, and rectal urethral fistula (Osborne et al, 1975; Rawlings, 1977; Rawlings and Capps, 1971j Seim, 1986; Wilson and Clifford, 1975) . Of these anomalies, imperforate anus, although rarely seen, is the most common. Puppies or kittens with congenital anorectal anomalies usually are presented to a veterinarian because of an absence of defecation, obvious defect in the anatomy of the perineal structures, or voiding of urine or feces through an inappropriate orifice (Chambers, 1986) . A distended abdomen often accompanies these anomalies if obstruction is present. The anorectal anomalies occasionally go unnoticed until the animal is several weeks old and may not be readily apparent from the appearance of the perineum.\n\nOften with the imperforate anus, an anal dimple is present ventral to the base of the tail, showing where the anal orifice should have been. The colon is distended with feces and gas if any degree of obstruction is present, and fecal impaction may be severe enough to cause abdominal distention. The presence or absence of voluntary bladder function and an external anal sphincter should be evaluated in the animal presenting with imperforate anus. The presence and function of the external anal sphincter muscle can be evaluated by pinching the bulb of the penis or vulva and watching carefully for an anal wink (bulbourethral reflex) (Oliver and Selcer, 1974) . If the sphincter is present and functional, the prognosis for surgical correction is much better.\n\nImperforate anus encompasses several types of congenital deformity (Seim, 1986) . Imperforate anus type 1 results from a failure of perforation of the anal membrane. Treatment consists of simply rupturing the membrane and trimming the excess tissue. A 4-inch rectal thermometer is used to ensure that the anal opening is adequate. Imperforate anus type 2 (also referred to as atresia ant) results from failure of the cloacal membrane to rupture, leaving a relatively thick membrane covering the anal orifice ( Fig. 10-31) . The anal sphincter is usually intact and functional. Treatment is directed at locating the anal dimple, dissecting the membrane to the level of the rectal mucosa, and suturing the mucosa to the subcutaneous tissue and skin. A convenient way of excising the anal membrane and exposing the underlying rectum is to make two incisions at right angles to each other, forming a \"+\" centered on the anal dimple (Chambers, 1986) . The four angled skin flaps thus formed are undermined and excised. The subcutaneous tissue is bluntly separated, and the blind-ended rectum is isolated and gently pulled toward the anus with forceps or stay sutures. The end of the rectum is then incised, and the mucosa is apposed to the skin with simple, interrupted stitches of absorbable. suture material. The Digestive System I 195 Imperforate anus type 3 (also referred to as rectal agenesis) results when the rectum ends blindly at a variable distance from the anal membrane. A lateral abdominal radiograph with the animal's hindquarters slightly elevated will allow visual observation of gas in the termination of the rectum (Seim, 1986) . The distance from the rectum to the anal membrane allows differentiation between imperforate anus types 2 and 3. Treatment requires a combined abdominal and perineal surgical approach (Seim, 1986) . The distal region of the rectum is exposed abdominally and then delivered through the pelvic canal to an opening made in the anal dimple. Rectal mucosa is then sutured to the subcutaneous tissue and skin in the perianal region. Animals may remain fecal incontinent after surgical correction.\n\nImperforate anus may be associated with other anorectal anomalies, especially of the genitourinary tract, with the rectum opening into the vagina, urinary bladder, or urethra ( Fig. 10 -32) (Rawlings and Capps, 1971; Suess et al, 1992) . The age and size of a dog or cat with imperforate anus or its combination of concurrent anorectal anomalies make surgical correction difficult because of the complications that may occur postoperatively. The prognosis is good if the animal survives the immediate postoperative period (Greiner, 1972) .\n\nCorrection of anovaginal and rectovaginal fistulas that are predominately cosmetic problems should be delayed until the puppy or kitten is 12 to 16 weeks of age (Chambers, 1986) . Contrast radiography is needed to establish the presence and position of fistulas between the anorectum and urogenital tract before surgical correction is attempted. Fistulas require lengthy dissection procedures and general anesthesia. Most of these fistulas can be isolated through a vertical midline perineal incision from the ventral region of the anus to the vulva (Chambers, 1986) . Gentle blunt dissection is used to separate the supporting tissue between the rectum and urogenital tract. Once isolated, the fistula is excised, and the lumina of the anorectum and urogenital tract are closed separately with simple interrupted stitches of 4-0 or 5-0 synthetic absorbable suture material. If the anorectum is malpositioned, it is relocated in the center of the external anal sphincter muscle, and the mucosa is sutured to the skin circumferentially with simple interrupted stitches of the same suture material. The fecal impaction is relieved manu-ally and with judicious use of enemas. The large intestine often is atonic and may require intermittent evacuation until normal defecation is established. "}
