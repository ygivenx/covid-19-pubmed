{"title": "Viral causes of Influenza Like Illness in Uganda, 2008 to\n2017.", "body": "To determine viral causes of influenza-like illness in Uganda.\n\nRespiratory pathogens continue to present an ever increasing threat to public health\n(1,2). Influenza, Respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and other\nrespiratory viruses are major etiological agents for influenza like illnesses (ILI)\n(3-5). Establishment of viral causes of ILI is critical for prevention and\nmitigation strategies to disease threats. Makerere University Walter Reed Project\n(MUWRP) together with the Ugandan Ministry of Health and partners undertook\nsurveillance to determine viral causes of influenza-like illness in Uganda.\n\nFrom 2008, MUWRP established hospital-based sentinel sites for surveillance\nactivities. A total of five hospital-based sites were established, where patients\naged 6 months or older presenting with ILI were enrolled. Consents were obtained as\nrequired, and a throat and/ or nasopharyngeal swab collected. Samples were screened\nby PCR for viral causes.\n\nFrom October 2008 to March 2017 a total of 9,472 participants were enrolled in the\nstudy from five hospital-based surveillance sentinel sites. Majority of participants\nwere children under 5 years n= 8,169 (86.2%). 615 (6.5%) samples tested positive for\ninfluenza A, while 385 (4.1%) tested positive for influenza B viruses and 10 (0.1%)\nwere co-infections between influenza A and B. Of the 2,062 influenza negative\nsamples, results indicated positivity for the following organisms; adenoviruses\n(9.4%), respiratory syncytial B (7.3%), parainfluenza-3 (4.5%), parainfluenza-1\n(4.3%), respiratory syncytial A (3.5%), human bocavirus (1.7%), human\nmetapneumovirus (1.7%), human coronavirus (1.5%), parainfluenza-4 (1.4%) and\nparainfluenza-2 (0.9%) by PCR.\n\nInfluenza viruses account for about 11% of the causes of influenza like illness, with\ninfluenza A being the dominant type. Among the other viral causes of ILI,\nadenoviruses were the most dominant. Detection of other viral causes of ILI is an\nindication of the public health threats posed by respiratory pathogens."}
