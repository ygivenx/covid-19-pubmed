{"title": "", "body": "\u2022 Diarrhea may be defined as a change in the frequency, consistency or volume of bowel movements. \u2022 The four recognized pathophysiologic mechanisms that cause diarrhea include osmotic, secretory, increased permeability and altered motility. \u2022 Osmotic diarrhea and conditions causing increased permeability are believed to be the most common causes of diarrhea. \u2022 Classification of diarrhea by characteristics that tend to be more prevalent in small vs. large intestinal disease is a helpful way to develop an appropriate diagnostic and treatment regimen. Small bowel diarrhea is characterized by: \u2022 Loose to watery feces. \u2022 Increased volume of feces. \u2022 Normal to increased frequency of defecation. \u2022 No or little straining or tenesmus associated with defecation.\n\n\u2022 If blood is present in feces it occurs as melena. \u2022 No increase in mucus on the feces. \u2022 Weight loss and vomiting are commonly observed concurrently.\n\n\u2022 The small intestinal tract (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) is the site of origin of the diarrhea.\n\nHowever, diseases in other body systems may cause diarrhea in an otherwise normal intestinal tract (e.g. liver disease, hyperthyroidism, etc.).\n\n\u2022 Chronic small bowel diarrhea is a clinical sign that should be aggressively evaluated to determine its cause. \u2022 Cats with chronic diarrhea of small intestinal origin may have any of a number of GI or systemic diseases or disorders, but metabolic (hyperthyroidism, renal or liver disease, etc.), idiopathic (inflammatory bowel disease), neoplastic (lymphoma), and nutritional (food allergy or intolerance) are common causes. These are rare disorders that are most commonly found in the jejunum, and may be subclinical or associated with vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain.\n\n\u2022 Intussusception (p 756)\n\nAcute onset of diarrhea may occur due to alterations in gut motility, however, vomiting is a more prominent clinical sign.\n\n\u2022 Short bowel syndrome (p 760)\n\nThis iatrogenic syndrome is associated with resection of 75-90% of the small intestine and results in severe diarrhea and weight loss. Congenital forms of short bowel syndrome are reported, but are rare.\n\n\u2022 Hyperthyroidism* (p 743) Intermittent diarrhea, vomiting or voluminous stools in an older cat with a good to ravenous appetite, obvious weight loss and a poorly groomed coat are characteristic of this disease.\n\nThis is a rare disease in cats, but is typically associated with small bowel diarrhea, weight loss and a ravenous appetite.\n\n\u2022 Hypoadrenocorticism (p 754)\n\nThe classic signs include depression, weakness, vomiting and diarrhea. However, GI signs do not occur in all cases, and the cause of the vomiting or diarrhea is unknown. Some cats will not develop concurrent mineralocorticoid deficiency with the glucocorticoid deficiency, and thus electrolyte disturbances will not be apparent.\n\nThis is the most common neoplasm of the feline intestine, and because of the lymphocytic infiltrate and clinical presentation, is easily confused with IBD. Most cats with alimentary lymphoma are FeLV antigen negative. Aggressive chemotherapy is the only effective treatment, and may result in a 3-12-month survival time.\n\n\u2022 Intestinal adenocarcinoma (p 750)\n\nThe intestinal tract is a much less common location for adenocarcinoma than the colon in cats. This tumor is the second most common intestinal tumor and tends to cause obstructive lesions of the ileum that frequently cause vomiting, but may also be associated with diarrhea. Siamese cats may be predisposed.\n\n\u2022 Intestinal mast cell tumor (p 753)\n\nIntestinal mast cell tumors are the third most common neoplasm affecting the feline small bowel, but are rare occurrences. This tumor is aggressive, poorly responsive to therapy and usually has metastasized by the time of diagnosis.\n\ncontinued \u2022 Other small intestinal neoplasia (fibrosarcoma, carcinoids, plasmacytoma) (p 757)\n\nOther malignant and benign neoplasms that may be associated with vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss or anorexia in cats include fibrosarcoma, plasmacytoma, hemangiosarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, etc. Clinical signs and prognosis are dependent on the location of the tumor, the type of tumor and its response to therapy. Tumors of the duodenum are rare and usually associated with extension of a local neoplasm.\n\n\u2022 APUDomas (p 758)\n\nNeoplasms of APUD cells are rare tumors in the cat. They include insulinomas, gastrinomas, pheochromocytomas and carcinoid tumors of the GI tract. Clinical signs will depend on the tumor type, but carcinoid tumors are most likely to cause diarrhea.\n\nFood intolerance is a non-immune-mediated condition associated with intermittent diarrhea or vomiting, with no pattern or association with eating, and it resolves when the food source is changed to omit the offending substance from diet. The clinical significance of food intolerance is unknown relative to other causes of diarrhea because of the difficulty in obtaining a definitive diagnosis.\n\nChronic vomiting appears to be more common than diarrhea in cats with food allergy, and cutaneous signs may also be present.\n\nIBD is a chronic inflammatory disease of the GI tract of unknown etiology. It affects cats of all ages, sexes and breeds, but is most commonly found in middle-aged, purebred adult cats. Lymphocytic plasmacytic enteritis is the most common histologic form of IBD, but eosinophilic and suppurative infiltrates occur as well.\n\n\u2022 Inflammatory hepatobiliary disease (cholangitis) (p 746)\n\nThe clinical presentation of cholangitis is non-specific and presenting signs include anorexia, lethargy, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, hepatomegaly and icterus.\n\nViral:\n\n\u2022 Feline coronavirus infections (feline enteric coronavirus/feline infectious peritonitis) (p 749)\n\nFeline enteric coronavirus results in mild, self-limiting diarrhea or subclinical infection. In FIP, the GI tract is rarely affected singularly, and so, vomiting or diarrhea is often associated with the effects of the disease on other organs. Rarely, FIP causes intestinal granulomas that obstruct the GI tract and cause vomiting or diarrhea. Systemic signs of FIP may include lethargy, anorexia, pyrexia and CNS signs.\n\nDiarrhea is not a common presenting sign of cats with FIV, but diarrhea can occur secondary to the immunodeficiency disease or result from a purulent form of colitis that can occur in a small number of cats that are infected with FIV.\n\ncontinued Bacterial:\n\n\u2022 Clostridium perfringens enterocolitis/clostridial enterocolitis (p 748)\n\nDiarrhea occurs due to sporulation of clostridial organisms and release of enterotoxin resulting in a secretory diarrhea that is usually small bowel in character, but may also have a large bowel component.\n\n\u2022 Campylobacteriosis (p 750)\n\nCampylobacter infection may cause mucoid, bloody diarrhea, weight loss, anorexia and fever in affected kittens or young cats. Most affected cats are from shelters or catteries that have crowded conditions and poor hygiene.\n\n\u2022 Giardiasis* (p 744)\n\nAcute or chronic small bowel diarrhea is the most common clinical presentation. However, in some cats large bowel diarrhea also may occur.\n\n\u2022 Histoplasmosis (p 755)\n\nDiarrhea associated with intestinal histoplasmosis is uncommon in cats compared to dogs. The most common clinical signs in cats are associated with respiratory infection, or anorexia, fever and weight loss associated with systemic illness.\n\n\u2022 Coccidiosis (isosporosis, cryptosporidiosis, toxoplasmosis)** (p 741)\n\nInfections that result in mild to moderate diarrhea are most common in neonates and immunosuppressed adults. Most adults have asymptomatic infestations. The species of coccidia most commonly associated with disease in cats are Cystoisospora spp., Cryptosporidium parvum, and occasionally Toxoplasma gondii. Toxoplasmosis has recently been observed in association with IBD.\n\n\u2022 Idiopathic juvenile diarrhea (p 753)\n\nThis condition is associated with small bowel diarrhea and occurs in kittens or young cats less than a year of age. There is no known cause for the diarrhea and when the cat reaches adulthood, the diarrhea resolves.\n\nChronic small intestinal diarrhea is distinct from acute diarrhea, in that the disease or disturbance causing the problem is not self-limiting.\n\nDiarrhea is the most consistent manifestation of intestinal disease.\n\nIn cats with small bowel diarrhea for > 3 weeks duration, an aggressive search for the cause should be undertaken.\n\n\u2022 Large volume of watery or very soft feces.\n\n\u2022 No mucus or hematochezia, and if blood is present it occurs as melena. \u2022 There is little or no straining or tenesmus. \u2022 Weight loss and vomiting are commonly observed. \u2022 The frequency of defecation is normal to increased.\n\nDiarrhea occurs when there is an increase in fecal water, which can occur due to a variety of small or large intestinal disorders, but has been generally grouped into four categories: osmotic, permeability, secretory and motility disturbances.\n\nChronic diarrhea due to increased osmotically active substances present in the lumen is usually associated with GI malabsorption syndromes (EPI, liver failure, severe small intestinal disease, lymphangiectasia, etc.) or dietary overload.\n\nIncreased secretion of water and electrolytes is usually a cause of acute small bowel diarrhea, which occurs primarily as a result of activation of cellular second messenger pathways (cAMP, cGMP, etc.) by enteric pathogens. Conditions that cause diarrhea by increasing secretory mechanisms include bacterial infections with enterotoxigenic or endotoxin-producing species, the presence of unconjugated bile acids in the small bowel or increased secretion due to endocrine tumors.\n\nThe presence of increased intestinal permeability due to inflammation, erosion/ulceration or necrosis is also an important cause of both acute and chronic diarrhea. Inflammatory bowel disease, lymphatic obstruction (due to lymphangiectasia or mucosal inflammation), systemic diseases that alter GI blood flow or mucosal integrity, neoplasia, enteric pathogens and parasites, and toxins may all produce diarrhea by this mechanism.\n\nAltered intestinal motility, either increased or decreased segmentation or propulsion movements will cause diarrhea. Unfortunately, evaluation of intestinal motility is a difficult process, and differentiating cause from effect in motility problems even more challenging. Diarrhea due to intestinal motility disturbances may be caused by stagnant loop syndrome, dysautonomia, ileus, loss of segmentation or peristalsis due to drugs, toxins, etc.\n\nChronic small bowel diarrhea is often a sign of a serious small intestinal disease (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, neoplasia, lymphangiectasia, severe food intolerance, or a chronic infectious disease) which should be thoroughly investigated.\n\nHowever, systemic disorders such as EPI, renal failure, liver disease and some endocrinopathies (e.g. hyperthyroidism, APUD tumors and hypoadrenocorticism) will also cause chronic diarrhea and should not be overlooked.\n\nSmall bowel diarrhea can be the result of disease in the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) or occur secondary to organ failure (hepatic, renal or pancreatic disease) or endocrinopathies (hyperthyroidism, hypoadrenocorticism, or rarely APUD tumors).\n\nA careful history and physical examination will determine whether the problem is likely related to the GI tract or a systemic problem.\n\nDiagnostic tests that will aid localization of the problem include a hemogram, chemistry profile, fecal analysis, intestinal function studies (fTLI, cob/folate) and abdominal imaging studies (radiographs or ultrasound).\n\nCats with small bowel diarrhea of a chronic nature often have severe intestinal disease (neoplasia, inflammatory bowel disease), or systemic illness/organ failure (hepatitis, pancreatic disease such as EPI or hyperthyroidism).\n\nDiagnosis is based upon history and physical examination findings, radiography, hematology and serum chemistry profiles, serology if indicated for FeLV/FIV, etc., serum TLI, fecal analysis, including cytology or alpha-1 protease inhibitor testing, and histopathology. \n\nFood allergy is an adverse reaction to food that has a proven immunologic component.\n\nGastrointestinal signs are variable, but can include vomiting, diarrhea, flatulence, weight loss or anorexia. Diarrhea can be profuse and watery suggesting small bowel disease, or mucoid and hemorrhagic, consistent with colitis. The true incidence of GI signs associated with food sensitivity is unknown.\n\nSigns tend to occur suddenly after the animal has been on a particular diet for months or years.\n\nThere may also be dermatologic signs, such as pruritus, alopecia, miliary dermatitis, seborrhea, pustules, etc., which affect the head, face, ears and inner thigh especially, and are non-seasonal in occurrence.\n\nDermatologic signs need not be present to attribute GI signs to food allergy.\n\nRespiratory tract hypersensitivity is reported in humans but is poorly documented in cats. However, the propensity for cats to develop airway hypersensitivity may warrant further consideration of this possibility.\n\nMost cats are young adults when signs first develop, but the signs can occur in any age, breed or sex of cat.\n\nThe definitive diagnosis of food allergy is only obtained by feeding an elimination diet. The signs will resolve after 6-9 weeks (there is usually a clinical response within 1-3 weeks), with reintroduction of the offending diet resulting in the reappearance of signs within 4-10 days.\n\nOther diagnostic tests, including intradermal skin testing, ELISA testing, RAST testing, and gastroscopic food testing have all been tried in an attempt to find easier methods of making the diagnosis. However, all of these tests are fraught with false-negative and -positive results that limit their usefulness. The only reliable test currently available is the food elimination trial, which is also used in humans.\n\nIn most cats, the hemogram and chemistry profile will be completely normal or have mild non-specific changes associated with inflammation (e.g. eosinophilia, proteinuria).\n\nThe elimination diet chosen to make the diagnosis will depend on the cat's preferences for food, the owner's willingness to make homemade foods, and the clinical situation. However, the best elimination diet is a diet containing a single, novel protein source (turkey, venison, duck, rabbit, ostrich, kangaroo, crocodile, whitefish, etc.) and a single, novel carbohydrate source (rice, potato, etc.) , with no other additives except a pet vitamin. Use either a commercial hypoallergenic diet or a homemade diet (see page 741, Food intolerance, for details).\n\nIntestinal biopsies will have mild to severe infiltrates of inflammatory cells, which may be lymphocytic, plasmacytic or eosinophilic or a combination of those cell types. There is currently no way to differentiate the inflammatory infiltrates present in cats with food allergy from those typically seen in cats with IBD.\n\nThe presence of dermatologic signs suggests that atopy and flea allergy as well as other dermatologic conditions should be considered.\n\nSome cats will have GI signs only, and thus other differentials such as food intolerance, parasites, and metabolic or neoplastic diseases should be considered. Inflammatory bowel disease is also a disease that mimics food allergy and is very difficult to differentiate from it.\n\nOnce an elimination diet has been identified that successfully relieves the clinical signs, the cat should remain on that diet indefinitely. However, it is best to try to identify a commercial diet that most closely resembles the elimination diet so that the cat receives a nutritionally complete and balanced diet. Most homemade elimination diets are not nutritionally balanced and are not suitable for long-term maintenance.\n\nCats may develop a hypersensitivity to any diet, including the so-called hypoallergenic diet, and in that situation, another novel protein source will need to be selected.\n\nMost cats with food allergy only respond partially or do not respond at all to prednisolone therapy or antihistamines.\n\nThe importance of preventing access to any food other than the elimination diet should be emphasized to the owners.\n\n\u2022 Signs may range from intermittent vomiting or diarrhea to pruritus, dermatitis and other dermatologic signs.\n\nSee main reference on page 669, Food sensitivity in \"The Cat With Signs of Chronic Vomiting\" for details.\n\nAdverse reactions to foods may be dermatologic or gastrointestinal and the percentage of signs associated with either component is unknown.\n\nIntermittent to persistent vomiting (usually < 1 day) or diarrhea are the most common GI signs. Flatulence and weight loss may occur.\n\nDermatologic signs may include pruritus, dermatitis or alopecia.\n\nIn contrast to food allergy, food intolerance is a nonimmunologic reaction, and can occur on the first exposure to the offending food or additive. A wide variety of food ingredients may be responsible.\n\nThe relative occurrence of GI versus dermatologic signs and the importance of one or the other in the diagnosis of food intolerance is unknown. However, a combination of dermatologic and GI signs should raise the index of suspicion of a food-related problem.\n\nThere is no diagnostic test for this problem other than to observe a beneficial response to an appropriate dietary trial for 1 week. Resolution of clinical signs is often apparent within 4 days.\n\nThe best elimination diet to obtain a diagnosis is made from a single novel protein and novel carbohydrate source with no added colors or preservatives. For the homemade diet, boiled white rice or potato (1/3 cup) and a novel meat source that the cat has not previously eaten (2/3 cups venison, rabbit, duck, ostrich, crocodile, kangaroo, tofu, turkey, whitefish, etc.) are good options. Use food intended for human consumption, not pet meat.\n\nAlternatively, a commercially available hypoallergenic diet made from a single novel protein or protein hydrolysate is also a useful test diet. Once a diagnosis of food sensitivity (food intolerance or food allergy) has been made, a commercial hypoallergenic diet containing novel protein and carbohydrate sources should be used for long-term maintenance, as homemade diets are rarely balanced and complete.\n\nIntestinal biopsies from cats with food intolerance may be normal, or may have mild to moderate infiltrates of lymphocytes, plasma cells or eosinophils, depending on the duration of intolerance and severity of clinical signs.\n\nIntermittent but unrelenting vomiting in an otherwise healthy cat suggests gastrointestinal motility disturbance, gastric parasites, early inflammatory bowel disease or antral pyloric hypertrophy.\n\nIn cats where diarrhea is the presenting sign or occurs in addition to vomiting, hyperthyroidism, chronic pancreatitis, early renal or liver disease, and other primary GI abnormalities such as neoplasia or intermittent intussusception, must be considered.\n\nChange to a diet that does not contain the offending substance. This may be as simple as changing from a grocery store brand to a premium brand food (or vice versa), but also may require changing to a hypoallergenic food diet (e.g. IVD's Limited Antigen diets, Hill's d/d or z/d, Eukanuba Response formula, Royal Canin Select Protein) or in some cases, formulating a homemade diet that is complete and nutritionally balanced.\n\nSince the abnormal gastrointestinal response is nonimmunologic, use of oral prednisolone is not likely to be beneficial.\n\n\u2022 In young cats or kittens acute small bowel diarrhea occurs. \n\nThe principal clinical sign of coccidiosis is acute small bowel diarrhea, which may be bloody, mucoid or watery. It usually occurs in young cats or kittens as acute diarrhea, but may persist and present as chronic diarrhea. In severely affected kittens, weight loss, anorexia and dehydration may also occur.\n\nOther signs that may be observed include vomiting, weight loss, lethargy and dehydration.\n\nAdult cats that are infected with coccidian parasites (including cryptosporidia) are typically asymptomatic.\n\nYoung or immunocompromised cats with cryptosporidiosis will have profuse, watery diarrhea and mesenteric lymphadenopathy due to intestinal hypersecretion and malabsorption.\n\nToxoplasma infections are also rarely associated with diarrhea, but in cats with immunocompromise or other significant bowel conditions (e.g. IBD), quiescent toxoplasmosis may be re-activated and cause clinical signs.\n\nDiagnosis is made by identification of isosporoid oocysts in fresh feces.\n\nThe oocysts of cryptosporidia are 1/10th the size of Isospora (smaller than RBCs and 1/16th the size of a Toxocara cyst). Toxoplasma oocysts are only slightly larger.\n\nSpecial flotation media (Sheather's sugar or zinc sulfate flotation) is required along with special staining (Kinyoun's carbolfuchsin negative) or phase contrast microscopy, to identify cryptosporidia.\n\nOther methods of identification of fecal cryptosporidia include an ELISA test, but its effectiveness in identifying feline species of cryptosporidia is unknown. A PCR test for Cryptosporidium DNA in the feces, or electron microscopy of intestinal biopsy samples may also be used.\n\nFecal samples submitted to the laboratory for identification of cryptosporidia should be preserved in formalin to minimize the risk of human infection.\n\nToxoplasma titers (both IgG and IgM) can be submitted to determine the presence of acute, chronic or previous infections. See main reference on page 958.\n\n\u2022 Chronic, progressive weight loss, anorexia, diarrhea and/or vomiting. \u2022 More common in middle aged to older cats.\n\nSee main reference on page 317 for details.\n\nChronic, progressive weight loss, anorexia, diarrhea and/or vomiting are the most common signs.\n\nLymphoma commonly causes diffuse intestinal thickening due to infiltrative disease, but sometimes there are focal areas of intestinal constriction due to mass lesions or luminal constriction.\n\nPalpable thickening or mesenteric lymphadenopathy may be important clues to the problem.\n\nThe history and clinical signs may be too non-specific to be of particular help.\n\nPalpable intestinal thickening or mesenteric lymphadenopathy is suggestive of neoplasia, but does not rule out other possible causes, such as inflammatory bowel disease, alimentary histoplasmosis or other infectious intestinal diseases (FIP, FIV, severe giardiasis).\n\nHemogram and chemistry profile results may be normal or will reveal non-specific abnormalities such as chronic non-regenerative anemia, hyper-or hypoproteinemia, elevations in liver enzyme concentrations, hypercalcemia or abnormal electrolytes due to vomiting or diarrhea.\n\nImaging studies, especially abdominal ultrasound, are important in identifying and localizing intestinal abnormalities. Fine-needle aspirates of lymph nodes or affected segments of bowel may point toward the diagnosis.\n\nThe key to diagnosis is identification of neoplastic lymphocytes in the intestinal mucosa or wall. This may be achieved by fine-needle aspirates, endoscopic brush cytology or histopathology. Endoscopic biopsies are an excellent method of obtaining tissue for diagnosis, but the biopsies must be of good quality to be useful. Samples must include mucosa and muscularis layers, and extend to the submucosa to be diagnostic.\n\nIn cats with early, or very well-differentiated lymphosarcoma, it may be impossible to distinguish lymphoma from severe IBD, even with full-thickness biopsy samples. In these cases, immunohistochemistry will be required to separate monoclonal neoplastic cells from the polyclonal cell of IBD. Unfortunately, this technique is currently available at only a few institutions.\n\nThe primary differential for alimentary lymphoma, both clinically and diagnostically, is lymphocytic plasmacytic inflammatory bowel disease. However, other important differentials include food intolerance/allergy and severe giardiasis, and systemic diseases such as cholangitis and hyperthyroidism.\n\nThe best approach is to use multiple-agent chemotherapy, using a treatment regimen of stages: (1) induction of remission, (2) intensification, (3) maintenance and (4) rescue.\n\nCats treated with prednisolone alone may improve initially, but once the tumor escapes remission, it is very difficult to re-induce remission.\n\nThere are several protocols available, but the COAP protocol is commonly used to induce remission. C = cyclophosphamide, O = vincristine (oncovin), A = cytosine arabinoside, P = prednisolone. The induction protocol generally takes 6-8 weeks, and side effects with this protocol are minimal. The dose-limiting toxicity is hematologic, and thus, weekly hemograms are required before each treatment. Specific dosing protocols are described in detail under alimentary lymphoma in the chronic vomiting section.\n\nIntensification is only used if the induction phase does not result in complete remission of the tumor.\n\nThe most common agents used for intensification in cats are doxorubricin or mitoxantrone.\n\nThe COAP protocol is also used for maintenance in cats, but the treatments are spread out to every other week or every third week for six treatments, with the goal to be able to maintain the cat with treatment once every 4 weeks. Maintenance therapy is continued until the tumor relapses.\n\nRescue, or re-induction of remission, is necessary in almost all cats and generally occurs 6-8 months after the start of induction. Rescue protocols are not as successful in cats as they are in dogs. There have been a wide variety of protocols recommended, and the reader is referred to an oncology text for further details. In most cases, the rescue protocol will involve mitoxantrone, doxorubicin and the other COAP drugs. See the alimentary lymphoma section under chronic vomiting for specific protocol details.\n\nMost (80%) cats with lymphoma treated with multipleagent chemotherapy protocols are expected to live 3-9 months. As many as 20% will live for longer than 1 year.\n\nCats that are not treated will live for 4-8 weeks.\n\nFeline leukemia-positive cats have a shorter survival time, not because they do not respond to chemotherapy, but due to development of other feline leukemiaassociated disorders.\n\n\u2022 Weight loss despite a good to ravenous appetite. \u2022 Vomiting, diarrhea or voluminous feces.\n\nSee main reference on page 304 for details.\n\nWeight loss despite a good to ravenous appetite and hyperactivity are the most common signs.\n\nPolyuria/polydipsia, poor coat condition, vomiting, diarrhea or voluminous feces individually occur in 30-50% of cats.\n\nGastrointestinal signs associated with hyperthyroidism are often intermittent or relatively mild, with the exception of weight loss and appetite changes. About 90% of cats have increased appetite, but a small number are depressed and have a reduced appetite (apathetic hyperthyroidism). Some cats will have tachycardia, a gallop rhythm or other signs associated with congestive heart failure (coughing, increased respiratory rate, weakness) secondary to thyrotoxic heart disease.\n\nThe definitive diagnosis is an elevated serum total thyroxine concentration (total T 4 ). Other non-specific abnormalities of the hemogram or chemistry profile may include hemoconcentration, mild anemia, elevated serum alanine aminotransferase activity, or hyperglycemia.\n\nA thorough assessment of renal function should be undertaken (BUN, creatinine, urinalysis) before initiating treatment of hyperthyroidism because the increased renal blood flow associated with hyperthyroidism may result in acute renal decompensation when the thyroid disease is treated (especially with surgical or radioactive iodine therapy).\n\nCats with signs of hyperthyroidism but serum T 4 concentrations in the upper 1 \u2044 2 of the normal range should be tested using free (unbound) T 4 levels, as false lowering of the T 4 level may occur due to nonthyroidal illness.\n\nIn cats with suspected hyperthyroidism, but normal total or free T 4 levels, radioactive thyroid scan can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. See page 305.\n\nCats with tachycardia or an abnormal rhythm should also have thoracic radiographs and an echocardiogram performed to determine the extent of thyrotoxic heart disease and evaluate the need for therapy.\n\nThe major differentials for an older cat with weight loss, vomiting or diarrhea include neoplasia, hepatic or renal disease, inflammatory bowel disease and chronic pancreatitis. However, the presence of cardiovascular signs, a ravenous appetite or hyperactive behavior with the GI signs should point to hyperthyroidism first.\n\nTreatment for hyperthyroidism includes both control of the over-secretion of thyroid hormone as well as its effects on the remainder of the body (e.g. thyrotoxic heart disease).\n\nThere are three commonly used therapeutic approaches to treatment of the hyperthyroid condition in cats: (1) medical management with methimazole or carbimazole, (2) surgical removal of the adenomatous thyroid, and (3) \n\nMost adult cats infected with Giardia spp. remain asymptomatic.\n\nThe most common signs observed are the presence of liquid to semi-formed diarrhea, associated with increased frequency and quantity of defecation, in an otherwise healthy cat.\n\nMost cats remain bright, alert and afebrile.\n\nVomiting, dehydration, lethargy and anorexia may be observed in severe cases, but are uncommon.\n\nOccasionally, chronic small bowel diarrhea with weight loss and poor body condition are observed.\n\nCats are more likely to also have evidence of acute or chronic large bowel diarrhea (with hematochezia, increased mucus and tenesmus) than are other species affected.\n\nThe diagnosis is made by appropriate fecal examination techniques. Zinc sulfate flotation is considered to be the most accurate and practical test. Three consecutive zinc sulfate flotations will identify 95% of infected animals.\n\nOther methods include examination of fresh fecal saline smears for trophozoites (only 40% of infected animals will be identified), duodenal aspiration of fluid for examination for trophozoites (requires endoscopy or laparotomy, but is 88% effective), or fecal ELISA testing for Giardia-specific antigens (good sensitivity, but not specificity).\n\nFecal ELISA testing is highly sensitive (93% sensitivity) but has low specificity (60% specificity).\n\nMany other infectious, parasitic, dietary, toxic and idiopathic causes of small bowel diarrhea must be considered since many cats will have mild signs and be otherwise healthy.\n\nMetronidazole (25 mg/kg/q 12 h PO for 5 days) continues to be recommended for treatment of giardiasis in cats. However, resistant strains of the protozoan are increasingly being reported, and thus this therapy may not be effective in all cases.\n\nSide effects associated with metronidazole therapy include gastrointestinal upset and neurologic signs, such as seizures, coma and behavioral changes. All of these are less common in cats than in dogs and are reversible with discontinuation of treatment.\n\nOther drugs that have been recommended for treatment of giardiasis are quinacrine and furazolidine, but these drugs may not eliminate the infection, only improve the clinical signs.\n\nFenbendazole has been shown to be effective in treatment of giardiasis in cats and dogs. Another benzimadizole, albendazole, is not approved for use in cats in the United States and it may be teratogenic, hepatotoxic or cause bone marrow toxicity. Fenbendazole (50 mg/kg/day \u00d7 5 days) has been recommended for treatment of giardiasis in cats, and especially those with other concurrent parasitic infections.\n\nProper disposal of feces and good sanitation is essential to remove any environmental contamination.\n\n\u2022 Vomiting, anorexia and weight loss are the most common signs of upper GI IBD. \u2022 Diarrhea can occur, but is more prevalent with colonic disease. \u2022 Affected cats are usually middle-aged or older, with no particular sex or breed predisposition.\n\nSee main reference on page 768 for details.\n\nVomiting, which may be intermittent or severe, weight loss and anorexia are the most common signs.\n\nDiarrhea is also observed in some cats, but is more prevalent with disease affecting the distal small intestine or colon.\n\nMost cats with IBD have intermittent, chronic signs of GI disease, and with time, the signs progress to become more persistent and severe.\n\nThe disease is most prevalent in middle-aged to older cats, but the range is from 6 months to 17 years.\n\nThere appears to be no breed or sex predisposition to IBD in most studies, but purebred cats and males appear to be over-represented in some studies.\n\nIBD is a diagnosis of exclusion, that requires two steps: (1) the histopathologic confirmation of an excessive inflammatory response in the intestinal mucosa, and (2) the elimination of the multitude of potential causes for GI inflammation.\n\nThe majority of cats with IBD will have a normal hemogram and serum chemistry profile. However, abnormalities are not uncommon, but they are not specific for IBD. These include leukocytosis, mild nonregenerative anemia, increases in liver enzyme concentrations, mild hypoalbuminemia and mild hyperglycemia.\n\nFecal examination (flotation, direct exam, cytology) is essential to rule out parasitism, especially giardiasis.\n\nUltrasound examination is very important, not only in evaluation of the abdomen for structural abnormalities, but especially for assessing bowel wall thickness and lymph node enlargement, which have recently been shown to correlate well with the severity of IBD.\n\nUltrasound is also important, as it may allow fineneedle aspiration of abnormalities which facilitate diagnosis, but also will help determine the best approach to take when obtaining the biopsies (full thickness vs. endoscopic).\n\nRadiography, including contrast studies, has not been shown to be helpful in differentiating cats with IBD and those with other diseases.\n\nUltimately, endoscopic examination or a surgical exploratory will be necessary to obtain biopsies of the GI tract. Endoscopy is less invasive and allows visualization of the mucosal surface, which may help obtain more diagnostic biopsy samples. Multiple (6-8) biopsies should be taken from various sites including the stomach, duodenum, ileum and colon, even if there is no visible evidence of disease.\n\nSince there are no simple, easy tests for food intolerance or allergy, dietary elimination trials should be conducted in all cats with signs of IBD or that have inflammatory infiltrates of the GI tract.\n\nThe list of diseases that may mimic, cause or complicate IBD (e.g. cause GI inflammation and similar clinical signs) is extensive: \n\nThe first key to successful treatment of IBD is to have a correct diagnosis, and that is a real challenge.\n\nEven if food allergy/intolerance has been ruled out, a highly digestible, hypoallergenic or elimination diet is important in the treatment of IBD. Cats with IBD have an abnormal gut immune system, thus the presence of additional dietary antigens may serve to exacerbate the inflammatory response. A \"sacrificial\" protein source may have to be used first, while the bowel is still subject to a strong inflammatory response, before moving onto a more permanent food choice.\n\nThe mainstay of treatment of IBD in cats is immunosuppressive doses of prednisolone (2-4 mg/kg/day PO).\n\nMetronidazole (10-15 mg/kg q 12 h PO) is also very effective, and in some cats, may be as effective as steroid therapy. Many clinicians start with metronidazole and dietary therapy, and then add prednisolone if the response to treatment is incomplete.\n\nIn cats with severe IBD that is not responsive to metronidazole, prednisolone and dietary therapy, cytotoxic drugs may be considered. However, most cats with IBD do not require additional cytotoxic drug therapy to manage their disease, so a careful reevaluation of the patient is indicated to be sure you have the correct diagnosis. Drugs that may be considered include chlorambucil (2 mg/m 2 ), azathioprine (0.3 mg/kg EOD) and cyclosporine (5 mg/cat/day). Hemograms should be monitored every 2-3 weeks to detect myelosuppression, and if cyclosporine is used, cyclosporine therapy must be monitored by checking trough and peak drug levels.\n\nCats with a poor response to treatment or recurrent disease should be carefully re-evaluated, includingre-biopsy if indicated. Lymphoplasmacytic enteritis can be mistaken for lymphoma in the early stage.\n\nCats with IBD have been reported to have concurrent reactivation of toxoplasmosis. Food allergy/intolerance is extremely difficult to differentiate from IBD and in some cats finding the appropriate diet is a true challenge.\n\nClassical signs\n\n\u2022 With lymphoplasmacytic forms, chronic weight loss, anorexia, vomiting and icterus are common signs. \u2022 In neutrophilic cholangitis, the disease is more acute in nature, and fever, depression and icterus are typical.\n\nSee main reference on page 427 for details (The Yellow Cat or Cat With Elevated Liver Enzymes).\n\nWeight loss (often dramatic), anorexia, intermittent vomiting, and icterus are the most common signs in cats with lymphocytic cholangitis. These cats often are middle aged, there is no breed or sex predisposition, and they have hepatomegaly. Concurrent pancreatitis and/or IBD is seen in some cats and their illness is more chronic and subacute. In some cats, there is a waxing and waning course with periods of normalcy and a good appetite following episodes of signs.\n\nAscites (high protein content) is more likely with the lymphoplasmacytic form, but it is rare.\n\nCats with neutrophilic cholangitis are more often male, febrile, depressed, icteric and have an acute onset of illness that is rapidly progressive.\n\nThe diarrhea may be mild, with soft to unformed feces in cats with lymphocytic cholangitis, to severe, liquid diarrhea in cats with neutrophilic cholangitis.\n\nThe presence of icterus helps to narrow the differentials list to hepatic, pre-hepatic and post-hepatic diseases.\n\nThe hemogram in cats with hepatic disease is often abnormal (e.g. mild, non-regenerative anemia, with RBC morphology having schistocytes, leptocytes or target cells present), but the changes are not specific for liver disease. However, it does help rule out prehepatic causes of icterus.\n\nSerum chemistry abnormalities may include elevated liver enzyme activities (sometimes dramatically), hyperbilirubinemia, hypocholesterolemia, hypoalbuminemia, decreased BUN, and electrolyte alterations consistent with vomiting or dehydration, e.g. hypokalemia, hypernatremia.\n\nBilirubinemia and bilirubinuria are both common.\n\nSerum bile acid assay (pre-and 2 hours post-prandial) may show mild to moderate elevations.\n\nUrine sulfated bile acids is a new test of hepatic function that may also become useful in the diagnosis of liver disease.\n\nCoagulation function (platelet numbers and function, and coagulation factors) should be evaluated since liver disease often adversely affects these functions.\n\nUltrasonography is the most useful imaging modality, because it can also be used to obtain fine-needle aspirates or biopsies. However, needle biopsies are only accurate for diagnosis of cholangitis < 40% of the time. In cats with cholangitis, the liver may be normal, decreased or increased in size, but typically will have a hyperechoic pattern due to the presence of inflammatory infiltrates.\n\nLiver biopsies taken via surgical exploratory or laparoscopy are more accurate, and will also allow placement of a feeding tube (gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube) during the procedure, which is essential for any cat that has not eaten for 3-5 days.\n\nIn addition to liver histopathology, samples of hepatic tissue should also be submitted for aerobic and anaerobic culture.\n\nCats that have vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss in addition to icterus, the list of differentials is narrowed to pre-hepatic causes (hemolysis), hepatic causes (hepatic lipidosis, hepatic necrosis, hepatic failure, etc.), and post-hepatic causes (pancreatitis, neoplasia of stomach, pancreas, duodenum or bile duct, and common bile duct obstruction).\n\nIn cats that are not icteric, the list of potential causes broadens extensively to include the spectrum of metabolic, neoplastic, toxic and infectious causes of both systemic and primary gastrointestinal origin.\n\nTherapy for cats with cholangitis is largely supportive, but the histopathologic findings are crucial in determining severity, the type of inflammatory infiltrate (which is essential to choosing appropriate therapy), and the overall prognosis for the disease.\n\nMost cats with severe liver disease will require fluid therapy to replace deficits, provide maintenance fluid support during the recovery period, and induce diuresis to assist removal of hepatotoxins and prevent tubular sludging from bilirubinuria and casts.\n\nThe fluids should be isotonic, balanced electrolyte solutions, but preferably not containing lactate which is not converted to bicarbonate in cats with liver failure and thus serves as an additional source of acid (Ringers solution and Normosol-R are replacement electrolyte solutions without lactate).\n\nVomiting should be controlled with a combination of anti-emetic therapy (e.g. metoclopramide or dolasetron) and acid-blocking therapy (H 2 antagonists such as famotidine, ranitidine or cimetidine), since cats with liver disease are prone to the development of hypergastrinemic gastritis.\n\nDiarrhea is rarely severe enough to require therapy and often resolves as the anorexia worsens.\n\nCholerectic agents (ursodeoxycholic acid) should be used to reduce bile sludging and improve bile salt flow.\n\nCats with neutrophilic cholangitis should be given broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics. Penicillin or metronidazole, and fluorinated quinolones or aminoglycosides combined together provide a good spectrum of activity for enteric pathogens. Ideally, the antibiotic choice should be based upon culture results, but if the culture is negative or the cat is systemically ill, antimicrobial chemotherapy should be initiated and is continued for 3-6 months.\n\nLymphocytic cholangitis is believed to be an immune-mediated phenomenon and has recently been shown to occur in association with inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory renal disease and pancreatitis. Prednisolone therapy (2-4 mg/kg/day) is indicated in cats with lymphocytic plasmacytic hepatic infiltrates. The decision of when to decrease the dose to 1 mg/kg/day or eventually every other day depends entirely on the cat, its clinical response to treatment and clinicopathologic evidence of improvement.\n\nMetronidazole (10-15 mg/kg/day PO) for 2-4 weeks or indefinitely is also used, especially in cats with concurrent IBD.\n\nUrsodeoxycholic acid supplementation is also recommended (10-15 mg/kg/day PO) indefinitely for its choleretic activity.\n\nNutritional support must be provided, and in the short term (1-3 days) nasoesophageal feeding tubes work well, but for longer periods, esophageal feeding tubes or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube should be placed to allow larger amounts of food per feeding, as well as feeding a blenderized cat food rather than liquid enteral diets.\n\nMost anorectic or ill cats will benefit from addition of B vitamins to the fluids. However, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency may also develop in cats that are anorectic or have malabsorption. Supplementation with vitamin K (2.5-5 mg SC q 2 weeks) and in some cases, vitamin E should be considered in those cats.\n\nIn some cats with evidence of concurrent lipidosis, supplemental taurine (250-500 mg PO q 24 h) and carnitine (250 mg PO q 24 h) should be given.\n\nAnti-oxidant therapy with S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) 20 mg/kg/day PO should be instituted for hepato protection.\n\n\u2022 Typically, there is acute small bowel diarrhea with or without anorexia or lethargy. \u2022 Some cats develop chronic, intermittent diarrhea.\n\nWith Signs of Acute Small Bowel Diarrhea).\n\nThe most common clinical sign is severe, watery to mucohemorrhagic diarrhea.\n\nIn most cats, the diarrhea only lasts a few days, but in some, it may persist and become chronic. Animals that have severe diarrhea will become dehydrated, lethargic and may be anorexic.\n\nThere is no breed, sex or age predisposition, but cats from catteries or in stressed environments are at increased risk.\n\nThe history and physical examination findings help to focus the diagnostic approach toward infectious, parasitic and dietary causes of diarrhea.\n\nThe presence of the organism can be confirmed by culture of fresh fecal specimens. However, because this bacterium is part of the normal flora, this is not definitive.\n\nSimilar to the dog, the presence of spores in large numbers (> 5/hpf) on a stained fecal smear does not correlate with the presence of enterotoxin.\n\nReverse passive latex agglutination (RPLA) tests for clostridial enterotoxin are available and have been used in dogs and humans, but have not been evaluated in cats. In dogs, the test does not differentiate dogs with clostridial diarrhea from normal dogs. A positive enterotoxin assay determined by ELISA (Techlab, Inc., Blacksburg, VA) in the context of clinical signs consistent with clostridial infection is strongly supportive of clostridial-associated diarrhea in dogs. The clinical utility of this assay in cats has not been evaluated.\n\nPCR tests are also utilized for testing feces for enterotoxin, but are not universally available.\n\n\u2022 Variable and vague clinical signs including weight loss, fever and anorexia. \u2022 Vomiting or diarrhea are less common.\n\nThe clinical signs are quite variable and depend a great deal upon the stage when the cat presents for evaluation and whether they have enteric coronavirus infection or FIP.\n\nCats with fulminant FIP will likely be severely depressed, pyrectic, anorectic, and have significant weight loss. Respiratory distress from pleural effusion is also common, as is the presence of ascites.\n\nCats with so-called non-effusive, or \"dry\" FIP, will have more vague clinical signs, including reduced appetite, fever, mild weight loss and general malaise. Some cats will have mild abdominal discomfort, respiratory signs and granulomatous retinal lesions.\n\nIn some cats, FIP granulomas will cause more focal signs associated with the body system that is affected.\n\nVomiting and/or diarrhea are usually secondary to the systemic effects of infection or due to granuloma formation in the GI tract.\n\nCentral nervous system signs range from ataxia to seizures, and behavior changes, are common in cats with the non-effusive form of FIP.\n\nThe definitive diagnosis of FIP in cats is quite difficult, especially in cases of focal or non-fulminant FIP.\n\nSerologic tests are not useful, because most are not specific for FIP rather than coronavirus infection. The ELISA for the 7B protein of the FIP virus generates a relatively high number of false-negative and false-positive results. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is the best hope for a definitive test, but at present is only definitive for confirmation that a cat does not have FIP. The PCR test still has false positives that prevent it from being a good screening/diagnostic test.\n\nCurrently, the definitive test for FIP remains histopathologic examination and virus isolation.\n\n\u2022 Variable clinical signs which depend on the stage of the disease and its presentation (immunodeficiency disease, neoplasia, CNS disease, etc.). \u2022 Chronic diarrhea sometimes occurs.\n\nSee main reference on page 339 for details.\n\nThe most common signs in cats with FIV are immunodeficiency diseases such as chronic or recurrent infections, especially of the oral cavity (gingivitis/stomatitis), skin (dermatitis, neoplasia), ears (chronic otitis), urinary tract (cystitis) and GI tract.\n\nChronic enteritis or enterocolitis are associated with chronic diarrhea, weight loss, anorexia and lethargy.\n\nIn severe cases, the diarrhea is persistent and unresponsive to therapy.\n\nOther clinical signs are associated with development of CNS disease, neoplasia or secondary infections that result in systemic illness.\n\nFIV is most prevalent in middle-aged, male cats that live outdoors or are allowed to roam, and are prone to fighting.\n\nThe history and physical examination findings are often suggestive of chronic immunodeficiency disease.\n\nHemogram and serum chemistry abnormalities are not specific, but lymphopenia is a common finding.\n\nDiagnosis is made by determining the presence of FIV antibody on a commercially available ELISA test, as long as the cat has not been previously vaccinated with the FIV vaccine.\n\nA western blot analysis or PCR test can be used to confirm the presence of the virus.\n\nIn cases where FIV is confirmed, a further search for other infectious or parasitic causes (Cryptosporidia, Toxoplasma, Giardia, Campylobacter, Salmonella, etc.) should be pursued because concurrent infections with other agents are common with FIV.\n\n\u2022 Weight loss, anorexia and vague signs of malaise. \u2022 Vomiting is the more common than diarrhea. \u2022 Most common in older, Siamese cats.\n\nSee main reference on page 677 for details.\n\nThe most common clinical signs are anorexia, weight loss and vague signs of malaise.\n\nVomiting is more common than diarrhea because of the tendency of the tumor to produce an annular, obstructive lesion in the distal small intestine, however, diarrhea is not unusual. In general, the GI signs occur late in the course of the disease.\n\nAbdominal pain may also occur, especially in cats with metastatic disease.\n\nThe disease is most common in older, Siamese cats.\n\nA history of persistent lethargy, weight loss or anorexia in an older cat, especially a Siamese, should raise suspicions of chronic GI disease and the need for further evaluation.\n\nAbdominal palpation may reveal a thickened region of bowel or a firm mass.\n\nA routine hemogram and chemistry profile is often unremarkable or has non-specific abnormalities associated with chronic disease, such as mild nonregenerative anemia, hypoproteinemia, or elevated liver enzyme concentrations.\n\nImaging studies such as contrast radiography or ultrasound examinations are useful in identifying and localizing the lesion. Ultrasound can also be used to obtain a fine-needle aspirate of the mass or regional lymph nodes. A thoracic radiograph to check for metastasis is also indicated.\n\nUltimately, the definitive diagnosis is by histopathologic examination of the tissue obtained either by endoscopic or surgical biopsies.\n\nSurgical exploratory is often the best approach for both obtaining tissue for diagnosis, as well as allowing for surgical removal of the affected tissue. In addition, biopsies of regional lymph nodes can also be obtained.\n\n\u2022 Abdominal distention, colicky abdominal pain, and diarrhea are most common. \u2022 Kittens are generally in poor body condition, or have other concurrent infections.\n\nSee main reference on page 726 for details.\n\nCampylobacter was isolated from 21% of cats with diarrhea and 4% of healthy cats in one study. Other studies with and without diarrhea have reported isolation rates varying from 0-50%.\n\nIn cats, clinical signs of campylobacteriosis are uncommon, as most infections are asymptomatic in the absence of other pathogens. Concurrent infections with other intestinal pathogens, such as Giardia or Salmonella may exacerbate signs.\n\nAffected cats are usually less than 6 months of age.\n\nThe primary clinical sign of infection is diarrhea, which may be watery, bloody, mucoid or a combination.\n\nSome kittens will become systemically ill with lethargy, dehydration and anorexia observed.\n\nMost kittens will have acute diarrhea, but in some cats, chronic, recurrent bouts of diarrhea are observed.\n\nHistory and physical examination findings are important to rule out other causes, but may be unremarkable.\n\nDiagnosis can be confirmed by culturing freshly obtained fecal samples. Samples can be transported at room temperature without special handling, but must be cultured in a microaerophilic atmosphere.\n\nA specific request for culture of Campylobacter should be submitted if it is suspected.\n\nDark-field or phase contrast microscopy can also be used to identify the motile, curved bacteria on fresh fecal samples. Gram-stained samples can also be used to identify the gull wing-shaped rods in the feces. However, these approaches are less sensitive and require more technical skill.\n\nInfectious (Salmonella, Clostridium), parasitic (Giardia, Cryptosporidia, etc.) , and dietary (food intolerance or dietary indiscretion) agents should all be considered.\n\nSince most cats with Campylobacter infections are asymptomatic, or it is associated with other infections, the effectiveness of antibiotics for treatment of this disease is unknown.\n\nSeveral antibiotics appear to be effective in eliminating the organism, including erythromycin (10 mg/kg q 8 h PO), metronidazole (5-10 mg/kg q 12 h PO), cephalosporins (20 mg/kg q 12 h PO), and fluorinated quinolones (5 mg/kg q 12 h PO).\n\n\u2022 Weight loss despite a vigorous appetite, which may include pica and coprophagy. \u2022 Fecal characteristics may be normal, soft and voluminous or watery diarrhea. \u2022 Poor haircoat and greasy, flakey seborrhea are also common. \u2022 Very rare in cats.\n\nThe most common cause of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) in the cat is chronic pancreatitis.\n\nA less common cause of EPI is infestation with the feline pancreatic fluke, Eurytrema procyonis.\n\nOther, possible causes of EPI in cats include pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and congenital pancreatic acinar hypoplasia or aplasia.\n\nIdiopathic pancreatic acinar atrophy, the most common cause of EPI in dogs, has not been reported in cats.\n\nIn humans with EPI caused by chronic pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus occurs concurrently. It is unknown whether cats with chronic pancreatitis and EPI will also progress to develop diabetes mellitus as well, however, diabetes mellitus has been reported in a cat with EPI.\n\nEPI is believed to develop when > 90% of the enzymes of the exocrine pancreas are destroyed. These enzymes play an integral role in assimilating the major food components: proteins, lipids and carbohydrates.\n\nPancreatic enzymes increase the efficiency of breakdown of macromolecules in the digestive tract and enhance the transport mechanisms for sugars, amino acids and fatty acids. Thus, without pancreatic enzymes, food substances are inefficiently broken down and cannot be readily transported across the intestinal lumen.\n\nDiarrhea occurs due to the presence of large quantities of fats, protein and carbohydrates, which are osmotically active.\n\nMaldigestion of these important nutrients leads to weight loss and may also cause deficiencies of vitamins, fatty acids or other essential nutrients.\n\nThis is a rare disease in cats.\n\nThe most common clinical signs are polyphagia, diarrhea and weight loss.\n\nVomiting and anorexia are also occasionally reported.\n\nThe feces are typically pale, loose, voluminous, and they may be quite malodorous.\n\nCats often have a greasy, flaky haircoat due to the fat malabsorption.\n\n, which may present as excessive bleeding from venipuncture sites or spontaneous hemorrhage (nose bleeds, hematuria, melena, etc.).\n\nResults from routine hematology and chemistry profiles will be normal in most cats. Occasionally, elevations in hepatic enzymes or neutrophilia will be observed.\n\nRoutine abdominal radiography and ultrasonography is usually normal, and is not diagnostic.\n\nFecal proteolytic activity testing will reveal undetectable levels of enzymes, which is diagnostic for EPI, but the test is very labile, so false-positive results may occur due to improper sample handling.\n\nA recently validated radioimmunoassay for feline trypsin-like immunoreactivity (fTLI) is available, much like the TLI test available for use in dogs.\n\nAll cats with EPI should have a serum cobalamin and folate assay, since many cats with EPI are cobalamin deficient or have concurrent small bowel disease (folate levels will be low).\n\nThe clinical signs are so non-specific that many other diseases that cause polyphagia, weight loss and diarrhea must be considered. Hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid treatment or hyperadrenocorticism, chronic renal failure, heart failure, liver disease, dental disease, neoplasia, and chronic intestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease are the main differentials.\n\nMost cats with EPI can be successfully treated by dietary supplementation with pancreatic enzymes. The powder products (1 tsp per meal) appear to be more clinically effective than tablets.\n\nIf the cat refuses to eat the food with pancreatic extract, raw pancreas can be offered, but it is essential to use bovine pancreas to prevent transmission of Aujeszky's disease in porcine pancreas.\n\nA diet that contains low amounts of insoluble fiber should be fed, since insoluble fibers may interfere with pancreatic enzyme activity. Some cats will not respond to enzyme supplementation alone, and this may be due to concurrent cobalamin deficiency or small intestinal disease. Cobalamin supplementation should be given parenterally (100-250 \u03bcg SC once weekly for 6-8 weeks, then monthly or bimonthly as needed).\n\nIn cats with suspected vitamin K deficiency, supplementation should also be initiated (vitamin K 1 1 mg/kg/day PO).\n\nIt is unknown whether or not cats develop small intestinal bacterial overgrowth as a complication of EPI (as is common in dogs). However, in cats that do not respond as anticipated to pancreatic enzyme supplementation, addition of metronidazole or tetracycline to the treatment regime is indicated.\n\nBecause EPI is associated with the irreversible loss of pancreatic acinar tissue, complete recovery is not possible.\n\nHowever, with appropriate management, cats with EPI will gain weight, pass normal feces and can live a normal life.\n\nThere is no known way to prevent the development of EPI, however, if cats with chronic pancreatitis can be recognized and appropriately managed, it may be possible to prevent the consequences of chronic pancreatitis and the development of EPI.\n\n\u2022 The only presenting sign is chronic diarrhea.\n\nUnknown pathogenesis.\n\nDisorder occurs in kittens and young cats under a year of age.\n\nThe only clinical sign is presence of chronic small bowel diarrhea.\n\nKittens are otherwise healthy, active and gain weight.\n\nThe diagnosis is one of exclusion. Thus, infectious, parasitic, dietary and mechanical disorders must all be ruled out.\n\nCats with this syndrome are often purebred cats, and the diarrhea is self-limiting once they reach adult age.\n\nBecause this is a disease of kittens, bacterial, viral, parasitic, protozoal, dietary and toxic causes of diarrhea must all be carefully considered.\n\nThere is no known effective treatment for this condition, but it appears to be self-limiting as the kitten reaches adult age. The reason for this is unknown, but may be due to development of an adult, fully competent immune system.\n\nGood once the kitten reaches adult age.\n\n\u2022 Weight loss, decreased appetite or anorexia and chronic diarrhea.\n\nSee main reference on page 687 for details.\n\nSystemic mast cell tumors produce GI tract signs through release of histamine and other vasoactive substances, which result in gastroduodenal ulceration.\n\nIntestinal mast cell tumors are typically poorly differentiated, highly malignant tumors that appear to consist of degranulated (e.g. non-functional) neoplastic mast cells. However, they produce GI tract signs through local effects (e.g. obstruction) or surface ulceration (bleeding) rather than through the release of vasoactive substances, as is the case with systemic mast cell tumors.\n\nThe most common clinical signs are weight loss, anorexia or decreased appetite, and chronic diarrhea. Other signs include lethargy, vomiting or acute abdominal pain.\n\nMelena or chronic asymptomatic blood loss may result in anemia, and sometimes is severe enough to cause weakness or lethargy.\n\nIn some cats, a palpable thickened intestinal segment or a mass will be present.\n\nIntestinal mast cell tumors are very small, difficult to palpate until late, and tend to be solitary. They occur as an infiltrating mass, but metastasize early in the course of the disease.\n\nA chronic history of weight loss or anorexia in a middle-aged or older cat should raise the suspicion of intestinal neoplasia.\n\nRoutine hemogram and serum chemistry profiles will often be normal, but non-specific abnormalities such as mild non-regenerative anemia, hypoproteinemia or hypoalbuminemia, and electrolyte disturbances associated with chronic vomiting or diarrhea can be seen.\n\nOther tests of GI function (e.g. fTLI, fecal alpha-1 protease inhibitor, cobalamin/folate assays, fecal analyses for parasites) should be considered or performed, but will not be diagnostic.\n\nImaging studies, especially ultrasound examination, will be the most helpful in localizing the lesion (which can be easily missed because they are often extremely small or focal). Fine-needle aspirates of focal masses can be obtained which will often help direct further diagnostic and treatment plans.\n\nEndoscopy may be helpful, but in many cases, these tumors are present in the jejunum, and are unreachable by the endoscope.\n\nIf imaging studies are unavailable, or fine-needle aspirates are non-diagnostic, an exploratory laparotomy is indicated.\n\nThe primary differentials for cats with chronic weight loss, anorexia and chronic diarrhea are IBD, neoplasia, lymphangiectasia, and systemic organ failure or dysfunction (renal disease, liver failure, etc.).\n\nTreatment is palliative and supportive for cats with intestinal mast cell tumors.\n\nSurgical removal of the affected segment of bowel with wide surgical margins is the only therapy reported to be effective in prolonging survival. Mesenteric, hepatic and splenic metastasis are commonly observed by the time the tumor is diagnosed.\n\nChemotherapy has not been shown to increase survival time in cats with this disease, although prednisolone (2-4 mg/kg/day) and histamine 2 blockers (cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine) are advocated to reduce secondary clinical signs associated with mast cell disease.\n\nNutritional support may be required in cats that refuse to eat, as they will develop hepatic lipidosis and protein calorie malnutrition.\n\nThe prognosis is poor, as the average survival time following diagnosis with this tumor is 4 months.\n\n\u2022 Typically, lethargy, weakness and vomiting.\n\n\u2022 Regurgitation (megaesophagus), diarrhea and abdominal pain may occur.\n\nSee main reference on page 752 for details.\n\nLethargy, weakness and vomiting are the classic presenting signs, but diarrhea and abdominal pain may also be observed.\n\nMegaesophagus, with resultant regurgitation, may occur due to muscle weakness, but it is very uncommon in cats.\n\nHypoadrenal crisis is associated with an acute episode of collapse due to severe alterations in sodium and potassium that result in severe muscle weakness and cardiovascular collapse. This is a rare occurrence in cats compared to dogs, but requires rapid recognition and response to stabilize the patient.\n\nThe history and clinical signs are often too nonspecific to be helpful, but are still important in development of a diagnostic approach.\n\nThe classic hemogram and biochemical changes include eosinophilia, lymphopenia, azotemia, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia and low or isosthenuric urine specific gravity.\n\nHowever, some cats will not have mineralocorticoid deficiency, thus, no electrolyte changes will be evident on the chemistry profile.\n\nCats with severe hyperkalemia (> 7 mEq/L) will have characteristic ECG abnormalities and bradycardia.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis is by performing an ACTH stimulation test. Cortisol levels will be low and will not respond to ACTH administration.\n\nBecause the clinical signs and routine blood work are non-specific, a wide variety of metabolic, neoplastic, infectious and idiopathic conditions must be considered. In many cats, the ACTH stimulation test is performed based on clinical suspicion, not clear physical or biochemical findings that suggest hypoadrenocorticism.\n\nIn cats that are clinically dehydrated, have pre-renal azotemia or in an acute adrenal crisis, fluid therapy with isotonic saline is the initial treatment of choice. If there are cardiac arrhythmias or ECG abnormalities associated with severe hyperkalemia, regular insulin (0.2-0.5 U/kg IV) and dextrose therapy (0.5-1.0 g/kg IV slowly), intravenous bicarbonate (body weight (kg) \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 base deficit, or 0.5-1.0 mEq/kg over 6 h), or intravenous calcium gluconate therapy (0.5-1.0 ml/kg, IV slowly) may be administered to rapidly lower extracellular potassium levels.\n\nParenteral corticosteroids (dexamethasone, methyl prednisolone, which have some mineralocorticoid effects as well) should be administered in physiologic doses (0.2-0.4 mg/kg) initially, and continued daily (oral or injectable) as replacement therapy until the cat is stable.\n\nOnce the cat is in stable condition, replacement of mineralocorticoid hormones can be achieved orally (fluorinef) or with repository forms of the hormone, such as desoxycorticosterone pivalate (DOCP).\n\nTherapy for cats with this disease will be lifelong, and frequent rechecks to allow dose adjustments will be required. Most cats will have a good quality of life with proper management of this disease.\n\n\u2022 Signs may indicate respiratory, eye, CNS, bone marrow or GI tract involvement. \u2022 Typically, respiratory signs such as wheezing, coughing or dyspnea predominate. \u2022 GI signs are usually associated with protracted, watery diarrhea, that may contain blood or mucus.\n\nHistoplasma capsulatum is a soil-borne fungus, which is found in many temperate and subtropical areas of the world, especially where it is moist and humid. The organism grows particularly well if there is bird or bat excrement in the soil.\n\nIn the States, it is most frequent in Southern and Central USA around the Ohio, Missouri and Mississippi Rivers.\n\nThe majority of infections are subclinical or cause only mild, transient clinical signs.\n\nCats are equally susceptible as dogs, and the majority of symptomatic cats are young (< 4 years of age).\n\nInfection is contracted via inhalation, although the GIT may also be a route of infection. Signs occur approximately 12-16 days after exposure.\n\nInitial infection is confined to the respiratory tract, but dissemination often occurs resulting in chronic disease over months or years with signs referable to spleen (splenomegaly), liver (hepatomegaly, icterus, ascites), GIT (chronic diarrhea and weight loss), peritoneum (omental or mesenteric masses); lymph nodes (peripheral or abdominal lymphadenopathy), bone marrow (anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia), bones (lameness and proliferative or lytic boney lesions), eyes (conjunctivitis, exudative anterior uveitis, multifocal granulomatous chorioretinitis, optic neuritis), central nervous system (ataxia, seizures, circling, disorientation, anisocoria, paresis, decreased conscious proprioception), and occasionally skin (nodular or ulcerated lesions).\n\nThe most common clinical signs of histoplasmosis in cats are multisystemic, including depression, weight loss, anorexia, dyspnea or lameness.\n\nOther signs may include fever, pale mucous membranes, peripheral lymphadenopathy, icterus, hepatomegaly, skin nodules or splenomegaly.\n\nThe organism can be most commonly found in the respiratory tract, bone, bone marrow, skin and GI tract.\n\nGI signs are not common in cats (as they are in dogs), but when they occur chronic diarrhea, mesenteric lymphadenopathy and anorexia are common.\n\nOcular changes may include conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, retinal detachment or chorioretinitis.\n\nThe clinical signs of disseminated histoplasmosis are consistent with systemic illness and are associated with a wide variety of non-specific clinical and laboratory changes.\n\nAnemia of chronic disease is the most common hematologic abnormality.\n\nThrombocytopenia is also a common abnormality.\n\nas the sensitivity and specificity for the organism is poor.\n\nThe best method of diagnosis is to identify the organism in cytologic or histopathologic examinations. The best tissues for diagnosis of histoplasmosis in the cat are bone marrow, lymph nodes, lung, liver or skin nodules if present.\n\nThere are a wide variety of potential differentials due to the different clinical presentation that may occur depending on the organ system affected.\n\nItraconazole (10 mg/kg PO q 24 h) is the drug of choice for initial therapy. It is highly effective and has minimal toxicity, but is relatively expensive and treatment must be continued for 1 month (at least) beyond the resolution of clinical signs and evidence of disease (typically 6-9 months).\n\nOther treatment options include fluconazole, ketoconazole and amphotericin B.\n\nThe success rate with itraconazole therapy is reported to be anywhere from 33% to >90%, but this depends in large measure on the severity of the infection at the time of diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 Abdominal pain, anorexia and vomiting.\n\n\u2022 Diarrhea, weight loss, and lethargy occur in long-standing cases. \u2022 Intussusceptions are usually seen in young cats or kittens.\n\nSee main reference on page 643 for details.\n\nWith high intussusceptions, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, lethargy, dehydration and hypovolemia leading to shock are the most common clinical signs.\n\nLow intussusceptions (at the iliocolic junction) typically present with bloody, mucoid diarrhea, tenesmus, intermittent vomiting and weight loss. In many of these cases, the intussusception can be palpated.\n\nMost intussusceptions are associated with acute disease, but sliding intussusceptions may result in chronic, intermittent signs.\n\nA palpable mass in the abdomen may be evident, especially with low intussusceptions.\n\nHemogram and serum biochemistry profiles will be variable depending on the severity and location of the intussusception, however, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, anemia and leukocyte changes have all been observed depending on the site, severity and precipitating cause of the intussusception.\n\nRadiographs and/or ultrasound examination of the gastrointestinal tract are the best means of confirming the diagnosis. Radiographs may not be definitive, but in most cases, an obstructive pattern (dilated loops of bowel, different bowel loop sizes) will be apparent. However, an ultrasound of the abdomen will often definitively identify the intussusception. Contrast studies may be used but should not be done at the expense of delaying treatment in severely ill cases. In the case of sliding intussusceptions, the diagnostic procedures should be performed when the clinical signs are most prominent.\n\nEndoscopic examination or colonoscopy can also be used to obtain a diagnosis, especially with low intussusceptions.\n\nExploratory laparotomy may be required to obtain a definitive diagnosis, and is essential for treatment, so in cats with evidence of intestinal obstruction, or in cats with acute abdomen and shock, surgery should be performed early.\n\nMany diseases that can precipitate an intussusception (e.g. viral enteritis, foreign bodies, gastroenteritis, intestinal parasitism, etc.) also have clinical signs that mimic it. Thus, a thorough physical examination, diagnostic evaluation, and close patient monitoring are essential. Mesenteric volvulus is a very difficult condition to differentiate from intussusception, both clinically and radiographically.\n\nIntussusception must be considered a surgical emergency. Cats with signs of shock or endotoxemia should be prepared for surgery by correcting fluid and electrolyte imbalances, administration of broad-spectrum, parenteral antibiotics (combinations such as ampicillin or cefazolin and enrofloxain, amikacin, cefoxitin or imipenam), and use of histamine-2 blockers (ranitidine or famotidine) or protectants if gastric erosions or ulceration is suspected. \n\nThe clinical signs observed will depend upon the tumor location in the GI tract.\n\nIn cats, anorexia, weight loss and lethargy are the most common clinical signs of any gastrointestinal neoplastic disease.\n\nVomiting and/or diarrhea may be observed, but will be variable depending on whether the tumor is in the small intestine or colon, and whether it is diffuse or solitary in extent.\n\nPalpation of an intestinal mass is an important diagnostic tool, since many of these tumors are solitary and produce strictures or obstructions.\n\nHematology and serum biochemistry profiles may be within normal limits in cats with intestinal neoplasia.\n\nAbnormalities associated with secondary effects of the tumor include dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, anemia of chronic disease, etc.\n\nRadiographs of both the thorax and abdomen are an important, but sometimes non-diagnostic, tool.\n\nRadiographs are best for assessment of pulmonary metastasis.\n\nUltrasound is an invaluable tool for lesion localization, determination of lesion extent and in some cases, obtaining a fine-needle aspirate or biopsy of the lesion.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis is by histopathologic evaluation of a biopsy or tissue obtained after surgical resection.\n\n\u2022 Severe and in some cases intractable small bowel diarrhea.\n\nAmine precursor uptake and decarboxylation (APUD) cells are a diffuse system of endocrine cells in the body (primarily associated with the GI tract and other endocrine organs) that are able to secrete biogenic amines from amino acid precursors.\n\nAPUD cells are responsible for the potent secretory functions that APUD tumors display (e.g. insulinomas, gastrinomas, pheochromocytomas and carcinoid tumors of the gut).\n\nThe clinical signs are dependent on the tumor and effects, for example carcinoid tumors of the GI tract may produce secretory diarrhea in affected cats because of the vasoactive amines they produce.\n\nThese are rare tumors, and most tumors reported to date have been clinically silent.\n\nGastrinomas are also rare neoplasms that secrete gastrin, causing excessive secretion of hydrochloric acid by the stomach and resulting in gastric and duodenal ulcer disease.\n\nThese are rare neoplasms that are extremely difficult to diagnose (because they are very difficult to find).\n\nSome of these tumors (insulinoma, gastrinoma) can be presumptively diagnosed by measuring the level of the hormone they produce, but most APUDomas do not secrete hormones that are routinely measured.\n\nBecause these tumors are so rare, all other causes of chronic diarrhea should be considered before pursuing the APUD tumors as the cause of diarrhea.\n\nThe treatment of choice is to find and surgically excise the tumor. However, because the tumors are often microscopic or extremely small, they are often overlooked during an exploratory. In addition, by the time the tumor is large enough to find, it has often already metastasized.\n\nSupportive care and symptomatic therapy are often the only avenue. For example, in cats with gastrinomas, histamine 2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors are used to help control the excessive secretion of acid.\n\nGuarded to poor. These tumors are usually malignant, surgical excision is rarely curative and metastatic tumors are poorly responsive to chemotherapy.\n\n\u2022 Severe and in some cases intractable small bowel diarrhea. \u2022 Peripheral eosinophilia and infiltration of the bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes and other organs with eosinophils.\n\nHypereosinophilic syndrome is a relatively common variant of eosinophilic enteritis in the cat, but is distinct from eosinophilic leukemia.\n\nThe disease is characterized by infiltration of eosinophils in bowel, lymph nodes, spleen, liver and other organs, and peripheral eosinophilia, which separates this disease from eosinophilic IBD.\n\nThe etiopathogenesis of this disorder is unknown, but may be due to extensive antigenic dissemination or aberrant regulation of the normal eosinophilic response.\n\nThe disease is most common in middle-aged to older cats, and there is no breed or sex predisposition.\n\nThe clinical signs are similar to those of cats with IBD except the intestinal wall thickening is more pronounced, hepatosplenomegaly is common, and bloody diarrhea is common.\n\nSome cats will cough, have skin lesions (miliary dermatitis) and have peripheral lymphadenopathy, but these clinical signs are less common.\n\nThe diagnosis is made by histopathologic examination of liver, spleen, lymph node or intestinal biopsies which will reveal infiltration of large numbers of normal eosinophils.\n\nThe primary differentials are eosinophilic IBD and eosinophilic leukemia. Eosinophilic leukemia is differentiated from hypereosinophilic syndrome by its localization of eosinophils to the peripheral circulation and bone marrow. In eosinophilic IBD, eosinophils are found only in the lamina propria of the intestine and do not infiltrate other abdominal organs and lymph nodes.\n\nHigh-dose prednisolone therapy (3-6 mg/kg/day PO) is most commonly used, but relapses are common, even if the high doses of steroids are maintained.\n\nAn alternative therapy is with hydroxyurea (7.5 mg/kg q 12 h PO) for 3-14-day courses, as required to maintain the cat in remission.\n\nCats with hypereosinophilic syndrome often have severe diarrhea, and may require nutritional or fluid support until the disease is brought under control.\n\nThe prognosis is guarded to poor.\n\n\u2022 Moderate to severe, small or large bowel diarrhea, and weight loss, depending on the location and number of diverticuli.\n\nDiverticuli may be congenital or occur secondary to intussusception or other intestinal obstructive processes.\n\nMost clinical disease is associated with the diverticulitis and infection occurring at the site.\n\nMany intestinal diverticuli are clinically silent and are only found incidentally.\n\nDiverticulitis may result in the development of diarrhea, abdominal pain, lethargy or anorexia.\n\nThe definitive diagnosis is made by imaging studies (ultrasound, contrast rads) or by visualization (endoscopy or exploratory surgery).\n\nThe rarity of this problem should suggest that all other possible causes of diarrhea and lethargy are ruled out before consideration of this condition.\n\nSurgical resection of the affected bowel segment in clinically affected patients. Cats with diverticuli but without signs of disease do not require surgery.\n\n\u2022 Weight loss, poor hair coat, inappetance, and chronic (may be intermittent) diarrhea.\n\nPrimary lymphangiectasia is rare as a cause of protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) in cats. Most cats have PLE secondary to IBD or lymphosarcoma.\n\nPLE in cats may be associated with other severe malabsorptive or infiltrative diseases (e.g. histoplasmosis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency), but these are rare causes of protein loss in cats.\n\nThe clinical signs are dependent on the primary cause of the PLE. Cat may have anorexia and weight loss only, or have chronic unrelenting diarrhea, along with inappetance.\n\nMost cats are middle-aged to older, typical of the age range for IBD or lymphoma. PLE is simply another complication of the primary process and is not a diagnostic entity in cats.\n\nCats with PLE will have decreased serum total protein and albumin levels, in addition to other abnormalities consistent with their primary disease.\n\nUrinary protein loss, third space loss, lack of adequate intake and severe hepatic disease must all be ruled out before considering a diagnosis of PLE. Fecal alpha-1 protease inhibitor levels, a test for abnormal GI protein loss available for dogs, have not yet been validated for use in cats.\n\nAs for many other GI conditions, the definitive diagnosis of the inciting cause of PLE is obtained by biopsy.\n\nSince PLE is not a definitive diagnosis, a search for the primary cause is essential. Cats rarely develop lymphangiectasia or idiopathic PLE as is reported in dogs.\n\nOther causes for low albumin and serum protein levels must be considered when this abnormality is discovered, e.g. renal protein loss, severe hepatic disease, third space loss, and severe protein calorie malnutrition.\n\nTreatment of PLE is directed solely at correction of the primary disease process. Specific therapy for lymphoma or IBD will correct or at least control the cause of the protein loss.\n\nSymptomatic therapy for severe intestinal protein loss includes a highly digestible diet. Alternative sources of protein for inclusion in the diet are hydrolyzed protein diets (Hill's z/d) and elemental diets (e.g. Vivonex).\n\nMedium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil is not recommended for use in cats, as it is in dogs, because of the increased risk of hepatic lipidosis.\n\nGuarded, as most cats with PLE have a disease that is difficult if not impossible to cure.\n\n\u2022 Severe and in some cases intractable small bowel diarrhea.\n\nShort bowel syndrome is classically due to surgical resection of a large segment of the small intestine that results in fluid overload to the colon and resultant diarrhea.\n\nIntestinal adaptation occurs in the large bowel, which ultimately results in a return to a soft or semiformed fecal specimen, usually within 2-6 weeks.\n\nIf greater than 85% of the small intestine has been removed the chance for adaptation is poor.\n\nDiarrhea, dehydration and weight loss all occur as a result of short bowel syndrome.\n\nOther signs are related to intestinal malabsorption, such as deficiencies of essential amino acids, vitamins or clotting factors.\n\nSmall intestinal bacterial overgrowth may also occur, resulting in vomiting or anorexia as well.\n\nThe diagnosis is presumptive if surgical resection is the cause.\n\nCats are often hypoproteinemic, may be hypocholesterolemic, and have other non-specific hemogram or chemistry abnormalities.\n\nImaging studies can be used to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nOther diseases that may cause similar signs include severe intestinal strangulation, intussusception and intestinal volvulus, which is rare in cats.\n\nTincture of time will allow the bowel to adapt.\n\nBroad-spectrum antibiotics may be needed.\n\nLow-fat, highly digestible diets are necessary to maximize absorption of nutrients.\n\nAdministration of vitamins and minerals is usually needed. Monitoring prothrombin time and serum cobalamin levels will help determine whether supplementation is needed. (Vitamin K 1 5 mg/kg once, then 2.5 mg/kg q 12-24 h, cobalamin or multi-B complex injection weekly).\n\nParenteral nutrition may be required in some cats in the early stages to support them until bowel function returns.\n\nThe prognosis is guarded in cats in which diarrhea persists for longer than 2 months after the resection, as by that time, the chances of a return to normal function are poor.\n\n33 -THE CAT WITH SIGNS OF CHRONIC SMALL BOWEL DIARRHEA 761"}
