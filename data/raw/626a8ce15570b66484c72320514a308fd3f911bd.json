{"title": "Prospects for the use of spherical gold nanoparticles in immunization", "body": "Swine transmissible gastroenteritis is an acute, rapidly spreading, highly contagious enteric disease of pigs of all ages. It is characterized by vomiting, watery and yellow diarrhea, weight loss, and rapid dehydration, leading to a high mortality rate, especially in piglets (mortality decreases with age).\n\nSwine transmissible gastroenteritis is caused by transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of the genus Coronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. The major route of virus transmission is fecal-oral. Infected animals cannot digest food properly and die from dehydration.\n\nThe disease causes great economic losses in pig farms all over the world, and the primary means of animal protection against it is vaccination (Cheng and Niu 1992; Straw et al. 2000) . Therefore, the development of new vaccines and the implementation of large-scale vaccination programs are important in pig breeding (Moxley and Olson (1989) .\n\nIn several countries, vaccination against swine transmissible gastroenteritis is conducted effectively but only with inactivated monovalent and combined vaccines not recognized internationally. Traditional inactivated vaccines have high contents of contaminant substances (up to 99%), causing side effects, and/or may contain, as inactivating compounds, toxic agents such as phenol and formaldehyde, normally used to inactivate microbial cells. Moreover, traditional vaccines are usually low immunogenic, because killed microorganisms cannot induce fully functioning cellular immunity. Therefore, there is a need to develop new, more effective, and less costly vaccines against swine transmissible gastroenteritis (Mout et al. 2012) .\n\nRecent years have seen extremely fast development of new viral nanovaccines and diagnostic agents using nanostructures prepared by biological and chemical synthesis. In particular, this can be attributed to the development of biocompatible inorganic nanomaterials-gold nanoparticles. Gold nanoparticles are stable metallic nanoparticles which have excellent surface functional chemistry, high biocompatibility, and nil toxicity. In addition, gold nanoparticles can be easily synthesized, giving them shapes such as spheres, rods, cubes, stars, and pyramids. Several reports have described the development and use of nanostructures for the delivery of biologically active agents to target cells (Mout et al. 2012; Bhattacharya and Mukherjee 2008; Staroverov et al. 2012 ). To reach their target cells in vivo, nanoparticles must bypass many barriers that protect animals against antigens (Dreaden et al. 2012) .\n\nGold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been used widely as carriers of antigens and therapeutic agents in human medicine, veterinary practice, and biology . Of particular interest is the ability of GNPs to induce humoral immune response to weakly immunogenic antigens and haptens (Dykman et al. 2010a; Dykman et al. 2010b ). M o r e o v er, G N P s c on j u ga t ed t o T G E V h a v e a n immunostimulatory effect (Dykman et al. 2010b) .\n\nWe studied the immunological variable and morphological changes in the immune organs of guinea pigs immunized with TGEV antigen conjugated to GNPs as a nanocarrier.\n\nAntigen TGEV strain VN-96 was taken from the Museum of Strains of the Laboratory of Virology (Scientific Research Veterinary Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Saratov) and deposited in the All-Russian State Collection of Microbial Strains Used in Veterinary and Animal Husbandry by the number BVN-96^(patent RU2009124039A 2009). TGEV strain VN-96 with a titer of 6.5-7.5 lg TCD 50 ml \u22121 was used. Test cultures were inoculated with the same strain at 4.0 lg TCD 50 ml \u22121 after 72 h of cultivation. TGEV was purified in a sucrose gradient according to Horzinek et al. (1982) . The resultant virus suspension was used for protein analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) at a constant voltage of 80 V for 20 min and then at 200 V for 3 h (Maniatis et al. 1982) . For molecular m a s s d e t e r m i n a t i o n s , P r e c i s i o n P l u s P r o t e i n \u2122 Kaleidoscope\u2122 prestained protein standards no. 1610375 were used. The results of protein separation were processed with the Gel-Imager and Gel Explorer, version 1.0, programs (DNA-technology, Moscow). Genome identity was checked by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a specific primera conservative part of TGEV's S genome, containing 886 base pairs (bp) (Herrington and McGee 1993) . RNA was isolated from TGEV by using a NucleoS+TM suspension silicate sorbent (Biokom, Moscow) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR results were recorded on a transilluminator with a DNA-analyzer video system. PCR products obtained from a preparation of the TGEV strain VN-96 were analyzed by electrophoresis in agarose gel (1.5%) using DNA Ladder 100 as a molecular size marker and DNA of bacteriophage \u03bb as a negative control.\n\nAs viral nucleic acid is responsible for virulence, it was inactivated, after being isolated from TGEV and purified, with ribonuclease (RNAase), a hydrolase enzyme that catalyzes RNA hydrolysis. The inactivation was done by the procedure described by Fedorova et al. (2011) . The antigen resulting from nucleic acid inactivation was used for animal immunization.\n\nSpherical gold nanospheres (average diameter, 15 nm) were made by the citrate method of Frens (1973) . For reduction, 242.5 ml of 0.001% aqueous tetrachloroauric acid (HAuCl4; Sigma-Aldrich) was heated under reflux to 100\u00b0C on a magnetic stirrer in an Erlenmeyer flask. This was followed by the addition of 7.75 ml of 1% aqueous sodium citrate to the flask.\n\nThe particle diameter was found as described earlier (Khlebtsov and Dykman 2010) , by using a Libra 120 transmission electron microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany), a Specord S 250 spectrophotometer (Analytik Jena, Germany), and a Zetasizer Nano-ZS particle size and zeta potential analyzer (Malvern).\n\nTo prepare antigen-gold nanoparticle conjugates, we found the Bgold number^(minimal amount of antigen that protects the sol against salt aggregation) for the antigen solution. To this end, 20 \u03bcl of an antigen solution in PBS (initial concentration, 1 mg ml \u22121 ) was titrated twofold on a 96-well microtiter plate. Each well received 200 \u03bcl of GNPs and 20 \u03bcl of 1.7 M NaCl. The minimal stabilizing concentration for the antigen was 12.5 \u03bcg ml \u22121 . Conjugation was done by simple mixing (without the use of coupling agents) (Dykman et al. 2008 ).\n\nThirty six male guinea pigs, weighing 300-350 g at the time the experiment started, were used. The animals were cared for and handled in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes, and the legislation of the Russian Federation.\n\nFor immunobiological studies, the guinea pigs were divided into four groups of nine each. The animals were immunized subcutaneously along the spinal column by two injections with an interval of 10 days between. The guinea pigs in group 1 were injected with 1.0 ml of TGEV antigen-GNPs (antigen concentration, 12.5 \u03bcg per animal). Group 2 received 1 ml of TGEV antigen solution (12.5 \u03bcg per animal). Group 3 served as the control, which received 1 ml of physiological saline. Group 4 served as the control GNPs, which received 1 ml of GNPs solution. GNP-antigen group was in comparison with group which received only physiological saline (control group). The animals were killed 10 days after the last injection, and blood serum samples were taken for immunological studies. Immediately after removal, all pieces of tissues and organs were placed in a fixing solution (10% aqueous neutral formalin), and then 15-\u03bcm-thick histological sections were prepared on a freezing microtome, model 2515 (Reichert Wien, Austria). All histological samples were stained with hematoxylin-eosin.\n\nFor isolating peritoneal macrophages, the animals were killed and then fixed on their backs. An incision was made along the midline of the anterior abdominal wall, and the skin flap was carefully separated, with care taken to keep the peritoneum intact. After a puncture had been made with a needle connected to a syringe, 50 ml of PBS, pH 7.2, was injected into the peritoneal cavity. The anterior abdominal wall was then gently massaged, and after 5-7 min, peritoneal fluid was collected with a Pasteur pipet through a cut made in the peritoneum and was filtered into a test tube through a nylon filter. The cells were washed three times by centrifugation in PBS at 750 g, after which they were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS and counted in a Goryaev chamber. Peritoneal macrophages were cultured by standard procedures (Leiter 2001) .\n\nFor isolating splenic lymphocytes, an incision was made along the white line of the peritoneum after peritoneal macrophages had been isolated, and the spleen was removed. The spleen was minced with scissors, and the tissue pieces were mashed through a fine sieve into a petri plate containing sterile PBS. The resulting suspension was subjected to ficoll-urografin density-gradient centrifugation. The lymphocyte ring was collected in a new test tube. The lymphocytes were washed three times by centrifugation in PBS, pH 7.4, at 750 g for 10 min, and the cell sediment was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. The lymphocytic cells were counted with a HaemaScreenvet hematology analyzer (Hospitex Diagnostics, Italy).\n\nThe titer of antibodies in the sera was estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies against guinea pig IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, UK). The synthetic peptide was used as the immobilized antigen. The reaction results were recorded on a Plate Screen microplate spectrophotometer. The interleukin concentration in the sera was measured with a Plate Screen analyzer (Hospitex Diagnostics, Italy) and using reagents of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and INF-\u03b3 (Vector-Best, Russia).\n\nRespiratory activity was measured conventionally (Bernas and Dobrucki 2000) by the ability of cells to reduce nitrotetrazolium blue [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, MTT (Sigma-Aldrich)] to formazan. Briefly, suspensions of known concentrations of isolated animal cells (macrophages and lymphocytes) were centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min, and the sediment was resuspended in 1 ml of 0.05% MTT and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. After incubation, the cells were centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min and the sediment was resuspended in 0.5 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (Fluka, Switzerland). The amount of reduced formazan was measured with a Genesys 10S UV-vis spectrophotometer at 490 nm. To construct the calibration curve, we used commercial formazan (Sigma-Aldrich) at 0.002, 0.02, 0.2, and 2 mg ml \u22121 .\n\nFor studying possible morphological changes in the spleen as an important part of the macrophage system, the animals were immunized with TGEV antigen-GNPs. The control group comprised of nonimmunized animals. We used the spleens of guinea pigs of the same physiological age. Longitudinal and transverse spleen sections (15-\u03bcm-thick) were prepared on a freezing microtome, model 2515 (Reichert Wien, Austria), by following standard procedures. Histological sections were differentially stained with hematoxylin-eosin.\n\nThe results were statistically processed by the standard procedures using Student's t test to evaluate the reliability of the differences between samplings in the experimental and control studies. After the arithmetic mean and the standard deviation for a given data sample were found, we determined the standard error of the arithmetic mean and its confidence limits by Student's t coefficient (n, p) at a significance level of 95% (p = 0.05).\n\nThe obtained results were statistically processed by the standard procedures integrated in Excel 2007 software (Microsoft Corp., USA). After the arithmetic mean and the standard deviation for a given data sample had been found, we determined the standard error of the arithmetic mean and its confidence limits with account of Student's t coefficient (n, p) [number of measurements n = 9, significance level = 95% (p = 0.05)]. These results are presented as histograms. The significance of differences between individual samples was evaluated by a two-sample unpaired Student's t test with unequal variances. Differences were considered significant when the experimentally found p exp value was \u2264 0.05.\n\nThe reliability of the changes recorded in the results of each of the experiments described above for the entire set of antigen formulations examined was assessed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) by using Fisher's ratio test. The dependences found were considered significant at F > F crit , where the critical value F crit at n = 9 and m = 4-5 (number of data sets) corresponded to p = 0.05 (with the number of degrees of freedom (df) lying between 4 and 14) and the effective value p eff was < 0.05.\n\nSwine transmissible gastroenteritis is caused by an RNA virus belonging to group 1\u0430 of the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. The virion has a spherical shape with a diameter of 75-160 nm (Martins et al. 2013) . The viral nucleocapsid is a flexible spiral containing single-stranded RNA and a large number of nucleocapsid protein molecules (Delmas et al. 1986; Sturman et al. 1985) . The virus replicates in the cytoplasm of mature epithelial cells located at the ends of the intestine villi. A general scheme of the experiment is depicted in Fig. 1 .\n\nAfter the antigen was isolated and its protein composition was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, we found that the molecular masses of the separated proteins were identical to those of the TGEV proteins. The antigen contained the following proteins: P protein (large surface glycoprotein S; molecular mass, 170-200 kDa), N protein (basic nucleocapsid protein, 50-62 kDa), and M protein (matrix membrane protein, 25-35 kDa) (Fig. 2) . A protein fraction of 15-17 kDa was also present. According to Wesley et al. (1991) , 17 kDa is the size of an unglycated structural protein of TGEV. Thus, all known TGEV proteins were separated.\n\nThe TGEV nucleic acid was identified by PCR using a specific primer-a conservative part of TGEV's S genome, containing 886 bp. Analysis of the PCR products from a purified preparation of the TGEV strain VN-96, which was done by agarose gel electrophoresis with DNA Ladder 100, demonstrated sufficiently high separation of cDNA (Fig. 3) . The presence of only a characteristic cDNA fraction (size, 886 bp) indicated the presence of the TGEV genome in the sample.\n\nAfter the virus's nucleic acid was inactivated with ribonuclease, the resultant antigen (a mixture of viral capsid proteins) was used for conjugation with GNPs and for subsequent animal immunization. The GNP diameter was measured by TEM, the average particle size was 15.7 nm. Analysis of the antibody titer data showed that the titer produced by immunization with GNP-antigen conjugates (1:15018.67; p = 0.0014) was higher than that produced by immunization with unconjugated TGEV antigen (1:6826.67).\n\nIn immunology, the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) (also known previously as the reticuloendothelial or macrophage system) is part of the immune system that consists of phagocytic cells located in reticular connective tissue. The cells are primarily monocytes and macrophages, which accumulate in lymph nodes and in the spleen. The effectiveness of interaction of the GNP-antigen conjugate with cells of the reticuloendothelial system was evaluated using the MTT test. On day 10 after immunization, an increase in the respiratory activity of macrophages was noted (Fig. 4) . After immunization with the GNP-antigen conjugate, the activity increased by 97% (p = 0.003) as compared with the control and by 75% (\u0440 = 0.0015) as compared with the immunization with TGEV antigen and 79% (\u0440 = 0.006) as compared with GNP.\n\nA study of the respiratory activity of splenic lymphoid cells (Fig. 5) showed that after immunization with the conjugate, the activity increased 2.2-fold, as compared to the control, whereas after immunization with TGEV antigen alone, it did not change much.\n\nThe data demonstrate that immunization of animals with TGEV antigen-GNPs not only activates antigen-presenting cells but also increases the proliferative activity of splenic lymphoid (antibody-forming) cells. This indicates that GNPs can present antigens to the organs of the endothelial system. The effect of the conjugate on humoral immunity was assessed by comparing changes in the cytokine concentration between the control and experimental animals.\n\nThere was a statistically significant increase in the content of the \u03b3-IFN in animals immunized with GNP-antigen conjugates (Fig. 6) . These animals had the highest content of \u03b3-IFN (59.5 \u00b1 13.6 pgml -1 ; p = 0.023) this group was comparison with group which received only physiological saline (control group). We determined the p value error probability when deviating from the null hypothesis (errors of the first kind). We determined that for our research, p was \u2264 0.05.When the animals were given the native antigen and GNPs, no appreciable changes in \u03b3-IFN content were found.\n\nThe content of IL-1\u03b2 in animals immunized with GNPantigen conjugate was 120.4 \u00b1 23.28 pgml -1 (p = 0.05), which is higher than it was in intact animals (91.04 \u00b1 17.01 pgml -1 ) or in animals given the antigen alone (91.46 \u00b1 17 pgml -1 ; p = 0.96) and GNPs (107 \u00b1 20.6 pgml -1 ; p = 0.16) (Fig. 7) (p value for GNP-antigen group was comparison with group which received only physiological saline (control group). GNP-antigen group was comparison with group which received only physiological saline (control group). The increased concentration of IL-1\u03b2 in the immunized animals directly correlated with the activity of macrophages and stimulated B cells, which produce this cytokine when activated. This point is so important, since it is desirable to avoid an inflammatory process during immunization, which results in the appearance of granulomas. Similar data were obtained with IL-6 ( Fig. 8) . This fact indicates that the injected preparations are stimulatory to cellular immunity.\n\nIt is known that interferons, which possess protective properties, are produced in the body only when the virus enters or tumor diseases. That is why the analysis of the effect of immunization with the help of gold nanoparticles on the change in the level of interferon was made. It was found that in the immunized group, the concentration of interferon increased by 74% (compared to the control) against 29% for the group immunized with the antigen. When immunizing animals with native antigen, no significant changes in the concentration of interferon in blood serum of the immunized animals were observed. Thus, an increase in the concentration of interferon indicates the stimulation of the introduced drugs of the cell link of immunity.\n\nThe results obtained correlate with research in this area by other scientists. For example, in work (Zhang et al. 2018) showed that TGEV N protein induced ER stress and activated NF-\u03baB, which was responsible for the upregulation of IL-8\n\nMarkers protein markers (kDa) Protein P Protein and Bcl-2 expression. Tao et al. (2017) also revealed an increase in the concentration of cytokines including interferon gamma and interleukin 1 in response to immunization AuNP-M2e + sCpG. But he mainly considered the reaction of splenocytes to a given complex (their reaction, which was expressed in the production of cytokines, on the effect of AuNP) was studied. In addition, AuNP-M2e was administered together with sCpG which is a strong immunomodulator. It was interesting for us to look at the production of these cytokines in the body as a whole and to reveal the general clinical changes that can develop on the introduction of antigen and AuNP. One can speculate that GNPs facilitate antigen expression with the major histocompability complex on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. This subsequence ensures that the viral peptides are effectively presented to cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killers. Our data for the increase in \u03b3-IFN activity are in agreement with those for the increase in the respiratory activity of splenocytes on day 10 after the last injection, another indication that colloidal gold can stimulate the release of \u03b3-IFN by T cells, thereby enhancing the activity of lymphoid immunity.\n\nIn guinea pigs, the spleen forms leucocytes and removes old red blood cells (erythrocytes). The spleen framework is formed by trabeculae, which consist of reticular connective tissue, smooth muscle cells, and blood vessels (at the same time, the spleen contains only efferent lymphatic vessels). The reticular connective tissue includes both red and white pulp. The white pulp is a lymphoid tissue that produces immune and blood cells. The red pulp functions to filter blood for antigens, microorganisms, and defective red blood cells; therefore, it contains various blood corpuscles, including large and small lymphocytes, immature leucocytes, leucocytes at the final stage of graininess, and disintegrating erythrocytes. The spleen is also important for the development of humoral immunity and is a B-system organ.\n\nIn the animals immunized with GNP-antigen conjugates, the lymphoid follicles had distinct boundaries and contained large number of densely spaced lymphoid cells (Fig. 9c . The lymphoid tissue was well structured and was located in a compact manner. There was a clear boundary between the red and white pulp regions, and there were full of cellular elements.\n\nFor comparison, we analyzed morphological changes in the spleens of the animals immunized with TGEV antigen alone. The observed changes were characterized by the existence of perivascular edema (Fig. 9d) , sometimes accompanied by proliferation and desquamation of the vessels' endothelium. Moreover, the lymphoid tissue of the follicles became sparse, and the number and density of lymphoid cells decreased. In spleen tissue sections from the animals immunized with TGEV antigen alone, the boundary between red and white pulp was less clear, the size and total number of follicles in the microscopic field decreased, and no germinative centers could be detected. These results point to degradative processes in the immune organs of the animals.\n\nIn the control group of guinea pigs and GNPs, injected with physiological saline, no morphological changes in spleen tissue were observed (Fig. 9a, b) . \n\nGold nanoparticles are stable metallic nanoparticles which have excellent surface functional chemistry, high biocompatibility, and nil toxicity (Pissuwan et al. (2008) . In addition, gold nanoparticles can be easily synthesized, giving them shapes such as spheres, rods, cubes, stars, and pyramids. This quality allows the use of gold nanoparticles for a variety of purposes, including vaccine delivery (Versiani et al. 2016 ).\n\nThere are a series of works devoted to the use of gold nanoparticles as carriers of antigens for pathogens such as the virus grippe (Tao et al. 2014) , virus foot-and-mouth (Chen et al. 2010) , tetanus toxoid (Barhate et al. 2013) , and Yersinia pestis (Gregory et al. 2012) .\n\nIn our work, we used spherical gold nanoparticles (average diameter, 15 nm) as a platform for the antigen for TGEV. The data demonstrate that immunization of animals with TGEV antigen-GNPs not only activates antigen-presenting cells but also increases the proliferative activity of splenic lymphoid a b c d Fig. 9 a Spleen tissue section from the animals immunized GNPs.

Lymphoid follicles have distinct boundaries. d Spleen tissue section from the animals immunized with TGEV antigen alone. Hematoxylineosin staining; magnification, \u00d7 50. Perivascular edema and sparse lymphoid tissue in the follicles can be observed Fig. 8 Concentration of IL-6 in animals immunized with GNPantigen conjugates (TGEV antigen \u0440 = 0.95; GNP-antigen conjugate \u0440 = 0.002; GNPs \u0440 = 0.08) (antibody-forming) cells. The contents of \u03b3-IFN, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 in animals immunized with GNP-antigen conjugates were higher than those in the intact animals or in animals given the antigen alone. The increased concentration of IL-1\u03b2 in the immunized animals directly correlated with the activity of macrophages and stimulated B cells, which produce this cytokine when activated. The increased concentration of IL-6 indicates that the injected preparations are stimulatory to cellular immunity. Several reports have described the development and use of nanostructures for stimulating cellular immunity. For example, Xu et al. (2012) showed that gold nanorods associated with the DNA vaccine may cause increased formation of \u03b3-IFN in HIV-infected mice. Assis et al. (2018) showed that gold nanorods, functionalized with cysteamine and associated with the protein rSm29, are stimulatory to IL-1. In a work, Tao et al. (2017) showed that the use of nanostructured vaccine led to an increase in the concentration of IgG2a, IgA, and IL-1a, IL-2, IL-17, TNF-\u0438 RANTES. Our research correlates with these studies but in the present work we used gold nanoparticles for the first time as a platform for antigen for TGEV. Also, we did nonspecific adsorption of the antigen and did not perform a chemical surface functionalization. This made it possible to simplify the conjugation process, as well as to remove additional procedures related to the purification of the drug from toxic components. Additionally we analyzed the morphological changes in the spleens of the animals immunized with GNP-antigen conjugates and TGEV antigen.\n\nThe microanatomical changes (increased number of follicles) indicate the activation of the B-dependent zone of the spleen and, consequently, the development of a humoral-type immunological reaction (Galaktionov, 2000) . The degradative processes observed in the animals immunized with TGEV antigen alone are evidence of weak resistance to pathogen attack.\n\nIn conclusion, immunization with TGEV antigen conjugated to GNPs as a carrier activates the respiratory activity of lymphoid cells and peritoneal macrophages, which is directly related to their transforming activity and to activation of antibody generation. Furthermore, the use of this conjugate allows marked improvement of the structure of the animals' immune organs and restores the morphological-functional state of these organs. The results of this study can be used in the further development of nanovaccines against swine transmissible gastroenteritis. The microanatomical changes (increased number of follicles) indicate the activation of the B-dependent zone of the spleen and, consequently, the development of a humoral-type immunological reaction (Galaktionov, 2000) . The degradative processes observed in the animals immunized with TGEV antigen alone are evidence of weak resistance to pathogen attack.\n\nFunding information This study was funded by the Russian Science Foundation (project no. 18-14-00016).\n\nConflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.\n\nEthical statement All applicable international, national, and/or institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed."}
