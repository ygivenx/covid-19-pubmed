{"title": "Proteomic Characterization of Influenza H5N1 virus-like particles and their protective immunogenicity", "body": "Influenza is a major infectious disease of humans and animals causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Based on World Health Organization reports (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs211), it is estimated that seasonal influenza epidemics affect 5 to 15% of the global population annually and are responsible for more than 3-5 million hospitalizations and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths per year. Influenza virus circulating in various reservoirs including humans, birds, and pigs shows continuous mutation, which provides a source for the emergence of novel strains. For example, the novel swine-origin 2009 H1N1 influenza virus was declared to be the first pandemic in the 21 st century. Since the emergence of a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in Hong Kong in 1997, recurrent outbreaks of avian influenza viruses (H5N1) pose a greater threat because human cases were shown to have high mortality up to 60%, which is 100 to 1000 fold higher compared to seasonal influenza viruses (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza).\n\nPreventive vaccination is the most efficient way of preventing seasonal or pandemic outbreaks of influenza. The current licensed influenza vaccines are mainly manufactured in the fertilized chicken eggs as a production system. This method of vaccine manufacturing capacity is restricted by the availability of eggs, which may be insufficient to meet the urgent requirements for vaccine during pandemic outbreaks of influenza 1, 2 . Pandemic potential H5N1 virus inactivated vaccines were shown to induce antibodies that protect ferrets or nonhuman primates, and to be safe and tolerable in human trials [3] [4] [5] [6] . In addition, the efficacy of live attenuated H5N1 influenza virus vaccines has been proved in mice, ferrets, and nonhuman primate models [7] [8] [9] . Currently licensed vaccines induce antibodies primarily to the viral HA and display lower protective rates in the elderly and may be poorly immunogenic in young children 1, 10, 11 . Therefore, the development of effective vaccines using alternative technologies is highly needed to meet the demand for pandemic influenza preparedness and surge capacity following a newly identified pandemic influenza outbreak.\n\nAs for advanced vaccines for a wide range of viruses that cause disease in humans, noninfectious virus-like particles (VLPs) that self-assemble by spontaneous interactions of viral structural proteins have been suggested as a promising vaccine candidate platform [12] [13] [14] . Importantly, a VLP-based human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine produced in a yeast or an insect cell system was approved for human vaccination 15, 16 . Influenza VLPs expressed by recombinant baculovirus (rBV) systems that are capable of conferring protective immunity against homologous or heterologous strains of pandemic potential or pandemic influenza virus, have been previously demonstrated [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .\n\nThe protein composition of a vaccine often serves as an important guideline in characterizing the vaccine as well as mechanistic insight into how the vaccine is synthesized. VLPs are commonly considered to be composed of viral structural proteins that are required for maintaining the virus architecture. This conventional view is now being changed due to enhanced proteomics techniques and the availability of annotated genomic sequences for several mammalian species. Recent proteomic studies demonstrated that enveloped viruses in particular have the capability of incorporating numerous host proteins, both into the interior and the lipid envelope of virus particle 23, 24 . However, detailed proteomic information on influenza VLPs is not well known despite extensive preclinical vaccine studies. This present study reports the proteomic analysis as well as protective immunity of influenza VLPs containing HA derived from a human isolate of avian influenza H5N1 virus (H5 VLPs). Proteomic analysis of H5 VLPs identified numerous cellular and vector derived proteins as well as the influenza H5N1 viral proteins HA and M1.\n\nSpodoptera frugiperda SF9 cells which were used for production of recombinant baculoviruses (rBVs) and VLPs were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, CRL-1711) and maintained in SF900-II SFM medium at 27 \u00b0C incubator. A reverse genetic engineered reassortant influenza H5N1 virus which has hemagglutinin derived from A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) and other 7 genes derived A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus was generated as described 25, 26 . This reassortant H5N1 virus was propagated in the allantoic cavity and used as an ELISA antigen and challenge experiments as described previously 27, 28 .\n\nInfluenza H5 VLPs containing HA and M1 proteins were produced using the rBV expression system as previously described 19, 28 . Briefly, to generate the rBVs expressing the influenza H5 HA protein, a full length HA cDNA was derived from influenza H5N1 virus (A/Indonesia/05/2005), cloned into pFastBac, and then transferred into Bacmid recombinant BV DNA (rAcNPV) by transformation with DH10Bac cells. This H5 HA protein contains a deletion of polybasic amino acids in the cleavage site. The rBV expressing influenza H5 HA protein was generated by bacmid transfection with sf9 insect cells and harvested from culture supernatant 2 days post transfection. To generate influenza H5 VLP, SF9 insect cells were co-infected with rBVs expressing HA and M1 proteins at a multiplication of infection of 3 and 1 respectively. Approximately 36 hours after infection of SF9 cells with rBVs, culture media containing released VLPs were collected and clarified by low speed centrifugation (2,000 \u00d7 g, 30min, 4 \u00b0C). Culture supernatants were concentrated and filtrated by Quixstand bench-top system (GE Healthcare) using a hollow fiber cartridge of 300 kDa molecular weight cut-off. Further purification was performed by 30% and 60% sucrose layer gradient ultracentrifugation (28,000 \u00d7 g, for 60 min). The protein concentration of H5 VLPs was quantified by a protein assay kit (Bio-rad, Irvine, CA) and biological activity was determined by a hemagglutination assay as previously described 19 . Briefly, the highest dilution factor of H5 VLP samples or inactivated H5N1 virus that prevents aggregated precipitation of 1% horse erythrocytes was determined to present hemagglutination activity units (HAU) as an indicator of vaccine activity 29 .\n\nThe protein components of purified VLPs were separated by SDS-PAGE. The protein samples (10 \u03bcg) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE using mini-PROTEAN (BIO-RAD) and the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The separated proteins of VLPs were sliced into 10 fractions according to molecular weight. Each sliced gel fragment was used for the in-gel digestion according to previous methods 30 . Reduction and alkylation of cysteines were performed by incubating sample proteins in 10 mM DTT/100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and then 55 mM iodoacetamide/100 mM ammonium bicarbonate. After washing and buffer exchange of alkylated proteins in the gel with 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, proteins were digested with 10 \u03bcl trypsin (0.1 mg/ml, Promega) at 37\u00b0C for 16 hrs. The tryptic peptides were recovered using two extraction steps using 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and then 50% (v/v) acetonitrile containing 5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The digested peptides were resolved in 15 \u03bcl of sample solution containing 0.02% formic acid and 0.5% acetic acid.\n\nThe peptide samples were concentrated on a MGU30-C18 trapping column (LC Packings). Peptides were eluted from the column and directed onto a 10 cm\u00d75 \u03bcm i.d. C18 reverse phase column (PROXEON, Denmark) at a flow rate of 100 nl/min. Peptides were eluted by a gradient of 0~65% acetonitrile for 80 min. All MS (mass spectrometry) and MS/MS spectra in the LCQ-Deca XP ESI ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan) were acquired in a data-dependent mode. Each full MS (m/z range of 400 to 2,000) scan was followed by three MS/MS scans of the most abundant precursor ions in the MS spectrum with dynamic exclusion enabled.\n\nFor protein identification, the complete genome sequences of Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (NC_001623) from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov) and the ESTs sequences of SF9 insect cell from SPODOBASE (http://bioweb.ensam.inra.fr/Spodobase/) were used as the database for MS/MS analysis. The sequences of M1 (AF115287_1) and HA proteins (derived from A/Indonesia/5/2005 H5N1 virus) were added into the database. MS/MS spectra were analyzed by MASCOT software ver. 2.2 (Matrix science, www.Matrixscience.com). For validation of identified proteins, FDR (false discovery ratio) of fewer than 10% was used by Mascot decoy database 31 . The mass tolerance of parent ion or fragment ion was 1.5 Da. Cabamidomethylation of cysteine and oxidation of methionine were considered in MS/MS analysis as variable modification of tryptic peptides.\n\nBALB/c mice (8 weeks old, female) (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) were housed in the animal facility of Emory University, and used for immunization and lethal challenge studies. Groups of mice (n=10) were intramuscularly immunized once with 50 \u03bcl PBS solution containing 30 HAU of either purified VLP vaccine, partially or unpurified VLPs or inactivated whole influenza A/H5N1 virus. For infection, isofluorane-anesthetized mice were inoculated intranasally with 5MLD 50 of reassortant influenza H5N1 virus (A/ Indonesia/5/2005) and body weight changes were monitored for two weeks. All animal experiments were carried out following an approved IACUC protocol (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Emory University).\n\nBlood samples were collected at 4 weeks after a single dose immunization. Influenza virus specific antibody responses were determined by ELISA using inactivated influenza H5N1 virus as a coating antigen as previously described 28 . Briefly, 96 well microtiter plates were coated with inactivated influenza H5N1 virus (2 \u03bcg/ml) and washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). After blocking with 3% BSA for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C, serial dilutions of serum samples were added and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. Then HRPconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies were used as a secondary antibody to determine total IgG and isotype antibodies specific to virus. Ophenylenediamine (OPD) was used as a substrate and the absorbance was read at 450 nm.\n\nTo determine the statistical significance, a two-tailed paired Student's t test using Graphpad PRISM software was performed when two groups of animals were compared. A p value less than 0.05 was considered to be significant.\n\nInfluenza H5 VLPs containing A/Indonesia/05/2005 H5 HA and M1 proteins (H5 VLPs) were produced and harvested from culture supernatants of sf9 insect cells co-infected with two rBVs expressing HA and M1 protein separately. Host cells and cell debris were removed from culture supernatants by centrifugation and this clarified preparation of H5 VLPs showed a significant HA titer of 776 per mg total VLP protein prior to purification processes (unpurified H5 VLPs) ( Table 1 ). As shown in Table 1 , the growth media contained a high level of non-influenza viral proteins. To remove soluble proteins and to concentrate VLPs, we performed ultra-filtration using a hollow fiber filter cartridge with molecular weight cut-off value of 3,000,000 Da. Based on the quantification of total VLP proteins, we found that more than 80% of non-viral proteins and 90% of the volume of culture supernatants were removed during the partial purification processes of re-circulating filtration and concentration (Table 1 ). There was no HA activity in the eluted solution from the hollow fiber cartridge, indicating that the HA activity is associated with VLPs. To obtain highly purified influenza H5 VLPs, the concentrated VLP solution was loaded on discontinuous sucrose density gradients and a visible white band was collected from 30% and 60% sucrose layers after ultra-centrifugation. Finally approximately 99.5 % (3283 of 3300 mg) of proteins present in the initial unpurified H5 VLPs were removed during the purification processes (Table 1 ). In contrast, most of the HA activity was preserved in the recollected fluid and the unit HA activity (per mg total VLP protein) increased about 167 fold during the purification processes (Table 1) . Therefore, rBV expressed HA proteins in insect cells are likely to be targeted onto the SF9 cell membrane and incorporated into VLPs in a functionally active form. These results suggest that VLPs are easily purified to high quality by removing over 99% of non-particulate proteins present in the culture supernatants.\n\nSeasonal and pandemic influenza VLPs produced in insect cells were shown to confer protection, which suggests that influenza VLPs are a promising vaccine candidate. However, the protein components of VLPs produced in insect cells remain unknown. To identify protein components of purified H5 VLPs by MS/MS analysis, the proteins of VLPs separated on the 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel were divided into 10 fractions and were subjected to in-gel protease digestion to generate polypeptides (Fig. 1A) . Most tryptic peptides were detected at a high frequency (three times out of three analyses), and those detected more than two out of three times analysis were included for identification of proteins. Based on the MS/MS analysis using an LCQ Deca XP, over 37 proteins originated from SF9 host cells and were found to be associated with H5 VLPs ( Table 2 ). The EST database of SF9 cell contains 5822 sequences. Because the EST database of SF9 cells used for protein identification was not annotated, sequence homology analysis of each EST sequence was performed using the Uniprot insert database.\n\nA variety of proteins important for cell biology was identified. As representatively shown in Fig. 1A , these host proteins include heat shock protein 90 known to be involved in protein folding and cytoskeleton proteins such as alpha/beta tubulins and a cytoplasmic actin. Also, H5 VLPs were found to be associated with host proteins involved in vesicular trafficking (ADP-ribosylation factor, vesicle-associated membrane protein, vacuolar protein sorting 28, myosin II essential light chain), ribosomal proteins, putative ubiquitin/ribosomal protein S27Ae fusion protein, and cell signaling related proteins (heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein gamma subunit-like protein, Rho1) ( Table 2 ). In addition, many proteins with enzyme activities were found. A range of additional proteins include those related to reduction-oxidation controls, metabolism, and signaling (Table 2) . Therefore, these results suggest that many host proteins with various biological functions are associated with and/or incorporated into VLPs during their formation in host cells.\n\nThe information on the genome database containing 156 known genes of Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus made it possible to identify baculovirus-derived proteins in H5 VLPs (Table 3 ). As expected, many vector-derived proteins were also found to be in H5 VLPs. The proteomic analysis shows the presence of structural proteins that are known to be involved in virus or VLP formation (Table 3 and Fig. 1B) . These structural proteins include occlusion derived and polyhedron associated proteins (AcOrf-102, -114), capsid or capsid associated proteins, and envelope proteins (Table 3) . Also, proteins with regulatory and/or enzyme activity functions were found. However, an essential 78-kDa phosphoprotein and a 6.9-kDa major core protein with a small arginine-rich polypeptide were not found, which are known to be important for the formation of nucleoprotein complex of baculovirions 32, 33 . Nonetheless, these results indicate that there are some baculovirus-derived proteins in the preparation of purified H5 VLPs.\n\nProteome analysis results showed that H5 and M1 proteins were located in the fraction numbers 8 and 5 at the respectively expected location. The sequence coverage of H5 and M1 proteins were 46% and 70%, respectively, indicating their high accuracy. However, our analysis results showed that the thick protein band in fraction number 8 contained a baculovirus envelope glycoprotein as well as influenza H5 HA proteins. M1 protein was found to be a major protein in fraction number 5 although this fraction also included several proteins such as glutathione S-transferase sigma and apoptosis inhibitor proteins (Fig. 1) .\n\nTo investigate the effect of non-influenza components on inducing protective immunity, BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with purified H5 VLPs, or partially purified or unpurified H5VLPs. Different levels of purity of H5 VLP preparations used for immunization were shown in Table 1 . Also, a control group of mice that was immunized with inactivated whole H5N1 virus produced from fertilized egg substrates was included as a comparative control (Fig. 2) . The doses of H5 VLPs and inactivated H5N1 virus vaccines were normalized based on the amount of HA, which is equivalent to 30 HAU in PBS. Mouse sera were collected at 4 weeks post single immunization and the levels of virus specific antibodies were determined by ELISA. All groups of VLP-vaccinated mice induced robust antibody responses specific to H5N1 influenza virus. Nonetheless, we observed differences among groups immunized with H5 VLPs containing different levels of noninfluenza components. There were decreases in IgG antibody responses in groups of mice immunized with unpurified VLPs (p=0.011) or partially purified VLPs (p= 0.045) compared to the group of purified VLPs that showed the highest level of antibodies specific to H5N1 virus ( Fig. 2A) . Importantly, immunization with H5 VLPs induced virus-specific antibodies at similar or higher levels compared to those by inactivated whole H5N1 virus. Interestingly, it was noted that partially purified VLPs also elicited levels of antibody responses which were not statistically different compared to purified inactivated virus vaccine.\n\nCytokines secreted by subsets of antigen-specific helper T cells regulate the production of different IgG isotypes. Thus the distribution of IgG antibody isotypes elicited by vaccination is indicative of the type of T cell immune response. Immunization with H5 VLPs induced the IgG2a isotype dominantly regardless of different levels of non-influenza components (Fig. 2B) . In contrast, influenza VLPs produced in mammalian cells were previously demonstrated to elicit IgG1 isotype antibody predominantly 34 . Interestingly, a similar pattern of IgG2a dominant antibody responses was elicited by both whole inactivated virus vaccines prepared from Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in a previous study 34 or propagated in egg substrates in this study. Therefore, these results suggest that different patterns of immune responses observed may be reflected by different vectors and/or cell types producing VLPs.\n\nWe have determined the HI antibody titers in different groups and found that their HI titers were very low in a range of 0 to 20. Considering low hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers induced in vaccinated mice, it thus is important to determine protective efficacy of vaccinated mice with H5 VLPs containing different levels of non-influenza components. At 5 weeks after a single dose of immunization, mice were challenged with a lethal dose (5MLD 50 ) of homologous H5N1 virus. After infection with a given dose, na\u00efve mice showed a severe loss of body weight and all died. In contrast, both groups of mice that received a single dose of highly purified or partially purified H5 VLPs showed no loss in body weight and were 100% protected as observed in the inactivated whole virus group (Fig.  3) . Meanwhile, the group of mice immunized with unpurified H5 VLPs displayed a moderate loss in body weight up to 8% transiently (Fig. 3A) and then recovered to normal weight although 100% mice in this group survived (Fig. 3B) . These results suggest that both highly and partially purified H5 VLPs provide comparable protective immunity as the inactivated whole viral vaccine, and that even a single dose of unpurified H5 VLPs can provide 100% survival protection in a mouse model.\n\nInfluenza VLP vaccines produced by the rBV expression system in insect cells are known to provide protective immunity against influenza virus and thus have been suggested to be a promising vaccine candidate. Despite the fact that VLPs can be clinically relevant vaccines, there is significant gap in our understanding of detailed information on the VLP formation and composition. The present study has described the proteomic analysis as well as immunogenicity of influenza H5 VLPs.\n\nIn a previous study, 36 host-encoded proteins were detected in influenza virus particles propagated in MDCK cells 35 . Coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus particles were shown to associate with 60 host proteins of embryonated chicken eggs 36 . Our proteomic analysis of H5 VLPs identified 37 cellular proteins assigned to functional descriptions. It is important to note that of these 37 insect cell proteins identified in this study, 22 have been reported to be present in other types of enveloped virus particles (Table 2) , despite using different cell types, diverse viruses, and different analytical methods. These viruses and VLPs seem to share a fundamental feature, suggesting that these host proteins may be involved in the processes of virus and VLP production. This common feature is that all these viruses and VLPs are produced by budding, resulting in the acquisition of an envelope derived from host cells. A possible explanation is that some host proteins that are found to be commonly incorporated may play a role in particular stages during the formation of enveloped viruses and VLPs. It is also likely that VLPs are produced and released into culture supernatants by following a common or similar cellular pathway as other enveloped viruses.\n\nMost of the 37 insect cell derived proteins could be classified into functional groups including cytoskeletal proteins, heat shock proteins, ribosomal proteins and metabolic enzymes. Among them, cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin and actin are involved in the transport of viral components in the cell 37 and also are known to be required for viral gene expression particularly for RNA viruses which encode few proteins 38, 39 . The reported viruses include human immunodeficiency (HIV-1) 40 35 . Viral proteins of VLPs are produced in the cytosol of host cells. Incorporation of viral proteins into VLPs may be dependent on cellular transportation machinery which consists of cytoskeletal and vesicular trafficking proteins as shown in Table 2 . For example, cytoskeletal proteins were found in virions of HIV-1 40 , and \u03b1/\u03b2 tubulins in several enveloped viruses including influenza virus and VLPs 34, 35 . Therefore, regardless of cell types, cytoskeletal proteins may play important roles for the formation of VLPs similar to the cases of enveloped virus production.\n\nHeat-shock proteins (HSPs) have been known to be multifunctional proteins with a role in the folding and unfolding of proteins, vesicular transport processes, and preventing protein aggregation in the cytosol. HSPs were shown to interact with various viral proteins during virus production 45 , and may be involved in the assembly of adenovirus 46 , enterovirus 47 , and vaccinia virus 48 . HSP 90 was found in influenza H5 VLPs produced in insect cells, which is consistent with the results for influenza VLPs and HIV-1 produced in mammalian cells 34, 40 .\n\nInterestingly, H5 VLPs were also found to contain fatty acid-binding protein 3 (FABP3) which was reported to be present in HIV-1 virions 40 . FABP is a family of carrier proteins for long-chain fatty acid and accomplishes lipid organization. Influenza HA protein has a fatty acid binding moiety 49 although its potential role in H5 VLP formation is not clear. We also identified less well known host proteins including ribosomal proteins, signal transduction related proteins (G-proteins, Rho1), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase which are described for HIV-1 virions produced in monocyte-derived macrophages 40 . In addition, H5 VLPs were found to contain proteins previously undetected in other virions, which are related to ubiquitination, oxidation-reduction, translation regulator, and calcium modulation (Calmodulin). It is not clear what roles these proteins might have during the production of VLPs in insect cells.\n\nThe H5 VLPs described in this study were derived by rBVs expressing influenza HA and M1 proteins. Despite the clinically relevant vaccine candidates based on VLPs, vectorderived components in VLPs have not been described previously. In addition to HA and M1, our proteomic analysis identified 20 baculovirus-derived proteins (Table 3) , which include capsid and envelope structural proteins, and some regulatory proteins. Baculovirus proteins are not required for influenza VLP formation since influenza VLPs can be produced in mammalian cells 34 . It is likely that the process of budding does lend itself to the entrapment of proteins that are present at the budding site as the H5 VLPs are being assembled. It was noted that some proteins essential for baculovirus formation including 78-kDa phosphoprotein and a 6.9-kDa major core protein with arginine-rich polypeptides were not found in the H5 VLP preparation, indicating that baculovirus co-purification with VLPs is minimal.\n\nIt is interesting to note that some host and viral proteins appear more than once at similar sizes in the same fraction or different fractions. For example, proteins involved in vesicular trafficking/actin cytoskeleton, translation, enzymes, and protein folding were observed with various isoforms in the same fraction (Table 2) . Also, structural and capsid viral proteins were detected more than once in the same or different molecular fractions (Table 3 ). It is speculated that multiple isoform proteins of similar or different sizes are involved in host cellular functions and viral protein production, assembly, trafficking, budding and release. This phenomenon was similarly reported in previous studies on viral particle and infected host cell proteomics 34, 40, 50 .\n\nIt is important to determine the effects of non-influenza components on protective vaccine efficacy since many vaccines contain heterogeneous components in addition to the vaccine antigenic targets. Unpurified H5 VLPs contain over 160 fold more non-VLP proteins compared to the purified VLPs used for proteomic analysis. Most of non-influenza proteins in unpurified or partially purified proteins originated from the culture media (Table 1) . The presence of excess media proteins in VLP vaccines seems to moderately interfere with immune responses and slightly lower the protective efficacy as shown by weight loss. It is possible that an excess of non-influenza proteins may decrease the effective interactions of HA antigen with immune cells. In support of this possibility, partially purified H5 VLPs (35 fold more non-influenza proteins compared to purified VLPs) induced similar protective efficacy despite lower levels of antibody responses. Also, we observed that vaccination with 3 -4 fold higher doses of unpurified H5 VLPs induced complete protection without any loss in body weight (data not shown).\n\nFor the first time, proteomic analysis of rBV-derived H5 VLPs identified significant numbers of proteins derived from insect cells and baculovirus. Despite the presence of host and vector derived proteins, the H5 VLP vaccine conferred higher or non-inferior protective efficacy compared to the whole inactivated viral vaccine. Split vaccines are a more common format for seasonal vaccination in the US and are known to be less immunogenic compared to a whole viral vaccine 51, 52 . Our preliminary studies suggest that rBV-derived influenza VLP vaccines are superior to licensed split vaccine in inducing protective immunity (data not shown). In addition, rBV-derived VLPs were demonstrated to activate innate immune cells such as dendritic cells [53] [54] [55] . Importantly, this study shows that rBV-derived VLPs elicited IgG2a dominant isotype antibodies indicative of T helper type 1 immune responses in contrast to the mammalian produced VLPs 34 . IgG2a antibody is known to interact efficiently with complement and Fc receptors by virtue of its Fc domain properties contributing to effective viral clearance [56] [57] [58] [59] .\n\nProbably due to single immunizations with low doses of H5 VLP vaccines (30 HAU vaccines are equivalent to approximately 0.25 ug total protein of purified VLPs), low HI titers observed in vaccinated mice are consistent with previous studies 17, 28 . Also, in a previous study with different doses of H5 VLPs, 4 fold differences in dosage did not result in significant differences in lung viral titers although vaccinated groups showed lower lung viral titers compared to the mock control 28 . It was also demonstrated that protection against H5N1 virus was observed in the absence of serum HI activities in vaccinated mice 17 and that HI antibody levels were very low after a single dose of the H5N1 live attenuated virus vaccine 9 . Importantly, it is worth noting that a single dose of rBV-derived H5 VLPs conferred complete protection as observed in the present study whereas two doses were previously used with mammalian cell-produced influenza VLPs 34 . Therefore, in summary, proteomic information on influenza VLPs will be very helpful in elucidating the mechanisms by which VLPs are formed and released, as well as new insights on how VLPs induce protective immunity.\n\none-dimensional electrophoresis-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry VLP Fold increases of protein purities were expressed by reverse ratios of total protein amounts based on starting unpurified VLPs during each purification step.\n\n2 Fold increases of unit HA activity were estimated by unit HA activates of each steps divided by unit HA activity of starting unpurified VLPs.\n\nUnpurified VLP means culture supernatants of rBV infected insect cells after low speed centrifugation to remove cell debris.\n\nPartially purified VLPs were obtained after ultra-filtration of starting unpurified VLP samples.\n\nPurified VLPs were obtained by sucrose gradient ultra-centrifugation of partially purified VLPs.\n\nNot applicable The molecular weights were estimated by EST sequence.\n\nNumbers of gel sliced fractions as shown in Fig. 1 3 "}
