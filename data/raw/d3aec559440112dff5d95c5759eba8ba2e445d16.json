Molecular correlates of remyelination are of interest as they may be quantitated and could therefore provide an index of myelin repair in lesions. Once CNS myelination is set into motion, a series of genes coding for myelin proteins are coordinately expressed in oligodendrocytes, leading to the wrapping of specialized myelin membrane around axons. During myelination, different transcripts coding for various isoforms of a major myelin protein,\n\n. myelin basic protein MBP , are sequentially generated by alternative splicing. Transcripts containing exon 2 and coding for the 21.5 and 17 kDa MBP isoforms emerge postnatally in the mouse and peak before myelin sheaths appear. Exon 2 containing MBP transcripts are then down regulated and alternatively spliced transcripts coding for the mature 14 and 18.5 kDa MBP isoforms are synthesized and mature MBP proteins are incorporated into myelin \u017d . sheaths Newman et al., 1987; Jordan et al., 1989b . In adult mice, during remyelination in a monophasic demyelinating disease induced by a corona virus, the same programmed sequence of events characteristic of developmental myelination occurs. At the site of demyelination exon 2 containing MBP transcripts are upregulated before remyelination. Transcripts coding for mature MBP isoforms \u017d are expressed later when myelin is repaired Jordan et al., . 1990 . Thus, exon 2 MBP transcript expression may be used as an molecular marker of remyelination. The sequence and timing of expression of such a molecular marker during chronic relapsing demyelination has however not yet been characterized.\n\nIn this study, we have investigated the expression of exon 2 MBP as a molecular marker of remyelination in the chronic relapsing autoimmune demyelinating disease, ex-\u017d . perimental allergic encephalomyelitis EAE , in adult mice.

The expression of exon 2 containing transcripts of MBP within spinal cord lesions was assessed by in situ hybridization during the course of chronic relapsing EAE and correlated with various stages of clinical disease.\n\n\u017d . Myelin basic protein 18.5 kDa MBP was prepared \u017d from adult guinea pig spinal cord Rockland, Gilbertsville, . \u017d PA according to the procedure of Deibler et al. Deibler et . al., 1972 . Adult gpMBP almost exclusively consists of the 18.5 kDa MBP isoform which does not include the exon 2 \u017d . encoded sequence Newman et al., 1987 .\n\nFemale SJLrJ mice, age 8-10 week, were purchased \u017d . from Jackson Laboratories Bar Harbor, ME .\n\n(\n\n\u017d Passive EAE was induced as described Pettinelli and . McFarlin, 1981 . An emulsion containing 400 mg of 18.5 \u017d . \u017d kDa MBP with complete Freund's adjuvant CFA Difco .

After 10-14 days, draining lymph node cells were harvested and resuspended at 4 = 10 6 cellsrml in tissue culture medium. An aliquot of cells was used in proliferative assays to confirm the efficiency of immunization, while the remainder of cells were put into in vitro culture with the 18.5 kDa MBP at 25 mgrml.

Details of the MBP immunization and transfer have been de-\u017d . scribed Voskuhl et al., 1996 .\n\nAnimals induced to have EAE were examined daily for clinical signs. Severity was graded on a scale of 0-5 with \u017d increasing disability, as described Pettinelli and McFarlin, . 1981 , with 4 representing hindlimb paralysis, and 5, a moribund state.\n\nMice were sacrificed at various clinical stages for dissection of spinal cords. Slices of thoracic and lumbar cords \u017d . 2-3 mm thick were frozen in dry ice cooled 2-methyl butane, then transferred for storage at y708C. 8-10 mm cryostat sections were cut transversely through cords. Adjacent sections from the same spinal cord regions were mounted on silane treated slides and used for in situ \u017d . hybridization as described Jordan et al., 1989b . 2.6. In situ hybridization \u017d . Synthetic oligonucleotide probes 48 mers were designed complementary to RNAs encoded by MBP exon 2, \u017d . exon 1, and proteolipid protein PLP as follows:\n\nMurine exon 2 MBP antisense sequence: CTTGTACATGTGGCACAGCCCAGGACGGCTGCGG-GCATGAGAGGGCAG Murine exon 2 MBP sense sequence: CTGCCCTCTCATGCCCGCAGCCGTCCTGGGCTGT-GCCACATGTACAAG Murine exon 1 MBP antisense sequence: TGTGGCCAGGTACTTGGATCGCTGTGAGGGTCTC-TTCTGTGATGCCAT Murine PLP antisense sequence: TGTACCAGTGAGAGCTTCATGTCCACATCCACAG-AACAGTGCCACTCC Probes were tail labeled at their 3 X with 35 S-dATP by \u017d . terminal transferase Boehringer-Manheim to a specific activity of 1 = 10 9 cpmrmg and used at a concentration of 4 \u017d 3 = 10 cpmrml for hybridization as described Jordan et . al., 1989b with minor modifications. Spinal cord sections were hybridized with probe at 378C overnight, then washed with 2 = SSC and 50% formamide four times for a period \u017d . of 15 min each wash at 408C. Slides were then washed again with 1 = SSC for one h, and then with 0.2 = SSC for another h, each at 458C. Localization of bound probe was \u017d visualized by coating slides with emulsion NBT-2, Ko-. dak , developing, and counterstaining. Slides were counterstained with 0.2% toluidine blue for one minute before mounting with Permount TM . Animals were rated positive for exon 2 transcript expression when specific clusters of \u017d . grains undetected with sense probe were found in association with lesions.\n\nThe onset of EAE was observed 12 to 23 days following transfer. Mice with EAE demonstrated two clear clinical episodes of disease before entering a stage of chronic stable disability with a minority of mice demonstrating a third clinical episode. EAE mice were sacrificed at various \u017d clinical timepoints: the preclinical stage day 4 post inocu-. lation , the peak of the first episode, the recovery stage \u017d . decreasing disability of the first episode, the peak of the second episode, the recovery stage of the second episode, \u017d . Animals were rated positive for exon 2 transcript expression when specific clusters of grains undetected with sense probe were found in association with lesions. Mice positive and negative for detection of exon 2 containing MBP transcript expression in spinal cord lesions are shown in relation to the clinical \u017d . stage of disease and disability score disease grade .\n\n\u017d . \u017d . and C are dark field photographs and B is a bright field micrograph. Table 1 .\n\n35 S labeled exon 2-MBP antisense probe was hybridized with spinal cord sections of 4-7 day old newborn mice to detect exon 2 containing MBP transcripts expressed at this \u017d . early stage of myelination Jordan et al., 1989b . A characteristic signal was observed in white matter using the exon 2 MBP antisense probe, while adjacent sections from the same cords hybridized with sense probe had no detectable \u017d . signal not shown . The same probes were then used to examine spinal cords of mice at various times after adoptive transfer of MBP specific T cells. While a mouse in the preclinical stage did not demonstrate exon 2 specific sig-\u017d . nal, the majority 11r17, 64% of mice sacrificed during the peak of the first episode of disease showed exon 2 MBP containing transcripts in lesions of their spinal cords \u017d . Fig. 1A and B, Table 1 . At the peak of the second \u017d . episode 5r13 38% were expressing these transcripts.\n\n\u017d . Therefore a total of 16r30 53% were positive for exon 2 signal when assessed at the peak of the first or second episode. In contrast EAE mice sacrificed during the recov-\u017d ery phase of the first episode days 3 to 7 after the peak of . the first episode did not reveal exon 2 containing MBP \u017d . transcripts Table 1 . Similarly, when mice were sacrificed 3 or more days after the peak of the second episode, exon \u017d 2 positive cells were again generally not detected Table  . 1 . Therefore the presence of exon 2 containing MBP transcripts was clearly correlated with disease stage. Seventeen of 52 mice examined were positive for the detection of these transcripts. All 17 mice had severe EAE of clinical grade 3 or 4. Exon 2 containing transcripts were localized in cells \u017d . scattered in areas of inflammatory infiltrates Fig. 2 which \u017d . generally indicate active demyelination Raine et al., 1984 . Normal appearing white and grey matter distant from the lesions were devoid of clusters of grains. In situ hybridization signal was also detected in and around the lesions using antisense probes for MBP exon 1, which detects all \u017d . MBP transcripts not shown . To determine whether tran-\u017d . scripts encoding the proteolipid protein PLP were present in the same lesions as exon 2 MBP containing transcripts, adjacent sections of the lumbar spinal cord were hy-\u017d . bridized with each probe Fig. 1C . Within lesions, both MBP and PLP transcripts were detected as grain clusters \u017d . Fig. 2 . The presense of grain clusters suggests that they may be associated with remyelinating oligodendrocytes \u017d . Jordan et al., 1989a \n\nIn passive EAE in the SJL mouse, areas of remyelina-\u017d tion are found in close association with lesions Raine et . al., 1984 making this an appropriate model to investigate mechanisms of remyelination. We demonstrate here that, in autoimmune mediated relapsing EAE in adult mice, MBP exon 2 transcripts are expressed in the spinal cord of \u017d . the majority 16r30 of mice at the peak of clinical disease during the first and second episodes of disease. This molecular marker of remyelination was found only in mice examined at the peak of a clinical episode of paralysis and was rare in mice examined during the recovery or stable phase of disease. PLP transcripts also appear to be upregulated in EAE lesions and may be expressed by remyelinating oligodendrocytes.\n\nWe observed that the signal for exon 2 MBP containing transcripts was the greatest in lesions characterized by prominent inflammatory cell infiltration. Activated macrophages or microglia may secrete factors that promote chemotaxis of oligodendrocyte precursor cells which then differentiate and express exon 2 containing MBP and PLP \u017d . transcripts Kristensson et al., 1986 . Alternatively oligodendrocytes surviving in the lesions may dedifferentiate and express exon 2 MBP containing transcripts as observed in adult human oligodendrocytes regenerating in \u017d . vitro Gogate et al., 1994 . In addition, MBP exon 2 containing transcripts and proteins have been recently de-\u017d . scribed in multiple sclerosis MS lesions by in situ hy-\u017d bridization and immunohistochemistry Cappello et al., . 1995 . Finally, it has been shown that insulin-like growth \u017d . factor-I IGF-I enhances remyelination in acute EAE in \u017d . the rat Yao et al., 1995 . Thus, the detection of exon 2 MBP transcript expression may be a useful molecular marker of remyelination when such therapies are applied to relapsing autoimmune mediated demyelinating disease."}
