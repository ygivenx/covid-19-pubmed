{"title": "Construction and characterisation of a complete reverse\ngenetics system of dengue virus type 3", "body": "\nCell lines and DENV-3 strain - BHK-21 cells were propagated at 37\u00baC in\na humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 in minimum essential medium supplemented\nwith 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS). Mosquito C6/36 cells were cultured at 30\u00baC in\nLeibovitz\u2019s medium (L-15) with 5% FBS. Both growth media were supplemented with 1%\nantibiotic solution (containing penicillin and streptomycin). 95016/BR-PE/02 strain is a\nDENV-3 clinical sample isolated from an 11-year-old female patient during the DENV-3\nepidemics in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil in 2002 (Cordeiro et al. 2007). The patient\npresented typical symptoms of dengue fever. Virus was isolated in mosquito C6/36 cells\n(passage 1) and virus serotype confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain\nreaction (RT-PCR). Virus stocks were produced in mosquito C6/36 cell cultures and stored\nat -70\u00baC. The infectious clone and replicon described herein were derived from passage 3\nin insect cells.\n\n\nE. coli strain, yeast strains and yeast transformation -\nElectrocompetent ElectroMAX DH10B E. coli cells were acquired from\nInvitrogen. Saccharomyces cerevisiae RFY206 ( MATa trp1\u0394::hisG\nhis3\u0394200 ura3-52 lys2\u0394201 leu2-3 ) strain (Finley Jr & Brent 1994) was\ngrown in YPD media and made competent by lithium acetate treatment ( Sambrook & Russell 2001 ). S.\ncerevisiae YPH252 ( MAT\u03b1 ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-\u03941 his3-\u0394200\nleu2-\u03941 ) strain ( Sikorski & Hieter\n1989 ) was purchased from ATCC. YPH252 transformation was carried out by\nelectroporation as previously described ( Meilhoc et al.\n1990 ).\n\n\nPlasmid constructions - Plasmid pSVJS01, a newly designed shuttle\nvector, was constructed as follows: a 2-kb fragment was amplified by PCR from pRS414\n(ATCC). It contains necessary elements to allow replication (CEN6/ARS H1) and selection\n(TRP1) in yeast. The 5\u2019-end primer used on this PCR reaction included a T7 promoter\nrecognition site and a multiple cloning site (MCS). To assemble pSVJS01, the 2-kb\nfragment was inserted into Not I-linearised pBeloBAC11 vector (New\nEngland Biolabs) by homologous recombination ( Polo et\nal. 1997 , Gibson 2009 ) in RFY206\nyeast strain. Recombinant clones were selected in drop-out YNB agar plates lacking\ntryptophan. Purified plasmid DNA was amplified in DH10B E. coli strain\nin selective medium and analysed by restriction pattern on agarose gel\nelectrophoresis.\n\nDENV-3 infectious clone was constructed as illustrated in Fig. 1 . DENV-3 genome was amplified in five overlapping subgenomic fragments\n( Table ) using the KlenTaq LA polymerase mix\n(Clonetech), a high fidelity DNA polymerase enzymes mix. The first fragment (F1) was\namplified using primers pSVJS01-F and DENV-3-1860-R. The forward primer used on this PCR\nreaction included an Rsr II restriction site, a T7 promoter recognition\nsite and an additional G immediately before the first base of DENV-3 genome. Fragment F2\nwas amplified using primers DENV-3-1141-F and DENV-3-3521-R. This reaction used as\ntemplate a RT product derived from a DENV-3 infectious clone recovered by in vitro\nligation (JJS Santos & LHVG Gil, unpublished observations) and introduced a unique\nBam HI site into the DENV-3 infectious clone sequence reported on\nthis paper. The third fragment (F3) was amplified with primers DENV-3-3481-F and\nDENV-3-4570-R while primer set DENV-3-4370-F and DENV-3-6700-R was used to amplify\nfragment F4. The last fragment (F5) was amplified using primers DENV-3-6521-F and\npSVJS01-R.\n\n\n\n\n\nDENV-3 replicon was generated by a PCR-mediated deletion, eliminating almost the entire\nstructural coding region [from nucleotide (nt) 454-nt 2336)], as depicted in Fig. 2, and\ncloned as a set of five fragments ( Table ),\nthree of which have been previously described (F3, F4 and F5). The first fragment (RF1)\nwas amplified using primers pSVJS01-F and rep-prM- Bam HI-E-R,\ngenerating a 0.5-Kb PCR product that retained the first six codons of prM. The second\nfragment (RF2) was amplified with primers rep-prM- Bam HI-E-F and\nDENV-3521-R, producing a 1.3-Kb PCR product carrying the last 26 codons of E protein.\nPrimers rep-prM- Bam HI-E-F and rep-prM- Bam HI-E-R\nwere engineered to insert a single Bam HI site in the DENV-3 replicon\nsequence. Both constructs were assembled into Not I-linearised pSVJS01\nvector by homologous recombination ( Polo et al.\n1997 , Gibson 2009 ) in YPH252 yeast\nstrain. Recombinant clones were selected in drop-out YNB agar plates, and then screened\nby PCR and DNA sequencing. Functional clones were maintained in yeast to prevent any\ninstability of sequences in bacteria. Genome sequence was deposited in the GenBank under\nthe accession KC425219.\n\n\nIn vitro transcription and transfection - Full-length PCR product from\nDENV-3 infectious clone was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction, followed by\nethanol precipitation. Full-length RNA transcripts were in vitro synthesised using the\nMEGAScript T7 kit (Ambion) with the addition of a 7-methyl-guanosine cap analog\n(Ambion), following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. An aliquot from the reaction was\nanalysed by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and RNA transcripts were used\nwithout further processing. Full-length RNA transcripts were introduced into BHK-21\ncells by electroporation using the ECM 830 electro cell manipulator (BTX Harvard\nApparatus). 2 x 10 6 BHK-21 cells were trypsinised and washed twice with\nserum-free medium, resuspended in 100 \u00b5L Cytomix solution ( Ansari et al. 2004 ) and mixed with 5 \u00b5g of transcribed RNA. Cells\nwere transferred to an ice-cold electroporation cuvette with 0.2-cm gap. Electroporation\nwas performed with two pulses of 100 \u00b5s at 1,200 V separated by 1 s interval. As\nnegative control, BHK-21 cells were transfected under the same conditions except no RNA\nwas added (mock). After electroporation, cells were allowed to recover for 10 min at\nroom temperature and resuspended in complete growth medium.\n\n\nImmunofluorescence assay (IFA) - To detect DENV-3 virus antigen,\ntransfected cells were seeded onto glass coverslips. At different time points,\nRNA-transfected cells in glass coverslips were rinsed with phosphate buffered saline\n(PBS), fixed with 50% cold acetone (v/v) in PBS for 5 min at 4\u00baC and air-dried. Fixed\ncells were incubated with a 1:100 dilution of a polyclonal hyperimmune mouse ascitic\nfluid (HMAF) for 1 h at 37\u00baC. This HMAF was raised against group B flaviviruses,\nincluding YFV and the four DENV serotypes. While its reactivity has not been fully\ntested, this HMAF reacts predominantly to E protein. After incubation with primary\nantibody, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00baC with a 1:100\ndilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody\n(Sigma-Aldrich), developed in goat. Then, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and the\nnuclei stained with a Hoechst 33258 solution (Sigma-Aldrich). Prior visualisation by\nfluorescent microscopy, cell were washed twice with ddH 2 0, air-dried and\nmounted. Immunofluorescence analyses were carried out on a DMI 4000B inverted microscope\n(Leica).\n\n\nStability of DENV-3 infectious clone in yeast - To evaluate genome\nstability, cloned DENV-3 infectious clone was repeatedly propagated in yeast.\nRecombinant clones were grown in drop-out YNB agar plates at 30\u00baC for three days. Grown\ncolonies were streaked out in fresh selective agar plates and incubated at 30\u00baC for\nother three days. After 10 consecutive passages, plasmid DNA was purified and genome\nintegrity was assessed by DNA sequencing and virus rescue.\n\n\nDENV-3 replicon RNA transcription and transfection - The entire DENV-3\nreplicon sequence was amplified by a high-fidelity full-length PCR. The PCR product was\npurified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and used as a\ntemplate for in vitro transcription. Replicon transcripts were synthesised using the\nMEGA- script T7 kit (Ambion) with the addition of a 7-methyl-guanosine cap analog\n(Ambion). RNA transcripts were electroporated into BHK-21 cells, as previously\ndescribed.\n\n\nDENV-3 replicon transient replication assessed by RT-PCR - At different\ntime points, total RNA was purified from BHK-21 cells transfected with DENV-3 replicon\nusing the Invisorb Spin Cell RNA mini kit (Invitek), according to manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions. Total RNA isolation from mock-transfected BHK-21 cells was used as\nnegative control. Quantified RNA preparations served as templates to RT using\nSuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) with reverse primer DENV-3-3521-R\n(5\u2019-ggattgccaaacacaagacac-3\u2019), following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Standard PCR\namplifications were carried out using RT products as templates and specific primers:\nDENV-3-1-F (5\u2019-agttgttagtctacgtggaccg-3\u2019) and DENV-3-3521-R ( Table ). RT-PCR products were analysed on agarose gel\nelectrophoresis.\n\n\nVirus titration and growth curves - Virus titration was determined by\nfocus -forming essay in mosquito C6/36 cells, as described\npreviously ( Das et al. 2007 ) with\nmodifications. Briefly, 2 x 10 5 cells per well were seed in 24-well cell\nculture dishes 48 h prior to the assay was conducted. Cell monolayers were incubated at\n30\u00baC with 0.2 mL of serial dilutions of each virus. After removing the inocula, cells\nwere covered with 1 mL of L-15 overlay medium, containing 1% carboxymethyl cellulose, 2%\nFBS and 1% antibiotic solution and incubated at 30\u00baC. On day 5, overlaid medium was\nremoved. Cells were fixed with 30% cold acetone (v/v) in PBS for 13 min at room\ntemperature and washed once with PBS. Fixed cells were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00baC with a\nHMAF diluted 1:100 in ligation buffer. Cells were rinsed with wash buffer and incubated\nwith a 1:500 dilution in ligation buffer of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated\nrecombinant protein G (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 37\u00baC. Cells were rinsed with wash buffer\nand foci developed by adding 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole substrate buffer.\nFoci were counted and virus titres, expressed in\nfocus -forming unit per mL, determined by standard methods. For\ngrowth curves, 5 x 10 5 mosquito C6/36 cells per well in a 24-well cell\nculture dishes were infected in duplicate with wild-type DENV-3 (WT-DENV-3) and\ntranscript-derived DENV-3 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. Cells were\nincubated at 30\u00baC for 1 h. After inocula removal, cells were washed twice with PBS and 1\nmL of growth medium was added to each well. Aliquots of the supernatant of infected\ncells were removed daily and stored at -70\u00baC. DENV-3 titres in each sample were\ndetermined by titration in mosquito C6/36 cells.\n\n\nStatistical analysis - Statistical analyses were performed using the\nGraphPad Prism 4 for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, Inc). Growth kinetics differences\nwere analysed by a two-way ANOVA with a mixed linear model for repeated measures,\nfollowed by a Bonferonni\u2019s corrected post hoc test for pairwise\ncomparisons at each time point. The differences were considered statistically\nsignificant at a p level of \u2264 0.05.\n\n\nConstruction of a newly designed shuttle vector pSVJS01 - Plasmid\nvectors and cloning hosts are critical to successful development of flavivirus\ninfectious clone ( Ruggli & Rice 1999 ). Many\nstrategies to stabilise flavivirus genome aim to reduce plasmid copy number in\nE. coli by using low-copy plasmid or BAC vectors. We sought a\nsimilar approach to lower plasmid copy number in yeast by using a chromosome-derived\norigin of replication. The pSVJS01 backbone is based on pBeloBAC11, a BAC vector. To\ncreate the new shuttle vector, a 2-kb fragment was amplified by PCR from pRS414\ncontaining CEN6/ARS H1 and TRP1. A T7 promoter recognition site and a MCS were also\nengineered into this fragment. Plasmid pSVJS01 was assembled by inserting 2-kb fragment\ninto Not I-linearised pBeloBAC11 vector by homologous recombination.\nPurified plasmid DNA was amplified in DH10B E. coli strain and correct\ncloning of inserts was confirmed by restriction pattern on agarose gel electrophoresis\n(data not shown).\n\n\nAssembly of a full-length DENV-3 infectious clone - Fig. 1 shows the cloning strategy used to construct\nDENV-3 infectious clone. DENV-3 genome was amplified from independent isolated cDNA\nclones in five overlapping subgenomic fragments. All five fragments required to produce\nDENV-3 infectious clone along with Not I-linearised pSVJS01 vector were\nintroduced into YPH252 yeast strain by electroporation and a full-length infectious\nclone (pSVJS01-IC-DENV-3) was assembly by homologous recombination. Sequence analysis\nconfirmed the successful construction of DENV-3 infectious clone and identified one\nsilent mutation at position 9490 (A9490G) in DENV-3 coding region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirus rescue and in vitro characterisation of transcript-derived DENV-3\n- Full-length PCR amplicons derived from pSVJS01-IC-DENV-3 #3 were in vitro synthesised\nand resulting RNA transcripts were electroporated into BHK-21 cells. Cells expressing\nDENV-3 proteins were easily detected four days after electroporation with DENV-3\nfull-length transcripts, as demonstrated by IFA ( Fig.\n3A ). Increasing levels of antigen-positive cells were observed over time\nclearly showing RNA transcripts derived from pSVJS01-IC-DENV-3 #3 are infectious in\nBHK-21 cells. On day 8, pronounced signs of cytopathic effect were visible in BHK-21\ncell monolayers. In vitro characterisation by focus -forming assay of\nthe rescued virus showed no significant difference between WT-DENV-3 ( Fig. 4A ) and transcript-derived DENV-3 ( Fig. 4B ) in focus formation and\nsize. Growth kinetics of transcript-derived DENV-3 ( Fig.\n5B ) was also equivalent to WT-DENV-3 ( Fig.\n5A ) at MOI of 0.1 in mosquito C6/36 cells. Transcript-derived DENV-3 grew\nslightly slowly than WT-DENV-3, but this difference was not statistically significant (p\n> 0.05 at each time point). Both viruses reached comparable virus titres on day\n5.\n\n\nStability of the DENV-3 infectious clone in yeast - In order to further\ncharacterise DENV-3 infectious clone, the genome stability of functional cDNA clones was\nexamined in yeast. Recombinant clones were grown in drop-out YNB agar plates for 10\nsubsequent passages separated by three days interval each. No alteration in growth\ncharacteristics, colony morphology or coloration was observed during these passages. RNA\ntranscripts derived from DENV-3 infectious clone after repeated passages of the plasmid\nin yeast remained infectious upon transfection into BHK-21 cells, as shown in Fig. 3B . More importantly, sequence analysis\nidentified no additional mutation in the cloned genome, indicating DENV-3 infectious\nclone could be stably propagated in yeast for at least 10 passages.\n\n\nConstruction and characterisation of a DENV-3 replicon - DENV-3\nreplicon was generated by an in-frame deletion removing almost the entire prM-E conding\nregion (from nt 454-nt 2336), as illustrated in Fig.\n2 . Only the first six codons of prM and the last 26 codons of E were retained\nin the replicon sequence, as previously described ( Pang\net al. 2001 ). DENV-3 replicon was cloned into Not\nI-linearised pSVJS01 as a set of five fragments by homologous recombination technique in\nYPH252 yeast strain, generating plasmid pSVJS01-rDENV-3\u2206prME. As part of the cloning\nstrategy, a Bam HI site was engineered into pSVJS01-rDENV-3\u2206prME\nsequence to serve as a genetic marker. PCR amplification and digestion by restriction\nenzyme confirmed the successful deletion of the target structural protein coding region\n(data not shown). Full-length PCR product derived from pSVJS01-rDENV-3\u2206prME was in vitro\ntranscribed and resulting DENV-3 replicon transcript was electroporated in BHK-21 cells.\nTotal RNA was purified and replication of DENV-3 replicon monitored by RT-PCR over time.\nOn day 3 ( Fig. 6B , Lane 2), a band corresponding\nto 1,646-bp in length was amplified by RT-PCR. Band size is coherent with the in-frame\ndeletion in DENV-3 replicon ( Fig. 6A ). The same\nband was amplified on day 4 ( Fig. 6B , Lane 3),\nbut the intensity of the band was much higher than observed on day 3, showing DENV-3\nreplicon is functional and capable of autonomous replication in BHK-21 cells. This peak\nin replication of DENV-3 replicon on day 4 is consistent with published results in the\nliterature ( Alcaraz-Estrada et al. 2010 ).\nHowever, replication of DENV-3 replicon is transient and no PCR amplification was\nobserved on day 10 ( Fig 6B , Lane 4). Digestion\nof RT-PCR product from day 4 with Bam HI (Lane 5) generated fragments\nof 1,192-bp and 454-bp, confirming the genetic marker was retained in DENV-3\nreplicon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlaviviruses research has experienced a remarkable progress by the advent of reverse\ngenetics systems in the past decades. However, obtaining flavivirus infectious clones\nhas not been an easy task. The single most reported hurdle in the establishment of these\nsystems is an inherent instability of flavivirus genome in E. coli (\nPu et al. 2011 ). In this paper, the\nsuccessful construction and characterisation of a complete reverse genetics system for\nDENV-3 has been described. This system was developed with a low passage DENV-3 clinical\nisolate. Infectious cDNA clone methodology has been developed for all four DENV\nserotypes and other major flaviviruses, but most systems utilised established strains or\nlaboratory-adapted clinical isolates as parental virus. Even though the value of these\nstudies is unquestionable, it is important to point out the need to expand this\nmethodology for low passage clinical isolates to gain a complete picture in flavivirus\nbiology, particularly in virus pathogenesis, virulence determinants and vector\ncompetence ( Ubol et al. 2008 , Tuiskunen et al. 2011 , Cox et al. 2012 ).\n\nOur strategy employed the use of homologous recombination in yeast cells to assemble\nDENV-3 infectious clone and replicon. Yeast strains are versatile and convenient cloning\nhosts, frequently used in the construction of reverse genetics systems for DENV ( Polo et al. 1997 , Puri et al. 2000 , Pang et al. 2001 ,\nPu et al. 2011 ), because they are more\ntolerant to unstable sequence than bacteria. Homologous recombination in yeast is also a\nsimple and robust method with higher cloning efficiency when compared to standard\ncloning procedures in E. coli ( Gibson\n2009 , Shanks et al. 2009 ). We have\nalso demonstrated the utility of pSVJS01 vector for stable propagation of DENV-3 genome\nin yeast. Several reverse genetics systems were established using low-copy plasmid or\nBAC vectors in an effort to lower plasmid copy number in E. coli and,\nas consequence, achieve stability of cloned genomes. In a previous attempt, we were only\nable to recovery a DENV-3 infectious clone by an in vitro ligation strategy using the\npBSC shuttle vector (JJS Santos & LHVG Gil, unpublished observations). Despite this\nvector has been successfully used to manipulate pestivirus genomes ( Ansari et al. 2004 , Gil et al. 2006 ), pBSC vector carries a 2 \u00b5m high copy number origin of\nreplication. We hypothesised that reducing plasmid copy number in yeast using a\nchromosome-derived origin of replication would allow the successful assembly of a\nfull-length DENV-3 infectious clone.\n\nIn contrast with Pu et al. ( 2011 ), no silent\nmutations were necessary to be introduced to circumvent sequence instability and\nrecovery a functional infectious clone. RNA transcripts derived from DENV-3 infectious\nclone were infectious upon transfection into BHK-21 cells. Transcript-derived DENV-3\nexhibited growth kinetics, focus formation and size comparable to\nWT-DENV-3 in mosquito C6/36 cell culture. Of paramount importance, RNA transcripts\nremained infectious even after repeated passages of the plasmid in yeast. The long-term\nstability of many infectious clones previously described remains largely undetermined\nafter serial passages of the cloned genome in the harbouring host. Only few reports have\nmore closely investigated this stability of continuing propagated flavivirus infectious\nclones ( Hurrelbrink et al. 1999 , Bredenbeek et al. 2003 , Pu et al. 2011 ). Most of their assessment relies on virus rescue\nfrom or restriction pattern of passaged plasmid. Our work went one step further showing\nnot only the ability of rescuing virus, but also that the nucleotide sequence of DENV-3\nviral genome remain unchanged after successive passages of the plasmid in yeast.\n\nDifferent approaches have been used for the construction of flavivirus replicons. We\nused an approach previously described for a DENV-2 replicon by selectively removing\nalmost the entire prM-E coding region ( Pang et al.\n2001 ). DENV-3 replicon was also easily assembled into pSVJS01 shuttle vector.\nIn vitro characterisation of DENV-3 replicon confirmed its ability to replicate\ntransiently in BHK-21 cells.\n\nIn summary, we describe an alternative and effective strategy to bypass flavivirus\ngenome instability commonly observed in E. coli by using homologous\nrecombination in yeast and a newly designed pSVJS01 vector. This reverse genetics system\nwill be a valuable tool for studying the molecular mechanisms involved in viral genome\nreplication, virion assembly, virus pathogenesis and vaccine development. This approach\ncan be applied to others DENV serotypes or flaviviruses."}
