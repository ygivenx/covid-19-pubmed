{"title": "Virus-Vectored Ebola Vaccines", "body": "\nThe Ebola virus causes one of the most dangerous diseases affecting humans and\nprimates. The Ebola virus disease (EVD) is characterized by a severe course,\ngeneral intoxication, and a high mortality rate reaching 90%\n[1-3]. The\ngenus Ebola virus (Ebolavirus) is a member of the Filoviridae\nfamily. Viral particles of all viruses from the Filoviridae family (order\nMononegavirales) have a characteristic filament-like shape, and their genome is\nrepresented by a single-stranded RNA with negative polarity. There are three\nfilovirus genera: Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus,\nand Cuevavirus. Of these, Ebolaviruses and\nMarburgviruses have marked pathogenicity to humans, and the\nEbola virus (EBOV) is the most dangerous pathogen. To date, five Ebola virus\nspecies have been identified: Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV),\nZaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV), Reston ebolavirus\n(RESTV), Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV), and Tai\nForest ebolavirus (TAFV); of these, ZEBOV, SUDV, and BDBV are the most\ndangerous for humans\n[4, 5].\n\n\n\nEVD was first detected in Yambuku (Democratic Republic of the Congo, the\nnorthern part of Zaire) and in Nzara (Sudan) in 1976. In the same year, the EVD\nagent, Ebola virus (Ebolavirus), was first isolated from a\npatient who lived near the Ebola River\n[6, 7].\n\n\n\nSince the time of pathogen isolation and to this day, more than 20 EVD\noutbreaks have occurred, the largest of which (2014\u20132016) turned into\nan epidemic (28,616 cases) and claimed the lives of more than 11,000 people\n[8].\nBy the time of this epidemic, neither\npreventive nor therapeutic agents for EVD were licensed in the world. At the\nsame time, a specific heterologous (horse) immunoglobulin against Ebola fever\nwas developed at the Virology Center of the Research Institute of the Russian\nDefense Ministry for urgent prophylaxis and treatment of high-risk groups; the\nimmunoglobulin had 100% protective activity in experiments with monkeys\n[9].\nDue to the high mortality rate in the last\nEVD epidemic and spread of the virus outside Africa, a WHO Committee was\nconvened in early August 2014. The Committee concluded that the EVD outbreak\nwas an extraordinary event of international importance, which significantly\naccelerated the development of preventive and therapeutic agents for EVD. After\n2 years, several vaccines had been developed. They are currently under\ndifferent phases of clinical trial, and two vaccines developed in Russia have\nbeen registered for medical use.\n\n\n\nThe most effective and economical way to protect against infectious diseases is\nvaccine prevention. However, there was no vaccine approved for use by the\nbeginning of the last Ebola outbreak (2014\u20132016).\n\n\n\nThe development of the first vaccines for Ebola fever began after the\nidentification of the virus and was mainly focused on attempts to\ncreate an effective vaccine based on an inactivated Ebola virus\n(Fig. 1).\nIn 1980, the first candidate vaccine on the basis of a heat- or\nformalin-inactivated Ebola virus was tested on guinea pigs and exhibited 100%\nprotection [10]. But despite the high\nefficacy in guinea pigs, the vaccine did not provide the proper level of\nprotection to primates from lethal infection\n[11]. Another disadvantage of this\nvaccine was the extremely dangerous production condition. All these facts\nprevented the introduction of the vaccine into clinical practice\n(Fig. 1).\n\n\n\nIt took more than 15 years to develop an effective and safe vaccine. This was\nassociated with the fact that the expression features of the main protective\nantigen, Ebola virus GP, remained unclear for a long time. The breakthrough\ncame in 1995, when an article by V.E. Volchkov et al.\n[12] was published. It was shown that RNA editing\nby viral polymerase resulted in several GP forms, of which only 20% were the full-length\nenvelope antigen GP [12]\n(Fig. 1).\nThe same study found that GP expressed in eukaryotic cells\nundergoes extensive glycosylation, which subsequently happens to be\ncritical for the preservation of immunogenicity and antigen protection\n[12, 13].\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the biosynthesis peculiarities of various GP forms led, first of\nall, to the generation of candidate DNA vaccines. The plasmid vectors that were\nused for constructing the vaccines contained the full-length glycoprotein GP\ngene or the nucleoprotein gene of Ebola virus. These vaccines showed a\nsufficiently high protection level in animal studies, with the efficacy of the\nDNA vaccine carrying the Ebola virus glycoprotein GP gene being higher than\nthat of the vaccine carrying the Ebola virus nucleoprotein NP gene\n[14]. However, the use of these vaccines\nrequired multiple (5 times) administration of the drug to achieve a high level\nof protection [15], which was a critical\nlimiting factor for their effective use during epidemic development.\n\n\n\nThe problem of multiple vaccination was resolved as the recombinant viral vector technology\nwas developed (Figure 1).\nIn contrast to DNA vaccines, these vectors provide a high and long-lasting level of\ntarget transgene expression, which enables the induction of protective immunity after\none or two immunizations\n[16-18].\nExperiments with direct comparison\ndemonstrated much faster formation of the immune response to a recombinant\nviral vector- based candidate vaccine compared to a plasmid DNA-based vaccine\n[16]. It should be noted that\nimmunization was associated not only with the humoral immune response, but also\nwith a more pronounced cellular (CD8+ and CD4+) immune response, which later\noccurred to be the key aspect of protection against Ebola fever. Various\nstudies have demonstrated that it is cellular immunity that plays a key role in\nthe formation of protective immunity to the Ebola virus\n[19, 20].\nDirected depletion of CD3+ (CD8+ and CD4+) cells in monkeys immunized against EVD caused\na decrease in vaccinated protective immunity, which resulted in the death of\nall the animals from Ebola virus infection. If only CD8+ cells were depleted,\nthe protective response also decreased in immunized monkeys: 80% of the animals\ndied. At the same time, passive transfer of high-titer polyclonal antibodies to\nthe Ebola virus from vaccinated monkeys to naive ones provided incomplete\nprotection against lethal infection: 75% of the animals died despite the high\ntiters of common IgGs and NtAbs in peripheral blood serum\n[20]. The importance of cellular immunity\nwas indirectly confirmed by the fact that the peripheral blood of people who\nsurvived EVD contained an increased number of specific CD8+ cells compared to\nthe blood of healthy people. At the same time, the number of specific CD4+\ncells did not actually increase [21].\n\n\n\nSummarizing the more than thirty-year history of studies aimed at developing an\neffective EVD vaccine, it may be concluded that the \u201cideal\u201d vaccine\nfor Ebola fever should induce cellular and humoral immune responses, be\nadministered a minimum number of times, and induce prolonged protective\nimmunity.\n\n\n\nThe use of recombinant viral vectors provides all the\nindicated conditions; in this regard, the vaccines developed\non the basis of these conditions were supported by\nthe WHO as a promising direction for the development\nof Ebola vaccines during the last EVD epidemic.\n\n\n\nThe bulk of the developed vaccines for Ebola fever are based on the use of\nrecombinant viral vectors expressing the protective antigen GP, a full-length\nEbola virus surface glycoprotein.\n\n\n\nPhase 3 clinical trials of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based\nvaccine have now been completed. VSV-based vaccines encoding GP of the Zaire\n(1995 Kikwit) and Sudan Ebola virus have demonstrated efficacy in a series of\npreclinical trials in primates [22,\n23]. The high immunogenicity of a\nVSV-based vaccine has been demonstrated in a series of clinical trials\n[24, 25]:\nThe vaccine induced a high level of GP-specific antibodies\n(Table)\nassociated with protection in primate studies. Clinical trials conducted in Europe and\nAfrica have demonstrated that the use of a VSV-based vaccine at various doses leads to\nthe induction of the humoral immune response, with the levels of GP-specific antibodies\nbeing similar. Phase 3 clinical trials in Guinea (using ring vaccination)\ndemonstrated 100% efficacy of the vaccine\n[26, 27].\n\n\n\nA recombinant human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5)-based vaccine encoding\nfull-length 2014 ZEBOV GP passed phase 1 clinical trials in China\n[28, 29].\nAdministration of a high vaccine dose (1.6 \u00d7 1011 vp)\ninduced a high level of GP-specific antibodies at a titer\nof 1 : 1,306 in 100% of volunteers 1 month after vaccination, and the T-cell response\nhad a maximum on day 14 but decreased by day 28 of the study. Six months after vaccination,\nthe GP antibody titer significantly decreased and amounted to 1 : 198\n(Table).\nThe volunteers were re-vaccinated 6 months after the primary vaccination. Four weeks\nafter the re-vaccination, the vaccine induced a high level of GP-specific antibodies\n(titer of 1 : 11,825) in the blood serum of the volunteers. One year after the\nrevaccination, the titer of GP-specific antibodies in the blood serum of the\nvolunteers was 1 : 857. One of the main problems limiting the use of Ad5-based\nvectors is a wide prevalence of pre-existing immunity to Ad5 (the presence of\nAd5 neutralizing antibodies) in the population. The presence of Ad5 antibodies\nbefore vaccination was shown to lead to the induction of a lower GP-specific\nhumoral and T-cell response after vaccination\n[29, 30].\nHowever, clinical trials in China demonstrated that the use of a high dose of an Ad5-\nbased vaccine may reduce the negative effect of pre-existing immunity on the\nformation of a GP-specific immune response [29].\n\n\n\nAnother way to solve the problem of pre-existing immunity to a vaccine vector\nis to use recombinant vector serotypes with rare pre-existing immunity in the\nhuman population [31]; e.g., human adenovirus serotype 26 or adenovirus\nchimpanzee serotype 3 (Ad3).\n\n\n\nThe Ad3-based vaccine passed phase 1 clinical trials and progressed to phases 2\nand 3. Ad3-based vaccine vectors carry the GP gene of the\nMayinga-Zaire 1976 Ebola virus or the GP gene of the\nGulu-Sudan Ebola virus. The results of phase 1 clinical trials conducted in the\nUnited States [32] demonstrated that the\nvaccine induced a high level of GP-specific antibodies (titer of 1 : 2,037) and\na T-cell response, which were associated with protectivity in a NHP model.\nHowever, clinical trials in England [33]\nreported a low titer (1 : 469) of GP-specific antibodies (mean values did not\nreach levels protective for primates); the T-cell response had a maximum at day\n14 of the study and decreased by day 28.\n\n\n\nOne of the problems of the developed vaccines for EVD is the reduction in the\nprotective immune response a few months after immunization. This problem can\nbe solved by using heterologous prime-boost vaccination\n(Figure 1).\nThis vaccination strategy against Ebola was recommended by the WHO as the most\npromising one [34]. It should also be\nnoted that recombinant viral vectors have certain disadvantages (pre-existing\nimmunity to an Ad5-based vaccine vector [35],\nincorrect processing of target antigens when using a\nMVA-based vaccine vector [36], and lack\nof data on the duration of the protective immune response for VSV-based vaccine\nvectors [37]) that can be eliminated by using\nheterologous vaccination (Figure 1).\n\n\n\nA series of preclinical trials in primates\n[38]\ndemonstrated that homologous vaccination with an Ad3 (Ad3\n+ Ad3)-based vector results in 100% short-term protection (5 weeks); but with\nthis vaccination regimen, protection decreased to 33% in 8 months. For\nheterologous (Ad3 + MVA) vaccination, protection was 100% 8 months after\nboosting.\n\n\n\nA heterologous vaccine based on Ad3 and recombinant Modified Vaccinia Ankara\n(MVA) virus passed phase 1 clinical trials. Ad3-based vaccine vectors carry the\nGP gene of the Mayinga-Zaire 1976 Ebola virus or the\nGulu-Sudan Ebola virus; MVA vectors (multivalent MVA-BN-filo) carry the\nGP genes of EBOV, SUDV, and MARV and the NP\ngene of TAFV. The use of heterologous vaccination enabled a many-fold\namplification of both the humoral and cellular immune responses\n[39]. Furthermore, the use of a vaccine based\non an Ad3 and MVA combination preserved high titers (1 : 1,750) of GP-specific\nantibodies 6 months after boosting.\n\n\n\nIn Russia, a heterologous combined vectored EVD vaccine for prime-boost\nvaccination was developed in accordance with the WHO recommendations. It was\nbased on two recombinant viral vectors expressing the Ebola virus glycoprotein:\na recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-GP) and a recombinant human\nadenovirus serotype 5 (Ad-GP) [40].\n\n\n\nA series of preclinical trials in primates demonstrated that immunization with\nthis vaccine provides 100% protection from infection to animals both 3 weeks\nafter immunization and 5 months after immunization.\n\n\n\nClinical trials of safety and immunogenicity demonstrated that the vaccine\nprovides high safety and immunogenicity levels to healthy volunteers.\n\n\n\nNo serious adverse events (AEs) occurred during the vaccine safety study. All\nAEs were mild or moderate, developed within the first 2 days after vaccination,\nand resolved within the next 3 days. The most common AEs were pain at the\ninjection site, headache, and weakness/fatigue. These AEs are typical of most\nrecombinant viral vectored vaccines.\n\n\n\nThe vaccine efficacy was assessed using various parameters of the humoral and\ncellular immune responses: The seroconversion level was 100%. The mean titer of\nZEBOV-GP-specific IgGs on day 42 of the study was 1 : 3,277 in a group\nreceiving a full dose of the vaccine. Importantly, immunization with VSV-GP\nalone, at the same dose, induced antibodies in a titer of 1 : 538 to day 42,\nwhich was significantly lower than the titers obtained with heterologous\nvaccination. On day 28, a virus neutralization assay detected virus\nneutralizing antibodies with a mean titer of 1 : 20 in 93.1% of volunteers\nreceiving a full dose of the vaccine. The cellular immune response was assessed\nby IFN-gamma production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after antigen\nchallenge: a response was detected in 100% of the volunteers on day 42 of the\nstudy.\n\n\n\nDespite the published data on the negative effect of pre-existing immunity to\nadenoviruses, there was no significant correlation between the level of Ad5\nneutralizing antibodies and the level of a GP-specific humoral and cellular\nresponse in the case of immunization of healthy volunteers with the VSV- and\nAd-based vaccine. This indicates that the use of heterologous vaccination\nneutralizes the negative effect of pre-existing immunity to human adenovirus\nserotype 5-based vaccine vectors.\n\n\n\nBased on the findings of preclinical and clinical trials demonstrating its high\nvaccine efficacy and safety, the EVD vaccine developed and produced at the\nGamaleya Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology was licensed in the\nRussian Federation in 2015.\n\n\n\nEVD poses a serious threat to global security. Since 1976 when the Ebola virus\nwas first detected, more than 20 outbreaks have been recorded. They have mainly\noccurred in the rural areas of East and Central Africa. But in 2014, the\noutbreak that began in three countries in West Africa changed the situation.\nThese were the first cases when the virus was detected in urban centers, and\nthe virus could spread outside of Africa to Europe and North America.\n\n\n\nThe spread of the Ebola virus outside of Africa during the 2014\u20132016 EVD\nepidemic and the high mortality rate were a solid reason for the active\ndevelopment of effective preventive and therapeutic remedies. To date, various\nclinical trials in Africa, Europe, the U.S., and Russia have shown the good\nsafety and immunogenicity profiles of several EVD vaccines. Eight vaccines are\nnow under different phases of clinical trial. Two vaccines\n(\u201cGamEvac\u201d and \u201cGamEvac-Combi\u201d) developed and produced\nat the Gamaleya Research Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology are currently\nthe only licensed vaccines for Ebola fever: The \u201cGamEvac-Combi\u201d\nvaccine is a heterologous VSV- and Ad5-vectored vaccine, and the\n\u201cGamEvac\u201d vaccine is a homologous Ad5-vectored vaccine.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, it should be noted that despite the high price already paid,\nmankind has learned an important lesson: It has become obvious that a timely\ndrive against global threats to public health is possible only if the efforts\nof political leaders, WHO experts, and key pharmaceutical players are\nconsolidated. The combined work of experts from different fields enabled the\nfast introduction of novel advanced vaccines into practical medicine.\n\n\n\nObviously, the gained experience will be used in the future for the timely\ndevelopment of vaccines for other dangerous viral infections, the preventive\nmeasures for which are absent at the moment (severe acute respiratory syndrome,\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus, Zika virus disease, etc.).\n"}
