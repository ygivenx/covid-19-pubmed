{"title": "In trans variant calling reveals enrichment for compound heterozygous variants in genes involved in neuronal development and growth", "body": "Using the premise that effective variants are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with common polymorphisms and haplotypes, linkage and association studies have identified genes involved in the development of traits and pathologies. Upon their identification, the regions flanking associated markers are sequenced to find the linked, penetrant mutation. However, rare variants are often not detectable using LD-based methods.\n\nThis problem has been alleviated by recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) , and the detection of highly penetrant rare variants associated with disease has reduced the heritability gap for such diseases as autism, Crohn's disease, and osteoporosis (Bomba, Walter, & Soranzo, 2017; Kosmicki, Churchhouse, Rivas, & Neale, 2016) . Despite these advances, for most traits and complex disorders the underlying genes and mutations remain elusive.\n\nRecessive traits are caused by mutations in both copies of a gene. The mutations may be homozygous, i.e. identical, or compound heterozygous. Compound heterozygous (CH) mutations are two different mutations in a gene on opposite alleles of a chromosome and it is speculated that compound heterozygous mutations account for many recessive diseases (Li et al., 2010; Sanjak, Long, & Thornton, 2017) . Lack of detection of CH may explain a significant portion of missing heritability for all phenotypes (Li et al., 2010; Sanjak et al., 2017; Zhong, Karssen, Kayser, & Liu, 2016) .\n\nAssociation studies using polymorphisms are LD-based and recent association studies using rare variants compare total variant burden between cases and controls to account for the contributions of multiple alleles at a locus to phenotype. Importantly, because LD-based studies require recessive mutations to be on the same genetic background and total variant burden analyses are not allele-specific, neither discerns between dominant and recessive models of inheritance. 2010). The vcf files were then annotated with minor allele frequencies (MAFs) from EVS (Exome Variant Server, NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), Seattle, WA (URL: http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/)), 1000 genomes and ExAC (Monkol Lek et al., 2015) , and with information regarding the effect of each variant using SNPSift/SNPEff (Cingolani et al., 2012) . The databases used for annotation were dbNSFP2.9 (for MAF and CADD score) and GRCh37.75 for protein effect prediction.\n\nSnpSift was used to remove any variants not inducing a protein-changing event (not \"HIGH\" or \"MODERATE\" impact) based on SNPEff annotation -this includes missense, nonsense, splice-site and insertion/deletion variants. Variants with quality flags and multiallelic variants, i.e. those with more than two known nucleotide values, were also removed. Variants remaining after filtering were cross-referenced with the 1000 genomes variants from the same MAF threshold to ensure that any variants removed from one dataset were removed from the other. The annotated vcf was used as input for VarCount. Ancestry for each exome was determined using LASER (Wang et al.) and this information was input to VarCount via the SampleInfo.txt file. Ancestry and phenotype information for each proband are described in Supplementary Table 1. In addition to the annotated vcf file, the parameters.txt and subjectinfo.txt (containing sex and ancestry information) were used as input. Within the parameters file, the following qualifications were selected: (1) counting at the transcript (rather than gene) level, (2) protein-changing effects, (3) MAF threshold of either 0.005 or 0.01, (4) all within-dataset and annotated (1000 genomes, ExAC and EVS) MAFs, and (5) either compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations. Analyses were run separately for the two MAFs and using all Epi4k probands (264) and only those of Eurpoean ancestry (207) . Because the variants were not phased, VarCount was used to query the vcf file for individuals with two or more mutations in each transcript. The output, a list of author/funder. All rights reserved.

Final counts were determined using parental genotype information. Custom python scripts were used to query for parental genotypes and to count true compound heterozygotes or homozygotes. De novo mutations were excluded in the determination of true in trans mutations.\n\nVcf files for the 2504 participants in the 1000 genomes sequencing project (Genomes Project et al., 2015) were downloaded by chromosome from the 1000 genomes ftp site.\n\nTo reduce input file size, the genomic regions for the hg19 mRNA transcripts were downloaded via UCSC's Table Browser and used to remove non-coding regions from the vcf files. Including all exons from UCSC allowed for a more conservative analysis, given that the Epi4k data were sequenced using various exome captures, which are not inclusive of all possible exons. The variants were annotated and filtered via the same steps as the Epi4k vcf file. Multi-allelic variants were also removed prior to analysis by VarCount. A diagram showing the steps involved in processing and analyzing the variant files is shown in (Figure 1 ). VCF files were queried for homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations using VarCount. Because the variants in the 1000 genomes vcf files are phased, determining true compound heterozygotes is automatic using VarCount. In addition to the annotated vcf file, the parameters.txt and subjectinfo.txt (containing sex and ancestry information) were used as input. Within the parameters file, the same qualifications used in the Epi4k analysis were selected: Analyses were run for each of the two MAFs (0.5% and 1.0%) and for all 1000 genomes participants and using only author/funder.

The final output from analyses was for each MAF cutoff and for each population, counts for every transcript in which at least one individual harbored recessive variants.\n\nUsing R statistical software, a Fisher's exact test was used to detect transcripts with significant differences in the proportion of individuals with homozygous or compound heterozygous variants between the Epi4k dataset and the 1000 genomes dataset. Odds ratios and p-values were calculated using the number of individuals with and without qualifying mutations in each superpopulation. Analyses were performed using all ancestries, and for only individuals of European ancestry. Both Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg adjustments were used to determine significance thresholds after correction for multiple testing. The number of tests was based on the number of transcripts with at least one individual in either the Epi4k or 1000 genomes dataset with in trans coding variants with minor allele frequencies below the set threshold.\n\nThe three-dimensional structure of Protogenin (PRTG) was modeled off the crystal structure of the human receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PDB: 4PBX; 25.1% sequence identity) using MODELLER 9.14 (Webb & Sali, 2016 ). The resultant model superimposed with the template had an RSMD of 4.94 \u00c5 over 442 Ca atoms.\n\nProtein and solvent dielectric constants were set to 2.0 and 78.0, respectively. All structural figures were generated by PyMOL(W).\n\nVarcount is a free, open source tool useful for the quantification of heterozygous, homozygous, or compound heterozygous mutations per sample. Input variants may be phased or unphased. All python scripts and supporting files may be downloaded from Github at https://github.com/GeneSleuth/VarCount. Supporting files include the \"parameters.txt\" file where the user may select variant filters for mutation effect, minor allele frequency, and inheritance pattern (homozygous, compound heterozygous, one mutation or two mutations), and Sample filters based on information entered into the \"SampleInfo file\". Input vcf files must be annotated with SNPSift/SNPEff using the dbNSFP and GRCh37/38 databases. A readme file with instructions is also provided.\n\nA flow diagram with the steps involved in processing of data is depicted in Figure 1 .\n\n[ Figure 1 near here]\n\nWe used VarCount to query the Epi4k dataset for rare homozygous and CH mutations.\n\nThe Epi4k data are whole exome data from 264 trios with a child affected by epileptic encephalopathy, either infantile spasms (IS) or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) (6).\n\nCounts were performed using individuals of all ancestries or just those of European ancestry (207/264). Individuals from the 1000 genomes study were used as controls.\n\nThe individual counts and p-values for the analyses are listed in (Supplementary Tables   2-5 ). Including only rare variants (MAFs below 0.5% and 1.0%) determined enrichment for compound heterozygous mutations in six genes. For combined ancestries, the six genes are in order of significance: OSBP2, PRTG, ABCC11, MACF1, STAB1, and TNC.\n\nPRTG and TNC were also highly ranked in the 1% MAF analysis, with one additional count for each transcript. Variants for all six genes are listed in Table 1 . In our analysis of just individuals of European ancestry, MACF1 was the most significantly enriched gene using a 0.5% MAF. The p-values indicated in Table 1 are for individual tests; there were no p-values significant after correction for multiple testing.\n\n[ Table 1 near here]\n\nThe variants for the three individuals with CH PRTG mutations are depicted in [ Figure 2 near here]\n\nThe de novo variants identified by Epi4K Consortium and the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (Epi et al., 2013) in the nine probands with either PRTG, TNC, or MACF1 recessive variants are described in Table 2 . For the three patients with compound heterozygous PRTG variants, one patient harbors a de novo missense variant in HSF2, the second has a nonsense variant in CELSR1, and the third patient has two de novo variants -a missense in Fam102A and a 3'UTR variant in USP42. De novo mutations were only reported in one of the probands with in trans TNC variants -a author/funder. All rights reserved.

All three patients with compound heterozygous variants in MACF1 were reported to have de novo mutations.\n\nThe first patient has a 5' and 3'UTR de novo variant in FAM19A2 and GLRA2, respectively and the second patient also has a 3'UTR de novo change in the gene LRRC8D and a missense change in SNX30. One de novo variant was identified in the third proband in the gene FAM227A. Polyphen2 categories and CADD scores for each de novo variant as well as missense and loss-of-function constraint metric values for each gene (from ExAC) are also listed in Table 2 . The z-score is a ratio of expected to identified missense variants in a particular gene, and pLI is a gene's probability of being loss-of-function intolerant. These constraint metrics are calculated using genomic data from controls without severe genetic diseases in the ExAC database (Monkol Lek et al., 2015) .\n\n[ Table 2 near here]\n\nEpileptic encephalopathies are a group of severe, early-onset seizure disorders with consistent EEG abnormalities that over time interfere with development and cause cognitive decline (Covanis, 2012) . The Epi4k dataset contains exome sequence from 264 trios that include a proband with epileptic encephalopathy, either Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) or Infantile Spasms (IS). LGS is characterized by frequent, mixed epileptic seizures that arise most frequently between the ages of 3 and 5 (Amrutkar and Riel-Romero, 2018) . IS occurs during the first year of life and is cryptic in its presentation, with mild head bobbing and is often not detected until the seizures have caused significant neurological damage (Kossoff, 2010) . IS often progress into LGS over time.\n\nauthor/funder. All rights reserved.

To test its function, we used VarCount to quantify rare, compound heterozygous mutations in probands from the Epi4k trio dataset and found enrichment for variants in six genes including PRTG, TNC and MACF1. PRTG codes for protogenin, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is involved in axis elongation and neuronal growth during early vertebrate development (Toyoda, Nakamura, & Watanabe, 2005; Vesque, Anselme, Couve, Charnay, & Schneider-Maunoury, 2006) . TNC and MACF1 are also directly involved in neuronal development and/or growth. TNC (Tenascin-C) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein involved in axonal growth and guidance (Jakovcevski, Miljkovic, Schachner, & Andjus, 2013) . Seizures up-regulate TNC in the hippocampus, and in a pilocarpine epilepsy model up-regulation was shown to be mediated by TGF-b signalling (Mercado-Gomez, Landgrave-Gomez, Arriaga-Avila, Nebreda-Corona, & Guevara-Guzman, 2014). MACF1 is a cytoskeletal crosslinking protein highly expressed in the brain and is crucial for neuron development and migration (Moffat, Ka, Jung, Smith, & Kim, 2017) . MACF1 mutations are associated with the neurological pathologies Parkinson's disease, autism, and schizophrenia (Moffat et al., 2017) .\n\nRecently, highly penetrant de novo MACF1 mutations were identified in several patients with a newly characterized lissencephaly with a complex brain malformation (Dobyns et al., 2018) . This new phenotype highlights MACF1 mutations' variable impact on disease pathogenesis. Given both the enrichment in Epi4k probands for compound heterozygous mutations in these genes as well as their known involvement in neuronal processes, we suggest that PRTG, TNC, and MACF1 are candidate recessive epilepsy genes.\n\nauthor/funder.

An analysis of compound heterozygous variants was also reported, using a minor allele frequency cutoff of 0.15%, which is lower than the cutoff used in the work presented here. In this analysis, the parents were used as internal controls, and compound heterozygous variants in 351 genes were identified, without genome-wide significance. The authors only listed five of the genes which are known to cause Mendelian disorders that include a seizure phenotype -ASPM, CNTNAP2, GPR98, PCNT, and POMGNT1. In our analysis using the 1000 genomes participants as controls, enrichment for compound heterozygous variants was not detected in any of these genes. Using the number of individuals with in trans variants in a gene (transcript) as an indicator function required at least two probands to have qualifying variants in order to detect single-test significance, with complete absence of qualifying variants in controls. It is clear from the analyses using either internal controls or the 1000 genomes as controls that a larger sample size is required to achieve genome-wide significance.\n\nThe de novo variants reported by the Epi4K Consortium and the Epilepsy Phenome/Genome Project (Epi et al., 2013) in the nine probands with compound heterozygous variants in PRTG, TNC, or MACF1 are described in Table 2 . Of the twelve genes with de novo variants identified in the nine patients, three are implicated in neurological disease. CELSR1 is a planar cell polarity gene in which mutations are known to cause neural tube defects including spina bifida (Robinson et al., 2012) . De novo deletions of DIP2C have been reported in two patients with cerebral palsy, one of whom also had ADHD, and the other had seizures in infancy (Zarrei et al., 2018) . In another report, deletions including DIP2C and/or ZMYND11 were identified in several patients with developmental delay including three patients with seizures (DeScipio et author/funder.

GLRA2 is a glycine receptor involved in neurodevelopment in which mutations are implicated in autism, (Pilorge et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2017) including a patient with comorbid epilepsy (Zhang et al., 2017) .\n\nOf the de novo variants reported in these genes, the nonsense variant in CELSR1 identified in one of the probands with in trans PRTG variants is the most likely to be pathogenic. However, regarding their involvement in neural tube defects, mutations in CELSR1 are thought to contribute to pathogenesis but not in a Mendelian fashion, as variants have been found to be inherited from unaffected parents or to be ineffective in functional assays (Robinson et al., 2012; Allache et al., 2012) . The nonsense CELSR1 mutation in the patient reported here may contribute to epilepsy in the presence of a genetic modifier. The de novo missense mutation in DIP2C is predicted to be deleterious (CADD = 23.6) and has a low rate of benign missense variation based on constraint metrics (z = 5.82). The de novo variant in GLRA2 is in the 3'UTR so it is difficult to predict its impact on gene function and subsequent pathogenicity.\n\nThe compound heterozygous variants in PRTG, TNC, and MACF1 are similarly variable in predicted pathogenicity, with CADD scores ranging from between less than one to thirty-eight. PRTG and TNC both have constraint metrics indicative of a high tolerance to both missense and loss-of-function variants, while MACF1 is moderately intolerant of missense variants (z = 2.63) and extremely intolerant of loss-of-function variants (pLI = 1.0). Interestingly, aside from the 3'UTR variant in GLRA2, none of the de novo variants in the Epi4k participants with MACF1 compound heterozygous variants are in genes associated with neurological disease or predicted with confidence to have a negative impact on gene function. This, in addition to MACF1's intolerance to missense or nonsense variants, is supportive of the pathogenicity of the biallelic variants in the gene. author/funder. All rights reserved.

We used VarCount to assess enrichment of rare, coding, compound heterozygous variants in a cohort of 264 epilepsy probands and found enrichment in three genes involved in neurodevelopmental processes -PRTG, TNC and MACF1. A missense change at the E104 residue of PRTG was identified three times in two different probands. Significance was not maintained after correction for multiple testing, and larger cohorts or candidate gene studies using a different sample set are necessary to validate this enrichment. In the context of the de novo mutations also present in these patients, experimentation is necessary in order to delineate if the compound heterozygous or de novo mutations, or both, are pathogenic in the development of epileptic encephalopathy. PRTG, TNC, and MACF1 are candidate recessive epilepsy genes and our work highlights that inheritance of compound heterozygous variants should not be excluded from gene discovery or diagnostic analyses of patients with epilepsy.\n\na Phen=phenotype, b Anc=ancestry, c AF=allele frequency, d y/n corresponds to yes/no counts of individuals with qualifying mutations *bp (base pair position) in hg19/Build37 Ancestries: EU=European, E Asia = East Asia, C/S Asia = Central/South Asia, ME = Middle East p-values in bold are the most significant for the specific analysis EU(y/n)d: All(y/n) Ancestries: EU=European, C/S Asia = Central/South Asia; Phenotypes: IS = Infantile spasms, LGS = Lennox-Gastaut syndrome a z-score is a measure of tolerance to missense variants, based on ratio of expected to identified; b pLI is the probability that a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function variants; c Polyphen2 -prediction of a missense mutation's impact on protein structure and function: B=benign, P=possibly damaging, D=damaging (Adzhubei et al., 2010); d CADD = phred-scaled score of Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion, a measure of the deleteriousness of a SNP or INDEL (Kircher et al., 2014) . author/funder.
