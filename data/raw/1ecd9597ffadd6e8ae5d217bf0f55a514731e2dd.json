{"title": "Insights into the cross-species evolution of 2019 novel coronavirus", "body": "The close phylogenetic relationship to bat-origin coronaviruses provides evidence for a bat origin of SARS-CoV-2 [4] . Bats provide a rich \"gene pool\" for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments of coronaviruses, which were established as mixing vessels of different coronaviruses [5] . Although humans and bats live in different environments, some wildlife species are susceptible to the novel coronaviruses in nature, highlighting that the need of tracing its origin of 2019 human coronavirus in wild animals. Previously, researchers had demonstrated that coronaviruses had been detected in pangolins [6] . Here, we explore the phylogenic relationship of the human SARS-CoV-2 together with pangolin-and bat-origin coronaviruses. The similarity analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and the animal-origin coronaviruses demonstrated that recombination events were likely to occur in bat and pangolin coronaviruses (Supplementary Figure S1) Figure 2 ). However, it is notably that 1b gene sequence identity of pangolin/1 coronaviruses were greater that bat-origin RaTG13 coronavirus, with the highest being 99.3%.\n\nThe spike (S) protein mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion [7] . The amino acids of the spike 2 protein of pangolin-origin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 were more conserved than that of the spike 1 protein, and only a few minor deletions of amino acids of S protein were found in pangolin-origin coronavirus compared with the SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Figure S4) . Interestingly, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 was more similar to that of the bat/RaTG13 strain and Pangolin/1 coronavirus. Although the S amino acid identities of pangolin-origin coronavirus exhibited lower amino acid identities with bat/RaTG13, it was noteworthy that six amino acids associated with the receptor binding preference of human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II-464L, 495F, 502Q, 503S, 510N, and 514Y (SARS-CoV-2 numbering)-in the pangolin/1 coronavirus were the same as that of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 2 ), but were distinct from that of the bat-origin coronaviruses. Besides, the PRRA-motif insertion was occurred in the S1/S2 junction of SARS-CoV-2; however, the PRRA-motif insertion in the pangolin-and bat-origin "}
