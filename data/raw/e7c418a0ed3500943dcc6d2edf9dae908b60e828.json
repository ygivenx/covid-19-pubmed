{"title": "An ELISA for antibody the detection of rhinovirus specific in serum and nasal secretion", "body": "Specific antibodies produced after a rhinovirus infection have routinely been detected by their ability to neutralize virus in tissue culture. Consequently, the measurement of such antibodies has been dependent on virus isolation and is costly and time-consuming.\n\nIn spite of this, the neutralization test has been used in both epidemiological studies (Fox et al., 1975) and for the laboratory diagnosis of a recent rhinovirus infection (Hamparian, 1979) . Epidemiological studies have revealed that a large proportion of infected individuals who shed virus do not show a serological response by neutralizing antibody (Fox et al., 1975) . Furthermore, studies in our own laboratory indicate that many of our volunteers do not become infected following rhinovirus challenge even though they have no serum neutralizing antibody (W.S. Barclay, unpublished data).\n\nEarlier studies have indicated that local antibody in nasal secretion measured by neutralization is a more reliable indicator of the rhinovirus immune status than is circulating antibody (Cate et al., 1966) . However, the neutralization test lacks the sensitivity to reliably detect antibody in nasal washings. A haemagglutination-inhibition test has been developed which detected both serum and nasal secretion antibody to rhinoviruses, but prior concentration of nasal washings was still required to detect the local antibody (Reed and Hall, 1973) . Furthermore, not all rhinovirus serotypes haemagglutinate, and so this latter test has not gained any widespread use. We have therefore developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects rhinovirus class-specific antibody in both serum and nasal secretion. In this study, we describe the new assay and its application in the study of the immune response following inoculation with a rhinovirus.\n\nThe rhinovirus used in this study was the untyped human rhinovirus-EL (HRV-EL). Although a member of the rhinovirus genus by physical and biochemical criteria, HRV-EL has not been assigned a serotype number in the collaborative scheme. However, cross neutralization tests in our laboratory suggest that HRV-EL is antigenically related to HRV-12 (C. Dearden, unpublished data). HRV-EL was grown to a high titre by infecting confluent monolayers of Ohio Hela cells in 500 ml medical flats overlaid with 2.5 ml of Hela maintenance medium (BME containing 2% foetal calf serum. 0.13% tryptose phosphate broth, antibiotics, 0.088% NaH,CO, and 30 mM MgCl,). After the appearance of cytopathic effect, the cells were frozen and thawed rapidly 3 times and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min to remove cell debris. Crude tissue culture fluid containing the virus was harvested and stored at -70\u00b0C. Control antigen was prepared in the same way except that the cells were not infected.\n\nVirus antigen for immunization was further purified by fluorocarbon extraction. Thus, 1 volume of Arklone (ICI) was added to 2 volumes of crude antigen, the mixture was shaken at room temperature and then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The aqueous layer was harvested and centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 2 h. The virus pellet was then resuspended in a small volume of 0.3 M NaCVO.1 M Tris buffer pH 7.5 and mixed with an equal volume of Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Rabbits were immunized following a short schedule; 0.5 ml emulsion (at least 10' PFU) intramuscularly in each hind leg followed by 1 ml virus intravenously 4 weeks later. Animals were bled 1 week after this and the hyperimmune serum was found to have a neutralization titre of 1:32,000 against 100 TCID,,, of the homologous virus.\n\nTwenty-one volunteers inoculated intranasally with HRV-EL at the Common Cold Unit who took part in a separate trial (Zerial et al., 1985) , provided samples for this study. Thus, serum samples were collected before virus challenge and 2-3 weeks later, and nasal washings were collected on days 3-7 after virus inoculation according to the standard procedure at the Common Cold Unit, i.e., 5 ml of Hank's balanced salt solution was instilled into each nostril and the expelled fluid was mixed with an equal volume of nutrient broth. Virus in nasal washings was isolated in Ohio Hela cells. All samples for antibody measurement were heated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min and stored at -20\u00b0C.\n\nOn the basis of clinical score (a measure of severity of symptoms assessed at the unit), virus isolation and seroconversion (as shown by a 4-fold or greater increase in neutralizing antibody titre between pre-and postinfection sera), the volunteers were divided into 3 groups. Thus, the first group of volunteers showed symptoms of the common cold (clinical score >lO), and also all shed virus in nasal secretion. We have termed this group 'colds'. A second group of volunteers although infected showed no symptoms (clinical score < 10) but shed virus and/or showed seroconversion.\n\nWe have termed this group 'infected, no colds'. The rest of the volunteers despite challenge showed no clinical or laboratory evidence of infection, and we have termed this third group 'not infected'.\n\nIgG produced in goats and conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Miles Laboratories) was used at a dilution of 1:lOOO in phosphate buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma Chemical Co.) (PBS-T) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Similarly, antihuman IgA produced in goats and conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma Chemical Co.) was diluted 1:lOOO in the same diluent, and antirabbit IgG produced in goats and conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Miles Laboratories) was used at a dilution of 1:3000 also in PBS-T containing 0.1% BSA.\n\nThe alkaline phosphatase substrate was p-nitrophenol phosphate (Sigma Chemical Co.). One mgiml was dissolved in 10% diethanolamine buffer.\n\nPolystyrene round-bottomed micro ELISA plates (Nunc Immunoplates U type II) were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 100 ~1 per well of a 1:4000 dilution of rabbit hyperimmune antirhinovirus-EL serum in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer pH 9.6. The wells were drained and uncoated sites at which nonspecific binding might occur, were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Plates were washed 3 times with PBS-T. One hundred ~1 of a 1: 10 dilution of crude virus antigen, which had an infectivity of about 10' TCID,,, per ml, or control antigen in PBS-T containing 0.1% BSA and 5% uninfected tissue culture fluid was added and plates were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. After washing as before, test samples at various serial dilutions in the same diluent were added and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Plates were then washed and the appropriate conjugate added and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Finally, plates were washed 5 times with PBS-T, and 100 ~1 of substrate added to each well. Plates were left uncovered at room temperature and the optical density at 405 nm was read at various time intervals in a Titertek Multiskan ELISA reader (Flow Laboratories).\n\nWells of round-bottomed micro ELISA plates (Nunc Immunoplates U type II) were coated overnight with 100 ~1 of 1:lO dilution of virus antigen which had been partially purified by PEG 6000 precipitation and ultracentrifugation through a 1545% sucrose density gradient. The starting material for this purification had an infectivity of about 10' TCIDs,, per ml. Plates were drained and quenched with 1% BSA in PBS. The ELISA procedure from the point of adding the test samples was the same as for the sandwich ELISA.\n\nSera were tested in duplicate lo-fold serial dilutions and nasal washings in duplicate 2-fold serial dilutions.\n\nThe means from the duplicates were corrected for each dilution by subtracting the mean optical density (OD) in the absence of sample. From this value, the OD with control antigen coated wells (corrected in the same way) was then subtracted.\n\nThe corrected OD was plotted against the log of the sample dilution and this generated a sigmoid curve. An assay line was chosen at an OD level which intersected this curve in the linear portion for the majority of samples. The ELISA titre was taken as the reciprocal of the sample dilution corresponding to that OD.\n\nNeutralizing antibodies were detected by the standard microneutralization test used at the Common Cold Unit. Briefly, 2-fold serial dilutions of each serum were incubated with 100 TCIDS,, virus per well for 1 h at room temperature. 3 X lo4 Ohio Hela cells in Hela maintenance medium containing 5% foetal calf serum were then added. Plates were incubated at 33\u00b0C for 5 days and read microscopically for CPE. The neutralization titre was the reciprocal of the lowest serum dilution which neutralized 100 TCID,, of virus. A virus titration and cell controls were included in every test.\n\nFig. la shows the measurement of HRV-EL specific IgG in rabbit pre-and postimmunization sera by the indirect ELISA, compared with the measurement of HRV-EL specific IgG and IgA in pre-and postinfection human sera by the same method (Fig. lb,c) . As illustrated, the indirect ELISA detected a high titre of HRV-EL specific antibody in both pre-and postinfection human sera and hence failed to show any specific antibody response following HRV-EL infection although this individual was found to excrete virus, showed serological evidence of infection by neutralization test, and had symptoms of the common cold. In contrast, the sandwich ELBA (Fig. ld,e) demonstrated an increase in HRV-EL specific antibody after infection of both the IgG and IgA classes of immunoglobulins in the sera of the same individual.\n\nHowever, it is noteworthy that the titre of HRV-EL specific IgG in the preinfection serum was high and did not rise as much following infection as that of the IgA class. Fig. 2 shows titration curves of IgG (Fig. 2a,c) and IgA (Fig. 2b,d) immunoglobulins specific to HRV-EL in postinfection sera (Fig. 2a,b) and nasal secretion (Fig. 2c,d) of an infected volunteer who was symptomatic, as measured by the sandwich ELISA. The OD values obtained with control antigen coated wells were low and independent of sample dilution, indicating that the test specifically detected antibody to the virus.\n\nThe highest dilutions at which HRV-EL specific serum antibody was detected, were 1:106 and l:lO\".\" for IgG and IgA, respectively.\n\nThe neutralizing antibody titre for this serum sample was 1:128. In addition, the neutralization test failed to detect HRV-EL specific antibody in this postinfection nasal washing sample, and yet the sandwich ELISA detected HRV-EL specific IgG and IgA in this sample at dilutions of up to 1:lO\".\n\nOf the 21 volunteers challenged with HRV-EL, 4 became infected and symptomatic ('colds' group), 9 were infected but asymptomatic ('infected, no colds' group), and 8 showed no clinical or laboratory evidence of infection ('not infected' group). From these 21 volunteers, 12 were chosen for further study such that a wide range of responses to HRV-EL challenge was represented (4 from each group). The titres of the various irnmunoglobulins specific for HRV-EL were measured by the sandwich ELBA. Fig. 3 shows the geometric mean titre of rhinovirus specific antibody measured by both the ELISA and the microneutralization test for the paired sera of the 4 volunteers in each group. The figure suggests that detection of HRV-EL specific IgA measured by ELISA (Fig. 3b) was a better indicator of the group susceptibility to infection than the detection of specific IgG (Fig. 3a) or neutralizing antibody (Fig. 3~) . Thus, the GMT of the preinfection HRV-EL specific serum IgA was much higher among volunteers who despite challenge did not become infected than among volunteers who did become infected. Furthermore, after infection the GMT of HRV-EL specific IgA and of neutralizing antibody showed substantial rises in the sera of all the volunteers who became infected, whereas the GMT of HRV-EL specific IgG showed only very small rises following challenge among the symptomatic volunteers. Indeed, the level of preexisting HRV-EL specific IgG was generally high and it neither correlated with serum neutralizing antibody rises nor appeared to be relevant for protection against virus challenge. Fig. 4 shows the mean ODs obtained when the nasal washings from the 4 volunteers in each group collected on days 3, 5 and 7 after inoculation were tested at a 1:40 dilution in the sandwich ELISA, for both HRV-EL specific IgG and IgA. The mean OD values for each group showed a distinct pattern. Thus, volunteers who were infected and became symptomatic (Fig. 4a,d) , showed HRV-EL specific increases in both the IgG and IgA immunoglobulin classes after infection. In contrast, volunteers who did not become infected (Fig. 4c,f) , had higher levels of local rhinovirus specific IgA by day 3 after challenge which then fell off during the fol- Fig. 4 .

On the other hand, volunteers who were subclinically infected (Fig.  4b,e) , showed only intermediate changes in specific IgA levels and very little HRV-EL specific IgG Agreement between the sandwich ELISA and neutralization rest data Table 1 shows the HRV-EL antibody titres of paired sera of the 12 individual volunteers as measured by the ELBA and by the neutralization test. When the differences in titre after infection measured by the ELBA for IgG and by the neutralization test were compared, the rank coefficient of correlation was 0.17 indicating no agreement between the two measurements. A similar analysis of the ELBA IgA measurements and neutralizing antibody titre differences gave an r value of 0.53, which illustrated that, although the agreement was better than for the ELISA IgG measurements, it was nonetheless incomplete.\n\nThe ELISA described in this study is a simple, rapid assay which detects rhinovirus class-specific immunoglobulins in both the serum and nasal secretion, It is an extremely sensitive technique, detecting HRV-EL specific IgG and IgA antibody in postinfection serum at dilutions lo\"-and lo*-fold greater respectively than the end-point dilution for the neutralization test. In unconcentrated nasal wash- ings, it consistently detected HRV-EL specific antibody of both the IgG and IgA classes whereas the neutralization test lacks the sensitivity to reliably detect this local specific antibody. This, we feel, is an important feature of our rhinovirus ELISA system since it is now possible to look more closely at the immune response following a rhinovirus infection and perhaps be able to identify the feature(s) of the humoral immune response which may be relevant for protection against reinfection with homologous or heterologous virus. Indeed, preliminary data presented in this study suggest that the presence of rhinovirus specific IgA in both serum and nasal secretion appears to be more important for protection against reinfection than does the presence of specific IgG. Thus, the group of volunteers who showed no evidence of infection despite challenge with HRV-EL ('not infected' group), had high levels of HRV-EL specific IgA in both their sera and nasal secretions. Furthermore, they did not show rises in specific serum IgG, IgA or neutralizing antibody. In contrast, volunteers who became subclinically infected ('infected, no colds' group), had low levels of HRV-EL specific IgA in their serum and nasal secretions before infection, and showed rises in both specific serum IgA and neutralizing antibody after infection. In addition, those volunteers who became infected and who were symptomatic ('colds' group) also had low levels of preinfection specific IgA and showed rises in specific serum IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibody as well as specific IgG and IgA in nasal secretion after infection. These data demonstrate the potential of our ELBA in detecting different components of the humorai 'immune response following a rhinovirus infection. This may be important should vaccination against rhinovirus infection be contemplated. However, in view of the fact that the number of volunteers in this study was small (4 per group), confirmation and elaboration of these findings will have to await a much larger study that needs to involve many more volunteers. The present ELISA data were obtained with serum specimens ideally collected for the measurement of neutralizing antibody titres, i.e., a prechallenge serum specimen and another 2-3 weeks later. Hence, measurements made with these samples may not be optimal for detecting antibody rises by ELISA. Also, the nasal washings used in this study were collected primarily for virus isolation and not for antibody measurement. Therefore, these specimens were also probably not optimal for measuring the sequential appearance and decline of the various rhinovirus specific immu~oglobuIins. Furthermore, a series of preinfection nasal washes would ideally be required to establish the presence and day-to-day variation of any preexisting local specific antibody. Since rhinovirus infection is localized and shortlived it presents a relatively light antigenic load, and so it is expected that a sensitive assay such as the ELISA would detect rapid immunoglobulin responses very soon after inoculation rather than 3 weeks later. Indeed, the use of ELISA systems to detect class-specific responses to other respiratory viruses such as parainfluenza virus and influenza A virus indicated that such responses appear within 3-6 days of onset of symptoms (Van der Logt et al., 1985; Leinikki and Passila, 1976 ). Therefore, it is possible that in this study we have missed the peak of the rhinovirus specific immunoglobulin responses at least in the serum. We are now planning a more extensive and detailed study in human volunteers whereby closely"}
