{"title": "ESTs analyses of Lampetra japonica liver and com- paration transcriptome with the jawed vertebrates", "body": "Lamprey, a living jawless vertebrate, has been regarded as one of the most primitive groups of vertebrates, which filles the gap between invertebrates and vertebrates. Recent archaeological finds indicate that modern lampreyes, compared with the ancestors of 3.6 billion years ago, have little change in morphology structure. Indeed, the lamprey is living fossil [1] . Thus lamprey is the preferred material for revealing the origin and evolution of vertebrates. At present, most studies have been confined to the morphology structure and ecological distribution of the lamprey [2] , whilst other aspects of genomics and proteomics are less known. The transcriptome analysis of sea lamprey intestine [3] and Lampetra japonica oral gland [4] have been published, but the biggest digestive gland-related genes in the liver have yet not been reported. Therefore, the analysis of L. ja-ponica liver transcriptome will provide a theoretical foundation for origin and evolution of vertebrate liver.\n\nNevertheless, lamprey has not been intensively studied until the end of 19th century as a result of its unique lifestyle and morphology [5] . Many of such studies have been focused on the comparative morphology, especially emphasizing the early evolution of vertebrates. For example, some experiments demonstrated the homology of brain genes and pharyngeal structure related genes in the lamprey and jaw vertebrates [6] [7] , and discussed Hox gene duplication mechanism [8] . As an important metabolism organ, liver has increasingly attracted much attention. Savina [9] compared the bioenergetic parameters of liver mitochondria in lamprey and frog during metabolic depression and activity. Rotchell [10] analyzed the catalytic properties of CYP1A enzyme in lamprey liver. Gamper [11] studied the reversible metabolic depression of lamprey liver during pre-spawning. In addition, liver also takes charge the front-line immune defense in the body. Recently, scientists identified a new type of variable lymphocyte receptors from sea lamprey lymphocyte-like cells, which use an unusual gene rearrangements process to produce receptor diversity. This research revealed lamprey has a unique adaptive immune responses [12] . To be brief, Lamprey imprint the evolutionary history from invertebrates to vertebrates, including the evolution information of the various functional genomes. Therefore, further studying on the lamprey liver genome and transcriptome has a very great theoretical and practical significance.\n\nThe two cDNA libraries of L. japonica oral gland [13] and liver have been constructed firstly in our lab. Now we have completed the bioinformatics analysis of the 1280 ESTs of oral gland [4] . Based on the cDNA library of the L. japonica liver, in the present work, we selected randomly cDNA clones for sequencing to construct EST library. After annotating the 10077 EST sequences by BLAST and Gene Ontology (GO), we also compared lamprey liver transcriptome with Fundulus heteroclitus, Mus musculus, Bos Taurus and Homo sapiens. Furthermore, we also predicted the microRNA target within 3\u2032 untranslated region. The aim of this research is to obtain specific expression genes in lamprey liver and lay the foundation for future functional genomics research.\n\nThese L. japonica were collected from the Songhua River in Heilongjiang Province, China. PCR primer, enzymes, RNA extraction kits, RT-PCR kits, sequencing kit, pBluescript II SK(+) cloning vector, and E. coli JM109 Electro-cell were offered by TaKaRa Biotechnology (Dalian) Co., Ltd.\n\nTotal RNA were extracted from the liver of L. japonica using Trizol Reagent. After being isolated and purified using Oligotex-dT (30) , mRNA was used as template to synthesize first-strand of cDNA with Oligotex-dT Linker Primer, and further the double-strand of cDNA was synthesized. EcoR I adaptors were ligated to the cDNAs, which were digested with Not I and directionally cloned into the EcoR I and Not I sites of pBluescript II SK(+). Cloned cDNAs were electroporated into E. coli JM109 Electro-cell and amplified. The inserted clone fragments which are longer than 500 bp were picked randomly for 5\u2032 sequencing. Moreover, sequences were sequenced using ABI 377 automated sequencer.\n\nESTs were assembled using CAP3 [14] to produce contigs and singlets. Sequences were grouped in the same cluster/contigs if there existed a minimum match of 25 bp and the identity greater than 75% in the overlap region. And then singlets were continually assembled until no new overlapping groups. In addition, with the default parameters values, the TargetIdentifier [15] (https://fungalgenome.concordia.ca/tools/TargetIdentifier.html) was used to identify full-length cDNAs.\n\nOrfPredictor server (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gorf/) was used to predict the ORFs of a batch of EST/ cDNA sequences. Based on the largest open reading frame, the 3\u2032 UTR region sequences were obtained. Tar-getScan [16] software was applied to predict mi-croRNAs conserved target sites among orthologous 3\u2032 UTR.\n\nHomology searches were performed with BLASTN against the NCBI nonredundant database. Protein alignments were generated by BLASTX against the Uniprot database. To correlate the unique gene sequence of lamprey liver to a Gene Ontology, the software GoPipe [17] (http://www.fishgenome.org/bioinfo/), which is a tool for integrating BLAST results to streamlined GO annotation for batch sequences, was used to assign the unique gene to a biological process, molecular function, or cellular component. In addition, the sequences without BLASTX and BLASTN matches were further performed domain searches via InterProScan Server [18] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan/) against the Conserved Domain Database. If no homology domain could be found in considered sequences, they may be considered as the firstly discovered ESTs/genes.\n\nFor comparing the trancriptomes, we downloaded liver ESTs of F. heteroclitus (33369), M. musculus (123756), B. Taurus (48787), H. sapiens (251224) from the NCBI database. Based on EST expression profile file and GO associational file, the tool GO-Diff [19] was used to identify functional differentiation of liver transcriptomes among L. japonica and the above four species, aiming to find these especially lower and higher expression genes in lamprey liver via homology search, molecular functions and biological processes. This goal of the research is to reveal the evolutionary adaptation to the environment and specific gene expression patterns of lamprey liver.\n\nThe concentration of the obtained cDNA library of L. japonica was 4.6\u00d710 6 pfu/mL and the average length of inserted fragments was 1.2 kb, which showed that the quality of cDNA library was excellent. The positive clones of the cDNA library were randomly picked for 5\u2032 sequencing. After excluding the poor-quality sequences, vector sequences and pollution sequences, we obtained 10077 EST sequences.\n\nWithin the total 10077 ESTs, 8515 were assembled into 648 contigs, and 1562 remained as single sequences (singlets). The total number of contigs and singlets was 2210. The total length of contigs is 641486 bp with the average length of 990 bp. Most of the contigs consisted of two ESTs (Table 1) . However, there were some large contigs comprised of thousands of ESTs corresponding to Blood plasma apolipoprotein LAL2, Fibrinogen, Vitellogenin, Ribosomal protein L4, Thymus thymic cells cDNA and Acidic mammalian chintinase (Table2). Based on the number of ESTs constituting homologous gene, the higher or lower gene expression can be roughly estimated. Assembly results seem to suggest that the above genes were much higher expressed in the liver of L. japonica.\n\nTo identify the full length cDNAs, TargetIdentifier webserver was used to predict local protein coding regions and potential start or stop codons. The results demonstrated that a total 1040 full-length cDNAs were predicted, including the 65.12% contigs (422) and 39.56% the single sequences (618), which indicated that nearly 50% of the transcripts were full-length cDNAs.\n\nAccording to the distribution of ORF (Table 3) , we found that the length of coding frame mostly ranged from 100 to 600 bp, and 627 transcripts had ORFs of 300 bp (100 aa) or greater. The results seemed to imply that most transcripts likely encoded proteins. In addition, our findings also displayed that 29 ORFs were larger than 1000 bp. Further homology searches demonstrated that the functions of these larger ORFs corresponded to ribosomal protein, fibrinogen, heat shock protein, acidic mammalian chitinase, bone marrow macrophage cDNA (Table 4 ). Moreover, the higher homology alignment score and the higher expectation (E) also confirmed the credibility of assembled ESTs.\n\nThe TargetScan software was used to predict mi-croRNA target sites and their corresponding microRNAs. the ORFs longer than 300 bp. These above results seemed to imply that the 8 transcripts, i.e., contig68, contig600, LLLNSEM008FB09, LLLNSEM011FG11, LLLNSEM055FD08, LLLNSEM134FD08, LLLNSEM-120FF10, LLLNSEM064FD09, may be the firstly discovered novel genes. The present findings provide the useful information for the novel gene cloning and further functional analysis.\n\nTo address the issue of function annotation, based on the BLASTX results, these transcript sequences were annotated using Gopipe software. The results indicated that 664 sequences were assigned to the biological process, 764 sequences were involved in molecular function, and 565 sequences were categorized to the cellular components. We further found, in the biological process, the order of the abundantly expressive categories were \"physiological processes\" (664), \"metabolism\" (526), \"cell growth\" (220), and \"transport\" (158) (Figure 1) , whilst in the molecular function category \"binding\" was the most (356) (Figure 2 ), and the \"intracellular\" was the most expressed in cellular components (427) (Figure 3 ).\n\nComparing the liver transcriptome with the other species showed that, in L. japonica liver, the lower expressed sequences were the genes associated with RNA splicing, DNA repair and cell apoptosis negative regulation, whereas polysaccharides hydrolytic activity proteins were the higher expressed, including chitin metabolism enzymes and N-acetylglucosamine metabolism enzymes. As shown in Table 5 , the expression level of these genes was significantly higher than other species. The number of above-mentioned functional sequences were 22, and 12 of which were homologous to Acidic mammalian chitinase, their expression levels were respectively 123, 142, 70 and 166 times higher than F. heteroclitus, M. musculus, B. Taurus and H. sapiens. In addition, conserved domain search demonstated that the chitinase of L. japonica liver has the similar domain to human, which belonged to polysaccharide hydrolysis 18 family.\n\nL. japonica has been regarded as one of the most primitive groups in vertebrate, belonging to Vertebrata Cyclostomata Petromyzoniformes, which is also the important material for the study of animal evolution. Currently L. japonica is very scarce species and in severely danger situation. However, there are still lacking effective protection measures. Herein establishing cDNA library from different tissues will not only provide useful information to the evolutionary genetics, but also make efforts in the preservation of genetic resources.\n\nAccording to the number of ESTs in contigs and homologous proteins, we can roughly estimated the protein expression level. Among the genes with assigned functions, the most abundant respresentation was Ribosomal protein, Blood plasma apolipoprotein LAL2, Fibrinogen, Vitellogenin, NADH oxidase dehydrogenation, Macrophage cDNA, Thymus cells cDNA and Acidic mammalian chitinase. Furthermore, we found some genes related to the jaw vertebrate immune system, such as above-mentioned Macrophages cDNA, Thymus cells cDNA, Chitinase, TCR, BCR, MHC I, MHC II, Complement factors C3, C2, CFB, Interferon, Transferrin, Heat shock protein ( Table 6 ). Liver is rich in macrophages, which can be used to remove and swallow harmful substances such as microorganisms from blood and absorption with the intestinal by the means of phagocytosis, isolation, and elimination of the invasion and endogenous antigen. Immature T cells grows in the thymus and thymosin can enhance the ability of inducing B-cell mature [20] . Chitin is a kind of animal fiber with a variety of biological activity, including strengthening immune function, and improving disease defense mechanism. Therefore, chitin metabolism may be associated with immunity [21] . The high expression of Macrophages cDNA, Thymus cells cDNA, and Chitinase suggested that they appear to play an important role in L. japonica defense.\n\nComplement system is the central support of innate immune system, and its evolutionary history can be traced back to echinoderms (sea urchin), invertebrate (echinoderms, ascidians) and cyclostomata. They have the most primitive complement system (lectin pathway). As the very conservative widespread innate immune system, interferon is well known to be the cell functional regulation systems emerged firstly in host defense response. Besides, transferrin, an important factor on inhibiting bacterial growth, has antibacterial and germicidal self-protection function [22] . L. japonica, mainly depending on other fish flesh for food, is semi-parasitic animals, and its potential nonspecific immunity mechanism plays an important role in preventing infection which is the more effective way to remove and degrade pathogenic microorganisms and other harmful substances. Therefore, it is likely that the nonspecific immunity of L. japonica plays a greater role in the immune system.\n\nL. japonica has shown some characteristics of the adaptive immune system [23] [24] [25] . They have an adaptive immune response, in which the receptor is divergent to the jaw vertebrate recombinant antigen receptor. Interestingly, they use an unusual gene rearrangement process to produce receptor diversity [12] . Lymphocyte-like cells in the intestine of the sea lamprey were isolated, but no sequences with significant similarity to MHC and T cell receptor were found. The lamprey was considered to reach a stage for the emergence of adaptive immunity [3] . Although the above various factors were found in our EST sets, the similarity was still very low. Significantly, the heat shock protein was relatively abundant. More and more evidence showed that heat shock proteins participated in specific and non-specific immune response. Besides, the heat shock protein, as a molecular chaperone with antigen information, can promote spe- cific immune response and stimulate the body's immune response, but sometimes heat shock proteins can also activate immune reaction [26] [27] . Due to the lack of B cell, T cell receptor and MHC antigen in L. japonica, it was reasonable to estimate that L. japonica tried to make use of heat shock protein to carry out antigen targeting or activating immune reaction in the early adaptive immunity stages. The other representatives which expressed abundantly were involved in protein synthesis and energy metabolism, such as Blood plasma apolipoprotein LAL2, Ribosomal protein, NADH dehydrogenation oxidase, Cytochrome oxidase and ATP synthase. Previous studies had identified that Blood plasma apolipoprotein LAL1 and LAL2 were abundant in lamprey blood [28] . Here, our results demonstated that they were highly expressed in the liver. Apolipoprotein, playing the major role in transportting, dissolving cholesterol and phospholipids, was controlled by the apolipoprotein E gene which was secreted in the liver. Moreover, it also was responsible for inducing macrophage and cholesterolste accumulation, and significantly promoting macrophage proliferation. Mouse liver SAGE data analysis showed that apolipoprotein mRNA expression was higher than 3.8%. Furthermore, the genes which encoded plasma proteins expressed highly in L. japonica liver. In addition, our results also indicated that 123 transcripts corresponded to the Ribosomal protein.\n\nThe coagulation factors including fibrinogen \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 chain coagulation factor VIIa and IX, as well as prothrombin, expressed large. Because the liver was the tissue where coagulation factors were synthesized, it was reasonable that the fibrinogen was highly expressed [29] . Therefore, our findings also implied that the L. japonica might have a perfect coagulation mechanism.\n\nMicroRNA, one of the small molecular RNA families, is a very small section of non-coding RNA sequences, which can mediate negative post-transcriptionregulation. Nevertheless, the majority of animal microRNA do not lead to the degradation of target mRNA [30] . With the corresponding microRNA targets, we tried to investigate the potential regulation.\n\nVolinia et al. from the Ohio State University analysed 540 cancer samples of lung, chest, stomach, prostate, colon and pancreas, and discovered that most micro-RNA overexpressed in cancer, including miR-17-5p, miR-20a, miR-21, miR-92, miR-106a and miR-155 family [31] . Our data also identified the targets of miR-92, miR-17, miR-20 and miR-106 microRNA family. Adult B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) patients often present the absence or downregulation of miR-15a and miR-16-1 cluster [30] . Additionally, we identified the targets of miR-15a and miR-16 family. The microRNA families putatively involved in the regulation of cancer genes are similar in the L. japonica and human. Therefore, L. japonica can become a new kind of animal model for studying human cancer and diseases.\n\nComparisons between different genomes can obtain a lot of evolutionary and genetic information, providing important insight into the origin of vertebrates [32] . L. japonica represents an important transitional phase from invertebrate to vertebrate. Comparing the L. japonica liver transcriptome with the integrated liver transcriptome of F. heteroclitus, M. musculus, B. taurus and H. sapiens can relatively trace certain genes change in the evolutionary process and provide clues on the origin and evolution of vertebrates. By comparison, we found that the genes involved in RNA splicing, DNA repair, negative regulation and cell apoptosis expressed less in L. japonica liver than those in the others. This result showed that some mentioned aspects of evolution mechanism in liver were perfect gradually. On the other hand, the higher expressed genes in L. japonica liver were involved in polysaccharide hydrolysis activity, including chitin metabolism and glucosamine metabolism and so on. These genes expressed about 100 times in considered tissue than the other species. Moreover, chitinase expressed higher in BLASTX annotation, which suggested it must play an important role.\n\nChitinase, encoded by single gene, is a digestive enzyme that breaks down glycosidic bonds in chitin. Abundantly expressed chitinase in L. japonica liver was homologous to the acidic mammalian chitinase, namely AMCase. The chitinase, firstly found the gastrointestinal tract and lung of human, may play a key role in digestion and defense [33] . In the same year, Suzuki reported that AMCase was expressed in bovine liver which may defense crustacean pathogenic microorganisms [34] . The AMCase expressed in peokaryotic system can hydrolyse chitin in the cell walls of T. rubrum and C. albicans, which implies its potential antifungal function [35] . Ov-CHI-1 was a chitinase as a type of chitinase, Ov-CHI-1 was specifically expressed in the larvae stage of Onchocerca volvulus. Various evidence showed that this gene expressed only in 22% of normal individuals, but expressed in 42%-62% of infected individuals. Meanwhile IgG3 and peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) expressed increasedly [36] . A favorable evidence is that the macrophages are expressed abundantly in L. japonica liver. In addition, the immune function of decomposed chitin had been recognized internationally. Nishimura [37] injected multi-porous deacetylated chitin to mice intraperitoneally, and the results showed that the substance could stimulate macrophages to produce interleukin 1 and enhance the activity of macrophages. Glucosamine which was the decomposed products of chitin could also activate natural killer cells (NK) and lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK). Chitosan could induce partial macrophage proliferation, and increase the activity of immune function [38] . In a word, the chitin was immune-related.\n\nIn summary, we speculated the chitinase immunity metabolic pathway in L. japonica liver as followed. Firstly, the chitinase perfects the \"disrupting task\" to the cell wall of pathogenic microorganisms. Next, chitosan stimulates the macrophage proliferation in livers, which can be used to remove or swallow harmful substances via nonspecific immunity. Abundant expression of chitinase in L. japonica liver may be correlated with its specific lifestyle. Chitin exists widespreadly in cell wall of low plant and the shell of fungus, shrimp, crab, insects and crustaceans. As known, lamprey larvae mainly feed on planktonic, lives in freshwater streams, while the majority of adult lamprey are the semi-parasitic animals. They attach to other fish and feed on their blood. In dependent life, they eat plankton. Thus the pathogens from blood and plankton may be the sources of chitin.\n\nConsidered the MHC-I, MHC-II, C3, CFB, Interferon, Transferrin, Heat shock protein immune-related factor and chitinase, Macrophage cDNA, we primely estimated that nonspecific immunity may occupy an important position in the L. japonica immune mechanisms. Immunity should be related with chitin metabolism. In addition, with certain factors of the adaptive immune being found in this article, L. japonica could have the ability of adaptive immune. Therefore, we speculated that adaptive immune of L. japonica might be close but different from the jaw vertebrate.\n\nFor the special status of L. japonica in phylogenetic evolution, it is very significance to construct the cDNA library of L. japonica for further elucidating the functional genome of L. japonica and the evolution of vertebrates. In the present work, the cDNA library of L. japonica liver was constructed. 10077 ESTs were obtained by random selecting clones for sequencing. Bioinformatics analyses of the EST sequences revealed the pro-tein expression characteristics and the potential mechanisms of higher expressed protein in L. japonica liver. Further analysises of microRNA target within 3\u2032 UTR of L. japonica liver transcriptome demonstrated that some microRNA targets were homologous with the counterparts in human cancer gene regulation, which may provide some useful clews for the treatment of human cancer. Moreover, by comparing liver transcriptome of L. japonica with the other four species, it could be found that the genes of chitinase and polysaccharides metabolism were more highly expressed in L. japonica than in the others, which implied that they may play an important role in immunity of L. japonica. According to the present results, we further speculated the unique immune response model and evolution stage of L. japonica. We have systematically studied the two transcriptomes of oral glands and liver in L. japonica. In conclusion, our work will have very important academic significance and application foreground, as well as provide the foundation for further functional gene cloning and proteintomics study."}
