{"title": "Preliminary estimation of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in Iran: a modelling analysis based on overseas cases and air travel data", "body": "In this study, we used the imported cases and air travel data from Iran to other Middle East countries to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases in Iran. Then we compared our estimates with the number of reported cases in Iran to evaluate the extent of under-ascertainment.\n\nWe obtained transport capability of international airlines from 30 major airports in Iran from 1 February to 24 February 2020 (WorldData, 2020), from the Variflight platform (https://data.variflight.com/). We collected the number of exported cases from Iran to other countries in the Middle East (World Health Organization, 2020).\n\nPopulation size of Iran (81,800,269 in 2018) was obtained from the World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/). Table 1 shows the number of daily population flow and total reported cases of countries used in our calculation.\n\nFollowing Imai et al.'s (2020), we assumed number of cases (n) exported from Iran follows a Binomial distribution (Bin) with size N and probability p. Here, N represents total number of cases infected in Iran, and p is the probability that one case .

We approximated p by the ratio of daily outbound passengers of Iran (D) over total size of population (M) that those airports serve and multiplying the mean duration (t) from exposure to detection. Thus, p = Dt / M. We set t at 10 days according to (Imai et al., 2020) . We assumed that the catchment population is the total population of Iran. We calculated the maximum likelihood estimates of the total number of COVID-19 cases in Iran (\u03bb) by fitting model to the number of confirmed cases with Binomial-distributed likelihood framework. As shown in Eqn (1),\n\nrepresents the total log-likelihood and k is the total number of countries we selected.\n\nThe 95% confidence intervals (CI) are calculated by using the profile likelihood estimation approach determined by a Chi-square quantile.\n\nTo explore more alternative scenarios, we also considered a smaller catchment population (60,000,000) and a shorter detection window (8 days). We considered a baseline scenario with 100% attendance rate for each aircraft as well as other alternative scenarios. In addition, we tested the situation that 90% and 70%\n\nattendance rate for each aircraft, keeping other situation as baseline scenario.\n\nWe estimated the total number of cases in Iran was 16533 (95% CI: 5925, 35538) by 25 February 2020. \n\nThe ethical approval or individual consent was not applicable.\n\nAll data and materials used in this work were publicly available.\n\nNot applicable.\n\n.
