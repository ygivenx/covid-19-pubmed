{"title": "Web Material Assessing Zika Virus Transmission Within Households During an Outbreak in Martinique, 2015-2016", "body": "We developed a model for Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission within households and in the community to jointly analyze three different datasets documenting ZIKV spread in Martinique: 1-follow-up of symptoms among members of households with a confirmed ZIKV case; 2-a seroprevalence survey among blood donors in March and June 2016 (1); and 3-laboratory results in pregnant women presenting with ZIKVrelated symptoms.\n\nWe used a final-size model for disease transmission in households, derived from a classical chain binomial model (2, 3) . The model was expanded to account for the fact that households included in the study all had at least one symptomatic confirmed index ZIKV case, that symptoms may not be due to ZIKV infection and that some ZIKV infections remain asymptomatic.\n\nWe denote the size of the household, the number of persons within the household reporting Zika-like symptoms, the number of ZIKV infections in the household (unobserved) and the number of asymptomatic ZIKV infections (unobserved).\n\nWe denote the probability an individual is infected by ZIKV from the community during the course of the epidemic. The probability of within household transmission, i.e. transmission from one household member to another mediated by a mosquito, is denoted and is a function of household size N.\n\nThe basic chain binomial model provides the probability ( | , , ) to observe Z ZIKV infections in a household of size N, which is determined by a recursive system (2,3) \n\nWe denote the proportion of ZIKV infections that are asymptomatic. The probability to obtain asymptomatic ZIKV infections among ZIKV infections is a binomial draw with parameters and\n\nAll households included in the study had at least one laboratory confirmed symptomatic Zika case. This study design induces a selection bias, as the probability for a household to be recruited depends on the number of members with a symptomatic ZIKV infection. This bias can be addressed by conditioning inference on the fact that the household was recruited.\n\nDenote the probability that a symptomatic Zika case is detected and invited to participate in the study.\n\nThe probability for a household with Z-A symptomatic Zika cases to be recruited is\n\nThis last approximation holds as is expected to be low (68 index cases were invited to participate in the study which compares to an estimate of around 190,000 ZIKV infections in the island (4)).\n\nDenote the probability to be symptomatic for a cause different than ZIKV infection. Given the total number of ZIKV infections ( ) and the number of asymptomatic ZIKV infections ( ), the probability to observe a total of household members presenting with ZIKV-like symptoms is the probability that \u2212 ( \u2212 ) presented with symptoms not related to ZIKV, among the \u2212 ( \u2212 ) members who do not presented with symptoms related to ZIKV. This probability is\n\nHousehold contribution to the likelihood Let = ( , , , , ) be the set of parameters introduced above.\n\nFor each household, the contribution to the likelihood is\n\nwith \u2022 the distribution of household sizes in Martinique (5) . As the distribution is only given in a truncated form (households with 6 members or more, representing 2% of the total number of households in Martinique, were grouped together), we split this bin uniformly in sizes of 6, 7 and 8. We performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of this assumption on our results (Web Appendix 5).\n\nwith N max the maximum household size, and ( , , , | , ) that can be expressed according to the previously introduced probabilities:\n\nDue to the approximation made in (3), appears in both the numerator and denominator and therefore cancels out. (6)). Under the assumption that the (unobserved) weekly number of ZIKV infections was proportional to the (observed) weekly number of consultations for ZIKV-related symptoms, the proportion of the population infected by week Wi is expected to be equal to .\n\nDenoting and the number of blood donors tested and the number of seropositive blood donors in seroprevalence study i, the likelihood for the serological data is\n\nIn practice, we expressed according to our chain binomial model as\n\nWe checked that the seroprevalence studies of March and June led to similar estimates of the overall seroprevalence when considered independently. Applying our approach independently to each time point, the final attack rates of the ZIKV epidemic in Martinique was estimated at 45% (95% CI: 35%, 56%)\n\nbased on the first seroprevalence study and at 55% (95% CI: 46%, 65%) based on the second seroprevalence study. There was no statistical difference between the two estimates (p=0.17). We therefore combined the two studies to improve accuracy.\n\nWe also included the lab results for pregnant women presenting with ZIKV-related symptoms in Martinique between February and November 2016 in the likelihood. Let be the number of women with symptoms and the number of women with a confirmed ZIKV infection among them. The contribution to the likelihood of this study is\n\nwhere | is the probability of being infected by ZIKV given presence of symptoms. This can be expressed as a function of the model parameters (which depends on and ), and\n\nThe final likelihood of the model is\n\nwith \u2131 the set of households, the size of the household and the number of persons with symptoms.\n\nWe estimated the parameters = ( , , , ) using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling (7) with uniform priors on [0,1]. We used log-normal proposal, which were tuned to have an optimal acceptance rate of 24% (8) . We used a chain of 100,000 iterations thinned by a factor 10 and removed the first 1,000 iterations as burn-in. Posterior distributions are presented in Web Figure 1 , meanwhile Web Figure 2 present the trace plots and show a good chain mixing.\n\nTo simulate the 500 datasets used to evaluate the model and the inferential approach, we set the value of at 0.0006 to obtain a mean sample size of approximatively 68.\n\nThe expected and observed distributions of households by size and case count are given in Web Table 5 .\n\nExpected and observed distributions are close to each other, and the observed value always fall in the 95% confidence interval except for households of size 4 with 1 member reporting Zika-like symptoms and for households of size 4 with 3 members reporting Zika-like symptoms. These small discrepancies can be\n\nimputed to the small sample size.\n\nWhen we estimated model parameters for the 500 simulated datasets, we obtained the posterior distributions given in Web Figure 3 . The parameters estimated were consistent with those used to simulate the samples, and the input value fell in 96.6% of the simulations within the credibility interval (Web Table 6 ).\n\nIn the household transmission study, recruitment of households occurred between December 2015 and\n\nOctober 2016. However, the study documenting ZIKV infections in pregnant women started later, in February 2016. In a sensitivity analysis (SA1), we assessed how our estimates were modified if the analysis was restricted to this shorter time period. Results are presented in Web Table 7 .\n\n.\n\nIn existing demographic data (5), households with 6 members or more, that represent 2% of the total number of households in Martinique, are grouped together. In our analyses, we have distributed uniformly these households in sizes of 6, 7 and 8 (see Web Table 1 ). To assess the impact of this assumption on our results, we also considered a scenario where we modeled it with the tail of a geometric distribution (sensitivity analysis SA2), see Web Table 2 .\n\nResults were similar to those obtained in the main analysis (see Web Table 8 ).\n\nThe follow-up of 11% of households stopped before the end of the epidemic. To assess the impact of this incomplete follow-up on the results, we performed a sensitivity analysis by expressing for each household \u210e a specific probability of infection during the epidemic (\u210e) = . (\u210e), with the final probability to have been infected by ZIKV from the community with a complete follow-up (as before), and (\u210e) the proportion of cases in the epidemic curve with onset before the end of the follow-up of household h . We obtained very similar results to the main analysis (see Web Table 9 ).\n\nIn our main analysis, we assumed that is independent of household size (frequency-independent probability of within household transmission). However, frequency-dependent relationship, i.e. a transmission probability depending on the household size, has been found in a number of transmission studies looking at respiratory and vector-borne diseases (9) (10) (11) . In the sensitivity analysis SA3, we used a probability of within household transmission of the form Household with complete follow-up (inclusion, day 10, day 21, week 12 or after) "}
