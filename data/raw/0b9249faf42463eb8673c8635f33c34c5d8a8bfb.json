{"title": "The role of C/EBP\u03b2 phosphorylation in modulating membrane phospholipids repairing in LPS-induced human lung/bronchial epithelial cells", "body": "ALI/ARDS is a common critical emergency in clinical practice (Xiong et al., 2016) and has become a major issue in public health due to outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bird flu. vascular leakage syndrome induced by increased microvascular permeability. The integrity of the cellular membrane is essential for maintaining the vital activities of cells (Lucas et al., 2009) . The physiological function of damaged membranes can be recovered by repair, regeneration or reshaping. Phospholipids are the main component of cell membranes, and their degradation marks the start of cellular damage (De Luca et al., 2012; Elder et al., 2012) . PLA2, a phospholipase highly expressed on cellular membranes, catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2 position of membrane glycerophospholipids to release lysolecithin, platelet activating factor (PAF) and arachidonic acid (AA), which process is a key link to induce lung injury (Kitsiouli et al., 2009; Shiyu et al., 2011) . CCSP is a major secretion of pulmonary clara cells, the nonciliated epithelial cells coving distal bronchiole (Jorens et al., 1995) . As an endogenous PLA2 inhibitor, CCSP1 has potent immune inhibition and anti-inflammation activity (Rastogi and McHowat, 2009 ) and can increase self-defense of the membrane phospholipids (Magrioti and Kokotos, 2010) . CCSP1 reduces the production of lysolecithin, blocks the abnormal deposition of integrins in fibroblasts, and inhibits the release of AA derivatives as inflammatory mediators, the chemotactic response of fibroblasts to PAF, and the production and action of multiple inflammatory mediators (Wong et al., 2009 ). In our initial study stage, we found that the mRNA and protein of CCSP1 were reduced in the in vitro ALI model, BEAS-2B cells exposed to LPS (Shiyu et al., 2011) . Up-regulation of CCSP1 can therefore stabilize membrane phospholipids and maintain normal cellular function in response to external factors, particularly endotoxin, by inhibiting PLA2 activity and thus preventing lung injury.\n\nC/EBPs, a type of transcriptional regulation factor, were identified by Graves in 1987 (Zahnow, 2009 ). The C/EBP family of transcriptional regulation factors includes at least six members: C/EBP\u03b1, -\u03b2, -\u03b3, -\u03b4, -\u03b5 and -\u03b6. C/EBP proves to be closely associated with ALI (Okuma et al., 2015) . Sugahara et al. demonstrated that C/EBP promotes the proliferation of alveolar endothelial cells in ALI (Sugahara et al., 1999) . Therefore, we think that the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 plays a crucial role in the regulation of LPS-induced cellular membrane damage in BEAS-2B cells. The major purposes of the study is to verify that (1) phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 increases the activity of the transcription factor;\n\n(2) C/EBP \u03b2 can bind to the promoter of CCSP1 gene and positively regulates its transcription; (3) C/EBP \u03b2 regulates the expression of PLA2 protein through CCSP1 transcription and thus affects LPS-induced membrane damage; i.e., there is a C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway which regulates the cellular membrane damage in the ALI model.\n\nDepartment, Second Military Medical University of China) are human normal lung/bronchial epithelia cells transformed by the SV40 T-antigen. BEAS-2B cells were cultured in LHC-8 medium (Invitrogen, CA, USA). Virus producing cell line 293 T (Systermbio, CA, USA) maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS were used for lentiviral packaging, in the luciferase reporter experiments, 293 T were used as a tool cell line. All these adherent cells were passaged by 0.25% trypsin digestion (Invitrogen) and incubated in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 at 37\u00b0C.\n\nThe CDS of human C/EBP \u03b2 (NM_005194.3) was amplified using the primers 5\u2032-GCTCTAGAGCCACCATGCAACGCCTGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CGGGATCCCTAGCAGT GGCCGGAGGA-3\u2032, which contain an XbaI restriction site(5\u2032-TCTAGA-3\u2032) and Kozaksequence(5\u2032-CCACC-3\u2032) and a BamHI restriction site(5\u2032-GATCC-3\u2032), respectively, and cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of RNA isolated from BEAS-2B cells. The PCR product was digested and cloned into the pcDH1-CMV expression vector (Systermbio); the recombinant vector was named pcDH1-C/EBP \u03b2. The expression vector for human CDK2 (NM_001798.4) pcDH1-CDK2 and the expression vector for the CCSP1 gene (NM_003357.4) pcDH1-CCSP1 were similarly constructed using the primers 5\u2032-GCTCTAGAGCCACCATGGAGAACTTCCAA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CGGGATCC TCAGAGTCGAAG ATGGGGTA-3\u2032 for CDK2 and 5\u2032-GCTCTAGAGCCACCATGGGAGCTGCTG GGA-3\u2032and 5\u2032-ATAAGAATG CGGCCGCTCACAACTTCTTCTTC-3\u2032 for CCSP1.\n\nAn siRNA sequence targeting the CDS of C/EBP \u03b2 was designed, and corresponding DNA hairpin structure (5\u2032-GATCCGAG CAAGGCCAAGAAGACCCTTCCTGTCAGAGGTCTTCTTGGCCTTGCTC TTTTTG-3\u2032) sequences were synthesized, annealed and cloned into the pshRNA-H1 expression vector (Systermbio); the resulting vector was named pshRNA-C/EBP \u03b2. The shRNA expression vectors targeting CCSP1 and CDK2, pshRNA-CCSP1 and pshRNA-CDK2, which contained the sequences 5\u2032-GGAGCTTAACCATCCTAAT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGAGCTTAACCATCCTAAT-3\u2032, respectively, and the control vector pshRNA-NC (Negative Control), which contained the sequence 5\u2032-GTGACGAGCGAGTCAAGAT-3\u2032, were constructed in a similar manner.\n\nNext, we extracted human genomic DNA from BEAS-2B cells by QIAamp DNA Mini Kit(QIAGEN, Germany) and amplified the promoter of CCSP1 using the primers 5\u2032-GACTAGTAGGCCAGGTT AGGTGCTATGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GACTAGTGTGAGGGTGACAGCGA GTTTCAT-3\u2032, which each contain a SpeI restriction site(5\u2032-GACTAGT-3\u2032). The PCR product was digested and cloned into the pcDH1-CCSP1 expression vector to replace the CMV promoter; the recombinant vector was named pcDH1-wPro-CCSP1 (wPro means vector with wild type CCSP1 promoter). Bioinformatics analysis (TRANSFAC) revealed a potential C/EBP \u03b2 binding site, 5\u2032-CTTGAGAAAA-3\u2032, in the CCSP1 promoter. We mutated the sequence to 5\u2032-CTTGCGGAAG-3\u2032 to generate a CCSP1 expression vector carrying a mutant promoter, pcDH1-mPro-CCSP1 (mPro means vector with wild mutant CCSP1 promoter).\n\nThe promoters were amplified by using pcDH1-wPro-CCSP1 and pcDH1-mPro-CCSP1 plasmids as template, and cloned to a luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-Enkancer (Promega, WI, USA), to construct the wild-type and mutant-type reporter vectors, pGL3-wPro-CCSP1 and pGL3-mPro-CCSP1. The PCR primers used are: forward, 5\u2032-GGGTACCAGGCCAGGTTAGGTGCTATGA-3\u2032 and backward, 5\u2032-CCAAGCTTGTGAGGGTGACAGCGAGTTTCAT-3\u2032, including KpnI (5\u2032-GGGTACC-3\u2032) and HidIII (5\u2032-CCCAAGCTT-3\u2032) digestion sites and protective bases.\n\nThe sequence-validated recombinant vectors were amplified in bacteria, and endotoxin-free DNA was prepared by EndoFree Plasmid Mini Kit (Qiagen). The expression vector or shRNA vector and Lentivirus Package plasmids mix(Systermbio) were co-transfected into 293 T producer cells using Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 (Invitrogen)as instructed by the manufacturer. After 48 h, the supernatants were collected, centrifuged and filtered using 0.45-\u03bcm polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, MI, USA). The viral titer was evaluated by gradient dilution. The packaged lentiviruses were named Lv-CDK2, Lv-C/EBP \u03b2, Lv-CCSP1, Lv-wPro-CCSP1, Lv-mPro-CCSP1, Lv-shRNA-C/ EBP \u03b2, Lv-shRNA-CCSP1, Lv-shRNA-CDK2 and Lv-NC.\n\nTo examine the gene delivery efficiency and gene intervention effect of the recombinant viruses, we infected BEAS-2B cells with the overexpression and silencing viruses of CDK2, C/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1. The cells were divided into five groups: BEASe2B, BEAS-2B + Lv-Control, BEAS-2B + Lv-CDK2, BEAS-2B + Lv-NC and BEAS-2B + Lv-shRNA-CDK2; the grouping for C/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 gene intervention was similar. One day before viral infection, BEAS-2B cells in logarithmic phase were made into suspension by trypsin digestion, and the number of viable cells was counted by using trypan blue staining. Cells were collected by 1000 \u00d7 g centrifugation and re-suspended in LHC-8 medium to a concentration of 5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/ml. Cells were seeded on 6-well plates, 2 ml/well, and cultured overnight under normal conditions. One day after seeding, BEAS-2B cells were infected with lentiviruses diluted by LHC-8 at a MOI of 10, and the medium was refreshed after 24 h. The infection efficiency was assessed by fluorescence microscopy 72 h after infection. Total protein were extracted from the cells by a M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent Kit (Thermo, USA) and subjected to western blotting to measure the levels of CDK2, C/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1.\n\nWe developed an in vitro ALI model using LPS to induce BEAS-2B cells. Suspension of BEAS-2B cells in logarithmic phase was prepared by trypsin digestion, and the number of viable cells was counted with a hemocytometer by trypan blue staining. Cells were suspended in LHC-8 medium and seeded to 6-well plates at 2 \u00d7 10 5 /well and cultured for 16 h and then the medium was replaced with the LHC-8 medium. 8 h after the medium replacement, LPS was added to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml, and the cells were cultured for 12, 24 or 48 h more. Cells were collected and total protein was extracted and quantified by the method of BCA; intracellular inflammatory factors such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and 1 L-10, as well as PAF and AA, were measured by ELISA, which were used to determine whether the model was established. We then assessed the expression of CDK2, CCSP1 and PLA2, and phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 in the cells by western blotting.\n\nSince it is reported that overexpression of CDK2 can regulate the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 (Li et al., 2007) , we overexpressed and knocked down CDK2 via a lentiviral approach in BEAS-2B cells and examined the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2. At the same time, we predicted C/EBP \u03b2 as a regulator of CCSP1 transcription, so we also overexpressed and silenced CCSP1 in BEAS-2B cells, and observed the effect on the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2. BEAS-2B cells in logarithmic phase were seeded to 6-well plates and recombinant viral solution was added at an MOI of 10. 72 h later, cells were collected and total protein was isolated and subjected to western blotting for measuring the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2. The cells were divided into five groups: cell control, the cells infected with Lv-NC, Lv-CDK2, Lv-shRNA-CDK2, Lv-CCSP1, or Lv-shRNA-CCSP1.\n\nAccording to bioinformatics, we found a possible binding site of C/ EBP \u03b2 in CCSP1 promoter, 5\u2032-CTTGAGAAAA-3\u2032. We overexpressed Lv-wPro-CCSP1 or Lv-mPro-CCSP1 in BEAS-2B cells and then overexpressed or silenced CDK2 to find out the effects of overexpression and depletion of CDK2 and C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation on the mRNA level of CCSP1. By measuring CCSP1 transcription, we wanted to figure out the effect of C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation on CCSP1 transcription and whether C/EBP \u03b2 binds to CCSP1 promoter through the predicted site. The cells were divided into nine groups: cell control, cells infected with Lv-wPro-\n\n, Lv-wPro-CCSP1 + Lv-shRNA-CDK2, and Lv-mPro-CCSP1 + Lv-shRNA-CDK2. The infection condition was the same as described above, and mRNA quantification was performed 72 h after infection.\n\nTo verify the binding site of C/EBP \u03b2 in CCSP1 promoter, we conducted CHIP-PCR experiment. BEAS-2B cells in logarithmic phase were infected with Lv-wPro-CCSP1 or Lv-mPro-CCSP1 and then infected with Lv-C/EBP \u03b2. 72 h later, cells were harvested and subjected to CHIP-PCR in accordance with the instruction of EZ CHIP KIT (Millipore, MI,USA),The experiment were carried out with reference (Yang et al., 2013) and in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The primers for real-time quantitative PCR were: 5\u2032-TTGTGTGAGCTCAGTTTCAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCTTGGTGGGATAGGTAA-3\u2032, producing a product of 72 bp, carrying the predicted C/EBP \u03b2 binding site \"5\u2032-CTTGAGAAAA-3\u2032\".\n\nTo eliminate the interference of endogenous CCSP1 promoter on CHIP-PCR, we also performed luciferase reporter assays. 293 cells were transfected with pcDH1-C/EBP \u03b2 and pGL3-wPro-CCSP1 or pGL3-mPro-CCSP1, and harvested for luciferase activity assay 48 h later. The transfection experiment was carried out in 24-well plates, following the instructions for Lipofectmaine2000. PGL-TK (100 ng) was transfected for each well as the internal reference for luciferase assay.\n\nTo verify the specificity of the C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway, we knocked down C/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 respectively, and overexpressed CDK2 in the in vitro ALI model established by LPS induction to observe the effect on the inhibition of PLA2 by CDK2 and analyze the specificity of the pathway. The infection condition and LPS induction condition were the same as described above; 48 h after infection, LPS induction was carried out. 24 h after LPS treatment, cells were harvested and total protein was isolated for western blotting for measuring PLA2.\n\n2.9. Examination of effect of C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation on damage of phospholipid membrane in in vitro ALI model\n\nThe cells were treated as in the experiment for verifying pathway specificity: LPS induction started 48 h after infection, and 24 h after induction, cells were collected and subjected to PAF and AA assessment. The inter-group difference of PAF and AA releases was used to determine the damage degree of membrane phospholipid.\n\nAfter removal of the culture medium, the cells were washed with pre-cooled dPBS, supplemented with pre-cooled trizol reagent, and pipetted until the lysate became viscous and clear. The lysate was transferred to a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube and extracted using the phenolchloroform method (Han et al., 2002) . The purity of the total RNA was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry, and the mRNA levels of CCSP1 were detected by real-time PCR. Total RNA (2 \u03bcg) was used as the template to prepare cDNA by reverse transcription. The product of reverse transcription (2 \u03bcl) was used as the template for real-time PCR. The results were analyzed using the2 \u0394\u0394Ct method with \u03b2-actin (NM_001101.3) as the internal reference (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001) . The PCR primers were as follows: \u03b2 actin-forward,5\u2032-CCTGTACGCCA-ACACAGTGC-3\u2032, \u03b2 actin-reverse,5\u2032-ATACTCCTGCTT GCTGATCC-3\u2032; C-CSP1-forward,5\u2032-GCCGGCGCCCGAGCTCTGGCTC-3\u2032;CCSP1-reverse, 5\u2032-TGTCAGTTTGTCAAATACCCCA-3.Each PCR reaction contained 10 \u03bcl of SYBR Premix Ex Taq, 0.2 \u03bcl each of forward and reverse primers (20 \u03bcM), 2 \u03bcl of cDNA, and dH 2 O to a final volume of 20 \u03bcl. The reaction parameters were 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 s, annealing at 58\u00b0C for 10 s, and elongation at 72\u00b0C for 10 s. The experiment was carried out on Takara fluorescent quantitative TP800.\n\nTotal protein was extracted, and proteins were detected by western blotting. Cells were rinsed with 1 ml of cooled dPBS, and 1 ml of cell lysis buffer (50 mM pH 8.0 Tris, 1 mg/ml leupeptin,150 mMNaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mM EDTA, 100 mMphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 M dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml aprotinin) was added for protein extraction. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. Protein samples (10 \u03bcl/lane) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes by wet transfer. Blots were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (TBST) containing 5% nonfat milk at room temperature for 2 h and incubated with primary antibodies (anti-CDK2(sc-6248, santacruz),1:300;anti-CCSP1(07-623,millipore),1:500; anti-PLA2(sc-58,363,santacruz),1:500; anti-\u03b2 actin(sc-130,301,santacruz),1:800; anti-C/EBP \u03b2(ab32358,Abcam),1:400;anti-phosphorylation-C/EBP \u03b2(ab52194,Abcam),1:400) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The membranes were then rinsed with TBST and incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 h. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) substrates (Pierce, CA,USA) and Xray film were used to detect the bands, and the relative optical densities were analyzed using image processing software (Daniels et al., 2017) .\n\nTotal protein was extracted and quantified using the BCA method, and intracellular TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10 were measured using Human TNF\u03b1-ELISA kit, Human IL-1\u03b2-ELISA kit and Human IL-10 ELISA kit (Invitrogen).Experiments for the PAF and AA level were performed using the Human arachidonic acid (AA) ELISA Kit (MBS703581, Cayman) and Human Platelet Activating Factor (PAF) ELISA Kit (MBS701223) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After the experiments, the value data of PAF and AA were calculated according to the A450.\n\nAll data is expressed as mean \u00b1 SD, and analyzed by one way ANOVA. Least Significant Difference (LSD) was used for multiple comparisons between any two means. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 software.\n\nHighly efficient gene delivery is essential for effective interference. We resolved the difficulty of transfecting BEAS-2B cells by using routine approaches with a lentiviral system (Fig. 1A) , resulting in GFP expression in more than 90% of cells. The lentiviral approach produced good results for overexpression and knockdown of CDK2, C/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 in BEAS-2B cells: western blotting results show that the expression levels of CDK2, C/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 in the overexpression groups were 3.69 \u00b1 0.06, 4.18 \u00b1 0.04 and 3.06 \u00b1 0.07 times as high as that of the control groups respectively (Fig. 1B) , and CDK2, C/ EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 in the knockdown groups were 0.12 \u00b1 0.01, 0.28 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.20 \u00b1 0.01 times as high as that of the control groups respectively (Fig. 1B) , with significant differences between the genetic intervention groups and the cell groups (P < 0.05); no significant differences were observed in CDK2, C/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 expression levels between the Lv-NC or Lv-control groups and the control groups (P > 0.05). These data suggest that the lentiviral approach we used effectively expressed or knocked down CDK2, C/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 genes, and the viral system and hairpin structure themselves had little effect on these genes.\n\nWe employed LPS to induce BEAS-2B cells to develop an in vitro ALI model, and examined TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-10, as well as PAF and AA, in the cells to determine whether the model was established. ELISA results ( Fig. 2A) show that TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-10 were increased in BEAS-2B cells induced with LPS for 12 h, 24 h or 48 h, with significant difference in the three inflammatory factors between the LPS group and the cell group at 24 and 48 h (P < 0.05). Measurements of PAF and AA demonstrate that induction of 10 mg/ml LPS for 12, 24, or 48 h increased PAF and AA, both of which peaked at 48 h. The inflammatory indicators and membrane metabolic indices suggested that BEAS-2B cells displayed an obvious inflammatory response after being induced by 10 mg/ml LPS and released PAF and AA, indicating the successful establishment of the in-vitro ALI model. Based on the model, we assessed CDK2, CCSP1 and PLA2 levels and C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation in the cells (Fig. 2C) , and found the expression of CDK2 and CCSP1 and C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation displayed similar changes-a decrease after treatment of LPS, with significant differences between the LPS treated groups and the cell groups (P < 0.05); PLA2 was increased by LPS treatment, significant difference found at 24 and 48 h (P < 0.05). Analyzing the change of four proteins in different groups, we found that in the ALI model, CDK2, CCSP1 and phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 were decreased, with obvious correlation between each other. In addition, the expression of PLA2 was significantly increased in the ALI model, which was negatively correlated with the expression of CDK2 and CCSP1, and the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2.These findings hinted that the increase in the expression of CDK2, and CCSP1, and the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2, and the decrease in PLA2 may have a positive impact on ALI.\n\nXi Le et al. reported that CDK2 can phosphorylate C/EBP \u03b2 through Thr188 (Xi Li et al., 2007) , so in the study, we used CDK2 to regulate the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 by overexpressing and knocking down CDK2 in BEAS-2B cells. At the same time, we also overexpressed and depleted CCSP1 to observe the effect on C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation, which would help us to ascertain the relation between C/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1. The results (Fig. 3) indicate that CDK2 overexpression increased both C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation and C-CSP1 expression (P < 0.05 vs cell control) while CDK2 knockdown suppressed both C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation and CCSP1 expression (P < 0.05 vs cell control). For C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation or CCSP1 expression, there was no significant difference between the Lv-NC group and the control group (P > 0.05). In addition, the overexpression and silencing of CCSP1 had no obvious effect on the expression of CDK2 or the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 (P > 0.05 vs cell control). Based on the analysis of these data, we speculated that CDK2 is an upstream mediator of C/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 is a downstream element of C/EBP \u03b2. The regulation of C/EBP \u03b2 by CDK2 has been reported, but is it possible for C/EBP \u03b2 to regulate the expression of C-CSP1? We next investigated the problem by using subsequent experiments.\n\nAccording to the prediction of bioinformatics, we constructed a recombinant lentivirus with the wild CCSP1 promoter, Lv-wPro-CCSP1, and a lentivirus carrying a mutant CCSP1 promoter, Lv-mPro-CCSP1. We infected BEAS-2B cells with these lentiviruses and overexpressed CDK2, and then qualified CCSP1 mRNA to verify the predicted binding site of C/EBP \u03b2. The results (Fig. 4A) show that infection of Lv-wPro-CCSP1 or Lv-mPro-CCSP1 increased CCSP1 mRNA (P < 0.05 vs control). In comparison with infection of Lv-wPro-CCSP1 alone, co-infection with Lv-CDK2 increased CCSP1 mRNA, and co-infection with Lv-shRNA-CDK2 impaired the increase (P < 0.05). The co-infection with Lv-CDK2 or Lv-shRNA-CDK2 did not change CCSP1 mRNA in the cells infected with Lv-mPro-CCSP1 (P > 0.05). All these data suggest that C/EBP \u03b2 regulates the transcription of CCSP1 through the predicted binding site. We further verified the binding by using CHIP-PCR (Fig. 4B ). In the BEAS-2B cells infected with Lv-wPro-CCSP1, C/EBP \u03b2 bound to more DNA fragments around the binding site in CCSP1 promoter (P < 0.05 vs Lv-control), and in the cells infected with Lv-mPro-CCSP1, no difference was observed (P > 0.05). The luciferase activity assay data (Fig. 4C ) demonstrated that the luciferase activity in the groups transfected with pcDH1-C/EBP \u03b2 alone or pshRNA-C/EBP \u03b2 and pGL3-wPro-CCSP1 was significantly higher or lower than in the group transfected with pGL3-wPro-CCSP1 alone (P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference in luciferase activity between the group transfected with pcDH1-C/EBP \u03b2, or pshRNA-C/EBP \u03b2 and pGL3-mPro-CCSP1, and the group transfected with pGL3-mPro-CCSP1 alone (P > 0.05). No difference was observed in the groups transfected with pshRNA-NC with pGL3-wPro-CCSP1 or pGL3-mPro-CCSP1, compared with the groups transfected with pGL3-wPro-CCSP1 or pGL3-mPro-CCSP1 alone (P > 0.05).\n\nTo verify the critical role of C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation in the C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway and the specificity of the pathway, we overexpressed CDK2 in the in vitro ALI model to phosphorylate C/EBP \u03b2 and then observed the change in PLA2; In addition, we also knocked down C/EBP \u03b2 or CCSP1 in the ALI model with CDK2 overexpression and examined PLA2 protein levels in these groups. The results (Fig. 5A) show that CDK2 overexpression attenuated LPS-induced increase of PLA2 protein (P < 0.05 vs LPS group), indicating that overexpression of CDK2, or C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation, could significantly inhibit PLA2 expression in the in vitro ALI model. Knockdown of C/EBP \u03b2 or CCSP1 impaired the inhibition of PLA2 expression by CDK2 overexpression (P < 0.05 vs LPS + Lv-CDK2), indicating in the in vitro ALI model, there was a specific C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway. To illustrate the effect of C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation on membrane phospholipid damage in the in vitro ALI model, we treated BEAS-2B cells which overexpressed or were depleted with CDK2 with LPS for 48 h and assessed PAF and AA by ELISA. The data (Fig. 5B) show that CDK2 overexpression inhibited the release of PAF and AA induced by LPS (P < 0.05), while the contents of PAF and AA in the group of CDK silencing and LPS induction were slightly higher than that in the LPS group (P > 0.05). No change in PAF or AA was found in the Lv-NC group (P > 0.05 vs LPS group). In conclusion, we believe that the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 can promote the transcription of CCSP1 and subsequently inhibit the expression of PLA2 and then resist the disruption of phospholipids caused by ALI.\n\nC/EBP family members have a basic DNA-binding domain and a leucine zipper domain, which bind to the enhancer 5\u2032-RTTGCGYAAY-3 (\u2032R = A or G, Y]C or T) or variants to positively or negatively regulate transcription, thus playing important roles in energy metabolism, cell growth, differentiation and tumorigenesis, hematogenesis and the immune response (Sayeed et al., 2015; Shimizu et al., 2015) . C/EBP \u03b2 expression varies in porcine liver during prenatal and postnatal development and sharply increases after birth, according to Tang et al. (Tang et al., 2015) . C/EBP \u03b2 can activate the transcription of the IGF1 gene by A. TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-10 in BEAS-2B cells were examined using ELISA 12 h, 24 h or 48 h after treatment of 10 mg/ml LPS.

ATP-dependent P2X7 receptor activation is also dependent on the transcriptional regulation of C/EBP \u03b2 (Bilodeau et al., 2015) . The above studies clearly indicate that C/EBP \u03b2 mainly plays its transcriptional regulatory role as a nuclear transcription factor.\n\nCassel et al. identified two binding sites for C/EBP\u03b1 and C/EBP\u03b4 in the sequence between \u2212 100 bp and \u221262 bp of the CCSP promoter through which C/EBP\u03b4 and C/EBP\u03b1 enhance CCSP expression via a complex response element in A549 cells which are adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (Cassel et al., 2000) . Massaad et al. (Massaad et al., 2000) suggested that IL-1\u03b2 can enhance the transcription of PLA2 through the promoter (\u2212 1614:+20 nt) by 6-7-fold, and the region (\u2212 210:\u2212176 nt) is crucial to the process. C/EBP \u03b2 and C/EBP\u03b4 can bind to this region, indicating that C/EBP may block IL-1\u03b2induced PLA2 transcription. These studies may suggest that there are some potential relationships between C/EBP and CCSP/PLA2; however, the specific pathway remains unclear.\n\nThe transcriptional activity of C/EBP \u03b2 depends on its phosphorylation: phosphorylation of specific amino acids allows the protein to be translocated into the nucleus and bind to the promoter of genes regulated by it, so as to regulate the transcription of downstream genes (Zhou et al., 2015) .Therefore, our research objectives are to prevent the damage of membrane by effective intervention in the in vitro ALI model through the C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway based on C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation. If C/EBP \u03b2 inhibits PLA2 by upregulating CCSP1, we may seek an approach to repair membrane phospholipids damaged by acute inflammation based on the C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway. Having confirmed the existence of the C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP/PLA2 pathway, we attempted to suppress the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 to inhibit the pathway and reduce the LPS-induced breakdown of membrane phospholipids.\n\nOur data show that in an in vitro ALI model established by LPS induction, phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 was decreased and bioinformatics analysis discovered a putative binding site of C/EBP \u03b2 in CCSP1 promoter, so we wondered whether C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation regulates the transcription of CCSP1. We, using CHIP-PCR and luciferase reporter assay, demonstrated that C/EBP \u03b2 binds to CCSP1 promoter and positively regulates CCSP1 transcription, and its phosphorylation increases its transcriptional activity. Based on the validation of the specificity of C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP/PLA2 pathway, we overexpressed CDK2 to enhance the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 on Thr188 (Li et al., 2007) , so as to inhibit the expression of PLA2 via the C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP/PLA2 pathway, and to control LPS-induced cellular membrane injury. The findings corroborate that overexpression of CDK2 inhibited the production of PAF and AA in the ALI model, i.e., overexpression of CDK2 attenuated the damage of membrane phospholipids. The study sheds light on the underlying signal transduction for repair of membrane phospholipids and provides a novel target for treatment of ALI.\n\nWe employed LPS to induce BEAS-2B cells, and found out the optimal condition for building the in vitro ALI model, 10 mg/ml LPS induction for 24 h by examining TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10 expression levels and the release of PAF and AA. Based on the model, we assessed CDK2, Fig. 3 . Overexpression and knockdown of CDK2 and CCSP1 and their effects on C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation. BEAS-2B cells were infected with the indicated lentivirus, and CDK2, CCSP1 and phosphorylated C/EBP \u03b2 and total C/EBP \u03b2 were measured by western blotting 72 h later.

CCSP1 and PLA2 protein levels, and the results revealed that in the model, CDK2 and CCSP1 were decreased, and PLA2 was increased. In addition, measurement of protein phosphorylation showed that LPS induction significantly suppressed C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation. To verify the existence of C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway, we analyzed the relation between C/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 gene. The experiment revealed that C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation or dephosphorylation could enhance or suppress CCSP1 transcription but overexpression or knockdown of CCSP1 had no effect on C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation, hinting at CCSP1 being downstream C/EBP \u03b2. We next employed co-infection and CHIP-PCR to verify the binding site of C/EBP \u03b2 in CCSP1 promoter predicted by bioinformatics. Quantitative determination of CCSP1 mRNA shows that C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation enhanced CCSP1 transcription controlled by the wild promoter but not that controlled by the promoter with binding site mutation, and dephosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 only inhibited CCSP1 transcription controlled by the wild promoter. CHIP-PCR results show that C/EBP \u03b2 was capable of binding to the promoter DNA carrying the wild binding site but not the one carrying mutant binding site. However, though endogenous CCSP1 promoter is at a low level in CHIP-PCR experiments, it may have a certain inference on the experimental data. Therefore, we employed the luciferase reporter assay to verify the results of CHIP-PCR. The results indicated that overexpression of C/EBP \u03b2 significantly increased the luciferase controlled by wild type CCSP1 promoter, but had no obvious effect on that controlled by the CCSP1 promoter with a mutant binding site. Eliminating the background impact, these data demonstrated that the transcription factor can bind to CCSP1 promoter through the predicted site and activate the transcription.\n\nThese results clarified the regulatory sequence of the proteins in the C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway. In addition, we also investigated the specificity of the C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway by knocking down C/ EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1, and the results indicate that the inhibition of PLA2 by CDK2 was mediated by C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation and transcription of CCSP1. LPS stimulation inhibits the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 in BEAS-2B cells, suppresses the C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway, and increases the expression of PLA2 protein, leading to membrane injury. Since CCSP1 is an endogenous inhibitor of PLA2, we tried to inhibit the damage of membrane in the in vitro ALI model through regulating PLA2 via C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation. To regulate phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2, we overexpressed or silenced its upstream kinase CDK2, which is proved to be an effective means to phosphorylate or dephosphorylate C/EBP \u03b2 by the experimental data. The findings suggest that overexpression of CDK2 suppressed LPS-induced increase of PLA2 in the cells via the C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway, and inhibited the release of PAF and AA, a clear inhibition of membrane phospholipid damage in the in vitro ALI model. These findings are promising, since it is of significance to the treatment of ALI that increase of C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation could inhibit PLA2 expression and membrane injury in ALI. The results indicate that C/EBP \u03b2 is a potential target for ALI treatment. However, we also have some urgent work for the future. For example, what is the mechanism by which LPS stimulation inhibits the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2, and is there some approach that regulates the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 in a more effective, more direct and specific way? The experimental strategy of increasing C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation by CDK2 overexpression is obviously not suitable for clinical application. For this reason, our future research will focus on the development of specific agonist for C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation, which may be used in the ALI treatment.\n\nIn conclusion, our study shows that C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation could impair the increase in PLA2 in the in vitro ALI model through the C/ EBP \u03b2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway and thus restrain the membrane injury caused by PLA2, which is of significance to maintaining normal function of epithelial cells in ALI disease. It is also suggested that C/EBP \u03b2 be a potential target for targeted therapy of ALI and the development of Fig. 5 . Verifying the specificity of the pathway and examining membrane damage A.
