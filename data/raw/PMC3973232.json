{"title": "Methamphetamine induces autophagy as a pro-survival response against apoptotic endothelial cell death through the Kappa opioid receptor", "body": "We initially determined if METH treatment reduced cell viability. The blood concentrations of METH in drug abusers are in the low micromolar range, with a median concentration of 1.25 \u03bcM.10 Therefore, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were exposed to 1 \u03bcM METH for 24, 48 or 72 h and cell viability determined using a MTT assay. Although, no obvious change in viability was observed at 24 and 48 h with low concentration (1 \u03bcM) of METH, significant decrease in viability was observed at 72 h compared with control (Figure 1a).\n\nNext, we evaluated whether 1 \u03bcM METH affected endothelial cell barrier integrity. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) and HUVECs were cultured on ECIS array electrodes, and transendothelial electrical resistance was monitored continuously over the course of 72 h. As shown in Figures 1b and c, no significant decrease in average transendothelial electrical resistance measurements was observed with 1 \u03bcM METH at 24 h but at 72 h, a 50% decrease in resistance was observed compared with control.\n\nInhibition of apoptosis using 50 \u03bcM zVAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor-attenuated METH-induced decrease in electrical resistance at 72 h supporting our hypothesis that METH exposure reduced electrical resistance at late time point due to cell death and autophagy maybe responsible for the early protective effects.\n\nTo further determine if acute METH treatment induces an autophagic pro-survival response, we monitored different autophagy markers: LC3 vesicular recruitment and LAMP1. To analyze autophagosome formation, we used anti-LC3 immunofluorescence in a cell-based detection system with HUVECs. In 1 \u03bcM METH-treated cells, LC3 protein increased in total abundance and was aggregated in vesicular structures (Figure 1d). LC3 (ATG 8) is first cleaved by ATG4 to generate LC3-I and then lipidated to produce LC3-II. LC3-II is incorporated into the inner and outer surfaces of autophagosomes, and as such, remains associated with the autophagosome throughout the pathway. The lipidated (LC3-II) form can be detected as a faster-migrating band in western blots.11, 12 The amount of LC3-II in the presence and absence of saturating levels of inhibitors, which can be used to examine the transit of LC3-II through the autophagic pathway; if autophagy flux is occurring, the levels of LC3-II will be higher in the presence of the inhibitors. Lysosomal degradation can be prevented through the use of protease inhibitors (e.g., pepstatin A and E-64d).13 Our data demonstrate that the LC3-I/LC3-II conversion occurred rapidly, within 6 h, after METH treatment and was still detectable at 24 h post treatment in the presence of the protease inhibitors pepstatin A and E-64d (Figures 1e and f).\n\nWe also examined LAMP1 which is an integral glycoprotein residing in late endosomes and lysosomes.14 HUVECs were transfected with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1-green fluorescent protein (LAMP1-GFP) and then treated with vehicle or METH. In Figure 1g we show increased LAMP1-GFP-labeled vesicles in METH-treated HUVECs after 24 and 48 h, indicating induction of an autophagic response following 1 \u03bcM METH treatment.\n\nBeclin1, a novel Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain-only protein, has an important part in both autophagosome formation and autolysosome fusion. Beclin1 and the class III phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) Vps34 form two distinct complexes. In complex I, which contributes to an autophagosome formation, Atg14L bridges Beclin1 and the Vps34\u2013p150 complex. In complex II, which regulates the vacuolar protein sorting pathway, UV radiation resistance-associated gene product bridges Beclin1 and the Vps34\u2013p150 complex. Bcl-2 family proteins negatively regulate the kinase activity of the Beclin1\u2013Vps34 complex.15, 16 Thus, accumulation of Beclin1 protein can be used as an indicator of autophagy induction. To further confirm METH-induced autophagy, we measured Beclin1 protein level using confocal microscopy. Our results showed an upregulation of Beclin1 in METH-treated HUVECs (Figure 2a).\n\nPrevious studies have shown that formation of a Beclin1/Bcl-2 complex may function as a rheostat that regulates autophagic capacity and ensures that autophagy levels remain within a homeostatic range.17 To determine whether METH treatment affected Beclin1 and Bcl-2 expression, total cellular levels of each protein were analyzed by western blots (Figure 2b). Beclin1 levels increased around sixfold, whereas Bcl-2 levels decreased over the period of METH treatment (Figure 2c). The expression of Beclin1 was induced at 24 and 48 h of exposure, indicating induction of autophagy in METH-treated cells. To address the possibility that METH-modulated Beclin1 expression and the interaction with Bcl-2, Beclin1/Bcl-2 complexes were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against Beclin1. The western blots in Figures 2d and e showed that in control cells Bcl-2 co-immunoprecipitated with Beclin1 which decreased following 24 h of METH treatment. Together, these results suggested that METH-induced autophagy in endothelial cells was mediated by upregulating Beclin1 expression and disrupting the balance between Beclin1 and Bcl-2.\n\nKOR, is highly expressed on HUVECs.18 A growing body of evidence indicate that KOR may be involved in the modulation of abuse-related effects of CNS stimulants.19, 20 Stimulation of KOR decreases acute amphetamine-induced behavior and mRNA expression of neuropeptides in the rat striatum.21 To determine if KOR has a role in METH-induced autophagy, we examined the effects of the KOR antagonist nor-Binaltorphiminedihydrochloride (nor-BNI) pretreatment on inhibition of METH-induced Beclin1 expression. nor-BNI in a concentration-dependent manner inhibited METH-induced Beclin1 mRNA expression at the indicated concentrations of 1, 10 and 20 \u03bcM nor-BNI. A total of 20 \u03bcM nor-BNI significantly inhibited METH-induced Beclin1 mRNA expression compared with METH treatment alone (Figure 3a). Subsequently, 20 \u03bcM nor-BNI was used in the following experiments. Pretreatment with nor-BNI inhibited Beclin1 protein expression (Figures 3b and c). Immunofluoresence experiments further illustrated the downregulation of Beclin1 induced by METH in nor-BNI pretreated HUVECs (Figure 3d).\n\nTo further evaluate METH effects on endothelial cells at the ultrastructural level, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on cells treated with METH. Vehicle treated HUVECs exhibited the normal ultrastructural morphology of cytoplasm, organelles and nuclei (Figure 3e). In contrast, exposure to 1 \u03bcM METH for 24 h revealed double-membrane vacuolar structures (Figure 3eii, Black arrow). Noticeably, pre-incubation with 20 \u03bcM nor-BNI 1 h before METH treatment did not cause significant appearance of double-membrane vacuolar structures, nor did treatment alter the integrity of mitochondria (Figure 3eii, White arrow), implicating the role of KOR in METH-induced autophagy.\n\nTo confirm the specific role of the KOR antagonist nor-BNI in regulating Beclin1 expression, HUVECs were transfected with scramble siRNA or KOR siRNA. KOR and Beclin1 mRNA expression were detected by real-time PCR analysis. As shown in Figure 3f, KOR siRNA dramatically downregulated KOR mRNA level compared with scramble siRNA-transfected cells. We further examined Beclin1 mRNA expression in response to knockdown of KOR in the presence of METH treatment. As shown in Figure 3g, METH-induced Beclin1 mRNA expression was significantly decreased upon knockdown of KOR.\n\nAutophagy is a multi-step process and is highly regulated through the action of various kinases, phosphatases and guanosine triphosphatases(GTPases).22, 23, 24 The following two pathways are known to be important in the regulation of autophagy: (i) The class I phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) signaling pathway; and (ii) the Ras/Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway.25 Therefore, we examined the upstream mediators that are involved in METH-induced autophagy using western blotting. METH treatment showed a sustained increase in the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2, the active form, visible 6 h post treatment (Figures 4a and b). METH-induced ERK phosphorylation was inhibited when cells were pretreated with the KOR antagonist nor-BNI establishing the role of KOR in METH-induced autophagy (Figures 4c and d).\n\nWe then asked if in response to autophagic stimuli Beclin1 is upregulated through ERK signaling. In total, 0.1 \u03bcM, 1 \u03bcM, 10 \u03bcM and 20 \u03bcM PD98059 in a concentration-dependent manner inhibited METH-induced Beclin1 mRNA expression. A total of 20 \u03bcM PD98059 significantly inhibited METH-induced Beclin1 mRNA expression compared with METH treatment alone (Figure 4e). Twenty micrometer PD98059 was used in the following experiments. Twenty micrometer PD98059 also significantly inhibited METH-induced Beclin1 protein expression (Figures 4f and g). These data suggest that upregulation of Beclin1 is ERK-dependent. In contrast, treatment with METH showed a downregulation of phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated mTOR, 6 h post treatment (Figures 4h and i). These results showed that METH induced autophagy in HUVECs by inhibiting the Akt/mTOR pathway and upregulating the ERK1/2 pathway.\n\nUnder pathological conditions, autophagy is considered to have a pro-survival role.24 Therefore, we asked whether suppression of METH-induced autophagy may accelerate cell death. Therefore, two well-characterized inhibitors of autophagy, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and chloroquine, were used in parallel in this study. 3-MA and chloroquine have different structures, different mechanisms of action and act at early and late stages of autophagy progression, respectively. 3-MA is a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor that prevents autophagy at the earliest stage of autophagosome formation. Chloroquine is a weak base that concentrates in acidic vesicles such as lysosomes and disrupts vesicular acidification compromising their degradative and recycling capacity.26 First, we used 3-MA to examine whether inhibition of autophagy can enhance METH-induced apoptosis. HUVECs were either pretreated with or without 3-MA before the addition of 1 \u03bcM METH for 72 h. Cells were stained with Annexin V (green) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. 3-MA markedly increased apoptosis induction by METH at 72 h, as measured by Annexin V labeling. 3-MA alone caused minimal apoptosis at 72 h (Figures 5a and b). These findings suggest that inhibition of autophagy can accelerate apoptosis. Second, 100 \u03bcM chloroquine also significantly increased METH-induced caspase-3 activity (Figure 5c). These findings suggest that although 3-MA and chloroquine have different mechanisms of action, they both can accelerate METH-induced apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy.\n\nWe have shown that KOR has a role in METH-induced autophagy (Figure 3). To determine whether inhibiting METH-induced autophagy triggers apoptosis, we also examined effects of the KOR antagonist pretreatment on METH- induced apoptotic cell death. Pretreatment with nor-BNI resulted in an increase in the number of apoptotic cells (12.90%) compared with METH treatment (8.14%) and control (1.32%) (Figure 5d). To further determine the mechanism underlying METH-induced apoptosis in the context of an autophagic block, caspase activity was measured in METH-treated HUVECs using Caspase-Glo 8, Caspase-Glo 3/7 and Caspase-Glo 9 assay systems in the presence or absence of MEK inhibitor PD98059. Although METH treatment alone resulted in modest induction of caspase-3/7, the induction was dramatically increased when cells were pretreated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Figure 5e). We also investigated the effect of knockdown of Beclin1 on the caspase-3 activity of HUVECs. HUVECs were transfected with Beclin1 siRNA. Beclin1 mRNA expression was detected by real-time PCR analysis. The activity of caspase-3 was also measured in HUVECs transfected with Beclin1 knockdown. The results showed that Beclin1 siRNA transfection significantly decreased the mRNA expression of Beclin1 in the transfected HUVECs compared with scramble siRNA transfection (Figure 5f). METH significantly increased caspase-3 activity in the HUVECs with Beclin1 knockdown compared with METH treatment alone (Figure 5g). In conclusion, METH promoted cell apoptosis in the presence of Beclin1 knockdown in HUVECs.\n\nThese results further supported our hypothesis that acute treatment with METH triggered a pro-survival mechanism, and inhibition of signaling pathways leading to autophagy resulted in accelerated apoptosis.\n\nOur study demonstrated that METH disrupted HBMECs and HUVECs barrier function in a time-dependent manner. Low-dose METH at early time points induced the conversion of LC3-I into LC3-II and increased LAMP1 in endothelial cells. Interestingly, METH upregulated Beclin1 expression through KOR and ERK1/2 pathways. Furthermore, METH-induced autophagy in endothelial cells was triggered by inactivation of the AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway and activation of the ERK1/2 pathway (Figure 6). METH-induced autophagy was regulated by the Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex. Changes in Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex have been observed in endothelial cell autophagy when treated with anti-angiogenic inhibitors.27 METH also promoted caspase activity and suppression of autophagy accelerated METH-induced apoptosis.\n\nMETH is an illicit recreational drug known to have effects on multiple organ systems. Exposure to METH leads to neurotoxic effects, which include damage to dopaminergic and serotonergic terminals, dopamine release, endoplasmic reticulum stress, activation of mitochondrial death cascades, glutamate release and hyperthermia.28 In an attempt to better clarify the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for neurotoxicity, most studies have focused on oxidative stress, activation of transcription factors, DNA damage, excitotoxicity, microglial activation and various apoptotic pathways.29, 30 More recent studies suggested that METH-induced neurotoxicity may also result from its ability to induce impairment of BBB function. The BBB has a predominant role in actively transporting nutrients to the brain and filtering harmful compounds from the brain back to the bloodstream. This process guarantees the homeostasis of the brain microenvironment, necessary for neuronal activity and proper functioning of the CNS.31 METH induces a transient increase in the permeability of the BBB in the hippocampus comparing with the frontal cortex and striatum, which can be explained by alterations in the tight junction proteins and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9).32 However, the direct effects of low-dose METH in modulating BBB breakdown are not fully understood.\n\nMost human studies have assessed only the effects of high-dose, long-term METH abuse (e.g., greater than 1000 mg/day) in individuals meeting DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) criteria for METH dependence. For the majority of METH abusers, however, patterns of METH exposure that consist of lower doses remain less well understood. The blood concentration of METH in drug abusers are in the low micromolar range, with median and mean concentrations of 1.3 \u03bcM (0.19 mg/l) and 2 \u03bcM (0.3 mg/l), respectively.10 Endothelial cell barrier dysfunction was also observed at 1 \u03bcM of METH, suggesting that the BBB is compromised under typical abuse conditions.3 Interestingly, low-dose METH (1 \u03bcM) exposure, in two dopaminergic neuronal-derived cell lines (rat pheochromocitoma PC12 and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y) resulted in induction of autophagy and suppression of autophagy precipitated neuronal cell death.1 In addition, another study showed that METH triggers an autophagic sequestering process in the dopaminergic SK-N-SH cell line by inducing the expression of LC3-II in a dose-dependent manner.33 However, no studies to date have investigated the effects of METH at doses seen in METH addicts in BBB endothelial cells.\n\nWe therefore investigated the functional role of autophagy in low-dose METH on endothelial cells. LC3 and Beclin1 are two key proteins for autophagy function. In this study, we first demonstrate that METH induced higher levels of LC3-II. LC3-II formation is regarded as a reliable biochemical evidence of autophagy as the amount of LC3-II usually correlates well with the number of autophagosomes.34 In our study, Beclin1 expression was also increased in a time-dependent manner. Beclin1 has a role in the initiation step and is essential for the formation of the autophagosome. The anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 has a negative regulatory role in autophagy by blocking an essential protein in the signaling pathway, Beclin1.15 METH induces autophagy in the human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cell line by inhibiting the dissociation of Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex and its upstream pathway that leads to cell death.35 Our data revealed that METH downregulated Bcl-2, which released Beclin1 from its asscociation with Bcl-2 thereby promoting autophagy (Figure 6). Beclin1 interacts with Bcl-2, suggesting cross-talk between two potential programmed cell death pathways. It has been reported that activation of MEK/ERK downstream of AMPK leads to an increase in Beclin1 expression.36 To examine if the activation of the ERK pathway is directly related to the increase of Beclin1, we found that MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 prevented METH-induced Beclin1 mRNA and protein expressions in the endothelial cells (Figures 4e and f).\n\nAlthough several signaling pathways regulate autophagy, signaling from the cytoplasm to the autophagy machinery is controlled in a negative manner through serine/threonine kinase, a mTOR. Protein kinase B or Akt (PKB/Akt), a positive regulator of mTOR, suppresses the formation of autophagosomes and inhibits autophagy.34 In addition, the Raf-1/MEK1/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway is known to be involved in regulating autophagy.37 A recent study shows that inhibition of the pathway by a MAPK kinase (MAPKK) MEK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059), suppresses starvation-induced autophagy in the human colon cancer HT-29 cell line.38 Our study clearly showed that METH inhibited the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway and activated the ERK signaling pathway, resulting in the induction of autophagy in endothelial cells (Figures 4 and 6).\n\nAutophagy has been shown to engage in a complex interplay with apoptosis in both physiological and pathological settings. Autophagy can serve as a cell survival pathway in some cellular settings by suppressing apoptosis, and in other settings, it can lead to programmed cell death, either in collaboration with apoptosis or as a back-up mechanism when the former is defective.39 It has been reported that suppression of autophagy precipitated neuronal cell death following low doses of METH.1 To evaluate the protective or the detrimental role of autophagy by METH in endothelial cells, we determined cell death (Figure 5a) in HUVECs for up to 72 h. Our results showed an increase in cell death in the presence of 3-MA, an inhibitor of class III PI3k activity widely used to inhibit autophagy. KOR antagonist and MEK1 inhibitor also accelerated METH-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the early autophagic response is a survival mechanism for endothelial cells and were mediated through the KOR (Figure 6). These results help to rule out that autophagy represents a detrimental mechanism. More importantly, our data emphasize that autophagy is an early response to METH-induced stress and may have a protective role in cell death.\n\nIn conclusion, our data indicate that autophagy is an early response to the METH-induced stress and may have a protective role during early exposure to the drug. However, chronic exposure to METH allows for progression through autophagic flux and commits cells to apoptotic death. These results help to explain how chronic exposure of METH can contribute to endothelial injury. These findings clarify the link between autophagy and apoptosis signaling induced by METH abuse.\n\nMETH, MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), zVAD-fmk, pepstatin A, E-64d, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), chloroquine and \u03b1-tubulin antibody were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).

Primary HBMECs were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10% Nu-Serum, 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM pyruvate, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 \u03bcg/ml), essential amino acids and vitamins (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). All cell-culture dishes were coated with rat-tail collagen type I (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA, USA).\n\nElectric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) electrode arrays (8W10E+) were obtained from Applied BioPhysics (Troy, NY, USA). Each array slide consists of eight individual wells treated for cell culture. Cells were harvested from 100-mm dishes and plated at 3 \u00d7 105 cells/500 \u03bcl in each well of ECIS arrays to obtain a confluent layer of cells covering the electrode surface. Complete single-layer electrode coverage was confirmed microscopically before treatment. To determine whether METH impaired endothelial cell barrier function, we used the ECIS to examine the effects of METH on endothelial cell monolayer resistances. HBMECs and HUVECs were treated with METH 1 \u03bcM in the absence or presence of zVAD-fmk, and changes in the resistance were continuously monitored for up to 72 h.\n\nCell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (Sigma) and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Total protein concentration was determined by Bradford method. Whole-cell extracts (20 \u03bcg) were electrophoresed on a sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE), and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).

To verify the quality of loading, the blots were reprobed with anti-\u03b1-tubulin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).\n\nImmunofluorescence staining was carried out using antibodies against LC3 (Cell Signaling) and Beclin1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). DyLight TM488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories Inc.) was used as the secondary antibody. HUVECs were transiently transfected with LAMP1-GFP by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). LAMP1-GFP construct is a generous gift from Dr Sundaram Ramakrishnan (University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA).\n\nRhodaminephalloidin or DAPI (Life Technologies) was used to visualize F-actin and the nucleus, respectively. Fields were chosen randomly from various regions to ensure objectivity of sampling. Digital images at \u00d7 400 magnification were acquired using a Nikon confocal microscope.\n\nTransmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of HUVECs was carried out as previously described40 on cellular pellets obtained after centrifugation at 1000 \u00d7 g for 5 min. Cell pellets were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 40 min. After three washes with 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, samples were post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO4) for 30 min. Following three rinses, samples were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol. Samples were subsequently embedded in Epon 812 resin. Thin sections (65 nm) were cut by using a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, then examined using a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope (JEOL, Peabody, MA, USA).\n\nCaspase-8, Caspase-3/7 and Caspase-9 activities were analyzed using Caspase-Glo luminescent-based assays according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). Cells (1 \u00d7 104) were seeded into 96-well white opaque plates and a corresponding optically clear 96-well plate, then allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (20 \u03bcM) was added 2 h before the cells were treated with METH for 24 h. At the end of the incubation time, 100 \u03bcl of the appropriate Caspase-Glo reagent was added to each well containing 100 \u03bcl of blank, negative control or treated cells in culture medium. Plates were gently mixed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The luminescence was then read in a FLUOstar OPTIMA Microplate Reader (BMG LABTECH, Cary, NC, USA). Caspase activity was normalized to vehicle treatment.\n\nON-TARGET plus SMART Pool Human Beclin1 siRNA (L-010552-00) and human KOR siRNA (L-005684-00) were used as per the manufacturer's instructions.
