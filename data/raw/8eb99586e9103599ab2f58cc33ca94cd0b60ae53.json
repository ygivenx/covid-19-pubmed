{"title": "Epidemiological and ecological modelling reveal diversity in upper respiratory tract microbial population structures from a cross-sectional community swabbing study Key words Ecology, Epidemiology, Respiratory Infection Running Title Application of epidemiological and ecological modelling to microbial populations Corresponding Author", "body": "Respiratory tract infections (RTI) remain a significant cause of mortality worldwide, with 2.8 million deaths, from an estimated four million per annum, resulting from lower RTI and a further 3,000 deaths resulting from upper RTI in 2010 (1) . An estimated six million individuals in the UK visit their general practitioner each year regarding a RTI, posing a substantial burden on the health service (2) .\n\nMicrobial carriage of pathogens in the upper respiratory tract is a precursor to RTI, meningitis and sepsis and can also facilitate the transmission of microbes between individuals. Carriage is a dynamic process involving fluctuations of species and strains (3) .\n\nThe interactions and interplay between bacterial and viral species within the respiratory tract is thought to affect the shift from asymptomatic carriage to serious invasive illness (4) . Such interactions will be driven by species presence and diversity of the resident communities of the respiratory tract. Here diversity in species richness and abundance is thought to offer protection from invading pathogens and overgrowth of a single species (5, 6) . It is likely that the dynamics of community structure may impact on infection risk. Species diversity can be measured in the presence of different species within the respiratory tract (inter-species diversity) or the presence of different bacterial strains and types of a single species (intraspecies). The former can be assessed using conventional culture methods or molecular techniques such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing (7, 8) . Intra-species analysis gives insight into the distribution of different types of a species that may display differential capacity for disease. It requires techniques such as serotyping and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) (9) (10) (11) (12) , or expansions of the MLST methodology such as whole-genome MLST (wgMLST) (13) and ribosomal MLST (rMLST) (14) .\n\nThe processes that sustain biodiversity may involve species occupying more or less distinct ecological niches, or they may involve neutral processes of stochastic zero-sum dynamics amongst more or less identical species (15) . Niche dynamics describe the distinct nutritional and environmental influences that determine the occurrences and abundances of different species (16, 17) . Neutral dynamics describe stochastic influences on species abundance and diversity, such as birth, death, immigration, dispersal and speciation (5, 18) . These alternative dynamics have been much studied in terms of species distribution and community assembly patterns for plant-insect (19), plant-fungi (20) and parasite-fish (21) interactions. They have not, to our knowledge, been applied to respiratory tract microbial ecology.\n\nHere, we aim to understand how bacterial and viral species maintain diversity within the respiratory tract, the nature of their interactions and the factors influencing community assembly and colonisation. To our best knowledge this is the first study that aims to discern multi-species epidemiology using a broad cross-sectional community cohort with the added dimension of seasonality. This was achieved using culture-based techniques, molecular methods, mathematical modelling and the application of ecological models.\n\nNose swab samples were collected as part of a large population-based cross-sectional carriage study undertaken with two separate time-points, May to August 2012 (late spring/summer) and February to April 2013 (winter/early spring), following protocols described in reference (22) . Briefly this involved the collection of nose swabs from the two time-points were collected from different individuals from twenty general practitioners (GP) practices from the South East hub of the Wessex Primary Care Research Network.

(27, 28) ) and genes associated with virulence (Pathogenic Bacteria Database (VFBD) (29, 30) ). Antigens that are or have been considered as vaccine candidates were of particular interest. S. pneumoniae vaccine candidates included piaA, pspA, pspC/cbpA, psaA, nanA, lytA and ply (31) (32) (33) (34) . H. influenzae vaccine candidates included hpd, ompP2, ompP5, tbpA/B, hmw1/2 and Hia (35, 36) . iPCRess was also used to identify penicillin binding protein genes pbp1a, pbp2x and pbp2b genes within S. pneumoniae isolates (37) and the H. influenzae protein D (hdp) gene (38) .\n\nSimpson's Index of Diversity, 1 -D, was used to quantify the diversity of species' serotypes and STs. The value of D gives the probability that two randomly-sampled individuals belong to different species. The index was calculated from the sum across all species of the number of individuals of each species: plates were counted and CFU/ml values calculated for each dilution. All dilutions were also extracted using the QIAxtractor nucleic extraction and amplified in duplicate on the Rotor-Gene Q. The CFU/ml for each dilution was then correlated to a given C T value to create a standard curve for each species, which was then used for quantification.\n\nAll ecological analyses used real-time PCR results for bacterial species from nose swabs (N = 190 species).\n\n.

A strongly nested system has a highly predictable sequence of species incidence amongst samples, while a weakly nested system has a more random turnover of species incidence. A nestedness tool, PlotTemp.R, was used within the R graphical user interface (CRAN, version 3.0.1) to determine spatial ordering amongst nose-swab samples analysed with real-time PCR. Real-time PCR datasets were converted to incidence matrices of the presence/absence of each species in each sample. The plot_temp script shuffles each matrix to rank its rows of samples by their richness (most species rich at top) and its columns of species by their incidence (most frequently present to left). Within the final shuffled matrix, presences are represented by red squares and absences by white squares. Their locations in the matrix are compared to a line of perfect fill that would encompass all presences if they were perfectly packed towards the top-left of the matrix. This line then reveals the locations of 'surprise' presences lying to its right and 'surprise' absences lying to its left. The degree of disorder in the matrix is reported as a matrix 'temperature', ranging from 0-100\u00b0, calculated as a function of the sum across all surprises of squared deviations from the line of perfect fill. Low temperatures reveal strong nesting, characteristic of highly ordered systems, and high temperatures reveal weak nesting, characteristic of disordered systems. Nestedness was compared between groups of individuals partitioned by age, recent RTI and season.\n\nThe distributions of the different bacterial and viral species across swab samples were analysed by plotting the observed frequencies of 1, 2, 3, \u2026 species within swab samples.\n\nThis observed distribution was compared to the Poisson distribution as a null model of random species affiliations. Deviations of observed frequencies from Poisson expectation were detected with p < 0.05 in a X 2 goodness-of-fit test. Narrower and more peaked distributions than Poisson expectation indicated a more regular than random distribution, with many swab samples containing a similar number of species, providing indirect evidence of mutual repulsion in competition. Wider and flatter distributions than Poisson expectation indicated a more clumped than random distribution, with many swab samples containing few or numerous species, providing indirect evidence of mutual attraction in facilitation.\n\nFrequency distributions were compared between groups of individuals partitioned by age, recent RTI and season.\n\n.

This model compares an ecological environment to a stick that is broken at random points to produce fragments of lengths that represent the abundances of different species (39, 40) .\n\nDeviations from neutral expectation were detected with p < 0.05 in a X 2 goodness-of-fit test.\n\nObservations of rare species below neutral expectation indicate niche characteristics of a dominance hierarchy, while observations of rare species above neutral expectation indicate niche characteristics of resource segregation (15) . Individual GP practice participation varied from 9.3% (n = 27) to 33.1% (n = 96) in the summer self-swabbing group and 9.1% (n = 21) to 30.4% (n = 80) in the winter selfswabbing group.

S. pneumoniae beta-lactam susceptibility genes were pbp1a (n = 195, 93.3%), pbp2x (n = 201, 96.2%) and pbp2b (n =185, 88.5%).\n\nGenes associated with beta-lactam resistance blaTEM (n = 6, 8.1%) and aminoglycoside resistance aph(3')-I (n = 3, 4.1%) were identified in H. influenzae isolates.\n\nPrevalence of vaccine candidate genes in the 34 S. pneumoniae isolates were lytA (n = 34, and hia (n = 11, 34.4%).\n\nA total of 12 (2.9%) methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates were identified within 409 nose isolates of S. aureus tested. This included 10 (3.8%) in summer nose swabs and 2 (1.4%) in winter nose swabs. Figure 2 shows the more disordered turnover of species between samples for recently ill individuals (Fig. 2a) compared to healthy individuals (Fig. 2b) . Incidence was also more ordered amongst winter (Table 5) . Conversely, frequency distributions of microbial species richness did not deviate detectably from random amongst winter swabs samples (X 2 = 6.61, df = 6, p = 0.358), 5-17 year olds (X 2 = 8.35, df = 5, p = 0.138), year olds (X 2 = 5.32, df = 4, p = 0.256), \u2265 65 year olds (X 2 = 0.153, df = 3, p = 0.985) and individuals with recent RTI (X 2 = 7.46, df = 5, p = 0.189). For these classifications we therefore found no evidence of interactions between species, either facilitative or competitive.\n\nNose samples deviated from the neutral assembly model for samples from summer (X 2 = 12.36, df = 2, p = 0.015), individuals aged 5-17 years (X 2 = 11.24, df = 2, p = 0.024), 18-64 years (X 2 = 28.78, df = 2, p < 0.001) and \u2265 65 years (X 2 = 29.69, df = 2, p < 0.001) (Age models shown in Figure 3 ). Within these classifications, rarer species had lower abundances than neutral expectation, indicative of niche characteristics of a dominance hierarchy (cf. Fig.   3a for the 0-4 year age classification with no difference from neutral, and \n\nUnderstanding the prevalence and community distribution of bacterial and viral pathogens, particularly where carriage is a prerequisite for progression to disease, is a key undertaking in the on-going development of interventional responses to changing epidemiology. Here we set out to determine the distribution of pathobiont bacterial and viral species commonly associated with respiratory tract infections using culture-independent approaches and ecological models of community assemblage as well as co-occurrence. Using multivariate analysis of microbial prevalence, we demonstrated that age affects carriage for a number of The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/099069 doi: bioRxiv preprint this set of isolates, which is indicative of the effectiveness of current PCV-13 and Hib vaccines in targeting specific serotypes as well as the effect of herd immunity in protecting individuals within age groups unlikely to have received these vaccines (41, 42) . The high proportion of non-vaccine type (NVT) S. pneumoniae reflects the process of serotype replacement as a result of vaccination, although it is not thought to lead to future large increases in the incidence of invasive disease caused by NVTs (43) . The identification of increasingly common NVT serotypes 6C, 11A/D and 23B and non-typeable H. influenzae provides important information for the epidemiological assessment of vaccines and for the development of future vaccines.\n\nThe lack of ubiquity of potential vaccine targets within the isolates collected in this study may highlight certain difficulties in the development of protein-based vaccines against these species (32) . This knowledge will help to inform the targeting of future treatment and prevention strategies, including the development of new vaccines against S. aureus and M.\n\ncatarrhalis (44, 45) and vaccines targeting greater numbers of S. pneumoniae serotypes (46) . High intra-species diversity within these respiratory isolates is potentially a result of the pressures imposed by current vaccination strategies (47) as well as the high levels of recombination in S. pneumoniae (48) . Few antibiotic resistance genes within this group of isolates reflects the low and stable levels of antibiotic-resistant respiratory species in the UK (49) . Continued monitoring of levels of antibiotic resistance within respiratory isolates within the UK is essential for clinical treatment of infection (49) .\n\nThe ecological analyses showed a relatively high degree of ordering (nesting) in the incidence of species amongst the respiratory tract communities of older participants, those without recent RTI, and amongst winter samples, in contrast to a more disordered turnover amongst young children, those with recent RTI, and summer samples. Lower levels of nestedness in these individuals may be related to the reduced isolation of species, allowing greater transmission, and the role of the immune system in maintaining species diversity.\n\nFurthermore, communities within the respiratory tract were found to have a clumped frequency distribution of species (either few or many species present) amongst young individuals, consistent with facilitative relationships occurring between the species within the upper respiratory tract. Facilitative relationships may enhance transmission opportunities and survival of species carried in the respiratory tract. Respiratory species abundances were more consistent with a dominance hierarchy than a neutral assembly model for older participants, those without recent RTI and summer samples, but not for other classifications.\n\nThere are likely to be both niche and neutral processes involved in microbial community formation in the upper respiratory tract, with speciation and the environment playing key .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/099069 doi: bioRxiv preprint roles (50, 51) . The evidence that niche processes tend towards dominance hierarchies rather than resource segregation suggests that the microbial species compete for similar resources; moreover, communities may have fragile coexistence equilibria, with some dominant competitors functioning as keystone species capable of triggering cascades of extinctions (15) . Further development of ecological methodologies will allow predictions of microbial variation as a result of infection, season and increasing age. Monitoring communities in states of health and disease is important for generating knowledge that will be useful in clinical practice (52) .\n\nInferences from this study should be understood in the context of a number of methodological constraints. The characteristics of the 21% (n = 2103) of responders may differ from those of non-responders. The study focused on a limited number of species, and did not account for species such as Group A Streptococci which may play an important role within this sample site as well as other non-culturable species. Furthermore, the swab samples used were not optimised for the detection of viral species. The questionnaire used for the study was designed for simplicity and ease of completion. This meant that information was not collected on a number of important factors, including smoking status, siblings, and attendance at nursery or day-care facilities. Samples assessed by real-time PCR were limited by the number of species that were targeted as well as the non-random nature of their selection. The ecological models ignore acquired or specific host immunity, which can influence the ecology of the respiratory tract (53) . The combined analysis of bacterial and viral species, and the combined analysis of all RTI, may also be simplistic. Neutral theory assumes no variation in the total number of species within a community whilst niche theory ignores dispersal (54, 55) . The quantification of nestedness provides only a single measure of matrix temperature per classification of samples, ruling out significance testing.\n\nThe study has provided key epidemiological information on spatio-temporal patterns and \n\nALC contributed to study set-up, data collection, data analysis and writing of the manuscript.\n\nCPD and ARK contributed to study-design, data analysis and manuscript preparation.
