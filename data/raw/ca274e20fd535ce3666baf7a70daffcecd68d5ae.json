The heart rate was around 200 rpm, and the mean blood pressure was 95-100 mm Hg. Thoracic and abdominal X-rays were normal. These clinical findings suggested the cat was in postictal state, in nonconvulsive status epilepticus, or extreme sensitivity to the adverse effects of PB. Phenobarbital was discontinued, and zonisamide (ZNS; 4.6 mg/kg PO q12h), meloxicam (0.3 mg/kg SC q24h), ampicillin (25 mg/kg IV q12h), and IV fluid therapy with glycyrrhizin and glutathione were administered. Two days later (day 7), seizures were under control, and the above-mentioned neurological findings and temperature had recovered. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (0.4 Tesla Aperto; Hitachi, Japan) of the head was performed on day 8, which revealed bilateral hippocampal swelling with T2-weighted/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity and T1-weighted hypointensity that showed strong contrast enhancement after IV administration of gadodiamide (0.2 mL/kg; Omniscan, Daiichi-Sankyo, Japan) on transverse ( Figure 1 ) and dorsal planes.\n\nA cerebrospinal fluid tap was not performed due to suspected increased intracranial pressure indicated by narrowing sulci, ventricles (on transverse and dorsal planes), and cisterna magna (on sagittal plane) (not shown). From these MRI findings, feline hippocampal necrosis (FHN) and limbic encephalitis (LE) were suspected. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] After MRI, in addition to ZNS (serum level was 15.3 \u03bcg/mL), prednisolone (1 mg/kg, PO q24h for 4 days, then 0.5 mg/kg PO q24h for After the histologic diagnosis of LE, serum samples, which had been collected and stored when measuring ZNS levels, were analyzed for autoantibodies against leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1). [5] [6] [7] Immunological methods are summarized in the Supporting Information. A live cell staining using rat-cultured hippocampal neurons showed that the cat serum and human serum from a patient with LE (used as a positive control) contained antibodies to neuronal cell surface proteins ( Figure 3) . Additionally, the same procedure was performed in 3 healthy cats and 3 epileptic cats as negative controls.\n\nAlthough 1 healthy cat serum (#1) antibodies bound to neurons (shown in the Supporting Information), other control sera did not bind at all (Figure 3) . A cell-based binding assay for LGI1 was performed, as\n\nLGI1 autoantibodies are frequently found in humans and cats with LE. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] The case cat serum antibodies as well as control (healthy and epileptic) cats serum antibodies (diluted 1 : 500) nonspecifically bound to COS7 (a common cell line originated from an African green monkey kidney) cell-surface slightly, irrespective of the expression of the LGI1 Then, a cell-surface binding assay using COS7 cells transfected with DCC was performed. Human neuromyotonia patient serum, used as a positive control, 8 bound to the DCC-expressing cells. The case cat serum showed a specific and strong binding to DCC-expressing cells ( Figure 6 ).\n\nAlthough healthy and epileptic control cats' sera showed nonspecific slight binding to COS7 cells as well as Figure 4 (all 3 cats in each group were tested), the specific binding of serum antibodies to DCC was not observed in healthy and epileptic control cats. Therefore, the case cat had DCC autoantibodies.\n\nAutoimmune LE is 1 of the common causes of acute repetitive seizures (also referred to as cluster seizures) or status epilepticus in human. 11 have been reported. Autoimmune LE is often associated with neoplasms (paraneoplastic) and the incidence of complications seems to depend on the type of autoantibodies. [11] [12] [13] Voltage-gated potassium channel complex/LGI1 antibodiesassociated LE is the most common autoimmune LE that induces late-onset epilepsy and status epilepticus in humans 8, 9, 11, 12 and occurs in cats. [5] [6] [7] In humans, although 20% of LE with VGKC complex/LGI1 antibodies have occurred along underlying neoplasms such as small-cell lung carcinoma and thymoma, 11,13 most of these were found in non-paraneoplasitc patients. In 1 study of cats, 1 of 5 cats with anti-VGKC LE had papillary adenomas in the lung. 14 In the present case, although no tumor could be confirmed by thoracic and abdominal radiographs, these findings could not necessarily exclude a neoplastic disease. Whole-body necropsy would have been necessary to address this. Therefore, we are not able to define whether there was an association with a neoplasm or not.\n\nThe cat was negative for LGI1 but we found DCC antibodies that might be the cause of autoimmune LE and FHN. To our knowledge, diseases associated with DCC or its antibodies have not been reported in cats (nor in dogs) to date. Although DCC was first suggested as a candidate tumor suppressor gene for colorectal cancer, subsequent studies proved DCC is 1 of the receptors of netrin-1 that is an axon guidance molecule (secretory protein). 15, 16 Netrin-1 and DCC mediate axon guidance or neuronal migrations. Netrin-1 and DCC knockout mice have commissural dysplasia in the central nervous system. 10, 15 Also, DCC has been identified as a causative gene of congenital mirror movement in human. 17 DCC regulates synaptic function including NMDA receptordependent synaptic plasticity in maturated brains. 18, 19 Anti-DCC autoantibodies are associated more with thymoma and myasthenia gravis and less with LE. 8, 20 In 1 human study, however, 4 of 12 patients with DCC antibodies were diagnosed as LE although F I G U R E 4 The case cat serum antibodies do not bind to leucinerich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1). COS7 cells were transfected with cell-surface expressed LGI1 tagged with the FLAG epitope and GPI anchor signal. Transfected cells were fixed and doubly stained with serum immunoglobulin G (IgGs) (right column, red) together with the antibodies to the FLAG tag (left column, green). Human LE patient serum was used as a positive control (tops). Nuclear DNA was stained by Hoechst 33342 (blue) to distinguish untransfected cells. Scale bar, 20 \u03bcm. See also the Supporting Information the association was not statistically significant. 8 These LE patients with DCC antibodies had also LGI1 antibodies that were significantly associated with LE. Thus, LE of these patients might have originated from LGI1 antibodies rather than DCC antibodies. However, we excluded the association of LGI antibodies in the present cat; therefore, this might be the first LE case associated only with DCC antibodies through human and feline autoimmune LE. Recent studies suggested DCC and netrin-1 contribution to synaptic excitation. 18, 19 Therefore, the possibility of direct contribution of DCC antibodies to the pathogenesis of LE should be considered in the future.\n\nEleven cases of feline LE associated with VGKC complex/LGI1 antibody were treated successfully with immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. 5, 6 In the case presented here, we did not suspect LE at first diagnosis, so the cat was treated with medium to low doses of prednisolone (0.5-1.0 mg/kg) for 2 weeks for treatment of brain edema (hippocampal swelling). During prednisolone treatment, seizures were well controlled and other clinical signs also improved. Generally, in human medicine, paraneoplastic LEs have poor response to immunosuppressive treatment, whereas non-paraneoplastic LEs show comparatively good response. 11 In addition, it is also described that human patients with paraneoplastic epilepsy are poorly responsive to antiepileptic drugs and require earlier treatment for underlying tumors. 13 We could not define whether the present cat was paraneoplastic or non-paraneoplastic, whether it was associated with DCC antibodies only or whether there was coexistence of multiple antibodies, and whether F I G U R E 5 Immunoprecipitation of the cell surface target protein with cat serum antibodies. The immunoprecipitates of serum antibodies bound to rat hippocampal neurons were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with silver staining (upper). The specific band at 190 kDa (an arrow) was analyzed by mass spectral analysis. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting (lower) with anti-deleted in colorectal carcinoma (DCC) mouse monoclonal antibody.

COS7 cells were transfected to surface-express DCC. Transfected cells were fixed and doubly stained with the serum immunoglobulin G (IgGs) (right column, red) together with an antibody to DCC (left column, green). Note that the case cat serum antibodies, neither healthy nor epileptic control cats serum antibodies, specifically bind to DCCexpressing cells. Human neuromyotonia (NMT) patient serum was used as a positive control (tops). The slight dot-like signals observed in cat IgG (right panels) is noisy background, which was observed in all cat serum IgG, irrespective of transfected cells. Scale bar, 20 \u03bcm.

Diagnoses of these factors could possibly provide more appropriate therapeutic regimen for cats with LE.\n\nThis case was presented as an oral presentation at the annual congress of the Japanese Society of Veterinary Neurology, Iwate, Japan, June 2018.\n\nAdditional supporting information may be found online in the Supporting Information section at the end of this article.
