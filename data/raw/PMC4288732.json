{"title": "Using Modelling to Disentangle the Relative Contributions of Zoonotic and Anthroponotic Transmission: The Case of Lassa Fever", "body": "Diseases at the animal-human interface are in general subjected to different modes of cross-species transmission: animal-to-animal, animal-to-human, human-to-human and even human-to-animal. Estimating the relative contribution of each is of fundamental importance for the planning and implementation of appropriate infection control and preventive measures. This can be an extremely difficult task if humans and animals share the same physical space, and/or if experimentation (e.g. to quantify the probability of animal-to-animal transmission) is subjected to serious limitations. This is the case of Lassa fever (LF), a rodent-borne disease endemic in West Africa. Despite its clear zoonotic origin, there are strong arguments, listed below, to hypothesize that a significant proportion of the burden of LF in humans arises from human-to-human transmission. The aim of this work is to test whether or not patterns in the epidemic curve describing the cases of LF observed in Sierra Leone [1], are compatible with patterns observed in chains of pure human-to-human transmission recorded in nosocomial and extra-nosocomial outbreaks [2], [3].\n\nLassa fever is an acute, viral hemorrhagic disease caused by Lassa fever virus (LASV), an enveloped RNA virus of the Arenaviridae. The disease was first recognized in the village of Lassa, Nigeria in 1969, which caused the death of two missionary-nurses and the grave illness of a third [4]. However, cases consistent with LF from the eastern part of Sierra Leone can be traced back to \n[5]. Since the identification of LASV, human-to-human transmission has been documented in several nosocomial outbreaks (e.g.\n[2], [3] and also [6] for a review), leading to an initial perception that the virus was both highly contagious and virulent [4]; this resulted in stringent requirements for containment of the patients [7]. Soon after, its zoonotic origin was recognized and Mastomys natalensis, one of the most common African rodents, was identified as the reservoir of the virus [8]. The risk of nosocomial transmission was shown to be dramatically reduced by using simple barrier nursing method [7], [9]\u2013[11], suggesting that the risk of human-to-human transmission might be negligible.\n\nThese findings support an apparent, modern-day consensus that in the epidemiology of the disease, human-to-human transmission plays a less important role compared to zoonotic transmission. Accordingly, it has been suggested that patients with LF in non-endemic countries should not be confined to biosafety level 4 containment [10], and patient containment guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the UK Department of Health and Social Security, in the past have been amended to be less restrictive (see [11], [12], also [13] and its previous versions).\n\nThis narrative concerning the relative importance of human-to-human transmission for LASV, however, requires re-evaluation as there are important indications of human-to-human transmission. More precisely, one of the early nosocomial outbreaks, in Jos, Nigeria (see [2], Fig. 1 and also the Supporting Information, S2 Text) was triggered by an index case that transmitted to possibly  others in the hospital, with no indication of iatrogenic transfer. Further cases of extra-hospital transmission within a single family (five from the same family, , , , , and  who likely initiated the chain) were reported, here and throughout we refer to this chain as an \u2018extra-nosocomial\u2019 chain. Haas et al.\n[14] investigated secondary transmission after an imported case of LF into Europe and found that one of  contacts that were tested serologically, a physician who examined the patient on day  of illness, had become infected. The authors concluded that, during the initial phase of symptomatic LF the risk of transmission is low, but it may increase with progression of disease and increasing viral excretion. Emond et al.\n[15] described a case of LF in the UK in which the virus was isolated from urine  days after the acute phase had ended, despite not being detected earlier. The virus may also be found in pharyngeal secretions for  weeks after the onset of clinical signs [16]. In an experimental model, Stephenson et al.\n[17] showed the ability to infect guinea pigs and cynomolgus monkeys with LASV via the respiratory route and Peters et al.\n[18] demonstrated fatal LASV transmission to monkeys through being held in the same room for  days with inoculated rodents. Sagripanti et al.\n[19], in a dark room at ambient laboratory temperatures controlled between  and  and  relative humidity, showed that the time required for a  reduction in viral load of LASV in glass containers was  hours and was  days for a  relative humidity. Also, Kern\u00e9is et al.\n[20] identified that risk factors for positive seroconversion to LASV included either having received a medical injection, or having lived with someone displaying a haemorrhage, in the previous twelve months. No factors related to contact with rodents were identified. Similarly, McCormick et al.\n[21] reported a lack of correlation between human LASV-specific IgG prevalence and either the level of domestic infestation by Mastomys, or the presence of LASV infection in Mastomys. These observations, taken together, suggest that a significant (if perhaps variable) proportion of the burden of LF might be associated with human-to-human transmission.\n\nEstimating the contribution of human-to-human transmission of LASV and related patterns of transmission (e.g. existence of super-spreaders) is of fundamental importance when considering risk assessment and control of LF and related diseases such as the one caused by the arenavirus, Lujo virus [22], not least because LF is one of the more common haemorrhagic fevers exported from endemic areas [23]\u2013[28]. In addition, perceiving LF as essentially a zoonotic disease only acquired from rodents with little or no infection arising from human beings, may have prevented investigations of the role, if any, of human-to-rodent transmission (i.e. spillback) in the epidemiology of LF.\n\nUnderstanding routes of transmission and the proportion of LF cases resulting from human-to-human transmission is critical for developing and prioritizing effective prevention and control interventions, especially in the presence of large variation among subjects in their capability of infecting. The current Ebola outbreak has emphasised further the need for targeted biosecure measures which distinguish managing hemorrhagic fever cases and outbreaks from preventing spillover from reservoirs. This issue has not previously been fully addressed for Lassa Fever. Traditional approaches, such as cluster analysis, to distinguish human-to-human transmission from pure zoonotic transmission cannot be employed here due to the potential of clustering of infection in households from common exposure to infected rodents in addition to clustering arising from infected people. We overcome this problem by adapting other approaches [29], [30], and using data from nosocomial and extra-nosocomial outbreaks and hospitalized patients in Kenema Governmental Hospital (KGH), Sierra Leone [1]. We use these data to provide an estimation of the contribution of human-to-human transmission to the Lassa fever occurrence in endemic areas and to provide a more-robust assessment of the risk of secondary spread from index cases.\n\nThe Tulane University Institutional Review Board and the Sierra Leone Ethics Committee approved the research [1]. Patients either approached KGH directly or were referred to the KGH Lassa Ward from regional health centers or the hospital's general ward on the basis of suspicion of LF. All adult subjects provided written informed consent for the analysis and publication of anonymized laboratory and clinical data. A parent or guardian of any child participant provided written informed consent on their behalf. All data were anonymized prior to analysis.\n\nLike Kenema in Sierra Leone, Jos and Zorzor are at the heart of the Nigerian and Liberian endemic areas of LF occurrence and, as in Sierra Leone, it is assumed that LASV has been circulating in these areas historically [5], [31], [32]. This is supported by molecular evidence that the Nigerian LASV strain is ancestral to the Sierra Leonean one [33]. In addition, although studies in human prevalence of antibodies to LASV exhibit variation amongst regions (e.g. low values in coastal areas), in general human seroprevalence appears to be similar in Nigeria and in the Mano River region (Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia) [20], [34]\u2013[40].\n\nFurthermore in recent decades, infection control has focused essentially in minimizing nosocomial transmission, albeit with partial success [41]\u2013[43]. In particular, a study by Tobin et al.\n[42] revealed a general lack of knowledge of barrier nursing among health workers in rural areas. This problem is expected to be even more persistent among non-professionals, suggesting that control measures have not significantly changed since LF was discovered. Hence despite these data sets being collected at quite different points in time, health-care practices have not changed meaningfully over this time period.\n\nFinally, the Jos/Zorzor outbreaks were exceptionally severe disease outbreaks, therefore by analyzing only hospitalized patients in KGH, we ensured that we are comparing equivalent situations.\n\nThese considerations justify the choice of comparing the data from KGH with the extra-nosocomial outbreak that occurred in Jos, while the appropriateness of comparing the KGH data with the nosocomial cases in the Jos outbreak is one of the hypothesis being tested in the current work.\n\nWe analyzed the data from two nosocomial LF outbreaks: Jos, Nigeria in 1970 ( cases) [2] and Zorzor, Liberia in 1972 ( cases) [3]. In the Jos outbreak, extra hospital infections with no contact with the index case were observed (a single family , , , , and  with the three children ,  and  who never visited the ward). These appear to be human-to-human chains; sampling and testing of rodents near the homes of LF patients in Jos, as well as in the larger geographic area, showed no evidence of LASV in rodents [2], further supporting human-to-human transmission maintaining these epidemics. Further details of the two outbreaks and the full networks of contacts are presented in the Supporting Information, S2 Text.\n\nIn contrast with many emerging zoonoses, the reported incidence of LF in people is high in endemic areas, as reflected in data from KGH in Sierra Leone [1] (Fig. 2), thus allowing a more robust analysis of the transmission dynamics. KGH is the only health facility in Sierra Leone where people can be diagnosed and treated for suspected LF. The hospital facilities include an isolation ward specifically for LF patients with a highly trained clinical staff equipped with appropriate personal protective equipment. KGH records provide hospitalized patient data (day of admission, day of discharge, etc.) for suspected and confirmed cases of LF, divided by age, gender, ethnic group, location and other factors [1].\n\nWe used data abstracted from patient medical charts and LF diagnostic tests for  suspected Lassa cases presenting to the KGH Lassa Ward from  of April  to the  of January . Among these subjects,  (Fig. 2) were confirmed as LF cases, i.e. either subjects with acute infection (tested positive LF using an antigen-based ELISA approach) or with recent LF (tested positive to IgM antibodies) [1]. These data correspond to the most accurate and complete set of patient records available at KGH. April  was chosen as the lower endpoint for our study sample due to significant improvements in data quality. These improvements are largely attributed to several NIH-funded research projects to develop and improve the diagnostic tests for LF. Improvements in clinical data quality can be attributed to more comprehensive questionnaire forms and increased community outreach and surveillance activities.\n\nWe calculated the effective reproduction number based on the observed dates of onset of symptoms, start and duration of exposure to the index cases and start and duration of exposure to all other cases. This information was directly obtained from the literature [2], [3], which provided detailed descriptions of the network of contacts (Fig. 1 and S1 table in S2 Text). Inspired by the work of Wallinga and Teunis [29], the relative likelihood  that case  has been infected by case  was calculated as:(1)here  is the time of exposure of case  to case  while case  is infectious, i.e. the interval  is given by the intersection , where  is the infectious period of case , calculated as the difference between the time , when the symptoms end (either because the patient recovers or dies) and the time , when the symptoms begin;  is the duration of exposure of case  to case  provided by the literature [2], [3]. It is important to note that , and thus , is explicitly time-dependent, (Fig. 1.D). The index  represents all possible cases within a nosocomial outbreak. Important underlying assumptions are: each event can independently start a new chain of human-to-human transmission, beginning of infectiousness coincides with the onset of symptoms, and infections occur with equal probability at any time during the interval . Accordingly, the sum  over all cases , represents the individual effective reproduction number for case  at the time  when the case arises. If multiple cases are observed at the same time , then  is averaged appropriately. To increase the sample size and improve the estimation, the duration of the symptoms of LF and the period spent at the hospital associated with each patient were randomly rearranged among the  cases (Fig. 1.C), then the ensemble average individual effective reproduction number was calculated based on  of these permutations. The network of contacts was kept the same. The identical approach was used to calculate the effective reproduction number, , for the extra-nosocomial situation, with the network of contacts restricted to the family , , ,  and  who presumably initiated the chain. We use the notation  and  to indicate the set of all individual effective reproduction numbers for the nosocomial and extra-nosocomial cases respectively, while the total effective reproduction numbers  and  represent the corresponding average number of cases during the entire outbreak, i.e.\n and  respectively. To adjust for the different duration expected in different outbreaks, we calculate a daily mean effective reproduction number as  and  where  and  are the typical duration of the nosocomial and extra-nosocomial outbreaks.\n\nThe correctness of the approach was corroborated by performing the same analysis but by imposing that each case is exposed only to the index case. For the situation in Jos, the individual reproduction numbers were zero for all cases except for  which results in , i.e. the only cases exposed to  and marked with a thin red line in Fig. 1.\n\nThe distribution of the quantity  is interpreted as the distribution of the generation time, i.e. the time between a primary case and a secondary case, and it is presented in Figs. 3.C and 3.D (see also Figures S2, S3, S4 and S5 in S2 Text).\n\nFollowing the approach of Wallinga and Teunis (see [29], [30] and their appendix for validation of the procedure), the relative likelihood that case  has been infected by case , given their difference in time of symptom onset , approximated here as the difference in time of admission to hospital, is then the likelihood that case  has been infected by case , normalized by the likelihood that case  has been infected by any other case \n(2)where  is the distribution for the generation interval and it is assumed to be the empirical distribution obtained from the nosocomial and extra-nosocomial outbreaks (shown in Figs. 3.C and 3.D). The effective reproduction number for case  is the sum over all cases , weighted by the relative likelihood that case  has been infected by case \n(3)\n\n\nThis quantity depends on the time  when case  occurs. The set of all  cases are obtained by the epidemic curve, describing the daily number of reported cases by date of symptom onset (Fig. 2),  is the total number of reported cases. Underlying this calculation is the assumption that the spread of the disease occurs through human-to-human transmission only, however, a substantial proportion of cases, , is expected to be due to zoonotic transmission, i.e. only through contacts with the rodent population, which can be considered as cases that have contracted infection from outside the population. These, therefore, cannot be regarded as secondary-tertiary etc. cases, although they can initiate a human-to-human chain. Under these circumstances, the effective reproduction number in equation (3) must be calculated by removing these  imported cases, i.e.\n(4)\n\n\nThe set of all individual effective reproduction numbers is indicated by , while  is the total effective reproduction number, i.e.\n, where to simplify the notation we dropped the dependency on . This value represents the average number of cases during the entire epidemic compatible with the particular generation time. As above, we averaged to obtain the daily mean effective reproduction number  where  is the duration of the epidemics. The calculations were carried out by using the R package R0, provided by Obadia and co-authors [30], [44].\n\nWe compared two published outbreaks to illustrate the likely bounds of human to human transmission. Initially, we assumed that the extent of human-to-human transmission in nosocomial outbreaks in Jos and Zorzor [2], [3] represent the general situation in an endemic area. Alternatively, we rejected this assumption and considered only the out of hospital human-to-human transmission in Jos (five from the same family, , , ,  and  who initiated the chain), as being representative of the general endemic situation. We estimated the generation number and the mean nosocomial reproduction numbers for these two alternatives. By imposing equality with the mean nosocomial reproduction numbers (either  or ), we inferred the proportion .\n\nTo allow comparison with the effective reproduction number for the Kenema data, which by definition is based only on outbreaks where the primary case is assumed to be among those reported [29], the index patients  and  from the Jos and Zorzor outbreaks were assumed to be secondary cases to unreported human cases. On the grounds of realism, and also computational economy, the epidemic curve from KGH (Fig. 2) is assumed to be a collection of multiple chains of mean duration , rather than a 2-year long un-interrupted epidemic. The starting times of each human-to-human chain were randomly chosen within the  year period of the KGH epidemic curve. Similarly, as humans and rodents share the same physical space, cross-species transmission can occur at any time, thus the  imported cases were randomly chosen from the network of contacts. For each value of , the ensemble sample of the simulations was .\n\n\nFigs. 3.A and 3.B show the effective reproduction number for each patient for the two nosocomial outbreaks respectively. As expected, the largest values are associated with the index case  and  for the Jos and Zorzor outbreaks, respectively. In several cases, however, the effective reproduction number ; particularly important is case  in the Jos outbreak with an effective reproduction number , who most likely initiated extra-nosocomial transmission in her family.\n\n\nFig. 4 shows the total effective reproduction number  and its daily mean  for the cases in KGH, vs the estimated proportion  of cases due to human-to-human transmission. The shaded grey area covers the range between  and  percentiles arising from the  simulations for each value of . The predictions were then compared with the total effective reproduction number (or with the equivalent daily mean), in the nosocomial outbreaks  (or ) based on the full network of cases and with the extra-nosocomial cases in Jos alone  (or ). For the full network of cases, the mean nosocomial reproduction number was higher than the mean KGH one, implying that the severe hospital outbreaks ought to be seen as exceptional circumstances. In contrast, the daily mean effective reproduction number arising from the Jos extra-hospital cases (due only to human-to-human transmission) was entirely compatible with the daily mean KGH effective reproduction number if we allow a proportion of cases to be due to human-to-human transmission . Based on the  and  percentiles in the predictions for the reproduction number , the lower and upper estimates for the proportion of human-to-human transmission are  and  respectively.\n\nSuper-spreaders are individuals who can infect a disproportionately large pool of susceptibles [45]. Here, super-spreading events are identified and quantified by analyzing how the effective reproduction number is distributed. The distribution of the individual effective reproduction numbers for the Jos and Zorzor outbreaks, based on the  permutations of the duration of illness, is shown in Fig. 5.A. Although  of the predictions for individual , there is a fat tailed distribution, with extreme values of . Similar patterns are observed for KGH cases for the individual effective reproduction number . As shown in Fig. 5.B and 5.C, the distribution of the individual and total, effective reproduction numbers,  and  appears to have a fat-tailed distribution, especially for larger values of .\n\nA simple approach to evaluate the risk of super-spreaders is to invoke the so-called \u201820/80 rule\u2019 (whereby  of cases cause  of transmission, see [45], [46]). To this end, for different values of the contribution of human-to-human transmission, , we calculated i) the proportion of cases when  (Fig. 6.A), and ii) its proportional impact, given by the expected, relative number of secondary cases generated by this proportion (see Fig. 6.B for further explanations); the maximum  in the simulations was also recorded. For a contribution of human-to-human transmission in the region of , only  of realizations gave , but they are, on average, responsible for  of secondary cases, with a maximum . In an extreme situation, when the disease is transmitted only by humans,  of cases are responsible for the  of secondary cases with a maximum  up to , which resembles the \u201820/80 rule\u2019.\n\nMore sophisticated ways to assess the risk of super-spreaders are presented in the S2 Text. In particular, we fitted the distribution for the individual effective reproduction number  from KGH with an exponential and a log-normal distribution. The observed KGH distribution is \u2018fatter\u2019 than the corresponding exponential fit, although not as heavy as the log-normal. Furthermore we fitted two standard discrete distributions, the Poisson, representative of thin-tailed distributions, and the negative-binomial, representative of fat-tailed distributions, with the distribution for the integer part (as we are considering discrete distributions) of , i.e. the average number of cases during the entire epidemic. As can be seen, the last distribution is better fitted by a negative-binomial distribution, especially for the tail (S6 Figure in S2 Text).\n\nDifferent values for the typical duration of a human-to-human chain, , were explored. As expected, the longer the duration, , the larger the availability of susceptibles and the higher the effective reproduction number. However, when the effective reproduction number is rescaled by the duration of the epidemics, i.e. the daily mean effective reproduction number , all the predictions are similar. This can be seen by comparing the plots  in Figs. 4.B ( days), 4.D ( days) and S1 Figure in S2 Text ( days).\n\nBased on this invariance, we can infer the proportion , irrespective of the choice of the mean duration , provided that we know the typical duration of the nosocomial and extra-nosocomial chains  and . For the nosocomial case, a reasonable choice is  days, which is the average duration of nosocomial outbreaks observed in Jos and Zorzor hospitals ( and  days respectively, the last days correspond to when the last person developed symptoms). For the extra-nosocomial chains the choice is less clear, as the member of the family were already in contact with the index case  before she developed symptoms, and shedding of the virus could happen any time before symptom onset. Therefore we made a conservative choice of  days which corresponds to the maximum duration of the Jos outbreak (here the last day corresponds to when case  recovered). Any shorter choice of the duration , will result in a larger value of the proportion  (for instance if the typical duration of the outbreak is  days, i.e. including while  was at the hospital, we found that  instead of  while the estimates based on the intersection with the -percentile and -percentile were  and  respectively rather than  and ), which reinforces the key message of this current work that a significant proportion of cases of LF arises from human-to-human transmission.\n\nThe robustness of the approach was tested by considering different distributions for the generation time. We considered i) the distribution of generation time arising from the entire network, ii) the distribution arising from the particular subset of the data corresponding to the extra-nosocomial cases , , ,  and , iii) a gamma distribution with the same empirical mean and variance, iv) the empirical distribution by removing part of the tail, v) a \u2018stretched\u2019 distribution by multiplying the empirical generation times by a factor  to allow for a longer shedding of the virus, and vi) a \u2018shrunk\u2019 distribution by multiplying the empirical generation times by a factor . In general, each of these methods had limited effects on the predictions (see S2 Figure in S2 Text, S3 Figure in S2 Text, S4 Figure in S2 Text, and S5 Figure in S2 Text).\n\nThe current model is based on the assumption that the distribution of the generation times observed in the extra-nosocomial outbreak is representative of the generation times in the Sierra Leonean situations. This is probably reasonable, but public health measures may impact on this in the future. The predictions are based on the assumption of uniform mixing, i.e. each case from KGH is potentially in contact with each other case. Although this is a reasonable assumption, considering the large human mobility in Sierra Leone, for livelihoods, work and trade, social visits and events [54], it will overestimate . In addition, there is likely to be incomplete reporting which will underestimate . Although the two factors might compensate for each other, if KGH could reduce reporting bias and increase information on network contacts, it would be highly beneficial to studies such as this, especially as human mobility and overcrowding has been associated with an amplification of LF [31]. This represents a further area where participatory modeling/ethnographic research is much needed to gather information on actual patterns of mobility and social networking, and hence potential contact patterns.\n\nOther methods are possible, for example cluster-based inference of the reproduction number (see e.g.\n[55], [56]) is a promising approach. In the current context, Kern\u00e9is et al.\n[20] provided detailed information on prevalence and risk factors of Lassa (e.g. history of collecting, cutting and eating rats) stratified by age. In addition, the age distribution from KGH is also available. These data could be combined together to build a matrix of transmission rates among age-groups (as done in [55], [56]) and between rodents and each age-group with values based on the findings of Kern\u00e9is et al.\n[20].\n\nFor the KGH data, the difference in time of onset of symptoms was approximated here with the difference in time of visit/referral to the hospital following disease onset. This assumption can be an important source of error as patterns of health seeking behavior might vary largely among the Sierra Leonean population. For example, a particular group of the population might favor traditional medicine and approach institutional health care only at a late stage of the disease. Patients from rural areas might be subjected to further delay due to poor infrastructure. Health seeking behavior is perhaps one the most fruitful areas where participatory modeling and ethnographic research have been successfully employed and should be considered in the present context.\n\nThe estimations here are based on the assumption that probability of cross-species transmission occurs at random throughout outbreaks, although these events are expected to be strongly driven by a multitude of interacting causes, including ecological (e.g. seasonality in the abundance of the reservoir), epidemiological (e.g. seasonality in the prevalence of the pathogen), genetic variation (e.g. broad set of pathogen life histories) and socio-economic (e.g. the practice of burning the fields after harvesting affecting the ecology and dispersal patterns of M. natalensis) factors.\n\nThe estimation of the proportion of human-to-human transmission was based on the assumption that the typical duration of a chain of transmission is equal to the duration of the extra-nosocomial outbreak. As this information was only approximately known, we made the prudent choice that the duration of the extra-nosocomial outbreak was the entire extent of the outbreak in Jos, which was the maximum value from the data available. This led to a conservative estimation of . Despite some inevitable inaccuracies, all of our alternative/additional tests confirm that a significant proportion (in the region of  or greater) of the burden of LF is due to human-to-human transmission.\n\nThe basis of our work is that, to the best of our knowledge, the nosocomial and extra-nosocomial outbreaks in Jos and Zorzor were instances of pure human-to-human chains. This is a message too important to be neglected. Despite some improvement in the implementation of barrier nursing in hospital structures, there is no evidence that in the last decades prophylactic measures have significantly changed in ordinary situations as in households and villages, and this issue has been abundantly clear during the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa. It is therefore reasonable that chains of human-to-human transmission, like the extra-nosocomial outbreak that occurred in Jos more than 40 years ago are much more common than expected.\n\nThis study highlights the need for integrated One Health approaches to model zoonoses more effectively in order to better-inform disease control and prevention. Zoonoses remain a neglected group of diseases, under-prioritised in national and international health systems."}
