They were then mixed with a 10 mL of milk, homogenized and incorporated in 142 0.49 L of MR (0.5 g/calf at morning meal and 0.5 g/calf at afternoon meal) to ensure 143 total ingestion of the product. After ingesting 0.5 L MR with 0.5 g of the blend of 144 essential oils, the rest of the meal was given.\n\n145 \n\nThe analysis of each outcome was performed independently of all others using 286 linear mixed models (package: nlme). Each independent outcome was modeled as a 287 function of the following fixed effects: treatment, experimental week, the interaction 288 between treatment and week. Birth weight and serum Brix refractometer were tested as 289 a covariate but did not improve statistical significance. Therefore they were eliminated 290 from the model. The genetic composition of the animal was included as a blocking 291 effect. The effect of heifer within treatment was included in the models to account for 292 individual variability.\n\nThe continuous outcomes such as intakes, performance, ruminal and blood 294 parameters were analyzed with ANOVA. A 95% Confidence Interval was adopted to 295 accept or deny the null hypothesis and P-values were produced with a Fisher test.

A 301 95% Confidence Interval was also adopted for the non-parametric tests.\n\n303 Results and discussion 304 Intake and heifer performance 305 Most studies evaluating essential oils or a supplement with BEO to dairy calves, 306 feed the additive in the starter, to benefit rumen development and accelerate growth.\n\n307 However, the intake of starter in the firsts weeks of age is small (23). Due to the calf's 308 limited capability of ingesting large solid feed amounts in the first days of life, the 309 supplement intake could be compromised during pre-weaning period and possibly mask 310 any effects. Therefore, in this trial, it was decided to offer BEO in the liquid diet.\n\nThe tested BEO has a strong aroma. Nevertheless, due to the way it was offered, 312 no rejection of the mixture BEO and MR was observed. The supplemented heifers 313 consumed liquid diet equally to the control treatment, with no refusal and good 314 acceptance (Table 2 ). Some essential oils have different acceptability by animals.\n\n315 Chapman et al. (24) testing cinnamaldehyde essential oil in weaned dairy heifers fed a 316 total mix ratio, observed that the animals preferred the taste in the control treatment, and 317 the modification of feed intake was related to problems of palatability with the essential 318 oil used in the experiment. Differences between flavor and palatability of BEOs could 319 be due to the way of supply, as well as to essential oil plant source.\n\n. CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

Differences 331 between treatments were greater in those weeks when compared with the other weeks, 332 with lower intake for CON group. It was found an effect between fecal scores and MR 333 intake (P \u2264 0.001), besides low correlation value (-0.25). Thus, results reveled an 334 inverse association between both parameters, were greater fecal scores impacted on 335 smaller MR intake, and vice versa. Intake of starter, water, total DM, CP, and gross energy, ADG and feed efficiency 342 were not affected by treatment during pre-and post-weaning (Table 2 and (Table 3) 355 during pre and post-weaning. As was also observed for intake and ADG, a week effect Table 4 ). Since there were no differences between treatments during pre-375 weaning, the carryover effect may not be assumed to be the answer for this difference.\n\n376 Although no differences on intake were observed, heifers' ingestion behavior might 377 justify the difference in post-weaning pH. However, this parameter was not evaluated.\n\n378 Nevertheless, previous studies with essential oils supplementation also found low pH 379 values for pre-weaning calves, but no essential oils treatment effect (16,25,27). 19 392 VFA. Possibly, for that reason, a low pH is frequently found in pre-weaning calves.\n\n393 Therefore, acidosis has not been reported at this phase, since calves can stand lower 394 rumen pH values when compared to adult ruminants (23).\n\nBesides the previous cited effects, essential oils supplementation is related to 396 antimicrobial and antifungal effects (9,28). Essential oils cause hydrophobicity, \n\nDespite this, in this study, VFA concentrations were not affected by BEO 420 supplementation during pre-and post-weaning, but increased with age (P \u2264 0.05, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.995209 doi: bioRxiv preprint 22 456 (5,33). However, since there were changes in C2:C3 proportion in BEO group, the 457 increase of propionic acid could consequently impact on glucose blood concentration.\n\n458 Since essential oils can increase of insulin sensitivity, not finding glucose differences 459 between treatments does not mean that there were no changes in glucose pathway.\n\n460 Therefore, further investigations over theses aspects is needed.\n\nAll blood cells count were within age and specie normality. According to Benesi Evaluation of the respiratory score parameters indicated that 2 BEO animals and 1 549 of CON animals exceeded score 4, indicating respiratory disease on pre-weaning. The 550 average days with high score was 1.0 \u00b1 0 d for BEO. No effect was found on days with 551 high respiratory score or number of affected animals. However, it was observed a week 552 and an interaction week x treatment effect on pre-weaning, with difference between 553 treatments scores and lower values for BEO group in week 2 (P \u2264 0.05, Table 7 , Fig 1) .\n\n554\n\nWeek 2 was the period in which animals had higher incidence of diarrhea. Thus, it can 555 be assumed that respiratory signs were related to previous enteric disease since a higher 556 incidence of respiratory parameters occurred after diarrhea cases. Weeks 5 and 6 557 showed lower score differeces between treatments as well as lower incidence of 558 respiratory signs. The number of treated animals was 2 for BEO only during the 559 preweaning period, with an average of treatment days of 1.3 \u00b1 1.4, and 3 for CON with 560 an average of treatment days of 2.0 \u00b1 0.57. Treatments occurred only in the pre-weaning 561 period using antibiotics and anti-inflammatories.\n\nPneumonia is normally associated to the post-weaning phase. However, it may 563 affect younger calves to have it (2). Post-weaning respiratory scores revealed higher 564 mean values, but no animals had scores above 4. There was a week effect (P \u2264 0.05), in 565 week 12, probably due to weaning and dehorning stress.\n\nIt has been reported that essential oils have an antiseptic and antimicrobial activity 567 that may be beneficial in balancing intestinal microbiota (43). Gram positive bacteria 568 are the most sensitive to the essential oils microbial activity (7,12), but it is possible that 569 gram negative bacteria and some types of parasites are also susceptible (9) to different 570 essential oils. Thus, essential oils could reduce the incidence and severity of diarrhea 571 syndrome in calves trough inhibition of coliform overgrowth (44). BEO in 1.0 \u00b5g/mL 572 concentration did not inhibit bacterial growth -both E. coli and S. tryphimurium. Thus, . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

However, 574 besides no direct influence found over the bacterial evaluation, BEO calves presented 575 differences on basophil (Table 6 ) and lymphocyte cell populations (Fig 2) which could 576 be associated to modulation of inflammatory immune response. Thus, outcomes found 577 on fecal and respiratory scores could be associated to indirect changes in hemato-578 biochemical parameters since essential oils have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory 579 effect. Feeding BEO to pre-weaned heifers on MR did not affect intake, performance 583 parameters, blood metabolites or IGF-1 concentration. However, it changed C2:C3 584 proportion during pre-and post-weaning periods, as well as showed signs of immunity 585 improvement and lower fecal scores in the pre-weaning phase. Further research is 586 needed to define the best rout and dosage as well as understand the essential oils 587 contribution on decrease morbidity of neonatal diseases. Therefore, essential oils are a 588 health additive option to modern production sytems, and could be used as an alternative 589 to improve calf health and performance. "}
