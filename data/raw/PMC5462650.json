{"title": "Human\u2013livestock contacts and their relationship to transmission of zoonotic pathogens, a systematic review of literature", "body": "Zoonotic infectious diseases \u2013 diseases transmitted from vertebrate animals to humans \u2013 account for an estimated 60% of all human infectious diseases [1]. The rise of zoonotic diseases in humans began after the introduction of agriculture and the domestication of animals when humans started living in large numbers together, in close contact with other vertebrate animals [2], [3]. Nowadays, livestock associated infectious diseases are still a major threat to human health, as recently illustrated by the outbreak of pig origin H1N1 influenza A pandemic in 2009 or the emergence of camel-origin Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus [4], [5], [6]. The occurrence of a zoonotic disease may lead to large economic losses in the agricultural sector [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. When it comes to recent emerging infectious diseases, zoonoses again account for the majority of the newly introduced infectious diseases to the human population. Although zoonoses with a wildlife origin dominate among emerging pathogens, livestock associated zoonotic diseases occur mainly in densely human populated areas in the world [15] and can therefore have a considerable public health impact. In developing countries humans often live close to their livestock [16], [17], [18]; in developed countries there are mainly occupational contacts with large numbers of live [19], ill [20] or dead animals [21], [22], [23], [24], but there are also reports of micro-organism transmissions via the environment [25], [26] or after brief contact [27], [28].\n\nContact with livestock animals can lead to transmission of micro-organisms by inhalation, ingestion, via conjunctiva, or during incidents such as biting or other injuries inflicted by animals [29]. Furthermore, aerosols contaminated with micro-organisms from respiratory [30], [31], [32], [33], [34] or fluid sources [35], can play an important role in the transmission of micro-organisms between humans [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], but also from animals to humans. Aerosols have been suggested to play a role in micro-organism transmission over very short distances, sometimes as a parallel route to direct contact [30]. It is thus clear that for transmission of zoonotic diseases to occur, the presence of animals or some type of contact with (livestock-) animals is crucial. Initiatives to control livestock-associated zoonotic diseases are already in place, as reviewed by Zinnstag et al. [36] and others [37], [38]. However, better understanding of contact patterns driving micro-organism transmission from animals to humans is needed to provide options for prevention and thus deserves more attention. Therefore, in this study we reviewed current literature on livestock-associated zoonotic diseases, to evaluate current knowledge regarding human\u2013livestock contact patterns. We conducted a systematic review to identify papers reporting on livestock-related zoonoses. We searched the publications regarding reports of contact patterns between livestock animals and humans that led to a transmission of infectious diseases or micro-organisms from livestock to man.\n\nWe searched EMBASE and Medline for reports on livestock associated (LA) zoonoses combined with human\u2013livestock interactions. Our search terms and selection steps are given in Appendix A. We also scrutinised references of the included publications. Publications until the 22nd of September 2014 were included.\n\nWe included publications reporting on zoonoses from livestock animals, human\u2013livestock contacts, human\u2013livestock contacts and infectious disease transmission, and in case of multiple human LA-zoonosis case reports, exact DNA matches between livestock and human isolates. Peer-reviewed, original research in English, Dutch or German language was included.\n\nWe excluded articles describing; vector borne diseases, experimental laboratory studies, xenotransplantation-related diseases, reports on diseases with livestock as a dead-end host (e.g. Rabies, Schistosomiasis, Malaria, and Trypanosoma), papers evaluating diseases linked to wildlife hosts (e.g. bat-related and primate (bushmeat)-related diseases), as well as papers discussing food related zoonosis outbreaks. These articles were excluded because these zoonotic pathogens, are not transmitted through direct contact between livestock and humans.\n\nSelected papers were either articles or articles in press, other publication types were removed from the selection. Titles and abstracts of retrieved publications were evaluated regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria by GK together with RAC.\n\nWith respect to contact with infected animals, veterinarians and veterinary medicine students have an increased risk of acquiring infections. Veterinarians are the first people who come in contact with infected animals in case of an outbreak [39]. They are at increased risk to acquire a wide range of zoonotic infections, as was illustrated in a study among veterinarians from South-Africa [20]. In Denmark, 36% of veterinarians and 11% of other occupationally exposed people in contact with dairy cattle were found positive for serological markers of C. burnetii; these markers are indicative of (previous-) infection after exposure to infected animals [40]. Seroconversion for C. burnetii was found in 18.7% of students whom provided a blood sample in the study of De Rooij et al. A clear exposure\u2013response relationship was found for the prevalence of converted sera which increased with every year the students advanced in their education within the study specialisation \u2018farm animals\u2019 [41]. In 44% of a cohort of Dutch veterinarians, LA-MRSA carriage was found on at least one of the repetitive measuring moments, 13% of all participants were persistent carriers of LA-MRSA. This makes MRSA carriage among veterinarians extremely high, because in the general Dutch population MRSA carriage is very rare (< 0.1%) [42]. In veterinary medicine students MRSA carriage was detected after contact with MRSA carrying horses [43].\n\nAfter the first cases of a zoonotic outbreak are identified [39], control measure sometimes consists of the culling of the entire flock or herd on the affected farm. Cullers are usually equipped with personal protective equipment and receive personal hygiene instructions, although it has been shown that such measures can reduce exposure, but are not fully protective [44], [45]. Secondary cases among contacts of cullers can also occur, as reported after a large outbreak of H7N7 Avian Influenza in Dutch poultry farms in 2003 [46]. After this outbreak, risk factors for the acquisition [39] and transmission [47] of an infection were \u2018clinical inspection of poultry in the area surrounding infected flocks\u2019 [39], [47], and \u2018active culling during depopulation\u2019 [39]. A more quantitative relationship was reported by Whelan et al. during the large Q-fever outbreak in the Netherlands between 2007 and 2009 [48]. In cullers working on Q-fever infected goat farms, an exposure-response-like relationship between the \u2018total number of hours worked inside the farm perimeter\u2019 and \u2018working mostly inside stables\u2019 and the risk of seroconversion for C. burnetii markers was discovered [48].\n\nThe most relevant observations in this occupational group are the exposure\u2013response relationships for micro-organism carriage or transmission found in slaughterhouse personnel, in particular those individuals in close contact with live animals [21], [22], [23], [24]. Four reports, three addressing MRSA and one C. psittaci, in both pig and poultry slaughterhouses, demonstrated clear relationships between the position of the workers on the slaughter line and carriage of micro-organisms or occurrence of disease [21], [22], [23], [24]. This was supported by evidence for both temporal and spatial variations for micro-organism levels in air, on gloves and surface contamination. Temporal, because during the day an increase of MRSA and C. psittaci environmental levels were shown [22], [24]. Spatial, because people at the start of the slaughter line working with live animals, were more often found to be carriers of MRSA, compared to people only working with carcasses [21], [22], [23], [24].\n\nThat living animals were the main risk factor for carriage or infections with micro-organisms was also shown by Myers et al.: they reported that farmers showed the highest Swine Influenza H1N1 specific titres in their blood, compared to a pool of veterinarians, control subjects and slaughterhouse workers [49].\n\nScott et al. found no relationship between antibiotic resistance patterns of E. coli isolated from pigs and isolates from slaughterhouse workers [50]. However, S. aureus isolates carried by slaughterhouse workers were found to be more extensively resistant to antibiotics compared to community controls [51]. An increased risk for Hepatitis E virus infection in people occupationally exposed to pigs was found, especially for slaughterhouse workers [52]. Also, meat-processing workers had been more often infected with avian Metapneumovirus compared to controls [53].\n\nFarmers face daily exposure to LA-micro-organisms in every aspect of their work. Still, it is very hard to determine which activity leads to transmission of micro-organisms. In this group, outbreaks are often investigated in a retrospective way, i.e. by performing serological epidemiology, analysing blood samples for antibodies against specific pathogens. This procedure does not allow distinguishing between past and more recent transmission events.\n\nIn the Netherlands, antibodies against C. burnetii were found in 73.5% of blood samples from farmers keeping dairy goats [54]. In an Italian study, animal workers were checked for blood markers against C. burnetii, Leptospira spp. and Brucella spp. Only for C. burnetii a higher sero-prevalence of 73.4% was found in animal workers, compared with 13.6% in controls [55]. For the evaluation of Hepatitis E virus, these links were not as clear as for Q-fever: serological epidemiology in a farmer cohort in the United Kingdom showed high Hepatitis E virus sero-positivity, but pig contact was not found to represent a risk factor [56]. In another study from Germany, however, increased Hepatitis E virus positivity in people with contact with pigs was shown, compared to age- and gender-matched controls [52].\n\nThe literature is also inconsistent for Avian Influenza. One study from the US indicated no human antibody sero-positivity of Avian Influenza subtypes prevalent in poultry among poultry workers [57], while other studies from the US and Italy did show similar Avian Influenza subtypes in poultry and poultry workers [58], [59], [60]. Evidence from Hong Kong even indicated an exposure\u2013response-like relationship for H5N1 Avian Influenza transmission: more anti-H5 antibodies were found in poultry workers with more poultry-related tasks compared to community controls. Direct contact to poultry and butchering poultry was identified as risk factors carrying the highest infection risk [61]. For Swine Influenza studies are consistent, three studies reported serological antibody presence against swine influenza in pig farmers and workers [49], [62], [63]. Remarkably, the study of De Marco et al. reported cross-protective immunity against the 2009 human pandemic Influenza A in swine workers exposed to pigs and Swine Influenza [63].\n\nOther research in farmers mainly focussed on antimicrobial-resistant zoonotic organism carriage. These studies often have a different design, utilising cross-sectional or cohort designs, occasionally with repeated measurements. LA-MRSA [64] can be transmitted between animal species [65] and from animals to humans [65], [66], [67], [68], but also from animals to the farm environment, although the host preferences differ [65], [69]. One study identified a correlation between the carriage prevalence in pigs and the likelihood of human LA-MRSA carriage [70]. Still, the prevalence of persistent LA-MRSA carriage among farmers is relatively low [71] and most individuals show relatively rapid clearing of LA-MRSA carriage [19], [66]. In poultry farms, MRSA positivity was found to be less prevalent compared to veal calf and pig farms. This could explain the limited carriage in poultry workers [72] and among people who keep poultry at home [73]. In addition, the reverse transmission route has also been proposed, with the evidence for a reverse zoonosis/anthroponosis being pigs positive for healthcare associated-MRSA, thus indicating farmer-to-pig MRSA spread [74]. This theory is enhanced by evidence showing that LA-MRSA is less transmissible between people, compared to other MRSA types [75].\n\nEspecially in developing countries, transmission of micro-organisms can occur from live animals or via blood products from slaughtering practises within the home setting, but the actual transmission pathways are often unknown. In these countries livestock keeping is common practise for many families and animals are frequently kept in the home backyard for egg, milk or meat production [16], [17], [76], [77], [78], [79], [80], [18], [81], [82], [83], [84], [85]. Backyard poultry keeping has been linked to Avian Influenza transmission on many occasions. This was found by Thornson et al. performing interviews in Vietnam, asking for poultry contact and flulike illness [77], modelled by Van Kerkhove et al. in Cambodia after interviewing people regarding their poultry contacts [78], and shown among Egyptian women by Kandeel and colleagues performing a risk factor analysis of all suspected Avian Influenza cases in Egypt [80].\n\nChina knows a broad diversity in livestock farming practises, ranging from poultry farming with people involved in all stages of the production cycle [86], to large industrially managed cattle herds [87]. In both of these situations zoonotic disease transmissions have been described from livestock to humans, Avian Influenza and T. verricosum, respectively [86], [87]. In summary, literature to date is not informative regarding which livestock\u2013human contact pattern leads to zoonotic disease transmission in developing countries.\n\nIn some instances, very brief exposure may be sufficient for transmission of micro-organisms, especially when the infectious dose of a pathogen is very low [88]. This was shown in Germany in a study focussing on LA-MRSA carriage among farmers and residents in an area with a high density of livestock farms. Farmers were mainly at risk when they had pig contact, but the authors also found that regular visits to farms \u2013 e.g. to buy eggs or milk \u2013 increased the chance of becoming a LA-MRSA carrier among non-farm residents [89]. In Turkey, preparing freshly slaughtered sheep led to transmission of Orf virus during the feast of sacrifice, an Islamic tradition, among non-occupationally exposed people [90]. Visits to an agricultural fair in the US resulted in transmission of Swine Influenza between displayed pigs and human visitors [27]. Visitors of a pedagogical farm in France were reported to be infected with Q-fever [28] and gastrointestinal infections with VTEC O157 occurred on a farm open to the public in the UK [91]. VTEC O157 infections were also observed among \u2018holidaymakers\u2019, \u2018farm visitors\u2019, \u2018farming families\u2019 and \u2018farm workers\u2019 [92]. Still, the actual pathway of an infection was not specifically ascertained in most papers. This was illustrated by an outbreak of C. parvum among children camping on an adventure farm in the UK [93].\n\nThis section summarises reports where people indicated that they had no direct contact to livestock animals, but experienced adverse-health effects due to livestock in their immediate surroundings. These articles indicated that close contact to livestock animals was not necessary for a transmission event to occur, but that already living in close vicinity of livestock could be enough for the occurrence of adverse health effects among residents.\n\nRespiratory health can be affected by many sources, including livestock farming in the vicinity of a residence. In Germany, reduced respiratory health of residents was linked to the presence of Confined Animal Feeding Operations, industrially managed livestock stables, near their home address. Although these studies did not focus on infectious diseases, they did indicate effects of livestock keeping on the health of nearby residents [94], [95]. In a Dutch study investigating LA-MRSA presence in a rural population, only direct animal contact was found as a risk factor [96]. When the Danish national human MRSA database was checked for a livestock-associated MecC resistance gene, this was mainly found in samples from people living in rural parts of the country and animal contact was an important risk factor. Still, the gene was also discovered in human MRSA samples from people living in rural areas, but having no livestock contact [97]. An attempt to identify risk factors for Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae carriage among people living in high- and low-poultry density areas in the Netherlands showed no elevated risk between the distance of positive poultry farms from the home and ESBL carriage of residents [98]. For Q-fever, however, the link between living close to infected farms and human cases of the disease is well established [25], [26], [88]. In the Netherlands, a large outbreak occurred in recent years and an exposure\u2013response-like relationship was found for the number of goats within 5 km of the home address and human cases [26]. In Germany, a specific flock of sheep could even be identified as the source of a human Q-fever outbreak in a village [99]. In Italy, where in some areas free-range sheep herding is still common practise, the passing of three flocks of infected sheep through a village led to an outbreak of Q-fever [100].\n\nAlthough, we found a significant body of evidence that described zoonotic transmissions of micro-organisms, little is known about the intensity and type of contact patterns leading to transmission, and thus the exact transmission pathways of micro-organisms from livestock to humans usually remains unclear. Human\u2013livestock contacts were merely implicitly cited in the literature, and commonly, contact intensity was defined by the occupational status of the person carrying or infected with a LA-micro-organism. Studies performed in an occupational setting provided some evidence of exposure response relationships between the intensity of livestock\u2013human contacts and the transmission of micro-organisms. Using methods that are already in place in the exposure assessment sciences [110], exposure to LA-zoonotic micro-organisms through contact patterns between livestock and humans, can be better quantified both in the occupational and the non-occupational setting. This will be crucial in the development of effective interventions to prevent transmission of micro-organisms from livestock to humans.\n\nGK, AH, DJJH and RAC designed the study, GK wrote the paper, GK and RAC reviewed the selected papers, AH, DJJH and RAC revised it critically for important intellectual content.
