{"title": "Development and Evaluation of A CRISPR-based Diagnostic For 2019-novel Coronavirus", "body": "Since the beginning of 2020, a surging number of pneumonia caused by infections of a novel 56 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have been identified in China, especially Wuhan, a metropolitan 57 city with a population of over 10 million. [1, 2] In recent days, the outbreak has affected 58 multiple countries and caused worldwide impact. The epidemic of 2019-nCoV was first discovered by metagenomic next-generation 69 sequencing (mNGS) in which the novel virus was found to be a new pathogenic member of 70 the betacoronavirus genus but shared only about 79% in genetic similarity with SARS. [8, 9] 71 Currently, metagenomics and RT-PCR are two molecular approaches most commonly used 72 diagnostics for this novel virus. [13, 14] However, the diagnostic performance of different 73 molecular methods have not been investigated. 74 All rights reserved.

The copy number concentration was then calculated based the weight and the 157 length of fragment. Serial dilution with nuclease-free water was done to achieve desired 158 concentrations. 2.5\u03bcl of extracted DNA at each titer was used as templates. Ten replicates 159 were performed at each data point near detection limit. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is 191 We seek to develop a rapid, highly sensitive and simple-to-use assay by taking advantage 192 of both the polymerase-mediated DNA amplification by RPA and the CRISPR/Cas-mediated 193 enzymatic signal amplification for improved sensitivity (Figure 2A) .

Among these, the set that targeted Orf1ab 198 showed the best overall performance of sensitivity and specificity, and therefore, was used to 199 develop CRISPR-nCoV in this study for further evaluation (data not shown). 200 We then sought to determine its analytical sensitivity by serial dilution at various 201 concentrations. As shown in Figure 2B , CRISPR-nCoV consistently detected 7.5 copies of 202 2019-nCoV in all 10 replicates, 2.5 copies in 6 out of 10 , and 1.25 copies in 2 out of 10 runs.\n\nThese data indicate that CRISPR-nCoV had a near single-copy sensitivity. To confirm its 204 specificity, we tested CRISPR-nCoV with DNA from human cells as well as a panel of the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.22.20025460 doi: medRxiv preprint 1 opportunity to take advantage of both the sensitivity of an isothermal assay and the specificity 279 of the CRISPR system.\n\n[21] As we demonstrated in this study, CRISPR-nCoV was able to 280 deliver comparable sensitivity and specificity as mNGS within as short as 40 minutes. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is "}
