{"title": "Risk factors for multidrug-resistant pathogens in bronchiectasis exacerbations", "body": "Multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens are a worldwide health threat with clinical negative consequences if inadequately recognized and treated. Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (BE) is a chronic structural lung condition that facilitates chronic colonization by microorganisms and courses with frequent exacerbations and recurrent infections. [1, 2] This means that patients receive numerous courses with broad-spectrum antibiotics, making them more likely to acquire MDR pathogens.\n\nThe main pathogens involved in chronic colonization and acute exacerbations are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and, to a lesser extent, Enterobacteriaceae. The incidence and spread of MDR microorganisms among BE patients is worrisome because the antibiotic arsenal is scarce and the most threatening potential MDR pathogens in respiratory patients include P. aeruginosa and extended-spectrum betalactamase (ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae. These pathogens are difficult to treat because they require different antibiotic regimens to those usually recommended in guidelines.\n\nTo our knowledge, no prospective studies have been aimed at identifying independent risk factors for MDR pathogens in BE exacerbations. [3, 4] We hypothesized that MDR exacerbations depend on patient characteristics, including usual treatments and prior health contacts, and that knowledge of these factors may be useful for reducing inappropriate antibiotic treatment.\n\nThe aim of our study was to investigate risk factors associated with isolation of multi-drug resistant microorganisms in bronchiectasis exacerbations and their clinical impact on outcome.\n\nData collected were demographic, diagnosis of BE, smoking, alcohol abuse and flu vaccine status. Comorbidities were also recorded (diabetes, COPD, asthma, heart disease, prior tuberculosis, renal, liver and cerebrovascular diseases) and age-adjusted Charlson score. [6] Data related to prior microorganisms isolation, number of exacerbations in the previous year, bronchiectasis severity scores (BSI, FACED) [7, 8] were also recorded. Chronic and concomitant medication included bronchodilators, corticosteroids, theophylline, inhaled/nebulized antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, long-term oxygen therapy and mucolytic drugs. A history of prior exacerbations and hospitalization during the previous year were also detailed.\n\nThe definition of exacerbation according to Spanish guidelines [5] was as follows: acute change in sputum characteristics (increased volume, change of viscosity, purulence) with or without increased dyspnea after ruling out any other causes along with the requirement of a new antibiotic treatment prescribed in our specific clinic and / or unscheduled admission to hospital. We included also exacerbations with new chest x-ray infiltrates diagnosed as pneumonia. The attending physician made the decision to admit to hospital. During the exacerbation episode, data collected were change of initial antibiotic, complications, invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Length of hospital stay was recorded in hospitalized patients and new exacerbations at 1 year of follow-up. Inappropriate antibiotic treatment was considered when pathogens were not susceptible to the prescribed antibiotic with respect to in vitro susceptibility testing. Patients were followed up for visits in the specialized clinic at 30 days, 90 days and 1 year after discharge.\n\nThe microbiological diagnosis was performed with the following tests: sputum (208 patients), urine antigen test for S. pneumoniae (126) and L. pneumophila (128), two blood samples (87) and nasopharyngeal swabs (125) (for influenza A and B, parainfluenzae, syncytial respiratory virus, adenovirus). Sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (11) were processed for Gram and Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stains and for cultures of bacterial, fungal and mycobacterial pathogens. Sputum samples were considered acceptable if there were more than 25 leukocytes and fewer than 10 squamous cells per low-power microscope field. Invasive samples were obtained if requested by the attending physician. Microorganism identification was consider positive as in previous publications. [9] Briefly, bacterial identification was achieved by means of the MALDI-TOF MS (Biomerieux, Marcy l\u2019Etoile, France). Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique on Muller-Hinton or sheep blood agar, depending on the microorganism growth requirements; E-test and in-house PCR were used to assess unexpected resistance patterns.\n\n\nConcept of Multidrug resistant pathogens (MDR)  [10] MDR pathogens were classified according to European Centre of Diseases Prevention and Control: P. aeruginosa was considered MDR if non susceptible to at least 1 agent in 3 or more antimicrobial categories; MRSA was defined when S aureus was resistant to oxacillin corresponding to a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of \u22654 mcg/mL. Enterobacteriaceae was defined as ESBL+ when they presented resistance to most \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, including penicillin, cephalosporins and aztreonam.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software program 20.0. Qualitative variables were compared using the \u03c72 test. Quantitative variables were analyzed using the ANOVA test or the Kruskal-Wallis test. Values of p \u22640.05 were considered statistically significant. Length of stay was dichotomized as short (\u2264 7 days) or long stay. FACED and BSI were dichotomized as severe (\u2265 5 and \u22659 points respectively) and not severe.\n\nLogistic regression analyses were performed to predict MDR pathogens as the dependent variable. Independent variables included were those found in the univariate analysis with p < 0.1. Variables that were highly correlated were excluded from the analysis. The subset of patients with non-MDR pathogens was used as the reference group. A second logistic regression analysis was also performed using as the reference group patients with non-MDR pathogens and patients without etiological diagnosis. The Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was used to evaluate the adequacy of the models. [11] The areas under the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were also calculated.\n\nWe recruited 233 patients with one exacerbation and microbial isolation was found in 159 of them (Fig. 1). Characteristics of patients, BE diagnosis, previous microorganisms isolations, number of exacerbations, number of prior antibiotic treatments, usual concomitant medications and severity scores are described in Table 1.\n\n\n\nThe most frequent pathogens found during exacerbation are described in Table 2. MDR pathogens isolated during an exacerbation were found in 32 out of 241 microorganism, representing 13.2% of all microorganisms isolated: 16 (50%) MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 (18.7%) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 2 (6.2%) extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (Proteus mirabilis and Serratia marcescens) and 8 other bacteria (2 Achromobacter xylosoxidans, 2 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 1 Brevundimonas diminuta, 1 MDR Escherichia coli not ESBL, 1 Haemophilus influenzae ESBL and 1 MDR Mycobacterium abscessus).\n\n\nPatients who required admission were more likely to grow MDR organisms than those who did not require admission (27/153 vs 5/80, p:0.016)(Fig. 1). Antibiotics initially prescribed for the exacerbation were changed in 37/159 patients, this occurred more frequently in those with MDR pathogens without reaching statistical significance (31.2% vs. 21.3%, p:0.23). In Table 3, there is depicted the outcome of exacerbations with regard to isolation MDR pathogens and patients without isolation are not included.\n\n\nCharacteristics of patients, comorbid conditions, usual treatments, and scores regarding the presence or absence of MDR are shown in Table 1. Exacerbations were recorded and 153 of these patients were hospital admitted. MDR pathogens were more frequently encountered in patients with more chronic conditions and in those with higher FACED and BSI scores. No differences were found concerning usual prior treatments. Patients with prior hospitalization showed a significantly more frequent incidence of MDR.\n\nThree independent predictors to MDR exacerbations were identified. The area under the ROC curve for the model was 0.767 (95% CI, 0.669\u20130.865) (Table 4). In the second model using as a reference group patients with non-MDR pathogens and those without etiological diagnosis, these risk factors remained independently associated with MDR bacteria.\n\n\nThe presence of MDR in exacerbations with regard to the number of recognized risk factors found is shown in Fig. 2. No risk factors were identified in 102 patients and the probability of MDR in these patients was 3.9%. This probability increases to 12.6% when there is 1 risk factor and to 53.6% if 2 or more risk factors are present in total cohort.\n\n\nPathogen identification relied mainly on conventional microbiological tests and invasive respiratory samples were only indicated if required by the attending physician; this is a real clinical scenario common in clinical hospital settings. No quantitative bacteriology measuring with colony counts was quantified in sputum. Due to the number of patients in the cohort, a secondary analysis to separate specific risk factors for each microorganism was not undertaken. Mild episodes of exacerbations treated in primary care and not evaluated in our specific clinics were not included.\n\nThis is the first study aimed at identifying risk factors for MDR exacerbations with potential impact on clinical decisions for antibiotic choice. At present, BTS guidelines [28] suggest combination therapy rather than single-drug antibiotic therapy if a resistant strain of P aeruginosa is isolated. Our findings could be useful for avoiding unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients without MDR risk factors.\n\nOur findings have identified three independent risk factors - hospitalization in the previous year, chronic renal disease, and prior multidrug-resistant isolation- for identification multidrug-resistant pathogens in BE exacerbations. This information may be useful for clinicians in guiding initial antibiotic therapy in exacerbations of BE. A further validation in different BE cohorts including distinct phenotypes and larger follow-up periods should be performed. MDR risk prediction in BE exacerbations is a new field that requires validation for clinical decision-making in selecting initial appropriate antibiotics and for safely avoiding anti-MDR coverage."}
