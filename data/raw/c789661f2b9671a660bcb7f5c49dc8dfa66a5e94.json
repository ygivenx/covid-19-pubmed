{"title": "on behalf of the Periostin Study Team", "body": "in comparison with the intraparticipant variance of 15.3, as shown in sequential Bland-Altman plots in Fig E1 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org. This is consistent with low variability of periostin levels within subjects in a clinical sample representing a well-controlled adult asthmatic population. The 95% CI for individual predictions of periostin levels were plus or minus 7.7 ng/mL. The mean coefficient of variation for periostin for the 60 participants was 6.3% (95% CI, 5.7% to 7.0%). There was no evidence of monthly (P 5 .56, see Table  E4 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org) or seasonal (P 5.90 . see Table E5 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org) variation between participants. Five participants had a severe asthma exacerbation during the study and required systemic corticosteroids (Fig 2) with a mean dose of 35 mg/d (range, 20-60 mg/d; courses lasting from 1-16 days; see Table E6 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). The mixed linear model estimate of the difference in periostin levels between the first measurement after a severe exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids and the pre-exacerbation measurements for these 5 participants was 25.4 ng/mL (95% CI, 28.3 to 22.6 ng/mL; P 5 .002). The difference in periostin levels between the postexacerbation and pre-exacerbation levels was 24.5 ng/mL (95% CI, 27.0 to 21.9 ng/mL [P < .001]; which is smaller than the 95% CI for an individual prediction of periostin levels).\n\nIn summary, we found little variability in periostin measurements within subjects over an 8-week period. The within-participant variance was 15.3, with a 95% CI for periostin levels of 67.7 ng/mL. These findings in adults receiving step 4 treatment according to Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines 9 are consistent with those of studies performed in populations with severe asthma over a period of 2 4 and 5 1 weeks, respectively. These studies reported a coefficient of variation rather than variance components, with point estimates of 5.0% and 5.3%, respectively. This is consistent with the low intraparticipant variability in periostin measurements observed in this study, in which the coefficient of variation was 6.3%. We found no evidence of a monthly or seasonal fluctuation in serum periostin levels between participants who were recruited over a 12-month period. Therefore it might not be necessary to consider seasonality when assessing periostin levels in candidates for treatment with the novel asthma biologic therapies. Periostin levels are modestly reduced by systemic corticosteroid treatment of a severe asthma exacerbation, but the effect lies within the level of variation expected in otherwise stable adults with asthma.\n\nIn conclusion, we propose that the stability of periostin measurements supports its use as a biomarker in asthmatic patients, predicting responsiveness to biologic therapy directed against type 2 disease.\n\nonly once: a 9-year-old boy with nonsevere skin and lung infections had a homozygous intronic mutation producing a novel splice acceptor site, resulting in predominant expression of a frame-shifted mutant protein but with residual levels of wild-type (WT) protein. 6 Recently, a sibling pair manifesting only early-onset autoimmune diseases, without opportunistic infections, was shown to be compound heterozygous for a hypoactive allele and a weakly hyperactive allele; the specific combination of these paired alleles was required for disease. 7 Collectively, these cases show that residual levels of functional protein regulate the clinical phenotype of ZAP-70 deficiency. It further suggests that, in distinction to null alleles, different therapeutic approaches may be needed for ''leaky'' mutations that permit survival beyond the typical time frame and for whom hematopoietic stem cell transplant at older age may be associated with excess risk. 8 We expand the clinical phenotype of hypomorphic ZAP-70 deficiency and provide proof-of-concept that mutation-targeted therapy can improve immune function.\n\nWe identified a 33-year-old male (P1) born from consanguineous Coptic parents (see Fig E1, A, in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). An older brother died at 16 months from suspected viral encephalitis; an older sister and parents were well. P1 had a history of failure to thrive, adrenal insufficiency, and inflammatory enterocolitis starting in infancy, recurrent respiratory tract infections starting at 9 months, and intermittent mucocutaneous candidiasis, recurrent herpes simplex virus stomatitis, and varicella-zoster virus infections 3 times. Investigations at the time revealed a visible thymus, normal immunoglobulin isotypes with poor response to vaccines, and persistent CD8 1 lymphocytopenia (1% to 3% of total T cells age-adjusted reference range). Beginning at approximately 3 years of age, serial testing demonstrated increasing proportion of CD8 1 T cells (8% to 10% of total lymphocytes). Further investigations were suggestive of ZAP-70 deficiency (Fig E1,  B and C). However, a reference laboratory reported identifying no mutation in ZAP70. Thus, bone marrow transplantation was not pursued. IgA nephropathy at age 16 years eventually required renal transplant from his mother at age 30 years. The subsequent years were marked by EBV viremia/lymphoproliferative disorder (with recurrence of viremia ;6 months after completing rituximab), cytomegalovirus viremia (with recurrence following cessation of (val)ganciclovir), polyomaviremia (BK and JC viruses), and epidermodysplasia verruciformis-like lesions (due to human papilloma virus-23) (see Fig E2 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org), which prompted reevaluation for an underlying immunodeficiency. He is currently aged 35 years, on immunoglobulin replacement for respiratory tract infection prophylaxis, and his viral infections are managed conservatively.\n\nWhole-exome sequencing revealed no known etiology for the immunodeficiency, other than a homozygous c.1272C>T variant in ZAP70 (NM_001079; hg19). The germline c.1272C>T variant, while synonymous (p.G355G), is predicted in silico (Human Splicing Finder) to create a novel donor splice site within exon 9 (DSS mut ) that is stronger than the native junctional one (DSS wt ) (Fig 1, A) . This new splice site is predicted to create a 19-bp deleted product with a premature stop codon in exon 10. Sanger sequencing confirmed the homozygous c.1272C>T variant in P1; the unaffected family members were heterozygous (Fig 1, B) . RT-PCR from P1's PBMCs confirmed the predicted splicing effect, demonstrating a predominant mutant isoform with trace levels of WT isoform (Fig 1, C and D) . The heterozygous family members possessed both isoforms but with higher WT levels; unrelated healthy controls expressed only the WT isoform. Sequencing of gel-eluted bands confirmed the 19-bp deletion in the mutant isoform (data not shown). Thus, c.1272C>T variant creates a mutant mRNA isoform through aberrant splicing; in homozygous state, the mutant isoform predominates over WT in P1.\n\nTo determine the impact of the predominant aberrant ZAP70 mRNA isoform on protein production, we performed immunoblot analysis on P1's PBMCs and confirmed reduced ZAP-70 levels, as was seen in the original childhood investigations (Fig E1, C) .\n\nPlasmids encoding the open-reading frame of WT ZAP-70 (ZAP-70 wt ) or the 19-bp deleted variant (ZAP-70 mut ) were stably transfected into ZAP-70-deficient Jurkat P116 cells, and immunoblot of cell lysates confirmed the absence of ZAP-70 protein with the mutant isoform (Fig 1, E) . TcR signaling downstream of ZAP-70, assessed by phosphorylation of linker for activation of T cells, was absent following OKT3 stimulation of ZAP-70 mut -transfected Jurkat P116, but intact with ZAP-70 wt (see Fig E3, B, in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). These findings confirm that the mutant ZAP70 mRNA resulting from the c.1272C>T variant is null.\n\nAlthough the mutant donor splice site (DSS mut ) is stronger than the native WT site (DSS wt ), the latter is still intact and functionally able to generate WT ZAP70 mRNA and protein. In P1's homozygous mutant state, this is clearly inadequate for T-cell homeostasis. However, in heterozygous family members, ZAP-70 WT protein is sufficiently produced to maintain an otherwise well state. We hypothesized that blocking the stronger DSS mut in P1 would favor usage of DSS wt to increase WT ZAP-70 levels and consequently, T-cell function. To prove this, we designed an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (AMO) to target the c.1272C>T variant while sparing the native exon-intron junction so as to block the mutant splice effect during processing of ZAP70 pre-mRNA (Fig 1, F) . To confirm that the AMO specifically inhibited expression of the mutant ZAP70 isoform (ie, blocked its transition from pre-mRNA to mRNA), we treated P1's PBMCs and demonstrated correction of splicing (Fig 1, G) . Optimization studies demonstrated maximal corrective effect starting at 48 hours using 5 mM AMO, producing approximately 50% WT mRNA (confirmed by sequencing; data not shown). A similar AMO-induced effect on mutant mRNA was seen on the sister's cells (data not shown); there were insufficient number of cells from P1's parents for testing. To verify the specificity of this effect, we treated cells from healthy controls and observed no effect (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis of P1's AMO-treated PBMCs demonstrated increased ZAP-70 expression, confirming that the correction of aberrant splicing results in augmented production of ZAP-70 protein (Fig 2, A and B) . AMO-treated PBMCs demonstrated increased linker for activation of T cells activation following OKT3 stimulation compared with untreated cells (Fig 2, A and B) , indicating that this restored ZAP-70 retains functionally intact TcR signaling. To determine whether the AMO could improve cellular function, we evaluated the expression of prototypical T-cell cytokine genes, IL2, IL4, IL10, and IFNG (IFN-g) (Fig 2, C) . AMO treatment alone increased IL2, IL4, and IL10 expression; IL2 and IL4 expression was further enhanced by CD3/CD28 stimulation (Fig 2, C) . Treatment with AMO had no effect on IFN-g expression (data not shown), likely due to the reestablished T H 2-driven responses in the PBMCs polarizing away from T H 1 responses. Last, AMO treatment reestablished the proliferative response to CD3/CD28 costimulation in P1's primary T cells, an effect seen in both CD4 1 and CD8 1 T cells (Fig 2, D expression of WT ZAP-70 protein, which is molecularly intact and capable of restoring key T-cell functional responses.\n\nAnalysis of this hypomorphic ZAP-70-deficient patient uniquely illustrates several key points: (1) Clinically, the morbid natural history suggests a role for ZAP-70 in the functional control of double-stranded DNA viruses beyond the generation of CD8 1 T cells, which requires further elucidation. Interestingly, the autoimmune diseases here (colitis; nephropathy) were also reported by Chan et al, 1 who elegantly demonstrated that a fine molecular balance in ZAP-70 effect on T-cell signaling can be associated with autoimmunity only. (2) Genetically, it shows that synonymous genetic variants may be deleterious by modifying splicing, with hypomorphism resulting from a skewed net balance of amorphic versus residual WT protein.\n\n(3) Immunotherapeutically, it demonstrates that the accurate identification of causal genetic lesions permits a mutationsilencing approach that leads to molecular correction and recuperation of fundamental T-cell cytokine responses, at least in vitro. Although the breadth of T-cell functions could not be fully investigated pragmatically, to our knowledge this represents the first example in which AMO therapy successfully restored immune function in primary cells from a human with a genetically defined immunodeficiency. This approach could also extend to therapeutically modulate functional singlenucleotide polymorphisms in immune genes. Clearly, additional parameters will need to be addressed before this approach can be used in clinical practice (eg, pharmacokinetics and safety), although this strategy is in use for inborn errors of muscle or metabolism. 9 Overall, the insight gained from this work opens new avenues for individualized, mutation-targeting therapy for CID. \n\nTo the Editor: Periostin, an extracellular protein, has emerged as a novel mediator of allergic diseases and plays an important role in tissue remodeling. Serum periostin, as a biomarker, is elevated in severe eosinophilic asthma and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease 1 and levels can predict the development of airflow limitation in patients with asthma on an inhaled corticosteroid 2 as well as responsiveness to omalizumab or lebrikizumab in uncontrolled severe allergic asthma. 3, 4 However, despite its clinical significance, the mechanism by which periostin regulates inflammation remains poorly understood in the pathogenesis of airway inflammatory diseases.\n\nChronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is one of the most common chronic rhinologic diseases and can significantly reduce the quality of life of affected subjects. Increased periostin production in sinonasal tissues occurs in subjects with CRS, particularly J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL MAY 2017\n\nSubjects and the patient's family members provided informed consent on McGill University Health Centre institutional review board-approved research protocol (GEN10-256).
