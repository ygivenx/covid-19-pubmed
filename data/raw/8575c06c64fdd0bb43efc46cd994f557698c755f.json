{"title": "Clinical significance of IgM and IgG test for diagnosis of highly suspected COVID-19 infection", "body": "COVID-19 which was discovered in Wuhan due to pneumonia virus cases in 2019 [1] , and was named by the World Health Organization on January 12, 2020. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause colds and more serious diseases [2] . COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus strain that has never been found in humans before. Common signs of a person infected with COVID-19 include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and dyspnea.\n\nIn more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and even death. There is currently no specific treatment for diseases caused by COVID-19 [3] .\n\nHowever, many symptoms can be managed, so they need to be shown that cases can be traced to close contact with confirmed cases [4, 5] .\n\nAccording to the sixth edition of the diagnostic criteria, the COVID-19 cases are divided into two categories: \"suspected cases\" and \"confirmed cases\".

COVID-19 is sudden and public events in the worldwide [6] . Timely and accurate diagnosis of it is very important for the detection and therapy of patients. However, in the clinical practice, the detection standard varied partly with rapidly growing awareness of COVID-19. Nucleic acid detection, chest CT, epidemiological history and clinical manifestations were recognized as diagnostic basis [7, 8] . However, the nucleic acid detection had the limitation of operators, time consuming, easy pollution. CT results often can be changed at severely infected patients, and the specificity was also limited. IgM/IgG antibody detection method has the advantages of simple, easy, and high sensitivity.\n\nIn our study, by evaluating the clinical significance of IgM and IgG for the highly suspected COVID-19 infection patients, we aimed to provide a quick, simple, accurate diagnostic method for the detection of suspected patients.\n\nThis is a retrospective study which was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University (NYSZYYEC20200009).

As shown in Figure 1B , the IgG Flu of 15 patients was more than 1.02, the positive rate was 45.45%. As shown in Figure 2A , among the 24 patients with COVID-19 nucleic acid positive results, the IgM Flu of 19 patients was more than 0.88, the positive rate was 79.17%.

It showed significantly difference between the two groups (P=0.0298). C-reactive protein is an acute phase protein synthesized by liver cells when the body is exposed to inflammatory stimuli such as microbial invasion or tissue damage. The detection of CRP is widely used in clinical applications, including the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of acute infectious diseases, the monitoring of postoperative infections, the observation of the efficacy of antibiotics, the detection of disease course and prognosis. In clinical practice, some patients with COVID-19 would suddenly worsen in the later stage and soon enter a state of multiple organ failure. It may be related to the sudden initiation of an inflammatory storm in critically ill patients. The inflammatory storm not only causes lung injury, but also causes multiple organs such as the liver, heart muscle, and kidney damage. Therefore, \"inflammatory storm\" is All rights reserved.

First, the relatively small sample size, difference of IgM and IgG antigen binding site, difference of COVID-19 nucleic acid design, it may result in the bias of results. Second, because of the different time that from a patient who were firstly exposed to the virus to the detection, the detection positive rate of IgM and IgG may be affected.

Third, the detection value of IgM and IgG should be followed up in the future study.\n\nIn summary, compared with the nucleic acid detection, the IgM and IgG may provide a quick, simple and accurate aided detection method for suspected COVID-19 patients. We should combine the nucleic acid, IgM, IgG, CT scan and clinical characteristics results together for the diagnosis of COVID-19. "}
