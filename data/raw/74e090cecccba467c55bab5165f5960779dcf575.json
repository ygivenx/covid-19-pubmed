C.\n\nMuch of the notoriety attached to the feline leukemia virus (FeLV) stems from its ability to induce lymphoma and leukemia in naturally outbred cats which share the same environment with man. Leukemia and lyrnphoma, however, represent uncommon manifestations of FeLV infection. In its more frequent interactions with cat hemopoietJc and lymphoid tissues, FeLV behaves as a tripartite agent. It acts as an in[ectious agent, a genetic agent, and rarely, as a disease-causing agent. Moreover, the feline host exhibits a tridimensional micro-environmental response to FeLV. Lymphoreticular and marrow (:ells serve as the primary targets for viral replication, as the primary effectors of viral restriction and as the primary targets for FeLV-Jnduced cytoproliferative and cytosuppressive disease. Lastly, there are trinal rnacroenvironmental influences on the immunobiology of FeLV infection and FeLV-related diseases. These include evolution, feline social habits, and intercurrent pathogens.\n\nA. FeLV as an Infectious Agent\n\nFeLV is an enveloped, oncogenic RNA virus containing reverse transcriptase (RT) and\n\nis classified as an oncovirus in the family Retroviridae (Fenner, i97~) . Certain viral proteins have defined contributions to the biology of FeLV. The internal core of FeLV consists of tightly coiled viral RNA packaged and protected from nucleases by hexagonally arranged core proteins of 27,000, 13,000, and 10,000 daltons, and designated p27, pI3(C) and pl0, respectively (Graves and Velicer, 197#; Schafer and Bolognesi, I977) .\n\nThis core complex also encompasses the virion reverse transcriptase (RT) (Scolnik et al., 1970 ) required for synthesis of DNA complementary to the RNA of the infectious FeLV.\n\nThe core complex is surrounded by acidic proteins of 12,000 daltons (p12) which constitute the inner coat. Centrifugad to the inner coat is the viral envelope whose major component is a glycosylated protein of 70,000 daltons (gp70) arranged as spheres displayed on radiating spikes derived from the minor envelope protein which masses i),000 daltons (pIS(E)) .\n\nFollowing adsorption and penetration, FeLV is uncoated and the RNA is copied into a single strand of complementary DNA (cDNA) using the virion RT primed by a small tRNA molecule (reviewed in Varrnus, 1982; Litvak and Araya, 1982) . The de novo synthesized DNA serves as a template for the formation of the double-stranded DNA provirus which circularizes and integrates to become part of the (:at genome. Synthesis and integration of the provirus occur only in those ceils that undergo DNA synthesis (Temin, 197l) . Viral RNA (vRNA) is transcribed from the integrated provirus by DNAdependent RNA polymerases and translated on host ribosomes to generate precursor structural and envelope polyproteins. These polyproteins migrate to the plasma membrane to thicken the lipid bilayer and initiate the evagination known as the viral bud (Schafer and Bolognesi, 1977; Bolognesi et al., 197g) . Peripherally, the envelope precursors undergo post-translational cleavage and the minor fragment (pl \u00a7(E)) spans the plasma membrane as transmembranous spikes firmly embedded in the lipid bilayer (Bolognesi et al., 197g) . Protruding knobs representing the major fragment are glycosylated (gp70) and are welded to the spikes of plS(E) by disulfide linkages (Bolognesi et al., 197g) . Centrally, the structural precursors are processed and the individual proteins re-associate according to their biochemical and biophysical properties to encapsidate the ribonucleoprotein core (Graves and Velicer, 1974; $chafer and Bolognesi, 1977; Okasinki and Velicer, 1977; Pinter and Fleissner, 1979) .\n\nFeline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA)\n\nThe expression of all the viral structural and envelope proteins in the cytoplasm of ~ells with productive or partially productive FeLV infections is correlated highly with the expression of gp70 and p27 at the cellular membrane (Yoshiki et al., 1974) . Expression of FeLV proteins and FeLV-induced tumor antigens, however, are discordant. FeLVinduced hemolymphatic malignancies are distinguished by a common tumor-specific antigen, the feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) which is present on transformed cells from cats with highly expressed (productive) FeLV infections and from cats with minimally expressed (nonproductive) FeLV infections (Essex et al., 1971a, b; Hardy et al., 1977, 19g0) . FOCMA likely is present on preneoplastic lyrnphocytes in the bone marrow and mesenteric lymph node (t~ice and Olsen, 19gl) and recent investigations using monoclonal antibodies suggest that the expression of FOCMA and the partial expression of FeLV C envelope genes (env genes -see Sections ll.B.2., [II.C.3.) are interdependent events (Vedbrat et al., 1983) . While the exact origins and functions of FOCMA remain speculative, it is clear that antibody to FOCMA determinants effects anti-tumor immunosurveillance in the cat lymphoma/FeLV model (Essex et al., 197 \u00a7 and see Section I]l.B.t~).\n\nThe major core protein p27, known as the major group specific antigen (GSA), confers interspecies antigenic cross reactivity to FeLV (Hardy et al., [973) . Its presence in the cytoplasm of circulating neutrophils and platelets by fixed cell immunofluorescence assay (Hardy et al., 1973) has a 98% correlation with recovery of infectious virus (Fischinger et al., 197t~) from plasma (Hoover et al., 1977; and defines the FeLV viremic (persistent productive -see Sections II.A.6, IlI.A.l.b) state.\n\nSoluble p27 in serum, generally measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EL1SA Saxinger et al., 1980; , may manifest either viremia (68% of EL]SA-positive cats) or occult FeLV infection (32% of ELlSA-positive cats - Lutz et al., 1980; Saxinger et al., 1980; and see Section III.B.9).\n\nThree antigenica]ly distinct forms of the major envelope glycoprotein (gp70) specify three subgroups (serotypes) of FeLV, designated FeLVA, FeLVB, and FeLV C. These envelope gene products determine infectivity, interference, host range properties, and pathogenicity, and as subgroup-specific antigens evoke the virus neutralizing antibody responses important in the reversal of viremia in cats that regress FeLV infection (Sarma and Log, 1973; Schaller and Olsen, 1975; Hardy et al., 1976; Jarrett and Russell, 1978; Russell and 3arrett, 197g) . Virus adsorption, and hence infectivity, is dependent upon the affinity o\u00a3 gp70 for host cellular FeLV receptors and virus neutralizing antibody blocks initial adsorption. Dessication, heat (56\u00b0C, 3 rain) and ultraviolet light detach gp 70 and inactivate FeLV.\n\nThe minor envelope protein (pl5(E)) causes the profound depression of T lymphocyte function that accompanies viremia (Mathes et al., 1978, see Section lll.C.l.) . The binding of pIS(E) to the first component of complement (Bartholomew and Esser, 197g) activates the classical pathway. This causes complement consumption and results in ineffective virolysis in cats (Kobilinsky et al., 1979, see Section III.B.8.) .\n\nDomestic cats are exposed to FeLV following prolonged contact with the saliva or urine of naturally virernic cats (Francis et al., 1977; Hoover et al., 1977) . High titers of infectious FeLV are excreted by pharyngeal, salivary~ bladder and intestinal epithelia but virus survival at room temperature or under conditions of dessication is less than 2 hours (Francis et al., 1977) . Therefore, e*ficient virus transmission appears to require either direct contact between cats, transfer o5 saliva on hands or teeding utensils, or exposure to recently voided urine in communal litter pans.\n\nThe presumed portal of entry following contact in nature (Hardy et al., 1973; ]arrett et al., 1973) is the oronasal pharynx, and experimental oronasal challenge (Hoover et al., 1972) of cats with FeLV leads to viremia and disease or nonproductive infection and immunity (see below). Congenital transmission of FeLV has been proposed to account for the clinical observation that viremic queens may bear viremic kittens, but the question of intrauterine versus lactation-associated versus contact exposure of kittens has not been resolved (Cotter et al., 1975) . Recent experiments document the transplacental passage of FeLV and its isolation from the embryonic hemolymphatic tissues of fetal kittens obtained by hysterectomy from viremic gravid queens (Hoover et al., 1983) .\n\nSix sequential stages in the pathogenesis of FeLV replication have been identified using immunofluorescence assay for p27 in paraffin-embedded tissue sections (Table 1 , see Rojko et al., 1979a) . FeLV/host cell contact is initiated in the lymphoepithelia and follicular lymphocytes in the pharyngeal and palatine tonsils (Stage 1) in the first 2 days after exposure (DAE) via oronasal instillation.\n\nThe virus next is amplified in the draining lymph node and infectious FeLV is transported by lymphocytes and macrophages (Stage 2) to secondary sites (marrow, systemic and gut-associated lymphoid tissue -GALT) where massive viral amplification occurs (Stages 3, z~) . This mononuclear cell-associated viremia is reminiscent of that described for other oncogenic (Epstein-Barr Virus -Epstein and Achong, 1977) , and nononcogenic viruses (Feline Panleukopenia - Carlson et al., 1978) . It provides rapid, efficient distribution of FeLV to the mitotically active cells in the marrow and GALT. This is vital because cells initially infected by retroviruses must enter mitosis to permit integration of provirus and to support replication of progeny infectious virus (Temin, 1971) . Cell association also protects FeLV from reticuloendothelial clearance and from inactivation by humoral lipid or protein moieties as described for feline (Welsh et al., 1975; Sherwin et al., 1978; Bartholomew and Esser, 197g) , murine, and bovine retroviruses (Welsh et al., 1975; Sherwin et al., 197g; Bartholomew and Esser, 197g; de Noronha et al., 1978; Schwartz et al., 1979; Gupta and Ferrer, 1982) . Proliferation of FeLV in the spleen, lymph nodes, and GALT distant from the site of inoculation is evident in cats between 3 and 12 DAE (Stage 3). FeLV p27 is most concentrated in the rapidly dividing lymphoid cells of the germinal centers of cortical follicles. This early viral tropism for B-lymphocytes (see Section III.A.I.) mimics the proclivity of certain MuLV strains for germinal center immunoblasts early in infection (Hanna et al., 1970; Ruddle et al., 1976; Isaak et al., 1979) .\n\nThe fourth stage ( Uninfected clones of granulocytes and monocytes usually are identifiable. P27 is rare in eosinophil precursors. In erythroid series cells, intensity of FeLV replication is inversely related to cell maturation. Replication in early erythroid precursors is extinguished when hemoglobinization and nuclear pyknosis distinguish the basophilic normoblast (rubricyte).\n\nConcomitant with marrow infection is the onset of multiple foci of productive infection in the crypt (germinal) epithelium of the small and large intestines. Viral antigen is confined to the basilar mitotic cell population and is absent from the mature distal absorptive epithelium lining the villi. Retroviruses generally are not cytopathic and replication of FeLV in the rapidly dividing cells of the marrow, ]yrrlphoid tissue, and intestine is not associated with overt cytopathic change (necrosis, polykaryo(ytosis, et(.) .\n\nThe presence of FeLV in lyrnphoid and rnarrow tissues, however, may depress normal ceil turnover and initiate atrophy (see Sections [II.C.] ,2).\n\nThe appearance of p27-positive neutrophJls and platelets in the circulation is considered the fifth stage in the evolution of progressive FeLV infection ( ]t~-2g DAE ).\n\nThis phase directly reflects infection of marrow progenitors and is the onset el marroworigin viremia (Hardy et al., 1973) which is the harbinger of persistent virernia and the induction of fatal FeLV-related disease (Hardy et al., i973; Hoover eta]., 1977; Rojko et al., 1979a) .\n\nThe initial marrow reiease of FekV-infected neutrophils and platelets coincides exactly with development of protracted neutropenia and lyrnphopenia (21 to 56 DAE - Cockerell et al., 1976b; Rojko et at., i979a) and thrombocytopenia (Pedersen et al., 1977) . (Hard}, et al., 1976; Rojko et al., 1979a) . This latter group el cats is at particular risk for reactivatable FeLV infections (see Section III.B.9.) and p27\n\nantigenemia (Lutz et al., 1950; Saxinger et al., 1980; Rice and Olsen, 198i; Rojko et al., 1952a) .\n\nIn cats that fail to develop VN and FOCMA ar)tibody, FeLV infection extends to multiple mucosal and glandular epithelial tissues between 28 and z~2 DAE and thereafter.\n\nThe earliest and most consistently infected epithelial tissues are those of the oropharynx, nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, stomach, salivary gland, pancreas, and urinary bladder.\n\nReplication begins in multiple foci in the mitotic layers and progresses to diffuse involvement of the mucosa of the bladder, oral and nasal pharynx, and trachea and the release of infectious FeLV into the secretions of persistently viremic cats.\n\nIn dramatic contrast is the tissue distribution of FeLV p27 in cats that develop immune (regressive) infection between 28 and 42 DAE and thereafter. Immune cats develop FOCMA and VN antibody by l& to 56 DAE (Rojko et al., 1979a; Rice and Olsen, 19gi; Rojko et al., 1952) and are able to abort virus production prior to widespread marrow or epithelial infection. Recent evidence indicates that immune cats remain latently infected with FeLV (Post et al., 1980; Rojko et al., 1982a; Madewell and ZIarrett, 1982 Varmus, 1982; Weiss et al., 1983) is shown in Fig. 1 \n\nIn the synthesis of the corresponding DNA provirus (Fig. l) , the U3 and U3 regulatory domains are duplicated and found at both the 5' and 3' ends in the order U3, R, U3 (reviewed in Varmus, 1992~ Weiss et ai.~ 1993 . These redundancies are termed the long terminal repeats (LTR's) and are flanked at the 5' and 3' ends of the entire provirus by virus-specific inverted repeats of base pairs (IRs). These redundancies are critical to reverse transcription of the viral RNA, integration of the newly synthesized, circular FeLV provirus, and serve as nontranscribed regulators of expression of the integrated proviral DNA. Nucleotide sequence analysis of cloned retroviral LTR's (Hughes et ah, 197g) predicts that LTR's provide functions critical to eukaryotic gene expression such as promotion, initiation, and polyadenylation of transcripts. The U3 sequence related to the \"TATAA box\" probably determines the initiation site for transcription.\n\nThe question whether proviruses integrate at random or into specific sites in vivo is not resolved. In a mass-infected population, proviral integration is multifocal (Hughes et al., 197g~ Weiss et a]., 1993) . Recently, Mullins et al. (19gl) have cloned exogenous (ecotropic) FeLV proviruses obtained from FeLV-infected human fibroblasts free of background retroviruses endogenous to feline DNA (see below).\n\nTheir studies have revealed that replication-competent (infectious via transfection) and replication-defective (noninfectious) FeLV proviruses do not show preferred integration sites nor do they differ structurally. While provirus integration into virus-infected, nonneoplastic (:ells likely is random~ it often is at preferred sites in neoplastic cells (Neel eta]., 19gl~ Tschilis et al., 1983) . It is thought that either the proviral insertion causes the neoplastic event or that cells with common provlra] insertions are selected for during expansion of neoplastic clones. Preferred integration facilitates oncogenesis by promoter insertion in avian bursal lymphomagenesJs. Using a cloned probe specific to the U3 region of the LTR of exogenous FeLV, Casey et al. (lggl) have demonstrated that some FeLV-positive lymphomas have preferred integration sites and others do not. The significance of this to the leukemogenic process is commented on in Section lIt.C.3.\n\nInfection of cycling cells with FeLV leads to the formation and stable integration of up to t~0-.50 proviruses into the cellular DNA. Integrated proviruses have been likened to a nasty genetic dowry (Bishop~ 1982) . These can be inserted at many sites, carry inherent potent regulatory elements in their long terminal repeats (LTRs)~ but also are subject to host regulatory influences (reviewed in Varmus, 1982~ Weiss et al., 1983 \n\nThe cellular DNA of the domestic cat contains two unrelated nucleic acid sequences homologous to two distinct retroviruses and represented by multiple copies (Niman et al., 1977a,b; Okabe et al., 1978; Koshy et al., 1980; Casey et al., 19gl; Mullins et al., 19gl; Soe et al., i983) . Eight to 10 copies of endogenous FeLV sequences per haploid genome consist of discrete, nontandemly arranged genes that differ qualitatively and quantitatively from exogenous, ectropic proviruses. The U5 LTR sequence is variable in location and copy number (up to 15 copies per cell) between cats. Each cat, however~ has the same sequence organization in different tissues, indicating that the U5 pattern is inherited throughout the germ line. Cells infected with ecotropic FeLV have 10-fold increases in U5 sequences but, again, U5 patterns are characteristic to the cat, not endogenous versus exogenous sequences. In contrast, the U3 region of the LTR is shared between exogenous FeLV serotypes (see Section ll.C.l) and is absent from endogenous FeLV and can be used to identify exogenously acquired FeLV sequences in neoplastic or nonneoplastic cat cells (Casey et al., 1981) .\n\nInsight into the origin and organization of endogenous FeLV elements has been provided by Soe et al. (1983) who have cloned and characterized endogenous FeLV sequences from a cat genomic library constructed from placental DNA of a specificpathogen-free cat. Endogenous sequences reveal deletions in the ~-p~l and env regions that render them incapable of encoding infectious virus and explain the subgenomic expression of endogenous FeLV in placenta and the non-inducibility of endogenous FeLVs from cat cells (Benveniste et al., 1975) . It is likely that endogenous FeLVs have originated either by germ-line insertion of a complete ecotropic FeLV with subsequent deletion, or by insertion of a defective variant (Soe et al., 1983) .\n\nOther feline retroviruses, RD-118 and like viruses (McAllister et al., 1972; Benveniste et al., 1975) are unrelated to FeLV but are closely related to baboon endogenous retrovirus, and have not been implicated in natural disease. These have xenotropic host ranges, and can be induced from, but will not infect, feline cells in vitro.\n\nRD-llO readily infects heterologous fibroblasts and was isolated originally from catpassaged, human rhabdomyosarcoma cells (&1cAllister et al., 1972) . Although norrnall)\n\nrepressed in viv_ o, RD-IIL~ mRNA is expressed in placenta, in aging animals, zLnd in some FeLV-positive and FeLV-negative tumors (Nirnan et al., 1977a,b) Although not associated with a specific disease state, FeLV B is intensely cytopathic for feline marrow cells in vitro (Onions eta[., 19g0) . Recent reports of homologous sequences shared by FeLV B and a rnurine retrovirus cytopathic for mink cells (mink ceil focusforming-RICF-virus) have raised speculations as to the origin and leukemogenicity of FeLV B (Elder and ~Muilins, 1983) . MCF viruses are spontaneous env gene recombinants between ecotropic and xenotropic retroviruses with high leukernogenicity in vivo, cytopathiclty and extended host range in vitro. FeLV B is the most frequent helper FeLV implicated in natural transduction of the fes proto-oncogene from cat fibroblasts and the resultant generation of acutely transforming feline sarcoma viruses (FeSVs).\n\nThe extreme delay in the appearance of free, infectious FeLV C in plasma may result from its relative defectiveness for replication in vivo. Vedbrat et al. (1993) report that even ceils that produce only FeLV A or FeLV A and FeLV B as cell-free virus have many partially replicated, immature FeLV C buds embedded in the plasma membrane and suggest that the partial expression of ]FeLV C is equivalent to FOCk~A-L expression (see Section III.C.3). Based on its delay in appearance and defectiveness for replication of FeLVc and induczion by FeLVc-devoid viral stocks, many workers have considered FeLV C also ~ candidate recombinant virus.\n\nAnother putative recombinant virus isolated by in vitro cloning of FeLVA substrains has envelope characteristics similar to both FeLV and RD-i]8 (Haberman and Veticer, 1980) . Further characterization of tills strain, PR-S, which is partly cytopathic for feline fibroblasts in vitro and induces eoslnophilic leukemia or hypereosinophilia in vivo (Lewis et al., 19g3b) , should enhance the understanding of the relationship between env gene products and biologic activity of retroviruses.\n\nThe Kawakami-Theilen strain of FeLV(-FeLV-KT) is a mixture of FeLVABc, and causes profound erylhrosuppression and death within 9 weeks of inoculation of neonatal kittens but is virtually apathogenic in weanlings and adults (Hoover et al., 1974~ Mackey et al., 1975~ Onions et al., 1982 . Passage of FeLVAB C through guinea pig cells in vitro selects for biologically cloned FeLV C (Sarma strain) (Sarma and Log, 1973) . That this FeLV C reduces viremia and erythroJd aplasia in vivo and suppression of erythroid colony formation in vitro suggests a direct relationship between productive FeLV C infection and anemiagenesis (Onions et al., 19g2) .\n\nThe induction of FeLV-related disease usually follows the onset of marrow origin viremia. Even though the leukemogenic event probably is random, high levels of viremia ensure that the damaging virus will be present when cells of the appropriate histogenesis and maturation reach a critical stage in their cycle, in the mouse, (see Section llI.C.3), chronic antigenemia with MuLVgp71 incites chronic immunostimulation of uninfected Tcells and renders them susceptible to the leukemogenic event, in cats, circulating virion proteins are immunosuppressive (FeLVpIS(E), see Section lll.C.1), erythrosuppressive (FeLVcgpT0? , see Section III.C.2), and embryosuppressive (Hoover et al., 1993) In progressive FeLV infections, a persistent polyclonal infection of follicular lymphocytes and bone marrow precursors but not thymocytes in association with protracted lymphopenia and neutropenia (Rojko et al., 1979a; J9gl) and limited anti-FeLV humoral responses during preleukemia precede the emergence of neoplastic T-cells in the thymus and elsewhere (Rojko et al., 1979a~ Hoover et al., ] 978). The principal FeLVinfected cell in the lymph nodes of viremic cats is a nonadherent, CR-bearing Blymphocyte (Rojko et al., 19gl) . P27 is diffuse in large (20-t~5 urn) lymphoblasts with eccentric, large, round to cleaved nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Plasma ceils are densely The functional integrity of the B-lymphocytes that replicate FeLV is unknown. In the mouse, splenic B-lymphocytes that are concurrently infected with MuLV produce less antibody to sheep erythrocytes than do uninfected spleen cel]s~ but this is most probably due to increased T-suppressor activity (Cerny and Stiller, 1975) . Naturally viremic pet cats have adequate IgM but ineffective and delayed lgG responses to a synthetic Tdependent antigen and a systemic T-helper defect has been postulated (Trainin et al., 1993) . Experimentally-induced viremic cats also produce lgM but not IgG antibody in response to FeLV-associated antigens (Mathes et al., 19gl) . These facts may signify altered B-cell function, altered regulation by T-helper, T-suppressor or accessory cells, or a changed microenvironment (FeLV-infected lymph node versus control lymph node).\n\nto be simultaneous with the FeLV-associated peripheral blood ]ymphopenia in preleukemia (Rojko et al., ] 9gl). Redistribution of lymphoid subpopulations also has been reported for preleukemic MuLV infections (Gillette and Fox, 19g0) , and increased numbers of CR-and Fc R-positive cells have been described in preneoplastic routine mammary tumor virus infections (Epstein et ah, 197g) . The probable mechanisms important in preleukemic immunomodulation are described further in Section III.C.I.\n\nA critical feature that distinguishes persistent productive FeLV infection from persistent nonproductive infection is viral replication by differentiating granulocytes and macrophages in the marrow and elsewhere. Furthermore, marrow origin viremia is accepted universally as the harbinger of fatal FeLV-associated disease (Hardy et al., 1973~ Hoover, eta]., 1977 . In contrast, in cats that regress productive marrow infection and develop latent FeLV infection (see Sections HI.B.I.d, III.B.9), refractoriness of myelomonocytic series cells to FeLV replication is correlated directly with increasing maturation. Even in viremic cats which experience extensive FeLV replication in myeloid progenitor cells, differentiated granulocytes, and marrow adherent macrophages, most mature peritoneal macrophages are spared (Hoover, et al., 19gl) . It is speculated that these are derived from uninfected myeloid clones, or become refractory to, or abort FeLV infection during, the process of differentiation in vivo (Hoover et al., 19gl~ Rojko et ah, 1982a) . This relationship between macrophage susceptibility to productive viral infection and disease progression also holds for mice infected with the leukernogenic Friend MuLV complex (Marcelleti and Furmanski, 1979) , and was described originally for mice and monkeys infected with such non-oncogenic viruses as herpes, corona, pox and flavi viruses (Mogensen, 1979; Daughaday et al., 1981; Peiris et al., 1981; Schlesinger and Brandriss, 1981) . Susceptibility versus resistance of macrophages to viral replication is central to the mechanism o1 age-related susceptibility versus resistance to viral persistence. This topic is amplified in Sections III.B.2,3.\n\nFeLV replication in follicular (B) lymphocytes and myelornonocytic series cells is a constant feature of persistent productive FeLV infection.\n\nIn contrast, replication in putative T-cell regions is limited to the recirculating lymphocyte pool and to the thymi< medulla early in infection (Rojko et al., 1979a) . The disappearance of replicating FeLV from T-cell areas during preleukemia is associated with lymphopenia (Rojko et al., 1979a; Cockerell et al., 1976a,b,c) loss 05 circulating T-suppressor cell (Still and Olsen, 1982) and T-cell mitogenic function, thymicolyrnphoid atrophy (Perryman e* al., 1972; Hoover et al., 1973) , and redistribution of latently infected T-cells to the mesenteric lymph nodes (Rojko et al., 198\u2022) , and precedes the emergence ol productively infected T-lympborna cells in the subcapsular cortical thymus and elsewhere (Cockerell et al., 1976a; Rojko et al., 1979) . Neoplastic: lymphocytes trom experimentaily and naturally infected cats usually bear T-cell markers (E rosette forming capacity, surface thyrnocyte antigen - Cockerell et al., 1976a) but rarely do appear as SIgC-bearing B-cells or null cells . The relative maturity of the transformed T-lymphon/a cells is dernonstrated by its lack of terminal transferase. Similar dissociation between lymphocyte tropisms for viral replication and virus-associated transformation have been observed in Moloney and AKR rnurine lymphornas (Lee and lhle, 1979; Isaak and Cerny, 1983 ) and its implications are summarized in Section \u2022II.C.3. \n\nIn Vitro a.\n\nThe age-related susceptibility ; see Section II1.B.2) of kittens versus adults to progressive FeLV infection in vivo is paralleled by 30-fold and 3-5-fold increments in the susceptibility of lymphocytes (Rojko et al., 1981) (Rojko et al., 1981) .\n\nAlternatively, differential susceptibility between freshly isolated and aged PBML could reflect alterations in the lymphocyte populations present at 0 hours versus 08 hours of incubation. Many PBML, especially unstimulated B and T lymphocytes, are short-lived in vitro. Only ~0-70% of the feline PBML originally isolated are viable after 48 hours and feline T cells lose their FcR within 24 hours in vitro (Rojko et al., 19S2b; Stiff and Olsen, 1982) . Furthermore, the removal of FoR-positive PBML at the time of culture initiation leads to a 1325-fold enhancement of productive infection when preincubated PBML are infected with FeLV-R (Rojko et al., 19g1) . This suggests that naturally occurring FcR cells limit the outgrowth of FeLV-infected cells or maintain FeLV-infected cells in a virus-nonproductive state. Similar suppression of EBV-infected cells by EBVnaive T cells with FcR is known to be mediated by interferon 19g0 (Rojko et al., 1992b) .\n\nThe heterogeneity in target cell susceptibility to infectious FeLV-R has been investigated using quiescent and mitogen-activated cells from blood, spleen~ lymph node, thymus and marrow cultured with lymphocyte growth factors (Rojko et al., 1981) .\n\nLymphocytes of all histogenetic origins are permissive to FeLV replication. Activation of lymphoid subsets by differential mitogenesis may lead to enhanced lymphocyte survival in vitro, the generation of more target cells, DNA synthesis, and favorable conditions for proviral integration and replication. Alternatively, residual mitogen may inactivate virus, or mitogen-activated lymphoblasts may have direct antivira] activity as has been described for PHA-stimulated human lymphoblasts exposed to coxsackie or influenzaviruses. Lastly, activated lymphoblasts may suppress the outgrowth of FeLV-infected cells as has been reported for human lymphocyte cultures exposed to EBV (Thor]ey-Lawson, 19g0). In the cas~ of the FeLV/feline lymphocyte model, it appears that FeLVinfected or sham-infected lyrnphoblasts may be initiated spontaneously or by exposure to mitogen. Continued growth is dependent upon the inclusion of lymphocyte conditioned medium as a source of growth and viability factors only (Rojko et aI., 19gl) .\n\nPermissiveness to productive infection, however, may be enhanced by the feline FoR and of the viral replication rate . This [inding suggests that increased FeLV production is related not simply to more cells entering mitosis, but probably also is related to more progeny virus being produced per (:ell or more total cells replicating virus. In murine mammary tumor virus-infected cells, the triggering of messenger RNA synthesis is associated with the triggering of proviral transcription and the increased production of progeny virus (Lee et al., 19gl) . It is thought that a complex of hormone and host-coded receptor interacts specifically with the MMTV LTR. Similarly, corticosteroids minimally alter the replication of ecotropic MuLV in permissive mouse cells but markedly increase its replication in nonproductively infected mouse embryo cells (Dunn et al., [975) . Either of two host/virus relationships usually ensues in cats exposed to FeLV: persistent viremia culminating in FeLV-related disease (Hard) ' et al., 19761 Hoover et al., 19761 Rojko et al., 1979a) or self-limiting infection in which productive hemolymphatic infection is transient and elicits protective titers of VN and FOCMA antibodies. In a few cats infected with FeLV, viremia is present in association with moderate titers of FOCMA and/or VN antibodies.\n\nThe host/virus interactions that determine the outcome of FeLV infection occur in the lymphoreticular tissues, the blood, and in the marrow in the first 4-6 weeks after experimental exposure (Hoover et ah, 1976 , 1977ai Rojko et al., 1979a . This interplay is critically dependent upon the functional integrity of these tissues and the age-related, irnmunocompetence of the cat (Hoover et al., 19761 Schaller et al., 197gi Hoover et al., 19gl; IRojko et a]., 1979a ,b,19gll Tart et al., 1979 . As described fully in Section II.A.6, natural (oronasa]) contact with FeLV initiates sequential FeLV replication in local and systemic lymphoid tissues, blood and marrow. Complement-associated, non-immune factors in normal cat serum probably limit viremia (Bartholomew and Esser, 197gi Kobilinsky et al., 1979) and are known to be age-dependent in other systems. Age-related increases in immunocompetence usually reflect age-related increases in macrophage antiviral, antitumor, or antigen processing functions (Unanue, 19g0 (Essex et al., 1971a (Essex et al., ,b,1975b Grant and Michalek, 19g] ; Grant et al., 1977~19g0a,b,19gl) and not by T-effector ceils. Antibodies against envelope virion components provide protection from marrow origin viremia (VN antibody -antigp70) (Schaller and Olsen, 1975; Hardy et al., 1976; Russell and 3arrett, 1978; Lutz et al., 1980) and antibodies against virion P,T are speculated to limit FeLV replication. Recent reports propose the simultaneous involvement of T-effector cells in the containment of FeLV-infected marrow cells (Rojko et al., 1982a) and FeSV-transformed, autochthonous, fibroblasts (McCarty and Grant, 1983 anemiagenic FeLV-KT, the acutely transforming FeSVs, and several FeLV strains isolated from naturally infected pet cats. Although the susceptibility of cats exposed to FeLV in nature may vary greatly, the rate of viremia conversion in adult urban eats naturally exposed to FeLV-shedding cats in multiple cat households ranges from 19-28%. 5ocioenvironmental factors that influence susceptibility are considered in Section [V.B.\n\nAlthough the phagocytic capacities of isolated macrophages from kittens and adults are equivalent, the mean FeLV susceptibility of macrophages from kittens is five times that of macrophages from adult cats. This maturation-dependent, refractoriness to FeLV replication is overcome readily by specific enhancement by treatment with hydrocortisone in vitro (Hoover et a]., 19gl) or prednisolone in vivo (Rojko et al., 1979b) . It also is abrogated when macrophages are poisoned by microcrystalline silica or depleted in the marrow and lymphoid necrosis induced by the resorptive carcinogen, methynitrosourea (Schaller et al., 197g; Tart et al., 1979) .\n\nTreatment with various doses of a synthetic adrenal corticosteroid, methyl prenisolone acetate, has resulted in a 7-fold augmentation of susceptibility of adult cats to persistent FeLV-R or persistent FeLV-KT viremia. These cats eventually die of FeLVrelated immunosuppression, lymphoma, or anemia. Similar pretreatment of adult mice with cortisone acetate has enhanced susceptibility to oncogenesis by Moloney murine sarcoma virus (Schachat et al., 1968) . The distribution of FeLV p27 in the tissues of cats exposed to concurrent FeLV and prednisolone is compatible with the hypothesis that corticosteroids enhance FeLV replication in, and impair FeLV containment by, macrophages in lymphoid and marrow tissues (Rojko et al., 1979) .\n\nIn cats treated with the lower doses of prednisolone (5 mg/kg), hematologic changes specific to FeLV/cortJcosteroid interactions are not masked by the overwhelming neutrophilic leukocytosis that accompanies higher dose regimens in FeLV-naive or FeLV- That corticosteroids are important in regulation of FeLV replication by bone marrow myelomonocytic precursors also may be inferred from their unique capacity to reactivate latent FeLV infections (see Section III.B.9).\n\nAdministration o\u00a3 silica before virus inoculation also markedly enhances the FeLV susceptibility of adult cats. Silica is toxic for isolated macrophages but not lymphocytes in vitro, and silica produces monocytopenia and neutrophilia, delayed skin allograft rejection, and augmented FOCMA antibody responses in vivo . These augmented FOCMA antibody responses are similar to those seen in the FeLV-low dose corticosteroid cats described above and probably reflect intermittent antigenemia. in regressor cats exposed to FeLV or FeSV b}\" experimental inoculation, lgG antibodies to FOCMA recognized by indirect membrane irr~munofluorescence (I~A1) assay against virus producer, feline lymphoma (FL7/#) cells first appear at 2-3 WAE. and persist at l-2 [og2s below peak titer for years (Essex et al., 1975b) . Persistence probably is due to intermittent stimulation by FOC~',IA expressed on latent[y infe(:ted, neoplastic or preneoplastic cells (see Section III.B.9).\n\nActual clearance of producer and nonproducer neoplastic cells probably is mediated by cytotoxic, complement-dependent antibody (CDA) to FOCMA (/%]athes eta[., ]976; Grant et al., ]977, 19g0a, b, 19gl) . Antibodies directed against FL7/4 ceils that bind rabbit complement appear early (2-3 WAE), peak earl}' (5 WAE) and abate rapidly ( g-9 WAE). Rabbit complement-fixing antibodies cause rapid lysJs (/4 hours) ol: FL7/4 cells;\n\ndo not correlate with [MI-FOC~IA antibodies, and are absorbed by disrupted FeLV.\n\nHence, these are more likely acute phase CDA to FeLV and not to FOCMA. In contrast are the antibodies to nonvirion determinants oJ: FL7t~ (:ells that bind cat complement and\n\ninitiate slow ]ysis (20 hr) of FL7/4 cells (Grant et al., [977) . These arise later and persist throughout the cat's lifespan to prevent emergence of producer or nonproducer lymphoma cells in vivo (Grant eta] ., ]9g0a,b,19gi). Moreover, regressor cat serum with FOC~IA activity will prevent the spontaneous reactivation of FeLV from autologous, latently infected, bone marrow cells in vitro and, presumably, /unctions similarly in vivo.\n\nWhether this antireactivation activity is directed against FOCMA or against normal marrow leukocyte alloantigens that intimate with FOCMA on the surface of neoplastic or preneoplastic ceils (Azoar and Essex, i979; Grant and ~Aichalek, 19gl; Dubey et al., 19gl; Lee et al., 1992) deserves further study. Regarding the last~ Grant and h.lichalek (19gl) have examined a panel of FOCMA-CDA containing alloantisera against a panel of virus producer, feline lymphoma cells. The sera identify not a single FOCMA, but rather unique and cross-reacting epitopes and react occasionally with normal splenic lymphocytes. The possibility that FOCMA is a leukocyte alloantigen or the incomplete expression of FeLV C env gene products at the plasma membrane is discussed further in Section IH.C.3. Mathes and Qlsen (19gl) As more cats die of aplastic FeLV-related diseases than die of proliferative FeLVrelated diseases (Cotter et al., 1975) and as the relative risk for lymphoma increases with duration of viremia, it is obvious that most cats must limit marrow origin viremia to remain disease free. Protection from marrow origin viremia is mediated by virus neutralizing (VN) antibody directed against subgroup specific envelope gp70s (Schaller and Olsen, 1977; Hardy et al., 1976; Hoover et al., 1977; de Noronha eta] ., 1978; Russell and 3arrett, 197g~ Lutz et al, 19g0) . Binding of VN antibody to gp70 prevents adsorption of FeLV to cellular FeLV gp70 receptors. Antibody to gp70 with biologic activity (neutralization or reverse interference) does not achieve high titers in vivo until 6-g WAE. The delay in its appearance likely is due to dilution by serum and consumption by FeLV-infected cells. Antibody to gp70 with high VN activity in vitro is protective in allogeneic cats to which it is passively transferred either via the colostrum (Hoover et al., 1977) or via systemic inoculation (de Noronha et al, 197g; Cotter et al., 19g0) .\n\nPrevention of viremia in susceptible animals is an early event. Passive transfer of serum from cats or goats hyperimmune to FeLV gp70 or the cross-reacting MuLV gp71 must occur within the first 6 DAE of susceptible kittens to FeLV to protect against induction of marrow origin viremia (de Noronha et al., 1978) . Occasional reports suggest that passive transfer of antibody to gpT0 will lead to partial remission or enhanced response to chemotherapy in lynlphomatous cats .\n\nThe development of ELISA and sensitive radiolabeJled irnn/unoprecipitation and fluorographic techniques has made possible the observation that viremia and antibody to gp70 can coexist (Lutz et al., 19g0; Mathes rind Olsen, 19S1) . It is not uncomnlon [or these cats also to have persistent lgG FOCM& antibody titers and/or evidence ol antibody to p27, pI5(C) and pIS(E). While cats with this pattern usuaIiy are considered to be healthy FeLV carriers and probably maintain antibody titers for years before succumbing to FeLV-related disease, the presence of an antibody excess, antigenemi<:\n\nsituation may precipitate immune-ruediated disorders including chronic glomerulonephritis and hypocornplementemia (Kobilinsky et al., 1979; 3ones et al.. 19g0; Snyder et al., 1982) .\n\nThe distribution of feline lymphocyte markers has been correlated with histogenetic origin (Taylor et aJ., 1975; Cockerell et al., 1976,a,b,c; Rojko et al., 1982b; Rojko et al., 19g3b (3) 2 (0) 5 (2) iBy rosette assay, using AET-treated GPE. 2By membrane fluorescence (antifeline thymocyte serum). 3By mernbrane fluorescence (antife]ine lgG and IgM). 4By rosette assay, using sheep erythrocytes coated with ]9S antisheep erythrocytes and rnouse complement. 5By demonstration of cytoplasmic fluorescence in methanol acetic acid-fixed, cytocentrifuge]ymphocyte preparations, using antifeline lgG. 6By rosette assay, using sheep erythrocytes coated with 7S antisheep erythrocytes. Grant, 1983) . Also relevant is the abrogation of T-cell responses known to be caused by FeLVpI5(E) and discussed in Section [H.C.1.\n\nThree pieces of evidence implicate natural killer cells and/or interferon in the regulation of FeLV-infected cells (Rojko et al., 1981; Dubey et al., 1982; Tompkins and Cummins, 1982) . The first is the demonstration of a short-lived mononuclear cell in the blood but not thymus or marrow of FeLV-naive cats that limits the outgrowth of FeLVinfected cells following in vitro exposure to FeLV (see Section IlI.A.2). Similar Tsuppressor and nonT-suppressor effects described for EBV are known to be mediated by interferon (Thorley-Lawson, 1980) .\n\nThe second is a clinical report that the administration of interferon to anemi% viremic cats, has led to partial remission of viremia and recovery from anemia (Tompkins and Cummins, 1982) .\n\nTile third is concerned with the control of human lymphoblastoid cell lines infected with FeLV in vitro (Azocar and Essex, 1979; Dubey et al., 1982; Lee et al., 1982) .\n\nNeoplastic T-lymphoblasts are more susceptible to productive FeLV infection than are nonimmunoglobulin proteins such as the plasma protein present in bovine leukemia virus (BoLV)-exposed but not BoLV-naive cattle (Gupta and Ferrer, 1982) . Complement components of humans, other primates, and cats but not guinea pigs lyse retroviruses directly (Bartholomew and Esser, 197g; Sherwin et al, 197g Snyder et ah, 1982) and (3) Schafer, 197g; Schwarz et ah, 1979) .\n\nStudies of the pathogenesis of regressive FeLV infection have demonstrated that in most cats exposed to the contagious feline leukemia virus (FeLV), viral replication is contained in target hemopoietic tissues and elicits humoral immunity to FeLV and to the feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) (Rojko et al., i979a) . The hypothesis that these ostensibly self-limiting infections might rather be persistent poorly expressed (latent) infections in certain hemopoietic cells could account for the protracted incubation periods, relapsing viremias (Post et al., 19g0) , persistently high titers of antiviraI and anti-FOCMA antibodies (Essex et al., 1975b) , appearance of FeLV p27 antigen in serum of otherwise nonviremic animals (Saxinger et al., 1980; Lutz et al., 19g0) and occurrence of FeLV-negative but FOCMA-positive leukemias in natura/iy infected pet cats (Hardy eta]., 1977) . Recent reports have detailed the reactivation of latent FeLV from myelomonocytic and lymphoid cells of cats immune to FeLV (Table 4 ) (Post et al., 19g0; Rojko et al., 1982a; Madewell and 3arrett, 1993) , some cats bearing FeLV-negative tumors (tRojko et al., 19S2a) , and kittens congenitally exposed to FeLV (Roiko et al., 1982a; Hoover et al., 1983) . Furthermore, the suppression of reappearance of FeLV infection by the host's immune system has been abrogogated by adrenal corticosteroid (Rojko et al., 19gl) .\n\nTherefore, latent FeLV infections are characterized by the absence of infectious virus in freshly isolated marrow, node, Me), and PBML and the reactivation of Vl from cultured marrow cells and a minor subset of nodal lymphocytes. These data suggest that self-limiting (regressive) FeLV infections are actually latent (nonproductive) infections of myelomonocytic precursor cells in the bone marrow and SPA-reactive cells in the lymph nodes (Rojko et al., 19g2a) .\n\nIn the contact exposure study, virus has been reactivated from 9 of 16 nonviremic, antibody-positive cats considered to harbor latent FeLV. Madewell and 3arrett (1993) have found that cats infected soon after exposure to FeLV are more likely to develop latent infection than those that resist contact exposure to FeLV (by antisocial behavior?) and recover. They report no difference in serum antibody titers from cats with reactivatable versus nonreactivatable infections. In 60% of steroid-treated, irnmune cats, restoration of anti-FeLV responses leads to suppression ol viremia and recovery. The remaining 00% become persistently viremic and die of FeLV-retated diseases (Rojko et al., 1982) . That their FOCMA titers drop from those seen in regressor cats to those seen in corticosteroidtreated progressors probably indicates both in vivo consumption and suppression of adequate humora! response.\n\nIt has been speculated that corticosteroids induce reactivation by shifting the marrow macrophage/FeLV relationship from nonpermissive to permissive. Substantiatin~g data has been provided by in vitro steroid treatment of marrow, peritoneal rnacrophages, node and PBML (Rojko et al., 1982a) . With hydrocortisone treatment, previously nonpermissive peritoneal macrophages reactivate FeLV and marrow macrophage reactivation is enhanced 2-3-fold. Reactivation oJ~ FeLV is associated with induction of cytoplasmic p27 in t5-30% (mean 21%) of untreated regressor cat bone rnarrow cells and 20-32% (mean 25%) of CS-treated marrow cells. It has been concluded that the steroid amplification o[ viral production is due to increased viral replication in a fixed population (20-25%) of marrow ceils that harbor FeLV infection.\n\nMaternal immunity does not protect against congenital exposure to FeLV-R or FeLV-KT (Rojko et al., 19g2a; Hoover et al., i993) . Reactivatable FeLV also has been found in cultured marrow and thymus of congenitally exposed kittens born to regressor queens.\n\nPassive colostral transfer of maternal FeLV-neutra]izing antibody to suckling neonates (Hoover et al., 1977) likely is responsible for maintenance of the neonatal infection in its nonproductive, but reactivatable, form (Rojko et al., 19g2a) . The reactivation of FeLV from marrow, but not tumor cultures, of ~, of g cats with FeLV-negative Iymphomas has been interpreted as evidence that FeLV may be a factor in nonproducer Iymphomagenesis.\n\nPossible mechanisms of nonproducer lymphomagenesis are discussed in Section III.C.3. (Cotter et al., 1975) . In other preleukemic or leukemic cats in nature, clinical manifestations of immunomodulation include peripheral lymphopenia, thymicolymphoid atrophy, circulating immune complexes, hypocomplementemia, and membranous glomerulonephritis or periglomerular fibrosis (Anderson et ah, 1971; Essex et al., 1975; Kobilinsky et ah, 1979; Jakowski et al., 19g0; 3ones et aJ., 1980) . Thymicolymphoid depletion, therefore~ was attributed to altered traffic of thymocyte precursors from marrow to thymus, and altered traffic of mature thymocytes to splenic and nodal paracortex. It is unlikely that impairment of cell-mediated immunity is due only to the absence of the thymus as thymectomy of weanling kittens does not lead to alterations in skin graft rejection or lymphocyte blastogenesis (Hoover et aJ., 197g) .\n\nEvidence is accumulating that the immunoabrogation induced by FeLV is T-cell specific. With the onset of viremia, experimentally exposed cats also Jose their capacity to respond to the T-lymphocyte mJtogens concanavalin A (con A) and phytohemagglutin (PHA) and the antigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KL]-I) (Cockerell et ah, 1976a,b,c Persistently infected neutrophils also display normal chemotaxis and bacterial killing.\n\nThe adduction of T-cell specificity also is supported by recent observations that naturally viremic pet cats make ineffective lgG responses to the synthetic polypeptide multichain (L-tyrosine-L-glutamic acid)-poly-DL-alanine-poiy-L-lysine, denoted TGAL, as determined by enzyme-lined immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Trainin et al., 19g3) . to those of regressor cats (Mathes and Olsen, 19gl) . In viremic cats, however, low levels of lgM antibodies reactive with the surface of FL-74 cells arise early in~ and persist throughout, preleukemia (Mathes and Qlsen, 19gl) . Thus, a putative T-helper defect may be assigned to cats with persistent, productive FeLV infection. FeLV-induced immunosuppression may provide a model for the specific impairment of OKT-4 positive T-helper cells observed following infection of human cells with the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV, Miyoshi et al., 1981; Poiesz et al., 1981; Popovic et al., 1982; see Sections V.I,3) .\n\nare predisposed to diseases such as Coomb's positive anemia and membranous glomerulonephritis which may be precipitated by suppressor cell dysfunction. This aspect of FeLV-related immunosuppression has been studied by evaluating suppressor cell function in vitro (Stiff and Olsen, 1982) . The technique involves the elimination of T-suppressor cells by short-term incubation (2t~ hours) in vitro. After incubation, the lymphocytes are treated with mitogen and then cultured as a typical lymphocyte blastogenesis test.\n\nNormal feline peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes demonstrate t~-fold increases in DNA synthesis (p .005) in response to suboptimal concentrations of con A (0.1 ug/well) added at 2t~ hours relative to cells stimulated at 0 hours. Increased DNA synthesis by cells aged 2t~ hours in vitro is interpreted to mean attenuation of normal suppression consequent to preincubation. In contrast, when cells from viremic cats are incubated for 24 hours, a significant increase in con A stimulation is not observed (Stiff and Qlsen, 1982) . This suggests that viremic cats lack circulating suppressor cells or that these cells are not functioning as those in normal cats with normal peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes. Interestingly, viremic cats develop depressed circulating, spontaneous suppressor cell activity concomitant with the redistribution of Fc P. and T-cells to the mesenteric lymph nodes (Rojko et al., 1979a; Rojko et al., 1983b) . Furthermore, naturally-occurring, short-lived cells in the peripheral blood of FeLV-naive cats are known to restrict FeLV replication under conditions of in vitro exposure (Rojko et al., 1979a ; see Section llI.A.l.b). Clearly, this inverse relationship between virus production and suppressor cell activity demands further attention.\n\nb. Effects of killed FeLV and virion structural components on the immune system The initial evidence that abrogation of immune responses might be the property of feline retrovirai structural components has been provided by Schaller et al. (1977) . In In addition to causing tumor enhancement and abrogating tumor immunity in vivo, inactivated FeLV interferes drastically with lymphocyte function in vivo. Incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from FeLV-naive cats with serum from viremic cats or with ultraviolet-treated FeLV in vitro causes loss of lymphocyte reactivity to T-cell mitogens (Cockerell et al., 1976; Mathes et al., 197g; Hebebrand et al., 1979) and allogeneic leukocytes (Stiff and Olsen, 1983) , and depression of lymphocyte membrane lectin receptor mobility (Dunlap et al., 1979; Lewis and Olsen, 1983 (Hebebrand et al., i979; Dunlap et al., 1979; Lewis and Olsen, 19g3) .\n\nTo Purified FeLV pIS(E)) has been shown to be suppressive to the mitogen-induced LBT at a concentration of 0.2 ug/well Hebebrand et al., 1979) . . This profile is similar to those produced by cats that possess progressive FeLV/FeSV tumors or persistently viremic cats.\n\nInterest in the biologic effect of FeLV pIS(E) on the lymphocyte functions of animal hosts other than cats has been stimulated by its resemblance to the 15,000 dalton envelope protein of murine leukemia virus (MuLV plS(E)) (Ikeda and Wright, 1975) . FeLV pIS(E) possesses remarkable interspecies antigenic reactivity distinct from interspecies determinants on FeLV p27, suggesting that FeLV plS(E) is a highly conserved protein and that its biologic properties should not be restricted to its homotypic host (cat).\n\nSubsequent studies revealed that FeLV pI3(E) depresses blastogenesis to mitogens and antigens in PBML of nearly all normal human donors (Hebebrand et al., 1979) . FeLV pIO(E) also markedly inhibits con A capping in human PBML (Hebebrand et al., 1979; Dunlap et al., 1979; Lewis and Olsen, 1983) . Moreover, canine and bovine but not equine PBML are permissive to FeLV repression of mitogen-induced blastogenesis. These studies clearly indicate that FeLV p15(E) can cross species barriers to abrogate lymphocyte proliferation and membrane receptor mobility.\n\nRecent reports (Copelan et al., 1983 ) reveal a mechanism for inactivated FeLV-and FeLV-derived, plO(E)-induced repression of lymphocyte blastogenesis. They examine factors that contribute to maximal T-cell proliferation in reaction to con A. Such factors include the production of interleukin 1 (IL-1) by accessory monocytes, the secretion of interleukin 2 (1L-2, T-cell growth factor -TGCF) by con A-activated T-cells, and the recruitment of secondary T-cell targets in response to interleukin 1 and TCGF.\n\nUsing standard assays, monocyte-depleted T-cell populations require the addition of autologous monocytes or their biologic product, interleukin 1, to attain maximal blastogenesis. Preincubation of monocytes with inactivated-FeLV does not abrogate their ability to restore blastogenesis to monocyte depleted PBML~ nor does it diminish their secretion of interleukin 1 in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Furthermore, the interleukin I produced by FeLV-treated monocytes is fully effective in initiating tritiated thymidine incorporation by human T cells or mouse thymocytes. Lastly, the addition of autologous monocytes to FeLV-suppressed lymphocytes results in partial reversal of lymphocyte suppression (Copelan et al., 1983) . Whether this protective effect resides in the ability of monocytes to degrade or entrap FeLV plS(E) or to secrete factors which protect the T-cell membrane from FeLV p13(E) damage is not known.\n\nThe failure of FeLV plS(E) to depress interleukin 1 production by, and accessory function of, human monocytes in vitro is reminiscent of its failure to induce dysfunction in cat monocytes (macrophages) in vitro and in vivo Rojko et al.~ 1993b Of more relevance to the mechanism of lymphosuppression is the dramatic decrease in the secretion of, and response to~ TCGF in FeLV-and plS(E)-treated PBML (Copelan et al., 19S3) .\n\nIn these experiments, monocyte-depleted, T-cells are incubated with interleukin 1 and con A and their supernatants tested for TCGF. indicate that only prostaglandins of the E series are effective depressors of blastogenesis alone (40-50% suppression) or effective depressors in conjunction with FeLV plS(E) (12% suppression). Prostaglandin E2, however, reverses FeLV-induced capping deficits. Two known cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, indomethacin and nordihydroguararetic acid (NDGA), reverse the plS(E) suppression of the con A receptor capping mechanism and the con A blastogenic responses. NDGA (1 uM) and indomethacin (0.1-1 uM) reverse suppression when ]ymphocytes are obtained from viremic donors exposed to FeLV plS(E) in vitro Lewis et al., 1983a ). An inhibition of prostacyclin synthetase, tranylcypromine, and an inhibitor of thromboxane synthetase, imidazole, are without effect. In studies of normal human donors and patients with immunosuppressive disorders, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors have been shown to enhance mitogen responsiveness (Goodwin and Webb, 19g0) . Reversal of immunosuppression probably is due to inhibition of PGE 2 production which has been correlated positively with suppressor cell activity. Regarding the latter, Lewis et al. (1993a) accumulations of cyclic AMP in reaction to con A (Lewis and Olsen, 1993) . Second, phosphodiesterase inhibitors which promote intracellular increments in cyclic AMP by prohibiting its catabolism do not protect lymphocytes from FeLV suppression nor do they enhance intracellular cyclic AMP levels in lymphocytes co-exposed to FeLV plS(E) and\n\ncon A (Lewis and Olsen, 1993) . All things considered, it is highly plausible that the original action of FeLV plS(E) at or in the cell membrane is to block the triggering of the Ca++/calmodulin-dependent activation of adenylate cyclase. Alternatively, the insertion of this hydrophobic bulky plS(E) may block microtubule and membrane function by a space-occupying mechanism alone. The codepressive effect of PGE 2 on FeLV suppression of lectin responses most likeJy is associated with enhanced blocking at or in the membrane. Failure of generation of the second messenger (yclic AMP leads to failure of transmission of the message to proliferate or to undergo capping in response to the lectin signal.\n\nPreleukemic erythroid aplasia is second only to immunosuppression as a cornmon manifestation of FeLV viremia in naturally infected cats (Cotter et al., 1975) .\n\nExperimentaJ inoculation of immature (Hoover et al., 197z~; Mackey et al., 1975; Boyce et al., 1981; Onions et al., 1982; Testa et al., 1983) or corticosteroid-suppressed adult cats with anemiagenic subgroup C FeLVs (FeLV-KT, FeLV-Sarma) leads to progressive nonregenerative anemia and death with 10-16 weeks. Packed cell volumes of 5 to 15\u00b06 reflect severe depletion of marrow erythroid precursors and a shift in the mean myeloid:erythroJd (M:E) ratio from 1.6 in normal, age-matched controls to 10.O in anemic cats (Boyce et al., 1981) . Lymphopenia, severe paracortical lymphoid depletion, thymic atrophy and cachexia are invariable (Hoover et al., 197/4; Mackey et al., 1975) . Anemia and lymphoid depletion may be accompanied by pancytopenia, medullary fibrosis or osteosclerosis, and hemorrhagic enteritis Mackey et al., 1975) .\n\nShortening of the erythrocyte lifespan in preanemic and anemic cats may contribute to the severity of the anemia (Hoover eta!., 197L~), but probably is minor compared to the profound selective loss of erythroid precursors early in the preanemic period (Boyce et al., 1981; Onions et al., 1982; Testa et al., 1983) .\n\nRecently, colony-forming assays (Fig. 2) for feline marrow erythroid, myelomonocytic and fibroblastic precursors have been used to investigate the pathogenesis ot this preleukemic red cell hypoplasia. Marrow cultures from FeLVc-infected cats show selective depression of erythropoiesis with minimally altered granulopoiesis (Boyce et al., 1981; Onions et al., 1982; Testa et al., i983) . Relatively mature erythroid precursors, designated CFU E (colony-forming units-erythroid) decrease by 3-5 weeks after exposure (WAE) prior to the onset of anemia (5WAE) (Boyce et al., 1981) . More dramatic is the rapid fall of primitive erythroid precursors, designated BFU E (burst-forming unitserythroid) to 25% of that in uninfected, age-matched controls by i WAF and to 10% by 2 WAE and thereafter (Testa et al., 1983) . In FeLVc-infected, preanemic and anemic cats, myelomonocytic precursors (CFUGM) usually are unaffected but sometimes are increased transiently (Boyce et al., 1981) . Four of 5 cats also have 3-7-fold increases in colonies of fibroblast-like, nonmacrophagic cells attached to the surface of the culture dish (Testa et al., 1983) . This may be the in vitro equivalent of the in vivo capacity to develop rnyelofibrosis (Hoover et al., 197L~) .\n\nThese severe decreases in BFU E and CFU E following viral infection mimic those seen in human apJastic anemias of idiopathic origin and are distinct from the arrested maturation described for anemias induced by Friend and Rauscher murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs).\n\nIn the mouse anemias, maturation blocks occur relatively late in erythrogenesis and are reflected in enhanced CFU E and BFU E numbers. Hankins (1983) has demonstrated elegantly that both anemiagenic and polycythemiagenic strains of Friend virus directly trigger the polyclonal expansion of the EPO-positive BFU E. In Rauscher anemias (de Both et al., 1980) , the erythrocyte lifespan is reduced drasticaUy, thereby worsening the anemia. The most primitive erythroid precursor assayable is the burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFUE). BFU E are large colonies with multiple subunits that arise after 7 to 10 days, and are focused around a central nurse macrophage. BFU E probably require cellto-cell contact for their development, are sensitive to high levels of EPO, and absolutely require BPA produced by the central marrow adherent macrophage. In the earliest phase of BFU E generation, T-cells likely trigger the release of BPA from the marrow adherent cell. The colonyforming unit-erythroid CFU E represents a more mature (committed) erythroid precursor. CFU E are smaller than BFUE, arise earlier in culture (2 to 5 days), and are sensitive to low levels of EPO. The myelomonocytic precursor assayed is a committed stem cell with the potential for granulocytic or monocytic differentiation and is designated the colony forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage (CFUGM). Certain cultured cell lines, macrophages, urine, and endotoxin-activated serum serve as sources of colony stimulating factors necessary for myelomonocytic colony formation in methyl cellulose.\n\nThe mechanisms that underlie this specific erythroalteration by subgroup C FeLV are not known. In man and the mouse, culture of colony-forming bematopoietic cells has identified stem cell defects, mJcroenvironrnental disorders and lymphoreticular/hematopoietic cell interactions as pathogenetic in aplastic anemia (Camitta et al., 1982) . Tile sustained myelornonocytic precursor activity in FeLV-infected anemic and preanemic cats implies a viable pluripotent stem cell with capacity for myelomonocytic differentiation.\n\nThis argues against a FeLV-induced stem cell defect and for a committed erythroid precursor defect.\n\nA simple explanation might reside in a simple deficiency of the erythrostimulatory growth factor, erythropoietin (EPO), in the face of normal levels of colony stimulating factors (CSFs) that favor myelopoiesis. BFU E and CFU E require EPO for clonal expansion, maturation and hemoglobinization; and BF/I E are sensitive only to high levels of EPO. That FeLV induces a simple EPO deficiency, however, is improbable because FeLV anemic cat marrow is refractory to exogenous EPO in vitro and FeLV anemic cats have elevated plasma EPO levels in vivo (Hoover et al., 1970) .\n\nIt is more plausible that impairment of feline erythroid (:ell growth by FeLV C may involve viral-induced inhibition of cell proliferation or host immunopathologic reactions against FeLV-infected progenitors. Evidence for a direct antiproliferative effect is found when bone marrow cells from FeLV-naive cats are exposed to various strains of FeLV in vitro and assayed for CFUE, BFUE, and CFfJGM in methyl cellulose (Testa et al., 1983; Rojko et al., 1983a) . Exposure to FeLV C (Sarma), FeLVAB C (KT), or FeLVAB (Ohio State Rickard FeLV) but not FeLV A (Glasgow Rickard FeLV) effects z;0-75% reductions in CF/I E and P, FU E. Alterations in CFUGM relative to sham-inoculated controls are minor.\n\nParallel liquid cultures assayed for viability, cell number and cell-associated incorporation of tritiated thymidine show that this specific; erythrodepression is independent of any cytotoxic effect. In vitro suppression is correlated positively with iMectivity of the input virus and with virus replication by inoculated marrow. Inactivation of FeLV by heat or ultraviolet light leads to restoration of CFU E to sham-inoculated levels, lmmunofluorescence for FeLV p27 and cytologic studies indicate that the majority of the replicating virus recovered from suppressed cultures is produced by rnyelomonocytie progenitor cells (Rojko et al., 1983a) .\n\nThese data indicate that both anemiagenic and lymphornagenic feline retroviruses cause reductions in erythrogenesis in vitro. The requirement for infectious virus in vitro and erythrospecifieity in vivo and in vitro are reminiscent of the Friend MuLV anemia/poJyeythemia system where infectious virus induces BFU E and enhances erythrogenesis (Hankins, 1983) . Furthermore, interaction between hemopoietic cells and infectious virus probably is prerequisite to anemia induction in vivo. In this regard, the early fall in BFU E (1 WAE) in FeLVc-exposed , preanernic cats exactly correlates with the onset of productive infection of marrow progenitor cells (Hoover et al., 1977; Rojko et al., 1979a; Testa et al., 1983) . Similarly, erythroid progenitors produce the Friend-MuLV complex as early as #g hours after exposure in vivo (Hankins, 1983) .\n\ncompelling (Kociba and Wellman, 1983) . In anemic cats, CFU E formation is decreased in the absence of autologous serum and unaffected by its presence. In normal, FeLV-naive cats, neither the inclusion of pooled sera from anemic cats nor the addition of sera from cats hyperimmune to FeLVAB C causes suppression of CFU E.\n\nLastly, when marrow from FeLV-naive cats is cultured with increased amounts of inactivated FeLV, selective decrements in CFU E can be demonstrated. Inclusion of the purified virion component (plS(E) but not p27 in the methyl cellulose culture system also leads to depressed CFU E (Kociba and Wellman, 1983) . The question whether anemiagenesis is due to FeLV gp70, pl3(E), replicating virus, or all three, deserves further study.\n\nIn particular, the known specificity of pI3(E) for T-cell suppressions and the observed BFU E decrements suggest consideration of the effect of FeLV on T-cell-dependent, macrophage secretion of burst-promoting activity (Kociba and Wellman, 1983) .\n\nstudy.\n\nIn particular, the known specificity of plS(E) for T-cell suppressions and the observed BFU E decrements suggest consideration of the effect of FeLV on T-celldependent, macrophage secretion of burst-promoting activity (Kociba and Wellman, 1983 ).\n\nMany of the oncogenic retroviruses, including feline, avian, murine, bovine, gibbon ape and human T-cell leukemia viruses and the murine mammary tumor virus, induce neoplasms only after long latent periods of months to years (reviewed in Gilden and Rabin, 19g2; Weiss, 1983) . With the exception of the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), these viruses do not immortalize cells in vitro (Yamamoto et al., 1992) , nor do they appear to contain viral transforming genes (Gilden and IRabin, 1982) . Often persistence of an intact provirus is not required for the induction or maintenance of the transformed state. Fully one-third of feline lymphomas are negative for FeLV antigens and negative for more sensitive indicators of FeLV proviruses Koshy et al., 1980; Casey et al., 1981) . The currently favored modes on oncogenesis by long latency leukemia viruses include:\n\n(1) Activation of c-onc sequences directly by promoter insertion (Hayward et al., i991) or activation of other transforming genes (Cooper, 1992) indirectly by insertional mutagenesis of a regulatory cellular sequence,\n\n(2) Indirect viral effects in which the virus or viral receptors trigger a series of blastogenic responses mediated by interleukins or hormones but the virus is not the final carcinogen (McGrath et al., 197g; Ihle, 1979,1981) , and\n\nThe generation of highly transforming recombinant viruses with extended host range (Elder et al., 1977) or leukemia accelerating viruses (Nowinski et al., 1977) .\n\nAny proposal that these mechanisms operate in feline leukemogenesis must account for certain observations. First is the negative correlation between lymphoid targets for productive infection and targets for transformation (Cockerell et al., 1976a, b; Rojko et al., 1979a,19gl) in the face of the positive correlation between FeLV viremia and likelihood of neoplasia (see Section II.C.2). Second is the similarity between the potentially cytopathic FeLV B and cytopathic murine recombinant viruses with high leukemogenicity (Elder and MuJlins, 1983) . Third is the role of immunoselection versus immunosuppression in the emergence and expansion of leukemic clones. Penultimate, at present, is the identity of FOCMA and its relationship to virus producer and nonproducer neoplasia. Last is the controversial etiology of nonproducer lymphomas and leukemias.\n\nStudies of the pathogenesis of viremic FeLV infections have established that B-but not T-cell replication of FeLV is a constant feature of preleukemia but that FeLV ultimately transforms T-ceils of marrow or blood origin which migrate to the thymus (Cockerell et aJ., 1976a,b; Rojko et al., 1979a,19gl) . A similar dissociation between virus replication and transformation occurs in Moloney (Lee and IhJe, 1979; Isaak and Cerny, 1993) and AKR murine leukemias (Lee and lhle, 1979) . Eider et al., i977; Lee and lhle, 1979,19gl) or leukemiaaccelerating viruses (Nowinski et al., 1977) . Passive antibody to gp71 will protect mice from T-cell neoplasms only if administered early in preleukemia. The potent oncogens are recombinants between ecotropic AKV produced by nonthyrnocytes and xenotropic virus produced by thymocytes. The cell capable of generating these recombinants has not been identified but the critical role of the thymic nurse cell in Jeukemogenesis in vivo suggests its consideration (Haas, 197g) . The recombination event usually is specific to the env region and the progeny recombinants have gp71 homologous to both xenotropic and ecotropic env gene products. It is known (see Sections II.A.3,II.C.I) that gp71 determines host range and biologic properties and is the target for VN antibody. Host range is extended to include both xenotropic and ecotropic ceils (this is called amphotropism) and the newly evoked cytopathicity for mink cells in lieu of transforming gene capacity has led to the designation mink cell focus-forming (MCF) virus.\n\nMany parallels can be drawn to FeLV leukemogenesis. Passive antibody to FeLV gp70 is protective only if administered within the first 6 DAE (de Noronha et al., 197g) .\n\nSubgroup A FeLVs are long latency leukemia viruses with highly restricted host range.\n\nFeLV A replicates efficiently only in cat cells and some strains will replicate inefficiently in human and canine cells (Sarma and Log, 1973 (Elder et al., 1977) . In this regard, it perhaps is useful to note that the original FeLV A isolate of FeLV-Rickard is weakly leukemogenic, that the Ohio State strain o$ FeLV-R contains both FeLVA and FeLV B and is highly leukemogenic (Hoover et al., 1972) , and that the Glasgow strain of FeLV-R contains FeLV A only and mimics the parental FeLV-R in weak pathogenicity. Moreover, FeLV B is highly cytosuppressive to normal feline marrow and lymphoid cells in vitro (Onions et al., 1980 ; see Section II.C.I). Whether this cytodepressive property is due to a virion pl~(E) effect or due to superinfection with unintegratable, and hence toxic, proviruses similar to that described for cytopathic avian leukemia viruses (We!ler et al., 1980) is not known. The data proposing FeLV B as a MCF-like or leukemia accelerating virus are reinforced by the recent molecular evidence that the nucleotide sequence of the envv gene of FeLV B reveals unique sequence homologies with a murine MCF virus (Elder and Mullins, 1983) .\n\nAlthough not an absolute prerequisite to lymphomagenesis, viremia increases the probability of, and decreases the latent period before, the transtorming event. The leukemogenic event usually is considered to be random, however, a high replicating virus burden increases the probability of new proviral integrations into sensitive sites in sensitive cells.\n\nIn avian bursal lymphomas, these are sequences upstream from the cellular homologue of avian myelocytomatosis virus, the proto-oncogene designated cmyc.\n\nIntegration of proviral LTRs is sufficient to initiate expression of c-myc RNA and induce the transformed phenotype in both virus producer and virus nonproducer cells.\n\nOther lymphomas express cellular transforming genes unrelated to viral transforming genes recognized when their DNA transfected into indicator fibroblasts evokes transformation (Cooper, 1982) . These genes may encode transforming (?) proteins related to the transferrin family. Their induction in bursal lymphomas probably is via downstream promotion or via insertional mutagenesis into regulatory sequences that normally function to ensure their repression. The present evidence for downstream promotion or insertional mutagenesis in FeLV lymphomagenesis is not compelling. Replication-competent proviruses from FeLV-positive lymphomas will cause viral replication but not transformation in NIH 3T3 or feline fibroblasts. Replication-defective proviruses from FeLVpositive tumors and DNA from FeLV-negative tumors cause neither productive infection nor transformation in transfection assays (Casey et al., 1981; Rosenberg et al., 1981) .\n\nis critical to the gp71 specific, immunostimulation of uninfected T-cells in Moloney MuLV leukemogenesis in AKR and BALB/c mice Ihle, 1979,1981) . Target However, it is improbable that all T-cell subsets are restricted equally by pI \u00a7(E) (Rojko et al., 1973b) . Selective depression or antiviral T-effector or T-helper cells (Trainin et al., 19g3) could allow the emergence of neoplastic subsets whose proliferation is unchecked by pIS(E). Furthermore, the specific failure of IgG-FOCMA humoral immunosurveillance (see Section III.B.~) would a]Jow survival of emerging neoplastic cells. Induction of protection FeLV infection in neoplastic:\n\nFeLV provirus could protect the cell frorn NK lysis (Dubey et al., 19g2) .\n\nThe general consensus is that feline hemolymphoreticular and rnesenchymal neoplasms are distinguished by feline oncornavir~s-associated cell membrane antigens (FOCMA). FOCMA-L, expressed by the FeLVABc-producing, feline lyrnphoma line FL7~, is defined by IMI using viremic or immune cat serum, and is the principal target for imrnunosurveillance (see Section IILB.~). Controversy regarding its identification as a nonvirion versus virion encoded protein and tumor-specific-antigen is rampant (see below).\n\nFOCMA-S, generated concomitant with morphologic transformation of cells by the 2 most common strains of FeSV (Snyder-Theilen [ST-Snyder and Theilen, 1969 LZa~g sequences. Transcription of the gag-fes sequences of the integrated FeSV provirus (integration being dependent upon FeLV B help) yields a polycistronic mRNA which is translated into a precursor protein (PS \u00a7-PII0 fes) with protein kinase activity specific for tyrosine residues (Barbacid et al., 19g0; Franchini et al., /ggl; Hampe et al., 1992; Veronese et al., 19g2) . Phosphorylation of proteins in tyrosine is unique to retroviral transforming gene products~ the prototype being the poJyprotein pp60 src translational product of the v-src (and c-src) of the avian Rous sarcoma virus (Collett and Erikson, 197g) . it currently is thought that transformation is due to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of proteins responsible for membrane-mediated regulation of cell shape, adhesion, motility and proliferation. In particular, pp60 src phosphorylates vimentin, a protein that attaches actin to the inner face of the plasma membrane to preserve the normal cytoskeleton. That pp60 src binds and phosphorylates cellular receptors for epidermal growth factor suggests that pp60 src may disturb regulation of cell proliferation.\n\nIn conclusion, FOCMA-S, although heterogeneous, probably is the transforming protein of the feline sarcoma virus and is encoded by transduced cellular genes not helper FeLV sequences.\n\nEarly observations that FOCMA-S and FOCMA-L were antigenically cross-reactive have led to the hypothesis that FeLV induces a c-onc sequence in transformable cells and that the FOCMA-L thus induced was a tumor-specific antigen (Essex eta] ., 1971a,b; Hardy et al., 1977 Hardy et al., ,1980 . This has been strengthened by the apparent dissociation between expression of FOCMA-L and of FeLV structural proteins: (1) FOCMA is not present on nontransformed, FeLV-infected fibroblasts or lymphocytes (Sliski eta]., 1977; Fleissner and Snyder, 1992) , (2) FeLV proteins do not absorb FOCMA activity from naturally occurring viremic cat sera (Essex et al., 1971a,b; Stephenson eta] ., 1977), (3) VN and anti-FOCMA (IMI or CDA) activity in cat sera are not correlated (Essex et al., 1971a,b) and (4) FOCMA is expressed on the surface of nonproducer (p27-negative) feline lymphoma cells . Furthermore~ a 707000 dalton protein immunoprecipitated from FeLV-negative lymphoma cells has been shown to have a tryptic peptide map analogous to a 70,000 dalton protein of FL74 (FeLV-positive Iymphoma) origin (Fleissner and Snyder, 19g2) .\n\nMore recent observations cast doubt on the relationship between FOCMA-L and FOCMA-S and consider that FOCMA-L expression correlates with expression of FeLV C gp70 epitopes and not the transformed phenotype. First are the observations that the FeSV-encoded polyproteins on nonproducer mink cells cannot be immunoprecipitated by FOCMA antibody-positive sera from either regressor or naturally viremic cats (Barbacid et al., 19g0) . Also, neither these sera nor reference monospecific antisera to the v-fes gene product immunoprecipitate proteins from FL74 cells with protein kinase activity and viremic cat sera with IM] FOCMA-L activity usually are negative for FOCMA-S by IMI assay Vedbrat et al., 1983) . Second, FOCMA-L expression is strong on FeLV-KT (FeLVABC)-infected , feline embryo fibroblasts and human lymphocytes (Essex et al., 1972; . The most impressive evidence is found in recent reports by Vedbrat et al. (1993) . FOCMA antibody-positive sera from naturally viremic cats react with FeLV C gp70 epitopes expressed by budding virus at the cell surface of feline lymphomas and FeLVc-infected fibroblasts. The identity of those epitopes as FeLV gp70 comes from extensive analysis using monoclonal antibodies to FOCMA-L and FeLV C gp70.\n\nThe identification of FOCMA-L as the translational product of FeLV C env sequences poses an apparent dilemma. Lymphoma-inducing FeLVs usually are subgroup A or AB not C. The prototype lymphomagenic FeLV-R produced by the feline lymphoma ceil line (F~22) is FeLV A and fibroblasts infected with F~22 virus do not express FOCMA-L or FeLV C antigens. However, the parental F~22 cells do express FeLV C gp70 on virions incompletely budded at the plasma membrane (Vedbrat et al., 1983) FeLV C that will absorb the activity of monoclonal antibody to FOCMA-L or FeLV C gp70.\n\nMonoclonais further distinguish three antigenic determinants of the FeLV C gp70 molecule.\n\nMonoclonal 3192A recognizes antigens expressed on budding virus and cell membranes that are masked or altered in mature virions and are cross reactive with most cat antisera to FOCMA. Monoclonal B12/C3 discriminates epitopes restricted to infectious FeLV C virions, and monoclonal 2-i24/2-88 identifies epitopes common to infectious and noninfectious FeLV C particles.\n\nEven if FOCMA-L is a virally-encoded and not cell-derived antigen and even if it is expressed by FeLVc-infected fibroblasts in vitro, it still is the antigen that evokes protective immunity to progressive FeLV-induced tumors in vivo. Grant and Michalek (1981) argue that FOCMA-L is not a single epitope and that complement-dependent, cytotoxic antibodies to FOCMA present in the sera of naturally infected pet cats specify unique and cross-reacting antigens on individual tumors. It will be extremely interesting to see how the epitopes identified by monoclonals to FeLV C in vitro con@are with the epitopes identified in vivo by naturally infected cats. The observation that noninfectious FeLV C particles shed by F~22 cells will absorb FOCMA-L activity from naturally infected pet cat sera makes it important to consider if soluble FOCMA-L known to be secreted by spent FL7t~ cells in vitro (Heding et al., 1976) and by both viremic and nonviremic cats (Lutz et al., 1980; Saxinger et al., I980) in vivo also is identical to noninfectious FeLV C gp70. This particularly is relevant because soluble FOCMA serves as the primary immunogen in the highly protective FeLV vaccines scheduled for commercial release in the near future (Heding et ah, 1976) .\n\nThe expression of FeLV C env genes in infected fibroblasts in vitro is not necessarily relevant to the expression of FOCMA-L by hemolyrnphoreticular cells in vivo. Fibroblasts are not commonly infected in cats (Rojko et ah, 1979a ) Since cats exposed to FeLV in vivo usually develop antibodies to FOCMA-L, FOCMA-L must be expressed in both nonviremic and viremic cats in vivo. Rice and Olsen (1982) Several lines of evidence suggest that FeLV leukemogenesis is not restricted to cats with productive FeLV infection. Virus-negative lymphomas account for 29% of all feline LSA and occur after protracted latency periods in older cats (Hardy et al., i977,1980) .\n\nMost cats with virus-negative, FOCMA-positive lymphomas originate from FeLV-infected households .\n\nOther virus-negative lymphomas have been described in FeLV-exposed kittens rendered regressors by passive immunotherapy (de Noronha et al., 1978) and complement-dependent FOCMA antibody is protective against nonproducer leukemia (Grant et al., 1980a,b) .\n\nVirus-negative leukemic cats have circulating immune complexes which contain viral p27, gp70 and reverse transcriptase (Day et al., 19g0; 3ones et al., 1980; Snyder et al., 1982) .\n\nMoreover, sixty percent of nonviremic cats with lymphoma do have low levels of serum p27 (Saxinger et al., 1982) and other nonviremic, preleukemic cats have intermittent marrow FOCMA-L expression long after regression of acute infection . Lastly, strong evidence implicating FeLV in the genesis of nonproducer lymphoma has been provided by the demonstration that 4 of 8 cats with virus-negative lymphomas and leukemias have latent, reactivatable bone marrow infections with FeLV (Rojko et al., 1982a) .\n\nThe arguments against FeLV involvement in nonproducer lymphomagenesis also are weighty. Nonproducer (NP) lymphomas are heterogeneous in morphology, tissue distribution, epidemiology, and virology. NP tumors usually are multicentric, alimentary or leukemic and not thymic in origin (Hardy et al., 19g0 ) and a relatively high proportion bear Slg or null cell markers . Also included are myelomonocytic leukernias (Madewell and 3arrett, 1983) , erythemic myelosis, large granular lymphocytic leukemias, eosinophilic leukemias, systemic mastocytosis and cutaneous mycosis fungioides Rojko et al., 1983b) . Nonproducer lymphomas and leukemias need not originate in cats from FeLV-endemic, multiple cat households, and often occur randomly. Furthermore, FeLV-negative tumors often carry other retroviral information, particularly foamy (feline syncytial), endogenous FeLV and RDII4 proviruses (Casey et al., 1981) .\n\nSpecific evidence contrary to the involvement of FeLV in nonproducer lymphomas includes the absence of cytoplasmic p27, surface gp70, and replicating FeLV from tumor and nontumor cells (Hardy et al., 1977,19g0; Koshy et al., 19g0; Saxinger et al., 19g0; Casey et al., 19gl; Rojko et al., 1982a; Madewell and 3arrett, 1983; Vedbrat et al., 1983) .\n\nFour of 7 nonproducer lymphomas are negative for surface FOCMA-L and FeLV C gpY0 epitopes identified by monoclonal antibodies (Vedbrat et al., 1983) . Furthermore, t~ of 8 nonproducer lymphomas did not have reactivatable, marrow origin FeLV (Madewell and 3arrett, 1983; Rojko et al., 1983b) . In studies employing DNA and cloned probe hybridization, NP tumor cells are negative for complementary DNA to FeLV RNA (Koshy et al., 19g0) and absolutely devoid of exogenous FeLV-specific U 3 (LTR) sequences (Casey et al., 19gl) . Absence of exogenous U 3 sequences means that the NP cells never integrated FeLV proviruses and, therefore, never experienced horizontally transmitted infection. Furthermore, the reactivation of FeLV from NP marrows does not necessitate a role for FeLV in NP lymphomagenesis. It may be that the presence o5 an overwhelming tumor burden leads to stress-induced, corticosteroid-triggered (Rojko et al., 19g2a) , marrow FeLV recrudescence.\n\nIf the assumption that FeLV is associated with the etiology of NP lymphoma is correct, the lack of exogenous U 3 sequences in tumor cells would suggest that intact FeLV provirus is not required for initiation of transformation. Similar \"hit and run\" mechanisms are described for in vitro transformation of (:ells by Rous sarcoma virus and\n\nHerpes Simplex Virus where progressive loss of virus genomes is accompanied by transformation (reviewed in Gilden and Rabin, 1982) . Support for this premise comes from analysis of U 3 LTR sequences in tumor ceils from cats with FeLV-positive ]yrnphomas (Casey et al., 1981) . Exogenously acquired proviruses in some tumors may demonstrate a simple U 3 hybridization pattern with a discrete number of single-copy provirus-host junction fragments. ]n these tumors, acquisition of provirus may be responsible for tumor initiation. Alternatively, cells with this pattern may be selected for during clonal expansion.\n\nIn other FeLV-positive tumors, proviral integration is independent of the transforming event. The great diversity of proviral sequences has been interpreted to mean that transformation of uninfected cells precedes superinfection by exogenous FeLV (Casey eta] ., 19gl).\n\nThe socioepidemiologic factors that influence the FeLV/cat relationship have been subject to thorough discussion elsewhere (Benveniste et al., 1975) shows that these viruses diverged 1 to 10 million years ago. At that time, ancestral cats were confined to the arid reaches of Northern Africa and rat-to-cat transmission (transfection?) of retroviral information is thought to have been consequent to a prey-to-predator relationship. Whether the cat bit the rat or the rat bit the cat is lost to history. The prevailing climatic aridity and natural feline independence probably restricted horizontal transmission for many years.\n\nThe infertility of viremic queens (Cotter et al., 197~; Hoover et al., 1983 ) ensured a low prevalence of congenital transmission. To this day, antisocial feral cats are protected from exposure to this readily inactivated virus (Francis et al., 1977) . The incidence of exposure of free-ranging, minimally domesticated cats in India to FeLV is extremely low.\n\nDomestication and, in particular, congregation of cats in multiple cat household (MCH) has favored the cat-to-cat transmission of FeLV and its permanent residence in the MCH in lieu of FeLV test and removal programs . Feline behavioral instincts (licking, grooming, etc.) and the communal water dishes and litter pans found in MCH provide protective moisture for FeLV and allow its efficient horizontal transmission between social cats. After exposure, most cats are able to resist progression of FeLV replication by initiating local or systemic lymphoreticular containment (see Section\n\nIIl.g.ll) but \u00a76-80% of these immune cats will retain latent FeLV proviruses in marrow or lymphoid (:ells. The eventual consequence of increasing FeLV prevalence in MCH is the emergence of FeLV viremias and FeLV-related diseases. This emergence may be precipitated by overcrowding, stress, or intercurrent infection which also are concentrated in the MCH environment. It is not surprising, therefore, that the first recognition of the viral etiology of feline lymphomas was subsequent to the isolation of a cell-free, transmissible, viral agent from a cattery in Glasgow with a high frequency of alimentary and thymic lymphomas and other diseases. Other naturally occurring and experimentally stimulated MCH have provided evidence for the horizontal transmission of FeLV and the MCH influences on viremia, immunity, and producer and nonproducer FeLV-related diseases have been documented extensively. The reader is referred elsewhere for details .\n\nMuch has been made of the predisposition of FeLV viremic cats to develop intercurrent viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections (Cotter et al., 1975) . While the role of FeLV plS(E)-mediated immunosuppression and thymicolymphoid depletion cannot be overstated (see Section III.C.l), other factors demand consideration. MCH often are hotbeds of feline pathogen activity. Cats that attend shows or are permitted to roam return to introduce new pathogens which are assimilated readily into the relatively' vulnerable populations. If the household contains kittens with incomplete immunocompetence, the pathogens may become fulminant. In particular, a virus often found in MCH with a special tropism for the lymphoreticular tissues of KeLV viremic cats is the feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FIPV) (Cotter et al., 197~; Horzineck and Osterhaus, 1979) . It has been reported that 50% of cats with fatal FIPV infections concurrently are viremic with FeLV. The salient clinicopathologic features of progressive FIPV infections include hypergammaglobulinemia, immune complex (antigen, IgC, C3) deposition in renal glomeruli, vessels and elsewhere and indicated excessive immunostimulation (and, hence, ineffective regulatory cell activity). Whether a specific Tsuppressor defect induced by FeLV allows progression of immune-mediated FIPV disease is not known. An alternative explanation for the frequent association between the two diseases is that FIPV-induced polyclonal activation of FekV-replicating lymphoid subsets might Iacilitate the in vivo reactivation of FeLV from latently inlected cats.\n\nAnother virus of possible relevance is the feline panleukopenia virus. Although excellent attenuated viral vaccines currently are marketed, the ramifications of routine vaccination of viremic or latently infected cats have not been studied. Regarding the latter, the association of recurrent canine distemper virus infections with exposure to canine parvoviruses cannot be discounted (Krakowka et al., 1982) . Like canine parvovirus, feline panleukopenia virus has pronounced tropism for the lymphohernatopoietic tissues (Carlson et aL, ] 97g) and may initiate transient or protracted lymphornyeloid dysfunction.\n\nThe major importance of the FeLV/cat model is as a tool to specify naturally.\n\noccurring and experimentally' demonstrable pathogenetic factors which independently, regulate virus replication and virus-associated cytosuppressive or cytoproliferative disease. Infection with FeLV is highly reproducible and prospective studies can be conducted in animals expected to undergo acute, persistent, productive, and latent infections during a prescribed period of time.\n\nThe interdependence of immune responsiveness and the subsequent development of cancer is accepted generally. Whether irnmunosuppression precedes neoplasia or whether neoplasia causes immunosuppression remains controversial. There is little doubt, however, that the emergence and clonal expansion of neoplastic (:ells in vivo must be accompanied by escape from normal surveillance. In several animal models, retroviruses have been identified as the cause of lymphohematopoietic neoplasia. These viruses are associated with a dramatic loss of immunocompetence shortly after infection (see Section III.C.I).\n\nThe feline system is of particular interest because immunosuppression is initiated by virus infection and precedes detectable neoplastic transformation by months (Perryman et al., 1972; Hoover et al., 1973; Cockerell et al., 1976a,b,c) . In fact, the most frequent cause of death in naturally FeLV virernic cats is FeLV-associated bacterial or viral infection (Cotter et al., 1975; Essex et al., i975b) . The profound depressions in ceil-mediated immunity facilitate the establishment and progression of otherwise innocuous opportunists (Perryman et al., 1972; Hoover eta]., 1973; Cockerell et al., 1976a,b,c) . The depression apparently is specific to T-cells and particularly' T-helper (Trainin et al., 1993) and T-suppressor (Stiff and Olsen; cells. The failure of Thelper cells probably leads to ineffective humoral surveillance of FOCMA-bearing preneoplastic or neoplastic cells. Immunomodulation is favored by high levels of viremia which ensure that uninfected T-cells are exposed to the virion envelope component pIO(E). This immunosuppressive virion component alters production and reception of Tcell growth regulatory factors (Copelan eta[., 1993) and, in its capacity as a hydrophobic surface protein, probably inserts itself into the plasma membrane of T-cells and alters intracellular messages influenced by the cyclic nucleotide and prostaglandin systems Lewis et al., 1983) .\n\nIn addition to its usefulness as an animal model for the generalized lymphosuppression found in cancer, intensive study of the mechanisms of immunosuppress~on in viremic cats should provide information relevant to the immunosuppression that accompanies human retrovira] infections. Humans in HTLV-endemic areas have a high incidence of pneumonia and filariasis.\n\nThe HTLV-transformed cell has a T-helper phenotype, and HTLV probably infects only T-helper and T-suppressor cells (Miyoshi et al., 1981; Poiesz et al., 1981; Popovic et al., 1982) . Most importantly, it has been observed recently that HTLV may provoke or assist the specific T-helper loss that defines the acquired irnmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and predisposes to death via Kaposi's sarcoma, Pneumocystis pneumonia or other opportunistic pathogens (reviewed in Francis et al., 1983 ).\n\nThe etiologies and pathogenesis of human aplastic anemias remain obscure. The disease is characterized by selective loss of erythroid progenitors without maturation arrest in vivo and by severe decreases in BFI.I E and CffU E assayable in vitro. Considered contributory to the pathogenesis are stem cell defects, disorder microenvironments, and abnormal lymphoreticular/hematopoietic cell interactions (Camitta et al., 1982) . A re(ent report ol a human parvovirus-like virus with profound erythrosuppressive effects in vivo and in vitro adds viruses to the list of potential pathogenetic factors (Mortimer et al., 1983) . The most (ritical cell appears to be the primitive erythroid progenitor, the BF'UE, which is dependent on high levels of erythropoietic (EPO) and on burst-promoting activity (BPA) for its proliferation, clonal expansion, and hemoglobinization. BPA is thought to be produced by marrow accessory rnacrophages by a T-cell dependent process.\n\nLymphoma and Leukemia l~,esearchers have long recognized an etiologic relationship between oncogenic retroviruses and the development of leukemias, lymphomas, and sarcomas in nonhuman species (for review~ see Rabin~ 1992~ Weiss et al.~ 1993) . Two cogent implications o1 retroviruses in tile induction of human leukemias have been provided recently: (1) Cellular genes analogous to retroviral onc genes which are present and frequently transcribed in human tumor cells can induce fibroblast transformation as demonstrated by transfection assay (Cooper, 1992) and may be activated by translocation subsequent to EBV-induced lymphoproliferation in vivo (Klein, 1983) and (2) lymphoblast. HTLV has a marked tropism /or T-helper and T-suppressor lymphocytes identified by monoclonal antisera (Miyoshi et al., 19gl~ Poiesz et al., 19gl~ Popovic et al.~ 1982~ Gotoh et al., 1982 . Exposure of freshly isolated~ HTLV-naive human cord blood lymphocytes to cell-free HTLV initiates persistent nonproductive HTLV infection. These growth relative to sham-infected controls (Rojko et al., 19gl) .\n\nMore vital is the use of the feline model to document the humoral and cellular surveillance of productively and latently infected cells in vivo. In particular, the factors influencing oncogenic virus latency mandate further description in light of recent observations that people immune to the prospective human oncogen HTLV remain latently infected with HTLV (Gotoh et al., 1992) . Data generated in the FeLV/feline lymphoma model may be generalizable to other human infections in which latent/reactivatable viruses are associated with the development of cancer."}
