{"title": "Correlation between electrical properties and cation distribution in [(Ni x Mn 1-x ) 0.84 Cu 0.16 ] 3 O 4 thin films prepared by metal-organic decomposition for microbolometer applications", "body": "Since the beginning of the 21st century, there has been growing interest in infra-red (IR) sensors, as IR imaging cameras are a key device to detect and block acute epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, Influenza A, Ebola, middle east respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus at an early stage.\n\nCompared with cooled detectors, uncooled microbolometers are the most preferred IR imagers due to several significant advantages, such as their low cost, low power consumption, room-temperature operation, compactness, high durability, and light weight [1] . Thus far, various sensing materials for uncooled microbolometers have been studied. Among them, vanadium oxide is the most widely used given its high temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR; >2.5%/K) and low-cost preparation methods [1, 2] . However, this material shows a narrow operating temperature window due to the semiconductor-metal transition at~67\u00b0C, as well as difficulty in controlling the precise composition during deposition [2] [3] [4] .\n\nRecently, various efforts have been made to find alternative bolometer-sensing materials. Spinel materials based on nickel manganite are one of such promising materials. Until now, nickel manganite based spinel thin films have been fabricated by various methods [5] [6] [7] [8] . Kong et al. fabricated Mn-Co-Ni-O (MCN) thin films by RF magnetron sputtering method [5] . Ji et al. also fabricated MCN thin films using laser molecular beam epitaxy technique [6] . However, these vacuum processes have the disadvantage of expensive process costs. Several groups including He et al. fabricated nickel manganite based spinel thin films using chemical solution deposition method, but it requires a relatively high annealing temperature [7, 8] . In previous study, we have also fabricated [(Ni 0.2 Mn 0.8 ) 1-x Cu x ] 3 O 4 (0.25 \u2264 x \u2264 0.40) thin films using the metal-organic decomposition (MOD) method, and demonstrated that the thin films have high absolute TCR values (>3%/K) and low resistivity (<50 \u03a9 cm) [4] . Although the TCR and resistivity outcomes are sufficient, it is not easy to apply them for use in an uncooled microbolometer because the annealing temperature is too high (450\u00b0C annealing temperature (\u2264400\u00b0C) for the direct integration onto a substrate having complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) read-out circuitry [9] .\n\nIt is well known that, in spinel manganite materials, cations are localized at tetrahedral (A) and octahedral (B) sites and the electrical conduction is based on the electron hopping between Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ in B sites [10] . Resistivity is dependent on the cation distribution, i.e., the ratio of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ in B sites, and the ratio can be changed by controlling the amount of Ni 2+ in B sites [11] . Thus, the control of nickel and manganese composition has a great influence on the electrical properties of manganite materials and can lower the annealing temperature while maintaining reasonable level of electrical properties.\n\nIn this work, the microstructures and electrical properties of [(Ni x Mn 1-x ) 0.84 Cu 0.16 ] 3 O 4 thin films prepared by MOD are investigated as a function of the Ni content (0.20 \u2264 x \u2264 0.40). For more stable CMOS compatibility, the process was carried out at a low temperature of 380\u00b0C, and the TCR and resistivity values of the films were characterized.\n\nThe starting materials were MOD coating solutions of NiO (0.5 mol/ L), MnO 1.5 (0.5 mol/L), and CuO (0.4 mol/L) supplied by Kojundo Chemical Laboratory, Japan. The precursor solutions were mixed according to the chemical formula of [(Ni x Mn 1-x ) 0.84 Cu 0.16 ] 3 O 4 and were blended with butyl acetate to enhance the coatability onto substrate. The mixed solution was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 15 min on cleaned SiN x (200 nm)/Si substrates (1 inch \u00d7 1 inch). In order to decompose the precursor materials and prepare an amorphous metal oxide thin film, the deposited film was baked at 200\u00b0C for 30 min. These baked films were further annealed at 380\u00b0C for 5 h in air for crystallization.\n\nThe thickness and surface morphology of the annealed films were characterized using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JSM-6700F, Jeol, Japan) operating at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV and an atomic force microscope (AFM, A100-AFM, APE Research, Italy). The elemental distribution of Ni, Mn and Cu ions at the surface of the annealed films was investigated by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5000 Versa Probe\u2122, ULVAC-PHI, Japan) using monochromatized Al K\u03b1 (1486.6 eV) X-ray source with a power of 25.3 W. The XPS spectra were obtained with the analyzer pass energy of 23.5 eV and the electron take-off angle was set at 45\u00b0. The beam diameter was 100 \u03bcm. The binding energies were calibrated based on the C1s peak at 284.8 eV. The resulting spectra were fitted with the Multipak software. Fitting was performed after Shirley background subtraction and XPS peaks were deconvoluted as Gaussian-Lorentzian components with specified binding energy value for each element. The formation of spinel structure was identified using Fourier-transform infra-red (FT-IR, Nicolet iS50, Thermo, USA) spectroscopy. The resistivity of the thin films was measured by the four-point probe system (VP75, DSF System, Korea) in a temperature range of 25\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C. 3 shows AFM images of film surfaces for different Ni contents (x = =0.2 and 0.4), which clearly demonstrates the drastic difference in surface morphology depending upon the Ni content. These results show that Ni plays an important role in improving the surface morphology by removing the net-like structures. Similar flattening effect of Ni addition has been reported: Mn doped ZnO thin film prepared by solgel spin coating formed a wave like nematic structure, while Ni doped ZnO thin film was flat [12] . Fig. 4 shows the FT-IR spectra of [(Ni x Mn 1-x ) 0.84 Cu 0.16 ] 3 O 4 thin films annealed at 380\u00b0C for 5 h. Three main peaks were detected at 513, 565 and 611 cm -1 [13, 14] , which confirms the formation of a single phase cubic spinel structure in all the samples. 513, 565 and 611 cm \u22121 peaks denote Ni-O bond on B sites, Mn-O bond on B sites and Mn-O(A 1g ) bond on A sites, respectively [14] .\n\nThe XPS was used to study the valences and distributions of the Mn, Cu, and Ni ions in the spinel structure. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the XPS spectra for Mn 2p 3/2 and Cu 2p 3/2 of a [(Ni x Mn 1-x ) 0.84 Cu 0.16 ] 3 O 4 (x = =0.25) thin film samples, respectively. The Mn 2p 3/2 peak was deconvoluted into three peaks of Mn 2+ , Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ at the corresponding binding energies of 641.0 eV, 642.3 eV and 644.0 eV, respectively [5] ; similarly, the Cu 2p 3/2 peak was deconvoluted into two peaks of Cu + and Cu 2+ at binding energies of 930.9 eV and 933.4 eV, respectively [15] . It should be noted that, as the Ni content increases, the ratio of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ in the B sites approaches to unity. The conductivity is known to have maximum when the numbers of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ are identical [18] . In other words, the resistivity tends to decrease when the ratio of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ in the B sites approaches unity, which agrees well with our experimentally measured data shown in Fig. 6 . Fig. 7 shows the resistivity of [(Ni x Mn 1-x ) 0.84 Cu 0.16 ] 3 O 4 thin films annealed at 380\u00b0C for 5 h, as a function of temperature. As the temperature increases, the resistivity decreases, which is a typical characteristics of negative-temperature-coefficient (NTC) thermistor. Further, the resistivity decreases with the increase of Ni content in the films. In order to explain the electrical properties of NTC materials based on nickel-manganite, it is necessary to understand the small polaron hopping model as well as the surface morphology [7] . The electrical conductivity of nickel-manganite-based NTC materials is affected by carrier hopping between Mn 4+ and Mn 3+ ions at the B sites [16, 19] . Therefore, the dependence of the resistivity on the Mn 4+ /Mn 3+ values in Fig. 6 is due to the carrier hopping between Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ . As shown in Table 2 , Ni plays a role in controlling the ratio of Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ in B sites. The small polaron hopping model is expressed by the following equation [20] ,\n\nwhere C is a constant, T is the absolute temperature, \u03b1 and p are power law exponents, and T 0 is the characteristic temperature. When \u03b1 = =p = 1, the electron hopping model becomes the nearest-neighbor hopping (NNH) model, and the spinel manganite film generally follows the NNH model. Therefore, the expression of Eq. (1) can be rewritten as follows:\n\nFrom the plot of ln(\u03c1/T) vs 1/T as shown in Fig. 8 , the linear regression analysis yields T 0 , which is proportional to E a in the NNH model. E a can be calculated from the following equation [8] ,\n\nwhere k B is the Boltzmann constant. The values of calculated T 0 and E a are listed in Table 3 . It was suggested by Elbadraoui et al. that electron conduction may also proceed via jumping between Mn 3+ and Mn 4+ ions on more distant B-sites through Cu + and Cu 2+ ions at the A-sites [10] . This process can be expressed as follows: [16] . Considering the fact that the Cu content does not show any meaningful trend as shown in Table 1 , however, we believe that this mechanism would not have a strong influence on changes in the electrical characteristics. An important factor with regard to the sensitivity of NTC films is the TCR value. The TCR value at 298 K (T) can be evaluated using the following equation [8] : Table 3 shows that the TCR of the annealed films decreased with an increase of Ni content (x) in the film, which shows the same trend to the change in T 0 and E a .\n\nSingle-phase cubic spinel structure [(Ni 0.2 Mn 0.8 ) 1-x Cu x ] 3 O 4 (0.20 \u2264 x \u2264 0.40) thin films were fabricated by metal-organic decomposition. The annealed films (~100 nm thick) showed NTC thermistor characteristics with a decrease in the resistivity upon an increase in the temperature. The morphological uniformity has been improved with the increase of Ni content, while the electrical resistivity was decreased \n\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n\nThe authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: "}
