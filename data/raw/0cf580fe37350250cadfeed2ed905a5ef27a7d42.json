{"title": "Human tRNA Lys3 UUU is Pre-Structured by Natural Modifications for Cognate and Wobble Codon Binding through Keto- EnolTautomerism NIH Public Access Author Manuscript", "body": "Accurate ribosome-mediated protein synthesis requires proper recognition of mRNA codons by specific aminoacylatedtRNAisoacceptors. The influence of post-transcriptional tRNA modifications on translational fidelity has been widely investigated. [1] [2] [3] [4] As a result of such studies, 93 different, naturally-occurring modification chemistries have been identified in tRNAs. 5 These modifications, particularly in the anticodon stem and loop domain (ASL), have been shown to significantly impact ribosome binding affinity, 6-8 codon discrimination, thermodynamic stability, 11 speed of translation, 12 recognition by cognate aminoacyl-tRNAsynthetases 13 and reading frame maintenance. [14] [15] [16] [17] Specifically, modifications to the wobble nucleoside at position-34 and the conserved purine residue at position-37, 3'adjacent to the anticodon, are essential for pre-structuring the ASL, permitting proper anticodon conformation and efficient codon recognition. Human tRNA Lys3 UUU (htRNA Lys3 UUU ; Fig. 1a ,b) is of particular interest because of its dual role in promoting proper endogenous translation and acting as the primer selected for initiation of reverse transcription (RT) by human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and other lentiviruses. 19 Indeed, the ASL modifications present in htRNA Lys3 UUU have been shown to be required for efficient initiation of RT in HIV-1. [20] [21] [22] The anticodon stem and loop (ASL Lys UUU ) domain of the sole E. coli tRNA Lys UUU has been studied extensively as a model due to its modified nucleotides being similar to those of the human tRNA Lys3 UUU and its anticodon loop nucleoside sequence being identical. 23 The ASL loop modifications of the E. colitRNA Lys UUU , 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine (mnm 5 s 2 U 34 ) and N 6 -threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t 6 A 37 ), pre-structure the loop into the canonical U-turn conformation that is necessary for efficient binding to synonymous codons in the ribosomal A-site. Both studies in vitro [27] [28] [29] and in vivo 30 have shown that a 2thiolation, and not 5-methylaminomethylation, at the wobble position acts as a strong positive identity element for recognition of tRNA Lys UUU and tRNA Glu UUC by their respective cognate aminoacyl-tRNAsynthetases. X-ray crystallography of the ASL domain of E. colitRNA Lys on the 30S ribosomal subunit demonstrated clearly that the t 6 A 37 modification further stabilizes the unusually low enthalpy of binding in the A-U rich codonanticodon interaction by forming a cross-strand stack with the first adenosine residue of the codon. 25 The t 6 A 37 modification and its derivatives are found in the tRNAisoacceptors that decode codons beginning with A in all three Domains of life.\n\nhtRNA Lys3 UUU is one of three lysine isoacceptors found in mammalian species and is responsible for decoding the minor lysine codon AAA, as well as the major AAG codon. 32 The ASL domain of htRNA Lys3 UUU is more extensively modified than that of the E. colitRNA Lys UUU . The anticodon loop of hASL Lys3 UUU has a 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2thiouridine at position-34 (mcm 5 s 2 U 34 )and a 2-methylthio-N 6 -threonyl-carbamoyladenosine at position-37 (ms 2 t 6 A 37 ). 35 Apseudouridineis present at position-39 (\u03c8 39 ) in the ASL stem, immediately adjacent to the loop (Fig. 1a,b) . In contrast to the htRNA Lys3 UUU , the ASLs of the isoaccepting htRNA Lys1,2 contain an unmodified C 34 and a more simply modified A 37 (t 6 A 37 ). The htRNA Lys1,2 isoacceptors represent two-thirds of all lysine tRNA in mammalian cells, and are specific for decoding only the dominant AAG codon.In vitro ribosome binding studies using the hASL Lys3 UUU with the E. coli modifications, mnm 5 U 34 and t 6 A 37 , demonstrated that the insertion of the individual modifications in the ASL at positions 34 or 37 respectively, would rescue codon binding to only the cognate AAA.With both modifications present the ASL recognized both AAA and AAG. 8 This highlights the importance of the two-hypermodificationsbeing present for dual codon recognition and specificity.\n\nThe importance of the hypermodified nucleotides mcm 5 s 2 U 34 and ms 2 t 6 A 37 to thestructure and functions of htRNA Lys3 UUU have been modeled and some empirical data reported. 8, 21, [39] [40] [41] However, tangible structural evidence of their functional contributions to the fully modified hASL Lys3 UUU is still lacking. Here, using NMR, X-ray crystallography and otherbiophysical and biochemical methods, we report the key structure/function relationship for these naturally occurring modifications to the anticodon domain of htRNA Lys3 UUU . To the best of our knowledge, the modified nucle otides mcm 5 s 2 U 34 , ms 2 t 6 A 37 and \u03c8 39 were introduced simultaneously into the hASL Lys3 UUU sequence for the first time through chemical synthesis. Codon binding characteristics and atomic resolution structures, both in solution and on the 30S ribosomal subunit, of the doubly modified hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ,ms 2 t 6 A 37 and triply modified hASL Lys3 UUUmcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 show that the modifications are instrumental in the prestructuring of the loop into an open loop conformation and facilitating ketoenoltautomerismthat is essential for cognate and wobble codon binding.\n\nThe triply modified hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 was chemically synthesized in order to determine the effect of the native modifications on its structure and function in binding the cognate and wobble codons AAA and AAG. The site-selected introduction of the complex modifications mcm 5 s 2 U 34 and ms 2 t 6 A 37 is problematic and required a novel chemical synthesis of the oligonucleotide in which the modified nucleoside functional groups as well as the major bases were transiently protected. The protecting chemistries had to be compatible with each other and with that of the major nucleosides such that all are readily and quantitatively removed when the oligonucleotide synthesis was complete. The cyclic chemistry involves the repeated coupling of a nucleoside phosphoramiditeto the growing sequence and, at each addition, the oxidation of the trivalent phosphate into a pentavalent phosphate. Removal of the oligonucleotide from the solid support and deprotection of the C2'-OH are accomplished under conditions that would normally alter the modified nucleosides. A novel use of protecting agents and an alteration of the deprotection protocol maintained the native integrity of the modifications (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The presence of the modifications in stoichiometric amounts was quantified by nucleoside composition analysis with HPLC ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ), and observed in NMR and X-ray crystallography. The terminal base pair \u03c8 27 \u2022A 43 was substituted with a G 27 \u2022C 43 pair to enhance stability of the ASL constructs (Fig. 1a) .\n\nThe triply modified hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 bound AAA and AAG at the A-site of the E. coli ribosome with a high affinity, dissociation constants (K d ) of 3.1 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcM and 3.9 \u00b1 0.8 \u03bcM, respectively (Fig. 2a,b) . In contrast, the unmodified ASL Lys3 UUU exhibited very poor binding to both lysine codons. The equilibrium binding of the unmodified hASL Lys3 UUU to either of the lysine codons AAA or AAG was nearly undetectable (Fig. 2a,b) . Previously, we had observed that the single atom substitution of sulfur for oxygen at the 2-position of U 34 rescued ASL Lys UUU binding of the cognate and wobble codons, and that the introduction of only t 6 A 37 enabled AAA binding, but not AAG binding or translocation to the P-site. 6, 8, 15, 25, 42 Our experiments with the unmodified and modified hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 revealed that anticodon domain modifications enhanced codon binding, similar to results reported for the variously modified anticodon domain of the bacterial tRNA Lys UUU (ASL Lys UUU -s 2 U 34 , ASL Lys UUU -mnm 5 U 34 , ASL Lys UUU -t 6 A 37 and ASL Lys UUU -mnm 5 U 34 ;t 6 A 37 ). 7, 8 Anticodon loop modifications alter thermal stability A comparison of the thermal stabilities of the differently modified hASL Lys3 UUU constructs by UV-monitored thermal denaturation revealed both similarities and distinct differences in their thermodynamic properties. While the enthalpy (\u0394H), entropy (\u0394S) and standard free energy (\u0394G) did not vary significantly, the introduction of modifications caused a reduction in the melt temperature, T m , at which half of the RNA molecules are denatured.The hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 and the hASL Lys3 UUUmcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 exhibited a T m of ~53 \u00b0C in comparison toa T m of ~57 \u00b0C for the unmodified hASL Lys3 UUU (Fig. 2c , and Table 1 ). Even so, the hASL Lys3 UUUmcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 exhibited the greatest degree of hyperchromicityin comparison to the unmodified hASL Lys3 UUU and the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ; (Fig. 2c and Table 1 ). The degree of hyperchromicity is a measure of base stacking and overall molecular order.\n\nModifications may affect the molecular order of the anticodon through base stacking interactions. Relative base stacking interactions are readily observed by comparison of circular dichroism spectra. The circular dichroism(CD) spectra of the ASLs were analyzed at the maximum positive ellipticityof 264 nm. A negative ellipticity at a wavelength of \u03bb = 330 nm and positive ellipticity at \u03bb = 310 nm for both the doubly and triply modified ASLs was also observed (Fig. 2d) . These ellipticities are in agreement with characteristics typical of a 2-thio modified uridine. 43 The hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 exhibited a small but reproducibly greater positive ellipticityat 264 nm than the other two ASLs, suggesting again a higher degree of order.\n\nStructure of the ASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 in solution Sequence-specific NMR resonance assignments-The results of the UV-monitored thermal denaturations and CD spectroscopy implied that the mcm 5 s 2 U 34 , ms 2 t 6 A 37 and \u03c8 39 modifications may play a role in ordering the dynamic structure of the hASL Lys3 UUU . To study and understand the extent to which these modifications affect the anticodon conformation and dynamics, the three dimensional (3D) solution structure of the doubly modified hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 was determined through NMR and restrained molecular dynamics. In addition, the structure of its unmodified counterpart was fully characterized by NMR. In achieving this goal, the identification and sequence-specific assignment of the nucleotide spin systems was completed by using combinations of homo-( 1 H-1 H)-nuclear and natural abundance hetero-( 1 H-13 C; 1 H-31 P)-nuclear 1D and 2D NMR experiments conducted in H 2 O or D 2 O solvent.Well-established protocols were employed for the assignment of nucleic acid resonances in the absence of isotopic labeling. 44, 45 The NMR spectra were recorded in the absence of Mg 2+ because previous experiences revealed that the addition of a physiological amount of Mg 2+ ions (1-5 mM) to the modified ASL samples did not significantly affect the resulting NMR spectra. The addition of larger concentrations of Mg 2+ induced spectral line broadening in some ASLs. 11, 46, 47 Exchangeable protons-The imino and amino protons of the doubly modified hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 were identified and assigned using 1 H 1D and 1 H-1 H 2D NOESY NMR spectra that were recorded in H 2 O at 2 \u00b0C.In assigning the exchangeable protons,we used the initial assumption that the stem of the ASL was reasonably close to Atype RNA conformation, as was indicated by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 2d) . Four resonance signals were observed in the low field region (12.50 -14.00 ppm) of the 1 H 1D spectrum of the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 . These NMR signals were characteristic of imino protons that are engaged in Watson-Crick base pairs and were sequentially assigned to the G 27 H1, G 42 H1, U 41 H3 and G 30 H1 (Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The resonance peak of the G 27 H1 displayed a low intensity and broad line width which is expected from the terminal base pair G 27 \u2022C 43 . The resonance signal corresponding to the H1 imino proton of U 39 that is engaged in the A 31 \u2022U 39 base pair adjacent to the loop could not be identified. Therefore, this imino proton was not assigned. The assignment of the imino protons allowed us to fully assign the amino protons of the nucleotides of the stem. Under our NMR experimental conditions (see Methods and Materials) the rapidly exchanging amino and imino protons of the loop nucleosides could not be identified.\n\nInterestingly, the HN proton of the amide group of the threonyl moiety of ms 2 t 6 A 37 (Fig. 1b ) was clearly identified due to the distinctive chemical shift of its resonance peak observed at 9.66 ppm (Fig. 3 ). Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) cross-peaks were observed between HN and s 2 -CH 3 , between HN and H\u03b2 of the methylene group and between HN and the gamma methyl group, C\u03b3H 3 , of the threonylmoiety (Fig. 3 ). However, a very weak NOE connectivity between HN and Ha was hardly visible at 2 \u00b0C. Additionally, at 2 and 22 \u00b0C, NOE signals between the water molecules and the assigned imino and amino protons were observed, except in the case of HN. Also an NOE was detected between C\u03b3H 3 and s 2 -CH 3 .\n\nNon-exchangeable protons-The H6 and H5 aromatic protons of the nine unmodified pyrimidines of the doubly modified hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 could readily be identified as a result of the presence of intense cross-peaks observed in the COSY and TOCSY spectra (between F 1 = 5.18 -5.90 ppm and F 2 = 7.30 -7.90 ppm). The cross-peaks of the cytidines and uridines were differentiated from each other by using their respective 13 C chemical shifts detected in the 1 H-13 C HSQC spectrum. The H6 proton of the modified uridinemcm 5 s 2 U 34 was identified on the 1 H-13 C HSQC and later assigned on the NOESY spectra. Sequential assignments were obtained within the aromatic to H1' resonance region of the NOESY spectra (F 1 = 5.18 -6.60 ppm and F 2 = 6.90 -8.40 ppm). An NOE walk ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ), that is characteristic of A-form RNA conformation, could be observed through intra/inter-nucleotide NOE cross peaks occurring from G 27 H1'-H8 to G 43 H1'-H6. Disruptions in the NOE walk only occurred in the anticodon loop between mcm 5 s 2 U 34 H1'-H6 and mcm 5 s 2 U 34 H1'-U 35 H6 and between ms 2 t 6 A 37 H1'-H8 and ms 2 t 6 A 37 H1'-A 38 H8.\n\nThe relatively small size of the heptadecamerASL, and the high level of purity of the NMR samples combined with the good resolution and dispersion of the NMR cross-peaks allowed us to achieve a near-complete assignment of the non-exchangeable proton resonances. The H5'/H5\" protons were not entirely identified and assigned as a result of spectral overlap. Despite the disruptions in the NOE walks, NOE connectivities that were important for structure determination were observed between the unmodified and modified nucleotides of the loop region ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ).\n\nModifications may affect the presence of a canonical U-turn in the anticodon loop at the invariant U 33 . Therefore, the solution structure of the doubly modified ASL was investigated for proton and phosphorus resonances that characterize the U-turn. The canonical U-turn conformation in RNAs is confirmed through a distinctive 1 H-NMR \"fingerprint.\" 48 This fingerprint usually consists of NOE signalsbetween the anomeric H1' proton of the conserved U 33 and its own H5/H6, and between the anomeric H1' proton of U 33 and the U 35 H5/H6. In addition, U 33 H2' has NOE connectivities to H5/H6 of bases U 34 and U 35 . Also, the phosphorus of the dinucleotide U 33 33pU 34 has a strong down-field chemical shift which reflects the fact that the a dihedral angle is trans. In our study, an NOE was observed between U 33 H1' and its own aromatic protons for the doubly modified hASL Lys3 UUUmcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 . Another NOE connectivity was detected between U 33 H2' and mcm 5 s 2 U 34 H6. Interestingly, C\u03b3H3 of the methylene group of mcm 5 s 2 U 34 gave a medium strength NOE signal to U 33 H1'. The 1 H-31 P HETCOR NMR experiment showed that the chemical shifts of the resonances for the 31 P nucleus were narrowly confined ( Supplementary Fig. S5 ), as commonly observed in the case of A-RNA. 44, 49 Solution structure of the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 -The distance and angle restraints required for the structure calculation were determined following the NMR spectral analyses. 44 A total of 552 NOE-derived distance restraints were used for the structure calculation. These distance restraints were constituted by 392 and 134 NOE distance restraints that were assigned to the stem and the loop, respectively. In addition, 26 hydrogen bond (hb) and five planarity restraints were also used to define the structure of the stem. A total of 126 dihedral angle restraints were also used to determine the entire structure of the ASL. The results of the UV thermal denaturation, the CD experiments and the pattern of the anomeric-aromatic NOE walk strongly suggested that the stem of the doubly modified ASL adopted an A-RNA conformation. Therefore, the NMR torsion-angle and distance restraints from the stem were complemented with distance restraints that yield the conventional A-form helix RNA conformation, as previously described and employed by others. 47, 48 The ten lowest energy structures determined from the torsion angle molecular dynamics calculations that were in agreement with the NMR data were selected to represent the final ensemble (Fig. 4) . The final set of solution structures was chosen on the basis of displaying not a single NOE restraint violation superior to 0.5 \u00c5 and no dihedral angle violations greater than 5\u00b0. In addition to these selection criteria, structures were rejected if their rootmean square deviations (rmsds) of bonds and angles varied from ideal values, i.e. by greater than 0.02 \u00c5 and 2.0\u00b0, respectively. The pairwise rmsd for all atoms is 0.82 \u00b1 0.20 \u00c5.\n\nAs expected, the stem of the ASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 exhibited typical features characteristic of A-RNA conformation with Watson-Crick base pairs 50 ( Supplementary Fig.  S6 ). The unmodified nucleotides of the stem adopted an anti-parallel geometry with a glycosyl C1'-C1' distance of ~10.6 \u00c5. The sugar moieties adopted the C3'-endo conformation except those of residues U 33 and mcm 5 s 2 U 34 showing C4'-exo and C2'-exo puckers, respectively. The nucleotides of the loop appeared to be stacked. The distance between the horizontal planes of ms 2 t 6 A 37 and U 36 was wider by 2 \u00c5 in comparison to that between ms 2 t 6 A 37 and A 38 . Residues 33-37 of the loop displayed local base step parameters (tilt and roll) that deviated from the standards of A-form helices, but resulted in a stacked anticodon. As a result the labile proton of the acid group of ms 2 t 6 A 37 is in close proximity (2.8 \u00c5) to U 34 and U 35 O4. The distance between A 38 N6 and C 32 O2 proximal to the stem was determined to be 3.5 \u00c5, thereby invoking the potential of hydrogen bonding and the limited extension of the stem ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ).\n\nThe crystal structures of the triply modified hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 bound to the cognate 5'-AAA-3' and wobble 5'-AAG-3' codons were obtained by soaking native Thermusthermophilus 30S ribosomal subunit (30S) crystals with the relevant RNA oligonucleotides. The A-site binding antibiotic paromomycin was included to improve both the resolution of the data and the occupancy of the ASL. This has been shown not to change the structure of the codon-anticodon complex itself. 51 The recognition of the cognate codonanticodon complex in the 30S decoding center is identical to structures reported previously. 51 As already observed for other cognate recognition structures, 25,52 the structure of the 30S itself is identical within experimental error compared to its published structures. This invariance of the 30S allows the differences in ASL structures to be unambiguously attributed to the modifications of the ASL alone.Additionally, the high resolution of the structures, 3.1 \u00c5 and 2.8 \u00c5 for AAA and AAG respectively (Supplementary Table S1 ), allowed for unambiguous determination of the geometry of the ASL and the codonanticodon interaction.\n\nContributions of ms 2 t 6 A 37 and mcm 5 s 2 U 34 to tRNA Lys3 UUU and codons recognition-The N 6 -threonylcarbamoyl (t 6 ) modification of A 37 functions in codon binding, using three different mechanisms as observed previously. 25 First, the t 6 modification abrogates the possible U 33 \u2022A 37 base pair, in effect pre-ordering the hASL Lys3 UUU in a conformation for codon recognition. 53 This open loop conformation of the anticodon seems to be critical for codon binding, at least for the case of the UUU anticodon. 8 Additionally, the ureido group of the t 6 modification forms a pseudo-heterocycle stabilized by a hydrogen bond from N to N1 of the modified adenine base and by the significant charge delocalization within the group. This planar structure is used to increase stacking of the ms 2 t 6 A 37 with A 38 , its 3' neighbor ( Fig. 5a) . Finally, the threonyl moiety is too bulky to be incorporated into the helical stack ( Supplementary Fig. S7 ), so it serves to sterically position the pseudo-three cycle base in a very specific location in order to make a cross-strand stack which bridges from the ASL's 3' stack to the codon itself. This crossstrand stack greatly enhances the stability of the codon-anticodon complex.\n\nThe 2-methylthio (ms 2 ) modification of A 37 functions to enhance the stacking interactions with A1 of the codon, as predicted by a fortuitous crystal packing interaction in the crystal structure of the tRNA alone. 54 The sulfur of the ms 2 modification is positioned to stack proximally to the ring of the codon base A1. It has been shown that placement of a stacking sulfur such that it can interact with an N1 of the stacking partner maximizes the strength of the interaction, 55 and in the current case, it also stacks well with an S 2 -N characteristic, albeit with the N7 rather than the N1 of the codon base A1 (Fig. 5b) . This provides strong evidence that the sulfur of the ms 2 modification acts primarily to enhance the stacking of ms 2 t 6 A 37 with the first base of the codon. The two modifications act in concert to optimize the structure of the anticodon loop in an open conformation prior to codon binding, and to maximize the strength of the codon-anticodon interaction by forming a sulfur-enhanced cross-strand stack by the precisely-positioned pseudo-three cycle base. In the absence of the ms 2 , the t 6 takes the same position in the 3'-stack of the ASL as it does in its presence. This conserved positioning of the t 6 is clearly seen in a superimposition of the crystal of what would be the bacterial ASL Lys UUU -t 6 A 37 and ASL Lys UUU -mnm 5 U 34 ;t 6 A 37 25 with that of the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 (Fig. 5c ).\n\nAlthough this is the first structure of the base mcm 5 s 2 U 34 bound to its cognate and wobble codon bases A and G, respectively, there are studies that have provided important evidence as to how the modifications function. It has been shown that the 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl (mcm 5 ) modification promotes the binding of G-ending codons, but not A-ending codons. In contrast, the 2-thio (s 2 ) modification has been shown to promote binding to both codons, 39 but particularly to A. 7,56 The s 2 , and not the 5-position modification, produces the significantly more stable, anti C3'-endo, g + conformation, and transfers a similar restraint to the 3'-neighbor. 57 In studies of ASLs, it has been demonstrated that mcm 5 U 34 has little measurable effect on structure, but that s 2 U 34 increases the amount of stacking between U 34 and U 35 . 41 This is evident when comparing the anticodon structure of the A-site hASL Lys3 UUU -mnm 5 U 34 ;t 6 A 37 with that of the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ,ms 2 t 6 A 37 \u03c8 39 (Fig. 6) . The mcm 5 s 2 U 34 is more strongly stacked with s 2 on the nucleobase of U 35 than is the mnm 5 U 34 . In fact, s 2 was shown to stack directly on the aromatic ring of U 35 in a crystal structure of the tRNA alone. 54 The s 2 modification is used to maximize stacking interactions with U 35 (Fig. 6) , stacking close to N1 of the ring, the optimal position for maximal stacking interactions. 55 The current crystal structures explain all of these observations and offer an integrated explanation for the functioning of these two modifications.\n\nThe structure of the mcm 5 s 2 U 34 \u2022A 3 base pair is in the conventional Watson-Crick geometry, as expected (Fig. 7a) . The mcm 5 modification does not appear to play a significant role in decoding AAA. However, the s 2 modification is unambiguously participating in a stacking interaction with U 35 , as anticipated from the tRNA crystal structure. This rationalizes the results for binding to A in previous studies, 6, 7, 38, 56, 58 where a position 34 modification was shown to display a higher binding affinity to A but not G; whereas, s 2 enhanced the binding affinity to both A and G.\n\nThe structure of the mcm 5 s 2 U 34 \u2022G3 base pair is again in the Watson-Crick geometry, but this is more unusual because to pair with G3 through hydrogen bonding in this geometry, mcm 5 s 2 U 34 must shift from its keto to an enol form (Fig. 7b) . The keto to enoltautomerism has been observed in the case of uridine 5-oxyacetic acid, cmo 5 U, in tRNA Val , binding to G. 52 Therefore, it is not surprising for this base pair configuration to occur for mcm 5 s 2 U. However, atautomerismof mnm 5 U 34 has not been observed in its binding of G3. 25 The geometries of the mcm 5 s 2 U 34 and mnm 5 U 34 base paring to G3 are significantly different with the size of the s 2 -group a contributing factor to the positioning of the thiolated base (Fig. 7c) . Whereas the thiol positions the mcm 5 s 2 U 34 , the main function of the mcm 5 modification is to modify the electronic structure of the ring. This shift of the keto-enol equilibrium far enough towards enol enables hydrogen bonding of the mcm 5 s 2 U 34 \u2022G3 base pair.\n\nThe pre-structured and constrained tRNA anticodon is energetically advantageous for a cell's protein synthesis. Every anticodon (other than that of initiator tRNA) must conform to the constraints of the ribosome's A-site, and yet present a physicochemical face that repeatedly reads only the appropriate codons. Repeated use of a conformed and dynamically restricted anticodon negates the need for remodeling the RNA each time an aminoacyl-tRNA is used for the decoding of its synonymous codons. Thus, pre-structuring of the anticodon enhances the accuracy and efficiency of protein synthesis. Though this is true of a great many tRNAs, the tRNA Lys UUU species is of particular interest for two reasons. First, approximately half of all bacteria have one lysine tRNAisoacceptor, the tRNA Lys UUU that has a 5methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine modification at wobble position 34 and a N 6threonylcarbamoyladenosine, which allows it to respond to both lysine codons AAA and AAG. 23 In contrast, mammalian cells contain three lysine isoacceptingtRNA species for cytoplasmic protein synthesis. The mammalian tRNA Lys1 CUU and tRNA Lys2 CUU constitute the majority of lysine tRNAs in the cell and respond only to AAG, the prominent lysine codon. The tRNA Lys3 UUU is the least abundant of the three isoacceptors in the cell and responds to AAA and AAG. Second, the host cell tRNA Lys3 UUU is selected by HIV as the primer for the initiation of reverse transcription as predicted from the viral RNA sequence. [59] [60] [61] The individual modificationsof mnm 5 U 34 at the wobble position and t 6 A at position-37 enhanced the cognate codon binding of the unmodified ASL Lys3 UUU by approximately seven-fold; however, the modifications in combination increased codon binding to a level equivalent to that of endogenous E. colitRNA Lys UUU . 8 The combination of t 6 A 37 and mnm 5 U 34 or s 2 U 34 also allowed efficient wobble codon recognition, but the s 2 -modification was required for proper translocation to the P-site. 6, 8, 25, 56 The 2-thiolated uridine at the wobble position of many tRNAs, as well as that of htRNA Lys3 UUU , causes a slight enhancement of ribosome binding to A over G at the third position of the codon. 6, 38, 58 Molecular dynamics simulations of the xm 5 s 2 U mononucleoside bound to A or G also showed a marked preference for binding to A. 62 Previous NMR experiments investigating xm 5 s 2 U as a mononucleoside and in short polymers showed a strong steric preference for the modified uridine to adopt an anti, C3'-endo sugar pucker conformation, effecting the same in 3'-neighboring nucleosides. Thus, the thio-moiety causes a more rigid binding geometry that could account for selection against pyrimidines at the third position of the codon. 57, 58, 63, 64 Molecular dynamics simulations also confirmed that the ms 2 t 6 A 37 reduced thermal stability via a stereochemical effect that widened the loop and prevented the A 37 \u2022U 33 cross-loop interaction. 40 In contrast, structural models of the unmodified ASLs of tRNA Lys UUU and those singly modified with \u03c8 39 that had been generated using a subset of NMR distance restraints indicated a thermally stable, closed UUU triloop structure. 41 Consistent with previous in silico models and empirical studies, the addition of ms 2 t 6 A 37 to models of the singly modified ASL Lys UUU -\u03c8 39 also enhanced the stacking interaction of A 37 with U 36 and created a more defined positioning of U 36 . 41 According to the models, neither the mcm 5nor s 2 -moieties of U 34 were sufficient to promote a canonical U-turn conformation. However, the singly modified ASL with mcm 5 s 2 U 34 showed many U-turn NMR indicators. 41 These models suggested a role for the ms 2 t 6 A 37 in negating intraloop interactions, ordering of the anticodon loop conformation and stabilizing the weak U 36 \u2022A1 pair while mcm 5 s 2 U 34 enhanced anticodon base stacking and promoted the canonical U-turn conformation.\n\nEmpirical and in silico structural studies conclude that these modifications enhance codon recognition by acting to remodel the highly constrained and unfavorable conformation of the unmodified ASL toward a more canonical shape. 6, 26, 41, 53, 65, 66 Although these studies have shown that the modifications push the equilibrium toward a U-turn structure, it has been unclear as to whether the solution conformation of the fully modified ASL would be sufficiently pre-structured to explain the high level of endogenous codon specificity and fidelity. Here we conclusively show that the fully modified solution structure conforms to a structure that shows only minor differences from the stably bound crystal structure in the ribosomal A-site. In fact, our data also supports the notion that the pre-structuring has underlying thermodynamic causes and allows for a novel keto-enol mechanism of exclusively recognizing purines at the third codon position.\n\nThe thermodynamic causes of modification-induced pre-structuring are evident in the thermal melting and circular dichroism spectra. The negative 330 nm and positive 330 nm signals observed in the CD spectrum of the modified ASLs were due to the presence of the 2-thio modification of uridine as previously observed, 43 confirming the presence of this modification in the doubly and triply modified ASLs. The slightly higher value of the positive ellipticityat 264 nm found in the case of the hASL Lys3 UUUmcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 indicated that the bases were involved in stacking interactions that exceeded those of both the unmodified hASL Lys3 UUU and the doubly modified hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 (Fig. 3d) . These results are not surprising as the introduction of mcm 5 s 2 U 34 and ms 2 t 6 A 37 negated intra-loop hydrogen bonding, reducing the melting temperature and enthalpy of base stacking.Indeed it has been shown that modifications most likely affect codon bias by contributing significantly to the thermodynamic stability and structural characteristics of htRNA Lys3 UUU . Modifications of the Watson-Crick face of the invariant purine 37 decrease the thermal stability of the ASL by negating intra-loop hydrogen bonds and by widening the loop, as was initially found for the m 1 G 37 of yeast tRNA Phe . 11, 65, 67 The modification of A 37 to t 6 A 37 and to ms 2 t 6 A 37 in an otherwise unmodified anticodon stem and loop domain of htRNA Lys3 UUU resulted in decreases in thermal stability of 2-3 and 5 \u00b0C, respectively. 53, 68 {Bajji, 2002 #465}However, by negating the intra-loop hydrogen bonding, the base stacking at the base of the stem is alleviated, which resulted in only minor differences in ellipticity between the constructs. \u03c8 39 is known to stabilize tRNA's anticodon domain, 66,69 but does not appear to effect codon binding. 69 The presence of pseudouridine at position-39 enhanced the interaction with A 31 that constitutes the closing base pair of the stem 40,41,66 and stabilized the canonical U-turn conformation, 41 thereby raising the thermal stability of the ASL and increasing the base stacking of the anticodon residues.\n\nThe variations in 1 H NMR chemical shifts observed when comparing the unmodified and the modified ASLs (Supplementary Table S2 ) suggested that the spatial electronic environments of the aromatic atoms of mcm 5 s 2 U 34 , U 36 , A 38 and U 39 were affected by the introduction of the modified residues within the ASL. The invariant chemical shifts were mostly seen for the residues of the stem attesting that the presence of mcm 5 s 2 U 34 and ms 2 t 6 A 37 in the loop did not structurally influence the helical A-RNA conformation of the stem. The greater distance observed between ms 2 t 6 A 37 and U 36 could have been induced by the large atomic radius of the sulfur group trying to accommodate itself between the above residues. The short distances found between the labile proton of the acid group of ms 2 t 6 A 37 and mcm 5 s 2 U 34 /U 35 O4 and between A 36 N6 and C 32 O2 invoked the potential hydrogen bonding that restrained the threonyl group of ms 2 t 6 A 37 to be positioned across the loop region. As a result the loop extension was limited. The NOE observed between C 10 H 3 and s 2 -CH 3 indicated the close spatial proximity (4 -5 \u00c5) of these two groups. As a result, a clear orientation of these methyl groups was obtained during the solution structure determination of the doubly modified ASL Lys3 UUU . The lack of a complete set of the signature NMR resonances for a U-turn indicated that the loop of the modified hASL Lys3 UUU did not have a canonical U-turn, but nonetheless exhibited a backbone turn at U 33 in the NMR-restrained molecular dynamics derived structure.\n\nHere, we have shown that the extensive post-transcriptional modifications of the htRNA Lys3 UUU pre-structure the anticodon domain for codon binding, and alter the chemistry of the wobble position uridine to engage in a Watson-Crick base pair with the G3 of the AAG codon. Previously, we had determined and compared the codon binding properties, NMR-derived solution structures and crystallographic structures of codon binding of the ASL Lys UUU with and without the bacterial modifications, mnm 5 -and t 6 A 37 . 8,53 Now, we can compare the structures of the hASL Lys3 -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 presented here with a previous structure in solution, 53 and to that of the crystal structure of the entire htRNA Lys3 UUU . 54\n\nA structural comparison of the solution structure of hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 to that of the singly modified hASL Lys UUU -t 6 A 37 53 reveals a significant, modification dependent rearrangement of the loop region (Fig. 8a) .However, the nearly superimposable nature of the stems renders the overall rmsd quite low (Supplementary Table S3b ).At the base of the stem, the possibility for the classically bifurcated cross-loop hydrogen bond is slightly perturbed from that of the singly modified structure (Fig. 8b) . In the doubly modified hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 , the distance between the bases are increased from 3.0 \u00c5 in the singly modified structure to 3.4 \u00c5. The stacking interaction between ms 2 t 6 A 37 and A 38 in hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 is in a more favorable geometry, presumably stabilizing A 38 into a less favorable cross-loop interaction, resulting in a more open and more canonical loop structure (Fig. 8b) .\n\nAlthough the anticodon of doubly modified hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 in solution did not contain a canonical U-turn conformation, the hypermodified nucleosides shift the structure into a structure that is more indicative of a U-turn than the singly modified hASL Lys3 UUU -t 6 A 37 . 53 The two solution structures differ dramatically in the anticodon (Fig.  8a) . While the anticodon nucleosides in the singly modified construct are mostly unstacked, in hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 the anticodon bases are clearly ordered into a well stacked conformation and exposed to the solvent for proper codon recognition. The anticodon stacking, abrupt backbone turn at U 33 and the nicely ordered and stacked residues along the 3' side of the loop indicate that the doubly modified ASL has structural characteristics suggestive of a canonical conformation that would be significantly more favorable to ribosomal A-site binding.\n\nA comparison of the crystal structures of the full length, fully modified tRNA Lys3 UUU 54 to the co-crystal structures bound to synonymous codons in the ribosomal A-site reveals minor differences. This comparison strongly supports the hypothesis that modifications prestructure tRNA`s anticodon domain for codon binding. 1 The crystal structures reported here, bound to AAA/G, are nearly superimposable, with a heavy atom rmsd of 0.45 \u00c5 (Supplementary Fig. S8 ,and Table S3a ). The most notable difference between these two structures and the anticodon domain of the full length, fully modified tRNA Lys3 UUU occurs at the base of the stem. In the crystal structure of tRNA Lys3 UUU , A 31 forms a planar, stable base pair with U 39 , 54 but in the co-crystal structures on the ribosome, the A 38 residue is rotated out of plane indicating a less stable base pair and possibly contributing to the opening of the loop. Interestingly, in the solution structure we observe that the ms 2 t 6 A 37 causes a slight perturbation of the C 32 \u2022A 38 mismatch base pair by enhancing the stacking interaction of A 38 with A 37 and causing a displacement of ~0.4 \u00c5. These data suggest that both \u03c8 39 andms t 6 A 37 cooperatively extend the distance between C 32 and A 38 to abrogate the mismatch pair, forcing the loop into the open conformation necessary for a stable U-turn. Indeed, the distance and geometry between C 32 and A 38 in all three crystal structures would not be amenable to a stable cross-loop interaction.\n\nAs expected from the Watson-Crick geometry of the U 34 \u2022G 3 wobble base pair, the crystal structures of the ASL bound to AAA and AAG codons were nearly identical ( Supplementary Fig. S8 ). However, a superimposition of the NMR-derived solution structure of the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 with that of the crystal structure of the ASL region of the entire tRNA 54 and the co-crystal structure of hASL Lys3 UUUmcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 bound to the AAG codon indicates some salient differences (Fig.  9a, Supplementary Table S3c ). The crystal structures show a very well defined U-turn conformation in which there is an abrupt change in direction at U 33 .The anticodon bases are ideally stacked with their Watson-Crick faces solvent exposed and the bases on the 3' side of the loop form a very canonical stacking pattern (Supplementary Fig. S8 ). In contrast, in the solution structure, the common features of the U-turn are not evident and the structure is clearly dynamic (Fig. 9a) . This feature is also evident in the thermal denaturation, where the doubly modified construct has a much lower hyperchromicity and enthalpy change than the triply modified hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 (Table 1) . These are both measures of the relative order of a molecule and indicate that these structural differences are empirical and not artifacts.\n\nA lack of significant differences between the ASL of the full length tRNAcrystal structure and the co-crystals of the ASLs bound to the ribosome reveal that the functional binding results associated with using the truncated anticodon domain are a reasonable measure of the decoding capacity of the full length tRNA. It should also be noted that although an NMRderived solution structure of the fully modified ASL was not obtained, it can be assumed that the addition of the \u03c8 at position 39 would further drive the formation of a canonical Uturn in solution. 66, 69 An induced fit model of decoding, in which the ASL would conform to a U-turn upon entering the ribosomal A-site is not consistent with the data due to the clear evidence from the crystal structure of the full length tRNA of a pre-structured, U-turn containing anticodon domain prior to entering the A-site. 54 Curiously, the high degree of structural conservation (rmsd = 0.65 \u2212 0.77 \u00c5, Supplementary Table S3a-c) between the crystal and the solution structures of the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 bound in the A-site suggests that in comparison, the anticodon domains of the partially modified E. coli ASLs incurred a degree of conformational change during codon recognition. 25 The AAG codon binding of the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 exhibits an mcm 5 s 2 U 34 \u2022G3 pairing that is a Watson-Crick pair with three hydrogen bonds, one of which involves the s 2 -modication. The hydrogen bond between the iminonitrogens of mcm 5 s 2 U 34 and G3 of the codon requires a keto-enoltautomerism similar to the mechanism by which cmo 5 U 34 enables ASL Val3 to respond to all four codons in its degenerate box. 52 While the current mcm 5 s 2 U 34 \u2022G3 base pair structure agrees well with that of cmo 5 U 34 \u2022G3. 52 it stands in stark contrast to the structure of mnm 5 U 34 \u2022G3, 25 in which the modified U makes a threecentered hydrogen bond to G3 and partially stacks on U 35 (Fig. 7c) . The equilibrium shift from the keto to enol tautomer inherent to these two modified nucleosides may suggest either a role of the cmo 5 or the s 2 and mcm 5 modifications in altering the electronic structure of the aromatic base or a local pH change in the environment in the immediate vicinity of the wobble base pair. It is critical to note that the mnm 5 U 34 is missing the naturallyoccurring 2-thio modification, so its stacking potential and electronic structure is not that which occurs in nature. The difference in binding modes could be due to the fact that the previous work is a different modification that does not affect the keto-enol equilibrium and thus does not allow a Watson-Crick base pair as for cmo 5 U 34 and mcm 5 s 2 U 34 and that the observed structure is what will occur for the fully-modified ASL. The partially modified ASL Lys UUU -mnm 5 U 34 binds the cognate AAA, but not the wobble codon AAG, while the unmodified E. coliASL Lys UUU binds neither codon. 8 We find it more likely that the previous, partially modified structure behaves differently from the fully modified mnm 5 s 2 U 34 \u2022G3, and that the fully modified structure would be very similar to the current structure. The thio modifications have been shown to be used to stack with adjacent rings for modifications at position-34 and 37, and were mnm 5 U 34 to be fully thiolated, stacking on U 35 would require moving into Watson-Crick geometry. This is an excellent illustration of how finely tuned codon-anticodon interactions are, with the lack of one sulfur atom and presence of an oxygen disrupting the true structure of the codon-anticodon complex. 6 Differences in modification between the bacterial and eukaryotic tRNA Lys perhaps indicatethe co-evolution of anticodon modifications with codon bias and the use of less common tRNAisoacceptorsfor control of gene expression. Half of all bacteria have but the one tRNA Lys with the UUU anticodon that reads the predominant codon AAA. The same tRNAreads the rarer codon AAG. In contrast, the additional isoacceptors tRNA Lys1&2 in mammalian cells have the anticodon CUU and respond only to AAG, the preferred lysine codon by a factor of two. The amount of tRNA Lys3 is only a third of the total amount of tRNA Lys required for protein synthesis in mammalian cells. This leads one to the concept of codon bias being linked to tRNAisoacceptor abundance in the cell. 15 tRNA abundance, in turn is also correlated to environmental responses. 15 By pre-structuring the nucleoside geometry and backbone conformation, the tRNA Lys3 modifications certainly alter the presentation of anticodon nucleosides for codon recognition. tRNA Lys1,2 do not require t 6 A 37 for binding of the AAG codon, 8 but the anticodon modification t 6 A 37 that is common to all isoacceptors appears to be a recognition determinant for the lysyl-tRNAsynthetases. The difference in modifications between tRNA Lys3 and tRNA Lys1,2 implicate tRNA Lys3 modifications in regulatinggene expression inmammalian cells through codon usage. Since lysine codons share a mixed codon box with the two asparagine codons, the major difference between isoacceptorsis located at the wobble position. Thus, the chemistries, structures and physical volumes of post-transcriptional modifications alter tRNA's anticodon conformation and restrict its dynamics for protein synthesis as had been proposed twenty years previously in a modified wobble hypothesis. 1\n\nIn the solid-phase syntheses of the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 with and without \u03c8 39 , the 5\u2032-O-dimethoxytrityl-and 2\u2032-O-t-butyldimethylsilyl-protecting groups were used for both modified and unmodified phosphoramidite monomers. The exocyclic amines of A, G and C were protected with the 4-tert-butylphenoxyacetyl (tac) group. The mcm 5 s 2 U phosphoramidite had no additional protecting groups. The ms 2 t 6 A phosphoramidite had the carboxyl group of the threonyl residue protected as a 4-nitrophenylethyl ester and the secondary hydroxyl group of the threonyl residue was protected as a tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) ether.\n\nSynthesis was performed on rC(tac) CPG (27 \u03bcmole and 31 \u03bcmole scale for non-\u03c8 39 and \u03c8 39 variants) and coupling was performed with 0.1 M monomer solutions and 0.3 M BTT in acetonitrile for 6 minutes (min) with U and C monomers, 7 min for A and G monomers, and for 10 min with the mcm 5 s 2 U and ms 2 t 6 A monomers. For standard RNA monomers 5 molar equivalents were used per coupling, but for the modified monomers only 3 equivalents were used. The capping step was performed for 2 min with tac anhydride. To prevent desulfurization, the oxidations were performed with 1 M cumenehydroperoxide in toluene for 3 min.\n\nAfter assembly, the 5'-O-trityl group was left on. The dried support was treated with 10% DBU in THF under argon at 40\u00b0C to remove the cyanoethyl and 4-nitrophenylethyl protecting groups. The CPG was then washed twice with dry THF and treated with 10% DBU in methanol under argon for 18 hours at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and stored under argon. After washing with dry methanol, the washings and supernatant were combined and dried in a Speedvac. The residue was further dried under high vacuum (0.01-0.001 Torr) over separate containers of phosphorus pentoxide and potassium hydroxide pellets for 48 hours to remove residual DBU. The residue was then dissolved in triethyleneaminetri(hydrofluoride) under argon to cleave the TBDMS protecting groups and the DMTr from the 5'-terminal G. After quenching with water, the RNA was precipitated with 1-butanol and dried under vacuum. Purification was by preparative anionexchange HPLC on a Source 15Q 10/10 column using a gradient of sodium chloride in a phosphate buffer containing 50 \u03bcM EDTA and 8 M urea. Desalting was performed on a Sephadex G25 column. Nucleoside composition analysis was conducted by HPLC with onthe-fly UV diode array spectroscopy. 70 The ASLs were further purified by extensive dialysis (using Slide-A-Lyzer MINI Dialysis Units, 3.5K MWCO from Pierce) against 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 50 mM Na + , and 50 mM K + . The oligonucleotides were heated to 80 \u00b0C followed by slow cooling to form a solution homogeneous in ASL conformation. After cooling, the samples were lyophilized using a freeze-dryer (Thermo Savant SPD Speed Vac, Thermo Scientific) and then dissolved in 99.996% 2 H 2 O or a 90% 1 H 2 O+10% 2 H 2 O mixture to give a final volume of 300 \u03bcL. Samples in 2 H 2 O were re-dissolved in 2 H 2 O at least twice more and lyophilized. NMR samples of the ASLs were generally at concentrations of 1.5 mM.\n\nThe ribosomal binding assays consisted of reaction mixtures of purified E. coli (MRE 600) 70S ribosomes 42 and chemically synthesized mRNAs and ASLs. The 27-nt mRNA oligonucleotide sequences were derived from T4 gp32 mRNA 71 and were purchased from Dharmacon (ThermoFisher, Lafayette, CO). In order to study binding at the ribosomal Asite, the P-site needed to be blocked. Therefore, the mRNA was designed with the Methionine (Met) codon AUG at the P-site. The E. colitRNA fMet was then used to saturate the P-site. Possible secondary structure folding of each mRNA sequence was assessed with the program RNA Structure 4.2 72 and resulted in a low probability of any secondary structure that may obstruct binding of the mRNA to the ribosome. The mRNA sequences are as follows (Lys codons AAA and AAG are in bold and underlined):\n\n5'-GGCAAGGAGGUAAAAAUGAAAGCACGU-3';\n\n5'-GGCAAGGAGGUAAAAAUGAAGGCACGU-3'.\n\nThe 70S ribosomal subunits were isolated as previously described. 42 The ASLs were 5'end 32 P-labeled using [\u03b3-32 P] ATP (MP Biomedicals). Unlabeled ASLs in a range of concentrations (0-2.5\u03bcM) were mixed with insignificant, but radiochemically detectable amounts (2,000-5,000 CPM) of 5'-end, 32 P-labeled ASLs in a fixed ratio of unlabeled ASL to labeled ASL. The assay was performed in ribosomal binding buffer [50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0; 30 mMKCl; 70 mM NH4Cl; 1 mM DTT; 100 \u03bcM EDTA; 20 mM MgCl 2 ). Ribosomes (0.25\u03bcM) were activated by heating to 42\u00b0C, incubating for 10 min and then slowly cooled to 37\u00b0C. The ribosomes were programmed with 2.5 \u03bcM mRNA for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. The Psite was saturated with 1.25 \u03bcME. colitRNA fMet (Sigma-Aldrich), which binds to AUG, for 15 min at 37\u00b0C; see underlined codons of the mRNA sequences above. Binding of ASL Lys3 UUU to the A-site was allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. The reaction mixtures (20\u03bcL each) were then placed on ice for 20 min, diluted with 100 \u03bcL buffer per reaction mixture, and filtered through nitrocellulose in a modified Whatman Schleicher and Schuell (Brentford, U.K.) 96-well filtration apparatus. 73 Prior to filtration of experimental samples, the nitrocellulose filter was equilibrated in binding buffer at 4\u00b0C for at least 20 min and each well of the filtration apparatus was washed with 100 \u03bcL of cold binding buffer. After filtration of reaction samples, each well was then washed twice with 100 \u03bcL of cold binding buffer. The nitrocellulose was blotted dry with Kimwipes (Kimberly-Clark), and the radioactivity was measured using a phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics, GE Healthcare). Data were measured for radioactive intensity using ImageQuant (Amersham). Nonspecific binding was determined by the binding of ASLs to ribosomes without mRNA and subtracted from the experimental data. The final data is a result of at least two separate experiments, each done with samples in triplicate, i.e. at least six results for each binding point.\n\nThe thermal stabilities of the ASLs were monitored using a Varian Cary 3 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Agilent) controlled with WinUV version 3.00 software. All samples were first adjusted to an absorbance of ~0.2 OD units at 260 nm in 20 mMsodium/potassium phosphate buffer (10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 and 10 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 6.8). Absorbance at 260nm was measured over the temperature range of 5\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C. The temperature was ramped at 1\u00b0C/min and data was collected at a rate of 1 data point per minute, averaged over 2 seconds. Thermodynamic parameters and melting temperatures were calculated from the melt profiles using MeltWin v3.5. All data were baseline corrected using a control containing buffer only.\n\nCircular dichroism spectra were collected on a Jasco J600 spectropolarimeter. All samples were adjusted to ~0.2 OD at 260nm in 20mM sodium/potassium phosphate buffer (10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 and 10 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 6.8) prior to CD analysis and analyzed in a 1 cm path length quartz cuvette. Samples were temperature controlled to 25\u00b0C during data collection. All data were baseline corrected using a control containing buffer only.\n\nBruker DRX500 and Varian Inova-600 instruments were used to conduct the experiments. NMR data were processed with either XWINNMR (Bruker Inc., Rheinstetten, Germany) or NMRPipe, 74 and the analysis was conducted with SPARKY. 75 hase-shifted sine bell apodization functions and third-degree polynomial baseline correction in both dimensions. To improve the digital resolution for the cross-peak integration, the FIDs were zerofilled to 2048 \u00d7 2048 points.\n\nStructure calculations were performed using CNS and were based on published protocols. 47, 78, 79 The backbone and the ribose torsion angles were restrained to be within \u00b115\u00b0 of the standard A-form values. NOESY mixing time studies also provided distance restraints between nonexchangeable protons in the loop region. The NOE cross-peaks were integrated by using the peak fitting Gaussian function and volume integration in SPARKY. The distances were determined and normalized to the non-overlapped pyrimidine H5-H6 cross-peaks with a distance of 2.44 \u00c5. Upper and lower bonds were assigned to \u00b1 20% of the calculated distances. The distances involving the unresolved protons, i.e., methyls of ms 2 t 6 A 37 and mcm 5 s 2 U 34 as well as its methylene group, were subjected to the pseudoatom correction automatically computed by CNS. Residues with non-observable H1\u2032-H2\u2032 crosspeaks on the DQF-COSY spectra or with 3 J H1\u2032-H2\u2032 values of <3 Hz were restrained to the C3\u2032-endo conformation, whereas in those with 3 JH1\u2032-H2\u2032 values appearing to be between 4 and 5 Hz, the ribose was left unconstrained. The \u03b1 and \u03b6 torsion angles were restrained to exclude the trans conformation. The \u03b2, \u03b5, and \u03b3angles were restrained on the basis of the 1 H-31 P HETCOR spectra as previously described. 44, 49 The structures were analyzed using 3DNA. 80\n\nPurification, crystallization and cryoprotection of Thermusthermophilus 30S ribosomal subunits was conducted exactly as has been described. 81 The mRNA oligonucleotides were chemically synthesized (Dharmacon,ThermoFisher, Lafayette, CO) with the sequences 5'-AA(A/G)AAA-3' (codons underlined). After cryoprotection, the empty crystals were soaked in cryoprotection solution augmented with 80 \u03bcM paromomycin, 300 \u03bcM ASL and 300 \u03bcM mRNA oligonucleotide for at least 48 hours. Crystals were flash-cooled by plunging into liquid nitrogen and stored for data collection.\n\nCrystals were pre-screened at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France) beamline ID14-2 and data was collect at ESRF beamline ID14-4. Processing was performed using XDS, 82 CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4:1994) was used for format manipulation, COOT 83 Two dimensional homonuclear ( 1 H-1 H) NOESYNMR spectrum of hASL Lys3 UUUmcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 .

The pairwise rmsd for all atoms is 0.82 \u00b1 0.20 \u00c5 from the average structure. The locations of the modified residues are indicated by red circles for clarity. Crystallographic structures of hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 decoding cognate and wobble codons, AAA and AAG, respectively. (a)The ms 2 t 6 A 37 stacks strongly with A 38 , making use of the N 6 -threonylcarbamoyl moiety to increase area of interaction. (b) The ms 2 t 6 A 37 does not stack with U 36 (both with carbons colored slate), but instead forms a cross-strand stack involving its 2-methylthio modification with A1 of the codon (carbons colored cyan), which is hydrogen bonded to U 36 (black dotted lines). (c) The positioning of the t 6 and ms 2 -groups within the structures of the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 (carbons colored slate) and the ASL Lys3 UUU -t 6 A 37 (carbons colored grey). The ribosomal crystal structures bound to the AAA codon are superimposed using the backbones as a register. The modified A 37 residues including the t 6 -moieties (carbons colored pink) superimpose with the ms 2 -moiety clearly directed away from the ASL. The anticodon structure of hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 in the ribosomal A-site compared to that of the ASL Lys3 UUU -mnm 5 U 34 ;t 6 A 37 . The crystallographic structures of the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 (blue) and that of the ASL Lys3 UUUmnm 5 U 34 ;t 6 A 37 (grey)in the ribosomal A-site are superimposed to reveal differences in the anticodon conformations. The s 2 -moiety of mcm 5 s 2 U 34 stacks on the nucleobase of U 35 . The positioning of the methyl groups of the mcm 5 and mnm 5 do not correspond due to the weak electron density at the extremities of the side chains. Cognate and wobble codon recognition by hASL Lys3 UUU employs keto-enoltautomerism. (a) hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 bound to AAA in the ribosomal A-site. The mcm 5 s 2 U 34 (carbonsslate) base pairs with A 3 of the codon in the canonical Watson-Crick geometry. (b)The hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 (carbons blue) recognition of the wobble codon AAG. When paired with G3 (cyan), the Watson-Crick geometry of a C\u2022G base pair is maintained for this mcm 5 s 2 U 34 \u2022G3 pair. This requiresthe tautomericenol form of mcm 5 s 2 U 34 . The electron density of the 2f o -f c maps, shown at 1.5\u03c3, clearly indicates the positioning of the modifications.(c) Comparison of the hASL Lys3 UUUmcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 ;\u03c8 39 and ASL Lys UUU -mnm 5 U 34 ; 6 A 37 recognitions of the wobble codon AAG. The mnm 5 U 34 (carbons grey) in the mnm 5 U 34 \u2022G3 base pair 25 is superimposed on the mcm 5 s 2 U 34 (carbons blue) of the mcm 5 s 2 U 34 \u2022G3 (cyan) using the G3 as a reference. The mcm 5 -moiety alters the electronic structure of the ring producing a shift toward the enol tautomer. The positioning of the mcm 5 s 2 U 34 can be attributed to the stereochemical restrictions imposed by the larger sulfur atom at position 2 of the uridine as compared to that of the oxygen. For lack of sufficient electron density to accurately place the extremes of the 5-position moieties, the differing geometries of the methoxy-of mcm 5 s 2 U 34 and the aminomethyl of mnm 5 U 34 are not considered significant. Comparison of the NMR-derived solution structures.(a)A comparison of the NMR structure of the singly modified hASL Lys3 UUU -t 6 A 37 (orange) 53 to that of the doubly modified hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ;ms 2 t 6 A 37 (green) shows the high degree of deviation in the backbone in the anticodon loop. (b) A zoomed view of the potential bifurcated hydrogen bonding between C 32 and A 38 indicates that the prospective of stacking with the heterotricyclic ring system of A 37 competes with the cross-loop interaction, widening the distance between these nucleosides. Comparison of the crystal structure bound to the A-site AAG codon to the NMR-derived solution structure of the hASL Lys3 UUU -mcm 5 s 2 U 34 ,ms 2 t 6 A 37 . (a) The NMR-derived solution structure (green) has an rmsd from the AAA bound crystal structure of 1.91 \u00c5 (not shown) and the AAG bound crystal structure of 1.81 \u00c5 (blue). (b) The C 32 \u2022A 38 cross-loop interaction shows the difference between the NMR and crystal structures that is induced by the weakened base pairing between the stem residues A 31 and \u03c8 39 .
