{"title": "Architects of Assembly: roles of Flaviviridae nonstructural proteins in virion morphogenesis", "body": "The Flaviviridae family is a group of small, enveloped RNA viruses, consisting of the genera Hepacivirus, Flavivirus, and Pestivirus, and including numerous significant pathogens. Approximately 120 million people worldwide are currently infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), the prototype member of the Hepacivirus genus. These individuals are at risk of developing cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and extrahepatic disease. The genus Flavivirus includes vector-borne disease agents such as yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus (DEN), and West Nile virus (WNV). Many of these pathogens are resurging and spreading to new environments and are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. Pestiviruses, including bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and classical swine fever virus (CSFV), are pathogens of animals and are of significant financial concern to the livestock industry (reviewed in 1 ).\n\nThe Flaviviridae genome is a single-stranded RNA molecule, which, upon introduction to the cell, is recognized as a messenger RNA and translated by the host cell machinery to yield a polyprotein (Fig 1) . Processing by viral and cellular enzymes releases the individual viral gene products (Fig 2) . Structural proteins, which comprise the virion, consist of core (capsid in flaviviruses, C) and the envelope glycoproteins. Most of the nonstructural proteins associate to form the replicase complex, which catalyzes RNA accumulation in close association with modified cytoplasmic membranes 2,3,4 . NS3 and its cofactor NS4A, or NS2B (flaviviruses), is the main viral protease; NS3 also has helicase and nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) activities, which are essential for replication. NS5B and NS5 (flaviviruses) constitute the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. NS1, a secreted protein unique to flaviviruses, plays a role early in replication. HCV and pestivirus NS4B and NS5A proteins, as well as flavivirus NS2A, NS4A and NS4B proteins, have as yet undefined but essential roles in RNA accumulation (reviewed in 1 ).\n\nMany of the features of Flaviviridae replication have been elucidated using viral genomic cDNA clones. Transcription of the genomic RNA in vitro, followed by its transfection into cultured cells is sufficient to launch a full infectious cycle for many flavivirus and pestivirus isolates (see 5, 6 for examples). In contrast, HCV genomes have been extremely difficult to propagate in culture. Emergent mutations and adapted cell lines were able to coax modest levels of RNA replication, but failed to produce progeny virions 7, 8 . In a recent and major advance, a unique patient isolate, termed Japanese fulminant hepatitis 1 (JFH-1) was found to replicate robustly and produce infectious HCV in cell culture 9, 10, 11 . This breakthrough has allowed the previously enigmatic processes of HCV assembly, infectivity, and entry to be investigated for the first time.\n\nThe enveloped virions of the Flaviviridae are thought to arise by budding of the C protein and associated genomic RNA into endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived membranes that are studded with virus envelope glycoproteins (Fig 3) . Although morphogenesis is expected to commence by binding of C to RNA, a packaging signal has not been identified for any member of the Flaviviridae. Nucleocapsids are rarely observed in infected cells, and detailed cryoelectron microscopy image reconstructions of members of the genus Flavivirus have indicated that these virions do not contain an ordered nucleoprotein interior 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 . The basic C protein might instead aggregate with the RNA to neutralize and condense it within the particle 17, 18 , forming a complex that does not make contacts with the envelope 14 . This suggests that the glycoproteins, which form a highly ordered herringbone-like array on the surface of the mature virion 12, 13 , drive morphogenesis through their lateral associations 19 . Consistent with this, subviral particles that contain no C or RNA, are produced in natural flavivirus infections and can be induced by overexpression of the glycoproteins in cells 20 . It is not known whether HCV or pestivirus infection also results in subviral particle production.\n\nAfter budding, Flaviviridae particles are transported through the cellular secretory pathway to the extracellular milieu. For the genus Flavivirus, egress coincides with a massive, acidinduced, reorganization of the glycoproteins, from trimeric spikes 15, 21 to an array of dimers that completely cover the lipid bilayer in a relatively smooth proteinaceous coat 12, 13, 22 . This conformational change allows cleavage of the prM envelope protein by furin in the trans Golgi network 22, 23 . prM functions to protect the fusogenic E protein during transit through the acidic compartments of the secretory pathway 24 and its processing, followed by dissociation of the pr fragment upon particle release 22 , results in mature virions that are primed for low-pH triggered entry into a na\u00efve target cell 24 . The maturation of particles of the genera Hepacivirus and Pestivirus seems to be fundamentally different from that of flaviviruses. Intracellular infectious virus can be released from HCV-25 and pestivirus-26 infected cells, suggesting that these virions mature immediately or rapidly after their formation; postassembly cleavage events analogous to flavivirus prM processing do not seem to be involved. Despite undergoing low-pH dependent entry, HCV and BVDV particles are acid resistant, indicating that unknown factors during uptake, rather than during egress, prime the envelope proteins for fusion 27, 28 . Although HCV virions are infectious soon after they are formed, they undergo physical modification during egress, decreasing in density as they pass through the secretory pathway 25 . The finding that very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) components form essential interactions with HCV during morphogenesis has led to speculation that HCV particles might be closely associated with, or even internalized in, lipid-rich host structures during virus assembly and secretion 29, 30, 31 .\n\nMost nonstructural proteins have essential roles in replication, and it was long thought that these replicase proteins were responsible solely for catalyzing the accumulation of genomic RNA molecules that could subsequently be packaged by the structural proteins. This canonical division of labour was initially supported by the ability of subgenomes that lack the structural region to efficiently undergo RNA synthesis 7, 8, 32, 33 . Whereas replication is independent of the structural proteins, however, packaging of genomes into infectious particles seems to require more than just the physical components of the virion. This Review examines the emerging hypothesis that many Flaviviridae nonstructural proteins are directly and intimately involved in infectious virion morphogenesis, and might orchestrate this complex process at specialized sites of assembly.\n\nOne of the first Flaviviridae nonstructural proteins found to function in infectious virus production was the pestivirus product p7 (Fig 4) 34 . This small hydrophobic protein, which consists of two membrane-spanning helices and a conserved basic cytosolic loop 35, 36 , has a homologue in the hepacivirus but not the flavivirus genome 35, 37, 38 . Deletion of p7 does not affect RNA replication, but completely abrogates the production of infectious pestivirus or HCV particles 34, 39, 40 . Incomplete processing of p7 by signal peptidase results in an accumulation of uncleaved E2-p7, an envelope protein precursor that might be incorporated into virions as a minor component 36, 37, 38, 41, 42 . This fusion protein, however, is not essential for BVDV 34 or HCV 39 infectivity, and neither p7 nor E2-p7 has been detected in pestivirus particles 36 ; studies of HCV virions are ongoing.\n\nSimilarities have been noted between p7 and viroporins, a class of small, hydrophobic, viral proteins that have ion channel activity in vitro, and are involved in enhancing infectivity (Box 1) 34, 35, 43 . HCV and BVDV p7 proteins oligomerize into ion conductive pores in various artificial systems 43, 44, 45, 46 . Although the stoichiometry and specificity of the channels are not known, it has been proposed that HCV p7 forms hexameric 43, 47 or heptameric complexes 48 with a preference for cation conduction 43, 48, 49 . Conserved basic residues within the p7 cytosolic loop are involved in ion channel activity 44, 48 and were found to be essential for infectious pestivirus production 34 , required for induction of HCV viraemia in chimpanzees 50 , and important for optimal growth of HCV in tissue culture 39, 40 . Mutations of residues within the proposed interior of the pore, however, did not drastically affect infectious titres 39, 40 .\n\nViroporins are an expanding group of small (60-100 residue) hydrophobic viral proteins that demonstrate oligomerization and membrane permeablization activities in vitro and in cell-based artificial systems. Viroporins, which can be incorporated in or excluded from the virion, are important for the infectivity of many diverse viruses (reviewed in 104 ). For the majority of viroporins, the relationship between in vitro pore formation and in vivo ion channel activity has not been firmly established, and the importance of ion conduction in the viral life cycle is not clear.\n\nA strict correlation between ion channel activity and an in vivo mechanism of action has, however, been demonstrated for the influenza A virus viroporin, M2 (reviewed in 104, 105, 106 ). M2 is a homotetrameric integral membrane protein that is present in the virus envelope in small amounts. The ability of M2 to selectively conduct protons in a low-pH-activated manner has been demonstrated in planar lipid bilayers, amphibian oocytes, and mammalian cells; a specific inhibitor of in vitro ion conductance, amantadine, blocks influenza A virus growth, with resistance mutations mapping to M2 105, 106 . The M2 protein has dual functions in promoting influenza A virus infectivity. During virus egress, intracellular M2 increases the pH of the Golgi lumen, preventing premature activation of the HA envelope protein.\n\nDuring virus entry, M2 in the virion acidifies the particle interior to facilitate genome uncoating. This concordance of evidence has established that ion conduction by M2 is essential for influenza A virus propagation 105, 106 .\n\nIn contrast, the HIV-1 viroporin Vpu does not seem to invoke an in vivo ion channel activity. Vpu is an integral membrane protein that is excluded from virus particles and accomplishes two distinct roles in HIV-1 infectivity by interactions with host factors (reviewed in 104, 105, 107 ) . Vpu binding to intracellular CD4 targets the virus receptor for degradation. This allows free passage of the envelope precursor, gp160, to the sites of budding, as well as favours virus dissemination to na\u00efve cells. In a recently defined independent role, Vpu colocalizes with and antagonizes tetherin, an antiviral host protein that prevents release of nascent particles from the cell surface 108 .\n\nViroporins have been reported for many other virus families, including Flaviviridae (p7), Coronaviridae (E), Picornaviridae (2B), and Togaviridae (6K); their roles include virus assembly, budding, and egress (reviewed in 104, 109 ). It is not known whether these viroporins function by conducting ions, by interacting with host proteins, or by additional undefined mechanisms. As more is uncovered about the roles of small hydrophobic proteins in virus assembly and infectivity, the focus will likely shift from their similar behaviour in vitro to their diverse mechanisms in vivo, and the classification of viroporin may diverge into functionally defined subsets.\n\nBy analogy to the influenza A virus viroporin M2, an ion channel activity might protect fusogenic glycoproteins in progeny virions from low-pH mediated inactivation during their passage though the Golgi 44 . Although HCV and pestivirus particles transit the low-pH compartments of the secretory pathway, the finding that these virions are acid-resistant until post-release priming suggests that such protection may be unnecessary 27, 28 . Deletion of p7 from either BVDV or HCV blocks an early event in virus assembly, before the formation of infectious intracellular particles 34, 39, 40 , while mutations in the HCV p7 cytosolic loop seem to decrease virion release 40 . This small protein might therefore influence several steps of infectious virus production; indeed multiple roles have been reported for other viroporins. As with the majority of viroporins, it is still unclear how the ion channel and oligomerization properties of p7 relate to its functions in progeny virus assembly and release.\n\nNS2 is a membrane-associated cysteine autoprotease that mediates cleavage of its own carboxyl terminus from NS3 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 . Homologues of this enzyme are present in hepaciviruses and pestiviruses, but not flaviviruses. After liberation of NS3, NS2 is dispensable for RNA replication 7, 8, 32, 53, 56 , but is essential for progeny particle production (Fig 4) 39, 57, 58 . HCV NS2 functions early in morphogenesis, before the assembly of an infectious intracellular virus 39 . This function requires at least the protease domain of NS2, but not its catalytic activity, nor the presence of the uncleaved NS2-3 precursor 39 . In contrast, pestivirus NS2 functions only within the context of uncleaved NS2-3 57,58 ; the post-cleavage form of NS2 does not appear to play any role for pestivirus growth in cell culture 58 . The function of pestivirus uncleaved NS2-3 in morphogenesis does not require the protease activity of NS2, nor the protease, helicase, or NTPase activities of NS3, although cleavage of NS3 from its cofactor, NS4A, is necessary 57, 58 .\n\nWhile the catalytic activities of NS2 and uncleaved NS2-3 are not required for infectious particle production, these enzymes, or the cleavages that they perform, are essential for replication. This dichotomy suggests that regulated expression or activation of these nonstructural proteins might allow switching from RNA synthesis to virion production, a hypothesis illustrated by pestivirus growth 53 . BVDV NS2-3 cleavage, and thus RNA replication, is absolutely dependent on a cellular cofactor termed J-domain protein interacting with viral protein (Jiv) 59, 60 . A single molecule of Jiv binds two sites on NS2, one encompassing the catalytic center and the other close to the substrate region, likely positioning these elements to facilitate processing 59, 61 . After cleavage, NS2 remains bound to Jiv, leading to gradual depletion of this limiting co-factor and eventually preventing further rounds of NS2-3 processing 59 . Titration of Jiv therefore results in the accumulation of uncleaved NS2-3, a plateau of RNA replication, and the commencement of infectious virus production 53 . Interestingly, this regulation of NS2-3 processing is also linked to the ability of BVDV to establish persistent infection. While coordination of RNA replication and virus assembly through NS2-3 cleavage does not seem to occur during HCV growth in cell culture, controlled processing might impact chronic infection in vivo.\n\nThere is evidence that the function of HCV NS2 in infectious progeny assembly requires additional nonstructural proteins. Studies of chimeric genomes encoding sequences from diverse HCV isolates indicated that regions of compatibility within NS2 are major determinants of infectious titre 62, 63 . Specifically, genotypic matching of the amino terminal helix of NS2, p7, and the structural proteins, coupled with pairing of the remainder of NS2 and the replicase proteins led to optimal infectivity 62,63 . These results hint that NS2 might form multiple functional associations, including interactions with p7, as well as possible independent connections with replicase proteins, such as NS3 62, 63 . Indeed, physical interactions between HCV NS2 and NS3 have been reported 64 . Concerted action of NS2 and NS3 might therefore be a common feature of hepacivirus and pestivirus progeny morphogenesis, with possible physical association of the two HCV proteins and a requirement for the pestivirus uncleaved NS2-3 precursor.\n\nThe viruses of the genus Flavivirus do not encode an autoprotease equivalent to NS2. Instead, two hydrophobic proteins that span the membrane several times are encoded upstream of NS3 in the polyprotein. One of these, NS2B, is the NS3 protease cofactor 1 , the other, NS2A, is an essential component of the replicase (Fig 4) 65 . Processing within the NS2A-2B-3 region is carried out by the viral protease, NS3, with its NS2B cofactor. NS2A is also cleaved by the viral protease at a cryptic internal site, creating a truncated form of the protein termed NS2A\u03b1 66 . Mutational analysis revealed that NS2A\u03b1 itself is dispensable for replication and infectivity, but that a basic residue at the cleavage site (K190) is essential for production of infectious YFV 67 . Mutation of K190 did not affect subviral particle secretion, suggesting that NS2A plays an important role in the incorporation of genomic RNA into the budding virion 67 . Residues in NS2A (I59 and T149) have also been implicated in the production of infectious Kunjin virus (KUN) 68, 69 .\n\nNS2A interacts with other nonstructural proteins, including NS3 70 . Interestingly, second-site changes in the helicase domain of NS3 were found to suppress the assembly defect caused by mutation of the NS2A\u03b1 cleavage site 67 . These findings suggest that, similar to HCV and the pestiviruses, physical associations between the multifunctional NS3 enzyme and an upstream membrane associated protein are essential for infectious flavivirus morphogenesis. Unlike HCV NS2 and pestivirus uncleaved NS2-3, which are not required for RNA replication, NS2A colocalizes with replication complexes 70 and has an essential, but poorly understood, role in the process of RNA accumulation 65 . Purified NS2A binds RNA, leading to the hypothesis that this integral membrane protein might shuttle genomic substrates out of membrane bound replication complexes to the sites of packaging 68, 70 .\n\nTo date, the only clearly understood mechanism of action for a nonstructural protein in Flaviviridae progeny virus production is the proteolytic role of the NS3 protease from the genus Flavivirus (Fig 4) . This enzyme, together with the NS2B cofactor, mediates cleavage of the flavivirus C protein from its membrane anchor, and is therefore essential for maturation of a major virion component. Processing of C on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane by the flaviviral protease is essential for subsequent cleavage of C from the envelope protein, prM, by the host enzyme signal peptidase in the ER lumen 71, 72 . This regulated sequence of cleavages ensures that processing of prM from the polyprotein is delayed, and budding is stalled, until genomic RNA substrates accumulate through replication; the secretion of the flavivirus glycoproteins, E and prM, as immunogenic subviral particles is thereby minimized 71, 72, 73 . Inspection of C protein sequences from the genera Pestivirus and Hepacivirus revealed the presence of conserved NS3 protease recognition sites in the corresponding membrane anchors 57, 74 . Subsequently, however, it was found that a host enzyme, signal peptide peptidase, processed both proteins 75, 76 . Although NS3 might interact with C without initiating proteolysis, studies of HCV have shown that mutation of the putative cleavage site residues in C does not drastically affect virus titres 77 . It is not known if other mechanisms delay budding for these viruses.\n\nWhile a proteolytic role for NS3 in assembly might be unique to flaviviruses, the discovery of an essential function for pestivirus uncleaved NS2-3 that is independent of its known enzymatic activities, suggested analogous additional roles for NS3 proteins of the Flavivirus and Hepacivirus genera 57,58 . This hypothesis was supported by the finding that NS3 of the flavivirus, KUN, can function in trans for C processing and RNA replication, but must be supplied in cis for infectious virus to be produced 78, 79 . YFV NS3, which is not absolutely required in cis 80 , was recently directly implicated in flavivirus morphogenesis 81 . A single tryptophan residue in the helicase domain is dispensable for RNA replication but essential for nucleocapsid incorporation and possibly other aspects of particle specific infectivity 81 . By complementation in trans, this function of NS3 in infectious virus assembly was shown to be independent of its protease, helicase and NTPase activities 81 . NS3 has also been implicated in the production of HCV progeny, as adaptive mutations in this region have been found to augment infectious titres of viruses passaged in cell culture 63, 82 . For a minimally infectious intergenotypic chimaera, titres were specifically increased by the emergence of a point mutation in the NS3 helicase domain 63 . This mutation rescued infectious virus production without affecting RNA replication, or the known catalytic activities of NS3 (M. Yi and S. Lemon, personal communication).\n\nCofactors NS4A and NS2B (flavivirus) contribute to the structure of NS3, anchor the enzyme to the membrane, are required for the majority of NS3-mediated processing events, and can modulate its helicase activity (reviewed in 1 ). Although the known enzymatic activities of NS3 are not required for infectious pestivirus production, the presence of the NS4A cofactor significantly increases the activity of the essential precursor, uncleaved NS2-3, in this process (Fig 4) 57, 58 . NS4A can be functionally supplied in trans to uncleaved NS2-3, but it cannot be recruited from an active replication complex, and fragments or full-length NS4A sequences that cannot be cleaved from the NS2-3 precursor are highly inhibitory to its function 57, 58 . This requirement for available NS4A might indicate that a specific conformation of the NS3 protease is essential for the function of uncleaved NS2-3 in virion morphogenesis. Alternatively, NS4A could bind and recruit additional essential factors to the sites of assembly 58 . The flavivirus protease cofactor, NS2B, is also involved in infectious virus production by facilitating NS3mediated cleavage of C 71, 72 . Additional functions of NS3 in assembly and infectivity, however, do not require cis-encoded NS2B 81 . It remains to be tested whether the emerging role for HCV NS3 in progeny virus production will include a requirement for NS4A.\n\nThe zinc-binding NS5A proteins of HCV and the pestiviruses 83, 84 have essential but undefined roles in RNA replication; no enzymatic activity has been ascribed to them (Fig 5) . For both genera, these proteins are basally phosphorylated on serines by what seems to be the same cellular kinase(s) 85, 86 ; HCV NS5A is also a substrate for casein kinase I (CKI)-\u03b1-mediated hyperphosphorylation 85, 87 . A regulatory role for NS5A phosphorylation has long been suspected, and was supported by observations that adaptive mutations 7 , engineered mutations 88 , or kinase inhibitors 89 that decrease hyperphosphorylation increase RNA replication but abolish HCV infectivity in chimpanzees 90 . The finding that hyperphosphorylation inhibited the ability of NS5A to bind an essential cellular component of the replicase, hVAP-A, suggested that this modification might serve as a switch to break apart the replication complex and allow infectious virus assembly to begin 91, 92 .\n\nRecently, it has been proposed that HCV infectious particle assembly takes place at membraneassociated lipid droplets. These are fatty intracellular deposits at which active replication complexes and envelope proteins congregate in a C-dependent manner 93 . Mutations within the amino-terminal domain of NS5A (residues 99-104) were found to impair recruitment of the replicase to lipid droplets, while deletions in the carboxy-terminal region of NS5A disrupted its colocalization with C on these structures 94 ; both types of mutations decreased virus titres, suggesting a direct role for NS5A in infectious virus production 93, 94 . An independent mutational analysis of NS5A identified a single residue (S457) that is dispensable for RNA replication but essential for infectious particle assembly 95 . Substitution of this serine with alanine abolished infectious titres, while mutation to aspartic acid, which mimicks phosphorylation, rescued the production of progeny virus 95 . The aspartic acid mutant, but not the wild-type genome, produced normal levels of infectious virus in the presence of casein kinase II (CKII) inhibitors 95 . This evidence, along with the finding that the serine to aspartic acid change slightly decreased RNA replication, suggested that CKII-dependent phosphorylation of NS5A S457 might mediate a switch between replication and assembly. Although it is not clear whether this serine is part of the basal or hyperphosphorylated subsets, mutations at this position seemed to reduce hyperphosphorylation 95 . These studies provide compelling evidence that NS5A is a central regulator of virion morphogenesis. Temporally regulated phosphorylation of this protein might influence the localization of replication complexes or impact the partitioning of nascent positive-strand RNA molecules between the competing fates of translation, replication, and encapsidation. Modification of NS5A might also disrupt the replicase machinery, thereby releasing genomes for infectious virus formation.\n\nThe flavivirus genome does not encode a homologue of NS5A; its NS5 protein has RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and methyltransferase activities, which are important for RNA synthesis and genome capping respectively (Fig 5) . Despite no sequence similarity to NS5A, NS5 has a zinc-binding motif 96 and is phosphorylated by a putative NS5A-kinase 86 , suggesting functional homology between these proteins 86 . Evidence that DEN NS5 localizes and interacts with NS3 only when hypophosphorylated implies that this protein might also mediate a phosphorylation-dependent relocalization, or disruption, of the replicase complex 97 . Studies of KUN have revealed that the polymerase activity of NS5 is a prerequisite for assembly, since replication-incompetent genomes were not substrates for incorporation into virions 98 . Pestivirus and hepacivirus RdRp activity is encoded in NS5B. Although it is not known if these genomes must replicate in order to be packaged, BVDV NS5B has been directly implicated in morphogenesis. Insertion of an epitope tag in the carboxy-terminal region of the polymerase was found to abolish infectious virus production while not affecting RNA replication 99 .\n\nThese data suggest that NS5A, NS5B, and NS5 (flaviviruses) might be central to the regulation and coupling of RNA synthesis and virion morphogenesis, a link that likely depends on physical connections between membranous sites of replication and assembly 93, 98 . Immunoelectronmicroscopy of KUN-infected cells has visualized flavivirus structural proteins at modified membranes proximal to vesicle packets that are thought to be the sites of RNA replication 100 . Similar membranous structures have been observed in pestivirus-infected, as well as in HCV-infected cells 3, 4 . HCV replication and assembly seem to converge at lipid droplets 93 , a unique adaptation that may position budding particles for egress in association with VLDL. Hepatocytes are among the few cell types that secrete lipoproteins, suggesting that utilization of this pathway may dictate the highly restricted tropism of this virus 31 . Coupling of replication and virion formation at membranous intracellular structures might be envisioned to limit the propagation of defective genomes, and may be essential in the context of the highly error-prone RdRp activities 98 . Direct transfer of RNA from an active replication complex to an assembling particle might also provide a mechanism for specific genome encapsidation in the absence of a packaging signal 94 .\n\nNonstructural factors might be expected to form transient physical interactions with virion components in order to orchestrate their assembly, indeed it is possible that replicase proteins are incorporated into virus particles at levels below the current limits of detection. Flavivirus NS3 is known to interact with C, as it cleaves the hydrophobic anchor from this structural protein 72 . Passaging of assembly-defective HCV genomes has revealed multiple genetic interactions between structural and nonstructural sequences. Intergenotypic incompatibility of the C-NS2 region with the replicase proteins could be overcome by a compensatory mutation in E1 that acts synergistically with changes in NS2 or NS3 63 , while genomes with deleterious mutations in C were rescued to various degrees by emergent mutations in p7, NS2 and NS3 82 . Evidence for physical interactions between NS2 and E2 101 , as well as NS5A and C 102 , has also been uncovered. The functional cooperation between NS5A and C in the recruitment of structural and replicase components to lipid droplets as a prerequisite for infectious HCV assembly has emphasized the importance of these associations 93 .\n\nWhile the formation of an infectious virus certainly requires concerted action by the structural proteins, evidence highlighted here underscores the importance of nonstructural proteins in this complex process. All Flaviviridae seem to share some common requirements for infectious virus production: coordination of the multifunctional NS3 protein with upstream hydrophobic sequences, and the coupling of replication to assembly through the functions of a replicase phosphoprotein and the RdRp. Nonstructural proteins that are involved in these processes might mediate localization of active replication complexes to specialized sites of assembly, regulate the release of RNA from the replicase, or ensure genome incorporation into a budding particle. Additional nonstructural proteins that are absent from the flavivirus genome might address unique requirements of HCV and pestivirus morphogenesis. The apparently coordinated roles of p7 and NS2 could participate in the initiation of virion assembly, mediate glycoprotein organization and budding, or ensure particle maturation, processes that may have diverged mechanistically from the flaviviruses.\n\nOnce thought to function solely in the accumulation of viral RNA, Flaviviridae nonstructural proteins are now emerging as integral players in the process of virion morphogenesis. With almost every nonstructural protein now implicated in progeny virus production, much work remains in assigning their specific roles and elucidating their mechanisms of action. Ultimately it may be possible to exploit these essential functions in the development of antiviral drugs to treat the devastating infections caused by this group of viruses. The positive-sense RNA genomes of the Flaviviridae are translated to yield a single hypothetical polyprotein, which is processed by viral and cellular enzymes. The proposed topologies of the viral proteins with respect to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, and the enzymes involved in their liberation from the polyprotein are indicated 1 . Structural proteins are shown in yellow, nonstructural proteins are shown in green (required for infectious virus production) or blue (have not been implicated in infectious virus production). Flaviviridae particles arise through envelopment of the nucleoprotein complex by an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane displaying the viral glycoproteins (E1 and E2, hepacivirus; E rns , E1, and E2, pestivirus; prM, E, flavivirus). Virions then transit from the ER lumen to the cell surface via the secretory pathway. Hepacivirus morphogenesis is believed to take place in association with membrane-apposed lipid droplets, fatty deposits at which replication complexes also accumulate 93 . HCV particles appear to become associated with very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) during assembly or egress 29, 30, 31 . Pestivirus particles are also proposed to form in the ER before transport through the secretory pathway 3 . HCV and pestivirus virions are infectious immediately or rapidly after budding 25, 26 . Flavivirus particles are immature until acid-induced rearrangement of the envelope protein E, and furin-mediated cleavage of glycoprotein prM to M in a late Golgi compartment 22, 23 . The formation of capsid and RNA-deficient subviral particles is a hallmark of flavivirus infections. The multifunctional enzyme NS3 and its hydrophobic neighbours in the polyprotein are emerging as conserved requirements for Flaviviridae progeny virion production. The determinants of this region involved in proteolysis, RNA replication, and infectious virus production are shown. Pro, protease; Hel/NTP, helicase/nucleoside triphosphatase; yellow, hydrophobic sequences involved in membrane association; orange, zinc-coordination motifs. Green, required region; blue, implicated through adaptive mutations; dark grey, of unknown importance; white circle, enzymatic activity required; black circle, enzymatic activity not required; grey circle, enzymatic activity of unknown importance; black arrow head, site of processing by indicated catalytic activity; white arrow head, cryptic site of processing by indicated catalytic activity. NS2-mediated autoproteolysis of its carboxy terminus from NS3 is an essential step in hepacivirus and pestivirus polyprotein processing. The protease domain of NS3 is required for the catalytic activity of HCV NS2; the involvement of the zinc-binding site, but not the enzymatic activity, of NS3 suggests a structural contribution 51, 52, 55 . Pestivirus NS2 protease activity requires only two residues of NS3 53,61 , but depends on the entire NS2 membrane-associated domain 53 and on a cellular cofactor, Jiv 59, 60 . NS3 protease activity is present in the amino-terminal domains of the hepacivirus, pestivirus, and flavivirus proteins; NS3 also possesses helicase/NTPase activity. HCV and pestivirus NS4A and flavivirus NS2B proteins are essential cofactors for NS3-mediated proteolysis 1 . Replication requires the protease and helicase/NTPase functions of NS3. HCV and pestivirus NS2 proteins are not involved in RNA accumulation after release of NS3 7, 8, 32 ; flavivirus NS2A and NS2B are essential 65 . Infectious virus production by HCV and pestivirus genomes requires the p7 protein 34, 39, 40 . HCV morphogenesis also depends on a function of NS2 that is independent of its protease activity 39 , and a role for NS3 has been suggested by emergent mutations 63, 82 . Infectious pestivirus production requires the uncleaved NS2-3 precursor protein in conjunction with NS4A, again without a requirement for the known enzymatic activities of NS2 or NS3 57, 58 . Flavivirus morphogenesis requires NS2A, likely in cooperation with NS3 67,68,81 ; in a second, proteolytic role, NS3 and its cofactor NS2B are important for capsid protein processing 71,72,73 . 98 and changes in pestivirus NS5B have been shown to specifically abolish infectious virus production 99 ."}
