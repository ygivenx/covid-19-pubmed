{"title": "Comparative analysis of gene expression in virulent and attenuated strains of infectious bronchitis virus at sub-codon resolution", "body": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a member of the genus Gammacoronavirus and the causative agent of avian infectious bronchitis. IBV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome ~27 kb in length and, like all coronaviruses, produces a set of sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNAs) synthesised via the viral polymerase. Here, we used RNA sequencing (RNASeq) and ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) to delineate gene expression in the IBV M41-CK and Beau-CK strains at subcodon resolution. Quantification of reads flanking the programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal at the genomic RNA ORF1a/ORF1b junction revealed that PRF in IBV is highly efficient (33-40%), consistent with in vitro measurements. Triplet phasing of the profiling data allowed precise determination of reading frames and revealed the translation of two intergenic genes (4b and 4c on sgmRNA4), which are widely conserved across IBV isolates. RNASeq revealed two novel transcription junction sites in the attenuated Beau-CK strain, one of which would generate a sgmRNA encoding a ribosomally occupied ORF in the viral 3' untranslated region (dORF). Within IBV transcripts, the nucleocapsid (N) protein was unexpectedly found to be inefficiently translated, despite being an abundant structural component of mature IBV virions. Finally, we demonstrate that the host cell response to IBV occurs primarily at the level of transcription, with a global upregulation of immune-related mRNA transcripts following infection, and comparatively modest changes in the translation efficiencies of host genes.\n\nIBV is a major avian pathogen and presents a substantial economic burden to the poultry industry. \n\nNidovirales) and a pathogen of the domestic fowl (Cavanagh, 2005) . IBV infects primarily the epithelial cells of upper and lower respiratory tract tissues, though infections can also spread to the alimentary canal, as well as to the kidneys, testes and oviduct (Cavanagh, 2007) . The monopartite, polycistronic genomic RNA (gRNA) of IBV is approximately 28 kb in length, and -like those of other coronaviruses -it is 5\u2032-methyl-capped and 3\u2032-polyadenylated (Gorbalenya et al., 2006) . Two large open reading frames (ORFs) -ORF1a and ORF1b -are situated within the 5\u2032-proximal twothirds of the genome. Translation of the former yields a ca. 3,950-aa polyprotein (pp1a); whereas translation of the latter requires \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) (Brierley et al., 1987; 1989) giving rise to a ca. 6,630-aa polyprotein (pp1ab). These polyproteins are cleaved to yield the components of the membrane-bound replication-transcription complex (RTC) (Liu et al., 1997; Brockway et al., 2003; Sawicki et al., 2007) . A feature of coronavirus replication is the synthesis of a nested, 3\u2032-coterminal set of subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) encoding the viral structural and accessory proteins. The 5\u2032 end of each sgmRNA comprises a 56-nt sequence derived from the 5' end of the genome, the so-called leader sequence (Brown et al., 1986; RiboSeq and RNASeq libraries were prepared from two biological repeats each of Beau-CKinfected, M41-CK-infected, and mock-infected cells. An average of 1,156,819 RPFs and 1,727,024\n\nRNASeq reads were mapped to viral gRNA in the virus-infected RiboSeq libraries (Supp. Table   S1 ). The RNASeq read coverage in the library derived from the second biological repeat of M41-CK-infected cells was lower than that of other libraries due to technical losses. However, 106,741 reads were mapped to the forward strand of the viral gRNA in this case -corresponding to a coverage of approximately 3.8-fold -and these reads were generally evenly distributed along the gRNA; hence, the sequencing depth in this replicate was deemed sufficient for further analysis. The vast majority of RPFs mapping to viral and host protein-coding regions were between 27 and 29 nt in length (Supp. Fig. S1 ), consistent with the size of the RNA fragment protected by translating eukaryotic ribosomes from digestion by RNase I (Wolin and Walter, 1988) . The length distributions of RNASeq reads were much broader, in line with the size of the gel slice excised for sequencing of fragmented RNA. RPF length was strongly related to the RPF phase relative to the reading frame of the associated coding region: 27-nt RPFs were primarily in the +1 phase; whereas 28-and 29-nt RPFs were primarily in the 0 phase (Supp. Fig. S2 ). As expected, RNASeq reads were far more evenly split over the three phases, with a slight bias towards phase 0 (Supp. Fig. S3 ), which may reflect codon usage bias -such as a preference for the use of RNY codons (Jukes, 1996; Fuchs et al., 2015; Irigoyen et al., 2016) -compounded with adaptor-ligation bias during library preparation.\n\nA meta analysis of host mRNA coding regions showed that the depth of coverage of RiboSeq 5\u2032 read ends increased substantially 12 nt upstream of the AUG (initiation) codon for RPFs in phase 0 (generally 28-and 29-nt RPFs), and 11-nt upstream of the AUG codon for RPFs in phase +1 (generally 27-nt RPFs) (Supp. Figs. S4 and S5 ). This indicates that the ribosomal P-site is situated at an offset of 11 and 12 nt from the 5\u2032 ends of RPFs for 27-nt and 28-/29-nt reads, respectively (Ingolia et al., 2011) . Peaks in RNASeq 5\u2032-read end coverage were seen at the A of initiation (AUG) and M41 (panel B) genomes. In both cases, the density of RPFs was considerably higher towards the 3\u2032 ends of the gRNA, consistent with production of the 3\u2032 co-terminal nested set of sgmRNAs.\n\nIn contrast, RiboSeq coverage of the ORF1a and ORF1b coding sequences was relatively low; reflecting the fact that a substantial proportion of newly synthesised gRNA (but not sgmRNA) transcripts are likely to be destined for packaging rather than translation (Kuo and Masters, 2013) .\n\nOn average, negative-sense RNASeq reads were present at 0.28% of the level of positive-sense reads on average, indicating a ratio of positive:negative stranded RNA of ~350:1 at 24 h p.i., a ratio similar to that seen in ribosome profiling studies of the betacoronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Irigoyen et al., 2016) . Negative-sense RPFs, which may represent contamination from ribonucleoprotein complexes (Irigoyen et al., 2016) , were observed but at low abundance (0.03% of the level of positive-sense RPFs).\n\nThe density of RNASeq reads mapping to a given sgmRNA represents the cumulative sum of reads derived from the gRNA and those derived from the overlapping portions of other subgenomic transcripts (Fig. 1) . Therefore, to estimate the abundance of individual sgmRNAs, two independent approaches were used. First, we \"decumulated\" the raw RNASeq read densities mapping to inter-TRS regions, by subtracting the density of the 5\u2032-adjacent inter-TRS region in each case (Irigoyen et al., 2016) . Secondly, the abundances of chimeric RNASeq reads spanning TRS junctions were quantified, by identifying unmapped reads containing an 11-nt sequence derived from the leader region, 5\u2032-adjacent to the TRS-L (UAGAUUUUUAA, nt 46 -56 in Beaudette; UAGAUUUCCAA, nt 46 -56 in M41), and including at least 16 nt 3\u2032 of this query. Chimeric reads were assigned to specific genomic loci based on the sequences 3\u2032 of the TRS in each case (Supp . Table S2 ; Fig. 2A) .\n\nOverall, the chimeric read abundances for sgmRNAs were significantly correlated with the corresponding decumulated RNASeq densities (P < 0.01 in both cases) (Supp. Fig. S8 ). The sequence logos in Fig. 2B and Fig. 2C illustrate the diversity of nucleotides found at TRS-B sites identified in this study (including the novel sites discussed below) in Beaudette and M41, respectively. The core region of similarity to the TRS-L motif (CUUAACAA) is typically flanked by a 3\u2032 adenine (A) or uracil (U) residue, and a preference for A/U residues is also seen immediately upstream of the core sequence. These flanking residues may facilitate template switching by lowering the free energy of anti-TRS-B/TRS-B duplex disassociation, since the TRS-L is also located in an AU-rich region (Sola et al., 2005) .\n\nNotably, the A nucleotides at positions four and seven of the core motif are the only invariant residues. In both Beaudette and M41, the TRS-B sequences associated with the S gene contain G residues at the third positions (CUGAACAA); in contrast to the TRS-L, which has a U at this position (CUUAACAA) (Supp . Table S2 ). Chimeric reads assigned to this gene were found to contain either a U or a G residue at position three (denoted \"S [U3]\" and \"S [G3]\", respectively, in Table S2 ); with a G being more common in M41 (7.5% of reads compared with 5.8%, on average) and a U being more common in Beaudette (2.1% of reads compared with 1.5%, on average) (Supp . Table S2 ). These data indicate that the exact position at which discontinuous transcription occurs within a given TRS is subject to some variation, with either the TRS-L or the TRS-B templating the third residue. Similarly, the TRS-B for the 3a/3b/E genes diverges at the third position between Beaudette (CUGAACAA; nt 23825 -23832) and M41 (CUUAACAA; nt 23832 -8   150   151   152   153   154   155   156 23839), with the latter matching the TRS-L sequence exactly. In this case, we found that Beaudettederived chimeric reads could contain either a U (denoted \"3/E [U3]\") or a G (denoted \"3/E [G3]\"), with the G residue being slightly more common (1.6% versus 1.2%, respectively, on average); whereas M41-derived reads contained only the U residue ( Fig. 2A ; Supp. Table S2 ).\n\nIn agreement with a previous report (Stirrups et al., 2000) , we found that the 3\u2032-most of two adjacent canonical TRS nt 25, 467 and nt 25, 478 , labelled \"5a/5b TRS 1\" and \"5a/5b TRS 2\", respectively, in Fig. 2A ) within the 30-nt region upstream of genes 5a/5b was preferentially utilised in IBV Beaudette; accounting for 18.8% of chimeric reads on average, compared with 1.5% for the 5\u2032-most TRS-B. Interestingly, more chimeric reads were assigned to the non-canonical TRS-B associated with genes 4b/4c (Bentley et al., 2013) -which has a low homology to the TRS-L (Supp . Table S2 ) -than to the first of these 5a/5b-associated TRSs in IBV Beaudette; emphasising the importance of the genomic context in facilitating discontinuous transcription ( Fig. 2B and Fig. 2C ) (Sola et al., 2005) . Only one of the two 5a/5b TRSs (TRS 2) is found in the IBV M41 genome ( Fig. 2A) .\n\nTwo additional non-canonical leader/body chimeras were identified, both specific to the Beaudette strain (Supp. Table S2 ). The more abundant of these (0.6% of chimeric reads) mapped to a position immediately downstream of the IBV Beaudette N gene termination codon, within the 3\u2032 \"untranslated\" region (UTR). Chimeric reads derived from this site contained the sequence CUUAACAU; the last six nt of which could have been templated by the genomic (TRS-B) sequence (UAACAU, nt 27104 -27109) . There is an AUG-initiated downstream ORF (dORF) in Beaudette beginning two nt 3\u2032 of this TRS, which comprises 11 codons (nt 27111 -nt 27143). The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/612614 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nInspection of our RiboSeq libraries shows that the dORF is ribosomally occupied (Fig. 2D) . Such AUG-initiated dORFs are present immediately 3\u2032 of the N genes in most IBV strains, and in TCoV, but this region appears to have been ancestrally deleted in the IBV M41 lineage; and M41 also lacks the TRS-B downstream of the N gene (UAAAAU, nt 27156 -27161).\n\nThe second novel chimeric sequence identified in RNASeq libraries maps to a TRS-B (CUUACCAA) within the coding region of the S gene in Beaudette (nt 21242 -21249). This is consistent with the previous detection of a sgmRNA of appropriate length via Northern blot analysis (Bentley et al., 2013) . Whilst the core sequence of the TRS-B in this case is conserved in M41, there is a single nucleotide (A to C) polymorphism located four nt downstream in the 3\u2032 flanking region, which may contribute to its lack of utilisation in this strain (Supp. Table S2 ).\n\nRibosome profiling of eukaryotic systems typically has the characteristic that mappings of the 5\u2032 end positions of RPFs to coding sequences reflect the triplet periodicity of genetic decoding. A clear phase transition is evident in the RiboSeq libraries at the junction of ORF1a and ORF1b; where frameshifting of a proportion of ribosomes from the former ORF into the latter occurs ( Fig. 3A and   3B ). The mean normalised ratios of ORF1b to ORF1a RiboSeq density were 0.32 and 0.37 in IBV Beaudette and IBV M41, respectively; while the corresponding RNASeq ratios were 0.97 and 0.94, respectively (Fig. 3C) . Thus on average, 33% of ribosomes in Beaudette and 39% in M41 undergo -1 PRF prior to reaching the ORF1a termination codon (Fig. 3D) . These values are very similar to those measured in in vitro PRF assays (Brierley et al., 1987 (Brierley et al., , 1989 and alongside related profiling studies of MHV (Irigoyen et al., 2016) , this indicates that coronaviruses exhibit highly efficient PRF both in vitro and in the context of the infected cell. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/612614 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nSituated between the M and 5a genes in Beaudette and M41 is a >300-nt ostensibly \"intergenic\" region (IGR) (Fig. 1) . No protein-coding genes are annotated here but two putative AUG-initiated ORFs are present in each virus, referred to as ORF4b and ORF4c, after their homologs in turkey coronavirus [TCoV] (Gomaa et al., 2008; Cao et al., 2008) and in the genomes of most IBV isolates Fig. S9 ). Thus, in Beaudette, the two ORFs are separated by a 3-nt spacer region and in the same reading frame (Fig. 4A) ; whereas in M41, ORF4c is located entirely within the ORF4b gene and in the +1 phase (Fig. 4B) . Inspection of the ribosomal profiling datasets reveals substantial RPF coverage of both ORF4b and ORF4c, providing the first clear illustration that ORFs 4b and 4c are ribosomally occupied (Fig. 4) . Visualisation of ORF4c translation in M41 was facilitated by good phasing in the datasets, allowing expression of both ORF4b and ORF4c to be visualised (as both blue and orange RPF peaks in the overlap region). Previous work (Bentley et al., 2013) has shown that a non-canonical TRS-B sequence -situated approximately 100 nt upstream of the M gene termination codon -facilitates production of a sgmRNA that harbours ORF4b at its 5\u2032 end, and this TRS-B was also identified in our RNASeq data.\n\nTo estimate the translational efficiency (TE) of virus genes, we summed RPFs whose 5\u2032 end mapped in-phase between the first nucleotide of the initiation codon and 30 nt 5\u2032 of the termination codon; The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/612614 doi: bioRxiv preprint thereby excluding RPFs derived from ribosomes paused during initiation or termination (Irigoyen et al., 2016) . The TE of each ORF was measured as the quotient of the RPF density and the abundance of the corresponding mRNA; with separate calculations performed using the decumulated RNASeq densities and the TRS chimeric reads counts ( Fig. 5 and Supp. Fig. S10 , respectively). In the case of ORF4b and ORF4c, transcript abundance could not be accurately deduced via the RNASeq decumulation procedure, because the significantly lower level of expression of the 4b/4c transcript relative to that of the 5\u2032-adjacent M gene ( Fig. 1) was associated with a proportionate increase in the level of noise. Similarly, as a result of the high abundance of gRNA relative to the sgmRNA encoding S, the decumulated RNASeq density for the latter is likely to be poorly estimated, and therefore the TE value for S calculated using the chimeric read count is likely to be more accurate.\n\nFrom this analysis, it was observed that the 4b gene is more efficiently translated than the 4c gene; a trend also observed for the accessory genes 3a/3b and 5a/5b (Fig. 5) . This is consistent with the likely requirement for leaky scanning to access the downstream ORF on each sgmRNA (see Discussion) . Surprisingly, despite the fact that the nucleocapsid (N) protein is an abundant viral protein, it was not found to be efficiently translated relative to the other structural proteins, regardless of the approach used to estimate transcript abundance ( Fig. 5; Supp. Fig. S10 ). In the case of the ORF1a and ORF1b genes, a large proportion of the genomic RNA is expected to be destined for packaging rather than translation, as mentioned above, and this probably explains the low TE values calculated for these genes ( Fig. 5; Supp. Fig. S10) . Additionally, the short length of the dORF precluded an accurate assessment of its translation efficiency. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/612614 doi: bioRxiv preprint Inspection of the profiling datasets revealed a number of genomic locations where RPFs accumulated to a much higher level than at neighbouring sites, indicative of ribosomal pausing. As such pauses may have biological significance, we first sought to discount those that may have arisen artefactually. The known translation initiation sites in the virus genome generally showed high ribosome occupancy, but as the infected cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX) prior to lysis to \"freeze\" ribosomes onto the mRNA, these pauses are likely to be over-represented, as ribosomes can accumulate at start codons during the CHX treatment period (Ingolia et al., 2011) . Fluctuations in RPF density can also occur as a result of nuclease, ligation, and PCR biases during library construction. As the latter two biases can also occur during RNASeq library generation, we also discounted any pauses that had an obvious counterpart in RNASeq datasets. With these criteria, we identified five obvious sites of ribosomal pausing conserved in Beaudette and M41, one in the 5\u2032 UTR and four within the coding region (indicated in Fig. 1 , purple triangles; see Table 1 ). Pauses in 5\u2032 UTRs can represent ribosomes initiating at upstream ORFs (uORFs), although in both Beaudette and M41, the P-site of the ribosome paused over bases 28-56 in the 5\u2032 UTR of the genome is on a non-AUG codon (UUG) in a weak Kozak initiation consensus. As this pause is located upstream of the TRS_L, it reflects the sum of pausing on all sgmRNAs. To view the extent of the pause in context, we remapped reads to the most abundant sgmRNA, i.e. that of the N gene ( Fig. 6) . As can be seen, the \"Leader pause\" remains clearly evident (as is a smaller pause three codons downstream), albeit smaller in magnitude than those pauses seen at an N uORF (see below) and the authentic AUG codon of the N protein. Initiation at the UUG codon would result in translation of solely a dipeptide and thus the pause, if biologically relevant, may act as a regulator of downstream initiation events rather than through the encoded product. We note that an equivalent Leader pause is seen in MHV (UUG codon, 1-codon ORF; Irigoyen et al., 2016) . It is possible that pausing at this codon is potentiated by queueing of initiating ribosomes on sgmRNAs. The origin of the pauses The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/612614 doi: bioRxiv preprint within the coding region are enigmatic. The two adjacent pauses referred to collectively as Pause 2 in Table 1 correspond to translation of a region of non-structural protein 4 (nsP4) downstream of the membrane spanning domains (Oostra et al., 2007; Doyle et al., 2018) . It is feasible that ribosomes pause here whilst the nascent peptide is being folded into membranes. Pauses 3 and 4 are noticeably large and correspond to ribosomes pausing soon after initiation of the S and M proteins, respectively. In the case of the former, the pause appears to be unrelated to the signal sequence at the N-terminus of the S protein, since this would still be within the peptide exit tunnel of paused ribosomes. Pause 5 corresponds to a potential non-AUG uORF (AUU, in a reasonable context) within the N mRNA ( Fig. 6) .\n\nIt is noteworthy that in our analysis of ribosomal pause sites, we did not see pausing at the AUG of the previously described 11 amino acid uORF of the genomic mRNA (AUG at nt 131-133; Boursnell et al., 1987) , and indeed there were few reads on the uORF itself, indicating that it is not heavily translated. Further, no pausing was observed at the PRF site at the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap.\n\nWe investigated the differential transcription and translation of host genes in response to IBV infection by comparing RNA and RPF densities per coding region for infected samples and mocks (see Materials and Methods). Details of the genes found to be differentially expressed (DEGs) (FDR < 0.05 with multiple testing correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg method) at the level of transcription (4,266 genes) or translation (3,627 genes) respectively, are provided in Supp. Data Sets S1 and S2. Overall The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/612614 doi: bioRxiv preprint respectively, P values both < 2.2 \uf0b4 10 \u221216 ; Fig. 7A ). Notably, the majority of differentially transcribed genes were up-regulated rather than down-regulated (i.e. log2FC > 0) for both strains immune-related pathways were among the most significantly enriched terms in the core response sets ( Fig. 7B and Fig. 7C ). There was also evidence of integration and coordination of responses at the transcriptional and translational levels. For example, the GO term \"positive regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity\" (GO:0051092) was enriched among transcriptionally upregulated genes; whereas \"negative regulation of NF-kappaB transcription factor activity\" (GO:0032088) was enriched among translationally down-regulated genes. In a direct inter-strain comparison of statistically significant DEGs we identified 51 differentially transcribed genes, 45 of which were more highly expressed in Beaudette-infected samples, and six of which were more highly expressed in M41-infected samples (Supp. Data Set S1). The most significantly enriched GO term in the former set was \"regulation of signaling receptor activity\" (GO:0010469); while proproliferative and anti-apoptotic GO terms were also enriched (Supp. Table S3 ). The latter set included three heat shock protein-encoding genes, and consequently the top enriched GO terms were related to \"protein refolding\" (Supp .

Analysis of RNASeq data sets through chimeric read analysis or decumulation allowed us to quantify the relative levels of viral genomic and subgenomic mRNAs and to define the sequence diversity of strain-specific TRS utilisation. The predominant sgmRNA in both strains was that encoding the N protein, and between strains, the M transcript was relatively more abundant in M41. In Beaudette, two novel TRS were identified, one in the viral 3\u2032 UTR immediately downstream of the N gene termination codon, and one mapping to a TRS-B within the S gene. In the former, a short ORF (dORF) -initiated two nt 3\u2032 of the TRS -is present and ribosomally occupied. The potential biological relevance of this ORF remains to be determined; The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/612614 doi: bioRxiv preprint such dORFs are present in most IBV strains and in TCoV, but it is lacking in M41 (as is the TRS-B). A recent report has described the same sgmRNA (initiating at the identical TRS) as a novel noncoding RNA of IBV . The S gene TRS -B, proposed earlier (Bentley et al., 2013) , was also identified.\n\nRiboSeq analysis, in conjunction with RNASeq, revealed that the N protein is not more efficiently translated than other structural proteins, despite being a structural component of IBV virions.\n\nCoronaviral N proteins are highly basic, reflecting the fact that they associate tightly with the negatively charged gRNA (Laude et al., 1995) , and a previous meta-analysis has indicated that the decoding of positively charged amino acid residues is associated with a lowering in the speed of translation (Charneski and Hurst 2013; Sabi & Tuller, 2015; Requiao et al., 2016) . Thus, it is possible that the relatively low TE of N is an unavoidable consequence of its amino acid composition. N expression may also be regulated by a putative uORF whose initiation codon is located some 50 nt upstream of the N AUG codon (Fig. 6) .\n\nThe efficiency of PRF at the IBV ORF1a/ORF1b overlap in natural infection was found to be 33-40%. This range is in close agreement with previous in vitro measurements of IBV frameshifting efficiency carried out using reporter constructs (Brierley et al., 1989) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/612614 doi: bioRxiv preprint (Brierley and Pennell, 2001) . As also described for MHV-infected cells (Irigoyen et al., 2016) , there was no evidence that the frameshift-stimulatory pseudoknot induced ribosomal pausing on the slippery sequence. Thus pausing may not be a component of the frameshifting mechanism, or the pause may be too short-lived to be visualised by the profiling technique.\n\nA meta-analysis of host genes revealed highly specific phasing of the RiboSeq data sets, enabling the accurate determination of the reading frame of translation for individual RPFs. Good phasing in the datasets and substantial read depth also allowed us to examine translation of viral accessory ORFs. It was evident that both 4b and 4c are efficiently translated, at levels comparable to those of the 5a/5b accessory protein-encoding genes. The mechanism by which ribosomes might access ORF4c, however, is not clear. Given the absence of AUG codons within the regions between the 5\u2032 ends of ORF4b and ORF4c in both Beaudette and M41 (Supp. Fig. S9) , and the weak initiation context of the ORF4b start codon, it is possible that a proportion of ribosomes might bypass the ORF4b initiation codon and instead translate ORF4c via \"leaky scanning\" (Firth and Brierley, 2012) , although it should be noted that intervening AUG codons do exist in some other IBV strains (Supp. Fig. S9) .\n\nThe relevance to virus gene expression of the sites of significant ribosomal pausing identified in the genome remains to be investigated experimentally. Two of these pause sites appear to correspond to uORFs initiated at non-AUG initiation codons, one in the 5\u2032 UTR and one upstream of the N gene. In general, the pauses we discern during translation of the IBV genome are discrete, substantial in terms of read counts, and reproducible. As mentioned above, their origin is uncertain, but it seems unrelated to the identity of the P-site tRNA. Recent studies have shown that P-site prolyl-tRNA is a strong determinant of ribosomal pausing, partly due to the slow rate of peptide bond formation with this amino acid (Sabi and Tuller, 2015; . However, none of the stall sites identified here have proline tRNA in the P-site. One possible explanation we cannot rule out is that some feature of the nascent peptide engenders pausing through interactions with the ribosome exit tunnel or chaperones; clusters of positively-charged amino acid residues have been documented to induce ribosome pausing (Ingolia, 2014; Sabi and Tuller, 2017) , although such clusters are not evident upstream of the pause sites seen here. The recent developments of methodologies and algorithms to identify and characterise ribosomal pause sites may clarify the situation in future (Chadani et al., 2016; Kumari et al., 2018) . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/612614 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nOur data indicate that the host response to IBV is mediated primarily at the level of transcription, with the up-regulation of hundreds of genes, many of which have immune-related functions.\n\nChanges in translational efficiency were more modest, with more genes showing decreased rather than increased translation in response to IBV infection. Many of the transcriptionally upregulated genes identified reflect the host response to virus infection, as seen previously with IBV infection of chickens (Cong et al., 2013; Chhabra et al., 2018) \n\nThe apathogenic molecular clone of IBV, Beau-R, has been described previously (Casais et al., 2001) and was used to generate virus Beau-CK. The pathogenic isolate M41-CK has been described previously (Kottier et al., 1995) . Primary chick kidney (CK) cells were produced The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/612614 doi: bioRxiv preprint confluence (two days post-seeding) were washed once with PBS and infected with 9.6 \uf0b4 10 6 PFU Beau-CK or M41-CK. After 1 hour incubation at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 , the inoculum was removed and replaced with 10 ml fresh 1x BES (1X minimal essential Eagle's medium [MEM] , 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 20 mM N,N-Bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2aminoethanesulfonic acid (BES), 0.21% sodium bicarbonate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 250 U/ml nystatin, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 U/ml streptomycin). Cells were harvested at 24 hours postinfection when clear regions of cytopathic effect (CPE) were visible.\n\nDrug treatment, cell harvesting and lysis: Cycloheximide (CHX; Sigma-Aldrich) was added directly to the growth medium (to 100 \u00b5g/ml) and the cells incubated for 2 min at 37 \u00b0C before rinsing with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS containing CHX (100 \u00b5g/ml). Subsequently, dishes were incubated on ice and 400 \u00b5l of lysis buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 1% Triton X-100, 100 \u00b5g/ml cycloheximide and 25 U/ml TURBO\u2122 DNase (Life Technologies)] dripped onto the cells. The cells were scraped extensively to ensure lysis, collected and triturated with a 26-G needle ten times. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000 g at 4 \u00b0C, the supernatants recovered and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. \n\nAdaptor sequences were trimmed using FASTX-Toolkit (hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit), and reads shorter than 25 nt following adaptor trimming were discarded. Mapping was performed using Bowtie version 1 (Langmead et al., 2009 ) with parameters -v 2 --best (i.e. maximum 2 mismatches, report best match). Adaptor-trimmed, de-duplicated reads were mapped sequentially to host (Gallus The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/612614 doi: bioRxiv preprint positions of host mRNA reads relative to initiation and termination codons (Supp. Figs. 4 -7) were derived from reads mapping to RefSeq mRNAs with annotated CDSs at least 450 nt in length and annotated 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs at least 60 nt in length. When calculating the translation efficiencies of viral genes, only in-phase (i.e. phase 0 with respect to the ORF in question) RiboSeq reads were counted.\n\nFor host differential expression analyses, non-ribosomal, non-viral reads in each library were mapped to the Gallus gallus 5.0 assembly (December 2015) using STAR (Dobin et al., 2013) , with gene annotations from Ensembl release 94 (Cunningham et al., 2019) . A maximum of two mismatches were allowed when mapping. Read counts per gene (protein-coding genes only) were obtained using HTSeq (Anders et al., 2015) , with a requirement that reads map entirely within the forward strand coding sequence (htseq-count parameters: -m intersection-strict -s yes -t CDS). For each comparison of experimental groups, only genes with an average of at least 50 mapped reads were included in differential expression analyses. GO term enrichment analysis was carried out using the topGO package in R (Alexa and Rahnenfuhrer, 2018) and Fisher's exact test was used to assess the enrichment of individual GO terms in specific gene lists. Protein-protein interaction networks were constructed using the Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING) database (Szklarczyk et al., 2017) .

Alignment of IBV sequences, showing the positions of the ORF4b and ORF4c initiation codons (green). A 49-nt deletion in the Beaudette strain prematurely truncates the ORF4b gene by bringing a UAG codon (red) in frame. Note the absence of AUG codons between the starts of ORF4b and ORF4c in both IBV Beaudette and IBV M41, consistent with a leaky scanning mechanism for 4c expression. Conversely, the genome of the Belgian nephropathogenic strain B1648 contains an intervening AUG (underlined; 2-codon ORF) towards the 3\u2032 end of ORF4b. "}
