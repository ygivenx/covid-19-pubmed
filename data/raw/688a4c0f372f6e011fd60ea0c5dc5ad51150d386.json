However, we were able to successfully remove these drapes (by rolling them up) without further contamination of the area or the HCP. This was evidenced by the lack of fluorescent particles on visual inspection.\n\nOur series of experiments (each performed once) were proof-of-concept on the patterns of aerosolization and droplet sprays during extubation and the impact of clear drapes. We were to demonstrate that the use of low-cost barriers (clear plastic drapes) were able to significantly limit the aerosolization and droplet spray. Protection of frontline HCPs is paramount. However, PPE is a limited resource and often requires providers to be adaptive and resourceful in a crisis. The inexpensive and simple method of using clear drapes during extubation (and possibly intubation) of COVID-19 patients may be considered by frontline HCPs and infection control specialists as an additional precaution. Modifications of the clear plastics can be adapted for surgical procedures that may be AGMPs. Limitations of this work include its low-fidelity design and use of a larger particle (Glo-Germ) that may not reflect true spread of a virus like SARS-CoV-2. It is particularly important that HCPs take care not generate further aerosols during removal of the drapes; and recommend using the three-panel draping as opposed to the single drape technique.\n\nFurther studies will be needed to further refine this model and its findings. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20044404 doi: medRxiv preprint"}
