Combining PCR with serological testing enhances sensitivity. 6, 13, 14 Repeat testing, including repeating PCR on the same or additional samples, and pairwise serological testing to demonstrate a four-fold change between acute and convalescent titers, is also necessary to document infection in many cases.
