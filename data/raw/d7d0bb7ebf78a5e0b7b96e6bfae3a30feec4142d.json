{"title": "CD8 \u0609 T Cells and Macrophages Regulate Pathogenesis in a Mouse Model of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome", "body": "not accurately reproduce the authentic tissue-specific distribution and level of expression of endogenously expressed mDPP4 (reviewed in reference 24) . Accordingly, this model is characterized by robust MERS-CoV replication and rapid lethal disease characterized by inflammation in the lung and brain (23, 25) . However, significant brain pathology has not been observed in MERS-CoV infection in humans (10) .\n\nFinally, a recent study has demonstrated that mice transgenic for hDPP4 under the epithelial-cell-specific promoters also support widespread MERS-CoV infection resulting in significant damage in the lungs and brain of infected mice (26) . Although this model is improved relative to previously reported mouse models by limiting hDPP4 expression to epithelial cells, this is not coincident with the levels of expression and cell types in which endogenous mDPP4 is found.\n\nAll three models of MERS-CoV infection in mice (22, 25, 26) have robust replication of MERS-CoV and, as such, have utility as a vehicle for testing of novel therapeutics or vaccines that inhibit MERS-CoV replication (25, 26) . However, they provide limited information about the natural pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection in vivo (25) .\n\nWe have recently shown that a humanized knock-in mouse expressing hDPP4 in place of mDPP4 has detectable MERS-CoV replication with histological signs of MERS disease, and we used it to test the efficacy of a novel MERS-CoV monoclonal antibody therapeutic. This limited-duration study, up to 4 days postinfection, did not demonstrate significant clinical signs of MERS-CoV infection, e.g., weight loss (27) . In this study, we describe and characterize this novel mouse model for MERS-CoV infection in more detail. We find that from 5 to 7 days postinfection, MERS-CoV-infected mice display significant signs of clinical disease, including weight loss, ruffled fur, and labored breathing as well as significantly increased lung damage and inflammation. Analysis of lung inflammation in MERS-CoV-infected mice revealed alterations in the chemokine and cytokine response and leukocyte infiltration consistent with T cell-and macrophage-mediated responses. Transcriptome profiling corroborates these observations and suggests that there is also fibrotic gene upregulation, damage to the lung endothelium, and depletion of B cells in MERS-CoV-infected lungs. Using inflammatory cell depletion experiments, we further conclude that CD8 \u03e9 T cells exacerbate severe MERS-CoV lung disease while macrophages play a role in suppressing MERS-CoVinduced lung disease.\n\nhDPP4 tissue and immune cell distribution is the same as endogenous mDPP4 tissue distribution in C57B6/hDPP4 mice. When developing a mouse model expressing the human virus receptor, a major concern is ensuring correct tissue distribution of the protein. Endogenous DPP4 expression is not restricted to the lungs and also has a distinct tissue distribution, with some organs expressing higher levels than others (reviewed in reference 24). By maintaining the mDPP4 gene promoter and the 3= untranslated region (UTR) to control hDPP4 (27) , we aimed to achieve a model in which hDPP4 matched the tissue distribution and expression levels observed for endogenous mDPP4. To test this, we compared hDPP4 mRNA expression to mDPP4 mRNA expression in a range of organs and in blood.\n\nUsing genotype-confirmed hDPP4 \u03ea/\u03ea , hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03ea , and hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice, we assessed the expression levels of both mDPP4 and hDPP4 in mouse organs (Fig. 1A) . The levels of hDPP4 in both hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03ea and hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice are comparable to those of mDPP4 in hDPP4 \u03ea/\u03ea or hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03ea mice in seven of the eight tissues assayed (P \u03fe 0.05) (Fig. 1A) . The one significant discrepancy was in the kidney, where hDPP4 expression in hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03ea and hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice was significantly higher than mDPP4 expression in hDPP4 \u03ea/\u03ea or hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03ea mice; for example, hDPP4 in hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03ea compared to mDPP4 in hDPP4 \u03ea/\u03ea ; P \u03fd 0.001) (Fig. 1A) . We observed no significant difference in mDPP4 distribution in hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03ea mice compared to hDPP4 \u03ea/\u03ea mice in all organs (P \u03fe 0.05) (Fig. 1A) , suggesting that the replacement of mDPP4 with hDPP4 on one chromosome does not significantly affect endogenous mDPP4 expression.\n\nWe next assessed DPP4 expression on CD4 \u03e9 T cells, CD8 \u03e9 T cells, and macrophages (Fig. 1B) . As expected, in all cases, mDPP4 expression was detectable on cells isolated from hDPP4 \u03ea/\u03ea mice (Fig. 1B, first column, solid lines) , and hDPP4 expression was detectable on hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice (Fig. 1B, second column, dashed lines) . While it is difficult to quantifiably compare mDPP4 expression to that of hDPP4 due to different antibody affinities and fluorophores, there were detectable levels of mDPP4 and hDPP4 on hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03ea mice (Fig. 1B, spotted lines) . These data suggest that CD4 \u03e9 T cells, CD8 \u03e9 T cells, and macrophages from hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03ea mice express both mDPP4 and hDPP4.\n\nThese data show that the hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03ea and hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice do not have significantly different expression of hDPP4 compared to endogenous mDPP4, in terms of both tissue distribution and expression levels, although hDPP4 appears to be more highly expressed than mDPP4 in the kidney.\n\nhDPP4-expressing mice infected with MERS-CoV by intranasal inoculation display clinical signs of disease in a dose-dependent manner. We have previously shown that MERS-CoV infection in our C57B6 hDPP4-expressing mouse does not result in significant weight loss up to 4 days postinfection (27) . To determine if hDPP4expressing mice were susceptible to MERS-CoV disease at higher MERS-CoV doses and over a longer time course, we infected mice with 2.5 \u03eb 10 2 , 2.5 \u03eb 10 3 , or 2.5 \u03eb 10 4 PFU of MERS-CoV(Jordan) and monitored weight loss and clinical symptoms up to 21 days postinfection.\n\nFor the first 4 days of infection, there was no significant weight loss or clinical symptoms observed in any of the groups ( Fig. 2A) . However, starting from day 5 postinfection, mice infected with 2.5 \u03eb 10 4 PFU MERS-CoV(Jordan) lost significant weight, resulting in a \u054620% weight loss by day 7 postinfection in all mice ( Fig. 2A , diamonds). They also displayed progressively worsening clinical signs of disease from day 5 postinfection, such as ruffled fur, lethargy, and hunched bearing. Mice infected with an intermediate dose of 2.5 \u03eb 10 3 PFU MERS-CoV(Jordan) lost 10% of their starting body weight by day 7 postinfection but, interestingly, regained 5% of starting body weight by day 8 and remained at \u0546100% of starting body weight for the remainder of the time course from day 9 postinfection (Fig. 2A, triangles) . These mice displayed no other visible signs of disease at any other time point. Mock-infected mice ( Fig. 2A , circles) or mice infected with a low dose of 2.5 \u03eb 10 2 PFU MERS-CoV(Jordan) remained at \u0546100% of their starting body weight for the entire time course ( Fig. 2A, squares) and showed no visible signs of disease.\n\nThese data demonstrate that we have developed a useful model of MERS-CoV infection in which we can observe 3 distinct disease phenotypes based on the MERS-CoV inoculum: a lethal dose of MERS-CoV infection in mice (2.5 \u03eb 10 4 PFU/mouse), a dose at which mice show some symptoms but recover (2.5 \u03eb 10 3 PFU/mouse), and a dose at which there are no clinical symptoms of disease (2.5 \u03eb 10 2 PFU/mouse).\n\nMERS-CoV replicates efficiently in lungs of hDPP4-expressing mice. We have previously shown that MERS-CoV titers and RNA were detectable in the lungs of MERS-CoV-infected mice up to 4 days postinfection (27) . To extend these data and to confirm that mice infected with 2.5 \u03eb 10 2 , 2.5 \u03eb 10 3 , or 2.5 \u03eb 10 4 PFU were productively infected with MERS-CoV, we assessed MERS-CoV titers and RNA levels over a longer time course. As the mice infected with 2.5 \u03eb 10 4 PFU had all dropped below 80% of their starting body weight at 7 days postinfection and had to be sacrificed per IACUC regulations, there were no mice in this group for analysis at days 14 and 21 postinfection (Fig. 2B , C, and D, marked N/A). MERS-CoV titer was assayed by plaque assay on Vero cells, and MERS-CoV genomic RNA and mRNA levels were assayed by a TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay. Genomic RNA levels report on the amount of viral genome detected in the lungs, while the mRNA TaqMan primers detect only replicating virus by using a MERS-CoV Leader-specific primer as the 5= primer. The mRNA primers report the presence of mRNAs that are found only when MERS-CoV is replicating in cells. (Fig. 2D) were detected in all infected groups, though we did observe a dose-dependent decrease in MERS-CoV RNA levels at day 7 postinfection compared to day 4 postinfection for all doses ( Fig. 2C and D) . We suspect both that the TaqMan assay to detect RNA is more sensitive than plaque assay and that the viral RNA may be stable longer in the lungs than live virus. Using these assays, neither MERS-CoV (Fig. 2B ) nor MERS-CoV genomic RNA (Fig. 2C ) was detected at days 14 or 21 postinfection in mice infected with 2.5 \u03eb 10 2 or 2.5 \u03eb 10 3 PFU MERS-CoV except for the 2.5 \u03eb 10 2 group at day 14, in which we observe genomic RNA just above background levels. Low levels of MERS-CoV M mRNA, 3 log lower than the day 7 time point, were detectable at days 14 and 21 postinfection in mice infected with either 2.5 \u03eb 10 2 or 2.5 \u03eb 10 3 MERS-CoV (Fig. 2D) .\n\nThese data indicate that mice infected with all three doses of MERS-CoV had a productive MERS-CoV infection in the lungs and that the kinetics of infection was dose dependent.\n\nMERS-CoV does not spread to the brain, liver, or kidney but can be detected in the blood of hDPP4-expressing mice infected with 2.5 \u060b 10 4 PFU MERS-CoV. To determine if mice expressing hDPP4 under the endogenous mouse promoter displayed a disseminated pattern of MERS-CoV infection, we measured the levels of MERS-CoV RNA in the blood, brain, liver, kidney, and spleen of mice intranasally infected with 2.5 \u03eb 10 4 PFU MERS-CoV(Jordan) (Fig. 2E and F), as these mice had the highest levels of MERS-CoV replication in the lungs. We were unable to detect expression of either MERS-CoV genomic RNA or M mRNA in the brain, liver, or kidney of mice infected by MERS-CoV compared to mock-infected controls ( Fig. 2E and F). On the other hand, MERS-CoV genomic RNA and M mRNA were detectable in the blood of MERS-CoVinfected mice throughout the time course of infection (Fig. 2F ). In addition, we observed detectable amounts of MERS-CoV M mRNA, but not genomic RNA, in the spleen of the MERS-CoV-infected mice at all postinfection time points (Fig. 2F ). While MERS-CoV RNA was detectable in blood and spleen, both genomic and M mRNA levels in these tissues were many orders of magnitude lower than the levels measured in the lung.\n\nThese data suggest that MERS-CoV is present at a low level into the bloodstream of infected mice, either as free virions in the plasma or by infection of DPP4-expressing circulating leukocytes, which may traffic to the spleen. These data also demonstrate that MERS-CoV does not infect the brain, liver, or kidney over the time course of fatal infection in our C57B6/hDPP4 mice. Taken together, these data suggest that mortality of MERS-CoV in C57B6/hDPP4 mice is caused by the primary lung infection.\n\nInfection with MERS-CoV results in significant lung pathology characterized by vascular cuffing and lymphocyte influx. Mice infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV display distinct pathological effects within the lungs, characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and epithelial cell destruction (17) . We have previously described that lungs of mice expressing hDPP4 infected with MERS-CoV show significant interstitial inflammation with perivascular cuffing and extensive alveolar septal thickening (27) , but we did not observe any weight loss at day 4 postinfection. Based on the dose-dependent clinical disease and weight loss that we observed in the current study, we sought to further characterize the pathological effects of MERS-CoV. Examples of the types of pathology observed in MERS-CoV-infected mice are shown in Fig. 3 .\n\nMice infected with 2.5 \u03eb 10 2 PFU, 2.5 \u03eb 10 3 PFU, or 2.5 \u03eb 10 4 PFU MERS-CoV(Jordan) displayed various levels of lymphocytic perivascular inflammation, macrophage infiltration, pleuritis, and epithelial necrosis (Tables 1, 2, and 3). In the 2.5 \u03eb 10 2 -PFU MERS-CoV-infected mice, lymphocytic perivascular inflammation was still evident through day 21 postinfection while all other inflammatory parameters were resolved by day 14 postinfection (Table 1) . On the other hand, in mice infected with 2.5 \u03eb 10 3 PFU MERS-CoV, all pathological signs of disease, including lymphocytic perivascular inflammation, were resolved by day 14 postinfection (Table 2 ). In mice infected with 2.5 \u03eb 10 4 PFU MERS-CoV, no inflammatory resolution was observed by day 7 postinfection, and in addition, there was evidence of moderate edema (Table 3) .\n\nOverall, these data suggest that MERS-CoV infection of hDPP4-expressing mice causes a dose-dependent inflammatory disease characterized by predominantly perivascular inflammation that consists of mostly macrophages and lymphocytes.\n\nTranscriptome analysis of MERS-CoV-infected B6/hDPP4 mice demonstrates recruitment and activation of T cells and macrophages. Compared to the lower doses tested, mice infected with 2.5 \u03eb 10 4 PFU MERS-CoV display the most severe MERS-CoV infection phenotype; therefore, we decided to characterize the inflammatory response in C57B6/hDPP4 mice infected with 2.5 \u03eb 10 4 PFU of MERS-CoV by transcriptome analysis of infected lungs. Lungs from C57B6/hDPP4 mice infected with 2.5 \u03eb 10 4 PFU MERS-CoV(Jordan) were analyzed by strand-specific RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) for transcriptional changes compared to lungs from mock-infected mice. We found a substantially altered lung transcriptional profile that correlates with the histological data in Fig. 2 .\n\nAt day 2 postinfection, we detected 1,900 genes with expression altered by at least 50% compared to mock-infected controls. By 4 days postinfection, 2,484 genes were differentially regulated, and by day 7 postinfection, 5,536 genes, or about one-quarter of the mouse genome, was perturbed. The most pronounced changes were observed in genes associated with the inflammatory response. As early as day 2 postinfection, multiple cytokines and chemokines associated with both Th1 and Th2 responses were dramatically upregulated in infected lungs compared to mock-infected controls, including Cxcl11 (252-fold increase), Cxcl10 (222-fold), and others (Ccl7, Cxcl9, Ccl12, Ccl2) ( Fig. 4B ; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material for a full list of gene changes). All these genes retain their markedly elevated expression levels through day 7 postinfection, when the mice had to be sacrificed due to \u054620% weight loss.\n\nUnsupervised hierarchical clustering allowed for further classification of these gene changes. The set of genes perturbed at day 7 postinfection compared to mock-infected controls fell roughly into four categories (Fig. 4A) . The cytokines noted above clustered together into one group (shown in red on the heatmap in Fig. 4A ). Members of this \n\nMean disease score at dpi:\n\nLung sections from 5 MERS-CoV-infected mice per group were scored for pathological signs of disease on a scale of 0 to 5, and scores were averaged and rounded to the nearest whole number: \u03e9, 0 or 1; \u03e9\u03e9, 2 or 3; \u03e9\u03e9\u03e9, 4 or 5; dpi, days postinfection.\n\ngroup showed sharply elevated expression by day 2 postinfection (the first time point assayed) and continued to be overexpressed throughout the time course. A large number of cytokines, interleukins, and interferons follow this pattern of expression; for example, gamma interferon was 40-fold upregulated compared to mock-infected controls by day 7 postinfection, and Timp1, Serpine1, Thbs1, and other genes associated with fibrosis were also significantly upregulated (Fig. 4B ). The second cluster (Fig. 4A , orange) shows a more gradual pattern, with expression increasing over the time course of infection or only at day 7. Many genes in this category were associated with cell adhesion and wound-healing functions. Thus, while genes in the red group signify the acute phase of fibrosis, those in this orange group (e.g., Col3a1 and other collagens, Tgfb1) were associated with more-established disease. Proteasome components are also highly enriched in this group, with expression peaking at day 7 postinfection (Fig. 4B , brown lines). The largest category derived from unsupervised clustering (Fig. 4A, cyan) showed the inverse pattern, with expression diminishing toward the later time points of infection. Functional groups enriched for genes within this category included angiogenesis (Vegfa, Dll4), the Notch pathway (Hey1, Hes1, and Nrarp), and endothelial markers (Robo4, Pecam1) (cyan, aqua, and light blue lines in Fig. 4B) .\n\nThe upregulated cytokines suggest T cell and macrophage recruitment upon infection with MERS-CoV. For example, both Cxcl11 and Cxcl10 are chemokines that promote T cell migration. To investigate further, we used a panel of genes showing cell-type-specific expression, as derived by the Immgen consortium (28) , to assess immune subtype changes. We observed a sudden increase in T cell markers such as Cd3e and Themis by day 7, though not before (Fig. 4B, magenta lines) . Thus, there is a pronounced delay between elevated cytokine expression and recruitment of T cells. Genes associated with macrophage proliferation were significantly upregulated upon MERS-CoV infection, with C1qc and C1qa levels increasing 2-fold by day 2 compared to mock-infected controls and reaching over 6-fold by day 7 (Fig. 4B, pale red lines) . In contrast, there was significant downregulation of B cell markers (Cd19, Cd79a) at day 2 postinfection, compared to mock-infected controls, with continued reduction over the remainder of the time course (Fig. 4B , dark blue lines). B cell-associated genes are the only cluster whose members showed diminishing expression levels over the entire time course of MERS-CoV infection (Fig. 4B, blue) . The dendritic cell marker Fscn1 was modestly upregulated at days 4 and 7 postinfection, while NK cell markers (Itga2, Ncr1) were unchanged.\n\nLastly, we asked whether the set of gene changes observed in our experiment resembled any in the public domain. To this end, we used NextBio, which compares pairs of gene signatures based on a running Fisher test-based algorithm (29) . From among the 18,125 experiments in NextBio's database of public studies, the top four experiments matching the gene signature obtained from MERS-CoV-infected lungs at day 7 were all analogous to experiments in which SARS-CoV-infected mouse lungs (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). These results confirm the shared biology underpinning the host response to coronavirus infection. Our MERS-CoV infection signature also strongly matched other viral infections of the lung, for example, influenza virus H1N1 and bleomycin-treated lungs (Table S2) .\n\nLungs of hDPP4 mice infected with MERS-CoV are infiltrated with macrophages, neutrophils, and both CD4 \u0609 and CD8 \u0609 T cells over the course of infection.\n\nTo validate the results of the RNA-Seq analysis and histological observations, we next quantified the specific leukocyte populations present in the lungs of hDPP4-expressing mice infected with 2.5 \u03eb 10 4 PFU MERS-CoV over the time course of infection. We used flow cytometry to specifically identify subsets of lymphocytes (B cells, NK cells, CD4 \u03e9 T cells, and CD8 \u03e9 T cells), antigen-presenting cells (APCs; dendritic cells [DCs] and macrophages), and granulocytes (basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils). At 2 days postinfection, there is no significant difference in lung leukocyte populations in MERS-CoV-infected mice compared to mock-infected controls (P \u03fe 0.05 for all cell types) (Fig.  5A) . However, by 4 days postinfection, macrophage levels were significantly increased (6-\u03ee 2.8-fold higher; P \u03fd 0.001) (Fig. 5B ) and remained significantly elevated at day 7 postinfection (P \u03fd 0.001) (Fig. 5C ). Neutrophils also increased at day 4 (3.2-\u03ee 0.8-fold; P \u03fd 0.05), although there was no significant difference in neutrophil numbers compared to mock-infected controls at day 7 postinfection (P \u03fe 0.05) (Fig. 5C ). Both CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cell numbers significantly increased 4-fold at day 7 postinfection compared to mock-infected controls (P \u03fd 0.001 in both cases) (Fig. 5C) . Numbers of B cells, NK cells, DCs, basophils, and eosinophils in the lungs were not significantly affected by MERS-CoV infection at any time point compared to mock-infected controls (Fig. 5A , B, and C) (P \u03fe 0.05 in all cases). When data are plotted respective to the mock-infected controls (Fig. 5D) , clear increases of CD4 \u03e9 T cells, CD8 \u03e9 T cells, and macrophages can be observed over the time course of MERS-CoV lung infection.\n\nThese data suggest that MERS-CoV infection induces the influx of macrophages, neutrophils, and CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells into the lungs of infected mice in a time-dependent manner. Neutrophils infiltrate up to 4 days postinfection but then return to background levels for the remainder of the infection. CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells infiltrate after day 4 postinfection and reach very high levels by 7 days postinfection, whereas macrophages infiltrate the lungs of infected mice from day 4 postinfection and are still at high levels at 7 days postinfection. The infiltration of macrophages and T cells shows remarkable concordance with the transcriptome profiling observations, both in the magnitude and kinetics of the changes.\n\nC57B6/hDPP4 mice. Taken together, the histology, flow cytometry, RNA-Seq, and cytokine and chemokine data suggest that MERS-CoV disease in mice is characterized by a large influx of T cells into the lungs of infected mice. However, as both CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells are present in higher numbers in MERS-CoV-infected mice, the relative contributions of each cell type to pathogenesis cannot be determined from these data. Therefore, we specifically depleted either CD4 \u03e9 or CD8 \u03e9 T cells from the lungs of mice expressing hDPP4 to determine the relative roles of T cell subtypes in MERS-CoVmediated disease. (Table 4 ). There was also no statistically significant effect of CD4 \u03e9 T cell depletion on the MERS-CoVdependent weight loss (P \u03fe 0.05) (Fig. 6A ) or on the MERS-CoV titer in the lungs of infected mice at day 4 or 7 postinfection (P \u03fe 0.05) (Fig. 6B) . These data suggest that CD4 \u03e9 T cells do not contribute to MERS-CoV replication, persistence, or pathogenesis in vivo.\n\nIn contrast, depleting CD8 \u03e9 T cells slightly exacerbated MERS-CoV-induced overall inflammation, bronchiolar inflammation, lymphocyte infiltration, and pleuritis at day 7 postinfection (Table 5) , as assessed by histology. No significant changes in lung pathology were observed at day 4 postinfection. Interestingly, despite the mildly worse inflammation observed at day 7, depletion of CD8 \u03e9 T cells significantly protected against MERS-CoV-dependent weight loss at days 6 and 7 postinfection (Fig. 6C , squares). For example, at day 7 postinfection MERS-infected mice treated with control antibody dropped to 83.5% \u03ee 0.75% of their starting weight, whereas CD8 \u03e9 T celldepleted mice were at 93.5% \u03ee 2.1% of starting weight (P \u03fd 0.001). Depletion of CD8 \u03e9 T cells had no significant effect on the MERS-CoV titer in the lungs of infected mice at day 4 or 7 postinfection (P \u03fe 0.05) (Fig. 6D) . These data suggest that CD8 \u03e9 T cells contribute to MERS-CoV-induced lung pathology but do not contribute to the replication, persistence, or control of MERS-CoV in vivo.\n\nThe data suggest that MERS-CoV disease induces infiltration of macrophages into the lungs of infected mice and also an increase in macrophage activation. We determined the role of macrophages in MERS-CoV infection in hDPP4-expressing mice by depleting macrophages from the lungs of mice using clodronate-containing liposomes.\n\nDepletion of macrophages resulted in no significant changes in pathology at 4 days postinfection compared to treatment with control (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) liposomes, except for slightly increased lymphocyte infiltration (Table 6 ). However, depletion of macrophages did appear to make MERS-CoV-induced overall inflammation, perivascular inflammation, edema, eosinophilia, and lymphocyte infiltration worse at day 7 postinfection than in mock-infected control mice (Table 6 ). Furthermore, depletion of macrophages from the lungs of hDPP4 mice caused significantly greater weight loss at days 6 and 7 postinfection than in controls (Fig. 6E, squares) . For example, at day 7 postinfection, MERS-CoV-infected mice treated with PBS-containing liposomes were at 86.8% \u03ee 1.2% of starting weight, whereas mice treated with clodronate-containing liposomes were at 82% \u03ee 0.9% of starting weight (P \u03fd 0.05). As we observed with T cells, macrophage depletion had no significant effect on MERS-CoV titers in the lungs of infected mice at day 4 or 7 postinfection (Fig. 6F ) (P \u03fe 0.05). These data suggest that macrophages protect mice from MERS-CoV-dependent lung inflammation but do not promote or inhibit MERS-CoV replication in vivo.\n\nMERS-CoV is an emerging highly pathogenic coronavirus for which there are no approved treatments or vaccination strategies. In order to develop novel MERS-CoV therapeutics, a well-characterized small-animal model that reproduces the disease seen in humans is required for the early-stage testing of putative therapies in vivo. In this study, we further characterize a mouse model of MERS-CoV that we have previously used to test a novel MERS-CoV therapeutic strategy (27) .\n\nHistology data from a MERS-CoV-infected human patient demonstrated that infection is manifested by severe inflammatory lung pathology (10) . Previously described mouse models for MERS-CoV infection do not exhibit these traits and thus do not accurately reflect human disease. Here we showed that in humanized mice, hDPP4 expression by organ and immune cell type was equivalent to endogenous mDPP4 expression. Further, we show that infection of hDPP4-expressing mice with different doses of MERS-CoV yields three different disease phenotypes: 2.5 \u03eb 10 4 PFU MERS-CoV causes a 20% weight loss from day 5 to day 7 postinfection; 2.5 \u03eb 10 3 PFU MERS-CoV causes a 10% weight loss by day 7 postinfection, from which the mice recover; and 2.5 \u03eb 10 2 PFU MERS-CoV has no effect on the weight of mice. This is despite the finding that infectious MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV RNA can be recovered from the lungs of mice infected with all three doses, though levels depend on the inoculated dose. All infected mice were clear, or almost clear, of infectious MERS-CoV in the lungs by day 7 postinfection. Interestingly, in mice that survived past 7 days postinfection, MERS-CoV mRNA was still detectable at 21 days postinfection, albeit at much lower levels than at the peak of infection, and there was no evidence of MERS-CoV genomic RNA in the lungs of infected mice at this time point. We hypothesize that the detection of MERS-CoV mRNA at this late time point is due to either inherent differences in levels of detection by plaque assays and by qPCR or to the fact that there is a substantial presence of viral RNA that is maintained in a cell population in the lungs after the virus is cleared. Whether this RNA is able to produce live virus at extended time points or potentially under immune cell depletion conditions is unknown. Experiments comparing viral RNA levels and depletion experiments during longer infection times will be analyzed in the future. Studies have shown that MERS-CoV is capable of spreading to other organs in infected mice when DPP4 is expressed under a strong ubiquitous promoter (23, 25) . The recent human case report suggests that MERS-CoV does not spread to any other organ during human infection (10) , and we could find no evidence of MERS-CoV spread to the brain, kidney, or liver in C57B6/hDPP4 mice that were exposed to our highest dose of MERS-CoV and succumbed to fatal infection. We detected small amounts of MERS-CoV RNA in the blood and spleen of infected mice, suggesting that MERS-CoV is present in the blood or a circulating cell, such as T cells (6), but the clinical significance of this is unclear. There are only minimal data for the blood titer or immune cell infections in vivo in human infections. We hypothesize that the immune cell component of MERS-CoV pathogenesis may provide legitimate models of infection in vivo, for example, in circulating T cells. Without additional human MERS-CoV data, it is difficult to know for certain; however, the role of the immune cell component in MERS-CoV pathogenesis and replication is an active area of research in the B6/hDPP4 mouse model.\n\nHistological analysis of the lungs of MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4 mice reveals that MERS-CoV causes significant edema, vascular cuffing, and alveolar septum thickening caused by lymphocyte infiltration. This recapitulates the basic pathology observed in human lungs after severe MERS-CoV infection (10) . The decrease in angiogenesisrelated and endothelial marker gene expression in our RNA-Seq data is also consistent with the vascular damage observed in the human autopsy study (10) . Although the autopsy of this patient describes only cardiac fibrosis, our data show transcriptional changes consistent with fibrosis in the lung, as collagens, Timp1, and transforming growth factor \u2424 (TGF-\u2424) are upregulated, and the set of infection-induced gene changes shows strong concordance with those seen in bleomycin-induced fibrosis models.\n\nWe have also analyzed infiltrating cell populations by flow cytometry and found significant infiltration of CD4 \u03e9 T cells, CD8 \u03e9 T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils into the lungs over the time course of MERS-CoV infection of our hDPP4 mice. RNA-Seq identified a significant transcriptional upregulation of T cell chemokines, such as Cxcl10 and Ccl12, of T cell-associated factors, such as Ccl1, and of factors produced by macrophages, such as Ccl3 and Ccl4. The cellular sources of these cytokine and chemokine transcripts are under investigation, but in light of previous studies (7, 8) , macrophages may be a significant source of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during MERS-CoV infection, regardless of whether they do (8) or do not (7) facilitate productive MERS-CoV replication. The role of macrophages and monocytes in human disease is unknown due to the minimal clinical data from MERS patients. The analysis of MERS-CoV replication or the role of murine macrophages compared to that of human macrophages in pathogenesis in vivo is difficult due to the lack of human samples. However, the B6/hDPP4 mouse model can be used to answer the question of how murine monocytes and macrophages respond to MERS-CoV infection and affect disease. We hypothesize that they play an important role in MERS-CoV lung pathology and in the immune response to infection; however, additional experiments are needed to discern the mechanism by which this occurs.\n\nTaken together, our data suggested a strong T cell and macrophage response in the lungs of MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4 mice, so we depleted mice of T cells and macrophages to determine their roles, if any, in MERS-CoV pathogenesis. We found that CD4 \u03e9 T cells have no effect on MERS-CoV-induced pathology, replication, or persistence in the lungs of infected mice.\n\nInterestingly, depletion of CD8 \u03e9 T cells improved the physical symptoms of mice infected with MERS-CoV without inhibiting MERS-CoV replication or reducing the pathological signs of disease in the lungs of infected hDPP4 mice, suggesting that CD8 \u03e9 T cells may contribute to MERS-CoV-induced weight loss in infected mice. Our data suggest that this is not due to the physical presence of large numbers of CD8 \u03e9 T cells blocking gas exchange, as pathology scores reveal, if anything, more lymphocytes in the lungs of CD8 \u03e9 T cell-depleted mice. Previous studies have shown that there is no difference between CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cells in terms of permissiveness to MERS-CoV infection and that MERS-CoV causes T cell apoptosis in mixed T cell cultures (6) . Therefore, we hypothesize that there is a unique response of CD8 \u03e9 T cells to MERS-CoV infection that is responsible for the physical symptoms of disease. These responses could include the specific timing and sensitivity of CD8 \u03e9 T cell to apoptosis or the production of a cytokine/chemokine that causes more-systemic inflammatory symptoms.\n\nWe found that depletion of macrophages exacerbated the physical symptoms and pathological signs of disease in the lungs of MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4 mice without affecting MERS-CoV replication, suggesting that macrophages protect against MERS-CoV-mediated disease. The mechanism of action is under investigation, but one possibility is that macrophages produce a cytokine/chemokine that protects the lung from excessive inflammation. This is intriguing because previous work on the SARS-CoV demonstrated that macrophages in the lungs of mice were detrimental to lung pathology and clearance of SARS-CoV by inhibiting efficient T cell responses (30) . Investigation of the differences between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in this context may reveal crucial host responses that determine how macrophages respond differently to these highly pathogenic coronaviruses.\n\nA previous study using the adenovirus transduction of hDPP4 into the lungs of mice suggested that T cells play an important role in the clearance of MERS-CoV (22) . In that study, MERS-CoV was not cleared from mice that genetically lack all T cells (TCRa \u03ea/\u03ea ) but was cleared at levels similar to those of wild-type mice in mice lacking B cells (uMT \u03ea/\u03ea ). We found that antibody-based depletion of CD4 \u03e9 or CD8 \u03e9 T cells in adult mice had no significant effect on MERS-CoV titers in the lungs of infected mice, suggesting that in our mouse model with depletion, neither subtype alone plays a significant role in the clearance of MERS-CoV. There are marked differences between these two mouse models that could be responsible for the differences in results. First, the Ad/hDPP4 model transduces hDPP4 into any cells that the adenovirus can infect in the lungs, not necessarily the cells that natively express hDPP4. In addition, the expression levels of hDPP4 in the Ad/hDPP4 model vary from the endogenous hDPP4 levels seen in the B6/hDPP4 mice in this study. The MERS-CoV inoculum may also be responsible for the differences, since the inoculum used in this study was one that caused high levels of infection, lung pathology, and clinical disease, which could be overwhelming to the immune response and mask small differences in MERS-CoV replication that may have a much more significant effect on MERS-CoV when the initial inoculum is lower. Finally, the depletion experiments do not result in a total lack of either T cell-type in the lungs, in contrast to the complete knockout mouse experiments in the study by Zhao et al. (22) . Therefore, we cannot rule out that there may be a role for T and B cells in the control of viral load for MERS-CoV that was not observed using our current experimental approaches. Comparisons of viral dose, cell depletions, and background differences between the two models would be informative in the future.\n\nOverall, we have utilized a human DPP4-expressing mouse to create a model of MERS-CoV pathogenesis. In this model, we have demonstrated that CD8 \u03e9 T cells and macrophages influence the course of MERS-CoV-induced disease. This model will allow for the analysis of how individual inflammatory cell types and host-produced factors regulate MERS-CoV pathogenesis. Vero E6 cells (monkey kidney epithelial cells, ATCC CRL-1586) for plaque assays were grown in minimal essential media (MEM; Corning) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich), 1% (vol/vol) L-glutamine (Gibco), and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-streptomycin (Gemini bioproducts) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere.\n\nHuman DPP4 (hDPP4)-expressing C57B6 mice (C57B6/hDPP4 mice) were created and provided by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. as described previously (27) . Mice that were heterozygous for hDPP4 were bred at the University of Maryland School of Medicine by crossing hDPP4 homozygotes with mDPP4 homozygotes.\n\nMouse genotyping and human and mouse DPP4 quantification by TaqMan assay. Eight-to 12-week-old C57/B6 mice were genotyped using the Extract-N-Amp Tissue PCR kit (Sigma-Aldrich) on tail clips according to the manufacturers' instructions. PCR for both mDPP4 and hDPP4 was performed using a common forward primer (CTGGCTTAGATCTCTGGCGT), an mDPP4 reverse primer (ATTGGCACGGTGAT GATGGTG), and an hDPP4 reverse primer (TAAGACGGAGCCTGACCTGA). PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel and assigned as wild type for mDPP4 expression (hDPP4 \u03ea/\u03ea ) or as heterozygote (hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03ea ) or homozygote (hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03e9 ) for hDPP4 expression based on band migration.\n\nEight-to 12-week-old C57/B6 mice were euthanized using isoflurane (Butler Animal Health Supply), and the following organs were harvested: brain, heart, intestine (small), lung, liver, kidney, and spleen. Blood was obtained by dissection of the aorta in the thoracic cavity, allowing the blood to pool in the thoracic cavity, and removed by pipette.\n\nAll organs were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Ambion) using 1.0-mm glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and a MagNA lyser (Roche). RNA was extracted using Direct-zol RNA miniprep (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human and mouse DPP4 mRNA expression was quantified using the Fast 1-step PCR mix (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions with specific TaqMan gene expression assays for hDPP4 and mDPP4 (Applied Biosystems).\n\nThreshold cycle (C T ) values were assessed and analyzed using a 7500 Fast Dx PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems), and relative DPP4 expression levels were determined using the \u0394\u0394C T method, comparing to hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03e9 for mDPP4 expression and hDPP4 \u03ea/\u03ea for hDPP4 expression.\n\nMouse infections. Eight-to 12-week-old C57/B6 mice heterozygote for hDPP4 (hDPP4 \u03e9/\u03ea ) were used in all MERS-CoV infection experiments. Prior to intranasal inoculation, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection using a mix of xylazine (0.38 mg/mouse) and ketamine (1.3 mg/mouse) diluted in PBS to make a total volume of 50 l per mouse. Once anesthetized, mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS or 2.5 \u03eb 10 2 PFU, 2.5 \u03eb 10 3 PFU, or 2.5 \u03eb 10 4 PFU of MERS-CoV(Jordan) diluted into PBS for a 50-l total inoculum. During the experiments, mice were weighed on the day of infection and every day of the experiment to assess MERS-CoV-induced weight loss.\n\nAt noted time points postinfection, or when mice reached \u054580% of their starting body weight, mice were euthanized using isoflurane (Butler Animal Health Supply). Lungs and, for some experiments, kidneys, brains, blood, and liver were harvested for analysis of MERS-CoV replication and pathology.\n\nMERS-CoV quantification. For live MERS-CoV titers, organs from infected mice where homogenized in PBS (Quality Biological Inc.) using 1.0-mm glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and a beadruptor (Omni International Inc.). MERS-CoV titers in PFU per milliliter were determined by plaque assay as previously described (31) and then converted to PFU/gram of lung based on the mass of the harvested lung.\n\nFor MERS-CoV genomic RNA and M mRNA quantification, organs from infected mice were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Ambion) using 1.0-mm glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich) and a beadruptor (Omni International Inc.). RNA was extracted using the Direct-zol RNA miniprep kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Levels of MERS-CoV genomic RNA and M mRNA were determined using the Fast 1-step PCR mix (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions with previously described specific primers and probes targeting UpE for MERS-CoV genomic RNA and the membrane (M) protein mRNA (Life Technologies [31] ). Mouse transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFRC) was used as the endogenous control and was detected using the following primers and probe: forward primer, ATGACGTTGAATTGAACCTGGACTA; reverse primer, GTCTCCACGAGCGGAATACAG; probe, ABY-A TCAGGGATATGGGTCTAAGTCTACAGTGG-QSY. C T values were determined using a 7500 Fast Dx PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems), and relative MERS-CoV mRNA expression levels were determined using the \u0394\u0394C T method with comparison to mock-infected controls. All \u0394\u0394C T values of \u03fd1 were corrected to equal 1.\n\nHistology. Paraformaldehyde-fixed lungs were embedded in paraffin and sectioned before hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining by the Pathology Electron Microscopy and Histology Laboratory at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Slides were blindly scored for pathological signs of disease on a scale of 0 to 5 by Sarah Beck at the Department of Molecular and Comparative Pathobiology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Scored categories are for bronchiolar inflammation, perivascular inflammation, edema, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, pleuritis, and epithelial necrosis. The Statistics. Data for TaqMan assays, MERS-CoV quantitation, and flow cytometry analyses are presented as means \u03ee standard errors of the means (SEM) and were analyzed using a Student t test or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Bonferroni posttest, as appropriate. Statistical significance was obtained when P values were \u03fd0.05.\n\nSupplemental material for this article may be found at https://doi.org/10.1128/ JVI.01825-16.\n\nDATASET S1, XLS file, 1.0 MB.
