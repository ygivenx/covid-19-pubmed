{"title": "Intranasal immunization with Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv3615c induces sustained adaptive CD4+ T\u2010cell and antibody responses in the respiratory tract", "body": "Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases worldwide, accounting for 10.4 million new cases and 1.5 million mortalities annually.1 Vaccination with Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette\u2010Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) has made a marked contribution to the control of M.tb infection, especially in juvenile and newborns. However, BCG does not provide adequate protection for all age groups, particularly in adults.2 With the constant emergence of multidrug\u2010resistant strains, prevention of M.tb infection is the most promising and cost\u2010effective approach to reducing the TB epidemic.3 Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of an effective vaccination strategy to protect against M.tb infections.\n\nVaccination primes antigen\u2010specific precursors, and induces their expansion and differentiation into memory cells. When these memory cells re\u2010encounter a cognate antigen, they mount a robust and rapid response to control the infection at early stage.4 In the case of a M.tb infection, there are more CD4+ T cells than CD8+ T cells at the sites of infection, and the CD4+ T cells have been shown to play multiple roles in initiating and propagating the T\u2010cell responses in animal models and human cases.5, 6 CD4+ T cells with effector or effector\u2013memory phenotype played a major role in controlling the mycobacteria at site of infection and limited progression of the disease.7 Some of them had a phenotype of CD44+CD62Llow,8 and produced Th1\u2010type cytokines, such as IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and IL\u20102. These effector cytokines eliminated the infected cells and controlled M.tb replication.9, 10 Thus, many vaccine developments have been focused on identifying new CD4+ T\u2010cell epitopes inducing Th1\u2010type responses, or modifying BCG to improve efficacy for providing a broader protection.11, 12 Among them, ESAT\u20106 and CFP\u201010, which induce dominant Th1\u2010type CD4+ T\u2010cell responses, have been evaluated and shown potentially protective effects. The ESAT\u20106, formatted as an ESAT\u20106\u2010Ag85 fusion protein, promoted strong and long\u2010lived M.tb\u2010specific T\u2010cell responses in na\u00efve human volunteers13, 14; the CFP\u201010, previously used for disease diagnosis, could induce IFN\u2010\u03b3 release and reduce IL\u20104 secretion of CD4+ T cells, as well as promote antibody response with an enhanced IgG2a/IgG1 ratio in mice.15 Although the evaluation is ongoing, establishment of adaptive Th1\u2010type CD4+ T\u2010cell response with effector or effector\u2013memory phenotype is one of the targets for vaccine development to prevent TB.\n\nInduction of only Th1\u2010type memory responses did not sufficiently eliminate M.tb, nor did it efficiently protect the host; the location of vaccine\u2010primed memory cells also had an impact on the efficiency of protection.16, 17 Limited success of TB vaccine trials might simply be due to failure to elicit, maintain, and/or deliver sufficient effector\u2013functional T cells to the respiratory tract.18, 19 A population of T cells that reside in peripheral tissues has been recently identified as tissue\u2010resident memory T cells (TRM).20, 21 They are at the frontline, encountering pathogen invasions, and are antigen\u2010experienced memory cells. They can expand rapidly in response to cognate antigens to establish a barrier that limits the infection of target cells without the time\u2010consuming procedure of recruiting effector cells from lymphoid tissues and the circulation.22 Intranasal immunization induces not only systemic but also airway mucosal immune responses, while subcutaneous immunization preferably elicits responses in the serum and peripheral lymphoid tissues.23 Intranasal immunization with BCG preferably induced TB\u2010specific CD4+ T cells in the lung tissue,7 and lung tissue CD4+ memory T cells\u2010mediated adaptive immunity against Bordetella pertussis and Coronavirus infections efficiently.24, 25, 26 The route of immunization has an impact on the location and differentiation of vaccination\u2010primed cells, and intranasal immunization has being tested as a promising approach to induce mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract for prevention of M.tb, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and other pathogenic infections.11, 13, 26, 27, 28\n\n\nThe escalating magnitude of T\u2010cell response and IFN\u2010\u03b3 production induced by BCG did not provide additional protection against M.tb infection.18 In search for new TB vaccine candidates, we evaluated Rv3615c, a protein whose secretion is dependent on a component of RD1, for potency of inducing T\u2010cell responses of patients with tuberculosis pleurisy.9 Rv3615c has previously been identified as an ESX\u20101 substrate protein C (EspC) and has been known as a protein with similar amino acid length and homologous sequence as ESAT\u20106, CFP\u201010, and other members of the ESAT\u20106 family.29, 30 The encoding region for Rv3615c is out of RD1 but its secretion is controlled by the ESAT\u20106 secretion system.31 Although not expressed in BCG, Rv3615c is actively expressed and accessible to the antigen\u2010presenting process during intracellular M.tb infections in vivo.32, 33 In a mouse model, subcutaneous immunization with recombinant protein containing Rv3615c promoted Th1\u2010type cytokine productions in the spleen, and both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were responsible for the elevated cytokine productions, and a portion of them coexpressed multiple cytokines.34 In human cases, Rv3615c or its overlapping peptides elicited PBMCs isolated from patients with active TB or latent TB infection (LTBI) to produce IFN\u2010\u03b3, with a portion of them coproducing IL\u20102.35 Rv3615 has been shown to contain multiple epitopes of human T cells, many of them induce predominately CD4+ T\u2010cell responses, with only a few of them inducing weak CD8+ T\u2010cell responses. Although the protection induced by subcutaneous immunization with Rv3615c was modest to virulent M.tb challenge, these data suggest the potential of Rv3615c as a vaccine candidate for inducing adaptive immunity beyond those elicited by BCG. Following previous studies, here, we use mouse model to explore if immunization with Rv3615c intranasally promotes sustained memory CD4+ T\u2010cell response in airway compartment locally, and to examine the profile of T\u2010cell response by comparing with those induced by subcutaneous immunization. Our study can provide information for rational design and inoculation route of a TB vaccine.\n\nFemale C57BL/6 mice aged 6\u20108 weeks were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Center of Sun Yat\u2010Sen University (S.C. XK 2016\u20100029) and maintained under pathogen\u2010free conditions. Mice were age\u2010 and weight\u2010matched in each experiment. All animal studies were approved by the Zhongshan School of Experimental Animal Ethics Committee, Sun Yat\u2010Sen University, Guangzhou, China.\n\nThe Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) Rv3615c (Esx\u20101 substrate protein C, EspC) protein and its peptide array, and CpG ODN 1826 were purchased from Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China) with customized synthesis. The peptide array comprises 19 peptides spanning the entire region of the Rv3615c sequence, with each having 15 mers and overlapping by 11 amino acids. The immunization protocol was previously reported.36 Briefly, 10 \u03bcg Rv3615c/mouse was mixed with or without 20 \u03bcg CpG ODN 1826/mouse. For subcutaneous immunization, the mixture was suspended in PBS and injected twice into the lower quadrant of the abdomen (200 \u03bcL/mouse). For intranasal immunization, the mixture was suspended in PBS and injected intranasally through the nasal cavity while the mice were anaesthetized with bromethane (20 \u03bcL/mouse). A detail schedule of prime and boost is shown in Figure 1.\n\nTo distinguish cells in lung parenchyma (LP) from lung vasculature (LV), we used a protocol previously reported to label cells in circulation in vivo.37 In short, anti\u2010CD45\u2010phycoerythrin (clone 30\u2010F11, BD Bioscience) was diluted to 10 \u03bcg/mL in sterile PBS and injected into mice via the tail vein in a volume of 300 \u03bcL/mouse. The mice were killed 5 min later, and mononuclear cells were isolated from tissues for experiments. Cells labelled with anti\u2010CD45 were identified as in LV, and its counterpart was identified as in LP in flow cytometry data analysis.\n\nBlood was obtained through retro\u2010orbital bleeding, and the serum was prepared following a standard procedure. Lung tissues were mechanically dissociated into 1\u20102 mm3 pieces, then transferred to a culture dish containing 2 mL RPMI 1640, 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mg/mL collagenase IV, and 10 mg/mL DNase I (Sigma\u2010Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C in a shaker. Spleen, mesenteric, and inguinal lymph node (LN) tissues were mechanically disrupted and filtered through a 40 \u03bcm cell\u2010strainer (Falcon, Durham, NC, USA). Cell preparations from lung, spleen, and LN tissues were treated with red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer, washed twice in complete RPMI 1640 medium, and loaded onto Ficoll\u2010Hypaque (Tianjin HaoYang Biological Manufacture, Tianjin, China) density gradient for isolation of mononuclear cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) were acquired by inflating lungs with 1 mL of complete RPMI 1640 medium via cannulation of the trachea and lavaging four times. Cells in the BALF were collected by centrifugation.\n\nCells were suspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium at a density of 2 \u00d7 106/mL, and stimulated with or without protein or peptides (10 \u03bcg/mL) for 72 hours in a round\u2010bottomed 96\u2010well plate, 200 \u03bcL/well, at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. The culture supernatants were collected for detection of IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1, and IL\u20102 by enzyme\u2010linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).\n\nCells were suspended in complete RPMI 1640 medium at a density of 2 \u00d7 106/mL, and stimulated with or without protein or peptides (10 \u03bcg/mL) for 24 hours in precoated BD\u2122 ELISPOT plates (BD Biosciences), 100 \u03bcL/well, at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. After washing, the plate was incubated with Biotinylated detection antibodies followed by Streptavidin\u2010HRP. AEC substrate was added into the wells for spot development, and the developing reaction was stopped by washing the wells with deionized water. The plate was air\u2010dried at room temperature, and the IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010producing cells were enumerated using ImmunoSpot S6 Analyser (Cellular Technology Ltd, Cleveland, OH, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The result shown is the mean of triplicate well readings.\n\nDetection of cell phenotype and intracellular cytokine expressions using flow cytometry has been previously described.9 In short, for phenotyping, cells were washed with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% sodium azide, and suspended into staining buffer. Cells were incubated with CD16/32 mAbs for 15 min on ice to block Fc receptors, then stained with phenotyping mAbs for 30 min at 4\u00b0C in the dark.\n\nFor intracellular cytokine staining, cells (2 \u00d7 106/mL) were stimulated with or without protein or peptides (10 \u03bcg/mL) plus anti\u2010CD28 (1 \u03bcg/mL) for 12 hours at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Brefeldin A (10 \u03bcg/mL, Sigma\u2010Aldrich) was added into the culture during the final 6 hours. The cells were washed twice with PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.05% sodium azide. After staining for phenotyping as described above, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS with 0.1% BSA and 0.05% sodium azide overnight at 4\u00b0C. Cells were washed and stained with the indicated mAbs for intracellular cytokine expressions for 30 min at 4\u00b0C in the dark. Cell samples were assayed by FACS Aria II (Becton Dickinson), and data were analysed with FlowJo (TreeStar, San Carlos, CA, USA). The following antibodies/reagents were purchased from BD Biosciences and used for flow cytometry assay: anti\u2010mouse CD16/32 (clone 2.4G2); Phycoerythrin\u2010Texas Red (PE\u2010CF594) conjugated\u2010CD3 (clone 145\u20102C11); Allophycocyanin\u2010Cyanin 7 (APC\u2010Cy7) conjugated\u2010CD4 (clone GK1.5); Phycoerythrin\u2010Cyanin 7 (PE\u2010Cy7) conjugated\u2010IFN\u2010\u03b3 (clone XMG1.2); Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugated\u2010IFN\u2010\u03b3 (XMG1.2); Fluorescein isothiocyanat (FITC) conjugated\u2010IFN\u2010\u03b3 (XMG1.2); Fluorescein isothiocyanat (FITC) conjugated\u2010TNF\u2010\u03b1 (MP6\u2010XT22); Phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated\u2010IL\u20102 (JES6\u20105H4); Fluorescein isothiocyanat (FITC) conjugated\u2010CD44 (IM7); Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugated\u2010CD44 (IM7); Peridinin chlorophyll protein Cyanin 5.5 (Percp\u2010Cy5.5) conjugated\u2010CD62L (MEL\u201014); Peridinin chlorophyll protein Cyanin 5.5 (Percp\u2010Cy5.5) conjugated\u2010CD103 (M290); Phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated\u2010CD45 (30\u2010F11); Allophycocyanin (APC) conjugated\u2010CXCR3 (CXCR3\u2010173); Phycoerythrin\u2010Cyanin 7 (PE\u2010Cy7) conjugated\u2010CXCR5 (2G8); Phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated\u2010CD127 (SB/199); Phycoerythrin\u2010Texas Red (PE\u2010CF594) conjugated\u2010CD279 (PD\u20101) (J43); Phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated\u2010CD152 (CTLA\u20104) (UC10\u20104F10\u201011); Fluorescein isothiocyanat (FITC) conjugated\u2010CD43 (S7); Phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated\u2010CD40L (MR1); and purified anti\u2010mouse CD28 (CD28.2). Fluorescein isothiocyanat (FITC) conjugated\u2010CD45 (clone I3/2.3) was purchased from BioLegend (San Diego, CA, USA).\n\nDetection of antigen\u2010specific antibodies in BALF and serum by ELISA has been previously described.38 In short, microtitre plates were coated with recombinant Rv3615c protein at 5 \u03bcg/mL in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH = 9.6) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The plates were washed with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 0.05% Tween 20/PBS at room temperature for 2 hours. Serially diluted BALF and serum samples were added into the plates, followed by washing three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. The binding immunoglobulins (sIgA, IgA, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgM) were captured with horse radish peroxidase (HRP)\u2010conjugated goat anti\u2010mouse sIgA mAb (Elabscience, Wuhan, China), HRP\u2010conjugated goat anti\u2010mouse IgA mAb, HRP\u2010conjugated goat anti\u2010mouse IgG1 mAb, HRP\u2010conjugated goat anti\u2010mouse IgG2a mAb (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA), and HRP\u2010conjugated goat anti\u2010mouse IgM mAb (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, AL, USA) respectively. The plates were washed with 0.05% Tween 20/PBS and developed using TMB substrate. The reaction was stopped with 2N H2SO4, and data were collected by an ELISA reader. The end\u2010point titre was defined as the highest dilution that gave an absorbance value above the optical density of 0.1 and was analysed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).\n\nAll statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc.) by either unpaired Student's t test when comparing two groups, one\u2010way ANOVA for more than two groups, or two\u2010way ANOVA for two variables. Data were presented as mean or mean \u00b1 SD. ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, *P < 0.05.\n\nTo explore the potency of adaptive immune responses induced by M.tb Rv3615c, we immunized mice subcutaneously (S.C.) with Rv3615c and Rv3615c plus CpG (Rv3615c+CpG) following the prime and boost scheme, respectively, and used PBS and CpG as controls (Figure 1). We examined mononuclear cells isolated from the spleen, lung, and mesenteric and inguinal LN tissues from the immunized mice for their cytokine production upon Rv3615c stimulation in vitro. Data showed that cells from mice immunized with Rv3615c+CpG produced higher level of cytokines than cells from those immunized with Rv3615c and controls (Figure 2A). Cytokine productions peaked at week 4, and maintained for at least 16 weeks, except for IL\u20104 production, which diminished earlier than IFN\u2010\u03b3, TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20102, and IL\u201017, and dropped to baseline of controls at week 8. We also observed that IL\u201017 production decreased significantly at week 12, while production of other Th1\u2010type cytokines maintained relatively steady. Mononuclear cells isolated from the LN had relative low cytokine production and retained the production for a shorter period than did cells isolated from other tissues, particularly for IL\u20104 production. Data suggested that Rv3615c+CpG immunization established an adaptive immune response in our mouse model, and S.C. immunization induced a systemic immunity that was mostly predominated with Th1\u2010type responses. The Rv3615c+CpG \u2010induced memory cells retained potency of responding to the cognate antigen at least 16 weeks. As an adjuvant, CpG enhanced the efficiency of Rv3615c immunization.\n\nTo find cell subsets responding to Rv365c, we analysed lineage differentiation of cytokine\u2010producing cells with flow cytometry. Data showed that most cytokine\u2010producing cells were CD3+ T cells, and Rv3615c+CpG was the most potent at inducing IFN\u2010\u03b3 production, with the frequency of IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010producing cells higher than that induced by other immunizations and controls (Figure 2B and C). This result was consistent with quantitative cytokine assay by ELISA. Among the cytokine\u2010producing T cells, majority (>80%) were CD4+CD8\u2212 T cells, and less than 20% were CD4\u2212CD8+ T cells (Figure 2D). Data suggested that Rv3615c preferably induced cytokine production of CD4+ T cells, consistent with our previous study on human PBMC.\n\nWe used overlapping peptides to screen epitopes recognized by Rv3615c\u2010specific T cells. These peptides were 15\u2010mer each, overlapped by 10 amino acids and spanning the entire region of the Rv3615c sequence. Using quantitative ELISA and ELISPOT\u2010counting, we found that Rv3615c36\u201050 and Rv3615c41\u201055 elicited mononuclear cells isolated from Rv3615c+CpG immunized mice to produce IFN\u2010\u03b3 (Figure 3A and B). The magnitude of IFN\u2010\u03b3 production and the number of IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010producing cells almost reached the level of those elicited by full\u2010length Rv3615c and by mixture of the overlapping peptides, and were significantly higher than those elicited by medium control. We observed similar patterns of response in cells isolated from the spleen, lung, and LN tissues, with cells isolated from the LN showing relatively low IFN\u2010\u03b3 production, which was consistent with kinetic data showing in Figure 2A. Based on the screening, we proposed a T\u2010cell epitope within amino acid 41\u201050, and generated peptide Rv3615c41\u201050. We used Rv3615c41\u201050 to stimulate mononuclear cells isolated from Rv3615c+CpG immunized mice and observed a magnitude of response similar to full\u2010length Rv3615c by quantitative IFN\u2010\u03b3 assessment and IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010producing cell\u2010counting (Figure 3C and D), which demonstrated a dominant T\u2010cell epitope at this location.\n\nTo study cell subset responding to Rv3615c41\u201050, we analysed lineage differentiation of the IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010producing cells using flow cytometry and found that T cells producing IFN\u2010\u03b3 were mostly CD4+ (\u226570%), and the frequencies were almost the same as those induced by full\u2010length Rv3615c (Figure 3E and F). Data demonstrated that Rv3615c contained an epitope of CD4+ T cells. This epitope was within amino acid 41\u201050, and could induce a dominant response of CD4+ T cells specific to Rv3615c.\n\nSince airway barrier is at the frontline against pathogen invasion, we wondered if intranasal (I.N.) immunization could preferably establish an adaptive immunity in the respiratory compartment locally. We immunized mice with R3615c+CpG I.N. following the prime and boost protocol, and compared cytokine levels in BALF and serum with samples from S.C. immunized mice from week 2\u201016. We found that I.N. immunization induced higher IFN\u2010\u03b3, IL\u201017, and IL\u201012p40 than S.C. immunization did in BALF (Figure 4A). The cytokine expressions peaked at week 4 after boost and maintained for at least 8\u201012 weeks. In contrast, S.C. immunization preferably elevated cytokines in serum, and had little effect on cytokines in BALF. Next, we compared cytokine productivity of cells following I.N. and S.C. immunizations. We found that cells isolated from lungs of mice with I.N. immunization produced higher levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 upon Rv3615c41\u201050 stimulation in vitro than did cells isolated from mice with S.C. immunization, while cells isolated from lymphoid tissues (spleen and LN) of mice immunized by those two approaches had the same IFN\u2010\u03b3 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 production (Figure 4B). The increased cytokine production in airway and lungs by I.N. immunization peaked at week 4 after boost and maintained for at least 16 weeks.\n\nConsistent with the quantitative cytokine assay, the frequency of cytokine\u2010producing cells preferably increased in the lungs following I.N. immunization. We stimulated mononuclear cells isolated from Rv3615c+CpG immunized mice with Rv3615c41\u201050, and examinated the frequency of cytokine\u2010producing cells. Data showed that I.N. immunization induced a higher frequency of IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010 and TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010producing cells in lung CD4+ T cells than S.C. immunization from week 2\u201016 after boost, and these two immunizations induced the same frequency of cytokine\u2010producing cells in the spleen and LN tissues (Figure 4C and D). The kinetics of cytokine\u2010producing cells was consistent with patterns of quantitative cytokine assay after in vitro stimulation. Data suggested that I.N. immunization preferably established a long\u2010lasting adaptive cellular immunity in the respiratory tissues.\n\nWe also studied antibody responses to I.N. and S.C. immunizations in the airways and in serum. I.N. immunization induced a higher titre of Rv3615c\u2010specific antibodies than did S.C. immunization in BALF (Figure 4E). The isotypes of antibodies were secretary IgA (sIgA), IgA, IgG1, IgG2, and IgM. The antibody responses peaked at week 4 after boost, and maintained for about 8\u201012 weeks, with the exception of IgM being maintained only for about 6 weeks. I.N. immunization also induced a higher titre of Rv3615c\u2010specific sIgA and IgA in serum than did S.C. immunization. The elevated sIgA and IgA in serum maintained for about 6 weeks. In contrast, S.C. immunization preferably induced IgG1 and IgG2 isotypes in serum, and induced the same titre of IgM as I.N. immunization did. Our data suggested that intranasal immunization preferably established a long\u2010lasting adaptive humoural immunity in respiratory system.\n\nWe studied the differentiation of CD4+ T cells following I.N. or S.C. immunization with Rv3615c+CpG. Data showed that I.N. immunization induced a higher frequency of CD44+CD62Llow expressions in lung CD4+ T\u2010cell population than S.C. immunization did (Figure 5A and B). Kinetic data showed that the significant increase of CD44+CD62Llow cells started from week 6 after the boost, and maintained at least for 16 weeks. Cells in the spleen and LN had similar kinetics and frequency of CD44+CD62Llow expression following I.N. and S.C. immunizations. Here, we defined cells with CD44+CD62Llow phenotype as effector\u2013memory cells (TEM),8 and our data suggested that I.N. immunization preferably increased the frequency of TEM at lung tissue compartment.\n\nWe also studied the profile of cytokine productions at week 12 after immunization with Rv3615c+CpG. Here, we used IFN\u2010\u03b3 production as an indicator of cell response to immunization. Our data showed that mice with I.N. immunization had a higher frequency of CD4+ T cells in the lungs than did mice with S.C. immunization, coexpressing triple\u2010 and double\u2010cytokines, such as IFN\u2010\u03b3+TNF\u2010\u03b1+IL\u20102+ triple expressions (11.8 \u00b1 2.85 vs 5.2 \u00b1 4.51, P < 0.01), IFN\u2010\u03b3+IL\u20102+ double expressions (18.3 \u00b1 5.31 vs 9.4 \u00b1 3.93, P < 0.001), and IFN\u2010\u03b3+TNF\u2010\u03b1+ double expressions (5.4 \u00b1 1.09 vs 2.9 \u00b1 2.30, P < 0.05). But mice with S.C. immunization had a higher frequency of CD4+ T cells that expressed IFN\u2010\u03b3 only in the lungs. Cells in the spleen had a similar pattern of cytokine expressions following I.N. and S.C. immunizations (Figure 5C and D). Our data suggested that I.N. immunization promoted a response of cells in lung tissues and induced differentiation towards an effector\u2013memory phenotype with a potency of multicytokine productions.\n\nWe explored the location of cells responding to I.N. and S.C. immunization. Cells in LP and LV were distinguished by in vivo labelling with fluorochrome\u2010conjugated anti\u2010CD45 antibody following a reported procedure 37 with minor modifications. Most T cells in BALF (>98%) were not stained by in vivo labelling due to the anatomic location, which demonstrated reliability of our labelling protocol (Figure 6A). We sampled mononuclear cells from lungs of mice at week 12 after immunization. Mice with I.N. immunization had the most CD4+ T cells detected in LP (>89%), while mice with S.C. immunization had roughly half in the parenchyma and half in LV (Figure 6A and B). With intracellular cytokine staining, we also found that I.N. immunization induced IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010producing cells that were mostly located in BALF and LP (99.9% and 73.7%, proportion of cells that were CD45\u2212 in IFN\u2010\u03b3+ population), while those induced by S.C. immunization were only 22.5% in parenchyma, and hardly to be seen in BALF (Figure 6C and D). Our data suggested that I.N. immunization selectively primed and expanded CD4+ T cells in BALF and LP, and increased their proportions in the total lung CD4+ T\u2010cell compartment, while S.C. immunization systemically expanded CD4+ T cells mostly in circulation.\n\nImmunization\u2010expanded cells in tissues might have a distinct profile of phenotype and cytokine expressions, representing functional diversity. We studied CD4+ T cells isolated from BALF and lung tissues of mice at week 12 of immunization with Rv3615c+CpG. More cells in BALF and LP expressed molecules associated with tissue residency (CD69 and CD130), chemokine receptors (CXCR3 and CXCR5), memory differentiation (CD127), costimulation (PD\u20101, CTLA\u20104 and CD40L), and activation (CD43 and CD25) than did cells in LV, while more cells in LV expressed molecules associated with homing (CD62L) (Figure 7A, and Table 1). We also studied cytokine profile of cells in tissues. In general, more cells in BALF and LP expressed cytokines compared to those in LV. Among them, IFN\u2010\u03b3 single, IFN\u2010\u03b3+ TNF\u2010\u03b1+ double, and IFN\u2010\u03b3+IL\u20102+ double expressions in BALF and LP were significantly higher. In contrast, more cells in LV expressed IL\u201010+ single, and IL\u201010+IFN\u2010\u03b3+ double than those in BALF and LV did (Figure 7B and C). The phenotype and cytokine profiles indicated functional diversity of cells in different tissue compartments responding to immunizations.\n\nEstablishment of a long\u2010term immune memory to a specific pathogen is essential for the success of a vaccination.38 In our previous study,9 we demonstrated that Rv3615c contained epitopes of human CD4+ T cells, and elicited Th1\u2010type dominant responses of CD4+ T cells from patients with tuberculosis pleurisy, which suggested a potential for inducing protective immunity against M.tb. To extend our knowledge, here, we used a mouse model to demonstrate that Rv3615c immunization not only elicited a Th1\u2010type response, but also induced memory differentiation of CD4+ T cells. We identified that Rv3615c contained an epitope of mouse CD4+ T cells, which is located within amino acids 41\u201050 (Rv3615c41\u201050) and is differed from epitopes of human CD4+ T cells, as we have previously reported. The quantity of IFN\u2010\u03b3 and number of IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010producing cells induced by Rv3615c41\u201050 were the same as those induced by full\u2010length Rv3615c and mixture of overlapping peptides. Although a few CD4\u2212 T cells expressed IFN\u2010\u03b3, the frequency was low. Thus, we demonstrated the Rv3615c41\u201050 containing a dominant epitope of mouse CD4+ T cells. After prime and boost with Rv3615c, the cytokine\u2010producing cells peaked at week 4. Most of the cytokine\u2010producing cells expressed IFN\u2010\u03b3 and TNF\u2010\u03b1; some of them expressed IL\u201017 and IL\u20102 in the spleen, lung, and LN. A few of them expressed IL\u20104, but the IL\u20104 production was only transient. The IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010, TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010, and IL\u20102\u2010producing cells were maintained for at least 16 weeks, while the IL\u201017\u2010producing cells declined in frequency significantly after 12 weeks. Since antigen\u2010specific memory CD4+ T cells with a Th1\u2010type profile were associated with a reduced M.tb burden in the animal model, an improved bacterial clearance, and less severe pulmonary inflammation in the human clinical trial,39, 40 our data suggested that Rv3615c induced a sustained adaptive immunity with the potential for a rapid response to M.tb challenge and protection against infection.\n\nImmunization\u2010induced memory cells located at the site of pathogen invasion are crucial for timely and efficient response to an infection. Different immunization routes utilize different subsets of antigen\u2010presenting cells, and consequently activate different subsets of CD4+ T cells at their specific tissue compartment26; establishing a long\u2010term resident CD4+ memory T\u2010cell population in barrier tissues through local immunization promoted regional immunity and demonstrated a key point for vaccine design.4, 41 S.C. immunization expanded Rv3615c\u2010specific CD4+ T cells systemically, in terms of elevated cytokines in serum, frequency of cytokine\u2010expressing cells, and quantity of cytokines in the lung, spleen, and LN tissues. Additionally, the cytokine\u2010expressing cells in the lungs were mostly in the vasculature, indicating a circulatory status. In contrast, I.N. immunization preferably elevated cytokines and cytokine\u2010producing cells in BALF and LP, suggesting a status of tissue residency. The quantity of cytokines and frequency of cytokine\u2010producing cells in lung were higher than those in the spleen and LN, and higher than those induced by S.C. immunization. In addition, I.N. immunization promoted not only regional immunity in the respiratory compartment but also systemic immunity, in terms of increased frequency of cytokine\u2010producing cells and cytokine productions in the spleen and LN at the level comparable to that induced by S.C. immunization. I.N. immunization with Rv3615c also established a sustained adaptive B\u2010cell immunity in the airway. The elevated Rv3615c\u2010specific antibodies in sIgA, IgA, IgG1, and IgG2a isotypes were maintained in BALF for at least 8\u201012 weeks post the prime and boost, and antibodies in IgM isotype were maintained for at least 6 weeks. I.N. immunization also elevated Rv3615c\u2010specific sIgA and IgA in serum, while S.C. immunization had no significant impact on antibody levels in BALF but elevated Rv3615c\u2010specific IgG1 and IgG2a only in serum. Although the role of antibody response on preventing M.tb infection and in eradicating the pathogen is still in debate and requires further investigation,42, 43 our study has demonstrated that I.N. immunization establishes a sustained adaptive immunity in the respiratory tract and in lung tissue, posing an advantageous response to pathogenic invasion without time\u2010consuming recruitment of effector cells from peripheral lymphoid tissues.44\n\n\nEfficiency of adaptive immunity depends not only on the magnitude of response but also on functional quality of cells responding to the infection. T cells with IFN\u2010\u03b3 only production were characterized as terminally differentiated and exhausted, and associated with active TB progression,45, 46 while effector\u2013memory CD4+ T cells with multicytokine coexpression were associated with control of M.tb and other infections.47 I.N. immunization showed preference of inducing CD44+CD62Llow effector\u2013memory CD4+ T cells (CD4+ TEM) in the lung, with a frequency higher than those in the spleen and LN, and those induced by S.C. immunization. Many CD4+ TEM cells coexpress multicytokines. The frequency of IFN\u2010\u03b3+ TNF\u2010\u03b1+ double\u2010expressing, and IFN\u2010\u03b3+ TNF\u2010\u03b1+ IL\u20102+ triple\u2010expressing cells induced by I.N. immunization was significantly higher than those induced by S.C immunization, and higher than the cells in the spleen and LNs induced by the same immunization. The elevated frequency of CD4+ TEM and multicytokine coexpressing cells in the lung was maintained for at least 16 and 12 weeks respectively. Multicytokine coexpression and effector\u2013memory phenotype represented a potency of CD4+ T cells in eradicating the pathogen and controlling the disease progression.45 Our data suggested that I.N. immunization with Rv3615c established an adaptive immunity with cells possessing functional quality and a sustainable response.\n\nUpon further analysis of cells after the prime and boost, our data revealed that I.N. immunization\u2010expanded cells were mostly in the respiratory tract and LP, while majority of S.C. immunization\u2010expanded cells were in the LV. Cells in BALF and LP had a higher frequency of effector\u2013memory differentiation (CD62Llow and CD127+), tissue residency (CD69+ and CD103+), migration and mucosal tissue homing (CXCR3+ and CXCR5+), costimulation (PD\u20101+, CTLA\u20104+ and CD40L+) and activation (CD43+ and CD25+) phenotypes, and higher frequency of IFN\u2010\u03b3+ and TNF\u2010\u03b1+ single and multicytokine (such as IFN\u2010\u03b3+TNF\u2010\u03b1+, IFN\u2010\u03b3+IL\u20102+) expressions than did cells in LV. This is consistent with their property of sustainable and rapid response to antigen stimulation. Studies showed that memory T cells located in mucosal tissues enhanced regional immunity by rapid control of infections.11, 26, 41, 48 These tissue\u2010resident memory T cells formed an immune barrier and functioned as a defence line to pathogenic invasions, and often coexpressed multicytokines and were potent at eliminating invading pathogens.11, 26 Thus, I.N. immunization with RV3615c could be an effective way to induce adaptive immunity in the airway and the lungs.\n\nIn our prime and boost procedure, adjuvant CpG promoted immunogenicity of Rv3615c. The use of CpG was based on our experience and previous studies.49 The adjuvant might activate the innate immune system, lower the threshold for signalling of activation, and reduce the quantity of antigen required for initiating an immune response.36 We have not, here, tried to figure out the mechanism of CpG's promoting of magnitude and altering of pattern of response to Rv3615c. Also, we have not distinguished if our I.N. prime and boost selectively expanded precursors of effector\u2013memory CD4+ T cells in the respiratory tissue compartment or initiated migration and differentiation of na\u00efve cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues, although the magnitude of response was relatively low in the lymphoid tissues. However, as an extension to our previous investigation, we have demonstrated that I.N. immunization with Rv3615c establishes a sustained adaptive immunity and a potential of rapid response to M.tb infections in the local respiratory system. The I.N. inoculation is not novel for test of TB and other vaccinations. To our knowledge, there are few, if any, reports on Rv3615c\u2010induced responses induced by I.N. in mouse model. We believe that our data provide information to support further investigation of the Rv315c as a vaccine candidate delivered by alternative routes. Limited by biosafety regulations, we are not qualified to test if immunization with Rv3615c could protect mice from a virulent M.tb challenge, and the potential of inducing sustainable adaptive immunity in humans requires further clinical study. The benefit of inducing effector\u2013memory CD4+ T cells with multicytokine production and a tissue\u2010resident property remain unclear in the context of this mouse model. Since M.tb proteins are expressed at different stages of the infection and induce distinct immune responses,50 immunization with Rv3615c elicits additional protection beyond those induced by BCG. We propose that a sustained vaccine\u2010induced CD4+ T\u2010cell response against a broad spectrum of targets, and with diverse functionalities, provides a better protection compared to a narrow response. Our study provides important information related to inducing broad spectrum and quality immunity against M.tb infections, and sheds light on the rational design of vaccines.\n\nThe authors confirm that there are no conflicts of interest.\n\nChangyou Wu, Jie Liu and Jiangping Li designed research; Jiangping Li, Jun Zhao, and Juan Shen performed research and analysed data; Jiangping Li, Changyou Wu, and Jie Liu wrote the paper; All authors approved the submitted and final versions."}
