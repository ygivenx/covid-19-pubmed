{"title": "Modelling the epidemiological trend and behavior of COVID-19 in Italy", "body": "The current surge of COVID-19 pandemic is devastating globally, with over 200,000 cases and more than 8600 deaths reported [1] . In Europe, COVID-19 cases are most dramatically started to increase from the first week of March 2020. Of these, Italy is grappling with the worst outbreak, with over 35,713 confirmed cases and around 3000 deaths by March 18, 2020 [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . This exponential increase in COVID-19 positive cases in Italy raised turmoil, and the government decree to a lockdown of the entire country [1] . Given the seriousness of the situation, it is absolutely necessary not only an immediate intervention but also a criterion for assessing its effectiveness.\n\nArticle on modeling epidemic transition of COVID-19 have been published [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] and based on the previous publication from China, South Korea, Iran, and Japan presented the estimation of epidemic trends and transmission rates [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Through this research, we evaluated the consistency of the containment rules and identified possible SARS-CoV-2 local mutation using the S.E.I.R mathematical model. We used the most representative epidemic parameters that occurred during the first half of March 2020 to predict the trend of infections. Therefore, to assess the effectiveness of the containment measures, it will signal the presence of a plausible evolutionary mutation. To do this, it will be sufficient to compare the general trend foreseen by the S.E.I.R. with the real Italian population.\n\nTo carry out this study, we used the most recent data, found in the scientific literature relating to COVID-19 total and active cases, deaths, recoveries, and all epidemic parameters, have been used. Since the Chinese situation has provided the most information, great statistical importance was given to the Sars-Cov-2 evolution in the Hubei region, with the implicit assumption of \"very significant local mutations\" absence necessary for generalizing the reports through classical inference. The statistics collected on virus mortality were first divided by age group and then recalibrated on the Italian demography, in order to be as representative as possible. To do this, we considered the most representative population of COVID-19 cases reported between March, 1-14, 2020, the number of infected persons necessary to approach the required mortality rate was added to the correct values.\n\nTo obtain a more realistic trend and assuming true the probable \"patients non-relapse\", and we applied S.E.I.R. model to predict the virus progress in Italy. As a note, it is not possible to estimate the containment measures taken by the government. However, at the same time, assuming that only half of the population was susceptible to the virus precisely due to the above containment measures. Thanks to the comparison between real and theoretical evolution, it is likely to estimate the presence of essential mutations and/or the limitation strategy effectiveness through similarities, anomalies, or substantial deviations from each other. We used S.E.I.R. differential equations and non-linear methods to resolve the gaps analytically. An interactive algorithm was developed using C++ software (version) to find a solution through a finite discretization method. The total population number has been considered constant because of the very low deaths/population ratio.\n\nBy entering the initial values for the incubation time 1/\u03c3, recovery time 1/\u03b3, basic reproduction number R0, and number of infected I0 on March 1, 2020, the software prints the S.E.I.R. values .

The best epidemic parameters were estimated through continuous iteration until the \"closest values to the real ones\" were reached until March 14, 2020. The number of initial incubates was calculated with the formula E0=R0\u00b7I0.\n\nAfter the reconstruction of the real data on COVID-19 in Italy in the period March 2020, 1-14, through the above methods, the best estimates obtained for the Italian epidemic parameters are 1/\u03c3 = (3\u00b11) days, 1/\u03b3 = (15\u00b13) days, R0 = 3.51 \u00b1 5%, I0 = 3350 \u00b1 20%.\n\nThe model predicts the following values for the next 7 days (March 2020, 15-22) with \"D \" .

Thus, thanks to the results obtained from the application of the S.E.I.R. model we can foresee three possible scenarios: If, in Italy, the real next-days trend of the total infected number will be lower than that shown in figure 1, we can assume the following events set out in order of probability: the containment measures adopted 10 days ago are taking effect; Sars-Cov-2 has undergone a significant anti-evolutionary mutation. If, in Italy, the real next-days trend of the total infected number will be equal than that shown in figure 1. We assume the following events set out in order of probability: the containment measures adopted 10 days ago are not taking effect; the containment measures adopted 10 days ago are taking effect and Sars-Cov-2 has undergone a significant evolutionary mutation. If, in Italy, the real next-days trend of the total infected number will be higher than that shown in figure 1. We assume the following events set out in order of probability: the containment measures adopted 10 days ago are not taking effect and Sars-Cov-2 has undergone a significant evolutionary mutation; the S.E.I.R model is no-more representative of the COVID-19 Italian case and we should utilize the S.E.I.R. model.\n\nBased primarily on the deaths number i.e. data with the lower margin of error, we compare real Even considering an admissible \"theoretical-estimates statistical error\" of \u00b1 5% these values could not be accepted since the trend indicates a faster growth than that predicted by the model .

However, unlike the aforementioned study, the prediction period will be extended to a certain number of days in order to verify the effectiveness of the containment measures in Italy.\n\nSince no European or international standard for data collection has been established, one of the crucial points of this analysis is the interpretation of the information available. On February 27, in Italy, a real \"communicative turnaround\" was announced so that only the most important symptomatic cases would be publicly counted from then on [6] . Since there do not appear to have been significant large-scale mutations and that a good amount of data is now available, we expect the WHO mortality data to be valid in Italy as well [13] [ Table 1 ].\n\nThe more recent study about Sars-Cov-2 mortality on symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in the Hubei region shows the following Sars-Cov-2 mortality per age-groups [3] [ Table 2 ].\n\nSince the Italian population is distributed according to the following age-percentages [15] [3] [ Table 3 ] \u03a3 i P i \u00b7 DR i / 100 = 3.2%\n\n.

On the other side, the true-infect number (as the aforementioned \"communicative turn\" announced) must necessarily be higher. Trying to respect the percentage just calculated we obtain the following table 4.\n\nCiting the adapted system of non-linear differential equations and their discretization [8] \n\nLegend: \u00b7 1/\u03b3 is the asymptomatic incubation time; \u00b7 1/\u03c3 is the recovery time;\n\n\u00b7 R0 is the basic reproduction number;\n\n.

All this is consistent both with the idea the infection had been present on the territory for some time, in the form of a less aggressive strain, than with the time course of the disease [1] .

Observed the comparison between the predictions of the S.E.I.R. and the actual trends highlighted above, as well as between the trends of Lombardy and the other Italian regions, there are valid reasons to assert that in Lombardy, in particular in the cities of Brescia, Bergamo and Milan, a very significant evolutionary mutation of the virus may be underway, which would require immediate containment. .
