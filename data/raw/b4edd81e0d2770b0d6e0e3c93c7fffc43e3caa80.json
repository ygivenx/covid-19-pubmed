{"title": "Role of temperature and humidity in the modulation of the doubling time of COVID-19 cases", "body": "The outbreak of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China during last December led to great efforts to prevent a global epidemic. The alert from China CDC was rapidly transmitted to the World Health Organization, 1-3 excluding possible causes such as influenza, adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). 1, [3] [4] The novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, and its genomic characterization was performed a few days after, permitting to devise a robust test method. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Although the genomic characterization revealed some relations both to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 4-6 the new virus was found to be much more aggressive than those other coronavirus or the seasonal one [4] [5] [6] . When human-to-human transmission was proved, on the 20th of January, the onset of the disease (COVID-19) has changed. 2, [7] [8] [9] [10] According to the China CDC 11 , the case fatality rate (CFR) was 0.2% at the end of January 2020 and 14.4% of the confirmed cases were considered severe or even critical. In the last week of February, 79441 cases were confirmed worldwide (97% in Mainland China) and the number of deaths was 2620 (95% in Mainland China). 12, 13 The epidemiological curves of COVID-19 in China showed the progression of illness in the outbreak over time from December 8, 2019 up to February 11, 2020, 11 when there were a total of 72314 confirmed cases as the geo-temporal spread of COVID- 19. 11 At that time, the majority of confirmed cases occurred in the northern hemisphere and until the last week of February 2020 no confirmed cases had been reported in South America or Africa, except for one .

We intend to add value to this discussion by evaluating the meteorological impact on COVID-19 duplication time.\n\nThe statistical model developed was implemented in two steps: firstly, an exponential model relating the accumulated number of confirmed cases and time was considered. Secondly, the rate of spread was used as dependent variable in a linear model that took as independent variables temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed.\n\nOnly cases belonging to China were considered as an attempt to control both cultural aspects and policies adopted to contain the virus. Therefore, data from the 31 provinces of Mainland China were gathered from the 23 rd January up to the 1 st of March, completing 39 days. These data were completed with meteorological variables, comprising temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed, collected for the same period, using the Meteostat Application Programming Interface (API). 21 We searched for meteorological stations containing hourly measurements of these variables for the whole 39-day time period that were closest .

A more natural way of interpreting is by transforming it into the doubling time, Td, given by:\n\nThe doubling time is the time needed to duplicate the number of infected subjects.\n\nSince the rate of progression changes over time and the exponential model does not hold any longer, we considered mainly the initial days of the time series, selecting several periods of time composed each one of a predetermined number of consecutive days, but with different starting points. The starting point was assumed by randomly choosing the first day of the period. For each province several periods were sampled, allowing to obtain more than one value of the rate of progression ( Figure 1 ).\n\nTwo different periods of time of 12 and 15 days were tested, along with 3 and 5 different starting points.\n\nFor each rate of progression, a corresponding value of each meteorological variable was computed, taking into account the same period of time. We opted to use the median of the meteorological variables (temperature, humidity, precipitation and wind speed) as it is more robust than the mean and tends to better represent the central tendency of the variable. Only models attaining more than 0.75 for the adjusted R square value were selected.\n\n.

Figure 2 depicts the curves obtained for the provinces that at the first time point (23 td of January) had only one or two cases.\n\n.

Since the objective of the study was to analyse the rate of spread, we decided to use periods of 12 and 15 days to determine it. The initial 25 days were thought to be the most informative regarding the rate of spread. The fits of temporal evolution of confirmed cases of COVID-19 of the remaining provinces are not shown, but a similar profile can be obtained, leading to the same conclusion.

Taking the values of doubling time Td and the meteorological variables, a linear regression was performed. Table 2 shows, for the 4 conditions studied, the results achieved from the linear regressions, that assumed temperature and humidity as independent variables.\n\n.

On the other hand, the amount of variation explained, given by the adjusted R square value, differs between models. The model based on 12 days and 3 sampled periods is able to explain 18% of the variance in the doubling time, which means that temperature and humidity alone may describe 18% of the variation of confirmed COVID-19 infections. More importantly, the signal and value of the coefficients of regressors are of utterly importance to understand how the spread of COVID-19 is expected to be affected by temperature and humidity. According to all models, temperature increases the doubling time, which means that it delays the spread of COVID-19. Humidity, on the contrary, benefits it. The models differ, however, on the amount of contribution: for example, in the best scenario (model: 15 days, n=3) the doubling time is increased by 0.090 days for each Celsius degree increase, and is increased by 0.072 days for each unit decrease of the humidity value.\n\nIn this work, the way temperature and humidity affect the doubling time of COVID-19 spreading was determined. Results suggest that temperature correlates .

This means that, with spring and summer, the rate of progression of COVID-19 is expected to be slower. Still, these two variables contribute at maximum to 18% of the variation, being the remaining 82% related to other factors such as containment measures, general health policies, population density, transportation, cultural aspects, etc.\n\nBesides, the direct impact is also small: for example, if temperature raises 20\u00baC, it is expected that in the best-case scenario the doubling time increases on average 1.8 days.\n\nThese results are in agreement with other studies that suggested that the aerosol spread of the influenza virus is both dependent upon relative humidity and temperature, although performed in animal models 14 , and that the virus survival in droplets is higher at high humidity levels with a significant decrease on its infectivity rate at mid-levels of humidity 15 . Additionally, other authors suggest that some diseases spread faster in high humidity levels 16 , reporting an odds ratio for a community-acquired pneumonia case, diagnosed with leggionaire's disease a , 3.1 times higher in high humidity level (above 80%) than when submitted to humidity levels below 50%, at temperatures of 16-27 \u00baC (60\u00ba-80\u00baF).\n\nWei Lo et al 17 However, their predictions were performed using SARS data and meteorological a Caused by bacteria, not virus, but symptoms are similar to flu, with pneumonia as an expected outcome.\n\n.

Yuwen Cai 20 did not find any correlation between the growth rate of the epidemy and daily mean temperature in either Wuhan or Hunan but found a weak correlation between the mortality in confirmed cases and daily mean temperature both in Wuhan (r = -0.441) and Hubei (r = -0.440), although not adjusted for the use of three makeshift hospitals, which proved to be effective.\n\nThe main focus of this work was to assess the relationship between the rate of spread of COVID-19 and some meteorological variables, which determines the type of model adopted. Although the reproduction number, R0, is the parameter widely accepted to characterize the velocity of spreading, there are different forms of computing it, which tend to lead to different results 22 . On the other hand, the R0 calculation is generally based on assumptions about the epidemic phenomenon such as serial interval distribution 25 or \"the population is closed, that all cases are observed, and use daily case counts only\" 26 . For the reasons mentioned, we opted for a simple/naive model that could assimilate the principal aspects of the variation of COVID-19 cases and translate it into a straightforward measurement (Td) that could be easily comprehended. Obviously, this model has several drawbacks mostly regarding the optimal period where an exponential growth is verified. We studied two different periods sizes and a random starting point aiming to analyse the impact of this aspect and as an attempt to mitigate its consequences. The doubling time values vary with the period size 26% at maximum (Table 1) , which is not neglectable. Even so, this difference only affects slightly the regression coefficients of temperature and humidity, since they do not show statistical differences.\n\nAnother point of possible bias is the COVID-19 data that do not cover all provinces from the beginning of the outbreak, making it difficult to study homogeneously in all provinces the time period that corresponds to the exponential growth.\n\n.

Measurements that better represent the central tendency of the meteorological variables felt by the general population of a particular region are currently being implemented.\n\nA final remark about the short average doubling time values obtained (3.78 to 4.53 days - Table 1 ), which should be a motive of concern. For each doubling time, the number of infected doubles, so one month of sustained growth at a conservative pace of 5 days means an increase of the number of infected by a factor of 64.\n\nFunded by National Funds via FCT (Foundation for Science and Technology) through the Strategic Project UIDB/04539/2020 and UIDP/04539/2020 (CIBB)."}
