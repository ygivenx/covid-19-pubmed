{"title": "", "body": "The dramatically rising prevalence of multi-drug-resistant microbial infections in the past few decades has become a serious health care problem. In particular, the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, for example methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermis and vancomycinresistant Enterococcus is a problem of ever-increasing significance. One way of overcoming this challenge is control of the use of currently marketed antibiotics; another is the development of novel antimicrobial agents. Consequently, the search for new antimicrobial agents will remain an important and challenging task for medicinal chemists [1] .\n\nAcquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has become a global pandemic and has claimed more lives than any other disease. According to the 2008 UNAIDS report released by the WHO, 33 million people were diagnosed as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive in 2007 [2] . Human T lymphocytes are target cells for HIV replication, and the MT-4 cell line is used for the screening of anti-HIV agents. In recent years, much attention has been devoted to the search for effective chemotherapeutic agents for inhibition of HIV with minimum side effects [3] .\n\nCancer is a disease of worldwide importance. Its incidence in the developed countries is increasing, and its mortality is ranked second in the order of causes of death. A similar tendency is observed in the developing world: gradual improvement in life expectancy is associated with elevated cancer incidence and mortality. Malignancy and its consecutive burden is therefore a global problem resulting in widespread interest in cancer therapy [4] .\n\nThe synthesis of novel pharmacologically active molecules with reduced toxicity is of prime interest. Recently, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) have gained importance in medicinal chemistry. QSAR are predictive tools used for preliminary evaluation of the activity of chemical compounds by use of computer-aided models. Use of QSAR has increased the probability of success in the drug-discovery process and reduced the time and cost involved [5] .\n\nHydrazones have attracted the attention of many chemists owing to their wide range of biological activity. Literature reports reveal that chemistry and biology of hydrazones have been intensively investigated during the past decade. Hydrazone derivatives have been found to have antimicrobial [6] , anticancer [7] , antimycobacterial [8] , antimalarial [9] , antioxidant [10] , anticonvulsant [11] , analgesic [12] , anti-inflammatory [13] , and antidiabetic [14] activity.\n\nMotivated by these facts, and in continuation of our research efforts in synthesis, evaluation of antimicrobial activity, and QSAR studies [15] [16] [17] [18] , we report herein the synthesis, antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer evaluation, and QSAR studies of N 0 -[4-[(substituted imino)methyl]benzylidene]-substituted benzohydrazides.\n\nChemistry Synthesis of the target compounds (1-48) was performed as outlined in Scheme 1. All the compounds were highmelting-point solids (m.p. [ 300\u00b0C). The structures of the compounds 1-48 were ascertained on the basis of their consistent IR, NMR, and mass spectral characteristics and results from elemental (C, H, N) analysis, all of which were in full agreement with their assigned molecular structures.\n\nThe synthesized compounds were screened for their in-vitro antibacterial activity against S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli and antifungal activity against Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger by the tube dilution method [19] using norfloxacin and fluconazole as reference standards for antibacterial and antifungal activity, respectively; the results are presented in Table 1 .\n\nAmong the synthesized compounds, N 0 -[4-[(2-chloro-4nitrophenylimino)methyl]benzylidene]-4-chlorobenzohydrazide (6) , N 0 -[4-[(2-chloro-4-nitrophenylimino)methyl] benzylidene]-4-aminobenzohydrazide (33), and N'-[4-[(2chloro-4-nitrophenylimino)methyl]benzylidene]-4-hydroxybenzohydrazide (37) were found to be effective against S. aureus, having pMIC sa values of 1.25, 1.23, and 1.23, respectively. Against B. subtilis, E. coli, and C. albicans, compounds 6, 33, and 37 emerged as the most effective antimicrobial agents with pMIC values of 1.55, 1.53, and [20] .\n\nThe antiviral assays were based on inhibition of virusinduced cytopathicity in CRFK, HEL, Vero, HeLa, and MT-4 cell cultures. The results of the antiviral evaluation are given in Tables 3, 4 , 5 and 6. None of the synthesized hydrazide derivatives inhibited viral replication at subtoxic concentrations.\n\nThe anti-HIV activity and cytotoxicity were evaluated against HIV-1 strain IIIB and HIV-2 strain ROD in MT-4 cell cultures using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method [21] ; the Table 7 . The results indicated that compound 29 (IC 50 C 1 lg/cm 3 ) was more potent than the standard drug nevirapine (IC 50 C 4 lg/cm 3 ) against the HIV-2 strain ROD; compound 39 (IC 50 C 4 lg/cm 3 ) was found to be equipotent.\n\nThe anticancer activity of the synthesized hydrazide derivatives against human colon cancer (HCT116) and breast cancer (MCF7) cell lines was determined by use of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay [22] ; the results are presented in Table 8 .\n\nIn general, the synthesized compounds had poor anticancer potential. Compounds 13, 20, 22, and 48 were effective against HCT116 cancer cell lines with IC 50 values of 40, 19, 30, and 30 lg/cm 3 , respectively, and compounds 15, 16, and 20 were effective against MCF7 cancer cell lines with IC 50 values of 35, 25, and 18 lg/cm 3 , respectively.\n\nThe results from antimicrobial, antiviral, and anticancer evaluation revealed that the nature of the substituents has a substantial effect on the biological activity of the target hydrazones; the structure-activity relationships (SAR) discussed below were deduced.\n\nResults of antimicrobial screening indicated that presence of electron-withdrawing 2-chloro-4-nitro substituents on the phenylimino structure of compounds 6, 33, and 37 increases antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, B. subtilis, E. coli, and C. albicans, whereas the presence of an electron-withdrawing nitro group on the benzoic acid structure and a chloro group on the phenylimino structure increases antifungal activity against A. niger. It is important to note that the incubation temperature was the same for all three bacterial species and C. albicans (a fungus). These similar incubation conditions may be the reason for the higher activity of compounds 6, 33, and 37 against C. albicans and the bacterial species. The effect of the electron-withdrawing group in improving antimicrobial activity is supported by the studies of Sharma et al. [23] .\n\n1. The presence of an electron-releasing group on the benzoic acid structure (13, 29, and 39) increases the anti-HIV activity of the synthesized compounds. 2. The presence of an electron-releasing group on the benzoic acid structure (13, 15, 16, 20, and 22) increases the anticancer potential of the synthesized compounds. The effect of an electron-releasing group in improving the anticancer potential of benzodiazepine derivatives is similar to the observation of Kamal et al. [24] . 3. The presence of an imino moiety does not improve the antimicrobial and anticancer potential of the synthesized compounds except for the propylimino moiety (48) which improved anticancer activity against human colon cancer cell lines (HCT 116). 4. The presence of the naphthalene-1-ylimino moiety (47) in the synthesized compounds does not improve antimicrobial and anticancer potential. 5. The aforementioned results indicate that different structural requirements are essential for a compound to be selected as antibacterial or antifungal agent. This is similar to results obtained by Sortino et al. [25] .\n\nTo identify the effects of substituents on antimicrobial activity, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) Table 1 ); these were used as dependent variables in the QSAR study. The different molecular descriptors (independent variables), for example the logarithm of the octanol-water partition coefficient (log P), molar refractivity (MR), Kier's molecular connectivity ( 0 v, 2 v v ) and shape (j 1 , ja 1 , ja 2 , ja 3 ) topological indices, the Randic topological index (R), the Balaban topological index (J), the Wiener topological index (W), total energy (Te), energies of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), dipole moment (l) and electronic energy (Ele. E) [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] were calculated for the hydrazide derivatives. Some of the values obtained are presented in Table 9 .\n\nOur earlier studies [15] [16] [17] indicated that multi-target QSAR (mt-QSAR) models are more suitable than one-target QSAR (ot-QSAR) models for describing antimicrobial activity. In this study, therefore, we developed multi-target QSAR models to describe the antimicrobial activity of compounds 1-48.\n\nFor ot-QSAR models one should use five different equations with different errors to predict the activity of a new compound against five microbial species. Use of ot-QSAR models, which are used almost throughout the literature, were not practical, however, when we had to predict each compound's action against more than one target. In those cases we had to develop one ot-QSAR model for each target. However, very recently interest has increased in the development of multi-target QSAR (mt-QSAR) models. As opposed to ot-QSAR, the mt-QSAR model is a single equation that considers the nature of molecular descriptors which are common and essential for describing the antibacterial and antifungal activity [32] [33] [34] [35] .\n\nIn this study, we attempted to develop three different types of mt-QSAR model, viz. an mt-QSAR model to describe the antibacterial activity of the synthesized compounds against S. aureus, B. subtilis, and E. coli, an mt-QSAR model to describe the antifungal activity of the synthesized compounds against C. albicans and A. niger, and a common mt-QSAR model to describe the antimicrobial (overall antibacterial and antifungal) activity of the synthesized hydrazide derivatives against all the above mentioned microorganisms.\n\nTo develop mt-QSAR models, initially we calculated the average antibacterial, antifungal, and antimicrobial activity of the hydrazide derivatives (Table 1) . These average antibacterial activity values were correlated with the molecular descriptors of the synthesized compounds (Table 10) .\n\nA high interrelationship was observed among topological indices, the Wiener index (W), and the Randic index (R, r = 0.989), and a low interrelationship was observed between the lipophilic parameter log P and the electronic property energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) (r = 0.046). Correlation of average antibacterial, antifungal, and antimicrobial activity values with different molecular descriptors is shown in Table 11 .\n\nFrom the correlation matrix (Table 10) , it was observed that the electronic property total energy (Te) dominated description of the antibacterial activity of the synthesized compounds (Eq. 1).\n\nLR-mt-QSAR model for antibacterial activity:\n\npMIC ab \u00bc \u00c00:00011Te \u00fe 0:830\n\nwhere n is the number of data points, r is the correlation coefficient, q 2 is the cross validated r 2 obtained by the leave-one-out (LOO) method, s is the standard error of the estimate, and F is the Fischer statistic.\n\nBecause the coefficient of Te in Eq.\n\n(1) is negative, antibacterial activity of synthesized compounds will decrease with increasing Te value. This is evidenced by the high antibacterial activity of compound 6 (pMI-C ab = 1.45 lM/cm 3 ) which has a low Te value (Te = -5,411.83).\n\nTo improve the value of the correlation coefficient (r), the electronic property total energy (Te) was coupled with the lipophilicity log P; as a result the r value increased from 0.664 to 0.706 (Eq. 2).\n\nMLR-mt-QSAR model for antibacterial activity:\n\npMIC ab \u00bc \u00c00:020 log P \u00c0 0:000096Te \u00fe 0:791\n\nThe developed model was cross validated by the LOO method [36] . The q 2 value is\\0.5 (Eq. 2), which showed that the developed model is invalid. According to the recommendations of Kim et al. [37] , however, regression models are acceptable if the value of the standard deviation (SD , Table 1 ) is \\0.3. Because the value of standard deviation is \\0.3, the developed model (Eq. 2) is a valid one. Furthermore, the observed and predicted antibacterial activity values are close to each other (Table 12) , so the mt-QSAR model for antibacterial activity (Eq. 2) is a valid one. The plot of predicted pMIC ab against observed pMIC ab (Fig. 1) also favours the developed model expressed by Eq. (2) . Further, the plot of observed pMIC ab versus residual pMIC ab (Fig. 2) indicated that there was no systemic error in model development because the propagation of error was observed on both sides of zero [38] .\n\nKier's second-order shape index (j 2 ) was found to be the most dominating descriptor explaining the antifungal activity of the synthesized substituted hydrazide derivatives (Table 11) . LR-mt-QSAR model for antifungal activity: \n\nIt is clearly evident from Eq. (3) that the antifungal activity of the synthesized compounds is positively correlated to Kier's second-order shape index (j 2 ), i.e. the antifungal activity of the compounds will increase with increasing j 2 value. High antifungal activity of compounds 25 and 27 (pMIC af = 1.66) having a high j 2 value (j 2 = 12.14) illustrates the positive correlation. Very useful topological indices of the second generation are the j indices of molecular shape and flexibility [39] . According to Kier, the shape of a molecule may be partitioned into attributes, each described by the count of bonds of various path lengths. The basis for devising a relative index of shape is given by the relationship between the number of paths of length l in the molecule i, l P i , and reference values based on molecules with a given number of atoms, n, in which the values of l P are maximum and minimum, l P max and l P min . The first-order shape attribute, j 1 , is given by the expression:\n\nThe second and third-order kappa indices are defined as follows:\n\nCoupling of the topological index Kier's second order shape index (j 2 ) with the electronic property energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) resulted in an increase in the r value from 0.667 to 0.695 (Eq. 4).\n\nMLR-mt-QSAR model for antifungal activity:\n\npMIC af \u00bc \u00c00:067j 2 \u00c0 0:0076 Lumo \u00fe 0:641\n\nAlthough the q 2 value derived for Eq. (4) by the LOO method was \\0.5, which made the model invalid, the low residual values observed for antifungal activity predictions using Eq. (4) ( Table 12 ) and low standard deviation (Table 1 ) resulted in the QSAR model for antifungal activity being a valid one. The antimicrobial activity of the synthesized hydrazide derivatives was best explained by a topological index, the Wiener index (W) ( Table 11) .\n\nLR-mt-QSAR model for antimicrobial activity:\n\nThe Wiener index W = W(G) of G is defined as the half sum of the elements of the distance matrix:\n\nwhere (D)ij is the ijth element of the distance matrix which denotes the shortest graph-theoretical distance between sites i and j of G [31] . Similar to the antifungal activity, the antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds also positively correlated with the Wiener index (W) ( Table 11 ). Addition of the electronic property energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) to the topological index W resulted in the best model for describing antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds (Eq. 6).\n\nMLR-mt-QSAR model for antimicrobial activity:\n\nThe electronic property LUMO, which denotes the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, is directly related to electron affinity and characterizes the sensitivity of the molecule to attack by a nucleophile. The contribution of LUMO to describing antimicrobial activity may be attributed to the interaction of hydrazide derivatives with a nucleophilic amino acid residue, for example cysteine, of microorganisms [40] .\n\nThe validity and predictability of the QSAR model for antimicrobial activity, i.e. Eq. (6) is evidenced by the high q 2 value (q 2 [ 0.5) obtained by the LOO method and the low residual activity values (Table 12 ). In summary, QSAR analysis indicated the importance of the topological index, the Wiener index (W), and the electronic property, the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), in describing the antimicrobial activity of N 0 -[4-[(substituted imino)methyl]benzylidene]-substituted benzohydrazides.\n\nGenerally, for QSAR studies, the biological activity of the compounds should span two to three orders of magnitude but in this study the range of antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds is within one order of magnitude. This is similar to results obtained by Bajaj et al. [41] who stated that the reliability of the QSAR model lies in its predictive ability even though the activity data are in a narrow range. When biological activity data is in a narrow range, a low standard deviation of the biological activity justifies its use in QSAR studies [42] . The low standard deviation observed in the antimicrobial activity data in Table 1 justifies its use in QSAR studies. A mixture of 80 mmol substituted benzoic acid and 34.04 g (43.14 cm 3 , 0.74 mol) ethanol was heated under reflux in the presence of sulfuric acid until completion of the reaction. When the reaction was complete, the reaction mixture was added to 200 cm 3 ice-cold water and the ester formed was extracted with 50 cm 3 ether. The ether layer was separated and, on evaporation, yielded the crude ester which was then recrystallized from alcohol. Hydrazine hydrate (99 %, 0.015 mol) was added to an ethanolic solution of ester (0.01 mol) and the mixture was heated under reflux for 5 h. The reaction mixture was then cooled and the precipitate was isolated by filtration, washed with water, dried, and recrystallized from ethanol. A solution of 6.70 g terephthaldehyde (50 mmol) in 50 cm 3 ethanol was added to a solution of the substituted benzoic acid hydrazide (synthesized above; 0.05 mol) in 50 cm 3 ethanol. The mixture was heated under reflux for 5 h. The reaction mixture was then left to cool at room temperature and the precipitated hydrazone was isolated by filtration, dried, and recrystallized from ethanol.\n\nA solution of 50 mmol of the above synthesized hydrazone in 50 cm 3 DMF was added to a solution of 50 mmol substituted anilines/amines/naphthalen-1-amine in 50 cm 3 DMF. The mixture was heated under reflux for 5 h followed by cooling in an ice bath and the resulting product was isolated by filtration and purified. \n\nThe anti-HIV activity and cytotoxicity were evaluated against HIV-1 strain IIIB and HIV-2 strain ROD in MT-4 cell cultures by use of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. Briefly, virus stocks were titrated in MT-4 cells and expressed as the 50 % cell culture infective dose (CCID 50 ). MT-4 cells were suspended in culture medium at 1 9 10 5 cells/cm 3 and infected with HIV at a multiplicity of infection of 0.02. Immediately after viral infection, 100 mm 3 of the cell suspension was placed in wells of a flat-bottomed microtiter tray containing different concentrations of the test compounds. After incubation for four days at 37\u00b0C, the number of viable cells was determined by use of the MTT method. Compounds were tested in parallel for cytotoxic effects in uninfected MT-4 cells.\n\nThe anticancer activity of compounds 1-48 was determined against human colon (HCT116) and breast (MCF7) cancer cell lines. All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (PAA Laboratories) and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin (PAA Laboratories). Cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 . Anticancer activity of synthesized compounds at different concentrations was assessed by use of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Sigma) assay, as described by Mosmann [22] , but with minor modification, after incubation for 72 h. Assay plates were read by use of a spectrophotometer at 520 nm. Data generated were used to plot a dose-response curve from which concentrations of the test compounds required to kill 50 % of cell population (IC 50 ) were determined. Anticancer activity was expressed as the mean IC 50 from three independent experiments.\n\nThe structures of 1-48 were first pre-optimized by use of MM ? procedure included in Hyperchem 6.03 [45] and the resulting geometries were further refined by means of the semiempirical method PM3 (Parametric Method-3). We chose a gradient norm limit of 0.04 kJ/\u00c5 for the geometry optimization. The lowest energy structure was used for each molecule to calculate physicochemical properties using TSAR 3.3 software for Windows [46] . Further, the regression analysis was performed by use of the SPSS software package [47] ."}
