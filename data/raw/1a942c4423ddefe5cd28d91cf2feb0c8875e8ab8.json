{"title": "Alveolar macrophages in allergic asthma: An expression signature characterized by heat shock protein pathways", "body": "Asthma is a chronic disorder of the airways characterized by reversible airflow obstruction, airway inflammation, remodeling, and hyperresponsiveness [1] . Several functional aspects of AM justify their study in allergic asthma. These cells, distributed from the alveoli to the upper airways, are the main immune cells in the airway lumen and are in direct contact with exogenous agents. They participate in lung immune homeostasis through phagocytosis and the release of mediators in response to these agents [2] . They also modulate immune response by inhibiting antigen presentation by dendritic cells, T-cell activation, and B-cell antibody production [3, 4] .\n\nMoreover, AM are stimulated in the course of innate and acquired immunity, including humoral immune responses associated with the production of antibodies and cellular immune responses characterized by the production of T h 1 (interferon (IFN)-\u2425, interleukin (IL)-12, IL-18) and T h 2 (IL-4, IL-13) lymphokines, as well as by IL-10, the main regulatory cytokine [5] . These types of activations induce different responses from these cells. Indeed, they can produce both pro-and anti-inflammatory mediators, as well as T h 1 and T h 2 cytokines, and consequently have the capacity to orientate the type of immune response triggered [5, 6] .\n\nDifferences have been observed in AM phenotype of allergic asthmatic subjects compared with healthy subjects. Indeed, allergic asthmatic AM show a lower phagocytic activity and a greater antigen presentation activity than control cells [7, 8] . Moreover, the transfer of AM from allergy-resistant rats (Sprague-Dawley) to allergy-susceptible rats (Brown Norway) demonstrates the importance of AM in inhibiting the early phase reaction and airway hyperresponsiveness in response to allergen challenge. It also suggests a different phenotype for AM of allergy-susceptible rats [9] .\n\nCharacterization of the expression profile of AM of asthmatic and control subjects should help to better understand the implication of this cell in asthma. Microarray analyses of gene expression have already demonstrated their effectiveness in the characterization of tissue or cellular phenotype in asthma and other complex traits [10] . One of its principal advantages is to allow the discovery of novel possible pathways as this technique looks at all genes independently of their respective known functions [10] . According to this, gene expression microarrays have been chosen to achieve the principal goal of this study, which was to characterize AM phenotype of allergic asthmatic subjects. Our results demonstrated a possible implication particularly for HSP in the immune functions of AM in asthma physiopathology, as nine HSP were underexpressed by AM of allergic asthmatic subjects. Moreover, protein level of HSP60 suggests especially a role for this biomarker in immune functions of this cell type.\n\nFive control subjects without allergy or asthma and five allergic asthmatic subjects meeting the American Thoracic Society criteria for the diagnosis of asthma [11] participated in microarray and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) studies. All subjects were recruited at respiratory specialized clinic and gave their consent for participation. The baseline evaluation included a questionnaire on health status and respiratory conditions, a physical examination, skin prick tests using 26 common aeroallergens (pets, house dust mites, dust, tree pollens, grass pollens, ragweed, molds, and feather) and the measurements of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) and of the dose of methacholine that resulted in a 20% fall in FEV 1 (PC 20 ) . Clinical characteristics of the subjects are given in Table 1 . Asthmatic subjects had positive skin prick tests (at least one positive response, i.e., wheal diameter \u05463 mm at 10 minutes). Table 2 lists the tested allergens and the sensitization profile of the subjects. Asthmatic subjects presented asthma symptoms that required treatment with an inhaled short-acting \u2424 2 -agonist on demand or associated allergic rhinitis symptoms that required a histamine-antagonist on demand. The bronchoscopies and the bronchoalveolar lavages were performed for research purposes only; they were performed as previously described on local anesthesia and using five 60-ml boluses of prewarmed saline solution in the right middle lobe [12] . To improve homogeneity of the samples, bronchoalveolar lavages were performed at the same time of the day and only if subjects did not experience inflammatory or allergen response (e.g., flu or hay fever) during the previous month. Bronchoalveolar lavages were not performed during the pollen season for the sensitized subjects. RNA was available for four subjects per phenotype to run real-time RT-PCR.\n\nAM were purified by adherence (2 hours) from bronchoalveolar lavage, giving purity \u03fe98%. Cell purity was verified using Diff-Quik staining. RNA was isolated using a silica gel-based RNeasy spin column protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Microarray analysis was performed with Affymetrix Genechip HG-U133A microarrays containing 22,283 oligonucleotide target probes (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Hybridization and scanning of image were performed at the McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre (www. genomequebec.mcgill.ca). To minimize technical variability, RNA processing steps (RNA extraction, probe labeling and chip hybridization) were performed in parallel for control and asthmatic samples. Detailed probe synthesis hybridization and washing protocol have been previously described [13] . The scanned images were analyzed using the Microarray Analysis Suite 5.0 (MAS5, Affymetrix) and the raw image files obtained (CEL format) were used for statistical analysis. Analyses were performed with the Affy and Limma packages available in Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org), which uses R language (http://www.R-project.org) [14, 15] . Quality tests to look at artifact or variability among microarrays were done with the Affy package. Probe intensities from the 10 chips were first normalized using robust multi-array analysis (RMA), which comprises background correction, quantile normalization, and median polish steps. Use of the RMA method in conjunction with p value and fold change cut-off (p value \u03fd 0.05 and absolute fold change \u03fe1.50) allowed us to not perform multitesting correction [16, 17] . To even better decrease false discovery rate, Smyth's moderated t test was used instead of standard t test (Limma package) [16] . Mean calculated for all allergic asthmatic subjects of each group. Only ranges are shown for control subjects because of noncontinuous data.\n\nAllergen sensitization profiles of allergic asthmatic individuals This sample was only used for microarray analyses because there was not enough RNA to do real time RT-PCR.\n\nFive genes (chemokine CC beta receptor 1 (CCR1), heat shock 60-kDa protein 1 (HSPD1), 2,5-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1), prion protein (PRNP), and serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade H (heat shock protein 47), member 1, (SERPINH1)) were selected to be tested using real-time RT-PCR. First, RNA integrity was evaluated using capillary electrophoresis. Sensiscript RT (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) with oligodT (20) primers was used for cDNA synthesis. The SYBR Green RT-PCR reaction was performed in 72wells in the Rotor-Gene 3,000 (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia) with 1.5 ng of genomic DNA and 1.5-2.5 mM MgCl 2 , buffer 1X (1.5 mM MgCl 2 ), 0.8 mM dNTPs, 0.4 M gene-specific primers (see Supplementary material), 0.5X SYBR Green, and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) for a final volume of 20 l. For SERPINH1, QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit was used with QuantiTect Primer Assay (Hs-SERPINH1_1-SG; Qiagen). Each sample was run in triplicate with a negative control and averaged for final RNA quantification. A standard curve was done with three serial dilutions in triplicate for each selected gene and for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), which was used as housekeeping gene. Quantification obtained from standard curves of each gene was normalized to the relative amount of GAPDH using the two standard curves method implemented in the Rotor-Gene 6 software (version 6.0). Measures of expression for the two phenotypes expressed as mean \u03ee SEM were compared by Student's unilateral t test. A p value \u03fd0.05 was considered significant.\n\nThe sample comprised 253 families (probands and their relatives) originating from Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean for a total of 1275 DNAs. A proportion of 37.0% of relatives were affected by asthma and 51.3% were atopic. All information concerning sample recruitment and clinical evaluation of the subjects were described in a recent report [18] . Clinical characterization is available in Table 2 of the Supplementary material. (Also see the Supplementary material for a description of the methodology.)\n\nCells were obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of nine control subjects without allergy and asthma as well as nine allergic asthmatic subjects. All subjects gave their consent for the study. Clinical evaluation and bronchoalveolar lavage procedure were done as described earlier there. Tables 1 and 2 list clinical characteristics and allergen sensitization profiles of the subjects. Asthmatic subjects presented asthma symptoms that required treatment only with an inhaled short-acting \u2424 2 -agonist on demand or associated allergic rhinitis symptoms that required a histamineantagonist on demand.\n\nProtein expression was observed using ABComplex/AP method (Dako Cytomation, Mississauga, ON, Canada) as previously described [19] . Slides were fixed with PLP-sucrose, and coloration was done using Fast Red and Mayer's hematoxylin (Dako Cytomation). The anti-HSP60 antibody used for this experimentation was the H1830-77 from US Biological (Swampscott, MA) and the secondary antibody was the polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse (E0464) from Dako Cytomation. Isotype-matched immunoglobulin was used as control (0311D, Becton Dickinson).\n\nAM were purified by adherence (2 hours) from bronchoalveolar lavage, giving purity \u03fe98%. Concentrations of HSP60 were mea-sured in cell lysates using HSP60 ELISA Kit (Stressgen Bioreagents, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein level was expressed as mean \u03ee SEM. Differences of expression were analyzed by Student's t test and considered significant when p \u03fd 0.05. The sensitivity of the assay has been determined to be 3.125 ng/ml. This study was approved by the Centre de sant\u00ca et de services sociaux de Chicoutimi and the Laval Hospital Human Ethic Committees.\n\nAM gene expression of allergic asthmatic and control subjects showed significant (p \u03fd 0.05) differences in the expression of 50 genes (58 transcripts), which were classified into nine biologic function categories ( Table 3) . Nineteen of these genes (38%) were classified into categories linked to stress or immune responses; immune signaling molecules, and immune and stress responses. Nine members of the HSP family are underexpressed in allergic asthmatic compared with control subjects.\n\nBecause of the large quantity of genes tested simultaneously, before going further with analyses of differentially expressed genes, results have to be validated by another technique to avoid false positives. Consequently, five genes (CCR1, HSPD1, OAS1, PRNP, and SERPINH1) were selected from the two immune and stress categories to be tested using real-time RT-PCR. They were selected according to known functions suggesting a possible involvement in asthma pathogenesis ( Table 3 ). Considering that nine HSP genes are found differentially expressed, a particular interest was given to this family. Indeed, among the nine HSP genes, two genes that were not documented in alveolar macrophages but have known functions possibly linked to asthma development were selected. Of the five genes selected, only CCR1 has been shown to be expressed in AM [20] , but a possible difference of expression linked to asthma has not been documented yet. Real-time RT-PCR showed expression of all five genes in AM from control and asthmatic subjects and confirmed the difference in gene expression between asthmatic and control for three of them: HSPD1, PRNP and SERPINH1 (Fig. 1 ). Real-time RT-PCR data showed that these three genes were significantly underexpressed in AM of asthmatic subjects (2.16-, 1.52-, and 3.63-fold, respectively; p \u03fd 0.05), as observed in microarray data (2.08-and 1.52-fold for two HSPD1 transcripts, and 1.75-and 1.80-fold for PRNP and SERPINH1, respectively; p \u03fd 0.05, Table 3 ).\n\nTo determine whether the difference of expression for these three genes in asthmatic subjects can be explained by genetic variants, genetic association tests were performed between tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) distributed in each of these genes and asthma (see Supplementary material). Familybased association testing revealed no significant association for asthma, suggesting that no tagSNP seems to be responsible or in linkage disequilibrium with SNP responsible of the lower expression observed for the three genes in asthmatic subjects (data not shown).\n\nHSPD1, one of the three validated gene, encodes HSP60. This HSP has been recently linked to the regulation of immune response [21] [22] [23] [24] , but its involvement in AM functions has not yet been investigated. Therefore, this gene was selected for subsequent analyses to compare its protein and genetic expression in alveolar macrophages of control and asthmatic subjects. The immunocytochemistry data showed similar expression of HSP60 protein in AM of control and asthmatic subjects (90% \u03ee 5% and 90% \u03ee 4% of positive cells for control and asthmatic subjects, respectively). This result was not surprising, as HSP60 is constitutively expressed in cells for its chaperone activity [25] . However, the result suggested a difference in each cellular protein level instead of a difference in the number of cells expressing the protein (Fig. 2 ). Thus, HSP60 protein level in cell lysates of AM from control and asthmatic subjects was measured using ELISA. HSP60 level was significantly higher in AM of asthmatic subjects (35.0 \u03ee 14.5 ng/ml) compared with controls (15.4 \u03ee 10.8 ng/ml) (Fig. 3 ). This represents a 2.28-fold increase, which contrasts with the 2.16-fold decrease of HSPD1 mRNA level observed in AM of asthmatic subjects (Fig. 1 ).\n\nGenomic expression profiling of AM presented in this study corresponds to the basic state of asthmatic subjects (unchallenged) and should help in understanding the implications of this cell type in the development of airway allergic asthmatic response. Interestingly, 38% of the differentially expressed genes are part of the immune signaling response and the stress and immune responses categories (Table 3) , supporting the hypothesis of an implication of AM in the development of asthma physiopathology. Moreover, the nine genes in the HSP family that are underexpressed in allergic asthmatic subjects suggest an implication for this gene family in particular. Indeed, even if endogenous HSP have been first known for their chaperone functions, studies have now demonstrated implications for some of them (HSP60, 70, 90 and 110) in the immune response (for a review, see Pockley et al. [26] ). More precisely, endogenous HSP60 and HSP70 have shown anti-inflammatory properties in studies in rheumatoid or juvenile arthritis and in animal models [26] .\n\nTwo studies have shown HSP differential gene expression in asthma. A study by Youssef et al. demonstrated that many HSPs are more expressed by stimulated basophils, and that histamine released by basophils is increased in allergic asthmatic subjects [27] . Another study has performed gene expression profiling and genome-wide analysis in a familial sample of asthma using lymphoblastoid cell lines. Their goal was to look at genes that combine heritability for expression levels and peak lod score for association with asthma. Genes involved in the response to unfolded proteins, which include chaperonins and HSP [28] , were found among the genes targeted in their study. Data from our study, jointly with these two other studies, support the implication of the HSP gene family in asthma through different cell types.\n\nDifferences of expression observed in microarray results may be explained by different biologic mechanisms. In some cases, it can be the effect of mutations in regulatory regions of the differentially expressed genes. However, the family-based association analysis done in this study for the three validated genes by real-time RT-PCR (HSPD1, PRNP, and SERPINH1) indicated that tagSNP do not seem to explain differences of gene expression observed (data not shown). However, as these differences of expression have been validated by a second technique, it suggests that they probably are the result of other mechanisms as modulation above in their respective biologic pathway or epigenetic regulation [29] . Real-time RT-PCR was selected to validate genomic expression data because this technique usually confirm about 87% of microarray results done using RMA analyses [30] . It is consistent with the confirmation of the underexpression of three of the five genes (HSPD1, PRNP, and SERPINH1) in allergic asthmatic compared with control AM, according to the small number of genes tested (Fig. 1) . Consequently, it is interesting to note that genetic expression of none of the validated genes has been documented in AM yet. Moreover, they all have functions possibly linked to the implication of AM in asthma pathogenesis.\n\nThe first differentially expressed gene, PRNP, encodes PRP, a prion protein. Cellular PRP, in opposition to scrapie PRP, is involved in the modulation of cell apoptosis [31] , negatively modulates peritoneal macrophage phagocytosis activity [32] , and has superoxide dismutase activity [33] . These functions have a direct impact on the number of inflammatory cells in the airways and then in the regulation of airway inflammation in asthma.\n\nSERPINH1 encodes HSP47, a collagen-specific chaperone. This protein is associated with inflammatory diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis, vascular and rheumatoid diseases, and cancer [34] . However, its possible immune functions, such as those recently documented for other members of the HSP family, have not been studied yet.\n\nFinally, the second HSP validated gene, HSPD1, encodes HSP60. This protein has a regulatory effect on T cell immune functions in three principal ways. First, it stimulates secretion by T cell, regulatory T cell (Treg), and B cell, of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [21] [22] [23] . Second, HSP60-stimulated Treg also inhibits two proinflammatory cytokine secretion by T cell; tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IFN-\u2425 [23] . Third, HSP60 has the capacity to inhibit T-cell chemotaxis [24] . It may also have an autocrine effect on AM, as direct binding of this protein on a specific receptor on this cell type has been demonstrated [35] . Consequently, all of these functions support an implication for this protein in immune roles of AM in asthma pathogenesis. Indeed, it suggests that HSP60 may downregulate the immune response, thereby preventing asthma development.\n\nFor all of the reasons mentioned above, HSP60 was selected to document its protein level in asthmatic and control AM and to compare it with the difference in gene expression observed. The sample sizes used for the gene expression profiling and the protein level analyses may seem limited. However, they were sufficient to achieve statistical significance between phenotypic groups in both experiments [36, 37] . Furthermore, the use of both robust normalization and cut-offs for p value and fold change in gene expression profile allowed detecting differentially expressed genes with the used sample size [13, 15, 38] . Moreover, the relative uniformity within and between the asthmatic groups is a major strength of the study. Indeed, the good similarity for lung function for all allergic asthmatic subjects included in this study, and the fact that they have comparable medication and allergen sensitization profiles (Tables 1 and 2) , eliminates confounding with regard to asthma medication dosage and atopic status.\n\nAs observed in this study, genetic expression and protein level for a specific gene are often contrasting (up to 50% of the time) [39] . There are three principal reasons for mRNA and protein level discrepancy: post-transcriptional mechanisms, the in vivo half-life of proteins, and the errors and noises in mRNA and protein measurement techniques [39] . Interestingly, Gustavsson et al. have evaluated the half-life of HSP60 in HELA cells to be 37.5 \u03ee 2.7 hours [40] . According to this long half-life, a decrease in HSPD1 mRNA expression might be visible in protein level only several hours later. Moreover, it is documented that protein level can be regulated at transcriptional or at translational level [39] . Proteins turnover that are regulated at transcriptional level shows correlation of 0.89 between protein levels and transcript abundance. However, this correlation is approximately only 0.20 for proteins regulated at the translational level [39] . These data suggest the possibility that HSP60 level can be regulated at the translational level, which could HSP60 protein expression by alveolar macrophages of control and allergic asthmatic subjects. Bronchoalveolar cells of four control subjects and four allergic asthmatic subjects were fixed with PLP-sucrose and immuncytochemistry was done using ABComplex/AP method and Fast-Red coloration with Mayer's hematoxylin counterstaining (magnification \u03eb1,000). Immunocytochemistry for HSP60 expression of (A) isotypic negative control, (B) control subjects, and (C) allergic asthmatic subjects. Results shown are representative. There was no difference in positive alveolar macrophage cell count for HSP60 between control and asthmatic subjects (90% \u03ee 5% and 90 \u03ee 4% of positive cells for control and asthmatic subjects, respectively). Fig. 3 . Protein level of HSP60 in alveolar macrophages (AM) of control and allergic asthmatic subjects. AM were purified from bronchoalveolar lavage and lysed to measure HSP60 by ELISA. Protein levels for control (gray bars) and allergic asthmatic (black bars) subjects are shown (n \u03ed 5). Data are expressed as mean \u03ee SEM values. Level of HSP60 is significantly higher (*p \u03fd 0.05) in AM of asthmatic subjects compared with controls.\n\nbe consistent with such a long half-life and could explain the discrepancy observed between mRNA and protein level in this study.\n\nHowever, according to regulatory functions of HSP60, an increase in this protein level should limit the immune response. It is surprising to observe a more than two fold increase in AM of allergic asthmatic subjects compared with controls. It is possible that the immune response triggered in asthmatic subjects induces an increase in AM HSP60 production to regulate AM functions, but that HSP60 might not be able to achieve its regulatory role in allergic asthmatic AM. However, to understand the effect of a difference in intracellular level of HSP60 in AM, functional studies need to be performed. Indeed, until now, only effects of extracellular HSP60 on immune cell functions have been observed [21] [22] [23] [24] .\n\nIn conclusion, genomic expression profiling performed in this study suggests that HSP gene family is involved in AM functions in a context of allergic asthma, and also supports a role for AM immune regulatory functions in the development of allergic asthma response. Moreover, protein level analysis targets HSP60 as a novel biomarker specific to AM activities. Obviously, it will be necessary to perform functional research to clearly determine the role and impact of the HSP60 in AM activities in allergic asthma biology."}
