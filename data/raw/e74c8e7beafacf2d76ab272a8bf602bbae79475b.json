{"title": "Jones et al. Global trends in emerging infectious diseases Supplementary Information List of Contents", "body": "A number of other studies have investigated the biological characteristics of human pathogens 1-3 (Table S2 ). Our analysis investigates the spatial, temporal and biological characteristics of the initial emergence of a disease in a human population ('an EID event') and predicts future patterns of disease emergence. As such, direct comparisons to the criteria and definitions used in 1-3 are only sometimes possible. Following 1-3 , we classify pathogens involved in an EID event taxonomically into 5 main types: (viruses -including prions), bacteria (including rickettsia), fungi, protozoa and helminthes. We also follow the definition of vector-borne pathogens (transmission by biting or mechanical transfer by arthropods) in 1-3 .\n\nHuman EID events (current paper) Table S2 . Characteristics of human pathogens compared to those involved in EID events.\n\nHowever, the definitions of zoonotic pathogens and emerging pathogens that we use are slightly different than in 1-3 . The definition previously used in 2, 3 for zoonotic pathogens follows the World Health Organization's (WHO) definition as 'diseases that are naturally transmitted between vertebrates and humans (not including vectors)'. Pathogens which recently evolved from related animal pathogens (e.g., HIV-1), but are no longer transmitted between animals and humans were not regarded as zoonotic by these papers. This definition was not useful for our analysis as we wanted to categorize the source of the first emergence event into humans -i.e., where the pathogen orginated. Our temporal and spatial data for these zoonoses therefore applies to the pathogen causing the event at the moment of transmission from animals into humans, prior to its evolution into the pathogen responsible for large scale emergence (i.e., SIV-1 for HIV-1). Our definition of zoonoses also differs from 2, 3 in that we consider only those pathogens which are thought to have emerged due to transmission from a non-human animal to human, rather than those 'naturally transmitted between these hosts', i.e., we consider the direction of the transmission important. Emerging pathogens were defined in 2, 3 (following WHO) as those that have appeared in a human population for the first time, or have occurred previously, but are increasing in incidence or expanding into areas where they had not previously been reported. We broadly follow this definition by apply these criteria to define an EID event but also apply the criteria used in [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Thus in our database, an emerging infectious disease is a disease that has recently increased in incidence, impact or geographic range. Specifically it is caused by a pathogen that has recently evolved or entered the human population for the first time, or which has occurred previously, but is increasing in incidence or expanding into an area in which it has not previously been reported, or which has significantly changed its pathological or clinical presentation. We directly compare our results (EID events) with previously published papers in .07*** -9.20*** -13.29*** -15.64*** -7.58*** Socio-economic, environmental and ecological correlates of EID events for 10 random spatial draws.
