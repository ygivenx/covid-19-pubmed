{"title": "Machine learning using intrinsic genomic signatures for rapid classification of novel pathogens: COVID-19 case study", "body": "Sarbecovirus strains, the hypothesis that COVID-19 originated from bats is deemed very 56 likely [12, 34, 36, 39, [42] [43] [44] [45] . 57 All analyses performed thus far have been alignment-based and rely on the 58 annotations of the viral genes. Though alignment-based methods have been successful in 59 finding sequence similarities, their application can be challenging in many cases [46, 47] . 60 It is realistically impossible to analyze thousands of complete genomes using 61 alignment-based methods due to the heavy computation time. Moreover, the alignment 62 demands the sequences to be continuously homologous which is not always the case. 63 Alignment-free methods [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] have been proposed in the past as an alternative to 64 address the limitations of the alignment-based methods. Comparative genomics beyond 65 alignment-based approaches have benefited from the computational power of machine 66 learning. Machine learning-based alignment-free methods have also been used 67 successfully for a variety of problems including virus classification [50] [51] [52] . An 68 alignment-free approach [50] was proposed for subtype classification of HIV-1 genomes 69 and achieved \u223c 97% classification accuracy. MLDSP [51] , with the use of a broad range 70 of 1D numerical representations of DNA sequences, has also achieved very high levels of 71 classification accuracy with viruses. Even rapidly evolving, plastic genomes of viruses 72 such as Influenza and Dengue are classified down to the level of strain and subtype, 73 respectively with 100% classification accuracy. MLDSP-GUI [52] provides an option to 74 use 2D Chaos Game Representation (CGR) [53] as numerical representation of DNA 75 sequences. CGR's have a longstanding use in species classification with identification of 76 biases in sequence composition [49, 52, 53] . MLDSP-GUI has shown 100% classification 77 accuracy for Flavivirus genus to species classification using 2D CGR as numerical 78 representation [52] . MLDSP and MLDSP-GUI have demonstrated the ability to identify 79 the genomic signatures (a species-specific pattern known to be pervasive throughout the 80 genome) with species level accuracy that can be used for sequence (dis)similarity 81 analyses. In this study, we use MLDSP [51] and MLDSP-GUI [52] with CGR as a 82 numerical representation of DNA sequences to assess the classification of COVID-19 83 from the perspective of machine learning-based alignment-free whole genome 84 comparison of genomic signatures. Using MLDSP and MLDSP-GUI, we confirm that 85 the COVID-19 belongs to the Betacoronavirus, while its genomic similarity to the 86 sub-genus Sarbecovirus supports a possible bat origin. 87 This paper shows how machine learning using intrinsic genomic signatures can 88 provide rapid alignment-free taxonomic classification of novel pathogens. Our method 89 delivers accurate classifications of COVID-19 without a priori biological knowledge, by 90 a simultaneous processing of the geometric space of all relevant viral genomes. The 91 main contributions are: 92 \u2022 Identifying intrinsic viral genomic signatures, and utilizing them for a real-time 93 and highly accurate machine learning-based classification of novel pathogen 94 sequences, such as COVID-19;\n\n\u2022 A general-purpose bare-bones approach, which uses raw DNA sequences alone and 96 does not have any requirements for gene or genome annotation;\n\n\u2022 The use of a \"decision tree\" approach to supervised machine learning (paralleling 98 taxonomic ranks), for successive refinements of taxonomic classification.\n\n\u2022 A comprehensive and \"in minutes\" analysis of a dataset of 5538 unique viral 100 genomic sequences, for a total of 61.8 million bp analyzed, with high classification 101 accuracy scores at all levels, from the highest to the lowest taxonomic rank; ignored to address possible issues arising from sequence length bias.\n\nML-DSP [51] and MLDSP-GUI [52] were used as the machine learning-based 117 alignment-free methods for complete genome analyses. As MLDSP-GUI is an extension 118 of the ML-DSP methodology, we will refer to the method hereafter as MLDSP-GUI.\n\nEach genomic sequence is mapped into its respective genomic signal (a discrete numeric 120 sequence) using a numerical representation. For this study, we use a two-dimensional 121 k-mer (oligomers of length k) based numerical representation known as Chaos Game\n\nRepresentation (CGR) [53] . respective MoDMap3D is shown in Figure 1 (a). All six classification models trained on 171 3273 sequences were used to classify (predict the label of) the 29 COVID-19 sequences. 172 All of our machine learning-based models correctly predicted and confirmed the label as 173 Riboviria for all 29 sequences ( respective MoDMap3D is shown in Figure 1 (b). All six classification models trained on 184 2779 sequences were used to classify (predict the label of) the 29 COVID-19 sequences. 185 All of our machine learning-based models predicted the label as Coronaviridae for all 29 186 sequences ( All classifiers trained on Test-1, Test-2, Test-3a, and Test-3b datasets were used to predict the labels of 29 COVID-19 viral sequences. All classifiers predicted the correct labels for all of the sequences (Riboviria when trained using Test-1, Coronaviridae when trained using Test-2, and Betacoronavirus when trained using Test-3a and Test-3b).\n\nFebruary 20, 2020 6/26 .

The third test (Test-3a) is designed to classify the COVID-19 sequences at the genus 190 level. We considered 208 Coronaviridae sequences available under four genera 191 (Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus) ( Table 1) .\n\nMLDSP-GUI with CGR at k = 7 as the numerical representation was used for the 193 classification of the dataset in Test-3a. The maximum classification accuracy of 98.1% is 194 obtained using the Linear Discriminant model and the respective MoDMap3D is shown 195 in Figure 1 (c). All six classification models trained on 208 sequences were used to 196 classify (predict the label of) the 29 COVID-19 sequences. All of our machine 197 learning-based models predicted the label as Betacoronavirus for all 29 sequences (Table 198 2). To verify that the correct prediction is not an artifact of possible bias because of 199 larger Betacoronavirus cluster, we did a secondary Test-3b with cluster size limited to 200 the size of smallest cluster (after removing the Gammacoronavirus because it just had 9 201 sequences). The maximum classification accuracy of 100% is obtained using the Linear 202 Discriminant model for Test-3b. All six classification models trained on 60 sequences 203 were used to classify the 29 COVID-19 sequences. All of our machine learning-based 204 models predicted the label as Betacoronavirus for all 29 sequences (Table 2) . This Table 3 . The maximum classification accuracy of 98.7% with CGR at k = 7 218 as the numerical representation is obtained using the Subspace Discriminant model. The 219 respective MoDMap3D is shown in Figure 2 (b). In the MoDMap3D plot from Test-5, 220 COVID-19 sequences are placed in a single distinct cluster, see Figure 2 (b). As visually 221 suggested by the MoDMap3D (Figure 2 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.932350 doi: bioRxiv preprint Betacoronavirus at k = 7 (Table 4) , which is consistent with the ML-DSP results in 250 Test-3 ( Table 2 ). The COVID-19 was then compared to all sub-genera within the 251 Betacoronavirus genus: Embecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirs and Sarbecovirus seen in 252 Figure 6 . The Spearman's rank test was again consistent with the ML-DSP results seen 253 in Table 3 , as the k-mer frequencies at k = 7 showed the highest correlation to the 254 sub-genus Sarbecovirus ( for the correlation test. By visually inspecting each hexbin scatterplot, the degree of correlation is displayed by the variation in spread between the points. Hexagonal points that are closer together and less dispersed as seen in (d) are more strongly correlated and have less deviation. Table 4 . Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (\u03c1) values from Figure 5 and 6 , for which all p-values < 10 \u22125 . The strongest correlation value was found between Betacoronavirus and Sarbecovirus when using the data sets from Test 3a from Table 2  and Test 4 from Table 3 highlighting the need for continued intervention [34, [61] [62] [63] . Still, the early COVID-19 262 genomes that have been sequenced and uploaded are over 99% similar, suggesting these 263 infections result from a recent cross-species event [12, 31, 41] .\n\nThese prior analyses relied upon alignment-based methods to identify relationships 265 between COVID-19 and other coronaviruses with nucleotide and amino acid sequence 266 similarities. When analyzing the conserved replicase domains of ORF1ab for 267 coronavirus species classification, nearly 94% of amino acid residues were identical to 268 SARS-CoV, yet overall genome similarity was only around 70%, confirming that 269 COVID-19 was genetically different [63] . Within the RdRp region, it was found that 270 another bat coronavirus, RaTG13, was the closest relative to COVID-19 and formed a 271 distinct lineage from other bat SARS-like coronaviruses [39, 41] . Other groups found 272 that two bat SARS-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, were 273 also closely related to COVID-19 [12, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] . There is a consensus that these three bat 274 viruses are most similar to COVID-19, however, whether or not COVID-19 arose from a 275 recombination event is still unknown [39] [40] [41] . 276 Regardless of the stance on recombination, current consensus holds that the 277 hypothesis of COVID-19 originating from bats is highly likely. Bats have been identified 278 as a reservoir of mammalian viruses and cross-species transmission to other mammals, 279 including humans [4, 7, 8, 10, 13, [64] [65] [66] . Prior to intermediary cross-species infection, the 280 coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were also thought to have originated in 281 bats [24, 25, 35, 68, 69] . Many novel SARS-like coronaviruses have been discovered in 282 bats across China, and even in European, African and other Asian countries [35, [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] . 283 With widespread geographic coverage, SARS-like coronaviruses have likely been present 284 in bats for a long period of time and novel strains of these coronaviruses can arise 285 through recombination [4] . Whether or not COVID-19 was transmitted directly from 286 bats, or from intermediary hosts, is still unknown, and will require identification of 287 COVID-19 in species other than humans, notably from the wet market and surrounding 288 area it is thought to have originated from [30] . While bats have been reported to have 289 been sold at the Huanan market, at this time, it is still unknown if there were 290 intermediary hosts involved prior to transmission to humans [27, 31, 34, 40, 77] . Snakes The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.932350 doi: bioRxiv preprint codon usage bias studies between viruses and their hosts [40] , however, this claim has 293 been disputed [78] . China CDC released information about environmental sampling in 294 the market and indicated that 33 of 585 samples had evidence of COVID-19, with 31 of 295 these positive samples taken from the location where wildlife booths were concentrated, 296 suggesting possible wildlife origin [79, 80] . Detection of SARS-CoV in Himalyan palm 297 civets and horseshoe bats identified 29 nucleotide sequences that helped trace the origins 298 of SARS-CoV isolates in humans to these intermediary species [13, 24, 39, 76] . Sampling 299 additional animals at the market and wildlife in the surrounding area may help elucidate 300 whether intermediary species were involved or not, as was possible with the SARS-CoV. 301 Viral outbreaks like COVID-19 demand timely analysis of genomic sequences to machine learning-based alignment-free method successfully used in the past for sequence 315 comparisons and analyses [51] . The main advantage alignment-free methodology offers 316 is the ability to analyze large datasets rapidly. In this study we confirm the taxonomy 317 of COVID-19 and, more generally, propose a method to efficiently analyze and classify a 318 novel unclassified DNA sequence against the background of a large dataset. We namely 319 use a \"decision tree\" approach (paralleling taxonomic ranks), and start with the highest 320 taxonomic level, train the classification models on the available complete genomes, test 321 the novel unknown sequences to predict the label among the labels of the training 322 dataset, move to the next taxonomic level, and repeat the whole process down to the 323 lowest taxonomic label.\n\nTest-1 starts at the highest available level and classifies the viral sequences to the 11 325 families and Riboviria realm (Table 1) . There is only one realm available in the viral 326 taxonomy, so all of the families that belong to the realm Riboviria are placed into a 327 single cluster and a random collection of 500 sequences are selected. No realm is defined 328 for the remaining 11 families. The objective is to train the classification models with the 329 known viral genomes and then predict the labels of the COVID-19 virus sequences. The 330 maximum classification accuracy score of 95% was obtained using the Quadratic SVM 331 model. This test demonstrates that MLDSP-GUI can distinguish between different viral 332 families. The trained models are then used to predict the labels of 29 COVID-19 333 sequences. As expected, all classification models correctly predict that the COVID-19 334 sequences belong to the Riboviria realm, see Table 2 . Test-2 is composed of 12 families 335 from the Riboviria, see Table 1 , and the goal is to test if MLDSP-GUI is sensitive 336 enough to classify the sequences at the next lower taxonomic level. It should be noted 337 that as we move down the taxonomic levels, sequences become much more similar to 338 one another and the classification problem becomes challenging. MLDSP-GUI is still 339 able to distinguish between the sequences within the Riboviria realm with a maximum 340 classification accuracy of 91.1% obtained using the Linear Discriminant classification 341 model. When COVID-19 sequences are tested using the models trained on Test-2, all of 342 the models correctly predict the COVID-19 sequences as Coronaviridae (Table 2) . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.03.932350 doi: bioRxiv preprint four genera (Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus), 345 see Table 1 . MLDSP-GUI distinguishes sequences at the genus level with a maximum 346 classification accuracy score of 98%, obtained using the Linear Discriminant model. This 347 is a very high accuracy rate considering that no alignment is involved and the sequences 348 are very similar. All trained classification models correctly predict the COVID-19 as 349 Betacoronavirus, see Table 2 . Test-3a has Betacoronavirus as the largest cluster and it 350 can be argued that the higher accuracy could be a result of this bias. To avoid bias, we 351 did an additional test removing the smallest cluster Gammacoronavirus and limiting the 352 size of remaining three clusters to the size of the cluster with the minimum number of 353 sequences i.e. 20 with Test-3b. MLDSP-GUI obtains 100% classification accuracy for 354 this additional test and still predicts all of the COVID-19 sequences as Betacoronavirus. 355 These tests confirm that the COVID-19 are from the genus Betacoronavirus.\n\nSequences become very similar at lower taxonomic levels (sub-genera and species). sequences as Sarbecovirus. This suggests substantial similarity between COVID-19 and 364 the Sarbecovirus sequences. Test-5 and Test-6 (see Table 3 ) are designed to verify that 365 COVID-19 sequences can be differentiated from the known species in the 366 Betacoronavirus genus. MLDSP-GUI achieved a maximum classification score of 98.7% 367 for Test-5 and 100% for Test-6 using Subspace Discriminant classification model. This 368 shows that although COVID-19 and Sarbecovirus are closer on the basis of genomic 369 similarity (Test-4), they are still distinguishable from known species. Therefore, these 370 results suggest that COVID-19 may represent a genetically distinct species of 371 Sarbecovirus. All COVID-19 virues are visually seen in MoDMap3D generated from 372 Test-5 (see Figure 2 (b)) as a closely packed cluster and it supports a fact that there is 373 99% similarity among these sequences [12, 31] . The MoDMap3D generated from the 374 Test-5 (Figure 2(b) ) visually suggests and the average distances from COVID-19 375 sequences to all other sequences confirm that the COVID-19 sequences are most 376 proximal to the RaTG13 (distance: 0.0203), followed by the bat-SL-CoVZC45 (0.0418), 377 and bat-SL-CoVZX21 (0.0428). To confirm this proximity, a UPGMA phylogenetic tree 378 is computed from the PCC-based pairwise distance matrix of sequences in Test-6, see 379 Figure 3 . The phylogenetic tree placed the RaTG13 sequence closest to the COVID-19 380 sequences, followed by the bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21 sequences. This 381 closer proximity represents the smaller genetic distances between these sequences and 382 aligns with the visual sequence relationships shown in the MoDMap3D of Figure 2 (b). 383 We further confirm our results regarding the closeness of COVID dinucleotides in their genomes, otherwise known as CG suppression [81, 82] . This feature 403 is thought to have been due to the accumulation of spontaneous deamination mutations 404 of methyl-cytosines over time [81] . As viruses are obligate parasites, evolution of viral 405 genomes is intimately tied to the biology of their hosts [83] . As host cells develop 406 strategies such as RNA interference and restriction-modification systems to prevent and 407 limit viral infections, viruses will continue to counteract these strategies [82] [83] [84] .\n\nDinucleotide composition and biases are pervasive across the genome and make up a 409 part of the organism's genomic signature [83] . These host genomes have evolutionary 410 pressures that shape the host genomic signature, such as the pressure to eliminate CG 411 dinucleotides within protein coding genes in humans [82] . Viral genomes have been 412 shown to mimic the same patterns of the hosts, including single-stranded positive-sense 413 RNA viruses, which suggests that many RNA viruses can evolve to mimic the same 414 features of their host's genes and genomic signature [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] . As genomic composition, 415 specifically in mRNA, can be used as a way of discriminating self vs non-self RNA, the 416 viral genomes are likely shaped by the same pressures that influence the host 417 genome [82] . One such pressure on DNA and RNA is the APOBEC family of enzymes, 418 members of which are known to cause G to A mutations [85] [86] [87] . While these enzymes 419 primarily work on DNA, it has been demonstrated that these enzymes can also target 420 RNA viral genomes [86] . The APOBEC enzymes therefore have RNA editing capability 421 and may help contribute to the innate defence system against various RNA viruses [85] . 422 This could therefore have a direct impact on the genomic signature of RNA viruses.\n\nAdditional mammalian mechanisms for inhibiting viral RNA have been highlighted for 424 retroviruses with the actions of zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) [81] . ZAP targets 425 CG dinucleotide sequences, and in vertebrate host cells with the CG suppression in host 426 genomes, this can serve as a mechanism for the distinction of self vs non-self RNA and 427 inhibitory consequences [81] . Coronaviruses have A/U rich and C/G poor genomes, 428 which over time may have been, in part, a product of cytidine deamination and 429 selection against CG dinucleotides [88] [89] [90] . This is consistent with the fact that bats 430 serve as a reservoir for many coronaviruses and that bats have been observed to have 431 some of the largest and most diverse arrays of APOBEC genes in mammals [66, 67] . The 432 Spearman's rank correlation data and the patterns observed in the CGR images from 433 Figure 4 , of the coronavirus genomes, including COVID-19 identify patterns such as CG 434 underepresentation, also present in vertebrate and, importantly, bat host genomes.\n\nWith human-to-human transmission confirmed and concerns for possible 436 asymptomatic transmission, there is a strong need for continued intervention to prevent 437 the spread of the virus [33, 34, [61] [62] [63] . Due to the high amino acid similarities between 438 COVID-19 and SARS-CoV main protease essential for viral replication and processing, 439 anticoronaviral drugs targeting this protein and other potential drugs have been 440 identified using virtual docking to the protease for treatment of 441 COVID-19 [29, 44, 45, [91] [92] [93] [94] . The human ACE2 receptor has also been identified as the 442 potential receptor for COVID-19 and represents a potential target for treatment [42, 43] . 443 MLDSP-GUI is an ultra-fast, alignment-free method as is evidenced by the 444 time-performance of MLDSP-GUI for Test-1 to Test-6 given in Figure 7 . MLDSP-GUI 445 took just 10.55 seconds to compute a pairwise distance matrix (including reading 3273 complete genomes). All of the tests combined (Test-1 to Test-6) are doable in This study provides an alignment-free method based on intrinsic genomic signatures 456 that can deliver highly-accurate real-time taxonomic predictions of yet unclassified new 457 sequences, ab initio, using raw DNA sequence data alone and without the need for gene 458 or genome annotation. We use this method to provide evidence for the taxonomic correlation coefficient analyses. This study suggests that such alignment-free approaches 465 to comparative genomics can be used to complement alignment-based approaches when 466 timely taxonomic classification is of the essence, such as at critical periods during novel 467 viral outbreaks.\n\nSupporting information 469 S1 "}
