{"title": "Seroepidemiological analysis of influenza pandemics in Shizuoka Prefecture and all Japan", "body": "Statistical and epidemiological analyses in weekly data of active dynamic surveillance of influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI) were carried out in Shizuoka Prefecture and all Japan for the last 17 years (1986 -2003) .\n\nFurthermore, virological, serological and genetic analyses were done with regard to (1) pathogen's information -mainly the viral subtypes (vaccine, herald and pandemic/ endemic strains) and (2) patient's information-mainly percentage (%) of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers of Shizuoka Prefectural people in order to serve the prediction of usual and new (avian) types of influenza pandemics -interpandemics in the near future in all Japan.\n\n(1) The weekly data were utilized from national and prefectural, active dynamic surveillance of influenza and ILI in 1986-2003, reported due to the new raw of infectious disease control reestablished in 1999 and 2003. (2) Several kinds of test samples from gurgled waters, pharyngeal wipes, sera and liquor derived from babies, young and school children, adults and old men in clinical institutions in Shuizuoka Prefecture were stocked at 4 jC. \n\n(A) From statistical and epidemiological analyses in weekly data of active dynamic surveillance of ILI in Shizuoka Prefecture and all Japan for the last 17 years (1986 -2003), differences were found in geographical (prefectural), annual and seasonal (winter and others) and age (generation) distributions [1 -3] . During the past 17 years, with the exception of a few seasons, the influenza pandemics usually started at about week 50 every year, showing the incidences over 1.0 patient per clinical institution, reached the peak at about week 5 of the next year, and ended over 10-15th week in Shizuoka Prefecture as well as all Japan [1] [2] [3] . Two biggest pandemics due to A/H3N2 subtype were seen in the 1989/1990 and 1997/1998 seasons, showing over 1 million (10\u00c210 5 ) patients with ILI in all Japan. Three bigger pandemics of A/H3N2 subtype were also seen in the 1992/1993, 1994/ 1995 and 1998/1999 seasons, showing over 8\u00c210 5 patients [1 -3] .\n\n(B) The following results [1] [2] [3] were clarified from viral and serological analyses of influenza pandemics in Japan:\n\n(1) By viral and genetic analyses of pandemic subtypes of influenza in Shizuoka Prefecture and all Japan in three recent years (1998 -2000) , A/H3N2 and B subtype strains were isolated as one peak with shoulder in 1998/1999 season, however A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 subtype strains were isolated at the same time as a single peak, namely without viral interference, in 1999/2000 season [1 -3] . \n\n(1) The early detection of herald strains like B/Shizuoka/1/98 strain in interpandemic periods every year is very important for vaccine-candidated strains and those productive supply in the following seasons [1] [2] [3] .\n\n(2) Low anti-HA antibody (HI) titers under 10 in massive prevention suggest that the next pandemics due to new avian subtypes, e.g., H5N1 in Hong Kong, H7N7 in the Netherlands and other highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) also could be predicted for a world-scale outbreak in the near future among unvaccinated population [1] [2] [3] .
