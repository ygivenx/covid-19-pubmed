{"title": "ROTAVIRUS INFECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH DIARRHOEA IN CALVES IN EGYPT", "body": "In recent years, research has done much to increase knowledge of the aetiology of diarrhoea in newborn calves. The presence of rotavirus and coronavirus has been confirmed in the faeces of a high proportion of diarrhoeic calves (Stair et al., 1972; Woode and Bridger, 1975; Scherrer et al., 1976) .\n\nIn the present work, attempts were made to isolate and identify rotavirns for \n\nA modified method after Babiuk et al. (1977) was used, in which the virus isolation from faeces was achieved by treating a 1/10 dilution of faeces with 100 ~g of trypsin/ml at 37~ for 15 minutes. The faeces were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes and the supernatant was treated with antibiotics and inoculated on to BEK cells. After a 2-hour adsorption period, Hanks's solution plus 2% horse serum and 10 ~g of trypsin/ml were added. Cultures were returned to the 37~ incubator.\n\nThe presence of the virus was detected by cytopathogenic effects (CPE). The degeneration was demonstrated by the cells rounding, becoming spindle-shaped and detaching from the glass. The degenerated cells were subjected to two freezethaw cycles. The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes and virus present in the supernatant fluid was used as stock virus.\n\nThe tenth virus passage of the isolate, designated by us SH-361, was titrated on BEK cells and the titres were calculated according to Reed and Muench (1938) .\n\nThe method described by Mebus et al. (1971) \n\nAntigens for use in CFT were suspensions of the tissue culture-adapted virus isolates. These antigens were titrated by the chessboard technique against the specific antiserum of rotavirus in microtitre plates as described by Thouless et al. (1977) . The 105 serum samples obtained from the slaughter house were also assayed by this method.\n\nThe test was performed on slides coated with I% agarose in 0.15 M NaCI. One central well and six peripheral wells (4 mm in diameter) were punched about 1 cm apart. The central well was filled with the specific antiserum and the peripheral wells were filled with the isolated viruses. The slides were left at 4~ overnight, then read for the presence of a precipitin line.\n\nThe isolated SH-361 virus was diluted to obtain 100 TCID~o/0.2 ml. The sera were diluted in two-fold steps. Virus and serum dilutions were mixed in equal volumes and incubated at 37~ for I hour. Each mixture (0.2 ml) was inoculated into four cell culture tubes.\n\nThe number of positive culture tubes was determined by microscopic examination and 5~% SN titres were calculated by the method of Reed and Muench (1938) .\n\nThe technique of Feldman and Wang (1961) was employed; 2~% v/v chloroformvirus mixture was prepared and shaken for 15 minutes, then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 minutes. The supernatant fluid was removed and used for virus titration.\n\npH stability\n\nThe stability of the virus in acid and alkaline pH was determined by the procedures described by Borden et al. (1971) .\n\nTen isolates from a total of 25 faecal samples were found to give CPE after propagation on BEK cells in the presence of trypsin. The virus produced CPE By the fifth passage, the CPE had shortened to h days pi, when the cells became rounded and spindle-shaped and sometimes produced filamentous processes. The cells then detached from the glass, became shrunken and floated in the media.\n\nWith immunofluorescent staining, three isolates gave specific fluorescence using the antiserum of rotavirus. The specific fluorescence was confined to the cytoplasm and was detected as early as 2h hours pi, reaching the maximum at 72 hours pi. Bovine virus diarrhoea antisera and normal control sera gave negative results.\n\nOne of the isolates from those showing positive reactions with the immunofluorescence test and CFT, and which gave regular and prominent CPE, was further propagated for ten passages and titrated to give 106.25 TCIDso/0.2 ml. This (Table I) . SH-361\n\nshowed resistance to treatment with chloroform and pH treatment (Table II) .\n\nIn the survey on the sera obtained from 105 calves at the slaughter house, using CFT, 18 (17.1~) were found to have antibodies to rotavirus (Table III) .\n\nHalf of the positive samples had titres ranging from 1/32 to 1/64.\n\nIn Egypt, mortality in calves due to microbial agents is very high and ranges between 25% and 3~.\n\nIn the present study, ten virus strains were isolated from 25 faecal samples taken from newly born calves with severe diarrhoea, on a Government farm of buffaloes and Friesian cattle near Cairo.\n\nThese isolates grew readily on BEK cells in the presence of trypsin giving a clear CPE similar to the results obtained by Babiuk et al. (1977) who emphasized that trypsin could not only enhance the spread of rotavirus but also increase the number of infectious particles in a virus preparation.\n\nThree of the virus isolates were passaged in BEK and the CPE shortened from 6 days to 4 days pi at the fifth passage.\n\nSerological identification of the three isolates was carried out for two strains at the fifth passages and for the other at the tenth passage, in comparison with a standard reference strain. The results of immunofluorescent staining, CFT and AGP, and also SNT in the case of strain SH-361, indicated that the three viruses were rotaviruses and closely related to the French reference rotavirus strain (Scherrer et al., 1976) .
