{"title": "Diversity of Archaea Domain in Cuatro Cienegas Basin: Archaean Domes 1 2", "body": "Introduction 46 The Archaea domain is an essential but usually rare, component of different ecosystems, not only 47 extreme ones as originally suggested [1-4], for instance, they are critical in hydrological systems 48\n\nand their abundance and composition changes according to identifiable spatial and temporal scales 49\n\n[5-7]. Archaea is represented in 26 phyla [8] , most of which are novel and some lineages include 50 only one species of uncultivated strains that have been assembled through metagenomics [9, 10] . 51\n\nIndeed, a current challenge in their study is the isolation and cultivation of novel Archaea, since 52 they are usually restricted to extreme conditions. Traditional culture-dependent approaches have 53 underestimated abundance and diversity of Archaea, making it hard to achieve an accurate 54 understanding of their role in microbial communities in an ecological niche [11] . Nevertheless, a 55 successful co-cultivation of an Asgard archaeon associated with bacteria was reported after a long-56 term methane-fed bioreactor culture of deep marine sediments, demonstrating that non-traditional 57 cultures of untapped environments are reservoirs of Archaea genetic and functional diversity yet to 58 be uncovered [12] . Another challenge is to fully comprehend their phylogenetic association, given 59 the limited genetic information available for some Archaea phyla. 60\n\nIn the last decade, our knowledge on the diversity and taxonomy of Archaea has 61 substantially improved [13] due to the rise of metagenomics and increasing available archaeal 62 genomes. The Archaea tree is being rapidly filled up with new branches, demonstrating that the 63\n\nAfter obtaining the necessary collecting permits and adequate equipment, sample collection of the 165 AD was conducted in early April 2016. By then, the AD site was starting to dry, and the mat 166 exhibited a morphology in which a photosynthetic upper layer became evident in the dome-like 167 structure, while the interior of the domes maintained a wet black layer (Fig. 1b) shown) after four years revealed that during the dry seasons, AD microbial mats are active even if 171 they do not produce domes. Moreover, it is only after heavy rains dissolve the salts, that domes 172 emerge due to the elastic nature of the mats, producing its typical sulfur-like smell. We have 173 observed the same phenomena up to last exploration September 2019. 174\n\nThe AD mats sampled on April 10 th , 2016, looked different from the original observation 175 (less than 3 weeks earlier). What firstly seemed like a shallow pond, was already drying up when 176 the first sample was collected for sequencing (AD1), and the dense salty liquid started to turn into a 177 salty-white-carbonate crust. As can be seen in Figure 1C The microbial community of the AD is approximately 200 m away from the most described, 182 stromatolite-rich and iconic blue pond from Rancho Pozas Azules, but physicochemical conditions 183 found in the AD are extreme in salinity and higher in pH (Table 1) . While Blue Pond pH is 7.9 [62, 184 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. AD2, and AD3, were 3.6%, 5% and 5% respectively. The binning of the metagenomic reads 194\n\nshowed that the archaeal community in the AD metagenomes was dominated by Euryarchaeota-195 halophilic archaeal lineages. Sequences from Crenarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, Korarchaeota, and 196 Nanoarchaeota phyla were also retrieved (Fig. 2) . All five phyla comprise 15 classes dominated by 197 members of Halobacteria and Methanomicrobia classes (Fig. 2) , both important groups of the 198 Euryarchaeota phylum. Additionally, 25 orders, 36 families, 93 genera, and 230 species (defined as 199\n\nOTUs at 97% cutoff) were detected in the three metagenomes. It is noteworthy that from those 230 200\n\nOTUs, a total of 24 could not be further classified (Supp. Fig.2) . 201\n\nTo depict the extent of the biodiversity present within the AD metagenomes, we retrieved 202 from the marker databases the 16S rRNA sequences corresponding to the species identified by 203 MetaPhlAn2. We used these sequences to reconstruct a phylogeny (Fig. 3) . Several sequences 204 belonging to the same genera were omitted to avoid redundancy; others without a full-length marker 205 sequence were also omitted. The phylogenetic reconstruction displays 213 sequences, 169 206 belonging to our mining and 44 are reference sequences. Five phyla were represented, that gave rise 207 to 11 major clades. 208 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/766709 doi: bioRxiv preprint Alpha diversity was calculated using Shannon, Simpson and Chao indexes (Table 2a) . 209\n\nCompared to the fluctuations observed in several bacterial studies in CCB [65], the archaeal 210 diversity did not show drastic changes through sampling seasons (Table 2a) . Moreover, 90% of the 211 total archaeal richness (OTUs at 97% cutoff level) is shared among the three samples. This is 212 confirmed by the Beta diversity estimates at species level (Table 2 b ). Overall, richness evaluated at 213 the other different taxonomic levels (i.e., using the 15 classes, the 25 orders, and/or the 36 families) 214\n\nof Archaea, remain similar in the three metagenomes. 215\n\nIn accordance with the Archaea's stable core hypothesis for the AD, the species 216 accumulation curve shows that the inventory for every sample (AD1, AD2, AD3) was very similar. 217\n\nThe expected diversity using the presence and absence for every identified OTUs in the 218 metagenomic analysis increased very little with the addition of each sample. Therefore, OTU 219 rarefaction curve with data from the 3 samples is asymptotic (Suppl. Fig. 1) . 220 221\n\nConsidering that 229 of the 230 identified archaeal OTUs are each present at relative abundances 223 below 0.1%, we applied a strict threshold of 0.01% of relative abundance [66] to identify what we 224 consider strictly rare archaeal taxa. Consequently, within the AD mats, 50 archaeal OTUs were 225 defined to be strictly rare (each covering less than <0.01% of the total reads). Interestingly, such 226 abundance profiles along the three sampling times show that 11 OTUs of the strictly rare Archaea 227 taxa seem to be conditionally rare [67] , that is, these taxa maintain their lower abundance in only 228 one sample, and reach higher (while still rare <0.1%) abundances in other samples (Fig. 3A) . This 229 suggests that while the rest of the Archaea community is relatively stable, the strictly rare biosphere 230 is dynamic and depends on the proper conditions to prosper. On the other hand, we found that 39 231 strictly rare Archaea OTUs were not detected in at least one metagenome (Fig. 3B) . These taxa 232 .

Those abundances are remarkable for such a 241 small sampled area (cm 2 ), but also when compared to other sites in CCB and the world (see Table  242 1) [69-71]. After profiling the community at several taxonomic levels, it was observed that an 243 archaean community core remained almost intact in time (April 2016-February 2017). This 244 provided evidence for stability behind the construction of the domes (our null hypothesis). 245\n\nNevertheless, within that core, the diversity and proportions of rare archaeal taxa increased or 246 diminished across seasons, exhibiting a dynamic in the AD which might be playing a role for their 247 functioning along different environmental conditions. 248 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/766709 doi: bioRxiv preprint communities that cohesively survive despite the changing harsh abiotic factors, like those 256 experienced along their very long evolutionary trajectory [21] . We believe, that the microbial mat of 257 AD is not an exception in CCB, however, the observation that raised scientific interest to study 258 these particular mats was precisely its extreme conditions of pH and salinity, besides their 259 interesting \"architectural\" shape. Notwithstanding, analogue extreme environmental conditions 260 have been reported in other archaeal rich microbial mats before, for instance in the Desert of 261\n\nAtacama or the human made salterns in Guerrero Negro, both stable environments (Table 1) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/766709 doi: bioRxiv preprint the Salar de Llamara [79], and above 90% of 16S rRNA of sequences amplified in a highly lithified 279 mat in Laguna de Tebenchique, in the Salar de Atacama [69] . Nevertheless, all these Archaea-rich 280 sites, display lower diversity [80] than our small (cm 2 ) seasonal AD. Given the extremely small 281 site, our 230 different species (at 97% cutoff) and 5 different phyla can be considered high. 282\n\nNoticeably, our 24 unclassified archaeal OTUs (Supp. Figure 2) , constitute an interesting challenge 283 for systematics and biodiscovery. 284\n\nThe CCB is well known for its outstanding microbial diversity and unique endemic lineages 285 The estimated \u03b1 and \u03b2 diversity indexes for the AD samples suggest resilience of the 297 community, which is expected to be largely influenced by species diversity, as explained by the 298 insurance hypothesis [83] . Our data shows a slight increase in archaeal diversity and richness 299 indexes in dry seasons compared to the sample from the wet season (Table 2) , possibly because that 300 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/766709 doi: bioRxiv preprint is the usual state of the AD site, since annual precipitations are not heavy enough to dissolve the 301 salts and change the ecology of the mats (Supp . Table 1 ) 302\n\nAnother plausible explanation for an increased abundance and diversity in the Archaea 303 domain in the AD mats is the killing-the-winner hypothesis [84], that proposes a negative 304 frequency-dependent selection, in which bacterial types are affected by viral pressure, promoting 305 the survival and viability of rare types, and thus maintaining high diversity. Viral reads in our AD 306 metagenomes represent a relative abundance ranging from 23.3% to 31.6%, which is remarkably 307 high compared to other metagenomes, and even higher than typical virus-rich environments, such as 308 we considered it was important to explore rarity within the Archaea community. 316\n\nBy defining a \"strictly rare\" biosphere as the taxa with relative abundances below 0.01%, we 317 found 50 archaeal OTUs. Within this group, 11 OTUs seem to be conditionally rare [67], 318 maintaining their lower abundance in only one sampling time (the wet month), and reaching higher 319 abundances in both dry samplings (Fig. 3A) . Their dynamics lead us to speculate that those rare 320\n\nOTUs from the AD, along with the more abundant OTUs, could be benefiting of a saltier 321 environment or drier conditions. In both cases, it is noticeable that although archaeal richness and 322 overall abundance does not change much among samples, it is the rare (the one driven by 323 .

Among this rare biosphere, some taxa were found to be transiently rare (i.e., absent in one or 326 two of the samples) comprising 39 OTUs (Fig. 3B) . We suggest that this type of rarity should be 327 driven at least in part by stochastic processes, such as passive dispersal of lineages temporarily 328 recruited from microbial seed bank, or due to immigration [88] . As an example, nine rare 329 unclassified taxa that were not present or were in very low abundances in the initial sample AD1, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/766709 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nHalophiles and methanogens species were highly abundant in the AD, representing > 50% of the 349 total Archaeal diversity. The relationship between halophiles and methanogens is well known, The most abundant OTUs in the analyzed AD metagenomes were similar to 364\n\nMethanohalophilus mahii, a halophilic-methanogen Archaea described as a non-marine 365 methanogen, adapted to hypersaline environments; its metabolism requires 1.0-2.5 M NaCl for 366 optimal growth and methanogenesis, using methanol and methylamines as substrates [ \n\nSumming to the hypothesis of magmatic influence to the microbial community of this unusual site, 383\n\nCrenarchaeota taxa are consistently present in the AD mat. These include thermophilic genera such 384\n\nas Thermoproteus, Caldivirga, Ignicoccus, Sulfolobus, Pyrolobus, among others. In addition, 385\n\nThaumarchaeota members were detected, such as \"Candidatus Nitrososphaera gargensis\", 386 \n\nThe Archaean Domes microbial mats at the oasis Cuatro Ci\u00e9negas Basin, were recently discovered 409 as a hypersaline extreme site. In these mats we uncovered through metagenomic analysis, one of 410 the highest diversities registered so far in the Archaea domain, considering the site's geographic 411 small scale. Most of the 230 OTUs observed in this unusual small shallow temporal pond, are part 412 of the rare biosphere and form a stable core community. Within this core, we observed halophiles 413 and methanogens, but also spatially unexpected archaeal taxa, that thrive under high salt 414 concentrations. We also observed a transient rare biosphere that appears to be enriched under dry 415 environmental conditions, suggesting seasonal dynamics shaping community assemblage. 416\n\nIn order to explore this group of taxonomic the unclassified rare taxa more carefully, we are in the 417 process of analyzing more metagenomes in different seasons as well as manipulating the 418 .

More sequencing effort in deep sediment cores will 419 also help to look for the deep anaerobic biosphere, as well as eliminate blind spots in phylogeny of 420 unclassified Archaea, and this will require differential coverage binning approach [109] using all 421 available metagenomes from the AD to describe phylogenetic novelty within AD at CCB. 422\n\nThis highly diverse ecosystem within Cuatro Cienegas, Mexico, arises as an attractive novel 423 site for evolutionary, ecological, astrobiological and bioprospecting studies. The AD is, so far, the 424 most diverse microbial community found in CCB, despite its extreme conditions. Since this area is 425 being subjected to intense water exploitation by agricultural practices, and desiccation has become a 426 common occurrence in numerous ponds, it is priority for our research group to keep investigating 427 the ecology of the adaptation of this highly diverse archaeal-rich microbial communities to 428 fluctuating temperature and rainfall conditions, while working with shareholders on changes in 429 policy of water usage. 430\n\nNow proven as an archaeal rich extreme site, CCB is once more attracting attention as an 431 astrobiological model [38, 41] . The Archaean Domes not only can take us further back into the \"lost 432 world\" but it is also a site that keeps providing evidences and new keys to understand how \"life 433 cycle\" could have been originated on Earth, or (will be) possible on, for example, Mars. 434 435\n\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest regarding the publication of this paper.
