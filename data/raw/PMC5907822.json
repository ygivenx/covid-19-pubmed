{"title": "Comparison of outpatient medically attended and community\u2010level influenza\u2010like illness\u2014New York City, 2013\u20102015", "body": "Surveillance for influenza\u2010like illness (ILI) activity in the United States traditionally relies on reports of medically attended visits, including outpatient, and emergency room visits and hospitalizations.1 The majority of ILI is mild and self\u2010limited, and many patients never seek care in a medical setting.2 Surveillance for medically attended ILI misses cases of non\u2010medically attended ILI in the community and underestimates the true prevalence of ILI in the population. Understanding community ILI can shed light on the full burden of influenza. Furthermore, primary care clinics, a common setting for outpatient ILI surveillance, may not adequately capture cases who could seek care in other settings, such as emergency departments or urgent care clinics. In addition, systems that focus on medically attended ILI may have other biases (eg, access to care) and delays associated with care seeking that may affect sensitivity of testing and may not reflect influenza and other respiratory virus activity in the broader community.3, 4, 5 A comparison between community surveillance and outpatient medically attended ILI surveillance systems could help to determine how well medically attended surveillance systems reflect respiratory viral activity in the community.\n\nCommunity surveillance for ILI in the United States has been performed periodically in several cohort studies in various small geographic areas6, 7, 8, 9; broader scale community surveillance is generally cost prohibitive. The Mobile Surveillance for Acute Respiratory Infections and Influenza\u2010Like Illness in the Community (MoSAIC) Study is one recent prospective household\u2010based cohort study established in 2012, in a neighborhood in New York City to obtain community\u2010level incidence of influenza and other respiratory viruses.8\n\n\nIn 2009, New York City, along with other participating sites, began the Influenza Incidence Surveillance Project (IISP). IISP is designed to determine the incidence of medically attended ILI and the proportion of ILI attributable to influenza and other respiratory diseases using provider estimates of patient populations.10\n\n\nUsing these two systems in the single geographic region of New York City, we sought to compare symptoms as well as the frequency, proportion, and seasonal distribution of respiratory pathogens associated with ILI between individuals with medically attended ILI and broader community\u2010level ILI across three influenza seasons to better understand how current ILI surveillance in medical clinics reflects activity seen at the community level.\n\nThe MoSAIC study methods have been described previously.8 Briefly, MoSAIC is a CDC\u2010funded community\u2010based study which performs surveillance for acute respiratory illness (ARI), including influenza\u2010like illness (ILI), in a neighborhood in New York City year\u2010round with the goal to assess ARI and ILI rates and etiology in the community. The cohort consists of approximately 250 households and is a primarily Latino population. Demographic information is collected upon enrollment. Households receive twice\u2010weekly text messages, asking if anyone has runny nose, congestion, sore throat, cough, body aches, or fever and report either \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Home visits are performed by research staff to obtain a nasal swab from any participants meeting the ARI criteria (2 symptoms including fever, runny nose/congestion, sore throat, cough, and/or myalgia) with symptoms lasting < 5 days and who are still symptomatic. The ARI criteria for infants (less than 12 months of age) also include runny nose/congestion alone. Respiratory swabs are analyzed in a research laboratory using a BioFire FilmArray multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (BioFire Diagnostics LLC, Salt Lake City, UT) detecting influenza A virus (H1, H1N1pdm09, and H3), influenza B virus, adenovirus, coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43), enteroviruses/rhinoviruses, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) types 1\u20104, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis. Further information on symptoms and care\u2010seeking behaviors is collected by interview at illness end. We limited our analysis to episodes meeting ILI criteria (fever with cough or sore throat) for appropriate comparison to ILI within IISP.\n\nThe CDC's IISP is a population\u2010based outpatient surveillance network operating year\u2010round, for syndromic ILI with systematic laboratory testing for influenza viruses, including three primary care clinics in New York City.10 Since 2009, participating clinics report the weekly number of ILI and all\u2010cause visits. Patients with symptom onset within 7 days of presentation are included, and ILI is defined as fever with cough or sore throat among patients \u2265 2 years of age, and fever with \u22651 of cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, or rhinorrhea among children < 2 years of age. Nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swabs are collected from the first 10 ILI patients of each week and tested at the NYC Public Health Laboratory for influenza using the CDC real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assay. Specimens collected from October 2011 through August 2014 were further tested for respiratory pathogens by the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Center using Taqman Array Card11, 12 (TAC, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) that included influenza A virus (H1, H1N1pdm09, and H3), influenza B virus, adenovirus, coronaviruses (229E, HKu1, NL63, OC43), enterovirus, HMPV, HPIV types 1\u20104, RSV, rhinovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella pneumophila, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes. Discordant results in influenza virus testing between the CDC PCR testing kits and Taqman testing were assumed positive by any assay. Specimens collected from August 2014 through May 2015 were also tested using the Luminex xTAG\u00ae Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP; Luminex Diagnostics, Toronto, Canada) for RSV, HPIV types 1\u20104, HMPV, rhino/enteroviruses (non\u2010distinguishing target), and adenovirus.\n\nA retrospective analysis of MoSAIC and IISP and surveillance data collected from January 2013 to May 2015 was performed. Included cases were those in persons with symptom onset between morbidity and mortality weekly report (MMWR) weeks 40 through 20 (approximately early October through mid\u2010May) of each influenza season. We limited comparisons to viral pathogens common to the Taqman, Biofire, and Luminex assays, specifically influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenovirus, coronaviruses, enteroviruses/rhinoviruses, HMPV, HPIV types 1\u20104, and RSV. Descriptive analyses were conducted on ILI episodes reported from the MoSAIC and NYC IISP site populations for demographic characteristics of age, gender, and whether participants had received the seasonal influenza vaccine at least 14 days prior to illness onset. Episodes in a single individual that were at least 14 days apart were included as separate illness episodes. Symptoms reported in MoSAIC and IISP populations were compared using a set of log\u2010binomial regression models adjusted for age to estimate the relative risk of individual symptoms among persons with ILI reported through community\u2010level surveillance compared with medical provider surveillance. A second set of age\u2010adjusted log\u2010binomial regression models was used to estimate the relative prevalence of individual pathogens detected in persons with ILI through MoSAIC compared to IISP. Due to incomplete data, vaccination was not adjusted for. A subset analysis was performed comparing MoSAIC participants who sought care to IISP participants. Correlation coefficients were calculated for seasonal distribution of influenza and RSV viruses between the two surveillance systems. Statistical significance was set at .05, and analyses were performed using SAS (v 9.3) software.\n\nDuring the surveillance period, 334 households were followed by MoSAIC with an estimated 4.8 persons per household. The estimated population under surveillance among the three IISP sites was 20 368. A total of 512 MoSAIC and 669 IISP participants meeting the ILI case definition over the study period were tested by RT\u2010PCR (Table 1). The ILI cases identified through IISP had a slightly higher proportion of adults compared with MoSAIC cases, while the MoSAIC cases had a higher proportion of females. Forty percent of MoSAIC participants with ILI sought care for their illness. Of those who did seek care, most (81%) sought care in a primary care setting, similar to clinics represented in IISP, while the remaining cases were seen in an emergency department, urgent care clinic, or retail clinic (Table 1). Influenza vaccination data were reported for 351 (69%) of MoSAIC participants and 421 (63%) of IISP participants. Of these, 160 (46%) of the MoSAIC participants and 118 (28%) of IISP participants had received a seasonal influenza vaccine at least 14 days prior to the reported illness episode. ILI was associated with referral for hospitalization for one (0.2%) participant in the MoSAIC group and 2 (0.8%) participants in the IISP group. Median time from symptom onset to date of testing was 2 days for both MoSAIC and IISP.\n\nWhile all participants included in this analysis met the case definition of ILI (fever and cough or sore throat), there were significant differences in symptoms reported by participants in MoSAIC as compared with participants in IISP (Table 2). Differences persisted even after adjusting for age; ILI cases in MoSAIC were more likely to report rhinorrhea (81% vs 62%, P < .01) and less likely to report sore throat (47% vs 61%, P < .01) or myalgia (23% vs 46%, P < .01) compared with those in IISP. To further explore if these difference were due to care\u2010seeking behavior, we examined reported symptoms among only MoSAIC cases that reported seeking care for their illness and found that differences compared with the IISP group persisted (Table 2).\n\nOverall, 324 (63%) of 512 MoSAIC ILI cases and 468 (70%) of 669 IISP cases were positive for at least one of the pathogens tested and included in the analysis. The seasonal distribution of influenza A and influenza B viruses by week were similar between MoSAIC and IISP with correlation coefficients of .54 and .61, respectively (Figure 1). Distribution of peaks of RSV detection and seasonality was less well defined in the two groups with a correlation coefficient of \u2212.01 (Figure 1).\n\nInfluenza A virus and rhinovirus/enterovirus were the most frequently detected pathogens in both MoSAIC and IISP, although percentages varied (Table 3). Influenza A and B viruses were less frequently detected in MoSAIC compared with IISP (14% and 8% in MoSAIC; 34% and 14% in IISP, adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 0.4 and 0.5, respectively). HMPV and RSV detections were more frequently detected in MoSAIC than IISP (5.3% and 5.9% in MoSAIC; 3.1% and 3.3% in IISP, aRR 1.8 and 1.8, respectively).\n\nTo examine if these differences in proportions were due to care seeking, we examined detection of viral pathogens among only MoSAIC participants who reported seeking care for ILI with IISP data and observed similar differences in the trends of viral detections (Table 3). Influenza A and B viruses were still more frequently detected in IISP (13% and 9% among care seeking in MoSAIC participants; 34% and 14% in IISP participants, aRR 0.4 and 0.6, respectively). HMPV and RSV remained more frequent among care\u2010seeking MoSAIC participants compared with IISP (8.4% and 7.9% among care seeking in MoSAIC; 3.1% and 3.3% in IISP, aRR 2.6 and 2.2, respectively).\n\nDifferences were also seen by age group (Table 4). Detection of any virus among older adults (\u226550 years) was higher in IISP. Among children < 5 years of age, influenza A and B were detected more frequently in IISP compared with MoSAIC (35% vs 4.3%, and 7% vs 4%, respectively), whereas RSV was detected more frequently in the MoSAIC population (12% vs 4%, respectively). Similarly, among children 5\u201017 years of age, influenza A and B were detected more frequently in IISP compared with MoSAIC (34% vs 19%, and 26% vs 10%, respectively), although RSV was detected was similar. The frequency of detection for most viruses was more similar between the MoSAIC and IISP populations as age increased. The frequency of detection for most viruses was more similar between the MoSAIC and IISP as age increased. Influenza A remained higher in IISP throughout.\n\nOur analysis had several limitations. Firstly, we restricted to an ILI definition to focus on influenza, however, may not be optimal for the other viral pathogens tested. Our objective was to compare the pathogens detected within the context of ILI between the two systems rather than the full burden of all pathogens. Data on vaccination were incomplete in both IISP and MoSAIC, limiting our ability to control for vaccination in the analysis. In addition, we did not take possible household clustering into account among MoSAIC participants who were living in the same residence.\n\nSurveillance through community cohorts can more fully capture local incidence and etiology of ILI and has the potential to provide further information beyond what is capable in medically attended surveillance, such as transmissibility8, 19, 20, 21 and may add to our understanding of the full burden of influenza. While the timing of influenza and other virus detections were captured equally well in community and outpatient surveillance, the proportions of viruses detected varied between the community and outpatient clinics. There may be local geographic and/or social mixing differences affecting incidence of circulating viruses at a very local level and outpatient surveillance across more clinics may better reflect viral circulation in the larger community. Community and medically attended surveillance are valuable and complementary for understanding full ILI incidence, etiology, and burden.\n\nThe contents of this article are solely the responsibility of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official view of the Association of Public Health Laboratories or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."}
