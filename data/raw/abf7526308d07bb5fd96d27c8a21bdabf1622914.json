{"title": "Series Emerging respiratory tract infections 1 Surveillance for emerging respiratory viruses", "body": "The emergence of new human viral diseases aff ecting the respiratory tract continues to threaten global public health security. On March 12, 2003, WHO issued a global alert for an emerging and yet unknown illness that was subsequently known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 1 SARS-CoV caused more than 8000 cases and 800 deaths in over 30 countries with a substantial economic impact. 2 Since then, several other viral respiratory pathogens (table 1) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] have emerged including avian infl uenza (H5N1, H7N9, H10N8), variant infl uenza A H3N2 virus, human adenovirus-14, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Soon after the discovery of SARS, additional coronaviruses were also identifi ed: corona virus NL63 and coronavirus HKU1. 3, 4 Most infl uenza A epidemics occur in January, February, and March. However, outbreaks of infl uenza A Beijing/32/92 H3N2 in 1993 and Fujian/411/2002 H3N2 in 2003 happened in November and December. 20 In an analysis of 335 emerging infectious diseases from 1940 to 2004, most (60%) were zoonoses and 25% were viruses, and the study showed an increase in events over time. 21 In this Series paper, we review worldwide active surveillance systems for emerging and re-emerging respiratory viruses. We identify the rapid and early identifi cation systems to allow early control measures to be put in place to prevent the spread of these pathogens. We also review the work of WHO Global Infl uenza Surveillance Network (GISN), Global Infl uenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), and the network of national infl uenza centres and laboratories.\n\nSevere acute respiratory infection (SARI) is defi ned as fever of at least 100\u00baF (37\u00b78\u00b0C) or self-reported fever, and either a cough or a sore throat, and hospital admission. 22 An infl uenza-like illness (ILI) is defi ned as acute illness with fever greater than 38\u00b0C, and cough or sore throat. 22 \n\nSurveillance of emerging and re-emerging respiratory viruses aims for rapid and early identifi cation and \n\nThe goals of surveillance are to monitor when the infl uenza season begins and ends, to characterise the types and subtypes of circulating strains, to monitor the clinical severity of illness, and to detect the emergence of any novel or reassortant viruses. This information also helps in selecting future vaccine strains. The surveillance also monitors the emergence of any viral resistance. 27 The basic goals of infl uenza surveillance include description of the epidemiology of seasonal infl uenza and burden of disease, provision of isolates for identifi cation of viruses and monitoring of resistance, and provision of country-specifi c data for programme planning and preparedness. After the reemergence of highly-pathogenic infl uenza A H5N1 in 2004, another objective was to provide an early warning for outbreaks of novel infl uenza or agents of SARI in human beings or the circulation of a potentially new pandemic pathogen. The main aim of pandemic surveillance is the early recognition of the emergence of a novel virus so that control measures can be instituted. However, once a pandemic has begun, surveillance should switch to monitoring of the epidemiology, the characteristics of the virus, the eff ect of prevention and control measures, and the progression of the pandemic. 28\n\nOne of the objectives of surveillance for SARI and ILI caused by infl uenza is the detection of early warning signs for the emergence of any novel infl uenza virus or respiratory virus with pandemic potential in human beings. The important functions of early warning surveillance systems are many. The early warning system is built to detect events with potential public health threat across international borders, to verify detected events, to assess the risk that an event will have global eff ect, to report such risk within 48 h of the event determination according to the International Health Regulations, and to work with WHO to establish any public health emergency of international concern. 29 For early warning systems to work, specifi c triggers or signal criteria are needed for immediate reporting of possible occurrence of a single or multiple cases; such cases might be the initial indicators of the emergence of a novel respiratory virus with a pandemic potential such as H5N1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). SARIs or pneumonia in health-care workers might serve as important signal events that the virus has acquired the ability to spread to human beings, as seen in the SARS epidemic. Examples of events that might signal human-to-human transmission of an emerging\n\nHantavirus pulmonary syndrome, sin nombre virus 16 Series respiratory disease include clusters of SARI in people with social connections within a 2 week period, pneumonia in health-care workers, or people with a social or occupational connection. In addition, any change in the epidemiology of SARI cases, with a shift in the age distribution, an increase in mortality, or an increase in the number of cases, might signal the circulation of a new respiratory pathogen. 30, 31 Monitoring for signals of increased activity\n\nWhen the weekly infl uenza rates exceed the seasonal infl uenza threshold this increase would signal the start of a new infl uenza season. 32 For signal detection, the model built should have autoregressive components, seasonal trends, other trends, and covariates to predict the number of cases beyond expected for a specifi c day. However, monitoring of ILI and SARI should take into account the trends in any existing data and not wait to have a defi nite signal of increased activity.\n\nThe adaptation of emerging respiratory viruses to human beings might occur suddenly with widespread infection or more gradually with infection of an at-risk population. The exposure of an at-risk population to a common source results in a spillover of viruses into people. Once these viruses have gained a sustained transmission from human-to-human with an R 0 of 1 or more, in certain conditions an epidemic can result. 33 Monitoring of the rate at which R 0 increases serves as a marker for impending epidemic. 34 -36 For accurate estimates of R 0 , a detailed outbreak and contact investigation is required.\n\nFor early detection of new and emerging respiratory viruses, it is important to establish a programme and systems to detect the fi rst evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of an emerging respiratory pathogen. 37 The occurrence of clusters of SARI in a localised area, the occurrence of an increased mortality or a change in the aff ected age group, or high sales of specifi c therapies for upper respiratory tract infections can be evidence of new and emerging respiratory viruses. WHO, through a number of sentinel labs, monitors and coordinates the surveillance activities for any infl uenza outbreaks as indicated earlier.\n\nSyndromic surveillance combines cases into syndromes rather than specifi c diagnoses. 38 Such surveillance depends on the defi nitions of ILI and SARI that require clinical diagnoses but might not diff erentiate between diff erent etiological causes. Syndromic surveillance uses data from emergency room visits, 39 discharge diagnosis, 40 ambulance dispatch data that successfully identifi ed the expected annual epidemics of infl uenza, 41 family doctor surveillance networks, 42 or general population selfreporting networks. 43, 44 The use of emergency-servicesbased surveillance is most sensitive for severe illness and for illnesses aff ecting elderly individuals. 41, 45, 46 A systematic analysis of syndromic surveillance for infl uenza and ILI in emergency departments showed that various data, such as primary complaint, discharge diagnosis, and free text analysis of the entire medical record, were used. 47 Surveillance of paediatric cases with ILI might also facilitate detection of outbreaks 1-4 weeks before the peak of the disease onset. 48 The largest surveillance networks are the USA DiSTRIBuTE network (no longer active) and the European triple \"S\" system (Syndromic Surveillance Systems in Europe), and these two systems collected large-scale emergency-department-based infl uenza and ILI syndromic surveillance data. 49, 50 Surveillance usually provides the fastest way to identify diseases and is an excellent approach to focus appropriate response measures to any outbreak. 51, 52 Syndromic surveillance systems enable a rapid response to outbreak detection. 53 The establishment of the Japanese non-governmental organisation Agency for Cooperation in International Health as a sentinel surveillance system for selected targets of infectious diseases in, Africa, Asia, and South America revealed unreported infectious diseases such as infl uenza. 54 Syndromic surveillance helps to detect the occurrence of signals of ILI that warrant further investigation. In New York, a rise in the number of cases of respiratory syndrome and fever provided the earliest indication of the occurrence of community-wide infl uenza activity in 2001-02 seasons. 51 An advantage of sentinel syndromic surveillance is the early detection of syndromes before laboratory confi rmation. 51 Syndromic surveillance could depend on the presence of specifi c symptoms of the ILI and SARI and could also depend on the chief or primary complaints of patients. The accuracy of chief complaint had a good agreement for the syndromes of respiratory infection in reference to discharge diagnosis. 38, 51 Syndromic surveillance helped detect the 2009 pandemic infl uenza H1N1 outbreak in the USA 55 and was used in emergency departments in Canada to predict circulating respiratory viral disease such as infl uenza and respiratory syncytial virus. 56 One study compared the Geographic Utilization of Artifi cial Intelligence in Real-time for Disease Identifi cation and Alert Notifi cation (GUARDIAN) system with the Complaint Coder (CoCo) of the Real-time Outbreak Detection System (RODS), the Symptom Coder (SyCo) of RODS, and an electronic medical record (EMR) system. 57 The study showed that the GUARDIAN surveillance system was more robust in performance compared with standard EMR-based reports and the RODS systems in detection of ILI. 57 Emergency department discharge diagnoses increased Series surveillance validity for automated and drop-in syndromic surveillance. 58 The advantages and disadvantages of syndromic surveillance of ILI were discussed by the Provincial Infectious Diseases Advisory Committee. 59 The main disadvantages were that not all patients visit an emergency department as their fi rst step towards treatment, free text entry of data reduces automation of data, and start-up costs are substantial.\n\nChief-complaint-based emergency department surveillance systems are being used for surveillance of infl uenza. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, infl uenza activity in emergency departments increased 2 weeks before it did in outpatient sentinel clinics. 60 The use of physician diagnosis in emergency departments proved superior to chief-complaints surveillance in the same setting. 61 However, such surveillance might be infl uenced by the staff 's knowledge of what occurrs in communities. 62 By contrast, another study showed that self-reporting by patients was better than chiefcomplaint surveillance for prediction of the diagnosis. 63 In emergency departments, increased infl uenza activity could be assessed by triage nurses recording complaints by categories, 64 syndromic analysis of patients' chief complaints, 39 and patient-based free text grouped into diagnostic groups. 65, 66 Similarly, syndromic surveillance is being used in the Hajj pilgrimage for detection of any outbreaks. 67 Patients' chief-complaint and triage data proved to be a good indicator of respiratory complaints. 38 Information on initial patients' complaint and triage data were used in a few surveillance programmes. [68] [69] [70] A computerised triage log was eff ective in the identifi cation of infl uenza outbreaks in the fi rst week. 39 Another method of surveillance relies on nurse helpline telephone calls. 71 In a study from England and Wales, surveillance of infl uenza based on deaths, sickness-benefi t claims (SBC), laboratory reports, and observations from general practitioners showed that general practitioners' statistics and respiratory deaths \n\nIn addition to syndromic surveillance, laboratoryconfi rmed infl uenza hospitalisations and laboratory surveillance depend on identifi cation of the specifi c cause of respiratory infection; they also rely on good laboratory support for the identifi cation of the causative agent. This conventional disease surveillance that relies on passive reporting of confi rmed cases might be slow and insensitive for rapid detection of largescale infectious disease outbreaks. 73 The goals of the laboratory surveillance are provision of information on geographic distribution and secular patterns of circulating viruses, monitoring of antigenic changes in the viruses for vaccine strain selection, monitoring of antiviral resistance, and detection of novel infl uenza subtypes of possible pandemic potential.\n\nThere are mixed results from studies looking at sales of over-the-counter drugs as an indicator of infl uenza activity. The earliest assessment of this indicator of infl uenza activity dates back to 1979. 74 An increase in sales of these drugs occurred 4 weeks after the fi rst infl uenza B isolate and 1 week before peak infl uenza activity. 74 Another study assessed the sale of nonprescription drugs for three consecutive winters 1998-99, 1999-2000, and 2000-01 and did not show any correlation with increased infl uenza activity nationally. 75 Similarly, in a study from Japan, over-thecounter drug sales did not collate with real-time detection systems for infl uenza epidemics. 76 In a study from New York, USA, ILI over-the-counter drug sales increased during infl uenza epidemics and during spring and fall allergy seasons, a fi nding that was similar to trends in emergency departments for fever and infl uenza syndrome. 77 In two other studies from France and Slovenia, drug sales correlated with infl uenza activity. 78,79\n\nNew surveillance systems such as Infl uenzanet, Flu Near You, FluTracking, and Go Viral are a new frontier in the collection of population symptom data ( This network obtains information about ILI directly from volunteers from the diff erent countries who enter data in a web-based interphase. 44, [80] [81] [82] Flu Near You is a website-based survey about symptoms of ILI that can be completed by anyone older than 13 years of age. The website is administered by Healthmap of Boston Children's Hospital in partnership with the American Public Health Association and the Skoll Global Threats Fund. In Australia, FluTracking is an online health surveillance system for the detection of infl uenza. In addition to reporting symptoms of infl uenza, specifi c websites also provide participants with kits including the sample collection materials so that participants can provide a nasal swab and saliva sample for infl uenza testing.\n\nOne of the challenges in the case of outbreaks is the high demand for specifi c supplies such as beds, storage areas, haemodynamic monitors, mechanical ventilators, and specialised personnel. 83 An online cumulative-sumbased model named Overcrowd-Severe-Respiratory-Disease-Index was based on the Modifi ed Overcrowd Index. The model simultaneously monitors and informs the demand of required supplies and personnel and generates early warnings of severe respiratory disease epidemic outbreaks through the interpretation of such variables. 83 BioDiaspora is an easy-to-use, customisable, intelligent web application that predicts the eff ect of infectious diseases worldwide by integration of data on outbreaks, human populations, animal and insect populations, environmental and climatic conditions, and commercial air travel. BioDiaspora has an easy-to-access, web-based, global information system solution that can generate and communicate intelligence about global infectious disease threats in real time and that integrates global epidemic intelligence from HealthMap. 84\n\nEpidemic intelligence is a key component of modern surveillance of emerging infectious diseases. Epidemic intelligence is an ad-hoc detection and analysis of unstructured information available on the internet. This information relies on offi cial and informal sources. Epidemic intelligence was developed in the 1990s after the development of the internet, 85 and several systems exist (tables 2 and 3). [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] The Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) mail is an internet-based reporting system designed for rapid distribution of Description Syndromic surveillance 38-42, 45-47, 58, 68-70 The following clinical data was used: chief complaint and presentation, discharge diagnosis, free text analysis of the entire medical record, calls to triage and help lines, ambulance dispatch calls, discharge diagnosis, ambulance dispatch data that successfully identifi ed the expected annual epidemics of infl uenza Laboratory surveillance 73 Slow and insensitive in rapid detection a large-scale infectious disease outbreak\n\nMedication sales [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] Over-the-counter drug sales correlated with infl uenza activity Self-reporting participatory systems [81] [82] [83] Online-based surveillance system relying on voluntary participation\n\nInformal surveillance and epidemic intelligence [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] 94 Detect relevant information from the internet, nationally and internationally Series information on infectious disease outbreaks. ProMED mail was started in August, 1994, to monitor emerging infectious diseases worldwide. ProMED mail provides early warning of outbreaks of emerging and reemerging diseases. ProMED is an event-based, informal surveillance system where information is received from many offi cial and unoffi cial sources such as WHO, health-care workers, ministries of health, lay public, the media, laboratories, and local health offi cials. On Feb 10, 2003, a request for information was posted on ProMED in relation to an epidemic in Guangzhou. 95 This epidemic became known as SARS. On Sept 20, 2012, ProMED-mail reported the identifi cation of a novel coronavirus (nCoV), later known as MERS-CoV, from a fatal case of severe respiratory illness with renal failure. 5, 96, 97 A team of researchers, epidemiologists, and software developers at Boston Children's Hospital founded HealthMap in 2006. This web-based approach provides informal sources for disease outbreak monitoring and real-time surveillance of emerging public health threats. HealthMap is available as a website, and as a mobile app, Outbreaks Near Me, and both deliver realtime intelligence on a broad range of emerging infectious diseases for a diverse audience, including libraries, local health departments, governments, and international travellers.\n\nThe Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) is a Canadian initiative that draws on the capacity of the internet and worldwide news coverage of health events. 93 GPHIN creates an early warning of outbreaks by monitoring internet media, including news wires and websites, to detect and report disease outbreaks. 94 Google Flu Trend is a web-based site that estimates ILI incidence on the basis of infl uenza-related queries made by millions of users around the world online in search for health data related to infl uenza. 98 Use of Google Flu Trend in emergency departments predicted the 2009 H1N1 outbreak in Manitoba, 99 other emergency rooms, 100 and South Korea. 101 Google Flu Trend results strongly correlated with ILI data from the USA, 98, 102, 103 Australia, 104 Canada, 99 and China 105 and Google Flu Trend was the only external information system to provided the most accurate infl uenza predictions with diff erent prediction models. 106 Google Flu Trend results were less reliable during the 2009 infl uenza H1N1 pandemic in many countries including New Zealand, Singapore, and the USA. [107] [108] [109] Such inconsistency might result from a change in internet search behaviour and the change in age-related internet use. 110-112 Google Flu Trend might not provide reliable surveillance for seasonal or pandemic infl uenza, and the result obtained from this surveillance method should be interpreted with caution. 113 Google Flu Trend also performed poorly compared with laboratory-confi rmed infl uenza. 114 The correlation of Google Flu Trend with infl uenza incidence was most profound in European countries where the internet is most frequently used for healthrelated searching. 115\n\nThe exact epidemiology of ILI and SARI is not well known in Africa and the Middle East. In a study from several countries, from Madagascar to Senegal, the epidemiology and virology of infl uenza viruses showed variation in relation to spatiotemporal circulation of the diff erent virus types, subtypes, and strains. 116 In 2008, the sentinel surveillance system in Madagascar showed that of 26 669 fever cases, 11\u00b71% were ILI. 117 The availability of seasonal infl uenza vaccine in Africa was reported to be 45% of 31 countries who responded to the questionnaire sent by the investigators in one study, and that vaccine coverage data were available for four of 14 countries that reported availability of seasonal infl uenza vaccine. 118 The importance of having laboratory infl uenza virus surveillance was highlighted in a study from west Africa where genetic sequencing of 2009 pandemic infl uenza A H1N1 viruses during 2009-13 showed persistence of two viral lineages. 119\n\nThe challenges for the surveillance of any emerging respiratory viruses, especially at the beginning of any outbreak, are the diffi culties in the identifi cation of the causative agent and the large number of samples received. Ideally, routine cultures might provide the answer for any emerging virus identifi cation; such techniques would require additional safety measures. Comprehensive multiplexed PCR reactions might help in the identifi cation of various agents without the use of biosafety level 3 laboratories. 120 The combined use of culture, rapid antigen detection assays, and molecular assays are often eff ective. 121, 122 The use of a combination of these techniques will decrease the number of samples from patients being tested at one time. 123 Further improvement of surveillance systems to cover diverse areas of the world including developed and developing countries is clearly needed. Such an\n\nWe did a literature search of the electronic database PubMed and Google Scholar (1980-2014) with the following search terms: \"surveillance AND infl uenza\", \"infl uenza\", \"infl uenzalike illness\", \"surveillance\" \"internet-based surveillance\" \"syndromic surveillance\", \"respiratory\" \"viruses\" and \"emerging\". We complemented the search with publications from WHO, Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and Google Scholar. We also reviewed studies cited by articles identifi ed in this search. We included only studies in human beings and in the English language.\n\nFor more on HealthMap see http://healthmap.org/en/ objective could be accomplished by capacity building. The experience in Laos is an excellent example. 124 There was a clear coordination and collaboration between multisector interests such as human and animal health, the Govern ment of Laos, and the international partner community through the Lao National Avian and Human Infl uenza Coordinating Offi ce (NAHICO) resulting in the translation of experience into practical steps to deal with emerging viral infections. 124 The collateral impact of the infl uenza investment in advance of overall public health capacity in Laos has been pronounced, and this could also happen to other resource-limited countries. Real-time data should be displayed on the internet to allow immediate access. The immediate availability of data would help healthcare policy makers in the preparation for any epidemics.\n\nZAM and AZ initiated The Lancet Infectious Diseases respiratory tract infections series.
