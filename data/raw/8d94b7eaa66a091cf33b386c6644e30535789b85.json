{"title": "PD Dr. med. Marcus Panning", "body": "The diagnostic evaluation of patients with nosocomial pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) has traditionally focused on bacteriology (1) . In the past, one of the reasons was the lack of sensitive tests and diagnostic methods in virus detection. In the light of increasing scientific evidence and our own clinical experiences we wish to stress the critical role of modern molecular diagnostic testing methods for respiratory viruses, and in particular for influenza, in HAP, to ensure that state of the art detection, prevention, and management of such pathogens are given their proper place in future guidelines.\n\nCurrently, virological diagnostic work-up is not routinely done in HAP and is often conducted only in individual cases or in certain groups of patients. Comprehensive virological data for HAP are therefore lacking. It can be assumed, however, that the prevalence or viral pathogens in HAP is substantially underestimated.\n\nGiannella and colleagues have recently reported that during the winter months, influenza was confirmed in about a third of patients with respiratory symptoms requiring intensive care (2) . In about half of the cases, influenza was not suspected. In 42% of patients, the infection was acquired nosocomially. A recently published intervention study from the Netherlands has confirmed the critical role of hospital staff in the prevalence of influenza in adult inpatients at university medical centers, as well as the preventive effect of vaccinating the healthcare workers against influenza (3). For emerging infections, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus or respiratory syncytial virus, nosocomial transmission is also well documented.\n\nFor the purposes of preventing infections and the rational use of antibiotics it seems important to us to consider virological etiologies of HAP and to systematically initiate appropriate diagnostic evaluation thereof. Furthermore, influenza vaccination rates among healthcare staff need to be improved, in accordance with the recommendations of Germany's Standing Vaccination Committee (STIKO, St\u00e4ndige Impfkommission). In Reply:\n\nWe thank Panning and coauthors for their letter, which provides us with an opportunity for emphasizing the importance of nosocomial respiratory infections caused by viruses. In the abbreviated version of our guideline published in Deutsches \u00c4rzteblatt this was not possible due to space constraints. In the long version (1), however, we focused-in the chapter on the spectrum of pathogens-on the importance especially of influenza, and in the explanation of recommendation E7 (microbiological testing), we advise virological testing in patients in whom a virus is the suspected pathogen.\n\nWe also agree with our correspondents that more evidence on the subject should become available thanks to the now more widely available molecular biological tests. However, fully published studies on viral etiologies of nosocomial pneumonia are still lacking. The study reported by Giannella et al., which our correspondents cite, can at best be regarded as a pilot study: in 31 of 105 intubated patients with suspected lower respiratory tract infection, whose endotracheal aspirates were sent for analysis, influenza was identified during the flu season. But this had been acquired nosocomially in only 13 cases; furthermore, the manuscript does not provide any information on how many of the subjects did have pneumonia (2) . We hope that more published data on the subject will be available by the time the updated guideline is published, at the end of 2014.\n\nWith regard to the particular importance of flu prevention and emerging viral infections, we can only agree with our correspondents; in this respect, the "}
