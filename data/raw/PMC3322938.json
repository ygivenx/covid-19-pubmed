{"title": "Global Surveillance, National Surveillance, and SARS", "body": "The international response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, from\nMarch to July 2003, tested the assumption that a new and emerging\ninfection\u2013one that had not yet demonstrated its full epidemiologic potential\nbut was spreading from person to person and continent to continent\u2013could be\nprevented from becoming endemic. Within 4 months after the first global alert about the\nnew disease, all known chains of transmission had been interrupted in an outbreak that\naffected 27 countries on all continents. Most public health experts and scientists\nbelieve that the question of whether SARS has become endemic can only be answered after\nat least 12 months of postoutbreak surveillance. The SARS experience, however, made one\nlesson clear early in its course: inadequate surveillance and response capacity in a\nsingle country can endanger national populations and the public health security of the\nentire world. As long as national capacities are weak, international mechanisms for\noutbreak alert and response will be needed as a global safety net that protects other\ncountries when one nation\u2019s surveillance and response systems fail.\n\nDuring the last decade of the 20th century, several outbreaks, including cholera in Latin\nAmerica, pneumonic plague in India, and Ebola hemorrhagic fever in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, caused great international concern (\n1\n\u2013\n3\n). These events demonstrated the consequences that delayed national recognition\nand response to outbreaks could have: illness and death of national populations\nincluding health workers, potential spread to other countries, and significant\ndisruptions of travel and trade. These outbreaks also emphasized the need for a global\nsurveillance and response mechanism. The Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network\n(GOARN), set up in 1997 and formalized in 2000, was one major response to this need\n(World Health Organization [WHO], unpub. data and \n4\n). Though the network, which now has 120 partners throughout the world, currently\nidentifies and responds to more than 50 outbreaks in developing countries each year, the\nSARS outbreak was the first time that GOARN identified and responded to an outbreak that\nwas rapidly spreading internationally.\n\nOne of the partners in GOARN is the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network, which was\nestablished in 1947 to guide the annual composition of vaccines and provide an early\nalert to variants that might signal the start of a pandemic of rapidly evolving\ninfluenza viruses. This network was placed on alert in late November, when the Canadian\nGlobal Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), also a partner in GOARN, picked up\nmedia reports of an influenza outbreak in mainland China (\n5\n). Simultaneously, another GOARN partner, the U.S. Global Emerging Infections\nSurveillance and Response System (GEIS), became aware of similar reports about a severe\noutbreak, with influenza B the suspected cause, in Beijing and Guangzhou. As GOARN\ncontinued to receive reports about influenza outbreaks in China, WHO requested\ninformation from Chinese authorities on December 5 and 11. On December 12, WHO received\na detailed report on data collected at Chinese influenza surveillance sites, indicating\nthat investigation of 23 influenza virus isolates had confirmed type B strains in all\nbut one and that the number of cases was consistent with the seasonal pattern in\nprevious years. The information was reassuring and an indication that the influenza\nsurveillance system was working well.\n\nAlthough information is incomplete, retrospective case identification by Chinese and\nGOARN epidemiologists since May 2003 suggests that two respiratory disease outbreaks\noccurred in Guangdong Province in late November 2002: influenza and what now appears to\nhave been a first wave of SARS cases\u2014an atypical pneumonia that was\ncharacterized by small, seemingly unrelated clusters of cases scattered over several\nmunicipalities in Guangdong, with low-level transmission to healthcare workers (\n6\n). This first wave of atypical pneumonia appears to have continued until a second\nwave of disease with amplified transmission to health workers began occurring during the\nfirst 10 days of February (WHO, unpub. data). On February 10, 2003, the WHO office in\nBeijing received an email message describing an infectious disease in Guangdong Province\nsaid to have caused more than 100 deaths. On February 11, the Guangzhou Bureau of Health\nreported to the press more than 100 cases of an infectious atypical pneumonia outbreak\nthat had been spreading in the city for more than 1 month. That same day, the Chinese\nMinistry of Health officially reported to WHO 300 cases and 5 deaths in an outbreak of\nacute respiratory syndrome, and the next day reported that the outbreak dated back to\nNovember 16, 2002, that influenza virus had not yet been isolated, and that the outbreak\nwas coming under control (\n7\n).\n\nWhen the reports of a severe respiratory disease were received by WHO on February 11,\n2003, a new strain of influenza virus was the most feared potential cause, and the WHO\nGlobal Influenza Network was again alerted. Concern grew on February 20, when the\nnetwork received reports from Hong Kong authorities confirming the detection of A(H5N1)\navian influenza virus in two persons, and WHO activated its influenza pandemic\npreparedness plans (\n8\n).\n\nDuring that same week, laboratories of the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network\nbegan analyzing specimens from a patient with severe atypical pneumonia hospitalized in\nHanoi after travel to Hong Kong. Concurrently, GOARN response teams in Vietnam and Hong\nKong began collecting clinical and epidemiologic information about the patient and a\ngrowing number of others with similar symptoms. As more specimens entered the network\nlaboratories, influenza viruses were ruled out as the causative agent. WHO made its\nfirst global alert on March 12, followed by a second, on March 15, when more than 150\nsuspected new cases had been reported from several geographic areas, including Hong\nKong, Singapore, Vietnam and Canada (\n9\n,\n10\n). With the second alert, WHO provided a case definition and name, thus beginning\na coordinated global outbreak response that brought heightened vigilance everywhere and\nintense control efforts. GOARN linked some of the world\u2019s best laboratory\nscientists, clinicians, and epidemiologists electronically, in virtual networks that\nprovided rapid knowledge about the causative agent, mode of transmission, and other\nepidemiologic features (\n11\n). This real-time information made it possible for WHO to provide specific\nguidance to health workers on clinical management and protective measures to prevent\nfurther nosocomial spread. It also made possible recommendations to international\ntravelers to curtail international spread. Recommendations were at first nonspecific,\nurging international travelers to have a high level of suspicion if they had traveled to\nor from areas where the outbreak was occurring. But as more information became\navailable, airports were asked to screen passengers for history of contact with SARS and\nfor persons with current illness that fit the SARS case definition. Finally, when these\nrecommendations did not completely stop international spread, passengers themselves were\nasked to avoid travel to areas where contact tracing was unable to link all cases to\nknown chains of transmission (\n12\n). Within 4 months, transmission of SARS had been interrupted at all sites, and\non July 5, 2003, the SARS outbreak was declared contained (\n13\n).\n\nAs many times occurs with emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, national\nsurveillance mechanisms failed to identify and respond to the emerging outbreak of SARS\nearly enough to prevent its toll of sickness, death, and international spread (\n14\n). In May 2003, ministers of health from the 192 member countries of WHO\nexpressed their deep concern about the impact of SARS and its implications for future\noutbreaks, which were considered inevitable. In two resolutions, they called for\nincreased national capacity development for surveillance and response and endorsed the\nways in which GOARN obtained information about SARS and supported containment efforts\n(\n15\n,\n16\n). The resolutions stressed the need for countries to give more attention, with\nWHO support, to the strengthening of national surveillance and response capacity, and\nencouraged WHO to continue to strengthen GOARN, its safety net for global alert and\nresponse. As SARS so amply demonstrated, protection against the threat of emerging and\nepidemic-prone diseases requires strong defense systems at national as well as\ninternational levels."}
