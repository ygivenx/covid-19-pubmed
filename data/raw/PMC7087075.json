{"title": "First complete genome sequence of parainfluenza virus 5 isolated from lesser panda", "body": "During the years of 2014\u20132016, fourteen representative clinical samples from ornamental animals (including four lesser pandas, one northeast tiger, one south China tiger, four Panthera leo and four ring-tailed lemurs) were collected from Guangzhou zoo in Guangdong province, southern China. Clinical manifestations of the animals included coughing with thin nasal fluid and a slightly elevated temperature. One lesser panda died, and its necropsy identified the presence of lobular pneumonia in the lungs. Nasal swabs and lung samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use.\n\nFourteen samples were tested for the possible presence of three respiratory-related pathogens (including PIV5, canine distemper virus, and coronavirus) by RT-PCR according to previous studies [27, 28]. The results revealed the positive presence of PIV5 nucleotides in the lesser panda samples. The lung samples from the lesser panda were then homogenized in 10% (w/v) sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4), and centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatants were filtered aseptically (0.22 \u03bcm pore size) and the filtrates (500 \u03bcl) were inoculated onto Vero cell monolayers in a 25-cm2 cell culture flask. After viral attachment for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C, unattached viruses were removed by gentle washing with PBS and the cells were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s minimal essential medium (DMEM, Gibco), containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and 1% antibiotic-antimitotic, at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The viral cultures were harvested when the cytopathic effects (CPE) reached 80% coverage and then stored at \u221280 \u00b0C [25]. In order to observe the virus particles, the cell suspensions were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min, and then fixed using 2.5 ~ 3% glutaraldehyde fixation fluid for about 4 h at 4 \u00b0C in a refrigerator. Finally, they were submitted to the electron microscope center, South China Agricultural University for processing.\n\nRNA extraction of positive homogenates was performed using the MiniBEST Universal RNA Extraction Kit (TaKaRa), and viral RNA was reverse transcribed into first-strand cDNA with a random primer (5\u2032-NNNNNN-3\u2032) using the PrimeScript first strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TaKaRa). PCR was then used to amplify the full-length genome sequences using 12 pairs of primers listed in Table S1. Positive PCR products were purified (MiniBEST Agarose Gel DNA Extraction Kit, TaKaRa) and cloned into the pMD19-T vector (TaKaRa). Positive recombinant plasmids were further sequenced using the Sanger sequencing method (BGI Inc., Guangzhou branch). Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis based on different rubulavirus species sequences (Table 1) was performed using DNAStar Lasergene 7.10 (Madison, WI, USA) and MEGA 5 (http://www.megasoftware.net) [34].\n\n\nIn comparison with uninfected cells (Fig. S1a), Vero cells inoculated with PIV5-positive samples showed demonstrable CPE by passage 3 (Fig. S1b). One viral strain (named ZJQ-221) was thus obtained. Further observation by electron microscopy found that the isolated ZJQ-221 strain was spherical and had a diameter of 50-200 nm that is similar to, and characteristic of, paramyxoviruses (Fig. S1c). Moreover, through sequencing, the full-length genome sequence (15,246 nucleotides, nt) of ZJQ-221 was obtained, which included a 3\u2032 leader sequence (55 nt), seven non-overlapping encoding sequences (i.e., NP gene at positions 152-1681, V/P gene at positions 1850-2518, M gene at positions 3141-4274, F gene at positions 4530-6185, SH gene at positions 6303-6437, HN gene at positions 6584-8281 and L gene at positions 8414-15181, respectively) and a 5\u2032 trailer sequence (31 nt). Complete genome sequence alignments showed that ZJQ-221 had the highest nucleotide similarity (~ 99.8%) with a PIV5 strain of canine-origin (1168-1, GenBank accession no. KC237064) from South Korea and the lowest nucleotide similarity (~ 97.2%) with a PIV5 strain of canine-origin (D277, GenBank accession no. KC237065), respectively (Table S2). Between 1168-1 and ZJQ-221, there were 3-nt, 4-nt, 2-nt, 4-nt, 5-nt, 10-nt and 1-nt differences in the 3\u2032 leader, NP, M, F, HN, L and 5\u2032 trailer, respectively. At the amino acid level, they differed at the following positions: NP (Glu \u2192 Gly at position 108), M (Glu \u2192 Ala at position 375), F (Val \u2192 Ala, Thr \u2192 Ala, Gln \u2192 Arg and Asp \u2192 Ala at positions 134, 279, 339 and 445, respectively), HN (Leu \u2192 Ser, Phe \u2192 Leu, and Asn \u2192 Thr at positions 15, 210 and 288, respectively), and L (Arg \u2192 Lys and Arg \u2192 Leu at positions 1631 and 2248). In addition, the SH protein was not present in some PIV5 strains due to nucleotide substitution, such as KUN-11 (KC852177), SER (JQ743328), CC14 (KP893891) PV5-BC14 (KM067467) and AGS (KX060176), implying that the protein is not essential for PIV5 infection in pigs, dogs, calves and cells [25, 29, 30, 32, 33]. However, the ZJQ-221 strain had a SH protein and was thus different from the above-mentioned PIV5 strains. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1) was performed based on the complete genome sequences of different species of rubulaviruses. In the phylogenetic tree, ZJQ-221 and 1168-1 shared the closest genetic relationship and were clustered in the same branch (Fig. 1).\n\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, very little data about PIV5 infections in zoo animals is available. In this study, we tested whether PIV5 infections are present in lesser pandas, northeast tigers, south China tigers, Panthera leo and ring-tailed lemurs. While the RT-PCR results showed that only lesser panda samples were positive for PIV5, due to the limited number of animal samples collected in the zoo, we believe that PIV5 might not be restricted to lesser pandas. In fact, a previous study showed antibodies against PIV5 exist in zoo tigers [35]. Moreover, PIV5 nucleotide sequences were also detected in nasal swab samples from northeast tiger and south China tiger collected in 2016 in the same zoo, and their F genes were close to the lesser panda-origin PIV5 strain described here (data not shown). This suggests that PIV5 is a common pathogen in zoo animals, and might play an important causal role in the respiratory diseases of zoo animals.\n\nIn summary, we have identified a novel PIV5 isolate in lesser panda and performed whole genome sequencing, indicating that this mammal may act as a possible natural reservoir for this virus. This study contributes to the epidemiology and genomics of PIV5, and suggests an urgent need to strengthen viral surveillance and control of PIV5 in zoo animals.\n\n\nNucleotide sequence accession number: The complete genome sequence of the ZJQ-221 isolate has been deposited in GenBank under the accession number KX100034."}
