{"title": "Recognition of Lys48-Linked Di-ubiquitin and Deubiquitinating Activities of the SARS Coronavirus Papain-like Protease", "body": "Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) recognize and cleave linkage-specific polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains, but mechanisms underlying specificity remain elusive in many cases. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus papain-like protease (PLpro) is a DUB that cleaves ISG15, a twodomain Ub-like protein, and Lys48-linked polyUb chains, releasing diUb Lys48 products. To elucidate this specificity, we report the 2.85 \u00c5 crystal structure of SARS PLpro bound to a diUb Lys48 activitybased probe. SARS PLpro binds diUb Lys48 in an extended conformation via two contact sites, S1 and S2, which are proximal and distal to the active site, respectively. We show that specificity for polyUb Lys48 chains is predicated on contacts in the S2 site and enhanced by an S1-S1 0 preference for a Lys48 linkage across the active site. In contrast, ISG15 specificity is dominated by contacts in the S1 site. Determinants revealed for polyUb Lys48 specificity should prove useful in understanding PLpro deubiquitinating activities in coronavirus infections.\n\nViruses can dampen the host anti-viral response by hijacking the ubiquitin (Ub) system (Bhoj and Chen, 2009; Isaacson and Ploegh, 2009 ) by expressing factors such as viral deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that antagonize Ub-dependent pro-inflammatory pathways (Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014b; Capodagli et al., 2011; Mielech et al., 2014) . For instance, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) human coronaviruses encode viral polypeptide processing proteases that can also catalyze deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities. The relevant host substrates of these viral DUBs and their mechanisms of target selection remain poorly defined.\n\nUb-dependent signaling pathways are regulated by the type of Ub modification (mono-ubiquitin [monoUb] or polyubiquitin [polyUb] ) or type of Ub chain linkage utilized (Pickart, 2001) , as polyUb chains can be formed by conjugation to any of Ub's seven lysine (Lys) residues or its N-terminal methionine (Komander and Rape, 2012) . DUB-mediated cleavage of Ub chains or conjugates serves as a critical regulator or antagonist of Ub-driven signaling pathways .\n\nWhile the molecular basis for monoUb specificity for many human and viral DUBs was revealed in structures of monoUbbound DUB complexes, the molecular basis of Ub chain linkage specificity is understood only for a handful of DUBs (Keusekotten et al., 2013; Mevissen et al., 2013; Sato et al., 2015) . In these cases, specificity is dictated by direct readout of a particular isopeptide-linkage via binding the primed (S1 0 ) Ub and unprimed, or proximal, (S1) Ub across the DUB active site. In one case, Lys11specificity of the OTUD2 catalytic core is achieved by recognizing S1 0 Ub and S1 Ub across the DUB active site, an activity that is aided by another domain that contacts a third Ub in a distal S2 site (Mevissen et al., 2013) . Lys48-linked Ub chains are highly abundant in cells (Kirkpatrick et al., 2006) , and their conjugation to other proteins targets them for proteasomal degradation (Chau et al., 1989) , but the molecular basis for DUB recognition of Lys48-linked Ub chains remains unclear.\n\nUb-based chemical probes have been widely used to profile DUB activities and to stabilize monoUb-bound DUB complexes for structure determination Hemelaar et al., 2004) . Total chemical synthesis of di-ubiquitin (diUb) activitybased probes (Ub-ABPs), with Cys-reactive warheads at the isopeptide linkage of choice (Mulder et al., 2014) enabled profiling of DUB linkage-specificities across S1-S1 0 ; however these ABPs are not suitable for characterizing DUBs that recognize Ub chain topology through alternative mechanisms.\n\nWe and others recently showed that a coronavirus DUB, SARS papain-like protease (PLpro), but not MERS PLpro, preferentially recognizes and releases diUb Lys48 units during cleavage of polyUb chains by an alternative mechanism that relies on SARS PLpro recognition of diUb via at least two binding sites in S2-S1, rather than S1-S1 0 (B\u00e9 k\u00e9 s et al., 2015; Ratia et al., 2014) . The structure of SARS PLpro bound to monoUb revealed surfaces required for S1 recognition and plausible explanations for Ub chain specificity and potential surfaces important for S2 recognition (Ratia et al., 2014) , but the molecular basis for SARS PLpro Lys48-Ub chain specificity remains unknown. We report the crystal structure of SARS PLpro bound to a diUb Lys48 -ABP. The structure reveals SARS PLpro DUB recognition of an extended Lys48-linked diUb chain via distinct S1 Ub and S2 Ub binding sites, and biochemical studies show that S2 Ub binding is most important for polyUb processing. The molecular basis for diUb Lys48 recognition by a Lys48-specific DUB has remained unclear, and in this case, SARS PLpro Ub chain specificity is dominated by indirect readout of a unique diUb chain conformation at a site distal from the active site.\n\nA DiUb Lys48 Activity-Based Probe Preferentially Labels SARS PLpro SARS PLpro and MERS PLpro are efficient deubiquitinating enzymes, on par with other human DUBs (B\u00e1 ez-Santos et al., 2014; B\u00e9 k\u00e9 s et al., 2015; Ratia et al., 2014) ; however, SARS PLpro rapidly removes Lys48-linked Ub chains from conjugated substrates, including polyubiquitinated IkBa stabilized by tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a)/MG132 treatment ( Figure 1A ), and is unique in its recognition and release of diUb Lys48 units from chains of three or more Ubs (B\u00e9 k\u00e9 s et al., 2015) . This unique activity is striking when compared to the related MERS PLpro, since they are structurally similar and share 52% amino acid sequence homology (B\u00e1 ez-Santos et al., 2014) . While SARS PLpro efficiently cleaves higher-molecular-weight (HMW) polyUb Lys48 conjugates, it exhibits poor activity in cleavage assays using free diUb chains or mono-or di-ubiquitinated substrates, such as IkBa ( Figure 1A) . These data supported a model whereby SARS PLpro uses distal Ub binding site (S2) to recognize diUb Lys48 across S2-S1 ( Figure 1B ), rather than across S1-S1 0 , as is typical for most DUBs.\n\nTo provide evidence for this model, a singly N-terminal biotintagged triUb Lys48 chain ( Figure 1C ) was generated (Figures S1A-S1G) and cleaved using SARS PLpro. Analysis of cleavage intermediates shows that the N-terminal biotin-label is retained on the diUb product ( Figure 1D , right), suggesting that tri-ubiquitin (triUb) recognition requires binding via S2-S1, in a distal-to-proximal direction ( Figure 1C , top schematics). In contrast, cleavage intermediates produced by other USP-family DUBs contain mixtures of mono-and diUb products bearing the biotin tag (Figure S2A) . USP21 CD and USP2 CD show little preference, while MERS PLpro displays a slight preference. We next took advantage of linkage-specific diUb activitybased probes that place warheads at the isopeptide linkage (Figure 1E, ''in-between''; Mulder et al., 2014) or proximal end (Figure 1E, ''distal diUb Lys48 ,'' green, right cartoon; Flierman et al., 2016) . The distal diUb-ABP bears an isosteric non-hydrolyzable triazole linker in lieu of the native isopeptide linkage ( Figure S2B ). In labeling assays with SARS PLpro (Figure 1E ), the distal diUb Lys48 -ABP (green) reacted well, monoUb-ABP (orange) reacted slowly, and the in-between diUb Lys48 -ABP (red) reacted poorly, and quantification shows distal diUb Lys48 -ABP adduct forms most efficiently in comparison to other probes (Figures 1F and S2C) . The observation that SARS PLpro formed adducts least efficiently with the in-between diUb Lys48 -ABP probe (compare to monoUb-ABP), suggests that it might bind the inbetween diUb Lys48 -ABP via S2-S1, preventing it from binding and reacting via S1-S1 0 interactions ( Figure S2D ). Importantly, the in-between diUb Lys48 -ABP efficiently labels other DUBs that do not exhibit diUb preferences ( Figures S2E and S2F ). With the ideal reagent in hand, we set out to determine the structural basis for diUb Lys48 recognition by SARS PLpro.\n\nCrystal Structure of SARS PLpro Bound to a DiUb Lys48 -ABP SARS PLpro was cross-linked to the distal diUb Lys48 -ABP, purified and crystallized. Crystals diffracted to 2.85 \u00c5 , and a structure of SARS PLpro-diUb Lys48 -ABP ( Figure 2A ) was determined by molecular replacement (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Two SARS PLpro-diUb Lys48 -ABP complexes occupy the asymmetric unit. The model was refined to an R work /R free of 23.2/26.4 with good stereochemistry (Table 1) . One of the two complexes exhibits continuous electron density, while the other is less ordered with some discontinuity. Electron density is evident for the propargyl warhead of diUb Lys48 -ABP and active site Cys112 of SARS PLpro in both complexes ( Figure S3A ), but the diUb Lys48 isopeptide-mimic triazole linkage is weaker in one complex ( Figure S3B ).\n\nThe diUb Lys48 -ABP-bound SARS PLpro structure reveals the basis for SARS PLpro catalytic domain recognition of proximal ( S1 Ub) and distal ( S2 Ub) Ub molecules within the context of a di-Ub Lys48 unit. The SARS PLpro catalytic domain includes an N-terminal Ub-like (Ubl) domain that is dispensable for SARS PLpro activity (B\u00e9 k\u00e9 s et al., 2015; Mielech et al., 2014) , followed by classical palm and finger DUB domains, as described for SARS PLpro (Ratia et al., 2006) and other USP-family member DUBs . The DUB catalytic module superposes well between diUb Lys48 -ABP-bound SARS PLpro and structures of apo (PDB: 2FE8) or monoUb-bound SARS PLpro (PDB: 4MM3; Figures S3C and S3D), with root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) values of 0.56 \u00c5 and 0.44 \u00c5 over 255 amino acids (Ser61-Ile315), respectively.\n\nThe orientation of diUb Lys48 bound to SARS PLpro is different from prior structures of Lys48-linked Ub chains, whether bound or unbound; this is most apparent when our structure is compared to the ''closed'' conformation of diUb Lys48 (PDB: 1AAR; Cook et al., 1992;  Figure 2B ). It appears that SARS PLpro stabilizes Lys48-linked Ub chains in an extended conformation, akin to conformations of Lys63-or Met1-linked diUb (Komander et al., 2009 ), yet distinct from those as well. Although SARS PLpro contacts S2 Ub and S1 Ub, it makes few contacts to the interface between S2 Ub and S1 Ub or the isopeptide analog ( Figure 2C ).\n\nThe position of S1 Ub within SARS PLpro-diUb Lys48 -ABP is similar to the monoUb-SARS PLpro structure (Ratia et al., 2014) , including contacts to the S1 Ub C terminus; the S1 Ub-Ile44 patch via Met209 of SARS, and polar contacts to S1 Ub-Gln49 and S1 Ub-Arg42 by the SARS PLpro palm domain via Arg167 and Asp168, respectively ( Figure 2D ). The related viral DUB, MERS PLpro, recognizes S1 Ub in a similar manner, yet specific contacts to the S1 Ub-Ile44 patch are not identical (Bailey-Elkin et al., 2014a) . Additionally, SARS PLpro cradles S1 Ub with its fingers domain, with S1 Ub interaction surfaces comprising the largest buried interaction surface area ($890 \u00c5 2 ). In comparison to apo SARS, both structures with monoUb and diUb bound reveal similar displacements of the BL2-loop ( Figure S3E ) that accommodates the Ub C-terminal tail in the active site (Ratia et al., 2014) . When compared to the monoUb-bound SARS PLpro complex, a small conformational change is observed in S1 Ub with respect to displacement of a loop between Ub amino acids 51-57 that is next to Lys48 and the triazole linkage ( Figures S3F and S3G ). To query if displacement could be due to the triazole linkage, our diUb structure was compared to Lys48-linked diUb (PDB 1AAR) revealing that amino acids 51-57 adopt a similar conformation to that observed proximal Ub distal Ub S1 S2 S1' S1 S1 BIOTIN + + S2-S1 / S1' recognition / cleavage S2 /S1-S1' BIOTIN BIOTIN cleavage direction S1 S2 + S2 /S1-S1' BIOTIN S1' Ub-Lys48 and S2 Ub-Gly75 indicating minimal contacts to SARS PLpro. (D) View of contacts between the SARS PLpro palm domain (M209 and Arg167/Asp168) and the S1 Ub, highlighting both hydrophobic and polar interactions ( S1 Ub-Ile44 and -Gln49/Arg42), respectively. (E) View of contacts between the SARS PLpro S2 Ub binding motif (Phe70, Glu71, and His74) and the S2 Ub-Ile44 hydrophobic patch ( S2 Ub-Ile44, -Leu8, and -His68). See also Figure S3 .\n\nin Lys48-linked diUb ( Figure S3F ), despite dissimilar S2 Ub conformations ( Figures 2B and S3G ).\n\nRecognition of S2 Ub involves contacts centered on a hydrophobic interface between the S2 Ub-Ile44 patch and a SARS PLpro a helix between the palm domain and N-terminal Ub-like (Ubl) domain that spans amino acids 62-74 ( Figure 2E ). The buried surface area in the S2 Ub-SARS interface is smaller than the S1 Ub-SARS interface ($540 \u00c5 2 and $890 \u00c5 2 , respectively) but includes contacts to S2 Ub-Ile44, -His68, and -Leu8 by SARS PLpro residues Phe70, Glu71, and His74. S2 Ub-Lys48 is exposed on the surface ( Figure 2E ), suggesting that additional Lys48-linked Ub molecules could be accommodated in the context of a polyUb chain. Other contacts to the S2 Ub core include SARS PLpro residues Asn129, Asn178, and Glu180 from the palm domain, with the latter contacting S2 Ub-Lys11 ( Figure 2E ).\n\nDifferential Contributions of S2 Ub and S1 Ub Binding Sites for PolyUb Lys48 Cleavage We next queried if proximal and distal Ub recognition are important for Ub chain processing by generating SARS PLpro mutants ( Figure S4A ) and assaying their activity on polyUb chains. Nonconservative substitutions of a cluster of residues in SARS PLpro that are in proximity to the S2 Ub-Ile44 hydrophobic patch (e.g., SARS PLpro F70S/E71K/H74G) or individual substitutions F70S and H74G greatly reduce Ub chain cleaving activity by SARS PLpro, as assayed on pentaUb Lys48 ( Figure 3A , top, green; Figure S4B ) and tetraUb Lys48 ( Figure S4C ). In contrast, SARS PLpro N178A/E180K and E180K substitutions, residues that contact S2 Ub-Lys11, have a less pronounced effect on pentaUb Lys48 ( Figure 3A , top, green; Figure S4B ) or tetraUb Lys48 ( Figure S4C ). These data suggest the importance of distal S2 Ub contacts, as the S1 Ub binding surface remains intact in these mutants. Further supporting a dominant role for S2 Ub interactions is the observation that mutation of residues surrounding the S1 Ub-Ile44 patch have a modest effect compared to S2 Ub-Ile44-disrupting mutations for pentaUb Lys48 ( Figure 3A , bottom, blue; Figure S4B ) and tetraUb Lys48 ( Figure S4C ) especially the M209S, R167S, R167S/E168R mutants. The E168R mutant, and a helix-swap mutant that replaces SARS residues with those in MERS PLpro (R167S/E168R+helix), have somewhat diminished activities. And while the N178A/E180K ( S2 Ub-contacting via Lys11) and R167S/E168R+helix mutants ( S1 Ub-contacting via Gln49/Arg42) display diminished polyUb cleaving ability, their defects are less than that observed for the F70S/E71K/ H74G ( S2 Ub-contacting via Ile44) mutant. The catalytic mutant (C112A) has no activity.\n\nThe relative contribution of S1 Ub and S2 Ub interactions within SARS PLpro was further probed by monitoring cleavage activity using tetraUb Lys48 where cleavage depends on binding via S2-S1 ( Figure 3B , top) and comparing this to diUb Lys48 cleavage reactions that depend on binding via S1-S1 0 ( Figure 3B , bottom). It is worth noting that diUb Lys48 cleavage by SARS PLpro requires 5-fold higher concentration of enzyme compared to tetraUb Lys48 to observe activity. SARS PLpro wild-type (WT) activities were also compared to enzymes carrying mutations in the S1 Ub and S2 Ub binding sites using Lys48-linked diUb Lys48 and tetraUb Lys48 substrates ( Figures 3C and 3D ). As expected, the SARS PLpro S2 Ub mutant (F70S/E71K/H74G) exhibits diminished activity against tetraUb Lys48 ( Figure 3C , top) yet retains WT-level activity on diUb Lys48 ( Figure 3C , bottom). Thus, S2 Ub recognition is dispensable for diUb Lys48 cleavage, consistent with an S1-S1 0 binding mode being relevant for diUb Lys48 cleavage. In contrast, the S1 Ub mutant (R167S/E168R+helix) has diminished diUb Lys48 cleavage activity yet retains the ability to cleave tetraUb Lys48 chains with characteristic accumulation of diUb intermediates ( Figure 3C ). Single point mutants of the composite mutants (F70S for S2 Ub, E168R for S1 Ub) exhibit similar cleavage profiles ( Figure S4C ). These results suggest that mutations predicted to disrupt S1 Ub recognition do not prevent cleavage of tetraUb Lys48 when an intact S2 Ub binding surface is present. As earlier, mutations within SARS PLpro predicted to disrupt contacts to S2 Ub near Lys11 have a modest effect on tetraUb Lys48 cleavage, and combining mutations designed to disrupt both S2 Ub-Ile44 and -Lys11 patches are not additive (data not shown). Additionally, mutations designed to disrupt contacts to S2 Ub, alone or in combination, do not display gain-of-function activity toward diUb Lys48 , suggesting that disrupting S2 Ub interaction does not convert SARS PLpro into a DUB with stronger preference for S1-S1 0 binding.\n\nTo quantify the contribution of S2 Ub and S1 Ub contacts with respect to diUb Lys48 recognition by SARS PLpro, we turned to recently developed fluorogenic model diUb Lys48 in S1-S1' S1 S2 S1 S1'\n\nR167S E168R S2 Ub S1 Ub SARS PLpro D E Figure 3 .

Extracted kinetic parameters (k cat and K M ) are in Table 2 . See also Figure S4 .\n\nsubstrates (containing a triazole-linker between Ub moieties), where the AMC fluorophore is conjugated to the proximal end of diUb Lys48 (Flierman et al., 2016) , enabling kinetic characterization of SARS PLpro by monitoring fluorescence during hydrolysis of the -AMC amide bond. Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis of monoUb-and diUb Lys48 -AMC cleavage by SARS PLpro and its selected S2 Ub and S1 Ub mutants reveals that SARS PLpro cleaves the diUb Lys48 -AMC about $37-fold more efficiently than it cleaves monoUb-AMC ( Figure 3E , black and red, respectively; Table 2 , compare apparent k cat /K M values of 3.3E+04 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 for monoUb-AMC to 1.26E+06 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 for diUb Lys48 -AMC). Moreover, kinetic comparison of SARS PLpro mutants reveals that loss of S2 interactions (F70S/E71K/H74G; Figure 3E , green; Table 2 ) results in an $33-fold loss of catalytic efficiency (k cat and K M could not be measured independently, and the S2 mutant could not be saturated by the diUb Lys48 -AMC substrate, indicative of a binding defect). Thus, the S2 mutant converts SARS PLpro into an S1-dependent, monoUb-based DUB. In contrast, mutation of either the hydrophobic interaction in the S1 Ub site (M209S, Figure 3E , light blue; Table 2 ) or polar contacts to S1 Ub (R167S/E168R, Figure 3E , dark blue; Table 2 ) results in a modest decrease in catalytic efficiency, an effect mainly driven by a 2-to 3-fold increase in K M without a corresponding loss in k cat (Table 2) . Assaying additional point mutants at a single monoUb-or diUb Lys48-AMC substrate concentration mirrors these trends ( Figure S4D , top). Importantly, S2 mutants do not exhibit diminished monoUb-AMC cleavage rates ( Figure S4D , bottom), consistent with gel-based experiments, as they maintained activity when processing diUb Lys48 into monoUb. Structure-based alignment of the Lys48 linkage visible in the triazole-linked diUb Lys48 -ABP$SARS-PLpro crystal structure to native Lys48 in free diUb Lys48 (PDB: 1AAR) suggests that the triazole-linkage mimics the distance and geometry of a native isopeptide-bond ( Figure S4E ). To test if the triazole linkage is a good functional mimic of the native isopeptide-bond, we generated a native isopeptide-linked diUb Lys48 -AMC reagent (Figure S4F ) and assayed initial cleavage rates for triazole-linked and native diUb Lys48 -AMC substrates ( Figure S4G) . Results indicate that the triazole linker is a faithful mimic of the isopeptide bond as initial cleavage rates are similar (despite native diUb Lys48 -AMC being contaminated with monoUb-AMC precursor; see Figure S4F ). SARS PLpro could not be saturated using the native substrate due to insufficient quantities, so inhibition studies were performed with triazole-linked or native isopeptide diUb Lys48 -AMC as substrates to calculate inhibition constants (K i ) using Lys48linked Ub chains as inhibitors. Results in Figure S6A .\n\ninhibit triazole-linked or native diUb Lys48 -AMC cleavage with comparable K i values (9 and 10 mM or 12 and 10 mM, respectively), values just $3-fold lower than the K M for diUb Lys48 -AMC as determined by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Additionally, diUb Lys48 inhibited monoUb-AMC hydrolysis with a K i of $2.2 mM, a result consistent with kinetic assays where diUb Lys48 recognition is preferred over monoUb. We were unable to observe inhibition of cleavage of diUb Lys48 -AMC substrates using monoUb or free ISG15 (Table 2) . Collectively, these results support the conclusion that distal S2 Ub and proximal S1 Ub binding surfaces are important for SARS PLpro activity, with S2 Ub interactions being dominant, and that polyUb contacts to S2-S1 surfaces are preferred over interactions with S1-S1 0 when processing Lys48-linked Ub chains.\n\nDiUB can be linked via seven Ub lysine residues as well as its N terminus to alter their topology. Although dynamic, diUb conformations can be stabilized by interactions between Ub molecules, sometimes templated by their interacting partners (Ye et al., 2012) . Linkage specificity for most DUBs characterized thus far is determined by contacts across the protease active site with diUb occupying S1-S1' sites (Keusekotten et al., 2013; Mevissen et al., 2013; Sato et al., 2008 Sato et al., , 2015 . As shown previously, SARS PLpro is poor at cleaving diUb and does not strictly require a specific linkage across S1-S1 0 (B\u00e9 k\u00e9 s et al., 2015). Given the extended conformation of diUb Lys48 observed in complex with SARS PLpro and the paucity of contacts to the diUb Lys48 linkage ( Figure 2C ), we hypothesized that SARS PLpro might indirectly sense linkage specificity by requiring that diUb occupies both S2 Ub and S1 Ub sites, a requirement that would place limits on the type of chain that could be accommodated because of differences in chain topology and distance between individual Ub molecules relative to the two Ub binding sites.\n\nTo assess S2-S1 linkage specificity of SARS PLpro, we tested a panel of linkage-specific distal diUb-ABPs to covalently label SARS PLpro. Although not as efficient as diUb Lys48 -ABP, diUb Lys27 -ABP exhibited better labeling efficiency compared other linkage-specific diUb-ABPs, which reacted at levels similar to monoUb-ABP ( Figure 4A and S5A). Since covalent activitybased probes are very reactive, we also tested linkage-specific diUb-AMC substrates by analyzing initial cleavage rates by SARS PLpro. These results suggest that SARS PLpro activity is highly restricted to diUb Lys48 -AMC cleavage ( Figures 4B and  S5B ) as diUb Lys48 -AMC is cleaved $100-fold faster compared to other linkages. Each chain-forming residue in S1 Ub is available for conjugation in our diUb Lys48 -SARS PLpro complex (Figure 4C ), but the distance between S1 Ub-Lys48 and the SARS-Phe70 S2 Ub binding site is closest (26 \u00c5 ) with each of the other sites requiring an additional 10 to 15 \u00c5 to span between the conjugated lysine and S2 Ub binding site ( Figure S5C ). This raised the possibility that linkage-specificity across S2-S1 is enforced by restricting access to other topologies by requiring that SARS PLpro read the distance between diUb Ile44 hydrophobic patches via S2-S1 ( Figure 2B ), a requirement that is only satisfied by chains carrying Lys48 linkages. Accordingly, assaying homotypic linkage-specific tetra-ubiquitin (tetraUb) chains in endpoint cleavage assays also confirmed SARS PLpro to be Lys48-specific ( Figure 4D ).\n\nSARS PLpro Lys48 Specificity Is Also Aided by S1-S1 0 Interactions Most linkage-specific DUBs characterized to date rely on S1-S1 0 interactions to achieve linkage-specificity, although OTUD2 and OTUD3 have been shown to utilize both S2-S1 and S1-S1 0 interactions to mediate Lys11-and Lys6/11-specificity, respectively (Mevissen et al., 2013) . We noticed greater defects for diUb Lys48 -AMC cleavage for some SARS PLpro mutants (especially E180K, N178A/E180K, E168R, and R67S/E168R+helix) compared to gel-based assays using polyUb Lys48 substrates. As diUb Lys48 -AMC requires only S2-S1 interactions for cleavage, we wondered if additional interactions outside S2-S1 might be responsible for the residual specificity and activity observed for cleavage of polyUb Lys48 substrates.\n\nTo determine if a Lys48-linkage was also preferred across S1-S1 0 ( Figure 4E ), we assayed SARS PLpro and its S2 Ub-Ile44 mutant (F70S/E71K/H74G) for cleavage of homotypic Lys48and Lys63-linked tetraUb chains and a mixed linkage tetraUb chain consisting of two Lys48-linked dimers linked by Lys63 (see schematics in Figure 4F ). This latter mixed chain could be recognized by SARS PLpro in S2-S1, but its cleavage would require accommodation of a Lys63-linkage across S1-S1 0 . A time course reveals that SARS PLpro readily cleaves homotypic Lys48 tetraUb chains but is inactive on homotypic Lys63 tetraUb chains. Interestingly, the mixed chain is cleaved when the Lys63 linkage is presented across S1-S1 0 , but only when an intact S2 site is present ( Figure 4G ). Initial cleavage rates ( Figure 4H) show that SARS PLpro is $5-fold slower in cleaving the mixed chain compared to the homotypic Lys48-linked chain, suggesting some specificity for a Lys48 linkage across S1-S1 0 . More importantly, the S2 Ub-Ile44 mutant exhibits faster cleavage rates on homotypic Lys48 chains than on mixed or on homotypic Lys63linked chains (Figures 4G and 4H ). Taken together, these data suggest a measurable specificity for Lys48 across S1-S1 0 , even when diUb Lys48 recognition via S2-S1 is compromised. Thus, Lys48-specificity of SARS PLpro is enforced by S2-S1 recognition but complemented by a preference for Lys48 linkages across S1-S1 0 , suggesting that SARS PLpro would be most active on polyUb Lys48 chains. Consistent with the hypothesis of S2-S1-S1 0 recognition of polyUb Lys48 chains, di-and monoUb-conjugated IkBa accumulates during cleavage by SARS PLpro (Figure 1D , IkBa), while unmodified IkBa remains static ( Figure 1D , lighter exposure IkBa). These data suggest that SARS PLpro acts efficiently on polyUb Lys48 chains in a diUb-dependent manner yet generates mono-and diUb-conjugated substrate remnants that may no longer represent its preferred substrate.\n\nIn the absence of a crystal structure of a diUb Lys48 unit occupying S1-S1 0 sites of SARS PLpro, we analyzed our structure for loops predicted to be proximal to S1 0 within SARS PLpro that differ in sequence from MERS PLpro, which displays little linkage-specificity across S1-S1 0 (B\u00e9 k\u00e9 s et al., 2015) . We identified two residues, W107 and A108, adjacent to the exit tunnel of the SARS PLpro active site and mutated them to residues observed in MERS PLpro ( Figure S5D ). Cleavage assays with this putative S1 0 mutant reveals that W107L/A108S has diminished activity on triUb Lys48 , which requires interactions with S2-S1-S1 0 ( Figures S5E and S5F ), but exhibits no significant loss of activity when cleaving diUb Lys48 -AMC, a substrate that is solely dependent on S2-S1 ( Figure S5F ).

Combined with the observation that a Lys48-linked isopeptide is preferred as a substrate, these data suggest that S1 0 -dependent recognition of Lys48-linkages by SARS PLpro is possible, although additional work will be required to explore this hypothesis.\n\nRequires Distinct Elements within SARS PLpro ISG15 is a tandem ubiquitin-like (Ubl) molecule consisting of two Ubl folds linked by a flexible hinge (Narasimhan et al., 2005) . ISG15 is implicated in antiviral immunity, and it is a preferred substrate of SARS PLpro when compared to monoUb. Indeed, ISG15-AMC is cleaved $20-fold faster than Ub-AMC (Table 2 ) (B\u00e9 k\u00e9 s et al., 2015; Lindner et al., 2007; Ratia et al., 2014) . DiUb Lys48 -AMC (apparent k cat / K M of 1.26E+06 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 ) is only preferred by $2-fold compared to ISG15-AMC (apparent k cat /K M of 5.98E+05 M \u00c01 s \u00c01 ), suggesting that the preferred substrate for SARS PLpro is Lys48-linked polyUb chains.\n\nThe activity of SARS PLpro on ISG15 has been shown to be dependent on the distal Ubl within ISG15 (Lindner et al., 2007) . Because the S2 binding site is important for diUb Lys48 cleavage as described here and as proposed previously (Ratia et al., 2014) , we sought to directly compare mutations in S2 and S1 of SARS PLpro and their impact on ISG15 cleavage activity. SARS PLpro S1 Ub and S2 Ub mutants were used to cleave ISG15-AMC using Michaelis-Menten kinetics ( Figure 5A ). Mutations have contrasting effects for ISG15-AMC cleavage (Figure 5A ; Table 2 ). The S1 polar mutant ( Figure 5A , dark blue) exhibits greater defects for ISG15-AMC cleavage with minimal effects diUb Lys48 -AMC cleavage. In contrast, the S2 mutant exhibits major defects for diUb Lys48 -AMC cleavage with less severe defects in ISG15-AMC cleavage. To confirm these differential effects, we utilized lysates prepared from IFNb/MG132-treated cells that contained polyUb Lys48 chains and ISG15-conjugated substrates and added recombinant SARS PLpro mutants (Figure 5B ). Analyzing loss of HMW polyUb Lys48 -conjugates and the appearance of free ISG15, indicative of cleavage of ISGylated substrates, reveals contrasting effects for S2 and S1 mutants ( Figure 5C ). While the S2 mutant compromises polyUb Lys48 chain, but not ISG15 cleavage, the S1 mutant has the opposite effect. Finally, we compared other SARS PLpro mutants for cleavage of diUb Lys48 -AMC and ISG15-AMC (Figure S6B) . Overall, S2 Ub site mutants (green) show minimal loss of ISG15-AMC cleavage activity, while S1 Ub mutants (blue), particularly those containing the E168R mutation, have a pronounced loss-of-function effect. Thus, ISG15 recognition appears more dependent on interactions within S1 and perhaps an alternative S2, while diUb Lys48 recognition is more dependent on contacts within S2. It is difficult to rationalize these effects in the absence of a structure of ISG15 bound to SARS PLpro, but it appears clear that ISG15 recognition differs in details when compared to diUb Lys48 recognition ( Figure S6C ).\n\nDISCUSSION SARS PLpro appears unique among viral and human DUBs characterized thus far in its ability to recognize polyUb chains by reading units of a Lys48-linked diUb (B\u00e9 k\u00e9 s et al., 2015) . Here, we reveal the structural basis for diUb Lys48 recognition and specificity by SARS PLpro. Coupled with mutational, biochemical and kinetic data, our structure helps to explain the strict Lys48linkage specificity exhibited by this viral DUB, which is primarily enforced by engaging the diUb module within S2-S1, and enhanced by a slight preference for Lys48-linked Ub across S1-S1 0 ( Figure 5D ). To our knowledge, the diUb Lys48 -SARS PLpro structure represents the only available structure of a linkage-specific DUB bound to a Lys48-linked Ub chain, a result enabled by recently developed diUb activity-based probes (Flierman et al., 2016) .\n\nInstead of relying on diUb recognition across S1-S1 0 , as is common among other DUBs (Keusekotten et al., 2013; Mevissen et al., 2013; Sato et al., 2015) and endoproteases (Berger and Schechter, 1970) , SARS PLpro recognizes diUb across S2-S1 binding surfaces that are tuned to recognize Lys48-linked Ub chains. This mode of Ub chain recognition has only been reported for the catalytic core of OTUD2, where an additional bind-ing site mediates interaction with a Lys11-linked diUb (Mevissen et al., 2013) . Through modeling, mutational analysis, and the crystal structure of a monoUb-bound SARS PLpro, the Mesecar group suggested that SARS PLpro is an S2-S1 mode DUB (Ratia et al., 2014) and that the distal Ub would be recognized by a hydrophobic surface in SARS PLpro, involving Phe70. Our current study illuminates the structural basis for this interaction. We provide biochemical evidence that the S2 Ub interface has a dominant role in diUb Lys48 recognition and polyUb chain cleaving activity, since mutating the distal S2 Ub recognition surface is more detrimental than disrupting the proximal S1 Ub recognition surface. We also provide evidence that SARS PLpro Lys48specificity is complemented by a preference for Lys48-linked chains across S1-S1 0 .\n\nThe hydrophobic patches in Ub proteins are usually packed against each other in free Ub Lys48 chains (Fushman and Wilkinson, 2011) . In the diUb Lys48 -SARS PLpro complex, diUb Lys48 exhibits an extended conformation, with Ub hydrophobic patches separated by $30 \u00c5 and recognized by contacts provided by the S1 Ub and S2 Ub sites in the diUb Lys48 -SARS PLpro complex. As Ub chains are dynamic in solution (Ye et al., 2012) , and because SARS PLpro is structurally similar in apo, monoUb, and diUb Lys48 complexes, it is likely that SARS PLpro captures diUb units in this conformation.\n\nWhile SARS PLpro exhibits an $5-fold preference for a Lys48linkage in the S1-S1 0 binding mode when an S2 site is also occupied, a lax requirement at S1 0 is consistent with its function as an endopeptidase for viral pre-protein processing and perhaps cleavage of ISG15 substrates. The biological targets of SARS PLpro remain unclear, but the preference for polyUb Lys48 chain cleavage into units of diUb Lys48 suggests it is likely targeted to substrates that are modified by Lys48-linked polyUb chains.\n\nThe diUb-based recognition exhibited by SARS PLpro suggests that SARS PLpro could stabilize monoUb-modified substrate products (B\u00e9 k\u00e9 s et al., 2015) , as they are not preferred substrates for SARS PLpro. Indeed, cleavage of Lys48-linked polyUb chains from IkBa by SARS PLpro led to an increase in di-and monoUb-conjugated forms of IkBa. Whether SARS PLpro cleaves other polyUb Lys48 -conjugated substrates to dior monoUb-conjugated forms remains to be determined. Mono-ubiquitination at membranes and at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been shown to regulate endocytosis and vesicle trafficking (Clague et al., 2012) , which are also involved in coronavirus propagation. Given that SARS PLpro is ER localized, it is possible that SARS PLpro functions to stabilize mono-Ub ''stubs'' on ER substrates to provide an unknown advantage for the virus.\n\nIt remains unclear if the anti-inflammatory properties of SARS PLpro require all or a combination of its endopeptidase, DUB, or deISGylating activities. With mutations described herein, which bias activities in deubiquitination versus deISGylation, it may be possible to discern if both activities are important during SARS infection. With that said, it is worth noting that SARS viral titer levels peak at 16-20 hr in cell culture and in mouse model infection studies (Channappanavar et al., 2016; Totura and Baric, 2012) , while interferon (IFN)-responsive genes, such as ISG15, are only induced later during infection (Channappanavar et \n\nS2-S1-S1' mediated S2-S1 mediated S1 mediated ?

(D) Schematic representation of SARS PLpro substrate specificity. Dashed lines can indicate the -AMC substrate, a non-Lys48-linked Ub unit, or a protein substrate. See also Figure S6 . 2016). As such, it is likely that the virus has already achieved its full replicative potential before SARS PLpro would encounter ISG15. Additionally, the function of substrate-conjugated ISG15 in anti-viral immunity in humans is now in question (Bogunovic et al., 2012) , as a non-conjugatable form of ISG15 was shown to have similar activities as WT ISG15, likely via stabilization of USP18 (Zhang et al., 2015) . Given the preference for polyUb Lys48 and diUb Lys48 over ISG15, it appears likely that polyUb Lys48 -conjugated substrates are the primary cellular targets of SARS PLpro. These observations suggest that SARS PLpro activities against ISG15 targets may not be as relevant for coronavirus infection as previously thought.\n\nAlthough the identity of true SARS PLpro substrates remains to be determined, they could include host factors involved in anti-viral signaling, such as IkBa, or viral proteins targeted for degradation by host anti-viral E3 ligases. We propose a model where the most favored substrates for SARS PLpro would be Lys48-linked polyUb chains (S2-S1-S1 0 dependent), followed by diUb Lys48 -conjugates (S2-S1 dependent), followed by ISG15-conjugates, with the least favored substrates being monoUb-conjugated substrates and other polyUb chains (only S1 dependent) ( Figure 5D ).\n\nSynthesis of the Singly Biotinylated TriUb Lys48 Substrate Biotinylated triUb Lys48 was generated using procedures based on previously reported protocols (El Oualid et al., 2010) with modification described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.\n\nCloning, Protein Expression, Purification, Crystallization, and Structure Determination of the SARS-PLpro$DiUb Lys48 -ABP Complex The generation of recombinant SARS PLpro was described elsewhere (B\u00e9 k\u00e9 s et al., 2015) , with modifications as described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. SARS PLpro (45 mM) was reacted with diUb Lys48 -PRG (45 mM) for 30 min at 37 C in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT; purified by size-exclusion chromatography; concentrated to 11 mg/ml; and frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage (\u00c080 C). Diffraction-quality crystals ($50-100 mm) grew for 1 month at 12 C by hanging drop vapor diffusion against 0.1 M MES (2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid) (pH 5.5), 0.1 M lithium-acetate, and 12%-20% PEGs 4000/6000/8000. Single crystals were cryo-protected by addition of 20% ethylene glycol and flash cooled in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected from a single crystal and processed, and the structure was determined using methods reported in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.\n\nFor qualitative assays, DUBs (1 mM) were incubated with excess activitybased probes (2-5 mM, monoUb-PRG, diUb Lys48 -VME [''in-between'' diUb-ABP]; Mulder et al., 2014) or diUb Lys48 -PRG (''distal'' diUb-ABP; Flierman et al., 2016) for indicated times at 37 C in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT. Reactions were performed at least in duplicate. For linkage-specific distal diUb-ABPs, TAMRA-labeled probes were used in a 30-s labeling assay at 37 C. Reactions were quenched with loading sample buffer (43 LDS [Invitrogen], with 5 mM DTT), and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and SYPRO-staining. Gels were scanned to visualize the TAMRA-label (488 nM), imaged using Bio-Rad Gel-Doc, quantified by ImageJ software, and graphed with Prism. Error bars represent \u00b1SEM.\n\nTo determine apparent k cat /K M for SARS PLpro and its mutants, monoUb-AMC, diUb Lys48 -AMC, and ISG15-AMC were prepared as 2-fold serial dilu-tions (starting at 30 mM: monoUb and diUb Lys48 [triazole-linked] ; at 15 mM: ISG15-AMC) in 20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT. SARS PLpro was used at 10 nM (diUb Lys48 -and ISG15-AMC) or 50 nM (monoUb-AMC), and the final reaction volume was 10 ml. Substrates and DUBs were preincubated at 25 C for 1 min, and cleavage of UBL-AMCs was performed at 30 C using a Spectramax fluorescence plate reader running SoftMax Pro 5 (Molecular Devices) operated in kinetic mode in black, round-bottom 384well plates (Corning, #3698). AMC fluorescence was monitored by excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm over time for 5-10 min. Initial linear cleavage rates (V i ) were fitted by the Michaelis-Menten equation by Prism based on a free AMC standard curve. Experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and error bars indicate \u00b1SEM. To compare triazole-linked or native diUb Lys48 -AMC, substrates were prepared as 2-fold serial dilutions of 3.75 mM (limited by the concentration of the native diUb Lys48 -AMC). Assays were performed in duplicate. To compare individual SARS PLpro mutants, monoUb-AMC, diUb Lys48 -AMC, and ISG15-AMC were used at 400 nM final concentrations, using 10 or 50 nM SARS PLpro. Data were plotted as percent of WT cleavage rates for each substrate (n = 3), and error bars indicate \u00b1SEM. To compare linkage-specific diUb-AMC substrates using SARS PLpro, diUb-AMC substrates were used at 200 nM final concentrations, using 5 nM SARS PLpro. Data were plotted as percent of the diUb Lys48 -AMC cleavage rate (n = 3), and error bars indicate \u00b1SEM.\n\nUb chains (1 mM; 20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT) were cleaved at 37 C for indicated times by SARS PLpro WT and its mutants at 10 nM for penta-, tetra-, and triUb Lys48 or 50 nM of diUb Lys48 cleavage. Reactions were quenched with loading sample buffer (43 LDS, Invitrogen) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and SYPRO-staining. Gels imaged using a Bio-Rad Gel-Doc, quantified by ImageJ, cropped where indicated by heavy dashed lines, and graphed using Prism. Assays using SARS mutants were performed in batches; mutants were always compared to cleavage by WT. Loss of uncleaved substrate is expressed as a percent value of uncleaved substrate over the total Ub signal per lane. Initial cleavage rates were calculated from linear portions of curves showing loss of uncleaved substrate over time and expressed as percent of WT rates in arbitrary units. Reactions performed at least in duplicate. Error bars represent \u00b1SEM.\n\nLysates from human interferon beta (IFN-b; 500 U/ml, 48 hr) or TNF-a (10 ng/ml, 10 min) and MG132 (10 mM, 40 min) stimulated HeLa cells (10 mg total lysate per reaction) were incubated with 100 or 50 nM DUBs, as indicated, in 20-ml reaction volumes with 25 mM DTT for indicated times. Reactions terminated by heating in SDS loading buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting with indicated antibodies. Blots developed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) chemiluminescence. Films were scanned, cropped where indicated by heavy dashed lines, quantified and graphed as described above.
