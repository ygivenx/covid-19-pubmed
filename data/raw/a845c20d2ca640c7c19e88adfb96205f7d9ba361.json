{"title": "Viral Antibody Tilers, Immunogenetic Markers, and Their Interrelations in Multiple Sclerosis Patients and Controls", "body": "The cause of multiple sclerosis (MS) is complex and many facts observed repeatedly during the two last decades still remain unexplained. Elevated antibody titers al'e found in serum and cerebro~pinai fluid of patients with MS, against measles, and less frequently against other viruses including herpes simplex, varicella-zoster, rubella, vaccinia, influenza, and Epstein-Barr viruses [1] [2] [3] . These findings can be interpreted in various ways. Elevated antibody titers may be either a consequence of the disease itself, or in relation with the role of various common viruses in the pathogenesis of MS. Another explanation is that increased levels of viral anti-0198-8859/91/$3.50 between HLA-DQwl and antibody liters against various viruses exists in controls but is absent in MS patients. In particular, we found that mumps antibody liters were higher in DQwl-positive than in DQwl-negative controls, while there was no significant difference among MS cases. Accordingly, we found that the overall difference between patients and controls was due to the fact that DQwl-positive patients had higher tilers than controls, while DQwl-negative cases had similar titers as controls. These findings suggest that biological and molecular characteristics of DQwl might differ in MS patients. Human Immunology 31, 94-99 (1991) MS multiple sclerosis bodies in MS patients may be related to immunogenetic factors associated with MS. Thus, because of specific structural co +r, plemer,,.~rit/e~ of aatige.,:s, immun~ response against viral antigens lnighi be controlled by genes linked with the HLA alleles associated with MS. This hypothesis is supported by several reports on the difference in response to vaccines (poliomyelitis, diphtheria typhoid, vaccinia virus) and viral antigens (rubella, measles, influenze, and Epstein-Barr viruses) in relation with HLA phenotypes [4] [5] [6] [7] , especially with HLA-DR antigens. Antibody levels after immunization against various infectious agents depend also on genes coding for immunoglobulin G heavy chains (Gm) [8] , and association between Gm allotypes and susceptibility to MS has been reported [9, 10] . The purpose of our study was to investigate possible interrelations between viral antibody titres, HLA-class II antigens and immunoglobulin Gm allotypes in MS patients and controls.\n\nHuman Immunology 31, 94-99 (1991}\n\nThe present investigation is a part of a population-based case-control study on MS which was conducted in the Hantes-Pyr~ntes \"dtpartement\" (a jurisdiction in the southwest of France). Ascertainment of MS cases is described with details elsewhere [11] . Only patients with definite or probable MS according to the criteria of Poser et al [ 12] were included. A control group consisting of healthy individuals of similar age and sex as the patients and living in the same area was selected for comparisons. The geographical origin of patients and controls was documented by their birthplace and that of their parents.\n\nThe present investigation was restricted to the major histocompatibility complex class II antigens, HLA-DR 1-w14 and HLA-DQ wl-w3. Typing was performed by the two-color fluorescence method using 49 anti HI.A-DR and 9 HLA-DQ alloantisera or monoclonal antibodies, either local or obtained by exchanges following the Eighth and Ninth Histocompatibility Workshops.\n\nSamples were also tested for Gm allotypes of lgGl: G1m (1, 2, 3, 17), IgG2: G2m (23), and IgG3: Gm (5, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 28) . Allotyping was performed by the classical hemagglutination inhibition method on opaline plates at room temperature [13] . The reagents used for determination were of human origin, except for the G2m [23] allotype (rabbit antisera). The allotypes IgG3 (5, 10, 11, 13, 14) are designated by 5*.\n\nRubella, measles, cytomegalovirur, herpes simplex type 1 virus, varicella, and mumps antibodies were determined using ELISA technique (Enzygnost Behring). Titers were defined by comparing optic density between each sample and serial dilutions of a known reference serum. Logdogit regression curves of this reference serum were established on computer.\n\nCoronavirus antigen was prepared in our laboratory from bovine enteric coronavirus (BECV) (stain C3II100) cultivated on HRT 18 (human rectal adenocarcinoma), kindly supplied by J. Laporte (INRA, Grignon, France). HRT 18 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 u/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Two-day-old confluent monolayers were inoculated with BECV diluted in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The inoculum was allowed to adsorb for 1 hr at 37\u00b0(2 with manual rocking every 10 rain, then the medium was removed and fresh medium added.\n\nAfter an incubation period of 3 days at 370C, cell cukures were frozen and thawed; suspension was homogenized and centrifuged at 3400 g for 10 rain. The superuatant was then centrifugated at 18,500 g for 1 hr (Ultra centrifuge, Beckman, Rotor 50Ti). The supematant was removed and the pellet homogenized in buffer pH 9.6 (Na2CO3 0.1 M, NaHCO~ 0.1 M). After centfifugation for 10 rain at 3400 g, the superna~ant was titrated by checkboard technique using human serum with high titer of coronavirus antibodies. The same, previously described, technique of ELISA titration was used for the determination of coronavirus antibodies.\n\nAll alters were compared by transforming to log 2 the reciprocal of dilutions (geometric titer). An arbitrarily small number was assigned to trace and undetectable titers.\n\nAll typlngs and serological measurements were performed blindly.\n\nStatistics. Antigen frequencies were compared by the X 2 test and geometric titers by the two-tailed t-test. Variance analysis was performed for relationships between genetic marker frequencies and viral antibody titers.\n\nPatient population. We studied 57 MS patents: 42 females and 15 males. The mean age at the time of the study was 43.9 yr. There were 35 patients with a retapsing-remitring form of MS and 22 patients with a primary or secondary chronic progressive course of the disease. Controls (n = 59) had similar mean age (45.7 yr) and sex ratio as MS patients. Forty-eight patients (84%) and all controls originated from the southwest of France or from Spain.\n\nFor technical reasons, some data was missing but neither the size of the MS patient group nor that of the control group was ever lower than 53.\n\nAntibody titers in MS patients and controls. Mumps antibody titers were significantly higher in MS cases than in controls; mean geometric titets were 6.31 and 5.66, respectively (p = 0.002). As shown in Table 1 , patients and controls had comparable andbody titers against the six other viruses. Antibody titers against measles were slightly higher in MS patients than in controls but the difference was not statistically significant.\n\nOf the DR-locus antigens, HLA-DR2 was present in 54.3% of MS patients and 23.7% of controls (p = 0.001). The frequency of HLA-DQwl was also higher in patients than in controls (80.7% vs. 54.2%, p = 0.01). No difference was found for any oftbe other HLA-DR and HLA-DQ antigens.\n\nThe detailed results of Gm allotype frequencies in patients and controls have been reported [9] . A significant excess of patients with the phenotype Gm (3; -+23; Relationship of viral antibody titers with HLA-DR2, HLA-DQwl, and Gm (3, -+23; 5*) in MS patients and controls. Relationships between viral antibody titers and the genetic markers associated with MS were analyzed separately in MS patients and in controls.\n\nThe first result of this analysis was that antibody levels in controls correlated with the presence of DQwl (Table 2 ). This correlation was either positive or negative.according to the virus. Thus, antibody titers against measles, rubella, and coronavirus were significantly higher in DQwl-positive than in DQwl-negative controls, while antibody titers against cytomegalovirus were significantly elevated in DQwl-negative controls. No general pattern of association between DQwl and viral antibody titers was observed in MS patients. Interestingly, only mumps antibody titers differed significantly according to whether MS patients were DQwl-positive or DQwl-negative.\n\nThe two other markers, DR2 and Gm (3, -+23; 5\") ( Table 2) , did not appear to be related with viral antibody titers, neither in controls nor in MS patients. We found new significant results which might be interpreted as chance results. Thus, DR2-positive controls had higher levels of antibodies against coronavirus than DR2-negative controls. The phenotype Gm (3, -+23; 5*) was significantly associated with higher titers against cytomegalovirus in controls and lower titers against varicella-zoster in MS patients. But on the whole, viral antibody levels were very similar for all Gm phenotypes.\n\nThe second step of this part of the analysis was to compare antibody titers in MS patients and controls within six subgroups with identical HLA-DR2 (+/-), HLA-DQwl (+/-), or Gm (3, -+23; 5\") (+/-) phenotypes.\n\nOverall, this immunogenetic adjustment did not re- veal any significant differences between MS patients and controls, except for mumps. Points on Fig. 1 represent the differences of mean mumps antibody titers between MS patients and controls, in the six subgroups; points are above the zero line when titers are higher in patients than in controls. Multiple sclerosis patients who were positive for DQwl had significantly higher levels of antibodies against mumps than DQwl-positive controls, while mumps antibody titers were similar in DQwlnegative patients and DQwl-negative controls. Also, DR2-positive MS patients had higher titers than DR2positive controls, but this difference was not statistically significant. In the two subgroups defined according to Gm (3, -+23; 5*) phenotype, antibody titers were higher in MS patients than in controls (Fig. 1) .\n\nBesides the classical association of MS with HLA-DR2 and HLA-DQwl, we found an increased frequency of Gm (3, -+23; 5*) in MS patients who lived in the Hautes-Pyrtn~es by comparison with controls living in the same area. Antibody titers against seven viruses were measured and anti-mumps antibody levels were significantly higher in MS patients than in controls. No significant difference was found for measles; however, MS patients had slightly higher titers than controls.\n\nAssociation between antibody titers and immunogenetic markers was analyzed. The first important observation was that viral antibody titers in control individuals varied significantly depending on the presence or absence of DQwl. The presence of DQwl antigen was associated with elevated antibody titers against measles, rubella, and coronavirus and low antibody titers against cytomegalovirus. Differences in the basic biological and molecular properties of viruses may explain that correlation between HLA antigens and viral antibody titers are either positive or negative. Conversely, as it is now well known that peptides of antigens are associated to HLA-class II molecules in order to be presented to T cells, affinity of virus peptides could vary with different HI.A-class II molecules, giving rise to variable immune responses. This has been shown for influenza matrix peptide [14] .\n\nCorrelations between various HLA antigens, and especially class II antigens, and antibody titers have been reported in normal individuals. Kato et al. [6] suggested that the gene(s) controlling the tow responsiveness to rubella might be located in the sixth chromosome, near the HLA-DR locus. Cohen et al. [7] observed that individuals with HLA-DR1 or HLA-DR5 had significantly higher antibody titers against Epstein-Barr virus capsid and nuclear antigens than those without DR5 or DR1. These studies have been done before HLA-DQwl was identified.\n\nMultiple sclerosis patients differed from controls. In the MS group, viral antibody titers were not related to DQwl, with a remarkable exception for mumps. Therefore, our study suggests that an association between HLA-DQwl and antibody titers against various viruses does exist in normal individuals but is absent in MS patients.\n\nMost of the previous studies on the relationship between HLA antigens and v/ral antibody titers in MS patients have focused on measles virus. Following the study by Jersild et al. [ 15] , which showed an association between high measles antibody titers and HLA-A3, HLA-B7, and HLA-B18 antigens, several negative reports have been published [16] [17] [18] . No relationship was noted between HLA type and measles antibody titers within families with several affected individuals [19] . Poskanser et al. [20] correlated HLA phenotypes with antibodies directed against eight viruses in patients with MS and found no association. These studies have been done in the 1970s when HLA-DR antigens had not yet been defined. To our knowledge, there are no published results on interrelationships between class II antigens and viral antibody titers in MS. But it may be noted that interrelationships between HLA-class II antigens and viral antibody titers have been found in insulin-dependent diabetes [21] and alcoholic cirrhosis [22] .\n\nA clear explanation of our findings is not easy. it may suggest that MS patients have an immunological dysfunction which interfere with the normal control of immune response by genes belonging to or linked with the HLA region. The most attractive hypothesis is that biological and molecular characteristics of DQwl might differ in MS patients. Gene(s) nonlinked to DQ but influencing its function, such as those controlling molecules that are involved in cellular adhesion between T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells, could also play a role in the modification of viral immune response in MS [23] .\n\nA major finding of this study was observed when comparing mumps antibody titers in MS cases and controis. We found that the difference between all MS cases and all controls could be attributed to the difference between all DQwl-positive cases and controls. In contrast, mumps antibodies titers were similar in DQwl-negative MS patients and controls.\n\nSome studies support a possible role of mumps virus in MS. Local synthesis in the central nervous system of oligoclonal antibodies against mumps and other viruses with neurotropic properties has been observed [24] . Several studies including multiple comparisons of viral antibody titers in MS patients and co~,-ols have been done and hxgher titers of mumps antibodies in MS cases than in controls have been reported in some of them [25] . Significant associations may occur by chance and must be interpreted with caution. However, the fact that elevated antibody titers against mumps in MS patients depended on the presence or absence of DQwl, an HLA antigen associated with susceptibility to MS in our population, gives some consistency to our finding. It raises the question as to whether differences in mumps antibody titers between MS patients and controls might be due to particular DQwl characteristics present in these patients, particularly characteristics that might play a role in susceptibility to MS."}
