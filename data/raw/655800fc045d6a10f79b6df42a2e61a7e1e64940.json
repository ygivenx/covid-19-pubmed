{"title": "AEMV FORUM A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY OF 17 CASES OF MYCOBACTERIOSIS IN DOMESTIC FERRETS (MUSTELA PUTORIUS FURO) BETWEEN 2005 AND 2013", "body": "Human infection with NTM is often linked with other diseases or an immunocompromised state. 9, 17, 18 Pathogenicity of NTM in many animals appears to be related to species susceptibility, immune system, the number and virulence of the bacteria, and the means of contamination. Moreover, NTM have also been found in clinically normal animals.\n\nAlthough person-to-person infection with NTM has not been described in humans, animal-toanimal contamination has been described, specifically in fish. [19] [20] [21] Ferret-to-ferret contamination appears unlikely other than through fighting or cannibalism (rare in domestic ferrets). 6, 7 In a case report, 2 infected ferrets lived in the same household but a common source of contagion from the environment was considered more probable than ferret-to-ferret transmission. 10 Contamination from food sources might be possible in ferrets that are fed whole prey.\n\nSeveral methods are used to diagnose mycobacteriosis and include culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and histopathology. Culture on solid media has traditionally been used to isolate and identify mycobacteria, but most species are difficult and slow growing. 11, 22 Some mycobacteria species may also be challenging to identify because of difficulties in differentiating these bacteria from closely related mycobacterial species or from species belonging to genera Corynebacterium, Nocardia, and Rhodococcus. 23 PCR testing is now commonly used to diagnose mycobacterial infection and appears to be a highly reliable diagnostic tool. 23 Mycobacteria are acidfast because of a complex lipid-rich cell wall and a thick mycolic acid layer. In most cases, histopathology demonstrates readily identified, acid-fast intracellular organisms with Ziehl-Neelsen or Fite-Faraco (modified Ziehl-Neelsen) staining.\n\nTreatment of mycobacteriosis is challenging because antibiotics must be adapted to the intracellular particularities of mycobacteria. Several treatments have been described in humans and in ferrets. Question of treatment raises the important issues of zoonotic potential of the mycobacteria identified and the ethics of using antituberculous drugs intended for humans. [24] [25] [26] Few cases of mycobacteriosis have been described in domestic ferrets, with published works primarily being case reports involving 1 or 2 animals (Table 1 ). This article is the first retrospective study in which a substantial number (17 cases) of ferret mycobacteriosis cases have been assessed.\n\nAll ferret cases reviewed in this article were presented to the private practices of both authors between 2005 and 2013. Cases were selected based on either consistent clinical findings (e.g., eyelid edema and respiratory signs) and positive PCR or consistent histopathology with identification of acid-fast bacilli on microscopic examination. PCR was performed on biopsy samples, conjunctival swabs, feces and rectal swabs, or blood. The PCR technique used was based on DNA extraction (digestion bands Bste II and Hae III) followed by qualitative PCR and the restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. The results were interpreted with the aid of the http://app.chuv.ch/pls/pranet/consultation_pkg. resultat_recherche website.\n\nHistopathology was performed on biopsy samples and systematic staining (Ziehl-Neelsen or Fite-Faraco) was used on the collected tissue samples. In suspected cases with consistent histopathology, but without demonstration of acid-fast bacilli, immunohistochemistry was used to exclude cases of systemic coronavirus, which can produce similar lesions. Several cases were excluded from this study by immunohistochemistry. Table 2 .\n\nThe mean age of the ferrets was approximately 4 years but ranged from 11 months to 6.5 years. Only 1 ferret was younger than 1 year (5.88%), 8 ferrets were aged between 1 and 4.5 years (47.06%), and 8 ferrets were older than 4.5 years (46.06%). Age was reported at the time of actual diagnosis and not time of onset of clinical disease signs. Of the 17 ferrets, 8 were female and 9 male. Only 1 animal was intact (male) and all the others had been neutered, surgically or with implantation of deslorelin acetate (Suprelorin; Virbac France, Carros, France). Almost all ferrets had been purchased from pet shops (94.1%). One (5%) was obtained from a private breeder. Each ferret had a different owner.\n\nThe following 3 different groups of lesions were identified: eyelid, respiratory (upper or lower), and digestive. Eyelid lesions included unilateral or bilateral swelling or nictitating membrane, without conjunctival or corneal lesions (Fig. 1) . Patient history included topical ophthalmic treatment failure, with both antibiotic and steroid therapy. In the group with respiratory signs, both upper and lower clinical disease signs were observed. Upper respiratory disease signs included sneezing and increased upper respiratory sounds. Pulmonary signs included dyspnea and coughing. Thoracic radiographic images revealed pleural effusion and patchy pulmonary alveolar densities. In 1 case, lesions were found both in the lungs and in the nasal cavity (Figs. 2 to 4). Digestive tract lesions were identified in the oral cavity, stomach (Fig. 5) , intestine ( Fig. 6) , liver (Fig. 7) , spleen, a mandibular lymph node, and the mesenteric and hepatic lymph nodes (Fig. 8 ). Of the 17 ferrets, 10 (58.82%) presented with lesions identified at only 1 site and 7 (41.18%) presented with lesions in multiple sites. Of the ferrets with lesions identified at only 1 anatomic location, 5 presented with eyelid edema. Complete blood count results were available for 7 animals, but no significant abnormalities typically associated with mycobacteriosis in other animals (e.g., leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and monocytosis) were identified. Similarly, no significant abnormalities were noted in the biochemical profile of the animals tested (5 animals).\n\nPCR was performed on 16 of the 17 ferrets. In the single case where PCR was not performed, diagnosis was made postmortem via histopathology. Of the 16 PCR tests, 15 had positive results, ranging from weakly to strongly positive. The bacterium was further identified in 11 cases. In 2 cases, the owners declined speciation owing to cost. Information for 1 case was unavailable at the time of publication. In 1 case, identification was not possible because of an insufficient amount of DNA retrieved. All the bacteria identified were atypical mycobacteria, and included M. chelonae, Mycobacterium vanbaalenii, Mycobacterium canariense, Mycobacterium shimoidei, Mycobacterium aurum, Mycobacterium vaccae, Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium cosmeticum, and Mycobacterium montefiorense (Table 3) . M. gordonae and M. cosmeticum were identified twice.\n\nHistopathology was performed on samples from 8 cases. Lesions were granulomatous or pyogranulomatous in all cases in which histopathology was used. In all, 7 cases were tested for acid-fast bacilli via Ziehl-Neelsen staining (6 were positive and 1 negative) and 1 case was tested via Fite-Faraco staining. Histopathology was not performed in 9 cases. In 4 of the cases where submitted samples were stained, eyelid lesions highly consistent with mycobacteriosis were present, and the owners also elected to have PCR testing performed. In 2 cases, there was no observable disease lesion that could be collected for histopathological examination. In 1 case, the owner declined surgery. In 2 cases, the excision of a lesion was performed, but owners refused histopathological examination owing to the cost of testing.\n\nAfter identification of the bacteria, all owners were informed of the minimal, but potential zoonotic risk, given that all the mycobacteria identified were atypical. None of the owners opted for euthanasia. Regarding treatment, 2 ferrets were treated with an amoxicillin/clavulanic acid combination at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg, orally every 12 hours (Synulox gouttes; Zoetis France, Paris, France), whereas all the others were treated with enrofloxacin at a dose of 10 mg/kg, orally every 12 hours (Baytril injectable 5%; Bayer Sant\u00e9 Division Animale, Puteaux, France).\n\nOf the 17 ferrets, 3 (17.65%) were considered cured (more than 1 year posttreatment without reoccurrence of clinical disease signs). Of these 3 ferrets, 1 presented with conjunctival edema, 1 with a conjunctival abscess, and 1 with upper respiratory tract signs. There was 1 ferret that was still undergoing treatment at the time of the submission of this article. Of the ferrets included in this study, 14 died (82.35%). Of the 14 ferret deaths, 7 were attributed to mycobacteriosis as no other cause of death was determined, and 7 ferrets (50%) died of disease conditions thought to be unrelated to mycobacteriosis, including 1 that died of insulinoma more than 1 year after diagnosis. Survival of the ferrets in this retrospective clinical review ranged from 10 days to 3.5 years after diagnosis. Mean survival time after diagnosis was 9.4 months.\n\nSource of exposure for all ferrets is unknown, but the authors have speculated as to the risk factors involved. Some of the ferrets were taken outdoors by their owners, but most lived exclusively indoors. Food sources varied. Some ferrets ate chicks and some ate home-prepared meals, whereas most were fed dry kibble only (ferret, cat, or kitten). For ferrets living in groups, no companion ferrets were diagnosed with mycobacteriosis and no owners reported human infection.\n\nFew cases of mycobacteriosis have been described in domestic ferrets (Table 1 ). This article is the first retrospective study of mycobacteriosis in ferrets that involves a substantial number of cases (17) . The results of this retrospective clinical study suggest no age or sex predisposition. The low number of affected younger ferrets is likely because of the chronic nature of mycobacterial infections, as mycobacteriosis is a slow progressing disease (several months to several years). 10 In the cases described in this report, the time between diagnosis and death was often less than 6 months, but most of the animals had a history of disease signs of months to years before the initial clinic presentation.\n\nThere were 3 different groups of lesions identified: those confined to the eyelids, the upper or lower respiratory tract, and/or the gastrointestinal tract. A total of 9 ferrets (56.25%) presented with only 1 lesion site and 7 ferrets (43.75%) presented with multiple lesions sites. The 5 ferrets with a single lesion site were presented for eyelid edema. Complete necropsies were not performed on all ferrets; therefore, the exact extent of lesions in these animals is unknown.\n\nAlthough immunosuppression is linked with expression of disease in humans and other animals, in our cases and other reported cases in ferrets, no severe concomitant disease or immunosuppressive condition was identified. 9, 11 This supports speculation that ferrets may have a natural susceptibility to mycobacterial infection. Source of infection for the ferrets in this report is unknown. Complete history was not available for every animal. In this case series, 5 ferrets were known to live with other ferrets. None of the contact ferrets displayed clinical disease signs that were potentially associated with mycobacteriosis, and some were followed up for many years after diagnosis. Ferret-to-ferret contamination therefore seems unlikely. Furthermore, it is interesting that none of the owners reported mycobacterial infection. In our cases, contamination probably occurred through environmental sources.\n\nIn publications on feral ferrets diagnosed with mycobacteriosis, the primary route of infection appears to be oral. This was the likely route of infection in our cases with gastrointestinal lesions. For the ferrets in this report observed with respiratory and eyelid lesions, the principle route of infection was likely by inhalation or contact with aerosolized particles.\n\nIn cases in which PCR was attempted, 14 of 15 showed positive results. A negative result was obtained for 1 case, but the histopathological results were conclusive for mycobacteriosis. A possible explanation for this negative result was that the sample was obtained by swabbing the conjunctiva and likely contained too few bacteria. In case 4, the initial PCR on a collected conjunctival swab showed negative results, but a second PCR on biopsy samples of the conjunctiva showed positive results and led to the identification of the mycobacteria. The 9 bacteria identified were atypical mycobacteria, and had not been previously described in ferrets. Similar to findings in other published case reports of ferrets diagnosed with mycobacteriosis, no significant changes were found in hematologic or biochemical analysis. 9 When performed on granulomatous or pyogranulomatous lesions, histopathology was consistently effective in disease diagnosis. All but 1 case contained demonstrable acid-fast bacilli. In the case where Ziehl-Neelsen staining showed negative results, the pathologist found the lesions highly consistent with mycobacteriosis, and the PCR result was positive, allowing the diagnosis to be confirmed.\n\nIt should be noted that systemic coronavirus can also produce granulomatous or pyogranulomatous lesions. 27, 28 Immunohistochemistry for coronavirus antigen can help confirm the diagnosis of ferret systemic coronavirus and exclude mycobacteriosis from the disease differential list of the patient. In our study, several cases were excluded based on positive coronavirus immunohistochemistry.\n\nBased on our cases, diagnosis of mycobacteriosis in ferrets should therefore be made based on both the presence of compatible clinical signs (e.g., third eyelid edema and positive PCR, consistent pathology with positive staining). Presentation of mycobacteriosis in ferrets is polymorphous, and variations in clinical disease conditions make it difficult to characterize a single \"mycobacterial disease.\" When collecting biopsy samples of lesions, additional samples should be saved and frozen for potential specific pathogen identification, as repeat biopsy is typically not desirable.\n\nThe question of the zoonotic potential of mycobacterial infection is a key element of the information provided to the owner and of the decision to treat or euthanize. Many mycobacteria can cause diseases in man. The zoonotic risk is clear for bacteria of the M. tuberculosis group. However, for bacteria of the M. avium group or for rapid growing bacteria such as M. fortuitum or M. chelonae, the actual zoonotic risk appears to be minimal for humans with normal immune systems. Most human infections with atypical organisms originate from the environment, and not from other humans or from animals. 11, 29 Nevertheless, precise diagnosis is essential before discussing treatment with an owner. 2 In the cases described in this article, owners were encouraged to pursue mycobacterial identification. In 11 cases where identification was achieved, all identified mycobacteria were atypical mycobacteria. The decision to treat should be made carefully, and in conjunction with the owner's physician. Several treatment protocols have been described in ferrets ( Table 1 ). The ferrets in this report were primarily treated with fluoroquinolones, in particular, enrofloxacin. Enrofloxacin treatment has the advantage of being relatively inexpensive, easily accessible for veterinarians, and easy to administer by owners. In France, fluoroquinolones are considered critical antibiotics, and their use for infection prevention or for minor infections is discouraged; however their use for treatment of mycobacterial infections is likely justified. The use of human antituberculous drugs such as rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, rifabutin, or ethambutol could be considered, but there may be serious ethical concerns regarding the use of these drugs, as antibiotic resistance is of critical concern. 25,26 Another antibiotic to consider is azithromycin, which is well tolerated in ferrets and can be used in association with fluoroquinolones. Existing information regarding the typical susceptibility of each bacterium in humans can also help with antimicrobial selection. The use of interferon should also be investigated. It has been suggested that interferon-gamma may play an important role in host resistance to mycobacteria. 30, 31 Human interferon alpha-A, which is inexpensive and easy to use, has proved useful in containing or treating other ferret diseases such as systemic coronavirus infection (authors' personal observations) and should be investigated as a concurrent treatment for mycobacteriosis. The slow growth of mycobacterial organisms necessitates long-term treatment, in some cases, many months. Gauging treatment success is difficult. In the cases assessed in this case series, treatment ended with the death of the animal or after more than 1 year without return of clinical disease signs.\n\nThis article is the first retrospective description of multiple cases of mycobacteriosis in domestic ferrets. Mycobacteriosis may infect ferrets more commonly than once previously thought; it is also likely being underdiagnosed. The aim of the article is to illustrate the polymorphous aspect of the disease and the number of cases diagnosed at the veterinary clinics involved. Veterinarians should include mycobacteriosis in their differential disease diagnoses of ferret patients that present with eyelid swelling, upper and lower respiratory disease, and digestive diseases. For cases of abdominal pyogranulomatous lesions, mycobacteriosis should also be considered along with systemic coronavirus infection. "}
