{"title": "Polycistronic Animal Virus mRNAs", "body": "proteins are produced in animal cells (1-3, [7] [8] [9] . Now In this essay, I review some observations concerning the natural occurrence and structural organization of polycistronic animal virus mRNAs, and the mechanisms by which they may be translated to yield two or more unique polypeptide products.\n\nMost animal virus mRNAs characterized so far are functionally monocistronic. However, functionally polycistronic animal virus mRNAs also exist. Initiation of translation in monocistronic viral mRNAs most commonly occurs at AUG and, furthermore, at the 5'-proximal AUG (5-7, 10, 11) . In most polycistronic viral mRNAs, initiation of translation of both the 5'-proximal, upstream cistron and the internal, downstream cistron(s) likewise occurs at an AUG codon ( (Table I) . They include: viruses with DNA genomes and viruses with RNA genomes; viruses with circular genomes and viruses with linear genomes; viruses whose genomes are constituted by a single piece of nucleic acid as well as viruses with segmented genomes; and viruses that utilize the cell nucleus as the site for mRNA biogenesis as well as viruses whose mRNA is synthesized in the cytoplasm.\n\nThe identification and characterization of polycistronic mRNAs have been greatly facilitated by the availability of nucleotide se-quences derived from cDNA clones of viral mRNAs. From these cDNA sequences, it has been possible to identify potential initiation and termination codons and open reading frames capable of encoding polypeptide products of a predicted size. The availability of these cDNA clones has also permitted the construction of various types of vectors for translational studies, including in vivo expression vectors and in vitro transcription vectors. Eukaryotic expression vectors using various high-efficiency promoters have made possible the analysis of protein synthesis in vivo using constructions that encode chimeric mRNAs possessing defined mutations in regions of potential regulatory importance, and/or chimeric mRNAs specifying \"reporter\" genes that facilitate assays for translational expression. In vitro transcription vectors with SP6 and T7 promoters have made possible the efficient synthesis of wild-type and mutant mRNAs that can be examined for their translational activity with a variety of different cell-free proteinsynthesizing systems. In addition, the ability to identify and quantitate the expression within infected or transfected cells of proteins predicted from cDNA sequences has been facilitated by the production of antibodies against synthetic peptides having the amino-acid sequences deduced from open reading frames revealed by cDNA sequence data, and antibodies produced against recombinant fusion proteins produced in bacteria. Primer extension analysis, S 1protection analysis, and RNA \"blotting\" and hybridization have been used to demonstrate the presence of mRNAs in uiuo that possess a particular 5' region in which potential translation initiation codons are localized. Thus, much experimental evidence exists for the occurrence of functionally polycistronic mRNAs, specific examples of which are considered in the following section, which emphasizes their possible mechanisms of expression.\n\nLeaky Scanning\n\nThe scanning model provides a conceptual framework for understanding the process of initiation of mRNA translation in animal cells.\n\nAccording to the scanning model, a 403 ribosomal subunit binds at or near the 5' end of an mRNA and advances linearly until an initiation codon in a favorable context is reached, at which point assembly of a complete 80-S ribosomes takes place and initiation of polypeptide synthesis occurs (5, 10, 12, 80) . The efficiency of initiation of transla- tion is thought to be modulated, at least in part, by the position and context of the initiation codon (5, 10, 12, (80) (81) (82) (83) . If the 5'-proximal initiation codon is in an optimal context, initiation at that codon is efficient. If the context of the 5'-proximal initiation codon is suboptimal, initiation at that codon is inefficient. Although a fraction of the scanning ribosomes may indeed initiate translation at a suboptimal 5'-proximal initiation codon, a portion of the 4 0 3 ribosomal subunits would presumably bypass the suboptimal codon and initiate downstream at an internal AUG codon positioned in a more favorable context. This \"leaky scanning\" model provides a mechanism for the initiation of translation at internal initiation codons that would be present in polycistronic mRNAs (12) .\n\nConsiderable evidence consistent with the leaky scanning model for initiation of translation has accumulated. This evidence includes the unique 5'-terminal m7G(5')ppp(5')N . . . cap structure characteristic of most animal virus and cell mRNAs, a structure that often significantly stimulates translation in many types of cell-free proteinsynthesizing systems (84) (85) (86) ; the inability of ribosomes to bind and translate synthetic circular mRNAs (87, 88) ; the ability of 4 0 4 ribosomal subunits to migrate along mRNA (89, 90) ; the inhibitory effect on translation-initiation of synthetic secondary structures inserted upstream from an \"authentic\" initiation codon (91) (92) (93) (94) (95) ; and the inhibitory effect on translation of AUG initiation codons inserted upstream from an \"authentic\" initiation codon (83, (96) (97) (98) (99) .\n\nBy inspection of sequences near the 5' ends of animal cell and viral mRNAs (5, 11, 80, 81) and by site-directed mutagenesis of a cDNA copy of a cellular gene (82, 83) , two nucleotide postions relative to the initiation codon were found to have a dominant effect on the efficiency of initiation: position -3 (three nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon), and position +4 (immediately following the initiation codon). A purine in position -3 and a guanine in position +4 were optimal for efficient initiation at 5'-proximal AUG codons. Furthermore, the efficiency of initiation was, to a large extent, modulated by the context-that is, the -3/+4 nucleotide positions flanking the 5'-proximal AUG-rather than by the relative distance of the AUG from the 5' end of the mRNA (S, 10-12, [80] [81] [82] [83] .\n\nFor several of the polycistronic animal virus mRNAs, the initiation codon of the 5'-proximal upstream cistron is present in a suboptimal context with regard to the -3/+4 flanking nucleotides, whereas the initiation codon of the internal downstream cistron is often, but not always, present in an optimal -3/+4 context. Thus, some of the scanning 40-S ribosomal subunits would presumably be able to \"leak\" past the suboptimal initiation site of the upstream cistron and con-tinue scanning until reaching the optimal initiation site of the downstream cistron, present in either the same or a different reading frame. The relative efficiency of utilization of the upstream and downstream cistron initiation codons by ribosomes scanning the same mRNA is of possible regulatory importance, as certain polycistronic mRNAs appear to be organized so that the relative abundance of the proteins encoded by different cistrons correlates with the relative strength of the nucleotides flanking the initiation sites of the cistrons.\n\nOne mechanism by which one gene can encode two forms of a protein that differ only in the amino-terminal region is the production of one mRNA transcript from which translation initiation can occur alternatively at one of two in-frame initiation codons. A number of animal virus genes encode mRNA species in which different in-frame AUG initiation sites are utilized in a manner such as to generate related protein products that differ in their amino-terminal sequences. For example, the following viral polycistronic mRNAs each encode two or more proteins in the same reading frame: simian virus 40 (SV40) late 19-S mRNAs encoding capsid proteins VP2 and VP3 (13-1 5) ; the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene mRNA encoding 17) ; the human T-cell leukemia virus subgenomic mRNA encoding the rex and tax nonstructural regulatory proteins (1 8) ; the rotavirus segment8 mRNA encoding 38-kDa and 35-kDa VP7 capsid glycoproteins (19) ; and the Newcastle disease virus mRNA encoding capsid phosphoprotein P and nonstructural 38-and 29-kDa C-like nonstructural proteins (20) . In each of these cases (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) , the upstream or 5'-proximal AUG initiation site is in a suboptimal -3/+4 context relative to the downstream AUG initiation site. (21, 32) ; and the reovirus S1 mRNA 5'-proximal AUG encoding the less abundant sigma-1 protein is in a weak -3/+4 context as compared to the internal AUG encoding sigma-lNs, which is in a strong context and is more efficiently synthesized in vitro than is sigma-1 (40-44, 103). suggest that nucleotides other than the previously identified consensus context nucleotides flanking the initiator AUG codon at the -3 (purine) and +4 (guanine) positions are also important and perhaps even play a dominant role in determining the efficiency of translation in animal cells. Conceivably, mRNA primary or higher ordered structures responsible for the differential ability of mRNAs to interact with mRNA binding initiation factors such as eIF-4A and eIF-4F may, in some cases, be a major determinant of the translational efficiency of 5'-capped mRNAs (86, 100) . Thus, the selection of an \"authentic\" initiation codon with an appropriate efficiency may well be the consequence of collective contributions of many parameters, including both cis-acting sequences such as the -3/+4 context nucleotides, and truns-acting components such as protein synthesis-initiation factors that may discriminate among different mRNAs by virtue of different mRNA binding affinities.\n\nBinding of 40-S ribosomal subunits to internal sequences within the body of a polycistronic mRNA, rather than binding to the 5' end of the mRNA as proposed by the modified scanning model, would provide a mechanism by which translation-initiation could occur from initiation codons positioned downstream from the 5'-proximal AUG codons. Among the best evidence for internal initiation of translation is that obtained with picornavirus mRNAs, both in vitro and in vivo (101, 102) .\n\nPicornaviruses possess nonsegmented, plus-strand RNA genomes of about 7500 nucleotides (6) . Although picornavirus mRNAs appear functionally monocistronic in that a single large polypeptide precursor is synthesized that undergoes posttranslational proteolytic cleavages to generate the mature protein products (9) , studies with poliovirus (101, 104) and encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus (102, 105) suggest that initiation of translation occurs by a cap-independent mechanism that involves internal binding of ribosomes.\n\nThe 5'-noncoding region of poliovirus mRNA is unusually long, about 750 nucleotides, and contains several AUG codons upstream from the major initiator AUG located at nucleotide 743 (106) (107) (108) (109) . (120) . Furthermore, the initiation of translation of 5'capped cellular and viral mRNAs is inhibited in poliovirus-infected cells. The inhibition mechanism appears to involve a proteolytic inactivation of the p220 subunit of eIF-4F, the cap-binding complex initiation factor required for ribosomes to bind to the 5' terminus and subsequently to initiate the translation of capped mRNAs (110, 111) .\n\nBiochemical and genetic analysis of poliovirus mutants generated using a cDNA copy of the viral genome revealed regions within the 5'-noncoding region of poliovirus mRNA important for the efficient translation of the viral mRNA (101, (112) (113) (114) (115) . Surprisingly (136) . By contrast, analysis of a series of poliovirus deletion mutants identified a functional cis-acting element within the 5'-untranslated sequences of poliovirus mRNA that enables it to translate in a cap-independent manner (112, 113, 115) . The major determinant of the polio capindependent translational element maps between nucleotides 320 and 631 from the 5' end of the poliovirus mRNA and is functional both in vivo (113) and in vitro (112, 113) . Translation in vitro of SP6 transcripts containing additional deletions in the 5'-noncoding region more narrowly focused the cis-acting element responsible for capindependent translation, as measured in a mixed rabbit reticulocyte-HeLa system, to a 60-nucleotide sequence located between positions 567 and 627 (115) . The (101) . The second cistron is not expressed when the CAT 5'-untranslated region is the intercistronic spacer (101) . Deletion analysis of the poliovirus 5'-untranslated region suggests that the internal ribosome binding site occupies several hundred nucleotides located between nucleotides 140 and 630 of the poliovirus 5'-untranslated region (101) . It is unclear whether internal ribosome binding is directed toward a specific AUG or whether the internal binding is followed by scanning. However, because the introduction of a hairpin secondary structure (AG\" = -30 kcal/mol) at position 631 of the polio RNA dramatically inhibits translation initiation from the downstream AUG, it has been proposed that the ribosomes, following internal binding, are translocated by scanning until they reach the initiator AUG located at position 745 of the poliovirus mRNA (101) .\n\nInternal ribosome binding can also occur to picornavirus mRNAs in vitro (131) . In HeLa cell extracts, internal binding to the 5'noncoding region of poliovirus mRNA in a bicistronic context is independent of an upstream open reading frame (139) . Data obtained with EMC virus RNA are also consistent with an internal binding of ribosomes to mRNA that is followed by scanning toward the initiator AUG site (102, 105) . It appears that internal initiation sites are also utilized during the translation in vitro of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) NS mRNA encoding the phosphoprotein NS(P) (55), adenovirus mRNA encoding the viral DNA polymerase (56) , and hepatitis B virus (HBV) pregenomic mRNA encoding the viral reverse transcriptase (141) . In the case of HBV, combined genetic and biochemical studies both in cell culture and in ducks reveal that the reverse transcriptase is synthesized by a mechanism involving translation initiation at an internal pol AUG codon rather than by ribosomal frameshifting within the core-pol overlap (141) . In these cases, the internal initiation occurs at an AUG positioned several hundred nucleotides downstream from, but in-frame with, the 5'-proximal AUG. Synthesis of the VSV 7-kDa (55) and the adenovirus 62-kDa (56) (116) .\n\nA highly significant sequence similarity extends through the 5'-noncoding region of the three poliovirus serotypes, PV1, PV2, and PV3 (108, 117) . Furthermore \n\nThese two factors, together with ATP, are normally specifically required for the binding of 5'-capped mRNA to the 43-S ribosome complex (119) (120) (121) . The eIF-4A is an ATP-dependent singlestranded RNA-binding protein that displays mRNA-dependent ATPiase activity (119) ; eIF-4F is the three-subunit cap-binding protein (CBP) complex that includes eIF-4A, the CBP eIF-4E, and p220 (120) ; and, eIF-4B is a factor whose exact function remains unknown, but which appears to stimulate the activities of eIF-4A and eIF-4F and to function in the binding of mRNA to the 43 \n\nIn the absence of eIF-4F, both eIF-4A and eIF-4B can bind to an uncapped synthetic mRNA lacking secondary structure with essentially the same degree of effectiveness and affinity observed for capped natural mRNA in the presence of all three factors (118) .\n\nAdeno-associated virus is a defective parvovirus that replicates in the nucleus of human cells in culture coinfected with adenovirus. The genome of AAV is single-stranded DNA, either plus or minus (6) . The AAV capsid protein synthesis was the first of non-AUG initiation described for animal cells. From the sequence of the AAV2 genome (57) , the structure of the mRNAs that encode the capsid proteins (S8, 59) , and the amino-terminal sequence of the AAV capsid protein B (24) , it has been concluded that the synthesis of the AAV capsid protein B is initiated at an ACG codon (24, 25) .\n\nInterestingly, in the case of the cellular dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) mRNA, substitution of ACG for the normal AUG translation codon leads to the synthesis of a normal DHFR protein both in oivo and in vitro (122). I n addition, a truncated form of DHFR is also produced, apparently by initiation at the next in-frame AUG located downstream from the ACG. Initiation of DHFR mRNA translation at the ACG codon depends upon a favorable -3/+4 sequence context (122).\n\nSendai virus possesses a nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA genome and replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells (6 175 (21, 22) . The efficiency of synthesis in uivo of the C' protein from the 5'-proximal ACG differs less than 2-fold from that of the P protein expressed from the downstream AUG, whereas the amount of C protein synthesized is four to five times that of P protein (21, 32) . These results suggest that an ACG in an otherwise favorable -3/+4 context can function almost as efficiently for initiation of translation as an AUG codon in a less favorable -3/+4 context, by only about 10 to 20% as'efficiently as an AUG in a more favored context. The ACG initiator codon of the P/C mRNA appears to be even more efficiently utilized in vitro than it is in uivo (32, 60) . Proteins Y 1 and Y2 are both expressed in vivo, although less efficiently than P protein (N. Gupta, personal communication) . Neither the Y 1 nor the Y2 AUG initiation codon is in a favorable context for efficient initiation, as pyrimidines are present in the -3 and +4 positions of both AUGs (21, 22) .\n\nfrom exon 2 through exon 3; exon 1 lacks any AUG codons. Two major forms of C-myc proteins have been identified that, depending upon the species of cell analyzed, differ by 2 to 4 kDa in apparent mass (123, 124) . These two proteins are derived from alternative translational initiations in the same reading frame in exons 1 and 2. Site-specific mutagenesis results show that initiation of translation of capped SP6 or T7 transcripts in vitro occurs at an AUG codon in exon 2 and at a CUG codon near the 3' end of exon 1. The initiation of translation from the exon-1 CUG and from the downstream exon-2 AUG results in the production of c-myc proteins with distinct amino-termini (26) . Analysis of c-myc proteins synthesized in Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines containing different chromosomal translocations, and in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines that do not have a rearranged c-myc locus, suggests that alternative CUG and AUG translation-initiation sites are used in vivo as well as in vitro (26) .\n\nRibosomal frameshifting during the elongation stage of mRNA translation provides a mechanism for the synthesis of a single protein from two different reading frames on an RNA template. The coupling of the reading frames requires that the ribosome shifts correctly from one reading frame to the other at a discrete position on the mRNA so as to avoid termination of polypeptide synthesis (125) . Frameshifting permits the production of two unique polypeptide products from a single mRNA by initiation of translation at a single site, but subsequent termination of translation at different sites in different reading frames. Termination of protein synthesis at different sites is the result of translational frameshifting that causes a fraction of the ribosomes to change reading frame at a discrete position on the mRNA. Several retroviruses utilize such a frameshifting strategy Most, if not all, retroviruses express the gag-encoded viral core proteins in the form of a gag-polyprotein precursor that is processed by a virus-encoded protease; the pol-encoded reverse transcriptase and integrase proteins are normally expressed at much lower levels by a similar proteolytic processing of a large, fused gag-pol precursor polypeptide (103,126) . However, the genetic structure of the gag-pol domains of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) genome (61) , the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I and -11) genomes (62) , the bovine leukemia virus genome (63) , the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) genome (64) , and the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) genome (65) seemingly would preclude the synthesis of a gag-pol fusion protein, because the gag and pol genes are in different reading frames. The pol gene of RSV and HIV is in the -1 reading frame with (61 -68) .\n\nrespect to the gag gene; however, the products of pol do not arise from independent translation-initiation events or from the translation of a spliced mRNA, but rather because of a ribosomal frameshifting event during gag-pol expression (61, 64) . In MMTV, two -1 frameshift events are required for the synthesis of the gag-pol fusion protein, one at the gag-xlpro overlap and the other at the xlpro-pol overlap (65, 66) . The frameshifting model is supported by synthesis of both the gag protein and the gag-pol fusion protein in an animal cell-free protein-synthesizing system in vitro using a single RSV, HIV, or MMTV mRNA template synthesized in vitro from cloned viral cDNA by SP6 polymerase.\n\nSite-directed mutagenesis and amino-acid sequencing located the site of HIV gag-pol frameshifting at a leucine UUA codon within a U-UUA sequence near the 5' end of the gag-pol overlap region (64) . The same sequence also appears in the gag-pol overlap of RSV (61) and the pro-pol overlap of MMTV (65, 66) . The exact molecular mechanism of translational frameshifting in animal cell systems is not yet known, but in RSV, HIV and MMTV, the frameshifting events may involve a slippage of the leucyl-tRNA reading the UUA codon back to the -1-frame UUU codon (64, 137) . However, a larger sequence context, possibly including secondary structure within the region flanking the site of the frameshift event, also appears necessary for frameshifting, because synthetic oligonucleotides containing either of the MMTV overlap regions inserted into novel contexts do not induce frameshifting (66) . Indeed, the effects of deletion and sitedirected mutations best correlate with the potential to form an RNA stem-loop structure adjacent to the frame-shift site. A 147-nucleotide sequence from RSV RNA containing the frameshift site and stemloop structure is sufficient to direct frameshifting in a novel genetic context (137). The efficiency of ribosomal frameshifting during translation of the mRNA encoding gag and the gag-pol fusion is about 5% within the RSV gag-pol overlap (61) and about 10% within the HIV gag-pol overlap (64) . By contrast, in MMTV, about 25% of the ribosomes traversing the gag-rlpro overlap and 10% traversing the x-prolpol overlap frameshift in the -1 direction (66) .\n\nThe genetic structure of the gag-pol domains of the murine leukemia virus (MuLV) (67) and the feline leukemia virus (FeLV) (68) genomes precludes the synthesis of the gag-pol fusion protein because gag and p o l are separated by an in-frame nonsense codon. To circumvent this apparent block to synthesis of the gag-pol leukemia virus fusion proteins, MuLV and FeLV utilize a strategy of termination codon suppression in which ribosomes \"read-through\" the inframe stop codon. The MuLV protease is located at the 5' end of the pol gene and is synthesized within the precursor gag-pol fusion protein by suppression of an amber (WAG) termination codon located at the 3' end of the gag gene (67) . The first four amino-terminal amino acids of the protease are derived from the gag gene; the fifth residue, glutamine, is derived through suppression of the in-frame amber termination codon located at the gag-pol junction (67) . Similar to MuLV (67) , the FeLV protease is likewise synthesized through in-frame suppression of the gag amber termination codon by insertion of a glutamine residue at the UAG codon (68) . Based on precedents from prokaryotic systems, natural suppression of the nonsense termination codon present in the MuLV and FeLV mRNAs presumably occurs by a mechanism involving suppressor tRNAs that possess altered anticodons (127) . Normal mouse cells contain a natural WAG suppressor glutamine tRNA, representing about 1-2% of the total glutamine tRNA (133, 134) . The supressor glutamine tRNA may be increased in some cells infected with MuLV (133) and selectively decreased in cells treated with Avarol,' a sesquiterpenoid hydroquinone displaying anti-MuLV activity (134) . Indeed, nonsense suppressor tRNAs active in mammalian cells have been constructed using site-specific mutagenesis of cloned tRNA genes. The biological activity of these recombinant suppressor tRNAs was directly demonstrated by suppression of termination of nonsense codons introduced into cDNA clones encoding animal virus mRNAs (128) (129) (130) . However, in principle, either the primary or a higher ordered structure of the MuLV or FeLV mRNA templates could also affect the efficiency of suppression of termination by affecting the competition between the protein-synthesis release factors promoting termination and the tRNA species mediating suppression by promoting read-through. Analysis of recombinant fusion genes consisting of the viral gag-pol junction upstream and in the same reading frame as the E . coli l a d gene revealed that gag amber codon suppression in these constructs does not require augmented levels of suppressor tRNA species (98) . Rather, suppression is caused by an intrinsic cis-acting component of the viral mRNA (98) .\n\nAvarol is a highly reduced, highly methylated nephthalenylmethyl-l, [Eds.].\n\nIn polycistronic mRNAs with open reading frames or cistrons that do not overlap, reinitiation without prior dissociation of the 404 subunit from the mRNA following termination of translation of the upstream cistron would provide a possible mechanism for the subsequent initiation of translation of the downstream cistron. Such reinitiation following termination by animal cell ribosomes has been shown to occur with several viral and cellular mRNAs (69) (70) (71) (72) (73) (74) (75) (76) (77) 79) .\n\nFurthermore, termination-reinitiation of translation has been implicated as a possible negative regulatory mechanism in the expression of certain viral mRNAs [for example, the B19 parvovirus VP1 RNA (70) , a cytomegalovirus (CMV) p mRNA (79) , SV40 early mRNA (69) , and the RSV src mRNA (72)l.\n\nThe B19 parvovirus produces two capsid proteins in strikingly different quantities-VP1 (<4%) and VP2 (>96%)-from overlapping RNAs that are derived from the same transcriptional unit (71) . Translation of the VP1 RNA is very inefficient compared to VP2 RNA in the reticulocyte cell-free system. The region about 250 nucleotides upstream from the VP1 initiation AUG codon contains seven AUG codons followed by in-frame termination codons that create multiple minicistrons; this region is removed by splicing and is not present in the efficiently translated VP2 RNA. The multiple upstream AUG codons of the VP1 RNA negatively regulate VP1 synthesis (70) . Removal (70) . Although the upstream AUG-rich region of the VP1 RNA behaves as a negative regulatory element in translational control, no significant difference is observed when the termination site of the last minicistron precedes rather than overlaps the authentic VP1 AUG initiation codon (70) . Because some of the upstream AUG codons in the B19 VP1 RNA are present in an appropriate -3/+4 context for translation-initiation (71) , it was proposed that reinitiation rather than leaky scanning is mainly responsible for the reduced efficiency of VP1 translation (70) .\n\nSV40 (69) and CMV (79) , similar to B19 papovavirus (70) , also possess upstream \"leader\" minicistrons that display a negative regulatory activity for mRNA translation. The SV40 early region encodes two proteins, \"large T\" and \"small t,\" from mRNAs that share common 5'-noncoding regions (132) . During (76) . The insertion of AUG initiation codons upstream from the \"authentic\" AUG used to initiate translation of the downstream HB,Ag gene could severely depress the initiation of translation at the \"authentic\" AUG codon. Such inhibition could, however, be at least partially suppressed by the presence of a translational termination codon in-frame with the upstream AUG (76) . These (74, 75, 77) , but not always (75, 77) , markedly reduces the efficiency of translation of a downstream cistron. Furthermore, the relative position of the terminator codon of the upstream cistron's open reading frame appears to be a critical parameter in determining expression from the downstream, internal cistron. Some evidence suggests that efficient reinitiation of translation can occur at an internal downstream AUG if the translation that initiated from the upstream AUG codon terminates about 80 to 150 nucleotides before the downstream AUG (77) . However, other evidence suggests that reinitiation can occur at an internal AUG if the translation that initiated from the upstream AUG codon terminates within about 20 to 50 nucleotides either before or after the downstream AUG (74, 75) . Although the maximum intercistronic distance over which an animal cell ribosome may reinitiate has not been precisely resolved (75, 77) , these latter results (74, 75) imply that ribosomes may also be able to \"reach back\" or scan bidirectionally.\n\nIn summary, the results of many studies designed to assess the effects of upstream initiation and termination codons on downstream translation-initiation are consistent collectively with the notion that internal initiation of translation may occur by a mechanism involving translation termination-reinitiation. Translation termi-nation-reinitiation may occur when the termination codon of the upstream cistron either precedes or is in the close vicinity of the initiation site of the downstream second cistron. The evidence supporting reinitiation following termination is derived from a number of different translational systems, both in ~i t r o and in ~i o o , and for both viral and cellular mRNAs (69) (70) (71) (72) (73) (74) (75) (76) (77) 79) . Hopefully, future studies will establish which of the multiple mechanisms so far described for the translation of polycistronic animal virus mRNAs are used likewise for the translation of polycistronic cellular mRNAs. Future studies may also better identify and characterize the parameters important in the regulated translation of polycistronic mRNAs, parameters including cis-acting primary sequences or higher ordered structures of the mRNA, and trans-acting protein factors of the protein-synthesis machinery."}
