{"title": "Nucleotide Sequence of Bovine Rotavirus Gene 1 and Expression of the Gene Product in Baculovirus", "body": "Rotaviruses, members of a genus of the Reoviridae family, possess a genome containing 11 segments of double-stranded RNA. The 11 segments of genomic RNA code for structural proteins found in viral particles and for nonstructural (NS53, NS35, NS34, and NS28) proteins found only in infected cells. Nucleotide sequences have been reported (for one or another rotavirus strain) for the RNA segments 4 to 11 (Both et al., 1982 (Both et al., , 1983a (Both et al., ,b, 1984 lmai eta/., 1983; Estes et a/., 1984; Kantharidis et al., 1987; Bremont et a/., 1987) . In this work molecular characterization of the bovine rotavirus RF strain has been continued and we report the complete nucleotide sequence of gene 1 of bovine rotavirus (RF strain) that codes for the internal structural protein VP1 Three types of rotaviral particles have been described. Complete infectious particles possess a double capsid. Removal of the outer proteins produces a single-shelled capsid that contains four,proteins: VP1 (125K), VP2 (90K), VP3 (88K), and VP6 (41 K). Treatment of these particles with chaotropic agents removes the major protein VP6 of the single-shelled particles and ' To whom requests for reprints should be addressed. Sequence Data from this article have been deposited with the EMBL/GenBank Data Libraries under Accession No. J04346. produces core particles (Bican eta/., 1982) . Three polypeptides are associated with cores (Liu et al., 1988) . VP2 is the major component of cores and has been shown to bind RNA (Boyle and Holmes, 1986) . VP1 represents only 2% of the viral protein moiety of the complete virion and probably does not act as a scaffolding protein. As a minor component of single-shelled particles, VP1 could function as pat-t of the transcriptase present in activated particles. VP1 with VP2, VP6, and two nonstructural proteins is also a component of subviral particles containing replicase activity (Patton and Gallegos, 1988) . Temperature-sensitive mutants which map to genome segment 1 have RNA-negative phenotypes (Gombold and Ramig, 1987) . These observations support a putative enzymatic role for VPl.\n\nNo information on the gene 1 structure and its protein product is available to date and we report here its nucleotide sequence. We also inserted a full-length gene 1 cDNA into the genome of the baculovirus Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) adjacent to the strong polyhedrin promoter. In this construct, VP1 was expressed efficiently, and immunologic analysis indicated that the protein possessed native antigenic determinants and was immunogenic. The availability of large amounts of VP1 will help determine intrinsic properties of this protein in the rotavirus replication process. 1. Construction of baculovirus expression vectors for rotavirus gene 1. The full-length rotavirus gene 1 cDNA clone M 13mpl g/RF 1 was digested with Smal and cloned either in the Smal site of pAC461 or in the filled in BarnHI site of pVL941 by blunt-end ligation. The resultants vectors, pAC461/RFl and pVL941/RFl, contain the gene 1 coding region fused to the polyhedrin sequence, respectively, at position -7 and +34. The mutated initiation codon of the polyhedrin gene in pVL941 is circled. (m) Rotavirus gene 1 sequence; (Cl) pUC 8 sequence.\n\nThe RF strain of bovine rotavirus was propagated in MA 104 cells, as described previously (L'Haridon and Scherrer, 1976) . AcNPV and recombinant virus stocks were grown and assayed in confluent monolayers of Spodoptera frugiperda cells in Hanks' medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) according to the procedures described by Summers and Smith (1987) (Estes et al., 1987) .\n\nGenomic dsRNAs were isolated from purified viruses by extraction with phenol and precipitation with ethanol. For cDNA synthesis the genomic RNA was polyadenylated in vitro at its 3'-end and first-strand synthesis with reverse transcription was primed with oligo (dT),2-,8. Cloning in pBR322 has been described previously .\n\nPlasmid DNA manipulations were carried out essentially as summarized by Maniatis et a/. (1982) . Restric-tion enzymes were purchased from Biolabs (Beverly, MA). T4 DNA ligase, Klenow large fragment of DNA polymerase, and calf intestinal phosphatase were obtained from Boehringer-Mannheim (FRG). The nucleotide sequence was determined using the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger et al. (1977) and the shotgun strategy after subcloning random fragments in Ml 3 phage (Gardner et a/., 1981) . Three overlapping (partial) clones were sequenced. Each base was read with an average of six independent Ml3 mpl9 subclones. The program \"Microgenie\" was employed to analyze the sequence data generated by the shotgun cloning strategy (Beckman, France).\n\nInstead of reconstructing a full-length clone from the three partial clones used for sequencing, we obtained a full-length clone by a different strategy: Two oligonucleotides (41 -mer and 30-mer) corresponding respectively to 5'-and 3'-end sequences plus the cohesive sequence of Xrnal restriction endonuclease were synthetized using a \"Biosearch 8700\" synthetizer. These unphosphorylated oligonucleotides were used to prime the synthesis of cDNA on the plus and the minus strands and also to allow ligation in the unique Xmal site of M 13 mpl9 of the reannealed double-stranded cDNA. The first five clear plaques obained appeared to be full-length as the Smal excised insert was about 3300 bp long. One of these clones Ml3 mplS/RFlA was partially sequenced to verify that the ends of the gene were complete.\n\nThe full-length clone M 13 mpl g/RF1 A was digested with Smal and subcloned either into the Smal site of the baculovirus transfer vector pAC461 or in the Klenow filled-in BarnHI site of the transfer vector pVL941 (Fig. 1) . After transfection into fscherichia co/i (strain DHSa), ampicillin-resistant colonies were screened for correct orientation of the gene 1 insert by restriction analysis (digestion by EcoRV and Bg/ll). Baculovirus recombinants were obtained by cotransfecting S. frugiperda cells with transfer vector and wildtype AcNPV DNA using the in situ phosphate calcium precipitation procedure: approximately 2 pg of recombinant transfer vector and 4 pg of wild-type viral DNA in 750 ~1 of transfection buffer (25 mn/r HEPES, pH 7.1; 140 m M NaCI; 125 m M CaCI,) were added to 25-cm2 flasks seeded with 2.5 X lo6 S. frugiperda cells and containing 750 ~1 of Grace's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Following incubation at 27\" for 4 hr, the medium was replaced by 5 ml of fresh Hinks' medium containing 10% FBS, and incubation was continued for 5 days. Thereafter extracellular virus was harvested and titrated by limiting dilution in 96-well microtiter plates containing S. frugiperda cell monolayers. The supernatant of wells of the highest dilution of sample found to be positive in a dot blot assay using a gene 1 32P-labeled probe was titrated again by limiting dilution and the supernatant was plaqued on a monolayer of S. frugiperda cells. Virus in polyhedrin-negative plaques was plaque-purified three times and used to propagate virus stocks. For each transfer vector, three indepen-dent recombinant viruses designated pAC461/RFl .l to pAC461/RFl.3 and pVL941IRFl .l to pVL941/RFl.3 were prepared.\n\nProtein analysis and immunoprecipitation S. frugiperda cells in 25-cm* flasks were infected at a high multiplicity (35 PFU/cell) with wild-type AcNPV or with recombinant virus and labeled with [35S]methionine (15 &i/ml, 1200 Ci/mmol; Amersham) for 2 hr at the indicated time using Grace's medium. Prior to labeling, the cells were incubated for 30 min with Grace's medium. After the labeling period, the medium was removed and the cells were pelleted at 1600 g at 4' for 10 min. For analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the cells were lysed by boiling for 10 min in dissociation buffer (2% SDS, 0.5 M urea, 10% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 62.5 mM Tris-HCI, 0.01% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8). For immunoprecipitation analysis, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCI, 20 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.4) 10 mM EDTA, 1% aprotinin, 1% Triton X-l 00, 1 o/o sodium deoxycholate; 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) and sonicated for 10 set (Ericson et al., 1983) . The sonicate was centrifuged at 13,000 g for 10 min. A cytosol fraction of rotavirus-infected Ma1 04 cells was prepared similarly except that centrifugation was at 100,000 g for 1 hr. For immunoprecipitation, purified rabbit anti-rotavirus IgG (raised against cesium chloride-purified bovine rotavirus) were diluted in RIPA buffer and mixed with 100 ~1 of [35S]methionine-labeled cell extract. Samples were incubated for 1 hr at 37\", protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia; 80 ~1 of a 15% suspension in 50 mn/r Tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 10 mM EDTA, 0.5 M NaCI) was added, and mixing was continued for 1 hr at room temperature. The Sepharose beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed three times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer and once with 10 mM Tris-HCI (pH 7.5) and finally boiled for 5 min in 30 ~1 of SDS electrophoresis dissociation buffer before analysis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels.\n\nGuinea pigs shown to lack rotavirus antibodies were used for the production of antiserum to recombinant VP1 protein. Each guinea pig was inoculated intramuscularly twice at 2-week intervals as previously described (Estes et al., 1979) . The antigen used was a cytosol fraction of infected Sf9 cells harvested 48 hr postinfection. Cells were washed, resuspended in PBS containing lo/o NP-40, sonicated, and clarified and the supernatant was mixed with adjuvant for immunization. The guinea pigs were bled 10 days after the third injection. S. frugiperda cells infected at various times with pVL941/RFl .l were detached from the flask by pipetting, pelleted at low speed, and fixed for 1 hr with 1.6% glutaraldehyde. The cell pellet was washed three times in cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) then postfixed in 19/o osmium tetroxide and embedded in Epon. Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.\n\nNucleotide sequence of genomic segment 1 Preliminary sizing of several recombinant plasmids that hybridized with segment 1 in Northern blots demonstrated that none of them could be a full-length clone. However a set of three clones, P20/31, Rl l/30, and P55/34, that spanned the entire sequence of the gene 1 was identified and used to determined the nu- .I   12 24 36  I  12 24 3648  60 72 12  II  24 36 4860  72  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I   (9)  wt   pVL941/RFI  .I   36 48 60 72 36 48 60 72  I  I  I  I  I  I  I FIG. 4. Expression VP1 in recombinant baculoviruses. Spodoptera frugiperda cells were infected with recombinant viruses containing the VP1 gene and derived either from pAC461 or pVL941 transfer vectors. Cells were also infected with wild-type AcNPV (Wt). Proteins were labeled at indicated times (in hours) postinfection for 2 hr with [%]methionine and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was eitherfluorographed (A) or stained with Coomassie blue(B) to demonstrate the accumulation of the expressed proteins. Polyhedrin and rotavirus VP1 are indicated by arrows, respectively, at the left and at the right side of each panel.\n\ncleotide sequence (Fig. 2) . The complete nucleotide sequence of the plus strand of segment 1 and the protein it predicts are shown in Fig. 3 . Genome segment 1 is 3302 nucleotides long. The 5'-end (5'-GGCUAUU-AAA) and the 3'-end (AUGUGACC-3') of the gene contain the sequences which are conserved at the ends of all of the rotavirus segments that have been sequenced at this time. The absence of adenine-rich strings of nucleotides at the 3'noncoding region is consistent with the lack of polyadenylation of rotavirus mRNA. A 5' noncoding sequence of 18 bp precedes the first AUG codon which initiates an open reading frame of 1088 codons. Reading in any other frame of the coding or on the complementary strand yields numerous stop codons and short open reading frames. No direct evidence is available for the site of translation initiation but the first in-frame AUG is a strong initiation site according to the criteria of Kozak (1984) .\n\nThe calculated molecular weight of the deduced protein (124,847) corresponds precisely to the apparent molecular as estimated by electrophoresis. There is a preponderance of basic residues (129 Lys + Arg, 15 His) over acidic residues (126 Glu + Asp) indicating a positively charged protein at neutral pH.\n\nExpression of VP1 in S. frugiperda ceils Three baculovirus recombinants containing rotavirus gene 1 in position -7 respective to the initiation codon of the polyhedrin (pAC461/RFl. 1 to pAC461/ RF1.3) and three recombinants containing the rotavirus gene in position +34 (pVL941/RFl .l to pVL941/RF1.3) were initially identified and tested for their ability to produce rotavirus VP1 after infection of S. frugiperda cells. All three recombinants derived from the transfer vector pAC461 expressed equal amounts of VP1 The same observation was obtained with recombinant derived from pVL941. Consequently only pAC461/RFl .l and pVL941/RFl. 1 were used for the subsequent studies. VP1 synthesis in Sf9 cells infected with these two recombinant viruses was compared with that of the proteins of wild-type baculovirus (Fig. 4A) . The polyhedrin was absent in recombinant virus-infected cells, and a new band of the expected molecular weight (125,000) was easily identified at 24 hr postinfection. This band migrated the same as the in vitro translation product of gene 1 mRNA (data not shown). The kinetics of VP1 expression obtained with each of the recombinant viruses were similar with a peak of synthesis between 36 and 48 hr followed by a gradual decline until 72 hr postinfection. The level of VP1 synthesis by pVL941derived recombinant was 5 to 10 times greater than from viruses derived from pAC461. Analysis of the stained gels infected with pVL941/RFl .l recombinant indicated that rotavirus VP1 represent about 10% of the cell proteins and 20% of the amount of the polyhedrin found in Sf9 cells infected with wild-type virus (Fig.  4B) . Comparison of the amount of pulse-labeled protein with the total amount of protein in stained gels showed that of VP1 in Sf9 ceils was not degraded as the intensity of the 125K band constantly increased until 3 days postinfection whereas the rate of synthesis decreased after 48 hr. lmmunoreactivity and localization of recombinant VP1\n\nThe 125,000 molecularweight protein was identified as authentic VP1 by immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antiserum prepared to cesium chloride gradientpurified bovine rotavirus (Fig. 5) . The reaction was specific as the preimmune serum did not react with the Sf9 lysate. An antiserum to gene 1 recombinant-infected Sf9 cells was shown to recognize VP1 in rotavirus-infected Ma1 04 cell lysate by immunoprecipitation or Western blot. VP1 was not excreted into the supernatant of recombinant virus-infected cells and only 10% of the protein was soluble in RIPA buffer (data not shown). This fairly low percentage led us to examine by electron microscopy S. frugiperda cells infected with pVL941/RFl.l recombinant baculovirus in comparison with wild-type AcNPV-infected cells and uninfected cells. Examination of thin sections at various times postinfection failed to detect specific inclusions in recombinant virus infected cells. However, a significant increase of the electron-dense \"spacers\" which are found at the border of the fibrous structures formed by the baculovirus protein PlO were seen in these cells (Van der Wilk eta/., 1987) . The anti-VP1 antiserum also did not possess neutralization activity.\n\nComparison of nucleotide sequences of gene 1 with other published rotavirus genes revealed several short homologous region of statistical significance (data not shown). The deduced amino acid sequence predicts that VP1 is a basic protein with a net positive charge of 10.5 at pH 7.0, assuming glutamic and aspartic acids are each -1 and arginine, lysine, and histidine are fl, +l, and +0.5, respectively at neutral pH. In three places there is an accumulation of basic residues (87-96; 159-l 66; 451-460), similar to short stretches of basic residues found in histones. The deduced amino acid of VP1 was also analyzed to determine predicted hydropholic and hydrophobic domains. Although the N-terminal region is hydrophobic and the first 18 amino acids could correspond to a signal peptide (polar residue at position 3 and 9 hydrophobic residues in the 18 first residues) according to Perlman and Halvorson (1983) . However, these predictions are not supported by evaluation of the translocation of rotavirus proteins made in cell-free systems in the presence of microsomal membranes (Ericson et al., 1983) . Although there are nine potential N-type carbohydrate attachment sites there is also no direct evidence that this gene product is glycosylated. The deduced amino acid sequence yields limited information on the secondary structure of the protein. Using the rules proposed by Garnier et al. (1978) most of the a-helical regions were found to be confined to the amino-terminal half of the molecule. An examination of the carboxy-terminal region revealed the presence of 8 Ser-Lys or Lys-Ser di-amino acids which have been described as favored phosphorylation sites.\n\nComputer analysis was performed to attempt to identify possible functions of VP1 based on homologies with other proteins. Searches for similarities with other sequences of the NBRF and Genbank databases were performed using several algorithms (Lipman and Pearson, 1985; Kanehisha, 1982) . One region, between amino acids 517 and 636, presents a statistically significant homology with consensus sequences that have been established for a number of conserved regions in putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) from several RNA viruses of eukaryotes by comparison to the known poliovirus polymerase (Pietras et al., 1988). The amino acid sequence Gly-Asp-Asp (GDD) is present in this region. This sequence is thought to be characteristic of RdRp (Kamer and Argos, 1984) . Moreover two regions upstream of the GDD sequence bear a close resemblance to the published alignment (Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1988) . The matches present in these three elements are shown in Fig. 6 . A fourth consensus sequence usually found 30-50 residues downstream of the thrid element is not present in the VP1 sequence. It should be noted that similar sequences have been found in infectious bursal disease virus whose genome consists also of doublestranded RNA (Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1988; Dobos et al., 1979) .\n\nIn this study, the construction of two different recombinant viruses indicates that the new vector pVL941 is more efficient than pAC461 for the production of a nonfused protein under the polyhedrin promotor. This result confirms that the level of expression of a foreign gene that replaces the AcNPV polyhedrin gene is related to the preservation of the flanking sequences, upstream and downstream, of the initiating AUG translation codon of the polyhedrin gene (Luckow and Summers, 1988a,b; Matsura et al., 1987) . However, it should be noted that another rotavirus gene (segment 6) has been expressed to high level, relative to the level of expression of the polyhedrin, using the transfer vector pAC461 (Estes et al., 1987) .\n\nUp to now there is no known function for VP1 The fact that VP1 is an internal protein present in low amount had suggested that it could have an enzymatic (transcriptase or replicase) activity. The sequence data presented here favor this hypothesis and the production of viral proteins in high yield from the baculovirus system offers a new way to analyze the enzymatic role of VP1 by using the monospecific anti-VP1 antiserum either to inhibit transcriptase activity or to test the poly-merase activity of the recombinant protein. Experiments to test these hypotheses are in progress."}
