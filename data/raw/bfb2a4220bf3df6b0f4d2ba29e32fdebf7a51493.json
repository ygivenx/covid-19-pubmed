Currently there is no effective vaccine or treatment. against Ebola infection in human.\n\nin length, and encodes seven genes: NP, VP35, VP40, GP, VP30, VP24, and L (30) . The GP gene encodes two products through transcriptional editing (31, 36) .\n\nThe non-edited ORF encodes a smaller, secreted glycoprotein (sGP) which can be detected in large amount in the serum of the early phase of infected patients (31, 36) . However the role of sGP in viral replication and pathogenesis is still not clear. The -1 ORF of the GP gene encodes a membrane-anchored glycoprotein (GP) which is the sole structural protein that forms the spikes on the virion surface (32) .\n\nGP is synthesized as the pre-GP in the ER, fully glycosylated in Golgi (GP0), and transported to the plasma membrane where virus budding occurs (13, 25, 32) . GP0 is cleaved in the Golgi apparatus by furin-like proteases to generate two subunits, GP1 and GP2, which are linked by a disulfide bond (17, 24, 25) .\n\nThe native form of GP is a homotrimer of GP1/GP2 heterodimer on virions (32) . GP1 is highly glycosylated containing both N-and O-linked carbohydrates, especially in the mucin-like region (13) . GP1 is believed to be responsible for receptor binding, while GP2 for mediating membrane fusion and viral entry during Ebola infection. An X-ray structure of GP1/GP2 complex, believed to be at the native conformation, was recently reported. Together with the biochemical and extensive functional analysis of GP1, the receptorbinding domain (RBD) and some critical residues in RBD have been elucidated (4, 15, 16, 20, 21, 23) .\n\nIn contrast, characterization of the Ebola GP2 subunit has been limited in scope. Nevertheless, the available information reveals that the Ebola GP2 subunit shares several characteristic features with other viruses. It was proposed that GP2 is structurally similar to the transmembrane subunits (TM) of retroviruses, particularly that of Rous sarcoma viruses (11, 37) . The putative fusion peptide is located near the N-terminus. Following the putative fusion peptide is a region of heptad repeats (N-helical region) which are implicated in formation of coiled-coil structures.\n\nAnother predicted amphiphathic helical region (C-helical region) is located to the C-terminal end of the GP2 ectodomain. The X-ray structures of the core GP2 ectodomain show that the core GP2 ectodomain forms a trimer in which a long central three-stranded coiledcoil is surrounded by shorter C-terminal helices that are packed in an antiparallel orientation into hydrophobic grooves formed by the inner coiled-coil (19, 39) . This structural feature is shared by several viral fusion proteins such as HA2 of influenza virus, gp41 of human immunodeficiency virus, suggesting a common membrane fusion mechanism mediated by different viral glycoproteins. These proteins have been classified as the class I fusion proteins (8) . Mutational analysis of the hydrophobic residues in the N-and Chelices of GP2 indicated that some of these residues are indeed important in mediating Ebola entry (34), consistent with the structural features of the core GP2 ectodomain.\n\nIn this study, we examined the role of the charged residues in the GP2 helical regions in Ebola entry using a HIV pseudotyping system as a surrogate functional assay. We found that substitution of many charged residues in these regions greatly impaired the ability of Ebola GP to mediate efficient viral entry, indicating that these charged residues play an important role in viral entry. Elucidating the role(s) of these residues in protein folding and function of GP may provide insightful information on the molecular mechanism of Ebola entry and on the development of potential entry inhibitors against Ebola infection.\n\nDulbecco's modified Eagles Medium supplemented with 10% fatal calf serum with penicillin and streptomycin. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in the same medium plus 300 \u03bcg/mL Geneticin. A mouse monoclonal antibody, 12B5-1-1 (12) , which recognizes the GP1 of Ebola Zaire GP (EBOZ) was obtained from Dr. Mary Kay Hart. The HIV anti-p24 monoclonal antibody was obtained from NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program.\n\nAn anti-myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody was purchased from BAbCO. \n\nThe synthesized EBOZ-GP gene was cloned into pcDNA3.1(+), a mammalian expression vector, after KpnI and BamH I digestion, and named pEBOZ-GP.\n\nTo examine GP expression, 10\u03bcg of the pEBOZ-GP DNA was transfected into 293T cells in 100-mm plates by a modified calcium phosphate protocol as previously described (26) . Forty-eight hours post transfection, the cells were lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50mmol/L Tris-HCl pH7.5,150mmol/L NaCl, 5mmol/L EDTA,1% Triton X-100 plus protease inhibitors cocktail: leupeptin 10\u03bcg/mL, aprotinin \n\nAll GP2 mutants used in this study were generated by site-directed mutagenesis with pEBOZ-GP as the template, using Stratagene's Quick-Change Mutagenesis kit. All of the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (University of Chicago CRC DNA Sequencing Facility).\n\nPseudotyped virion stocks were generated by co-123 tansfecting DNAs of pEBOZ-GP or GP2 mutant with the HIV vector (pNL4-3-Luc-R--E-), into 293T cells (1, 9) . Briefly, 2\u03bcg of DNAs of pEBOZ-GP or GP2 mutants and 2\u03bcg DNA of HIV vector (pNL4-3-Luc-R--E-) was co-tranfected into 1\u00d7106 293T cells in six-well 1998 #348}. We found that the HIV-based system is more efficient than the MLV-based system for Ebola pseudotyping, since the MLV-based system with EBOZ GP gave a much lower signal over the background (data not shown) than the HIV-based system in our hands. Thus, we routinely use HIV-based pseudotyping system for Ebola pseudotyping.\n\nTo produce HIV/GP pseudotyped virions, 293T cells Fig. 2A, lane 3) . In addition, the myc-tagged GP2 subunit with a molecular weight of approximately 26 kDa was detected in the virion pellet, using anti-myc MAb 9E10 (Fig. 2A, lane 4) .\n\nThe HIV capsid protein p24 was detected by Western blotting using an anti-p24 MAb (data not shown).\n\nTherefore, we demonstrated that GP can be efficiently To examine the roles of the charged residues in the Ebola GP2 helical regions, we performed an alaninescanning analysis of the charged residues within the N-helix, the linker, and C-helix of EBOZ GP2. All together, 21 substitution mutants were generated, including 8 in the N-helix, 6 in the linker, and 7 in the C-helix (Fig.3B) . Each of the substitution mutants was examined for protein expression in 293T cells, incorporation into HIV viral particles, and the ability to mediate viral entry by luciferase assay.\n\nIt was found that all 21 mutants were expressed in a level comparable to that of wild type EBOZ-GP in 293T cells (Fig. 4A, top panel) . Furthermore, all of the mutant GP proteins except D614A (lane 16 in Fig. 4A , middle panel) were able to be efficiently incorporated into HIV particles (Fig. 4A, middle panel) . These results suggest that substitutions of these charged residues do not have a detectably adverse effect on GP protein expression, processing, and protein folding.\n\nIn these experiments, the HIV p24 levels were used as an estimate for quantifying HIV virions in the supernatants. Figure 4A The X-ray structure of Ebola GP2 indicates that the \u03b2-COOH group of D614 is proximal to the guanidino group of R580 (4.14\u00c5), suggesting that these residues may interact via an intra-molecular salt bridge (19, 39) .\n\nIn an attempt to examine this possibility, two point Although the X-ray structure of the GP2 core does not reveal direct ionic interactions between them, an intriguing possibility is that some of these residues are involved in forming ionic bonds with the residues of the opposite charges of GP2 in the intermediate conformations of GP protein in Ebola entry. This hypothesis was tested using nine GP double mutants all of which contain substitution of R587 by an aspartate, and each also contains a \"compensatory\" second site substitution by an arginine of the negatively charged residues within the GP2 helical region, respectively. As shown in Figure 6A , none of these double mutants was defective in GP expression, nor in viral incorporation, suggesting that these substitutions did not greatly disrupt the native conformation of GP.\n\nNevertheless, none of these mutants was able to confer a detectable level of the GP-mediated viral entry (Fig. 6B) , indicating that R587D could not be \"compensated\" by any second site substitutions of the negatively charged residues in the helical regions.\n\nOne important finding of the current study is that many charged residues in the GP2 helical regions are critical in mediating efficient Ebola entry. We have shown that substitution of these charged residues by alanine scanning did not appear to adversely affect GP fusion-inactive state to the stable, fusion-active state upon low pH treatment (5, 7, 40) . Although the native structure of the GP2 has not been reported yet, the reported GP2 core structure is shown to be a trimeric coiled-coil formed by the N-terminal helices surrounded by a shorter C-terminal helices in an antiparallel orientation (19, 39) , which is highly similar to that of the influenza virus HA2 and the HIV gp41.\n\nSince it appears that the Ebola entry, like that of influenza virus, is low pH-dependent (27, 35) Curiously, functional analysis of the charged residues in the helical regions in membrane fusion and viral entry, to our knowledge, has not been systemically carried out in any class I fusion protein. One possible reason for the lack of effort or interest is that the six helical bundle structures, for example, the core GP2 structure of Ebola, do not give clues regarding the role(s) of the most charged residues. We reasoned that these residues of Ebola GP2 might play important roles in protein folding and function in membrane fusion and viral entry. Indeed, most of the substitution mutants of the charged residues in the regions greatly impaired the ability of GP to mediate Ebola entry, even though these mutations did not appear to grossly affect expression, processing, and incorporation into viral particles (Fig.4) . Therefore, the current study and that a C-terminal peptide of GP2 was not as effective as that of gp41 in inhibiting membrane fusion and viral entry (34) . In addition, the C-helical region of GP2 is much smaller than that of HIV gp41.\n\nSequence alignment of the N-1 and C-1 helical regions did not indicate many conserved charged residues among the F proteins from paramyxoviruses (28) . Thus, further investigation for diversity of fusion mechanisms utilized by various class I fusion proteins is needed to elucidate the mechanistic specificity for each fusion protein.\n\nThe exact role(s) of the charged residues in the helical regions of Ebola GP2 in protein folding is not known yet. Further studies by an integral approach of molecular, biochemical, and structural analyses on GP are required to reveal how these charged residues are involved in maintaining the correct conformation(s) in the different steps during membrane fusion and Ebola entry. It is still possible that some of these residues play a role in maintaining the native conformation of GP such as stabilizing the trimeric state of GP, or interacting with GP1 which is highly unlikely based on the results in this report. However, we favor a hypothesis that these residues, at least some of them, "}
