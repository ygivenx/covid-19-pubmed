[2] [3] [4] [5] Occasionally, this symptom is a clue to diagnosis of a treatable bacterial infection or underlying condition.\n\nAcute, sporadic mucopurulent rhinorrhea has an infectious cause and almost always is the manifestation of the uncomplicated \"common cold\" due to rhinovirus, coronavirus, or other circulating viruses. 6 When the problem is chronic or recurrent, or persistent and unilateral, broader underlying anatomic, obstructive, immunologic, and allergic disorders are considered (Table  21 -1). [7] [8] [9] [10] Onset in an infant younger than 3 months heightens suspicion of anatomic anomaly, ciliary dyskinesia, or cystic fibrosis. Accompanying sinusitis, otitis media, or pneumonia raises consideration of an immunologic deficiency (especially immunoglobulin deficiency or dysfunction, as in hypogammaglobulinemia or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection), neutrophil defect, cystic fibrosis, or ciliary dyskinesia. URIs are conspicuously severe in such instances, with recrudescence almost immediately after discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. Unilateral nasal discharge and obstruction should prompt investigation for a foreign body, mass lesion, or unilateral posterior choanal atresia. Table 21 -2 shows differentiating features of important or common causes of acute mucopurulent rhinorrhea; allergic rhinitis is included because it is frequently part of the differential diagnosis in older children and adolescents.\n\nIn uncomplicated viral nasopharyngitis or rhinitis, nasal discharge is initially clear but can become white, yellow, or green (related to mucous secretions, dryness, blood, exfoliation of damaged epithelial cells and cilia, and leukocytic inflammatory response). Presence of high fever and persistence of discharge depend on the specific viral cause but are more common in uncomplicated infection than generally perceived.\n\nIn a study of hospitalized children, more than 50% of those with uncomplicated adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, or respiratory syncytial virus infection had temperatures >39\u00b0C, and 12% had temperatures >40\u00b0C; height of fever in these children was not different from that in children with serious bacterial infection. 11 Fever persisted for 5 days or longer in 37% of the children in the study; 20% to 30% of those with adenovirus or influenza A infection had fever for 7 days or longer. In another study, nasal discharge or congestion associated with uncomplicated URI persisted for 6.6 days in 1-to 2-year-old children who were in home care and for 8.9 days in children younger than 1 year in out-ofhome childcare centers. 1 In this study, 13% of 2-to 3-year-old children in out-of-home childcare had symptoms for more than 15 days.\n\nThe bacteriology of nasopharyngeal flora in children with uncomplicated viral respiratory illnesses, mucopurulent rhinorrhea, acute otitis media, and sinusitis has been evaluated and compared with that in normal children. 6, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Viral infection is associated with acquisition of new serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae and with temporally increased risk of acute otitis media. 21 Quantitative, and some qualitative, differences in nasopharyngeal flora have been found in children with purulent nasopharyngitis (and uncomplicated viral upper respiratory illnesses), with excessive isolation rates reported for S. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, 13, 18 Peptostreptococcus spp., Fusobacterium spp., and Prevotella melaninogenica. 18, 19 The significance of such findings is unclear; isolation of such organisms may reflect exuberant proliferation in virus-induced inflammatory mucus or acquisition of a more robust specimen than is collected in healthy subjects. Furthermore, \"high\" rates of isolation of S. pneumoniae in 25% to 46% of subjects do not exceed those in healthy young children when fastidious technique is used. 22 Only two systematically performed studies on the course of mucopurulent rhinorrhea have been published. In one study, prospective evaluation showed that there was no difference in duration of illness or complications in children with clear or purulent nasal discharge. 14 In a placebo-controlled, blinded study of 142 children 3 months to 3 years old with mucopurulent rhinorrhea of any duration, antibiotic therapy (cephalexin), systemic use of an antihistamine-decongestant, or both had no effect on the course or complications of mucopurulent rhinorrhea. 12 In a small pilot study of 13 children younger than 2 years whose purulent nasal discharge had persisted for at least 10 days without improvement, amoxicillin-clavulanate (40 mg/kg per day divided into 3 doses for 10 days) was significantly associated with resolution of symptoms in comparison with placebo. 15 Response to antimicrobial therapy does not necessarily validate an entity of bacterial nasopharyngitis, however; it seems more likely that some children with such responses have an incomplete symptom complex of ethmoid sinusitis. Acute bacterial adenoiditis is postulated to be another cause of purulent nasal discharge when: (1) tympanic membranes are normal; (2) S. pyogenes is not found in culture specimens; and (3) radiographs show an enlarged adenoid shadow but no sinus abnormality. 23, 24 Critical study has not been performed to validate this entity.\n\nMucopurulent rhinorrhea or daytime cough (which frequently is worse at night), or both of 10 or more days' duration without improvement (or recrudescence after improvement or new onset of fever) is highly suggestive of paranasal bacterial sinusitis and responsive to antibiotic therapy. 17, 25, 26 Sinus radiographs show significant abnormalities in nearly 90% of children 2 to 6 years old with uncomplicated upper respiratory tract illness (see Chapter 32, Sinusitis), and thus are nonspecific in this age group, supporting a clinical approach to diagnosis without imaging.\n\nIn children younger than 3 years, S. pyogenes has been associated with high fever, toxicity, and clear rhinorrhea or indolent infection with irregular fever and purulent nasal discharge, sometimes with associated excoriation of nares or tender anterior cervical lymphadenitis. 13, 18, 25 In a streptococcal outbreak studied in a childcare facility for school-aged and young children, 26% of children younger than 3 years were affected, but pharyngitis was predominant, with no case of nasal streptococcosis. 27 \n\nBacterial nasopharyngitis associated with nasal foreign body is typified by the young age of the patient and putrid, commonly bloodstained, unilateral nasal discharge. Fever is unusual unless infection has spread to contiguous sinuses or distant sites. Prevotella, Fusobacterium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. as well as facultative flora are responsible. Nasal discharge can be the first manifestation of congenital syphilis and a later finding in nasal diphtheria, in which discharge is putrid and sanguineous and contains pieces of pseudomembrane.\n\nAllergic rhinitis typically begins in the second decade of life, is uncommon before age 3 years, and incidence appears to be increasing in children between these ages. Diagnosis can be suspected because of the season, environmental precipitants, personal and family history of allergy, other associated symptoms and physical findings, and the response to specific interventions of avoidance or pharmacotherapy (see Table 21 -2). Nasal secretions usually are clear or whitish. Diagnostic usefulness of nasal cytologic analysis is controversial; 10,28 relative eosinophilia (above 20%) is suggestive but not diagnostic of allergic rhinitis.\n\nIn the vast majority of children with purulent nasal discharge (even if thick and green) of up to 1 week in duration, history and setting of illness, associated symptoms, and physical findings suggest uncomplicated viral URI. Antimicrobial therapy is inappropriate unless acute otitis media or sinusitis is diagnosed from additional findings (see Chapter 32, Sinusitis). Symptomatic therapy with saline nose drops or lavage facilitates expulsion of secretions and provides humidification. Its effectiveness reduces parental pressure to prescribe an antibiotic. 29 If mucopurulent rhinorrhea persists for more than 5 days, and especially if some findings (e.g., anterior cervical lymphadenitis, scarlatiniform rash, excoriation around nostrils) or the epidemiology heightens the likelihood of group A streptococcal disease, nasopharyngeal specimens should be obtained for culture of S. pyogenes only. If culture is positive, penicillin V is given for 10 days. Routine culture for, or recovery of, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Staphylococcus aureus has no meaning and is an opportunity for misinterpretation.\n\nIf mucopurulent rhinorrhea persists for more than 10 days without diminution, and especially if other symptoms are present, paranasal sinusitis is likely. Nasal mucosa is examined after use of single or second (5 minutes after the first) application of a topical All references are available online at www.expertconsult.com vasoconstrictor such as oxymetazoline. 15 If purulent secretions flow from the middle meatus, the diagnosis of acute sinusitis is confirmed. Signs of allergic rhinitis also can be confirmed. Radiographs may be helpful in patients older than 6 years to confirm sinusitis (or possibly to suggest adenoiditis). Many clinicians would treat children who have purulent nasal discharge of greater than 10 days' duration as for acute sinusitis, usually with amoxicillin initially. When antimicrobial therapy is effective, substantial improvement of symptoms is expected within 48 to 72 hours. Therapy is continued for 1 week beyond complete resolution of respiratory symptoms.\n\nStridor is a rough, crowing sound caused by passage of air through a narrowed upper airway, which includes the extrathoracic trachea, larynx, and hypopharynx. Because the extrathoracic airway normally narrows during the inspiratory phase of respiration, stridor due to upper-airway disease occurs during inspiration (or is more pronounced during inspiration if severe narrowing causes obstruction during inspiration and expiration). Because the intrathoracic trachea normally narrows during expiration, obstruction of the intrathoracic trachea, such as that due to extrinsic compression of vascular ring or intraluminal obstruction of foreign body, inflammation, or tracheomalacia, causes a loud noise, acoustically like stridor, heard during both phases of respiration but is more pronounced on expiration. Extrathoracic obstruction (inspiratory stridor) is associated with prolonged inspiration and underaeration of the chest, whereas intrathoracic obstruction (expiratory stridor or wheezing) is associated with prolonged expiration and overinflated chest. Stridor can be associated with mild tachypnea, but a respiratory rate >50 breaths/minute should not be ascribed to upper-airway obstruction alone.\n\nThe timbre of the stridulous sound provides a clue to etiology: for example, (1) the high-pitched, fixed, dry sound of congenital subglottic stenosis; (2) the wet, rhonchal changing sound of inflammatory laryngotracheitis; and (3) the low-pitched, vibratory, positionally variable sound of laryngomalacia. Associated voice changes are useful in specifying disease as well. Vocal cord paralysis causes a weak, dysphonic cry; supraglottic obstruction, a muffled voice; and laryngotracheitis, hoarseness or aphonia, frequently with a barking cough.\n\nCategorization of the setting and duration of stridor as acute, persistent, or recurrent or episodic provides a framework for considering likely causes (Table 21-3) . [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] Infectious agents cause most acute upper-airway obstruction, from intraluminal, epithelial inflammation or by encroachment on the airway by reactive or infected lymphoid tissue in parapharyngeal or paratracheal spaces. Fungal or viral tracheobronchitis must be considered when stridor occurs in an immunocompromised child; odynophagia and dysphagia also are present commonly. 31 Congenital anatomic abnormalities are considered, especially in infants whose persistent stridor began neonatally. Acquired obstruction can have abrupt onset and an obvious cause (such as foreign-body aspiration or necrotizing tracheobronchitis in ventilated neonates) or more insidious onset and inapparent cause (such as expanding laryngotracheal papillomas or hemangioma or an extrinsic compressing mass). The younger the infant, the more likely that sudden obstruction, apnea, or feeding difficulties overshadow a singular complaint of stridor.\n\nRecognition, care to avoid precipitating sudden airway occlusion, and urgent, expert intervention to establish an airway when indicated are paramount to avert disastrous outcomes of acute upperairway obstruction. Table 21 -4 shows characteristic features of infectious causes of stridor and acute airway obstruction. [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] Viral laryngotracheitis (infectious croup) or laryngotracheobronchitis due to parainfluenza viruses is by far the most common. 35, 36 Influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenoviruses, and other viruses typically cause symptomatic disease elsewhere in the respiratory tract, but during epidemic seasons, stridor is the predominant feature in a minority of infected children. Bacterial tracheitis is usually a complication of viral laryngotracheitis (with concordant peak age and season) but can occur at any age or as a complication of oropharyngeal surgery. 43 Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause, followed by Streptococcus pyogenes; the role of anaerobic bacteria is less clear. 41, 43 With the universal use of H. influenzae b vaccine, epiglottitis is a rare cause of stridor; current cases of supraglottitis are more likely to affect the aryepiglottic region and to be caused by streptococci. Parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal infections in young children must also be considered; their incidence is increasing 42, 44, 45 (see Chapter 28, Infections Related to the Upper and Middle Airways).\n\nThe history surrounding the onset of stridor and the patient's age and demeanor are the most helpful clues to the likely site and cause of infection. The child with viral laryngotracheitis usually has had 2 to 3 days of typical upper respiratory tract illness when cough worsens and stridor begins. The child with bacterial tracheitis usually has had a similar background illness and then has sudden high fever, toxicity, and rapid progression of airway obstruction. The young child with retropharyngeal abscess or adolescent with peritonsillar abscess has less stridor but refuses to swallow, has a muffled voice, and a guarded posture to maximize the oropharyngeal airway. Trismus is an expected and useful finding in patients with peritonsillar abscess as well as in some with lateral pharyngeal space infections of odontogenic origin. 38 Epiglottitis and supraglottitis cause the patient to guard anxiously in a sitting posture with arms back, jaw forward, and chin raised (\"sniffing dog\") to maximize \"lift\" of the epiglottis away from the airway. In contrast, subglottic, tracheal obstruction cannot be lessened by position; patients with laryngotracheitis or bacterial tracheitis thrash about with the anxiety of suffocation.\n\nThe expected course 36, 46, 47 and sequelae of acute infectious airway obstruction are shown in Table 21 -5. Children with viral laryngotracheitis are less prone to sudden complete obstruction; hourly course is predictable by degree of stridor and adequacy of aeration; response to racemic epinephrine and corticosteroid therapy usually averts intubation. Establishment of an artificial airway is urgently required for almost all patients with stridor due to acute supraglottic and bacterial tracheal infection, and for many with retropharyngeal infection. The course of disease in children with bacterial tracheitis can be further complicated, because infection (and obstructive consequences) commonly extends the length of the trachea and below.\n\nCough is a critical protective mechanism to expel particulate matter from the larynx and trachea as well as a cardinal sign of infectious and noninfectious respiratory tract and nonrespiratory tract disorders. Occasional acute life-threatening infectious and noninfectious causes may be overlooked unless the clinician adopts a disciplined approach. Careful assessment of a pathologic coughits onset, duration, clinical context, and association with other findings as well as its specific timbre, pattern, and productivity -frequently predicts the site of pathophysiology and narrows the differential diagnosis to a limited number of entities. Cough usually is defined as acute (<3 weeks), subacute (3-8 weeks), or chronic (>8 weeks). A \"wet\" or \"moist\" cough in children, frequently referred to as productive (although young children rarely expectorate), is associated with detectable secretions by bronchoscopy and can be reported accurately by parents and clinicians. 47 Etiology A dry cough is expected in allergic rhinitis/sinusitis or asthma while a wet cough is typical in infectious sinusitis, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and pneumonia. The vast majority of coughs are related to self-limited viral upper respiratory tract illness (URI), with up to 40% of school-aged children still coughing 10 days after onset of a common cold, and 10% of preschool-aged All references are available online at www.expertconsult.com children coughing 25 days after a URI. 48 Isolated subacute cough (in absence of other symptoms), which usually is dry and follows viral infection, frequently is related to increased cough receptor sensitivity. 49 Chronic cough is pathologic. Differential diagnosis also can be focused by age, history, and clinical findings; algorithm for sequential evaluation and management is specific and sometimes complex 50 -best performed by a pediatric pulmonologist. Most common causes of chronic cough evaluated in older (mean 8-9 years) U.S. 51 and Turkish 52 children were: allergic or nonallergic rhinitis and sinusitis, asthma, protracted bacterial bronchitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. An important minority of children have cystic fibrosis, non-CF bronchiectasis, or ciliary dyskinesia syndrome. The focus of management is etiology. No evidence supports the use of medications aimed at symptomatic relief of acute or chronic cough and some data suggest potential harmful effects. Cough should not be accepted as a sign of self-limited URI in infants younger than 3 months. The mnemonic CRADLE may be useful to call to mind important considerations for such patients: 53 C, cystic fibrosis; R, respiratory tract infections (especially pneumonia and pertussis); A, aspiration (swallowing dysfunction, gastroesophageal reflux, tracheoesophageal fistula); D, dyskinesia of cilia; L, lung, vascular, or airway malformations; E, edema (heart failure, pulmonary lymphangiectasia). Table 21 -6 provides a framework for consideration of cough illnesses. Comments on certain infections follow. There is considerable overlap in symptomatology of cough caused by certain infectious agents, such as Bordetella pertussis or Mycoplasma pneumoniae in adolescents, 54 because of a common tracheobronchial site of pathophysiology and frequent dual infection by microbes. 55 B. pertussis causes a dramatic, debilitating paroxysmal cough without airway or lower tract abnormalities (unless secondary pneumonia occurs, leading to fever and toxicity), whereas C. trachomatis causes pneumonia with prominent tachypnea: the cough is only important because it brings the child to medical attention (see Chapter 162, Bordetella pertussis (Pertussis) and\n\nOther Bordetella Species; Chapter 167, Chlamydia trachomatis). Diagnosis of pneumonia is based on signs of lower respiratory tract involvement, such as tachypnea and retractions, in addition to cough, and the likely causative agent is determined from the constellation of clinical findings (Tables 21-7 and 21-8) .\n\nProtracted bacterial bronchitis is inadequately studied but may be an underdiagnosed cause of chronic wet cough, or misdiagnosed as asthma. 56 Diagnosis rests on clinical bronchoscopy findings, i.e., presence of dense bacteria and neutrophilic acute inflammatory response, 57 normal imaging of the chest, and response to antimicrobial therapy. Commonly implicated organisms are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. In attempts to avoid bronchoscopy, some pulmonologists prescribe a trial of amoxicillin-clavulanate (14:1 formulation) for 2 weeks in patients with typical isolated episode of chronic cough.\n\nTachypnea can be a voluntary or involuntary response to anxiety, fright, or pain; an abnormal breathing pattern related to central nervous system dysfunction; or the physiologic response to increased temperature or metabolic state. It is most usually the response to respiratory acidosis or hypoxemia of acute infection or the attempt to restore pH balance during metabolic acidosis (e.g., diabetes, salicylate poisoning, dehydration). Metabolic causes should not be forgotten, while the clinician pursues the All references are available online at www.expertconsult.com foreign body or anomaly, produces homophonous, monotonous wheeze. The rate of radiographically confirmed pneumonia among children with wheezing is low, <5% overall, and 2% in the absence of fever. 65 Rhonchi, sometimes also termed low-pitched wheezes, or coarse crackles, are nonrepetitive, nonmusical, lowpitched sounds frequently present on early inspiration and expiration; they are usually a sign of turbulent airflow through secretions in large airways. Fine crackles (the term preferred by pulmonologists for rales, which has a variety of meanings across languages) are high-pitched, low-amplitude, end-inspiratory, discontinuous popping sounds indicative of the opening of peripheral airfluid interfaces. Fine crackle is the auscultatory finding suggestive of the diagnosis of pneumonia. Auscultatory abnormalities of crackles and wheezing have disparate diagnostic usefulness among various studies, depending on the categorization of bronchiolitis. Tachypnea is a more sensitive finding than crackles for bacterial pneumonia; wheezing is more sensitive than tachypnea for bronchiolitis.\n\nDiminished or distant breath sounds, dullness to percussion, and decreased vocal fremitus indicate peripheral pulmonary consolidation, pleural mass, or fluid collection. Tubular breath sounds (low-pitched sound of similar intensity throughout inspiration and expiration, as normally heard in the intrascapular area), dullness to percussion, and increased vocal fremitus indicate parenchymal consolidation, atelectasis, or the presence of another continuous tissue or fluid density abutting both a bronchus and the chest wall.\n\nRadiographic infiltrates have been reported in 5% to 19% of children with fever in the absence of symptoms or signs of lower respiratory tract infection. 69, 70 Rate of pneumonia deemed as occult fell from 15% to 9% after universal vaccination with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in one study. 70 Clinical features associated with occult pneumonia in another study included presence of cough, fever greater than 5 days' duration, high fever (>39\u00b0C) and leukocytosis >20,000 cells/mm 3 ; only 5% of children without cough had radiographically confirmed pneumonia. 69\n\nIn young infants, acute infection with bacterial and nonbacterial respiratory tract pathogens frequently leads to lower respiratory tract infection. Except in the first few days of life, when pneumonia is due predominantly to bacteria acquired from the mother's genital tract or to organisms acquired transplacentally, nonbacterial pathogens are overwhelmingly predominant. 68 As perinatally acquired agents persist, community exposures increase, and maternally derived antibody protection wanes, the infant between 3 weeks and 3 months old is vulnerable to a unique array of lower respiratory tract pathogens. 71 Clinical setting, specific symptom complex, and severity of illness in proportion to findings on physical examination aid distinction of likely causes and guide the diagnostic and therapeutic approach (see Table 21 -8) . Although the pathogens listed in Table 21 -8 frequently are referred to as causing \"afebrile pneumonia,\" this is a misnomer, because Bordetella pertussis infrequently causes lower respiratory tract abnormalities, and respiratory syncytial virus and especially other respiratory viruses frequently cause fever. 11, 68, 72, 73 A causal role for Ureaplasma urealyticum is not completely defined, because the situation is confounded by the asymptomatic presence of this organism in women and young infants. Pneumonia due to Pneumocystis jirovecii probably is confined to infants with severe debilitation or immune defects.\n\nPneumonia in Older Infants, Children, and Adolescents Table 21 -9 categorizes the features of acute pneumonia in older infants, children, and adolescents by etiology. No single fact much more likely primary pulmonary causes. Additionally, tachypnea can result from primary cardiac abnormalities (congestive heart failure, cyanotic congenital heart disease), pulmonary vascular abnormalities (cardiac shunts, capillary dilatation, hemorrhage, obstructed return to the heart, or infarction), impaired lymphatic flow (congenital lymphangiectasia, tumor), or pleural fluid collections (hemorrhagic, purulent, transudative, or lymphatic fluid or a misplaced infusion from a vascular catheter).\n\nClinical practice guidelines for management of communityassociated pneumonia in infants and children have been published from the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America, and include excellent literature review of clinical findings. 58 Table 21 -7 shows symptoms and signs of pneumonia in infants and children. Tachypnea is thought to be the best clinical predictor of lower respiratory tract infection in children. The World Health Organization defines pneumonia primarily as cough or difficult breathing and tachypnea, which definition is age-related: respiratory rate (RR) in breaths/minute >60 in infants 0-2 months of age, >50 in infants 2 to 12 months, >40 in children 1 to 5 years, and >20 in children >5 years of age. 59 Tachypnea has sensitivity of 50% to 85% for diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infection with specificity of 70% to 97%. 60, 61 The younger the patient under 24 months of age, the less likely that pneumonia is present if tachypnea is absent. In one study, for infants younger than 2 months, respiratory rate of 60 breaths/minute, retractions, or nasal flaring had sensitivity for diagnosis of pneumonia of 91%. 61 Tachypnea also can be a response to fever, dehydration, or metabolic acidosis. In a study from a U.S. emergency department of children younger than 5 years of age who were undergoing chest radiography for possible pneumonia, respiratory rates in those with and without documented pneumonia did not differ significantly. However, 20% of those with WHO-defined tachypnea had pneumonia confirmed compared with 12% in those who did not. 62 Performance of a chest radiograph in febrile infants without an apparent focus of infection to exclude pneumonia \"missed\" by physical examination has low yield in the absence of tachypnea. 63, 64 Cough is a more sensitive but nonspecific symptom of pneumonia. Other symptoms and signs associated with pneumonia, such as nasal flaring, intercostal retractions, and cyanosis, have less sensitivity (25%, 9%, and 9%, respectively) but high specificity (87%, 93%, and 94%, respectively). 60 Although fever, cough, and tachypnea are cardinal features, any or all of them can be overshadowed or overlooked in patients who come to medical attention for pneumonia-associated stiff neck, abdominal pain, or chest pain or for nonspecific symptoms of illness, such as feeding difficulty in infants. While chest radiograph is not necessary routinely in children with any of these complaints, it should be considered if the patient has fever and cough or tachypnea. 65, 66 Classic symptoms of pneumonia reported in adolescents and adults are fever, chills, pleuritic chest pain, and cough productive of purulent sputum, with less noticeable tachypnea. 67 Grunting is an expiratory sound produced in the larynx when vocal cords are adducted to generate positive end-expiratory pressure (self-induced PEEP) and increased resting volume of the lung. Its causes are myriad but never trivial. Grunting can be a sign of surfactant deficiency in the neonate, or of pulmonary edema, foreign-body aspiration, severe pneumonia, mediastinal mass or severe mediastinal shift from any cause, pleuritic or musculoskeletal chest pain, or myopericarditis or other cardiac abnormalities at any age. 68 Retractions (intercostal, subcostal, or suprasternal) and grunting have been associated with severe pneumonia; and nasal flaring and head bobbing with hypoxemia.\n\nAdventitial respiratory sounds usually indicate lower respiratory tract disease, pulmonary edema, or hemorrhage. Wheezes are musical continuous sounds present predominantly on expiration and are a sign of airway obstruction. Widespread bronchiolar narrowing, as most commonly occurs with the inflammation of virusassociated lower respiratory tract infection, produces heterophonous high-pitched, sibilant wheezes of variable pitch and presence in different lung fields. Fixed obstruction in a larger airway, as from in history or finding on examination is unique for any agent, but when they are taken together, a working diagnosis emerges and guides intervention or further diagnostic testing. Chest radiography and laboratory tests usually are reserved for patients who are ill and hospitalized or whose clinical picture is not compelling for a category of etiologic agents. A number of studies using complex diagnostic methodologies have confirmed the specific cause of pneumonia in 45% to 85% of cases. 72-76 Viral etiologies predominate, and, currently, most are amenable to diagnosis. 72 The efficacy trial and postmarketing studies of PCV7 infers Streptococcus pneumoniae as a relatively common cause of pneumonia with patchy or consolidative infiltrates. 77, 78 Urine antigen detection test in children with lobar pneumonia also supports the important role of S. pneumoniae; 79 however, the test is positive in >15% of children with asymptomatic colonization. 80 Testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae using IgM enzyme immunoassay serologic test is problematic because of false-positive tests, and may be best utilized in school-aged children and adolescents with findings consistent with mycoplasma infection in those whose pretest probability is moderate or higher. 58, 81 Currently, ascribing a causal role of pneumonia to Chlamydophila pneumoniae is confounded by the findings of prolonged asymptomatic carriage and inconsistent serologic results among studies. 82\n\nHemoptysis, defined as coughing up of blood that originated below the larynx, is uncommon in children; most commonly, supposed episodes are due to a posteriorly draining nosebleed. Mechanisms of hemoptysis include bleeding from: (1) congenital or acquired abnormal bronchial or pulmonary blood flow, venous obstruction, or vascular abnormalities; (2) immune-mediated endothelial damage; or (3) infectious or traumatic erosion of tracheal, bronchial, or bronchiolar epithelium. Hemorrhage can be mild (tracheitis, tracheobronchitis) or massive (congenital malformations, foreign body, bronchiectasis, pulmonary hemosiderosis). Causes of hemoptysis in children are listed in Table 21 -10. Infection is the most common cause of mild hemoptysis. Panton-Valentine leukocidin-producing Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia is specifically associated with hemoptysis. 83 Epstein-Barr virus was implicated in a single case. 84 For more severe hemoptysis, bronchiectasis associated with cystic fibrosis accounts for as many cases as all other causes combined. 85 Rigid bronchoscopy, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging are useful diagnostic modalities in most cases of hemoptysis. Digital subtraction angiography and, occasionally, cardiac catheterization or arteriography are required."}
