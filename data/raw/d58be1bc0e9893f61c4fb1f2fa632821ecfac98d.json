{"title": "", "body": "A total of 195 complete and near-complete human ICV matrix segment sequences and 1 porcine ICV matrix segment sequence were obtained from GenBank (same as the sequences from Influenza Research Database). The analyses of 10 bovine and human ICV matrix gene sequences were carried out by using CLC Genomic Workbench version 9.0.1 (CLC bio, Boston, MA, USA) to generate a multiple sequence alignment. BioEdit version 7.2.5 (https://www.bioedit.com/) was used to generate a sequence identity table.\n\nWe constructed a phylogenetic tree with MEGA7 (3) using multiple alignments of the 10 bovine ICV matrix gene sequences generated in this study plus 195 complete and near-complete human ICV matrix gene sequences and 1 porcine ICV matrix gene sequence. The alignment length was trimmed to 559 bp. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the maximum likelihood method on the basis of the Jukes-Cantor model (4) with 1,000 bootstrap replicates (5) . Initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying the Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated by using the maximum composite likelihood approach and then selecting the topology with the superior log likelihood value."}
