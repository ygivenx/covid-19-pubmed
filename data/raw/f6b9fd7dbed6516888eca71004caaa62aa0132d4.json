{"title": "An exploratory randomized, controlled study on the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir or arbidol treating adult patients hospitalized with mild/moderate COVID-19 (ELACOI)", "body": "Since December, 2019, cases of the novel coronavirus disease have rapidly spread from Wuhan, China to throughout China and over 110 other countries and territories within just two months [1, 2] . This outbreak was confirmed to be caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV), belonging to the same family of viruses responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [3] . The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern. As of March 16 th , 2020, 167,515 confirmed cases and 6,606 death cases have been documented globally [2] .\n\nDespite the rapid spread worldwide, little is known about the pathogenesis of the virus or its infectious host. Even worse, no vaccine or specific antiviral drugs have demonstrated efficacy in prevention or treatment of COVID-19, which has resulted in great difficulty of controlling the epidemic and decrease mortality rate [4] .\n\nBased on \"Diagnosis and treatment of pneumonitis caused by new coronavirus (trial version 6) \" issued by the National Health Commission of China on February 19 th , 2020, several drugs including lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and arbidol were recommended for treatment of COVID-19 as the antiviral regimens [5] . Lopinavir is a human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor, usually combined with ritonavir for inhibiting cytochrome P450 in order 6 6 to increase the half-life of lopinavir [6] . In the past 10 years, LPV/r has been proven to have good efficacy and limited side effects for treating HIV-1 [7] .\n\nLopinavir was reported to have antiviral activity against MERS-CoV in Vero cells (concentration causing a 50% reduction in replication (EC50) = 8 \u00b5M) [8] .\n\nMeanwhile, the combination of LPV/r had been associated with significantly fewer adverse clinical outcomes (acute respiratory distress syndrome or death) in 41 patients with SARS compared with ribavirin alone in 111 historical controls (2.4% versus 28.8%, P= 0.001) within the 21 days after the onset of symptoms, despite lacking valid estimate of efficacy [9] . Based on in vitro testing and previous clinical trials demonstrating its efficacy against other coronaviruses, LPV/r was regarded as an option for treating COVID-19.\n\nArbidol is a haemagglutinin inhibitors that can effectively block the fusion of influenza virus with host cell. Meanwhile, it can also induce the body to produce endogenous interferon against virus replication, enhance the phagocytic function of macrophages, and activate natural killer cells. It can enhance the phagocytic function of macrophages and induce the activation of natural killer cells [10, 11] . Arbidol was reported efficacious against all kinds of influenza viruses (A, B, C), especially against influenza A viruses (H1N1, H2N2, H3N3) and safe with few side effects [12] . Arbidol was also shown to have some direct antiviral effect in reducing the reproduction of SARS virus in the cultured cells [13] . Interestingly, it was announced by Li Lanjuan's team that that arbidol could effectively inhibit coronavirus up to 60 times at a concentration of 10-30 \u00b5M compared with the untreated control [14] .\n\nLPV/r and arbidol were recommended for treating COVID-19 in China because of the above reasons and critically lack of preventive vaccines and efficient antiviral therapies presently. Nevertheless, we did not know the actual clinical efficacy of LPV/r or arbidol against SARS-CoV-2 thus far. Therefore, we were urgently in demand of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy or adverse outcomes of LPV/r or arbidol treating COVID-19.\n\nGuangzhou Eighth People's Hospital is a designated hospital for the treatment of COVID-19 patients and hospitalized over 80% of the patients confirmed with COVID-19 in Guangzhou. Here, we report an exploratory randomized and controlled study ELACOI at this hospital, aiming to provide preliminary evaluation of the efficacy and safety of monotherapy with LPV/r or arbidol in the treatment of mild/moderate COVID-19 patients.\n\nELACOI was a single-center, randomized and controlled trial conducted at Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital to preliminarily investigate the efficacy of LPV/r and arbidol in treating COVID-19 patients. This empirically exploratory study was designed to enroll 125 cases according to the estimated number of patients admitted to the hospital, which were randomly assigned (2:2:1) into 3 groups as follows.

In group B (arbidol group), 50 cases were given arbidol (100mg) (oral, 200mg TID for 7-14 days) monotherapy. In group C (control group), 25 cases were given no any antiviral medicine. All three groups were followed for up to 21 days. All three groups were treated with supportive care and effective oxygen therapy if in need. 5 Antiviral treatment was discontinued for patients who 1) had been treated for more than 7 days and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in two consecutive tests separated by more than 24 hours, or 2) discharged from hospital, or 3) had intolerable side effects.\n\nAll participants met the following inclusion criteria 1) age between 18 and 80 years old; 2) SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) from pharyngeal swab; 3) mild clinical status, defined as having mild clinical symptoms but no signs of pneumonia on imaging or moderate clinical status, defined as having fever, respiratory symptoms and pneumonia on imaging [5] ; 4) the following lab findings: creatinine \u2264110\u03bcmol/L, creatinine clearance rate (eGFR) \u226560 ml/min/1.73m 2 , aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \u22645 \u00d7 ULN, and total bilirubin (TBIL) \u22642 \u00d7 ULN; 5) willing to participate the study and sign the informed consent. Meanwhile, patients were excluded based on the following criteria 1) known or suspected to be allergic to LPV/r or arbidol; 2) having severe nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or other complaints affecting oral intake or absorption in the digestive tract; 3) taking other drugs that may interact with LPV/r or arbidol; 4) having serious underlying diseases, including but not limited to heart, lung, or kidney disease, liver malfunction, or mental diseases affecting treatment compliance; 5) complicating with pancreatitis or hemophilia prior to the trial; 6) Pregnant or lactating women; 7) having the suspected or confirmed history of alcohol or substance use disorder; 8) having participated in other drug trials in the past month; 9) deemed otherwise unsuitable for the study by the researchers. \n\nAll eligible participants were allocated to a randomization number which allocated him/her into one treatment group.

However, COVID-19 is a new emerging disease without any data to calculate the sample size. In addition, the trend of the epidemic was not clear while we were designing the study. Based on the estimated number of patients admitted to the hospital at that time, we estimate that a maximum of 125 patients can meet the inclusion criteria.\n\nAll statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (Statistical Package for SPSS, version 26.0). We presented continuous measurements as mean (SD) if the data were normally distributed or median (IQR) if they were not, and categorical variables as count (%). Means for continuous variables were compared using one-way ANOVA when the data were normally distributed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney test was used. Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the \u03c7 2 test or Fisher's exact tests.

Eleven (52.4%) cases in the LPV/r group, 9 (56.3%) cases in the arbidol group and 2 (28.6%) cases in the control group suffered from fever. Meanwhile, 19 (90.5%) cases in the LPV/r group, 9 (56.3%) cases in the arbidol group and 6 (85.7%) patients in the control group developed cough.

Moreover, 6 (28.6%) patients in the LPV/r group, 2 (12.5%) patients in the arbidol group, and 2 (28.6%) patients in the control group used glucocorticoids (methylprednisolone 40 mg, once a day, for 3-5 days) without statistical difference among 3 groups (P=0.547). Eighteen (85.7%) patients (13 patients using low flow supply, 5 using high flow oxygen supply) in the LPV/r group, 11 (68.8%) patients (9 patients using low flow, 2 high flow oxygen supply) in the arbidol group and 6 (85.7%) patients (all using low flow oxygen supply) in the control group received oxygen therapy, which did not show statistical difference (P =0.466) (table 1).\n\nDuring the follow-up period, 5 (23.8%) patients in the LPV/r group experienced adverse events including diarrhea (3/21,14.3%), loss of appetite (2/21, 9.5%) and elevation of ALT over 2.5-fold upper normal limit (1/21, 4.8%).\n\nNo apparent adverse events occurred in the arbidol group or in the control group.

Therefore, it is extremely important to find specific anti SARS-CoV-2 drugs and learn from the experience of Chinese health providers.\n\nOur study was designed to be an empirical exploration one intended to recruit 125 adult patients hospitalized with mild/moderate COVID-19; however, only 44 ones were involved in this study for the reasons mentioned above.

The results showed that LPV/r and arbidol did not shorten the time of positive-to-negative conversion of COVID-19 nucleic acid in respiratory specimens (8.5 vs. 7 vs. 4 days), nor improve the symptoms of COVID-19 or the pneumonia on lung CT imaging at 7 days and 14 days. Moreover, more patients treated with LPV/r progressed from mild/moderate to severe/critical status than other two groups.\n\nAlthough there were no significant differences in the treatment outcomes among these three groups at this study, it may be a kind of false negative results due to the small sample size. With more patient enrollment in the future, the conclusion of different or not different could be ensured. Notably, why did LPV/r and arbidol fail to benefit for those patients? The reason remains unclear. We speculate one reason is that LPV/r and arbidol may need dose increase to successfully suppress SARS-CoV-2 in human body according to the cytotoxicity test in vitro [8, 13, 14] , however, the dose increase is difficult to achieve clinically for the side effects of these drugs. In particular, it should be noted that patients treated with LPV/r had more gastrointestinal symptoms without achieving the definitely antiviral effect, which might affect the patient's recovery. The results in our study are consistent with findings from a recent clinical trial of LPV/r in adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19 conducted in Wuhan, which recruited 199 hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 and concluded that no benefit was observed with LPV/r treatment beyond standard care [20] .

Despite the small sample size, our study in another way indicates that monotherapy of LPV/r or arbidol might not improve the clinical outcome in treating with mild/moderate COVID-19.\n\nThe drug's side effect must also be seriously considered besides the efficacy.\n\nNotably, 5 (23.8%) patients in the LPV/r group experienced adverse events including 3 with diarrhea, 2 loss of appetite and one abnormal liver function, especially one serious adverse event reporting a 79-year-old man with diabetes and hypertension experienced severe diarrhea and progressed to critical condition ECMO with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid remaining positive over 14 days after treatment. Based on the drug instruction and experience of treating HIVinfected patients, the adverse reactions of the short-term use of LPV/r mainly include diarrhea, abnormal stools, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and asthenia [6] . Since above side effects may aggravate the disease, LPV/r treatment should be cautiously considered after weighing the risks and benefits.\n\nDuring the study period, totally 11 (25.0%) patients progressed to severe/critical clinical status including 8 receiving LPV/r, 2 receiving arbidol and 1 control, which rings the alarm bell that disease condition could still aggravate even after hospitalization, and urgently demands rigorous observation of illness and care.

This gives us great confidence that even if we do not have specific antiviral drugs, the vast majority of COVID-19 patients in severe/critical clinical status can still recover after comprehensive treatment.\n\nOur study is not without its limitations. First, the sample size is too small to reach the adequate power (1-Beta error > 0.8) in many parameters. Second, the study did not enroll severely or critically ill patients, or patients with many comorbidities who are at increased risk of poor outcome and was conducted in only one center. Third, the study was not completely blinded, so it is possible to influence the outcome. We will continue to follow these patients to evaluate their long-term prognosis. Therefore, the findings of this study require further verification and evaluation. Nevertheless, as a prospective randomized, controlled trial, this study could still provide meaningful suggestions for proper application of LPV/r and arbidol in the treatment of COVID-19.\n\nIn conclusion, our study found LPV/r or arbidol monotherapy seems little benefit for improving the clinical outcome of mild/moderate COVID-19, and LPV/r might lead to more adverse events. Due to the limitation of small sample size, further verification is needed in the future.\n\nLinghua Li, Xilong Deng and Yueping Li conceived the study and designed the All rights reserved.
