{"title": "Nosocomial infantile gastroenteritis associated with minirotavirus and calicivirus", "body": "laboratory culture; the standing of some of the small virus-like particles, both as viruses and pathogens, is unclear.\" Careful examination of some of these newer particles shows consistent morphologic characteristics, permitting a preliminary classification based on electronmicroscopic appearance.\" D Thus far only two reports have made a morphologic distinction amongst the small viruses.\u2022' 10 We report an investigation of nosocomial infantile gastroenteritis carried out on the general infant ward of The Montreal Children's Hospital in the late fall of 1976. Our data support the validity of the morphologic classification of enteritis viruses proposed by others,\":'? and add information on the clinical features and epidemiology (transmissibility) of infantile gastroenteritis associated with minirotavirus and calicivirus, and their potential to cause clinical enteritis in close contacts,\n\nAll ward patients were studied during the period October 8 to November 30, 1976.\u00b7 Accommodation comprised six three-crib rooms and one four-crib room, 0022\u00b73476/78/120922 + 05$00.5010 e 1978 The C. V. Mosby Co.\n\nMultiple pathogens were present in 12 index patients and five asymptoma tic room con tacts, Table I . Bacterial pathogens and virus-like particles identified in stool from infants with diarrhea and asymptomatic room contacts culture of each patient with diarrhea were tested for enterotoxin production, using the infant mouse assay,\" and the YI adrenal cell assay methods.\" Control strains of E. coli were kindly provided by Dr. D.A. Sack. Assays were carried out in triplicate.\n\nThe predominant lactose-fermenting colony type from each infant with diarrhea was tested for invasiveness by the guinea pig eye inoculation (Sereny) test.\" An inoculum of I drop of a very heavy suspension of the organism in Mueller-Hinton broth (at 5 X lO\" cells per ml) was used. One hundred and sixty-five infants aged 9 days to 24 months (median 4 months) were studied; 41 had diarrhea, comprising 8 of 16 infants resident at outset, and 33 of 149 newly admitted infants. Two to eight new cases occurred per week; 26 cases were considered nosocomial. Two' infants each had two periods of diarrhea, and one had three, for a total of 45 diarrhea episodes. Eighty-one room contacts of infants with diarrhea remained asymptomatic, and specimens from 74 were available for examination.\n\nA putative stool pathogen was identified in 31 of 45 case episodes (69%), and in 31 of 74 (42%) asymptomatic room contacts (Table I) . Bacterial pathogens were isolated from seven infants, four of whom coincidentally carried a virus. Concurrent infection with two agents occurred in 10 patients, and with three agents in two, without evidence of an agent:agent pattern.\n\nViruses. Six morphologic classes of virus-like particles were present in stools from 28 of 45 episodes of diarrhea \n\nPatients with pathogens situated either side of a walk-through corridor. Diarrhea was defined as an increase in the usual daily stool frequency by two or more, and excessive water loss in stool. When symptoms began more than 24 hours after admission to hospital, the infections were considered to be nosocomial.\n\nStool specimens were obtained from resident infants on the first or second day of the study, and from newly admitted patients as soon as available after admission to the study ward. When possible, specimens were obtained from infants with diarrhea at daily intervals for the first three days of their illness, and at varia ble intervals for up to four days after diarrhea had ceased. Specimens were also obtained from asymptomatic room contacts of infants with diarrhea, usually on the first and fourth days following the onset of symptoms in the index case. Specimens were not obtained from medical or nursing staff.\n\nVirus identification. Stool was suspended in phosphatebuffered saline (at 10% w Iv) and stored at -20\u00b0C. Specimens were subsequently thawed, clarified by lowspeed centrifugation (3,000 g) for 10 minutes, and 2 ml aliquots concentrated by ultracentrifugation (100,000 g) for 1 hour. The pellet was resuspended in a drop of 1% ammonium acetate solution, and examined using a Philips 201 or 300 electronmicroscope.\" Virus-like particles were sought in at least 5 grid squares, and classified as described by Flewett\" and by Middleton et al.\"\n\nSpecimens containing adenovirus particles were inoculated into tissue cultures ofHEp-2 and human embryonic lung cells. Cytopathogenic effect was confirmed by a second passage, and adenovirus isolates were typed by neutralization tests. Specimens from room contacts of adenovirus positive infants with diarrhea were cultured in the same way.\n\nSpecimens containing picorna-parvovirus particles were inoculated onto primary Rhesus monkey kidney cells, and isolates identified by cytopathogenic effect on second passage and electronmicroscopic appearance. Particles were classified as polioviruses or non-polio enteroviruses by neutralization tests.\n\nBacterial identification. All specimens were examined for Salmonella and Shigella by conventional methods, and for enteropathogenic serotypes of Escherichia coli by slide agglutination using a battery of 16 commercially prepared antisera (Difco). The predominant E. coli colony type from an early specimen culture of each infant with diarrhea was sent to The Laboratory Centre for Disease Control, Ottawa, for complete serotyping. Incubation at 4\u00b0C was used for enhanced recovery of Yersinia enterocolitica. ' (62%), and in 24 of 74 (32%) asymptomatic room contacts (Table I) . These included adenovirus, rota virus, minirotavirus (Fig. I) , calicivirus (Fig. 2) , picorna-parvovirus, and coronavirus. Minirotavirus is the name we have chosen for a 32 nm particle, wh ich resembles particles identified in Toronto (rninireovirus)\" and in Glasgow .\" It is distinguished from other sm all round viruses by its slightly larger size and its irregular margin, at times resembling a palisade of very small ca psomeres. Caliciviruses tend to be smaller than minirotaviruses, and are dist inguished by their scalloped or coarsely indente d surface appearance. Both viruses have variation s in surface detail, depending on their lie on the grid and their state of preservation. Picorna-p arvoviruses are small dense particles, with an entire margin, and no detectable surface structure. Ten of 26 nosocomial cases showed virus particle concordance with their presumed index source (Ta ble 11). Eight of 24 virus positive asymptomatic room contacts showed similar concordance. With the exception of one asymptomatic acquisition of rotavirus, viral concordance between infants with diarrhea and their room contacts was limited to minirotavirus and calicivirus, Concordance between asymptomatic infants excreting virus and their respective room contacts was also limited to minirotavirus, which was found in three of 15 contacts, none of whom developed diarrhea. Correlation of symptoms with virus acqu isition was variable : to of 17 infants with either rniniro tavirus or caliclvirus developed diarrhea (Table II) .\n\nTwelve infants with dia rrhea had no id entifia ble pathogen in the stoo l, of whom nine exposed 26 room contacts. Twenty -five contacts remained asymptomatic and had negative stool examinations. One had diarrhea associated with picorna-parvovirus.\n\nBacteria. Two serotypes of enteropathogenic E. coli were identified in specimens from four infants with diarrhea, three of whom coincidentally carried a virus. These and two other enteropathogenic serotypes were also identified as the only pathogen in seven of 74 asymptomatic contacts. There was no evidence of spread of these enteropathogenic serot ypes in the infants studied, and complete serot yping of 55 isolates of E. coli from 35 infants with diarrhea also failed to show an epidemiologic pattern in this symptomatic population . None of th e commonly recognized enterotoxigenic serotypes was idenrifled.\" Also none of these same 55 isolates of E. coli was invasive, evidenced by negative Sereny tests .\n\nStools from one infant with diarrhea were consis tently positive for a strain of E. coli (O?:K ?:H4) producing heat stable and labile enterotoxins. The same specimens contained aden ovirus (tissue culture negative). Isolates of E. coli obtained from parents and two siblings were enterotoxin negative, and none was found to carry E. coli (0? :K?:H4).\n\nSalmonella typhimurium and Y. enterocolitica were the only pathogens identified in one index patient each . Neither elise was nosocomial and transmission to room contacts did not occur.\n\nMost studies of nosocomial gastroenteritis have concerned epidemics of diarrhea in closed patient populations, often attributed to single agents. This study differs in the open nature of the population, The ward continued to accept new patients throughout, while attempting to discharge, transfer, or cohort those with diarrhea. No infant with a history of recent loose stools was accepted into the ward: about half of the new patients had acute respiratory disease. Respiratory isolation priorities led to frequent room changes and may, in part, explain the high incidence of nosocomial diarrhea and acquisition of viruses by one third of asymptomatic infants studied. It does not, however, explain the variety of virus particles identified. It seems likely that once the large and varied reservoir of pathogens had been established, the continued admission of new patients and their rapid turnover permitted survival of individual agents at a low level of endemicity.\n\nInfants were not followed after discharge from hospital, ,and our data are probably a low estimate of the prevalence of nosocomial diarrhea and communicability of viruses in the study population.\n\nAlmost half of the instances of diarrhea were associated with either minirotavirus or calicivirus in stool. Their claim as true viruses and potential pathogens is su pported by the temporal ass ociation of fecal carriage and presence of diarrhea, and evidence of communicability from infant to infant. In one sequence, lateral transmission of calicivirus could be traced through a chain of seven infants. In another exceptional instance, an infant had intractable diarrhea for several weeks, the course of which was punctuated by two periods of vomiting associated with fecal shedding of minirotavirus and calicivirus, respectively. Two other infants had separate attacks of diarrhea and vomiting associated with minirotavirus and calicivirus.\n\nSeven of 12 infants without diarrhea but with miniro- (Table I) had repeated vomiting coincident with the presence of virus in the stool, and two others had loose stools without an increase in daily frequency. Vomiting was as frequent an association as diarrhea in patients found to carry these viruses (Table  III) . Vomiting is also a prominent feature of rotavirus gastroenteritis,\" but low-grade fever was present in only three of 20 infants with diarrhea associated with minirotavirus and calicivirus, We have been unsuccessful in attempts to cultivate minirotavirus and calicivirus using human fetal intestinal organ culture, human embryonic kidney cells, monkey kidney eells, human embryonic lung, and HEp-7 cell lines . Adenovirus was a relatively common finding in stool examined by electronmicroscopy, but poor correlation with symptoms and its occurrence with other agents obscure its significance. Communicability was not demonstrated by either electronmicroscopy or tissue culture methods. Culture using HEp-2 cells was successful in six of eight specimens from infants with diarrhea, and has been sustained with five isolates iden tified as adenovirus types 2 (two isolates), and 7 (three isolates).\n\nRotavirus played a smaller role than expected, and transmission could only be presumed in one asymptomatic room contact. This may reflect the bias of small numbers, for there is no doubt that rota virus can assert its presence in an open infant ward:' Seasonal variations seem to affect identification rates of enteritis-associated viruses in a similar manner.\"\n\nPicoma-parvoviruses particles appeared to be a random finding in stool and were not shown to be communicable. Enteroviruses were identified in five of eight specimens examined by tissue culture, two of which were identified as polioviruses,\n\nThe yield of bacterial pathogens in this study was meagre, and the data are largely negative. Classical enteropathogenic serotypes of E. coli occurred sporadically, and three of four affected infants with diarrhea carried a virus in the same specimen. Sequential specimens from one infant with diarrhea contained an enterotoxinproducing strain of E. coli, but the same specimen contained an adenovirus. Screening of five lactosefermenting organisms from more than 400 infants with diarrhea seen at this hospital (1975) (1976) ) has yielded only one other enterotoxin producing strain ofE. coli (06:H 16),\n\nin an infant who acquired diarrhea in Pakistan (unpublished data).\n\nWe found that multiple putative pathogens were operating concurrently and independently in the study population. Approximately half of the cases of diarrhea were associated with either minirotavirus or calicivirus, whose standing as etiologic agents is strengthened by the data presented. Community-based epidemiologic studies, serology, and virus culture win be necessary to substantiate the pathogenic role of these viruses."}
