{"title": "Antigenic Subversion: A Novel Mechanism of Host Immune Evasion by Ebola Virus", "body": "Ebola virus (EBOV) is an enveloped single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus in the order Mononegavirales, which along with the Marburg virus (MARV) forms the Filovirus family. EBOV is the etiologic agent of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF), a highly lethal hemorrhagic fever with up to 90% mortality [1]. Since its discovery in 1976, EBOV has caused sporadic outbreaks in Sub-Saharan Africa with death tolls in the hundreds. Interestingly, while filoviruses have been only recently discovered, they are one of the few non-retrovirus RNA paleoviruses identified in mammalian genomes, suggesting an ancient relationship with mammals [2], [3]. Growing evidence suggests that bats are the natural reservoir of EBOV in the wild today [4]\u2013[6].\n\nCurrent treatment for Ebola hemorrhagic fever is purely supportive, and the lack of effective interventions underscores the importance of developing a broadly-protective vaccine that confers long-lasting immunity. The ability to develop such a vaccine is critically dependent on our understanding of the mechanisms by which EBOV suppresses, distracts, or otherwise evades the host immune response [7]. One widely hypothesized immune evasion mechanism employed by Ebola virus is secretion of a truncated viral glycoprotein by EBOV infected cells. The EBOV surface glycoprotein (GP1,2) mediates host cell attachment and fusion, and is the primary structural component exposed on the virus surface. For this reason, GP1,2 is the focus of most EBOV vaccine research, and it is generally accepted that a robust anti-GP1,2 antibody response is crucial for protection against lethal EBOV challenge [8]. EBOV GP1,2 forms trimeric spikes on virion surfaces similarly to influenza HA and HIV Env [9]. Also like HA and Env, GP is first synthesized as an uncleaved precursor (GP0) which is then cleaved in the Golgi complex by the protease furin [10] into two functional subunits: The N-terminal GP1 subunit contains the putative receptor-binding domain (RBD), and the C-terminal GP2 subunit contains the fusion apparatus and transmembrane domain. GP1,2 is encoded in two disjointed reading frames in the virus genome. The two reading frames are joined together by slippage of the viral polymerase at an editing site (a tract of 7-A's) to insert an 8th A, generating an mRNA transcript that allows read-through translation of GP1,2\n[11], [12]. However, only about 20% of transcripts are edited, while the remaining 80% of unedited transcripts have a premature stop codon, resulting in synthesis of a truncated glycoprotein product (sGP) which is secreted in large quantities into the extracellular space.\n\nThough its production is conserved in all EBOV species, there has been considerable debate regarding the function of sGP. Unlike GP1,2, sGP forms homodimers and appears to have some intrinsic anti-inflammatory activity [13]\u2013[17]. The recent finding that EBOV quickly mutates to synthesize primarily GP1,2 in cell culture, while this mutant virus reverts to a primarily sGP-producing phenotype in vivo, suggests an important role for sGP in virus survival within the host [18]. Because sGP shares over 90% of its sequence with the N-terminal region of GP1,2, it was initially hypothesized that sGP functions as a decoy for anti-GP1,2 antibodies. Early efforts to identify such activity yielded mixed results, and the observation that antibodies often do not cross-react between sGP and GP1,2 had cast doubt on this hypothesis [19]\u2013[23]. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrated that immunization against GP1,2 elicits antibodies largely against epitopes not shared with sGP [24]\u2013[27]. However, most of these studies investigated monoclonal antibodies from animals immunized with vaccines containing or expressing primarily GP1,2, which does not represent the state of natural infection. Of note, one early study examined monoclonal antibodies from mice immunized with a Venezuelan equine encephalitis replicon that produces both GP1,2 and sGP, and found that many of these antibodies cross-reacted between GP1,2 and sGP [28]. Further, monoclonal antibodies isolated from human EHF survivors have been shown to preferentially react with sGP [19]. These studies suggest that sGP may play an important role in altering the host antibody response.\n\nIn this study, we demonstrate that sGP induces a host antibody response that focuses on epitopes it shares with GP1,2, thereby allowing it to bind and compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies. We describe a mechanism that we term \u201cantigenic subversion\u201d, which is distinct from previously proposed \u201cdecoy\u201d mechanisms in which secreted glycoprotein simply passively absorbs anti-glycoprotein antibodies. Importantly, we demonstrate that sGP can also subvert an existing anti-GP1,2 immune response that was only weakly cross-reactive with sGP. Antigenic subversion represents a novel host immune evasion mechanism that has important implications for EBOV vaccine design, and may shed light on how the virus survives in its natural reservoir.\n\nWe first generated EBOV GP constructs to individually express GP1,2 and sGP. In natural infection, EBOV directs the synthesis of sGP and GP1,2 through differentially edited mRNA transcripts (Fig. 1A). However, it has been observed that DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (DDRP) do not edit with the same efficiency as the EBOV RNA polymerase [12]. Furthermore, in addition to polymerase slippage, it is possible that the 7-A editing site can also serve as a premature poly-adenylation signal, as well as a ribosomal slippage signal [29]\u2013[31]. We thus generated a panel of EBOV GP editing site mutants in order to control the levels of sGP and GP1,2 expression (Fig. 1B). GP-8A was made by inserting an 8th A into the wild type (GP-7A) editing site, resulting in GP1,2 as the dominant gene product. Silent A\u2192G mutations were introduced into the GP-8A editing site to ablate transcriptional slippage, resulting in GP1,2Edit, that expresses GP1,2 as the sole gene product. The same mutations were also introduced into GP-7A to generate sGPEdit, that expresses sGP as the sole gene product. These constructs were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector (pCAGGS) and protein expression was examined in both HeLa cells (Fig. 1C) and 293T cells (data not shown). Cells transfected with GP-8A and GP1,2Edit expressed GP1,2 intracellularly and on their surfaces, and secreted GP1,2 into the supernatant through previously characterized TACE-dependent cleavage [32]. Interestingly, GP1,2Edit produced higher amounts of GP1,2 than GP-8A. GP-7A and sGPEdit expressed high levels of sGP, which was secreted efficiently into the supernatant. GP1,2 expression by GP-7A was undetectable, likely because of minimal DDRP-mediated editing [12]. These expression experiments demonstrate that mutation of the editing site has a significant effect on GP expression.\n\nWe next investigated the immunogenicity of editing site mutant DNA vaccines. Female BALB/c mice were immunized with GP1,2 or sGP-producing constructs (Fig. 2A). Mice immunized with sGPEdit, GP-7A, and GP-8A constructs developed similar titers of anti-GP1,2 antibodies as measured by ELISA, while mice immunized with GP1,2Edit developed four-fold higher titers of anti-GP1,2 antibodies (Fig. 2B). Mice immunized with constructs expressing predominantly sGP (GP-7A and sGPEdit) developed much higher titers of anti-sGP antibodies than mice immunized with constructs expressing predominantly GP1,2 (GP-8A or GP1,2Edit) (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2D, GP1,2-immunized mice developed much higher titers of GP1,2-binding antibodies than sGP-binding antibodies. On the other hand, sGP-immunized mice developed much higher titers of sGP-binding antibodies than GP1,2-binding antibodies, despite the fact that sGP shares roughly 95% of its linear sequence with GP1,2. These results suggest that in sGP-immunized animals, either many sGP-binding antibodies are directed against conformational epitopes not shared with GP1,2, or they are directed against shared epitopes that are inaccessible in GP1,2.\n\nGiven that animals immunized by GP1,2 or sGP develop antibodies that preferentially bind to different GP isoforms, we performed Western blot analysis to determine if there is a difference in the linear epitopes targeted by antibodies in GP1,2 versus sGP-immunized mice. As shown in Fig. 3A, antisera from GP1,2-immunized mice reacted strongly with GP1,2 but only weakly with sGP. On the other hand, antisera from sGP-immunized mice reacted strongly with sGP, but only weakly with GP1,2. This suggests that most linear epitopes targeted by anti-GP1,2 antibodies from GP1,2-immunized mice are unshared with sGP. To investigate whether the GP1,2-binding and sGP-binding antibodies in immunized mice were cross-reactive between the two GP isoforms or were separate populations of antibodies, we performed a competition ELISA to determine if sGP could compete with GP1,2 for GP1,2-binding antibodies (Fig. 3B). Similar to the Western blot data, sGP was unable to compete for binding of anti-GP1,2 antibodies from GP1,2 immunized mice (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, sGP was able to efficiently compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies from sGP-immunized mice. As expected, GP1,2 was able to compete with itself in all groups (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, we observed an identical reactivity pattern with native membrane-anchored EBOV GP1,2 using a cell surface competition ELISA (Supplemental Fig. S1). We further examined the ability of the two GP isoforms to compete with each other for antibodies by performing competition immunoprecipitation. Purified GP1,2 in the presence of sGP at varying molar ratios was immunoprecipitated with antiserum from GP1,2-immunized or sGP-immunized mice, and analyzed by Western blot using a polyclonal rabbit antibody that reacts with both GP isoforms. Antiserum from GP1,2-immunized mice precipitated both GP1,2 and sGP, and increasing concentrations of sGP did not attenuate the amount of GP1,2 signal (Fig. 3E), suggesting the presence of two separate populations of antibodies that do not cross-react between GP1,2 and sGP. However, while antiserum from sGP-immunized mice also precipitated both GP1,2 and sGP, increasing concentrations of sGP significantly attenuated the amount of GP1,2 precipitated (Fig. 3F), indicating that GP1,2-reactive antibodies in these mice are cross-reactive with sGP. As a control, addition of recombinant HA had no effect on the amount of GP1,2 precipitated by either antiserum group. Taken together, these data suggest that anti-GP1,2 antibodies induced by GP1,2 are directed primarily against epitopes not shared between GP1,2 and sGP, whereas such antibodies induced by sGP are directed against epitopes shared between GP1,2 and sGP.\n\nWe further investigated whether there was a difference in the ability of antisera from the immunization groups to neutralize EBOV GP1,2-mediated virus infection, and whether sGP could interfere with antibody-mediated neutralization. Pseudoviruses were generated using an Env-deficient HIV backbone pseudotyped with Zaire EBOV GP1,2. In order to achieve consistent neutralization, we pooled sera from the four highest responders among GP1,2-immunized animals and among sGP-immunized animals. Antisera from both groups were able to effectively neutralize pseudoviruses as measured by a luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 4A), although antisera from GP1,2-immunized mice exhibited more potent neutralizing activity than antisera from sGP-immunized mice, probably due to higher overall anti-GP1,2 titer. To determine if sGP interferes with neutralization, we used an antiserum dilution corresponding to 80% neutralizing activity in each group and preincubated antisera with different amounts of sGP. Consistent with the competition ELISA results, sGP was able to completely attenuate neutralizing activity of antisera from sGP-immunized mice, while it had no effect on neutralizing activity of antisera from GP1,2-immunized mice (Fig. 4B). Purified influenza HA was used as a control and had no effect on neutralizing activity of either antiserum group. Similar results were observed when we used an antiserum dilution corresponding to 50% neutralizing activity (Supplemental Fig. S2). These data confirm that sGP can compete with GP1,2 for anti-GP1,2 antibodies and interfere with antibody-mediated neutralization, but can only do so in animals that have been exposed to sGP.\n\nThe inability of sGP to compete with GP1,2 for antibodies from GP1,2-immunized mice was intriguing considering that GP1,2 shares almost half of its ectodomain sequence with sGP. We reasoned that some of these antibodies may be directed solely against GP1,2 epitopes not shared with sGP, while other antibodies may be directed against shared epitopes, but preferentially bind GP1,2 because of conformational differences between the two GP isoforms resulting from tertiary and quarternary structure and steric shielding. To address this possibility, we used quantitiative ELISA to determine the relative titers and estimate the average affinity of antibodies from GP1,2 and sGP-immunized animals for GP1,2 and sGP. We individually examined purified polyclonal IgG from the five highest responders in GP1,2-immunized and sGP-immunized groups, and calculated the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of anti-GP1,2 and anti-sGP antibodies. This apparent Kd was calculated by Scatchard analysis as described elsewhere [33], [34] and represents an estimate of the average affinity of anti-GP antibodies, with lower apparent Kd correponding to higher average affinity. Consistent with above ELISA data (Fig. 2D), mice immunized against GP1,2 had higher titers of anti-GP1,2 antibodies than anti-sGP antibodies (Fig. 5A). However, there was no measurable difference in the apparent Kd's of GP1,2-binding vs. sGP-binding antibodies (Fig. 5B), indicating that preferential binding of antibodies from these animals to GP1,2 is not due to affinity differences for different GP isoforms. In mice immunized against sGP we again observed very high titers of anti-sGP antibodies, and very low levels of anti-GP1,2 antibodies. However, those antibodies that did bind to GP1,2 appeared to have modestly lower Kd (higher average affinity) than did sGP-binding antibodies (Fig. 5B). Future studies with monoclonal antibodies directed against epitopes shared between sGP and GP1,2 will provide further information on whether specific antibodies bind to the two GP isoforms with different affinities. Nonetheless, the present data provide evidence that differences in affinity are not responsible for antibodies from GP1,2 and sGP-immunized mice reacting preferentially with different GP isoforms.\n\nThe secretion of surface glycoproteins as a mechanism of absorbing antiviral antibodies has been hypothesized before for several viruses including vesicular stomatitis virus (soluble G) and respiratory syncytial virus (secreted G) [35], [36]. It has been demonstrated that RSV secreted G can absorb anti-G antibodies and interfere with both neutralization and antibody-dependent cell-mediated virus clearance. However, we observed that EBOV sGP can only compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies in mice immunized against sGP. This led us to hypothesize that sGP may serve a role in altering the repertoire of epitopes against which the host immune response is directed, in order to divert the host immune response towards epitopes shared between sGP and GP1,2. To test this hypothesis, we vaccinated mice with a 3\u22361 ratio of sGPEdit\u2236GP1,2Edit (Fig. 6A) to simulate antigen expression during EBOV infection. Control groups were immunized with either sGPEdit or GP1,2Edit plus empty pCAGGS vector to keep the total amount of DNA constant. As a proxy for in vivo antigen expression, HeLa cells were transfected with corresponding ratios of sGPEdit, GP1,2Edit, and pCAGGS. As measured by Western blot analysis, the levels of sGP and GP1,2 expression in both lysate and culture supernatant of cells co-transfected with sGPEdit and GP1,2Edit were similar to cells transfected with sGPEdit or GP1,2Edit alone (Fig. S3). All immunization groups generated similar titers of anti-GP1,2 antibodies (Fig. 6B). However, when we performed a competition ELISA using antisera from sGPEdit+ GP1,2Edit-immunized mice, sGP was able to compete with GP1,2 for over 50% of the anti-GP1,2 antibodies (Fig. 6C). Mice immunized with GP1,2Edit+vector or sGPEdit+vector displayed the same serum reactivity patterns we had observed previously in mice immunized against only one of the GP isoforms. Further, after boosting mice a second time, almost 70% of GP1,2-antibodies in week 12 antisera from sGPEdit+ GP1,2Edit-immunized mice were absorbed by sGP. Interestingly, in mice immunized with lower ratios of sGPEdit\u2236GP1,2Edit, significant sGP cross-reactivity was also observed, with almost 70% of anti-GP1,2 antibodies being susceptible to competition in mice immunized with a 1\u22361 ratio of sGP\u2236GP1,2, and about 25% being susceptible to competition in mice immunized with a 1\u22363 ratio of sGP\u2236GP1,2 (Figure S4). Similar results were also obtained with a competition immunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig. 6D, antiserum from sGPEdit+GP1,2Edit-immunized mice was able to precipitate both GP1,2 and sGP, but increasing concentrations of sGP attenuated the amount of GP1,2 precipitated. Furthermore, while sGPEdit+GP1,2Edit antiserum was able to effectively neutralize pseudovirus infectivity (Fig. 6E), the addition of exogenous sGP almost completely inhibited pseudovirus neutralization (Fig. 6F), indicating that sGP can effectively interfere with antibody mediated neutralization in these mice. Similar observations were also made at an antiserum concentration corresponding to 50% neutralization (Fig. S5). Taken together, these data confirm that sGP can direct the host antibody response to focus on epitopes shared between GP1,2 and sGP, thereby allowing sGP to compete for antibodies and interfere with antibody-mediated virus neutralization. Furthermore, the observation that sGP can compete for a greater proportion of GP1,2 antibodies from week 12 antisera compared to week 6 suggests that iterative exposure to sGP gradually drives the host to a dominantly sGP-reactive response.\n\nIn order to test the hypothesis that expression of sGP can modulate the GP1,2-specific antibody response, we primed and boosted mice with either sGPEdit or GP1,2Edit, and then boosted again at week 10 with the opposite GP isoform (Fig. 7A). Control groups were boosted with the same GP isoform. As shown in Fig. 7B, anti-GP1,2 antibodies were induced in all groups at week 12. However, in mice immunized with GP1,2Edit and then boosted with sGPEdit, sGP was able to efficiently compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies in competition ELISA (Fig. 7C). Furthermore, sGP was also able to efficiently compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies from mice primed against sGPEdit and boosted with GP1,2Edit. We next investigated whether sGP is able interfere with virus neutralization by sera from cross primed and boosted mice. As shown in Fig. 7D, sGP was able to interfere with neutralization only from animals primed against sGP and boosted with GP1,2. On the other hand, antisera from animals primed against GP1,2 and boosted with sGP maintained their neutralizing activity in the presence of sGP. To further probe this observation, we compared the antisera titers corresponding to 50% neutralizing activity (NT50) in groups before (week 6) and after (week 12) boosting with the opposite GP isoform. As shown in Fig. 7E, neutralizing activity is not boosted by immunization with the opposite GP isoform. Thus, it appears not only that sGP can overwhelm the GP1,2-specific response, but also that it only boosts non-neutralizing antibodies induced by GP1,2. The observation that sGP can alter the reactivity profile of the anti-GP1,2 response has important implications for EBOV vaccinology, since during a infection, sGP could subvert the immune response of a previously vaccinated individual if the virus is not cleared rapidly.\n\nThe role of sGP in EBOV host immune evasion has not been clearly defined. In this study, we analyzed antibody responses in mice immunized against sGP, GP1,2, or both GP isoforms and present evidence that sGP serves to redirect the immune response towards epitopes that are either not present or inaccessible in GP1,2, or epitopes that are shared between the two GP isoforms, thereby allowing sGP to effectively absorb anti-GP1,2 antibodies. We term this phenomenon \u201cantigenic subversion\u201d, because it is distinct from previously proposed mechanisms in which sGP passively absorbs anti-glycoprotein antibodies. In antigenic subversion, the ability of sGP to absorb anti-GP1,2 antibodies is critically dependent on exposure to sGP during induction of the anti-GP1,2 immune response. In mice immunized against GP1,2 in the presence of sGP, an immunization strategy designed to simulate antigen exposure during natural infection, we observed that most resulting anti-GP1,2 antibodies were cross reactive with and thus susceptible to competition by sGP, even though the titers of anti-GP1,2 antibodies in these mice were similar to the titers in mice immunized against GP1,2 alone. On the other hand, in mice immunized against GP1,2 alone, we observed only low cross-reactivity of anti-GP1,2 antibodies with sGP, a finding consistent with previous studies, indicating that antibodies in these mice are largely directed against epitopes not shared with sGP [23], [24].\n\nThe model we propose for the mechanism of antigenic subversion by sGP assumes that before immunization, the host begins with a repertoire of na\u00efve B-cells that recognize epitopes distributed throughout GP1,2 and sGP (Fig. 8A). However, because sGP is generated in much higher quantities than GP1,2, B-cells that recognize sGP epitopes and epitopes shared between sGP and GP1,2 are more likely to encounter their cognate antigens as compared with B-cells that recognize GP1,2-specific epitopes. Furthermore, as the sGP-reactive B-cell population expands, it will outcompete other B-cells for antigen and survival signals. Thus, the humoral response is skewed towards sGP, and epitopes of GP1,2 that are shared with sGP. Antigenic subversion represents a novel viral escape strategy that has some similarities to original antigenic sin (OAS). In classical OAS, initial exposure to a pathogen results in a population of memory B-cells that recognize antigens specific to that pathogen strain. Upon subsequent exposure to a different strain of the same pathogen, cross-reactive memory B-cells will respond preferentially, producing antibodies with high affinity to the initial pathogen which may not bind to the new strain as effectively [37], [38]. Furthermore, these memory B-cells can compete for antigen and survival signals with na\u00efve B-cells that might otherwise produce higher affinity or more protective antibodies to the new strain. Similarly, overexpression by Ebola virus of sGP ensures that sGP-reactive B-cells preferentially expand and outcompete GP1,2-specific B-cells for antigen and survival signals, resulting in a suboptimal host response that is directed away from membrane-bound GP1,2 on the virion surface. However, unlike classical OAS, this process does not require temporal separation of antigen encounters, but can also occur during simultaneous exposure to two partly identical antigens.\n\nOur model for antigenic subversion can also explain how anti-GP1,2 antibodies from animals primed against sGP and then boosted with GP1,2 maintain cross-reactivity with sGP. In these animals, priming with sGP elicits antibodies against sGP epitopes, some of which are shared with GP1,2 (Fig. 8B). When these animals are boosted with GP1,2, memory B-cells that recognize shared epitopes vastly outnumber (and express higher affinity receptors than) the na\u00efve B-cells that recognize unshared epitopes. Thus, the anti-sGP memory B-cells will be preferentially activated and expanded, boosting the anti-sGP response. This situation is analogous to one in which previously-infected individuals are vaccinated against GP1,2, and raises the possibility that immunizing such individuals may simply boost an already unprotective antibody response. While filovirus infection is rare, our findings suggest that it may be necessary to devise alternate strategies for immunizing previously-infected individuals in a way that specifically boosts the anti-GP1,2 response and avoids subversion.\n\nPerhaps the most striking finding in this study is that boosting GP1,2-immunized mice with sGP could effectively subvert the anti-GP1,2 response and render it susceptible to competition by sGP. We hypothesize that while the majority of B-cells activated in mice immunized against GP1,2 are directed against epitopes not shared with sGP (Fig. 8C), there is a small population of activated B-cells that react with sGP. This is supported by our observation that even though sGP cannot measurably compete in ELISA and immunoprecipitation for anti-GP1,2 antibodies from GP1,2-immunized mice, these mice still develop low titers of sGP-binding antibodies. When GP1,2-immunized mice are boosted with sGP, these sGP-reactive B-cells expand while the remaining GP1,2-specific B-cells that recognize unshared epitopes do not, shifting the anti-GP1,2 antibody response from mostly GP1,2-specific to mostly sGP-cross reactive. Furthermore, it is notable that neutralizing activity actually decreased after boosting with sGP, despite an increase in overall anti-GP1,2 antibodies. Thus, boosting with sGP only augmented non-neutalizing anti-GP1,2 antibodies that are highly susceptible to sGP competition, while the existing neutralizing antibodies previously induced by GP1,2 in these mice maintained resistence to sGP interference. This situation is analogous to one in which an individual is immunized against GP1,2 is subsequently infected with EBOV. If the individual is unable to rapidly clear the virus, the virus may replicate sufficiently to subvert the host immune response. Thus, it will be critical for vaccines to induce high enough titers of anti-GP1,2 antibodies to ensure that the virus is cleared before it is able to effect subversion (Fig. 8D).\n\nThe inability of sGP to compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies from GP1,2-immunized mice is consistent with a growing body of evidence pointing to the immunodominance of the GP1,2 mucin domain, a highly glycosylated region of GP1 not shared with sGP [24], [25]. This domain is thought to form a sterically bulky \u201ccloak\u201d that shields the putative receptor binding domain from host antibodies, as suggested for the HIV Env \u201cglycan shield\u201d [39]. The role that the mucin domain plays in host-pathogen interaction is complex and previous studies indicate that this region contains both neutralizing and infection-enhancing epitopes, and can mask epitopes on GP1,2 itself by steric occlusion [40], [41]. Furthermore, the mucin domain is the most divergent region of GP1,2 among EBOV strains, and is dispensible for GP1,2 mediated virus attachment and membrane fusion [42]\u2013[44], strongly suggesting a role in protecting more functionally conserved regions of GP1,2 from immune attack. Because the linear sequence of sGP corresponds to the putative mucin-shielded receptor binding domain (RBD) of GP1, it is possible that sGP works together with the mucin domain so that host antibodies are directed either to shared epitopes that are sterically shielded in the GP1,2 trimer, or to the mucin domain itself, which is cleaved off in the host cell acidified endosome along with any bound antibodies [45], [46]. The possibility that GP1,2 epitopes shared with sGP may be shielded in the GP1,2 trimer is supported by our observation that very few anti-sGP antibodies in sGP-immunized mice cross-react with GP1,2 despite the fact that sGP shares over 90% of its linear sequence with GP1,2. Furthermore, antigenic subversion allows sGP to efficiently absorb those antibodies that do recognize unshielded and shared epitopes in GP1,2.\n\nThe importance of sGP-mediated antigenic subversion to EHF pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. Passive immunization studies with polyclonal sera or monoclonal antibodies will reveal whether sGP-crossreactive antibodies are in fact less protective than GP1,2-specific antibodies. This is particularly important given that passive transfer of anti-EBOV monoclonal antibodies has gained traction recently as a post-exposure therapeutic. If sGP cross-reactivity turns out to be correlated with impaired virus clearance, it would underscore the need to elicit and produce GP1,2-specific antisera or monoclonal antibodies for achieving more effective treatment of EBOV infection. Moreover, our findings also suggest that EBOV vaccines should be tailored to target regions not shared between sGP and GP1,2. This is particularly relevant to recent efforts to develop a broadly-protective vaccine, since these studies have centered around focusing vaccines on conserved epitopes by deleting highly variable regions of GP1,2 such as the mucin domain [24], [43], [47]. Because sGP actually corresponds to the most highly conserved region of GP1, antibodies elicited by these constructs may be cross-reactive with sGP and therefore susceptible to sGP-mediated subversion. Candidate pan-filovirus vaccines may need to be focused on regions of GP1,2 that are both highly conserved and unshared with sGP, such as the membrane-proximal GP2 subunit.\n\nIt will also be of great interest for EBOV vaccinology to determine whether antigenic subversion correlates with successes and failures of vaccines to protect animals against lethal challenge. It may be critical for an EBOV vaccine to elicit a long lasting immune response with high enough antibody titers so the host can clear the virus before it is able to replicate and effect antigenic subversion. This possibility is consistent with nonhuman primate lethal challenge experiments, in which survival was most closely correlated with maintenance of anti-GP1,2 antibody titers above a threshold level, while lower antibody titers only delayed the time to death [48]. Further, while much of EBOV vaccinology has focused on eliciting protective antibodies against the membrane-bound glycoprotein, a robust T-cell response may also improve vaccine efficacy. Immunization of nonhuman primates with a low dose of GP and nucleoprotein (NP)-expressing recombinant adenoviruses was demonstrated to elicit robust antibody and T-cell responses and confer protection against lethal challenge [49]. More importantly, EBOV-specific T-cells were shown to reduce the threshold of anti-GP1,2 antibodies needed for protection. Recombinant vectors expressing CTL epitopes have been demonstrated to confer protection to lethal EBOV challenge in mice, and GP-specific as well as nucleoprotein (NP)-specific CD8 T-cells can control infection even when adoptively transferred to otherwise na\u00efve animals [50], [51]. These studies suggest that a robust T-cell response may reduce the threshold of antibodies needed for rapid virus clearance.\n\nIt is noteworthy that although the expression of sGP is conserved in Ebola viruses, sGP is not produced by Marburg virus (MARV), another member of the filoviridae. There are other instances where related viruses often diverge in the mechanisms they employ to survive in their respective hosts. For example, Sendai virus (SeV), a paramyxovirus that causes severe respiratory tract infections in rodents, expresses a V protein via RNA editing of the P gene. V is necessary for in vivo survival and pathogenesis of SeV, though V-deficient SeV show no defect in replication in vitro\n[52]. However, the closely related human parainfluenza virus type 1 (HPIV-1) does not express V, even though its P gene displays a high degree of homology to SeV P, and HPIV-1 causes similar disease in humans as SeV causes in rodents [53]. Similarly, while secretion of GP has not been observed in MARV, it has likely evolved alternative strategies to survive within its host.\n\nWhile the precise relevance of antigenic subversion to Ebola vaccinology remains to be determined, antigenic subversion represents a novel and elegant solution to the challenge that viruses face of balancing the ability to infect host cells efficiently while evading host immune surveillance. The constraints of a very small genome neccessitate packing a great deal of functionality into a small space, and sGP-mediated subversion represents a mechanism which, along with glycan-dependent steric shielding, and immunodominance of the GP1,2 mucin domain, may help EBOV to survive in its host. Improving our understanding of how these mechanisms work together will eventually open the door to a more rationally designed vaccine. A vaccine directed against highly conserved regions of GP1,2, such as the GP2 subunit, could induce broadly reactive antibodies while also avoiding the potential for sGP-mediated immune subversion. Such a vaccine could protect against multiple strains of EBOV, including strains that have not yet been identified.\n\nThis study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. Animal ethics approval for the immunization studies in mice was obtained from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Emory University. All animal studies were performed under approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Emory University. Female BALB/c mice (8-week old) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and housed in the animal facility at the Emory University.\n\n293T cells and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Mediatech) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, ThermoFisher) and penicillin/streptomycin. All Ebola glycoprotein constructs were based on the Ebola Zaire strain (ZEBOV), Mayinga Subtype (GenBank accession# U23187.1). Editing site mutants were generated in pBlueScript II K/S+ vector through site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange XL kit (Stratagene). Constructs were then subcloned pCAGGS mammalian expression vector. Protein expression was carried out by transfecting 90% confluent cells in 6-well plates with 5 \u00b5g DNA+12 \u00b5L Fugene HD (Roche) per well, as per manufacturer instructions, and detected at 48 h post transfection. Surface expression was detected by surface biotinylation followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-EBOV GP mouse polyclonal antibody, SDS-PAGE, and Avidin-HRP blotting. Cell lysate was harvested in cell lysis buffer and cell culture supernatant was collected, spun down to remove cell debris, and concentrated 10\u00d7 by a centrifugal concentrator. Cell lysate and concentrated cell culture supernatant were run on SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions, followed by probing with anti-EBOV GP1,2/sGP rabbit polyclonal antibody.\n\nMutant ZEBOV GP plasmids for DNA immunization experiments were prepared using the EndoFree Plasmid Mega Kit (Qiagen) as per manufacturer instructions and redissolved in pure endotoxin-free water at a concentration of 4\u20136 \u00b5g/\u00b5L, and purity was verified by restriction analysis and spectrophotometry. For immunization, DNA was diluted in sterile PBS to 0.5 \u00b5g/\u00b5L and filter sterilized. Female BALB/C mice (Charles River Laboratory) at six mice per group received 50 \u00b5g of DNA intramuscularly (25 \u00b5g/leg) per immunization. Anesthetized mice were bled retro-orbitally two weeks after each immunization and serum samples were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use.\n\nProduction of purified histidine-tagged HA has been described previously [54]. Soluble histidine-tagged GP1,2 and sGP were generated by C-terminal addition of a single 6\u00d7 histidine tag. Soluble GP1,2 was generated by truncation of the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail. Recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVV) were generated as described elsewhere to synthesize soluble His-tagged GP1,2 (His- GP1,2) and sGP (His-sGP), as well as membrane-bound GP1,2\n[55]. For production and purification of His-GP1,2 and His-sGP, rVV-infected cell supernatant was clarified and purified using a PrepEase His Purification Kit (Affymetrix) and purity of recombinant protein was verified by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot or coomassie stain. Further, purified His-GP1,2 and His-sGP were tested for reactivity to pre-immune sera or sera from unvaccinated mice by ELISA and Western blot, and they were found to be unreactive. For ELISA, flat-bottom Immulon 4-HBX 96-well plates (Thermo) were coated overnight with 0.1 \u00b5g/well of His- GP1,2 or His-sGP. A standard curve was generated by coating control wells with known concentrations of mouse IgG. Plates were washed 5\u00d7 in PBS+Tween (PBST), blocked in PBST+2%BSA, and then incubated in duplicate for two hours with antisera diluted in PBST+2%BSA. Plates were washed again, and incubated with 1\u22361000 (pooled anti- IgG subtype) HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. After final wash, plates were developed with 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Thermo) and stopped at 5 minutes with 0.2 M HCl. Plates were read and antibody concentration was calculated using the standard curve.\n\nCompetition ELISA was performed by modifying the above protocol. Plates were coated with His- GP1,2. Pooled antisera were diluted in PBST+2%BSA to a concentration corresponding to an OD of 1.0 by anti- GP1,2 ELISA. Diluted antisera were then mixed with decreasing concentrations of purified His-sGP or His- GP1,2 and immediately added to His- GP1,2-coated wells. The ELISA was then developed as described above and competition was calculated as percent of signal compared to no competing antigen.\n\nCompetition immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating pooled antisera (normalized for anti-GP1,2 titer as determined by ELISA) with 200 ng of purified His- GP1,2 and increasing amounts purified His-sGP at molar ratios of 0.25\u22361, 1\u22361, 4\u22361, and 8\u22361 sGP\u2236GP1,2. Antisera incubated with His-sGP alone, His-GP1,2 alone, or with no GP were used as controls, as well as antisera incubated with GP1,2 in the presence of recombinant influenza HA. Samples were incubated on ice for 20 minutes, followed by addition of protein-G coupled agarose beads (Thermo Scientific) to further incubate at 4\u00b0C for an additional two hr with agitation. Samples were then centrifuged and washed three times with with lysis buffer, and then mixed with 6\u00d7 Laemmli SDS sample buffer with 12% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. The samples were heated at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes and then used for SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using antibodies gainst both sGP and GP1,2.\n\nApparent affinity of polyclonal antisera was determined by quantitative ELISA using purified IgG from immunized animals. IgG was purified using Melon Gel (Thermo) as per manufacturer instructions and purity of IgG was verified by ELISA and coomassie gel staining. Since quantitative affinity ELISA requires that coating antigen be incubated with increasing dilutions of antibodies until coating antigen becomes saturated, we found that high antibody concentrations can result in signals that exceed the plate reader's range of detection. Thus, we titrated the amount of coating antigen down to 0.05 \u00b5g/well to avoid signal saturation. Wells were coated overnight with 0.05 \u00b5g of purified His-GP1,2 or His-sGP and after washing and blocking were incubated with purified IgG diluted in PBST+2%BSA, at dilutions ranging from 1\u223610 to 1\u22361280 (based on original serum volume). ELISAs were developed as described above and the signal converted to nM concentration of IgG by comparison to a standard curve. Apparent Kd's of polyclonal sera were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism. These results were verified manually by analysis of linearized binding curves as detailed elsewhere [33].\n\nEBOV-GP pseudotyped HIV was generated as described elsewhere [56]. Briefly, 293T-cells were cotransfected with Env-defective HIV backbone and ZEBOV GP in pCAGGS vector using Fugene HD (Roche). Supernatants were harvested 48 h post-transfection, clarified, and filtered using a 0.45 micron filter. Pseudoviruses were titered by infecting JC53 cells [57], which express \u03b2-galactosidase and luciferase under a tat-activated promoter, causing infected cells turning blue with X-Gal staining. Neutralization assays were performed as described elsewhere [56] with minor modifications. Briefly, pseudoviruses were pre-incubated with dilutions of heat-inactivated antisera, and supplemented with heat-inactivated na\u00efve mouse sera (Innovative Research) so that 5% of the total volume was mouse serum. Pseudovirus-antiserum mixtures were then added to 30% confluent JC53 cells and incubated for 48 h. Virus infection and neutralization was measured by luciferase reporter assay, and neutralization was measured by decrease in luciferase expression compared to virus-only controls [57].\n\nWe performed a competition neutralization assay by selecting a fixed antisera concentration corresponding to either 50% or 80% neutralizing activity. Diluted antisera were incubated with dilutions of purified His-sGP or with soluble influenza PR8 hemagluttinin (HA) as a control (GenBank Accession# JF690260). Antisera mixtures were then mixed with pseudovirus and the neutralization assay was developed as described above. Interference with neutralization was determined by the percent rescue of infectivity compared to wells with pseudovirus+antisera without competing sGP, as calculated by the formula [(virus+antibody+sGP)\u2212(virus+antibody)]/[(virus alone)\u2212(virus+antibody)]\u00d7100."}
