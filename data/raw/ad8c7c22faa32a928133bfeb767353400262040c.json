{"title": "Title: The impact of global healthcare experiences on provider practices in the United States: A qualitative study among global health physicians and program directors 2 3 Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai", "body": "Interest in the field of global health has been rapidly growing over the last decade 1-3 , as 79 has United States' (US) support for international efforts aimed at improving health in low-and 80 middle-income countries 4 . As a result, many academic medical institutions and organizations 81 have stepped up to meet this demand, offering more opportunities to study, work, and conduct More attention to patient history, increased reliance on physical exams, and greater awareness to a culture of frivolous testing Greater awareness to the social determinants of health and the limits of healthcare \"Connecting the dots\", understanding social determinants of health, recognizing similarities between healthcare access between US patients and patients abroad Rethinking the US healthcare system A more nuanced understanding of the US healthcare system through comparison with healthcare systems in other countries Values behind interest in global health Global health attracts altruistically motivated individuals. Personal values were developed prior to global health work 181 Improved patient rapport 182 All eight of the interviewed participants indicated that their global health work had 183 improved their ability to build rapport with and provide care for immigrant, refugee, and low- Improved and more engaged patient care 198 Half of participants reported that their global health work improved the quality of care 199 they were able provide to their patients back home. Participants reported this as being \"more 200 efficient\" as a result of taking better patient histories and physical exams, that they were less 201 inclined to carry out \"unnecessary and invasive tests,\" or more patient-centered 31 as they had a 202 greater awareness to patient's economic and/or cultural context. One participant reported that 203 they were \"more likely to speak to a patient about options that did not include very aggressive 204 care,\" and that they may be \"a little more comfortable\" offering to \"do nothing\" (PL #6, 205 interview). The following participant quote also exemplifies this theme: Several participants doubted whether these improvements in patient care were significant, and 213 questioned whether they could be accurately measured.\n\nReduced healthcare spending 216 The interviewees and questionnaire participants were divided on the extent to which their 217 global health work experience translated into cost savings for US patients. The majority, 218 however, reported that learning to practice medicine with fewer resources translated into more 219 reliance on patient histories, physical exams, and less on medical tests. Several also reported a 220 greater awareness of over-spending patterns in the US healthcare system -as one family 221 physician wrote: Participants who did not think that their global health work resulted in cost savings for US 230 patients expressed that they believed the differences in cost savings to be negligible. No 231 participants reported feeling that global health work resulted in more costly care for US patients 232 or the healthcare system. is an alcoholic and also that they are addicted to pain pills, and also that they are overweight.\" 243 Here global health work \"helps you connect the dots between seemingly unconnected 244 psychosocial things\" (GHP #3, interview). This participant located this thinking within the social 245 determinants of health more broadly: context of doubting the extent to which global health physicians could, themselves, improve 253 health through providing healthcare in the US or abroad. As one participant wrote, \"my 254 experience working abroad has strengthened my belief that 'well-being' (or 'health' as defined by 255 the World Health Organization) is very minimally influenced by the medical care I provide as an 256 individual physician and also minimally influenced by the medical care provided by a healthcare 257 system\" (GHP #3, questionnaire). These participants advocated for a more nuanced Participants framed these comparisons on the weaknesses of the US healthcare system by 278 discussing the motivations and standard practices of other healthcare systems. As one participant 279 noted during an interview, \"The goal of many countries' healthcare system is to serve their 280 citizens fully\u2026They start off in a different place than where we are\" (PL #7, interview).\n\nParticipants also contrasted the cultural role of healthcare in various settings. These 282 discussions were focused on perceived changes or shortcomings in US healthcare practices that 283 negatively affected patient care, as well as physician satisfaction and prestige. One participant 284 noted that they \"do not get the experience of saving lives in the US\" and \"I do not get the same 285 level of gratitude from the patients\" (GHP #3, interview). This perspective was reiterated by 286 another participant who discussed how they and other physicians \"look nostalgically to a time 287 when there was more enthusiasm for the work that physicians did\"; though, they \"try to keep the 288 dissatisfying thoughts at bay.\" This was attributed to them spending \"a lot of time doing 289 paperwork, less time doing patient interaction or [having] meaningful patient interaction\" (PL 290 #6, interview). The following participant quote exemplifies how participants framed their 291 perceptions of the US healthcare system. They perceived a decline in the US healthcare system 292 and that global health work was seen as a more personally beneficial and altruistic endeavor: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   17 broader roots of affliction), practicing \"insurance medicine\" or \"liability medicine\", or \"customer 362 service\". They attribute these perceptions to either the volunteer nature of their global health 363 work, their experiences working in non-US healthcare systems, or witnessing different provider-364 patient relationships while abroad.\n\nThe most significant division amongst participants is whether they viewed their global 366 health work as a vehicle for change on individual care, and/or systemic changes in the US. Those 367 that did report positive benefits of global health for improved patient-care and the changes to the 368 US healthcare system overall discuss these more at the individual level-such as reduced 369 spending, better patient care, and replicating interventions that had proven effective abroad. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   20   STATEMENTS   428 Acknowledgements: 429 We would like to convey our sincere appreciation to the global health physicians and program 430 leaders who took the time out of their busy schedules to participate and discuss their work.\n\nCompeting interests 433 NMT is a student at, DC and SB are faculty members at, and DC and SH are employed part-time Open's policy on competing interests and declare that we have no competing financial interests.\n\nThe authors do, however, believe strongly that healthcare is a public good, not a private 443 commodity.\n\nFunding: 446 The research study was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (grant ID: 72615).

They attributed perceived improved patient rapport to a variety of 216 reasons, such as being able to speak to patients in their own language, understand their cultural 217 background, and better understand the challenges unique to immigrant, refugee, and patients of 218 low socioeconomic position.
