{"title": "Use of Unamplified RNA/cDNA-Hybrid Nanopore Sequencing for Rapid Detection and Characterization of RNA Viruses Technical Appendix Viral Growth and RNA Isolation", "body": "SAMN04490241, internal reference IRF0137. RNA was isolated from virus preps in 1:4 supernatant: TRIzol after RNA extraction with cleanup using RNeasy MinElute cleanup kit (QIAGEN).\n\nA total of 250 ng of VEEV or EBOV RNA were either directly added to a single-strand cDNA reaction (VEEV) primed using poly-dT primers provided by Oxford Nanopore Duplications in the alignments were removed using last-map-probs (1). These methods are identical to ones used for previous work with amplicon and native nucleic acid sequencing (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) .\n\nNanopore reads were aligned against the Viral Genomes database (7) of viral reference genome sequences (data for complete genomes: Viruses (taxid 10239); 6,635 total entires, with the 2 stock genomes added from this study) and top hits and alignment statistics were generated. VEEV reads were also aligned against a database of alphavirus genome sequences (1,440 total entries; detailed below). The read files, associated data and scripts are available at GenBank EU accession numbers SAMEA3865262 (VEEV) and SAMEA3865263 (EBOV) for nanopore data and NCBI BioProject PRJNA311755 and GenBank accession no. KX000400 for the EBOV reference. Sample use of Pathosphere (8) for analysis is publically available at www.pathosphere.org under the manuscript header. One Codex analysis (9) is also publically available at https://app.onecodex.com/analysis/public/57c08743784b41d3. All reference files used for the analysis above are available as 'viralRefSeq.fa' and 'all_alphavirus_complete.fasta' attached here. Scripts are available below in addition to being hosted at www.pathosphere.org. "}
