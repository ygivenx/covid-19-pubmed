{"title": "Author manuscript; available in PMC", "body": "Influenza A and B viruses are responsible for annual epidemics and significant morbidity and mortality in the human population worldwide (Thompson et al., 2003) . Vaccination is an important intervention for preventing influenza and reducing the public health impact of epidemics and pandemics (Ambrose et al., 2011; Osterholm et al., 2012) . Global Pandemic Influenza Action Plan to increase vaccine supply was initiated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in November of 2006 and refined further in 2011. One of the objectives was to expand vaccine production capacity by building new production facilities to strengthen pandemic influenza preparedness and response. The Institute of Experimental Medicine (IEM, St Petersburg, Russia) contributed to the Global Pandemic Influenza Action Plan by establishing an agreement with the WHO to supply Russian LAIV reassortant viruses to manufacturers in developing countries who could then provide influenza vaccines to the public (Rudenko et al., 2011) . The increased international demand of Russian LAIV reassortant viruses prompted the WHO and IEM to establish a back-up facility at the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Influenza Division to prepare and incorporate quality assessment of LAIV reassortants for international use.\n\nSeasonal influenza vaccines contain two types A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) and one type B virus to elicit immunity to currently circulating influenza viruses (Fiore et al., 2009) . Two major types of influenza vaccines are licensed for human use: trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and LAIV. LAIV is administered intranasally which mimics natural infection and protects against the disease caused by the influenza viruses (Aleksandrova, 1977; Cox et al., 2004; Maassab and DeBorde, 1985) . The development of LAIV became possible with the generation of cold-adapted (ca) type A and B Master Donor Viruses (MDVs). Both MDVs have three phenotypes: (1) allow efficient viral replication at 25 \u00b0C and 33 \u00b0C (ca), (2) restrict replication at temperatures above 39 \u00b0C (temperature-sensitive, ts), and (3) do not cause classical influenza-like illness and are restricted in replication in the lower respiratory tract (attenuated, att) (Maassab and Bryant, 1999; Murphy and Coelingh, 2002; Rudenko et al., 1996) . LAIV are 6:2 reassortant viruses that contain the HA and NA gene segments from circulating influenza viruses to induce protective immune responses and the six internal gene segments (PB1, PB2, PA, NP, M, and NS) from MDVs provide ca, ts and att phenotypes of LAIV. In addition to conferring the ts and ca phenotypes, MDV also allows the reassortant viruses to replicate efficiently in embryonated chicken eggs as all licensed LAIVs are currently produced in embryonated chicken eggs.\n\nDue to constant antigenic drift of circulating influenza viruses, the individual strains of the vaccine are updated annually based on WHO recommendations. A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like and B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like viruses were recommended by the WHO for vaccine use in the 2012-2013 influenza season. Classical reassortment methods were used to produce vaccine candidate viruses by co-infection of A/Victoria/361/2011 and MDV-A A/ Leningrad/134/17/57 (H2N2) or B/Texas/06/2011 and MDV-B B/USSR/60/69 followed by genotyping a number of virus progeny for selection of the 6:2 reassortants. To enhance the genetic homogeneity, virus cloning by serial limiting dilution in eggs was performed.\n\nSensitive control of reassortant genetic composition is necessary to provide evidence that there are no contaminating wild type (wt) viruses present that may replicate efficiently in patients and cause illness and to assure that the vaccine strain does not contain HA and NA from MDVs. A challenge for the limiting dilution cloning in eggs method is the possibility of obtaining an impure vaccine candidate. According to WHO guidelines for generation and characterization of LAIV candidates, biological materials for vaccine production, such as seed viruses and intermediates should be fully and up-to-date characterized to assure the quality, safety, and efficacy of LAIV for intranasal administration (WHO, 2009 ). The safety concerns necessitate accurate, sensitive and reliable methods to characterize the quality of LAIV seed candidates generated by classical reassortment. The current techniques for identity/homogeneity testing of reassortant influenza vaccines are the ones used for genotyping -analysis of restriction fragment length polymorphism of viral genes amplified by RT-PCR (Fulvini et al., 2011; Klimov and Cox, 1995; Sakamoto et al., 1996) , multiplex RT-PCR (Ha et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2010) and Sanger sequencing -all are based on conventional RT-PCR method. In an attempt to provide better quality control of LAIV candidate viruses and to ensure the uniform composition of the A/Victoria/ 361/2011(H3N2)-CDC-LV1 (LV1) and B/Texas/06/2011-CDC-LV2B (LV2B) reassortants (designated as Master Virus Seed, MVS), real-time RT-PCR assays were developed to confirm the lack of any genetic material of undesired origin in the reassortant viruses.\n\nEgg adapted wt influenza virus strains A/Victoria/361/2011 (passage history in eggs -E3/E2, where E#/means number of egg passages in submission laboratory and/E# means number of egg passages in CDC) and B/Texas/06/2011 (E4) were obtained from CDC repository. The clones of cold-adapted MDV-A A/Leningrad/134/17/57(H2N2), and MDV-B B/USSR/60/69 were obtained at the IEM, St Petersburg, Russia. MDV stocks were prepared in 10-day-old SPF eggs (Charles River Laboratories Inc., Wilmington, MA) and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C. Infectious titer of wt and MDVs were measured by 50% egg infectious dose per milliliter (EID 50 /ml) as previously described (Huprikar and Rabinowitz, 1980) . Briefly, 10-fold serial dilutions of allantoic fluid were made in PBS (137 mM NaCl, 10 mM phosphate, 2.7 mM KCl, pH of 7.4) and 0.2 ml of each dilution was inoculated into 10-dayold SPF eggs. Five eggs were infected with each virus dilution and incubated at 32 \u00b0C for 48 h for influenza A virus and 72 h for influenza B virus. Harvested allantoic fluids were tested for HA activity using 0.5% turkey red blood cells (tRBC). The virus titer was calculated using Reed and Muench method (Reed and Muench, 1938) .\n\nReassortant influenza viruses that possess the internal genes of MDV-A or MDV-B and the surface genes of A/Victoria/361/2011 or B/Texas/06/2011, respectively, were prepared according to a method developed by the IEM, St Petersburg, Russia (Aleksandrova, 1977; Wareing et al., 2002) . Briefly, equal doses (~10 6 EID 50 ) of the donor and wt strains were inoculated into 10-day-old SPF eggs and incubated at 32 \u00b0C for 2 (influenza A) or 3 (influenza B) days. HA-positive allantoic fluids were combined and diluted 1:10 with antiserum prepared against the MDV-A in ferrets and against MDV-B in rabbits (provided by IEM, St Petersburg, Russia, through WHO). The virus-serum mixtures were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C and then passaged once in SPF eggs at 25 \u00b0C for 6 days. If needed, a blind passage at 32 \u00b0C was performed. All HA-positive allantoic fluids were combined. A second selective passage of HA-positive allantoic fluids was then carried out in the presence of antiserum at 25 \u00b0C followed by cloning procedures (Wareing et al., 2002) .\n\nRNA was isolated from influenza virus-containing allantoic fluids and purified on the MagnaPure LC (Roche, San Francisco, CA) using the MagNA Pure Total Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche, San Francisco, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Clarified allantoic fluid of infected eggs (200 \u03bcL) was used for RNA isolation. RNAs were eluted in a final volume of 50 \u03bcL of RNase-free water.\n\nGenome composition of reassortant influenza viruses was assessed by standard hemagglutination inhibition assay (for HA) and pyrosequencing analysis (for NA and the other six genes) (Deng et al., 2011) .\n\nStrain-specific and segment-specific primers/probe sets for rRT-PCR were designed for genes of A/Leningrad/134/17/57 (Table 1) , A/Victoria/361/2011 (Table 2) , B/Texas/06/2011 (Table 3 ) and B/USSR/60/69 using GenScript Real-time PCR TaqMan Primer Design (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) and PrimerExpress 3.0 Software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Primers/probe sets for B/USSR/60/69 are not provided for the reasons of intellectual property rights associated with this master donor virus. Primers/probe sets for universal detection of H3 and H2 subtypes, and specific detection of PB1 gene of LAIV-A (FluMist) were provided by Diagnostic Development Team, VSDB, Influenza Division, CDC (primer and probes available upon request). The rRT-PCR was performed using SuperScript \u00ae III Platinum \u00ae One-Step quantitative RT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) on Mx3000P thermal cycler (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The reaction was conducted in a total volume of 25 \u03bcl containing 0.8 \u03bcM of each primer and 0.2 \u03bcM of probe and 5 \u03bcl of viral RNA. Reaction conditions were as follows: one cycle of 50 \u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 2 min at 95 \u00b0C, and 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 1 min at 60 \u00b0C. The data were analyzed using MxPro QPCR Software.\n\nRNAs were extracted from viruses in allantoic fluid with known infectious titer. Serial 10fold dilutions were prepared in RNase-free water. Standard curves were generated with duplicate samples over a template dilution range of 6 logs by using obtained cycle threshold (C t ) with a difference between replicates of < 0.5 C t values. The resulting C t values for each dilution were plotted versus virus EID 50 . The linear regression analysis was applied to determine the slopes. By using obtained C t values the amplification efficiencies were calculated as E = (10 (\u22121/slope) \u2212 1) \u00d7 100.\n\nReassortant MVS (Master Virus Seed) stocks were tested for genome stability and the absence of contamination by wt viruses after five consecutive passages in SPF eggs . Briefly, vaccine candidate viruses were diluted with PBS to the final virus concentration of 5 \u00d7 10 5 EID 50 /ml and three 10-day-old SPF eggs were inoculated with 0.2 ml of the diluted virus. The eggs were incubated for 48 h (influenza A) or 72 h (influenza B) at 32 \u00b0C, then were chilled (4 \u00b0C 3 h to overnight) and allantoic fluids from each egg were harvested and pooled together. The virus titer was estimated in HA assay using 0.5% tRBC. The average ratio between number of influenza virus particles and HA units has been reported to be 10 7 particles/HA per mL with the deviation about 8%, depending of virus strains and type of RBC (Desselberger, 1975; Donald and Isaacs, 1954; Isaacs, 1957; Tyrrell and Valentine, 1957) . Thus, allantoic fluid with 500 HA titer is estimated to contain about 5 \u00d7 10 9 virus particles per mL. Approximately ten virus particles correspond to one EID 50 /mL (Donald and Isaacs, 1954) . The infectivity of allantoic fluid with 500 HA unit would correspond to about 5 \u00d7 10 8 EID 50 /mL. To keep the same level of multiplicity of infection in the following passages, the allantoic fluid with HA titer of 500 were diluted 1000 times with PBS to final 5 \u00d7 10 5 EID 50 /mL and SPF eggs were inoculated with 0.2 mL/egg. After the 5th passage in eggs, allantoic fluids were collected and clarified by low speed centrifugation at 300 \u00d7 g for 10 min and used for further analysis.\n\nThe complete viral cDNAs for each segment (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M and NS) of the cloned viruses were synthesized from purified viral RNA using AccessQuick RT-PCR system (Promega, Madison, USA). Viral genome fragments (eight for PB2, PB1 and PA, six for HA, five for NP and NA, and three for M and NS) were amplified using overlapping M13 tagged gene segment specific primers. RT-PCR products were resolved by the 2% E-Gel 96 agarose electrophoresis system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and were purified by ExoSAP-IT system (Affymetrix/USB, Cleveland, OH). Sanger sequencing of the cDNA was performed with the M13 primers using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The sequencing extension products were purified using the Agencourt CleanSEQ (Agencourt/Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) and analyzed using an ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and 3730 Data Collection v3.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Trace files were assembled in Sequencer (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI). BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor (Thomas Hall/Ibis Biosciences, Carlsbad, CA) software was used to align consensus sequences of gene segments with the corresponding sequences of MDV-A and wt A/ Victoria/361/2011 or MDV-B and wt B/Texas/06/2011 viruses.\n\nFor each wt-MDV pair used to create reassortants, primers/probe sets for rRT-PCR were designed to match the genome of only one of the virus strain of the pair (Tables 1-3) . To verify the specificity of the primer sets, viral RNAs were isolated and purified from 10 7 EID 50 /mL wt and MDV viruses, and used for rRT-PCR reaction. Each virus RNA (MDV and wt) was tested by rRT-PCR with all primers/probe sets designed for that pair. These primers amplified only a specific product. None of the cross-templates resulted in a positive signal, confirming that the designed primers/probe sets were strain and segment specific. The examples of test amplification curves are shown in Fig. 1. The sensitivity was determined for each rRT-PCR primers/probe set for the detection of the undesired genetic materials in the prepared clonal MVS stocks. The amplification efficiency between 90% and 110% means doubling of the amplicon at each cycle. This corresponds to a slope of standard curve \u22123.1 to \u22123.6. Standard curves obtained showed that designed assays had amplification efficiency in 90-110% range and R 2 values were 0.98-0.99 (Fig.  2) .\n\nThe limit of detection was determined as the lowest concentration at which positive signal was obtained (Table 4 ). The limit of detection of rRT-PCR using primer/probe sets for A/ Victoria/361/2011 PA and PB2 was at 0.08 EID 50 per reaction, followed by 0.8 EID 50 for PB1, NP, M and NS, and 1.3 EID 50 for MDV-A HA and NA. In the case of influenza B strains, B/Texas/06/2011 PB2, PB1, PA, and NS primer/probe sets were most sensitive at 0.1 EID 50 /reaction followed by 1 EID 50 for NP and M. LoD for MDV-B HA NA genes were 1 EID 50/ per reaction.\n\nUsing the highly specific and sensitive rRT-PCR protocol as described above, the genetic homogeneity of reassortant viruses, LV1 and LV2B, were analyzed using RNA corresponding to 10 5 EID 50 /per reaction. MDV and wt viruses were also tested as controls. For both reassortants, the positive signals were detected only with primers/probe specific for internal genes of MDV and HA and NA genes of wt (A/Victoria/361/2011 for LV1 and B/ Texas/06/2011 for LV2B). No undesired genes were detected in the reassortant viruses with a high sensitivity level of detection (Table 5 ). The data showed that the A/Victoria The genome sequence analysis of LV1 and LV2B was completed by alignment of the six internal protein gene segments (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, and NS) with those of corresponding MDVs and the two surface antigen segments, HA and NA, with the corresponding RNA segments of the wt A/Victoria/361/2011 or B/Texas/06/2011. The rRT-PCR analysis was consistent with the full genome sequence analysis. The alignment of sequences for the six internal gene segments of LV1 detected no nucleotide changes. LV2B contained only one nucleotide change in the NP gene segment (T66C) that did not result in amino acid substitution. No other mutations in the remaining internal gene segments were identified. The HA and NA sequences of LV1 were identical to one of the egg adapted A/Victoria/ 361/2011. The HA sequence of wt B/Texas/06/2011, E4 isolate, which was used for reassortment, was shown to have a mix at position 596 (A or C) compared to E3 isolate which had 596A. The A596C change led to amino acid Q200P substitution, since this mutation appeared during passage of virus in eggs it constitutes an egg adapted change. LV2B HA gene had 596C indicating the presence of 200P. NA sequence was identical to the NA of wt virus.\n\nTo test the genetic stability, LAIV reassortant viruses, LV1 and LV2B were subjected to five passages in SPF eggs. The infectious titers of original LAIV reassortants were 10 9.3 and 10 9.2 EID 50 /mL for LV1 and LV2B, respectively. Passages were done with 0.2 ml of a 10 \u22123 dilution of the virus which corresponds to approximately 10 5 EID 50 of virus per egg. RNA purified from five time passaged viruses was subjected to rRT-PCR procedure to confirm the homogeneity of the virus. No signal was detected in the reactions with RNA from the passaged LV1 reassortant when Victoria PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M, NS, or MDV-A NA and HA primers/probe sets were used. Similarly, no signal was detected with LV2B RNA when Texas internal genes and MDV-B NA and HA primers/probe sets were used, confirming again that the obtained reassortants were genetically homogeneous and did not contained genetic material of undesired origin.\n\nThe LV1 and LV2B viruses passaged five times in eggs were also characterized by complete full genome sequencing. Sequence alignments of all gene segments of the passaged virus with corresponding sequences of the original LV1 or LV2B did not reveal any nucleotide differences between them, indicating the genetic stability of the LAIV reassortant genome.\n\nTests to characterize the quality of live attenuated influenza vaccine viruses are being continuously developed and improved (Buonagurio et al., 2006; Yeolekar and Dhere, 2012) . The WHO recently updated recommendations to provide vaccine manufacturers and national regulatory authorities with guidance in developing specific processes to assure the quality, safety, and efficacy of live attenuated influenza vaccines for intranasal administration (WHO, 2009) . The testing guidelines for the infectivity (potency), identity, sterility and stability of vaccine were outlined in this document. According to the guideline, LAIV candidates should be characterized by an identity test during their preparation. The identity test should include appropriate methods to identify the HA and NA antigens and to obtain phenotypic and genetic information for the vaccine viruses (WHO, 2009) . Genotypic characterization of a vaccine virus should include its complete sequence, and may include analysis of viral subpopulations and its genetic stability. The stability of the genotype and phenotype should also be demonstrated following viral passages beyond the level used in vaccine production (WHO, 2009) . In this study, the real-time RT-PCR assays were developed for both type A and type B LAIV reassortants, and its sensitivity was tested in an attempt to provide better identity and stability testing for quality control of LAIV candidate viruses.\n\nLAIV candidates for the 2012-2013 seasons, A/Victoria/361/2011-CDC-LV1 (LV1) and B/ Texas/06/2011-CDC-LV2B (LV2B) were created by the classical viral reassortment method. The genetic identity of vaccine candidate viruses was demonstrated by pyrosequencing assay at the stage of vaccine candidate selection. The pyrosequencing approach as well as most of the other current techniques used for genotyping and screening of reassortant influenza viruses are based on conventional RT-PCR technique (Fulvini et al., 2011; Ha et al., 2006; Kiseleva et al., 2011; Klimov and Cox, 1995; Lee et al., 2010; Sakamoto et al., 1996) . The sensitivity of the RT-PCR was shown to be at least log 10 lower compared to rRT-PCR technique in a number of reports (Chen et al., 2007; Emery et al., 2004; Kaida et al., 2008; Rodrigues et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2007) . For example, the rRT-PCR H5 gene assay designed for avian influenza reproducibly determined lowest amount of viral RNA corresponding 0.05 EID 50 per reaction in contrast to detection limit of 3 EID 50 in cnRT-PCR (Chen et al., 2007) . Real time RT-PCR is currently recognized as the most sensitive and reliable technique for detection and identification of viral subpopulations in diagnostics. The highest sensitivity of rRT-PCR assays was demonstrated for the detection of influenza viruses of different origin and composition (Chen et al., 2007; Monne et al., 2008; Nakauchi et al., 2011; Shu et al., 2011) . The rRT-PCR assays reported for detection of subtype H5, H7, and H9 avian influenza viruses had sensitivity from 0.5 to 2.74 EID 50 /per reaction (Monne et al., 2008) . The sensitivity of rRT-PCR assays developed in the present study was shown to range from 0.08 to 0.8 EID 50 per reaction for the detection of undesired genes in LV1 and from 0.1 to 1 EID 50 /reaction for the detection of undesired genes in LV2B. Therefore, primer/probe sets used in the current study allowed genome detection as sensitive as those reported in other studies using rRT-PCR assays (Chen et al., 2007; Monne et al., 2008; Spackman et al., 2002; Wise et al., 2004) . However, it should be noted that although the designed primers and probes for MDVs are expected to work for the next MDV-wt reassortment pairs, the primer and probes sequences for next selected for vaccine wt virus must be checked and updated regularly and the limit of detection should be identified using that specific wt RNA.\n\nDuring the vaccine manufacturing process, MVS undergoes three to four additional passages before blending the monovalent pool to formulate LAIV (Buonagurio et al., 2006; WHO, 2009) . It is important to determine that no other genetic material is present in the MVS which could be assured by rRT-PCR homogeneity test. In the present study, the homogeneity of the original and passaged LV1 and LV2B viruses were analyzed by rRT-PCR and genetic stability was confirmed by complete sequencing of all gene segments. The rRT-PCR data demonstrate that neither of the reassortant viruses contained genetic material from internal genes of wt parental viruses or HA and NA genes of MDV origin with a high sensitivity levels of assays (Table 5 ). The rRT-PCR results were confirmed by sequencing analysis. No nucleotide change was found in sequences of passaged five times LV1 or LV2B viruses indicating the high level of genetic stability. The data obtained in the present study are in good agreement with the previous study on genetic stability of FluMist/CAIV-T vaccine, which demonstrated a remarkable sequence identity for all vaccine intermediates throughout the manufacturing process (Buonagurio et al., 2006) The fact that no undesired genes were detected after five passages of MVS by rRT-PCR proves that the developed rRT-PCR assays were adequate and sufficient to provide the evidence for the homogeneity of the prepared vaccine candidate. In conclusion, both rRT-PCR and sequencing results provide conclusive safety controls for further manufacturing processing of MVS. The real-time RT-PCR assays developed in the present study are in compliance with WHO recommendations to provide further quality control steps to ensure safe use of LAIV.
