{"title": "Flavonoid-mediated inhibition of SARS coronavirus 3C-like protease expressed in Pichia pastoris", "body": "In 2002, the first reported outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in Guangdong province, China. It rapidly spread to over 32 countries in Asia, North America, and Europe. The mortality rate was approximately 10%, according to World Health Organization data. The causative agent of SARS is a novel human coronavirus (CoV), designated SARS-CoV. An efficient therapy and a vaccine are not currently available (Xu et al. 2005) . SARS-CoV is an enveloped positive single-stranded RNA virus (Rota et al. 2003 ) that encodes two proteases for proteolytic processing: a papain-like cysteine protease (PLP2 pro ) and a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3C-like protease; 3CL pro ) located in the non-structural protein regions nsp3 and nsp5, respectively. Since 3CL pro is essential for the viral life cycle, it is an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs directed against SARS-CoV and other CoV infections (Grum-Tokars et al. 2008) .\n\nFlavonoids are a large group of naturally occurring phenolic compounds ubiquitously distributed in the plant kingdom. Over 4,000 varieties of flavonoids have been identified (de Groot and Rauen 1998) . Flavonoids can act as potent antioxidants, and display anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, antihemorrhagic, antimutagenic, antineoplastic, and hepatoprotective activities (Tapas et al. 2008; de Groot and Rauen 1998) . In addition, flavonoids inhibit the catalytic activities of a great variety of enzymes, including hexokinase, phospholipase C, protein kinase C, a-glucosidase, and a-amylase. (Tadera et al. 2006) . Some flavonoid compounds such as quercetin, quercetin derivatives, catechin, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate and epigallocatechin gallate inhibit SARS-3CL pro expressed in Escherichia coli (Chen et al. 2005 (Chen et al. , 2006 Yi et al. 2004 ). However, there has been no report on the high inhibition activity of gallocatechin gallate (GCG) against SARS-3CL pro , or the structureactivity relationship activity among the aforementioned flavonoid compounds.\n\nHerein, we report on the expression of SARS-3CL pro in Pichia pastoris GS115, its' in vitro inhibition by seven flavonoid compounds belonging to four groups of flavonoids (flavonol, flavanonol, isoflavone, and flavan-3-ol), and the structure-activity relationship between them. The detailed mechanism of GCG inhibition was investigated by enzyme kinetic and molecular docking studies.\n\nThe procedures for construction, transformation, and screening for the catalytic domain of SARS 3CL pro were according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The gene encoding SARS 3CL pro polyprotein (amino acid residues 3,241-3,546, GenBank accession no. AY274119) (Benson et al. 2011) was optimized by replacing rare codons with high-frequency codons, which were selected on the basis of the findings for codons usage in Pichia pastoris ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ), and were synthesized and cloned in the pUC57 vector (pUC57-3CL) by a custom gene synthesis service (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The 3CL pro gene was isolated from the vector pUC57-3CL by cutting with EcoRI and NotI, and was subcloned into the EcoRI/NotI restriction sites of the expression vector pPICZaA. The novel construct was named pPICZaA-3CL pro and transformed into E. coli DH5a (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) using a standard heat shock method. Transformants harbouring pPICZaA-3CL pro were selected from LB agar low salt medium [1% (w/v) Tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, pH 7.5] containing 25 lg Zeocin ml -1 (Invitrogen). Plasmid pPICZaA-3CL pro was amplified in E. coli DH5a, linearized by SacI digestion, and transformed into P. pastoris GS115 by a modified LiCl method. pPICZaA vector was also linearized by SacI digestion and transformed into P. pastoris GS115 as a negative control strain. Screening for positive clones was done by PCR with two sets of primers (Bioneer, Deajeon, Korea): set one contained 3CL pro primers [3CL-F (5 0 -GTGGATTCAGAAAAATGGCC-3 0 ) and 3CL-R (5 0 -CCGCCTGAAAAGTAACTCCT-3 0 )] and set two contained a-factor and 3AOX1 primers. The PCR conditions were 94\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 53\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and a final step of 72\u00b0C for 5 min. PCR was conducted using PCRmix and the PCR product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.\n\nRecombinant 3CL pro was expressed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Largescale expression of 3CL pro was carried out in a 10 l fermenter with 4 l BMMY medium. The fermentation conditions were 28\u00b0C, pH 6.0, 350 rpm, and aeration at 1 vvm. Methanol was added as described above.\n\nProtein expression by pPICZaA transformed into P. pastoris GS115 was included as a negative control. The yeast was separated from the broth by centrifugation at 8,0009g for 15 min. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant was exchanged by 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) using a Millipore membrane. The supernatant was used for ammonium sulphate fractionation (from 0 to 85%). The obtained proteins were dissolved in 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5). The detection of recombinant 3CL pro in the culture supernatant was by 12% SDS-PAGE and western blot of the electrotransferred proteins according to to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). Activity of the recombinant enzyme was detected as described below.\n\nThe proteolytic activity of 3CL pro was measured using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay with a substrate labeled with 5-[(2 0 -aminoethyl)-amino]naphthelenesulfonic acid (Edans) and 4-[{4-(dimehtylamino)phenyl}azo]benzoic acid (Dabcyl) as the energy transfer pair (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland). The Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans fluorogenic peptide was used as the substrate and the enhanced fluorescence due to cleavage of this substrate catalyzed by the protease was monitored at 538 nm with an excitation wavelength of 355 nm using a fluorescence plate reader. The reaction mixture contained 3 lg 3CL pro protease and 20 lM fluorogenic substrate in 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) (Grum-Tokars et al. 2008 ). The plates were analyzed at 25\u00b0C with continuous monitoring of fluorescence for 25 min, with recording of relative fluorescence units (RFUs) using a Spectra-Max Gemini XPS apparatus (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with excitation and fluorescence emission wavelengths of 355 and 538 nm, respectively. Kinetic parameters of recombinant 3CL pro were obtained using 12.5-100 lM FRET peptides in the fluorescent assay with an 18 min measurement period. Reaction responses were linear within this time. The (K m ) value was calculated from a Lineweaver-Burk using the SigmaPlot program (Systat Software, San Diego, CA, USA).\n\nQuercetin, daidzein, puerarin, epigallocatechin (EGC), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and gallocatechin gallate (GCG) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and ampelopsin (AMPLS) was purchased from ZR chemicals (Shanghai, China). Primarily inhibitory activities of flavonoid compounds were determined by measuring the remaining activity of 3CL pro at 200 lM inhibitors. GCG, EGCG, and EGC were dissolved in water; quercetin, puerarin, daidzein, and AMPLS were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as 10 mM stock solutions. The enzyme reaction digest (100 ll) was composed of 3 lg enzyme, 20 lM FRET substrate, 200 lM of each flavonoid compound, and 20 mM Tris/ HCl buffer (pH 7.5). Reactions were run for 18 min at 25\u00b0C with continuous monitoring of fluorescence. The inhibition was calculated using following formula (1): % inhibition = 100 -remaining activity (%) where the remaining activity (1), where C is the fluorescence of the control (enzyme, buffer, and substrate) after 18 min incubation, C o is the fluorescence of the control at time zero, S is the fluorescence of the tested samples (enzyme, tested sample solution, buffer and substrate) after 18 min incubation, and S o is the fluorescence of the tested samples at time zero. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) was defined as the concentration of 3CL pro inhibitor necessary to reduce 3CL pro activity by 50% relative to a reaction mixture containing 3CL pro enzyme but no inhibitor. Inhibitor kinetic studies were performed for GCG, which was the best inhibitor against 3CL pro . The method was similar to those used in a kinetic study of the recombinant enzyme, except for the use of multiple concentrations of the inhibitor (0-60 lM) and variable concentrations of substrate (5-15 lM). The type of inhibition was determined using Lineweaver-Burk plots and a Dixon plot (1/v as a function of inhibitor concentration, [I]) and kinetic parameters (K i ) was calculated using the SigmaPlot program.\n\nThe three-dimensional structure of 3CL pro was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (Lee et al. 2009 ). All water molecules, co-crystal ligand ZU5 were removed and the structure information containing only the amino acid residues of the 3CL pro enzyme was used for docking. Docking files were prepared using AutoDock-Tools software (Sanner et al. 1996) . For the protein molecules, polar hydrogen atoms were added and nonpolar hydrogen atoms were merged. Kollman charges and solvation parameters were assigned by default. The threedimensional atomic coordinates of GCG were generated by the Corina program (Molecular Networks GmbH, Erlangen, Germany), Gasteiger charges were added and nonpolar hydrogen atoms were merged. The grid box, with grid spacing of 0.375 \u00c5 and dimensions of 60 9 60 9 60 points along the x, y, and z axes, was centered on the macromolecule. AutoDock version 3.0.5 software using the Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) was used for the computational molecular docking simulation of flexible small molecules to rigid proteins with ligand and rigid proteins (Morris et al. 1998 ). Important docking parameters for the Lamarckian genetic algorithm were a population size of 250 individuals, maximum of 5 million energy evaluations, maximum of 27,000 generations, mutation rate of 0.02, crossover rate of 0.80, and 100 docking runs (each docking job produced 100 docked conformations). The probability of performing a local search on an individual in the population was set to 0.06 and the maximum number of iterations per local search was set to 300. The conformation with the lowest docked energy was chosen from the most populated cluster and was put through to the next stage. The hydrogen bond (Hbond) interaction between 3CL pro and GCG was identified by Ligplot software (Wallace et al. 1995) .\n\nThe 918 bp gene encoding 3CL pro (amino acids 3,241-3,546) from human SARS-CoV was cloned into the pPICZaA expression vector (pPICZaA-3CL pro ) and the pPICZaA-3CL pro plasmid was linearized by SacI digestion that was further incorporated into the AOX1 locus of Pichia pastoris. Seven colonies were identified as 3CL pro -positive by PCR (Supplementary Fig 2) . A single clone was selected for expression; the recombinant 3CL pro was resolved electrophoretically as a band of approx. 42 kDa. To confirm that the clone secreted 3CL pro , western blotting was performed using the anti-His antibody; 3CL pro was apparent as the same band upon SDS-PAGE and the control did not show this band on Western blot (Supplementary Fig 3) .\n\nLarge-scale expression of 3CL pro was carried out in a 10 l fermenter with 4 l BMMY medium. 3CL pro was secreted and the amount of 3CL pro protein was increased as the induction time increased (Fig. 1a) as confirmed by western blot analysis (Fig. 1b) . After 4 days induction, the RFU (as representative of enzyme activity) was increased 2.4-times compared with 3 days induction. Electrophoretic analysis of the 3CL pro fraction obtained using ammonium sulfate gave 80% purity (Supplementary Fig 4) . The yields of each step in the procedure are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 . No appreciable glycosylation was observed for 3CL pro even after endoglycosidase H treatment.\n\nTo calculate the kinetic parameters of the purified 3CL pro , enzyme activity was analyzed with fluorescent substrate from 12.5 to 100 lM. The Km value was 15 \u00b1 1 lM (Supplementary Fig 5) . The K m value of the purified 3CL pro was similar to the K m value of 3CL pro expressed in E. coli (K m of 17 \u00b1 4 lM) (Kuo et al. 2004 ).\n\nSeven flavonoid compounds belonging to four groups of flavonoids (flavonol, flavanonol, isoflavone, and flavan-3-ol) (Fig. 2) were evaluated for their inhibitory activity against 3CL pro expressed from P. pastoris GS115. Table 1 shows the inhibitory activity of each flavonoid against the 3CL pro at 200 lM. Quercetin, EGCG and GCG inhibited more than 80% of the activity of recombinant 3CL pro ; AMPLS, puerarin, and daidzein inhibited more than 30% activity of recombinant 3CL pro ; and EGC inhibited only 5% of the activity of recombinant 3CL pro . Six compounds displayed an IC 50 ranging from 47 to 381 lM (Table 1) . GCG showed the best inhibition against recombinant 3CL pro with IC 50 value of 47 \u00b1 0.9 lM, and so was used for the further analysis of inhibition mode. Both Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots were used. As shown in Fig. 3a , GCG exhibited competitive inhibition toward 3CL pro because the Lineweaver-Burk plot of 1/v versus 1/[S] resulted in a family of straight lines with the same y-axis intercept. The K i value of GCG was determined to be 25 \u00b1 1.7 lM from the common x-axis intercept of lines on the corresponding Dixon plot (Fig. 3b) .\n\nIn order to get a better comprehension of the molecular recognition process between 3CL pro and antioxidant compounds, docking experiments were performed using the crystal structure of 3CL pro (2ZU5). Autodock 3.0.5 was used to carry out docking simulations. The free binding energy of flavonoid compounds is shown in Table 1 . Among them, GCG displayed the lowest free binding energy (-14 kcal mol -1 ). The binding between GCG and active site pocket of 3CL pro is shown in Fig. 4a . To elucidate the interaction of 3CL pro with GCG, the potential hydrophobic and H-bond interactions between amino acid residues in the active site pockets of 3CLpro and GCG were investigated using the Ligplot program. Figure 4b depicts the details of the specific interactions between GCG and 3CL pro . Carbon atoms of GCG interacted hydrophobically with His41, Cys145, Met165, Glu166, Asp187, Arg188, and Gln189 of 3CL pro . GCG formed seven hydrogen bonds with residues in the catalytic binding pocket of 3CL pro . The \n\nIn this study, we compared the inhibition activity of AMPLS, EGC, EGCG, and GCG containing the same (Table 1 ). The decreasing order of the inhibitory activity was EGC \\ AMPLS \\ EGCG \\ GCG. EGCG and GCG have a galloyl moiety at the 3-OH position, which is absent in the other catechins used in this study. EGCG and GCG displayed stronger 3CL pro inhibitory activity than those of EGC and AMPLS. GCG (2S, 3R type), which is a C-2 epimeric isomer of EGCG (2R, 3R type), showed 1.5-times higher 3CL pro inhibitory activity than that of EGCG. Molecular docking simulation was used to calculate the binding of GCG to the 3CL pro active site. GCG bound at the substrate-binding pocket of 3CL pro with numerous hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions. The galloyl group from GCG was important for GCG binding to 3CL pro active site pocket because it has four hydrogen bond interactions with Leu141, Gly143, Ser144, and His163 (Fig. 4b) .\n\nThe effect of B-ring and hydroxyl group substitution on the B-ring for the inhibitory activity was evaluated. Daidzein and puerarin, which lack the B-ring, showed little inhibition of 3CL pro . The 3CL pro inhibitory activity of AMLSP was 4.96-times lower than that of quercetin. This confirmed that the addition of an OH group at 5 0 -position of the B ring decreased the 3CL pro inhibitory activity. The effect of the structures of the A and C rings on the inhibitory activity was evaluated. Since AMPLS, which lacks the 2,3-double bonds in the C-ring, showed lower inhibitory activity than that of quercetin, 2,3-double bonds are probably crucially influential to the inhibitory activity. EGC lacking the C(4)=O in the C-ring, C(2)=C(3), containing 5 0 -OH group and lacking galloyl moiety showed the lowest inhibitory activity compared to that of AMPLS, daidzein, puerarin, quercetin, EGCG, or GCG.\n\nAn important goal of the present study was to understand the inhibition by seven flavonoid compounds belonging to four groups of flavonoids (flavonol, flavanonol, isoflavone, and flavan-3-ol) against 3CL pro of SARS-CoV. The active extracellular 3CL pro was successfully expressed and purified in P. pastoris GS115. Among the investigated flavonoids, GCG was the best inhibitor against 3CL pro by an in vitro assay. The structure and inhibition activity relationship among seven flavonoid compounds was also investigated. GCG showed numerous hydrophobic and H-bonds interaction with amino acid residues in the active site pocket of 3CL pro ."}
