{"title": "World Health Organization Methodology to Prioritize Emerging Infectious Diseases in Need of Research and Development Technical Appendix 5 Multicriteria Scores Calculation and Detailed Discordance Estimation Procedure 1. Multicriteria Scores Calculation Subcriteria Weights", "body": "The criteria weights were calculated following the standard AHP procedure. The subcriteria were considered at equal importance, hence the weight of subcriteria f was equal to the weight of the corresponding criteria divided by its number of subcriteria. These weights were gathered in the weighting vector Wsub.\n\nThe disease scores were calculated by using the normalization procedure of the AHP as Once these comparison matrices were built for each expert, they were averaged to the comparison matrices Af. According to Saaty, the geometric mean should be used when aggregating people's opinions (1): \"Two important issues in group decision making are: how to aggregate individual judgements in a group into a single representative judgement for the entire group and how to construct a group choice from individual choices. The reciprocal property plays an important role in combining the judgements of several individuals to obtain a single judgement for the group. Judgements must be combined so that the reciprocal of the synthesized judgements is equal to the syntheses of the reciprocals of these judgements. It has been proved that the geometric mean, not the frequently used arithmetic mean, is the only way to do that.\"\n\nFor this methodology, the arithmetic average was also used to compare the results and to estimate the confidence on the final ranking. For this purpose, the data were processed in a different way. First, when the expert answers \"I do not know\" to any of the subcriteria statements defi was set equal to NA then the data were arithmetically averaged to the vector df. If dfi was equal to NA, it was set to 0. The comparison matrices were then built by using equation 1.\n\nAfter the averaging step, if some elements of matrix Af, afij, remained equal to NA, this meant that for the disease i or j the information was not known among the Prioritization Committee. Accordingly, we considered these diseases of equal importance for the sub-criterion The higher the CI, the more incoherent the comparison and the weighting were. Thomas L. Saaty introduced by experimentation a coherence ratio CR, equation 8, to give a reference for the coherence analysis. If CR was higher than 10% then the comparison and the weighting were not consistent.\n\nWhere RI is the random inconsistency index of a matrix of order n. This analysis can be explained as the level of random comparisons in matrix Af. If CR is low, then matrix Af was filled logically through a scale and rational analysis. If CR was high, then matrix Af was filled randomly.\n\nThe final step of this process was to compute the multicriteria scores to rank the diseases.\n\nThese Where M was the multicriteria score vector. This vector ranked the diseases according to their level of priority given the eight prioritization criteria. The disease with the highest score was the one with the highest priority. The disease with the lowest score was the one with lowest priority.\n\nLet \u03a3Df be the vector of standard deviation of the vector Df, \uf053 = (\n\nLet \u03a3Af be the matrix of standard deviation of the matrix Af.
