{"title": "Marine pharmacology in 2007-8: Marine compounds with antibacterial, anticoagulant, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, antiprotozoal, antituberculosis, and antiviral activities; affecting the immune and nervous system, and other miscellaneous mechanisms of action", "body": "The current article presents the preclinical pharmacology of marine natural products during 2007-8 maintaining the format used in the previous reviews (Mayer and Lehmann, 2000; Mayer and Hamann, 2002 , 2005 Mayer et al., 2007 Mayer et al., , 2009 . The preclinical pharmacology of antitumor and cytotoxic marine compounds has been reported in separate reviews (Mayer, 1999; Mayer and Lehmann, 2001; Mayer and Gustafson, 2003 , 2006 .\n\nWe have restricted the current as well as previous reviews to peerreviewed articles reporting the bioactivity or pharmacology of structurally characterized marine compounds. As we have done previously, we have continued to use a modification of Schmitz's chemical classification (Schmitz et al., 1993) to assign marine natural product structures to six major chemical classes, namely, polyketides, terpenes, peptides, alkaloids, shikimates, and sugars. Novel antibacterial, anticoagulant, antifungal, antimalarial, antiprotozoal, antituberculosis and antiviral preclinical pharmacology of marine metabolites are presented in Table 1 with the corresponding structures shown in Fig. 1 . Marine compounds that affect the immune and nervous systems, as well as those with anti-inflammatory effects are grouped in Table 2 , with their corresponding structures presented in Fig. 2 . Finally, marine compounds that have been demonstrated to affect a variety of cellular and molecular targets are exhibited in Table 3 , and their structures depicted in Fig. 3 . Several articles were published during 2007-8 reporting the preclinical pharmacology of extracts or structurally uncharacterized marine compounds, and although these have not been included in the present review, they probably may warrant further investigation: antimicrobial effects of the Turkish red alga Jania rubens (Karabay-Yavasoglu et al., 2007) ; antimicrobial activity in Portuguese marine cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. and Synechococcus sp. extracts towards Gram-positive bacteria (Martins et al., 2008) ; antibacterial activity against human and fish bacteria from the sub-Arctic colonial ascidian Synoicum pulmonaria from northern Norway (Tadesse et al., 2008) ; strong antibiotic-producing potential in actinomycetes from sediments in the Trondheim fjord in Norway (Bredholt et al., 2008) ; antibacterial activity of deep-sea bacteria from sediments of the West Pacific Ocean ; potent antimicrobial activity in the green alga Enteromorpha intestinalis collected in Gujarat, India (Nair et al., 2007) ; a nonhemolytic antimicrobial lipopeptide derived from the marine bacterium Bacillus circulans (Das et al., 2008) ; a T-antigen binding lectin with bioactivity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria from the sea cucumber Holothuria scabra (Gowda et al., 2008) ; anticoagulant activity of a 100-500 kDa polysaccharide isolated from the fermented red seaweed Lomentaria catenata which was greater than the clinical anticoagulant heparin (Pushpamali et al., 2008) ; antimycobacterial activity in long-chain fatty acids isolated from the red alga Polysiphonia virgata (Saravanakumar et al., 2008) ; antileishmanial and anti-trichomonal activity in organic extracts of several Mexican red and brown algae Moo-Puc et al., 2008) ; anti-HIV-1 activity of novel sulfated galactans isolated from the Chinese red algae Grateloupia longifolia and Grateloupia filicina ; significant anti-herpes simplex virus activity in a 30 kDa polysaccharide isolated from the red alga Gracilaria corticata ; immunomodulatory effects of an enzymatic extract from the South Korean marine brown alga Ecklonia cava on murine splenocytes (Ahn et al., 2008) ; immunostimulant properties of a sulfated polysaccharide isolated from the Brazilian red alga Champia feldmannii ; antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of the Indian red and brown seaweed methanolic extracts with high phenolic contents (Devi et al., 2008) ; and decreased expression of key regulatory genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthetic pathways by the lipid extract of the cyanobacterium Nostoc commune var. sphaeroides K\u00fctzing (Rasmussen et al., 2008) .\n\n2. Marine compounds with antibacterial, anticoagulant, antifungal, antimalarial, antiprotozoal, antituberculosis, and antiviral activities Table 1 presents preclinical pharmacology reported during 2007-8 on the antibacterial, anticoagulant, antifungal, antimalarial, antiprotozoal, antituberculosis, and antiviral pharmacology of the marine natural products (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74) shown in Fig. 1 .\n\nContributing to the global search for new antimicrobials to combat antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria, marine ecological niches have been described recently as \"particularly promising\" (Fischbach and Walsh, 2009) . During 2007-8, 38 studies reported novel antibacterial marine natural products isolated from marine bacteria, fungi, sponges, worms and fish, a larger effort than the ones reported in previous years (Mayer et al., 2009) , and previous reviews of this series.\n\nOnly six papers provided detailed mechanism of action studies with marine antimicrobial compounds. Kanoh et al. (2008b) reported the discovery of the novel bioactive spirodioxynaphthalene ascochytatin (1) isolated from cultures of a marine-derived fungus Ascochyta sp. NGB4, which inhibited B. subtilis growth (MID= 0.3 \u03bcg/disk) by targeting the function of the bacterial growth regulatory system TCS (YycG/YycF). Kitani et al. (2008) discovered that the 120 kDa acidic glycoprotein L-amino acid oxidase termed SSAP (2), isolated from the rockfish Sebastes schlegelli (Kitani et al., 2007) , acted selectively on Gram-negative bacteria (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 0.078-0.63 \u03bcg/mL). While H 2 O 2 was shown to mediate the antibacterial action of SSAP, electron microscopy analysis revealed that SSAP induced cell surface damage and morphological changes in several bacterial species. reported that the 21-residue peptide arenicin-1 (3) isolated from the marine polychaete Arenicola marina exhibited significant antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 2 \u03bcg/mL). Interestingly, arenicin-1 induced release of calcein from PE/PG liposomes, thus suggesting that the bacterial cell membrane is the main molecular target of the peptide. Jang et al. (2007c) extended the pharmacology of the alkaloid isoaaptamine (4), isolated from the marine sponge Aaaptos aaptos. Isoaaptamine inhibited sortase A (IC 50 =3.7 \u03bcg/mL), an enzyme involved in S. aureus cell wall protein anchoring and virulence, thus potentially providing a novel lead compound \"for further development\" of potent antibacterials. Lee et al. (2008) isolated seven sesterterpenes (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 ) from a tropical sponge Dysidea sp. which demonstrated antibacterial activity against B. subtilis (MIC = 1.56-12.5 \u03bcg/mL) by inhibiting isocitrate lyase activity, a key enzyme in the glyoxylate cycle which is present in most prokaryotes, lower eukaryotes and plants, but not in vertebrates. Kanoh et al. (2008a) described a new sulfoalkylresorcinol (12) isolated (Kossuga et al., 2008) (continued on next page) from the marine-derived fungus Zygosporium sp. KNC52, which showed antimicrobial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The mechanism of action appeared to involve inhibition (IC 50 =12.5 \u03bcg/ mL) of the in vitro polymerization of FtsZ, a protein which is a structural homolog of eukaryotic tubulin, and that participates in bacterial cell division. As shown in Table 1 , several new marine antibacterials were also reported in 2007-8 ( Fig. 1) with MICs less than 10 \u03bcg/mL against antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, although no mechanism of action studies were reported: the alkaloids ambiguine isonitriles H and I (13 14) isolated from a marine cyanobacterium Fischerella sp. (Raveh and Carmeli, 2007) ; the polyketides ariakemicins A and B (15, 16) isolated from a marine gliding bacterium Rapidithrix sp. (Oku et al., 2008) ; ayamycin (17) isolated from a bacterium Nocardia sp. ALAA 2000 (El-Gendy et al., 2008a) ; the alkaloids batzelladines L and M (18, 19) isolated from the Caribbean sponge Monanchora unguifera (Hua et al., 2007) ; a diphenyl ether (20) isolated from the Indonesian sponge Lamellodysidea herbacea (Hanif et al., 2007) ; essramycin (21) obtained from the culture broth of a marine Streptomyces sp. isolate Merv8102 (El-Gendy et al., 2008b) ; a meroditerpene (+)-isojaspic acid (22) isolated from the Papua New Guinean sponge Cacospongia sp. (Rubio et al., 2007) ; the bisindole pyrroles lynamicins A-D (23, 24, 25, 26) isolated from a novel marine actinomycete Marinispora sp. (McArthur et al., 2008) ; lipoxazolidinones A and B (27, 28) isolated from a marine actinomycete Marinispora sp. (Macherla et al., 2007) ; marinopyrrole A (29) isolated from an obligate marine Streptomyces strain (Hughes et al., 2008) ; a furanosesquiterpene (-)-microcionin-1 (30) isolated from a marine sponge Fasciospongia sp. (Gaspar et al., 2008) ; a macrolide phomolide B (31) isolated from a fungus Phomopsis sp. ; a sargaquinoic acid derivative (32) isolated from the brown alga Sargassum sagamianum (Horie et al., 2008) , and tauramamide (33), a lipopeptide isolated from the bacterium Brevibacillus laterosporus PNG276 (Desjardine et al., 2007) .\n\nFurthermore during this period, several novel marine metabolites with moderate antimicrobial activity (MIC or IC 50 ranging from 10 to 50 \u03bcg/mL, or 10 to 50 \u03bcM, respectively), were also reported, but their weaker antibacterial activity precluded their inclusion in either Table 1 or Fig. 1 : acetylmajapolene A (MIC = 20 \u03bcg/disk) (Vairappan et al., 2008) , callophycoic acids A, B, G and H (MIC = 16-63.9 \u03bcg/mL) (Lane et al., 2007) ; corallidictyals A, B, C and D (MIC less than 20 \u03bcg/ mL) ; (S)-(+)-curcuphenol analogs (IC 50 = 34-44 \u03bcM) (Gul et al., 2007) ; cyclomarazines A and B (MIC = 13-18 \u03bcg/ mL) (Schultz et al., 2008) ; dehydroxychlorofusarielin B (MIC = 62.5 \u03bcg/mL) (Nguyen et al., 2007) , nodosol (MIC = 16 \u03bcg/ mL) (Kontiza et al., 2008) ; paeciloxanthone (MIC = 40 \u03bcg/disk) , palmitoleic acid (IC 50 = 10-20 \u03bcM) (Desbois et al., 2008) ; puupehenone-metabolites (MIC = 8-16 \u03bcg/mL) ; Tripalea clavaria C-secosteroids (MIC = 25 \u03bcg/disk) (Rodriguez Brasco et al., 2007) , shishididemniols A and B (MIC = 20 \u03bcg/disk) (Kobayashi et al., 2007b) , and zafrin (MIC = 50-125 \u03bcg/mL) (Uzair et al., 2008) .\n\nNoteworthy were reports of novel marine antimicrobial peptides: dicentracin, a new component of the moronecidin family isolated from head kidney leukocytes from the sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax (Salerno et al., 2007) ; hepcidins, three novel antimicrobial peptides isolated from the tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus, with MICs (50-100 \u03bcg/mL) against Listeria monocytogenes, S. aureus, and Enterococcus faecium (Huang et al., 2007) ; scygonadin, a novel anionic antimicrobial peptide from the seminal plasma of the mud crab, Scylla serrata , and tunichromes, small dehydrodopaminecontaining peptides found in hemocyte cells of the ascidian Ascidia nigra that are capable of crosslinking proteins in vitro (Cai et al., 2008) .\n\nFour articles published during 2007-8, reported anticoagulant marine natural products isolated from algae and clams, a number very similar to that reported in our previous review (Mayer et al., 2009) , and other reviews of this marine pharmacology series. Jung et al. (2007b) characterized a novel 7.7 kDa anticoagulant polypeptide termed TGAP with a partial sequence (34) from the muscle protein of the South Korean bivalve Tegillarca granosa. The anticoagulant polypeptide, which demonstrated low in vitro cytotoxicity to venous endothelial cells, specifically inhibited the blood coagulation factor Va, as well as the molecular interaction between factor IIa and factor Va in a ascochytatin (1 thrombin as well as potentiated antithrombin III-mediated inhibition of coagulation factor Xa.\n\nTen studies during 2007-8 reported on the antifungal activity of several novel marine natural products isolated from marine algae, bacteria, sponges and sea cucumbers, a decrease from our last review (Mayer et al., 2009) , and previous reviews of this series.\n\nAs shown in Table 1 , only one report extended the molecular pharmacology of novel antifungal marine metabolites. Symphyocladia latiuscula bromophenols (192, 193, 194, 195 Furthermore, several marine natural products showed significant antifungal activity (i.e. MICs that were either less than 10 \u03bcg/mL, 10 \u03bcM, or 10 \u03bcg/disk) (Table 1 and Fig. 1; 38 , 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44) , although no mechanism of action studies were reported in the published articles: callipeltins J and K (38, 39), MIC = 1 \u03bcM (D' Auria et al., 2007) , the triterpene glycoside holothurin B (40), MIC = 1.56 \u03bcg/ mL (Kumar et al., 2007) , the macrolide neopeltolide (41), MIC = 0.62 \u03bcg/mL , the cyclopeptide pedein A (42), MIC= 0.6-1.6 \u03bcg/mL (Kunze et al., 2008) , and pseudoceratins A and B (43, 44), MIC = 6.5-8.0 \u03bcg/disk (Jang et al., 2007b) . Hopefully, future studies on the molecular pharmacology of these marine compounds will elucidate their mechanisms of action.\n\nFinally, several novel structurally characterized marine molecules isolated from sponges demonstrated MICs or IC 50 s greater than 10 \u03bcg/ mL or 10 \u03bcM, and therefore, because of the reported weaker antifungal activity, they have been excluded from Table 1 and Fig. 1 : eurysterols A and B (MIC = 15.6-62.5 \u03bcg/mL) (Boonlarppradab and Faulkner, 2007) ; nagelamides M and N (MIC = 33.3 \u03bcg/mL) (Kubota et al., 2008) , nortetillapyrone (MIC = 31-62 \u03bcg/mL) (Wattanadilok et al., 2007) , and Tydemania expeditionis triterpenoids (IC 50 = 26-55 \u03bcM) (Jiang et al., 2008) . These marine compounds may yet provide additional pharmacological leads in the ongoing global search for clinically useful antifungal agents.\n\nAs shown in Table 1 an increase from our previous review (Mayer et al., 2009) , and previous reviews of this series.\n\nAs shown in Table 1 , nine marine molecules were shown during 2007-8 to possess significant antimalarial activity, although mechanism of action studies were reported for only two compounds. Tasdemir et al. (2007) reported that (E)-oroidin (45) and (E)-oroidin TFA salt (46) isolated from the Turkish marine sponge Agelas oroides potently inhibited cultures of multidrug resistant K1 strain of Plasmodium falciparum (IC 50 = 3.9 and 7.9 \u03bcg/mL, respectively) with concomitant inhibition of FabI (enoyl-ACP reductase), a key enzyme of the type II fatty acid synthase cascade (IC 50 = 0.3 and 5.0 \u03bcg/mL, respectively). Further studies revealed that oroidin free base appeared to bind to \"the enzyme-substrate complex or enzyme-cofactor complex\" by an uncompetitive mechanism, providing further pharmacological characterization of the \"first antimalarial marine natural product that targets P. falciparum FabI\".\n\nAdditional antimalarial activity was reported for seven marine compounds. Two reports were contributed during 2007 by the Panama International Cooperative Biodiversity Groups project: McPhail et al. (2007) isolated a novel linear lipopeptide dragomabin (47) from the cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula with moderate antimalarial activity (IC 50 =6.0 \u03bcM), and significant differential toxicity between the malarial parasite and mammalian cells. Linington et al. (2007) discovered that the new cyclic hexapeptides venturamides A and B (48, 49) isolated from a Panamanian marine cyanobacterium Oscillatoria sp., demonstrated significant in vitro antiplasmodial activity against the W2 chloroquinone-resistant strain of the parasite (IC 50 =5.6-8.2 \u03bcM), with mild cytotoxicity to mammalian cells, the first \"example of the identification of cyanobacterial peptides with selective antimalarial activity\". Kasettrathat et al. (2008) proved that a new tetronic acid, nodulisporacid A (50), from a marine-derived fungus Nodulisporium sp. CRIF1 isolated from a Thai soft coral, was moderately antiplasmodial (IC 50 =1-10 \u03bcM) against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strain 94. Na et al. (2008) identified a new marine Streptomyces sp. H668 polyether (51) from Hawaii that showed in vitro antimalarial activity (IC 50 =0.1-0.2 \u03bcg/mL) against both P. falciparum chloroquine-susceptible (D6) and -resistant (W2) clones, with minimal cytotoxicity towards mammalian cells. Clark et al. (2008) found that a novel acylproline derivative, tumonoic acid I (52) from the Papua New Guinean marine cyanobacterium Blennothrix cantharidosmum, showed moderate antimalarial activity against P. falciparum (IC 50 =2 \u03bcM). Pontius et al. (2008a) isolated a heterocyclicsubstituted xanthone, chaetoxanthone B (53) from cultures of a marinederived fungus Chaetomium sp. that showed selective activity towards P. falciparum K1 strain (IC 50 =0.5 \u03bcg/mL).\n\nFour marine compounds were reported to possess antiprotozoal activity. Kossuga et al. (2008) re-isolated the previously reported plakortide P (54) from the marine sponge Plakortis angulospiculatus. The compound displayed selective effects against both Leishmania chagasi (IC 50 = 0.5-1.9 \u03bcg/mL) and Trypanosoma cruzi (IC 50 = 2.3 \u03bcg/ mL), with low concomitant hemolytic and cytotoxic activities towards human macrophages. Reportedly, the mechanism of action towards intracellular L. chagasi did not appear to involve nitric oxide. Simmons et al. (2008) found that two novel lipopeptides viridamides A and B (55, 56) were nearly \"equipotent\" in inhibiting both Leishmania mexicana (IC 50 = 1.1 \u03bcM) and T. cruzi (IC 50 = 1.5 \u03bcM). Besides the antimalarial activity, Pontius et al. (2008a) discovered that chaetoxanthone B (53) had selective effects towards T. cruzi (IC 50 = 1.5 \u03bcg/ mL), with minimal cytotoxicity towards rat skeletal L6 myoblasts (IC 50 = 47 \u03bcg/mL).\n\nTen new marine compounds were reported in the global search for novel antituberculosis agents, a considerable increase from our previous reviews (Mayer et al., 2009) , and previous reviews of this series. Ospina et al. (2007) isolated a bioactive oxapolycyclic diterpene bipinnapterolide B (57) from the Colombian gorgonian coral Pseudopterogorgia bipinnata which weakly inhibited growth of M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv (66% inhibition at 128 \u03bcg/mL). Zhang et al. (2008) identified two new dimeric naphtha-\u03b3-pyrones 8\u2032-O-demethylnigerone (58) and 8\u2032-O-demethylisonigerone (59) from the marinederived fungus Aspergillus carbonarius which showed weak antimycobacterial activity against M. tuberculosis (H 37 Rv, MIC = 43 and 21.5 \u03bcM, respectively). Interestingly, the presence of conjugated C=C-C=O bonds in the pyrane ring appeared to be crucial for antifungal activity. As a result of a continued investigation of the Caribbean sea whip Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae, Wei et al. (2007a) reported that the novel tricarbocyclic norditerpenes caribenols A (60) and B (61) weakly inhibited M. tuberculosis (H 37 Rv, MIC = 128 and 63 \u03bcg/mL, respectively). Furthermore, Wei et al. (2007b) discovered two novel ring B abeo-sterols parguesterols A (62) and B (63) in the Caribbean sponge Svenzea zeai, which inhibited M. tuberculosis (H 37 Rv, MIC = 7.8 and 11.2 \u03bcg/mL, respectively). Hopefully future information on the selectivity index of these two compounds will provide additional information to support the notion that they might \"constitute important lead structures for the development of novel tuberculosis drugs due to their strong activity, specificity, and low toxicity\". Berrue et al. (2007) noted that several bioactive polyketides, 24-norisospiculoic acid A (64), dinorspiculoic acid A (65), and norspiculoic acid A (66) from the Caribbean sponge Plakortis zyggompha also inhibited M. tuberculosis (H 37 Rv, MIC 99 = 50 \u03bcg/mL). Although all of these studies demonstrate that marine terpenes and polyketides constitute potentially novel antituberculosis leads, they unfortunately did not provide detailed mechanism of action pharmacology at the time of their publication.\n\nAs shown in Table 1 , three reports were published on the antiviral pharmacology of novel marine natural products against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Corona virus, herpes simplex, and dengue virus during 2007-8. de Lira et al. (2007) discovered that the new esculetin-4-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (67) from the Brazilian marine sponge Axinella cf. corrugata inhibited the SARS 3CL protease (IC 50 =46 \u03bcM). This is a potentially significant finding because the 3CL protease is a \"high profile target\" in SARS drug development as it appears to be involved in the release of replicative viral proteins as well as the RNA polymerase. Talarico et al. (2007) reported that a D,L-galactan hybrid C2S-3 (68) isolated from the Brazilian marine alga Cryptonemia crenulata showed potent antiviral activity against three clinical strains of dengue virus serotype 2 (IC 50 =0.8-16 \u03bcg/mL), together with low cytotoxicity. Further mechanistic work determined that C2S-3 appeared to be a \"promising DENV-2 entry inhibitor\". Mandal et al. (2008) described a sulfated xylomannan isolated from the Indian red seaweed Scinaia hatei which inhibited HSV-1 and HSV-2 (IC 50 =0.5-1.4 \u03bcg/mL), with low cytotoxicity, probably interfering with the HSV-1 multiplication cycle. Interestingly the \"very good antiviral activity against the wide spectrum of HSV strains tested\" suggested this compound might be a good candidate for further preclinical research.\n\nFive reports contributed preclinical pharmacology of marine compounds active against the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of the acquired immunodeficiency disease syndrome (AIDS), an increase from our previous reviews (Mayer et al., 2009) , and previous reviews of this series. Artan et al. (2008) reported that the phlorglucinol derivative 6, 6\u2032-bieckol (69) isolated from the brown alga E. cava inhibited HIV-induced syncytia formation (IC 50 = 1.72 \u03bcM), viral p24 antigen production (IC 50 = 1.26 \u03bcM), and the activity of the HIV reverse transcriptase (IC 50 = 1.07 \u03bcM), with \"no cytotoxicity\" at concentrations that inhibited HIV replication \"almost completely\". Cirne-Santos et al. (2008) extended the molecular pharmacology of the diterpene dolabelladienetriol (70) isolated from the marine brown alga Dictyota pfaffii. The dolabellane diterpene blocked both synthesis and integration of the HIV-1 provirus by noncompetitively inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme (Ki = 7.2 \u03bcM). The investigators proposed dolabelladienetriol (70) as a \"potential new agent for anti-HIV-1 therapy\". Plaza et al. (2007) described three new depsipeptides mirabamides A, C and D (71, 72, 73) isolated from the sponge Siliquariaspongia mirabilis that potently inhibited both HIV-1 in neutralization (IC 50 = 0.14-0.19 \u03bcM) and HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell fusion (IC 50 = 0.14-3.9 \u03bcM), suggesting these compounds act at an early stage of HIV-1 cell infection, \"presumably through interactions with HIV-1 envelope proteins\". Lu et al. (2007) added a \"novel mechanistic profiling\" of the previously reported sulfated polymannuroguluronate (SPMG) (74), a polysaccharide with an average molecular weight of 8.0 kDa isolated from the brown alga Laminaria japonica, that has been reported to be in Phase II clinical trials in China as an anti-AIDS drug candidate. SPMG appeared to eliminate the viral gene product known as transactivator of transcription protein (Tat)induced signal transduction as well as angiogenesis in AIDSassociated Kaposi's sarcoma cells. Furthermore, in 2008, Hui et al. (2008) demonstrated that SPMG appeared to show a neuroprotective effect because it decreased apoptosis caused by Tat-stimulated calcium overload in PC12 neuronal cells, thus suggesting SPMG might warrant further clinical studies in HIV-associated dementia. Table 2 summarizes the preclinical pharmacological research completed during 2007-8 with the marine compounds (75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132) shown in Fig. 2. \n\nThe anti-inflammatory pharmacology of marine compounds reported during 2007-8 showed a considerable increase from our previous review (Mayer et al., 2009) , and previous reviews of this series. Several marine natural products were shown in preclinical pharmacological studies to target arachidonic metabolism in neutrophils and macrophages. Pearce et al. (2007a) reported two new tricyclic alkaloids ascidiathiazone A (75) and B (76) isolated from a New Zealand ascidian Aplidium species that affected superoxide production by human neutrophils in vitro (IC 50 = 0.44-1.55 \u03bcM), as well as murine peritoneal neutrophis ex vivo, with concomitant \"low or nonexistent\" liver and renal toxicity, thus suggesting that these two compounds might become \"potential anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical\" leads. Chao et al. (2008) identified the new cembranolides crassumolides A and C (77, 78) from the soft coral Lobophytum crassum which inhibited expression of iNOS and COX-2 (apparent IC 50 less than 10 \u03bcM). Similarly, from the same university, Cheng et al. (2008) found that new cembranolides from the soft coral Lobophytum duru, durumolides A-C (79, 80, 81) inhibited both the iNOS and COX-2 proteins in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells in vitro (apparent IC 50 less than 10 \u03bcM), suggesting that the \u03b1-methylene-\u03b3-lactone moiety of these compounds was necessary for the observed activity. Shen et al. (2007) showed that new briarane-type diterpenoids frajunolides B and C (82, 83), isolated from the Taiwanese gorgonian Junceella fragilis, significantly inhibited superoxide anion and elastase generation from human neutrophils in vitro (apparent IC 50 greater than 10 \u03bcg/mL). Dang et al. (2008) demonstrated that the previously described fatty acids (84, 85) from the South Korean marine red alga Gracilaria verrucosa inhibited release by LPS-activated murine macrophages of the inflammatory nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin-6 (apparent IC 50 less than 20 \u03bcg/mL), thus revealing that the conjugated enone moiety played a critical role in the antiinflammatory activity observed in vitro. Bittencourt et al. (2008) contributed novel preclinical pharmacology on a previously reported 90 amino acid polypeptide (86) isolated from the red alga Hypnea cervicornis. The mucin-binding agglutinin, which was extensively characterized with several in vivo models of nociception and inflammation, probably exerted its anti-inflammatory activity (apparent IC 50 = 0.1-1 mg/kg) via interaction of the polypeptide with the lectin carbohydrate-binding site, although the exact mechanism of action remains undetermined. El Sayed et al. (2008) demonstrated that manzamine A (87), (\u2212)-8-hydroxymanzamine A (88), and hexahydro-8-hydroxymanzamine A (89) potently inhibited TXB 2 generation (IC 50 = 0.25, less than 0.1, and 1.97 \u03bcM, respectively) in brain microglia. These findings provide further support to the notion that manzamine alkaloids appear to be \"viable anti-inflammatory leads\" for the preclinical pharmaceutical development of agents to modulate both activated brain microglia and eicosanoid generation. Treschow et al. (2007) investigated four novel \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (90, 91, 92, 93) from the New Zealand green-lipped mussel Perna canaliculus with an in vitro bioassay that used stimulated human neutrophil 5-lipoxygenase, demonstrating that the putative antiinflammatory potential of these compounds might be related to inhibition of leukotriene and prostaglandin metabolite production. Sansom et al. (2007) reported a bis-prenylated quinone (94) from the New Zealand brown alga Perithalia capillaris which inhibited superoxide anion production in human neutrophils (IC 50 = 2.1 \u03bcM) in vitro, with low toxicity. An explanation as to why the authors decided not to investigate the quinone \"as an anti-inflammatory lead\" remains unclear, although it was strongly cytotoxic towards human leukemia cells (IC 50 = 0.34 \u03bcM). Sugiura et al. (2007) characterized a novel antiallergic phlorotannin phlorofucofuroeckol B (PFF-B) (95) from the edible brown alga Eisenia arborea. PFF-B, inhibited \u03b2-hexosaminidase release from rat basophilic leukemia cells (IC 50 = 7.8 \u03bcM) in vitro, thus showing higher potency than Tranilast (Rizaben\u00ae) (IC 50 = 46.6 \u03bcM), a pharmaceutical agent used for treatment of allergic disorders such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis in Japan and South Korea. Kossuga et al. (2008) demonstrated that the polyketide plakortide P (54) isolated from the Brazilian sponge P. angulospiculatus, potently inhibited thromboxane B 2 release (IC 50 = 0.93 \u03bcM) from activated rat brain microglia, thus extending the preclinical pharmacology of this compound, which besides being antiparasitic as discussed earlier in this review, also appears to be a potentially \"novel antineuroinflammatory agent\". Pearce et al. (2007b) examined a halogenated furanone rubrolide O (96) isolated from a New Zealand ascidian Synoicum n. sp., which inhibited superoxide anion production in human neutrophils (IC 50 = 35 \u03bcM) in vitro with low toxicity. Although rubrolides have been reported to be cytotoxic and antibacterial, the authors proposed that the anti-inflammatory activity for these tunicate metabolites though moderate was \"unprecedented\". Khan et al. (2007) identified a \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid stearidonic acid (97) from the South Korean brown seaweed Undaria pinnatifida, which was shown to be very active against PMAinduced mouse ear inflammation symptoms, edema, erythema and blood flows (IC 50 = 160, 314 and 235 \u03bcg/per ear, respectively). The in vivo data compared well with indomethacin which was used as a positive control (IC 50 = 90, 172, 179 \u03bcg/per ear, respectively), and thus supported claims that this \"seaweed can be used as a remedy for inflammation-related symptoms\". Kobayashi et al. (2007a) discovered a novel dimeric oroidin derivative carteramine A (98) in the marine sponge Stylissa carteri, and showed that it inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis (IC 50 = 5 \u03bcM). The authors suggested that because carteramine A has no structural resemblance to known compounds that inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis, their finding provides a \"novel platform to develop a new class of anti-inflammatory agents\". Taori et al. (2007) identified three new analogues of dolastatin 13, lyngbyastatins 5-7 (99, 100, 101), isolated from marine cyanobacteria Lyngbya spp. from South Florida. Although the three compounds selectively and potently inhibited porcine pancreatic elastase (IC 50 = 3-10 nM), suggesting a potential therapeutic use in pathophysiological conditions where elastase overactivity is involved, no mechanism of action studies were reported at the time. Oh et al. (2008) purified a novel polyketide salinipyrone A (102) from the marine actinomycete Salinispora pacifica, which moderately inhibited interleukin-5 (IC 50 = 10 \u03bcg/mL) in a mouse splenocyte model of allergic inflammation, with low cell cytotoxicity.\n\nThe pharmacology of the marine compounds reporting activity on the immune system during 2007-8 showed a considerable increase from our previous review (Mayer et al., 2009) , and previous reviews of this series. Kawauchi et al. (2007) investigated the red pigment cycloprodigiosin hydrochloride (103) isolated from the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas denitrificans. Interestingly, the compound suppressed activator protein 1 (AP-1) (apparent IC 50 = 1 \u03bcM), and downstream gene expression of interleukin 8, a chemokine involved in the innate immune system. Courtois et al. (2008) assessed the effect of the known compound floridoside (104), isolated from the French red alga Mastocarpus stellatus on the complement system. Floridoside was observed to potently activate the classical complement pathway (apparent IC 50 = 5.9-9.3 \u03bcg/mL) by recruiting immunoglobulin M (IgM), suggesting that the compound might be an \"important step in the development of a potent new anticomplementary agent\" useful in therapy aimed at addressing complement depletion. Greve et al. (2007) reported that the novel iso-iantheran A and 8-carboxy-iso-iantheran A (105, 106) purified from the Australian marine sponge Ianthella quadrangulata demonstrated agonist activity at P2Y 11 receptors (IC 50 = 1.29 and 0.48 \u03bcM, respectively). This finding represents an interesting contribution to ionotropic purine receptor P2Y 11 pharmacology, because these receptors have been shown to affect the maturation and differentiation of dendritic cells. Huh et al. (2007) extended the pharmacology of prodigiosin (107) isolated from the marine bacterium Hahella chejuencis collected in South Korea. Prodigiosin inhibited iNOS mRNA expression and NO production (apparent IC 50 = 0.1 \u03bcg/mL) by a mechanism that involved inhibition of NF-\u03baB and p38 MAPK and JNK phosphorylation. He et al. (2007) characterized the pharmacology of a water soluble polysaccharide (108) isolated from the mollusc Arca subcrenata Lischke, a popular Chinese seafood, and named it ASLP. ASLP stimulated mouse spleen lymphocyte proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner (apparent IC 50 less than 100 \u03bcg/mL), and with the \"branches of ASLP\" being required for the immunomodulatory bioactivity. Aminin et al. (2008) described the immunostimulant activity of frondoside A (109), a triterpene glycoside isolated from the sea cucumber Cucumaria frondosa. The glycoside was shown to stimulate lysosomal activity and phagocytosis in mouse macrophages, as well as reactive oxygen species formation. Oda et al. (2007) provided novel information on the molecular mechanisms affected by smenospongidine, smenospongiarine and smenospongine (110, 111, 112) , sesquiterpene quinones previously isolated from a Palauan marine sponge Hippospongia sp. The observation that at 10 \u03bcg/mL, these compounds promoted interleukin-8 release, a member of the C-X-C chemokine superfamily which is involved in tumor progression and metastasis, suggested that \"the functional group at C-18\" might play a yet undetermined role in the observed results. Yamada et al. (2007) isolated the novel macrosphelide M (113) and peribysin J (114) from Periconia byssoides, a fungal strain discovered from the sea hare Aplysia kurodai. Significantly, both fungal metabolites inhibited the adhesion of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (IC 50 = 33.2 and 11.8 \u03bcM, respectively) more potently than herbimycin A (IC 50 = 38 \u03bcM). The latter compound, a benzochinoid ansamycin antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces sp. was used as a positive control in these studies. Lu et al. (2008) contributed a novel cembranolide querciformolide C (115) from the soft coral Sinularia querciformis, which significantly inhibited the activation of the iNOS and COX-2 enzymes (apparent IC 50 less than 10 \u03bcM) in LPS-activated murine macrophages in vitro. Ponomarenko et al. (2007) discovered that new diterpenoids (116, 117) isolated from a Northern Cook Islands marine sponge Spongia (Heterofibria) sp. moderately activated murine splenocytes lysosomes (apparent IC 50 greater than 100 \u03bcg/mL). Oh et al. (2007) characterized a novel cyclic peptide thalassospiramide B (118) isolated from a marine bacterium Thalassospira sp., which showed immunosuppressive activity in an interleukin-5 (IL-5) inhibition assay (IC 50 = 5 \u03bcM); an interesting finding because IL-5 is expressed both in eosinophils and mast cells in asthmatic patients.\n\nPharmacological studies with marine compounds affecting the nervous system involved three areas of neuropharmacology: the stimulation of neurogenesis, the targeting of receptors, and other miscellaneous activities on the nervous system.\n\nMarine natural products reported to be neuritogenic, might be used to treat damaged neuronal cells, and potentially neurodegenerative diseases. As shown in Table 2 , compounds (119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126) isolated from sea stars and a brown alga were observed to enhance the neuritogenic properties of nerve growth factor (NGF), a compound that has a critical role in differentiation, survival, and neuronal regeneration. Kicha et al. (2007b) contributed two new steroid glycosides, linckosides L1 (119) and L2 (120) isolated from the Vietnamese blue sea star Linckia laevigata. All three glycosides (apparent IC 50 = 0.3 \u03bcM) showed synergistic effects on NGF-induced (2 ng/mL) neurite outgrowth of murine neuroblastoma C-1300 cells. Han et al. (2007) contributed the novel steroid glycosides linckosides M-Q (121, 122, 123, 124, 125) from the Japanese sea star L. laevigata. Linckoside P (124) induced neurite outgrowth in 55% of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells at 10 \u03bcM in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF), while linckosides M-O appeared less active (21-32%), suggesting the importance of \"the xylose on a side chain\". Ina et al. (2007) characterized pheophytin A (126) purified from the Japanese brown alga Sargassum fulvellum as a novel neurodifferentiation compound. Pheophytin A at 3.9 \u03bcg/mL was observed to synergize with NGF (50 ng/mL) in promoting neurite outgrowth in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells by a mechanism that appeared to involve activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling.\n\nAs shown in Table 2 , during 2007-8, three marine compounds (127, 128, 129) were reported to target receptors in the nervous system. Peng et al. (2008) reported on the preclinical pharmacology of the \u03b14/7conotoxin Lp1.1 (127) originally isolated from the marine cone snail Conus leopardus. The conotoxin induced seizure and paralysis in goldfish, and selectively yet reversibly inhibited acetylcholine-evoked currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing rat \u03b16\u03b13\u03b22 and \u03b13\u03b22 nicotinic receptors (apparent IC 50 less than 10 \u03bcM). Aiello et al. (2007) characterized two novel bromopyrrole alkaloids damipipecolin (128) and damituricin (129) isolated from the Mediterranean sponge Axinella damicornis that were observed to modulate serotonin receptor activity in vitro. Although damipipecolin inhibited Ca 2+ entry in neurons (apparent IC 50 =1 \u03bcg/mL), the serotonin receptor subtype involved in the mechanism of action remains undetermined.\n\nFinally, as shown in Table 2 , during 2007-8, additional marine compounds (74 and 130, 131, 132) were reported to have miscellaneous effects on components of the nervous system. Contributing to the ongoing search for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Langjae et al. (2007) reported a new stigmastane-type steroidal alkaloid 4-acetoxy-plakinamine B (130), isolated from a Thai marine sponge Corticium sp. that significantly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (IC 50 = 3.75 \u03bcM). Compound 130 was reported to be the \"first marine-derived acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting steroidal alkaloid\" with a mechanism of action involving an unusual mixed-competitive mode of inhibition. Choi et al. (2007) extended the molecular pharmacology of two known meroditerpenes, sargaquinoic acid (131) and sargachromenol (132) isolated from the brown alga S. sagamianum. Sargaquinoic acid potently inhibited butyrylcholinesterase (IC 50 = 26 nM), a novel target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, with potency comparable to or greater than anticholinesterases in current clinical use. Hui et al. (2008) further characterized the neuroprotective effects of the polysaccharide sulfated polymannuroguluronate (SPMG) (74), noted earlier as currently being in Phase II clinical trials in China as an anti-AIDS drug candidate. SPMG appeared to decrease the Tat-stimulated calcium overload in PC12 neuronal cells as well as concomitant apoptosis-signaling cascades, thus demonstrating a potential for further clinical development as a therapeutic intervention in HIVassociated dementia. Table 3 lists 65 marine compounds with miscellaneous pharmacological mechanisms of action, and their respective structures (133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197) are presented in Fig. 3 . Because during 2007-8 additional pharmacological data were unavailable, it was not possible to assign these marine compounds to a particular drug class as was possible with the compounds included in Tables 1  and 2.  Table 3 shows 14 marine natural products that the peer-reviewed literature reported with a pharmacological activity, an IC 50 , and a molecular mechanism of action affected by the respective compound: azumamide E (133), 1-deoxyrubralactone (134), fucoxanthin (135), okadaic acid (136), saproxanthin and myxol (137, 138), sarcomilasterol (139), spirastrellolides C, D, and E (140, 141, 142), Spongia sesterterpenoid (143), stylissadines A and B (144, 145) and symbiodinolide (146).\n\nIn contrast, although a pharmacological activity was described, and an IC 50 for inhibition of an enzyme or receptor determined, detailed molecular mechanism of action studies were unavailable at the time of publication for the following 51 marine compounds included in Table 3 : Asterias amurensis saponin (147), Botrytis sp. \u03b1-pyrone derivative (148) (185), Sargassum siliquastrum meroditerpenoids (186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191) , Symphyocladia latiuscula bromophenols (192, 193, 194, 195) , and tenacibactins C and D (196, 197) .\n\nSeveral reviews covering both general and specific subject areas of marine pharmacology were published during 2007-8: (a) general marine pharmacology: marine natural products with an emphasis on source organisms and relevant biological activities (Blunt et al., 2007 (Blunt et al., , 2008 ; the value of natural products to future pharmaceutical discovery ; the structures and bioactivities of secondary metabolites from cyanobacteria (Gademann and Portmann, 2008) ; bioactive natural products from marine cyanobacteria for drug discovery (Tan L.T., 2007) ; bioactive compounds from fungi in the South China Sea (Pan et al., 2008) ; biochemical and pharmacological functions of \u03b2-carboline alkaloids (Cao et al., 2007) ; pharmacological properties of lamellarin alkaloids (Kluza et al., 2008) ; biological activity of brown seaweed fucoidans (Kusaykin et al., 2008; ; potential pharmacological uses of the marine green alga polysaccharide ulvan (Lahaye and Robic, 2007) ; pharmacological properties of marine bis-and tris-indole alkaloids (Gupta et al., 2007) ; (b) antimicrobial marine pharmacology: a renaissance of genomics in antibacterial discovery from actinomycetes (Baltz R.H., 2008) ; mining marine genomics for novel drug discovery from phytosymbionts of marine invertebrates (Dunlap et al., 2007) ; (c) anticoagulant and cardiovascular pharmacology: structure, biology, evolution and medical importance of sulfated fucans and galactans as potential antithrombotic compounds (Pomin and Mourao, 2008) ; (d) antituberculosis, antimalarial and antifungal marine pharmacology: natural product growth inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Copp and Pearce, 2007) ; new advances in novel marine fatty acids as antimalarials, antimycobacterial and antifungal agents (Carballeira N.M., 2008) ; depsipeptides from microorganisms as a new class of antimalarials (Fotie and Morgan, 2008) ; the manzamine alkaloids for the control of malaria and tuberculosis (Hamann M.T., 2007) ; (e) immuno-and anti-inflammatory marine pharmacology: chemistry and biology of anti-inflammatory marine natural products (Abad et al., 2008) ; marine natural products as targeted modulators of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB (Folmer et al., 2008) ; glycolipids as immunostimulating agents ); (f) nervous system marine pharmacology: marine-derived drugs in neurology (Martinez A., 2007) ; neuritogenic gangliosides from marine echinoderms (Higuchi et al., 2007) ; (g) miscellaneous molecular targets: enzyme inhibitors from marine invertebrates (Nakao and Fusetani, 2007) ; natural products as aromatase inhibitors (Balunas et al., 2008) ; biology of the aeruginosin family of serine protease inhibitors (Ersmark et al., 2008) ; and marine natural products affecting membrane and intracellular processes, and ion channels (Folmer et al., 2007) .\n\nSix years after the approval of the marine compound ziconotide (Prialt\u00ae) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Williams et al., 2008) , the global marine preclinical pharmaceutical pipeline remains very active. The marine pharmaceutical clinical pipeline is available at http://marinepharmacology.midwestern.edu/clinDev.htm and has recently been reviewed (Mayer et al., 2010) .\n\nThe current marine preclinical pipeline review contributes to the annual review series which was initiated in 1998 (Mayer and Lehmann, 2000; Mayer and Hamann, 2002 , 2005 Mayer et al., 2007 Mayer et al., , 2009 ) and reveals the breadth of preclinical pharmacological research during 2007-8, which resulted from the global effort of natural products chemists and pharmacologists from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Kingdom, Vietnam, and the United States.\n\nThus, it appears that the marine preclinical pharmaceutical pipeline continues to contribute novel pharmacological lead compounds that will probably enable a future expansion of the marine clinical pharmaceutical pipeline, which currently consists of 13 compounds in Phase I, II and III of clinical development (Mayer et al., 2010) ."}
