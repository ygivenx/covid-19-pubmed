{"title": "", "body": "Ideally, the entire animal is submitted to a diagnostic laboratory for complete postmortem examination. If this is not possible, the necropsy may be performed at the clinic, and collected samples can be sent to a diagnostic laboratory for testing. Some of the advantages and disadvantages of the available approaches are listed in Table 31 -1.\n\nThe pediatric patient poses some unique challenges with respect to postmortem examinations. The quick succession of developmental phases is associated with a rapid change of commonly encountered diseases to which the diagnostic approach has to be tailored. The perinatal puppy or kitten is commonly worked up as an abortion with a simplified gross examination and emphasis on histopathology and microbiological testing. In contrast, animals older than 1 day of age require a thorough and complete necropsy because gross findings determine the menu of additional tests to be performed. Before weaning, health concerns extend to littermates, the dam, and often the breeding program in general. After weaning, the problem is usually viewed as that of an individual animal and rarely of the household.\n\nVery few studies on necropsy findings of the puppy and kitten have been published in the primary literature. In puppies, most deaths occur before rather than after weaning, which amount to more than 20% and less than 5% of all puppy deaths in the first year of life, respectively. More than 50% of the preweaning puppy losses occur during the first week of life. Common causes in this age group are stillbirth (incidence of 2.2% to 4.6%), trauma, failure to thrive, or congenital anomalies resulting in death or euthanasia. In puppies older than 1 week, respiratory and gastrointestinal\n\nPuppy and kitten losses within the first few months of life are a common but unavoidable problem. Postmortem examinations provide essential information for preventative strategies and should be pursued aggressively. This is particularly important when losses occur in the preweaning period, and contributing factors should be eliminated before the next breeding cycle. Postmortem examinations are also an important part of quality assurance and quality control programs of veterinary clinics and provide great opportunities for continued education when faced with the unexpected or unexplained death of a patient or a patient's death despite diagnosis-based treatment. Postmortem examinations address the owner's concern about littermates and other pets in the household, the future of the breeding program, and the owner's health. Results from a postmortem examination can also provide consolation, particularly after the difficult decision to have a pet euthanized.\n\nA postmortem examination is actually a series of examinations. The gross examination during the necropsy of the animal is followed by the microscopic examination of fixed tissues (histopathology). Often additional tests on fresh tissues like microbiology (bacteriology, virology, parasitology, mycology, and serology) and/or toxicology (chemical analysis of tissues for toxins, minerals, and heavy metals) are necessary to determine the specific etiology of an identified disease process. These additional tests can be requested at time of necropsy, or samples may be collected and saved for testing at a later time, for example, when histopathology results are available and allow a focused approach to further testing to minimize expenses. diseases are the most common primary issues identified on postmortem examination, followed by malnutrition. In kittens, 50% of neonatal mortalities are the result of stillbirth (incidence of 4.3% to 10.1%), and an additional 25% occur in kittens less than 1 week of age. Approximately 15% of all litters have at least one kitten with one or more congenital anomalies (nearly 10% of kittens born alive). Based on histopathological examination, more than half of the kitten deaths up to 4 months of age are caused by infectious diseases, with the majority having a viral etiology. Before weaning, feline herpesvirus 1 and feline calicivirus are the main causes; after weaning, it is feline parvovirus followed by feline infectious peritonitis (corona)virus. Box 31-1 highlights commonly encountered causes of canine and feline mortality by age group.\n\nIn a large number of cases, a definitive diagnosis is not established, and the cases are released as idiopathic deaths or abortions. In a retrospective study on kitten losses during the first 4 months of life, this apparent failure to identify a specific cause was significantly associated with submission of tissue samples instead of the entire animal to the diagnostic laboratory for postmortem diagnostics. This underlines the fact that a thorough gross examination and collection of a complete set of samples for histopathology and microbiology are imperative to successful postmortem diagnostics. Gross lesions may be subtle and can be easily missed by an inexperienced examiner. This may result in collection of incomplete sample sets, which in turn will limit the spectrum of available diagnostic tests.\n\nEuthanasia of moribund animals should avoid injection into organs or body cavities that are suspected to be involved in the disease process (e.g., intracardiac, intrapulmonary, and intraabdominal injections are not recommended if the disease/syndrome is suspected to be cardiac, pulmonary, and abdominal, respectively). The remains should be immediately refrigerated at 39\u00b0 F (4\u00b0 C). Freezing before collection of samples for histopathology will cause severe artifacts as a result of disruption of the microanatomy by formation of ice crystals and should therefore be avoided. If delays of more than 2 days until a complete postmortem examination are expected, a necropsy at the clinic with collections of a complete set of well-preserved samples is recommended. If in doubt about the appropriate approach, contact a diagnostic pathologist.\n\nThe remains should be allowed to completely cool before packaging into plastic bags or containers for transport or shipping. While in transit, the remains should be chilled with ice packs placed inside the bag or container. Packages have to be absolutely leak-proof and include padding with absorbent material. The remains may be transported to the laboratory by the owner or veterinary practice personnel, or shipped via a carrier service providing same-day or next-day delivery. Shipping of remains late in the week should be avoided as they may end up without adequate cooling over the weekend.\n\nEffective communication with the laboratory personnel, especially the pathologist or case coordinator, is central to successful postmortem diagnostics. The importance of a complete clinical history, including signalment of the animal and clinical findings and diagnoses, cannot be stressed enough. Important points to cover in the clinical history are provided in Box 31-2. Specific questions from the clinician should be noted on the submission sheet, so that the diagnostician is aware of them at the time of gross examination. Submission sheets should be filled out by the attending veterinarian (not by support personnel) to avoid loss of critical information and miscommunication. If the space on the submission sheet BOX 31-1 Common causes of mortality by age group Abortion, Stillbirth, and Perinatal Phase (0 to 1 day) is too limited, the attending veterinarian should include additional pages.\n\nIt may sound trivial, but information needs to be clearly legible because text that cannot be deciphered is of no use. Additional information, like results of recent clinical, pathological, or radiographic examinations, can be very helpful and should be included liberally. If additional material is extensive, a brief summary will be welcomed by the diagnostician. Contact information (telephone and fax numbers, e-mail address) will facilitate timely reporting of results. Many laboratories issue preliminary reports, which should be taken as such: preliminary results without final conclusions. Pet owners may be anxious for results, but some tests take a few days to complete or may not be offered daily. For example, the histopathologic examination of a brain can take up to 10 days from the date of necropsy. In this case, sufficient fixation before processing is necessary to ensure high quality and artifact-free microscopic specimens.\n\nBiosafety and containment are major issues associated with postmortem examinations at a clinic. A designated work area and a separate set of instruments for necropsy reduce risk of contamination of clean and sterile areas. Minimal protective equipment includes gloves, a laboratory coat, and goggles. A disposable plastic apron and a surgical mask (3M, St. Paul, MN; filtering >95% of microorganisms) greatly enhance protection. Aerosolization of pathogens can be decreased by wetting down the animal's haircoat and the work surface. Disinfection with household bleach after thorough cleaning provides sufficient decontamination of surfaces. The subcutis is markedly expanded with edema (anasarca). The abdominal cavity is severely dilated with blood, most likely because of septicemia. Note how the umbilicus has been preserved in this partially skinned puppy. B, Cleft palate (palatoschisis), roof of oral cavity, dog fetus. C, Exencephaly, dorsal aspect of head and neck, dog fetus. The incomplete closure of the crania with protrusion of the brain through the defect in the bone and skin is often associated with cleft palate and other anomalies of the head. D, Bilateral hindlimb deformity and unilateral hydroureter, dog fetus. The abdominal cavity is partially exenterated, and the thoracic cavity is completely exenterated. The left ureter in the upper half of the picture is severely dilated with clear watery fluid (urine).\n\nGetting ready for a necropsy is similar to setting up for surgery. Instruments are set out ahead of time and ideally include the following:\n\n\u2022 Sharp knife and steel (a sharp necropsy or meat knife is the ideal tool for most tasks) \u2022 Scissors (blunt/sharp straight work best) \u2022 Forceps (small dissecting forceps minimize crush artifacts of small tissue samples; tissue thumb 1 \u00d7 2 or 2 \u00d7 3 teeth are fine for larger specimens) \u2022 Rib or poultry shears or branch cutters (for cutting ribs) \u2022 Small bone shears, cutting forceps, or rongeurs (to open skull of kittens and small puppies) \u2022 Stryker saw, hacksaw, or meat cleaver (to open larger skulls)\n\n\u2022 Scalpel blades and handle \u2022 Measuring tape \u2022 Syringes and needles to collect fluids \u2022 Tongue depressors to scrape intestinal mucosa, collect feces, or fix muscle samples Scissors will dull quickly when cutting muscle and skin but are the instrument of choice to open hollow organs. For small animals less than 10 lb, a scalpel with a larger blade works better than a necropsy knife.\n\nSample containers should be kept at hand and ready to use. Please refer to the section on sample collection for further details on appropriate equipment and sampling strategies.\n\nA camera is very helpful to document lesions that are difficult to describe or explain. Printed pictures or digital files A B of photographs can add tremendous value to a submission-\"a picture speaks more than a thousand words.\" Pictures should be well-labeled, and topographic orientation should be provided.\n\nA complete necropsy is the ideal approach if submission of the remains to a diagnostic laboratory cannot be accomplished in a timely or economical manner. There is no one best necropsy protocol. Regardless of the approach, consistency is what matters most. Recognition of lesions, especially absence or displacement of organs, is greatly facilitated by a standardized approach. Suggestions for necropsy procedures with emphasis on the pediatric patient are provided in Box 31-3.\n\nA necropsy protocol provides a standardized approach to the dissection of animals and should be applied consequently. At times, however, it is essential to deviate from the dissection protocol to preserve a lesion, and technical adjustments have to be made. Congenital anomalies are more commonly encountered in the pediatric patient. Their identification can be challenging and often requires careful examination of organs before exenteration.\n\nIn any situation other than an abortion or stillbirth, a partial necropsy is not ideal. Most diseases cause lesions in multiple organs, and important changes may be missed by focusing on a single or a few (potentially incorrectly) selected organs or systems. A common scenario is failure to examine and collect the brain from a patient with a history of vague clinical symptoms or even seizures. However, a complete necropsy is not always an option, and a partial necropsy may provide at least some answers.\n\nIn case of abortions or stillbirth, the primary concern is the collection of samples without cross-contamination. Sampling is done first and is followed by a close examination of organs and tissues in situ (before exenteration) as it facilitates identification of common anatomic congenital anomalies like aplasia, hypoplasia, and heterotopia.\n\nBasic sample containers include large and tightly shutting plastic jars filled halfway with formalin for histopathological samples, sterile and sealable plastic bags for fresh samples, red-top Vacutainer tubes (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) for safe transport of fluids, and culture swabs. Containers need to be labeled with the owner's name and animal identification. Those containers holding fresh samples should also state the content.\n\nFor histopathology, tissue samples are fixed in 10% formalin (3.4% formaldehyde) at a tissue/formalin ratio of\n\nA necropsy entails three basic tasks: 1. External examination 2. Exenteration of organs 3. Examination of internal organs and body parts A list with the structures examined during a complete necropsy is given in Figure 31 -9. For a more detailed necropsy protocol, see the suggested reading at the end of the chapter. \n\nThis is a bit time consuming but essential if the animal showed nervous signs.\n\n1. Move head slightly up and down to locate atlantooccipital joint, disarticulate from ventral aspect, and transect spinal cord. 2. Skin head from occiput to cranial of eyes. 3. As long as bones are soft, use scissors to open skull from occipital foramen to a line connecting the caudal canthus of both eyes, and peel off crania. Otherwise, use Stryker saw, hacksaw, or meat cleaver to generate same trapezoid cut, and lift off crania. 4. Cut dura mater with scissors to expose brain, and turn head upside down. Gravity will pull brain away from base of skull. 5. Transect cranial nerves and olfactory bulbs with scissors, and let brain slide out into palm of hand. 6. Samples for microbiology may include: small pieces of brainstem, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex; cerebrospinal fluid; swab from ventricle and/or meninges.\n\n7. Place brain in tenfold volume of formalin to fix for histopathology. 8. Check tympanic bullae at base of skull by nipping open with bone cutter. 9. Sagittally cut through nose to open nasal cavity, and remove septum. Alternatively, cut nose transversely behind canine teeth. 10. Enucleate eyes if examination is desired, and fix whole.\n\nSpinal Cord:\n\n1. Cut off limbs, rib, and pelvis. 2. Flesh out vertebral column. 3. With bone cutters, cut dorsal arch on each side of vertebrae, and reflect dorsally and back to remove. Once spinal cord is completely exposed, grasp dura mater with forceps, and gently lift out by cutting nerves and attachments as needed with scissors (leave nerve rootlets and ganglia attached). 4. Open dura mater dorsally along entire length, and fix spinal cord (ideally flat) in large tub with formalin.\n\nLabel paper towel or tongue depressor with pencil or permanent marker, and place tissue (mucosa facing up) on it. Fold paper towel over, and immerse in formalin by squeezing out air. Alternatively, place tissues in separate, labeled containers.\n\n1 : 10. In cool climates, addition of 10% to 15% methanol will prevent frost damage of fixed tissues. In very cold climates (temperatures well below freezing), tissues may be shipped in 60% ethylene glycol in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in formalin on arrival at the laboratory as long as cooling is guaranteed during transport. The thickness of tissue sections should not exceed 5 mm ( 1 4 inch) to allow for rapid and complete penetration and fixation. Fresh samples should be collected from areas with visible lesions. Contamination of other tissues or handling of samples with contaminated instruments should be avoided. Samples for microbiology require immediate refrigeration or cooling (blue ice). Samples for bacteriology, virology, and toxicology may be sent frozen. Freezing of samples for parasitology and mycology should be avoided as it destroys organisms. Swabs for virology and bacteriology have different requirements for transport media (addition or omission of antimicrobials, respectively).\n\nFetal and perinatal losses warrant aggressive diagnostics to prevent recurrence of problems in subsequent breeding cycles. Some diagnostic laboratories offer discounts on testing in the form of abortion screens, which include but are not limited to pathology and microbiology. An example of a sampling checklist for abortions is provided in Figure  31 -7 (please feel free to photocopy for use in practice). Inclusion of the placenta for both histopathology and microbiological testing is very helpful.\n\nA thorough physical examination of the dam is recommended and may be supplemented with hormonal assays and karyotyping of fetal or placental tissue. The perinatal phase is an extension of gestation and parturition, and neonatal losses within the first 24 hours postpartum should be worked up as an abortion. Nonetheless, a thorough and complete gross examination is recommended for puppies and kittens in this age group.\n\nA datasheet for recording of necropsy findings and a sample checklist are provided in Figures 31-8 and 31-9, respectively (please feel free to photocopy for use in practice). The age and clinical presentation of the animal and the necropsy findings determine the most appropriate panel of samples for a diagnostic workup. The sampling checklist provided covers three scenarios frequently encountered in the pediatric patient: respiratory, gastrointestinal, and systemic (infectious) diseases. Submission of a complete set of tissue samples for histopathology is highly recommended for all disease processes. Many laboratories charge a standard fee for histopathology on necropsies regardless of the number of tissues included; subsequently, the more the better for yielding a diagnosis at no additional expense for the client.\n\nTissue samples collected for histopathology should be no thicker than 5 mm ( 1 4 inch). Samples of the heart include longitudinal sections taken from the left and right ventricle, ideally the papillary muscles, and a thin crosssection through the septum. In case of organs with multiple anatomic subunits like the kidney, adrenal gland, or testis, it is important to obtain a sample that includes all components (in the case of the kidney, these are cortex, medulla, and pelvis). Collection of multiple samples is also recommended for multilobar organs like the liver and lungs. In the case of paired organs, a sample from each side is helpful. Hollow organs like the stomach, intestines, and urinary bladder are opened up to expose the mucosa to the fixative. Hollow organs with a diameter of less than 3 mm, like the intestines of neonatal patients or ureters, can be gently filled with\n\nWrapping of samples smaller than 5 mm in diameter in a paper towel reduces the risk of loss during processing. Identification of individual samples can be accomplished by submission in separate, labeled containers or wrapped in a paper towel clearly labeled with pencil, roller ball, or permanent marker and added to the remaining fixed samples.\n\nformalin using a syringe and needle and left unopened. The nervous system and special senses should be fixed intact. After enucleation, it is best to gently inject formalin into the posterior chamber of the globe to speed up fixation. Bone marrow cores may be fixed in formalin for histopathology and/or rolled out on glass slides and air dried for cytology. "}
