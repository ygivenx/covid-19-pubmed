{"title": "3.28 Microbial Lectins", "body": "Viruses contain sugar-specific surface proteins or glycoproteins that act as hemagglutinins and are therefore classified as lectins ( Table 1) . These lectins are structurally diverse and no common features can be discerned. Detailed information based largely on X-ray crystallography is available on the interaction with carbohydrates of influenza virus hemagglutinins. Complexes with ligands of the hemagglutinins of rotavirus, polyoma virus, and foot-and-mouth virus have also been well studied by the same technique. No other viral lectins have however been similarly characterized.\n\nInfluenza A and B virions are studded with two different types of spikes, the hemagglutinin (HA), specific for N-acetylneuraminic acid that mediates receptor binding and pH-dependent membrane fusion and the neuraminidase (correct name, 'sialidase'), originally known as the viral receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE). In contrast, influenza C virus possesses only one type of spike, specific for 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid, which combines all three functions, and is commonly referred to as the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion protein (HEF). Influenza virus A is attracting much interest because an understanding of the structural determinants and molecular mechanisms involved in its binding to human cell receptors is central to the identification of viruses that pose a pandemic threat (see Chapter 4.25) .\n\nThe receptors recognized by influenza virus are sialic acids of cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids. Sialic acids are usually found in either a2-3 or a2-6 linkages to galactose, the predominant penultimate sugar of N-linked carbohydrate side chains. The binding preference of a given HA for one or the other of these linkages correlates with the species specificity of the virus. 22, 23 Thus, the HAs of all 15 antigenic subtypes found in avian influenza A and B viruses bind preferentially to sialic acid in a2-3 linkage, and it is this form of the sialosaccharide that predominates in avian enteric tracts where these viruses replicate. Swine influenza viruses bind sialic acid in a2-6 and sometimes also a2-3 linkages, and sialic acid in both linkages is detected in porcine tracheae. Human viruses of the H1, H2, and H3 subtypes that are known to have caused pandemics in 1918, 1957, and 1968 , respectively, recognize 2-6-linked sialic acid, the major form found on cells of the human respiratory tract, and are now the focus of intense attention.\n\nThis is the most thoroughly investigated viral lectin. 23, 24 Its subunit is composed of two polypeptides, HA1 and HA2, m.w. 36 and 26kDa, respectively, covalently linked by a single disulfide bond 22 (Figure 1) . The hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein, with six N-linked oligosaccharides attached to HA1 and one to HA2. One of these glycans is an oligomannoside, while the others are complex bi-or triantennary structures, several of which contain sulfated galactose. X-ray crystallography showed that the hemagglutinin subunit consists of a hydrophilic, C-terminal domain, a hydrophobic membrane spanning region of 24-28 residues, an elongated triple-helical coiled stem, and a globular domain projecting 135\u00c5 from the membrane. The globular domain consists of HA1 only, and contains the carbohydrate-binding site of the lectin. The subunits associate noncovalently to form trimers. The affinity of the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus for its receptor is downregulated by the two N-linked oligosaccharides attached to Asn123 and Asn129 in the vicinity of the combining site. 25 Thus, a mutant hemagglutinin devoid of these oligosaccharides bound to human erythrocytes much more strongly than the native lectin.\n\nTo date, crystal structures of several human, avian, and swine influenza hemagglutinins, mostly in complexes with the trisaccharide Neu5Aca6Galb4Glc (Sia2-6Lac) or Neu5Aca3Galb4Glc (Sia2-3Lac) and the pentasaccharide Neu5Aca6Galb4GlcNAcb3GalbGlc (LSTc) or Neu5Aca3Galb4GlcNAcb3Galb4Glc (LSTa), analogs of the Neu5Aca2-6-and Neu5Aca2-3-human and avian receptors, respectively, have been determined. A complete description of all the structures obtained is beyond the scope of this chapter. Here, only selective examples will be given of the structures of HAs and how they interact with the corresponding ligands.\n\nEarly sequence studies have shown that for the HAs of the H2 and H3 human viruses, a minimum of two changes in receptor-binding site amino acids, Gln226 to Leu226 and Gly228 to Ser228, correlate with the shift from avian to human receptor binding. 26 By contrast, HAs of human H1 viruses acquire the ability to bind to human receptors while retaining Gln226 and Gly228. An understanding of how these changes occur, and a better insight into the combining sites of the HAs, have been provided by the recent study of John Skehel and co-workers of the structures of HAs from the 1918 pandemic virus (1918-human) with the use of HA expressed from the DNA recovered from tissues infected with virus in 1918 and from the prototype human (1934-human) and swine (1930-swine) H1 influenza viruses. 27 Overall structure and receptor binding subdomain. The overall trimeric structures of the HAs of the three H1 viruses (1918-human, 1934-human, and 1930-swine) HAs are similar ( Figure 2 ), but they show notable differences to HAs of other subtypes with respect to the arrangements of the receptor-binding subdomain among others, both within the HA trimer and also within individual monomers. The receptor-binding sites are located as in other influenza A virus HAs at the membrane-distal tip of each subunit of the HA trimer. Three secondary structure elements, the 190 helix (residues 190-198) , the 130 loop (residues 135-138), and the 220 loop (residues 221-228), form the sides of each site, with the base made up of the conserved residues Tyr98, Trp153, His183, and Tyr195. The conformations adopted by the 130 and 220 loops of the three H1 HAs are similar, but they are significantly different from those of the equivalent loops in the HAs of other influenza subtypes (Figures 2b, 3, and 4 ). As observed with other HAs, the terminal sialic acids of the human and avian receptors interact with binding site residues through a series of conserved hydrogen bonds to the carboxyl and amide of the sialic acid ( Figure 3) . The 1934-human HA/human receptor complex. The electron density maps reveal well-ordered features for the Sia-1, Gal-2, and GlcNAc-3 of the sialopentasaccharide (the numbers in bold refer to the positions of the monosaccharides in the ligand) in this complex (Figure 3a) . Gal-2 forms five hydrogen bonds that have not been previously observed in other HA/receptor complexes. Four bonds are possible between the 2-and 3-hydroxyls of Gal-2 and the side chains of Lys222 and Asp225, and a fifth between the 4-hydroxyl of Gal-2 and the main-chain amide of 227 that is mediated by a water molecule.\n\nThe 1934-human HA/avian receptor complex. Again, only the Sia-1, Gal-2, and GlcNAc-3 moieties of the sialopentasaccharide are ordered in this complex (Figure 3b ). This observation is consistent with the results of hemagglutination assays showing dual binding specificity for this HA. The side-chain carbonyl of Gln226 forms a hydrogen bond with the 4-hydroxyl of Gal-2, as observed in other HA/avian receptor complexes. In addition, there is a previously unknown water-mediated interaction between the 4-hydroxyl of Gal-2, the main-chain carbonyl of residue 225, and the side chain of Lys222 (Figure 3b ). The 1930-swine HA/human receptor complex. The sialic acid of the receptor is located similarly in the 1930-swine and 1934-human HA receptor binding sites, but in the 1930 swine complex all five saccharides of the receptor analog are detected ( Figure 3c ). Lys222 again forms hydrogen bonds with the 2-and 3-hydroxyls of Gal-2, although in the present case this residue sits higher in the binding site. Asp190 hydrogen bonds to the amino nitrogen of GlcNAc-3, Ser193 hydrogen bonds to the 2-hydroxyl of Gal-4, and there is a water-mediated interaction between Thr189 and GlcNAc-5. The last three interactions have not been observed before in HA receptor complexes. In addition, the sialopentasaccharide exits the binding site in an orientation not previously seen, crossing the 190 helix near its N-terminus, about parallel to the threefold symmetry axis of the HA trimer.\n\nThe 1930-swine HA/avian receptor complex. The electron density for the avian receptor analog bound to the 1930swine HA is weak and mainly represents the sialic acid moiety (Figure 3d) . A similar situation was observed for an H5 avian HA in complex with a human receptor analog, where only a subset of the atoms for the sialic acid could be located. These observations probably reflect the low affinity of the HAs for their respective ligands, consistent with the preference of the 1930-swine virus for human receptor in hemagglutination assays. Human receptor complexes. Complexes of the human receptor analog bound to 1934-human HA (green) and 1930swine HA (blue) and to human H3 HA (red) are superimposed in Figure 4a . Perhaps the most important feature of this comparison is the difference in structure adopted by the 130 and 220 loops of the receptor-binding site between Figure 3 Interactions of 1934-human HA (top) and 1930-swine HA (bottom) with human receptor and with avian receptor analogs. The view of the receptor binding site is about the same as in Figure 2b . The three secondary structure components of the binding site are labeled in this backbone representation together with some of the most relevant side chains. The broken lines indicate potential hydrogen bond interactions between the protein and the receptors; residues making interactions via main-chain carbonyl groups are shown as red spheres, whereas those interacting via main-chain nitrogens are shown as blue spheres. In all four panels, the sialosaccharides are colored yellow for carbon atoms, blue for nitrogen, and red for oxygen. the H1 and H3 HAs. One consequence of the change in the 130-loop structure is that the sialic acid of the receptor is tilted about 10 into the receptor-binding sites of the H1 HAs. This effect, together with different orientations about the glycosidic bond, contributes to Gal-2 being located almost 2\u00c5 lower in the H1 HAs than in the human H3 HAs. Gal-2 is able to adopt this position because structural differences in the 220 loop locate Gln226 lower in the binding site than the equivalent Leu226 of human H3 HA. Consequently, in the H1 HAs, Gal-2 is located closer to the 220 loop and is able to form hydrogen bonds with Lys222. In the case of the 1934-human HA, Gal-2 also interacts with Asp225. Thus, a combination of factors relating to the structure of the 130 and 220 loops enable the H1 HAs to make favorable hydrogen bond interactions with Gal-2 of the human receptor. Gln226 plays an essentially passive role in this process, in marked contrast to the role played by Leu226 in the binding of human H3 HA to human receptor. In that case, Gal-2 makes hydrophobic contacts with Leu226, and the higher position and the nature of this side chain are important for human receptor binding. Avian receptor complexes. Complexes of avian receptor analogs with 1934-human HA (green), 1930-swine HA (blue), and an avian H3 HA (red) are overlaid in Figure 4b . Again, the differences in the structure of the 130 loop between the H1 and H3 HAs result in the sialic acid of the avian receptor being located lower in the receptor binding site of the H1 HAs. Comparison of the 1934-human and avian H3 complexes also reveals that Gal-2 of the avian receptor is located about 1\u00c5 lower in the binding site of the H1 complex, as is Gln226. In both complexes, the 4-hydroxyl of Gal-2 hydrogen bonds with the side-chain carbonyl of Gln226 (Figure 4b) , and the coordinated differences in position of the bound receptor and Gln226 enable this interaction to be conserved. It seems therefore that the 1934-human HA is able to bind the avian receptor in a manner reminiscent of avian HAs, with Gln226 playing a key role.\n\nThe above data for the different complexes show the overall structures of 1930-swine and 1934-human HA receptorbinding sites are very similar (Figure 2b) , and that both contain a glutamine residue at position 226. It has been suggested that the 1930-swine HA binds less effectively to avian receptors than the 1934-human HA because the position adopted by Gln226 in 1934-human HA is about 1\u00c5 higher in its complex with the avian receptor than it is either in the human receptor complex or in the uncomplexed form ( Figure 5 ). By contrast, the position of Gln226 in 1930-swine HA is about the same as uncomplexed and in the human and avian receptor complexes. The apparent inability of Gln226 to adopt a higher position in the receptor-binding site seems to explain the failure of 1930-swine HA to interact as effectively with the avian receptor. This explanation is supported by the structural observation that in the 1934-human HA complex with avian receptor Glu190 interacts through two water molecules with Gln226 ( Figure 5 ). This network of hydrogen bonds may be necessary to position Gln226 in the binding site for its interaction with Gal-2. Glu190 is conserved in avian H1 HAs, all of which specifically bind a2-3-linked receptors. By contrast, residue 190 of 1930-swine HA is an aspartic acid, which does not interact with either the 9-hydroxyl of Sia-1 or Gln226 and is thus unable to facilitate binding to avian receptor. Irrespective of the single amino acid difference of Asp or Gly at residue 225 between the sequences of 1918-human HAs, by recognizing human receptors, all would fulfill the first requirement of an epidemic virus: the ability to spread in the human population. The importance of this requirement was emphasized in the 1997 outbreak of H5 'chicken' influenza in Hong Kong, when the virus was extremely virulent but did not acquire the ability to bind 2-6-linked sialosides and was therefore unable to spread. With the ability to ensure the efficiency of the initial stages of virus infection, coupled with novel antigenicity, the human-1918 HA may have been the prime determinant of extensive mortality in the 1918 pandemic.\n\nPrevious crystallographic analysis of the trisaccharide human receptor analog, Sia2-6Lac, bound to human H3 HA, revealed an extended conformation 24 rather than the folded conformation of the pentasaccharide human receptor analog, LSTa. This conformation was presumed not to be representative of natural receptors because of the presence of glucose rather than N-acetylglucosamine at position 3 and the lack of glycosylation beyond this position. The mode of Sia2-6Lac binding, however, further demonstrates the plasticity of the HA receptor binding site in accommodating oligosaccharides in different conformations. By contrast, Sia2-6Lac binds in a manner very similar to that of the pentasaccharide, LSTa, again suggesting that there is no role in avian receptor binding for the saccharides beyond GlcNAc-3. It is therefore possible that some avian HAs are capable of binding sialic acid in a2-6 linkage to galactose, but are not capable of infecting humans because the saccharides beyond GlcNAc-3 sterically clash with the HA. For an avian HA to change its binding specificity from avian to human receptors may therefore involve two sorts of changes, the first, to allow binding of the a2-6-linkage, either via mutation of Gln226 to Leu226 as in H2 and H3 HAs or via a specific positioning of Gln226 as in H1, and the second, to accommodate the additional saccharides linked to Gal-2 in the natural receptor side chain. \n\nLike its homologous influenza A and B virus hemagglutinins, to which it bears limited primary sequence identity, HEF is a homotrimer of an N-glycosylated type I membrane glycoprotein. It consists of a 65kDa N-terminal subunit HEF1 and a 30kDa C-terminal subunit HEF2 that is membrane anchored. Despite an overall primary sequence identity of only 11%, the similarity between the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of HEF and the hemagglutinin is astounding ( Figure 6 ). 16, 28, 29 The main differences are within the N-terminal subunits, which form the globular part of the spikes and which, in the case of HEF, contain the receptor-binding R and RDE esterase domains. The C-terminal HEF2 subunit, together with segments of HEF1, comprises the fusion domain F. In the trimer, HEF2 subunits constitute the elongated membrane-anchored stalk, at the core of which long central helices form a triple-stranded interphase. Each HEF1 subunit contains two sites that can accommodate Neu5,9Ac 2 . The actual receptor-binding sites are cavities at the tip of the globular head domain with Tyr127, Thr170, and Gly172 involved in ligand binding. Interaction with the 9-O-acetyl group, the most critical determinant for receptor recognition, is mediated among others by the hydroxyl group of Tyr224 and the guanido group of Arg236, which contact the acetyl carbonyl oxygen. Moreover, Phe225, Phe293, and Pro271 form a nonpolar pocket into which the acetyl methyl group can be fitted ( Figure 7) . The importance of the latter site for receptor recognition is underlined by the observations that mutations of residues adjacent to Pro271 (Asp269Asn, Thr270Leu or Ile, and Thr272Ile) are associated with increased binding efficiency to Neu5,9Ac 2 receptors.\n\nThe rotavirus hemagglutinin binds the alpha anomer of N-acetylneuraminic acid with an association constant (K a ) of 8\u00c210 5 M -1 . It requires no additional carbohydrate moiety for binding to the sialic acid, does not distinguish between 3 0 and 6 0 sialyllactose, and has approximately 10-fold lower affinity for N-glycolylneuraminic acid than for N-acetylneuraminic acid. 30 The rotavirus outer capsid is made of the coat glycoprotein VP7 and the spike protein VP4. Trypsin cleaves VP4 into an N-terminal fragment, VP8*, consisting of amino acids 46-231, that contains the viral hemagglutinin (residues 93-208) and a C-terminal fragment, VP5*, the function of which is to permeabilize the membrane to which the virus binds. No crystals of free VP8* could be obtained, but it crystallized in complex with methyl a-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid. NMR analyses of VP8* in solution, and X-ray studies of its complex with the above ligand, revealed the same basic protein structure. 31 It is a single, compactly folded globular domain with two cysteines (C203 and C216) and two prolines (P68 and P182) in the cis-configuration. The crystals contain a mixture of molecules with the peptide bond G156-P157 in either the cis-or trans-configuration.\n\nThe tight fold of the b-sandwich, the cross-bracing of the b-sheets by the b-ribbon and the C-terminal a-helix, the short loops between the strands and the dense hydrophobic cores between the major structural elements all suggest a compact, rigid structure, that accounts for the protease resistance and stability of the VP8* core ( Figure 8 ). The b-sandwich of the rotavirus sialic acid binding domain has the same fold as the S-carbohydrate recognition domain (S-CRD) of the galectins, despite the absence of a significant sequence similarity between the two (9% identity with human galectin-3 in structurally equivalent residues).\n\nThe sialic acid-binding site of the rhesus rotavirus hemagglutinin lies above the cleft between the two b-sheets and appears to be an open-ended, shallow groove. Of the four amino acids (Arg101, Tyr155, Tyr188, and Ser190) seen to be involved in sialic acid binding, the last three were previously identified as likely ligand-binding residues by mutagenesis studies. In addition to the seven hydrogen bonds (Figure 9 ), the sialic acid makes several van der Waals contacts with the side chains of six amino acids, three of which are tyrosines.\n\nThis virus is a nonenveloped, icosahedrically symmetrical particle, with a circular, double-stranded DNA genome. 32 Its carbohydrate binding site is located in viral protein 1 (VP1, m.w. c. 42kDa), the major constituent of the outer shell (capsid) of the virion. Each virion contains 360 copies of VP1, arranged in pentamers. VP1 has two antiparallel b-sheets with a topology that resembles the jellyroll fold; some loops that connect the b-strands are extensive and contain additional secondary structural elements ( Figure 10 ). The most striking feature of the capsid is the way the individual pentamers are tied together by the C-terminal arms of the monomers; the last 63 residues emerge from each monomer and protrude into a subunit of another pentamer, where they form a b-strand that augments a sheet in the target subunit.\n\nTwo types of strain of murine polyoma virus are known that differ in their tumorogenicity in mice and in their specificity for sialic acid oligosaccharides. The critical difference in the structure of the viral protein (VP1) that contains the carbohydrate-binding site of these strains is in residue 91, which is glycine in the poorly tumorogenic strains and glutamic acid in the highly tumorogenic ones. 33 Crystallographic studies at low resolution of the intact poorly tumorogenic virus particle in complex with Sia2-3Lac 34 and with a branched hexasaccharide containing both a2-3and a2-6-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid 35, 36 have located the combining site in a shallow groove and have \n\nY188 shown that the sialic acid as well as the galactose form contacts with the protein (Figure 11 ). The inability of the highly tumorogenic strains to bind the branched ligand is due to electrostatic repulsion between the side chain of Glu91 and the carboxylate of the a2-6-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid. These results have been confirmed and extended in a high-resolution crystallographic study of a pentamer of VP1 from the poorly tumorogenic virus in complex with the above pentasaccharide. 32 \n\nThis virus has the basic picornavirus structure ( Figure 12 ). Its icosahedral capsid comprises 60 copies each of four virus-encoded proteins, VP1-VP4. X-ray crystallography of the complex of the virus with its ligand, heparin, revealed that the combining site is located in a shallow depression on its surface, consists of contributions from the three major capsid proteins, VP1, VP2 and VP3 and is located at the junction of these proteins. VP1, VP2, and VP3, virtually identical for the type A and O viruses. 37, 38 There were virtually no changes in the protein to accommodate the sugar. In the complex with a sulfated heparin trisaccharide HSO 3 6GlcNH(HSO 3 \n\n, the key binding residue was Arg56 of VP3, which interacts ionically with two of the sulfates of the trisaccharide. The importance of this residue is supported by the finding that field isolates of the virus, where the arginine is replaced by histidine, do not bind heparin. Additionally, nonionic interactions observed in the virus-ligand complex include bonds between His195 of VP1 and the iduronic acid, and a stacking interaction between the imidazole ring of this amino acid and the hydrophobic face of the glucosamine that follows the iduronic acid. 38 In strain O 1 BFS, the most tightly bound heparin residues were GlcN2, Ido3, and GlcN4, and, for A10 61 , these were the only ones for which there was clear electron density.\n\nThe ligands were the basic and polar residues Arg56 and Asn88 of VP3, Thr134 and Arg135 of VP2, and Lys193 of VP1, and bridging water molecules were important ( Figure 13b ). As for virus strain O 1 BFS, there was no direct involvement of the VP1 C-terminal residues 200RHKQI205 in binding; however, the neighboring residues His195 (O 1 BFS) ( Figure 4b) and Lys-193 (A10 61 ) of VP1 (Figure 13a ) did contact the heparan substrate (HS), and the C-terminus may stabilize these residues in a suitable position for HS binding. Two ligating residues were conserved between the type A and O complexes: Arg-56 of VP3 and Arg-135 of VP2 (Figures 13a and 13b) . The former switches from a histidine to an arginine in type O viruses on adaptation to tissue culture and is a key ligand in both complexes. In the O 1 BFS complex, it acts as a bidentate ligand, stabilizing sulfate groups from rings 2 and 4, whereas in the A10 61 complex, it only interacts with ring 4. Arg-135 makes a hydrophobic interaction in both complexes and appears to polarize Asn-88 of VP3, increasing its affinity for HSO 3 -6-NH-SO 3 .\n\nA variety of bacterial species and genera express surface lectins, frequently of more than one type and with distinct specificities 2,3,39 ( specificities of most of the surface lectins are among the factors determining the organ and animal tropism of the bacteria. It is not known whether individual cells co-express multiple lectins or if each lectin is confined to a distinct cell subpopulation of the species. We know, however, that the expression of the surface lectins is commonly regulated by a mechanism known as phase variation, that controls the back-and-forth conversion of the lectin-expressing cells in a bacterial population to nonexpressing ones. 40 In Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella spp., the lectins often are in the form of submicroscopic hair-like appendages, named fimbriae or pili, that protrude from the surface of the cells. During the fimbriated phase, a typical Gram-negative bacterium carries 200-500 peritrichously arranged fimbriae.\n\nThe most prevalent and best characterized bacterial surface lectins with respect to structure, biosynthesis, and function are those expressed by E. coli, namely the mannose-specific type 1 fimbriae, the galabiose-specific P fimbriae, and the N-acetylglucosamine-specific F17 fimbriae. They all consist of an assembly of different classes of subunit and belong to the family of flexible 'Cup' fimbriae, referred to as such because they are assembled by the chaperone/usher pathway. 41 The carbohydrate-binding subunit is typically located at the end of the assembled structure.\n\nType 1 fimbriae (Figures 14 and 15 ) are expressed by a large number of E. coli strains, and are found in more than 95% of E. coli isolates from intestinal and extraintestinal infections such as urinary ones. 1, 3, 39, 42 They are also produced by other enterobacterial species, among them of K. pneumoniae, Salmonella typhimurium, and Salmonella enteritidis. The affinity of different phenotypes of E. coli type 1 or of the isolated fimbriae to mannose or MeaMan may differ within a factor of 15 and they can be functionally subdivided into either low-mannose-binding (M1L) or high-mannosebinding (M1H) phenotypes. 43 E. coli exhibiting these two basic phenotypes have been found to predominate in different niches. Most isolates from the large intestine of healthy humans (c. 80%) express a distinct M1L phenotype, whereas most isolates from urinary tract infections (>70%) express M1H variants. These naturally occurring variations dramatically change the tissue tropism of E. coli and can be a major factor in shifting the bacterial adaptation from commensal to pathologic habitats, a phenomenon known as pathoadaptation. 44 Typically, type 1 fimbriae of E. coli have a considerably higher affinity (up to 40 times as compared to mannose) for oligosaccharides such as Mana3-Manb4GlcNAc or Mana6(Mana3)Mana6(Mana3)Man that are constituents of cell surface glycoproteins. 45 In the urinary tract, the fimbriae mediate binding of the bacteria to the oligomannosides Man 9 GlcNAc 2 to Man 6 GlcNAc 2 of uroplakin Ia, a major glycoprotein of urothelial apical plaques. 46, 47 Anchorage of E. coli to the urothelial surface via type 1 fimbriae-uroplakin I interactions may play a role in their colonization of the bladder and eventual ascent through the ureters, against urine flow, to invade the kidneys.\n\nStructurally, the fimbriae are 1-2mm long and 7nm thick fibers, that are rod like, made up largely of repeating immunoglobulin-like FimA subunits (m.w. 17kDa) arranged helically in a structure referred to as 'shaft' (Figure 16) . 48, 49 The shaft is joined to a short 3nm thick distal tip fibrillum that consists of two adapter proteins, FimF and FimG, and a third of a different kind, FimH (m.w. 29-31kDa). The latter is the only subunit that possesses a carbohydrate-binding site and is thus responsible for the sugar-binding activity of the fimbriae. 50 FimH is also present in small numbers at intervals along the fimbrial filament, but only the subunit at the tip appears to be able to mediate mannose-specific adhesive interactions, whereas the subunits at the other positions are inaccessible to the carbohydrate ligand. 51 Minor sequence variations in FimH alleles from different clinical isolates have been shown to correlate with altered carbohydrate-binding profiles of the fimbriae. 44 The FimH subunits of E. coli and K. pneumoniae are 88% homologous. Still, the two organisms differ in their fine specificity, for example, in their relative affinity for Mana3Manb4GlcNAc and p-nitrophenyl a-mannoside. [52] [53] [54] Other aromatic a-mannosides are also high-affinity ligands (up to 1000 times stronger than MeaMan) for E. coli type 1, suggesting the presence of a hydrophobic binding region next to the monosaccharide-combining site of FimH. With several Salmonella species examined, aromatic a-mannosides, as well as the trisaccharide Mana2Manb4GlcNAc, were weaker inhibitors than MeaMan. The combining site of Salmonella species appears thus to be smaller than that of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and to be devoid of an adjoining hydrophobic region. Different combining sites were found in other mannose-specific bacterial lectins. Therefore, although classified together on the basis of their monosaccharide (primary) specificity, these lectins differ in their fine specificity. Swapping experiments with genetically engineered hybrid fimbriae, in which the FimH of one species (e.g., E. coli) was presented on the shaft of the other species (K. pneumoniae), have shown that the shaft plays a role in modulating the specificity of fimbriae, probably by imposing conformational constraints on the carbohydrate-binding subunit. 55 The first 3-D structure of a fimbrial carbohydrate-binding subunit to be solved was that of FimH in complex with the FimC chaperone (see below) to which the mannose analog cyclohexylbutanoyl-N-hydroxyethyl-D-glucamide was bound. 56 FimH is seen folded into two all-b class domains connected by a short extended linker ( Figure 17 ). One of these, located in the N-terminal half of the subunit (residues 1-156), is the lectin domain, with the mannose-binding site at its tip. The C-terminal half (residues 160-279), known as the pilin domain, serves to anchor the subunit to the fimbriae. It binds in the cleft of FimC, although there is only limited contact between FimH and the C-terminal domain of the chaperone. The carbohydrate recognition domain of FimH is an 11-stranded elongated b-barrel with a jellyroll-like topology, while the pilin domain has an immunoglobulin fold that lacks the seventh (C-terminal) b-strand present in the canonical immunoglobulin fold. In the FimC-FimH complex, the missing b-strand is donated by the seventh strand of the N-terminal domain of the chaperone to complete the immunoglobulin-like fold of FimH. This kind of 'donor strand complementation' is thought to initiate folding of FimH directly on the chaperone, thus accounting for the function of the latter in biogenesis of the fimbriae. 57 The 3-D structure of the FimC-FimH in complex with bound mannose has also been elucidated by X-ray crystallography. 58 Although mannose exists in solution as a mixture of aand b-anomers, only the former was found in the crystal (Figure 18 ). It is buried at a deep and negatively charged site at the edge of FimH, opposite to the region through which the latter combines with the chaperone. All the mannose hydroxyls, except the anomeric one, interacted extensively with combining site residues, almost all of which are situated at the ends of b-strands or in the loops extending from them. Part of the hydrogen-bonding network is identical to that found in mannose complexes of other lectins. Thus, Asp54 makes cooperative hydrogen bonds with the 4-and 6-OH and Asn140 with the 3-and 4-OH of the ligand, similar to those made by the equivalent residues with the same sugar in the combining sites of legume lectins with the same primary specificity. 59 In addition, the N-terminal amine of the FimH polypeptide is H-bonded to the 2-OH, 6-OH, and the ring oxygen of the mannose. 58 This is one of the rare cases in which an N-terminal amine of a protein participates in ligand binding. Phe142 of FimH interacts hydrophobically with the C2-C3 bond of the mannose. The same residue, together with Ile13, Tyr 48, and Ile52, form part of a hydrophobic ridge that surrounds the site and which may help to direct the ligand into it. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that combining site residues Asp54, Gln133, Asn135, and Asp140 are essential for carbohydrate binding by FimH, since their replacement by alanine, asparagine, or aspartic acid resulted in complete loss of this activity.\n\nExamination of the binding site region of FimH has provided confirmation of the suggestion, made some two decades ago, that the combining site of this lectin is extended, and fits best mannose-containing trisaccharides such as Mana3Manb4GlcNAc or Mana6(Mana3)Man. 45 X-ray crystallography and modeling studies of the complexes of FimH with hydrophobic mannosides 60 have furnished a molecular explanation for the high affinity of type 1 fimbriae to such compounds ( Figure 19 ). It is likely that the hydrophobic character of the ridge of the mannose-binding site of FimH distinguishes E. coli type 1 fimbriae from those of Salmonella species that neither exhibit an increased affinity for mannose with hydrophobic substituents nor for the oligomannosides mentioned earlier. Nearly all mutations in the combining site of FimH abolished or decreased its binding not only to mannose, but also to urinary epithelial cells, indicating that the site may be highly conserved. 44, 61 Support for this conclusion comes from the finding that there are very few variations in the sequences of the mannose-binding site of over 200 uropathogenic strains of E. coli examined, in contrast to enterohemorrhagic strains of E. coli, in which there are sequence variations at this site. 61 On the other hand, replacement of residues 185-279 within the FimH pilin domain with a corresponding segment of the type 1C fimbrial subunit FocH has led to a loss of the multivalent mannotriose-specific binding property accompanied by the acquisition of a distinct mannose-specific (i.e., monovalent, M1H) binding capability. Bacteria expressing the monovalent hybrid FimH were capable of binding strongly to uroepithelial tissue culture cells and guinea pig erythrocytes. They could not, however, agglutinate yeasts or bind human buccal cells, functions readily accomplished by the E. coli expressing mannotriose-specific FimH variants. Based on the relative potency of inhibitory compounds of different structures, it was concluded that the receptor-binding site within the monovalent FimH-FocH subunit has an extended structure with an overall configuration similar to that within the multivalent FimH of natural origin. Another class of high-affinity ligand for type 1 fimbriated E. coli are mannose-derived neoglycoproteins and dendrimers (see Chapter 3.23 ). 61a The former are proteins to which varying numbers of a-mannose residues are covalently attached, while the latter are multifunctional spherical branched polymers of well-defined molecular size that carry large numbers of such residues on their surface.\n\nIn contrast to type 1 E. coli, that recognize structures present only in glycoproteins, P-fimbriated E. coli are specific for galabiose (Gala4Gal), a structure found in glycoproteins (see Chapter 3.14) as well as in membrane glycosphingolipids of the globo-series. [62] [63] [64] These bacteria bind the disaccharide when it is present either at the nonreducing position or at an internal one of such glycolipids. They adhere mainly to the upper part of the kidney, where galabiose is more abundant. P fimbriae are similar to type 1 fimbriae in that they too are composite structures consisting of a long, rigid rod and a short, flexible, open helical part ( Figure 20) . The rigid section is about 7nm in diameter and is composed mainly of about 1200-2400 copies of the PapA subunit (16-22kDa) arranged in a tightly packed right-handed helix. The short flexible tip, consisting of PapE monomers, is 2 nm in diameter and is joined to the rigid rod by PapK adapter subunit.\n\nThe carbohydrate-binding subunit, PapG, is located exclusively at the N-terminal domain of the flexible tip and appears to be the sole determinant of binding specificity. It has mostly a b-sheet structure that can be subdivided into two regions ( Figure 21 ). One is in the form of a b-barrel similar to the corresponding region of FimH; the other, with a structure that has not been encountered elsewhere, contains the carbohydrate-binding site. Like in type 1 fimbriae, donor strand complementation between PapG and PapK has been observed in the crystal structure of the chaperonesubunit complex of the P fimbriae. As with type 1 fimbria, allelic variations in PapG are found with distinct receptor specificity.\n\nThe combining site of PapG is extended and accommodates galabiose, the primary specificity determinant, binding the disaccharide by an array of hydrogen bonds, some mediated by water molecules, and hydrophobic interactions, with space for additional monosaccharide residues at its nonreducing end ( Figure 22 ).\n\nThese fimbriae, produced by enterotoxigenic E. coli, are 3nm wide, flexible and wire-like organelles, built up of the major pilin subunit F17-A and exposing the F17-G subunit at their tip. 65 They mediate binding of the bacteria to N-acetylglucosamine-presenting receptors on the microvilli of the intestinal epithelium of ruminants, leading to diarrhea or septicemia. Binding of F17 E. coli to the microvilli is inhibited by N-acetylglucosamine as well as its Despite lack of any sequence identity, it was unexpectedly found that the lectin domain of F17-G is similar to that FimH and PapG, and that all three share the immunoglobulin-like fold of the structural components (pilins) of their fimbriae ( Figure 23 ). Analogous to the other fimbrial subunits, F17-G is a two-domain protein in which a C-terminal pilin domain is linked with an N-terminal carbohydrate-specific lectin domain.\n\nThe binding site of the lectin domain of F17a-G, one of the several cloned variants of F17-G examined in complex with the N-acetylglucosamine, is formed by the carbonyl group of Ala43, the side chains of Asp88, Thr89, Trp109, Ser117, Thr118, Gln119, and the nitrogen of Gly120 (Figure 24) . Interactions between the carbohydrate and the protein include 11 possible hydrogen bonds, of which four are mediated by water molecules, as well as the hydrophobic stacking of the Trp109 side chain against the C5 and C6 atoms of the sugar. The N-acetyl group of N-acetylglucosamine contributes significantly to the affinity of the ligand to F17a G, due to a good complementarity of van der Waals surfaces between this group and the side chains of Thr118 and Asn44, as well as the carbonyl group of Ala43.\n\nOnly small number of bacterial lectins that are soluble are known ( Table 3) . The 3-D structures of all these in complexes with ligands have been investigated by X-ray crystallography and in some cases also by NMR.\n\nTwo soluble lectins, originally isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa by Nechama Gilboa-Garber in the 1970s, 67, 68 have been well characterized. 7 The galactose-specific PA-IL is a tetramer of four identical subunits, each consisting of 121 amino acids (m.w. 12.7kDa). The subunit of the fucose-and mannose-specific PA-IIL, also a tetramer, is similar in size to that of PA-IL, but its primary structure is different. 69 The activities of both proteins are dependent upon the presence of divalent cations. The Pseudomonas-soluble lectins are found mainly in the bacterial cytoplasm. They are released by a subpopulation of the bacterial cells and serve to tether the bacteria to a substratum by binding to ill-defined structures on the bacterial surface and to a receptor on animal cells that contain the corresponding sugar.\n\nPA-IL displays medium-range affinity for galactose, with a K a of 3.4\u00c210 4 M -1 . 70, 71 Among monosaccharides, the specificity is strictly for galactose, with the exception of N-acetylgalactosamine, albeit with a lower affinity than that for galactose. The presence of a hydrophobic group on the anomeric position of the monosaccharide, either in aor b-configuration, enhances the affinity, as observed with other lectins, such as E. coli type 1 fimbriae, with the tightest binding obtained for phenyl b-thiogalactoside. As for disaccharides, only those containing a terminal a-galactose residue are recognized, such as Gala3Gal, Gala4Gal, and Gala6Glc, to which the lectin displays the highest affinity; PA-IL binds also to a large number of glycoconjugates. 72, 73 The latter include compounds containing terminal unsubstituted Gala4Gal disaccharide, that is, the human P1 and Pk blood group antigens, present on either red blood cell glycosphingolipids or on pigeon egg white glycoproteins, as well as Gala3Gal, the human B blood group antigen, and the xenoantigen present on pig tissues. PA-IIL is characterized by an unusually high affinity for L-fucose, with a K a of 1.6\u00c210 6 M -1 and binds the Le a trisaccharide [Galb3(Fuca4)GlcNAc] more strongly, with a K a of 4.7\u00c210 6 M \u00c01 . 7, 74 Thermodynamic studies indicate that these interactions are dominated by enthalpy. The entropy contribution is slightly favorable when binding to fucose and to the highest-affinity ligand Le a . The high-resolution X-ray structures of two complexes of PA-IIL with Le a and LNnFP-V (lacto-N-neofucopentaose-5, Galb4GlcNAcb4(Fuca3)Galb4Glc), allowed the precise determination of the conformation of a trisaccharide and a pentasaccharide (see later, Figure 28 ). The different types of interaction between the oligosaccharides and the protein involve not only hydrogen bonding, but also calcium-and water-bridged contacts, allowing a rationalization of the thermodynamic data.\n\nThree crystal structures of PA-IL have been reported thus far: the native lectin that contains one calcium ion per monomer, the calcium-free lectin, and the lectin with bound monosaccharide that contains both calcium and galactose ( Figure 25) . 75 In all cases, the quaternary structure is a tetramer, each of which monomers adopts a small jellyroll b-sandwich fold, consisting of two curved sheets, each one constructed from four antiparallel b strands.\n\nThe most striking feature of the PA-IIL structure is the involvement of the C-terminal carboxyl group (Gly114) of each monomer in the carbohydrate-binding site of the other monomer. Dimerization of the PA-II subunit is the result of a head-to-tail association of two monomers that make contact through the curved five-stranded b sheet. It largely involves hydrophobic contacts in the strands outside the Greek key motif of the protein and several hydrogen bonds at the extremity of these strands. 7, 76 The buried surface is $1500\u00c5 2 per monomer. The dimers form a tetramer mainly by the antiparallel association of b-strands comprised of amino acids 79-85 (strand 6) from each dimer with their counterparts in the other dimer. The surface buried by the association of the dimers into tetramers is $500\u00c5 2 per monomer.\n\nBoth lectins are unusual in binding monosaccharides via direct interaction with metal ions. 7 The sugar-binding sites of PA-IL and PA-IIL contain one and two calcium ions, respectively. In the PA-IL-galactose complex, one sugar residue is located in each monomer, close to the calcium atom. Oxygen atoms O3 and O4 of galactose are directly involved in the coordination sphere of the calcium ion ( Figure 26) . The lectin-sugar interaction also involves six direct hydrogen bonds between the sugar hydroxyl groups and the protein and an additional one bridged by a water molecule. Some limited hydrophobic contacts are established between the apolar face of the galactose residue and certain hydrophobic amino acids.\n\nIn the PA-IIL-fucose complex, the fucose residue is locked onto a pair of calcium ions. Such a protein-carbohydrate binding mode involving two calcium ions has never been observed before ( Figure 27 ). Three hydroxyl groups of fucose participate in the coordination of those calcium ions: O2 to the first calcium, O4 to the second calcium, and O3 to both of them. In addition to these electrostatic interactions, the three hydroxyl groups of the monosaccharide participate in hydrogen bonds with acidic groups of the calcium-binding site. The ring oxygen of fucose is involved in one hydrogen bond with the main chain, resulting altogether in a network of seven direct hydrogen bonds between the Analysis of the mode of binding of Le a by PA-IIL revealed a large number of contacts between the sugar and the protein ( Figure 28 ). All monosaccharide units of the trisaccharide interact with the protein surface either directly (hydrogen bonding and coordination of calcium) or indirectly through bridging water molecules. In addition to the nine direct hydrogen bonds between the fucose of Le a and the protein described, the GlcNAc residue establishes a hydrogen bond between its O6 atom and the main-chain carbonyl group of Asp96. Two water molecules play an important bridging role in the interaction: one bridges O1 and O2 of fucose to the amide nitrogen of Thr98, whereas the other bridges the Gal residue (O2 and O1) to the side chain of Ser23. Hydrophobic contacts are very limited and only involve the methyl group of fucose with that of Thr145. The conformation adopted by Le a in the binding site is similar to that predicted by those earlier studies, confirming the rigidity of the trisaccharide. Among the four independent molecules of the PA-IIL-LNnFP-V complex, clear electron density can be observed for two complete pentasaccharides ( Figure 28 ), whereas only a tetrasaccharide and a trisaccharide can be located for the two remaining sites. The fact that two of the oligosaccharides can be completely visualized is due the rigidity of their linear part resulting from fortuitous crystal packing that generates extensive contacts between two adjacent sugars centered on a pseudo twofold axis of symmetry (Figure 28c) . It is this interaction that allows the very highresolution structure of milk pentasaccharide to be described here for the first time. The protein-binding site, together with the calcium ions and fucose moiety, are identical with those described previously. Additional interactions with the protein surface are established by the glucose and galactose residues of the Le x glucose analog moiety (Figure 28b) . The glucose establishes a direct hydrogen bond between its hydroxyl group at position 2 and the side chain of Asp-96. In addition, five interactions are mediated by a water molecule, involving O1 of fucose, O1 and O6 of glucose, and O1, O2, and O6 of galactose. Hydrophobic interactions are observed for the methyl group of fucose, but also for C6 of galactose, which interacts with the carbon of a glycerol molecule located at the protein surface. The other part of the pentasaccharide, that is, the Glcb4GlcNAc linked to position 3 of galactose, does not interact with the protein surface, but instead is involved in extensive interactions with the neighboring carbohydrate in the crystal lattice ( Figure 28c) .\n\nPA-IL and PA-IIL are the first calcium-dependent lectins of bacterial origin to be structurally characterized. They do not seem to be related evolutionarily, even though they both adopt a jellyroll fold and they both use calcium for carbohydrate binding. In PA-IL, calcium, together with a unique network of hydrogen bonds, generates a binding site endowed with a selective specificity for galactose. In contrast, in PA-IIL, the two calcium ions are associated with a very high affinity (micromolar range) and a wide specificity for binding different monosaccharides. The occurrence of metal ions in lectins is well known. Carbohydrate binding by legume lectins depends on the presence of manganese and calcium ions, whose main role is to maintain the architecture of the binding site and not to make contacts with the sugar ligand. Direct calcium-sugar interactions have been observed in only two families of animal lectins: pentraxins and C-type lectins. The first family includes serum amyloid P component (SAP) and C-reactive protein (CRP), which contain two close calcium ions involved in binding of diverse ligands. The lectin activity of SAP differs from that of PA-IIL, since it is only directed to sulfated or phosphorylated carbohydrates. Despite the lack of sequence or fold similarity, the galactose-binding mode of PA-IL shows a striking resemblance to those of two C-type animal lectins complexed with galactose, that is, the QPDWG mutant of rat mannose-binding protein A and the tunicate galactosespecific C-type lectin, TC14, from Polyandrocarpa misakiens. 7, 78 Nevertheless, in PA-IL, the occurrence of an additional strong interaction with the galactose O6 group can explain the 10-fold higher galactose affinity compared to that of the C-type animal lectins.\n\nTwo soluble bacterial lectins have been recently isolated from the plant pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, each with different affinity to fucose. One of these is RSL (subunit M(r) 9.9 kDa), related to fungal lectins, 79 and the other is RS-IIL (subunit M(r) 11.6kDa), a tetrameric lectin, with high sequence similarity to PA-IIL. 80 RSL consists of 90 amino acids with a tandem repeat in its amino acid sequence. It binds fucose with K a of 5\u00c210 5 M -1 . Among the monosaccharides tested, only L-galactose and D-arabinose, differing from fucose just by the substituent at C6, displayed some binding, albeit with affinity 4-5 times lower than that of fucose. RSL shows a preference for binding to Fuca2Gal and Fuca6Gal epitopes. It possesses two binding sites per monomer and an unusually high affinity for Fuca2Gal-containing oligosaccharides (K a of 4\u00c210 6 M -1 for 2-fucosyllactose). The lectin has been crystallized with MeaFuc and with the highest-affinity ligand 2-fucosyllactose. The X-ray crystal structure of the RSL-MeaFuc complex revealed that each monomer consists of two small four-stranded antiparallel sheets ( Figure 29 ). Trimerization through a threefold or pseudo-threefold axis generates a six-bladed b-propeller architecture, very similar to that previously described for the fungal lectin of Aleuria aurantia. Each monomer presents two fucose-binding sites, resulting in six symmetrically arranged sugar-binding sites for the b-propeller.\n\nThe hydrogen-bonding network between fucose and protein consists of six bonds. The fucose hydroxyl O2 is bridged to the main chain by the amide group of Ala40a in site 1 (Ala85 in site 2). Hydroxyl O3 receives hydrogen from NE1 of Trp81 (Trp36 of neighboring monomer in site 2) and donates to the carboxyl group of Glu28 (Glu73 in site 2). The other acidic oxygen of this carboxyl receives a hydrogen bond from O4 of fucose that is also hydrogen-bonded to NE of Arg17 (Arg62 in site 2). Finally, the ring oxygen O5 receives a hydrogen bond from the terminal NH 2 of the same arginine. In the high-resolution structure of RSL complexed with MeaFuc, water molecules are observed bound to the most accessible oxygens of fucose, O1, and O2, but they are not present in all sites and do not bridge to the protein. Hydrophobic contacts play an important role in the binding of fucose; Trp76 (Trp31 of the neighboring monomer in site 2) stacks to the fucose hydrophobic face (C3, C5, and C6) with distances smaller than 4\u00c5 . On the other face of fucose, the sulfur atom of Cys30 (Cys75 in site 2) establishes a hydrophobic contact with the methine carbon C2. The methyl group at C6 is inserted in a hydrophobic pocket made by isoleucine residues 59 and 61 (monomer Pro14 and Ile16 in site 2) and tryptophan residues 10 and 81 (Trp53 of the same monomer and Trp16 of the neighboring one in site 2).\n\nThe same fucose-binding mode is observed in all of the complexes studied, with a very limited variation in the fucose orientation. The only difference between site 1 and site 2 is the Ile59/Pro14 substitution in the hydrophobic pocket. In all binding sites, the hydrogen bond network is fully conserved.\n\nIn the RSL-FucLac complex (intramonomer (site 1) and intermonomer (site 2)), the trisaccharide adopts very similar conformations and establishes the same contacts with the protein. The interactions involving the fucose residue have been described above. The galactose does not interact with the protein surface but makes an interresidue Gal.O2-Fuc.O3 hydrogen bond with the fucose residue. The glucose residue is folded back on the protein surface with its hydrophobic face, made by the CH of C1, C3, and C5, establishing van der Waals interactions with the plane surface created by a side chain of Asp32 that creates a salt bridge with Arg17 (Asp77 and Arg62 in site 2). In site 2, there is an additional stabilization by O6 interacting with the side chain of Trp53 through a bridging water molecule.\n\nRS-IIL recognizes fucose but displays much higher affinity for mannose and fructose, which is opposite to the preference of PA-IIL. The binding loop of the cations is fully conserved in RS-IIL as in PA-IIL, whereas the preference for mannose versus fucose can be attributed to the change of a three-amino-acid sequence in the 'specificity loop'. The RS-IIL crystal contains one monomer of 113 amino acids per asymmetric unit, together with two Ca 2\u00fe ions and one MeaMan molecule ( Figure 30) . The overall topology of RS-IIL is that of a nine-stranded antiparallel b-sandwich consisting of two sheets of four and five strands respectively. In the tetrameric quaternary structure, one interface between two monomers is created by strong complementary packing of the one hydrophobic curved b-sheet to its counterpart, and the other interface is created via sheet extension ( Figure 30 ). Both monomeric and tetrameric structures are very similar to those described in detail for several crystal structures of PA-IIL. 77, 78 The binding site is occupied by two Ca 2\u00fe ions and a mannose residue. The two ions are located close together, 3.75\u00c5 , and both display a classical seven-ligand coordination, mainly involving one loop, the conserved 'calcium-binding loop', via the side chains of Glu94, Asp98, Asp100, Asn102, and Asp103. A second loop is involved through the side chain of Asn21. In addition, the acidic group of the C-terminus Gly113 of the other monomer, which is involved in the head-totail interaction, also participates in the coordination of the Ca 2\u00fe ions. All amino acids of the calcium-binding site are strictly conserved between PA-IIL and RS-IIL, and the Ca 2\u00fe ions are bound in a similar manner.\n\nIn the RSLII-MeaMan complex (Figure 30) , O2, O3, and O4 participate directly in the coordination of the Ca 2\u00fe ions, with a special position for O3, which participates in the coordination sphere of both. The O3, O4, and O6 hydroxyl groups of mannose are involved in hydrogen bonds with acidic amino acids of the calcium-binding loop extending from Glu94 to Asp103. The O2 hydroxyl group establishes hydrogen bonds with the backbone oxygen of Asn21 as well as with the C-terminus from the adjacent monomer. The ring oxygen O5 receives a hydrogen bond from the backbone nitrogen of Ala23. One water molecule makes an additional interaction by bridging between O4 and the backbone nitrogen of Thr97. Hydrophobic contacts appear to be very limited: only the methyl group of the MeaMan ligand is in relatively close position to Ala23. The comparison with the binding mode of mannose in PA-IIL shows similar contacts except in the region of O6. Figure 31 Structure of the N-linked undecasaccharide Man 9 GlcNAc 2 (Man(9)) where the outer mannose residues are labeled as D1, D2, and D3. In the corresponding decasaccharide (Man (8) they do not form, however, separate domains, since the overall fold is dependent on numerous contacts between them. Rather, two symmetrically related domains are formed by strand exchange between the two repeats. Among the properties of CVN is its ability to block HIV envelope-mediated fusion. The affinity of oligosaccharide ligands to CVN was measured by their ability to inhibit the fusion-blocking activity of CVN in an HIV fusion assay. By this assay, it was found that CVN binds to gp120 with an equilibrium association constant K a of 2.4\u00c210 7 M -1 and an apparent stoichiometry of 2 equiv. of CVN per gp120; Man(8) acts as a divalent ligand (2 CVN:1 saccharide) with a K a of 5.4\u00c210 7 M -1 , and Man(9) functions as a trivalent ligand (3 CVN:1 saccharide) with a K a of 1.3\u00c210 8 M -1 . Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments of CVN binding to Man(9) confirmed the nanomolar affinity of K a of 1.5\u00c210 8 M -1 , and the fitted data indicated a stoichiometry equal to approximately 1:1 CVN:Man(9).\n\nThe 1:1 stoichiometry at micromolar concentrations suggested that CVN has not only a high-affinity binding site relevant to the studies at nanomolar concentrations, but a lower-affinity site as well that facilitates cross-linking of CVN-oligomannose at micromolar concentrations or higher. The high-affinity site has a K a of 7.2\u00c210 6 M -1 and the low-affinity site a K a of 6.8\u00c210 5 M -1 , as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. The specificity studies indicated that the minimum structure required for high-affinity binding comprises the Mana2Mana that represents the terminal disaccharide of all three arms of Man (9) . High-resolution NMR experiments demonstrate that CVN binds the above disaccharide via two distinct binding sites of differing affinities located on opposite ends of the protein. 83 Further NMR analysis of the solution structure of a complex of CVN-Mana2Mana at a molar ratio 1:2 revealed that the lectin recognizes the stacked conformation of the disaccharide through a deep hydrophilic-binding pocket on one side of the protein (site 2) and a semicircular cleft on the other (site 1) 85 ( Figure 33 ). With the prominent exception of the C1 hydroxyl group of the reducing mannopyranose ring, the bound disaccharide is positioned so that each hydroxyl group is involved in a direct or water-mediated hydrogen bond to the polar or charged side chains comprising the binding pocket. The approximately 40\u00c5 spacing of the two binding sites provides a simple model for CVN:gp120 binding. The CVN: Mana2Mana complex provides the first high-resolution structure of a mannose-specific protein-carbohydrate complex with nanomolar affinity and presents a new carbohydrate-binding motif, as well as a new class of carbohydrate-binding protein, that facilitates divalent binding via a monomeric protein.\n\nSite 1 of CVN is able to discriminate between the three related trisaccharides Mea(Mana2Mana2Man), Mea-(Mana2Mana3Man), and Mea(Mana2Mana6Man) with remarkable selectivity, and binds these trisaccharides with K a values ranging from 8.1\u00c210 3 M \u00c01 to 6.6\u00c210 6 M \u00c01 . Site 2 is less selective in that it binds all three trisaccharides with similar K a values ranging from 1.7 to 3.7\u00c210 5 M \u00c01 , but overall binds these trimannosides with higher affinities than site 1.\n\nRecently, another cyanobacterial protein known as MVL, originally isolated from a laboratory culture of Microcystis viridis NIES-102. 86 MVL has also been shown to inhibit HIV-1 fusion at nanomolar concentrations. 87 Like cyanovirin, MVL is unusual in that it binds oligosaccharides with very high affinity in the absence of multivalent interactions. However, it is is distinct among oligomannose-binding proteins in that it exhibits fine specificity for the Mana6Manb4GlcNAcb4GlcNAc tetrasaccharide core found in N-linked oligomannosides. MVL in solution is a monodisperse homodimer with four independent carbohydrate-binding sites. Each subunit comprises two homologous domains, each consisting of 54 residues with 50% sequence identity between them, connected by a five-residue linker. MVL exhibits no significant sequence similarity to any other known protein family. X-ray crystallography of MVL free and bound to the pentasaccharide Man 3 GlcNAc 2 confirmed that the protein is a homodimer stabilized by an extensive intermolecular interface between monomers 87,88 ( Figure 34 ). Each In the N-domain, strands 1, 2, and 3 and helix 1 comprise residues 2-10, 32-41, 45-53, and 14-29, respectively; in the C-domain, strands 4, 5, and 6 and helix 2 comprise residues 61-69, 91-100, 104-112, and 73-88, respectively. b, Ribbon diagram of the free MVL dimer with one subunit in blue and the other in red, together with water molecules (green spheres) and associated side chains that participate in water-bridged hydrogen bonds between the two monomers. c, Ribbon diagram of the MVL-Man 3 GlcNAc 2 complex with the bound carbohydrate depicted as cylinders and spheres (carbon, yellow; nitrogen, blue; and oxygen, red). d, Combined surface, tube, stick, and space-filling representation of the MVL dimer illustrating the water-filled channel formed between monomers in the dimer. A surface diagram of one monomer (red) and tube diagram of the second monomer (blue) are shown with space-filling rendering of water (gray) and ethylene glycol (green) molecules that fill the channel between the monomers. monomer contains two structurally homologous domains with high sequence similarity connected by a short fiveamino-acid residue linker. Intriguingly, a water-filled channel is observed between the two monomers. Man 3 GlcNAc 2 binds to a preformed cleft at the distal end of each domain such that a total of four independent carbohydrate molecules associate with each homodimer. The binding cleft provides shape complementarity, including the presence of a deep hydrophobic hole that accommodates the N-acetyl methyl at the reducing end of the carbohydrate, and specificity arises from seven to eight intermolecular hydrogen bonds, one water-mediated bond, and a number of hydrophobic interactions ( Figure 35 ). \n\nNathan Sharon is Emeritus Professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science, which he joined in 1954, after receiving his Ph.D. Degree from the Hebrew University, Jerusalem.
