{"title": "Assessing activity of Hepatitis A virus 3C protease using a cyclized luciferase-based biosensor", "body": "Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is the commonest cause of clinically apparent viral hepatitis. Almost 1.4 million new cases of HAV infection are estimated to occur globally each year, with 11%e22% requiring hospitalization [1e3] . HAV is a small nonenveloped RNA virus with a single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 7500 nucleotides, and is a member of the family Picornaviridae. The single large open reading frame in the HAV genome is divided into three functional regions, designated P1, P2, and P3. The P1 region encodes the capsid polypeptides (VP1, VP2, and VP3), and the P2 and P3 regions encode the nonstructural polypeptides, which are predicted to be processed into mature viral proteins by viral proteases [1,4e7] . The HAV 3C cysteine protease (3C pro ) is responsible for most cleavage within the viral polyprotein, supporting viral replication and proliferation [1, 7, 8] .\n\nIts pivotal role in viral replication and proliferation makes HAV 3C pro one of the major targets in the design of anti-HAV drugs [6] . The traditional screening methods used to detect HAV 3C pro activity are so slow and inefficient that they do not meet the requirements for high-throughput screening. Therefore, a simple, efficient, highthroughput method for the detection of HAV 3C pro activity at the cell level, which fully reflects the characteristic biological activity of the protease, is urgently required. Compared with fluorescencebased assays, bioluminescence-based assays are markedly more sensitivity, with a wider dynamic range in detecting the activities of proteases [9e11] . Firefly luciferase is a 61-kDa monomeric enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of firefly luciferin, which then emits a yellow-green light in the presence of ATP and oxygen [12, 13] . As a reporter protein, firefly luciferase is widely used to detect apoptosis and enzyme activity, and to screen for antiapoptotic drugs and identify enzyme recognition sequences [14e16] . Previous research has shown that DNA polymerase III intein (DnaE) from Nostoc punctiforme (Npu) catalyzes the protein trans-splicing reaction at an extraordinarily high rate and is widely used in the cyclization of proteins without affecting their activities [17e19]. Therefore, DnaE was fused to a randomly mutated thermally stable firefly luciferase construct, modified at residue 358 or 233, to increase the sensitivity of the firefly luciferase assay of apoptosis. In a series of experiments, these recombined luciferase reporters displayed increased sensitivity and yielded reproducible data with low background [16, 20] .\n\nRecently, our group has previously shown that HAV 3C pro cleaves the glutamine residue at position 304 (Gln304) of human NF-kB essential modulator (NEMO) to inhibit the expression of type I interferon (IFN) [21] . Therefore, in this study, we combined the HAV 3C pro cleavage recognition sequence of NEMO with a simple reporter system involving firefly luciferase to produce a cell-based protease reporter system, generating the reporters 233-HAV (233H), 358-HAV (358H), 233-DnaE-HAV (233DH), and 358-DnaE-HAV (358DH). The cyclized firefly luciferase protein expressed by 233DH was successfully cleaved by HAV 3C pro , resulting in a significant increase in luciferase activity. The luciferase activity of 233DH was confirmed to be specifically dependent on HAV 3C pro activity, but not on the protease activities of other viruses, including the noroviruses (NoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), confirming the specificity of 233DH for HAV 3C pro activity. Taken together, we might have developed a rapid and sensitive method to detect HAV 3C pro activity in HEK-293T cells.\n\nHuman embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T) and human hepatoma cells (Huh-7), obtained from the China Center for Type Culture Collection, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 C under 5% CO 2 in a humidified incubator.\n\nThe cDNA expression constructs encoding wild type HAV 3C pro and its catalytically inactive mutant (C172A) have been described previously [21] . The 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) genes from NoV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, PEDV, and PDCoV were also synthesized/amplified and cloned into pCAGGS-HA-C.\n\nThe DNA sequence encoding the conserved residues in DnaE [20] was synthesized and cloned into the pCAGGS-MCS vector to construct pCAGGS-DnaE. The sequences encoding the C-terminal fragment (amino acids 235e544) and the N-terminal fragment (amino acids 4e233) of firefly luciferase were amplified from the firefly luciferase reporter vector pGL4.21luc2P/Puro (Promega, USA), respectively. With two-step overlapping PCR, the sequences encoding amino acids 4e233 and 235e544 were cloned together into the pCAGGS-MCS vector, to generate the pCAGGS-233 vector. The sequences encoding other N-terminal (amino acids 4e354) and C-terminal fragments (amino acids 358e544) of firefly luciferase were also amplified and cloned to generate the pCAGGS-358 vector. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the amino acid sequence PVLKAQYADIYKA of NEMO (cleaved by HAV 3C pro ) or ENLYFQYS (cleaved by Tobacco etch virus (TEV) 3C pro ) [13, 21] was also ligated into the pCAGGS-233 vector to construct the 233H reporter or the control 233 reporter, respectively. The sequence encoding amino acids 4e233 and 235e544 fused to the corresponding amino sequence PVLKAQYADIYKA or ENLYFQYS was cloned into pCAGGS-DnaE, to generate the 233DH reporter or the control 233D reporter, respectively. The same construction strategy was used to generate the 358H reporter, the 358DH reporter, and their control reporters 358 and 358D, respectively. The sequences of biosensor expression plasmids are shown in Table S1 .\n\nBriefly, HEK-293T cells cultured in 60 mm dishes were transfected with the various plasmids. After 30 h, the cells were harvested by the addition of lysis buffer, and the protein concentrations were measured in the whole-cell extracts. The proteins in the extracts were separated with 12% SDS-PAGE and then electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membranes were incubated with antibodies and secondary antibodies. To confirm the expression levels of HA-tagged wild-type (WT) and mutant 3C pro , an anti-HA antibody (MBL, Japan) was used in an immunoblotting analysis. An anti-goat monoclonal secondary antibody (Promega, USA) was used to detect the expression of each luciferase reporter.\n\nThe expression of b-actin was monitored with an anti-b-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (Beyotime, China) to confirm equal protein loading.\n\nThe luciferase reporter constructs 233H, 358H, 233DH, 358DH and their controls (233, 358, 233D, 358D respectively) were used to detect HAV 3C pro activity. HEK-293T cells or Huh-7 cells plated in 48-well plates were transfected with various 3C pro and 3CL pro expression plasmids or the empty control plasmid, together with the luciferase reporter plasmid and pRL-TK (Promega) (used as an internal control to normalize transfection efficiency). The cells were lysed 36 h later, and the firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were determined with a luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, USA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The data represent the relative firefly luciferase activities normalized to the corresponding Renilla luciferase activities.\n\nThe results are presented as the means \u00b1 standard deviations (SD) of at least three experiments. Significant differences were detected with Student's t-test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ****P < 0.0001; ns, not significant).\n\nAs described in our previous study, HAV 3C pro recognizes and cleaves human NEMO at the Gln304 residue [21] . Thus, we combined the HAV 3C pro cleavage recognition sequence (PVLKAQYADIYKA) of NEMO with a firefly luciferase reporter system to monitor the activity of HAV 3C pro in HEK-293T cells. To this end, pCAGGS-233 and pCAGGS-358 were fused to the cleavage sequence of NEMO recognized by HAV 3C pro to generate 233H and 358H, respectively (Fig. 1A) . As described previously, DnaE is widely used in the cyclization of proteins because this cyclization does not affect their activities, and increases the sensitivity of firefly luciferase assays [13,16e20] . Therefore, 233-DnaE (233D) and 358-DnaE (358D), fused to split DnaE, were also fused to the cleavage sequence of NEMO to generate 233DH and 358DH, respectively (Fig. S1A ). As shown in Fig. 1A , 233H, 358H, 233DH and 358DH expressed the divided N-terminal (amino acids 2e232 or 2e354) and C-terminal fragments (amino acids 235e544 or 358e544) of firefly luciferase in the inactive state. In the presence of DnaE, the expressed N-and C-terminal fragments 233DH and 358DH were cyclized to restrict the movement of the two domains, locking the enzyme into the more inactive form. If the recognition peptide inserted between the N-terminal fragment and C-terminal fragment of firefly luciferase was cleaved by HAV 3C pro , the two domains of firefly luciferase could theoretically interact freely and the enzyme would become fully active. In Fig. 1A , to detect any nonspecific cleavage by HAV 3C pro , the 233, 358, 233D, and 358D reporters were fused to the ENLYFQYS sequence, recognized by TEV 3C pro , and used as the controls for the corresponding proteins [13] .\n\nTo test whether the four recombinant firefly luciferases fused to the cleavage sequence of NEMO were successfully recognized and cleaved by HAV 3C pro , HEK-293T cells were transfected with the HAV 3C pro expression plasmid, together with the reporter 233H, 358H, 233DH, or 358DH, or the corresponding control. A western blotting analysis showed that the protein bands from the cells cotransfected with HAV 3C pro and 233H, 358H, 233DH, or 358DH migrated fastest ( Fig. 1B and C) . The HAV-3C pro -induced cleavage of 233H and 358H produced two new cleaved bands (Fig. 1B) . However, because of the cyclization conferred by DnaE, only 233DH and 358DH were linearized, displaying greater mobility after cleavage, and resulting in a slightly shorter product than the full-length protein on the western blot (Fig. 1C) . No cleavage phenomenon was observed in the cells transfected with the 233, 358, 233D, or 358D reporter fused to the recognition sequence of TEV 3C pro ( Fig. 1B and C) . These results confirm that the four recombinant luciferase constructs fused to the cleavage sequence of NEMO are specifically recognized and cleaved by HAV 3C pro , suggesting their potential utility in assessing the HAV 3C pro activity in HEK-293T cells.\n\nTo evaluate the reporters' functions in a luciferase activity assay, cells were cotransfected with each of the four reporters or their respective controls, pRL-TK, and the HAV 3C pro expression plasmid. At 36 h posttransfection, a dual-luciferase assay was performed. The results shown in Fig. 2A indicate that the activity of 233DH was significantly induced by HAV 3C pro , whereas that of the control reporter 233D remained low. However, although the activity of the 233H, 358H, and 358DH reporters also increased to some extent, the activities of the control reporters also increased as the expression of HAV 3C pro increased ( Fig. 2A) , suggesting that the activities of these reporters might be nonspecific. These results indicate that the 233DH reporter is the most sensitive and reliable of the four constructed. To further confirm the effect of 233DH in the luciferase activity assay, HEK-293T cells or Huh-7 cells were transfected with different amounts of the HAV 3C pro expression plasmid and the 233D or 233DH reporter. The results shown in Fig. 2B and C demonstrate that the luciferase activity of the 233DH reporter was effectively and dose-dependently induced by HAV 3C pro in both the HEK-293T and Huh-7 cells. The control reporter activity was not induced. Western blotting also showed that HAV 3C pro dose-dependently cleaved the recombinant firefly luciferase in the cyclized form, 233DH, producing a faster-migrating protein band, but did not cleave the control reporter (Fig. 2D) . The cleavage shown in Fig. 2D is consistent with the fold induction in the luciferase activity shown in Fig. 2B and C, confirming the correlation between the luciferase activity assay and the cleavage of the reporter construct by HAV 3C pro .\n\nAccording to a previous study, Cysteine 172 (Cys172) of HAV 3C pro is part of the catalytic dyad and is essential to its protease activity [22, 23] . Comparison of the protein sequences and threedimensional structures of HAV 3C pro , Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 3C pro , enterovirus 71 (EV71) 3C pro , and human rhinovirus (HRV) 3C pro showed that the region around the Cys172 residue is conserved (data not show). Therefore, a mutant 3C pro at the Cys172 residue (3C pro -C172A) was constructed. To explore whether the luciferase activity of the 233DH reporter relies on the protease activity of 3C pro , HEK-293T cells were transfected with different amounts of plasmid encoding 3C pro -C172A or WT HAV 3C pro , together with the 233DH reporter and pRL-TK. Unlike the dose-dependent activation of luciferase activity induced by HAV 3C pro , the mutant 3C pro -C172A was incapable of activating the 233DH reporter (Fig. 3A) . To explore the mechanism underlying the failure of overexpressed 3C pro -C172A to induce the reporter luciferase activity, WT HAV 3C pro or 3C pro -C172A was overexpressed in the presence of the recombinant firefly luciferase 233DH reporter. As shown in Fig. 3B , the cyclized form of the recombinant firefly luciferase was cleaved normally and dose-dependently by WT HAV 3C pro , generating a faster-migrating protein band. However, no cleavage product was observed when HAV 3C pro -C172A was overexpressed, confirming that the activation of this luciferase reporter system is specifically dependent on the protease activity of HAV 3C pro .\n\nTo confirm the specificity of 233DH for HAV 3C pro , we used the 3CL pro proteins of typical human viruses NoV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV 229E and animal coronaviruses PEDV and PDCoV as the negative controls. 3CL pro of PEDV and PDCoV are both reported to cleave NEMO at Gln231, which differs from the peptide sequence of NEMO inserted into the 233DH reporter [24, 25] . To analyze the luciferase activity, HEK-293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HAV 3C pro or 3CL pro of NoV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV 229E, PEDV, or PDCoV, together with the 233DH reporter and pRL-TK. As shown in Fig. 4A , HAV 3C pro successfully induced luciferase activity, whereas the other viral 3CL pro proteases failed to activate the 233DH reporter. The western blot shown in Fig. 4B shows that, unlike HAV 3C pro , the other viral 3CL pro proteases were unable to cleave the cyclized recombinant firefly luciferase, which is consistent with the result of the luciferase activity analysis. These data show that only the 233DH reporter fused to the peptide PVLKAQYADIYKA was specifically recognized and cleaved by HAV 3C pro , demonstrating the excellent potential utility of the 233DH reporter in screening for HAV 3C pro -specific inhibitors.\n\nIn the development of anti-HAV drugs, HAV 3C pro is one of the major targets used to identify suitable compounds or smallmolecule polypeptides that inhibit HAV. Therefore, the analysis of 3C pro activity in live cells with an efficient high-throughput strategy is critical [6, 26, 27] . Here, we developed the 233DH reporter system, based on cyclized recombinant firefly luciferase and the peptide substrate of HAV 3C pro in NEMO (PVLKAQYADIYKA) [21] . Our study demonstrates that the luciferase activity of the 233DH reporter is significantly activated by HAV 3C pro , confirming the excellent prospects of the 233DH reporter in the analysis of HAV 3C pro activity.\n\nBecause the rate of the protein trans-splicing reaction is high, DnaE is widely used to cyclize proteins without affecting their activities [17e19]. In this study, DnaE was used to cyclize the two domains of firefly luciferase to generate a cyclized recombinant firefly luciferase. The circularly permuted luciferase successfully restricts the movement of the two domains of firefly luciferase and locks the enzyme in its less-active open form [13] . This underpins the high sensitivity and low background of the 233DH reporter system ( Fig. 2A) . However, the cyclized recombinant firefly luciferase in the 358DH reporter was not significantly activated by HAV 3C pro , and the 358D reporter fused to the sequence recognized by the TEV protease was slightly activated by HAV 3C pro . Moreover, the uncyclized firefly luciferase in 233H, 358H, and their control reporters could randomly form an active firefly luciferase, generating the high background observed in the luciferase activity analysis (Fig. S1B) . We also found that the capacity of HAV 3C pro to activate 233DH depends on the residue (C172) involved in its protease activity (Fig. 3A) . Therefore, this firefly luciferase system can also be used to identify other potentially catalytic residues of HAV 3C pro . In addition, HAV 3C pro activated the 233DH reporter significantly more effectively than did the 3CL pro proteases of NoV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV 229E, PEDV, and PDCoV (Fig. 4A) , revealing its potential utility in specifically detecting HAV 3C pro activity in HEK-293T cells. All these results confirm that the use of DnaE and the firefly luciferase fragments consisting of amino acids 4e233 and 235e544 significantly enhanced the sensitivity and specificity of the detection of HAV 3C pro activity. Therefore, the 233DH reporter could be selected to monitor HAV 3C pro activity in the future study.\n\nIn summary, using DnaE to cyclize firefly luciferase significantly enhanced the detection of HAV 3C pro activity in HEK-293T cells. The 233DH reporter system constructed represents an improved biosensor that is sensitive and yields reproducible data. It has potential utility in screening for HAV-3C-specific inhibitors or broadspectrum inhibitors of the 3C proteases of viruses in the family Picornaviridae. "}
