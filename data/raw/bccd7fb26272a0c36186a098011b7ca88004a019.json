Cells were harvested and fractionated into cytosolic (cyto.) and nuclear/insoluble (nucl./insol.) extracts. Western blotting was performed to detect the dynamic relocalization of Flag-SINTBAD, the detection of histone H3 and Tubulin show the purity of cell fractions. S5 . Disaggregation of heat shock-induced SINT-speckles is independent of de novo protein expression and autophagy, Related to Figure 3. (A) SINTBAD-deficient U2OS cells reconstituted with Flag-SINTBAD were left untreated or exposed to heat shock. Indicated cells were allowed to recover from heat shock at 37 \u00b0C for 3 h in the absence or presence of the translation inhibitor anisomycin (5 \u00b5g/ml). (B) SINTBAD-deficient U2OS cells stably expressing Flag-SINTBAD were left untreated or exposed to heat shock, followed by a 3 h long recovery period at 37 \u00b0C. Treatments and recovery were performed in the presence of the indicated autophagy inhibitors ( Fig. S6 . SINTBAD does not colocalize with membrane-surrounded organelles, Related to Figure 4 . U2OS cells stably expressing Flag-SINTBAD were treated with arsenite, exposed to heat shock or left untreated as shown. Immunofluorescence studies were performed by costaining Flag-SINTBAD together and the indicated marker proteins for Golgi (RCAS1), lysosomes (LAMP1), peroxisomes (CAT), endosomes (EEA1) and endoplasmatic reticulum (PDI). Representative pictures are shown. Scale bars = 10 \u03bcm. cells were transfected to express Flag-SINTBAD and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. After identification of co-immunoprecipitating proteins by mass spectrometry, the specifically interacting proteins were defined according to the criteria indicated above. (B) U2OS cells were transfected to express the SINTBAD interactor PTPN23 either alone or together with Flag-tagged SINTBAD, followed by treatment with arsenite as shown. Immunofluorescence was used to reveal the intracellular localization of the proteins. Scale bar = 10 \u03bcm. Reconstituted U2OS cells stably expressing Flag-SINTBAD were treated with ULK1-and ULK2-specific Accell siRNAs. Three days after siRNA transfection, one aliquot of the cells was analyzed for efficient mRNA knockdown by qPCR using primers specific for ULK1 and ULK2, respectively. Gene expression values were normalized to transcription of the \u03b2-Actin encoding gene (ACTB), ULK1/2 expression in the control cells transfected with scrambled siRNAs was set as 1. \n\nThe following reagents were purchased from the indicated companies: Anisomycin (A9789, \n\nIn order to generate SINTBAD-and/or AZI2-deficient U2OS cells, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing technology was performed as described (Ran et al., 2013) . The target site for human SINTBAD was designed as an anti-sense sgRNA (5\u00b4-CGTAGACTTTGAGGCGGCGT-3\u00b4) within the first exon of the SINTBAD gene. The target site for sgAZI2 was designed within the second exon as 5\u00b4-GGCCTATCATGCATATCGAG-3\u00b4. Oligos were ligated into px459 V2.0 vector (Addgene plasmid #62988) using standard protocols and verified by sequencing. U2OS cells, seeded in a 6 cm dish, were transfected with 1 \u00b5g of empty px459 or px459-sgRNA vector. One day after transfection, cells were selected for 30 h using 1 \u00b5g/ml Puromycin (Invivogen), diluted and further grown to allow the formation of single-cell clones. These clones were picked and analyzed for SINTBAD, AZI2\n\nand Cas9 expression and verified by sequencing of the genomic DNA at the appropriate locus.\n\nTo obtain SINTBAD/AZI2 double-deficient cells, a SINTBAD-deficient cell clone was transfected with px459-sgAZI2 and selected as described above. To reconstitute SINTBADdeficient U2OS cells, cells were transfected with an pcDNA3.1/zeo-Flag-SINTBAD expression construct and continuously selected using 400 \u00b5g/ml Zeocin (Invivogen). Singlecell clones were picked an analyzed by Western blotting.\n\nReconstituted U2OS \n\nTo prepare cell lysates under native conditions, cells were lysed on ice for 20 min in IGEPAL buffer (20 M Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 % IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 % glycerol and freshly added 10 mM NaF, 0.5 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 1 mM PMSF, 5 \u00b5g/ml leupeptin and 5 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and the supernatants were transferred into a fresh tube and either used for coimmunoprecipitation studies or mixed with sample buffer for Western blot analysis. To lyse cells under denaturing conditions, the washed cell pellets were resuspended in 1 \uf0b4 SDS sample buffer and sonicated two times for 20 sec with a Branson sonifier to shear the genomic DNA. After boiling the samples for 5 min, the lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. For subcellular fractionation experiments, cells, grown and treated in a 6 cm dish, were lysed in 160 \u00b5l low-salt buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, added PMSF) on ice for 10 min. NP-40 (Roche) was added to a final concentration of 0.25 %, samples were briefly vortexed and centrifuged for 10 sec at 16 000 \u00d7 g. The supernatants\n\nrepresenting the cytoplasmic fractions were collected in fresh tubes and mixed with 5 \u00d7 SDS sample buffer. The remaining pellets representing the nuclear/insoluble fractions were washed twice in low-salt buffer and then resuspended in 180 \u00b5l 1 \u00d7 SDS sample buffer, boiled and sheared two times for 20 sec with a sonifier. The purity of the cellular fractions was confirmed by Western blotting, detecting Tubulin and histone H3 as markers for the cytosolic or nuclear/insoluble fraction, respectively.\n\nFor coimmunoprecipitation, cleared cell extracts lysed in IGEPAL lysis buffer were filled up to a volume of 600 \u03bcl with lysis buffer and supplemented with 1 \u03bcg precipitating antibody or control IgG. After adding 20 \u03bcl protein A/G agarose (Millipore), the samples were incubated for 4 h at 4\u00b0C on a rotating wheel. Alternatively, covalently antibody-coupled affinity gels were used for coimmunoprecipitation (anti-Flag M2 affinity gel, A2220, Sigma-Aldrich;\n\nGFP-Trap_A, Chromotek). Agarose beads were then washed four times with 1 ml cold IGEPAL buffer. Precipitated proteins were eluted by adding 1.5 \u00d7 SDS sample buffer. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by semidry blotting to a PVDF membrane (IPVH00010, Millipore). Further analysis was performed using standard methods.\n\nAfter blocking the membrane, primary antibodies, diluted in 2 % nonfat dry milk or 5 % BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in TBST, were incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Peroxidase-coupled antibodies (Jackson ImmuoResearch) were diluted 1:5000 in 2 % dry milk in TBST and incubated 2 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected using the Western Lightning Plus-ECL reagent (Perkin Elmer) and visualized on a ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad).\n\nU2OS cells or their derivatives were grown on coverslips in 12-or 24-well plates. Cells were transfected and/or treated as indicated and described in the figure legend. After washing the cells with PBS, cells were fixed for 1 min with ice-cold methanol/acetone (1:1). After rehydration, the cells were blocked with 5 % BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature.\n\nCoverslips were subsequently incubated with the indicated primary antibodies, diluted in PBS containing 1 % BSA and 0.1 % Triton X-100, for 90 min at room temperature or at 4 \u00b0C overnight. After washing three times with PBS cells were incubated with the appropriate secondary Alexa488-or Cy3-conjugated antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:3000 in 1 % BSA in PBS for 90 min in the dark. After incubation, cells were washed three times in PBS and the nuclear DNA was stained with Hoechst 33324 (Invitrogen). The samples were mounted with Mowiol mounting medium and stored at 4 \u00b0C. Analysis of the stained cells was done using an Eclipse TE2000-E microscope (Nikon) and a 63 \u00d7 oil-immersion lens. For each condition >30 healthy individual cells were analyzed and pictures of one representative cell were taken with an OCRA-spark digital CMOS camera (C11440-36U, Hamamatsu). For the quantification of protein localizations and cellular phenotypes, at least 100 cells for each condition were analyzed.\n\nTo identify SINTBAD interactors by mass spectrometry, 293T cells were either transfected with the pcDNA3.1-Flag-SINTBAD expression construct or the empty vector. Four 10 cm dishes for each condition were taken for large-scale immunoprecipitation. Washed cells were harvested and lysed in 1 ml low-salt buffer as described above. The received cytosolic fraction was mixed with 1 ml IGEPAL lysis buffer, containing Complete Protease Inhibitor\n\nCocktail and PhosSTOP (Roche). The remaining cell pellet was washed two times in low-salt buffer and then resuspended in 2 ml IGEPAL lysis buffer and sonified two times for 20 sec.\n\nThe two fractions were precleared by incubating them 1 h with 3 \u00b5g control mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 40 \u00b5l Protein A/G Agarose. Afterwards, immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating the lysates with 6 \u00b5g anti-Flag M2 antibodies together with 80 \u00b5l Agarose beads for 4 h at 4 \u00b0C on a rotating wheel. Beads were washed five times with 2 ml IGEPAL lysis buffer, transferred to a fresh tube and proteins were eluted at 70 \u00b0C for 10 min in LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). Samples were separated on a 4-12 % Bis-Tris gradient-gel (NuPAGE, Invitrogen), stained with colloidal Coomassie (Invitrogen) and cut into small pieces (7 slides each lane). In-gel digestion of the proteins with trypsin and purification of the peptides was performed as described (Seibert et al., 2019) . Peptide solutions were desalted by stop and go extraction (STAGE) tips (Rappsilber et al., 2003) . The purification and mass spectrometry of two individual experiments was performed with a time lag and therefore analyzed with different instrumental settings. Dissenting setting parameters of analysis 1 and 2 are indicated by a slash. Samples were eluted from STAGE tips with acetonitrile and applied to the UHPLC system (EASY-nLC 1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 0.1 % formic acid. Separation of peptides by hydrophobicity was performed with 50/18 cm in-house packed C18 columns (1.9 \u00b5m C18 beads, Dr. Maisch GmbH). Peptide elution was achieved with a binary solvent system (solvent A: 0.1% formic acid; solvent B: 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) by increasing the relative amount of B from 10 % to 38 % in a linear gradient within 35/20 min, followed by 5/3 min up to 60 % and another 5/2 min to 95%. Re-equilibration was done within 5 min at 5 %. The samples were transferred to an in line coupled QExactive orbitrap/QExactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a nano electrospray ionization source. Full MS spectra were acquired with a data-dependent Top10/15 method that comprised a resolution of 70,000/60,000 at 200 m/z and an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 3e6 at a maximum injection time of 20 ms. The 10/15 most intense ions were further fragmented with higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) at a normalized collision energy of 25/27 and MS\u00b2 spectra were generated at 35,000/30,000 resolution, AGC target of 5e5/1e5 and maximum injection time 120/64 ms.\n\nData from two biological replicates (2 \uf0b4 28 raw files of IgG control and anti-Flag-SINITBAD) were analyzed using MaxQuant (v1.5.5.18) (Cox and Mann, 2008) and the implemented Andromeda search engine (Cox et al., 2011) . Protein assignment was accomplished with correlation of fragment spectra with the UniProt human database (July 2016). Common contaminants were excluded from the analysis. Data processing was performed with tryptic specifications and default settings for mass tolerance in MS and MS/MS spectra. The minimal peptide length was set to 7 amino acids by default and the false discovery rate on protein and peptide level was set to 1 %. Prior to further processing of the data, contaminants, reverse entries and proteins that were only identified by a modification site were filtered out. In order to define high confidence interactors, identified proteins were classified according to criteria given in suppl. Fig. 8A . Proteins from all three groups were combined and constitute the SINTBAD interactome.\n\nThe volcano plots for proteins of group 2a are displayed in suppl. Fig. S13 and were done using the Instant Clue program (Version 0.5.2) (Nolte et al., 2018) . The SINTBAD interactome was analysed by the STRING database version 11.0. Only interactions with a medium confidence score of 0.4 were shown. Line thickness indicates the strength of data support. The assignment of SINTBAD interactors to biological functions and processes was done by combined Genecards, Uniprot and Pubmed searches (www.genecards.org;\n\nwww.uniprot.org; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed). The intrinsic disorder was analyzed using the PONDR prediction tool (http://www.pondr.com) (Peng et al., 2005) and Espritz (Walsh et al., 2012) ."}
