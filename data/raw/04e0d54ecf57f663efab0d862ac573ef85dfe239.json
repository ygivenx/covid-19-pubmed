{"title": "VIRAL INFECTIONS TRANSMITTED THROUGH TISSUE TRANSPLANTATION", "body": "Tissue transplantation therapy, which has been utilised for over 50 years 11 1 , is a rapidly developing field carrying with it great promise for ameliorating or curing many diseases. One of its drawbacks, however, is the potential for donor-to-recipient disease transmission. This risk is greatly reduced by excluding donors at risk of carrying infection and by testing the donor for transmissible infectious disease. Aseptic surgical technique in a quality environment, when removing the tissue from the donor, when processing and storing the tissue and during implantation is critically important to prevent bacterial and fungal contamination. Non-viable tissue grafts such as bone can undergo disinfection and sterilisation steps. During the past two decades the disease transmission risk associated with tissue transplantation has been greatly reduced by implementation of standards set by professional organisations, such as the American Association of Tissue Banks l 21 , the European Association of Tissue Banks (EATB) [ 31 , the Eye Bank Association of America l 41 , and governmental regulations. However, the incidence of transplant-transmitted infection is unknown and the studies needed to determine this have not been performed.\n\nCadaveric donations (Table 1) and clinical transplants (Table 2) of cornea, bone, skin, heart valve, and other tissue allografts in the USA greatly exceed that of organs l 51 . Organ transplantation flourished in the early 1980s following the discovery and introduction of cyclosporin as an effective immune suppressant. This brought a large supply of cadaveric donors available that could also be used for tissue donation. Unlike the limitations of organ transplants, tissue transplantation generally is not limited by HLA histocompatibility barriers l 7 1 or by ABO blood group incompatibility [SJ_ No longer a scarce resource, the widened availability of tissue allografts encouraged new clinical use and brought attention not only to their effectiveness and advantages over autografts but also to their drawbacks, side effects, and complications. One complication of tissue transplantation has been transmission of viral infections of donor origin to the recipient [ 9 ' 101 . Viral infections can be transmitted if the donor has a viral infection and the viral levels are too low for detection. In asymptomatic donors who are recently infected, a transient viremic phase can exist prior to development of a positive donor-screening test for antibodies. Preventing donor-torecipient infectious disease transmission relies heavily on selecting safe donors not only \u00b7 through testing, but also by medical and social behaviour screening to select donors more likely to be free of transmissible infections. In addition, sterilisation with gamma irradiation can be important.\n\nSome tissue allografts, e.g. corneas, heart valves and skin, need to remain viable and cannot be exposed to disinfectants or sterilised without an unacceptable loss of viability. Other grafts are non-viable, largely comprised of acellular connective tissue, and can be disinfected or sterilised more freely resulting in a greater assurance of sterility (Table 3) . This review focuses on viral infections transmitted through transplanted tissues and steps taken for its prevention. \n\nFailure to transmit viral infection from hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive donors has been reported in two recipients of corneas. This suggests that the cornea is inefficient as a mode ofHBV transmission, although in these cases the administration of hepatitis B immune globulin and vaccine to the recipient may have prevented infection 1191 .\n\nKhalil eta/. assessed the presence ofHBsAg and HBV DNA in corneal buttons taken from HBsAg-positive donors 1201 . They found HBV in a small percentage of corneas. Others studied 31 donors infected with HBV or HCV and were unable to detect HBV DNA or HCV RNA in the corneas 1211 . Despite this inefficiency, HBV transmission by corneal transplantation has been reported.\n\nIn earlier reviews by O'Day 1221 and Raber and Friedman 1191 there were brief reports of hepatitis B transmission to cornea recipients from HBsAg positive donors. Two cases of recipient HBV infection after transplants from two different HBsAg-positive donors were eventually reported 1231 . Corneal donations took place from two donors; one in 1984 from an alcoholic man and one in 1985 from an injecting drug user. Tests for HBV were performed on the donor retrospectively after recipients developed HBV infections. Both donors were positive for HBsAg. Only one of the two recipients of corneas from each of the two donors developed symptomatic HBV infection.\n\nThe use of current professional standards and federal regulations would have prevented these cases since exclusion of donors with hepatitis risk behaviours and testing for HBsAg are now required.\n\nRabies virus infection in humans is often found in the cornea. Because of this, a cornea impression test has been useful for early diagnosis 1241 . Corneal allografts are also capable of transmitting rabies. Seven cases of fatal rabies transmission from cornea transplantation have been reJ?:orted in the US, France, Thailand and India during 1979-1988 and in Iran in 1994 12 -311 . The first case involved a 39-year-old man in the US with ascending paralysis 1261 and the second involved a donor in France who died from paraplegia, encephalitis and myocarditis 1 27 1. In 1997 Javadi eta!. and Gode and Bhide each reported rabies developing in two patients who received corneal transplants from the same donor 125 ' 311 . Each of these cadaveric donors had an obvious acute neurological illness clinically consistent with rabies. National professional standards used by tissue banks today prohibit the use of these donors and would have prevented these cases of rabies transmission.\n\nCytomegalovirus does not appear to be readily transmitted by cornea transplantation from seropositive cadaveric donors to seronegative recipients. Of 25 seronegative patients receiving a corneal graft from a seropositive donor, only two seroconverted 1 32 1. Herpes simplex virus, type 1, has been found widespread in corneal stromal cells but only one case of transmission by a cornea allograft has been reported. The infection caused corneal deterioration in the recipient by the fifth day after transplant 1 33 1. HSV DNA was found in two of five cornea allografts from other donors 1 34 1_\n\nHepatitis has been reported from use of unprocessed refrigerated and frozen bone allografts, but not from bone grafts that were cleaned of cells and fat with water jetting and ethanol soaks prior to being freeze dried or treated with sterilants such as gamma irradiation or ethylene oxide. In 1954, prior to the availability of viral hepatitis testing of donors, a Yale medical student received a refrigerated bone graft to treat a depressed fracture of the proximal tibia and developed hepatitis with jaundice 10 weeks later 1351 . The bone graft was obtained from the amputated leg of a patient with occlusive vascular disease and gangrene. Otherwise, the donor was in good health, with normal liver function tests and without a history of jaundice or liver disease. The donor had received blood transfusions 3 years previously.\n\nThree reports from nearly a decade ago documented that hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be transmitted from donor-to-recipient through the use of frozen, unprocessed bone allografts 1 36 \u2022 37 \u2022 381 . In the first case, donor testing for HCV antibodies was not available. HCV was transmitted by the use of a femoral head allograft after it was donated by a donor undergoing hip arthroplasty and stored frozen for 2 months 1361 . In a second report, HCV was transmitted from an infected cadaveric tissue donor through frozen, unprocessed bone and tendon grafts, but not through freeze-dried bone allografts that were treated with gamma irradiation 1381 . In this study, the cadaver bone donor tested negative for HCV antibodies using the first generation test available at the time of donation in 1990, but stored serum tested positive when a new, more sensitive test was introduced in 1992. Testing for HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was also positive. In a third brief report involving five HCV-infected organ and tissue cadaveric donors, a minority of the recipients of frozen bone allografts became infected with HCV 1371 .\n\nIn a more recent case, an HCV-infected organ and tissue donor was tested and found negative for HCV antibodies 139 \u2022 401 . Despite this negative screening test for HCV, several organ and tissue recipients became infected. When blood samples from the donor were tested later for HCV RNA, the results were positive and this confirmed the link between the donor and multiple infected recipients. The donor had been recently infected and was viremic but had not yet produced detectable antibo(,iies. Bone allografts from the same donor that had been treated with gamma irradiation did not transmit HCV. With the implementation ofHCV RNA as a donor-screening test in the future, cases such as this would be prevented.\n\nThere have been no reports of HBV transmission through bone transplantation, although it has been recognised as a complication of organ, cornea, and heart valve transplantation. It is quite probable that there have been transmissions but none have been recognised and published.\n\nHIV-1 has been transmitted through blood, tissues, and organs 1 41 \u2022 42 1. Viable HIV-1 can be recovered from bone, marrow, and tendons of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 143 -461 . In 1984, a fatal HIV-1 infection was transmitted to a woman undergoing spinal fusion for scoliosis through the use of a frozen femoral head allograft several weeks after it had been donated during hip arthroplasty from a donor who had a history of intravenous drug abuse and who had an enlarged lymph node that had been biopsied the previous year [ 471 . Both the donor and the bone allograft recipient subsequently died of AIDS. A test for IITV-1 antibody was not available at the time of donation. This donor would not have been eligible to be a donor today due to his history of intravenous drug abuse and lymphadenopathy. There have been other cases oflllV infection in recipients of bone allograft derived from HIV-infected donors who were not tested for HIV at the time of donation. Prior to HIV antibody test availability in Germany, 12 recipients had frozen bone allo~rafts from an infected cadaveric donor during November 1984 through January 1985 [ 4 1 . Only four of these recipients became HIV positive. Seven remained HIV-negative. In Taiwan a man donated a femoral head during hip replacement surgery but was not tested for mv. The bone allograft was used in a 34-year-old woman in 1996 during knee reconstructive surgery. She seroconverted with lllV antibodies when tested five months later 1 491 .\n\nAnother reported case of lllV transmission through the use of frozen bone allograft involved a seronegative but infected cadaveric donor but the test was new and not veg sensitive. Multiple organs, corneas, bones, and connective tissues were transplanted 142 . Three organ recipients and three recipients of frozen bone and tendon allografts became HIV infected. These allografts had not been sterilised with gamma irradiation or ethylene oxide gas prior to use. The donor tested negative for HIV antibody at the time of donation in October 1985, which was a few months after the first, relatively insensitive HIV antibody testing kits became available. Between 1985 and 1991, there were several modifications that greatly improved test sensitivity. Prior to 1989, HIV antibody was detectable a median of 63 days after initial infection [ 50 ' 511 . A study of HIV infected blood donors between March 1987 and 1991, when whole viral lysate enzyme immunoassays were used to detect HIV antibodies, . showed an average seronegative window period of 45 days 1521 . A report in 1992 showed HIV antibody test kits in use at that time detected twice as many infected individuals as did the test kits available in 1985 [ 531 . Since 1992, lllV antibody tests became even more sensitive, detecting IgM, the earliest form of antibodies, an average of 8-20 days earlier [ 54 \u2022 55 1 and resulting in a seronegative window period of approximately 22 days [ 56 , 571 \u2022 Since then blood donor testing for HIV RNA by nucleic acid testing (NAT) has been implemented and has further reduced the risk of a transfusion and when validated and implemented for cadaver tissue donors will reduce the risk in tissue transplantation [ 581 .\n\nThe prevalence of HIV antibodies in bone donors is low and when the medical history screening and selection processes are applied vigorously, it should not be greatly different from that of voluntary blood donors. This may be true for living bone donors rs 9 -61 1 but not necessarily for cadaveric donors. Of9000 living bone donors who donated femoral heads at the time of hip arthroplasty surgery, none were found to have confirmed positive tests for HIV -1 antibodies at the time of donation [S 9 J. Prevalence of infectious disease markers in surgical bone donors was not different from that of blood donors, except for a higher prevalence of false positive syphilis tests and antibodies to HBV core protein [ 601 . Retesting of 1608 livin~ bone donors 180 days later yielded none with confirmed positive HIV or HCV tests [ 11 . Of 5513 cadaver bone donors tested throughout the United States in 1992, there were three confirmed positive for HIV antibodies [ 621 , but these three were from a single tissue bank that later disclosed accepting donors with risk factors for HIV. A more recent survey by AATB [ 63 1 revealed a higher prevalence rate of infectious disease markers than have been reported for blood donors, with rates ranging from 2 to 40 times higher ( Table 5 ). The addition of viral nucleic acid testing, since 1999, in screening blood donors for HIV and HCV has further reduced the risk from blood donors. First time blood donors have a hi~her infectious disease marker rate and may be more similar to organ and tissue donors 1 6 1.\n\nBecause prospective tissue donors with HIV risk behaviours and positive tests for HIV are excluded and most bone graft processing removes blood and marrow cells and applies disinfectants and sterilants, the risk ofHIV transmission by bone transplantation is now very remote, if not nearly absent [ 651 . The risk of transmittinf HIV through bone grafting has been calculated to be less than one in a million grafts [ 6 \u2022 671 , and is even less if the graft has been subjected to processing and sterilisation steps using gamma irradiation or ethylene oxide. However, the HIV transmission risk is higher in the less frequently used frozen unprocessed bone allograft. An accurate estimate of the risk cannot be made until a more accurate determination of the prevalence ofHIV infection in the donor and recipient population is available and prospective studies have been done on recipients. Human T-Lymphotrophic Virus Asymptomatic HTLV-I infection has been transmitted by transplantation of a freshfrozen unprocessed femoral head bone allograft [ 68 1. A 62-year-old man became infected by HTL V from a blood transfusion in 1987 during hip surgery. One month later he developed fever a rash and a transient right-sided radial nerve palsy. Frozen sera obtained during this illness but tested later demonstrated HTL V seroconversion. In 1991 he donated a femoral head without anti-HTL V testing during a second surgery for a hip prosthesis. The unprocessed frozen femoral head was used as a graft in a different patient one month later. This bone graft recipient developed HTLV-I antibodies but had no HTLV-I associated disease.\n\nCostal cartilage allografts are routinely disinfected or sterilised prior to their use as allografts and provided in a freeze-dried or frozen form. There have been no reports of processed costal cartilage transmitting infection from the donor to the recipient. Donald and Cole surveyed 312 surgeons who used cartilage allografts preserved by 8 different methods for facial reconstructive surgery 1691 . They found a postoperative bacterial infection rate of 19% that was similar to the 16% reported following use of autologous cartilage.\n\nThe use of the patellar tendon allograft to replace the knee's injured anterior cruciate ligament has become commonplace 1701 . HIV has been isolated from tendons in HIV infected persons 143 \u2022 711 and has been transmitted from a seronegative cadaveric tissue donor through a donated patellar tendon used in knee surgery 1421 . HCV was transmitted to recipients of frozen tendon allografts from an anti-HCV positive cadaveric donor 1381 . It is possible that HIV and HCV were harboured in the unprocessed bone blocks at either end of the tendon allograft. These allografts had not been processed to remove blood and marrow cells. Despite these cases, the risk to recipients is presumably low as long as donor-screenin~ steps are applied as required by national standards 12 \u2022 721 and federal regulations 173 -75 . In addition, tendons can be treated with gamma irradiation to further reduce the risk of disease transmission.\n\nSelecting donors without risk factors and without HCV antibodies make the risk of spreading HCV by transplant an exceedingly rare event. However, an early HCV infection in a cadaveric organ and tissue donor not yet producing antibodies was reported recently 139 ' 401 . A patellar tendon allograft recipient developed acute, symptomatic hepatitis C in May 2002, six weeks after transplantation. No other potential sources of infection were identified. The tissue donor was anti-HCV negative but stored serum showed HCV RNA when tested later. Thirty-nine other persons received tissues or organs from this same donor. Early results of a partially completed investigation showed that of 18 recipients tested, six showed HCV infection including a lung recipient who became HCV RNA positive on day 4 and died of liver failure 14 months later. Presumably, the cadaveric donor was in a viremic stage early in infection prior to antibody development. To date cadaveric testing for HCV RNA is not available for routine use. HCV RNA should be considered for cadaveric tissue donors as soon as test reliability has been evaluated particularly using cadaveric samples obtained up to 24 hours after death.\n\nThe capacity of human heart valve allografts to transmit HBV was demonstrated in a study of thirty-one patients who received heart valve allografts from HBsAg-positive donors. Twenty-two recipients were HBsAg-positive prior to transplant or were immune to HBV and not susceptible to HBV infection. . fu addition, they found 10% to have anti-HBc. Fifty-two of 63 donors with anti-HBc also had antibodies to HBV surface protein (anti-HBs), indicating a resolved HBV infection and a recovered, immune noninfectious status. Three of those with anti-HBc but without anti-HBs were positive for HBV DNA using a more sensitive liquid-phase DNA hybridisation assay. This would suggest a possible value of anti-HBc donor testing to prevent transmission of HBV; however, one study of blood donors has shown a lack of predictive value in preventing post-transfusion hepatitis [ 781 . More recently, however, several reports have confirmed that some anti-HBc positive donors will be positive for DNA and will transmit HBV [ 791 .\n\nRecently a case of illY infection transmitted by use of a saphenous vein allograft was reported. The cadaveric donor had no known HlV risk factors or signs of hepatitis and had negative tests for mv antibodies. Subsequent studies demonstrated HCV RNA in the donor serum that was the same serotype, I a, as that found in the donor. The results of donor testing were not known before the skin was used. The authors did not report whether other recipient risk factors were present or the results of confirmation testing. HlV transmission from skin allograft has been recently reviewed [ 84 \u2022 85 1.\n\nTransmission of hepatitis from skin allograft has not been reported although HCV nucleic acid has been demonstrated in skin from infected donors [ 381 . There are recent reports implying transmissibility of human cytomegalovirus (CMV). Animal models clearly demonstrate that skin grafts are capable of transmitting CMV [ 86 ' 891 . Earlier studies by Kealey et al. showed that bum patients acquire CMV during hospitalisation and that blood transfusions may be a contributing factor f90J_ A subsequent study eliminated blood transfusion as a contributor by studying patients who received skin allografts but no CMV-positive blood. They showed that CMV-negative bum patients who receive skin allografts from CMV-positive donors can seroconvert to become CMV-positive [ 911 .\n\nCMV resides in peripheral blood leukocytes in asymptomatic CMV antibodypositive donors long after their initial infection. Asymptomatic CMV -positive donors can transmit CMV infection through transfusion and transplantation if the recipient is CMV negative. Most healthy adult prospective donors have CMV antibodies, and therefore excluding CMV positive donors to prevent CMV transmission would exacerbate the already existing shortage of skin allografts and would not be practical. Testing donors for CMV antibody is not required by national professional standards.\n\nImmunosuppressed individuals such as organ recipients have a high mortality and morbidity rate from transplant-transmitted-CMV of donor origin. The burned patient also acquires CMV infection but does not generally experience serious complications as regularly as organ recipients, perhaps because burn-related immunosuppression may be less profound than that produced by drugs used to prevent organ rejection. As burn patients begin to receive potent immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine to block rejection of skin allografts, CMV may become a more serious complication of burn care and related blood transfusion and skin allografting. Further studies of skin allograft recipients are needed to determine whether transmission of CMV by skin allograft is associated with symptomatic disease as seen in organ transplantation recipients, or is asymptomatic as generally seen in transfusion-transmitted CMV infections in immunocompetent blood transfusion recipients. It is thus premature to assume that it is beneficial to base selection of skin donors on CMV antibody testing. 94 . In addition to being mosquito-borne, WNV has been transmitted through organ transplantation, blood transfusions, transplacental intrauterine spread and percutaneous route from laceration and needlestick [ 941 . A new corona virus infection recently caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and spread across the continents [9 51 . Although the susceptibility of these viruses to gamma irradiation or other sterilants is unknown, the routine use of sterilisation may provide some protection from transmission by tissue transplantation.\n\nTo minimise the risk of transmitting viral infectious disease, several important approaches are taken by transplanting surgeons and tissue banks. An initial approach by the surgeon is to judiciously use tissue allografts only when needed and from accredited organisations, use sterilised allografts whenever possible and consider use of autografts and alternative non-human graft material. However, the most important steps are exercised by the tissue bank in excluding those prospective donors who have known or suspected viral infections or are suspected by their behaviours to be at risk for HIV and hepatitis (Table 5 ). Tissue transplantation is generally considered a non-urgent surgical procedure, permitting a careful tissue donor selection process. Tissue donor selection by tissue banks has evolved to include a direct interview with the donor's next-of-kin concerning the donor's medical history and risk behaviours for HlV and hepatitis along with blood infectious disease testing, a physical examination and the results of an autopsy examination, if performed (Table 6 ). These donor selection steps are essential activities that result in a low risk of transmitting viruses. In addition, many tissue allografts can undergo further processing and exposure to disinfectants or sterilants, all of which further reduce the hazard of disease transmission [ 65 1. Although there have been no carefully controlled studies of allograft recipients to determine the incidence of disease transmission, there is good reason to believe that established donor screening procedures, infectious disease testing and processing and sterilisation effectiveness to reduce or eliminate viruses, results in a very low risk of transmitting disease. \n\nOne important contribution to recipient safety is to seek voluntary, non-remunerated donors. Monetary inducement to the next-of-kin of cadaveric tissue donors is prohibited by professional standards [ 21 but it is being considered as a means of reducing the severe organ supply shortage in the US [ 961 .\n\nMonetary payment to donors for blood donation increases the risk of disease transmission [ 971 . Monetary incentives to donate may cause donors or their next of kin to be untruthful about the donor's health history information and to donate when they should not. Published data clearly show a 5-10 times increased incidence of donor-torecipient post-transfusion hepatitis B virus infection with the use of paid blood donors [ 971 . In addition, there is an 11-15 times increased prevalence ofHCV antibodies and 3-14 times increased prevalence ofHIV antibodies in paid blood donors compared to voluntary blood donors [ 971 . HCV RNA was detected more often in clotting factor concentrates derived from paid donor plasma than volunteer donor plasma [ 98 1_ To minimise the risk of transmitting infectious disease, tissue donor eligibility requirements have been set by national professional standards \u00a3 2 \u2022 4 \u2022 721 , US Public Health Service guidelines 1 99 \u2022 1001 , and US federal regulations [ 73 -751 . Donor selection is an important first step taken to ensure that the resulting allograft is safe and effective. The cadaver tissue donor selection process includes a donor's medical and social history obtained from the next-of-kin and medical care providers, blood tests, a physical examination performed by tissue bank personnel, and an autopsy, if performed (Table 6 ). Preliminary donor selection is based on the donor's medical history and circumstances surrounding death. Donors are excluded if elements of the past medical and social history or recent hospitalisation indicate a risk of infection, malignant disease, or inadequate quality of donated organ or tissue. The living donor, the legal consenting next-of-kin or life partner of a cadaveric donor, or both, must be directly interviewed to determine whether IDV or hepatitis risk behaviours are present (Table 5) . Persons with lllV and hepatitis risk behaviours are excluded from donation. The tissue bank physician makes the final determination of suitability of a cadaveric tissue donor as required by national professional standards \u00a3 2 \u2022 72 1.\n\nThe next screening step is a limited physical examination of the tissue donor by procurement staff at the time of cadaveric donation [ 2 \u2022 721 . The body is examined for signs of injecting drug use and signs oflllV, hepatitis or other infection or trauma over bodily sites that can affect the quality of donated tissue.\n\nDonor blood testing for disease markers plays an important role in reducing the risk of disease transmission. By eliminating prospective donors with infectious disease risk factors prior to blood testing, the risk of a seronegative but infected donor is minimised. Testing for HBsAg, anti-IDV, and anti-HCV is required by federal regulations [ 73 \" 75 1 and national professional standard setting organizations \u00a3 2 \u2022 4 \u2022 721 . Other tests required by standard setting organizations are syphilis and anti-HTLV-I/ll \u00a3 2 \u2022 4 \u2022 72 1.\n\nIDV antigen (p24 antigen) testing of the donor is not performed by most tissue or organ banks. Large-scale studies of low risk [I0 1 J and high risk \u00a3 102 1 blood donor populations demonstrated a lack of utility for IDV antigen screening. These blood donor studies and similar studies on smaller numbers of cadaver bone \u00a3 1031 and cornea [ 1041 donors did not detect HIV infected donors beyond those already detected by testing for lllV antibodies. However, some regions of the world may have a higher prevalence oflllV infection and in these populations IDV antigen testing may be useful, especially if lllV RNA testing is not performed. One tissue bank has reported finding bone donors with negative tests for IDV antibodies but positive tests for lllV antigen. Presumably these IDV antigen tests were not false positive. The bone bank has added the precaution of treating all bone allografts with 2.5 Mrad gamma irradiation l 105 l.\n\nStudies are underway to determine whether testing donors for IDV RNA and HCV RNA by nucleic acid testing is practical. One study of 1424 cadaver bone donors showed that the use oflllV DNA (not lllV RNA) and p24 antigen blood testing did not detect additional illY infected cadaveric bone donors [lOJJ_ Alll424 donors negative for IDV-1 antibodies were also negative for lllV DNA. This is what is expected since the appearance of IDV DNA in a recently infected person's blood does not occur sooner that the onset of detectable antibodies. On the other hand, lllV RNA appears earlier and has a greater potential benefit. Although HIV RNA testing is more sensitive than antibody assays, it may be premature to apply it routinely to cadaver donor testing due to the low HIV prevalence in the donor population, its uncertain predictive value, its false positive rate, and its false negative rate due to haemoglobin contamination and other potentially interfering substances in cadaveric post-mortem blood samples.\n\nTesting of living blood donors for HIV and HCV RNA has markedly improved the safety of the blood supply even though screening has been done using pools of 16 to 24 samples rssJ. Initially, viral nucleic acid testing was not feasible in blood donor screening applications due to lack of automation, time and space restrictions and cost. Recently, however, test systems are being used to test over 13 million blood donations annually in the United States: the Roche Molecular Systems COBAS AMPLISCREEN tests for HCV and HIV and the Gen-Probe/Chiron Pooled Plasma HIV-1/HCV Amplified Assay. Testing is being done on pooled samples using pools of 24 or 16. Testing of pooled samples reduces the number of tests required on a daily basis, the time to perform testing and the cost. It also takes into account the rapid rise of viral RNA in recently infected individuals so that pooling has a minimal impact on the sensitivity of these assays. The increased sensitivity of these systems over previously available PCR tests has also made this possible. Both systems have now been licensed for blood donor screening and efforts are underway to qualify them for organ and tissue donor screening. The same approach is now being tested in trials for HBV and WNV.\n\nMany bone banks test donors for anti-HBc, a test originally introduced for blood donors as a surrogate for detecting non-A, non-B hepatitis carriers. The utility of this test as a surrogate has been diminished since adding specific tests for HCV (HCV antibodies and HCV RNA), the major cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis [ 781 . Although not required by AATB Standards and in the absence ofHBV DNA testing, the use of anti-HBc in donor testing likely had a safety benefit in reducing HBV infections. Several reports have documented the presence of HBV in the sera of HBsAg-negative, anti-HBc-positive blood donors [ 79 ' 106 ' 1071 . These reports also suggest that the addition of HBV DNA testing will increase the sensitivity of HBV detection but may not entirely replace the need to test for anti-HBc or HBsAg. For example, recipient directed lookback procedures have revealed recipients of HBsAg negative, NAT negative, anti HBc-positive blood components to have been infected with HBV f 79 l.\n\nMassive blood loss and intravascular volume replacement by transfusion of blood, colloid, and crystalloid solutions can cause hemodilution and result in unreliable donor test results for infectious diseases (IOSJ. In 1987 a case was reported ofHIV transmission to multiple recipients of organs derived from an infected donor. Testing of the donor was negative when blood was sampled immediately after receiving blood transfusions amounting to two to three total blood volumes and an additional large volume of crystalloid solution over an eleven-hour period [ 1091 . When a blood sample was obtained 48 hours later was tested for anti-HIV, it was positive due to intravascular replenishment of immunoglobulin from extravascular sites.\n\nIn 1993 US federal regulations f?JJ were first published, with subsequent modification [ 74 ' 751 , requiring quarantine of tissue from adult donors who had blood loss and received greater than two litres of blood and colloids within 48 hours of blood sampling or greater than one litre of crystalloid within a one hour of sampling. The donated tissue was not to be used unless a pre-transfusion sample was available for testing or an algorithm used to evaluate blood and colloid volumes administered in the 48 hours prior to sampling to ensure sufficient plasma dilution to alter test results has not occurred. AATB Standards also require . tissue banks to follow written procedures setting hemodilution limits to prevent use of false negative results when testing posttransfusion blood samples for infectious disease 121 . Acceptability limits must be part of written procedures. Standards of the American Red Cross Tissue Services require that in the case of blood loss and transfusion within 48 hours of death, a pre-infusion sample must be used 1721 . A post-infusion sample may be used in patients with major clinical blood loss provided that the tissue bank physician has evaluated whether blood and crystalloid infusions have compensated for blood loss, estimated hemodilution is 50 percent or less of the total blood volume and the tissue bank physician gives written approval. The estimated amount of hemodilution depends upon the type of fluid infused and the amount of time elapsed since infusion.\n\nThe testing of cadaveric tissue donor serum for viral markers may be complicated by false positive tests when sampling is delayed after death 11041 or when there is haemolysis [ 53 ' 1041 . False positive results for HBsAg and p24 antigen due to haemolysis may be found depending upon which manufacturer's test kit is used 1531 . Sample quality and presence of haemoglobin can also cause false negative results when testing for IDV and HCV by NAT [IIO,lllJ_ Frozen storage and multiple freeze-thaws do not have a major effect on detectability of antibodies to infectious agents in serum, but they may reduce the reliability of testing for microbial nucleic acids by NAT. Busch et al. showed that multiple freeze thaws can reduce the detectability of HCV RNA by NAT [ll2J_ Published studies are too few to draw any firm conclusions, other than a possible deleterious effect of frozen storage and freeze thawing on testing serum for HCV RNA and peripheral blood white cells for ffiV DNA by NAT. Despite this, NAT was used to detect and retrospectively diagnose HIV infection using marrow specimens from an organ and tissue donor and frozen sera from organ recipients 5 years after the donation and transplantation 1421 \u2022 HCV testing by NAT was also useful in confirming HCV infection in one cadaveric donor 1381 and was essential in another 1391 . Although NAT for hepatitis and IDV will be very useful, the tests are under development for organ and tissue donor testing.\n\nAutopsies of donors are not generally required but for those tissues that can be stored, a final donor suitability determination is not made by the tissue bank physician until the results of the autopsy, if performed, have been reviewed [Z, 72 J. Autopsy findings may not be reliable in detecting viral infections but results have disqualified donors with undiagnosed malignancy, widespread granulomas, abscess, and pneumonia.\n\nFemoral heads can be donated by persons undergoing hip arthroplasty. Donor medical history screening and testing requirements are similar to those for cadaver bone donors, except that the donor medical history interview can be made directly and a retest for IDV and HCV antibodies is required 180 days following donation 1 2 \u2022 72 \u2022 99 \u2022 100 1. The retest aims to identify recently infected donors who were seronegative for IDV and HCV antibodies at the time of donation. This 180 day retest is required for semen and bone donors but not for living donors of blood, marrow, amnion, umbilical veins, or foetal tissue. Retesting the low risk voluntary living bone donors has not detected any additional infections despite thousands of donations and retests [ 611 , whereas it may have utility in the higher risk population of paid semen donors. Most tissue banks have ceased collecting surgical femoral heads, partly due to lower quality, but also due to the difficulties of acquiring the 180-day sample for retesting. Testing of samples for HCV and mv RNA from living donors at the time of donation would enhance safety and could eliminate the need for a 180-day retest.\n\nTissue allografts can be contaminated by bacteria or fungus during processing from environment surfaces and air, from personnel, from contaminated reagents, surgical instruments, supplies and processing equipment.\n\nIn cases of mv and HCV transmission by tissue allografts, the origin of the virus has been from infection of the donor. Electrolyte solutions purchased commercially [ll3J or deionised water prepared by the tissue bank [ 1141 can be contaminated by bacteria and contaminate the tissue allograft when used for processing. In rare cases, there has been HBV contamination acquired during liquid nitrogen storage [ 1151 . This has led to the widespread practice of using the vapour phase rather than submersion in the liquid phase. Viral contamination during tissue processing has not been reported.\n\nThe bone graft disinfection and sterilisation step most often used by bone banks in the United States is gamma irradiation at doses of 15 to 30 kGy [ 1161 . For several types of tissue, processing steps involve elimination of blood cells and exposure to disinfectants such as alcohol and peroxide, both of which have viral inactivation properties. The use of sterilants such as gamma irradiation, ethylene oxide and heat, are more reliable for eradicating viable viruses.\n\nTransplantation of tissues has resulted in transmitting viral diseases from donor to recipient. When the first truly effective immunosuppressant, cyclosporin, became available in 1981, organ transplantation flourished. The numbers of organs transplanted each year grew rapidly leading to implementation of effective programs to develop public support for organ donation. As organ donation grew, so did tissue donation. With the rapid growth of transplantation, early cases of transplant transmitted viral diseases arose from infections of the donor but could have been prevented if tests were available. The use of new and more sensitive donor viral detection tests has reduced the risk of recipient infections.\n\nEarly cases of transmitted viral infection involved donors who had mv and hepatitis risk behaviours. Exclusion of these as prospective donors has played an important role in reducing the risk of transmission. More recently, several cases have been reported where the infecting organism is bacterial and fungal instead of viral and the microbes did not arise from the donor but was a contaminant acquired during the procurement, processing or storage of the tissue. Newer national professional standards and US FDA regulations are addressing this area.\n\nTo prevent, or at least minimise, the risk of transmission of infectious disease, several approaches are important. Surgeons should use allografts only when needed and obtain them from accredited tissue banks. They should consider use of autografts, alternative nonhuman graft material, or processed and sterilised tissue allografts whenever possible tissue banks reduce the risk for rejecting those donors suspected to be at risk for HIV, hepatitis, or other viral or bacterial infections, performing a donor physical examination, reviewing autopsy reports, and the surgical removal of donated tissue using aseptic technique. Lastly, sterilisation of certain tissues can be very effective, but it is not universally applicable, because some viruses are relatively resistant to sterilants and because the clinical effectiveness of many tissues (such as skin, cornea, valves, veins) can be altered by sterilisation procedures [ll7J_ Application of all these steps will assure a very low risk of transmitting disease from the donor to the recipient."}
