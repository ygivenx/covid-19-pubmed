Middle -Coding potential in the three reading frames (indicated by the three colors corresponding to the genome map colors). Positive scores indicate that the sequence is likely to be coding in the given reading frame. Bottom -Analysis of conservation at polyprotein-frame synonymous sites. The red line shows the probability that the observed conservation could occur under a null model of neutral evolution at synonymous sites, whereas the brown line depicts the ratio of the observed number of substitutions to the number expected under the null model. MLOGD is generally more appropriate for detecting non-overlapping ORFs whereas SYNPLOT2 is appropriate for detecting overlapping ORFs (pink arrow). Other peaks in synonymous site conservation likely correspond to functional RNA elements embedded within the polyprotein coding sequence (cf. ref. 2 Top -Genome map of reference sequence indicating the polyprotein ORF (blue) and the putative additional ORF (orange).
