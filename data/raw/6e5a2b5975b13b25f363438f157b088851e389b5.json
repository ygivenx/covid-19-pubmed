{"title": "C-type lectins do not act as functional receptors for filovirus entry into cells", "body": "Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) are enveloped negative-strand RNA viruses that constitute the family Filoviridae. Filovirus infection causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates and mortality rates have ranged up to 90%. Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) has caused multiple large outbreaks with the highest mortality rates (~90%) among EBOV species. Among MARVs, strain Angola (MARV-A) caused the largest outbreak in 2004-05 in Angola, with the highest mortality rate (90%) [1] .\n\nIt has been shown that the filovirus entry into host cells depends on endosomal acidification [2, 3] and proteolysis of the glycoprotein (GP) by endosomal cysteine proteases like cathepsin B and/or L [4] . Filovirus GP is the only spike protein on the surface of the virion, and therefore GP is responsible for both receptor binding and membrane fusion. GP is comprised of two molecules, GP1 and GP2, which are linked by a disulfide bond. GP1 contains a putative receptor binding region (RBR) [5, 6] and a mucin-like region (MLR) that has a number of potential N-and O-linked glycosylation sites [7, 8] . GP2 has a transmembrane domain, cytoplasminc tail and an internal fusion loop [1] . GP1, in particular MLR, is highly glycosylated by both N-and O-glycans, and these glycans are thought to be recognized by cellular C-type lectins such as liver-specific C-type lectin asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) [9, 10] , dendritic cell-and liver/lymph node-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN and L-SIGN) [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , human macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin (hMGL) [18, 19] , and liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin (LSECtin) [12, 17] . Though these C-type lectins show different specificities, depending on the structures of target glycans, all have been reported to promote filovirus entry. Hepatocytes, dendritic cells, monocytes and macrophages are thought to be the preferred target cells of filoviruses, and infection of these cells is important for hemorrhagic manifestation and immune disorders [20] [21] [22] [23] . Thus, increased infection of these cells might be directly involved in the pathogenesis of filovirus infection [18, 24] .\n\nThough the C-type lectins have been reported to enhance filovirus infection, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN did not confer susceptibility for EBOV to non-susceptible cells, i.e. CD4+T-cells [11] and Ramons B cells [14] . In readily susceptible cells, it was reported that the internalization of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN themselves was not essential for trafficking EBOV into endosomal compartments [14] . These studies suggest that C-type lectins promote the filovirus entry by enhancing the virion attachment on the cell surface but not by enhancing the virion internalization. However, it has not been clarified yet whether C-type lectins independently act as a functional receptor mediating all the steps of viral entry including attachment, internalization, and membrane fusion. In the present study, to confirm the role of the C-type lectins in filovirus entry, we generated mutant GPs whose RBRs were impaired, and examined their abilities to infect C-type lectin-expressing cells without the interaction between RBR and its unknown putative counterpart(s).\n\n293T, Vero E6, and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, and antibiotics. HepG2 cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, Lglutamine, and antibiotics. K562 cell clones expressing hMGL (K562/hMGL), DC-SIGN (K562/DC-SIGN), and mock transfected (K562/mock) were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, L-glutamine, and antibiotics.\n\nConstruction of mutant GPs was done as previously described [18] . The modified GP genes were then ligated into pCAGGS and used to express GPs on 293T cells. Vesicular stomatitis virus expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (VSV\u0394G*) pseudotyped with GP was generated in 293T cells as previously described [2, 18] .\n\nAnti-ZEBOV GP monoclonal antibody (MAb) 42/3.7 recognizing a linear epitope (amino acid positions 286-296) of ZEBOV GP [25] , anti-MARV-A GP MAb 127-8 recognizing a linear epitope (amino acid positions 410-430) of MARV-A GP [25] , and anti-VSV matrix protein (M) MAb 192/1 [18] were used for detection of the proteins. Peroxidase-conjugated AffiPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Immobilon Western (Millipore) were used for visualization of the protein bands. Intensities of specific bands were measured with ImageJ [26] .\n\nVSV\u0394G* pseudotyped with GPs was purified by ultracentrifugation through a 25% sucrose cushion and diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The GP amounts in the VLPs were quantified by Western blotting using MAb ZGP42/3.7 or AGP127-8, and standardized based on the band intensities. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates were coated with the diluted viruses (2 mg/ml) and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. After each well was washed with Dulbecco's Tris-buffered saline (dTBS), biotinylated soluble recombinant hMGL (hMGL ECD) or DC-SIGN (DC-SIGN ECD) [18] in dTBS was added. To detect C-type lectins bound to the viruses, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) were used.\n\nWe first constructed RBR-deletion mutant GPs of ZEBOV GP (\u039454-149, \u039454-227, \u039454-313, \u039489-149, \u039489-227, and \u039489-313) and MARV-A GP (\u039438-188, \u039438-308, \u039460-188, and \u039460-308) (Fig. 1A) , and viruses pseudotyped with these mutant GPs were generated. Lysates of GP-expressing 293T cells and culture supernatants containing pseudotyped viruses were examined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis to verify the expression and the virion incorporation of the GPs (Table 1) . Though MAbs 42/3.7 and 127-8 failed to react with ZEBOV GP\u039454-313, ZEBOV GP\u039489-313, MARV-A GP\u039438-308, and MARV-A GP\u039460-308, the other mutant GPs were detected by these antibodies. Although ZEBOV GP\u039454-149, ZEBOV GP\u039489-149, MARV-A GP\u039438-188, and MARV-A GP\u039460-188 showed significantly lower band intensities than wild-type GP, the expression on 293T cells and incorporation into the virion of these mutant GPs were verified. We then tested the infectivity of VSV\u0394G* pseudotyped with GPs in the various cell lines (Fig. 1B) . The infectivity of VSV\u0394G* bearing the RBR-deletion mutant GPs was undetectable or significantly lower than VSV\u0394G* bearing wild-type GPs in all the cells tested, including the C-type lectin-expressing cells. These results indicated that GPs lacking RBR did not confer the sufficient infectivity to VSV\u0394G*, even when the C-type lectins existed on the target cell surface.\n\nHowever, deletion of entire RBR polypeptides might cause not only a defect of binding ability to the putative functional receptor but also defects in other essential functions such as membrane fusion. Therefore we constructed mutant ZEBOV GPs with single amino acid substitutions in RBR, which were reported to impact the receptor binding capacity, leading to reduced infectivity [27] [28] [29] . Based on the amino acid sequence alignment between ZEBOV and MARV-A GPs, MARV-A mutant GPs that had corresponding mutations were also constructed ( Table 1 ). The expression and virion incorporation of each mutant GP were compared with those of wild-type GPs by Western blot analysis (Table 1) . Consistent with previous studies [27] [28] [29] , all the mutant GPs were expressed and incorporated into the virion except MARV-A GP Y146A. The infectivity of the VSV\u0394G* pseudotyped with mutant GPs was tested in the same cell lines used in Fig. 1 (Fig. 2) . As expected, almost all mutant ZEBOV GPs conferred lower infectivity to VSV\u0394G* in Vero E6, 293, and K562/mock cells than wild-type ZEBOV GP. Similarly, mutations in MARV-A GP (L41A and G127A) significantly reduced the infectivities of the viruses. In the C-type lectin-expressing cells (HepG2, K562/hMGL, and K562/DC-SIGN), the infectivities of the viruses bearing the mutant GPs were also lower than those of the viruses with wild-type GPs, and were likely reduced parallel to the infectivities in Vero E6, 293, and K562/mock cells. These results suggested that the reduced infectivity caused by the mutations in RBR could not be complemented by the interaction between the glycans on GP and C-type lectins.\n\nIn a lectin-binding assay using pseudotyped viruses and soluble recombinant hMGL (hMGL ECD) and DC-SIGN (DC-SIGN ECD), we further confirmed that the binding capacities of GPs to these lectins were not significantly reduced by the mutations that gave the lowest infectivities to VSV\u0394G* in K562/hMGL and K562/DC-SIGN (i.e., F88A and L41A of ZEBOV and MARV-A GPs, respectively) (Fig. 3) . This finding indicated that there was no remarkable correlation between GP binding capacity to C-type lectins and reduced infectivity of the viruses with the mutant GPs, and suggested a limited contribution of the interaction between C-type lectin and GP to the subsequent steps in filovirus entry.\n\nIn the present study, we demonstrated that the structure of RBR was essential for the entry of filoviruses even when C-type lectins existed on the cell surface, suggesting that the Ctype lectins were not independently able to mediate filovirus entry into cells. Therefore, we conclude that C-type lectin-mediated entry of filoviruses requires other cellular molecule(s) that may be critical for virion internalization and/or membrane fusion. Identification of the unknown ubiquitous receptor(s) or coreceptor(s) is essential for further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of filovirus cellular entry and may provide information on the link to the tropism and pathogenesis of filovirus infection. Binding capacity of the C-type lectins to VSV\u0394G* pseudotyped with MARV GPs. ELISA plates were coated with purified VSV\u0394G* bearing mutant GPs. Biotinylated recombinant soluble hMGL ECD (2.5 mg/ml) and DC-SIGN ECD (2.5 mg/ml) were incubated with the viruses and visualized as described in Materials and Methods. All experiments were done in triplicate, and average results and standard deviations are shown.
