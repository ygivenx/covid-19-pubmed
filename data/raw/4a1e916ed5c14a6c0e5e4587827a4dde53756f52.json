{"title": "Multifacility Outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in Taif, Saudi Arabia", "body": "In October 2014, fifteen cases of MERS-CoV infection were identified among outpatients (n = 11) and staff (n = 4) at the dialysis unit of Hospital B in Taif, Saudi Arabia. Hospital B is a 500-bed tertiary Ministry of Health hospital in Taif Governorate, Makkah Region, Saudi Arabia, and has an associated but physically separate outpatient renal dialysis unit. Serologic analysis was performed on serum samples of PCR-positive MERS patients and of healthcare personnel (HCP) in the dialysis unit of Hospital B. HCP with potential exposure to MERS patients were identified. Enrolled HCP provided written informed consent and completed a brief, standardized questionnaire to gather information about demographics, job duties, symptom information, and specific exposures to MERS-CoV patients during the period of suspected transmission.\n\nFollowing a period of >3 weeks, a blood specimen (<20 mL) was collected from each HCP for serologic detection of antibodies to MERS-CoV. Blood specimens were centrifuged to separate sera, which were transported to the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health and to CDC for antibody and rRT-PCR testing. Demographic and clinical characteristics were reported, and differences were assessed for significance (p = 0.05) by using \u03c7 2 test, Fisher exact test, and t-test, as appropriate. All data were analyzed by using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).\n\nSeventy HCP were identified as having had exposure to the dialysis unit of Hospital B during the period of suspected transmission (October 1-31). Interviews by using a standardized questionnaire were conducted and serum samples collected on November 24, 2014. Of the 70 identified HCP, 62 (89%) provided serum specimens, and 38 (54%) completed exposure assessments. Demographics of respondents with completed assessments and those without assessments did not were similar. For the 38 respondents with available information, the median age was 32 years (range 25-61). Twenty-five (66%) of the 38 were female, and 29 (76%) were Page 2 of 3 nurses. The 38 respondents also included 5 (13%) housekeeping staff, 2 (6%) biomedical technicians, 1 (3%) physician, and 1 (3%) pharmacist. Most (82% and 79%, respectively) came within 1 meter of a patient, touched a patient, or both.\n\nSerum samples from 4 (6.5%) of 62 exposed HCP (2 nurses, 1 physician, and 1 housekeeper) were positive by the MERS-CoV N ELISA used for initial MERS-CoV screening, and all were confirmed positive by immunofluourescence and microneutralization assays. Of the 4 identified seropositive HCP, 3 denied any assessed symptom and had not been previously recognized as infected with MERS-CoV. The remaining seropositive HCP was 1 of four previously identified symptomatic HCP from the dialysis unit of Hospital B. Of the remaining 3 previously identified rRT-PCR-positive, dialysis-related HCP, 2 completed exposure assessments but declined blood draw, and 1 was unavailable for exposure assessment or serologic testing. Of 62 serum samples from the dialysis unit HCP serosurvey, all were rRT-PCR negative.\n\nOf the 70 HCP identified as having exposure to the dialysis unit during the transmission period, 7 (10%) had rRT-PCR or serologic evidence of MERS-CoV infection; 5 of these 7 completed exposure assessments. Among the 38 HCP who completed exposure assessments and provided serum specimens, demographic information and exposures were similar between seropositive and seronegative participants (data not shown).\n\nOur serologic investigation of the dialysis unit HCP identified 3 additional, previously unrecognized seropositive HCP, who denied symptoms at interview. Overall, 18 persons (11 patients and 7 HCP) were found to be involved in the dialysis unit transmission event. Our serosurvey of HCP in the dialysis unit was limited by the small number of seropositive participants and did not reveal risk factors for transmission among HCP. The spike open reading frame sequence obtained from patient 33 also contained a single synonymous nucleotide substitution at position 1,335 (T>C) that differed from other Taif sequences but that was present among some published sequences (not shown in this Table) . Spike open reading frame nucleotides 1-4,062 and amino acids, 1-1,353. #MERS-CoV antibody positivity was defined as a positive result by the MERS-CoV N ELISA and confirmatory positive results by the MERS-CoV immunofluourescence and microneutralization assays. Serum samples that were negative by MERS-CoV N ELISA were considered negative for MERS-CoV antibodies. **Glu536Lys, Asp537Glu and Thr560Ile located in the spike protein receptor-binding subdomain as described by Wang et al.
