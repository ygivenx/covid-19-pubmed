Further bacteriological and viral advanced molecular testings were performed in specialized laboratories of partner universities in Hamburg, Bonn, Gie\u00dfen, M\u00fcnster, and T\u00fcbingen (Germany).\n\nIn blood: antigen detecting rapid diagnostic tests were used: Paracheck Pf dipstick All these points of care tests were performed according to manufacturers' instructions.\n\nThick blood smears were applied for malaria microscopic diagnosis. Staining was done by 20 minutes immersion into a 10% Giemsa solution and Plasmodium spp. asexual forms were determined by the Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9 method as described elsewhere 1 . Urine and stool cultures were performed using the procedures described in the respective microbiology laboratories specific standard operating procedures (SOPs). A urine culture was considered positive if it yielded \uf0b3100,000 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL).\n\nFor blood culture, between 1 and 3 mL of blood was collected in Bactec Peds Plus culture bottles and incubated in a Bactec 9050 blood culture system (BD Biosciences). Positive samples were cultured on blood agar, chocolate agar, and cysteine-, lactose-, and electrolyte-deficient agar. Suspicious colonies were subjected to species identification using API-E test strips (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). In Germany, both species confirmation and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were done using Vitek 2 automated test systems (bioM\u00e9rieux) and EUCAST breakpoints. \n\nAll samples underwent an initial screening for Plasmodium infection done by Pan-Plasmodium reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay as reported elsewhere 18 .\n\nFor the identification of malaria species would be processed in two subsequent steps:\n\nStep 1: In order to be used as a template for quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay, all samples initially positive by the Pan-Plasmodium RT-qPCR assay underwent a conventional PCR amplification following a protocol described earlier 19 . The volume for this amplification was set to 50\u00b5L containing: 7.5 \u00b5L of nucleic acids extract, 300\u00b5M of each primer (PLU5 and PLU6), 1X Qiagen PCR buffer with 1\u00b75mM MgCl2, 250 \u00b5M dNTPs each, and 1U Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, cat #201223). The following cycling conditions were used: denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes, then by series of 20 cycles (95\u00b0C for 30 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1:20 min) and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes.\n\nStep 2: For the diagnosis of Plasmodium spp. infections primers and probes P. malariae, P. ovale curtisi, P. ovale wallikeri, for P. falciparum and for P. vivax 20 were developed for that purpose. The monoplex qPCR assay was performed for the following human malaria species: P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale curtisi, P. ovale wallikeri, and P. vivax using the LightCycler 480 Instrument II (Roche Applied Science). Each qPCR assay was made of 2.5\u00b5L of the pre-amplified product, 1X SensiMix II Probe No-ROX, 300\u00b5M of each primer pair, and 150 \u00b5M of each probe per 10\u00b5L final reaction volume. The cycling conditions were as follows: polymerase activation for 10 min at 94\u00b0C, followed by 45 cycles of (10 seconds at 95\u00b0C and for 60 seconds at 60\u00b0C). All samples, along with nontemplate control (NTC) and positive control, were tested in duplicate. The LightCycler 480 software (version 1.5.1.62) automatically calculated and generated the quantification threshold cycle value (Ct) using the second derivative maximum method integrated.\n\nPositivity was assessed visually by analyzing the amplification curves for variability between each sample replicates (SD \u2264 1 cycle) and the quantification threshold value less than 40 (Ct <40). All the assays were tested and validated in accordance with MIQE guidelines 21 .\n\nChest X-rays were performed on-site in the context of clinical activities performed routinely during pediatric care. All the features considered as abnormal findings were interpreted using the standardized interpretation of pediatric chest radiographs for the The title describes the study design as \"a cross-sectional hospital-based study\".\n\n(b) Provide in the abstract an informative and balanced summary of what was done and what was found\n\nThe abstract describes what was done and found in its Methods subsection.\n\nBackground/rationale 2 Explain the scientific background and rationale for the investigation being reported\n\nThe background and rationale are described in paragraph 1 of the Introduction section.\n\nObjectives 3 State specific objectives, including any prespecified hypotheses\n\nThe specific objectives of the study are stated in paragraph 2 of the Introduction section.\n\nPresent key elements of study design early in the paper\n\nThe study design is presented in the Abstract [\"Methods\" section] and in the \"Study design and setting\" subsection of the Methods section.\n\nDescribe the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including periods of recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data collection\n\nThe study setting is described in the \"Study design and setting\" subsection of the Methods section.
