{"title": "Case fatality rate of novel coronavirus disease 2019 in China 1", "body": "should be corrected as cases at T days before, where T is an average time period from case 67 confirmation to death. This study aims to calculate the CFR of the COVID-19 in China by 68 estimating the average time period from case confirmation to death. it should be realized that deaths at day X are averagely from cases at day X-T rather than day 75 X. Given a T value, a group of CFRs (daily CFRs) can be obtained from different X days. As 76 known that death number at day X should be less than case number at day X-T (if more than 77 day X-T, CFR would be greater than 100% which is illogical). Based on this point, the range 78 of T can be narrowed. More importantly, no matter what T value is assumed, even it is far 79 away from the true T value, the daily CFRs would converge towards (infinitely approach to 80 but never be over) the true CFR with time (X) increases. The following example will illustrate 81 this principle (Table 1) . Assuming CFR = 10%, T = 4 for a disease, the cases number was 82 from 100 to 10000 at day X (X=1 to 100), then the deaths number would be 10 (10, 20 and so 83 on) at day X+4 (5, 6 and so on). When calculating daily CFRs based on case and death 84 numbers with formula deaths (X) divided by cases (X-T), law 1: if assumed T was equal to 85 the true T value (4 in the example), calculated daily CFRs at different day X would constantly 86 be the true CFR (0.1); if assumed T was greater than the true T (5 and 6), daily CFRs would 87 be greater than the true CFR (0.1) and infinitely reduce to near it with the time (X) increased; 88 .

After 104 different T values were tried, as Figure 1 showed, when assumed T was 11, the daily CFRs 105 were decreasing and had no pronounced increase, when it was 0 to 7; the daily CFRs had 106 pronounced increase after early time (T > 11 were not shown due to continuously decreasing 107 trends). CFRs increased as expected according to laws at later stage in some assumed T 108 values (e.g. T=0), but it decreased at early stage which seemed not satisfy the convergence 109 laws. Actually, it was normal. Convergence laws happened due to the force of the true CFR 110 drawing daily CFRs towards its direction by dominating accumulated death numbers. At early 111 stage, the outcome of death had not yet occurred resulting in daily CFRs decreasing with the 112 growth of case number. Thus, T value exploration by convergence laws should depend on 113 period of death growth. 114\n\nResults of Figure 1 indicated the true T should be in the range of 8 to 10. As differences 115 between CFRs were too small at converging stage to compare and scales of y axis in different 116 .

If assumed T 127 was equal to the true T value, calculated daily CFRs would keep constant. As Figure 2  128 showed, for T= 11 and 8, comparing with T = 9 and 10, CFRs still had slightly decreasing and 129 increasing trends, respectively. Linear models (blue lines) were generated for analysis of 130 variances and linear trends of theses CFR points in each plot. The slopes of models became 131 flatter and approached towards to 0 when T was from 8 to 9 and 11 to 10. The results 132 indicated the true T should be bigger than 8 and less than 11. When T = 9, the CFRs were 133 almost staying in one line (red dotted line in Figure 2 ) and slightly increased later. When T = 134 10, though the daily CFRs decreased early but quickly they reached a stable stage. So the true 135 T might be between 9 and 10 days. The mean values of data in plot 9 and 10 of Figure 2 were 136 0.8% and 0.9%, respectively. The true CFR of COVID-19 in China except Hubei Province 137 should fall between 0.8% and 0.9%. An assumed T was the closer to the true T value, the 138 earlier daily CFRs converging to the true CFR happened. The mean value of CFRs at later 139 stage of plot 9 or 10 was approximately 0.85%. As shown in Figure 2 , if data was analyzed 140 before Feb 20, T = 9 (0.81%) might be determined as the true T value (true CFR). But now 141 the T was postponed to between 9 and 10 days. The reason was not the uncertainty of method, 142 but the long disease course of COVID 19. Time of case confirmation to outcome was longer 143 in some cases than most which caused the true T bigger and CFR slightly increased. For (only sporadic cases were reported recently in the non-Hubei regions), so far, the naive CFR 148 .

Red dotted line and number were the estimated true CFR. 156\n\nAs shown in Table 2 , after Feb 3, death number (350) were more than Jan 21 case 158 number (270), if the T was 12 (Feb 3 minus Jan 1), the CFR would be illogically greater than 159 100%. In another words, death numbers only when before day 12 were less than case number 160 at day 1. So the time T should be less than or equal to 11 days (12-1). The death number when 161 was firstly more than the case number at day 2 was Feb 5 (day 15), so the T should be less 162 than or equal to 12 (14-2). The rest could be done in the same manner. Finally, the smallest T 163 value (T = 11) was selected as the upper limit for convergence screening. 164 Figure 3 was the calculation of daily CFRs with assumed T values (0 to 11). When 165 assumed T was 8 to 11, daily CFRs were continuously decreasing. When T = 0 and 3, there 166\n\nwere increase trends at later stage which meant they were smaller than the true T value. 167\n\nConverging stage CFRs data when T = 4 to 7 was selected for plotting with the same y axis 168 scales ( Figure 4) . As it showed, For T= 4, CFRs had increase trends, and T = 5, the CFRs 169 slightly increased. When T was 7, CFRs decreased and reached stable at later stage. When T 170 was 6, plateau stage appeared earlier than T = 7. The slopes of linear models became flatter 171 and approached towards to 0 when T approaching to 6. Then T = 6 was selected as the true T 172 value for the true CFR calculation. The true CFR of COVID-19 in Hubei calculated by mean 173 value of the daily CFRs of plot 6 in Figure 4 was 5.4%. The estimated T value was smaller 174 than non-Hubei regions. It was not surprising as it seemed that time of case confirmation to 175 death was shorter. Previously in Wuhan City of Hubei Province, many patients had not been 176 .

Thus, to obtain an accurate CFR, timeliness of 179 case conformation should not vary too much. The possibility could not be rule out that the 180 CFR might slightly increase later like non-Hubei regions due to the long disease course of 181 COVID 19. 182 183 Figure 3 .

The curves came closest to coinciding in shape. For Hubei (Figure 5-Hubei) , 194 the predictive curve was similar in shape with true death line, however, from Jan 23 to Feb 10, 195 predicted death numbers were smaller than the true numbers. The predicted curve from Jan 23 196 to Feb 10 seemed be moved to right about 2 or 3 days. A subset data from Jan 21 to Feb 12 197 was selected to recalculate the T, and results in Hubei, T was 2 days. However, it could be go back on production. In summary, as death numbers had been almost accurately predicated 208 by calculated true CFR for more than 3 weeks, it could be considered as the true CFR of 209 COVID-19 in China except Hubei Province. For Hubei, calculated death number 210 corresponded with the reported number for more than 2 weeks. 211 .
