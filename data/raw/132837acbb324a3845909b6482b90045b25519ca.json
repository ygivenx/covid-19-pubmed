Our method uses the Kermack and Mckendrick model to simulate the way the outbreak grows and evolves when it arrives to the different cities and, also we use classical diffusion on a graph, to model the way the infection travels between cities by the airline routes. 9 The purpose of using a simple model for our analysis is to have the least number of parameters, but with sufficient precision to be able to give an estimate of the date of arrival of the outbreak for example, to Mexico City. By this date, it is well established that infection by this type of coronavirus is transmitted person to person through drops expelled by an infected person when coughing or sneezing, it is also possible to be transmitted by contact with surfaces or objects contaminated with the virus and then one puts his hands to his mouth, eyes or nose. 10 There is evidence that once the infectious outbreak has started there is some homogeneity in its .

For these reasons, the Kermack and McKendrick model is applicable in the cities that we use as nodes of the graph in which the edges represent the flights between one city and another. Brockmann and Helbling, 1 used a similar model to study the dispersion of a general infection except that their transfer term is not a symmetric diffusion.\n\nThe basic reproductive number was estimated using the data reported for Hubei and Guangdong, 11 an adjustment was made to the data at the beginning of the epidemic outbreak to estimate the force of infection \u03bb, which is related to the basic reproductive number as follows R 0 = 1 + \u03bb / \u03b2. The setting of \u03bb for Hubei and for Guangdong gives \u03bb = 0.3. These estimates give an R 0 = 2.5, which is in very good agreement with the estimate of Joseph T Wu 12 of R0 = 2.53 and, is well into the interval of the estimations reported for JM Read. 13 The diffusion coefficient D was estimated using numerical simulations of the model and the fact that a new outbreak started in Singapore around February 15, 2020. This gives a diffusion coefficient D = 10 -6 . In Figure 1 the nodes of the graph represent cities that were chosen because their airports function as important distribution points to other airports. In the model, some of these nodes also function as a representation of other airports in the region, for example, the Paris node represents the main international airports of that European region: Paris, Amsterdam and, Frankfurt. Using this graph and the estimated epidemiological parameters, the model was solved numerically to study in several scenarios the time of arrival of the infection to Mexico City.\n\n.

All our simulations have initial conditions in which only node 1 corresponding to the city of Wuhan has been infected and the other cities are not yet infected or represent a very small number with respect to its population. In the city of Wuhan, an infected number .

In both cases, the corresponding peaks at node 8 only gets slightly retarded.\n\nTo simulate the isolation measures imposed on Wuhan since the end of January, numerical simulations where performed with lowering the value of R 0 from 2.5 to 2.1 first and then to 1.9, This is shown in figure 2 by the black dashed curve for R 0 = 2.1 and by the black curve for R 0 = 1.9. As can be seen, this does not affect the high and width of the rest of the peaks and only delays the arrival of the rest of the nodes including node 8 of Mexico City by around of 4 days. This shows that changes not yet so small in R 0 do not substantially alter the result on the arrival of the outbreak at node 8. Simulations with R 0 = 3, when they era adjusted to match the outbreak in Wuhan also only anticipated the outbreak in Mexico City by 4 days. We performed other numerical simulations changing the R 0 in other nodes of the graph around 10% of its value, this changed the outbreaks at these nodes, but it did not change significantly, the date of arrival of the outbreak in Mexico City. Changes on the graph structure cutting some edges, meaning cancelling some airline routes, also did not modify significantly the date of arrival of the outbreak to the last node. Even cutting all the edges connecting to node 8 except one, only delayed the arrival of the outbreak to Mexico City around 6 days. Reducing the coefficient D has a larger impact on the delay of the outbreak, reducing D by one order of magnitude, from 10 -6 to 10 -7 , delayed the arrival of the outbreak to node 8 around 2 weeks.\n\nThe figure 2, also shows something else which is important, the time at which the first node reaches the maximum moves forward as the R0 decreases, this indicates that the isolation measures carried out in Wuhan only decreased a few tenths the R0, of the order of 5 tenths. This is because, according to the data presented by Johns Hopkins University, the report of cases begins to stabilize on approximately the in February 28, and therefore the maximum is expected to be reached close to this date. .

The coefficient that best controls the spread of infection in the rest of the cities, when this dispersion is by airlines, is the parameter D. Therefore, surveillance at airports should be strengthened, with special emphasis on those connecting Mexico directly or indirectly with Asian countries. Finally, this model shows that all these measures can only delay the arrival of SARS-CoV-2, but if it can be delayed long enough, it would be very important to have as much time as possible to establish the appropriate prevention and control measures. it will allow better management of the outbreak.\n\n.
