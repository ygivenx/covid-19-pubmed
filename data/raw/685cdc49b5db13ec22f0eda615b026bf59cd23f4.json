Note that these 178 differences cannot be attributed to genetic diversity, as dsDNA and dsRNA, which have 179 similar levels of selection, have however different levels of diversity ( Figure S3 ).

In spite of these differences, we note that episodic 227 diversifying selection mostly affects genes involved in viral replication (Table S1 ). Genes (Table S2) .

This suggests that despite key differences in life history strategies adopted Altogether, we showed that episodic diversifying selection is mostly found in single stranded 281 viruses, while correlated evolution is more prevalent in DNA viruses. More critically, we 282 also showed that the genes affected by each process, when acting independently, are in-283 volved in viral replication. However, the genes that are jointly affected by both processes 284 are mostly involved in viral stability (cell entry, integrity, assembly, immune escape), and 285 that the same amino acid sites tend to be affected by both processes.
