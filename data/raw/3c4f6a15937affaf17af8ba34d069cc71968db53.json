{"title": "Full Paper Design, Synthesis, and Antiviral Activity of Novel Ribonucleosides of 1,2,3-Triazolylbenzyl-aminophosphonates", "body": "Currently, most of the human beings in the world suffer from different kinds of diseases caused by DNA and RNA viruses. These diseases are mostly diagnosed but difficult to cure. Vaccination is a reliable tool to fight viral diseases, but it is only available against few viruses. The difficulties associated with national or worldwide vaccination programs make antiviral chemotherapy an even more practical approach in the fight against epidemic viral infections. Nucleoside analogs are synthetic compounds that are structurally similar to natural nucleosides and can serve as building blocks of DNA and RNA. They can act as competitive inhibitors of viral and cellular DNA and RNA polymerases or alternatively can be incorporated into growing DNA and RNA strands causing chain termination [1] .\n\na-Aminophosphonates are defined as structural analogs of natural amino acids. They are considered as an important class of compounds with diverse and interesting biological activities. Some of the aminophosphonates were described as anticancer agents [2] , enzyme inhibitors [3] , peptide mimetics [4] , antibiotics and pharmacological agents [5] . They have also Correspondence: Prof. Joachim W.

The a-aminophosphonate derivatives are often synthesized via the Kabachnik-Fields reaction by coupling of a carbonyl compound, an amine, and a hydroxyphosphoryl compound using various catalysts [7] [8] [9] .\n\n1,2,3-Triazoles were prepared by Huisgen in the 1960s [10] using the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction with acetylenes. After approximately four decades, this reaction has acquired considerable attention owing to the introduction of copper(I) as catalyst by Medal and then by Sharpless [11] [12] [13] . The copper-catalyzed cycloaddition of azides and alkynes (CuAAC) also known as \"click chemistry\" offers a simple access to the 1,4-isomer in very short reaction times.\n\nFurther, nucleosides containing 1,2,3-triazole ring have been of special interest in drug development research. Some synthetic triazoles have displayed interesting biological activities and several analogs have been tested against hepatitis C and HIV-1 viruses [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Moreover, nucleoside and acyclonucleoside analogs containing 1,2,3-triazole and phosphonate structures have been described as potent antiviral agents [19] [20] [21] .\n\nHerein, we describe the synthesis of novel hybrid molecules containing triazolyl-nucleoside linked to a-aminophosphonates by a phenyl ring. The choice of these structures is based on the combination of both pharmacophore parts, the phenyl-triazolyl-riboside and the a-aminophosphonates, which are known to have significant pharmacological properties. Our synthesis strategy is based on the use of two reactions: Kabachnick-Fields reaction and 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. The compounds obtained were tested against selected DNA and RNA viruses.\n\nThe synthesis of the desired compounds (4a-j and 5a-j) is depicted in Scheme 1. Initially, the a-aminophosphonate compounds were prepared in good yields via the Kabachnik-Fields reaction. The 4-[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]benzaldehyde 1 was reacted with diethylphosphite and corresponding amine in acetonitrile using molecular iodine as catalyst [22] [23] [24] . The latter is low-priced, readily available, non-metallic, and nontoxic. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h to get compounds 2a-j. The next step is deprotection of the trimethylsilyl group. For this purpose, tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in tetrahydrofurane (THF) was used to give the terminal alkyne [25] . The structures of 2e, 2f, 3d, and 3g were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1 ). According to the crystal data, the structures are similar for these compounds. The P-C bond has a staggered conformation, with the two six-membered groups with respect to the P --O double bond. The two benzene rings are almost perpendicular in all four compounds. In each crystal structure (2e, 3d, and 3g), the molecules are arranged as centrosymmetric or pseudocentrosymmetric dimers related by two N-H\u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1O --P hydrogen bonds. On the other hand, in the crystal structure of 2f, the hydrogen bond N-H\u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1O --P is not found, and the molecules are arranged as centrosymmetric dimers linked by C methyl -H\u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1O --P hydrogen bonds [26] .\n\nNext, the 1,2,3-triazolyl-nucleosides were prepared using the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction. For this, the terminal alkynes 3a-j and b-azido-ribose [27] were coupled using the Cu alkyne-azide cycloaddition in basic medium (triethylamine) and the reaction was carried out under microwave irradiation [28] . Microwave heating has been shown to increase reaction yields and to speed up reaction time [29] , b-azido-ribose is slightly unstable under micro-wave conditions and was used in excess. The configuration at the anomeric carbon C1 0 is retained as it is present in the b-azido-ribose. The hydroxyl functions were protected by benzoyl groups prior to the CuAAC reaction in order to increase the solubility of the compounds. The structures of all compounds were confirmed on the basis of 1 H, 13 C NMR spectra as well as by high-resolution mass spectrometry. In the 1 H NMR spectra of the intermediates, the triazole proton appears as a singlet in the aromatic region while the anomeric proton appears as a multiplet around 6 ppm.\n\nThe last step involves the removal of the benzoyl protecting groups from O2 0 , O3 0 , and O5 0 positions of D-ribose 4a-j using sodium methoxide (NaOMe) in methanol [30] to afford the desired 1,2,3-triazole nucleosides 5a-j (Table 1 ). \n\nThe antiviral activities of the synthesized compounds (4a-j, 5a-j) were tested against different viruses: HIV-1 and HIV-2 in MT4 cell cultures; herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) (Kos strain), herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) (G strain), HSV-1 thymidine kinase deficient, acyclovir-resistant (TK \u00c0 Kos, ACV r ), vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), adenovirus-2, varicella- a) All products were characterized by 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and mass spectrometry. b) Yields of isolated products for the CuAAC reaction. c) Yields of isolated products for the protection reaction.\n\ninfluenza A H1N1 subtype, influenza A H3N2 subtype, and influenza B virus in MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells.\n\nThe following reference compounds were included: tenofovir (PMPA), AMD3100, ganciclovir, cidofovir, acyclovir, brivudin, the lectins Hippeastrum hybrid agglutinin (HHA) and Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA), dextran sulfate (molecular weight 10000, DS-10000), ribavirin, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine and rimantadine, zalcitabine and alovudine.\n\nThe antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 : the compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity or viral plaque formation by 50%. The cytotoxicity of the tested compounds toward the uninfected host cells was defined as the minimum cytotoxic concentration (MCC) that causes a microscopically detectable alteration of normal cell morphology. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ), causing a 50% decrease in cell viability was determined using a colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay system. The tested compounds (4a-j, 5a-j) displayed no antiviral activity against the different viruses tested except for compounds 4b and 4c that showed a slight inhibition of respiratory syncytial virus replication ( Table 2 ) and compounds 5c, 5f, and 5g that displayed weak activity against both TK \u00fe and TK \u00c0 VZV strains (see Supporting Information). Although compound 4h had some activity against Coxsackie virus B4 in Vero cell cultures, no activity was seen in HeLa cells (Tables 2 and 3 ).\n\nA series of novel 1,2,3-triazolyl ribosides linked to a-aminophosphonates (4a-j, 5a-j) were successfully prepared in high yield via the Kabachnik-Fields reaction and a Cu(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition under microwave irradiation. The synthesized compounds were evaluated against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses, some of them showing modest activity against respiratory syncytial virus (compounds 4b and 4c) and varicella-zoster virus (compounds 5c, 5f, and 5g).\n\nReactions were carried out in a microwave oven model AVM510/WP/WH. Reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on precoated silica gel 60 F254 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany); UV light was used for visualization of the spots. All products were purified by column chromatography on silica gel (100-200 mesh; Merck). 1 C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 300 and 75 MHz spectrometer, respectively, SiMe 4 was used as internal standard. Chemical shifts are given in ppm and coupling constants (J) in MHz and multiplicity is reported as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), and m (multiplet). Mass spectra were produced by ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF-MS.\n\nGeneral procedure for the synthesis of diethyl [(4-(2-(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)phenyl)(aryl or alkylamino)methyl]phosphonates 2a-j\n\nThe compounds 2a-j were synthesized by reaction of commercial (Sigma-Aldrich) 4-[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]benzaldehyde 1 (1 mmol), diethylphosphite (1.2 equiv.), and corresponding amine (1.2 equiv.) in acetonitrile (3 mL) using molecular iodine (0.2 equiv.) as catalyst at room temperature, the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h.
