{"title": "Transcriptomic Signatures of Tacaribe Virus-Infected Jamaican Fruit Bats", "body": "Bats are a phylogenetically and geographically diverse group of mammals, with about 1,150 species (1, 2). Certain bat species have been identified as reservoir hosts of zoonotic viruses associated with significant human morbidity and mortality, including rabies virus and other lyssaviruses, Marburg virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus (3). They also are suspected reservoirs of other viruses, such as the ebolaviruses, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses (CoVs) (4\u20136). Each of these viruses can cause severe disease in humans but are not known to cause disease in their reservoir hosts (3, 7). Although nearly 200 viruses have been associated with bats, there are likely many more (8). As non-model organisms, virtually nothing is known about bat immune responses. Although bats appear to have small genomes relative to other mammals (9), genomic analyses suggest that bats share most features of other mammals (8, 10\u201312).\n\nDespite serving as reservoir hosts of several zoonotic viruses, some bats are also susceptible to infectious diseases. White nose syndrome, which has caused the deaths of millions of bats in North America, is a fungal disease threatening some species with extinction (13\u201316). Bats can shed rabies virus and other lyssaviruses for prolonged periods, but the infection is always fatal (3, 17\u201321). Because bats are important members of their ecosystems, a better understanding of the immune responses and subsequent pathogenesis to infectious agents is essential. To this end, we developed a laboratory model for the study of infection of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) by a natural bat pathogen, Tacaribe virus (TCRV) (11, 21, 22).\n\nTCRV is a mammarenavirus first isolated from two species of diseased artibeus bats in the late 1950s near Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, and is most closely related to Jun\u00efn and Machupo viruses, which cause Argentine and Bolivian hemorrhagic fevers, respectively (23\u201325). Each arenavirus is associated with a specific host species, and the distribution of the host therefore dictates the distribution of the virus. All known reservoir hosts of mammarenaviruses are rodents; however, the reservoir host of TCRV remains unclear. It was suspected that artibeus bats were reservoirs of TCRV given its original isolation from multiple artibeus bats and the inability to detect it in other mammals (25\u201327). Interestingly, TCRV was isolated from lone star ticks collected in Florida in 2012 (28). The tick-derived isolate was nearly identical to the TCRV isolate from Trinidad (TRVL-11573), with 99.6% nucleotide identity across its genome (28). Recent studies by our group found that TCRV causes fatal disease or is cleared without pathology in Jamaican fruit bats, features that are inconsistent for a reservoir host (22). In many of these bats, substantial neutrophil and lymphocytic infiltration into tissues occurred, which suggests a role for these cells in the host response to TCRV (22).\n\nThe present study was designed to characterize the transcriptional responses of bats with TCRV disease. Accordingly, we performed RNA sequencing of spleens and liver and kidney samples from experimentally infected bats and generated a broad bat transcriptome rich in annotated genes. These target tissues were chosen because they represent the organs with the most significant pathology in our previous report (8). This report is the most comprehensive gene discovery work in the species to date and the first to describe immune gene expression responses in bats during an arenavirus infection.\n\nWe previously reported a high mortality rate in Jamaican fruit bats experimentally infected with TCRV, in which high-dose inoculations (106 50% tissue culture infective doses [TCID50]) caused significant and fatal disease as early as 10 days postinfection (22). Histopathologic findings revealed multiple organ involvement in TCRV disease, including acute neutrophilic splenitis and white pulp hyperplasia, as well as plasmacytic and histiocytic splenitis. To profile the host pathogenic transcriptional response, we generated stranded poly(A)+ Illumina RNA-Seq (transcriptome sequencing) libraries using RNA extracted from the organs of experimentally infected bats. For this analysis, we harvested the livers, kidneys, and spleens from 2 control bats (Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate-buffered saline [DPBS] treated) and 2 TCRV-infected bats with fatal disease (Fig. 1). Our previous analysis indicated TCRV RNA was present in each of these tissues at time of collection (22). A total of 12 pooled samples were sequenced, generating 693,106,150 raw 100-bp paired-end reads. After demultiplexing, trimming of poor-quality reads and adapter sequences, and removing duplicate reads, 691,108,820 nonredundant reads per sample were used for the transcriptome assembly. De novo assembly of the global transcriptome was performed using Trinity, resulting in 349,855 assembled transcripts of \u2265300 bp (mean length of 997 bp) with an N50 of 3,419 bases that were clustered into 175,144 nonredundant clustered transcripts (unigenes) (Fig. 2A) (29). Inspection of these unigenes identified from the combined transcriptome showed that 35% of the contigs (12,600) are expressed in each of the three different tissues (fragments per kilobase per million [FPKM], >1), whereas the expression of many tissue-specific contigs was identified in the spleen, liver, and kidney (Fig. 2B).\n\nThe combined Jamaican fruit bat transcriptome was systematically annotated using the Trinotate pipeline, a software suite that automates the functional annotation of the assembled contigs (30). The annotation report for the combined assembly from the Trinotate pipeline (see Data Set S1 in the supplemental material) represents the predicted coding sequences of Jamaican fruit bat genes and the results of homology searches against the databases listed in Data Set S1. Among the 227,656 transcripts containing complete open reading frame (ORF) sequences, 124,204 nonredundant ORFs (54%) were associated with high-confidence coding predictions, BLAST homology and PFAM domain content (see Data Set S2 in the supplemental material). We compared this combined Jamaican fruit bat transcriptome assembly to those of other mammals through BLASTX analysis. The bat Brandt\u2019s myotis (Myotis brandtii) had the highest number of related sequences (8,060 similar sequences [Data Set S2]). Among other mammals were the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) and the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) (with 7,947 and 6,955 similar sequences, respectively) (Fig. 2C).\n\nTo investigate the molecular response of bats to TCRV infection, differential gene expression analysis was performed. We used a pairwise comparison of TCRV-infected samples against the corresponding controls and found that the expression levels of hundreds of different genes were altered during TCRV infection (Fig. 3A). The spleen had the largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs); among these 1,912 DEGs, 1,187 were upregulated and 725 were downregulated following infection (Fig. 3C; false discovery rate [FDR], <0.01; log2 fold change, >2). We also determined that the kidney and liver each had a greater number of upregulated genes (251 and 188, respectively) compared to the number of downregulated genes in these tissues following TCRV infection (123 and 72, respectively). A comparison of all TCRV-infected tissues against all of the uninfected controls revealed 62 upregulated and 16 downregulated genes (Fig. 3B and C).\n\nTo gain specific insight into the immune-related gene expression altered in response to TCRV infection, we utilized the ImmPort database to identify those TCRV-altered genes that relate to immune-system functions (31). Approximately 23% of the 4,723 genes available in the database corresponded to the differentially expressed genes annotated in our analysis (see Data Set S3 in the supplemental material). The coordinating transcript expression values of these identified immune genes were used to evaluate the relationship between the specific uninfected and infected tissues (Fig. 4A). While all three tissue types studied had unique expression profiles in the infected samples, we further analyzed the transcripts contained in cluster 3, which represent sequences with overall shared expression patterns and found that these corresponding genes map to pathways identified to be affected in response to viral infection (Fig. 4B). Notably, with the use of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA [Qiagen]), we identified the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway to be among the top pathways altered upon TCRV infection (cluster 3, IPA [see Data S4 in the supplemental material]). IFNs are a family of cytokines secreted by host cells in response to viruses and other pathogens to confer antiviral states upon uninfected neighboring cells in an effort to prevent spread of infection (32). Given that the IFN response has been explored in bats in regard to pathogen-host response (33), we then further examined the relationship between these factors within the spleen, kidney, and liver in response to TCRV infection and found that while most of the identified IFN pathway-related genes were upregulated, all of the factors identified in this pathway had statistically significant differential expression (log2 fold change, >2; FDR, <0.01) in the spleen (Fig. 4C; see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). We validated differential expression of select immune genes via reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and confirmed upregulation of ISG15 and IRF7 in the spleen and kidney tissues and downregulation of HLA-DRA in the kidney (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material).\n\nIn addition to the IFN-signaling pathway, we identified signaling pathways for Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (among other cytokines), as well as pathways for T-helper cell differentiation and the Th1 pathway (Fig. 4B; see Fig. S3 and Data Set S4 in the supplemental material). Further analysis of all DEGs via the Reactome plugin (Cytoscape) identified additional key pathways involved in the immune response (Table 1; Data Set S4, \u201cAll up-regulated Reactome\u201d). Specifically, we identified increased transcript levels of several cytokine genes (IL6, IL8, IL1A, IL1B, and IFNG) and chemokine genes (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, and CXCL6). To highlight markers associated with circulating immune cells, we focused on those DEGs that were common to two or more tissues, and the data are consistent with increased infiltration of neutrophils into the infected tissues. In kidneys, neutrophil infiltration can cause hyperinflammation and kidney damage (34). This is further supported by the presence of enriched expression levels of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGALl) in all three tissues, which is a biomarker for renal damage in humans (35).\n\nTranscripts for IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE were identified in the spleen data, and the level of each was significantly elevated in the infected bats. Six transcripts of IgG heavy chains were identified, including 5 with complete and distinct V regions. The six IgG constant regions were identical, other than one that contained a Thr in place of an Ala, which could represent an allele or a sequencing error. The hinge regions, which are frequently different between IgG subclasses within a species, were identical in all 6 transcripts. These two features suggest that Jamaican fruit bats have a single IgG isotype. The 5 V regions contain the canonical mammalian Ig sequences, including 4 framework regions (FR) and 3 complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) (Fig. 5). Three distinct CDR3 sequences were present in these 5 transcripts. Two had 2 tyrosine residues, whereas the three that were identical had 6, substantially more than what has been reported in the CDR3s of other bat species (36, 37). Sequences for T-cell receptor alpha (TCR-\u03b1), TCR-\u03b2, TCR-\u03b3, and TCR-\u03b4 constant region domains were present in the assembly, although none had complete V regions (data not shown). Expression of TCR-\u03b1 was identified in all uninfected and infected tissues, TCR-\u03b2 in all spleen and liver tissues, TCR-\u03b3 in all spleen and liver tissues, and TCR-\u03b4 in all spleen and uninfected liver tissues.\n\nTo characterize the overall transcriptome in response to TCRV infection, we performed an unbiased evaluation of the top 10 Reactome pathways (ranked by P value) associated with DEGs in various organs (Table 2; Fig. S2 and Data Set S4, \u201cTop Pathways Reactome\u201d). In all three tissues, genes controlling cell cycle progression were elevated, including many associated with hypoxia, cell stress, senescence, and chromatin organization.\n\nSpleen differential expression analysis indicated that immune system pathways were significantly elevated, including type I and II IFN signaling, antiviral IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), interleukin signaling, and T and B cell activation pathways. Interestingly, genes involved in the complement cascade were repressed, including the genes for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and complement receptor 1. SH2B1, a gene encoding an important signal transduction adaptor in several pathways, including JAK, prolactin, platelet-derived growth factor, and nerve growth factor signaling, was also significantly downregulated in the spleen (38). We also identified repression of proapoptotic genes BMP and PMAIP1 as well as repression of genes involved in calcium mobilization following TCRV infection (39).\n\nIn the liver, Reactome analysis revealed strong immune activation signatures, including T-cell receptor and CD28 costimulatory signaling. No evidence of B-cell or NK cell activities was present. TLR and RIG-I/MDA5 signaling for type I IFN responses was also elevated, despite no evidence of differentially expressed type I IFN genes. Unlike the spleen, complement pathways were also enriched. The IFN-\u03b3 signaling pathway was also identified, although IFNG itself was not differentially expressed. Despite these findings, further indications of apoptotic activation were not differentially expressed in the livers. As in the spleen, many metabolic genes were elevated, whereas genes involved in calcium mobilization were repressed.\n\nIn the kidneys, Reactome analysis suggested that platelet calcium-associated degranulation may occur; the genes F13A1 and TMSB4X were elevated along with other genes involved in calcium mobilization. As in the other tissues, evidence of innate antiviral responses was present, including TLR signaling, RIG-I/MDA5 activity, and type I IFN signaling genes. Interleukin and IFN-\u03b3 signaling were also among the pathways characterized secondary to gene upregulation in the kidneys.\n\nThis study provides a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional landscape of Jamaican fruit bats during infection with Tacaribe virus. This natural pathogen of artibeus bats causes high-mortality disease with similar clinical manifestations to the South American hemorrhagic fevers and Lassa fever. In summary, this analysis identified the global response to TCRV infection. Our results suggest diverse immune responses, including alterations in neutrophil activation, interferon signaling, markers for lymphocytes, and antibodies. We found substantial signatures of neutrophil activation in the spleen, kidney, and liver of bats with fatal disease. The innate and adaptive immune response appeared to be functional and typical of the canonical antiviral response. Many activation markers of T and B lymphocytes were also found; however, few indications of NK cell activity or T-cell exhaustion were apparent. IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE sequences were abundantly expressed in the spleens of infected bats, and five immunoglobulin heavy-chain V segments were identified. Despite the clear evidence of antibody synthesis during infection, AID expression was not elevated, suggesting somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation were absent or minimal. Analysis of immunoglobulin heavy-chain and TCR V regions suggests that Jamaican fruit bats have canonical immunoglobulin and TCR genes found in most mammals. Moreover, the species appears to have a single IgG subclass. These results are the most extensive gene discovery work completed in Jamaican fruit bats to date and the first to describe differential immune gene expression in bats during a pathogenic virus infection.\n\nExperimental infections of Jamaican fruit bats were previously reported (22). Briefly, two Jamaican fruit bats were inoculated with 100 \u03bcl of sterile Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) as negative controls (bat IDs 688 and 689), and two bats were inoculated with 100 \u03bcl containing 106 TCID50 TCRV (bat IDs 714 and 729). Negative control bats were euthanized at the end of the experimental period (45 days), whereas TCRV-infected bats were euthanized as they became moribund (days 11 and 18, respectively). Necropsies were performed directly following euthanasia, and organs were harvested and collected in RNAlater stabilization reagent (Qiagen). RNA was extracted from flash-frozen tissues by homogenization with a Mini Bead Beater (BioSpec Products, Inc.), using QiaShredder columns with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen).\n\nStranded Illumina libraries for each tissue were prepared from total RNA using the NEB Ultra Directional RNA library prep kit with poly(A) selection. Sequencing (paired-end 100 bp) was performed on the Illumina HiSeq-2000 platform at the UC Denver Genomics core.\n\nFor transcriptome assembly, raw reads were filtered for adapter sequences and low-quality reads, and assembly was performed using Trinity (30) with the following parameters: \u2014min_contig_length 300\u2014min_glue 3\u2014min_kmer_cov 2. Resulting contigs were processed for read alignment and abundance estimation with Bowtie and RSEM (75, 76). Differential expression was performed using the edgeR package within the Trinity differential analysis pipeline using default parameters (77). A pairwise comparison was made between TCRV-infected samples and control uninfected samples. Genes were considered differentially expressed with an FDR of <0.01 and a log2 fold change of >2. The complete list of annotated differentially regulated genes in each organ can be found in Data Set S3.\n\nBLAST alignments and functional annotations were performed using Blast2GO Pro or Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (78, 79). Specific parameters can be found in Data Set S5 in the supplemental material, and the resulting outputs are summarized in Data S4. Direct pathway analysis for immune-related genes was performed using the gene list from the ImmPort database (31).\n\nContigs for immunoglobulins were translated using the default translation table of MacVector software. MUSCLE alignments were made to identify leader, framework regions, and complementarity-determining regions of the V segments using a black flying fox sequence as a reference (NCBI GenBank accession no. ADD71702.1) (50). Heavy chains and hinge regions were identified by BLAST against other Chiroptera.\n\nThe experimental primer sequences used in RT-qPCR analysis are listed in Fig. S2. cDNA was generated using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo Scientific) and SYBR Select master mix for CFX (Applied Biosystems). The same two Jamaican fruit bats that were used for uninfected samples in RNA-Seq were also used as uninfected samples for RT-qPCR.\n\nRaw reads have been deposited into GenBank under GenBank accession no.
