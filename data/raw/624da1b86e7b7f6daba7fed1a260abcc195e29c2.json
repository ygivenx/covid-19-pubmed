{"title": "Archives of Virology Astrovirus-Like, Coronavirus-Like, and Parvovirus-Like Partieles Detected in the Diarrheal Stools of Beagle Pups", "body": "A number of virus-like particles detected in fecal material by electron microscopy (EM) have been found to manifest sufficiently distinct morphology to warrant individual classification. Such readily identified agents include: rotavirus (11) , coronavirus (30) , adenovirus (12) , ealieivirus (20) , and possibly-minireo/rotavirus (23, 29) .\n\nAstrovirus, another characteristic agent identified by EIM, was originally associated with infantile gastroenteritis (18, 19) . Subsequent investigations confirmed the identification of this agent in stools of newborns with acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis (16) , and in outbreaks of gastroenteritis involving children and adults (2, 15) . Virus-like particles, 28--30 nm in diameter, possessing the distinctive star-like surface morphology have also been detected in the diarrheal feces of lambs (27) and calves (32) .\n\nThis paper reports the detection of astrovirus-like particles in loose and diarrheal stools encountered in a litter of seven beagle pups obtained for laboratory research p u r p o s e s . O t h e r p a r t i c l e -t y p e s p r e v i o u s l y a s s o c i a t e d w i t h c a n i n e v i r a l e n t e r i t i s , c o r o n a v i r u s (5) a n d p a r v o v i r u s (6, 10), were also d e t e c t e d .\n\nA litter of seven ll~2-week-old pups, cesarean section delivered a n d k e p t in a germ-free e n v i r o n m e n t , was acquired after detection of b a c t e r i a in t h e isolation unit. U p o n arrival t h e pups appeared in good condition, however, w i t h i n 3 to 4 days loose stools were noted. Two pups a p p e a r e d severely ill 7 a n d 10 days after arrival a n d were sacrificed for necropsy b y associated medical (laboratory animal) personnel. Symptoms included diarrhea (with some blood noted), excessive salivation, a n d convulsions.\n\nA stool specimen for EM e x a m i n a t i o n was collected from each of t h e r e m a i n i n g five pups two weeks after arrival. All of t h e stools were either loose or diarrheal a n d included a specimen from a t h i r d severely-affected p u p (a saliva specimen was also o b t a i n e d from this pup). Twelve days later, all pups a p p e a r e d in good condition a n d were excreting formed stools. A t t h a t time, a second stool specimen was collected from four of t h e pups (one mildly-affected p u p h a d been used in a n u n r e l a t e d e x p e r i m e n t a n d was n o t available).\n\nF i v e weeks after arrival, blood specimens (5 10 ml) were d r a w n from all five p u p s ; a n d t h e individual sera were o b t a i n e d after being centrifuged free of cellular a n d clotted m a t e r i a l at 800 \u00d7 g for 30 minutes.\n\nA 20 percent suspension (30 ml) of each stool specimen was m a d e in distilled water. Large p a r t i c u l a t e m a t e r i a l was r e m o v e d b y initial e e n t r i f u g a t i o n a t i 70 \u00d7 g for 15 minutes. T h e s u p e r n a t a n t was f u r t h e r centrifuged a t 3500 \u00d7 g for 30 minutes, r e m o v i n g additional material. T h e s u p e r n a t a n t was finMly centrifuged a t 110,000 \u00d7 g for 2 hours using a B e c k m a n 60 Ti rotor. T h e resulting high-speed pellet was resuspended w i t h a smMt v o l u m e of w a t e r a n d e x a m i n e d with t h e eleetron microscope.\n\nA drop of sample to be e x a m i n e d was placed on a copper E M grid (carbon substrate), allowed to s t a n d one m i n u t e , a n d t h e excess r e m o v e d w i t h a piece of filter paper. The grid was rinsed w i t h 1 or 2 drops of distilled w a t e r followed b y negative staining w i t h 2 p e r c e n t p h o s p h o t u n g s t i c acid, p H 7. After t h e excess s t a i n was r e m o v e d a n d t h e grid dried, t h e p r e p a r a t i o n was e x a m i n e d a t 8 0 K v on a J E O L 100CX electron microscope.\n\nAfter E M e x a m i n a t i o n , portions of each loose or diarrheal stool p r e p a r a t i o n were c o m b i n e d (excluding one p r e p a r a t i o n found Go c o n t a i n parvovirus-like particles a n d separately centrifuged) a n d suspended in a solution of CsC1 (in PBS, p H 7.3) with a refractive index of 1.370. The suspension was placed in a centrifuge t u b e a n d centrifuged at 110,000 \u00d7 g for 24 hours ( B e c k m a n S W d l T i rotor). F r a c t i o n s of 0.5 ml were collected from t h e b o t t o m of t h e tube. T h e refractive index a n d t h e a b s o r b a n c e at 260 n m of each fraction was measured. The d e n s i t y of each fraction was calculated using the formula: d ~ 10.8601 nD ~5 -13.4974. P e a k U V -a b s o r b i n g fractions were e x a m i n e d b y EM. All fractions were tested for h e m a g g l u t i n a t i n g capacity using rhesus RBC's.\n\nT h e parvovirus-tike particle p r e p a r a t i o n was similarly centrifuged, fractionat.ed, a n d examined. Centrifuge t i m e was e x t e n d e d to 48 hours to optimize t h e d e v e l o p m e n t of t h e b a n d i n g p a t t e r n .\n\nMaterial r e m a i n i n g a t t h e t o p of b o t h gradients was found to c o n t a i n \" t y p i c a l \" coronavirus-like particles. These top c o m p o n e n t s were combined, suspended in a CsC1/ P B S solution w i t h a refractive index of 1.355, a n d centrifuged for 48 hours. F r a c t i o n s were collected a n d processed as previously described.\n\nTwo syringe drops (approximately 0.025 ml) of unaggregated suspensions of each particle-type were incubated (4\u00b0C overnight) with 1\"10 dilutions (0.1 ml volumes in PBS) of convalescent sera obtained from each of the pups. The incubated suspensions were then examined by EM for the appearance of aggregated particles. Serum incubations involving the \"typical\" eoronavirus-like particle were examined after one hour as increased antibody attachment to the particles obscured their characteristic fringe projections.\n\nCesium chloride banded particle suspensions as well as high-speed pellet resuspensions were inoculated onto cultures of primary canine kidney, primary human embryo kidney, and Madin Darby canine kidney cells. Inoculated cultures were examined daily for eytopathic effect (CPE) . Supernatants of all cultures exhibiting possible CPE were examined by EM for the presence of virus-like particles.\n\nExamination of the loose and diarrheal stool preparations revealed a roughly spherical virus-like particle being shed by each of the pups. A definite star shape was observed on the surface of a portion of these particles (Fig. 1 a) . The diameter of the particles was slightly larger than that of cell culture propagated poliovirus when observed at the same magnification settings. The mean diameter of 100 partitles (:[:SD) was 28.4-~1.0 nm. Indistinct stracture3 could be observed at times surrounding the particles. The observed particle characteristics correlated with those initially described for the astrovirus particle (18, 19) and as no hollow centers were observed within the star shapes, the particles could not be confused with calicivirus (21).\n\nA smaller particle-type was found to predominate in the stool obtained from the more severely-affected pup (Fig. 1 b) . No surface detail could be observed, however, certain stain penetrated-particles revealed a definite hexagonal shape (Fig. lb, insert) . The mean diameter of 100 particles was 22.7::~::0.5 rim. As the relatively small size was well within the range reported for the parvovirus group (3) and such hexagonal shapes reported for the canine parvovirus-like agents MVC (4) and CHEV (6), a similar parvovirus-like classification was suggested for this particle. Direct EM examination of the saliva specimen from this pup revealed the presence of the particle in antibody-like aggregates (Fig. 2a) .\n\nTwo distinct types of particles resembling coronaviruses were also detected in the stool specimens. \"Typical\" coronavirus-like particles (Fig. 2 b, upper particle) had characteristic bulbous projections (17, 31) approximately 18 nm in length. The particles were detected in each of the stool specimens, although in no instance were they the predominant particle found. \"Alternate\" eoronavirus-like particles (Fig. 2b , lower particle and 2e) had very thin to nndetectable stalk-like projections which eulminate:l in distal knobs or other indistinct shapes (total length, 21--29 rim). Only two stool specimens were found to contain these particles. This \"alternate\" type resembled particles detected in human stools in India (22) and has since been reported more characteristic of coronaviruses dete~tcfl i~a human stools (7, 8) . Both eoronavirus-like particle-types were pleomorphie with average diameters (excludhag projections) generally ranging from 50--125 nm. Particles in excess of .550 n m in a single dimension were oeeaMonatly seen.\n\nThe partiele-types detected in the acute phase stools from each of the pups is presented in Table 1 . No specimens were obtained from the s~crifieed dogs. Only the \"alternate\" eoronavirus-like particles (from pups Nos. 3 and 4) remained readily detected in preparations of formed stools. Prolonged excretion of coronavirus has been noted (8) although the significance of such shedding remains unclear. \n\nCesium chloride equilibrium centrifugation of the combined stool preparations (excluding the parvovirus-like particle preparation) yielded two distinct bands of 260 nm absorbing material (Fig. 3a) with measured peaks at densities of 1 At and 1.34 g/mI. Examination by EM revealed \"alternate\" corona, virus-like particles at i.41 g/mI and astrovirus-like particles at 1.34 g/ml.\n\nCentrifugation of the parvovirus-like particle preparation resulted in three distinct UV-absorbing bands (Fig. 3b) with measured peaks at 1.39, 1.34, and 1.30 g/ml. Exclusively \"full\" (stMn unpenetrated) parvovirus-like particles were found by EM at 1.39 g/ml. Astrovirus-like particles were again found at i.34 g/ml and \" e m p t y \" (stain penetrated) parvovirus-like particles were found at 1.30 g/ml. Fractions at the bottom of the tube were observed to contain debris.\n\nVisible material remMning at the top of the gradients was found to contain \"typical\" coronavirus-like particles among various membranous elements. Subsequent eentrifugation of this material in a less dense CsC1 solution did not result in a speetrophotometrieally detected band. Examination by EM did detect peak numbers of these particles at densities of 1.24--1.26 g/ml.\n\nEach of the CsCl-banded particle-types is shown in Fig. 4 (a--e) .

Insert shows the hexagonal shape of a stain penetrated particle (Bar --50 nm for both inserts)\n\nConvalescent sera obtained h'om each of the pups aggregated astrovirus-like, parvovirus-like, and \"typical\" coronavirus-like particles ( Table 2) . The aggregates are shown in Fig. 5 (a--c) . \" A l t e r n a t e \" coronavirus-like particles (Fig. 5d) were not aggregated b y a n y of the sera. \n\nParticle associated CPE was not detected in a n y of the cell cultures. P r e m a t u r e deterioration of the cell monolayer (compared to control cultures) was noted in two inoculated p r i m a r y canine k i d n e y cultures, however, EM e x a m i n a t i o n revealed no virus-like particles in the supernatants.

The EM identification was supported by particle banding patterns established through equilibrium eentrifugation in CsC1.\n\nThe density associated with the astrovirus-like particle, 1.34 g/ml, agrees with a previously reported value of 1.33--1.34 g/ml for astrovirns detected in the stools of newborns with gastroenteritis (t6).\n\nBuoyant densities of \"full\" (1.39 g/ml) and \" e m p t y \" (1.30 g/ml) parvoviruslike particles are in accordance with corresponding \"mature virion\" (1.39 to 1.42 g/ml) and \" e m p t y particle\" (1.31 g/ml) densities reported for the parvovirus group (3). A similar density of 1.4 was obtained for the cytopathogenic agent of the minute virus of canines (3/[VC) (26) , while the reported densities associated with canine hemorrhagic enteritis virus (CHEV) were 1.43 g/ml (\"full\"), 1.38 g/mI (\"full\" and \"empty\") and 1.34 g/ml (\"empty\") (6) . Both these canine parvoviruslike agents agglutinated rhesus RBC's, as did the agent of this study.\n\nThe density associated with the \"typical\" eoronavirus-like particle, 1.24 to 1.26 g/ml, conforms to a recently reported value of 1.245 g/ml for a bovine coronavirus (13) , while the value of 1.41 g/ml associated with the \"alternate\" coronaviruslike particle may be indicative of a basically altered form. Treatment of HEV, a porcine coronavirus possessing typical bulbous projections, with dithiothreitol (DTT) has been shown to remove surface glyeoproteins and to result in the appearance of thin, fibrous projections. This treatment also reduced infectivity (24) . Such structural alteration resulting in the \"alternate\" eoronavirus-like agent detected here m a y explain the failure of convalescent sera to react with it. Convalescent sera aggregation of the other particle types indicated general exposure of the pups to each of these agents.\n\nThe enteric pathogenesis of eoronaviruses and parvovirus-like agents in dogs (9, t4), and astroviruses in lambs (28) has been described. Each must be considered a possible etiologic agent of the diarrheal illness repor~d here. Three of the pups, however, appeared more severely affected than the others. The parvovirus-like particles were detected in the specimens obtained from one of these three pups. No specimens were available from the other two, as they had been sacrificed (necropsy reports obtained on the two pups noted bowel irritation). The association of the parvovirus-Iike particles with the severely-affected pup is consistent with the recently reported severe nature of outbreaks of parvovirus associated diarrheal disease (1). Detection of these particles in the saliva specimen supports the suspected existence of an alternative route of transmission not mediated by fecal exposure (25) . Fig. 4 . Particle-types detected at different densities following CsC1 equilibrium eentrifugation (]Bar = 100 rim). a Astrovirus-like particles (1.34 g/ml), b \"Full\" parvovirus-like particles (1.39g/ml). c \"Empty\" parvovirusdike particles (1.30g/ml). d \"TypieM\" eoronavirus-like particles (1.24--1.26 g/ml), e \"Alternate\" eoronaviruslike particles (1.41 g/ml) (Bar = 100 rim) Although its role as an etiologic agent of the diarrheal illness encountered in this group of pups remains unclear, the detection of the astrovirus-like particles in the acute phase fecal specimens increases the n u m b e r of species in which this agent has been found and associated with gastroenteritis.\n\nThe source of the illness has not been determined. Other dogs had recently been k e p t at the facility before the p u p ' s arrival. Although no s y m p t o m s of illness were noted in the older dogs, a s y m p t o m a t i c shedding of each of these particletypes has been r e p o r t e d (4, 19, 22) . The previous isolation of the pups would maximize their susceptibility to such agents remaining in the environment.\n\nFailure thus far to p r o p a g a t e any of these agents in cell culture has limited further investigation."}
