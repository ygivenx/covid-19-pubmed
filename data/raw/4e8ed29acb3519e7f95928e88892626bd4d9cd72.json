{"title": "Genetic diversity of porcine sapoviruses", "body": "Caliciviruses are small, non-enveloped viruses 27-38 nm in diameter and possess a single-stranded, 7.3-8.3 kb plus-sense RNA genome and a single 56-71 kDa capsid protein (Green et al., 2000) . The family www.elsevier.com/locate/vetmic Veterinary Microbiology 122 (2007) [246] [247] [248] [249] [250] [251] [252] [253] [254] [255] [256] [257] Caliciviridae is divided into at least four genera: Vesivirus, Lagovirus, Norovirus (NoV), and Sapovirus (SaV) with a new proposed genus, NB-like (Smiley et al., 2002) , based on genomic organization and genetic analysis (Green et al., 2000) . Caliciviruses are associated with a wide range of economically important diseases in animals, including humans (Geissler et al., 1997; Green et al., 2001; Ohlinger et al., 1990) .\n\nNoroviruses and sapoviruses have emerged as the leading cause of food-and waterborne, acute, nonbacterial gastroenteritis in humans worldwide (Green et al., 2001) . Animal SaVs and NoVs also cause gastroenteritis in swine, calves and mink (Bridger, 1990; Guo et al., 2001a,b; Saif et al., 1980) . Several of porcine SaVs and NoVs are closely related to human SaVs and NoVs genetically, which has raised public health concerns of potential cross-species transmission and animal reservoirs for SaVs and NoVs related to human SaVs and NoVs (Guo et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2005a,b) . However, the occurrence of porcine enteric caliciviruses has been reported in only a few countries including the US (both SaVs and NoVs), Japan (only NoVs), Venezuela (both SaVs and NoVs), Netherlands (both SaVs and NoVs), and the United Kingdom (Bridger, 1990; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2006; Sugieda et al., 1998; van Der Poel et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2005a,b) .\n\nHuman enteric caliciviruses cannot be cultured in vitro. Therefore, molecular studies have relied on the availability of stool samples collected during outbreaks or from human volunteer studies. Molecular analysis of human SaVs has demonstrated significant genetic diversity among the viruses within this genus: these have been genetically divided into four genogroups (GI, \u00c0II, \u00c0IV, and \u00c0V) and at least eight genetic clusters or genotypes (GI/1 to 3, GII/1 to \u00c03, GIV/1, and GV/1) (Farkas et al., 2004; Schuffenecker et al., 2001) . Porcine SaVs circulating in the US have been genetically analyzed using the major strains classified as SaV/GIII (Guo et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2005a) , though one strain represents a potential new genogroup of porcine SaVs (Wang et al., 2005a) . Since the discovery of porcine SaVs in the 1980s (Saif et al., 1980) , only a few additional studies of their genetic diversity have been reported (Farkas et al., 2004; Guo et al., 1999; Schuffenecker et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2005a) . In South Korea, we demonstrated that porcine SaVs cause diarrhea outbreaks . However, little is known about the genetic diversity of the porcine SaVs circulating in South Korea. Therefore, the aim of this study was to obtain information on the genetic heterogeneity of porcine SaVs circulating in South Korea.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2005, a total of 237 fecal specimens from diarrheic pigs obtained from 78 herds were collected from six provinces in South Korea during the spring (105 samples/33 farms), summer (35 samples/ 14 farms), autumn (65 samples/16 farms) and winter (32 samples/15 farms). The ages of the pigs tested from all provinces ranged from 3 to 70 days. The fecal samples were examined for common bacterial enteric pathogens including Salmonella spp. using specific agar media. Brachyspira hyodysenteriae detection was performed by PCR using the specific primers (La et al., 2003) . For the extraction of viral RNA, fecal suspensions of each sample were prepared immediately by diluting the feces 1:10 in 0.01 M phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2. The suspensions were then vortexed for 30 sec, centrifuged (1200 \u00c2 g for 20 min), and the supernatants were collected and stored at \u00c080 8C for further testing.\n\nThe RNA was extracted from a 200 ml starting volume of centrifuged 10% fecal suspensions using the Trizol-LS (Gibco-BRL, Life Tech, Grand Island, NY) procedure. The total RNA recovered was suspended in 50 ml of RNase free water and stored at \u00c080 8C until used.\n\nRT-PCR assays with different primer sets (Table 1) for the detection of group A, B and C porcine rotaviruses (PRV A-C), porcine SaV, porcine NoV, transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV) were performed using a standard one-step RT-PCR as previously described (Cho et al., 2001; Park et al., 2006) . In order to increase the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR, nested PCR assays with the primer pairs specific to each capsid and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of porcine SaV, PRV A and PRV C (Table 1 ) were performed as previously described (Cho et al., 2001; Park et al., 2006) . The amplification products were analyzed by 1.5 or 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by UV after ethidium bromide staining.\n\nThe RT-PCR products for a portion of the porcine SaV capsid gene (757 bp), and the nested PCR products amplified by the PECnF and PECnR primers for a portion of the RdRp gene (380 bp) ( Table 1) were selected from different test reactions and sequenced to verify reaction the specificity and to obtain genomic data for phylogenetic analysis. The RT-PCR products were purified using a GenClean II kit (BIO 101, Inc., LaJolla, CA) according to the manufacture's instruc- tions. DNA sequencing was carried out using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI system 3700, Applied Biosystem Inc., Foster City, CA).\n\nUsing the DNA Basic module (DNAsis MAX, Alameda, CA), the nt and deduced amino acid (aa) sequences of the partial capsid gene (717 bp; did not contain primer pair sequences) and the p289/290 products were compared with those selected from other known caliciviruses (Table 2) .\n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on the nt and aa alignments were constructed using the neighborjoining method and the UPGMA method of molecular evolutionary gentetics analysis (MEGA version 3.1) with a pairwise distance (Kumar et al., 2004) . A sequence similarity search was performed for the porcine calicivirus capsid and the RDRP protein using the LALIGN Query program of the GENESTREAM network server at Institut de G\u00e9n\u00e9tque Humaine, Montpellier, France (http://www.eng.uiowa.edu/ $tscheetz/sequence-analysis/examples/LALIGN/ lalign-guess.html). The recombinant viruses were identified using the recombinant identification program (RIP, http://hivweb.lanl.gov/RIP/RIPsubmit.html) (Siepel et al., 1995) .\n\nIn order to determine the prevalence of porcine SaVs in Korean piglets with diarrhea, a total of 237 fecal samples from diarrheic pigs in 78 farms were screened by RT-PCR and nested PCR using five sets of primer pairs (Table 1 ). The RT-PCR and nested PCR revealed different sensitivities for porcine SaVs according to each primer pair (Table 3) . Between the RT-PCR and nested PCR analyses for the porcine (Table 3) . A primer pair p289/290 was originally designed to detect both NoVs and SaVs by RT-PCR (Jiang et al., 1999b) . Moreover, RT-PCR using this primer under low stringency was reported to be able to detect rotaviruses according to their cross-reactivity (Ludert et al., 2004) . In order to determine if fragments amplified by this primer pair were from NoVs or rotaviruses, eight DNA fragments that had been amplified by RT-PCR with the same primer pair were sequenced (Table 3 ). Their nt sequences were similar to the porcine SaVs but not to noroviruses or rotaviruses (data not shown).\n\nOf the 69 porcine SaV-positive fecal specimens from 22 porcine herds with diarrhea, 29 fecal samples (12.2%) from four herds (5.1%) tested positive for the porcine SaV alone, while the other 40 fecal samples (16.9%) from the 18 herds (23.1%) also tested positive for other enteric pathogens (Table 4 ). In addition, 105 fecal specimens from the 45 herds that tested negative for porcine SaV also tested positive for other enteric pathogens (Table 4) . No enteric pathogens were detected in 63 fecal samples from 11 herds. (Table 5 ). In contrast, there were no positive fecal samples obtained from Chungnam province. However, this might have been due to the low number of fecal samples analyzed.\n\nThe genetic diversity of the porcine SaVs and their genetic relatedness to human strains was investigated by sequencing 757 nt of the nt 5698 to nt 6454 region of the capsid gene from 12 porcine SaVs which were amplified strongly by RT-PCR. By drawing comparisons of the deduced aa sequences among the caliciviruses within Caliciviridae, the porcine SaVs showed low aa identity with the human SaV (17.7-35.1%), the human NoV (11.1-13.3%), rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) (13.9-18.2%), and feline calicivirus (FCV) (10.6-14.3%) strains. Among the porcine SaVs examined, the paired comparisons showed the two strains with the most similar sequence identity to be the Po/SaV/JB-IS122/ 05/Korea (GIII-1) and Po/SaV/JN-MA128/05/Korea (GIII-1) strains (99.1%), whereas the Po/SaV/JN-MA113/05/Korea (GIII-2) and Po/SaV/JN-MA130/ 05/Korea (GIII-1) strains (67.7%) showed the lowest shared sequence identities. In addition, the most distant strains between the Korean and American porcine SaVs were those of the Po/SaV/JN-SC58/04/ Korea (GIII-1) and Po/SaV/OH-MM280/03/US (GIII-1) strains, sharing 69.1% aa identity. On the other hand, the closest strains between the Korean and American porcine SaVs were the Po/SaV/JB-JE133/ Korea (GIII-1) and Po/SaV/OH-JJ259/00/US (GIII-1) strains, sharing 90.2% aa identity.\n\nThe intra-and inter-cluster distances among the 17 porcine SaV capsid sequences were compared in order to determine if genogroup III porcine SaVs belongs to a new genotypes. The UPGMA phylogenetic analysis based on the 717 nt sequence and its deduced 239-aa capsid sequence showed that all the Korean SaVs were clustered within genogroup III (Fig. 1) . Genogroup III of the porcine SaVs could be further divided into at least two genotypes. The inter-cluster distance between the Po/SaV/JN-MA113/05/Korea (potential GIII-2 genotype) and GIII-1 strains was 0.236-0.405. When the inter-cluster distance between the Po/SaV/ JN-MA113/05/Korea and GIII-1 strains was compared, the inter-cluster distance became 0.302-0.405 with the exception of the Po/SaV/JB-JE91/05/Korea strain. The inter-cluster distances were also comparable to the distances between the established GI and GII because the distance between GII-1 and GII-4, and GII-2 and GII-3 was 0.254-0.273 and 0.273-0.283, respectively. This data supports the assignment of two new genetic clusters within genogroup III of the porcine SaVs.\n\nSeven strains, which were amplified by both primer pairs for the partial RdRp region (380 bp) and the capsid gene (757 bp), respectively, were selected to determine if the potential recombination events occurred between the porcine SaVs (Table 5) In order to determine if recombination occurred between the porcine SaVs, RIP analysis was performed by placing the partial RdRp (380 bp) and partial capsid (757 bp) sequence of Po/SaV/JB-IS123/ 05/Korea, Po/SaV/JN-YG69/05/Korea, Po/SaV/JB-JE91/05/Korea and Po/SaV/Cowden/80/US strains ( Fig. 2A and B) . The Po/SaV/JB-IS123/05/Korea strain showed high homology with the Po/SaV/ Cowden/80/US strain in the RdRp region but it changed to a shared high homology with the Po/SaV/ JN-YG69/05/Korea strain in the capsid region ( Fig. 2A) . The Po/SaV/JN-YG69/05/Korea strain changed abruptly to a high identity with the Po/ SaV/JB-JE91/05/Korea strain in the capsid region (Fig. 2B) .\n\nLike other RNA viruses, human SaVs show broad genomic sequence diversity between circulating strains, which is partly due to the poor template fidelity of their RNA polymerases (Green et al., 2001) . The genetic divergence of porcine SaVs in different countries is unavailable because the sequence data of only a few porcine SaVs (mainly from the US) is available. In this study, genetically variable porcine SaVs from swine were detected in South Korea and their genetic relationship with human and other porcine SaVs as well as to the other three genera (Lagovirus, Vesivirus, and Norovirus) in the Caliciviridae were examined. Analyses of the partial capsid genes of the 12 porcine SaVs showed that they shared a lower aa and nt sequence identity with the human SaVs, human and animal NoVs, FCV and RHDV, which is consistent with a previous report (Wang et al., 2005a) . The aa identity within the GIII porcine SaVs ranged from 67.7 to 99.1%, in which the genetic divergence was observed not only among Korean porcine SaVs but also between the Korean and American porcine SaVs. This suggests there is genetic variability in the porcine SaVs belonging to genogroup III. In addition, all the Korean and most US porcine SaVs sequenced belonged to the SaV/GIII genotype. Therefore, these results, along with others (Farkas et al., 2004; Guo et al., 1999; Schuffenecker et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2005a) , indicated that SaV/ GIII is the dominant genogroup of porcine SaVs.\n\nPairwise nt sequence and phylogenetic distance analysis of the partial capsid gene sequences provide useful information for identifying potential new genetic clusters for SaVs (Farkas et al., 2004; Schuffenecker et al., 2001) . Although pairwise and phylogenetic analyses allowed the human SaVs within all genogroups to be divided into at least nine genotypes, the porcine SaVs could not be classified into genotypes because the sequences of only a few porcine SaVs have been reported. Interestingly, this study identified one strain (Po/SaV/JN-MA113/05/ Korea) forming a second new porcine SaV/GIII genotype, which is tentatively called GIII/2. This strain had a 0.236-0.405 inter-cluster distance with the other strains in the same genogroup, which is comparable to the distances between the established GI and GII SaVs. Whether or not the two genotypes among the GIII porcine SaVs identified in this study represent sero-or antigen-types cannot be predicted based on their sequence alone. Therefore, more detailed antigenic analysis of porcine SaVs will be needed to understand their diversity and evolution as well as to develop classification schemes that can reduce the level of confusion and assist international molecular epidemiological studies.\n\nAll the recombination events occurred in the RdRp-capsid junction region, whose nucleotide sequence is generally well conserved among the NoV and SaV genotypes (Jiang et al., 1999a; Katayama et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2005a) . This conservation is likely to facilitate a recombination event when the nucleic acid sequences of the parental strains come into physical contact with infected cells, e.g., during copy choice recombination (Worobey and Holmes, 1999) . Therefore, genetic recombination may be a common mechanism for generating diversity among the genotypes or genogroups. Recombinant viruses within SaVs and NoVs have been reported in humans, cattle and pigs (Han et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 1999a; Katayama et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2005a) . In this study, it was found that the Po/SaV/JN-YG69/04/ Korea was a potential recombinant strain between the Po/SaV/JB-JE91/05/Korea-like strain (RdRp region) and the Po/SaV/JB-IS123/05/Korea-like strain (capsid, after RdRp) of the same genotype. In contrast, the Po/SaV/JB-IS123/05/Korea was a potential recombinant strain between the Po/SaV/Cowden/80/US-like strain (RdRp region) and the Po/SaV/JN-YG69/04/ Korea-like strain (capsid, after RdRp) of the same genotype. In South Korea, post-weaning piglets introduced into each farm are frequently sourced from different farms in different provinces, which suggest that the Po/SaV/JN-YG69/04/Korea strain has different geographic origins. Because South Korea imports live pigs from the US, American porcine SaV strains may be the parent strains of the recombinant viruses such as the Po/SaV/JB-IS123/05/Korea strain. Therefore, the capsid gene diversity of the porcine SaVs detected in these farms is most likely to be a reflection of this diverse geographic sourcing.\n\nSince a porcine SaV infection was first reported in the US in 1980s (Saif et al., 1980) , it has only been reported in a few countries including the US, Netherlands, Venezuela and the United Kingdom (Bridger, 1990; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2006; Saif et al., 1980) . However, the precise epidemiology of porcine SaV infections in the other countries is not known. We previously reported the prevalence of porcine SaV infections in South Korea during the 2001-2002, in which 8.8% of diarrheic fecal samples tested positive by nested PCR . However, the more recent status of porcine SaV infections is unknown. This paper presents a large-scale epidemiological study of the prevalence of porcine SaV infections in diarrheic piglets in South Korea during 2004-2005. Although five sets of primer pairs were used to detect those porcine SaV strains, it is likely that some strains escaped detection. At this time, no primer pair or combination of primers appears suitable for the universal detection of porcine SaVs. However, among those primer pairs, the PECnF/nR primer pair used for nested PCR showed high sensitivity in detecting porcine SaVs. When fecal samples were determined to be positive based on at least one positive fecal sample detected by each primer pair, porcine SaVs were detected in 29.1% fecal samples obtained from six provinces. Overall, the high prevalence and widespread geographical distribution of porcine SaVs suggest that these viruses are widespread in piglets with diarrhea in South Korea. In addition, it is not known why there was a higher prevalence of porcine SaV infections during 2004-2005 compared with during 2001-2002. One possible explanation is that the SaVs infections might have been spread out to many more farms after 2001-2002. Porcine SaVs are believed to be the causative agent of piglet diarrhea because they induce enteric disease in gnotobiotic piglets and cause pathology in the small intestine (Flynn et al., 1988; Guo et al., 2001a, b) . However, it is possible that other porcine enteric pathogens play a role in the clinical and pathological presentation of this disease. This is because many other enteric viruses have been found to be associated with diarrhea in piglets and cause lesions of villous atrophy [transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), groups A, B, C porcine rotaviruses (PRV A-C), etc.]. In this study, 12.2% diarrheic fecal samples tested positive for porcine SaVs alone, while 16.9% of diarrheic fecal samples testing positive for porcine SaVs and other pathogens including the PRV A-C, PEDV, etc. This suggests that a number of enteric pathogens, either singly or in combination, can influence the clinical course of porcine SaV infections.\n\nPorcine NoVs have been detected in the fecal samples of adult pigs (Sugieda et al., 1998; van Der Poel et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2005b) . In order to determine if porcine NoVs are involved in piglet diarrhea, a RT-PCR assay was performed with the primer pair p280/290, which was designed to detect NoVs, SaVs and rotaviruses (Jiang et al., 1999b; Ludert et al., 2004) and all the positive fragments were sequenced. Their nt sequences were similar to the porcine SaVs but not to the NoVs or to the rotaviruses, which suggests that NoVs are less likely to be involved in piglet diarrhea in the age groups tested. This might explain why porcine NoVs have only been detected in the normal feces of adult or finisher pigs but not in piglets (Sugieda et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2005b) .\n\nIn summary, this study identified genetically diverse porcine SaVs consisting of at least two genotypes and two potential recombinant porcine SaVs (Po/SaV/JB-IS123/05/Korea and Po/SaV/JN-YG69/04/Korea strains), which were analogous to a previously reported human and porcine SaV recombinant. In addition, these results demonstrate that porcine SaV infections are widespread in piglets with diarrhea in South Korea."}
