In direct transmission, a pathogen can infect a susceptible host through infected host, and in 10 indirect transmission, a pathogen can infect a susceptible host through an infected vector. For instance, 11 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (1) and Zika virus (2) may be spread both policies have been found very effective (5; 6) in decreasing the rate of infection at the late stage of SARS outbreak, even when the number of infective individuals were getting larger relatively. Additionally, the influenza pandemic of 2009 has triggered a psychological effect that caused adoption of preventive 23 measures by a significant portion of the population (4). Recent MERS-CoV outbreak in Arabian penin-24 sula also imposed a significant behaviour change in the local people (1) . Thus, psychological effects 25 are necessary in modelling infectious disease transmission. The general incidence rate in this context at time t is given by N v (t) = S v (t) + I v (t). We assume all newborn hosts are fully susceptible. The susceptible host population increases at a constant rate \u03a0 h . The susceptible population decreases due to 66 getting infection from infected vectors and infected hosts and natural mortality at a rate \u00b5 h . Therefore \n\nInterpretations of all the model parameters and their biological meanings are given in the Table 1 . We assume that the vector and host state variables are non-negative for all t \u2265 0. Let\n\nWe claim the following result.\n\nTheorem 3.1. Whenever the initial conditions are non-negative, model (2.1) has non-negative solutions and the region \u2126 \u2208 R 5 + is positively invariant and globally attracting for the above system. 84 Proof. We can rewrite the system (2.1) in the following form 85 86 dy dt = g(y) (3. 1) with y = (y 1 , y 2 , y 3 , y 4 , y 5 ) = (S h , I h , R h , S v , I v ) and g(y) = (g 1 (y), g 2 (y), g 3 (y), g 4 (y), g 5 (y)) denote the 87 right hand side of the functions as in the following 88 89\n\nClearly, for every j = 1, ..., 5, g j (x) \u2265 0 if y \u2208 R 5 + and y j = 0. Since the host and vector populations 90 are non-negative, thus the right hand side of the system (3.1) is locally Lipschitz in \u2126. Following (12) 91 and (13), we see that the system (2.1) has a unique solution. The following equations are satisfied by 92 the total host and vector populations, if R 0 > 1.\n\nProof. The Jacobian of the system (2.1) at DFE Y 0 is given as follows\n\n(3.5)\n\nThen the characteristic equation of (3.5) is given by\n\nThe eigenvalues of this jacobian matrix is \n\nNote that \u03bb is the EGR for the 'SIR' sub-model of the system (2.1) and is given by\n\nIf there is no indirect transmission through vector(\u03b2 i \u2192 0), then the system (2.1) becomes the 129 sub-model (3.8) and \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb. Additionally, from (3.6), it can be noted that\n\nThe mean time spent in the infected host class is dependent on the host lifetime, the mean infectious 137 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/486720 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\n(3.12)\n\nProvided, the observed growth rate \u03bb obs is equal to the EGR \u03bb for the 'SIRSI' model (2.1). Since \n\nProposition 2. Let R 0 > 1 and R 0 is fixed for system (2.1). Let d\u03bb d\u03b2 i denote the total derivative of \u03bb 159 with respect to \u03b2 i . Then d\u03bb d\u03b2 i < 0.\n\nProof. The EGR \u03bb is explicitly dependent on both \u03b2 i and \u03b2 d . From the analytical expression of R 0 , \u03b2 d 161 can be determined in terms of \u03b2 i as,\n\n(3.7) is involved in the expression of R SIRSI 0 given by (3.10). We will calculate the total derivative of \u03bb:\n\nSince R 0 is fixed and using (3.13), the total derivative of (3.10) gives\n\n(3.14)\n\n(3.15)\n\nWe have R 0 > 1, \u03bb \u2265 \u03bb and \u03bb > 0. Finally, \u00b5 v > 0. Thus, the numerator become positive and the 165 denominator is negative in (3.15), giving that d\u03bb d\u03b2 i < 0.\n\nNow we calculate the relationship of d\u03bb d\u03b2 i with \u2202\u03bb \u2202\u03b2 i and \u2202\u03bb \u2202\u03b2 d as follows:\n\nCorollary 3.1. Let R 0 > 1 and the initial EGR \u03bb be given by (3.6).\n\nTo verify this result numerically, sensitivity index of \u03bb with respect to the parameters \u03b2 d and \u03b2 i 169 are computed. The normalized forward sensitivity index of a quantity with respect to a parameter 170 is defined as the ratio of the relative change in the variable to the relative change in the parameter.\n\nMathematically, the normalized forward sensitivity index of a variable m that depends explicitly on a 172 parameter \u03c4 is defined as:\n\nThe normalized forward sensitivity indices of \u03bb with respect to the parameters \u03b2 d and \u03b2 i are found to\n\nfor the parameters value \u03a0 h = 5,\n\nThe fact that X \u03b2 d \u03bb = 1.6631 means that 1% increase in \u03b2 d , keeping other parameters fixed, will produce In this section we discuss the existence of endemic equilibria and its stability conditions.

When the multiple stable equilibrium coexist then the population will reach 386 the final equilibrium depending on the initial conditions. Backward bifurcation phenomenon for the 387 system (2.1) is shown in Fig. 1 . Here, a stable DFE and a stable endemic equilibrium point coexist 388 when 0 < R c < R 0 < 1, where R c is the critical value, which is shown in Fig. 1 and R c = 0.274 for the 389 given parameters values. In Fig. 1 , the green line represents the unstable equilibrium, while the blue line is established analytically. The Jacobian of the system (3.2) at diseases free equilibrium Y 0 is given as\n\nLet \u03b2 i be the bifurcation parameter and using R 0 = 1, we have\n\nHere 0 is the simple eigen value and the jacobian J(Y 0 ) at \u03b2 i = \u03b2 * i has a right eigen vector corresponding eigen vector is given by\n\nThe following second order partial derivatives of g i at DFE Y 0 are calculated as follows: \n\nWe see that the coefficient b is always positive, hence the system (2.1) undergoes backward bifurcation\n\nThe backward bifurcation phenomenon would occur for those values of R 0 such that R c < R 0 < 1. \n\nFor forward transcritical bifurcation usually a model has two locally stable branches, one is DFE 427 when R 0 < 1, which is locally asymptotically stable and another is endemic equilibrium when R 0 > 1, 428 which is stable. But there may be more than one stable endemic equilibrium for the model when R 0 > 1.\n\nIt is possible that more than one endemic equilibrium coexist in epidemic models even when R 0 > 1.\n\nThis leads to an unusual phenomenon of forward bifurcation with hysteresis effect, which is shown 431 numerically for our model (2.1). We find that our model exhibits a hysteresis effect where multiple 432 endemic equilibrium coexist for R 0 > 1 (see Fig. 2 ). The blue line represents two outer equilibrium, 433 which is stable while the green line represent the interior equilibrium, which is unstable. Further investigation reveals that the endemic equilibrium may also be stable in a region where 435 R 0 < 1 (see Fig. 3 ). This indicates that the disease may persist for R 0 < 1, even if the type of 436 transcritical bifurcation at R 0 = 1 is forward. Similarly, in case of hysteresis, these control measures will compel the solutions to the basin of attraction 447 of the lower endemic equilibrium. Here, we control the indirect transmission rate (\u03b2 i ) for a certain period 448 of time, to force the solutions of the system to lower endemic value. We use the following to model this\n\nFor backward bifurcation case, we observe that a solution of the system approaches the upper equi- The vector-host interaction is assumed to be well-mixed in the proposed model 2. \n\nSimilarly, the transmission term from infectious hosts to susceptible vectors is given by:\n\nHere k 1 and k 2 are the levels of heterogeneity of vector-host and host-vector transmissions respec-480 tively. Since k 1 and k 2 both are the levels of heterogeneity, we assumed that k 1 = k 2 = k for simplicity.\n\nTherefore, replacing these heterogeneity terms into our model 2.1, we obtain the following system of \n\nUsing numerical simulations, the impact of the heterogeneity parameter k have been studied.

Further, we investigated the sensitivity of the parameters k, \u03b2 i and \u03b2 v with respect to the equilibrium 492 susceptible and infected host levels, Table 4 . It is observed that the equilibrium infected host level 493 increases with increase in the parameter k. to switch the stability of equilibria. In case of backward bifurcation, temporary control can curb the 507 disease endemic equilibrium to disease free state. On the other hand, the system can be brought to lower 508 endemic levels by the employment of temporary control. We found that the strength of psychological 509 effect will have significant contribution in lowering the endemic infection level of the host population.\n\nFurther investigation reveals that increase in transmission heterogeneity will ensure fast eradication of 511 the disease.\n\nIn summary, global stability of the unique endemic equilibrium indicate that the disease will persist 513 under certain parametrization of the system. Additionally, the diseases with two transmission routes can 514 exhibit bi-stable dynamics. These bi-stable feature of the diseases may impose significant difficulties on 515 disease control strategies. Moreover, efficient application of temporary control will be helpful in bi-stable 516 regions. While investigating the effect of heterogeneity, we observe that high levels of heterogeneities 517 will result in slower disease spread. "}
