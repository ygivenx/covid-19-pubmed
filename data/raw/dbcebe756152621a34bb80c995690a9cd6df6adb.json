We thought it would be interesting to highlight a strategy developed by our medical faculty at the National University of Singapore for the teaching of neurology to our preclinical medical students, who were not allowed to enter hospitals during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore. 2 Our solution was to videotape patient examinations, showing the correct technique for performing each step of the examination. We sought consent for videotaping from all of our patients, and obtained videotaped vignettes of normal and abnormal examinations. We then designed a lecture teaching students how to localize the level of neurologic lesions using clinical signs, including videotaped vignettes to demonstrate signs such as ankle clonus, increased and decreased tone, motor power, and deep tendon reflexes. Realizing that merely observing signs was inadequate, we divided them into groups of 10 during these sessions and had them perform the neurologic examination on student volunteers in each group. We identified 2 advantages in using this strategy. First, the student volunteers were more amenable to being repeatedly examined (often for long periods) than regular patients would have been. Second, the student volunteers were more aware of the rigors of being subjected to repeated examinations, and could empathize with their patients. The program was so popular with our students that the neurologic localization lecture, with videotaped vignettes, has been incorporated for both our under-and postgraduate teaching.\n\nVideotaped vignettes are useful for teaching medical communication skills, 3 "}
