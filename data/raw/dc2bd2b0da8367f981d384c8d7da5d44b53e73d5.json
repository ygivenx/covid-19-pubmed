According to the World Health Organization (WHO) surveillance draft in January 2020, any traveler to Wuhan City in Hubei Province 2 weeks before the onset of the symptoms is suspected to be infected with COVID-19 (Bogoch et al., 2020 , Organization, 2020c . Additionally, the WHO distributed interim guidance for laboratories that carry out the testing for the newly-emerged outbreak, as well as infection prevention and control guidance (Organization, 2020a, b) . The COVID-19 pneumonia is suspected of having originated in a seafood market, with an unknown animal being responsible for the emergence of the novel virus (Hui et al., 2020) . There are now surveillance borders around the globe, attempting to prevent the spread of the new mysterious coronavirus (Parr, 2020) . Just two months ago, in mid-January, only 41 cases had been confirmed to be COVID-19 positive, leaving one person dead and 7 in critical care (Yang, 2020) . These numbers are continually increasing each day, and the number of confirmed cases at the time of this writing has now exceeded 258,000, with 11,268 confirmed deaths, mostly in China, Europe, and the Islamic Republic of Iran. On 20 January 2020, the National Health Commission of China confirmed human-to-human transmission of the COVID-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Based on its nucleotide sequences, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of Betacoronaviruses, such as the SARS and MERS HCoVs (Chan et al. , 2015 , Ibrahim et al. , 2020 .\n\nCurrently, seven different strains of human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been reported, including the 229E and NL63 strains of HCoVs (Alphacoronaviruses), and the OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 HCoVs (Betacoronaviruses) , Hui et al., 2020 , WHO, 2016 . The SARS and MERS HCoVs are the most well-known and aggressive strains of coronaviruses, each causing approximately 800 deaths. According to the WHO, the mortality rates for SARS and MERS HCoV are 10% and 36%, respectively. (B\u00e1ez-Santos et al. , 2014 , Hemida and Alnaeem, 2019 , Organization, 2019 , WHO, 2016 . The next few months will reveal the mortality of the new virus; a nearly 4.1 % mortality rate for a flanking viral spread may mean millions of deaths.\n\nHCoVs are positive-sense, long (30,000 bp), single-stranded RNA viruses. Two groups of proteins characterize HCoVs: structural proteins, such as Spike (S) marking all coronaviruses, Nucleocapsid (N), Matrix (M), and Envelope (E); and non-structural proteins, such as proteases (nsp3 and nsp5) and RdRp (nsp12) . RdRp is a crucial viral enzyme in the life cycle of RNA viruses; hence, it has been targeted in various viral infections, including the hepatitis C virus (HCV), the Zika virus (ZIKV), and coronaviruses (CoVs) (Elfiky, 2016 , Elfiky, 2017 , Elfiky and Elshemey, 2016 , Elfiky et al. , 2013 , Elfiky and Ismail, 2019 , Elfiky and Ismail, 2017 , Ganesan and Barakat, 2017 . The active RdRp site is highly conserved, with two successive and surface-accessible aspartates in a beta-turn structure. (Doublie and Ellenberger, 1998 , Elfiky, 2020a , Elfiky and Ismail, 2018 .\n\nIn this study, the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp model was built using the SARS RdRp solved structures from the NCBI protein data bank (Berman et al. , 2003) . After model validation, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f molecular docking was performed to test several direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, including 5 FDA-approved medications used to treat HCV, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the Ebola virus; 13 compounds in clinical trials against HCV; and two negative control compounds, in addition to the physiological nucleotides GTP, CTP, UTP, and ATP. The results were promising and suggest possible inhibition from the currently available therapeutics against the newly emerged coronavirus (Wu et al. , 2020) .\n\nThe newly-emerged SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide gene (NC_045512.2) was retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nucleotide database (NCBI, 2020). A homology model for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp was built using the Swiss Model web server (Biasini et al. , 2014) . We used the SARS HCoV solved structure (PDB ID: 6NUR, chain A) as a template for building our model since it was the most sequelogous solved structure (97.08% sequence identity) to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. 6NUR is a SARS HCoV non-structural protein 12 (nsp12) solved structure (cryo-electron microscopy) with 3.1 \u00c5 resolution, which was deposited in the protein data bank in 2019 (Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019) . Two web servers were used to examine the model: the MolProbity web server of Duke University, and the Structure Analysis and Verification Server (SAVES) of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\n\n(SAVES, 2020, Williams et al. , 2018) . Various types of software were used to judge the validity of the model, such as PROCHECK (Laskowski et al. , 1996) , Verify 3D (Eisenberg et al. , 1997) , PROVE (Joan Pontius, 1996) , and ERRAT (Hooft et al. , 1996) , in addition to the Ramachandran plot of the MolProbity web server. After validation, the model was optimized (classical J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f mechanical, using the MM3 force field) with assistance from the computational chemistry workspace SCIGRESS of Fujitsu (Elfiky, 2020b , Elfiky and Elshemey, 2018 , Elfiky and Ismail, 2019 , Summers et al. , 2012 . Model minimization was performed after the addition of missed hydrogen atoms to prepare for the docking study (Lii and Allinger, 1989) .\n\nAutoDock Vina software was utilized in all of the docking experiments, with the optimized SARS-CoV-2 RdRp model as the docking target (Trott and Olson, 2010) . In addition, SARS HCoV RdRp (PDB ID: 6NUR) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural protein 5B (NS5B) RdRp (PDB ID: 2XI3) were used as docking targets for comparison. A total of 24 compounds were tested against SARS-CoV-2, SARS HCoV, and HCV NS5B RdRps, namely, the four physiological nucleotides (GTP, UTP, CTP, and ATP), five approved drugs against different viral RdRps (Galidesivir, Remdesivir, Tenofovir, Sofosbuvir, and Ribavirin), 13 compounds currently in clinical trials against HCV NS5B RdRp (Uprifosbuvir, Setrobuvir, Balaprevir, MK0608, R7128, IDX-184, 2'C-methylcytidine, BMS-986094, YAK, PSI-6130, PSI-6206, R1479, and Valopectibine), and two negative control compounds that did not have affinity toward RdRp (Cinnamaldehyde and Thymoquinone). All of the compounds were prepared to be optimized in their active forms in physiological conditions (Elfiky and Ismail, 2018) .\n\nAfter docking, the structures were examined using the Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler (PLIP) web server (Technical University of Dresden) (Salentin et al. , 2015) .\n\nBased on the sequence identity between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS RdRps, the Swiss model constructed a valid, high-quality model. Figure 1(B) . The SARS HCoV secondary structure (PDB ID: 6NUR) is shown at the top of the MSA, while its water accessibility is found at the bottom (highly accessible residues are in blue, while buried residues are white). The active site residues (D255 and D256) are circled and marked in the MSA. As implied from the MSA, the active site is highly conserved and water accessible in all 7 strains of the human coronaviruses (the red highlighting indicates identical residues, while the yellow highlighting represents conserved residues). The region surrounding the D255 and D256 residues is also conserved and mostly surface accessible in all HCoVs.\n\nFor SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, the percent sequence identity values against the SARS, MERS, OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1 HCoV strains were found to be 90.18%, 56.76%, 55.07%, 48.79%, 48.55%, and 48.16%, respectively. Therefore, SARS HCoV RdRp was determined to be the sequelogous strain to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, from which we could then build a reliable model.\n\nThe complete nucleotide genome for SARS-CoV-2 was determined to have sequence identities of 89.12% and 82.34% with bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate bat-SL-CoVZC45 and SARS coronavirus ZS-C, respectively.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 RdRp model (801 residues) was generated by homology modeling using the Swiss Model web server. The SARS HCoV RdRp (PDB ID: 6NUR, chain A) was employed as a template. The model exhibited a very high (97.08%) sequence identity to the template, suggesting that an excellent model was obtained. Testing of the model validity was mediated by the Ramachandran plot (100% of the residues in the allowed regions, 97.5% in the most favored region), Verify-3D (89.9% of the residues had average 3D-1D scores \u2264 0.2), and ERRAT (overall quality factor of 95.9%).\n\nPrior to testing the ligands against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, the structures of the small molecules were ensured to be in the optimized active (triphosphate) form. Optimization was performed using the classical MM3 force field, followed by the semi-empirical PM6 force field.\n\nAfter transition state checks, further optimization was performed using the B3LYP functional of density functional theory (DFT) quantum mechanics (Becke, 1993 , Leach, 2001 , Lii and Allinger, 1989 , Stewart, 2007 .\n\nDuring all of the docking experiments, the active site aspartates (D255 and D256 in the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS RdRp, and D318 and D319 in the HCV NS5B RdRp) were treated as flexible, and the ligands were also flexible. A grid box (30 \u00c5 \u00d7 30 \u00c5 \u00d7 30 \u00c5) centered at (142, 139, 150) \u00c5, (141, 139, 149) \u00c5, and (11, 6, 13) \u00c5, for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, SARS RdRp, and HCV NS5B RdRp, respectively, was used in the docking experiments by utilizing the AutoDock J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f tools (Morris et al. , 2009) . Figure 2 shows the docking score values for the SARS-CoV-2 (blue columns), SARS HCoVs (orange columns), and HCV NS5B RdRps (gray columns). The physiological compounds (GTP, UTP, CTP, and ATP) exhibited binding energies for SARS-CoV-2 between -7 (ATP) and -8.7 (GTP) kcal/mol. The two negative control compounds (Cinnamaldehyde and Thymoquinone) displayed low binding energies to all RdRps (-4.4 to -5.6 kcal/mol). The five approved drugs (Galidesivir, Remdesivir, Tenofovir, Sofosbuvir, and Ribavirin) surrounded by the dashed-green box in Figure 2 were also able to bind the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with binding energies of -7.0, -7.6, -6.9, -7.5, and -7.8 kcal/mol, respectively.\n\nThese drugs were able to bind to the new coronavirus strain RdRp tightly and hence may contradict the polymerase function. In addition, these drugs are potential candidates for inhibiting the RdRps of HCV NS5B (-8.0 to -9.5 kcal/mol) and SARS (-6.2 to -7.1 kcal/mol).\n\nOther compounds that are currently in clinical trials can bind to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with some showing promising results. Setrobuvir, IDX-184, and YAK (surrounded by red-dashed rectangles in Figure 2 ) exhibit firm binding to all of the RdRps (-9.3, -9.0, and -8.4 kcal/mol, respectively for SARS-CoV-2 RdRp). The binding energy values against RdRp for these compounds are better than the native nucleotides. IDX-184 is a guanosine derivative, and it competes for GTP binding with slightly better binding (-9.0 kcal/mol) than GTP (-8.7 kcal/mol).\n\nFurther analysis of the docking complexes is required to unravel their binding modes with the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.\n\nTo investigate the possible reasons for the differences in the binding energies, we examined the formed complexes with help from the PLIP web server. Figure 3(A) shows the formed interactions between the ligands GTP, Ribavirin, Sofosbuvir, and Tenofovir against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp after docking. GTP was found to form 8 H-bonds with RdRp residues D343, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f K442, T447, K512 (2), C513, D514, and S573. Additionally, GTP built six salt bridges with R444 (2), D509, and R515 (3) and two \u03c0-cation interaction with K689 from the SARS-CoV-2\n\nRdRp. This vast number of interactions gives the complex its stability with the -8.7 kcal/mol binding energy. This is comparable to the GTP-derivative IDX-184, shown in Figure 3 Based on the binding energy, the best compounds were discovered to be Setrobuvir (-9.3 kcal/mol), IDX-184 (-9.0 kcal/mol), and YAK (-8.4 kcal/mol). As previously mentioned, IDX-184 exhibited the same interaction pattern as its parent nucleotide (GTP) in binding the RdRp.\n\nOn the other hand, both Setrobuvir and YAK formed H-bonds, hydrophobic contacts, \u03c0-cation contacts, and halogen interactions. Setrobuvir formed 3 H-bonds (R444 (2) and K689), three hydrophobic contacts (D509, K689, and E702), a \u03c0-cation interaction with R444, and a halogen interaction with A653. YAK had 4 H-bonds (R444, K512 (2), and K689), two hydrophobic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f contacts (K689 and E702), a \u03c0-cation interaction, and a halogen interaction with the same residues of Setrobuvir, as seen in Figure 3 (B).\n\nIn summary, the five approved drugs (Galidesivir, Remdesivir, Tenofovir, Sofosbuvir, and Ribavirin) can bind to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with binding energies comparable to those of native nucleotides (see the graphical abstract). Moreover, the compounds IDX-184, Setrobuvir, and YAK can tightly bind to the newly-emerged coronavirus RdRp, hence contradicting the function of the proteins leading to viral eradication. Additionally, IDX-184 can be used as a seed for new compounds specific against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp active site. Further optimization of the compounds using the high-quality model of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp may result in a perfect compound able to stop the newly-emerged infection.\n\nOn 30 January 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The newly emerged coronavirus in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, is a health concern given that the last outbreaks of this type of virus "}
