{"title": "Roles of meteorological conditions in COVID-19 transmission on a worldwide scale", "body": "In the first season of 2020, an outbreak of atypical pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2 or 2019-nCoV) 1 has spread all over the world and had a great impact on public health and worldwide economy. This new virus has some relations to SARS-CoV but it is more aggressive than SARS, MERS, or the seasonal influenza 2 . It has exhibited relatively high human-to-human transmissibility compared to other coronavirus infections 3 To predict epidemic trend, meteorological conditions are suggested to be an important factor as well as population mobility and human-to-human contact. These meteorological factors such as humidity, visibility, and wind speed can affect droplet stability in the environment, or affect survival of viruses as air temperature does, and thus impact epidemic transmission. Air temperature and absolute humidity have been indicated to significantly influence the transmission of COVID-19. However, there are only five studies published on preprint hubs discussed the involvement of meteorological conditions in the spread of COVID-19 up to now, and they all focused on data from China without model validation or prediction.\n\nHerein, this study intends to investigate the relationship between meteorological factors and epidemic transmission rate at a systematical level on the world scale.

Those cities with over 50 confirmed cases monthly were taken as a discovery dataset to exclude the confounding effect due to purely imported cases. Four time points delay of the weather conditions from the day of epidemic situation evaluation were considered and compared to find the most possible time delay that best reveals the relationship between weather and COVID-19 outbreak. A multivariate polynomial regression model with factors of wind speed, relative humidity, and average air temperature was established, and then validated in 21 cities/ provinces in Italy, 21 cities/ provinces in Japan, and 51 other countries around the world. Finally, we use this model, in combination with weather forecast, to predict the probable outbreak in several high-latitude big cities around the world.\n\nEpidemiological data. Epidemiological data were collected from various sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO) 4 , China Center for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (especially for data in Italy), Japan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and DXY-COVID-19-Data, a Chinese website that aggregates national and local CCDC situation reports in near real-time 5 . The daily new confirmed case counts were collected from January 20, 2020 (i.e., WHO published the first situation report) to March 11, 2020 . For China, incidence data were collected for every city or district, leading to 430 sites covering the whole country. Considering the potential confounding effect, only cities with no less than 50 cumulative confirmed cases in one month and without official reports of imported cases in majority were taken into a discovery dataset. A second set of cities with 10~49 cumulative confirmed cases in one month was taken as an replication dataset (so called replication_China). For Italy and Japan, incidence data were collected for each province/ city/ district, in total, 21 .

For other countries, only incidence data at the country level were obtained. We scrutinized WHO's situation reports to rule out these countries with only imported cases, and only collected the confirmed cases with possible or confirmed local transmission (i.e., without recent travel history to China). The top 11 countries with high incidence of COVID-19 local transmission except China were selected for a replication dataset representing the world's situation (so called replication_world).\n\nWeather data. We obtained hourly values of meteorological observations from the Integrated Surface Database of USA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI, https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/isd) 6 . Temperature and dew point displayed in Fahrenheit were transformed into Celsius forms, and relative humidity (RH) was calculated from temperature and dew point using the following formula for each time point:\n\nwhere RH is the relative humidity, D is the dew point in degrees Celsius, T is the temperature in degrees Celsius, and e is the base of the natural log.\n\nDaily data were calculated by averaging the hourly data for each variable in each day.\n\nFor each city with epidemiological data, the meteorological station in that city or that was closest to the latitude and longitude coordinates of the city center was chosen. For a city with more than one meteorological stations, the one nearest to the city center was chosen. For a province with epidemiological data, the meteorological station in the capital city of that province was chosen. For a country with only nation-wide epidemiological data, weather data were averaged across all the meteorological stations in the cities where outbreak was officially reported. For Japan, the surveillance table of epidemiology only provides weekly data, thus daily weather of each week was averaged to obtain weekly meteorological data.\n\n.

The number of confirmed new cases on each day was taken as a dependent variable. Four meteorological variables, namely, air temperature, wind speed, visibility, and relative humidity, were taken as independent variables.\n\nConsidering that there is a latency stage from the day one get infected to the day being confirmed, a time delay of the day COVID-19 was confirmed from the day weather data were collected needs to be taken into consideration. As it is reported that the latency period for COVID-19 is 3~7 days on average and 14 days at most, four time points delay of virus infection were taken into consideration, that is, weather data were collected on the day, three days before, seven days before, 14 days before collecting the epidemiological data. At first, each meteorological variable was plotted against the confirmed new case counts for the Wuhan dataset, with four time delays display on one plot. Only one city Wuhan was chosen for illustrating the time delay effect because it is the original city where SARS-CoV2 was first uncovered, there could not be any imported cases for Wuhan, which might obscure the correlation between weather and virus transmission. A Loess regression interpolation approach was adopted to visually identify the relationship between meteorological variables and confirmed new case counts. After choosing the appropriate time delay, data from the discovery dataset were fitted into generalized linear model or non-linear model (basically polynomial and inverse models) according to the indentified relationship by Loess regression. Each of the four meteorological variables was fitted into models solely, and then two or three variables were combined together to fit complex models.\n\nAll these models were compared with the full model, to find a best fitted model with not many factors. Basic statistics and modeling was conducted in R 3.5.1 7 (mainly \"glm\", \"nls\", \"ggplot\" packages).\n\nModel validation and application. The best fitted model was validated in the replication datasets (replication_world, replication_Italy, and replication_Japan) by correlating the real epidemiological data with the predicted values from the model.\n\nWe used this best fitted model to predict future COVID-19 daily confirmed new cases with weather observations and forecasts in a sequence of 15 days for seven .

The confirmed new cases in Wuhan on February 13, 2020, reached 13,436, which was oddly high as the daily confirmed new cases were no larger than 3,000 on all the other dates in Wuhan or in all the other cities. We suppose that it might be due to supplement of enough virus test kits on that day. In order to reduce the potential contamination of modeling by this outlier, we substituted the counts on that day by four, that was 13,436/4=3,359, which was still the largest number but not deviated from the dataset too much. Except this outlier, the daily confirmed new cases in the discovery dataset ranged from 1 to 2997, the average temperature ranged -23.54\u2103 ~ 22.85\u2103, the wind speed ranged 1.33 ~ 26 miles per hour, visibility ranged 0.425 ~ 110 statute miles to nearest tenth, and relative humidity ranged 31.4% ~ 100%. The temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity ranges in the other replication datasets were similar to the discovery dataset, while the maximum visibility in the replication datasets was lower than that in the discovery dataset (Table 1) . .

The effects of all these four factors on confirmed new cases 14 days later all exhibited a parabolic or bell-shaped trend ( Figure 1 ). Thus, in the following analyses, epidemiological data were correlated with the weather data 14 days ago.\n\n.

Temperature and wind speed were fitted into quadratic models; relative humidity was fitted into a cubic model; visibility was fitted into two models, an inverse model when modeling in the discovery dataset and a quadratic model when modeling in the Wuhan dataset because distribution of visibility in the two datasets was different. We used these fitted models to calculate a predicted value for case counts for each studied site, and then compared this predicted value with the real observed case counts by calculating a Pearson's correlation coefficient between them. Model fitting results showed that using the Wuhan dataset for single-factor modeling produced better model fitness. There was 0.40, 0.24, and 0.35 correlation between the observed data for Wuhan and values predicted by average air temperature, relative humidity, and visibility, separately, while wind speed alone could not explain much of the variance in confirmed case counts ( Figure 4 ). According to the equation, SARS-CoV2 transmission reaches a peak when the air temperature is 8.07 \u2103, or when the wind speed is 16.1 mile/hr, or when the visibility is 2.99 statute miles to nearest tenth, or when the relative humidity is 64.6%.\n\n.

To fit the model with more data and thus more accuracy, we used the discovery dataset for modeling. In the model, temperature and wind speed were regarded as quadric-related, relative humidity was regarded as cubic-related, and visibility was regarded as inverse-related. The full model fitted was as follows: case counts = -0.1366T 2 + 3.6046T-0.3883SPD 2 + 20.2509SPD + 5929.9403/(VSB +19.1774)-505.8484RH 3 + 316.6004RH 2 + 189.1295RH-422.3774 .

When further reducing variables in the model to obtain a most parsimony and best fitted prediction model, we got better results. When visibility was removed from the model, the predicted values of the fitted model were more significantly correlated with the observed epidemiological data (r 2 = 0.624, p = 6.113e-05 for replication_world; r 2 = 0.287, p = 0.034 for replication_Italy; see Figure 5B & 6). This model, written as follows, was also best fitted compared to the full model and other 3-factor and 2-factor models, with the smallest AIC.\n\ncase counts = -0.18T 2 + 3.1628T -0.4385SPD 2 + 21.1420SPD -228.4231RH 3 -391.9561RH 2 + 880. in which T is temperature, SPD is wind speed, RH is relative humidity, VSB.\n\nWhen there were only wind speed and relative humidity in the model, we got a prediction that was most significantly correlated with the real data (r 2 = 0.637, p = 3.884e-05 for replication_world; r 2 = 0.310, p = 0.021 for replication_Italy; see .

Figure 8 showed the predicted daily case counts curve. It shows that COVID-19 outbreak in Milan and Toronto will sustain in the future 12 days, but exhibits a transient decrease on March 26; virus transmission in Paris and Cologne will increase and reached a peak on March 26, but quickly drop down after that day; the epidemic trend in New York will fluctuate in the following days.\n\n.

According to this theory, the year 2020 is predicted to be warm and dry, and plague often outbreaks in warm winter, so respiratory infectious diseases would be frequent in 2020. This theory and its inference are consistent with the current epidemic situation of COVID-19.\n\nPrevious studies have already implied the spread of many respiratory infectious diseases like influenza is dependent upon air temperature and relative humidity 8, 9 .\n\nRecent published papers 10- is an optimal temperature for SARS-CoV2 at 8.07 \u2103 and most cities with high epidemic transmission of COVID-19 locate in the humidity range of 60% ~ 90%, which is colder and more humid than Bu et al's suggestions. It might be due to that their conclusion was based on SARS data and their data collection was much earlier.\n\nOur optimal temperature 8.07 \u2103 is very close to the estimation by Wang et al, which is 8.72\u2103 13 . Oliveiros et al. regressed the doubling time of COVID-19 cases by temperature and humidity, and they did not find significant association for wind speed 14 . In our study, though wind speed was not an important factor if modeled singly, it is a necessary factor in the final model and adding wind speed in the model would significantly improve model prediction performance.

It suggests that caution about outbreak should be taken if visibility drops below 10 statute miles to nearest tenth. Upon now, all of these studies focused only on data from China, with very few worldwide data implemented. Our research investigated the worldwide data more thoroughly and explored a set of meteorological factors systematically.\n\nNone of the published research has considered the influence of imported cases in modeling. In our study, when collecting epidemiological data for other countries in the world, those cases with travel history to China or indicated by WHO as \"imported case only\" were excluded, leaving the world data most likely local transmitted.\n\nHowever, it's difficult to separate the imported cases from local transmission for Chinese cities, as there was a dramatic and complex migration due to Spring Festival.\n\nIt might explain why the predicted values for Wuhan and countries other than China correlated with the observed data much better than those for Chinese cities other than Wuhan. Future research should investigate the epidemiological data more carefully and thoroughly to distinguish imported cases and local transmission. A final prediction model is proposed in the current study, which is easy to use for estimating the future 14-day epidemic trend of COVID-19 by using weather observations in the past two weeks. However, if strict control on population movement and clustering is implemented, the real case counts might deviate from the predicted values. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\n(which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.16.20037168 doi: medRxiv preprint"}
