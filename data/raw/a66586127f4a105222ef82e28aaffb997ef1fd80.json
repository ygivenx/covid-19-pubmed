{"title": "Enantioselective syntheses of carbocyclic nuleosides 5\u2032- homocarbovir, epi-4\u2032-homocarbovir and their cyclopropylamine analogs using facially selective Pd-mediated allylations", "body": "Carbocyclic nucleosides have been extensively targeted due to their potent antiviral and anti-cancer activities. 1 Naturally occurring deoxynucleotides are needed to synthesize viral DNA. Carbovir (\u2212)-1 and related compounds are analogs of natural deoxynucleotides and compete for incorporation into the growing viral DNA chain. 2 Incorporation of dideoxynucleosides such as carbovir results in chain termination and disruption of the viral replication process. 3 In particular, carbovir (\u2212)-1 has shown significant in vitro anti-HIV activity through its triphosphate analog by inhibiting HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. 2 Its congener, abacavir (\u2212)-2, has a considerably improved toxicity profile and higher oral bioavailability. 4 Abacavir is metabolized to the triphosphate of carbovir by a unique mechanism that circumvents formation of carbovir itself. 5 Consequently, abacavir has in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy against HIV. It has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of HIV infection under the brand name Ziagen. 6 Due to the important activity of carbocyclic nuclosides, there is continued interest in the syntheses of new analogs. One approach has been to extend the 4\u2032-carbon sidechain. 7 Although the enantioselective syntheses of 5\u2032-homocarbovir (\u2212)-3a and 5\u2032-homoabacavir (\u2212)-3b have been reported 8 (Figure 1) , only 5\u2032-homocarbovir (\u00b1)-3a9 has been evaluated in antiviral assays and showed poor activity in limited testing.9a To further investigate the activity profiles of (\u2212)-3a as well as the previously untested (\u2212)-3b, we developed a new synthetic route from an acylnitroso-derived hetero Diels-Alder cycloadduct, which utilizes decarboxylative rearrangements of allyl 2,2,2-trifluroethylmalonates to install the 4\u2032hydroxyethyl side chain. The modification of a single step in the sequence allowed for access to the unprecedented epi-4\u2032 analogs (+)-4a and (+)-4b.\n\nOur research group's continued interest in the syntheses of diverse carbocyclic nucleosides10 , 11 has led to the development of a reliable method for the synthesis of cyclopentenol (\u2212)-7. 12 We recently reported the Cp 2 TiCl-catalyzed reduction of Boc cycloadduct (\u00b1)-6. 13 The reaction was performed on large scale (50 mmol) and an isolated yield of 79% was obtained after the resultant silylated alcohol was deprotected with a simple acidic work-up with 1M HCl (Scheme 1). Kinetic enzymatic resolution of (\u00b1)-7 was achieved with commercially available immobilized Candida antartica B lipase to ultimately form the enantiopure alcohol (\u2212)-7. 12 Cyclopentenol (\u2212)-7 was coupled with 3-oxo-3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)propanoic acid 8 to form allyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl malonate (\u2212)-9 in high yield (Scheme 2). As previously reported, malonate (\u2212)-9 underwent facile decarboxylative rearrangement in the presence of Pd(dba) 2 and dppe to provide homoallylic ester (\u2212)-10 with complete diastereo-and regiocontrol. 14 Formation of the \u03c0-allyl palladium complex proceeded on the less hindered face and anti attack by the in situ generated nucleophilic alkoxyethenolate species afforded the product with retention of configuration. Reduction of (\u2212)-10 with 2 eq. of diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL-H) yielded the desired alcohol (\u2212)-11. 14 We then turned our attention to construction of the chloroguanine base. 15 Upon deprotection of the Boc group with 12 M HCl, aminoalcohol (\u2212)-11 underwent nucleophilic aromatic substitution with 2-amino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine to afford alcohol (+)-12 in 50% yield over two steps (Scheme 3). Azo coupling of (+)-12 with 4chlorobenzenediazonium chloride followed by reduction of the resulting aryl azo compound with Zn in acetic acid afforded triaminopyrimidine (\u2212)-13. 2-Propanol was selected as the co-solvent over ethanol due to the formation of side products from reaction with ethanol. 16 Cyclization of (\u2212)-13 with triethyl orthoformate in the presence of catalytic acid provided chloroguanine (\u2212)-14. Careful monitoring of the reaction time was necessary to prevent substitution of the 6-Cl group with ethanol, which formed an inseparable byproduct. 17 Chloroguanine (\u2212)-14 was refluxed in 0.33M NaOH for 2 h to produce 5\u2032-homocarbovir (\u2212)-3a in 60% yield (Scheme 4). Alternatively, (\u2212)-14 was stirred in 2-propanol at 70 \u00b0C in the presence of excess cyclopropylamine to form 5\u2032-homoabacavir (\u2212)-3b in 80% yield.\n\ntrans-Carbocyclic nucleosides have been reported in the literature. 18 The synthetic routes towards these molecules were specifically designed around formation of the necessary anti-1,4-aminocyclopentene. We envisioned a route that required minimal modification from our method to (\u2212)-3a and (\u2212)-3b. Cyclopentenol (\u2212)-7 was treated with 3-oxo-3-(2,2,2trifluoroethoxy)propanoic acid 8 under Mitsunobu conditions to form allyl 2,2,2trifluoroethyl malonate (\u2212)-15 in high yield with the expected inversion of configuration at C-4\u2032 (Scheme 5). Pd(0)-mediated decarboxylative rearrangement of allyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl malonate (\u2212)-15 proceeded with complete diastereo-and regiocontrol. The retention of configuration during this process is again noteworthy. Reduction of (+)-16 with 2 eq. of diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL-H) yielded the desired alcohol (+)-17. With the new C-4\u2032 stereochemistry established, construction of the chloroguanine base proceeded as described for the synthesis of the syn-1,4-disubstituted cyclopentene derivative. Chloroguanine (+)-20 was synthesized in five steps from alcohol (+)-17.\n\nChloroguanine (+)-20 was refluxed in 0.33M NaOH for 2 h to produce epi-4\u2032-homocarbovir (+)-4a in 60% yield (Scheme 6). Alternatively, (+)-20 was stirred in 2-propanol at 70 \u00b0C in the presence of excess cyclopropylamine to form epi-4\u2032-homoabacavir (+)-4b in 90% yield. The epi-4\u2032 derivatives proved to be slightly more polar compounds than (\u2212)-3a and (\u2212)-3b but were amenable to purification by column chromatography. \n\nThe decarboxylative allylations of allyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl malonates were the key steps en route to 5\u2032-homo-carbocyclic nucleoside core structures. Inversion of the C-4\u2032 stereochemistry at the appropriate stage allowed for the synthesis of new epi-4\u2032-homocarbocyclic nucleoside analogs without an increase in the number of synthetic transformations. Compounds (\u2212)-3a, (\u2212)-3b, (+)-4a and (+)-4b were evaluated for antiviral activity.\n\nCommercially available reagents and anhydrous solvents were used without further purification unless otherwise specified.
