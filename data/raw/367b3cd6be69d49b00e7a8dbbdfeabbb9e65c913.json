{"title": "Amodiaquine, an antimalarial drug, inhibits dengue virus type 2 replication and infectivity HHS Public Access", "body": "Dengue virus (DENV), mosquito-borne member of flavivirus genus of Flaviviridae family has a positive-strand RNA genome. The four serotypes of DENV cause 390 million infections annually (Bhatt et al., 2013; Mitka, 2013) . Secondary infections by a different DENV serotype could lead to severe clinical manifestations due to antibody dependent enhancement. Currently, there is no vaccine or antiviral drug available to combat dengue diseases.\n\nDENV RNA encodes a single polyprotein which is processed to yield 3 structural proteins, capsid (C), precursor membrane (prM), and envelope (E), and 7 nonstructural (NS) proteins, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 (Lindenbach et al., 2007) . For viral RNA replication, cis-acting RNA elements encoded within the 5'-and 3'-untranslated regions (UTR), coding regions within the N-terminal capsid protein and the C-terminal envelope as well as the 7 NS proteins are sufficient (for excellent reviews, see (Lindenbach et al., 2007; Paranjape and Harris, 2010; Villordo and Gamarnik, 2009; Westaway et al., 2003) . To study the cis-acting RNA elements and trans-acting viral and host factors required for replication, subgenomic replicons have been constructed for several flaviviruses, Kunjin (Khromykh and Westaway, 1997) , WNV (Alcaraz-Estrada et al., 2013b; Shi et al., 2002) , YFV (Jones et al., 2005a) , DENV2 (Alvarez et al., 2005; Jones et al., 2005b; Manzano et al., 2011; Ng et al., 2007) , and DENV4 (Alcaraz-Estrada et al., 2010) . Stable replicon expressing cell lines have been used in screening antiviral compounds as potential inhibitors of viral replication (for reviews, see (Noble et al., 2010; Sampath and Padmanabhan, 2009 ). Since flavivirus RNA encodes several enzymes that play important roles in the virus life cycle, in vitro assays have been developed for screening antiviral compounds. For example, in vitro assays for the twocomponent viral protease, NS2B-NS3pro (Lai et al., 2013; Mueller et al., 2008; Yusof et al., 2000) , 5'-RNA methyltransferase catalyzed by the N-terminal domain of NS5 (Dong et al., 2008b; Egloff et al., 2002; Ray et al., 2006) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) catalyzed by the C-terminal domain of NS5 (Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001; Niyomrattanakit et al., 2011; Niyomrattanakit et al., 2010) . These assays have been useful to identify inhibitors of protease (Ezgimen et al., 2012; Johnston et al., 2007; Lai et al., 2013) , 5'-RNA methyltransferase ; reviewed in (Dong et al., 2008b) ), and RdRp (Niyomrattanakit et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2011; Zou et al., 2011) by small molecule compounds.\n\nUsing in vitro protease and reporter replication-based assays, we identified compounds containing the 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-OHQ) scaffold as the potent inhibitors of both DENV2 and WNV proteases (Ezgimen et al., 2012; Lai et al., 2013; Mueller et al., 2008) . In this study, we sought to investigate whether quinoline derivatives that are already known FDA-approved antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine, amodiaquine, and primaquine could inhibit viral proteases as well as replication of DENV and WNV.\n\nAmodiaquine dihydrochloride dihydrate (4-[(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)amino]-2(diethylamino methyl)phenol) (AQ), (Catalog # A2799-5g) was obtained from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Quinoline derivatives were obtained from National Cancer Institute/Developmental Therapeutics Program (NCI/DTP) in 10 mg quantities. The compounds were dissolved in DMSO unless otherwise stated to make up 50 mM stock solutions, and were stored as aliquots at \u221220 \u00b0C. For some experiments, an aqueous solution of AQ was used as indicated.\n\nThe construction of DENV2 Renilla luciferase reporter replicon has been described previously (Manzano et al., 2011) . The construction of an expression plasmid encoding DENV2 Renilla luciferase (Rluc) reporter replicon containing the selectable marker, neomycin resistance gene (Neo r ) and the stable BHK-21 cell line are described under Supplementary Methods ( Fig. S1 and Table S1 ).\n\nBHK-21 cells expressing DENV2 replicon (BHK-21/DENV2), Vero cells expressing DENV4 (Vero/DENV4) (Alcaraz-Estrada et al., 2013a) , and WNV (Vero/WNV) (Alcaraz-Estrada et al., 2013b) replicons were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), nonessential amino acids (Mediatech, Manassas, VA), 100 I.U./ml penicillin, 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (penicillinstreptomycin), and 300 \u00b5g/ml G418 (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Cells (~10 4 /well) were seeded into 96-well \u00b5Clear black microtiter plate (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC) and were incubated for 6 h at 37 \u00b0C under CO 2 (5%) followed by addition of the compounds in 1% DMSO. at final concentrations as indicated. DMSO (1%) alone was used as the noinhibitor control (100% luciferase activity or 0% inhibition). Cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for indicated time points (for example, 24 h for experiments shown in Table 1 ; 48 h for experiments shown in Fig. 2 ). Cells were lysed and Renilla luciferase (Rluc) activities were measured according to manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) using a Centro LB 960 luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN). Data were reported as percent inhibition relative to 1% DMSO (0% inhibition) and mycophenolic acid (100% inhibition) as controls. Selected compounds showing greater than 80% inhibition were further analyzed to determine the effective concentration at which 50% inhibition was obtained (EC 50 ). To calculate the EC 50 values compounds were serially diluted to final indicated concentrations (0, 0.1, 1.0, 5.0, 10, 25, 50, 100 \u00b5M for experiments shown in Table  1 , or expanded serial dilutions described in Fig. 2 legend) , and the % activity values at various concentrations of the compound were plotted in nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism v5 software (La Jolla, CA).\n\nCytotoxicity of AQ was evaluated by two methods. First, na\u00efve BHK-21 or Vero cells were treated with compounds in parallel to the replicon cells. This method was used in evaluating CC 50 of 24 h treatment of the 4 selected compounds. The cell viability was assessed by measuring the ATP level using CellTiter-Glo \u00ae luminescent cell viability assay kit (Promega) according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, na\u00efve BHK-21 or Vero cells (~10 4 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates. Cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 \u00b0C. Compounds were added at the same concentrations as in the replicon assays as described in Table or figure legends. CellTiter-Glo \u00ae substrate was added according to manufacturer's protocol and the plate was read in a luminometer. Data were analyzed to determine the 50% cell viability (CC 50 ) value using GraphPad Prism v5 software.\n\nIn the second method, the viability of replicon expressing cells to various concentrations of each compound was measured in the same sample used for luciferase activity measurements using Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Rockville, MD) at 2 h before lysis and Rluc activity measurements. This colorimetric assay utilized highly soluble and non-cytotoxic tetrazolium salt (WST-8), added to the experimental cultures, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. The plate was read at A 58 5nm using the Concert TRIAD spectrophotometer (Dynex, Chantilly, VA). Cells were washed, lysed, and the Rluc activities were measured as described above. CC 50 values were calculated using the GraphPad Prism v5 software.\n\nBHK-21 cells were seeded into 12-well plate (10 5 cells/well) and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. Cells were infected with DENV2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 or 1 as indicated. After infection, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 1.5 ml of MEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 100 I.U./ml penicillin/100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (referred as maintenance medium). AQ at indicated concentrations was added and cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for various time points as indicated. DMSO (1%), as a no-compound control (100% infection), and mock-infected control using medium alone (0% infection) were included. Supernatants were collected from the time point experiments and the virus titers determined by plaque assay.\n\nBHK-21 cells were seeded at ~10 5 cells/well (12-well plate) or ~5 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well (24-well plate) and then incubated at 37 \u00b0C until reaching 90% confluence. Cells were infected with the supernatants collected from experiments of AQ treatments. Cells were washed with PBS, and incubated with 1.5 ml of overlay medium (maintenance medium containing 1% methylcellulose). The plates were incubated for 3-4 days at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO 2 . After plaques became visually apparent by microscopy, cells were fixed and stained with 11.1% formaldehyde, 4.75% isopropanol, and 1% crystal violet for 30 min. The number of plaque forming units (PFU) per ml was determined.\n\nBHK-21 cells were seeded as described above. AQ at indicated concentrations in 1% DMSO was added to DENV2 (MOI of 0.01 or 1)-infected cells during adsorption and/or postinfection. Supernatants were collected at indicated time points post-infection for plaque assays.\n\nIntracellular RNAs were extracted from the infected cells by treatment with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Life, Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNAs were quantified using Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and adjusted to 1 \u00b5g/\u00b5l for reverse transcription (iScript cDNA synthesis, BioRad, Hercules, CA). Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) was performed as previously described (Manzano et al., 2011) . Briefly, the region of viral RNA encoding DENV2 NS1 gene was amplified using the forward and reverse primers (DENV2 NS1-F and DENV2 NS1-R; Table S1 ). The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GAPDH) was chosen as the housekeeping reference RNA and amplified by PCR using the forward and reverse primers (Table S1 ). The viral RNA copy numbers were calculated in AQ-treated cells relative to the DENV2infected and AQ-untreated cells (1% DMSO alone). Supernatants from the experiment were also collected and stored as aliquots (1 ml) at \u221270 \u00b0C until use. Supernatant were concentrated by Amicon-15 (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Viral RNAs were extracted by QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (QIAgen, Valencia, CA) prior to cDNA synthesis as described above.\n\nThe protocol was adapted from Stahla-Beek et al. (Stahla-Beek et al., 2012) . BHK-21 cells were grown in 6-well plates (~2.5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well) and were infected with DENV2 at a MOI of 0.01 in the maintenance medium. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 3 ml of maintenance medium. AQ at indicated concentrations was added and cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C. Supernatants were sampled as indicated and stored at \u221270 \u00b0C for plaque assays.\n\nThe protocol was adapted from Schmidt et al. (Schmidt et al., 2012) . BHK-21 cells were grown in 12-well plates and were treated with AQ in one of three ways. In 1), AQ (5 \u00b5M) and DENV2 (MOI of 1) were diluted in maintenance medium and incubated for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C before adding to BHK-21 cells (pre-incubation). In 2), the mixture of AQ and DENV2 was added to BHK-21 cells directly (co-infection). In 3), BHK-21 cells were infected with DENV2, or mock-infected with 1% DMSO containing medium (1 h at 37 \u00b0C), washed, and incubated with medium containing AQ (post-infection). Supernatants were collected at 24, 48, 72 h post-infection for plaque assays.\n\nThe protocol was adapted from Wang et al. . BHK-21 cells were grown in 12-well plates and infected with DENV2 (MOI of 1). AQ (5 \u00b5M) or DMSO alone (1%) was added to DENV2-infected cells at different times post-infection as indicated. Supernatants were collected at 72 h post-infection to determine the titer by plaque assay.\n\nIn addition, we performed a time of addition assay with a slight modification to study the effect of AQ (5 \u00b5M) on viral translation by collecting more samples as indicated within the first 12 h after addition of AQ or DMSO (1%) (MOI of 1). Supernatants were collected at 48 h postinfection for plaque assay.\n\nAntimalarial quinoline compounds were screened using BHK-21/DENV2 and Vero/WNV replicon cells (Table S2 and Fig. S2 ). Antimalarial compounds that were tested at 50 \u00b5M final concentration include 4-aminoquinoline derivatives such as chloroquine (CQ; 3), chloroquine ethyl phenyl mustard (4), chloroquine mustard (5), chloroquine pamoate (6), chloroquine sulfate (7), amodiaquine (AQ; 1), 6-methoxyquinoline derivatives such as apoquinine (2), primaquine (8), and quinine (11), quinine hydrobromide hydrate (10) and an acridine derivative, quinacrine mustard (9). AQ (1), having a diethylaminomethyl group showed 76.31 \u00b1 1.60 % and 96.30 \u00b1 0.39 % inhibition of DENV2 and WNV replicon replication, respectively. Two chloroquine derivatives and one acridine derivative (compounds 4, 5, and 9 in Table 1 ) having a mustard group showed > 99 % inhibition of both BHK-21/DENV2 and Vero/WNV replicon replication (Fig. 1A) . These derivatives contain a common side chain, a dichloroethylamino group, also known as a mustard group. However, the compounds, 4, 5, and 9, had low TI values in the range of 2-3 in inhibition of Vero/WNV replicon replication due to their cytotoxicity to Vero cells (Table 1) . However, compounds with a dichloroethylamino side chain have known cytotoxicity and potential to form skin-blisters (Keyes, 2004; Welsh et al., 2004) . Therefore, compounds 4, 5, and 9 were not pursued further.\n\nBased on the results of the primary screening (Fig. 1A) , eight AQ derivatives (AQD1-8) (Table S2) were obtained for further analysis. AQD1, AQD3, AQD4, AQD6, and AQD7 showed strong inhibition of DENV2 and WNV replicon replication (Fig. 1B) . However, none of AQDs showed higher TIs than AQ due to their cytotoxicity (low CC 50 values; Table  1 ). Our results further showed that compounds lacking a diethylamino methyl group adjacent to phenolic OH moiety (AQD5 and AQD8) failed to inhibit the replicon replication with EC 50 values of ~100 \u00b5M (described in Section 3.4. below).\n\nEC 50 and CC 50 of the compounds were tested in BHK-21/DENV2, Vero/DENV4, and Vero/WNV replicon cells and their therapeutic indices (TIs) were calculated. TI value of AQ was 7.03 in BHK-21/DENV2 replicon cells, with the EC 50 of 7.41 \u00b1 1.09 \u00b5M ( Fig. 2A) whereas in Vero/DENV4 cells, the TI of AQ was only 1.14 ( Fig. 2B) , and that in Vero/WNV cells it was 4.98 ( Fig. 2C ) due to the cytotoxicity of AQ to Vero cells. We verified that AQ did not interfere with the Rluc enzyme activity when added to the BHK-21/ DENV2 replicon cell lysate (Fig. S3 ).\n\nNext, we analyzed the effect of AQ on the intracellular and extracellular DENV2 RNA levels as well as the virus infectivity in BHK-21 cells. The viral replication was quantified by qRT-PCR and the virus infectivity by plaque assay. Cells were treated with a fixed concentration of AQ (5 \u00b5M) and the infected cells were incubated for 72 h (Fig. 3A) . Results showed a significant difference (p < 0.001) between the AQ-treated and untreated groups.\n\nThe results indicate that AQ effectively inhibited DENV2 replication with the reducing levels of intracellular and extracellular RNAs. The virus infectivity measured as PFU/ml of supernatant from the AQ-untreated and AQ (5 \u00b5M)-treated cells by plaque assay also showed a significant reduction upon treatment with the drug (Fig. 3A) . Taken together, these results support the conclusions of results using BHK-21/DENV2 replicon cells (Figs. 1 and  2 ).\n\nNext, we sought to determine the EC 50 and EC 90 values for AQ-mediated inhibition of extracellular release of DENV2 from the infected BHK-21 cells. To this end, BHK-21 cells were infected with DENV2 and treated with AQ at various concentrations as indicated. The supernatants collected at 72 h (MOI of 1) or 96 h (MOI of 0.01) post-infection were analyzed by plaque assay. The virus titers at various concentrations of AQ were plotted using GraphPad Prism v5 software. The EC 50 value of 1.08 \u00b1 0.09 \u00b5M (MOI of 1) (GraphPad plot not shown) and EC 90 values of 2.69 \u00b1 0.40 \u00b5M (MOI of 1) as well as EC90 of 2.71 \u00b1 0.85 (MOI of 0.01) from an independent experiment are shown (Fig. 3B ).\n\nThe results thus far indicated that AQ inhibited DENV2 replication in the stable repliconexpressing cells as well as the virus titers and RNA copy numbers in DENV2 infected BHK-21 cells as shown by plaque assays and qRT-PCR. All subsequent experiments were performed in BHK-21 cells infected with DENV2 to determine the stage of the virus life cycle targeted by AQ.\n\nFirst, a time course of DENV2 infectivity in the absence and presence of different concentrations of AQ ( Fig. 4A and 4B ). AQ was added to the DENV2 infected cells during adsorption and the compound was present throughout the duration of the experiment (96 h) post-infection. As shown in Fig. 4 , in mock-infected control cells (1% DMSO alone), DENV2 infectivity titer gradually increased over time. However, in the AQ-treated cells, the virus titers (PFU/ml) were reduced significantly in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05) ( Fig.  4A and 4B ). At 5 \u00b5M, the plaque formation was reduced \u2265 90%. The observation that the AQ-mediated inhibition increased over time indicating that AQ was stable at least up to 96 h post-infection.\n\nTo analyze AQ's effect on viral entry, AQ at various concentrations was incubated with DENV2 (MOI of 0.01) on the BHK-21 monolayer for 1 h adsorption period, and then overlay medium in the absence of drug, was added and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 3-4 days as described under Materials and Methods. Data obtained from this experiment is referred to as direct plaque assay (Fig. 4C, stippled bars) . Concurrently, virus supernatants collected from cells infected with DENV2 in the presence 1% DMSO or AQ present during and up to 96 h post-infection were also used for plaque assay (referred as indirect plaque assay). The virus titers were determined as above (Fig. 4C, open bars) . The virus titers from indirect plaque assays (Fig. 4C , open bars) showed significant inhibition of DENV2 infectivity by AQ at 5 \u00b5M similar to the results shown in Fig. 4, A and B . However, in the direct plaque assay, since AQ was present only during adsorption, the plaque titer at 5 \u00b5M AQ was not significantly different from the titer at 1 \u00b5M and its DMSO control (Fig. 4C, stippled bars) . These results indicate that AQ at 5 \u00b5M does not inhibit DENV2 adsorption. However, the virus titer was reduced by 69.23 \u00b1 1.57 % and 82.70 \u00b1 2.48 % when treated with AQ at 10 and 25 \u00b5M, respectively, during adsorption (Fig. 4C, stippled bars) . The results indicate that the inhibition of DENV2 entry requires a higher concentration of AQ (10 or 25 \u00b5M) than that is required to inhibit infectivity when added post-infection (5 \u00b5M).\n\nTo confirm that AQ had the optimal inhibitory effect on DENV2 replication when added during post-infection period, we expanded the order of addition of AQ at various time points in three different ways as follows. In 1), a mixture of AQ and DENV2 (MOI of 1) were incubated for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C prior to addition to BHK-21 cells. In 2), AQ and DENV2 (MOI of 1) were simultaneously added to BHK-21 cells. In both cases, after adsorption, the cells were washed and incubated with maintenance medium in the absence of AQ. In 3), AQ was added to BHK-21 cells at post-adsorption with DENV2 and it was present throughout post-infection period up to 72 h. Supernatants were collected at 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection for plaque assay (Fig. 4D) . Results indicated that the inhibition of DENV2 infectivity by AQ was maximum (\u2265 90% reduction of plaque titer from its DMSO control) at 48 and 72 h post-infection (Fig. 4D, striped bar) . These results indicated that the major step for inhibition of DENV2 infectivity by AQ is post-entry and fusion events, possibly at viral translation, replication, or assembly of the virus.\n\nNext, to pinpoint the post-infection stage of inhibition more precisely, we added AQ at 5 \u00b5M to DENV2 infected BHK-21 cells (MOI of 1) at various time points post-infection as indicated. Supernatants were collected at 72 h post-infection and were analyzed for timedependent plaque reduction. The plaque reduction by \u2265 90% was found even when the drug was added as late as 15 h post-infection (Fig. 4E ). At 21 h post-infection and later time points, the drug lost its inhibitory effect.\n\nWe investigated the effect of AQ within the first 12 h post-infection to examine whether AQ is a translational inhibitor similar to a compound with benzomorphan core structure . Results indicated that addition of AQ up to 12 h inhibited DENV2 infection steadily (Fig. 4F) and even added at 15 h post-infection (Fig. 4E) beyond which there was a steady increase in titer (loss of inhibition), suggesting that AQ could inhibit early events including translation of viral RNA templates released from the endosomes and events prior to assembly of viral RNA replicase complex and on-set of viral RNA replication (Fig. 4 , E and F).\n\nFrom the analysis of AQ and its derivatives using BHK-21/DENV2 replicon cells, compounds lacking a diethylaminomethyl group, AQD5 and AQD8, failed to inhibit replicon replication. The EC 50 values were ~100 \u00b5M (Table 1 and Table S2 ), at least 10-fold higher than that of AQ. We chose AQD8 for further study using the infectivity assay. AQD8 at various concentrations was added to DENV2 infected BHK-21 cells (MOI of 1). After 72 h incubation, supernatants were collected and the virus titers were determined by plaque assay. Results showed an EC 90 of AQD8 at 31.20 \u00b1 5.15 \u00b5M (Fig. 5) , which is more than 10 fold higher compared to that of AQ (EC 90 of 2.69 \u00b1 0.47 \u00b5M). Thus, AQD8 has a modest potency in inhibition of replicon replication and viral infectivity. These results indicate that the diethylaminomethyl group is a key chemical structural moiety of AQ contributing to inhibition of DENV2 replication and infectivity.\n\nNext, we sought to investigate the effect of CQ, another FDA-approved antimalarial drug and a 4-aminoquinoline derivative, (Fig. S2 ) on the replication of DENV2. BHK-21 cells were infected with DENV2 at a MOI of 1 and treated with CQ at various concentrations. The virus titers of the supernatants were determined by plaque assay. As shown in Fig. 5 , CQ inhibited DENV2 replication in BHK-21 cells in a dose-dependent manner (EC90 = 5.04 \u00b1 0.72 \u00b5M) although it did not inhibit DENV2 replicon replication (Fig. 1) . These results suggested that the inhibition of CQ is at either an early stage such as virus entry or at a late stage such as virus assembly into infectious particles.\n\nThe above findings supported the notion that AQ targets a factor functioning in viral replication. The factor could be of either viral or host origin. We first investigated whether AQ could be an inhibitor of the viral protease activity of NS3, or the 5'-RNA methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activities of NS5 using established in vitro biochemical assays.\n\nWe first tested the effect of AQ on DENV2 NS3 protease using the fluorescence-based in vitro protease assay (Lai et al., 2013; Li et al., 2005; Yusof et al., 2000) . The IC50 value of AQ for inhibition of DENV2 protease was \u2265 250 \u00b5M (Fig. S4A) and AQ up to 500 \u00b5M had no effect (data not shown). Hence, the viral protease is not the likely target of AQ.\n\nNext, we investigated whether the 5'-RNA methyltransferase activity of the N-terminal domain of DENV2 NS5 could be the target of AQ. The N-terminal domain of NS5 has activities for both N-7 and 2'-O methylations to form the type I cap (Dong et al., 2008a; Ray et al., 2006) and the full-length NS5 (NS5 FL ) was two-fold more efficient in the formation of type I cap (data not shown). Therefore, we used the NS5 FL for the in vitro assay to test the effect of AQ. The results indicated that AQ did not inhibit the formation of type I cap by NS5 FL up to 1 mM (Fig. S4B ).\n\nNext, we examined whether RNA synthesis catalyzed by the NS5 RdRP enzyme might be the target of AQ. Both positive (+) and negative (\u2212) strand RNAs were used as templates in an in vitro RdRP assay in the presence of 50 \u00b5M AQ for 60 min. Inhibition of RdRP activity by AQ was only 10.58 \u00b1 0.94 % for positive-strand RNA synthesis. No inhibition (\u221217.12 \u00b1 4.37 %) was observed for the negative-strand synthesis (Fig. S4C) , suggesting that DENV2 RdRP is not a likely target of AQ.\n\nNS3 is endowed with ATP-dependent RNA helicase activity (Benarroch et al., 2004; Li et al., 1999; Shiryaev et al., 2009; Yon et al., 2005) . We attempted to use a fluorescence-based assay (Boguszewska-Chachulska et al., 2004; Frick et al., 2004; Lam et al., 2004) for NS3 RNA helicase in which a partially double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide was used as a substrate for NS3 RNA helicase to study the efficacy of amodiaquine. One strand of the substrate was labeled with the fluorophore, fluorescein, and the other with the black hole quencher such that there is no fluorescence in the absence of NS3. The incubation with the NS3 helicase released the fluorescein-labeled strand in a time-dependent manner. Although the assay was successful in measurement of the helicase activity of NS3, amodiaquine interfered with the assay due its binding to the substrate as reported previously (O'Neill et al., 1998 ) (data not shown).\n\nAmodiaquine (AQ) was synthesized in 1980s by addition of 4-hydroxyanilino group to chloroquine (CQ). AQ was proven effective against chloroquine-resistant strain (reviewed in (O'Neill et al., 1998) ). The drug was later withdrawn from long-term antimalarial prophylaxis due to its rare but serious side effects, agranulocytosis and hepatotoxicity (WHO 1990, reviewed by (Olliaro and Mussano, 2003) ). Cochrane systematic review in 1996, however, supported the use of AQ for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Besides, an adverse drug reaction study found no significant difference among CQ, AQ, and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine antimalarials (reviewed by (Olliaro and Mussano, 2003) ). This impact enforced WHO 1997 to modify its recommendation such that AQ became an optional treatment of uncomplicated malaria (reviewed by (Olliaro and Mussano, 2003) ). AQ regimen for antimalarial treatment is three days of 600-800 mg/day in an adult. Pharmacogenetic studies have discovered a genetic trait in patient population who are susceptible to an adverse effect of hepatotoxicity due to AQ linked to polymorphisms of CYP2C8 gene, one of the cytochrome P450s. The genetic variants of CYP2C8 gene, CYP2C8*2 and CYP2C8*3, were reported to be responsible for defective metabolism resulting in slow clearance of AQ (reviewed by (Kerb et al., 2009) ). The genotypes, CYP2C8*2 and CYP2C8*3, were recorded in African and Caucasian population with the frequency of 11-17%, and 15%, respectively. Dose-adjustments of AQ and increased safety precautions are required for treatment of patients with these polymorphisms in order to prevent the intoxication. Given the anti-dengue efficacy shown in this study, AQ is likely to become a powerful candidate for treatment of DENV infected patients.\n\nWe studied the mode of inhibition of DENV2 replication and infectivity by AQ and investigated the potential targets of AQ using in vitro enzyme assays. Time-course analysis suggested that the drug was stable and reproducibly inhibited DENV2 infectivity up to 96 h post-infection. We also learned that the viral entry and internalization was partially inhibited by the drug but the major effect of drug occurred at a later stage of the viral life cycle up to 15 h post-infection. This effect of AQ at early stages (adsorption/entry) would be absent in replicon-expressing cells and hence the EC 50 values are higher (Table 1 and Fig. 2) . AQ was also ineffective to inhibit replication that is already established as seen in the time of addition assays. A previous study showed that DENV2 replication starts 12 h post-infection as suggested by rapid increase of intracellular RNA levels in BHK-21 cells quantified by qRT-PCR (Shrivastava et al., 2011) . In this study, we have shown that the drug was less effective when added later than 15 h post-infection as measured by viral infectivity (Fig.  4E-F) . Based on our results, we conclude that early stages of virus life cycle including translation, assembly of viral replicase complex and initiation of viral RNA replication could be targets of AQ.\n\nIt has been reported that AQ is a potent inhibitor of histamine-N-methyltransferase (E.C. 2.1.1.8) with a Ki of 18.6 nM (Horton et al., 2005) . The crystal structure of two molecules of AQ in complex with histamine-N-methyltransferase at the SAM binding pocket, and the nearby outer pocket were solved (Horton et al., 2005) . Another crystal structure of AQ in complex with phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase from Plasmodium falciparum at SAM binding pocket was also reported . However, our results excluded the 5'-RNA methyltransferase and the RdRP activities of NS5 as well as the protease activity of NS3 as the targets of AQ. Viral replication requires both viral and host factors (reviewed in (Bollati et al., 2010; Ivanyi-Nagy and Darlix, 2012; Sampath and Padmanabhan, 2009) ). It is possible that AQ targets a nonstructural protein without an enzymatic function or an unknown host factor(s) required for replication. Isolation and characterization of AQ-resistant mutants and mapping these mutations by sequence analysis might reveal the identity of the putative viral target. Although most of the DENV2 infected BHK-21 cells die within 12 days in the presence of 5 \u00b5M AQ (unpublished results), a longer incubation period, up to 30 days, might yield escape mutants (Teramoto et al., 2008) . An in vitro RdRP system (Ackermann and Padmanabhan, 2001; Nomaguchi et al., 2003) could provide an insight into whether the replication initiation factors of viral replication are targets of AQ.\n\nIn this study, we provide evidence that another antimalarial compound, CQ, inhibited DENV2 infectivity with an EC 90 of 5.04 \u00b1 0.72 \u00b5M consistent with the results reported by a previous study (Farias et al., 2013) . In the study by Farias et al. (2013) , the maximum inhibitory effect was seen between 6 and 24 h of incubation whether the CQ was added at 1 h after infection with no further addition, or CQ replenished after 12 h and 24 h after initial addition at 1 h. This inhibitory effect of CQ is past the entry and fusion events, well into translation and initiation of replication phases. Moreover, in our study, we provide evidence showing that the profile of inhibition of DENV by CQ is similar to that by AQ (Fig. 5 ) as the effect of AQ was lost when added after ~15-20 h post-infection ( Fig. 4E and 4F ).\n\nCQ seems to have diverse antiviral effects depending on the virus. For example, in the HIV-1 infection of primary, or established T or monocytes, CHQ did not seem to inhibit entry or production of steady state levels of HIV-1 mRNA but did affect the production of HIV-1 virions (Sperber et al., 1993) . CQ has been reported to increase the intracellular pH and interferes with prM to M cleavage at the virion maturation step in DENV2 life cycle but 100 \u00b5M concentration was used in that study (Randolph et al., 1990) . CQ has been other therapeutic applications. For example, CQ is being used in a randomized controlled clinical study for treatment of dengue in Vietnamese adults (Tricou et al., 2010) . CQ has also been to have antiviral activities against HIV-1 ( Solomon and Lee, 2009; Sperber et al., 1993) and SARS Coronavirus (De Clercq, 2006; Vincent et al., 2005) as well as for treatment of cancer and arthritic diseases. Moreover, ferroquine (FQ), a CQ derivative structurally similar to AQ, inhibited HCV infection at an early step by interfering with fusion (Vausselin et al., 2013) and had minor inhibitory effects on viral replication and assembly. From the currently available data, we conclude that each quinoline compound interferes at a different stage in flaviviral life cycle. Further studies are required to identify the target and precise step that is targeted by AQ as well as derivatives of the drug that are least cytotoxic for treatment of DENV infected patient population.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material. type 2 nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) by interaction with NS5, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. .
