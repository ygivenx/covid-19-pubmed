{"title": "Structural Features and the Persistence of Acquired Proteins", "body": "Most free-living bacteria have obtained and incorporated alien DNA, with the result that a large fraction of the variation in the size and contents of microbial genomes, even among the strains of same species, is attributable to horizontally acquired sequences [1, 2] . Due to the very large number of sequenced genomes that are currently available, it is often possible to apply phylogenetic or similarity-based approaches to pinpoint the source and origins of acquired DNA [3, 4] . Whereas many foreign genes have counterparts in other organisms, bacterial genomes frequently contain lineage-, species-, strain-, or genome-specific genes, termed ORFans, that have no recognizable homologs in the current sequence databases [5, 6] . For example, the presence of over 500 strain-specific ORFan genes accounts for most of the difference in genome size between E. coli CFT073 and E. coli K12 [7, 8] . ORFan genes have been detected in virtually all sequenced organisms, and they can constitute up to 14% of the annotated genes in a bacterial genome [9] .\n\nSeveral hypotheses have been put forward to account for presence of ORFan genes in bacterial lineages [5, 10, 11, 12] . One such hypothesis is the recurrent insertion of palindromic elements or domains into existing open reading frames resulting in genes that, due to complex sequence rearrangements, are beyond the detection limits of existing computational approaches [13, 14] . But, based on the sequence characteristics, it was proposed that ORFans represent genes principally of viral origin [6] , and a more recent study found that a small fraction of ORFans have viral gene homologs [8] . Moreover, the presence of mycobacterial ORFans in several mycobacteriophages further suggests that phage serve as vehicles for the origin, transfer and integration of these genes into bacterial genomes [15] .\n\nAlignments of the ORFan gene homologs that are confined to the bacterial clade containing E. coli and Salmonella revealed that most ORFans represent functional protein-coding regions, as apparent from their low Ka/Ks values [6] . Many ORFan genes from E. coli and other species have been shown to be transcribed [16, 17, 18] . Recent studies on mimivirus proteomes revealed that more than 10% of the ORFan-encoded proteins display antigenic properties suggesting that many encode functional proteins [19] . The occurrence of putative transmembrane domains and repetitive sequences in several viral orphan proteins also indicates a possible role in metabolic exchange and nucleic acid interactions during host infections [20] . Moreover, orphan proteins contain large numbers of aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine) resulting, in part, from the A+T-rich base composition in their coding sequences [21] . Interestingly, aromatic amino acids have been hypothesized to play some role in generating new protein functions as well as to stabilize protein structures by creating long hydrophobic aromatic side chains [22, 23, 24, 25] . But, because bacterial ORFans rarely exhibit significant sequence similarity to known proteins, and genome-wide mutagenesis studies have typically failed to assign phenotypes to the vast majority of ORFan genes [26] , their functions have remained elusive.\n\nConsiderable progress towards the functional assignment of ORFan-encoded proteins has been made by computational approaches, including the analysis of conserved residues or motifs and of 3D structural models [27, 28, 29] and by structural characterization via NMR and X-ray crystallography [30, 31] . Since ORFans encode unique proteins, and are therefore likely to confer novel functions, it is perhaps not surprising that many of the novel domain folds deposited in the databases are derived from ORFans [32, 33, 34] .\n\nTo understand the structural similarities between ORFans and characterized proteins, and to begin resolving new structures that might be unique to ORFans, we expressed and purified ORFan-encoded proteins, which were then subjected to structural analysis by CD spectroscopy. By analyzing ORFans that originated at different times during the evolution of the gammaproteobacterial lineage leading to E. coli, we show that ORFans genes that persist in bacterial genomes are more likely to encode soluble, folded proteins with significant secondary structure content.\n\nGenes were selected for analysis based on their phylogenetic distributions in the lineage leading to E. coli MG1655, as reported in Daubin and Ochman [6] . For each gene in the E. coli MG1655 genome, those authors distinguished clade-specific (i) ORFans, which are genes assigned parsimoniously to a particular ancestral lineage and having no homologs outside of the descendents of this lineage, and (ii) HOPs (Heterogeneous Occurrence in Prokaryotes), which are genes that were assigned parsimoniously to a particular ancestral lineage and having homolog(s) in a bacterial genome outside of the descendents of this lineage (suggesting an origin by horizontal transfer). Because ORFans and HOPs can originate at any time over the evolutionary history of a lineage, their relative ages can be inferred from their phylogenetic distributions. For the present study, the target genes were selected from clades of different phylogenetic depths -clade n 0 , restricted to the E. coli MG1655 genome; n 1 , ancestral to all E. coli strains; n 2 , ancestral to E. coli and Salmonella enterica; n 3 , ancestral to all enteric bacteria -each representing a different origination time and duration within the gammaproteobacterial lineage leading to E. coli. (See Daubin and Ochman [6] for additional details). We selected genes ranging from approximately 400-800 bp in length and encoding protein products of 15-30 KDa, under the assumption that shorter genes, although conducive to CD spectral analysis, were more likely to represent annotation artifacts. Additionally, the context of genes was taken into consideration: we selected target genes that had different strand orientations and/or combinations of ORFans, HOPs or ancestral genes as neighbors.\n\nTarget genes were amplified from E. coli MG1655 genome using gene-specific primers that incorporated a 5\u2032-tagged recognition site for either NdeI or XhoI. The amplified PCR products were purified using Qiaex II (Qiagen), digested with the appropriate restriction endonucleases (New England Biolabs) and directionally ligated into pET21b expression vector (Novagen) at the NdeI and XhoI sites. This procedure leads to the C-terminal addition of a hexa-histidine tag, which allows purification of the recombinant proteins by Ni 2+ -NTA chromatography. Ligated plasmid constructs were transformed into XL10-Gold \u00ae Ultracompetent cells (Stratagene), and the inserts of selected recombinants were confirmed by sequencing.\n\nTarget proteins were expressed in and purified from E. coli BL21(\u03bbDE3) competent cells (Stratagene). Briefly, transformants were inoculated in 40 ml of Luria-Bertani broth and grown at 37\u00b0C to an OD 600 = 0.5. Cultures were induced by the addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1mM and grown at either 30\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C for 3 hours to allow expression of the target gene. After the induction period, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the resulting pellet was suspended in Buffer A (100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 [pH 8.0], 10 mM Tris, 6 M guanidine hydrochloride) and lysed by mechanical inversion for 1 hour. The lysate was then adjusted to 10 mM imidazole and centrifuged at 12000g for 15 minutes. Clear guanidine lysates were passed through Ni 2+ -NTA columns (Qiagen), which were washed twice with Buffer A supplemented with 10mM imidazole to prevent the non-specific binding of proteins. Target proteins were eluted with 0.6 ml of Buffer F (200 mM acetic acid, 6 M guanidine hydrochloride). The purified proteins were refolded by dialysis into 100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 buffer (pH 7.0) supplemented with 3mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol to reduce the formation of disulphide bonds. Dialyzed proteins were centrifuged at 12000g for 15 minutes to separate soluble protein from precipitates. A minimum of 600 \u03bcl of supernatant fraction containing soluble refolded protein were recovered after renaturation by dialysis for each sample. The amount of soluble refolded protein in the supernatant fractions ranged from 0.03 mg/ml (yabP) to 1.43 mg/ml (paaD). When necessary, proteins were concentrated using centrifugal filters with a cutoff value of 5 kDa (Millipore). Relative amounts of precipitated and soluble protein were assessed by running volume-equalized pellet and supernatant samples on 12% SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie Blue. The concentration of soluble protein was measured on a CARY 50 spectrophotometer. Molar extinction coefficients (\u03b5 280 ) were calculated based on the number of tryptophan residues (5559 cm \u22121 per residue) plus the number of tyrosine residues (1197 cm \u22121 per residue). Soluble protein concentration was then estimated by dividing the A 280 values by the \u03b5 280 extinction coefficient.\n\nFar ultraviolet CD spectra of soluble proteins were obtained with an Olis DSM20 CD spectrop hotometer. Baseline calibrations were generated from the wavelength scans obtained with dialysis buffer (100 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 3 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol). Wavelength scans for each in vivo soluble protein were obtained from an average of three scans at 1 nm increments at 20\u00b0C in a 1 millimeter path length cuvette with an integration time of two seconds. Protein concentrations ranging from 8.0 to 10.3 \u03bcM were used for obtaining CD spectra. Three independent scans were recorded for each protein. Mean residue ellipticity [\u03b8] was calculated as follows: [\u03b8] = \u03b8 \u00d7 100/l \u00d7 n \u00d7 c, where '\u03b8' is ellipticity in millidegrees, 'l' is the cell path length in centimeters, 'n' is the number of amino acids in the protein sequence and 'c' is the millimolar concentration of the protein. Per cent helicity was calculated as % helicity = 100 \u00d7 [(\u03b8 222 + 2,340)/30,300], where '[\u03b8] 222 ' is the mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm [35] . Based on the CD spectra and percent helicity, proteins were characterized as \"significantly alpha-helical\", \"predominantly beta-sheet\" or \"intermediate/ indeterminate\". Representative CD spectra of ORFan and HOP proteins are presented in Figure 1 .\n\nOf 30 ORFan genes initially cloned and expressed, 16 yielded amounts of protein that were detectable on SDS-PAGE gels following denaturing purification and refolding by dialysis. Eight of these proteins precipitated as an insoluble fraction during refolding, whereas others yielded varying levels of soluble protein in supernatant fractions (Table 1 ). In three cases (YdaT from clade n 2 , CrcA from clade n 3 , and DnaT from clade n 3 ), solubility of the expressed protein was higher when induced at 30\u00b0C than at 37\u00b0C (Table 1) . Proteins were recovered from seven of 17 of the more recently originated ORFan genes (those from clades n 0 and n 1 ) vs. nine of 13 ORFans genes from the n 2 and n 3 clades. Three of 17 of the n 0 and n 1 genes yielded soluble refolded proteins, with only two generating amounts sufficient (>8\u03bcM) for further characterization. By contrast, five of 13 of the n 2 and n 3 genes produced sufficient amounts of soluble refolded protein. Thus, a larger proportion of the phylogenetically 'older' ORFans produced adequate yields of soluble refolded proteins in these expression experiments.\n\nOf 24 HOP genes cloned, 15 encoded proteins that yielded detectable amounts of expressed protein following denaturing purification, which is only a slightly larger fraction than observed with ORFan genes (Table 1) . Among the proteins expressed by HOP genes, however, a significantly smaller proportion was insoluble than among those expressed by ORFan genes: only three were insoluble (and these were all from clade n 1 ), three were partially soluble, and nine were soluble upon renaturation. Unlike the ORFans, phylogenetically younger HOP genes, i.e., those from the n 0 and n 1 clades, did not show lower expression levels. However, there were clade-specific differences in refolding behavior: five of 13 of the n 0 and n 1 genes gave some soluble refolded protein, but only four yielded amounts sufficient (>8\u03bcM) for further characterization. By contrast, all seven of the expressed n 2 and n 3 genes gave significant yields of soluble protein (Table 1) . Thus, with the HOPs, as with the ORFans, fewer of the 'younger' genes gave refoldable, soluble proteins.\n\nOverall, of the 54 genes cloned, 31 expressed amounts of protein that were detectable after denaturing nickel affinity chromatography when induced at 30\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C, of these, 13 yielded soluble proteins. For 10 genes (5 ORFans, 5 HOPs), protein production was higher when expression was induced at 30\u00b0C (as opposed to 37\u00b0C), and such enhancements at lower temperatures were observed principally among genes from the older clades, n 2 and n 3 .\n\nThe secondary structure of each of the soluble (or partially soluble) refolded proteins was analyzed by far-UV CD spectroscopy. CD spectra and general structural classifications were obtained for the seven ORFans and 11 HOPs that yielded sufficiently high concentrations (> 8\u03bcM) of soluble protein after renaturation by dialysis ( Table 2 ). All of these proteins appeared to have significant secondary structure content and thus appear to be folded rather than disordered in solution. In particular, all proteins lacked a strong negative signal in the 200-205 region, which would be present in a protein dominated by unfolded, random coil structure. Representative CD spectra for each of the secondary structure category observed for ORFan and HOP proteins are shown in Figure 1 .\n\nBased on their CD spectral curves (Supplementary Figure 1) , three ORFan-encoded proteins, (YbfP, YdaW, and CrcA) were significantly \u03b1-helical, YkfB and DnaT were characterized as \u03b2-sheet proteins, and CsgA and YdaT were of intermediate/indeterminate structure ( Figure 2 ). The percent helicity (i.e., roughly the proportion of helical residues in the protein) in the \u03b1-helical proteins was twice that observed in the predominantly \u03b2-sheet proteins (40% vs. 19%) ( Table 2) .\n\nAmong the HOP proteins for which we obtained CD spectra, a majority were significantly \u03b1-helical, with an average helicity of 38% ( Figure 2 ; Table 2 ). The spectra of the four HOP proteins (YegJ, PaaD, EutP and NrdI) clearly exhibited a fold corresponding to intermediate/ indeterminate structures (Supplementary figure 2) . Only a single HOP protein (AllA) showed a CD spectrum consistent with that of a \u03b2-sheet protein (Figure 2 ), and this protein had lowest helicity (11%) among all proteins tested (Table 2 ).\n\nBecause the functions of most proteins in most genomes are recognized only through sequence or structural similarities to previously characterized proteins, inferring the functions of ORFans (i.e., genome-or lineage-specific proteins), which lack homologs, presents a particular challenge. Although ORFans were originally thought to correspond to the non-functional or poorly annotated regions of a genome, there is growing evidence that these sequences encode functional proteins [34] . In the present study, we applied a multifactorial approach that considered numerous characteristics (gene clonability and expression; protein refoldability, solubility and secondary structure) of ORFans of different ages in the E. coli lineage in order to identify factors that promote their presence and maintenance in bacterial genomes.\n\nThe initial steps in the physical characterization of these proteins rely on the cloning and expression of ORFan genes. Although there are large numbers of genes that cannot be cloned or expressed at high copy-numbers because they are deleterious to their E. coli host [36, 37, 38] , all of the ORFan genes we tested were already constituents of the E. coli MG1655 genome, and the expression of each native locus has been observed under some growth condition. Using quantitative PCR, we verified that several of the ORFan genes generated high levels of mRNA when grown at different conditions. That said, in surveying the conditions that might regulate the expression of ORFan genes, a survey of available microarray data shows that five of the 14 ORFan genes that did not yield proteins never showed differential expression under any condition tested [39, 40] . In contrast, those ORFan genes for which we were able to isolate proteins had a higher probability of being differentially expressed, indicating that they are likely produced (and useful) during some stage of the E. coli life cycle. It should be noted that over half of the ORFan genes examined were induced during adaptation to glucose-limiting conditions [41, 42] . Thus, we were more likely to recover proteins from ORFan genes whose regulation had previously been shown to be modulated by some environmental variable.\n\nBecause bacterial genes are often arranged in operons, gene context -i.e., the order and orientation of adjacent genes -can also influence patterns of gene expression. We examined the nearest neighbors of each of the cloned ORFan genes with the thought that ORFans that reside next to and transcribed in the same strand orientation as an ancestral gene would be more likely to produce stable proteins because they do not require their own promoter to drive transcription. Neither the ancestry of adjacent genes nor the orientation of an ORFan gene relative to its neighbors provided clues about our ability to isolate protein from a particular gene. Those ORFans situated immediately downstream of ancestral genes were as likely as not to produce proteins in our system; and although most ORFan genes were aligned in the same orientation as their upstream genes, in three of the eight cases where they were in opposite direction, we were able to recover proteins for structural analysis ( Table 1 ).\n\nOnly about 60% of the ORFans and HOPs tested in our study displayed detectable levels of protein after overexpression from the pET21b vector grown in E. coli BL21 (DE3). However, Yee et al. [43] using a similar expression system, found that nearly 80% of the E. coli native proteins of under 23 kDa (and which lacked predicted transmembrane domains) could be expressed. Thus, the expression of ORFan genes, as a group, may differ substantially from the rest of the genome, and the difference in expressability may be attributable to the fact that (i) the genes in our study were chosen without regard to their status as membrane proteins, (ii) the unusual base compositions of ORFans genes might result in an increased high metabolic cost to the host, and (iii) some ORFan proteins could not be extracted by traditional lysis procedures (6M guanidine).\n\nAlthough we have no information about their in vivo solubility, 58% of the expressed ORFan and HOP proteins could be refolded into a soluble form by dialysis out of guanidine, similar to that obtained in a previous study that reported that about 55% of the in vivo insoluble proteins in the size range of 6-18 kDa could be refolded successfully out of guanidine (in contrast to soluble proteins in which nearly 90% of could be refolded) [44] . Because larger proteins are more difficult to refold, the overall lower rate of refolding success of ORFan and HOP proteins (58% in the present study vs. 55-88% observed by Maxwell et al. [44] ) might be attributable to differences in the size class of the proteins tested (15-30 kDa vs. 6-18 kDa, respectively).\n\nThe ORFans and HOPs which were refoldable and had significant secondary structure content seem likely to represent functional proteins. It must also be noted, however, that expressed proteins which fail to refold in a soluble form from denaturant solutions may also be perfectly functional in vivo. First, some proteins that are insoluble in physiological buffers may be associated with cell membranes and in the two cases for which functions have been assigned to ORFan genes producing insoluble proteins, one (yafO) encodes a toxin, and the other (ompX) encodes an outer member protein implicated in adhesion and virulence [45, 46, 47] . Second, some proteins may be soluble in their native form, but undergo nonnative aggregation and precipitation in competition with correct refolding during dialysis from guanidine. Failure of soluble proteins to refold correctly in vitro may be due to the absence of protein folding modulators, such as chaperones and proteases, that may be necessary to ensure proper folding, stabilization and solubilization in vivo [48, 49, 50, 51] . In short, refoldability is one observation in favor of a protein being functional, but it is by no means a necessary precondition.\n\nIt is also likely that some of proteins that were insoluble by our procedures are soluble in their native state but undergo precipitation in competition with correct refolding during dialysis. Ventura and Villaverde [52] reported that inclusion bodies often contain wellfolded and biologically active proteins, and studies on beta-galactosidase of E. coli [53] and endoglucanase D of Clostridium thermocellum [54] detected active proteins in inclusion bodies, further suggesting that protein solubility may be due to the conditions used for protein extraction and refolding, but not the functional quality, of the expressed protein.\n\nThe majority of soluble and refolded ORFan and HOP proteins yielded CD spectra indicative of significant secondary structure content, with a prevalence of \u03b1-helical structures. A previous study focusing on insoluble hypothetical proteins from Thermotoga maritima and Saccharomyces cerevisiae reported that approximately 50% of the proteins with well-resolved CD spectra corresponded to an \u03b1-helical structure, whereas only 9-25% corresponded to \u03b2-sheet configurations [44] . A broad survey of the SP175 CD spectra reference database (http://pcddb.cryst.bbk.ac.uk) showed that proteins with \u03b2-sheet structures are twice as common as \u03b1-helical proteins [55] . However, Wolf et al. [56] and Hegyi et al. [57] note that \u03b2-sheet proteins are most commonly involved in regulation and signal transduction, and are generally more highly abundant in eukaryotes than in bacteria. Thus, the dearth of predominantly \u03b2-sheet protein structures in our study could be attributable to the size class of proteins that we investigated, the emphasis of the present study on prokaryotic proteins, and even an increased probability for \u03b1-helical proteins to refold from guanidine [58] . It should also be noted that some of the proteins classed as \u03b1helical in our study may also contain substantial \u03b2-sheet structure that is masked by the helical signal, which tends to dominate the spectrum. For example, protein YbiA (categorized as significantly \u03b1-helical in our study) for which the NMR structure has been solved (PDB code: 2B3W), has some \u03b2-sheet though it is mainly dominated by \u03b1-helix structure. Furthermore, our CD spectral observation on protein AllA (predominantly \u03b2sheet) correlated with crystallographic studies which revealed the protein to be of \u03b2-sheet structure [59] .\n\nAmong those ORFans for which we were able to isolate proteins, there is an association between the age (i.e., phylogenetic distribution) of a gene and its ability to refold out of guanidine. Previous microarray studies assessing gene expression levels under various growth conditions revealed that about half of our cloned ORFan genes selected from younger clades (n 0 and n 1 ) were transcriptionally variable as compared to 92% from older clades (n 2 and n 3 ) [39, 40, 41, 42] .\n\nIt was much more common for older ORFans to yield substantial amounts of soluble refolded protein with highly resolved CD spectra when compared to the proteins encoded by younger ORFans. This presence of folded ORFan proteins with significant secondary structure in deeper clades is perhaps not surprising given that non-functional genes are eventually lost from bacterial genomes [60, 61] . However, the preponderance of well-folded proteins among the older ORFans indicates that genes that encode proteins with well-folded (as opposed to unfolded) structures are more likely to be functional and retained.\n\nThough the sources of ORFans remain obscure, most are likely to be of viral origin [8] . To determine if ORFans differ from other classes of acquired genes, we also examined the same features in genes acquired from distantly related species, with the thought that many of these sequences (termed HOPs) were already functioning in another bacterial genome prior to their arrival in E. coli. As a class, HOPs encode longer proteins (Daubin and Ochman [6] ), but in the present study, we selected HOPs that averaged approximately the same length as ORFans.\n\nWe were able to obtain proteins for 63% of the 24 HOP genes cloned, but only 13% resulted in insoluble fractions, about half of that observed for ORFans. In addition, recovery of soluble and partially soluble HOP proteins for structural studies was much higher (73% vs. 44%). But for most of the other features that we tested, HOPs resembled ORFans. Like ORFans, gene context and orientation had no apparent affect on the expression of cloned HOPs. Furthermore, of the HOP proteins for which the CD spectra were obtained, the majority were from older clades (n 2 and n 3 ). Finally, structural analysis revealed that approximately half of the HOP proteins that yielded CD spectra had significant amounts of \u03b1-helical structure, which agrees with that observed for ORFan proteins and for proteins of this size class in general [44] .\n\nIn summary, we examined and determined the expression, solubility, refolding ability and secondary structure of ORFan and HOP genes present in E. coli MG1655 genome. Of the total of 54 genes cloned, nearly 60% could be expressed and 18 produced refoldable, soluble proteins that yielded CD spectra resembling structures of folded proteins. Our data support the notion that many ORFans are indeed real genes and encode folded and probably functional proteins, despite their lack of clear conserved homologs. A recent study focusing on the poorly conserved paralogs in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 found that nearly 80% of the genes tested were transcriptionally active, indicating that these genes might encode true proteins [18] . Interestingly, it seems that many ORFans, even those that have persisted for long evolutionary time spans, are likely to encode proteins that have truly novel folded structures with unique functions or to correspond to rapidly evolving known protein folds of similar functions [5, 62] . Large scale initiatives aimed at revealing the structure and function of proteins present in Mycoplasma have not only assigned structure-based functions for the majority of the hypothetical proteins but also revealed that nearly 50% of the ORFans tested had unique folds [63] .\n\nRecent studies focusing on proteins encoded by the SARS coronavirus revealed that 50% of the proteins for which the structure have been resolved had distinct and novel folds [64] . And one such protein, nsp1, which is presumed to be involved in mRNA degradation, was shown to have an irregular \u03b2-barrel fold that was previously unknown among proteins involved in this biological function [65] . Thus, it could be that ORFans also have a role in basic cellular processes but perform these functions by unique mechanisms. Although it is not possible to define and characterize new structures based solely on CD spectral analysis, future studies focusing on NMR and X-ray crystallography of ORFan proteins, in association with these resolved spectra, can potentially yield distinctive novel folds.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
