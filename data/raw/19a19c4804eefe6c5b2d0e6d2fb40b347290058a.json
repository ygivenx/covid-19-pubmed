{"title": "Supplemental Information The Intergenic Recombinant HLA-B*46:01 Has a Distinctive Peptidome that Includes KIR2DL3 Ligands", "body": "(C) Analysis of the conserved residues at positions 2 and 9 and 3 and 9 in peptides bound by HLA-C*01:02. Shown is the identity and frequency of amino acids found at position 9 when alanine is present at position 2 (upper panel) or when proline is at position 3 (lower panel). 10 9 14 10 9 11 10 10 9 9 9 9 9 9 10 9 10 16 9 17 11 10 13 18 14 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 10 9 9 10 12 10 9 9 14 11 10 20 9 8 16 9 9 9 9 15 10 9 10 9 17 9 11 9 14 11 12 9 9 10 9 9 9 10 18 10 18 25 21 10 9 10 17 9 9 9 9 9 4.0 7. were made with web-based NetMHC 4.0 server (re-trained on the data included in this study) (Nielsen et al., 2003) .\n\n(B) Shown is a representative gating strategy for defining CD107a expression in live KIR2DL3+/KIR3DL1-NK cells. Natural killer cells were isolated from five healthy KIR A haplotype and HLA-C1 homozygous donors by magnetic separation. Cells were analyzed on an LSR II cytometer (BD Biosciences) at the Stanford Flow Cytometry Core Facility.\n\nIsolation and analysis of peptide ligands was performed as previously described Trolle et al., 2016; Yaciuk et al., 2014) . Bound peptides were dissociated from class I heavy and light chains by denaturation in 10% acetic acid for 15min at 75\u00b0C. Peptides were separated from the denatured proteins by passage through a stirred cell ultrafiltration device (3-kDa-cutoff membrane [Millipore] ). The filtrate containing peptides was lyophilized, re-suspended in 10% acetic acid and separated into ~40 fractions by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described . Each fraction was dried and re-suspended in 10% acetic acid for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Approximately 25% of each HPLC fraction was injected into a nano-scale reverse phase liquid chromatography Eksigent nano-LC-4000 (Sciex)\n\nsystem. Column specifications, mobile phase solvents, and the elution gradient were as described . Eluted fractions were ionized using a NanoSpray III (Sicex) ion source into a Sciex TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer.\n\nFor the large-scale de novo identification of peptide ligands >10mg of purified sHLA were used.\n\nSpectra were acquired in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. The DDA spectra were collected for each of the off-line HPLC fractions for each HLA allotype separately. For each HLA allotype, the off-line fractions were combined in silico and interpreted using PEAKS 7.0 (Bioinformatic Solutions). Spectra were searched against the Uniprot Homo sapiens database.\n\nAll sequence assignments were made following a 1% false-discovery rate and precursor ions were within 50 ppm of the theoretical mass. A maximum of two variable modifications per peptide were allowed and these included: N-terminal acetylation, deamidation (Asn, Gln), oxidation (Met, Trp, His), pyro-glu from Gln, cysteinylation (Cys), sodium adduct (C-term, Asp, Glu). Peptides originating from HLA heavy and light chains were removed from the ligand list as they are known acid hydrolysis products. E.coli (EMD Millipore) and plated onto selective agar (50\u00b5g/ml kanamycin). For each construct, a 1L 2XYT culture (1.6% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl) with 50\u00b5g/ml kanamycin was inoculated with a single colony, expanded to an optical density at 600nm of 0.7 and protein production induced with addition of isopropyl \u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Life Technologies) to a final concentration of 0.5mM. The culture was incubated, shaking at 37\u00b0C for 6h following which cells were harvested by centrifugation. NK cell cytotoxicity assay using T2 cell lines"}
