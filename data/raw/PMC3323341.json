{"title": "Model Parameters and Outbreak Control for SARS", "body": "The basic reproductive number (R0) is the average number of secondary cases generated by a primary case. If R0 < 1, an epidemic can not be sustained. On the other hand, if R0 > 1, an epidemic typically occurs.\n\nThe basic reproductive number derived from our model (10) is given by the formula\n\nThis equation includes 10 parameters of which 2, the diagnostic rate (\u03b1) and the relative infectiousness during isolation (l), are widely recognized as being amenable to modification by medical intervention. The transmission rate (\u03b2) is defined as the number of persons infected per infectious person per day. This differs from R0, which is the average number of secondary cases that an infectious person generates when introduced into a susceptible population. Definitions for the remaining parameters are provided in Table 1.\n\nBaseline values for k, \u03b32, \u03b4, and \u03b1 are taken from the mean values estimated in reference 3. Because whether asymptomatic persons (exposed class) can transmit the disease is not known, we have fixed q = 0.1 (the relative infectiousness of exposed, asymptomatic persons) as in reference 10.\n\nThe model parameters \u0398 = (\u03b2, l) are fitted to Hong Kong data (2) by least squares fit to the cumulative number of cases C (t, \u0398) (equation 1 in reference 10). All other parameters are fixed to their baseline values (Table 1). We used a computer program (Berkeley Madonna, R.I. Macey and G.F. Foster, Berkeley, CA) and appropriate initial conditions for the parameters for the optimization process, which was repeated 10 times (each time the program is fed with two different initial conditions for each parameter) before the \"best fit\" was chosen. The best fit gives \u03b2 = 0.25 and l = 0.43. We also estimated the relative infectiousness after isolation (l) for the case of Singapore (l = 0.49) by following the least squares procedure described above. However, for the case of Toronto, not enough data were available on the initial growth of the outbreak. Hence, we only estimated l from Toronto data after control measures were put in place on March 26 (10,11), where l = 0.1. We used the transmission rate (\u03b2) obtained from Hong Kong data as the baseline value (Table 1).\n\nWe revised earlier estimates for \u03c1 and p (10) (both affect R0) using data from the age distribution of residents and the age-specific incidence of SARS in Hong Kong, as reported (3). The revised estimates are \u03c1 = 0.77 (the initial proportion of the population at higher risk) and p = 1/3 (the measure of reduced susceptibility in S2). The lower-risk subpopulation lies in the age range <19. It constitutes approximately 23% of Hong Kong's population (3). The fact that most of the SARS cases included in the epidemiologic studies of the Toronto outbreak (5) were transmitted in hospitals limits the use of general demographic data from Toronto in the estimation of \u03c1 and p. Hence, we used the parameters estimated from the situation in Hong Kong. Baseline values for all the parameters are given in Table 1.\n\nWe carried out an uncertainty analysis on the basic reproductive number (R0) to assess the variability in R0 that results from the uncertainty in the model parameters. We used a Monte Carlo procedure (simple random sampling) to quantify the uncertainty of R0 to model parameters when these parameters are distributed. Similar methods have been used before (12\u201314). Parameters (k, \u03b32, \u03b4, \u03b1) were assigned a different probability density function (PDF) (Figure 1), which is taken from reference 3. The relative measure of infectiousness of persons after isolation procedures are put in place (l) was assumed to be uniformly distributed in the interval (0 < l < 1). The observed heterogeneity in transmission rates during the SARS epidemic is modeled here by assuming that \u03b2 is distributed exponentially with mean 0.25 person\u20131 day\u20131 (our estimate of the transmission rate in Hong Kong). Parameters q, p, and \u03c1 are fixed to their baseline values (Table 1). We sampled the set of six parameters (\u03b2, k, \u03b32, \u03b4, \u03b1, l) 105 times, holding q, p, and \u03c1 fixed. We then computed R0 from each set. A probability density function for R0 is obtained and can be statistically characterized. Here, we characterize R0 by its median and interquartile range.\n\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis on R0 to quantify the effect of changes in the model parameters on R0. Hence, we rank model parameters according to the size of their effect on R0. Partial rank correlation coefficients (12\u201315) were computed between each of the parameters (with the exception of p, q, and \u03c1, which were held fixed) and R0 as samples were drawn from the distributions, thus quantifying the strength of the parameter's linear association with R0. The larger the partial rank correlation coefficient, the larger the influence of the input parameter on the magnitude of R0. Because the distribution of the parameter l (relative infectiousness after isolation) is not known, we also studied the sensitivity of R0 to various distributions of l. Distributions of l used for the Monte Carlo calculation of the partial rank correlation coefficients are: a) l ~ \u03b2 (a = 2, b = 2) where \u03b2 is used to denote a beta distribution. Here, the likelihood of l is bell-shaped with mean 0.5 and variance 0.05; b) l ~ \u03b2 (a = 1, b = 2), the likelihood of l decreases linearly in the [0,1] interval; and c) l ~ \u03b2 (a = 2, b = 1), the likelihood of l increases linearly in the [0,1] interval.\n\nThe resulting R0 distribution lies in the interquartile range 0.43\u20132.41, with a median of 1.10. Moreover, the probability that R0 > 1 is 0.53. The same Monte Carlo procedure, but with fixed values of l = 0.1 and \u03b1 = 1/3 day\u20131 for Toronto (i.e., after implementing control measures on March 26), give a median and interquartile range for the distribution of R0 = 0.58 (0.24\u20131.18) (Table 2). Similarly, a lower rate of diagnosis a = 1/4.85 day\u20131 and the relative infectiousness after isolation in Hong Kong (l = 0.43) and Singapore (l = 0.49) gives R0 = 1.10 (0.44\u20132.29) and 1.17 (0.47\u20132.47), respectively (Figure 2). Perfect isolation (l = 0) gives R0 = 0.49 (0.19\u20131.08). Especially noteworthy is that even in cases when eventual control of an outbreak is achieved (Toronto and a hypothetical case of perfect isolation), 25% of the weight of the distribution of R0 lies at R0 > 1. Furthermore, the median and interquartile range of R0 are larger when p = 1, as has been assumed (8). In Figure 3 we show the (\u03b2, l) parameter space when R0 < 1 obtained from our uncertainty analysis (14).\n\nThe transmission rate \u03b2 and the relative infectivity during isolation (l) are the most influential parameters in determining R0. The systematic decline in R0 with increasing l in the range [0,1] is illustrated in Figure 4. Furthermore, our results do not change if we assume the three distributions mentioned in the Methods section (sensitivity analysis) for the parameter l. Table 3 shows the partial rank correlation coefficients for the other three possible distributions of l. The transmission rate is ranked first independent of the distribution of l. The relative infectiousness after isolation is ranked second when l comes from distributions (a) and (b) and ranked third when it comes from distribution (c) (see Methods). Our sensitivity analysis is corroborated by computing local derivatives on R0 (see Appendix). Because bounds exist on how much a given parameter can change in practice, achieving control (i.e., R0 < 1) can require changing parameters other than those with the highest partial rank correlation coefficient. For example, reference 10 showed that control of the outbreak in Toronto relied on both a reduction in l and 1/\u03b1, even though \u03b1 is ranked fairly low by the partial rank correlation coefficient.\n\nWe have estimated R0 for the cases of Toronto, Hong Kong, and Singapore (Table 2) through an uncertainty analysis shown in equation 1. Our estimates for R0 agree with the empirical R0 observed from the data of the first week of the SARS outbreak in Singapore (8). A stretched exponential distribution fits the resulting distributions of R0 for the different locations (Figure 2). Even though the median of R0 is <1 when perfect patient isolation is assumed (l = 0), we find that 25% of our R0 distribution lies at R0 > 1. That is, implementing a single method for control may not be sufficient to contain a SARS outbreak. Control may require modifying more than one parameter amenable to intervention. In our model, these parameters include the diagnostic rate (\u03b1), the relative infectiousness after isolation has begun (l), and the per capita transmission rate (\u03b2). The fact that \u03b1 and l are not independent, but are tightly coupled, favors control.\n\nOur expression for R0 incorporates the effects of diagnosis-isolation strategies. Moreover, our approach includes differential susceptibility (p) and effective population size (\u03c1). Most models take p = 1, even though data from Hong Kong show that a low-risk subpopulation lies in the age range <19, approximately 23% of Hong Kong's population (3). The assumption p = 1 thus overestimates R0.\n\nOur sensitivity analysis shows that the transmission rate (\u03b2) and the relative infectiousness after isolation in hospitals (l) have the largest effect on R0. With the exception of a few measures, such as closing schools, no clear policies would modify \u03b2 directly. This means that a substantial effort must be (and has been) made by the medical community to modify other parameters, such as the diagnostic rate. Hence, the strong sensitivity of R0 to the transmission rate \u03b2 indicates that efforts in finding intervention strategies that manage to systematically lower the contact rate of persons of all age groups promise an effective means for lowering R0. Such strategies may include using face masks (the probability of transmission per contact may be reduced), washing hands, and avoiding large crowds (large public events).\n\nAssociated with the role of screening, diagnosis, and the effective isolation of patients is the issue of cost. We cannot ignore or minimize the value of stringent quarantine measures and the probability of compliance combined with the economic effect of lost wages (thousands were quarantined in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore [17]), the costs associated with screening at airports and hospitals, the cost associated with closing hospitals; and the costs associated with isolating SARS patients and exposed persons (see Appendix for a brief discussion).\n\nThe sensitivity analysis approach through an exhaustive sampling of the parameter space provides a global measure of the sensitivity of model parameters. Another approach is to compute the sensitivity indices of the model parameters through local derivatives (18). This approach only provides a local measure as the sensitivity indices can change when the parameter values change. Here, we use local sensitivity analysis to corroborate our global sensitivity analysis results and discuss how this approach can be applied in the analysis of cost as part of a policy of outbreak control.\n\nLet \u03bb represent any of the 10 nonnegative parameters, \u03b2, \u03c1, p, q, k, \u03b31, \u03b3 2, \u03b4, \u03b1, and l, that define the basic reproductive number of our model (19)\n\nIf a \"small\" perturbation \u03b4\u03bb is made to the parameter \u03bb, a corresponding change will occur in R0 as \u03b4R0, where\n\nThe normalized sensitivity index \u03a8\u03bb is the ratio of the corresponding normalized changes and is defined as\n\nAn approximation of the perturbed value of R0, in terms of the sensitivity index is\n\nwhere the 10 normalized sensitivity indexes are\n\nwith \u03b7 = p(1\u2013\u03c1)+\u03c1 and \u03b32 = a \u03b31/( \u03b1 \u2013\u03b31). For the values of the parameters used in this model, the sensitivity indices \u03a8\u03b2, \u03a8\u03c1, \u03a8p, \u03a8q, and \u03a8l are positive, \u03a8k = \u2013\u03a8q, and the remaining indexes are negative. Furthermore, since all of the indexes (except \u03a8\u03b2) are functions of the parameters, the sensitivity indexes will change as the parameter values change.\n\nFor our specific case where \u03b2 = 0.25, q = 0.1, p = 1/3, k = 0.15707, \u03b1 = 0.2061, \u03b31 = 0.035285, \u03b32 = 0.0426, \u03b4 = 0.0279, and \u03c1 = 0.77 and Toronto (l = 0.1) or Hong Kong (l = 0.43), the normalized sensitivity indices are computed. The sensitivity indices and the associated percentage changes needed to affect a 1% decrease in R0 are given in Tables A1 and A2. Since the effective rate of patient isolation and the average rate of diagnosis are two feasible intervention strategies, we examine how changes to the parameters l and \u03b1 affect R0.\n\nLet us first consider the outbreak in Hong Kong. The value \u03b1 = 0.2061 means that the mean time to diagnose an infected person's illness is approximately 4.85 days. The sensitivity index \u03a8\u03b1 = \u20130.1933 means that a 5.2% increase in \u03b1, which in turn requires a decrease of 5.7 hours of mean time to diagnosis, would result in a decrease of approximately 1% in R0. Similarly, the sensitivity index \u03a8l = 0.5183 suggests that a 1.9% decrease in the value of l, that is going from 0.43 to 0.42 isolation effectiveness,2 results in a 1% decrease in R0. In other words, individually a 5.2% increase in a or a 1.9% decrease in l both result in approximately a 1% decrease in R0. For the particular values of the parameters chosen for Hong Kong, the most effective way to reduce R0 is to decrease the transmission rate \u03b2 and the parameter l (improve the effective isolation rate). In the case of Toronto, \u03a8\u03b1 = \u20130.4758 means that a 2.1% increase in \u03b1, results in a 1% decrease in R0, whereas \u03a8l = 0.2001 means a 5% decrease in l also results in a 1% decrease in R0.\n\nAs can be seen from these two examples, the importance or ranking of the sensitivity indices can change as the values of the parameters change. Specifically, the sensitivity indices \u03a8l and \u03a8\u03b1 satisfy the relationship\n\nFor the particular values of the parameters given above, the Figure A1 shows the level curve for the pair (l,\u03b1), where l(\u03b1+2\u03b31+2\u03b4) = \u03b4+\u03b32. The particular parameter values are either for Toronto (l,\u03b1) = (0.1, 0.2064) or for Hong Kong (l,\u03b1) = (0.43, 0.2064). Choosing the parameter values (l,\u03b1) below the level curve means that ||\u03a8l|| < ||\u03a8\u03b1||and the converse is true if (l,\u03b1) is chosen above the curve. Along the level curve, the magnitude of the sensitivities is equal. Notice that the level curve divides the parameter space into two regions, each of area Aabove and Abelow, respectively. Since Aabove >> Abelow, \u03a8l will be the dominant sensitivity index for randomly chosen (l,\u03b1).\n\nOne aspect of implementing an efficient intervention policy is the fact that limited resources are available. If one assumes, for example, that the strategies of isolation and diagnosis have associated 1% incremental costs in implementation of \u03b4CI and \u03b4CD, respectively, then a mixed strategy should be formulated that maximizes the effectiveness of a combined intervention. Specifically, if x denotes the magnitude of percentage decrease in l, and y denotes the % increase in a and assuming that there is a maximum amount of total additional resources available (\u03b4CT), then the total additional cost of a new mixed isolation and diagnosis intervention policy must satisfy the inequality \u03b4CIx+\u03b4CDy < \u03b4CT. Since the objective is to maximize the decrease in R0, this means we want to maximize the objective function P = ||\u03a8l||x+||\u03a8\u03b1||y under the appropriate constraints. In a more general setting, additional nonlinear constraints could be involved, which case would require one to solve a nonlinear optimization problem. The situation in which the cost of diagnosis of infected persons may be much greater than the cost of isolation or vice versa is certainly of interest."}
