{"title": "Anti-biofilm Activity of Graphene Quantum Dots via Self-Assembly with Bacterial Amyloid Proteins", "body": "Most microorganisms survive in the form of biofilms -structurally and functionally sophisticated microbial communities. Biofilms are implicated in numerous technological problems from water membrane failures to airplane crashes 1,2 as well as in various diseases from persistent infections to cancer 3, 4 . Biofilms also form a large component of the ecosphere on Earth and their dysregulation can also cause significant ecological consequences. 5 Biofilms act like multicellular organisms and possess exceptional adaptability and resilience to environmental factors and pharmaceuticals. 6, 7 Both of these properties are afforded by the protective function of extracellular matrix (ECM), which is made from several types of biomolecules (i.e., polysaccharides, DNA, and peptides). 8, 9 To date only a few classes of compounds have been shown to be effective anti-biofilm agents. 10, 11 Peptides rich in amino acids such as proline, arginine, phenylalanine or tryptophan have shown broad-spectrum activity in killing bacteria within biofilms by targeting a universal stringent stress response in bacteria. 12 However, they are currently being developed only as antibiotic adjuvants because they are subject to rapid proteolytic degradation and are relatively expensive to synthesize. Small molecules have been used to inhibit the quorum sensing (QS) system 13 or interfere with the polymerization of amyloid proteins. 14 While further exploration of these strategies of biofilm inhibition need to be explored, the rapid loss of the small molecules due to diffusion into environment reduce their efficacy and increase their environmental toxicity.\n\nThese problems with the design of effective anti-biofilm agents prompted us to search for new materials platforms. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are a single layer graphene a few nanometers in diameter. They are often regarded as biocompatible alternatives of II-VI semiconductor NPs also known as quantum dots (QDs). 15 GQDs have been investigated for antibacterial activity due to reactive oxygen species production and membrane disruption. [16] [17] [18] While these functionalities highlight the significance of GQDs as a part of microbiology toolbox, we hypothesize that these nanoscale particles can interfere with the self-assembly processes of biomolecular components of the biofilms. Representing the common tendency of nanoscale particles to self-assemble, this hypothesis is grounded in the multiple observations of GQDs and other NPs to specifically interact and assemble with other nanoscale particles and biomolecules. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] As applied to biofilms, GQDs can form 'decoy' complexes with the key structural components of ECM, thereby inhibiting the biofilm formation. Recently this functionality was confirmed by observation of GQDs acting as inhibitors of fibrillation of the protein characteristic for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. [28] [29] [30] [31] Counteracting known problems of other anti-biofilm agents mentioned above, GQDs have high molecular weight (10 3 to 10 5 g/mol) that slows diffusion and are resistant to proteolytic degradation.\n\nAs an experimental model to study the anti-biofilm effects of GQDs, we used biofilms of Staphylococcus aureus --a major cause of hospital-and community-associated bacterial infections in the U.S. and around the world. 32 Formation of S. aureus biofilms on host tissues and implanted medical devices contributes to chronic infections, as biofilms are known to be exceptionally resistant to host immune response and tolerant to antibiotics. 36 The formation and dispersion of staphylococcal biofilms is dependent on the secretion of the phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) [32] [33] [34] --small \u03b1-helical amphipathic peptides that have previously been implicated in bacterial virulence. 35, 36 Assembly of PSMs into fibers 35 promotes the maturation of ECM, 32,37,38 whose integrity renders these bacterial communities resistant to dispersal by proteinase K, Dispersin B, DNase and sodium dodecyl sulfate. 32 The self-assembly process of PSMs into amyloid-like fibers involves backbone hydrogen bonding and side-chain interaction (e.g., hydrophobic interaction, \u03c0-stacking, and van der Waals All rights reserved.

Computer simulations indicate that GQD docks at the N-terminal of PSM peptides via carboxyl edge-group and alters the PSM conformation.\n\nGQDs used in this study had a diameter of 2-8 nm 15 and carried nine carboxyl edge-groups on average. (Figure S1 ) To investigate how GQDs affect amyloid-rich biofilms, S. aureus biofilms were grown in peptone-NaCl-glucose (PNG) media for four days in flow cells. 32 S. aureus biofilms were also grown in tryptic soy broth supplemented with glucose (TSBG) media that inhibits amyloid synthesis as a negative control. Confocal images showed that S. aureus formed biofilm covering the entire surface of the flow cell in both TSBG and PNG without GQDs (Figure 1a, d) .\n\nIn the presence of 50 \u03bcg/mL GQDs, the biofilm grown on PNG was largely dispersed whereas the biofilm on TSBG retained its structure (Figure 1b, e) . A further dispersion of biofilm structure occurred in the presence of 500 \u03bcg/mL GQDs in PNG condition, while TSBG biofilm remaining fully present (Figure 1c, f) . According to quantitative image analysis, porosity of the PNG biofilm ( Figure 1g ) increased from 29.4 \u00b1 8.8% to 50.7 \u00b1 6.9% when cultured with 50 \u03bcg/mL GQDs; the porosity further increased to 63.4 \u00b1 5.0% for 500 \u03bcg/mL GQDs. The thickness of the PNG biofilm ( Figure 1h ) decreased from 21.9 \u00b1 2.5 \u03bcm to 16.9 \u00b1 3.4 \u03bcm when cultured with 50 \u03bcg/mL GQDs; the thickness further decreased to 12.7 \u00b1 3.4 \u03bcm with 500 \u03bcg/mL GQDs. The thickness for biofilms grown in TSBG media showed limited change with addition of any dose of GQDs ( Figure S2 ). All rights reserved.

Here the change in porosity of the PNG biofilm is even more distinct than that in confocal microscopy, which increased to 71.2 \u00b1 6.6 % (Figure 1k) . This is likely a result of dehydration process required for SEM sample preparation, which washed off weakly attached bacterial cells and loose ECM content. The phenomenon not only confirmed the increase of biofilm porosity after GQD treatment but also indicated reduced integrity of remaining biomass.\n\nOf note, the growth rate of planktonic S. aureus did not differ significantly with or without GQDs up to 200 \u03bcg/mL ( Figure S3 ). This observation indicates that the GQDs are not toxic to the individual bacteria cells per se, and thus the biofilm dispersal is associated with change in ECM integrity only. Furthermore, the specificity for the GQD effect on PNG grown biofilm versus the TSBG biofilm suggests that amyloid is the unique target of GQDs among other components of the ECM.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The fibers, with a diameter of about 12 nm, were closely associated with bacterial cells and surrounding ECM; their dimensions are comparable to those observed in prior studies 32 (Figure 2a) . ECM was extracted from the biofilm cultures and further analyzed with respect to the effect of GQDs on ECM morphology. In general, various components from ECM may closely combine with the amyloid-fibril core (Figure 2a, b) , which may contain PSM peptides, extracellular DNA and polysaccharide intercellular adhesion (PIA). The GQDs, with concentration of 50 \u00b5g/mL, dramatically altered the morphology and integrity (Figure 2c ).\n\nCircular dichroism (CD) spectrometry was used to obtain complementary information about the secondary structure of the amyloid fibrils. A wide negative peak between 200 nm to 230 nm observed in the CD spectrum (Figure 2d ) is characteristic of amyloid-like fibrils including typical \u03b2-sheet signals at negative at 218 nm and \u03b1-helix negative bands at 208 nm and 222 nm. The negative CD peak at \u2248245 nm is associated with extracellular DNA. 41 All peaks between 200 nm to 250 nm were significantly decreased after two-hour incubation with GQDs suggesting that GQDs cause disruption of the fibril composite structure of extracted biofilm ECM within this timeframe.\n\nAll rights reserved.

The delayed fibrillation for four days suggested that the kinetics of fibril formation changed in presence of GQDs which matches the expectations of the formation of 'decoy' complexes. Similarly to NPs, 42 these supramolecular structures affect the secondary structure of peptides that serve as nucleation centers for fibrillation. Thus, binding of GQDs to PSM monomers or small prefibrillar oligomers is likely to hinder the formation of critical nuclei and elongation of the fibrils.\n\nAll rights reserved.

As previously observed, there are two stages of conformational and morphological changes of peptide aggregation for PSM amyloid-like fibrils. Initially, the freshly dissolved PSM\u03b11 peptides mainly contain \u03b1-helixes. 43 The typical \u03b2-sheet signal with a negative band at \u2248 218 nm, 37 appears after four days for PSM\u03b11 without GQDs (Figure 4a) . This suggested that formation of amyloid fibrils, which agreed with the result of ThT staining ( Figure S4) . Interestingly, secondary structures of PSM\u03b11 incubated with GQDs showed enhancement of \u03b2-turns signal with a positive band at \u2248208nm, in agreement with the theoretical peak of pure \u03b2-turns signal. 44, 45 Meanwhile, a broad peak from 250 nm and 375 nm was observed, corresponding to the absorption of GQDs onto peptide ( Figure S5) and associated with the deformed (coiled) conformation of the graphene sheet. 15 The combination of these two positive CD peaks of PSM\u03b11 induced by GQDs in the All rights reserved.

Subsequently, the negative band at \u2248 218 nm of \u03b2-sheet was enhanced in PSM\u03b11 self-assembling without GQDs after a nine-day incubation, which agrees with the significant increase in ThT fluorescence emission (Figure 4b, S4 ). The change of CD peak in PSM\u03b11 control from Day 4 to Day 9 indicated the transition from lag phase of individual peptides and oligomer to fibril formation 42 . Fibrillation of PSM\u03b11 incubated with GQDs was inhibited when the molar ratio of peptides and GQDs are equal or more than 1:1 (GQD concentration at 200 \u03bcg/mL). However, the fibrillation CD signal of PSM\u03b11 was further interrupted when incubated with excess amount of GQDs (800 \u03bcg/mL) on both Day 4 and 9 (Figure 4 a, b) .\n\nTo confirm the change of secondary structure in protein, we monitored PSM\u03b11 fibrillation with or without GQDs using attenuated total reflectance -Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) (Figure 4c, d) . Deconvolution of the absorbance spectra in the amide I region 46 is indicative of the individual secondary structure components and their relative contribution to the main signal. PSM\u03b11 peptides incubated with or without addition of GQDs for four days display common bands both at \u2248 1655 cm -1 and \u2248 1677 cm \u22121 . The peak at 1655 cm -1 corresponds to \u03b1-helix which appears between 1650 cm -1 and 1657cm -1 and overlapped with turns between 1655 cm \u22121 and 1675 cm \u22121 . The latter is attributed to the weak peak of antiparallel \u03b2-sheet structure 1670-1690 cm -1 . With addition of GQDs, antiparallel \u03b2-sheet were significantly decreased and indicated the inhibition of amyloid fibrillation at early stage of fibril growth. Meanwhile, the band at \u2248 1655 cm \u22121 right-shifted and became narrower, which verified the slight changes from \u03b1-helix to \u03b2-turns in PSM\u03b11 dispersion. After 9 days, the \u03b1-helix peak decreased in all samples. At the same time, All rights reserved.

PSM\u03b11 peptide contains 21 amino acids and consist of a single amphipathic helix with a slight bend near the N-and C-terminal (Figure 5a) . 47 (Figure 5c) , which is consistent with the enhanced CD signal of \u03b2-turns at \u2248208 nm. At the same time, the number of peptide configurations containing both helix and coils decreases by 3.0 %, but the distributions are affected differently: the residues involved in helix secondary structure decrease in both number and frequency, while the variance of the number of residues in a coil configuration increase (Figure 5d, e) . In other words, the peptide losses \u03b1-helix structure in favor of the formation of \u03b2-turns or coils. Overall, the formation of stable PSM\u03b11/GQD complexes by electrostatic interactions leads to relevant changes in the secondary structure and peptide motifs, and therefore we expect the presence of GQDs to affect unfavorably the organization of PSM\u03b11 All rights reserved.

Specifically, the statistics of the inter-peptide distance (center of mass) were collected and analyzed (Figure 5f) . The results show that the average distance increased from 0.76 \u00b1 0.062 nm to 1.03 \u00b1 0.055 nm when a GQD is in close proximity. Moreover, the distribution changes from a relatively symmetric monomodal bell-shaped curve centered at 0.9 nm to a distribution with three peaks (at 0.57, 0.97 and 1.2 nm) with a wide shoulder at 0.8 nm. While each peak is composed by a variety of configurations (representative complexes are shown in correspondence of each peak in Figure 5f ), the analysis of the trajectories suggests that the inter-peptide Nterminal/C-terminal interaction, responsible for the dimer stability is disrupted by the presence of the GQD. Additionally, as the GQD interacts with N-terminal of a peptide, it alters the contact angle of the peptide backbones and causes the groups close to the N-terminal to stretch. Overall, the interaction between GQD and PSM peptides strongly suggests a frustration of the amyloid fibrillation, as observed experimentally (Figure 6a) , caused by the GQDs docking near the Nterminus of the peptides and by changes in the secondary structure (Figure 6b, c) .\n\nAll rights reserved.

Here we identify GQDs as a potential therapeutic for this purpose. The specificity for amyloid-rich biofilms and lack of direct bacterial toxicity implicate amyloidforming PSM peptides in the ECM as the molecular target for GQDs. This mechanism was confirmed through experiments with isolated biofilm ECM and synthetic PSM\u03b11 as well as MD simulations. We conclude that GQDs disperse S. aureus biofilms by competitive assembly with amyloid peptides. The targeted disruption of functional amyloid formation likely results in increased free or oligomeric PSM peptides. 32 The combination of reduced amyloid mediated biofilm stabilization and increased monomeric surfactant PSMswhich have been implicated in bacterial/ECM detachment 35drives biofilm dispersion. In addition, such supramolecular complexes may also interfere with QS due to increased concentration of PSM monomers/oligomers that are tightly regulated by the Agr QS system. 48, 49 Considering the broader implications of this work, additional studies on the interaction between GQDs and amyloidforming peptides in other species (e.g., Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp) will provide new approaches and insights into the potential manipulation of microbial communities. Further engineering of GQDs for enhanced association with amyloid peptides may lead to diverse effects on a wide range of biological processes, biomolecular functions, and signaling pathways.\n\nAll rights reserved.

(3) A constant area was applied to measure the area and integrated fluorescent density of the measured content.\n\nBiofilm ECM Isolation. Biofilm ECM was harvested by disrupting biofilms using vortex and sonication as previously described. 32 Briefly fibers were collected after 5-day static growth by scraping biofilms into 3 mL of potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). The biofilm suspensions were homogenized using a tissue homogenizer (Power 4, 3 minutes) to shear fibers free from the cell walls. Supernatants were clarified by repeated (\u00d72) centrifugation at 4,000 g for 15 minutes to remove cells. The cell-free supernatant was incubated in 200 mM NaCl for 24 hours at room temperature. The fibers were isolated using Millipore Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Units with a pore size of 30 kDa.\n\nBiofilms were cultured on sample holders as the standard procedure. GQDs (500 \u00b5g/mL) were added incubated for 24 hours at 37 \u00b0C. Similarly, isolated ECM was placed on sample holders and treated with GQDs. All samples were fixed in glutaraldehyde, serially dehydrated in ethanol, air dried at room temp, sputter-coated with gold and visualized using AMRAY 1910 Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope.\n\nTransmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The TEM employed in the characterization is JEOL 3011 HREM. Carbon-coated 400 mesh copper TEM grids were placed coated-side-down for 60 s onto sample drops (10 \u00b5l) of PSM\u03b11 solution with/without addition of 50, 200, 800 \u00b5g/mL GQDs for 4 and 9 days. The grids were then retrieved, washed with deionized water (two droplets).\n\nThe sample was stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate for 40 s. Grids were then blotted and airdried before imaging. For imaging cells with amyloid containing ECM, biofilms were scrapped directly on to copper TEM grids, stained with uranyl acetate, dried and imaged.\n\nAll rights reserved.
