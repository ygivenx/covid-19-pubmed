{"title": "V irus Research Expression of soluble forms of rubella virus glycoproteins in mammalian cells", "body": "human pathogen, since first trimester infection frequently results in various birth defects collectively known as congenital rubella syndrome (Cooper and Buimovici- Klein, 1985) . Currently, vaccination with live attenuated virus is the prophylactic measure of choice. However, complications such as polyarthralgia and arthritis can result, although rarely, from such immunization.\n\nThe RV virion consists of a 40s single-stranded polyadenylated RNA encapsidated by a capsid protein which is in turn enclosed in an envelope consisting of two virus encoded glycoproteins El and E2 (Oker-Blom et al., 1983) . The structural proteins of RV are initially translated as a precursor polyprotein in the order NH,-C-E2-El-COOH from a 24s subgenomic mRNA (Oker-Blom, 1984) . After synthesis, the polyprotein is cleaved to yield two membrane glycoproteins, El (58 kDa) and E2 (42-47 kDa), and a basic 33 kDa capsid (C) protein (Oker-Blom, 1984; Oker-Blom et al., 1983) . El and E2 comprise the spike complex and are thought to exist as heterodimers (Waxham and Wolinsky, 1983; Hobman et al., 1993) . Insertion of glycoproteins El and E2 into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is mediated by two independently functioning signal peptides which are cleaved by host signal peptidase (Hobman et al., 1988; Hobman and Gillam, 1989) . RV glycoproteins form a heterodimer in the ER before they are transported to and retained in the Golgi complex (Hobman et al., 1993; Baron and Forsell, 1991) . In transfected COS cells, small quantities of E2 can be detected at the cell surface in the presence or absence of El (Hobman and Gillam, 1989; Hobman et al., 1990) . E2 from RV virions has been shown to contain sialylated O-linked carbohydrates (Lundstrom et al., 1991; Sanchez and Frey, 1991) .\n\nSince antibodies with viral neutralizing (VN) and hemagglutination inhibiting (HAI) activities are directed against El (Waxham and Wolinsky, 1985; Green and Dorsett, 1986) , it has been suggested that El is the major target of the B-cell response. Therefore, a candidate subunit vaccine would contain El in an immunogenic form. The biological role of E2 is not well defined, although it has been reported to possess strain-specific epitopes (Dorsett et al., 1985) and possibly at least one neutralizing domain (Green and Dorsett, 1986).\n\nRV El and E2 are rich in cysteine residues and contain intramolecular disulfide bridges that are important in maintaining proper protein folding (Qiu et al., 1992a (Qiu et al., , 1992b . RV glycoproteins purified from virions show greatly reduced antigenicity compared with intact virus (Loo et al., 1986) . This is presumably due to disruption of the conformation of E2 and El during isolation. Bio-engineered El expressed in Escherichiu coli is low in immunogenicity as compared to the native El and does not elicit the production of HA1 antibodies, although it is able to induce a low level of VN antibodies (Terry et al., 1989) . Expression of soluble forms of RV El and E2 proteins in cultured cells would facilitate isolation of antigenic El and E2 proteins for biochemical studies as well as development of serodiagnostic assays and subunit vaccines for RV. In this study, we have investigated the possibility of expressing soluble forms of RV El and E2 proteins in cultured cells that can be used for the large-scale preparation of immunogenic El and E2. To remove the putative transmembrane domain of E2, the region encoding the C-terminal 60 amino acids was deleted by cutting the plasmid with XbaI followed by partial digestion with NcoI. The XbaI and NcoI termini were made blunt with T4 DNA polymerase and ligated using T4 DNA ligase. ElE2ATM (Fig. lf> was created by replacing the BumHI-Hind111 fragment from pCMV5-E2El ( Fig. le) with the BamHI-Hind111 fragment from ElATM (Fig. lb) , resulting in the plasmid pCMV5-E2El ATM.\n\nCOS cells were transfected with recombinant plasmids and labelled with L3$] methionine. RV-specific proteins were immunoprecipitated as previously described (Hobman and Gillam, 1989). The immune complexes were washed and the RV antigen was eluted into 100 mM sodium citrate (pH 5.5), 0.15% SDS, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 100\u00b0C for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Laemmli, 1970). Some immunoprecipitates were digested with endoglycosidase H (5 mu/50 ~0, N-glycosidase F/ endoglycosidase F (200 mu/50 ~11, 0-glycosidase (2 mu/50 ~0, or neuraminidase (10 mu/50 ~1) as described by the supplier (Boehringer Mannheim).\n\nUsing Lipofectin (Gibco), we cotransfected dihydrofolate reductase deficient (dhfr-) Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHODG44) (Urlaub and Chasin, 1980 ) with pCMV5-E2El ATM and the plasmid pFR400 (Simonsen and Levinson, 1983 ). The latter plasmid contains a mouse dhfr gene under the control of the SV40 early promoter which can be used as a selectable marker. Clones were selected for their ability to grow in dialyzed fetal bovine serum (which does not contain nucleosides), indicating that they were expressing the transfected dhfr gene. Selected clones were expanded and screened for the presence of RV antigen by indirected i~unofluor~scen~e (Hobman et al., 1.990) and secretion of RV El by radioim-munopre~ipitation.\n\nSequence analysis and in vitro translocation experiments suggest that RV El is a type 1 membrane glycoprotein anchored in the lipid bilayer by a C-terminal hydrophobic domain (Clarke et al., 1987; Hobman et al., 1988) . Removal of this domain (TM) should convert it into a soluble protein. Codons for a 27-amino acid peptide encoding the transmembrane anchor of El, located 13 residues from the C-terminus of the protein (Fig. la>, were deleted by using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel, 1985) . The resultant ElATM cDNA was cloned into the EcoRI and Hind111 sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV5 (Andersson et al., 1989) and transfected into COS cells using DEAE-dextran (500 pg/ml) as previously described (Hobman et al., 1988) . Forty hours post-transfection, cells were pulse-labelled with 100 $Zi [35S]-methionine for 30 min and chased for the indicated times in medium with excess unlabelled methionine. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitates of RV proteins were prepared using human anti-RV serum as described (Hobman et al., 1989) . Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. The ElATM glycoprotein was not detected in the medium of transfected cells after a 3-h chase period, nor was there any evidence of N-linked sugar processing (Fig. 2a) . ElATM glycoprotein remained completely sensitive to endo H even after a 6-h chase period (not shown) suggesting that transport was arrested before the medial Golgi apparatus. Moreover, indirect immunofluorescence indicated that ElATM protein was present largely in the rough ER (not shown) in contrast to wild type El, which accumulates in a post-rough ER, pre-Golgi compartment (Hobman et al., 1990; 1992) .\n\nRV El may contain a signal that blocks its transport, as has been described for a limited number of other membrane glycoproteins (Colley et al., 1989; Jackson et al., 1990; Machamer and Rose, 1987; Nilsson et al., 1989) . Domains known to date that cause retention of membrane proteins in the ER or Golgi apparatus are located within membrane-spanning peptides or in the immediate proximity. To determine if this were the case with El, we made the construct, ElABamHI (Fig.  Id) that encodes an El protein lacking the C-terminal 173 amino acids including the putative transmembrane region and flanking luminal and cytoplasmic domains. COS cells were transfected with pCMVS-ElABamHI and labelled with [35S] methionine. Following a 3-h chase period, none of the ElA BamHI glycoprotein could be detected in the medium of radiolabelled transfected cells (Fig. 2a) . Consistent with these observations, the 39-kDa deletion mutant protein was distributed in a cytoplasmic reticular pattern characteristic of the ER (not shown). For unknown reasons, we consistently observed that ElABamHI glycoprotein was expressed at lower levels per cell than ElATM and wild type El proteins (not shown). One problem associated with identifying retention signals by deletion analysis is that very often the resultant proteins do not fold properly and are retained in the ER. In order to address the question of whether the cytoplasmic tail of El was preventing ElATM protein from being secreted, we created ElTMCT- (Fig. lc) . The codon Glu 441, immediately preceding the 27-amino acid transmembrane domain of El, was changed from GAG to TAG, such that translation of the anchor and cytoplasmic domains did not occur. We found that the ElTMCT-glycoprotein behaved similarly to ElATM and ElABamHI proteins in that it remained cell-associated in transfected COS cells, and was not detected in the medium after a three hour chase period (Fig. 2b) . \n\nTo determine if truncated E2 glycoprotein could be secreted from COS cells, a truncated E2 cDNA, E2ATM (Fig. lg) , was constructed by using convenient restriction sites in the E2 cDNA. The E2ATM cDNA was then subcloned into pCMV5 and transfected into COS cells, which were used for biosynthetic labelling experiments. We found that the E2ATM glycoprotein (37 kDa) was secreted in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3a) and contained endo H-resistant sugars (Fig. 3b,  medium, lane H) . In contrast, the 32 kDa intracellular form of E2ATM contained mainly endo H-sensitive sugars (Fig. 3b, cells, lane H) . Digestion with the enzyme mixture (N-glycosidase F/ endoglycosidase F) that hydrolyzes N-linked glycans of the high mannose and the complex type, reduced the size of intracellular (32 kDa) and secreted (37 kDa) E2 to 24 and 28 kDa respectively, indicating the presence of high mannose and complex type N-linked sugars on these proteins (Fig. 3b , lane N/F). To investigate the possibility that the higher apparent molecular weight observed in the secreted E2 was due to the presence of O-linked sugars, immunoprecipitates were digested with 0-glycosidase before and after neuraminidase treatment. The mobility of the intracellular E2 was not affected by the treatments (Fig. 3b, cells) , whereas a lower molecular weight band was observed in the secreted E2 after the treatment with neuraminidase and 0-glycosidase (Fig. 3b,  medium) , demonstrating the presence of O-linked glycans on the secreted form of E2. The slight decrease in the apparent molecular weight of the secreted E2 after neuraminidase treatment indicated that some of the oligosaccharides contained terminal sialic acid (Fig. 3b , medium, lane Ne).\n\nPreviously it was demonstrated that coexpression of E2 results in transport of a limited amount of El to the surface of COS cells (~obman et al., 1990) . To determine if El ATM protein would be secreted when coexpressed with E2, a cDNA encoding the RV E2 gene and El ATM protein was created by replacing the BamHI-Hind111 fragment from the pCMV5-E2El (Fig. le> (Hobman and Gillam, 1989) with the BamHI-Hind111 fragment from pCMV5-ElATM (Fig. lb) , resulting in the plasmid pCMVS-E2ElATM (Fig. If) . Following transfection of this plasmid into COS cells, a 54 kDa soluble El glycoprotein could be detected in the medium after 60 min of chase (Fig. 4a) , suggesting that the 27-amino acid peptide deleted from El was indeed the only membrane-spanning region of this protein. RV E2 was also present in the medium of these cells, although in much lower amounts (Fig. 4a) . At present it is unclear whether proteolytic cleavage occurred to release E2 into the medium. Alternatively, the interaction of E2 with ElATM may have altered its conformation such that it was not as stable in the membrane. In contrast, no El was detected in the medium of cells expressing proteins from pCMV5-ElATM alone or from pCMV5-E2EI after four hours of chase, although some E2 could be detected in the medium in the latter case (Fig. 4b, lane 4,  arrowhead) .\n\nIn order to be useful for the production of soluble El for subunit vaccines or for diagnostic purposes, a better expression system than transient transfection is necessary. Using Lipofectin (Gibco) we cotransfected dhfr-Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO DG44 ~Urlaub and Chasm, 19801) with pCMV5-E2ElATM and the plasmid pFR400 (Simonsen and Levinson, 1983 ). The latter plasmid contains a mouse dhfr gene under the control of the SV40 early promoter, which can be used as a selectable marker. Clones were selected for their ability to grow in dialyzed fetal bovine serum (i.e., in the absence of nucleosides), indicating that they were expressing the transfected dhfr gene. Selected clones were expanded and screened for the presence of RV antigen by indirect immunofluorescence and secretion of RV El by radioimmunoprecipitation. Fig. 5 shows the results of a bios~thetic labelling experiment with one of the stable El-secreting cell lines, CHO-E2ElATM. The autoradiograph was scanned with a densitometer and it was found that after one, two and four hours of chase, 5%, 18% and 28% respectively, of the total El was found in the medium (Fig. 5) . Judging by the heterogeneity of the E2 and El RV proteins were recovered from cell lysates or media by radioimmunoprecipitation with human anti-RV serum or anti-El monoclonals (HA1 and VN lanes). Immunoprecipitates were split into two parts and incubated at 37\u00b0C with or without 2 mU endo H glycosidase for at least 12 h. Equal amounts of immunoprecipitates from cell lysates and media samples were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE.\n\n[14C]-labelled molecular weight standards (kDa) were included for reference. Viral neutralizing (VN) antibody 21B9H, and hemagglutination inhibiting (HAI) antibody H4C52 were used to precipitate 4-h chase media from labelled CHO-E2ElATM cells. The identify of the 85-90 kDa band precipitated with human anti-RV serum (arrow) is unknown. bands (Fig. 3 , RV glycoproteins expressed in CHO cells appeared to be more heavily glycosylated than those expressed in COS cells. Very little E2 was detected in the medium of transfected CHO cells. Golgi processed E2 from CHO cells migrated more heterogeneously on SDS-PAGE than E2 from COS cells. Consequently, it was more spread out and more difficult to detect by autoradiography. Therefore, there may be just as much E2 secreted from CHO cells, but because of the heterogeneous glycosylation, it was not easily visible in the medium. Although 28% of the El was secreted after four hours, approximately 60% of the cell-associated El was resistant to endo H glycosidase. Whether this fraction of El is retained in the Golgi apparatus or on the cell surface in complex with membraneanchored E2 has not been determined. Additionally, another protein of 85-90 kDa was found to coprecipitate with El from the culture medium, but was not El-specific since it was not recognized by two monoclonal antibodies to El (arrow, \n\nAt present, serological techniques with whole RV as target antigens for the detection of antibodies to RV are most commonly used for laboratory diagnosis of acute and congenital rubella infections and for determination of rubella immunity. These assays lack defined specificity against individual structural proteins and it is not known which RV antigens are detected in the assays. Katow and Sugiura (1985) observed that antibodies to El protein were predominant following most RV infections. In contrast, antibodies to E2 protein were relatively more abundant in congenital rubella syndrome than in other forms of RV infection. Thus it may be necessary to use antigenic forms of individual RV structural proteins in serodiagnostic assays. In this regard, stable cell lines expressing high levels of secreted E2 and El may prove to be convenient sources of E2 and El for serological diagnosis of RV immune status as well as RV vaccine development.\n\nIn this study, we have converted the normally membrane-bound RV glycoproteins E2 and El into secreted forms using a transient expression system. Although E2 is normally present as a member of the heterodimeric spike complex, it did not require El for transport to the cell surface in its soluble form and behaves like previously described secretable forms of viral glycoproteins (Gething and Sambrook, 1982; Rose and Bergmann, 1982). In contrast, ElATM protein was retained intracellularly when expressed in the absence of E2 (Fig. 2) . Secreted ElATM protein from CHO-E2ElATM retained the capacity to bind to anti-El monoclonal antibodies with VN and HA1 properties (Fig. 5) , demonstrating that the protein retains epitopes expected to be important properties of a subunit vaccine against RV. VN and HA1 epitopes on El have been mapped between amino acids 245-285 by Terry et al. (1988) and 202-285 by Wolinsky et al. (1991) . It is probable that this region of the protein may have acquired its native tertiary structure by the time the C-terminus of ElATM protein is released into the lumen of the ER. Whether or not ElATM protein can elicit the production of VN and HA1 antibodies remains to be determined."}
