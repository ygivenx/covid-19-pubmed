{"title": "To appear in: One Health", "body": "The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019, causing a pandemic. Within a short time, it has spread to countries on all continents disrupting the daily life of people and having serious impact on the world economy. The latest rapid risk assessment from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) stated that Europe was heading for sustained community transmission, containment is no longer possible and that community control measures are needed [1] . The virus is likely to spread to the rest of the world within a short time.\n\nCountries are implementing different community control measures. The control measures have profound and long lasting negative effects on society and economy, but when effective, they ensure health systems can keep up with the number of seriously ill people and ultimately s ave lives [2] . The heterogeneity in control approaches is naturally caused by differences in culture, health systems and stage in the epidemic, but may also be influenced by the lack of objective and robust surveillance that maps the evolution of the epidemic and provide evidence to inform control approaches in advance. Approaches to obtain population-based evidence are rapidly needed.\n\nThe size and the consequences of the outbreak are unknown. Most countries follow a traditional and vigilant approach of disease surveillance mainly based on case identification (syndromic surveillance), tracing and testing of contacts and high-risk individuals (risk-based surveillance) with daily reporting of: infected, recovered and deaths cases, at area and country level [3] . This allows treatment and isolation of ill people and quarantine of individuals. However, it does not allow warning or forecasting of cases early and ahead of time, nor give an objective overview of the situation to inform decision-making in regards to direction of medical resources or the best timing for community control measures.\n\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof Syndromic surveillance and risk-based surveillance are paramount in epidemics, especially when the disease is emerging and new in a population [4, 5] . The risk-based surveillance on high-risk individuals e.g. contacts, enhances the ability to detect the expected few new cases as soon as possible by targeting those that are more likely to be infected than others. In a very low prevalence or early epidemic scenario, risk-based surveillance is cost-efficient and more likely to find cases than random survey-based surveillance, because resources are targeted at the high-risk subpopulations. However, once the infection becomes established and individual clusters are no longer traced, the usefulness of syndromic or risk-based surveillance data to guide control decisions at community level is reduced, because the cases identified are not representative of the infected individuals in the population. Furthermore, identified cases will already be needing health care and the health systems become reactive to the current situation, rather than proactive in prioritising, what is needed where in the coming weeks.\n\nAs veterinary epidemiologists, we applaud the work that is currently being done by public health systems all around the world. It is an impressive effort and it will save many lives. In veterinary The benefits of repeated surveys in control of epidemics are documented in animal health and we encourage public health entities to consider, how these could be adapted to a public health setting during the COVID-19 outbreak. For repeated surveys to be useful for policy-making, they require strong public health leadership, but may benefit from collaboration with veterinary epidemiologists, to build on their experience epidemics in animals. Suggestions and methodology for design of random repeated surveys during the COVID-19 epidemic and for interpreting and translating the outcomes into control decision-support can be found in the accompanying short communication [6] .\n\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof Both COVID-19 and the control measures have profound and long-lasting effects on the world economy, with companies closing, unemployment rocketing, social insecurity rising and increase in deaths as health systems struggle to cope. We strongly encourage the use of robust science for decision-making to ensure evidence-based decisions and to minimise the impacts of the epidemic, and suggest that randomized surveys that generate representative community estimates could provide additional support for policy decisions, in addition to the current surveillance strategies."}
