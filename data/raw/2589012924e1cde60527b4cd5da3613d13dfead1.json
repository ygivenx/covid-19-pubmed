Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk for acquiring emerging infection while caring for patients. Among 186 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) during the 2015 outbreak in South Korea, 39 (21.0%) were HCWs who were exposed to MERS-CoV at 12 healthcare facilities [2] . Thirty (83.3%) HCWs were infected with MERS-CoV during the course of their treatment without knowing whether the patient was infected with MERS-CoV [2] . There is no approved post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) therapy for the prevention of MERS-CoV infection. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of PEP therapy for HCWs exposed to patients with severe MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia. Safety of the PEP regimen was also evaluated.\n\nSample MERS-CoV pneumonia case, study setting, and study population A 70-year-old woman henceforth known as patient A was admitted to hospital A complaining of back pain. At the time of admission, the patient had pneumonia with fever lasting 10 days. Two days later, patient A was transferred to intensive care unit where she received endotracheal intubation. Since a diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was not suspected during this period, HCWs did not use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). As no specific pathogen was identified, testing for MERS-CoV infection was conducted. Real-time reverse transcriptaseepolymerase chain reaction (rRTePCR) was strongly positive for MERS-CoV [3] . Patient A had cycle threshold (C T ) values of 17.9 for envelope protein gene and 18.2 for open reading frame 1a gene. After patient A had been diagnosed with MERS-CoV, rapid contact tracing was performed and possible contact exposures were divided into two groups: high-risk and non-high-risk exposure groups. HCWs with highrisk exposure were isolated and immediately offered oral ribavirin (Viramid capsules; Ilsung Pharmaceuticals, Seoul, South Korea) and lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra; Abbvie Inc., North Chicago, IL, USA). The PEP protocol was initiated between days 1 and 3 after the last unprotected exposure to patient A. PEP therapy was administered until day 14 after the last exposure according to the incubation period of the disease [1] . Ribavirin was administered orally at a loading dose of 2000 mg followed by 1200 mg every 8 h for 4 days and then 600 mg every 8 h for 6e8 days. Lopinavir/ritonavir was administered orally at a dose of 400 mg/100 mg every 12 h for 11e13 days. Laboratory testing for HCWs in the PEP group was performed on days 3, 7, and 11 after treatment initiation. HCWs who received PEP therapy also underwent two-point sputum screening with MERS-CoV rRTePCR. To improve detection of unrecognized MERS-CoV infection in the PEP group, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Euroimmun, L\u00fcbeck, Germany) was also performed to detect MERS-CoV immunoglobulin G (IgG) after completion of PEP therapy [4] .\n\nFor control group selection, four hospitals with super-spread events were retrospectively selected. A retrospective comparative study was conducted for five hospitals of South Korea. Hospitals AeD are secondary referral hospitals whereas hospital E is a tertiary referral hospital. Each hospital had a corresponding MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia patient (patients AeE). Pre-isolation pneumonia patients visited participating hospitals without knowing that they were infected with MERS-CoV. C T data were available for all five MERS-CoV preisolation pneumonia patients. C T values of the five patients were similar. HCWs with unprotected exposure to patients with MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia were enrolled from the above five hospitals between May and July 2015. We only included HCWs with high-risk exposure. HCWs from hospital A treated with PEP represented the PEP group. HCWs from other hospitals who did not receive PEP were classified as the non-PEP group. HCWs in the non-PEP group were isolated and monitored for the development of MERS-like symptoms for 14 days from the date of exposure to a patient with MERS. The incidence of MERS-CoV infection was compared between these groups.\n\nDuring the MERS outbreak in South Korea, each hospital had conducted a contact survey to evaluate exposure levels. Five investigators at each hospital individually collected data and reviewed potential exposures. Epidemiological data were obtained by medical record review and personal interview between May and July of 2015.\n\nDefinitions MERS-CoV infection was confirmed using rRTePCR. Preisolation pneumonia was defined when a patient was diagnosed with pneumonia prior to quarantine without knowledge of their MERS-CoV infection. High-risk exposure was arbitrarily defined as any of the following: direct care without aerosolgenerating procedures with inappropriate PPE, or unprotected exposure to patients with MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia during aerosol-generating procedures. The definition of appropriate PPE was based on previous recommendations [5] . The absence of any part of the PPE constituted an unprotected exposure. We defined the following as aerosolgenerating procedures: airway suction, application of a highflow O 2 instrument, bronchoscopy, endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, nebulizer treatment, sputum induction, positive pressure ventilation, manual ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Several HCWs had more than one type of exposure. Duplicate exposures were recorded.\n\nBaseline characteristics of PEP and non-PEP groups were compared using c 2 -tests or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and Student's t-tests or ManneWhitney U-tests for continuous variables. MERS-CoV attack rate was compared between groups using Fisher's exact test. Categorical variables are presented as frequencies and proportions where continuous variables are presented as mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile ranges (IQR). No multivariate analysis was conducted due to small sample size. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidential interval (CI) were also calculated for each variable. All P-values were two-tailed. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. PASW version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.\n\nThe PEP group in this study was informed that the efficacy of PEP for MERS-CoV infection was unknown and that adverse effects were possible. Individual participation was voluntary. All participants provided written informed consent prior to initiating PEP therapy. This study was approved by the institutional review board of each respective hospital.\n\nIn all, 123 HCWs with unprotected exposure to MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia patients were identified at five participating hospitals. Of these, 43 HCWs met the definition of high-risk exposure (Figure 1 ). Twenty-two HCWs were classified into the PEP group; the remaining 21 HCWs were classified into the non-PEP group. Baseline characteristics were generally similar between the two groups (Table I) except that the median age of the PEP group was significantly lower than that of the non-PEP group. None of these HCWs with high-risk exposure had worn an N95 respirator, isolation gown, goggles, or facial shield. The most common type of exposure to MERS-CoV was via direct care without aerosol-generating procedure for MERS-CoV patient (39.5%), followed by airway suction (39.5%) and nebulizer treatment (34.9%). Eighteen (41.9%) HCWs were only exposed to MERS-CoV via direct care without aerosolgenerating procedure. Of these, 17 were in the non-PEP group and one was in the PEP group (P < 0.001).\n\nSix (14.0%) out of 43 HCWs developed MERS-CoV infection. The attack rate was lower in the PEP group compared to that in the non-PEP group (0% vs 28.6%; OR: 0.405; 95% CI: 0.274e0.599; P \u00bc 0.009). There was no instance of MERS-CoV infection in the PEP group. Of the six HCWs infected with MERS-CoV, one was exposed to two events (cardiopulmonary resuscitation and airway suction). Only PEP therapy was a significant factor (OR: 0.714; 95% CI: 0.545e0.936; P \u00bc 0.009) that reduced the risk of MERS-CoV infection.\n\nIn the PEP group, PEP therapy was initiated within a median of 36 h (range: 16e80 h) after unprotected exposure to a MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia patient. HCWs received PEP therapy for a median duration of 12 days (IQR: 11e12 days). PEP therapy was generally well tolerated, although some minor adverse effects were reported. Overall, 21 (95.5%) out of 22 HCWs in the PEP group reported one or more symptoms during the course of therapy. The most common symptoms were diarrhoea (40.9%), nausea (40.9%), stomatitis (18.2%), and fever (13.6%). Twenty out of 22 HCWs in the PEP group underwent laboratory testing. Anaemia and leucopenia were observed in nine (45.0%) and eight (40.0%) HCWs, respectively, during PEP therapy. Hyperbilirubinaemia was observed in all 20 HCWs. However, other liver function tests were within normal ranges. Elevated total bilirubin and decreased values of haemoglobin and leucocyte were normalized after completion of PEP therapy.\n\nMERS-CoV rRTePCR was performed on samples obtained from HCWs in the PEP group immediately after and seven days after completion of the PEP protocol. All test results were negative. Serum samples collected at six and 12 weeks after unprotected high-risk exposure were negative for MERS-CoV antibody.\n\nIn this preliminary study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of PEP in HCWs after unprotected high-risk exposure to patients diagnosed with severe MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia. Despite more severe exposure, no MERS CoV infection occurred in the PEP group. PEP therapy appeared to reduce the risk of MERS-CoV in HCWs with unprotected high-risk exposure to MERS patients by 40% in this study.\n\nThe [2]. The infection rate of MERS-CoV was estimated to be 16% among HCWs, which was more than four-fold the average estimated household transmission rate [6] . The main mode of MERS-CoV transmission is via respiratory droplets, indicating that HCWs are at particularly high risk for MERS-CoV infection [1] . Therefore, high-risk exposure during aerosol-generating procedures including tracheal intubation without appropriate PPE may increase the risk of MERS-CoV contamination. It was decided to administer prophylactic antiviral agents to HCWs with high-risk exposure to MERS patients, taking these various factors into consideration, although currently there is no recommendation for MERS-CoV PEP. Our PEP regimen was based on available literature and evidence obtained from animal and patient studies [7e10]. In the absence of current guidelines for PEP therapy, PEP agents were administered until the 14th day after the last exposure based on incubation period of the disease.\n\nPEP therapy was associated with several adverse effects, although most of them were mild. All adverse events were reversed following completion of therapy. No HCWs discontinued treatment due to adverse effects. The frequency, severity, duration and reversibility of adverse effects are important considerations when formulating a prophylactic regimen. In this regard, PEP regimen appears to be a reasonably safe choice for prophylaxis after MERS-CoV exposure.\n\nOur study has several limitations. This was a retrospective study with a small number of participants. Inevitable selection and unmeasured confounding bias could not be completely excluded. During a large outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea, only hospital A administered PEP to HCWs with high-risk exposure to MERS patients. To minimize selection bias, five MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia patients who had severe pneumonia and similar C T values as source of exposure were selected. In addition, our comparator group was carefully selected with a focus on degree of exposure.\n\nSelf-report was used to determine MERS-CoV exposure experience of HCWs. This might have a recall bias. The best method to evaluate novel therapies is via a randomized controlled clinical trial setting. However, such a method is neither feasible nor ethical in the context of an emerging and relatively uncommon infectious disease under unexpected outbreak. Despite a small number of participants, this is a study with the largest sample size to date to assess the effectiveness of a PEP therapy for the prevention of MERS-CoV infection.\n\nWe believe that our PEP guidelines for MERS-CoV infection can be useful for the management of outbreaks. Nonetheless, prospective analyses and randomized clinical studies are needed in the future. "}
