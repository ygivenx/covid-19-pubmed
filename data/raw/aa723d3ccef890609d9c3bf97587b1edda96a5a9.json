{"title": "Clinical Microbiology Newsletter Are Virus Infections Triggers for Autoimmune Disease?", "body": "Autoimmunity is the process whereby the immune system, which normally protects the host from microorganisms, malfunctions or is fooled and attacks \"self,\" destroying host tissues and leading to immunopathology.\n\nBoth genetic and environmental influences are important in the induction and progression of autoimmune diseases (1). Autoimmune diseases are classified as either organ specific or systemic, depending on whether the autoimmune responses are against antigens confined to a particular organ or widely distributed throughout the body (2).\n\nViruses have long been thought to trigger autoimmunity, thereby leading to autoimmune disease. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain virus triggers of autoimmune disease. One mechanism is molecular mimicry, whereby the immune response to the virus cross-reacts with self, resulting in autoimmunity (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . Another is epitope spreading, in which an initial immune response to a single epitope of a selfprotein progresses to an immune response to other self-epitopes of the same protein (intramolecular spreading) and then to other self proteins (intermolecular spreading) (8-l 1). A related mechanism is bystander activation, whereby virus infection causes infhunmation and tissue damage in the surrounding area, thus releasing host antigens, which together with induced immune host factors initiate autoimmunity (12,13). It has been proposed that multiple virus infections may be required for the development of autoimmunity. The initial infection may prime the immune system, while a subsequent infection with the same or antigenically related virus may trigger the autoimmune reaction (14).\n\nApproximately 40 autoimmune diseases exist in humans (1). organspecific autoimmune diseases include insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM, Type l), rheumatic heart disease, and thyroiditis. IDDM is the autoimmune disease that occurs after the destruction of the pancreatic fl cells by T lymphocytes (15). Characteristics of IDDM are insufficient insulin secretion and the inability to regulate glucose homeostasis (16). Rheumatic heart disease is the autoimmune disease affecting various regions of the heart. It can follow streptococcal infection in which there are cross-reactive epitopes between the streptococcus and heart tissue (17). Thyroiditis is the autoimmune disease that occurs after the destruction of thyrocytes (18). Characteristics of thy-roid&is are defective thyroid cell fimction and lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid with or without the presence of a goiter (18 \n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common human demyelinating disease. MS affects approximately 1 in 1,000 individuals in the United States (23). The disease is usually diagnosed in persons between the ages of 20 and 40 and affects women twice as often as men. It is an autoimmune disease of the CNS characterized by inflammatory demyelinating lesions that coalesce into large plaque-like regions within white matter (24). The main target in MS is thought to be the oligodendrocyte, the cell that forms myelin in the CNS. The lesions can appear in the optic nerve, brainstem, spinal cord, and periventricular white matter and can be multifocal in time and space. The autoreactive cells thought to be involved in lesion formation in MS are T cells (22).\n\nThe clinical course of MS varies t?om individual to individual. The clinical course of MS can be classified into four forms: relapsing-remitting (RR), primary progressive (PP), secondary progressive (SP), and progressive relapsing (PR) (25). RR-MS consists of disease relapses with full recovery or a residual deficit upon recovery but no progression between the relapses. PP-MS shows progression continuously from the onset. SP-MS is initially RR disease that is followed by progressive disease. PR-MS shows progression from the onset, with acute relapses and progression between the relapses.\n\nContrary to what would be expected because of its autoimmune nature, epidemiological studies point to a viral or microbial infection as the etiological agent for MS (26). After contact with\n\nNorth Americans or Europeans, isolated populations with no reported cases of MS demonstrated an initial wave of MS followed by secondary cases appearing in small epidemics (27). As the distance from the equator increases, the risk of MS increases. Migration studies demonstrate that individuals moving between high-and low-risk areas for MS carry the risk of the area from which they move, if they move a&r age 15, but acquire the risk of the area to which they move if they move before age 15 (Pig. 1) (28). These studies suggest that exposure to or repeated infections with an agent before puberty contribute to determining an individual's risk for MS.\n\nViruses have long been suggested to be the cause of MS. Viruses have been isolated directly from MS patients, and antibodies to viruses have been detected in them; however, to date, no single virus has been identified as the causative agent (29). On the other hand, exacerbations of MS have been correlated with viral infections (30) (31) (32) (33) . Several animal models of MS are based on viral infections; for example, canine distemper virus infection of dogs, visna virus infection of sheep, and murine coronavirus and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infection of mice (11, 29, (34) (35) (36) (37) . The presence of persistent virus infection in these animals results in demyelination with characteristic features similar to MS in humans.

EAE can be induced in mice by injection of peptides from CNS proteins such aa myelin basic protein, myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (38) . The type of EAE induced depends on the immunization protocol, the mouse strain, and the antigen used.\n\nOur laboratory has developed a model, baaed on EAE, which provides evidence tbat multiple virus infections can induce autoimmunity (14). The initial infection primes the immune system, while a subsequent infection or other non-specific immunologic stimulus can trigger the disease. The mice used are 3to Qweek-old (mimicking pre-puberty) female SJUJ mice, which are genetically susceptible to EAE. In our model, we use one of two different methods for the initial priming infection. The first is the injection of plasmid cDNA encoding ubiquitin fused to PLP. The second is infection with recombinant vaccinia virus encoding CNS proteins. These agents approximate what could occur during virus infection when virus proteins, having molecular mimicry with self-CNS proteins, are synthesized within the cytoplasm of infected cells. Tbe subsequent infection or non-specific immunologic stimulus for the first priming method was either phosphate buffered saline (PBS) emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding p galactosidase. PLP,39-,s, emulsified in CFA was used as a positive control and PBS alone as a negative control. The subsequent non-specific immunologic challenge for the second priming method was CFA, either with or without whole Bordetella pertussis organisms, Mice primed with the cDNA plaamid and triggered with CFA developed clinical and pathological signs of EAE, similar to that seen in the control group primed with cDNA plasmid and triggered with PLP,,,,,, (positive control). Mice primed with the cDNA plasmid and triggered with the recombinant vaccinia virus encoding P_galactosidase developed pathological signs of EAE without any clinical signs. Also, mice primed with the recombinant vaccinia virus encoding CNS proteins and challenged with CFA plus B. pertussis developed pathological lesions of EAE; however, no clinical signs were evident. The presence of pathological lesions in the absence of clinical symptoms has also been observed in MS in humans. Through the use of magnetic resonance imaging, disease activity in the form of pathological lesions has been observed to be 5 to 10 times higher than the disease activity recognized by clinical evaluation (39) (40) (41) .\n\nThese Iindings show how an initial early infection with a virus whose antigens display molecular mimicry to selfepitopes can prime for disease that occurs after a subsequent, non-specific immunostimulatory event. Encounters with microbes at a young age, therefore, can set the stage for the development of autoimmune disease later in life.\n\nIf, as is seen in our model, an initial encounter with a microbe can prime for disease without causing overt CNS disease itself, and disease occurs after an encounter with some non-specific agent, then this could explain why no one specific virus has been demonstrated to cause MS. The initial priming event, as well as the triggering event, may be caused by a variety of microbes, which may explain to some extent the variability in the clinical course of MS seen in individual patients. \n\nClostridium d@cile is associated with 90 to 100% of cases of pseudomembranous colitis, 60 to 75% of antibiotic-associated colitis, and 11 to 33% of antibiotic-associated cases of diarrhea (1). Asymptomatic carriage is thought to be two-to five-fold more common than the disease itself. The"}
