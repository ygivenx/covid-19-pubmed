{"title": "Development of a one-run real-time PCR detection system for pathogens associated with bovine respiratory disease complex", "body": "A total of 16 primer-probe sets were used to detect pathogens that certainly or possibly cause BRDC. Each primer-probe set was designed to detect a single\ntarget pathogen. As shown in Table 1, seven primer-probe sets were adopted from a previously reported real-time PCR assay [2, 18, 20, 21, 26, 32, 33]. The remaining nine primer-probe sets were newly designed in\nthis study. To design these primers and probes, nucleotide sequences obtained from GenBank of a target pathogen were aligned, and then, primers and probes were\nselected using PrimerQuest software (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA, U.S.A.). Accession numbers of sequences used for primer-probe design are\nlisted in Supplemental Table 1. The specificities of primers and probes were checked by BLAST\nsearch. In addition, as described in a previous report, a primer-probe set for bovine \u03b2-actin was as an internal control of RNA/DNA extraction and PCR reaction\n[31, 32]. TaqMan probes had 6-FAM (6-carboxy-fluorescein) fluorescent reporter\nmolecules at the 5\u2032 ends and TAMRA (6-carboxy-tetra-methyl-rhodamine) quencher molecules at the 3\u2032 ends. TaqMan probes targeting BPIV-3 and U.\ndiversum contained 6-FAM at the 5\u2032 ends and MGB (minor groove binder) and NFQ (non fluorescent quencher) at the 3\u2032 ends. Primers and probes were\ncustom-synthesized at Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.) and MGB probes at Applied Biosystems (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, U.S.A.).\nThe information on primers and probes is outlined in Table 1.\n\nNucleic acids were extracted using the following four commercial kits according to the manufacturers\u2019 instructions. Virus, bacteria and negative nasal swab\nsample used for the sensitivity test were centrifuged at 14,000 \u00d7g for 5 min. Viral DNA and RNA were extracted from supernatants, using a High Pure Viral\nNucleic Acid Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), with an elution volume of 25 \u00b5l. Bacterial DNA was extracted from cell pellets,\nusing a QIAamp UCP Pathogen Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a sample volume of 1 ml and elution volume of 50 \u00b5l. In\nextraction of clinical samples, RNA was extracted using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) with a sample volume of 140 \u00b5l and elution volume\nof 60 \u00b5l. DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) with a sample volume of 200 \u00b5l and elution volume of 200\n\u00b5l. The extracted DNA and RNA were stored at \u221280\u00b0C until it was tested by real-time PCR.\n\nA One Step PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (Perfect Real Time) (TaKaRa Bio, Otsu, Japan) was used to detect viral RNA, and Premix Ex Taq (Perfect Real Time) (TaKaRa\nBio) was used to detect viral and bacterial DNA. Real-time PCR assays were conducted in the same reaction conditions, including reaction mix components and\nthermal cycling, as those used in the Dembo diarrhea-PCR [31]. Fluorescent signal data were analyzed using an automatic\nquantification algorithm in LightCycler Nano Software 1.1 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH), and the parameters of analysis were as follows: exclude early cycle=7,\nminimum relative amplifications=0, and minimum amplification quality=5.\n\nTo verify the sensitivity, linearity and efficiency of the real-time PCR assay, the limit of detection (LOD), correlation coefficient (R2) and PCR\nefficiency (E) were determined from standard curves. Standard curves were obtained, and the LOD, R2 and E were calculated as described previously\n[31].\n\nIn a previous study, nasal swab samples appeared to contain a PCR inhibitor that yielded false negative results [25]. To\nevaluate PCR inhibition by nasal swab components, a positive control nucleic acid was added to negative samples after nucleic acids extraction as previously\ndescribed [3, 24]. Nasal swabs collected from clinically healthy cattle that were\nconfirmed to be negative by Dembo respiratory-PCR for all target pathogens were tested. These swabs were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (\u2212) to make 10%\nemulsion. Isolated strains of BPIV-3 strain BN-1 (AB770484), BRSV strain NMK-7, BRAV strain H-1 (JN936206), M. haemolytica strain N791\n(bovine/Japan/1979), P. multocida strain TS-8, H. somni strain 23N2359, T. pyogenes strain 42 and M.\nbovis strain Donetta were obtained from the National Veterinary Assay Laboratory in Japan. The BVDV strain Nose (bovine /Japan/1974) and BHV-1 strain\nIshikawa (bovine /Japan/1988) used in this study were isolated from field samples. To evaluate the primer-probe sets targeting BCoV, IDV, BRBV, BAdV 3 and\nU. diversum, synthesized DNA (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) was used instead of nucleic acids extracted from infectious pathogens,\nbecause these pathogens were unavailable. Nucleic acids from the 10% swab emulsion and pathogens (1.0 \u00d7 105 TCID50/ml or\nCFU/ml) were extracted as described above. Then, 10-fold serial dilutions of the extracted nucleic acids or synthesized DNA were spiked into\nthe eluates of negative nasal swabs. The final concentrations were adjusted to the following: pathogen DNA or RNA, 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22121 to 1.0 \u00d7 102\nTCID50/reaction or CFU/reaction; and synthesized DNA, 1.0 \u00d7 10\u00b0 to 103 copies/reaction. The tests were performed in duplicate using\nseparate serial dilutions. The LOD was determined, and reproducibility was evaluated using the coefficient of variation (CV) calculated from the quantification\ncycle (Cq).\n\nThe assay was applied to test clinical samples; we also evaluated the diagnostic performance of the assay. A total of 40 samples of bovine nasal swabs were\ncollected in 2015 from six farms (farms A\u2013F) in which BRDC pathogens presences were identified in Gifu Central Livestock Hygiene Service Center. Information of\nindividual cattle were indicated in Supplemental Table 2. Nucleic acids extracted from samples were\ntested in triplicated with Dembo-PCR [31]. Samples were determined positive, if the Cq values were calculated by the\nalgorithm described above in more than two of three run.\n\nTo evaluate the sensitivity, linearity and efficiency of the PCR, 10-fold serial dilutions of synthesized DNA were tested by real-time PCR. Standard curves\nwere constructed from Cq values, and then, the LOD, R2 and E were evaluated (Fig. S1). For BVDV, BHV-1 and BAdV 7, standard curves have already been\nevaluated under the same conditions in a previous study [31]. The LOD, based on DNA copy number, was \u2264100 copies/reaction\nfor all primer-probe sets. In addition, the calibration curves of all assays covered a linear dynamic range of more than five orders of magnitude and showed\nR2 values of at least 0.9818. PCR efficiencies were in the range of 84.2\u2013101.8%.\n\nThe LOD, taking into account possible PCR inhibition by components of nasal swab samples, and CV values, used to evaluate inter-assay error, are described in\nTable 2. Except for that of BPIV-3, all LODs were \u226410 TCID50/reaction for extracted nasal swabs spiked with viral nucleic acids. For bacterial\nnucleic acids, the LOD of the assay for all bacteria other than T. pyogenes was \u22641 CFU/reaction. The LOD of T. pyogenes was\nhigher than those for other bacteria. For the synthesized DNA, because the pathogens were not available, an LOD of \u2264100 copies/reaction was also obtained in\neach assay. CV values were at most 2.25%; this reproducibility was observed with BPIV-3 testing.\n\nA total of 40 nasal swabs from different affected animals on six farms with BRDC outbreaks were applied to Dembo respiratory-PCR. The results are presented as\nthe number and percentage of positive samples from each farm (Table 3). In samples from farm A, both viral and bacterial pathogens, including BRSV (85.7%), P. multocida (100%), M.\nbovis (75%) and U. diversum (75%), were detected at high frequency, whereas mainly viral pathogens, including BRSV (71.4%) and BRBV\n(85.7%) in farm E and BRSV (100%) in farm F, were prevailed. In samples from farms B and D, mixed infections of BCoV (83.3% and 100%) and bacterial pathogens\nwere detected. The results of tests of individual cattle are shown in Supplemental Table 2.\n\nIn this study, Dembo respiratory-PCR was developed, following the methods applied for Dembo diarrhea-PCR described in a previous report [31]. Since all primer-probe sets were optimized in the same temperature conditions, Dembo respiratory-PCR can detect a total of 16 pathogens,\nincluding 10 viruses and six bacteria, in a single run of TaqMan real-time PCR. Notably, we designed primers for IDV, BRAV and BRBV, which are not traditionally\ntested in Japan as etiologic agents of BRDC. IDV was first found in pigs and then from cattle, showing a significant association with BRDC [14, 23]. An assay to detect IDV by TaqMan real-time PCR has already been reported [15]. However, new IDV strains were recently identified [4,5,6, 19], and the nucleic acid sequences of some strains have mismatches to the reported\nprimer-probe set. To address this issue, a new primer-probe set was designed in this study. Nevertheless, forward primer has a few mismatches to the sequence of\nD/bovine/Ibaraki/7768/2016, which was identified very recently, and the primer is needed for further improvement. BRAV and BRBV have been commonly found in cattle\nwith BRDC in the United States [13]. BRBV was detected from BRDC cattle also in this study, but a previous study suggested\nthat BRBV was not significantly associated with BRDC [23]. The importance of BRBV in BRDC remains uncertain. IDV and BRAV\nwere undetected in the clinical samples in this study. In sensitivity test, all assays showed low LOD (\u2264100 CFU, TCID50 or copies/reaction). The LOD of\nBPIV-3 was higher than other virus (100 TCID50/reaction), but a previous study showed a similar level of sensitivity [18]. Dembo respiratory-PCR can be performed to detect pathogens that are currently considered to be associated with BRDC.\n\nBy Dembo respiratory-PCR, multiple BRDC pathogens that infect cattle can be detected comprehensively and simultaneously. The Dembo respiratory-PCR can quickly\nelucidate combinations of pathogen in a sample. Notably, in one BVDV-positive sample, BCoV, BRSV and bacterial pathogens were also detected. A previous study\nindicated that BRSV infection diminished the host\u2019s clearance ability in the upper respiratory tract or altered the immune response [9, 10], possibly facilitating bacterial opportunistic infections, whereas an experimental study showed\nthat infection with BRSV infection alone resulted in clinical signs and lesions in lung tissue [10]. As well as BRSV, BCoV\ngenerally impairs mucosal immunity in the upper respiratory tract [27]. In this way, the Dembo respiratory-PCR helps\nrevealing the infection of multiple pathogens at once. For the same purpose, multiplex PCRs that can detect utmost three pathogens were developed in the previous\nstudies [18, 30]. However, multiplex PCR has the restriction on target number and\nthe risk that primer-probe sets interfere in each other.\n\nCompared with one assay-one pathogen test, Dembo respiratory-PCR can identified a wide range of existing pathogens quickly and easily. Considering multiple\netiology of BRDC, screening by Dembo respiratory-PCR would help determining treatment and prevention measures. This detection system may provide an alternative\ntesting method that is simpler, earlier and more comprehensive than existing assays."}
