{"title": "Multicolor two-photon imaging of in vivo cellular pathophysiology upon influenza virus infection using the two-photon IMPRESS", "body": "The lung, which is a respiratory organ, has contact with the outside environment and is an important organ for research on immunity to infectious diseases. In the seventeenth century, Marcello Malpighi discovered pulmonary capillaries and alveoli in the frog lung by using optical microscopy6; now fluorescent reporter mice facilitate the study of disease models in conjunction with two-photon excitation microscopy (Table 1). However, a challenge encountered when imaging the lung is that it is constantly moving during respiration. The lung has been stabilized in several ways during in vivo observation by microscopy, including bronchus clamping, prolonged apnea, gluing, and suction7,8; however, it is difficult to reduce motion artifacts due to lung respiratory movement under physiological conditions and hence to obtain high-quality images. Bronchus clamping can suppress respiratory motion artifacts of the lung lobe9,10; however, it is not suitable for long-term observation because it causes severe hypoxia. Although prolonging apnea is less invasive11\u201313, it does not allow researchers sufficient time to observe the lung for image acquisition by two-photon excitation microscopy, and the quality of the images tends to deteriorate over time. Gluing addresses the above limitations14,15; however, it can induce shear force injury and inflammation, which affect the interpretation of results. A suction window, which is currently the most commonly used stabilizing system during lung imaging, achieves moderate immobilization of the lung and high-quality images16\u201319; however, the observation period is limited to \u226412 h. Ex vivo imaging of lungs and in vivo imaging of trachea have also been performed as complementary methods8. Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages, and it is important to select and optimize the method best suited to the goal of the experiments and disease model.\n\nIn vivo observation of lungs has been performed using various lung disease and experimental models, including bacterial infection, allergen inoculation, tumor metastasis, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis (Table 1). However, for viral respiratory diseases, such as influenza, other than an observation in a methodology report20, only analyses of the trachea in vivo21\u201323 and isolated lungs had been performed24, with no analysis of the lung in vivo, until our recent publication5 (Table 1). Unlike ex vivo methods, which involve isolated or sliced lungs, in vivo imaging using two-photon excitation microscopy of live animals enables researchers to observe hemodynamics, migration and extravasation of immune cells, as well as interactions among immune cells during influenza virus infection. However, it is technically demanding to perform two-photon excitation microscopy of live influenza virus\u2013infected lung, which exhibits severe inflammation, requiring the development of highly sophisticated, less invasive instruments and surgical techniques. In addition, when observing animals infected with pathogenic viruses, specialized facilities and instruments are frequently required to avoid the spread of the virus. Furthermore, because many types of immune cells infiltrate the infected lung in an inflammatory environment, it is necessary to distinguish the target immune cells from the infected cells by using fluorescent labels in the infected microenvironment. To detect multiple fluorescent signals excited simultaneously by a two-photon excitation laser, fluorochromes with different spectra and equal brightness must be selected; however, there is currently no comprehensive database of fluorescent reagents, fluorescent reporter viruses, and reporter mouse lines available for lung in vivo imaging. We therefore also provide a database of fluorescent dyes, antibodies, and reporter mouse lines that can be used in combination with a reporter influenza virus (Color-flu)25\u201327 for multicolor analysis under pathological conditions in this protocol.\n\nOur system uses suction-based lung stabilization16,28 to improve an existing in vivo two-photon imaging system for influenza virus\u2013infected lung as a model of an acute inflammatory respiratory disease5. We have successfully used C57BL/6 mice and transgenic mice of the C57BL/6 background (6- to 10-week-old males and females). By using our method, described in detail here, it is possible to visualize and analyze the behavior of immune cells and their interactions with infected cells during an influenza virus infection, which creates an acute inflammatory environment.\n\nA limitation of two-photon excitation microscopy is that the observation depth that can be achieved is a maximum of ~70 \u03bcm. Therefore, we cannot observe the bronchial region. This limitation is linked to the wavelength of the infrared laser and detector capability of the microscope. However, as laser technology develops, the observation depth achievable using this method will improve.\n\nIn this protocol, we describe the application of this methodology to influenza virus infection of the lungs because this is what we have used it for previously. This protocol could be applied not only to studies of the early stages of inflammation due to infection or other causes, but also to analyses of tissue regeneration mechanisms in lungs that are in the process of recovering from infection or other injuries. The information provided will also be useful to those using two-photon imaging analysis for the evaluation of the effects of drugs and vaccines, as well as biological events in the lungs and other organs (e.g., liver, spleen)5. Moreover, with minor modifications, the approach could be applied to analyses of other respiratory diseases, including other infectious models (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)), pulmonary fibrosis, and tumor metastasis.\n\n\nMice.

In our studies, we use 5 \u00b5g of antibody for brightness screening because inoculation of fluorochrome-conjugated anti-Ly-6G antibody at low doses (1\u201340 \u00b5g) into mice does not affect neutrophil recruitment38. The contribution of Ly-6G, which is expressed predominantly on murine neutrophils, to recruitment during inflammation remains a matter of debate. It has been reported that low-dose antibody treatment inhibited Ly-6G ligation and the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of inflammation39; however, a more recent study indicated that Ly-6G knockout did not affect either neutrophil differentiation or recruitment to the site of inflammation in Catchup mice32. Therefore, a low dose of anti-Ly-6G antibody is used in our protocol.\n\nThis system adjusts the laser path passing from the outside to the inside of the BSL3 facility for maintenance purposes, so there is no need for this setup unless you are using pathogens that require BSL3 containment. Heat is generated when the laser source unit is running, so keep the temperature and humidity constant by using air conditioning equipment.\n\nThe system should be operated only by users trained to deal with unenclosed high-power invisible beams and should be placed in an appropriate enclosure with interlocking doors.\n\nThe wavelength and power of the excitation laser should be adjusted appropriately according to the experimental conditions. Increasing the laser power enhances target signals and enables detection of second-harmonic generation (SHG), in which structures with repeating patterns lead to the formation of a signal. SHG is a useful phenomenon for visualizing collagen fibers in the lung without staining; however, it should be noted that the autofluorescence of lung tissue is also enhanced under excessive excitation conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1). When using this protocol, we did not perform experiments under which SHG occurs, in order to minimize autofluorescence; it is better to adjust the laser power according to the experimental purpose. When the wavelength of the excitation laser is too short, the autofluorescence signal becomes very strong and it is difficult to observe properly. By contrast, when the laser wavelength is too long, it becomes difficult to obtain a signal because of the short excitation energy (Supplementary Fig. 2).\n\nAlthough color separation of emission using a conventional optical band-pass filter is also available for this protocol, multispectral imaging is a useful approach for simultaneously analyzing multiple targets by eliminating tissue autofluorescence and identifying fluorescent labels with overlapping spectra40,41. In vivo two-photon imaging is performed under conditions of single stimulation with a two-photon excitation laser; limitations exist regarding available fluorescent reagents/proteins for multiple labeling of target cells and lung architecture. Therefore, we recommend using a multispectral approach to produce crosstalk-free images of fluorescence with overlapping spectra that cannot be separated by using band-pass filters. Before starting experiments, it is necessary to collect spectral signatures of the emission signal of each fluorescent reagent and protein as reference spectra under the same excitation condition as will be used in the experiment.\n\nTo observe the mouse lung using an upright microscope, it is necessary to prepare a thoracic suction window to immobilize the lung. In the BSL3 facility, animal experiments must be performed while wearing two or three layers of latex gloves; therefore, the thoracic suction window was designed for easy handling, even in the BSL3 facility, and to be minimally invasive for the infected animals (Fig. 3a\u2013c and Supplementary Fig. 3). To position a cover glass for each observation, flatten the upper surface of the thoracic suction window so that a commercially available cover glass will fit. This device is also designed to reduce concavity and convexity as much as possible so that blood containing virus cannot accumulate. Connect the thoracic suction window to an aspirator through a waste tank and a suction regulator. To prevent the spread of virus-containing aerosols, install HEPA filters between the waste tank and the suction regulator as shown in Fig. 3d.\n\nTiming 10\u201320 minOn Day 0, intranasally inoculate C57BL/6 (\u2018B6\u2019) mice or transgenic mice with 105 plaque-forming units (PFUs) of Color-flu viruses in 50 \u03bcl of PBS under sevoflurane anesthesia. Tables 2 and 3 show the brightness levels of fluorescence of representative reporter mouse immune cells and Color-flu viruses in vivo.CautionAll relevant guidelines regarding the use of animals and recombinant viruses should be followed.CriticalFluorescent reporter influenza viruses (Color-flu) stably express high levels of a reporter protein in the infected cells and show comparable virulence to those of wild-type influenza viruses in mice25. Depending on the experiments, modify the virus infectious dose, monitor the infected mice in the days following infection, and determine the appropriate time point for observation (e.g., when mice are infected with 103 PFU of MA-Venus-PR8, infected cells can be observed for up to 7 d post-infection). Of note, infected cells may not be observed if the infectious dose is too low.CriticalAs controls for the experiment, use wild-type mice or transgenic mice that are not infected with influenza virus and administer the same fluorescently labeled antibodies and reagents as those used in the test group.\n\nTiming 20\u201330 min2On the day of analysis, turn on the two-photon excitation laser and the Aligna 4D control unit placed outside the BSL3 facility, and verify that they are working.CriticalThe Aligna 4D control unit needs to be kept ON.3Wearing a Tyvek suit, positive pressure mask, and gloves according to the guidelines for the BSL3 facility, enter the BSL3 facility where the imaging system is housed.Troubleshooting4Turn on the microscope controllers, confocal lasers, and the computer for the two-photon excitation microscope and the Aligna 4D system.5Launch the microscope control software ZEN and turn on the lasers, including the two-photon excitation laser.6Launch the Aligna 4D control software Kangoo and adjust the laser path connecting the laser source unit and the microscope (Supplementary Fig. 4).Troubleshooting7Wrap the hot plate with aluminum foil, turn it on, and keep it at 35 \u00b0C.

Subsequently, transfer the mouse to the hot plate while supplying 2% isoflurane via an anesthetic mask.Troubleshooting\n\nTiming 5 min10Inject the chosen fluorescent dyes and antibodies via the retro-orbital plexus (as shown in Supplementary Video 1) using an insulin syringe. Tables 4 and 5 show the brightness levels of antibodies and fluorescence of dyes, respectively, in vivo.CautionWhen working with viruses in a BSL3 containment, it is not safe to use needles, so we avoid them as much as possible, which is a standard precaution in high-containment laboratories. In addition, in the BSL3 facility, animal experiments must be performed wearing two or three layers of latex gloves. Tail-vein administration is a common method; however, it is not easy to perform these procedures with so many layers of gloves. Use tweezers to hold down the mouse to make the administration route. When an infected animal is not used, an administration route can be created via the tail vein or the jugular vein.\n\nBefore experimenting with infected animals, practice the surgical procedures with euthanized animals.\n\n\n11Place the mouse on its back and tape the anterior limbs with adhesive tape (Fig. 4a).12Using straight scissors, cut the skin beneath the chin in the middle and expose the trachea (Fig. 4b). Insert a tracheal cannula and intubate the mouse to facilitate mechanical ventilation with a ventilator (Fig. 4c). Turn on the ventilator, ventilate the mouse at a respiratory rate of 120 breaths per min, and apply positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP; ~6 cm H2O) and a tidal volume of ~0.5 mL. Deliver isoflurane continuously at 2% to maintain anesthesia.CautionPerform the surgery with care so as not to cut the blood vessels. If bleeding occurs, stop the bleeding with fine bulldog forceps for microsurgery.13Place the mouse in the right lateral decubitus position and re-fix its anterior limbs with the tape (Fig. 4d). Make an incision in the skin at the left axilla using straight scissors, straight iris scissors, and hooked forceps (Fig. 4e).CautionCarefully change the mouse\u2019s position in order to avoid cannula drop off.14Expose the left lung lobe by surgical intercostal incision between ribs 3 and 4, and keep it exposed by using retractors (Fig. 4f).CautionPerform the surgery with care so as not to cut the blood vessels. If bleeding occurs, stop the bleeding with fine bulldog forceps for microsurgery.CriticalBecause lungs infected with viruses often shrink, secure a large field of surgical view so that the suction window can reach it.15Place the mouse beneath the objective lens and connect a device to monitor the heart rate of the mouse (we use a LabOx-1 pulse oximeter).\nTroubleshooting\n\n\n\nTiming 2\u20133 min16Turn on the aspirator connected to the thoracic suction window.17Fix the thoracic suction window to the holding block at a 90\u00b0 angle and put a round cover glass on the tip of the suction device.Troubleshooting18Turn on the suction pressure regulator and adjust the suction pressure to 25\u201330 mmHg.\n\nTiming 2\u20133 min19Lower the thoracic suction window gently to immobilize the mouse lungs (Fig. 4g,h). The thoracic suction window should cause the lung to stick to the cover glass because of negative pressure.CautionCarefully move the suction window so as not to scratch the objective.20Position the objective lens above the thoracic window.21Put water drops on the cover glass by using a pasteur pipette and lower the objective lens to the thoracic suction window (Fig. 4i).22Double-check the general condition of the mouse and its position.\n\nTiming 1\u20134 h per sample23Acquire images using the lambda mode of the ZEN software. Record time series at different frequencies according to need.\n\nTiming 1\u20132 h per sample24To unmix the spectrum data, prepare a reference image of each spectrum in advance. To make a reference image, acquire each fluorescent dye or protein separately without any co-staining and analyze the single fluorescent spectrum. We use the linear unmixing module of the ZEN software for separating spectrum data; however, other commercial or open-source software is available (Table 6).25Subject unmixed time-series stacks to image registration to correct for tissue drifts and respiratory artifacts. This step is critical to certain analyses, such as long-term tracking of individual cells or subcellular structures. In some cases, a reference channel is required for determining the shift and distortion of the objects. In our studies, we use time-series stacks of blood vessels or collagens for such use, because their localizations are constant over time without substantial changes in shape or structure during the observation.CautionSome image registration algorithms may cause spatial distortion. Choose algorithms that generate corrected data suitable for your subsequent analyses, especially when examination of the shape and structure of cells and tissues is required.26Analyze the movies as required for your experiment.\n\nTroubleshooting advice can be found in Table 7.\n\n\nStep 1, infection: 10\u201320 minSteps 2\u20137, starting up the imaging system equipment: 20\u201330 minSteps 8\u201322, anesthesia and surgical preparation for imaging: 21\u201329 minSteps 23\u201326, data acquisition and image analyses: 2\u20136 h per sample (depending on the number of samples, fluorescent colors, and acquired frames)\n\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article."}
