In particular, there is evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission with 2019-nCoV 6,7,9 . Meanwhile, the first case of 2019-nCoV was reported in the United States 10 . Patient presented with pneumonia and showed nonspecific signs and symptoms of mild illness. This undoubtedly increased the difficulty of early protective preparation for operating room personnel. Therefore, in containing the spread of 2019-nCoV in health-care settings, the Department of Anesthesiology, Wuhan Union Hospital has drafted a guideline for 2019-nCoV-related prevention and control, including emergency intubation, preoperative evaluation and infection control in the operating rooms. Furthermore, we aim to describe clinical features and anesthesia-related characteristics of patients infected with 2019-nCoV and suspected cases after emergency intubation and surgical anesthesia.\n\nWe hope the current study will help prevent cross-infections in the operating rooms by implementing strict anesthesia management and infection control procedures while caring for patients with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV. Moreover, the clinical features and anesthesia-related characteristics may provide further insights into 2019-nCoV from the perspective of anesthesiology.\n\nFor this retrospective, multicenter clinical study, we recruited patients with suspected 2019-nCoV from Jan 23 to Jan 31, 2020, at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan Children's Hospital, The Central Hospital of Wuhan and Wuhan Fourth Hospital in Wuhan, China. All methods were conducted following the relevant regulations and guidelines of the institutional ethics committee of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.\n\nWe reviewed electronic medical records, anesthesia records, preoperative evaluation records, nursing records, laboratory findings, and chest x-ray and CT for all patients. \n\nWe describe demographics, key clinical features (i.e., fever, cough), anesthesia-related clinical characteristics (i.e., ASA classification, Mallampati score, anesthetic methods), key laboratory findings (i.e., lymphocyte count) and chest x-ray and CT findings for all patients.\n\nData are expressed as mean (SD) and categorical variables as count (%). For laboratory results, we also assessed whether the measurements were outside the normal range. All statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism version 8 \n\nThe choice of January 23, 2020 for starting this study was because of the Chinese Lunar New Year started on January 23, and Wuhan also started to suspend public transportation on January 23, 2020 (Fig 1) , after that time the major hospitals in Wuhan suspended all elective procedures. The four hospitals selected for this study were the closest hospitals to and 1 to 4 kilometers away from the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, the suspected origin of 2019-nCoV outbreak (Fig 2) .\n\nAnesthesiologists in Wuhan have made great efforts to control this epidemic (Fig 3) . were included in this retrospective, multicenter clinical study. In total, most patients were female (23 of the 37 patients), with the mean age of 41.0 years old (SD, 19.6; range, 4 to 78). Ten (27%) patients had chronic medical illness, including 4 (11%) with diabetes, 8 (22%) with hypertension, 8 (22%) digestive system disease, 3 (8%) with nervous system disease and 8 (22%) with respiratory system disease ( For anesthesia duration, 28 (76%) patients underwent short operative anesthesia time (\u22643 hour) and 9 (24%) patients underwent longer operative anesthesia time (>3 hour).\n\nFinally, as of Jan 30, 2020, 10 (27%) of 37 patients had been discharged and 27 (73%) patients were still being hospitalized, no patient had died (Table 2 ).\n\nIn our study, we drafted and published anesthesia management and infection control Coronaviruses mainly cause respiratory tract infections in humans, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 11, 12 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) 13, 14 . In our study, most patients presented with fever, dry cough, and bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity on chest CT scans. These data are consistent with recent reports 2,6,9 .\n\nTransmission rates are unknown for 2019-nCoV; however, there is strong evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission 6,7,9 . The number of infections is rising quickly. Our results are consistent with recent reports, some infected patients had no obvious symptoms initially, including slight fever or even no fever 2, 9, 10 \n\nSupplementary material associated with this article can be found in the online version at xxx.
