{"title": "Effects of Housing and Colostrum Feeding on the Prevalence of Selected Infectious Organisms in Feces of Jersey Calves'", "body": "Dairy calf morbidity and mortality are significant losses associated with the dairy enterprise. A recent US dairy heifer management study (3) reported that mean mortality of preweaned calves was 8.4% (SE = .4); over 52% of fatalities were associated with scours. Two factors that are related to mortality and morbidity are colostrum feeding and housing.\n\nThe importance of consumption of an adequate amount of colostrum on morbidity and mortality is widely recognized (6). However, less clear are effects of the method of feeding colostrum (allowing the calf to suckle the dam or bottle feeding a known amount of previously collected colostrum) on the temporal acquisition of enteropathogenic organisms. Calves left with the dam for 72 h may be exposed to greater numbers of infectious organisms associated with the dam and environment, thereby increasing the risk of disease.\n\nHousing may affect exposure of calves to infectious organisms and subsequent morbidity and mortality (5, 9, 20, 21) . Waltner-Toews et al. (20) indicated that calves raised in hutches were 25 times less likely to be treated for pneumonia and 8 times less likely to be treated for scours than were calves raised in individual pens in a calf barn. Conversely, Martin et al. (12) and James et al. (8) reported that housing did not predispose calves to increased morbidity or mortality, but the person caring for the calf and the overall level of calf management were more important factors influencing morbidity and mortality.\n\nThe objectives of this study were to determine the effects of housing and method of colostrum feeding on the prevalence of selected infectious organisms in neonatal Jersey calves.\n\nNinety-six Jersey heifer (n = 48) and bull calves were blocked by sex and date of birth and assigned to one of four treatments in a randomized complete block design. Treatments were a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of colostrum feeding (calves were allowed to nurse the dam for 3 d or were separated from the dam and fed 1 L of colostrum in nipple-bottles at 0 and 12 h after birth) and housing (individual fiberglass hutches or individual pens in an unheated calf barn).\n\nCows were housed in a drylot until approximately 2 d prior to parturition, when they were moved to an individual calving pen bedded with straw. Cows were not immunized with viral or bacterial vaccines during the dry period. Calves fed colostrum from nipplebottles were moved to the hutch or barn before nursing. The unheated calf barn contained 40 individual wooden pens (1.2 x 2.4 m) and housed calves prior to initiation of the study. Mechanical ventilation was provided in the barn throughout the study. Calf hutches were located in an area not previously exposed to calves. Pens and hutches were thoroughly washed, disinfected, and allowed to dry prior to each use. Hutches were moved to a new location after each use. Calf pens and hutches were bedded with sawdust and straw.\n\nCalves fed by nipple-bottle were fed colostrum from the first milking, obtained from the dam shortly after parturition. Each cow was milked by hand, and a 50-ml sample of colostrum was obtained and stored (-20\u00b0C). Colos-tral composition has been reported (15) . Calves were fed 1 L of colostrum as soon as possible after birth and again 12 h later. After the second feeding, calves were fed twice daily to 3 d of age using second and third milking colostrum from the dam.\n\nCalves that nursed the dam were left with the dam until 3 d of age. Calves were assisted if nursing did not commence by 4 h. No attempt was made to measure quantitatively the colostrum consumed by nursed calves.\n\nCommercial calf starter (Tennessee Farmers Cooperative, LaVergne, TN) was offered for ad libitum consumption from d 3. Calf starter was formulated to contain a coccidiostat (Dec-coxQ; Rhcjne-Poulenc, Atlanta, GA) at 25 mg/ kg. Commercial milk replacer (Land O'Lakes, Inc., Ft. Dodge, LA) was reconstituted to 12% DM and fed twice daily (.95 L per feeding) from 3 to 35 d of age. Milk replacer was formulated to contain oxytetracycline (138 mg/ kg) and neomycin base (250 mgkg). Refused milk replacer and calf starter were weighed and reported daily. Water was available at all times. Second-cutting alfalfa hay was offered for ad libitum consumption after 14 d. Calves were weighed at birth and every 7 d thereafter to 35 d.\n\nFecal grab samples were collected from all calves every Tuesday and Friday during the study. Samples were divided into approximately equal portions, placed into two plastic sample cups, and stored at 3 or -20\u00b0C. Occasionally, no feces could be collected from calves. When insufficient quantities of feces were collected for two samples, samples were refrigerated only. Refrigerated samples were shipped to the laboratory to determine the presence of Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and Eimeria. Qualitative fecal examinations were performed with a modified flotation technique by the method of Cox and Todd (4), except that 1 g of feces was used. Samples were examined microscopically at 4 0 0~. Frozen samples were shipped to the laboratory, thawed, pooled within week of age, and refrozen prior to analysis for rotavirus and coronavirus by direct electron microscopy. A 10% suspension of feces was made in distilled water and clarified by centrifugation (27,000 x g for 40 min). The supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was resuspended in 2 to 3 ml of distilled water. Approximately 100 pl of the suspension was added to 1 ml of distilled water. One hundred microliters of 3% phosphotungstic acid were added to the sample for negative staining. Stained samples were sprayed onto copper grids coated with Fomv a P (Monsanto Co., St. Louis, MO) and carbon and scanned with an electron microscope (Philips 201 transmission electron microscope; Philips Electronic Co., Mahwah, NJ) at a plate magnification of 30,000 x with an 80-kV beam. Morphological identification of virus particles was made by examination at 300,000~.\n\nPrevalence of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli was determined using a commercial latex agglutination test for K99+ pili (W pilitest; VMRD, Inc., Pullman, WA) on eight colonies isolated from weekly samples after preenrichment in nutrient broth for 24 h.\n\nApproximately 10 ml of jugular blood were taken at 24 h after birth and allowed to clot. Serum was separated by centrifugation (3000 x g) and frozen (-20\u00b0C) until analysis for IgG and IgM by radial immunodiffusion (VMRD, Inc.).\n\nWeekly prevalence of infectious organisms was analyzed as a randomized complete block design in a repeated measures analysis of covariance using a general linear mixed models algorithm (2). Body weight at birth was used as a covariable. Terms in the model were block, treatment, block x treatment, week of age, week x treatment, and error. Block x treatment was used as the error term to test effects of treatment, and error was used to test week and week x treatment. Significance was determined at P c .05 unless otherwise noted.\n\nSeven calves died, and 4 calves were stillborn during the experiment (Table 1) . Stillborn calves and 1 calf that died at 3 d of age were replaced; therefore, a total of 90 calves completed the study. Calculated mortality of all calves during the experiment was 10.9% and, of calves born alive, 7.2%. Mortality of 7.2% is less than mortality reported in a recent survey of calf mortality in herds across the US (3). Of the 7 calves that died after assignment to treatment, 5 calves were fed colostrum by nipple-bottle. Serum IgG and IgM concentrations at 24 h were generally low in calves that died, although serum IgG exceeded 30 g/L in 2 calves (Table 1) . Cryptosporidium was shed by 86 calves during the study and was found in 28% of all samples collected. This prevalence (96% of calves) is higher than other reports of prevalence in young calves (10, 13) but similar to a recent survey of dairy herds throughout the US (3). Samples were positive for Crypfosporidium during wk 1 to 4 only. When pooled across wk 1 to 4, prevalence of Crypfosporidium oocysts in feces of calves housed in the barn was greater ( Table 2) , and a significant interaction of housing x colostrum feeding indicated a greater prevalence in feces of calves housed in the barn and fed colostrum in nipple-bottles. Most shedding occurred during the first 3 wk of life. An interaction of period x treatment was significant (P e .Ol) for the prevalence of Cryptosporidium (Figure la) . At 1 wk of age, calves that nursed the dam had a higher prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection than calves removed from the dam and fed colostrum by nipple-bottle. This effect was probably due to earlier exposure of calves to Cryptosporidium from the dam and surrounding environment. The lack of difference between calves housed in the barn or in in-dividual hutches at 1 wk of age suggests that the major source of inoculation was the dam in the 1st wk of life. At 2 wk of age, most calves (n = 68, 76%) shed oocysts; however, shedding was greatest from calves fed colostrum by nipple-bottle and housed in the barn. Shedding of oocysts during wk 3 was greatest when calves were housed in the barn, suggesting that infections later in life were associated with exposure in the barn.\n\nLopez et al. (10) reported that most fecal shedding of Cryptosporidium occurred during the first 24 d of life and was highly related to serum IgG concentrations in calves at 24 h of age. Stepwise multiple regression indicated that age was the primary factor affecting prevalence of Cryptosporidium in our study. Other significant independent variables included housing, mean daily BW gain, and the prevalence of Giardia. However, neither serum IgG nor IgM was significant in predicting prevalence of Cryptosporidium, suggesting that level of transfer of passive immunity did not affect level of infection in this study, in agreement with other reports (7, 19) but in contrast with data of Lopez et al. (10). Prevalence of Giardia was negatively associated with shed- There was no evidence that serum Ig concentrations influenced prevalence of rotavirus. Besser et al. (1) reported that transfer of rotavirus antibody from serum to the intestinal lumen may be important in providing immunity against rotavirus. Because cattle in this study were not immunized against rotavirus prior to parturition, concentrations of colostral antibody may have been insufficient to increase serum titers in calves and to affect prevalence of the virus. Saif and Smith (17) reported that lactogenic immunity (presence of colostral or milk antibodies in the gut lumen) is important for protection against enteric viruses, including rotavirus. Apparently, colostrum feeding for 3 d after birth did not provide sufficient lactogenic immunity to inhibit shedding of rotavirus, as indicated by increased fecal shedding and scours during the first 2 wk of life.\n\nCoronavirus was observed in fecal samples of 13 calves during the study; mean weekly prevalence was 4.3% (SE = 1.1). Coronavirus was observed most frequently during the first 2 wk of age, although some samples were positive for coronavirus at 5 wk ( Figure IC) . Coronavirus, like rotavirus, is widespread in most dauy herds. A lack of treatment effect ( Eimeria shedding occurred only after 4 wk of age ( Figure Id) and was affected by housing type (P .02) and a period x treatment interaction (P < .02). Prevalence of Eimeriu oocysts was greater in feces from calves housed in the barn, particularly during the last week of the study. Few calves housed in hutches shed Eimeria oocysts. Davis et al. (5) also reported that shedding of Eimeria oocysts was reduced when calves were housed in individual outdoor pens in an uncontaminated area. Multiple stepwise regression also identified date of birth as a significant factor affecting prevalence of Eimeria shedding, particularly when calves were housed in the barn. Calves born later in the study had a greater prevalence of Eimeria oocysts in their feces, apparently because of contamination of the barn environment by calves born earlier.\n\nGiardia was observed in fecal samples of 71 calves during the study, and a total of 122 samples (27.1%; SE = 2.1) were positive for Giardia. Prevalence of Giardia pooled across all weeks was greater when calves were allowed to nurse the dam (Table 2) . Because Giardia is transmitted by ingestion of infected feed, water, or feces (lS), allowing the calf to remain in proximity to the dam for 72 h may have increased exposure to Giardia. Fecal excretion of Giardia generally occurred after 2 wk of age (Figure le) , although feces from 1 calf contained Giardia oocysts during wk 1.\n\nStepwise multiple regression indicated that method of colostrum feeding, mean daily BW gain, intake, and date of birth were significant for the prevalence of Giardia. Positive regression coefficients indicated that intake and mean daily BW gain increased as prevalence of Giardia increased; this effect may be related to the establishment of Giardia later in the study when intake and rates of gain increased, but also suggests that prevalence of Giardia did not significantly impair intake or BW gain in this study.\n\nEscherichia coli was isolated from only 174 of 450 samples cultured. Thawing and refreezing of samples during pooling may have contributed to the apparent loss of viability. Three of the 174 samples (1.7%) were positive for K99(F5) antigen, suggesting that enterotoxigenic E. coli did not contribute to the incidence or severity of scours in this study. The observed low prevalence of K99+ E. coli in this herd was similar to that recently reported in a case-control study of veal calves in Canada (22) .\n\nManagement strategies can affect the prevalence of infectious organisms, incidence and severity of scours, growth, and intake in young calves. When the calf was permitted to nurse the dam for 3 d exposure to Cryptosporidium and Giardia increased, although nearly all calves were exposed to Cryprosporidium within 2 wk. Barn housing of calves increased fecal shedding of Eimeria and tended to increase shedding of rotavirus."}
