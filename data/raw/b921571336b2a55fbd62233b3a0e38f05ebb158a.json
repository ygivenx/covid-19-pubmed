{"title": "Antimicrobial lead compounds from marine plants", "body": "Flavones and flavonols (flavusdLatin for yellow) are present in plant and fungi as secondary metabolites and are naturally yellow in color. Chemical structure has a 15-carbon skeleton, with two phenyl rings (A and B) and one heterocyclic ring (C); abbreviated as C6eC3eC6. They are anthoxanthins (flavones and flavonols), ketone-containing polyhydroxy polyphenol compounds. More than 5000 natural flavonoids are studied from flora and fauna, classified according to their chemical structure. Flavonoids have been shown to have a wide range of biological and pharmacological activities such as antibacterial [4] , antiviral, antifungal [5] , antimicrobial, antidiarrheal activities [6] , antiinflammatory [7] , and antioxidant [8] . Flavonoids show antibacterial potency, synergism with antibiotics along with suppression of virulence factors in bacteria [9] .\n\nTerpenoids are organic chemicals derived from terpenes, which can also be termed as modified terpenes, in which either methyl groups are removed or transferred or oxygen atoms are added. Simple terpenoids and unusual terpenoids are found in ample amount in flora growing in marine environment. Isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate condense to produce geranyl pyrophosphate, which is a precursor to all terpenes and terpenoids.\n\nCytochrome P450s modify the structure of terpenes and this property is found to be due to enzymes terpenoid synthase encoded by genes of 17 plant species genomes [10] . Sesterterpenoids, sesquiterpenoids, and meroterpenoids found to be antimicrobial and antiviral are more commonly found in marine environments. Marine sesterterpenoids exhibiting prominent antimicrobial and antiviral bioactivities occur in marine sponges [11] . Seven different types of sesterterpenes sulfates were isolated from tropical sponge belonging to Dysidea sp., of which most were found strong isocitrate lyase inhibitors showing potent antibacterial effect against Bacillus subtilis and Proteus vulgaris [12] .

Terpenes possess 1,4-benzoquinone supposed to be responsible for antimicrobial and antiviral properties. Puupehanol, a novel sesquiterpene-dihydroquinone derivative, and chloropuupehenone and puupehenone are responsible for antifungal activity in marine sponge Hyrtios sp. extract [14] .

Alkaloids are produced by proand eukaryotes and are known to have antimalarial-like quinine and antibacterial-like chelerythrine [28] activities. Marine macroalgae are rich sources of alkaloids, though few marine alkaloids of algal origin like those using phenylethylamine as precursors have been extracted from plants of terrestrial origin. Halogenated alkaloids from green algae (marine specific) and indole derivatives from red algae are specific. Algae of marine origin possess 44 types of alkaloids, 41 indole, 1 naphthyridine, and 1 phenylethylamine derivatives. Halogenated ones possess 25 bromine, 7 chlorine, and 5 sulfur components [29] .\n\nMarine fauna is a rich source of alkaloids, rather unique chemicals that inhibits enzyme enoyl-ACP reductase, a clinically relevant enzyme target from the type II fatty acid pathway of several pathogenic microorganisms.

Tauramamide, lipopeptide from marine bacteria Brevibacillus laterosporus PNG276 [58] along with ethyl ester 3, showed selective inhibitory activity against pathogenic species of Enterococcus. Thiopeptides and depsipeptides are marine bacterial antimicrobial peptides found in Nocardiopsis sp. TP-1161 [59] , possessing a unique aminoacetone group. Unnarmicine A and C, marine depsipeptides from Photobacterium MBIC06485 [60] selectively killed two Pseudovibrio species, commonly existing in marine environment. Hybrid forms of marine peptide polyketide-nonribosomal antimicrobial agents from Myxobacteria have been isolated. One example is halophilic myxobacterium Paraliomyxa miuraensis, producing miuraenamides A and B which are hybrid cyclic polyketide-peptide antimicrobial agents [61] .

Laminaran enhances release of few inflammation mediators, thus being immunostimulatory and antiinflammatory [75] . Laminaran, a marine glycan inhibits both Gram-positive and Gram-negative marine bacteria such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella typhimurium. It prevents HIV virulence by decreasing its adsorption in human lymphocytes, reducing the efficiency of HIV enzyme reverse transcriptase, thus preventing HIV replication and multiplication [76] . b) Alginic acid: It is a marine polysaccharide extracted from brown algae, with a broad spectrum of medicinal, food, biotechnological, and industrial applications [77] .\n\nBrown algae Sargassum wightii species show alginic acid with antioxidant and antiinflammatory activities, reducing many cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and myeloperoxidase enzyme activities, C-reactive protein levels, rheumatoid factor and ceruloplasmin along with lipid peroxidation reduction and enhanced enzyme activity [78] . The antioxidant activity of alginic acid is because of its metal chelating capacity, scavenging of free radicals, reducing tissue ferric ions and enhancing antimicrobial potency [79] . It controls Listeria monocytogenes growth, responsible for serious food infections [80] .\n\n17.1.1.5.2 Sulfated polysaccarides a) Fucoidan: Fucoidan is found in Brown algae. It has a complex structure, with a backbone of alternating a-L-Fuc residues with 3 -and 4 -glycosidic linkages or 3-linked a-L-fucose (Fuc), which case can be replaced by acetyl groups or sulfate groups or Fuc or glycosyl unit side chains [81] , with monosaccharides like Glc, Galactose (Gal), Xylose, Mannose [82] .\n\nBiological activities of Fucoidan are because of its polysaccharide nature, consisting of 3-linked a-L-Fuc units [83] . Fuc units in Fucoidan backbone can occur in a-1, 2 linkage, in addition to a-1, 3, a-1, 4 bonds [84] . Fucoidan has a wide spectrum of applications with reference to its biomedical features [85] . Fucoidan shows antiinflammatory effects, selection inhibition, complement inhibition and enzyme inhibitory activities because of its pleiotropic properties [86] . Three brown algae Sargassum polycystum, Sargassum mcclurei, Turbinara ornate Fucoidan has shown anti-HIV potency, probably due to blocking of first HIV entry steps in target cells [87] . Alga Padina tetrastromatica synthesizes silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with the help of fucoidan as a coating material [88] , which probably increases activity against antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. Antibiotics along with fucoidan in nanoparticles show synergistic effect. Commercially used carrageenans are kappa (k), iota (i) and lambda (l), alias carrageenan 4-sulfate (DA-G4S), carrageenan 2,4-disulfate (DA2S-G4S) and carrageenan 2,6,2-trisulfate (D2S,6S-G2S), respectively (IUPAC) and carrageenans \u0475 and m which ar biological precursors of iand k-carrageenans [90] (Campo et al.) , which show emulsifying, gelling, thickening, stabilizing characteristics which offer protective effects for food [91] , pharmaceutical and cosmetic products [92] .

It is biopolymer and found abundance in marine environment, structurally made up of GlcNAc, GlcN units linked by b-1, 4 glycosidic bonds. GlcNAc is strongly N-acetylated due to the presence of more than 70% of total monosaccharides, decreasing its water solubility. Chitin has 4-linked N-acetyl Glucosamine (GlcNAc 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-b-glucose) units and partly glucosamine, GlcN (2-amino-2-deoxy-b-D-glucose) units. In case of less than 50% GlcNAc content or DA -degree of N-acetylation, the polymer is called Chitosan. Chitosan, a cationic polysaccharide, is made up of repeating units with chitin glycosidic linkages, but less than 50% levels of GlcNAc. Their interactions and hydrophobicity depends on number and positions of acetyl groups [103] . Due to non-toxicity, it can be biomedically applied for special functions like antipathogenic activity [104] , decided by its molecular weight, extent of deacetylation and substitution, pH, length of substituents and their positions in GlcN units [103] .\n\nChNP or Chitosan nanoparticles exhibit antifungal activity [105] .

Chitinase is a marine antifungal polysaccharide from marine South China sea sponge inhibiting Streptomyces sp. DA11. Craniella australiensis exhibited antifungal defense activity for C. albicans and A. niger [141] , which may be because of its microbial symbiont exhibiting chitinase activity bringing about chitin degradation.\n\nThe vastest group of secondary metabolites in plants is the group of phenols.

Other antimicrobial bromophenyl compounds have also been isolated from the marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis INH strain [146] .\n\nAnthraquinones, coumarins, and flavonoids from marine extracts show antimicrobial action. Aspergillus versicolor derived from Petrosia species marine sponge shows five bioactive anthraquinones which exhibited antimicrobial activity for Gram-positive bacteria [147] . Marine-derived 05F16 Aspergillus sp. possesses hexahydroanthrones, tetrahydrobostrycin, and 1-deoxytetrahydrobostrycin [148] showing antibacterial potency for E. coli and S. aureus. Anthraquinone monodictyoquinone A (1,8-dihydroxy-2-methoxy-6-methylanthraquinone) is antimicrobial found in sea urchin fungus Monodictys sp. [149] . Anthraquinone monodictyoquinone A was found in marine ALAA 2000 Nocardia sp., from marine red alga Laurencia spectabilis and exhibited antimicrobial action toward Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. 7-Methylcoumarin and flavonoids, rhamnazin, and cirsimaritin are antimicrobial phenolic compounds from marine Streptomyces [150] .

Many glycosides exhibit various biological activities including antimicrobial.\n\nMarine steroidal glycosides show their presence in microalgae and invertebrates such as echinoderms, soft corals, and sponges [154] . Euryspongia, a marine sponge from Palau, showed two new steroidal sulfates Eurysterols A and B [155] with antifungal potency activity against wild-type and amphotericin B-resistant C. albicans strains.

Marine endophytic fungus Colletotrichum sp. containing ring B aromatic steroids exhibited showed antimicrobial activity against the fungus Microbotryum violaceum, E. coli, and Bacillus megaterium [157] .\n\nThere are various marine originating chemical antimicrobial lead compounds which can be further explored for human health issues. There are currently over 3000 new substances identified from marine organisms in the past three decades, giving researchers a large pool of novel molecules from which to find new compounds to develop [158] .\n\nThey have to be clinically tried out before being implemented for general prescriptions. This requires ample amounts of compounds under trial to be isolated and extracted in pure forms from the source. Obtaining them from invertebrates in sufficient amounts can prove difficult. There are various such compounds that are presently under clinical trials. Aqua culture is an alternative but may not be viable in all cases. Microorganisms may be used as sustainable sources for production of required compounds for production of intermediates in the first step of semisynthesis which can later produce final compound of interest.\n\nIn the era of rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, marine sponge extracts have shown the best antimicrobial potency against terrestrial bacteria [159] . When 101 arctic sponges were antimicrobially screened against opportunistic infections causing bacteria, approximately 10% of them showed significant results, values of IC50 ranging from 0.2 mg/mL to 5 mg/mL [160] . About 800 compounds with antibiotic properties have been isolated and identified from marine sponges [161] . Of 31 sponges checked, 18 showed strong antimicrobial potency against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and are being screened for a range of therapeutically significant substances [162] \n\nNo cure has yet been available for adenovirus serotype 5 (AdV-5) associated with respiratory infections [166] or rotaviruses associated with severe gastroenteritis of animals and humans or diarrhea in immunocompromised patients, which may prove fatal [167] . About 40 antiviral substances from marine species have been reported, half of which have shown prospects in treatment of HIV infection. On this background, marine sponges, sources of novel antivirals, may prove to be good therapeutic agents [168] . Avarol inhibits HIV infection progression and increases humoral immune response. Avarol in 0.3, 0.9 mM concentration inhibited 50%, 80% of viruses, respectively, released by infected cells [169] . Avarol derivatives, 6 0 -hydroxyavarol and 3 0 -hydroxyavarone, strongly inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase in HIV.\n\nAvarol converts viral genomic RNA to proviral DNA and integrates it in host chromosomal DNA [170] . Various antiviral marine metabolites are currently under clinical trial. Examples of antiviral compounds under clinical trials are the following: l 4-Methylaaptamine is an alkaloid from A. aaptos inhibitory toward HSV-1 [38] .\n\nl Papuamides AeD are cyclic depsipeptides from Theonella sp. acting against HIV-1 [171] .\n\nl Ara-A is a nucleoside from Cryptotethya crypta inhibitory toward HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV [172] .\n\nl Avarol is a sesquiterpene hydroquinone from Dysidea avara acting against HIV-1, UAG suppressor glutamine tRNA inhibitor [169] .\n\nl Haplosamates A and B are sulfated steroids from Xestospongia sp. alias Haplosclerida, antiviral (inhibitor of enzyme HIV-1 integrase) in action [173] .\n\nl Dragmacidin F is an alkaloid from Halicortex sp. acting against HIV-1 [174] .\n\nl Hamigeran B, a phenolic macrolide from Hamigera tarangaensis has antiviraleantiherpes and antipolio virus potency [175] .\n\nl Mycalamides AeB are nucleosides from Mycale sp. with anti-A59 coronavirus (HSV-1) action [176] .\n\nl Mirabamides A, C, and D are peptides from S. mirabilis with antiviral (HIV-1) potency [48] .\n\nl FDA-approved vidarabine (Ara-A), Vira-A\u00d2, is a nucleoside Ara-A from marine sponge C. crypta and is an arabinosyl nucleoside, inhibiting synthesis of viral DNA [177] .\n\nl Azidothymidine (zidovudine), Ara-A, acyclovir, Ara-Cemodified semisynthetic arabinosyl nucleosides in use against viruses [178] .\n\nInvasive mycoses, an increasing resistant fungal infection in patients of AIDS, on immunodepressants, with blood cancers, undergoing transplants [179] , have proved fatal. Candida, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and other opportunistic fungi are common culprits. Sponges belonging to Jaspis sp. have given Jaspamide cyclodepsipeptide, a 19-unit macrocyclic depsipeptide, exhibiting in vitro antifungal potency against C. albicans [180] .

A need for new antimalarial compounds led to antimicrobial agents from marine sponges. Cymbastela hooperi has exhibited antimalarial potency against P. falciparum through isonitriles, terpenoid isocyanates, and isothiocyanates [184] . Diacarnus megaspinorhabdosa, a marine sponge exhibited antimalarial potency toward chloroquine-resistant and -sensitive P. falciparum through epidioxy-substituted norsesterterpenes and norditerpene endoperoxides [185] . [185] ).\n\nl Kalihinol A, an isonitrile-containing kalihinane diterpenoid, from Acanthella sp./Halichondrida, with an MIC of 0.0005 mg/mL, against P. falciparum D6 clone [187] .\n\nl Diisocyanoadociane, a tetracyclic diterpene, from C. hooperi, acting against P. falciparum, with an MIC of 0.005 mg/ mL for D6 clone [188] .\n\nl Halichondramide is a macrolide, from P. falciparum, with an MIC of 0.002 mg/mL, against P. falciparum D6 clone [184] .\n\nl Sigmosceptrellin B is a norsesterterpene acid, from Diacarnus erythraeanus, T. gondii, active against P. falciparum D10, with an MIC of 1200 ng/mL [184] .\n\nl (E)-Oroidin is an alkaloid, from Agelas oroides, bioactive against P. falciparum, with an MIC of 0.30 mg/mL for D6 clone [189] .\n\nl Plakortin and dihydroplakortin are cycloperoxidases, from Plakortis simplex, acting against P. falciparum, D10 at 1263-1117 nM [190] .\n\nManzamines are efficient antimalarials from a variety of sponges [191] and have exhibited inhibitory activity against P. falciparum (D6 clone), MIC 0.0045 mg/mL [191] , by increasing host immunity [187] .\n\nNatural products have always played a significant role in drug discovery for treating human diseases. Drugs developed from marine sources have ignited a hope to offer novel mechanisms to fight some of the most debilitating diseases such as HIV, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's, and cancer. Although costs required for developing drugs from marine sources have been exorbitant, development of new technology and better understanding of marine species and associated ecosystem has helped us in developing research in the area of drug development. Bright future awaits pharmaceutical industry for developing new drugs from antimicrobial lead compounds obtained from marine sources. The progress is slow, but surely drug manufacturing units have started showing interest in implementing natural marine sources for drug developing. A future trend is developing in research today, positively toward use of marine natural resources. There are ample of marine lead compounds, more than imagined [192] .\n\nMetabolites derived from marine species such as sponges span wide with respect to their chemical components such as alkaloids, peptides, terpenoids, polyketides, and others, with a variety of antimicrobial and other properties [187] . When these compounds are prepared for the market, they need to have a known chemistry, enhanced bioavailability, and minimized side effects. Manzamines are metabolites from marine sponges that can be potentially used as drugs against tuberculosis [193] , HIV [169] , malaria [184] , and others. Ara-A, ara-C, and acyclovir are a few products originating from marine sponges in clinical use [169] .\n\nIt has been observed that medicines derived from various metabolites and derivatives from marine species such as sponges possess their efficiencies as medicines, based on their doses, qualitative, and quantitative effects of inhibition and their other effects. Besides, they are present in the marine species in very low quantities, which presents difficulties in their being reproduced in ample amounts in the market. Avarol, obtained from sponge D. avara sponge, is an efficient drug for treatment of HIV [169] , which could not be available for studies further than preclinical ones because of its low availability for assessment [194] . Another advantage of marine species metabolites is that their carbon skeletons can be used as carriers or vehicles for generating efficient derivatives. Mankind now faces a challenge of preparing the miracle drugs in large quantities, transforming bioactive metabolites to medicines by selecting proper marine species, isolating the correct metabolite, with its precise action and its target point toward a disease.\n\nAlthough marine environment has umpteen numbers of species which are natural resources for antimicrobial compounds, very few of these secondary metabolites have reached the stage of being approved as drugs, while some metabolites and their derivatives are still under clinical trials or preclinical trials at various stages.\n\nThese trials require a large amount of these metabolites, which has lead to novel ideas like chemically modifying marine natural products or MNPs to transform them into \"druglike\" products, farming organisms in natural environment, and culturing organisms artificially [195] . Preclinical trials need very systematic, detailed pharmacokinetic investigation to tailor MNPs, a challenging task. Antimicrobial efficiency of marine metabolites has shown a promising future for development as human therapeutic agents. A revolution has been set up because of the technique of genome mining for natural product discovery. Technology is being targeted optimally for drug research, its approvals and its launches, for the betterment of human life. This chapter has attempted to give a sketch of antimicrobial lead compounds from marine species, a step forward toward the development of medicinal and biological agents from marine natural sources. This may be an endeavor toward exploring an untrodden path in drug discovery, from marine environment, for the global health benefits of mankind."}
