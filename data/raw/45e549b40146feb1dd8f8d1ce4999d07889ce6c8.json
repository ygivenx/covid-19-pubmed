{"title": "Viral Precursor Polyproteins: Keys of Regulation from Replication to Maturation", "body": "The regulatory mechanisms of viral gene expression vary throughout the virus world. One widely used mechanism employed by evolutionarily divergent RNA and DNA viruses alike organizes multiple genes into a single open reading frame. Most DNA viruses use extensive alternative splicing to express the viral proteins as needed; although, there are exceptions (ex. African swine fever virus [1] ). Almost all retroviruses and RNA viruses use the strategy of translating an open reading frame as a large, precursor polyprotein that is further cleaved by viral or cellular proteases in a highly regulated manner.\n\nViruses that regulate gene expression by polyprotein processing represent an important group including several important human pathogens such as HIV, poliovirus, rhinovirus, Dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, West Nile virus, Chikungunya virus, and SARS coronavirus. Encoding and translating large viral polyprotein precursors is a strategy with many benefits for the virus lifecycle. First, polyproteins allow for a more compact genome by eliminating additional genetic features, such as promoter or enhancer elements, that would be necessary to express each protein individually. Additionally, differential cleavage site usage is coordinated to regulate activity. Lastly, proteins can sometimes perform alternative functions in their precursor forms versus the mature forms.\n\nGiven the wide prevalence of polyprotein processing in many viral families, there are surprisingly few structures of precleavage polyprotein intermediates available. Structure of viral proteins prior to and after cleavage is essential to provide a greater understanding of the regulation, function, and organization of the viral genome. Here we review four recent atomic structures of polyprotein precursors.\n\nAlphaviruses are enveloped viruses of the Togaviridae family whose genome consists of a positive-sense RNA of ~9-11 kb with a 5\u2032 cap structure and 3\u2032 polyadenosine tail ( Figure  1a ). The genome contains two cistrons: the first encodes the viral replication machinery, or nonstructural proteins (nsPs), and the latter contains the structural proteins that form the virion particle. The alphavirus replication machinery is composed of four nonstructural proteins (nsP1 to \u22124), which are expressed as one of two polyproteins (P123 or P1234) caused by read through of an opal codon at the end of nsP3. The non-structural precursor polyproteins are cleaved in a highly regulated manner by a protease at the C-terminus of nsP2 [2, 3] . Shortly after translation of P1234, cleavage at the P3/4 junction occurs either in cis or trans, followed by the P1/2 junction in cis only [3, 4] . Cleavage intermediates P123+nsP4 and nsP1+P23+nsP4 preferentially use the genomic RNA to synthesize a negative-sense, intermediate RNA [5, 6] . The final cleavage event between P23 yields fully mature nsPs and switches the template to the negative-sense RNA to synthesize positivesense genomic and subgenomic RNAs.\n\nThe structure of an uncleaved P23 precursor protein from Sindbis virus spanning the nsP2 protease domain through to the central, zinc-binding domain (ZBD) of nsP3 (P23 pro-zbd ) has been recently determined [7\u2022\u2022] . P23 pro-zbd shows a solvent exposed but inaccessible P2/3 cleavage site located at the base of an 11-13 \u00c5 wide cleft (Figure 1b) [7\u2022\u2022] . The nsP2 protease active site is 40 \u00c5 away from the P2/3 cleavage site, which supports a trans only cleavage mechanism [4,7\u2022\u2022, [8] [9] ]. Attempts to model the nsP2 protease onto the P2/3 cleavage site resulted in steric clashes, indicating accessibility of the cleavage site is highly regulated by an unknown mechanism. P23 has an extensive buried surface area of 3,000 \u00c5 2 due to a ring-shape structure created by nsP3, which encircles nsP2 (Figure 1c ). Several previously described mutations in nsP2 that confer a non-cytopathic phenotype [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] map to the surface of nsP2 and make contact with nsP3, implicating this interaction in viral pathogenesis. During the alphavirus lifecycle, nsP2 localizes to the nucleus; however, the mechanism by which nsP2 dissociates from nsP3 post cleavage is unknown. A potential RNA binding surface, which extends over the surface of both nsP2 and nsP3 has been proposed. It is hypothesized that the RNA binding surface may be altered after cleavage, resulting in the RNA template switching that occurs after P23 cleavage.\n\nPoliovirus is a non-enveloped virus of the Picornaviridae family with a positivesense RNA genome of ~7-9 kb. Poliovirus RNA lacks a 5' cap structure and uses an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) for translation initiation [15, 16] . The genome contains a single, open reading frame encoding both structural and nonstructural genes as a large polyprotein [17] [18] [19] (Figure 2a ). For simplicity, the proteins are grouped into viral capsid proteins (P1), and proteins involved in viral genome replication and protein processing (P2 and P3). Cleavage of the polyprotein is performed by virus-encoded proteases 2A, 3C, or 3CD precursor. 3CD polyprotein is made up of the 3C protease and the viral RNA polymerase (3D) that is responsible for genome replication. The efficiency of 3C protease and 3D polymerase activity is altered depending on the cleavage state. The 3CD polyprotein preferentially cleaves the P1 precursor compared to mature 3C alone [20, 21] while the 3D polymerase activity is inhibited in the precursor [22] . Furthermore, 3CD promotes RNA synthesis by a redistribution of cellular Arf proteins involved in membrane trafficking, an activity not triggered by the cleaved forms [23,24\u2022] . These activities highlight the importance of polyprotein cleavage as a mechanism of gene regulation.\n\nThe atomic structure of 3CD resembles beads-on-a-string with 3C and 3D connected by a flexible, solvent exposed linker region containing the cleavage site [25\u2022\u2022] (Figure 2b) . Overall, the structures of 3C and 3D alone are very similar to their counterparts in the 3CD precursor. In sharp contrast to alphavirus P23, 3C and 3D have no intramolecular contacts. The 3CD structure supports a trans cleavage mechanism due to the location of the protease active site and the cleavage site [7\u2022\u2022,25\u2022\u2022,26] . In the post cleavage structure of 3D, the Nterminal residues fold inward and insert into a binding pocket where they participate in several hydrogen bonding interactions, while these residues are extended in the 3CD structure. The rearrangement of the N-terminal residues of 3D post cleavage is proposed to be the mechanism for activation of the 3D polymerase activity [25\u2022\u2022] . [27] . E interacts with cellular receptors and contains a loop responsible for membrane fusion [27, 28] . M is expressed as a precursor protein, prM, which prevents premature fusion by E and is cleaved by furin during egress to release the pr fragment, resulting in a mature particle. In addition to its role in virion morphogenesis, the prM precursor may assist in proper folding of the E protein [29, 30] . The construct included prM residues 1 through 91, an eight amino acid linker in place of a transmembrane region, E residues 1 through 394, and a mutated furin cleavage site between pr and M. E contains three distinct domains, termed DI, DII, and DIII, with the fusion loop located at the tip of DII [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . The pr peptide has a novel beta barrel fold positioned at the distal end of DII, blocking the fusion loop, consistent with its role in preventing membrane fusion [31\u2022\u2022,38] . Similar inaccessibility of the fusion loop in immature virus has also been described in Chikungunya structural precursor polyprotein p62 (discussed by Vaney, Duquerroy, and Ray in current issue of Current Opinion in Virology) [39\u2022] . Cryoelectron microscopy shows immature flaviviruses at neutral pH have a \"spiky\" appearance, while mature flaviviruses have a \"smooth\" surface [40] [41] [42] [43] . These appearances are altered depending on the oligomeric state of immature prM-E or mature M and E proteins. The hinge angle between DI and DII of E alone is very similar to the hinge angle of the prM-E heterodimer [31\u2022\u2022,37] . However, the difference in the angle between DI and DII in immature versus mature virus is 23\u00b0, which may determine the oligomeric state of E. Fitting the X-ray structure to cryoEM density shows that immature prM-E at neutral pH would prevent furin cleavage of prM due to steric hindrance [31\u2022\u2022] . During egress, immature virions are transported through the trans Golgi Network where exposure to more acidic conditions causes a conformational change in prM-E, allowing furin access to the cleavage site [44] .\n\nThe Retroviridae genome consists of two copies of positive-sense RNA, which is reverse transcribed early during infection. The resulting DNA is inserted into the host genome and used for production of viral RNA and proteins as infection progresses [45] . Retroviruses vary in the number of genes encoded, but they all have at least four open reading frames (gag, pro, pol, and env), which may or may not be in the same reading frame. HIV is a retrovirus whose genome encodes nine (sometimes 10) genes. The gag gene is located at the 5' end of all retrovirus genomes and is translated as a polyprotein precursor containing three distinct domains: matrix (MA), capsid (CA), and nucleocapsid (NC) (Figure 4a ) [46] . The Gag precursor is associated with the inner surface of the cell's plasma membrane, where it participates in forming the immature virion and selectively packaging viral RNA [45] [46] [47] . Cleavage of precursor protein causes mature CA proteins to organize into cone-like structures and ultimately leads to maturation of the virus [48\u2022\u2022] .\n\nTo discern differences between immature and mature virion structures, the NMR structure for the N-terminal portion of immature HIV-1 Gag, including MA and the N-terminal portion of the CA domain (CA N ), was determined (Figure 4b ) [48\u2022\u2022] . Structures of CA N in the immature polyprotein and mature post cleavage form demonstrate that the N-terminus undergoes a disorder to order transition upon cleavage, resulting in the formation of a \u03b2hairpin, while immature and mature MA structures do not show significant changes. Integral residues located in the CA N hairpin region have previously been shown to prevent proper capsid core formation, leading to formation of noninfectious virus [49] [50] [51] . Therefore, cleavage triggers the formation of the \u03b2-hairpin in CA N , and may be responsible for proper capsid core particle assembly.\n\nPresented here are four recent atomic structures of viral polyprotein precursors. Several underlying mechanisms for viral gene regulation can be gleaned from these structures. The first involves accessibility of the polyprotein cleavage site to control the gene's activity, function, and location at specific times post infection. Cleavage of these polyproteins is regulated by different methods. The alphavirus P2/3 cleavage site is solvent exposed but not readily accessible to the protease and the requirement for cleavage is still unknown. Access to the Poliovirus 3CD cleavage site has been postulated to be dependent on the intermolecular scaffolding thought to form between 3CD molecules [25\u2022\u2022] . Cleavage of flavivirus prM-E is regulated by the low pH environment found late in viral egress, preventing immature exposure of the fusion loop. Secondly, cleavage events themselves can cause conformational changes in the newly formed termini of the mature, cleaved protein, permitting new functions post cleavage. The 3D polymerase activity is initiated by inserting the N-terminus of the mature protein into a hydrophobic pocket only after cleavage. The Nterminus of HIV CA undergoes the formation a \u03b2-hairpin, resulting in maturation of the core particle. Further structures regarding virus particle maturation and the involvement of precursor proteins not discussed here can be found for Chikungunya virus p62 [ Viral polyproteins represent a largely unexplored structural aspect of the viral lifecycle, especially those involved viral genome replication. Despite the prevalence of these proteins throughout virus families, very few viral precursor polyprotein structures are currently available. Based on the diversity of the four structures and cleavage site regulation presented here, it is likely that many more regulatory mechanisms are yet to be described. Because of their regulatory roles ranging from genome replication to virion maturation, viral polyproteins will be valuable tools for the design of uniquely targeted drugs. "}
