{"title": "Solution structure of the X4 protein coded by the SARS related coronavirus reveals an immunoglobulin like fold and suggests a binding activity to integrin I domains", "body": "A novel coronavirus (CoV) has been shown to be the etiologic agent of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which affected about 30 countries in late 2002. The viral genome is almost 30 kb in length and contains at least 11 open reading frames, whereas the exact number depends on the strain and the minimal count of coded amino acid residues [1] [2] [3] . Coronaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses that code for the characteristic proteins replicase (R), spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. In addition, SARS-CoV codes for subgroup-specific accessory proteins that are thought to be dispensable for viral replication in cell culture, but may be important for virus-host interactions and thus contribute to the virus' fitness. The important roles of these so-called ''accessory'' proteins for viral infectivity, replication efficiency and pathogenic effects is well established and investigated e.g. for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) accessory proteins [4, 5] , and for Rhinoviruses [6] .\n\nMost SARS-CoV accessory proteins do not reveal significant sequence homologies to proteins with known function. Thus, a possible approach to elucidate potential functions of these proteins may be to determine their three-dimensional structures and search for structural similarities to proteins with known functions.\n\nAs an example of such an approach to SARS-CoV accessory proteins, we and others [7] focused on the X4 protein [1] , also called U122 [7] , coded by a gene with the names ORF7a [8] and ORF8 [2] . ORF8 was suggested to encode a predicted protein of 122 amino acids that has no significant BLAST or FASTA matches to known proteins [2] . X4 is predicted to contain a transmembrane helix comprising residues 99-117. The predicted signal sequence is probably cleaved off between residues 15 and 16. Together these data indicate that X4 is likely to be a type I membrane protein, with the amino-terminal hydrophilic domain (residues oriented inside the lumen of the ER/Golgi or on the surface of the cell membrane or virus particle, depending on the localization of the protein.\n\nRecently, it was shown that X4 is expressed in SARS-CoV-infected cells [7, 9] . In addition, the signal peptide is cleaved in Vero E6 cells transfected with ORF 7a. The carboxy-terminus (KRKTE) represents a functional ER retrieval motif. Experiments to investigate the subcellular localization in Vero E6 cells show that X4 is indeed present in the ER compartment, probably in the ER/Golgi intermediate compartment [9] , the trans-Golgi network and also in small amounts on the cell surface of infected cells [7] .\n\nIt has been shown that an additional SARS CoV accessory protein, namely, X1 (U274, ORF3 or ORF3a), is expressed on the cell surface of SARS-CoV-infected cells [10, 11] and interacts with X4. In addition, X1 has been shown to interact with the SARS-CoV structural proteins E, S, and M [10] .\n\nAnother study on X4 came to the conclusion, that X4 is able to induce apoptosis via the caspase pathway in various cell types [12] . This was speculated to be one of the underlying mechanisms for the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infections.\n\nThese interesting findings and the lack of sequence homology to proteins with known function prompted us to determine the threedimensional solution structure of the X4 ectodomain containing residues 16-99 by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to derive hints for potential functions of X4.\n\nA piece of DNA containing codons 16-99 and an additional carboxy-terminal arginine was obtained by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with six different synthetic oligonucleotides with sequences based on the published amino acid sequence of X4 (Swiss-Prot accession number: P59635) [1, 2] . The oligonucleotide (primer) sequences were adapted for optimal codon usage of highly expressed proteins in E. coli: primer A, CGGAATTCA TATGCTGGAAGTTCTGTTCCAGGGGCCC; primer B, GTTCTGTTCCAGGGGCCCGAAC TGTACCACTACCAGGAATGCGTGCGTGG TACCACCGTGCTGCTGAAAGAACCG; primer C, CGTGCTGCTGAAAGAACCGTGCCC GAGCGGTACCTACGAAGGTAACAGCCCG TTCCACCCGCTGGCGGATAACA, primer D, GTACCATCCGCGCACGCGAACGCGAAGT GGGTGCTGGTGCAGGTCAGCGCGAATTT GTTATCCGCCAGCGGGTGG; primer E, CGG ATGAACAGTTTCGGGCTCACGCTACGCG ACCGCAGCTGGTAGGTGTGACGGGTAC CATCCGCGCACGCGA; primer F, CCGCTC GAGGGATCCTTAACGGCTGTACAGTTCC TGCTGCACTTCTTCCTGACGGATGAACA GTTTCGGGC. Primers A and F contained NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively, for insertion of the finally obtained PCR fragment into the multiple cloning site of pET15b. PCR was performed with Vent-polymerase (New England Biolabs). Three subsequent PCR-reactions were performed in 50 ll volumes: the first with primers C and D for 10 cycles, the second with 1 ll as a template taken from the first reaction and primers B and E for 10 cycles, and finally the third reaction with 1 ll as a template taken from the second reaction and primers A and F for 30 cycles. Annealing temperature for the three reactions were 62, 60, and 58\u00b0C, respectively. The PCR product obtained thereafter, was cleaved with NdeI and BamH1 and inserted into the multiple cloning site of pET15b yielding plasmid pX4e that codes a poly-histidine stretch followed by thrombin and PreScission cleavage sites (MGSSHHHHHHS SGLVPRGSHMLEVLFQGP), followed by residues 16-99 of X4 and a C-terminal arginine and a stop codon. The DNA sequence of the gene coding the poly-histidine tagged X4e protein was confirmed by DNA sequencing.\n\nExpression and purification of the X4 ectodomain Vector pX4e was transformed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) Rosetta cells (Stratagene). The transformed cells were grown at 37\u00b0C to 2 ml of Luria broth (LB) medium plus ampicillin (100 lg/ml) for 5-7 h. The cells were transferred into 50 ml LB-Medium and grown until they reached an OD 600 of about 2, added to 11 LB and grown until they reached an OD 600 of 0.7. Induction of X4e expression was induced with isopropyl b-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 1 mM. After 7-9 h the cells were harvested and frozen at )20\u00b0C. To obtain isotope labelled X4e protein, minimal medium [13] containing 1 g/l 15 N-ammonium chloride, 2 g/l 13 C-glucose, and a vitamin cocktail (5 mg/l thiamine, 1 mg/l biotin, 1 mg/l choline chloride, 1 mg/l folic acid, 1 mg/l niacinamide, 1 mg/l pantothenic acid, 1 mg/l pyridoxal hydrochloride, 0.1 mg/l riboflavin) was used instead of LB.\n\nThe cell pellet of 11 expression culture were resuspended in 50 ml buffer B (6 M GdmHCl, 20 mM tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazol, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0). Cell lysis was carried out at room temperature for about 2 h. After centrifugation the supernatant was filtrated (0.44 lm) and added to a 5 ml nickel-loaded HiTrap chelating HP column (Amersham). The column was washed with 150 ml of buffer B, 100 ml of buffer Wl (6 M GdmCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazol, 1 mM 2mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0), 10 ml buffer W2 (buffer Wl with additional 10 mM imidazol) and 10 ml buffer W3 (buffer Wl with additional 20 mM imidazol). X4e protein was eluted with 20 ml buffer E (6 M GdmCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM Imidazol, 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0).\n\nPoly-histidine tagged X4e protein was dialyzed against buffer A (6 M GdmCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM Sodium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0), and subsequently against buffer D (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM Sodium phosphate, pH 8). The denaturated moiety of the protein was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was dialyzed against 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5, and subsequently diluted 1:4 with buffer F (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7, 1 mM EDTA). The poly-histidine tag was cleaved off with 100 lg PreScission (Amersham) per mg X4e at 4\u00b0C for about 5 h.\n\nThe protease was removed by loading the mixture on a GST-column (2 ml resin; Amersham) equilibrated in PBS and subsequent washing with 6 ml buffer P (10 mM Tris/HCl, 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6). The protein was found in the flow path as well as in the fraction of buffer P. To remove the poly-histidine tag and uncleaved X4e protein, both fractions were loaded on 2 ml nickelloaded nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose resin (Qiagen) equilibrated in buffer P. The column was washed with 20 ml buffer P. The flow path and the protein containing fraction from buffer P were combined and dialyzed against 1 mM Sodium acetate pH 5.\n\nThe pure protein was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentration was determined by absorption at 280 nm using the molar extinction coefficient of X4e of 6640 M )1 cm )1 .\n\nNMR samples contained 0.4 mM protein in 1 mM 2 D 4 sodium acetate, pH 5.0, in 93% H 2 O/7% D 2 O. NMR spectra were recorded at 315 K on Varian Unity INOVA spectrometers equipped with triple-axis pulse-field-gradient (PFG) triple resonance probes and cryogenically cooled Z-axis PFG triple resonance probes at proton frequencies of 600 and 800 MHz. Uniformly 13 C/ 15 N-labelled protein was used for all experiments. The resonance assignment of X4e was obtained using the following experiments: 1 H) 15 N-HSQC, 1 H) 13 NMR Spectra for steady-state 1 H) 15 N NOE and T 2 relaxation time measurements [14] were recorded on 15 N-labelled protein under the same conditions as the other NMR experiments. 1 H) 15 N NOE spectra were collected for sensitivity reasons at 800 MHz on a Varian Unity INOVA spectrometer equipped with cryogenically cooled Z-axis PFG triple resonance probe. Spectra recorded with proton saturation utilized a 1 s recycle delay followed by a 3 s period of saturation, while spectra recorded in the absence of saturation employed a recycle delay of 4 s. T 2 experiments were recorded at 600 MHz on a Varian Unity lNOVA spectrometer with a conventional probe due to concerns about heating during the CPMG period on the cryogenically cooled probe at 800 MHz. T 2 spectra were recorded with a recycle delays of 3 s. Values of the steady-state 1 H) 15 N NOE were obtained from the ratio of peak intensities of spectra recorded with and without proton saturation. Values of T 2 were determined by fitting the measured peak volumes to a single exponential decay curve.\n\nBased on the almost complete assignment of 1 H, 13 C, and 15 N resonances of X4e, a total of 1688 NOE-derived experimental constraints (including 623 long-range distance constraints) could be derived from three-dimensional NOESY spectra in an iterative procedure (Table 1) . NOE analysis and assignment was performed using CARA [15] and ARIA [16] . Interproton distances were used directly to calibrate experimental peaks and to extract distance constraints. Lower and upper bounds for distance constraints were derived from the target distances empirically by estimation of the error as 12.5% of the target distance squared. Distances involving ambiguous constraints, methyl groups, aromatic ring protons and nonstereospecifically assigned methylene protons were treated as sum of separate contributions to the target function, known as ''sum averaging'' [17] . No hydrogen bonds or predetermined secondary structure elements were used as input.\n\nFinal structures were calculated with ARIA using CNS without automatic assignment. The 15 lowest-energy structures out of 100 calculated structures were further refined by a short simulated annealing run in an explicit water shell. Of those, the 10 lowest energy structures that did not show any distance constraint violation of more than 0.03 nm were used for further analysis. Geometry of the structures, structural parameters and secondary structure elements were analyzed and visualized using the programs MOLMOL [18] , PROCHECK [19] and WHATIF [20] . The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, with accession code 1YO4.\n\nProtein expression, purification and structure determination 15 N) 13 C-double-labelled X4 ectodomain (X4e) was prepared as described in the methods part. In the following, numbering of the amino acid residues of X4e is according to the residue's position in the mature protein, e.g. amino acid residue 1 of X4 is coded by codon number 16 of the ORF7a gene. To prepare a sample for NMR spectroscopy, 1.3 mg protein were used to obtain a 400 lM protein solution in 1 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5. Virtually all proton, 15 N, and 13 C resonances were assigned ( Figure 1 ) and deposited in the BMRB data bank (accession code: 6824). Experimental NOE distance constraints were collected from a 13 C-HSQC-NOESY spectrum and in addition from a NOESY) 15 N-HSQC spectrum recorded with a 15 N-labelled sample. Altogether 1974 constraints were used for the final structure calculation using a simulated annealing protocol. The finally obtained structure family consisted often structures that fulfilled the experimental distance constraints with a maximum deviation of less than 0.03 nm (Figure 2a) . The structures were deposited in the PDB data bank (accession code: 1YO4).\n\nResidues 1-65 of the X4 ectodomain form a well defined beta-sandwich fold. Residues 66-84 appear to be unstructured, indicated by decreased heteronuclear 1 H) 15 N-NOE values ( Figure 3 ) and the lack of experimental NOE-derived structural data for this part of the protein. The well structured part of X4e is built up from seven beta-strands so that four strands form one betasheet and three strands form a second sheet (Figure 2b ). The sheets are closely packed or ''sandwiched'' against each other. Each sheet is amphipathic with the hydrophobic side facing inward. The larger four-stranded beta-sheet consists of strands A, G, F, and C, the smaller three-stranded beta-sheet consists of strands B, E, and D. All beta-strands align in anti-parallel fashion, as it is well-known for most immunoglobulin-like domains, with the exception of strand A, which aligns parallel to strand G.\n\nTwo disulfide bonds link both sheets on opposite edges (Figure 2b ) therefore stabilizing the beta-sandwich structure. At the top of the structure, defined by the BC, DE and FG loops [22] , a disulfide bridge between Cys20 (BC loop) and Cys54 (end of the F strand) creates a compact tip in the structure. At the bottom, which is defined by the AB, CD and EF loops, a disulfide bridge links Cys8 at the end of strand A with Cys43 at the end of strand E.\n\nNot surprisingly, the solution structure of residues 1-65 of X4e obtained in the present study is very similar to the X-ray structure reported very recently [7] (Figure 2a) . The overall backbone root mean squared (rmsd) between both structures is 0.11 nm.\n\nThe beta-sandwich domain measures approx. 3.5\u00c22.7\u00c22.0 nm, in which the longest distance corresponds to the top-bottom distance. The AGFC beta-sheet extends along the full height of the structure, whereas the BED beta-sheet is Structural Statistics of the ensemble of X4 structures. a In all structures, ser22 was found in a disallowed region. This may be due to fast local conformational exchange. This may lead to different local conformations that cannot be distinguished on the NMR time scale, which ultimately yields experimental NMR constraints that are in accordance only with a time-averaged structure rather than one of the limit conformations. Although the limit comformations may well be within either one of the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, the average structure does not.\n\nsignificantly smaller and located rather to the bottom of the AGFC beta-sheet. The overall appearance of the seven stranded beta-sandwich fold comprising residues 1-65 of X4e very much reminds one to an immunoglobulin (Ig) like fold. So far, several types of Ig like folds are described [23] . The prototype fold is called ctype with strands A, B, E, and D forming one sheet and strands C, F, and G forming the other sheet ( Figure 4) . A variant, called s-type has a topology with strand D being switched from the ABED sheet to the CFG sheet. This strand is then called C. X4e is a variation of the c-type with the A strand being attached to the CFG sheet. Although, it was already suggested more than 10 years ago to introduce a new subtype for such a topology within the Ig like folds [23] , X4e is to our knowledge the first pure member of that subtype of Ig-like folds. We suggest the name ''p-type'' in accordance with the parallel orientation of A and G strands.\n\nA partial switch of strand A from one sheet (BED) to the other (CFG) is known from some proteins, where strand A is subdivided into A and A\u00a2 with each part of the strand being attached to the BED and CFG sheets, respectively. Examples are the Dl domains of intercellular adhesion molecules ICAM-1 [24] and ICAM-2 [25] . Dl and D2 domains of the IL-1 receptor exhibit a completely switched strand A. Both domains contain, in contrast to X4e, short C\u00a2 strands and were classified as ''c-type'' [26] . In addition, numerous ''v-type'' Ig-like folds are known with a ninestranded beta-sandwich (ABED and GFCC\u00a2C\u00a2\u00a2 where the A strand is completely switched from the BED sheet to the GFCC\u00a2C\u00a2\u00a2 sheet ( Figure 4) . At the top of the BED sheet, the DE loop is protruding from the structure and together with beta-strands C and D delineates a groove on the surface of X4 (Figure 2c ). Central to the groove is the sidechain-carboxyl group of residue Glu 18, contributing a negative charge to the bottom of the otherwise hydrophobic groove. Such a hydrophobic patch on the molecule surface with a central negative electrostatic potential may form a potential site for ligand interaction.\n\nThe very well structured Ig-like domain of X4e comprises all residues from Glu1 to Arg65. The putative membrane-spanning segment of fulllength X4 starts with residue Gln80. Residues Ser66 to Gln79 are flexible and unstructured in the solution structure, which is in accordance with the crystal structure. Although these residues might possibly form a more defined structure in the presence of a lipid bilayer, a potential role of the flexible part may be to allow the Ig-like domain to bind to membrane-distant epitopes of binding partners, or it may be a target for extracellular proteases to allow shedding of X4e. The surface of the X4 lowest energy structure is coloured according the electrostatic potential computed and visualized by the DelPhi module of the Accelrys Insight II molecular modelling system. Regions of basic potential are shown in blue; acidic regions are in red. Surface exposed amino acid residues of particular interest are labelled. Please note, that numbering of the amino acid residues of X4e is according to the residue's position in the mature protein, e.g. amino acid residue 1 of X4 is coded by codon number 16 of the ORF7a gene. Figures were prepared and secondary structure elements identified using MOLMOL [18, 21] .\n\nAs was already found by others [2] , X4 does not show any significant sequence homology to other proteins in the data bases. Therefore, no obvious function of X4 could be derived from any sequence similarity to proteins with known function. Structure based predictions of functions on the basis of similarities to proteins with known functions have been successfully used in the past [45] [46] [47] [48] , and such kind of approach is a major driving force for structural genomics projects.\n\nIn order to identify potential functions of X4 we used the solution structure to search for proteins with similar three-dimensional structures applying the tools DALI [27] and VAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/VAST/vastsearch.html).\n\nEmploying DALI, we compared the solution structure of X4e with known structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The best hit with a high reliability indicating Z-score of 4.8 is the Dl domain of ICAM-2. The structures of ICAM-2 and X4e can be aligned with each other yielding an rmsd of 0.20 nm based on 59 C a -carbon coordinate pairs ( Figure 5 ). Another interesting hit appeared to be the D1 domain of the IL-1 receptor with a Z-score of 3.9. Both structural similarities of X4e were already found using the X4e crystal structure and DALI [7] .\n\nUsing the X4e solution structure for a VAST search revealed the Dl domain of ICAM-1 to be most similar to X4e with an rmsd of 0.18 nm based on 59 C a -carbon coordinate pairs ( Figure 5 ). ICAM-1 is very similar to ICAM-2 in respect to structure and amino acid sequence.\n\nICAM-1 and ICAM-2 are cell adhesion molecules expressed on the surface of cells, especially on endothelial cells after cytokine-mediated stimulation at inflammatory sites [28] . ICAMs belong to a subset of Ig-like superfamily proteins, which are specialized for binding to integrins. Integrins in general are non-covalently associated a=b heterodimeric transmembrane proteins, which are involved in adhesive cell-cell-interactions. ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 are known to specifically interact with lymphocyte-function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1, CD11a/CD18, a L b 2 -integrin) that is expressed mainly on lymphocytes. ICAM LFA-1 interactions play a crucial role in lymphocyte attachment and homing to inflammation sites [29] . The ICAM-1 binding site on LFA-1 is the 180 residue containing I-domain of the a L subunit and the binding interface is well described [30] .\n\nX4 aligns structurally very well with Dl domains of ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 ( Figure 5 ). The most obvious differences in the structural alignment are the shortened b-strands and the corresponding BC, DE and FG loops at the top of the structure. The only topological difference between both ICAM Dl domains and X4e is . 2D topology diagrams of observed beta-sheet formation in various Ig-like folds based on the topology subtyping of Bork and co-workers [23] . Strands are labelled in alphabetical order from N-to C-terminus. Affiliation of each strand to either one of the two sheets is indicated by grey or black filling. Please note, that not all subtypes are shown.\n\nb-strand A, which is splitted between the b-sheets in the ICAMs, but is completely aligned to the CFG sheet in X4. Another striking difference is the somehow different location of the disulfide bonds in both ICAMs and X4e.\n\nThe structure-based sequence alignment of X4 with ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 D1 domains shows little sequence identities among the proteins ( Figure 6 ). However, the key residue for LFA-1 interaction of ICAM-1 and ICAM-2, Glu34 and Glu37, respectively, is present in X4 at the homolog or analog sequence position (Glu26), which is the last residue of b-strand C. This glutamic acid residue in the ICAM-1 Dl domain forms a direct coordination to the Mg 2\u00fe ion of the metal-ion dependent association site (MIDAS) in the LFA-1 I-domain [30] . A further characteristic feature of the I-domain binding site in ICAM-1 is a ring of hydrophobic residues around this glutamate residue (Pro36, Tyr66, Met64, and the aliphatic portions of Gln62 and Gln73) [30] . This feature can be also found in X4e, where Glu26 is surrounded by a ring of hydrophobic residues, too. (Figure 2c ).\n\nTo our knowledge, besides the a L subunit of LFA-1, no other cellular binding partner for the . Secondary structural elements and sequence numbering of the X4 ectodomain is shown above the sequences, secondary structural elements of ICAM-2 and sequence numbering of ICAM-1 is shown below the sequences. The sequence alignment is based on spatial proximity (cut-off distance 0.5 nm) in the structural superposition of all three structures. The alignment was prepared using UCSF Chimera [31] and ALSCRIPT [32] .\n\nDl domain of ICAM-1 is known so far. I-domains of a M integrin subunits are known to bind ICAM-1, but via its D3 domain [33] . Weak binding capabilities for ICAM-1 are further reported for a X subunits [34] , but presumably not via its Dl domain [35] . For a D integrin subunits it was shown that they do not bind ICAM-1 [36] .\n\nThe relevance of the very obvious structural similarity of X4e with ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 Dl domains is hard to estimate. But based on this structural similarity and the described common features of amino acid sequence and surface appearance of X4 with the well characterized a L integrin I domain binding site on ICAM-1 D1, we suggest that X4 contains a binding site for the a L integrin subunit I-domain of LFA-1. Although, experimental data will be needed to confirm the prediction, we carried out a modelling study on X4 and the a L integrin subunit I-domain of LFA-1. Interestingly, the resulting complex did not show obvious steric problems to be formed (Figure 7) .\n\nThe consequences of a predicted LFA-1 binding activity of X4 depend largely on the subcellular localization of X4 in infected cells or virus particles. In the following, we speculate on potential functions of X4 as a LFA-1 binding protein dependent from X4 subcellular localization based on examples from other proteins with known functions.\n\nThe presence of LFA-1 binding X4 molecules on the virus surface would allow the virus to use LFA-1 as a receptor for cell entry. Such an example is known from HIV-1, of which virus particles were found bearing incorporated hostencoded ICAM-1 on their surface, which leads to a 5-to 10-fold increase in infectivity, caused by an interaction between virally incorporated ICAM-1 and cell surface LFA-1 [37]. So far, however, there are no reports on positive detection of X4 in virus particles.\n\nX4 was already described to be primarily located in the ER of infected cells and to contain an ER retention signal [9] . If X4 is able to bind LFA-1 it could prevent delivery of newly synthesized LFA-1 molecules from the ER to the cell surface. Prominent examples of viral accessory proteins with such functions are known from other viruses, e.g. HIV-1 Vpu binds to CD4 and prevents CD4 delivery to the cell surface and induces even its degradation [38, 39] . LFA-1 is exclusively expressed on the surface of leukocytes including T cells and dendritic cells. It mediates several adhesive interactions between cells of the immune system, e.g. dendritic cells and T cells, B cells and T cells, T cells and their target cells, as well as the interactions of leukocytes with the endothelium and the transendothelial migration of leukocytes [40] . Loss of LFA-1 leads to severe defects of the immune system as can be seen in the leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) syndrome [41] .\n\nOne study reported small amounts of X4 on the surface of infected cells [7] . The presence of X4 with LFA-1 binding activity on the surface of infected cells could for example interfere with T cell homing, or increase the infected cells' affinity for leukocytes, and could even induce apoptosis in LFA-1 presenting T cells. Leukotoxin from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is an example of a protein that is expressed on the surface of infected cells, binds to LFA-1 on T cells, and induces apoptosis via caspase-3 dependent pathways in these cells [42] . Indeed, overexpression of X4 in Vero E6 cells induces apoptosis via a caspase-3 dependent pathway [12] . Whether LFA-1 is involved in the mechanism, however, is not known.\n\nLymphopenia is a common observation among SARS patients [43] . CD4 + cells are more affected than CD8 + cells. The reason for the lymphocyte depletion is not known. Interestingly, AIDS patients are characterized by a CD4 + depletion. It is suggested that the disappearance of CD4 + T cells in the blood is the result of increased migration of CD4 + cells from the blood into tissues. Secondary signals through homing receptors received during the homing process induce many of these cells into apoptosis [44] .\n\nA second site suitable for a protein-proteininteraction is suggested by the X4e similarity to the second best hit for structural similarity from VAST and DALI searches, namely the domain Dl of the IL-1 receptor. Dl and D2 domains of the IL-1 receptor are of the Ig-like fold with a switched strand A, like X4, but in contrast to X4 contain a short strand C\u00a2. The similarity between X4e and Dl domain of IL-1 receptor is largely based on the switched strand A and the resulting low rmsd value for the majority of C a -coordinates of both protein domains. The sequences of both domains did not reveal the slightest similarity. An interesting feature of the IL-1 receptor Dl domain, however, is the ridge between strands A and B forming the binding site for interleukin-1. Such a [30] (PDB code: 1MQ8). SARS CoV X4 protein was superimposed to ICAM-1 based on protein backbone coordinates of structurally aligning residues of the potential binding interface, comprising b-strands C, D and F, and the CD loop. Sidechain torsion angles of Glu26 were adjusted for steric reasons. The model was prepared using UCSF Chimera [31] . ridge can be found in X4e, as well, and was already described for the X-ray structure of X4e [7] .\n\nTaken all data together, the ectodomain of the SARS CoV coded X4 protein adopts an Ig-like fold, that shows some features resembling those of the Dl domain of ICAM-1. Based thereon, we predict X4 to have a LFA-1 binding activity. Several observation from SARS patients correlate well with such an activity coded in the SARS CoV genome. In any case, an investigation of the page proposed binding potential of X4 to bind LFA-1, may help to elucidate the role of X4 in replication and pathogenesis of SARS CoV."}
