{"title": "Using a Pan-Viral Microarray Assay (Virochip) to Screen Clinical Samples for Viral Pathogens", "body": ". Using the Virochip, we have identified the full spectrum of viruses associated with respiratory infections, including cases of unexplained critical illness in hospitalized patients, with a sensitivity equivalent to or superior to conventional clinical testing [2] [3] [4] [5] . The Virochip has also been used to identify novel viruses, including the SARS coronavirus 6, 7 , a novel rhinovirus clade 5 , XMRV (a retrovirus linked to prostate cancer) 8 , avian bornavirus (the cause of a wasting disease in parrots) 9 , and a novel cardiovirus in children with respiratory and diarrheal illness 10 . The current version of the Virochip has been ported to an Agilent microarray platform and consists of ~36,000 probes derived from over ~1,500 viruses in GenBank as of December of 2009. Here we demonstrate the steps involved in processing a Virochip assay from start to finish (~24 hour turnaround time), including sample nucleic acid extraction, PCR amplification using random primers, fluorescent dye incorporation, and microarray hybridization, scanning, and analysis.\n\nThe video component of this article can be found at http://www.jove.com/video/2536/\n\nThe steps of the Virochip assay include (1) nucleic acid extraction from clinical samples, (2) reverse transcription of extracted RNA and 2 nd strand cDNA synthesis, (3) PCR amplification of randomly primed cDNA, (3) Cy3 fluorescent dye incorporation, (4) hybridization of labeled material to the Virochip microarray, and (5) scanning and analysis ( Figure 1 ). The protocol shown below will demonstrate the use of the Virochip assay on a nasal swab sample from a child with an influenza-like illness.\n\nPrimer A 5'-GTTTCCCAGTCACGATA-(N 9 )-3' Primer B 5'-GTTTCCCAGTCACGATA-3' "}
