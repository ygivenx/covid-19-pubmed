{"title": "Mucin 4 Protects Female Mice from Coronavirus Pathogenesis", "body": "context of SARS-CoV pathogenesis (Gralinski et al., 2015) . The CC panel contains mouse lines 27 derived from a funnel breeding scheme of eight founder strains, including 5 traditional lab 28 strains and 3 wild-derived strains (Churchill et al., 2004; Collaborative Cross Consortium, 2012; 29 UNC Systems Genetics Core Facility, 2012) . This population takes advantage of naturally-30 occurring genetic polymorphisms to capture approximately 90% of the common genetic diversity 31\n\nwithin Mus musculus, and that diversity is distributed evenly throughout the genome, with 32 elevated minor allele frequencies compared to standard natural populations (Aylor et al., 2011; 33 Yang et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2011 ). Our initial screen within an incompletely 34 inbred set of CC mice (the preCC screen) (Gralinski et al., 2015) , along with an F2 screen 35 utilizing a highly resistant and highly susceptible CC mouse line (Gralinski et al., 2017) , 36 identified nine quantitative trait loci (QTLs) impacting SARS-CoV disease. Among these QTLs 37 was locus HrS2 on chromosome 16, which was identified as modulating SARS-CoV titer levels 38 in the lung (Gralinski et al., 2015) . 39\n\nHere, we narrow the HrS2 locus to a priority candidate gene, mucin 4 (Muc4), via the 40 integration of sequence data from the CC founders (Keane et al., 2011) and RNA expression 41 results from our preCC experiment. Low expression of Muc4 in mice containing the PWK/PhJ 42 allele corresponded with the low SARS-CoV titer associated with the QTL located at locus HrS2. 43\n\nWe subsequently examined infection of mice lacking Muc4, predicting reduced viral load. 44\n\nHowever, our findings suggest that while Muc4 does not regulate SARS-CoV titer, it does have 45 broad activity attenuating the pathogenic impact of viral infections. 46\n\nSelection of Muc4 as a SARS-CoV disease associated gene 48\n\nIn earlier studies, incipient CC lines were used to identify four QTLs associated with 49 SARS-CoV phenotypes in female mice, one of which was mapped on the basis viral titer in the 50 lung at four DPI (Gralinski et al., 2015) . A subsequent study utilizing both male and female F2 51 mice derived from a highly susceptible and highly resistant CC mouse line identified five more 52 SARS-CoV-associated QTLs, three of which were mapped at least partially on the basis of viral 53 titer (Gralinski et al., 2017) . Located on chromosome 16 from nucleotides 31,583,769-54 36,719,997, the pre-CC QTL accounted for 22% of the variation in viral titer, which ranged from 55 over 10 8 PFU/lobe to below the limit of detection (10 2 PFU/lobe). The F2 QTLs, by comparison, 56\n\nwere located on chromosomes 18, 7, and 12 and explained 12.9%, 12.3%, and 5.4%, 57 respectively, of the observed variation in titers from high 10 2 to low 10 7 PFU/lobe. Thus, while 58 SARS-CoV titer in the lung is clearly influenced by multiple host genetic factors, the preCC QTL 59 on chromosome 16 was chosen for candidate gene selection and validation. Analysis of allele 60 effects revealed that the founder PWK/PhJ was the main driver of low SARS-CoV titer in the 61 lung ( Fig. 1A) , and PWK/PhJ also had lower titers than any other founder strain at four DPI 62 (Gralinski et al., 2015) . We therefore used private SNPs or In/Dels found in PWK/PhJ to reduce 63 the potential targets in the QTL to seven ncRNAs and 74 genes for downstream analysis. 64\n\nTo prioritize the list of ncRNAs and genes within the QTL, the relationship between RNA 65 transcript levels and viral titer in the lung was examined. Sixty seven preCC mice had both 66 microarray and titer data available, of which sixty had titers above the limit of detection 67 (Gralinski et al., 2015) . Of the 74 candidate genes, 54 had one or more probes on the 68 microarray (Table S4) Table S5 ). Using 70 infection data from the founder mice, Muc4 RNA expression levels mimicked the allelic effects 71 of the QTL with PWK/PhJ mice exhibiting low Muc4 RNA levels (Fig. 1C ). Other potential 72 targets included Lrrc33, Sec22a, Parp14, and Ildr1; however, these genes either have little 73 known linkage to viral replication and the immune response (e.g., Lrrc33, Sec22a, and Ildr1) or 74 the directionality of the correlation did not support their relationship to viral titer in the lung 75 (Parp14). For Muc4, high levels of expression at mucosal surfaces and in various human 76 cancers have been reported (Andrianifahanana et al., 2001; Chaturvedi et al., 2008; Kamikawa 77 et al., 2015) . In addition, Muc4 plays a role in cell and anti-apoptotic signaling (Chaturvedi et al., 78 2008; Funes et al., 2006; Moniaux et al., 2007) . Together, the data suggest that Muc4 may play 79 a role in viral titers at day 4 post SARS-CoV infection. 80\n\nMuc4 drives sex-based difference in weight loss 81\n\nTo examine the role of Muc4 during SARS-CoV infection, we utilized Muc4 -/mice 82 (Rowson-Hodel et al., 2018) which have no gross differences in behavior, overall health, size, or 83 lung function, the latter phenotype measured by plethysmography. Muc4 -/and WT control mice 84\n\nwere infected with SARS-CoV and examined over a four-day time course. Following infection, a 85 significant sex-based difference in weight loss between Muc4 -/and WT mice was observed 86 (Table S3) . Female Muc4 -/and control were essentially indistinguishable through two DPI (Fig.  87 2A). However, infected Muc4 -/females continued to lose weight through day four, with 42% (6 88 of 14) meeting euthanasia requirements (\u226520% weight loss) and another 42% (6 of 14) requiring 89 increased observation (\u226510% weight loss). In contrast, the WT mice held static between days 90 two and three and began to recover by day four, with no mice meeting the requirements for 91 euthanasia and only 13% (2 of 15) requiring increased observation by a margin of \u22640.1g. This 92 Muc4-driven difference in weight loss was not observed in male mice following infection with 93 SARS-CoV (Fig. 2B) . 94\n\nMuc4 has minimal impact on viral load 95\n\nNext, the impact of Muc4 -/on SARS-CoV viral load was measured. Lung lobes from 96 male and female Muc4 -/and WT mice were harvested at two DPI, an acute timepoint previously 97 associated with high SARS-CoV titer (Sheahan et al., 2008) , and at four DPI, the timepoint at 98 which the QTL on chromosome 16 was mapped (Gralinski et al., 2015) . Surprisingly, despite 99 trends for higher mean viral loads in Muc4 -/mice on day 2 and day 4, virus titers were not 100 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Similarly, despite differences in 101 weight loss, viral titer in the lung also exhibited no sex effect (Table S3) . Given the distribution 102 of Muc4 in mucosal surfaces, viral load was further interrogated with IHC to determine whether 103\n\nMuc4 might impact viral tropism in a way not readily determined by the measurement of 104 infectious virus per lobe. Upon examining SARS-CoV antigen staining, however, no significant 105 differences in antigen distribution were noted between Muc4 -/and WT mice in either airway or 106 parenchymal staining ( Fig. 3B and 3C ). Together, the results indicated that the loss of Muc4 had 107 minimal impact on SARS-CoV viral load or distribution. female Muc4 -/mice as compared to female WT mice. In contrast, male Muc4 -/mice induced 116 similar damage to male WT mice (Table S1) . 117\n\nTo further evaluate damage to the lung following infection, whole body plethysmography 119 was utilized to examine changes in pulmonary function (Fig. 5 ). Using only females, both WT 120 and Muc4 -/mice were challenged with a lower dose (10 4 PFU) to ensure their survival over the 121 full six day time course required to observe the onset, peak, and recovery of disordered lung 122 function following SARS-CoV challenge in mice (Menachery et al., 2015a) . Examining airway 123 resistance (penH), the time to peak expiratory flow relative to total expiratory time (rPEF), and 124 mid-tidal expiratory flow (EF50), all three measurements had statistically significant differences 125 between SARS-CoV-infected and mock-infected mice within the Muc4 -/and WT groups 126 (Supplementary Table S3 ). However, no Muc4-dependent differences in either penH (Fig. 5A ) 127 or rPEF (Fig. 5B ) were observed following SARS-CoV infection. In contrast, while not reaching 128 statistical significance, EF50 trended higher in the Muc4 -/mice as compared to WT mice, 129 peaking at day three post-infection (Fig. 5C) . These results show a shift in the early breathing 130 curve in Muc4 -/mice with more rapid exhalation and more labored breathing. These findings 131 may have been exacerbated with the original, higher dose, but that experiment was precluded 132 by the limited survival of Muc4 -/mice. Overall, the whole body plethysmography data indicate 133 more difficult breathing for female Muc4 -/mice relative to their WT counterparts following 134\n\nChanges in the cytokine and chemokine responses following infection of Muc4 -/and WT 137 mice were evaluated at two days post infection. While not significant when adjusted for multiple 138 comparisons (Table S3) , key inflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL6 had 139 WT mice, which may contribute to observed differences in pathogenesis. 144\n\nBecause Muc4 modulated SARS-CoV susceptibility independent of viral replication, a 146 cross-platform validation study was undertaken to begin assessing whether the Muc4 had 147 widespread importance in viral pathogenesis.

Importantly, 149\n\nMuc4 has been detected in synovial sarcomas in humans, thus presenting a novel tissue Screening genetically diverse mouse models provides an opportunity to identify natural 163 variation in novel factors which drive viral disease responses. These studies can also provide 164 therapeutic, prophylactic and molecular insights into emerging pathogens, which are difficult to 165 study during the context of an outbreak. Here, prior phenotypic QTL analysis, bioinformatics, 166\n\nand RNA expression analysis were leveraged to identify Muc4 as a high priority candidate gene 167 driving differences in SARS-CoV titer. Utilizing a Muc4 knockout mouse, a role was confirmed 168 for the gene in augmented SARS-CoV pathogenesis. While virus titers trended higher in Muc4 -/-169 mice at day 2 and 4, there was no statistically significant change as compared to WT control 170 mice. However, in absolute terms the Muc4 -/mice did have a modest 62% higher titer on day 171 two and a 51% higher titer on day four as compared to WT, and it is possible that this difference 172 is biologically significant despite the lack of statistical significance as determined by p-value 173 .

In addition, the loss of Muc4 was linked to enhanced 174 CHIKV disease in vivo. Together, this study highlights both the utility and the challenges in 175 transitioning from QTL hits to single-molecule studies. Our initial hypothesis for Muc4 to play a 176 role in controlling virus replication proved incorrect, or, at the very least, substantially more 177 complex than a simple, direct correlate; however, our exploration found a disease-interaction 178 that played a role in pathogenesis across multiple viruses. 179\n\nOutside of human GWAS studies, where recombination rates are high, it has long 180 proven a challenge to go from a QTL to individual candidate genes (Brown et al., 1997) . Even 181 with novel bioinformatic approaches, in the absence of large genomic deletions (Ferris et al., 182 2013) , fortuitously gene-poor regions (Gralinski et al., 2015) , or previously identified functions 183 (Gralinski et al., 2017) candidate gene identification continues to be difficult. In this manuscript, 184\n\nwe built a framework to integrate knowledge about the preCC genome sequences and a partner 185 microarray dataset to narrow a QTL region down to a likely candidate based on expression 186\n\ncorrelations. Muc4 exhibited strong correlation data and low expression in the relevant founder 187 strain. Additionally, Muc4 is known to play a role in anti-apoptotic signaling (Chaturvedi et al., 188 2008; Funes et al., 2006; Moniaux et al., 2007) , analysis of published microarray data 189 (Jonckheere N et al., 2012) reveals that cells lacking Muc4 express lower levels of interferon-190 stimulated genes (Menachery VD, 2014) , and the related mucin Muc1 is both anti-apoptotic and 191\n\nanti-inflammatory (Kato K et al., 2014; Li Y et al., 2010; Ueno K et al., 2008) . We chose Muc4 192 as our priority candidate gene for follow up, with the initial hypothesis that Muc4 suppressed 193 apoptosis and possible the interferon response, and that its absence in a Muc4 -/mouse would 194 therefore lead to increased apoptosis and inflammation, thereby inhibiting Our validation utilized a Muc4 -/mouse and confirmed a role for Muc4 in protection from 197 SARS-CoV-and CHIKV-induced disease and pathogenesis.

Furthermore, epidemiological data from both SARS-CoV and 224 SARS-CoV-2 indicate that human females may be more resistant than human males (Chen et 225 al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Karlberg et al., 2004; Leong et al., 2006) \n\nMuc4 transcription in a tissue-specific manner (Lange et al., 2003) , offering a potential 227 mechanism as to the greater impact of Muc4's absence in female mice.

Although speculative, it is possible that Muc4 functions not to modulate local viral 244 replication, but rather to limit disseminated disease. Clearly, more studies are needed to 245 unravel these complex interactions. 246\n\nOverall, this research demonstrates that Muc4 is a novel regulator of viral pathogenesis.
