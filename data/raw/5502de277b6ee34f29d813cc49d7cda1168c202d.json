All assays were performed in three replicates.\n\nThe XBP1 splicing was checked by RT-PCR using forward primer (Fig. 1C) . Therefore, PKR may contribute 340 to the activation eIF2\u03b1-ATF4-CHOP pathway during NDV infection.\n\nCHOP promotes NDV-induced apoptosis by reducing the level of anti-apoptotic 342 protein BCL-2 and MCL-1 343 We have reported that NDV infection induces both intrinsic and extrinsic 344 apoptosis, and the extrinsic apoptosis is mediated by induction of death ligands, such 345 as TNF-\u03b1 and TRAIL (44). Whether CHOP is involved in NDV-induced intrinsic 346 apoptosis? It has been known that CHOP promotes mitochondria mediated apoptosis 347 via down-regulation of the pro-survival BCL-2 family (24, 51). Thus, it will be 348 interesting to check whether the expression level of BCL-2 family is regulated by 349 NDV infection. Western blotting analysis showed that pro-survival BCL-2 and 350 MCL-1 were gradually decreased by 0 to 0.5-fold from 16 to 24 h.p.i in NDV-infected 351 HeLa cells ( Fig. 2A) . However, BCL-xL remained relatively stable along the infection 352 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Moreover, the pro-apoptotic BH3 only proteins BIM and PUMA, the pore forming protein BAX and BAK, kept in steady level ( Fig. 2A) . The To confirm above observation, we next adopted the transient overexpression 377 approach. A plasmid encoding the full-length human CHOP with Flag tag at the N 378 terminus was constructed. HeLa cells were transfected with the construct or vector 379 control (PXJ40F) for 24 h before being infected with NDV for 16 h. As shown in Fig.   380 2D, the successful expression of Flag-CHOP was detected with Western blotting using 381 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, the virus yield in culture medium was also 386 increased (Fig. 2E ). The experiment was performed multiple times and reproducible.\n\nTaken together, these data further demonstrate that CHOP promotes apoptosis via 388 down-regulation of BCL-2 and MCL-1, and helps NDV proliferation. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/300129 doi: bioRxiv preprint phospho-JNK (34.5-to 120-fold) and phospho-p38 (1.7-to 23.9-fold) at 12-24 h.p.i. 411 were detected in NDV-infected cells, both of which were almost undetectable in 412 mock-infected cells. Above results reveals that NDV infection moderately activates 413 pro-survival AKT and ERK1/2, and greatly stimulates pro-apoptotic JNK and p38 414 signaling at late infection stage.\n\nTo study whether CHOP is involved in regulation of above signaling cascades, 416 CHOP was either knocked down or overexpressed in HeLa cells, followed by NDV in NDV-induced apoptosis and virus proliferation, we used siRNA to specifically 517 knock down XBP1 in HeLa cells, followed with NDV infection. As expected, the 518 expression of XBP1s was successfully knocked down by siXBP1, and XBP1u was 519 moderately decreased (Fig. 5H) . Interestingly, transfection of siXBP1 resulted in 520 0.5-fold decrease of NP synthesis, compared to those in sic transfected cells (Fig. 5H ). 521 author/funder. All rights reserved.

JNK promotes apoptosis 531 either by directly regulating the apoptotic proteins activity or activating the 532 transcription factor for pro-apoptotic protein (69). We have shown that JNK was 533 phosphorylated at late stage of NDV infection (Fig. 3A) , and CHOP promotes this 534 activation (Fig. 3B, 3C) . We next asked whether IRE1\u03b1 was involved in NDV-induced 535 JNK activation. HeLa cells were transfected with siIRE1\u03b1 or sic before being infected 536 with NDV, and the phosphorylation level of JNK was examined by Western blotting. (Fig. 6D) . Accordingly, in SP600125 558 treated cells, NP mRNA was also greatly decreased, compared to that in 559 DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 6E) . Meanwhile, inhibition of JNK kinase activity reduced 560 the cleavage of PARP by 0.7-fold (Fig. 6D) . Moreover, the transcription of death 561 ligand TNF-\u03b1 and cytokines IFN-\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 was markedly suppressed in SP600125 562 treated cells, as evidenced by semi-quantitative real time RT-PCR (Fig. 6E) . To 563 validate above results, specifically knock down of JNK by siRNA was performed. As 564 shown in Fig. 6F , JNK was successfully depleted by siJNK (0.05-fold), which 565 significantly reduced the level of viral NP expression (0.3-fold), compared to that in 566 sic control cells. PARP cleavage was also greatly decreased by 0.3-fold (Fig. 6F ).\n\nAccordingly, NP, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA was also suppressed by in JNK 568 depletion cells (Fig. 6G ). Collectively, above results demonstrate that activation of 569 JNK promotes virus proliferation and virus-induced apoptosis/inflammation. "}
