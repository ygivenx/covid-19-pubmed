{"title": "Outbreaks of Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and Seasonal Influenza A (H3N2) on Cruise Ship", "body": "We defined a confirmed influenza A case as illness in a cruise A passenger in whom influenza A virus was detected by NAT during the cruise or within 7 days after disembarkation (regardless of symptoms). A case of pandemic influenza was defined as illness in a person with positive RT-PCR results for that virus. Further subtyping was conducted for 44 of 100 patients with positive influenza A but negative pandemic influenza virus results by NAT; all had positive results for seasonal influenza virus. Consequently, we defined a case of seasonal influenza as illness in a person with positive influenza A virus results by NAT but negative pandemic influenza virus results and in whom influenza subtyping for seasonal influenza virus by RT-PCR either produced positive results or was not conducted. A primary case was defined as illness in the first person in a cabin to report ILI symptoms; a co-primary case, as illness in a person who reported symptom onset within 24 hours after a primary case; and a secondary case, as illness in a person whose symptoms developed >24 hours after symptom onset in the primary case-patient. Case-patients were considered infectious for 24 hours before and 7 days after symptom onset. For the childcare center investigation, children who remained asymptomatic throughout the cruise were considered susceptible to influenza infection at each childcare session attended. Children in whom ILI developed were considered susceptible before the infectious period began.\n\nWe obtained a list of the names, sex, dates of birth, nationality, contact details, and cabin numbers of all passengers and crew members on cruise A. We reviewed the cruise ship\u2019s medical records to find passengers who had sought treatment for ILI during cruises A and B. Isolated symptomatic passengers from cruise A were referred to nearby hospitals for testing. Quarantined asymptomatic passengers were asked to report if symptoms developed; if so, laboratory testing was conducted. Crew members and passengers on cruise B were asked to immediately report fever or respiratory symptoms to medical staff and were tested for influenza by at least 2 point-of-care tests taken >24 hours apart. In all 8 Australian states and territories, public health legislation requires diagnostic laboratories to report confirmed influenza cases to the jurisdictional health department (7). The names of influenza case-patients reported after completion of cruise A were checked against the ship\u2019s manifest.\n\nBecause the investigation was part of a public health control initiative, formal ethics committee review was not required. Experienced public health staff interviewed case-patients at the time of diagnosis and used a standardized questionnaire to determine symptoms, hospitalization status, and oseltamivir use. This information was entered into a statewide database. Passengers who shared a cabin with case-patients who had pandemic influenza were also interviewed about respiratory symptoms. Laboratory testing initially focused on identifying pandemic influenza cases by using the specific RT-PCR; samples determined negative for pandemic influenza virus by NAT were tested for influenza A (including seasonal influenza virus) several weeks after passengers had disembarked.\n\nApproximately 6 weeks after disembarking, all 50 passengers who had had pandemic influenza were reinterviewed about the duration and severity of their illness. These passengers included 3 interstate residents who had been treated in NSW (and excluded 28 non\u2013NSW case-patients as a convenience sample) and the 45 NSW case-patients who had seasonal influenza (excluding 55 non-NSW case-patients and 17 NSW case-patients for whom test results were not available at the time of interview). Ultimately, 62 cases of seasonal influenza were identified among NSW passengers; complete symptom data from 50 passengers who were interviewed at the time of diagnosis were recorded in the statewide database.\n\nOn-board childcare activities were provided in 3 daily sessions (9:00 am\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u201310:00 pm) in 3 areas of the ship for 3 age groups: 3\u20136, 7\u201312, and >13 years of age. Because the pandemic outbreak appeared to begin in and primarily affect children 3\u20136 years of age, the epidemiologic investigation focused on this group. Most childcare activities for this group took place in 1 room. We examined childcare attendance records for this group and, \u22486 weeks after disembarkation, interviewed the parents of all children in this group about symptoms, vaccination history, and composition of the traveling group. All specimens collected from childcare attendees were tested for pandemic and seasonal influenza subtypes.\n\nTo assess compliance with isolation and quarantine recommendations, we interviewed all 66 households in which at least 1 person with pandemic influenza was isolated, 32 NSW households with at least 1 person with seasonal influenza, and 45 randomly selected quarantined NSW passengers. (NSW passengers were selected as a convenience sample.) Interviews were conducted by experienced public health interviewers who used a standardized questionnaire.\n\nNAT detection of pandemic influenza virus was performed by using real-time RT-PCR with primers targeting the hemagglutinin gene of the pandemic influenza virus provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and following recommended protocol or by using an in-house pandemic influenza virus\u2013specific real-time RT-PCR. Seasonal influenza virus was identified by using a 2-target RT-PCR containing primers targeting pandemic and seasonal influenza virus strains (Unit\u00e9 de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique Mol\u00e9culaire des Virus Respiratoires, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) or a commercial influenza A subtyping assay (Easy-Plex Influenza profile 6; AusDiagnostics, Sydney, NSW, Australia).\n\nWe analyzed data by using Epi Info version 3.5.1 (www.cdc.gov/epiinfo). Relative risks were used to compare age (as a categorical variable split into 7 groups), sex, and place of residence. Fisher exact test results were used for cell sizes <5. A Mantel-Haenszel value of p<0.05 was considered significant. \u03c72 tests were used to compare proportions. To compare the rates of pandemic and seasonal influenza infection in childcare attendees, the number of sessions a child attended while susceptible were summed, and cases per child-sessions at risk and exact Poisson confidence intervals were calculated. Nonoverlapping confidence intervals were considered significantly different.\n\nIn total, 2 (3%) patients with pandemic influenza and 8 (8%) patients with seasonal influenza were hospitalized (p = 0.16); none died. Among the 50 passengers with the pandemic strain and 50 with the seasonal strain who were interviewed, symptoms were similar, although coryza was reported significantly more often by those with pandemic influenza (Table 2). Duration of illness was similar for passengers with either strain, but a higher proportion of seasonal influenza patients reported that illness was severe enough to limit their activities.\n\nAccording to date of symptom onset, the pandemic influenza outbreak began in the childcare center on May 18, which was 2 days after embarkation, and peaked on May 25, the final day of cruise A. The first reported seasonal influenza case was in an adult whose symptoms began on May 17; the second, seemingly unrelated, infection developed in a childcare attendee on May 21. The number of seasonal influenza cases also peaked on May 25 (Figure).\n\nOf the 48 passengers 3\u20136 years of age, 45 (94%) attended childcare. Among these 45 were 8 pairs of siblings. One child received seasonal influenza vaccine in 2008 and no child received the vaccine in 2009. The first case of pandemic influenza was in a child from Victoria, Australia, in whom symptoms developed on the third day of cruise A. The child attended childcare for 4 sessions while infectious. After the index case was identified, 19 additional cases of pandemic influenza were identified (including in 2 sets of siblings: 2 related children in whom symptoms developed at the same time and in 1 child in whom ILI developed 2 days after symptom onset in her sibling); all but 1 had attended the childcare while a known infectious case-patient was present. The first child for whom seasonal influenza was diagnosed had attended childcare the afternoon and evening before symptom onset on May 21 and for 6 sessions while symptomatic. Subsequently, an additional 3 unrelated cases of seasonal influenza were identified among childcare attendees. The 3 children who did not attend childcare remained healthy.\n\nAmong the 45 childcare attendees, NAT results for pandemic influenza were positive for 18, for seasonal influenza were positive for 2, and for both were positive for 2. ILI developed in an additional 10 children, but these children had negative influenza results by NAT; ILI developed in another 6 children who were not tested. Of these 16 children, 8 had traveling companions with positive pandemic influenza virus results and 2 had travelling companions with positive seasonal influenza virus results. The remaining 7 children remained asymptomatic. Of the 45 children who attended childcare, 44 attended concurrently with an infectious pandemic influenza case-patient and 43 attended concurrently with an infectious seasonal influenza case-patient. Considering the number of sessions attended by susceptible children, we determined that the risk for pandemic influenza infection was significantly higher (19 cases from 344 sessions = 0.055 child-sessions at risk, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.033\u20130.086) than was the risk for seasonal influenza (3 cases from 279 sessions = 0.011 child-sessions at risk, 95% CI 0.002\u20130.031).\n\nA total of 66 pandemic influenza case-patients in 53 cabins were infectious while on cruise A. Excluding the co-primary case-patients, 91 passengers shared a cabin with an infectious primary case-patient. Of these 91 passengers, symptoms developed in 50 (55%). Of these 50 case-patients, 34 were tested and 12 (35%) had positive pandemic influenza results. The secondary attack rate for those <12 years of age (16/21) was significantly higher than for those >12 years of age (34/70) (76% vs. 49%; p = 0.03). Of the 66 case-patients, 1 received oseltamivir treatment within 48 hours of symptom onset. Information about provision of oseltamivir prophylaxis was available for 34 (83%) of 41 asymptomatic contacts. Of these, 3 (75%) of 4 children <12 years of age and 17 (57%) of 30 children >12 years of age began receiving antiviral drug prophylaxis within 7 days of their first exposure to pandemic influenza virus. Of these 20, only 1 received prophylactic drug within 3 days of first exposure to the pandemic strain. Despite being asymptomatic, 11 (27%) of 41 passengers underwent laboratory testing and were negative for pandemic influenza virus by NAT.\n\nAfter disembarking, patients with pandemic and seasonal influenza were isolated in 149 discrete (family or household-like) groups. Of the 98 (66%) interviewed, 37% reported that they were first made aware of the need for isolation through media reports, 27% by their treating doctor, 26% by public health staff, 6% by the ship\u2019s staff, and 5% by fellow passengers. Of the 45 quarantined passengers interviewed, 52% were initially informed of the need for quarantine through media reports, 25% by work or school colleagues, 11% from the ship\u2019s staff, 7% from a friend or relative, and 5% from public health staff. All influenza case-patients reported that they had obeyed isolation requirements, and 43 of 45 quarantined passengers reported that they had remained in quarantine for 7 days after disembarkation. Of the 2 passengers who did not follow quarantine requirements, 1 reportedly attended work by private vehicle and cancelled all other outings; the other denied knowledge of the requirements.\n\nThree secondary pandemic influenza infections among family contacts of case-patients from cruise A were identified; a subsequent case-patient was identified as a contact of 1 person who had secondary infection. Other than these cases, no evidence of transmission to the community or to passengers of cruise B was found.\n\nWe identified dual outbreaks of pandemic and seasonal influenza among passengers on a cruise ship. Cruise ships provide ideal conditions for rapid spread of respiratory viral illnesses (e.g., many persons living closely together, frequently interacting in enclosed and partially enclosed environments, and often originating from both hemispheres). Although infections spread rapidly among passengers and to some crew members during the cruise, further spread to the community and the next cruise was avoided through intensive disease control measures.\n\nAfter identification of the outbreak, it became apparent that undetected local transmission of pandemic influenza virus was occurring in Victoria before cruise A (8) and that the virus was probably introduced to the ship by the index case-patient from Victoria. The pandemic virus spread rapidly among other childcare attendees and their close contacts and to other passengers and crew. Seasonal influenza virus was the predominant influenza virus circulating in NSW before the appearance of pandemic influenza virus (NSW Health, unpub. data).\n\nThe cocirculation of both strains in the childcare center provided a unique opportunity to compare attack rates. The pandemic strain seems to have spread among children more readily than the seasonal strain. This difference in transmissibility could have resulted from innate differences in the viruses themselves or from a level of immunity from past infection with the seasonal strain. Consistent with findings in other studies, the symptoms of pandemic and seasonal influenza were similar (9\u201312). After adjusting for underlying medical conditions, we found that hospitalization rates and activity-limiting effects were higher for case-patients with seasonal than with pandemic influenza; however, this finding may be explained in part by differences in the age-specific attack rates. The secondary attack rate for pandemic influenza among cabin contacts of 55% was higher than that reported for household contacts (13,14), despite a small proportion of these persons having received antiviral drug prophylaxis, and may reflect the close living arrangements in a ship\u2019s cabin.\n\nThe intense passenger follow-up enabled us to assess the sensitivity of the ship\u2019s medical clinic for identifying influenza cases. Before this outbreak, ships had active containment measures in place to minimize the spread of seasonal influenza, including use of point-of-care influenza testing for patients seeking treatment for ILI and oseltamivir treatment and isolation to reduce further spread. Our active case-finding efforts identified 79 influenza cases on cruise A, yet the ship\u2019s clinic identified only 6 (8%) of these. Despite enhanced community awareness of the emerging pandemic, the ship\u2019s medical clinic staff underestimated the case count by 13-fold. The number of passengers who sought treatment at the ship\u2019s medical clinic does not accurately reflect the extent of the influenza outbreak on board, possibly because the decision to seek treatment may have been influenced by a number of factors including cost, severity of symptoms, and unwillingness to be isolated while on holiday.\n\nOur investigation had several limitations. First, the case definition depended on NAT detection of virus in clinical samples, which may have resulted in misclassification of cases. Second, although the epidemiology is consistent with the first cases of pandemic influenza appearing in the childcare center, undetected or asymptomatic infected passengers or crew could have carried the viruses onto the ship. However, this scenario is unlikely because the symptoms developed in the index case-patient 2 days after embarkation. Third, although most ill passengers were interviewed within 2 days after onset of illness, interviews about severity, length of illness, and the experience in isolation and quarantine were conducted some weeks later, introducing possible recall bias. Fourth, although 2 cases of co-infection were detected, only the first 2 pandemic influenza\u2013positive specimens from childcare attendees were subtyped for other influenza A subtypes; it is possible that some of the remaining pandemic influenza case-patients were also infected with seasonal influenza. Fifth, some of the remaining pandemic influenza case-patients may have been co-infected. Sixth, the secondary attack rate for cabin contacts may be an overestimate because passengers with negative NAT results were not tested for other respiratory infections, and passengers with onset of symptoms >24 hours after symptoms developed in a cabinmate were assumed to be secondary, rather than co-primary cases.\n\nMathematical modeling suggests that containment of influenza is possible if appropriate resources are devoted. In some countries, isolation and quarantine measures have been used in response to severe acute respiratory syndrome (15\u201318), but these measures have rarely been used for influenza control. In the influenza outbreaks reported here, direct follow-up of passengers in isolation and quarantine, supported by intense media coverage, resulted in a high degree of compliance and successful outbreak containment. Additionally, providing oseltamivir prophylaxis for crew members may have contributed to the successful containment of the infection during cruise B. Although the robust application of containment measures can stop the spread of novel influenza viruses, public health resource requirements are labor-intensive and expensive and may not be sustainable except for the most virulent of pandemic viruses."}
