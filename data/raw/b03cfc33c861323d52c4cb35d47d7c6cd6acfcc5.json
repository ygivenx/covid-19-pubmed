{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Recent Progress in understanding 2019 Novel Coronavirus associated with Human Respiratory Disease: Detection, Mechanism and Treatment", "body": "quickly becomes of tremendous worldwide concern. It leads to a significant outbreak in many regions in China and expands globally, including Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa and Oceania. The disease is potentially zoonotic with estimated 2-5% mortality rate.\n\nPerson-to-person transmission may occur through contact and respiratory transmission or probable fecal-oral route. Currently, the number of ascertained infection cases has been daily increasing, but there is no definite treatment for the pneumonia although some potential drugs are under investigation. For the last two decades, the outbreaks of coronaviruses and intermittent worldwide public health emergences remind us that CoVs are still a severe global 6 health threat which can't be ignored. According to the latest research, useful information needed urgently for the control of the disease is highly essential.\n\nCoronaviruses (CoVs) are named for the crown-like (or corona in Latin) spikes of the virus protruding to the periphery with a diameter of 60-160nm under electron microscopy. sometimes involving important organs such as liver, kidney, heart and brain. Sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat. Lipid solvents such as ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peracetic acid, and chloroform can effectively inactivate the virus.\n\nCoronaviruses consist of the largest group belonging to the Nidovirales order, which 7 contains Coronaviridae, Arteriviridae, and Roniviridae families. The family Coronaviridae is composed of large, single, plus-stranded RNA viruses which are isolated from several species and previously known to induce common colds and diarrheal illnesses in humans 5 .\n\nThe Coronavirinae is one of two subfamilies in the Coronaviridae family, and the other one is the Torovirinae. The Coronavirinae is further subdivided into four groups, the alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronaviruses. The viruses were sorted into the groups according to serology initially but are now labelled by phylogenetic clustering 6 . Only alpha and beta coronavirus are of interest for human and clinical virologists 7 . Based on epidemiological data before 2019, only six CoVs proved to cause human respiratory diseases: i) HKU1, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E only lead to mild upper respiratory disease, but rarely bring about severe diseases in people; ii) SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV attack lower respiratory tract and always induce severe respiratory syndrome. Sequence analysis shows that 2019-nCoV has a typical genome structure of coronavirus and belongs to the cluster of beta coronaviruses that includes SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and it forms a clade within the subgenus Sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. It has been the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans so far 8 .\n\nEvolutionary models and phylogenetic analysis deserve attention for helping estimate genetic variability and the evolutionary rate so that in turn to provide important implications for disease progression, drug trial and vaccine development. Zhou et al. 2 report the full-length genome sequences acquired from patients at the early outbreak are almost identical to each other and shared 79.5% sequence similar to SARS-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV is 96% 8 identical at the whole genome level to a bat coronavirus. Wu et al. 1 almost simultaneously and independently discover the novel RNA virus from the family Coronaviridae. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome reveals that the coronavirus is most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses previously sampled from bats in China. Benvenuto et al. 9 \n\nMore than 80,000 cases have been confirmed as of February 21, 2020, and most of them had a history of close contact with the epidemic area in Wuhan or confirmed patients. Major initial symptoms include fever, most of which are high fevers that occur within several days and are not alleviated by routine anti-infective drugs, additionally coughing, headache and muscle pain or fatigue 15 . Other clinical symptoms observed at low frequency include elevated troponin levels, diarrhea, myalgia and myocarditis 15 . It should be emphasized that some asymptomatic patient are diagnosed as 2019-nCoV 16 , so the presence of asymptomatic carriers requires due attention. Nearly 20% of the patients appeared comorbidities with regard to the dysfunction of other organs, primarily renal impairment and patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases often demonstrated comorbid heart failure 13 . They gradually develop initial symptoms in the cardiovascular system, digestive system, and nervous system, which increased the difficulty of diagnosis 15 . The median interval from the start of initial symptoms to significant symptom aggravation like dyspnea or appearance of acute respiratory distress syndrome is 7 days, ranging from 1 day to 20 days, which was consistent with previous reports 13 . According to the newly released pneumonitis diagnosis and treatment plan for new coronavirus infection, severe patients often have dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the illness. Serious cases can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, irreformable metabolic acidosis, coagulopathy and multiple organ failure. Nearly 80% of the patients have normal or decreased white blood cell counts, and 72.3% hav lymphocytopenia 15 . Lung involvement was present in all cases 17, 18 , with most chest computed tomography (CT) scans showing lesions in multiple lung lobes, some of which are dense. Ground-glass opacity co-existed with consolidation shadows or cord-like shadows are observed. Since respiratory supports are administered to most of the patients, oxygen saturation can be maintained at above 90% as indicated by pulse oximetry monitoring 15 . It is reported that severe and critically ill patients have moderate to low fever, even without obvious fever. Mild patients show just low fever, mild fatigue, and no pneumonia. Judging from the current cases, most patients have a good prognosis but poor for the elderly and those with chronic underlying disease. Symptoms in children are relatively mild.\n\nAs for the current situation, the source of infection is mainly the infected patients, but the \n\nMild patients may not have positive signs, while severe patients may have shortness of breath with moist rales of both lungs, weakened breath sounds, dullness percussion, enhanced or weakened vocal fremitus palpation 20 .\n\nSuspected or confirmed cases should undertake chest X-ray examination as early as possible and chest CT scan is required when necessary 21 . In the early phase of the disease, chest images show interstitial changes and multiple small plaques, especially in the lung periphery. Then the changes further deteriorate to the bilateral and are mainly distributed in the middle and outer zones of the lung with multiple infiltrating shadows and/or ground-glass opacity. Patients may have a single lobe or multiple lobes involved. When the condition gets better, a little fibrous stripe may appear 22 . Conversely, lung consolidation may occur in severe cases whose pleural effusions are rarely seen.\n\nAt the early stage, white blood cell counts are normal or decreased, with decreased lymphocyte counts. If the absolute value of lymphocyte is less than 0.8\u00d710 9 /L, or the CD4 and CD8 T cell counts are significantly decreased, it needs high attention. It is generally recommended to recheck the blood routine changes after 3 days 20 . In some patients, muscle 13 enzymes, liver enzymes, and myohemoglobin levels are increased. Otherwise, the troponin is increased in some critical patients. Most patients display elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level, and normal procalcitonin levels. Severe cases show progressively decreased blood lymphocytes counts and high D-dimer levels. Inflammatory factors are often increased in severe and critical patients. \n\nLu et al. 13 in the S1 region interacting with ACE2 24 . Similar to SARS-CoV, the 2019-nCoV may also engage the RBD to bind ACE2 in order to enter the human host cells, but since many residues 16 in S1 and S2 have been replaced in 2019-nCoV, the differences in the interactions with ACE2 on host cells exist 29, 33 . Daniel et al. 34 Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug under development that inhibits viruses by inhibiting RNA-derived RNA polymerase (RdRp), which was originally used to treat Ebola but didn't work. Amazingly, it is effective against SARS and MERS. [46] [47] [48] [49] In addition to this, 2019-nCoV is unable to infect cells without ACE2 and cannot bind to 19 \n\nAt present, different institutions and organizations in China have issued several guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia, none of which pointed out specific drugs for 2019-nCoV. According to the latest treatment protocol (Pilot Version 6) issued by the Chinese health commission, antiviral therapy can be tried with interferon, lopinavir/litonavir, chloroquine phosphate and arbidol. These drugs and other potentially effective drugs are described here.\n\nRemdesivir is a nucleoside analogue with antiviral activity developed by Gilead Scientific. Its anti-RNA virus activity has been confirme, such as Ebola, Marburg virus, Nipa virus, Hendra virus [54] [55] [56] . What's more, Remdesivir has exhibited preventive and therapeutic effects on MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in vitro 57, 58 . Remdesivi is detected to have the ability to reduce MERS-CoV, improve pulmonary function and reduce lesions of pulmonary in Calu-3 cells and mouse models 48 Ribavirin is a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleoside analogue which has been used in the treatment for HCV and RSV. The antiviral mechanism is interacting with virus RdRp to inhibit RNA synthesis 55 . In vitro experiments, it's shown that Ribavirin inhibits replication of MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43, but the dosage that produces significant effects is not within the range of typical human therapies 59 . Using interferon simultaneously can reduce the dose of Ribavirin 60 . In a primate model, the clinical symptoms of MERS could be improved by the combination of Ribavirin and type I interferon 61 . However, the side effects of ribavirin, such as anemia, limit its widespread use 62 . In addition, two meta-analyses of SARS and MERS case studies exhibited limited efficacy in treating patients with coronavirus respiratory syndrome 63, 64 . Therefore, further studies are needed to determine whether ribavirin can effectively treat novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID- 19) , and Ribavirin and interferon are still in clinical trials (ChiCT R2000029387).\n\nLopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra/Aluvia) is a protease inhibitor used in combined therapy for HIV 65 . Lopinavir inhibits the decomposition of gag-pol protein, while Ritonavir inhibits the decomposition of gag-pol protein precursor and lopinavir metabolism to increase the concentration of Lopinavir 66 . It has been shown that Lopinavir/Ritonavir could inhibit replication of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in vitro. In primate models, animals treated with Lopinavir/Ritonavir for MERS have a better prognosis than those not treated 67 . A non-critical 2019-nCoV infected patient in South Korea received Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra, AbbVie) on the eighth day of admission, after which the clinical symptoms improved and the coronavirus load began to decrease until undetectable 68 . Animal models suggest that TMPRSS2 (type II transmembrane serine proteases)plays an important role in coronavirus transmission 69 . TMPRSS2 activates the S protein of highly pathogenic human coronavirus, which binds to ACE2 receptor and enters host cells 38, [69] [70] [71] [72] . Thus, TMPRSS2 inhibitors are also considered as drugs for the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia 73 .\n\nInterferon is a kind of glycoprotein and triggers the antiviral immune response in patients infected with virus 74 . In animal models, interferon inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In addition, combination therapies of interferon with other antiviral drugs have been used to treat SARS or MERS patients and show synergistic effects 60, 74 .\n\nChloroquine also has a strong antiviral effect on SARS-CoV infected cells. It interferes with virus-receptor binding by ACE2 terminal glycosylation 75, 76 . In vitro, chloroquine can enhance the effects of other antiviral drugs 34 .\n\nDue to the similar RBD structures of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, screening the anti-SARS-CoV antibodies will facilitate rapid development of monoclonal antibodies and vaccines against 2019-ncov 33 . Li et al. 33 reported that CR3022, SARS-CoV specific human 22 monoclonal antibody can effectively bind to 2019-nCoV RBD. CR3022 has the potential to be used alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infection 33 . However, the dose of needs to be screened before applying monoclonal antibodies 77 . Using convalescent plasma to treat critically ill patients has been included by the latest Chinese treatment protocol (Pilot Version 6). One meta-analysis exhibits glucocorticoids reduces the risk of ARDS 78 . But different studies suggest that glucocorticoids slow viral clearance 79 . Clinical data are still needed to demonstrate the value of glucocorticoid use for 2019-nCoV 66 . Further reliable evidence needs accumulating as a potential Chinese medicine for COVID-19. 23 \n\nFollowing its recent emergence, traveler screening is a way used to limit further spread of 2019-nCoV and the purpose is to curtail geographic spread of the infection 82 However, the traveler screening is also limited. Katelyn et al. 83 perform tests to estimate the effectiveness of traveler screening and they find within the narrow range of the tests, traveler screening outcomes are sensitive to the short incubation period mean. However, for the longer incubation periods, the larger proportions of departing travelers will not exhibit symptoms.\n\nThe point at long incubation periods they still feel healthy enough to travel and do not realize they have been exposed to 2019-nCoV which is simultaneously difficult to detect 84 .\n\nA folk method expresses that the adding of sesame oil into nostrils can prevent the spread of 2019-nCoV. In order to find the theoretical reasons to support this method for preventing viral infection of 2019-nCoV, Fan et al. 85 make discussions based on colloid and interface science pure and point out that sesame oil has a low surface tension and it is incompatible with water 86 . They investigate the epidemiological features of 2019-nCoV and find because of the low intermolecular attraction between adjacent two sesame oil molecules, the pure sesame oil has a good wettability which can readily wet the surface of various solid and aqueous phases. In view of this feature, the sesame oil might prevent the spread of 2019-nCoV. Unfortunately, the mechanism of this method remains uncertain and it is not 24 approved and verified by experimental and clinical studies. In the future, scientists need to pay more scientific attention to these potential useful clues from the folk medical methods.\n\nTraditional Chinese medicine herbs have been practiced for thousand years. In 2003, glycyrrhizin, a traditional Chinese medicine, was suggested to be promising for treating SARS 87 and it was considered to be effective and a valuable pool for the availability and the low toxicity. Searching the active compounds from Chinese herbal medicine to prevent the 2019-nCoV could be a potential strategy. Chen et al. 88 used the molecular docking to find natural compounds, they proposed the five candidates including Scutellarin, baicalin, Hesperetin, Nicotianamine and glycyrrhizin which are the potential compounds targeting the ACE2 receptor and exert anti-virus effects to prevent 2019-nCoV infection.\n\n2019-nCoV is driving China's urgent public health actions, as well as international concern. We collect the recent progress of 2019-nCoV in the hope of providing potential interventions. The spread is fast with increasing infected patients nationwide and the future development of the disease is unclear but the public should pay attention to the virus since it may be very contagious.
