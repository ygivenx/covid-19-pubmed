{"title": "Clinical features and outcomes of 197 adult discharged patients with COIVD-19 in Yichang, Hubei", "body": "Since several cases of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia was reported in Wuhan [1] .This disease was identified by the Chinase Center for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) On 2019-nCoV can also cause serve acute respiratory syndrome [3] . Numerous patients can be cured effectively at the early stage, but some patients with COVID-19 may develop pulmonary oedema, ARDS, or multiple organ failure, and even died abruptly [4] . Currently, researches about epidemilogy and clinical fearures of COVID-19 focused on the hospitalized patients [5] , but the discharged patients was still scarely investigate. Therefore, this study was aimed to clarify the epidemeiology and clinical features of discharged patients with COVID-19.\n\nThis study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Yichang Central people's hospital. All adult discharged patients with COVID-19 from Yichang Central People's Hospital and The third People's Hospital from Jan 17 to Feb 26, 2020. Those patients with epedimiology history were confirmed by chest CT scans or RT-PCR assays. Throat-swab or broncholveolr lvge fluid sample were collected from all the suspected patients at admission, and RT-PCR assays were perfomed at clinical laboratory. According to the fifih edition expert conference by Chinese healhty commission, except being indetified by RT-PCR, those suspected patients presenting with lung imaging fearure also regard as clinicially diagonsis cases in Hubei province. ARDS was identified in accordance with the Berlin definition [6] , and acute kidney injury was verified according to Improve Global Outcome definition [7] . If the serum levels of cardiac biomarkers ascended to the 99th percentile upper reference limit or new abnormalities were displayed in echocardiography or electrocardiography (ECG), the patient was regarded as acute cardiac injury. The discharged criteria included that symptom disappeared and the lesions eliminated evidently in the chest CT. Furthermore, RT-PCR was negative 2 consecutive beyond 24 hours. After discharged from hosptial, the patients went to the designated hospital for observeration. All patients except deaths were monitored up to March 4, 2020.\n\nClinical datas, including date, ages, occupation,location, presentation, underlying diseas, laboratory test, RT-PCR \uff0c chest CT, treatment and outcome were collected from electronic medical record(EMR) . If data were missing, we collect data by direct communication with attending doctor. Then the data were inputted and analyzed by SPSS 19.0 software.\n\nDescriptive statistics were presented as median with interquartile range or frequency with percentage. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is \n\nFever (153, 77.6%) was the most common presentations, following cough (89, 45.2%) and weakness (29, 14.7%), respectively. Other less common symptoms were sore throat (11, 5 .6%), shortness of breath (10, 5.1%), and muscle ache (9, 4.6%, Table 2 ). However, 3 patients without any complaints were detected by chest CT scan. Among all those patients, the average days from exposure to sympton onset was 6.14\u00b19.27 (IQR, 2-7) days. The longest incubation period was 55 days. 48 patients were accompanyed with underlaying illnes, including cardiovascular (24.4%) and cerebrovascular diseases (4.6%), endocrine system diseases (9.1%), chronic renal diseas (1.5%), maglinant tumor(1.5%), and digestive system diseases (1.0%), nervous system diseases. Considering vital sign and CT manifestations, 56 patient were admited to intensive cure unite (ICU), and 141 patients were transferred to general isolation wards.\n\nThe laboratory exmamination was underwent after admission, the blood routine results revealed that monocytes and platelet kept at normal range in numerous patients, leucocytes were at the normal range in 117 (59.4%) patients, and below the normal range in 66 (33.5%) patients. While lymphocytes decreased in many patients. Intersting, eosinophils displayed a simmilar change tendcy as lymphocytes, it decreased obviously over half of them. 44 (22.3%) patients had different degrees of liver function abnormality, with elevating of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Total bilirubin (TBIL) was above the normal range in 24(12.2%) patients, and direct bilirubin (DBIL) was above in 10 (5.1%) patient. Most of those patients had a abnormal myocardial zymogram, which indicated that Creatine kinase was above in 10 (5.1%) patients, Creative kinase MB in 19 (9.6%) patients, and Lactate dehydrogenase in 65(33.0%) patients. For the coagulation tests, Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were at the normal range in the majority of patients, while fib was above the normal range in the 78 (39.6%) patients, D-dimmer was above the normal range in the 99 (47.2%) patients. 65 (33.0%) patients had different degrees of renal function damage, with elevating blood urea nitrogen or creatin. Blood gas analysis was examined in 69 cases, and the result demonstrated that PaO 2 was decreased in the 28(40.5%) patients. Regarding the infection index, procalcitonin mainly kept at the normal range. On the contrary, c-reative protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) increased in most of patients.\n\nAlthough RT-PCR was regarded the most accurate examinations for COVID-19, the sensitivity was limited. RT-PCR postive rate was 63.5%, the first test was 46.7%, and the second test was 11.2%.Comparing with PCR , almost all patients had been discover lesions in the chest CT scans, 32 (15.3%)patients displayed unilateral pneumonia, 136 (69.0%)patients displayed bilateral pneumonia, and only 25(12.7%) patients displayed multiple monttling and ground-glass opcity(Table 4, Figure 2 ).\n\nTo avoid to hypoxemia and acute respiratory distress, 147(76.6%) patients received oxygen by nasal cathete, 34(15.3%) patients received oxygen by mask, and 16 (8.1%) patients were treated with invasive vetilation in the ICU. Common complication among the 197 discharged patients included acute liver injury, septic shock, acute myocardiall injury, acute renal injury and ARDF. Most patients were treated with antiviral drugs (Oseltamivir), 151(76.6%) patients received antibiotics(moxifloxacin and cefperazone-sulbactam), and several patients were treated with glucocorticoids (75, 38.1%) and immunoglobulin(52, 26.9%). Additionally, 81(41.1%) patients were treated with Chinese tradditional medicine. By the end of Febururay 26, 28 (14.2%) patients had died, and 169(85.2%) patient was discharged and transferred to designated hosptial for observation. The average of hospital stay was 15.08 days (IQR, 4-24, Table 4 ).\n\nCoronavirus was a large RNA virus, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may induce sever repiratory syndrome, but the remains only caused mild upper repiratoy infectious. 2019-nCoV was a new subtype, with high incidence and rapid infection, it has spreaded widely in China and abroad, involving Italy, German, Korean, Iran, and Japan [8] [9] . At present, there was no vaccine and antiviral drugs against this disease. Therefore, Extensive studies of clinical features on COVID-19 have not only a better understanding of coronavirus transimission, but have also been key to detect quickly and accurately.\n\nCOVID-19 diagnosis was based on exposures, symptoms, laboratory tests, chest CT and RT-PCR. In the early pahase of the epidemic, almost all patients worked at or lived around the Huanan Seafood Whole Market in Wuhan [10] . With COVID-19 spreaded rapidly in Hubei province, Wuhan-related exposures was regarded as a key criterion. Previous retrospective research demonstrated that 86% cases had a Wuhan-related exposures history [11] . Similarly, our study revealed most of infected patients lived around Xiling strict, because of many residents working at China Gezhouba Group Corporation, returning from Wuhan. The common symptoms of COVID-19 patients were fever, fatigue and cough, some patients may present with abdominal symptoms [12] . While a few patients without any symptoms were detected accidently by chest CT [11] . Thus, it is difficult to suspect the disease without auxiliary examinations.\n\nThe significant of laboratory examintions was blood routine, the results suggested leucocyetes were mainly normal or decreased, and lymphocytes reduced evidently in many COVID-19 patients [13] . A recent research indicated that lymphocytes,especially CD3 + lymphocytes and CD45 + lymphocytes, decreased significantly in compasrion with non-COVID patients, while there was no significantly difference in quantities and proportions of neutrophils and monocytes [14] .Results of this analysis showed lymphocytes and eostinophils decreased obviously without leukocytosis in most patients, and Neutrophils,monocytes and platelet mianly kept at normal range,it was consistent with previous reports. In term of chest CT, the typical image features were periphearl, subpleural ground glass opacities in the lower lobes. However, a study of CT mianifestions demonstrated that it was approximately 14% COVID-19 patients with atypical CT features [15] . Real time RT-PCR was considered a standard assesment for COVID-19\uff0c but the sensitivity was lower than chest CT scans, RT-PCR was 71%, chest CT scans reached 98% [16] .Thus, it was essential to perform chest CT for detecting the suspected patients.\n\nAs described before, there was currently no clinical approved antiviral drugs and vanccine All rights reserved.

Immunoglobulin may enhance the ability of anti-infection in severely ill patient, and steroids are considered in those patients with ARDS. Oxygen inhalation was important to avoid to ARDS for the COVID-19 paitents with hypoxemia. In this study, 76.6% patients receivd oxygen by nasal cathete, and 90% received antiviral therapy, and 38.1% received glucocorticoids. CDC reported that the case-fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 the overall case--fatality rate (CFR) of COVID-19 was 2.3% in confirmed cases, and CFR among critical cases may reach 49.0% [11] . Nevertheless, most of patients were still treated in the hospital. Anoter retrospective study suggest the CFR was about 11% [13] . Statistical analysis of this study found that the CFR was 14.2%, and most of them were over 70 year-old patients accompanying with chronic illness.In the past one month, numerous effective measures, including blocking cities and roads, closing supermaket, monitoring temperature, building a new hosptial and seting up medical assistance team, have been carried out to controlling infection source, preventting transmission and reducing death.Until now, there was no new confirmed patients for 13 days,and hospitalized patients decreased sharply.\n\nIn conclusion, this retrospective study, based on clinical data, revealed that COIVD-19 mainly infected in older people with comorbidities, and may cause acute severe respiratory syndrome.Chest CT was key to screen those suspected patients, and lymphocytopenia and eosnophils declining without leukocytosis may be regarded as an novel evidence in the dignosis of COVID-19.\n\nThe authors have declared that no conflict of interest exists.\n\nNo funding is provided with this study\n\nNone. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.26.20041426 doi: medRxiv preprint\n\nThe fifth edition of diagnosis and treatment was announced by Chinese healthy commission.
