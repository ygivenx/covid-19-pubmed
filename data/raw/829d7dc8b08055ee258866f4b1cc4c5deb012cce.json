[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Substitution of fluorine for hydrogen has been associated with an enhancement of biological activity and increase of chemical and metabolic stability. Important factors in fluorine substitution are the comparable size of hydrogen and fluorine atoms, the strong electron withdrawing properties of fluorine relative to hydrogen, and the increased stability of the carbonfluorine bond compared to the carbon hydrogen bond. Due to their similar van der Waals radius, replacement of hydrogen by fluorine does not greatly affect the steric properties of a fluorine-containing molecule. 9 Among fluorinated nucleosides, 2 0 -deoxy-2 0 ,2 0 -difluoro-D-nucleosides have shown antiviral and antineoplastic activities. 10, 11 Gemcitabine 12-14 (2 0 -deoxy-2 0 ,2 0 -difluorocytidine, Gemzar, Fig. 1 ) is a well-known drug widely used to treat ovarian, pancreatic, and breast cancers. [15] [16] [17] Gemcitabine phosphates interfere directly with DNA replication and can inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. 18, 19 Chu and co-workers have reported the synthesis and anti-HIV activities of some enantiomeric 2 0 -deoxy-2 0 ,2 0 -di-fluoro-b-L-erythro-pentofuranosyl nucleosides. 20 None of the compounds showed any significant activities against HIV-1, HBV, HSV-1, HSV-2, and lack of appreciable toxicity in Vero, CEM, and PBM cells up to 100 lM, except for the adenine derivative which showed a moderate activity against HIV-1 in PBM cells (3.4 \n\nRecently, we have described the synthesis of 2 0 -deoxy-2 0 ,2 0 -difluoro-D-5-iodouridine as an intermediate for a 2 0 ,2 0 -difluoro derivative of FV-100, the most potent anti-varicella zoster (VZV) virus agent reported to date. 21, 22 As a part of our program to develop biologically active nucleosides, here we describe the synthesis of two other novel 2 0deoxy-2 0 ,2 0 -difluoro-D-5-halo-uridines, containing bromine and chlorine, in order to investigate the influence of the halogen at 0968-0896/$ -see front matter Crown Copyright \u00d3 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, we report the synthesis of 2 0 -deoxy-2 0 ,2 0 -difluoro-D-5methyluridine for a comparison study. Also, since uracil-based nucleoside analogues are often poorly phosphorylated to their active phosphate species, we present the synthesis and biological study of a series of 2 0 ,2 0 -fluoro-5-halouridine phosphoramidate ProTides, 23 to bypass the nucleoside kinase-mediated first phosphorylation step.\n\n2. Results and discussion 2.1. Chemistry 2 0 -Deoxy-2 0 ,2 0 -difluoro-5-bromo-, 5-chloro-and 5-methyl-uridines 9-11 were prepared according to the procedure used to synthesise the 5-iodo derivative 8, 22 starting from commercially available lactone 1 (Scheme 1). The coupling of intermediate 3 with the silylated bases gave a mixture of the a and b anomers. The desired b anomer was obtained by precipitation from dichloroethane and the corresponding solid formed was filtered and washed with methanol to remove the trace of the a anomer. The anomeric configuration was assigned by 2D NOESY experiments. The final deprotection of 4-7 using sodium methoxide in methanol gave compounds 8-11.\n\nPhosphoramidates of the 2 0 ,2 0 -difluoro-5-halouridines were synthesised according to the previously reported synthetic routes developed by McGuigan et al. (Scheme 2). [23] [24] [25] [26] Aryl phosphorochloridates were prepared by the reaction of phenyl or 1-naphthyl dichlorophosphate with the appropriate L-alanine ester hydrochlorides and tosylate salts. The obtained phosphorochloridates 12-15 were allowed to react with 8-10 in THF and 1-methylimidazole (NMI) to give the target phosphoramidates 16-21. The free 3 0 -hydroxy group led to the formation of side-products, including 3 0 phosphoramidate, which required repeated purification and was reflected by poor yields. 31 P NMR investigations of the phosphoramidates displayed two closely spaced signals, corresponding to two diastereoisomers resulting from mixed phosphate stereochemistry.\n\nThe 5-substituted 2 0 -deoxy-2 0 ,2 0 -difluorouridine nucleosides 8-11 and the corresponding ProTides 16-21 have been evaluated for their potential inhibitory action against a wide variety of DNA and RNA viruses in cell culture. The compounds did not show appreciable antiviral activity against a broad panel of RNA viruses. However, anti-DNA virus activity, in particular, anti-herpes virus activity was observed for several compounds, in particular the nucleoside derivatives 8 to 11 (Tables 1 and 2 ). Whereas no activity was observed for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), notable inhibitory activity was recorded for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) (EC 50 : 12-33 lM), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) (EC 50 : 5.8-50 lM) and in particular feline herpes virus (FHV) (EC 50 : 1.1 and 2.4 lM for 8 and 9, and 13 and 28 lM for 10 and 11). The preferential antiviral activity against herpes (HSV-1 and VZV) viruses and the decreased antiviral activity against HSV-2 and the TK-deficient HSV and VZV strains point to the virus-encoded thymidine kinase as the activating enzyme to afford eventual antiviral activity (Table 1) . When evaluated for their inhibitory activity against [ 3 H]dThd phosphorylation by purified recombinant HSV-1, VZV and FHV TK, compounds 8 to 11 were most inhibitory to HSV-1 TK-catalysed dThd phosphorylation, followed by VZV TK and FHV TK (Table 3) . Thus, the compounds are endowed with a higher affinity for HSV-1 TK (and also VZV TK) than FHV TK. However, they were markedly more inhibitory to FHV than to HSV-1 and VZV replication in cell culture. This apparent contradiction may point to a preferential and better inhibition of the presumed antiviral target enzyme, DNA polymerase derived from FHV than the DNA polymerase derived from HSV-1 or VZV. Indeed, whereas virus-encoded TK acts as the activating (phosphorylating) enzyme, the DNA polymerase could be considered as the most likely target for the compounds after metabolic activation to their 5 0 -triphosphate derivatives. The lower affinity for FHV TK than for HSV-1 and VZV TK but higher activity for FHV in cell culture than observed for HSV-1 and VZV in cell culture, is strongly suggestive for a superior affinity of the 5 0 -triphosphate derivatives for FHV DNA polymerase than HSV-1/VZV DNA polymerase to explain the data. Alternatively, although somewhat less likely, the compounds may far better be phosphorylated in the FHV-infected feline cells than the HSV-1/VZV-infected human cells leading to a substantial accumulation of the 5 0 -triphosphate metabolite in the feline but not the human cells. Direct affinity measurements of the 5 0 -triphosphates with the herpes DNA polymerases and/or metabolic experiments with the test compounds in feline versus human cells should reveal which assumption is correct.\n\nNo antiviral activity was found for the corresponding ProTides. The observation that the phosphoramidate prodrugs of 8, 9 and 10 were devoid of marked antiviral activity is suggestive of a very limited release of the 5 0 -monophosphate and/or the parent derivative from the prodrugs in cell culture (Tables 1 and 2 ). Kinetic experiments of drug release in the intact virus-infected cells should reveal this issue.\n\nThe 2 0 ,2 0 -difluoro 5-substituted uridine nucleoside derivatives 8-11 and the corresponding ProTides 16-21 have also been evalu-ated for their cytostatic activity against a selection of tumor cell lines (L1210, FM3A, CEM and HeLa) and found to be virtually non-toxic with the exception of 8 that proved cytostatic in the middle micromolar range against several cell lines (Table 4 ).\n\nIn conclusion, several 5-substituted 2 0 -deoxy-2 0 ,2 0 -difluorouridine derivatives have been identified as specific and selective inhibitors of herpes virus replication in cell culture, in particular against feline herpes virus. They are herpes virus TK-dependent for antiviral activity. It would be of particular interest to further investigate the prototype compounds for antiviral activity in cats that suffer from an FHV infection in the eye.\n\nA series of 2 0 -deoxy-2 0 ,2 0 -difluoro-5-halouridines and their corresponding phosphoramidates were synthesized and investigated for antiviral activity and for cytotoxicity. 2 0 -Deoxy-2 0 ,2 0 -difluoro-5-iodo-and 5-bromo-uridines showed significant activity against feline herpes virus, while none of the ProTides were endowed with antiviral activity. No appreciable antiproliferative activity against any of the cancer cell lines evaluated was found. Our findings point to the 5-iodo-and 5-bromo-derivatives of 2 0 -deoxy-2 0 ,2 0 -difluorouridine as selective anti-FHV compounds that should be further explored in vivo.\n\nAnhydrous solvents were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. All reactions were carried out under an argon atmosphere. Reactions were monitored with analytical TLC on Silica Gel 60-F254 precoated aluminium plates and visualized using UV lamp (254 nm) and/or with 31 P NMR spectra. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel (35-70 lM).\n\nProton ( 1 H), carbon ( 13 C), and phosphorus ( 31 P) NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer at 25\u00b0C. Spectra were autocalibrated to the deuterated solvent peak, and all 13 C NMR, 31 P NMR were proton-decoupled. Analytical and semipreparative HPLC were conducted by Varian Prostar (LC Workstation-Varian prostar 335 LC detector) using Varian Polaris C18-A (10 lM) as an analytic column and Varian Polaris C18-A (10 lM) as a semipreparative column; elution was performed using a mobile phase consisting of water/methanol in gradient. Low and high resolution mass spectra were performed as a service by Cardiff University, using electrospray (ES). Compound purity was assured by a combination of high field multinuclear NMR (H, C, P) and HPLC. Purity by the latter was always >95% for all final products.\n\nAnhydrous TEA (2.00 mol/equiv) was added dropwise to a stirred solution of the appropriate aryl dichlorophosphate (1.00 mol/ equiv) and the appropriate amino acid ester salt (1.00 mol/equiv) in anhydrous DCM at \u00c078\u00b0C. Following the addition, the reaction mixture was stirred at \u00c078\u00b0C for 30 min, then at room temperature for 2-3.5 h. Formation of the desired compound was moni-tored by 31 P NMR. After this period the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue triturated with anhydrous diethyl ether.

After 4 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C, HIV-induced CEM giant cell formation was examined microscopically.\n\nMurine leukemia L1210, murine mammary carcinoma FM3A, human T-lymphocyte CEM and human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells were suspended at 300,000-500,000 cells/mL of culture medium, and 100 lL of a cell suspension was added to 100 lL of an appropriate dilution of the test compounds in 200 lL wells of 96-well microtiter plates. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for two (L1210, FM3A) or three (CEM, HeLa) days, the cell number was determined using a Coulter counter. The IC 50 was defined as the compound concentration required to inhibit cell proliferation by 50%.\n\nThe activity of recombinant thymidine kinase of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) TK, VZV TK and FHV TK and the 50% inhibitory concentration of the test compounds were assayed in a 50-ll reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM CHAPS, 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.5 mM ATP, 1 lM [methyl-3 H]dThd, and enzyme.

At this time point, the enzyme reaction still proceeded linearly. Aliquots of 45 ll of the reaction mixtures were spotted on Whatman DE-81 filter paper disks (Whatman, Clifton, NJ). The filters were washed three times for 5 min each in 1 mM ammonium formate, once for 1 min in water, and once for 5 min in ethanol. The radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting."}
