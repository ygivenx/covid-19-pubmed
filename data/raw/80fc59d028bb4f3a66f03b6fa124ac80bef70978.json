{"title": "Review Plasticity of T Cell Memory Responses to Viruses", "body": ". In the LCMV system, some (e.g., NP396) specific T cells, which are (CCR7 \u03e9 , CD62L \u03e9 [first and third models]) or early differentiated (CD45 \u03ea , CD27 \u03e9 , CD28 \u03e9 [second model]) pheno-probably most highly stimulated by antigen, are completely eliminated from the host. However, T cells with types appear to be more resistant to apoptosis and cycle more rapidly, and, upon antigen exposure, are other specificities (e.g., GP33) undergo various states of anergy in which there is a loss in cytolytic ability, IL-2, better at producing IL-2 and proliferating when compared to the effector (CCR7 \u03ea , CD62L \u03ea [first and third TNF\u2423, and then IFN\u2425 production, in that order ( an advantage in both antiviral and antitumor responses where antigenic variants can be quite common.\n\nDespite heterogeneity in TCR usage, many epitope-Diversity of Antigen-Specific specific responses have in the CDR3 region distinct Memory TCR Repertoires amino acid motifs that are maintained between clono-Antigen-specific TCR repertoires are highly diverse.

Thus, the TCRs on the antigen-specific T cell of high-frequency clonotypes and a large number of clones are unique to the individual, and these unique low-frequency clonotypes, which could be described by regions have been referred to as the \"private specificity\" a power law-like distribution (Naumov et al., 2003 ; Pewe for that epitope-specific response. This variation is et al., 1999). This means that a small number of clones probably a consequence of the random stochastic prowere present at high frequencies and ever-increasing cess of TCR rearrangement in the thymus, which results numbers of clones were present at lower and lower in variations in the naive peripheral TCR repertoire, and frequencies.

We The colored dots represent T cell populations that have different specificities. The intracellular IFN\u2425 staining for epitope-specific responses during particular viral infections are also depicted. A naive immune system is challenged with either of two heterologous viruses, LCMV or PV, and generates a T cell response to the immunodominant epitopes. These acute responses then decline but maintain the same hierarchy of immunodominant responses in the memory state. If an immune system that has been conditioned with one virus is exposed to the other heterologous virus, T cell populations that are crossreactive with the two viruses (red outlined) will expand preferentially, dominate the response, and go onto memory.\n\nPlasticity of Immunodominance Hierarchies. The mobilization of crossreactive memory cells into a primary an allogeneic target have shown that different regions of the same TCR can bind to two different targets (Daniel immune response can alter the immunodominance of subsequent T cell responses. In genetically identical et al., 1998; Speir et al., 1998) . This type of crossreactivity would be difficult to predict. However, a crossreac-animals with a naive immune system, the hierarchy of T cells specific to immunodominant epitopes is consis-tion involving the same determinants on the TCR would be easier to predict and identify by searching databases tent and predictable (Brehm et al., 2002). However, studies in humans have shown that there is variability in the for peptide sequences with similar amino acids accessible to the TCR; this \"molecular mimicry\" method was hierarchies of T cells responding to different HLA-A2restricted HIV epitopes in individual patients (Betts et used to identify some of the crossreactive epitopes identified above (Mason, 1998 \n\nologous immunity can therefore be complicated and duction was caused by crossreactivity or by a nonselecdifficult to predict, although they are quite reproducible tive cytokine-dependent activation, but the IFN\u2425 conin experimental models.\n\nWe suggest that heterologous immunity may underlie was a selective expansion LCMV-specific T cells with variabilities in pathology observed in some human viral some but not other epitope specificities, consistent with infections.

This argues on behalf of the active model, though it certainly seems T cell populations (Tan et al., 2002; Goldrath et al., 2002) . Not all of these cells proliferate comparably, and it is that under some conditions competition between the old and new memory cells must be a factor. thought that those undergoing the greatest degree of homeostatic division may be self reactive with host anti-\n\nThe depleted populations of virus-specific memory gens.

The intracellular IFN\u2425 staining for epitope-specific responses during particular viral infections are also depicted. The immunodominant hierarchy of antigen-specific responses is established during the peak of the CD8 T cell response to virus and remains the same during the silencing phase into memory for both LCMV and PV infection. After a heterologous virus infection, such as PV challenge of an LCMV-immune host, the LCMV-specific hierarchy is modified, the crossreactiveepitope responses (NP205) are preserved and expanded in response to PV infection, and the noncrossreactive epitope responses are reduced in number. In an LCMV-immune host, the PV-specific immunodominant hierarchy is different from that of a naive host, with the crossreactive epitope response (NP205) being immunodominant.\n\npermanently changed by subsequent infections with putatively unrelated viruses.
