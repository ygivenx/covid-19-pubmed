{"title": "Targeted Enrichment for Pathogen Detection and Characterization in Three Felid Species", "body": "Despite considerable advancements in the characterization of genetic sequence data afforded by next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, significant limitations in applying them to the veterinary diagnostic setting remain. NGS can fail to detect low-copy-number pathogens in complex biological samples due to low pathogen/host nucleic acid ratios. For example, if 10% of mammalian cells (approximately 3 \u00d7 109 bp per cell) in a blood sample are infected with a pathogen with a 10-kb genome, only 0.000033% of sequences in an NGS output file will be of pathogen origin. Additionally, pathogens isolated from clinical samples often have poor or only partially characterized genomes, can exist as genetically diverse populations within a single individual, or may be present in low abundance due to latency or stage of infection. This combination of small genome size, low relative copy number, and heterogeneous genomic content complicates pathogen detection from complex samples in the context of NGS diagnostic capabilities. For these reasons, virus isolation or culture methods for bacteria and fungi are often required prior to NGS to increase the proportion of on-target reads from clinical samples. These limitations prevent the adoption of NGS as a standard workflow in veterinary diagnostic laboratories.\n\nTargeted genome capture (TGC) is a methodology that enriches specific genetic sequences within a heterogeneous mixture of DNA or RNA (1). Whole DNA extracts (or cDNA converted from RNA) is mixed with predesigned oligonucleotide probes under conditions that maximize hybridization to genetically similar sequences in the extract. Nontarget DNA does not bind to the probes and is subsequently removed, whereas DNA bound to the probes is eluted to achieve a higher concentration of target nucleic acids than was present in the original sample. Targeted genome capture has been used to enrich nucleic acids of interest from complex biological samples. Examples include the concentration of Wolbachia DNA (an intracellular bacteria) from whole-insect DNA extracts (2) and the enrichment of Yersinia pestis DNA from Black Death victims (3). Additionally, TGC has been recently used by Wylie et al. to demonstrate potential uses in detecting multiple viral taxa from human clinical cases, which represents an important step in adapting TGC technology for diagnostics or pathogen discovery in human samples (4).\n\nHere we present the use of TGC-NGS to simultaneously detect and sequence multiple pathogens from domestic cats, bobcats, and mountain lions. We screened diverse sample types, including tissue culture fluids, blood, plasma, and swabs previously characterized for multiple pathogens using standard PCR or serological assays. Because some pathogens are common across feline species while others are species specific, we were able to evaluate the performance of these assays across several pathogen-host relationships. We designed two custom probe libraries to evaluate the ability of TGC-NGS to detect DNA and RNA from 10 viral and 1 bacterial taxa. The samples analyzed were derived from in vitro and in vivo sources covering a range of pathogen-to-host genomic ratios, from very low to very high. A bioinformatics pipeline was developed to identify host and pathogen sequences from the NGS output. Assay parameters were varied to assess the impact of probe concentration on enrichment efficiency, and unenriched libraries were analyzed by NGS to qualitatively assess the sensitivity of the NGS pipeline in detecting the presence of pathogens without enrichment.\n\nOur report provides advances in investigating several important aspects of TGC assay design, including (i) the range of fold enrichment possible for targeted nucleic acids, (ii) comparison of TGC pathogen detection with traditional methods currently used by diagnostic laboratories, (iii) documentation that a single assay design can be applied to more than one host species, (iv) the applicability of TGC to characterize pathogens in the context of veterinary medicine, and (v) the ability of TGC-NGS to characterize intrahost genetic diversity of viral pathogens (4\u20136).\n\nWe detected 31 pathogens in 28 samples representing 9 of 11 targeted taxa, including 11 pathogens that had not been previously detected by traditional methods. The enrichment of target nucleic acids achieved by TGC ranged from 58-fold to a remarkable 56 million-fold. Subsequent analysis of tissues from cats with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection documented 5 logs of enrichment that occurred at the TGC processing step. Both DNA and RNA pathogens were detected in this study, although this method was more readily applied to the detection of DNA genomes. We observed poor performance of the assay under the following conditions: (i) samples with low pathogen loads, (ii) poorly preserved samples, or (iii) when pathogens lacked significant homology to probe sequences. We conclude that this approach to detecting and characterizing diverse pathogens from biological samples is a powerful and effective methodology with practical applications in veterinary clinical microbiology. Further side-by-side evaluations with clinical samples will be necessary to fully develop this method for high-throughput diagnostic use.\n\nTen (of 16) DNA samples were known to have one or more target pathogens based on previous diagnostic assays (16 total pathogens) (Table 1, asterisks). At least one previously identified pathogen was detected in nine of these samples. All target pathogen taxa were detected except puma lentivirus clade A (PLVA), which was not sequenced in any of the three samples in which it was detected via nested PCR (estimated to represent less than 100 viral copies per one million cells, or 3.3 \u00d7 10\u22129 pathogen nucleotides/host nucleotide). Nine pathogens were detected that had not been detected prior to this study despite analysis by standard laboratory methods. The presence of all newly detected pathogens was reconfirmed by additional PCR analysis of the original samples. The breadth of coverage (percentage of each targeted genome region that was covered by sequencing reads) varied from 0 to 100%, with an average breadth of 84% among the 22 pathogens detected (Table 1). No reads could be confidently classified as belonging to novel feline pathogens.\n\nEleven of the 12 RNA samples sequenced had at least one target pathogen based on previous diagnostic assays (Table 2). Nine samples (including one negative control) were enriched according to the standard SureSelect protocol using the custom RNA probe library. One sample was enriched using half the recommended concentration of probes, and two were sequenced without enrichment (see Materials and Methods). Seven of 11 pathogens previously detected were sequenced, including four of four samples with previous detection of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and three of three samples containing feline coronavirus (FeCoV), including the sample (sample 21a) subjected to half the concentration of TGC probes as other samples. Feline foamy virus (FFV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) were partially sequenced in a sample in which these pathogens had not been previously detected. Four pathogens that had been detected by serologic methods were not detected by TGC. This included three feline calicivirus (FCV) isolates and one feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) isolate. The FCV and FHV-1 isolates were originally diagnosed via quantitative PCR (qPCR) using oronasal swab samples.\n\nOf the pathogens detected by the RNA assay, the breadth of coverage ranged from 20% to 100%, with a mean of 58.3% (Table 2). The depth of sequencing also varied greatly from a low of 30 reads/base for FFV (sample 24) to a high of 295,367 reads/base for FIV (sample 17). Neither of the pathogens in the two unenriched samples (FIV in sample 18a and FeCoV in sample 21b) were detected by NGS, although both of these pathogens were characterized in their paired, enriched RNA samples.\n\nAll 12 DNA samples in experiment 1 demonstrated a relative decrease of host GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene copies (Fig. 1A, samples 1 through 16). Depletion of host DNA averaged 74-fold in DNA libraries relative to original DNA samples (range, 3.2-fold to 1,600-fold decrease). Conversely, all 13 pathogens evaluated pre- and post-TGC by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) demonstrated relative increases in copy number, averaging 386-fold postcapture enrichment (range, 20-fold to 50,000-fold increase). The overall enrichment of pathogen DNA relative to host DNA averaged 14,000-fold (range, 970-fold to 2.8 million-fold relative increase in abundance) (Fig. 1B).\n\nThe number of NGS reads per sample ranged from 0.64 to 3.1 million (median, 0.79 million) (Table 1). Two samples (samples 8 and 9) accounted for 35% of the total NGS reads generated for the 16 pooled DNA samples. These samples contained DNA extracted from high-titer in vitro cultures of feline herpesvirus and had the lowest percentage of reads map to the cat genome (3% and 1%, respectively). For all other DNA samples, the majority of NGS reads (51% to 82%) mapped to the cat genome. Each sample contained sequences that did not map to either the cat genome or the target pathogen reference sequences representing 20 to 46% of the total reads. We postulate that most of the unmapped reads correspond to feline genomic sequences that did not map to the cat genome reference sequence, which remains incompletely annotated.\n\nGAPDH RNA was decreased in postcapture libraries relative to that in original samples in six of the nine enriched RNA samples evaluated (Fig. 1A, samples 17 through 25). The average depletion of host RNA (cDNA) was 128-fold (range, 6.3-fold increase to 63,000-fold decrease). Three enriched samples had similar or slightly increased levels of GAPDH RNA postcapture. The average difference in postcapture target pathogen cDNA relative to the original samples was 1,000-fold for enriched samples (range, 158-fold to 12,500-fold increase). The overall abundance of pathogen cDNA relative to host cDNA increased by an average of 107,000-fold in postcapture samples (range, 58-fold to 56 million-fold) (Fig. 1B).\n\nInterestingly, FeCoV in sample 21a, which was enriched using only half of the recommended concentration of baits, had values for the depletion of host cDNA and enrichment of pathogen cDNA similar to those of sample 21, which used the full concentration of baits during the hybridization (capture) step in the protocol (Fig. 1A). The two unenriched samples (18a and 21b) were the only samples evaluated by RT-PCR that did not have a relative increase in abundance of pathogen cDNA relative to the host (Fig. 1B).\n\nThe number of reads per RNA sample ranged from 2.7 million to 85.1 million (median, 24.5 million) (Table 3). Of these, the proportion of reads for each sample that mapped to the cat genome ranged from 0.7% to 65.3% (median, 41.8%). The proportion of reads that mapped to the pathogen reference sequences ranged from less than 0.1% to 96.3% (median, 1.0%). The proportion of reads that did not map to the cat genome or the target pathogen sequences accounted for 3% to 98.9% of the sample reads (median, 43.6%).\n\nThe log copy numbers of FIV and GAPDH copies remained relatively unchanged throughout the course of the preenrichment library preparation steps, with FIV copies present at a level approximately 3-log fold lower than that of GAPDH copies (mean FIV copy number = 3.54, SD = 0.60; mean GAPDH copy number = 6.77, SD = 0.46) (Fig. 2). However, the enrichment and subsequent PCR resulted in an increase of FIV copies and a decrease of GAPDH copies in each sample. The average enrichment of FIV relative to GAPDH was 147,000-fold. PLVB was originally detected at a very low copy number (100 copies per million cells) by qPCR but was not detected in any of the final enriched samples. FIV probes included in a second set of DNA probes (DNAv2) included sequences that shared 63% pairwise identity to PLV proviral genomic regions present in extracted tissues (alignment available upon request).\n\nWe have shown that TGC-NGS assays can function as broad multiplex pathogen detection assays for animal pathogens. We also demonstrated that hybridization to targeted capture probes can enrich pathogen nucleic acids up to 56 million-fold relative to host genes and that full genome sequences were retrieved from both clinical and experimental samples from three different host species. A significant number of pathogens were identified that were not readily detected using more traditional veterinary diagnostic technologies, and we documented that bioinformatics analysis alone was not sufficient to detect pathogens from unenriched samples. We identified the limitations of this technology related to very low starting pathogen concentrations and poor sample quality. Optimizing capture probes and implementing stringent quality control measures prior to NGS could enhance the utility of this technology for large-scale diagnostic use. We also recognize that while promising, NGS-based assays such as those described here require more investigation before they can be used in place of traditional diagnostic procedures, and therefore we recommend that laboratories adopting NGS-based assays do so alongside traditional methods until protocols are fully validated.\n\nImportantly, our data illustrate that probe libraries could simultaneously screen for all known pathogens of a given host species (i.e., feline and canine pan-pathogen probe libraries) or group of host species (i.e., livestock and companion animal probe libraries). The TGC-NGS approach could also be modified for specific research or clinical applications. For example, the number of probes per target pathogen could be increased if the goal is to investigate genetic diversity or rare genetic variants among a small set of pathogens. This may improve the capture efficiency and sequencing depth for each pathogen, enabling analyses into, for example, molecular evolution and intrahost diversity. Alternatively, by targeting only conserved regions of pathogens, instead of full-length genomes, more target pathogens could be included in a single capture probe library, as suggested by others (4). This could allow investigations that \u201ccast a big net\u201d when screening for pathogens within individuals or populations and allow for the discovery of unidentified pathogens of importance to the veterinary community.\n\nProbes were designed for the capture of nucleic acids from the viral and bacterial feline pathogens listed in Table 3 and in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Target pathogens were chosen because they fit one or more of the following characteristics: (i) the pathogen is highly relevant to feline health, yet current assays often fail to detect or completely characterize infection due to latency and/or high mutation rate; (ii) a relatively small genome size allowed redundancy in the capture design, providing enhanced sensitivity to diversity within the taxa; and (iii) the virus family is involved in analogous pathological processes (i.e., neoplasia or anemia) in other host species. The last attribute was included to allow potential discovery of pathogens that have not yet been associated with a particular disease syndrome.\n\nFull-length and partial genetic sequences representing the known diversity of each target pathogen were downloaded from GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/GenBank/). Nucleotide alignments were constructed using default parameters in Muscle (12). Maximum-likelihood (ML) trees were built in MEGA v.5, using the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model of nucleotide substitution (13) (trees available upon request). Rate variation among sites was estimated with a two-category gamma distribution, allowing for invariant sites. Cluster support was estimated with 100 bootstrap replicates. One or more sequences were selected arbitrarily for the probe sequence library from each polytomy and each monophyletic cluster of terminal nodes.\n\nAll sequences in the probe library were cross-referenced to the domestic cat (Felis catus) genome using the BLAST-like Alignment Tool (BLAT) (14) (the bobcat [Lynx rufus] and mountain lion [Puma concolor] genome sequences have not yet been reported). Sequences with greater than 80% homology to the cat genome (Felis_catus 6.2, GenBank assembly accession no. GCA_000181335.2) were removed from the probe library to prevent nonspecific capture of host chromosomal DNA. This step was especially important for the exclusion of probes complementary to the endogenous feline leukemia virus (FeLV) sequences that exist in the domestic cat genome.\n\nWe designed separate probe libraries for the enrichment of pathogen DNA and RNA (Table S1; see \u201cSample preparation\u201d below). Probe libraries produced by Agilent Technologies, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA), contained approximately 55,000 RNA oligonucleotides, 120 bp in length, complementary to the DNA or RNA sequences of interest. For each probe library, the sequences selected from phylogenetic analyses described above were uploaded to eArrayXD capture probe design software (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Each set of probes was designed at 4\u00d7 coverage of target sequences (individual 120-bp probes tiled every 30 bases). Although the two probe libraries were used separately for the identification of pathogen DNA or RNA, each library was designed with some probes complementary to both forms of nucleic acids for possible combined DNA/RNA enrichment.\n\nAfter the initial screen of samples with the DNA probe library, a second set of DNA probes (DNAv2) was designed to improve capture efficiency by decreasing off-target capture. The DNAv2 probe library contained all of the domestic cat pathogens included in the first version but did not target pathogens specific to bobcats and mountain lions and had less redundancy. The sequences included in each probe library design are available upon request.\n\nSamples were selected to represent the following categories of pathogen status (Table 1): (i) samples known to contain one or more target pathogens based on previous diagnostic tests, (ii) samples presumed to be negative for pathogens contained in the corresponding DNA/RNA probe library for that experiment (i.e., specific-pathogen free cats, cell cultures), (iii) samples from animals with clinical presentation or serological results suggestive of pathogen involvement but for which no infectious etiology has been identified, and (iv) samples from cats experimentally exposed to feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and puma lentivirus (PLV). All samples were acquired from existing frozen sample archives. No live animals were used or sampled for this study.\n\nDNA was extracted from blood, tissue, or cell culture samples from domestic cats, bobcats, and mountain lions using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). For each sample, 3 \u03bcg of single or pooled DNA extracts was used to construct the DNA library according to the SureSelectXT automated target enrichment for Illumina paired-end multiplexed sequencing protocol (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, each DNA extract was sheared to produce short DNA fragments (\u223c150 to 200 bp). Standard Illumina adaptors were ligated to the ends of each fragment, and adaptor-specific primers were used to randomly amplify the DNA libraries prior to enrichment (4 to 6 PCR cycles).\n\nRNA was extracted from in vivo (blood, peritoneal ascites, oral swabs) or in vitro (viral culture supernatant) samples using a viral RNA kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). For each sample, a minimum of 1 \u03bcg RNA was used to construct the RNA library according to the SureSelect RNA enrichment for Illumina paired-end multiplexed sequencing protocol (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The RNA library preparation protocol was similar to that for DNA, except that after fragmentation, double-stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) was produced from the positive-sense RNA present in the extract. The isolated ds-cDNA was then used as the template for adaptor ligation and amplification as described above. Four samples did not pass pre-NGS quality control analyses (i.e., due to low concentration or quality), and therefore only 12 of 16 original RNA samples were sequenced.\n\nDNA was extracted from mesenteric lymph nodes from four domestic cats that had been experimentally coinfected with FIV and PLV for a viral pathogenesis study (15). For each sample, a DNA library was prepared and enriched with the DNAv2 probes as described above. These samples were used for quantifying host and pathogen nucleic acids at each step of the library preparation and enrichment protocols (see \u201cEnrichment estimation\u201d below).\n\nDNA/cDNA libraries were hybridized to their respective custom capture probe libraries for 24 h at 65\u00b0C, and unbound DNA was removed by washing as recommended by the probe manufacturer (16). The enriched DNA/cDNA was then separated from the capture probes and isolated. Each DNA/cDNA library was barcoded via ligation of standard 6-mer oligonucleotides (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) for multiplex sequencing. The concentration of each library was assessed using flourometric (Qubit 2.0; Thermo Fischer Scientific, Inc., Grand Island, NY) and electrophoretic (Bioanalyzer; Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) methods, and the libraries were pooled in equal concentrations for sequencing. The DNA libraries (n = 16) and cDNA libraries (n = 12) were pooled separately, and a nonindexed positive control was added to the samples at a 1% concentration (bacteriophage PhiX-174 DNA). DNA libraries during the first experiment were sequenced as a 16-sample multiplex with 150-bp paired-end reads on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). The cDNA libraries were sequenced as a 12-sample multiplex with 100-bp paired-end reads on a HiSeq instrument (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA).\n\nWe used real-time PCR (RT-PCR) to quantify the abundance of the feline GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene in pre- and postenrichment samples according to established protocols (17). GAPDH genomic DNA or cDNA was quantified using primers from reference 18 with the following 25-\u03bcl reaction mixture: 12.5 \u03bcl SsoFast EvaGreen SuperMix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA), 1 \u03bcl GAPfwd primer (10 \u03bcM), 1 \u03bcl GAPrev primer (10 \u03bcM), 8.5 \u03bcl water, and 2 \u03bcl template (\u223c40 ng). The reaction conditions included an initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 s and 60\u00b0C for 10 s. This was followed by a melt curve in which the temperature was increased from 65\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C in 0.5\u00b0C increments using 10-s intervals.\n\nThe relative abundances of feline calicivirus (FCV), feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), FIVA, and FIVC were measured with established RT-PCR protocols (10, 19, 20). PLVA proviral DNA was measured using the following RT-PCR mixture: 12.5 \u03bcl SsoFast EvaGreen SuperMix, 1 \u03bcl 8083F (10 \u03bcM) (5\u2032-GCAGCCCTGACGGTATCC-3\u2032), 1 \u03bcl 8165R (10 \u03bcM) (5\u2032-GCAGTCTCCTCTGAACAATCC-3\u2032), 5.5 \u03bcl water, and 5 \u03bcl (100 to 500 ng) template. The reaction conditions included an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 s and 62\u00b0C for 10 s. This was followed by a melt curve with the same parameters as described above for GAPDH. PLVB proviral DNA was measured using the same PCR mixture and conditions with 1 \u03bcl each of the following primers: 643F (10 \u03bcM) (5\u2032-CTGTCTGTCATGGGGAATGAGT-3\u2032) and 773R (10 \u03bcM) (5\u2032-GTCCTGTAGCTACCAAGGCAA-3\u2032).\n\nFeline foamy virus viral (RNA) and proviral (DNA) loads were measured using the following RT-PCR protocol: 10 \u03bcl iTaq Universal Probes Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA), 1 \u03bcl FFVgag-F (10 \u03bcM) (5\u2032-GGACGATCTCAACAAGGTCAACTAAA-3\u2032), 1 \u03bcl FFVgag-R (10 \u03bcM) (5\u2032-TCCACGAGGAGGTTGCGA-3\u2032), 0.2 \u03bcl FFVgag-TM probe (10 \u03bcM) (5\u2032-AGACCCCCTAGACAACAACAGCAACACT-3\u2032), 5.8 \u03bcl water, and 2 \u03bcl template (40 to 100 ng). The reaction conditions included an initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s.\n\nFold enrichment was calculated by comparing RT-PCR threshold cycle (CT) values for preenrichment (i.e., DNA extracts or cDNA) versus postenrichment (prepped libraries) samples via the \u0394\u0394CT method. Log10-transformed fold change (\u0394CT) and fold enrichment (\u0394\u0394CT) values were graphed using GraphPad Prism v4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). The RT-PCRs and fold enrichment calculations were performed only on the subset of samples that had a sufficient sample volume remaining of pre- and postenrichment nucleic acids. Fold enrichment was similarly estimated at each step in the library preparation and enrichment protocol from FIV-containing samples enriched with DNAv2 baits.\n\nIn order to estimate the impact of enrichment on the sequencing output for targeted pathogens, 2 of the 12 cDNA libraries were sequenced without enrichment, and one was enriched using only half of the recommended concentration of capture probes. Each of these three libraries originated from the same RNA extraction as a normally enriched cDNA library that was also processed and sequenced in parallel (Tables 2 and 4).\n\nNGS reads were preprocessed by trimming known sequence contaminants from all sequences. Reads were then aligned to the Felis catus genome using BWA short-read alignment software (21). The reference sequence used for this experiment was assembly felCat5, which was obtained from the UCSC genome browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu). The genome was indexed by using the BWA-SW algorithm (22). Reads were considered successfully mapped if the read and its mate successfully aligned according to BWA. The mean and standard deviation of depth, coverage, total number of alignments, and total number of reads that did not successfully align were calculated for every chromosome of the assembly using an in-house script.\n\nAll reads that did not successfully align to the cat genome given the specified criteria were aligned to the nucleic acid sequences in the corresponding capture probe library. The successful alignment criterion was whether the read itself successfully aligned to any pathogen in the database according to BWA. The pathogen database was indexed using the BWA-backtrack algorithm. Like the alignment of reads to Felis catus, the same analytics were used to postprocess the alignments to each pathogen in the database. For alignments to both the Felis catus genome and the database of pathogens, all possible alignments according to BWA were considered, thus entailing that a read can have multiple alignments.\n\nSome reads mapped to pathogen reference sequences even in the absence of pathogens being present in that sample. This was likely the result of spurious mapping of nonpathogen reads in BWA and contamination during DNA/cDNA library preparation, similar to results recently reported by Wylie et al. (4). To differentiate true pathogen reads from false-positive reads, we calculated a \u201cpositive threshold value\u201d by using the number of reads that aligned to pathogen reference sequences in the negative-control samples. The positive threshold value was set at 100 times the proportion of total reads that mapped to each pathogen taxa in the negative-control samples. Thus, a positive threshold value was calculated for each pathogen taxa in each (DNA and RNA) experiment. A sample was considered positive for a given pathogen taxon if the proportion of reads that mapped to the pathogen reference sequences exceeded the positive threshold value for that taxon.\n\nThe alignment files associated with this study can be found under BioProject PRJNA383388 in the SRA archive."}
