{"title": "Archives of Virology Further Studies on Human Enteric Coronaviruses", "body": "Human coronaviruses have been isolated in human foetal tracheal and nasal epithelium organ culture and in rnonolayer cell cultures (1, 4, 10, 12, 16, 20) . Virions obtained from these cultures showed the typical eoronavirus morphology by negative staining (3) . Human coronaviruses have been studied extensively by negative staining of cell and organ culture fluids but until recently have not been seen or described in clinical material (6) . UltrastructurM changes following replication of coronaviruses in cell cultures have been reported by a number of workers (15) . However, there are no similar reports which describe ultrastructurM changes following replication in human organ cultures. The present electron microscopical investigation was undertaken to study the morphology by negative staining of the newly described human enteric coronaviruses (5) and to compare them with two animal enteric coronaviruses, namely, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of pigs and neonatal calf diarrhoea virus. In addition observations were made on the ultrastructural changes associated with the replication of this human enteric coronavirus in human foetal intestinal organ cultures. Infection of the organ cultures with this non-laboratory adapted virus represents a model system as close as possible to the in vivo situation and it may be postulated that t, he changes which occurred in the organ cultures may also occur in the intact host.\n\nFaecal emulsions prepared from faeces of patients with gastroenteritis were clarified using a bench centrifuge and the supernatants were centrifuged on a Sorvall RC 2-B ultracentrifuge at 50,000 \u00d7 g for 2 hours. Organ culture fluids were ultraeentrifuged in an identical manner to the faecal emulsions. Grids were prepared fl'om the ultracentrifuged deposits and negatively stained with 1.5 per cent phosphotungstic acid at pH 6.5. All grids and sections were examined in an AEI/801 electron microscope.\n\nThe porcine coronavirus (tissue culture adapted TGE) was supplied by Dr. D. Garwes (A.R.C. Compton) as a partially purified sucrose gradient preparation. The bovine eoronavirus was supplied by Dr. Janiee Bridger (A.R.C. Compton) as an ultraeentrifuged faecal emulsion deposit.\n\nHuman foetal intestinal organ cultures were prepared from the small intestine of a 24 week foetus by the method of EGGLESTONE (8) and RUBE~STEI~ and T~'RRE]:m (19) . These cultures were maintained in Leibovitz L-15 medium at ptI 6.5, supplemented with 0.4 per cent bovine albumin, 2.0 mM glutamine and antibiotics, and incubated on a rocker platform at 35\u00b0C as described by DoI~I~ et al. (7) . Cultures on the rocker platform completed a full rocker cycle once every five minutes. Cultures were inoculated with 0.05 ml of a t0 per cent faecal emulsion from patient X (5). After absorption for one hour, one ml of L-15 medium was added and explants and fluids were removed separately at. 6 hourly intervals after infection. Fluids were frozen and stored at --70 \u00b0 C.\n\nExplants were fixed with a 2.5 per cent solution of gtutaraldehyde in 0.i M cacodylate buffer and post-fixed with 1.0 per cent osmium tetroxide in buffer for one hour. After fixation they were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol concentrations and flat embedded in araldite for thin. sectioning. Sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.\n\nMarked pleomorphism occurred in the virions seen in the faecal emulsions, although the majority ranged in size, inclusive of projection, from 120 to 230 nm. The virions had radiating projections (approximately 20 nm in length) giving the characteristic appearance of coronaviruses ( Fig. I A) . All of the virions had thin radiating projections which possessed spherical or tear drop-like dilations at the distal end. Some of the particles had a T-shaped structure ~ttached to the distal end of the projection (Fig. 1 B) . These virions were not as pleomorphic as those present in the faecal emulsions and the majority ranged in size from 100 to 200 nm (inclusive of projections). The projections on the surface of the virions were identical to those on the virions seen in the faecal emulsions with the exception that no T-shaped structures were observed (Fig. 1 C) . Some virions had lost many of the surface projections ( Fig. 1 D) . There was a dramatic increase in the number of extracellular virions present in the 24 hours post-inoculation fluids compared with the 6 hours post-inoculation fluids. At 6 hours post-inoculation 27 particles were counted in five squares of a 250 mesh grid, whereas at 24 hours post-inoculation there were 243 particles in five grid squares. A t~i c a t field of the 24 hours fluid is shown in Figure 2 . Of particular interest in the virions shown in Figure 1 C, D and Figure 2 was the consistent appearance of the central electron-dense area. This has also been reported with other coronaviruses. However the virus envelopes appeared to be completely collapsed in the particles seen in the faeces (Fig. t A, 1 B) . \n\nPreliminary work had indicated the localization of the virus in the columnar epitheliut cells of the villi (5) so a t t e n t i o n was focussed on these cells.\n\nThe ultrastructure o~ the columnar epithelial cells of control cultures is shown in Figure 3A . These cells were characterized b y ~ regular microvillous border, Infected Cultures Ill the infected cultures some cells appeared normal whilst others showed marked changes. The most common changes were the complete loss of the microvillous border (Fig. 3 B) and an increase in the number of ribosomes. Other changes included a reduction in ~he height of the colnmnar epithehal cells; consequently these ceils appeared to have a markedly reduced cytoplasmic area terminal to the basal nuclei. Furthermore virus particles with an outer double membrane and having a mean diameter of 68 nm were found in the cytoplasmic vesicles and in the eisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum ( Fig. 4A and B) . Thickened membranes with an underlying densely staining material are clearly seen bulging into the cisternae (Fig. 4A arrowed) . Asymmetrical budding has not been observed. All these ultrastructural changes have been reported by 3/IcI~Tos~ (15) during the replication of eoronaviruses and were not present in any of the cells of the control cultures.\n\nOccasionally columnar epithelial cells, in the late stage of desquamation, were seen protruding from the surface of the mid-villous region. In one such cell (Fig. 5A) there was a large membrane bound vacuole, basal to the nucleus, conraining many virus particles. Close to this vacuole were bundles of filaments (Fig. 5A arrowed) , which had a diameter of 9--10 nm and similar bundles were seen throughout the cytoplasm of infected cells (Fig. 5B ) but never in non-infected cells. The tubular nature of these structures is clearly visible (Fig. 5B  inset) .\n\nCytoplasmic inclusion bodies were occasionally seen and they were composed of tubules with a mean diameter of 32 nm. The tubules consisted of an electron- Fig. 6 . Cytoplasmic inclusion body composed of tubules. Cytoplasmic microfilaments (arrowed), 18 hours post-inoculation dense core separated from further densely staining material by an electron translucent space (Fig. 6) . Possible virions were seen on the surface of the columnar epithelial cells (Fig. 5A ), but budding from the cell surface was not observed. There was no evidence of any nuclear involvement.\n\nWith the staining techniques employed in this study all the viruses examined showed the characteristic coronavirus morphology. However it was possible to distinguish between the viruses on the basis of morphology of the projections. The human viruses had thin rod shaped projections with a spherical or teardroplike dilatation at the distal end. The corona~drus-like particles described by MAT~IA~ et al. (14) appear to have a similar morphology (MATI~AN, personal communication). These thin projections were not seen on the porcine or bo~dne coronaviruses. This difference cannot be attributed to the staining procedure because identical methods were used.\n\nVariation in the surface projections has been recognized with different strains of avian infectious bronchitis virus (9, 11) . Both these groups reported projections of similar morphology to those described above for the human enteric coronavirus. Furthermore, morphological variation in TGEV projections has been described recently by R~TCUIE (18) . All of the reports clearly show variation in the morphology of the 20 nm projections of known coronaviruses and in view of this the possession of classical petal shaped projection must no longer be considered a prerequisite for coronavirus identification.\n\nIt was not possible to infect the organ cultures under one step growth curve conditions and consequently we are not able to comment on the sequential development of the virus in this model system. The general appearance of virus particles in cytoplasmic vesicles and in the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum, and the absence of budding from the cytoplasmic membrane, is in agreement with published work on the morphogenesis of coronaviruses (15) . The presence of particles in the cytoplasmic vesicles and the bulging of the membrane over underlying densely staining material are consistent with intracellular bud formation being the principle means of virus maturation.\n\nThe vacuole seen in Figure 5A was possibly produced by the coalescence of small vesicles involved with virus budding. The cell containing the vacuole was undergoing desqnamation and its disintegration would account for the large numbers of virions seen in the organ culture fluids at 24 hours post inoculation. The occasional non-membrane bound cytoplasmic inclusion bodies which were seen (Fig. 6 ) may represent viral precursors as suggested by OsHmo st al. (17) . The role of these tubular inclusions in the developmental cycle of the virus can only be ascertained by a sequential study. Figure 5A (arrowed) and 5B show densely staining tubular filaments found only in infected cells. The diameter of these filaments is larger than the diameter of cytoplasmic microfilaments commonly seen in non-infected and infected ceils (Fig. 6 arrows) , Furthermore they are much shorter in length. However, the diameter of these filaments (9--10 rim) is similar to that reported by APOSTOT,OV st al.\n\n(2) in thin sections of purified avian infectious bronchitis virions and to the recently described negatively stained nncleoeapsids of human coronavirus 229 E (13) .\n\nAll of the ultrastruetural changes described above, with the exception of the possible nucleocapsids, have been reported during the replication of eoronaviruses. This evidence of replication is substantiated by the observation of a dramatic increase in the number of extracellular particles and the earlier report (5) of fluorescence in the columnar epithelial cells of the villi. Furthermore the changes described in. this model system have also been recorded in intestinal columnar epithelial cells of animals infected with other eoronaviruses. However, unlike the animal coronaviruses the exact role of the human enteric coronavirus in human gastroenteritis remains to be elucidated. This may prove difficult in view of the prolonged excretion of this virus in the faeces (unpublished observation). Volunteer studies may elucidate this problem."}
