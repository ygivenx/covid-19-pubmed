{"title": "The MHC class-II HLA-DR receptor mediates bat influenza A-like H17N10 virus entry 1 into mammalian cells 2", "body": "to accommodate SA 2, 15, 17 . The cell receptors for the BatIVs are as yet unidentified, but they 79 are clearly not SA moieties, a conclusion reached by several studies 15, 18, 19 . Furthermore, bat 80 N10 and N11 are structurally similar to classical NAs but lack conserved amino acids for SA 81 binding and cleavage 2, 16, 17 and do not exhibit typical neuraminidase activity 18, 20 . Initial 82 efforts to isolate infectious BatIVs directly from bats have failed, mainly because the receptors 83\n\nwere unknown and susceptible cell lines were unavailable 21, 22, 23 . Attempts to circumvent 84 these limitations have included H17-or H18-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV 19, 85 DLA-DRA is a well-conserved orthologue of the human leukocyte antigen class II DR \u03b1-chain 157 (HLA-DRA) (\u223c90% amino acid identity between canine, human and Desmodus rotundus bat 158 ectodomains; Supplementary material 3). In humans, MHC-II molecules occur as three highly 159 polymorphic isotypes (HLA-DR, HLA-DP and HLA-DQ) which are selectively expressed 160 under normal conditions on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs), including B, 161 dendritic and mononuclear phagocyte cells. These molecules are non-covalently associated 162 heterodimers of two glycosylated, transmembrane polypeptide chains, the monomorphic 163 35-kDa \u03b1-chain and the highly polymorphic 28-kDa \u03b2-chain 36 . Both chains have an 164 extracellular portion composed of two domains (\u03b11 and \u03b12, or \u03b21 and \u03b22) that is anchored 165 on the cell membrane by short transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 2c ). In the 166 classical scenario, the protease-derived foreign antigen peptides bind to MHC class II proteins 167 in the cleft formed by the \u03b11 and \u03b21 domains, and the complex is transported to the cell 168 surface 36, 37 . When antigenic peptides are not available, endogenous peptides such as the class 169 II associated invariant peptide (CLIP) substitute them and restore MHC class II dimer 170 stability 37 . The complex of HLA-DR and endocytosed peptides (usually 9-30 amino acids in 171 length), constitutes a ligand for the T-cell receptor (TCR) and plays a key role in the 172 presentation of foreign antigens to CD4 + T helper cells and immune surveillance 38, 39 . 173\n\nSince the ultimate goal of our studies is to obtain insight on the zoonotic potential of H17N10, 175 we focused on the possible influence of HLA-DR on cellular susceptibility to H17. Hence, 176 taking advantage of the high expression of HLA-DR on certain human hematopoietic 177 carcinomas 40 , we further explored H17-PV tropism using a panel of human leukaemia and 178 lymphoma cell lines (Fig. 2d) . We found that the Burkitt's lymphoma-derived Raji, Ramos and 179 BJAB B-lymphocytes and the B lymphoblastoid cells (B-LCL) show decreasing susceptibility, 180 in that order, to H17-PV. Kasumi-1 leukaemic cells showed marginal susceptibility in terms of 181 luciferase activity, while Molt-4 and HL-60 leukaemic cells, Jurkat T-cells, pro-monocytic THP-182 1 and U-937 cells, and primary B cells showed no susceptibility to the pseudotypes (Fig. 2d,  183 left Y axis). We hypothesised that the different susceptibility of the various cell types by H17-184 PV were due to disparate expression of HLA-DR, confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis for a non-185 polymorphic region of the \u03b1 chain of HLA-DR on the same samples (Fig. 2d , right Y-axis). The 186\n\npresence of the HLA-DR heterodimer was also confirmed by flow cytometry with a FITC-187 conjugated monoclonal antibody (clone T\u00fc36), which specifically binds to a monomorphic 188 epitope on the HLA-DR \u03b1/\u03b2 complex and not the isolated \u03b1 or \u03b2 chains (Fig. 2e) cells correspondingly reduced the infection of H17-PV by 50% (Fig. 2f) . 203\n\nTo determine if blocking attachment of virus to the HLA-DR ectodomain can prevent its entry, 205\n\nRaji cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of a monoclonal antibody (mAb 206 Clone 302CT2.3.2) targeting a monomorphic, extracellular region of the HLA-DRA antigen 207 author/funder.

The presence of the antibody significantly reduced, in 208 a dose-dependent manner, infection with H17-PV but not VSV-G-PV (Fig. 2g) . 209\n\nWe next sought to ascertain whether ectopic expression of HLA-DR was sufficient to increase 211 the susceptibility of non-APC, HEK293T/17, cells to the H17-PVs. HEK293T/17 cells were 212 transiently transfected with the DRA expression vector, alone or in combination with DRB1. Taken together, HLA-DR is shown to function as a bona fide entry mediator for H17 but may 226 function with unknown factors that facilitate virus internalisation. Interaction between HLA-227 DR and H17 may trigger viral entry through canonical receptor-mediated endocytosis, but 228 could also trigger entry through an activation of cell signalling pathways that the virus 229 subverts to its advantage. Our finding therefore raises questions on the utility and possible 230 evolutionary advantage(s) that an APC-associated receptor would confer to H17N10 231 infectivity and broader fitness. Some viruses exploit cells of the immune system, such as 232 macrophages, B and dendritic cells, either as viral reservoirs or as \"Trojan horses\" to 233 author/funder. All rights reserved.

The measles virus for example, exploits macrophages or 234 dendritic cells, which traffic the virus to bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue or regional 235 lymph nodes, resulting in local amplification and subsequent systemic dissemination by 236 viremia 46 . A similar strategy employed by H17N10 could provide an explanation on why viral 237 RNA was detected in different organs and tissues in carrier S. lilium bats (i.e. lung, kidney, 238 liver, intestine) and why the virus fails to grow in vitro in cell lines developed from the same 239 In this study we did not establish the stoichiometry of the HLA-DR: H17 engagement, or 250 clarify how the virus moves to sub-membranous regions and might hijack the receptor-251 mediated signalling pathway to promote its internalization. It is likely that the determinants 252 of viral entry in vivo are more complicated. We cannot rule out the use by H17N10 (as by 253 other bat-borne viruses, e.g. SARS CoV 51, 52 ) of more than one molecular species as (co-) 254 receptors. Nevertheless, the implication of this study is that H17N10 has the capacity to 255 enter human HLA-DR + cells and our work provides substantial evidence that the H17N10 256 virus has zoonotic potential. The current finding not only sheds light on the understanding 257 of BatIV host range, but also provides additional information on the evolution of influenza 258 A viruses. 259 author/funder.
