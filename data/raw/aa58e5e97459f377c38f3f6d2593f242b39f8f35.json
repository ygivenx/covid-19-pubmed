{"title": "Transmission and evolution of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in Saudi Arabia: a descriptive genomic study", "body": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a newly described disease in human beings, fi rst reported from Saudi Arabia in September, 2012, after identifi cation of a novel betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV) from a Saudi Arabian patient who died from a severe respiratory illness. 1 As of Sept 12, 2013 , there have been 114 laboratory-confi rmed cases of MERS-CoV infections with 54 deaths reported to WHO. 2 All cases have been directly or indirectly linked to one of four countries in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates), with most cases (90 cases and 44 deaths) reported from Saudi Arabia, occurring as sporadic, family, or hospital clusters. 2 Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV has been documented in England, France, Tunisia, Italy, and Saudi Arabia.\n\nCoronaviruses are a family of viruses infecting birds and mammals. The animal source and mode of transmission of MERS-CoV to human beings is not known. This information is essential for developing inter ventions for reducing the risk of transmission and developing eff ective control measures. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic between Nov, 2002, and July, 2003, molecular analysis of SARS-CoV from patients from various geographical regions was essential for understanding viral evolution and the spread of the disease. 3 Phylogenetic analysis suggested that SARS-CoV probably originated in bats and spread to people. A genetic link between the SARS-CoV in people and in civets revealed cross-host evolution. 4 There is currently little information about the molecular evolution of MERS-CoV and how this relates to virus transmission. The cellular receptor for MERS-CoV has been identifi ed as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26) 5 and the structure of the receptor binding domain of the virus spike protein complexed with DPP4 has been established. 6 The tissue distribution of this receptor within mammals is consistent with the lung and kidney pathology of the virus. 5 The conservation of the receptor across mammals suggests many possible non-human hosts; however, so far no animal reservoir has been identifi ed for MERS-CoV. The closest relative to MERS-CoV was identifi ed through phylogenetic analysis of a short fragment sequenced from the bat species Neoromicia zuluensis. 7 However, in view of the estimated evolutionary rate of MERS-CoV, the most recent common ancestor between this isolate and MERS-CoV existed in bats more than 44 years ago. 8 A recent serological study of dromedary camels in Oman and the Canary Islands found cross-reactive antibodies to MERS-CoV, but the investigators were unable to amplify any MERS-CoV-like viral sequences from the samples. 9 A small fragment of sequence identical to the EMC/2012 MERS-CoV has been reported from a Taphozous perforatus bat captured in Saudi Arabia, suggesting a regionally relevant bat reservoir. 10 Genomic sequencing of MERS-CoV is important, and molecular epidemiology can reveal spatiotemporal patterns that help identify whether all MERS-CoV infections originated from a single zoonotic event, with subsequent human-to-human transmission, or from many zoonotic events at several geographic locations. This information is crucial for an accurate assessment of the epidemic potential of MERS-CoV. 11 In addition to confi rming diagnosis, generating sequence data directly from epidemiologically defi ned cases provides the essential basis for defi ning the spread, evolution, and origin of \n\nHere we report MERS-CoV genomes obtained directly from 21 patients with MERS from across Saudi Arabia and assess the spatiotemporal distribution of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia.\n\nClinical samples were screened with RT-PCR, as described elsewhere, 12, 13 with amplifi cation targeting both the upE and ORF1A for confi rmation. Deep sequencing was done on nucleic acid extracted from real-time PCR confi rmed cases of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. Typically 50 \u03bcL of nucleic acid was generated from 200 \u03bcL of tracheal aspirate or from a nasopharyngeal or throat swab with automated processing. PCR amplifi ed DNA amplicons covering the entire MERS-CoV genome were prepared as described elsewhere. 14 The PCR amplicons for each sample were pooled for Illumina library (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) preparation with each sample processed to include a unique barcode sequence. Standard MiSeq 150 base pair paired-end reads were generated. Sequence data were de-multiplexed into sample-specifi c readsets, processed to remove primer sequences at the ends of reads, and trimmed from their 3\u02b9 end until the median phred-scaled quality score was >35\u00b70, discarding reads smaller than 125 nucleotides. The processed readsets were assembled into large contiguous sequences (contigs) using the de-novo assembler SPAdes. 15 The readset was also mapped against the Al-Hasa_1_2013 genome (GenBank accession number KF186567 16 ) using SMALT (version 0.5.0) to generate a reference-based consensus. In cases where the de-novo assembly was split over several contigs, they were aligned against the reference-based consensus before merging. Any diff erences between de-novo and reference-based methods were resolved by direct examination of the original read set.\n\nThe 13 was calculated and compared with the expected number of mutations in view of the time elapsed between the sampling dates of each pair. Because the number of mutations between two sequences accords with Poisson distribution, rejection of the epidemiological linkage between the two is considered if the observed number of mutations falls outside of the 95% upper confi dence level in the cumulative density function. To account for the many independent comparisons, a Bonferroni correction was applied, adjusting the signifi cance level to 3\u00b785 \u00d7 10 -\u00b3. Temporal dynamics of MERS-CoV were assessed with time-resolved phylogenies using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method in BEAST version 1.7.5. 20 Because of the close epidemiological relation between the nine Al-Hasa isolates, the cluster was collapsed to the earliest isolate (Al-Hasa_2_2013) resulting in a fi nal set of 11 MERS-CoV isolates before generating molecular clock phylogenies. A second alignment of only-coding regions (ORF1ab, S, ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5, E, M, and N), was used for selecting codon-position substitution models.\n\nThe most appropriate evolutionary model was established by comparing the marginal likelihood of diff erent models, estimated using the path-sampling approach implemented in BEAST. The HKY+\u0393 4 substitution model was selected as most appropriate, with separate rates for the three codon positions, under an uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock 21 and a fl exible Gaussian Markov random fi eld Bayesian skyride coalescent. 22 The geographical locations of ancestral nodes in the time-resolved phylogeny were inferred with a discrete phylogeographical diff usion model; Bayesian stochastic search variable selection identifi ed the statistically signifi cant transition rates between locations. Both symmetrical and asymmetrical substitution models were tested in combination with either a geographicaldistance-informed model, in which the transition rate of a virus between locations is inversely proportional to the distance between them, or a strict model, with equal rates between all locations. Marginal likelihood values for each model were estimated using path-sampling, and \n\nO_Al-Hasa_8_2013 Al-Hasa_21_2013\n\nK_Al-Hasa_4_2013 I_Al-Hasa_3_2013\n\nF_Al-Hasa_9_2013\n\nY_Al-Hasa_15_2013\n\nX_Al-Hasa_12_2013\n\nemployed in the Bayes factor comparison to establish the better supported model. There was no diff erence between the four models (Bayes factors <3), so in view of the limited number of sequences and locations, the symmetrical substitution model under equal rates was chosen to reduce the risk of over-paramaterisation.\n\nPositively-selected sites in the MERS-CoV genomes were detected with the mixed eff ects model of evolution implemented in HyPhy 23 to calculate the ratio of synonymous to non-synonymous substitutions (\u03c9) for each codon, allowing this ratio to vary between the branches of the alignment's phylogenetic tree to detect occurrences of episodic selection, where the site under selection only occurs on a subset of samples on a specifi c lineage in the phylogeny.\n\nThe sponsor of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had fi nal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\nSequencing of the MERS-CoV needs conversion of the 30 000 nucleotide RNA genome to DNA using reverse transcription and subsequent PCR amplifi cation. Figure 1 shows a typical set of successful reverse transcription PCR amplicons. The amplicons for each sample were pooled for Illumina sequencing as described in the methods section. Coverage of the resulting short-reads across the MERS-CoV genome was assessed by mapping a random 100 000 read subset to the Al-Hasa_1_2013 genome (fi gure 1), where the average coverage for all samples was shown to be greater than 3 \u00d7 10\u00b3. After denovo assembly, genomes were validated by ensuring that the expected open reading frames (ORFs) were intact (fi gure 1). This method was used to generate complete or partial genomes from 21 MERS cases with sample collection dates from June, 2012, to June, 2013 (table 1) origins of clade A, we focused our analysis on sequences obtained directly from patient material, namely those in clade B. Importantly, genome Bisha_1_2012 (fi gure 2, in light green) was obtained with direct sequencing of nasopharyngeal swab material from the same patient reported as the source of the EMC/2012 virus (fi gure 2, in light green). 26 A time-resolved phylogeny was generated from all epidemiologically unlinked viruses with genome coverage greater than 70% (fi gure 3). The tightly-linked Al-Hasa cluster was collapsed to a representative isolate (Al-Hasa_2_2013) along with the Al-Hasa_8_2013 isolate that was determined to be epidemiologically unrelated (fi gure 4, table 2). Geographical locations of the ancestral viruses were co-estimated along with the phylogeny, to assess the spatial evolution of the virus. These results suggest the circulating virus in Saudi Arabia is centred around Riyadh, with sporadic excursions to other centres; the most probable geographical location for all of the internal nodes, except for the Al-Hasa outbreak, is in Riyadh (fi gure 3). However, with the exception of the ancestor to the Al-Hasa outbreak, the posterior probability on these ancestral geographical locations is low, highlighting the degree of uncertainty on these inferred locations. The number of isolates for each location is small, with only Riyadh and Al-Hasa having more than one isolate. Because the two Al-Hasa isolates cluster together, the positioning of Riyadh along the internal branches could be due to it being the only location present at many distinct positions in the topology.

Assuming that the number of diff erences between two sequences over a length of time is Poisson distributed, with \u03bb equal to the expected number of mutations, the probability of getting the observed number of mutations between the two sequences by chance can be calculated from the cumulative density function of the Poisson distribution. A transmission pair was rejected if the cumulative probability value was less than 0\u00b705. A Bonferroni correction was applied to account for multiple comparisons, resulting in an adjusted signifi cance level of 3\u00b785 \u00d7 10 -\u00b3. ASR=ancestral sequence reconstruction as defi ned in However, although the posterior probability on the root node being Riyadh is low (0\u00b748), it is still more than double that of any other location, suggesting that the low probabilities are due to the small number of genomes (the legend of fi gure 3 lists the posterior probabilities). Additional genomes will be needed to improve confi dence in these inferences. Estimation of the evolutionary rate for this expanded number sequences shows MERS-CoV evolving at 6\u00b73 \u00d7 10 -\u2074 substitutions/site per year (95% highest posterior density [HPD] 1\u00b74 \u00d7 10 -\u2074 to 1\u00b71 \u00d7 10 -\u00b3) establishing the time to most recent common ancestor for clade B (excluding EMC/2102 and Jordan-N3) as July, 2011 (95% HPD July, 2007, to June, 2012).\n\nSingle nucleotide diff erences between all MERS-CoV genomes were assessed (fi gure 5). In this analysis, all available MERS-CoV genomes were aligned and the nucleotide at each position was compared with the nucleotide at the same position in the earliest genome, Bisha_1_2102. Many nucleotide changes were in the last third of the genome; if these changes result in aminoacid changes they might alter important accessory proteins as well as the receptor-binding spike protein encoded at nucleotide positions 21 000-25 500. Selection analysis of the 11 epidemiologically unlinked MERS-CoV genomes was done to detect evidence of natural selection in the MERS-CoV genome. Using the mixed eff ects model of evolution method, codon 1020 in the spike gene was identifi ed as being under episodic selection (p=0\u00b7021) along the branch between the main Saudi Arabian lineage and the Munich/AbuDhabi/2013 cluster. The isolates in the Munich/AbuDhabi/2013 cluster have a histidine at this position, whereas those in the Saudi Arabian lineage have an arginine (fi gure 2). The presence of an arginine at this position in the Saudi Arabian lineage suggests a potential cleavage site for the endosomal protease furin 27 or for trypsin-like proteases. 28, 29 Because of the possible role of spike protein cleavage in potentiating membrane fusion and coronavirus entry, 30 and previous observations on SARS coronavirus spike evolution, 31,32 the phenotypic eff ect of this change should be established.\n\nEvidence was sought for multiple, distinct zoonotic introductions into human beings of MERS-CoV compared with a single introduction of clade B with 15 of the new virus genomes from the Al-Hasa region form a polytomy with the previously described Al-Hasa_1_2013 through Al-Hasa_4_2013 cluster 16 (marked Al-Hasa in fi gure 2). These genomes were used to assess MERS-CoV transmission patterns in detail. In view of the rate of evolution for MERS-CoV, we tested the likelihood of the transmission network for the Al-Hasa cluster. 16 Although patient A was suggested to be the index case in Al-Hasa, transmitting to patient C and then onward, neither patient A nor C were molecularly confi rmed MERS-CoV cases. The similarity of viruses from patients B, F, G, H, and I suggests that a closely related virus could be the important early virus in the outbreak.\n\nWe reconstructed the hypothetical ancestral sequence (ASR) of the Al-Hasa cluster as a surrogate for this original virus. Pairwise statistical assessment of epidemiologically defi ned transmission events, in view of the observed genetic divergence of the virus genomes and the time intervals, supports eight of 13 proposed transmissions in the Al-Hasa outbreak 16 (table 2) ; however, transmissions between the Al-Hasa patients G:M, G:X, X:Y, J:Q, and Q:T are not statistically supported (table 2, fi gure 4), suggesting independent sources of infections within the Al-Hasa outbreak (fi gure 4).\n\nThe geographical distribution and phylogenetic relation of MERS-CoV across time in Saudi Arabia was investigated. The close phylogenetic clustering of the MERS-CoV isolates from the Al-Hasa region is consistent with spread via human-to-human transmission. In addition to the Al-Hasa cluster, many well supported phylogenetic clades and singletons (hereafter referred to as genotypes) exist, possibly each from a separate zoonotic event (fi gure 2). These distinct genotypes, which include the Munich/AbuDhabi, England-Qatar, Riyadh_3 cluster; the Bisha-1, Riyadh_1 cluster; and the singletons Hafr-Al-Batin_1, Riyadh_2, Buraidah_1, England2-HPA, each have strong statistical support, with Bayesian posterior probabilities of 0\u00b787 or greater-often reaching 1\u00b70.\n\nOur study presents the genetic analyses of the largest number of MERS-CoV genomes described so far (panel). The most important fi ndings from this study are that at least two distinct lineages were circulating in Riyadh in October, 2012, and transmission patterns in the epidemic are consistent with both human-to-human transmission and sporadic zoonotic events. An updated evolutionary rate supports the circulation of MERS-CoV since the middle of 2011.\n\nThe 21 MERS-CoV full genome sequences provide greater detail in tracking MERS-CoV transmission. We also recreated the virus transmission pathways, with particular reference to the Al-Hasa cluster, 16 to establish whether all MERS-CoV infections in people result from a single zoonotic transfer with subsequent human-tohuman transmission or if they are from many zoonotic events. Our data suggest that local spread of virus in the Al-Hasa outbreak might be more complex than previously thought, with additional sources of the virus contributing to hitherto human-to-human transmission chains. This is consistent with the multiple tree clusters described by Breban and colleagues 11 and support their optimistic R 0 scenario for MERS-CoV.\n\nMERS-CoV from the Al-Hasa region is consistent with spread via human-to-human transmission, with the initial case derived from a zoonotic event. In addition to the Al-Hasa cluster (fi gure 2), multiple distinct MERS-CoV genotypes exist, possibly each from a separate zoonotic event. These include the Munich/AbuDhabi, England-Qatar, Riyadh_3 cluster, the Bisha-1, Riyadh_1 cluster, and the singletons Hafr-Al-Batin_1, Riyadh_2, Buraidah_1, and England2-HPA (Makkah). The Riyadh region shows three distinct MERS-CoV genotypes. In view of the evolutionary rate of the virus it is not expected\n\nWe searched PubMed, ProMed, and Genbank on Aug 15, 2013, for all relevant English language publications with the terms \"Middle East respiratory syndrome\", \"MERS-CoV\", and \"HCoV-EMC\" individually and in combination with the terms \"sequence\", \"genome\", and \"phylogeny\". Articles relevant to our report are cited in the text. The phylogenetic relation of our 21 Saudi Arabian MERS-CoV sequences was assessed in combination with the nine published MERS-CoV genomes. The geographical distribution and phylogenetic relation of MERS-CoV across time in Saudi Arabia was reviewed. Geographical locations of the ancestral viruses were co-estimated along with the phylogeny, to assess the spatial evolution of the virus.\n\nMERS-CoV full genome sequences provide greater detail in tracking transmission. There is little information about the molecular evolution of MERS-CoV and how this relates to virus transmission. MERS-CoV genomes obtained directly from 21 MERS patients from across Saudi Arabia show three distinct MERS-CoV genotypes in Riyadh. Phylogeographic analyses suggest the MERS-CoV zoonotic reservoir is geographically disperse. Selection analysis of the MERS-CoV genomes reveals the expected accumulation of genetic diversity including changes in the S protein. Multiple introductions of MERS-CoV were identifi ed and suggest lower R 0 values. MERS-CoV is evolving within the largely human-to-human Al-Hasa cluster but the phenotypic consequences of these variants needs assessment before adaption can be inferred. Transmission within Saudi Arabia seems consistent with either movement of an animal reservoir, animal products, or movement of infected people. Our results provide important and substantial genomic information on MERS-CoV and a direction for further investigation. That there were three genetically distinct lineages of MERS-CoV in Riyadh suggests it is unlikely that the Riyadh infections are the result of one, continuous human-to-human transmission chain. Further defi nition of the exposures responsible for the sporadic introductions of MERS-CoV into human populations is urgently needed to provide the necessary information to interrupt transmission and contain the virus. that a single zoonotic event was the source of the epidemic. Such high local diversity could arise from zoonotic events in Riyadh if the MERS-CoV diversity in the animal reservoir is being continuously imported from other regions. Alternately, Riyadh is the largest population centre in Saudi Arabia and therefore the largest target for human-to-human transmission. The many circulating genotypes might be a consequence of the movement of infected people from other regions, this is supported by Riyadh_1_2012 clustering with Bisha_1_2012 and Riyadh_3-2013 clustering with viruses from Doha (England_Qatar_2012) and Abu Dhabi (Munich/AbuDhabi), the two largest urban centres in neighbouring countries (fi gure 6).\n\nMERS-CoV is evolving within the largely human-tohuman Al-Hasa cluster but the phenotypic consequences of these variants need assessment before adaption can be inferred. All recent MERS-CoV encoded S proteins diff er from the well studied EMC/2012 S protein at codon 1020; therefore, the consequences of this change should be carefully monitored.\n\nCalculations with this larger set of MERS-CoV sequences provide an estimate of the emergence of MERS-CoV in July, 2011, with a broad credible interval (95% HPD July, 2007, to June, 2012). Analyses using short sequences suggest that the MERS-CoV virus might have an ancestor in bats. 7, 10, 14, 26 Using the evolutionary rate from our study we show a substantial period since these viruses shared a common ancestor, suggesting that there might be an intermediary host as the source of human infections. MERS-CoV has not yet been identifi ed in any animal sources. Therefore fi eld studies of all probable reservoir species, including camels, bats, goats, sheep, dogs, cats, rodents, and others in Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries are ongoing. A history of contact of Saudi Arabian MERS-CoV patients with camels and goats has been reported in some cases. Serological testing for MERS-CoV has detected antibodies to the virus in camels in Oman and the Canary Islands 9 suggesting that a virus that stimulates antibody responses cross-reactive with MERS-CoV has been recently circu lating among camels; however, the only way to establish if the virus eliciting the antibody response is the same as human MERS-CoV is to isolate the MERS-CoV itself in a camel. Further, the recent reports of mild and asympto matic cases discovered through monitoring and testing of contacts of confi rmed cases suggest that the focus on severe disease as a surveillance strategy might be missing substantial numbers of milder or asymptomatic cases.\n\nOur results provide important and substantial genomic information on MERS-CoV and a direction for further investigation. That there were three genetically distinct lineages of MERS-CoV in Riyadh suggests it is unlikely that the Riyadh infections are the result of one, continuous human-to-human transmission chain. Further defi nition of the exposures responsible for the sporadic introductions of MERS-CoV into human populations is urgently needed to provide the necessary information to interrupt transmission and contain the virus.\n\nAIZ, ZAM, and AAA-R conceived the project as part of the Global Centre for Mass Gatherings Medicine R&D initiative on MERS-CoV.
