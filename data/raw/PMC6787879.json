{"title": "Feline coronavirus-associated myocarditis in a domestic longhair\ncat", "body": "A 9-month-old entire male domestic longhair indoor cat presented to the referring\nveterinarian (Ambulatorio Veterinario Brollo, Italy) with 1-week history of small\nintestinal diarrhoea. The cat was recently dewormed with milbemycin\noxime/praziquantel (Milbemax tablets for small cats and kittens; Elanco); it was not\nvaccinated and had no travel history outside the country. On physical examination,\nall vital parameters were within normal limits, except for raised rectal temperature\n(39.6\u00baC). On abdominal palpation, there was a suspicion of thickened intestines.\nUpon serology, the patient was negative for feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) p27\nantigen and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibodies (IDEXX Laboratories).\nFaecal flotation did not detect any ova, parasites or cysts. ELISA antigens for\nGiardia species and parvovirus (IDEXX Laboratories) were not\nretrieved from the faeces. Infectious causes of diarrhoea, such as viruses\n(coronavirus, parvovirus, rotavirus, etc), bacteria (primary or secondary\ninfections) or, less likely, parasites, were considered most likely, while other\ncauses (ie, dietary intolerance, pancreatitis, intussusception, etc), although less\nlikely, were not completely ruled out. There was neither a history of toxin exposure\nnor dietary indiscretion. The patient was started on antibiotic treatment:\nmetronidazole/spiramycin (Stomorgyl two tablets [Merial]; metronidazole 12.5 mg/kg\nand spiramycin 75,000 UI/kg q24h PO for 14 days), along with supportive treatment of\nthe diarrhoea with prebiotics, probiotics (Florentero tablets [Candioli]; Carobin\nPet paste [NBF Lanes]; both given as needed) and a highly digestible diet (i/d\nHill\u2019s Prescription Diet).\n\nTwo days later, the patient re-presented to the referring veterinarian with\npersistent diarrhoea and weight loss (100 g). On physical examination, all vital\nparameters were within normal limits, except for rectal temperature, which was still\nslightly raised (39.7\u00ba C). The cat was normally hydrated. Haematology and\nbiochemistry revealed moderate non-regenerative anaemia (20.3%; reference interval\n[RI] 24\u201345%) and hyperglobulinaemia (5.4 g/dl; RI 2.8\u20135.1) with an albumin/globulin\nratio of 0.44. The anaemia was likely due to chronic disease or gastrointestinal\nblood loss, whereas the hyperglobulinaemia and low A/G ratio were most likely\nexplained by an inflammatory or infectious process. Given that the patient was\ncardiovascularly stable, the treatment course was extended further.\n\nAs the diarrhoea was still present 18 days after the first presentation, the patient\nwas referred to another veterinarian (MAE), in order to further investigate the\nnature of the clinical signs. An abdominal ultrasound demonstrated severe jejunal\nwall thickening (up to 9 mm) with loss of layering, while no other abnormalities\nwere observed. An exploratory laparotomy was performed under general anaesthesia, in\norder to collect full-thickeness biopsies. This revealed markedly thickened jejunal\nloops and ileocolic junction (the latter showed partial lumen occlusion) and mild\nileocaecal lymphadenomegaly. An enterectomy and a termino-terminal surgical\nanastomosis between the proximal ileum and the descending colon were performed.\nFurthermore, one of the ileocaecocolic lymph nodes was excised. Two days after\nsurgery, the patient was discharged, awaiting the results. Histopathology of the\njejunal biopsies revealed several aggregates of macrophages and neutrophils,\ntogether with smaller numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells transmurally\ninfiltrating the intestinal wall with a multifocal vasculocentric pattern.\nHistopathology of the ileocaecocolic lymph node showed reactive hyperplasia. A\nmorphological diagnosis of pyogranulomatous enteritis and vasculitis compatible with\nfeline infectious peritonitis (FIP) was made; however, owing to financial restraints\nand an unfavourable prognosis, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was not performed at this\nstage.\n\nFour days after surgery, the cat re-presented with anorexia and acute onset of\nrespiratory distress. Upon physical examination, tachypnoea (60 breaths/min) with\nmild expiratory effort and slightly pale mucous membranes were evident. On thoracic\nauscultation, a few crackles were audible bilaterally. The cat was hospitalised,\nplaced in an oxygen cage and administered intravenous furosemide (Diuren 1% 10 mg/ml\nsolution for injections [Teknofarma]: 1 mg/kg q6h initially, then 1 mg/kg q12h).\nAfter 12 h, a considerable amelioration of the clinical signs was seen.\n\nBy the following day, the respiratory rate and pattern normalised and therefore\nfurosemide was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 1 mg/kg q12h. Owing to the\nsuspicion of cardiac-related dyspnoea, an echocardiography was performed and\nrevealed left ventricular hypertrophy and bilateral atrial enlargement. Congestive\nheart failure (CHF) owing to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) was considered most\nlikely. Nevertheless, the cat started developing four-limb ataxia and weakness. A\ncomplete neurological examination was therefore carried out, which revealed ataxia\nand hypermetric gait on all four limbs and a mild decreased menace reflex\nbilaterally. Based on the findings, a cerebellar lesion was suspected. An ophthalmic\nevaluation revealed bilateral uveitis with anterior chamber opacity (worse on the\nleft eye); on examination of the fundus, retinal blood vessel oedema was\nevident.\n\nOwing to the worsening of the clinical signs and unfavourable long-term prognosis,\nthe cat was humanely euthanized and a post-mortem examination was performed. The\nlatter showed: an ileoileal termino-terminal surgical anastomosis; markedly enlarged\nmesenteric lymph nodes and spleen; diffusely enlarged and pale kidneys with\nmultifocal variably sized firm white nodules protruding from the cortex; well\ncircumscribed, firm white left lung lobe nodules of about 1 mm diameter with pleural\nthickening; a small amount of serohaemorrhagic pleural and pericardial fluid; and\nthickened myocardium with minimal mitral valve endocardiosis. Formalin-fixed\nparaffin-embedded 5 \u00b5m sections were prepared on polylysine-coated slides for\nroutine histological staining (haematoxylin and eosin) and for IHC. For the\ndemonstration of coronavirus in tissue, a mouse anti-coronavirus antibody (clone\nFCV3-70) was used as described previously.1 FIP lesions that tested positive for feline coronavirus (FCoV) antigen served\nas positive controls. For negative controls, consecutive sections were stained with\nan isotype-matched mouse non-specific antibody following the same protocol.1 Histopathology revealed pyogranulomatous infiltration involving several\norgans: adrenal glands, kidneys, lungs, brain, myocardium, lymph nodes and liver. In\nparticular, the myocardium fibres were markedly expanded by oedema and by multifocal\ninflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages (Figure 1). There was no\nevidence of the typical HCM histological findings, such as myofibre disarray,\nextensive interstitial fibrosis or focal endocardial thickening. The findings were\ncompatible with a diagnosis of FIP. IHC was performed on the myocardium (Figure 2) and revealed several\nFCoV-positive cells morphologically consistent with macrophages. A post-mortem\ndiagnosis of FCoV-associated myocarditis was finally made.\n\nFCoV is found worldwide and is over-represented in multi-cat households; it\nreplicates in enterocytes. FCoV infection is usually asymptomatic; however, it can\ncause transient mild or occasionally severe acute or chronic vomiting and/or\ndiarrhoea with weight loss that is unresponsive to supportive treatment.2\u20134 If the cat\u2019s macrophages fail to\neliminate the virus, it replicates within their cytoplasm and FIP\ndevelops.2,3\nFIP is a fatal, immune-mediated disease and is a common infectious cause of death in\ncats.2,3,5,6 The non-effusive form is\ncharacterised by the development of granulomatous lesions within the kidneys,\ncentral nervous system, eyes and parenchymatous organs (including the intestine,\nwhere ileocolic junction masses are common).3,7,8 The hallmark of the effusive\nform is the vasculitis-induced fluid accumulation in body cavities (pleural,\nperitoneal and pericardial).3,9,10 The clinical\npresentation described in our case report was compatible with what reported in\nliterature. However, the onset of CHF was unexpected and initially considered\nunrelated to FIP. It is worth mentioning that, in cats with FIP, some unusual\nmanifestations have been described, such as a mediastinal cyst-like mass in the\nthorax, skin fragility syndrome and other skin lesions, orchitis or priapism, while\nno FCoV-associated myocarditis has been described yet.11\u201316\n\nA definitive diagnosis of FIP is often challenging. A score system based on history,\nclinical signs, laboratory abnormalities and level of antibody titres has been\nsuggested in order to assess the likelihood of FIP.2,3 However, necropsy with histology\nand IHC are still considered the gold standards for the diagnosis of FIP.2,3,17\u201320 In the present case, necropsy\nrevealed pyogranulomatous infiltration of multiple organs, including the myocardium.\nFurthermore, the multifocal vasculocentric pattern of the intestinal wall lesions\nwould favour a monocyte-triggered spreading of the coronavirus to other organs\n(including the myocardium), as previously reported.1 IHC performed on the myocardial tissue confirmed the presence of\nFCoV-positive macrophages. Given the absence of morphological signs consistent with\nHCM, the thickening of the myocardium was explained by the presence of oedema and\ninflammatory infiltrates composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells and FCoV-positive\nmacrophages; therefore, a post-mortem diagnosis of FCoV-induced myocarditis, leading\nto the unusual re-presenting picture (CHF), was made. To the authors\u2019 knowledge,\nthis has never been reported before in the veterinary literature.\n\nMyocarditis is a form of myocardial disease characterised by the presence of\ninflammation in response to physical, chemical and infectious agents. Reports of\ndogs and cats with infectious myocarditis caused by systemic diseases, such as\nprotozoa (Trypanosoma cruzi, Hepatozoon species, Leishmania species,\nNeospora caninum, Toxoplasma gondii), viruses (FIV, parvovirus, West\nNile virus), bacteria (Bartonella species, Bacillus\npiliformis, Citrobacter koseri), spirochetes (Borrelia\nburgdorferi) and, in some cases, opportunistic fungi\n(Blastomyces species)21\u201334 have been described. To date,\nas far as the authors are aware, there have been no reports of FCoV as the cause of\nmyocarditis. Therefore, this cat represents the first published report that viruses\nother than parvovirus and FIV can cause myocarditis in cats. Furthermore, our\nconclusion is that FCoV-associated myocarditis led to the onset of CHF and to the\nunusual clinical manifestation.\n\nFCoV-associated myocarditis should be considered as a rare but possible differential\ndiagnosis in cats presenting with cardiac-related signs and other clinical signs\ncompatible with FIP. Histological examination, together with IHC, is needed to\nconfirm the diagnosis, as previously reported. Studies on a large cohort of cats are\nneeded to establish the prevalence of myocarditis in cats diagnosed with FIP."}
