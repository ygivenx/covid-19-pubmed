{"title": "Identification of SUMO E3 Ligase-Specific Substrates Using the HuProt Human Proteome Microarray", "body": "The functional protein microarray is a powerful and versatile systems biology and proteomics tool that allows the rapid activity profiling of thousands of proteins in parallel. Applications of functional protein microarrays range from the identification of proteinbinding properties, to surveying targets of posttranslational modifications, to uncovering novel enzymatic activities. Since the development of the yeast proteome microarray over 10 years ago [1] , more recent work has seen the development of complete and near-complete proteome arrays representing viruses, bacteria, and plants [2] [3] [4] . However, most existing human protein microarrays are comprised of only a minority of the human proteome [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . We have recently developed a human proteome microarray, the HuProt array, which includes nearly 20,000 full-length human proteins [10] . The proteins used to generate this microarray were expressed in yeast and purified under native conditions. Expressing recombinant eukaryotic proteins in yeast improves the likelihood that proteins will retain their biological activity relative to prokaryotic and in vitro expression systems.\n\nNumerous collaborations between our labs and others have so far harnessed the power of the HuProt array to profile a wide range of protein activities. The role of posttranslational modifications in regulating enzymatic activity is one area of investigation particularly well suited for the HuProt array platform. A screen to define the S-nitrosylated proteome revealed an important regulatory role for this posttranslational modification in the control of ubiquitin E3 ligase activity [11] . In other work, phosphorylation and glycosylation states of the protein kinase CK2 were shown to affect its substrate specificity [12] . The HuProt array has also been used in two separate studies to link novel protein-RNA interactions to neurological disease, including an interaction between RNA splicing factors and a long noncoding RNA linked to schizophrenia [13] and an interaction between multiple RNA binding proteins and an expanded repeat-containing transcript implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [14] . Another ongoing project in our labs is the generation of monospecific monoclonal antibodies whose specificity can be quickly evaluated using the HuProt array [10] . The utility of the HuProt array further extends to exciting clinical applications including the identification of novel biomarkers that may be used as a diagnostic tool in primary biliary cirrhosis, an autoimmune disease of the liver [15] .\n\nProtein SUMOylation is an essential posttranslational modification in most organisms, including yeast, C. elegans, Arabidopsis, and mice [16] . The reversible SUMO-modification of target proteins involves an enzymatic cascade chemically similar to ubiquitylation, involving E1 activating, E2 conjugating, E3 ligating enzymes and SUMO proteases. As the only classes of SUMOylation enzymes for which multiple members have been identified, the SUMO E3 ligases and the SUMO proteases have been proposed to be the major factors determining substrate specificity. Recently, we have conducted SUMOylation assays using the HuProt microarray to identify numerous previously uncharacterized SUMO E3 ligasedependent substrates using a subset of human SUMO E3 ligases. While our study focused on some of the best characterized SUMO E3 ligases, recently additional SUMO E3 ligases have been described [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] and it is likely that new SUMO E3 ligases await discovery [22] . The methods that we describe here could be used to identify substrates for these additional SUMO E3 ligases. For most SUMO E3 ligases, only a limited number of substrates are known. In this chapter, we will describe the on-chip SUMOylation protocol that we have developed so that the reader may conduct SUMOylation assays using the HuProt microarray with their SUMO E3 ligase of interest.\n\nMicroscope slide box (25-slide size).\n\nMicroarray analysis software, GenePix Pro 6.0 (MDS Analytical Technologies, USA).\n\nOrbital shaker.\n\nSUMO-1 affinity-purified mouse monoclonal antibody (21C7) (#33-2400, Life Technologies).\n\nDyLight 549 Antibody Labeling Kit (Pierce Biotechnology): DyLight NHS ester, 0.67 M borate buffer, purification resin, spin columns, microcentrifuge collection tubes.\n\nSUMO blocking buffer: 2 % BSA, 0.05 % Tween-20 in TBS.\n\n2\u00d7 SUMO conjugation buffer: 40 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM DTT.\n\nSUMO reaction mix (for 200 \u03bcl reaction): 100 \u03bcl 2\u00d7 SUMO conjugation buffer, 0.25-2.5 \u03bcM E1 enzyme, 0.07-7 \u03bcM E2 enzyme, 20 nM E3 ligase (see Note 2).\n\nTBST: 0.05 % Tween-20 in TBS.\n\n1 % SDS.\n\nStreak out colonies onto a LB + ampicillin agar plate from a glycerol stock of GST-SUMO in pGEX6p.1 in BL21 cells.\n\nPick a single colony and inoculate into 5 ml LB with ampicillin overnight at 37 \u00b0C.\n\nDilute the 5 ml culture into 50 ml LB with ampicillin culture overnight at 37 \u00b0C.\n\nDilute 50 ml culture into 1 l LB with ampicillin until the OD = 0.6, then drop the temperature to 20 \u00b0C and induce with 1 mM IPTG and shake overnight at 20 \u00b0C.\n\nFreeze pellet at \u221280 \u00b0C until ready to proceed with purification.\n\nThaw pellet at 37 \u00b0C, resuspend with 25 ml general lysis buffer, rotate at RT for 15 min.\n\nCentrifuge at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min at 20,000 \u00d7 g to pellet insoluble material.\n\nDuring centrifugation prepare glutathione sepharose by washing 2 ml 50 % glutathione sepharose with 1\u00d7 PBS in 50 ml tube.
