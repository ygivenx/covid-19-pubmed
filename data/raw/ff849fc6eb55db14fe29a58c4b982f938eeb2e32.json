{"title": "", "body": "T he 2020 Annual Meeting of the Arthroscopy Association of North America (AANA20) should be spectacular. The dates are May 7 through May 9. Hop a plane to Dallas-Fort Worth airport, only 10 minutes in the car, and you've arrived at the Gaylord Texan Resort and Convention Center.\n\nOur journals, Arthroscopy, Arthroscopy Techniques, and Arthroscopy, Sports Medicine, and Rehabilitation, will be in attendance in force. A few seats remain available for the Journal Course for Writers and Reviewers. Our invaluable Managing Editor Deborah VanNoy will be staffing the booth outside the plenary session hall and will be accompanied by a roving crew of editors. We'll be recording podcasts at the end of the daily sessions and recruiting reviewers at the Resident and Fellow Symposium. Editors and reviewers will be monitoring the podium presentations and looking forward to peer reviewing the original scientific investigations and innovative new techniques presented when they are ultimately submitted to our journals. Editor-in-Chief Lubowitz will also be doing his best Hamlet impersonationdto repair or not to repairdin a debate on the torn anterior cruciate ligament.\n\nProgram highlights and innovations include surgery simulcasts and \"Great Debates\" including Anterior cruciate ligament repair versus \"not\" versus all-inside reconstruction Single-versus double-row rotator cuff repair Meniscal root repair versus \"over-rated\" Biceps \"fix it\" versus \"let it fly\" versus subpectoral tenodesis Knee internal brace versus \"no evidence\" In preparation for these AANA20 Great Debates, we have created a suggested reading list on these topics (Table 1) .\n\nAward-winning papers will include Cole on rotator cuff repair with or without bone marrow aspirate concentrate augmentation, Verma on balloon subacromial spacer versus partial repair for massive rotator cuff tears, and Sherman on medial patellofemoral ligament repair versus reconstruction in children and adolescents. Unique Feature Lectures will be presented by Glimpsing what is \"On the Horizon\"dand perhaps over and beyonddwill be Murray, Wortman, Tauro, Farr, and Angelo. Keynote Guest Speaker, football coach, sports analyst, and author Lou Holtz will share his perspectives on overcoming hurdles through strategic goal setting.\n\nAt AANA20, participants can attend more than 20 Continuing Medical Education credits' worth of sessions on every joint we treatdand everything we do! A tribute to Program Chair Julie Dodds: Following in the sizable footsteps of program chairs who have preceded her, Editors' Note: At the time of this writing, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeon's annual meeting has been canceled due to COVID-19. At this time, AANA20 has not been canceled; hopefully, it will not. Either way, this editorial highlights the hot topics in arthroscopic and related surgery. Dr. Dodds takes AANA20 to a new level of interest, originality, and clinical relevance.\n\nSocially, the Welcome Reception in the exhibit hall, morning breakfasts, afternoon \"Devices and Desserts,\" and venerated coffee breaks allow meeting attendeesdfrom members to residents and fellows, to those dipping a toe in the AANA pooldto mix, mingle, reacquaint, and forge new friendships. A Golf Outing and Wine Tour add to the opportunity to achieve a celebrated work-life balance, as do the many features of the outdoorsy, family-friendly setting. And.did we mention those coffee breaks?\n\nWe'll be feting outgoing President Larry Field and welcoming incoming President Brian Cole. We eagerly anticipate Brian's introduction of Dr. Field (which is bound to include elements of humor) and, most of all, Larry's Presidential Address. Historically, the Introduction and the Presidential Address are highlights of the meeting for many; for those who are organizing their schedules, we certainly recommend starting by marking Brian's remarks and Larry's discourse on your calendars.\n\nEach month, we reach readers through our journals, editorials, and web sites. Each year, we love seeing you at our Annual Meeting. We look forward to learning along with you at AANA20.
