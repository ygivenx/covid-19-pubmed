{"title": "Macro Domain from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus\n(MERS-CoV) Is an Efficient ADP-ribose Binding Module", "body": "Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)2 outbreak in 2003 (1, 2), a newly discovered disease,\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), has been spreading from countries in the\nMiddle East to America (3\u20135). In the summer\nof 2015, MERS was reported in North East Asia (6\u20138). The causative agent of MERS was identified as an unknown\ncoronavirus (CoV) resembling SARS-CoV and referred to as Middle East respiratory\nsyndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) (9\u201312). MERS-CoV belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus and\npossesses a positive-strand RNA genome that encodes viral proteins essential to the\nlife cycle of the virus (13, 14). The mortality of MERS is 4-fold higher\nthan SARS (40% compared with 10%) (15). Since\nthe first case report in Saudi Arabia, MERS has been reported in more than 20\ncountries and has caused more than 400 deaths worldwide (9).\n\nCoVs utilize the RNA genome to encode structural proteins, including spike\nglycoprotein (S), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N). They encode a\nlarge number of non-structural proteins (NSPs) for rapid replication. A single large\nreplicase gene encodes all proteins involved in viral replication. The replicase\ngene contains two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode two\npolyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab; production of pp1ab requires a ribosomal frameshift to\ntranscribe the portion encoded by ORF1b (16).\nORF1a encodes viral proteases, main protease (Mpro, also called\n3CLpro), and papain-like protease (PLpro), which are\nresponsible for cleavage of the ORF1a and ORF1b gene products to produce functional\nNSPs.\n\nIn SARS-CoV, the largest NSP member, NSP3, is a multidomain protein containing the\nfollowing domains: N-terminal acidic domain, macro domain, SARS-unique domain,\nPLpro, nucleic acid-binding domain, marker domain (G2M),\ntransmembrane domain, and Y-domain (17). The\nMERS-CoV genome contains 16 NSPs (Fig. 1);\nexcept for 3CLpro and PLpro (18, 19), most of the functional\ndomains within the NSP3 in MERS-CoV remain structurally uncharacterized.\n\nThe macro domain is named after the non-histone motif of the histone variant\nmacroH2A, in which it was originally characterized (20\u201322), a protein module ubiquitous in eukaryotes, bacteria, and\narchaea. This domain is well known for its affinity to adenosine diphosphate\n(ADP)-ribose (23\u201325). Many\ncellular enzymes bearing macro domains within their structures interact with\npoly(ADP)-ribose (26\u201329).\nPoly(ADP)-ribosylation is a post-translational modification linked with DNA repair,\napoptosis, gene regulation, and protein degradation. Thus, macro domain-containing\nproteins and enzymes may play important roles in regulating various cellular\nprocesses (30). Surprisingly, the CoVs\nstudied so far and a few other viruses such as alphavirus, rubella virus, and\nhepatitis E virus possess macro domains in their genomes (16). In addition, some viral macro domains were found to have\nADP-ribose 1\u2033-phosphate phosphatase (ADRP) activity (31\u201333), which catalyzes the removal of phosphate\nfrom ADP-ribose 1\u2033-phosphate (Appr1p) to produce ADP-ribose. ADRP activity\nhas been reported in a yeast protein containing macro domain as well as AF1521\nprotein in Archaeoglobus fulgidus (23, 34, 35). The enzymatic activity of viral macro domains in\nprocessing Appr1p is low (33, 36\u201338) and appears to be\ndispensable for virus RNA synthesis (31). In\naddition, the mutant for the CoV mouse hepatitis virus A59 (MHV-A59), encoding a\nsingle amino acid substitution of a strictly conserved residue for ADRP activity,\nreplicated to slightly reduced titers in mouse liver but, strikingly, did not induce\nliver disease (39). The MHV macro domain\nexacerbates MHV-induced liver pathology, most likely by inducing excessive\ninflammatory cytokine expression. It was also reported that catalytic residues\nAsn-809, His-812, Gly-816, and Gly-817 for ADRP activity in hepatitis E virus macro\ndomain are critical for hepatitis E virus replication (40). Accordingly, the development of drugs targeting the viral\nmacro domain may be a strategy for antiviral therapy.\n\nThe macro domain of SARS-CoV NSP3 was previously reported to possess ADP-ribose and\npoly(ADP)-ribose binding ability, which suggests that the macro domain may regulate\ncellular proteins involved in an apoptotic pathway via poly(ADP)-ribosylation to\nmediate the host response to infection (36).\nStructural studies of macro domains from CoVs such as human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E) and\nfeline CoV (FCoV) also revealed interactions with ADP-ribose (41\u201343) and have offered huge advances in our\nunderstanding of viral macro domains. The MERS-CoV genome features a macro domain\nembedded in NSP3 (Fig. 1). However, we lack\nstructural and functional information regarding the MERS-CoV macro domain.\n\nIn the present study, we investigated the MERS-CoV macro domain as an ADP-ribose\nbinding module, with comparison to previously characterized viral macro domains.\nFurthermore, we determined the crystal structure of the MERS-CoV macro domain in\ncomplex with ADP-ribose. Structural comparison of MERS-CoV and other human CoVs\nrevealed divergence in ADP-ribose binding by macro domains. Our study may shed new\nlight on structurally based design of novel antiviral drugs targeting viral macro\ndomains.\n\nThe DNA sequence containing the MERS-CoV macro domain was synthesized by\na local biotechnology company (MDBio, Inc.) and cloned into the pUC57\nplasmid. The macro domain fragment was inserted between the NdeI and\nXhoI sites of the pET28a vector system (Novagen). The forward and\nreverse PCR primers used for amplification were macro-F\n(5\u2032-AATTCATATGCCACTGAGCAATTTTGAACA-3\u2032) and macro-R\n(5\u2032-AATTCTCGAGTTAGATGGTCAGGCTCTTATAC-3\u2032). The resulting\nplasmid with the inserted sequence was transformed into\nEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells, which were grown\nat 37 \u00b0C up to A600 1.0 with 50\n\u03bcg/ml of kanamycin. The expression of the recombinant MERS-CoV\nmacro domain with an His tag at the N terminus was induced in cells with\n1 mm isopropyl \u03b2-d-thiogalactoside, followed by\ngrowth for 20 h at 16 \u00b0C. Cells were collected by centrifugation\nand resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm phosphate buffer, pH\n7.0, 100 mm NaCl). After 20 min of sonication, the cell extract\nwas clarified by centrifugation at 18,900 \u00d7 g for\n30 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove debris. The clear supernatant was placed\nin an open column filled with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. The\nresin was washed with 10 times volume of lysis buffer containing 50 and\n100 mm imidazole, respectively. The His-tagged MERS-CoV macro\ndomain was eluted by lysis buffer containing 300 mm imidazole.\nThe purified MERS-CoV macro domain was dialyzed against stabilization\nbuffer (25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl,\n0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The His tag was removed by using\nthrombin, which resulted in four additional residues (GSHM) at the N\nterminus. The protein was further purified by gel filtration\nchromatography with a Superdex75 XK 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) in 20\nmm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl.\n\nFar-UV CD spectra were measured with 10 \u03bcm protein samples\nin CD buffer (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 3.5\u20138.5) placed\ninto a 1-mm path length cuvette and recorded on a JASCO J-810\nspectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature control system\n(JASCO International Co.). Thermal transition of protein samples with or\nwithout preincubation of 1 mm ADP-ribose were monitored at 220\nnm from 25 to 95 \u00b0C at a scan rate of 1 \u00b0C/min. Baseline\nsubtraction, smoothing, and data normalization involved the use of\nSigmaPlot. The melting temperature (Tm) was\ncalculated with the maximum of the first derivative of the CD\nsignal.\n\nThermal shift assay with DSF involved use of a CFX48 Real-time PCR\nDetection System (Bio-Rad). In total, a 25-\u03bcl mixture containing 2\n\u03bcl of SYPRO Orange (Sigma), 1.25 \u03bcl of dialysis buffer (20\nmm Tris-HCl, and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0), 10 \u03bcl\nof 1 \u03bcm protein sample, and various concentrations of\nADP-ribose were mixed on ice in an 8-well PCR tube. Fluorescent signals\nwere measured from 25 to 95 \u00b0C in 0.1 \u00b0C/30-s steps\n(excitation, 450\u2013490 nm; detection, 560\u2013580 nm). The main\nmeasurements were carried out in triplicate. Data evaluation and\nTm determination involved use of the\nBio-Rad CFX Manager, and data fitting and dissociation constant\n(Kd) calculations involved the use\nof SigmaPlot.\n\nBinding of ADP-ribose to the MERS-CoV macro domain was measured by ITC\nwith the Nano Isothermal Titration Calorimeter (TA Instruments).\nAliquots of 3 \u03bcl of 1.14 mm ADP-ribose were titrated by\ninjection into protein (0.057 mm in 0.98 ml) in 20 mm\nTris-HCl (pH 7.0) and 100 mm NaCl. Experiments were carried out\nat 25 \u00b0C with 250 rpm stirring. Background heat from ligand to\nbuffer titrations was subtracted, and the corrected heat from the\nbinding reaction was used to derive values for the stoichiometry of the\nbinding (n), Kd, apparent\nenthalpy of binding (\u0394H), and entropy change\n(\u0394S). Data were fitted by use of an\nindependent binding model with Launch NanoAnalyze version 2.3.6.\n\nThe MERS-CoV macro domain and ADP-ribose were mixed in a molar ratio of\n1:15. Initial protein crystallization trials were performed at 283 K by\nthe sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method with commercial crystallization\nscreen kits, 96-well Intelli-plates (Art Robbins Instruments), and a\nHoneyBee 963 robot (Genomic Solutions). Each crystallization drop was\nprepared by mixing 0.3 \u03bcl of macro domain/ADP-ribose at 10 mg/ml\nwith an equal volume of mother liquor, and the mixture was equilibrated\nagainst 100 \u03bcl of reservoir solution. The crystals for data\ncollection were grown in 1 week at 283 K with the optimal condition of\n100 mm phosphate/citrate (pH 4.2), 2.0 m ammonium\nsulfate, and 10 mm nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as the\nadditive. For subsequent anomalous phasing, the crystal was soaked for 8\nh in 3 mm mercuric(II) chloride, cryoprotected in mother liquor\nsupplemented with 20% glycerol, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen at\n100 K. The diffraction images were recorded in a 100-K nitrogen gas\nstream with use of BL13B1 or BL13C1 beamlines (National Synchrotron\nRadiation Research Center, Taiwan) and processed by using HKL2000\nsoftware (44).\n\nThe crystal structure of the MERS-CoV macro domain in complex with\nADP-ribose was solved by the mercury(II) derivative single-wavelength\nanomalous dispersion method by using SHELXD/SHELXE software (45). The initial model was refined\nby the maximum likelihood method implemented in REFMAC5 (46) as part of the CCP4 suite\n(47) and rebuilt\ninteractively by inspecting the \u03c3-weighted electron density maps\nwith coefficients 2mFo \u2212\nDFc and\nmFo \u2212\nDFc in COOT (48). During the later stages, restrained positional\nand B-factor refinement involved the program phenix.refine (49). Water molecules were manually\nadded at the final stages. The models were evaluated with use of\nPROCHECK (50) and MOLPROBITY\n(51). The data collection and\nstructure refinement statistics are in Table 1.\n\nThe MERS-CoV macro domain (pp1a residues 1110 to 1273) was expressed and\npurified from E. coli. The final purified protein was a\n167-amino acid protein (20 kDa), with four additional residues at the N\nterminus resulting from removal of the hexa-histidine tag after thrombin\ncleavage. CD spectra revealed that the macro domain exhibited a stable\n\u03b1/\u03b2-type folding pattern under various pH conditions (Fig. 2). The\nTm of the macro domain from thermal\ntransition monitored by CD was 43 \u00b0C. However, the addition of\nADP-ribose significantly increased the Tm to\n51 \u00b0C (Fig.\n3A). The significant increase in\nTm suggests the interaction between\nthe MERS-CoV macro domain and ADP-ribose.\n\nTo understand the affinity of ADP-ribose binding to the MERS-CoV macro\ndomain, both DSF and ITC measurements were used to examine the\nequilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of\nADP-ribose. After fitting DSF data, the Kd\nwas determined to be 3.12 \u00b1 0.42 \u03bcm\n(r2 = 0.9628) (Fig. 3B), which is similar to the\ncalculated Kd of 2.95 \u03bcm\nbased on ITC data (Fig.\n3C). In addition, ITC data indicated that\nADP-ribose bound to the MERS-CoV macro domain with favorable enthalpy\nchange (exothermic, \u0394H = \u221291.04 KJ/mol).\nThe binding reaction was spontaneous at 25 \u00b0C with exergonic Gibbs\nenergy of binding (\u0394G = \u221231.56 KJ/mol).\nThe thermodynamic profile (\u0394G < 0,\n\u0394H < 0, and\n\u2212T\u0394S > 0) of\nADP-ribose binding to the MERS-CoV macro domain suggests that ADP-ribose\nis likely stabilized by hydrogen bond formations (52).\n\nWe reviewed the results of previously reported binding assays of\nADP-ribose binding to CoV macro domains (Table 2). Compared with the Kd\nof ADP-ribose binding to macro domains of human CoVs such as SARS-CoV\n(24 \u03bcm) (36) and\nHCoV-229E (28.9 \u03bcm) (41) and animal coronaviruses such as FCoV (\u223c400\n\u03bcm) (42), our\nKd of 2.95 \u03bcm from\nbiochemical analysis suggests that the MERS-CoV macro domain is a more\nefficient ADP-ribose binding module. The SARS macro domain possesses\npoly(ADP)-ribose binding ability and may play a role in the host\nresponse to virus (36). We found\nthat the MERS-CoV macro domain interacts with ADP-ribose, which suggests\nfurther investigating the role of the macro domain in MERS-CoV\ninfection.\n\nWe determined the crystal structure of ADP-ribose-bound MERS-CoV macro\ndomain for further molecular elucidation. The orthorhombic crystals gave\ngood quality x-ray diffraction and belonged to the space group\nC2221 with the following unit cell dimensions:\na = 41.798 \u212b, b = 120.807\n\u212b, c = 67.659 \u212b, and \u03b1 = \u03b2 =\n\u03b3 = 90\u00b0. The structure of the MERS-CoV macro domain was\nsolved by mercury single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (see\n\u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d). The final protein structure\n(Fig. 4A) was\nrefined to 1.43-\u212b resolution with R-factor and\nR-free values of 0.1273 and 0.1619, respectively\n(Table 1). The core of the\nstructure of MERS-CoV macro domain is a seven-stranded \u03b2-sheet in\nthe order of\n\u03b21-\u03b22-\u03b27-\u03b26-\u03b23-\u03b25-\u03b24 (Fig. 4B). The\ncentral \u03b2-sheet is sandwiched between six \u03b1-helices, with\n\u03b11, \u03b12, and \u03b13 packing onto one face and \u03b14,\n\u03b15, and \u03b16 onto the other. In the initial refinement cycle,\na strong bent electron density (continuous at 1\u03c3 cutoff) (Fig. 4A) located at\nthe central pocket, was unambiguously identified as an ADP-ribose\nmolecule. This molecule is tightly bound in an uncharged crevice located\nat the C-terminal end of strands \u03b23 and \u03b26 in the loop\nregions between \u03b23-\u03b12 and \u03b26-\u03b15 (Fig. 4A).\n\nA search of the DALI database (53)\nwith the structure of the MERS-CoV macro domain in complex with\nADP-ribose used as a model revealed several structural homologs.\nTop-ranked structures were macro domains of CoVs in complex with\nADP-ribose such as those for SARS-CoV (PDB code 2FAV; Z score 27.9;\nr.m.s. deviation 1.3; sequence identity 45%; sequence similarity 65%)\n(36), HCoV-229E (PDB code\n3EWR; Z score 22.8; r.m.s. deviation\n1.8; sequence identity 33%; sequence similarity 56%) (43), FCoV (PDB code 3JZT, Z score 22.6; r.m.s. deviation\n1.8; sequence identity 30%; sequence similarity 53%) (42), and infectious bronchitis\nvirus (PDB code 3EWP; Z score 19.5; r.m.s. deviation 1.9; sequence\nidentity 28%; sequence similarity 47%) (43). This finding reflects that the viral macro domains are\nstructurally well conserved. However, variability between all these\nstructures arises from the loops connecting the core secondary structure\nelements, which display great diversity in sequence, length, and\nconformation and may correspond to different ADP-ribose binding\nability.\n\nTo gain insights into the molecular mechanism of ADP-ribose binding, we\nfurther investigated the binding pocket for ADP-ribose in the MERS-CoV\nmacro domain. The adenine moiety resides in the hydrophobic cavity\ncontaining Gly-19, Ala-21, Ile-47, Pro-123, Leu-124, and Val-152 (Fig. 5A).\nCoordination of ADP-ribose involves serial hydrogen bond formations and\nhydrophobic interactions provided by surrounding amino acid residues\n(Fig. 5B). The\nside chain of Asp-20 contacts the N-6 atom of the pyrimidine ring in\nadenine moiety via direct hydrogen bonding. This residue is critical for\nbinding specificity of the macro domain AF1521 in A.\nfulgidus (54).\nStructure-based multiple sequence alignment showed that this aspartic\nacid is conserved among CoV macro domains (Fig. 6A). Oxygen atoms of the pyrophosphate\nin ADP-ribose contact surrounding residues via hydrogen bonding with\nnitrogen atoms in backbone amides of Ile-47, Ser-126, Gly-128, Ile-129,\nand Phe-130. The second ribose is stabilized by complex hydrogen bonding\nwith surrounding residues and water molecules (Fig. 5A). The ribose-3\u2033\noxygen atom forms a hydrogen bond with a nitrogen atom in the side chain\nof Asn-38. The ribose-2\u2033 oxygen atom forms hydrogen bonds with\nthe oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the backbone amides of Lys-42 and\nGly-44, respectively. The ribose-1\u2033 oxygen atom forms a hydrogen\nbond with the nitrogen atom in the backbone amide of Gly-46. A water\nmolecule serves as a bridge between the ribose-1\u2033 oxygen atom,\nAsn-38, and His-43. This organization of the terminal ribose and\nsurrounding molecules was also observed in the yeast ADRP enzyme (34), which suggests that Asn-38 and\nHis-43 may be critical for the hydrolysis reaction of ADP-ribose\n1\u2033-phosphate to ADP-ribose. In addition, equivalent residues\ncritical for ADRP activity in the SARS-CoV macro domain (36) included Asn-35, Asn-38,\nHis-43, Gly-44, Gly-45, and Phe-130, which are conserved in the MERS-CoV\nmacro domain (Fig.\n6A). Conservation of catalytically\nsignificant residues of ADRP in the MERS-CoV macro domain indicates that\nthe MERS-CoV macro domain may possess ADRP enzymatic activity.\n\nThe structures of the macro domains of other CoVs pathogenic to humans,\nincluding SARS-CoV (36) and\nHCoV-229E (43), have been\ndetermined. Superposition of structures of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and\nHCoV-229E macro domains shows that the major structural divergence lies\nin the \u03b11 helices, which participates in stabilization of\nADP-ribose (Fig.\n6B). Of note, in terms of the ADP-ribose\nbinding pockets of the three structures, the structures of ADP-ribose\nappear at different degrees of curvature at the adenine moieties. In the\nMERS-CoV macro domain, the side chain of Asp-20 contacting ADP-ribose\npoints into the cavity that holds adenine moiety. In the SARS-CoV macro\ndomain, the side chain position of the equivalent residue, Asp-23,\nvaries significantly from that of Asp-20 in the MERS-CoV macro domain.\nThis variation in side chain positions for Asp residues may result from\ndifferent compositions of amino acids in the \u03b11 helix. In the\nMERS-CoV macro domain, Asp-20 forms two hydrogen bonds with the N-6 atom\nin a pyrimidine ring of ADP-ribose and nitrogen in the Ile-22 backbone\namide in the \u03b11 helix via the same oxygen atom on its side chain,\nthereby dragging the Asp-20 side chain into the adenine cavity. In\ncontrast, in the SARS-CoV macro domain, Asp-23 forms a hydrogen bond\nwith the N-6 atom of adenine via one of the oxygen atoms in its side\nchain and with nitrogen atoms in Val-25 and Lys-26 backbone amides via\nanother. Hydrogen bonding with Val-25 and Lys-26 of Asp-23 in the\nSARS-CoV macro domain causes a variation in side chain orientation from\nthat for Asp-20 in the MERS-CoV macro domain. Furthermore, in the\nMERS-CoV macro domain, the lengths of hydrogen bonds formed by the\nAsp-20 side chain with Ile-22 and ADP-ribose are 2.96 and 2.82 \u212b,\nrespectively. In the SARS-CoV macro domain, the lengths of hydrogen\nbonds formed by the Asp-23 side chain with Val-25 and ADP-ribose are\n3.04 and 2.87 \u212b, respectively (Fig.\n6C). The differential strength of hydrogen\nbonds formed by Asp with ADP-ribose and residues in the \u03b11 helix\nof the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV macro domains may result from the presence\nof different residues in \u03b11 helices that cause variations in side\nchain orientation of Asp residues in both structures. As compared with\nAsp-20 in MERS-CoV and Asp-23 in SARS-CoV, the equivalent residue in\nHCoV-229E is Asp-19, which does not contact ADP-ribose. Instead of\nforming a hydrogen bond directly with ADP-ribose, the side chain of\nAsp-19 in HCoV-229E contacts Thr-22 in the \u03b11 helix via hydrogen\nbonding with oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the side chain and backbone of\nThr-22, respectively. Hydrogen bonding with Thr-22 drags the side chain\nof Asp-19 in the HCoV-229E macro domain away from the adenine cavity as\ncompared with the position of Asp-20 in the MERS-CoV macro domain (Fig. 6D). Consistent\nwith the previous study, the thermodynamic profile\n(\u0394G < 0, \u0394H < 0,\nand \u2212T\u0394S < 0) of\nADP-ribose binding to the HCoV-229E macro domain suggests less\ncontribution of the hydrogen bond to stabilization of ADP-ribose (41) (Table 2). Variations in strength of the hydrogen\nbond and orientation of the side chain in Asp residues may result in\ndifferential binding affinities of ADP-ribose observed in macro domains\nof MERS-CoV (Kd 2.95 \u03bcm),\nSARS-CoV (Kd 24 \u03bcm) (36), and HCoV-229E\n(Kd 28.9 \u03bcm) (41). The relationship between\nbinding affinities of ADP-ribose in macro domains and differential\npathogenicity of human CoVs needs further investigation.\n\nTaken together, our biochemical study shows higher binding affinity for\nADP-ribose in the MERS-CoV macro domain than macro domains of CoVs\ncharacterized to date. Structural analysis revealed that differences in\nthe context of hydrogen bonds formed by the conserved Asp with\nADP-ribose and residues in \u03b11 helices in macro domains of\nMERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and HCoV-229E may result in differential binding\naffinities for ADP-ribose. Our studies provide a biochemical basis for\nfurther investigating the role of macro domain in MERS-CoV infection and\nalso the precise structural information for the design of novel\nantiviral drugs.\n\nC.
