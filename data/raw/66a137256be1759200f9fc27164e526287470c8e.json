{"title": "Overview of the minimum sampling threshold for outbreaks seeded in Devon, Cumbria and Aberdeenshire for all sampling methods", "body": ": Summary of the minimum sampling threshold S min after 12 weeks for random movement sampling (RMS), snowball node sampling (SBS) and targeted node sampling (TNS) without markets and S min after one infectious period with markets for epidemics seeded in Cumbria, Devon and Aberdeen. Parameters were \u03b2 = 1 and T = 21 days. For TNS the number of movements a farm needs in order top be sampled is given in parentheses.\n\nSupplementary figures for Cumbria \u03b2 = 1, T = 21 days Figure SI 8: Epidemic measurements for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria using the RMS method with \u03b2 = 1 and T = 21 days. Plot a) shows the mean epidemic size in weekly intervals with ascending contours representing the epidemic size progression through time in weeks, the size after 6 (red) and 12 (blue) weeks are highlighted for reference. Plot b) shows the mean epidemic duration in weeks with 95% confidence intervals. Plot c) shows the mean peak size of the epidemic with 95% confidence intervals. Figure SI 9: Epidemic measurements for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria using the RNS method with \u03b2 = 1 and T = 21 days. Plot a) shows the mean epidemic size in weekly intervals with ascending contours representing the epidemic size progression through time in weeks, the size after 6 (red) and 12 (blue) weeks are highlighted for reference. Plot b) shows the mean epidemic duration in weeks with 95% confidence intervals. Plot c) shows the mean peak size of the epidemic with 95% confidence intervals. Figure SI 10: Epidemic measurements for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria using the SBS method with \u03b2 = 1 and T = 21 days. Plot a) shows the mean epidemic size in weekly intervals with ascending contours representing the epidemic size progression through time in weeks, the size after 6 (red) and 12 (blue) weeks are highlighted for reference. Plot b) shows the mean epidemic duration in weeks with 95% confidence intervals. Plot c) shows the mean peak size of the epidemic with 95% confidence intervals. Figure SI 11: Epidemic measurements for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria using the TNS method with \u03b2 = 1 and T = 21 days. Plot a) shows the mean epidemic size in weekly intervals with ascending contours representing the epidemic size progression through time in weeks, the size after 6 (red) and 12 (blue) weeks are highlighted for reference. Plot b) shows the mean epidemic duration in weeks with 95% confidence intervals. Plot c) shows the mean peak size of the epidemic with 95% confidence intervals. "}
