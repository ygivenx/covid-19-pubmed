{"title": "Impact of viral infections in children with community\u2010acquired pneumonia: results of a study of 17 respiratory viruses", "body": "Despite the development of effective antimicrobial therapy, management guidelines, and effective vaccines, community\u2010acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains one of the major causes of morbidity in children living in developed countries, and one of the main causes of mortality in those living in the developing world.\n1\n, \n2\n, \n3\n Detailed information concerning the etiology of CAP is required in order to formulate treatment recommendations and implement preventive measures. Evaluating the relative importance of each potential pathogen may also contribute to improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease.\n\nViruses have long been considered the predominant pathogens of CAP, particularly in infants and children aged <5 years.\n4\n, \n5\n However, because of the limited sensitivity and specificity of previous virological diagnostic techniques based on cultures or immunofluorescence microscopy and the measurement of antibody responses in paired serum samples, a considerable number of CAP cases were not etiologically identified. Recent advances in molecular diagnosis have made it possible to detect previously unknown viral agents and define the epidemiology of the most common respiratory viral infections more precisely,\n6\n but there are still many unanswered questions concerning the role of viruses in pediatric CAP. Little is known about the real prevalence of some viral infections, particularly those that have been identified more recently, and the frequency and importance of viral co\u2010infections have not been fully clarified. In order to answer these questions, there is a need for studies using methods that allow the identification of the greatest number of potential viral respiratory pathogens.\n\nThe aim of this study was to describe the data collected from children with radiographically confirmed CAP in whom 17 respiratory viruses were detected in respiratory secretion samples using the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) Fast assay during the acute phase of the disease.\n\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy, and was carried out in the Department of Maternal and Pediatric Sciences of the University of Milan between November 1 and April 30 of four consecutive winter and early spring seasons (2007\u20132008, 2008\u20132009, 2009\u20132010, and 2010\u20132011). The written informed consent of a parent or legal guardian was required, and the older children were asked to give their assent.\n\nAll of the children aged between 1 month and 14 years seen in the emergency room (ER) of the Department of Maternal and Pediatric Sciences who had fever (an axillary temperature of >38\u00b0C), and signs and symptoms consistent with CAP (i.e., cough, tachypnea, dyspnea or respiratory distress, and breathing with grunting or wheezing sounds with rales), were considered eligible for the study. The exclusion criteria were chronic diseases increasing the risk of respiratory infections, including premature birth; chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems, including asthma; chronic metabolic diseases, including diabetes mellitus; neoplasia; kidney or liver dysfunction; hemoglobinopathies; immunosuppression; diseases requiring long\u2010term aspirin therapy; and genetic or neurological disorders. The children with presumed nosocomial CAP (i.e., appearing more than 48 hours after admission or within 2 weeks of hospital discharge) were also excluded.\n\nAll of the chest X\u2010rays were evaluated by an independent expert radiologist who classified the findings as alveolar pneumonia, non\u2010alveolar pneumonia, or no pneumonia in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for a standardized interpretation of pediatric chest radiographs for the diagnosis of pneumonia.\n7\n Alveolar pneumonia was defined as dense opacity appearing as the fluffy consolidation of a part or all of a lobe or entire lung, often containing air revealed by bronchography, and sometimes associated with pleural effusion.\n7\n\n\n\nRespiratory secretion samples were taken from the enrolled children with radiographically confirmed CAP using a pernasal nylon flocked swab and stored in a tube of UTM\u2010RT (Cat. No. 360c; Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy).\n8\n, \n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n Upon enrollment, detailed information regarding their demographic data, clinical history, and the clinical characteristics of the disease was collected together with a blood sample for the evaluation of laboratory variables, including white blood cell counts, C\u2010reactive protein (CRP), and a blood culture. The drug treatment was chosen by the pediatrician in charge on the basis of the guidelines of the Italian Society of Pediatrics.\n13\n Children with mild disease were sent home with detailed therapeutic instructions and a recommendation to return to the hospital in the case of persistent fever or worsening respiratory symptoms and signs. The children with severe disease or family problems were hospitalized.\n\nThe clinical data collected during hospitalization were recorded daily, and all of the children (whether hospitalized or sent home immediately after enrollment) were re\u2010evaluated 15 \u00b1 2 days later by means of interviews and clinical examinations were carried out by trained investigators using standardized questionnaires that also collected information regarding household illnesses and related morbidities.\n\nViral RNA or DNA was extracted from the respiratory secretions by means of a Nuclisens EasyMAG automated extraction system (Biomeri\u00e9ux, Craponne, France) and was then tested using the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) Fast assay in accordance with the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada). All of the xTAG RVP Fast reagents were provided by Abbott GmBH & Co. (Wiesbaden\u2010Delkenheim, Germany). The RVP Fast assay consisted of a single multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with labeled primers, followed by the single\u2010step hybridization of the PCR products with the fluorescent bead array and incubation with the reagents. The plate was then analyzed using a Bio\u2010Plex 200 System (Bio\u2010rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy) and its associated software Luminex xPONENT version 3\u00b71 (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics Inc., provided by Abbott), and its median fluorescent intensity (MFI) was determined. An MFI above the threshold level determined by the manufacturer for a particular target indicated a positive result for that target. The mean fluorescence intensities establishing positivity were established using Tag\u2010It data analysis software (TDAS, Luminex).\n\nThe RVP Fast assay simultaneously detects influenza A virus (subtypes H1 or H3), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\u2010A and \u2010B, parainflunzavirus\u20101, \u20102, \u20103, and \u20104, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1, enterovirus/rhinovirus, and human bocavirus.\n14\n, \n15\n The assay also tests an internal positive control added to each specimen at the extraction stage (Escherichia coli phage MS2 RNA) and a positive run control added to each plate (bacteriophage lambda DNA).\n\nThe enterovirus/rhinovirus\u2010positive samples were retested in order to identify the rhinovirus. This real\u2010time PCR assay was performed using the iAg\u2010Path\u2010ID one\u2010step RT\u2010PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), and the primers and probe sequences were those reported by Lu et al.\n\n16\n Briefly, each 25 \u03bcl reaction mixture contained 1 \u03bcm of forward and reverse primers, 0\u00b71 \u03bcm of the probe, and 5 \u03bcl of nucleic acid extract. Amplification was performed using a 7900 HT Fast Real\u2010Time PCR detection system (Applied Biosystems) and the following thermocycling conditions: 10 min at 48\u00b0C for RT, 3 min at 95\u00b0C for polymerase activation, and then 45 cycles of 15 seconds at 95\u00b0C and 1 minutes at 60\u00b0C. Each run included template and non\u2010template controls.\n\nDescriptive statistics were generated. The continuous variables are given as mean values \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) and were analyzed using a two\u2010sided, non\u2010parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test or, when the data were normally distributed (on the basis of the Shapiro\u2013Wilk statistic), a two\u2010sided Student\u2019s t\u2010test; the categorical variables are given as absolute numbers and percentages, and were compared between groups using contingency table analysis and the chi\u2010square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test as appropriate. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to measure the associations between positivity for the selected viruses and (i) the presence of fever, (ii) hospitalization, (iii) the presence of rales, (iv) the presence of wheezes, (v) having a relative with a similar illness, and (vi) radiological evidence of alveolar pneumonia. The ORs were obtained using unconditional multiple logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age (<1, 1\u20133, and \u22654 years) and gender. We also analyzed the association between the presence of more than one viral infection and the same clinical and radiological characteristics, once again adjusting for age and gender. All of the analyses were made using sas version 9.1 (Cary, NC, USA).\n\nDuring the 4 years of the study, of the 592 children (311 boys; mean age \u00b1 SD 3\u00b72 \u00b1 3\u00b70 years) with radiographically confirmed CAP, 435 (73\u00b75%) were positive for at least one virus. Viruses were detected in 120/132 children aged <1 year (90\u00b79%), 235/293 aged 1\u20133 years (80\u00b72%), and 89/167 aged \u22654 years (47\u00b79%; P < 0\u00b705 versus the <1 year and 1\u20133 year age groups). Nine children (all negative for respiratory viruses) had positive blood cultures (six for Streptococcus pneumoniae, two for Staphylococcus aureus, and one for non\u2010typeable Haemophilus influenzae). As a preliminary analysis of the prevalence of respiratory viruses showed that there were no statistically significant differences by year of sample collection, all of the data collected in the 4 years were considered together.\n\n\nTable 1 shows the viral findings by age group and the presence of viral\u2013viral co\u2010infections. The most frequently detected virus was RSV, which was found in 188 children (31\u00b77%), followed by rhinovirus (n = 144, 24\u00b73%), bocavirus (n = 60, 10\u00b71%), influenza viruses (n = 57, 9\u00b76%: six seasonal A/H1N1, 17 A/H3N2, eight B, and 26 pandemic A/H1N1), hMPV (n = 49, 8\u00b72%), coronaviruses (n = 33, 5\u00b76%: 20 OC43, five 229E, five NL63, and three HKU1), enterovirus (n = 21, 3\u00b75%), adenovirus (n = 11, 1\u00b78%), and parainfluenza viruses (n = 11, 1\u00b78%: seven parainfluenza\u20104, one parainfluenza\u20101, one parainfluenza\u20102, and one parainfluenza\u20103). Among the children aged 4\u201314 years, rhinovirus was the most common cause of infection.\n\nAll of the studied viruses were found as isolated agents and in co\u2010infections. The incidence of co\u2010infections decreased with age and was significantly lower in the children aged 4\u201314 years (10/80, 12\u00b75%) than in those aged <1 year (42/120, 35\u00b70%; P < 0\u00b705) or 1\u20133 years (65/235, 27\u00b77%; P < 0\u00b705). The virus causing the highest percentage of co\u2010infections involved coronavirus, which was found together with other viruses in 26/33 children (78\u00b78%), followed by bocavirus (45/60, 75%), parainfluenza viruses (6/11, 54\u00b75%), adenovirus (6/11, 54\u00b75%), enterovirus (11/21, 52\u00b73%), rhinovirus (66/144, 45\u00b78%), RSV (76/188, 40\u00b74%), hMPV (11/49, 22\u00b74%), and influenza viruses (9/57, 15\u00b78%).\n\n\nTable 2 summarizes the viral co\u2010infections found in 117 children (19\u00b77% of the enrolled children and 26\u00b79% of those with viral infections): 96 were infected by two, 20 by three, and one by four viruses. The most common co\u2010infections were those involving RSV and rhinovirus (32 cases, 27\u00b73%), rhinovirus and bocavirus (11 cases, 9\u00b74%), RSV and coronavirus (11 cases, 9\u00b74%), and RSV and bocavirus (10 cases, 8\u00b75%).\n\n\nTable 3 describes the characteristics of the CAP associated with single viral infections. In order to be able to evaluate sufficiently substantial numbers, we only compared the single infections detected in at least 15 cases. Analysis of the differences between infections owing to RSV, rhinovirus, influenza, hMPV, and bocavirus showed that the mean age of the children with RSV\u2010positive CAP was significantly lower than that of those with rhinovirus\u2010 or influenza\u2010positive CAP (P < 0\u00b705); high\u2010grade fever (\u226539\u00b0C) was significantly more frequent among the children with hMPV\u2010positive CAP than among those with rhinovirus\u2010positive CAP (P < 0\u00b705); and rales were significantly more frequent among the children with RSV\u2010, hMPV\u2010, and bocavirus\u2010positive CAP than among those with rhinovirus\u2010positive CAP (P < 0\u00b705). Influenza\u2010positive CAP cases showed similar diseases among family members significantly more often than the rhinovirus\u2010 and bocavirus\u2010positive cases (P < 0\u00b705). There were no other between\u2010group differences in terms of clinical presentation or outcomes.\n\nAmong the laboratory parameters, CRP levels were significantly higher in the rhinovirus\u2010positive cases than in the RSV\u2010 and influenza\u2010positive cases (P < 0\u00b705); there were no differences in white blood cell counts.\n\nIn relation to the radiographic findings, alveolar pneumonia was significantly more frequent in the rhinovirus\u2010positive cases than in the influenza\u2010 and hMPV\u2010positive cases (P < 0\u00b705).\n\nMultivariate analysis showed that the rhinovirus\u2010positive cases were significantly less frequently associated with fever (OR 0\u00b737, 95% CI 0\u00b721\u20130\u00b763), rales (OR 0\u00b737, 95% CI 0\u00b721\u20130\u00b763), or a similar illness among family members (OR 0\u00b737, 95% CI 0\u00b719\u20130\u00b772) than rhinovirus\u2010negative cases. On the contrary, hMPV\u2010positive cases were significantly more frequently associated with fever (OR 3\u00b711, 95% CI 1\u00b724\u20137\u00b780) than hMPV\u2010negative cases, and influenza\u2010positive cases were significantly more frequently associated with a similar illness among family members (OR 3\u00b724, 95% CI 1\u00b770\u20136\u00b720) and significantly less frequently associated with alveolar pneumonia (OR 0\u00b738, 95% CI 0\u00b718\u20130\u00b780) than influenza\u2010negative cases.\n\n\nTable 4 shows the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiographic variables associated with the single viral infections and co\u2010infections. The only significant differences were mean age (which was significantly higher in the children with a single viral infection than in those with co\u2010infections) (P < 0\u00b7001), and the radiographic finding of alveolar pneumonia, which was significantly more frequent in the children with co\u2010infections (P < 0\u00b705). Multivariate analysis showed that the only significant association was the significantly more frequent radiographic evidence of alveolar pneumonia in the children with co\u2010infections than in those with single infections (OR 1\u00b772, 95% CI 1\u00b705\u20132\u00b781).\n\nWe used a combination of two molecular methods to identify 17 viruses in upper respiratory tract secretions in order to evaluate the relationships between viral infections and the development of CAP in a considerable number of otherwise healthy infants and children. The enrollment of a large number of pediatric patients was facilitated by the use of pernasal nylon flocked swabs, which are significantly less invasive than nasopharyngeal aspirates and washes, and a valid alternative means of collecting secretions for the detection of respiratory viruses, particularly when used with molecular assays.\n8\n, \n9\n, \n10\n, \n11\n, \n12\n To the best of our knowledge, we evaluated more respiratory viruses (including recently identified viruses) in children with CAP than ever before, thus improving our understanding of the role of individual viruses and viral co\u2010infections. The data not only confirm the importance of viruses in determining pediatric CAP previously highlighted by a number of authors, but also suggest that viruses may play an even greater role than previously thought as more than 75% of the children had a viral respiratory infection, including more than 90% of those aged <12 months. Previous studies have always found lower percentages and have therefore underestimated the real importance of viruses in pediatric CAP, probably because they sought a smaller number of viruses.\n17\n, \n18\n, \n19\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n22\n, \n23\n, \n24\n, \n25\n\n\n\nRSV and rhinovirus were the most common pathogens associated with CAP in the form of single viral infections and co\u2010infections. They were found alone in more than 50% of the cases, thus highlighting their role as the causes of pediatric CAP and underlining the need to develop safe and effective vaccines in order to face the clinical problems they may give rise to. This seems to be particularly important in the case of rhinovirus which, until a few years ago, was considered only relatively important, was rarely associated with CAP, and was not usually included in the evaluation of CAP etiology.\n1\n\n\n\nThe most frequently identified of the recently discovered viruses were bocavirus and hMPV. The data regarding bocavirus are quite similar to those reported by Fry et al.\n\n26\n and Don et al.,\n27\n who found it in about 12% of children with CAP in, respectively, Thailand and Italy. However, as observed in other studies,\n28\n, \n29\n, \n30\n it was mainly found in association with other viruses that are often detected singly (particularly RSV and rhinovirus). This suggests that bocavirus may not play a primary role as a cause of CAP, and that its presence in respiratory secretions is owing to a previous infection followed by prolonged low\u2010level viral shedding. Furthermore, in a previous study of children with respiratory diseases and bocavirus infection, we found that the most severe clinical pictures were diagnosed in children suffering from co\u2010infections, whereas most of the cases associated with a single bocavirus infection were very mild.\n31\n\n\n\nThe role played by hMPV seems to be more important. Its overall frequency was quite similar to that of bocavirus, but it was detected in association with other viruses in only about 22% of the cases, which is quite similar to that found by Wolf et al.\n\n23\n in a study carried out in Israel. This suggests that the virus may play a direct pathogenic role in the development of CAP.\n\nInfluenza viruses were the fourth most frequently detected infectious agents in children with CAP and showed the lowest incidence of co\u2010infections. This confirms the importance of these viruses even in lower respiratory tract infections and once again underlines the need for annual vaccine administration.\n32\n, \n33\n, \n34\n\n\n\nThe global incidence of infections owing to coronaviruses was 5\u00b76%, higher than that found in a large pneumonia study carried out in Thailand.\n26\n However, the fact that all of the coronaviruses were mainly found in association with other viruses suggests that both the old and new viruses are only relatively important in pediatric CAP. Consequently, despite the discovery of new coronaviruses, effective preventive measures do not seem to be urgently needed. The same seems to be true in the case of enterovirus, which was found in a very small number of cases and was very frequently associated with other viruses.\n\nAdenovirus and parainfluenza virus were identified in a very small number of cases. Previous studies have found that the frequency of identifying adenovirus can vary from 3% to 10%.\n5\n Although its prevalence is always relatively low, virus should be systematically monitored because it has been associated with severe and fatal necrotising pneumonia.\n17\n The incidence of parainfluenza virus infection was significantly lower than that observed in previous studies,\n5\n a finding that may have been at least partially due differences in the methods used to identify the viruses and the fact that we looked for a larger number of infectious agents. In most cases, they were found in association with other viruses, thus suggesting their only relative clinical importance.\n\nCo\u2010infections were very common, and it was not possible to define precisely the role of each pathogen as a cause of CAP in co\u2010infected children. However, although higher among the most frequently isolated viruses, the prevalence of co\u2010infections was not strictly related to the absolute prevalence of the individual viruses because it was higher in the case of coronaviruses, parainfluenza viruses, enterovirus, and adenovirus than RSV, rhinovirus, and influenza viruses, even though these last were detected in significantly more children. This finding contrasts with the hypothesis of Cilla et al.,\n19\n who suggested that the percentage of co\u2010infections owing to each virus is owing to its circulation in comparison with the other viruses and seems to indicate that other factors may play a role in favouring concomitant multiple viral infections in the same subject.\n\nInterestingly, only marginal differences were found in the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiographic variables associated with the single viral infections. Although there were significant differences in the individual variables associated with a specific virus, the variability of the data makes it impossible to define a characteristic picture of the CAP cases associated with each virus. Furthermore, there were no difference between the viruses in terms of the clinical variables indicating disease severity (i.e., the rate and duration of hospitalization and drug use), which suggests that the early use of antiviral therapy in CAP cases associated with influenza viruses should be limited in the absence of virological assays. It also highlights the importance of epidemiological surveillance and the use of molecular (or at least rapid) tests in individual patients, in order to ensure that antiviral drugs are only used in the few cases in which they are indicated.\n35\n, \n36\n\n\n\nComparison of the characteristics of the single viral infections and co\u2010infections showed that the only significant difference was the association between alveolar pneumonia and viral co\u2010infections. As the clinical and laboratory data (including white blood cell counts and CRP concentrations) do not suggest bacterial super\u2010infection, this finding may be explained by the synergistic role of more than one virus in causing lung inflammation and the consequent radiographic changes. On the other hand, non\u2010alveolar CAP was similarly or more prevalent than alveolar pneumonia in the children with single viral infections.\n\nThis study has two limitations. First of all, identifying viruses in the upper respiratory secretions of children with CAP may not indicate that they are really involved in causing the disease because it may only indicate a coincidental upper airways infection or be due to a carrier state or the prolonged shedding of a pathogen that caused a previous infection. However, viruses are generally detected in no more than 5% of asymptomatic subjects, although the prevalence of rhinovirus can be as high as about 15%.\n19\n Given the prevalence of each viral infection in our children, it is highly likely that the detected viruses played an important pathogenic role in determining CAP in most cases. However, as it has been demonstrated that viral/bacterial co\u2010infections are common, it is possible that the CAP cases attributed to viruses by us were at least partially owing to concomitant viral and bacterial infections. The higher CRP levels and the greater frequency of alveolar CAP observed in rhinovirus\u2010positive cases than in RSV\u2010 and influenza\u2010positive cases may indicate a greater degree of bacterial involvement in some viral infections. We systematically performed blood cultures for all of the enrolled children in order to identify bacterial infections but, because this procedure is not very sensitive, most of the cases were negative. It is therefore not possible to draw any conclusions concerning the real incidence of viral/bacterial co\u2010infections or to evaluate the importance of each virus in favouring bacterial super\u2010infections. On the other hand, although it may be useful to culture sputum in order to identify respiratory bacteria responsible for CAP,\n37\n we decided not to do so because the importance of collecting sputum from children is widely debated and, even when complicated and uncomfortable procedures are used (including pharmacological pre\u2010treatment, saline aerosol, and nasal aspiration), only some of the specimens are considered adequate.\n38\n\n\n\nThe second limitation is related to the fact that the study was conducted in the winter and early spring, and so it may have overestimated the role of infectious agents that only circulate during this period or underestimated viruses that have a prevalent circulation in other months. Our organization in the ER does not allow active specimen collection from all CAP cases during a whole year.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of respiratory viruses (mainly RSV and rhinovirus) in pediatric CAP, suggest that the only recently discovered respiratory virus frequently associated with CAP as a single infectious agent is hMPV, show marginal differences in the characteristics of the single viral infections, and demonstrate that viral co\u2010infections are more often associated with alveolar pneumonia than single viral infections in the absence of differences in other clinical or laboratory parameters. This information is important in the management of pediatric CAP and should help to define the infectious agents that need to be prevented and for which vaccines could be developed.\n\nS.E. and N.P. designed the study and co\u2010wrote the manuscript.
