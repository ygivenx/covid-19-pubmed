{"title": "Characterization of the diffuse mucosal associated lymphoid tissue of feline small intestine 4 2 7 ( 0 0 ) 0 0 1 8 1 -1", "body": "The mucosa of the small intestine constitutes one of the larger compartments of the lymphoid system and is composed of both diffuse and organized lymphoid tissue (Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993) . The diffuse mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is anatomically divided into the intra-epithelial compartment (IEC) and the lamina propria compartment (LPC). Leukocytes derived from each compartment have been differentiated by anatomical location as well as phenotype and function, thus de\u00aening a compartmentalization unique to the mucosal immune system (Lundqvist et al., 1995) .\n\nThe lymphocyte subpopulation of the IEC, the intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs), have been extensively characterized in mouse (Lefrancois, 1991; Maloy et al., 1991; Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993) , rat (Vaage et al., 1990; Fangmann et al., 1991; Takimoto et al., 1992; Santhi and Ramanadham, 1995; Kearsey and Stadnyk, 1996; Helgeland et al., 1997) , and man (Spencer et al., 1989; Jarry et al., 1990; Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993; Machado et al., 1994; Lundqvist et al., 1995) . Morphologically, a large percentage of IELs have intracytoplasmic azurophilic granules containing granzymes and perforin (Cerf-Bensussan and Guy-Grand, 1991; Mowat and Viney, 1997) . Phenotypically, the majority of IELs are T cells with CD3/CD8 phenotype (Cerf-Bensussan and Guy-Grand, 1991; Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993; Mowat and Viney, 1997) . A majority of IELs also co-express CD103, the aEb7 integrin required for homing and retention of lymphocytes in the mucosal epithelium (Cepek et al., 1994) . However, considerable phenotypic heterogeneity has been observed in IELs where CD4/CD8 (DP), CD4\u00c0/CD8\u00c0 (DN) T cells and unusual subpopulations such as CD3\u00c0/CD8 and CD4/CD8aa lymphocytes are described (Lefrancois, 1991; Maloy et al., 1991; Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993; Mowat and Viney, 1997) . Reasons for heterogeneity in this mucosal lymphoid pool are not well understood. However, this phenotypic diversity displayed by mucosal IELs is likely a re\u00afection of the range of functions performed by IELs as the \u00aerst line of defence against mucosal antigens, and is attributed to in\u00afuences from both the intestinal local environment and the intestinal epithelium.\n\nAlthough research has focused mainly on IEL biology, the lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) are also directly associated with in\u00afammatory (Souza et al., 1996) , hypersensitivity (Mowat and Viney, 1997) and HIV-1 associated intestinal disorders (Zeitz et al., 1994; Snijders et al., 1996) . Although studied less extensively, LPLs have less phenotypic heterogeneity compared with IELs (Schieferdecker et al., 1992) . However, a majority of LPLs in humans are reported to co-express molecules consistent with either activation, memory (James, 1991; Zeitz et al., 1991; Schieferdecker et al., 1992) or cytotoxic activity (Zeitz et al., 1991) and appear primed for cytokine production and response (Targan et al., 1995) .\n\nInterest in the mucosal lymphoid tissue of the domestic cat has grown as a comparative spontaneous and experimental animal model for various human diseases including in\u00afammatory bowel disease, viral and non-viral associated intestinal lymphomas (Callanan et al., 1996; Jackson et al., 1996) , and immunode\u00aeciency associated syndromes (Beebe et al., 1994) . The intestinal mucosal barrier and presumably, the MALT, also have a role in the pathogenesis of feline corona virus infection and the resultant development of feline infectious peritonitis (Pedersen et al., 1981) . However, characterization of feline normal intestinal MALT has not been reported. In this study,\u00afow cytometry, immunohistology and cytology were used to characterize the diffuse MALT of the small intestine in normal cats. Additionally, we describe the distribution and expression of the novel leukointegrin CD11d (Danilenko et al., 1995) in the feline MALT. The most striking \u00aendings in this study were the elevated percentages of CD8a T cells, presumed to express CD8aa chains, and CD4\u00c0/CD8\u00c0 (double negative) lymphocytes in the IEC, and the consistent presence of a minor subpopulation of CD3/CD11d IELs. This contrasts with salient phenotypic characteristics of the feline LPL population which included increased percentages of CD4 T cells, reduced numbers of CD8 T cells, presumed to express both CD8a and b chains, and minimal expression of CD11d.\n\nNormal small intestine was obtained from 22 speci\u00aec pathogen free cats (Feline Nutritional Laboratory, University of California at Davis, CA), comprised of nine juvenile (5\u00b18 months age) and 13 adult (over 1 year age) animals. Intestinal samples were collected after sacri\u00aece by intravenous injection of 10 ml saturated KCl which followed neuro-physiology or cardiology experimental protocols performed by other investigators. For this study, analysis of the IEC was performed on all 22 cats, while analysis of the LPC was performed on nine cats (three juvenile and four adults).\n\nThe IELs and LPLs were isolated using methods described for other species with minor modi\u00aecations (Lundqvist et al., 1992; Santhi and Ramanadham, 1995; Kearsey and Stadnyk, 1996) . The small intestine, extending from the duodenum to the ileo-cecocolic junction was excised. Fecal material and excess mucus were removed from the intestinal lumen with extensive\u00afushing with RPMI 1640 medium pH 7.4 containing 2 mM dithiothreitol, 100 ml/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (all from Fisher Scienti\u00aec, Pittsburgh, PA). The intestine was opened longitudinally and cut into 2 cm fragments and the Peyer's patches were resected. The intestinal fragments were washed for 10 min with the solution described above prior to leukocyte extraction. Extraction of cells from the IEC consisted of incubation of washed intestinal fragments with stirring for an hour in Ca 2 Mg 2 free Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS, Fisher Scienti\u00aec), containing 5 mM EDTA, 10% FetalClone I serum (Hyclone Inc., Oregon, UT) and 10 mM HEPES. Cell suspensions were collected after centrifugation of the supernatant at 200\u00c2g for 5 min. This procedure was repeated twice for maximum leukocyte IEC yield. The intestinal segments were further washed with stirring for 1 h prior to extraction of leukocytes from the LPC. LPC leukocytes from nine animals were obtained after 6\u00b18 h incubation of the IEL-extracted intestinal fragments on an orbital shaker (Bellco Glass Inc, Vineland, NJ) at 10\u00c2g in RPMI 1640 pH 7.4 containing 0.01% collagenase type III (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Freehold, NJ), 10% FetalClone I serum, 10 mM HEPES. Collagenase type III was used for extraction of LPLs because of its low proteolytic activity and reduced likelihood of enzymatic degradation of cell surface antigens. The collagenase recognition sequence (PXGP) is rare in proteins other than collagen and is not present in the feline lymphocyte molecules for which sequences are known (CD4, CD8a and CD8b). The collagenase digested material was pressed through a stainless steel wire mesh (Fisher Scienti\u00aec) to free the LPC leukocytes. The IEC and LPC leukocyte suspensions were \u00aeltered four times through columns packed with glass wool (Fisher Scienti\u00aec). Following extraction and \u00aeltration, IEC and LPC leukocytes were washed with RPMI 1640 and resuspended in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4 (PBS) with 10% v/v heat inactivated horse serum (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) and 0.01% sodium azide (buffer A) for cytospin preparations and\u00afow cytometry.\n\nMorphologic evaluation, differential cell counts and immunocytology were performed on cytocentrifuged preparations of isolated IEC (n22) and LPC (n9). Approximately 5000 cells per slide were resuspended in 100 ml of buffer A and centrifuged at 200\u00c2g for 5 min in a cytocentrifuge (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). Cytospins were air dried and stained with undiluted May-Gru \u00c8nwald for 8 min and Giemsa (both from VWR Scienti\u00aec Products, San Francisco, CA), diluted 1:40 for 45 min or were \u00aexed in acetone and stored at \u00c0708C for immunocytology.\n\nA panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including feline speci\u00aec and cross-reactive canine and human speci\u00aec reagents, were used for\u00afow cyometry and immunohistology (Table 1) . CD79a, CD14 and CD3e are raised to human speci\u00aec antigens. CD11b, CD11d and CD18 are raised to canine speci\u00aec antigens. Reagents that recognize CD4, CD8a, CD8b, CD21, CD22, CD49d and MHC class II are feline speci\u00aec. All mAbs assessed cell surface molecule expression with the exception of CD3-12 and HM57, which were generated against synthetic peptides corresponding to conserved intra-cytoplasmic sequences of CD3e and CD79a, respectively (Jones et al., 1993) . CD3-12 was generated against the human CD3e cytoplasmic peptide sequence which was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) as follows: NH 2 -ERPPPVPNPDYEP-OH. This reagent is cross-reactive to the cat because of the high degree of homology between the feline and human CD3e amino acid sequence in this region (Woo and Moore, unpublished data) .\n\nHuman CD3e ERPPPVPNPDYEP Feline CD3e EKPPPVPNPDYEP The speci\u00aecity of CD8a and CD8b mAbs for each CD8 chain was con\u00aermed by screening each mAb against the appropriately transfected feline recombinant CD8 constructs (Pecoraro et al., 1994; Pecoraro et al., 1996) (M. Shimojima, personal communication). The putative CD49d reagent is designated CD49d-like based on immunoprecipitation data and appropriate cell and tissue distribution (Woo and Moore, unpublished data).\n\nFor double label\u00afow cytometry experiments, a combination of biotin (aminohexanoyl-biotin N-hydroxysuccinimide, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), R-Phycoerythrin (R-PE, Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) or Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, Molecular Probes Inc.) conjugated IgG mAbs were used. This included anti-CD4-biotin, anti-CD8a-R-PE, anti-CD11d-R-PE, anti-CD4-FITC, anti-CD8a-FITC, and anti-CD3e-FITC.\n\nFor single label experiments, cells were resuspended in buffer A at a concentration of 2\u00c210 7 cells per ml. Approximately, 1\u00c210 6 cells were labeled with 25 ml of undiluted tissue culture supernatant (TCF) followed by FITC labeled horse anti-mouse IgG or antirat IgG (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as described previously (Danilenko et al., 1992 ). An irrelevant mouse myeloma IgG1 hybridoma supernatant served as a negative control. For double label experiments, similar cell suspensions were incubated with titered amounts of directly conjugated mAbs as above. Biotin conjugated mAbs were detected using either neutralite-avidin-R-PE or neutralite-avidin-FITC (both from Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL). Assessment of intracytoplasmic CD3e was achieved using anti-CD3e-FITC in conjunction with cell surface permeabilization using the Fix & Perm Cell Permeabilization Kit (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) as per manufacturer's instructions. Negative controls in both double label and permeabilization experiments consisted of resuspended cells stained with either no antibody or with an irrelevant unconjugated, R-PE or FITC-conjugated mouse IgG. All labeled cell suspensions were analyzed with a FACScan analytical cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) equipped with Cell Quest software (Becton Dickinson). Phenotypic analysis with single mAb labeling was performed on 22 cats for IELs, and nine cats for LPLs. Phenotypic analysis with double mAb labeling on IELs were performed on 12 of 22 cats.\n\nTissue sampling of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum was also performed prior to IEL and LPL isolation techniques from four of nine juvenile and six of 13 adult cats. Tissues between 3 and 5 mm width were snap-frozen in OCT compound (Finetek Sakura USA, Torrance, CA) by immersion in 2-methylbutane (Fisher Scienti\u00aec) cooled to freezing point in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissue sections of 5 mm thickness and cytospin preparations from the IEC and LPC were stained by the avidin-biotin peroxidase method as previously described . Antibodies (Table 1 ) were applied to sections as tissue culture supernatants at a 1:10 dilution. An irrelevant isotype matched antibody or omission of the primary antibody was used as a negative control. Positive controls were performed using frozen sections of normal feline spleen. Additional blocking of non-speci\u00aec sites was performed on cryosections of the intestine using an additional avidin-biotin blocking step (Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit, Vector Laboratories) as per manufacturer's recommendations. Antibody staining was detected using the chromagen, 3-amino-9-ethyl-carbazole (AEC, Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Tissue sections and cytospin preparations were subsequently counterstained in Gill's hematoxylin (Fisher Scienti\u00aec).\n\nValues are given as percentage meanAES.D. and range (minimum\u00b1maximum). Statistical analysis of independent samples was done with the Kruskal\u00b1Wallis test (non parametric analysis of variance). Signi\u00aecant differences between groups were declared where p values less than 0.05 were present.\n\nConsistent yields of leukocytes from the IEC were obtained from all samples from both juvenile and adult cats. Cytologic examination con\u00aermed that both the IEC and LPC fractions had good purity with few epithelial cells in the IEC pool and minimal contamination of granular IELs in the LPC pool. Differential cell counts, performed on May\u00b1Gru \u00c8nwald Giemsa stained cytospin preparations, demonstrated that the IEC suspensions contained a majority of lymphocytes. However, signi\u00aecant differences in yield and lymphocyte morphology were observed between the two age groups. The cell yields from both the IEC and LPC were signi\u00aecantly reduced (p<0.05) in juvenile cats compared with adults (Table 2) . Also, leukocytes from the IEC in juvenile cats had a signi\u00aecantly increased (p<0.05) subpopulation of granular lymphocytes compared with adults. These granular intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IELs), named for their morpholo-gically distinct intracytoplasmic azurophilic granules, were variable in size but rarely exceeded 12 mm in diameter. Their distinctive cytoplasmic granules also varied in number, size and shape and were either grouped in close proximity to the nucleus or diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm. With the exception of granular lymphocytes, similar percentages of leukocytes were present in the IEC of both juvenile and adult cats ( Table 2) . Globular leukocytes were the second major component of this compartment. These cells were approximately 15\u00b120 mm in diameter, had oval nuclei with diffuse chromatin and contained large round intracytoplasmic granules. Differential cell counts on leukocytes from the LPC were not performed as elevated numbers of lysed cells were observed on cytospin preparations. However, LPC leukocytes were composed of a majority of small lymphocytes and few plasma cells. As in the IEC, mast cells, monocytes, macrophages and few polymorphonuclear cells were minor components which were also present in this compartment (Table 2) .\n\nDespite a signi\u00aecant difference in cell yield and lymphocyte morphology between juvenile and adult cats, signi\u00aecant differences in antigen expression by lymphocyte subpopulations in both the IEL and LPL were not observed between juvenile and adult cats. Phenotypic results, therefore, re\u00afect the \u00aendings of the combined juvenile and adult groups. Isolated IELs were examined for expression of T cell antigens including CD3, CD4, CD5 and CD8 (alpha and beta chains) ( Table 3) . Quantitation of expression, distribution within the intra-epithelial compartment and cytologic features of IELs were investigated using\u00afow cytometry, immunohistology and cytology. The majority of IELs, including both granular and non-granular lymphocytes, expressed CD3. Fewer IELs expressed CD5. Both CD8a and CD8b lymphocytes consistently predominated in number over CD4 T cells such that the ratio of CD4:CD8a lymphocytes was 0.25. Although increased numbers of CD8lymphocytes were present in the IEL pool, a discrepancy in expression of CD8a and CD8b was observed. As many as 40% of CD8a IELs did not express the CD8b chain and were interpreted as CD8aa IELs. Dual staining of IELs with CD3/CD8a and CD3/CD4 by\u00afow cytometry detected very few CD3\u00c0/ CD8a and extremely rare CD3\u00c0/CD4 lymphocytes. Dual staining of IELs with CD4/ CD8 by\u00afow cytometry demonstrated a substantial population of CD4\u00c0/CD8\u00c0 (DN) lymphocytes (44%) was present, while CD4/CD8 (DP) lymphocytes (2%) were rare.\n\nIsolated LPLs were also examined for antigen expression using the same panel of T cell mAbs (Table 3) . CD3e expression was investigated only by immunohistology and immunocytology since permeabilization caused major lysis of LPC leukocytes. However, expression of CD5, CD4, CD8a and CD8b antigens was investigated with both\u00afow cytometry and immunohistology. As in the IEL population, the majority of LPLs were CD3 T cells with fewer cells expressing CD5. However, CD4 and CD8a expression differed from the IEL population. LPLs were represented by a three-fold increase in CD4 T cells and a three-fold decrease in CD8 T cells, both of which were signi\u00aecant changes (p<0.05) compared with the IEL population. This variation in percentages of CD4 and CD8a lymphocytes resulted in a LPL CD4:CD8a ratio of 1.0, which was increased over that observed in the IEL pool. In contrast to the increased expression of CD8a over CD8b antigens as observed in the IEL pool, CD8 cells in the LPL pool were composed of similar percentages of CD8a and CD8b cells. This equivalent level of CD8a and CD8b expression was more consistent with the majority of CD8 lymphocytes in the LPL compartment expressing CD8ab heterodimers, and fewer CD8 lymphocytes expressing CD8aa homodimers.\n\nFew B cells (CD21 and CD22) were detected in both the IEC and LPC. Fewer than 1% B cells in each compartment were detected by\u00afow cytometry. In concordance with this, B cells were not observed by immunohistology in the IEC. However, occasional CD79a B cells were observed in the LPC by immunohistology and largely appeared as plasma cells in the deep portion of intestinal glands.\n\nIntestinal lymphocytes were also assessed for expression of CD18, CD11b, CD11d and CD49d. A large percentage of IELs expressed CD18 (Table 3) . However, antigen expression as determined by\u00afow cytometry, occurred as a continuum which ranged from low to high density of expression. This variable expression was also observed by immunohistology where variation in intensity of staining occurred. A majority of LPLs also expressed CD18. In addition, immunohistology demonstrated CD18 expression on macrophages, neutrophils and antigen presenting cells. With the exception of rare neutrophils and macrophages in the LPC, CD11b was not expressed by IELs or LPLs. CD11d, the fourth a chain of the b2 integrin family, was expressed by a small subpopulation of IELs (Table 3) . Dual label staining demonstrated that CD11d cells largely co-expressed CD3. However, although 40% of CD11d cells co-expressed CD8a and 15% of CD11d cells co-expressed CD4, as many as 45% of CD11d cells proved to be negative for both CD4 and CD8 antigens ( Table 3) . Evaluation of CD49d expression on IELs and LPLs demonstrated that a majority of IELs (75%) and fewer LPLs (67%) expressed this antigen, similar to that observed for CD18.\n\nMHC class II expression on both IELs and LPLs was the most variable parameter analyzed by\u00afow cytometry (Table 3) . Antigen expression in the IEL population was either low or had a continuous distribution such that a broad range of expression from 3 to 74% was observed. Although the lamina propria contained increased numbers of MHC class II lymphocytes, a similarly broad range of expression from 5 to 77% was also detected. Immunohistology demonstrated marked variation in staining on IELs and LPLs con\u00aerming this variation in density of cell surface expression. Intestinal epithelial cells did not express MHC class II.\n\nThe study of diffuse MALT has been hampered by the dif\u00aeculty of accessing intraepithelial (IEC) and lamina proprial (LPC) leukocyte populations in suf\u00aecient purity and yield to allow meaningful studies. In this study, adaptation of existing methods originally developed for the study of diffuse MALT in humans and rodents, resulted in consistent cell yield and purity from feline intestine. Feline IELs were enriched for granular lymphocytes, this was especially so in juvenile cats. The majority of feline IEL were T cells, which consistently expressed CD3, but exhibited reduced frequency of expression of CD5. Feline IEL predominantly expressed CD8a and less frequently CD8b, but a large population of lymphocytes, which lacked expression of CD4 or CD8, was also prevalent. In contrast, feline IEL, which co-expressed CD4 and CD8 were rare. In these respects feline IEL differed markedly from IEL of rodents (Vaage et al., 1990; Fangmann et al., 1991; Lefrancois, 1991; Maloy et al., 1991; Takimoto et al., 1992; Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993; Santhi and Ramanadham, 1995; Kearsey and Stadnyk, 1996; Helgeland et al., 1997) and humans (Spencer et al., 1989; Jarry et al., 1990; Guy-Grand and Vassalli, 1993; Machado et al., 1994; Lundqvist et al., 1995) . Unexpectedly, feline IEL exhibited broad variation in MHC class II expression between individuals, in contrast to the consistent high frequency of MHC class II expression by peripheral blood lymphocytes of all lineages in cats. Also, the expression of CD11d by a minor subset of feline IEL appeared to be a unique feature. Feline LPLs were more dif\u00aecult to assess due to poor viability following prolonged incubation necessary for their release. Feline LPL populations were broadly similar to IEL populations with the exception of higher frequency of CD4 expression by T cells and lower frequency of CD8a expression. In contrast to IEL, granular lymphocytes were infrequently encountered, and CD11d expression was minimal in the LPL population.\n\nAssessment of differential cell counts and cytology, in conjunction with quantitation b\u0233 ow cytometry, demonstrated that the isolation techniques used in this study provided representative populations of leukocytes from the IEC and LPC of the feline small intestine. Immunostaining of tissue sections and cytocentrifuge preparations qualitatively validated the lymphocyte phenotypes on IELs and LPLs that were established by quantitative\u00afow cytometry. Although consistent leukocyte yields were obtained in both juvenile and adult cats, juvenile cats had signi\u00aecantly reduced IEC yields compared with adults. However, despite this reduced cell yield in juvenile cats, differential cell counts demonstrated that granular lymphocytes represented a signi\u00aecantly increased percentage of cells in the IEC. Although this has been observed in other species, the reasons or mechanisms by which this age-associated variation in yield and lymphocyte morphology occurs are not well understood. Aging has been associated with elevation in IEL numbers in man (Machado et al., 1994) and mouse (Maloy et al., 1991) and is hypothesized to be driven by continuous antigen stimulation. This increased cell yield which was consistently detected in adult cats suggests that a similar situation occurs in this species. The variation in lymphocyte morphology is also reported in other species. Granular IELs are reported in the rat where they represent a signi\u00aecant percentage of the CD3 IEL population (Vaage et al., 1990) . However, despite this observation, the function and signi\u00aecance of granular lymphocytes remains unknown.\n\nAlthough the majority of feline IELs expressed CD3, only 50% of IELs expressed CD5. This contrasts with CD5 expression on peripheral T lymphocytes in peripheral blood and tissues and the thymus where CD5 is expressed by virtually all peripheral T cells and mature thymocytes ( Van de Velde et al., 1991) . A similar reduction in the expression of CD5 on IEL subsets have been described in mouse (Lefrancois, 1991; Mosley et al., 1994) , rat (Fangmann et al., 1991; Takimoto et al., 1992) and man (Jarry et al., 1990) . Although, the functional signi\u00aecance of CD5\u00c0 T cells is not well understood, it is hypothesized that the lack of CD5 may derive from the absence of interaction between T and B cells in the intestinal epithelium (Van de Velde et al., 1991) .\n\nMarked differences in CD4 and CD8 expression were observed in the phenotypic comparison between the IEL and LPL populations. Few feline IELs expressed CD4 compared with the LPL population where a signi\u00aecant increase in CD4 LPLs was observed. Conversely, CD8a lymphocytes constituted a major subpopulation of feline IELs but were a reduced component of the feline LPL pool. This variation in CD4 and CD8 expression was assessed by examination of the CD4:CD8 ratio in each compartment. Increased percentages of CD8a lymphocytes (40%) and low percentages of CD4 lymphocytes (10%) resulted in an IEL CD4:CD8a ratio of 0.25. This contrasted with the LPL CD4:CD8a ratio of 1.0 associated with increased percentages of CD4 lymphocytes (27%) and reduced percentages of CD8a lymphocytes (28%). However, despite the increase in CD4 LPLs in the feline intestine, the CD4:CD8 ratio in this compartment remained low compared with peripheral T cells in which a CD4:CD8 ratio of 2.5 is routinely observed in speci\u00aec pathogen free juvenile cats (Woo et al., 1997) . Similar \u00aendings are reported in the mouse (Lefrancois, 1991; Camerini et al., 1993; and man (Lundqvist et al., 1995) where CD4 cells represent a markedly reduced subpopulation of IELs, and an increased subpopulation of LPLs in contrast with CD8 intestinal lymphocytes.\n\nAlthough CD8 lymphocytes constituted a major subpopulation of feline IELs, a marked discrepancy between CD8a and CD8b chain expression was observed. This discrepancy implied that a signi\u00aecant percentage of CD8 IELs expressed CD8ab homodimers, rather than CD8ab heterodimers. This contrasts with the predominance of CD8ab lymphocytes observed in other peripheral lymphoid tissues, peripheral blood and thymus. This discrepancy between CD8a and CD8b chain expression was not observed in the feline LPL population where both CD8a and CD8b chains were expressed in similar percentages, more consistent with conventional CD8ab chain expression. The predominance of expression of CD8aa chains by feline CD8IELs is similar to that described in mouse (Lefrancois, 1991) , rat (Kuhnlein et al., 1994; Helgeland et al., 1997) and man (Jarry et al., 1990; Latthe et al., 1994) where they represent a substantial subpopulation of CD8 IELs. However, despite the predominance of the CD8aa phenotype in the IEL population, the biology and speci\u00aec functions of CD8aa IELs are not well understood.\n\nThis unusual phenotype has prompted the proposal that these cells are derived from extrathymic developmental pathways (Neuhaus et al., 1995; Taplin et al., 1996; Hamad et al., 1997) and their predominance in the intra-epithelial mucosa suggests that they perform a unique function in immune surveillance of the mucosal barrier. The localization of CD8aa lymphocytes in intraepithelial sites has also suggested that both the intestinal environment and epithelium play a critical role in expression of this phenotype . As a means of de\u00aening possible functions of CD8aa IELs in immune surveillance, further investigations have focused on T cell receptor (TCR) expression and TCR-Vb repertoire of this subpopulation. However, signi\u00aecant differences between CD8aa and CD8ab IELs have not been described. Similarities between CD8aa and CD8ab IELs include preferential co-expression of TCRab, (Latthe et al., 1994; Regnault et al., 1994; Neuhaus et al., 1995; Regnault et al., 1996; Sydora et al., 1996; Taplin et al., 1996) and minimal differences in TCR-Vb repertoire (Regnault et al., 1996) . Other indicators of function, including cytotoxic activity (Mosley et al., 1994) and cytokine response and production (Taguchi et al., 1991) , have also not been found to differ between murine CD8aa/TCRab and CD8ab/TCRab IELs.\n\nA major fraction of feline IELs lacked expression of CD4 and CD8. This double negative (DN) subpopulation accounted for greater than 40% of the IEL pool. While this phenotype is unusual compared with lymphocytes described in peripheral blood and tissues, DN lymphocytes are consistently reported as a subpopulation of IELs. However, in contrast to our \u00aendings in the cat, DN lymphocytes represent minor IEL subpopulations accounting for less than 10% of IELs in both rat (Taguchi et al., 1991) and man (Spencer et al., 1989) . This percentage of DN cells in this feline study may be exaggerated by the inclusion of natural killer (NK) cells or TCRgd T cells which would not be expected to express either CD4 or CD8 antigens. More precise phenotypic analysis to determine TCR expression or the presence of NK cells within this DN population was not performed due to the lack of feline speci\u00aec reagents. Also, CD3 expression on this DN subpopulation which would be expected on TCRgd IELs was not directly determined. While murine studies demonstrate CD3 expression on intestinal TCRgd T lymphocytes (Camerini et al., 1993; Kuhnlein et al., 1994) , they are mostly negative for CD4 and CD8. By analogy, feline intestinal TCRgd T lymphocytes are also be expected to be negative for CD4 and CD8. Converse to the \u00aendings with DN IELs, only a minor fraction of feline IELs co-expressed CD4 and CD8. This dual positive (DP) fraction accounted for only 2% of IELs which is, therefore, similar to the percentage of DP lymphocytes observed in peripheral blood. Again, this contrasts with reports in other species where DP lymphocytes represent much larger subpopulations of the IEL pool. This may range from 20 to 35% of IELs in rat (Fangmann et al., 1991; Kearsey and Stadnyk, 1996) and 4\u00b130% of IELs in mouse (Lefrancois, 1991; Taguchi et al., 1991; .\n\nInvestigation of b2 integrin expression by feline IELs demonstrated that a majority of lymphocytes expressed the beta subunit, CD18. Investigation of expression of the alpha subunits was restricted to CD11b and CD11d as feline speci\u00aec reagents that recognize CD11a and CD11c are not available. A minor subpopulation of feline IELs expressed CD11d. The CD11d molecule is the most recently described alpha chain of the leukointegrin family, and its distribution has been examined most extensively in the dog (Danilenko et al., 1995) . Canine CD11d is expressed by a minor subset of both splenic and peripheral blood lymphocytes, and there is no evidence of CD11d expression by intestinal lymphocytes by immunohistology. However, in humans, CD11d expression appears more diffuse and has been observed on mononuclear cells of the mucosa as well as deeper layers of the intestine (Bernstein et al., 1996) . As CD11d expression in the cat is largely similar in its tissue distribution to that described for dogs (Danilenko et al., 1995) , the \u00aending of CD11d feline IELs was unexpected. Despite the presence of CD11d lymphocytes in this unexpected location in the cat, many phenotypic similarities were noted between the feline IEL and canine splenic and peripheral blood CD11d lymphocytes. This includes the expression of CD3 by the majority of cells, the presence of a large percentage of DN cells, and the predominance of CD8 expression over CD4 as a component of this subpopulation. Also of note, were the presence of intracytoplasmic granules in 35% of canine splenic CD11d lymphocytes. As a signi\u00aecant population of feline IELs also exhibited granular morphology, it is likely that a subpopulation of granular IELs also express CD11d.\n\nThis preliminary morphologic and phenotypic investigation of the feline diffuse MALT demonstrates marked similarities with the murine, rat and human diffuse mucosal lymphoid tissue. As in these species, feline IELs were mostly CD3 T cells with reduced expression of CD5 and a predominance of CD8a expression over CD4. However, while T cell antigen expression was principally analogous to other species, quantitative differences were noted in the cat. This included increased numbers of DN lymphocytes, reduced numbers of DP lymphocytes and the presence of a minor subpopulation of CD11d IELs. As described for other species, the feline LPL population differed phenotypically from IELs. These differences included the reduced expression of CD8a and increased expression of CD4 and CD8b. However, further phenotypic investigation is clearly needed to better characterize mucosal T cell populations. In particular, investigation of TCR expression by both IEL and LPL subpopulations, expression of aEb7 and a4b7 integrins associated with mucosal lymphocyte traf\u00aecking, and expression of markers of T cell activation are necessary to better understand the phenotypic basis of normal intestinal mucosal immune function in the cat. This would greatly enhance our ongoing investigations of perturbations, in the intestinal mucosal immune system, which are likely to accompany feline in\u00afammatory bowel disease, feline intestinal lymphoma, and feline immunode\u00aeciency virus infection."}
