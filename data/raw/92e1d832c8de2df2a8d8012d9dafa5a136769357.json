{"title": "", "body": "Jaundice results when serum bilirubin is increased above 2 mg/ml. Most bilirubin originates from senescent erythrocytes and is processed in the liver for excretion in the bile.\n\nJaundice results from either increased erythrocyte hemolysis, which exceeds the processing capacity of the liver, or hepatobiliary disease.\n\nPre-hepatic jaundice is due to hemolytic processes. Erythrocyte hemolysis causes release of increased heme pigments, which overwhelm hepatic processing/excretion of bilirubin.\n\nHepatic jaundice is seen with severe diffuse hepatic cholestasis (via inflammation) or major bile duct obstruction. Inflammation in portal or periportal areas causes jaundice early in the disease course; whereas, parenchymal injury away from periportal areas results in jaundice development late in the disease course.\n\nPost-hepatic jaundice is caused by intraluminal or extraluminal disorders that mechanically occlude the biliary tree (e.g., gall bladder and common bile duct).\n\nPost-hepatic (extrahepatic biliary obstruction).\n\nPre-hepatic causes for jaundice are primarily attributable to erythrocyte parasitemia (hemobartellosis), infectious disease (FeLV), and immune-mediated hemolysis (rare).\n\nHepatic causes for jaundice may be caused by hepatic lipidosis, cholangiohepatitis syndrome and hepatic lymphosarcoma.\n\nPost-hepatic causes for jaundice are caused by pancreatitis and neoplasms involving the gallbladder and biliary tree (less common).\n\nNon-jaundiced cats with elevated liver enzymes may or may not have significant hepatic disease. An underlying defect in bilirubin metabolism affecting conjugation reactions or cytosolic pigment transport or storage is suspected. This phenomena is observed with a variety of non-hepatic primary disorders (e.g., renal and gastrointestinal diseases) which may cause these cats to later develop primary liver disease. Bile acid analysis determines hepatic function and the need to obtain cytologic/biopsy specimens for definitive diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 Pale mucus membranes, PCV usually < 18%; hemoglobin < 10 g/dl. \u2022 Lethargy, in appetence, and anorexia may be observed. \u2022 +/fever. \u2022 Occasional vomiting.\n\nSee main reference on page 530 for details (The Anemic Cat).\n\nRapid destruction of red cells exceeds the liver's capacity to metabolize increased hemoglobin breakdown products (bilirubin).\n\nMost commonly associated with Mycoplasma haemofelis infection and less commonly with immune-mediated anemia. Hemolysis may also be caused by feline leukemia viral (FeLV) infection. +/\u2212 fever and vomiting.\n\nLymphadenopathy, or skin, respiratory, and gastrointestinal infections secondary to immunosuppression are seen with FeLV infection.\n\nTypically anemia is moderate to severe (PCV 12-17%) with a reduced hemoglobin < 10 g/dl.\n\nExamine blood smears closely with a reduced PCV for presence of red cell parasites (hemobartonellosis).\n\nSaline agglutination and direct Coomb's tests confirm immune-mediated anemia but the Coomb's test requires feline specific antibody to be meaningful.\n\nLiver enzymes (ALT, ALP) are often normal or insignificantly elevated. Serologic testing (ELISA or fluorescent antibody) for FeLV infection.\n\nPolymerase chain reaction assays may be of great benefit in documenting infection if available.\n\nHepatic and post-hepatic disorders are often chronic diseases and are associated with some anemia. In these instances, the anemia is mild (PCV of 18-27%), nonregenerative and is attributable to anemia of chronic disease.\n\nHemolytic anemia is usually regenerative unless it is detected early (< 4 days) or if stem cells are involved; as may occur with Mycoplasma haemofelis infection or immune-mediated red cell destruction.\n\nHemolytic anemia associated with FeLV infection may or may not be regenerative.\n\nSupportive care and antibiotics (doxycycline 5 mg/kg PO q 12 h for 21 days or enrofloxacin 5 mg/kg PO q 12 h for 7-14 days) for cats with hemobartonellosis.\n\nWhole blood/packed red cell transfusions, corticosteroids (prednisone 1-2 mg/kg PO q 12 h as needed), and supportive care for immune-mediated anemia. Clinical parameters which suggest the need for transfu-sion include increased heart and respiratory rates which usually occur when the PCV < 15-18% for acute loss and < 12% for more chronic loss. See page 531 (The Anemic Cat).\n\nHEPATIC LIPIDOSIS*** Classical signs \u2022 Obese anorectic female cats are predisposed. \u2022 Progressive anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea are common. \u2022 Severe jaundice and hepatomegaly are present.\n\nThe etiopathogenesis is poorly understood and illdefined.\n\nTriglycerides accumulate in the liver as a consequence of imbalanced fat metabolism which is likely multifactorial in origin. These imbalances may include uptake of fatty acids, use of fatty acids for energy (e.g., ketone production and fatty acid oxidation), production and dispersal of lipoproteins throughout the body, and de novo synthesis of triglycerides. Many metabolic conditions, nutritional factors, drugs and toxins can cause excessive hepatic fat accumulation (see below). Approximately 50% of cats have idiopathic (primary) hepatic lipidosis in which no underlying medical condition is detected.\n\n\u2022 History of previous obesity is observed in nearly all cats. \u2022 Anorexia or rapid weight reduction contributes to hepatic fat accumulation. Anorexia may be preceded by a stressful event such as a move to a new house. \u2022 Imbalanced nutrition using caloric-or proteinrestricted diets, especially if unpalatable, can trigger marked weight loss. Experimentally, dietary energy must be restricted 50-75% for at least 2 weeks to induce hepatic lipidosis. \u2022 Hepatic lipidosis occurs either as a primary idiopathic event or secondary to another disease process. Frequently it occurs secondary to underlying diseases, most commonly cholangiohepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and acute or chronic pancreatitis. A recent study for 30% of cats had acute pancreatitis. \u2022 Acquired carnitine deficiency may be related to the development of hepatic lipidosis. Carnitine is primarily synthesized in the liver and is essential for enzyme-mediated uptake of fatty acids into mitochondria. In health, it also facilitates fatty acid product transport and the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. Starved cats have diminished capacity for fatty acid beta-oxidation or export of VLDL, leading to hepatic triglyceride sequestration. \u2022 Less commonly observed in association with diabetes mellitus and toxicity (e.g., aflatoxins, bacterial toxins).\n\nFat accumulation in hepatocytes results in cholestasis and hepatic jaundice.\n\nProgressive liver dysfunction causes anorexia, vomiting and dehydration.\n\nSigns of overt hepatic encephalopathy (ptyalism, seizures) are uncommon.\n\nMost commonly seen in middle-aged to older cats of either sex. There is no breed predisposition.\n\nThe most common early signs are progressive anorexia and depression with intermittent vomiting over several weeks.\n\nCommon presenting complaints include, weight loss, prolonged (> 2 weeks) anorexia, vomiting and lethargy.\n\nJaundice, hepatomegaly and dehydration are detected on physical examination.\n\nAscites, fever and ptyalism are uncommon.\n\nCytologic examination of hepatic parenchyma obtained via fine-needle aspirate, or histologic examination of a liver biopsy specimen is usually diagnostic for hepatic lipidosis. Histologic confirmation is the preferred modality, as recent reports have noted poor correlation between cytologic interpretation and histologic findings in cats with liver disease.\n\nHistopathologic confirmation requires specialized processing to assess.\n\n\u2022 Both hematoxylin/eosin and specific staining for fat should be performed. \u2022 Greater than 50% of hepatocytes contain lipid vacuolation.\n\nAbdominal ultrasonography may suggest hepatic lipidosis versus extrahepatic biliary obstruction, cholangiohepatitis and neoplasia.\n\n\u2022 Cats with hepatic lipidosis have diffuse hyperechogenicity, hepatomegaly, and an absence of biliary tract abnormalities.\n\nNon-regenerative anemia is seen in 30% of cats.\n\nBiochemical liver parameters are often suggestive of hepatic lipidosis.\n\n\u2022 Marked but discrepant increases of serum ALP in comparison to ALT and AST. \u2022 Total bilirubin values exceed 2 mg/dl as most cats are severely jaundiced.\n\nApproximately 30% of cats are hypokalemic.\n\nAbnormal coagulation tests are observed in > 50% of cats. Approximately 20% have clinical evidence of excessive bleeding. Vitamin K deficiency is the most common coagulation abnormality.\n\n\u2022 Carefully appraise coagulation status prior to liver aspirate or biopsy.\n\nCats with inflammatory liver disease (cholangiohepatitis) are often febrile and may have ascites. Increased ALT +/\u2212 AST and hyperglobulinemia are prominent features in these cats and are not observed in cats with hepatic lipidosis.\n\nSonographic abnormalities to the biliary excretory pathway or hepatic parenchyma are evident in most cats with extrahepatic biliary obstruction and neoplasia, respectively.\n\nCats must be fed 65-90 kcal/kg/day until eating.\n\n\u2022 Gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube alimentation with high-energy commercial enteral diets is necessary if vomiting is frequent. \u2022 Esophagostomy tubes can be used when vomiting is not frequent, and may be simpler and safer to place than gastrostomy tubes. \u2022 Nasoesophageal tubes are indicated in cats too ill for a gastrostomy tube. \u2022 They are often used for short-term support until placement of gastrostomy tube. \u2022 Nasoesophageal and some esophageal tubes require liquified commercial diets (Iams Nutritional Recovery Formula, Clinicare, or Hill's A/d mixed with water). \u2022 It takes several days before the caloric requirements can be fed in 3-4 meals per day without inducing vomiting. Initially small volumes, e.g., 5 ml, should be fed every 2 hours, and the volume is increased while reducing the frequency over several days. Alternatively, feeding can begin with a constant rate infusion over 24 hours using a syringe infusion pump with the volume increased gradually until the daily caloric requirements are met. Cats can then be transitioned to bolus feeding four times daily. Tubes should be left in place until the cat is voluntarily eating its full caloric requirements for 2 weeks and has a stable and increasing weight.\n\nAvoid benzodiazipines as they are inadequate to stimulate appetite and may aggravate CNS signs.\n\nVomiting is controlled with metoclopramide (0.2-0.5 mg/kg q 8 h or using a constant rate infusion 1-2 mg/cat/24 h). Two periods of exercise totaling 45-60 min/day help reduce vomiting and high gastric residual volumes. This can be accomplished by letting the cat free in a consulting room, preferably with a window.\n\nCorrect dehydration and electrolyte imbalances with fluid therapy. \u2022 Monitor serum potassium and phosphorous and supplement with KCl and potassium dihydrophosphate as needed to combat hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia.\n\nUrsodeoxycholic acid (10-15 mg PO q 24 h) for intrahepatic cholestasis.\n\nVitamin K 1 is often given (3-5 mg per cat q 12 h initially) due to the frequency of coagulation disturbances.\n\nThiamine supplementation (100 mg of thiamine hydrochloride, q 12 h by oral, subcutaneous or IM routes) is generally advised.\n\nThe potential value of carnitine (1250 mg L-carnitine/cat q 24 h) and taurine (250-500 mg q 24 h) supplementation has not been critically assessed but is unlikely to be harmful.\n\nSurvival rates are up to 60% with aggressive therapy.\n\nEvaluate closely for concomitant diseases (pancreatitis) as they warrant a more guarded prognosis.\n\nIt is important to use sensible restriction diets for obese cats. Feed 60-75% of maintenance requirements (60 kcal/kg) to promote slow but steady weight loss. Food intake should be adjusted monthly for the individual cat to produce a weight loss of 1-2% per week.\n\n\u2022 A variety of commercial, nutritionally balanced but reduced caloric rations are available.\n\n\u2022 Anorexia, weight loss, and vomiting.\n\n\u2022 Jaundice, +/fever, +/ascites.\n\n\u2022 Often palpable hepatomegaly.\n\nCholangitis is the cause of jaundice in 30% of cats.\n\nEtiology is unknown but may involve causative factors such as bacterial infection. The different forms of cholangitis may represent different stages of the same disease process. One hypothesis suggests that the unique anatomic relationship in which the bile duct and major pancreatic duct form a short common duct entering the duodenum may predispose cats to inflammatory hepatic disease. This connection might favor the ascension of luminal bacteria or the entrance of pancreatic enzymes into the biliary tract. Supporting this theory is the observation that inflammatory disease of other alimentary organs, such as pancreatitis and inflammatory bowel disease, are associated with cholangitis.\n\nA new classification scheme by the World Small Animal Veterinary Association Liver Diseases and Pathology Standardisation Research Group recognizes three distinct forms of cholangitis in cats.\n\nIn the traditional classification scheme, cholangitis denoted inflammation of the biliary tree and cholangiohepatitis referred to inflammation around bile ducts and peribiliary hepatocytes.\n\nHowever, with the new classification scheme, the term cholangitis is used in preference to cholangiohepatitis, because inflammatory disruption of the limiting plate to involve hepatic parenchyma is not always a feature and, when present, is an extension of a primary cholangitis, and inflammation is centered on intrahepatic bile ducts.\n\nThree separate syndromes occur as defined by clinical and histologic criteria: neutrophilic cholangitis, lymphocytic cholangitis and chronic cholangitis.\n\nCirrhosis may occur as an end-stage of cholangitis but is rare.\n\n\u2022 The lymphocytic form is more common than the neutrophilic form of cholangitis in the UK and Australia, but the neutrophilic form appears to be the most common form in some other locations.\n\n\u2022 This is usually referable to ascending bacterial infection but is also rarely reported in protozoal infections. E. coli is sometimes cultured from the bile, and occasionally Gram-positive anaerobes are cultured. \u2022 Two phases of neutrophilic cholangitis are recognized; an acute phase and a chronic phase.\n\n\u2022 Neutrophils are within walls and lumina of intrahepatic bile ducts and within portal areas. Bile duct epithelial degeneration and necrosis is present. There is variable extension of inflammation through the limiting plate to involve periportal parenchyma. Bacteria may be visible. There is usually minimal biliary hyperplasia or periductal fibrosis. \u2022 Generally, there is an acute onset of signs with marked systemic illness (fever, anorexia, lethargy, vomiting).\n\n\u2022 Mild to severe infiltration of portal areas by plasma cells, lymphocytes and neutrophils, without or without macrophages is present. Leukocytes are within walls and/or lumina of bile ducts, and are associated with biliary epithelial degeneration or necrosis. Lymphoid aggregates may be present in portal areas. Biliary hyperplasia, periductal fibrosis or bridging portal fibrosis may be present. \u2022 It is usually associated with partial or complete biliary obstructive lesions resulting in cholestasis. \u2022 Signs and liver enzyme elevations tend to be milder than with the acute neutrophilic phase, and reflect a smoldering inflammatory hepatic disease. Weight loss is a dominant sign. Signs may wax and wane. Jaundice may or may not be present. Ascites is not a feature of the acute or chronic phase. In general, the chronic phase appears less common than the acute phase.\n\n\u2022 Lymphocytic cholangitis is postulated to be immune-mediated in origin. \u2022 Histologically there is moderate to marked infiltration of portal areas by small lymphocytes. With chronicity, the intensity of portal infiltration tends to abate. Lymphocytic infiltrates may also be present that are centered on and infiltrating walls of bile ducts, but this is an inconsistent feature, especially in the chronic phase. Inflammation may or may not extend into the periportal parenchyma. Histologic evidence of intrahepatic cholestasis may be present. \u2022 It occurs primarily in middle-aged cats with chronic (> 3 weeks) signs. Recurrent episodes of clinical signs are often interspersed with weeks or months of normalcy, with a normal or even increased appetite. \u2022 Cats are often less ill than with the acute neutrophilic form, and may have ascites. \n\nOften observed in middle-aged cats.\n\nIntermittent episodes of inappetance or anorexia and lethargy.\n\nWeight loss.\n\nFever occurs with neutrophilic cholangitis.\n\nAscites is sometimes observed with lymphocytic cholangitis. Ascitic fluid had a high total protein content attributable primarily to globulins.\n\nJaundice +/\u2212 hepatomegaly occur with both types.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis requires histologic evaluation of liver biopsy specimens.\n\n\u2022 Tissues may be obtained via ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy, laparoscopically or by laparotomy. However, 18-gauge needle biopsies are less reliable than wedge biopsies. In one study, less than 60% of cats with cholangitis had needle biopsy results that were in accordance with the diagnoses based on the wedge biopsy. \u2022 Perform coagulation tests (ACT or APTT/OSPT or PIVKA) prior to hepatic biopsy. Initiate vitamin K 1 therapy if abnormal (see dosage below).\n\nBile and liver culture are recommended in cats with suspected neutrophilic cholangitis.\n\nSurvey abdominal radiographs are usually normal but are useful to confirm hepatomegaly and the presence of peritoneal effusion. Abdominal sonography shows biliary tract thickening and distention (neutrophilic cholangitis) or increased parenchymal echogenicity (lymphocytic cholangitis).\n\nBiochemical liver parameters show high ALT, ALP and total bilirubin concentrations. Total bilirubin concentrations may increase 2-10 times normal values, with ALT concentration increased to a greater extent relative to ALP.\n\nIncreased plasma globulin and decreased albumin are often present in the lymphocytic form.\n\nLeukocytosis may be present in suppurative form.\n\nBiliary obstruction should be suspected in cats with lethargy, intermittent fever and progressive jaundice. These cats will require surgical correction for obstructive jaundice.\n\nCholangitis produces greater increases of serum ALT as compared to HL.\n\n\u2022 Cats with lymphocytic cholangitis may have concurrent inflammation involving pancreatic, intestinal and renal tissues.\n\nFever and ascites are common with cholangitis but are not observed with HL.\n\nCats with HL have higher ALP activity as compared to cholangitis-affected cats.\n\nFeline infectious peritonitis (FIP) may appear similar to the lymphocytic form, particularly if there is ascitic fluid with a high protein content. The syndromes clinically look similar, although fever is more common with FIP. Liver biopsy, especially a wedge section, is usually diagnostic.\n\nSpecific treatment is dictated by results of hepatic biopsy.\n\nNeutrophilic cholangitis.\n\n\u2022 Empiric antibiotic choices are amoxicillin (22 mg/kg PO q 12 h) and metronidazole (10 mg/kg PO q 12 h) or enrofloxacin (2.2 mg/kg bid PO) until bile culture results are known. \u2022 Continue antibiotic therapy for 6-8 weeks.\n\n\u2022 Ursodeoxycholic acid (10-15 mg/kg PO q 24 h) may be useful for choleresis following correction of biliary obstruction. \u2022 S-adenosylmethionine (20 mg/kg PO q 24 h) is recommended to replenish glutathione stores and scavenge free radicals. \u2022 Surgical correction (biliary diversion) is indicated in cats with clinical signs or imaging features (e.g., distended and tortuous common bile duct, large gall bladder and/or prominent intrahepatic bile ducts) indicative of obstructive biliary tract lesions.\n\nLymphocytic cholangitis.\n\n\u2022 Use immunosuppressive doses of steroids (prednisone 2 mg/kg PO q 24 h) for 4-6 weeks to reduce hepatic inflammation. If a favorable response is observed, then steroids may be tapered at 25% of the dose q 2 weeks as determined by clinical signs, liver enzymes and/or bile acid tests.\n\n\u2022 Administer ursodeoxycholic acid for choleresis and modulation of \"noxious\" bile acids. \u2022 Long-term immunosuppressive therapy (steroids +/\u2212 metronidazole) is often required in cats with persistent clinical signs or abnormal laboratory values. Some cats that fail to respond to prednisone may respond to chlorambucil (0.2 mg/kg PO q 48 h).\n\nSupportive care as dictated by the animal's needs.\n\n\u2022 Vitamin K 1 for coagulopathy (3-5 mg per cat PO q 24 hours as needed). \u2022 Fluid therapy to combat dehydration and electrolyte disturbances. \u2022 Nutritional therapy is important to reduce the hepatic workload and augment recovery.\n\n-Jejunostomy or gastrostomy tubes and feeding a pureed commercial or esophagostomy tubes and feeding a commercial liquified diet are best tolerated. -Feed a protein-modified diet as dictated by the status of renal function and signs of hepatic encephalopathy (rare). -Control vomiting with famotidine (0.2 mg/kg SID PO) or metoclopramide (0.2-0.5 mg/kg q 8 h) or constant rate infusion at 1-2 mg/cat/24 h.\n\nLong-term follow-up on a large number of cats with cholangitis has not been performed.\n\nThe prognosis with neutrophilic cholangitis is less favorable than for cats with lymphocytic cholangitis.\n\nCats with the neutrophilic form that survive the initial treatment period of several months have a reasonable chance for long-term survival.\n\nCats with lymphocytic cholangitis may survive comfortably for months to years with appropriate therapy.\n\nMedical/surgical correction of biliary obstructive lesions when recognized.\n\nTreatment of inflammatory (lymphocytic-plasmacytic) lesions involving the intestinal mucosa (i.e., inflammatory bowel disease).\n\n\u2022 50% of cats are < 2 years of age.\n\n\u2022 Weight loss, anorexia, vomiting and lethargy. \u2022 Jaundice +/cyclical fever.\n\n\u2022 Protein-rich ascites in \"effusive\" form.\n\nSee main reference, page 372 (The Pyrexic Cat).\n\nYoung cats (< 2 years old) and from a multicat environment are most susceptible.\n\nSigns are referable to chronic inflammation of the kidneys, liver, visceral lymph nodes, intestines, lungs, eyes and brain.\n\nChronic, progressive inappetance, weight loss, fever and depression.\n\nSigns may be cyclical at first. Jaundice and ascites may occur in cats with chronic liver involvement.\n\nDyspnea from pleural effusion occurs in about one in five cats.\n\nCNS signs include seizures, personality changes, nystagmus, head tremor and hyperesthesia.\n\nVomiting may occur with granuloma formation in the intestines, or inflammation in other organs such as the liver.\n\nOcular signs include bilateral uveitis, perivascular exudates, retinal hemorrhage or detachment.\n\nDiagnosis is based on history, clinical signs and characteristic histologic lesions on tissue biopsy. \u2022 Parenchymal lesions are characterized by multifocal hepatic necrosis with pyogranulomatous inflammation. \u2022 Pyogranulomas may be grossly evident on the capsule of the liver.\n\nIncreased activities of ALT and ALP are common.\n\nTotal bilirubin values may be increased above 2-3 mg/dl (jaundice).\n\nDiagnostic sampling of effusions is useful as they are generally high protein but low to moderate cellularity (modified transudate) with non-lytic neutrophils.\n\nSerologic testing for FIP antibodies may give confounding results. Coronaviral antibodies are widespread in the general cat population and the new 7B FIP antibody test appears to have problems with false negatives and false positives in the field.\n\n\u2022 Reverse transcriptase-PCR detection of coronaviral antigens in effusion fluid or tissues presently lacks high diagnostic accuracy. False positives occur because enteric coronavirus may be present systemically, and false-negative results also occur. \u2022 Immunocytochemistry demonstrating coronavirus antigen within circulating monocytes or tissue macrophages appears to be specific, but low numbers of infected cells in tissue samples limit the sensitivity for use in biopsy samples. The technique is only available at some laboratories.\n\nAbdominocentesis in FIP-infected cats may yield a protein-rich exudate which is dissimilar from other inflammatory/degenerative hepatopathies except lymphocytic cholangiohepatitis. Histopathology of the liver is diagnostic. Also, differentiate FIP from cardiomyopathy and neoplasia which may cause chronic illness similar to FIP or cavity effusion.\n\nCats with FIP will often have involvement of multiple organ systems (eyes, lungs, CNS).\n\nThere is no definitive therapy for FIP and the disease is almost uniformly fatal in cats with signs.\n\n\u2022 Supportive care is palliative at best.\n\n-Immunosuppressive doses of steroids (2-4 mg/kg PO q 24 h) +/\u2212 other cytotoxic drugs (e.g., cyclophosphamide 2.2 mg/kg/day on four consecutive days each week or chlorambucil 20 mg/m 2 every 2-3 weeks) are recommended for vasculitis. -Administer broad-spectrum antimicrobials for secondary bacterial infections.\n\n-Give human interferon-\u03b2 30 IU/day for 7 days at alternate weeks to boost immunity. -Nutritional support via force feedings, esophagostomy or gastrostomy tube, or nasoesophageal catheter. \u2022 Because of the extremely poor prognosis, euthanasia is recommended if there is no response to palliative therapy.\n\n\u2022 Most cats > 10 years of age.\n\n\u2022 Lethargy, anorexia, weight loss.\n\n\u2022 Jaundice may be present.\n\n\u2022 Hepatomegaly +/effusion (ascites or hemoperitoneum).\n\nGenerally presents as a manifestation of multicentric lymphosarcoma. Lesions may occur in conjunction with neoplastic infiltrates involving other lymphoid organs, such as peripheral lymph nodes, or the alimentary mucosa.\n\nNeoplastic lymphocytes gradually replace normal hepatocytes causing organ enlargement and hepatic failure.\n\n\u2022 Cholestasis and jaundice result from involvement of intrahepatic biliary structures.\n\nMostly seen in middle-aged and older cats.\n\nLethargy, anorexia, and weight loss predominate.\n\nHepatomegaly +/\u2212 jaundice are common.\n\nSuspicion of hepatic neoplasia is raised by older age, history of chronic illness and suggestive clinical signs.\n\nIncreased serum ALT and ALP activities are common.\n\nIn general, relatively greater increases in ALT versus ALP are observed.\n\nRadiographic imaging may aid diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 Symmetrical hepatomegaly is often observed on survey radiographs. \u2022 Hepatic sonography shows generalized hyperechogenicity or multifocal hypoechogenicity to the liver parenchyma.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis requires cytologic or histologic evaluation of liver specimens.\n\nRule out benign conditions, such as hepatic cysts, hepatocellular/bile duct adenomas, and regenerative nodules which may mimic hepatic lymphosarcoma. These other diseases may be definitively ruled out by performance of liver biopsy with histologic interpretation.\n\nCombination chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m 2 PO q 3 weeks), vincristine (0.75 mg/m 2 IV weekly for 4 weeks), and prednisone (2 mg/kg/day) is recommended. See page 676 for treatment details.\n\nProvide supportive therapy (including provision of enteral feeding if needed) as needed.\n\nThe prognosis is guarded. Approximately 50% of cats with hepatic lymphosarcoma will respond to multidrug chemotherapy.\n\nConcurrent FeLV infection shortens survival times but does not influence response to chemotherapy.\n\n\u2022 Anorexia, lethargy, neurologic signs and dyspnea. \u2022 Cyclical fever. \n\nInfection with the obligate intracellular coccidia causes inflammation and cell necrosis in affected tissues. Lung, brain, gut, liver and eye are most affected.\n\nDiverse but are generally referable to respiratory, neuromuscular or gastrointestinal systems.\n\nAnorexia, cyclical fever, dyspnea and lethargy are common.\n\nUveitis may involve one or both eyes.\n\nCystic involvement of the CNS may cause pronounced neurologic deficits (with the type of observed CNS deficit dependent upon involvement of the brain, brain stem and/or spinal cord), or may be rapidly fatal with advanced disease.\n\nCysts located within skeletal muscles are painful, and often cause hyperesthesia on muscle palpation, stiffness of gait and shifting leg lameness.\n\nHepatic involvement may follow dissemination causing jaundice due to hepatitis or cholangiohepatitis. Cystic involvement of the intestinal mucosa may cause lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis.\n\nNon-regenerative anemia and leukopenia.\n\nHyperproteinemia occurs in some cats with chronic toxoplasmosis.\n\nThoracic radiographs may demonstrate diffuse interstitial to alveolar opacities.\n\nSerologic testing provides useful diagnostic information. \u2022 IgM and IgG titers are assessed by ELISA techniques.\n\n-A high (> 256) IgM titer is suggestive of active infection. -A 4 \u00d7 rise in IgG titer over 2-3 weeks is suggestive of active infection.\n\nDemonstration of the organism (cysts) in affected biopsy/necropsy tissues is helpful in making a diagnosis.\n\nToxoplasmosis should be differentiated from other feline systemic infections including feline leukemia and immunodeficiency viral infections and feline infectious peritonitis.\n\nAvailable drugs suppress replication of T. gondii but do not completely kill the parasite.\n\n\u2022 Use clindamycin (12.5 mg/kg PO q 12 h) for 3 weeks. \u2022 Cats with ocular inflammation should be judiciously treated with topical glucocorticoids (topical 0.5 % prednisolone acetate drops q 6-12 h).\n\n\u2022 Often history of recent drug exposure.\n\n\u2022 Acute onset of cyanosis, dyspnea and facial edema. \u2022 +/jaundice occurs several days postingestion.\n\nCats have impaired ability to readily metabolize acetaminophen. Ingestion of 50-60 mg/kg may be fatal for cats. This is equivalent to one child tablet or half an adult tablet.\n\nLarge doses of acetaminophen produce toxic intermediates which cause oxidative damage in cells, especially erythrocytes and hepatocytes.\n\n\u2022 Oxidative damage to hemoglobin leads to methemoglobinemia and reduced oxygen-carrying capacity. \u2022 Tissue hypoxia and vascular injury occur.\n\nHepatic injury is characterized by hepatocellular necrosis.\n\nPale mucous membranes or acute cyanosis with bluetinged mucous membranes, dyspnea, facial edema, salivation and depression are typical signs of poisoning.\n\nIncreasing depression, weakness and panting occur. Increasing harsh lung sounds are secondary to worsening pulmonary edema.\n\nVomiting and generalized weakness are less common. Jaundice may occur 3-6 days post-ingestion.\n\nHemoglobinuria occurs in some cats or a dark brown urine containing increased amounts of hemoglobin, bilirubin and protein may be seen.\n\nDeath occurs within 18-36 hours of ingestion of a toxic dose.\n\nDiagnosis is based on a history of recent drug exposure and the presence of \"unique\" clinical signs.\n\nAnemia is typically non-regenerative within 4-6 days of intoxication. \u2022 Heinz-bodies may be visualized with new methylene blue stain. \u2022 Increased numbers of nucleated red cells reflecting hypoxemia may be evident.\n\nNeutrophilic leukocytosis reflects stress.\n\nUnexplained and rapid increase in liver biochemical parameters are observed.\n\n\u2022 ALT, AST, ALP and total bilirubin concentrations may be elevated.\n\nHistologic examination of hepatic biopsy specimens reveals hepatocellular necrosis, lipid accumulation and/or biliary duct proliferation.\n\nThe features of acetaminophen toxicosis (drug exposure classic signs, clinico-pathologic findings and acute hepatic injury) make most other diseases unlikely.\n\nAttempt to minimize drug absorption in acute (< 4 hours) intoxications.\n\n\u2022 Perform orogastric lavages (several cycles each at 5-10 ml/kg of tepid water) to mechanically remove gastric contents. \u2022 Give activated charcoal (2 g/kg body weight) to bind residual luminal toxicants via orogastric tube.\n\nFluid therapy may be required to correct dehydration, acid-base imbalances and electrolyte abnormalities occurring from vomiting.\n\n\u2022 N-acetylcysteine (Mucomyst, Mead Johnson & Co.) helps to neutralize toxic intermediates.\n\n-Administer a loading dose of 140 mg/kg orally, followed by doses of 70 mg/kg every 4-6 hours for upto 3 days. \u2022 Ascorbic acid is used in combination with Nacetylcysteine.\n\n-Its use is controversial. It works slowly and is used as adjunctive therapy. -Give 30 mg/kg q 6 h PO for seven or more treatments. \u2022 Cimetidine inhibits hepatic production of toxic intermediates.\n\n-Give 5 mg/kg q 8 h PO or parenterally for 3 days minimum.\n\nBlood transfusions and oxygen therapy should be given as needed.\n\nThe prognosis is guarded and is highly dependent on severity of intoxication and time lapse prior to treatment.\n\nAvoid drug overdosage.\n\nStore medication safely away from pets.\n\n\u2022 Lethargy, ataxia and anorexia < 3-4 days post-ingestion. \u2022 Jaundice commonly observed.\n\nIdiosyncratic hepatotoxicity is suspected. The dosage causing toxicity may range from 1 mg once daily to 2.5 mg twice daily.\n\nPrior sensitization to diazepam is not required.\n\nMost cats become lethargic, ataxic and anorectic within 96 hours following ingestion.\n\nJaundice is common and occurs during the first 11 days of illness.\n\nHistory of recent drug exposure.\n\nUnexplained and rapid increase in liver biochemical parameters. \u2022 Profound increases in ALT, AST and total bilirubin are present. \u2022 Hypoglycemia/hypocholesterolemia indicates severe hepatic insufficiency. \u2022 Abnormal coagulation tests (OSPT, APTT) suggest disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\nDeath occurs from acute hepatic failure.\n\n\u2022 Histologic review of tissue specimens reveals profound hepatocellular necrosis.\n\nA history of diazepam administration associated with fulminate hepatic failure make most other diseases unlikely.\n\nSupportive care as dictated by the patient.\n\nFluid therapy for hydration maintenance.\n\n\u2022 Add dextrose to combat hypoglycemia.\n\nMeet nutritional needs to facilitated hepatic regeneration. \u2022 Total parenteral nutrition or nasoesophageal catheter feeding.\n\nPlasma transfusions to replace consumed coagulation factors.\n\nPoor: cats presented in an obtunded condition warrant a grave prognosis.\n\nEvaluate baseline ALT and AST activities in cats prior to initiating daily oral treatment with diazepam.\n\n\u2022 Retest again 1 week after initiating therapy.\n\n\u2022 Discontinue diazepam therapy in cats with unexplained increases in liver enzyme activities.\n\nPeractin is a more effective appetite stimulant, and has not been reported to have serious idiosyncratic reactions.\n\n\u2022 Anorexia, weight loss, lethargy and jaundice. \u2022 Hepatomegaly or a normal-sized liver may be palpated.\n\nCirrhosis is a relatively uncommon disease in the cat but may occur as a progression of specific feline hepatopathies (e.g cholangiohepatitis, chronic biliary obstruction), systemic disorders (e.g., pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic renal disease), and possibly vascular and immune-mediated diseases.\n\nCirrhosis would appear to occur most frequently with diseases affecting the portal areas, specifically the bile ducts.\n\nCirrhosis is characterized by both fibrosis and the conversion of normal hepatic architecture into structurally abnormal (regenerative) nodules.\n\nAnorexia, weight loss and lethargy predominate.\n\nHepatomegaly and intermittent diarrhea may also be observed.\n\nJaundice is often present.\n\nCats usually have a previous diagnosis of chronic hepatopathy, such as cholangitis (cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis).\n\nLiver enzyme activities are variably increased depending upon the relative magnitude of cholestasis or hepatocellular inflammation.\n\nUltrasound may reveal diffuse parenchymal nodules and an irregular liver margin.\n\nHistologic evaluation of liver biopsy specimens is required for definitive diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 Microscopic lesions show both fibrosis and abnormal regenerative nodules. \u2022 Tissues may be obtained by ultrasound-guided biopsy, laparoscopy or via laparotomy. \u2022 Cirrhosis may be difficult to confirm by needle biopsy unless multiple sites are sampled. In practice, a small laparotomy incision and wedge biopsy of the liver gives a better diagnostic sample and is quick and simple. In cats with chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis, less than 40% of paired needle biopsy results may be in accordance with the wedge biopsy diagnosis. \u2022 Patients with cirrhosis may have occult bleeding tendencies. Screen for the presence of coagulopathy prior to liver biopsy by performing evaluation of a PIVKA assay or APTT/OSPT.\n\nCirrhosis is the end result of many different chronic liver disorders. Therefore, differentiation of the primary parenchymal disease leading to cirrhosis is generally not clinically relevant.\n\nStrategies for therapeutic support in cats with cirrhosis are first prioritized as to severity, and approached in a logical step-wise fashion. The presence of jaundice or ascites does not indicate a hopeless situation for medical treatment.\n\nFeed adequate calories (1.25-1.50 MER) to prevent further malnourishment. Use of enteral nutrition is strongly recommended in anorectic cats. Reduce dietary protein intake in cats with overt signs of hepatic encephalopathy (HE).\n\nSupplement water-soluble vitamins as needed at twice the normal dose. Use vitamin K in cats with biliary occlusion and elevated PIVKA or APTT/OSPT assays.\n\nControl signs of HE with antimicrobials, reduced protein diets and mucosal protectants (e.g., sucralfate). Vitamin K therapy may reduce GI bleeding which also contributes to HE.\n\nCorrect hydration deficits with intravenous fluids. Fluid choices are based on the presence of ascites and electrolyte status.\n\nUse low-salt diets, cage rest and diuretics for control of ascites.\n\nAntibiotics are indicated in patients with suppurative inflammation, fever and/or leukocytosis.\n\nUse anti-inflammatory (e.g., prednisone, azathioprine) drugs to reduce mononuclear cellular infiltrates.\n\nAnti-fibrotic agents, such as colchicine, D-penicillamine, may reduce hepatic fibrosis.\n\nActigal may cause choleresis and promote a more beneficial bile acid milieu.\n\nReduce free radical damage to hepatocytes by administration of S-adenosyl.\n\nThe prognosis in most animals with cirrhosis is poor.\n\n\u2022 Polyuria and polydipsia.\n\n\u2022 Increased appetite.\n\n\u2022 Weight loss with palpable hepatomegaly.\n\nPolyuria/polydipsia (PU/PD) are common.\n\nIncreased to ravenous appetite, although terminally it may be decreased.\n\nWeight loss with or without hepatomegaly.\n\nJaundice is an uncommon complication of diabetes. It is more commonly associated with sulfonylurea (e.g., glipizide) therapy. Approximately 20% of cats on sulfonylurea therapy develop increased liver enzymes and a small percentage become jaundiced.\n\nSuggested by salient clinical signs (PU/PD, alterations in appetite, weight loss).\n\nPersistent hyperglycemia observed on 2-3 occasions at least 3 hours apart over 24 hours.\n\nUrinalysis shows glucosuria, +/\u2212 ketonuria, +/\u2212 proteinuria and +/\u2212 bacteriuria.\n\nLiver biochemical parameters (ALT, ALP) are mildly to moderately increased.\n\nClassical signs\n\n\u2022 Most cats are > 10 years old.\n\n\u2022 More common in DSH.\n\n\u2022 Hepatomegaly +/mass lesion is often palpable.\n\nMost (60%) of cats have benign tumors.\n\nBile duct tumors may progress from benign to malignant lesions.\n\n\u2022 Benign lesions are usually focal and cystic; malignant tumors often involve multiple lobes.\n\nHepatomegaly is associated with extensive infiltrative disease.\n\nMetastasis is common with bile duct carcinomas.\n\nGenerally seen in geriatric cats (> 10 years old).\n\nMore common in DSH than in Siamese.\n\nAnorexia, lethargy and weakness are seen.\n\nHepatomegaly +/\u2212 mass lesion is often palpable.\n\nVariable elevation in hepatic biochemical parameters. In general, relative increases in ALP versus ALT activity are observed. However, dramatic increases in either liver enzyme may not be present even with moderately sized tumors.\n\nAbdominal imaging (survey radiographs, sonography) confirms hepatomegaly or mass.\n\n\u2022 Ultrasonography is useful in detecting involvement of multiple hepatic lobes and in obtaining a guided core biopsy of lesions.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis requires histologic evaluation of liver biopsy specimens.\n\nIt is important to distinguish benign from malignant hepatic tumors, as treatment and prognosis are widely divergent. Differentiation may only be made by histologic interpretation of hepatic biopsy specimens.\n\nSurgical resection (lobectomy) of benign hepatocellular or biliary tumors is recommended.\n\nChemotherapy is not useful for treatment of malignant neoplasia.\n\nThe prognosis for cats with benign tumors after resection is good. Most cats are disease free at least 1 year later.\n\nThe prognosis for malignant neoplasia is poor.\n\n\u2022 Rarely seen in cats < 8 years of age.\n\n\u2022 Weight loss, polyphagia and unthrifty appearance predominate. \u2022 Polyuria/polydipsia +/vomiting/diarrhea may be seen.\n\nLoss and a Good Appetite).\n\nClinical signs result from overproduction/secretion of thyroid hormones. Malignant thyroid tumors are rare.\n\nMore than 70% of hyperthyroid cats have bilateral thyroid adenomas or adenomatous hyperplasia.\n\nWeight loss, polyphagia and unkempt haircoat are common.\n\nVomiting and small bowel diarrhea may be observed.\n\nA reduced appetite is seen in about one in ten cats with hyperthyroidism.\n\nPanting and respiratory distress are observed with concomitant cardiac disease.\n\nSeen primarily in middle-aged and older cats.\n\nPhysical examination is suggestive.\n\n\u2022 Palpable thyroid gland enlargement is evident in 90% of cats if the examiner is experienced. \u2022 Patchy alopecia/unkempt haircoat, overgrown toe nails are often present. \u2022 Reduced muscle mass; most cats are thin.\n\nCardiac auscultation may reveal cardiac disturbances. \u2022 Tachycardia (>240 bpm), murmurs and/or a gallop rhythm suggest cardiac manifestations of thyrotoxicosis.\n\nIncreased liver enzyme (ALT, ALP) activities are seen in > 75% of hyperthyroid cats.\n\nClosely assess renal parameters (BUN, creatinine, urinalysis) as concomitant renal disease may be present.\n\nDemonstration of elevated basal serum thyroxine (T 4 ) concentration provides definitive diagnosis. \u2022 Suspicious cats with a \"borderline\" T 4 value should be retested. \u2022 Increased free T 4 may be observed in some cats with high normal total T 4 concentrations. \u2022 Alternatively, performance of a T 3 suppression test may discriminate between normal and mildly hyperthyroid cats.\n\nPerform thoracic radiography, electrocardiography (ECG), +/\u2212 echocardiography to rule out cardiac disease.\n\nSee page 424 under pre-hepatic causes for jaundice and page 432 for hepatic causes for jaundice (e.g. lymphosarcoma).\n\n\u2022 Young, outdoor cats (< 4 years old).\n\n\u2022 Lethargy, anorexia and weight loss.\n\n\u2022 Pale mucous membranes.\n\n\u2022 Mild to moderate respiratory signs (fever, dyspnea, tachypnea). \u2022 Occurs in central United States.\n\nThe etiologic agent is a soil-borne dimorphic fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum. The organism is likely inhaled and disseminates from the respiratory tract to multiple other sites in the body (e.g. liver).\n\nThe disease is of regional significance in the central United States, especially the Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys and Texas.\n\nPrimarily disease of young (< 4 years of age) outdoor cats.\n\nCats present with a vague history of an insidious chronic illness.\n\nLethargy, anorexia, weight loss and pale mucous membrane color are common.\n\nRespiratory distress (dyspnea/tachypnea) is seen in 50% of infected cats and occasionally coughing.\n\nLymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly are common.\n\nMild to moderate fever is usually present, but the temperature may be normal.\n\nIntestinal involvement may result in diarrhea and weight loss. On palpation thickened intestinal loops, mesenteric lymphadenopathy and/or hepato/splenomegaly may be evident.\n\nOcular involvement may cause granulomatous chorioretinitis, retinal detachment with blindness and optic neuritis.\n\nNon-regenerative anemia is typically present and neutrophilic leukocytosis. Severe pancytopenia is occasionally observed when there is bone marrow involvement.\n\nHyperproteinemia, hyperglobulinemia, +/\u2212 mild elevations of ALT may be observed.\n\nRadiographic imaging may aid diagnosis. \u2022 Survey thoracic radiographs show a diffuse pulmonary interstitial pattern suggesting fungal pneumonia. \u2022 Symmetrical hepatomegaly is observed on survey abdominal radiographs/ultrasonography.\n\nDefinitive diagnosis requires demonstration of organisms in infected tissues.\n\n\u2022 Potential diagnostic modalities include bronchoalveolar lavage, fine-needle aspiration and exfoliative cytology, and tissue biopsy.\n\nSerologic tests for antibodies directed against Histoplasma antigens are not recommended, as falsenegative results are common in cats with naturally occurring disease.\n\nNeoplasia and other systemic mycoses may produce similar signs to histoplasmosis.\n\n\u2022 Cats with histoplasmosis (and other mycoses) tend to be younger than cats with neoplasia. \u2022 Serologic testing may be useful in detecting cats with cryptococcosis.\n\nCombination chemotherapy with amphotericin B and itraconazole (5 mg/kg PO q 12 h), or high loading doses (10 mg/kg PO q 12-24 h) of itraconazole.\n\nGenerally treat for 4-6 months but dependent on remission of signs.\n\nSee page 26 for details of amphotericin treatment in cats (Cryptococcus in The Cat With Signs of Chronic Nasal Disease).\n\nFair to good with disseminated disease depending on the severity of fungal involvement and the chronicity.\n\nEmaciated cats with advanced disseminated disease have a poor prognosis and they may not live long enough for the treatment to take effect.\n\n\u2022 Progressive anorexia, lethargy and marked jaundice. \u2022 Vomiting and fever may be episodic. \u2022 Hepatomegaly. \u2022 +/acholic feces.\n\nObstruction of the extrahepatic biliary system has diverse causes, including pancreatic disease, neoplasia, cholelithiasis and extrinsic compression (masses). Consequences of biliary obstruction include cell membrane and organelle injury due to stagnation of bile acids and other injurious substances. Pancreatitis and neoplasia are the most common causes. \u2022 Pancreatitis may cause obstructive jaundice through direct cholangiohepatic injury via refluxed pancreatic secretions, pancreatic fibrosis and/or obstruction of the common bile duct within a few weeks following pancreatic injury. \u2022 Neoplasia (e.g., pancreatic adenocarcinoma) may cause slowly progressive external compression of the major bile ducts, resulting in obstructed biliary flow and jaundice.\n\nComplete occlusion leads to cholestasis, hepatomegaly and dilatation of intrahepatic biliary structures.\n\nObstruction of bile flow incites biliary tract/hepatocellular inflammation and injury.\n\n\u2022 Permanent biliary tract dilatation and hepatic fibrosis may be seen with chronic extrahepatic biliary obstruction.\n\nAnorexia, lethargy and marked jaundice which are progressive.\n\nCyclical vomiting and fever.\n\nHepatomegaly may be palpable.\n\nAcholic feces are occasionally seen with complete obstruction.\n\nAcute pancreatitis may cause anorexia, lethargy, abdominal pain and jaundice as a consequence of extrahepatic biliary obstruction.\n\nPancreatic abscesses, cysts and neoplasia may cause signs of extrahepatic biliary obstruction.\n\nNon-regenerative anemia and possibly a neutrophilic leukocytosis are seen.\n\nIncreased liver biochemical parameters are commonly observed.\n\n\u2022 Dramatic elevations in serum total bilirubin concentration. Elevations may occur as rapidly as 4 hours following complete biliary obstruction. \u2022 Increased ALP and GGT activities occur secondary to cholestasis. A 3-5-fold increase in GGT and 2-10-fold rise in ALP are often present. \u2022 Increased ALT (up to 10-fold) and 3-10-fold increased AST activities reflect hepatocellular injury.\n\nAn antemortem diagnosis of pancreatitis causing obstructive jaundice is elusive.\n\n\u2022 Variable leukocytosis with elevation of liver biochemical parameters (total bilirubin, ALP, ALT) are present. \u2022 Recent studies show that elevation in feline pancreatic-like immunoreactivity assay (fPLI) may provide presumptive serologic evidence of pancreatitis. Serum fPLI appears to be more sensitive and more specific than serum feline trypsin-like immunoreactivity assay (fTLI) or abdominal ultrasonography. \u2022 Ultrasonography demonstrates a generalized loss of pancreatic echogenicity with pancreatitis in most cases.\n\nUltrasonography may confirm the presence of a pancreatic mass and/or extrahepatic biliary obstruction causing extrahepatic biliary obstruction.\n\n\u2022 Diagnosis of extrahepatic biliary obstruction is confirmed on ultrasonographic evaluation or exploratory surgery.\n\n\u2022 Sonography shows a distended/tortuous common bile duct, large gall bladder and distended intrahepatic biliary ducts. These findings may be observed as early as 5-7 days post-obstruction when viewed by an experienced sonographer.\n\nThe historical, clinical and laboratory features of extrahepatic biliary obstruction may be indistinguishable from other severe cholestatic hepatopathies.\n\nAbdominal ultrasonography is the quickest and least invasive means to confirm extrahepatic biliary obstruction.\n\nFirst stabilize the patient with fluid and electrolyte therapy.\n\nPerform a laparotomy for inspection/correction of the biliary tract obstructive lesion.\n\n\u2022 Prompt correction of complete obstruction via performance of cholecystoduodenostomy or cholecystojejunostomy is recommended. \u2022 Broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated if biliaryenteric anastomosis is performed.\n\nExtrahepatic biliary obstruction caused by pancreatitis may be amenable to medical therapy (dietary modification, IV fluids, antiemetics, etc.).\n\n\u2022 Biliary decompression is recommended in pancreatitis patients with rising hype bilirubinemia or sonographic evidence of worsening gall bladder distention.\n\nSpecific therapy for hepatocellular inflammation (confirmed by biopsy) and intrahepatic cholestasis may be required.\n\n\u2022 Use ursodeoxycholic acid (10 mg/kg PO q 12 h) for 5-7 days post-operatively to reduce cholestatic injury.\n\nGuarded to good depending upon the underlying cause.\n\nBiochemical abnormalities associated with extraheptic biliary obstruction subside quickly following successful surgery.\n\n\u2022 Abdominal pain, fever, vomiting.\n\n\u2022 +/jaundice.\n\n\u2022 Palpable right cranial abdominal mass.\n\nAbdominal pain, fever, vomiting and jaundice.\n\nA mass lesion may be palpable in the cranial abdomen.\n\nAnimals may present in endotoxic shock with gall bladder rupture.\n\nInflammation of the gall bladder is uncommon.\n\nInflammation may occur from occlusion of the cystic duct, with resultant gall bladder inflammation resulting from bile stasis. Occlusion may occur due to extraluminal compression (e.g., mass, adhesion) or intraluminal obstruction as seen with cholelithiasis.\n\nEmphysematous cholecystitis is most commonly observed in association with diabetes mellitus, acute cholecystitis with/without cholelithiasis, and traumatic ischemia of the gall bladder.\n\nE. coli bacteria are most commonly cultured from the biliary tree of affected cats.\n\nMost animals have a variable leukocytosis.\n\nHepatic biochemical parameters (total bilirubin, ALT and ALP) are modestly increased.\n\nUltrasonography or laparotomy is usually necessary for a diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 Gas accumulation within the biliary tree/gall bladder indicates cholecystitis. \u2022 Choleliths may be an uncommonly recognized incidental finding. \u2022 Cranial abdominal fluid accumulation indicates biliary rupture and peritoneal inflammation. Analysis of peritoneal effusion reveals the presence of inflammatory cells (e.g., neutrophils, macrophages) and bilirubin crystals in a turbid golden-brown or green fluid.\n\nLaparotomy allows for cholecystectomy and treatment of peritonitis.\n\nSurgically remove calculi causing clinical signs of hepatobiliary disease.\n\nAssess patency of biliary tree during surgery. If the gallbladder appears inflamed, consider cholecystectomy.\n\n\u2022 Administer vitamin K 12-24 hours prior to surgical intervention. \u2022 Perform concurrent liver biopsy to assess the extent of hepatic inflammation.\n\nCulture bile fluid for the presence of aerobic/anaerobic bacterial pathogens.\n\n\u2022 Use broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy effective against enteric pathogens. Good first-choice drugs which reach therapeutic biliary concentrations include cephalosporins, penicillins, doxycycline, metronidazole, clindamycin and the quinolones. Base antimicrobial therapy on the results obtained from biliary culture and susceptibility testing.\n\nFluid therapy is administered to hypovolemic cats or those requiring correction of electrolyte derangements.\n\nThe prognosis in most cases is guarded. Those cats which are not extremely debilitated or that have necrotizing cholecystitis have a more favorable prognosis.\n\n\u2022 Malaise, weight loss.\n\n\u2022 Low-grade abdominal pain.\n\n\u2022 Abdominal effusion +/jaundice.\n\nThere is often a history of trauma.\n\nGeneral malaise, weight loss and abdominal pain predominate.\n\nAbdominal effusion +/\u2212 jaundice may be present. Intervals ranging from 3 days to 3 weeks before the presentation may be observed.\n\nRupture of the extrahepatic biliary tree may occur with blunt or penetrating abdominal trauma, necrotizing cholecystitis and cholelithiasis (rare). Leakage of significant volumes of bile into the peritoneal cavity induces tissue inflammation. Unconjugated bile acids are most irritating, as they alter the permeability of vascular structures within the peritoneal membranes.\n\nAltered membrane permeability promotes transmural bacterial migration into the peritoneal cavity, septic inflammation and septicemia.\n\nNon-septic inflammation causes intra-abdominal fluid sequestration, contraction of circulating blood volume and dehydration which may induce hypovolemic shock.\n\nSuggestive history with other evidence of trauma.\n\nLiver enzymes (ALP, ALT) are mildly to moderately increased. Moderate-to-severe hyperbilirubinemia is often present.\n\nCytologic examination of abdominal effusion confirms the diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 The effusion is turbid and golden brown-to-green in appearance. Inflammatory cells (macrophages and neutrophils) and bilirubin crystals are generally seen.\n\nImmediate surgical correction of bile leakage.\n\n\u2022 Perform cholecystectomy if concurrent necrotizing cholecystitis is present. \u2022 Provide adequate post-operative drainage.\n\nCorrect fluid and electrolyte derangements intravenously using a balanced electrolyte solution with electrolyte supplements as needed. Colloids may be needed for correction of hypoalbuminemia if present.\n\nBroad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, as per cholecystitis, if septicemia is present.\n\nA guarded prognosis is warranted in most cats. Cats having pronounced effusion, chronic debilitation, or clinical evidence of sepsis at the time of diagnosis have a poor prognosis."}
