{"title": "Archives of Virology Morphological and Bioloflieal Properties of a New Coronavirus Assoeiated with Diarrhea in Infant Miee", "body": "Among the coronaviruses, there are strains that cause intestinal infections leading to enteritis and diarrhea in swine (11, 25) , calves (4, 19, 23) , rodents (21) and possibly man (9) .\n\nRecently, a new viral agent (DVIM) was isolated from an infant mouse with diarrhea, by the utilization of cultured cells. It has also been shown by complement fixation tests that this new isolate is antigenically related to known coronaviruses, avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and mouse hepatitis virus strain-2 (MHV-2). The viral agent was propagated in BALB/c-3T3 cells with the formation of sync)~ia and caused hemadsorption and hemagglutination of mouse or rat erythrocytes (24), 17\" 0304-8608/81/0067/0241 / $ 02.20 (18, 26) .\n\nA virus isolated from t h e intestine of a n i n f a n t mouse w i t h clinical signs of diarrhea, d e s i g n a t e d DVIM, was generously p r o v i d e d b y Dr. K o z a b u r o Sato (Central L a b o r a t o r y of Shionogi P h a r m .

A t designated intervals cover-slips t r e a t e d or u n t r e a t e d w i t h erythrocytes were rinsed five t i m e s w i t h eold-PBS, fixed w i t h g l u t a r a l d e h y d e (4 p e r cent in PBS), dried in a criticaLpoint dryer a n d coated w i t h gold-palladium alloy in v a c u u m (10 -6 tort) a n d e x a m i n e d b y SEM. tubes were collected r a n d o m l y a n d e x a m i n e d for extracellular virus (ECV).

Hyperimmune Serum H y p e r i m m u n e serum a g a i n s t purified D V I M was p r e p a r e d in a r a b b i t as follows: F o r t h e first a n d second inoculation, virus was injected i n t r a m u s c u l a r l y w i t h a n equal v o l u m e of complete F r e u n d ' s a d j u v a n t within a three-week interval, a n d a booster injection was given w i t h o u t a d j u v a n t t h r e e weeks a f t e r t h e second-injection. A n t ib o d y t i t e r for t h e i m m u n e serum was d e t e r m i n e d as 2,048 a n d 1,024 in h e m a g g l u t i n ation a n d n e u t r a l i z a t i o n test respectively.\n\nI n f e c t e d cell cultures on coverslips were fixed w i t h acetone at 4 \u00b0 C for t5 m i n u t e s a n d tile indirect m e t h o d using r a b b i t a n t i -D V I M s e r u m a n d fluoresceine isothioc y a n a t e -e o n j u g a t e d g o a t a n t i -r a b b i t globulin was applied.\n\nVirus samples were negatively stained with 2 per cent potassium phosphotungstate (pH 6.5) and examined in JEM-100B electron microscope.\n\nThe eytopathic effect of DVIM was characterized by the formation of syncytia in BALB/e-3 T 3 cell cultures.\n\nWhen cells were infected at low multiplicities of infection (approximately, M O I = 0 . 1 ) , small syneytia were detectable at 8 hours p.i. At 18 to 24 hours p.i., all areas of the cell sheet consisted of syncytia. Subsequently, syneytial lysis began from the center of each syncytium and progressed toward the periphery. The relationships between virus production and formation of syncytium were examined by a comparison of HA titers of the culture fluid with the cell-fusion ratio during the replicative cycle oi the virus (Fig. 1) . As can be seen from Fig. 1 , HA activity was detected at 8 hours p.i. but development of syncytium lagged behind. Maximum syneytium development occurred between 12 and 18 p.i. HA titers reached a peak by 11 hours p.i. and remained constant. The surface of uninfected cells were covered with microvilli (Fig. 3A) , as previously shown for many celt lines, but following infection with DVIM (t0 hours p.i.) the surface area of syney\u00a2ia were shown to be covered with a large number of spherical buds (Fig. 3B) . The buds were moderately pleomorphic in shape, approximately 100--130 nm in diameter. Particles of a similar size were not detected on the surface of uninfected cells. Therefore we conclude those particles are budding virions. This conclusion is further substa.ntiated by the observation that mouse erythrocytes were exclusively adsorbed to syncy~ia. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4A the size of the syneytia could be delineated by the location of adsorbed erythrocytes. At a high magnification, a large number of particles were etearly visible in the area of hemadsorption (Fig. 4B ). Fig. 5 shows the growth curve of DVIM in BALB/c-3T3 cells. The production of CAV was detected within 4 hours p.i., followed by a rapid exponential increase. At 6 hours p.i., CAV titer reached a maximum level (105.3 TCIDs0/0.1 ml). The production of ECV was later than that of CAV, but the titer was 105.3 TCID50/ 0.1 ml at 10 hours p.i. Although syncytium formation was very rarely detected at 6 hours p.i., approximately 80 per cent of the cells were fused by 18 hour and detachment from the glass surface followed. H A titers of CAV increased rapidly from 4 to 6 hours p.i. corresponding to a rapid increase in virus production from 10 \u00b0.s to 105.a TCIDs0/0.i ml, and ~he titer continued to increase until 8 hours p.i. HA titers of ECV were delayed by approximately 2 hours compared to those of CAV. Infectivity of CAV and ECV decreased from 12 hours p.i., corresponding to rapid degeneration of infected cells and possibly virions, while the HA titer of ECV remained constant until 24 hours p.i. at 37 \u00b0 C. The estimated time required for one step growth of DVIM was approximately 6 hours. \n\nAn eleetron-mierograph of partially purified DVIM is shown in Fig. 6 . The diameter of virions varied from 100 to 110 nm, excluding the surface projections. The projections formed a fringe radiating from the viral envelope and they appeared to be club-shaped, 20 nm in length and t0 nm in width at the distal end of the projections. In addition, noticeable structures which consisted of apparent additional small granular projections were observed. These small projections were 5 nm in length and firmly fixed on the viral envelope. Purified virus partieles, in mcsg of the preparations, were only partially covered by club-shaped projections but always covered with small granular projections, even after a considerable period of sonieation. Fig. 7 shows the negatively stained DVIM particles after sonication at 20 l(Hz for 10 minutes. Although club-shaped projections had completely disappeared, small projections were still present on the surface of partially disrupted virions. Furthermore, the inner structure of the virion was clearly observed after sonieation suggesting penetration of the stain. The thickness of the envelope was measured as 10 nm and a fine filamentous structure, irregularly tangled, was observed in broken virions.\n\nRecently, some viral agents, which are responsible for diarrhea of new-borne mice, have been classified, geovirus is a major cause of routine diarrhea. (8) . Epizootic diarrhea of infant mice (EDIM) virus is now classified as a rotavirus by HOLMES st al. (15) . Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of coronaviruses, has been described as a common cause of enteric infection in baby mice (8, 21) . On the other hand, lethal intestinal virus of infant mice (LIVIM), first described by K~AST, is probably the most important viral agent of diarrhea in new-born mice (3, 17) , but there was no viral agent detected. However, the epidemiological and pathological characterization of diarrhea of new-borne mice is consistent with the recorded pathology of LIVIM, and suggests that a MHV could be the cause of this disease (5, 7, 14, 16) .\n\nPrevious results reported by SATO st al. (22) indicated that the infectious agent (DVIM) isolated from the intestine of mice with diarrhea possesses I~NA and lipid. The agent passes through a 100 nm filter but not a 50 nm filter. Serologically, DVIM was shown to be related to IBV and MHV-2 by a complement fixation test but they were clearly distinguishable from each other by neutralization assays. These observations suggested that this new isolate, DVIM, is a member of coronavirus. However, it was important to establish the morphological characteristics of purified DVIM, since eoronavirus classification, is established mainly by means of characteristic morphology at present.\n\nThe results presented in this report showed that diameter of virion was approximately 100 nm, excluding surface projections. Characteristic coronavirus projections attached to the virion were demonstrable. However morphologically DVIM appears to be slightly different in that additional small granular projections were observed. A similar small projection on enteric bovine coronavirus has been reported recently (4) . But no additional projection has been detected on MHV-2, propagated and purified in the same manner as DVIM (data not shown). The morphological relationships of the two projections, club-shaped and granular, are at present not clear. However, it is possible that the club-shaped projection might be attached to the granular projection. Moreover, the HA activity of DVIM was only slightly affected by sonication, which suggests that the HA activity of ])VIM might be associated with the small granular projection.\n\nWe showed by SEN that a large number of particles were present on the DVIM-induced syncytia but not on uninfected cells. The size of the particle was similar to that of negatively stained DVIM, while hemadsorption was restricted to the cells which possess surface particles. The surface profile of DVIMinfected cells has a prominent resemblance to the cells infected with ortho-or para-myxoviruses (1, 12, 27). As described previously (240, it is clear that the hemadsorption of DVIM was not due to the \"pseudohemadsorption\" (6). These observations suggest that DVIM particles are assembled and bud through the plasma membrane of syncytium.\n\nIn addition to these morphological properties, the existence of HA and receptor destroying activities as described previously (24), have not been reported for any of the other routine coronaviruses. Several studies of coronaviruses by the thin sections and transmissible electron microscopy show unequivocally that coronaviruses are formed by budding from the surface of intracellular cistelme (2, 10, 13,  20) . The more detailed morphogenesis of DVIM remains to be investigated in future."}
