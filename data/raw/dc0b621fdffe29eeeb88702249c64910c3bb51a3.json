{"title": "Gastrointestinal tract symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019: Analysis of clinical symptoms in adult patients", "body": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has recently become a global pandemic. 1 Fever and cough are the most common clinical presentations. [2] [3] Gastrointestinal tract symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea are often seen in coronavirus infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). [4] [5] Recent studies report that gastrointestinal tract symptoms are rarely observed in COVID-19 patients, 2-3 observed in about 3.0% of cases. However, a US report revealed that the first patient experienced 2 continuous days of diarrhoea on Day 6 after disease onset. 6 Are gastrointestinal tract symptoms rare in COVID-19?\n\nWe recently worked in a mobile cabin hospital and conducted a detailed investigation of the clinical symptoms of patients with COVID-19.\n\nThis study was reviewed by the ethics committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Ethics Approval No.: WDRY2020-K033) and written informed consent from patients was waived. Only verbal explanation was required, and verbal informed consent was obtained from the patients.\n\nHardcopy forms were formulated and printed. From February 18 to March 2, 2020, COVID-19 patients \u2265 16 years of age in Wuchang mobile cabin hospital were recruited. The patients themselves completed a form that collected general demographic information, current medical history, past medical history, date of first positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid result, chest CT result, and COVID-19 contact history. COVID-19-related clinical symptoms were listed with tick boxes in the form. The study participants were asked to check the boxes of their recent symptoms All rights reserved.

All patients in this mobile cabin hospital were long-time residents of Wuhan and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and their diseases were classified as mild and moderate COVID-19 according to the diagnostic criteria in Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (trial edition 5). 7 After patients completed the hardcopy forms, photographs were taken, and the data were uploaded onto the network. Before the mobile cabin hospital was closed, the hardcopy forms were destroyed as medical waste. Kolmogorov-Smimov test was used to determine whether the data were normally distributed.\n\nContinuous variables were expressed as the means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as the counts and percentages in each category. We grouped patients into diarrhoea and non-diarrhoea Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were applied to continuous variables, chi-square tests and Fisher's exact tests were used for categorical variables as appropriate. To identify risk factors for COVID-19, Pearson's chi-squared test was used for correlation analysis. Differences with a P-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. All rights reserved.

Nasal congestion, myalgia, headache, chills, fever, fatigue, and coughing were common initial symptoms, whereas gastrointestinal tract symptoms were rare initial symptoms. In this study, 5 (2.4%) patients had an initial symptom of diarrhoea, whereas most patients developed diarrhoea 5.00(0.25-11.00) days (median) after the development of initial symptoms (Figure 3 ).

Diarrhoea was not associated with sex or disease course(P>0.05), and old age might be a protective factor against diarrhoea (OR, 0.552, 95%CI (0.319-0.955))( Table 1) .\n\nCoronavirus is a large virus family that can cause various conditions ranging from the common cold to severe infectious diseases such as SARS and MERS.8 COVID-19 is a recently discovered infection in humans and is now considered a pandemic. 1, 9 The most common clinical presentations associated with coronavirus infection are fever and cough. [2] [3] 9 The results of this study have further proven previous conclusions. Studies have found that gastrointestinal tractsymptoms are one of the common clinical presentations in SARS and MERS. [4] [5] 9 However, recent studies found that diarrhoea is rare in COVID-19, 2-3,10 with an incidence of about 3%. A US study reported that their first patient, who had mild COVID-19, developed diarrhoea lasting for 2 days. 6 In addition, a study reported that diarrhoea may be an initial symptom of COVID-19. 11 In this study, we found that a minority of patients had an initial symptom of diarrhoea. In contrast to the results of previous studies, this study found that diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting are common in COVID-19. Why are there differences between the results of this study and other past clinical investigations? First, the data sources of these studies vary. The information used by Zhong et al. was obtained from medical records, 3, 10 whereas the data in this study was provided by the patients themselves. Even though this is a retrospective study, the study subjects were adults and most had an educational level of middle school and above, thereby ensuring the reliability and authenticity of the content of this study. Second, the time nodes of the data records are different. The results of this study found that diarrhoea mostly occurred 5 days after the development of initial symptoms; therefore, patients may not have developed gastrointestinal tract symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting in the other studies. In this study, the mean disease course when patients underwent All rights reserved.

For example, Gong et al. showed that the mean disease course of deceased patients was 10.56 \u00b1 4.42 days. 12 Furthermore, in contrast to cough and other symptoms, diarrhoea in COVID-19 patients lasted for a short duration and mostly occurred as mushy stools instead of watery diarrhoea in SARS. 4 Therefore, diarrhoea may be overlooked by clinicians and patients during COVID-19. As digestive tract symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting tend to be overlooked in 15 Our study showed that digestive tract symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting are common in COVID-19, suggesting that the possibility of fecal-oral transmission is high. Therefore, we need to actively promote hand hygiene to prevent this disease. Moreover, public health authorities need to actively manage digestive tract excretions from patients to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nAs the subjects of this study are patients with mild cases in mobile cabin hospitals, we were unable to determine whether gastrointestinal tract symptoms are common in severe patients. Therefore, we can only suggest that digestive tract symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, and All rights reserved.

At present, no large-scale study has discovered the SARS-CoV-2 virus in fecal samples. 14 Therefore, a large sample size of COVID-19 patients is required for a study in which stool samples should be collected approximately one week after the onset of initial clinical symptoms in COVID-19 patients to assess the proportion of COVID-19 patients with stool samples containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This will provide valuable evidence to support aggressive public health strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, gastrointestinal tract symptoms are common in COVID-19 and most occur during the middle stage of the disease and lasts for a short period of time. Clinicians need to pay greater attention to the gastrointestinal tract symptoms of COVID-19."}
