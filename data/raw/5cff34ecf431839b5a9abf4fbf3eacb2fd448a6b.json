{"title": "A rational approach to selective pharmacophore designing: an innovative strategy for specific recognition of Gsk3 \u03b2", "body": "Herein, we introduce a novel computational screening strategy, which considers both the ligand features and receptor information for the identification of target-specific inhibitors. This rational approach includes deriving energy based pharmacophores [E-pharmacophores] from individual protein and using them to build selective pharmacophores, which are then sequentially employed to screen chemical databases. The selective pharmacophore model ensures that all essential features of each individual protein required for inhibition are conserved and taken into consideration during the sequential screening. Further, it also confirms that the final hits will have all essential features required for the selectivity towards single protein. To the best of our knowledge, this methodology has not been previously described to identify any selective inhibitors. In the present article, this unique strategy has been demonstrated by implementing on the classical example of glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (Gsk3\u03b2) and cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) off-target toxicity.\n\nToxicity is a leading cause of attrition at all stages of the drug development process. Most of the safety-related attrition occurs at the preclinical level, earlier to which designing process might have exacted major portion of both time and money of the pharmaceutical companies [1] . Despite the tremendous advances in the science and technology of drug development, strangely there are no efficient approaches to tackle off-target effects of drugs. The consequences of off-target toxicity are increasing apace, prompting a desperate need of effective strategies against molecular cross-talking. Toxicity of drug is attributed by the molecular features that ensue in molecular cross-talk with different proteins rather than targeted protein. Hence, there is a burgeoning need to develop inhibitors that bind selectively to the target protein to address the toxicity related attritions [2, 3] .\n\nGsk3\u03b2 is a highly conserved evolutionary serine-threonine kinase. Historically, it was depicted as a central protein required in glycogen metabolism [4] . However, mounting evidence indicates that Gsk3\u03b2 is a multifunctional enzyme involved in various crucial pathways such as the insulin signaling [5] and the Wnt pathway [6] , and plays a crucial role in the synaptic plasticity [7] and memory formation [8] . Most significant functions of this kinase are its role in the phosphorylation of apoptotic regulators and other cell death related factors, thus promoting the cellular degeneration [9, 10] . Hence, Gsk3\u03b2 has emerged as one of the most attractive therapeutic targets for the development of selective antogonists as promising new drugs for numerous debilitating diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, ischemic stroke, chronic inflammatory processes, cancer and diabetes [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .\n\nMost of the Gsk3\u03b2 inhibitors developed thus far often show off-target effects due to serious limitations in their specificity. The low specificity of these inhibitors is due to the fact that the ATP binding site is highly conserved among diverse protein kinases. Even an extremely promising Gsk3\u03b2 antagonist, can produce off-target effects by inducing changes in protein kinases, especially CDK1 or CDK2. CDK1 and CDK2 are archetypical kinases and central regulators that drive cells through G2 phase and mitosis, the inhibition of these key proteins has negative consequences on cell-cycle progression. As CDKs and Gsk3\u03b2 belong to the same family of CMGC kinases, they share a high degree of sequence and structural homology [16] . Hence, a strategy should be implemented to develop Gsk3\u03b2 selective inhibitors which perceptively exclude CDK1 and CDK2. To achieve these goals, we have (1) exploited the energetic analysis of protein-ligand docking to elucidate the key features of proteins/ ligand molecular interactions, (2) employed the knowledgebased coherent poses to derive a structure-based pharmacophore for Gsk3\u03b2 and CDKs, (3) manually developed a selective pharmacophore by the visual analysis of all the three pharmacophores, and (4) applied the selective pharmacophore and virtual screening (VS) protocol to identify selective inhibitors of Gsk3\u03b2 with the exclusion ability against CDKs (Fig. 1 ).\n\nThe crystal structure of Gsk3\u03b2 (PDB ID: 3GB2, 1Q41), and CDK2 (PDB ID: 3S2P) complexed with their respective antagonists were obtained from Protein Data Bank. Since, Fig. 1 Pipeline depicting the selective inhibitor designing the crystal structure of CDK1 is not available we built a homology model from the reported structure of CDK2 and employed in molecular modeling. The 3D structure of protein complexes was prepared using the protein preparation wizard tool (Schrodinger, LLC, 2010); water molecules were deleted, bond orders were assigned, hydrogens were added and metals were treated appropriately when present. Next, the orientation of the side chain structures of Gln and Asn was flipped if necessary to provide the maximum degree of H-bond interactions. The charge state of his residues was optimized. Finally, a restrained minimization of the protein structure was performed using the OPLS force field with backbone atoms being fixed [17] .\n\nPrepared protein structures were used to generate Glide scoring grids for the subsequent docking calculations. To each of the crystal structures of protein, a grid box of default size (20 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 20 \u00c5) was centered on the corresponding active site position. Default parameters were used and no constraints were included during grid generation.\n\nThe information of a binding pocket of a protein for its ligand is very important for revealing true binding mechanism and conducting mutagenesis studies [18] [19] [20] [21] . The binding pocket consists of a set of residues that have at least one heavy atom with a distance 5.0 \u00c5 from any heavy atom of a ligand. Such a criterion was originally used to define the binding pocket of ATP in the Cdk5-Nck5a* complex [22] that has later proved quite useful in identifying functional domains and stimulating the relevant truncation experiments [23] . The similar approach has also been used to define the binding pockets of many other receptor-ligand interactions important for drug design [19, [24] [25] [26] [27] . Here, the binding pockets were manually defined by either selecting the amino acid residues that span the kinase domain or selecting the ligand present within the crystal structure.\n\nGeneration of selective pharmacophore model\n\nRecently developed E-pharmacophore approach of Schr\u00f6dinger was employed in the construction of these energy-optimized pharmacophores. The E-pharmacophore [28, 29] coalesces the ligand and receptor-based techniques. Here, we have used the inhibitor library to probe the pharmacophoric features that are necessary for the selective inhibition of Gsk3\u03b2. This method has the advantage of combining pharmacophore perception with protein-ligand energetic terms to rank the importance of pharmacophore features. This combined approach attempts to take a step beyond simple contact scoring, by incorporating structural and energetic information obtained by docking.\n\nThe library of 1,500 ligands for each protein was obtained from ChEMBL web site (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembldb/) and was used to probe the interaction types and chemically feasible geometries that are involved in the active site and ligand binding. The structures were annotated to expand protonation and tautomeric states using LigPrep [30] and ionization states at pH 7.0 \u00b1 2.0 with Epik [31] . The generated grid files from the prepared receptors of Gsk3\u03b2 and CDKs were used for the Glide_XP docking calculations. In Glide [32, 33] , the docking module \"write XP descriptor information\" option was enabled and rest of the parameters were kept as default. The XP scoring function was used to order the best ranked compounds and the specific interactions like \u03c0 -cation and \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 stacking. In brief, the docking models of the inhibitors were refined using Glide XP, the Glide XP scoring terms were computed, and the energies were mapped into atoms.\n\nThe E-pharmacophore sites were automatically generated with Phase [34] , using the default set of six chemical features: H-bond acceptor (A), H-bond donor (D), hydrophobic (H), negative ionizable (N), positive ionizable (P), and aromatic ring (R). In this manner, pharmacophores were derived for each of the proteins, representing Gsk3\u03b2, CDK1 and CDK2 and later were evaluated manually for the generation of selective models.\n\nThe best pharmacophore hypothesis, AADDRRR was selected based on the careful observations of the feature scores and alignment of ligand structures to the generated hypotheses. The selected 3D pharmacophore hypothesis encompassed the following features: two H-bond acceptors \n\nThe selective pharmacophore model (AADDRRR) was used as a query for retrieving potential inhibitors from the ZINC chemical database (13 million compounds). Virtual screening was carried out using zincPharmer [35, 36] that uses the pharmacophore to efficiently search the ZINC database of fixed conformers for pharmacophore matches. To accomplish the best 3D similarity search, we used constraints that included a maximum of 0.5 RMSD, obeying 15 rotatable bond cutoff and molecular weight range of 180-500 Dalton. The compounds that matched well with the pharmacophoric features of the AADDRRR hypothesis were retrieved as hits and were considered for molecular docking studies.\n\nDocking study was performed using Glide running on Windows XP. The Glide algorithm estimates a systematic search of positions, orientations, and conformations of the ligand in the enzyme-binding pocket via a series of hierarchical filters. The shape and properties of the receptor are symbolized on a grid by various dissimilar sets of fields that furnish precise scoring of the ligand pose.\n\nThe potential hit compounds with lowest RMSD and standard molecular weights were considered for the docking analysis. All the hits were subjected to hydrogen additions, removal of salt, ionization and generation of low-energy ring conformations using LigPrep [37, 38] . The tautomers for each of these ligands were generated and optimized. Partial atomic charges were computed using the OPLS-2005 force field. The VS workflow in Maestro was used to dock and to score the lead-like compounds. In the first step, Glide was run in high-throughput virtual screen mode. 10 % of the top-scoring ligands were kept to move onto the Glide Single Precision (SP), stage. 5 % of the top-scoring leads from Glide-SP were retained and docked with Glide XP. Default values were accepted for van der Waals scaling and input partial charges were used. During the docking process, the G-score was used to select the best conformation for each ligand. G-score is based on the ChemScore, but includes a steric-clash term and adds buried polar atoms devised by the Schrodinger to penalize electrostatic mismatches: G-score = 0.065*vdW + 0.130*Coul + Lipo + Hbond + BuryP + RotB + site.\n\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of the described strategy, an additional docking experiment was carried out to compare the selective ability of our method with previously reported computational approaches for the identification of Gsk3\u03b2 inhibitors. Here, we selected 15 potent ligands reported earlier for Gsk3\u03b2 inhibition [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . These ligands were prepared using the LigPrep and conformational flexibility was sought through the ConfGen tool of the Schrodinger suite. Finally, the low-energy 3D structures of all the ligands were generated and employed in XP docking into the active sites of Gsk3\u03b2, CDK1, and CDK2. \n\nGeneration of selective pharmacophore model\n\nThe E-pharmacophore is a unique strategy, which blends the beneficial aspects of structure-based and ligand-based techniques. Mounting evidence indicates the advantage of incorporating protein-ligand interactions over the analysis with conventional ligand information alone. Here, we have used the inhibitor library for each protein to probe the pharmacophoric features that are necessary for the selective inhibition of Gsk3\u03b2 [47] [48] [49] [50] . This method has the advantage of combining pharmacophore perception with protein-ligand energetic terms to rank the importance of pharmacophore features. This protein-ligand based approach attempts to take a step beyond simple contact scoring by incorporating structural and energetic information using the scoring function in glide extra precision (XP).\n\nOverall, 15 pharmacophore sites were predicted for each protein. The pharmacophore hypotheses of Gsk3\u03b2, CDK1, and CDK2 were analyzed carefully and as expected the pharmacophore hypotheses exhibited high degree of similarity with each other, especially at the base recognition part of the kinases (ADR of the all pharmacophore models) (Fig. 2) . From this, we understand that an ideal pharmacophore should possess these features, in addition to which we have to redact few discriminating features. By careful observation of the protein structure and pharmacophore, we concluded that the addition of donor and aromatic features 5 \u00c5 above to the base recognition features would be ideal exclusion strategy. The final hypothesis AADDRRR consists of two H-bond acceptors (A), two H-bond donor (D), and three aromatic ring (R) features. Inter-site distances between each feature are shown in Fig. 3 .The H-donor (D7) maps to the carboxylic group of the Asp133, while the H-bond acceptor (A4) maps to the peptidyl amino group of the Val135, indicating a strong influence on possible inhibition. Two aromatic features (R13 and R15) occupy the hydrophobic cleft in the base recognition site. While the acceptor (A5) and aromatic (R14) features are crucial for selectivity, spans ribose pocket of the active site (Fig. 4) . The ribose pocket of the Gsk3\u03b2 is comparatively wider than both CDK1 and CDK2, hence the former can tolerate bulkier groups at this position when compared to CDKs. Thus, these energetically favorable features encompass the specific interactions required for the selectivity of the Gsk3\u03b2 protein, and this information should prove helpful in the development of new Gsk3\u03b2 inhibitors.\n\nPharmacophore-based methods have been widely used in virtual screening [48, [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . Application of structure-based pharmacophore in VS provides an advantage over the ligandbased pharmacophore approach as it uses the spatial information of the target protein for topological description of ligand-receptor interactions. It also provides an efficient alternative to docking-based VS, while continuing to represent specific ligand-protein interactions. Moreover, recent studies indicated that the structure-based pharmacophore approach provided more detailed information and accuracy in its description of ligand binding than ligand-based methods.\n\nVS was performed to identify possible lead compounds from the zinc database. The zinc chemical database with drug-like compounds consisting of over 13 million structurally diverse small molecules was screened with this query using the zincPharmer tool. A molecule which fits well with the pharmacophoric features, AADDRRR, was retrieved as a hit. Since the active site of Gsk3\u03b2 is large, the hits may be larger in size and may violate the Lipinski's rule of five. To avoid possible inappropriate predictions, the molecular weight cutoff of 180-500 dalton range, RMSD of 0.5 and cutoff limit of 15 rotatable bonds filters were applied. Altogether, 3D structural query retrieved 1,206 compounds from the ZINC database.\n\nMolecular docking is a computational technique that tries to predict most desirable conformation of the ligand that fits into the receptor site of the protein. Docking is espe-cially useful as second step of the virtual screening for the identification of molecules that can fit into the pharmacophore.\n\nTo further refine the retrieved hits and also to remove the false positives, VS hits were prepared using LigPrep and docked into the Gsk3\u03b2 and CDKs using Glide. Further, the low-energy stereoisomers for each structure were generated; ultimately giving rise to 2534 isomers. Docking calculations were carried out using the VS workflow, a docking interface in the Schr\u00f6dinger software. Finally, the binding modes of ten structures for each protein obtained by docking were ranked 5 ) exhibited all the conventional interactions that are required for the inhibition of kinase activity, viz. interfering with the ATP biding ability of Asp133 and Val135 and hydrophobic interactions with the hydrophobic cleft formed by Lys85, Val70, Ile62, Leu188, Cys199, and Val110. The hinge residues depicted H-bond interactions with ligand and occupy H-donor (D7) and Hbond acceptor (A4) of the pharmacophore. While, hydrophobic cleft maps to the two aromatic features (R13 and R15) of the AADDRRR hypothesis. However, the docking of these ligands to the CDKs protein did not show any of these interactions, suggesting the low affinity of these ligands to the CDK active site (Table 1b, c). By visualizing Fig. 6 , we can assume that the aromatic group (R14) faces steric clashes with Gly13, Glu 12, Asn133, Gln132, and Glu163 residues of CDKs, whereas R14 was well tolerated by Gsk3\u03b2. Because of the steric clashes, the ligands in the active site of the CDKs tend to disorient, ensuing low affinity of these ligands to the CDK active site.\n\nIn order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we performed the comparative docking analysis on fifteen GSK3\u03b2 ligands collected from previously reported computational work. All these ligands were employed in docking against GSK3\u03b2, CDK1, and CDK2. All 15 ligands showed nearly identical GlideScore for GSK3\u03b2, CDK1 and CDK2, suggesting a high affinity of these ligands to the CDKs active site as well (Table 2 ). In comparison, the evaluation of Glide-Scores of the ligands derived from our approach indicated a greater selectivity towards GSK3\u03b2 (Table 1) .\n\nMany marvelous biological functions of proteins and their profound dynamic mechanisms can be revealed by studying their internal motions [55] [56] [57] [58] . Likewise, to accurately identify the ligand-binding pocket [59] and to really understand the interaction of a protein receptor with its ligand, we should consider not only the static structures concerned but also the dynamical information obtained by simulating their internal motions or dynamic process [59] [60] [61] [62] . We will make further efforts in this regard in our future study.\n\nMounting evidence implicate that GSK3\u03b2 plays an important role in the onset of many grievous human diseases. Recent data have further illustrated the contribution of Gsk3\u03b2 activity to apoptosis, suggesting that the design and development of selective small molecule inhibitors of Gsk3\u03b2 may be a good therapeutic option in the treatment of numerous human diseases, associated with apoptosis.\n\nIn this study, a new protocol for selective lead identification for Gsk3\u03b2 has been proposed. The protocol combines both ligand and structure-based approaches. A highly Nearly identical docking scores of the ligands for all three proteins (Gsk3\u03b2, CDK1 and CDK2) indicate their equal affinity towards the target proteins In pharmacophore studies, the spatial alignment of the compounds is usually one of the key steps to obtain meaningful result. Figure 7 shows the good alignment of docked ligands with the pharmacophore. The pharmacophore model was further used to screen potential compounds from the zinc database. The VS process fetched 1,206 ligands as hits, which were further filtered by docking analysis. Finally, four hits obtained after docking procedure demonstrated better docking score, Glide energy and greater selectivity towards Gsk3\u03b2.\n\nIn conclusion, unifying the pharmacophore modeling, screening, molecular docking, and manual interpretation approach altogether, we have developed a new methodology to identify selective inhibitors for Gsk3\u03b2 (Fig. 1) . Further, we have delineated the important interactions responsible for binding and selectivity of ligands to the active site more effectively. This protocol may be useful for the identification of specific lead molecules for other potential drug targets as well."}
