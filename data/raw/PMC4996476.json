{"title": "National Library of Medicine Disaster Information Management Research Center: Achieving the vision, 2010\u20132013", "body": "This paper reviews the 2010\u20132013 progress of the Disaster Information Management Research Center (DIMRC) toward achieving the vision of its establishment at the National Library of Medicine (NLM). It builds on a 2013 paper [22] that describes the establishment and early years of DIMRC in 2008\u20132010 and reviews NLM disaster-related activities prior to 2008.\n\nBased on the recommendations in Charting a Course for the 21st Century: NLM\u2019s Long Range Plan 2006\u20132016 [6], NLM has made significant progress in establishing the Disaster Information Management Research Center. In just a few years, DIMRC has developed, enhanced, and maintained several key resources and tools; created NLM\u2019s first mobile applications; experimented with health information technology for hospital disaster response; and developed key collaborations with a number of agencies and organizations.\n\nDIMRC activities and current initiatives include:\n\nThis paper explores each of these areas of interest and also includes guidance provided by an advisory group established by the NLM Board of Regents and by the DIMRC strategic plan (2012\u20132015).\n\nNLM, one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has played a pivotal role in translating biomedical research into practice since 1836. NLM, with more than 20 million books, journals, manuscripts, audiovisuals and other forms of medical information, is available to people worldwide via Web resources such as PubMed [42] and PubMed Central [43] references and full-text journal literature for professionals, and MedlinePlus [25] health information for the public. As a research institute, NLM also includes performing and funding biomedical informatics research as a major function.\n\nNLM has long provided health information, training, and tools in response to disasters. The NLM commitment to providing disaster health information pre-dates the creation of the Disaster Information Management Research Center by several decades and is documented in a 2013 paper [22] on the Center\u2019s \u201cEstablishment and Growth, 2008\u20132010\u201d. Pre-2008 efforts included the development of WISER (Wireless Information System for Emergency Responders) [55], REMM (Radiation Emergency Medical Management) [45], and the Influenza Virus Resource [21]; assistance for Hurricane Katrina-affected medical libraries; disaster-related informatics research grants; and the formation of the Central American Network for Disaster and Health Information (CANDHI, now known as LANDHI or RELACIGER) [44]. NLM encourages greater recognition of information management and access to health information resources as key components of disaster medicine and public health.\n\nAs it has for more than 175 years, NLM collects and disseminates medical information through both its comprehensive online resources and its print, audiovisual, and historical collections. For example, on disaster-related topics:\n\nDIMRC is guided by outside advisors and internal strategic plans. The NLM Board of Regents, the Library\u2019s advisory board [29], established an ad hoc Working Group on the Disaster Information Management Research Center in 2010. The Group, chaired by Robert Windom, M.D., met once in 2011 and once in 2012. The all-day meetings had wide ranging discussions that included NLM staff presentations on past and current DIMRC initiatives. Group members, from multiple disciplines and all with disaster experience, are listed in Appendix A.\n\nThe Board of Regents posed the following questions in its charge to the Working Group:\n\nThe Group\u2019s guidance is highlighted in the sections below on \u201cFuture Considerations\u201d and in a final report. In response to the Group\u2019s guidance, DIMRC staff conducted planning sessions in late 2011 and 2013 to develop and update a strategic plan (described above) for 2012\u20132014.\n\nBased on the recommendations of the DIMRC Working Group and strategic plan, DIMRC will continue to work in the following areas to promote roles for librarians, information specialists and libraries:\n\nDIMRC will continue to be proactive in demonstrating the value of Disaster Information Specialists, and extend training beyond medical librarians to other librarians and to the disaster workforce (perhaps through the FEMA Emergency Management Institute Independent Study Program [19] or training resources like Pacific EMPRINTS [39]). DIMRC will consider adding a practicum component to the training program. Disaster Information Specialists should become increasingly proactive in assisting disaster/emergency personnel through education/training and knowledge management. Suggested routes for promotion include attending conferences and publishing articles and editorials about the Disaster Information Specialist concept in both library journals and journals that reach an emergency/disaster workforce audience. Areas to explore are marketing the Specialist concept to public health departments and policymakers, and suggesting that librarians support Emergency Operations Centers; assisting public health departments and emergency shelters with information for responders, shelter operators, and the public; collaborating with local health and hospital hotlines during a crisis; and working with poison control centers and local disaster voluntary organizations.\n\nDIMRC, with support from the Working Group, is investigating how social media can be used in disaster management. DIMRC will work with other agencies to investigate how to evaluate the use of social media for disaster preparedness and response in order to understand user information-seeking behaviors. Librarians should use and promote relevant technologies to increase community resiliency.\n\nBased on the recommendations of the DIMRC Working Group and strategic plan, DIMRC will continue to work in the following areas to ensure access to the disaster medicine and public health literature:\n\nSome Working Group members were concerned about the inconsistent and poorly-defined terminology used in the published research literature on disaster medicine, especially its use by those involved only sporadically in disaster response. Although this is an issue best addressed by journal editors and researchers, NLM supported the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine (WADEM) initial investigation of ways to develop a common disaster medicine research vocabulary. NLM also identified over 60 existing English-language glossaries, dictionaries, and controlled vocabularies in this field [7].\n\nBased on the recommendations of the DIMRC Working Group and strategic plan, DIMRC will continue to work in the following areas to ensure the availability of authoritative, timely resources for the disaster workforce:\n\nThe Working Group was especially interested in identifying gaps in available resources and healthcare provider knowledge of disaster medicine, and tailoring tools to address those needs. It recommended considering the use of federated search tools to identify content from multiple sources, ways to display retrieval, and methods to get feedback from users on DIMRC resources.\n\nThe Working Group suggested creating syntheses of available information through the use of new concepts for authoring that allow for multiple contributors, continuous updating, and a level of peer review. Social media, particularly the Wikipedia and crowd-sourcing models, may be promising approaches. DIMRC will consider investigating these tools to enhance resources and encourage interaction and collaboration among the disaster workforce.\n\nBased on the recommendations of the DIMRC Working Group and strategic plan, DIMRC will continue to work in the following area to ensure the development and effective use of health information technology to enhance disaster preparedness, response, and recovery:\n\nNLM will consider expanding efforts to determine how the latest information technology tools may assist other hospitals or organizations involved in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery. NLM will also ensure that existing tools are adapted to current technologies used by the disaster community.\n\nBased on the recommendations of the DIMRC Working Group and strategic plan, DIMRC will continue to work in the following areas to ensure continued progress in outreach efforts and partnerships:\n\nDIMRC will continue developing partnerships and look to new agencies and organizations. In addition to the agencies listed above, the Working Group suggested working with FEMA, the Public Health Service, University of Pittsburgh Supercourse [49], private and public sector agencies responsible for water quality and other environmental issues, the military\u2019s National Center for Telehealth and Technology [27], and professional associations and public health organizations such as the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) and the National Association of City and County Health Officials (NACCHO).\n\nNLM will continue to explore ways to teach the medical and public health workforce about disaster-related information resources, as recommended by the Working Group. In addition, DIMRC will explore outreach to the library community beyond the medical librarians via the American Library Association and the Special Libraries Association.\n\nThe Working Group recommended that NLM continue to work with the National Center for Disaster Medicine and Public Health at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, and the AMA Center for Public Health Preparedness and Disaster Response (whose efforts are now being continued by the Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health [47]) on the development of core competencies and curricula for the wide variety of health professionals involved regularly or ad hoc in disasters. DIMRC especially advocates for the inclusion of competencies that address disaster health information literacy [54] for medical and public health professionals and also compiles the many core competencies that have been published for health disciplines [13]. NLM, as it does for all medical disciplines, identifies and disseminates outcomes-based and evidence-based research in disaster medicine.\n\nAlthough DIMRC has no officially assigned disaster response duties within the National Response Framework, the Center is responsive to the many major regional, national, and international incidents that arise. Following an incident, DIMRC provides timely, authoritative health information for use in affected communities; encourages local librarian participation in response efforts; and exploits teachable moments to further prepare librarians in unaffected regions. DIMRC especially focuses on unfamiliar topics and rare occurrences such as massive oil spills, radiation incidents, or incidents that cause illness or injuries not encountered in routine medical practice. The NN/LM Regional Medical Libraries are invaluable partners in disseminating information about disaster health issues when a disaster strikes in their regions. They also reach out to librarians affected by a disaster and to libraries experiencing major service disruptions.\n\nThe Center responded to the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill; the 2010 Haiti earthquake and cholera outbreak; the 2011 Japan earthquake, tsunami, and radiation incident; interest in novel viruses (H7N9, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus [MERS-CoV]); drought conditions in North America; major U.S. wildfires and tornadoes; school and workplace mass shootings; Hurricane Sandy (2012); and, in 2013, Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the West, TX fertilizer facility explosion, and the Boston Marathon bombing. Depending on the incident, DIMRC response may include wide dissemination of health information to responders and librarians through Twitter, the DISASTR-OUTREACH-LIB list-serv, webinars, and Web guides or topic pages pointing to incident-specific online resources. A hands-on approach was taken by a senior computer scientist from DIMRC asked by PAHO to help create a local emergency operations center in Port-au-Prince and organize information about the activities of the nearly 100 agencies providing health care in Haiti during the cholera epidemic. DIMRC coordinates with other federal agencies to provide government-wide consistent, authoritative health information relevant to each incident. Announcements of activation of the Emergency Access Initiative (for free access to books, journals, and databases) are widely distributed. DIMRC staff monitor public news sources and HHS Secretary\u2019s Operations Center reports and response activities to maintain awareness of public health issues stemming from an incident.\n\nIn the aftermath of specific disasters, NLM is the only library that is proactive in national distribution of relevant health information through pre-established channels. Federal agencies that also provide health information in response to an incident (including CDC, FDA, ASPR, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Energy) almost always concentrate on their own resources and do not aggregate the information from all appropriate sources for the primary benefit of health workers. DIMRC is unique in aggregating health information from a wide range of sources and in providing ready access (preformatted searches) to relevant materials from PubMed, Disaster Lit, TOXNET, and other NLM databases at the time of a disaster.\n\nAs an example of incident response by DIMRC and NN/LM Regional Medical Libraries, the following efforts were undertaken immediately after and in the months following Hurricane (Superstorm) Sandy on October 29, 2012:\n\nOf course, as in any incident, it is the local response that has an impact on those directly affected. The local libraries and librarians in the affected areas of New Jersey and New York played many creative and generous roles in their local communities. Some of these libraries were damaged or destroyed by the hurricane or surrounded by community devastation. DIMRC and the NN/LM played a very modest supporting role compared to those on the frontlines. The local school, public, and hospital libraries\u2019 efforts are well documented and were greatly appreciated. Examples of their contributions can be found in the Librarians and Libraries Respond to Disasters bibliography as well as in photos, [33] media reports, video [37], libraries\u2019 blogs and newsletters, and efforts to collect the stories of those impacted by the storm [5].\n\nDIMRC\u2019s mission is To develop and provide access to health information resources and technology for disaster preparedness, response, and recovery by connecting people to quality disaster health information and fostering a culture of community resiliency.\n\nBased on the recommendations in Charting a Course for the 21st Century: NLM\u2019s Long Range Plan 2006\u20132016, NLM has made significant progress in establishing the Disaster Information Management Research Center. In just a few years, DIMRC has developed, enhanced, and maintained several key resources and tools; created NLM\u2019s first mobile applications; experimented with health information technology for hospital disaster response; and developed key collaborations with a number of agencies and organizations.\n\nDIMRC aims to assist other government agencies in providing information in a coordinated, just-what-I-need, just-in-time fashion, and does not seek to duplicate efforts assigned to other agencies. The focus of these agencies is on the creation of the material, whether it is writing and updating guidelines in response to an emerging disease, such as H1N1 (CDC); announcing the authorization of a drug for emergency use in a public health emergency (FDA); or providing critical medical treatment information in response to a chemical spill, radiation leak or improvised nuclear device. NLM has the expertise to provide assistance in organizing this information and making all related information easier to find; and to develop innovative tools for locating and presenting the information.\n\nNLM has an excellent reputation in the medical community for developing high-quality, authoritative health information resources. With the formation of DIMRC, NLM has continued to demonstrate its skill in providing a wealth of resources to serve multiple needs and users. DIMRC is a new organization that has good results in reaching and informing a wide variety of emergency/disaster preparedness personnel including firefighters and EMTs, emergency managers, and public health specialists. Outreach to these disparate groups will require constant attention by DIMRC staff and others involved in health information outreach such as staff and members of the National Network of Libraries of Medicine. DIMRC also will need to expand and explore its use of new technologies for communication, promotion, and community engagement, such as social media. DIMRC\u2019s Twitter account has 2,500 followers and has been at the forefront of NLM\u2019s efforts to engage with our followers and related organizations and not use social media solely as a self-promotion tool.\n\nOver the past several years, DIMRC has collaborated with a number of agencies and organizations, including ASPR, NIH (NCI, NICHD, NIEHS, Clinical Center), FDA and DOT. DIMRC worked with these agencies to develop databases, Web resources, and mobile apps. These collaborations show good cooperation among government agencies to decrease duplication and enhance easy access to critical information. However, DIMRC\u2019s expertise in the development of health IT tools and complex information management is not widely known in the disaster management community. DIMRC will need to engage with other developers and emergency/disaster personnel (DHS Science and Technology Directorate and FEMA; state and local public health and emergency management agencies) to demonstrate existing tools and ways in which NLM staff (librarians, computer scientists, and subject matter experts) can assist in the research and development of new tools to aid in disaster preparedness and response.\n\nCommunity resiliency is the goal of Presidential Policy Directive-8. Libraries and librarians are at the heart of communities and are seen as trusted sources of information, safe environments for learning, and \u201cessential community services\u201d. NLM is the leader in defining roles for librarians to assist in all phases of disasters, and training librarians in the available tools and resources to assist disaster personnel in their communities, as well as in ensuring continuity of operations at libraries themselves. To gain and retain a \u201cseat at the table\u201d (meaning working closely with emergency management staff and decision-makers), DIMRC will need to expand the Disaster Information Specialist concept and promote the varied and technically sophisticated tools and resources it has developed, as well as demonstrate its willingness to listen, learn, assist, and participate in activities related to enhancing community resiliency."}
