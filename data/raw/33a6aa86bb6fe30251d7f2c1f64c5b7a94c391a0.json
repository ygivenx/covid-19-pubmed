To date (Mar 5, 2020), there have been 95,333 confirmed cases worldwide and 3282 deaths 1 . COVID-19 poses a major threat to global health and was declared a 'public health emergency of international concern' by the WHO on 30 Jan 2020 2 .\n\n.

It is important to gain a clear picture of risk factors associated with this new viral respiratory infection in order to allocate appropriate medical resources to prevent the development of severe or critical forms of COVID-19 in those considered to be at higher risk. Here, we consider the possibility that infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the pathogen that causes tuberculosis (TB), the top cause of death due to an infectious disease, may predispose to SARS-CoV infection and the more rapid development of symptoms and severe COVID-19 pneumonia.

These studies were approved by the Ethics Committee of Shenyang Chest Hospital, and informed written consent was obtained from each of the study participants.\n\nThroat swabs, blood and sputum were collected from suspected COVID-19 patients and sent for SARS-CoV-2 testing using a real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay 6,7 at the Shenyang Disease Control Center.\n\nIFN-\uf067 IGRA assays IFN-\uf067 IGRA assays were performed using X.DOT-TB kits (TB Healthcare, Foshan, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions 8 .\n\nAnalyses were performed using R (version 3.6.1). The normality of data distributions was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Normally-distributed data are presented as means (SD), while non-normally distributed data are presented as medians (IQR), and categorical variables as frequencies (%). Differences between groups were analysed by Fisher's exact test or Pearson's chisquared test (for categorical data), and Students' t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests (for continuous data).\n\nAmong the 36 confirmed COVID-19 patients from Shenyang, Liaoning province, China, included in this study, the most common symptoms at presentation were cough (61.11%), dyspnea (33.33%), .

The mean age of patients was 47 years (range: 25-79), and 18 were men. Fifteen cases had a connection with Wuhan/Hubei province or neighboring cities, while 21 had become infected via local transmission (3), or from friends/family members in Shenyang already diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nTo evaluate the implications of MTB infection history on the incidence and progression of COVID-19 disease, we addressed three questions. Does MTB co-infection: 1. increase susceptibility to SARS-COV-19 infection; 2. increase disease severity; and 3. lead to more rapid disease progression? We first assigned cases into two groups based on the severity of their COVID-19 pneumonia according to the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines of the National Health Commission of China (v6) 9 . Twenty-seven cases were mild/moderate (75%, Group 1) and nine cases were severe/critical (25%, Group 2) ( Table 2) . We then determined the MTB infection status of each patient by examining their clinical history and by performing X.DOT-TB IGRA assays (Table 1) To determine if MTB infection is a risk factor specific for COVID-19 pneumonia, or for pneumonia in general, we compared the MTB infection rate within these COVID-19 cases with data from a case-series comprised of 115 bacterial pneumonia and 62 viral pneumonia patients obtained from another study conducted in Shenyang (unpublished) ( Figure 1A ); MTB infection rates were considerably higher among COVID-19 patients than among bacterial pneumonia patients (36.11% vs 20%; p = 0.047 Figure 1A ) and viral pneumonia patients (36.11% vs 16.13%; p = 0.024),\n\nsuggesting that MTB infection status is a specific risk factor for SARS-COV-2 infection rather than for pneumonia in general.

The percentage of patients with MTB infection was also considerably higher than the percentage of patients with other co-morbidities (diabetes: 25%; hypertension: 22.2%; coronary heart disease: 8.33%; COPD: 5.56%; Table 1 ), suggesting MTB infection represents a higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nWith respect to disease severity, the percentage of severe/critical cases with MTB coinfection was significantly higher than that in the mild/moderate group (78% vs 22%; p = 0.0049; Figure 1B ). Seven of the 9 severe/critical cases were IGRA+ve indicating MTB co-infection, and of these, 4 of the 5 cases that developed ARDS were IGRA+ve. By comparison, 21 of 27 cases (78%) in Group 1 (mild/moderate cases) were IGRA-ve and had no history of TB disease. This data infers that coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 with MTB tends to lead to the development of more severe or critical COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nOur data also show that MTB infection is associated with more rapid development of symptoms ( Figure 1C-D) ; MTB coinfected COVID-19 cases developed symptoms on average 3.3 days earlier than their non-MTB-infected counterparts. Development of critical symptoms is reported to occur on average 9 days after initial symptom onset 4 . The 7 MTB-infected severe/critical COVID-19 cases here, however, were categorized as severe/critical 3.4 days after initial symptom development. While the number of cases here is not sufficient to draw a solid conclusion, it would appear that COVID-19 disease progresses more rapidly in the presence of MTB coinfection.\n\nThis observational study of the relationship between MTB infection and COVID-19 pneumonia suggests that individuals with latent or active TB may be more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and that COVID-19 disease progression may be more rapid and severe. Given that TB causes more deaths than any other infectious disease (1.45 million deaths and 10 million new cases .

It is perhaps not surprising that chronic respiratory diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and indeed active TB, could predispose susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Statistics from other reported studies, however, suggest that the frequency of these co-morbidities is much lower than that of MTB infection in this study (COPD: 1% of 1099 COVID-19 cases 12 , chronic respiratory disease: 2.4% of 72,314 COVID-19 cases 13 ). The strength of this finding, however, is limited by the relatively low number of cases involved in this study and requires further validation.\n\nBased on our findings, we make the following recommendations for the management and treatment of patients with a history of MTB infection (LTBI or active TB) and possible SARS-CoV-2 coinfection. First, the medical and wider community should be informed that latent/active TB is a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and those at risk should be encouraged to pay special attention to preventive measures. Ideally, this vulnerable group should be monitored regularly at community-based medical centers in situations when resources are available. Second, the MTB infection status (history and IGRA response) of suspected/confirmed COVID-19 cases should be checked routinely on admission to ensure coinfected cases are placed in appropriate isolation wards if active TB is detected. Third, special medical resources (such as ECMO therapy) should be arranged in advance for coinfected patients in view of the increased likelihood of rapid development of severe or critical symptoms. Fourth, therapeutic approaches for cases known to be coinfected both SARS-CoV-2 and MTB should bear their MTB infection history in mind; for example, treatments involving immunosuppressive agents should be reconsidered, as they hold the potential to reactivate latent TB infections. .
