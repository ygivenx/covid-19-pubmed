{"title": "Complete Genome Sequence of a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus from Kenyan Bats", "body": "order: 5= UTR-ORF1ab-S-ORF3a-E-M-ORF6-ORF7a-ORF7b-N-3= UTR. Unlike SARS-CoV and other known SARS-CoV-related bat viruses, both ORF3b and ORF8 were absent in BtKY72. ORF8 was also missing in its closest neighbor, BtCoV/BM48-31 (15) .\n\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates that the SARS-related CoVs that were identified from Rhinolophus bats in China and Europe were also present in Kenyan Rhinolophus bats (Fig. 1) . The discovery of SARS-related CoVs in Kenyan bats adds to the diversity and geographic range of CoVs in Rhinolophus bats. The genome data for BtKY72 will facilitate understanding of the molecular evolutionary characteristics of bat SARS-related CoV.\n\nData availability. The complete genome sequence of BtKY72 is available in Gen-Bank under the accession number KY352407.\n\nWe and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA, and Bernard Agwanda from the National Museum, Kenya Wildlife Service, Nairobi, Kenya, for excellent technical and logistical assistance and field study.\n\nThe findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."}
