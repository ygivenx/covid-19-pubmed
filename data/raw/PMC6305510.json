{"title": "Immunohistochemical studies on meningoencephalitis in feline infectious\nperitonitis (FIP)", "body": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a widely distributed infectious disease caused by\nfeline coronavirus (FCoV) in domestic and wild cat species [1, 2, 11, 13]. FCoV consists of two biotypes\nincluding feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and FIP virus (FIPV). FECV infection is\nasymptomatic or exclusively causes mild gastrointestinal clinical symptons, while FIPV causes\nfatal symptoms such as fever, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal distention and neurological\nsymptoms in young cats [2, 13]. The clinical symptoms differ depending on the form and organ\ndistribution of the lesion, and in cases with lesions in central nervous system, neurological\nsymptoms such as depression, ataxia and seizures appear in 85% of cases [15]. It was assumed that FIPV originating from FECV acquired its monocyte-\nor macrophage- tropism responsible for viral dissemination and developed specific FIP lesions\ndue to vasculitis [17, 18].\n\nThe FIP lesions are characterized by localized or disseminated fibrinous, pyogranulomatous,\nor granulomatous inflammation with protein-rich effusion in the body cavities [9, 10]. These lesions\nare often accompanied with granulomatous or necrotizing phlebitis and/or periphlebitis, which\nhave been considered as a typical hallmark of FIP [3,\n10]. Lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) are\nfrequently observed mainly in the leptomeninges, ventricles, choroid plexus and sometimes\nneuroparenchyma [5, 12, 16]. Although histopathological features\nof FIP lesions in the CNS have been well documented [6,\n14, 15], the\nassociation between inflammatory cell types and the distribution of viral antigens remains to\nbe clarified. The present study describes the inflammatory cell types and viral antigen\ndistribution in the brain lesions of 4 cats diagnosed as FIP. Also, considering that the FIPV\nhas monocyte and macrophage tropism, immunohistochemical examinations were performed using two\nkinds of macrophage markers: CD204 (monocyte and macrophage marker) and Iba-1 (microglia and\nmacrophage marker).\n\nFour necropsy cases of cats diagnosed as FIP were obtained from the specimen archives of the\nLaboratory of Veterinary Pathology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, the\nUniversity of Tokyo. Diagnoses of FIP were mainly based on clinical history, physical\nexamination findings, general blood chemistry and antibody titer for FCoV antigen. Final\ndiagnoses were based on gross findings at necropsy and histopathological findings. Information\nof the 4 cases, including age, sex, major clinical signs, the antibody titer of FCoV and\norgans with histologically severe inflammatory lesions is summarized in Table 1. The cats died at the age of 6 months (Case Nos. 3 and 4), 8 months (Case No. 2)\nand 7 years (Case No. 1), respectively. The main neurological sign was ataxia (Case Nos. 1 and\n4). Three cats (Case Nos. 2, 3 and 4) had fluid accumulation in the peritoneal and pleural\ncavities (effusive FIP). In Case No. 1, there was no fluid accumulation in the peritoneal and\npleural cavities (non-effusive FIP). For case Nos. 3 and 4, the antibody titer of FCoV was\nelevated (FIP: >100).\n\nAll tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin, routinely processed and embedded in\nparaffin wax. Tissue sections of 4 \u00b5m-thick were stained with hematoxylin and\neosin (HE). Selected brain sections were subjected to immunohistochemical examinations. Normal\nfeline brain tissue was also stained as a control. Deparaffinized and rehydrated sections were\ntreated through the antigen retrieval methods listed in Table 2. After being immersed in 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol at room temperature\nfor 5 min, the sections were treated with 8% skim milk at 37\u00b0C for 40 min. The sections were\nthen incubated with the primary antibodies listed in Table 2 at 4\u00b0C overnight, and then incubated with the Dako EnVision + System\nhorseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labelled anti-rabbit (Dako-Japan, Tokyo, Japan) or anti-mouse\nsecondary antibodies (Dako-Japan) at 37\u00b0C for 40 min. The antigen-antibody reaction was\nvisualized with 0.05% 3.3\u2032-diaminobenzidine and 0.03% hydrogen peroxide in tris-hydrochloric\nbuffer. Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin.\n\nInflammatory changes were observed in the brain and spinal cord of all the 4 cases. They were\nlocated in the leptomeninges (Fig. 1a), choroid plexus (Fig. 1c) and subventricular\narea (Fig. 1e) of the lateral, third and fourth\nventricles (Table 3). These inflammatory lesions were characterized by perivascular accumulations of\ninflammatory cells, and the inflammatory cells consisted of macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma\ncells and neutrophils. Some macrophages showed an epithelioid cell morphology, forming\ngranulomatous lesions. In all cases there were no notable neuronal degeneration or glial\nnodules in the brain parenchyma.\n\nIn the three cases (Case Nos. 1 to 3), viral antigens were detected within the inflammatory\nfoci but not in the brain parenchymal cells including neurons and glial cells (Figs. 1b, 1d and 1f). On the other hand, in case No. 4,\nviral antigens were observed neither in the inflammatory foci nor brain parenchyma (Table 3). Further differently, in three of the 4 cases\n(Case Nos. 1 to 3), brain parenchymal lesions were not evident, while in case No. 4, glial\nfibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive gemistcytic astrocytes proliferated diffusely in the\nsubventricular parenchyma adjacent to severe inflammatory lesions (Fig. 2a and 2b).\n\nIn Case Nos. 1 (Fig. 3a\u2013f), 2 and 3, viral antigens (Fig. 3b) were\nscattered within the perivascular area where a large number of Iba1- and CD204-positive\nmacrophages accumulated (Fig. 3c and 3d). Besides, a\nmoderate number of CD20-positive B lymphocytes accumulated around the glia limitans adjacent\nto the inflammatory foci (Fig. 3e). A few\nCD3-positive T lymphocytes were diffusely observed in the foci (Fig. 3f). Neutrophils were observed in various degrees.\n\nIn contrast, in case No. 4, Iba1- and CD204-positive macrophages were sparsely scattered in\nthe inflammatory foci (Fig. 4a, 4c and 4d) without a distinct granuloma formation. No FIPV antigens were detected in the foci\n(Fig. 4b). A large number of CD20-positive B\nlymphocytes accumulated mainly in the perivascular areas (Fig. 4e). The distribution pattern of CD3-positive T lymphocytes was similar to\nthose of the other three cases (Fig. 4f).\nNeutrophils were observed in various degrees.\n\nIn addition to brain lesions, severe inflammatory lesions were observed in the lung (Case\nNos. 1 to 3), liver (Case Nos. 1 and 2), pancreas (Case No. 4), spleen (Case No. 2),\nkidney (Case Nos. 1 and 3), adrenal glands (Case No. 1) and eyes (Case No. 3) (Table 1). The type of inflammatory\ncells in each organ were similar to the brain. Inflammation was also found in adipose tissue\nand serosa of the thoracic and abdominal organs for Case Nos. 2 and 3, and of the abdominal\norgans for Case No. 4.\n\nIn the present study, all the 4 cases examined were diagnosed as FIP based on the clinical\nand pathologic findings. Viral antigens were detected in macrophages around vessels of the\nlesions in the leptomeninges and subventricles of Case Nos. 1 to 3. These findings were in\nconformity with those in a recent report on FIP meningoencephalitis [15]. On the other hand, viral antigen was not detected in the brain of Case\nNo. 4, though the cat was clinically diagnosed as FIP because of neurological symptoms and\nelevated antibody titer of FCoV.\n\nPathological diagnosis of FIP is mainly performed by immunofluorescence (IF) using fresh\ntissues or immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed paraffin sections [7]. Immunohistochemistry was believed to be more specific than IF [15], while some previous reports also raised questions\nabout its specificity [4]. The antibody used in this\nstudy, FIPV3-70, is known to react with the nucleocapsid antigen of FIPV and is considered a\nvaluable diagnostic tool for FIP [8]. However, a\nprevious paper demonstrated antigenic heterogeneity in FIPV nucleocapsid proteins [14]. Thus, it is possible that the difference in FIPV\nantigen type cause the lack of viral antigen in lesions of Case No. 4.\n\nFor the constitution of inflammatory cells in the lesion, CD204- and/or Iba1-positive\nmacrophages, CD20-positive B cells, CD3-positive T lymphocytes and neutrophils were detected\nin all 4 cases with various severities.\n\nIn three cases (Case Nos. 1 to 3), the majority of inflammatory cells was CD204- and/or\nIba1-positive macrophages and a moderate number of CD20-positive B lymphocytes accumulated\naround the glia limitans adjacent to the inflammatory foci. On the contrary, in Case No. 4,\nthe majority of the inflammatory cells was CD20-positive B lymphocytes and moderate to severe\ndiffuse GFAP-positive astrogliosis in the subventricular lesions was also observed adjacent to\ninflammatory foci. Similar astrocytic response together with microglial reaction have been\nreported also in previous FIP cases [12].\n\nIn a previous study on FIP, it was reported that viral antigens were detected in macrophage\ndominant lesions, and B lymphocytes and plasma cells which were positive for\ncoronavirus-specific antibodies were observed as bands around or the basal side of the lesion.\nOn the other hand, viral antigens were rarely detected in B lymphocytes and plasma cells\ndominant lesions. B lymphocytes and plasma cells are considered to induce FIP virus-specific\nimmune responses and be replaced by macrophages [8,\n9].\n\nTherefore, in the present study, the lesion of Case No.4 with abundant CD20-positive B\nlymphocytes and GFAP-positive astrocytes was considered to be a subacute to chronic stage\nlesion of FIP that lacked active virus replication."}
