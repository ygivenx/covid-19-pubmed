{"title": "Inhibition of canonical WNT signaling attenuates human leiomyoma cell growth", "body": "Uterine leiomyomas, the most common pelvic tumor in women, are benign smooth muscle tumors originating from the myometrium (1) . Uterine leiomyomas occur in approximately 70% of Caucasian women and more than 80% of African-American women by age 50 and cause excessive uterine bleeding, anemia, recurrent pregnancy loss, preterm labor, pelvic discomfort and urinary incontinence in approximately 15-30% of cases (2) (3) (4) . Recently, it has been reported that ulipristal acetate controlled excessive bleeding due to leiomyoma and reduced the size of the tumor preoperatively (5) . Ulipristal acetate is non-inferior to once monthly leuprolide acetate in controlling uterine bleeding and is significantly less likely to cause hot flashes (6) . However, leiomyomas are still the most common indication for hysterectomy (3, (7) (8) (9) . Approximately 200,000 hysterectomies, 30,000 myomectomies, and thousands of selective uterine-artery embolizations and high-intensity focused ultrasound procedures are performed annually in the United States to remove or destroy uterine leiomyoma. The annual economic burden of these tumors is estimated to be between $5.9 billion and $34.4 billion (8, 10) . Thus, there is a need to discover new treatment modalities.\n\nSelective overexpression of constitutively activated \u03b2-catenin in uterine mesenchyme during embryonic development and in adults gives rise to leiomyoma-like tumors in the uterus of all female mice, suggesting that signaling by WNT/\u03b2-catenin seems to play a role in somatic stem cell function in the myometrium and uterine leiomyoma tissue (11) . WNT signaling through its Frizzled (Fzd) receptor leads to stabilization of cytosolic \u03b2-catenin and its translocation to the nucleus, which results in the activation of the transcription factor T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) (12) (13) . In the absence of pathway stimulation, a complex consisting of Axin, GSK-3, and Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) promotes \u03b2catenin phosphorylation and subsequent proteolytic degradation.\n\nWNT signaling is important for embryonic development and is also active in stem cells (12, (14) (15) . Dysregulation of WNT signaling is a common denominator in a variety of tumors (16) (17) (18) , and WNT-activating mutations are present in many cancers including colon cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and ovarian endometrioid cancer (16) . WNT ligands or inhibitors have been shown to affect the growth and survival of colon cancer cells (19) (20) (21) , suggesting that targeting WNT pathway receptors may be a more feasible therapeutic approach than interfering with downstream protein-protein interactions.\n\nIndeed, blocking canonical WNT activity in colorectal and other WNT-deregulated cancers causes cell-cycle arrest in the G 1 phase, leading to tumor cell growth inhibition e.\n\nIt is well established that WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling can promote cell proliferation, particularly in epithelial-derived cancers and stem cell populations (22) (23) (24) , but whether or not \u03b2-catenin signaling drove smooth muscle cell proliferation through activation of similar gene targets as epithelial cells was unclear. Recently, it was reported that lung fibroblasts proliferated under the control of \u03b2-catenin signaling (25) (26) . In recent years, several classes of small molecules have been shown to act as WNT inhibitors, which exert their inhibitory effects at various levels of the WNT signaling pathway (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) . Three small molecules-Inhibitor of \u03b2-Catenin And TCF4 (ICAT), niclosamide, and XAV939-have been shown to strongly and specifically reduce levels of active \u03b2-catenin in vitro by inhibiting \u03b2-catenin stabilization and downstream \u03b2-catenin signaling (TCF/LEF reporter activity). In this study, we hypothesized that these molecules also inhibit WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling to reduce the growth and proliferation of human leiomyoma cells. We tested the effects of these molecules on primary cultures of leiomyoma cells from women undergoing hysterectomy or myomectomy for leiomyoma, with the goal of establishing the antitumor properties of these molecules as potential candidates for further development.\n\nLeiomyoma samples were obtained from surgeries from 38 women (range 27-53 years) undergoing hysterectomy or myomectomy. We used leiomyomas derived from patients without receiving hormonal treatment. De-identified patient information was collected including age, weight, height, race, day of last menstrual cycle, parity, and use of oral contraceptives. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient and the use of human tissue was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Research at Northwestern University, Chicago, IL. None of the women had a previous history of uterine cancer, and all samples were confirmed by histopathological examination to be free of malignancy.\n\nWe isolated leiomyoma cells using a technique that was previously described (33) (34) . We used \u03b1-smooth muscle actin protein expression and MED12 gene mutations as a marker for leiomyoma cells. Leiomyoma cells were cultured in 96-well flat-bottomed plates in DMEM/F12 1:1 (Life technologies, Grand Island, NY) containing 10% FBS and grown in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 at 37\u00b0C. Freshly cultured leiomyoma cells were treated with 30 mmol/L of NaCl (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for the baseline \u03b2-catenin condition or 30 mmol/L of LiCl (Sigma) to inhibit GSK-3\u03b2 activity, thereby activating \u03b2-catenin (35) . For cell proliferation assays, leiomyoma cells were incubated for 3 days with various concentrations of niclosamide (0.4, 2, or 10 \u03bcmol/L; Sigma) or XAV939 (0.1, 1, 10, or 20 \u03bcmol/L; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Reagents were diluted with DMSO (Sigma). Control cells were treated with DMSO.\n\nLeiomyoma cells were cultured in 96-well flat-bottom plates and infected with Ad-GFP and Ad-ICAT for 72 hours. The myc-ICAT cDNA was provided by Tetsu Akiyama (The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) and reengineered by Vector Biolabs (Philadelphia, PA) to encode a bicistronic mRNA that translates myc-ICAT and GFP proteins [Ad-ICAT (Myc)-Internal Ribosome Entry Site-GFP], and Ad-GFP viruses were used as a control for ICAT treatment and supplied by Tong Chuan He (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL). Infection efficiency of >90% was confirmed by visualizing GFP expression in living cells. Leiomyoma cells without adenoviral infection were used as controls.\n\nAfter viral transduction, cells were incubated for 3 days. Cell proliferation was measured by MTS assay. Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proliferation was measured as the optical density (OD) at 490 nm on a Synergy-HT plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT).\n\nLeiomyoma cell death was assayed as previously described in (36) . Lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured using a Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). OD 490 was read using a Synergy-HT plate reader and software (Bio-Tek Instruments).\n\nTotal RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit, (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized from 1 \u03bcg of RNA using qScript cDNA SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR of the WNT target genes AXIN2 (NM_004655) and Naked 1 (NKD1) (NM_033119) was performed using the ABI 7900HT (Life technologies) and Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Life technologies) for 40 cycles, with each cycle consisting of a 15-sec denaturation at 95.0\u00b0C, followed by 1 min of annealing at 60.0\u00b0C. The sizes of amplicons were 10 2 bp and 99 bp for AXIN2 and NKD1, respectively. The specificity of each PCR product was analyzed using the built-in melting curve analysis tool for each DNA product identified. For any sample, the expression level, normalized to the housekeeping gene encoding Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (NM_002046) GAPDH, was determined with the comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method.\n\nLeiomyoma cells were transfected with a TCF Optimal luciferase Promoter plasmid (TOPflash; containing 4 consensus TCF-binding sites upstream of a minimal c-fos promoter) or FOPflash (containing 4 mutant TCF-binding sites; kindly provided by H. Clevers, Utrecht, Netherlands), using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A thymidine kinase (TK)-Renilla plasmid (50 ng) was co-transfected to normalize luciferase values to transfection efficiency. Cells were treated with niclosamide or XAV939, with or without LiCl, 24 hours after transfection. Cells were solubilized 2 days after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI), and luciferase activity was quantified with a Synergy-HT plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). Firefly luciferase readings were first normalized to the reading for the corresponding Renilla luciferase reading to normalize for transfection efficiency. The adjusted TOPflash reading was then normalized to the corresponding adjusted FOPflash reading to account for background reading of the TOPflash construct.\n\nIndirect immunofluorescence staining was performed as described previously (33) (34) 37) . Background fluorescence was determined by applying the secondary conjugated antibody alone and by replacement of the primary antibody with non-immune serum. Slides were successively stained with \u03b2-catenin antibody (clone 14; 1:100; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), followed by incubation with secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 Dye (Molecular Probes Life Technologies). Images were collected using a confocal laser scanning system (LSM 510, Karl Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany).\n\nTo evaluate activation of canonical WNT signaling, intracellular levels of cadherin-free \u03b2catenin were determined by pull-down assays using glutathione S-transferase (GST)/ICAT, as previously described (38) . At the end of the treatment period, cells were harvested, solubilized in a nonionic detergent buffer (1% Nonidet P40 [NP40], 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM EDTA including protease inhibitors), and centrifuged at 14,000 \u00d7 g. Cellular \u03b2-catenin was affinity-precipitated using GST-ICAT immobilized to glutathionecoupled Sepharose (Sigma), washed with buffer A (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP40, and 10 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin), and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis using \u03b2catenin, ICAT (polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) and \u03b2-actin antibody (clone; AC-15, Sigma).\n\nEach experiment was repeated using cells from at least 3 subjects followed by statistical analysis. All of the data were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SD. P values were calculated using the Student's t test. Values of P < .05 were considered to be statistically significant.\n\nSince leiomyoma proliferation is thought to be a critical step in leiomyoma tumorigenesis, we addressed the contribution of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling to these phenotypes using cultures of human leiomyoma cells and adenoviruses (Ad-ICAT), which can inhibit WNT/\u03b2catenin signaling. Human leiomyoma cells were transduced with Ad-GFP or Ad-ICAT for 72 hours. After viral transduction, cells were incubated for 3 days. Cell proliferation was measured by MTS assay (n=3). Leiomyoma cells transduced with Ad-ICAT exhibited significantly lower proliferation compared to Ad-GFP transduced cells (Supplemental Fig.  1A) . The observed reduction in proliferation with ICAT overexpression was not due to diffuse cellular toxicity, as Ad-GFP or Ad-ICAT transduced leiomyoma cells showed no difference in LDH levels compared with the control group (No Tx; Supplemental Fig. 1B) .\n\nLeiomyoma cells (n=4) were treated with LiCl for 24 hours to induce \u03b2-catenin and transcription of WNT pathway target genes AXIN2 and NKD1 (Supplemental Fig. 1C and  D) . Subsequent adenoviral expression of ICAT significantly inhibited LiCl-stimulated AXIN2 and NKD1 gene expression, measured by real-time PCR. Ad-ICAT transduced cells without LiCl treatment had similar mRNA expression levels of AXIN2 and NKD1 to in Ad-GFP transduced cells.\n\nNiclosamide has been shown to inhibit Wnt pathway activation in colorectal cancer cells (39) (40) . Human leiomyoma cells (n=4) were treated with DMSO or increasing concentrations of niclosamide for 3 days prior to analysis by MTS assay. Niclosamide inhibited proliferation of leiomyoma cells in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 1A and B) . The observed reduction in proliferation after niclosamide treatment was not related to decreased cell survival, as LDH activity levels were similar for leiomyoma cells in all treatment groups (Fig. 1C) .\n\nActivation of the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway results in stimulation of the TCF/LEF transcription factor, which binds to TCF elements in the promoters of target genes (12) (13) . To analyze the effects of niclosamide on WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling in human leiomyoma cells, we transfected cells (n=6) with luciferase reporter constructs consisting of four copies of the TCF element (TOPflash), then treated the cells with increasing concentrations of niclosamide in the presence of LiCl. As expected, LiCl treatment (activates \u03b2-catenin) upregulated TOPflash reporter activity. This effect was blunted by treatment with increasing concentrations of niclosamide ( Fig. 2A) . Niclosamide treatment also down-regulated LiClinduced AXIN2 and NKD1 expression in human leiomyoma cells (n=4) (Fig. 2B) .\n\nActivation of the WNT signaling pathway results in the accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in the nucleus, followed by heterodimer formation with TCF and activation of TCF-dependent transcription (12) (13) . We examined the effects of niclosamide on subcellular localization of \u03b2-catenin in human leiomyoma cells (n=5) (Fig. 2C ). LiCl treatment induced nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin, whereas treatment with niclosamide blocked both baseline and LiCl-induced \u03b2-catenin nuclear translocation. We evaluated the amount of \u03b2-catenin in human leiomyoma cells (n=3) with GST-ICAT pull-down assays. As expected, \u03b2-catenin levels were significantly lower in niclosamide-treated leiomyoma cells compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 2D) .\n\nTankyrases 1 and 2 are proteins with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase activity. Tankyrases have been shown be involved in the WNT signaling pathway. Tankyrases bind directly to AXIN, a member of the \"destruction complex\" involved in \u03b2-catenin degradation. Inhibition of tankyrase stabilizes AXIN, increases the activity of the destruction complex and promotes degradation of \u03b2-catenin. XAV939 is a tankyrase inhibitor, thereby inhibiting WNT/\u03b2catenin signaling. Human leiomyoma cells (n=6) were treated with DMSO or increasing concentrations of XAV939 for 3 days prior to analysis by MTS assay. XAV939 inhibited the proliferation of leiomyoma cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A and B) . The reduced proliferation observed with XAV939 was not due to an effect on diffuse cell toxicity, because LDH activity levels were the same across treatment groups (Fig. 3C) .\n\nTo analyze the effect of XAV939 on WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling in human leiomyoma cells (n=6), we transfected cells with the TCF reporter constructs (TOPflash or FOPflash) and treated the cells with increasing concentrations of XAV939 in the presence of LiCl. XAV939 inhibited LiCl-induced TCF reporter activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.  4A ). XAV939 also downregulated LiCl-induced AXIN2 and NKD1 expression in human leiomyoma cells, measured by real-time quantitative PCR (Fig. 4B ). XAV939 significantly inhibited LiCl-stimulated nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin in human leiomyoma cells (Fig.  4C ). GST-ICAT pull-down assays revealed a remarkable decrease in active \u03b2-catenin upon treatment of human leiomyoma cells with XAV939 (Fig. 4D ).\n\nBecause many \u03b2-catenin target genes are involved in cell proliferation, we hypothesized that enhanced WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling in leiomyoma cells contributes to leiomyoma tumor growth in humans. Notably, human leiomyoma cell primary cultures contain a substantial level of GST-ICAT-precipitable \u03b2-catenin at baseline (Fig. 2D and Fig. 4D ). Activation of \u03b2-catenin signaling has been spontaneously observed in a number of primary cell cultures (36, 41) . We tested whether the inhibition of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling alters human leiomyoma cell proliferation. ICAT, niclosamide, and XAV939, specifically inhibited canonical WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling and decreased WNT-dependent transcription in primary cultures of human leiomyoma cells, which resulted in reduced cell growth and proliferation in vitro.\n\nOur findings add to the existing body of knowledge on the critical role that the WNT/\u03b2catenin signaling pathway plays in not only development and adult tissue homeostasis but also tumor development and fibrogenesis (11, 25, (42) (43) . Selective deletion of \u03b2-catenin in uterine mesenchyme during embryonic development significantly reduces uterine size and replaces it with adipocytes, thus completely disrupting normal myometrial smooth muscle differentiation and regeneration (33) (34) (44) (45) . Conversely, selective overexpression of constitutively activated \u03b2-catenin in uterine mesenchyme during embryonic development and in adults gives rise to leiomyoma-like tumors in the uterus of all female mice (11) . This suggests that \u03b2-catenin plays a key role in stem cell renewal and differentiation to the smooth muscle phenotype observed in myometrial and leiomyoma tissues, and that the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway may be promising target for new therapeutics (46) . Uterine leiomyomas are monoclonal tumors, with growth of the neoplasm occurring via clonal expansion from a single cell; this raises the possibility that interventions targeted at the mechanisms that underlie cell expansion may be particularly effective in the treatment of uterine leiomyomas (47) . Components of the WNT pathway are prime drug development targets, particularly the accessible plasma membrane receptors such as Frizzled. Vuga and colleagues found that WNT5a can increase fibroblast proliferation through a \"noncanonical\" or \u03b2-catenin/TCF-independent signaling mechanism, indicating that both canonical and noncanonical WNTs may contribute to tumorigenesis (48) . Given that WNT/\u03b2-catenin target genes are cell-type and cell-context dependent, identifying the WNT/\u03b2-catenin-regulated target genes in human leiomyoma requires similar unbiased approaches.\n\nMost leiomyomas contain specific genetic mutations such as those found in MED12, suggesting that transformation of normal myocytes into abnormal myocytes is required at some point during the genesis of a leiomyoma (49) . MED12 binds directly to \u03b2-catenin and regulates canonical WNT signaling (50) . Interestingly, expression of WNT4, an activator of \u03b2-catenin, is markedly elevated in leiomyoma with MED12 mutations versus those without mutations (42) . These observations point to a mechanism involving MED12 mutations and WNT/\u03b2-catenin activation that supports cell proliferation in uterine leiomyoma tissue (50) (51) .\n\nInterestingly, the size and number of \u03b2-catenin-driven leiomyoma-like tumors increases with parity in mice, suggesting that exposure to steroid hormones may interact with activated \u03b2-catenin to accelerate tumorigenesis. Moreover, activated \u03b2-catenin induces expression of transforming growth factor-\u03b23 (TGF\u03b23), which induces proliferation and ECM formation in human leiomyoma tissue (11, 52) . It is known that \u03b2-catenin signaling antagonizes adipogenesis by inhibiting the adipogenic transcription factors CCAAT/ enhancer binding protein-\u03b1 (C/EBP-\u03b1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (53) . Two percent of all leiomyomas contain adipocytes that have undergone metaplasia. This suggests that aberrant \u03b2-catenin signaling affects the tumor initiation and tumor maintenance in uterine leiomyoma.\n\nThe mechanism of action of niclosamide is thought to be through the internalization of Fzd1 and downregulation of WNT pathway intermediaries (39) . In its common usage as an antihelminthic, it is believed to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation (54) (55) . It has recently been found to be effective at low micromolar concentrations in preventing the synthesis of corona virus proteins in a tissue culture model of severe acute respiratory syndrome (56) . It is known that the function of \u03b2-catenin is controlled by ubiquitination and ultimately degradation by the proteasome; a possible mechanism of niclosamide function might be its effect on either the ubiquitination or a proteolytic pathway to cause degradation of \u03b2-catenin (57) . Recent studies found that XAV939 inhibits the PARP domain of Tankyrase 1 and 2 and destabilizes AXIN1 and 2 by PARsylation (58) . In the current study, we showed by TOPflash assay that niclosamide and XAV939 can inhibit WNT pathway activation in leiomyoma cells. We attempted to rule out nonspecific toxic effects of Niclosamide or XAV939 on cells using the LDH assay. We noticed morphologic changes in these cells after treatments. Thus, further studies will be needed to assess nonspecific toxic effects of these compounds both on diseased and healthy tissues.\n\nNiclosamide and XAV939 were administered orally in the referenced reports (40, 59) . It can be speculated that the systemic treatment works because the Wnt canonical signaling is highly active in the diseased tissue, therefore it is more susceptible to the effects of the drugs compared to healthy tissue, allowing for a lower dose to be administered. However, reducing undesirable side effects should always be a goal when developing novel therapies. Consequently, to avoid any off-target effects, it might be attractive to develop a vaginal delivery system, which can deliver therapeutics locally and avoid systemic complications.\n\nIn summary, we showed that the downregulation of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling, via ICAT, niclosamide, or XAV939, has antitumor effects on primary cultures of human leiomyoma cells in vitro. Our study demonstrates that sustained activation of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling in leiomyoma cells can enhance activities associated with leiomyoma formation, such as proliferation. However, given that WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling controls cell-fate decisions throughout development, often controlling the balance between progenitor cells and their descendants, we speculate that cells serving as progenitors to leiomyoma may be a key target of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling in leiomyoma tumorigenesis (60). XAV939 and WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling in human leiomyoma cells. (A) XAV939 effect on LiCl-induced WNT/\u03b2-catenin/TCFresponsive reporter activation. Cells were transiently cotransfected with pRL-CMV and either the TOPflash or FOPflash firefly luciferase reporter plasmid prior to treatment with LiCl and/or XAV939 for 24 h. Each reporter plasmid/condition was transfected into cells plated in triplicate wells, and data are reported as the mean TOPflash activity normalized for transfection efficiency (pRL) and construct background (FOPflash) \u00b1 SD for six independent experiments. (B) XAV939 and inhibits LiClinduced WNT/\u03b2-catenin target gene expression in human leiomyoma cells. Cells were treated with NaCl or LiCl to activate \u03b2catenin and induce downstream expression of WNT/\u03b2-catenin target genes AXIN2 and NKD1. Total RNA was extracted to determine expression of AXIN2 and NKD1 by quantitative real-time PCR. Results are expressed as the mean expression \u00b1 SD of AXIN2 and NKD1 relative to GAPDH from four independent experiments. (C) XAV939 treatment effect on nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin in human leiomyoma cells. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed on leiomyoma cells after treatment with NaCl or LiCl and DMSO or XAV939, using an anti-\u03b2-catenin antibody (green) followed by Hoechst nuclear counterstaining (blue). Merged images of \u03b2-catenin (green) and Hoechst (blue) staining are also shown. Representative images from five independent experiments, bar = 20 \u03bcm. Arrowheads indicate nucleus. (D) XAV939 treatment and \u03b2-catenin levels in human leiomyoma cells. Whole cell lysates from leiomyoma cells treated with DMSO or XAV939 were affinity precipitated with GST-ICAT to isolate cytosolic \u03b2-catenin. Active \u03b2-catenin bound to GST-ICAT was probed with an anti-\u03b2-catenin antibody. Representative immunoblots from three independent samples are shown. Actin loading controls were taken from inputs. *P<.05."}
