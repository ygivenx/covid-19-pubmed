{"title": "Isolation, purification and immunobiological activity of a new water-soluble bee pollen polysaccharide from Crataegus pinnatifida Bge", "body": "In the past few years, outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Bird Flu virus, continuing spread of HIV/AIDS and emergence of resistance against current drugs prompt researchers to look for new protective measures against these threats. Innate immune stimulation has been shown to be effective to keep away from emerging infectious diseases. In order to reduce damage to the human body, much effort has thus been made in the search for natural immunomodulation agents (Hackett, 2003) . Polysaccharides are known as biopolymers and shown to play key roles in therapeutic agents. Published data indicates that numerous polysaccharides isolated from plants, epiphytes and animals have been proven to be fewer side effects and possess a wide range of biological functions such as anti-tumor, immunomodulation and anti-oxidation properties (Amarowicz, Naczk, & Shahidi, 2000; Fujii, Maeda, Suzuki, & Ishida, 1978; Jimenez-Medina et al., 2008; Liu, Ooi, & Chang, 1997; Ooi & Liu, 2000; Yen & Chen, 1996) . Consequently, large numbers of Chinese herbal medicines and edible mushrooms are extensively studied and some of them have been applied in the clinical treatment. For example, the polysaccharides of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fish (Cheng, Wan, Wang, Jin, & Xu, 2008) , Lentinus edodes, (Kosaka, Wani, Hattori, & Yamashita, 1982) and Lingzhi (Di, Chan, Leung, & Huie, 2003) .\n\nIn the present study, we isolated a new immunostimulating polysaccharide from bee pollen of a fruit Crataegus pinnatifida Bge., commonly called Hawthorn, which is a well-known Chinese herbal medicine used for the treatment of various diseases as well as a tonic medicine for thousands of years. Bee pollen is the male gametophyte of gymnosperm and angiosperm. It contains all nutrients which are necessary for plant growth and development and also targets the entire human body, which is a special boost to the reproductive, immune, and nervous systems (Kroyer & Hegedus, 2001; Serra Bonvehi, Soliva Torrento, & Centelles Lorente, 2001; Uzbekova, Makarova, Khvoynitskaya, & Slepnev, 2003) . In the USA, bee pollen is defined by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 as Dietary Supplement used to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake. Since 20 years ago, interests on the pollen have been increasing and there are numerous studies on its nutrition contents and extracts. However, most of the researches are concentrated on the application for their development. There is little information about the bee pollen polysaccharide and biological functions. From this standpoint, we investigated a new bee pollen polysaccharide which is seldom mentioned in the previous papers.\n\nAlthough the polysaccharide has been recognized as one of the main chemical components of immunomodulatory, there is rare attention about polysaccharide of bee pollen on the immune system both in vivo and in vitro. In this paper, we modified the previous method to isolate the carbohydrate compounds from the bee pollen of C. pinnatifida Bge., and found a novel water-soluble polysaccharide, which had scarcely been reported. We named it C. pinnatifida Bge. polysaccharide (CPP). Moreover, we adopted a synthesis method to break wall of bee pollen, including the mechanic way, the temperature difference way and the enzyme way. This paper mainly describes isolation and purification of the CPP; mean molecular weight survey of the CPP by HPGPC, structural characterizations of the CPP and also refers to some preliminary immune stimulating properties. Further studies on the CPP will be summarized in our next paper. The results suggest it may be a potential immunomodulation agent which can play a decisive role in innate immune defense against virus-infected and malignant cells by virtue of their ability to recognize and destroy abnormal cells.\n\nThe bee pollen of C. pinnatifida Bge. was commercially available in Beijing, China. The standard monosaccharides (D-glucose, L-rhamnose, D-xylose, D-galactose, D-ribose, D-mannose, D-arabinose, L-fucose, D-glucuronic acid and L-galacturonic acid) and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), concanavalin A (ConA), pectinase and trypsin were purchased from Amresco Co. (USA) and Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA) and medium RPMI-1640, fetal calf serum from Gibco Invitrogen Co. (Gibco, USA). Dextrans of different molecular weights, DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B and Sephadex G-100 were purchased from the Pharmacia Co. (Uppsala, Sweden). All other reagents used were of analytical grade.\n\nThe dried bee pollen of C. pinnatifida Bge. was ground into powder (100 g) and was preserved by freezing for 48 h and defatted with 1 L of 9:1 ethyl ether-ethanol (v/v) at 35\u00b0C for 6 h under stirring, and the supernatant was removed. The residue was kept below 20\u00b0C again for 24 h, and then put it into boiling distilled water under stirring for 30 min, and cooled the water to 60\u00b0C. After mixing with 1% (m/m) pectinase the residue was extracted with distilled water (m/v = 1:10) for 3 h. After each 3-h period of water extraction and inactivating pectinase, the water extracts were collected and the residues were extracted again for three cycles. The combined extracts were pooled, concentrated in a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure at 50\u00b0C and filtered. Then the filtrate was precipitated by adding 95% ethanol (five times the volume of aqueous extract) at 4\u00b0C, followed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 20 min. The precipitate was dissolved in 400 mL of water and deproteinized with 10% (m/m) trypsin at 65\u00b0C, pH = 7, 3 h (Song, Meng, & Xu, 2007) . After inactivating trypsin, the resulting aqueous fraction was extensively dialyzed against tap water for 2 days and then distilled water for 2 days, then the crude polysaccharide fraction was obtained by precipitation in four fold volume of anhydrous ethanol and washed with acetone and ethyl ether three times to yield the crude polysaccharide (8.5 g) known as CPP in the subsequent description.\n\nThe CPP (400 mg) was dissolved in distilled water, centrifuged, and then the supernatant was applied to a column of DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (2.6 \u00c2 40 cm) equilibrated with 25 mmol/L Tris-HCl buffer (pH = 8.0), and eluted with 25 mmol/L Tris-HCl buffer (pH = 8.0), followed by 0.02 to 1 mol/L NaCl Tris-HCl buffer (25 mmol/L, pH = 8.0) linear gradient at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The yielded fractions were measured according to the total carbohydrate content quantified by the phenol-sulfuric acid method at 490 nm. The elution profile detected by the phenol-sulfuric acid assay showed two big elution peaks, and the protein and the nucleic acid were measured by Varian Cary100 Bio UV/visible spectrophotometer (USA). The collected fractions, which had been analyzed for their total sugar contents were pooled, dialyzed and lyophilized. The whole procedure is shown in Fig. 1 .\n\nTo test the homogeneity of the purified polysaccharides, a column of Sephadex G-100 (1.0 \u00c2 100 cm) was used, loading 100 mg of the above purified two fractions for each run. The column was equilibrated with 0.1 mol/L NaCl Tris-HCl buffer (25 mmol/L, pH = 8.0) and eluted with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The obtained fractions were pooled, dialyzed and freeze dried to obtain purified polysaccharides. The products were subjected to the subsequent analyses.\n\nTotal sugar content was determined as anhydroglucose by the modified phenol-sulfuric acid method as D-glucose equivalents (Dubois, Gilles, Hamilton, Rebers, & Smith, 1956) . Uronic acids were analyzed colorimetrically by the sulfuric acid-carbazole analysis using galacturonic acid as standard (Dische, 1947) . Proteins were estimated by the Bradford assay, (Bradford, 1976) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Fehling's reagent reaction, iodine-potassium iodide reaction and Ferric chloride reaction were used to analyze the polysaccharide.\n\nThe homogeneity and the molecular weight of CPP-1 and CPP-2 were determined by high performance gel permeation chromatography (HPGPC), (Wei & Fang, 1989) which was performed on a Shimadzu LC-10ATvp HPLC system fitted with TSK-GEL G3000PWxl 7.8 cm (i.d.) \u00c2 30.0 cm gel filtration columns and a Shimadzu RID-10A detector set at 40\u00b0C. A Millennium32 version Workstation was used for the calculation of average molecular weights. A sample solution (20 ll of 0.3% polysaccharide) was injected in each run, with 0.7% Na 2 SO 4 as the mobile phase at 0.5 mL/min, with 1.6 MPa. Standard dextrans (T-130, T-80, T-50, T-25 and T-10) were passed through the calibrated column, and then the elution volumes were plotted against the logarithm of their respective molecular weights. The elution volume of the purified polysaccharide was plotted in the same graph, and the molecular weight was determined.\n\nMonosaccharide analysis was investigated according to the previous methods with some modifications (Jones & Albersheim, 1972; Oades, 1967) , the polysaccharide CPP-1 and CPP-2 (20 mg) were hydrolyzed separately with 2 mol/L CF 3 COOH (1 mL) for 3 h at 120\u00b0C. The acid in excess was completely removed by distilled water. Then the hydrolyzed products were reduced with NaBH 4 (50 mg), followed by acidification with acetic acid. It was then co-distilled with methanol to remove the excess boric acid; the reduced sugars (alditols) were acetylated with 1:1 pyridine-acetic anhydride in water bath for 1 h at 90\u00b0C to give the alditol acetates. The alditol acetates of authentic standards (D-glucose, L-rhamnose, D-xylose, D-galactose, D-ribose, D-mannose, L-arabinose, L-fucose, Dglucuronic acid and L-galacturonic acid) with myo-inositol as the internal standards were prepared and subjected to GC analysis separately as mentioned above. Gas chromatography (GC) of the alditol acetate derivatives of monosaccharides was done on an Varian 3400 GC (Hewlett-Packard Component, USA) with a capillary column SP-2320 (30 m \u00c2 0.32 mm i.d.), a GC (HP3365) fitted with a flameionization detector. The chromatographic conditions were used: high-purity nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 8 cm 3 /min. The temperature of the injector and detector was 280\u00b0C. An initial column temperature held at 130\u00b0C for 2 min, then programmed at a rate of 10\u00b0C/min to 250\u00b0C and kept at 250\u00b0C for 20 min.\n\nThe CPP-1 (20 mg) was methylated thrice according to the previous method (Hakomori, 1964) . Complete methylation was conformed by the disappearance of the OH band (3200-3700 cm \u00c01 ) in the IR spectrum. The methylated products were hydrolyzed, reduced and acetylated (Sweet, Shapiro, & Albersheim, 1975) . The partially methylated alditol acetates were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). GC-MS was done on a HP5890 (II) instrument (Hewlett-Packard Component, USA) with an HPS quartz capillary column (25 m \u00c2 0.22 mm \u00c2 0.2 nm), and at temperatures programmed from 120 to 140\u00b0C at 1\u00b0C/min.\n\nInfrared spectra of polysaccharides were recorded on a Thermo Electron Nexus 8700 FT-IR spectrophotometer (USA). Samples were dried at 35-44\u00b0C in vacuum over P 2 O 5 for 48 h prior to making pellet with KBr powder.\n\n2.9. Assay of immunobiological activity 2.9.1. Animals\n\nSpecific pathogen free (SPF) BABL/c mice (18.0-20.0 g, 6-8 weeks old, female) were purchased from the Animal Research Center, Center for The Academy of Military Medical Sciences, China. They were randomized in polycarbonate cages containing sawdust bedding (five in each cage). They received standard mouse chow and water ad libitum. The room conditions were maintained at 22 \u00b1 2\u00b0C with relative humidity of 50 \u00b1 5% and 12 h light/dark cycle at least 9 days before experiment.\n\nA complete culture medium having culture medium RPMI 1640 supplemented with HEPES buffer 10 lmol/L, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 lg/mL penicillin, 100 lg/mL streptomycin, 5 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 mol/L 2mercaptoethanol and heat-inactivated fetal calf serum was used for phagocytosis of macrophage assay. Animals were randomly divided into various groups with five mice each. The polysaccharides were dissolved in saline and administrated intraperitoneally to mice of experimental groups at different doses of 10, 50, 100 mg/kg body weight. The drug of 0.5 mL dose was given daily one time for 9 days. Control animals were given same volume of sterile saline alone. Macrophages were prepared from BALB/c mice according to the previous procedure (Kim, Choi, Lee, & Park, 2004) . Chicken red blood cells (CRBC) were used to assess the phagocytosis of macrophage. Briefly, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 1 h after intraperitoneally injected 0.5 mL 1% CRBC, then injected 2.5 mL Hank's. Activated Macrophages were obtained by lavage of the cavity into microscope slide. After centrifugation at 1500 rpm/min for 10 min, the supernatant was removed and the free CRBC were lysed by sterile 0.16 mmol/L NH 4 Cl lysing buffer. Macrophages were dyed with Giemsa-PBS buffer within 3.0 min right after the microscope slide was air-dried. Microscope slide were washed by PBS and counted with microscope. The phagocytosis index and phagocytosis rate were measured by counting the number of phagocytosed CRBC per 200 macrophage cells. Each experiment was performed in quintuplicate.\n\nThe BALB/c mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and spleens were collected under aseptic conditions in RPMI-1640. Spleen cells of mice were prepared by gently mincing and grinding the spleen fragment in RPMI-1640 medium on a fine steel mesh, and centrifuged at 1500 rpm/min at 4\u00b0C for 10 min, and then removed the supernatant. The residue dissolved in 10 mL Tris-NH 4 Cl for breaking red blood cells and kept it at room temperature for 5-10 min with shaking and centrifuged at 1500 rpm/min at 4\u00b0C for 10 min again. The supernatant was gently removed and the precipitate was transferred to a sterile container and washed with RPMI-1640. At last, the cells were resuspended in 5 mL RPMI-1640 medium, and cells viability exceeded 95%. NK cell cytotoxicity was assayed as previous described with a minor modification (Sarangi, Ghosh, Bhutia, Mallick, & Maiti, 2006) . Briefly, an aliquot of 100 lL of splenocytes named effector cells at 5 \u00c2 10 6 cells/mL was seeded into each well of a 96-well flat-bottom microtiter plate, thereafter Con A (positive control group, final concentration 5.0 lg/ mL), the medium (negative control group), the polysaccharides (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 lg/mL, final concentration) were added giving a final volume of 200 lL, and then incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO 2 incubator. The target cells of K562 were resuspended in the RPMI-1640 medium with the final concentration of 5 \u00c2 10 5 cells/ mL. One hundred microliters of K562 target cells and 100 lL of effector cells were added to 96-well plates to give the effectorto-target cell (E:T) ratio of 10:1. After incubation for 4 h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 and saturated humidity, MTT was added into each well and centrifuged (1500 rpm/min, 5 min) to remove the untransformed MTT carefully by pipetting. The plate was incubated for another 4 h, followed to each well a total of 100 lL including 10% SDS and 50% DMSO was added to fully dissolve the colored material. The OD (570nm) was measured on an ELISA reader (Model 550, Bio-Rad Instruments). Each experiment was performed in quintuplicate.\n\nThe following formula was used to calculate% cytotoxicity:\n\nNote: OD E -the effector cell wells OD (570nm) ; OD T -the target cell wells OD (570nm) ; OD (E+T) -the effector-to-target cell wells OD (570 nm) .\n\n2.9.4. Assay for spleen lymphocyte proliferation Cell proliferation was assessed by using 3-(4,5-dimethyithiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)-based colorimetric assay (Mosmann, 1983) . Splenocytes from the mice were prepared as described in previous studies. Briefly, cells of different spleno-cyte populations in 96-well plates (5 \u00c2 10 6 cells/well) were exposed to Con A, the medium and the polysaccharides in incubator at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 for 72 h. The MTT solution (1 mg/mL of phosphate buffer saline) was added to 96-well plates and diluted to 5 lg/mL in every well, and then further incubated for 6 h at 37\u00b0C. After aspirating the supernatant from the wells, 200 lL of DMSO was added and shaken for 20 min. The absorbance of each well was then read at 570 nm using an ELISA reader (Model 550, Bio-Rad Instruments). Each experiment was performed in quintuplicate.\n\nThe data were expressed as means \u00b1 standard errors (SE) and examined for their statistical significance of difference with Student's t-test. P-values of less than .05 were considered to be statistically significant.\n\nThe crude CPP was obtained as a water-soluble light yellow powder from the bee pollen of C. pinnatifida Bge. by hot water extraction. Wall-breaking treatments for this kind of bee pollen were carried out by synthesizing three ideal ways. It was demonstrated that wall-breaking rate was more significantly improved using this synthesis method as compare with using only one of them. The total yield of water-soluble polysaccharides was 8.5% by this isolation procedure, much higher than the yield of 1.5% from the pollen of Brassica napus L. (Yang, Guo, Zhang, & Wu, 2007) . This yield of 8.5% was also higher than the yield of 6.92% from pollen of timothy grass (Phleum pratense L.) extracted by 0.1 mol/L NH 4 HCO 3 (Brecker et al., 2005) . Therefore, the adopted conditions of the isolation procedure here were helpful to obtain water-soluble polysaccharides from the bee pollen of C. pinnatifida Bge. with an ideal yield before further optimizing. The CPP was separated and purified by gel filtration in DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column. Two fractions of CPP-1 and CPP-2 were eluted as shown in Fig. 2 . CPP-1 and CPP-2 peaks appeared between 7-14 and 71-78 tubes, respectively. CPP-1 is white powder and CPP-2 is light yellow powder, soluble in hot water with characteristic absorption of polysaccharide at 190 nm, and no absorption at 280 and 260 nm for protein and nucleic acid. Both of CPP-1 and CPP-2 were further chromatographed on the Sephadex G-100 column (gel-permeation chromatography). The single and symmetrical peaks were shown in Fig. 3 .\n\nThe polysaccharide contents CPP, CPP-1 and CPP-2 were found to be 8.31%, 26.07% and 26.59%, respectively, as determined by the phenol-sulfuric acid method. Except CPP, they had a negative response in the Bradford test, indicating the absence of protein.\n\nThe positive results of Sulfuric acid-carbazole reaction suggest that uronic acid were present in CPP, CPP-1 and CPP-2. The results of Fehling' test, ironic chloridate reaction and iodine reaction are shown in Table 1 .\n\nHigh performance size-exclusion chromatography of the CPP-1 and CPP-2 on Shimadzu LC-10ATvp HPLC system suggests that the polymers are homogeneous. The results were consistent with the Sephadex G-100 column described. Based on calibration with standard dextrans, the apparent molecular weight of the polysaccharides would be 3.7 \u00c2 10 5 Da and 7.8 \u00c2 10 4 Da.\n\nUsually, GC analysis could give the accurate content of sugars in the polysaccharides. On hydrolysis by 2 mol/L CF 3 COOH, two kinds of polysaccharide were detected by GC analysis. The CPP-1 was composed of L-rhamnose, L-fucose, D-arabinose, D-xylose, D-mannose, D-galactose and D-glucose, the relative proportions were estimated by GC as 0.67:0.44:10.16:0.66:1.03:5.51:9.94, respectively. While CPP-2 composition was found by GC to consists of five kinds of monosaccharide: L-rhamnose, D-arabinose, D-mannose, D-galactose and D-glucose, whose molar ratios were 2.12:9.82:3.60: 0.89:5.56, respectively, and also with small amounts of uronic acid. Both of CPP-1 and CPP-2 were rich in D-arabinose and D-glucose, and also contained D-mannose. Generally, there is the close relationship between D-mannose and immune activity. Hence the main study was focused on immune stimulation.\n\nThe CPP-1 and CPP-2 were individually methylated and hydrolyzed, and the products were then converted into alditol acetates for GC-MS analysis. The combination of the fragmentation pattern and retention time of the CPP-1 and CPP-2 suggested that the reduced polysaccharide were made of 1,5-linked D-arabinoside residues. Methylation results are given in Table 2 , CPP-1 was concluded from Table 2 that: (a) it was mainly composed of 1,5-L-Araf, T-, 1,6-, 1,3,6-, 1,4-, 1,4,6-D-Galp, T-, 1,3-D-Manp, T-, 1,4-D-Glcp; (b) the mole ratio of T-, 1,3-D-Manp was 45.8:54.2, the backbone of mannan consisted of Manp (54.2%) residues with 1 ? 3 glycosidic linkage. The other Manp residues (45.8%) existed as non-reduced ends, which indicated that all T-Manp were not linked with mannan, they could locate in galactan branch or directly in the backbone of CPP-1; (c) the mole ratio of T-, 1,6-, 1,3,6-, 1,4-, 1,4,6-D-Galp was 35.5:32.8:26.2:2.0:3.5, Galp residue (62.5%) was mainly linked by 1 ? 6 glycosidic linkage. Branched chains linked with the oxygen atom at the third site of Galp residue (26.2%). In addition, some Galp residues (2.0%) were linked with 1 ? 4 glycosidic linkage, the other Galp residues (35.5%) existed as non-reduced ends; (d) Araf was the main glycosyl unit of CPP-1. There were about 89.6% Araf residues linked with 1 ? 5 glycosidic linkage. Oxygen substitution at the third site of Araf (9.6%) would take place and 0.9% Araf residues existed as non-reduced ends. Meanwhile, as summarized in Table 3 \n\nIn order to investigate the functional groups of the purified CPP, the spectra were recorded at the absorbance mode from 4000 to 400 cm \u00c01 (mid infrared region). Typical IR spectra for the two fractions are presented in Fig. 4 . At least triplicate spectra were recorded for each sample. There are two types of end carbonglucoside bonds: aand b-styles, which can be judged by IR. In IR spectra, the C-H bond in a-style has an absorption peak nearby 844 cm \u00c01 , while that of the C-H bond is in b-style nearby 891 cm \u00c01 (Barker, Bourne, Stacey, & Whiffen, 1954) . The FT-IR spectrum of CPP-1 and CPP-2 showed a strong band between 950 and 1160 cm \u00c01 attributed to the stretching vibrations of pyranose ring. A characteristic absorption at 895 cm \u00c01 was also observed, indicating the b-configuration of the sugar units. There was no absorption at 850 cm \u00c01 for the a-configuration. While in the anomeric region (905-876 cm \u00c01 ), both CPP-1 and CPP-2 exhibited the obvious characteristic absorption, suggesting the existence of b-D-glucopyranosyl (Barker et al., 1954) .\n\nA characteristic absorption band appeared at 1650 cm \u00c01 and was assigned to the stretching vibration of the carboxyl group (CAO) of the CPP-1 and CPP-2, meanwhile another absorption band between 2930 and 2932 cm \u00c01 was intensified and attributed to the stretching vibration of the methylene group (C-H). In addition, a continuous absorption beginning at approximately the region of 3400 cm \u00c01 is characteristic of a carbohydrate ring (Jong Min Lim et al., 2005; Yanfei Peng, Zeng, & Xu, 2006) . 3.7. Immunobiological activity 3.7.1. Effect of macrophage assay As a first step towards understanding the immunomodulatory activity of the polysaccharide CPP, we investigated the effect on phagocytic rates and phagocytic indexes of macrophage. As summarized in Table 3 , compared with those in the control group, the phagocytic rates and indexes of the CPP-1 and CPP-2 were significantly higher in the groups treated with10, 50 mg/kg d (for phagocytic rates and phagocytic indexes: P < .05) and 100 mg/ kg d (for phagocytic rates and phagocytic indexes: P < .01).\n\nNK cells make up 10-15% of peripheral blood lymphocytes in humans (Campbell & Colonna, 2001) and represent the first line of defense against many pathogens, especially viruses. Upon activation, NK cells begin to proliferate and secrete cytokines as a means of communication with other components of the immune system, in particular T cells. So we investigated the effect of NK cells cytotoxicity. As shown in Fig. 5 , CPP-2 had higher effect on NK cell for its cytotoxicity effect with the concentration of 50 lg/ mL (P < .01). Compared with the control group, significant enhancements in CPP-1 (50 lg/mL, P < .01) was observed. We can draw a conclusion that CPP-1 and CPP-2 at suitable dose can enhance effect of NK cells cytotoxicity. Generally, polysaccharide inducing NK cells activation increases with increasing concentration of polysaccharide. While interestingly, CPP-1 and CPP-2 inducing NK cell activation decreased with increasing concentration a Relative molar ratio, calculated from the ratio of peak areas. b Mol.% of the parent CPP-1 and CPP-2, calculated from the ratio of peak areas. when the concentration was greater than the optimal concentration. It was observed that the high concentrations of CPP-1 and CPP-2 resulted in the formation of over-saturated solution. The solution enhanced the absorption at 570 nm and decreased the NK cell activation finally. Meanwhile, NK-cell mediated cytotoxicity was modulated by various cytokines, including IL-1, IL-2, IL-12, and interferon (Chichen Michael Chien et al., 2004) , so further study of the effect of the high concentration of CPP-1 and CPP-2 on these cytokines is in order ongoing to immunotherapeutic strategies that will enhance the anti-tumor activity with NK cells.\n\nLymphocytes are the key effector cells of mammalian immune system and our studies show that the different subpopulations of lymphocytes are activated by purified CPP at varying levels. The purified CPP-1 and CPP-2 were considerably able to proliferate splenocytes as shown in Fig. 6 . At 50 lg/mL of CPP-2, splenocyte proliferation index was maximum as compared to CPP-1. CPP-2 can be considered as efficient splenocyte proliferators.\n\nSince 20 years ago, interest on the bee pollen has been increasing and there are numerous researches on their nutrition contents and extracts. In fact, bee pollen was known as its health and medical functions, including anti-tumor function and immunostimulation (Hackett, 2003) . However, many investigations were achieved directly with bee pollen or bee pollen's extractions, but bee pollen's chemical components of immunostimulation remain not very clear. In this study, we have succeeded in isolating the polysaccharide CPP from bee pollen of C. pinnatifida Bge. Two water-soluble polysaccharide fractions, termed CPP-1 and CPP-2, were purified and the molecular weights were approximately 3.7 \u00c2 10 5 Da and 7.8 \u00c2 10 4 Da, respectively. FT-IR and quantitative carbohydrate composition analysis indicated that CPP-1 and CPP-2 were b-type heteropolysaccharides with pyran group, among which CPP-1 was composed of L-rhamnose, L-fucose, D-arabinose, D-xylose, Dmannose, D-galactose and D-glucose at the molar ratio of 0.67:0.44:10.16:0.66:1.03:5.51:9.94, respectively; CPP-2 consisted of L-rhamnose, D-arabinose, D-mannose, D-galactose, D-glucose, whose molar ratio was 2.12:9.82:3.60:0.89:5.56, respectively. Methylation results of polysaccharides shows that both of CPP-1 and CPP-2 were made of 1,5-linked D-arabinoside residues. CPP-1 was mainly composed of 1,5-L-Araf, T-, 1,6-, 1,3,6-, 1,4-, 1,4,6-D-Galp, T-, 1,3-D-Manp, T-, 1,4-D-Glcp; CPP-2 was primarily composed of 1,5-L-Araf, T-L-Rhap, T-, 1,3-D-Manp, T-, 1,4-D-Glcp. These provide the basic information on this new water-soluble polysaccharide for future their fine structure and determine the structure activity relationships (Deters, Lengsfeld, & Hensel, 2005) .\n\nIn this study, we also discussed the biological activity of CPP for the first time. The immune system is the human's ultimate defense against infectious diseases, tumor and cancer growth. A healthy immune system contains elements that are in balance with one another and if this balance is broken, our immune system will be unable to protect the body against harmful agents or processes. For above reasons, we investigated three aspects of immunomodulatory activity. Purified CPP-1 and CPP-2 showed higher activation on phagocytic rates and phagocytic indexes of macrophage, and the results indicated CPP-1 and CPP-2 were dose-dependent polysaccharides. Additionally, Tumor cell elimination is known to be mediated in part by the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells. We therefore measured the enhanced cytotoxic activity of NK cells as compared with normal mice NK cells activity. Surprisingly, these two fractions were dose-independent and the optimal effect was found at 50 lg/mL (P < .01). And also the result of splenocyte proliferation was very ideal, especially for 50 lg/mL (P < .001). While discussing the biological activity of CPP, we find CPP-2 possessed higher immunomodulatory activity than CPP-1; and concluded that it is associated with compositions of the each monosaccharide. In the previous studies, many complex polysaccharides from plants, epiphytes and animals have been shown to influence the phagocytosis of macrophage, NK cells cytotoxicity and lymphocyte proliferation (Bao, Liu, Fang, & Li, 2001; Sun et al., 2008) , although the assays they used were different. We could not compare the activity of natural polysaccharides on phagocytosis of macrophage, NK cells cytotoxicity and lymphocyte proliferation due to the lack of standardized assays. 5 . Effect of the polysaccharides CPP-1 (A) and CPP-2 (B) at various concentrations, on rat natural killer cell in vitro and control group received PBS. Natural killer cell activity was expressed as the absorbance at 570 nm using an ELISA reader. The % cytotoxicities were represented as means \u00b1 SD of six different observations and compared against PBS control by using Student's t test. Data reported (**) P < .01 were considered significant. Fig. 6 . Effect of the polysaccharides CPP-1 (A) and CPP-2 (B) at various concentrations, on rat spleen cell proliferation in vitro and control group received PBS. Proliferation activity was expressed as the absorbance at 570 nm using an ELISA reader. The results were represented as means \u00b1 SD of six different observations and compared against PBS control by using Student's t test. Data reported (***) P < .001 were considered significant.\n\nAlthough the exact underlying mechanism of CPP is yet unknown, based on the results presented above, we can conclude that CPP has immunomodulatory activity by proliferating splenocyte, and also macrophages and NK cells involved in nonspecific immunity were primarily activated. Further investigations on the relationship between immunomodulatory activity and characteristic structure are presently underway in our laboratory.\n\nIn this study, crude polysaccharide CPP was successfully isolated from bee pollen of C. pinnatifida Bge. by synthesizing three ideal wall-breaking effects including the mechanic way, the temperature difference way and the enzyme way. Two fractions CPP-1 and CPP-2 were purified by DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography. The GC-MS analysis suggested that CPP-1 and CPP-2 were made of 1,5-linked D-arabinoside residues. The complete structure of CPP-1 and CPP-2 were not obtained, but some important structural features were established. Furthermore, the polysaccharides significantly enhanced phagocytic rates and phagocytic indexes of macrophage. Considerable effects were also observed on splenocytes proliferation and the NK cells cytotoxicity, especially with CPP-2. Above all, these two fractions possessed immunostimulatory activity and can be utilized as immunostimulants for food and pharmaceutical industries."}
