{"title": "Reference Gene Selection for Normalization of PCR Analysis in Chicken Embryo Fibroblast Infected with H5N1 AIV *", "body": "The highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by H5N1 has had devastating consequences for poultry production [1, 5, 24] , and the virus has resulted in numerous infections in humans [25] , making understanding of H5N1 viruses increasingly critical for public health.\n\nQuantitative analysis of H5N1 AIV and host mRNA levels is an important tool for the study of host-virus interaction. CEFs , the most commonly used cells in the study of host-avian virus interaction [9, 17] , are the most popular cells used in the study of H5N1 AIV [15] .\n\nHowever, no determination of the ideal reference genes for QPCR in these cells has yet been carried out in the context of H5N1 AIV infection. In this study, the expression stabilities of 11 housekeeping genes commonly used in mammals were compared, in order to select a stable reference gene in normal CEFs and H5N1 AIV infected CEFs. \n\nH5N1 AIV virus isolate (CHSD003), identified and purified by the China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center, was propagated in SPF chicken embryos. The TCID 50 of the virus was determined in CEFs and calculated to be 10 7.67 /0.1 mL according to Reed-Muench [27] .\n\nCEFs were cultured from 10-day-old SPF chicken embryos according to standard procedures [27] . Briefly, 1\u00d7 10 7 cells were added per well in a 24-well \n\nThe expression levels of eleven housekeeping genes were measured by calculating the Ct of each by real-time PCR, and the expression stabilities were evaluated by the GeNorm tool [21] , which determined obtained by using the 2 -\u25b3\u25b3Ct calculation method. [6, 21] .\n\nThe average expression stability M values of 11\n\nhousekeeping genes are shown in Table 2 \n\nThe average expression stability M value of 11 housekeeping genes were shown in Table 2 \n\nThe suitability of reference genes for QPCR depends on stability and expression levels. The release of the full chicken genome sequence has made it possible for a more extensive selection of reference genes in chicken, despite the fact that the functions of many genes in chicken are relatively uncharacterized compared to the mammal genome [10] . For years, ACTB and GAPDH have been widely used as reference genes in classical molecular methods for the analysis of mRNA expression, but they have sometimes been found to be unsuitable for normalization of gene expression by QPCR in mammalian cells [7, 16, 28] .\n\nHowever, studies on the selection of reference genes are rare in avian molecular biology. In this study, eleven housekeeping genes commonly used in mammal biology were selected in order to determine the ideal reference genes in the normal CEF and ACTB was reported to be the best reference gene in CEFs infected with infectious bursal disease virus [11] , but its transcription levels were not constant in NDV infected CEFs [18] . This indicates that the ideal reference genes in CEFs should be selected according to the virus being studied. GAPDH, as a commonly used reference gene in molecular methods, was not the most stably expressed housekeeping gene in the H5N1\n\nAIV infected CEFs. This is consistent with the finding that GAPDH was an unsuitable reference gene in host cells infected with SARS corona virus, human herpesvirus-6, camelpox virus and cytomegalovirus [14] ; however, it was found to be best reference gene in cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus and herpes viruses [23] . Based on these data, it is important to select ideal reference genes for the precise normalization of gene expression levels and viral quantification in the study of the interaction between the cells and viruses.\n\nCEF are not only used as model cells for the study of host responses to avian virus infection [15, 26] , but are also commonly used to study gene function in chicken [2] .\n\nTherefore, quantitative analysis of mRNA expression in CEFs is a useful tool for the study of gene functions in general. Our results showed that GAPDH and HPRT1 were the most stably and most highly expressed reference genes in normal CEFs, so we conclude that these genes are the most useful for the precise analysis of host gene mRNA expression levels by real-time PCR in normal CEFs."}
