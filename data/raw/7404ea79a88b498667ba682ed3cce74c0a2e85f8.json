{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Clinical features and dynamics of viral load in imported and non-imported patients with COVID-19 Clinical Features and Dynamics of Viral Load in Imported and Non-imported Patients with COVID-19 Running title: Comparison of imported and non-imported COVID-19", "body": "Introduction 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019, now known as SARS-CoV-2) infection, which can cause respiratory failure, poses a global threat to public health 1, 2 . The coming 2-3 weeks are crucial in monitoring the situation of community transmission 3, 4 .\n\nThe imported patients with COVID-19 were those who visited or originated from Wuhan city, and were detected at the end of January 2020; subsequently, secondary and tertiary transmissions occurred nationwide 5 . Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital and family settings was confirmed in other geographical regions 6 . Although the speed of transmission declined in China, the concerns about the outbreak of pneumonia in other countries are constantly rising 4, 7, 8 . To date, the differences between the cases of imported, secondary, and tertiary transmission remain largely unknown.\n\nHerein, we analyzed the characteristics of COVID-19 in Changzhou city, Jiangsu province. The clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as the dynamics of viral load, were compared between the imported, secondary, and tertiary patients.\n\nA cohort of 51 patients in Changzhou was confirmed with COVID-19 according to the Chinese guideline for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 9 and admitted to the Third Hospital of Changzhou, a designated hospital. These patients were included from January 23 to February 18, 2020. The outcomes were followed up until February 27, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 2020. The epidemiological history and symptoms data were confirmed by two doctors in a negative-pressure ward. Viral RNA was detected in throat swabs obtained from the patients, and a computer tomography (CT) scan was acquired immediately after symptom onset.\n\nThe 51 patients were divided into three groups, including imported (15 cases), secondary (17 cases), and tertiary (19 cases) according to the epidemiological history.\n\nThe imported patients with COVID-19 were those who visited or originated from Wuhan city, Hubei Province. The secondary patients were defined as those who did not visit or come from Wuhan, but closely contacted with the imported patients. The tertiary cases were those who did not visit Wuhan or contact with the imported patients, but acquired through contact with the secondary cases 10, 11, 12 . All the data of the included individuals were reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nCOVID-19 was confirmed according to the cycle threshold (Ct) values of Orf1ab and N genes by RT-PCR assay. The assay was performed by Changzhou CDC and the Clinical Laboratory of the Third People's Hospital of Changzhou using a commercial kit (Biogerm Medical Biotechnology Co., Shanghai, China). Ct values were inversely related to viral RNA copy numbers 13 , and Ct value <40 was considered positive.\n\nContinuous variables are expressed as median (IQR) or mean \u00b1 standard deviation and compared using Kruskal-Wallis test or one-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc tests to compare the differences between the three groups. Categorical values were expressed as frequencies, and the differences were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. All analyses J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f were performed using SPSS 23.0 software (Chicago, IL, USA). A two-sided P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1 .\n\nTwelve family clusters were found in the present study. Six patients without any symptoms were diagnosed according to the chest CT scans, and the Ct values detected in throat swabs. 10/15 (66.67%) patients in the imported group were males, while almost half of the patients in the secondary and tertiary groups were females. The patients in the tertiary group were significantly older than those in the secondary group (P=0.03) and had more comorbidities than those in the imported group (\u03c7 2 =8.259, P<0.01).\n\nSince none of the patients developed severe pneumonia or ARDS, all patients survived, and no mechanical ventilation was given in the present study. Interestingly, the incubation period for the tertiary group was longer than that for the imported and secondary groups (P<0.01 and P=0.03, respectively).\n\nFever was the most common symptom at the onset of illness (73.33%, 58.82%, and 68.42%, respectively), and about half of the patients (45.45%, 50.00%, and 61.54%, respectively) had a low-grade temperature (<38.0 \u00b0C) with a short duration of fever (<7 days). However, no significant difference was detected in the development of fever and other symptoms, including cough, sputum production, pharyngalgia, fatigue, myalgia, dyspnea, and diarrhea between the three groups (all P>0.05).\n\nFour patients in the tertiary group showed an elevated level (<85 U/L) of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at admission. The level of D-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f dimer, troponina and creatine kinase was normal for all patients.\n\nLeucopenia (white blood cell count <4\u00d710 9 /L) was more common in the tertiary group than that in the imported patients (\u03c7 2 =8.295, P=0.01) ( Table 2) . Moreover, B lymphocyte counts were lower in the tertiary patients as compared to those in the imported group (P<0.01).\n\nCT scan showed that most patients had bilateral pneumonia in the three groups (80.00%, 76.47%, and 73.68%, respectively).\n\nOf the 51 patients, 49 (96.08%) showed positive RNA tests in the throat swabs, while one patient had a positive RNA test in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and another tested positive in the anal swab. As shown in Figure 1 , the viral load in throat swabs with respect to days was analyzed after admission.\n\nThe Ct values detected from the tertiary patients were similar to those from the imported and secondary groups on admission (both P>0.05). For the tertiary group, the viral load was undetectable for half of the patients (52.63%) on day 7 and all patients on day 14 but was positive for 1/3 rd of the patients in the imported and secondary groups on day 14 after the admission.\n\nIn the present study, we analyzed the clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, as well as the dynamics of viral load in patients with COVID-19. Half of the patients had low-grade (<38.0 \u2103) and a short duration of fever (<7 days), while the incubation period was long, and the viral load was undetectable in the early stage in the tertiary group than that in the imported and secondary groups.\n\nJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f or high temperature (>38.0 \u2103), while low-grade fever with or without mild respiratory symptoms was common in the present study because no patients with severe pneumonia were included. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 causes lower respiratory tract lesions even in patients without any clinical symptoms 1, 17 . Interestingly, six patients in the present study had radiological evidence of pneumonia, but no fever or cough during infection.\n\nThese findings were in agreement with those from previous studies 16, 18 . Thus, the chest CT scan needs to be monitored routinely in clinical practice.\n\nAlthough none of the patients developed a severe infection in the present study, the comorbidities were common in tertiary patients, demanding focus on elderly patients.\n\nMoreover, low B lymphocyte counts in the tertiary patients may be related to the comorbidities, thereby necessitating additional studies to elucidate the immunological mechanisms during COVID-19 infection 19 .\n\nTo date, the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 are unclear. Notably, the long incubation period suggests the potential transmission route in tertiary, even asymptomatic, patients. Although lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol have been administered in clinical practice, the effectiveness of inhibiting SARS-CoV2\n\nreplication is yet not confirmed 9 . Interestingly, the viral load could not be detected early in tertiary patients; thus, it could be speculated that the infectivity of SARS-CoV2 may gradually decrease.\n\nNevertheless, the present study has several limitations. First, the incubation period may be short for several patients, who lived in Wuhan, because they can be infected several days before coming to Changzhou. Second, the number of patients is limited, and hence, a multicenter study with a large sample size is essential for further substantiation of these findings.\n\nIn conclusion, COVID-19 can present as pneumonia with the onset of fewer symptoms, and the infectivity of SARS-CoV2 may gradually decrease in tertiary patients.\n\nStudy design: Yuan Xue and Hong Dai.
