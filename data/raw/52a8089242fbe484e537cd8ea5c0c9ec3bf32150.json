{"title": "C19ORF66 broadly escapes viral-induced endonuclease cleavage and restricts Kaposi's 1", "body": "Many viruses including alpha-and gammaherpesviruses, influenza A virus, and SARS 28 coronavirus induce widespread mRNA decay through the use of virally encoded endonucleases 29\n\n(1-5). This process, known as \"host shutoff\", allows viruses to rapidly restrict gene expression in 30 order to dampen immune responses and provide access to the host's resources for viral 31 replication (2,6,7). One well-studied viral endonuclease is the SOX protein encoded by Kaposi's 32 sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). SOX is conserved throughout the herpesvirus family, 33 but only gammaherpesviral SOX homologs display ribonuclease activity in cells (8) (9) (10) and 34 studies indicate that SOX activity is important for the in-vivo viral lifecycle (11,12). Although SOX 35 targets a degenerate RNA motif present on most mRNA (13-15), multiple studies have shown 36 that some transcripts robustly escape SOX-induced decay (16-21). Studying these 'escapees' in 37 aggregate is complicated, however, by the fact that multiple mechanisms can promote apparent 38 escape. These include lack of a targeting motif, indirect transcriptional effects, and active 39 evasion of ribonucleolytic cleavage (16,20-24). This latter phenotype, termed \"dominant 40 escape\", is particularly notable as it involves a specific RNA element whose presence in the 3' 41 UTR of an mRNA protects against SOX cleavage, regardless of whether the RNA contains a 42 targeting motif (19-21). This protective RNA element was termed SRE (for SOX Resistance 43 Element), but we recently showed that the SRE is also effective against a broad range of viral 44 endonucleases. Perhaps more surprisingly, the SRE is unable to restrict endonucleolytic 45 cleavage originating from a cellular endonuclease, making it the first identified viral-specific 46 ribonuclease escape element (19) . We showed that this broad-acting RNA element is not 47\n\nLittle is currently known about these types of RNA elements; how widespread they may 51 be in the genome and how they may contribute to the overall viral-host arms race for the control 52 of resources. To date, only two SRE-bearing dominant escapees are known: the host 53 interleukin-6 (IL-6) (18,20,21) and the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 beta 54 (GADD45B) (19) transcripts. Both the IL-6 and GADD45B SREs were mapped to their 3'UTR 55\n\nand were shown to protect against an array of viral -but not host -RNAses. Furthermore, while 56 little sequence homology was detected among these SREs, we showed that they share 57 similarity in their secondary structure; reinforcing the idea the SRE may function as a platform to 58 recruit a protective protein complex as previously observed (19) (20) (21) . Functionally, while the 59 beneficial role of IL-6 for KSHV during infection is well documented (25-33), the role of 60 GADD45B is still unclear. In fact, GADD45B is repressed during KSHV latency (34) and 61 GADD45B known pro-apoptotic roles may indicate that this transcript escapes to participate in 62 an anti-viral response to host shutoff. 63\n\nHere, taking advantage of the ability of the SRE element to block decay from a diverse 64 set of viral endonucleases, we sought to identify novel escaping mRNAs containing SRE or 65 SRE-like elements in the transcriptome. Using comparative RNA-seq, we uncovered a cluster of 66 75 host mRNAs that escape degradation from four herpesviral endonucleases. Similarly to the 67 previously identified SRE-bearing transcripts, these transcripts were spared from a range of viral 68 -but not host -endonucleases, further supporting that our approach successfully identified 69 Simplex 1 (HSV-1) vhs or an empty vector control were generated using Thy1.1-based cell 97 sorting as described before (45). Total RNA was extracted, polyA enriched and cDNA were 98 generated. cDNA libraries were sequenced with a 100-base single-end read on an Illumina 99\n\nHiSeq4000. Resulting reads were aligned to the human genome (hg38) using Bowtie, replicates 100 were merged using CuffCompare and significant expression fold change between mock and 101 each of the endonuclease conditions were assessed by CuffDiff (Figure 1, Figure S1 & Table  102 S1). The reproducibility between replicate experiments was high ( Fig. 1A-D) , which is in line 103 with previous reports showing that these endonucleases target transcripts in a 104 selective/sequence-specific manner as previously observed (13). As expected, a number of 105 transcripts were significantly affected upon expression of the various herpesviral endonucleases 106 ( Fig. S1) : we observed that between 55-60% of total mRNA were degraded, with muSOX being 107 the most effective of the endonucleases tested here (Fig. S1 ). This rate of degradation is within 108 range of what was observed before (16). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis on the transcripts 109 spared from degradation revealed that they encode proteins that have a wide array of functions, 110 ranging from ion binding to RNA binding (Fig S2) . 111 All rights reserved.

Figure 1E shows a heatmap of the 113 correlation matrix across all transcripts. A cluster encompassing 75 transcripts (Table S2 ) 114\n\nrepresents the mRNA that escape degradation from all 4 herpesviral endonucleases. We 115 hypothesize that this cluster of transcripts is likely to include mRNA containing SRE or SRE-like 116 elements. cycle upon doxycycline treatment (46,47). As opposed to the housekeeping gene GAPDH that is 128 naturally susceptible to host shutoff, we observed that the mRNA levels of these candidate 129 SRE-bearing mRNAs remained unchanged in reactivated iSLK.219 cells as measured by RT-130 qPCR ( Fig. 2A) confirming that these transcripts are resistant to host shutoff in lytically infected 131 cells. Additionally, we recently showed that SRE-containing transcripts are resistant to 132 endonucleases beyond the herpesvirus family (19). We next tested the ability of these novel 133 escapees to evade the heterologous host shutoff from the influenza A virus endonuclease (IAV; 134 PA-X). As shown in Figure 2B , contrary to GAPDH, the candidate transcripts were resistant to 135 all endonucleases tested, including PA-X. Finally, one characteristic of SRE-containing mRNAs 136 All rights reserved.

To test whether this 137 was also the case for our novel candidate SRE-bearing transcripts, we monitored cleavage 138 upon expression of the nsp1 protein from SARS coronavirus. Nsp1 is not a nuclease but rather 139 activates mRNA cleavage by an as yet unknown cellular endonuclease via a mechanism 140 reminiscent of no-go decay (48,49). Nsp1 thus allows us to induce RNA decay using a viral 141 trigger but carried out by a cellular endonuclease. Nsp1 was transfected into 293T cells and 142 depletion of the candidate transcripts was measured by RT-qPCR. Similar to what we observed 143 before, the candidate escapee mRNAs were not protected in nsp1-expressing cells (Fig. 2C) . 144\n\nCollectively, these results suggest that the escaping mRNAs identified in our comparative RNA-145 seq dataset are broadly protected against viral but not cellular endonucleases and we predict 146 that these transcripts may contain an SRE or an SRE-like element that provides broad 147 protection. 148 149\n\nThe pool of escaping transcripts did not appear to be strongly enriched for particular 151 functions or processes when evaluated by GO-term analysis. We thus proceeded to manually 152 mine the literature to identify functions that could be important during viral infection. We were 153 drawn to C19ORF66 (also known as RyDEN, IRAV, and SVA-1), as it was reported to be an 154\n\nanti-viral interferon stimulated gene (ISG) in the context of multiple viral infections (40,43,44). 155\n\nFurthermore, the transcript for C19ORF66 appeared in our comparative RNA-seq as the top 156 escapee in all the replicates and with all the endonucleases tested. We first evaluated whether 157 this transcript contained a putative SRE-like element in its 3'UTR by testing whether it could 158 protect the GFP mRNA, which is normally susceptible to viral endonuclease cleavage. We fused 159 the C19ORF66 3' UTR to GFP (C19-3'UTR) and found that it was sufficient to confer protection 160 from SOX and other viral endonucleases in transfected 293T cells (Fig. 3A) . Thus, similar to 161 All rights reserved.

As we previously demonstrated, there is no significant sequence conservation 164 between the 3'UTRs of these known dominant escapees. However, the highest similarities were 165 located near the second half of C19ORF66 3'UTR, and RNAfold secondary structure prediction 166 of this UTR section revealed a long stem-loop structure with a bulge in the middle, consistent 167 with previously found SRE structures (Fig. S3) . 168\n\nBecause C19ORF66 expression was previously shown to be increased in the context of 169 various viral infections, we next sought to investigate its expression upon KSHV lytic reactivation 170 when host shutoff occurs. iSLK.219 cells were reactivated and total protein harvested at various 171 time points over the course of 96 hours. C19ORF66 expression was increased upon KSHV lytic 172 reactivation and continued to accumulate over time (Fig. 3B) . Various other proteins were also 173 previously shown to change subcellular localization in response to host shutoff (45), so we 174 proceeded to monitor C19ORF66 expression and did not find differential shuttling upon KSHV 175 lytic reactivation (Fig. 3C) . Thus, C19ORF66 escapes SOX degradation by encoding an SRE-176 like element on its 3' UTR that allows it to escape host shutoff and accumulate in lytically 177 infected cells. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/506410 doi: bioRxiv preprint PAN promoter (Fig. 4A) . siRNA-mediated depletion of C19ORF66 in iSLK.219 cells during 187 latency and at 48h and 72h post-reactivation was efficient, reducing expression levels by 94.6%, 188 97% and 97.8%, respectively (Fig. 4B) . 72h hours post-reactivation, GFP and RFP positive cells 189\n\nwere analyzed by fluorescence microscopy in siRNA C19ORF66-treated cells (or siRNA 190 Control). C19ORF66 depletion resulted in a marked increase in the number of RFP positive 191 cells (Fig. 4C) . Conversely, overexpression of C19ORF66 in these cells (Fig. 4D ) resulted in 192 almost no RFP detection (Fig. 4C) . Taken together, these results suggest that C19ORF66 193 expression negatively regulates the progression of KSHV life cycle. 194\n\nWe next hypothesized that the reactivation defect due to C19ORF66 expression may 195 lead to restriction of the formation of viral particles. To test this, we performed a supernatant 196 transfer assay (Fig. 5A) . iSLK.219 cells were treated with siRNA C19ORF66 (or control siRNA) 197\n\nand reactivated for 72h. Supernatants containing GFP expressing KSHV virions were collected 198 and used to spinfect 293T cells (Fig. 5B) . 24h later, we observed a higher number of GFP KSHV life cycle, we next assessed whether C19ORF66 also affects viral gene expression. 202\n\nUsing RT-qPCR, we quantified the expression of several KSHV viral genes. Viral gene 203 expression in KSHV unfolds as a cascade with the \"early\" (E) genes expressed right after lytic 204 reactivation, followed by \"delayed early\" (DE) genes and finally, after viral replication, the \"late\" 205 (L) genes. We harvested timepoints from 0 to 72h after iSLK.219 reactivation and measured 206 RNA levels of genes representative of each gene class upon knock-down of C19ORF66. We 207 observed a shift in viral gene expression with early and delayed early viral genes -but not with 208 the late gene -which were expressed earlier and at higher levels in the C19ORF66 knocked 209 down cells as measured by RT-qPCR (Fig. 5C-E) . Taken together, these results suggest that 210 All rights reserved.

We hypothesize that these may contain similar RNA escape elements 228 as the one we previously characterized in IL-6 and GADD45B and therefore could be important 229 regulators of the viral-host interplay. IL-6 and GADD45B escape elements (referred to as SRE 230 and G-SRE respectively) were shown to adopt a specific secondary structure that we 231 hypothesized to be crucial in recruiting host protein to the 3'UTR of these escaping transcripts 232\n\n(19). This RNA-protein protective complex appears to be composed of core proteins as well as 233 accessory proteins that may be transcript-dependent. One future goal is thus to expand our 234 knowledge of the known escapees by exploring the RNA-protein complexes on these newly 235 All rights reserved.

More globally, determining whether such RNA elements impact 237 RNA fate in uninfected cells will also be key in deciphering their role. To date, no such RNA 238 elements have been found in viral genes, suggesting that this could be a cell specific 239 mechanism that has evolved in response to viral infection. 240\n\nNo common functions were enriched in the pool of escaping transcripts, rendering it 241 difficult to make any definite conclusion on whether these mRNAs escape degradation to benefit 242 the host or the virus. Instead, we hypothesize that these spared mRNAs may have both pro and 243\n\nanti-viral functions. Furthermore, because of the large diversity of hosts infected by members of 244 the herpesviridae, it would be interesting to investigate whether the orthologs of the escaping 245 transcripts in other species also contain these RNA escape elements. 246\n\nHere, we also characterized the top escaping transcript in our screen, C19ORF66. 247\n\nThrough knock down and overexpression assays, our data indicate that C19ORF66 is restricting 248 expression of KSHV early and delayed early genes, resulting in lower levels of viral reactivation 249 and reduced yield of infectious viral particles. C19ORF66 is known to be upregulated in 250 response to type I and type II IFNs (50,51) and to be upregulated in response to infection by a 251 number of unrelated viruses (35-42). Furthermore, C19ORF66 was found to interact with the 252 NS3 protein of Hepatitis C Virus (52), localize to the replication complex of DENV [33], and 253 occasionally co-localize in the cytoplasmic compartment with HIV-1 Rev and Tat proteins (40), 254 pointing to a potential conserved role for C19ORF66 as a key player in the host-pathogen 255 response. While it is still unclear how C19ORF66 participates in the regulation of these viruses, 256\n\nit was hypothesized that it may be mediated through its interaction with PABPC and LARP, two 257 major RNA binding proteins (43). PABPC and LARP were recently shown to be relocated upon 258 SOX-induced widespread RNA decay and to be linked to the transcription feedback loop that 259 occurs during host shutoff (45). PABPC in particular, was shown to be pivotal in triggering 260 All rights reserved.

Intriguingly, the viral endonucleases tested in this study come from both related and 276 unrelated viruses, do not share the same targeting elements on their target mRNA, and are not 277 known to be recruited to mRNA through similar pathways. It is thus notable that within the group 278 of common escapees was one with a conserved anti-viral role. This underscores the utility of 279 comparative approaches towards revealing broad regulators of viral infection. 280 281 Finally, none of the 3 known SREs (in IL-6, GADD45B, and now in C19ORF66) share 282 significant sequence similarity, although they do all share similar predicted secondary 283 structures. Thus, as predicted before, these RNA elements may function as scaffolds for 284 recruiting a protective protein complex. Therefore, by manipulating the sequence of these RNA 285 All rights reserved.
