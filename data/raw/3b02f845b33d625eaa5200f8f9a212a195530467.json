{"title": "Journal Pre-proof An insightful recollection since the distorted key theory was born about 23 years ago", "body": "Human immunodeficiency virus infection or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Over the last two decades or so, many efforts have been made to study the protein cleavage sites by HIV protease (see, e.g., and SARS coronavirus main proteinase [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] ). Now it has become very clear that the motivation driving the aforementioned studies is quite wise, and that the results acquired through these studies are very rewarding. Without losing generality, below let us consider the case of HIV protease.\n\nFunctioning as a dimmer of two identical subunits, HIV protease has a crab-like shape ( Fig.1 ). Its catalytic cleft is gated by a pair of flaps (or pincers if viewed as a crab). When the enzyme is in an inhibitor-free state, the pincer-gate is open, allowing substrates to enter the catalytic cleft ( Fig.1) ; when in an inhibitor-binding state, the pincer-gate is closed, blocking the entrance.\n\nAs a member of the aspartyl proteases, HIV protease is highly substrate-selective and cleavage-specific. Its susceptible sites in a protein extend to an octapeptide region (Fig.2) .\n\nAccording to Fisher's \"lock and key\" model [40] , Koshland's \"induced fit\" theory [40] , and the \"rack mechanism\" [41] , the prerequisite condition for a peptide to be cleaved by the disease-causing enzyme is a good fit and tightly binding with the enzyme's active site (Fig.2) . However, such a peptide, after a modification on its scissile bond with some simple chemical procedure, will no longer be cleavable by the enzyme but it can still tightly bind to its active site. An illustration about the distorted key theory is given in Fig.3 , where panel (a) shows an effective binding of a cleavable peptide to the active site of HIV protease, while panel (b) the peptide has become a non-cleavable one after its scissile bond is modified although it can still bind to the active site. Such a modified peptide, or ''distorted key\", will automatically become an inhibitor candidate against HIV protease.\n\nEven for non-peptide inhibitors, the information derived from the cleavable peptides can also provide useful insights about the key binding groups and fitting conformation in the sense of microenvironment. Besides, peptide drugs usually have no toxicity in vivo under the physiological concentration [28] .\n\nFor more discussion about the distorted key theory, see a comprehensive review paper [42] .\n\nIt was based on such a distorted key theory that many investigators were enthusiastic to develop various methods for predicting the protein cleavage sites by disease-causing enzymes (see, e.g., [5, 6, 11, 13, 16, 21, 28, 30, 37, [43] [44] [45] [46] and analyze them from the codon usage approach [47] [48] [49] [50] ). Functioning as a dimmer of two identical subunits, HIV protease has a crab-like shape. Its catalytic cleft is gated by a pair of flaps (or pincers if viewed as a crab). When the enzyme is in an inhibitor-free state, the pincer-gate is open, allowing substrates to enter the catalytic cleft; when in an inhibitor-binding state, the pincer-gate is closed, blocking the entrance.
