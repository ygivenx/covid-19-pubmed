{"title": "", "body": "veals the epidemic in Hubei is much more serious than that in the other areas of China. On the hand, it states the strict quarantine and limitation on population mobility have effectively prevented outbreaks in other provinces of China.\n\nWe use function h (t) = A (1 + e \u2212kx ) \u22121 \u2212 (1 + e k \u2212kx ) \u22121 to describe the data of daily infections and deaths in Hubei, where x = (t + 0 . 5 \u2212 t T ) with t denoting the day, and t T representing the turning point; A and k are the parameters and determined by the data together with t T . The cumulative data of infections or deaths are obtained by the integration over h ( t ). For the epidemic in the other areas of China, the data of infections shows an asymmetric character, and then will be described as\n\nwhere x = t \u2212 t T ; the parameters B, k 1 , and k 2 together with t T , are then determined by fitting to the data. Fig. 2 shows the fit and trend predictions to the total infections and deaths in Hubei and China other than Hubei. The extracted turning point of the infections in Hubei is the 17th day, namely, Feb. 6, 2020. The epidemic in Hubei is predicted to end after Mar. 10, 2020. We estimated that the epidemic is to end up with a total of 39, 0 0 0 infections in Hubei, not including the clinically diagnosed cases since Feb. 12, which may enlarge the prediction by 1.4 times. With considered data, namely, data from Jan. 20 to Feb. 11, the average errors are bout 166 and 190 for the fits to describe the daily and cumulative infections in Hubei, respectively, corresponding to 8.6% and 1.6% for the average relative errors, respectively. Fig. 2 (b) and (e) shows the estimations of the total and daily deaths in Hubei. The predicted turning point is Feb. 12, 2020. The total deaths is estimated to be 2250. Notice the distribution of the daily deaths is delayed about 5 \u223c6 days compared with the that of the daily infections. The average errors are bout 4 and 22 for the model to describe the daily and cumulative death numbers, respectively, corresponding to the relative errors 8.6% and 6.2%, respectively.\n\nThe numbers of the daily and total infections in China other than Hubei are showed in Fig. 2 (c) and 2 (f), respectively. The extracted turning point is Feb. 1, 2020 and the epidemic is expected to end on the 45th day, namely, on Mar. 5, 2020. The estimated number of cumulative infections is about 12,600 in China other than Hubei. With the data in the considered period, the average errors are bout 41 and 58 for this model to describe the daily and total cumulative infections, and the corresponding relative errors are about 8.4% and 1.2%, respectively. Due to the minority of the statistical data in deaths of China other than Hubei (45 until Feb. 11, 2020, see Fig. 1 (f)), we did not parameterize this data, and hence did not give a trend prediction.\n\nThe strategies to reduce human exposure taken in China, such as limitation on population mobility and interpersonal contact rates, strict quarantine on migrants, have already had good impacts on control of the epidemic. Now the outbreak and deaths of the COVID-19 epidemic are mainly in Hubei province. After this letter has been written, the Hubei reported 14,840 confirmed infections (including 13,332 clinically diagnosed cases) on Feb. 12, 2020, which is almost 9 times greater than the data of the previous day. The huge fluctuation is due to the changing of diagnostic criteria in Hubei. And this clinical criteria taken in Hubei is expected to play an active and important role in controlling the outbreak and death rate. \n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest."}
