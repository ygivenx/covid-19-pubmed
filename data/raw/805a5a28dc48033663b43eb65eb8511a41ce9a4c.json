{"title": "A continuous epitope from transmissible gastroenteritis virus S protein fused to E. coli heat-labile toxin B subunit expressed by attenuated Salmonella induces serum and secretory immunity", "body": "mortality approaches 100% (Saif and Wesley, 1992) . TGEV spike protein (S) is the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies (Garwes et al., 1978; Jim6nez et al., 1986; Laude et al., 1986) . In this protein four antigenic sites (A, B, C and D) have been defined (Delmas et al., 1986; Jim6nez et al., 1986; Correa et al., 1988; Correa et al., 1990; Delmas et al., 1990) , site A being antigenically dominant. Sites A and D, and to a minor extent site B, have been involved in the neutralization of TGEV (Delmas et al., 1986; Jim6nez et al., 1986) . Sites A and B are conformational and glycosylation dependent, while sites C and D are continuous and glycosylation independent, although a small effect of glycosylation has been observed in site D Correa et al., 1990; Posthumus et al., 1990a; Posthumus et al., 1990b; Gebauer et al., 1991) .\n\nPassive immunity is of primary importance in providing newborn piglets with immediate protection against TGEV infection (Saif and Wesley, 1992) . This type of protection can be achieved by the induction of lactogenic immunity (Hooper and Haelterman, 1966; Stone et al., 1977; Wesley et al., 1988; de Diego et al., 1992) , which can be stimulated by presentation of selected antigens to the immune system in gut associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) (Montgomery et al., 1974) . One possible approach to deliver antigens to the GALT is the use of vectors with tropism for Peyer's patches, such as Salmonella . S. typhimuriumzlcyaAcrp mutants, which are deficient in the synthesis of adenylate cyclase and the cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP), are both avirulent and immunogenic in orally immunized mice and swine, while retaining their ability to colonize and persist in the GALT (Curtiss and Kelly, 1987; Coe and Wood, 1992) . The expression of heterologous antigens as fusion products with E. coli heat-labile toxin B subunit (LT-B) in attenuated Salmonella has been described as an optimal strategy for the induction of secretory immunity against foreign proteins (Pierce et al., 1980; Spangler, 1992) . LT consists of 5 non-covalently bound B subunits and 1 A subunit. The non-toxic B subunits are responsible for binding the protein to GM 1 ganglioside located on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells, while the A subunit bears enzymatic activity. LT and its B subunits are potent oral immunogens which can function also as oral adjuvants eliciting high-titer serum and secretory antibodies when administered into the gut (Houghten et al., 1985; Lipscombe et al., 1991) . Several asd \u00f7 LT-B \u00f7 plasmids allowing fusions of foreign genes to the C terminus of LT-B have been constructed (Jagusztyn-Krynicka et al., 1993) . The asd \u00f7 plasraids ensure stable in vivo maintenance in attenuated Aasd S. typhimurium vaccine strains in the absence of external selection. This is because the Aasd mutation confers a requirement for diaminopimelic acid (DAP) (which is not present in animals), such that loss of the vector leads to cell death (Nakayama et al., 1988; Galfin et al., 1990) .\n\nA short sequence representing site D from TGEV S protein was chosen to be fused to the LT-B gene. Several continuous epitopes have been identified in TGEV S protein, but only antigenic site D has shown to be critical in neutralization (Posthumus et al., 1990a; Gebauer et al., 1991; Lenstra et al., 1992) . Site D has been identified between residues 378 395 of the S protein measuring the binding of specific MAbs to short overlapping peptides derived from the S amino acid sequence (the PEPSCAN method) (Posthumus et al., 1990a; Gebauer et al., 1991) . Antigenic site D elicits antibodies with four epitope specificities defined by MAbs 1D.G3, 8D.H8, 57.57 and 57.51 (S~inchez et al., 1990; Posthumus et al., 1990a) . All TGEV strains that have been tested maintain one or more of these epitopes, which makes unlikely the appearance of escaping mutants for all the epitopes in one virion. In this work, the construction of attenuated S. ty-phimuriumAcyaAcrp vectors expressing TGEV site D sequences as fusion products with LT-B and their potential use as bivalent oral vaccines is described.\n\nIn previous experiments we have shown that synthetic peptide D containing the sequence of site D from TGEV S protein (CYTVSDSSFF-SYGEIPFGVTDGPRYC) induced TGEV specific neutralizing antibodies when subcutaneously inoculated into rabbits . This peptide includes residues 373-398 of TGEV S protein and contains the core sequence SFF-SYGEI recognized by neutralizing MAbs specific for site D of the S protein (Posthumus et al., 1990a) . It was of interest to determine if site D would also elicit TGEV specific antibodies in swine, since this animal is the objective of a potential TGEV vaccine. Peptide D was oxidized with (NH4)2CO 3 to form cyclic monomers via a disulfide bridge between the N-and C-terminal cysteines and used to immunize rabbits and swine without coupling to a carrier protein. Animals were subcutaneously inoculated with 400 /~g of peptide in Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) on day 1 and received subsequent boosters of 200/~ g of peptide on days 35 and 57. Samples of sera were taken on day 65 and assayed by RIA against TGEV and peptide D as described (Sanz et al., 1985) . Both rabbit and swine sera bound to the synthetic peptide D and to TGEV (Table 1) . All the animals seroconverted. Furthermore, the specific TGEV antibodies raised in both animal species had neutralizing activity against the virus. Neutralization index was measured as previously Table 1 TGEV and peptide D specific antibody titers and neutralization index in sera from peptide D immunized animals a aTwo-month old rabbits (New Zealand White) and 2-month old haplotype defined miniature swine (Sachs et al., 1976) were used. bSamples of sera (day 65) were pooled in each case (n = 3). CRIA titer is expressed as the -log~o of the last dilution that bound 3-fold the background radioactivity. dNeutralization index was determined by dividing the number of PFU of virus per ml mixed with non-immune serum by the number of PFU of virus per ml in the presence of immune serum. N.I. is expressed as the lOglo of this ratio.\n\ndescribed (Jim6nez et al., 1986) . Both for the neutralization and RIA assays the strain PUR46-MAD of TGEV was used (S~nchez et al., 1990) . LT-B was selected to be fused to site D sequence to enhance the immunogenicity of this epitope for oral administration. It was also of interest to express multiple repeats of site D fused to LT-B to increase the immunogenicity of this epitope. Two synthetic complementary oligonucleotides encoding residues 371-400 of TGEV S protein, corresponding to site D sequence, were hybridized, cloned into the asd + LT-B expression plasmid pYA3048 (asd + LT-B +) (Jagusztyn- Krynicka et al., 1993) , and electroporated into the restriction negative, modification positive strain S. typhimurium hsdLT hsdSA hsdSB Aasd Z3730 (pYA232) . The vector:insert ratio used in the ligation was 1:10 in order to obtain a collection of recombinant plasmids in which the LT-B genes were fused to a variable number of sequences of site D combined in the two possible orientations. The nucleotide sequence of site D that was cloned (5'-ATCTCCT-GTTACACCGTTTCCGACTCCTCCTTCTTCT-CCTACGGTGAAATCCCGTTCGGTGTTAC-CGACGGTCCGCGTTACTGCTACGTT-3') was not exactly the same as that of the S gene from TGEV genome, since some triplets present in the viral sequence were substituted for other synonymous triplets of high frequency of use in Enterobacteriaceae. The fusion of site D sequence to LT-B was done to the carboxyl end of this molecule through a linker coding for 6 amino acids containing two prolines, in order to preserve the molecular properties of LT-B, such as pentamerization and GM1 binding (Jagusztyn- Krynicka et al., 1993) .\n\nTransformants were induced with isopropyl fl-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) 1 mM and screened by colony blot using a mixture of MAbs specific for site D. Recombinant plasmids expressing LTB-site D fusions were designated pYALTB-D and classified into 6 families according to the molecular mass of the expression product (Fig.  1A) . The families were designated pYALTB-D I-VI, pYALTB-D I being the plasmid encoding the smallest expression product (15 kDa) and pYALTB-D VI the one encoding the largest re- I I combinant product (30 kDa). The ability of these recombinant products to form pentamers was analyzed by Western blot using samples that had not been previously heated (pentamers dissociate into constituent monomers only after heating to > 70\u00b0C). Fusion proteins expressed by pYALTB-D I, III, V and VI kept their ability to form heat-labile oligomers (pentamers) (Fig. 1B) . However, products from pYALTB-D II and IV did not form oligomers. Plasmids pYALTB-D I-VI were sequenced to determine the structure of the 6 recombinant LTB-site D products (Fig. 1C) . Plasmids pYALTB-D I-III contained one single site D sequence in the right orientation while pYALTB-D IV, V and VI contained two fight oriented site D sequences. Recombinant products pYALTB-D II and IV, which did not form oligomers, had in common the expression of one site D reverse sequence at the carboxyl end of the chimerical protein.\n\nThe immunogenicity of LTB-site D expression products was also determined. The fusion product encoded, by pYALTB-D V was selected to study its immunogenicity since it has shown to be the most antigenic by Western blot. pYALTB-D V expression product was partially purified from a saturated culture of S. typhimurium Z 3730 (pYALTB-D) V induced with IPTG. The purification was carried out by (NH4)2SO 4 precipitation and preparative PAGE-SDS ( Fig. 2A) . Rabbits were inoculated with 150 /~g of partially purified recombinant product that was distributed by subcutaneous, intradermal and intramuscular routes. Animals received a first dose of antigen emulsified in FCA and subsequent boosters on days 17 and 32 with antigen emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA). Sera from day 39 (from 3 animals) were analyzed by RIA against TGEV, syn-thetic peptide D and LT. All inoculated animals developed serum antibodies that at day 39 bound to TGEV, peptide D and LT. These sera also showed neutralizing activity against TGEV. RIA titers and neutralization index (N.I.) for pooled sera are shown in Table 2 .\n\nPlasmid pYALTB-D V was electroporated into the attenuated S. typhimuriumAcyaAcrpAasd 3(3987 (Curtiss and Kelly, 1987) strain in order to obtain recombinant vectors constitutively expressing LTB-site D hybrid proteins. Transformants were selected by plating on LB agar without DAP and constitutive expression of the recombinant product was studied by Western blot analysis using site D-specific MAbs. S. typhimurium Z3987 (pYALTB-D) V selected colonies showed a similar level of LTB-site D expression than that observed in the inducible strain Z3730. The recombinant product expressed constitutively, also associated to form heat-labile oligomers (Fig.  2B) .\n\nThe stability of the expression of Z3987 (pYALTB-D) V was studied in vitro. Recombinant bacteria were grown during 50 generations and a representative number of colonies was analyzed at 25 and 50 generations. In these colonies the expression of the recombinant product was determined by Western blot using site D-specific MAbs. Recombinant S. typhimurium X 3987 (pYALTB-D) V showed a high degree of stability in vitro, since 100% of the bacteria analyzed after 50 generations maintained the expression of the recombinant product. Z3987 (pYALTB-D) V was selected to be tested as a bivalent vector to induce immunity against Salmonella and TGEV.\n\nA group of rabbits were orally inoculated with S. typhimurium ;(3987 (pYALTB-D) V. Control animals were orally inoculated with S. typhimurium X3987 (pYA3048). An RIA assay was aTwo-month old rabbits (New Zealand White) were used. bSamples of sera (day 39) were pooled in each case (n = 3). cControl animals were immunized with an equivalent amount of material electroluted from polyacrylamide containing no protein emulsified in FCA (first dose) or FIA (boosters). dRIA titer is expressed as described in Table 1 . eNeutralization index was determined as described in Table 1 . Reported values are the mean _+ standard deviation of RIA titers from the two animals that responded to TGEV (or from animals used as controls). RIA titers were determined as described in Table 1 . Symbols: 0 IgG and 0 IgA response in rabbits immunized with S. typhimurium Z3987 (pYA3048), respectively; 0 IgG and 0IgA response in rabbits immunized with S. typhimurium ;(3987 (pYALTB-D) V.\n\nPlates were blocked by adding 200 /tl of 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS to each well and incubating for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Fifty pl of several dilutions of sera or intestinal secretion from the inoculated rabbits were added to wells and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. Direct incubation with 125I-labeled protein A was used to determine the IgG response. Duplicates of the intestinal secretion samples were incubated with goat anti-rabbit sIgA (Cappel) as a second antibody prior to incubation with 125I-labeled protein G in order to determine the IgA response. One third of the rabbits that received the recombinant bacteria showed TGEV specific antibodies in both serum and intestinal secretion ( Fig. 3A and Fig.  3B ), indicating that both systemic and secretory immunity had been induced in these animals. In serum the response was of the IgG isotype, while in intestinal secretion only IgA was induced. The antibodies induced in intestinal secretion showed a neutralization index of one logarithmic unit above the control, while in serum no neutralizing activity was detected, probably due to the low antibody titer. Samples of intestinal secretions were diluted 1:10 in PBS supplemented with fetal calf serum 2% and used in the neutralization assay as it has been previously described (Jim6nez et al., 1986) . Both strains of bacteria used in the experiment also induced Salmonella specific antibodies in serum and secretions of all the inoculated animals (results not shown) In this study, recombinant bacteria expressing a TGEV epitope fused to LT-B has induced antibodies that recognize viral particles in orally inoculated rabbits. A similar epitope derived from site D fused to E. coli CS31 capsule-like antigen also induced TGEV specific antibodies when the purified recombinant product was used to immunize mice. Live bacteria expressing this hybrid protein, however, failed to induce antibodies that recognized virus particles when inoculated intraperitoneally in mice (Bousquet et al., 1994 ). An effective vaccine against TGE requires the induction of secretory immunity in swine. The recombi-nant vectors tested in this work induced a TGEV neutralizing response in intestinal secretions which makes them suitable candidates to be tested as oral vaccines in swine. The immunogenicity of these recombinant vectors in orally inoculated swine will be investigated using containment facilities for large animals with a P3 safety level."}
