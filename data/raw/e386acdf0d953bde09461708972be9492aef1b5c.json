{"title": "[2] FAMILIES OF SERINE PEPTIDASES 19 [2] Families of Serine Peptidases", "body": "Proteolytic enzymes dependent on a serine residue for catalytic activity are widespread and very numerous. Serine peptidases are found in viruses (Table I) , bacteria, and eukaryotes, and they include exopeptidases, endopeptidases, oligopeptidases, and omega peptidases.\n\nBy the criteria we use to distinguish families of peptidases (see [1] in this volume), over 20 families of serine peptidases are recognized (Table  II) . On the basis of three-dimensional structures, and some less direct evidence, most of these families can be grouped together into about six clans that may well have common ancestors. The structures that are known for members of four of the clans, chymotrypsin, subtilisin, carboxypeptidase C, and Escherichia D-AIa-D-AIa peptidase A, show them to be totally unrelated, however. We therefore envisage at least four separate evolutionary origins of serine peptidases, and suspect that there were considerably more.\n\nThere are similarities in the reaction mechanisms for several of the peptidases with different evolutionary origins. Thus, the peptidases of the chymotrypsin, subtilisin, and carboxypeptidase C clans have in common a \"catalytic triad\" of the three amino acids: serine (nucleophile), aspartate (electrophile), and histidine (base). The geometric orientations of these are closely similar between families, despite the fact that otherwise the protein folds are quite different. This striking example of convergent evolution has led researchers to look for the same catalytic residues in other serine peptidases. However, the catalytic mechanisms of clans SE* (Escherichia D-Ala-D-Ala peptidase A) and SF (repressor LexA) are already known to be very different, and there is little doubt that some of the other [13] in Volume 248 of this series. All of the peptidases known to be encoded by viruses are endopeptidases, and it will be noted that there is no metallopeptidase among them.\n\nfamilies of serine peptidases also will prove to have distinctive mechanisms of action, without the \"classic\" Ser, His, Asp triad. The arrangements of the catalytic residues in the linear sequences of members of the various families commonly reflect their relationships at the clan level (Table II) .\n\nThe way in which certain glycine residues tended to be conserved in The order in which the families are listed here is that in which they are to be found in the text. The arrangement of catalytic residues in the representative enzymes is illustrated diagrammatically by use of lines of normalized length to depict the polypeptide chains, although in reality the chains vary considerably in length, of course. For some of the families, catalytic residues remain to be identified.\n\nthe vicinity of the catalytic serine residue in the first serine peptidases to be sequenced, to form the motif Gly-Xaa-Ser-Yaa-Gly I led to an early expectation that this motif would be found in all serine peptidases. Though it is true that most of the families do show conserved glycine residues near the essential serine, the exact positions of these are variable, as is shown in Fig. 1 .\n\nAs is shown in Table II , we include I0 families in clan SA, and all the active members of these families are endopeptidases. For the families of chymotrypsin (S 1), a-lyric endopeptidase ($2), Sindbis virus core endopeptidase ($3), and Achromobacter lysyl endopeptidase ($5), the three- Table II. peptidase ($30) have the same order of catalytic residues as chymotrypsin.\n\nThe Neisseria IgA-specific serine endopeptidase ($6), hepatitis C virus NS3 endopeptidase ($29), cattle diarrhea virus p80 endopeptidase ($31), and equine arteritis virus putative endopeptidase ($32) show somewhat similar sequences around the catalytic serine residues, so these families are included with a lower degree of confidence.\n\nThe order of catalytic residues in the polypeptide chain in clan SA is His/Asp/Ser, and Fig. 2 shows sequences around these catalytic residues for selected members of the clan.\n\nThe members of the chymotrypsin family (Table III) are almost entirely confined to animals. The exceptions are trypsin-like enzymes from actinomycetes of the genera Streptomyces (TRYP_STRGR) and Saccharopolyspora (TRYP_SACER), as well as one recently sequenced from the fungus Fusarium oxysporum (EMBL : $63827). The members of this family are inherently secreted proteins. Each is synthesized with a signal peptide that targets it to the secretory pathway. The animal enzymes may be secreted directly (e.g., proenzymes of coagulation factors in the liver parenchymal cell), or packaged in vesicles for regulated secretion (e.g., chymotrypsinogen in the pancreas), or they may be retained in leukocyte granules (e.g., elastase, chymase, or granzymes in polymorphonuclear leukocytes, mast cells, or cytotoxic lymphocytes, respectively). Proteolytic activation of the proenzymes occurs extracellularly, or sometimes in storage organelles. Functions are occasionally intracellular, as in intracellular digestion of bacteria by neutrophils, but most commonly extracellular. Examples of extracellular functions are digestion of food proteins in the intestine by the enzymes from the pancreas, and coagulation, fibrinolysis, and complement activation by the enzyme systems in the plasma.\n\nThere are about 200 complete amino acid sequences known, more than for any other family of peptidases. Most enzymes are monomers, but granzyme A is a disulfide-bonded homodimer (see [4] ), and tryptase is a homotetramer (see [6] ).\n\nThe essential catalytic unit of these peptidases is a polypeptide chain of about 220 amino acid residues. However, many members of the family are mosaic proteins in which the molecule is extended N-terminally by addition of unrelated peptide segments (Fig. 3) . The catalytic unit almost invariably forms the C-terminal domain: only acrosin and complement The propeptide maintaining the proenzyme in its inactive state can be as small as two amino acid residues, as in cathepsin G 5 and granzyme B (see [5]), but many are much longer. Not uncommonly, these are disulfide bonded to the catalytic domain, so that they remain part of the active enzyme. These N-terminal extensions often contain one or more copies of several domains with different structures (Table IV) . Domains such as \"kringles\" and \"apples\" are confined to this family of proteins, but others, such as \"sushi\" and epidermal growth factor-like domains, are widely distributed among protein families. One domain is found not only in the chymotrypsin family (complement subcomponents Clr and Cls) but also in the astacin family of metallopeptidases.6 The process by which so much \"exon shuffling\" has occurred in this family has been suggested to depend heavily on a conserved phase 1 intron N-terminal to the peptidase domain. 7 A surprising feature of the genes for peptidases of the chymotrypsin family is the diversity of codons used for the active site serine residue. The six available codons for serine fall into two groups (TCA, TCG, TCT, TCC vs. AGC, AGT) such that interconversion between groups requires \n\nCoagulation factor XII I 1 -- \n\nHowever, all six codons are used for active site serine residues in the chymotrypsin family; the most common are from the TCX set, but hepsin, plasmin, thrombin, coagulation factor IX, protein C, and complement components Clr and Cls have AGT or AGC codons. Brenner I pointed out that codons in both groups can be derived from cysteine codons in a single step, and suggested that separate evolutionary lines of serine peptidases may have diverged from an ancestral cysteine peptidase. How-ever, our phylogenetic analysis suggests that the \"AGX\" members do not represent a monophyletic group, and that the change of codon usage has occurred independently several times. It is possible that the \"AGX\" members have evolved from \"TCX\" members via proteins without catalytic activity. Codons from both sets also occur in the catalytic serine in the a-lytic endopeptidase family ($2) of clan SA, as well as in two unrelated lines of serine peptidases, the families of prolyl oligopeptidase ($9) and carboxypeptidase C (S10).\n\nThe chymotrypsin family contains several proteins that lack peptidase activity. Among these, haptoglobin (HPT_RAT, HPTI_HUMAN, HPT2_HUMAN) has the active site His replaced by Lys, and the active site Ser by Ala, whereas the essential Asp residue is retained. In protein Z (PRTZ_*) and azurocidin (CAP7_*), both the active site Ser and His residues have been replaced. The complete triad is present in cattle procarboxypeptidase A subunit III (CAC3_BOVIN), and the inactivity of this has been attributed to lack of two N-terminal hydrophobic residues. 8 In rhesus monkey apolipoprotein (a) (APOA_MACMU) the active site Ser is replaced by Asn, but in the human protein (APOA_HUMAN) all three residues of the catalytic triad are present. The expected hydrophobic residues at positions 16 and 17 (chymotrypsinogen numbering) are also present in the human apolipoprotein, so that it has the appearance of a fully functional proenzyme. Conversion to an active peptidase would apparently require cleavage of a Serq-Ile bond, and proteolytic activity of apolipoprotein (a) has been reported. 9\n\nThe fact that members of family S1 occur in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes has been the subject of considerable debate. The actinomycete trypsins have sequences too similar to eukaryote trypsins to be consistent with a divergence 3500 million years ago, which is when the common ancestor of prokaryotes and eukaryotes is generally thought to have lived. Hartley 1\u00b0 attempted to explain this apparent anomaly in terms of a \"horizontal\" gene transfer from higher organisms to bacteria, whereas Young et al. 11 presented a dendrogram with bacterial sequences at the root, along with an estimate of divergence at about 1300 million years ago, and the implication that because this corresponded to the time that mitochondria were introduced into eukaryotes, a horizontal gene transfer had occurred. Our calculations confirm this date, and we suggest that the gene transfer is most likely to have been from the protomitochondrion to the eukaryote host.\n\nMembers of family $2 (listed in Table III ) are known only from eubacteria, and they are secreted to act extracellularly. For example, a-lytic endopeptidase produced by the soil bacterium Lysobacter degrades cell walls of other soil bacteria, allowing Lysobacter to feed on them. Like the chymotrypsin family, family $2 contains endopeptidases that show specificity for P1 residues that are basic, hydrophobic, or alanine, but in addition, the ot-lytic endopeptidase family includes several enzymes cleaving glutamyl bonds.\n\nThe endopeptidases of family $2 show only slight similarity in sequence to those of family S1, but James and co-workers lz prepared alignments based on the tertiary structures of the enzymes, and concluded that the small microbial enzymes had common ancestry with the more sophisticated pancreatic endopeptidases.\n\nThe recently determined sequences of protease Do from Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium show protease Do to be a distant homolog not only of ot-lytic endopeptidase but also of the glutamyl endopeptidase from Staphylococcus. Significant RDF scores are obtained between E. coli protease Do and Lysobacter ot-lytic endopeptidase (7.3) and between E. coli and Salmonella proteases Do and Staphylococcus epidermolytic toxin B (8.3 and 7.4, respectively).\n\nCrystallographic structures have been determined for ot-lytic endopeptidase, 13 streptogrisins A and B, 14' 15 and Streptomyces griseus glutamyl endopeptidase (see [8] ). The catalytic triad residues are included in the alignment of Fig. 2 , which also shows our prediction for the catalytic triad of protease Do. The mechanism of activation is not known for many peptidases in this family, but Lysobacter a-lytic endopeptidase is synthesized with a long propeptide, and the same apparently applies to Streptomyces glutamyl endopeptidase and Rarobacter protease I. Not all members of the family retain Asp-194, which is crucial to activity in family SI as described above. Although Ile-16 is conserved in a-lytic endopeptidase and the streptogrisins, it does not form an ion pair with Asp-194, and remains on the surface of the molecule. 12 As in family S1, the active site serine residues in family $2 are generally encoded by TCX codons, but the Bacillus enzymes and streptogrisin A use the AGX codons. 16' 17\n\nWe report here the existence of two homologs of protease Do from E. coli (EMBL : M24777) and Chlamydia trachomatis (EMBL : 31119). In both cases, the protease Do-like sequences are interrupted by frameshifts, but these may reflect sequencing errors. The E. coli partial sequence is on the strand complementary to that containing the gene for malate dehydrogenase, ~8 whereas the Chlamydia sequence is complementary to a gene that was proposed to be an open reading frame for a 59-kDa immunogenic protein. 19\n\nTogaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses ( Table I) , family C8), whereas p130 contains a serine endopeptidase. Polyprotein p130 also contains structural proteins for the nucleocapsid core and for the glycoprotein spikes that protrude from the lipid bilayer surrounding the core and carry the recognition site for the host cell receptor. The nucleocapsid core protein forms the N terminus of the p130 polyprotein, and is the serine endopeptidase. The cleavage of the polypeptide occurs at a Trp+Ser bond, and once the core protein is released, it retains no detected peptidase activity. Mutagenesis studies have identified a His/Asp/Ser catalytic triad in the core protein, and X-ray crystallography of the Sindbis virus core protein has shown a structure very similar to those of chymotrypsin and a-lytic endopeptidase. 2\u00b0\n\nThe active site serine is encoded by AGX codons in both Sindbis virus 21 and Semliki Forest virus. 2z\n\nThe recently determined tertiary structure of the lysyl endopeptidase from Achromobacter lyticus shows a clear similarity to that of trypsin (see [9] ), showing that the enzyme is a member of the chymotrypsin clan. The active site residues are shown in Fig. 2 . The salt bridge from the amino terminus to Asp-194 that is essential to the structure of the active site in the chymotrypsin family does not exist in lysyl endopeptidase, but a new disulfide bridge, Cys6-Cys 216, may serve a similar function (see [9] Inhibition characteristics identify the enzymes of Neisseria and Haemophilus as serine peptidases. They contain serine residues in sequences similar to that of chymotrypsin (Fig. 2) , and mutation of these inactivates the enzymes. 25\n\nThe precursor of the Neisseria enzyme is a mosaic protein of more than 1500 amino acid residues. The proprotein contains an N-terminal leader peptide that directs the protein to the periplasmic space and is removed by a leader peptidase. Following this, there is the peptidase domain, and then a C-terminal \"helper\" domain believed to create a pore \n\nThe tobacco etch virus is a potyvirus (Table I) , the polyprotein of which contains three proteinases, two of which are cysteine proteinases (see [32] , families C4 and C6). Most of the polyprotein processing is performed by the NIa cysteine proteinase, but one N-terminal cleavage (of a Tyr-l-Ser bond) is made by the 35-kDa serine endopeptidase. 27\n\nThe residues His-214, Asp-223, and Ser-256 are conserved in the family, and have been shown to be essential for activity by site-directed mutagenesis. 28 The His/Asp/Ser order of catalytic residues, and the sequence surrounding the catalytic Ser residues (Fig. 2) , are consistent with the inclusion of family $30 in the chymotrypsin clan of serine peptidases. His-214 and Asp-223 are much closer together than the corresponding residues in other peptidases of the clan, however (Table II) .\n\nFlaviviruses, which include dengue virus, yellow fever virus, and encephalitis viruses, are single-stranded RNA viruses (Table I) . The RNA encodes a single polyprotein, which is processed by a viral endopeptidase as well as by cellular enzymes. Unlike the Sindbis virus core endopeptidase, the flavivirus endopeptidase is a nonstructural (NS) protein, and occurs internally in the polyprotein, not at the end. The flavivirus endopeptidase cleaves on the C-terminal side of paired basic amino acids, and excises all the nonstructural proteins from the polyprotein. (Excision of structural proteins, which are at the N terminus of the polyprotein, is believed to be mediated eotranslationally by a host cell peptidase associated with the endoplasmic reticulum.) Endopeptidases with a specificity for cleaving C-terminally to paired basic residues are also found in family $8. His-53, Asp-77, and Ser-138 have been identified as the members of a catalytic triad in the yellow fever virus NS3 protein by site-directed mutagenesis 29 (Fig. 2) . The catalytic residues occur in the N-terminal half of protein NS3, the C-terminal half of which may be a helicase. It is notable that the serine endopeptidases of other enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses, in families $29, $31, and $32, also occur as N-terminal domains of proteins, the C-terminal parts of which are helicases.\n\nThe hepatitis C virus is a togavirus ( Table I) . The viral RNA encodes a polyprotein for nonstructural proteins, among which NS3 has been identified as a serine peptidase. Site-specific mutagenesis has implicated Ser-159 in the catalytic mechanism, and other members of a His/Asp/Ser catalytic triad have been proposed 3\u00b0 (Fig. 2) .\n\nPestiviruses, which include cattle diarrhea virus and hog cholera virus, are closely related to flaviviruses (Table I) . These are single-stranded RNA viruses, each of which encodes a large poly.protein. The p80 protein, which is approximately in the middle of the polyprotein, has been identified as the peptidase responsible for processing all nonstructural pestivirus proteins, and site-specific mutagenesis of Ser-311 (Ser-1842 in the polyprotein) prevented processingfl On the basis of sequence similarities to other serine peptidases that we place in clan SA, Bazan and Fletterick 32 correctly predicted the catalytic nature of the p80 protein of pestiviruses, and the active site serine. They also predicted a catalytic triad including His-217 and Asp-254 and proposed that the peptidase domain of the p80 protein would possess a fold similar to that of chymotrypsin.\n\nEquine arteritis virus, once thought to be a togavirus, is now regarded as more closely related to coronaviruses. The viral genome encodes several polyproteins, one of which includes a helicase and a polymerase, and is assumed also to contain a serine peptidase with a catalytic triad of His-1103, Asp-1129, and Ser-1184. 33\n\nClan SB: Subtilisin Family ($8)\n\nThe subtilisin family is the second largest family of serine peptidases so far identified, and is extremely widespread, members having been found in eubacteria, archaebacteria, eukaryotes, and viruses (Tables I and V) . The great majority of the enzymes are endopeptidases, but there is also a tripeptidyl-peptidase. Crystallographic structures have been determined for several members of the family, and these show a catalytic triad composed of the same residues as in peptidases of the chymotrypsin clan. However, these occur in a different order in the sequence (Asp/His/Ser), and the three-dimensional structures of the molecules bear no resemblance to that of chymotrypsin, so that it is clear that subtilisin and chymotrypsin are not evolutionarily related.\n\nThe proprotein-processing endopeptidases kexin, furin, and related enzymes, so far known from yeasts and animals, form a distinct subfamily, which we shall term the kexin subfamily (see [11]-[13]). These preferentially cleave C-terminally to paired basic amino acids. A member of the kexin subfamily can be identified from the subtly different motifs around the active site residues. As can be seen in Fig. 4, |n subtilisins, the oxyanion hole is formed by the active site Ser and Ash-262 (numbering according to preprosubtilisin BPN'). Unusually, in the mammalian furin known as PC2, Asn-262 is replaced by Asp (see [ll] ), and Asp-ll9 for Ash.\n\nThe alignment of the sequences (made by the PILEUP program 34) gives clues to the structural basis of the selectivity of the kexin subfamily for basic residues. Thus, acidic residues Glu-210 and Asp-273, which are found only in the kexins, occur in parts of the enzymes predicted to form the $2 and Sl binding pockets, respectively. Some members of the subtilisin family have a requirement for thiol activation. These include endopeptidases R, T, and K from the yeast Tritirachium, and the cuticle-degrading endopeptidase from Metarhizium, as well as the members of the kexin subfamily. This thiol dependence is attributable to Cys-173 near the active site histidine. 35\n\nIt has been thought that none of the bacterial subtilisins contains cysteine residues, 35 but the subtilisin from Bacillus smithii is an exception to this (EMBL : L24202).\n\nThe sole viral member of family $8 is a 56-kDa proteinase from the herpes virus 1 that infects the channel catfish. 36 Herpes viruses are related to baculoviruses, both of which groups encode proteins homologous to mammalian endopeptidases (Table I) . The catfish herpes virus is rather divergent, and its genome has a large insert containing some 65 extra open reading frames as compared to other a-herpes viruses. The gene encoding the putative peptidase is one of these, hence no homologs are found in other herpes viruses. This gene is presumably one \"captured\" from a host.\n\nThe subtilisin family contains some mosaic proteins. The secreted endopeptidases from Vibrio alginolyticus (known confusingly as \"exopeptidase A ''37) and Xanthomonas campestris contain homologous C-terminal domains similar to some found in metallopeptidases, including an aminopeptidase from Vibrio proteolyticus (family M28) and endopeptidases of the thermolysin family (M4). Homologs of subtilisin that are located in Family $8 contains several enzymes with N-or C-terminal extensions that show no relationship to other proteins. The kexin subfamily includes endopeptidases with a variety of C-terminal extensions (see [ 13] ). Tripeptidyl-peptidase II is a 135-kDa mammalian cytosolic enzyme active at neutral pH, which releases N-terminal tripeptides from polypeptides. The peptidase domain forms the N-terminal third of the protein, whereas the C-terminal two-thirds show no resemblance to any other protein. 38\n\nCarboxypeptidase Clan (SC) Tertiary structures available for enzymes of family S l0 (carboxypeptidase C) are of the \"a/fl-hydrolase fold\" type, also seen for a wide variety of other enzymes including acetylcholinestase, lipases and Xanthomonas haloalkanc dehalogenase. The sequence of Neisseria prolyl aminopeptidase (family $33) shows it to be homologous to the haloalkane dehalogenase, so we can conclude that families S10 and $33 have similar tertiary folds and linear arrangement of catalytic residues (Set/Asp/His), and form a clan (SC).\n\nThe distinctive Ser/Asp/His arrangement of catalytic residues is also found in family $9 (prolyl oligopeptidase) (Table II) , which raises the possibility that family $9 is also a member of clan SC. 39 The clan might additionally contain Lactococcus X-Pro-peptidase (family S15) and lysosomal Pro-X carboxypeptidase (family $28). 4\u00b0 In support of this, there is limited conservation of sequence around the active site Ser residues (Fig.  5 ), but this is not strong enough to be conclusive.\n\nAs we shall see, the peptidases of family $9 differ biologically from those of families S l0 and $28 in that the homologs of prolyl oligopeptidase are either cytosolic or integral mcmbrane proteins, whereas the carboxypeptidases are secreted or lysosomal enzymes. Also, peptidases of families $9 and S15 do not seem to have proenzymes, whereas those of S10 and $28 do.\n\nFamily $9 contains peptidases with a very varied range of quite restricted specificities (see 5 . Conservation of sequence around the catalytic triad residues in the families of prolyl oligopeptidase ($9), Lactococcus X-Pro-peptidase (S 15), carboxypeptidase C (S 10), lysosomal Pro-X carboxypeptidase ($28) and Neisseria prolyl aminopeptidase ($33) forming clan SC. Residues are numbered according to rat dipeptidyl-peptidase IV, and residues identical to those in that sequence are shown in white on black. Asterisks indicate the catalytic and presumed catalytic residues; those that have been identified with confidence are Ser, Asp, and His in families $9 and SI0. Key to sequences: 1, rat dipeptidyl-peptidase IV; 2, yeast dipeptidyl-peptidase B; 3, pig prolyl oligopeptidase; 4, Flaoobacterium meningosepticum prolyl oligopeptidase; 5, Escherichia coli oligopeptidase B; 6, pig acylaminoacylpeptidase; 7, human DNF 1552 protein (ACPH_HUMAN) otic and eukaryotic organisms (Table VI) . The family contains soluble as well as membrane-bound peptidases. The cytosolic enzymes include two oligopeptidases with different P1 specificities: prolyl oligopeptidase, which cleaves prolyl and some alanyl bonds (see [14] ), and oligopeptidase B from eubacteria, which cleaves arginyl and lysyl bonds (see [15] ).\n\nAcylaminoacyl-peptidase (see [17] ) is also a cytosolic enzyme that has been sequenced from mammals. The enzyme releases an N-acetyl or N-formyl amino acid from the N terminus of a peptide, and is thus an omega peptidase.\n\nThe active site Ser, Asp, and His residues have been identified in Fig. 5 . In all known members of the family these residues are within about 130 residues of the C terminus, and the N-terminal parts of the molecules are more or less variable. The membrane-bound members of this family contain membrane-spanning domains near the N terminus. Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV releases N-terminal dipeptides, preferentially cleaving prolyl bonds (see [16] ). It is an integral membrane glycoprotein of lymphocytes and intestinal brush border, in particular, that exists as a homodimer or homotetramer. An enzyme with similar specificity from the membrane of the yeast vacuole, dipeptidyl peptidase B, is involved in processing the a-mating factor precursor. 43 A notable feature of all members of this family is the lack of proteolytic processing, and the enzymes are apparently synthesized in active form. 44, 45 Presumably, their restricted specificities prevent indiscriminate degradation of other proteins.\n\nLike a number of other cytosolic oligopeptidases, including thimet oligopeptidase (family M3) and insulysin (MIr), prolyl oligopeptidase and acylaminoacyl-peptidase are thiol dependent, but dipeptidyl-peptidase IV is not. This mix of thiol-dependent and thiol-independent enzymes is also seen in families M3 and M16. Unusually for a serine peptidase, the active site serine of prolyl oligopeptidase reacts with diazomethanes, 44 but that of oligopeptidase B reportedly does not do so (see [15] ).\n\nTwo mammalian proteins, DPPX-S and DPPX-L, closely related to dipeptidyl-peptidase IV, have the catalytic Set replaced by Asp. mRNAs for both sequences are abundant in the brain, and that for DPPX-S is also found in kidney, ovary, prostate, and testis.46,47 To date, the corresponding proteins have not been isolated, but we should expect them to be inactive members of the family.\n\nThe carboxypeptidase C family includes carboxypeptidases that are unusual among serine-dependent enzymes in that they are maximally active at acidic pH. The members of the family are shown in Table VI . The family appears to be restricted to eukaryotes, and sequences are known for enzymes of protozoa, fungi, plants, and animals. These carboxypeptidases have a lysosomal distribution in animals, and in plants and fungi are found in vacuoles. The fungal and plant enzymes can be divided into variants of carboxypeptidase C (EC 3.4.16.5), with a preference for a hydrophobic amino acid in P1 ', and those of carboxypeptidase D (EC 3.4.16.6), which release a C-terminal arginine or lysine. However, this may represent an oversimplification of the specificities (see [18] ).\n\nThe mammalian enzyme is known as \"protective protein\" because it complexes/3-galactosidase and neuroaminidase in the lysosome, protecting them from proteolytic degradation. Its absence therefore leads to functional deficiency in these enzymes, and the lysosomal storage disease, galactosialidosis. The protein expresses the acid carboxypeptidase characteristics of other carboxypeptidase C forms, and there is little doubt that it is the enzyme originally known as cathepsin A, and subsequently as lysosomal carboxypeptidase A. 48 Like other carboxypeptidases C, it also exhibits deamidase and esterase activity. 49' 5\u00b0\n\nThe sequences around the catalytic Ser/Asp/His residues are shown in Fig. 5 . In all the peptidases, the residue preceding the catalytic Ser is a Glu residue that is believed to be responsible for the acidic pH optimum of the enzymes (see [18] ). The differences in substrate specificity between carboxypeptidases C and D have been attributed to two residues that are Glu in carboxypeptidase D but are both hydrophobic in character (Phe, Leu, or Met) in carboxypeptidase C (see [18] ).\n\nYeast carboxypeptidase Y (one of the C-type enzymes) is inhibited by p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, presumably because of the presence of the free thiol of Cys-341 in the S1 binding pocket. 5~ Consistent with the lysosomal/vacuolar location of the serine carboxypeptidases, they are synthesized with N-terminal signal peptides and propeptides.\n\nThe crystal structures of several members of the family have been determined (see [18] ). The fold of these proteins bears no relation to those of chymotrypsin, subtilisin, or D-Ala-D-Ala peptidases. However, the tertiary structures of serine carboxypeptidases do strongly suggest a distant relationship to a variety of nonpeptidase enzymes. The sequence relation- ship between human acetylcholinesterase and human protective protein, although distant, is statistically significant (RDF score = 6.75 SD units). In turn, cholinesterases are related to a wide range of enzymes and other proteins, including lipases and thyroglobulin, and form a distinct subfamily. 5z,53 The differences in sequence between the two subfamilies are too great for us to be able to estimate when the divergence occurred.\n\nThe relationship of the cholinesterases to the serine carboxypeptidases invites reconsideration of the long-standing controversy over possible endopeptidase activity of the cholinesterases. At the time of writing, however, the evidence for endopeptidase activity expressed by the cholinesterases does not appear strong. [54] [55] [56] The nonpeptidase enzymes that show no amino acid sequence similarity to carboxypeptidase C, but are thought to be distant relatives because of their similar tertiary structures, include cholinesterases, haloalkane dehalogenases, and carboxymethylenebutenolidases (dienelactone hydrolases) in the \"a/[3 hydrolase fold\" clan. 52,53\n\nThis family has only one known member, a carboxypeptidase specific for cleavage of prolyl bonds. Like members of the carboxypeptidase C family (S10), Pro-X carboxypeptidase has an acidic pH optimum, is lysosomal, and is synthesized with a signal peptide and propeptide. 4\u00b0 The suggestion has been made that lysosomal Pro-X carboxypeptidase is evolutionarily related to both carboxypeptidase C and prolyl oligopeptidase. 4\u00b0 Active site residues have not been biochemically identified for lysosomal Pro-X carboxypeptidase, but have been postulated to be Ser-134, Asp-333, and His-411 on the basis of similarities to the catalytic residues of carboxypeptidase C (Fig. 5) .4\u00b0 The glutamate residue preceding the active site serine in carboxypeptidase C, and believed to be responsible for the acidic pH optimum of carboxypeptidase activity (see [18] ), is replaced by Gly in lysosomal Pro-X carboxypeptidase, however (Fig. 5) .\n\nLactococcus lactis contains an enzyme known as \"X-prolyl dipeptidyl aminopeptidase\" with specificity similar to that of the mammalian dipeptidyl-peptidase IV, cleaving Xaa-Proq-peptide bonds to release N-terminal dipeptides. An indication of relationship of the Lactococcus enzyme to others in families $9, S10, or $28 is similarity of sequence in the vicinity of the catalytic Ser residue (Fig. 5) . s7 Like members of family $9, Lactococcus X-Pro-peptidase does not have a proenzyme, s8 and like dipeptidylpeptidase IV specifically, the Lactococcus enzyme exists as a homodimer. 59 Proposals regarding the catalytic Asp and His residues are made in [15] .\n\nProlyl aminopeptidase is a 35 kDa peptidase from Neisseria gonorrhoea that selectively hydrolyses N-terminal Pro residues. 6\u00b0 The amino acid sequence shows no relationship to that known for any other peptidase, but is homologous to those ofPseudomonas 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase (XYLF PSEPU), Xanthobacter haloalkane dehalogenase (HALO_XANAU), and human and rat epoxide hydrolase (HYEP_*). These enzymes, in turn, are known to be structurally related to acetylcholinesterase (ACES_*) and carboxypeptidase C (family $8). Most of the \"a/fl hydrolase fold\" enzymes have Ser at the active site, and prolyl aminopeptidase also has Ser at this position (Fig. 5) . Table III for explanation. free amino group of diaminopimelate. In the biosynthesis of the cell wall peptidoglycan the precursor has the four-residue structure above, but with an additional C-terminal D-alanine residue. The D-AIa-D-AIa transpeptidases and carboxypeptidases are involved in the metabolism of the cell wall components.61 Some of these peptidases are serine enzymes, whereas others have zinc at the catalytic center. 62 D-AIa-D-AIa peptidases are synthesized with leader peptides to target them to the cell membrane. The peptidases are retained in the membrane by a C-terminal membrane anchor, after removal of the leader peptide, except in Streptomyces K 15 transpeptidase (family S 11) and E. coli penicillin-binding protein 4 (family S13), in which a C-terminal propeptide is removed and where overexpression can lead to secretion of the enzymes into the medium. 62\n\nThe members of the three families of serine-type D-Ala-D-AIa peptidases are listed in Table VII . These enzymes are known as low molecular mass penicillin-binding proteins, and probably are distantly related to the high molecular mass penicillin-binding proteins (at the clan level). of fimbriae, which are external appendages found on the surface of gramnegative bacteria and used for cell adhesion. The fimbrial subunits that are related to D-AIa-D-Ala peptidases are found only in some strains, and seem to represent a recent lateral transfer of genes. The function of these proteins is unknown, but the active site motif Ser-Xaa-Xaa-Lys is retained.\n\nFamily S13 contains D-AIa-D-AIa peptidases from Actinomadura and E. coli. The E. coli enzyme is also known as penicillin-binding protein 4, and has been reported to have endopeptidase as well as carboxypeptidase activity. 69 Although no crystal structures are available for this family, conservation of sequences around the catalytic residues suggests similar tertiary structures and very distant evolutionary relationship to the other members of the proposed clan.\n\nAlthough the majority of serine peptidases contain catalytic triads of serine, histidine, and aspartic acid, the D-AIa-D-AIa peptidases show that this is not the only way in which a serine-dependent catalytic site can be 69 B. Korat, H. Mottl, and W. Keck, Mol. Microbiol. 5, 675 (1991).\n\nMore detailed descriptions of these families follow, but at this stage it may be useful to draw attention to the common features of the enzymes of the proposed clan. As shown in Fig. 7 , there are similarities in the sequences around the Ser and Lys residues that are known to have catalytic activity in families $24 and $26, and the Ser and His residues that may be equivalent in the eukaryotic signal peptidases ($27).\n\nThe properties of the catalytic serine residues in clan SF are dissimilar from those of serine residues in the \"catalytic triad\" peptidases of clans SA, SB, and SC. Thus, they show little or no reactivity with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) and other reagents commonly used for serine peptidases, and the serine can be replaced by cysteine with partial retention of activity (see prokaryotic and eukaryotic leader/signal peptidases, 7\u00b0 and is highly conserved in the cleavage sites of the LexA family (see [20] ). However, by no means all alanyl bonds are cleaved, and the specificity sites are apparently extended ones in which residues other than P1 are of great importance. No cleavage of simple substrates such as alanyl nitroanilides has been reported, and for leader peptidase it was found that a pentapeptide was the smallest substrate detectably cleaved. 7~ Mutations several residues away on either side of the cleavage site can greatly affect the rate of autolytic cleavage of LexA (see [20] ), again consistent with an extended substrate-binding site.\n\nThe protein known as LexA represses about 20 genes of the SOS regulon that are involved in DNA repair in E. coli. After treatments of the bacterium that damage DNA or inhibit DNA replication, LexA is inactivated, leading to derepression of the genes for DNA repair (see [20] ). LexA is known from other bacteria too, but more surprisingly, homologous repressors also occur in lambdoid phages 72 (Table VIII) . Cleavage of the phage repressors results in phage induction.\n\nIn E. coli, the derepression of the DNA repair system is effected by the RecA protein, which acquires \"coprotease\" activity in the presence of single-stranded DNA, causing it to undergo an interaction with LexA that results in inactivation of LexA by proteolytic cleavage. The bond cleaved by the peptidase activity of LexA is the AlaSq-Gly bond, which disrupts the DNA-binding part of the molecule, inactivating it. At one time, it was thought that the peptidase activity that causes the derepression was mediated by a catalytic site on the RecA protein, but it is now clear that this is an autolytic reaction, in which the catalytic activity is that of LexA (see [20] ). Isolated LexA autolyses slowly when incubated in vitro at alkaline pH, but the reaction triggered by RecA is much more rapid.\n\nThe molecules of LexA and related repressors consist of about 200 amino acid residues, of which the N-terminal 90 or so form the DNAbinding domain, for which crystallographic structures are available. 73 The C-terminal part of the molecules contains the residues that form the catalytic site for autolytic peptide bond cleavage. Of the amino acid residues 7o G. von Heijne, Nucleic Acids Res. 14, 4683 (1986). Bacterial Leader Peptidase I Family ($26) Eubacteria contain at least three leader peptidases. Murein prelipoprotein peptidase (leader peptidase 2), which removes the leader peptide from one of the components of the bacterial outer membrane, may be an aspartic endopeptidase.78 Type IV prepilin leader peptidase is a cysteine peptidase (see [32] ). The serine-type leader peptidase has the more general function of removing the leader peptides from the other secreted proteins and proteins that are targeted to the periplasm and periplasmic membrane. It is thus most closely analogous to the eukaryote signal peptidase, but differs in being monomeric. The catalytic residues of E. coli leader peptidase 1 have been identified as a Ser/Lys dyad (Fig. 7) (see [21] ).\n\nMitochondria possess three metallopeptidases that remove N-terminal targeting peptides, the mitochondrial processing peptidase (family M16) and the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase (M3), but the inner membrane leader peptidase is a serine enzyme. In fact, the enzyme is composed of two subunits, both homologous with the bacterial leader peptidase 1. The enzyme is responsible for removing leader peptides from both nuclearand mitochondrial-encoded proteins destined for the inner mitochondrial space, and it is believed that both subunits are active, with distinct specificities .79\n\nThe eukaryote microsomal signal peptidase complex, responsible for removing signal peptides from secretory proteins as they are transported into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, is much more complex than its eubacterial and mitochondrial counterparts (see [22] ). Varying numbers of subunits have so far been isolated; in yeast there are four, in chicken oviduct there are two, and in dog pancreas there are five. In each species, one of the subunits is glycosylated, but as far as is known, the glycosylated subunits are not directly involved in the peptidase activity. Of the other subunits so far sequenced, one from yeast, one from rat, and two from dog are homologous, and form family $27 (Table VIII) . These subunits (about 20 kDa) contain sequences reminiscent of those in which the catalytic residues of bacterial leader peptidase 1 are located (Fig. 7) . The alignment suggests that the eukaryote signal peptidases depend on a Ser/ His dyad for activity, in contrast to the Ser/Lys dyad of the eubacterial leader peptidases 1. The existence of two subunits in dog that may have catalytic activity is analogous to the situation in yeast mitochondrial inner membrane leader peptidase (family $26).\n\nEmbracing Families $14, $16, and $25\n\nAlthough the serine endopeptidase components of the Clp endopeptidase (family S 14), the multicatalytic endopeptidase complex (MEC; family $25), and endopeptidase La (S16) do not show similarities in sequence, all the peptidase domains are associated with ATP-binding domains that are homologous to each other, and in each case the interaction couples the hydrolysis ofpeptide bonds to that of ATP. In view of these similarities, it is natural to look closely for any indication that the proteins of these three families may have a single origin.\n\nClp and the subunits of MEC associate in approximately hexameric rings. These further associate with ATPase subunits, to produce complexes that appear to have similar topology in the electron microscope, s\u00b0 Immunological cross-reactivity between E. coli CIpP and subunits of MEC has been reported by two groups, s\u00b0,sl In addition, marked similarities in the chymotrypsin-like activities of Clp and MEC led Arribas and Castafio 8\u00b0 to suggest that ClpP might be evolutionarily related to subunits expressing chymotrypsin-like activity in MEC.\n\nIn endopeptidase La the endopeptidas\u00a2 and ATPase components are parts of the single polypeptide chain, but there are other groups of enzymes in which catalytic and regulatory domains are fused in some members, and comprise separate subunits in others. Goldberg s2 has given a detailed account of the similarities and differences between endopeptidases La and Clp. In reviewing these indications of possible relationship between the three types of ATP-dependent endopeptidase, Rechsteiner et al. 83 provide an imaginative three-dimensional model to depict the way in which the structures may have evolved. However, there are no similarities around the catalytic residues in these enzymes. Moreover, though the so j. Arribas and J. G. Castafio, J. Biol. Chem. 268, 21165 (1993 Table III for explanation. order of catalytic residues is Ser/His in CIpP, this cannot be the case in endopeptidase La.\n\nThe members of families S14, S16, and $25 are listed in Table IX . Clp endopeptidase is a bacterial, ATP-dependent endopeptidase (see [23] ). Historically, the name \"clp\" arose as an acronym for \"caseinolytic protease\"; the enzyme has also been termed endopeptidase Ti. 82\n\nThe Clp endopeptidase exists as a complex of two types of subunits (CIpP and CIpA), of composition ClpP12ClpA 6 . The ClpP subunit is a heatshock protein synthesized under the control of o -32 factor. 84 Alone, CIpP has peptidase activity that is restricted to peptides of five residues or less, so it could be described as an oligopeptidase, but full endopeptidase activity is expressed by the complex with CIpA (or CIpB or ClpX; see [23] ). The additional subunits are homologous to the ATP-binding domain of the monomeric endopeptidase La, and will be considered below. The active site serine (Ser-111) and histidine (His-136) residues of CIpP have been identified for the E. coli enzyme, but no third member of a possible catalytic triad.\n\nProteins with sequences homologous to CIpP have been detected in chloroplast inner envelope membrane and soluble fraction, 85 and are encoded by the chloroplast genome. 86 The chloroplast protein has not been characterized, but ATP-dependent proteolysis has been detected in these organelles. 87 The chloroplast ClpP-like sequences have the active site serine and histidine residues conserved, but as yet no chloroplast CIpA component has been sequenced. We report here that the gene sequence of phosphoproteins of photosystem II from the chloroplast of the evening primrose (Oenothera argillicola) 88 includes a fragment of a homolog of CIpP at the 3' end of the complementary strand.\n\nA surprising homolog of CIpP is the 5' untranslated region of potato leaf-roll luteovirus (EMBL : D00530). This virus is a single-stranded RNA virus most closely related to the picornaviruses. The genomic RNA sequence 89 may be truncated at the 5' end. The CIpP homolog retains a residue equivalent to the active site serine, but not the active site histidine, and so is almost certainly inactive. Presumably, the viral sequence was acquired by horizontal genetic transfer from the potato host.\n\nIt has been suggested 83 that CIpP is homologous to ubiquitin-peptidase 2 from yeast, a cysteine peptidase (see [32] ). In the comparison with the E. coli CIpP, 19.6% identity can be detected over a region of 189 amino acids, but there is no statistically significant relationship (RDF score = 4.90). Moreover, the similarity is seen only with the E. coli ClpP and not with the chloroplast homologs, and the active site Ser of ClpP is replaced by Asp in the ubiquitin peptidase.\n\nUnlike the Clp endopeptidase, endopeptidase La (product of the Ion gene ofE. coli) is a single-chain mosaic protein, containing an ATP-binding domain and a peptidase domain (see [25] ). The ATP-binding domain is homologous to the CIpA and ClpB subunits of the Clp endopeptidase, and a number of other ATP-binding proteins such as bacterial NIF-specific and XYLR regulatory proteins (NIFA_KLEPN, XYLR_PSEPU).\n\nTo date, only the catalytic serine residue (Ser-679) has been identified. 9\u00b0 The sequences contain no conserved His C-terminal to this.\n\nHomologs of endopeptidase La have been discovered in the mitochondria of eukaryotes (see [26] ). These are from yeast and human cells.\n\nThe multicatalytic endopeptidase complex (MEC), also called the proteasome, is a 700-kDa endopeptidase containing about 24-28 similarly sized, homologous subunits. The complex occurs in the cytoplasm and nuclei of eukaryotic cells generally, as well as those of the archaebacterium Thermoplasma acidophylum (see [24] ). In the electron microscope, MEC is seen as a cylinder, formed as a stack of four rings, each of about seven subunits.\n\nIn the archaebacterium, MEC is composed of subunits of only two kinds, o~ and/3. 91 In eukaryotes, there are far more different subunits, but all are variants of the o~ or/3 type of structure, and are divided into A and B groups on this basis.\n\nThree types of peptidase activity are simply recognized by use of synthetic substrates, and these can be described as trypsin-like (although cleavage is predominantly of Arg+ bonds), chymotrypsin-like (cleaving Leu+, Tyr2r, and Pheq-bonds), and glutamyl peptidase (cleaving Glu+ bonds). The Thermoplasma enzyme shows only the chymotrypsin-like activity,92 but the eukaryotic endopeptidase complex shows all three, and indeed at least five separate catalytic sites are distinguishable in careful work (see [24] ). Whether the endopeptidase activity against/3-casein is attributable to any of the sites active on synthetic substrates is not clear. 93 It has yet to be established which subunits, and which catalytic residues, are responsible for the various activities, but most of these are inhibited by 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, and are probably those of atypical serine peptidase catalytic sites.\n\nAn alignment of the available sequences made with the PILEUP pro-gram (with the standard defaults) shows very few residues completely conserved. The possibility must be borne in mind that the minimal catalytic unit comprises both an A and a B type of subunit, with each contributing some of the active site residues. Among the few residues that are completely conserved in the sequences (both A and B type) are Gly-80, Asp-84, and Gly-166 (numbered according to the Thermoplasma a subunit). The potential active site residues completely conserved in the A subunits are Ser-16, Tyr-26, Asp-84, and perhaps Arg-130 (although Arg has not yet been proved to be a catalytic residue in any peptidase). In the B subunit, Asp-84 is the only completely conserved potential catalytic residue. There is some evidence for proteolytic processing in the rat B subunits, several of which have N-terminal threonine residues, implying a Gly+Thr cleavage at a site near the N terminus that is conserved in the great majority of B subunits. 94 Despite some contrary reports, 95' 96 the 26S ATP-dependent, ubiquitin conjugate-degrading enzyme complex is now generally believed to contain components of MEC as its catalytic unit. Additional components then confer the ATP dependence and the specificity for ubiquitin conjugates. 83\n\nThe one additional subunit of the 26S complex (EMBL : L02426) that has been sequenced includes putative ATP-binding domains that show significant similarities to those in CIpA (RDF score 6.93) and endopeptidase La (RDF score 5.99). 97 The subunit also shows a relationship to human Tat-binding protein I (TBPI_HUMAN), yeast cell division control protein 48 (CD48_YEAST), and a yeast peroxisome biosynthesis protein (PASI_YEAST), among others.\n\nThe members of families S18, S19, S21, S17, and $23 are listed in Table X .\n\nThe E. coli outer membrane endopeptidase omptin (the product of the ompT gene), previously known as protease VII, cleaves between paired basic amino acid residues (see [27] ). Omptin is inhibited by serine peptidase inhibitors such as DFP, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and Tos-Phe-CH2CI, but to date the active site residues have not been identified. 98 There are two homologs of omptin from other bacterial species. The E protein from Salmonella typhimurium is functionally analogous in that it is also located in the outer membrane and is capable of cleaving substrates similar to those cleaved by omptin. However, whereas omptin has a typical signal peptide for transport to the outer membrane, the N terminus of the protein E precursor is longer, with little similarity. 99 A second homolog is known from the plague organism, Yersinia pestis, and is believed to have a role in the transmission of the disease. The enzyme expresses both coagulant and fibrinolytic activities, according to the temperature. 1\u00b0\u00b0 The coagulant activity causes the blood meal to clot in the gut of the flea, which responds to ejecting the gut contents back into the host bloodstream together with the plague organism. The coagulant activity does not seem to be mediated by prothrombin activation, so the enzyme may act directly on fibrinogen. Fibrinolytic activity, in contrast, is brought about by activation of host plasminogen, producing the SERINE PEPTIDASES [2l same N terminus as host plasminogen activator, cleaving an Arg+Val bond. The Yersinia enzyme also seems to be capable of preventing an inflammatory reaction by destroying complement component C3, a component important in the production of the chemoattractant C5a fragment. ~0~\n\nCoccidioides imitis is a soil fungus, and the causative agent ofcoccidioidomycosis. Infection results from the inhalation of air-borne spores. The endopeptidase, described as chymotrypsin-like, is associated with the cell wall during active growth of the pathogenic cells. I\u00b02 The peptidase has been shown to be collagenolytic, elastinolytic, and able to cleave human IgG and IgA. Activity is inhibited by Tos-Phe-CH2C1, chymostatin, and oq-proteinase inhibitor. 1\u00b03 The sequence shows no relation to any other protein, and the active site residues have not been determined.\n\nCytomegaloviruses, which include the herpes simplex and Epstein-Barr viruses, are double-stranded DNA viruses. The virus particles are assembled in a process similar to that of bacteriophages, in which the proteins of the head are built on a scaffold called the assembly protein.\n\nThe prohead so formed becomes the head of the mature virus once the assembly protein has been degraded and the empty space filled with DNA.\n\nDegradation of the assembly protein is an autolytic event. The assembly protein has the proteinase, assemblin, as its C-terminal domain. Assemblin is inhibited by serine peptidase inhibitors such as DFP and PMSF, and cleaves Ala+Ser or Ala+Val bonds to release a polypeptide from the C terminus of the assembly protein. Assemblin may also release itself from its precursor, which would entail cleavage at an Ala+Ser bond, and exceptionally an Ala+Asn bond in infectious laryngotracheitis virus.\n\nIn the assemblin of simian cytomegalovirus, catalytic residues have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis as His-47 and Ser-118.~\u00b04\n\nBacteroides nodosus is the causal agent of ovine footrot, in which the hoof separates from the underlying epidermis. The presence of an endopeptidase with chymotrypsin-like specificity able to digest elastin, keratin, fibrinogen, and collagen implies that the disease is a proteolytic process. The enzyme has been identified as a divalent cation-dependent serine endopeptidase, but the sequence reported by Moses et al.~\u00b05 shows no resemblance to any other protein. A subtilisin homolog from this bacterium has been sequenced, ~\u00b06 raising the possibility that the protein identified by immunological screening of an expression library by Moses et al. may not be the peptidase after all.\n\nThis is a one-member family containing a periplasmic enzyme from E. coli that cleaves Tyr+ and Phe+ bonds in ester substrates such as Z-Tyrp-nitrophenyl ester. The enzyme had no amidase activity, and low activity on polypeptides. 1\u00b07 Activity was inhibited by DFP, but no active site residues are known.\n\nThe published sequence ~\u00b08 is identical to that of acyl-CoA thioesterase I, in which the active site serine was identified as Ser-10) \u00b09 His-157 occurs within a Gly-Ile-His motif that is conserved in other serine thioesterases and may be part of the active site. The enzyme is synthesized with a 26-residue leader peptide and is predicted to be a periplasmic enzyme (although previously thought to be cytoplasmic). There have been doubts for some time that protease I is a peptidase. N\u00b0"}
