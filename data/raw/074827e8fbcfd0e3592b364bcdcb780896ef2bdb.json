{"title": "Radioactive and enzymatic cloned c D N A probes for bovine enteric coronavirus detection by molecular hybridization", "body": "The bovine enteric coronavirus (BECV), a member of the family Coronaviridae, is a pleiomorphic enveloped spherical particle (120 nm in diameter) surrounded by a characteristic fringe of \"club-shaped\" peplomers. The viral genome is a single-stranded polyadenylated RNA of approximately 20 kb in length, coding for a Y-coterminal \"nested set\" of mRNAs and 4 major structural proteins: a phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein N (50 k), a transmembrane matrix glycoprotein M (20 k), a peplomeric glycoprotein S (present on the virion as 105 k J. Collomb etal. and 95 k subunits) and a haemagglutinin HE (125 k). Recently genes encoding for these proteins have been cloned and sequenced [1, 6, 10, 24] .\n\nBECV is implicated as one of the aetiological agents of neonatal calf diarrhoea [3, 15] . It is found alone or in association with rotaviruses, enterotoxigenic Escherichia eoti and Cryptosporidia [9] . During the acute stage of infection, virus particles are excreted in large amounts. They grow in the brush border of intestinal epithelial cells causing villous atrophy, diarrhoea, dehydratation and often death. Recent reports also suggest they possess a tropism for respiratory epithelial cells [19, 21] .\n\nA major problem regarding coronavirus infections is the tack of suitable diagnostic techniques for a specific and rapid identification of the virus in biological samples. Among the methods used for routine diagnosis, electron microscopy (EM) of faecal samples [4] is time-consuming. It has also often proved difficult to differenciate pleiomorphic coronavirus particles from the fringed bodies normally found in faeces. Immunofluorescent staining of intestinal sections can only be used for post mortem diagnosis [14] . Alternative methods using the haemagglutinating activity of BECV, such as haemadsorption-elution-haemagglutination assay (HEHA) or haemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI), lack specificity and sensitivity [22, 23, 27] . Enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assays (ELISA) have been developed for the detection of BECV in faeces. The first of them employed polyclonal sera with low specificity [20] . Better results were obtained with a mixture of monoclonal antibodies coated on microplates for antigen capture [5, 7] , but very little information on this has been made available yet. Recently, radioactive cDNA probes have been reported to be sensitive and specific for the detection of the Mebus strain of BECV by molecular hybridization [25, 29, 30] . This paper describes investigations for the development of a highly specific and sensitive slot blot hybridization assay to detect the F15 strain of BECV by means of radioactive and enzymatic cDNA probes. The enzymatic probe, labelled through covalent linkage to peroxidase using the \"enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) gene detection system\", was chosen because of its longterm stability and also of its sensitivity reputed to be practically as great as that of a radioactive probe. The ultimate aim was to use the enzymatic probe for routine epidemiological investigation. An attempt has been made to determine the optimal conditions for virus detection in biological samples.\n\nThe F15 strain of BECV, propagated in the human rectal tumor (HRT-18) cell line [17] , and the Purdue-115 strain of TGEV, propagated in swine testicule (ST) cell line [2] , were obtained from Dr. J. Laporte (INRA, Jouy en Josas, France). The simian-SA11 strain of rotavirus was grown in MA-104 cells.\n\nThe methods used for infection of HRT-18 cells, titration, and BECV purification by differential and isopycnic ultracentrifugation on sucrose gradients, were identical to those previously described [16, 17, 28] . The virion RNA was extracted using the proteinase Ksodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-phenol method. An equal volume of a solution containing 2 \u00d7 TNE buffer (20 mM Tris-HC1, 200 mM NaC1 and 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and 400 l-tg/ ml proteinase K was added to the purified virus suspension. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C and an equal volume of the same buffer containing 2% SDS was added. The incubation was continued for 5 rain at 50 \u00b0C then for 30 rain at 25 \u00b0C. The suspension was extracted with phenol/chloroform, followed by RNA precipitation at -20 \u00b0C with cold absolute ethanol. The dried pellet was dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water and handled in autoclaved siliconised containers. The amount of viral RNA was quantitated spectrophotometrically, assuming that an OD of 1 at 260 nm corresponds to 40 ~tg/ml of single-stranded RNA.\n\nThe construction of the cDNA library of BECV genomic RNA, the characterization and sequence analysis of the clones obtained, have been described previously [l [, 24] . Briefly, the virus genome was used as a template for first-strand cDNA synthesis using as a primer either oligo dT or the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the Barn HI cleavage site (GGATCC). RNase T2-treated cDNA-RNA heteroduplexes were cloned into the Pst I site of the pBR322 plasmid by homopolymeric tailing and used to transform competent RRI Escherichia coil The tetracycline-resistant, ampicillin-susceptible colonies were then selected. Recombinant plasmids were isolated from cultured bacteria by alkaline lysis 1-13]. DNA insert was excised from the purified plasmid using restriction endonuclease Pst I, then purified by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and electroelution. Viral DNA inserts 174 (2kb), 160 (2.1 kb), PG78 (2.3kb), were selected to prepare probes for this study (Fig. 1) . Inserts PG78 and 160 yielded two fragments of respectively 1.4kb-0.9kb and 1.8 kb~.3 kb because of an internal Pst I cutting site. This is why most experiments were made using insert 174. \n\nPurified inserts were labelled by random priming according to Feinberg and Vogelstein [8] using [ct-32p]dCTP and a commercial \"Multiprime DNA labelling systems\" (Amersham). The specific activities ranged from 2 to 5 x 108 dpm/gg. Enzymatic probes were obtained by covalent linkage of horseradish peroxidase to singlestranded DNA by means of glutaraldehyde, using the labelling procedure developed by Renz and Kurz [18] and the \"ECL gene detection system\" (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nBEVC genomic R N A Varying amounts of purified genomic RNA made in siliconised containers, were denatured at 950C for 5rain in 20gl of TE buffer (10raM pH7.4 Tris-HC1, 1 mM EDTA), mixed with 100txl of 20 x SSC (1 x SSC is 150raM NaC1, 15mM sodium citrate, pH7.0) and applied directly to nitrocellulose filters.\n\nCell cultures were inoculated with the appropriate virus at a multiplicity of approximately 1 PFU per cell. Cell culture fluids were harvested at 72h post infection and clarified by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10 rain. Supernatant dilutions were made in 25 ~tl of TE buffer, then three different methods were applied: (/) each sample was denatured at 95 \u00b0C for 5 rain, mixed with 100 gl of 1 x SSC and applied directly to nitrocellulose filters. (ii) Viruses were lysed by the addition of an equal volume of t % Nonidet P-40 (NP-40) in TE buffer as described by Shocktey etal. [25] . Samples were incubated for 10rain at 0\u00b0C and mixed with an equal volume of a freshly prepared solution of two parts of 37% (wt/wt) formaldehyde and three parts of 20 x SSC, denatured at 60 \u00b0C for 15 min and applied to nitrocellulose filters. (iil) Nucleic acids were extracted using the proteinase K-SDS-phenol method as described above for extraction of genomic RNA. After extraction and precipitation with ethanol, nucleic acids were dissolved in 20 gl of TE buffer, denatured at 95 *C for 5 rain, mixed with 100 gl of 20 x SSC and applied to nitrocellulose filters.\n\nFrom diarrhoeal neonatal calves were kindly provided by the Regional Veterinary Laboratory (Nancy, France). Eleven of samples were examinated for coronavirus haemagglutination inhibition [22J and eight by using both ELISA (commercial TETRA-KIT Diagnostic Laboratory LTP) and the standard electron microscopy.\n\nTo prepare samples for slot blot hybridization, 750 gl of PBS were added to 500 ~tl of faecal material, then vortexed and clarified by Microfuge centrifugation for 1 min. Supernatants were treated as described above for cell culture-grown virus using the proteinase K-SDS-phenol method.\n\nSamples prepared as described above were spotted by means of a 24-well slot blot vacuum manifold (slot blot PR 600-Hoefer scientific instruments) onto nitrocellulose filters (BA 85; Schleicher and Schuell) equilibrated in 20 x SSC and then baked at 80\u00b0C for 2h.\n\nWhen a radioactive probe was used, the nitrocellulose filters were prehybridized for 2 hours at 42 \u00b0C in plastic bags containing a solution (4mt/100cm 2) of 50% formamide-5 x Denhardt's solution (1 x is 0.02% Ficolt, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumine)-0.1% SDS-5 \u00d7 SSC and 200 ~tg/ml ofsonicated calf thymus DNA. Hybridization was then performed under the same conditions with fresh hybridization buffer containing denatured cDNA probe (0.5 to 1 \u00d7 10 6 cpm/cm 2) for 16 h at 42 \u00b0C. The nitrocellulose filters were washed twice in 2 x SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature then twice in 0.1 x SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15min at 52\u00b0C. The air dried blots were autoradiographed on X-ray films (X Omat AR-5 Kodak) at -80 *C for 24-48 h using intensifying screens.\n\nWith an enzymatic probe, the hybridization assay was performed using the \"ECL gene detection system\" (Amersham) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prehybridization was done for 10min at 42\u00b0C in sealed plastic bags containing a commercial hybridization buffer (0.25 ml/cm 2) which included 6 M urea and 0.5 M NaC1. The enzymatic probe was then added at a concentration of 20 ng/ml without a change of buffer and the hybridization was continued overnight at 42 \u00b0C. After washing the filters twice in 6 M urea, 0.5 \u00d7 SSC, 4g/1 SDS for 20min at 42\u00b0C then twice in 2 \u00d7 SSC for 5min at room temperature, the detection signal was elicited by performing an enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) reaction by means of peroxidase-catalyzed oxydation of luminol where the probe was bound. The filters were immersed for 1 rain in a detection reagent (0.125 ml/cm 2) and then exposed to hyperfilm-ECL (Amersham) for between 1 and 5 min.\n\nTo evaluate the sensitivity of the slot blot hybridization assay, varying amounts of genomic R N A extracted from purified BECV and ranging from 100 ng to 0.1 pg were first denatured, then applied to nitrocellulose filters in high salt concentration and finally hybridized. Two probe labelling techniques were compared: radiolabelling with 32p and enzymatic labelling through covalent linkage to peroxidase and detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (\"ECL gene detection system\"). Insert 174 was used alone as probe or in association with inserts 160 and PG 78 in order to amplify the detection signal by hybridization on different locations of the viral genome. Inserts 174 and 160, selected in the cDNA library, correspond to a large portion of the matrix (M) and nucleocapsid (N) protein genes and include overlapping sequences covering about half their length. Insert PG 78 is the 5' terminus of the peplomeric glycoprotein (S) gene and does not include any overlapping sequence with inserts 174 and 160 (Fig. t) .\n\nThe results, shown in Fig. 2 , indicate that a positive hybridization signal can be obtained with either radioactive (Fig. 21) or enzymatic (Fig. 2 II) probes although intensity of detection is superior with radioactive probe.\n\nThe radioactive probe 174 (Fig. 21 , column A) detects viral R N A at a concentration of 3 pg after 24h autoradiography and can even reach 1.5 pg when exposure time is longer (48 to 72 h or more). This is the equivalent of 1 to 2 \u00d7 105 viral genomes, assuming that the BECV genomic size; is 6.9 \u00d7 106 [12] . Preliminary assays conducted by applying genomic R N A samples to nitrocellulose filters by manual dot blot had previously indicated that the radioactive probe detects viral RNA at a concentration of 11 ng (data not shown). It appears therefore that if a slot blotting apparatus is employed, whereby samples can be concentrated on a small slot membrane area, the sensitivity increases significantly and the detection limit is lowered about 5 x 103 times. With the enzymatic probe 174 (Fig. 2 II, column A), less sensitive than the radioactive one, detection is limited at 100 pg of genomic RNA, i.e., 109 genomes. The result is obtained on hyperfilm-ECL after a very short exposure time (1 to 2 min). If exposure time is increased to 5 to 10 min (or more), the sensitivity of the hybridization assay is not improved and some background noise appears which may confuse results (data not shown).\n\nThe amount of detectable viral R N A is not greater when a combination of three probes (174-160-PG78) is added; whether radioactive or enzymatic labelling is used (Fig. 2, columns B) . The intensity of detection is slightly enhanced when an enzymatic probe-pool is used, particularly for blots having the lowest genomic RNA concentration. But signals are not significantly enhanced with a radioactive probe-pool.\n\nBECV-infected HRT-18 cells were used to develop a detection procedure for the presence of BECV in faecal samples. For this purpose the influence of sample treatment on the detection of BECV-RNA by slot blot hybridization was studied: various dilutions of clarified supernatant of BECV-infected HRT-18 cells with a titre of 2.1 x 108 PFU/ml were treated in three different ways. Some were denatured then directly spotted to the nitrocellulose filters. Others were spotted after virus lysis through NP-40 treatment. Some again were spotted after nucleic acid extraction using the proteinase K-SDS-phenol method as described in Materials and methods. Hybridization assays were then performed with either radioactive or enzymatic probe 174. At the same time, the specificity of the cDNA probe was analysed. In order to detect potential homologies with the probe, slot blot hybridization was performed in the same conditions as above, with noninfected HRT-18 cells and two other types of virus propagated in cell culture and associated with gastroenteritis disease: rotavirus and another member of the family Coronaviridae, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV).\n\nThe results are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. BECV can be detected directly without preliminary treatment of the samples in the supernatant of infected HRT-18 cells. In this case the samples were spotted to nitrocellulose filters in low salt concentration according to the observations published by Verbeek and Tijssen [30] . These authors have demonstrated that the hydrophobic attachment of the viral envelope was optimal in low salt conditions whereas nucleic acids are usually spotted in 20 \u00d7 SSC. In such conditions, with a radioactive probe 174, a hybridization signal is obtained up to a 10 -2 dilution, equivalent to 2.1 x 104pFU (Fig. 3 I, column A) .\n\nWith NP-40 treated samples, only a poor BECV detection is obtained (Fig. 3 II, column A) which is different from what was found by Shockley et al. [25] . Such discrepancy may by due to filtration problems in spotting particularly viscous samples to nitrocellulose.\n\nOn the contrary, the proteinase K-SDS-phenol method increases detection sensitivity tenfold relatively to direct sample spotting. A hybridization signal is obtained up to a 10-3 dilution, equivalent to 2.1 x 103 PFU (Fig. 3 III, column  A) . Such a signal indicates that there are at least 3 pg of viral RNA on the blot equivalent to 2.6 x 105 viral particles. The titre of the viral suspension, calculated from these data, is therefore 2.6 x 10 l\u00b0 PFU/ml. But the titre obtained by plaque assay titration is 2.1 \u00d7 108 PFU/ml, which is the same as the titre usually obtained for BECV growth on HRT-18 cells. This interesting result shows that, in a three-day-old viral suspension, there would be 100 non-infectious particles to one titration-detected particle. This observation agrees with Shockley et al. [25] and Laporte (data not shown).\n\nIdentical results are given by slot blot hybridization with tile enzymatic probe 174, with a slight difference, though: the sensitivity is 10 times lower than that of the radioactive probe, whatever the mode of sample treatment (Fig. 4,  columns A) .\n\nThe radioactive probe 174 binds specifically to BECV-RNA. No hybridization is observed with either non-infected HRT-18 cells or rotaviruses or even Autoradiography was done at -80 \u00b0C for 24 h with intensifying screen T G E \u00a5 , whatever the treatment or the dilution (Fig. 3, columns B, C, D) . If these three types of samples are hybridized with the enzymatic probe 174 when they are directly spotted or after NP-40 treatment to nitrocellulose filters, then false positives appear (Fig. 4 1 and II) . This is probably due to the great affinity of peroxidase for macromolecules contained in samples. Such an artifact, which may confuse results, is indeed avoided by nucleic acid extraction using the proteinase K-SDS-phenol method (Fig. 4 III) .\n\nTo evaluate the usefulness of gene-based detection of coronavirus infections with other diagnostic methods, faecal samples from diarrhoeal neonatal calves Table 1 and compared with those obtained by conventional methods: haemagglutination inhibition (HAI), ELISA and electron microscopy (EM). On examination, the following points seem worth mentioning. (/) The sensitivity of the hybridization test using enzymatic probe and chemiluminescence detection is sufficient to allow BECV diagnosis in diarrhoeal neonatal calves. (ii) The proteinase K-SDS-phenol method is well adapted to the treatment of faecal samples, the interpretation of results is not hindered by any background signal. (iiO Comparison between the slot blot hybridization test and other diagnostic methods reveals that the best correlation is found a Faecal material was treated with proteinase K-SDS-phenol method as described in Materials and methods. Hybridization was performed at 42\u00b0C for 16h with enzymatic probe 174. Time exposure on Hyperfilm-ECL was 2rain. Estimated viral RNA concentrations: -no hybridization signal; < 100 pg homologous RNA per slot; + 100 pg to 10 ng; + + 1 0 n g t o 100ng; + + + >100ng b Faecal material was examinated by electron microscopy (EM), haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and ELISA: + coronaviruses detected; -no coronaviruses detected; ND not done with the H A I , the two tests disagreed in only one case. The lower correlation observed with E M m a y be due to difficulty to differentiate true coronaviruses f r o m the coronavirus-like particles frequently observed in faeces. Alternatively, as molecular hybridization was performed several days after E M , it is conceivable that the viral R N A should have been degraded by nuclease in faecal specimens and therefore left undetected by the probe. Finally, molecular hybridization proves better t h a n E L I S A in yielding more positive results.\n\nThe research presented in this paper shows that it is possible to detect BECV by means of molecular hybridization using c D N A probes prepared f r o m viral genomic R N A . The points which were considered were the sensitivity and specificity of the hybridization test, and the conditions of its potential application for BECV detection in biological samples.\n\nThe cDNA probe 174 labelled with 32 p allows for the detection of quantities of homologous RNA as small as 1 to 3 pg, equivalent to 2 x 105 genomes. The ECL gene detection system, including DNA labelling with peroxidase combined with enhanced chemiluminescence, provides a level of sensitivity which is 50 times lower than radioactive labelling. However, the enzymatic procedure has the advantage of being easy and quick to use. The labelling takes 10 min and the results are obtained on hyperfilm-ECL in 2 min, whereas autoradiography takes between 24 and 48 h.\n\nNo significant signal amplification is obtained when a combination of three radioactive or enzymatic probes (174, 160, PG 78) is used. A possible explanation is the presence of overlapping sequences in inserts 174 and 160, which may foster the reassociation of DNA fragments in solution at the expense of hybridization to the nitrocellulose filter. Such reassociation probably occurs more easily with the radioactive probe, as labelling does not change the DNA configuration, than it does with the DNA probe covalently linked to peroxidase. This may account for the very small signal amplification obtained with the enzymatic probe.\n\nThe specificity of slot blot hybridization for the detection of BECV in biological samples has been clearly shown. No detectable binding was observed with the heterologous nucleic acid of rotavirus and non-infected HRT-18 cells. It is expected that the probe 174 which specifically identifies the F 15 strain of BECV will also identify the Mebus strain, as in both BECV strains the nucleotide sequences of genes encoding for M and N proteins display almost 100% homology with only minor changes [6, 24] . The probe 174 does not allow the identification of all the members of the family Coronaviridae, as no detectable binding is observed with TGEV. This can easily be explained by the small percentage of homology (under 50%) existing between these two viruses [1 t, 25] . For the same reasons, similar results could probably be obtained for RNA detection of avian coronavirus IBV with which homology is also small [26] . This observation is to be linked to the fact that these coronaviruses belong to three separate antigenic subgroups and it opens the way for a possible use of the hybridization test to identify coronavirus subgroups.\n\nBECV can be detected in supernatant of infected HRT-18 cells directly spotted onto the nitrocellulose filter. The procedure is simple and rapid to perform. With it, it is no longer necessary to prepare RNase-free glassware and buffers, whereas this is compulsory for the particularly delicate extraction of viral RNA. It is true, however, that the extraction of nucleic acids by using the proteinase K-SDS-phenol method greatly increases sensitivity. Some of these nucleic acids get lost in the process, but viral RNA binding is improved when proteins and macromolecules competing with viral RNA on the binding sites of nitrocellulose are eliminated. Moreover this process does not produce any false positives when the enzymatic probe is employed. Although it is more time-consuming, the proteinase K-SDS-phenol method has proved preferable to direct spotting for BECV detection in faecal samples. The latter are loaded with various debris which may stop the wells of the slot blotting apparatus and prevent viral RNA binding.\n\nIn summary, the slot blot hybridization assay analysed in this study is sensitive and specific with both radioactive and enzymatic probes. The test is relatively rapid and can be conducted in less than 48 h, particularly if enzymatic probe is employed. Many samples can be examined in a short time. This method therefore will be useful as an epidemiological tool. Preliminary experiments on faecal specimens from diarrhoeal neonatal calves have proved that the molecular hybridization test with enzymatic probe is valid for general BECV diagnostic use. The sensitivity of the test appears to be at least as high as with the ELISA, HAI and EM diagnostic methods."}
