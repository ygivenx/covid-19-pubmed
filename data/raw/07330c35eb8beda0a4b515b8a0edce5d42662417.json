Protocols and primers used for screening bird samples cDNA for influenza screening was synthesized using a Superscript II kit (Invitrogen) in a 20-\u00b5l reaction mixture following the manufacturer's protocol with 11.5-\u00b5l of RNA and a 10\u00b5M concentration of a Uni-12 specific primer (5'-AGCAAAAGCAGG-3'). A 5x RT Buffer, 0.1M dithiothreitol (DTT), 10mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix (dNTP), and 200U of SuperScript II RT. Samples were tested for influenza A using a Taqman qPCR assay designed to amplify a conserved region of the matrix gene. A 25-\u00b5l reaction was used containing 2x RT Buffer (Biorad), 10\u00b5M forward and reverse primer, 20\u00b5M probe, and 4-\u00b5l of cDNA Complementary DNA was also synthesized from RNA with random hexamers using a Superscript II kit (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's protocols. This cDNA was screened for astroviruses, coronaviruses, flaviviruses, and paramyxoviruses in an Applied Biosystems Veriti 96 well thermocycler. Astrovirus detection followed a heminested protocol where a 25-\u00b5l initial reaction was used containing 1x buffer Taq (Thermo   Scientific) . After an initial denaturation period at 94\u00b0C for 3 minutes, 30 cycles of amplification were carried out with a denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds, annealing at 50\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and extension at 68\u00b0C for 30 seconds. This was followed by a final extension at 68\u00b0C for 5 minutes before being held at 10\u00b0C until removal from the thermocycler. The heminested step used 1-\u00b5l of the first round PCR product as template and follows the same protocol as the first PCR (2).\n\nCoronaviruses were tested with a PCR final volume of 25-\u00b5l containing a 1x buffer (Thermo Scientific), 0.2mM dNTP mix, 0.5 \u00b5M F and R primer (Corfor: 5'-GGTTGGGACTATCCTAAGTGTGA -3', Correv: 5' -CCATCATCAGATAGAATCATCAT-3'), 1mM MgCl 2 , and 1.25 units of Taq (Thermo Scientific). cDNA synthesized from RNA with random hexamers was used as a template. After an initial denaturation period at 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes, 40 cycles of amplification were carried out with a denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, annealing at 48\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and extension at 68\u00b0C for 1 minute. This was followed by a final extension at 68\u00b0C for 5 minutes before being held at 10\u00b0C until removal from the thermocycler (3).\n\nParamyxoviruses were tested using a heminested PCR protocol where a 25-\u00b5l initial reaction was used containing 1x buffer (Thermo Scientific), 0.2mM dNTP mix, 0.5 \u00b5M F1, F2, and R primer (ParaF1: 5'-GAAGGITATTGTCAIAARNTNTGGAC-3', ParaF2: 5'-GTTGCTTCAATGGTTCARGGNGAYAA-3', ParaR: 5'-GCTGAAGTTACIGGITCICCDATRTTNC -3'), 1mM MgCl 2 , and 1.25 units of Taq (Thermo Scientific). cDNA synthesized from random hexamers were used as a template. After an initial denaturation period at 94\u00b0C for 2 minutes, 35 cycles of amplification were carried out with a denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 15 seconds, annealing at 49\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 minute. This was followed by a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes before being held at 10\u00b0C until removal from the thermocycler. The heminested step used 1-\u00b5l of the first round PCR product and follows the same protocol as the first PCR (4).\n\nFlaviviruses were screened for using a PCR with a final volume of 25-\u00b5l containing a 1x buffer (Thermo Scientific), 0.2mM dNTP mix, 0.5 \u00b5M F and R primer (VIR2217F: 5'-TGTGTCTACAACATGATGGGAAAGAGAGA-3', VIR2217F: 5'-TGCTCCCAGCCACATGTACCA-3'), 1mM MgCl 2 , and 1.25 units of Taq (Thermo Scientific). cDNA synthesized from random hexamers were used as a template. After an initial denaturation period at 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes, there were 8 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 48\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds, followed by 37 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 56\u00b0C for 20 seconds, and 72\u00b0C for 20 seconds culminating with a 2 minute extension at 72\u00b0C and held at 10\u00b0C until processing (5) ."}
