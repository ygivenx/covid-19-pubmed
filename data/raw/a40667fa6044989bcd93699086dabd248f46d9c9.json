{"title": "Functional Requirements for Biosurveillance", "body": "Chapters 2 and 3 described biosurveillance as the world has practiced it for the latter half of the 20th century. During that time, the basic methods for detecting cases, detecting outbreaks, and characterizing outbreaks changed little. The methods used to detect and characterize the 1975 Lyme disease outbreak and the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic differed primarily in microbiological techniques (e.g., the increasing use of genetic analysis) and the speed at which outbreaks were investigated.\n\nAround the beginning of the 21st century, however, researchers began to investigate new types of surveillance data and to automate methods for the collection and analysis of these data. A new requirement motivated these researchers--that of very early detection of disease outbreaks (Wagner et al., 2001a) . The new methods were met with skepticism (Broome et al., 2002; Buehler et al., 2003; Reingold, 2003; Stoto et al., 2004) . Their rate of adoption was slow until the fall of 2001, when the anthrax mail attacks in the United States effectively ushered in a new era of biosurveillance (Wagner, 2002) .\n\nWe discuss these newer methods in detail in Parts III through V of this book. In this chapter, we discuss the redesign of biosurveillance systems from the perspective of an engineer or a system analyst. To satisfy the new requirement for very early detection, a designer must pay more attention to the systematic aspect of biosurveillance. The designer must examine how quickly outbreaks must be detected and characterized and design a system that can meet these requirements by collecting data that are available earlier than are case reports, collecting those data in real time from existing computer systems in hospitals and other organizations, and analyzing the data in real time.\n\nAn engineer or a system analyst approaches design problems in a manner that is fundamentally different from how a doctor or an epidemiologist approaches diagnostic problems. Engineers and systems analysts first develop functional requirements, which for biosurveillance are specifications of the diseases that must be detected, the smallest size outbreak that must be detected, and the time frame within which detection must occur. From the functional requirements, the designer then develops system specifications and finally builds a system.\n\nWhen designing and building a commercial information system, the elucidation of functional requirements is a first step in the process, and it is a prerequisite for subsequent steps. If the information system is an early warning system for missile attack, for example, the functional requirements might prominently feature the detection of the attack within several minutes of launch. In the case of a biosurveillance system for an aerosol release of anthrax, the functional requirements might similarly emphasize detection as quickly as possible, but no later than within days of release. Although a biosurveillance system is fundamentally an information system, the process of functional-requirement specification is often less rigorous than in the commercial world. Even when organizations develop functional requirements (e.g., for an electronic disease reporting system), the requirements do not specify how quickly an outbreak of disease must be detected, rather they are formulated in terms of the data that should be collected, the properties of the user interface, and system security. The functional requirements of the Public Health Information Network (PHIN) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are an example of current functional requirement specifications (www.cdc.gov/phin). To our knowledge, no organization has published functional requirements derived from explicit consideration of timeliness requirements for specific diseases. System designers have been let off the hook, so to speak, by their customers for this--arguably, the most difficult-requirement. The two published analyses that considered timeliness requirements were partial analyses: one analyzed gaps in current biosurveillance systems (Dato et al., 2001) , and the second analyzed the data requirements for earlier detection (Wagner et al., 2001b) .\n\nTo illustrate the approach that an engineer or systems analyst (henceforth referred to as designers) would take when designing a biosurveillance system, let us consider a special purpose system for detection of outbreaks caused by the organism Bacillus anthracis, a bacterium that can form a spore that can survive for extended periods in nature. The spores can infect humans or animals through the skin, through ingestion, and through inhalation. B. anthracis causes the disease anthrax, which was once a common disease among wool handlers but now is of concern as a terrorist threat .\n\nA designer tasked with the design of an anthrax biosurveillance system has available two outbreaks of anthrax from which to derive timeliness (and other) functional requirements.\n\nHe has available the 1979 Sverdlovsk release of B. anthracis (Kirov strain) from Soviet Biological Weapons Compound 19, described in Chapter 2, and the 2001 U.S. postal attacks ( Jernigan et al., 2001; Greene et al., 2002) . The Sverdlovsk outbreak was a result of accidental release of anthrax spores into the air. Unknown individuals used envelopes containing anthrax spores to carry out the U.S. postal attacks. Kaufmann et al. (1997) analyzed the available information from the Sverdlovsk outbreak and information about the disease anthrax. They demonstrated that the requirement for timeliness of detection of an aerosol release of anthrax is ideally the moment of release, but no later than 5 days after release. Wagner et al. (2003b) used a taxonomy of surveillance data depicted in Table 4 .1 to identify the types of surveillance data that might be available in this time window. They concluded that the system specifications for a biosurveillance system capable of meeting the time requirement would include components to obtain and process data from biosensors, preclinical data sources (e.g., sales of cough syrup), and early clinical data (e.g., symptoms and radiological reports). A system would have to collect and analyze these data in near real time with attention to corroborating and discriminating data from other sources, such as wind patterns and physical location of individuals in the days preceding onset of illness. They concluded that conventionally trained physicians could not be relied on to detect an outbreak of this type. In the Sverdlovsk outbreak, the earliest suspicion of anthrax came from an autopsy finding of a cardinal's cap (hemorrhagic meningitis, a pathognomonic finding for the disease anthrax) on the eighth day after the release (Abramova et al., 1993) , by which time 14 individuals had died (Guillemin, 2001) . At least six victims had their early symptoms dismissed by physicians as not serious, and 21 individuals had died by the time that the laboratory confirmation of anthrax was broadcast to area hospitals on the 10th day after the accidental release (Guillemin, 2001) . TAB L E 4.1 Taxonomy of Surveillance Data 9 Preoutbreak data: This category refers to data obtained during the period before the onset of the outbreak. Examples of data that might contribute to detection include intelligence that heightens suspicion or host factors such as vaccinations that determine susceptibility. 9 Attack, release, or exposure data refers to data obtained at or very near the time of an accidental of intentional contamination. Data from this time might come from biosensor arrays, unauthorized airplane flights, or other activities.\n\nPresymptomatic data (incubation period data) refers to data obtained between the time that a person or animal becomes infected until the recognition of first symptoms. Examples of presymptomatic data are serology or cultures from presymptomatic individuals that are obtained serendipitously, through routine screening, or through enhanced screening because environmental conditions are favorable for an outbreak (e.g., there has been a natural disaster such as a flood).\n\nPrediagnostic data refers to data from the period between the onset of symptoms in an individual and when the illness becomes more fully developed and distinguishable from other illnesses. Examples of prediagnostic data include diarrheal symptoms or upper respiratory symptoms. Examples of data sources of potential value for the detection of individuals experiencing early symptoms include sales of over-the-counter cold medicines, vital signs, physical findings, and absenteeism.\n\nSpecific syndrome data are data that either singly or in combination strongly suggest a specific agent. Examples include selected symptoms, histories of exposures, vital signs, physical findings, laboratory results, radiology results, and preliminary results from microbiology laboratories (e.g., Gram stains). 9 Diagnostic data are data that are sufficient on their own to conclude that a patient has a disease. Examples include microbiology cultures or autopsy reports. Diagnostic data usually can be obtained during the specific syndrome period but can also be found during other periods through screening, routine testing, or testing of the environment. Three additional categories of data in the table do not fit neatly on a timeline. They are: 9 Epidemiologic data, which refers to the whereabouts of individuals before onset of disease, food and water consumption, contacts with affected individuals, and location information (work, home addresses; feedlot number). These data are often only available for analysis after the onset of the outbreak because they are not routinely collected, but some characteristics may be routinely recorded electronically in various databases. 9 Zoonotic data, which refer to data from veterinary and public health sources. Examples include small animal deaths, positive mosquito pools for malaria, animal vaccination status, and sentinel chicken serology. 9 Environmental data refer to data about the environment. Examples include weather, refrigeration temperature, ventilation plans, and water supply areas.\n\nFrom Dato et al. (2001) .\n\nAfter the fall 2001 attack, the U.S. Postal Service developed the biohazard detection system (BDS), an air monitoring system based on a DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for B. anthracis (U.S. Postal Service, 2004; Military Postal Service Agency, 2004) . BDS attaches to mail-sorting machines. There is little doubt that the U.S. Postal Service designed this system with the functional requirement of early detection of an anthrax postal attack based on a careful postincident analysis of the 2001 postal attack. A mail-sorting machine is both a single point through which all mail passes (except locally routed rural mail and larger packages) and a nearly ideal device for expressing spores from all but the most tightly sealed envelops (because the sorting process compresses envelops), enabling the detection of spores by BDS.\n\nA comprehensive system for detection of a postal attack, however, would require additional components to monitor human health to detect individuals that become infected via envelops and packages that were either well sealed or not sorted by a monitored mail sorting machine. The additional components would have to detect (1) an individual case of anthrax in a recipient of a single envelop, (2) a cluster of cases in a home or office in which the envelop was opened, or (3) a pattern of individuals or building clusters that might indicate an attack that used multiple letters or packages. The system would also have to monitor for suspicious cases in local postal facilities not defended by locally installed sensors either directly or through sensing upstream of their facility in the mail processing network.\n\nAn analysis by Wagner et al. (2003b) identified two additional anthrax attack scenarios: building/vessel contaminations and premonitory release. Specifically, a building or vessel contamination refers to the distribution of anthrax (or other agent) via the mechanical components in a building or ship. This is a serious threat because of our modern reliance on heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems, which can effectively disseminate spores throughout a building. The functional requirement for time of detection is similar to that of an outdoor release because many individuals would be exposed simultaneously. Recognition of a release contained within a structure, however, produces somewhat different requirements. Specifically, the requirement is the detection of a cluster of illnesses common to a relatively small number of individuals sharing a domicile, a place of employment, or a social facility. This detection requires recognition and analysis of these relationships. A detection system ideally would have access to data about heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems, identity of occupants, and hours of occupation. The building contamination with B. anthracis of a postal facility in New Jersey during the 2001 postal attack is an interesting example for study (Greene et al., 2002) . Tracing the illnesses to the specific building required the knowledge of work times, responsibilities, and routines for a large number of postal workers.\n\nThe term premonitory release refers to intentional or accidental infection of one or a limited number of individuals with an unusual organism such as B. anthracis. The functional requirement here is one of sensitivity for single cases and small outbreaks, not extreme timeliness. To detect a single case, a biosurveillance system must have extremely high case detection sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic precision (or the prior probability must be extremely high, e.g., owing to intelligence information). A biosurveillance system would have to rely either on case detection by the healthcare system or on computer-based case detection. Computer-based case detection would have to be capable of diagnostic precision at least at the level of finding individuals with Gram-positive rods in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid and pneumonia on chest radiograph (which would be highly suggestive of anthrax). Examples of potential computer-based components include clinical information systems with decision support at the point of care, systems to monitor laboratory reporting of microbiology cultures; and flee-text processing algorithms that scrutinize autopsy reports, newspaper stories, and obituaries for unusual deaths of animals or humans. If there are multiple cases, the demographics of the victims or the discovery of a geographic clustering of victims could help to identify a common cause with case detection at lower levels of diagnostic precision. In the absence of astute clinical diagnosis, it is likely that a single case of disease caused by a weaponized organism will progress to fatality. The requirements, therefore, include biosurveillance components (manual or automatic) that analyze unexplained deaths.\n\nThe problem of detecting a single case is identical to the problem of accurate diagnosis in medicine, and there is great deal of literature on clinical decision support describing relevant techniques, which is summarized in Miller (1994) .\n\nA designer of a comprehensive biosurveillance system for a city or a country would have to elucidate functional requirements for detection of hundreds of biological agents that can cause disease in animals and humans (and, through mutation, the number continues to expand). As in the case of anthrax, many of these agents can infect humans or animals through diverse pathways (amplified by the ingeniousness of terrorists), resulting in an almost infinite variety of outbreaks that a biosurveillance system must be capable of recognizing in a timely manner. This section provides but a sample of these biological agents, those identified by international and national organizations as being of the greatest concern. Our purpose in this section is to indicate the magnitude and complexity of the design problem. Table 4 .2 is a list of biological agents that we created by consolidating lists developed by internationally recognized organizations and experts. Five of the primary sources listed bioterrorism threats; the sixth, nationally notifiable diseases (Wagner et al., 2003b) . We sorted the list by the number of lists each threat appeared on to bring the consensus threats to the top. Note that several of the viral entries in the table represent classes of viruses that contain many individual viruses (e.g., the entry alphaviruses includes Venezuelan, eastern, western, and equine encephalomyelitis) \n\nX X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X A list X Top 4 X X A list X Top 4 X X A list X Top 4 X X A list X Top 4 X X A list X X X X A list X X X B list X X X B list X X X B list X X X B list X X X B list X X B list X X A list X X C list X X X B list X B list X X X X B list X B list X B list X B list X X X X X X X X X X X C list X C list X C list X C list X X X X X X This\n\nThe Office International des Epizooties (OIE) is the world organization for animal health (see Chapter 7) The OIE sets guidelines and provides recommendations to minimize the risk of the spread of animal diseases and pests while facilitating trade between nations. The OIE develops policy, standards, and techniques that member countries can apply to help protect themselves from animal diseases by establishing valid import barriers for the trade of certain animals or animal products. The OIE documents these standards in the International Terrestrial Animal Health Code and the International Aquatic Animal Health Code (Office International des Epizooties, 2004a,b). These standards include lists of diseases, organized by priority. Table 4 .3 includes a selection of OIE diseases that produce high morbidity/mortality, spread rapidly, and can easily cross national boundaries. These diseases represent the greatest potential to disrupt international trade. These diseases (formerly called List A diseases) can produce significant socioeconomic upheaval or present a major public health risk; therefore, OIE establishes more stringent requirements for demonstrating freedom from the disease agent.\n\nThe OIE also lists diseases that cause significant socioeconomic disturbance or health risk within an affected country but generally do not cross national boundaries (Table 4 .4). These diseases (formerly called List B diseases) are associated with requirements for reporting and demonstrating freedom from the disease or agent that are less severe than those for the pandemic agents described above; nonetheless, they are still quite restrictive.\n\nCommercial farming and trade of aquatic animals is increasing dramatically. The aquatic environment provides unique transmission modes for disease. Therefore, the OIE has developed an Aquatic Animal Code (Table 4 .5). OIE includes diseases based on the potential for international spread and the potential for transmission to humans.\n\nAlthough to our knowledge no organization has attempted to develop functional requirements for an \"all-biological threats\" system, it makes for an interesting gedanken experiment (thought experiment), which may reveal whether such a system can even be specified given the large number of organisms and variability in their presentation, or how such a specification might best be accomplished.\n\nTo design an all-threats system, a designer would have to speak with many disease experts to understand the requirements for each disease. In particular, the designer would have to understand the required timeliness of detection for each disease and the smallest size outbreak that should be detected. Just understanding these functional requirements for all biological agents would be an enormous undertaking and would only represent a first step in the development of a system specification, which would require additional analysis for each threat of the types of surveillance data and analytic methods that could satisfy the requirements at lowest cost and effort.\n\nThere is another way, however, to manage this design complexity, which is to identify a smaller number of general \"patterns\" that a biosurveillance system must be capable of recognizing. This idea is not terribly new; the field has appreciated the disease-independent value of looking for patterns ever since John Snow used a spatial pattern of cases to elucidate the cause of a cholera outbreak in London in 1854 (Snow, 1855) . What is novel here is taking that idea to its logical conclusion, which entails systematically examining all threats (biological agents and their various presentations as outbreaks) to identify a set of patterns (more multidimensional than spatial patterns) that most or ideally represent all of the patterns that a biosurveillance system must be capable of recognizing. Table 4 .6 is the result of such an analysis conducted by Wagner et al. (2003b) for the diseases listed in Table 4 .2. Note that the following discussion relates only the threats to human health. A similar analysis would be required for diseases that threaten only animals.\n\nThe analysis resulted in a final set of nine patterns, each of which represents a fundamentally different pattern recognition problem for a biosurveillance system. For example, large-scale aerosol releases, in general, have the same requirements for a large-scale aerosol release of B. anthracis described above. Building contaminations in general have the same requirements as described for a building contamination with B. anthracis. They also searched the literature for actual outbreaks of diseases in each category for which detailed descriptions were available for study by system designers.\n\nThe previous section on the functional requirements and specifications for anthrax biosurveillance already discussed the first three of the nine patterns in Table 4 .5. We discuss the other six patterns in the following sections.\n\nThe fourth pattern is that produced by a continuous or intermittent release of an infectious agent or biologic toxin over time. Under such conditions, individuals entering a limited area develop disease over an extended period. The Philadelphia Legionnaires outbreak was of this type, as would have been the attempt by the Aum Shinrikyo cult to sicken the population of Tokyo by disseminating continuously liquid anthrax slurry over a period of 4 days from the rooftop of their building, had it succeeded (Mangold and Goldberg, 2000) . Pets and birds were sickened, but no human cases were reported.\n\nEarly detection of this type of outbreak would require analysis of surveillance data both spatially and temporally, that is, searching for clusters of diseases or syndromes in both space and over time. This pattern requires a different kind of manipulation of epidemiological data, such as the use of detection algorithms based on cumulative sums or cut point statistics. It also requires detection algorithms capable of searching a large space of possible time intervals and spatial locations. Several chapters in Part III of this book discuss such algorithms.\n\nThe fifth pattern results from person-to-person transmission of a contagious disease, such as influenza, SARS, measles, or rubella (German measles). The timeliness requirement for this type of outbreak is not paramount because people become infected in waves. The recognition of this pattern involves biosurveillance components capable of collecting and analyzing social networks and contact information.\n\nThe sixth pattern is contamination of commercially distributed products, especially food. Food contamination may be as simple as contamination at the site of preparation, which is what the Rajneesh cult attempted in The Dalles, Oregon, or as involved as tampering with distribution or production facilities (Torok et al., 1997) . The timeliness requirement may be anthrax-like, as many individuals can be infected nearly simultaneously. Improving the timeliness of detection of threats in this category requires biosurveillance components that can monitor the food supply directly for contamination. It also requires components that can correlate patterns of disease in a population with knowledge of food production and distribution systems. (Torok TJ et al., 1997) Large community outbreak of cryptosporidiosis due to contamination of a filtered public water supply (Hayes EB et al., 1989 ) Outbreak of West Nile-like viral encephalitis, New York (CDC, 1999b,c) Cluster of HIV-positive young women, New York, 1997 -1998 (Anonymous, 1999 These analyses must be longitudinal to detect intermittent or ongoing contaminations and must consider that many foods can be stored for relatively long periods before consumption.\n\nThe seventh pattern is contamination of the water supply (well or surface water), as illustrated by the example of cryptosporidium in Chapter 2. The timeliness requirement may be \"anthrax-like,\" as a cohort of individuals can be exposed nearly simultaneously. To achieve the required timeliness of detection, a surveillance system would require in-line monitoring of the water system for contamination, as well as components that correlate the spatial distribution of disease data with the branching anatomy and vulnerabilities of the water supply system, to allow a subtle increase in cases to be noticed as early as possible.\n\nThe eighth pattern results from disease transmission through an intermediate, nonhuman vector, such as mosquitoes or even contaminated blood products. Similar to diseases that are contagious and passed from human to human, outbreaks of this type do not have anthrax-like timeliness requirements. Detection of outbreaks in this category, however, requires that a biosurveillance system monitor for the presence of organisms in vectors (e.g., mosquitoes and blood products). It must also be capable of collecting and analyzing data about sick individuals and their exposures to vectors to find clusters of cases that otherwise would not be apparent above the background level of disease.\n\nThe ninth and final pattern is that caused by a disease transmitted through sexual or other intimate contact, such as the sharing of needles. This pattern resembles the contagious person-toperson pattern, but the analysis separated this pattern because the data collection enabling the analysis of sexual contact patterns is difficult, requires sensitivity, and may infringe on legal rights. A key detection problem raised by this category is identifying a carrier who is infecting other individuals (either intentionally or unintentionally). The timeliness requirement is not severe, as illustrated by AIDS, but the difficulty in detecting cases and identifying contacts is high.\n\nThe goal of the above analysis was to identify a set of patterns that would dramatically reduce the complexity of designing biosurveillance systems. By using these patterns, a system designer avoids the paralysis induced by the complexity of developing specifications for hundreds of organisms. Each of these nine patterns represents an important and different problem in detection. This set of patterns may be more useful to system designers than are priority lists, as in Table 4 .2. Table 4 .2 does not identify explicitly requirements to detect premonitory cases, building contaminations, or continuous releases; hence, a designer may overlook these requirements if Table 4 .2 is used.\n\nWagner and colleagues noted that five of the nine patterns happen to correspond to organizational divisions within governmental public health (sexually transmitted, communicable, vector-borne, water-borne, foodborne disease). They conjectured that the specialization that has occurred in governmental public health (in response to complexity) over the years might have been shaped by similarities among diseases, especially with respect to the types of data and analyses required to detect and characterize outbreaks of these diseases.\n\nIt is worth noting that four of the nine patterns do not correspond to organizational divisions in health departments (large-scale aerosol release, small premonitory release, building contamination, and continuous or intermittent release). This observation suggests that these patterns may require special attention. We note that the Department of Homeland Security is addressing the large-scale aerosol release, and the U.S. Postal Service is addressing the problem of building contamination-at least for the tiny subset of buildings in the United States that they own.\n\nIt is also worth noting that designers can benefit from focusing their attention on an even smaller subset of patterns. Two patterns--the communicable person-to-person and the largescale release pattern--cover many of the design issues raised by the larger set of patterns (Wagner et al., 2003a) .\n\nAs we discuss in Parts II and IV, a system designer has a large selection of surveillance data from which to construct a biosurveillance system. This abundance is a result of the increasing amounts of data collected electronically about the health of individuals and their purchasing, travel, attendance, and other behaviors (Sweeney, 2001) .\n\nFor a designer, the task of data selection may be simple or complex. It is simple if the organization planning a system requests that the designer automate the collection of data that the organization is already receiving. It may be quite challenging if the organization specifies an engineering goal of earlier detection and leaves it to the designer to select data. In part, the designer's difficulty stems from the current lack of full understanding of the value of many of these types of data. The designer must weigh whether data can meet functional requirements for timeliness and accuracy of detection, the availability of the data, and the cost and efforts to acquire the data. Cost and effort may be dominant factors for data that either require effort on the part of many individuals or organizations to obtain the data, or data that are distributed among many computer systems, especially if the biosurveillance system will monitor at the national or international level. The chapters in Parts II and IV of this book provide detail about data availability and the cost and effort to obtain different types of data.\n\nThe complexity of the design process is further increased by the amount of data that must be specified, especially for a system that supports outbreak characterization. The data may include data about human health, animal health, environmental data, locations, and relationships of people. Just the data potentially needed to diagnosis a single sick human are staggeringly large-there are more than 4,000 symptoms and laboratory tests that bear on the diagnosis of disease in humans.\n\nAppendix A provides tables that may be useful to system designers. This appendix contains tables of surveillance data that have been pivotal in detecting and characterizing outbreaks in the past, data that are required to satisfy published case definitions, and data currently being collected routinely for biosurveillance by governmental public health. The tables also include types of data that may be very early indicators of diseases, identified by a review of the literature on health psychology, especially the subliterature relevant to behaviors of ill individuals between the onset of symptoms and presentation (if ever) for medical care. The tables also identify data systems that routinely collect the data either for the purposes of biosurveillance or, more typically, for other purposes.\n\nBecause of a new requirement for biosurveillance (very early detection of disease outbreaks), biosurveillance systems are undergoing a process of re-engineering and de novo construction. Designers of biosurveillance systems have an opportunity to adopt a more formal engineering approach that begins with specification of functional requirements. At this time, the understanding of such requirements for most diseases, however, is incomplete. There is a general recognition that systems should detect outbreaks \"as early as possible\"; however, this level of specification is less than ideal because designers must consider many tradeoffs between earliness and cost when designing systems. A designer may simplify the process of functional requirement specification by recognizing that a relatively small number of patterns can guide this process. The state of the art in functional requirement definition for biosurveillance is \"perhaps the end of the beginning,\" as Winston Churchill so aptly put it.\n\nThis chapter is also the end of the beginning. We continue our discussion of the design of biosurveillance systems in Part II by reviewing the organizations that participate in biosurveillance and their missions. Part III discusses newer data analytic methods, Part IV considers new types of surveillance data that designers may consider, and Part V addresses the question of how biosurveillance systems can be designed to support decision making. We finally return explicitly to the topic of building biosurveillance systems in Part VI. 3a MHOH, ql/IraTerlb! [Follow me, reader!] (Bulgakov, 2001) . "}
