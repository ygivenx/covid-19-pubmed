{"title": "Synthesis of 4-hydroxy-1-methylindole and benzo[b]thiophen-4-ol based unnatural flavonoids as new class of antimicrobial agents q", "body": "The clinical relevance of fungal diseases has increased enormously in the second half of the 20th century, mainly because of an increasing population of immunocompromised hosts, including individuals infected with HIV, transplant recipients and patients with cancer. 1, 2 The fungal threat will continue to increase, as shown by the occurrence of aspergillosis in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 3 and by the inclusion of Coccidioides immitis as a potent agent of bioterrorism. 4 The crude mortality from opportunistic fungal infections still exceeds 50% in most human studies and has been reported to be as high as 95% in a bone marrow transplant recipients infected with Aspergillus spp. 5 During our continuing efforts to identify antifungal leads from plant sources we have isolated furanoflavonoids from Pongamia pinnata fruits. 6, 7 These compounds possess various kind of biological activities. 8 Among the compounds isolated by us most prominent were karanjin, and pongamol. Karanjin has been reported to be hypoglycemic, 9 antifungal, 10 synergist to insecticides, antifeedent 11 and pongamol has antimicro-bial 12 activity and is used commercially in cosmetic and sun-screen preparations. 13 The adequate treatment of mycotic infections is difficult since fungi are eukaryotic organisms with a structure and metabolism that is similar to those of eukaryotic host. For this reason, there is a need to design new compounds with good antifungal activity. Therefore, in order to explore the potential of furanoflavonoid nucleus as antifungal and antibacterial agents we have devised an easy and efficient methodology to introduce novel pyrrole and thiophene anellated mimics to furanoflavonoids as their heterocyclic counterparts.\n\nVarious methods in the literature regarding synthesis of furanoflavonoids reveal that these compounds can be synthesized from degradation product of furanoflavonoids, that is, karanjic acid or total synthesis can be achieved starting from cyclohexane-1,3-dione involving multisteps leading to furanoflavonoids. 14 These methods cannot be applied as such to the nitrogen and sulfur heterocyclic mimics of furanoflavonoids. Nitrogen can be inserted to the 4-oxo-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzofuran (1) through ammonolysis whereas sulfur heterocyclic mimics can not be generated from 1 as they lack any possible step where sulfur can be inserted to the benzofuranoid nucleus. Corresponding sulfur motif 6, thiophen-4-one (3) can be generated from thiophene and succinic anhydride as depicted in the retrosynthetic scheme. There is no literature report for synthesis of these key intermediates as well as the final compounds. \n\nWe initiated our studies by preparing starting 4-oxo-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzofuran (1) . Easy and efficient methods are available for synthesis of 2-substitutedtetrahydrobenzofurans, but these methods can only be applied for synthesis of 2,3-dihydro-2-substituted-tetrahydrobenzofurans due to their limitations. 15, 16 Recent studies have shown use of rhodium acetate in dipolar cycloaddition of diazacyclohexane-1,3-diones with vinyl acetates followed by acid catalyzed dehydration to produce 1 in 41-71% yield. 17 Our attempt to synthesize 1, commenced from commercially available cyclohexane-1,3-dione as shown in Scheme 1. Aqueous solution of cyclohexane-1,3-dione was stirred with bromoacetaldehyde in presence of catalytic amount of TBAI and pH 6-7 was maintained by addition of sodium bicarbonate. After 6 h the reaction mixture was subjected to acid catalyzed dehydration to afford 1 in 78% yield. 18 The synthesis of key intermediate 2 (Scheme 1) was achieved in quantitative yields by ammonolysis of tetrahydrobenzofuran (1) with methyl amine in aqueous ethanol contained in a sealed tube at 150\u00b0C for 14 h. 19 As depicted in the retrosynthetic scheme, sulfur can be inserted to the key intermediate while starting our strategy from thiophene. Friedel-Crafts acylation of thiophene with succinic anhydride catalyzed by Lewis acid AlCl 3 and subsequent reduction of carbonyl group by Clemmensen reduction, thereafter conversion of free acid to acid chloride and again Friedel-Crafts acylation afforded 3 in 64% overall yield as shown in Scheme 2. 20 Enolate of 2/3 was generated with NaH and catalytic amount of KH followed by coupling with ethyl acetate and dimethyl carbonate in refluxing DME produced 4-7 (80-94%). Compound 4 and 5 existed as keto-enol tautomers (9:1), as indicated from 1 H NMR spectra. Thereafter, DDQ mediated dehydrogenation of 4-7 in refluxing dioxane, afforded 8-11 (64-85%) (Scheme 3). 14 Compound 16 and 17 were prepared in quantitative yield by methylation of the phenols 10 and 11 with methyl iodide and K 2 CO 3 in acetone (Scheme 5).\n\nThe synthesis of corresponding chalcones 12-15 were achieved in good yield by subjecting intermediates 8/9\n\nto Claisen-Schmidt condensation with substituted benzaldehydes in presence of barium hydroxide in ethanol (Scheme 4).\n\nPropanedione analogue (18/19) ether (Scheme 5). Reaction was tried with different bases (NaH, KH, t BuOK) and solvents (THF, DME) but no improvement in yield was observed. Further esters 10/ 11 were treated with dimsyl anion in DMSO to form the b-ketosulfoxide 20/21 (Scheme 5), which on treatment with benzaldehydes and piperidine in dry toluene first at 40\u00b0C for 2 h, then at 110\u00b0C for 1 h, produced corresponding flavone analogues 22-24 (65-76%). 14 Synthesis of corresponding flavonols were achieved by Algar-Flynn-Oyamada reaction (AFO) 21 of chalcones 12-15. Reaction of sulfur heterocyclic chalcones (14 and 15) were neat and produced flavonol 25 and 26 in good yields, whereas, AFO reaction of nitrogen anlogue (12) was not efficient and chromatographic purification of products revealed formation of flavonol analogue 25 (30%) as major product along with two minor products flavanone 28 (3%) and flavanonol 29 (5%) (Scheme 6), whereas with chalcone 13 reaction resulted in complex mixture of products.\n\nThe minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of each compound was determined against test isolates using broth micro-dilution technique as described by the NCCLS. 22 On the contrary compound 12 showed mild activity against bacteria and fungi. Most of the compounds have shown good antifungal activity against Trichophyton mentagrophytes but compound 19, 22 and 12 exhibited good activity against each fungal isolate. It can be inferred from the activity results that substitution by sulfur has produced better results as compared to the nitrogen analogues as revealed from activities of chalcones 12-15, propanediones (18/19) and flavonols 25-27, whereas nitrogen analogue for flavone 22 was more active then its sulfur counterpart 24. Methoxy substituted analogues for all these compounds in general have shown decrease in activity. Two of the compounds 12 and 19 also had some antibacterial activity (Table 1) .\n\nIn conclusion we have accomplished synthesis of novel pyrrole and thiophene anellated flavonoid analogues of furanoflavonoids, all the final compounds including intermediates 4-11 are new and synthesized for the first time. Synthesized compounds were evaluated for antifungal and antibacterial activities. Biological studies of heterocyclic analogues of these compounds have revealed that substitution of the heterocyclic oxygen by sulfur has produced marked increase in the antifungal activity, as indicated by activity profile of the compound 19.
