{"title": "Harnessing the privatisation of China's fragmented health-care delivery", "body": "China has pledged to provide aff ordable, equitable access to quality basic health care for all its citizens by 2020. To achieve this goal, China launched a nationwide systemic reform in 2009, supported by infusions of substantial public funding. The reform marked a departure from the market-oriented strategy used after the liberalisation of the economy in 1978, and re-instated the government's role in the fi nancing of health care and provision of public goods. In only 4 years, the reform produced substantial positive results in expansion of insurance coverage and strengthening of the infrastructure of primary health-care facilities, but much still needs to be done to reform China's health-care delivery. Particularly, China faces major challenges in transformation of its underperforming hospital-centric, fragmented system into one that delivers high-quality and effi cient care to meet the emerging health needs and rising patient expectations associated with rapid ageing, environmental deterioration, urbanisation, and other socioeconomic transformations.\n\nAn addition to this ongoing challenge is the government's latest decision to open up the hospital sector for private investment, signalling a major swing back towards the market along the government-market pendulum guiding health-care policy.\n\nWhat are the implications of a pro-market policy on China's health-care delivery system, in view of the fact that China already has a very hospital-centred system dominated by public hospitals mainly driven by profi t? What alternative pathways might China consider if it were to achieve its health-policy goals? In this Review, we aim to provide informed speculative answers to these questions, using social policy and economic theories, China's past experiences, and international lessons.\n\nWe provide an update on China's 2009 reform, the progress and challenges of the reform, and the government's latest plans. We then suggest a more costeff ective and high-quality health-care delivery approach as a rational direction for China to aim for, discuss whether China is on track towards this vision, and what alternative pathways it might consider.\n\nIn response to growing public discontent with unaff ordable access to health care, little fi nancial risk protection from out-of-pocket spending on health, and a\n\n\u2022 China's 2009 reform has produced substantial results in expansion of insurance coverage, but unless the wasteful and ineffi cient delivery system is reformed, China cannot achieve aff ordable and equitable access to quality health care for all its citizens \u2022 Privatisation of an already profit-driven public hospital sector combined with a hospital-centric fragmented delivery system would result in health-care expenditure escalation, with patients bearing increasing costs; a two-tiered system in which access and quality of care are decided by ability to pay; and poor population health outcomes \u2022 Benchmark competition between public and private sectors, with public hospitals reformed to pursue the public interest and be held accountable for population outcomes, off er an alternative pathway to steer China back on course to achieve its health-policy goals \u2022 Objective monitoring and assessment are essential to support evidence-based reform, and any decision to further expand the for-profi t private hospital market should not be made without objective assessment of its eff ect on China's health-policy goals severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that emphasised weaknesses in the health-care system, China took a giant step to reform its health sector in 2009. Guided by the principle of equity, the reform departed from the previous market approach and re-instated the government's role in health care, increasing annual public spending from \u00a5481\u00b76 billion to \u00a5836\u00b76 billion (US$1 is roughly equal to \u00a56\u00b75) between 2009 and 2012. 1 Before the reform, there was heated debate about whether additional government funding should be given as a direct budget to the providers (supply-side approach) or channelled through insurance programmes that then purchase services from providers (demand-side approach). The government decided that most additional fi nance should be used to subsidise rural and urban residents not already covered by the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) programme to enrol in the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) or the Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance programme (URBMI), respectively. The government also directly paid primary health-care providers to deliver a defi ned package of public health services. This, together with the services covered by these three health insurance programmes (hereafter referred to as social health insurance [SHI] ), constitutes the basic health care fi nanced by the government. To strengthen the primary health-care networks, the reform invested in infrastructure and provider training, and established the Essential Medicine Program to improve the safety, quality, and effi ciency of primary health-care services. Finally, unable to decide on\n\nExpand health insurance coverage\n\nThe government subsidises each rural and urban resident not covered by the UEBMI programme to enrol in the NCMS or the URBMI, respectively By now, NCMS, URBMI, UEBMI together cover more than 96% of the population Service coverage has gradually been expanded from its initial focus on hospital admission to include outpatient services. Chronic diseases and major disorders that incur high expenditures have also been prioritised for reduced copayment a viable strategy to reform public hospitals, the government initiated various pilots. 2 The 12th 5-Year Plan for Health (12th FYP), announced in 2012, reconfi rmed the government's commitment to the ongoing reform and set new targets for 2015, including further increases in government funding for NCMS, URBMI, and public health services; continued improvements in primary health-care infrastructure and training of general practitioners; and an expansion of the essential drugs list. The government is moving towards integration of all three existing insurance programmes, starting with the NCMS and URBMI schemes initially, to increase risk pooling and equalise benefi t packages. 3 Table 1 describes the 2009 reform, its progress and challenges, and the government's short-term plans. [2] [3] [4] [5] At present, 96% of the population is covered by one of the three insurance schemes. However, progress in service delivery reform has been slow. Despite substantial investment in infrastructure and training at the primary health-care level, visits and admissions continue to take place mainly at secondary and tertiary hospitals. 6 Primary health-care facilities have not been able to perform a gate-keeping function, and health-care delivery remains hospital-centred and fragmented. Public hospital reform has been stymied. Pilots in 17 cities yielded few lessons for guiding policy formulation. Premier Li Keqiang described China's health-care reform as having entered the \"deep water zone\", especially in reference to the diffi culties of reformation of profi t-driven public hospitals. 7 Between 2007 and 2012, real per capita total health expenditure and gross domestic product increased at annual rates of 14\u00b79% and 10\u00b72%, respectively. 1 Subsequently, although expansion of health insurance coverage has led to increases in insurance reimbursement, it has neither reduced illness-related fi nancial burdens faced by households nor improved quality of care. 2, 8 If health expenditure continues to grow unabated, the sustainability of the insurance programmes will be at risk, with patients ultimately bearing the cost.\n\nThe 12th FYP set forth a programme for the reform of public hospitals, including delinking drug sale revenue from staff remuneration, changing of provider payment methods, testing of alternative corporate governance structures, improvement of supervision of quality and rational drugs, and use of more effi cient management, 4,5 most of which have been initiated in the 2009 reform pilots.\n\nThe most striking announcement is the government's decision to promote private investment in the hospital sector, with the target of private hospitals reaching a 20 percent market share by 2015. 4, 5, 9, 10 Although not made explicit, the motivation behind privatisation can be interpreted partly as a strategic move to use private sector competition to stimulate changes in the otherwise stymied public hospital reform, partly as a swing back in government ideology towards a more pro-market approach to improve productivity in the health sector, and partly naively treating the health sector as another sector to boost the economy. The rationale of the 20% target and whether the government intends further market expansion beyond 2015 remains unknown. Companion policies putting private hospitals on equal footing with public hospitals are being introduced-eg, the three insurance schemes would contract with private hospitals, and physicians working in the private hospitals would qualify for promotion within the medical professional ranking system. 11 At the same time, no new building projects or expansion of public hospital beds will be approved. How the government plans to regulate the private hospitals and, more importantly, can regulations be eff ectively enforced in the Chinese context, are both open questions at the moment. Overall, whether additional government fi nancing would produce eff ective health care that serves the needs of its population depends crucially on whether China can fi nd a workable and sustainable strategy to reform its delivery system.\n\nSimilarly to other emerging economies, China faces increasing pressure on its health-care system from a combination of demographic, environmental, economic, and epidemiological forces 12 (appendix). With a population increasingly aff ected by non-communicable diseases and disabilities associated with ageing, 13-16 a more cost-eff ective approach of delivery is a primary health-care-centred integrated delivery model, which focuses on population-based prevention, health promotion, and disease management, with functioning coordination between primary, secondary, and tertiary health-care providers, and possibly links to social care. In this approach, primary health care plays a central part in prevention, case detection and management, gatekeeping, referral, and care coordination.\n\nThe primary health-care-centred integrated delivery model can take many structural and organisational forms. They can range from fully integrated models that combine primary health care and hospital services into one delivery system that includes all aspects of care for a defi ned population, to the more common disease management programmes, which are narrower approaches to co ordinated care with a focus on population groups with specifi c health conditions. Unlike fully integrated models, disease management programmes do not usually include major structural changes to the health-care system. Instead, they integrate care decisions usually through a care coordinator (for the purpose of this Review, we do not diff erentiate integrated and coordinated care). 17, 18 There are also attempts to integrate medical and social care for an ageing population with multimorbidities. 19 Panel 1 describes existing evidence on the eff ects of integrated care. The scientifi c literature shows that See Online for appendix integrated care encompasses a wide range of interventions whose eff ects are dependent on the specifi c design of the programme and the contexts in which they are implemented. A synthesis of evidence from 19 systematic reviews suggests that available evidence \"points to a positive impact of integrated care programmes on the quality of patient care and improved health or patient satisfaction outcomes but uncertainty remains about the relative eff ectiveness of diff erent approaches and their impacts on costs\". 31 However, it remains \"challenging to interpret the evidence from existing primary studies, which tend to be characterised by heterogeneity in the defi nition and description of the intervention and components of care under study\". 31 The authors also emphasise the importance of assessment of integrated care as a complex strategy to innovate and implement long standing change in service delivery that includes several changes at many levels, rather than one intervention. 31 The state of knowledge on integrated care is still in its early stages. In practice, there is no single model of the primary health-care-centred integrated delivery model that would fi t all nations. Many countries (even those with advanced economies) still experiment with models that suit their contexts best. However, a primary health-care-centred integrated delivery model, that focuses on population-based prevention and care coordination off ers a rational course for China to pursue given the changing needs of its population. Similar to other nations that have embarked on this course, China would have to innovate and discover its own model,\n\nIntegrated care schemes diff er widely in the degree of integration, target population, and scope of interventions. 20, 21 Fully integrated models are uncommon. Kaiser Permanente and the Veterans Health Administration (VA) in the USA are rare examples. Findings from one study 22 showed that when Kaiser Permanente stratifi es its patients into levels of care and enrols high-risk patients into specifi c disease management programmes for more intensive case management, the percentage of hypertensive patients with blood pressure under control has more than doubled and admissions to hospital for coronary heart disease and stroke decreased by 30% and 20%, respectively, between 1998 and 2007. Findings from other studies showed that participants in the Care Coordination/ Home Telehealth programme for diabetes in the VA were 50% less likely to be admitted to hospital and 11% less likely to have an emergency room visit 1 year after enrolment. [23] [24] [25] However, these results were based on before and after comparisons.\n\nResults from assessments of disease management programme are mixed, in large part dependent on the specifi c programme designs, the population covered, and the contexts in which the intervention took place. Ofman and colleagues 26 reviewed 102 studies representing 11 chronic conditions to assess the clinical and economic eff ects of disease management. They identifi ed that in patients with depression, high cholesterol, cardiac insuffi ciency, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes, those who received coordinated care were more likely to see improvements than were patients in control groups who received normal care. 26 Gohler and colleagues 27 did a meta-analysis of 36 studies spanning 13 countries that compared the coordinated management with care of congestive heart failure and identifi ed a 3% reduction in mortality and an 8% reduction in re-hospitalisations, compared with regular care. Kruis and colleagues 28 reviewed randomised controlled trials assessing integrated disease management programmes for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and noted that integrated programmes reduced hospital admissions and length of stay but had no eff ect on mortality between comparison and control groups. However, another Cochrane review 29 on integration of services that are usually delivered through vertical programmes, such as HIV/AIDS, family planning, and maternal child health into primary health services in low-income and middle-income countries, showed no evidence of improved health-care delivery or health status. This Review diff ers from others in looking at integration of several services for diff erent health conditions in one health-care provider, rather than coordination of diff erent providers involved in treating one health condition. Similarly, the Medicare Coordinated Care Demonstration-a systematic assessment of disease management and care coordinationidentifi ed no diff erence in hospital admissions in 13 of 15 randomised controlled studies and no eff ect on Medicare expenditures overall between 2002 and 2006. However, the 15 selected host programmes diff ered widely in their organisational structure, target populations, and approach to coordination. The authors note the potential of replication of results from the two successful programmes by promotion of key programme features. These features included frequent in-person patient contact with coordinators, close ties between care coordinators and physicians, and links with local hospitals to ease the transition after hospital admission. 30 Examples of integrated care for elderly people include the North American Programme for All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) in the USA and the Torbay Care Trust in the UK. Although the fi rst targets elderly people who live in communities within a set service area, Torbay focuses on high-risk patients who need intensive ongoing support from community nurses and wider integrated teams. Both programmes experienced a decrease in inpatient and nursing home use, especially emergency visits, and an increase in home and community-based services. PACE also decreased Medicare costs in comparison to non-enrolees, whererase Torbay delivered improved system performance at no additional cost. 19 Generally, rigorous assessments of integrated care for the elderly population are scarce because many of them are relatively new.\n\naccompanied with objective and ongoing monitoring and assessment to allow for suitable adjustments along the way. Is China on track towards primary health-carecentred integrated delivery model under the status quo with increased privatisation of the hospital sector?\n\nChina's future health-care system under the status quo\n\nGenerally, primary health care in China is weak and its core functions in prevention, case detection and manage--ment, gate keeping, referral, and care coordinationessential for non-communicable disease prevention and control-are not being met. For instance, fi ndings from studies [32] [33] [34] showed that only 30\u00b71% 34 of adults with diabetes and 41\u00b76 32 -57\u00b74% 33 of adults with hypertension were aware they had the conditions. Few patients aware of their conditions receive treatment. Only 25\u00b78% 34 patients with diabetes, 34\u00b74 32 -49\u00b70% 33 of patients with hypertension, and 8% 35 of patients with mental health problems get treated; in patients with diabetes and hypertension who do get treated, less than half 32-34 get their condition under control. [32] [33] [34] [35] An international study 32 showed that the awareness, treatment, and control rates for hypertension were 41\u00b76%, 34\u00b74%, and 23\u00b78%, respectively in China, compared with 52\u00b75%, 48\u00b73%, and 32\u00b73% in the upper-middle income countries in the study. Furthermore, admission rates for complications from diabetes in China are more than fi ve times the rate in countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, a sign of poor primary health care. 14 A major challenge is how to transform primary health care delivery from an approach based on patients and episodes to a population-based approach. Increased funding and infrastructure, building are necessary, but not suffi cient to bring about this transformation. A reformed medical education curriculum and other innovative programmes to train a new cadre of modern primary health-care providers are needed. 36 However, how long this will take is unclear.\n\nPrimary health-care centres and hospitals in China operate independently and compete for patients. We predict that this situation will persist for several reasons. First, providers of all facility levels are mainly paid by fee-for-service, creating incentives to increase activities rather than improve patient health. Providers have no incentive to coordinate care with other health-care professionals because their fi nancial interest is to keep rather than refer patients to an appropriate site of treatment. The government has announced a shift from fee-for-service to other forms of provider payment, such as case-based payments, capitation, and global budget. However, they have so far been implemented as facility-specifi c rather than population-based payments, and therefore, do not provide incentives for several providers to coordinate care decisions. Second, fragmentation in fi nance creates barriers for the integration of services. Although primary health-care providers are mostly fi nanced by government subsidies to provide primary care, hospitals are paid by SHIs and patient out-of-pocket payments. Primary health-care facilities have no fi nancial leverage over hospitals. Third, in many cases SHI coverage is more generous for inpatient than outpatient services, incentivising patients to seek hospital care fi rst because, generally, patients do not trust the quality of primary health-care facilities. All these factors make it diffi cult for primary health care to have a gatekeeping role. Exacerbation of this situation means that, within the medical profession, specialists are held in high esteem, whereas primary health-care providers are not well respected, creating further barriers for them to have the care-coordinator role. Perhaps the greatest barrier to a primary health-care-centred integrated delivery model approach is the dominant profi t-driven hospital sector, irrespective of whether the hospital is public or private.\n\nChina is starting to pilot some models of integrated care (panel 2). Because these pilots are ongoing, no assessment has been done yet. Instead, we compare features from the Chinese pilots with several facilitating characteristics that have emerged in reviewing of the international scientifi c literature about successful care integration. The most common features include provider and patient incentives, decision support for providers, information comm unication technology, and a clearly defi ned role for primary health care (table 2) . Although these pilots score well in movement towards an integrated health information system, they generally do not have appropriate providers and patient incentives and dedicated care coordinators. In fact, most Chinese pilots are led by tertiary hospitals and were set up to capture market share, with lower-level facilities agreeing to refer patients to them exclusively.\n\nUnlike most public hospitals in the world, Chinese public hospitals are an embodiment of both government and market failures. On the one hand, they are governed by bureaucratic rules and subject to confl icting policies from the many ministries that govern them. 2 Hospital directors and managerial staff are mostly government-appointed offi cials who are accountable to the government. 53 They do not have any autonomy over hiring and fi ring decisions, which are restricted by rigid Civil Service Rules. 54 On the other hand, public hospitals are motivated by profi ts and behave similarly to any other for-profi t organisation. They have built-in incentives to prescribe excessive diagnostic tests and pharmaceuticals to earn profi ts for distribution to physicians and fi nance hospital expansion. Most public hospitals have to earn 90% of their revenue from services provided, with government direct subsidies making up the rest. Meanwhile, the government sets fee schedules with prices for offi ce visits and hospital bed-days set below cost and the latest diagnostic and medical technologies set above cost. Providers are allowed to charge a 15% mark-up on drugs. Physicians are incentivised to prescribe drugs and tests that are not clinically needed because their bonuses are frequently tied to these revenues. [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] For these same reasons, hospital managers race to introduce high-tech services and expensive imported drugs to boost revenues. In this way, many public facilities act as private entities, putting profi t above patient welfare. 60, 61 To compound the problem, pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies provide hospitals and physicians with benefi ts for prescription of their products. All these have resulted in the large share of health expenditure spent on drugs in China. In 2011, expenditure on drugs as a share of total health expenditure was 43% percent compared with an OECD average of 16%, 62 and drug revenues accounted for 41\u00b74% of total hospital revenues. 6 Because physician staff are the residual claimants of profi ts in public hospitals, they are de facto shareholders of the public hospitals. Hence, public hospitals have neither the motivation nor the incentive to integrate care with primary health-care providers or make treatment decisions based on cost-eff ectiveness or population health maximisation criteria.\n\nHow would entrance of private hospitals aff ect the market dynamics? Although private hospitals are not new in China, their role in health-care provision has been small. In 2011, private hospitals accounted for just 10% of total hospital admissions. 6 Most are either high-end specialist hospitals that cater to the expatriate community and rich Chinese or small-scale hospitals providing elective services, such as cosmetic surgery for the general population. To reach 20% of market share by 2015 would mean rapid expansion. The policy announcement has since attracted a fl urry of interest from private investors.\n\nTrends so far suggest that most new entrants are motivated by profi t, most of whom are private hospital chains, pharmaceutical and medical device conglomerates, and real estate developers. Although strategies vary from targeting of provincial megacities to subprovincial urban centres, the emphasis has been on wealthier locations with strong household purchasing power and public insurance schemes that are more likely to cover a wider range of services. 63 Investors describe a two-pronged strategy-targeting of highend specialist hospitals that command high prices and buying of general public hospitals, typically contracted by SHI programmes, to maximise sale volume. 64 Although some investors are building their own facilities, increasingly they enter the market by buying existing hospitals so they can take over existing land and staff . Various joint ventures also seek prestige by association with brand-name medical universities (appendix).\n\nThe existing scientifi c literature about the eff ect of market competition on hospital effi ciency and quality has yielded mixed results depending on the institutional context. 65, 66 With few exceptions, most published work does not examine competition between diff erent ownership types. Investigators from a few studies noted that the presence of for-profi t private hospitals led to a positive spillover eff ect on public hospital effi ciency, 67, 68 whereas in others, it led to public hospitals bearing a bigger share of severely ill patients because for-profi t private hospitals limit their treatment to patients who are less severely ill 69 (appendix). Reviews comparing quality and cost of care of hospitals with diff erent ownership status have generally showed that for-profi t status is associated with higher costs and lower (or similar) quality than private non-profi ts, but the degree varies by studies' data sources, time periods, and regions covered. [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] Evidence in the management literature suggests that forprofi t private hospitals are more effi cient in management In 2005, Pudong district in Shanghai began to pilot the so-called 2 + 1 model, which integrates a secondary hospital with several community hospitals. Pioneered by the Waigaoqiao Medical Group, 37 this model includes Shanghai number seven People's Hospital and four community health centres. Patients who obtain referrals from the community health centres can get fast-track appointments at the hospitals.\n\nAnother common model is 3 + 2 + 1, which includes tertiary hospitals, secondary hospitals, and community health centres. This model is usually set up by a tertiary hospital. In principle, the head of the board of the network is usually a director from the tertiary hospital. The tertiary hospital takes the main responsibility for defi nition of the roles and responsibilities of each level of provider in the network. There are no explicit care coordination functions in these models. This model was piloted by two medical groups in Shanghai in 2011-Ruijin-Luwan and Xinhua-Chongming. Ruijing Hospital and the Xinhua Hospital Chongming Branch are the tertiary hospitals at the core of this three-tiered integrated delivery system. 38 They are supported by two secondary hospitals and several primary facilities. Around ten to 15 medical groups using the 3 + 2 + 1 model will be established in Shanghai and more than 20 in Beijing will be developed to cover the whole municipality. 39, 40 Because many of these pilots started not long ago or are still in the planning phase, there is no concrete evidence to show the eff ect of hospital integration. However, problems are emerging, particularly because of the bi-directional nature of referrals-in practice, only referrals to higher level hospitals work because of the relatively low-quality of care in primary hospitals. and that competition can lead to improvements in manage ment effi ciency gains. 77, 78 However, in the case of China, if public hospitals continue to be subject to bureaucratic governance, competition will unlikely translate to improvements in management.\n\nPublic-private hospital competition in China is more akin to competition between for-profi t hospitals. We speculate that private for-profi t hospitals entering the market would compete with established public hospitals off ering higher compensation to attract the best public sector physicians, and acquiring the latest expensive high-tech equipment to signal a higher quality of health care. The higher costs would be passed onto patients or SHI programmes. In response, public hospitals would have to raise the salaries of their own medical staff and enter the medical arms race, further detracting from a primary health-carecentred integrated delivery model approach.\n\nThis scenario predicts that entrance of private hospitals might exacerbate the excessive use of high-tech diagnostic tests and expensive pharmaceutical products so long as they generate profi ts, especially because patients are often unable to judge clinical quality of care. If the parent company of a private hospital were a pharmaceutical or medical device fi rm, incentives to overprescribe would be even more reinforced. 79 As the 12th FYP has identifi ed the biomedical industry as one of the seven strategic industries for stimulation of the economy, both pharmaceutical and medical device companies are making aggressive moves into China's market. 80 Although the government introduced a Certifi cate of Need policy in 2005 to regulate the purchase of expensive medical equipment, 81 it has not been enforced eff ectively. A study in four Chinese cities showed that the number of CTs and MRIs increased by 50% on average between 2006 and 2009. [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] Overall, our assessment suggests that China's prospect of provision of aff ordable and equitable access to health care with a primary health-care-centred integrated delivery model approach would be relatively dismal. The for-profi t motive of large public hospitals would result in escalation of health-care cost, ineffi cient use of pharmaceutical and high-tech diagnostic tests, and an absence of incentives for public hospitals to integrate care with primary health-care facilities. Entrance of private investment will further exacerbate these trends. To remain solvent, insurance programmes might limit payments, reduce resources for primary health-care services, and pass the higher costs on to patients as out-of-pocket costs. A two-tier system would emerge, with rich people serviced by the for-profi t private hospitals and another tier for the rest of the population, leading to unequal access to and quality of care. In the long term, population health outcomes would suff er while the burden of rising health-care expenditures continues to increase.\n\nIf the status quo does not lead China towards aff ordable, equitable, and eff ective health care for its people, what alternative pathway could it consider? In this section, we propose a way forward, taking into account what China has already embarked on, what is feasible in view of existing institutional constraints, and supplemented by international experience. We take as a starting point that the government will continue to fund basic health care, mainly through SHI, with some direct funding to primary health-care facilities and that it is highly unlikely that the government will reverse course to directly pay hospitals from government budgets; and that the for-profi t private hospital market share will continue to grow as a result of government policies and increased demand from a population with rising income. Therefore, the question is how to introduce systemic changes that would make the best use of these conditions, bearing in mind ongoing reform eff orts described in table 1. Figure 1 shows the systemic framework followed in our proposal. We fi rst discuss what the government might do to improve the organisation of health-care delivery and then how fi nancing and provider payment incentives could be used to further enhance improvements of delivery. Figure 1 provides a schematic representation of the various policy levers that could aff ect health-care delivery decisions, either independently or in combination with one another. The organisational features of the health sector-such as ownership, governance, market competition, level of integration, and norms of practice-all aff ect health-care delivery practices. Additionally, how health care is fi nanced and how providers are paid substantially aff ects treatment decisions because they create diff erent incentives for providers. Regulation could also be used, but its eff ect is often dampened by poor enforcement. Table 3 provides a brief description of the fi nancing, key organisational features, and provider payment methods used by selected Asian countries to put our proposal in the global context.\n\nWe propose that the government establish benchmark competition (a combination of norms and market forces) between public and private hospitals, with companion policies to reform the governance of public hospitals.\n\nFirst, the government would need to re-create exemplary models of public hospitals to serve as the benchmark. This is consistent with already announced government directives clarifying the role and objective of public hospitals to pursue the public interest 93,94 defi ned as \"making the most effi cient use of available public resources to maximize the benefi ts for the people-providing equal, accessible and quality healthcare to everyone\". 95 To achieve this objective, a new accountability system needs to be established to hold public hospitals accountable for delivery of cost-eff ective services on an equitable basis. To promote public hospitals to coordinate with primary health care, assessment can be based on a set of indicators that emphasises population-based prevention and management, quality of care, service provision to poor people, and patient satisfaction. Similar to the Hospital Foundation Trusts in England [96] [97] [98] and public hospitals in Hong Kong, 99 a board should be set up to which public hospitals are accountable to. Unlike existing boards in China, which mainly consist of government offi cials, they should be made up of representatives from local communities. Public\n\nDefi ned population or health conditions covered by the programme Fully integrated systems integrate primary and hospital care across an entire population. Disease management programmes attempt to do the same but focus on particular groups within the population that share certain characteristics, such as age, a common disease or condition, or a geographical area 21, 41 Most have defi ned population by geographical location but do not focus on a particular health condition 38, 39, [42] [43] [44] [45] Provider payment incentives to coordinate care\n\nBundled payments encourage care coordination by allocation of a fi xed fee to provide a full range of services for a defi ned population within a certain time period across providers at various facility levels Pay-for-performance components are also increasingly being used to reward or penalise primary care physicians for improved preventive care and chronic disease management 17, 21, 22, [46] [47] [48] [49] Most pilots do not include provider payment change. According to Shanghai's government guidance, social insurance is supposed to pay an integrated delivery network a global budget that covers all the providers within the network. To what extent it has been implemented is unclear 38, 39, [42] [43] [44] [45] Patient incentives Tiered reimbursement structures, referrals for specialist services, approvals for expensive diagnostic tests, and insurance discounts for engagement in health promotion activities or registering with accredited integrated delivery organisations motivate consumers to access the health-care system in the most cost-eff ective way 21, 41, 47 For most pilots, there is no diff erential tiered reimbursement schedule from SHI specifi cally developed to incentivise patients to use primary health care In some models, reimbursement rates for referred cases are higher than for non-referred cases In most models, obtaining referrals from community health centres fast tracks patients for appointments at higher-level hospitals 38, 39, [42] [43] [44] [45] Role of primary health care In several countries, registration with general practitioners is compulsory or highly incentivised fi nancially with primary care providers acting as gatekeepers to the wider health-care system Multispecialty medical groups are made up of doctors from a number of specialties who take on a budget to provide all or some of the services needed by the population that they serve Transitional care models redirect care from hospital settings back towards the community, shifting care from physicians towards more multidisciplinary teams that include nurses, therapists, and social care workers All service delivery setups include some kind of case management with primary health care at the centre 17, 41, 47 Most pilots are set up with the purpose of reduction of overcrowding at tertiary hospitals by redirecting patients to a lower level of facilities. They are not set up for care-coordination according to clinical protocols In most cases, community centres are supposed to play the gatekeeping role. Whether this has been successfully implemented is not known Primary health-care providers do not seem to play a core role in carecoordination. In fact, most of the networks are led by tertiary hospitals 38, 39, [42] [43] [44] [45] Decision support for providers Peer review, standardised care protocols, cross-disciplinary interactions, and training increasingly broadens the scope of various health-care professionals to act as patient care coordinators 26, 41, 46, 50 There is no explicitly defi ned care coordinator for the full continuum of services for a patient and period of time across the health facilities within the group Higher-level facilities second experts to the next lower level for training Whether there are multidisciplinary team based practice is unclear 38, 39, [42] [43] [44] [45] Health information system The use of standardised electronic health records that are interoperable across provider institutions is common in high performance integrated systems 21, 22, 25, 41 All have realised the essential role of health information technology in integrated care systems. Some integrated care groups (eg, Ruijin-Luwan), have established medical information exchange platforms and participated in information exchange across providers and care settings 38, 39, [42] [43] [44] [45] Enabling regulations Regulation and changes in organisational infrastructure facilitating the clinical integration of providers are less common and need strong government leadership and support from health-care professionals. Often what is necessary is a relaxation of regulations that impede clinical integration 41, 46, 48 The integration between providers has been impeded by some nationwide regulations. For instance, the number of health facilities where a doctor can practice is regulated (eg, three affi liations per doctor), which means that doctors cannot practice in all health facilities within a network. Also, there are regulations about what drugs each level of facility can dispense. If a patient is referred down to a community centre for rehabilitation, the community centre might not have the medicine that the patient needs. Some pilots are attempting to relax these restrictions 51, 52 SHI=social health insurance. General description Two-tiered system with the government directly funding public hospitals or clinics and the private sector fi nanced by a mix of direct out-of-pocket payment and private insurance and primarily serving the higher-income and middle-income groups. A hospital sector dominated by public providers and a primary care sector dominated by private clinics creates a barrier for service integration. Quality of care in the private sector is poorly regulated and highly variable\n\nThe National Health Insurance (NHI) covers 100% of the population with comprehensive service coverage. As a single-payer system, it is quite eff ective in controlling of health expenditure growth and assurance of equal access, however, there are quality and effi ciency weaknesses in service delivery hospitals would produce a quality report together with fi nancial statements on a quarterly basis for external audit and review. Hospitals that perform well would be publicly honoured and receive bonuses for their dedication to serving patient interests. Additionally, to improve effi ciency, the government should revamp the governance of public hospitals by giving hospital directors the autonomy to hire and fi re staff based on performance and to set up compensation and incentive schemes within their hospitals to align the staff 's incentives to pursue the public interest. Physicians should be paid a reasonable salary with the ability to earn extra bonuses based on the quality of care provided rather than the revenue generated, thus removing compensation from behaviour in prescription of drugs. This new scheme must be accompanied by a revision of the fee schedule that covers the cost of health services, removing the need to use profi t-making drugs and high-tech diagnostic tests as compensation for lost revenue. To do this, China needs to establish a standardised cost accounting system in all public hospitals.\n\nMaking these changes would be challenging. The government could consider selecting the most prestigious tertiary public hospital in all major cities to act as standard bearers in improvement of their governance structure, their management, and ultimately their performance. They would become the benchmark for other public hospitals to emulate. This strategy has already been used by Singapore. The Chinese Government is already advancing some of these policies and if further developed and appropriately implemented, we predict that in 10-15 years China would be able to establish at least one fl agship public hospital as a benchmark in each geographical market against which both public and private hospitals could compete. In the future, when not-for-profi t private hospitals enter with the objective to pursue the public interest, the government could also work with them to establish them as fl agships.\n\nHospital services in China can be conceptualised as two markets (fi gure 2). The fi rst, mainly funded by the government through SHI, would provide basic health care. The second, mainly funded by direct out-of-pocket payment and some private insurance, would consist of higher-end services (non-basic services). We anticipate that this market would increase over time with continuous technological advancements, rising consumer expectations for higher-end services, and a possibly slower rate of increase of government funding for health care as growth in GDP moderates. Public and private provision would coexist, although the private sector would largely be concentrated in urban areas providing hospital services.\n\nFor basic services, both public and private hospitals (should they choose to enter the market) would be fi nanced mainly by SHI schemes. The government should continue to increase funding for these services at an annual rate at least commensurate with GDP growth. The three SHI schemes would integrate, according to government plans, and be managed by one agency acting as a purchaser. International experience has shown that the more integrated the payers (or SHI schemes in this case), the more leverage they have to make changes in the delivery system. Canada, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea all have single-payer systems that have shown their ability to control health expenditure growth (table 3 ). In addition to integration, SHI would gradually become a more strategic purchaser. Chinese SHI's main objective is to balance costs with little concern for quality of care. The Ministry of Finance, as the fi nancier, should hold the purchaser accountable for the quality of care that they purchase for their enrolees.\n\nThis purchaser should contract public and private providers on equal terms, as is practised in other systems with universal health insurance, such as Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, and Canada (table 3) . The purchaser should move from paying hospitals by fee-for-service to population-based capitation payment, an all-inclusive payment per person, per year, for a defi ned and comprehensive scope of services. This form of bundled payment should provide incentives to contain costs, reduce unnecessary services, and encourage integration and coordination of services. 100 The payment will cover services that span across primary, secondary, and tertiary care. In the long-term when primary health-care facilities have developed their capacity, they could act as a budget holder and take primary responsibility as care coordinators. However, secondary level hospitals (equivalent to district hospitals elsewhere) could initially play this part because most primary health-care facilities in China might not have the necessary technical or managerial capacities initially. This method could be coupled with pay-for-performance, meaning that providers' compensations are tied to quality or patient outcomes. Evidence for performance-based \u2022 Services are mainly funded by the government, with moderate user copayments \u2022 Public and private providers compete on a level playing field and contracted by SHI schemes or a purchaser on equal terms \u2022 SHI or a purchaser pay providers by bundled payment, coupled with bonuses tied to quality improvements, to incentivise care coordination\n\n\u2022 Public hospitals only provide cost-effective services \u2022 Fees are charged according to a revised government schedule that covers cost \u2022 Two to three classes of wards are offered.\n\nClass A wards offering more conveniences and comfort (eg, a private room) would be charged at cost, whereas class C wards, offering less comforts, would be highly subsidised\n\n\u2022 Private providers freely set prices, choose services and quality to provide in competition with public hospitals payment is emerging, with their eff ectiveness dependent on designs and organisational contexts. [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] With population-based capitation, hospitals would fi nd it in their fi nancial interest to invest in health promotion and prevention, incorporate and coordinate with primary health-care facilities, and strengthen their functions within a multidisciplinary delivery setting as cost-saving strategies.\n\nFor non-basic services, which patients pay for directly out-of-pocket, the key question is how to improve effi ciency through competition while maintaining equity. Public hospitals would charge patients fees according to the government fee schedule (revised to cover actual costs) while private hospitals set their own prices subject to government regulation. However, to ensure that patients with a low income are able to aff ord these non-basic services, hospitals would off er two or three classes of wards, from which patients could freely choose. Services in diff erent wards would diff er only in amenities and waiting time for elective procedures, but not clinical quality. Patients in all wards would be treated by the same team of physicians. Similar to the Singaporean model, class A wards off ering more conveniences (eg, a private room) would be charged at cost, whereas class C wards off ering less comforts would be subsidised at a much higher percentage of cost to assure equal clinical quality of treatment. 108, 109 Continue to strengthen primary health care Needless to say, the government should continue its ongoing reform to strengthen primary health care, and fund and provide traditional public goods such as clean water, sanitation, and vector control, for which the private sector will neither fund nor provide. Additionally, for eff ective prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, the government should develop a multisectoral strategy that includes both targeted high-risk group identifi cation and population-wide interventions aimed at reduction of risk factors such as obesity, tobacco use, and sedentariness.\n\nFinally, we suggest that China allows civil society and community-based non-governmental organisations to complement public primary health-care providers in areas where the public sector is weak-eg, social services and home care for elderly people. Community-based organisations have been eff ective in the delivery of services in rural and poorer communities in low-income countries. 110\n\nChina's pledge to provide aff ordable, equitable access to quality basic health care for all its citizens is laudable, and present reforms have laid important foundations. However, substantial challenges in the reform of its delivery system, together with a new policy to promote private hospitals could derail China from achievement of its goals. The challenges that it faces are complex and there is no stand-alone policy that would provide the magic bullet. We suggest a systemic approach that integrates benchmark competition, improved public hospital accountability, stronger coordination across levels of care, and increased performance-based purchasing to leverage changes in health-care delivery towards a more cost-eff ective and high-quality system that serves the changing needs of China's population.\n\nChina is big and heterogeneous. Our recommendations are necessarily directional rather than operational. Each locale will have to modify and refi ne their specifi c models based on its conditions. Success will also depend on implementation conditions. The government should institutionalise objective monitoring and evaluation to support evidence-based mid-course adjustments. Particularly, China should assess how the entry of private hospitals aff ects its health-care system before it makes any decision to further expand their market share. Otherwise, China might not be able to rein in a runaway delivery system plagued with inequity and cost escalation.\n\nWY and WCH both contributed to the overall conceptualisation and analysis plan. WY took main responsibility for analysis of the scientifi c literature, synthesising of the fi ndings, and writing of the manuscript. Both authors contributed to the recommendation sections and have seen and approved the fi nal version.\n\nOur analysis is based on a review of published scientifi c literature. We undertook three main scientifi c literature searches for on the eff ect of hospital competition, ownership, and integrated or coordinated care. Search terms used included \"hospital competition\", \"hospital ownership\", \"public hospital\", \"private hospital\", \"not-for-profi t hospital\", \"integrated care\", \"coordinated care\", and \"disease management programs\" combined with \"cost\" or \"expenditure\" or \"health outcome\" or \"quality\". We limited results to articles, book chapters, or reports classifi ed as reviews. We excluded earlier reviews that were included in more recent papers. For subjects of which no reviews exist, we also reviewed individual studies. Database searches include PubMed, journal storage (JSTOR), Wiley Online Library, and Google Scholar. For coordinated or integrated care, we also searched the websites of organisations such as the King's Fund, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, the European Observatory, and the Commonwealth Fund. We further refi ned the results to chronic disease treatment or management. For descriptive reviews, we excluded reviews that included only one country. The search was complemented by references cited in relevant studies and suggestions from peer-reviewers. We included studies published between Jan 1, 1999 and June 17, 2014. For the examples of Chinese pilots of integrated care, we searched China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang for Chinese language papers using key words \"yi lian ti\" or \"yi liao lian he ti\" (in Chinese). Only papers in English and Chinese were used."}
