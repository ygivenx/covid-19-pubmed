{"title": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis pili (MTP), a putative biomarker for a tuberculosis diagnostic test", "body": "There is an urgent need to improve the laboratory turnaround time for the diagnosis of Mycobacteria [1] by the development of a point of care test that is also accessible to resource poor countries [2] . The lack of suitable biomarkers has hindered the development of diagnostic tests that meet all the criteria of a point of care test for the rapid detection of tuberculosis.\n\nBiomarkers, such as epitopes, molecules or genetic materials have been incorporated into assays capable of rapidly and inexpensively identifying active tuberculosis, distinguishing appropriate responses to anti-tuberculous drugs, and those at risk for disease progression [3] . The identification of biomarkers to distinguish among members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) comprising M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium bovis, M. bovis BCG, Mycobacterium microti and Mycobacterium canettii and non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) has been a challenge. This is due to the high similarity between the genomes of the MTBC members [4] . Examples include the >99.95% homology between M. bovis and M. tuberculosis genomes [5] . There have been conflicting reports on the ability to distinguish MTBC from NTM with the most widely studied potential biomarkers for MTB diagnosis, ESAT-6 and CFP-10 [6\u00c08].\n\nNumerous immunochromatographic tests have been evaluated for use as point of care tests, including few that are based on the MPB64 epitope [9e14], which include the Capilia TB and BIOLINE SD Ag MPT64 tests [12] . The MPB64 antigen is an immunogenic protein found in unheated cultures of M. tuberculosis [9,15e17] . These tests are based on detection from culture with the detection limit of 10.5 cfu/ml [12] . Since the production of this antigen is slow, it is not always detectable in liquid culture compared to solid media [10] . The ICT TB test is based on 5 M. tuberculosis antigens, including Antigen 85 and LAM [18, 19] . However, the ability of the ICT test to distinguish between MTBC and NTM has not been evaluated [18, 20] . Recently, ESAT-6/CFP-10 has been used in a nanoELIwell assay that integrates on chip culturing of cells, immunoassay and fluorescent imaging [8] . The advantages of this assay are high throughput and rapid culture. However, the sensitivity of this test would be reduced since ESAT-6 is secreted by many NTM [6e8]. An immunochromatographic test developed using both ESAT-6/CFP-10 complex showed high specificity and sensitivity of 97% and 97.4% respectively for MTBC organisms [21] . Despite the apparent high specificity and sensitivity compared to sputum smear and tuberculin skin tests, the study showed a greater chance of false negative and false positive results using these epitopes [21] .\n\nAdhesins, including pili, are the first point of contact with the host cell, helping overcome the net repulsive forces on the surfaces of the host and the pathogen [22] . Therefore, pili represent targets for use in diagnostics, including potential point of care tests. Two types of pili were discovered in M. tuberculosis [23] , namely Type IV pili, common to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [22] and archeal bacteria [24e27] and 'curli' pili, common to pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium [28, 29] . Type IV pili possess a hydrophobic amino terminus and a signal peptide [30, 31] . They are often observed under the electron microscope as long bundles of filaments, resembling rope-like structures or wicks [30, 31] . Curli pili are 2e5 nm wide, coiled and highly aggregative adhesive fibres. These structures are assembled using a nucleation pathway, requiring the major and minor pilin subunits [32] .\n\nThe curli pili of M. tuberculosis (MTP), encoded by the mtp gene (Rv3312A), has many attributes in common with curli pili of other bacteria [23] . They are highly sticky, aggregative and insoluble fibres that bind laminin [23, 33, 34] and Congo red dye and contain large numbers of glycine and proline residues. However, there is no similarity between the primary sequence homology of the protein subunits of MTP and curli pili of other bacteria [23] .\n\nMTP first identified and characterised by Alteri et al. (2007) , are produced during active human infection and facilitate binding to laminin on host cells [23] . Not all Mycobacteria produce pili, although this may be attributed to the response of Mycobacteria to different environmental indicators [30] . With access to complete Mycobacterial genomes, it is now possible to determine the occurrence of the mtp gene in various Mycobacterial species and study the levels of expression of the gene.\n\nIn this study, we sought to determine whether the MTP protein is a suitable biomarker for a potential diagnostic test for tuberculosis. Therefore, BLAST analysis on publically available genome databases and sequencing was performed to determine the presence and conservation of the mtp gene in MTBC strains, NTM and other respiratory organisms. In addition, we analysed the protein secondary structure and topology of the pilin subunits of these organisms. We showed that the mtp gene and its encoded protein product, MTP is unique to MTBC strains with only partial similarity to Mycobacterium marinum.\n\nMycobacteria and other respiratory organisms used in this study are listed in Table 1 . Mycobacterial isolates were cultured for 2e3 weeks at 37 C, on Middlebrook 7H11 complete agar (BD Difco) containing 10% oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, catalase (OADC) (Becton Dickinson and Company), except for Mycobacterium chelonae that was incubated at 30 C and Mycobacterium ulcerans at 32 C. Respiratory organisms were cultured at 37 C in the presence of 5% CO 2 for 48 h on blood agar, with the exceptions of Haemophilus spp. and Legionella pneumophila that were grown on chocolate agar and Buffered Charcoal Yeast Extract (BCYE) agar in moist conditions respectively.\n\nThe complete genome sequences of some Mycobacterial spp. and other respiratory organisms are available on the NCBI website [35] (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), the TB database [36] (www.tbdb. org), the Broad Institute website [37] (www.broad.mit.edu), the GenoList databases [38] (http://genolist.pasteur.fr) and the Sanger Institute website [39] (www.sanger.ac.uk). The degree of homology of the mtp gene and corresponding amino acid sequence to the MTBC was determined by BLAST analysis (blastn and blastp) and multi-sequence alignment (Bioedit). The mtp gene was presumed absent if no hits were obtained for organisms that have the complete genomes present on the database.\n\nPartial sequence alignment was found in M. marinum, Mycobacterim avium, M. ulcerans, and Mycobacterium abscessus. The function of the hypothetical proteins encoded by these gene sequences is unknown. The amino acid sequences of these partiallyaligned sequences were, therefore, analysed for the secondary structure, topology and antigenic epitopes to determine if these proteins resemble pilin protein subunits. This was done using PredictProtein software [40] and the Abie Pro: Peptide Antibody Design version 3.0 program [41] , and compared to that of M. tuberculosis. \n\nPurified DNA was prepared by the Sodium chlorideeCetyl trimethylammonium bromide method as previously described [42] , with the exception of the M. ulcerans DNA, obtained using the boiling method. The ability of the latter DNA to be amplified was tested using the 16S rRNA housekeeping gene (results not shown). Following optimisation experiments, the DNA concentrations of all MTBC, NTMs and respiratory microbes were quantitated using a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies). DNA samples were standardized to 10 ng/ml, that is, the maximum concentration required to give a PCR product if the mtp gene is present in the organism.\n\nThe complete mtp gene was amplified using the following primers: forward: \n\nThe PCR products were purified and then sequenced using the primer set described above by Inqaba Biotec, Pretoria, South Africa.\n\nThe chromatograms were analysed using Chromas Pro and multiple sequence alignment was performed with Bioedit software.\n\nTo determine the value of the mtp gene as a diagnostic marker, it was imperative to determine specificity to M. tuberculosis as compared to other members of the MTBC and NTM as well as other respiratory pathogens and commensals. The mtp gene and corresponding amino acid sequence were aligned against all relevant complete genome sequences available on the publically available databases.\n\nNucleotide Table 2 ). The lower the e-value, the stronger the homology with that of the mtp gene sequence of the organism. All the MTBC organisms displayed a lower e-value and thus showed 100% homology of the mtp gene. Higher e-values and therefore partial homologies were obtained for the NTM (Table 2) .\n\nBLAST analysis of the complete genomes of other respiratory organisms showed that no significant similarity was found for the following bacteria: Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Bordetella pertussis, Moraxella The complete genome sequence was not available for L. pneumophila but this isolate was cultured for amplicon sequencing (Table 1) .\n\nViruses and fungi are not likely to possess pilin protein. Nevertheless, the mtp gene sequence was aligned to the complete genome sequences of the following organisms: Rhinovirus, Coronavirus, Enterovirus, Adenovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, parainfluenza virus, Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis. However, no homology was observed.\n\nThe mtp gene (Rv3312A) was specifically and consistently amplified as a 582 bp size product from all the MTBC subspecies tested (Figure 2(A) ). These included the most prevalent strains in KwaZulu-Natal, a few other cluster strains, some unique strains, M. bovis, M. bovis BCG, M. africanum, M. microti and M. canettii. In contrast, none of the NTM strains showed a positive PCR result (Figure 2(B) ), despite extensive optimization (results not shown). The PCR on the NTMs was conducted with a standardised DNA concentration and the negative result was interpreted as the absence of the gene in the organism.\n\nNo mutations were observed in the mtp gene in 84/86 (97.7%) of M. tuberculosis clinical strains (Figure 3(A) ). Two isolates of M. tuberculosis harboured point mutations, a G54C synonymous and a G17T non-synonymous mutation with a C6F amino acid change (Figure 3(B) ).\n\nPartial sequence alignment was found in M. marinum, M. avium, M. ulcerans and M. abscessus. The function of the hypothetical proteins encoded by these gene sequences is unknown. The amino acid sequences of these partial sequences were therefore analysed for secondary structure and topology using the PredictProtein software. The predicted protein structure of the encoded gene sequences of M. avium, M. ulcerans and M. abscessus differed from that of the M. tuberculosis, which was 67% similar to M. marinum ( Figure 4 ).\n\nMTP protein coded for by the mtp gene contained a transmembrane region, one antigenic epitope, and comprised 19.42% a-helix, with 80.58% random coil. The amino acid sequence that had the highest sequence similarity (67%) and pairwise sequence identity (55%) to the MTP amino acid sequence was that of M. marinum. The protein of M. marinum contained a transmembrane region, but possessed 2 epitopes and a different secondary structure (27.66% a-helix and 72.34% random coil).\n\nM. abscessus amino acid sequence had a 44% pairwise sequence identity and 59% sequence similarity to the MTP amino acid sequence. Whilst the secondary structure was similar, the protein contained no transmembrane region. The M. avium amino acid sequence had a 43% pairwise sequence identity and 57% sequence similarity to the MTP amino acid sequence. However, the protein lacked a transmembrane region and contained 4 epitopes. The secondary structure comprised 6.3% strand structure and no a-helix. M. ulcerans amino acid sequence had the No hits * e-values represent the number of hits one can \"expect\" to see by chance when searching a database. The lower the e-value, or the closer it is to \"0\", the higher is the \"significance\" of the match. lowest similarity to the MTP amino acid sequence with 41% pairwise sequence identity and 53% sequence similarity. The protein contained no transmembrane region, 4 epitopes, and a highly looped secondary structure (Figure 4 ). It is therefore apparent that the proteins of M. abscessus, M. avium and M. ulcerans do not resemble the pilin subunit protein structure. The protein of M. marinum however, does resemble the pilin subunit protein of M. tuberculosis. \n\nThe role of MTP in adhesion of M. tuberculosis to the host was first reported in 2007 [23] . MTP were proposed to be the first point of contact with the host and unique to pathogenic Mycobacteria. MTP were recently viewed by Atomic Force Microscopy in XDR-TB and TDR-TB strains [43] . It has been conclusively proven that the mtp gene is required for pili formation in M. tuberculosis [23, 44] . In this study, BLAST analysis of the complete genome sequences of various Mycobacteria and other respiratory pathogens and commensals [35e 37, 39] , as well as amplicon sequencing has proven conclusively that the mtp gene is unique to members of the MTBC. The very low frequency of mutations in the mtp gene indicated that it is highly conserved among the clinical strains of M. tuberculosis. Furthermore, the partial homology detected in NTM has not been linked to proteins similar to those encoding pilin subunits, with the exception of M. marinum. This is the first study providing evidence that the mtp gene is highly conserved, suggestive of the potential use of its encoded product, the MTP protein, as a biomarker for MTBC pathogens.\n\nFurther support for this is provided by the bioinformatics analysis, suggesting that the partial protein homologies in other NTMs occurred by chance, with high e-values and very low sequence similarity. The predicted protein structure encoded by the gene sequences of M. avium, M. ulcerans, and M. abscessus differed from that of M. tuberculosis. The low pairwise sequence identity and the fact that these are not transmembrane proteins and differ in secondary structure decreases the probability that these proteins code for pilin subunits or are involved in pilin assembly. Also, the probability of cross reactivity with MTP in an antigen based diagnostic assay for MTBC is unlikely.\n\nIn contrast to these NTMs, the transmembrane protein of M. marinum has greater sequence identity and secondary structural similarity to M. tuberculosis. Whilst this does not necessarily dictate a similar function, pili proteins from groups of Gram-positive organisms have been shown to be clearly related. Ancillary protein1 (AP1), encoded by pilus islands 1 and 2 of group B Streptococci share 42% sequence identity with each other and 50% identity with AP1 of S. pneumoniae [45] . It is likely that this partially-aligned protein of M. marinum may be a pilus-like protein, similar to that of MTP but the presence of these cell-surface structures in this organism still needs to be confirmed experimentally. However, the secondary structural similarity of M. marinum is unlikely to pose an obstacle to MTBC diagnostics as this organism does not cause NTM lung disease. M. marinum has been isolated from subcutaneous lesions on the skin of humans and can only grow at very low temperatures [46, 47] .\n\nMTP are similar to curli pili produced by E. coli and Salmonella enterica in their morphology as well as their ability to bind to Congo Red and laminin [23] . However, they differ in their secondary structure, in that the MTP amino acid sequence consists of an ahelix, whereas, that of E. coli pilin is a b-barrel structure [22] . Curli pili in general are non-branching, b-sheet rich fibres that are resistant to protease digestion and 1% SDS [22] . In E. coli, curli pili are assembled via the nucleation precipitation pathway [32] . Little is known about the structure and assembly of MTP [23] . The mtp gene does not belong to an operon like the pili biogenesis genes of bacteria such as E. coli, Salmonella spp. and Gram-positive bacteria [48e51] . The mtp gene is located in between genes involved in intermediary metabolism (add, deoA and cdd) as well as Rv3312c, a gene of unknown function [23, 38, 44] .\n\nNovel TB biomarkers are urgently needed as targets for the development of rapid point of care diagnostics as well as therapeutic interventions and vaccines. Previous studies identified an arsenal of novel M. tuberculosis antigens including 38-kDa antigen, 19-kDa lipoprotein, 16-kDa antigen, MTB81, ESAT-6, antigen 85B, MPT51, MPT32, 14-kDa antigen, A60, HBHA, PE and PPE antigens and the glycolipid antigens for use in serodiagnostic assays as reviewed by Abebe et al., 2007 [52] . The low and variable sensitivity of these assays based on the inclusion of a single biomarker led to the proposal of various combinations of these immunodominant antigens for the detection of different stages of TB infection or disease [53] . However, serodiagnostic tests aimed at measuring antibody levels in biological samples have proved unsuccessful [54e58] . Commercial point of care diagnostic tests that measure the presence of M. tuberculosis antigens such as MPT64 [9\u00c013], ESAT-6/CFP-10 [7, 8, 21, 59, 60] and Antigen 85 [61] are limited as they are based on culture. The MPT64 antibodies showed a limited sensitivity of 64.4% when tested on sputum specimens in a sandwich Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis [62] . LAM antigens, either alone or with other epitopes have shown limited accuracy on clinical specimens [18, 20, 63] . Other epitopes that have been evaluated for diagnostic purposes include the IP-10 [64] , B cell antigens [65] , malate synthase and MPT51 [66e68].\n\nA limitation of most biomarker studies is the lack of extensive evaluation of an epitope prior to screening of biological samples. In addition to providing evidence of the conserved nature and specificity of the mtp gene to the MTBC in this study, we have detected the mtp gene transcript in broth and agar grown clinical MTBC strains in preliminary experiments using RT-PCR. Further studies are in progress to verify these results and to detect the presence of MTP in these strains. Furthermore, gene knockout and complementation studies have proved the essentiality of the mtp gene for MTP production [23, 44] . We therefore propose MTP as a relevant diagnostic marker for the MTBC. Studies are underway to screen for anti-pili antibodies in patients with various stages of tuberculosis and to generate monoclonal antibodies for the detection of MTP antigen in clinical specimens of patients with tuberculosis."}
