{"title": "Sequence analysis of the S gene of recombinant MHV-2/A59 coronaviruses reveals three candidate mutations associated with demyelination and hepatitis", "body": "Mouse hepatitis Virus (MHV) is a member of the coronavirus family of the nidovirales order (Cavanagh, 1997; Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . Nidoviruses produce a variety of hepatic, enteric, and neurologic diseases in animals, and upper respiratory and enteric diseases in humans (Lavi and Weiss, 1989; Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Lavi et al, 1999) . Infection of MHV-A59 in 4-week-old C57Bl/6 (B6) mice produces a biphasic disease with acute hepatitis and meningoencephalitis followed by chronic in ammatory de-myelinating disease (Lavi et al, 1984; Lavi et al, 1986) . It serves as an excellent laboratory model of virusinduced demyelination, which mimics many of the clinical and pathologic features of multiple sclerosis (MS) (Weiner, 1973; Knobler et al, 1981; Wege et al, 1982; Lavi et al, 1984; Perlman et al, 1990; Houtman and Fleming, 1996) .\n\nWe have recently studied the pathogenesis and complete sequence analysis of the MHV-2 genome, a closely related strain to MHV-A59 (Das . Previous studies suggested that MHV-2 is only weakly neurotropic (Hirano et al, 1974; Hirano et al, 1981; Wege et al, 1981; Yokomori et al, 1991; Yamada et al, 1997) . We found that MHV-2 produces severe hepatitis and meningitis, without encephalitis or demyelination and without persistence of virus in the CNS (Das Sarma et al, 2000; Das Sarma et al, 2001) . Using targeted recombination, we replaced the S gene of MHV-A59 with that of MHV-2, and produced recombinant viruses (Penn98-1 and Penn98-2) that have a persistence-positive, demyelination-negative phenotype (Das Sarma et al, 2000) . We concluded that demyelination determinants, independent of viral persistence, map to the S gene of MHV.\n\nTo further explore which parts of the S gene are directly responsible for the demyelinating phenotype, we sought to analyze the S gene of viruses that are closely related to MHV-A59, but are unable to produce demyelination. Thus, we used recombinant viruses (ML-7, ML-8, ML-10, and ML-11) that were previously produced by co-infection of cultures with MHV-2 and a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant of MHV-A59 (LA-7) (Keck et al, 1988) (Figure 1 ). These recombinant viruses were found to be demyelinationnegative in preliminary studies.\n\nWe rst ascertained that the recombinant viruses were able to replicate well in tissue culture. Infection of L2 cells revealed that all recombinant viruses reached titers of approximately 2 \u00a3 10 7 PFU/ml in 24 h. The viruses ML-7, ML-8, and ML-10 produced large plaques and syncytia formation in over 80% of the cultured L2 cells at the peak of lytic infection (similar to MHV-A59). ML-11 produced small plaques and only small syncytia of no more than 3-5 nuclei in less than 5% of the cells during lytic infection (similar to MHV-2).\n\nWe then tested the pathogenic properties and histopathology of the recombinant viruses in mice. The virulence of each one of the MHVs in mice was determined by the dose that killed 50% of the mice (LD 50 ) (Reed and Muench, 1938) . As previously described, the LD 50 of MHV-A59 is 4000 PFU, and that of MHV-2 is 200 PFU. The LD 50 of ML-11 was 4000 PFU and the LD 50 of ML-7, ML-8, ML-10, and LA-7 was nonlethal (>50,000 PFU). To further assess the kinetics of viral infection in mice, 4-week-old, virusfree, B6 mice were inoculated into the left hemisphere with 1000 PFU (25 \u00b9l volume) of each virus. At intervals of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 30 days p.i., 2-4 mice per time point were sacri ced, and perfused with 10 ml PBS, followed by 10 ml 10% buffered for- Table 1 Pathogenesis of recombinant viruses as compared to MHV-A59 and MHV-2\n\nmalin. Organs such as the thymus, liver, brain, and spinal cord were removed and xed in formalin for additional 48 h. Tissues were embedded in paraf n, sectioned at 5 \u00b9m thickness and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Brain and spinal cord sections were also stained with Luxol Fast Blue (LFB) for detection of myelin. Each brain was serially sectioned into 5-7 coronal sections. The 5-7 cross-sections were prepared, representing cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions of the spinal cord. To better demonstrate primary demyelination (loss of myelin sheaths surrounding intact neuronal axons), some mice were perfused with 2% glutaraldehyde; spinal cord sections were embedded in Epon and stained with toluidine blue (Lavi et al, 1984) . Table 1 summarizes the pathologic ndings in mice infected with the different viruses. Following IC injection of 4-week-old B/6 mice, 1000 PFU of MHV-A59 produced moderate acute hepatitis and acute meningo-encephalitis in 14/14 mice, followed by chronic CNS demyelinating disease in 16/16 mice as previously described (Lavi et al, 1988; Lavi et al, 1990) . Infection (IC) of 4-week-old B/6 mice with 1000 PFU of MHV-2 produced severe hepatitis, and meningitis in 14/14 surviving mice without encephalitis as previously described . Because the LD 50 of MHV-2 is much lower than MHV-A59, we also infected mice with lower doses of MHV-2. Infection of mice with 100 PFU and 200 PFU of MHV-2 produced the same results as 1000 PFU. There was also no demyelination in 0/16 mice infected with 100, 200, and 1000 PFU of MHV-2. Recombinant ML-11 produced acute encephalitis and hepatitis in 7/7 mice, similar to MHV-A59, following IC injection with 1000 PFU. The same dose (1000 PFU) of ML-7, ML-8, and ML-10 produced mild acute encephalitis (in 4/4 mice with each virus), but did not produce hepatitis (in 0/4 mice with each virus). Higher doses of ML-7, ML-8, and ML-10 (up to 2.5 \u00a3 10 5 PFU per mouse) remained nonlethal and produced similar pathologic changes. Viral titers in the brains of mice showed that ML-11 had similar or higher titers than MHV-A59, whereas MHV-2 had lower titers, attributed to the meningitis. ML-10 had low titers (Figure 2 ). Thymic cortical depletion was observed in MHV-A59, MHV-2, and ML-11 infections. Infection of mice with LA-7 (one of the parental viruses used for the recombination process) did not produce any pathology including no demyelination. This phenotype is probably because LA-7 is a temperature-sensitive mutant that does not grow very well in mice. The recombinant viruses produced from LA-7 corrected the ts defect and are no longer temperature-sensitive.\n\nMultiple sections of spinal cord from mice infected with the various recombinant viruses were examined for myelin loss and in ammatory lesions at 30 days p.i. MHV-A59 caused chronic spinal cord demyelination that was detected in 16/16 mice by H&E-, LFB-, or toluidine-blue-stained sections. However, mice infected with MHV-2 (0/14), ML-7 (0/3), ML-8 (0/3), ML-10 (0/3), or ML-11 (0/6) did not exhibit chronic demyelination in any of the spinal cord or brain sections stained with H&E and LFB. Toluidine blue staining of Epon-embedded sections revealed numerous demyelinated axons in MHV-A59-infected mice (Figure 3 ), but no demyelination was seen in mice infected with MHV-2 or with the recombinant viruses, with the exception of ML-11. In mice infected with ML-11, rare demyelinated axons in multiple spinal cord sections were detected in one of the mice (Figure 3) . Demyelination was not observed in mice infected with the attenuated viruses (ML-7, ML-8, and ML-10) at doses as high as 2.5 \u00a3 10 5 PFU.\n\nFor sequencing of the viral genomes, we used reverse-transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) ampli cation of cytoplasmic RNA extracted from virus-infected L2 cells (m.o.i. D 1), harvested 16 h p.i. Complementary DNA was synthesized using oligonucleotide primers. Primers were designed to amplify fragments of approximately 600 base pairs (Leparc-Goffart et al, 1997; Das Sarma et al, 2000) . The sequencing data was submitted to GenBank (accession numbers AF208067 and AF207902). Sequencing of the S gene of ML-7, ML-8, and ML-10 revealed 3 amino acid substitutions I375M, L652I, and T1087N as compared to MHV-A59 (Figure 1 ). Because these viruses were derived from a recombination between a ts mutant of A59 (LA7) and MHV-2 (Keck et al, 1988) , we se- quenced the S gene of LA7. We found that LA-7 contained the exact same mutations as the recombinant viruses ML-7, ML-8, and ML-10, indicating that these mutations were all derived from LA7. The amino acid sequence of the S gene of ML-11 was identical to that of MHV-2 (GenBank accession number AF201929). Thus, demyelination-negative viruses had S genes that belonged to one of two types. These viruses either had an S gene derived from MHV-2, or an S gene derived from A59 but contained the 3 mutations that were acquired from their parental virus LA-7. The hepatitis-negative phenotype also mapped to one or more of the S gene mutations. It has recently been found that determinants of hepatitis also map to the S gene of MHV (Navas et al, 2001) . Although it is possible that only one of these mutations is relevant to the biologic property of demyelination or hepatitis, two or even all three of these mutations may be necessary to produce these biologic properties. Studies are underway to determine the relative contribution of each one of these mutations to the demyelinationnegative and/or hepatitis-negative phenotype. The site of these mutations within the S gene involves various parts of the S gene. The I375M mutation is downstream from the receptor-binding site, the L652I mutation is within the variable region of the S gene and the T1087N mutation is in the region between the two heptad repeats. The speci c functions of all of these regions are still unknown. Mutations, in the heptad repeat region at positions 1067 (Q to H), 1094 (Q to H), and 1114 (L to R), have been shown to affect pHdependent fusion properties (Gallagher et al, 1991) .\n\nAll recombinant viruses produced various degrees of encephalitis but none of them was capable of producing demyelination. This nding suggests that the mutations found in the S gene are not associated with encephalitis, or neurotropism as a general phenomenon, but speci cally with demyelination and hepatitis. Because the amount of virus during acute infection was either higher than MHV-A59 (ML-11) or lower than MHV-A59 (ML-10), the level of virus during acute infection is probably not a signi cant determinant of demyelination. Additional support for this theory comes from studies in which CD28 knockout mice were infected with MHV-A59. The transgenic mutation lowered the level of viral titers during acute infection but did not change the level of demyelination (Das Sarma et al, in preparation) . It is also clear that whereas demyelination probably depends on various sites in the viral genome, the S gene probably contains the most important determinants of demyelination. Random mutations produced in various parts of the genome are unable to abrogate demyelination (data not shown). The abrogation of the property of demyelination only occurs when speci c sites are mutated. So far, only mutations within the S gene have been associated with abrogation of of demyelination. Moreover, although acute encephalitis may be a prerequisite for chronic demyelination, the presence of acute encephalitis is not suf cient to induce chronic demyelination. The property of demyelination probably requires additional factor(s) beyond the mere ability of the virus to invade and infect the CNS. These factors may be related to the interaction between the virus and the immune system or may be associated with the ability of the virus to induce certain host responses such as cytokine release or apoptosis. Current studies in our laboratory focus on the factors necessary for encephalitic viruses to be able to produce chronic demyelination.\n\nPrevious studies using monoclonal antibodies to modify pathogenic properties, and phenotypesequence correlation of mutant and variant viruses, linked determinants of pathogenesis to the S, M, and HE proteins (Collins et al, 1982; Knobler et al, 1982; Buchmeier et al, 1984; Dalziel et al, 1986; Fleming et al, 1989; Lavi et al, 1990; Laude et al, 1992; Hingley et al, 1994; Leparc-Goffart et al, 1997) . However, the recently adopted targeted recombination for pathogenesis studies of MHV provides more direct and reliable information about molecular determinants of pathogenesis (Lavi et al, 1998a; Lavi et al, 1998b; Leparc-Goffart et al, 1998; Phillips et al, 1999; Das Sarma et al, 2000) .\n\nIn conclusion, we describe the sequence analysis of the S gene of several non-demyelinating MHVs. Sequence analysis identi es three S gene mutations that are common to 3 demyelination-negative viruses with an S gene derived from MHV-A59. Therefore, these mutations can be potential candidate sites for direct targeted recombination analysis used to study the mechanism of MHV-induced demyelination. The formation of a virus with an A59 S gene on an MHV-2 background would also be extremely helpful. Sitedirected mutagenesis studies in the S gene are underway in our laboratory.\n\nThis work was supported in part by a National Multiple Sclerosis Society grant RG-2615-B-2 and PHS grants NS30606 and NS18146.
