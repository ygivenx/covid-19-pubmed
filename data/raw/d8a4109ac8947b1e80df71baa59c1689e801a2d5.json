{"title": "Structural lability in stem-loop 1 drives a 5' UTR-3' UTR interaction in coronavirus replication", "body": "Coronaviruses comprise a large group of enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense mRNA viruses classified in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales. 1 Coronaviruses infect many different vertebrate hosts and induce a broad spectrum of diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 2,3 Coronaviruses (CoV) have been classified into three subgroups based on serologic relatedness, genetic organization, and sequence similarity. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is the most extensively studied coronavirus, is genetically tractable, and provides small animal models for several diseases including SARS, 4 a disease caused by the related group 2 SARS-coronavirus.\n\nLike other coronaviruses, MHV has a large \u224832 kb positive sense viral RNA genome flanked by 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). The 5' two-thirds of the genome encodes the replicase complex (ORF 1) whose expression requires a -1 1a/1b translational frameshift, 5 with downstream ORFs encoding a variety of structural and accessory proteins required for replication and assembly of infectious virus. 1,6 MHV transcription generates a set of nested subgenomic mRNAs, which contain 5'-and 3'-regions that are identical to those of the genomic RNA. [7] [8] [9] The most widely accepted model to explain this unique discontinuous transcription mechanism posits that subgenomic negative strand RNAs are synthesized from genome-sized template, and that the subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized from subgenomic minus-strands. [10] [11] [12] have refined this model by providing strong support for the hypothesis that heptameric core intergenic sequences or \"body\" transcription regulatory sequences (TRS-Bs) signal template switching to the TRS is the 5' leader (TRS-L), as well as suggest the existence of RNA-RNA interactions between the 5' and 3' UTRs, and proteins bound to these UTRs. 13\n\nMany cis-acting sequences in the 5' UTR have been shown to play an important role in RNA transcription and replication; 14-18 however, insights into the secondary structure of the 5'UTR were until recently limited. We have developed a consensus secondary structure model based on the sequences of nine coronaviruses, in which the 5' leader RNA, consisting of the 5' most 72 nucleotides of the 5' UTR in MHV, is characterized by two conserved stem-loop structures, denoted SL1 and SL2. 19, 20 We have shown that SARS-CoV SL1 and SL2 can replace their MHV counterparts in an otherwise MHV genomic RNA; these chimeric viruses are transcriptionally active and replication competent. 19 This experiment strongly supports the predicted secondary structural architecture of the 5' UTR in MHV. SL2 is a highly conserved pentaloop containing structural features consistent with a U-turn architecture that plays a critical role in subgenomic RNA synthesis, as well as in translation . 20 In this report, we extensively characterize the functional and structural properties of SL1. We show that SL1 adopts a bipartite structure with the functional boundary two consecutive pyrimidine-pyrimidine (pyr-pyr) base pairs in the middle of the SL1 helix. 20 The upper region of the stem must be base paired to support viral replication to near wild-type levels. In striking contrast, characterization of mutant viruses in which an unpaired nucleotide, A35, is deleted, leads to the recovery of a diverse collection of mutant viruses that contain single-nucleotide second site mutations in the lower half of SL1, all of which are kinetically and thermodynamically destabilizing. In addition, these viruses contain one of two single nucleotide substitutions in the extreme 3' UTR of the genome. Nonviable mutants in this region of SL1, like SL2 mutants characterized previously, 20 fail to support sgRNA synthesis. These data taken collectively suggest that the base of SL1 must adopt an optimized stability or kinetic lability to mediate a long-range interaction between the 5' and 3' UTRs that is an obligate step in the transcription of sgRNAs. The nature of this interaction is discussed.\n\nA series of NMR studies of SL1-containing RNA constructs from both HCoV-OC43 and MHV document the key predicted structural features of SL1 in our model, 20 the most notable of which is two consecutive pyr-pyr base pairs, U12\u2022C32 and U13\u2022U31 in the middle of the helix, flanked on either side by Watson-Crick A11-U33 and G14-C30 base pairs (Figure 1(a) ). In addition, these NMR studies also suggested that either A35 or A36 is an unpaired extrahelical nucleotide and that the alternative pairing of U9 with A35 or A36 introduces a local destabilization in this region of SL1 stem. 20 Interestingly, the predicted SL1s in other coronaviral genomes also appear to conserve this general features of a rather weakly paired region at the base or middle of SL1, containing either or both non-canonical base pairs and extrahelical nucleotides, suggesting that this might be important for replication of MHV and perhaps other coronaviruses. This served as the motivation for the construction of a mutant MHV genome harboring a single nucleotide deletion of A35 (SL1-\u0394A35). \u00a7\n\nSince NMR data supported the existence of SL1 in 5' leader-containing RNA fragments, 20 we first investigated the functional importance of SL1 in viral replication. One set of mutations targeted the upper portion of SL1 above the pyr-pyr base pairs, while a second set targeted the lower region of SL1 (Table 1) . Plaque size phenotypes (Table 1 , Supplementary Figure S1 ) and one-step growth curves (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S2) were measured for all viable viruses. Deletion of each of the three cytidines unique to MHV (C16, C19 and C20, with C16 predicted to be extrahelical) either singly or all three together gave rise to viable viruses with WT-like growth characteristics (Supplementary Figure S2 (a) ). Thus, the C residues are dispensable for viral replication justifying our use of the wild-type model (denoted WT*) in physical studies presented below (see Figure 1 (b), Figure 5 , Figure 6 (a), and Figure 7 ). Deletion of these cytidines results in three consecutive G-C base pairs in the upper segment of the stemloop (Figure 1(b) ).\n\nMutations that disrupt the three consecutive G-C base pairs in the WT genome were either nonviable (SL1-A) or resulted in a virus with a moderately smaller plaque size (SL1-B). Computer assisted modeling with Mfold and ViennaRNA (see ref. 19 ) indicate that the SL1-B mutant is may adapt an alternative stable folding that largely maintains the SL1 structure, whereas the SL1-A mutant does not (data not shown). In contrast, the compensatory mutant, SL1-AB, containing both the SL1-A and SL1-B mutations and predicted to restore base pairing, possessed a similar plaque size and had almost identical growth kinetics as the WT virus (Table 1, Figure 2 (a) and Supplementary Figure S1 ). These data reveal that the upper portion of SL1 must be base paired in order to support efficient virus replication.\n\nIn contrast, the mutations introduced below the two consecutive pyr-pyr base pairs gave rise to completely opposite results. Two viral genomes carrying mutations that destroy base pairing in this region (SL1-C and SL1-D) were found to be viable, albeit with significantly smaller plaque sizes and slower one-step growth curves than the wild type virus (Table1, Figure 2 (a) and Supplementary Figure S1) . Surprisingly, the corresponding double transversion mutant predicted to restore base pairing here (SL-CD) was not viable (Table 1) .\n\nTo further investigate the functional importance of the lower SL1 region, we characterized mutant viruses containing a deletion of A35 (SL1-\u0394A35). From two completely independent transfections we recovered 12 plaque purified viruses. Sequencing of the complete 5' and 3' UTRs of the 12 plaque-purified viruses revealed only two of these viruses contained the SL1-\u0394A35 sequence; the remaining ten viruses made up a diverse collection of single-nucleotide second-site substitutions in the immediate vicinity of the deleted nucleotide. Several of these plaque isolates contained identical sequences in their 5' and 3'UTRs. Viruses with identical sequences had similar plaque sizes. The plaque phenotypes of one example of each second site mutation are presented in Table 1 . These mutations include C37U, A36U, C34U and U33C (from the base of SL1 toward the hairpin loop; see Figure 1 (c)) in the context of the parent SL1-\u0394A35 deletion. Additionally, viruses containing the SL1-\u0394A35 sequence were completely replaced by viruses containing a second site mutation (G10A) in SL1 after only one passage in DBT cells, confirming that viruses containing only a deletion of A35 were genetically \u00a7 Although A35 or A36 (or both, one at a time) could theoretically be extruded from the SL1 helix, extrusion of either one gives rise to the same structure of paired bases in the SL1 stem. In this work, we characterized SL1-\u0394A35 MHV mutants, but SL1-\u0394A36 viruses would give rise to exactly the same sequence in SL1 and thus would not be functionally distinguishable from the SL1-\u0394A35 virus. unstable and were subjected to strong negative selection. Remarkably, although diverse in sequence, all second site mutants possess a common property: each is predicted to change a Watson-Crick base pair in the wild-type SL1 to a non-canonical base pair (vide infra).\n\nIn addition to these substitutions in the 5'-UTR, all recovered viruses contained one of two second-site single nucleotide substitutions in the 3' UTR, 3'-A29G or 3'-A78G (3', counting from the 3' nucleotide of the 3' UTR in the genomic strand, before the poly(A) tail), near the very 3' end of the genome some \u224830 kb distant. In one case (SL1-\u0394A35/C34U) the passage 1 virus contained a mixture of the 3'-A78G and wild type sequences. The wild type sequence was lost after one additional passage (Figure 4(a) ). Both A29G and A78G mutations in the 3' UTR share the same sequence context, GAGG, relative to the same wild-type context GAAG. In addition, since in at least one case, C37U, both A29G and A78G substitutions were recovered; this is consistent with the idea that each mutation, which co-evolves with the 5' UTR mutation, is functionally equivalent. These data argue for a physical interaction between 5' UTR and 3' UTRs in MHV and suggest that is mediated by a \"destabilized\" or \"dynamic\" SL1.\n\nTo confirm that the phenotypes of the second site suppressor viruses that arose after electroporation with the SL1-\u0394A35 mutant genome were due to the second site mutations we detected in the 5' and 3'UTRs, and not other mutations in regions of the genome were not sequenced, we examined two mutants, SL1-\u0394A35/C37U/3'A29G and SL1-\u0394A35/C37U/ 3'A78G, in more detail. We constructed genomes containing these mutations using our standard reverse genetic system, and generated recombinant viruses (designated rSL1-\u0394A35/ C37U/3'A29G and rSL1-\u0394A35/C37U/3'A78G). The sequence of the 5' and 3'UTRs of these viruses were verified and their plaque morphologies and growth phenotypes were compared with the corresponding SL1-\u0394A35 second site supressor mutants. Each of the six plaque isolates of the recombinant mutant viruses rSL1-\u0394A35/C37U/3'A29G and rSL1-\u0394A35/C37U/ 3'A78G contained no additional mutations in their 5' and 3' UTRs, and their plaque sizes and morphologies are very similar to those of the originally recovered mutants SL1-\u0394A35/C37U/ 3'A29G and SL1-\u0394A35/C37U/3'A78G ( Fig. 3A and Supplementary Figure S3 ). These data strongly suggest the phenotypes of the originally recovered SL1-\u0394A35 second site revertants, are indeed due to the mutations in their 5' and 3' UTRs, rather than other uncharacterized mutations elsewhere in the genome.\n\nGenomes containing A-U to G-C base pair substitutions that are predicted to stabilize the lower region of SL1 are either nonviable (SL1-A5G/U40C) or unstable (SL1-A7G/U38C). In the case of SL1-A5G/U40C, single and double nucleotide substitutions that destroy the original base pair (SL1-A5G, SL1-U40C, or SL1-A5C/U40C) are all viable and characterized by near wild type-like plaque sizes and growth curve characteristics (Supplementary Figure S1-S2(b), Table 1 ). Strikingly, the SL1-A7G/U38C virus is a true revertant, with the A7G substitution repaired in the first passage, and the U38C substitution repaired next to generate the original A7-U38 base pair (Figure 4(b) ). These data taken collectively suggest that the lower portion of SL1 is weakly base paired or not at all (vide infra), and that this region of the stem plays a critical role in viral replication.\n\nTo determine whether the altered growth phenotypes of MHV SL1 mutant viruses correlated with defects in genome replication or sgRNA synthesis, virus-specific RNAs were metabolically radiolabeled and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Cells infected with MHV SL1 mutant viruses synthesized both genomic (gRNA) and the seven subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) in approximately the same ratios as observed for a wild-type virus infection (Supplementary Figure S4 ). SL1-B, SL1-C, SL1-D, SL1-\u0394C16/19/20 and SL1-\u0394A35/C34U/3'A78G viruses appeared to synthesize the lowest absolute quantities of genomic and sgRNAs (<32% of wild type), while the other SL1 mutant viruses directed the synthesis of virus-specific RNAs to levels greater than 55% of those observed with wild type virus. One nonviable mutant, SL1-A, was also assayed for the ability to synthesize subgenomic RNA (sgRNA 7) and genomic RNAs by a series of RT-PCR assays of RNA extracted from electroporated cells. Previous characterization of non-viable SL2 mutants revealed that the primary defect in these genomes was that they failed to support the transcription of sgRNAs, whereas replication of genome RNA was intact, 20 the latter evidenced by a \"\u2212\" sense gRNA replication intermediate. The same is true of the SL1-A mutant ( Figure 5) . A comparison of the in vitro translation efficiency of fusions of wild type and several SL1 mutant 5'UTRs that gave rise to non-viable genomes to luciferase reporters found no effect on translational efficiency (data not shown).\n\nThe functional data presented above are consistent with what we term a \"dynamic SL1\" hypothesis, which posits that the lower region of SL1 must be thermodynamically destabilized and/or dynamically (kinetically) labile in a way that is dependent only on the general physical features of this region of the SL1, rather than the precise nucleotide sequence, in order to fully support virus replication. In order to test this hypothesis and gain additional insight into SL1 structure, we synthesized three representative second-site SL1 revertant mutant RNAs (see Figure 1 (c)) and measured their thermodynamic stabilities using quantitative opticallymonitored thermal denaturation methods ( Optical melting profiles (dA/dT) are shown for the WT*, \u0394A35, \u0394A35/U33C, \u0394A35/C34U, \u0394A35/A36U SL1 RNAs in Figure 6 with the thermodynamic parameters described from a quantitative analysis of these melts compiled in Table 2 . In contrast to all of the other RNAs, the optical melting profile of the \u0394A35 SL1 RNA is well-modeled by a single two-state unfolding transition with a t m of 80.3 \u00b0C with an van't Hoff enthalpy of unfolding (\u0394H vH ) of 118 kcal mol \u22121 (Table 1) . Thermodynamic parameters derived from melting curves acquired using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) are in excellent agreement with the optical melts, as well as the expected \u0394H estimated from the nearest neighbor model. 21 In contrast, melting profiles obtained for the WT* RNA as well as the three \u0394A35 second site revertant mutant RNAs are broader than that obtained for the \u0394A35 RNA; they also unfold at significantly lower t m . A broadened unfolding transition is consistent with a superposition of two sequential twostate unfolding transitions, e.g., the lower and upper regions of the SL1 stem, or extreme nontwo state unfolding behavior of the SL1 stem in a single transition. In both cases, fitting of these melting profiles to a single two-state transition would result in insufficient van't Hoff enthalpy of unfolding (\u0394H vH ) to account for the unfolding of the entire 14-base pair stem ( Figure 6 ). This is exactly what we observe, with the apparent \u0394H vH of \u224870-75 kcal mol \u22121 in each case (fits not shown). Invoking a sequential two-state unfolding transition model reveals two unfolding steps with different amplitudes. If we assign the first unfolding step to the denaturation of the lower four base pairs in SL1 (predicted \u0394H vH =38 kcal mol \u22121 ; t m =61 \u00b0C) 22 then we recover sufficient \u0394H vH in the second (major) transition (70-86 kcal mol \u22121 ) to account for unfolding of the entire molecule. From these fits we calculate that the wild-type RNA is destabilized by 3.0 kcal mol \u22121 relative the \u0394A35 mutant, while the three second site revertants are destabilized by 2.1 (\u0394A35/U33C), 4.5 (\u0394A35/C34U) and 4.7 (\u0394A35/A36U) kcal mol \u22121 . These data reveal that the each of the recovered revertant RNAs share a common physical property with the wild-type RNA, i.e., all are thermodynamically destabilized relative to \u0394A35 mutant.\n\nSince thermodynamic destabilization is a global property of a molecule, we used NMR spectroscopy in an effort to localize changes in the structure and/or dynamics that could account for this. 1D imino proton spectra (10 \u00b0C, pH 6.0) for all five RNAs are shown in Figure 7 . What is immediately apparent for these RNAs is that the anticipated noncanonical base pairings, i.e., G10\u2022U34 in the \u0394A35/C34U RNA (Fig. 6(d) ) and U9\u2022U36 in \u0394A35/A36U (Fig.  6 (e)) are present since the imino protons of U34 and U36 are strongly protected from exchange with solvent in each case. 23-25 Although we did not directly determine whether the A33U substitution resulted in a new A\u2022C base pair, this is expected since this substitution would give rise to exactly the same three noncanonical pairings that characterize SL1 of a related group 2 CoV HCoV-OC43; in that RNA, a protonated A+\u2022C base pair is formed. 20 In addition, the finding that this RNA is the least destabilized relative to the \u0394A35 mutant is not compatible with the presence of extrahelical nucleotides in each of these positions. Thus, all three revertant RNAs are characterized by multiple noncanonical pairings in an otherwise perfectly basepaired helical stem.\n\nInspection of these spectra (Figure 7 ) as well as a compilation of the imino proton solvent exchange rates (Figure 8 ) reveals that thermodynamic destabilization manifests itself in multiple complex ways. First, the WT RNA imino proton spectrum reveals a superposition of at least two conformations in slow exchange on the 1 H NMR timescale as evidenced by peak doubling of the U40, G6 and U38 imino resonances at the base of the stem. Exactly the same type of heterogeneity is observed in the \u0394A35/U33C and \u0394A35/C34U RNAs but to a far greater degree, with the \u0394A35/A36U RNA more like the WT* RNA in this regard. All heterogeneity is lost in the \u0394A35 parent RNA.\n\nThe imino proton solvent exchange rates, k ex , reveal additional insight into SL1 dynamics. Although k ex is a complex function of the rate constants for the opening (k op ) and closing (k cl ) of the base pair (where the two-state equilibrium constant for base pair opening, K op , is defined by k op /k cl ) as well as the intrinsic rate constant for proton exchange by base catalyst (k tr ), the magnitude of k ex often tracks with the magnitude of k op and K op , 26-28 since exchange will occur only very slowly from the base paired state. 29,30 These data reveal that the WT* RNA is dynamically asymmetric, with imino protons above the U13-U31 base pair characterized by slow k ex (\u22642 s \u22121 ), while those below this base pair are \u22482-50-fold faster. For the \u0394A35 RNA, imino proton solvent exchange rates are globally quenched, but most strongly near the site of the deletion. For example, the k ex values of U9, G10 and U31 are strongly attenuated in the \u0394A35 RNA, by \u224810-, \u224832-, and \u22485-fold, respectively. Inspection of the base pair dynamics for the three mutant SL1 RNAs reveals that each re-introduces or accentuates one or more specific features of the kinetic lability that characterizes the WT* RNA. For example, in all three RNAs, the imino proton solvent exchange rates of the U13\u2022U31 base pair are elevated relative to the \u0394A35 RNA, by 4-10-fold, some more so than in the WT* RNA. This perturbation is local in the \u0394A35/U33C RNA, but next-nearest neighbor and long-range in the \u0394A35/C34U and \u0394A35/A36U RNAs, respectively. The solvent exchange rate of G10 is also increased in all RNAs, most prominently in the \u0394A35/C34U RNA in the context of the new G10\u2022U34 base pairing, but also in the other two revertant RNAs (by 3-4 fold). These data argue that the base of SL1 through the pyrimidine base pairing region in both the WT* and second site mutant SL1s recovered from the genetically unstable SL1-\u0394A35 virus must be conformationally heterogeneous and dynamically unstable; this, in turn, allows this region to become transiently unfolded so that a long-range interaction with the 3' UTR in MHV can occur.\n\nThe molecular mechanisms by which coronaviruses carry out subgenomic RNA synthesis and ultimately coordinate this process with replication of the genomic RNA and translation of the genome remains poorly understood. An early event in these processes, however, may well be genome circularization which places the 5' and 3' termini of the viral genome in close physical proximity to facilitate template switching during sgRNA minus strand synthesis. Template switching is simply hybridization of the nascently synthesized minus strand corresponding to the intergenic or body TRS sequences with the complementary leader TRS, a process expected to be strongly stimulated by the close physical proximity of the two complementary sequences. This process is almost certainly regulated by highly specific RNA structural motifs found in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) and associated interactions with virally encoded and/ or host proteins. The 5' leader RNA appended to all sgRNAs corresponds to the extreme 5' end of the 5' UTR and is composed of two stem-loop structures termed SL1 and SL2 just upstream of the transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) that defines the leader-body junction. 19 Characterization of non-viable viruses that harbor mutations in SL1 (this work) or SL2 20 reveals that these genomes are generally wild-type with respect to synthesis of full-length genomic and anti-genomic RNAs; however, all are absolutely impaired in sgRNA synthesis.\n\nA recent model for coronavirus replication 13 postulated that circularization of the genome is a necessary early step in sgRNA synthesis. However, there is little direct evidence for or against a physical association of the 5' and 3' ends of the genome that might be required for sgRNA synthesis, as well as the nature of that interaction (RNA-, protein-mediated or both), although it has been proposed that circularization stabilized by a protein bridge composed of cap-binding protein, eIF4E, eIF4G and poly(A) binding protein 31 might be important for initiation of the replicase gene translation. 32 During the course of testing the functional impact of mutations deposited in the MHV SL1, we have uncovered two critical aspects of SL1 that are required for sgRNA synthesis. Here, we present the first genetic evidence in support of a direct interaction between SL1 and the extreme 3' end of the genome; furthermore, the physical analysis of RNAs harboring second site revertants in SL1 recovered from the genetically unstable SL1-\u0394A35 viruses, allows us to pinpoint clear structural requirements for the lower region of SL1 (below the pyr-pyr base pairs mapped by NMR spectroscopy) that are essential for supporting viral replication.\n\nOur functional data indicate that the base paring of the upper portion of the stem is required for optimal viral replication, while the lower portion is weakly base paired or even unpaired. Genomes containing A5G/U40C or A7G/U38C mutations that stabilize the extreme lower portion of the stem could not be recovered as viable viruses. While deletion of A35 is still viable, this virus is genetically unstable, and gives rise to second site mutations in both the 5' and 3'UTRs. Interestingly, all the second site mutations in the 5'UTR are located below the pyr-pyr base pairs, and introduce noncanonical base pairs to maintain stem formation. Each of these mutants SL1 stem structures are less thermodynamically stable compared with the genetically unstable SL1-\u0394A35 mutant which forms a fully base-paired helical stem. These mutations also introduce conformational heterogeneity in this region as well. Interestingly, the MHV SL1-\u0394A35 revertant mutants bear some resemblance to the predicted secondary structure of a wild-type SL1 from a related group 2 CoV, HKU1. 19,33 HKU1 SL1 does not contain an extrahelical nucleotide but instead is characterized by tandem predicted A\u2022C and G\u2022A mismatches in precisely the same region where 5' UTR SL1 second site mutations map in MHV.\n\nIn addition to the global thermodynamic stability information, the measurement of imino proton exchange gives important insights into the differences in dynamics or flexibility of individual base pairs in different \u0394A35 RNAs. The k ex results show that the lower half of the SL1 is kinetically labile, and the three second site revertant mutants recover one or more dynamic characteristics of the WT* RNA relative to \u0394A35 mutant. Indeed, the closer the site of mutation localizes to A35, the more similar the dynamic properties become relative to the WT* RNA. Therefore, a less stable and more flexible SL1 might facilitate a specific interaction between the single-stranded RNA in this region and a host-or virally encoded protein(s) that is crucial for genome circularization and replication. A cartoon model that graphically illustrates this idea is shown in Figure 9 , where the structure, conformational ensemble or longer-lived partially opened form(s) of SL1, schematized by A1' relative to fully base paired A structure, lowers the energy barrier for formation of a complex with hypothetical protein B, which in turn drives genome circularization and subgenomic RNA synthesis.\n\nWe note that four of five SL1 second site mutations recovered from SL1-\u0394A35 viruses (U33C, C34U, A36U, C37U) map specifically to the 3' strand of SL1, the lone exception being G10A; all recovered viruses therefore maintain a base paired 5'-6 GAGYR 10 sequence in 5' portion of SL1 in MHV. This result suggests that the nucleotide sequence of the 5' region of SL1 may also be important for viability. While this motif is not absolutely essential when the base of SL1 is predicted to be unpaired ( 6 GAG 8 to 6 CUC 8 in the SL1-C virus; Table 1 ), a lethal mutation results when same mutation is introduced while maintaining base pairing here (in the SL1-CD virus; Table 1 ), i.e., in a structural context most similar to that of wild-type MHV. This short sequence motif is conserved and predicted to base paired in all group 2 CoV genomes with the exception of SARS-CoV, which has an 5'-AGGU sequence in what is predicted to be a weakly paired region of SL1 with the A extrahelical. 19 Strikingly, this SL1 5'-6 GAG 8 sequence is identical to the 5'-GAG sequence recovered from second site mutations codeposited in 3' UTR in the same viruses; this suggests the possibility that an oligomer of the same protein(s) capable of recognizing and/or \"melting out\" this short purine-rich motif may well play an important role in mediating a physical interaction between 5' and 3' UTRs. An excellent candidate for this role is hnRNAP A1 since both 3' UTR mutations occur in exactly the same sequence context, 5'-GAAG, a near-consensus binding site for A1, and each replaces the second A with a G, a consensus hnRNAP A1 binding site, 34-35 with the 5'-AG the key specificity determinant. hnRNAP A1 possesses RNA chaperone or helix destabilization activity and has been shown to bind the 3' UTR in MHV, while hnRNP A1 as well as PTB both bind to the complementary strands at the 5' end of MHV RNA. These proteins together mediate the formation of an RNP complex involving the 5'-and 3'-end fragments of MHV RNA in vitro. 36\n\nOur data are compatible with the three-step working model of coronavirus transcription recently refined by Zuniga et al, 13 in which the first step is the formation of 5'-3' UTR form a complex through protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions, by which the TRS-L would be located in close proximity to sequences located at the 3' end of genomic RNA, and in turn, make template jumping from individual TRS-B sequences possible. Overall, we demonstrate that SL1 must possess an optimum stability or kinetic lability required to mediate a key longrange physical interaction between the 5' and 3' UTR that is critical specifically for subgenomic RNA synthesis, but not required for genomic minus strand synthesis. This finding suggests that the structural requirements and/or the nature of the assembled replication complexes that are capable of synthesizing full-length genomic RNA are (is) distinct from those that are capable of synthesizing sgRNAs. Such a functionally bipartite structure where a sub-region of a helical stem below tandem wobble pairs is tuned to an optimum stability is reminiscent of stem I of the U2 snRNA; here, these features have been hypothesized to allow U2 to adopt a number of mutually exclusive folded conformations during spliceosome assembly and catalysis. 37\n\nDBT cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum (HyClone, Logan UT). L2 cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C and 3% CO 2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. Baby hamster kidney-21 cells expressing the MHV receptor (BHK-R) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum, 3% tryptose phosphate broth, and G418 (800 \u00b5g/ml) to select for cells expressing the MHV receptor. MHV-A59 1000 was used as a wild type (WT) control virus for comparison with chimeric viruses.\n\nThe reverse genetic system for MHV-A59 has been described. 38 cDNAs representing the entire MHV-A59 genome with either WT sequence or the MHV SL1 mutant sequences were constructed by ligation of the A fragments to fragments B-G and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase and electroporated into cells as described previously. 19,20 Cultures were observed for up to 72 hours for the development of cytopathic effect and harvested by freezing at \u221270\u00b0C\n\n. Cultures that did not develop cytopathic effect were blind passed three times through DBT cells in a further attempt to recover infectious virus. At least three independent experiments, including at least one experiment in which electroporated cells were incubated at 34 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C, were performed before a mutant genome was considered nonviable.\n\nThe plasmid carrying the MHV-A59 A clone (plasmid A) 38 was used to introduce mutations into the MHV 5' UTR. Briefly, a 0.55-kb BamHI-MluI fragment of A plasmid was amplified and cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) to produce pWt5'UTR-PG, which harbors a T7 promoter, the 209 nts MHV-A59 5'UTR and 257 nts of 5' Orf1a coding sequence. Most mutations were introduced into pWt5'UTR-PG with the Quick Change site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions and confirmed by sequencing. An oligonucleotide assembly strategy 20 was used to introduce the A5G, U40C, \u0394(C16,C19,C20,A35) mutation into pWt5'UTR-PG. The MluI-BamHI fragments containing the desired mutations were introduced into plasmid A by restriction fragment exchange. The region between the MluI and BamHI sites in the resulting cloned plasmids was sequenced to verify that the desired mutation was recovered. The sequences of the mutagenic oligonucleotides are shown in Supplementary Table S1.\n\nMutant viruses were subjected to one round of plaque purification and were expanded once in DBT cells. Total RNA (2 \u00b5g) was reverse transcribed using oligo 8 (Supplementary Table S1 ). Resultant RT products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), then 3' tailing was conducted using Terminal Transferase (Roche) to add a poly(A) tail to the 3' ends of the purified RT products. The poly(A) tailed RT products were re-purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit. A first round of PCR was performed using 10 \u00b5l of the poly (A) tailed RT products with the adapter primer (AP-dT17) and MHV-1RV5 primer. A second round of PCR was performed with 1\u00b5l of a 1:50 dilution of the previous reaction using the adapter primer and the SL1 check (\u2212) primer (Supplementary Table S1 ). The PCR products were gel-purified and sequenced using the SL1 check (\u2212) primer.\n\nReplicate cultures of BHK-R cells were electroporated in parallel with either MHV SL1 mutant genomes, WT genomes, or a the Nsp12-FS mutant [a construct containing a frame shift mutation in nsp12 rendering it incapable of directing virus specific RNA synthesis 20 ] genome and total RNAs were extracted at various times post electroporation (h.p.e.). To determine if the input RNAs, plus any replicated genome RNA, were present in the electroporated cells, the extracted RNAs were primed for reverse transcription by oligo A59(\u2212) 16596-16577, and amplified by PCR using oligo A59(+) 14639-14658 and oligo A59(\u2212) 16596-16577. Resultant PCR products were further amplified by nested PCR using oligo A59(+) 16038-16059 and oligo A59(\u2212) 16596-16577. The RNA species present in cells were further characterized by RT-PCR as described previously. 19,20 Parallel reactions in which reverse transcriptase was omitted from the cDNA step were always performed to ensure that the PCR assay did not detect residual DNA transcription templates which entered the cells during electroporation. qRT-PCR was conducted to determine whether nonviable MHV SL1 mutant genomes synthesize positive-stranded genomic RNA (+gRNA). Total RNAs extracted at 4, 8, and 12 h.p.e. and poly(A) + mRNAs purified using the Oligotex mRNA Midi Kit (Qiagen). 180 ng of poly(A) + mRNAs were used as template for the synthesis of genomic cDNA and GAPDH cDNA with primers A59(\u2212)16577-16596 and GAPDH-R2 using the SuperScript II RNase H-Reverse Transcription Kit (Invitrogen). Then, qPCR was followed to amplify +gRNA with primers A59 (+) 16038-16059 using iQ\u2122 SYBR Green Supermix (BIO-RAD). In parallel, GAPDH was also amplified with primers GAPDH-F2 and GAPDH-R2. After 40 cycles the PCR products were displayed by gel electrophoresis. qPCR reactions with poly A + selected RNA demonstrated that samples were free of detectable DNA.\n\nRNAs were obtained by in vitro runoff transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase and purified by denaturing PAGE essentially as previously described. 39 The NMR samples were subjected to exhaustive dialysis into a final buffer of 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.0) and 100 \u00b5M DSS with RNA concentrations ranging from \u22481 to 2.5 mM in 300 \u00b5L (10% D 2 O). The RNA samples for thermal denaturation experiments and calorimetry experiments were prepared by diluting into a final dialysis buffer of 10 mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 100 mM KCl, and 5mM MgCl 2 . Before each experiment, the RNA samples were annealed by heating at 65\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by slow cooling at room temperature. All samples were \u226590% monomeric as judged by nondenaturing PAGE.\n\nRNA melts were collected on a Cary 1 scanning spectrophotometer operating in double beam mode. The RNA concentrations were between 1-20 \u00b5M, and all melting profiles were shown to be independent of RNA concentration over this range. The first derivative data of absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm with respect to temperature (dA/dT) were subjected to a simultaneous non-linear least-squares fit of \u0394H i , t m,i and A i , for each ith unfolding transition via sequential interacting two-state unfolding transition model using the t-melt program running on a Silicon Graphics O 2 workstation as previously described. 40 Melting profiles were subjected to singleor two-transition unfolding models as described in the text. Parallel thermal melts (50-1 100 \u00b5M RNA strand) were carried out on a Microcal VP-DSC scanning calorimeter under the same solution conditions as previously described. 41 Analysis of these baseline-corrected data with single-transition two-state unfolding model gave fitted parameters in qualitative agreement with those obtained from analysis of the optically monitored thermal unfolding experiments (data not shown).\n\nNMR spectra were acquired on a Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer at the Biomolecular NMR Laboratory, Texas A&M University. The data were processed using NMRPipe 42 and analyzed using Sparky. \u00b6 The imino proton resonance were assigned by the jump-return echo 1D and Watergate homonuclear 1 H-1 H NOESY spectra (\u03c4 mix =300 ms), with reference to an internal standard DSS at 10 \u00b0C. The imino proton exchange rates were obtained by transfer of magnetization from water. 43 The exchange was initiated by selectively inverting the water proton resonance using a Gaussian 180\u00b0 pulse (5.3 ms duration) with exchange delay times ranging from 2 to 850 ms, followed by a weak gradient (0.1 G/cm) applied during the exchange delay to minimize effects due to radiation damping. At the end of the exchange delay, a second Gaussian pulse (2.8 ms) was applied to bring the water magnetization back to the z axis. Imino proton resonances were detected using a gradient-enhanced spin echo sequence. The acquired spectral array was processed using NUTS (Acorn NMR, Inc.) and the intensities of the imino proton resonances of interest were fitted to obtain the imino proton solvent exchange rate k ex using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software) as previously described. 26, 27 \n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.

In all cases, BHK-R cells were electroporated with in vitro transcripts corresponding to the genomes of MHV-A59 1000 (wild type), SL1-A, or a A59/nsp12-FS frameshift mutant incapable of directing the synthesis of viral RNAs. Total RNAs were extracted at the times indicated (4, 8, 12 h post-electroporation) and analyzed by RT-PCR (see Methods) for (a) \"\u2212\" sense antigenomic RNA; (b) \"\u2212\" and \"+\" sense sgRNA 7; or (c) genomic RNA. Note that total RNA is used as the template for reverse transcription in panels A and B; poly(A)+ RNA was used as template in panel C and duplicate samples were analyzed. The arrows indicate the position of the amplicons expected for each RNA species. GAPDH, RNA recovery control. Imino proton regions of 1D jump-return echo spectra acquired at 10 \u00b0C, 10 mM KP i , pH 6.0 for WT* (a), \u0394A35 (b), \u0394A35/U33C (c), \u0394A35/C34U (d) and \u0394A35/A36U (e). Imino protons corresponding to non-canonical base pairs are shown in bold. Note that some spectra (WT*, \u0394A35/U33C, \u0394A35/C34U) are characterized by slow conformational heterogeneity at the base portion of SL1 (A5-U40, G6-C39, and A7-U38 base pairs). The mutations are shaded in red. k ex could not be unambiguously measured for the G8 for the middle three RNAs due to spectral overlap with G15; the same is true of G14 and G17 imino protons in all spectra. In these cases, the average k ex is plotted. The fully based paired SL1 (A, modeled by the \u0394A35 RNA) exists in equilibrium with one or more higher energy conformers (A', WT* and \u0394A35 second site revertants) that are partially unfolded or experience dynamic destabilization as a result of non-canonical pairing. A hypothetical protein (B) binds to both A and A' to form the same partially unwound AB complex, but the affinity of B for A' will be higher since the full energetic cost of unfolding the lower stem will not have to be paid; this interaction then mediates a long distance RNA-RNA, RNA-protein or protein-protein interaction which is crucial for the viral replication. Thermodynamic parameters derived for the unfolding of WT*, SL1-\u0394A35, SL1-\u0394A35/U33C, SL1-\u0394A35/C34U, and SL1-\u0394A35/A36U\n\nRNAs a 7 is expressed relative to the \u0394G\u00b03 7 measured for the SL1-\n\nRNA."}
