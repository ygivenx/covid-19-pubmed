{"title": "Bats and zoonotic viruses: can we confidently link bats with emerging\ndeadly viruses?", "body": "\nDiversity, distribution and biology - Bats vary widely in size and\nform. Their body masses range from 2 g in the bumblebee bat [Craseonycteris\nthonglongyai (Craseonycteridae), the second smallest mammal known] to 1 kg\nin some flying-foxes [Pteropus spp (Pteropodidae)], whose wingspans can\nreach 2 m (Wilson 1997). Among mammals, bats are\nsecond only to rodents in species richness, with more than 1,300 species recognised\ncurrently (Fenton & Simmons 2015). This total comprises almost one fifth of the\nworld's mammal species, with more than 175 genera (Simmons 2005, Wilson & Reeder\n2005) arranged in 20 families.\n\nBats are distributed widely in the world, occurring on all continents, except\nAntarctica. They are the second most widespread order of mammals, surpassed only by\nPrimates due to the wide distribution of humans. Due to their ability to fly, they have\ncolonised many oceanic islands and on some they are the only native mammals (Koopman 1994). Among the families recognised\ncurrently (Fenton & Simmons 2015),\nEmballonuridae, Molossidae and Vespertilionidae occur in both the New and Old World,\nCistugidae, Craseonycteridae, Hipposi- deridae, Megadermatidae, Miniopteridae,\nMystacinidae, Myzopodidae, Nycteridae, Pteropodidae, Rhinolophidae and Rhinopomatidae\noccur only in the Old World, and Furipteridae, Mormoopidae, Natalidae, Noctilionidae,\nPhyllostomidae and Thyropteridae occur only in the New World. Table I provides information on distribution and diet of bats by\nfamily. The evolution of flight - the most peculiar characteristic of bats and one of\nthe most important for their wide distribution - may have had effects on some aspects of\nthe evolution of the immune system and the metabolism of bats, allowing them to host so\nmany viruses (O'Shea et al. 2014, Brook & Dobson 2015).\n\n\n\n\n\nBats are nocturnal mammals (Rydell & Speakman\n1995), with most of them spending the day in roosts and foraging from dusk to\ndawn. In general, they have one or two peaks of activity throughout the night (Fenton 1983). Tropical bats are active year-round\nand those that live in temperate zones either migrate or hibernate to avoid unfavourable\nenvironmental conditions (Fenton 1983, Wilson 1997).\n\nBats exploit a great variety of roosts. They can use hollows (caves, mines, tree trunks,\nbuildings etc.), crevices and foliage as day roosts (Fig.\n1) and many frugivorous and insectivorous bats are known to use night roosts\nfor eating and grooming. Partially eaten fruits and insects and droppings can be found\non the ground of their night roosts (Fenton\n1983) and they are good indicators of the items included in their diet. Fruits\npartially eaten by bats have been used to link bats with emerging zoonotic viruses\n(Chua et al. 2002).\n\n\n\n\n\nBat reproduction is similar to that of other mammals, but mating and duration of\nbreeding season are strongly influenced by hibernation and migration. In hibernating\nbats of various species, copulation generally occurs in the fall, either with ovulation\nand fertilisation occurring immediately, followed by a slow development of the fetus\nthroughout the winter and birth in the spring, or with sperm storage until spring, after\nwhich ovulation, fertilisation and foetal development occurs. In migratory bats, mating\nis generally concentrated in the early spring, after they reach their summer roosts.\nThese bats and several others that do not need to migrate or hibernate, but that live in\nareas with food availability varying seasonally, reproduce once a year (monoestrus),\nwhereas others facing less marked seasonal variation or having food resources available\nyear-round generally reproduce twice or more a year (polyestrus). The former pattern is\ncharacteristic of most insectivorous bats from temperate regions, whereas the latter is\ncommon in most frugivorous bats living in tropical regions. Gestation averages about two\nmonths and bats of most species produce a single young per litter, but a few produce\ntwins and a very few produce three or four young at a time (Wilson 1997). Halpin et al.\n(2000) isolated Hendra virus from uterine fluid and foetal tissues of bats and\nDrexler et al. (2011) found evidence of virus\namplification during colony formation and after parturition.\n\nLife span usually decreases with body size for mammals, with larger animals living\nlonger, but bats are exceptions to this rule; longevity in bats was reviewed by Wilkinson and South (2002). Bats can live 3.5 times\nlonger, on average, than non-volant placental mammals with similar body size (Wilkinson & South 2002) and, considering their\nsize, they live longer than any other mammal (Bouliere\n1958, Austad & Fischer 1991). The\nmaximum age varies greatly from species to species, but while small rodents live in the\nwild about one-two years, a bat with similar body size can live more than 30 years. A\nBrandt's bat [Myotis brandtii (Vespertilionidae)] from Siberia was\nrecaptured 41 years after the first capture (Podlutsky\net al. 2005), but records of bats older than 30 years are known only for bats\nof five species in the wild (Wilkinson & South\n2002). Genome and transcriptome analyses have revealed unique sequence changes\nthat appear to contribute to both the small body size and the long lifespan of bats\n(Seim et al. 2013).\n\nSpecies richness increases toward the tropics and in most tropical areas bat diversity\nis higher than that of any other group of mammals. As an example, in a 3-km radius of a\nrainforest in northern French Guiana, bats of at least 78 species co-exist in the area\nand the diversity analyses indicate that the fauna is not fully sampled (Simmons & Voss 1998). In the same area, 64\nnon-volant mammals have been recorded, including 22 rodents, 12 marsupials, 10\ncarnivores, nine xenarthrans, six primates and five ungulates (Voss et al. 2001). Bats also are the most abundant mammals in\nseveral tropical forests and the wild vertebrates that more often interact with humans,\nalthough most people do not realise it.\n\nBats of some species also form large aggregations and a few of them form the largest\naggregations of mammals in the world. Old World fruit bats (Pteropodidae) of various\nspecies constitute colonies of hundreds of thousands to millions of bats that aggregate\non exposed tree branches (Mickleburgh et al.\n1992, Kunz & Pierson 1994). In\nBracken Cave, central Texas, about 20 million Mexican free-tailed bats [Tadarida\nbrasiliensis mexicana (Molossidae)] form the largest warm-blooded non-human\nvertebrate colony in the world.\n\nAlthough bats are outnumbered by rodents in species richness, they are first among\nmammals (and probably among vertebrates) in dietary diversity (Fenton & Simmons 2015) which includes remarkable adaptations to\nexplore an array of different animal and plant food items (Wilson 1973, 1997, Altringham 1996, 2011). This variety of behaviours has been arranged into eight main feeding\ncategories: fruit eaters, flower feeders, aerial insectivores (those that capture\ninsects in flight), foliage gleaners (capture insects on the ground), carnivores (feed\non small terrestrial vertebrates, including birds, frogs and mammals), fish eaters,\nblood feeders and omnivores (Wilson 1973).\nPhyllostomids - also called New World leaf-nosed bats and restricted to the Neotropics -\ninclude representatives classified in quite distinct categories (Fig. 2A-F), with insect foliage gleaners, carnivores, blood feeders,\nnectar feeders and fruit eaters; the latter mainly grouped into the subfamilies\nStenodermatinae, Carolliinae and Rhinophyllinae. Pteropodids - the fruit bats restricted\nto the Old World tropics (Old World fruit bats) - also include fruit eaters and nectar\nfeeders (Fig. 2G-I). Except for representatives of\nthese two families, bats are primarily animal feeders, generally insect eaters. Some\npteropodid and phyllostomid bats that feed on fruits reject the fibres and other\nindigestible components. They chew and ingest the pulp and juices and drop the fibrous\nmaterial and larger seeds that can be found on the ground below their night roosts. They\nswallow smaller seeds that pass quickly and undamaged through the bat's gastrointestinal\ntract (ca. 20 min). Using a similar strategy to increase feeding efficiency,\ninsect-eaters from various families may cull the insects they prey on, consuming the\nmost nutritional part (the abdomen) and discarding wings, head and appendages (Fenton 1983, Kunz\net al. 2011).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolutionary history - Chiroptera is a middle Paleocene or early Eocene\nlineage of placentals (Simmons et al. 2008,\nO'Leary et al. 2013). This means that bats\nhave evolved apart from other mammalian lineages for more than 50 million years.\nAlthough they have a long history of isolation from other mammals, understanding their\nevolutionary relationships with other groups of mammals and even between bats of\ndifferent families, can provide important clues in investigating physiological aspects\nthat may favour disease spillover events.\n\nBats comprise a monophyletic lineage that has evolved within the superorder\nLaurasiatheria (Van Den Bussche & Hoofer\n2004, O'Leary et al. 2013). This\nsuperorder also includes the order Lipotyphla [formerly Insectivora, but excluding\ntenrecs (Tenrecidae) and golden moles (Chrysochloridae)], Pholidota (pangolins or scaly\nanteaters), Carnivora (carnivores), Perissodactyla (horses, tapirs, rhinoceroses and\nother odd-toed ungulates) and Artiodactyla [pigs, cattle, deer and other even-toed\nungulates; dolphins and whales (O'Leary et al.\n2013)].\n\nSince Dobson's (1875) basal division of\nChiroptera into the suborders Megachiroptera (also referred to as 'megabats', Old World\nfruit bats or flying-foxes) and Microchiroptera ('microbats'), these two groups have\nbeen widely accepted. In this arrangement, Megachiroptera comprised only Pteropodidae\nand Microchiroptera included all other families (Koopman 1994). This classification was widely used for more than a century,\nbut it is no longer accepted by bat systematists. Currently, Yinpterochiroptera\n(Rhinolophoidea + Pteropodidae) and Yangochiroptera (all other families) are the two\nmost basal lineages recognised within the Chiroptera (Springer et al. 2001, Van Den Busshe &\nHoofer 2004). A more in-depth overview of the historical classification of\nChiroptera is available in the Supplementary data. Other information about echolocation\nand ecosystem services provided by bats are available in the Supplementary data as\nwell.\n\nFollowing are some examples of viruses of humans and livestock associated with bats and\nwhich have been important in many ways, including bringing bats to the attention of the\nscientific and medical communities. Studies of these diseases, their causative agents,\nthe peculiar biology of bats, the relationships of bat viruses to other viruses, the\nevolution of these viruses, the causes of disease outbreak initiation (epidemiology),\nthe prevention of diseases and the expanded studies of bats for one reason or another\nlikely will provide more information about the bats themselves and, in the long run,\nhelp us protect bat populations from further decline.\n\n\nSummary of viruses from bats - More than 200 viruses have been isolated\nfrom or detected in bats. Represented are bats of both suborders, 11 families and 37\ngenera (Table II, Supplementary Table II). The viruses are representatives of 27\nvirus families, which is a remarkable diversity (Calisher 2015). This suggests that viruses detected in bats are unlikely to\nbe there by chance, simply a series of oddities. Indeed, when concerted efforts have\nbeen made to search for viruses of specific families, such as coronaviruses (CoVs) and\nherpesviruses, a large number of these viruses were detected and a substantial\nproportion of them have been shown to be previously unrecognised viruses or viral\nsubtypes. Because some investigators search only for particular viruses or for viruses\nof particular families it is certain that many viruses must have been overlooked, so\nthat the lists in the Table II and Supplementary\nTable II surely underrepresent the actual\nsituation in nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRabies - No review concerning bats and viruses can be complete without\nat least a brief summary of this first virus recognised in bats and the classical\naccount of the disease it causes. Numerous books and scientific publications are in\nprint or otherwise available which provide details regarding Louis Pasteur's efforts to\ndevise a vaccine against the disease called rabies (L. rabies, rage,\nmadness). Classical rabies virus (street rabies) is the prototype virus of a complex of\nviruses that have been detected in bats, dogs and other mammals. This negative sense,\nsingle-stranded RNA virus has been classified in the virus order Mononegavirales, family\nRhabdoviridae (Gr. rhabdos, rod) and genus Lyssavirus (Gr.\nlyssa, rage, fury, canine madness).\n\nRabies may be the oldest human infectious disease known. Its origin has been associated\nwith wolves [Canis lupus (Carnivora, Canidae)], now domesticated as\ndogs (C. lupus familiaris). Even as far back as 2300 BC dog owners in\nthe Babylonian city of Eshnunna were fined for deaths caused by their dogs having bitten\npeople. In 500 BC, the Greek philosopher Democritus described a case of canine rabies.\nIn 400 BC, Aristotle wrote 'dogs suffer from the madness. This causes them to become\nvery irritable and all animals they bite become diseased', In the first century, Roman\nwriter Cardanus described the saliva from a rabid dog as a 'virus' (L.\nvirus, poison). In 1804, a German scientist, Georg Gottfried Zinke,\ndemonstrated that rabies could be passed through saliva from rabid dogs.\n\nNonetheless, the geographic distribution of all haematophagous bats (vampire bats),\neither extant or fossil, are restricted to the New World tropics (Koopman 1994). For whatever reasons, whether brought to the New\nWorld or because Trinidad and Tobago and Haiti were foci of rabies and inferred\nassociations of rabies and bats, the mythology and superstitions encompassing bats\nserved as an impediment to research on bats and on infectious diseases. To some extent,\nthough considerably lessening, this remains true.\n\nIt was Antonio Carini (1911) - an Italian\nphysician, bacteriologist and professor and director of the Pasteur Institute of S\u00e3o\nPaulo - who presented findings that rabies of herbivores could be transmitted by bats.\nHowever, the first isolation of rabies virus was from a common vampire bat\n[Desmodus rotundus (Phyllostomidae)] in 1931 (Baer 1991). The same conclusion drawn by Carini was made by Lima (1934), also in Brazil, and Pawan (1936), in Trinidad; the latter also made the\nconnection between fruit-eating bats and paralytic rabies (Pawan 1948). These studies truly turned the direction of rabies,\nvirus and bat research forward, but it was not until relatively recently that other\nviruses and bats themselves came into prominence, as mentioned below.\n\nIn 1903, Adelchi Negri, an Italian physician, reported his observations of what came to\nbe called 'Negri bodies', eosinophilic inclusions found in the cytoplasm of nerve cells\ncontaining rabies virus (Negri 1903).\nRemarkably, it was not until 1953 that the first American case of rabies in a bat was\nreported from Pennsylvania (Witte 1954). For\nmany years thereafter, diagnostic techniques began to be improved, epidemiologic\ninvestigations expanded, specific monoclonal antibodies produced and applied and\ninvestigations of rabies virus put on a molecular basis, but the primary advance in\nrabies diagnosis was the development of an immunofluorescence test in the 1950s, used to\ndetect rabies virus antigens (Goldwasser & Kissling\n1958).\n\n\nRabies virus-related viruses - Other rhabdoviruses have been isolated\nfrom bats (Calisher & Ellison 2012). Aravan\nvirus has been isolated from a lesser mouse-eared bat [Myotis blythii\n(Vespertilionidae)] in Kyrghyzstan, Central Asia, Australian bat lyssavirus, from black\n(Pteropus alecto), gray-headed (Pteropus\npoliocephalus), little red (Pteropus scapulatus) and\nspectacled (Pteropus conspicillatus) flying-foxes (Pteropodidae) and\nyellow-bellied pouched bats [Saccolaimus flaviventris\n(Emballonuridae)], in Australia, Bokeloh virus from a Natterer's myotis [Myotis\nnattereri (Vespertilionidae)] in Germany, Duvenhage virus, from Schreibers's\nlong-fingered bat [Miniopterus schreibersii (Miniopteridae)] and\nEgyptian slit-faced bat [Nycteris thebaica (Nycteridae)] in South\nAfrica, European bat lyssavirus 1, from common serotines [Eptesicus\nserotinus (Vespertilionidae)], European bat lyssavirus 2, from Daubenton's\nbats [Myotis daubentonii (Vespertilionidae)], Irkut virus, from greater\ntube-nosed bats [Murina leucogaster (Vespertilionidae)] in Russia and\nChina, Khujand virus, from a whiskered myotis [Myotis mystacinus\n(Vespertilionidae)] in Tajikistan, Lagos bat virus, first isolated from a African\nstraw-coloured fruit bat [Eidolon helvum (Pteropodidae)] in Nigeria,\nLleida bat lyssavirus, from Schreibers's long-fingered bat in Spain, Shimoni bat virus,\nfrom a Commerson's leaf-nosed bat [Hipposideros commersoni\n(Hipposideridae)] in Kenya and West Caucasian bat virus, from a Schreibers's\nlong-fingered bat in Russia. Mokola virus, although not isolated from bats, also is a\nmember of the rabies-virus related virus group and has been isolated from shrews\n[Crocidura spp (Soricomorpha, Soricidae)] and domestic cats in\nNigeria. Since the initial detections of these viruses, with the exception of Mokola\nvirus, most have been detected in bats of species other than those mentioned above.\nAmong those mentioned above, only pteropodids feed on plants, whereas all others feed on\nanimals, including insects, other invertebrates or vertebrates. \n\nSevere rabies-like disease in humans has led to additional studies of flying-foxes,\nresulting in a greater understanding of the epidemiology and geographic distribution of\nAustralian bat lyssavirus. Based on this evidence, Fraser et al. (1996) suggested that bats may play a more important role in\nthe circulation of virus diseases than had been previously realised.\n\n\nHendra, Nipah and other paramyxovirus diseases - Hendra and Nipah\nviruses are both highly pathogenic zoonotic paramyxoviruses (Mononegavirales, Paramy-\nxoviridae) that have been detected in pteropodid bats within the last decades (Marsh et al. 2012). A horse died of undiagnosed\ncause in 1994 in Queensland, Australia. Eight to 11 days later depression, anorexia,\nfever, dyspnoea, ataxia, tachycardia, tachypnoea and nasal discharge was reported in 17\nother horses from the same area; 14 of them died or were euthanised. Five and six days,\nrespectively, after the death of the index horse, a stable hand and a horse trainer,\nboth of whom had had close contact with the sick horse's mucous secretions, were\ndiagnosed with influenza-like illnesses. The stable-hand recovered, but the trainer\ndeveloped pneumonitis, respiratory failure, renal failure and arterial thrombosis and\nsuccumbed from cardiac arrest seven days after admission to hospital. A paramyxovirus\ncultured from his kidney was shown to be identical to viruses isolated from the lungs of\nfive affected horses. The two affected humans and the horses had antibody to the virus\nand the disease was reproduced in healthy horses following challenge with spleen-lung\nhomogenates from infected horses (Selvey et al.\n1995). Scattered other cases caused by this virus were identified, but\nevidence for its otherwise occurrence were not obtained by testing vertebrates and\narthropods in the associated areas until flying-foxes were tested and the virus isolated\nfrom blood, foetal tissues, uterine fluids, urine, faeces and saliva (Halpin et al. 2000).\n\nThe etiologic agent eventually was named Hendra virus after the Queensland location\nwhere the first cluster of cases occurred. More than one-fifth of the flying-foxes in\neastern Australia were shown to have neutralising antibody to Hendra virus, as did bats\nof multiple species of flying-foxes in New Guinea. In 1996 Hendra virus was isolated\nfrom a flying-fox (Halpin et al. 2000).\nEpidemiologic evaluations suggested that horses become infected with Hendra virus\nvia direct or indirect contact with infected flying-foxes and humans\nbecome infected with this virus via direct contact with infected\nhorses. Disease control has been made by preventing contact between flying-foxes and\nhorses. \n\nA second paramyxovirus detected in flying-foxes is Menangle virus (genus Rubulavirus),\nresponsible for a 1997 zoonotic disease affecting pigs and humans in New South Wales,\nAustralia. Antibodies capable of neutralising Menangle virus were detected in\nflying-foxes, providing provisional evidence of a bat origin for this virus; the virus\nlater was isolated from black flying-foxes (Barr et al.\n2012). Samples of Indonesian bats have revealed the presence of henipavirus\nand rubulavirus RNAs.\n\nIn 1998 yet another paramyxovirus, this one named Nipah virus, was recognised as the\netiologic agent of a fatal disease of humans and pigs in Malaysia and Singapore (Chua et al. 2000). By June of the following year\nmore than 100 fatalities among 250 human encephalitis cases were diagnosed in Malaysia\nand another 11 cases, including one fatality, were diagnosed in Singapore. Initially\nmisdiagnosed as an epizootic of Japanese encephalitis, precious time was lost in\ncontrolling this epizoodemic. Control efforts eventually included culling of all pigs on\naffected farms, an extremely costly measure resulting in the near collapse of the\nbillion-dollar pig-farming industry, heightened animosity between communities and\nelevated administrative costs in Malaysia.\n\nNipah virus was shown to be closely related to Hendra virus of Australia (Chua et al. 2000) and, because of their large\ngenomes, their limited homologies with other paramyxoviruses and other unique\ncharacteristics, these two viruses were placed in a separate genus (Henipavirus) of the\nfamily Paramyxoviridae. Because of the similarity of Nipah and Hendra viruses,\nflying-foxes were suspected as being somehow involved in the epidemiology of Nipah\nvirus. Neutralising antibodies to Nipah virus were detected in pteropodid bats of five\nspecies in Malaysia, suggesting widespread infection in bats there. Soon thereafter the\nvirus was detected in urine of variable flying-foxes (Pteropus\nhypomelanus) and in fruits partially eaten by them, confirming these bats as\nnatural hosts of the virus (Chua et al. 2002).\nTaken together, the epidemiologic portrait was that climatic and human-driven ecologic\nchanges and locations of pig farms in orchards, which are home to fruit bats, provided\nsettings in which Nipah virus can switch species, from fruit bats to pigs to humans.\nNipah virus also has been associated with Lyle's flying-fox [Pteropus\nlylei (Pteropodidae)] in Cambodia (Reynes\net al. 2005) and pteropodids and hipposiderids in Thailand (Wacharapluesadee et al. 2005).\n\nIn early 2001, an outbreak of febrile illness associated with altered sensorium was\nobserved in Siliguri, West Bengal, India; laboratory investigations did not immediately\nidentify an infectious agent. Nipah virus infection had not been previously detected in\nIndia, but because Siliguri is near the border with Bangladesh, where outbreaks of Nipah\nvirus infection had recently been reported, samples obtained during the Siliguri\noutbreak were retrospectively analysed for evidence of Nipah virus infection. Nipah\nvirus-specific IgM and IgG antibodies were detected in nine of 18 patients. Reverse\ntranscriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays detected Nipah virus RNA in urine samples\nfrom five patients. Sequence analysis confirmed that the Nipah virus from humans in\nSiliguri was more closely related to Nipah virus isolates from Bangladesh than to Nipah\nvirus isolates from Malaysia (Chadha et al.\n2006).\n\nIn contrast to transmission of Nipah virus from bats elsewhere, transmission in\nBangladesh was found to be via drinking the sap of date palms\n[Phoenix dactylifera (Arecales, Arecaceae)] and via\nperson-to-person route. Nipah virus RNAs detected in Bangladesh are variable in their\nsequences, suggesting multiple introductions via Indian flying-foxes\nPteropus giganteus (Pteropodiae), which migrate long distances and\nare found in the Maldives, India, Bangladesh, China, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.\n\nRNA of Cedar virus, another henipavirus, was detected in urine of pteropodid bats in\nAustralia in 2009, but little is yet known about this virus (Marsh et al. 2012). Challenge studies with Cedar virus in domestic\nferrets [Mustela putorius furo (Carnivora, Mustelidae)] and\ndomesticated guinea pigs [Cavia porcellus (Rodentia, Caviidae)], both\nsusceptible to infection and disease with known henipaviruses, confirmed virus\nreplication and production of neutralising antibodies, but no clinical disease. Also,\nthe major genetic difference between Cedar virus and Hendra and Nipah viruses lies\nwithin the coding strategy of the P gene, known to play an important role in evading the\nhost innate immune system. Preliminary studies indicated that Cedar virus infection of\nhuman cells induces a more robust interferon-\u03b2 response than does Hendra virus. Cedar\nvirus is one that might be studied to develop a human and livestock vaccine.\n\nIntriguing evidence for infection with a henipavirus in African bats was presented by\nHayman et al. (2008) who reported finding\nantibody to henipaviruses in African straw-coloured fruit bats from Ghana. As a\nfollow-up, Drexler et al. (2009) detected\nhenipaviral RNA in an African straw-coloured fruit bat. Clearly, information regarding\nthe geographic distribution and medical and veterinary importance of the henipaviruses\nand their relationship with bats is not nearly complete.\n\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) - The hundreds of human case\nnotifications of SARS in Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China in late 2002,\nthen elsewhere in the world, moved bat virus recognition from unanticipated and\noccasional to well-planned and more methodical. Thereafter the World Health Organization\n(WHO) put the entire world on alert. SARS cases soon were diagnosed in patients not only\nin Vietnam, but also in Hong Kong and Canada, and cases were diagnosed in health care\nworkers and household members who had cared for patients with the disease. Many of the\ncases were traced back through chains of transmission to a health care worker from\nGuangdong Province who had visited Hong Kong, where he was hospitalised with pneumonia\nand died. By late April 2003, more than 4,000 SARS cases and 250 SARS-related deaths\nwere reported to the WHO from more than 25 countries. Most of these cases occurred after\nexposure to SARS patients in health care or household settings.\n\nThe WHO coordinated a massive international collaborative effort that included clinical,\nepidemiologic and laboratory investigations and simultaneously initiated efforts to\ncontrol the spread of the disease. Attempts to identify the causative agent of the\noutbreak were successful during 2003, when laboratories in the United States of America\n(USA), Canada, Germany and Hong Kong isolated a novel CoV (SARS CoV) from SARS patients.\nClassified as a virus in the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae and genus CoV,\nunlike other human CoVs, this one can be isolated in Vero cells. SARS CoV RNA has\nfrequently been detected in respiratory secretions and convalescent-phase serum\nspecimens from SARS patients contain antibodies that react with SARS CoV, altogether\nproviding evidence that it was a newly recognised virus and associated with the disease.\nThe source of the virus in nature had not been determined at that time,\nbut knowing it was a CoV made the search easier.\n\nCoVs comprise a diverse group of large, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that\ncause respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and other animals. Their genomes are\nthe largest (about 30,000 nucleotides) of any RNA virus known. A great deal is known\nabout CoVs, nicely summarised by Ksiazek et al.\n(2003) and Rota et al. (2003) in their\npapers describing molecular and other characteristics and properties of SARS CoV and\ncomparing its genome to the genomes of other CoVs.\n\nMany possible natural history scenarios - among others, human infections originating\nwith masked palm civets [Paguma larvata (Carnivora, Viverridae)] and\nraccoon dogs [Nyctereutes procyonoides (Carnivora, Canidae)] in live\nmarkets of wild animals in mainland China - were proposed, but were more confusing than\nhelpful to our understanding of the origin and spread of the virus. Poon et al. (2005), searching for the SARS CoV in\nHong Kong bats, came close to succeeding, being the first to detect a CoV (group 1,\ni.e., alphacoronaviurs) in bats; a retrospective study of samples collected for other\npurposes demonstrated the presence of an alphacoronavirus RNA sequence in an Australian\nbat captured in 1996 (LL Poon, unpublished observations). Then Lau et al. (2005) and Li et al.\n(2005) reported detections of (group 2, i.e., betacoronavirus) SARS CoV-like\nviruses in bats, thus providing evidence that bats are a natural source of at least some\nof the numerous alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus found world-wide (Osborne et al. 2011). By now, partial descriptions\nof many hitherto unrecognised coronaviral sequences have been published in the\nscientific literature. Without more biological and epidemiological information it is\ndifficult to determine whether these represent newly recognised viruses, are closely or\ndistantly related strains or are more items to add to lists; these are not tabulated in\nTable II. Obviously, evidence of the presence\nof many important viruses in bats has served to invigorate studies of the biology of\nbats themselves as well as the discovery of disease-associated viruses.\n\n\nMiddle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) - MERS is caused by a CoV\ncalled MERS CoV. Cases of this disease were first reported from Saudi Arabia by ProMED\nand formally published soon after (Bermingham et al.\n2012). MERS affects the respiratory system and most MERS patients develop\nsevere acute respiratory illness with fever, cough and shortness of breath. The\ncase-fatality rate of MERS is about 45%. Through retrospective investigations, health\nofficials later showed that the first known cases of MERS occurred in Jordan in 2012.\nThus far, all cases of MERS have been linked to countries in and near the Arabian\nPeninsula. This virus has spread from ill people to others through close contact, such\nas caring for or living with an infected person. As of 23 January 2015, there have been\n956 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS CoV infection, including 351 deaths, a large\nproportion of whom had pre-existing co-morbidities. Because of its similarity to the\nSARS CoV, it had been anticipated that bats were somehow involved in transmission of the\nMERS CoV and Memish et al. (2013) detected a\npartial RNA sequence of a betacoronavirus with 100% identity to virus from the human\nindex case-patient. This nucleotide sequence was obtained from a faecal pellet from an\nEgyptian tomb bat [Taphozous perforatus (Emballonuridae) (Memish et al. 2013)] in Saudi Arabia, and a close\nrelative of this virus was detected in a Zulu serotine bat [Neoromicia\ncf. zuluensis (Vespertilionidae)] by Ithete et al. (2013) in South Africa. However, recent studies have\nsuggested that one-humped camels [Camelus dromedarius (Artiodactyla,\nCamelidae)] may be a primary source of this virus in nature (Raj et al. 2014) and experimental infections of\ncamels with MERS CoV seem to support this view (Adney\net al. 2014). MERS CoV continues to cause disease in the Arabian Peninsula,\nbut is not expected to cause a pandemic.\n\n\nMarburg and ebolavirus haemorrhagic fevers - Marburg and ebolaviruses -\n(Mononegavirales, Filoviridae), genera Marburgvirus and Ebolavirus, respectively, the\n'filoviruses' - were discovered because they cause severe, often fatal, haemorrhagic\ndiseases in humans and other primates.\n\n\nMarburgvirus disease - In late summer of 1967, an haemorrhagic fever\noutbreak was observed in laboratory workers in Serbia, at the time part of Yugoslavia\nand in Germany. It was soon shown that the disease was transmitted from green monkeys\n[Chlorocebus sabaeus (Primates, Cercopithecidae)] consigned from\nUganda to Europe, but the origin of the disease was unknown, other than that it was\ncaused by a hitherto unrecognised virus, named Marburg virus for the city in Germany\nwhere the disease was first recognised. Another infection with this virus occurred in a\ntraveller in Africa in 1975 and cases of Marburg haemorrhagic fever have been documented\nwith some frequency in various parts of Africa since then. Although a great deal was\nlearned about this virus from pathologic and laboratory studies, its epidemiology\nremained undetermined. Nonetheless, bits and pieces of evidence suggested that bats\nmight be associated with Marburg virus. It was not until 1999 that Swanepoel et al. (2007) detected Marburg virus RNA in Egyptian\nrousettes, eloquent horseshoe bats [Rhinolophus eloquens\n(Rhinolophidae)] and a greater long-fingered bat [Miniopterus inflatus\n(Vespertilionidae)] captured in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Towner et al. (2009) isolated genetically diverse\nMarburg viruses from Egyptian rousettes. Marburgviruses are now placed in the genus\nMarburgvirus, species Lake Victoria marburgvirus.\n\n\nEbolavirus diseases - In 1976, a series of severe and often fatal\nhaemorrhagic fevers occurred in southern Sudan. Almost immediately after those cases\nwere recognised, a similar disease was observed in humans in Zaire, now known as the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, nearly 1,000 km away. A virus, originally termed\n'Ebola virus', named after the Ebola River near the epidemic site in Zaire, was isolated\nfrom patients in Zaire and partially characterised (Johnson et al. 1977) but, as with Marburg virus, early intensive field\nstudies did not reveal the source of the virus. The virus detected in Zaire eventually\nwas named Zaire ebolavirus and the distinct virus from Sudan was named Sudan\nebolavirus.\n\nA third ebolavirus, Reston ebolavirus, was discovered in 1989 when an outbreak of\nanorexia, nasal discharge, splenomegaly and haemorrhaging was recognised among\ncrab-eating macaques [Macaca fascicularis (Primates, Cercopithecidae)]\nimported from a commercial source in the Philippines to a primate holding site in\nReston, Virginia, USA. No human illnesses among animal handlers were recognised (Jahrling et al. 1990). Then, in 1994, clinical\ninvestigations into the haemorrhagic illnesses and deaths of common chimpanzees\n[Pan troglodytes verus (Primates, Hominidae)] in the Ta\u00ef Forest of\nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire resulted in an accidental infection and non-fatal illness of an\ninvestigator performing a necropsy on one of these primates. Virus isolation from this\npatient was successful and the virus named Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus. The cause of deaths of\nthe members of the chimpanzee group was later shown to be infection with this virus.\nThis was the first time that a human ebolavirus infection had been connected to\nnaturally-infected non-human primates in Africa (Le\nGuenno et al. 1995).\n\nEpidemiologic and virologic investigations of an epidemic of haemorrhagic fever in\nhumans in western Uganda in 2007 revealed the cause as being Bundibugyo ebolavirus,\nnamed for the district in Uganda where the epidemic occurred. This virus is more closely\nrelated to Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus than it is to other ebolaviruses, but is distinct from\nthem all (Towner et al. 2008).\n\nIn sum, since 1967 filoviruses have been the cause of very serious and focal or\nwidespread haemorrhagic fever outbreaks in Africa, as well as in the USA, although the\nlatter experience was limited to imported monkeys. Most of the haemorrhagic fever\noutbreaks or epidemics have had case-fatality rates of 50-90%. The identified index\ncases in these situations have been shown to have been in contact with\nebolavirus-infected primates or other large vertebrates, either killed or found dead in\nforested areas. Because bats have been shown to harbour various filoviruses and because\nthey are used as protein sources by human and free-ranging non-human-primates in some\nparts of Africa, Asia and perhaps elsewhere, eating and other contacts with an\nebolavirus may result in virus transmission and epidemic initiation. The validity of\nsuch a scenario remains to be proven.\n\nA novel filovirus, provisionally named Lloviu virus (the only virus in the genus\nCuevovirus), was detected during the investigation of bat die-offs in Cueva del Lloviu\nin Spain in 2002. Lloviu virus is genetically distinct from marburgviruses and\nebolaviruses and is the first filovirus detected in Europe that was not imported from an\nendemic area in Africa. Whereas infections of bats with marburgviruses and ebolaviruses\ndo not appear to be associated with disease in the bats, Lloviu virus was detected in a\ndead Schreibers's long-fingered bat.\n\nSurvival of bats from experimental infections led Swanepoel et al. (1996) to list Wahlberg's epauletted fruit bats\n[Epomophorus wahlbergi (Pteropodidae)], little free-tailed bats\n[Chaerephon pumilus (Molossidae)] and Angolan free-tailed bats\n[Mops condylurus (Molossidae)] as potential hosts for Zaire\nebolavirus. In addition, from 2001 and 2003, Leroy et\nal. (2005) collected small vertebrates at sites where non-human primates had\ndied at the border between Gabon and the Republic of the Congo. They detected RNA of an\nebolavirus in hammer-headed fruit bats (Hypsignathus monstrosus),\nFranquet's epauletted fruit bats (Epomops franqueti) and little\ncollared fruit bats (Myonycteris torquata). These RNA sequences were\nquite similar to those of the ebolavirus isolated from humans during the 1976 outbreak\nin Zaire. Other investigations led to antibody detections in bats of the same species.\nLeroy et al. (2005) detected ebolaviral RNA\nfrom them and from other pteropodids and molossids as well (Olival & Hayman 2014). This has been the ostensible link for an\nassociation of bats with Zaire ebolavirus and con\ufb01rmed their speculation that\nebolaviruses circulate in the forests of Central Africa (Leroy et al. 2005). The West African ongoing outbreak that is\nravaging Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, initiated more than one year ago, has\nsickened more than 20,000 people and killed more than 8,000 of them to date. Although\nthese countries are geographically closer to the Ivory Coast than the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo and South Sudan, Baize et al.\n(2014) demonstrated that this strain is phylogenetically closer to the Zaire\nebolavirus than is the Ta\u00ef strain. Gire et al.\n(2014) provided support for this hypothesis, their data suggesting that the\nWest African variant diverged from the Zaire ebolavirus (central African lineage) about\n2004.\n\nBased on the work of Leroy et al. (2005),\nfrugivorous bats were tentatively linked to the ongoing outbreak in West Africa (Baize et al. 2014), but field investigations raised\na new scenario for the emergence of the virus. According to Sa\u00e9z et al. (2015), the index case (a 2-year-old boy from the small\nvillage of Meliandou, Guinea) may have been infected by playing in a hollow tree used to\nhouse a colony of Angolan free-tailed bats - a species widespread in Central and West\nAfrica. The tree was burned and the colony no longer lives in the hollow. During field\ninvestigations Sa\u00e9z et al. (2015) found no\ninfected bats; however, Angolan free-tailed bats are among those that have survived\nexperimental infections (Swanepoel et al. 1996).\nThus, the accumulated evidence, while implicating bats in transmission of many viruses,\nmay only be coincidental and remains unproven.\n\nIn addition to their other well-known uniquenesses, it may be asked whether bats have\nunique responses to virus infections. That is, why (or how) do bats survive infections\nwith viruses and other agents that are pathogenic for other vertebrates? Or do they?\nThese questions have not been answered satisfactorily and data accumulated thus far have\nnot definitively answered them, but have led to speculation, much of which is\nfascinating. Serologic studies demonstrated that bats have antibody to many viruses, but\nit was not determined whether their antibody isotypes were similar to those of other\nmammals. Nearly 50 years ago, for example, Sulkin et\nal. (1966) maintained big brown bats [Eptesicus fuscus\n(Vespertilionidae)] experimentally infected with Japanese encephalitis virus at\nvarious environmental temperatures and then tested them for both virus and neutralising\nantibody. Viraemias were demonstrable in most of these bats within two-three days after\ninfection and persisted for one-two weeks. However, not all viraemic bats produced\nantibody to the virus, a few others had equivocal and then delayed (nearly 2 months)\nantibody responses and some that had produced antibody soon after being infected no\nlonger had detectable antibody three months later.\n\nWe know that bats produce IgM, IgG, IgA and IgE antibodies, but not whether these bat\nimmunoglobulins react as do similar immunologic isotypes of other vertebrates. There are\nclear differences between bats of different species. For example, only a single IgG\nsubclass has been identified in Seba's short-tailed bats [Carollia\nperspicillata (Phyllostomidae)], whereas little brown myotis [Myotis\nlucifugus (Vespertilionidae)] have five IgG subclasses (Butler et al. 2011). One can conclude from this\nthat bats of different species differ, which is not enlightening taxonomically, but is\ninformative in regard to the danger of making generalisations about bats.\n\nNow that bats have been shown to host hundreds of viruses, some of them important\npathogens of humans, interest in and studies of the immunological responses of bats has\nincreased; data accumulated recently have been fascinating and informative (Baker et al. 2013a, Epstein et al. 2013, Zhang et al.\n2013). Baker et al. (2013b) have\nnicely reviewed the literature concerning antiviral immune responses in bats and the\nreader is encouraged to see that publication.\n\nDead or sick bats have been the source of viruses of bats (Supplementary Table II), but these have principally been focused\non rabies virus because of the importance of that virus and because of the attendant\nemphasis on studies of its occurrence, geographic distribution and genotype. Finding\ndead or sick bats with other viruses is not a common occurrence, likely due to the rapid\nscavenging of dead animals under natural conditions, although meticulous searching may\nindicate otherwise (M\u00fchldorfer et al. 2011).\nSuch studies may provide information useful to our understanding of sex differences,\nseasonality and other aspects of the prevalence of viruses in bats. Even the highly\npathogenic rabies virus has been detected in apparently healthy bats (Davis et al. 2012). How rabies virus and other\nviruses persist over time certainly depends on a mechanism for such persistence, but\nthat mechanism is unclear at this time, although it is being slowly revealed (Blackwood et al. 2013).\n\nNonetheless, it is unusual to find dead or sick bats. That at least some viruses have\nbeen detected in apparently healthy bats, which must be netted or otherwise sampled in\nthe field, has led to hypotheses that centre on the possibility that bats somehow\ntolerate at least certain virus infections and this has encouraged investigators to\nquestion whether bats can allow virus infections, remain asymptomatic, yet respond to\nsuch infections differently from the ways in which other mammals respond to them.\n\nIn an effort to provide a foundation for understanding adaptations by bats that might\nallow them to at least somewhat peacefully coexist with viruses that infect them, Papenfuss et al. (2012) assembled transcriptome\nsequences from immune tissues and cells of black flying-foxes. They identified 18,600\ngenes, of which 650 (3.5%) corresponded to immune genes and about 500 of which were\nidentified, providing information regarding innate and adaptive immunity of these bats.\nThese and other results suggested that bats have many genes consistent with those in\navailable databases, but which may represent bat-specific transcripts. Alternatively, a\ntranscriptome data set of Shaw et al. (2012)\nrepresenting Jamaican fruit-eating bats [Artibeus jamaicensis\n(Phyllostomidae)] differs somewhat from that of Papenfuss et al. (2012), indicating yet another difference between bats of\ndifferent species.\n\nOther studies of bat genomes have indicated differences in genes associated with early\nimmune responses, which might allow virus to replicate in the absence of a primary and\nhearty immunological response. It is further reasonable to assume that this in turn\nmight allow at least low-level virus replication over an extended period. There is some\nevidence that these genes may be evolving more rapidly in bats than in vertebrates of\nother taxa, which would suggest that the genes are co-evolving with the bats in response\nto viral and other infections. An additional note of caution: when studying viruses from\nbats in order to understand their effects, it is clearly more appropriate to use bats or\ntheir cells in culture, rather than other hosts or cells from other hosts. That is,\nsimply because a virus or other pathogen might interfere with or activate a gene product\nin one host, there is no certainty that it does the same in another host; thus the\nextrapolatory and speculatory nature of many available publications. A recent paper by\nZhang et al. (2012) provides a new insight\ninto the interplay between bat host and infecting virus. The authors isolated a novel\n\u03b2-herpesvirus from a Schreibers's long-fingered bat and, in determining its complete DNA\ngenome sequence, found it to be the first virus genome known to encode major\nhistocompatibility complex (MHC) class II homologues. The authors proposed future\nfunctional studies of these MHC class II homologues to determine whether they may play a\nrole in potentially novel virus immune evasion pathways (Zhang et al. 2012). This remarkable finding may change the way we\nview both bats as hosts and viruses as pathogens.\n\nHumans and most other mammals respond to infections by activating their immune systems\nat the time they are infected, usually producing type I and type III interferons, which\nare temporising responses activated prior to humoral antibody responses. The immune\nsystems of bats of at least one species (black fling-fox), on the contrary, appear to be\nperpetually switched on at a low level, thus allowing them to respond quickly to an\ninfectious agent (Zhou et al. 2014).\nAlternatively, bats may have a potent innate or inherent immunity, one that is more\nefficient in restricting viral replication or even restricting innate immunity (Siu et al. 2014).\n\nHibernation - the state of inactivity in which the heart rate, body temperature and\nbreathing rate are decreased in order to conserve energy - has been put forth as a\ncontributor to viral persistence in bats. Bouma et al.\n(2010) have summarised the physiological and immunological effects of\nhibernation as also including depressed metabolism, lower numbers of circulating\nleukocytes, lower complement levels, decreased response to lipopolysaccharides and lower\nphagocytotic capacity, cytokine production, lymphocyte proliferation and antibody\nproduction. They suggest that hibernation may increase infection risk in bats. Further,\nit has been proposed that the rapid reestablishment of immune responses in bats emerging\nfrom hibernation and infected with the white-nose syndrome fungus,\nPseudogymnoascus destructans (Ascomycota, Pseudeurotiaceae), may\nbring about a severe immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (Meteyer et al. 2012).\n\nHibernation also may allow not only virus persistence in the bat, but trans-seasonal\npersistence as well, allowing virus to amplify and re-emerge when conditions are more\namenable to transmission, such as seasonally for arthropod-borne viruses, colony\nformation and movement to maternity caves.\n\n\nBats and emerging viruses - More than 200 viruses of 27 families were\nisolated from or detected in bats of both suborders. A few of these viruses have been\nresponsible for human diseases, including isolated events or disease outbreaks that have\nresulted in human deaths and bats have been tentatively blamed for some of these\nepisodes (e.g., ebolavirus disease, SARS, MERS). Because bats represent such a large\nproportion of mammals (about 20%) and are so diversified in their biology, habitats and\nnatural history, it seems reasonable to assume that they have many hundreds more\nviruses, just as do other diversified groups of life forms. A few hypotheses have been\nraised to explain so many viruses in bats (O'Shea et\nal. 2014, Brook & Dobson 2015).\nHowever, as to whether these viruses are important or not, whether bats are simply\nincidental hosts of viruses and whether they serve as competent reservoir hosts of\nviruses and transmit them to other vertebrates are open questions that must be carefully\naddressed.\n\nIn general, the supposed connections between bats and disease outbreaks caused by\nzoonotic viruses have been raised more on speculation than on evidence supporting their\ndirect or indirect roles in the epidemiology of those diseases (Fenton et al. 2006). In most cases, the only evidence is the\nisolation or otherwise detection of the same viruses in bats and humans in areas where\nthe diseases have emerged, but this does not mean that bats are the hosts for the\nviruses. The identification of the same virus in bats and humans might only be evidence\nthat as mammals they are similar enough to serve as temporary hosts for the virus and\nthe same virus can also be found in other terrestrial vertebrates (e.g., primates,\nantelopes, birds) and arthropods (Calisher et al.\n2006, Melaun et al. 2014). As an\nexample, Ross River virus has been isolated from gray-headed flying-foxes, but these\nbats did not produce viraemia of sufficient magnitude to be considered competent\nreservoir hosts for this virus (Ryan et al.\n1997). Alternatively, Seymour et al.\n(1978a) detected specific antibodies of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus\nin bats of seven different species from Guatemala. Based on this evidence, Seymour et al. (1978b) experimentally infected bats\nof five species. Viraemia was detected in most bats, but all were asymptomatic for the\ninfection. They concluded that the phyllostomids Jamaican fruit-eating bats, great\nfruit-eating bats (Artibeus lituratus) and little yellow-shouldered\nbats (Sturnira lilium) had circulating virus levels high enough to\ninfect culicid mosquitoes (Diptera, Culicidae) that may serve as vectors for the virus,\nwhereas great spear-nosed bats [Phyllostomus hastatus (Phyllostomidae)]\ndid not develop sufficient viraemia to infect subsequently feeding mosquitoes (Seymour et al. 1978b). Based on these results, we\ncan speculate that there is variability of the immune responses of bats to virus\ninfections, particularly in representatives of closely related species.\n\nAmong the scores of viruses and viral sequences identified from bats (Table II), several have been isolated or detected\nin bat tissues or excreta. However, this does not prove a relationship between the\npresence of a virus (or its nucleic acid sequence, albeit a nucleotide sequence is not a\nvirus) and the disease the virus might cause. Some of these viruses or viral sequences\nmight have been in food eaten by bats and at least some (or most) are irrelevant with\nrespect to viral disease epidemiology.\n\nBecause of the many gaps in our knowledge linking bats and zoonotic viruses, associating\nbats with these events without any further evidence is a disservice, with negative\nconsequences for bats and humans. For bats, because it puts them on target for 'control'\nand it disseminates fear among the general public. For humans, because putting efforts\nto control the wrong reservoir or disease carrier can postpone appropriate mitigation\nactions that could avoid more deaths or interrupt the spread of the disease and because\na potential 'control' of bat populations may deny us their important ecosystem\nservices.\n\nAs mammals, bats share many physiological and immunological traits with humans.\nAdditionally, they are in constant contact with humans, with bats of different species\nroosting in human-made constructions, feeding or hanging on fruit trees or flying around\nlight poles to feed on insects in urban and rural areas. These habits increase their\ncontact with humans, domestic animals, livestock and wildlife, potentially favouring\nspillovers.\n\nAfter analysing most of the disease outbreaks that have been tentatively linked to bats,\nit is obvious that there are at least two transmission routes: from bats directly to\nhumans and from bats to humans through intermediate hosts or vectors. The first one\nseems to be possible via bites during occasional interactions with bats\nin roosts or bats on the ground (Sa\u00e9z et al.\n2015) and through contact with bat fluids during capturing and preparing them\nas food (apes, other primates and carnivores can be infected while feeding on bats).\nHowever, transmission by contact or ingestion of infected droppings in bat roosts cannot\nbe discounted (Sa\u00e9z et al. 2015), inasmuch as\nviruses or viral nucleic acid sequences have been retrieved from urine and faeces of\nbats (Halpin et al. 2000). The disease caused by\nthe Zaire ebolavirus is a potential example of this route.\n\nVirus transmission from bats to humans through intermediate hosts seems reasonably and\nlogically the link to explain the outbreaks of Nipah and Hendra diseases. However, one\naspect of these links has been overlooked. Only animals phylogenetically closer to bats\nappear as intermediate hosts. Most spillover episodes had horses and pigs linking bats\nand humans. In other events, camels and carnivores (ferrets, palm civets and raccoon\ndogs) also figure among the mammals in which viruses apparently circulate. Except for\nhumans, these mammals are from groups that have evolved within the superorder\nLaurasiatheria. Horses are representatives of the order Perissodactyla, pigs and camels\nare in the order Artiodactyla and ferrets, palm civets and raccoon dogs are in the order\nCarnivora; all are members of the superorder Laurasiatheria.\n\nAlthough bats have been distinct from other mammals for more than 52 million years,\nbats, carnivores perissodactyls and artiodactyls share part of their evolutionary\nhistory that is not shared with other mammals and their ancestors may have co-evolved\nwith ancient lineages of certain viruses. This suggests that they may share\nphysiological characteristics that could facilitate circulation of these viruses. Dobson (2006) visited pig farm sites where\noutbreaks of Nipah virus infections occurred in Malaysia and found partially eaten\nfruits with bat teeth marks in them. According to Dobson (2006), pigs may have been contaminated by eating fruits that had been\npartly eaten by bats and subsequently passed the virus to humans. This hypothesis was\ntentatively rejected by Fenton et al. (2006)\nbased on the argument that pellets rejected by frugivorous bats are composed of\nindigestible fibres and seeds that have little nutritional value for animals. However,\none of us (RM) several times has found on the ground fruits that had been partially\neaten by bats (e.g., Fig. 3); there is no reason\nto believe that other frugivorous or omnivorous mammals, such as primates and\ncarnivores, do not feed on them. Given that Chua et al. (2002) detected Nipah virus in\nfruits partially eaten by variable flying-foxes, this general scenario seems very\nreasonable. Using Dobson's (2006) hypothesis as\na background, pigs became infected with Nipah virus by eating virus-contaminated fruits\nand then humans became infected by spillover from pigs, which may have occurred by\ncontact with massive quantities of viruses in the mucosae, faeces or excreta of infected\nanimals. Haematophagous insects may also be virus vectors. Melaun et al. (2014) provided an extensive list of viruses that\nhave been identified in bats, haematophagous insects and humans. With bats spending most\nof their time stationary and upside down, some of them forming large groups, they are\nperfect targets for feeding arthropods, particularly mosquitoes. However, it is unlikely\nthat arthropods are important vectors of filoviruses, paramyxoviruses and many other\nviruses, including rabies virus, as they have not been detected in them even though\nmillions of them have been tested. Mechanical transmission of viruses, however, is\nalways a possibility, but is irrelevant when discussing natural hosts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe taxonomic and geographic distribution of bats whose viruses have potentially jumped\nto humans is also noteworthy. Except for rabies, all episodes are in the Old World and\npteropodid, hipposiderid and rhinolophid bats - representatives of families in the\nsuborder Yinpterochiroptera - have been mostly involved (Table II, Supplementary Table\nII). To date, there is no direct evidence that New World bats play important\nroles in the transmission of zoonotic viruses, other than rabies virus, to humans. This\nmight be caused by a sampling bias because most studies have been concentrated in the\nOld World tropics; but most studies are concentrated in the Old World because people and\nlivestock are dying there from those diseases. However, it may not be a biased view.\nDifferences in the evolutionary history and biology of New and Old World bats and in\nhuman behaviour may provide reasonable explanations. From an evolutionary viewpoint, Old\nWorld bats occur in a region where the mammalian fauna was established long ago and\nthose bat lineages may have coevolved with viruses that may have been present in other\ngroups of mammals. In this scenario, bats might have developed strategies to survive\nvirus infections. On the other hand, the assemblage of New World mammals (in particular\nthat from South and Central America) was dramatically reshaped about three million years\nago due to the Great American Biotic Interchange (Marshall et al. 1982) and bat and virus lineages may not have had time to\ncoevolve. In addition, all New World bats are in the suborder Yangochiroptera, whereas\npteropodids, hipposiderids and rhinolophids are in the suborder Yinpterochiroptera. The\nbasal divergence among these suborders is almost as old as the divergence of bats and\nother mammals (Springer et al. 2001). Thus, we\nspeculate that bats in these two groups may have evolved distinct immunological\ncharacteristics that provide distinct responses to pathogens, with direct implications\nregarding their roles as hosts. From an ecological viewpoint, some pteropodid bats tend\nto form large aggregations that may favour virus spread, whereas New World fruit bats\nusually form smaller aggregations. Also, except for a few native indigenous peoples, in\nthe New World bats are not on the menu, which is different from Africa and Asia where\nthese animals are consumed regularly. Eating them seems not to be a problem because\ntheir meat is cooked. The problem appears to be in the contact with their infected blood\nand other body fluids during handling and preparing their meat. Contact with massive\nquantities of viruses unquestionably favours spillovers. The above suggestions here are\nno more than speculations pending formal assessment.\n\n\nFuture investigations - We still know comparatively little about the\nimmunological and physiological systems of wild mammals of different orders. With bats\nbeing potential reservoirs of a long list of viruses (Table II, Supplementary Table II) and\npossibly harbouring more zoonotic viruses than mammals of any other group (Luis et al. 2013), including some deadly viruses\n(Wynne & Wang 2013), it is necessary to\nunderstand the mechanisms of immune resistance that allow bats to harbour pathogens, the\npathogenetic bases of infectious diseases in bats and the mechanisms underlying disease\nemergence (Calisher et al. 2006, Dobson 2006, Daszak et al. 2013, Mandl et al.\n2015). To address these issues, it is necessary to perform eco-epidemiological\nfield studies and laboratory experiments using bats and bat cell cultures. Bat cell\nlines derived from tissues of bats of different taxa and strains of laboratory animals\nneed to be established to provide the necessary conditions for in vitro and in vivo\nexperiments.\n\nTo develop strains of laboratory animals, several aspects of the biology, natural\nhistory and distribution of the potential models must first be considered. To diminish\nrisks of accidental species introductions and minimise effects of potential accidental\nreleases into the native fauna, we suggest selection of autoctone species (those from\nthe local fauna) that have continental distributions as potential models to test\nenzootic (or endemic) viruses. As an example, Pallas's mastiff bats [Molossus\nmolossus (Molossidae)] are potential models for research in South America.\nThey are widely distributed on the continent, adapt well to human constructions and feed\non insects (Nowak 1994, Eger 2008), making them easy to maintain in captivity. We suspect\nthat under controlled conditions their reproductive rates may be maximised and, after a\nfew generations, physiologically uniform strains could be obtained.\n\nIn addition, fieldwork is necessary to continually searching for new pathogens and to\nunderstand the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of zoonotic diseases. It is important\nto design field studies to understand the role of different biotic and abiotic factors\naffecting bat populations and pathogen circulation in bats and how these factors may\nfavour spillovers to humans (e.g., habitat disruption, faunal poverty, climate change)\n(Chua et al. 2002, Parrish et al. 2008, Daszak et al.\n2013, Wynne & Wang 2013, Sa\u00e9z et al. 2015).\n\nJoining expertise from bat biologists and medical investigators, this scenario can\nquickly move forward to a new one in which the role of bats in the circulation of\nzoonotic viruses and other pathogenic agents will be at least minimally understood.\nAfter understanding the role of bats (or other animals) in the maintenance and\ncirculation of pathogens and the mechanisms underlying the emergence of zoonotic\ndiseases, wildlife biologists and epidemiologists should work together to develop\nappropriate management plans to control virus circulation and minimise risks of human\ninfection without causing significant biases against specific animal populations. We\ncannot ignore the potential role of bats in the maintenance, circulation and\ntransmission of pathogens to humans and we cannot ignore the important ecosystem\nservices provided by these animals. Thus, the only possible approach is to develop\nresponsible research to avoid the obstacles and keep safe both human and bat\npopulations. In addition, wildlife biologists and medical investigators should work\ntogether to provide expertise to wildlife epidemiologists. This training could be\nprovided by graduate programs in public health.\n\nFinally, can we confidently link bats with emerging viruses? No, or not yet, is the\nqualified answer based on the evidence available. Only integrative and organised field\nand laboratory research, using ecological and epidemiological approaches conducted by\nbat biologists and medical researchers, will provide a useful and satisfactory\nsolution."}
