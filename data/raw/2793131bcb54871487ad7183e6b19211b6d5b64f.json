Though announcing the outbreak of the COVID-19 as the sixth major public health 36 emergency worldwide [3] . Thus, to prevent the spread of this new coronavirus, it is 37 necessary health-care staffs and decision maker, governments and the people to 38 work together. Moreover, it is recommended that all potentially exposed subjects to 39 be isolated for 14 days, suggesting isolation is the best way to contain this epidemic advance directions, and design upcoming research [5, 6] .

Due to 51 the rapid growth of publishing articles in this field, the aim of this article is to assess 52 the publication pattern of Covid-19 research globally. This study systematically 53 assessed the publication distribution, stratified by geography, institution, funding 54 sponsors, journals, and more. We also assessed the frequency of keywords and 55 then employed Bibliometric mapping tools to demonstrate developments on Covid-56 19. Results were analyzed to further understand the structure of this field and to 57 anticipate developments on Covid-19 research. Furthermore, this study can provide 58 information for funding agencies to establish elated guidelines on Covid-19 research. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10. 1101 TO ( PUBYEAR , 2020 ) OR LIMIT-TO ( PUBYEAR , 2019 ).
