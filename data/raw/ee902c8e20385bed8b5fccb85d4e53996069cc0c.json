{"title": "Human Kidney is a Target for Novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection Running title: SARS-CoV-2 infects human kidney", "body": "In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. [1] [2] [3] This disease, now designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) by the WHO, rapidly spread to other cities of China and around the world. (angiotensin converting enzyme-II) molecules via its Spike protein. 10 In addition to respiratory organs, the expression of ACE2 protein has also been observed in human kidneys, 11, 12 and Cheng et al., reported that some COVID-19 patients had an elevated level of proteinuria. 13 However, no evidence directly demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 can infect the kidney to cause acute renal failure.\n\nWe retrospectively analyzed the clinical data on kidney function from 85 cases of COVID-19 who were admitted into the General Hospital of Central Theatre Command in Wuhan, Hubei Province, from January 17, 2020 to March 3, 2020 . To elucidate the mechanism of renal injury, we also used H&E staining and immunohistochemistry to visually assess tissue damage and viral presence in kidney tissues from six biopsies. \n\nWe reviewed clinical records and laboratory findings for all the patients. All information was obtained and curated with a customized data collection form. eGFR was calculated by the CKD-EPI equation based on serum creatinine level, sex, race and age. Acute renal impairment was defined as a decline of eGFR by at least 30% of the baseline value on admission or below 90mL/min on admission. Three investigators (C Wang, Z Fen and Y Chen) independently reviewed the data collection forms to verify data accuracy.\n\nTissue morphology detection and immunohistochemistry Due to the special infection-control precaution of handling deceased subjects with COVID-19, postmortem examination was performed in a designated pathology laboratory. Kidney specimens from autopsy were retrieved for standard examination via light microscopy.\n\nBriefly, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were cut into 3 \u03bcm slices and mounted onto poly-lysine-coated glass slides, and tissue injury was stained for by H&E. Sections were also used for immunohistochemistry as following: Antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving these sections in citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0). The sections were then incubated in 3% BSA plus 0.1% H2O2 for 1h at RT to block nonspecific binding. The is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. Role of the funding source The funding agencies did not participate in study design, data collection, data analysis, or manuscript writing. The corresponding authors were responsible for all aspects of the study to ensure that issues related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work were properly investigated and resolved. The final version was approved by all authors.\n\nWe retrospectively analyzed laboratory kidney functions from 85 cases of COVID-19 patients, and focusing on eGFR. Results showed that 27.06% (23/85) COVID-19 patients exhibited acute renal failure. Patients who are elderly (\u226560 years) or carry comorbidities (65.22% vs 24.19%, p<0.001, 69.57% vs 11.29%, p<0.001, respectively), such as hypertension (39.13% vs 12.90%, p=0.0007) and coronary heart disease (21.74% vs 4.84%, p=0.018) more easily developed ARF (Table1), suggesting renal function impairment is relatively common in COVID-19 patients.\n\nNext, the histopathological examination was performed by H&E-staining in kidney specimens from autopsy of six COVID-19 subjects with observed renal function impairment. Varying degrees of acute tubular necrosis, luminal brush border sloughing and vacuole degeneration, were found in different areas of all six renal specimens.\n\nSevere infiltration of lymphocytes in the tubulointerstitium was observed in two patients, and moderate infiltration was seen in three cases, and the remaining one case manifested absence of lymphocyte infiltration. Moreover, viral infection associated-.

At the same time, dilated capillary vessels were observed in the glomeruli of these 6 cases. Nevertheless, severe glomerular injury was absent in all of these six cases, although benign hypertensive glomerulosclerosis and autolysis were noted in three hypertensive patients (Figure 1, Table 2) . Collectively, these results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection mainly induces severe acute tubular necrosis and lymphocyte infiltration.\n\nTo confirm that SARS-CoV-2 might directly infect kidney tubules thus lead to tubular damage, the viral NP antigen was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results showed that SARS-CoV-2 NP antigens could be seen in kidney tissues from all of these six samples, with NP expression restricted to kidney tubules, and NP-positive inclusion body was also observed. The NP-positive expression was observed in cytoplasm, but nuclear signals were not observed (Figure 2A) . Some NP-positive tubular epithelial cells were dropped from normal tubules (Figure 2B) , while NP-antigen was also absent in the glomerulus (Figure 2C) . The expression of NP protein in lung tissues from COVID-19 patients was used as positive controls (Figure 2D) , whereas normal kidney tissues ( Figure 2E ) or renal sections from unrelated autopsies treated with rabbit isotype control antibodies ( Figure 2F ) were used as negative controls. Collectively, these data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects kidney tubules.\n\nSince the infiltration of proinflammatory cells can significantly accelerate tubular damage, we next examined the identity of these infiltrated cells. Immunohistochemistry showed strong presence of CD68 + macrophages were in the tubulointerstitium of these six cases, while moderate numbers of CD8 + T cells were also observed in two cases, whereas, CD4 + T cells and CD56 + natural killer (NK) cells were seldom found in the examined tissues ( Figure 3A, Table 2 ), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might cause further tubular damage through recruiting macrophages to infiltrate into the .

Interestingly, strong C5b-9 depositions on tubules were observed in all of these six cases. Very low levels of C5b-9 deposition on glomeruli and capillaries were also seen in two cases. However, C5b-9 expression is absent in normal kidney tissue ( Figure 3B, Table 2 ), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces acute tubular necrosis and ARF through triggering C5b-9 deposition.\n\nIn this study, we found that 27.06% of patients with COVID-9 had abnormal eGFR, and patients who are aged or have comorbidities more commonly developed ARF ( Table 1 \n\nThis phenomenon is different from the 2003 outbreak of SARS, in which ARF was uncommon, despite being one of the top risk factors for mortality. 15 Recently, Yan et al., reported that 63% (32/51) of COVID-19 patients had an elevated level of proteinuria. 13 Collectively, these results illustrate that SARS-CoV-2 mediated ARF may be one of the major causes of multiorgan failure and eventual death in COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe extents of tubular atrophy and interstitial disease are the strongest histological parameters which correlate with renal function and predict progression. To further analyze how SARS-CoV-2 affects renal function, we focused on analyzing renal tissue morphology from autopsies. H&E staining showed that acute renal tubular damage and lymphocyte infiltration was observed in all six cases during postmortem examinations, while the glomeruli were intact, except for some cases with slight glomerulosclerosis, suggesting that other conditions such as hypertension and diabetic nephropathy may have been involved in the pathogenesis (Figure 1) . It has been shown that the ACE-2 receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is highly expressed in renal tubules. 12, 16 We used .

This phenomenon is consistent with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both of which can also infect human kidneys. 17, 18 Recently, some researchers have reported they have successfully isolated SARS-CoV-2 virus particles from the urine of COVID-19 patients, suggesting that kidney-originated viral particles may enter the urine through glomerular filtration. Taken together with our study, these results demonstrate that the kidney is also a site of viral infection and replication outside of the lungs.\n\nWhile SARS-CoV-2 is a cytopathic virus which can also directly induce renal tubular injury during infection and replication, the occurrence of such injury may also initiate complex immune responses. After all, although host immune cells can infiltrate into infected tissue to counteract viral replication, hyperactivation of immune cells may instead promote fibrosis, induce epithelial cell apoptosis, and cause microvasculature changes. [19] [20] [21] We report here that SARS-CoV-2 virus recruits high levels of CD68 + macrophages to infiltrate into the tubulointerstitium (Figure 3A) , suggesting that proinflammatory cytokines derived from macrophages would induce tubular damage.\n\nBoth clinical and experimental models suggest that the abnormal presence of serumderived complement components in the tubular lumen leads to the assembly of the complement C5b-9 (via the alternative pathway) on the apical brush border of tubular epithelial cells (TECs), and that this is an important factor in the pathogenesis of tubulointerstitial damage. [22] [23] [24] We here observed that SARS-CoV-2 initiates complement C5b-9 assembly and deposition on tubules (Figure 3B) . We therefore demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 causes tubular damage through direct cytotoxicity, but also initiates immune-mediates tubule pathogenesis.\n\nOne limitation of this paper is that due to the high infectivity and the complexity of specimen preparation, we were unable to present electron microscopy imaging to further clarify the subcellular distribution of virus particles in kidney in situ. In the next step, we will cooperate with other laboratories to carry out this work.\n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can directly infect human renal tubules and consequently lead to acute renal tubular injury. Moreover, improvement of eGFR would increase the survival of COVID-19 patients who have ARF. We strongly suggest that applying potential interventions including continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT) for protecting kidney function in COVID-19 patients, particularly for ARF cases, maybe a key method to preventing fatality.\n\nThe authors declare no financial or commercial conflict of interest.\n\nYuzhang .
