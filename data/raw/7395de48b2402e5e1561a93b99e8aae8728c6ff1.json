{"title": "RNA-binding activity of TRIM25 is mediated by its PRY/SPRY domain and is required for ubiquitination E-mail: Gracjan.Michlewski@ed.ac.uk Running Title: RNA-binding protein TRIM25 KEYWORDS: Novel RNA-binding proteins, TRIM25, RNA-protein interactions, RNA- binding domain, PRY/SPRY", "body": "More than 300 novel RNA-binding proteins have been identified in HeLa (Castello et al., 2012) , HEK293 (Baltz et al., 2012) and mouse ES cells (Kwon et al., 2013) . Furthermore, a recent study identified 393 new RNA-binding proteins unique to cardiomyocytes (Liao et al., 2016) . Strikingly, many of these proteins were not previously known for their RNA-binding properties and do not contain canonical RNA-binding domains. Intriguingly, E3 ubiquitin ligases from the Tripartite Motif (TRIM) family (TRIM25, TRIM56 and TRIM71) are among these newly identified RNA-binding proteins. TRIM proteins have a characteristic architecture that includes RING zinc-finger, B-Box, coiled-coil (CC) and variable C-terminal domains. There are over 80 TRIM proteins in the human genome, and they have been divided into 11 subfamilies based on their structural composition (Versteeg et al., 2013) . The largest subfamily (C-IV) of 33 TRIM proteins is characterized by the PRY/SPRY domain at the Cterminal end. Most the proteins from the TRIM family are involved in innate immune responses (Jefferies et al., 2011; Rajsbaum et al., 2014; van Tol et al., 2017) . For example, TRIM25 plays a role in the RIG-I-mediated interferon response to viral RNAs (Ozato et al., 2008; Versteeg et al., 2013) . RIG-I recognizes viral RNA molecules with a 5'-triphosphate (5'-ppp-RNA) (Yoneyama et al., 2004) and initiates a downstream signaling cascade that culminates with the expression of type I interferons (interferon \u03b1 and \u03b2 ) (Loo and Gale, 2011) and an anti-viral response. TRIM25 mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, which leads to efficient recruitment of its downstream partners. Such recruitment in turn triggers the interferon response (Gack et al., 2007) . Recently, TRIM25 was shown to be required for the antiviral activity of RNA-binding Zinc Finger Antiviral Protein (ZAP) Zheng et al., 2017) . Almost nothing is known about the RNA-mediated roles and characteristics of these RNA-binding E3 ligases.\n\nbinding activity in vitro ( Fig. 1c-1d ). EMSA analysis with increasing amounts of His-TRIM25\u0394RBD revealed no shift in the pre-let-7a-1 substrate (Fig. 1c) . Likewise, RNA pulldown assays in HeLa cell extracts showed that endogenous and T7-tagged TRIM25 were efficiently pulled down with pre-let-7a-1, whereas T7-tagged TRIM25\u0394RBD was not (Fig.   1e ). These results strongly indicate that the TRIM25 PRY/SPRY domain harbors its RNAbinding activity.\n\nImportantly, some RNA-binding proteins must dimerize to be able to bind RNA (Feracci et al., 2016; Lunde et al., 2007) . Since TRIM25 is known to dimerize and tetramerize through its CC domain with minimal contributions from the PRY/SPRY (Koliopoulos et al., 2016; Li et al., 2014; Sanchez et al., 2014; Streich et al., 2013) , we decided to generate TRIM25 knockout (KO) cells, which removed any confounding effects of endogenous TRIM25. To obtain TRIM25 KO cells we used CRISPR/Cas9 targeting followed by clonal selection and dot blot analysis. This strategy yielded several HeLa cell clones with complete loss of TRIM25 expression ( Figure S2a ). For further analysis, we selected clone C3 ( Figure S2b ).\n\nNext, we performed RNA pull-down assays in extracts from the TRIM25 KO cells with T7-TRIM25\u0394RBD and additional TRIM25 truncations (Fig. 1d) . These experiments confirmed that neither T7-TRIM25\u0394RBD nor T7-TRIM25\u0394CC retained RNA-binding activity (Fig. 1f) .\n\nImportantly, neither T7-TRIM25\u0394PRY/SPRY nor T7-TRIM25-PRY/SPRY could bind RNA ( Fig. 1g ). This shows that the TRIM25 CC domain is essential, whereas the isolated PRY/SPRY domain is not sufficient for binding to RNA. These results suggest that TRIM25\n\nbinding to RNA could be dependent on its CC-mediated dimerization and are in line with previous results, which linked the CC domain with TRIM25's RNA-binding activity (Kwon et al., 2013) .\n\nAll rights reserved.

To test this, we overexpressed T7-tagged TRIM25 with EGFP-tagged TRIM25 (with or without the \u0394 RBD mutation) in TRIM25 KO cells and performed anti-T7 coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays (Fig. 2a) . Our results showed that both wild-type T7-TRIM25 and T7-TRIM25\u0394RBD could interact with EGFP-TRIM25 (Fig. 2a) . The control experiment revealed that the T7 antibody co-IPed T7-tagged but not EGFP-tagged TRIM25\n\n( Fig. 2b) . Moreover, we confirmed that T7-TRIM25\u0394CC or the isolated T7-TRIM25-PRY/SPRY domain could not form multimeric complexes with EGFP-TRIM25 (Fig. 2c) .\n\nImportantly, both the wild-type and TRIM25\u0394RBD recombinant proteins displayed a similar\n\nTm (43 C o ) in a thermal denaturation assay ( Figure S1b ). Furthermore, using Size Exclusion Chromatography with Multi-Angle Light Scattering (SEC-MALS), we established that there was no difference in the elution profiles between the wild-type and the mutant protein ( Figure   S1c ). The MALS-measured mass distribution for His-TRIM25 was 263 \u00b1 5.3 kDa, with an Mw/Mn of ~ 1.01. The His-TRIM25\u0394RBD had values of 258 \u00b1 5 kDa, and \u2265 1.003 Mw/Mn. This suggests that both wild type and TRIM25\u0394RBD formed tetramers in our preparation.\n\nTaken together, these results show that TRIM25 harboring a \u0394 RBD mutation still supports interactions in trans with another TRIM25 molecule and that the \u0394 RBD mutation does not influence the overall folding or multimerization of the TRIM25 protein.\n\nTo find TRIM25-interacting proteins, we performed co-IPs of T7-tagged TRIM25 in HeLa cells coupled with quantitative SILAC mass spectrometry. In brief, wild-type T7-tagged TRIM25 was expressed in HeLa cells, and the co-IP was performed using protein A agarose beads coupled with the anti-T7 antibody (Fig. 3a) . The control cells (without T7-TRIM25) were grown in \"heavy\" medium, and the cells expressing T7-tagged TRIM25 were grown in detected in the co-IP with T7-TRIM25 but not T7-TRIM25\u0394RBD, although the RNase treatment resulted in only a decreased interaction (Fig. 3e) . Importantly, many proteins that were enriched in the T7-TRIM25\u0394RBD and RNase-treated T7-TRIM25 assays were associated with ribosomal and translation functions ( Fig. 3b-3c ). They represent RNAindependent interactions with TRIM25 (Table S1) . Surprisingly, the T7-TRIM25\u0394RBD and RNase-treated T7-TRIM25 co-IPs detected several proteins that were not seen in the wildtype T7-TRIM25 co-IP. This could be due to a synthetic effect of the mutation, lack of binding to RNA or unspecific binding events. Altogether, these results reaffirm that the PRY/SPRY domain is important for RNA-binding and show that TRIM25 interacts with many RNA-binding proteins, using RNA as a scaffold.\n\nWe set out to find out if TRIM25 KO results in global perturbation of protein levels. To do so we used SILAC mass spectrometry on the wild type and TRIM25 KO HeLa cells. Our results showed that the levels of only a few proteins were affected more than twofold (Table S2) .\n\nAmong the affected proteins we found ZAP, which was substantially upregulated in TRIM25\n\nKO cells when compared with the wild type cells. Western blot analysis of the wild type and KO cells validated this observation (Fig. 3f) . To see if TRIM25-dependent proteasome degradation of ZAP contributes to its lower levels in the wild type cells we treated the cells with proteasome inhibitor MG132. Upon MG132 treatment we noticed increase of ZAP levels only in the wild type cells but not in the TRIM25 KO cells ( Figure S2c ). The signal corresponding to ubiquitin was elevated in both wild type and TRIM25 KO cells ( Figure   S2d ). Importantly, overexpression of T7-TRIM25 but not T7-TRIM25\u0394RBD or catalytically inactive T7-TRIM25\u0394RING decreased the levels of ZAP in TRIM25 KO cells ( Figure S2e ).\n\nThese results demonstrate that TRIM25-mediated proteasome degradation of ZAP contributes All rights reserved.

Furthermore, these results suggest that the functional interaction between TRIM25 and ZAP is RNA-dependent.\n\nTo detect endogenous RNA substrates of TRIM25, we performed UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitations in HeLa cells transiently expressing T7-tagged TRIM25, followed by high-throughput sequencing of TRIM25-associated RNAs (CLIP-seq). After UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, we observed a specific RNA-protein complex ( Figure S3a ). CLIPseq of T7-TRIM25\u0394RBD resulted in a lack of detectable RNA-protein interactions (data not shown). The RNA from the T7-TRIM25/RNA complex was isolated using a CLIP-seq protocol and sequenced on a HiSeq platform. Data analysis and cluster identification using pyCRAC (Webb et al., 2014) revealed a significant correlation between three biological replicates with a correlation coefficient between clusters from 0.94 to 0.96 ( Figure S4 ). Five thousand five hundred and forty-nine clusters were common between all three experiments, and we identified 2611 distinct transcripts (Table S3) . Importantly, there was no correlation between transcript abundance, measured by a separate RNA-seq assay, and the cluster intensities, with a Pearson correlation of 0.1 ( Figure S5 ). This shows that TRIM25 does not simply bind the most abundant RNAs but has a substrate preference. Among the identified transcripts, mRNAs and lincRNAs were the most abundant (Fig. 4a ). GO-term annotation of TRIM25-bound transcripts revealed several nodes including RNA processing and translation, WD repeats, phosphorylation and ubiquitination ( Figure S6a ).\n\nTo determine the TRIM25 binding sequence preference, we used the pyMotif program from the pyCRAC package and WebLogo on identified clusters to search for enriched k-mers.\n\nWhile no single strong consensus motif was identified, we found that TRIM25 prefers All rights reserved.

This was confirmed by a bioinformatics analysis showing a significantly higher GC content in TRIM25 clusters compared to random transcripts or random exons (p-values for both comparisons were 2.2e-16) (Fig. 4c ). When we clustered our consensus motifs we found some discrete, G and C-rich short motifs (Fig. S6b ).\n\nIn the future, it will be interesting to check if any of these motifs contribute towards TRIM25's RNA-binding specificity. Next, we assessed the distribution of TRIM25 binding in mRNAs. This revealed that most binding sites are in exons (56%), with the 3'UTR also prominently represented (23%) (Fig. 4d) . Furthermore, we observed a noticeable enrichment of TRIM25 clusters just after the stop codon (Fig. 4e ). TRIM25 binds to its own transcript, which could be biologically important ( Figure S3b ). Intriguingly, even though TRIM25 is localized to both nucleus and cytoplasm (Choudhury et al., 2014) intron binding events were not common in CLIP-seq analysis. This could be demonstrated on TRIM25 mRNA target -c-Myc. Both high throughput CLIP-seq and TRIM25 RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP) followed by targeted amplification of c-Myc transcript showed that TRIM25 predominantly interacts with mature mRNA ( Figure S3c -S3d). Nevertheless, TRIM25 interacts with many RNA-binding proteins (Fig. 3) and they could provide a platform for interactions with other targets at the level of pre-mRNAs.\n\nTo validate the CLIP-seq experiments, we performed RIP followed by qRT-PCR of selected TRIM25 targets in HeLa cells overexpressing either wild-type T7-TRIM25 or T7-TRIM25\u0394RBD ( Fig. 4f-4g) . RIP qRT-PCR with the wild-type TRIM25 showed significant enrichment of tested mRNAs (Fig. 4f) and miRNAs (Fig. 4g) . Intriguingly, the T7-TRIM25 RIP signal on TRIM25 mRNA was much higher than that on other substrates (Fig. 4f ). This could not be explained by increased levels of TRIM25 mRNA, which was upregulated only three-fold when compared to the mock-transfected control (data not shown). Importantly, T7-All rights reserved.

As the T7 antibody could co-IP many nascent TRIM25 peptides, which were still associated with the TRIM25 mRNA, the RIP signal would be increased. Altogether, these results uncover the first TRIM25/RNA interactome. This suggests that TRIM25 RNA-related functions may extend well beyond the regulation of pre-let-7 uridylation toward other aspects of RNA metabolism. Finally, these data clearly demonstrate that one of the main TRIM25 targets is its own mRNA.\n\nTo gain further insights into TRIM25's role in RNA metabolism we have used qRT-PCR to analyze mRNA levels of selected targets (the same ones as assayed by RIP in Fig. 4f -g) and ZAP mRNA in the wild type and TRIM25 KO cells. The majority of analyzed transcripts did not display substantial difference between wild type and KO cells ( Figure S7a Figure S7c -e). This suggests that the steady-state ZAP mRNA level change seen in the TRIM25 KO cells is due to transcriptional control. This is not surprising as a recent study revealed that TRIM25 is a potent transcriptional regulator (Walsh et al., 2017) . Further indepth and high throughput experiments will be needed to fully understand the potential role of TRIM25 in RNA metabolism.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We confirmed that TRIM25 undergoes autoubiquitination by co-overexpression and co-IP of T7-tagged TRIM25 together with HAtagged ubiquitin ( Figure S8a-S8b) . This was also confirmed by the in vitro ubiquitination experiments described below. Next, we asked if binding of TRIM25 to its own mRNA augmented TRIM25 ubiquitination. To address this, we overexpressed EGFP-TRIM25 or EGFP-TRIM25\u0394RBD in HeLa cells and assayed for TRIM25 ubiquitination. We used EGFP fusion proteins to distinguish overexpressed and endogenous TRIM25. The overexpression of EGFP-TRIM25 led to the appearance of modified EGFP-TRIM25 ( Fig. 5a-5b) . However, upon EGFP-TRIM25\u0394RBD overexpression, the intensity of the modified band was noticeably reduced (Fig. 5a-5b ). Of note, we had to use more EGFP-TRIM25\u0394RBD plasmid to achieve protein expression comparable to that of EGFP-TRIM25. Surprisingly, overexpression of EGFP-TRIM25, but not EGFP-TRIM25\u0394RBD, led to significant accumulation of modified forms of endogenous TRIM25, with much higher ratios of the modified forms compared to the non-modified form ( Fig. 5a-5b) . These results suggest that the intact RBD is required for efficient ubiquitination. They also show that endogenous TRIM25 can be modified by EGFP-TRIM25 to a much greater extent than EGFP-TRIM25 modifies itself. One important difference between endogenous TRIM25 mRNA and the mRNA coding for EGFP-TRIM25 is the presence of 5' and 3' UTRs, which were shown to bind TRIM25 in the CLIP-seq experiments ( Figure S3b ).\n\nTo determine if the TRIM25 3'UTR can contribute to ubiquitination of TRIM25, we used a catalytically dead T7-TRIM25\u0394RING construct, which cannot undergo autoubiquitination, All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/200410 doi: bioRxiv preprint and transfected it into TRIM25 KO cells. We also used a T7-TRIM25\u0394RING_3'UTR construct that contained the TRIM25 3'UTR. Notably, we had to use more T7-TRIM25\u0394RING_3'UTR plasmid to achieve protein expression comparable to that of T7-TRIM25\u0394RING (Fig. 5c ). This is most likely connected to microRNA/3'UTR-mediated control of protein expression. As predicted, T7-TRIM25\u0394RING does not support efficient autoubiquitination (Fig. 5c ). However, upon EGFP-TRIM25 overexpression, we noticed the appearance of ubiquitinated forms of T7-TRIM25\u0394RING ( Fig. 5c-5d ). We could not detect abundant ubiquitination bands in T7-TRIM25\u0394RING when EGFP-TRIM25\u0394RBD was cooverexpressed ( Fig. 5c-5d ). Even so, the ratio between the ubiquitinated and main bands still showed a positive value, most likely due to weaker expression of T7-TRIM25\u0394RING in the presence of EGFP-TRIM25\u0394RBD and to background noise. Importantly, when we cooverexpressed the T7-TRIM25\u0394RING_3'UTR construct with EGFP-TRIM25, we observed a noticeable increase in the ratio of ubiquitinated vs non-ubiquitinated bands for TRIM25\u0394RING, when compared with the T7-TRIM25\u0394RING construct without the 3'UTR ( Fig. 5c-5d ). To prove that the observed modification of TRIM25 was specific to K117 we performed similar analyses with T7-TRIM25\u0394RING_K117R constructs. We did not observe modification of T7-TRIM25\u0394RING_K117R in the absence or presence of EGFP-TRIM25 ( Figure S8c ). Altogether, these results strongly suggest that RNA elements such as the 3'UTR, as well as TRIM25 binding to the RNA, contribute to TRIM25 ubiquitination.\n\nTo test if RNA is necessary for efficient TRIM25 ligase activity, we performed in vitro ubiquitination assays with various TRIM25 constructs (Fig. 6a) . Incubation of T7-TRIM25 or T7-TRIM25\u0394RBD IPed from HeLa cells with recombinant proteins from the ubiquitin pathway (Ube2D3, UBE1, and Ubiquitin) revealed efficient, time-dependent ubiquitination of All rights reserved.

Residual ubiquitination of TRIM25\u0394RBD could arise from the direct transfer of ubiquitin from Ube2D3 to the substrate. Next, to show that the observed ubiquitination was specific and dependent on the intrinsic activity of TRIM25, we assayed T7-TRIM25\u0394RING and T7-TRIM25K117R. Neither T7-TRIM25\u0394RING nor T7-TRIM25K117R was efficiently ubiquitinated compared to wild-type T7-TRIM25 (Fig. 6c) .\n\nThis confirmed the specificity of the in vitro ubiquitination assay. Finally, to see if TRIM25\n\nubiquitin-ligase activity was dependent on RNA, we performed the ubiquitination assay in the absence or presence of RNase A/T1. Remarkably, treatment with RNase A/T1 severely inhibited in vitro ubiquitination of T7-TRIM25 (Fig. 6d) . Interestingly, RNase A/T1 treated reactions still supported Tim25 monoubiquitination. This could be due to the direct transfer of ubiquitin from Ube2D to TRIM25. These results strongly indicate that RNA constitutes an important component of the TRIM25 ubiquitin ligase activity.\n\nTo further verify our findings and test whether other TRIM proteins with PRY/SPRY domains could have RNA-binding potential, we prepared constructs encoding chimeric proteins, where the TRIM25 RBD was substituted with homologous sequences from several TRIM proteins (TRIM5, TRIM21, TRIM27 and TRIM65) (Fig. 7a) . Moreover, we designed a TRIM25 construct with a scrambled amino acid sequence of the TRIM25 RBD (Fig. 7a) . The chimeric TRIM25 protein constructs expressed in HeLa cells showed various levels of modification ( Fig. 7b) . Importantly, neither T7-TRIM25\u0394RBD nor T7-TRIM25RBD_src was ubiquitinated (Fig. 7b) . To see if these results translated to RNA-binding efficiency, we performed RNA pull-down assays with pre-let-7a-1 in HeLa cell extracts. Control assays confirmed that T7-TRIM25 could but T7-TRIM25\u0394RBD could not bind RNA (Fig. 7c ). All All rights reserved.

Notably, we did not observe modified bands for TRIM25 in the RNA pulldown assays because the total protein amounts loaded on the gel were one order of magnitude lower than those in the overexpression experiments. To our surprise, there was a strong positive correlation (correlation coefficient 0.87, p-value 0.01) between protein modification and RNA pull-down efficiencies (Fig. 7f) . Altogether, these results imply that RNA-binding is an important element in TRIM25 ubiquitination efficiency and suggest that many other TRIM proteins with the PRY/SPRY domain could harbor yet uncharacterized RNA-binding potential.\n\nTo test if RNA was necessary for efficient ubiquitination of ZAP, a physiologically important TRIM25 target, we performed in vitro ubiquitination assays of ZAP (ZAPS) with the TRIM25 constructs described earlier (Fig. 6a) . Incubation of T7-ZAP with T7-TRIM25 or T7-TRIM25\u0394RBD IPed from HeLa cells with recombinant proteins from the ubiquitin pathway revealed efficient time-dependent ubiquitination of ZAP by TRIM25 but not TRIM25\u0394RBD (Fig. 8b) . Notably, to see efficient ubiquitination of ZAP we had to use higher concentrations of recombinant proteins from the ubiquitin pathway than those used for TRIM25 autoubiquitination experiments. As a result, TRIM25 autoubiquitination was much more pronounced in experiments with ZAP ( Fig. 8a) than seen in the case of TRIM25 only assays (Fig. 6b) . Furthermore, it has been recently reported that ZAP enhances TRIM25 autoubiquitination . Next, to show that the observed ZAP ubiquitination was specific and dependent on the activity of TRIM25, we assayed T7-TRIM25\u0394RING and T7-TRIM25K117R. TRIM25\u0394RING but not T7-TRIM25K117R lost the ability to ubiquitinate T7-ZAP (Fig. 8b) . Intriguingly, we observed autoubiquitination of T7-TRIM25K117R, which All rights reserved.

Finally, to see if TRIM25 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity towards ZAP was dependent on RNA, we performed the ubiquitination assay in the absence or presence of RNase A/T1. Importantly, the treatment with RNase A/T1 severely inhibited in vitro T7-ZAP ubiquitination by T7-TRIM25 (Fig. 8c) .\n\nThese results strongly indicate that TRIM25 uses RNA as a scaffold for efficient ubiquitination of its protein targets.\n\nTRIM25 E3 ubiquitin ligase is a new RNA-binding protein with a role in Lin28a-mediated uridylation of pre-let-7 transcripts (Choudhury et al., 2014) . Here, we revealed that the RNAbinding activity of TRIM25 is contained in its PRY/SPRY region. We also presented the first high-throughput analysis of the molecular interactomes of TRIM25. We showed that TRIM25 is a bona fide RNA-binding protein that associates with many proteins involved in RNA metabolism and interacts with numerous coding and non-coding transcripts. This suggests that TRIM25 could play a role in the regulation of RNA metabolism. Our data showed that TRIM25 binding to RNA and to the 3'UTR of TRIM25 mRNA in particular can augment its autoubiquitination. Finally, we demonstrated that RNA is an important constituent of TRIM25's ubiquitin ligase activity towards itself and its physiologically relevant protein target ZAP. Recently, ZAP was shown to suppress HIV-1 replication by binding CG-rich regions in viral RNAs (Takata et al., 2017) . Intriguingly, the first paper that described ubiquitin conjugation to substrates showed that tRNA is required for selected ubiquitination reactions (Ferber and Ciechanover, 1986) . We propose a model whereby the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM25 is substantially enhanced by using RNA as a scaffold (Fig. 9a) .\n\nAlternatively, binding of TRIM25 to RNA could enhance its ubiquitin ligase activity by All rights reserved.

These models should be verified by detailed structural analysis of the free and RNA-bound TRIM25. Finally, it is exciting to speculate that many other E3 ubiquitin ligases could depend on binding to RNA.\n\nOur results carry very important, functional implications given that the 3'UTRs are platforms for regulatory RNA-binding proteins and that the lengths of the 3' UTRs associated with specific mRNAs are variable. For example, cancer cells have mRNAs with much shorter 3' UTRs, which exhibit increased stability and produce more proteins in part through the loss of microRNA-mediated repression (Mayr and Bartel, 2009 ). Additionally, the shortening of 3'\n\nUTRs is associated with proliferating T cells but is not accompanied by a corresponding change in protein levels (Gruber et al., 2014) . For these reasons, regulation of the lengths of the 3' UTRs could allow for tight control of the type and amount of TRIM25 that is associated with specific mRNAs and the subsequent ubiquitination/ISGylation of nascent peptides. This could be an important mechanism in the physiological and pathological control of protein stability and function. Importantly, TRIM25 also binds to the 5'UTRs of mRNAs and within coding regions. Thus, the RNA-related functions of TRIM25 might not be limited to 3'UTRs.\n\nThis could result in different functions depending on where in the RNA the TRIM25 binds.\n\nPreviously, the CC domain of TRIM25 has been implicated in binding to RNA (Kwon et al., 2013) . TRIM25 deletion mutants lacking the CC domain were unable to interact with RNA in the UV immunoprecipitation and T4 polynucleotide kinase assays (Kwon et al., 2013) . In contrast, the mutant lacking the PRY/SPRY domain still retained RNA-binding ability.\n\nSurprisingly, the results from the proteome-wide analysis of RNA-binding domains in HeLa cells (Fig. 1b) , as well as the results obtained from the RNA pull-down ( Fig.1e) , EMSA (Fig. 1a,1c) , co-IP (Fig. 3) and RIP (Fig. 4f-4g) assays, implicate the All rights reserved.

This discrepancy could arise from the fact that deletion of the CC domain from TRIM25 eliminates its dimerization (Li et al., 2014; Sanchez et al., 2014; Streich et al., 2013) and oligomerization (Koliopoulos et al., 2016 ) ability (Fig. 2c) . While it is not univocally confirmed that TRIM25 needs to dimerize to bind RNA, such a phenomenon is widespread across many RNA-binding proteins (Feracci et al., 2016; Lunde et al., 2007) . Additionally, the experiments presented in Kwon et al. were performed in wild-type mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (mESC), where levels of endogenous TRIM25 are particularly high (Kwon et al., 2013) . This means that any ectopically overexpressed TRIM25 mutant (if it has the CC domain), including TRIM25\u0394PRY/SPRY, will have a chance to heterodimerize with the wild-type, endogenous TRIM25. This could mask the requirements for a TRIM25 domain, such as PRY/SPRY, to bind to RNA. Our RNA pull-down data with the extracts from the TRIM25 KO cells clearly demonstrated that T7-TRIM25\u0394PRY/SPRY could not bind RNA (Fig. 1g) . Further structural characterization of the TRIM25/RNA complex should reveal novel features of this interaction and shed more light on this novel, putative RNA-binding domain.\n\nImportantly, there are more than eighty TRIM proteins in the human genome (Versteeg et al., 2013) , and they have been divided into 11 subfamilies based on their structural composition;\n\nforty-three of them have PRY/SPRY domains (subfamilies C-I and C-IV). Although there is a high degree of similarity between them, only TRIM25 (from TRIM proteins containing PRY/SPRY) was identified in HeLa (Castello et al., 2012) and mESC (Kwon et al., 2013) screens for proteins that bind to RNAs. This could reflect a lack of saturation of RNA-capture screens or lack of expression of many other PRY/SPRY-containing TRIM proteins in the cell lines used for these assays. Interestingly, another protein from the TRIM family, TRIM71, was shown to use its NHL, but not its CC, domain to bind RNA (Kwon et al., 2013; Loedige All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.\n\nThe copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. (Fig. 7) . In this context TRIM5 was shown to generate K63 ubiquitin chains, which are required for restriction of retroviral reverse transcription (Fletcher et al., 2015) . Thus, in the future, it will be important to assay other TRIM proteins to determine their RNA-binding activities. Notably, other E3 ubiquitin ligases, including Mex3b and Dizip3, have been shown to use RNA as a scaffold to mediate the ubiquitination of their substrates, which are bound to the same RNA (Yoon et al., 2013) . Roquin is another example of an E3 ubiquitin ligase with a well-established RNA-binding ability (Leppek et al., 2013) . Moreover, the BRACA1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is implicated in familial breast cancer, has been shown to interact with RNAs (Kawai and Amano, 2012) . Altogether, these results strongly suggest the possibility of widespread roles of E3 ubiquitin ligases in the direct regulation of RNA metabolism.\n\nTRIM25 is involved in normal development and disease . For example, TRIM25 has been implicated in estrogen-dependent organ development (Inoue et al., 1993) .\n\nConsequently, TRIM25 knockout mice present significantly underdeveloped uteri (Orimo et al., 1995; Orimo et al., 1999) . Furthermore, TRIM25 plays a role in promoting proliferation of many cancer cell types, often in association with the estrogen response (Ikeda et al., 2000; Suzuki et al., 2005; Thomson et al., 2001; Urano et al., 2002) . Recently, TRIM25 has been shown to be a master regulator of breast cancer metastasis (Walsh et al., 2017) . Additionally, TRIM25 is known for its role in the Retinoic Acid-Inducible Gene 1 (RIG-I)-mediated interferon pathway (Ozato et al., 2008; Versteeg et al., 2013) . Upon detection of viral RNAs with 5'ppp-RNA, RIG-I activates a signaling cascade that results in phosphorylation-All rights reserved.

K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I by TRIM25 is required for an efficient interferon response (Gack et al., 2007) . RIG-I can also be stimulated by unanchored polyubiquitin chains generated by TRIM25 (Zeng et al., 2010) . This interaction is targeted by viruses to suppress the interferon response. For example, the influenza's RNA-binding protein NS1 inhibits TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I by binding to the TRIM25 CC domain and disrupting its dimerization, allowing the virus to avoid the innate immune response (Gack et al., 2009) . This inhibitory activity is significantly reduced in an NS1 mutant R38A/K41A, which cannot bind RNA (Donelan et al., 2003) . This raises questions about a possible functional link between the RNA-binding activities of TRIM25 and NS1. Finally, SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) has been shown to inhibit TRIM25 by binding to TRIM25's PRY/SPRY domain (Hu et al., 2017) .\n\nConsidering our results, it is plausible that N-protein could directly inhibit the TRIM25 RNA binding activity. To fully understand the RNA-related role of TRIM25 in development and disease, it will be important to characterize TRIM25/RNA complexes, especially in the context of RIG-I activation by viral RNAs.\n\nIn summary, we have presented the transcriptome and proteome-wide interactomes of a novel RNA-binding protein, TRIM25. We showed that the PRY/SPRY domain is responsible for the ability of TRIM25 to bind RNA. Finally, we have provided evidence that RNA is an important component in TRIM25's ubiquitin ligase activity. A recent genome-wide bioinformatics screen of the human proteome identified more than 2600 proteins with RNAbinding capacity (Ghosh and Sowdhamini, 2016) .

Binding reactions were performed in 16 \u03bc l reactions containing gel exclusion buffer (4.8 mM Tris pH 8, 144 mM NaCl, 0.96 mM DTT) supplemented with 3 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM ATP, and 37.5 mM creatine phosphate. Reactions were incubated at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, followed by electrophoresis on a 6% (w/v) non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The signal was recorded with radiographic film or as exposed to a phosphoimaging screen and scanned on a FLA-5100 scanner (Fujifilm).\n\nRNA pull-down assays were performed as previously described (Choudhury et al., 2013) , with slight modifications. In brief, total protein extracts were incubated with in vitro transcribed RNAs that were chemically coupled to beads (Michlewski and Caceres, 2010) .\n\nThe incubation was followed by a series of washes with buffer G (20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 135 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride).

As indicated, some samples were treated with RNases A and T1 prior to loading on the gel. For mass spectrometry, the T7-bound beads were incubated with HeLa extracts grown in Light or Heavy R6K4 (13C-labeled arginine and 2D-labeled lysine) isotopes (Dundee Cell Products LM014/16). Next, the bound proteins were run on a 4-12% SDS polyacrylamide gel followed by in-gel digestion as described previously (Choudhury et al., 2013) .

In brief, two P100 dishes per sample were transfected with plasmid expressing T7-tagged TRIM25. Anti-T7 antibody was coupled to 50 \u00b5l Dynabeads per sample. Following immunoprecipitation, the RNA was dephosphorylated, the 3' linker was ligated and radiolabeled and the 5' linker was ligated on the beads. The 3' linker reaction was performed in a total of 80 \u00b5l, with 1x PNK buffer, 1 \u00b5M 3' adapter (3' adapter in CLIP oligos), 800 U T4 RNA ligase 2 truncated K227Q, 80 U RNase out, and 10% PEG 8000.

TRIM25 binding motifs were analyzed using pyMotif and WebLogo on identified clusters. The distribution of TRIM25 CLIP clusters across the protein coding genes was performed using pyBinCollector. The correlation between the experiments was calculated by comparing the heights of the clusters in the three experiments. The correlation with total RNA abundance was performed by comparing the heights of the clusters common in all three experiments with the transcript abundance in the RNA-seq data derived from HeLa cells.\n\nThe RIP experiments were performed as in the CLIP-seq immunoprecipitations, except for cross-linking and RNase treatment. The bound RNAs were isolated by Trizol extraction, and RNAs were identified by qRT-PCR, using the SuperScript III Platinum SYBR Green One-\n\nStep qRT-PCR Kit (Life Technologies) following the manufacturer's instructions on a Roche 480 LightCycler.\n\nImmunoprecipitation was performed as described above. Following the final wash proteins bound to beads were incubated with Ube1, His-Ube2D3 and ubiquitin (UBPBio). 1 mg/ml Ube1, 2 mg/ml His-Ube2D3 and 50 mg/ml ubiquitin was used for TRIM25 autoubiquitination. 5 mg/ml Ube1, 10 mg/ml His-Ube2D3 and 250 mg/ml ubiquitin was used for ZAP ubiquitination. The reactions were carried out at 37C for 1 hour or as indicated and were stopped by addition of loading buffer and reducing agent.
