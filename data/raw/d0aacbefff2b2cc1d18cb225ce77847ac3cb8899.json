{"title": "", "body": "Pyrazoline is a five-membered ring heterocycle having two adjacent nitrogen atoms within the ring. It has only one endocyclic double bond and is of basic in nature [1] . They are also known as dihydropyrazoles and their chemistry are closely related to pyrazoles. According to heterocyclic nomenclature, pyrazolines require that the nitrogen atoms to be numbered 1 and 2 in each structure. There are three well-known tautomeric structures for pyrazolines namely: 1-pyrazoline, 2-pyrazoline and 3-pyrazoline ( Figure 1 ). However, among these tautomeric structures, 2-pyrazoline is the most common.\n\nPyrazoline derivatives are electron-rich nitrogenous heterocycles, which play an important role in the diverse biological activities. Among its derivatives, 3-substituted pyrazolines seem to be the most attractive pyrazoline-type derivatives [2] . These heterocyclic compounds are widely occurring in nature in the form of alkaloids, vitamins, pigments and as constituents of plant and animal cell.\n\nAccording to the X-ray analysis, pyrazoline ring has the structure of the five-membered dihydropyrazole ring and it has an envelope conformation [3] . The carbon atom at position-5 is deviated from the almost planar system of the other four atoms of the heterocyclic ring [4] . 2-Pyrazoline is insoluble in water but soluble in propylene glycol because of its lipophilic character [4] .\n\nDiversely substituted pyrazolines and their derivatives embedded with variety of functional groups are important biologically active agents and a huge amount of research activities have been directed toward this class of compounds. Pyrazoline derivatives are typical ICT (intramolecular charge transfer) compounds [5] , and are known as a kind of fluorescent brightening agents because they have strong blue fluorescence in solution.\n\nA classical synthesis of these compounds has been stimulated after the pioneering work of Fischer and Kn\u20ac oevenagel in the late 19th century [6] . The reaction of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones with hydrazines became one of the most popular methods for the preparation of 2-pyrazolines [7, 8] . In this method, hydrazones are formed as intermediates, which can be subsequently cyclized to 2-pyrazolines in the presence of a suitable cyclizing reagent like acetic acid. An alternative route involves 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of nitrileimines to carbon--carbon double bond of arylmethylene (arylidene derivatives of active methylene) compounds as well as acrylic and cinnamic acid derivatives [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The discovery of this class of compounds and considering their efficiency as drugs provides an outstanding case history of modern drug developments and also points out the unpredictability of pharmacological activity from structural modification of a prototype drug molecule. In general, pyrazoline derivatives display a broad spectrum of potential pharmacological activities and have wide medical applications.\n\n2. Pyrazoline patents 2.1 Overview of patent activity In the last decade, a significant interest of research in heterocyclic chemistry has been directed to substituted 2-pyrazoline derivatives. Section 2.2 of this review focuses on the recent development on pyrazolines along with their biological properties in both regular literature and patents field. Recently, some important reviews have been published on pyrazoline compounds [16, 17] .\n\nThe present review casts light on the recent patents and literature that is directed toward the therapeutic applications of pyr- 2.2 Biological and therapeutic applications of pyrazolines 2.2.1 Cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonists One of the most attractive subjects of intensive research on pyrazoline derivatives is cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) antagonists due to their highly fruitful therapeutic features. CB1 receptor antagonists have good prospects in many therapeutic areas, such as smoking and alcohol addiction as well as cognitive impairment. Recently, new chemical entities (NCEs) with CB1 antagonistic properties, structurally related to rimonabant 1, have been disclosed by some academic research groups and several pharmaceutical companies as well. There are a considerable number of CB1 antagonists that are bioisosteres and derived from rimonabant (1) by replacement of the pyrazole moiety with other heterocyclic analogs like pyrazoline.\n\nRecently, Marti et al. reported one-pot preparation of cinchonidine salt of (4S,5S)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (2), which is useful as an intermediate in the preparation of cannabinoid CB1 neutral antagonists. The method is efficient to avoid isolation of intermediates and produces product in good yield and enantiomeric excess [18] .\n\n. Pyrazoline heterocycle provides a structural core for building huge variety of biologically active compounds. . The pharmacological activity of pyrazolinebased compounds extends from central nervous system (CNS) applications to antimicrobials. . The most predominant pharmacological activity was observed for the class of 'antimicrobials'. . Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) pyrazoline modulators are very useful in treatment of obesity and schizophrenia. . Pyrazoline-containing cytotoxic compounds are not only useful in treatment of cancer, but also some of them act as cancer chemopreventive agents. . There are many reports centered on the antimycobaterium activity of pyrazoline-containing compounds, most of them have been assayed versus the vaccine-strain H37Rv.\n\nThis box summarizes key points contained in the article.

Several 3-(3-acetoamino)phenyl-1,5-substituted phenyl-2-pyrazolines 51 --53 were synthesized by Singh et al. [61] and evaluated for their anticonvulsant activity. The synthesized pyrazolines 51 --53 exhibited anticonvulsant activity, which was reflected by 60 --80% protection observed versus PTZ-induced seizures. Those compounds exhibit their anticonvulsant potentials via inhibiting oxidation of certain nicotinamide--adenine--dinucleotide substrates.\n\nA set of pyrazoline derivatives have been prepared by Shishikura et al.

From the structure--activity relationship (SAR) point of view, it was found that 4-methoxy and 4-chloro substituents on the phenyl ring at position-3 of the pyrazoline ring increased the antidepressant activity. Replacement of these groups by bromo and methyl substituents has negative impacts on the antidepressant properties.\n\nPrasad et al. [65] synthesized some 1,3,5-triphenyl-2-pyrazolines having the general formula 59 \n\nRecent advances in the therapeutic applications of pyrazolines 3-(2\u00a2\u00a2-hydroxynaphthalen-1\u00a2\u00a2-yl)-1,5-diphenyl-2-pyrazolines 60 and evaluated their antidepressant activity. The pyrazoline derivative 61 was found to reduce the immobility times by 25 --59% at 100 mg/kg dose level.

The ability of the prepared derivatives to induce gastric toxicity was also evaluated. Most of the prepared series showed significant anti-inflammatory activity, with higher safety margins than indomethacin in regard to gastric toxicity. When NO-donating group was incorporated into the parent pyrazoline derivatives, they caused a non-significant reduction in the anti-inflammatory activity and a marked decrease in gastric ulcerations induced by pyrazolines that lack the same group.\n\nPyrazoline derivatives containing benzoxazole and benzimidazole moiety 81 have been reported by Kaplancikli et al.

These pyrazolines were found to have a significant antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria and possessed appreciable analgesic activity.\n\nStirrett et al. [112] synthesized some pyrazolines represented by compound 101 with structural similarities to siderophores and evaluated their ability as novel antimicrobials against M. tuberculosis and Yersinia pestis.\n\n1,3,5-Trisubstituted-2-pyrazolines 102 were reported by Shenoy et al. [113] and were tested for their antimicrobial activity. Some of the compounds exhibited potential antitubercular activity.\n\nZampieri et al. [118] reported the synthesis of 1-(3,5-diaryl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1H-imidazole derivatives 103 and tested them against strains of C. albicans and a strain of M. tuberculosis H37Rv.\n\nShaharyar et al. presented a series of N1-nicotinoyl-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methylphenyl)-5-(substituted phenyl)-2-pyrazolines 104 and tested them in vitro for their antimycobacterial activity. Some of these pyrazolines were found to be an active agent against different strains of TB, with MIC value of 0.26 \u00b5M [114] . 5-Aryl-1-isonicotinoyl-3-(pyridin-2-yl)-4,5-dihydro-1Hpyrazole derivatives 105 have been synthesized by Mamolo et al. [115] and tested for their in vitro antimycobacterial activity. The latter pyrazoline derivative showed an interesting activity against different strains of M. tuberculosis.\n\nSeveral 1-[(N,N-disubstituted thiocarbamoylthio)acetyl]-3-(2-thienyl)-5-aryl-2-pyrazoline derivatives 106 were synthesizes by Ozdemir et al. [116] and Shaharyar et al. [114] and evaluated for their in vitro antimycobacterial activity against H37Rv strain.\n\nThe potential benefits of medicaments endowed with both antimycobacterial and antifungal characters represent a valuable goal, since the association between TB and mycotic infections often occurs in immunocompromised patients [117] . So far, some 1,3,5-triryl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazoles, as represented by structure 107, pendent to 1H-imidazole ring have been reported by Zampieri et al. [118] and tested for their in vitro antifungal and antimycobacterial activities. These imidazole-substituted pyrazole derivatives showed significant antifungal activity against a clinical strain of C. albicans and remarkable antitubercular activity against M. tuberculosis H37Rv.\n\nA series of heterocyclic-substituted diphenyl ether derivatives of pyrazoles 108 have been synthesized and evaluated for their activity against H37Rv strain of Mycobacterium. Ten compounds inhibited the growth at concentrations as low as 1 \u00b5g/ml. This level of activity was found comparable with the reference drugs rifampicin and isoniazid at the same concentration [119] .\n\nAnother series of 5-(4-(substituted)phenyl)-3-(4-hydroxy-3-methylphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-1-pyrazolyl-2-toluidinomethanethione and 5-(substituted)phenyl-3-(4-hydroxy-3methylphenyl)-4,5-dihydro-1H-1-pyrazolyl-2-methoxyanilino methanethione derivatives were synthesized by Ali et al. [120] and tested for their in vitro antitubercular activity against M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Compound 109 was found to be the most active with MIC value of 0.0034 \u00b5M [120] .\n\nBabu et al. [121] evaluated the biological activity of 1,3,5-trisubstituted pyrazolines-bearing benzofuran moiety 110a and 110b. These compounds have been found to have some antitubercular effect. [122] . The results showed that these compounds exhibited promising antiamoebic activity (IC 50 = 0.05, 0.31, 0.06 and 0.29 \u00b5M, respectively) [122] . A variety of 3-(3-bromophenyl)-5-phenyl-1-(thiazolo[4,5-b] quinoxaline-2-yl)-2-pyrazoline derivative, as represented by compound 112, have been achieved by Budakoti et al. [123] , and screened for their antiamoebic activity against HMI: IMSS strain of E. histolytica by micro-dilution method which compared the IC 50 values with the standard drug metronidazole [123] . Also, the same authors have synthesized a novel Pd (II) complexes with 1-N-substituted thiocarbamoyl-3,5-diphenyl-2-pyrazoline (Budakoti et al. [124] ) and evaluated their antiamoebic activity by micro-dilution method against HM1:IMSS strain of E. histolytica and compared the results with the standard drug metronidazole. These palladium complexes showed better activity than their corresponding ligands. The pyrazoline 113a showed better inhibitory [124] . Similarly, Husain et al. reported another series of Pd(II) complexes, represented below by the most active compound 113b [125] . But this series of compounds were less active than 113a in terms of IC 50 values; however, complex 113b (IC 50 = 0.37 \u00b5M) is more active than metronidazole [125] .\n\nAbid et al. [126, 127] synthesized a series of 1-N-substituted thiocarbamoyl-3-phenyl-2-pyrazoline derivatives 114 by cyclization of Mannich bases with thiosemicarbazide and evaluated their in vitro antiamoebic activities against E. histolytica in comparison with metronidazole as reference drug. The preliminary SARs indicated that the substitution of 3-chloro or 3-bromo on the phenyl ring at pyrazoline position-3 markedly enhanced the antiamoebic activity. Moreover, compound 115 showed the most promising antiamoebic activity with an IC 50 value of 0.6 versus 1.8 \u00b5M of metronidazole.\n\nAnother new series of pyrazoline derivatives were synthesized by cyclization of Mannich bases with thiosemicarbazides being substituted by different cyclic and aromatic amines and screened for in vitro antiamoebic activity against E. histolytica. The pyrazoline 116 was found to be the most active compound in this series [126] . The Pd(II) complexes of these derivatives have been also prepared and evaluated for their antiamoebic activity [128] . As observed previously, the Pd(II) complexes exhibited stronger antiamoebic activity [128] . Bhat et al. reported some interesting bis-pyrazolines 117 prepared by cyclization of chalcones with N-4-substituted thiosemicarbazides under basic conditions. Investigation of the antiamoebic activity showed that compounds with aromatic substituents at the thiocarbamoyl group were more active than those with the cyclic groups [129] .\n\nSemicarbazone-based pyrazoline derivatives, represented by compound 118, have been designed as drug candidates for Chagas' disease (American trypanosomiasis) [130] . Compound 118 showed inhibitory activity versus Trypanosoma cruzi as low as 80 nM. Compound 118 and its analogs exhibited their antitrypanosomal activities by targeting cysteine protease cruzain, interestingly, with low cellular toxicity [130] . \n\nSome new N-acetyl and N-thiocarbamoyl derivatives of 4,5-dihydropyrazoles were synthesized by El-Sabbagh et al. and were tested against a broad panel of viruses in different cell cultures [132] . N-Acetyl-4,5-dihydropyrazole was the only active compound at sub-toxic concentrations against vaccinia virus (Lederle strain) in HEL cell cultures with an EC 50 value of 7 \u00b5g/ml [132] .\n\nYar et al. reported the synthesis of new pyrazolines derived from phenoxyacetic acid. The synthesized derivatives were tested for their in vitro cytotoxicity and antiviral activity. In addition to the antiviral activity of 2-{4-[3-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-1-(2-hydroxybenzoyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-5-pyrazolyl]-2-methoxyphenoxy}acetic acid (120) , it showed the maximum cytotoxicity of the series [133] [134] [135] .\n\nA series of trisubstituted pyrazolines 121a and 121b showed an inhibition for flavivirus infection in cell culture and was identified through high-throughput screening of a compound library using a luciferase-expressing West Nile virus (WNV) infection assay [136] . The aryl-rings in such pyrazolines are essential for the activity against WNV. The pyrazolines inhibitors of RNA synthesis that were investigated pointed the viral RNA polymerase, RNA helicase or other viral replication enzymes as potential targets [137] .\n\nLiang et al. [138] reported the synthesis of the 3,5-diaryl-4,5-dihydropyrazole derivatives 122, which inhibits the activity of picornavirus and coronavirus simultaneously. These compounds could be used for preventing and treating diseases caused by pecorino virus and coronavirus, such as influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, aseptic meningitis, myocarditis, hepatitis A and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n\nSilver and Soderlund [139] synthesized some insecticides that are related to the pyrazolines 123a and 123b and examined their mechanism of action based on electrophysiological, pharmacological and toxicological information. Eventually, it was found that these compounds exert their insecticidal activity via neuronal targets [139] .\n\nTuran-Zitouni et al. [140] synthesized several 1-(4-arylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diaryl-2-pyrazolines 124 and studied their hypotensive activity by the tail-cuff method. All the synthesized pyrazolines showed appreciable hypotensive activities comparable with clonidine as a reference drug.\n\nA series of 3-(3,5-dialkyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-5-(multi-substituted-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-pyrazolines were prepared and evaluated their inhibitory action on acyl-coenzyme A cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), which is responsible for formation of cholesterol precursor acetoacetyl CoA in the mevalonate pathway [141] . The pyrazoline 125 as an example of this series showed in vitro inhibitory activity on hACAT-1 and -2 [142] .\n\nSubstituted pyrazoline derivatives of the general formula 126 with ACAT inhibition activity were prepared and their pharmaceutical compositions and uses in the treatment of dyslipidemia have been reported by Yenes-Minguez and Torrens-Jover [134, 143] . \n\nA novel series of pyrazoline derivatives have been synthesized by Babu et al. [146] and evaluated for their antioxidant activity at various concentrations against standard ascorbic acid. The pyrazoline 132 among the series of the synthesized compounds showed excellent antioxidant activity as compared with ascorbic acid.\n\nZhang et al. designed several pyrazolines of the general formula 133 and evaluated them by in vivo screening as tissue selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs). SARs were investigated at the R 1 to R 6 positions as well as the core pyrazoline ring and the anilide linker. It was found that, strong electron-withdrawing groups at the R 1 and R 2 positions and small groups at the R 5 and R 6 positions were optimal for androgen receptor agonist activity [147] . Jones et al. achieved the synthesis of 4-substituted pyrazoline derivatives 134 and studied their docking into a protein receptor homology model. The results of the study revealed that the synthesized compounds exhibited functional antagonism of protein receptor [148] .\n\nA series of interesting androstano[17,16-c]pyrazolines and their oxidized derivatives 135 have been synthesized and evaluated for their anti-androgenic activity compared with that of cyproterone as a positive control. Some of these compounds showed better anti-androgenic activity than the reference drug [149] .\n\nFisas-Escasany et al. [150, 151] achieved preparation of substituted pyrazolines 136 in order to be used in combination therapy with other antidiabetic agents.\n\nThe human urotensin II receptor (h-UTR) is a member of the family of rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in the modulation of the functionality of many tissues and organs. A combinatorial scaffold approach has been reported by Olsson [152] to build a library of compounds having four diversity points. The synthesized compounds provide the mapping of urotensin II and somatostatin-5 receptors by differential binding of the receptors.\n\nFrom the aforementioned examples, pyrazoline heterocyclic ring was mainly used as a structural core for building huge variety of biologically active compounds. The versatile pyrazoline structure with semi-saturated status provides a unique spatial configuration which allows various substitution patterns. Figure 3 shows eight possible patterns of only two substitutions. One can imagine the diversity in cases of three or more substituents.\n\nAmong the reported activities, there are some important notes; pyrazoline-containing cytotoxic compounds are not only useful in treatment of various cancer types, but also some of them act as cancer chemopreventive agents. Concerning the reported antimycobaterium activity of pyrazoline-containing compounds, all reports have been assayed utilizing the vaccine-strain H37Rv and not the infectious strains, which make the biological impacts doubtful. Evaluating those compounds versus multidrugresistant (MR-TB) or extreme drug-resistant (XDR-TB) mycobacterium strains will add huge value to the present work.\n\nThe reported articles are hampered by lacking molecular target identification. Most of the reported biological activities for pyrazoline-containing compounds were based on cellbased assays, and the authors have not reported anything about the possible molecular target. So far, these kinds of drug development protocols do not allow conducting structure-based drug design approaches. From our point of view, more attention has to be given for the molecular basis of mode of actions. Hence, rational drug design methods could be applied and more drug-like candidates will likely be obtained.\n\nThe authors state no conflict of interest and have received no payment in preparation of this manuscript.\n\nPapers of special note have been highlighted as either of interest () or of considerable interest () to readers. 28.
