{"title": "Comparative Epidemiology of Human Infections with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses among Healthcare Personnel", "body": "Ten years after the outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) occurred in 29 countries, another novel coronavirus named Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first found in the Middle East, in 2012 [1, 2]. The novel coronaviruses responsible for both SARS and MERS infections are zoonotic viruses. Civet cats and bats were identified as the sources of SARS-CoV infections in humans, whereas camels and bats were associated with human MERS-CoV infections [3\u20135]. Both viruses spread to an intermediate mammalian host from which humans are infected. Although human-to-human transmission occurred, this was mainly within households and medical care facilities, where healthcare personnel (HCP) were affected the most. However, super spreading events were reported in the SARS and MERS outbreak [6, 7].\n\nPrevious studies also indicated that HCP were a major high-risk population for infections with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [8, 9], but the information was very fragmented. Here, based on a series of HCP laboratory-confirmed MERS and SARS infections obtained from the World Health Organization and Taiwan, respectively, we compared the epidemiological and clinical characteristics, and particular similarities as well as differences between the two coronavirus infections to measure the risks related to fatal outcomes in both HCP and total cases. These data will be of benefit for effective prevention and control for any future nosocomial outbreaks of novel Coronavirus, and will therefore promote occupational health.\n\nAll the laboratory-confirmed MERS cases were obtained from various publicly available sources from April 1 of 2012 to July 7 of 2015, including the published literature and data reported to the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/) (S1 Table). All laboratory-confirmed SARS cases were reported to the WHO from Taiwan during November 1 of 2002 to December 31, 2003 (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/), after the final decision by the SARS Advisory Committee members in Taiwan (S2 Table).\n\nAccording to the WHO guideline, a laboratory-confirmed case with MERS-CoV was defined as as either detection of viral nucleic acid or confirmation by serology [10].Based on the WHO guideline, the case definitions for SARS cases were confirmed by several different laboratory tests, including confirmation of the RT-PCR results from two different laboratories or two different specimens collected from the same person, and/or serological tests by ELISA.\n\nOnce cases were suspected to be clinical SARS cases, preliminary investigation was conducted using a standardized questionnaire about demographic characteristics and exposure history, clinical features, and laboratory results. Respiratory samples obtained from any reported suspected SARS cases were sent to the Center for Disease Control in Taiwan (Taiwan-CDC) for confirmation by RT-PCR or serology. The details of all the laboratory methods (molecular RT-PCR or serological tests) to confirm SARS-CoV were as previously described [11].\n\nRegional incidence rates are shown on the map using the bio-geographical information system software ArcGIS Map10.2 (http://resources.arcgis.com/en/home/). We used the ggplot function from the R package \u201cggplot2\u201d to draw the boxplots of age distribution between MERS and SARS cases.\n\nQuantitative measurements are presented as the mean and range of the observed values, and qualitative measurements are presented as relative and absolute frequencies. Categorical and continuous characteristics were analyzed with a chi-squared test and t test, respectively. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Any p values given are two-sided and subject to a local significance level of 0.05.\n\nAs of 7 July 2015, 1368 laboratory-confirmed human MERS-CoV cases had been reported to the WHO, 487 of whom died (35.6%). All of these MERS cases were distributed in 26 countries, particularly predominant in the Arabian Peninsula and South Korea. However, global MERS-HCP cases occurred in 6 countries; see Table 1\nand Fig 1. MER-HCP accounted for 13.37% (183/1368) of overall MERS cases in the world.\n\nBy contrast, as of 31 December 2003, 8096 laboratory-confirmed global human SARS-CoV cases had been reported to the WHO, 774 of whom died (9.6%). These SARS cases were distributed in 29 countries, particularly predominant in Asian areas. The percent of the SARS-HCP in total cases was higher than the percent of the MERS-HCP [21.07% (1706/8096) vs 13.37% (183/1368), p<0.001]. The CFR in overall MERS was statistically significantly higher than that of overall SARS [35.6% (487/1368) vs 9.6% (774/8096), p<0.001]. (Table 1 and Fig 2).\n\nThe mean age in worldwide total 174 MERS cases was 49 years (range: 2~90 years), of which 143 MERS-HCP cases were aged 40 years (range: 24~74 years), significantly younger than in 31 MERS-non-HCP cases [47.5 years (range: 2~90 years), p = 0.035]. Similarly, the mean age in 347 total Taiwan SARS cases was 42 years (range: 0~94), of which the mean age in 98 SARS-HCP cases was 35 years (range: 21~68 years), also much younger than that of SARS-non-HCP [45 years (range: 0~94 years), p = 0.044]. Noticeably, the mean ages of MERS-HCP and total MERS cases were significantly older than those for SARS-HCP (p = 0.006) and total SARS cases in Taiwan (p = 0.0002). (Fig 3A and 3B and Table 1). We stratified the age groups between the MERS-HCP and SARS-HCP cases; the results show that there are no signature differences in the mean age of the 20~, 30~, 40~, 50~, 60\u201370 groups between the two groups.\n\nIn terms of sex distribution, among MERS cases whose gender information was available, 65% of 1359 total MERS cases were male, of which 54.46% of 101 MERS-HCP and 69.55% of 1258 MERS-non-HCP [p = 0.002] were male respectively. However, in Taiwan females were dominant in the 98 SARS-HCP cases (82.65%, 81/98) and 249 SARS-non-HCP cases (55.0%, 137/249) [p = 0.027], while males accounted for 46.93% (3778/8050) of total global SARS cases. (Fig 3A and 3B and Table 1). We stratified the gender groups between the MERS-HCP and SARS-HCP cases, with the results showing significant differences in the gender distribution of the 20~, 30~, 40~, 50~, 60\u201370 groups between the two groups.\n\nRegarding the working departments of HCP, 58.82% (10/17) of MERS-HCP cases worked in an intensive care unit (ICU), while 17.65% (3/17), 11.76% (2/17), and 11.76% (2/17) worked in Emergency rooms (ER), internal medicine and other departments in hospitals, respectively. Among the 57 of 98 SARS-HCP cases with their information of working departments available, ER (31.58%, 18/57), wards of internal medicine (26.31%, 15/57), and ICU (10.53%, 6/57) and other wards (31.58%, 18/57) were the four major working sites (Table 1). Our statistics for department will be heavily biased because of the missing department information in the HCP infections with MERS and SARS-CoV.\n\nAmong total 169 hospital-acquired MERS cases, patients accounted for 46.2%, family members or visitors 34.9%, and HCP (19.0%). Among the 227 laboratory-confirmed SARS cases from hospital infections, HCP accounted the highest (43.2%), followed by patients (28.6%), family members or visitors (19.8%), foreign caregivers (4.4%), and others (4.0%). Nurses were the major populations in both groups (Fig 4A and 4B).\n\nThe percentages of asymptomatic cases [36.72% (47/128) vs 17.39% (16/92), p = 0.001] and mild cases [43.75% (56/128) vs 18.48% (17/92), p <0.001] in HCP were much higher than those in non-HCP. However, the percentage of severe MERS cases in HCP was significantly lower than that in non-HCP [12.5% (16/128) vs 27.17% (25/92), p = 0.006)]. Similarly, CFR of MERS-HCP was statistically lower than that in MERS-non-HCP [(7.0% (9/128) vs 36.96% (34/92), p<0.001] Table 2. By contrast, severe SARS cases were more common in HCP than in non-HCP [86.76% (86/98) vs 75.50% (188/249), p = 0.012]. Nonetheless, CFR of SARS in HCP was significantly lower than that in non-HCP [12.24% (12/98) vs.24.50% (61/249), p = 0.012, Table 2]. In general, MERS-HCP were predominantly associated with mild cases whereas SARS-HCP were more likely to develop severe cases. On the other hand, MERS-non-HCP cases had higher CFR than SARS-non-HCP cases [36.96% (34/92) vs 24.50% (61/249), p = 0.023, Table 2.\n\nDetailed investigations on clinical manifestations of these two infections in HCP and non-HCP demonstrated that cough was the most frequent symptom in MERS-HCP [63.41% (81/128)], whereas fever was the most common symptom in MERS-non-HCP [97.83% (90/92)]. Additionally, both diarrhea and shortness of breath (SOB) were higher in the MERS-non-HCP compared to the MERS-HCP [26.00% (24/92) vs 2.44% (3/128), p<0.001; 73.91% (68/92) vs 48.78% (62/128), p<0.001, respectively] (Table 2).\n\nThree time periods useful for public health surveillance were evaluated (Table 2). In MERS groups, the incubation period (the days from exposure to the clinical presentations) showed no differences between MERS-HCP and MERS-non-HCP [7 (3~11) vs 5 (2.0~15), p = 0.150] or between SARS-HCP and SARS-non-HCP cases [6 (1~15) vs 5 (4~6), p = 0.250]. The days from onset to being discharged and to death between the two groups also revealed similar results. By contrast, MERS-HCP cases had significantly shorter days from onset to laboratory-confirmation than MERS-non-HCP [6 (1~14) vs 10 (1~21), p = 0.044].\n\nIn SARS groups, among the three measures, only the days from onset to being discharged showed a difference, with significantly shorter days for SARS-HCP than SARS-non-HCP [19 (2~92) vs 24 (0\u201374), p = 0.002]. Table 2\n\nAmong the HCP with SARS and MERS infections, MERS-HCP had significantly longer days from onset to admission than SARS-HCP [5 (0~11) vs 3 (0~14), p = 0.010] but a shorter period from onset to being discharged [11 (5~24) vs 24 (0~74), p = 0.010)] and to death [13 (4~17) vs 14.5 (0~52), p = 0.045] and be hospitalized days [9.5 (3~22) vs 22 (0~69), p = 0.040] in MERS-HCP than those in SARS-HCP. Table 2\n\nTo minimize the case fatality rate in MERS-HCP and SARS-HCP, we analyzed the epidemiology about the deaths related to HCP infections. 10 fatal MERS-HCP cases from Saudi Arabia, UAE and Jordan, as well as 13 fatal SARS-HCP cases in Taiwan were included (Table 3). The mean age of fatal MERS-HCP cases was 50 (26~67), 70% of them were male, and 40% (4/10) had comorbidities. Similarly, the mean age of the fatal SARS-HCP cases was 49 (28~68), 64.29% of whom were female. 69.23% (9/13) of SARS-HCP cases had accompanying co-morbidities. We found that fatality was most often found in age 50~ groups with co-mortality in both the MERS-HCP and SARS-HCP groups respectively. Most of the fatal SARS-HCP were hired care workers (30.77% (; 4/13), or cleaners or nurses (15.38% (; 2/13). Importantly, the mean age in fatal HCP with the two infections was much older than in survivors of HCP with these infections.\n\nThe MERS data were obtained from publicly available data sources. Since SARS was a legally required notifiable disease in Taiwan in 2003, the data of SARS cases were centralized as a data bank for group data analysis only. All these data were provided and analyzed in an anonymous format, without access to personally identifying information."}
