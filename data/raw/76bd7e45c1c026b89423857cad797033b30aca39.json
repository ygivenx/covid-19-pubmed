{"title": "Early Introduction and Delayed Dissemination of Pandemic Influenza, Gabon", "body": "Surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) was performed during July 2009-June 2011 in the capital city of Gabon, Libreville, and in 3 other towns in rural Gabon (Franceville, Oyem, and Koulamoutou) ( Figure 1 ). ILI was defined as fever (>38\u00b0C) and runny nose, cough, or sore throat. Study participants were enrolled at 3 health care centers in Libreville and at the regional hospitals in the other towns; all patients who visited these health centers for ILI were systematically sampled. Individual oral consent was obtained from patients for nasal sampling.\n\nEpidemiologic data (name, age, sex, and travel history during the month before onset) and clinical data were collected for each patient. Nasal swabs were sent each week to Centre International de Recherches M\u00e9dicales de Franceville for analysis. Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was used to detect pH1N1, seasonal influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), and seasonal influenza B viruses (12) . Specimens positive for pH1N1 virus were also tested by specific quantitative PCR for the following common respiratory viruses: adenovirus, (Table) . Median patient age was 1.66 years (range 10 days-82 years); 81% of these patients were <4 years of age, and 19% were 4-82 years of age. The M:F sex ratio was 1.02. The number of cases of ILI increased during the 2 rainy seasons and decreased during the 2 dry seasons ( Figure  2 ), which is consistent with a study showing an increase of the number of influenza cases during the rainy seasons in Senegal (13) .\n\nAmong the 966 cases of ILI, 131 (13.6%) were determined to be caused by an influenza virus: 72 (55%) pH1N1, 8 (6%) seasonal influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), and 51 (39%) influenza B (Table; Figure 2 ). No deaths caused by pH1N1 were reported during the study period. For the 72 patients infected with pH1N1 virus, median age was 2 years (range 2 months-49 years); 76.4% of these patients were <4 years of age, and 23.6% were 4-49 years of age. The M:F sex ratio was 0.85.\n\nOnly 18 patients with pH1N1 harbored another respiratory virus; this finding suggests that pH1N1 virus infection was responsible for the symptoms in all pH1N1 virus-infected patients. Among patients with pH1N1, we found co-infections with PIV1 (n = 1), PIV3 (n = 2), PIV4 (n = 1), HCoV 229E (n = 1), HCoV OC43 (n = 1), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 7), and adenovirus (n = 5).\n\nThe first laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 case (case 1), in a tourist who resided in the Reunion Islands, was diagnosed on July 26, 2009 (Figure 2, panel A) . On his trip to Gabon, he had made changeovers in Mauritius and South Africa, 2 countries heavily affected by pH1N1. The patient's symptoms lasted \u22481 week. The second laboratoryconfirmed case (case 2) was detected in Franceville 4 months later, during the short rainy season (Figure 2 , panels A, E). ILI developed in this patient 3 days after his arrival in Franceville from France, which was also heavily affected by pH1N1 during this time.\n\nThe first 2 autochthonous cases were diagnosed on November 26, 2009 (cases 3), 1 week after the second imported case of pH1N1, during the short rainy season. Subsequently, 29 autochthonous cases were detected in Libreville, 17 in Oyem, 17 in Koulamoutou, and 7 in Franceville (Table) . Libreville was the first town with detected pH1N1 cases during the rainy season and also had the highest number of pH1N1 cases (Table) . The first autochthonous case was detected in Oyem in early June 2010; during the 2010 short rainy season, several pH1N1 cases were detected in Oyem, indicating pH1N1 virus dissemination throughout Gabon by that time. A total of 85% of the influenza cases in Oyem were pH1N1 (Table) . A similar pattern of pH1N1 was observed in Koulamoutou and Franceville during the short rainy season (Figure 2 , panels D, E). The percentage of pH1N1 among all influenza cases in Franceville increased from 3% in 2010 to 60% in 2011 (Table) . We detected no cases of influenza, including pH1N1, in the provinces of Oyem and Koulamoutou during the first half of 2010.\n\nSeasonal influenza A was diagnosed in Gabon only during September-December 2009: 6 cases in Libreville, 1 case in Oyem, and 1 case in Franceville. During the short rainy season in 2010, the incidence of influenza B increased: 8 cases in Libreville, 2 cases in Oyem, 3 cases in Koulamoutou, and 38 cases in Franceville (Figure 2 ; Table) . We detected no cases of co-infection with pH1N1 virus and either seasonal influenza A or influenza B viruses.\n\nOur data suggest that pH1N1 virus was introduced in Gabon just before July 2009, during the first pandemic peak in the Americas and Europe. However, this early introduction did not result in continuous virus circulation in the rest of the country until the short rainy season in 2010. Only during the 2011 season was there a noteworthy increase in case numbers compatible with a pandemic wave, suggesting a notable time lag relative to that for other countries. Our findings indicate that rural tropical countries such as Gabon may serve as reservoirs for later spread of pH1N1 virus within the country and into other countries (14, 15 "}
