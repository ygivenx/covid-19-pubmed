{"title": "Single-dose treatment with a humanized neutralizing antibody affords\nfull protection of a human transgenic mouse model from lethal Middle East\nrespiratory syndrome (MERS)-coronavirus infection", "body": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), first isolated from\na Saudi Arabian patient in September 2012 (Zaki et\nal., 2012), causes human infection in other parts of the world and thus\nhas become a global concern. In particular, an outbreak in South Korea in 2015\nresulted in 186 infections with 36 deaths (http://www.who.int/csr/don/21-july-2015-mers-korea/en/). As of March\n16, 2016, a total of 1,690 laboratory-confirmed cases including over 600 deaths have\nbeen reported (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/), representing a\nmortality rate of 36%. The symptoms caused by MERS-CoV are similar to those\nfrom severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a related coronavirus\nwith a 10% fatality rate that led to the 2002\u20132003 epidemic (Skowronski et al., 2004; Zhong et al., 2003). Unlike SARS-CoV, for which no additional\ncases have been reported since 2005 (Du et al.,\n2009), MERS-CoV has shown continually increasing numbers of cases,\nparticularly in Saudi Arabia, suggesting its potential future epidemic status.\nNevertheless, no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral therapeutics are\ncurrently available, highlighting the urgent need of potent strategies to combat\nthis virus.\n\nMERS-CoV belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus of the\ncoronavirus family (de Groot et al., 2013;\nZaki et al., 2012). Its spike protein,\nconsisting of S1 and S2 subunits, plays important roles in viral entry into host\ncells (Bonavia et al., 2003; Gao et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2004). MERS-CoV depends on the receptor-binding\ndomain (RBD) in the S1 subunit to bind to its viral receptor, human dipeptidyl\npeptidase 4 (hDPP4), on the host cell surface, following which the S2 subunit\nundergoes a dramatic conformational change to allow for membrane fusion and\nsubsequent MERS-CoV penetration into the cellular membrane (Gao et al., 2013; Lu et al.,\n2013; Raj et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013). Therefore, the entry of\nMERS-CoV into target cells might be prevented by either blocking RBD/DPP4 viral\nreceptor binding or by inhibiting MERS-CoV/host cell membrane fusion.\n\nVaccines and passive therapeutics are effective approaches against viral\ninfections. In general, vaccines cannot provide immediate prophylactic protection\nagainst or treatment of ongoing viral infection. In comparison, passive therapeutics\nbased on neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has emerged as a powerful tool to\nprovide prophylactic and therapeutic protection against viral infection (Du et al., 2013a; Zhu et al., 2013). Several human or humanized\nviral-neutralizing mAbs have been developed, almost all of which target the RBD\n(Corti et al., 2015; Jiang et al., 2014; Li et al.,\n2015; Pascal et al., 2015; Tang et al., 2014; Ying et al., 2014; Yu et al.,\n2015), further suggesting that MERS-CoV RBD represents an ideal target\nfor neutralizing mAb development.\n\nWe previously developed a murine mAb, Mersmab1, that targets MERS-CoV RBD and\npotently neutralizes MERS-CoV infection (Du et al.,\n2014). Here, we humanized Mersmab1 and generated a humanized mAb, hMS-1,\nwhich exhibited high affinity RBD binding. We first investigated the activity as\nwell as the mechanism of hMS-1 in neutralizing MERS-CoV cell entry. Second, we\nevaluated its ability to neutralize emergent MERS-CoV strains. Finally, we\ndemonstrated that single-dose treatment with hMS-1 was able to elicit full\nprotection against lethal MERS-CoV infection in an hDPP4 transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mouse\nmodel. Of note, hMS-1 represents the first mAb reported to exhibit this capacity to\nprotect treated animals from the lethal infection of MERS-CoV.\n\nAnimal studies were performed in strict accordance with the\nrecommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The\nanimal protocol was approved by the IACUC of the Laboratory Animal Center, State\nKey Laboratory of Pathogen and Biosecurity, Beijing Institute of Microbiology\nand Epidemiology (Permit number, BIME 2015-0023). All procedures involving\nMERS-CoV were carried out in an approved biosafety level 3 facility.\n\nMERS-CoV RBD proteins were prepared as previously described (Ma et al., 2014). Briefly, MERS-CoV RBDs\n(GenBank accession no. AFS88936.1, residues 377\u2013588 of the spike\nprotein) fused with a C-terminal human Fc or His6 tag were\ntransiently expressed in a 293T cell culture system and purified using HiTrap\nProtein A FF (Fc-fused proteins) or HisTrap HP (His6-tagged proteins)\n(GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). Mutant RBD proteins were generated by\nsite-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis and confirmed by\nsequencing analysis. Mutant RBDs containing a C-terminal His6 tag\nwere transiently expressed in 293T cell supernatants and purified by HisTrap HP\nas described above.\n\nThe hMS-1 mAb was generated by humanizing the murine mAb Mersmab1 using a\npreviously described protocol (Boulianne et al.,\n1984). Briefly, total RNA was isolated from the Mersmab1 hybridoma\ncells and used to synthesize cDNA. Primers mVH-f (5\u2032 ATG GRA TGG AGC TGG\nATC TT 3\u2032) and mVH-r (5\u2032 ATA GAC AGA TGG GGG TGT CGT TTT GGC\n3\u2032) were used to amplify the variable region of the heavy chain\n(VH) gene, and mVK-f (5\u2032 ATG GAGWCA\nGAC ACA CTC CT 3\u2032) and mVK-r (5\u2032 GGA TACA GTT GGT GCA GCA TC\n3\u2032) (Du et al., 2013a) were used\nfor the variable region of the light chain (VL)\ngene. Sequence-confirmed VH and\nVL genes were inserted into the pRBO/Ig\nexpression vector (containing human IgG1-and human immunoglobulin kappa chain\nconstant regions). Recombinant plasmid was transfected into 293F cells and\nhumanized mAb was purified from the cell culture supernatants. Purified hMS-1\nmAbs were resolved by reducing 12% sodium dodecyl\nsulphate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and non-reducing 8%\nSDS-PAGE, respectively.\n\nThe reactivity of hMS-1 and MERS-CoV RBD was detected by ELISA as\ndescribed (Du et al., 2014). Briefly,\nELISA plates were coated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with His6-tagged\nRBD protein (1 \u00b5g/ml) and blocked with 2% no-fat milk at 37\n\u00b0C for 2 h. Serial diluted hMS-1 or trastuzumab control (Roche, Roswell,\nGA, USA) was added to the plates and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h.\nHorseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (1:5,000, Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) was then added and further incubated at 37\n\u00b0C for 1 h. The reaction was visualized by TMB substrate addition\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and stopped by 1N H2SO4.\nThe absorbance at 450 nm was measured using an ELISA plate reader (BioTek,\nWinooski, VT, USA). The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50)\nof hMS-1 was calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.01 software (La Jolla, CA, USA).\nhMS-1 epitope mapping was performed by ELISA as described above except that the\nELISA plates were coated with a series of mutant RBD proteins (2.5\n\u00b5g/ml).\n\nThe affinity of hMS-1 binding to the MERS-CoV RBD was assayed using a\nBiacore T100 instrument (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). hMS-1 (5\n\u00b5g/ml) was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip with an amine coupling kit.\nThe reference flow cell was treated with amine coupling reagent without exposure\nto hMS-1. The running buffer was HBS-EP (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM\nEDTA, and 0.05% surfactant P20). His6-tagged RBD protein at\ngradient concentrations (2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 nM) was flowed over the chip\nsurface. The chip was regenerated with 100 mM H3PO4. The\nsensorgram was analyzed using BIAevaluation software, and the data were fitted\nto a 1:1 binding model.\n\nThe MERS-CoV neutralization assay was performed as\ndescribed (Du et al., 2013b; Tao et al., 2013). Briefly, serially\n2-fold-diluted hMS-1 or a trastuzumab control was incubated with 100 50%\ntissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of MERS-CoV at 37 \u00b0C\nfor 1 h followed by incubation with Vero cells at 37 \u00b0C for 72 h. The\ncytopathic effect (CPE) was observed daily and recorded on day 3 following\ninoculation. The 50% neutralizing dose (ND50) was calculated\nby the Reed-Muench method (Reed and Muench,\n1938) and determined as the antibody concentration that completely\ninhibited virus-induced CPE in at least 50% of the wells.\n\nDetermination of the hMS-1 inhibitory ability against the binding\nbetween MERS-CoV RBD and hDPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells was performed by flow\ncytometry as described (Du et al.,\n2013b). Briefly, Huh-7 cells (5 \u00d7 105) were incubated\nwith Fc-fused RBD protein (2 \u00b5g/ml) in the presence of serially diluted\nhMS-1 or with the trastuzumab control at room temperature for 30 min, followed\nby incubation with DyLight 488-labeled goat anti-human IgG antibody at room\ntemperature for 30 min. The fluorescence signals were analyzed by flow cytometry\n(Guava, EMD Millipore, Germany).\n\nThe pseudovirus neutralization assay was performed as described (Zhao et al., 2013). Briefly, 293T cells\nwere co-transfected with plasmids encoding an Env-defective,\nluciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome (pNL4-3.luc.RE) and encoding the MERS-CoV\nspike protein (EMC2012 strain) or MERS-CoV emergent strains with the\ncorresponding RBD mutations, to package pseudotyped MERS-CoVs. Pseudoviruses\nwere incubated with serially diluted hMS-1 at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h and the\nmixture was then added to Huh-7 cells pre-plated in 96-well tissue culture\nplates (104/well) 6 h before inoculation. After 72 h, the cells were\nlysed with cell lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and transferred into\n96-well luminometer plates. The luciferase activity was determined using an\nInfinite M1000 luminometer (Tecan, San Jose, CA, USA). ND50 was\ncalculated using the dose-response inhibition model in GraphPad Prism.\n\nA total of 278 full-length spike protein sequences were collected from\nthe MERS Coronavirus Database of The Virus Variation Resource (Brister et al., 2014) for multiple sequence\nalignment using the MUSCLE program (Edgar,\n2004). GenBank accession numbers of selected MERS-CoV isolates are\nlisted in Supplementary materials and\nmethods.\n\nWe used 8\u201310-week-old female hDPP4-Tg mice to evaluate the hMS-1\npassive therapeutic effect against lethal MERS-CoV infection (Zhao et al., 2015). Following\nintraperitoneal anesthetization with sodium pentobarbital (5 mg/kg of body\nweight), mice under lethal virus infection were intranasally inoculated with\n104.6 TCID50 MERS-CoV (EMC2012 strain) in 20\n\u00b5l Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM). After 24\nh, the mice were intravenously injected with 2 mg/kg purified hMS-1 or the\ntrastuzumab mAb control. Infected mice were observed for 23 days to calculate\nthe body weight change and survival rate. Additionally, 5 mice were sacrificed\nfrom each group on day 3 post-infection and lung tissues were collected for\nvirological detection and histopathological evaluation.\n\nViral titer was detected as described (Zhao et al., 2015). Briefly, mouse lung tissues were homogenized in\nDMEM plus antibiotics to achieve 10% (w/v) suspensions, which were then\ntitrated on monolayers of Vero cells in quadruplicate. The CPE was observed\ndaily under phase-contrast microscopy for 3 days. The viral titer was calculated\nby the Reed-Muench method and expressed as log10TCID50/g\nof tissue.\n\nCollected tissues were immediately fixed in 10% neutral buffered\nformalin and then embedded in paraffin. Sections (4 \u00b5m in thickness)\nwere generated, mounted onto slides, and stained by hematoxylin and eosin\n(H&E). Histopathological changes were observed using light microscopy.\nThe extent of lung injury was scored according to the levels of degeneration and\nnecrosis of the bronchi and bronchiolar epithelium, infiltration of inflammatory\ncells, alveoli degeneration and collapse, expansion of the parenchymal wall,\nhemorrhage, and interstitial edema (Sun et al.,\n2013).\n\nStatistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.01.\nThe significance between survival curves was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival\nanalysis with a log-rank test. Other data were analyzed using the 2-tailed\nunpaired t-test with Welch\u2019s correction.\np < 0.05 was considered significant.\n\nHumanized mAb hMS-1 was expressed in 293F cells and purified by HiTrap\nProtein A FF. Reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE showed that hMS-1 migrated as a\nsingle protein of approximately 180 kDa and dissociated into heavy and light\nchains of about 50 and 26 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 1A and B), in accordance with the characteristics of a\nhumanized antibody. The reactivity of hMS-1 to MERS-CoV RBD was subsequently\nmeasured by ELISA. As shown in Table 1,\nhMS-1 maintained the ability of the parental Meramb1 mAb to react strongly with\nMERS-CoV RBD, with an EC50 of 1.67 \u00b5g/ml. Comparatively, the\ntrastuzumab control did not react with RBD (data not shown). The interaction\nbetween hMS-1 and MERS-CoV RBD was also characterized by SPR, showing a\nKd of 44.7 pM. These results suggest that a\nhumanized mAb, hMS-1, was successfully generated, which exhibited high affinity\nMERS-CoV RBD binding.\n\nThe neutralizing activity of hMS-1 against live MERS-CoV infection was\ndetermined. hMS-1 could potently neutralize infection of live MERS-CoV (EMC2012\nstrain) in permissive Vero cells with an ND50 of 3.34 \u00b5g/ml\n(Table 1) whereas trastuzumab did not\nexhibit antiviral activity against MERS-CoV infection. These results suggest\nthat humanized hMS-1 maintained the potent ability to neutralize MERS-CoV\ninfection.\n\nSince hMS-1 targeted the MERS-CoV RBD, its neutralization mechanism was\nthus investigated by measuring its ability to block the binding between MERS-CoV\nRBD and the hDPP4 receptor by flow cytometric analysis (Du et al., 2014). Whereas high fluorescence intensity was\ndetected in Huh-7 cells incubated with RBD protein alone, only background\nfluorescence levels were observed in the RBD-Huh-7 binding samples in the\npresence of hMS-1 at 5 \u00b5g/ml. This suggested that hMS-1 was able to\nstrongly block the binding between MERS-CoV RBD and cell-associated hDPP4 (Fig. 2A) and that the blocking effect\noccurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.\n2B). In contrast, trastuzumab did not affect MERS-CoV RBD binding to\nthe DPP4-expressing Huh-7 cells (Fig. 2A and\nB). These results strongly suggest that hMS-1 neutralized MERS-CoV\ninfection by inhibiting the binding of MERS-CoV RBD to hDPP4.\n\nTo identify the epitopes on the MERS-CoV RBD recognized by hMS-1, we\nutilized a panel of mutant RBD proteins generated by mutating the key residues\nat the MERS-CoV RBD and the hDPP4 binding interface to alanine (Du et al., 2014); the binding between hMS-1\nand the respective mutant RBD proteins was then measured by ELISA as described\n(Gao et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2013). hMS-1 was not capable of\nrecognizing the RBD of the R511A mutant and reduced its binding to RBDs with\nmutations at D510A and W553A, respectively (Fig.\n3A). In comparison, the remaining mutations on the RBD did not affect\nthe binding between hMS-1 and RBD with the exception of L506A, which exhibited a\nslight loss of binding activity. A pseudovirus neutralization assay further\nrevealed that pseudotyped MERS-CoV expressing the spike protein containing\nR511A, D510A, or W553A mutants completely abolished (R511A), or reduced (D510A\nor W553A) the inhibitory effect of hMS-1 on pseudovirus infection. In contrast,\nL506A did not change the ability of hMS-1 to inhibit MERS pseudovirus infection\n(Fig. 3B). These results indicate that\nthe R511 residue of RBD is a crucial neutralizing epitope recognized by\nhMS-1.\n\nAlignment of 278 full-length spike protein sequences deposited in the\nNCBI MERS-CoV database illustrated that the RBD epitope recognized by hMS-1 is\nhighly conserved among MERS-CoV emergent isolates (Supplementary Fig. 1). In\nparticular, the R511 residue was not naturally mutated during MERS-CoV\nevolution, indicating the ability of hMS-1 to cross-neutralize MERS-CoV emergent\nstrains. To further understand whether the natural RBD mutations of the evolved\nstrains of MERS-CoV isolated from the 2012 to 2015 outbreaks affected the hMS-1\nneutralizing activity, we constructed a series of pseudoviruses expressing\nMERS-CoV spike proteins with these mutated RBD residues. hMS-1 exhibited potent\nneutralizing activities toward all MERS mutant pseudoviruses tested, with\nND50 values ranging from 0.009 to 0.091 \u00b5g/ml (Table 2). These results suggest that hMS-1\nexhibits the ability to cross-neutralize emergent MERS-CoV isolates.\n\nBecause wild-type mice are not permissive to MERS-CoV infection (Coleman et al., 2014), the passive\nimmunotherapeutic effect of hMS-1 was evaluated in the hDPP4-Tg mouse model in\nwhich MERS-CoV infection can lead to a fatal outcome. After 24 h following\nlethal infection of MERS-CoV (104.6 TCID50 EMC2012),\nhDPP4-Tg mice were intravenously injected with a single-dose (2 mg/kg) of hMS-1\nor the trastuzumab mAb control and viral titers, histopathological changes, body\nweight changes, and survival rates were calculated. Viral titers were measured\nfrom mouse lungs at three days following viral infection; these demonstrated\nthat mice receiving hMS-1 treatment exhibited significantly lower viral titers\nthan those receiving the trastuzumab mAb control (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4A), suggesting that hMS-1 can inhibit\nMERS-CoV infection in vivo. Further examination of associated\nhistopathological changes illustrated that hMS-1 treatment significantly\nalleviated the lung injury induced by MERS-CoV infection (p < 0.01)\n(Fig. 4B). The hMS-1-treated hDPP4-Tg\nmice under lethal MERS-CoV infection exhibited fewer histopathological changes\n(Fig. 4C\u2013F), and were\naccompanied by only a small degree of inflammatory cell infiltration in the lung\ninterstitial tissues (Fig. 4E, F). In\ncontrast, severe lung damage was observed in the control mice (Fig. 4G\u2013J), which developed marked\ninterstitial pneumonia with focal exudation (Fig.\n4H), macrophage infiltration (Fig.\n4I), hemorrhage (Fig. 4J), and\nalveolar septal thickening (Fig. 4H, J). In\naddition, hMS-1-treated mice exhibited only slight decreases of body weight by\nday 11 followed by subsequent recovery, whereas control mice demonstrated\ndramatic body weight loss (Fig. 5A).\nNotably, all hMS-1-treated mice survived lethal MERS-CoV infection whereas all\ncontrol group animals died by day 10 post-infection (p < 0.01) (Fig. 5B). These results confirmed that\nsingle-dose hMS-1 mAb treatment was able to completely protect hDPP4-Tg mice\nfrom lethal MERS-CoV infection.\n\nMERS-CoV infects humans with high associated mortality, posing a large\nthreat to public health and reinforcing the urgency to develop effective vaccines\nand therapeutics. A number of therapeutic mAbs have been applied clinically to\nprevent and treat viral infections (Murray et al.,\n2014; Qiu et al., 2014),\nsuggesting that neutralizing mAbs might represent a promising approach to combat\nMERS-CoV infection as well. The MERS-CoV RBD can elicit strong neutralizing antibody\nresponse and contains a critical neutralizing domain (Ma et al., 2014; Zhang et al.,\n2016), thus representing an ideal target for neutralizing mAb\ndevelopment. Notably, almost all reported MERS-CoV neutralizing mAbs including\nmurine, human, and humanized mAbs, target the RBD (Corti et al., 2015; Du et al.,\n2014; Jiang et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015; Pascal et al., 2015; Tang et\nal., 2014; Ying et al., 2014;\nYu et al., 2015). We previously developed\nan RBD-targeting murine neutralizing mAb, Mersmab1, and demonstrated its ability to\nneutralize MERS-CoV infection (Du et al.,\n2014). Here, we further humanized this mAb and evaluated its binding\naffinity to RBD, inhibitory ability against RBD-hDPP4 binding, and neutralizing and\ncross-neutralizing activity against divergent MERS-CoV strains isolated from the\n2012\u20132015 outbreaks. The therapeutic potential of the humanized hMS-1 mAb\nwas also investigated in hDPP4-Tg mice.\n\nOur data clearly showed that humanized hMS-1 mAb maintained strong\nreactivity to the RBD, significantly blocking RBD/hDPP4 receptor binding and\npotently neutralizing MERS-CoV infection. As it has been demonstrated that MERS-CoV\nunderwent evolution during the 2012\u20132015 outbreaks (Cotten et al., 2013; Sabir et\nal., 2016), we evaluated the hMS-1 cross-neutralizing activity against\nthese MERS-CoV emergent strains. hMS-1 recognized three key residues (neutralizing\nepitopes) of MERS-CoV RBD all of which were highly conserved during MERS-CoV\nevolution, leading to the hypothesis that hMS-1 might be effective in combatting the\ninfections of different MERS-CoV emerging isolates. Notably, hMS-1 could potently\nneutralize a series of pseudoviruses expressing the spike proteins of MERS-CoVs\nisolated from outbreaks in different regions including Saudi Arabia and South Korea\nover the 2012\u20132015 period, demonstrating its cross-neutralizing activity\nagainst MERS-CoV spread and evolution.\n\nSeveral neutralizing mAbs including LCA60, REGN3051, REGN3048, 4C2h, and\nm336 have been tested in vivo for their protective efficacy using\nnon-lethal MERS-CoV challenge mouse or rabbit models (Corti et al., 2015; Li et al.,\n2015; Pascal et al., 2015; Houser et al., 2016). In this study, we\nevaluated the protective efficacy of hMS-1 in a lethal hDPP4-Tg mouse model, wherein\nwe demonstrated that a single-dose (2 mg/kg) of hMS-1 completely protected hDPP4-Tg\nmice from a lethal challenge from MERS-CoV. This study therefore suggests that hMS-1\nmight be further developed as a potent passive therapeutic agent to treat patients\ninfected with MERS-CoV."}
