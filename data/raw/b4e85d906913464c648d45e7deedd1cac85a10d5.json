[3] [4] [5] Indeed, the role of face touching and surface contact has been recognized as a driver of viral transmission for decades, 6 and a meta-analysis demonstrated that hand washing was associated with a 24% reduction in viral transmission -suggesting that hand-toface contact may play a substantial role in infection.\n\nThe presence of even mild abrasions on the central face may increase the likelihood of face touching while not using PPE, or inadvertent PPE protocol breaches such as mask touching or adjustment in an unconscious effort to relieve a source of irritation.\n\nThe importance of adherence to strict PPE protocols is paramount, as the infection of two HCWs during the Ebola outbreak was tied to possible PPE protocol adherence breaches. 7 Inappropriate doffing of PPE in HCWs is common: one study found that 26% of HCWs inappropriately touched the front of their mask while doffing, and approximately one half touched a potentially contaminated PPE surface with an ungloved hand. 7 What can be done to limit these risks? First, educating HCWs to expect some mild skin irritation may be helpful. Second, if topical agents are used to reduce irritation, this could be considered a high-risk activity, and introducing topical ointment to the skin should be done with great care, for example using as a sterile cotton-tipped applicator and a single-use petroleum jelly pack prior to possible exposure. Third, those with a history of sensitivity may wish to explore other options aside from an N95 respirator and goggles, such as full-face respirator or using a full-face shield rather than goggles. Given their added cost and decreased availability, however, these may not be feasible options. Finally, while the authors mention the possibility of prophylactic dressing use to mitigate the risk of skin-related complications of PPE use, this approach has not been studied, and -more importantly -the potential impact of such dressings on PPE efficacy is unexplored. Given the very high stakes associated with adequate and reliable PPE functioning, future studies exploring approaches to mitigate the risk of PPE-induced irritation, and potential improvements in PPE design, are warranted."}
