{"title": "MERS coronavirus induces apoptosis in kidney and lung by upregulating Smad7 and FGF2", "body": "The EMC/2012 strain of MERS-CoV (passage 8, designated MERS-CoV) was provided by R. Fouchier (Erasmus Medical Center)1 and SARS-CoV strain HKU39849 was propagated in VeroE6 cells (ATCC) in Dulbecco modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 100 units ml\u20131 penicillin plus 100 \u00b5g ml\u20131 streptomycin (1% PS). All experiments were performed as previously described according to biosafety level 3 practices26,28,29.\n\nThe 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per ml was determined for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in VeroE6 cells as described previously6. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 5 \u00d7 104 cells per well in 150 \u00b5l DMEM. The virus was serially diluted by half-log from 103 to 1014 in DMEM. One hundred microlitres of each dilution was added per well and the plates were observed daily for cytopathic effect for five consecutive days.\n\nCalu-3 (ATCC) is an epithelial cell line derived from human lung adenocarcinoma and were cultured in ATCC-formulated Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% PS. Normal human mesangial cells (NHMCs; Lonza) were cultured in mesangial cell basal medium (MsBM; Lonza) supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% PS, 5 \u00b5g ml\u20131 transferrin and 5 \u00b5g ml\u20131 insulin. The podocyte cell line30 was cultured in RPMI (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% PS at 33 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. The podocytes were induced to differentiate at 37 \u00b0C for 3 days before infection. All experiments using NHMCs and podocytes were performed within their tenth passage. All cell lines used in the study were authenticated by Southern and FISH analyses and were confirmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination as determined by Plasmo Test (InvivoGen).\n\nEtoposide and MDIVI were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology and Sigma, respectively. The overexpression construct of BIRC3 was purchased from Origene. siGENOME human siRNA-SMARTpools targeting CLU, SOD1 and CAT and Smad7-1 siRNA (5\u2032-GUUCAGGACCAAACGAUCUGC-3\u2032; 5\u2032-GCAGAUCGUUUGGUCCUGAACAU-3\u2032) and Smad7-2 siRNA (5\u2032-CUCACGCACUCGGUGCUCAAG-3\u2032; 5\u2032-CUUGAGCACCGAGUGCGUGAGCG-3\u2032) were purchased from Thermo Scientific Dharmacon. Antisense oligonucleotide targeting Smad7 (anti-Smad7 oligo; 5\u2032-GTCGCCCCTTCTCCCCGCAG-3\u2032; also named GED0301)19,20 was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies with the following modifications: (1) the cytosine preceding the guanosine was replaced with a 5-methyl-deoxycytosine and (2) the internucleotide linkages of the backbone were modified to O,O-linked phosphorothioates.\n\nAll experiments involving human tissues were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster. Fresh surgically resected kidney or lung specimens were obtained from patients undergoing nephrectomy or pneumonectomy, respectively, at Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, as part of standard clinical management. Ex vivo organ cultures were carried out as previously described28. The kidney cortical and lung tissues (in small strips, 1 mm width) were placed directly into a 24-well plate with 1 ml of Kaighn's Modification of Ham's F-12 Medium (F-12 K) with 1% PS at 37 \u00b0C. Tissues were infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV at a virus concentration of 1 \u00d7 106 TCID50 per ml for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C. Unbound viruses were washed away with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Tissues were collected at 0, 18, 48 and 72 h.p.i. and then fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy.\n\nAll experiments involving common marmosets were performed as previously described and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee21. Briefly, six male common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus; 3 years old) were inoculated with 5 \u00d7 106 TCID50 of MERS-CoV intratracheally in 500 \u00b5l DMEM. Sample sizes were based on the availability of common marmosets. Necropsies of the six common marmosets were scheduled for 3 days post infection (d.p.i.). The common marmosets were observed twice daily for clinical signs of disease and scored using a clinical scoring system prepared for common marmosets as described22 (see Supplementary Section \u2018Berlin definition of ARDS\u2019). On 1 and 3 d.p.i., clinical examinations and X-rays were performed on anaesthetized animals. The organs were collected on necropsy for experimental assays as described in ref. 21. No randomization or blinding was done in this study.\n\nInfected primate kidneys were fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde and cryosectioned. The mounted slides were blocked with TBS4 for 1 h followed by 0.1% Sudan Black B (Sigma) for another 25 min. Excess Sudan Black B was washed away three times with PBS and Tween-20 (PBST). MERS-CoV NP was stained with mouse anti-MERS-CoV NP (1:200) overnight at 4 \u00b0C as previously described28. Rabbit antibodies against cell type-specific markers synaptopodin (Abcam), CD31 (Abcam), cytokeratin 18 (Abcam), Smad7 (Santa Cruz), FGF2 (Abcam) and caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology) were also used. Unbound antibodies were washed away three times with PBST. Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) antibodies (1:500; Life Technologies) and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Life Technologies) were then applied to the slides for signal detection, followed by washing three times with PBST. Stained slides were mounted with coverslips in the presence of anti-fade mountant (Dako) and 1 \u00b5g ml\u20131 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma). Human kidney tissues were embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Miles), snap frozen and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C before sectioning. Sections (5\u201310 \u00b5m) were cut on a cryostat and transferred to glass microscope slides pre-coated with poly-lysine (Sigma). Sections were then fixed with cold acetone for 20 min at room temperature. Fixed sections were washed three times with PBS before blocking and staining with anti-MERS-CoV NP as described above. Digital images were acquired using NIKON Eclipse Ni-U with SPOT RT3 camera. To prepare samples for electron microscopic examination, the paraformaldehyde-fixed tissues were post-fixed for 30 min with 0.5% osmium tetroxide/0.8% potassium ferricyanide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, for 1 h with 1% tannic acid and overnight with 1% uranyl acetate at 4 \u00b0C. Specimens were dehydrated with a graded ethanol series from water and then successively at 10, 20, 50, 95 and 100% ethanol followed by two final exchanges in 100% propylene oxide before infiltration and final embedding in Embed-812 resin. Thin sections were cut with a Leica EM UC6 \u03bcLtramicrotome (Leica) and stained with 1% uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate before viewing at 120 kV on a FEI Tecnai G2 20 S-TWIN scanning transmission electron microscope. Digital images were acquired with a Gatan 794 1K \u00d7 1K Camera System with DigitalMicrograph Acquisition Software.\n\nTotal RNAs and viral RNAs were isolated using Trizol (Life Technologies) and the Viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN), respectively, as previously described6. After RNA quantification, 1 \u00b5g of RNAs was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamers. Total MERS-CoV transcripts were detected with a Novel Coronavirus 2012 Real-Time RT-PCR assay (CDC; catalog no. KT0136). The viral RNAs isolated from cell lysates and conditioned media were normalized to the mRNA expression level of GAPDH and a spike-in control, enterovirus 71 (EV71) strain SZ/HK08-5, using primers 5\u2032-GCTCACTGGCATGGCCTTCCGTGT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGGAGGAGTGGGTGTCGCTGTTGA-3\u2032 (GAPDH) as well as 5\u2032-CCCCTGAATGCGGCTAATCC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032- ACACGGACACCCAAAGTAGT-3\u2032 (EV71). For each reaction, equal amounts of cDNA were mixed with FS Universal SYBR Green Master Rox (Roche) plus 5 pmol each of forward and reverse primers. Amplification was performed for 15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 1 min at 60 \u00b0C for 55 cycles in a 7900 real-time PCR detection system (ABI).\n\nMultiple dishes of cells were seeded under the same culture conditions. Infections of all dishes of cells were performed simultaneously using a master mix of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV to minimize variation. At the indicated time points, total RNAs of the infected cells were collected. The altered gene expression following MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection at different time points were then compared with those at time point zero. The samples from time point zero were subjected to the corresponding virus inoculation, then immediately washed and immediately harvested to ensure that the detected gene alteration was not due to the virus inoculation process. The sequencing libraries were prepared at the Centre for Genomic Sciences at the University of Hong Kong using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) and were subsequently sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. Briefly, mRNA was isolated using polyT oligo-attached magnetic beads. The purified mRNA was fragmented and reverse transcribed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) to first-strand cDNA in the presence of random hexamers. Double-stranded cDNAs were synthesized by second strand synthesis and then subjected to end repair, 3\u2032 adenylation and indexed adaptor ligation. The adaptor-ligated sequencing libraries were further enriched by ten cycles of PCR, quantified and sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 with 101 bp paired-end reads. Image analyses and base calling were performed with SCS2.8/RTA1.8 (Illumina). FASTQ file generation and the removal of failed reads were performed using CASAVA ver.1.8.2 (Illumina). Pathway analyses were performed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Candidate genes from a defined disease pathway (renal necrosis/cell death) that possessed the following criteria were selected for further analyses: (1) the absolute gene expression level should be markedly induced; (2) the trend of gene expression should be consistent throughout the course of infection; (3) the tissue-specificity of the identified genes should not be restricted only to lung, but should be expressed in kidney; (4) a differential response of the gene expression pattern should be observed when infected with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, separately.\n\nA caspase-3/CPP32 fluorometric assay kit (BioVision) was used to measure caspase-3 activity. Briefly, cells were plated in six-well dishes, cultured, collected and lysed in lysis buffer at 0, 8, 24, 48 and 72 h.p.i. After the protein concentration was normalized by the Bradford assay, the lysates were incubated with the same amounts of reaction buffer and 50 mmol l\u20131 DEVD-AFC substrate for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. Fluorescence was monitored with an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an emission wavelength of 505 nm. Apoptosis in cells that were infected by MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV or transfected with overexpression constructs Smad7 (Origene) or FGF2 (Origene) were measured by ApopTag Red In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Chemicon). Briefly, treated cells on the coverslips were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. Cells undergoing apoptosis with DNA breakage will be labelled with TdT enzyme in the presence of digoxigennin-modified nucleotides. The coverslips were then mounted on the slides in the presence of VECTASHIELD Antifade mounting medium with DAPI (Vector lab). Signal detection was facilitated by the addition of anti-digoxigenin conjugate followed by examination under a fluorescence microscopy (NIKON Eclipse Ni-U) with SPOT RT3 camera.\n\nData have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive under accession code SRP056612."}
