{"title": "Necessity of a More Standardized Virological Characterization of Rodents for Aging Studies", "body": "IT is common knowledge that certain murine microorganisms such as viruses have the capacity to cause biological alterations that can have great influence on the course and the results of experiments, and can even lead to premature termination of a study. There is abundant evidence that these agents interfere with a wide diversity of studies, both short-as well as longterm (including aging studies). The loss of breeding production in rodent colonies or loss of the entire colony by overt disease is disruptive to research, and it is relatively easy to persuade an investigator of the usefulness of using virus-free animals after the experience of an overt disease in his colony. However, it is a common characteristic, especially of viral infections in colonies of laboratory animals, that pathogens may persist in a colony without causing any clinical or pathological symptom. This may make results from research less reliable, a point that is frequently overlooked by the investigator. Thus quality biomedical studies of aging are not only dependent on the use of diseasefree animals but also on animals free from latent infections.\n\nHsu (2) and others (1) have summarized much of the data pertaining to the effects of murine microorganisms on biomedical research, and van Zwieten et al. (13) have reviewed the possible influence on aging studies. A great number of the infectious agents reduce the mean lifetime of animals in an infected colony and some will alter such organ systems as the nervous system (1) more or less in their specific functions.\n\nDuring the past 30 years, progress has been made in identifying and controlling intercurrent diseases and latent infections. Programs to assess the health status of rodents and to characterize their virological status have been developed (2, 7) . These programs have also been used to monitor animals before they enter the research or breeding colony as well as to control the health status of animals in experiments, in quarantine, and in intramural breeding colonies.\n\nAlthough in the 1970s it was almost impossible to obtain virus-free animals, during the early 1980s many colonies were caesarian-derived and transferred into barrier type facilities de-signed to exclude adventitious viruses. Serological data showed that these measures can be effective (12) , and many breeding facilities have since adopted them to produce and supply clean animals (5) . However, there was only minor improvement in the ability of a great number of institutional and research facilities to maintain laboratory animals free from viruses. Many investigators still ignored the numerous reports describing experimental complications associated with murine infections and continued to fail to appreciate the value of health surveillance testing and barrier maintenance as methods of preventing research variability due to microbiological agents.\n\nMore recently, scientists have become increasingly aware of the need for well-standardized laboratory animals. This can be seen in several areas. (A) More rodents are being used in longterm experiments in the field of aging, carcinogenesis, toxicology, nutrition, immunology, and virology. Losses in such studies by intercurrent infection in animals have great financial as well as scientific consequences. (B) In the past much experimental use of laboratory animals was based on endpoint assessments such as mortality and morbidity. Today, we are measuring more subtle changes in specific functions of specialized rodent cells or rodent organ systems. (C) New legislation for controlling the safety of biological products with respect to the hazards of viral contaminants has been introduced by government agencies. There is an increasing application of preparations derived from laboratory animals for diagnostic and therapeutic use in humans. (D) Opposition from antivivisectionists has forced leaders of laboratory animal science to attend carefully to issues of animal protection in experiments--for example, increasing the quality standard of animals reduces the number of animals that are necessary for experiments by reducing the number of experimental failures due to interference with murine infections.\n\nIn summary, new standards for quality of animals are being set up. Quality assurance of these animals begins with defining and controlling microbiological status. Thus there is an increasing demand to standardize health monitoring programs and mi-vA,~ DER LOGT crobiological characterization of laboratory rodents.\n\nIt should first be emphasized that characterization of the microbiological status of laboratory rodents is only one facet of a quality assurance program, and that efforts for such standardization should be in good relation to other factors such as transportation systems, quarantine, and housing facilities of the user. When animals are transported under poor conditions and introduced after an inadequate quarantine period in established colonies, there is a high risk of mutual contamination of the animals. Management and the establishment of a full quality assurance program have been covered in a recent review (8) to which the reader is directed. Complete details of microbiological characterization of laboratory animals are also beyond the scope of this paper, and programs for diagnosis of viruses, bacteria, chlamydia, fungi, mycoplasmas, and parasites are readily available (4, 7) . The purpose of this report is to address basic matters concerning standardization of the characterization of murine viral status.\n\nAt the present time more than 25 distinctive virus species have been isolated from laboratory rodents and their biology and pathogenesis has been described extensively (1) . There is, however, a scarcity of recent reports on the prevalence of viruses, especially in rodents other than mice and rats, and there are also some discrepancies in the selection of viruses used in the screening programs and in the incidences of virus infections reported, with a broad range in prevalence rates (Tables 1 and 2 ). This divergence may be explained by the fact that different techniques were used in the various screening programs and the results were obtained with colonies from different areas of the world. Further, the distribution of some viruses throughout the world (EDIM, cytomegalovirus, thymic virus) is currently unknown and there has been no recent survey of the incidence of LDV infections among laboratory mice.\n\nAccording to recent reports in Western Europe and North America, the most prevalent viruses in mice are MHV, MVM, sendal, PVM, Reo, and TEMV. In rats the incidence is the highest for the parvoviruses, TMEV, PVM, RCV/SDA, sendai, and Reo. More regular reports on the prevalence of these viruses not only in murine but also of viruses in other rodents would certainly help in developing a more standardized list of viruses used in monitoring programs.\n\nViral infections can be detected by a number of methods which are more or less suitable for routine use: I. Clinical Signs. As mentioned before, viral infections are often subclinical, so observation of clinical signs is not a reliable method; morphological changes in organs are primarily observed in animals that are already seriously ill. Such changes may also not be specific, so pathology has limited value.\n\nVirus isolation, often termed the \"gold standard\" to which all other methods should be compared, results in the identification of the etiological agent. Unsuspected viruses may also be detected. This method, however, requires specialized facilities and is time consuming and expensive. Furthermore, the active phase of infection is often short-lived and may give false negative results. The same holds, in addition, for other methods for virus detection by direct assays for viral antigens or nucleic acid in tissue specimens.\n\n3. Serological Tests. The most generally used method to characterize the viral status of rodents is the demonstration of virus specific immunity by detection of specific antibody with serological tests. These antibodies are specific and persistent and can be rapidly and reliably detected with simple inexpensive techniques. The major disadvantages of the serological test are that unknown viruses will not be detected and for certain viruses there is no serological test available (e.g., lactic dehydrogenase elevating virus, LDV). In some cases of viral infection, no antibody is produced (e.g., lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, LCM). Since antibody may not appear in serum until 7-14 days after the beginning of infection, serological tests may not be suitable for detection of acute infection.\n\nAnother factor that is important for the interpretation of serological results is potential cross-reactivity. Different strains of viruses may cross-react in a serological test and so the test will not reliably distinguish between individual serotypes [i.e., ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) or FA (fluorescent antibody test) and parvoviruses] (10) .\n\nDuring the last decade there has been a change in the meth-ods used in serology. Traditional tests such as CF (complement fixation) are disappearing and new techniques have been introduced. These different test systems have been reviewed extensively (9) . Although the insensitive CF is still sometimes used, it is well accepted now that ELISA and FA are the primary techniques of choice and that HA1 (hemagglutination inhibition) may sometimes be used as an altemative method to confirm primary test results or to specify strains. The ELISA is technically easy to perform and is more sensitive than CF and HAI. FA is more expensive and time consuming and slides must be interpreted by trained experienced personnel in order to obtain valid results. Furthermore, although FA is less quantitative it is especially suited as a confirmatory assay and should be used in the event of positive results. One of the major problems of ELISA (and FA) is the lack of a standard method for performing the test or reporting the results among different laboratories.\n\nAnother new test, the Western Blotting technique (11) , identifies the viral proteins to which antibody is produced. It is an excellent alternative, and provides reliable confirmation of primary positive test results. Due to costs this technique will probably only be applied in research and diagnostic reference laboratories.\n\nStandard operating procedures for methodology used by testing laboratories and the availability of standardized viral antigens and reference sera (with activities expressed in international units) would be of great help in endeavors to increase the interlaboratory standardization of the microbiological characterization of rodents.\n\nThere are a number of factors to consider with regard to which viruses should be included in health monitoring of rodent populations:\n\n1. Is the agent capable of episodically infecting rodents, does the enzootic infection result in clinical or histological diseases, and are rodents the primary host?\n\n2. Does the virus have an established effect on research other than overt clinical signs or death?\n\n3. Is the agent ubiquitous, and is there any hazard to humans such as zoonotic potential of LCM and Hantaan? 4. What are the specific requirements of the investigator? 5. What is the aim of the testing program? Is the screening program for the microbiological characterization of large breeding populations, for more frequent control of defined breeding units (barrier-maintained or not), or for all incoming animals? 6. How significant or common are the viruses that may be encountered? Some viruses are infrequently encountered and therefore do not represent significant problems to breeders or investigators, whereas others are frequently found. In the latter case, limited programs rather than total microbiological analyses may be used for controlling microbiological status during the course of an experiment. Sentinel animals with a defined health status can be used when it is difficult to obtain samples from animals in a study.\n\nIn summary, there is no single answer as to how a screening list should be formulated. Different lists have been published, and different lists are in use in the various diagnostic laboratories and breeding facilities. A proposal for the formulation of a more standardized screening list for murine viruses according to our recent knowledge and increasing demands is shown in Tables 3 and 4. Rarely can each shipment of animals from outside sources be checked thoroughly before use. Therefore, reliability and standardization of the health reports from the supplier play a very critical role. Blood may be obtained aseptically and without additives from the brachial vessels, jugular vein, periorbital venous sinus, or heart. Hemolysis should be avoided by not forcing the blood through a small needle or storing the blood too long prior to separation of the serum fraction by centrifugation (for 5 to 10 min at 2000 x g). Serum before testing can be stored at 4\u00b0C and should be frozen at -20\u00b0C for longer periods of time.\n\nShipment is possible by express mail either at lowered temperature or after addition of a preservative (0.01% thimerosai). Labeled samples should be accompanied with information on the serum dilution, rodent species, and name and telephone/telex/or fax number of the sender.\n\nPooling of sera should absolutely be avoided as this will reduce antibody titre levels. Indeed, sera may become useless if one of the samples contains nonspecific activity [for more detailed information on serum collection, see (4) ]. \n\nFor purposes of serology retired breeders of immunologically competent strains are generally recommended for monitoring. Sample size is based on statistical considerations which have been discussed elsewhere (2) , and formulas have been developed which may be used to calculate the sample size. The sample size is independent of the size of the population if the population is at least 100 or more animals. In short, given an expected percent of infection in a population, and assuming that the screening procedure is 100% accurate, Table 5 shows a sample size that will give at least one positive reaction with a normally acceptable confidence limit (>0.95). If, for example, an infection rate of 30% is expected, then 9 samples should be taken. If multiple agents are screened, the lowest expected morbidity rate should be used.\n\nThere is no single answer regarding test frequency, which is governed by a number of factors. One sampling reflects the actual status in a colony, but this may change after sampling. The type of physical facilities, husbandry practices, rate of introduction of new animals and biological materials, economic consid-erations, and investigation requirements are all factors of importance in determining sampling frequencies. Sampling frequencies reported in the literature range from a six-week sampiing frequency (when pathogens invade a colony the development of antibody lasts at least four to six weeks) to once a year for infections that are not very likely to occur.\n\nDuring the last 30 years significant progress has been made in understanding how to produce, control, and maintain laboratory animals free of viral infections. There is, however, still a lot of work to do. For several reasons, results are often disappointing in practice. One important reason for these failures is lack of international standardization of programs and methods used to control and characterize the microbiological status of laboratory animals, as well as lack of a standardized health report.\n\nOrganizing the professional community may strongly contribute to increasing such standardization. Worldwide, ICLAS (International Council for Laboratory Animal Science) has promoted the establishment of a microbiological monitoring system (6) and is reorganizing the present system to meet the changing requirements of the times. In North America, Committees of ACLAD (American Committee on Laboratory Animal Diseases), and in Europe, a working group of FELASA (Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations), are actively developing standard formulas for laboratory health monitoring and health reports, as well as a quality assurance program in which diagnostic laboratories could participate. This task would be greatly abetted if editorial boards of scientific journals would request authors of scientific papers based on experiments with laboratory animals to provide details concerning maintenance and welfare of animals during the experiments, a specific recommendation of ICLAS (3)."}
