Recent studies indicate that short peptide motifs within the HVD direct nsP3 binding to host SG proteins [39, 40, 43] . Specifically, two repeat peptide motifs within the HVD of the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV) bind to the essential SG components G3BP1 and G3BP2 [40, 44] . Given that the expression of alphaviral nsP3 alone suppresses SG formation and nsP3 expression increases over the course of viral infection, it was proposed that nsP3 sequesters G3BP1/2 resulting in SG disassembly during the late phase of infection [35, 36, 41] .\n\nHere, we report that the expression of the G3BP-binding HVD alone did not suppress SG formation; instead, the expression of the N-terminal MD alone is sufficient to suppress SG formation.\n\nRecently, we and others have reported that the viral MD possesses enzymatic activity for removal of single ADP-ribose groups, and possibly PAR, from ADP-ribosylated proteins [38, [45] [46] [47] . Given that the structural integrity of SGs is dependent on ADP-ribosylation [19] , we hypothesized, and identified, that the MD ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity is required for suppressing the formation of SGs induced by stress, with G3BP1 as one of the target substrates. This enzymatic activity is required for alteration of SG composition by releasing translation factors from a condensated state in nsP3-expressing cells.\n\nIntriguingly, nsP3 expression also suppresses the formation of and disassembles SG-like aggregates induced by a pathological mutant of the RNA-binding protein FUS (R495X) from an aggressive form of ALS [48, 49] . These data altogether suggest that nsP3 ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity is able to disrupt SG formation in both physiological and pathological conditions.\n\nOverexpression of alphaviral nsP3 alone suppresses the formation of SGs even in the presence of the classic SG inducer arsenite [36, [40] [41] [42] . The current paradigm is that the essential SG component G3BP1 is sequestered by nsP3 in another class of cytoplasmic structure that does not contain the All rights reserved.

Given that G3BP1 and its paralog G3BP2 bind to the Cterminal HVD of nsP3 (nsP3 HVD ) [40, 41, 44, [50] [51] [52] , their localization in these nsP3-positive foci is expected.\n\nHowever, it is unclear whether the mechanism for sequestration of G3BP by the HVD is sufficient to cause the disappearance of SGs because the domain binds multiple cellular proteins [39, 50, 53] and cellular G3BP1/2 are highly abundant (Table S1 ).\n\nTo determine whether the nsP3 HVD alone is sufficient to suppress arseniteinduced SG formation, we overexpressed either GFP-tagged full-length nsP3 or the HVD fragment (318-530) and examined the co-localization of nsP3 with SG components G3BP1 and eIF3b in U2OS ( Fig. 1a , S1a) and HeLa cells (Fig. S1b) .\n\nIn untransfected cells, eIF3b and G3BP1 co-localized as foci (i.e., SGs) after All rights reserved.

In cells transfected with full-length nsP3, nsP3 co-localized with G3BP1, but not with eIF3b in the majority of cells examined (73%; Fig. 1a , c), as previously reported [36, 42] . In contrast, in cells transfected with the nsP3 HVD alone, the nsP3 HVD co-localized with both SG components eIF3b and G3BP1 in 93% of cells examined (Fig. 1a, c) . These data indicate that HVD alone cannot suppress SG formation, but instead the domain associates with SG proteins.\n\nTo determine whether the arsenite-induced nsP3 HVD -associated structures shared SG properties, we treated the cells with cycloheximide. Cycloheximide is an elongation inhibitor that traps mRNAs along with translation factors in polysomes, thus decreasing the availability of mRNAs for SG formation and resulting in SG disassembly ( Fig. 1b ; [9] ). Therefore, bona fide SGs disappear upon cycloheximide treatment. After cycloheximide treatment, the nsP3 HVD no longer co-localized with translation factor eIF3b, suggesting that the nsP3 HVD -associated structures formed upon arsenite treatment were SGs (Fig. 1b, c) . On the other hand, the nsP3 HVD remained co-localized with G3BP1 in both unstressed and stressed conditions likely due to their ability to directly interact ( Fig. 1, Fig. S1c ). Taken together with work from others [36, [40] [41] [42] , these data suggest that expression of full-length nsP3 alters the association of individual SG components (e.g., release of eIF3b and retention of G3BP1 with nsP3), and it is likely that domain(s) other than HVD of nsP3 may be responsible for suppressing SG formation.\n\nGiven that the N-terminal MD possesses enzymatic activity to remove ADP-ribosylation [38, 45] and the structural integrity of SGs is dependent on ADP-ribosylation [19] , we hypothesized that the macrodomain of nsP3 (nsP3 MD ) could be responsible for suppressing SG formation. Similar to the fulllength nsP3, overexpression of the MD fragment (1-162) inhibited the formation of SGs upon treatment with arsenite (Fig. 1a , c) or other SG inducers, such as mitochondrial stressor clotrimazole and endoplasmic reticulum stressor thapsigargin (Fig. S1d , e; [9] ). However, unlike full-length nsP3, the nsP3 MD did not co-localize with G3BP1, presumably due to a lack of the G3BP-binding HVD (Fig. 1a) .\n\nThese data together suggest that while the nsP3 HVD is sufficient for formation of structures with SG All rights reserved.

Three classes of MD mutants were used [38] : (1) no ADP-ribose binding and little hydrolase activity (D10A, G32E, and G112E); (2) weak ADP-ribose binding and weak hydrolase activity (G32S); and (3) weak hydrolase activity but stronger ADP-ribosebinding than wild-type (WT) (Y114A). As with WT nsP3, all overexpressed full-length nsP3 MD mutants appeared in G3BP1-positive foci with or without arsenite (Fig. 2a, S2a ). However, unlike WT, all full length nsP3 mutants co-localized with SG components G3BP1 and eIF3b upon arsenite treatment ( Fig.   2a, b ). Given that all tested mutants have deficiencies in ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity, their inability to prevent SG formation is likely due to the absence of this enzymatic activity.\n\nUsing G32E as an example, we characterized further whether the foci formed by nsP3 mutants with G3BP1 and eIF3b share the properties of SGs. To test this possibility, cells expressing either the WT nsP3 or G32E mutant nsP3 were treated with arsenite and cycloheximide (cf. Fig. 1b) . WT nsP3 remained co-localized with G3BP1, but not with eIF3b. On the contrary, while mutant nsP3 appeared as foci, eIF3b and the majority of G3BP1 did not (Fig. 2c) . Therefore, mutant nsP3/G3BP1/eIF3b foci shared the cycloheximide-sensitive nature of canonical SGs. In addition, G32E expression also resulted in the co-localization of G3BP1 and eIF3b in response to other types of stress such as clotrimazole and thapsigargin (Fig. S2b, c) , suggesting that the observed phenotype is common to multiple stressors that induce SGs.

Given that the SG proteome is comprised of multiple protein-protein interaction networks [54, 55] , we tested whether ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity of nsP3 alters the colocalization of SG components in addition to G3BP1 and eIF3b in cells expressing either WT nsP3 (hydrolase-positive MD) or the G32E mutant (hydrolase-negative MD). The examined SG components included the RNA-binding proteins G3BP2, TIA1, TIAR, FMRP, HuR, and PABPC1, as well as the translation-related proteins eIF3e, eIF3i, eIF3j, eIF4G1 and RACK1, and RPS6 (Fig. 2d , e, and S3). As for G3BP1, WT nsP3 co-localized with all tested RNA-binding proteins in both untreated and arsenitetreated cells. On the other hand, as in the case of eIF3b, none of the translation-related proteins colocalized with WT nsP3 in either condition. However, the nsP3 mutant G32E co-localized with all tested SG components in arsenite-treated, but not untreated, cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the nsP3 ADP-ribosylhydrolyase activity regulate associations between SG components.\n\nTo determine whether the observed role of nsP3 MD ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity during arsenite-induced stress is relevant in a physiological context, we tested whether MD hydrolase mutation affects SG assembly in CHIKV-infected cells. Given that CHIKVs with nsP3 mutations (D10A, G32E, G112E) that severely compromise ADP-ribose binding and hydrolase activities are not viable [38] , we focused on viable CHIKV mutants G32S and Y114A with diminished, but not absent, hydrolase activity.\n\nCHIKV WT and nsP3 mutants were examined 5.5 h after infection when nsP3 appears as foci in the absence of arsenite (Fig. S4a) . To examine the ability of WT, G32S and Y114A nsP3s to suppress SG formation, infected cells were treated with arsenite for 0.5 h (a time point when ~95% of uninfected cells have developed SGs; data not shown). Consistent with experiments using nsP3 protein expression constructs (Fig. 2a, b) , WT CHIKV infection suppressed SG formation, where only 27% of nsP3-positive cells had canonical (G3BP1/eIF3b double-positive) SGs (Fig. 3a, b) .

To test whether these mutant nsP3/eIF3b/G3BP1 foci are sensitive to change in translation similar to SGs, we treated the infected cells with cycloheximide. Similar to the studies expressing nsP3 protein alone ( Fig. 2c) , the translation initiation factor eIF3b was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm rather than in foci (Fig. S4d) . However, mutant nsP3 and G3BP1 remained as foci during viral infection, suggesting that G3BP1 associates with additional viral proteins besides nsP3 in these foci (e.g., [56] ). Taken together, these data suggest that the ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity of nsP3 can alter the association between individual SG components during viral infection.\n\nFormation of aberrant SGs is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) [1, 57] . Genetic mutations are commonly observed in RNA-binding proteins such as FUS (e.g. R495X), and overexpression of some ALS-related mutant RNA-binding proteins results in the formation of aggregates enriched in canonical SG components such as G3BP1 and translation initiation factors [58, 59] . We hypothesized that the formation of FUS R495X-mediated SG-like aggregates might also be suppressed by nsP3 ADPribosylhydrolase activity. We co-transfected FLAG-tagged FUS R495X with either GFP alone, GFPtagged nsP3 WT or GFP-nsP3 G32E into U2OS cells and examined the presence of FUS R495Xinduced aggregates. Consistent with previous reports [48, 49, 60] , overexpression of FUS-R495X itself formed SG-like aggregates, which were positive for G3BP1 and eIF3b, in ~50% of transfected cells (vector, Fig. 3c , e, data not shown). Intriguingly, co-transfection with full-length nsP3 WT, but not the point mutant G32E, decreased formation of these aggregates by two-fold (Fig. 3c, e) . Moreover, the All rights reserved.

Given that the full length nsP3 protein possesses the G3BP-binding HVD, the reduction of SG-like aggregates was accompanied by formation of foci containing both nsP3 and G3BP1 (Fig. 3c) . On the contrary, co-transfection of nsP3 MD alone decreased formation of these aggregates by two-fold without the formation of nsP3/G3BP1 foci (Fig. 3c, e) , further pointing to the importance of the MD ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity.\n\nTo determine whether the ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity can also cause the dissolution of preformed FUS R495X-induced aggregates, we transfected the FUS R495X construct 12 h prior to the nsP3 constructs (Fig. 3d) . As in the case for co-transfection, transfection of WT nsP3 or MD alone, but not G32E nsP3, decreased the number of aggregates by at least 2.5-fold (Fig. 3d-e) . These data suggest that the SG-like aggregates induced by FUS R495X can also be disrupted by nsP3 ADPribosylhydrolase activity.\n\nExpression of FUS R495X in neuronal cells is reported to cause the dispersion of the protein COPBI-the coatomer beta subunit of the coat protein complex I involved in retrograde vesicular trafficking from Golgi and ER [61] . Intriguingly, expression of nsP3 WT, but not the G32E mutant, restored the dispersed pattern of COPBI in FUS R495X-transfected neuronal SH-SY5Y cells to the compact, juxtanuclear pattern observed in untransfected cells (Fig. 3f) . As in U2OS, SG-like aggregates were induced by the expression of FUS R495X in these neuronal cells (Fig. S4e-f) , and the number of aggregates were reduced upon co-transfection with nsP3 WT, but not G32E mutant (Fig. S4e-f ). These data further suggest that the nsP3 ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity restores at least one cellular property disrupted by the FUS R495X mutant in addition to SG disassembly.\n\nAll rights reserved.

We focused on G3BP1 as a candidate because it is a direct binding partner of nsP3 [40, 41, 44, [50] [51] [52] , it is an essential component of SGs formed upon treatment with arsenite, clotrimazole and thapsigargin [10] , it plays a critical role in virus infection [40, 62] , and it is required for the formation of SG-like aggregates associated with ALS [63] [64] [65] . Given that the binding of G3BP1 by the nsP3 HVD is proposed to be critical for SG disassembly [35, 36] and that the ADP-ribosylhydrolase mutant of nsP3 has a decreased ability to suppress SG formation (Fig.   2a ), we next tested whether the observed change in colocalization of SG components is due to the differential ability for nsP3 mutants to bind G3BP1 (Fig. 4a) . GFP-tagged WT or mutants representative of three different classes (G32E, G32S, and Y114A) were transfected into cells, immunoprecipitated and probed for G3BP1. No differences were observed for the G3BP1 association with WT nsP3 and mutants tested, suggesting that ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity does not regulate the association between nsP3 and G3BP1.\n\nBesides binding to nsP3, G3BP1 and its associated proteins are also ADP-ribosylated [19] and, therefore, might be targets of nsP3 ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity. To test this possibility, we expressed GFP-G3BP1 alone or co-expressed it with increasing amounts of FLAG-tagged nsP3. GFP-G3BP1 was then immunoprecipitated and probed for ADP-ribosylation. With GFP-G3BP1 expression alone, a prominent signal of ADP-ribosylation appeared at and above the expected molecular weight of GFP-G3BP1. The signal appeared as a smear because of the heterogeneous number of ADP-ribose units added onto G3BP1 and its associated proteins. Upon co-expression of WT full-length nsP3, the ADPribosylation signal associated with G3BP1 was reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4b) . Such reduction of signals was not observed when the nsP3 G32E mutant was co-expressed (Fig. 4c) , suggesting that the ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity of nsP3 is responsible for reducing ADP-ribosylation associated with the essential SG component G3BP1. \n\nThe presence of microscopically visible SGs is a manifestation of the underlying dynamic equilibrium of factors that control its rates of assembly and disassembly at a sub-microscopic level.\n\nEmergent data indicate that this equilibrium can be altered through post-translational modifications, whereby enzymes with opposing activities that add and remove these modifications regulate the dynamics of SG integrity [20] . Here, we report that the SG integrity is regulated by the MD of alphaviral All rights reserved.

Expression of the wild-type nsP3 MD alone is sufficient to suppress SG formation. The requirement for ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity was demonstrated by the loss of ability to suppress SG formation by five different mutants with impaired enzyme activity. Though it is possible that activities other than ADP-ribosylhydrolase possessed by the nsP3 MD may be responsible for suppressing SG formation, the fact that mutations at different sites in the MD result in the same phenotype make such a scenario less likely. Importantly, the expression of WT nsP3, but not the ADP-ribosylhydrolase-deficient mutant nsP3s, suppresses the formation of SGs in response to multiple types of stress including oxidative stress (arsenite), mitochondrial stress (clotrimazole) and ER stress (thapsigargin). Suppression was observed both by ectopic expression of nsP3 through transfection and natively in the context of CHIKV infection. Given that the MD and its ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity are conserved across all macrodomain-containing RNA viruses [66, 67] , including coronaviruses, it is possible that these viruses suppress SG formation through a common mechanism by removing ADP-ribosylation.\n\nFor alphaviruses, SGs are first induced in the early stage of infection and subsequently disassembled [32, 34] . It was previously proposed that the disassembly is mediated through the sequestration of the essential SG component G3BP1/2 by associating with the C-terminal HVD domain of nsP3 [35, 36, 41] . Though we confirmed the association between nsP3 and G3BP1, our data show that the expression of the HVD domain alone does not suppress SG formation. It is therefore unlikely that nsP3 causes SG disassembly through HVD sequestration of G3BP1/2 alone. Yet, G3BP1/2 and its association with the nsP3 HVD are required for CHIKV replication [40, 62] . We note, however, that the HVD is composed of low-complexity regions [39] , which are increasingly appreciated for their role in mediating the assembly of non-membranous structures [6] [7] [8] . Here, we instead propose a model of how nsP3 mediates SG disassembly, wherein the C-terminal HVD promotes the association between nsP3 and SG proteins so that the N-terminal MD can act locally to remove ADP-ribosylation in SGs. As an increasing amount of nsP3 is expressed over the course of infection, a higher level of ADP-All rights reserved.

It would be of interest to explore whether PAR plays a role in re-assortment of proteins in non-membranous structures in general. Our analyses further revealed that the essential SG component G3BP1 is one of the nsP3 ADP-ribosylhydrolase targets. However, it is unclear whether the observed re-assortment of SG composition is mediated by ADP-ribosylation of G3BP1 and/or other targets within SGs, which warrants further investigation. The observed pattern of specific protein retainment suggests that some protein-protein interaction networks within SGs are mediated by PAR, with the possibility that the ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity of nsP3 actively promotes the release from SGs of translation factors needed for viral protein translation (Fig. 4d) . Such a possibility is consistent with recent data showing that nsP3 ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity is critical for switching from host translation to translation of the viral structural proteins during the later stages of viral replication [68, 69] .

Compared with other protein modifications that regulate SG dynamics, ADP-ribosylation is unique in that the polymeric form (i.e., PAR) is able to seed the low-complexity region-containing proteins to form non-membranous structures in vitro [25] [26] [27] [28] 70] . Our data suggest that the nsP3 ADP-ribosylhydrolase likely degrades the PAR that seeds SGs in cells, with G3BP1 as a possible ADP-ribosylated substrate (cf. Fig. 4b, c) . The complete removal of PAR from ADP-ribosylated proteins requires two steps: the degradation of the polymeric chain down to single ADP-ribose units conjugated to proteins, followed by the hydrolysis of the final, proximal ADP-ribose groups from proteins [73] [74] [75] . The alphaviral nsP3 MD alone efficiently hydrolyzes single ADP-ribose groups from ADP-ribosylated proteins in vitro but inefficiently removes the PAR chains [38, 45] . However, it is possible that the nsP3 MD may partner with other protein(s) to process the PAR chains in cells. For example, the hepatitis E viral MD hydrolyzes PARylated proteins efficiently in vitro through association with another viral protein that possesses helicase activities [47] . Notably, several host helicases associate with alphaviral nsP3 in infected cells [39] , and future experiments will help address whether or not any of them are involved in partnering with nsP3 to remove PAR.\n\nAlternatively, our previous studies identified PARG-an endogenous enzyme that cleaves the riboseribose bonds between ADP-ribose units-as localized in SGs, where its expression level controls the assembly and disassembly of SGs [19] . Therefore, another model is that PARG mediates the breakdown of PAR in SGs, followed by nsP3 ADP-ribosylhydrolase providing the critical step to completely remove the final ADP-ribose from modified proteins.

Preclinical studies showed that PARP inhibitors reduce the number of non-membranous pathological aggregates in models of neurodegenerative disease [26, 30, 76] and PARG knockout flies revealed progressive neurodegeneration with observable cytoplasmic aggregates [77] . Consistent with these findings, our data showed that expression of wild-type nsP3, but not an ADP-ribosylhydrolase-deficient nsP3 mutant, can reduce the number of SG-like aggregates formed upon expression of the FUS protein mutant R495X, which is linked to an aggressive form of ALS. These data altogether suggest possible therapeutic options for reduction of non-membranous protein aggregates by lowering PAR levels, either through inhibiting PARP or increasing the ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity.
