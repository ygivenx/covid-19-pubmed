{"title": "Candidate new rotavirus species in Schreiber's bats, Serbia", "body": "Rotaviruses (RVs, family Reoviridae, genus Rotavirus) are a major cause of acute diarrhea in mammals and birds. At present, eight recognized and one proposed rotavirus species (RVA to RVH and RVI, respectively) are distinguished. Among these, RVA to RVC, RVE, RVH and RVI are known to infect mammals and RVA is the most widespread species in most, if not all, mammalian hosts (Estes and Greenberg, 2013; Matthijnssens et al., 2012; Mihalov-Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2015) .\n\nBatborne RVs described so far belong almost exclusively to RVA; sequence analysis of the identified strains uncovered some intriguing details concerning the ecology and evolution of batborne RVAs. For example, a bat strain from Kenya had an unusual VP1 gene and the hypothesis arose that during their evolution mammalian RVs belonging to different RV species may share genes by reassortment (Esona et al., 2010) . Furthermore, bats seem to serve as reservoirs of multiple RVA genotypes commonly found in heterologous host species. Consequently, batborne RVAs might pose some veterinary and public health risk (Asano et al., 2016; He et al., 2013; Xia et al., 2014) . More recent data indicate that in addition to RVA, RVH may also infect bats (Kim et al., 2016) .\n\nAmong bats, Schreiber's bat (Miniopterus schreibersii) represents one of the most widespread species complex in the world, living in large colonies. Schreiber's bats are distributed in distinct lineages throughout Oceania, Africa, Southern Europe and South-East Asia (Appleton et al., 2004) . Colonies of M. schreibersii are usually large and dense so that members of the colony can save energy during the hibernation period. These bats may roost together with Rhinolophus ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus euryale, Myotis myotis, Myotis blythii, and Myotis emarginatus. M. schreibersii is able to fly large distances (N500 km) from one roost to another (Hutterer et al., 2005) . Overall, these colonial and behavioral characteristics of M. schreibersii may notably influence pathogen dissemination that could lead to high prevalence and maintenance of viruses within colonies (Kemenesi et al., 2014) .\n\nOur recent pilot study on fecal virome analysis of the Hungarian bat fauna provided new insight into viral diversity, providing evidence of novel astroviruses and bufaviruses in M. schreibersii (Kemenesi et al., 2014 (Kemenesi et al., , 2015 . To further explore the ecological role of these common bats as virus reservoirs we involved additional geographical locations in our surveys. While we were prepared that new virus diversity may be explored by the method of viral metagenomics, we unexpectedly, identified sequence traces of a novel rotavirus in multiple samples. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome sequence of a selected rotavirus strain provided evidence of a candidate new rotavirus species in these bats.\n\nBat guano samples were collected on October 3rd 2014 at cave Pionirska pe\u0107ina (Beljanica Mt., Serbia; 44\u00b04\u2032 N, 21\u00b038\u2032 E) during regular bat-ringing activities by experienced chiropterologists (under a license provided by the Ministry of Energetics, Development, and Environmental Protection of the Republic of Serbia, license number: 353-01-2660/2013-08). A mist-net (7 \u00d7 2.5 m) was set up at the cave entrance before sunset and remained open until 2 a.m. The trapped bat specimens were removed immediately, identified following Dietz et al. (2009) and held individually in perforated disposable paper bags for maximum of 30 min in order to let them defecate. After collecting fecal samples, bats were aged, sexed, measured, banded and released. A total of 128 Miniopterus schreibersii were captured (45 males and 83 females), and fecal samples were collected from ten specimens (3 males and 7 females). Droppings were stored in RNAlater RNA Stabilization Reagent (QIAGEN) and kept on ice until laboratory processing.\n\nGuano samples were homogenized in 500 \u03bcL phosphate buffered saline. After 5 min centrifugation in 10,000 \u00d7g, 200 \u03bcL of the supernatant was used for nucleic acid extraction, performed with GeneJet Viral DNA and RNA Purification Kit (Thermo Scientific Ltd.), following the manufacturers recommendations. Nucleic acid samples were previously denatured at 97\u00b0C for 5 min in the presence of 10 \u03bcM random hexamer tailed by a common PCR primer sequence (Djikeng et al., 2008) . Reverse transcription was performed with 1 U AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega), 400 \u03bcM dNTP mixture, and 1\u00d7 AMV RT buffer (composition at 1 \u00d7 concentration; 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.3], 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM spermidine and 10 mM DTT) at 42\u00b0C for 45 min following a 5 min incubation at room temperature. Then, 5 \u03bcL cDNA was added to 45 \u03bcL PCR mixture to obtain a final volume of 50 \u03bcL and a concentration of 500 \u03bcM for the PCR primer (Djikeng et al., 2008) , 200 \u03bcM for dNTP mixture, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 \u00d7 Taq DNA polymerase buffer, and 0.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific). The reaction conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of amplification (95\u00b0C for 30 s, 48\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 2 min) and terminated at 72\u00b0C for 8 min. 0.1 \u03bcg of cDNA was subjected to enzymatic fragmentation and adaptor ligation following the manufacturers recommendations (available at www.neb.com; NEBNext\u00ae Fast DNA Fragmentation & Library Prep Set for Ion Torrent\u2122 kit, New England Biolabs). The barcoded adaptors were retrieved from the KAPA Adaptor Kits for Ion Torrent Platforms (Kapa Biosystems). The resulting cDNA libraries were measured on a Qubit\u00ae 2.0 equipment using the Qubit\u00ae dsDNA BR Assay kit (Invitrogen). The emulsion PCR that produced clonally amplified libraries was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol using the Ion PGM Template kit on an OneTouch v2 instrument (Life Technologies). Enrichment of the templated beads (on an Ion One Touch ES machine, Life Technologies) and further steps of pre-sequencing set-up were performed according to the 200 bp protocol of the manufacturer. The sequencing protocol recommended for Ion Torrent PGM Sequencing Kit on a 316 chip was strictly followed (Life Technologies).\n\nTo obtain the true sequence of the genome segment ends, a short oligonucleotide (PC3-mod), phosphorylated at the 5\u2032 end and blocked at the 3\u2032 end with dideoxy cytosine, was ligated to the 3\u2032 ends of the genomic RNA in the nucleic acid extract (Lambden et al., 1992; Potgieter et al., 2002) . In brief, 5 \u03bcL total RNA was combined with 25 \u03bcL RNA ligation mixture (consisting of 3.5 \u03bcL nuclease free water, 2 \u03bcL of 20 \u03bcM PC3, 12.5 \u03bcL of 34% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 3 \u03bcL of 10 mM ATP, 3 \u03bcL 10\u00d7 T4 RNA Ligase buffer and 10 U T4 RNA Ligase I (New England Biolabs) and then incubated at 17\u00b0C for 16 h. Following the incubation, the RNA was extracted using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN). Binding of RNA to silica-gel column was performed in the presence of 150 \u03bcL QG buffer from the extraction kit and 180 \u03bcL isopropanol. All subsequent steps were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nFive microliter ligated RNA was heat-denatured in the presence of 1 \u03bcL of 20 \u03bcM primer (PC2-mod, which is complementary to the PC3mod oligonucleotide ligated to the 3\u2032 end) at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and then placed on ice slurry. The reverse transcription mixture contained 14 \u03bcL nuclease free water, 6 \u03bcL 5\u00d7 First Strand Buffer, 1 \u03bcL of 10 \u03bcM dNTP mixture, 1 \u03bcL 0.1 M DTT, 20 U RiboLock RNase Inhibitor (Thermo Scientific) and 300 U SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). This mixture was added to the denatured ligated RNA and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 5 min and then 50\u00b0C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped at 70\u00b0C for 15 min.\n\nSubsequently, 2 \u03bcL cDNA was added to the PCR mixture, which consisted of 17 \u03bcL nuclease free water, 1 \u03bcL of 10 \u03bcM dNTP mixture, 2.5 \u03bcL 10\u00d7 DreamTaq Green Buffer (including 20 mM MgCl 2 ), and 2 \u03bcL of 20 \u03bcM primer pair (i.e. 1 \u03bcL PC2 and 1 \u03bcL gene-specific primer; see Table 1 ) and 2.5 U DreamTaq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific). Gene-specific primers were designed on the basis of preliminary sequence data obtained by semiconductor sequencing. The thermal profile consisted of the following steps: 95\u00b0C 3 min, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C 30 s, 42\u00b0C 30 s, 72\u00b0C 2 min, final elongation at 72\u00b0C for 8 min. The PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and bands of the expected sizes were excised and cleaned up with Geneaid Gel/PCR DNA fragments Extraction Kit (Geneaid).\n\nAmplicons were subjected to Sanger sequencing with the PCR primers using the BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). Ethanol precipitated products were run on an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer.\n\nThe genome segments encoding NSP1 and NSP5 of RV strains belonging to various RV species may be either mono-, bi-or tricistronic. To validate the results obtained by semiconductor sequencing we performed traditional sequencing. In brief, cDNA production, amplification and Sanger sequencing were carried out with sequence specific primers (Table 1 ) designed based on the Ion Torrent sequence reads. The experimental protocol was essentially the same as described in the previous section describing the method for determination of genome segment termini.\n\nStool samples were homogenized in 500 \u03bcL PBS. Following a centrifugation step at 10000 \u00d7 g for 5 min, the viral RNA was extracted from 200 \u03bcL of supernatants using GeneJET Viral DNA and RNA Purification Kit (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Genomic RNA was heat-denaturated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min in the presence of 10 \u03bcM gene specific primers. Nested RT-PCR amplification was performed with newly designed primers directed to a 338 nt fragment in the RV VP6 protein region (Table 1) . To obtain first round PCR product, 5 \u03bcL of the heat-denaturated RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using QIAGEN One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen) in a 25 \u03bcL final reaction volume. The reaction was performed at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by an initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 min, and then by 40 cycles of amplification (each cycle included a denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, an annealing step at 42\u00b0C for 30 s, and extension step at 72\u00b0C for 1 min). Nested PCR was carried out with the GoTaq DNA Polymerase (Promega). In brief, 3 \u03bcL of the first round PCR products were amplified with inner primers for 35 cycles under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of amplification (denaturation, 94\u00b0C, 30 s; annealing, 50\u00b0C, 45 s; extension, 72\u00b0C, 1 min). Second round PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel in TBE buffer stained with GelGreen and then sequenced in both directions using the protocol referred in previous sections.\n\nFor viral metagenomics, raw sequence reads were trimmed and quality controlled using CLC Genomics Workbench (version 9.0; http://www.clcbio.com). The minimal read length parameter was set to 35. Trimmed reads were taxonomically binned using Diamond v0.8.3 versus NCBI-NR (Buchfink et al., 2015) . After classification, the output files were analyzed and visualized by MEGAN6 Ultimate Edition (Huson et al., 2016) .\n\nThe CLC Genomics Workbench software package was utilized to assemble the genome sequence. After visual inspection of sequence mappings a single consensus sequence was created for all 11 genome segments. Further sequence editing and evaluation were carried out by the GeneDoc (Nicholas et al., 1997) and BioEdit software (Hall, 1999) and then analyzed by similarity search using BLAST (Altschul et Fw  CTG CTG AAA CAA TCT TTA AGT GCA A  270  Fw  GGA TTG ACT GGT TCA GAA CTA AGG TAT TA  412  Rev  TCT CTT CGA TGA TTT GAG ATG GAG  198  Rev  TCG TCG CAT TCA TTG GAT GTT TTA A  367  VP2  Fw  GAT GGC GCA GAC TTC GGT ATA C  233  Fw  CTC GAT GCA CAG AGA TTA CTC GTC  208  Rev  GAT TTA ACT AAC CGA AGC AAT TCC TTG TA  204  Rev  CTG TTT CTG CTT TTG TTG AGT CTC ATT TC  280  VP3  Fw  ATG TCT CCG TTT AGA TGG ATA CAG C  229  Fw  AAG AGA TAA TTT CGC CGG GTA CTC  302  Rev  TCA ATC GTA ACG TAG AAT GTC TGC TGC al., 1990). Multiple alignments were prepared using the TranslatorX online program (Abascal et al., 2010) and manually adjusted in the GeneDoc software (Nicholas et al., 1997) , whereas phylogenetic analysis by the maximum-likelihood and the neighbor-joining methods were performed by using the MEGA6 software (Tamura et al., 2013) . For the maximum-likelihood tree the best fit nucleotide substitution models for each gene were selected based on the Bayesian information criterion as implemented in the MEGA software (in particular, TN93 + G was used for NSP3; HKY + G was used for NSP1, NSP4 and NSP5; GTR + G was used for NSP2, VP1, VP2, VP4, VP6, and VP7; GTR + G + I was used for VP3). For the neighbor-joining tree we used the p-distance algorithm.\n\nThe coding potential was predicted by using the ORF Finder online platform (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html).\n\nThe whole genome sequence of strain RVJ/Bat-wt/SRB/BO4351/Ms/ 2014/G1P1 has been deposited under the following accession numbers: KX756619-KX756629.\n\nTo explore the viral diversity six fecal specimens collected from apparently healthy adult M. schreibersii bats were processed for viral metagenomics. In these samples various amounts of sequence reads mapped onto known eukaryotic viral sequences (range, \u226a 0.1% to 0.9%; Fig. 1 ). When evaluating the results of viral metagenomics data we need to point out that sample processing did not include virion enrichment step and it is not clear whether each of the relevant sequence reads originate from intact virions. Consequently, the presence of potential endogenous viral sequence elements may have affected the overall landscape of viral diversity. For example retrovirus specific reads, which may represent endogenous viral genomic traits from genomic DNA of the host species, were detected in all samples. Overall the rate of eukaryotic virus specific sequence reads was low, likely because we omitted virus particle enrichment procedures in our sample processing protocol. Nonetheless, various eukaryotic viruses were detected in all six selected fecal samples. Herpesvirus, astrovirus and coronavirus sequences were detected in at least three samples (herpesvirus in sample 1, 3, and 4; astrovirus in sample 1 to 3; coronavirus in sample 4 to 6). Rotavirus and gemycircularvirus sequences were found in two and one samples, respectively (both viruses in sample 1; rotavirus without gemycircularvirus in sample 6). In one specimen (i.e. sample 6) RV sequences were the most abundant genomic representatives (98.5%); however, these sequence reads were distributed among various RV species (incl. RVB, RVG, RVH and RVI). To clarify this ambiguous situation, the library DNA that contained the most abundant RV-specific reads was resequenced at a greater sequencing depth. The resulting N 1.3 Million sequence reads were subjected to de novo assembly.\n\nAs a result, the consensus genome sequence of strain BO4351/Ms/ 2014 could be assembled from a total of 36,630 sequence reads at 131 X (segment 3) to 457 X (segment 11) average coverage. Once the consensus rotavirus gene sequences were assembled for all 11 genomic segments, the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of each segment were validated by an independent method. The resulting genome of BO4351/Ms/2014 was 18,135 bp in length (range, 3533 bp for segment 1 and 620 bp for segment 11). Terminal sequences at the 5\u2032 ends showed relatively conserved structure with stable nucleotides at positions 1, 2 and 4 and some variations at positions 3, 5, and 6 (segments 1 and 2, GGCACA; segments 3 and 4, GGCATT; segments 5, 7 and 9, GGAAAT; segments 6 and 10, GGCAAA), while at the 3\u2032 ends the variation was less (TAYACCC) (see details in Table 2) .\n\nEach segment had non-translated regions at both 5\u2032 end (length range, 6 to 57 nt) and 3\u2032 end (length range, 20 to 84 nt). Encoded proteins were assigned based on significant hits through the Blast engine and conserved peptide motifs. With this approach we found the equivalents of the major structural (VP1 to VP4, VP6 and VP7) and non-structural (NSP1 to NSP5) proteins of RVs (Tables 2 and 3 ). The encoded structural and non-structural proteins were assigned to particular RNA segments based on the size of full-length genome segments. Additional putative ORFs were predicted to be encoded on segments coding for VP6 and NSP5; however, these putative proteins shared no conserved protein motifs with those of known from other rotavirus species.\n\nIn the phylogenetic analyses cognate sequences of representative RVA to RVH strains were included, except for RVE, for which no sequence information is available. Neighbor-joining and maximum-likelihood trees provided similar topologies, clearly distinguishing clade 1 and clade 2 RV strains. The novel batborne RV consistently clustered with clade 2 RV strains, and in particular, with porcine and human RVH strains. One exception was found when analyzing the NSP4 tree, where the limited bootstrap support at the deepest nodes prevented the separation of the two major RV clades (Fig. 2) . Consistent with the phylogenetic analyses, the greatest nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities for the novel batborne RV were seen when compared to reference RVH strains (range, 41 (nt%) and 14 (aa%) for NSP4; 63 (nt%) and 64 (aa%) for VP1) (Table 4) .\n\nTo place the novel batborne strain, BO4351/Ms/2014, into the latest RV taxonomic framework (Matthijnssens et al., 2012;  http://www. ictvonline.org), additional VP6 gene sequences were selected from GenBank to represent a broader genetic diversity of various RV species (Fig. 3) . In this analysis, again, BO4351/Ms/2014 was most closely related to the major genetic lineage containing RVH strains (49-50%, aa) and showed lower similarity to other clade 2 RVs (RVB, 39%, RVG, 39%). The genetic relationship of BO4351/Ms/2014 to clade 1 RVs was marginal (max. identity with RVC, 17%) (Fig. 4, Table 4 ). Thus, applying the official species demarcation sequence cut-off value, which is 53% identity at the amino acid level, we conclude that the novel batborne RV strain represents a new RV species, tentatively called Rotavirus J (RVJ). The reference strain was therefore designated as RVJ/Bat-wt/SRB/BO4351/Ms/ 2014/G1P1.\n\nTo determine whether RVJ infection was common among M. schreibersii in the cave under investigation, a nested PCR assay was developed targeting a sequence region that is conserved within the VP6 coding gene of both RVH and RVJ. By adapting the nested PCR assay that amplified a 338 bp long fragment (spanning nucleotide position 137 to 474), another four stool samples were found to be positive for RVJ. All PCR products obtained in the 2nd round PCR were bidirectionally sequenced. The low sequence variation within these short segments (data not shown) suggested the presence of the same virus strain within the colony. Notably, given that RVs have been detected exclusively in birds and mammals, the data presented here suggests that bats may be a true host species of RVJ, although further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. It is important to note that by morphological examination all tested animals were confirmed as adult specimens. Immune competence and pathogenicity need to be clarified for most viruses harbored by bats, although asymptomatic virus shedding seems to be common. Further studies are needed to clarify the pathogenicity, prevalence and effect of the virus on bat colonies. Since bats seems to possess special immune characteristics , these features may contribute to an altered response to rotavirus infection and explain the high rate of fecal virus shedding in adult M. schreibersii specimens.\n\nRecent years have witnessed considerable sequence data accumulation in public data bases pointing out the enormous genetic diversity within the Rotavirus genus. Viral metagenomics largely contributed to our understanding of this genetic diversity (Asano et al., 2016; He et al., 2013; Kluge et al., 2016; Li et al., 2011; Marton et al., 2015; Mihalov-Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2015; Theuns et al., 2016; Xia et al., 2014) . Until the early 2000s RVA to RVG were considered as the only extant RV species (Estes and Greenberg, 2013; Matthijnssens et al., 2012) . Sequence independent amplification followed by cloning and sequencing led to the discovery of a novel human RV species that, together with closely related porcine origin strains, was classified into RVH (Matthijnssens et al., 2012; Wakuda et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2004) . A newly described member of the Rotavirus genus, RVI, was identified in the fecal viromes of seals and dogs (Li et al., 2011; Mihalov-Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2015) .\n\nIn this study we described a novel RV detected in M. schreibersii bats from Serbia in 2014. This novel batborne RV belongs to clade 2 RVs, which also includes RVB, RVG, RVH and RVI (Kindler et al., 2013; Mihalov-Kov\u00e1cs et al., 2015) . Of interest, the novel strain was closely related to representative strains of RVH suggesting that these RVs had diverged from a common ancestor. Nonetheless, molecular classification indicated that the Serbian batborne RV strain could be the member of Fig. 2 . Phylogenetic trees obtained for the genes encoding all major structural proteins (VP1 to VP4, VP6, and VP7) and non-structural proteins (NSP1 to NSP5) with representative strains of RVA to RVI. Alignments were created using the TranslatorX online platform (http://translatorx.co.uk/). Phylogenetic trees were prepared using the maximum likelihood method as implemented in Mega6 (http://www.megasoftware.net/). Bootstrap values are shown at the branch nodes. Calibration bars are proportional to the genetic distance.\n\nPercentile nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) sequence based identities between the novel batborne RV strain, BO4351/Ms/2014, and reference RVA-RVD and RVF-RVI strains. a novel RV species that we propose here as Rotavirus J. New sequence information of the complete RVJ genome should enable the design of sophisticated nucleic acid based diagnostic assays and the production of recombinant protein for serological assays that will help describe further details about the ecology, epizootiology and evolution of the novel RV. Of particular interest, given that many batborne viruses are capable of causing severe disease in humans it will be important to study whether or not the novel RVJ strains pose any occupational risk for professional chiropterologists or individuals coming into contact with bats and their excreta.
