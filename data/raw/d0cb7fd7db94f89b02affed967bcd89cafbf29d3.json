{"title": "", "body": "The child was seen daily at the out patient clinic and the symptoms gradually decreased. A nasopharyngeal aspirate was collected 5 days after the onset of symptoms. The specimen was tested for the presence of RSV, adenovirus, influenza A and B virus, and parainfluenza virus type 1, 2 and 3 using the Virus Respiratory Kit (Bartels: Trinity Biotech plc, Wicklow Ireland). In addition, PCR tests for rhinoviruses, enterovirus, meta-pneumovirus and HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E were performed 1,2 . The original nasopharyngeal aspirate was inoculated onto a variety of cells. The cultures were kept in a rollerdrum at 34\u00b0C and inspected by eye every 3 to 4 days. Maintenance medium was replenished every 3 to 4 days.\n\nTwo different types of medium were used: Optimem 1 (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands) without bovine fetal serum was used for the tMK cells, and MEM Hanks' /Earle's medium (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands) with 3% bovine fetal serum for the remaining cell types.\n\nCell cultures that were infected with the aspirate specimen were stained for the presence of \n\nThe cDNA library was generated as described by Marra et al 3 with minor modifications.\n\nRandom hexamer primers instead of the oligo-dT primer were used for reverse transcription, and the amplified cDNA was cloned into the PCR2.1-TOPO TA cloning vector. Colonies were picked and suspended in Brain Heart Infusion medium. The E. coli suspension was used as input in PCR amplification with T7 and M13 RP primers. The PCR products were subsequently sequenced with the same primers and the BigDye terminator reagent.\n\nElectrophoresis and data collection was performed on an ABI 377 instrument. Sequences were assembled using the AutoAssembler DNA sequence Assembly software version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Nieuwerkerk aan de IJssel, The Netherlands).\n\nSequences were compared to all sequences in the GenBank database using the BLAST tool of the NCBI webpage: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast. For phylogenetic analysis the sequences were aligned using the ClustalX software package with the following settings: Gap opening penalties:10.00; Gap extension penalty 0.20; Delay divergent sequences switch at 30% and transition weight 0.5 4 . Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the neighbourjoining method of the MEGA program. The nucleotide distance matrix was generated either by Kimura's 2 parameter estimation or by the p-distance estimation 5 . Bootstrap resampling (500 replicates) was employed to place approximate confidence limits on individual branches."}
