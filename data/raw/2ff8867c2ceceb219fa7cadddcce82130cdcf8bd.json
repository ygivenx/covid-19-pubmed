{"title": "Journal Pre-proof COVID-19 Infection in Cancer Patients: Early Observations and Unanswered Questions", "body": ". This report provides a first estimate of the probability of dying in infected cancer patients, with a mortality rate (28.6%) that is more than ten times higher than that reported in all COVID-19 patients in China [4] . In addition, Zhang and colleagues identified that the recent use of anticancer therapies within 14 days of infection (including chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiation) was an independent predictor of death or other severe events with a hazard ratio of greater than 4. Another important and novel finding was the high proportion of patients who acquired the infection while already in the hospital for cancer treatment (28.6%), which may account for some of the excess prevalence of infection in this cohort.\n\nWhile these sobering numbers are cause for serious concern for cancer patients, caution is needed in the interpretation of these findings: this series of patients is small, and the data collected retrospectively. The cohort was limited to the most severe cases, defined as requiring admission to an intensive care unit, the use of mechanical ventilation or death. In addition, extrapolation to other countries may be problematic for several reasons: first, the prevalence of cancers in China [3] differ compared with Europe or North America; eight of 28 cases were cancers of the esophagus, liver, stomach or nasopharynx, which are relatively rarer in other regions. In addition, no patients with hematologic malignancies are reported; such patients may have even greater immune suppression than solid tumor patients. Second, the high proportion of patients in this series receiving standard cancer therapy in the hospital for solid tumors may not mimic clinical practice in the US and elsewhere, where most standard treatments occur in outpatient settings. The hospitals involved in this study were also COVID-19 referral centers, which may have led to more critically ill patients at these centers than elsewhere. Finally, severe complications and mortality from COVID-19 may be higher in some European countries, such as Italy and Spain, compared with China for reasons that remain unclear.\n\nDespite these limitations, this early report by Zhang and colleagues represents an important preliminary contribution to our understanding of the risk and effects of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients, and may allow oncologists to tailor clinical management of COVID-19 to our patients. At the very least, cancer patients must practice social distancing or isolation and be candidates for early and rapid evaluation for symptoms suspicious for COVID-19, including testing for virus and chest radiography.\n\nWe expect that in the months to come, more detailed studies will be forthcoming on the impact of COVID-19 infection in cancer patients, including the risk of infection, the clinical impact of COVID-19 and concurrent cancer, the effect on different types of cancer, and the ability to deliver appropriate and even curative cancer treatments in the setting of infection.\n\nFor now, many questions remain unanswered: Should cancer treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy be delayed or modified? Should cancer patients undergo a differential screening process for COVID-19 infection, compared with the general population? How can we reduce the rate of nosocomial infections?\n\nFinally, we will need to understand the heterogeneity in effectiveness of what we hope are soon-to-be approved COVID-19 vaccines and antiviral agents in cancer patients, and that COVID-19 infection will become just one additional factor to take into consideration in the comprehensive management of oncology patients.\n\nNo funding was provided for this manuscript.\n\nFinancial disclosure Nothing to disclose."}
