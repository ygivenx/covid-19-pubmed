{"title": "Ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a for severe Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection: a retrospective cohort study", "body": "Since it was fi rst described in September, 2012, 855 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection have been confi rmed, 333 of which were fatal. 1,2 Cases occur sporadically, as community clusters or as hospital outbreaks, and range in severity from asymptomatic or mild illness to rapidly progressive and fatal disease. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] The management of patients with MERS-CoV infection consists of a combination of supportive measures, antimicrobial therapy for any associated bacterial or viral infections, and strict implementation of appropriate infection control precautions. 7 So far, no antiviral therapy has been approved for the treatment of patients with MERS-CoV infection. 8 Several therapeutic interventions for coronavirus were investigated during the large multinational outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. 9, 10 Reviews of the available scientifi c literature suggest that a combination of ribavirin and interferon might be of benefi t in patients with severe MERS-CoV infection. 8, 11, 12 Furthermore, this combination was shown to inhibit MERS-CoV in cell culture and seemed to improve outcomes in an animal study. 13, 14 Both agents are associated with substantial potential adverse eff ects and hence their clinical use should be carefully balanced against any potential harm. 8 We aimed to assess outcomes of a treatment programme for patients with severe MERS-CoV infection that consisted of oral ribavirin and subcutaneous pegylated interferon alfa-2a. We report the results and outcomes in patients given treatment in accordance with this protocol by comparison with a historical group who received supportive therapy only.\n\nThis single-centre, retrospective cohort study included individuals who were diagnosed with laboratoryconfi rmed MERS-CoV infection between Oct 23, 2012, and May 1, 2014, at the Prince Sultan Military Medical City (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). Eligible patients were those aged 16 years or older with severe pneumonia needing invasive or non-invasive ventilation. No exclusion criteria were applied at this stage.\n\nMERS-CoV infection was diagnosed by RT-PCR testing of respiratory tract samples for MERS-CoV upE, ORF 1b, and N genes. 15 All RT-PCR tests for MERS-CoV were done at the Saudi Ministry of Health Regional Laboratory in Jeddah and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Pneumonia was defi ned as new, otherwise unexplained, lower respiratory tract symptoms such as cough or shortness of breath with at least one systemic feature such as fever or chills, and new focal chest signs on examination, in addition to new or progressive pulmonary infi ltrates on chest radiograph. 16 From Sept 16, 2013, all eligible patients were off ered treatment with oral ribavirin and subcutaneous pegylated interferon alfa-2a after informed written consent had been obtained from the patients themselves or their next of kin. The treatment protocol was approved by Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the Prince Sultan Military Medical City to allow retrospective access to patients' records and fi les.\n\nPegylated interferon alfa-2a (Pegasys; Roche Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland) was given by subcutaneous injection at a dose of 180 \u03bcg per week for 2 weeks. The dose of oral ribavirin (Copegus; Roche Pharmaceuticals) was adjusted according to calculated creatinine clearance and continued for 8-10 days. 12 Patients with a creatinine clearance of greater than 0\u00b7833 mL/sec/m 2 received a 2000 mg loading dose, followed by 1200 mg every 8 h for 4 days then 600 mg every 8 h for 4-6 days; those with a creatinine clearance of 0\u00b7333-0\u00b7833 mL/sec/m\u00b2 received a 2000 mg loading dose, followed by 600 mg every 8 h for 4 days then 200 mg every 6 h for 4-6 days; and those with a creatinine clearance of <0\u00b7333 mL/sec/m\u00b2 or on dialysis received a 2000 mg loading dose, followed by 200 mg every 6 h for 4 days then 200 mg every 12 h for 4-6 days. Patients did not receive ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a therapy if they were diagnosed before Sept 16, 2013, or if they declined consent. All patients received appropriate supportive care such as supplementary oxygen, vasopressor therapy, and renal replacement as needed. Hydrocortisone 200 mg daily was given to patients with refractory septic shock and continued until vasopressor therapy was no longer needed. 17 In addition to regular clinical monitoring, renal function, liver enzymes, and blood count were assessed at baseline and daily throughout the treatment course. Conscious patients were monitored for any clinical signs of depression or acute confusion.\n\nPatients who received ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a therapy were classifi ed as being in the treatment group and those who did not made up the comparator group. Two investigators, ASO and KB, both of whom were masked to group allocation and the patients' clinical outcomes, compared baseline characteristics of the two groups.

The primary endpoints for the study were 14-day and 28-day survival from the date of MERS-CoV infection was diagnosis.\n\nWe used \u03c7\u00b2 and Fischer's exact tests for categorical variables, whereas we used the student's t test for continuous variables to assess the diff erences in means of the two groups. The log-rank test was used for assessing survival diff erences between the two groups. Our cutoff for statistical signifi cance was 0\u00b705. The graphical and statistical tests suggested that the pro portionalhazard assumption was not violated. We did statistical analyses using Microsoft Excel 2011 and Stata Statistical Software, Release 12.\n\nNo external funding was received for this study. ZM had full access to all the data in the study and had fi nal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\n70 individuals were diagnosed with MERS-CoV infection between Oct 23, 2012, and May 1, 2014. Baseline characteristics were generally similar between patients who received ribavirin and interferon alfa-2a therapy and those who did not (table 1) , with the exception that end-stage renal failure was present in three patients who did not receive study treatment and in none who did. After excluding ineligible patients, 44 patients were included in the study: 20 in the treatment group and 24 in the comparator group (fi gure 1). The mean age of all 44 patients was 65\u00b75 years (SD 18\u00b72), and 32 (73%) were men (table 1) Mean absolute neutrophil count was signifi cantly lower in the treatment group than in the comparator group (table 1) ; however, no other statistically signifi cant differences in baseline characteristics or support measures were noted between the two groups (tables 1, 2).\n\nOf all 44 patients, 21 (48%) were still alive 14 days after diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection, whereas at 28 days only ten (23%) had survived. 14 (70%) of 20 patients in the treatment group were alive 14 days after diagnosis, compared with seven (29%) of 24 in the comparator group (p=0\u00b7004). However, six (30%) of 20 patients in the treatment group survived up to 28 days from diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection, whereas four (17%) of 24 did in the comparator group (p=0\u00b7054; fi gure 2).\n\nRibavirin and pegylated interferon therapy was well tolerated by the treatment group with no premature discontinuation secondary to adverse eff ects. However, the mean drop in haemoglobin over the treatment course was signifi cantly greater in the treatment group (4\u00b732 g/L [SD 2\u00b747]) than in the comparator group \n\nEff ective treatment interventions for patients with severe MERS-CoV infection are still urgently needed.\n\nIn critically ill patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, our study shows that ribavirin and pegylated interferon alfa-2a therapy is associated with a signifi cant 14-day survival benefi t compared with standard treatment. 28-day survival also seemed to improve with ribavirin and pegylated interferon alfa-2a therapy, but the diff erence between groups was not signifi cant (panel). The loss of a signifi cant survival diff erence over time might be partly explained by most patients in our cohort having several comorbidities with high APACHE II and SOFA scores. Mortality is known to be very high in patients with severe MERS-CoV infection who need critical-care support. 24 Therefore, long-term survival benefi t, if present, might be diffi cult to show in smaller studies. Treatment with ribavirin and interferon was well tolerated in our study. The only adverse event that was signifi cantly worse in the treatment group was mean decrease in haemoglobin (4.32 g/L in the treatment group compared with 2\u00b714 g/L in the comparator group). Anaemia is a well recognised complication of ribavirin therapy and was noted previously in studies investigating the role of ribavirin in the treatment of SARS coronavirus infection. 25, 26 Of note, receipt of packed red blood cells was not signifi cantly diff erent between the treatment and comparator groups in our study. Furthermore, no treatment discontinuations occurred as a result of anaemia. Therefore, the risk of ribavirin-associated anaemia-although substantial and in need of careful monitoring-might not hinder the use of ribavirin for patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, especially if a survival benefi t can be confi rmed. Baseline absolute neutrophil count was signifi cantly lower in the treatment group and therefore a signifi cantly lower minimal absolute neutrophil count during the course of the illness is not surprising.\n\nSeveral investigators showed that interferon \u03b1 has useful in-vitro activity against MERS-CoV. 13, 20, 26 However, when compared with interferon \u03b1 and interferon \u03b3, interferon \u03b2 seems to have the most potent inhibitory in-vitro activity against MERS-CoV. 21 Ribavirin has slight anti-MERS-CoV activity in vitro when used alone or in combination with interferon \u03b1. 13, 22 Mycophenolic acid is another compound that exhibits signifi cant in-vitro activity against MERS-CoV. 21 Of 290 compounds screened, 60 were active in cell culture against MERS-CoV. 23 Although only the combination of interferon \u03b1 plus ribavirin has so far undergone in-vivo assess ment against MERS-CoV, 14 many others are potential candidates for further clinical assessment.\n\nOne of the limitations of our study is its small size. However, only two previous reports of clinical use of ribavirin and interferon for MERS-CoV infection have been published. 18, 19 In a retrospective report, fi ve patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, all of whom had signifi cant comorbidities and needed mechanical ventilation, received a com bination of ribavirin and pegylated interferon alfa-2b a median of 19 days after admission. None of the patients survived and the investigators concluded that late commencement of therapy might not be benefi cial. 18 In another report, 19 a patient with severe MERS-CoV infection received ribavirin and interferon therapy with good clinical response and no signifi cant adverse eff ects. Our study, albeit small, is the largest clinical investigation so far to assess the use of this combination in the treatment of patients with severe MERS-CoV infection. Although baseline characteristics of our treatment and comparator groups seem to be reasonably balanced, substantial diff erences might not be apparent because of the small number of patients in the study.\n\nOur study is also limited by its retrospective, nonrandomised nature. Inevitably, selection and unmeasured confounding bias cannot be completely excluded. Undoubtedly, new interventions should ideally be assessed in randomised, controlled clinical trials. However, such an approach is generally accepted to not always be practically feasible in the context of an emerging and relatively uncommon disease such as MERS-CoV infection. 8 We carefully selected our comparator group, ensuring that the two cohorts were matched as closely as possible in their clinical characteristics and treatment interventions other than the receipt of ribavirin and interferon. We removed three individuals who had outlying baseline serum creatinine from the comparator group to minimise the risk of any spurious conclusions driven by clinical characteristics that might be potentially detrimental to clinical outcome. Clinical outcomes for each individual were masked from investigators who selected patients and did matching assessments. The absence of serial viral load measurement in lower respiratory tract samples in our study makes it impossible to show any association between temporal viral load changes and antiviral therapy. Such measurements should be included in any future clinical studies exploring the therapeutic benefi t of any antiviral intervention for patients with MERS-CoV infection. Severe MERS-CoV is associated with poor overall survival. Treatment with oral ribavirin and subcutaneous pegylated interferon alfa-2a is associated with signifi cantly improved survival at 14 days, but not at 28 days. The combination is associated with signifi cant falls in haemoglobin, but no other signifi cant adverse eff ects were noted. Treatment with ribavirin and pegylated interferon might be considered in patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, provided that adequate monitoring and assessment can be ensured. Further assessment, including in patients with less severe MERS-CoV infection, in appropriately designed randomised trials, is recommended.\n\nThis study was initiated and designed by ASO, MMS, ZAM, and AMA.
