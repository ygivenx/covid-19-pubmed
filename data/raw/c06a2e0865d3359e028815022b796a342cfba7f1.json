{"title": "An orally bioavailable broad-spectrum antiviral inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and multiple 1 endemic, epidemic and bat coronavirus 2 3", "body": "The genetically diverse Orthocoronavirinae (coronavirus, CoV) family circulates 45 in many avian and mammalian species. Phylogenetically, CoVs are divided into 4 46 genera: alpha (group 1), beta (group 2), gamma (group 3) and delta (group 4). Three 47 to determine if NHC would increase the mutation frequency during MERS-CoV infection 156 in human primary human airway epithelial cells (HAE). Using MERS-CoV infected HAE 157 treated with either vehicle or a dose range of NHC or RDV, we show that both drugs 158 reduced virus titers in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A) . We then employed a highly-159 sensitive high-fidelity deep sequencing approach (Primer ID NGS), which uses 160 barcoded degenerate primers and Illumina indexed libraries to determine accurate 161 mutation rates after antiviral treatment on viral RNA production 25 . Using this approach, 162 we analyzed a 538bp region of viral genomic RNA in nonstructural protein 15 (nsp15). 163\n\nThe error rates (#mutations/10,000 bases) in vehicle (0.01) or RDV (0.01) treated 164 cultures were very low. RDV is reported to act via chain termination of nascent viral 165 RNA, and thus the low error rates in RDV-treated cultures are in line with the proposed 166 MOA 26 . In contrast, the error rate was significantly increased in NHC-treated CoV RNA in a dose-dependent manner (10-fold at 10\u00b5M and 5-fold at 1\u00b5M) at both 24 168 and 48hpi (Fig. 4C ). The magnitude of the error rate in NHC-treated cultures correlated 169 with virus titer reduction. At 48hpi the respective error rate and virus titer was 0.015 and 170 3.96E+06 pfu/mL for vehicle treatment, 0.045 and 2.86E+04 pfu/mL with 1\u00b5M NHC; and 171 0.090 and 1.5E+02 pfu/mL 10\u00b5M NHC. Thus, with 1\u00b5M NHC a 3-fold increase in error 172 rate resulted in a 138-fold decrease in virus titer, while with 10\u00b5M NHC a 6-fold increase 173 in error rate resulted in a 26,000-fold decrease in virus titer. 174\n\nWe then examined the mutational spectra induced by NHC, which can be 175 incorporated into viral RNA as a substitution for either cytosine (C) or Uridine (U). RNA-176 mutagenic antivirals may incorporate in both nascent negative and positive sense RNA 177 during genome replication (Fig. 4D) . Adenine-to-guanine (A-to-G) and uracil-to-cytosine 178 (U-to-C) transitions were enriched in MERS-CoV genomic RNA in an NHC dose-179 dependent manner (Fig. 4E) . Collectively, these data used high-fidelity sequence 180 analysis to demonstrate a specific enrichment for A:G and C:U transitions in CoV RNA after NHC treatment of primary HAE cell cultures. 182 183 Therapeutic EIDD-2801 reduces SARS-CoV replication and pathogenesis. 184 hydroxycytidine-5'-isopropyl ester), designed for improved in vivo pharmacokinetics and 187 oral bioavailability in humans and non-human primates 12 . Importantly, the plasma 188 profiles of NHC and EIDD-2801 were similar in mice following oral delivery 12 . We first 189 performed a prophylactic dose escalation study in C57BL/6 mice where we orally 190 administered vehicle (10% PEG, 2.5% Cremophor RH40 in water) or 50, 150 or 500 191 mg/kg EIDD-2801 2hr prior to intranasal infection with 5E+04 PFU of mouse-adapted 192 SARS-CoV (SARS-MA15), and then every 12hr thereafter. Beginning on 3dpi and 193 through the end of the study, body weight loss compared to vehicle treatment was 194 significantly diminished (50mg/kg) or prevented (150, 500mg/kg) with EIDD-2801 195 prophylaxis (P < 0.0001) (Supplemental Figure 2A) . Lung hemorrhage was also 196 significantly reduced 5dpi with 500mg/kg EIDD-2801 treatment (Supplemental Figure  197 2B). Interestingly, there was a dose-dependent reduction in SARS-CoV lung titer 198 (median titers: 50mg/kg = 7E+03 pfu/mL, 150mg/kg = 2.5E+03 pfu/mL, 500mg/kg = 50 199 pfu/mL, vehicle = 6.5E+04 pfu/mL) with significant differences among the vehicle, 150 200 mg/kg (P = 0.03) and 500mg/kg (P = 0.006) groups. Thus, prophylactic orally 201 administered EIDD-2801 was robustly antiviral and able to prevent SARS-CoV 202 replication and disease. 203\n\nSince only the 500mg/kg group significantly diminished weight loss, hemorrhage 204 and reduced lung titer to near undetectable levels, we tested this dose under 205 therapeutic treatment conditions to determine if EIDD-2801 could improve the outcomes 206 of an ongoing CoV infection. As a control, we initiated oral vehicle or EIDD-2801 2hr 207 prior to infection with 1E+04 pfu SARS-MA15. For therapeutic conditions, we initiated 208 EIDD-2801 treatment 12, 24, or 48hr after infection. After initiating treatment, dosing for 209 all groups was performed every 12hr for the duration of the study. Both prophylactic 210 treatment initiated 2hr prior to infection and therapeutic treatment initiated 12hr after 211 infection significantly prevented body weight loss following SARS-CoV infection on 2dpi 212 and thereafter (-2hr: P = 0.0002 to <0.0001; +12hr: P = 0.0289 to <0.0001) (Fig. 5A) . 213\n\nTreatment initiated 24hpi also significantly reduced body weight loss (3-5dpi, P = 0.01 to 214 <0.0001) although not to the same degree as the earlier treatment initiation groups. 215\n\nWhen initiated 48hpi, body weight loss was only different from vehicle on 4dpi (P = 216 initiated up to 24hr after infection mirroring the body weight loss phenotypes (Fig. 5B) . 218\n\nInterestingly, all EIDD-2801 treated mice had significantly reduced viral loads in the 219 lungs even in the +48hr group (Fig. 5C) , which experienced the least protection from 220 body weight loss and lung hemorrhage. We also measured pulmonary function via 221 whole body plethysmography (WPB). In Figure 5D , we show the WBP PenH metric, 222 which is a surrogate marker for bronchoconstriction or pulmonary obstruction 27 , was 223 significantly improved throughout the course of the study if treatment was initiated up to 224 12hr after infection, although the +24hr group showed sporadic improvement as well 225 (Fig. 5D ). Lastly, we blindly evaluated hematoxylin and eosin stained lung tissue 226 sections for histological features of ALI using two different and complementary scoring 227 tools 15 , which show that treatment initiated up to +12hr significantly reduced ALI ( We then evaluated the therapeutic efficacy EIDD-2801 following the promising 245 results of our prophylactic studies. Similar to our SARS-CoV study, EIDD-2801 246 treatment administered before or 12hr after intranasal mouse-adapted MERS-CoV 247 infection (5E+04 PFU) prevented body weight loss from 2 through 6dpi ( Fig. 6A , P = 248 0.02 to <0.0001) and lung hemorrhage on 6dpi (Fig. 6B , P = 0.0004 to < 0.0001), but 249 treatment initiated 24 or 48hr did not offer similar protection. Unlike body weight loss 250 and lung hemorrhage data which varied by treatment initiation time, virus lung titer on 251 6dpi was significantly reduced to the limit of detection in all treatment groups (Fig. 6C , P 252 < 0.0001). Interestingly, when viral genomic RNA was quantified in paired samples of 253 lung tissue, EIDD-2801 significantly reduced levels of viral RNA (P <0.0001 to 0.017) in 254 an initiation time-dependent manner for all groups except for +48hr (Fig. 6D) To study the molecular mechanisms associated with drug performance in vivo, 267 we investigated the correlation between infectious virus production and EIDD-2801-268 mediated mutagenesis of MERS-CoV RNA under therapeutic treatment conditions. 269\n\nUsing Primer ID NGS, we measured the mutation rates of both viral genomic RNA (i.e. indicating that neither vehicle nor drug treatment significantly affected the levels of or 278 mutated ISG15 mRNA transcripts (Fig. 6G ). Similar to our TCS data in Figure 6G , the 279 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

In addition, nucleotide transitions 284 observed in MERS-CoV genomes in vitro (i.e. C to U transitions, Fig. 3 ), were also 285 observed in vivo in groups where treatment was initiated prior to and up to 12hr post 286 infection (P = 0.0003 to < 0.0001) (Fig. 5I) . Importantly, these transitions were not 287 observed in host ISG15 mRNA (Fig. 5I) compressed as compared to that in humans. While SARS-and MERS-CoV lung titers 325 peak on 2dpi in mice concurrent with the onset of clinical signs and notable damage to 326 the lung epithelium, in humans this occurs 7-10 days after the onset of 327 symptoms 16,28,36,37 . Thus, in mice, the window within which to treat emerging CoV 328 infection prior to peak replication is compressed (e.g., 24-48hr) but should be much 329 longer in humans. Although speculative, the SARS-and MERS-CoV in vivo data 330 provided herein suggest that 2019-nCoV will prove highly vulnerable to NHC treatment 331 modalities in vivo, critical experiments that must be performed as animal models 332 become available. The data provided in this manuscript suggest that NHC should be 333 quickly evaluated in primate models of human disease, using immediate models for 334 MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pathogenesis 38,39 . 335\n\nSmall molecule antivirals can exert their antiviral effect through multiple 336 mechanisms including blocking viral entry, inhibiting a virally encoded enzyme, blocking 337 virus particle formation, or targeting a host factor required for replication 40 . For VEE, 338 EIDD-2801 exerts its antiviral activity on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase leading 339 to error catastrophe by inducing an error rate of replication that surpasses the error 340 threshold allowed to sustain a virus population 11,12 . This process occurs when NHC is 341 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

Therefore, the NHC MOA would appear less likely to be affected by the RNA 343 proofreading activity encoded by the nsp14 exonuclease function that otherwise limits 344 misincorperation 41 . Here, we present data using Primer ID NGS, a state of the art deep 345 sequencing-based approach, to quantitate the frequency and identity of the mutational 346 spectra in the MERS-CoV genome in both drug treated primary human airway cells and 347 in mice at single genome resolution 25 . As CoV are positive sense RNA viruses that 348 replicate through a negative sense RNA intermediate, NHC incorporation as a \"C\" or a 349 \"U\" can occur in both polarities of RNA. Using Primer ID NGS, we found increased 350 nucleotide transitions (A to G, G to A, C to U, U to C) consistent with those reported 351 after influenza and VEE infections 11,12 . Under identical conditions, remdesivir did not 352 alter the mutation rate in MERS-CoV genomic RNA, supporting its reported mechanism 353 of action as a chain terminator of viral RNA synthesis 26 . In primary human lung cell 354 cultures and mice infected with MERS-CoV, the NHC mutation rates inversely 355 correlated with a reduction in infectious virus. In addition, we found a positive correlation 356 between increased mutation rates and the frequency of nonsynonymous mutations and 357 the degree of therapeutic efficacy in mice. To explore the potential off-target effect in 358 host mRNA which may contribute to drug toxicity, we also examined the impact of NHC 359 treatment on transcripts from the highly MERS-CoV induced interferon stimulated gene 360 15 (ISG15). While ISG15 is present in great abundance, an accumulation of mutations 361 was not observed in ISG15 in this model even at 500mg/kg dosing. These data also 362 support previous studies using RNAseq to demonstrate that the model coronavirus 363 MHV displayed increased mutation frequencies following NHC treatment in vitro 13 . All 364 together, these data strongly support the notion that EIDD-2801 and its active 365 there was any NHC induced cytotoxicity, Calu3 2B4 cells were plated and treated with 418 NHC only as described above. Cells were exposed to the same ten-point dilution series 419 created for the in vitro efficacy studies. As above, 0.05% DMSO-treated cells served as 420 our 0% cytotoxicity control. Wells without cells served as our 100% cytotoxic positive 421 control. After 48hr, cell viability was measured on a Spectramax (Molecular Devices) via 422 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.19.997890 doi: bioRxiv preprint 500,000 Vero E6 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates. The following day, medium 495 was removed and serial dilutions of clarified lung homogenate were added per plate (10 -496 1 to 10 -6 dilutions) and incubated at 37\u02daC for 1hr after which wells were overlayed with 497 1X DMEM, 5% Fetal Clone 2 serum, 1X antibiotic/antimycotic, 0.8% agarose. Two days 498 after, plaques were enumerated to generate a plaque/ml value. Lung hemorrhage is a 499 gross pathological phenotype readily observed by the naked eye driven by the degree 500 of virus replication where the coloration of the lung changes from pink to dark red 48,49 . 501\n\nThe large left lobe was placed in 10 % buffered formalin and stored at 4\u00b0C follows: Vehicle (n = 10), -2hr (n = 10), +12hr (n = 10), +24hr (n = 10), +48hr (n = 10). 523\n\nThe numbers of mice per group for the MERS-CoV therapeutic studies were as follows: 524\n\nVehicle (n = 9), -2hr (n = 9), +12hr (n = 9), +24hr (n = 7), +48hr (n = 10).

On 5dpi 526 for SARS-CoV and 6dpi for MERS-CoV, animals were humanely sacrificed and tissues 527 were harvested and analyzed as described above.
