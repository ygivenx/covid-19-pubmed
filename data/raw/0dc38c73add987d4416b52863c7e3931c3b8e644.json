{"title": "Transmissible gastroenteritis in piglets.\" A model of infantile viral diarrhea", "body": "I N ~ O S T (3 A S E S of acute infantile gastroenteritis occurring in temperate climates, no specific etiologic agent is isolated? Usually, the clinical course of the disease suggests an acute infection, presumably viral, although to date extensive virologic studies from our institution and elsewhere have been unrewarding.i, 2 Nevertheless, we have begun a series of experiments to explore the mechanisms that cause diarrhea in a specific enteric viral infection in swine, transmissible gastroenteritis. This report will deal with our initial observations which characterize the clinical response and the diarrhea in this disease. Also, we will describe data on the activities of certain intestinal mucosal enzymes, in particular, sodium-potassium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (Na-K-ATPase). This information may provide a clue to the site and nature of the primary defect of intestinal function and may lead to a greater understanding of a potentially fatal disease in infants.\n\nTransmissible gastroenteritis is caused by a Corona virus? Symptoms of the disease are vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration within 24 hours of infection. 4, 5 In piglets affected at or near birth, the mortality rate is close to 100 per cent; in older piglets there is severe diarrhea which subsides within two weeks.5, 6 The virus infects the proximal small bowel4, 7, s where a mucosal lesion may occur, particularly in animals less than 14 days of age. 4-s\n\nPigs. Piglets from eight litters of York breed were used in this study. They were left with the sow until age 17 to 20 days when they were placed in holding pens and fed canned whole evaporated cow's milk (Farmer's Wife Brand, Cow & Gate Ltd., Brockville, Ontario, Canada).\n\nVirus. The Purdue strain of transmissible gastroenteritis virus was used. It had been pig passaged six times, and the inoculum was prepared as described, r Experimental plan. We used a total of 49 piglets. Of these, 31 were inoculated orally with transmissible gastroenteritis virus at 23 to 26 days of age. Control piglets were matched-fed litter mates (each fed the mean volume of the intake of the infected pigs in their own litter). Piglets were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups: acute, convalescent, or recovered. Piglets were killed by electrocution as follows: acute, 42 hours post inoculation; convalescent, 1 week post inoculation; and recovered, 2 weeks post inoculation. During the 24 hour period before the pigs were killed we collected stool and urine from male pigs in each litter using metabolic cages constructed of Plexiglas, which we could adjust to the size of the piglet. We sampled blood from the anterior vena cava immediately prior to killing the pigs. Piglets did not receive intravenous therapy. Of the total number of pigs inoculated, five died and two failed to develop symptoms of the disease.\n\nTissue preparation for enzymes. We elec= trocuted the pigs and immediately dissected out the entire gastrointestinal tract and placed it on ice. Sections of gut 20 cm. in length were removed from proximal jejunum (beginning 6 cm. below the pylorus), midjejunum (midpoint of small intestine), distal ileum (20 crn. proximal to cecum), proximal colon (beginning 10 cm. below cecum), and distal colon (ending 20 cm. proximal to the anus). A 1 cm. piece from both ends of each section was taken for histologic study. The remainder was flushed with iced saline, slit open, and the mueosa was scraped off with a glass slide and homog6nized (100 rag. per milliliter of 2.5 mM. EDTA adjusted to pH 7.5 with TRIS) in a power-driven tissue grinder (Arthur Thomas Company, Philadelphia, Pa.) for 20 strokes at 1,500 r.p.m. This homogenate was aliquoted into five vials and, after quick freezing in acetone and Dry Ice, was stored at -30 ~ C. until enzyme activity was determined. We used a new vial for each assay, no vial was frozen more than once.\n\nPreparation of tissue for hlstologie study. Tissues for light microscopy were stapled onto paraffin blocks for identification, fixed in Suza's fixative for 24 hours, and then transferred to 95 per cent aIcohol and processed routinely for staining with hematoxylin and eosin. Each section was examined by one investigator who did not know whether it was from a control or infected pig. Villous height and crypt depth were measured with a standard micrometer eyepiece, previously calibrated, and epithelial cell damage and round cell infiltration of the lamina propria were rated.\n\nEnzyme assays. We designed an assay for Na-K-ATPase based on its biochemical characteristics in whole homogenates of intestinal mucosa from normal pigs. Thawed homogenates were rehomogenized with an equal volume of 0.1 per cent sodium deoxycholate in 2.5 raM. of EDTA and 20 >1 of this preparation was added to a total volume of 1.0 ml. of either an incubation medium made up of 5 mlVf. of MgATP (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.), 120 mM. of NaC1, and 20 mlVI. of KC1 in 50 mM. of TRIS buffer, or a second medium containing in addition 0.2 raM. of ouabain (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.). The pH of both solutions was 7.2 at 37 ~ C. We performed reactions in' duplicate in both solutions at 37 ~ C. stopping them after 15 minutes by plunging the tubes into an ice-water bath and adding 0.5 ml. of cold 8 per cent perchloric acid. Tubes were kept on ice until inorganic phosphate was measured in a Technicon autoanalyzer by the method of Gomori) Since ouabain selectively' inhibits the ATPase activity stimulated by sodium and potassium, the difference in inorganic phosphate produced without Volume 80\n\nTransmissible gastroenteritis 9 2 7 Number 6 and with ouabain represents Na-K-ATPase activity and was expressed as micromoles of pi produced per hour, per milligram of protein as determined by the method of Lowry and associates ~~ modified by Eggstein arid Kreutz ~ using bovine albumin as standard. Mg-ATPase was determined from pi liberated from the medium containing ouabain and was expressed similarly.\n\nSucrase and lactase were measured by the method of Dahlqvist ~2 at a substrate concentration of 0.11 mM. and alkaline phosphatase by the method of Kelly and Hamilton. 13 Disaccharidase units were micromoles of glucose produced per minute; alkaline phosphatase units were millimoles of p-nitrophenol produced per hour. Statistical analyses were based on distribution of enzyme activity following a lognormal skew. All data were converted to logarithms before analyses. The mean was plotted as the antilogarithm and scatter expressed as the antilogarithm of one standard error above and below the mean.\n\nStool determinations. Stools were homogenized in a Sorvall \"OmniMixer\" (Ivan Sorvall, Inc., Norwalk, Conn.), using a minimum volume of deionized water.\n\nTo determine chloride a 1 Gin. aliquot was mixed in a total volume of 4 inl. of chilled 10 per cent nitric acid. After incubating the mixture for 10 minutes at room temperature, the supernate from a 10 minute low-speed centrifugation was analyzed? 4 Recover ranged from 89 to 92 per cent.\n\nFor sodium and potassium determinations stool homogenates were wet ashed by incubating 1 Gm. of homogenate in 10 ml. of concentrated nitric acid overnight in a 100 ml. evaporating dish; the contents were then boiled gently with several aliquots of concentrated nitric acid and finally with 10 ml. of deionized water, always with a small volume (about 4 ml.) of liquid remaining in the dish. This mixture and rinsings from the dish were made up to a volume of 10 ml. in a volumetric flask. A flame spectrophotometer was used to determine sodium and potassium on diluted aliquots of the supernate from a 10 minute centrifugation at low speed. Ninety-two to 100 per cent of sodium and 93 to 104 per cent of potassium was recovered.\n\nThe pH was determined on fresh stool using pH paper. The stool was hydrolyzed by boiling for one minute with 1.0N HCI and neutralized; it was then assayed for reducing substances? ~ Serum determinations. Standard methods were used for the following determinations: pH, 18 venous carbon dioxide tension, 17 magnesium, ~s calcium, ~9 chloride, 1~ and total proteins. 2~ Serum sodium and potassium were determined using a flame spectrophotometer, protein by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate , and osmolality by freezing-point depression.\n\nAcute phase. Eight infected pigs were studied during the acute phase of the disease; they were compared with 10 matched-fed litter mates. Mean weight of all pigs at the start of the experiment was 4.78 \u2022 0.86 Kg. After 42 hours the infected pigs had lost 20 per cent of their body weight; weight of control pigs remained unchanged (Table I) stools contained no measurable reducing substances.\n\nExcept for a decrease in calcium, serum electrolytes were unchanged in the infected pigs. Serum sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, total protein, and protein patterns remained the same (Table III) . However, pH fell from 7.36 to 7.30, and carbon dioxide tension and bicarbonate were significantly lowered in the infected group. Infected pigs did not differ from control pigs with respect to villous dimensions, epithelial cell structure, or round cell infiltration. There was no difference between groups with respect to weight of mucosa or mucosal protein content per 20 cm. segment. Results of enzyme determinations of mucosal homogenates from small and large intestine are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 . The only difference in Na-K-ATPase activity was in the proximal jejunum where it was decreased in infected pigs. In this area Mg-ATPase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactase were also decreased. In the mid jejunum, Iactase, sucrase, and alkaline phosphatase were decreased. In the ileum, lactase and sucrase were decreased. In none of these enzymes was the activity changed in the proximal or distal colon. Convalescent phase. Ten infected piglets were compared to five icontrol piglets one week after inoculation. Specific enzyme ac- tivities were determined at those intestinal sites where enzyme activities had been lowered in infected piglets in the acute phase, and except for decreased Na-K-ATPase activity in the proximal jejunum (Fig. 3) found they were not different from the same activities in control piglets. By chance, there were no male plgs in the infected group so stools could not be collected for analysis. The infected pigs weighed 97 per cent of their original weight which was not statistically different from the control pigs who weighed 104 per cent, suggesting that rehydration had taken place.\n\nRecovered phase. Six recovered pigs were compared to three control pigs two weeks post inoculation. No significant differences in intestinal enzyme activities or in serum pH, electrolytes, and protein existed between the two groups. Stool weights, fat, and electrolytes obtained on three male piglets and three control piglets were similar.\n\nTransmissible gastroenteritis proved to be a useful model for the study of acute diarrhea. Oral administration of transmissible gastroenteritis virus produced a consistent self-limited disease in piglets characterized by anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration, similar in its clinical presentation to infantile gastroenteritis. Our preliminary data have provided important information for future investigations of this condition.\n\nWater moves in and out of the intestine passively in response to osmotic pressure gradients. 21 Diarrhea can be produced when osmotically active material is present within the gut lumen in excessive amounts, stimulating water movement into the lumen. 22 The massive fecal output of infected pigs contained large quantities of sodium, potassium, and chloride. The concentration of these ions in stool was also increased. Specifically, the high sodium concentration suggested that there was either a defect in intestinal ab~ sorption of sodium or an increased secretion of this ion into the gut lumen. In simple osmotic diarrhea, such as would be produced by water moving in response to mannitol in the lumen, the stools contain much less sodium in proportion to water73\n\nThere is now considerable evidence relating active transport of sodium to Na-K-ATPase in many organs. 2~ In dog kidney, Nechay and Nelson 25 found a direct correlation between distribution of this enzyme and sodium When infected pigs were compared to control pigs, lactase was decreased in proximal jejunum (p < 0.001), midjejunum (p < 0.005), and ileum (p < 0.005); sucrase was decreased in midjejunum (p < 0.01) and ileum (p < 0.05); and alkaline phosphatase was decreased in proximal jejunum (p < 0.01) and midjejunum (p < 0.001). reabsorption in cortex, medulla, and papilla. In normal pigs we found that the activity of the Na-K-ATPase was significantly greater in the proximal jejunum than in other regions of the bowel, implying that, contrary to current concepts, 22 this region does absorb sodium by an active transport process. In the acute stage of the disease, the activity of the enzyme was depressed in the proximal jejunum only, suggesting that sodium absorption was defective at that site. If this suggestion is valid, the distal bowel must have been unable to compensate for the increased load of sodium, since losses in stool were excessive. The same pattern of Na-K-ATPase activity was present in animals one week post inoculation, but the activity had returned to control values within another week (Fig.   3 ).\n\nIn relating activity of Na-K-ATPase to sodium transport, the possibility is recognized that the asymmetrical properties of the cells have been destroyed by homogenization. However, the assays were performed under optimum conditions for the enzyme so that, since both control and diseased tissue were processed exactly alike, our results should have quantitative relevance. To date there have been few other quantitative determinations of intestinal Na-K-ATPase activity in the normal and diseased state. Activity of this enzyme in biopsies from the proximal jejunum is lower in the acute than in the convalescent phase of cholera, 2G a disease associated with tremendous losses of sodium and water in stool. Recent studies of this disease in human subjects and in animals have shown significantly increased activity of adenyl cyclase in intestinal muco~a, linking the mechanism of diarrhea to cyclic adenosine monophosphate and chloride secre-tionW -sl Obviously, it is important to assess this enzyme system in piglets with transmissible gastroenteritis.\n\nAlthough activity of lactase in the small intestine decreased and piglets were ingesting small quantities of dietary lactose, their stools were not acidic and contained no sugar, indicating that disaccharidase deficiency was unlikely to be the primary cause of the diarrhea?Z-35\n\nIn the tissues examined by light microscopy, the groups did not differ with respect to villous measurements. No villous atrophy described in younger pigs s, 7, aG was found. However, our enzyme data indicate that the epithelial cells were functionally damaged, probably a direct effect of the virus which replicates in the epithelial cells of the uppe, small bowel, as The animals were matched fed; therefore, the decreases in enzyme activity were not due to poor nutrition of the infected pigs. Nor are the decreases likely to be due to gross derangement of ionic concentration of extracellular fluid, since during the acute phase values for serum sodium, potassium, and chloride were alike in infected and control animals. We have no explanation for the hypocalcemia in infected pigs.\n\nTo further define the mechanisms of diarrhea, we intend to proceed with studies on transmissible gastroenteritis. Such studies should lead to a better understanding of the perplexing problem of acute infectious diarrhea of infancy."}
