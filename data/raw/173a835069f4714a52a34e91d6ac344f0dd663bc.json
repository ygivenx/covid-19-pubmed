{"title": "", "body": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae in the family of Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. Within the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, there are four genera: alpha-coronavirus (\u03b1-CoV), beta-coronavirus (\u03b2-CoV), gamma-coronavirus (\u03b3-CoV) and delta-coronavirus (\u03b4-CoV) [1, 2] . The genome of CoVs is an enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA, and its size varies between 26 kb and 32 kb (the largest genome of known RNA viruses). Both \u03b1-and \u03b2-CoV genera are known to infect mammals, while \u03b4and \u03b3-CoVs infect birds. The recent two outbreaks of viral pneumonia caused by \u03b2-CoVs are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS). In 2002, the outbreak of SARS-CoV was first reported in China and then spread quickly worldwide, resulting in hundreds of deaths with an 11% mortality rate [3, 4] . In 2012, MERS-CoV was first emerged in Saudi Arabia and subsequently spread in other countries, with a fatality rate of 37% [5] [6] [7] . In both of these epidemics, these viruses are likely originated from bats and then infect humans through another intermediate animal hosts [the civet (Paguma larvata) for SARS-CoV and the camel for MERS-CoV] [8] [9] [10] .\n\nStarting from December 2019, a number of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology emerged in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China. The genome sequencing has demonstrated that this pneumonia named COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2, formally known as 2019-nCoV [11] [12] [13] . Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, this newly emerged SARS-CoV2 belongs to the B lineage of the \u03b2-CoV.\n\nTo date, COVID-19 has spread rapidly in 72 countries, causing >90,000 confirmed cases and over 2,946 deaths as of 3 March 2020. Considering the global threat, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared that COVID-19 is a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\". However, there are no vaccines against SARS-CoV2 and specific therapeutic drugs for this communicable disease. Thus, a better understanding of SARS-CoV2 is essential for exploring effective vaccines and drugs. In this review, we summarize recent progress of SARS-CoV2 to provide a framework for prevention and treatment of COVID-19.\n\nThe SARS-CoV2 genome (30 kb in size) encodes a large non-structural polyprotein, open reading frame (ORF) 1a/b, which is further proteolytically cleaved to generate 15/16 proteins, four structural proteins and five accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7, ORF8 and ORF9) [14] [15] [16] (Figure 1 ). The four structural proteins consist of the spike surface glycoprotein (S), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E), and nucleocapsid protein (N), which are essential for SARS-CoV2 assembly and infection. The spike surface glycoprotein plays a key role in its attachment to host cells and can be further cleaved by host proteases into an N-terminal S1 subunit and a membrane-bound C-terminal S2 region [17] . The binding of the S1 subunit to a host receptor can destabilize the prefusion trimer, leading to shedding of the S1 subunit and transition of the S2 subunit into a highly stable postfusion conformation [18] .\n\nIn order to engage a host receptor, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit undergoes hinge-like conformational movements, which transiently hide or expose the determinants of receptor binding [19, 20] . These two states of the S1 subunit can be regarded as the \"down\" conformation and the \"up\" conformation. The former represents an inaccessible state of the receptor, and the latter corresponds to an accessible state of the receptor [19, 21] . Therefore, understanding the structure and function of the spike protein can help develop monoclonal antibody drugs and guide the design and development of vaccines.\n\nSARS-CoV2 is the seventh member of the family of CoVs that infect humans. Four human CoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1) are able to cause a wide range of upper respiratory tract infections (common cold), whereas the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV are responsible for atypical pneumonia. The causes of different infection sites are likely related to the presence of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the lower respiratory tract, which are the major human receptors for the surface spike (S) glycoprotein of MERS and SARS-CoV, respectively [22] [23] [24] . The genetic sequence of SARS-CoV2 is at least 70% similar to that SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV2 is capable of using the same cell entry receptor, ACE2, to infect humans, as SARS-CoV [25, 26] . However, there are more differences in the key S proteins that viruses interact with host cells. SARS-CoV2 spike binds to human ACE2 with approximately 10-to 20-fold higher affinity than the SARS-CoV spike [19] , making it easier to spread from human-to-human.\n\nUpon entry into alveolar epithelial cells, SARS-CoV2 replicates rapidly and triggers a strong immune response, resulting in cytokine storm syndromes and pulmonary tissue damage.\n\nCytokine storm syndromes, also known as hypercytokinemia, are a group of disorders characterized by the uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and are important causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure [27] [28] [29] .\n\nAnalysis of the first 99 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV2 infection revealed that cytokine storm syndromes occurred in patients with severe COVID-19 and 17 (17%) had ARDS and, among them, 11 (11%) patients deteriorated within a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure [30] . In addition, the numbers of total T cells, CD4 + T and CD8 + T cells are decreased in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection, and the surviving T cells are functionally exhausted [31] , suggesting a decreased immune function in SARS-CoV2-infected patients.\n\nARDS, decreased immune function, and secondary infection further worsens respiratory failure.\n\nSince December 2019, multiple cases of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were successively reported from Wuhan ity, Hubei province, China. They shared a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan city, and it has been confirmed to be an acute respiratory infection caused by a novel CoV. To date, the number of patients without a history of exposure to the Huanan seafood market is significantly increased. Additionally, some cases without a history of travel to Wuhan emerged [32] . These early phenomena suggest the possibility of human-to-human transmission. \n\nThe initial source of SARS-CoV2 is still unknown, although the first cases were linked to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan city. Besides seafood, it is reported on social media that some wild animals including birds, snakes, marmots, and bats were sold at the Huanan seafood market. It has been reported that environmental samples obtained from the marketplace have come back positive for the novel CoV, but the specific animal has not been identified [33] . More recently, several studies have suggested that bats may be the potential natural host of SARS-CoV2 [26, 34, 35] . The whole genome-wide nucleotide sequences of SARS-CoV2 are 96% identical to a bat coronavirus [26] . Importantly, SARS-CoV2 has been isolated from pangolins and it was found that the isolated pangolin coronavirus genomes have approximately 85.5% to 92.4% similarity to SARS-CoV2 [36] , suggesting that pangolin may \n\nThe novel CoV can be transmitted between humans via respiratory droplets. Notably, the respiratory tract is probably not the only route of transmission. Close contact is also a source of transmission of SARS-CoV2. For example, SARS-CoV2 can be transmitted through direct or indirect contact with mucous membranes in the eyes, mouth, or nose [37] [38] [39] . There is also a possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment with continuous exposure to high concentrations of aerosol. Moreover, it has been reported that COVID-19 patients have some gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting [40, 41] . A recent study showed that the enteric symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia are associated with the invaded ACE2-expressing enterocytes [42] , suggesting that the digestive tract is a potential route of SARS-CoV2 infection besides respiratory tract. However, additional studies are required to test this possibility. In addition, whether transmission of SARS-CoV2 can occur via breast milk or mother-infant vertically has not been determined.\n\nAll populations are generally susceptible to SARS-CoV2. The elderly and people with basic diseases or low immune function are more likely to become severe cases [30, 43] . In addition, pregnant women and newborns infected with SARS-CoV2 are also prone to develop severe pneumonia [44, 45] . Thus, these vulnerable patients should be considered as a focus on the prevention and management of SARS-CoV2 infection.\n\nThe mean incubation period of SARS-CoV2 was estimated to be 3-7 days, ranging from 2 to 14 days [46, 47] , which indicates a long transmission period of SARS-CoV2. It is estimated that SARS-CoV2 latency is consistent with those of other known human CoVs, including non-SARS human CoVs (mean 3 days, range 2-5 days) [48] , SARS-CoV (mean 5 days, range 2-14 days) [49] , and MERS-CoV (mean 5-7 days, range 2-14 days) [50] . Besides, it has been reported that asymptomatic COVID-19 patients during their incubation periods can effectively transmit SARS-CoV2 [51, 52] , which is different from SARS-CoV because most SARS-CoV cases are infected by \"super spreaders\", and SARS-CoV cases can not infect susceptible persons during the incubation period [53] . Taken together, these data fully support the current period of active monitoring recommended by the WHO of 14 days.\n\nThe basic reproduction number is a very important threshold related to the transmissibility of the virus, which is usually expressed as R nought (R 0 ). The R 0 can be implicitly defined as the average number of secondary infections produced by an infectious person. It is generally believed that if R 0 is greater than 1, the number of infected cases will increase exponentially and cause an epidemic or even a pandemic. Liu et al. reviewed the R 0 of the SARS-CoV2 and found that the estimates ranged from 1.4 to 6.49, with a mean of 3.28 [54] , which is higher than those of SARS-CoV (R 0 : 2~5).\n\nAt the onset of the disease, the main manifestations of COVID-19 patients were fatigue, fever, dry cough, myalgia and dyspnea, and less common symptoms were nasal congestion, headache, runny nose, sore throat, vomiting, diarrhea. Severe patients often have dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one week after onset, and then septic shock, ARDS, difficult to correct metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction develop rapidly. Of note, severe and critical patients can also only present with a low fever, or even no obvious fever, and mild patients show only low fever, mild fatigue, and no pneumonia [40, 43] . These asymptomatic cases or mild cases can also spread the SARS-CoV2 between humans.\n\nRecently, Zhe et al. reported pathological features of the first patient who died from SARS-CoV2 infection [55] . Biopsy samples were obtained from lung tissue of the patient and it was found that the pathological features of COVID-19 are related to ARDS. For example, the evident desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation were seen in the lung tissue, indicating ARDS. Moreover, the inflammatory infiltration of interstitial mononuclear was found in lung tissue. Multinucleated giant cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes featured by large nucleoli, prominent nucleoli, and amphophilic granular cytoplasm were showed in the intraalveolar spaces, suggesting viral cytopathic-like changes [55] . These pathological characteristics of COVID-19 are highly similar to those seen in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection [56, 57] . Taken together, understanding the pathological characteristics of the severe case of COVID-19 could help provide new insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-infected pneumonia, which may help physicians to formulate a timely strategy for the treatment of similar severe patients and decrease mortality.\n\nCT is often found to be positive when patients with SARS-CoV2 develop a persistent cough, fever, and unexplained fatigue. Typical CT presentations of COVID-19 patients include bilateral pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass shadow, pulmonary consolidation and nodules, two-sided diffuse distribution, sometimes with a rounded morphology and a peripheral lung distribution [58, 59] . In the early course of diseases, chest images show multiple small patchy shadows and interstitial changes, which is evident in the lung periphery.\n\nSevere cases could spread to the bronchus with the progress of the disease, gradually spread to the whole lung, and with infrequent interlobar pleural thickening and pleural effusion.\n\nThe rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV2 is essential to control the outbreak of COVID. Nucleic acid detection is a major method of laboratory diagnosis. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a molecular biological diagnosis technology based on nucleic acid sequences. The complete genomes of SARS-CoV2 sequences are available in Genebank. Thus, the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV2 can be detected by RT-qPCR or by viral gene sequencing of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, stool, sputum, or blood samples [60, 61] . However, the collection of these specimen types by healthcare workers requires close contact with patients, which poses a risk of spreading the virus to the healthcare workers. Moreover, the collection of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens may cause bleeding, especially in patients with thrombocytopenia [32] . Importantly, Kelvin et al. found that SARS-CoV2 could be effectively detected in the saliva specimens of infected patients [62] . This suggests that saliva is a promising non-invasive specimen type for diagnosis, monitoring, and infection control of COVID-19 patients.\n\nBesides RT-qPCR, Zhang et al. described a protocol by using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK (Specific High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing) technique for the detection of SARS-CoV2 [63] . Using synthetic SARS-CoV2 virus RNA fragments, the authors found that this technique is able to consistently detect target sequences of the SARS-CoV2 in a range between 20 and 200 aM (10-100 copies per microliter of input). This test can be read out using a dipstick in less than 1 hour, without requiring elaborate instrumentation [63] . Compared with RT-qPCR, SHERLOCK technique is more accurate, and the detection time is reduced by half. Thus, the SHERLOCK technique used for the detection of SARS-CoV2 in clinical samples of patients will be expected.\n\nSuspected and confirmed cases should be treated in designated hospitals with effective isolation and protective conditions. Suspected cases should be treated in a single room and isolated, and confirmed cases can be treated in the same ward. Besides, critical cases need to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) as soon as possible.\n\nThe general treatment strategies include bed rest and supportive treatments, ensuring sufficient energy intake, maintaining a constant internal environment (water, electrolytes, and other internal environment factors), and monitoring vital signs (heart rate, pulse, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, etc.). [64, 65] . It has been reported that cynomolgus monkeys are protected from infection with SARS CoV by treatment with IFN-\u03b1 [66] . Moreover, the therapeutic benefit of synthetic recombinant IFN-\u03b1 for patients with SARS was demonstrated in a pilot clinical trial [67] . Thus, IFN-\u03b1 should be considered a candidate drug for COVID therapy.\n\nLopinavir-ritonavir was first known as a protease inhibitor that can interfere with the replication and synthesis of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), leading to the production of immature, non-infectious virus particles [68, 69] . It has been reported that ritonavir and lopinavir can bind to the endopeptidase C30 of SARS-CoV2 protease, which is evaluated by molecular models [70] . This suggests that lopinavir-ritonavir may exert an antiviral effect by inhibiting the protein synthesis of the SARS-CoV2. In addition, several lines of evidence showed that treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir alone or in combination with other antiviral drugs was shown to improve the outcome of severe patients with SARS or MERS by ameliorating ARDS [71] [72] [73] . Given that SARS-CoV2 is similar to these two viruses, lopinavir-ritonavir may have a beneficial effect on COVID-19. Future studies are needed to test this possibility.\n\nRibavirin is a nucleoside analogue with broad antiviral activity. It can prevent the replication of RNA and DNA viruses by suppressing the activity of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which is required for the synthesis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP).\n\nRibavirin was widely used to treat SARS patients with or without concomitant use of steroids during the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong [74] [75] [76] . Thus, ribavirin could be considered as a treatment option for COVID-19 patients.\n\nChloroquine is a widely-used antimalarial and autoimmune disease drug. Recently, chloroquine has been reported as a potential broadspectrum antiviral drug [77, 78] . Wang et al. found that chloroquine effectively suppresses the recently emerged novel CoVs (SARS-CoV2) in vitro [79] . Chloroquine is a cheap and safe drug that has been used for more than 70 years and, thus, it is potentially clinically applicable against COVID-19.\n\nArbidol is an antiviral drug against the influenza infection, which is widely used in Russia and China. Arbidol and arbidol mesylate were shown to have a potent inhibitor effect in reducing the reproduction of SARS virus in vitro [80] . Low-level evidence included retrospective cohort, case reports, and case series revealed that arbidol alone or combined with anti-viral drugs produced certain benefits in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia [81] [82] [83] . Currently, many randomized clinical control trials are carried out on studying the efficacy of arbidol on COVID-19 pneumonia in China.\n\nRemdesivir, a nucleoside analogue GS-5734, was reported to inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in vivo [84, 85] . More recently, the in vitro study showed that remdesivir potently blocked SARS-CoV2 infection at low-micromolar concentration and showed high selectivity index (SI) [79] . In addition, the first case of SARS-CoV2 infection in the United States was treated with intravenous remdesivir when the patient's condition deteriorated [41] .\n\nAlthough remdesivir has some benefits for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, the randomized controlled trials are still required to determine its efficacy and safety.\n\nTaken together, these antiviral drugs may be promising treatment options for the treatment of COVID-19. However, there are also a few points worth noting here: 1) The potential interaction of these antiviral drugs with other therapeutic drugs should be considered. 2) It should be noticed that the adverse reactions caused by lopinavir/ritonavir, such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and liver damage. 3) It is not recommended to use 3 or more antiviral drugs at the same time, and the use of related drugs should be stopped when there are intolerable side effects. 4) Further evaluation of the efficacy of current antiviral drugs in clinical applications is needed.\n\nNatural killer (NK) cells are important immune cells necessary for defence against microbe-infected, stressed, or malignant cells. Human NK cells lyse antibody-coated virus-infected cells via the process of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) [86] .\n\nshown that NK cells can exert antiviral activity by mediating ADCC against SARS, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and HIV [87] [88] [89] . Umbilical cord blood is a promising source of allogeneic NK cells. Recently, Sorrento and Celularity have announced the launch of a clinical collaboration aimed at extending the use of CYNK-001, an allogeneic, off-the-shelf, umbilical cord blood-derived NK cell therapy, to the treatment of the newly emerged SARS-CoV2 infection [90] . While developing new drugs, new vaccines or clinical trials of old drugs, carrying out NK cell therapy to enhance immunity is currently a very feasible strategy for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\nIt is well known that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have strong anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions. Umbilical cord blood and placenta are good sources of MSCs.\n\nNumerous studies have shown that treatment with MSCs can ameliorate acute/chronic lung injury and ARDS by suppressing infiltration of immune cells to pulmonary tissues and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion [91] [92] [93] [94] . In addition, MSCs contribute to reducing lung fibrosis and enhancing tissue repair [95, 96] . Besides routine antiviral treatment, it is important to treat cytokine storm syndromes, ARDS and acute lung injury in patients with severe COVID-19 to prevent the progression of disease and reduce mortality. Thus, MSCs may be a promising therapeutic option for this disease.\n\nAntiviral antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, and IgD) produced in convalescent plasma from recovered patients can effectively treat patients with viral infections. Convalescent plasma therapy has been widely used in infectious diseases, such as poliomyelitis, influenza A (H5N1) and Ebola [97] [98] [99] . In addition, such passive immunization can also be achieved by using convalescent plasma from patients with SARS-CoV infection. It has been reported that a small number of SARS-CoV-infected patients in Taiwan and Hong Kong received the treatment of convalescent plasma during the early course of the disease with certain clinical benefits, including a reduction of plasma viral load from ~10 5 copies/mL to undetectable levels 24 h after plasma transfusion [100] [101] [102] . Thus, convalescent plasma should, theoretically, be a promising option for the treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV2 infection, although this has not been tested clinically.\n\nThe remission of the SARS-CoV2 epidemic may depend on the development of monoclonal antibodies. Previous studies have identified a number of effective monoclonal antibodies that target SARS-CoV spike protein to prevent the virus from entering host cells [103] [104] [105] . The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of 193 amino acids (residues 318-510) in spike protein is the key target of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies [106] . The SARS-CoV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies CR3014 and CR3022 were found to bind non-competitively to the SARS-CoV RBD and neutralized the virus in a synergistic manner [104] . A recent study showed that CR3022 could combine effectively with SARS-CoV2 RBD (KD of 6.3 nM) [107] . Moreover, the epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the binding site of ACE2 in SARS-CoV2 RBD [107] . Thus, CR3022 could be a promising therapeutic candidate, alone or in combination with other neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\nGlycyrrhizin, an active component of liquorice roots in Chinese Medicine, could effectively inhibit the replication of SARS-associated coronavirus in vitro [108, 109] . Further, high doses of glycyrrhizin have been used in clinical trials and the drug was reported to be clinically effective for the treatment of SARS at that time [110, 111] . Recently, glycyrrhizin was predicted to have the ability for binding ACE2 with potential anti-COVID-19 effects [112] . Hesperetin, a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, is a natural predominant flavonoid found in citrus fruits. Hesperetin dose-dependently suppresses the cleavage activity of the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV in cell-free and cell-based assays [113] . Also, hesperetin was reported to have the potential to inhibit ACE2, therefore, block the infection of SARS-CoV2 [112] . Baicalin, another traditional Chinese herbal medicine, is a flavone isolated from Scutellaria baicalensis. It has been shown that baicalin has antiviral activity against 10 clinical isolates of SARS-CoV by neutralization tests [114] . In addition, quercetin is a plant flavone that is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine and botanical medicine.\n\nQuercetin was reported to exert antivirus effects by inhibiting the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV [115] and blocking the entry of SARS-CoV into host cells [116] . Therefore, these studies suggest that Chinese Medicine also plays a key role in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\nSARS-CoV was firstly appeared in 2002 and spread rapidly to 32 countries and regions, and then the world experienced the outbreak of MERS-CoV. Recently, the newly emerged SARS-CoV2 is undoubtedly a warning. It has been confirmed that SARS-CoV2 enter lung cells by binding to ACE2. Besides pulmonary tissue, ACE2 is also highly expressed in other tissues, including bile duct, liver, gastrointestinal organs (small intestine, duodenum), esophagus, testis, and kidney [42, [117] [118] [119] . Thus, these organs may also be damaged by SARS-CoV2. Currently, SARS-CoV2 has spread rapidly in multiple countries, caused severe illness, and sustained human-to-human transmission making it a concerning and serious public health threat. Considering the global threat to health caused by SARS-CoV2, the effective prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia will be urgently needed.\n\nHowever, the development of drugs for pathogenic SARS-CoV2 is still a major problem for humans, and there are currently no officially approved drugs to treat COVID-19. In view of the epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV2, it is crucial to cut off the spread of the virus through the prevention and control methods of epidemic, such as isolating infected patients and controlling the source of infection. At the same time, wild animals trafficking must be banned to reduce the spread of coronavirus. Additionally, it is necessary to make full use of the currently limited evidence for therapeutic drugs to develop strategies of drug application to prevent and control the transmission of SARS-CoV2. It has been confirmed that the genome sequence of SARS-CoV2 shares high identity with that of bat or human SARS-CoV. A number of antiviral drugs and treatment methods for SARS-CoV infection have also been considered for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\nWe have been warned three times in recent years. CoVs are highly vulnerable to public health intervention strategies, but the increasing incidence of CoV emergence in livestock "}
