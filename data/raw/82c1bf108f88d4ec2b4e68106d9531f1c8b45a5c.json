{"title": "A combined RNA-seq and whole genome", "body": "on the assessment of the probability that a given DNA variant is pathogenic. In this study, we aimed to develop a pipeline that would detect putative non-96 coding pathogenic mutations in a small family. We present a pilot study 97 performed in a five member family with two siblings affected by cone dysfunction The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. Whole exome sequence data was analyzed in house 43 and whole genome data 178 was analyzed in collaboration with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard using 179 methodology described previously 20 . Briefly, BWA was used for alignment.\n\nGATK was used for single nucleotide polymorphism and insertion/deletion calls. We therefore decided to test for two possible disease scenarios. One is that Table S4 ) 21 . 305 Skin and blood represent tissues that are more readily availableand thus 306 commonly usedfor surrogate diagnostic testing. We found 224 IRD genes to 307 be expressed in HNR (TPM>1). Interestingly we were able to detect expression Table S4 ). Since IRD genes were very 316 poorly represented in the blood samples, we excluded blood from further 317 analysis. 318 We next examined the complexity of the HNR, RO and skin transcriptomes, In order to find the underlying genetic cause of the retinal degeneration in OGI-338 081 affected patients, we conducted differential splicing and gene expression 339 analyses of the RNA-seq data obtained from day 160 ROs of affected versus 340 unaffected siblings. The differential splicing analysis was conducted with CASH 341 51 and MAJIQ 52 algorithms, and we used edgeR algorithm 53 for differential gene 342 expression. CASH detected 106 differential splicing events in 101 genes (Table   343 S6), while MAJIQ detected 522 differential splicing junctions in 260 genes ( Table S8 ). Given such large distances, it is not likely that these variants 353 could cause the alternative splicing events. Moreover, the differential gene 354 expression analysis did not find the NCALD gene to be differentially expressed 355 between the affected and unaffected siblings (Table S9) . Taken together, these 356 results indicate that the NCALD gene variants are most likely not the genetic 357 cause for the disease phenotypes observed in OGI-081. 358 We next examined the CNGB3 gene locus. Based on segregation in the family, However, contrary to our expectations, CNGB3 expression was not significantly 379 down regulated in our RNA-seq dataset, as analyzed using the edgeR program. Interestingly, exon 14b ASS is a stronger than the one located at exon 15 (Table   424 2). It is plausible that the availability of this acceptor site and its ability to compete the authors used \uf044 Score greater than or equal to 0.2, 0.2, and 0.5 respectively.\n\nOut of the variants segregating in OGI-081only eight had scores 0.2<0.5 and only 448 one, variant Chr9:g.86536129C>T, received a \uf044 Score >0.5 (Table S11) As mentioned above, differential gene expression analysis was less informative 519 in the OGI-081 datasets. We compared gene expression levels from each of the 520 affected siblings to that of the unaffected sibling (Table S9) . We found 401 genes 521 to be consistently down regulated, of which 27 were Y linked as expected given 522 that the two affected siblings are females while the unaffected sibling is a male. 523 We excluded these Y linked genes from further analysis. Tools are not currently 524 available to filter out non-Y linked genes that may be differentially expressed 525 .

In addition, 527 we found 1120 genes to be consistently up regulated between the two affected 528 siblings and the unaffected sibling (Table S9 ).
