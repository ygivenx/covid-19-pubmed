{"title": "Case Report Health Care Associated Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS): A Case from Iran", "body": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Infection, has caused recurrent outbreaks worldwide.\n\nIt is associated with severe morbidity and mortality, and is not treatable with the currently available antiviral therapies (1) . Since its emergence in 2012, about 1595 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS have been reported with a fatality rate of more than 30% (global deaths 571) (2) .\n\nvariable, ranging from asymptomatic to very severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock and multi-organ failure resulting in death.\n\nThere is growing evidence that dromedary camel is a reservoir for the virus and a source of human infection (3) .\n\nAlthough it is likely that zoonotic transmission is the starting point of most clusters, person-to-person transmission is the most common form of transmission for MERS-CoV. Nosocomial transmission amplified the spread of MERS, and the majority of cases so far have been reported from hospital outbreaks in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and South Korea (4 \n\nA 43 year-old male anesthesiologist who was also a cigarette smoker from Kerman province of Iran presented with productive cough, dyspnea, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain and fever since 10 days prior to admission on June 16,\n\nHe was well up until 14 days prior to admission. He gave a history of intubating a patient in an emergency situation without standard protective measures. The intubated patient was later diagnosed with MERS-CoV.\n\nFour days later, he developed dyspnea, fever, myalgia, pleuritic chest pain and cough (first dry and then became productive). The patient was referred to Dr. Masih Daneshvari Hospital -NRITLD in Tehran. Upon admission, the patient's body temperature was 38.1\u00b0C, blood pressure was 95/50 mmHg, pulse rate was 106 beats/min, respiratory rate was 32/min and percutaneous oxygen saturation was 63% in room air. Pulmonary An analysis showed that 59% of cases were secondary cases with an epidemiologic relation to other confirmed cases and infection in these cases has occurred more frequently in healthcare settings (63.2%) than due to family contacts (13.7%) (18) . In a recent update by the WHO, it was noted that the number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases increased sharply in relation to the occurrence of health-care-associated outbreaks (6).\n\nSaudi Arabia and three patterns of transmission were described (sporadic, within families, nosocomial transmission to healthcare workers). The true incidence of the disease in the community is not known. Of the 1,695 healthcare contacts and 462 family contacts of confirmed MERS cases, a positive result was obtained from 19 (1.12%) healthcare workers and 14 (3.6%) cases of family contacts.\n\nAs a result, the rate of secondary transmission among family contact is higher than other contacts (19) . Thus, Infection in the healthcare setting is an important risk factor for human-to-human transmission and close and prolonged contact with the index case seems to be a necessity for the disease transmission (20) .
