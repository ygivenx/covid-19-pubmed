{"title": "Early Detection for Cases of Enterovirus- and Influenza-Like Illness through a Newly Established School-Based Syndromic Surveillance System in Taipei, January 2010 ~ August 2011", "body": "Adequate community-based infectious disease surveillance can provide advanced awareness of emerging threats and promote timely, evidence-based prevention and control strategies [1]. Children infected with enterovirus exhibit from asymptomatic, mild symptoms (enterovirus-like illness, EVI) to severe forms with neurologic sequelae, cardiopulmonary failure or death [2, 3]. With no effective antiviral therapy available and an EV71 vaccine under development [4\u20137], surveillance of EVI is necessary to detect early signals, reduce cluster size, and slow spreading. School children infected with influenza have higher viral loads, longer shedding of viruses, and higher attack rates, thus are more likely to amplify transmission and create clusters of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases in families and schools [8\u201310]. An effective early outbreak detection system for school children is, therefore, essential to public health [11, 12].\n\nTo identify cases or clusters of infectious diseases that require an immediate public health response, we developed a nationwide Emergency Department based Syndromic Surveillance System (ED-SSS) in Taiwan after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 [13]. During the 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1 (pdm H1N1/09), the numbers of student ILI cases in Taipei surged. A community-based internet accessible, timely syndromic surveillance system thus replaced past facsimile-based paper reporting. Taipei City had a population of 425,709 schoolchildren from preschools to secondary schools (16% of total) in an area of 271.80 km2 in 2010 [14] and higher isolation rates of the novel pdm H1N1/09 virus in Taiwan [15]. Therefore, the Department of Health in Taipei (Taipei-DOH) implemented the first daily School-based Infectious Disease Syndromic Surveillance System (SID-SSS) with a 100% coverage rate of registered educational institutions from preschools to colleges and universities beginning in January 2010.\n\nThis is the first report to demonstrate the results of a newly-developed syndromic surveillance system with cases identified by non-medical professionals for early detection of common pediatric infectious diseases in the community. The specific aims of this study were: (1) to evaluate the timeliness and feasibility of the novel SID-SSS routinely operating in schools, (2) to find ways to improve its application in public health, and (3) to share our valuable experiences in Taipei with public health professionals in other countries to promote better global surveillance networks in the future.\n\nThe Taipei-DOH invited the other two departments (Education and Social Welfare) to design a more efficient and collaborative infectious disease surveillance system, SID-SSS (http://subweb.health.gov.tw/infection/), by initially adapting electronic-reporting software with a data-sharing user interface. The collected real-time data have auto-feedback which links to both these three government agencies and the participating schools and institutions. Once a cluster of cases is detected, epidemiological investigation and other public health prevention and control measures could be quickly initiated to minimize the health threat. Fig 1 illustrates the flow diagrams of change from a paper-based to a web-based infectious disease reporting system in Taipei\u2019s school surveillance.\n\nSchool nurses and class teachers of all registered schools and educational institutions located in the 12 districts of Taipei City are the first line for surveillance. The syndrome groups of students\u2019 illness and their absence due to common pediatric infectious diseases should be reported to the SID-SSS daily. Totally, there were 1072 preschools (age-group of 0\u20136 year-olds, including daycare, nursery centers and kindergartens), 148 primary schools (7-12-year-olds), 133 secondary schools (13-18-year-olds), 29 universities/colleges/professional schools, and 2279 after-school centers.\n\nThe reporting focuses on the five syndrome groups related to the most common pediatric infectious diseases in Taiwan: (1) enterovirus, (2) influenza, (3) conjunctivitis, (4) diarrhea, and (5) others (chicken pox, scabies, and head louse infection). The system requires all school nurses or class teachers (for those preschools without nurses) of every enrolled institution to collect the following two types of data on a daily basis: (1) obligatory reporting of clinical and epidemiologic information (type of the suspected infection, date of symptom onset, and the class, grade, gender and age of the sick student), and (2) optional supplementary information recorded with a text format (total numbers of absent days with sick children, family members with similar symptoms, medical care transfers, physician diagnosis, and school case management). From this, the SID-SSS can automatically detect the presence and numbers of syndromic cases and school clusters, and capture the secondary cases in schools and from families as well.\n\nA \u201ccluster\u201d was defined as two or more epidemiologically-linked cases (at the same class in the same school) occurring within seven consecutive days for EVI, and those within three consecutive days for ILI, red eye, diarrhea and others. Once a cluster happens, a real-time text-message alert through short message service (SMS) is immediately sent to the public health professionals for further epidemiologic investigations. Then, an epidemiology team in charge of daily monitoring for the disease trends and the Centers for Disease Control in Taipei (e.g. Taipei-CDC) decides the follow-up public health risk management. Different diseases have various criteria to trigger subsequent investigations. The team initiated outbreak investigations and control measures, once the index EVI case, or more than 2 EVI cases, would be detected within a one-time interval, or an EVI cluster event occurred during an epidemic season. The investigation of ILI cases started when the numbers of ILI cases showed abnormally high after comparing the trends of ILI cases in the same weeks in previous years as well as ILI school or family clusters.\n\nTo obtain better data from schools, every submitted case was categorized based on syndrome reports rather than absenteeism. Routinely, symptomatic students detected in classes and the families were telephone-interviewed by teachers to find out whether their symptoms belonged to any of the aforementioned five categories. This information and the verifying symptoms of sick children who sought medical aid at a school\u2019s health rooms/centers were all compiled and finally reported to the SID-SSS through school nurses/teachers.\n\nIn the web-reporting process, school nurses or teachers first selected one of the infectious diseases\u2019 syndrome groups from the five categories (\u201cred eyes\u201d on website for conjunctivitis) and then reported related symptoms and signs of the chosen disease from the next window (such as options of herpangina, hand-foot-mouth diseases and others for EVI). In Taipei, nearly 100% of primary and secondary schools had at least one registered nurse on-site in the compulsory education system, because each school is required to have at least one or two registered nurse(s) for schools with a total number of classes fewer than 40 or with over 40 classes, respectively. Several training workshops were held in December, 2009 to teach school nurses and teachers the public health significance, the differential diagnosis of common pediatric diseases, operation procedures to report to the SID-SSS, legal requirements for reporting, and possible penalties for non-reporting. In addition, post-operation feedback workshops were also held to promote the SID-SSS, and to identify users\u2019 difficulties for further improvement.\n\nWe retrieved the data from 1 January, 2010 to 31 August, 2011 covering all 12 districts of Taipei City for evaluating the quality, temporal trends and timeliness of these data. For the quality of the data, the SID-SSS reserves a column to be filled out the subsequent results of physicians\u2019 diagnoses. Therefore, teachers and nurses can compare the consistency between their initial judgments and the follow-up clinical diagnoses from physicians if the school children seek medical care.\n\nTo determine the timeliness of the SID-SSS, we compared the weekly data of the four most reported syndrome groups (EVI, ILI, red eye and diarrhea), with those from the nationwide hospital-based ED-SSS according to the diagnostic codes described in the International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification, 9th edition [13]. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Furthermore, the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) with over 99% coverage of approximately 25.68 million Taiwan citizens was also used as the second external dataset. To better evaluate the SID-SSS, we applied the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 (LHID2005), a database randomly sampled from the year 2005 registry for beneficiaries, showed no significant differences in the distributions of gender, age from the original NHIRD [16]. Cases (clinic visits) were defined by the selected ICD-9 codes, and health seeking population was estimated by a capture-recapture approach [17, 18]. Chi-square tests and the Pearson correlation coefficients were used for percentage comparisons and correlations, respectively. T-tests were used to compare the means of incidence obtained from different school groups (preschool, primary, and secondary school students and others). The statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, U.S.A.). Variables with p-value less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nTo investigate the spreading pattern across Taipei, we selected the 10 weeks of the peak periods of EVI (Week 19 to 28, 2010) and ILI (Week 47, 2010 to Week 4, 2011). All 12 districts were classified into the four geographic groups\u2014A, B, C, and D, based on their spatial relationships and socioeconomic development status [19]. Group A, B, C and D represented the Taipei Central Businesses District (Taipei-CBD), the para-CBD, the north, and south-east suburban areas, respectively. The district-specific incidence rates of ILI or EVI syndromic cases per 1000 students were calculated by the number of the reported cases for each district divided by the total number of children from the registered preschools to secondary schools in that district. These data were ranked as 1st to 5th quantile for different levels of incidences, based on these four geographic groups. ArcGIS 9.3 program of Geographical Information System (GIS) was used for spatial analysis. The Kriging method [20, 21] was applied to interpolate each grid cell over a spatial domain. To assess the spatio-temporal relationship among the studied cases in a diffusion map, the distance between the centroid of each grid was calculated as the spatial relationship between the incidence rates of the ILI or EVI cases in each district. We made a surface plot of weekly time series as a gradient interpolated between adjacent weeks and district data points. Distance in the map symbolized relative geographic relationship rather than actual distance.\n\nThis study was approved by the Taipei City Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB) and certified on 24 May, 2012 (Approval Number: TCHIRB-1000905). The process of this reporting also followed the regulation for public health disease surveillance in Taiwan. Our data were fully de-identified and anonymized to protect the participants\u2019 privacy, and only aggregated data were used for further analyses and statistical tests. Thus, the informed consent was not needed in this study.\n\nWe first examined the types of infection and sources of reporting through this newly established system. Among the 19,334 syndromic cases reported to the SID-SSS from January 2010 to August 2011, EVI was the most reported syndrome group (77.56%), significantly higher than other major syndrome groups (ILI: 15.75%, red eye: 3.78%, diarrhea: 2.43%, p < 0.001) (). The majority of data were submitted from preschools (42.70%, n = 8256) and primary schools (41.82%, n = 8085), followed by secondary schools (13.88%, n = 2684), and others combined contributing the lowest (1.60%, n = 309).\n\nThe overall absenteeism rate for symptomatic school cases was 96.40% (Table 1), particularly higher in preschools and primary schools [97.97% (8088/8256) and 97.70% (7899/8085), respectively] than secondary schools (91.28%, 2450/2684) and other institutions (65.05%, 201/309). The absenteeism rate was higher in cases of EVI (98.79%) and ILI (96.62%), but lower in those with diarrhea (65.74%) and red eye (66.03%) (p<0.001)\n\nThe male-female (M/F) ratio of the syndromic cases was 1.21 (Table 1), much higher than the data (M/F = 1.09) obtained from population-based school children in Taipei. The M/F ratio was significantly higher in red eye syndrome (2.12) (p<0.001).\n\nCluster events in schools were detected as high as 41.72% among all the reported symptomatic cases (Table 1). Diarrhea was the highest (79.57%) in school clusters whereas red eye (46.44%) and EVI (44.61%) ranked second. Red eye school clusters significantly increased parallel with age (p<0.001), lowest in preschools (20.78%) but more elevated in primary schools (46.69%), secondary schools (49.17%) and other institutions (60.26%). However, EVI school clusters were significantly highest in preschools (60.41%), but lowest in primary schools (27.56%)(p<0.001). ILI clusters accounted for 19.73%, with no differences in various age groups.\n\nIn family clusters, 15.29% of the symptomatic school children reported through the SID-SSS had one or more family members with similar symptoms (Table 1). The suspected family clusters for all syndrome groups were high among reported primary school students (18.95%, 1532/8085) and preschool children (13.43%, 1109/8256), but were low in secondary school students (11.18%, 300/2684) and rarely in other institutions (5.18%, 16/309), including university students. EVI and red eye syndrome were reported with significant higher percentages in family clusters (16.38% and 16.71%) than that of ILI family clusters (10.64%)(p<0.001). However, ILI family clusters were particularly higher in preschools (19.80%, p < 0.001).\n\nThe diffusion pattern in the incidence rates of EVI cases rose from the northern suburban area C to para-CBD districts B and district D, and finally reached A (Taipei-CBD areas) (Fig 2); there was a three-week interval between these areas and district C. The ILI had a similar diffusion pattern but with a shorter interval. The incidence surged also from C and B, the northern districts of Taipei, and then spread to south-eastern districts D and A (Taipei-CBD areas) (Fig 2).\n\nThe time-lag periods from onset of the symptoms (based on school teachers\u2019 observations or students\u2019 complaints) to data entry to the SID-SSS were mostly 2\u20133 days (Table 1). Mean time-lag was significantly shortest in preschools (2.5 \u00b1 3.3), followed by primary schools (2.8 \u00b1 4.5) and secondary schools (3.1 \u00b1 5.1) (p < 0.001). Red eye had the shortest time-lag days (2.2 \u00b1 2.2), but ILI had longer lag days (3.1 \u00b1 8.1)(p< 0.001).\n\nThe percentages of consistency between the school personnel\u2019s impression and the doctor\u2019s clinical diagnosis were quite high for cases of EVI (range: 97.69%-98.33%) and ILI (98.32%-100%) in the SID-SSS (Table 1) but this consistency was much lower for diarrhea (12.15%-45.45%). The overall right judgment for the four most prevalent pediatric infectious diseases in Taipei by school staff was 95.68%, particularly high consistency with ILI (98.88%) and EVI (97.80%)(p< 0.001).\n\nThe temporal trends in the incidence rates of the four most common syndrome groups of diseases reported to the SID-SSS during the study period were further compared with the counts of syndromic cases reported to the ED-SSS (Fig 3, S1 Fig). In addition, age-group specific trends in the incidence of the EVI and ILI cases in the SID-SSS were further compared with those data of the same age groups from the LHID2005, which provide patients\u2019 information without interference from school breaks (Fig 4).\n\n\nEVI: The trend of EVI cases in the SID-SSS had two waves within a year, one in the spring and the other in the autumn. This pattern was parallel with the ED-SSS (shown as high correlation between the two systems, Table 2) (Fig 3A).\n\n\nILI: The SID-SSS detected three ILI peaks in 2010, one in January and the others before and after the summer vacation, with similar patterns as the ED-SSS, except for summer and Lunar New Year vacations (Fig 3B). Another ILI peak in January 2011 (late of Semester 2) was detected two weeks earlier than the one identified in the ED-SSS, with a high correlation between the two systems [Pearson correlation = 0.95, p <0.01] (Table 2).\n\n\nRed eye: Red eye involved several peaks during the periods of pre- and post- summer vacation (S1A Fig), presenting a similar trend as EVI. The incidence rates of this syndrome were higher among children of primary and secondary schools but lower than those in preschools (p < 0.001) (S1A Fig).\n\n\nDiarrhea: Diarrhea cases were reported at a relatively low frequency, with sporadic peaks presented in spring and autumn. No similarity in trends of diarrhea was identified among the four different age groups (S1B Fig).\n\nThe SID-SSS in Taipei is a cost-effective electronic system. Fees spent on traditional facsimile communication were US$13,200 annually. In 2009, consumables including paper and ink cost US$2,772. The total operation costs on equipment and supplies decreased 95.5% (from US$15,972 in 2009 to US$720 in 2010). Time invested from data recruitment to analysis was 1,788 hours per month on average under the paper-format system, but reduced to 720 hours per month with the SID-SSS. There had been a 120-minute gap from data processing to the commencement of infection controls using traditional reporting, but such a gap was shortened to only 20 minutes with the SID-SSS.\n\nThe original databank is established and provided by Department of Health, Taipei City Government, Taiwan, Republic of China (R.O.C.)."}
