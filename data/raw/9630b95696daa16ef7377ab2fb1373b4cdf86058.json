{"title": "The eect of smoking on in\u00afuenza, in\u00afuenza vaccination ecacy and on the antibody response to in\u00afuenza vaccination", "body": "Some studies found smokers to be more susceptible to in\u00afuenza compared to non-smokers [1\u00b13] . These studies were held among healthy young men [1, 2] and among a general population with a mean age of 44 years [3, 4] . Since 95% of the deaths due to in\u00afuenza occur among people aged 60 years and older [5] , we focused on the eect of smoking on in\u00afuenza and on the ecacy of in\u00afuenza vaccination in this age group.\n\nMorbidity after in\u00afuenza vaccination in the elderly was signi\u00aecantly reduced in cohort studies and in a randomized controlled trial [6, 7] . It is unknown if smoking in this group in\u00afuences the ecacy of in\u00afuenza vaccination.\n\nThe antibody response that follows immunization with in\u00afuenza vaccine is similar in smokers and non smokers during the \u00aerst three months [8] , but shows a greater decline in antibody titres after one year in smokers [3, 9] . The impaired persistence of serum antibody in smokers after immunization with in\u00afuenza vaccine could in\u00afuence the ecacy of the vaccine in preventing in\u00afuenza.\n\nThe objective of this study is to examine the relation between cigarette smoking and (1) the occurrence of in\u00afuenza, (2) the ecacy of in\u00afuenza vaccination and (3) the antibody response to in\u00afuenza vaccination. The data for this study were derived from a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial evaluating the ecacy of in\u00afuenza vaccination in elderly individuals [7] . We analyzed the eect of smoking on in\u00afuenza risk, the eect of smoking on vaccine ecacy with clinical as well as serological outcomes and the eect of smoking on the antibody response to vaccination after 3 weeks (rate of increase) and 5 months (rate of decline).\n\nIn the winter of 1991\u00b11992 a randomized clinical trial of the ecacy of in\u00afuenza vaccination in the elderly was conducted, involving 31 general practitioners in 15 practices in South-Limburg, the Netherlands. Persons aged 60 or more were invited to participate if they did not belong to those high-risk groups in which vaccination was recommended (in the Netherlands age was no criterion for recommendation at that time) [10] . A total of 1838 patients agreed to participate. This group contained 490 patients with heart conditions, lung conditions, or diabetes mellitus who were not considered to belong to the high-risk groups by their general practitioner. The analysis was restricted to subjects not previously vaccinated. Details about the recruiting of patients have been described previously [7] .\n\nThe protocol was approved by the medical ethics committee of the University of Limburg and the University Hospital, Maastricht, the Netherlands. Informed consent was obtained and forms were signed by all participants.\n\nThe research period covered \u00aeve months (November 1991 until April 1992 . Patients were vaccinated with 0.5 ml of puri\u00aeed split-virion vaccine (n = 927, A/ Singapore/6/86 (H1N1), A/Beijing/353/89 (H3N2), B/ Panama/45/90 and B/Beijing/1/87 (each strain with 15 mg of hemagglutinin)) or intramuscular placebo (n = 911, physiological saline solution) according to a randomization protocol. Between November 1 and 15, 1991, 9 ml of venous blood was taken from all participants (pre-titre) before vaccine or placebo was injected. Three weeks later a second blood sample was taken (post-titre). At the end of the follow up, 5 months after vaccination, a \u00aenal blood sample was taken (endtitre).\n\nA total of 223 patients indicated to have been vaccinated previously in 1989 and/or 1990.\n\nA questionnaire on smoking habits was sent to all participants 10 weeks after the start of the investigation. A total of 1756 subjects (96%) returned this questionnaire.\n\nThe information gathered about smoking status comprised current smoking status, past smoking status, smoking of cigars, pipe or cigarettes and the amount of cigarettes smoked every day (1\u00b19 per day, 10\u00b119 per day, 20+ per day). Never-smokers and exsmokers were grouped as non-smokers, cigarette smokers as smokers, leaving a rest group. The rest group consisted of pipe and cigar smokers who did not smoke cigarettes currently or previously.\n\nThe antibody titres to the in\u00afuenza strains in the vaccine were measured by means of the hemagglutinin inhibition test. The titres were expressed as the reciprocal values of dilution, of which 50% of hemagglutinin inhibition occurred after addition of 3 hemagglutinating units of antigen. Titres less than 9 were arbitrarily set to 5. The mean logarithmic titre value for the sera was calculated from the serum levels to ensure a normally distributed range of titre values used in the statistical analyses. The serum levels were independently measured by two analysts. This was done for all sera from all samples for each individual strain. Dierences in logarithmic titres were calculated for smokers compared to non-smokers. Increases in logarithmic titre values were calculated from pre-titre to post-titre and post-titre to end-titre.\n\nA titre of 38 or greater and a fourfold titre increase in end-titre relative to post-titre were taken as the criteria of serological in\u00afuenza infection [11] .\n\nA questionnaire regarding possible in\u00afuenza episodes and symptoms was sent to all participants 10 and 23 weeks after vaccination. Three criteria were used to diagnose clinical in\u00afuenza: in\u00afuenza according to the family physician, Dutch Sentinel Stations, and the International Classi\u00aecation of Health Problems in Primary Care (ICHPPC-2-de\u00aened). ICHPPC-2 de\u00aened in\u00afuenza is the least rigid criterion and may cause a false-positive diagnosis of in\u00afuenza for many patients [7] . In\u00afuenza according to the family physician could only be diagnosed if patients consulted the physician during the follow-up period, possibly missing patients with in\u00afuenza not visiting their physician. Criteria to diagnose clinical in\u00afuenza were therefore restricted to criteria of the Dutch Sentinel Stations in this analysis.\n\nThese criteria include an acute onset of symptoms, fever of at least 388C measured rectally and at least one of the following symptoms: coughing, coryza, sore throat, frontal headache, retrosternal pain or myalgia [12] .\n\nA series of control variables was available to see if alternative explanations might exist for the relations of interest. These variables were age, sex, risk group, protective titre before vaccination and current vaccination status. Risk groups were categorized as heart conditions, lung conditions, diabetes mellitus and a group not having those conditions. A titre of 100 or greater for A strains and 200 or greater for B strains was considered to be a protective titre [13] .\n\nThe group used for analysis consisted of 1756 \u00c0 225 (previously vaccinated) = 1531 subjects. In testing a possible relation between smoking and in\u00afuenza strati-\u00aecation by current vaccination status was applied. Data were analyzed separately for the vaccine and the placebo group. The relation between smoking and in\u00afuenza and the ecacy of vaccination in smokers and non-smokers was analyzed, using the odds ratio and the risk dierence. Con\u00aedence limits for the risk dierence were calculated using the formula for cumulative incidence data described by Rothman [14] . Logistic regression was used to correct for age, sex and risk group in the relation between smoking and in\u00afuenza and for age, sex, risk group and protective titre before vaccination in the analyses of vaccination ecacy in the two smoking groups. A trend in the incidence of in\u00afuenza over the smoking categories, non-smoker, 1\u00b19 a day (light smoker), 10\u00b119 a day (moderate smoker) and 20 or more a day (heavy smoker), was evaluated using regression analysis with controlling for age, sex and risk group.\n\nThe dierence in vaccine ecacy between smokers and non-smokers was tested in a logistic regression analysis by evaluating interaction between vaccination and smoking, controlling for age, sex, risk group. This was done using the likelihood ratio test as described by Kleinbaum [15] .\n\nAntibody response was expressed as the mean change of the individual titre after vaccination (post-titre\u00b1pre-titre) and as the decline after 5 months (end-titre\u00b1post-titre). In analyzing the decline after 5 months subjects who had serological in\u00afuenza (4 fold titre increase) were excluded. Dierences in increases and declines between smokers and non-smokers were tested by t-test for independent groups and ANOVA for each strain controlling for age, sex and risk group. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study subjects, which consisted of 321 smokers, 1152 non-smokers and 58 pipe and/or cigar smokers (rest). The smokers and non-smokers groups were similar with regard to current vaccination status, risk group and protective titre before vaccination. Younger subjects and male subjects were overrepresented among smokers. Serological data were incomplete for 31 participants in the trial population. Subjects with incomplete samples were retained in the analyses whenever possible. Table 2 shows the eect of smoking on serological and clinical in\u00afuenza in previously unvaccinated subjects and categorized by current vaccination status. No statistical signi\u00aecant dierences were found. In the placebo group, a higher rate of serological in\u00afuenza was found in smokers compared to non-smokers. However this dierence was not statistically signi\u00aecant and was not con\u00aermed in the vaccine group (even the reverse was true). The rate of clinical in\u00afuenza did not dier for smokers compared to non-smokers.\n\nThe relation between smoking and in\u00afuenza was further analyzed by using a classi\u00aecation of non-smokers, light smokers (1\u00b19 cigarettes per day), moderate smokers (10\u00b119 per day) and heavy smokers (20 or more per day). The rate of serological in\u00afuenza in the vaccine group was 6% in non-smokers, 3% in light smokers, 3% in moderate smokers and 0% in heavy smokers (trend p = 0.10). In the placebo group serological in\u00afuenza increased from 9% in non-smokers to 11% in light smokers, 13% in moderate smokers and 15% in heavy smokers (trend p = 0.13). No trends were found for clinical in\u00afuenza. Table 3 shows the ecacy of vaccination in smokers and in non-smokers. The data do not con\u00aerm the hypothesis that smoking attenuates vaccine ecacy. Rather the reverse was true when serological in\u00afuenza was the outcome measure. Vaccinated smokers were more protected against serological in\u00afuenza (corrected OR = 0.17) than were vaccinated non-smokers (corrected OR = 0.71). This dierence in ecacy between smokers and non-smokers was statistically signi\u00aecant (likelihood ratio test p < 0.0001; corrected for age, sex and risk group). When clinical in\u00afuenza was the outcome measure no dierence in ecacy of vaccination was found between smokers and non-smokers (likelihood ratio test p = 0.46; corrected for age, sex and risk group). Table 4 shows the mean logarithmic titre change, from pre-titre to post-titre and from post-titre to endtitre, in the vaccine group for smokers compared with non-smokers. No great dierences were found in pretitres for smokers compared to non-smokers (adjusted for age, sex and risk group). The rise in titre after vaccination was statistically signi\u00aecantly higher in smokers for A/Singapore/6/86 and B/Beijing/11/87, but not for A/Beijing/353/89 and B/Panama/45/90. For all strains the post to end-titre decline was marginally higher in smokers. The end-titre was still slightly higher in smokers compared to non-smokers for B/Panama/45/90 and B/Beijing/11/87 and statistically signi\u00aecantly higher for A/Singapore/6/86 (P = 0.04, adjusted for age, sex and risk group).\n\nIn this study smokers did not have a greater incidence of serological or clinical in\u00afuenza compared to non-smokers. Odds ratios for smoking and serological in\u00afuenza were estimated from the serological data depicted in the studies of Finklea et al. [1] , Kark et al. [2] , and MacKenzie et al. [3] . These ORs were 1.3, 1.4 and 1.9, respectively, and are comparable to the odds ratio of 1.61 found in our study in the group receiving no real vaccination (placebo group). These results are consistent with the idea that the OR for the relation between smoking and in\u00afuenza is somewhere between 1 and 2, indicating that the eect is small. In our study no trend among the dierent smoking categories was found with serological or clinical in\u00afuenza as outcome variables. Smoking had no eect on clinical in\u00afuenza in our study. However, Finklea et al. and Kark et al. did \u00aend a relationship between smoking and clinical in\u00afuenza (odds ratios of about 1.5, p < 0.05 and 2.42, p < 0.0001 respectively).\n\nAn eect of smoking on in\u00afuenza would be more plausible if smoking in\u00afuences the susceptibility to other viral infections as well. Cohen et al. found that smokers were at greater risk for getting common colds than non-smokers [16] . Smokers were more likely both to develop infection with rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronavirus (OR = 2.23; 95% CI = 1.03, 4.82) and to develop illness following infection with these viruses (OR = 1.83; 95% CI = 1.00, 3.36). In their review on cigarette smoking [17] . To summarize, studies on non-in\u00afuenza respiratory infections consistently show smokers to be at an increased risk. Vaccination of smokers against in\u00afuenza was serologically more ecacious compared to non-smokers in our study (see Table 3 ). As this was not expected and no other studies investigated the ecacy of in\u00afuenza vaccination in smokers and non-smokers, we sought support for this \u00aending in the antibody response after vaccination. A greater titre rise due to vaccination was observed in smokers compared to non-smokers for two out of four strains 3 weeks after vaccination. A greater antibody response was also found by Finklea et al. [9] . In their study pre-vaccination titres (that were lower for smokers than non-smokers) leveled up after vaccination. A possible explanation is that smokers develop a better immunological protection after vaccination, resulting in a lower incidence of serological in\u00afuenza compared to non-smokers. The clinical relevance of this \u00aending appears to be low, because no dierence in ecacy of vaccination was found for clinical in\u00afuenza between smokers and non-smokers in our study. Also, MacKenzie et al. and Knowles et al. found no greater antibody response in smokers compared to non-smokers after vaccination with in\u00afuenza vaccine [3, 8] . Instead, hepatitis B vaccination has been shown to be less immunogenic in smokers versus nonsmokers in several studies [18\u00b120]. For example, for subjects receiving hepatitis B vaccine at 0, 1 and 6 months (standard schedule) it was found that vaccinated smokers had lower antibody levels than nonsmokers after 3, 7 and 13 months [18] . In summary, the tendency for smokers to have a higher antibody response than non-smokers found in our study is not found in other studies on in\u00afuenza vaccination (except Finklea et al.) and hepatitis B vaccination. The greater protection against serological in\u00afuenza in smokers Table 3 The ecacy of vaccination in smoker and non-smoker for people not previously vaccinated (rate as %) [14] . e Not corrected for covariables. f Corrected for age, sex, risk group and protective titre before vaccination. g Dierence in ecacy between smoker and non-smoker was signi\u00aecant (likelihood ratio = 11.81; p < 0.005; corrected for age, sex and risk group). Table 2 The eect of smoking on the incidence rate of in\u00afuenza in people not previously vaccinated and strati\u00aeed according to current vaccination status (rate as %) compared to non-smokers found in our study is therefore hardly supported by other immunological data. In our study the decline in titres 5 months after vaccination was similar for smokers and non-smokers, which is consistent with the \u00aending of Knowles et al. after a 3 month follow-up [8] . However, MacKenzie et al. and Finklea et al. found a depressed persistence of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody after 1 year in smokers compared to non-smokers [3, 9] . This raises the question if a depressed antibody titre in smokers compared to non-smokers after vaccination manifests itself only after several months. However, this question can not be decided with our data that covers a period of 5 months.\n\nIt is important to consider potential limitations regarding the internal validity of the design. A possible bias is that the measurement of the smoking status could be in\u00afuenced by the outcome of clinical in\u00afuenza, because smoking status was measured 10 weeks after the start of the investigation. However, the hypotheses about smoking were not known to the patients during the data collection, making it unlikely that patients tried to report their smoking status dierently in order to please the investigators or to try and explain why they got in\u00afuenza. Selection biases are unlikely to occur because the data used in this study resulted from a randomized clinical trial. Beyer et al., Palache, Gross et al. and Poirier et al. pointed out some shortcomings in the research on in\u00afuenza vaccination [6, 21\u00b123] . In many studies on the ecacy of vaccination pre-vaccination titres, previous vaccination status, age, gender and the health status were not taken into account. In our study previously vaccinated patients were excluded, no dierences were found in pre-titres for smokers and non-smokers and corrections were made for age, gender and health status. Also vaccine doses are relevant for the interpretation of the results [23] . These vaccine doses were the same for all subjects. The in\u00afuenza activity in the in\u00afuenza season 1991\u00b11992 in the Netherlands was dominated by the strains A/Singapore/6/86 (H1N1) and A/Beijing/353/89 (H3N2) and therefore matched Geometric mean titre (GMT) = 10 logtitre : change(GMT) = 10 logchangevalue *10 logprevalue \u00c010 logprevalue . a CI indicates con\u00aedence interval. b Corrected for age, sex and risk group, but not for protective titre before vaccination (possible intermediate factor). c Subjects with serological in\u00afuenza were excluded (=a titre at end-titre r4 times the titre at post-titre) causing a small dierence to occur in the post-titre used in post-titre\u00b1pre-titre compared to the post-titre used in end-titre\u00b1post-titre. at least two of the strains used in the vaccine for that season [24] . In summary, no real threats to the validity of our results are found.\n\nNo strong eects were found in this study. A slightly elevated, but not signi\u00aecant, risk for serological in\u00afuenza in the placebo group was found in smokers compared to non-smokers. This was consistent with previous studies, but did not result in a clinical dierence. Smokers were better protected than non-smokers against serological in\u00afuenza after vaccination and titre rise due to vaccination was higher in smokers than non-smokers for some (but not all) strains. However, little support for this \u00aending was found in the antibody response after vaccination in previous studies on in\u00afuenza or other infectious diseases. Finally, smokers did not have a lower immune titre 5 months after vaccination compared to non-smokers. We conclude that smoking may enhance the immunological response to vaccination in smokers, resulting in a higher protection against serological in\u00afuenza in smokers compared to non-smokers. Nevertheless, we found no clinically sig-ni\u00aecant eect of smoking on risk of in\u00afuenza and vaccine ecacy."}
