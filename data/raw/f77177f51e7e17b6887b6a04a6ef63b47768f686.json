{"title": "The role of influenza, RSV and other common respiratory viruses in severe acute respiratory infections and influenza-like illness in a population with a high HIV sero-prevalence, South Africa 2012-2015 HHS Public Access", "body": "Pneumonia is a leading cause of childhood mortality globally, with about 1.6 million new cases per year, of which 1.2 million occur in the developing world [1] and approximately 10% are severe enough to require hospitalization [1] . Before the worldwide availability of vaccines, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) and Haemophilus influenzae type b were identified as the main bacterial causes of pneumonia [1, 2] . Now, viruses are more commonly detected in patients with acute respiratory infections including pneumonia [1, 3, 4] . [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . While the use of sensitive PCR methods has significantly expanded the ability of laboratories to detect and identify pathogens, the clinical association between pathogen detection and disease remains difficult to interpret when considering viral shedding, replication and persistence of nucleic acids present during the pre-or post-syndromic phase of infection in the absence of comparison groups [3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 14] . Without comparing to control groups, the clinical relevance of identifying some respiratory pathogens by PCR testing remains difficult to determine [3, 4, 11, 12, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .\n\nUnderstanding the contribution of respiratory viruses to illness would allow the prioritization of respiratory pathogens for inclusion in diagnostic tests, disease surveillance, vaccine development and treatment.\n\nTo the attributable fraction of 10 common respiratory viruses among patients hospitalized with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) compared to control subjects.\n\nSARI surveillance-Study samples were obtained from participants enrolled in a prospective hospital-based surveillance program for SARI initiated in February 2009. The methodology and case definition of this study has been previously described [8, 19] . For this study participants were enrolled at 3 public hospitals in 2 provinces of South Africa (Edendale Hospital, KwaZulu-Natal Province; and Klerksdorp and Tshepong Hospitals, North West Province) from May 2012 through April 2015.\n\nILI and control surveillance-Study samples were obtained from participants enrolled in an active surveillance program for ILI and controls initiated in May 2012 and running through April 2015. The methodology and case definitions of this study have been as previously described [14] . Patients presenting with ILI and controls were enrolled at two outpatient clinics in the same catchment area to the above mentioned hospitals: Edendale Gateway Clinic, KwaZulu-Natal Province, and Jouberton Clinic, North West Province. An ILI case was defined as an outpatient of any age presenting with either temperature >38 \u00b0C or history of fever, and cough of duration of \u22647 days.\n\nA control was defined as an individual presenting at the same outpatient clinic with no history of fever, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms during the 14 days preceding the visit. We aimed to enroll one HIV-infected and one HIV-uninfected control every week in each clinic within each of the following age categories: 0-1, 2-4, 5-14, 15-54 and \u226555 years.\n\nNasopharyngeal aspirates for children <5 years of age and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from individuals \u22655 years of age were collected from all enrolled patients (SARI, ILI and Controls), placed in viral transport medium, stored at 4-8 \u00b0C. All specimens were tested for the presence of 10 respiratory viruses (influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1-3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus; rhinovirus; human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and enterovirus) using a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay [8] . Among consenting study patients, HIV status was established by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or PCR assay depending on the patients' age [19] .\n\nWe implemented a multivariable multinomial regression model to determine the association between specific respiratory viruses among patients with SARI or ILI compared to controls enrolled from May 2012 through April 2015. Multinomial regression allows modeling of outcome variables with more than 2 categories and relates the probability of being in category j to the probability of being in a baseline or reference category. A complete set of coefficients are estimated for each of the j levels (patients with ILI or SARI in this analysis) that are compared with the baseline category (controls for this analysis) and the effect of each predictor in the model is measured as relative risk ratio (RRR). The association of the 10 viruses with mild (ILI) or severe (SARI) illness was assessed simultaneously using a multivariable model to adjust for the potential effect of co-infections. In addition, all estimates were adjusted for age (<1, 1-4, 5-24, 25-44, 45-64 and \u226565 years of age), HIV serostatus and underlying medical conditions other than HIV.\n\nIn addition, we implemented an age-stratified analysis among individuals aged <5 and \u22655 years of age to evaluate potential differences in disease association in young children and older individuals. For both analyses we also adjusted the effect of the viral covariates by age within each age strata (<1 and 1-4 years of age for children aged <5 years and 5-24, 25-44, 45-64 and \u226565 years of age for persons aged \u22655 years), HIV serostatus and underlying medical conditions other than HIV.\n\nSubsequently we estimated the attributable fraction (AF) from the relative risk (RR) obtained from the multinomial model for each virus using the following formula: AF = (RR \u2212 1)/RR\u00d7100. Lastly, we adjusted the observed detection rate (Prev Obs = n/N) for each virus among ILI or SARI cases by the corresponding AF to obtain the prevalence of each virus attributable to mild (ILI) or severe (SARI) illness (adjusted prevalence, Prev Illness ) using the following formula: Prev Illness = Prev Obs \u00d7AF/100. The analysis was performed using STATA 13.1 (StataCorp \u00ae , Texas, USA).\n\nOver the study period, we enrolled 1959 SARI cases, 3784 ILI cases and 1793 controls. \n\nIn the main unstratified analysis using multivariable multinomial regression, all viruses except adenovirus where significantly associated with mild illness (ILI) and all viruses except PIV2 were associated with severe illness (SARI) ( Tables 1 and 4) . Nonetheless, the level of association (i.e., magnitude of the AF) varied across pathogens. Among ILI cases the AF was highest for influenza (adjusted AF [aAF]: 93.3%; 95% confidence intervals [95%CI]: 89.6-95.7%), PIV2 (aAF: 90.8%; 95%CI: 60.5-97.9%) and hMPV (aAF: 86.6%; 95%CI: 74.9-92.9%) ( Table 4 ). Among SARI cases the AF was highest for influenza (aAF: 86.3%; 95%CI: 77.7-91.6%), hMPV (aAF: 85.6%; 95%CI: 72.0-92.6%), and RSV (aAF: 83.7%; 95%CI: 77.5-88.2%) ( Table 4 ).\n\nIn the age stratified analysis among children <5 years of age all viruses except adenovirus and enterovirus where significantly associated with mild illness (ILI) and all viruses except PIV2 were associated with severe illness (SARI) (Tables 2 and 4). Among SARI cases <5 years of age, the highest significant AF (\u226590%) were observed for influenza, hMPV and RSV, while the lowest significant AF was observed for enterovirus (38.2%) ( Table 4 ). In this group among viruses with significant AF the estimated detection rate attributable to illness (adjusted prevalence) was 22.4% for RSV, 18.1% for rhinovirus, 10.1% for adenovirus, 5.2% for hMPV, 4.7% for influenza, 2.9% for PIV3, 2.8% for enterovirus and 2.4% for PIV1 (Table 4) .\n\nAmong individuals \u22655 years of age adenovirus, RSV and PIV1 were not significantly associated with mild illness (ILI) and adenovirus, PIV1-3 and hMPV were not significantly associated with severe illness (SARI) ( Tables 3 and 4 ). Among SARI cases \u22655 years of age the highest significant AF (>80%) were observed for enterovirus and influenza, while the lowest significant AF was observed for rhinovirus (42.7%). In this group among viruses with significant AF the estimated detection rate attributable to illness was 8.1% for rhinovirus, 5.9% for influenza, 3.4% for RSV, and 2.2% for enterovirus (Table 4) .\n\nAmong ILI cases influenza had the highest AF and estimated prevalence associated with illness among children <5 years (AF: 95.8%; Prev Illness : 13.9%) as well as individuals \u22655 years (AF: 91.9%; Prev Illness : 14.5%) ( Table 4 ).\n\nWe assessed the association between virus detection and mild or severe illness relative to controls. The estimated detection rate attributable to illness reported in this study reflects a more accurate description of the prevalence of viruses causing respiratory disease in both children and adults in South Africa than reporting viral detection rates alone. Most of the viral pathogens evaluated in this study were found to be associated with mild or severe disease irrespective of HIV status. Nonetheless, the magnitude of this association varied between pathogens. Our study suggest that influenza, RSV and hMPV infections are highly associated with severe respiratory illness in South Africa relative to controls, especially in children <5 years of age, which mirror the findings of Self et al. [12] . While rhinovirus and adenovirus had the lowest estimated AF the estimated detection rate attributable to illness remained high indicating that, while these viruses could act both as pathogen and bystander, they could also be responsible for a substantial proportion of severe disease. RSV, rhinovirus, adenovirus, hMPV and influenza were the most common pathogens causing disease among SARI cases, especially in children <5 years of age.\n\nOur findings differ from similar studies which used multiplex PCR to detect a viral aetiology in non-invasive respiratory specimens relative to a control group, where fewer viruses were associated with disease. A study conducted among children \u226412 years of age hospitalized with pneumonia in the Kilifi District hospital in Kenya [6] reported that only RSV (identified in 34% of cases) was associated with disease as well as a case-control study conducted among children \u226459 months in rural Kenya [11] . Conversely, another study conducted in children reported that RSV and influenza were more commonly found among cases than controls [20] . In adults RSV, influenza, and hMPV have been shown to be associated with disease [21] . It should be noted that these studies had a limited number of controls potentially resulting in a lack of power to detect significant disease association for pathogens with low detection rates.\n\nIn our study RSV was found to be significantly associated with severe respiratory disease relative to controls. RSV has been well documented as the leading cause of viral pneumonia in children <5 years of age [1, 22] , but is also increasingly recognized as a cause of severe disease in adults [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Several studies have shown that RSV infection is an important cause of illness in the elderly (\u226565 years) and high-risk adults, with a disease burden similar to that of non-pandemic seasonal influenza [26,28]. Although we found that RSV was associated with disease among both children and adults, modeling studies conducted in South Africa have not found excess mortality or hospitalizations associated with RSV among adults [29, 30] . This apparent contradiction may relate to the fact that the burden of RSV among older adults in South Africa may be too low to be detected in modeling studies.\n\nWhile rhinovirus has been shown to be less associated with illness (low attributable fraction) in both children and adults, the estimated detection rate attributable to illness remained elevated when compared to other pathogens, suggesting that rhinovirus may still causes a substantial proportion of clinical disease that manifests either as ILI or SARI. The high prevalence of rhinovirus among controls indicates that rhinovirus may potentially have an extended shedding period and can be detected in patients without symptoms. Several studies have reported the high positivity rate of rhinovirus in asymptomatic individuals and none so far have been able to give a clear indication of rhinovirus' role in severe respiratory infection, although several have suggested that rhinovirus can act as both a bystander and a pathogen [12, [31] [32] [33] [34] . Similar results were obtained for adenovirus in this study [18] .\n\nIn our study, influenza and hMPV were found to be significantly associated with severe disease among children less than 5 years of age. Influenza has been described as one of the leading causes of pneumonia in children, the elderly, and adults with HIV infection [1, 19, 35, 36] . Since 2001, hMPV has been reported worldwide. However, so far studies of hMPV have been limited; although it has been suggested that hMPV mirrors the epidemiology of RSV and influenza with more severe infections occurring in the very young, elderly and immune-compromised individuals [37,38].\n\nOur study has limitations that warrant discussion. First, several viruses were detected at low prevalence in the control group which would account not only for the high adjusted relative risk ratios but also for the wide confidence intervals. Second, comparing detection rate of pathogens among symptomatic patients with controls does not prove or disprove disease association in individual patients. Other approaches such as viral load and host interactions are needed to determine what role some of these viruses play in severe respiratory disease, while taking into account factors such as replication or persistence of nucleic acids present during the pre-or post syndromic phase of infection. Third, we did not adjust for the potential role of bacterial infections as this information was not available. The role of bacterial super-infection on severe illness following a viral infection cannot be excluded. Last, whereas on multivariable analysis we adjusted for the HIV serostatus of the individuals enrolled in this study, we were not powered to provide estimates of the AF stratified by HIV due to the low detection rate of certain pathogens within each stratum.\n\nIn conclusion, influenza, RSV and hMPV can be considered likely pathogens if detected in South African patients with ILI or SARI; whereas rhinovirus and adenovirus were commonly identified also among controls suggesting that they may cause only a proportion of clinical disease observed in positive patients. Nonetheless, given their high estimated detection rate attributable to illness, they may be important contributors to disease. This data together with other matched case-control studies like PERCH (Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health) [16] will provide useful information on how each pathogen impacts disease severity and may assist to better interpret surveillance data, to prioritize pathogens to be included in surveillance programs and to guide prevention interventions.
