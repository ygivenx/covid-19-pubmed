{"title": "A Rare Case of Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2 in a Child\nWith Persistent Fatigue", "body": "This is a case report requiring only chart review and literature review, without\nany direct intervention or harm to the patient referred to in this case, and as\nsuch, informed consent and ethical approval was not needed.\n\nA 15-year-old male presented to a local hospital with fatigue, fever, abdominal pain,\nnausea, and vomiting for a few days prior to presentation. He reported a severe\nviral illness roughly 6 weeks prior to his presentation. Laboratory studies in the\nemergency department were significant for hyponatremia and an elevated\nthyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The remaining results, including complete blood\ncount, hepatic panel, lactic acid, lipase, infectious mono screen, and creatine\nkinase level, were all normal. A chest radiograph and abdominal ultrasound were both\nunremarkable, and he was admitted.\n\nFurther history revealed recent gait instability as well as a change in skin color\nfor a few weeks preceding presentation. Physical examination was significant for\ngeneralized pallor and a dusky gray appearance, generalized abdominal tenderness,\nand right-sided CVA tenderness. Because hyponatremia in the context of nausea,\nvomiting, fatigue, and skin color changes raised suspicion for Addison\u2019s disease, a\ncomprehensive metabolic panel and early morning cortisol were ordered.\n\nThe next day he had documented pigmentation of the lower lip and both nipples.\nFurther laboratory evaluation revealed positive thyroid peroxidase antibody,\nelevated ACTH, cortisol levels nonresponsive to cosyntropin, and persistent\nhyponatremia and hyperkalemia (see the Appendix for pertinent laboratory values.).\nLaboratory data were consistent with primary adrenal insufficiency and Hashimoto\u2019s\nthyroiditis. Hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone were initiated for glucocorticoid\nand mineralocorticoid replacement, respectively. Because adrenal dysfunction and\nacute illness can elevate the TSH, the putative Hashimoto\u2019s disease was not treated.\nThyroid hormone replacement was also held to prevent adrenal crisis from stimulation\nof the patient\u2019s metabolism with thyroid hormone. A respiratory virus panel was\npositive for coronavirus, which might have precipitated the acute illness. Direct\nrenin level was elevated, and the aldosterone level was low. By day 3, his\nelectrolyte abnormalities and clinical status improved significantly, so he was\ndischarged.\n\nAt outpatient follow-up, very long chain fatty acids were normal, eliminating\nadrenoleukodystrophy as a possible etiology for the adrenal insufficiency. The\ndiabetes autoimmune test group was normal, but the TSH remained elevated with a\nnormal T4, confirming autoimmune hypothyroidism. Follicle-stimulating hormone and\nluteinizing hormone were normal, eliminating concomitant hypogonadism, but tissue\ntransglutaminase immunoglobulin A was elevated, raising suspicion for celiac\ndisease. Levothyroxine was started and he was referred for intestinal biopsy to\nconfirm celiac disease.\n\nThe diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency requires a high index of suspicion. In our\ncase, a 15-year-old male presented with nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints,\nfatigue, and skin color changes with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Our\ninvestigation confirmed adrenal insufficiency and ultimately led to a diagnosis of\nAPS type 2. Adrenal insufficiency and APS type 2 are rare diagnoses in the pediatric\nand adolescent population, although both disorders have been described in\nchildren.4,8-11\n\nOther investigators have emphasized the wide ranging clinical and laboratory findings\nassociated with adrenal insufficiency, the importance of screening for\nadrenoleukodystrophy, the importance of alterations in glucose levels, and insulin\nrequirements in type 1 diabetes as it relates to surveillance, and determining\netiology and screening for concomitant disorders.4,8-11\n\nAlthough APS type 2 has been reported,12-15 there are few reports of\npediatric patients.14,15 There is a need for continued surveillance over a lifetime, as\nthere is potential for development of other autoimmune disorders even decades after\nthe initial diagnosis.\n\nIn a study of 18 pediatric patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, hypotension\nwas the presenting sign in 13, hyperpigmentation in 12, hyponatremia in 16, and\nhyperkalemia in 9. Of 15 who underwent a cosyntropin stimulation test, all failed.16 Our patient did not have hypotension, yet he had hyperpigmentation,\nhyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and failed a cosyntropin stimulation test.\n\nThe Endocrine Society recently published a clinical practice guideline that details\nrecommendations for both diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency.2 The cosyntropin stimulation test is recommended for establishing the\ndiagnosis of adrenal insufficiency, together with measurement of plasma ACTH, renin,\nand aldosterone levels.2 Treatment includes replacement of both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid\nhormones with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone, respectively.2\n\nNumerous are the etiologies of primary adrenal insufficiency, including autoimmune\n(isolated or part of APS), adrenal injury, infectious, congenital adrenal\nhyperplasia, drug-induced, or metabolic disorders such as mitochondrial diseases or adrenoleukodystrophy.2 Thus, effective treatment must be directed toward the underlying cause.\n\nWhen initiating hormone therapy for treatment of an APS with both adrenal\ninsufficiency and thyroid disease, it is important to be aware that thyroid hormone\ntherapy can initially cause an adrenal crisis with stimulation of increased\nmetabolism of corticosteroids by the hepatic system. Thus, thyroid hormone\nreplacement is usually postponed until appropriate adrenal hormone replacement has occurred.3\n\nAdrenal insufficiency is a rare diagnosis in pediatric patients and timely diagnosis\nis crucial to prevent life-threatening complications. Clinicians must maintain a\nhigh index of suspicion when there are any signs, symptoms, or laboratory findings\nsuggesting adrenal pathology. Once the diagnosis is made, it is imperative to\ndetermine etiology. The presence of adrenal antibodies confirms an autoimmune cause.\nAutoimmune adrenal disease may be isolated or associated with a cluster of other\nautoimmune diseases referred to as APS. It is important to screen for other\nautoimmune diseases in patients with confirmed autoimmune adrenal insufficiency to\nadequately treat these patients and avoid complications and sequela."}
