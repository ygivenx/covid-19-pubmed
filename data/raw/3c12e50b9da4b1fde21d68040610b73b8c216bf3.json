{"title": "Structure-Guided Mutagenesis Alters Deubiquitinating Activity 2 and Attenuates Pathogenesis of a Murine Coronavirus", "body": "Since one of the primary goals of this study is to understand the contribution of DUB 118 activity to viral replication and pathogenesis, we next focused on quantitating further the effects 119 of the D1772A mutant on the steady-state kinetic parameters of MHV PLP2 toward the three 120 different substrates (Fig. 2B) . The RLRGG-AMC peptide substrate is often used as surrogate of 121 the viral polyprotein substrate and the kinetic data in Fig. 2B show that this substrate is still well-122 recognized and cleaved by the D1772A mutant. In fact, we observed a small rate enhancement in 123 the catalytic efficiency (i.e., kcat/Km) compared to the wild-type enzyme.\n\nThe Ub-AMC substrate, on the other hand, is poorly recognized and cleaved by the 125 D1772A mutant compared to the wild-type enzyme. The wild-type enzyme normally interacts 126 strongly with Ub-AMC with a Km value of 0.67 \u00b5M. However, mutation of D1772 to an alanine 127 significantly disrupts the interaction with ubiquitin, making it impossible to saturate MHV PLP2 128 All rights reserved.

The net result is a significant reduction in the 129 catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) compared to the wild-type enzyme, which was the goal of these trials. 130 The kinetic response of MHV PLP2 toward another substrate, ISG15-AMC, was also 131 determined. ISG15 is an important ubiquitin-like modifier that is upregulated and used to ISGylate 132 host proteins during viral infection. A number of viruses, including coronaviruses, engender 133 ISGylation during infection but the function(s) and importance of this activity are not clear 30). For MHV, neither the wild-type nor the D1772A mutant PLP2 enzyme can be saturated with 135 ISG15-AMC, suggesting weak binding with this ubiquitin-like modifier (Fig. 2B) . Moreover, the 136 R1772A mutation does not disrupt the interaction with ISG15 but in fact enhances it to some 137 degree. A potential explanation for the observed selective disruption of ubiquitin binding stems 138 from our analysis of a primary sequence alignment of ubiquitin and ISG15 and the residues that 139 interact with D1772 (Fig. 2C ). The interaction between MHV PLP2 D1772 and the R42 residue in 140 human and mouse ubiquitin is absent in human and mouse ISG15 since this residue is a tryptophan 141 in human and mouse ISG15. Therefore, in line with our observations, D1772A mutation would 142 not be expected to alter ISG15 binding. In contrast to R42, residue R72 is conserved in both 143 ubiquitin and ISG15 and its interaction with MHV PLP2 for ubiquitin is likely weaker than that 144 with ISG15.\n\n146 culture based assays. The in vitro biochemical studies presented here support the notion that we 147 are able to use a structure-guided mutagenesis to uncouple the DUB enzymatic activity from MHV 148 PLP2 while preserving the peptide hydrolysis and deISGylating activities of PLP2. Next, we 149 focused on comparing the activity of the mutant enzyme to its wild-type counterpart for the ability 150 to remove Flag-tagged-ubiquitin conjugated to host proteins in cultured cells (Fig. 3A) . We found 8 that in cells, wild-type PLP2 exhibits robust DUB activity and removes ubiquitin modifications 152 from multiple cellular proteins. On the other hand, the PLP2-D1772A mutant exhibits reduced 153 DUB activity, similar to that of the previously documented catalytic cysteine to alanine mutant, 154 PLP2-CA (19). To determine if this impaired DUB activity altered the ability of PLP2 to act as an 155 interferon antagonist, we transfected cells with a RIG-I expression plasmid, an interferon-156 luciferase reporter construct, and either wild-type or mutant PLP2 plasmid and measured luciferase 157 activity at 18 hours post-transfection. In agreement with previous reports (13, 25, 31), we find that 158 wild-type PLP2 acts as an interferon antagonist, reducing reporter activity by 50-80%. In contrast, 159 PLP2-D1772A is unable to significantly reduce interferon activation in this assay despite similar 160 expression levels of the wild-type and mutant versions of the protein (Fig. 3B ). We also evaluated 161 the protease activity of the enzymes in cells using two independent trans-cleavage assays and 162 found that the wild-type and DUB-mutant enzymes produce similar levels of cleaved products. 163 These results indicate that the D1772A substitution did not alter protease activity (Fig. 3C and D), 164 in agreement with the in vitro kinetic results described above (Fig. 2) . Together, these studies 165 reveal that aspartic acid residue 1772 of MHV-PLP2 is important for DUB activity and interferon 166 antagonism, but not for protease activity.\n\nRecombinant MHV harboring PLP2-D1772A activates an earlier IFN response in bone 168 marrow-derived macrophages. Since the D1772A substitution did not impact protease activity, 169 we reasoned that we should be able to generate recombinant virus containing this substitution, 170 thereby allowing us to determine if the mutation has any effect on viral replication kinetics and 171 interferon antagonism in the context of the live virus. We engineered the mutant virus via reverse 172 genetics (32), performed full genome sequencing to verify the genotype (2 nucleotide changes at 173 positions 5525 and 5526, resulting in D1772A substitution in the replicase polyprotein), and 174 All rights reserved.

Upon evaluating virus replication of the DUBmut virus by 175 performing a growth kinetics experiment in parallel with wild-type virus, we found that the 176 DUBmut virus replicates with essentially identical kinetics as the wild-type in a murine 177 astrocytoma cell line (DBT cells) (Fig. 4A ). These results are consistent with previous studies of 178 coronavirus interferon antagonists, which showed in many cell lines that viral-mediated interferon 179 antagonism is not essential for virus replication (5, 6). Regarding the other ubiquitin-interacting 180 residues identified in the structural analysis, we attempted to rescue virus with substitutions at the 181 F1812 position, but were unable to recover viable virus. These results indicate that F1812 may 182 play a critical role within the polyprotein during virus replication. We were able to recover virus 183 containing the R1803A substitution, but found that it had no detectable phenotype, which we 184 documented in our previous study (5). Here, we focus our efforts on evaluating replication and IFN\uf061\uf020protein into the supernatant, as detected by ELISA (Fig. 4B ). We show that this activation 191 of IFN\uf061 is dependent on expression of pattern recognition receptor MDA5 (Fig. 4D ), in agreement 192 with previous reports (5, 6, 33). To our surprise, we found that replication of DUBmut is not 193 impaired relative to the wild-type virus in BMDMs, as measured by level of nucleocapsid RNA 194 (Fig. 4E ) and evaluation of infectious virus particle production over time in the kinetics assay (Fig. 195 4F). These results demonstrate that an elevated interferon response is generated during replication 196 All rights reserved.

Although we 220 only observed a subtle attenuation of the DUBmut virus in the tested animal models, we 221 demonstrated that PLP2 DUB activity does play a role in suppressing the host immune response 222 and is a virulence trait, strengthening our earlier discoveries on SARS-CoV PLpro (4). We further 223 investigated the differences in the interferon response generated in response to WT versus 224 DUBmut virus in our companion study (Volk et al., submitted) , which further supports a role for 225 DUB activity in modulating the interferon response in macrophages.\n\nThe structure-guided approach used to generate the DUBmut virus allowed for substitution. The deISGylating ability of the enzyme is also not affected. In contrast, the mutant 237 enzyme's deubiquitinating activity is significantly reduced relative to wild-type, which is most 238 likely due to a lowered binding affinity for ubiquitin as the enzyme could not be saturated with 239 Ub-AMC as a substrate. 240 All rights reserved.

Therefore, our finding that the DUBmut virus 257 containing the PLP2-D1772A substitution activates an elevated antiviral response in macrophages 258 compared to the wild-type virus, but that this antiviral state results in only mild attenuation of 259 disease in mice relative to WT infection, was unexpected. Previous studies demonstrated that 260 ubiquitin has important roles in both the activation and the attenuation of innate antiviral pathways 261 (39); therefore, we anticipated a more remarkable phenotype for a DUB-mutant virus. We can 262 imagine several possible explanations for our findings. First, it is possible that viral DUB activity 263 All rights reserved.
