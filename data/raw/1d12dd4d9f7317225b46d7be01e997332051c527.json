{"title": "Aspects of the Developmental Morphology of California Encepha- litis Virus in Cultured Vertebrate and Arthropod Cells and in Mouse Brain", "body": "An electron microscopic study was made of the replication of California encephalitis (La Crosse strain) in cultured vertebrate cells (Vero, African green monkey kidney), in a line of cultured mosquito cells (Aedes albopictus), and in brain tissue of suckling mice. Morphologically similar virus particles, approximately 95 nm in diameter, were encountered in all three systems, and a common mode of virus assembly and maturation appeared to obtain. Virus assembly was shown to occur exclusively at internal cytomembrane interfaces, the Golgi complex appearing as the initial assembly site, which site became less focal as infection progressed due to the proliferation of Golgi smooth membranes and the dilation of cisternae and vesicles. The assembly process involved viral budding into cisternal and vesicular lumina, the virion thereby acquiring its limiting membrane. The envelope of such intracellular virions exhibited a poorly defined fringe, approximately 8 nm in width, which appeared to undergo a maturational change as the virions were discharged from the cell, such that, extracellularly, virions displayed a well-developed fringe, approximately 12 nm wide-a change especially noteworthy in the case of virions in infected mouse brain. The presence was noted in infected Vero cells-and in one instance in an infected mosquito cell-of crescent-shaped segments of thickened cisternal membrane, which possibly represented an early phase of viral assembly in which nucleocapsid aligned itself in close apposition to a membrane segment preparatory t.o the initiation of budding.\n\nIn areas of the cytoplasm adjacent to sites of viral assembly in neurons, a fine granulofibrillar matrix was frequently found, enmeshed in which were numbers of 50-60 nm spherical structures.\n\nIn a low proportion of cells from infected mosquito cutures, dense granulofibrillar masses were found in the cytoplasm. In Vero cells, infection with CE virus was cytolytic, while in A. albopictus cells, no gross cytopathic effects were manifest, and persistently infected cultures developed upon subcultivation.\n\nHowever, less than 10% of challenged mosquito cells became productively infected and for a proportion of these, at least as determined by electron microscopy, the infection was lethal.\n\nTha California encephalitis group of arboviruses includes important agents of human central nervous system disease, yet comparatively little is known about the fundamental biological, structural, and biochemical properties of the group. An original electron microscopic st,udy of Cali- fornia onccphalitis (CE) virus by Murphy and colleagues (196Sa) revealed many unusual fcaturcs of virus developmental morphology, notably, t'he comparatively large size of the virions (98 nm in average diameter, as compared t,o 55 nm and 38 nm for groups A a,nd I3 arboviruses, respectiveIy), their r&tivclg unst,ructured interiors, and their seeming exclusive assembly at internal cytomembrane interfaces. Later, the Bunyamwera viruses were shown to possess essentially similar features (Murphy et al., 1968b) , and in a recent preliminary survey, Holmes (1971) concluded that it was likely that members of the Bunyamwera Supergroup as a whole (W.H.O. Scientific Group on Arboviruses, WHO Tech. Rep. Ser. 396, l-32, 1967) and certain antigenically unrelated viruses such as Anopheles A, possessed common properties of size, structure, and mode of development comparable to those originally described for California encephalitis virus.\n\nIn the present investigation, representing part of a more general study of the ultrastructure and biochemical interactions of the large lipid-containing arboviruses, it was decided to employ CE virus as a model, to consolidate and further extend existing knowledge of the morphology of virus development. An electron microscopic study was made of virus replication in a continuous vertebrate (Vero) and an ecologically relevant invertebrate (A. albopictus) cell line. Information was sought on whether host-dependent nuances of difference obtained in these phylogenetically diverse systems. The utility of the suckling mouse brain system in the study of the morphology of virus replication had been amply demonstrated by Murphy et al. (1968a, b) , in terms of high potential sensitivity to virus infection and high virus yields. In the present study, this in vivo system was studied in parallel with the in vitro systems, in the expectation that a more complete picture of events might be obtained.\n\nThe virus. The La Crosse strain of CE virus was kindly provided by Dr. N. Karabatsos of the Yale Arbovirus Research Unit. This had been passaged 5 times intracerebrally in suckling mice, and for experiments covered in the present report, seed virus derived from 3 additional passages was used. This was in the form of 10% clarified mouse brain suspensions in Hanks' salts plus 1% bovine serum alumen. Titers ranged from 4.5 to 7.5 X 10' PFU/ml. Experimental animals. One-to 2-day-old litters of Swiss albino mice were infected by the intracerebral inoculation of 0.02 ml of a lo-fold dilution of stock virus. Mice were sacrificed and samples of brain tissue taken for electron microscopy at stages from the first appearance of paralysis through to the moribund state, events which occurred on average from 38 to 46 hr post infection.\n\nCell cultures. Cells of the stable African green monkey kidney cell line (Vero) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL-81). Growth medium consisted of Eagle's MEM (Hanks' salts) plus 7.5 % newborn calf serum. MEM (Earle's salts) plus 2% serum was employed as maintenance medium.\n\nCells of the continuous mosquito cell line of A. albopictus (Singh, 1967) derived from insect larvae, were kindly provided by Dr. Arthur Greene, Institute of Medical Rcsearch, Camden, New Jersey. They were cultured in glass prescription bottles using a growth medium formulated by Dr. W. F. Scherer (personal communication) and consisting of 0.65 % lactalbumen hydrolyzate, 0.5% yeast extract, d-glucose 0.4%, heatinactivated newborn calf serum 5%, 1% of a 1.4% sodium bicarbonate solution, all in Hanks' BSS. Cells were cultivated at 30\u00b0C. For maint.enance, the serum content was reduced to 2 %. Assay of infectious virus. A plaque assay based on the procedure of Stim and Henderson (1969) using Vero cell monolayer cultures was employed. Confluent cultures in 2-02 prescription bottles were washed with PBS and inoculated with virus diluted with 1 YO bovine serum albumen in Hanks' salts at pH 7.8. After absorption of 1.5 hr the virus inoculum was removed and an agar overlay medium was added. The overlay medium of Stim and Henderson (1969) was supplemented with lactalbumen hydrolyzate and yeast extract to concentrations of 0.18% and 0.05%. In addition, pancreatin (Came et al., 1969) was added to a concentration of 0.33%. The agar concentration in the overlay was 0.9%. A second agar overlay containing Neutral Red indicator was added following an interval of 2 days. Plaques were read from 3 to 5 days after infection.\n\n(;~~th cu)'ves.

The infectious center assay of Vero cells was similarly conducted.\n\nElectron microscop2/.

In tho mosquit,o ccl1 cultures, the ratio of rclr:w~d t.o cell-associated virus, 24 hours post infrction was 5.S:l, whcr(*:ls in Vfbro cultures this ratio npproximatckd unity.\n\nThe rc>sults of a11 infectious center assay are presclntcd in Table 1 . The pcxrccntnge of infected mosquito ~11s (9.4) was significantly less than that of infected Vero cells (81.0%). It, \\vas calculated that' the yield of virus per infected mosquito cc:lI was a~)proximately 40 PFU/cell, somewhat highcr than a corrrsponding figure 25 PFU per infected Vcro ~11.\n\nThtl outcome of infechion in Vero cells was cell lysis. Cytopathic effects, involving increasing cytoplasmic granularity, eventual detachment from the surface of the culture bottles, first detectable in a small percentage of the cells 24 hr p.i., progressively involved the majority of cells by 48-72 hr p.i. This CE virus-Vero cell interaction contrasted sharply with observations in the infected mosquito cultures. Here, the infection was seemingly moderate, no gross cytopathic effects were apparent, and cultures could be maintained with replenishment of medium for at least 2 weeks without subcultivation. As indicated in Table 2 , such infected cultures could be serially subcultivated yielding cultures which remained persistently infected.\n\nThe replication of virus in suckling mouse brain cells was similar to that recorded by Murphy et al. (1968a) , maximal titers being reached 34-40 hr after infection.\n\nWith specimens harvested before 16 hours post infection, electron microscopy was generally unrewarding. However, at later times, as intra-and extracellular titers reached a maximum, evidence of virus replication was found in a majority of cells and virus was readily observed extracellularly. The Golgi complex appeared to be the cellular site at which virus replication was initiated. As a consequence of infection, a marked dilation of Golgi cisternae and vesicles occurred, concomitant with the proliferation of sheets and tubular elements of smooth unit membranes, presenting numerous sites for virus assembly. Representative of such a situation are the fields depicted in Fig. 2 and 3 , from specimens sampled 20 and 36 hr after infection, respectively. In Fig. 2 &'I. Init,c)~hondrion.

Such a process is suggested in Fig. 5 (arrow) . Extracellular virions, especially as visualized in specimens taken later after infection e.g., in Fig. 4 , appeared to possess ragged, more diffuse, less clearly outlined surfaces than newly elaborated virions within cisternal spaces (Fig. 2) . They also appeared to be more uniformly stained.\n\nA preliminary examination of released virions by the negative contrast technique, employing sodium phosphotungstate as the negative stain, was performed on virions, derived from a 48-hr harvest of infectious tissue culture medium, and semipurified by sedimentation on to a 65% sucrose cushion through a 15% sucrose layer. More or less spherical particles, of mean diameter 110 nm, and possessing an outer fringe approxmately 12 nm wide were observed. A typical virion is shown (Fig. 5, inset) .\n\nA. albopictus cultures were found to display the three major morphological cell types originally described by Singh (1967) with the small round cell type (6-20 km in diameter) predominating to the extent of 55-95% of the total. Nuclei were predominantly spherical, occasionally irregular and stellate, and displayed clumps of randomly dispersed chromatin, and nucleoli which were generally unremarkable.\n\nThe cytoplasmic compartment was generally dense, with extensive granular endoplasmic reticulum, the intracisternal spaces of which were laden with an amorphous product of low density. Microtubules were abundant. Phagocytic vacuoles were a common feature; these contained amorphous globular material and smooth membrane fragments, and in infected cultures frequently showed virus particles at different stages of degradation. Numerous small mitochondria, usually with an open configuration, were commonly observed. Some of the above features are depicted in Fig. 6 . Certain cytoplasmic inclusions were a feature of both infected and uninfected cultures, such as aggregates of parallel fibers in paracrystalline array within cisternae of granular endoplasmic reticulum, representing chitin; occasionally septate junctions (Locke, 1965) \n\nThe low level of virus produced and its rapid release from cells, combined with the fact that only a low percentage of cells were FIG. 1.

Here, cytopathic effects, in terms of vacuolization and smooth membrane proliferation, are similar to those observed in infected Vero cells. Figure 8 depicts a small section of a degenerating cell, 48 hr post infection, in which a dense layer, 12-14 nm thick, appears to be aligned in close apposition to a short segment of smooth membrane, resembling similar membrane modifications in infected Vero cells (as in Fig. 2) . In approximately 7 % of infected cells, prominent dense granulofibrillar cyt,oplasmic masses were found; these were characterized by irregular unstructured margins without limiting membranes (Fig. 9) .\n\nIn the present experiments the morphological cell type which showed evidence of viral replication was of the predominant small round cell type. What the relative susceptability to infection of the other cell types in the cultures, the spindle-shaped and binucleated cells, could not be ascertained. An early stage of infection is depicted in Fig. 10 , in which t,he architecture of the tissue appears normal except for the moderately dilated intercellular spaces containing small groups of virions. In the lower small neuron, two vesicle-enclosed virions are arrowed, one of which lies adjacent to the prominent Golgi complex. Examination of a large number of sections at early stagcts of infection indicated the prccmincrnc~c~ oi the Golgi apparatus as the site of virus assembly. Figures I1 and 12 arc representative.

Scale marker: 500 nm. ~40,000. ch IU-(arrowhead) appears to contain a fine inner fibrillar component, 3-5 nm in width. In the inset (Fig. 11 , lower left) a viral budding process is depicted in a plane of section which indicates continuity of the limiting membrane of the developing virion with the cisternal membrane. Another example of the involvement of the Golgi complex in viral assembly at early stages of infection is shown in Fig. 12 , while at later stages of infection, with increasing cellular vacuolization, viral replication appeared to be topographically more generalized within the cytoplasm (Fig. 13) .\n\nVirions located within vacuoles, cisternae, and other membranous enclosures within the cytoplasm of cells (intracellular vii-ions) possessed relatively smooth undifferentiated limiting membranes (e.g., in Fig. 11-13 ). Virions located in intercellular spaces (extracellular virions), however, appeared to have undergone a modification in their limiting membrane structure insofar as they now exhibited a clearly defined surrounding fringe, about 12 nm in thickness. This is shown in the group of extracellular virions in Fig. 13 , inset, lower right.\n\nA fine granulofibrillar matrix adjacent to areas of viral replication, was a common feature of infected brain cells (Figs. 12-15 ). In such matrices, it was possible to distinguish a fibrillar component, approximately 3 nm in width, which in certain areas appeared wider, 6-7 nm wide, as though assuming a more condensed form (Fig. 15 , center arrow). Numbers of small vesiclelike spherical structures, 5&60 nm in diameter, were found enmeshed within such matrices (Figs. 14 and 15 ). Ribosomes were usually absent.\n\nAspects of virus assembly. Since it was determined that CE virus did not grow to high titers in either of the two-cell culture systems employed in the present study, it became necessary to determine the approximate time at which virus production became maximal. It was reasoned that during this time period, most or all of the morphological features of virus replication would be represented in cells examined by electron microscopy. Inspection of the virus growth curves indicated that cells harvested at times There is little cytopathic effect. apparent at this stage of infection.\n\nII, nucleus; g, Golgi complex; s, synapse at axon terminal.

The evidence strongly suggested that the Golgi complex represented the initial site of virus replication, Virions appeared to form by budding into the lumina of cisternae and vesicles, acquiring their limiting membrane from the host cell membrane system in the process. A noteworthy finding, in brain cells especially, at early stages of infection, was the presence of virions, individually packaged within closefitting membranous enclosures. This feature was previously noted by Murphy et al. (1968a) . The evidence here suggests t'hat these complexes are formed by the segmentation of virus-charged Golgi cisternal elements (Fig. 11) . It seems likely that these, as well as larger groups of virions within vacuoles, migrate to the plasma membrane where discharge of the viral particles occurs by the normal discharge process whereby vesicular contents are extruded from cells (Palade and Bruns, 1968) . Examination of the plasma membrane of infected cells failed to reveal viral budding processes at this site. Nuclear changes were never observed in infected cells.\n\nThe finding in infected Vero cells of discrete segments of thickened cisternal membrane (Fig. 2 ) provided a possible clue to an early stage of the virus assembly process. It is possible that such structures are formed when viral nucleocapsids align themselves in close apposition to segments of cisternal membrane, modified conceivably, by the insertion of viral-specified proteins. The edges of the membrane segment are visualized as fusing as the budding process is completed at the terminal stage of virus assembly. Altered segments of vesicular membrane were described by Becker et al. (1967) in cells infected with avian infections bronchitis virus, a member of the coronavirus group, where they appeared to represent the initial stage of virus assembly. In the present study, stages intermediate between the crescent-shaped membrane complexes and viral buds on pediceller stalks were not encountered. The envelopment of electron-dense spherical nucleoids, so characteristic a feature of Group A arbovirus assembly (Acheson and Tamm, 1967) has not been observed with California encephalitis virus. Prominent inner shells were not encountered, and only occasionally was there the suggestion of a coiled inner component. The granulofibrillar matrix, in which a relatively uniform-sized population of spherical vesiclelike structures was frequently found, was regularly encountered in areas of the cytoplasm adjacent to sites of virus assembly in brain cells. The matrices appeared to be composed mainly of large aggregates of randomly oriented fine filamentous structures, 3-7 nm in width. Their close topographical relationship to sites of viral assembly, in addition to the fact of their absence in uninfected cells, suggests that they may represent accumulation of viral components such as nucleocapsids and smooth membrane elements, from which milieu virions may sometimes be generated. This is suggested in Fig. 15 . Saikku and colleagues (1971) presented evidence suggesting that Inkoo virus, a Finnish subtype of the California encephalitis virus group, possessed a noncubical, filamentous nucleocapsid, the strands of which, in unwound regions measured 2-3 nm in diameter, and in tightly coiled regions measured 7-10 nm. The findings in the present report, while indirect, are not incompatible with those of the Finnish workers. Additional studies with purified CE virus, currently in progress, are clearly necessary to arrive at an unambiguous interpretation of nucleocapsid structure.\n\nAspects of virus maturation. Cell-associated virions, located within vacuoles and closefitting membranous enclosures possessed a relatively smooth trilaminar limiting membrane on an exterior aspect of which was a closely adhering fine halo (as seen, for example in Fig. 3 ). Virions released from cells, on the other hand, appeared to undergo a maturational change in their limiting membrane structure, which became more ragged in appearance, and differentiated to exhibit a fringe of surface projections. This change seems to be accompanied by a redistribution in electron density wit,hin the particle; in general, the limiting membrane complex of \"intracellular\" virions was more densely stained than the interior of the particles, while in extracellular fully mature virions (e.g., in Fig. 13) , the well-developed fringe on the exterior of the particles was less densely stained than their interior aspect. As viewed by the negative contrast technique, this fringe appears to consist of fine spicules or loops, approximately 12 nm in length. The change in surface st'ructure was not as obvious in mosquito cell virions (Fig.  7) , although the ragged outline of a number of viral particlrs (top of figure) suggest a transitional stage.\n\nIn the matter of postassembly membrane changes, recent findings of Shapiro and cwllragucs (1972) are of interest. Working with ,Japanrse encephalitis virus, these workers showd that the viral membrane protein composition changed during morphogwlesis; t'liat the intracellular form of the virus contained two glycoproteins while, in extracellular virions one of the glycoprotrins appcarcd to be deglycosylated or replaced by a polypeptide lacking a carbohydrate moiety.
