{"title": "Structure-Based Exploration and Exploitation of the S 4 Subsite of Norovirus 3CL Protease in the Design of Potent and Permeable Inhibitors", "body": "Human noroviruses belong to the family Caliciviridae and are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis worldwide [1] [2] . They are associated with high morbidity and a heavy economic burden [3] [4] [5] . In developing countries the mortality rate among children <5 years old due to diarrheal disease caused by noroviruses is estimated to account for 71,000 deaths annually [6] [7] [8] . Combating norovirus infections presents a challenge because of the facile foodborne and waterborne transmission of noroviruses, as well as their high genetic diversity and environmental stability [9] [10] . The problem is further exacerbated by the current lack of diagnostics and norovirus-specific therapeutics and prophylactics, or vaccines. Thus, there is an urgent and unmet medical need for the discovery and development of anti-norovirus small-molecule therapeutics and prophylactics [11] [12] [13] [14] , as well as effective vaccines [15] [16] .\n\nBoth viral and host factors can in principle serve as a launching pad for the discovery of anti-norovirus therapeutics [11] [12] [13] [14] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Prominent viral targets that are particularly well-suited as targets for anti-noroviral drug development include the viralencoded 3CL protease (3CLpro) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) because of the essential roles they play in viral replication [18] . Following translation of the viral genome, the viral polyprotein is cleaved by 3CLpro, a cysteine protease with a prototypical catalytic triad (Cys 139, His30, Glu54) and a strong preference for a P 1 Gln (or Glu) residue [21] , to generate structural and nonstructural proteins [22] [23] [24] Norovirus 3CLpro has been the focus of intense investigations and an array of inhibitors of 3CLpro that display anti-norovirus activity have been reported [11] [12] [13] [14] 19] , including peptidyl [25] [26] and macrocyclic [27] [28] transition state inhibitors and transition state mimics [29] .\n\nImportantly, in vivo proof of concept in a mouse model using a dipeptidyl transition state inhibitor of norovirus 3CLpro has also been demonstrated [25] . We describe herein the structure-guided exploration of the S 4 subsite of 3CLpro and the subsequent deployment of structure-activity relationship and biochemical studies in the design and discovery of potent and permeable inhibitors of the enzyme.\n\nThe design and optimization of the inhibitors was informed by the utilization of available crystal structures and the parallel acquisition of additional high resolution Xray crystal structures. Thus, inspection of previously-determined high resolution X-ray crystal structures of dipeptidyl inhibitors bound to norovirus 3CL protease (PDB accession codes 4XBB, 4XBC and 4XBD) [25] revealed that the \"cap\" R group in inhibitor (I) projects toward the S 4 subsite of the enzyme and suggested that its close proximity to a string of hydrophobic amino acids (Ala158, Ala160, Val168 and Ile109) can be exploited through appropriate cap modifications, including the use of sulfonamide functionalities. Additional design considerations included the use of key recognition elements, such as a Gln surrogate [30] and a cyclohexyl methyl residue at the P 1 and P 2 positions, respectively, capable of engaging in H-bonding and hydrophobic interactions. Finally, based on the recently-demonstrated in vivo efficacy of aldehyde bisulfite adducts [31] , this moiety was incorporated into inhibitor (I) and, for comparative purposes, the corresponding aldehyde inhibitors were also included.\n\nThe synthesis of inhibitors 6a-7m was accomplished using the reaction sequence shown in Scheme 1. Briefly, N-Boc-L-cyclohexyl methyl alanine was coupled to glutamine surrogate 8 [30] to obtain 2, followed by removal of the Boc protective group to yield intermediate 3 which was subsequently reacted with a series of sulfonyl chlorides to yield sulfonamide esters 4a-m. Reduction with lithium borohydride generated the corresponding alcohols 5a-m. Dess-Martin periodinane oxidation of 5a-m proceeded smoothly to yield aldehydes 6a-m which were transformed to the corresponding aldehyde bisulfite adducts 7a-m. The synthesized sulfonamide derivatives are listed in Table 1 . Carbamates 12a-c were synthesized according to Scheme 2 via reaction of intermediate 3 with an appropriate chloroformate and further elaboration to yield the corresponding aldehydes and aldehyde bisulfite adducts, which are listed in Table 2 .\n\nThe inhibitory activity of the synthesized compounds against NV 3CLpro and their anti-norovirus activity in a cell-based replicon system, were evaluated as described in the experimental section [32] . The determined IC 50 , EC 50 and CC 50 values are listed in Tables 1 and 2 and they are the average of at least two determinations.\n\nInspection of the results in Table 1 permit the following inferences to be drawn:\n\n(a) the potency of the aldehyde bisulfite adducts is comparable to those of the precursor aldehydes, an observation noted previously [25, 33] . Advantages accrued through the use of aldehyde bisulfite adducts include higher solubility and metabolic stability, as well as low cytotoxicity [31] . Whether the bisulfite adducts exert their action by functioning as transition state mimics or latent precursors of the aldehyde functionality, or both, has not been established as yet and is currently under investigation; (b) a significant increase in potency (15-fold) was observed when the phenyl ring is moved further into the S 4 pocket ( Table 1 , compare the EC 50 values of compounds 7a, 7b and 7c) and an additional 4-fold gain in potency was realized by extending the linker further (Table 1 , Figure 6 ). Inhibitor 7m adopts a binding mode in the active site similar to 7l ( Figure 7 ) which is clearly evident from the superposition of the two inhibitors in the active site of the enzyme ( Figure 8 ). Furthermore, inhibitor 7m engages in identical H-bond interactions as inhibitor 7l (Figure 9 ), hence the comparable potencies. Importantly, the n-octyl chain encompasses the S 4 subsite and participates in hydrophobic interactions with the string of hydrophobic amino acids that make up the S 4 pocket ( Figure 10 ). The importance of hydrophobic interactions is similarly evident in carbamate derivatives 11c/12c (Table 2) ; and, (f) an eight to ten-fold increase in potency was realized when the sulfonamide linkage was replaced by a carbamate moiety ( Table 2 , compounds 11a/12a versus compounds 6h/7h in Table 1 ).
