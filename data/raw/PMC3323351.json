{"title": "Collecting Data To Assess SARS Interventions", "body": "Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the minimum epidemiologic variables needed to evaluate the public health effect of SARS and the cost of interventions. These data would provide the evidence to determine key epidemiologic relationships, including the incubation period (time from exposure to onset of symptoms), the onset of symptoms leading to hospitalization, and the outcomes resulting from treatment (either discharge of patient or death). Descriptions of the variables listed in Figures 1 and 2, along with suggestions for coding, are provided in Tables A1 and A2. For all tables, the column heading corresponds with the variable name (e.g., A represents the case identification [ID] number, B represents sex, C represents age).\n\nFigure 1 captures case-patient demographics, exposures, and symptoms. Suggested coding for demographic variables (Tables A1 and A2) include patient ID and age as continuous variables and sex and coexisting conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes) or syndromes (HIV/AIDS) as categorical variables. Other categories for coexisting conditions can be added as appropriate (e.g., smoking). An important distinction should be made between patients who have no known diagnosed coexisting conditions (coded as none known) as opposed to patients for whom information about coexisting conditions is not available or missing (coded as unknown).\n\nIn Figure 1, exposure variables and their suggested coding include date (DD/MM/YY), source (whether the source is already identified and included in the data table as an observed patient with an assigned ID or whether the source is unknown), duration of exposure (<30 minutes, 30\u201359 minutes, or >60 minutes), and locale (whether exposure occurred at home, in a hospital, or some other location). The same variables are measured for each exposure, and the table can be expanded to collect information on all known exposures.\n\nSymptoms are categorized as either respiratory or nonrespiratory. For each symptom, onset date and type (a categorical variable that can be expanded for patients with multiple symptoms) are collected. Suggested categories for symptoms include fever, myalgia, dyspnea, headache, chills, diarrhea, nausea, sore throat, arthralgia, chest pain, productive cough, nonheadache neurologic symptoms (e.g., dizziness), rhinorrhea or runny nose, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The list of symptom categories can be revised or extended as needed.\n\nFigure 2 contains information on case criteria, along with health outcomes associated with the case. Categorical variables making up case status include the clinical case criteria (either asymptomatic or mild respiratory illness, moderate illness, severe respiratory illness, or none), epidemiologic criteria (travel within 10 days to infected area, close contact, both, or none), laboratory confirmation (yes, no, or undetermined), and case classification (probable, suspected, or noncase).\n\nOutcome variables include hospitalization (along with admission date if hospitalized), treatment status (antiviral agent, antibacterial agent, or other treatment), isolation start date, number of days isolated (a continuous variable), number of days on ventilation or in intensive care (continuous variables), discharge date (0 if still hospitalized), death (yes or no), and date of death. Appendix provides an example of Figures 1 and 2 filled out with data from four \"typical\" case-patients. The variable categories from Table A1 can be readily extended or revised as new information about SARS becomes available. The footnotes offer the definitions that served as the basis for the suggested categories.\n\nTables A1 and A2 also provide proposed priority classification groups for each variable listed in Figures 1 and 2. Variables that are labeled \"priority group 1\" represent the most important set of variables, and those labeled as \"priority group 3,\" the least important. The Table provides a summary of how each variable contributes to important health policy questions related to the SARS outbreak. Taken together, these tables can provide guidance to health organizations regarding which data should be collected so that the needed policy analysis can be conducted.\n\nPriority group 1 variables (sex, age, date and source of exposure, date of symptom onset, and case status and criteria variables) contain the information on the transmission rate of the disease and incubation periods. These variables provide crucial information in determining the basic reproduction number of an infection (defined as the expected number of secondary infectious cases resulting from one primary case in a susceptible population) (4,5). This measure is vital for estimating the impact of control measures to reduce the transmission of SARS (4,5). Priority group 2 variables (duration and locale of exposure; hospitalization, including start date; isolation, including start date; and death, including date of death) provide information that can be used to evaluate the risk for hospitalization or death associated with exposure, length of incubation, and impact of isolation. Priority group 3 variables (coexisting conditions; categories of symptoms; treatment status; ventilation or intensive care, including start date; and date of discharge) are not essential information for containing SARS outbreaks but provide additional information about healthcare resources (treatment and intensive care) used to treat SARS patients. Priority group 3 variables can also be used by hospital administrators and public health officials to plan and prepare for a sudden change in resource use during a catastrophic infectious disease outbreak (e.g., pandemic influenza) (6).\n\nThe emergence of a novel disease like SARS, which requires a global public health response to contain its spread, has illustrated the need for collecting effectiveness data in a uniform manner. Given the potential for a large variation in location-specific circumstances, producing a single questionnaire that would be entirely suitable for all locales would be difficult. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate some of the most important data needed to understand and control the disease. The tables present a standardized protocol and approach for ensuring that all the proposed data have been collected. As an illustration of the use of the tables, a case study is presented in Tables A3 and A4. Identifying effective interventions during an outbreak becomes important in managing public health resources. The minimum dataset proposed here provides a basis for standardizing the collection of data from various geographic locations, thereby facilitating the analysis of SARS interventions.\n\nA 55-year-old man traveled to mainland China from March 5 to March 15. By March 18, the man had a temperature of 38.5\u00b0C, cough, and sore throat. He was hospitalized on March 20, and results from radiographic tests indicated pneumonia. The patient was given a course of antimicrobial drugs, and the fever resolved. By March 23, the patient began complaining of chest pains and had difficulty breathing. At this point, SARS was suspected, and the patient was moved into isolation in an intensive care unit the same day and had to be intubated for 5 days. Results from the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test indicated the presence of the SARS-associated coronavirus. The patient began antiviral treatment and remained isolated in intensive care until April 14. Infection resolved, and the patient was discharged on April 16. The patient had no previous history of serious respiratory illness or any other serious coexisting conditions, and the source of the exposure could not be determined.\n\nThe 50-year-old wife of patient 1 was exposed to SARS upon her husband's return on March 15. On March 23, a cough developed, and she had shortness of breath and chills. She was hospitalized on March 24 with a temperature of 38.1\u00b0C. Radiographic tests indicated evidence of pneumonia. Because SARS was suspected, the patient was placed on antiviral treatment, and SARS was confirmed by PCR testing. Patient 2 was placed in isolation on a medical ward on March 25 and remained there until April 11. She was discharged on April 12. This patient was also diabetic.\n\nThe 15-year-old daughter of patients 1 and 2 also became exposed to SARS when her father returned on March 15. She has a mild asthma condition. On March 23, she complained of stomach pain and, upon examination, had a temperature of 37.7\u00b0C. She was hospitalized on March 25 for observation, but no further symptoms developed. PCR testing returned negative results for the SARS coronavirus. Her fever resolved, and she was released on March 27.\n\nThe 23-year-old daughter of patients 1 and 2, who lived away the family home, became exposed to SARS through contact with both patients 1 and 2 upon a brief visit (lasting <1 hour) on March 19. By March 27, she had a cough and a temperature of 38.1\u00b0C. She contacted her physician and was hospitalized on March 28 for observation and evaluation. Results of radiographic testing did not show pneumonia. She began an antiviral treatment program and began to improve. A PCR test was not completed because her fever resolved, and no other symptoms developed. She was discharged on April 1."}
