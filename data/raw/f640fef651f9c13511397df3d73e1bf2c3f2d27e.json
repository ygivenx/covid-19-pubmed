{"title": "Synthesis and anti-HSV activity of tricyclic penciclovir and hydroxybutylguanine derivatives", "body": "The herpes simplex virus (HSV), like all herpes viruses, establishes lifelong latency following a primary infection. HSV-associated diseases can range from mild orolabial ulcers (cold sores) to severe encephalitis. 1 Herpes simplex viruses are categorised into two types: HSV-1, which is mainly transmitted through oral-oral contact resulting mainly in cold sores; 1 and HSV-2, which is mainly sexually transmitted resulting in the most common infection of genital herpes. 2 Globally two thirds of the population under the age of 50 are estimated to be infected with HSV-1. 3 Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is the most common cause of sporadic fatal viral encephalitis, accounting for almost 20% of all cases of encephalitis. 4 HSE presents as an acute focal necrotising infection of the brain, which, if untreated, has a 70% mortality rate. 5 The first line treatment of HSE is aciclovir (ACV), administered intravenously for 14-21 days, however even when treated, HSE is associated with a 30% mortality rate and permanent neurological damage. [6] [7] [8] Limitations of ACV therapy for HSE are the development of viral resistance 9 and low CNS uptake. 10 Tricyclic ACV and ganciclovir (GCV) derivatives ( Fig. 1 ) were shown to be effective inhibitors of HSV-1 thymidine kinase (TK) and are of interest as they maintain the inhibitory activity against the enzyme and, as they are more lipophilic than the current medications, may be valuable agents for the treatment of CNS infections. [11] [12] [13] Moreover, these tricyclic compounds were found to exhibit strong intrinsic fluorescent properties, which allows for sensitive concentration monitoring and optimal therapeutic dosing. [11] [12] [13] Penciclovir (PCV) and hydroxybutylguanine (HBG) (Fig. 1) are the carbocyclic analogues of GCV and ACV, respectively. The spectrum of activity of PCV against human herpesviruses was found to be similar to that of ACV, however in certain circumstances PCV was more active than ACV owing to the higher stability of PCV-TP in infected cells relative to ACV-TP. 14 Also, at concentrations up to 100 \u00b5g/mL, it was confirmed that PCV, like ACV, was highly selective and subsequently did not exhibit any toxicity in cell culture. 14 Similarly, HBG is reported to have higher affinity for HSV-1 TK than ACV in addition to relatively comparable selectivity for inhibition of viral DNA synthesis and good safety profile in cell https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2019.02.005 Received 11 December 2018 ; Received in revised form 18 January 2019; Accepted 1 February 2019 culture. 15 Application of the tricyclic scaffold modification to PCV and HBG was of interest to determine whether antiviral activity was maintained and, importantly, modification of the nucleobase moiety with an additional ring may result in beneficial physicochemical properties (enhanced lipophilicity, fluorescence) and/or enhanced enzyme binding interaction. A library of tricyclic PCV and HBG derivatives (Fig. 2 ) was designed and synthesised to evaluate antiviral activity and study structure-activity relationships, supported by computational docking analysis.\n\nPCV (6) and HBG (7) were prepared as previously described by reaction of 2-amino-6-chloropurine (1) with 5-(2-bromoethyl)-2phenyl-1,3-dioxane (2) 16 or 4-bromobutylacetate (3) 17 with subsequent acid hydrolysis of the protected derivatives (4) and (5) (Scheme 1).\n\nThe new tricyclic analogues of PCV and HBG, 3-[4-hydroxy-3-(hydroxymethyl)butyl]-6-(aryl)-3,5 dihydro-9H-imidazo[1,2-a]purin-9-one (9) and 3-(4-hydroxybutyl)-6-(aryl)-3,5-dihydro-9H-imidazo[1,2-a] purin-9-one (10) were obtained upon reaction of the sodium salt of PCV (6) and HBG (7), generated in situ on treatment with NaH, and the appropriate bromoketone (8) in 38-79% yield (Table 1) . The new compounds were purified by flash column chromatography using a gradient eluting mixture of CH 2 Cl 2 -MeOH followed by recrystallisation (Scheme 1). The procedure used for the preparation of the new derivatives mostly followed a previously reported method for the preparation of analogously modified guanosine and other tricyclic derivatives. 12 The tricyclic derivatives showed some sensitivity towards light and air, so were protected by wrapping with foil and rapid storage in amber coloured vials. The 6-thien-2-yl group was highly unstable to light and air and in the case of the PCV derivative decomposed rapidly during collection. Conversely, its HBG congener (10h) was stable enough to be collected safely.\n\nThe tricyclic compounds (9 and 10) were screened as inhibitors of HSV using herpes simplex virus-1 (KOS strain), herpes simplex virus-2 (G strain), thymidine kinase deficient (aciclovir resistant) herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1 TK-KOS ACV r strain) in human embryonic lung (HEL) cells. None of the tricyclic HBG derivatives (10) showed any inhibitory activity (EC 50 > 100 \u03bcM) or cytotoxicity (> 100 \u03bcM) against HSV-1 or HSV-2. However, some of the tricyclic PCV derivatives (9) exhibited anti-herpetic activity ( Table 2) .\n\nOf the newly synthesised tricyclic PCV derivatives, compounds 9a, 9c, 9d and 9j were inactive as antiviral agents. Compounds 9h and 9i showed anti-HSV-1 activity only at a relatively high concentration (EC 50 = 76.5 and 44.7 \u00b5M, respectively), compounds 9b and 9e showed moderate anti-HSV-1 activity (EC 50 = 8.9 and 20.00 \u00b5M/mL, respectively), whereas 9g and 9f were the most active and were inhibitory to HSV-1 replication with EC 50 = 1.5 and 7.6 \u00b5M, respectively. Similar to anti-HSV-1 results, among the synthesised tricyclic PCV compounds, compounds 9g and 9f were the most active against the HSV-2 strain and showed marked inhibition (EC 50 = 0.8 and 2.3 \u00b5M, respectively). Also, compounds 9b, 9e and 9i showed moderate activity against HSV-2 strain (EC 50 = 28-40.9 \u00b5M), whereas the remaining compounds did not show any activity against the HSV-2 strain. Two compounds, 9b and 9g, retained activity against the TK \u2212 ACV resistant strain of HSV-1.\n\nTricyclic derivative Compound 9g showed potent inhibitory activity against HSV-1 TK \u2212 (EC 50 = 0.8 \u00b5M), whereas compound 9b was moderately active against HSV-1 TK \u2212 (EC 50 = 12 \u00b5M). The data suggest that in the case of the resistant strain TK \u2212 , compounds 9f and 9g are independent of viral TK catalysed phosphorylation for antiviral activity and/or may use a different metabolic activation pathway and/or display a unique mechanism of antiviral action by the un-metabolised nucleoside analogue.\n\nIn addition to HSV all the tricyclic derivatives (9 and 10) were screening against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses including vaccinia virus, adenovirus-2, human coronavirus (229E), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (AD-169 strain and Davis strain), varicella-zoster virus (TK + VZV OKA strain and TK \u2212 VZV 07-1 strain), vesicular stomatitis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza-3 virus, reovirus-1, Sindbis virus, Punta Toro virus, yellow fever virus, influenza A virus (H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 subtypes) and influenza B virus. Of all the compounds, only a few displayed any inhibitory activity < 100 \u03bcM against VZV and HCMV (Table 3) : 9e (R = CF 3 -C 6 H 4 -) showed weak inhibitory activity against cytomegalovirus AD-169 strain and Davis strain (EC 50 = 63.1 \u00b5M and 76.5 \u00b5M respectively) compared with GCV as the reference compound (EC 50 = 6.5 \u00b5M and 4.6 \u00b5M respectively) and the TK + VZV Oka strain (EC 50 = 49.5 \u00b5M); 9f (R = HO-C 6 H 4 -) showed inhibitory activity against varicella-zoster virus TK + VZV OKA strain and TK \u2212 VZV 07-1 strain (EC 50 = 9.6 \u00b5M and \u2265 74.5 \u00b5M respectively) compared with ACV as the reference compound (EC 50 = 5.0 \u00b5M and 59.2 \u00b5M respectively); 9d and 9j only displayed minimal activity against the VZV TK + strain Oka (EC 50 = 63 \u00b5M). It should be noted that in contrast to HSV, HBG (7) proved inactive against HCMV and poorly inhibited the VZV TK + strain (EC 50 = 76.5 \u00b5M). PCV was not inhibitory to HCMV but inhibited VZV with EC 50 values comparable with those of ACV, i.e. 3.5 and 33.4 \u00b5M, respectively for TK + and TK-VZV strains (Table 3 ).\n\nThe new compounds were screened for their potential cytostatic activity against eight human cancer cell lines. The 50% cytostatic inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) causing a 50% decrease in cell proliferation was determined against retina (non-cancerous) hTERT RPE-1, pancreatic adenocarcinoma Capan-1, chronic myeloid leukaemia Hap1, lung carcinoma NCI-H460, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia DND-41, acute myeloid leukaemia HL-60, chronic myeloid leukaemia K-562 and non-Hodgkin lymphoma Z-138 (Table 4) .\n\nAmong the tricyclic PCV derivatives compounds 9e (R = CF 3 -C 6 H 4 -) and 9j (R = C 6 H 5 -O-C 6 H 4 -) showed moderate cytostatic activity against at least six cell lines in the range of 12.5-76.1 \u00b5M and 16.9-90.4 \u00b5M respectively. The tricyclic HBG derivatives (10) were generally inactive or displayed very weak cytostatic activity. Of the tricyclic HBG Scheme 1.

ND: not determined.\n\nderivatives the trifluoromethyl aryl derivative of HBG 10e (R = CF 3 -C 6 H 4 -) was the most effective against the range of cancer cell lines. Proliferation of the pancreatic adenocarcinoma Capan-1 cell line was slightly inhibited by most of the new tricyclic compounds as well as the parent compounds PCV and HBG (Table 4 ).\n\nMolecular modelling of the compounds was performed using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software 18 and the crystal structure of HSV-1 thymidine kinase co-crystallised with PCV (PDB 1KI3) 19 and 9-(4-hydroxybutyl)-N2-phenylguanine (HBPG) (PDB 1QHI). 20 The crystal structures of HSV-1 TK do not include an ATP molecule and a sulphate ion is observed at the supposed position of the \u03b2-phosphate of ATP. 19,20 Therefore, the distance between OH of the acyclic chain and SO 4 was measured to give an idea about the proper orientation of the ligand within the active site and the possibility for the compound acyclic OH to be phosphorylated by the enzyme. Results indicated that PCV analogues 9a-j display distances in the range of 2.73-6.82 \u00c5 compared with PCV (4.61 \u00c5). The HSV-1 TK pocket is predominately lipophilic with several regions of hydrophilicity. PCV and HBPG probe the space of the enzyme active site in a manner that maintains both the base moiety (guanine) and the acyclic sugar hydroxyl groups in a good geometry.\n\nOverall docking results revealed some important interactions for the binding of the reference ligands PCV and HBPG within the active site (Fig. 3) . The base moiety is lying in a location that stacks with Tyr172 and makes hydrophobic interactions with the amino acid residues; Tyr172, Met128, His58. Also, H-bond interactions are observed between the carbonyl group as well as the top ring nitrogens with Arg176 and Gln125. The acyclic sugar moiety forms two important H-bond interactions with amino acid residues Arg163 and Glu83 (Fig. 3) .\n\nThe tricyclic PCV compounds lead to interactions with additional amino acids and, amongst the new compounds, the observed interactions of the most active compounds 9f and 9g (R = 4-HO-C 6 H 4 , and 4-MeO-C 6 H 4 ) closely mimic the interactions observed with PCV binding. However, rather than Gln125, the 4-HO-C 6 H 4 and 4-MeO-C 6 H 4 form a H-bond interaction with Ala168 or water-bridged H-bonds with Ala168 and Gln125 (Fig. 4) . The moderately active fluoro substituted analogues, 9b and 9e, showed almost similar binding modes, although the small fluoro substituent was better docked within the base pocket with the tricyclic moiety forming \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction with Tyr172. As the tricyclic purine moiety is longer than the guanine base of PCV, the orientation of the 6-arylgroup has an impact on the geometry of the acyclic hydroxyl groups and hence the stability of the formed complex for further phosphorylation. PCV analogues 9h, 9i and 9j with relatively more bulky ether moieties (4-EtO-C 6 H 4 , 3-OCH 2 O-4-C 6 H 3 and 4-C 6 H 5 O-C 6 H 4 ) formed weak interactions within the acyclic sugar binding pocket. In addition a steric clash was observed in the case of compound 9j. The steric effect might consequently diminish or abolish their complex stability. Analysis of the docked HBG analogues 10a-h compared with HBPG suggests that the ligand likely competes between two different binding orientations within the active site. In one orientation the tricyclic base moiety stacks with Tyr172 with the carbonyl group forming a H-bond with Gln125, while the acyclic hydroxyl group is situated 5.73-7.13 \u00c5 from the sulphate group (HPBG 5.66 \u00c5) and donates a H-bond to Glu83 and/or accepts water bridged H-bonds from Arg163, Glu83, Arg222 and Lys62. Also, Arg176, in some derivatives, donates a H-bond to N-1 (Fig. 5A ). In the other orientation the tricyclic structure is lying in a location that allows a stacking interaction with His58 and the carbonyl group is being upturned to accept a H-bond from Arg163 and/or waterbridged H-bonds from Arg163, Glu83, Arg222 and Lys62. In contrast, the same acyclic hydroxyl group in the second ligand orientation is 12.75 \u00c5 away from the sulphate compared with the former orientation where it accepts a H-bond from Arg176 (Fig. 5B ). In both orientations no contribution in ligand binding was observed for the 6-aryl group resulting in more flexibility and weaker binding of the whole compound within the active site.\n\nComparing antiviral activity to compound structure provides an insight into which functional groups may be beneficial towards HSV-1 inhibitory activity.\n\nThe SAR study suggested that a di-hydroxyl acyclic sugar moiety was essential for the activity. For the PCV derivatives, activity was only retained in those that have a hydrogen bond forming group on the tricyclic ring, however the size of the hydrogen bond forming group is limited with larger groups inducing a steric effect that exhibits an apparent impact on activity, which was supported by molecular docking (Fig. 6) .\n\nThe new tricyclic analogues of PCV and HBG are the carbocyclic analogues of the previously reported tricyclic analogues of GCV and ACV, 11, 12 (Fig. 1) . For both the tricyclic ACV and GCV derivatives, inhibitory activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 were generally comparable, however this activity was not retained in HSV-1 TK -KOS ACV r strain. Replacing oxygen in the acyclic chain of the tricyclic ACV analogues by carbon in the new tricyclic HBG derivatives abolished their activity, highlighting the preference of O rather than CH 2 in the acyclic chain of the tricyclic guanine derivative. In the case of the tricyclic PCV derivatives the activity generally decreased noticeably however activity was retained only in the tricyclic PCV derivatives with R = 6-(4-MeO-C 6 H 4 ) and R = 6-(4-HO-C 6 H 4 ) and R = 6-(4-F-C 6 H 4 ) groups as discussed in the present study. Importantly, for two of the tricyclic PCV derivatives with R = 6-(4-MeO-C 6 H 4 ) and R = 6-(4-F-C 6 H 4 ) groups activity was retained in the ACV resistant HSV-1 TK -KOS strain, which was not observed for the tricyclic GCV compounds. 11, 12 This preliminary study provides useful data for further development of tricyclic acyclic nucleoside derivatives with improved lipophilicity and retention of activity in TK deficient strains.\n\nAll reagents and solvents were of general purpose or analytical grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Ltd, Fisher Scientific, Fluka and Acros. 1 H, 13 C and 19 F NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Avance DPX500 spectrometer operating at 500, 125 and 470 MHz respectively, with Me 4 Si as internal standard. Elemental analysis was performed (for compounds 10e and 10g) by MEDAC Ltd (Chobham, Surrey, UK). High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were determined (for compounds 9a-j, 10a-d, 10f, and 10h) at the EPSRC National Mass Spectrometry Facility at Swansea University and Medac Ltd (Chobham, Surrey, UK), using ESI (Electrospray Ionisation). Flash column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh) (Merck) and TLC was carried out on precoated silica plates (kiesel gel 60 F 254 , BDH). Compounds were visualised by illumination under UV light (254 nm). Melting points were determined on an electrothermal instrument and are uncorrected. All solvents were dried prior to use and stored over 4 \u00c5 molecular sieves, under nitrogen. All the compounds were \u226595% pure.\n\nThe following compounds were prepared as previously described: PCV (6), 16 HBG (7), 17 To a suspension of penciclovir (6) or hydroxybutylguanine (7) (0.2 g, 0.8 mmol or 0.9 mmol, respectively) in dry dimethylformamide (16 mL), sodium hydride (60% suspension in mineral oil, 1.2 eq.) was added and the reaction stirred at room temperature (21\u00b0C) for 1.5 h. Bromoketone (8) (1.3 eq.) was then added and the reaction stirred for 6 h. Aqueous ammonia (25% solution 5 mL) was added to quench the reaction, which was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residual oil purified by flash column chromatography using gradient elution (CH 2 Cl 2 -MeOH). The obtained products were recrystallised from a mixture of CH 2 Cl 2 and MeOH. 13 13 \n\nThe antiviral assays were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in HEL [herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) (KOS), HSV-2 (G), vacc\u00ednia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, cytomegalovirus (HCMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), adenovirus-2, and human corona virus (299E)], Vero (para-influenza-3, reovirus-1, Sindbisvirus, and Coxsackie B4), HeLa (vesicular stomatitis virus, Coxsackie virus B4, and respiratorysyncytial virus), or MDCK [influenza A (H1N1; H3N2) and influenza B] cell cultures. Confluent cell cultures (or nearly confluent for MDCK cells) in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque-forming units (PFU). After 1-2 h virus adsorption period, residual virus was removed, and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations (200, 40, 8, 1.6, 0.32 \u03bcM) of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 (50% effective concentration) or compound concentration required to reduce virusinduced cytopathogenicity or viral plaque formation by 50%. The MCC (minimal cytotoxic concentration) values were determined as the compound concentration required to afford a microscopically visible alteration of cell morphology. The new compounds were screened for their potential cytostatic activity against eight human cancer cell lines. The 50% cytostatic inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) causing a 50% decrease in cell proliferationrelative to the number of cells in the untreated controls was determined against retina (non cancerous) hTERT RPE-1, pancreatic adenocarcinomaCapan-1, chronic myeloid leukaemia Hap1, lung carcinoma NCI-H460, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia DND-41, acute myeloid leukaemia HL-60, chronic myeloid leukaemia K-562 and non-Hodgkin lymphoma Z-138.\n\nDocking studies were performed using the MOE 18 crystal structure of HSV-1 thymidine kinase co-crystallised with PCV (PDB 1KI3) 19 and 9-(4-hydroxybutyl)-N2-phenylguanine (HBPG) (PDB 1QHI). 20 All minimisations were performed with MOE until a RMSD gradient of 0.01 Kcal/mol/A with the MMFF94 forcefield and partial charges were automatically calculated. The Alpha Triangle placement, which derives poses by random superposition of ligand atom triplets through alpha sphere dummies in the receptor site, was chosen to determine the poses. The London \u0394G scoring function estimates the free energy of binding of the ligand from a given pose. Refinement of the results was done using the MMFF94 forcefield, and rescoring of the refined results using the London \u0394G scoring function was applied. The output database dock file was created with different poses for each ligand and arranged according to the final score function (S), which is the score of the last stage that was not set to zero."}
