{"title": "Requirement of CRTC1 coactivator for hepatitis B virus transcription", "body": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV), a member in the family of Hepadnaviridae, has a DNA genome 3.2 kb in size which is partially double stranded. Over 350 million people are chronically infected with HBV worldwide, including \u223c10% of the population in Hong Kong and China, 15\u201340% of whom will terminally develop severe liver diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (1). Although multiple factors are involved in the development of HCC in HBV carriers, high level of HBV DNA has been identified as a major risk (2).\n\nHBV infects hepatocytes that express its receptor named sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (3). Upon viral entry and release of genetic material, covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is generated from relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) and complexed with different viral proteins, histones, transcription factors and coactivators to form a nuclear minichromosome, which serves as a central template for all HBV transcription (4,5). Transcription of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) from cccDNA is rate-limiting in genome amplification and replication. cccDNA can be amplified through an unknown mechanism (6). The stability of the cccDNA pool is a major determinant in viral clearance. cccDNA is refractory to antivirals such as nucleoside or nucleotide analogs. cccDNA is also accounted for viral relapse after cessation of anti-HBV therapy (5). cccDNA is therefore an important target for better control and elimination of HBV infection (7,8). In line with this, understanding the mechanism by which HBV transcription from cccDNA is regulated might reveal new strategies for therapeutic intervention.\n\nHBV transcription is mediated by transcription factors recruited to cccDNA including CREB, ATF1, STAT1 and KLF15 (4,9). CREB is essential for HBV replication and it binds to the cAMP response elements (CREs) located at the X and preS2 promoters of the viral genome (10,11). Transcriptional coactivators such as p300, pCAF and CREB binding protein (CBP) are also known to be recruited to cccDNA to support HBV transcription through acetylation of histones and transcription factors (12). In addition, CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivator 2 (CRTC2) is also thought to potentiate HBV transcription through the induction of PGC1\u03b1 (13). However, the roles of additional CRTC transcriptional coactivators in relation to the function of CREB in HBV transcription have not been characterized.\n\nCRTCs are potent coactivators of CREB-dependent transcription from both canonical cellular CREs and the non-canonical viral CREs found in the long terminal repeats of the oncogenic retrovirus human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (14,15). There are three isoforms of human CRTCs, namely CRTC1, CRTC2 and CRTC3. They interact with CREB and cooperate with p300/CBP to potentiate CREB-dependent transcription (15). Because various signals converge on CRTCs to exert their effects on the transcription of CREB-regulated genes, they are the targets of pharmaceutical agents such as metformin, a widely prescribed drug for type II diabetes (16). Thus, full characterization of the roles of CRTCs in HBV transcription might reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention.\n\nHBV encodes a multifunctional viral oncoprotein HBx. It acts as a transcriptional activator that modestly activates cellular transcription factors including CREB, NF-\u03baB and AP1 (17). HBx is required for HBV transcription and productive infection in vivo (18,19). HBx does not bind DNA. Its ability to activate HBV promoters is mediated through CREB (10,20). Mechanistically, HBx enhances CREB dimerization and potentiates coactivator function of p300/CBP (20,21). However, the interplay among HBx, CREB and CRTCs in HBV transcription remains to be understood. Particularly, it will be of interest to see whether and how HBx interacts with and modulates CRTC activity.\n\nIn this study, we documented the requirement of CRTC1 in HBV transcription. CRTC1 protein was more abundantly detected in liver tissues of HBV-infected individuals. The HBV-induced stabilization of CRTC1 protein was further validated. We provided the first evidence that CRTC1 and its homologs CRTC2 and CRTC3 cooperate with HBx to activate HBV transcription through CREB. Our work suggests a new model in which HBV, through mutual stabilization of HBx and CRTC1, usurps CRTC1 transcriptional coactivator to augment CREB-mediated activation of HBV transcription.\n\nSampling of human liver tissues was performed as previously described (22). Seven Chinese patients who had surgical resection of liver at Queen Mary Hospital of Hong Kong were randomly selected for study. All specimens were obtained immediately after surgical resection, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221270\u00b0C. Frozen sections were cut from non-tumorous liver and histological examination was performed to verify homogeneous cell populations of tissues. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was detected in the sera of patients 127, 128, 216 and 229, but not patients 210, 213 and 223. HBV DNA status in liver samples was also verified. The use of human liver tissues was approved by the Joint Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong and Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster.\n\nHepG2.2.15 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 380 \u03bcg/ml G418. Plasmid DNA was transfected into HepG2 cells using GeneJuice transfection reagent (Novagen). siRNA was transfected into HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).\n\nReporter plasmids preS2-Luc, X-Luc, preS1-Luc and C-Luc were derived from pGL3-Basic (Promega). preS1 (nucleotides 2710\u20132834), preS2 (nucleotides 2966\u2013152), X (nucleotides 950\u20131310) and C (nucleotides 1403\u20131817) promoter sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the HBV genome of adw2 subtype (Genbank AM282986) in plasmid pHBV1.3D, which has been described elsewhere (9,23). Expression plasmids for CREB, A-CREB, CRTC1, CRTC2, CRTC3, CRTC1-S167A and CRTC1-M1, as well as reporter plasmid pCRE-Luc have also been detailed previously (15,24). The expression plasmid for HBx was based on the pCAGEN vector and the HBx open reading frame (nucleotides 1374\u20131838) was PCR amplified from pHBV1.3D with the addition of a Flag-HA tag to its 5\u2032 end. The X-deficient pHBV1.3D was made by converting the eighth codon of HBx to a stop codon. The mutagenic primers were 5\u2032-CGCGAAGGAT CCAGTTAGCA GTACAACCTA GCA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCGCTTCCTA GGTCAATCGT CATGTTGGAT CGT-3\u2032. A similar construct has been described elsewhere (25). Expression vector for the lysine-free (K0) mutant of ubiquitin is a kind gift from Dr James Chen (26).\n\nDual luciferase assay was performed as described previously (27,28). Transfection efficiencies were normalized to a control plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase (pSV-RLuc from Promega).\n\nCoimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed as previously described (22,29). For Co-IP, HepG2 or HepG2.2.15 cells grown in a 100-mm petri dish were harvested into 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium vanadate and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Flag-HBx, CRTC1-V5 and endogenous CREB proteins were immunoprecipitated from the cleared lysate by incubation at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. For ChIP, HepG2 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed and then lysed in the presence of protease inhibitor cocktail. The DNA\u2013protein complex was immunoprecipitated. The cross-link was reversed by proteinase K. The DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction. Promoter sequence spanning the two CRE enhancers in the preS2 promoter was analyzed by quantitative PCR using primers 5\u2032-CCCTGCTCCG AATATTGCCT C-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ACACACGGGT GATCCCCCTA G-3\u2032. For cccDNA ChIP, quantitative PCR was performed with primers 5\u2032-CTCCCCGTCT GTGCCTTCT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCCCCAAAGC CACCCAAG-3\u2032 that selectively amplify cccDNA as previously described (7,12,29).\n\nHepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells were transfected with 100 nM of siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). RNA interference (RNAi) experiments were performed as described (27,30). siRNAs were listed in Supplementary Table S1.\n\nReal-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed as described (27,30). Normalization was made to glycerialdehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA. Quantitation of target mRNA was achieved with the comparative Ct method. Relative expression level of target mRNA was calculated from 2\u2212\u0394Ct. Primers were listed in Supplementary Table S1.\n\nTo identify proteins that are specifically expressed in HBV-infected liver, we performed a pilot proteomic profiling study using human liver tissues that are infected with HBV. We noted that CRTC1, but not CRTC2 or CRTC3, was more abundantly detected in infected versus uninfected samples (data not shown). We previously showed the requirement of CRTC coactivators in transcriptional activation of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (15). We therefore sought to investigate the expression and function of CRTC1 in HBV-infected cells.\n\nTo model HBV genome replication, we used HepG2 cells transfected with pHBV1.3D, an HBV molecular clone (9,23). In addition, HepG2.2.15 cells, which constitutively produce HBV (31), were also employed. Expression of endogenous CRTC1 protein was more pronounced in pHBV1.3D-transfected HepG2 and in HepG2.2.15 cells (Figure 1A and B, lanes 2 and 3 or 2\u20134 compared to 1), whereas the steady-state levels of CREB, CRTC2 and CRTC3 remained largely unchanged. In contrast, the mRNA levels of all three CRTCs were comparable in the presence and absence of HBV (Figure 1C), indicating that the effect on CRTC1 occurs at protein but not mRNA level. To verify CRTC1 expression in natural infection of HBV, we examined a small number of HBV-positive or HBV-negative human liver tissues. CRTC1 protein expression was 6- to 18-fold more abundant in HBV-positive samples than in HBV-negative ones (Figure 1D). One plausible interpretation to these data is that CRTC1 protein is stabilized in HBV-infected cells.\n\nGiven that CRTC1 protein is abundant in HBV-infected cells, it will be of interest to assess the influence of CRTC coactivators on HBV transcription. CRTCs potentiate CREB-dependent transcription depending on the promoter context (32,33). Although CRE elements are found in preS2 and X promoters of HBV (10,11), it remains to be determined whether they are activated by CRTCs. With this in mind, we asked how CRTCs might affect transcriptional activity of these two promoters. All three CRTCs were expressed to comparable levels in HepG2 cells (Figure 2A). Whereas all three CRTCs activated preS2 promoter significantly (Figure 2B, groups 2\u20134 compared to 1), they had minimal or no influence on basal activity of X promoter in the same setting (Figure 2C). Hence, CRTCs are capable of activating HBV transcription from the preS2 promoter.\n\nCRTC2 has recently been shown to promote HBV transcription and replication through the induction of a CREB-regulated gene, PGC1\u03b1, which in turn activates the core promoter of HBV modestly (13). Consistent with this, we observed moderate activation of the preS1 and core promoter by all three CRTCs (Supplementary Figure S1A and B, groups 2\u20134 compared to 1). Because CRTCs activate CRE and preS2 promoter much more potently (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure S1C) and no CRE was found in preS1 or core promoter, our further analysis will be focused on the preS2 promoter only.\n\nTo verify the coactivator function of CRTCs on the preS2 promoter, we performed ChIP assay to assess its recruitment to the CRE elements in this promoter. Indeed, all three CRTCs were recruited to preS2-CRE in pHBV1.3D-transfected HepG2 cells (Figure 2D, groups 3\u20135 compared to 2). Since CRTCs are thought to work in concert with CREB, we further examined the recruitment of endogenous CREB to preS2-CRE. We found that the HBV-induced recruitment of CREB to preS2-CRE was more pronounced when CRTC1/2/3 was overexpressed (Figure 2E, groups 3\u20135 compared to 2), indicating that CRTCs and CREB might activate transcription from the preS2 promoter cooperatively. In line with this, all three CRTCs were also recruited to cccDNA (Figure 2F, groups 3\u20135 compared to 2). Collectively, our results supported the model in which CRTCs facilitate HBV transcription by enhancing the recruitment of CREB to the preS2 promoter.\n\nActivation of HBV transcription might accelerate other steps in viral replication. To verify this, we measured the levels of HBV pgRNA and cccDNA in pHBV1.3D-transfected HepG2 cells. Upon pHBV1.3D transfection, basal expression of pgRNA as well as nuclear and cell-free cccDNA was detected (Figure 3A and B, group 2, and Figure 3C, lane 3). Intriguingly, their expression was boosted when CRTC1/2/3 was overexpressed (Figure 3A and B, groups 3\u20135 compared to 2 and Figure 3C, lanes 4\u20136 compared to 3). In other words, overexpression of CRTCs not only stimulates HBV transcription, but also promotes its replication.\n\nTo determine the requirement of CREB in CRTC-induced activation of HBV replication, we employed A-CREB, a previously described dominant inactive form of CREB (34). The expression of A-CREB abrogated CRTC1-induced augmentation of cccDNA formation in pHBV1.3D-transfected HepG2 cells (Figure 3D, group 4 compared to 2 and 3). Consistent with this, the increase in cccDNA level in the presence of CRTC1 in HepG2.2.15 cells was blunted when A-CREB was overexpressed (Figure 3E, group 3 compared to 1 and 2). Thus, CREB is required for CRTC1-induced activation of HBV replication.\n\nComplementary to the gain-of-function analyses described above, loss-of-function experiments were also performed to establish the physiological importance of CRTC1 in HBV transcription and replication. Because only CRTC1 levels were elevated in HBV-infected cells (Figure 1), we chose to focus on CRTC1 in the loss-of-function study. We first utilized M1-CRTC1, a truncated and dominant inactive mutant of CRTC1, which we constructed and successfully used previously (24,27,30). When the dose of M1-CRTC1 was escalated in HepG2 cells, the activity of the preS2 promoter was diminished progressively (Figure 4A, groups 2\u20134 compared to 1). Moreover, the intracellular cccDNA pool decreased in M1-CRTC1-expressing HepG2 cells (Figure 4B). Accordingly, the pgRNA levels also declined in a dose-dependent manner in these cells (Figure 4C, groups 3 and 4 compared to 2).\n\nWe next employed RNAi to silence endogenous CRTC1 expression in HepG2 cells. Two independent siRNAs directed against CRTC1 (siCRTC1-a and siCRTC1-b) efficiently depleted its protein expression (Figure 4D, lanes 2 and 3 compared to 1 in the blot). The silencing effect was highly specific since only CRTC1 mRNA was affected, whereas the levels of CRTC2 transcript remained unaltered (Figure 4D, groups 3 and 5 compared to 1, and groups 4 and 6 compared to 2 in the bar chart). In keeping with this, the recruitment of endogenous CREB to preS2-CRE was prevented in CRTC1-depleted cells (Figure 4E, groups 3 and 4 compared to 2), indicating the physiological importance of CRTC1 in mobilizing CREB to the preS2 promoter to activate transcription. Furthermore, the levels of pgRNA, nuclear cccDNA and secreted HBsAg were declined when CRTC1 was compromised (Figure 4F\u2013H, groups 3 and 4 compared to 2). Collectively, our results suggest that CRTC1 is required for HBV transcription and replication.\n\nThe importance of CREB in HBV transcription prompted us to investigate whether CRTC1 activation of the preS2 promoter requires CREB function. As a first step, we generated additional reporter constructs in which the CRE elements in the preS2 promoter were disrupted. Similar constructs were previously described (10). Indeed, progressive removal of CRE elements effectively blunted CRTC1 activation of the preS2 promoter (Figure 5A, groups 5 and 6 compared to 4). Next, we asked whether functional CREB is critical in supporting CRTC1 activity by overexpressing A-CREB, a dominant inactive form of CREB (34). CRTC1 activation of the preS2 promoter was erased by A-CREB (Figure 5B, groups 3 and 4 compared to 2). Reciprocally, CREB activation of the preS2 promoter was progressively suppressed when we increased M1-CRTC1 expression in HepG2 cells (Figure 5C, groups 3 and 4 compared to 2). In line with this, the recruitment of CRTC1 to preS2-CRE was abrogated when A-CREB was overexpressed in pHBV1.3D-transfected HepG2 cells (Figure 5D, group 4 compared to 3). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments confirmed the formation of CREB\u2013CRTC1 complex in HepG2 and HepG2.2.15 cells (Supplementary Figure S2A and B). Hence, CRTC1 requires and cooperates with CREB to stimulate HBV transcription.\n\nBecause HBx also activates CREB and is required for HBV replication (10,19), we investigated the interplay among HBx, CREB and CRTC1 in HBV transcription. We observed that CRTC1 activation of both canonical CREs and the preS2 promoter was more robust when HBx was also expressed (Figure 6A and B, groups 5 and 6 compared to 4). Similar results were also obtained for CRTC2 and CRTC3 (data not shown). In addition, CRTC1 was detected in the HBx immunoprecipitate (Figure 6C, lane 3 compared to 2), indicating their association in cultured cells. Interestingly, the protein bands of both CRTC1 and HBx were more prominent when they were co-expressed (Figure 6C, lane 3 compared to 1 and 2), implicating a mutual stabilization effect. Unexpectedly, an additional slow-migrating HBx species was observed when CRTC1 was co-expressed (Figure 6C, lane 3 compared to 1). Thus, CRTC1 might direct HBx for additional protein modifications.\n\nPhosphorylation of CRTC2 at S171 was thought to trigger polyubiquitination at K628 leading to protein degradation (35). The equivalent site in CRTC1 is S167 (24). To explore whether HBx might affect the stability of CRTC1 through a similar mechanism, we compared the interaction of HBx with CRTC1 and its active non-phosphorylatable form, CRTC1-S167A. When CRTC1 and CRTC1-S167A were co-expressed with HBx in HepG2 cells, similar amounts of CRTC1 protein were found in the HBx immunoprecipitate (Supplementary Figure S3, lane 3 compared to 2). In addition, both forms of CRTC1 enhanced the recruitment of CREB to the HBx-containing complex, but to similar extent (Supplementary Figure S3, lanes 2 and 3 compared to 1). Thus, HBx has no binding preference to CRTC1-S167A. On the other hand, when we overexpressed CREB, the association of HBx and CRTC1 was not affected (Supplementary Figure S4, lane 4 compared to 3). Consistent with results in Supplementary Figure S3, both CRTC1 and CREB were found in the HBx precipitate (Supplementary Figure S4). These data were consistent with the formation of HBx\u2013CRTC1\u2013CREB triple complex.\n\nTo further investigate mutual stabilization of HBx and CRTC1, we expressed in HepG2 cells CRTC1 and its mutant CRTC1-S167A, either individually or together with HBx. Steady-state levels of both CRTC1 and its S167A mutant were increased when HBx was expressed (Figure 7A, lanes 5 and 6 compared to 2 and 3). On the other hand, HBx protein expression was more pronounced and a slow-migrating HBx species appeared when CRTC1 or CRTC1-S167A was expressed (Figure 7A, lanes 5 and 6 compared to 4). Hence, CRTC1 and HBx are mutually required for optimal stability and activity.\n\nWe next examined the impact of HBx on the steady-state levels of endogenous CRTC proteins in HepG2 cells. Notably, escalating dose of HBx expression correlated with increased levels of CRTC1 and CRTC2, but not CRTC3 (Figure 7B, lanes 2 and 3 compared to 1). On the other hand, when we overexpressed CRTCs individually, more prominent HBx bands including the slow-migrating species were visible (Figure 7C, lanes 2\u20134 compared to 1). In other words, CRTC1 and its homologs were capable of stabilizing HBx.\n\nWhen we depleted endogenous CRTC1 in HepG2.2.15 cells, expression of HBx protein was diminished (Figure 7D, lanes 2 and 3 compared to 1), suggesting a physiological role of CRTC1 in maintaining HBx protein stability. Such destabilization effect on HBx was unlikely due to an effect of CRTC1 on X promoter, which was shown to be unresponsive to CRTC1 (Figure 2B). The stabilization of CRTC1 was also seen in pHBV1.3D-transfected HepG2 cells (Figure 7E, lane 2 compared to 1). In sharp contrast, the steady-state level of CRTC1 remained unchanged (Figure 7E, lane 3 compared to 1 and 2) when HepG2 cells were transfected with pHBV1.3D-X\u2212, an X-deficient molecular clone of HBV (25). Although an X transcript was expressed from this clone at lower level (Figure 7E, lane 3 compared to 2), no functional HBx protein would be produced as shown in the literature (25). Thus, the stabilization of CRTC1 in HBV-replicating cells is HBx dependent.\n\nTo shed mechanistic light on the mutual stabilization of HBx and CRTC1, we employed proteosome inhibitor MG132 and a lysine-free (K0) mutant of ubiquitin (26). The K0 mutant of ubiquitin prevents polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation, but allows mono- and multi-ubiquitination, which might be linked to lysosome-dependent degradation (36,37). If mutual stabilization of HBx and CRTC1 is mediated solely through polyubiquitination and proteosome, their levels should be unchanged or increased in the presence of MG132 or ubiquitin-K0. Interestingly, the steady-state levels of CRTC1 and HBx decreased only slightly when the cells were treated with MG132 (Figure 7F, lane 4 compared to 3), implicating a role for proteosome in the stabilization effect. However, the expression of ubiquitin-K0 abrogated this stabilization effect almost completely (Figure 7F, lane 5 compared to 1\u20134). Although there was no simple interpretation to this result, one possibility is that mono- or multi-ubiquitination of HBx and CRTC1 might promote their proteosomal degradation. Plausibly, the stability of HBx and CRTC1 might be governed by multiple mechanisms involving ubiquitination, proteosome and lysosome.\n\nIn this study we provided the first evidence for the requirement of CRTC1 coactivator for HBV transcription and replication. Our work contributes at least three new messages concerning the role of CRTC1 in HBV infection. First, CRTC1 protein was abundantly expressed in HBV-infected cells (Figure 1). Second, CRTC1 and its homologs (CRTC2 and CRTC3) are recruited to the preS2 promoter and cccDNA to mediate transcriptional activation in cooperation with CREB (Figures 2\u20135). Finally, HBx functions to stabilize and promote CRTC1 activation of HBV transcription (Figures 6 and 7). Our findings reveal a new cellular accessory factor and a new layer of regulation in HBV gene expression.\n\nCRTC1 is particularly stabilized in HBV-infected cells (Figure 1). This stabilization effect is specific to CRTC1 (Figure 1). Although CRTC2 and CRTC3 expression was not found to be elevated in HBV-infected cells, they were also capable of occupying the preS2 promoter, stabilizing HBx and activating HBV transcription (Figures 2, 3 and 7). In other words, they are fully competent to regulate HBV gene expression. Because they might be induced and activated in response to metabolic stress and hormones (33), further studies are required to elucidate how they modulate HBV transcription under the influence of their metabolic and hormonal activators.\n\nPromoter context is a decisive factor in the requirement of CRTC coactivators for transcriptional activation of cellular CRE-dependent genes (32,33). Our demonstration of CRTC activation of the preS2 but not the X promoter of HBV (Figure 2) supports the notion that the coactivator function of CRTCs in HBV transcription is also promoter context dependent. Although the exact promoter context that governs CRTC requirement is not currently understood, a comparison of the preS2 and X promoters sheds some light on this issue. Noteworthily, there are two consecutive CREs in the preS2 promoter, both of which are required for optimal activation by CRTC1 (Figure 5). In contrast, only one single CRE has been found in the X promoter (11). Further experiments should therefore be performed to determine whether this difference in the number of CREs might be decisive in promoter responsiveness to CRTCs.\n\nOur results supported the model in which CRTCs cooperate with CREB to activate the preS2 promoter (Figure 5). We also showed the recruitment of CRTCs to cccDNA and preS2-CRE in pHBV1.3D-transfected cells (Figure 2). These findings support a more direct involvement of CRTCs in HBV transcription from cccDNA. However, an indirect stimulatory role of CRTC2 on the core promoter mediated through PGC1\u03b1 has also been suggested (13). We also observed a modest activation of the preS1 and core promoters by all three CRTCs (Supplementary Figure S1). However, since no CRE has been found in these promoters, their general and mild activation by CRTCs is likely mediated indirectly through a CREB-regulated gene such as PGC1\u03b1. Thus, the influence of CRTCs on HBV transcription might be exerted through both direct activation as demonstrated in our study and an indirect effect as suggested for CRTC2 (13). Particularly, the stimulatory effect of CRTCs on pgRNA expression (Figure 3) could be mediated through the core promoter.\n\nThe activation of the preS2 promoter by CRTC1 was mediated through CREB and CRE (Figures 2 and 5). The structural interface of CRTC2 for recognition and coactivation of CREB has been determined (38). In addition, the regulation of CRTC2 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling by upstream kinases has also been characterized (39). Plausibly, CRTC1 would use a similar interface to recognize CREB and CRTC1 activity would be regulated by the same protein kinases in the context of HBV transcription. It is noteworthy that small molecule activators and inhibitors of LKB1 and its downstream protein kinases, including metformin and salicylate, have been well documented (16,40). We have recently shown that LKB1 and its downstream kinases potently suppress transcriptional activity of CRTC1 and CREB in the context of human T-cell leukemia type 1 virus infection. In addition, the activation of these kinases using small molecule agonists such as metformin exhibits strong antiretroviral effects (27). By the same token, our characterization of the role of CRTCs in HBV life cycle will pave the way for further investigations on pharmacological inhibition of HBV transcription.\n\nHBx activates HBV and cellular gene expression through multiple mechanisms. Particularly, HBx stimulates CREB-dependent transcription by cooperating with p300/CBP coactivators (20), promoting CREB dimerization (21) and inhibiting negative regulators (41). Our documentation of the interaction and mutual stabilization of HBx and CRTC1/2 (Figures 6 and 7) provides a new mechanism by which HBx regulates HBV transcription. Since CRTCs are essential coactivators of CREB-dependent transcription of both HBV and cellular promoters, HBx might also modulate cellular CRE-dependent promoters through its interaction and stabilization of CRTC1/2.\n\nThe mutual stabilization of HBX and CRTC1/2 in HBV-infected cells (Figure 7) is attributed at least in part to their interaction (Figure 6). This stabilization unlikely occurs at the mRNA level since CRTC mRNAs remained unchanged in pHBV1.3D-transfected cells (Figure 1C) in which HBx was abundantly expressed (Figure 1B). In addition, the stabilization of HBx was seen not only when it was expressed from a plasmid in transfected HepG2 cells but also when it was expressed in HepG2.2.15 cells from its own promoter in the HBV genome (Figure 7), which is not responsive to CRTCs (Figure 2). The mechanism by which HBx and CRTC1/2 proteins mutually stabilize each other warrants further study. First, the functional domains in HBx and CRTC1/2 that mediate their interaction and stabilization should be determined. CRTC3 is more divergent from CRTC1/2 and smaller in size; comparative analysis might reveal why CRTC3 was not stabilized by HBx (Figure 7). Although CRTC2 level was elevated in HepG2 cells expressing HBx (Figure 7), it was unchanged in HepG2.2.15 or pHBV1.3D-transfected HepG2 cells (Figure 1). Further investigations are required to resolve this discrepancy and to clarify whether and how other viral proteins might affect CRTC2 protein expression. Second, the slow-migrating form of HBx detected in the presence of CRTC1/2/3 (Figure 7) should be further characterized. Particularly, whether it represented mono- or multi-ubiquitinated HBx should be clarified. Finally, exactly how stability of HBx and CRTCs in HBV-infected cells would be regulated through ubiquitination and proteolysis should be clarified. HBx has previously been shown to stabilize AIB1 oncoprotein by preventing its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation (42). In view of the minimal to mild effect of MG132 on the mutual stabilization of HBx and CRTC1 (Figure 7), a role for polyubiquitination and proteosome was suggested. However, the abrogation of the mutual stabilization effect by ubiquitin-K0 pointed to another direction. This discrepancy should be resolved in future work. The possibility that HBx and CRTC1 might be mono- or multi-ubiquitinated and then degraded by the lysosome should be experimentally validated. Alternatively, K63-linked or other types of polyubiquitination of CRTC1 suppressed by ubiquitin-K0 might be required for its stabilization. Our data cannot exclude that multiple mechanisms might operate in the control of HBx and CRTC stability. Further investigations should be performed to determine the involvement of proteosome, lysosome and different types of ubiquitination in the destruction of HBx and CRTCs in HBV-infected cells.\n\nResults from our gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays consistently supported the requirement of CRTC1 for HBV replication, as indicated in the production of pgRNA, cccDNA and secreted HBsAg (Figures 3 and 4). This is generally consistent with the notion that CRTC1-regulated HBV transcription is influential in viral replication. The decline of cccDNA level upon CRTC1 suppression (Figure 4) is noteworthy. It raises one interesting possibility that compromising CRTC1 might destabilize cccDNA. Histone hypoacetylation is known to regulate cccDNA transcription (43). APOBEC3-mediated cytidine deamination has recently been shown to trigger specific degradation of cccDNA (8). Whether and how CRTC1 recruitment to cccDNA and its post-translational modifications might affect cccDNA stability and function merit further investigations.\n\nCREB and CRTCs have oncogenic potential in various types of cancer (44,45). Our present study reveals a novel function of CRTC1 in HBV transcription and replication. The stabilization and activation of CRTC1 were observed both in HepG2 cells freshly transfected with pHBV1.3D and in HepG2.2.15 cells constitutively harboring HBV genome (Figures 2 and 6). CRTC1 might plausibly play a role in both acute and chronic phase of HBV infection. However, it will still be of importance to characterize in more detail the stabilization of CRTC1 in different phases of HBV infection and HCC development. Particularly, further investigations are required to clarify whether CRTC1 might be critical in HBV reactivation as well as initiation and progression of HCC."}
