{"title": "Polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 regulates cellular\nmetastasis-associated behavior in gastric cancer", "body": "Cancer cells frequently exhibit alterations in protein glycosylation when compared to their\nnormal counterparts and this is assumed to result from disruptions in expression levels or\nactivity of the enzymes of glycosylation, the glycosyltransferases and glycosidases (1). Aberrant glycosylation of membrane\ncomponents due to specific alterations of glycosyltransferase activity is a common feature\nof carcinoma cells and is usually associated with invasion and metastasis of cancer. For\nexample, GCNT2, which is a gene-encoding glucosaminyl (N-acetyl) transferase 2, contributes\nto breast cancer metastasis with preferential expression in basal-like breast cancer (2). ST6Gal-I expression in ovarian cancer\ncells promotes an invasive phenotype by altering integrin glycosylation and function (3). Since aberrant glycoproteins as a\nresult of these enzymes may be involved in promoting tumor invasion and metastasis, these\nenzymes could also be used as cancer biomarkers (4). Therefore, cancer-specific changes in the expression of\nglycosyltransferases exhibit the most marked and consistent change of activity in\ntumorigenesis.\n\nGastric cancer is the fourth most common malignancy and the second leading cause of\ncancer-related mortality in the world. Several reports indicate a complexity in\nglycosyltransferase activities which lead to several tumor associated carbohydrate\nstructures in gastric carcinoma. Glycosyltransferase mRNA expression has been found to be\nsignificantly altered in gastric carcinomas isolated from surgical specimens (5). Upregulation of\nglycan:sulfotransferase activities and downregulation of \u03b1,2-fucosyltransferase\nactivity appear to be associated with human gastric tumori-genesis (6). Shimizu et al(7) confirmed that \u03b14GnT, which\nforms a unique glycan, GlcNAc\u03b11-->4Gal\u03b2-->R, is detectable\nin 80% of 5 patients with an early stage of gastric cancer and the expression level\nof \u03b14GnT mRNA is increased in association with tumor progression. Recently,\n\u03b23Gn-T8, which can extend polylactosamine on N-glycan, was also reported to be\ninvolved in malignancy in gastric cancer cells (8). However, our previous study demonstrated that polypeptide\nN-acetylgal actosaminyltransferase 2 (ppGalNAc-T2) was also involved in gastric cancer\nmigration and invasion.\n\nppGalNAc-T2 is a member of the ppGalNAc-T family which catalyzes the attachment of the\nfirst N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) monosaccharide to the polypeptide at the initiation of\nO-linked glycosylation of proteins. All ppGalNAc-Ts in mammals are type II transmembrane\nproteins that have a Golgi lumenal region that contains a catalytic domain with\nglycosyltransferase activity and a C-terminal R-type lectin domain (9). The human ppGalNAc-T family contains\nmore than 18 members, each of which has unique transferase activity, different peptide\nsubstrate specificities, and dissimilar patterns of expression (10,11). Among all the ppGalNAc-Ts identified in mammals thus far, the\nppGalNAc-T2 gene was highly expressed in cancer and may play an important role in the\noccurrence and development of tumor. Brooks et al(1) reported that levels of ppGalNAc-T2\nexpression may change with the differentiation of breast carcinoma. Mandel et\nal(12) showed that\nppGalNAc-T2 expression was strong in poorly differentiated tumors. It has also been\nconfirmed that ppGalNac-T2 is involved in vanadium-induced HL-60 cell differentiation (13). Moreover, both acute T cell leukemia\nJurkat cell lines and human heptocarcinoma HepG-2 cell lines clearly express ppGalNAc-T2\n(14). The invasion and metastasis\nof human glioma cells can also be regulated by ppGalNAc-T2 (15). Our previous studies revealed that ppGalNAc-T2 expression\nappears to be higher in gastric cancer SGC7901 cells than in other poorly differentiated\nhuman cancer cells, indicating that ppGalNAc-T2 may play a vital role in the process of\ngastric cancer emergence and development. However, a comprehensive understanding of how\nppGalNAc-T2 correlates with the invasive potential of human gastric cancer is not currently\navailable.\n\nNumerous studies have shown that overexpression of Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) is\ncorrelated with the progression of gastric cancer, which contributes to tumor invasion,\nmetastasis and angiogenesis. Thus, this study was undertaken to evaluate the role of\nppGalNAc-T2 in gastric cancer invasion and metastasis by creating stable transfectants and\nevaluating them for invasive and metastatic potential in vitro. In order to\nelucidate the role of ppGalNAc-T2 in the gastric cancer metastasis process, SGC7901 cells\nwere treated with ppGalNAc-T2 sense or antisense vectors and examined for the following: i)\nthe relationship between the ppGalNAc-T2 expression and the cell proliferation, adhesion,\nand invasion ability, in order to clarify whether ppGalNAc-T2 is correlated with SGC7901\ncell metastasis-associated behavior; ii) the impact of ppGalNAc-T2 on MMP-2, MMP-14 and\ntransforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 regulation including mRNA and protein levels, to\ninvestigate the molecular mechanisms of the anti-metastasic activities in human gastric\ncarcinoma. These data suggested that high expression of the ppGalNAc-T2 gene in gastric\ncancer SGC7901 cells might exert anti-growth and anti-metastasic activity through the\ndecrease of MMP-2 and TGF-\u03b21. Our findings indicate that ppGalNAc-T2 is useful in\nregulating gastric carcinoma invasion and metastasis, and this may be used as a novel\napproach for cancer therapy.\n\nThe SGC7901 human gastric cancer, SHG44 glioma, SHI-1 leukemia, A549 lung adenocarcinoma,\nand HO8910 ovarian cancer cell lines were obtained from Shanghai Cell Bank (Shanghai,\nChina). They were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine\nserum (FBS) in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C.\nThey were selected as all these poorly differentiated cells often have aberrant terminal\nsugar structures of O-glycan chains.\n\nTransfection was carried out using Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,\nUSA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. SGC7901 cells\n(2x105) were plated onto 6-well plates until they reached\n70\u201390% confluency before transfection. Cells were transfected with 4\n\u03bcg of pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 sense vectors (SGC7901-T2s group) and\npEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 antisense vectors (SGC7901-T2as group), followed by selection with\nG418 (500 \u03bcg/ml). Individual clones were isolated and expanded for further\ncharacterization. The empty vector pEGFP-C1 was also transfected into SGC7901 cells and\nserved as the control group. Transfection efficiency was detected by fluorescence\nmicroscopy (Zeiss; Gottingen, Germany). All plasmids were constructed and conserved in our\nlaboratory (13,15).\n\nCell proliferation was measured with MTT assay. Briefly, SGC7901 cells and the stably\ntransfected clones were plated in 96-well plates at a density of cells (5x103)\nand 180 \u03bcl culture medium was added to each well. The cells were incubated at\n37\u00b0C for 24, 48, 72, 96 or 120 h, at which time the cells were incubated with 100\n\u03bcl of MTT solution (5 g/l; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 4 h. The reaction was\nstopped by the addition of l50 \u03bcl DMSO (Sigma) and the absorbance of samples at\n570 nm was then measured. A growth curve was plotted for each sample as the log cell\nnumber vs. time, and the growth rates were derived from the slope of each growth curve.\nThree independent experiments were performed and the results were used for plotting the\nrelative growth rate with SD.\n\nThe adhesion of SGC7901 cells stably transfected with sense or antisense ppGalNAc-T2\nvectors was performed using standard methods. A flat-bottomed 96-well plate was coated\novernight at 4\u00b0C with 0.2 ml Matrigel (200 \u03bcg/ml). Some wells were left\nuncoated as negative control. The plate was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline\n(PBS), blocked with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C and then\n0.5 ml suspension of tumor cells (5x103) were added. After the plate was\nincubated at 0.5, 1 and 1.5 h intervals at 37\u00b0C, unattached cells were removed by\nwashing with PBS. MTT was added to each well and the absorbance value obtained by seeding\nuncoated wells represented 100% adhesion and all other values were divided by this\nto calculate percentage adhesion.\n\nFurthermore, to investigate the adhesion of cells to various extra-cellular matrix (ECM)\ncomponents, 96-well plates were precoated with either 1 mg/ml hyaluronic acid (HA) or 50 1\ng/ml fibronectin (FN). The adhesive ability of gastric cancer cells was also detected as\ndescribed above.\n\nThe invasiveness of different SGC7901 stable cells was evaluated in 24-well Transwell\nchambers (Costar Corporation, Cambridge, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions. Briefly, Transwell chambers equipped with polycarbonate membrane (12 mm pore\nsize) were precoated with 6.25 mg/l Matrigel on the upper chamber. The cells were cultured\nin serum-free medium for 12\u201324 h. Cells (1x105) were seeded in each\ntranswell insert containing 200 \u03bcl of serum-free medium with BSA. Then 500\n\u03bcl of culture medium with 10% FBS was added into each well of a 24-well\nplate. The cells and Matrigel on the upper chamber were removed using a cotton stick after\n12 h. Cell penetration through the membrane was quantified by counting the number of cells\nthat penetrated the membrane in ten microscopic fields (at x200 magnification) per filter.\nThe experiment was repeated 3 times.\n\nTotal-RNA was isolated from equal cell numbers using Tri Reagent (Sigma) following the\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. Reverse transcription was as previously described and\n5 \u03bcl of the resultant cDNA was used as template for PCR (16). The sequences for primers with\nannealing temperatures indicated in brackets were as follows: ppGalNAc-T2,\n5\u2032-AAGAAAGACCTTCATCACAGCAATGGAGAA-3\u2032 (forward) and\n5\u2032-ATCAAAACCGCCCTTCAAGTCAGCA-3\u2032 (reverse) (60\u00b0C); MMP-2,\n5\u2032-AGATCTGCAAACAGGACA TTGTATT-3\u2032 (forward) and\n5\u2032-TTCTTCTTCACCTCATTG TATCTCC-3\u2032 (reverse) (56\u00b0C); MMP-14,\n5\u2032-TGGCGGGTGA GGAATAAC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GGGAACGCTGGCAGT\nAGAG-3\u2032 (reverse) (56\u00b0C); TGF-\u03b21, 5\u2032-TGTGGCTACTGGT\nGCTGAC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-ATAGATTTCGTTGTGGG TTTC-3\u2032 (reverse)\n(56\u00b0C); \u03b2-actin, 5\u2032-CATGTACGTTGCTA TCCAGGC-3\u2032 (forward)\nand 5\u2032-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCA CGAT-3\u2032 (reverse) (52\u00b0C). The number of\nPCR cycles used was 30 and the expected product size after primer amplification was as\nfollows: ppGalNAc-T2, 669 bp; MMP-2, 332 bp; MMP-14, 690 bp; TGF-\u03b21, 317 bp; and\n\u03b2-actin, 330 bp. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on 10 g/l\nagarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.\n\nTo detect ppGalNAc-T2, MMP-2, MMP-14 and TGF-\u03b21 protein expression in gastric\ncancer cells after the indicated treatment, cells were harvested and extracted using the\nstandard methods. Equal amounts of protein (50 \u03bcg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and\ntransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with\n5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with primary antibodies\nfor 1 h at room temperature. The proteins were analyzed using specific antibodies as\nindicated. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies and an enhanced\nchemiluminescence (ECL) kit were used for detection. Anti-human ppGalNAc-T2 monoclonal\nantibody was produced from rabbits in our laboratory (14). Anti-\u03b2-actin rabbit mAb, anti-MMP-2 rabbit mAb,\nanti-MMP-14 rabbit mAb and anti-TGF-\u03b21 rabbit mAb as well as the anti-rabbit\nsecond antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA,\nUSA).\n\nThe results shown are the mean \u00b1 SD. A P-value <0.05 was considered to\nindicate statistically significant differences. Statistical analyses were calculated using\nSPSS 11.5. Each experiment was repeated 3 times.\n\nTo investigate the potential role of ppGalNAc-T2 in human malignant tumors, we first\ndetected the expression panel of ppGalNAc-T2 in 5 types of poorly differentiated malignant\ntumor cell lines. The mRNA level of ppGalNAc-T2 in these cells was determined by RT-PCR.\nAll poorly differentiated tumor cells which have aberrant terminal sugar structures of\nO-glycan chains, including SGC7901 gastric cancer, SHG44 glioma, SHI-1 leukemia, A549 lung\nadenocarcinoma, and HO8910 ovarian cancer cells expressed ppGalNAc-T2 (Fig. 1). Thus ppGalNAc-T2 may be markers\nfor poorly differentiated carcinomas. In addition, we found that ppGalNAc-T2 mRNA was\ndifferentially expressed, as shown in Fig.\n1A. The mRNA expression ratios (ppGalNAc-T2/\u03b2-actin) were\n0.38\u00b10.016, 1.23\u00b10.017, 0.82\u00b10.035, 0.69\u00b10.014 and\n0.78\u00b10.023, respectively. The results showed that ppGalNAc-T2 expression in\nSGC7901 cells was higher than in other cells (P<0.05) (Fig. 1B), suggesting that this gene may\nplay a key role in gastric tumorigenesis. We therefore used gastric cancer as our research\nmodel to determine whether ppGalNAc-T2 is correlated with cell invasion and\nmetastasis.\n\nTo further explore the role of ppGalNAc-T2 in gastric cancer, SGC7901 cells were used to\nreconstitute the expression of ppGalNAc-T2 by stable overexpression (SGC7901-T2s) or\ndownregulation (SGC7901-T2as) of ppGalNAc-T2. Transfection efficiency was measured using\nfluorescence microscopy to detect expression of the plasmid-encoded eGFP gene (Fig. 2). Then, the ppGalNAc-T2 mRNA and\nprotein levels in the SGC7901 cells were measured by RT-PCR and western blot analysis,\nrespectively. When compared with untreated cells, ppGalNAc-T2 transcripts were increased\nin the pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 sense vector transfected cells (P<0.05) (Fig. 3A and B). Consistent with the\nRT-PCR results, the expression of the ppGalNAc-T2 protein was clearly increased in this\ngroup (P<0.05) (Fig. 3C and\nD). Furthermore, ppGalNAc-T2 mRNA and protein expression was suppressed in the\nSGC7901-T2as group when compared to the untreated group (P<0.05), while no\ndifference was found between the control group and the untreated cells (P>0.05).\nThe above results indicate the successful construction of the ppGalNAc-T2 overexpression\nor downregulation cell lines. These stable cell lines can be effectively used to further\nexamine the role of ppGalNAc-T2.\n\nTo examine whether modulation of ppGalNAc-T2 expression affects the tumorigenic\nproperties of the gastric cancer cells, we measured the abilities of in\nvitro cell proliferation by MTT assay. The untreated SGC7901, control, as well\nas the SGC7901-T2s and SGC7901-T2as cells were grown in culture for 5 days. The ability of\ncell proliferation in the SGC7901-T2s cells was decreased compared with the control or\nuntreated cells but increased in the SGC7901-T2as cells (P>0.05) (Fig. 4). Treatment of SGC7901 cells with\nppGalNAc-T2 sense vectors was associated with a time-dependent inhibition of cell growth,\nwhereas no significant inhibitory effect was observed in the untreated and control cells.\nThese results indicate that multi-step molecular events are necessary for the function of\nppGalNAc-T2 to switch the SGC7901 cells from a proliferative state to an inhibited state\nof cell growth.\n\nAdhesion is a key event in the metastasic process where cells must first adhere to the\nECM prior to its degradation. To examine whether ppGalNAc-T2 expression is associated with\nadhesion of gastric cancer, in vitro adhesion assay was carried out to\nevaluate the adhesive ability of the untreated SGC7901, control, SGC7901-T2s and\nSGC7901-T2as cells. The ability of cell adhesion in the SGC7901-T2s group cells was\ndecreased compared with untreated or control SGC7901 cells (P<0.05), but increased\nin the SGC7901-T2as group cells at different time points (P<0.05) (Figs. 5A, 5B and 5C).\n\nTo further investigate the behavior of cells in the presence of ECM components, adhesion\nassays were carried out in the presence of HA and FN. Increased cell-cell signaling and\ncontact is also mediated by increased expression of cell adhesion molecules. The control,\nuntreated, as well as the SGC7901-T2s and SGC7901-T2as group cells were cultured in the\npresence of HA and FN. Overexpression of ppGalNAc-T2 led to an average of 32.5%\ndecreased adhesive ability compared with untreated clones at different time points.\nConversely, downregulated ppGalNAc-T2 expression caused an average of 58.2%\nincrease in the adhesive ability in the SGC7901-T2as group at different time points (Fig. 5B and C), while no difference was\nfound between the control group and the untreated SGC7901 cells (P>0.05). These\nresults suggest that ppGalNAc-T2 expression is associated with the adhesion of SGC7901\ncells in vitro; therefore, overexpression of ppGalNAc-T2 has a\nsignificant anti-adhesion effect at all intervals.\n\nSince ECM degradation is key to tumor cell invasion, the in vitro\ninvasiveness of these cell lines through Matrigel coated membranes was compared. Different\ninvasiveness was observed in the control, untreated, as well as the SGC7901-T2s and\nSGC7901-T2as group cells, respectively (Fig.\n6). The control group cells showed little invasion in comparison to the untreated\ncells (P>0.05), whereas overexpression of ppGalNAc-T2 in SGC7901-T2s cells\ndecreased their migratory capacity (P<0.05). By contrast, downregulation of\nppGalNAc-T2 increased the invasive ability in the SGC7901-T2as group (P<0.05).\nThese results suggested that ppGalNAc-T2 expression was inversely associated with the\ninvasiveness of cells in vitro. The inverse correlation tendency between\nppGalNAc-T2 expression in SGC7901 cells and their in vitro invasive\nability indicates that ppGalNAc-T2 is likely to be a metastasis suppressor gene in\nSGC7901.\n\nAmong the MMP family that has been identified, MMP-2 is considered a key enzyme since it\nis responsible for degradation of the ECM. Meanwhile, MMP-2 activity can be activated by\nMMP-14, and this activity may be involved in tumor invasion and metastasis. Therefore, to\ninvestigate whether the metastasic inhibitory effect of ppGalNAc-T2 resulted from the\nsuppression of MMP-2 and MMP-14 expression, MMP-2 and MMP-14 mRNA and protein levels were\nmeasured. Using RT-PCR, we found that the expression of MMP-2 at the mRNA level was lower\nin the SGC7901-T2s group than in the SGC7901-T2as group (P<0.05), and there was no\ndifference between untreated and control group cells (P>0.05) (Fig. 7A and B). However, there was no\nevident change on the mRNA transcriptional expression of MMP-14.\n\nThe protein levels from whole-cell lysates of MMP-2 and MMP-14 were further assessed by\nwestern blot analysis (Fig. 7C and\nD), respectively. We found that the expression of MMP-2 at the protein level was\nincreased in the ppGalNAc-T2-downregulation cells, but decreased in the\nppGalNAc-T2-overexpressing cells (P<0.05). Similar to the RT-PCR results, the\nexpression of the MMP-14 protein presented no noticeable difference in all groups\n(P>0.05). The changes in the protein levels of MMP-2 and MMP-14 coincided with\ntheir mRNA levels, indicating that ppGalNAc-T2 might regulate MMP-2 but not MMP-14\nexpressions at the transcriptional level.\n\nTGF-\u03b21 promotes tumor progression through the upregulation of MMP-2. To\ninvestigate whether the MMP-2 inhibitory effect of ppGalNAc-T2 resulted from the\nsuppression of TGF-\u03b21 expression, TGF-\u03b21 mRNA and protein levels were\nmeasured. The SGC7901 cells transfected with ppGalNAc-T2 sense vectors exhibited a direct\nreduction at the levels of TGF-\u03b21 mRNA and protein (P<0.05) (Fig. 7). Meanwhile, the expression of\nTGF-\u03b21 in the SGC7901-T2as group was contrary to that in the SGC7901-T2s group\n(P<0.05). The change of TGF-\u03b21 at the mRNA and protein level displayed a\nsimilar trend with that of MMP-2. These results suggest that the MMP-2 inhibitory effect\nby high expression of ppGalNAc-T2 is probably through regulation of TGF-\u03b21\nexpression.\n\nAlthough multiple factors contribute to aberrant glycosylation in cancer, such as the\navailability and localization of nucleotide sugar donors and substrates, one of the primary\nmechanisms seems to be the differential expression of glycosyltransferases involved in the\nsynthesis of glycans. Mucin-type linkages (GalNAc\u03b11-O-Ser/Thr) of proteins begin\nwith the addition of a single GalNAc monosaccharide to a serine or threonine residue on the\npolypeptide. Attachment is catalyzed by a family of glycosyltransferases called the\nUDP-N-acetylgalactosamine: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases (ppGalNAc-Ts, EC\n2.4.1.41), which is a crucial regulatory step (17,18).\nThese structural changes can alter the function of the cell, and its antigenic and adhesive\nproperties, as well as its potential to invade and metastasize. PpGalNAc-T2, an important\nmember of ppGalNAc-Ts, is often variable in cells of different types and differentiation,\nand the expression may change in cancer cells (12). Herein, we investigated the mRNA expression of ppGalNAc-T2 in\nseveral human poorly differentiated cancer cells, including SGC7901 gastric cancer cells\n(19), SHG44 glioma cells (20), SHI-1 leukemia cells (21), A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells\n(22), and HO8910 ovarian cancer\ncells (23). We found that all of\nthese cells could express ppGalNAc-T2, however, mRNA expression in SGC7901 cells appeared to\nbe higher than in other cells. Furthermore, ppGalNAc-T2 was identified as a\nmetastasis-associated gene, which was highly expressed in human acute T cells,\nheptocarcinoma HepG-2 cells, and glioma U251 cells (14,15).\nHowever, the expression of ppGalNAc-T2 in gastric cancer has not been previously reported.\nIn this regard, we first demonstrated that SGC7901 cells show significantly increased\nexpression of ppGalNAc-T2 compared with other poorly differentiated tumor, suggesting that\nexpression levels of ppGalNAc-T2 in gastric cancer are associated with a high risk of\nmetastasis.\n\nTumor metastasis occurs by a series of steps including cell attachment, invasion, and\nproliferation, and is regulated by extremely complicated mechanisms (24,25). For example, patients with gastric cancer generally have\nmetastasis when clinically examined. There is a low 5-year survival rate and poor quality of\nlife even after tumor resection. The SGC-7901 human gastric cell line was first established\nfrom the metastatic lymph node of a 56-year-old female patient suffering from gastric\nadenocarcinoma (26). To examine the\npotential anti-metastasic effects of ppGalNAc-T2, proliferation, adhesion and invasion\nassays were performed on SGC7901 cells. Regardless of the exact mechanism of ppGalNAc-T2 in\nthe cell metastatic process, pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2 sense vectors or pEGFP-C1-ppGalNAc-T2\nantisense vectors were transfected into SGC7901 cells to reconstitute the expression of\nppGalNAc-T2, focusing on the changes in the characteristics of cell metastasis-associated\nbehavior. In ppGalNAc-T2 overexpressed cells (SGC7901-T2s group), proliferation, adhesion,\nand invasion were decreased compared with untreated SGC7901 cells, whereas the values for\nthe same assays were increased in ppGalNAc-T2 downregulated cells (SGC7901-T2as group).\n\nSince adhesion is considered a key in regulating cell growth at the metastatic secondary\nsite (27,28), in this study we first proved\nppGalNAc-T2 expression affected the adhesive ability of SGC7901 cells by in\nvitro cell adhesion assay. In addition, the degradation of basal membrane and ECM\nof primary tumor are crucial steps for tumor invasion and metastasis. We also looked at\nadhesion of the cells on various ECM components including FN and HA. The ppGalNAc-T2\nantisense vectors transfected cells attached better to FN and HA than any other cell line.\nThus, upregulated expression of ppGalNAc-T2 is likely to inhibit the growth of the cancer\ncells in the metastatic sites due to a decrease in cell adhesive ability.\n\nProteins of the MMP family are involved in the breakdown of ECM in normal physiological\nprocesses, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in\ndisease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis (29). Among the many MMPs that have been identified, MMP-2 encodes\nan enzyme which degrades type IV collagen, the major structural component of basement\nmembranes. MMP-14 activates MMP-2 protein, and this activity may be involved in tumor\ninvasion (30). Thus, we examined the\neffect of ppGalNAc-T2 on the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-14 in SGC7901 cells. Our study\nrevealed that expression of ppGalNAc-T2 had an inverse correlation with the expression of\nMMP-2 at the mRNA and protein levels. It is highly likely that ppGalNAc-T2 regulates the\nproliferation, adhesion, and invasiveness, all of which are essential steps for the\nestablishment of metastasis of SGC7901 cells, due to the regulation of the MMP-2 signaling\npathway. However, it did not exhibit any apparent correlation with MMP-14 expression. MMP-14\nhas been shown to interact with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) (31). Further experiments are required to\ndetermine if ppGalNAc-T2 functions in SGC7901 cells, in part, by TIMP-2 signaling\npathways.\n\nThe multifunctional cytokine transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) plays a\ndual role in the process of carcinogenesis by promoting tumor progression by enhancing\nmigration, invasion and survival of tumor cells. TGF-\u03b21 has been proven to play a\nkey role in activating MMP-2 (32). We\nalso investigated the effect of ppGalNAc-T2 on the expression of TGF-\u03b21 in SGC7901\ncells. Consistent with this concept, we confirmed that in the SGC7901-T2s group,\nTGF-\u03b21 was decreased compared with control or untreated cells, whereas\ndownregulation of ppGalNAc-T2 mRNA and protein levels induced activation of TGF-\u03b21.\nThese results suggest that the MMP-2 inhibitory effect by high expression of ppGalNAc-T2 is\nprobably through regulation of TGF-\u03b21 expression.\n\nIn conclusion, the present study demonstrated that high expression of ppGalNAc-T2\nsignificantly inhibits the metastasic ability of SGC7901 human gastric cancer cells. The\nproposed anti-growth and anti-metastasic mechanisms might be mediated through the inhibition\nof MMP-2 and TGF-\u03b21. These results indicate that ppGalNAc-T2 is also a metastasis\nregulation gene of human gastric cancer. We suggest that ppGalNAc-T2 can be used as a novel\ntherapeutic target for human gastric treatment. However, to provide a potential valuable\ntherapeutic strategy for gastric cancer metastasis, it is necessary to further investigate\nthe underlying molecular mechanism of ppGalNAc-T2 in suppressing SGC7901 cell\nmetastasis."}
