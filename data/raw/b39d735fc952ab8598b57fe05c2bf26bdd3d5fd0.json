IC is classified into standard precautions * Corresponding author. (SPs) and expanded precautions (EPs). SPs are implemented in all patients regardless of their diagnosis. SPs include hand hygiene, appropriate handling of bodily fluids and waste, and prevention of injuries with sharp objects. In contrast, EPs are applied in specific situations depending on the mode of disease transmission, i.e. contact, droplet, and airborne precautions [1] .\n\nLittle is known about health-care students' knowledge of SPs and IC in Saudi Arabia. A recent literature review revealed that only one study, conducted in 2012 at the King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia, has examined knowledge of SPs among Saudi-Arabian medical students in their clinical years [2] . The researchers reported that participants' knowledge was low, and that self-directed learning and informal bedside practices were the main sources of knowledge. In contrast, many studies have addressed this crucial aspect of IC worldwide. In 2008, a study conducted at Rouen University, Normandy, France, reported differing levels of knowledge for different categorized domains (e.g., hand hygiene, nosocomial infection, and SPs) [3] . The study targeted four specialties (Medicine, Nursing, Radiography, and Physiotherapy). The best scores were related to SPs, and the university curriculum was the primary source of students' knowledge. Another study conducted in 2014 at the University of Tirana, Tirana, Albania, demonstrated that students in four specialties (Medicine, Physiotherapy, Radiography, and Nursing) had a moderate knowledge of IC [4] . Formal, in-class training was their main information source.\n\nStudents at the King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS) experience early exposure to clinical practice. The diverse colleges of the KSAU-HS include Medicine, Dentistry, Applied Medical Sciences, Nursing, and Pharmacy. Academic lectures and procedural skill sessions on IC are part of the curricula of all KSAU-HS colleges. During the clinical phase, students are at an elevated risk of becoming infected or transmitting diseases to patients and their colleagues. In addition, the risk of sharp object injuries is constant [1, 5, 6] .\n\nKnowing and practicing SPs and IC are crucial for the safety of both health-care workers and patients. Hand hygiene is the most practical and cost-effective method of reducing infection transmission [7, 8] . Although hand hygiene is crucial and simple, compliance with hand hygiene practice is suboptimal among health-care providers (<40%) [9, 10] . Consequently, in this study, we assessed knowledge of SPs and IC among clinical students attending colleges of the KSAU-HS and identified their primary information source.\n\nThis cross-sectional study utilized a questionnaire to assess students' knowledge. The KSAU-HS was formally established in 2005 in response to positive feedback about postgraduate programs in various medical fields offered by the National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, since the mid-1980s. The main campus of the KSAU-HS is in Riyadh, with two additional campuses in Jeddah and Al-Ahsa. This study took place at the Riyadh campus in 2017 at the following colleges: Medicine, Dentistry, Applied Medical Sciences, Nursing, and Pharmacy.\n\nIn this study, the target population was clinical health sciences students in the following years of study: Medicine (fifth and sixth years); Dentistry (second semester of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth years); Applied Medical Sciences (third and fourth years); Nursing (third and fourth years); and Pharmacy (third, fourth, and fifth years). The total number of clinical students across all five colleges was 655. We included students of both sexes; however, we excluded students from the Health Informatics College and students in the basic science or preparatory phases of their designated colleges. We analyzed the data using Raosoft software (Raosoft, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) with a margin of error of 5% and a confidence interval of 95%. Similar to the response distribution obtained from the study conducted at King Faisal University (26.7%), the sample size in this study was 207 students. The participants were selected using convenience sampling.\n\nThe proposals for this study began on January 19, 2017. Ethics approval was granted by the King Abdullah International Medical Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on February 27, 2017. E-form questionnaires with a brief introduction about the study's aims and importance were emailed to participants on February 29, 2017, and re-sent to non-respondents on March 4, 2017. The consent form was attached. Data collection was completed on May 13, 2017, and 129 responses were obtained. The adopted questionnaire examined demographic data, information sources, and five domains consisting of 41 items measuring students' knowledge of SPs and IC. Demographic information included sex, college, and year. The five domains comprised: general concept of IC and SPs (five questions); hand hygiene (10 questions); personal protective equipment (PPE; nine questions); disposal of and injuries from sharp objects (eight questions); and health-care providers' care (nine questions). The questions were closed-ended true/false (34 questions) or multiple-choice questions (seven questions). Each correct answer was worth one point (maximum score, 41 points). The information source question was asked prior to the questions about the five domains. The questionnaire was in English, which is the formal teaching language at the KSAU-HS.\n\nExcel \u00ae (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) was used for data entry, and SPSS version 24 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for data management and analysis. The cutoff for sufficient knowledge of SPs and IC was 24/41 (60%), consistent with the study conducted at King Faisal University [2] . Thus, a score of 23 or lower was considered to reflect insufficient knowledge. The chi-squared test was used to assess the relationship between knowledge and categoric variables expressed as percentages and frequencies (e.g., knowledge and speciality). The t-test was used to assess the difference between knowledge and quantitative values expressed as means and standard deviation (e.g., domain and sex). The significance level was set at p < 0.05.\n\nOne hundred twenty-nine students responded (67 men and 62 women). The proportions of participants from each college were as follows: Medicine, 58.1% (n = 75); Dentistry, 14% (n = 18); Applied Medical Sciences, 13.2% (n = 17); Nursing, 10.9% (n = 14); and Pharmacy, 3.9% (n = 5).\n\nThe sources of information on IC and SPs reported by the students comprised: self-directed learning, 48.8% (n = 63); informal practical learning in the ward (e.g., at bedside), 58.9% (n = 76); formal curricular teaching, 66.7% (n = 86); and IC courses, 58.9% (n = 76). For this question, participants could choose more than one source.\n\nThe percentage of respondents with sufficient knowledge on IC and SPs was 73.6% (n = 95): 67.2% (n = 45) of men and 80.6% (n = 50) of women. There was no significant difference between the sexes in knowledge of SPs and IC (p = 0.082). The correct response rates for each question are provided in Table 1 .\n\nDifferences between the sexes in the correct response rates for each domain are shown in Table 2 . General concepts of SPs were answered correctly 81.6% of the time, followed by hand hygiene (68.2%), PPE (66.5%), disposal of and injuries from sharp objects (54.5%), and health-care providers' care (53.05%).\n\nStudents' knowledge of SPs and IC at each college is shown in Table 3 . Students' knowledge of SPs and IC at each college was as fol- Table 1 The five domains of questions and their correct response rates. \n\nThe primary objectives of this study were to assess knowledge and information sources on SPs and IC among Saudi-Arabian health sciences students. The participants of this study demonstrated acceptable knowledge compared with the participants of the study conducted at King Faisal University (73.6% vs. 26.7%, respectively) [2] . In this study, the primary information source reported by students was formal curricular teaching, consistent with the findings of Tavolacci et al. [3] and Bello et al. [11] . However, this result contrasted with that of the study performed at King Faisal University, which reported self-directed learning and informal, bedside practice as the main information sources [2] . This may explain the difference in knowledge levels between this study and the study conducted at King Faisal University.\n\nIn this study, general concept of SPs, hand hygiene, and PPE were the most well-known domains, whereas disposal of and injuries from sharp objects and health-care providers' care were the least well-known. In the study performed at King Faisal University, hand hygiene and health-care providers' care were the most well-known domains, whereas management of sharp objects and PPE were the least well-known [2] . In contrast, Tavolacci et al. [3] reported that SPs and hand hygiene were the most well-known domains, whereas nosocomial infection knowledge was the least well-known. These findings show that knowledge of how to handle sharp objects requires improvement; therefore, the curriculum should be amended to increase its emphasis of these issues. Furthermore, IC should be introduced to health sciences students prior to their clinical phase. In this study, the highest proportion of individuals demonstrating sufficient knowledge was found among nursing students, consistent with the findings of Tavolacci et al. [3] and Garc\u00eda-Zapata et al. [12] .\n\nOther than formal curriculum teaching, the elevated knowledge witnessed in this study may be attributable to the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-COV) in 2015. The MERS-COV outbreak and closure of the main hospital in Riyadh necessitated the launch of a hospital-wide IC training program termed \"Right Care Right Now\" on September 27, 2015 at several facilities, including the KSAU-HS. Students were trained and their competency was assessed by IC practitioners prior to or during their clinical years at the postgraduate center of the KSAU-HS. Such interventions, theoretical knowledge, and practical learning may have increased all Saudi-Arabian health-care workers' knowledge of IC [13] .\n\nIn this study, we revealed that knowledge of SPs and IC among Saudi-Arabian health sciences students is satisfactory, with no significant differences between sexes or between the College of Medicine and other colleges. Formal curricular teaching at the KSAU-HS is the main source of information on SPs and IC, and is effective at raising the level of knowledge on SPs and IC.\n\nA cross-sectional design using a questionnaire as the instrument of data collection restricts the observation of behavior, skills, and compliance of students during practice. Moreover, the number of respondents (n = 129) was below the sample size (n = 207).\n\nNo funding sources.\n\nNone declared.\n\nEthics approval was granted by the ethical review board of the King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), Riyadh KSA. The approval letter was issued on the February 27, 2017 (No. SP17/041/R)."}
