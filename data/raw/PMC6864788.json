{"title": "Synthetic, Structural, and Anticancer Activity Evaluation Studies on Novel Pyrazolylnucleosides", "body": "The chemistry of nucleosides has been extensively studied and several analogs have been found to exhibit potential as fungicidal, antitumor, and antiviral agents [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. Modifications in both the heterocyclic bases and the sugar moieties have led to active and safer nucleoside analogues that have found applications as agents effective against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and also against viral infections caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV types 1 and 2), varicella zoster virus (VZV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [8,9]. Nucleoside and nucleotide modifications resulted in an increased interest in the regio- and stereoselective synthesis of nucleosides [10,11]. Moreover, modified nucleosides and nucleotides with a restricted conformation have been used to reach a particular conformation of a rotamer to study the affinity of a biomacromolecule for its natural ligand as well as the molecular recognition in an oligonucleotide chain (RNA/DNA) [12,13,14,15]. Similar studies of anti-sense and anti-gene oligonucleotides (ONs) as potential and selective inhibitors of gene expression [16,17,18,19] and their use as anti-tumor or anti-viral agents [20,21,22,23] have also influenced the developments in the field of nucleic acid-based drugs. Among the nucleoside analogues with significant biological activities, dideoxynucleoside-based compounds such as 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxycytidine (ddC) [24], 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxyinosine (ddI) [24], and 3\u2032-azidothymidine (AZT) [25] are effective therapeutic agents for the treatment of AIDS, while ribavirin (virazole) [26,27] is an antiviral drug (Figure 1). Similarly, other dideoxynucleosides such as d4T (2\u2032,3\u2032-didehydro-3\u2032-deoxythymidine, stavudine) [28,29] and AZddU (3\u2032-azido-2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxyuridine) [30] have gone through clinical studies. Different nucleosides isolated from nature such as oxazinomycin [31], pyrazofurin [32,33], showdomycin [34,35], formycin A, and formycin B [36,37] have shown antibiotic properties and have also been found to exhibit anticancer and/or antiviral activities (Figure 1). These examples and new developments in the chemistry and biology of these compounds and their analogs [38,39,40,41,42] have motivated us to work in this area and have led us to investigate the interesting chemical and biological properties of novel nucleoside-based compounds.\n\nDespite the developments in nucleoside chemistry, the clinical use of nucleosides has some drawbacks due to their side-effects and primary or acquired drug resistance [43]. Therefore, the search for the design of new and effective nucleoside-based analogues continues to motivate studies in this field. Our efforts toward this goal have led to the synthesis of twenty novel pyrazolylnucleosides with new structures and potent antiviral and antitumoral behaviors. In this regard, two regioisomers for each pyrazole derivative have been produced and characterized using spectroscopic techniques such as 1H NMR, 13C NMR, NOESY, HMBC, IR, and mass spectroscopy. All compounds were evaluated against the National Cancer Institute (NCI)\u2019s panel of 60 human tumor cell lines for their anticancer activities, and for their antiviral activities against representative viruses. \n\nIn our approach, the synthesis of the target compounds 5a\u2013e and 6a\u2013e was achieved in two steps starting from the already reported 3-cyanomethyl-5-aryl-1H-pyrazoles 1a\u2013e [44] and the well-known 2-deoxy-3,5-di-O-p-toluoyl-\u03b1-d-ribofuranosyl chloride (2) [45] (Scheme 1). Treatment of pyrazoles 1a\u2013e with sodium hydride in acetonitrile and the subsequent addition of chlorosugar 2 gave two regioisomers of the modified pyrazolyl nucleosides 3a\u2013e (by coupling 2 with the N-1 nitrogen of the pyrazole derivatives) and 4a\u2013e (by coupling chlorosugar 2 with the N-2 nitrogen of the pyrazole derivatives) in 58\u201365% yields. The products 3a\u2013e and 4a\u2013e were de-toluoylated by using sodium methoxide in methanol, resulting in the formation of the corresponding modified nucleosides 5a\u2013e and 6a\u2013e in 70\u201380% yields, respectively. \n\nPyrazoles with no substitution on either of the two N ring atoms can be alkylated to produce two regioisomers under strongly basic conditions. The anion generated produces the two resonance forms that react with chlorosugar 2 in the glycosidation step, leading to mixtures of two regioisomeric pyrazolyl nucleosides (i.e., 3a\u2013e and 4a\u2013e) (Scheme 2). \n\nThe structural identification of the isomeric disubstituted pyrazolyl nucleosides, based on their 1H NMR spectral data (See Supplementary Materials), has been reported in the literature [46,47,48]. It has been observed that the anomeric protons in the isomeric pyrazolyl nucleosides exhibit different proton chemical shifts. The anomeric proton adjacent to N-1 of the pyrazole compounds 3a\u2013e and 5a\u2013e would appear downfield when compared to the anomeric proton adjacent to N-2 of the pyrazole compounds 4a\u2013e and 6a\u2013e [46,47,48]. In addition to using 1H NMR chemical shifts, extensive NOE and 2D NMR experiments have been employed to confirm the structures of the isomeric pyrazolyl nucleosides. Using 1H and 13C NMR studies, we confirmed the positional assignments of the isomeric pyrazolyl nucleosides synthesized in the present work (Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3). The anomeric proton of the analogues 5a\u2013e generally appeared at 0.14\u20130.19 ppm upfield when compared to the corresponding proton in the 1H NMR spectra of its corresponding 6 series isomers. This is in agreement with observations for other 1,5- and 1,3-disubstituted pyrazole nucleosides [46,47,48]. We found that the effect was less pronounced in the 3 series of nucleosides as compared to the 4 series nucleosides where this difference was in the range of 0.04\u20130.14 ppm. The 13C chemical shift of the \u2013CH2CN bearing pyrazole carbon atom can help distinguish between positional isomers. In the 3 and 5 series of nucleosides, this carbon signal was 4\u201311 ppm downfield relative to the corresponding signal in the 4 and 6 series nucleosides. In most cases, the aryl bearing pyrazole carbon in the 3 and 5 series was 4\u20137 ppm upfield relative to the corresponding carbon in the 4 and 6 series. However, in the case of 3d versus 4d, the difference was small and reversed, making the aryl bearing pyrazole carbon less reliable for use in positional assignments.\n\nIn order to confirm the above positional assignments, we performed 2D NMR experiments (NOESY and HMBC) on the two pairs of compounds (i.e., one pair consisting of the ditoluoyl protected nucleosides 3d and 4d and another pair consisting of the deprotected nucleosides 5d and 6d) (Table 4). The results of the HMBC experiments rely on the fact that the anomeric proton may see the aryl bearing pyrazole carbon in 3d and 5d, but not in 4d and 6d, while the NOESY results would explain the spatial proximity of the anomeric proton to either the protons in the \u2013CH2CN group or to the ortho protons of the aryl group. Our results verified the positional properties at the pyrazole ring in the four compounds and are summarized in Table 4.\n\nThe isomers of the 3 series nucleosides generally had higher Rf values on the TLC than the corresponding isomer of the 4 series of nucleosides. The same was observed for the isomers of the 5 series relative to those in the 6 series of nucleosides. \n\nThe anticancer and toxicity of compounds 5a\u2013e and 6a\u2013e were evaluated by using the National Cancer Institute\u2032s 60 human cancer cell lines. Compounds 5a\u2013e, where the sugar is attached to N-1 of the pyrazole ring, were found to be inactive against all the cell lines irrespective of the substituent on the aromatic ring. In the other series, compounds 6a, 6b, and 6c with 4-methyl, 4-methoxy, and 4-fluoro substituents, respectively, at the aromatic ring were also inactive. However, compounds 6d and 6e with 4-chloro and 4-bromo substituents at the aromatic ring, respectively, showed inhibition against multiple anticancer cell lines. The GI50 (cytostatic parameter) and LC50 (toxicity parameter) values of 6d and 6e for the selected cell lines are given in Table 5. Compound 6d showed inhibition in 19 cell lines, and was most active against the renal cancer cell line UO-31 and breast cancer cell line HS 578T with GI50 < 20 \u00b5M in both cases. The most active compound was 6e, which showed moderate inhibition in 39 cell lines. It showed significant inhibition against lung cancer cell line Hop-92 with a GI50 of 9.3 \u00b5M and breast cancer cell line HS 578T with a GI50 of 3.0 \u00b5M. Most importantly, both compounds (6d and 6e) did not show any toxicity, even at the highest concentration tested, as indicated by their high LC50 values. \n\nThe pyrazolyl nucleosides 5a\u2013e and 6a\u2013e were also examined for their antiviral activities against a number of viruses such as Simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2), thymidine kinase-deficient (TK-) strains of HSV-1, Vaccinia virus, para-influenza-3 virus, Sindbis virus, Coxsackie virus, Punta toro virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Coxsackie virus B4 (CV-B4), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), feline corona virus, and feline herpes virus. However, none of these compounds showed any significant activity against any of these viruses.\n\nReactions were conducted under an atmosphere of nitrogen in anhydrous solvents. Column chromatography was carried out by using silica gel (100\u2013200 mesh). Melting points were determined in a concentrated H2SO4 acid bath and were uncorrected. Analytical TLCs were performed on pre-coated Merck silica gel 60F254 plates; the spots were detected either by using UV light or by charring with 4% alcoholic sulfuric acid. The IR spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer 2000 FT-IR spectrophotometer (Waltham, MA, USA). The optical rotations were measured with a Bellingham-Stanley AD 220 polarimeter and the concentrations expressed as g/mL. The 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 300 spectrometer (Billerica, MA, USA) at 300 and 75.5 MHz, respectively in CDCl3, DMSO-d6, or CD3CN. All 2D measurements were performed in acetone-d6 on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer (Billerica, MA, USA). Chemical shifts are relative to internal TMS. Assignments were based on COSY, NOESY, HMBC (by using Bruker\u2019s microprogram inv4gslplrnd, which includes the low-pass J-filter to suppress one-bond correlations), HSQC, and JRES spectra. The chemical shift values were reported as \u03b4 ppm relative to TMS used as the internal standard and the coupling constants (J) were measured in Hz. The ESI-HRMS spectra of all compounds were recorded on a JEOL JMS-AX505W high-resolution mass spectrometer (Tokyo, Japan) in positive ion mode by using the matrix HEDS (bis-hydroxyethylsulfide) doped with sodium acetate. Acetonitrile was used after distillation over freshly ignited potassium carbonate.\n\nA solution of 3-cyanomethyl-5-arylpyrazole (1a\u2013e, 15 mmol) in acetonitrile (190 mL) was added into a stirred mixture of sodium hydride (22.5 mmol) in acetonitrile (30 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere at 30\u201335 \u00b0C, and continuously stirred for 30 min. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0 \u00b0C and 1-\u03b1-chloro-3,5-di-O-toluoyl-1,2-dideoxyribose (2, 15 mmol) was added and the contents stirred at 0 \u00b0C for 2.5 to 3 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by using silica gel TLC. On completion, the reaction mixture was poured over ice-cold water and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 \u00d7 50 mL). The combined organic layer was washed with water (2 \u00d7 50 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the residue thus obtained was column chromatographed over silica gel with ethyl acetate (8\u201310%) in petroleum ether as the eluent to afford the pyrazolyl nucleosides 3a\u2013e and 4a\u2013e in 31 to 35% and 24 to 29% yields, respectively.\n\n2\u2032-Deoxy-1\u2032-(3-cyanomethyl-5-p-methylphenyl)pyrazolyl-3\u2032,5\u2032-di-O-toluoyl-\u03b2-d-ribofuranose (3a): Obtained as a white semisolid in a 34% yield.

Briefly, the panel was organized into nine subpanels representing a diverse histology: leukemia, melanoma, and cancers of the lung, colon, kidney, ovary, breast, prostate, and central nervous system. The cells were grown in supplemented RPM1 1640 medium for 24 h. For the five dose study, the test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and incubated with cells at five concentrations with 10-fold dilutions, the highest being 10\u22124 M and the others being 10\u22125, 10\u22126, 10\u22127, and 10\u22128 M. The assay was terminated by the addition of cold trichloroacetic acid, and the cells were fixed and stained with sulforhodamine B. The bound stain was solubilized, and the absorbance was read on an automated plate reader. The cytostatic parameter, which determines the 50% growth inhibition (GI50) of the tumor cells, was calculated from time zero, control growth, and the absorbance at the five concentration levels. The cytotoxic parameter, lethal concentration (LC50 is the concentration of a drug resulting in a 50% reduction in the measured protein at the end of the drug treatment when compared to that at the beginning), indicating a net loss of cells following the treatment, was calculated as the average of two independent experiments.\n\nWe successfully achieved the synthesis of twenty novel pyrazolyl nucleosides 3a\u2013e, 4a\u2013e, 5a\u2013e, and 6a\u2013e, which have been characterized in detail by using various NMR spectroscopic techniques such as 1H NMR, 13C NMR, NOESY, HMBC, etc. The pyrazolyl nucleosides 5a\u2013e and 6a\u2013e were screened for anticancer activities on 60 human tumor cell lines, and we identified one compound 6e, which showed good activity against 39 cancer cell lines and showed significant inhibition against lung cancer cell line Hop-92 (GI50 9.3 \u00b5M) and breast cancer cell line HS 578T (GI50 3.0 \u00b5M). Our studies have demonstrated the potential of newly synthesized pyrazolyl-nucleosides that will be pursued further. "}
