Wang Resin (0.22 mmol/gram; higher loading resin inhibited downstream cross-metathesis reactions) was activated with carbonyl diimidazole (CDI, 10 eq.) in dimethylformamide (DMF) for 4 hours followed by treatment with 1,3-diaminopropane (10 eq) in DMF for 4 hours. Amino acids were coupled using 3.1 eq. of Fmoc-AA-OH where AA is Phe, Pro, Gly(allyl) or N-Me-Phe, 2.9 eq. HATU, 1% DBU, and 5 eq. DIPEA in DMF for 2 hours. Deprotection of Fmoc was accomplished using 20% piperidine in DMF for 1 hour. Where N-Me amino acids were needed that were not commercially available, Fmoc was first removed using standard protocol followed by treatment of the resin with 3 eq. of 2-nitrobenzene sulfonyl chloride (NOSYL-Cl) and 5 eq. of collidine in DCM for 2 hours. This activated resin was then treated with 8 mL of TMS-diazomethane and 0.5 mL of methanol in DCM overnight. Methylation was monitored by HPLC.\n\nTo remove the NOSYL group, resin was treated with 3 eq. of 2-mercaptoethanol and 5 eq. of DBU for 1 hour. 1\n\nAll compounds were purified via Shimadzu preparative HPLC using a C18 column and water/acetonitrile. Compound purity was assessed via analytical HPLC (Shimadzu) using a C18 column and a1%/min linear gradient of CH 3 CN/water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, from 30 to 50% CH 3 CN. NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian MR-400 instrument. High-resolution mass spectrometry was conducted by the University of Buffalo service facility.\n\nAnalytical HPLC trace of purified compound 2Z (220 nm): \n\nFluorescence titrations were carried out in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl 2 . 500 \u00b5L of compound at 20 nM -1 \u00b5M (varied based on K D ) was added to a quartz cuvette. High concentration stock of RNA from 10-50 \u00b5M was added in 1-10 \u00b5L increments. The solution in the cuvette was mixed thoroughly via pipetting and allowed to equilibrate for 10 min. Fluorescence was then measured three times at one minute intervals.\n\nThe absolute change in absorbance in each case is a function of both the compound concentration and the slit width of the instrument.\n\nHIV FSS RNA + 2E \n\nRepresentative traces from SPR. Streptavidin was immobilized to 2000 RU using EDC/NHS coupling to a CM5 chip (GE), then the surface was blocked with ethanolamine. 500 RU of biotinylated RNA was immobilized. Injections were repeated twice for consistency. \n\nFor each compound, the scatter plot shows gating for singlet live cells via a negative propidium iodide signal. The histogram is fluorescence intensity of the compound gated for live singlet cells. \n\nImages below show direct imaging of compounds in HEK 293T cells. Cells were grown in 10% FBS, 1% anti-anti (penicillin-streptomycin + fungizone) in DMEM at 37 \u00baC and 5% CO 2 . Approximately 1 x 10 4 cells were plated in each well of a 96 well plate. Cells were treated with a 10 micromolar solution of compound for 12 hours, washed twice with PBS, and imaged using an Olympus IX70 microscope with 311 ms exposure.\n\nReplicate infectivity assay and analysis of viral proteins by western blot: Data shown in Figure 3 is a composite of two experiments, with 1Z results derived from a different experiment than results shown for other compounds. To allow direct comparison of 1Z and new compounds described herein, the full results of the experiment from which the 1Z data are derived are shown below. Note that effects on infectivity and changes in protein levels are comparable between the two, where compounds and concentrations overlap. Producer cell lysate western blots: In parallel with the western blots of virion proteins shown in Figure  4 , cell lysates from producer HEK293T cells were run on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to membranes, and probed with anti-p24 and anti-reverse transcriptase (anti-RT) antibodies. Ratios for RT to p24 (Gag) obtained by densitometry relative to control (set at 1.0) are shown. The band labeled \"cell background\" is an endogenous protein from the HEK293T cells that is cross-reactive with the anti-RT antibody. \n\nSubconfluent monolayers of 293T cells cultured in 6 well plates were co-transfected with 2 \u00b5g of pHIV NL4-3 plasmid 2 and 0.2 \u00b5g Vesicular Stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) protein expression vector using polyethylenimine (PEI). After five hours, the media was changed and the new media was supplemented with the compounds. Forty-eight hours later, supernatants were harvested and the virus-like particles (VLPs) were purified through a 20% (wt/vol) sucrose cushion at 21,000 \u00d7 g for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. Viral pellets were resuspended in 50 \u00b5l of phosphate-buffered saline solution. Subconfluent monolayers of 293T cells seeded in 35-mm cultures were infected using 10 \u00b5l of the viral pellets resuspension. Compounds were added to the media, and the cells were incubated for 48 hours. Infectivity assays were performed by two different methods: western blotting and percentage of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-positive 293T cells. For western blots, the cells were harvest forty-eight hours after the infection and western blots were carried out according to Lammeli 3 on a 4-15% polyacrylamide gel and the proteins were transferred into a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were incubated with a 1:2500 dilution of the rabbit anti-GFP antibody (AB10145, Millipore) and a 1:1000 dilution of the monoclonal anti-HIV1 p24 antibody (NIH Reagent program). An anti-heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to normalize bands density values. To calculate the percentage of GFP-positive 293T cells, fortyeight hours after the infection, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with DAPI and the fixed cells were mounted using Mowiol (Sigma-Aldrich). Imaging experiments were performed on a Nikon Ti-Eclipse inverted wide-field microscope (Nikon Corp.) using a 10\u00d7 objective lens (NA 0.30), as previously described. Images were collected using a CoolSnap HQ camera (Photometrics) and Nikon NIS Elements software (v4.00.03). Large format images were acquired using differential interference contrast and the following excitation/emission (nanometer ranges) filter sets: 325 to 375/435 to 485 (DAPI), 490 to 520/520 to 550 (yellow fluorescent protein [YFP]), and 565 to 590/590 to 650 (mCherry). In each experiment that was carried out, the total cells and the infected cells of 10 different fields of view were counted by two different observers. The percentage of infected cells for each mutant were normalized by WT. Results are provided on pages S28 and S29.\n\nDetermination of nucleic acid melting temperatures: FSS DNA (IDT) was dissolved to final concentrations of 5 \u00b5M, 1 \u00b5M, and 500 nM in 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl 2 . FSS RNA (IDT) was dissolved to a final concentration of 1 \u00b5M in 10 mM HEPES and 150 mM NaCl. 150 \u00b5L of each solution was loaded into an 8 cell micro-cuvette. Melting was done on a Shimadzu UV-1800 with a thermal melt attachment. The samples were heated to 35 \u00b0C for 5 minutes and then heated at a rate of 5 \u00b0C/min with a 3 minute wait at each measurement interval of 2 \u00b0C for DNA and 0.5 \u00b0C for RNA. Measurements were taken at 260 nm. "}
