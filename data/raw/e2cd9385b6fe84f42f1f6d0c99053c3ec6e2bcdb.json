The macrophages were separated from the infected HeLa cells by a 0.4 M pore size membrane, which would allow the passage of NO from macrophages to infected cells. The NOS inhibitor nitroarginine-methyl-ester (NAME) was added to some cocultures of infected HeLa cells and activated macrophages, in order to confirm that any antiviral effect of activated macrophages was a result of NO, and not inhibitor NAME (0-10 mM). Cells were harvested 5 hr after infection (LPS or IFN alone have no effect upon viral replication and cell lysates analyzed for CVB3 polypeptide 2C as above.\n\nin HeLa cells [ Figure 2C ].) Thus, NO synthesized by activated macrophages can diffuse into infected cells and boundary between the structural proteins and the noninhibit the viral proteases that process the viral polystructural proteins, VP1 and 2A, producing two polyproproteins.\n\nteins.

Purified 3C pro is capable of cleaving the polyprotein GST-3B-3C T , as detected by immunoblotting ( Figure 3B , immunoblot lanes 1 and 2).\n\nIn order to measure the susceptibility of 3C pro to NO, we added a variety of NO donors or their controls to 3C pro and a protease substrate. The NO donor SNAP inhibits the proteolytic activity of 3C pro in a dose-dependent manner, while its control acetyl-penicillamine (AP), which has no nitroso group, has no effect ( Figure 3B ). DTT, an agent capable of reducing the nitrosylation of cysteine residues, reverses the NO inhibition of 3C pro . Another NO donor, spermine NONOate, also inhibits 3C pro cleavage of GST-3B-3CT. DTT also reverses this effect ( Figure 3C ).\n\nTo confirm these results, we used luciferase as another protease substrate (Holzman and Baldwin, 1980; Gorbalenya and Svitkin, 1983; Thompson et al., 1997) . Firefly luciferase serves as a 3C pro substrate because it contains the 3C pro motif AXXQG. Cleavage of luciferase was measured by monitoring luciferase activity. 3C pro cleaves luciferase in a dose-and time-dependent manner ( Figures 4A and 4B ). The NO donors SNAP or spermine NONOate but not their corresponding control drugs inhibit 3C pro activity, and these inhibitions are reversed by DTT ( Figure 4C) . It was previously shown that the (C) The cleavage experiment was then repeated using spermine Zhang et al., 1996) .

Since the active site Cys 147 is the only cysteine residue in 3C pro , the data imply that NO nitrosy-Discussion lates the active site cysteine residue.\n\nThe major finding of this study is that NO inhibits Coxsackievirus replication at least in part by nitrosylating Mutating the CVB3 Protease Active Site Cysteine to Serine Renders the Protease the cysteine residue in the active site of a viral protease, thereby drastically reducing the activity of this enzyme.\n\nThis protease is critical to the life cycle of Picornaviruses.

The resultant mutant protease, C147S 3C pro , still has catalytic activity, if its catalytic site includes a cysteine residue (Stamler et al., 1992b (Stamler et al., , 1997 Stamler, 1994) . For example, NO although at a level greatly reduced from wild-type protease, as Komatsu, 1998) . NO production may thus be a general 3C pro processing acts upstream of viral RNA synthesis mechanism by which the host defends itself against and is necessary to generate 3D pol .
