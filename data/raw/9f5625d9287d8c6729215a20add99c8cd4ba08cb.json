The S protein is a target for antibodies and we model its 3D structure with Discotope2 to identify likely binding sites (B-cell epitopes). We scan peptide sequences from individual viral proteins with NetMHCPan4 and MARIA for MHC-I and MHC-II presentation to identify potential T-cell epitopes. Our MHC-I analysis include common alleles for HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C, and our MHC-II analysis include common alleles of HLA-DR.\n\npresentation and identify potential T-cell epitopes.\n\nis the main trans-membrane glycoprotein expressed on the 66 surface of 2019-nCoV and is responsible for receptor binding 67 and virion entry to cells (1, 18 NetMHCpan4 predicts that a larger number of 2019-nCoV 102 protein sequences can be presented by HLA-C alleles across all 103 genes (Fisher's exact test, p = 4.2e \u221259 ) compared to HLA-A 104 or HLA-B (Table 1) . Specifically, ORF1ab (p = 6.7e \u221254 ), S 105 (p = 1.4e \u22129 ), ORF3a (p = 0.01), and M (p = 0.025) can be 106 better presented by HLA-C alleles after Bonferroni correction. 107 T-cell epitope validation. To estimate the ability of antigen 108 presentation scores to identify 2019-nCoV T-cell epitopes, we 109 performed a validation study with known SARS-CoV CD8 and 110 CD4 T-cell epitopes (Fig. 3) . From 4 independent experimen-111 tal studies (23-26), we identified known CD8 T-cell epitopes 112 (MHC-I, n=17) and known CD4 T-cell epitopes (MHC-II, 113 n=3). We also obtained known non-epitopes (n=1236 and 114 246) for CD4, while for CD8 we include all 9mer sliding win-115 dows of S protein without a known epitope as non-epitopes. 116 MHC-I presentation (with recommended cut-off 98% (17)) has 117 a sensitivity of 82.3%, specificity of 97.0% and an AUC of 0.98 118 (Fig. 3A) . MHC-II presentation (recommended cut-off 95% 119 (15)) has a sensitivity of 66.6%, specificity of 91.1% and an 120 AUC of 0.83 (Fig. 3B ).\n\nGiven the high similarity between SARS-CoV and 2019-122 nCoV proteins, we expect our analysis on 2019-nCoV to per-123 form similarly against future experimentally validated T-cell 124 epitopes. The detailed scores and sequences of this analysis 125 can be found in SI Appendix, Supplementary Tables 7 and 8. 126 Viral mutation and antigen presentation. Human immune se-127 lection pressure has been shown to drive viral mutations which 128 evade immune surveillance (e.g. low MHC presentation). We 129 hypothesize that a similar phenomenon can occur in 2019-130 nCoV. We curated a cohort of 68 viral genomes across four 131 continents and identified 93 point mutations, 2 nonsense mu-132 tation and 1 deletion mutation compared to the published 133 reference genome (5). We plot point mutations against regions 134 of MHC-I or MHC-II presentation in Fig. 4 . The full pro-135 tein sequence and mutation information can be found in SI 136 Appendix, Dataset S2 and S3. We plot results at both medium (A) and high (B) cut-offs for presentation. The X-axis indicates the position of each viral protein, and the y-axis indicates each human HLA gene family. Each blue stripe indicates the fraction of HLA alleles that can present a 9mer or 15mer viral peptide starting from a given position. A peptide being presented by more than one third of common alleles (red) is considered to be high coverage. Fig. S1 ).\n\nNotably, the Cryo-EM solved structure has missing residues 178 in the RBD due to limited electron density. Using modeled 179 structures overcomes this issue. Fig. 6 ). We wanted to 204 explore whether these two linear epitopes are critical for viral 205 interaction with the human entry protein ACE2. After our 206 original analysis, two solved co-crystal structures of 2019-nCoV 207 S protein RBD and human ACE2 become available (19, 20). 208 We ran Discotope2 and obtained strikingly similar results 209 (Fig. 6C and D) . The main antibody binding site substantially 210 overlaps with the interacting surface where ACE2 (yellow) 211 binds to S protein, so an antibody binding to this surface is 212 likely to block viral entry into cells. Table 2 . Top potential epitopes for key 2019-nCoV proteins. We ranked epitopes based on their likely coverage of presentation by MHC-I and MHC-II alleles. S protein 494-508 is highly ranked based on MHC presentation and is also one of the predicted top B-cell epitopes, localized near the S protein receptor binding domain (Fig. 5) . MHC-I coverage is calculated by the 9mer with the highest MHC-I coverage for each epitope (highlighted in orange). All candidates are likely to be presented by both MHC-I and MHC-II. \"SARS\" under the antibody column indicates that one or more SARS homolog of this peptide is a known B-cell epitope.

All mutations are distant from the S protein RBD, and one mutation (S247R) occurs near one of the predicted 218 minor antibody binding site (residue 246-257).\n\nIn summary, we observed major structural and B-cell epi- From an economic perspective, the development of coro-295 navirus vaccines faces significant financial hurdles as most 296 such viruses do not cause endemic infections. After an epi-297 demic episode (e.g. SARS) there is little financial incentive 298 for private companies to develop vaccines against a specific 299 strain of virus (2, 8, 10). To address these incentive issues, 300 governments might provide greater funding support to create 301 vaccines against past and future outbreaks.\n\nOur pipeline provides a framework to identify strong 303 epitope-based vaccine candidates and might be applied against 304 any unknown pathogens. We were able to model structures 305 of 2019-nCoV spike protein as soon as the DNA sequence be-306 came available, and the modeled structure has high similarity 307 with later solved crystal structures (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ). 308 This suggests the researchers can rely on homology remodeling 309 when emerging pathogens first appear if the new pathogen 310 shares high sequence similarity with an existing pathogen.\n\nPrevious animal studies show antigens with high MHC pre-312 sentation scores are more likely to elicit strong T-cell responses, 313 but the correlation between these responses and vaccine ef-314 ficacy is relatively weak (7, 14, 43). When combined with 315 future clinical data, our work can help the field untangle the 316 relationship between antigen presentation and vaccine efficacy. 317\n\nWe obtained 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2019) and SARS-CoV ref-319 erence sequence data from NCBI GeneBank (NC_045512 and 320 NC_004718) (4, 16). We obtained viral sequences associated with 321 68 patients from GISAID on Feb 1st 2020. 322 We broke each gene sequence in 2019-nCoV into sliding windows 323 and used NetMHCpan4 (17) and MARIA (15) to predict MHC-I 324 and MHC-II presentation scores across 32 MHC alleles common 325 in the Chinese population (41) . We marked a peptide sequence as 326 covered by MHC-I and MHC-II if it is presented by more then 33% 327 of constituent alleles. For validation, we applied our methodology 328 to known SARS T-cell epitopes and non-epitopes.
