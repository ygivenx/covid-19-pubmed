{"title": "Job satisfaction and its related factors: A questionnaire survey of hospital nurses in Mainland China", "body": "What is already known about the topic?\n\nThe current worldwide shortage of nurses is of great concern and job satisfaction among nurses has been identified as a key factor in nurses' recruitment and retention.\n\nSeveral major factors are associated with job satisfaction of nurses, such as organizational commitment, occupational stress, professional commitment, role conflict and role ambiguity.\n\nMuch research has been conducted on nurses' job satisfaction and related factors in western countries and some Asian countries. \n\nThe widespread nursing shortage and nurses' high turnover has become a global issue (Kingma, 2001) . The nursing workforce in Mainland China also faces similar challenges in recruitment and retention as a consequence of China entering the World Trade Organization, which has opened their labour market. Job mobility has also been fuelled by more relaxed immigration policies which has meant an increase in the number of Chinese nurses being recruited to western countries where salaries and opportunities are better (Ho, 1995) . Recruitment and retention of nurses are persistent problems associated with job satisfaction. There is an urgent need for rigorous research regarding job satisfaction and related factors to inform the development of good nurse employment strategies in Mainland China.\n\nJob satisfaction is defined as all the feelings that an individual has about his/her job (Spector, 1997) . Researchers have attempted to identify the various components of job satisfaction, measure the relative importance of each component of job satisfaction and examine what effects these components have on workers' productivity (Lu et al., 2005) .\n\nA range of findings derived from quantitative as well as qualitative studies has been reported in the literature regarding sources of job satisfaction among nurses. These sources include working conditions (Adamson et al., 1995; Nolan et al., 1995) , interactions with patients/co-workers/managers (Lee, 1998; Aiken et al., 2001) , work itself (Lundh, 1999; Adams and Bond, 2000) , remuneration (Price, 2002; Wang, 2002) , selfgrowth and promotion (Tzeng, 2002a, b) , praise and recognition (Nolan et al., 1995; Lundh, 1999) , control and responsibility (Lee, 1998; Price, 2002) , job security (Nolan et al., 1995 (Nolan et al., , 1998 and leadership styles and organizational policies (Lee, 1998; Tzeng, 2002a, b) .\n\nJob satisfaction among nurses has been identified as a key factor in nurses' turnover with the empirical literature suggesting that it is related to a number of organizational, professional and personal variables (Lu et al., 2005) . Organizational commitment refers to identification with and loyalty to the organization and its goals (Blau and Boal, 1987) . Organizational commitment has been found to be positively related to job satisfaction of hospital nurses (Blegen, 1993; Al-Aameri, 2000) and could explain 41% of the variance in job satisfaction (Knoop, 1995) .\n\nProfessional commitment is a person's involvement, pledge, promise or resolution towards his/her profession (Fang, 2001) . It has an incremental effect on a person's intention to leave the organization (Blau and Lunz, 1998) and is positively associated with the job satisfaction of nurses (Lu et al., 2000; Jones, 2000) .\n\nOccupational stress has also been found to be a major factor related to the job satisfaction of nurses (Blegen, 1993) as well as role conflict and role ambiguity (Tovey and Adams, 1999) . Role conflict occurs as the nurse attempts to satisfy a number of incompatible demands arising from other people's expectations of his/her role (Rosse and Rosse, 1981) . Inadequate or confused information about what work the nurse should cover, the limits of the role and other people's expectations of how the nurse's role fits in with their expectations produce role ambiguity (Hingley and Cooper, 1986 ).\n\nWith ongoing economic reform, China has made some major policy changes in health care. The government has liberalized the private ownership of health facilities and private clinical practices and public hospitals have been partially freed from strict governmental labour market controls (Ho, 1995; Hsiao, 1995) . Job mobility has become a reality and pressures are building for higher rewards for the country's health care professional workforce (Ho, 1995) . Additionally, nursing model reforms have impacted on the delivery of health care. The patient-centred holistic nursing care model has gradually replaced the traditional disease-centred nursing care model. However, primary nursing has only been introduced in leading hospitals because of the nurse shortage and a lack of appropriate knowledge and skills in the nursing workforce (Ministry of Health, China, 2003) .\n\nThese developments have coincided with a growing recognition of the professional status of nurses. In the 1980s, the Government reaffirmed that like medicine nursing was an independent profession that required well-qualified personnel with nurses being awarded a protected title by the National Ministry of Health (Li, 2001) . At present, there are three levels of basic nursing education in Mainland China: diploma programmes delivered by health schools, associate degree programmes mainly provided by colleges of nursing and bachelor degrees through university-based education.\n\nA nursing shortage has been reported in Mainland China for many years, but in recent years it has become greater. According to the Ministry of Health, China (2003) , the number of registered nurses was 10:10,000 of the population 1997-2002. Further, the turnover of nurses with an associate degree or a bachelor degree is more serious than that of nurses with a diploma (Wu, 1999) . It suggests that Mainland China needs to increase the number of nurses, especially well-educated nurses, however, the increased mobility of the nursing workforce is exacerbating the situation and highlights the need to identify factors which contribute to nurses' turnover (Lu et al., 2005) .\n\nWhile the literature indicates common issues across the world, it is possible that different issues have greater significance in different countries due to the social context of particular labour markets. The current shortage of nurses in Mainland China highlights the importance of understanding nurses' job satisfaction and related factors so that health care organizations can implement effective interventions to improve the retention of their nursing workforce. The little available research has significant methodological limitations and no research which directly addresses the topic has been conducted in Mainland China (Yang and Cheng, 2004) . In consequence, this study addressed an important gap in the available literature.\n\nThe study aimed to explore nurses' views and experiences regarding different components of their working lives in Mainland China. The following objectives were set:\n\nTo describe job satisfaction, organizational commitment, professional commitment, occupational stress, role conflict and role ambiguity of nurses;\n\nTo compare job satisfaction, organizational commitment, professional commitment, occupational stress, role conflict and role ambiguity of nurses across the three educational programmes (diploma, associate degree and bachelor degree programmes).\n\nA cross-sectional survey design utilizing questionnaires was selected to fulfil the research objectives.\n\nA total population of 632 nurses working in the medical and surgical departments in two teaching hospitals in Beijing were surveyed. Five hundred and twelve nurses completed and returned a self-completed questionnaire representing a response rate of 81% (diploma: n \u00bc 230, a response rate of 77.4%; associate degree: n \u00bc 232, a response rate of 82.6%; bachelor degree: n \u00bc 50, a response rate of 92.6%).\n\nThe following instruments were utilized:\n\nJob Satisfaction Scale (Warr et al., 1979) : a five-point Likert type scale (1 \u00bc very dissatisfied, 5 \u00bc very satisfied) with 15 items. The coefficient alpha was 0.85-0.88 and test-retest correlation coefficient was 0.63 for 6-month period (Warr et al., 1979) . The Cronbach's alpha was 0.89 in this study. Organisational Commitment Scale (Mowday et al., 1979) : a five-point Likert type scale (1 \u00bc strongly disagree, 5 \u00bc strongly agree) with 15 items. Coefficient alphas ranged from 0.82 to 0.93 with a median of 0.90 and test-retest reliability coefficients were 0.53, 0.63 and 0.75 for 2-, 3-and 4-month periods, respectively (Mowday et al., 1979) . The Cronbach's alpha was 0.85 in this study. Nurses' Occupational Stress Scale (Hingley & Cooper, 1986 ): a five-point Likert type scale (1 \u00bc no pressure, 5 \u00bc extreme pressure) with 24 items. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.92 in this study. Professional Identification Scale (Brown et al., 1986 ): a five-point Likert type scale (1 \u00bc never, 5 \u00bc very often) with 10 items. Items analysis of the scale yielded a Cronbach's alpha of 0.71 and factor analysis yielded an oblique solution (Brown et al., 1986) . The Cronbach's alpha was 0.82 in this study. Role Conflict and Ambiguity Scale (Rizzo et al., 1970) : a five-point Likert type scale (1 \u00bc never, 5 \u00bc very often) with 14 items. Cronbach's alphas were reported 0.816-0.82 for role conflict and 0.78-0.808 for role ambiguity (Rizzo et al., 1970) . In this study the Cronbach's alphas were 0.81 and 0.85 for role conflict and ambiguity, respectively. Biographical details were collected regarding personal profile and included nursing qualifications, length of time working in current hospital and educational level.\n\nIn order to avoid the problems inherent in translation, this study used a combination of Brislin (1970) model for translating and back-translating instruments and committee approach. One bilingual expert translated the instruments from English to Chinese and a second bilingual expert back-translated blindly. A panel of three experts in the area of health care workforce management measured the face validity of the translated questionnaire.\n\nEthical approval was gained from the Peking University's Research Ethics Committee. The main ethical issues were respondents' right to self-determination, anonymity and confidentiality. The questionnaires with a participant information sheet on the nature of the study and a separate envelope were distributed to staff nurses working in medical and surgical departments in two teaching hospitals of Peking University. Completed questionnaires were recruited in sealed envelopes via a collection box places in ward offices. The questionnaire data were kept confidential and respondents were assured of their right to withdraw at any time. The names of the respondents were not recorded on the questionnaire, thus rendering the data anonymous.\n\nData were entered and processed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software, the English version 11.5. This study used descriptive statistics, w 2 -test and Kruskal-Wallis test to analyse the data.\n\nAll respondents were female and were predominately between 21 and 35 years old (n \u00bc 463, 90.4%), with half being married (n \u00bc 256, 50.0%). The majority of respondents had a diploma or associate degree (n \u00bc 230, 44.9%, n \u00bc 232, 45.3%, respectively) while less than 10.0% held a bachelor degree (n \u00bc 50, 9.8%). Slightly more respondents worked in medical wards (n \u00bc 272, 53.1%) compared with surgical wards (n \u00bc 240, 46.9%). Half of respondents had worked in their current hospital for 5 years or more (n \u00bc 324, 63.3%). In addition, more than two-thirds of respondents expressed their intention to leave the current hospitals (n \u00bc 368, 71.9%), with half reporting that nursing was their first choice of career (n \u00bc 278, 54.3%).\n\nMore than half of respondents reported that a system of primary care delivery was conducted in their wards (n \u00bc 300, 58.6%) while about a quarter reported that team nursing was used (n \u00bc 127, 24.8%). The majority of respondents had individualized written nursing care plans for each patient (n \u00bc 471, 92.0%) and for common nursing care problems/nursing diagnoses (n \u00bc 438, 85.5%). Almost all respondents reported that their hospitals had clearly stated standards and policies for nursing practice (n \u00bc 506, 98.8%) while over threequarters thought that the Ministry of Health also produced such standards and policies (n \u00bc 398, 77.7%) and had regulatory power over nurses (n \u00bc 389, 76.0%).\n\nRegarding respondents' characteristics across the three educational programmes, there was a significant difference in age (po0.001). Bachelor degree nurses were oldest (mean \u00bc 32.2 years, SD \u00bc 5.5), followed by associate degree nurses (mean \u00bc 28.2 years, SD \u00bc 5.1), with diploma nurses having the lowest mean age (mean \u00bc 26.5 years, SD \u00bc 5.6). Similarly, bachelor degree nurses (mean \u00bc 11.2 years, SD \u00bc 6.3) had worked longer in current hospitals (po0.001) than associate degree or diploma nurses (mean \u00bc 8.0 years, SD \u00bc 5.6; mean \u00bc 7.0 years, SD \u00bc 5.6, respectively). Furthermore, the proportion of married nurses in the bachelor degree group (72.0%) was significantly more than that in the associate degree or diploma groups (po0.001). More than half of diploma nurses (62.2%) considered nursing as their first career choice, which was significantly higher than that of associate degree (49.1%) or bachelor degree nurses (42.0%). There was no significant difference in nurses' intention to leave across the three nursing educational programmes (p40.05) (see Table 1 ).\n\nRegarding overall job satisfaction, more than half of respondents were satisfied (n \u00bc 275, 53.7%). Most respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with their immediate manager (n \u00bc 416, 81.2%) and their fellow workers (n \u00bc 413, 80.7%). On the other hand, almost three quarters of the sample felt dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the rate of pay for nurses (n \u00bc 373, 72.9%) (see Table 2 ).\n\nAlthough nurses with a bachelor degree (mean rank \u00bc 234.92) reported a lower level of job satisfaction compared to those with an associate degree (mean rank \u00bc 259.98) or diploma (mean rank \u00bc 257.68), there was no significant difference in total job satisfaction of respondents from the different educational programmes (p40.05). However, nurses with a diploma (mean rank \u00bc 264.05) were more likely to be satisfied with their fellow workers (w 2 \u00bc 10.005, po0.01) than those with an associate degree (mean rank \u00bc 259.73) or bachelor degree (mean rank \u00bc 204.72). Regarding other items of job satisfaction, there were no significant differences across the three nursing programmes (p40.05).\n\nAlmost two-thirds of respondents reported a highlevel of organizational commitment (n \u00bc 326, 63.7%). More than two-thirds of the sample agreed or strongly agreed that they really cared about the fate of their current hospitals (n \u00bc 369, 72.1%) and reported that they were willing to put in a great deal of effort beyond that normally expected in order to help their hospitals be successful (n \u00bc 366, 71.5%). Although more than half of the respondents disagreed or strongly disagreed that it would take very little change in their present circumstances to cause them to leave their current hospitals (n \u00bc 301, 58.8%) or to decide that working for these hospitals was a definite mistake on their part (n \u00bc 297, 58.0%), more than half agreed or strongly agreed that they could just as well be working for a different hospital as long as the type of work was similar (n \u00bc 271, 52.9%) (see Table 3 ). There were no significant differences in total organizational commitment (p40.05) although nurses with a bachelor degree reported a lower level (mean rank \u00bc 242.46) compared to those with an associate degree (mean rank \u00bc 260.51) or diploma (mean rank \u00bc 255.51). However, diploma nurses (mean rank \u00bc 272.87) were more likely to agree that they would accept almost any type of job assignment in order to keep working for their current hospitals (w 2 \u00bc 6.378, po0.05) than those with an associate degree (mean rank \u00bc 246.13) or bachelor degree (mean rank \u00bc 229.34). In addition, diploma nurses (mean rank \u00bc 240.40) were more likely to report that it would take very little changes in their present circumstances to cause them to leave their current hospitals (w 2 \u00bc 7.171, po0.05) compared to associate degree (mean rank \u00bc 273.23) or bachelor nurses (mean rank \u00bc 252.91). There were no significant differences in other items of organizational commitment across the three educational programmes (p40.05).\n\nJust under two-thirds of respondents reported experiencing light to moderate stress at work (n \u00bc 311, 60.8%) while one-quarter reported no to light stress (n \u00bc 124, 24.2%), followed by less than one-sixth reporting moderate to extreme stress (n \u00bc 77, 15.0%). Scores of moderate to extreme stress reported by respondents related to workload (n \u00bc 398, 77.8%), time pressures and deadlines (n \u00bc 335, 65.4%), difficult patients (n \u00bc 309, 60.4%), staff shortages (n \u00bc 308, 60.1%) and involvement with life and death situations (n \u00bc 276, 53.9%) (see Table 4 ).\n\nThere were no significant differences in total occupational stress across the three educational programmes (p40.05), although nurses with an associate degree (mean rank \u00bc 260.05) reported experiencing more stress than those with a bachelor degree (mean rank \u00bc 253.52) or diploma (mean rank \u00bc 253.57). However, bachelor degree nurses (mean rank \u00bc 292.63) were more likely to report experiencing stress regarding time pressures and deadlines (w 2 \u00bc 6.738, po0.05) than diploma (mean rank \u00bc 263.78) or associate degree nurses (mean rank \u00bc 241.50). Similarly, bachelor degree nurses (mean rank \u00bc 284.05) were more likely to report experiencing stress regarding uncertainty about the degree or area of their responsibilities (w 2 \u00bc 10.259) than associate degree In addition, regarding poor quality of supporting staff bachelor degree nurses (mean rank \u00bc 281.30) were also more likely to report experiencing stress (w 2 \u00bc 6.522, po0.05) than associate degree (mean rank \u00bc 268.10) or diploma nurses (mean rank \u00bc 239.41). However, bachelor degree nurses (mean rank \u00bc 189.45) were less likely to report experiencing stress regarding security of employment (w 2 \u00bc 17.889, po0.001) than associate degree (mean rank \u00bc 248.08) or diploma nurses (mean rank \u00bc 279.57). Regarding other aspects of stress, there were no significant differences across the three programmes (p40.05).\n\nMost respondents reported a high-level of professional commitment (n \u00bc 440, 85.9%). The majority of respondents reported that they never or seldom: tried to hide belonging to the nursing profession (n \u00bc 466, 91.0%), were annoyed to say that they were members of the nursing profession (n \u00bc 416, 81.3%) or criticized the nursing profession (n \u00bc 398, 77.8%). However, only one-third reported that they were glad to belong to the nursing profession often or very often (n \u00bc 167, 32.6%) (see Table 5 ).\n\nNurses with a bachelor degree (mean rank \u00bc 204.30) reported a lower level of professional commitment (w 2 \u00bc 8.323, po0.05) compared to those with an associate degree (mean rank \u00bc 254.03) or diploma (mean rank \u00bc 270.33). Bachelor degree nurses (mean rank \u00bc 190.11) were more likely to criticize the nursing profession (w 2 \u00bc 12.788, po0.01) than associate degree (mean rank \u00bc 262.76) or diploma nurses (mean rank \u00bc 264.62). In contrast, diploma nurses (mean rank \u00bc 268.27) were more likely to be glad to belong to the profession (w 2 \u00bc 7.765, po0.05) than associate degree (mean rank \u00bc 255.57) or bachelor degree nurses (mean rank \u00bc 206.69). There were no other significant differences relating to other items of professional commitment across the three programmes (p40.05).\n\nThe majority of respondents reported a low-level of role conflict and role ambiguity (n \u00bc 482, 94.1%; n \u00bc 461, 90.0%, respectively). More than three-quarters of respondents never or seldom had to 'buck' a rule or policy in order to carry out an assignment (n \u00bc 439, 85.7%), had worked with two or more groups who operated quite differently (n \u00bc 391, 76.4%) or received incompatible requests from two or more people (n \u00bc 380, 74.2%). Almost four-fifths of respondents Table 6 ). Nurses with a bachelor degree (mean rank \u00bc 298.81) reported greater role conflict (w 2 \u00bc 6.174, po0.05) compared to those with an associate degree (mean rank \u00bc 260.63) or diploma (mean rank \u00bc 243.13). There were no significant differences in role ambiguity across the three programmes (p40.05). Bachelor degree nurses (mean rank \u00bc 286.26) were more like to report receiving incompatible requests from two or more people (w 2 \u00bc 6.568, po0.05) than associate degree (mean rank \u00bc 266.22) or diploma nurses (mean rank \u00bc 240.22). Bachelor degree nurses (mean rank \u00bc 294.57) were also more likely to report doing things that were likely to be accepted by one person and not accepted by others (w 2 \u00bc 7.591, po0.05) than associate degree (mean rank \u00bc 263.82) or diploma nurses (mean rank \u00bc 240.84).\n\nIn addition, bachelor nurses (mean rank \u00bc 307.08) were more likely to report receiving an assignment without adequate resources and materials to execute it (w 2 \u00bc 10.810, io0.01) than associate degree (mean rank \u00bc 263.41) or diploma nurses (mean rank \u00bc 238.54). Regarding other items of role conflict and role ambiguity, there were no differences across the three programmes (p40.05).\n\nThe sample in this local questionnaire survey was limited to nurses working in teaching hospitals in Beijing. Thus, the generalization of the findings needs to be treated with caution.\n\nIn contrast to Wang's (2002) survey of nurses working in a hospital in Beijing where nurses reported more dissatisfaction than satisfaction, the study found that more than half of respondents were satisfied with their jobs (n \u00bc 275, 53.7%). Interestingly, this study's findings are similar to those of other studies of the job satisfaction of nurses in the USA (Blau and Lunz, 1998; Aiken et al., 2001) , the UK (Price, 2002) , Singapore (Fang, 2001) , Hong Kong (Siu, 2002) and Taiwan (Lu et al., 2002; Tzeng, 2002a) despite the health care systems being very different from that of Mainland China. A possible explanation for such similarity may lie with changes in the labour market in Mainland China, which has become more open during the last 5 years and increasingly similar to that in western countries. An open labour market has brought new pressures and challenges for hospital managers. Nurses' job satisfaction has received increasing attention and enhancing nurse job satisfaction has been emphasized as a major strategy to recruit and retain qualified nurses (Sun et al., 2001; Bao et al., 2004) .\n\nIt is also possible that the development of nursing, particularly the adoption of the patient-centred primary nursing care model has had an effect on nurses' job satisfaction (Bond et al., 1990; Thomas and Bond, 1991) . In Mainland China primary nursing has experienced more than 10-years of development mainly in leading hospitals (Ye et al., 1999) , which include the data collection sites in the study.\n\nThe findings of nurses' strong organizational commitment in the study is inconsistent with Knoop's (1995) survey in Canada, which found that nurses had a low level of organizational commitment. However, most of the study's respondents expressed their intention to leave their current hospitals. Such ambivalent findings might be explained by the influence of culture. Glazer et al. (2004) have suggested that people's understanding of organizational commitment could be affected by their national culture. Chang (1999) further pointed out that employees in Asian countries are more likely than employees in Western countries to expect job security from their employers as part of their psychological contract of employment. These employees, in turn, are more committed when they feel that their employers have fulfilled this commitment. Therefore, nurses' high level of commitment to their hospitals does not remove the potential of turnover. Indeed, organizational commitment due to the communal nature of a culture may not contribute to nurses' retention, as nurses are encouraged to build up an equally strong commitment to their new organization following a job change.\n\nTwo-thirds of respondents reported slight to moderate pressure relating to occupational stress (n \u00bc 311, 60.8%), which is similar to the findings in Dailey's (1990) study in the USA and Fang's (2001) study in Singapore. Cox (1987) suggested that stress resides in the person's perception of the balance or transaction between the demands on him/her and his/her ability to cope with these. Thus occupational stress exists in people's recognition of their inability to cope with demands relating to work (Cox, 1985) and the findings suggest that the majority of the sample had the abilities to cope with the work demands placed upon them. Hingley and Cooper (1986) pointed out that for all individuals competence is a primary need at work, with incompetence being a major source of job stress due to its thwarting the individual to perform effectively or to feel effective. Nurses' improved professional competence might therefore be associated with their lower occupational stress. In this study, some characteristics of the respondents including age, length of working time and educational level may be a proxy of their higher professional competence. For example, half of respondents had worked in their current hospital for 5 years or more (n \u00bc 324, 63.3%). In general, they were proficient in nursing techniques and skills and were able to resolve problems independently at work. Further, most respondents were 35 years old or younger (n \u00bc 473, 92.4%) and half had an associate degree or bachelor degree (n \u00bc 282, 55.1%). Therefore, it is possible that they had abilities to cope with new situations and technology.\n\nAnother possible explanation lies with respondents' good interpersonal relationships at work. For example, most respondents reported that they were satisfied or very satisfied with their fellow workers (n \u00bc 413, 80.7%) and immediate manager (n \u00bc 416, 81.2%). The nature and quality of relationships at work has been identified as a major source of occupational stress (Greenburg, 1980) . Hingley and Cooper (1986) also suggested that poor relationships with colleagues and superiors are an important source of stress for nurses. This was highlighted in Bradley and Cartwright (2002) study which found that nurses who perceived more support from managers were less likely to experience job stress (r \u00bc \u00c00.12, po0.05) although the extent to which this applies to Mainland China is uncertain as no equivalent research has been published regarding Chinese nurses.\n\nRegarding the main stressors, such as workload, time pressures and deadlines and staff shortages, the findings are consistent with previous studies in China (He et al., 2001; Dai and Wang, 2002; Zhao et al., 2002) . Furthermore, nurses' workload has also been emphasized as a major work-related stressor in similar studies conducted in other countries (Aiken et al., 2001; Lambert et al., 2004; Khowaja et al., 2005) . It is possible that the current global nursing shortage might increase nurses' workload and China is not an exemption from this challenge (Gong, 1996) .\n\nThe finding of the respondents' strong commitment to the nursing profession is consistent with that in Taiwan (Lu et al., 2002) . This is possibly associated with a number of factors, including: recognition of the value of the nursing profession, increasing professional status and increasing academic professional activities.\n\nPeople can develop devotion to their profession if they think that the profession is valuable (Altschul, 1979) . Nurses, in some respects, embody the absolute moral worth of the person who gives unselfish and devoted care and in return receives a high regard in society. In Mainland China nurses are often referred to as 'White Angels' for their contributions to human health with nurses' work during the period of the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 reaffirming the value and importance of the nursing profession (Liu et al., 2004) .\n\nAdditionally, the Chinese government's recognition of nursing as an independent profession and the development of university degree nursing programmes have undoubtedly facilitated an increasing professional status (Li, 2001) . Increased academic activities such as seminars or workshops also enhance nurses' engagement in their professional roles and influence their attitude towards the nursing profession, which in turn can promote a stronger professional commitment (Lu and Chiou, 1998) .\n\nThe majority of the respondents reported a low level of role conflict and role ambiguity, which is similar to Seo et al.'s (2004) findings in South Korea, but contrasts with Dailey's (1990) study in the USA. Such findings in the study may reflect compatible demands from nurse educators, colleagues and nursing managers resulting in clear and sufficient information about working responsibilities. It is possible that the majority of respondents graduated from the same educational institution to which their hospitals were affiliated so that the nurse educators, colleagues and hospital managers of the respondents held similar values and principles regarding nurses' roles, thus reducing the potential for role conflict (Hingley and Cooper, 1986 ). In addition, in 1982, the Ministry of Health, China published 'Working Responsibilities of Health Care Personnel in Hospitals' which set out the working roles of staff nurses, health care assistants, doctors and other health care personnel. Although some reforms in nursing have occurred, this guide has not been modified and has been widely implemented in hospitals across Mainland China so that the opportunities for role overlap and conflict may been minimized in consequence.\n\nThe findings of significant differences in nurses' role conflict and professional commitment across the three educational programmes (diploma, associate degree and bachelor degree) suggest primary differences arising from the impact of education (po0.05). Such findings may be explained by the bachelor degree nurses' higher role expectations. The knowledge enrichment of the university-educated nurses may yield a broader perspective and a higher expectation of their working roles compared to that of diploma and associate degree nurses (Wetzel et al., 1989) . However, the bachelor degree nurses' role perception is not dominant in a nursing workforce as they only represent a minority with about 5% of registered nurses in 2002 having a bachelor degree in China (Jiang et al., 2004) . This study found even in the teaching hospitals in Beijing, as the highest health care institutes, less than 10% of nurses had a bachelor degree. Additionally, in hospitals, the bachelor degree staff nurses assume the same roles and tasks as those with a diploma or associate degree (Yang and Cheng, 2004) , which may increase the bachelor degree nurses' role conflict arising from the different role expectations and task requirements from universities, hospitals, peers and themselves.\n\nThe bachelor degree nurses' weaker professional commitment is similar to Lu and Chen's (1999) local survey. One possible explanation is that well-educated nurses are more likely to experience the conflict between their role expectations and actual working roles. Indeed, Jing (2000) has suggested that such a conflict could result in bachelor degree nurses not feeling that they belong to the nursing profession.\n\nAnother possible explanation is that the bachelor degree nurses may have a stronger intention to leave the nursing profession. Bartlett et al. (1999) found that graduates were less confident in their initial decision to enter the nursing profession compared with diplomats. Similarly, Lu and Chen (1999) found that half of nursing undergraduates disliked or strongly disliked the nursing profession with most of them reporting that they intended to change to another career.\n\nThe findings indicate that there were no significant differences in total job satisfaction of nurses across the three educational programmes (p40.05). This finding is inconsistent with previous studies, which found that nurses with a higher educational level were less likely to be satisfied with their job (Lu et al., 2002; Chu et al., 2003) .\n\nPart of the explanation for this finding may rest with the interrelationships between age, working years, marital status and job satisfaction. For example, Blegen's (1993) meta-analysis found that nurses who were older and had longer working experiences were more likely to be satisfied with their job. Yin and Yang (2002) also found that married nurses were more satisfied with their job than those who were unmarried. In this study, nurses with a bachelor degree were significantly older and had more working experience than nurses with a diploma or associate degree (po0.001). Additionally, most of the nurses with a bachelor degree were married (po0.001). It is possible that these respondent characteristics had an impact on the relationship between job satisfaction and educational level.\n\nThe findings indicate that there were no significant differences in organizational commitment, occupational stress and role ambiguity across the three educational programmes (p40.05). This may be the result of the limited sample size of bachelor degree nurses (n \u00bc 50) so that further research with a larger sample with different educational background is needed to explore these issues. Another possibility is that regardless educational level, the staff nurses in the study assumed similar roles and responsibilities, which were clearly described in hospital guideline. In these circumstances a significant difference in nurses' role ambiguity across the three educational programmes would not be expected.\n\nThe findings in the study indicate that the hospital nurses in this study had a positive feeling towards their working lives in Mainland China. This may be a reflection of the developments in the health care system and nursing profession. But it is worthwhile to note that nurses' intention to leave is still a serious problem and warrants more attention. International migration of nurses has increased as nurses pursue opportunities for improved pay and opportunities in the wake of global liberalization of trade spurred on by developed countries increasing their international recruitment to meet their health care workforce needs and in doing so creating a 'skills drain' in many developing countries (Kingma, 2001) . One might expect to observe dissatisfaction with changes in education with the influence of American curricula and higher education and limited changes to the nurse's role in the guideline established by the Ministry of Health, China, but it is likely that those experiencing greatest dissonance between the expectations and reality of their role will have entered the global labour market and such individuals would not have been recruited to this study. Further research is needed to test the impact of educational level upon job satisfaction, occupational commitment, occupational stress and role ambiguity using other samples.\n\nThe study also indicates that the bachelor degree nurses had weaker professional commitment and a higher level of role conflict. It is suggested that nurses' educational background should be considered an important factor in understanding nurses' working lives and may indicate the need for a clinical career ladder for nursing staff in Mainland China. Such a ladder, which uses a grading structure to facilitate career progression by defining different levels of clinical and professional practice in nursing, has been successfully introduced in other countries such as the UK (Buchan, 1999) . Further, Krugman et al.'s (2000) work in the USA found that the use of a clinical ladder facilitated nurses' professional development, strengthened their organizational commitment and increased their job satisfaction in a study evaluating 10 years of progressive change."}
