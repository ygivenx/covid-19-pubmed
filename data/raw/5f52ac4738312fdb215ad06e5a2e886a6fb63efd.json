{"title": "SUP PLE MEN TAL MAT ERI AL", "body": ". Biallelic mutations using CRI SPR-Cas9 in RAW cells. Electropherograms of WT versus biallelic mutants in RAW cells for genes (A) Cpb1, (B) C3aR, and (C) C3. Figure S2 . C3aR \u2212/\u2212 and C3 \u2212/\u2212 BMDMs harbor a WT copy of caspase-11. Caspase-11 from WT, C3aR-deficient (C3aR \u2212/\u2212 ), and C3-deficient (C3 \u2212/\u2212 ) BMDMs was sequenced and analyzed for the presence or absence of a 5-bp deletion found in Sv129 mice (sequence underlined).
