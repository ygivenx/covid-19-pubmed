Comparison of kinetic parameters with z-RLRGG-AMC substrates\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. \n\nThe MERS-PLpro gene (polyprotein residues 1482-1803) with a human rhinovirus 3C protease cleavage site at the N-terminus was prepared by codon-optimized gene synthesis (BioBasic Inc.) and cloned into a pET15b vector between NdeI and XhoI. Two liters of Rosetta2(DE3) cells containing the recombinant MERS-PLpro gene were grown to an OD 600 of 0.65 at 37 \u00b0C in LB medium. The cells were then induced with 0.5 mM IPTG for 15 hours at 25 \u00b0C. Cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (1 mg mL -1 lysozyme and protease inhibitor cocktail in buffer A: 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole, and 5 mM \u03b2mercaptoethanol). The His-tag fused MERS-PLpro was purified by a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) with a gradient of buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM Imidazole, and 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol). The pooled MERS-PLpro was then dialyzed with buffer A without imidazole and the His-tag was cleaved by 2 units mg -1 of HRV 3C protease (Novagen) overnight at 4 \u00b0C, producing a MERS-PLpro with only two extra residues (GP) at the N-terminus. Finally, MERS-PLpro was again loaded onto the HisTrap column to remove HRV protease, cleaved His-tags, and uncleaved His-tagged MERS-PLpro. MERS-PLpro was then further purified by Superdex 75 size exclusion column chromatography with a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, and 1 mM TCEP. Purified protein with approximately 95% purity was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and generated protein beads for storage at -80 \u00b0C. Two MERS-PLpro mutants (N109A and N109D) were generated by mutagenesis using Q5 \u00ae Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs). Both mutants were over-expressed and purified by the same method as the wild-type MERS-PLpro.\n\nThe SARS-PLpro gene (polyprotein residues 1541-1855) was cloned, over-expressed, and purified as previously described 1 .\n\nProtein was prepared for crystallization in 50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl and 1mM DTT at pH 8.0. \n\nCompounds 1 -6 were repurchased from Life Chemicals. Compound purity was determined by NMR, HPLC, and/or LC/MS to be \u2265 95%. Each confirmed hit compound was repurchased at least twice in separate batches and retested for its inhibitory activity.\n\nA custom 25,000 compound drug-like chemical library was constructed as previously described 2 .\n\nAll HTS hit compounds from the primary screens were cherry-picked and reanalyzed by continuous kinetic assay by hand for confirmation. For compounds that showed over 50% inhibition at 50 \u00b5M concentration in the confirmation assay, IC 50 values were determined using the same assay conditions as the primary screen. A series of increasing compound concentrations (0 to 200 \u00b5M final concentration at 2-fold serial dilution) in 100% DMSO were prepared. Then 3X (three times final concentration) compound solutions were prepared in assay buffer prior to assays. 8 \u00b5L of 3X enzyme solution was distributed into wells, and 8 \u00b5L of varying concentration of compounds (3X) were added and incubated for 5 minutes. The enzyme reaction was initiated by adding 8 \u00b5L of the substrate (3X), and its activity was continuously monitored for 6 minutes. The IC 50 values were calculated by fitting with the Hill equation (1), using Sigmaplot 12.0 where y is percent inhibition, x is inhibitor concentration, n is the slope of the concentration-response curve (Hill slope), and V max is maximal inhibition from three to four independent assays.\n\nThe enzyme omission assay was done following the same method as IC 50 determination, but without the PLpro enzyme in order to test for fluorescence signal interference from tested compounds.\n\nwhere v is the reaction rate, V max is the maximum rate of the reaction, K m is the Michaelis-Menten constant for the substrate, [S] is the substrate concentration, [I] is the inhibitor concentration, K i is the dissociation constant of the inhibitor I to the free enzyme and \u03b1K i is the dissociation constant for the inhibitor I to the ES complex. AICc values of four models were ranked, and the best fit equation for each PLpro enzyme was selected 3 .\n\nEach of the two PLpro enzymes was incubated with screened compounds at 20X the concentration of the IC 50 for each compound for 1 hour at room temperature in assay buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.01% Triton X-100 (v/v) and 1% DMSO (v/v) in a final volume of 500 \u00b5L. Control PLpro enzymes without any compound were also prepared in the same way. Then, each sample including positive control without any compound was buffer exchanged with assay buffer using a desalting column (Pierce) to remove inhibitors. Each PLpro enzyme activity was measured in the same way as IC 50 measurements before and after buffer exchange. \n\nCompounds 1 -6 were repurchased from Life Chemicals. Compound purity was determined by NMR, HPLC, and/or LC/MS to be \u2265 95%. Each confirmed hit compound was repurchased at least twice in separate batches and retested for its inhibitory activity.\n\nCompound 4 (F2124-0890) was purchased from Life Chemicals. The company provided us quality and purity control data that showed > 95% purity, which was confirmed through NMR and Mass spectra taken at UIC (shown below). 4 "}
