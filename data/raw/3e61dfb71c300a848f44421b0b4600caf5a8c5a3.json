{"title": "Prothymosin Alpha and Immune Responses: Are We Close to Potential Clinical Applications?", "body": "Biologic response modifiers (BRMs) are endogenous (ie, naturally produced in the body) or exogenous (administered together with a drug) agents that modulate immunity. BRMs regulate, among others, the type, duration, and intensity of immune responses and are characterized by pleiotropy and redundancy. The thymic polypeptide prothymosin alpha (proT\u03b1) has been incorporated in the large family of BRMs, mainly because of its modulating effects on several properties of immune effectors. Its wide distribution in cells, tissues, and organs, its broad phylogenetic dissemination and the lack of a mechanism supporting its secretion, questioned the initial characterization of proT\u03b1 as \"thymic hormone.\" Now, it is widely acknowledged that proT\u03b1 possesses an essential intracellular role related to cell survival and growth, and at the same time, extracellularly it enhances the functionalities of diverse subpopulations of the immune system. Several novel functions, beyond immunomodulation, have also been ascribed to proT\u03b1.\n\nAccumulated data suggest that its immunopotentiating activity could be therapeutically exploited in various clinical conditions associated with immunodeficiency, immunosenescence, cancer, and autoimmune diseases.\n\nHerein, we present the most prominent effects of the polypeptide, as reported by various research teams for over 30 years, propose a compiled scenario on its mode of action, and provide means, which eventually could lead to its incorporation in clinical trials as an immunostimulant/adjuvant.\n\nThe thymus had remained an enigmatic organ for centuries, as its clinical significance and true function were much disputed. Although its lymphopoietic role had been repeatedly demonstrated (Miller, 2002) , the long-prevailing opinion claimed that the thymus was a redundant organ with no immunological function. It was not until the early 1960s that Miller, Good, and their colleagues tipped the balance in favor of a crucial and central role for thymus in establishing a competent immune system (Good et al., 1962; Miller, 1961) . They were the first to show that neonatally thymectomized mice exhibited a marked deficiency of lymphocytes and impaired immune responses that were further associated with their inability to resist infections and reject histoincompatible transplants. However, even these studies could not fully elucidate the exact mechanism underlying the continued thymic control over lymphocytic function. A year later, it was unequivocally proven that the thymus is actually a gland mediating its function, at least partially, through humoral messages and not merely via cellular interactions (Aisenberg & Wilkes, 1965; Levey, Trainin, & Law, 1963) .\n\nIn the years to follow, Goldstein and his colleagues isolated and identified a series of hormonal-like agents with immune-restorative capacity (Goldstein, 2007) . These initial efforts led to the isolation of a partially purified thymic extract that could enhance in vivo the incorporation of tritiated thymidine into DNA of mouse lymph nodes, indicative of increased lymphocytic proliferation (Klein, Goldstein, & White, 1965) . With the invaluable aid of the newly developed in vitro proliferation assay, this soluble factor inducing lymphocytopoiesis was purified, characterized, and named \"thymosin\" (Goldstein, Slater, & White, 1966) . However, the major breakthrough was the isolation of thymosin fraction V (TFV), a further purified preparation with immunoregulatory activity . Using a novel and complex process that enabled its purification in large amounts (Hooper et al., 1975) , TFV's properties and activity were explored in several in vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro, TFV was shown to stimulate lymphocytes deriving from immunosuppressed humans and restore their functions to normal levels (Wara & Ammann, 1975) . Additionally, TFV enhanced murine spleen cell responses in mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs) and in mixed lymphocytetumor cultures (MLTCs; Talmadge, Uithoven, Lenz, & Chirigos, 1984) . In vivo, TFV increased the survival of neonatally thymectomized mice (Spangelo, Hall, & Goldstein, 1987) , restored graft-vs-host reactivity (Spangelo et al., 1987) , and \"corrected\" T-cell abnormalities in mice with autoimmune disease (Dauphinee, Tala, Goldstein, & White, 1974) . Interestingly, TFV also possessed direct antiproliferative properties against malignant cells, as demonstrated in vitro against murine pituitary adenocarcinoma and glioma (Spangelo, Farrimond, Pompilius, & Bowman, 2000) , and against human acute T lymphoblastic (Ho, Ma, Price, Hunstein, & HoVbrand, 1983 ) and promyelocytic leukemia cell lines (Spangelo et al., 2007) . Finally, in vivo treatment with TFV conferred resistance to Dunning (Khaw & Rule, 1973) and murine lymphoblastic leukemias (Petro & Watson, 1982) .\n\nThe immune-stimulating and restorative activities attributed to TFV triggered the need to further identify its several components. Thorough fractionation and analysis revealed that TFV consisted of at least 40 different molecules, of which 10-15 were principal and 20 or more were secondary components, and the majority of these molecules were acidic and of varying molecular weights (between 1000 and 15,000 Da). A nomenclature system based upon the isoelectric point (pI) of the peptides has resulted in TFV's subdivision into three different groups, each one identified by a Greek letter, ie, alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), and gamma (\u03b3). Thus, peptides with pIs less than 5.0 were named \u03b1-peptides, these with pIs of 5.0-7.0 were termed \u03b2-peptides, and peptides with pIs greater than 7.0 were considered \u03b3-peptides. A subscript number was used to identify the peptides from each group, indicative of the order in which they were isolated from TFV, eg, \u03b1 1 , \u03b1 2 , \u03b1 3 , etc. (Goldstein, 2007) . The first two peptides identified and fully characterized were thymosin \u03b1 1 (T\u03b1 1 ; Goldstein et al., 1966) and thymosin \u03b2 4 (T\u03b2 4 ; Low, Hu, & Goldstein, 1981) , and their immunopotentiating properties were extensively studied in the years to follow (Spangelo et al., 1987) . Subsequently, a number of \u03b1and \u03b2-peptides were isolated and sequenced from thymus and other tissues (Hannappel & Huff, 2003) . Utilizing a newly developed method that reduced the effect of proteolysis during peptide isolation, Hannappel and colleagues demonstrated that T\u03b2 4 was the major component of calf thymus extract and that T\u03b1 1 was absent or present in only trace amounts (Hannappel, Davoust, & Horecker, 1982a) . The latter observation led the investigators to hypothesize that the presence of T\u03b1 1 in TFV was the result of proteolytic cleavage of a precursor peptide. This speculation was further fueled by evidence showing that a previously isolated peptide, T\u03b2 8 , was actually the proteolytic product of a longer molecule, T\u03b2 9 (Hannappel, Davoust, & Horecker, 1982b) . In addition, the same group isolated two peptides from TFV, whose sequence strongly resembled that of T\u03b1 1 . When compared to T\u03b1 1 , one peptide lacked four amino acids at its carboxy (C)terminus and it was therefore named des-(25-28)-T\u03b1 1 , and the second had an additional seven amino acids at its C-terminus, and was given the name T\u03b1 11 (Caldarella et al., 1983) . Consequently, the search for a larger \u03b1-thymosin precursor molecule began.\n\nIn an effort to isolate the native polypeptide, Haritos and colleagues developed a radioimmunoassay based on an antibody raised against synthetic T\u03b1 1 (Haritos & Horecker, 1985) . By coupling this assay with an isolation procedure designed to minimize any proteolytic activity in cell extracts, they eventually isolated, initially from rat thymus, a polypeptide of 112 amino acids long, which contained the T\u03b1 1 sequence (amino acid residues 1-28) at its amino (N)-terminus (Haritos, Goodall, & Horecker, 1984) . They named this polypeptide proT\u03b1 to indicate that it was the source of T\u03b1 1 and T\u03b1 1 -related peptide fragments present in TFV preparations.\n\nHuman proT\u03b1 is 109 amino acids long and is encoded by the PTMA gene located on chromosome 2 (Szabo et al., 1993) . Nearly half of the total residues in proT\u03b1 are accounted by glutamic and aspartic acid and, as a result, the molecule acquires a particularly low pI 3.55. Although it was initially referred to as a \"thymic hormone,\" proT\u03b1 is not solely expressed in the thymus, but detected in all tissues (Haritos, Tsolas, & Horecker, 1984) . It is a noticeably conserved polypeptide characterized by a high degree of sequence homology among mammals (Hannappel & Huff, 2003) and overexpressed in cells with increased physiological (eg, young thymus) or abnormal (eg, malignant) proliferative capacity (Haritos, 1987) .\n\nAs proT\u03b1's acidic residues are found primarily within the central segment of the polypeptide chain, the molecule has no specific secondary structure and, eventually, adopts a random coil conformation (Gast et al., 1995) . However, the possibility that proT\u03b1 acquires a secondary structure upon interaction with other proteins has not been ruled out (Pi\u00f1eiro, Cordero, & Nogueira, 2000) . In support of this, it has been demonstrated that under specific conditions (low pH and high concentration) the polypeptide forms amyloid fibrils (Pavlov, Cherny, Heim, Jovin, & Subramaniam, 2002) . Although proT\u03b1 is released by necrotic neurons via a unique nonclassical pathway (Halder, Matsunaga, & Ueda, 2012; Matsunaga & Ueda, 2010) , the peptide lacks a signal peptide sequence required for secretion. Instead, it bears a bipartite nuclear localization signal which consists of two blocks of basic residues ( 87 KR 89 and 100 TKKQKT 105 ), and is both necessary and sufficient for import of the protein to the nucleus, where it is predominantly located (Manrow, Sburlati, Hanover, & Berger, 1991; Rubtsov et al., 1997) . In contradiction, many studies have also supported proT\u03b1's cytoplasmic localization (Sburlati, Manrow, & Berger, 1990; Tsitsiloni, Yialouris, Sekeri-Pataryas, & Haritos, 1989) . In an effort to address this antiphasis, Enkemann and coworkers demonstrated that proT\u03b1 is in principle detected at active transcription sites in the nucleus, while a smaller fraction remains in the cytoplasm (Enkemann, Wang, Trumbore, & Berger, 2000) . It was additionally suggested that, owing to its small size and its negative charge, proT\u03b1 may facilitate the movement of other positively charged molecules (eg, of histones) into and within the nucleus, particularly in highly charged environments where there is a need to overcome electrostatic interactions. In terms of proT\u03b1's biological role, a vast number of studies have attributed, among others, various and diverse immune-related properties to the polypeptide, the most important of which are analyzed later.\n\nThe potent anticancer activity of proT\u03b1 was studied in the early 1990s, when it was first reported that it regulates MHC class II expression on human and mouse antigen-presenting cells (APCs; Baxevanis et al., 1992) . The significance of this observation was verified in three serial studies in a leukemic in vivo animal model, where mice inoculated with L1210 cells and therapeutically treated with proT\u03b1, survived for over 2 months (Papanastasiou, Baxevanis, & Papamichail, 1992) . The immunological modifications caused by proT\u03b1 included the in vivo generation of MHC-restricted tumor-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs; Baxevanis, Gritzapis, Spanakos, Tsitsilonis, & Papamichail, 1995) , concomitantly with the enhancement of tumor-reactive NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Baxevanis et al., 1994) . Both effectors efficiently lysed the syngeneic L1210 tumor cells. The immunoenhancing effect of proT\u03b1 was exerted upstream lymphocyte activation via an interleukin (IL)-2-dependent manner. Most importantly, proT\u03b1 shifted antitumor-reactive immune responses toward the stimulation of the most suitable effectors, CTLs or NK cells, depending on the presence or absence of tumor-specific antigenic peptides, respectively.\n\nAnimal studies were followed by in vitro human studies in lymphocytes from cancer patients. Cancer induces severe immune dysfunctions, which are further intensified by anticancer therapies administered to patients. ProT\u03b1 was shown to restore the deficiencies of peripheral blood lymphocytes deriving from patients with advanced solid tumors by enhancing:\n\n(1) the allogeneic cell-mediated lympholysis; (2) antigen presentation, as confirmed by the increased values recorded in MLR; and (3) the reduced NK and T-cell cytotoxic activity, by regulating the levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and IL-2 (Baxevanis, Reclos, & Papamichail, 1993 ). Two consecutive studies in melanoma and colon cancer patients showed that proT\u03b1 could act beneficially at early-stage cancers, and when combined with lowdose interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 or IL-2, significantly enhanced monocyte, NK and LAK cell tumoristatic and tumorilytic activities Garbin, Eckert, B\u20ac uttner, Garbe, & Maurer, 1994) . ProT\u03b1 in conjunction with either IFN-\u03b3 or IL-2 increased the adhesion of monocytes to tumor targets and the expression of characteristic NK cell markers (eg, CD56, CD16), enhanced the lytic activity of LAK cells, in particular of CD16+CD2-cells, inhibited the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 and PGE2, and induced the production and secretion of high levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 (Cordero, Sarandeses, L\u00f3pez-Rodr\u00edguez, & Nogueira, 1995; Eckert, Gr\u20ac unberg, Garbin, & Maurer, 1997; Eckert, Gr\u20ac unberg, Immenschuh, et al., 1997; Garbin, Eckert, Immenschuh, Kreuser, & Maurer, 1997; L\u00f3pez-Rodr\u00edguez, Cordero, Sarandeses, Vi\u00f1uela, & Nogueira, 1994) . Based on the aforementioned data, the first means of action of proT\u03b1 was shaped, indicating that the polypeptide restores cancer patient lymphocyte deficiencies by selectively controlling the functions of monocytes. Monocytes, in turn, produce cytokines that generate a favorable cytokine milieu, facilitating lymphocyte activation. To optimize this effect, synergy between proT\u03b1 and low concentrations of other BRMs was assessed. For example, proT\u03b1 was combined with a monoclonal antibody to CD3 (anti-CD3), and this synergy further increased tumor cell-lysis by both MHC-and non-MHC-restricted PBMC effectors (Baxevanis et al., 1999) .\n\nAll these results were complemented by the elegant study of Voutsas et al. (2000) , where, using MLTCs, proT\u03b1 in synergy with low-dose IL-2 led to expansion of tumor-reactive CD4+ T cells and the subsequent generation of MHC class I-restricted autologous tumor-specific CTLs. This was the first study showing that in order for proT\u03b1 to fully exert its beneficial effect on CTLs, the concomitant presence of autologous CD4+ T cells and monocytes was required.\n\nCombining all previous data, in an attempt to fill in the gaps, our research team used proteomics to elucidate the mechanism of action of proT\u03b1 on healthy donor-and cancer patient-derived PBMCs. Based on proteins up-and downregulated upon PBMC treatment with proT\u03b1, we were the first to analytically describe the scenario underlying its immunoenhancing activity. We suggested that proT\u03b1 ligates innate immunity receptor(s) on APCs, leading to formation of strong APC-T-cell synapses, proinflammatory cytokine secretion and thus, the indirect increase in the cytotoxicity of CTLs, NK cells, and other effectors (Skopeliti et al., 2009) . We and others further confirmed the realism of this scenario, showing that proT\u03b1 ligates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (Mosoian et al., 2010; Omotuyi, Matsunaga, & Ueda, 2015) and matures monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs), which express costimulatory molecules (Skopeliti et al., 2009 ) and secrete proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, proT\u03b1matured DCs loaded with tumor antigens induced the polarization of T H 1-type tumor-reactive immune responses, resulting in the generation of polyfunctional highly lytic tumor antigen-specific CTLs . Besides DCs, proT\u03b1 could also activate other immune cell types expressing TLR4, eg, neutrophils to secrete \u00c1 O 2 \u00c0 and kill tumor cells in vitro , and macrophages (Mosoian et al., 2010) . Ex vivo experiments showed that proT\u03b1 significantly restored the reduced cytotoxicity of immunosuppressed ascites-derived tumorassociated lymphocytes against ovarian tumor cells and inhibited ovarian tumor growth in SCID mice inoculated with human tumors (Voutsas et al., 2013) .\n\nControl of viral replication in humans requires the involvement of robust CTL responses, which in turn demand the presence of type I IFNs, that further support CD8+ T-cell development and function (Welsh, Bahl, Marshall, & Urban, 2012) . Interestingly, proT\u03b1 has been shown to be a regulator and enhancer of type I IFN secretion and as such, its antiviral properties were investigated. Qiu and colleagues provided the first evidence of proT\u03b1's capacity to enhance IFN-\u03b1 secretion by murine macrophages (Qiu et al., 2002) . Later, proteomic analysis of human mononuclear cells treated with proT\u03b1 revealed that the polypeptide enhanced the expression of mixovirus-resistance protein 2, an IFN-\u03b1-inducible protein that possesses significant antiviral activity (Skopeliti et al., 2007) . Moreover, proT\u03b1 was identified as a potent suppressor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 replication in primary macrophages, when released by virusinfected CD8+ T cells. It was also shown that this HIV-1 inhibition occurs following viral integration, it is not virus specific (Mosoian et al., 2006) , and is rather mediated by the upregulation of type I IFNs, following activation of TLR4 by proT\u03b1 (Mosoian et al., 2010; Teixeira et al., 2015) . Similarly, release of proT\u03b1 upon infection of guinea pigs with an attenuated strain of Pichinde virus led to induction of potent antiviral immunity and consequent viral clearance (Bowick et al., 2010) . In terms of in vivo applications, proT\u03b1 has been used as a potent adjuvant for hepatitis B virus DNA vaccines, where it successfully enhanced both humoral and cellular immune responses (Jin et al., 2005) . Impressively, a most recent report showed that proT\u03b1 displays antiviral activity in other classes than mammals, specifically in fish (tongue sole) infected with megalocytivirus (Zhang & Sun, 2015) .\n\nNeuronal death, induced by stroke or trauma, occurs via both necrosis and apoptosis. While apoptosis is a more regulated process that limits the damage in the brain, necrosis tends to expand and is therefore being targeted for stroke treatment (Ueda, 2009 ). Based on this premise, in an effort to identify soluble molecules that could inhibit necrosis, Ueda and colleagues isolated and identified proT\u03b1 as a unique antineuronal necrosis factor in the conditioned medium of cortical neurons (Ueda, Fujita, Yoshida, Matsunaga, & Ueda, 2007) . In more detail, proT\u03b1 could reverse the rapid decrease in survival of cortical neurons, abolish the typical necrosis features in these cells, and switch the cell death mode from necrosis to apoptosis . Later on, proT\u03b1's potent neuroprotective functions were also demonstrated in in vivo experimentally induced cerebral and retinal ischemia Fujita, Ueda, Fujiwara, & Ueda, 2009) . As for the mechanism underlying proT\u03b1's neuroprotective role, it has been shown that the polypeptide is released via a nonclassical manner under ischemic stress conditions and its extracellular release is facilitated by its interaction with a cargo molecule, namely S100A13 (Halder et al., 2012; Matsunaga & Ueda, 2010) . Upon release, proT\u03b1 activates the TLR4-TRIF-signaling pathway, inducing the expression of neuroprotective factors (Halder, Matsunaga, Ishii, & Ueda, 2015) .\n\nGiven its neuroprotective properties, the effect of proT\u03b1 on cardiomyocytes during ischemic injury was also investigated (Cannavo et al., 2013) . In vitro treatment of cardiomyocytes with recombinant proT\u03b1 during simulated ischemia significantly decreased the apoptotic response and enhanced cell survival. Consistent with the in vitro findings, in vivo administration of proT\u03b1 following myocardial infarction successfully reduced the infarct size in mice, when compared to untreated controls, an effect that was mediated by an Akt-dependent mechanism.\n\nLi and colleagues had initially reported that proT\u03b1 transgenic mice exhibited the polycystic kidney disease phenotype, as well as emphysemalike changes in the lung (Li, Shiau, Chiou, Yo, & Wu, 2005) . Further studies by the same research group showed that proT\u03b1 enhanced the acetylation of histones and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), or inhibited the TGF-\u03b2/ Smad signaling, and thus contributed to the development of emphysema (Su et al., 2013; Su et al., 2016) . Furthermore, high levels of proT\u03b1 were positively correlated with the severity of emphysema, both in transgenic mice and in emphysema patients (Su et al., 2013) .\n\nFinally, the polypeptide's involvement in the induction of insulin resistance was investigated, as proT\u03b1 reportedly regulated some inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, features that are associated with diabetes (Su et al., 2015) . Patients with type 2 diabetes had significantly higher levels of serum proT\u03b1 compared to normal individuals and proT\u03b1 transgenic mice exhibited an insulin-resistant phenotype. Exploitation of the underlying mechanism revealed that proT\u03b1 induces insulin resistance through a TLR4-NF-\u03baB-dependent pathway.\n\nSince T\u03b1 1 was the first thymosin isolated and identified from TFV and proT\u03b1 was the natural precursor of T\u03b1 1 and other smaller \u03b1-thymosins (Haritos, Goodall, et al., 1984) , T\u03b1 1 was initially considered as the major immunoactive fragment of the polypeptide. However, data accrued in particular over the last years revealed that proT\u03b1 exerts its immunomodulating role through diverse fragments, such as the C-terminal fragment spanning residues 100-109 (Skopeliti et al., 2009) and the central, negatively charged region 50-89 (Mosoian et al., 2010) . Two points that we consider very important are: (1) when compared to its fragments, intact proT\u03b1 seems to perform better at least in most immune-based assays; and (2) different areas of the molecule seem to be responsible for proT\u03b1's diverse activities (Table 1) . \n\nProT\u03b1(1-100) Cardioprotective Cannavo et al. (2013) \n\nThe 28-amino acid-long N-terminal proT\u03b1 fragment T\u03b1 1 was reported to enhance human cell-mediated immunity and stimulate endothelial cell migration, angiogenesis, and wound healing (Malinda et al., 1998) . Being the only \u03b1-thymosin tested in man, T\u03b1 1 has been used in a broad range of clinical applications, both as a single agent and in combination with other standard treatments (eg, chemotherapeutics), showing an excellent safety profile (Romani et al., 2012) . Among other clinical cases, T\u03b1 1 has been used for treating infectious diseases including viral (chronic hepatitis B and C, AIDS), fungal (aspergillosis in bone marrow-transplanted patients) and bacterial (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) sepsis, severe lung pathologies (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and severe acute respiratory syndrome), age-related deficiencies, cancer, and as a vaccine enhancer (Camerini & Garaci, 2015) . However, despite the promising data generated so far, the clinical benefit of T\u03b1 1 administration in these specific pathologies is still disputed and needs to be verified in larger well-designed randomized clinical trials.\n\nThe C-terminal decapeptide proT\u03b1(100-109) (TKKQKTDEDD) was identified by our research team as the immunoactive area of the polypeptide and a potent lymphocyte stimulator (Skopeliti et al., 2006) . ProT\u03b1 (100-109) has been shown to stimulate PBMC proliferation and cytotoxicity and to promote the phenotypic maturation of DCs (Skopeliti et al., 2009) , and, consequently, it improved the functionality of immunogenic peptide-pulsed DCs, induced T H 1-type immune response polarization , augmented basic properties of human neutrophils , enhanced the depressed cytotoxicity of tumor-associated lymphocytes against autologous tumor cells in vitro, and retarded tumor growth in vivo (Voutsas et al., 2013) . Using as control a scrambled decapeptide with the same amino acid composition but a different primary structure, the immunoenhancing activity of proT\u03b1(100-109) was shown to be sequence-specific and comparable to that of intact proT\u03b1. Most recently, we reported that proT\u03b1(100-109) radiolabeled with (99m)Tc binds on the surface of human neutrophils via a complex involving TLR4 (Karachaliou et al., 2015) and selectively accumulates in sites of experimentally induced inflammation (C.E. Karachaliou et al., personal communication) . Based on the fact that the decapeptide proT\u03b1(100-109) is in vivo generated upon caspase cleavage of proT\u03b1 during apoptosis (Enkemann et al., 2000; Evstafieva et al., 2003) , we developed a highly sensitive and specific competitive ELISA for proT\u03b1(100-109), using high affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies . The decapeptide was quantified in the serum of healthy humans, where it was detected at very low concentrations ( 0.5 ng/mL; P. Samara et al., unpublished data), whereas higher levels were recorded in the serum of mice infected with the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes, suggesting a correlation between proT\u03b1(100-109) levels and the progress of bacterial infection.\n\nTwo more C-terminal immunomodulatory peptide fragments of proT\u03b1 have been reported. In an earlier study, our research group identified a slightly smaller segment, namely proT\u03b1(103-109), which was also effective in vitro in restoring the immune functions of PBMCs derived from cancer patients (Skopeliti et al., 2006) . Most recently, gravimetric assays and molecular dynamics simulation revealed that proT\u03b1, via its C-terminal segment (91-111) and similar to LPS, biophysically interacts in vitro with the TLR4/MD-2 complex at overlapping LPS-binding positions (Omotuyi et al., 2015) .\n\nThe research group of Mosoian introduced the synthetic peptide spanning amino acids 50-89 of proT\u03b1, designated proT\u03b1(50-89), in an attempt to comprehend how proT\u03b1 mediates its anti-HIV-1 activity and induces type I IFN production. Incubation of human macrophages and myeloid DCs with proT\u03b1 or proT\u03b1(50-89) stimulated IFN-\u03b11 and IFN-\u03b2 production, as shown by the increase in type I IFN mRNA (Mosoian et al., 2010) . Furthermore, the same research team recently reported that proT\u03b1 variants (p7 and isoB), spanning middle segment sequences of the polypeptide (amino acids 32-41, 32-49, 51-55, 56-61, and 65-71) , also induced mRNA expression of type I and type III IFNs in human macrophages, suggesting that these peptides possess strong antiviral activities, responsible for the registered suppression of HIV-1 replication in this cell type (Teixeira et al., 2015) .\n\nIn addition, Ueda and colleagues reported that a 30-amino acid middle peptide sequence of proT\u03b1 [termed P30; ] exerts substantial neuroprotective activity in vitro and in vivo and inhibits cerebral blood vessel damage caused by ischemic stress in retina and brain. The minimum neuroprotective sequence encompasses the 9-amino acid peptide 52-60 (P9), which was shown to comprise the full neuroprotective effect of proT\u03b1 in cultured cortical neurons under ischemic conditions (Halder et al., 2013) .\n\nIt has long been disputed whether a strictly intracellular, in principle nuclear molecule like proT\u03b1, could modulate immune responses and several researchers initially rejected the idea that the polypeptide could exert an extracellular role. The wide distribution of proT\u03b1 in tissues and cells strongly supported the sole implication of the polypeptide in crucial intracellular processes.\n\nIndeed, in normal cells, proT\u03b1 was shown to be important for survival and proliferation. High levels of proT\u03b1 mRNA were detected in lymphocytes (Eschenfeldt & Berger, 1986; Szabo, Ehleiter, Whittington, & Weksler, 1992) and in NIH3T3 cells stimulated to divide (Wu, Shiau, & Lin, 1997) , whereas proliferation of myeloma cells was hindered in the presence of proT\u03b1 antisense oligomers . Over the years, research on the intracellular activity of proT\u03b1 revealed its implication in: (1) gene transcription; proT\u03b1 was reported to localize in nuclear sites of active transcription, physically interact with the CREB-binding protein (CBP), bind to histone H1, and stimulate transcription (Karetsou, Kretsovali, Murphy, Tsolas, & Papamarcaki, 2002) ; (2) DNA remodeling; during proliferation proT\u03b1 increased the accessibility of micrococcal nuclease to chromatin (Gomez-Marquez & Rodriguez, 1998) ; (3) inhibition of apoptosis; proT\u03b1 was shown to bind Apaf-1 and inhibit apoptosome formation (Jiang et al., 2003) ; and (4) protection against oxidative stress; proT\u03b1 interacted with INrf2 leading to its nuclear translocation, where it mediated the degradation of Nrf2 and promoted cell survival and growth (Niture, Kaspar, Shen, & Jaiswal, 2010) (Fig. 1) .\n\nIn cancer cells, which are highly proliferative and divide constantly, increased proT\u03b1 content was also reported. High proT\u03b1 levels were detected in human colon (Mori et al., 1993) , colorectal (Zhang et al., 2014) , lung (Sasaki, Nonaka, et al., 2001) , bladder (Tsai et al., 2014) , and liver cancers (Wu, Habib, et al., 1997) ; and in neuroblastoma (Sasaki, Sato, et al., 2001) , rhabdomyosarcoma (Carey et al., 2006) , thyroid carcinomas (Kashat et al., 2010; Letsas, Vartholomatos, Tsepi, Tsatsoulis, & Frangou-Lazaridis, 2007) , pituitary tumors (Pawlikowski et al., 2014) , head and neck cancers (Tripathi et al., 2011) , gastric adenocarcinomas (Leys et al., 2007) , hepatocellular (Ha, Song, Hwang, Cho, & Park, 2015) , and urinary tract transitional cell carcinomas (Jou et al., 2009) . We and others reported that proT\u03b1 was elevated in breast tumors (Tsitsiloni et al., 1993) and tumor proT\u03b1 levels correlated with the disease outcome (Dominguez et al., Fig. 1 The intracellular role of proT\u03b1. (A) In the absence of proT\u03b1, histone H1 binds to nucleosomes and induces condensation of euchromatin to heterochromatin. ProT\u03b1 interacts with histone H1, mediates its transfer from and to chromatin, and leads to the formation of CREB-CBP-p300 complex, chromatin remodeling, and gene transcription. (B) Apoptotic stimuli induce the release of cytochrome c, which binds to Apaf-1 and forms the apoptosome. The subsequent activation of caspase 9 results in conversion of procaspase 3 to caspase 3, leading to apoptosis. ProT\u03b1 hinders binding of cytochrome c to Apaf-1, and the apoptotic cascade is inhibited. (C) Normally, the Nrf2-Keap1-Cul3-Rbx1 complex is ubiquitinated and degraded by proteasomes. Under oxidative stress, proT\u03b1 binds to the complex via Keap1, and Nrf2 is released, migrates to the nucleus, and promotes gene transcription and antioxidant enzyme production. 1993), the metastatic potential of the tumor (Tsitsilonis et al., 1998) , and the risk of recurrence and death (Magdalena, Dominguez, Loidi, & Puente, 2000) . It is worth mentioning that high proT\u03b1 levels detected in prostate cancer samples (Klimentzou et al., 2008) were shown to progressively increase as prostate tissue progressed from normal epithelium, through prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia to carcinoma, and correlated with Gleason's score (Suzuki et al., 2006) . Therefore, following the appropriate validation, proT\u03b1 tumor content and/or its serum levels may be used as a surrogate tumor biomarker for cancer development, prognosis, and follow-up.\n\nNevertheless, evidence supporting the extracellular activity of proT\u03b1 was also reported by in vivo studies in animals, which showed that proT\u03b1 can protect mice against opportunistic infections, in particular with Candida albicans (Pan et al., 1986) . Numerous in vitro studies further confirmed the extracellular role of the polypeptide. As already aforementioned, peripheral blood T cells stimulated with proT\u03b1 produced high amounts of IL-2 and increased the expression of IL-2 receptor on their surface (Baxevanis et al., 1990; Cordero et al., 1991) , while APCs and DCs activated with proT\u03b1 upregulated MHC class II and costimulatory molecules (CD11b, CD80, CD83, CD86, and CD40; Skopeliti et al., 2009) , respectively. NK and LAK cells cultured in the presence of proT\u03b1 augmented their cytotoxicity (Cordero, Sarandeses, L\u00f3pez, & Nogueira, 1992; L\u00f3pez-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 1994) , and proT\u03b1-activated neutrophils showed increased chemotaxis, produced high amounts of ROS, and became cytotoxic against cancer cell targets (Heidecke, Eckert, Schulze-Forster, & Maurer, 1997; . All these multiple immunological responses suggested that proT\u03b1 acts pleiotropically, especially in immunosuppressed environments.\n\nAt that time, it was obvious that the cytokine-like activities of proT\u03b1 would be justified if specific-binding sites (receptors?) on immune cell surface were discovered. In an initial attempt, Cordero and colleagues radiolabeled proT\u03b1 and searched for binding sites on the surface of lymphoblasts. Two binding sites, of low and high affinity, were identified (Cordero, Sarandeses, & Nogueira, 1996) . Five years later, the same researchers demonstrated, by affinity cross-linking and chromatography, the existence of three binding partners for proT\u03b1 on the membrane of PHA-activated lymphoblasts, which were associated with lipid rafts (Pi\u00f1eiro, Bego\u00f1a Bugia, Pilar Arias, Cordero, & Nogueira, 2001; Salgado, Pi\u00f1eiro, Canda-S\u00e1nchez, Lojo, & Nogueira, 2005) . However, a specific proT\u03b1 receptor was never cloned. In 2007, based on the detailed proteomic analysis of protein changes induced by proT\u03b1 on immune cells and on the upregulation of the signaling protein IRAK4, we proposed that proT\u03b1 ligates TLRs (Skopeliti et al., 2007) . In 2010, Mosoian and colleagues confirmed that proT\u03b1 ligates TLR4 and signals through both the TRIF-dependent and the MyD88 pathways for induction of IFN-\u03b2 and proinflammatory cytokines, respectively (Mosoian et al., 2010) . Most recently, proT\u03b1 was shown to bind to the TLR4/MD-2 complex and activate the TRIF-IRF3-signaling pathway downstream TLR4 (Halder et al., 2015; Omotuyi et al., 2015) .\n\nAlthough more data need to be generated to specifically define the pathways activated in response to proT\u03b1, it is more than tempting to speculate that the polypeptide probably belongs to the vague family of molecules termed damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or else \"alarmins\" (Bianchi, 2007) , and as such, can simultaneously and distinctively exert both an intracellular and an extracellular role.\n\nWith the term \"alarmins\" we practically refer to endogenous pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs), or in more detail, to multifunctional endogenous constitutively available molecules, passively released from damaged cells or rapidly secreted by stimulated leukocytes and epithelial cells following tissue destruction. Alarmins activate both innate and adaptive immune responses. Uncontrolled and excessive release of alarmins extracellularly induces concomitantly the recruitment and activation of APCs through pattern recognition receptors, such as TLRs. In the absence of such stimuli, alarmins exert their vital intracellular roles.\n\nThe alarmin family is rapidly growing and, as for now, its bestcharacterized members are high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) and some heat-shock proteins (Bianchi, 2007) . Thymosins were suggested as candidate alarmins, although, to our knowledge, direct comparison of their characteristics with known alarmins has not been performed. Herein, we compile evidence that proT\u03b1 possesses several attributes to be considered an alarmin (Table 2) . Among others and in comparison to HMGB1, proT\u03b1 is a ubiquitously expressed, nonhistone nuclear protein with a marked intracellular physiological role in regulating transcription. It is released via a nonclassical pathway upon ischemic stress, and when localized extracellularly, proT\u03b1 can recruit and activate innate immune cells, promoting inflammation and cytokine secretion, similar to HMGB1. In addition, proT\u03b1 signals through TLR4, activates leukocytes and orchestrates immune responses (Ioannou et al., 2012) . Finally, it is implicated in neuroand cardio-tissue repair, suggesting the regenerative potential of the polypeptide (Cannavo et al., 2013; Halder et al., 2012) . (Chan et al., 2012; Schiller et al., 2013; Telusma et al., 2006) ProT\u03b1 (Cannavo et al., 2013; Halder et al., 2013; Ioannou, Samara, Livaniou, Derhovanessian, & Tsitsilonis, 2012) Origin\n\nNonhistone nuclear protein Nonhistone nuclear protein \n\nTaking all the above into consideration, we propose a scenario depicting the mode of action of proT\u03b1. In normal healthy cells, proT\u03b1 is localized in the nucleus (Eschenfeldt & Berger, 1986) , albeit a fraction of it is assigned to remain in the cytoplasm (Tsitsiloni et al., 1989) . In the nucleus, proT\u03b1 regulates gene transcription (Karetsou et al., 2002) , shapes DNA remodeling, and promotes cell proliferation (Gomez-Marquez & Rodriguez, 1998) . In the cytoplasm, proT\u03b1 protects cells from apoptosis (Jiang et al., 2003) and, due to its negative charge, facilitates the transportation of molecules in the nucleus, protecting the cell from insults, eg, oxidative stress (Niture et al., 2010) . In hyperproliferative cells, like cancer cells, proT\u03b1's gene expression and protein content are increased and this contributes to uncontrolled proliferation and induction of resistance to apoptosis and oxidative stress. Cells receiving death stimuli die violently by necrosis or undergo programmed apoptotic death. During necrosis, cell swelling and membrane disruption lead to abrupt uncontrolled release of internal cell components, including proT\u03b1, which acts as alarmin, alerts cells of the innate arm of immunity expressing TLR4, and initiates immune responses (Ioannou et al., 2012) . During apoptosis, the major proportion of proT\u03b1 is transferred to the cytoplasm, where activated caspases cleave the molecule at its C-terminus, generating among other fragments, the decapeptide proT\u03b1(100-109). The negatively charged fragment proT\u03b1(1-99) remains in the cytoplasm, where most probably is degraded or, as suggested, is exposed on apoptotic cell surface where it acts as an \"eat-me\" signal (Evstafieva et al., 2003) . The decapeptide proT\u03b1(100-109), or a proportion of it, is protected from degradation as it polymerizes adopting a \u03b2-sheet conformation (Skopeliti et al., 2009 ) and, consequently, is excreted from dying cells via an unknown mechanism. In both necrosis and apoptosis, exocytosed proT\u03b1 and proT\u03b1(100-109) are sensed as DAMPs by innate immune cells and ligate TLR4 Mosoian et al., 2010) . Stimulated innate immune cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, and DCs, respond by initiating molecular signaling pathways leading to NF-\u03baB activation, chemokine, IFN, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Additionally, stimulated macrophages and neutrophils increase their phagocytosis and produce TNF-\u03b1 and \u00c1 O 2 \u00c0 , respectively (Mosoian et al., 2010; . Stimulation of APCs (DCs and monocytes) increases antigen (eg, shed from dying cancer cells) uptake and presentation through MHC class I molecules directly to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Upregulation of MHC class II expression by the thymic peptides on monocytes and DCs increases antigen presentation and their synapse with CD4+ helper T cells, which produce T H 1-type cytokines (eg, IL-2, IFN-\u03b3), providing a favorable environment for enhancing specific Fig. 2 Proposed scenario on proT\u03b1's dual role. In normal cells, proT\u03b1 regulates gene expression and cell proliferation in the nucleus. Under abnormal conditions, cells die via necrosis or apoptosis. During necrosis, cell membrane is ruptured and intact proT\u03b1 is released out of the cell. During apoptosis, proT\u03b1 is relocated to the cytoplasm and is cleaved at its C-terminus by activated caspases, and proT\u03b1(100-109) is generated. The decapeptide adopts a \u03b2-sheet conformation and is excreted. Extracellularly, both proT\u03b1 and proT\u03b1(100-109) activate innate immune cells expressing TLR4 (macrophages, neutrophils, DCs, and monocytes) and signal through the MyD88 and TRIF pathways. Cytotoxic responses are enhanced through antigen presentation with MHC class II molecules and synapsis with helper T cells which secrete T H 1-type cytokines, and/or with MHC class I molecules, leading to activation of cytotoxic effectors (NK cells and CTLs). In both cases, effector cells upregulate adhesion molecule expression (eg, CD2) and produce lytic molecules (eg, perforin), mediating cell binding and cell destruction, respectively (eg, cancer cell targets, as shown here). and nonspecific cytotoxicity. CTLs and NK cells produce lytic molecules (perforin), express adhesion molecules (CD2), secrete TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, and kill cell targets (eg, cancer cells) (Fig. 2) .\n\nProT\u03b1, although initially characterized as a thymic hormone, is a ubiquitously expressed polypeptide that exerts pleiotropic immunostimulatory adjuvant effects. Nevertheless, and despite extensive and intensive research on its mode of action, the efficacy of proT\u03b1 has not yet been tested in humans. In our opinion, the main reason stands in our lack of understanding of its dual role and in elucidating how the same molecule promotes cell proliferation and mediates immunity. This paradox is most surprising and contradictory in the case of cancer. We know that increased proT\u03b1 gene transcription correlates with carcinogenesis, whereas proT\u03b1 ligation to TLR4 promotes anticancer-reactive immune responses. In view of recent progress in elucidating the complex machinery of immune responses and the concept that the immune system responds to both pathogens (PAMPs) and danger signals (DAMPs), the adjuvant mode of action of proT\u03b1 points toward its integration in the family of alarmins. As such, under specific conditions related to danger (resulting from cell damage, destruction, or death), proT\u03b1 and/or smaller fragments of the molecule [eg, proT\u03b1(100-109)] are relocalized extracellularly, ie, at a different site than inside the cell, where they physiologically function. Innate immune cells like DCs that are programmed to sense danger respond to proT\u03b1, and the cascade of an immune response is initiated.\n\nRecent evidence additionally suggests that proT\u03b1 is a TLR agonist. At present, driving closer to optimal orchestration of the immune machinery, several TLR agonists have reached the clinical setting. We believe that proT\u03b1 has adequately proven its potent immunostimulating capacity in vitro and in animals in vivo, by generating the appropriate cytokine milieu promoting the activation of effector cells. Although it should be studied in more detail, it is also known that the polypeptide when administered in animals at relatively high concentrations does not induce toxicity or severe adverse effects. Therefore, the next step should be to test the adjuvant effectiveness of proT\u03b1 or smaller immunoactive fragments thereof in clinical studies, aiming to strengthen deficient immune responses."}
