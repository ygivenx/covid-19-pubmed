{"title": "Substrate specificity profiling of SARS-CoV-2 M pro protease provides basis for anti-COVID-19 drug design", "body": "In December 2019, a severe respiratory disease of unknown origin emerged in Wuhan,\n\nHubei province, China. [1] Symptoms of the first patients were flu-like and included fever, cough and myalgia, but with a tendency to develop a potentially fatal dyspnea and acute respiratory distress syndrome. [1b] Genetic analysis confirmed a betacoronavirus as the causing agent. The virus was initially named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), [1] [2] but shortly thereafter, it was renamed to SARS-CoV-2. [3] By March 07, 2020, the WHO had registered >100,000 cumulative cases, in 65 countries, of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with >3400 deaths. [4] Currently, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for COVID-19. Efforts are being made to characterize molecular targets, pivotal for the development of anti-coronaviral therapies. [5] The main protease (M pro , also known as 3CL pro ), is one of coronaviral nonstructural proteins (Nsp5) designated as a potential target for drug development. [6] M pro cleaves the viral polyproteins, generating twelve non-structural proteins (Nsp4-Nsp16),\n\nincluding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, Nsp12) and helicase (Nsp13). The inhibition of M pro would prevent the virus from replication and therefore constitutes one of the potential anti-coronaviral strategies. [6] [7] Due to the close phylogenetic relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, [2, 8] their main proteases share many structural and functional features. From the perspective of the design and synthesis of new M pro inhibitors, a key feature of both of the enzymes is their ability to cleave the peptide bond following Gln. The SARS-CoV M pro cleaves polyproteins within the Leu-Gln\u2193(Ser, Ala, Gly) sequence (\u2193 indicates the cleavage site), which appears to be a conserved pattern of this protease. [6a, 7, 9] The ability of peptide bond hydrolysis after Gln residues is also observed for main proteases of other coronaviruses [10] but is unknown for human enzymes. This observation, along with further studies on the M pro , can potentially lead to new broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral inhibitors with minimum side effects. [11] In the present study, we applied the HyCoSuL (Hybrid Combinatorial Substrate Library) approach to determine the full substrate specificity profile of SARS-CoV M pro and SARS-CoV-2 M pro proteases. The use of natural and a large number of unnatural amino acids with diverse chemical structures allowed an in-depth characterization of the residue preference of the binding pockets within the active sites of the proteases. The results from library screening enabled us to design and synthesize ACC-labeled substrates with improved catalytic efficiency in comparison to a substrate containing only natural amino acids.\n\nMoreover, results from our studies clearly indicate that SARS-CoV M pro and SARS-CoV-2 M pro proteases exhibit overlapping substrate specificity. This knowledge can be applied in the design of chemical compounds for effective therapy of COVID-19.\n\nTo determine the SARS-CoV M pro and SARS-CoV-2 M pro substrate preferences, we natural and over 100 unnatural amino acids, Figure 1 ). We incorporated glutamine at the P1 position, because the available crystal structures of SARS-CoV M pro revealed that only glutamine (and, at a very small number of cleavage sites, histidine) residue can occupy the S1 pocket of this enzyme. [9, 12] The imidazole of His163, located at the very bottom of the S1 proteases, which explains less stringent specificity. [11] The S2 pocket can form hydrophobic interactions with P2 residues that are not only limited to leucine. The S3 pocket of SARS M pro . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

The S4 pocket can be occupied by small residues due to crowded cavity formed by Pro168, L167 at the bottom and T190, A191 at the top wall.

Then, we measured the rate of substrate hydrolysis relevant to each protease (Figure 3) . The data clearly demonstrate that SARS-CoV M pro and SARS-CoV-2 M pro exhibit the same activity toward tested substrates. The results are consistent with the HyCoSuL screening data. The most preferred substrate, Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-ACC, is composed of the best amino acids in each position. Kinetic parameters were determined for the two best substrates (Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-ACC, Ac-Thz-Tle-Leu-Gln-ACC) and one containing the best recognized natural amino acids (Ac-Val-Lys-Leu-Gln-ACC) ( Table 1 ) toward SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Due to substrates precipitation due to high concentration needed in the assay, kinetic parameters toward SARS-CoV M pro could not be determined. Analysis of kinetic parameters revealed that these three substrates differ in the k cat value, while K M values are comparable.

In summary, we established substrate specificity profiles at the P4-P2 positions of the SARS-CoV M pro and SARS-CoV-2 M pro proteases using a combinatorial approach. Our data clearly demonstrate that these two enzymes display very similar substrate preferences.\n\nInformation provided here can be used for the design of inhibitors and activity-based probes against the SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe reagents used for solid-phase peptide synthesis were as follows: Rink Amide (RA) The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.07.981928 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nGene cloning, recombinant production of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 M pro are described elsewhere. [7, 13] Combinatorial library synthesis Synthesis of H 2 N-ACC-resin. ACC synthesis was carried out according to Maly et al. [14] To a glass reaction vessel, 1 eq (9.62 mmol, 13 g) of Rink AM resin was added and stirred gently once per 10 min in DCM for 1 h, then filtered and washed 3 times with DMF. Fmoc-group deprotection was performed using 20% piperidine in DMF (three cycles: 5, 5, and 25 min), filtered and washed with DMF each time (six times). Next, 2.5 eq of Fmoc-ACC-OH (24.05 mmol, 10.64 g) was preactivated with 2.5 eq HOBt monohydrate (24.05 mmol, 3.61 g) and 2.5 eq DICI (24.05 mmol, 3.75 mL) in DMF and the slurry was added to the resin. The reaction was shaked gently for 24 hours at room temperature. After this time, the resin was washed four times with DMF and the reaction was repeated using 1.5 eq of above reagents in order to improve the yield of ACC coupling to the resin. After 24 hours, the resin was washed with DMF and the Fmoc protecting group was removed using 20% piperidine in DMF (5, 5, and 25 min), filtered and washed with DMF (six times).\n\nFmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH (24.05 mmol, 14.69 g) with 2.5 eq HATU (24.05 mmol, 9.15 g), 2.5 eq collidine (24.05 mmol, 3.18 mL) in DMF were activated for 2 min and added to filter cannula with 1 eq (9.62 mmol) H 2 N-ACC-resin and the reaction was carried out for 24 h. Next, the resin was washed four times with DMF and the same reaction was performed again using 1.5 eq of above reagents. After four DMF washes, the Fmoc protecting group was removed using 20% piperidine in DMF (5, 5, The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.07.981928 doi: bioRxiv preprint MultiChem 48-wells synthesis apparatus (FlexChem from SciGene, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).\n\nTo each well of the reaction apparatus, 1 eq of dry H 2 N-Gln(Trt)-ACC-resin (0.059 mmol, 80 mg) was added and stirred gently for 30 minutes in DCM, and then washed four times with DMF. In separate Eppendorf tubes, 2.5 eq (0.15 mmol) Fmoc-P2-OH was preactivated with 2.5 eq HOBt (0.15 mmol, 22.5 mg) and 2.5 eq DICI (0.15 mmol, 23.55 \u03bcL) in DMF. Next, preactivated amino acids were added to wells of the apparatus containing H 2 N-Gln(Trt)-ACCresin, followed by 3 h of agitation at room temperature. Then, the reaction mixture was filtered, washed with DMF (4 times), and the ninhydrin test was carried out in order to confirm P2-amino acid coupling. Subsequently, Fmoc protecting groups were removed with the use of 20% piperidine in DMF (5, 5, and 25 min). For P3 and P4 position coupling, an isokinetic mixture for 48 portions was prepared from 18 Fmoc-protected natural amino acids (omitting cysteine; plus norleucine mimicking methionine; 19 amino acids in total). Next, 5 eq of isokinetic mixture, 5 eq HOBt (14.16 mmol, 2.13 g), and 5 eq DICI (14.16 mmol, 2.22 mL) were diluted in DMF and preactivated for 3 min. The activated isokinetic mixture was added to each of 48 wells containing 1 eq of H 2 N-P2-Gln(Trt)-ACC-resin. After 3 h of gentle agitation, the slurry was filtered off and washed with DMF (4 times). A ninhydrin test was carried out and the Fmoc protecting group was removed using 20% piperidine in DMF (5, 5, and 25 min). The same procedure was applied for the remaining compounds. The isokinetic mixture was added to prepare the P4 position in the same manner as for the P3 position. In the last step of the synthesis, N-terminus acetylation was performed; to prepare the mixture for 48 compounds, 5 eq of AcOH (14.16 mmol, 807 \u00b5L), 5 eq HBTU (14.16 mmol, 5.37 g), and 5 eq DIPEA (14.16 mmol, 2.44 mL) in ~45 mL of DMF were added to a 50-mL falcon tube. After gentle stirring for 1 min, the mixture (~800 \u00b5L) was added to each well in the reaction apparatus, containing the H 2 N-Mix-Mix-P2-Gln(Trt)-ACC-resin, followed by gentle agitation for 30 min. Next, the resin was washed six times with DMF, three times with DCM, three times with MeOH, and dried over P 2 P4 sublibraries was performed in the same manner as described above; P3 and P4 sublibraries were synthesized by coupling fixed amino-acid residues to P3 (isokinetic mixture coupled to P2 and P4) and P4 position (isokinetic mixture coupled to P2 and P3).\n\nHybrid combinatorial substrate library screening was performed using a spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices Spectramax Gemini XPS) in 384-well plates (Corning). The assay conditions were as follows: 1 \u00b5L of substrate and 49 \u00b5L of enzyme, which was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min in assay buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.3). The final substrate concentration was 100 \u00b5M and the final enzyme concentration was 1 \u00b5M SARS-CoV and 0.6 \u00b5M SARS-CoV-2 M pro , respectively.\n\nThe release of ACC was measured for 45 min (\u03bb ex = 355 nm, \u03bb em = 460 nm) and the linear part of each progress curve was used to determine the substrate hydrolysis rate. Substrate specificity profiles were established by setting the highest value of relative fluorescence unit per second (RFU/s) from each position as 100% and others were adjusted accordingly.\n\nACC-labeled substrates were synthesized on the solid support according to the solid phase peptide synthesis method described elsewhere. [15] In brief, Fmoc-ACC-OH (2.5 eq) was attached to a Rink-amide resin using HOBt (2.5 eq) and DICI (2.5 eq) in DMF as coupling reagents. Then, the Fmoc protecting group was removed using 20% piperidine in DMF (three cycles: 5, 5, and 25 min). Fmoc-Gln(Trt)-OH (2.5 eq) was coupled to the H 2 N-ACC-resin using HATU (2.5 eq) and 2,4,6-collidine (2.5 eq) in DMF. After Fmoc group removal, Fmoc-P2-OH (2.5 eq) amino acid was attached (HOBt and DICI (2.5 eq) in DMF). Amino acids in P3 and P4 positions were coupled in the same manner. The free N-terminus was acetylated using HBTU, AcOH and DIPEA in DMF (5 eq of each reagent). Then, the resin was washed five times with DMF, three times with DCM and three times with MeOH, and dried over The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.07.981928 doi: bioRxiv preprint\n\nSubstrate screening was carried out in the same manner as the library assay. Substrate concentration was 5 \u00b5M, SARS-CoV M pro was 0.3 \u00b5M and SARS-CoV-2 M pro was 0.3 \u00b5M.\n\nSubstrate hydrolysis was measured for 30 min using the following wavelengths: "}
