{"title": "", "body": "Disorders of the gastrointestinal system are extremely common in foals of all ages. A wide variety of disorders can be encountered with a broad range of etiologies. A number of diagnostic tests and procedures are available that not only help the clinician reach a correct diagnosis but may also help in monitoring disease progression.\n\nAbdominocentesis and abdominal fl uid types (Fig 4.1) Abdominocentesis can provide useful information in foals with gastrointestinal disease, particularly differentiating abdominal disease from uroperitoneum and aiding in the decision whether or not to perform an exploratory celiotomy. Ideally, abdominocentesis should be performed following ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen to identify pockets of peritoneal fl uid. peritoneal fl uid is clear to yellowish with a total protein of less than 25 g/L and less than 5 \u00d7 10 9 WBC/L. \u2022 With intestinal compromise, fl uid color will change from clear to dark yellow, orange or reddish. Turbidity, total protein and white blood cell count will increase. \u2022 With enteritis, mild to moderate increases in total protein with lesser visual changes may occur. \u2022 If peritonitis is present, fl uid will be orange-red to milky, very turbid and possibly foul-smelling. Ingesta may be observed in foals eating a solid diet in which rupture of an abdominal viscus has occurred. It is critical that the clinical condition be taken in consideration when evaluating the results. Enterocentesis can occur, and should especially be considered in cases where the severity of disease is not consistent with severe septic peritonitis. \u2022 WCC >10,000 cells/\u03bcL, protein >3 g/dL indicate peritonitis. Serum to peritoneal fl uid glucose differences of >50 mg/dL are suggestive of peritonitis. Peritoneal fl uid glucose <30 mg/dL, pH <7.3 and fi brinogen concentration >200 mg/dL are indicative of peritonitis. \u2022 Identifi cation of intracellular bacteria and degenerate neutrophils on cytological analysis of peritoneal fl uid is consistent with peritonitis. \u2022 Iatrogenic blood contamination from body wall vessels or splenic puncture can result in abnormal red coloration of normal peritoneal fl uid. \u2022 Often, the color of fl uid will change during collection. Reddish samples can be centrifuged to differentiate iatrogenic contamination or acute hemorrhage from compromised intestinal viscera.\n\nUltrasound is non-invasive, well tolerated by the foal and easily performed in the fi eld. The small size of the foal abdomen and proximity of many organs of interest makes the foal an ideal candidate for abdominal ultrasonography. Sector and linear transducers can be used and both produce high quality images. Linear transducers produce a rectangular image that is well suited for examining superfi cial structures; however, with increasing depth the image of the far fi eld is narrowed which restricts visualization of deep structures. Curved linear transducers provide wide near and far fi elds of view and the footprint size is usually intermediate.\n\nSedation is not generally required but may be necessary in certain fractious foals. Optimal image quality is obtained by clipping the hair over the area of interest or the entire ventral abdomen if required. The abdomen should then be washed and ultrasound coupling gel applied to the skin.\n\nThe stomach is located medial to the spleen in the mid to ventral abdomen between the 6th and 12th intercostal space (ICS) on the left side. The ventral wall of the stomach is in contact with the ventral abdomen up to 7 days of age. The stomach wall is hypoechoic relative to surrounding structures. In foals less than 7 days old, luminal contents are visible. In older foals the presence of gas prevents imaging of the gastric contents and at this stage the foal's stomach resembles that of an adult with a large curvilinear echo medial to the spleen and caudal to the liver.\n\nThe small intestine can be visualized in a larger area of the abdomen in young foals compared with adults. The small intestine has a hypoechoic wall and its lumen is easily observed. The duodenum is visualized between the ventral and caudal aspect of the liver and the dorsal margin of the right dorsal colon (see . It can also be seen ventral to the caudal pole of the right kidney and dorsal to the cecal base (see Fig 4. 60).\n\nThe large intestine is recognized by its larger diameter and sacculated appearance. The lumen of the large intestine is not normally visualized due to the presence of gas.\n\nThe spleen is imaged between the 7th ICS and the paralumbar fossa (PLF) on the left side and in the 9th ventral ICS on the right side in contact with the liver. The splenic vein is imaged on the medial aspect of the spleen, caudal and dorsal to the stomach in the 11th to 12th mid-ICS (see Fig 4. 59). The spleen interfaces caudally with the left kidney.\n\nThe liver can normally be seen in the cranioventral and midabdomen between the 7th and 14th ICS and dorsally in the 14th ICS on the right side of the abdomen. On the left side it can be seen between the 6th and 10th ventrolateral ICS in a larger area compared to mature animals.\n\nRadiographs are most easily taken with the foal in a standing position. Clinician preference may largely dictate whether radiography or ultrasonography is used. Radiography is most useful in contrast studies which can be used to diagnose conditions of the esophagus and duodenum, in addition to the use of barium enemas to diagnose conditions of the distal gastrointestinal tract. \n\n\u2022 Give 120 mL barium sulfate suspension orally. \u2022 Take radiographs immediately.\n\n\u2022 Withhold food for 4-12 hours depending on the age of the foal.\n\nYounger foals should be withheld for shorter periods. \u2022 Administer 5 mL/kg of a barium sulphate solution via nasogastric tube. \u2022 Take radiographs at 1, 15 and 30 minutes and then every 2 hours until the barium has passed the area of interest. \u2022 Barium should have left the stomach within 1-1 1 / 2 hours in a normal foal.\n\n\u2022 Administer 180 mL barium sulphate solution via an enema tube.\n\n\u2022 Ventrodorsal and lateral radiographs should be taken immediately.\n\nInherited / congenital conditions Congenital disorders are present at birth and may or may not be inherited. Inherited disorders may be present at birth (inherited and congenital), e.g. atresia coli, or may manifest later in life, e.g. Culicoides hypersensitivity. Congenital and inherited disorders of the gastrointestinal system are the most frequently encountered of any body system.\n\nCleft palate (palatoschisis) is an uncommon problem caused by failure of the closure of the palate during development. The most common type involves the caudal aspect of the soft palate; however the hard palate, lips and external nares may also be affected. The cause is not understood, although genetic and environmental factors may play a role.\n\n\u2022 Bilateral milky nasal discharge is usually observed shortly after nursing. Foals may cough during or after nursing, and milk may be expelled while coughing. \u2022 Aspiration pneumonia is common, and may be associated with cough, fever, increased respiratory rate, and sepsis. Lack of cough does not rule out respiratory disease in foals. \u2022 Cleft palate is not always obvious and may only be suspected in some cases in foals with recurrent or non-responsive pneumonia. \u2022 Dysphagic foals are at high risk for sepsis because passive transfer of maternal antibodies may be affected.\n\nNasal discharge after nursing and dysphagia may also occur with:\n\n\u2022 neurologic dysphagia \u2022 esophageal obstruction \u2022 primary infectious pneumonia \u2022 congenital laryngeal/pharyngeal abnormalities \u2022 severe weakness and depression. \n\n\u2022 Thorough neurological examination with particular attention to cranial nerves should be performed to rule out neurological causes of dysphagia. \u2022 In some cases, diagnosis can be made with a careful oral examination. \u2022 Endoscopy should be performed via both nares. Oral endoscopy may also be required. \u2022 Thoracic radiographs are useful to identify and characterize secondary pneumonia.\n\n\u2022 Immunoglobulin G levels should be assessed to identify failure of passive transfer of maternal antibodies.\n\n\u2022 Treatment needs to be directed at two main areas -correction of the abnormality and treatment of secondary problems such as pneumonia, sepsis and malnutrition. \u2022 Treatment of the defect involves one of a variety of surgical techniques. Dehiscence of the surgical site is a common problem. In severely compromised foals, surgery may need to be delayed while secondary problems (pneumonia, sepsis) are addressed. In these situations, feeding via a nasogastric tube or parenteral nutrition is required. \u2022 Some degree of pneumonia will almost invariably be present.\n\nBroad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is indicated. Culture and sensitivity testing of a tracheobronchial aspirate is useful. Prolonged treatment may be required in foals with severe pneumonia or lung abscesses. \u2022 A plasma transfusion is indicated if failure of passive transfer of maternal antibodies is present. Aggressive supportive care may be required in some cases. \u2022 The prognosis is better in foals with defects only involving the soft palate.\n\nParrot mouth (brachygnathia) is a common congenital abnormality characterized by disparity of the lengths of the mandible and maxilla. The mandible is shorter than the maxilla and there is no occlusal contact between the upper and lower incisors. The abnormality may be present at birth or develop over time. Males are more commonly affected.\n\nIn many, if not most cases, no clinical abnormalities will ever be evident. In some cases, problems will not be encountered until the foal begins to eat solid food. With severe defects, nursing and prehension may be impaired. Dental abnormalities from malocclusion may cause problems over time.\n\nOral examination is diagnostic and there are no differentials. Malocclusion of the incisors occurs because of misalignment of the upper and lower jaws.\n\n\u2022 In many cases, parrot mouth is more of a cosmetic defect than a true medical problem. The treatment approach is dependent on the severity of the lesion and the age. Use of a bite plate has been described to help reduce progression of the lesion in skeletally immature horses. \u2022 Surgical intervention may be required in some cases. One approach involves application of a premaxillary tension band to restrict rostral development of the maxilla as the mandible grows normally. This may be useful for moderate defects and should be performed in foals less than 6 months of age. Surgical lengthening of the mandible is also possible. \u2022 In severe cases, the malocclusion may inhibit nursing and/or prehension, particularly grazing, and the diet may need to be modifi ed to facilitate ingestion. Young foals may require feeding from a bucket. \u2022 More frequent dental care is required as the horse ages because of the malocclusion of incisors. The heritability of this condition is unknown.\n\nSow mouth (prognathia) (Fig 4. \n\nSow mouth (prognathia) is a congenital abnormality characterized by malocclusion of the premaxillary incisors because of undergrowth of the maxilla, or overgrowth of the mandible. It is usually identifi ed at, or around, the time of birth but is encountered much less frequently than brachygnathia. \n\nClinical abnormalities are not often present and sow mouth may be strictly a cosmetic defect. In some cases, nursing and prehension may be impaired.\n\nOral examination is diagnostic and again there are no differentials. Malocclusion of the incisors because of misalignment of the mandible and maxilla is obvious.\n\nTreatment is not required unless nursing or prehension is impaired. Bucket feeding of severely affected young foals may be required. Older horses may require a special diet if there are problems with prehension. Frequent dental care may be required. Affected horses may have diffi culty grazing short pastures. Surgical correction is not often indicated. Application of a mandibular tension band can be used to restrict mandibular growth while the maxilla develops normally. Mandibular reduction is very invasive and rarely indicated. A hereditary basis has not been confi rmed.\n\nDentigerous cysts, also referred to as ear teeth, aural fi stulae or heterotropic polyodontia, are congenital defects characterized by an epithelium-lined cavity containing embryonic teeth. They are most commonly located adjacent to the temporal bone, but can be found in a variety of other areas of the head. Cysts contain a seromucoid fl uid and often fi stulate. Dentigerous cysts may be recognized at any age, but are most commonly identifi ed in horses less than 3 years of age.\n\nA fi rm, non-painful swelling is typically present at the base of the ear. The mass usually enlarges over time. Bilateral cysts are uncommon but have been encountered. Other clinical abnormalities are uncommon. Serous fl uid may be discharged from a draining tract.\n\nOther common causes of a soft tissue mass in this region include: \u2022 abscess \u2022 seroma \u2022 hematoma \u2022 foreign body \u2022 sequestrum. \n\n\u2022 Aspiration of the cyst will produce a pale yellow, serous fl uid. No growth is obtained on bacterial culture unless a draining tract is present. \u2022 Ectopic dental tissue (radiodense masses) may be evident on radiographs of the area. \u2022 A contrast fi stulogram can be used to delineate the mass and any draining tracts. \u2022 Ultrasonography can be used to characterize the contents of the mass.\n\nSurgical excision is indicated. Care must be taken because of the signifi cant blood vessels and nerves in the affected area. Some ectopic teeth can be fi rmly attached and diffi cult to remove. Complete removal of the ectopic tissue is required. Without complete excision, recurrent draining tracts are likely. Prognosis following removal is very good and there is no evidence that this is a heritable condition.\n\nBoth disorders are uncommon congenital abnormalities. Atresia coli, although rare, is the most common type of intestinal atresia and may be related to vascular accidents during intestinal development. Affected foals may appear to be normal for the fi rst 24 hours of life. .14: Atresia ani in a fi lly foal. This fi lly had an external anus that was not patent. At the time the photograph was taken the anus had already been made patent by an incision. The fi lly prior to presentation had developed a rectovaginal fi stula allowing feces to be passed through the vagina. \n\n\u2022 After a normal birth and perinatal period, affected foals begin to deteriorate by approximately 24 hours of age. As feces and gas accumulate proximal to the blind-ended anus or section of colon, progressive signs of abdominal pain and distension develop. Foals may be mildly colicky at the start, with progression to intractable pain over a period of hours to a day or more. Affected foals nurse well originally, but become anorexic as pain progresses. Atresia coli is associated with more severe and earlier onset signs than atresia ani. \u2022 In some fi llies with atresia ani, development of rectovaginal fi stula will be associated with some relief of pain, depending on the amount of feces and gas that can be passed.\n\n\u2022 In cases of atresia coli in which intestinal rupture occurs, there may be a transient period of improvement, based on lessening of intra-intestinal pressure, followed by rapid deterioration within hours as septic peritonitis ensues.\n\n\u2022 The perineum should be examined for evidence of a normal anus. In some cases, the anus is absent. In others, an external anus is visible but not patent. If feces are present in or around the vulva, vaginal examination for a rectovaginal fi stula should be performed. \u2022 If an external anus is present, a blind-ended structure may be palpable within the rectum. \u2022 Proctoscopy can be used to confi rm that a palpable obstruction is indeed atresia ani. \u2022 Foals should be examined for other congenital abnormalities.\n\nRarely, deformities (or absence) of the tail or vagina may also be present.\n\n\u2022 Diagnosis is more diffi cult because the lesion is not evident grossly; meconium impaction is often suspected initially because of the failure to pass feces and progressive abdominal pain and distension. \u2022 Digital palpation per rectum: a normal rectum but no feces are present. Note foals with meconium impaction in which no feces are present will still have a small amount of feces colored mucus/fl uid and will result in staining of the glove. Foals with atresia coli will only have mucus present and there will be no fecal staining of the glove. \u2022 A blind-ended lesion may be evident with proctoscopy/ colonoscopy. \u2022 Distension of the proximal intestine may be evident radiographically. \u2022 Contrast radiographs (barium enema, barium series) can confi rm an obstruction but not necessarily atresia coli.\n\n\u2022 Exploratory laparotomy may be required for defi nitive diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 Thorough examination for other congenital problems that may accompany atresia coli (i.e. renal aplasia or hypoplasia, hydrocephalus, cerebellar dysplasia) should be performed.\n\nOther causes of progressive abdominal distension without passage of feces in a neonatal foal include:\n\n\u2022 meconium impaction \u2022 lethal white syndrome. If it is unclear whether feces have been passed, other conditions should also be considered, including:\n\n\u2022 intestinal accident \u2022 impending enteritis.\n\n\u2022 Prompt surgical correction is required, and has been successful in some cases. \u2022 The prognosis with surgery is dependent, in part, on the amount of intestine involved and whether concurrent abnormalities are present. \u2022 The prognosis is better when the anal sphincter is normal and the obstruction is only a thin, bulging layer of tissue. \u2022 Affected horses should not be bred because of the possibility of a genetic basis. At surgery there appears to be an attachment between the large and small colons despite a disparity in size. Dissection reveals that the connection is only a fi brous one and that both structures are blind-ended.\n\nThis condition should be regarded as fatal. Intestinal motility problems or failure of the anastomosis have resulted in poor outcomes in cases in which surgical correction has been attempted.\n\nAlso known as ileocolonic aganglionosis, lethal white syndrome is an inherited, congenital condition that occurs in foals that are homozygous for the lethal white gene. It is an autosomal recessive condition that means that if two carriers (heterozygotes) are bred approximately 1 in 4 of their offspring will be homozygous or affected. Heterozygotes usually have the Overo colour pattern, which is most common in American Paint horses but may also be found in Quarter horses, Pintos and Saddlebreds. White foals born to other breeds (e.g. thoroughbreds) are not affected.\n\nMost affected foals are entirely white with white irises, but some may have small areas of pigmentation on the forelock and tail. Within 4-24 hours of life, abdominal distension and pain develop. These signs are progressive and become very severe. Minimal feces are passed.\n\nOther causes of progressive abdominal pain and minimal passage of feces include: \u2022 intestinal accident \u2022 intestinal atresia \u2022 meconium impaction \u2022 impending enteritis \u2022 peritonitis.\n\n\u2022 A white foal born to an Overo-Overo mating with progressive abdominal distension and minimal fecal production is highly suggestive. This history and progression of clinical signs is typically used to make a diagnosis. \u2022 Diagnostic imaging (ultrasound, radiography) demonstrate gaseous intestinal distension. \u2022 Genetic testing can determine whether the foal is homozygous for the condition but is impractical considering the time delay.\n\nNone. This is an invariably fatal condition and affected foals should be promptly euthanized. \n\nNormally, meconium is passed within a few hours of birth. Incomplete passage of meconium can result in abdominal pain and distension in foals ranging from <1 day to 2 days of age. Meconium may be impacted anywhere from the large colon to the rectum. Colts are more commonly affected as they have a narrower pelvis than fi llies.\n\nSigns of abdominal pain, including dorsal recumbency, rolling, fl ank watching, anorexia, tail swishing, tail raising, and tenesmus are common. Foals should be clinically stable otherwise, with no evidence of cardiovascular compromise or toxemia.\n\nOther causes of abdominal pain in neonatal foals include:\n\n\u2022 impending enteritis \u2022 intestinal accident, particularly small intestinal volvulus \u2022 ileus. Abdominal distension and lack of feces can also occur with:\n\n\u2022 atresia ani \u2022 atresia coli \u2022 lethal white syndrome. \n\n\u2022 Signalment and a history of minimal or no passage of meconium is often used for a subjective diagnosis. A history of passing a small volume of meconium does not rule out meconium impaction. \u2022 Meconium is sometimes palpable on digital rectal examination. \u2022 Meconium impaction can often be visualized with abdominal radiographs. \u2022 Barium enema can be useful to identify impactions that are not convincing on survey radiographs. \u2022 Abdominal ultrasonography is useful to rule out other causes of colitis, but may not consistently confi rm an impaction. \u2022 A nasogastric tube should be passed to determine whether gastric refl ux is present. Nasogastric refl ux is uncommon with meconium impaction and is usually more indicative of a more proximal obstruction, e.g. small intestinal intussception.\n\n\u2022 In mild cases, a single enema (mild soap and water, light lube and water, commercial enema) may resolve the impaction. Concurrent administration of N-butylscopalammonium bromide (Buscopan \u00ae ) (20 mg/dl) at a dose of 0.5-0.75 cc per 50 kg IV may decrease colonic spasm and aid in passage of the meconium. Low-level exercise (paddock turnout) may also aid passage of the meconium following the administration of an enema. \u2022 Irritating solutions should not be used and repeated administration of commercial enemas should be avoided because of possible phosphate toxicity. \u2022 If there is poor response to a routine enema, an acetylcysteine enema (250 mL 4% acetylcysteine) is indicated. N-butylscopal- ammonium bromide is used by the editors to decrease colonic spasm and thereby allow the enema to work more effectively. The solution is administered via gravity fl ow through a Foley catheter. The catheter is then clamped and left in place for 10-15 minutes after which time it is removed. Sedation with butorphanol and/or torbugesic (see Appendix 5) is also useful as it not only facilitates passage of the enema but also provides analgesia. If the initial acetylcysteine is unsuccessful a second treatment can be attempted after 1 hour. \u2022 Concurrently, water or mineral oil can be given via nasogastric tube. \u2022 If nursing is restricted, fl uid and nutritional support may be required.\n\n\u2022 Conservative over-hydration with intravenous fl uids may also be useful in cases that are refractory to initial treatment. \u2022 If there is no gastric refl ux and a surgical lesion is not suspected, allowing the foal to nurse may be useful to help stimulate intestinal motility. \u2022 Occasionally, surgical intervention is required because of severity of pain or poor response to medical treatment. At surgery, saline can be injected into the affected area and the bowel massaged to relieve the impaction without need of an enterotomy.\n\nMegaesophagus is a rare condition characterized by chronic dilation of the esophagus. There are a variety of possible causes -esophageal obstruction, chronic gastroesophageal refl ux and severe gastric ulceration. Severe gastric ulceration with concurrent gastroesophageal refl ux is likely the most common cause. Primary congenital motility disturbances, either neurogenic or myogenic in origin, are extremely rare. Foals of any age can be affected.\n\nDysphagia, regurgitation, nasal discharge (often containing feed material), depression, weakness, and hypersalivation are common. Aspiration pneumonia may be present, accompanied by fever, cough, and increases in respiratory rate and effort. Colic may be present with gastric ulceration. In chronic cases, affected animals may have weight loss, ill-thrift, and poor growth.\n\nDysphagia and nasal discharge can also be present with:\n\n\u2022 cleft palate \u2022 esophageal obstruction \u2022 pharyngeal dysfunction \u2022 severe pneumonia with dysphagia caused by weakness \u2022 botulism.\n\n\u2022 Physical examination is non-specifi c.\n\n\u2022 A dilated, gas-fi lled esophagus is often evident on survey radiographs of the neck. \u2022 Contrast radiography of the esophagus can be used to confi rm esophageal dilation. Gastric emptying time can be assessed concurrently. \u2022 Barium swallow (fl uoroscopy) is important to assess esophageal motility. The esophagus will be dilated and peristaltic waves weak or absent in the affected area. \u2022 Thoracic radiographs should be taken to assess the lungs for secondary pneumonia. \u2022 Poor esophageal motility and esophageal dilation are evident endoscopically. Esophageal ulceration may be observed secondary to gastroesophageal refl ux. The stomach and duodenum should be evaluated for ulceration if possible.\n\n\u2022 A soft diet should be fed, consisting of mashes, slurries, or grass. It is important to ensure that a nutritionally balanced diet is provided. Unless grazing, foals should be fed at elbow-height. Housed foals should be prevented from eating bedding because of the possibility of esophageal obstruction. This type of management may be required for months. Ideally, radiographs, fl uoroscopy and/ or endoscopy should be repeated (and normal) prior to introduction of solid feed. \u2022 Metoclopramide (0.15 mg/kg SC q6 h) or bethanecol (0.3-0.4 mg/ kg PO q6-8 h or 0.025-0.1 mg/kg SC q6-8 h) can be administered in an attempt to increase motility in the distal esophagus, increase distal esophageal sphincter tone and decrease gastroesophageal refl ux. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is indicated if aspiration has occurred. \u2022 The prognosis is guarded, particularly with severe and chronic aspiration pneumonia, but some foals may respond fully. The prognosis is likely best in cases where megaesophagus has developed secondary to gastric ulceration, and early, appropriate treatment is provided. In some congenital cases, esophageal function will improve over time.\n\nEsophageal strictures may be congenital or acquired following esophageal injury. Congenital web strictures usually occur in the upper third of the cervical esophagus and are seen most frequently in Hafl inger ponies, although they have been reported in other breeds. Cases of acquired strictures usually have a history of severe or long-standing esophageal obstruction, esophagitis from gastroesophageal refl ux, trauma (internal or external) or esophageal surgery. Circumferential esophageal lesions are more likely to cause strictures than linear lesions. Acquired strictures may occur in the thoracic or cervical esophagus. In young foals, clinical signs of stricture may not be apparent until solid feed is ingested. \n\n\u2022 Foals with congenital strictures may present with nasal refl ux of milk shortly after birth. \u2022 Recurrent esophageal obstruction with feed is the main clinical sign in older foals with acquired strictures. With chronic recurrent obstructions, megaesophagus may develop proximal to the site of stricture. \u2022 When a stricture without obstruction is present foals can drink water and nurse normally.\n\nRecurrent esophageal obstruction may also be caused by:\n\n\u2022 megaesophagus \u2022 primary esophageal motility disorder \u2022 pica \u2022 cervical/mediastinal abscess \u2022 persistent aortic arch.\n\n\u2022 History is important for identifi cation of situations that may have led to stricture development. \u2022 Esophageal dilation may be evident proximal to the stricture on survey radiographs. \u2022 With contrast radiography, an area of narrowing of the esophagus may be identifi ed; however it may be diffi cult to differentiate stricture from peristalsis. Repeated contrast radiographs can be useful for differentiation. \u2022 Double contrast radiography can confi rm the presence of a stricture. \u2022 Endoscopic examination of the esophagus is important to visualize the stricture and identify concurrent problems (i.e. esophagitis, gastric ulceration).\n\n\u2022 The approach taken will depend on the severity of disease. In mild cases or in cases of congenital strictures dietary management may be adequate. Affected foals should be fed a soft diet consisting of mashes, slurries and/or grass. Some foals may never be able to tolerate hay or grass and must be fed a complete pelleted ration. \u2022 Bougienage has been used to dilate esophageal strictures. It should be performed as early as possible as it will be less effective in older lesions. Surgical correction is reserved for cases that cannot be managed medically or with bougienage. However surgery can only be performed on cervical lesions and complications are common with a low success rate.\n\nPharyngeal paralysis is a rare problem in foals that can have a variety of etiologies.\n\n\u2022 Pharyngeal paresis/paralysis has been seen in a number of foals with hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. \u2022 Any condition of the guttural pouch producing infl ammation can affect pharyngeal function through irritation of cranial nerves running adjacent to the pouch.\n\n\u2022 Trauma can also damage important cranial nerves. \u2022 Equine herpes virus encephalomyelitis is a rare cause of pharyngeal paralysis, as is equine protozoal myelitis, and both are very uncommon in foals. \u2022 Pharyngeal collapse or spasm has been associated with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis in Quarter horse foals. \u2022 Idiopathic pharyngeal paresis in neonatal foals has been reported.\n\n\u2022 Dysphagia is the main clinical sign and is characterized by an inability to properly propel a food bolus from the oropharynx into the esophagus. Therefore, masticated food and saliva will be present at the nares and mouth. \u2022 Aspiration pneumonia can develop secondarily. \u2022 Dehydration, weight loss, poor body condition and weakness may also develop over time. \u2022 Pharyngeal collapse can produce respiratory stridor. Exercise intolerance may be the only obvious sign in some cases. With more severe collapse, tachypnea or dyspnea may develop.\n\nOther causes of dysphagia include:\n\n\u2022 cleft palate \u2022 oral/pharyngeal trauma \u2022 retropharyngeal abscessation \u2022 esophageal obstruction \u2022 other causes of cranial nerve damage/infl ammation \u2022 botulism.\n\n\u2022 A full neurological assessment, including evaluation of cranial nerves, should be performed. \u2022 The head and neck should be carefully palpated for signs of malformation or trauma. \u2022 The oral cavity should be examined for evidence of foreign bodies, abnormal odor, dental abnormalities, feed impaction and other lesions. \u2022 Upper airway endoscopy is critical to evaluate the pharynx and larynx. Visual assessment of swallowing following spraying of a small volume of water in the pharynx is useful. \u2022 Guttural pouch endoscopy should be performed to look for guttural pouch empyema or other conditions. Samples should be collected for bacterial culture and sensitivity testing if there is any evidence of infection or infl ammation. \u2022 Radiographs of the head can be useful to identify fractures secondary to trauma. \u2022 Barium swallow (fl uoroscopy) is another method to assess mastication and swallowing. \u2022 Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP) testing should be performed in Quarter horses or horses with Quarter horse lineage. \u2022 Cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) analysis is indicated if the cause of pharyngeal paralysis has not been identifi ed. \n\n\u2022 Nutritional support via nasogastric tube, esophagostomy or parenteral nutrition is often required. \u2022 If guttural pouch infection is the cause, this should be treated with appropriate antimicrobials. Lavage of the guttural pouch is also useful if infection is present. \u2022 Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is required if aspiration pneumonia is present or aspiration has occurred. \u2022 Systemic NSAID therapy (i.e. fl unixin meglumine) is indicated in most cases. Tracheostomy may be required for emergency stabilization if dyspnea is present. \u2022 Prognosis is variable depending on the inciting cause. In neonatal foals with idiopathic pharyngeal paresis, some foals will recover fully with short-term supportive care. The prognosis is guarded in most circumstances.\n\nEsophageal obstruction (choke) is an uncommon problem in foals. Most commonly, obstruction will be the result of ingestion of bedding, hay or other feed materials. Orphaned foals or those in a poorly enriched environment may be more prone to obstruction because of the increased likelihood of exploratory eating and pica. Rarely, a congenital lesion such as vascular ring anomaly, esophageal stenosis or esophageal cyst can cause esophageal obstruction.\n\n\u2022 The most common presenting complaint is the presence of bilateral nasal discharge containing feed material. \u2022 Foals may cough while attempting to nurse and milk may stream from the nostrils after nursing. Feed material may be expelled during coughing and saliva may stream out of the mouth. \u2022 If the obstruction is causing discomfort, the affected foal may stand with head and neck extended.\n\n\u2022 Tracheal sounds are typically increased and fl uidy. Aspiration pneumonia may be present in long standing or recurrent cases, and characterized by fever, variable cough, depression, weakness and increased lung sounds.\n\nOther causes of bilateral nasal discharge include:\n\n\u2022 cleft palate in neonatal foals \u2022 pharyngeal paresis/paralysis \u2022 oral foreign body \u2022 primary pneumonia \u2022 megaesophagus \u2022 botulism.\n\n\u2022 Occasionally, an obstruction or area of pain can be detected on palpation of the jugular furrow, particularly on the left side. \u2022 A careful oral examination is important to rule out other problems.\n\nFood material may be present in the mouth. \u2022 Inability to pass a nasogastric tube down the entire length of the esophagus is highly suggestive. If a very proximal obstruction is present, it may be diffi cult to differentiate diffi culty in entering the esophagus from an obstruction. \u2022 Endoscopy of the pharynx and esophagus is diagnostic. The trachea should be evaluated to assess the degree of aspiration. \u2022 A radiodense obstruction may be evident radiographically. Barium should not be administered if an obstruction is suspected because of the potential for aspiration. Thoracic radiographs can identify concurrent aspiration pneumonia. \n\n\u2022 In some cases, restriction of feed and water for 12-24 hours may be adequate. Foals should be muzzled so that they cannot ingest any feed or bedding. Intravenous fl uid therapy is important to correct/ maintain hydration and electrolyte status, and judicious overhydration may assist with softening of obstructed material. Nutritional support, ranging from supplementation of fl uids with glucose to total parenteral nutrition, may be required depending on the duration of obstruction, age of the foal, overall health status and chosen treatment method. \u2022 Gentle attempts to move the obstruction with a nasogastric tube can be successful in some cases, but care must be taken not to traumatize the esophagus. Administration of Nbutylscopalammonium bromide (20 mg/dL) (Buscopan R ) may decrease esophageal muscle spasm thus facilitating the passage of the nasogastric tube. Water can be fl ushed gently to help break up or move the obstruction, but care must be taken to avoid excessive pressure or aspiration. Mineral oil should never be used. \u2022 A preferred approach involves placing a cuffed endotracheal tube in the esophagus, with a smaller tube inserted inside for fl ushing water. This method prevents aspiration and allows for large-volume lavage. \u2022 Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is indicated in virtually all cases because of the risk of aspiration pneumonia. \u2022 If possible, a barium swallow (fl uoroscopy) should be performed following resolution of the obstruction to assess esophageal motility. If fl uoroscopy is not available, lateral radiographs of the neck following barium administration can be useful to detect esophageal dilation or pooling of barium. Feeding of solid foods should be restricted, preferably until normal motility is evident. Solid feed should be gradually introduced, initially in the form of gruels of pelleted feed or hay cubes, followed by soaked hay or grass. \u2022 Esophageal stricture is a potential complication that is more common secondary to severe circumferential ulceration. Esophageal rupture carries a very poor prognosis. The prognosis is grave if a congenital disorder such as vascular ring anomaly is the cause because the problem may be diffi cult to diagnose and treat.\n\nGastric ulcers are common in foals, particularly those that are stressed or concurrently ill. Many foals with ulcers have no clinical signs and ulcers may be an incidental fi nding. In some cases, serious complications can develop. Foals with a history of ill-thrift, recent or ongoing disease, hospitalization, NSAID therapy, transportation, early weaning or management changes, and foals that have been orphaned, should be considered at higher risk for gastric ulcers.\n\n\u2022 Intermittent mild colic is the main clinical fi nding in those with clinical signs. \u2022 Bruxism and lying on the back are particularly common. \u2022 Diarrhea is also reported.\n\nOther causes of intermittent colic include: \u2022 pyloric stenosis \u2022 enteritis \u2022 improper diet \u2022 lactose intolerance \u2022 abdominal abscessation \u2022 gastrointestional impactions. \n\n\u2022 Gastroscopy is required for defi nitive diagnosis. Both the squamous mucosa and the glandular mucosa should be examined. Care should be taken not to over-interpret the clinical signifi cance of mild ulceration. The duodenum should be evaluated concurrently. \u2022 In some foals with duodenal ulceration, thickening of the duodenal wall may be evident via ultrasound (serosa >3.5 mm in thickness). \u2022 Bleeding ulcers are uncommon and fecal occult blood is usually not detected even if signifi cant bleeding is occurring. \u2022 The use of sucrose permeability testing as an alternative diagnostic method has not yet been reported in foals.\n\n\u2022 Pyloric stenosis should be considered in foals with chronic gastric refl ux, or weight loss, that have a history of recent or ongoing gastric ulceration.\n\n\u2022 Omeprazole suppresses gastric acid secretion and is the best-proven anti-ulcer therapy in horses. \u2022 Ranitidine is also widely used but less objective information is available. \u2022 Sulcralfate is a disaccharide (sucrose) aluminum hydroxide complex.\n\nIn acid environments sucrose is freed from the aluminum and binds to anions of damaged GI epithelial cells forming a sticky viscous gel. Other properties such as increased blood fl ow via enhanced prostaglandin synthesis and binding of epidermal growth factor have been reported. These local effects may stimulate healing and are useful in the treatment of ulceration of the glandular mucosa or severe ulceration of the non-glandular/squamous mucosa. \u2022 Stressors or other risk factors should be eliminated or reduced, if possible. \u2022 With moderate to severe ulceration, a minimum of 3-4 weeks of treatment should be provided initially. Ideally, gastroscopy is repeated following the initial treatment course. \u2022 Peritonitis from perforated gastric or duodenal ulcers is a concern;\n\nhowever clinical signs of gastric ulceration may not be present prior to perforation.\n\n\u2022 Pyloric stenosis is an uncommon but serious sequel of severe gastroduodenal ulceration. Pancreatitis and cholangiohepatitis are other uncommon secondary conditions (see Chapter 10, p 282). \u2022 Routine anti-ulcer treatment of high-risk (i.e. concurrently ill, hospitalized) foals is controversial. It is possible that gastric acid suppression could predispose foals to infectious diarrhea.\n\nPyloric stenosis is a rare condition in foals that typically develops secondary to severe gastroduodenal ulceration. Congenital stenosis may also occur.\n\nDistended stomach 13th ICS \u2022 abdominal abscess \u2022 esophagitis.\n\n\u2022 Severe gastric ulceration is usually evident endoscopically. This may be primary or secondary. Visualization of the pylorus may be diffi cult because of fl uid accumulation within the stomach. \u2022 Gastric emptying can be assessed via contrast radiography. Barium administered via nasogastric tube should be observed in the duodenum within 15 minutes, with the stomach essentially empty by 1-1 1 / 2 hours. \u2022 Ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen may be unremarkable. Gastric distension is usually observed. Thickening of the duodenum (serosa >3.5 mm) may be present if signifi cant duodenal ulceration and infl ammation are present. \u2022 Defi nitive diagnosis is made at surgery.\n\n\u2022 Medical therapy involves treatment of gastric ulceration and increasing gastric emptying. Gastric emptying can be stimulated by bethanecol or metoclopramide (see Appendix 5). \u2022 Affected foals should be fed small meals frequently. Grass, pelleted rations or slurries are preferred as passage of these materials through the pylorus is easier than hay. \u2022 Supportive therapy such as intravenous fl uids, DMSO to decrease pyloric edema, analgesics, or parenteral nutrition may be required in some cases. \u2022 Gastrojejunostomy or gastroduodenostomy may be required in severe cases. Reports of foals with long-term survival and normal growth rates following surgery are limited. In general if there is not a prompt response to medical therapy, prognosis is guarded. \n\nIntermittent colic, weight loss, ill-thrift, weakness and lethargy are common. Marked gastric distension with associated ileus and refl ux may be seen, especially in more severe cases. The volume of refl ux may be large (>10 L/day) despite appropriate prokinetic and other medical therapies. Signs of colic are variable but tend to be mild to moderate in severity.\n\nOther causes of low-grade, chronic colic and weight loss include:\n\n\u2022 gastric ulceration \u2022 duodenal ulceration \n\nDiarrhea is the most common ailment of young foals and the number one reason for veterinary visitation. Diarrhea has a broad range of etiologies with a corresponding range of prognoses. In many instances the clinical signs may appear quite similar despite differing etiologies. Treatment in many cases of diarrhea is similar, with supportive care such as fl uid therapy playing a large part in a successful outcome.\n\nDifferential diagnosis of diarrhea in foals by age group 0-10 days\n\n\u2022 Foal heat diarrhea is a physiological event associated with development of normal large bowel function; foals usually remain bright and nurse normally. \u2022 Diarrhea secondary to meconium impaction \u2022 Errors of feeding; incorrect volume or frequency, especially in orphaned foals \u2022 Other infrequent causes of diarrhea in this age group are congenital lactose intolerance, gastric ulceration and sand enteritis/colitis. \n\n\u2022 Foal heat diarrhea (normally seen up to 2 weeks of age) \u2022 Dietary induced diarrhea \u2666 errors of feeding \u2666 post enteritis lactose intolerance \u2666 dietary hypersensitivity (rare) \u2666 copper defi ciency (rare) \u2666 sand enteritis/colitis (rare)\n\n\u2022 Antibiotic associated diarrhea -most commonly seen with orally administered antibiotics but can occur with parenteral administration \u2022 Gastric ulceration. \n\nFoal heat diarrhea (Fig 4.64) Most foals experience a transient bout of diarrhea around 1 week of age, which may last 1-7 days and is usually seen at the time of the fi rst post-foaling estrus. This is a normal physiological event and is thought to be due to the development of normal large bowel function.\n\nFoal heat diarrhea is typifi ed by a bright and active foal that continues to nurse well and experiences no episodes of fever. The consistency of the diarrhea may vary from pasty to watery. The diarrhea does not usually have a strong odor.\n\nRarely foals with watery diarrhea may develop signs of dehydration necessitating fl uid therapy.\n\nShould any fever, depression, decrease in appetite or malodorous diarrhea be noted further diagnostics should be performed as there are many other causes of diarrhea in this age group.\n\nDiarrhea during or after resolution of meconium impaction is not uncommon; however it is typically mild and self-limiting with a dark brown colour. Sometimes diarrhea can be passed around an impaction. Diarrhea may develop as a result of treatments (particularly if osmotic cathartics are used), withholding of feed, or \"stress\". Effects on development of the normal intestinal microfl ora may also result in idiopathic diarrhea or predispose to infectious diarrhea.\n\nNo abnormalities other than diarrhea are usually present. Occasionally, other signs such as dehydration, abdominal pain, depression, weakness and anorexia develop.\n\n\u2022 Mild diarrhea developing during or shortly after treatment of an impaction is used for diagnosis. If no other abnormalities are present, further testing may not be indicated. \u2022 Fecal samples can be submitted for testing for enteropathogens.\n\nTreatment is usually not required and diarrhea will resolve within a few days. If signs in addition to diarrhea are present, supportive therapy and further diagnostic tests are indicated. \n\nAlso known as lactose intolerance, lactase defi ciency can develop secondary to any insult affecting the lactase-producing cells in the small intestine. Infectious enteritis is usually the inciting cause, although ischemic damage could also occur. With lactase defi ciency, lactose is not digested and passes intact into the cecum and large intestine, where it acts as a substrate for bacteria, resulting in gas production and osmotic diarrhea.\n\n\u2022 If lactase defi ciency is the sole problem, as would be the case where infectious enteritis has resolved, foals are bright and alert with chronic diarrhea. \u2022 Bloating and intermittent abdominal pain are common.\n\n\u2022 Varying degrees of depression, weakness, weight loss and dehydration may develop. \u2022 In severe cases, signs attributable to severe hypoglycemia (profound weakness, hypothermia, seizures) may ensue. \u2022 Lactase defi ciency may also occur concurrently with infectious enteritis. In these situations, most clinical signs are attributable to the primary disease process.\n\nSee pp. 101, 102.\n\n\u2022 Lactose tolerance test. Following a 4-hour fast, take a baseline blood glucose sample then administer 1 g/kg lactose as a 20% solution via nasogastric tube or bottle. Repeat blood glucose level at 30minute intervals for 3 hours. An increase in blood glucose of <2 mmol/L indicates lactase defi ciency or glucose malabsorption. To rule out glucose malabsorption, the test can be repeated using glucose instead of lactose. \u2022 Response to treatment can be supportive of a diagnosis of lactase defi ciency. \u2022 Testing for other enteropathogens is indicated as described elsewhere. \u2022 Blood glucose level should be evaluated and monitored during the treatment period in foals with clinical signs of hypoglycemia.\n\n\u2022 Supportive therapy is important. Intravenous fl uid therapy may be required in dehydrated foals. If clinically-relevant hypoglycemia is present, supplementation of intravenous fl uids with glucose may be required initially. \u2022 Any underlying disease process should be treated if possible.\n\n\u2022 Specifi c treatment involves oral administration of lactase (1500-3000 IU q4-12 h). Frequency of administration depends on the severity of disease. The duration of treatment depends on the severity of damage to lactase-producing cells and whether a disease process is ongoing. Typically, 1-2 weeks of treatment is adequate. Lactase administration can be tapered and clinical response noted to help determine when to cease supplementation. Weaning of older foals should be considered if lactase administration is problematic and the foal is clinically stable.\n\nChronic ingestion of sand can result in physical irritation of the bowel and enteritis. It is more common in certain regions and almost exclusively affects animals that spend a large percentage of time on sandy pastures, dry lots, arenas or stalls with a sand base. In these areas it is a common cause of diarrhea and colic in foals of all ages.\n\n\u2022 Diarrhea is the main presenting sign.\n\n\u2022 Colic, weight loss, intermittent pyrexia and ill-thrift may also be present. \u2022 Signs of toxemia or cardiovascular compromise that can accompany diarrhea of other etiologies are uncommon unless the intestinal mucosa has been signifi cantly damaged. \u2022 Intestinal rupture is rare, but may occur and be accompanied by signs of septic peritonitis.\n\nSee pp. 101, 102.\n\n\u2022 Sand-induced diarrhea is rarely accompanied by dehydration or signs of cardiovascular compromise. Affected foals are usually bright and nurse normally. \n\n\u2022 Mild cases may recover with minimal treatment following removal from the sand source. \u2022 In more severely affected cases supportive care, particularly intravenous fl uid therapy, may be required. Anti-infl ammatories are useful for decreasing bowel infl ammation. \u2022 While the effi cacy of bulk laxatives is controversial, psyllium (0.5-1 g/100 kg PO q6-24 h) is often used. Duration of psyllium therapy should be based on repeated fecal sand analysis and/or repeated abdominal radiographs. Intermittent psyllium treatment may be indicated in foals on high-risk farms. \u2022 Where possible management should be addressed to decrease sand exposure.\n\nFeeding errors are most commonly seen in hand-reared foals fed powdered milk. Errors may be associated with:\n\n\u2022 incorrect volume for size of foal \u2022 incorrect concentration of formula \u2022 incorrect temperature \u2022 incorrect mixing \u2022 feeding of left-over milk at next feeding.\n\nCareful attention should be given to feeding of hand-reared foals especially at a young age as many may also have experienced some degree of failure of passive transfer and thus be more susceptible to enteric infections.\n\nHand-reared foals are also more stressed and have a higher tendency to develop intestinal problems, especially gastric ulceration.\n\nOther foals may develop feed associated diarrhea associated with long periods of confi nement, separation from the mare, or abnormal dietary composition.\n\nAntibiotic-induced diarrhea is most commonly related to the administration of oral antibiotics but can be caused by parenteral administration. The antibiotics most frequently associated with this type of diarrhea are:\n\n\u2022 neomycin \u2022 lincomycin \u2022 members of the macrolide family (erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin) \u2022 chloramphenicol. Oxytetracycline and other tetracyclines are classically stated as frequently causing diarrhea and while this may be the case in many adults and older foals, it does not appear to be the case in young foals.\n\n\u2022 Diarrhea frequently occurs soon after the commencement of antibiotic treatment but in some cases may not occur until well into the course of treatment or soon after treatment has ceased. \u2022 Diarrhea is moderate to severe, with failure to withdraw the inciting cause resulting in progressively worsening diarrhea and associated clinical signs. \u2022 Foals are usually non-febrile but progression may result in signs of dehydration, cardiovascular compromise and endotoxemia.\n\nAntibiotic-induced diarrhea should be suspected in any foal that suddenly develops diarrhea while on antibiotic treatment, especially if the original reason for antibiotic treatment was not related to the gastrointestinal tract, e.g. foal being treated for R. equi pneumonia that suddenly develops diarrhea. Other causes of diarrhea, especially feeding changes that may be associated with confi nement that coincides with treatment, should be considered.\n\n\u2022 Immediate cessation of antibiotic treatment is essential in any foal that suddenly develops diarrhea. In cases in which it is essential to maintain antibiotic treatment, e.g. septic arthritis, the use of antibiotics such as aminoglycosides that are not excreted or secreted into the bowel could be maintained. \u2022 Diarrhea usually resolves quickly when the inciting cause is removed. However, if treatment with the offending antibiotic is continued after diarrhea has commenced, it may become persistent and diffi cult to treat. \u2022 In cases in which diarrhea does not resolve following removal of the suspected cause, further diagnostics should be performed to rule out other possible causes e.g. Clostridium diffi cile. \u2022 Various treatments have been tried in cases that are slow to resolve.\n\nProbiotics are widely used and while there is little scientifi c evidence of their benefi ts many practitioners feel that they have a role in restoring some of the normal gut fl ora. Live yoghurt is also widely used based on the same principle but its effi cacy is unproven. \u2022 Metronidazole (10-15 mg/kg PO q8-12 h) is often used. \u2022 Transfaunation can be attempted in long-standing cases that have not responded to other treatments. Fresh cecal contents are collected from a recently dead horse and are then passed through a fi ne gauge sieve -1 L of the resultant fl uid is administered in two equal doses of 500 mL, 4 hours apart by nasogastric tube. There are few reports of successful treatments in this manner and this procedure does carry a risk of infection.\n\nRotaviral diarrhea (Fig 4.71 )\n\nRotavirus is a common cause of diarrhea in foals less than 3-6 months of age. Foals as young as 1 day of age may be affected. Outbreaks are not uncommon, particularly on large breeding farms. Other foals, adults or the environment may be sources of infection.\n\n\u2022 Diarrhea is the main complaint.\n\n\u2022 Mild depression, partial anorexia and pyrexia are usually present, and may develop 24 hours before diarrhea is passed. \u2022 Clinical signs may worsen as dehydration develops. \u2022 Ileus resulting in abdominal distension is frequently seen.\n\nSee pp. 101, 102.\n\n\u2022 ELISA, latex agglutination test or electron microscopy can be used to detect rotavirus in feces. \u2022 Because of the potential for co-infection, testing for other enteropathogens should also be performed. \u2022 A complete blood cell count, serum biochemical profi le and plasma fi brinogen are useful to direct supportive therapy. IgG determination should be performed in foals less than 1 week of age. \u2022 Translocation of bacteria is not uncommon in foals affected with rotavirus. Blood culture should be performed in moderate to severely affected foals to rule out secondary bacteremia.\n\n\u2022 Rotaviral diarrhea may be self-limiting and typically resolves within 3-5 days. \u2022 Supportive therapy including intravenous fl uid therapy and nutritional support may be required. \u2022 Lactase supplementation may be useful because rotaviral diarrhea has been associated with lactase defi ciency in other species. \u2022 Affected foals and their dams should be regarded as infectious and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent spread to other foals. \u2022 If ileus and abdominal distension are present, the use of prokinetics such as neostigmine and analgesics may be indicated (see p. 131). \u2022 Phenolic disinfectants should be used for footbaths and stall cleaning as chlorine containing compounds are not effective against rotavirus.\n\nClostridium diffi cile and C. perfringens are the most commonly identifi ed causes of diarrhea in foals in some areas. Outbreaks can occur and disease can range from mild to fatal. Foals as young as 12 hours of age may be affected. Clostridial diarrhea may be more commonly associated with preceding antimicrobial therapy.\n\n\u2022 Clinical signs can be highly variable. Diarrhea is the most consistent fi nding, but may not be observed initially in some cases. Bloody diarrhea may be passed; however fecal character has no diagnostic value. \u2022 Varying degrees of abdominal pain, abdominal distension, dehydration, toxemia and weakness are present. Occasionally, severe abdominal pain and abdominal distension with small intestinal distension and hypomotility may be present, mimicking a strangulating small intestinal lesion.\n\nDiarrhea may also be caused by: \n\n\u2022 Toxin ELISA on feces. Ideally, the test should be able to detect both C. diffi cile toxins A and B, although tests that only detect toxin A are still useful. A single sample is adequate unless the sample was collected very early in disease. \u2022 Fecal culture is less rewarding because C. diffi cile is diffi cult to isolate, and isolation of the organism does not necessarily indicate disease. \u2022 Detection of glutamate dehydrogenase (\"common antigen\") in feces can be used in conjunction with toxin ELISA, but alone is not adequate for diagnosis. \n\n\u2022 ELISA for C. perfringens enterotoxin. Currently, tests for other toxins are not available. \u2022 Fecal culture is of limited use by itself because C. perfringens is very commonly found in normal foals. Culture followed by genotyping of isolates may be more useful, particularly if a Type C strain is identifi ed. The relevance of the presence of other strains in the intestinal tract is unclear. If severe abdominal pain and/or abdominal distension are present, abdominal ultrasonography and radiography are indicated. Intestinal rupture can develop secondary to enteritis so any deterioration in clinical condition should prompt a thorough re-evaluation.\n\nOther diagnostic testing is important to direct supportive care. This should include a complete blood cell count, serum biochemical profi le, plasma fi brinogen assay and blood culture.\n\n\u2022 Supportive therapy is critical. Intravenous fl uid therapy is often required and oncotic support in the form of plasma or synthetic colloids may be necessary. Plasma is also required if failure of passive transport is present. \u2022 NSAID therapy may be useful and other analgesics or prokinetics may also be required (see p. 131). \u2022 In neonatal foals with diarrhea, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy, such as a combination of penicillin and amikacin, is justifi able based on concerns about bacterial translocation and bacteremia. \u2022 Gastric ulcer prophylaxis is controversial in neonatal foals and some authors recommend avoiding it because the increased gastric pH could allow for increased survival of ingested clostridia. Decisions regarding gastric ulcer prophylaxis should take into consideration such factors as the prevalence of clostridial infections in the area, concurrent illnesses, use of NSAIDs and other risk factors for the development of gastric ulceration (see p. 96). Sucralfate is a treatment for gastric ulceration that does not result in an increased gastric pH and may be a good choice in neonates at risk of clostridial infection (see pp. 98-99). \u2022 Metronidazole appears to be effective against enteric clostridia and is frequently used. \u2022 Di-tri-octahedral smectite (BioSponge TM ) may adsorb clostridial toxins in the intestinal tract. \u2022 In some cases, severe abdominal pain, abdominal distension and small intestinal hypomotility will result in exploratory surgery because of concerns regarding a surgical lesion. \u2022 Affected foals (and their dams) should be considered infectious.\n\nSalmonellosis is a cause of enteritis and sepsis in foals as young as 1 day of age. A small percentage of normal horses will transiently shed Salmonella spp. Foals are more susceptible to infection, and failure of passive transfer of maternal antibodies likely increases the chance of sepsis associated with salmonellosis.\n\n\u2022 Varying degrees of diarrhea, depression, weakness, dehydration, endotoxemia, hypotension, anorexia and pyrexia may be present. \u2022 A common fi nding in foals with salmonellosis is severe leukopenia which is followed by a massive rebound leucocytosis. \u2022 Severely affected foals may be recumbent from severe dehydration, toxemia, acidosis and/or hypoglycemia. \u2022 Sepsis can occur secondary to salmonellosis, complicating the clinical presentation. \n\n\u2022 Fecal culture: Salmonella can be diffi cult to isolate and requires adequate sample size (minimum 10 g) and enrichment culture. Failure to isolate the organism even after a number of attempts does not rule it out. Although challenging, fecal cultures should be performed on feces from both the foal and dam as isolation of the organism provides a defi nitive diagnosis and antibiotic sensitivity can guide treatment. \u2022 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test kits are available and may be useful in cases in which fecal cultures are negative. \u2022 Complete blood cell count, serum biochemical profi le and plasma fi brinogen for baseline information. \u2022 IgG level should be evaluated in foals less than 2 weeks of age. \u2022 Blood culture should be performed in foals with signs of systemic compromise. \u2022 Testing for other enteropathogens should also be performed.\n\n\u2022 Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is indicated in young foals, not to treat enteric Salmonella but for treatment or prevention of bacterial translocation. A combination of penicillin and amikacin is a reasonable initial choice, pending culture and sensitivity results. \u2022 Intravenous fl uid therapy is indicated in dehydrated, toxemic or hypotensive foals. \u2022 Low-dose (\"anti-endotoxin\") doses of fl unixin meglumine may be useful. \u2022 Oral or nasogastric administration of di-tri-octahedral smectite (BioSponge TM ) may bind to intestinal endotoxin. \u2022 Nutritional support may be required if foals are unable to adequately nurse (see: Feeding the sick foal, p. 129). \u2022 J-5 plasma transfusion is useful in any affected foal and is critical in foals with failure of passive transfer of maternal antibodies (see p. 297). Sepsis can also alter the distribution and catabolism of IgG making transfusions necessary in foals that had previously been assessed with adequate IgG. Synthetic colloids may also be given for oncotic support, if required. \u2022 Foals should be monitored closely for signs of extraintestinal disease (i.e. septic arthritis). \u2022 Infected animals should be regarded as infectious.\n\nThe exact role of E. coli in enteric infections in foals is debatable. Identifi cation of E. coli in feces is not indicative of a primary enteric infection. However, blood cultures from septicemic foals frequently yield E. coli spp, and septicemic invasion may be more important than infection with the enteric or enterotoxigenic forms. Enteric infections may occur secondary to antibiotic usage or follow other infections.\n\nDiarrhea can range from mild to severe. Foals that develop diarrhea associated with E. coli septicemia are typically seriously ill, with marked fevers, depression and signs of endotoxemia.\n\n\u2022 As stated above the isolation of E. coli from fecal samples is inconclusive. \u2022 Identifi cation of specifi c enterotoxins is required for a defi nitive diagnosis of a primary E. coli enteric infection. Such testing has only a limited availability. \u2022 Identifi cation of E. coli in blood cultures is defi nitive for septicemia.\n\nAggressive treatment of septicemic cases is required with antimicrobial selection based on sensitivity testing. Other important aspects of treatment include fl uid therapy, correction of electrolyte and acidbase abnormalities, anti-endotoxin therapy, plasma transfusions for passive transfer of maternal antibodies and oncotic support.\n\nA variety of intestinal parasites can be found in foals but most are of limited clinical signifi cance, even with large burdens. \u2022 Ascarids (Parascaris equorum) are a signifi cant concern, and are the most important intestinal parasite of foals in most areas. \u2022 Strongyloides westerii may be a cause of disease in 2-4-week-old foals with signifi cant worm burdens; however its true role in disease is of debate. \u2022 Cyathostominosis (larval cyathostomiasis) may occur in foals as young as 3-4 months of age, but is more common in yearlings and older horses. \u2022 Cryptosporidium and Giardia spp are uncommon causes of diarrhea, and are likely more important in immunocompromised foals.\n\n\u2022 Ill-thrift, weight loss, failure to grow normally and diarrhea are common presenting complaints. \u2022 Intestinal obstruction and rupture with ascarids can develop particularly after deworming foals with a large burden. \u2022 Signifi cant hypoproteinemia and weight loss can occur with cyathostominosis.\n\nFor other causes of diarrhea see above. Hypoproteinemia can also be caused by:\n\n\u2022 salmonellosis \u2022 clostridial diarrhea \u2022 protein-losing nephropathy \u2022 Lawsonia intracellularis infection \u2022 poor diet. \n\n\u2022 Fecal fl otation and smear can be used to identify certain parasites. Quantitation of fecal egg numbers can be useful. However, ascarids and cyathostomes cannot always be identifi ed in this manner. \u2022 Foals with severe ascarid infection may be seen to pass whole worms in their feces. \u2022 In some cases of severe infection the parasites have been visualized within the bowel or free in the abdomen (in cases of intestinal rupture) by ultrasonographic examination. \u2022 Testing for other enteropathogens, particularly those that are contagious, should be performed if diarrhea is present. \u2022 Defi nitive diagnosis of certain conditions such as cyathostominosis is diffi cult and may only be made at surgery or necropsy.\n\n\u2022 Deworming should be addressed both at the individual and farm levels.\n\n\u2022 Deworming programs are variable and depend on a variety of factors including geographic location (especially climate), amount of horse movement, horse density, pasture availability, pasture management, prevalence of individual parasites in the area and anthelmintic resistance. \u2022 Excessive administration of dewormers should be avoided. \u2022 Monitoring of fecal egg counts can be used to guide anthelmintic therapy, depending on the parasites of concern. Drugs with a narrow margin of safety (e.g. avermectins/milbemycin) should be used carefully and avoided in foals less than 12 weeks of age as they have been known to cross the blood-brain barrier in young foals leading to serious side effects. \u2022 Deworming programs should pay particular attention to ascarids.\n\nAscarid eggs are extremely durable and resistant to adverse weather conditions. They can survive in the environment without herbage for up to 5 years. In general only young horses (or debilitated older animals) are at risk from ascarid infections as strong immunity develops with exposure and most animals self-cure by 18 months of age, although adults may harbor a few ascarids, which can act as source of infection for foals. \u2022 While many anthelmintics (piperazine, benzimadazoles, pyrantels, ivermectin and moxidectin) have effi cacy against ascarids it is generally shorter than their effi cacy for other parasites and few if any are effective against migratory forms. Re-infection has been known to occur in as little as 2 weeks after treatment if the foal remains in a contaminated environment. In designing deworming programs for ascarids it is important to eliminate infection from mares to prevent environmental contamination and it is thus recommended to treat mares monthly in the last trimester of pregnancy.\n\nProliferative enteropathy caused by L. intracellularis typically affects 4-7-month-old foals. Multiple animals on the same farm may be affected.\n\n\u2022 Onset may be insidious and abnormal signs not identifi ed until disease is advanced. \u2022 Weakness, depression, fevers, ill-thrift, poor body condition and peripheral edema are most common. \u2022 Diarrhea is not present in all cases and the hypoproteinemia is often more severe than would be expected considering the duration and severity of diarrhea.\n\nOther causes of hypoproteinemia and chronic weight loss include:\n\n\u2022 infectious diarrhea of other etiologies \u2022 malnutrition/poor diet \u2022 infl ammatory bowel disease (rare in this age group) \u2022 intestinal neoplasia \u2022 protein-losing nephropathy \u2022 parasitism.\n\n\u2022 Total protein levels should be evaluated and monitored during treatment. Marked hypoproteinemia is almost invariably present. \u2022 Serology can be useful. \u2022 Detection of L. intracellularis in feces via PCR is diagnostic but a negative result does not rule it out. \u2022 Testing for other enteropathogens should be performed because co-infection can occur. \u2022 Thickened small intestine may be evident ultrasonographically.\n\n(Normal mural thickness <3.5 mm.) \u2022 Surgical biopsy or necropsy may be required for a defi nitive diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 Macrolides can be used, although other antimicrobials such as chloramphenicol may also be effective. \u2022 Tetracyclines (oxytetracycline, doxycycline) are the most commonly used antimicrobial in pigs with the same disorder and they have also been used successfully in foals. \u2022 Supportive therapy, particularly oncotic support, is important, as is nutritional support. Parenteral nutrition is required in severely affected foals.\n\n\u2022 Diarrhea as a result of R. equi infection is a common occurrence in endemic areas. In a study at the University of Kentucky diagnostic lab, 50% of R. equi pneumonic foals presented to necropsy also had intestinal manifestations characterized by granulomatous or suppurative infl ammation of the Peyer's patches and the mesenteric and/or colonic lymph nodes. The majority of foals with R. equi pneumonia do not show clinical signs of the intestinal disease. It is also speculated that foals with subclinical intestinal manifestations may not gain body weight as readily as they should. \u2022 Diarrhea rarely occurs alone. In the same study, only 4% of the foals with intestinal R. equi lesions did not have pneumonia. However, other symptoms such as bronchopneumonia, uveitis or joint infections may not be immediately apparent. \u2022 Disease is most frequently seen between 2 weeks and 6 months. The peak age incidence varies with location and may vary with the local climate. \u2022 In some cases bronchopneumonia is seen fi rst and may be followed by diarrhea. In these cases it may not initially be clear if diarrhea is antibiotic-induced as a result of treatment for the bronchopneumonia or if it is related to the primary disease process.\n\nActinobacillus equuli causes diarrhea in association with septicemia in foals less than 2 weeks old. There is a high mortality rate and identification of the organism on blood culture warrants aggressive treatment and a guarded prognosis. A. equuli septicemia is associated with profound depression and is often referred to as \"sleepy foal disease.\"\n\nGiardia intestinalis, a protozoal parasite, is a recognized cause of enteric disease in some species but its role in foal diarrhea is currently unclear. Foals are probably exposed to Giardia through ingestion of feces of infected mares and other horses. Giardiasis, if it occurs, is probably more of a concern in immunocompromised foals.\n\nThere is little known about the clinical presentation of giardiasis in foals. If it does occur, it presumably causes mild to moderate diarrhea, which is non-specifi c in character. Dehydration and anorexia could result in development of secondary clinical signs such as weakness.\n\nSee pp. 101, 102.\n\nDiagnosis (and determination of the role of Giardia in foal diarrhea) is complicated by the fact that normal foals and horses can shed Giardia.\n\nStudies have reported shedding rates of up to 35% in normal foals. Therefore, detection of Giardia cysts in a diarrheic foal is not diagnostic. Giardia cysts or trophozoites can be visually identifi ed in feces by direct evaluation of fecal smears or by concentration methods (i.e. zinc sulfate fecal fl otation). Fluorescent antibody staining may also be used. Antigen tests (ELISA) are available but they have not been validated for use in horses and results should therefore be interpreted with caution. Testing for other enteropathogens should be performed because of the unclear relevance of identifi cation of Giardia and the potential for co-infection.\n\n\u2022 There has been minimal evaluation of treatment. Fenbendazole is used in other species, and its use in foals is reasonable. \u2022 Metronidazole is considered to be less effective in other species but is still widely used and its use has been reported in an adult horse with presumptive giardiasis. \u2022 Giardiasis is a zoonotic disease so appropriate precautions should be taken to prevent transmission. \u2022 Nitazoxanide has been used in human medicine for the treatment of Giardia. In the United States, nitazoxanide is the active component in Navigator \u00ae an antiprotozoal medication used to treat equine protozoal meningitis. The dose that one of the editors (NMS) has used in foals is 25 mg/kg for 7 days.\n\nCryptosporidiosis is caused by Cryptosporidium parvum, a protozoan parasite of many species. The overall role of C. parvum in foal diarrhea is unclear but there is reasonable evidence that it can be pathogenic. One study reported a signifi cant association between the presence of C. parvum and diarrhea, and an increased incidence of fatal disease compared to other enteropathogens. However, subclinical infection is probably very common and disease may be more common in immunocompromised foals, particularly foals with severe combined immunodefi ciency syndrome (SCID).\n\nCryptosporidiosis is associated with mild to severe diarrhea. Signs of toxemia and systemic infl ammation are not apparent initially but secondary effects including dehydration, depression and weakness can occur because of fl uid and electrolyte loss, and anorexia. Death can occur. The prepatent period is 3-7 days.\n\nSee pp. 101, 102.\n\n\u2022 C. parvum oocysts can be seen directly on fecal smears or with concentration techniques, but identifi cation of them can be diffi cult. Oocysts are small and easily missed by examiners without ample experience. \u2022 Acid-fast or other specifi c strains can be used to evaluate fecal smears and increase the sensitivity of diagnosis, as can direct immunofl uoresence. \u2022 Testing should be performed for other enteropathogens.\n\n\u2022 Cryptosporidiosis is a self-limiting disease. There are no known specifi c therapies for cryptosporidiosis in foals. Clinical signs usually persist for 5-14 days. During that time, supportive therapy, including fl uid therapy and nutritional support, may be required. \u2022 The prognosis should be good if appropriate supportive care is provided. \u2022 This is a zoonotic pathogen so care should be taken to reduce the risk of human infection. Nitazoxanide has been used in human medicine for the treatment of Cryptosporidium. Its use in foals is reasonable (see Treatment of Giardiasis p. 112)\n\nEimeria leuckarti, E. uniungulsti and E. solipedum are coccidia that can be found in horses. Eimeria leuckarti is most commonly found and can be detected in up to 40% of healthy foals in some areas. The prepatent period of E. leuckarti is approximately 35 days. The role of Eimeria spp in foal diarrhea is unclear, and experimental infection of foals has not resulted in production of disease. As a result, if disease does occur, it is probably rare and perhaps more associated with immunocompromised animals\n\nIf it exists, coccidiosis is presumably associated with mild to moderate diarrhea, without apparent toxemia.\n\nSee pp. 101,102.\n\nFecal fl otation can be used to detect Eimeria oocysts. Testing for other enteropathogens should be performed.\n\nTreatment has not been described because Eimeria are not thought to be pathogenic in horses.\n\nColic as an expression of abdominal pain in foals is extremely common. Abdominal pain in neonatal foals is always signifi cant but the severity of the signs may not correspond to the severity of the lesion and thus the degree of pain is not a clear indicator as to the presence of a surgical lesion. Diagnosing the exact cause of the abdominal pain may be challenging but a thorough examination is warranted as changes can occur quickly, resulting in a rapid deterioration of clinical condition.\n\n\u2022 Congenital conditions \u2666 atresia ani/atresia coli (severe) \u2666 meconium impaction (moderate to severe) \u2666 lethal white (severe) \u2666 prematurity/dysmaturity (mild to moderate) \u2666 ruptured bladder syndrome (mild to moderate) \u2022 Thoracic or abdominal trauma following rib fractures \u2022 Infectious enteritis/colitis \u2022 Gastric/duodenal ulceration \u2022 Physiological ileus (electrolyte disturbances) \u2022 Peritonitis \u2022 Surgical lesions \u2666 complicated hernias -inguinal, scrotal or umbilical \u2666 intestinal volvulus or displacement \u2666 intussusception.\n\n\u2022 Congenital conditions \u2666 ruptured bladder syndrome \u2022 Thoracic or abdominal trauma following rib fractures \u2022 Infectious enteritis/colitis \u2022 Non-infectious diarrhea e.g. lactose intolerance, antibiotic-induced diarrhea \u2022 Gastric/duodenal ulceration \u2022 Duodenal stricture \u2022 Strangulating obstructions \u2022 Non-strangulating obstructions (Ascarid or feed-related impactions, intussusceptions, foreign bodies) \u2022 Complicated hernias \u2022 Other less common causes of colic: \u2666 adhesions (post surgery or following severe enteritis) \u2666 fecoliths in miniature horses \u2666 white muscle disease.\n\nAs above and Strongylus spp related vascular thrombosis.\n\nEnteritis is a common problem in foals and can be caused by a variety of pathogens. Regardless of the cause, signs of abdominal pain may be present in diarrheic foals. Additionally, intestinal accidents (i.e. intussusceptions) can occasionally develop secondary to abnormal intestinal motility.\n\nTypical signs of abdominal pain are often observed in diarrheic foals and are usually apparent before the onset of diarrhea. These may range from mild and intermittent to severe, protracted and poorly responsive to analgesics. Some diarrheic foals will develop colic of such severity that exploratory surgery is required.\n\nOther possible causes of abdominal pain in diarrheic foals include: \u2022 secondary intestinal rupture \u2022 gastric ulceration \u2022 gastric dilation. \n\n\u2022 A full examination should be performed on colicky diarrheic foals to ensure that a concurrent or secondary lesion is not present. \u2022 Abdominal ultrasonography may demonstrate distended, hypermotile small intestine and/or fl uidy, distended large intestine. Ultrasonographic examination is critical in severely colicky diarrheic foals. Poor intestinal motility and intestinal distension with progressive clinical signs are indicators that surgery should be considered. \u2022 Gastroscopy can detect gastric ulcers. \u2022 A nasogastric tube should be passed to rule out gastric refl ux, which could be present from ileus, abnormal intestinal motility or secondary intestinal accident.\n\n\u2022 Supportive care and specifi c treatment as described for different causes of diarrhea is the most important aspect of treatment. \u2022 Analgesics may be administered as needed. Excessive analgesia should be avoided so that progression of disease or development of a surgical lesion is not missed. Prokinetics may be required in some cases where colic signs are related to small intestinal ileus or gaseous distension of the large intestine (see p. 131 and Appendix 5).\n\nLarge colon displacement occurs less often in foals compared to adult horses. Gaseous distension of the colon may predispose to displacement.\n\n\u2022 Characteristic signs of abdominal pain, including rolling, lying on the back, stretching, fl ank watching, tail fl icking, stranguria and tenesmus may be present. \u2022 Abdominal distension may be severe.\n\n\u2666 If colonic edema is noted along with unrelenting pain then an exploratory celiotomy will be warranted. \u2022 Heart rate may be elevated consistent with the degree of pain. Signs of cardiovascular compromise or toxemia should not be present.\n\nSee above.\n\n\u2022 Physical examination and monitoring of abdominal distension will help determine whether surgical intervention is required. \u2022 Diagnostic imaging (ultrasound, radiography) may reveal large colon distension, but not a specifi c lesion. \u2022 Defi nitive diagnosis is usually made at surgery. \u2022 A nasogastric tube should be passed to detect nasogastric refl ux, which may occur secondarily.\n\n\u2022 In some cases, displacements will correct spontaneously with supportive therapy. Pain control and fl uid therapy are usually required. Temporary withholding of nursing may assist in decreasing intestinal distension and increase the likelihood of spontaneous correction. \u2022 Surgery will be required in foals with severe, uncontrollable or progressive pain or abdominal distension. It should also be considered in foals that demonstrate colonic edema on ultrasonographic examination. If signs of toxemia or cardiovascular compromise develop, surgery should be performed immediately. At surgery, the colon can be decompressed and placed in its normal orientation.\n\nTorsion of the large colon is uncommon in foals, but can occur. Vascular compromise can develop rapidly and large colon torsion is an emergency situation.\n\n\u2022 Progressive abdominal pain and distension are the most common signs. \u2022 Heart rate will be elevated consistent with the degree of pain and toxemia. \u2022 Dehydration may be present, and can be severe. \u2022 As vascular compromise develops, mucous membrane colour will deteriorate and other signs of cardiovascular compromise such as cool extremities and poor peripheral pulses may be observed. Affected foals can deteriorate rapidly, progressing from mild to intractable pain very quickly.\n\nOther causes of abdominal distension and severe pain include:\n\n\u2022 enteritis (clostridiosis, salmonellosis) \u2022 peritonitis, often secondary to gastric ulcer perforation \u2022 other intestinal accident such as small intestinal volvulus \u2022 meconium impaction \u2022 atresia ani/coli \u2022 lethal white foal syndrome.\n\n\u2022 Defi nitive diagnosis is diffi cult without surgical exploration. The diagnostic plan should be aimed at determining whether surgical exploration is indicated. \u2022 Abdominal ultrasonography and radiography will demonstrate intestinal distension and sometimes serosal edema primarily caused by large colon distension, but will not identify a specifi c lesion. \u2022 Abdominocentesis may be useful to identify intestinal compromise.\n\nHowever, normal peritoneal fl uid does not rule out large colon torsion. \u2022 Blood gas analysis is useful to assess acid-base status, and guide preoperative therapy. \u2022 In young foals (<2 days) the owners should be queried as to whether the foal has ever defecated, to rule out intestinal atresia. \u2022 A nasogastric tube should be passed to check for refl ux, which may occur secondarily.\n\n\u2022 Rapid surgical exploration is required. During preparation for surgery, intravenous fl uid therapy should be started to maintain perfusion, maintain blood pressure and attempt to correct any acidbase abnormalities. \u2022 Analgesics will be required prior to surgery, either for transportation to a surgical facility or while preparing for surgery (see p. 131). \u2022 Rarely, abdominal trocarization will be required to partially decompress the abdomen prior to induction of anesthesia. This should be reserved for situations where there is a delay in going to surgery or distension is so great that anesthetic complications are a serious concern. At surgery, the lesion can be identifi ed and the viability of the colon assessed.\n\nObstruction of the small intestine is uncommon in foals, and is typically associated with impaction of ascarids (Parascaris equorum). Ascarid impactions are most common in weanlings, particularly those with inadequate deworming programs. Foals with ascarid impactions typically develop clinical signs shortly after deworming, as adult worms are killed and lodge in the small intestine. Spontaneous ascarid impactions may also develop. Other possible causes of obstruction include impaction of intestinal contents (esp. ileal impaction) and foreign bodies.\n\n\u2022 Colic of variable intensity will be present. If gastric distension has developed, foals may be in severe pain. \u2022 Abdominal distension may be present, but is typically less than with large colon disease. \u2022 With simple obstruction, there should be no signs of toxemia or cardiovascular compromise because intestinal viability is not compromised. \n\nSmall intestinal distension can also be caused by:\n\n\u2022 small intestinal strangulating lesion (i.e. volvulus) \u2022 enteritis \u2022 ileus.\n\n\u2022 Distended loops of small intestine are usually evident ultrasonographically. Occasionally, an obstruction (e.g. accumulation of ascarids) may be seen. \u2022 Ascarid impaction should be considered likely in foals with an acute onset of severe colic with small intestinal distension that develops shortly after deworming. This is particularly true following late initial deworming.\n\n\u2022 A nasogastric tube should be passed to determine whether gastric refl ux is present. With large worm burdens, adult ascarids are sometimes present in gastric refl ux. \u2022 Abdominocentesis can be used to assess intestinal viability, which should be normal with simple obstruction. \u2022 Exploratory surgery is often required for defi nitive diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 Withholding of feed and intravenous fl uid therapy may result in resolution of feed-associated impactions and incomplete obstructions with ascarids. Osmotic cathartics should not be used. \u2022 Frequent gastric decompression may be required. \u2022 Often, surgery is required because of poor response to medical treatment, severity of clinical signs or concern that a strangulating lesion might be present. Surgery is usually required for ascarid impactions and foreign body obstruction. The prognosis for small intestinal obstructions requiring surgery is guarded. \u2022 If ascarid impaction was present, deworming and pasture management should be addressed to prevent further cases on the farm.\n\nVolvulus of the small intestine is one of the most common causes of surgical colic in foals, and is most common in 2-5-month-old foals.\n\n\u2022 Colic (rolling, fl ank watching, tail swishing, stretching) is the main initial sign and may be of sudden onset. Pain is progressive and can rapidly become severe, particularly as gastric distension develops. \u2022 Poor response to analgesics is common. \u2022 Signs of toxemia and cardiovascular compromise (prolonged CRT, hyperemic mucous membranes, cool extremities) may develop as the intestine becomes devitalized. \n\nOther causes of small intestinal obstruction (see above).\n\n\u2022 Distended, hypomotile or amotile loops of small intestine are evident ultrasonographically with or without serosal edema and thickening (>3.5 mm). \u2022 Nasogastric refl ux may be present. \u2022 Abdominal fl uid may be normal, cloudy or hemorrhagic, depending on the degree of intestinal compromise. \u2022 Defi nitive diagnosis is achieved at surgery.\n\nEarly identifi cation and surgical correction is required. The prognosis is better if the intestine appears viable after correction of the volvulus and no resection is required than if part of the small intestine must be (e.g. enteritis). Enteritis may be a predisposing factor. In older foals, tapeworm infestation may also be a risk factor.\n\n\u2022 Typically, intestinal obstruction causes development of acute and progressive signs of colic. Often, gastric decompression does not result in signifi cant clinical improvement. Abdominal distension may occur but is not consistent. \u2022 Signs of toxemia and cardiovascular compromise are uncommon initially but may develop with intestinal compromise or rupture. \u2022 Sometimes, an incompletely obstructive intussusception may be associated with chronic colic.\n\nOther causes of colic without diarrhea include:\n\n\u2022 small intestinal volvulus \u2022 gastric/gastroduodenal ulceration \u2022 impending diarrhea \u2022 intestinal obstruction \u2022 other intestinal accident.\n\n\u2022 A nasogastric tube should be passed. Nasogastric refl ux will be seen with more proximal lesions such as jeuno-jejunal or jejuno-ileal intussusceptions but will develop over time with more distal lesions. \u2022 Small intestinal distension will be evident ultrasonographically on the right side of the abdomen. Intestinal motility is variable, and the presence of distended but motile small intestine does not rule out intussusception. Often the intussusception may be detected ultrasonographically by imaging the characteristic \"target lesion.\" \u2022 Abdominocentesis is useful to identify changes consistent with intestinal compromise (see p. 79). \u2022 In the absence of an identifi ed \"target lesion,\" defi nitive diagnosis is made at surgery.\n\nSurgical correction is required in most cases. The decision to go to surgery should be based on the persistence of colic signs and refl ux. On occasion intussusceptions may resolve spontaneously or following induction of general anesthesia. Prognosis depends on the amount of involved intestine and the type of surgery that was required, but is guarded to poor overall. \n\nUmbilical hernias are common congenital defects of the body wall with the incidence reported to be as high as 2% in Thoroughbred foals. Body wall hernias other than umbilical hernias can occur following surgery or trauma. Inguinal/scrotal hernias are also seen in young colts and can be present at birth or may develop within several days and are related to large inguinal rings, trauma, and increased abdominal pressure and straining. Inguinal hernias are usually unilateral but can be bilateral and are commonly seen in Tennessee walkers and Standardbred.\n\nMost congenital inguinal hernias are indirect, with the intestines passing through an intact vaginal ring and contained within the parietal layer of the vaginal tunic. Indirect hernias are usually reducible, are not life threatening and usually resolve with manual reduction within a few days. A direct hernia occurs when the parietal vaginal tunic or the peritoneum in the vaginal ring region tears and the intestines become positioned under the skin. Direct hernias are normally irreducible, contain large amounts of intestine, are life threatening and regarded as a surgical emergency.\n\nAn uncomplicated hernia is any type of hernia which either does not contain intestine or contains non-incarcerated intestine. A complicated hernia is any type of hernia which contains incarcerated or strangulated intestine.\n\n\u2022 Hernias are usually apparent visually or detected by palpation. In most cases of umbilical or inguinal hernia, there are no clinical abnormalities. \u2022 Individual loops of small intestine may be apparent under the skin in foals with direct inguinal hernias. The inguinal skin is thin and associated stretching may result in tearing of the skin or disruption of dermal circulation. \u2022 Signs of colic are often but not always observed when strangulation has occurred, but will develop as intestinal compromise progresses and intestinal distension develops.\n\nOther similarly appearing masses include:\n\n\u2022 abscess \u2022 hematoma \u2022 seroma.\n\n\u2022 Physical examination, including palpation of the hernia, is typically diagnostic. \u2022 The hernia should be reduced, if possible, and the ease of reduction noted. The presence of intestine within the hernia is not necessarily a signifi cant concern unless it cannot be reduced. \u2022 Ultrasonographic examination can differentiate non-reducible hernia from an abscess, and characterize the hernia contents. \u2022 Signs that suggest strangulation include an inability to reduce the hernia, increased hernia size, pain, heat, increased fi rmness, edema and pain on palpation. Strangulation should be suspected in any foal with a hernia that develops colic.\n\n\u2022 A conservative approach is usually indicated initially. Small hernias usually correct without treatment in the fi rst few weeks of life.\n\nOwners should be instructed to monitor the size of the hernia and reduce it frequently. Any change in clinical condition of a foal with a hernia, particularly a large hernia, should result in prompt veterinary examination. Bandages or hernia clamps can be used to maintain reduction and allow for spontaneous closure of the hernia ring. Hernia clamps/rubber rings may facilitate closure by stimulating scar tissue formation. Pressure sores are a potential complication of bandaging for inguinal hernias. This foal required cardio-respiratory resuscitation on presentation and surgery was not performed as he was considered too great an anesthetic risk. This hernia was manual reduced and an inguinal bandage placed which was changed daily for two weeks. The hernia did not recur and the colt was castrated by a closed technique as a weanling. \u2022 Larger hernias, for example umbilical hernias greater than 5 cm in diameter, are more prone to complications and less likely to correct spontaneously. \u2022 In general, elective surgical correction is indicated for large hernias (i.e. umbilical hernia >7-10 cm) or ones that have not resolved by 7-9 months of age. \u2022 If a strangulating hernia is suspected, prompt surgical intervention is required. Concurrent removal of the testicle is recommended in scrotal or inguinal hernias to facilitate closure of the inguinal ring.\n\nA variety of other causes of colic can occur, including displacements, impactions, incarcerations, intussusceptions, ileus and obstructions other than those described above. Foals that are unable to nurse normally may be more likely to develop intestinal obstructions associated with inappropriate ingestion of feed and non-feed items. Miniature horse foals are prone to development of fecoliths.\n\nCharacteristic signs of abdominal pain include rolling, lying on the back, fl ank watching, tail fl icking, stranguria and tenesmus. Partial or complete anorexia is common. Abdominal distension may be present. Heart rate is usually elevated consistent with the apparent degree of pain. Pyrexia is uncommon.\n\nSigns of abdominal pain are non-specifi c and can be caused by a variety of other intestinal diseases including:\n\n\u2022 enteritis \u2022 lactase defi ciency. Non-intestinal diseases that may appear similar include: \u2022 ruptured bladder \u2022 peritonitis.\n\n\u2022 A full physical examination is required to differentiate colic from similarly appearing non-intestinal diseases. \u2022 A nasogastric tube should be passed to detect gastric refl ux. \u2022 Diagnostic imaging (ultrasound, radiographs) can be useful to identify a specifi c lesion or assist in deciding whether surgery is indicated. \u2022 Gastroscopy is useful, particularly in mild or chronic cases, to rule out gastric ulceration. \u2022 Abdominocentesis can help assess bowel viability and assist in ruling out other conditions such as peritonitis and bladder rupture. \u2022 Serial measurement of abdominal distension can be used to monitor progression of disease.\n\n\u2022 Treatment depends on the specifi c cause.\n\n\u2022 Analgesics are often required (see p. 131). \u2022 Intravenous fl uid therapy may be required in foals that are dehydrated or anorexic. Nutritional support may also be required. \u2022 If nasogastric refl ux is present, frequent gastric decompression is critical. If intestinal or gastric distension is present, restriction of nursing may be required. \u2022 In mild/moderate cases, empirical treatment for gastric ulceration can be attempted. \u2022 Surgical intervention may be required in some cases.\n\nInfection of the umbilical vein, umbilical arteries or urachus is a common cause of abdominal abscessation. There may be a history of prior umbilical disease.\n\nLocalized peritonitis from a small duodenal ulcer may produce an abscess, and a history of clinical signs consistent with gastroduodenal ulceration may be present; however diffuse peritonitis is more common following intestinal perforation.\n\nRhodococcus equi abdominal abscesses have been identifi ed in older foals.\n\nAbscessation of abdominal lymph nodes can occur following any bacteremic event. Abscesses may develop following abdominal surgery, particularly if an enterotomy or resection has been performed. Sometimes, there is no history of a preceding event that would predispose to development of an abdominal abscess.\n\nThe clinical presentation can be highly variable. Intermittent fever, depression, weakness and poor body condition may be the only apparent signs. If the abscess is affecting passage of ingesta, or has resulted in intestinal adhesions, colic may occur.\n\nAbdominal abscesses are occasionally identifi ed incidentally during colic surgery. Small abscesses that are not associated with important structures or affecting intestinal motility may be present without any obvious clinical signs. Sometimes, these occult abdominal abscesses will rupture and the fi rst signs noted will be that of acute septic peritonitis. These include fever, weakness, depression, cardiovascular shock, signs of systemic toxemia, abdominal distension, abdominal pain or sudden death.\n\n\u2022 Intermittent fever, depression and poor body condition can also be caused by:\n\n\u2666 lung abscesses \u2666 enteritis \u2666 Lawsonia intracellularis infection \u2666 neoplasia. \u2022 Other causes of septic peritonitis include: \u2666 perforated gastric ulcer \u2666 perforated duodenal ulcer \u2666 rupture of intestinal viscera.\n\n\u2022 Careful palpation of the external umbilicus should be performed; however a normal external umbilicus does not rule out abscessation of internal umbilical structures.\n\n\u2022 Leukocytosis consisting mainly of a neutrophilia will almost always be present, as will a moderate to marked increase in plasma fi brinogen. \u2022 Blood culture may identify the etiologic agent if bacteria are periodically being shed from the abscess. Blood culture is best performed prior to initiation of antimicrobial treatment and during an episode of pyrexia. \u2022 An echogenic mass consistent with an abscess may be evident via ultrasound (see Fig 10.35 p. 289 ). \u2022 Abdominocentesis should be performed, ideally after ultrasonographic examination so that a fl uid pocket might be identifi ed and an abscess is not inadvertently tapped. \u2022 Aspiration of an abscess identifi ed ultrasonographically should only be performed if there is clear evidence that the abscess has a distinct wall that is fused to the body wall. Otherwise, aspiration could result in contamination of the abdomen with subsequent septic peritonitis. \u2022 Thoracic radiographs/ultrasonography are indicated to rule out concurrent lung abscesses if R. equi is considered a possible cause. \u2022 While currently of limited availability, advanced imaging techniques such as CT and MRI can be useful in small foals. \u2022 Exploratory celiotomy is often required for defi nitive diagnosis.\n\n\u2022 Long-term antimicrobial therapy may be effective in some cases with small abscesses and no active, underlying disease. Therapy is ideally based on culture and sensitivity data; however empirical selection is usually required. Erythromycin, azithromycin or clarithromycin with or without rifampin are reasonably effective for abscesses caused by Gram-positive organisms. \u2022 Surgical resection is rarely possible. If an abscess is associated with a discrete intestinal loop, resection of the abscess and intestine may be possible. Rupture of an abscess during surgical manipulation is a concern. Marsupialization of the abscess may be possible in some cases. \u2022 Hyperbaric medical therapy has been used in a limited number of foals with internal abscessation. Outcome for foals treated with hyperbaric medicine and diagnosed with an abscess <9 cm in size has been promising. More research is needed with regard to this treatment modality and it may be cost prohibitive in many cases. \u2022 Overall, the prognosis is guarded to poor.\n\nFeeding the orphan foal (Figs 4.134-4. \n\nOrphan foals are not uncommonly encountered, and early measures are required to maintain their health status, particularly in very young foals.\n\nIn foals that are orphaned shortly after birth, it is essential to ensure that adequate transfer of maternal antibodies is achieved. In the fi rst 12 hours of life, colostrum (fresh or frozen) or plasma can be fed. After this time, plasma must be administered intravenously. Immunoglobulin G levels should be checked approximately 12 hours after feeding or 24 hours after plasma transfusion to ensure that adequate levels have been provided. (See Chapter 11, p. 298).\n\nThe best means of feeding an orphan is a nurse mare. This is the preferred approach because it provides a normal diet and also aids in normal social development. Most foals will readily accept a nurse mare. The mare may be slower to accept the foal and many techniques such as blindfolding, restraints and sedation may be used to aid in acceptance of the foal.\n\nWith the increased value of Thoroughbred mares and foals, it is now increasingly uncommon for mares that have recently lost a foal to be used as foster mares. Most mares are supplied from agencies and are commonly mixed breed mares that foster different foals every year. It is important to choose a reputable agency that supplies mares in good health with up-to-date vaccinations. The advantages are that such mares will frequently accept a new foal with minimal fuss and assistance may be given with the fostering process.\n\nIf a nurse mare is not available, milk replacer will be required. There are many different brands available and the manufacturer's instructions should be followed with respect to quantity of feed and correct mixing technique. The use of an inappropriate milk replacer or improper dilution can result in diarrhea and other problems.\n\nUnderfeeding is a common problem in hand-raised foals. Foals drink approximately 20-25% of their body weight (BW) each day once they reach a week of age. Initial feeding programs should start at 10% of BW and increase by 1-2% until the goal of 20-25% is reached. Therefore, a 60 kg foal requires approximately 12-15 liters of milk replacer daily. See Table 4 .1 for estimation of volume requirements.\n\nFeedings should be at least every 1-2 hours over the fi rst 24-48 hours and the interval between feeds can then be gradually increased along with the volume given per feed.\n\nShould commercial forms of milk replacers not be available there are a number of other options: \u2022 Goat milk is well tolerated by foals and causes few problems (increase in fi rmness of stools and metabolic acidosis have been seen). No alterations are usually made but it is generally diffi cult to obtain and may be expensive. \u2022 Make your own: 250 mL of 2% cow's milk with 1 tsp of dextrose or white corn syrup added. This works well but again may be cost prohibitive. It may provide a \"stop gap\" remedy until commercial forms of milk replacer can be obtained. \u2022 Human and calf milk replacer are not suitable. Close attention should be paid to the foal's body condition and weight. Daily weight gains of 1.3-1.5 kg should be attained in Thoroughbred foals.\n\nBuckets are one way to provide milk replacer. Foals can usually be trained to drink from a bucket with few problems. An advantage of bucket feeding over bottle-feeding is that the foal has more control over timing and volume of intake.\n\nBottle-feeding is another option; however it is the least desirable. Bottle-feeding is time consuming and may result in inappropriate bonding of the foal with humans, which could result in behavioral problems later in life. Bottle-feeding is best reserved as a temporary measure while a nurse mare is being obtained.\n\nFoal replacer pellets/foal creep feed should be offered from one week of age. Foals should have access to hay because normal foals will ingest small amounts of their dams' diet.\n\nCompany, ideally a quiet older horse, is important for proper social development and development of correct eating habits. Orphan foals that are reared on their own may be slow to accept feedstuffs other than milk. This may not be a problem in the early stages but as the foal gets older it will make it diffi cult to attain adequate weight gain.\n\nGoats or sheep can be used as company if a suitable horse is not available. Under no circumstances should an orphan be placed with other mares and foals. Many mares will show very aggressive tendencies towards any foal that is not their own. While a foal should be able to handle the transition to a solid diet at 2-3 months of age, if required, it is best not to wean foals off milk replacer until they are 3-4 months of age.\n\nNutritional support is often required because feeding is being restricted or withheld, or the foal is unable or unwilling to ingest an adequate volume of milk.\n\nFeeding milk or milk replacer via an indwelling nasogastric tube can be very useful because it allows for feeding of a normal diet. Flexible tubes are preferred and they should be securely fastened. Potential complications include aspiration pneumonia and laryngeal/pharyngeal irritation.\n\nFeeding should be introduced gradually, start at 5% of BW and increase by 1-2% every 12 hours if feeding is tolerated. Sick foals should be fed regularly (hourly if possible) so that large volumes per feeding are not required. The nasogastric tube should be checked before every feeding, and replaced if there is any concern that it may no longer be in the proper location. Foals should be fed standing or in sternal recumbency, and kept upright for a period of time after feeding to reduce the ever-present risk of aspiration. It is wise to check for gastric refl ux before each feeding. Mare's milk is preferred, although foal milk replacers are also useful. Water or glucose containing electrolyte solutions cannot provide adequate energy intake, although they can be useful in combination with parenteral nutrition to nourish enterocytes in foals unable to tolerate milk.\n\nIn some cases, enteral feeding cannot be tolerated due to gas production resulting in abdominal distention and pain. If enteral feeding results in signs of colic it should be decreased to a tolerated level or stopped. This is most commonly seen in foals demonstrating signs of unreadiness for birth, septicemic foals and foals with severe enterocolitis. If enteral feeding cannot meet the foal's energy The suggested feeding rates in the table above are a guide only and should be adjusted according to body weight and condition of the foal. The fi rst day of life the foal should be fed at a minimum 10% of its body weight and slowly increased by 1-2% a day until 20% is reached (i.e. 50 kg foal fed 10% of body weight equals 5000 mL of milk to be consumed over 24 hours). Regular weighing and body condition scoring are essential. Foals should gain approximately 1.3-1.5 kg/day during the fi rst 12 weeks -if satisfactory weight gains are not achieved, veterinary advice should be sought. Ideally parenteral feeding should be delivered through a separate intravenous (jugular) catheter, or a double-or triple-lumen catheter (prevents contamination), but may be delivered through a singlelumen catheter.\n\nMaintenance energy requirements should be calculated, and reached over the fi rst 2-3 days. Calculating energy requirements is not always straightforward as there are no values available specifi cally for neonatal foals. In addition the extra nutritional requirements of sick foals are unknown. The total energy requirement (TER) of a sick 50 kg foal is estimated to be 50-70 kcal/kg/day. One protocol for administration of PN is to start at 33% of TER for 24-48 hours, followed by an increase of 33% over a further 48 hours provided blood glucose measurements are within normal levels. In most cases only partial parenteral nutrition is required as many foals have recovered suffi ciently in a 3-5 day period to commence partial or complete enteral nutrition. Solutions for parenteral nutrition may be purchased commercially and various formulations are available. Two such commercial products are in Tables 4.2 and 4.3 and consist of: Baxter R solution for parenteral nutrition (2 L) \u2022 400 mL 20% lipid (provides 950 kcal) \u2022 800 mL 10% amino acids (provides 256 kcal) \u2022 800 mL 40% glucose (provides 1280 kcal) Given the energy requirements (50-70 kcal/kg/day) of a 50 kg foal the following amounts of this solution would be required for partial and total parenteral nutrition: requirements, total (TPN) or partial parenteral nutrition (PPN) is required. Parenteral nutrition is often avoided due to a perceived diffi culty of administration and expense. However, practitioners who use it frequently would testify to its ease of use and overall economic benefi ts as a result of shortened hospitalization periods. A \"home-made\" solution for partial parenteral nutrition can be compounded from 50% dextrose (1000 mL), 20% lipid (500 mL), and 10% amino acids (2000 mL). This solution is ideal for use in foals with enterocolitis. Dextrose is the cheapest component but providing all of the required calories with dextrose alone would result in an extremely hyperosmolar solution; the administration of which would likely result in phlebitis and glucose intolerance. It is important to remember that foals with severe protein-losing enteropathy are at increased risk for thrombophlebitis due to loss of antithrombin III and the administration of hyperosmolar solutions would increase the risk for developing phlebitis. Strict aseptic technique is required during preparation. Ideally laminar fl ow hoods should be used but if not available careful aseptic mixing may suffi ce. Dextrose and amino acids are mixed fi rst, followed by the lipid to minimize lipid demulsifi cation. A batch is split in half and divided between two separate sterile fl uid bags. The fi rst bag is used immediately and the second can be refrigerated for 24 hours.\n\nBased on the calorifi c content of the above compounded solution the following rates of administration would apply:\n\nWhen choosing whether to use a commercial product or determine a mix for a \"home-made\" solution it is important to bear in mind the disease process involved in the affected foal. Sepsis for example results in glucose intolerance and limits glucose infusion rates. Premature foals have increased demand for protein. These considerations should be taken into account not only for determining the compounding ingredients but also in the timing of monitoring tests.\n\nBlood glucose measurements should be performed every 4-6 hours and be within a range of 80-180 mg/dL. If values fall outside this range adjustments in the rate of crystalloid administration or percentage of dextrose content can be made. If a commercial solution is being used or if for some other reason it is not possible to vary the"}
