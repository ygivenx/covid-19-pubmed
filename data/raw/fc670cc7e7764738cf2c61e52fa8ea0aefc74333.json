{"title": "", "body": "Neutropenic patients and transplant recipients are at risk of a number of life-threatening opportunistic infections. Neither patient group suffers from a single specific immunological deficit, there being a subtle blend of physical and immunological defects which evolve with time. Judgments about management need to be based upon knowledge of the balance of these defects and the timing of the infection.\n\nThe majority of hemato-oncology centers and transplant units base patient management (including that of infection) upon agreed protocols and the evidence base for these has become more robust in recent years. In addition there are now more national and international guidelines on which to base these. It is important that protocols are regularly updated and take account of local variations in risk, organisms and antimicrobial sensitivities.\n\nThe inverse relationship between the numbers of circulating neutrophils and the risk of infection was established more than four decades ago. 1 This effect becomes apparent when the absolute neutrophil count is less than 1.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L. The risk increases considerably as the count falls below 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L and all patients with a count of less than 0.1 \u00d7 10 9 /L for more than 3 weeks have been found to develop an infective episode. 1 Criteria for enrollment in a febrile neutropenia trial usually include a neutrophil count less than 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L.\n\nMost of these patients are neutropenic following chemotherapy for leukemia while some leukemic patients will present with neutropenia before chemotherapy. In addition, the neutrophils of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or leukemia, particularly those with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), may have impaired microbicidal activity. 2, 3 Patients receiving chemotherapy for high-risk or relapsed leukemia may be neutropenic for 2-3 weeks, and longer if receiving regimens containing fludarabine. Those undergoing standard chemotherapy for lymphoma or for solid tumors may also suffer a reduction in circulating neutrophils, but this is rarely less than 0.1 \u00d7 10 9 /L and is often not below 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L with the duration of neutropenia often less than 7 days. In patients with aplastic anemia, or bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients who fail to engraft, neutropenia is often profound and prolonged. Normal engraftment in allogeneic BMT recipients takes place between 2 and 3 weeks after transplantation.\n\nThere has been a steady increase in the numbers of peripheral blood stem cell transplants (PBSCT) performed in Europe and autologous PBSCT has virtually replaced autologous bone marrow transplantation. Autologous PBSCT recipients have a shorter duration of neutropenia.\n\nPatients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation behave essentially like neutropenic patients during the early post-transplant phase, but remain immunosuppressed for up to 2 years, even without complications such as graftversus-host disease (GVHD).\n\nOther causes of neutropenia are shown in Box 40.1. \n\nThe pathogenesis of infection in these patients is multifactorial and is often the consequence of a breach in the skin or oral mucosa plus defects in cellular or humoral immunity.\n\nSome defects are associated with specific infections (Table 40.1) . Lymphopenia, as a consequence of lymphoid malignancy or treatment, is associated with reactivation of intracellular organisms such as mycobacteria, the herpes viruses, Toxoplasma gondii and Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly Pneumocystis carinii). Patients with chronic lymphoid malignancies and those receiving immunosuppressive chemotherapy, such as BMT recipients, have impaired antibody production which predisposes to infection with encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. The use of indwelling central venous catheters and mucosal damage caused by chemotherapy and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection 4 allows penetration by commensal flora. In recent years changes in cytotoxic chemotherapy have rendered the oropharynx a major portal of entry for \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci. Likewise, splenectomy undertaken as treatment or for diagnosis renders the patient susceptible to infection with encapsulated organisms such as Str. pneumoniae. Others have pre-existing sites of chronic infection such as middle-ear disease or bronchiectasis, which may act as reservoirs of infection with organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ethnic origin and foreign travel may increase exposure to infections such as tuberculosis, malaria or strongyloidiasis.\n\nBetween 30% and 50% of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients can be confirmed microbiologically, and of these, most are due to bacteremia. Infections with Gram-positive bacteria, especially the coagulase-negative staphylococci and \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci, have increased in frequency over the past two decades. In the EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) participatory centers the incidence of bacteremia due to Gram-positive organisms increased from 29% 5 to 67% during the 1970s and 1980s. 6 This increase correlates with the escalating use of central venous catheters, the development of alternative high-dose chemotherapy with attendant mucositis, and better prevention of Gram-negative infections. However, subsequent trials have shown a fall again, possibly associated with the decline in quinolone prophylaxis usage associated with emerging resistance. Of recent interest is the finding that cell-wall deficient (mostly Gram-positive) bacteria may be responsible for up to 25% of episodes of neutropenic fever in BMT recipients. 7 Gram-negative bacteria continue to cause some of the most serious episodes of sepsis. Infections caused by the Enterobacteriaceae and Ps. aeruginosa carry a mortality of 40-60%. 8, 9 Oropharyngeal candidosis is extremely common in patients not receiving prophylaxis, while invasive candidosis and aspergillosis account for 20-30% of fatal infections when treating acute leukemia. 10, 11 Invasive aspergillosis is the most important infective cause of death in childhood acute myeloid leukemia 12 \n\nAllogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients are at risk of a wide range of infections based upon extent of exposure and degree of immunosuppression. Autologous HSCT recipients are also at risk of infection although to a lesser degree due to shorter periods of neutropenia and time to engraftment. However, patients receiving CD34-enriched autografts appear to be at a similar level of risk as allogeneic HSCT recipients for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and other opportunistic infections. 13 These risks are summarized in Box 40.3.\n\nPrevention of these serious infections has been the goal of clinicians for many years. Strategies for preventing acquisition of organisms, such as the provision of a low microbial diet, or the use of high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration, appear important in some profoundly neutropenic patients at risk from aspergillosis and have been increasingly emphasized in recent years. 14 The infections to which these HSCT recipients are most vulnerable can be temporally categorized into three periods following transplantation: \u2022 Pre-engraftment -less than 3 weeks \u2022 Immediate postengraftment -3 weeks to 3 months \u2022 Late postengraftment -more than 3 months. These periods, pathogens, immune defects and associated host factors in HSCT recipients are illustrated in Figure 40 \n\nVarious trials have examined the efficacy of oral non-absorbable antibiotics. Although a number of these were flawed, several controlled trials showed a benefit only when they were combined with a protective environment. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Although trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was first used in patients with acute leukemia to prevent Pn. jirovecii pneumonitis, it also reduced the incidence of bacterial infection. 24 Further studies demonstrated the greatest benefit in patients with prolonged neutropenia, where a reduction in Gram-negative bacterial infections was seen. [25] [26] [27] [28] However, the incidence of side effects (including bone marrow suppression) and the selection of multiresistant organisms led to a decline in its use for this indication.\n\nOral quinolones are currently the most commonly used prophylactic antibacterial agents in adult patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Initially oral quinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin) were compared in a number of studies with placebo, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and non-absorbable antibiotics. In the majority of these the 4-quinolone treated patients had significantly fewer Gram-negative bacterial infections, a delayed onset of fever and a reduction in the number of days of fever. Importantly, a reduction in mortality was not demonstrated. 29 There has been concern that quinolone resistance is increasing in some units 30 and this has led to the discontinuation of quinolone prophylaxis. However, initial meta-analysis did not show this to be a significant problem, and recent EORTC and Health Protection Agency (HPA) data further support these findings. A sequential study has shown that combining ciprofloxacin with colistin was associated with no significant change in quinolone resistance over a 12-year period. 31 However, a more recent meta-analysis 32 that evaluated 95 randomized trials in afebrile neutropenic patients (the majority of whom had hematological malignancies) comparing antibiotic prophylaxis with placebo, no intervention or with another antibiotic class has shown a significant reduction in the risk for death when compared with placebo or no treatment (relative risk [RR], 0.67). The survival benefit was more substantial when the analysis was limited to fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinolone prophylaxis reduced the risk for all-cause mortality (RR 0.52, 95% CI, 0.35-0.77), as well as infectionrelated mortality, fever, clinically documented infections and microbiologically documented infections. Although there was no significant increase in resistant bacteria with fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, the length of observation may have been insufficient to detect the emergence of resistant bacteria. All prophylactic antibiotics were associated with an increased risk for adverse events.\n\nFollowing on from this meta-analysis, two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of levofloxacin prophylaxis in neutropenic patients undergoing chemotherapy were performed. 33, 34 Levofloxacin has similar activity against Gramnegative bacteria in comparison with ciprofloxacin, with the exception of pseudomonads; however, it has improved activity against certain Gram-positive pathogens, including streptococci. The first trial evaluated levofloxacin prophylaxis from the initiation of chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery, in higher-risk, mainly inpatient adult leukaemic or stem cell transplant patients in whom chemotherapy-induced neutropenia was expected to last for more than 7 days. The second trial was in the outpatient setting and evaluated levofloxacin prophylaxis after chemotherapy for solid tumors and lymphomas for patients anticipated to have periods of neutropenia of 7 days or less. The effects of prophylaxis were similar between both patient groups in the two trials, as were mortality and tolerability. Both trials failed to demonstrate a significant survival benefit with prophylaxis. The results reflected previous meta-analyses and a review of both trials demonstrated that the numbers needed to treat to prevent one death by any cause was 24 in all patients and 43 in patients with an expected duration of neutropenia of >7 days.\n\nThe decision whether to use antibiotic prophylaxis and the selection of agent is a fine balance between calculated risk and expected benefit. Risks to consider include associations between fluoroquinolone use and severe Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), adverse drug reactions, antibiotic resistance, and whether prophylaxis will preclude the use of quinolones in empirical therapy of neutropenic fever in those patients stratified as low risk. The benefit of prophylactic antibiotics in other patient subsets with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia remains controversial.\n\nWith regard to timing and length of prophylaxis, guidelines from the European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL) suggest it should start with chemotherapy and continue until resolution of neutropenia or initiation of empirical antibacterial therapy for febrile neutropenia.\n\nThe problem of Gram-positive infections, particularly those due to \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci, has been addressed by a number of studies using different agents, including oral penicillins, 35 macrolides 36,37 and rifampicin (rifampin). 38 However, these have given mixed results and have been associated with the emergence of resistance. It is difficult, therefore, to make recommendations for prophylaxis of Gram-positive pathogens other than to use levofloxacin which has been shown to be of benefit. Some centers advocate prophylaxis against pneumococcal infection in allogeneic HSCT recipients, functionally asplenic patients and in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy for GVHD. Where pneumococcal isolates have intermediate to high-level resistance rates to penicillin approaching 35%, alternative agents should be considered based on local susceptibility patterns. Trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole prophylaxis for Pn. jirovecii is likely to be protective against pneumococcal disease.\n\nAttempts at antifungal prophylaxis have met with variable success. Initial studies examined oral polyenes. Nystatin, in doses up to 12 \u00d7 10 6 units per day, had little effect on the incidence of invasive candidosis in neutropenic patients, 11 whereas amphotericin B was superior to placebo in preventing the disease. 39 While most invasive candidal infections are thought to gain entry via the gut, 39 non-absorbable antifungal agents do not protect against fungal infections at other sites, namely the skin, intravenous catheter sites and the respiratory tract. The oral, systemically active azoles have the potential to control colonization as well as prevent dissemination. \n\nKetoconazole reduces yeast carriage and the incidence of both local and systemic candidosis compared with placebo or non-absorbable agents. 39 Absorption is impaired in neutropenic patients, particularly in BMT recipients, 40 and breakthrough infections have occurred. 41 Ketoconazole also causes elevated ciclosporin A levels as a result of activity on hepatic P 450 enzymes and serious idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity.\n\nFluconazole reduces colonization, mucosal thrush and the number of disseminated yeast infections. 42, 43 Two placebocontrolled studies in HSCT recipients showed a significant reduction in invasive fungal infections (IFI). 44, 45 Fluconazole was associated with a reduced mortality, 45 and fluconazole prophylaxis reduced the incidence of IFI, overall mortality and empirical antifungal therapy in allogeneic HSCT recipients but not autologous HSCT recipients. Unfortunately, its use in some centers has been associated with an increase in colonization and infection with Candida krusei, which is intrinsically resistant to fluconazole. 46 Fluconazole is also inactive against the important invasive molds that affect this population, especially Aspergillus spp. and the zygomycetes.\n\nIn contrast, itraconazole has activity against the molds, particularly Aspergillus spp. (see Ch. 32). However, in its original capsule formulation it was poorly absorbed in HSCT patients. This has been overcome by the introduction of an itraconazole-cyclodextrin complex in solution. Meta-analysis has shown this formulation to be associated with a lower overall incidence of fungal infection, lower mortality from fungal infection and a reduction in the use of intravenous amphotericin for suspected invasive fungal infection than fluconazole, oral amphotericin and placebo. [47] [48] [49] There was also a reduction in the incidence of invasive aspergillosis.\n\nIn a randomized trial involving neutropenic patients with AML or MDS, prophylaxis with posaconazole led to a decrease in IFI due to aspergillosis and reduced overall mortality compared with the comparator group receiving fluconazole or itraconazole prophylaxis. 50 A similar effect was shown in allogeneic HSCT patients with GVHD. 51 However, posaconazole prophylaxis has not been evaluated to date in allogeneic HSCT recipients in the neutropenic period post conditioning. Voriconazole has been used in prophylaxis, although large trial data of its use in this setting are still awaited. Extended-spectrum triazole prophylaxis should be avoided in patients receiving vinca alkaloid-based chemotherapy regimens such as vincristine in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In these cases amphotericin regimens or an echinocandin could be considered.\n\nMicafungin, an echinocandin, is approved for prophylaxis of candidal infections in patients undergoing HSCT. In a randomized, double-blind trial of neutropenic autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients, comparing 50 mg per day of micafungin with 400 mg per day of fluconazole for antifungal prophylaxis, micafungin was superior to fluconazole based on the absence of breakthrough fungal infection. 52 In the absence of trial data it would be appropriate to recommend that prophylaxis continue until absolute neutrophil counts are above 0.5 \u00d7 10 9 /L in chemotherapy patients. In allogeneic HSCT there is an argument for continuing prophylaxis until at least day +75 or until the end of immunosuppression (in the case of supervening GVHD).\n\nAmphotericin administered as a nasal spray has produced conflicting results in preventing invasive aspergillosis, 53, 54 although some studies have shown greater benefit when it is aerosolized. 55, 56 One study showed no significant difference in proven, probable or possible invasive aspergillosis between aerosolized amphotericin and no inhalation (4% vs 7%). 57 Prophylaxis against Pn. jirovecii infection has proved remarkably effective in those undergoing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 24 and for the first 6 months post-BMT. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole three times weekly has been most studied, although some units are now using a 2-day regimen. Nebulized pentamidine is often used during marrow engraftment to avoid the myelosuppressive effects of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, although data suggest that it may be inferior when used prophylactically in allogeneic transplant recipients. Other alternatives include dapsone and atovaquone.\n\nMost virus infections in the neutropenic patient are due to reactivation of the human herpes viruses. Up to 80% of adult patients with leukemia are herpes simplex virus (HSV) seropositive and the incidence of HSV infection among HSV-seropositive HSCT recipients is about 80%. HSV infection in patients with leukemia is subsequent to reactivation of latent virus in most cases.\n\nAciclovir (acyclovir), 200 mg every 8 h to 800 mg every 12 h, is effective as prophylaxis against HSV infection in HSVseropositive patients with leukemia undergoing chemotherapy or in BMT recipients. 58, 59 An alternative regimen is valaciclovir 500 mg every 12 h.\n\nChemoprophylaxis against CMV infection, defined as the use of antiviral agents to prevent a primary CMV infection or a CMV reactivation, has been investigated in detail only in HSCT recipients, although CMV disease also occurs in patients with acute leukemia receiving chemotherapy. Allogeneic HSCT recipients comprise the group at highest risk of CMV reactivation and disease.\n\nHigh-dose aciclovir has been shown to be partially effective in preventing CMV infection and disease post-BMT. A multicenter randomized trial compared 500 mg/m 2 intravenously every 8 h for 1 month followed by 800 mg every 6 h by mouth for 6 months with 200 or 400 mg every 6 h orally for 1 month followed by placebo. 60 The incidence of CMV infection reduced and survival increased by day 210 post-BMT, although the rates of CMV pneumonia were similar in the two groups. Valaciclovir is also being used in this setting.\n\nThe use of ganciclovir as prophylaxis against CMV infection has shown some benefit in reducing the incidence of CMV disease but has no effect on survival during the first 4 months post-BMT. 42, 61 Pre-emptive therapy, defined as the use of antiviral agents in an asymptomatic patient with CMV detected by a screening assay, includes ganciclovir, valganciclovir and foscarnet. The choice depends on the risk of toxicity and which antiviral drugs have been used previously. Weekly monitoring in allogeneic HSCT recipients using a CMV antigenemia assay or a technique for detection of either CMV DNA or RNA is of use for the pre-emptive management of CMV infection. 62, 63 Centers vary with regard to the cut-off value used after which therapy is commenced and studies are in progress to better define this. When ganciclovir has been used as pre-emptive therapy following detection of CMV infection, survival was improved at 100 and 180 days post-transplant. 64 Foscarnet may be considered for second-line pre-emptive therapy, or in combination. Cidofovir can be considered for secondline pre-emptive therapy (3-5 mg/kg) but careful monitoring of renal function is required. Other therapeutic options in patients with multiresistant CMV disease are leflunomide and artesunate; however, experience with these agents is very limited.\n\nTo date there is no evidence to support the use of prophylaxis for other human herpesvirus (HHV) infections such as HHV-6 following HSCT.\n\nA summary of prophylactic regimens is shown in Table 40 .2.\n\nThe use of empirical antibiotic therapy in febrile neutropenic patients is almost universally practiced, because to await microbiological diagnosis is associated with a high mortality, particularly in patients with Gram-negative bacteremia. The trigger for this is usually a single oral temperature of 38.3\u00b0C or two separate temperatures of 38.0\u00b0C at least 1 h apart.\n\nThe regimen chosen should be active against the common organisms likely to result in overwhelming sepsis or death, and influenced by local antibiotic sensitivity patterns, the incidence of particular infections, the specific needs of the patient and the prophylactic regimen used. Traditionally the significant organisms have been the Enterobacteriaceae and Ps. aeruginosa, which carry a mortality of 40-60%. 8, 9 Earlier regimens included an aminoglycoside in combination with a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic in an attempt to achieve broadspectrum and synergistic activity against organisms such as Ps. aeruginosa. Aminoglycoside use carries the inherent risk of renal and ototoxicity, and data for its combination with \u03b2-lactams in empirical therapy have been conflicting. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend aminoglycosides in patients at high risk of pseudomonal infections (history of previous pseudomonal infections or the presence of ecthyma gangrenosum) whereas Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines suggest they may be added in cases of progressive infection or documented resistant Gram-negative infection. A Cochrane review of 68 randomized controlled trials 65 concluded that for the primary outcome measure of all-cause mortality, there was no significant difference between monotherapy and combination (RR = 0.85). For the second outcome measure of treatment failure there was an advantage to monotherapy in 37 trials comparing different \u03b2-lactams (this was for patients with documented infection or hematological malignancy) (RR = 0.86). There was no difference between the two comparator arms in the number of superinfections but significantly more adverse events in the combination group for nephrotoxicity. Another meta-analysis also concluded that monotherapy is as effective as aminoglycoside-\u03b2-lactam combinations. 66 Data from patients in non-neutropenic studies have shown that once-daily dosing aminoglycoside regimens are as efficacious as multiple-dose regimens.\n\nThe first studies of double \u03b2-lactam therapy gave results inferior to aminoglycoside-containing regimens, 5,67,68 but later studies using ceftazidime, latamoxef and cefoperazone in combination with a ureidopenicillin [69] [70] [71] concluded that such combinations were of equal efficacy and less nephrotoxic than aminoglycoside-containing regimens. However, it was unclear whether they were any better than \u03b2-lactam monotherapy. A number of antibiotic regimens have subsequently been evaluated for empirical therapy in febrile neutropenic patients [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] and are listed in Box 40.4.\n\nThere have been reports that Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is selected out by the carbapenems, to which it is intrinsically resistant. 78 In addition, there have been concerns over central nervous system (CNS) toxicity with high-dose imipenem 71 or in patients receiving ciprofloxacin prophylaxis. 79 One advantage of the carbapenems is their activity against the \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci, 80 allowing them to be used alone without the need for early glycopeptide therapy. Similar streptococcal activity can be provided by piperacillin-tazobactam. 81 A recent meta-analysis of randomized trials examining the choice of \u03b2-lactam agent as empirical therapy for the treatment of febrile neutropenia reported that cefepime was associated with an increase in all-cause mortality but not with an increase in infection-related mortality. 82 The authors have concluded that ceftazidime, imipenem, meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam are suitable monotherapy agents.\n\nThe high incidence of Gram-positive infections suggests that empirical therapy should contain a broad-spectrum anti-Gram-positive agent. Clinical trials of glycopeptides have provided conflicting evidence as to whether and when to add such an agent.\n\nEarly studies in centers in which there were significant numbers of Gram-positive infections showed that initial vancomycin or teicoplanin increased response rates and reduced morbidity, 83, 84 although no study showed a reduction in mortality. In addition, vancomycin is associated with increased toxicity. 84, 85 A large joint study conducted by the EORTC and the National Cancer Institute of Canada showed that including vancomycin in the initial therapy conferred no additional benefit, 86 and this has been reinforced by a meta-analysis showing no benefit of empirical Gram-positive therapy either initially or for persistent fever. 87 The increasing isolation of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) 88, 89 prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue guidelines on the use of vancomycin that specifically excluded its use as empirical therapy in the neutropenic patient. This seemed prudent, although the IDSA suggests that vancomycin may be used in initial regimens in institutions where fulminant Gram-positive infections are common, particularly where MRSA may be a problem, and discontinued 3-4 days later if such an infection is not identified. 90 There is also evidence that the choice of broad-spectrum agent for empirical therapy can influence the emergence of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE). 91 At present glycopeptide-intermediate Staph. aureus (GISA) infections are not a significant problem in the UK, but provide another reason for selective use of glycopeptides in institutions where they do occur.\n\nThe oxazolidinone linezolid, the streptogramin quinupristin-dalfopristin and daptomycin are alternatives in patients intolerant of vancomycin and teicoplanin and for treatment of GRE and GISA infections. A multicenter, randomized study of febrile neutropenic patients comparing the safety of linezolid and vancomycin showed that clinical success rates 7 days after completion of therapy were equivalent, as was mortality at 16 days after completion of therapy. Drug adverse events were more frequent in the vancomycin arm and time to defervescence was shorter in the linezolid arm in patients with documented Gram-positive infections. Slower times to neutrophil recovery seen in the linezolid arm may have been secondary to the myelosuppressive effects of linezolid but were not statistically significant.\n\nThe duration of treatment has not been studied independently, but since the first EORTC trial the evidence has suggested that prolonged treatment is associated with more superinfections, often fungal, but no improvement in outcome. Current EORTC trials are conducted on the basis of discontinuing antibiotics after 7 days minimum treatment and four consecutive afebrile days, and this is similar to the IDSA and NCCN guidelines where 5-7 days without fever is recommended. 90 Options are summarized in Table 40 .3.\n\nWith health services moving towards earlier discharge of all groups of patients, attempts have been made to achieve this in the neutropenic population. Talcott and colleagues derived a risk assessment model in which patients were divided into four groups. 92 The fourth group was found to be at low risk and was studied in subsequent trials, which showed that amoxicillin-clavulanate plus ciprofloxacin was as effective as intravenous ceftazidime or ceftriaxone plus amikacin in treating these patients. 93, 94 Examples of outpatient oral/intravenous regimens are included in Box 40.4.\n\nApproximately 20-30% of febrile patients who remain persistently neutropenic fail to respond to apparently appropriate antibiotic therapy. Some remain febrile until recovery of their neutrophil counts, irrespective of the antimicrobial therapy administered. Many patients with persistent fever will have an occult fungal infection. Patients with acute leukemia and allogeneic HSCT recipients are at highest risk due to prolonged neutropenia and immunosuppression for GVHD. Autopsy studies have shown that up to 25% of those neutropenic patients who die have an undiagnosed fungal infection. 10 In view of the difficulties in diagnosis, the use of empirical antifungal therapy has been advocated. Recent ECIL 2009 guidelines are consistent with this viewpoint and current British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) guidelines advocate empirical antifungal therapy where IFI is suspected in conjunction with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning and mycological tests (see Ch. 60). The main randomized study on which empirical antifungal therapy is based compared the effect of amphotericin (0.6 mg/kg per day or equivalent) with no treatment in patients remaining febrile 4 days after empirical therapy. 95 Although more responded in the amphotericin-treated group, the effect was only significant in patients not given antifungal prophylaxis (78% vs 45%; p = 0.04). Following this a number of other agents have been shown to be at least as effective as conventional amphotericin. Liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome) is less nephrotoxic than conventional amphotericin, at least as effective in rendering patients afebrile and is associated with significantly fewer breakthrough fungal infections. 96, 97 Subsequently, caspofungin has been shown to be at least as effective as AmBisome in this setting. 97 Patients who deteriorate during the first 48 h of empirical therapy pose a particularly difficult therapeutic challenge. It is important that there are no gaps in the spectrum of the selected regimen. Deterioration may be due to Gram-negative or Gram-positive organisms, such as \u03b1-hemolytic streptococci, which may cause features similar to those of sepsis syndrome (including acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock), or enterococci. Gram-negative activity (including antipseudomonal activity) is essential. Consequently, the addition of an aminoglycoside to initial \u03b2-lactam monotherapy is recommended, and this is also supported by the ECIL guidelines for patients with septic shock. A glycopeptide should also be considered. The above approach is summarized in Figure 40 .2.\n\nMost neutropenic patients undergoing chemotherapy have an indwelling central line, which commonly becomes infected. The predominant pathogens are coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staph. aureus. 98 Others include Candida spp., coryneforms, Acinetobacter, Stenotrophomonas and Pseudomonas spp. 99 Ideally, infected catheters should be removed, but coagulasenegative staphylococcal infections may be effectively suppressed or eliminated by administering antibiotics via the catheter until neutropenia has resolved. 98 Fig. 40.2 An algorithm for the initial management of febrile neutropenic patients receiving prophylaxis.\n\nA glycopeptide (most frequently vancomycin) is given for these, with the chance of successful resolution of bacteremia and fever being more than 50%. Similar response rates can be obtained with coryneform infections but those due to Candida spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Staph. aureus, Ps. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Sten. maltophilia, non-tuberculous mycobacteria, and any form of tunnel infection, require the catheter to be removed and appropriate antimicrobial therapy administered. 100 The presence of port infection or septic phlebitis in association with long-term indwelling catheters are also indications for catheter removal and antimicrobial therapy.\n\nPulmonary infiltrates commonly occur in the febrile neutropenic patient and have a number of causes, especially in the BMT recipient. These include non-infective conditions such as pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, adverse drug reactions, radiation injury and the idiopathic pneumonitis syndrome. Focal lesions are more indicative of fungal infection, and HRCT or MRI scanning may reveal characteristic features of these. 101 If clinical status permits, the causative organism(s) may be obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage. However, in many cases treatment has to be given empirically. Initial therapy should certainly include agents effective against common respiratory pathogens such as Str. pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, as well as Gram-negative organisms including Ps. aeruginosa, and hence a carbapenem, piperacillin-tazobactam or ceftazidime, with or without an aminoglycoside, is recommended.\n\nAtypical pneumonias are extremely uncommon in this population and, unless there are particular clinical or epidemiological reasons to suggest Legionnaires' disease, erythromycin can be omitted from the initial therapy unless the infection appears to be community related. Mycobacterial infections may occasionally complicate hematological malignancies. Patients with lymphoid malignancy and BMT recipients who have not been receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis are at risk of Pn. jirovecii pneumonitis; empirical high-dose trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole therapy (120 mg/kg per day in divided doses) is warranted in such patients. BMT recipients are particularly at risk of CMV pneumonitis post-transplant. However, CMV or Pn. jirovecii pneumonitis usually presents a month or so posttransplant, when the patient is no longer neutropenic, and the timing of the presentation should be taken into account when decisions are being made regarding empirical therapy. CMV pneumonitis is treated with intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg every 12 h) plus intravenous immunoglobulin (200-400 mg/kg on alternate days for 14-21 days). [102] [103] [104] Despite this, mortality from CMV pneumonitis is still in excess of 50% in BMT recipients. Furthermore, the myelosuppressive effect of ganciclovir can present a particular problem in these patients.\n\nPatients discharged into the community are at risk of respiratory viral infections with agents such as respiratory syncytial virus, influenza and paramyxoviruses, which occasionally cause outbreaks on hematology units. 105 \n\nDespite recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections (IFI), failure rates approach 50% in invasive aspergillosis. Case fatality rates of 87% for HSCT and 50% for leukemia patients are quoted, 106 with 30-day mortality rates of 45% for candidemia in hematological malignancy. 107 Current BCSH guidelines advocate the use of caspofungin and liposomal amphotericin for empirical therapy of suspected IFI as they have the lowest rates of toxicity and are of equal efficacy. This is also in keeping with the current ECIL guidelines. Other options include voriconazole and posaconazole. The therapy of fungal infection is considered in detail in Chapter 60.\n\nA trend towards non-albicans species such as C. glabrata and C. krusei displaying a decreased susceptibility or resistance to azoles has been documented in both Europe and North America. These species are responsible for more than 60% of invasive candidal infections in patients with hematological malignancy. 108 Recent trials of the three licensed echinocandins -caspofungin, micafungin and anidulafungin -have demonstrated response rates in excess of 70% and these are now considered to be among the first-line agents for invasive candidal infections, especially where the species is not known, where the patient has received azole prophylaxis or in severe sepsis. This is supported by the ECIL-2 guideline update and IDSA candida guidelines, together with the use of AmBisome and other lipid formulations of amphotericin. Voriconazole is an alternative agent but should be used with care in patients where previous azole prophylaxis has been used. Recommendations for duration of therapy consist of 14 days following the last positive blood culture, together with extensive investigation for dissemination of infection. Further trials regarding the use of efungumab (Mycograb), a human recombinant antibody consisting of an Fv fragment that binds to the domain structure HSP90 of Candida spp., are needed before recommendations regarding its use in combination with antifungals can be made, and it is currently not licensed.\n\nMortality due to invasive aspergillosis remains high in neutropenic patients; the infection is now the most important cause of death in childhood AML and adult BMT recipients. In BMT recipients case fatality rates are as high as 87%. 106 Successful outcome is dependent upon early treatment and, to a considerable extent, on bone marrow recovery. Agents active against Aspergillus spp. include amphotericin deoxycholate and its lipid-associated preparations, the extended-spectrum triazoles and echinocandins. High-dose conventional amphotericin is also associated with a high incidence of nephrotoxicity. Lipidassociated formulations of the drug have been licensed for use in patients failing treatment or experiencing unacceptable toxicity with conventional amphotericin. Liposomal amphotericin (AmBisome) has been studied in a randomized prospective trial comparing two doses (1 mg/kg per day and 4 mg/kg per day) for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic patients: 109 6-month mortality was approximately 60% with attributable mortality of around 20% in the two arms. A double-blind comparison of AmBisome 3 mg/kg and AmBisome 10 mg/kg in primary therapy by Cornely and colleagues demonstrated no additional benefit of 10 mg/kg dosing over 3 mg/kg dosing of liposomal amphotericin B. 110 Voriconazole has been assessed by Denning and colleagues in two open-labeled studies in which response rates of 44% and 48% were reported, respectively. 111, 112 Superiority of voriconazole over amphotericin deoxycholate in terms of efficacy, safety and survival has been demonstrated by Herbrecht and colleagues in a randomized trial. 112 Superiority was irrespective of the host group, site of lesion or neutropenic status. Voriconazole has been given the highest graded recommendation in the recent ECIL-2 guideline update, followed by AmBisome. In North America the NCCN currently recommends voriconazole as the agent of choice for first-line therapy of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. There are insufficient data to recommend the use of caspofungin, itraconazole and posaconazole as agents in firstline therapy of invasive aspergillosis, but these have all been used in salvage therapy with similar efficacy. There are also currently insufficient data to recommend combination therapy in first-line therapy. One retrospective study 113 comparing the combination of voriconazole and caspofungin given as salvage therapy after failure of amphotericin formulations in allogeneic HSCT recipients with voriconazole monotherapy in a historical control group demonstrated substantially improved 3-month survival.\n\nThe development of mycotic lung sequestra (which have been mistakenly termed mycetomas) may require additional therapy. These lesions appear once the bone marrow is regenerating. Patients are at risk of life-threatening hemoptysis. 114 In addition, patients who require further chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation are at considerable risk of relapse of the original infection. Resection of these lesions has been shown to be effective, preventing relapse following bone marrow transplantation, and is associated with a lower mortality than antifungal therapy alone in some studies, 115 although there are no large randomized studies in this setting.\n\nHematopoietic growth factors have been extensively used to treat neutropenic patients. Studies have consistently shown that granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) reduces the duration of neutropenia. However, the reduction in infectious complications has been modest and most trials have been unable to demonstrate a reduction in infectious morbidity and mortality. [116] [117] [118] This is probably because the major effect of G-CSF is to accelerate the recovery of neutrophils, whereas it has no impact on the critical lag period of profound neutropenia. 119 The American Society of Oncology and the NCCN have published guidelines for the use of these agents in the setting of anti-cancer chemotherapy.\n\nGranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) may be beneficial in the treatment of invasive fungal infections, 120 although large-scale trials demonstrating this are regrettably still lacking.\n\nRenewed interest is now being shown in this modality, coupled with improved methods of harvesting and increased yield following the use of growth factors. 121, 122 \n\nRoutine prophylactic use of intravenous immunoglobulin does not reduce viral infections; however, the addition of intravenous immunoglobulin to ganciclovir may improve survival in CMV pneumonitis and post-exposure immunoglobulin is indicated for the prevention of hepatitis A, measles and varicella-zoster infection.\n\nSince the first successful human cadaveric kidney transplant in 1954, solid organ transplantation has proceeded to become a viable option in the management of end-organ failure worldwide. Current 1-and 5-year graft survival for cadaveric (nonextended criteria donor) renal transplants in the USA is 95% and 82%, respectively. 123 The results are similar for Europe. Developments in surgery and better control of rejection and infective complications have allowed a steady improvement in the survival of other organ grafts.\n\nMost transplant units use a triple regimen of azathioprine or mycophenolate, a calcineurin inhibitor such as ciclosporin A, and corticosteroids for immunosuppression. Azathioprine is a purine analog which inhibits both B-and T-cell proliferation; as a consequence, both cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and humoral immunity are inhibited. The drug may take weeks or months to exert its full effect. Ciclosporin, a calcineurin inhibitor, arrests the lymphocyte cell cycle in the resting phase, having most effect on CD4-positive T cells and a minimal effect on B cells. This results in effective suppression of CMI, has little effect on humoral immunity and no effect on phagocytosis. The inflammatory response is preserved.\n\nCorticosteroids in high dose have a very broad immunosuppressive action, producing a reduction in antigen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation and a blunting of the primary antibody response. They also inhibit neutrophil chemotaxis and monocyte phagocytosis, dramatically reducing inflammatory responses at high dosage and disguising the presence of infection.\n\nThe aim of these regimens is to achieve a balance between graft rejection and risk of infection. Episodes of subsequent acute rejection require considerable immunosuppression and are accompanied by an increased risk of opportunistic infections. The phase of acute rejection varies in length for different transplants. Most episodes occur in the first 3 months of liver transplantation, whereas the phase of acute rejection lasts for 6 months for renal transplants. 124 Rejection episodes are usually treated with high-dose methylprednisolone or various antibody preparations such as polyclonal antithymocyte globulin (ATG), antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) or the pan-T-cell monoclonal antibody OKT3. Patients requiring a second or third graft are usually even more immunosuppressed and at increased risk of opportunistic infection.\n\nTacrolimus (FK506), another calcineurin antagonist, has been substituted for ciclosporin for certain indications; several studies have demonstrated it to have fewer infective complications, [125] [126] [127] [128] which may be a consequence of the need for less episodic antirejection therapy. Mycophenolate mofetil, an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase which inhibits purine synthesis, has been used as a substitute for calcineurin inhibitors. Although it has no associated renal toxicity (and allows improvement in renal function), some studies have shown it to result in increased risk of rejection. 124 A recent review comparing the use of azathioprine with mycophenolate in liver transplantation concluded that, to date, little if any clinical benefit could be observed of mycophenolate mofetil over azathioprine. 129 There is still considerable scope for refining immunosuppression with these and other new agents, hopefully enabling a further reduction in infective complications.\n\nThe risk of infection in the organ transplant patient is influenced by previous epidemiological exposures and the degree of immunosuppression. Epidemiological exposures can be divided into donor-derived infections, recipient-derived infections, nosocomial infections and community infections. The extent of immunosuppression is determined by the type of immunosuppressive therapy, its dose and duration (see Box 40.5) , underlying diseases and co-morbid conditions, the presence of devitalized tissues or fluid collections in the transplanted organ, and the presence of invasive devices. Other important factors include concomitant infection with immunomodulating viruses such as CMV and other human herpes viruses, HIV-1, and hepatitis B and C viruses. Infectious complications follow a relatively predictable chronological order after any transplantation procedure. Knowledge of this is helpful in guiding the use and duration of prophylaxis, establishing a diagnosis through appropriate investigations and administering empirical treatment if necessary. This is summarized in Figure 40 .3.\n\nIn the first month after transplant, infections are largely associated with the transplant surgical procedure, particularly those complicating the anastomoses associated with the specific procedure. Some infections are transmitted with the allograft or are present in the recipient before transplantation. An important component of the pretransplant evaluation is to recognize and treat such infections. Nosocomial infections such as those due to VRE or MRSA, and Clostridium difficile colitis are also important at this time.\n\nBetween the first and the sixth month following transplantation the most important infections are caused by the herpes group viruses (especially CMV), Nocardia species, Listeria monocytogenes, Toxoplasma gondii, Pn. jirovecii and other fungi. In addition, latent infections such as tuberculosis or histoplasmosis may reactivate at this time. The risk of infection correlates with the severity of immunosuppression required to treat rejection episodes.\n\nSubsequent infections are usually the result of communityacquired organisms. A few patients will suffer chronic viral infections affecting the graft, while others who have been intensively immunosuppressed remain at risk of opportunistic infections. Other rare infections in the late post-transplant period have been described, including chronic infection with hepatitis E virus causing cirrhosis as a late complication. 130 \n\nBacterial infections occur in approximately 50% of renal transplant recipients and in up to 70% of liver transplant patients. In some series patients have suffered at least one bacterial infection in the post-transplant period. 131 The common infections are intra-abdominal abscess, cholangitis, bacteremia, wound infection, lower respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection, with intra-abdominal infection responsible for approximately 30% in liver transplantation. [131] [132] [133] [134] The overall mortality is less than 5%, but varies according to site and organ.\n\nSubsequently resistant organisms have become established as endemic pathogens in many transplant units. MRSA was found to be the leading cause of bacteremia in liver transplant recipients in one center, responsible for 37% of all episodes. 135 VRE and extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase-producing Gramnegative organisms are also increasingly causing infections in these patients.\n\nRepresentative organisms isolated from infected patients in the postoperative period are shown in Box 40.6. Bacteria isolated from the graft perfusion fluid differ in their propensity to cause post-transplantation infection. Positive cultures have been found in up to 40% of cases in renal transplantation, but most of these have been due to Grampositive skin bacteria and do not seem to have serious consequences. However, the isolation of the Enterobacteriaceae and Ps. aeruginosa correlate with vascular infection and postoperative sepsis, [136] [137] [138] and warrant systemic antibiotic therapy following transplantation.\n\nInfections due to Nocardia spp. are important late complications following transplantation, usually occurring after the first month, and which correlate with the degree of immunosuppression. Outbreaks in renal transplant units have been described 139 and the incidence is up to 4% in this group.\n\nTuberculosis tends to occur several months after transplantation. The onset is significantly later in renal transplants than in other groups of organ transplant recipients. 140 Approximately one-third have disseminated infection and the overall mortality is 29%. The overall incidence of mycobacterial infection in the transplant population is 1%, more than 50-fold greater than the incidence in the general population. 141 Transplant recipients are at increased risk of Legionnaires' disease by virtue of their immunosuppression. In addition, a UK study demonstrated that Legionella spp. could be isolated from the water in approximately 50% of transplant units 142 and Legionella control is now an important component of water and air conditioning management in hospitals.\n\nColonization with yeasts is common in this population, although the incidence varies according to the number and frequency of sites sampled and the use of antifungal prophylaxis. Infection rates vary, with the lowest in renal transplant recipients (approximately 5%). 143 The incidence of fungal infections is falling, possibly as a consequence of reduced immunosuppression and improvement in surgical technique. 144 Most infections are caused by Candida spp. (approximately 80%), with Aspergillus spp. accounting for the majority of invasive mold infections. 143, 145 Pn. jirovecii pneumonitis occurred in 4-10% of kidney, 10-11% of liver, 5-41% of heart, and 16-43% of heartlung and lung transplant recipients before routine prophylaxis was implemented. 146 It is closely linked with CMV disease.\n\nCandidal infections are associated with death in more than 50% and invasive aspergillosis is almost universally fatal in this group. 143 The site of infection is transplant dependent. Thus urinary tract candidosis is mostly confined to the renal transplant group and lung transplant recipients have a much increased risk of pulmonary infections. Although occurring very infrequently, focal brain infection in solid organ transplant patients is almost exclusively due to fungi, usually Aspergillus spp.; [147] [148] [149] Cryptococcus neoformans is the most frequent cause of meningitis.\n\nMost fungal infections occur in the first 2 months after transplant, 143 although Pn. jirovecii infection tends to be delayed and cryptococcosis usually affects patients in the late transplant period. Infections due to the endemic fungi, including Coccidioides immitis (most often following exposure in the southwestern United States), Histoplasma capsulatum (most often following exposure in the Ohio River Valley, but also elsewhere in the world) and Blastomyces dermatitidis, may also be seen in the late post-transplant period. In one series, the median time to symptoms from histoplasmosis was 11 months after transplantation. 150 The management of these infections is discussed further in Chapter 60.\n\nSince the earliest days of transplantation, virus infections have caused problems in transplant recipients. Members of the Herpesviridae are the most commonly implicated. Cytomegalovirus is responsible for the greatest number of all types of infection in these patients. The incidence varies from 45% to 100%, 151 reflecting the incidence of seropositivity among the recipient population and the numbers of seropositive to seronegative transplantations. However, the incidence of disease is transplant dependent, being lowest in renal transplant recipients, in whom it is symptomatic in less than 10%. 152 Overall, 25-30% of infected patients develop disease, [151] [152] [153] although of those at highest risk (seropositive to seronegative transplants) 50-60% will develop clinical disease. 141 The site of disease is transplant dependent, being focused on the graft. About 3% of all transplant recipients affected will develop CMV pneumonitis. 153 Post-transplant hepatitis occurs in more than 10% of solid organ transplant recipients overall. The most common cause is hepatitis C virus (HCV). In liver transplant patients most of these infections occur as a result of reinfection in patients who have been transplanted for HCV-related cirrhosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques have shown that virtually all infected patients suffer reinfection post-transplant. Before universal screening of blood donors and awareness of donor status, primary HCV infections occurred in more than 35%; 154 the incidence is now much lower. In one study, 95% of patients with pretransplant infection developed post-transplant hepatitis, mostly due to HCV.\n\nReinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) following liver transplantation is almost inevitable unless long-term prophylaxis is used. The highest recurrence is seen in those who are HBV-DNA positive before transplant. 155 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection following transplant is probably underdiagnosed. Most clinical disease is due to reactivation, although primary infection does occur, usually after the patient is discharged, and is responsible for more severe disease. The most important complication of EBV infection is post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). The overall incidence of this condition is approximately 1%. 156 In a large series of various solid organ graft recipients, viremia was found in 3.9%, and 75% of those with primary viremia developed PTLD compared with 11% of secondary viremia cases. 156 The risk of this disease is also increased by the use of antirejection therapy such as OKT3 anti-T-cell antibodies.\n\nBefore the advent of aciclovir, HSV infections (almost exclusively the consequence of reactivation) were responsible for clinical disease in approximately 50% of seropositive patients. 141 HSV infections are now much less clinically significant than other herpes group infections.\n\nHuman herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) may be responsible for central nervous system disease post transplantation. CNS symptoms occurred in 25% of liver transplant recipients with HHV-6 viremia compared with 12% of those without. 157 Infection with HHV-6 may also have an immunomodulatory role, being associated with an increased risk of CMV infection and fungal infection. 158 Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) is transmitted from donor to recipient, resulting in Kaposi's sarcoma in up to 8% of cases who seroconvert. 159 Polyomavirus causes latent infection in the kidney in the immunocompetent subject, and in renal transplant recipients may be responsible for tubulointerstitial nephritis and graft dysfunction. 160 \n\nThe incidence of toxoplasmosis varies according to the type of transplant and is most common in heart transplant recipients, of whom more than 50% of seronegative patients receiving a heart from a seropositive donor will seroconvert. 161 In addition, toxoplasmosis is governed by the seroprevalence of the infection (20% in the UK and higher in other countries such as France) and the serological status of donor and recipient: the highest rate and most severe infections occur when transplanting a seropositive donor to a seronegative recipient. In renal transplant recipients less than 1% develop primary toxoplasmosis. Most such cases occur within 2 months of transplant and are characterized by encephalitis, brain abscess, retinitis, pneumonitis, cardiac involvement and hepatitis. [162] [163] [164] CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS Antimicrobial prophylaxis, along with vaccination and preemptive therapy, form the mainstay of preventive strategies against infection. Until recently, most prophylactic regimens used in transplant recipients have been based on the risk of infection and likely organisms. Regimens shown to be effective in the neutropenic patient or in surgical prophylaxis have been adopted, yet few have been subject to randomized comparative trials. A short course of prophylactic antibiotics is probably appropriate to prevent wound infection related to the procedure itself. Selective decontamination of the digestive tract may be of benefit in some transplant groups, although there is conflicting evidence. Gram-negative infections are reduced in liver transplant recipients 165 but an increase in Gram-positive infections, including MRSA and VRE, has been seen in several heart transplant centers. 166 A number of studies have demonstrated the benefit of longterm prophylaxis for urinary tract infections in renal transplant recipients. Both trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (960 mg nightly) and ciprofloxacin have been effective, although the former has the additional benefit of preventing Pn. jirovecii infection. 167, 168 The issue of mycobacterial prophylaxis remains controversial and policies vary internationally. As there is a significant risk of isoniazid hepatic toxicity, this drug should be used selectively. However, this risk varies according to the transplant, from 2.5% in renal transplant recipients to 41% in liver transplant recipients. 140 Patients in whom such prophylaxis is justified are those of Asian or other high-risk ethnic origin, those with a history of tuberculosis and those with radiographic changes suggesting past chest infection.\n\nThe high risk of fungal infection in liver transplant recipients has led to the administration of antifungal agents in the posttransplant period. Non-absorbable agents such as amphotericin or nystatin, sometimes in combination with oral antibiotics such as gentamicin and polymyxin B, have been widely used. Fluconazole and itraconazole have been studied in randomized comparative trials in liver transplantation and both are better than placebo in preventing superficial and invasive candidosis. 169, 170 Prophylaxis against Pn. jirovecii pneumonia with trimetho primsulfamethoxazole is probably only necessary during the first year post-transplant, except in lung transplant recipients when there is a significant persisting risk of the disease. 171 The current American Society of Transplantation guidelines recommend antiviral prophylaxis in all CMV donor-positive, recipient-negative solid organ transplant recipients. 172 Several randomized comparative studies have demonstrated that early (first 14 days or until discharge) post-transplant ganciclovir, with 173 or without 174 gammaglobulin, is more effective than aciclovir (various doses) in preventing CMV symptomatic infection in liver transplants. Symptomatic infection was reduced to 5-9%.\n\nPre-emptive prophylaxis targets patients at highest risk of disease and limits duration of drug administration, reducing toxicity and cost. Hence, kidney-pancreas transplant patients receiving OKT3 pan-T-cell monoclonal antibody therapy and CMV-shedding liver transplant recipients both appear to benefit from pre-emptive prophylaxis with ganciclovir or foscarnet. 175, 176 CMV antigenemia or PCR-guided pre-emptive therapy based on attainment of a pre-defined viral load is as effective as, but less expensive than, universal oral ganciclovir prophylaxis for 90 days or intravenous ganciclovir for 14 days. 177 The duration of this pre-emptive therapy is not fixed and is determined by viral load and varies in length between centers.\n\nTrials of prophylaxis with lamivudine to prevent recurrence of HBV following liver transplantation have shown that, although HBV-DNA levels become undetectable in virtually all patients, this effect is not sustained because of the emergence of resistant mutants. 178 As a consequence, alternative strategies involving a combination of adefovir, lamivudine and hepatitis B immune globulin are being employed.\n\nAlthough transplant recipients are severely immunocompromised, they do not have the same paucity of signs as neutropenic patients in the face of serious sepsis and, in the immediate postoperative period, behave more like nontransplant patients with surgical sepsis. 179 Consequently, the concept of early empirical therapy in response to fever alone has not been applied to these patients.\n\nAll attempts should be made to identify a focus of sepsis or the non-infective cause for fever in a transplant patient. Antimicrobial therapy may reasonably be withheld if the patient is otherwise well and there is no identifiable infective cause, but this should be kept under review. If empirical treatment is considered necessary, the choice of antimicrobials should be governed by the timing of the infection (and hence the probable organisms), the type of transplant, the site of sepsis, knowledge of colonization with resistant organisms (such as MRSA and VRE), and local antimicrobial resistance patterns, as discussed previously.\n\nFungal infections should be managed using the same agents as used in the neutropenic patient. No antifungal is contraindicated but care is required in their use because of toxicity (especially in renal and liver transplant recipients) and drug interaction (especially flucytosine with antimetabolites and triazoles with ciclosporin and tacrolimus -see below).\n\nIt is probably appropriate to reduce immunosuppression in the face of a progressive life-threatening fungal infection such as invasive aspergillosis, especially in the setting of a nonessential organ graft such as a kidney transplant, although the evidence for benefit is anecdotal. Other attempts at immunomodulation have included the use of colony-stimulating factors. G-CSF antagonizes the effect of triazoles in an immunocompromised mouse model of invasive aspergillosis. 180 GM-CSF has been used with some success in the neutropenic patient and might prove of more use than G-CSF in the transplant setting.\n\nPatients presenting with pulmonary infiltrates and fever 1 month or more post-transplant are most likely to have CMV or Pn. jirovecii infection (unless they are receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis). These infections should be managed as in the HSCT recipient. The possibility of other community-acquired respiratory tract infections, including those due to influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses, should always be borne in mind.\n\nThe incidence of this occurring in renal transplant recipients is 1-2%, 181, 182 is related to the degree of immunosuppression (it is seen particularly in patients receiving OKT3) and is more likely in primary EBV infection. 183 At present, the mainstay of therapy is the reduction of immunosuppression together with intravenous aciclovir (10 mg/kg every 8 h). However, many patients will require local resection or radiotherapy of affected tissue and/or antilymphoma chemotherapy. Developments in this field include the possibility of immunotherapy by means of donor leukocyte infusions. 184 Most recently the efficacy of rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody in the treatment of EBV-driven PTLD, has been described. 185 \n\nCiclosporin and tacrolimus are metabolized by the cytochrome P 450 enzyme system and therefore interact with a number of important antimicrobial agents likely to be prescribed in transplant recipients (Table 40 .4). Levels of these drugs may be altered by the induction or inhibition of this system and it is essential that these are measured to prevent toxicity, as well as to avoid inadequate or excessive immunosuppression with the consequences of rejection or infection. Rifampicin is a potent inducer of these cytochrome isoenzymes and causes increased metabolism of ciclosporin and tacrolimus, as well as reducing the bioavailability of corticosteroids. Erythromycin, some of the newer macrolides (particularly clarithromycin), and the azole antifungal agents, especially ketoconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole (and fluconazole at high doses), competitively inhibit this pathway, thus increasing levels of ciclosporin and tacrolimus.\n\nRenal function is often impaired in the transplantation setting and there may be a complex interaction between ciclosporin (itself potentially nephrotoxic, particularly during initial therapy) and nephrotoxic antimicrobial agents such as the aminoglycosides, high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin and amphotericin. Therapeutic drug monitoring is mandatory (with the exception of amphotericin) to prevent additional toxicity and alternative agents should be chosen whenever possible (Table 40 .4).\n\nPrevention should always be the goal in the management of infective complications in neutropenia and organ transplantation. This has become increasingly important over the past decade with the advent of MRSA, VRE and other resistant organisms. Despite the development of antimicrobials with good activity against the infecting agents, the mortality from many of these infections remains high. The spectrum of immunocompromised patients is changing with the evolution of chemotherapy, stem-cell transplantation, immunosuppression regimens, and tissue and organ transplantation techniques -thus we can expect to see the pattern of opportunistic infections shift as well.
