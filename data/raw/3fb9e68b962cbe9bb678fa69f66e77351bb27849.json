{"title": "Original Article", "body": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is well recognized as a musculoskeletal complication after renal transplantation (RT). With advances in immunosuppressive therapy, improved posttransplant renal function and reduced corticosteroid dose are reported to have led to a decrease in the incidence of ONFH [1e4].\n\nHowever, according to recent screening studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this incidence ranged from 3.8% to 25.5% [3,5e11] , inferring that ONFH remains a significant complication among renal allograft recipients.\n\nImmunosuppressive therapy for renal allograft recipients has changed substantially since the introduction of the anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody, basiliximab (Simulect; Novartis, East Hanover, NJ). When administered as induction therapy during the early postoperative period, improvements in postoperative renal function have been reported [12e15] . Decreases in the doses of steroids and calcineurin inhibitors have also been reported [15] and indications for RT have therefore been expanded to include higherrisk patients with older age and increased human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch. However, the impact of basiliximab administration on the incidence of post-transplant ONFH has not yet been determined, and few MRI screening studies have been conducted since its introduction [3] .\n\nWe hypothesized that recent improvements in immunosuppressive treatment may reduce the incidence of ONFH even with wider indications for RT. The purpose of the present study was twofold: 1) to investigate transitional changes in the incidence of OFNH among renal transplant recipients by MRI; and 2) to investigate factors related to ONFH for the entire cohort.\n\nThe ethical review board of our institution approved the design of this study (registration number: 13271). The Recent group included 110 patients (61 men, 49 women; mean (\u00b1standard deviation) age, 43 \u00b1 13 years, range, 16e70 years); mean body mass index (BMI), (21.9 \u00b1 3.3 kg/m 2 ) who underwent MRI of both hips after RT between April 2003 and June 2012 (i.e., during the period in which basiliximab was regularly used). During the period, 155 patients underwent RT. The Past group included 232 patients (143 men, 89 women; mean age, 34 \u00b1 13 years; mean BMI, 21.9 \u00b1 3.4 kg/ m 2 ) who had undergone RT between January 1986 and March 2003 (i.e., prior to the regular use of basiliximab). During the period, 332 patients underwent RT. There was no significant difference in the rates of MRI screening between the groups. (69.8% (232/332) vs 70.9% (110/155), p \u00bc 0.80, chi-square test). All patients were notified about the reported incidences of ONFH after RT, benefits and risks of MRI, and possible treatment options, and given the opportunity to object. MRI was performed 3 months after RT using either a 1.0-T superconducting magnet system (SIGNA Horizon LX 1.0T; General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI), or one of two 1.5-T superconducting magnet systems (SMT150X; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan or Achieva 1.5T A-series; Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, the Netherlands). Osteonecrosis was defined as an area of normal intensity demarcated by a low-intensity band on T1-weighted imaging [16] . T1-weighted spin-echo images were obtained using a 1.5-T system in the coronal and sagittal planes, with the following settings: repetition time (TR), 500e800 ms; echo time (TE), 12e43 ms; and slice thickness, 2e10 mm. Spoiled gradient-recalled echo pulse sequences were obtained using the 1.0-T system in the coronal plane with the following settings: TR, 4.5e14 ms; TE, 1.84e3.08 ms; flip angle, 30 ; and slice thickness, 1.0e1.5 mm with no interslice gap.\n\nThe following items were evaluated: ONFH incidence; patient demographic and background factors, including gender, age, BMI, and ABO and HLA incompatibility; duration of preoperative dialysis; type of renal graft (living/cadaveric donor); preoperative immunosuppressant use, including calcium inhibitors (cyclosporine A/tacrolimus) administered initially or at the time of hospital discharge; concomitant basiliximab administration; steroid administration at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after RT, as prednisolone (PSL), methylprednisolone (MPSL), and total steroid doses (converted to PSL-equivalent doses); postoperative renal function, including delayed graft function (DGF), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels at 8 weeks after RT, and acute transplant rejection; and duration of hospitalization. PSL-equivalent doses were calculated by adjusting the MPSL dose on the basis of antiinflammatory potency, using a conversion factor of 1.25. Acute transplant rejection was diagnosed as follows: a 40% increase in BUN or a 20% increase in Cr level compared with those at a previous sampling, daily urinary output 750 ml, and diagnosis by biopsy. DGF was defined as a patient requiring hemodialysis in the first week after RT.\n\nWe compared these items between the Recent and Past groups using the ManneWhitney U-test, chi-square test, and Fisher's exact probability test for statistical analyses. In addition, we investigated factors influencing the incidence of ONFH for the entire cohort. Uniand multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify significant risk factors for ONFH for the entire cohort. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for predicting ONFH was determined for each factor identified by univariate logistic regression analysis. SPSS for Windows version 20.0J statistical software (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used for all statistical analyses. A 5% significance level was applied to all tests.\n\nNo cases of ONFH were recorded in the Recent group (0%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0%e3.3%), although eight cases of ONFH were recorded in the Past group (3.4%; 95% CI, 1.5e6.7%; one-sided Fisher's exact probability test, p \u00bc 0.043). Intergroup comparisons of background and demographic factors revealed significant increases in age, BMI, number of patients with ABO and HLA incompatibilities, and living kidney donors in the Recent group ( Table 1) . Comparison of postoperative immunosuppressant use showed increased frequency of tacrolimus use, increased number of patients with concomitant use of basiliximab, and decreases in MPSL, PSL, and total steroid dose at postoperative weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 in the Recent group ( Table 1) . Regardless of the increase in risk factors for RT such as older age and increased number of ABO/HLAincompatible transplants among patients, decreases in steroid administration and improvements in postoperative renal function have been observed in the Recent group. In addition, significant decreases were seen in the number of cases with DGF, concentrations of BUN and Cr at 8 weeks after transplantation, incidence of acute transplant rejection, and duration of hospitalization over time ( Table 1) .\n\nThe overall results were surveyed for risk factors for ONFH. According to the analysis of individual factors, total MPSL dose at postoperative weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8, total steroid dose at postoperative weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 and DGF were identified as significant risk factors (Table 2) . PSL administration at postoperative weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 was not a risk factor. We performed multivariate analysis (logistic regression analysis) for age, gender, and total MPSL dose at postoperative week 2, and DGF. Significant risk factors for ONFH were total MPSL dose at postoperative week 2 (OR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.04e8.07; p \u00bc 0.04) and DGF (OR, 5.97; 95% CI, 1.36e26.26; p \u00bc 0.02) ( Table 3) . When the MPSL doses at postoperative weeks 4, 6, and 8 were selected as a risk factor rather than that at week 2, the following were the adjusted values: for week 4, OR was 2.29 (95% CI, 1.03e5.13; p \u00bc 0.04); for week 6, OR was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.02e3.28; p \u00bc 0.04); and for week 8, OR was 1.71 (95% CI, 1.03e2.83; p \u00bc 0.04). MPSL administration at week 2 showed the highest adjusted OR.\n\nThe types of ONFH according to Japanese investigation committee classification, their natural course and surgical treatment were summarized in Table 4 .\n\nImprovements in post-transplant renal function and reductions in corticosteroid dose may have led to a decrease in the incidence of ONFH [1e4]. Renal graft function after RT has been improving with advances in immunosuppressive agents such as cyclosporine A [2, 17] and tacrolimus [12e14] . Several other immunosuppressive agents including sirolimus, everolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and basiliximab have been introduced in combination with cyclosporine A or tacrolimus and have also improved postoperative renal function [18] . In contrast, few reports have been published about the influence of these new immunosuppressive agents on the incidence of ONFH after RT. Basiliximab, an anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody, is a very strong immunosuppressive agent that exerts its effects through competitive interleukin-2 antagonism [19] . When administered as an induction therapy during the early postoperative period, in conjunction with one or more conventional immunosuppressive drugs, decreases in the incidences of acute transplant rejection and DGF and improvements in survival of the transplanted kidney have been reported [12e15] . Decreases in steroid and calcineurin inhibitor doses have also been reported [15, 20, 21] . These marked changes in immunosuppressive treatments and postoperative renal function may have reduced the incidence of ONFH. The proportion of ONFH patients receiving steroid treatment for renal transplantation has reportedly decreased recently according to the multicenter hospital-based sentinel monitoring system for ONFH in Japan [22] , although the reasons for these decreases in the proportion of ONFH patients receiving renal transplantation remain unclear. In addition, only a small number of reports since 2001 have described MRI screening for ONFH after RT, and the impact of the introduction of basiliximab on the post-transplant incidence of ONFH has yet to be determined. We therefore investigated the incidence of ONFH since the advent of regular basiliximab use and found that postoperative renal graft function had improved, and the MPSL dose and incidence of DGF as risk factors for ONFH had decreased. In addition, the incidence of ONFH had decreased. Basiliximab seems likely to indirectly reduce the incidence of ONFH by reducing the incidence of DGF and allowing reductions in MPSL administration.\n\nThree main limitations need to be considered when interpreting the results from the present study. First, the number of renal transplant recipients with use of basiliximab might be too small to evaluate its effect on the incidence of ONFH. The number of patients included in previous MRI screening studies ranged from 26 to 150 [3,5e10] , so the number of patients in the present study is comparable with the numbers in those studies. Second, MRI screening was not performed before RT, so we could not be sure that ONFH had not been present prior to transplantation. Nevertheless, because the incidence of ONFH in our study was lower than that in any previous study evaluated using MRI, the incidence was presumed to have also been low even before transplantation. Third, the timing of MRI screening was earlier compared to other MRI screening studies. This might be one reason the incidence of ONFH at our institute was lower than described in other reports performed during a similar period. We did not encounter any symptomatic cases with ONFH in which MRI had been negative at 3 months after RT, so we considered that the incidence of ONFH occurring after 3 months after RT was unlikely to have been particularly high.\n\nONFH did not occur in any of the 110 patients who underwent RT between April 2003 and June 2012 at our institution, despite the wider indications for RT in high-risk patients, such as older age and more severe ABO and HLA incompatibilities. In previous MRI screening studies of ONFH after RT performed between 1986 and 2001 without the use of basiliximab, incidences of ONFH after RT were within the range of 3.4e25.4% [3,5e10] . Although a downward trend was observed in those studies, no MRI screening studies for ONFH have been reported since 2002, and the present study showed the lowest incidence of ONFH after RT among all relevant studies (Table 5) .\n\nTo elucidate the risk factors for ONFH, all RT recipients who underwent MRI screening at our institute were analyzed. The results showed that DGF and cumulative MPSL administration up to 2 weeks after RT were significant risk factors. Other risk factors for ONFH reported after RT include daily oral steroid dose, BUN level 2 months after RT, accumulated steroid dose at 2 months, accumulated steroid dose at 2 weeks, ethnicity (African-American), history of peritoneal dialysis, rejection, delayed graft function, and cyclosporine A administration [1,10,11,23e25] . To date, cumulative steroid dose as of 2 weeks postoperatively has been reported as the shortest-term risk factor for ONFH [24] . The risk factors for ONFH after RT in the present study were in accordance with past findings. This result suggests that ONFH occurs mostly within the first 2 weeks after RT, suggesting the importance of controlling postoperative graft function and reducing cumulative MPSL administration in the first 2 weeks after RT using immunosuppressive agents that are appropriate for the prevention of ONFH.\n\nA recent meta-analysis of ONFH occurrences among patients taking corticosteroids reported positive associations between mean daily corticosteroid doses and ONFH across all diagnoses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, bone marrow transplantation and renal transplantation, although the correlation between mean daily corticosteroid dose and ONFH incidence was not significant among renal transplant recipients [26] . No evidence of a significant correlation between cumulative corticosteroid dose and incidence of ONFH has yet been provided [26, 27] . In renal transplant recipients, daily steroid dose is gradually tapered according to the immunosuppressive regimen, so reflecting an overall picture of steroid treatment using a mean value for daily steroid dose is difficult. In addition, duration of steroid treatment and overall cumulative steroid dose vary widely among renal recipients, and steroid administration after onset of ONFH might be included in the regression analysis. We therefore focused on the correlation between steroid administration including oral steroid administration and pulsed steroid therapy in the 8 weeks after renal transplantation and onset of ONFH at 3 months.\n\nThe risk of ONFH after RT has fallen since the advent of regular basiliximab use, although this agent does not appear to be a factor directly associated with the incidence of ONFH. Factors related to ONFH incidence were found to be renal graft function and MPSL administration for up to 2 weeks. Since the introduction of basiliximab, immunosuppressive therapy has changed markedly and renal graft control has also been enhanced, which may have led to decreases in the incidence of ONFH.\n\nThis research is supported by the Practical Research Project for Rare/Intractable Diseases from Japan Agency for Medical Research and development, AMED.\n\nIn accordance with ICMJE criteria, NS and ST designed the study and MT wrote the initial draft of the manuscript.
