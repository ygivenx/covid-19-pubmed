I , 101 An Israel-based study reported that 94 per cent of the patients with rotaviral gastroenteritis were less than 36 months of age and 35 per cent were less than six months of age. 101 In a retrospective study, Foster et al. described an epidemic of 3439 cases of rotaviral gastroenteritis in a remote Pacific island population. 74 The majority of the clinical illnesses were in the age group less than 20 years of age. The age-specific attack rates were 40 per cent in children less than one year of age, 62 per cent in the group aged one to four years, and 12 per cent in adults 20 years of age and older. Black et al. conducted a prospective study in rural Bangladesh, where the peak prevalence of rotaviral gastroenteritis was in the 6 to 11 month age group. 17 Panicker et aI., from a study at a pediatric diarrhea ward in Calicut, India, reported that from 3355 cases of acute diarrhea, rotavirus accounted for 75 per cent of the cases in children 6 to 23 months of age, 65 per cent of the cases in those 24 to 60 months of age, and 35 per cent of the cases in those less than 6 months of age.\n\nThe problem of rotaviruses in neonates is somewhat cloudy. Rotavirus was found by electron microscopy in the feces of 32 per cent of the 1056 five-day-old infants in a study of newborns in English nurseries;9,41 however, the infection was usually asymptomatic.

A similar outbreak in a London geriatric ward has been reported. 47 In all of these instances involving geriatric patients, members of the staff also were reported ill with gastroenteritis. An outbreak in a cardiology ward also affecting the health care staff has been reported. 98 Rotavirus has also been implicated in travelers' diarrhea in adult students in Mexic0 27 and in soldiers in Korea. 60 Several studies document rotaviral infection in adult contacts of pediatric patients with gastroenteritis, with the infection in adults usually mild and frequently asymptomatic.

The vomiting preceded the diarrhea by 2 to 36 hr in 47 per cent of the patients and appeared simultaneously with the diarrhea in 43 per cent. Vomiting was not a symptom in 10 per cent of the cases, although all had diarrhea. In addition to diarrhea and vomiting, fever was present in 63 per cent of the patients. Fifty-three per cent of the patients were dehydrated, usually less than 5 per cent dehydration. The recovery period was usually 5 to 7 days, the longest being 26 days. Bloody stools were not a clinical feature of the illness, and in most studies bloody stools are not observed; however, at least one report described bloody stools as a possible clinical feature of rotaviral diarrhea.. 54 The clinical features of a large epidemic of rotaviral gastroenteritis involving 3439 cases were described by Foster et al. 74 Systemic symptoms were usually absent except in young children. Symptomatic patients passed numerous (3 to 12 per day) watery brown stools (others have described offensive yellow green stools).l83 No blood or excess mucous was observed in stools. Other symptoms included fever, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. Upper respiratory symptoms (nonproductive cough) were present in 10 per cent of the patients. In younger children dehydration was common. Dehydration was a complicating factor in all seven children who died. The illness usually lasted one to four days, and all deaths occurred within the first four days of illness. Chiba et al. described an outbreak of diarrhea in an infant home in Sapporo, Japan, wherein 42 of the 47 infants (90 per cent) were infected, and 90 per cent of those infected showed clinical symptoms. 37 Twentyseven (64 per cent) had diarrhea, 14 per cent suffered from vomiting without diarrhea, and 12 per cent had fever (2:: 38\u00b0rectal) without intestinal symptoms.

Carlson et al. described the clinical and pathologic features of 21 fatal cases of rotaviral gastroenteritis. All patients were between 4 and 30 months of age and resided in the Toronto area. Dehydration (10 to 20 per cent dehydration) and associated electrolyte imbalance were the major factors causing death; however, aspiration of vomit was believed to be the major factor in 3 of the 21 deaths. The authors' report on the autopsy and biochemical findings indicated marked dehydration as the most significant feature. Clinically, vomiting was the most characteristic symptom, occurring in all 21 patients, and was the initial symptom in 14 patients.

These large numbers of viral particles allow detection by several physical or immunologic techniques. The association of rotavirus with human gastroenteritis was first demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy, 15 which remains one of the better diagnostic methods. The detection limit for rotavirus in feces is about 10 7 viral particles per ml. 123 The very distinctive morphology of rotavirus adds to the reliability of electron microscopy for this particular virus. Immune electron microscopy (IEM), similar to the conventional transmission electron microscopy except that specific antiviral serum is mixed with the sample,2, HO can add about 10-fold to the sensitivity of the test and greatly aids in distinguishing between artifacts and specific viral particles. Cell culture techniques in general have not proven satisfactory for detection of rotavirus. However, rotavirus may be detected by immunofluorescence if the sample is treated with trypsin and applied to the cell culture with the use of low-speed centrifugation. 12, 24, 204 Recently the combination of trypsin treatment of samples and the use of roller tube cultures of monkey kidney cells has proven satisfactory for isolating rotavirus from diarrheic fecal specimens. l77 , 197,206 ELISA is currently the method of choice for rotaviral detection in many laboratories. This procedure offers unprecedented sensitivity, specificity, and practicality for an immunodiagnostic technique. 36, 114, 191, 219, 220 ELISA is more sensitive than electron microscopy, but electron microscopy offers the advantage of detecting viruses other than rotaviruses. 182 Commercially prepared conjugates 222 and complete assay kits are available for detection of rotavirus by the ELISA procedure. A very promising development is the multiple determinant ELISA,222 which, through the elimination of several washing and incubation steps, may be completed in 40 min as opposed to 4 hr for a conventional ELISA. The key to this assay is the use of solid phase antibody and enzyme-Iabeled antibody directed at different antigenic sites on the virus.\n\nOther detection procedures for rotavirus include immunoelectroosmophoresis,79 complement fixation, 108, 225 viral RNA electrophoresis, 7, 9:3 radioimmunoassay, 49, 154 and the very rapid latex agglutination technique. lib\n\nMost individuals acquire serum antibody to rotavirus by the age of 2 years,224 and rotaviral infections associated with illness become much less common after 5 years of age. Sequential rotaviral infections commonly occur in children under 5 years of age, but these illnesses are usually the result of infections with different serotypes of rotaviruses. 73, Ill, 173,224 Since most serologic techniques such as immunofluorescence and ELISA do not distinguish between serotypes of rotaviruses, caution must be exercised in interpreting the role of rotavirus-specific antibody in protecting against rotaviral infection. The majority of rotavirus strains from different species share common antigenic determinants (termed group antigens), which are 1038 BILL BAHNETT nonhospitalized children in a prospective study.sH A summary of these two studies is presented in Table 2 .\n\nRotaviral particles may be present in the feces of the infected subject at levels of 10 9 or more per gm of feces.

The detection limit for rotavirus in feces is about 10 7 viral particles per ml. 123 The very distinctive morphology of rotavirus adds to the reliability of electron microscopy for this particular virus. Immune electron microscopy (IEM), similar to the conventional transmission electron microscopy except that specific antiviral serum is mixed with the sample,2, 110 can add about lO-fold to the sensitivity of the test and greatly aids in distinguishing between artifacts and specific viral particles. Cell culture techniques in general have not proven satisfactory for detection of rotavirus. However, rotavirus may be detected by immunofluorescence if the sample is treated with trypsin and applied to the cell culture with the use of low-speed centrifugation. 12, 24, 204 Recently the combination of trypsin treatment of samples and the use of roller tube cultures of monkey kidney cells has proven satisfactory for isolating rotavirus from diarrheic fecal specimens. m, 197,206 ELISA is currently the method of choice for rotaviral detection in many laboratories. This procedure offers unprecedented sensitivity, specificity, and practicality for an immunodiagnostic technique. 36, Jl4, 191,219,220 ELISA is more sensitive than electron microscopy, but electron microscopy offers the advantage of detecting viruses other than rotaviruses. 182 Commercially prepared conjugates 222 and complete assay kits are available for detection of rotavirus by the ELISA procedure. A very promising development is the multiple determinant ELISA,222 which, through the elimination of several washing and incubation steps, may be completed in 40 min as opposed to 4 hr for a conventional ELISA. The key to this assay is the use of solid phase antibody and enzyme-Iabeled antibody directed at different antigenic sites on the virus.\n\nOther detection procedures for rotavirus include immunoelectroosmophoresis,79 complement fixation, 108, 22.5 viral RNA electrophoresis, 7, 98 radioimmunoassay,49, 134 and the very rapid latex agglutination technique. 17li\n\nMost individuals acquire serum antibody to rotavirus by the age of 2 years,224 and rotaviral infections associated with illness become much less common after 5 years of age. Sequential rotaviral infections commonly occur in children under 5 years of age, but these illnesses are usually the result of infections with different serotypes of rotaviruses. 73, 111, 173, 224 Since most serologic techniques such as immunofluorescence and ELISA do not distinguish between serotypes of rotaviruses, caution must be exercised in interpreting the role of rotavirus-specific antibody in protecting against rotaviral infection. The majority of rotavirus strains from different species share common antigenic determinants (termed group antigens), which are 14, 62, 77, 80, 207 Thus, antisera directed against rotaviruses from other species show relatively poor cross-neutralization of human rotavirus. 62 , 77 There are conflicting reports on the subject of cross-protection. Wyatt et al. observed heterologous cross-protection in calves immunized in utero with bovine rotavirus and subsequently challenged as newborns with a human origin strain of rotavirus. 217 Strains of rotaviruses from hunlans can be divided into at least three serotypes. 84 , 207, 216 The serotype specificity resides in a 38,000 dalton surface glycoprotein. 105, 146 Interestingly, this particular glycoprotein exhibits a high degree of sequence heterogeneity, 64 which may in part account for the high frequency of reinfection.\n\nEven when the problem of multiple serotypes is taken into account, there is still a poor correlation between serum rotavirus-specific antibody levels and protection against rotaviral infection. Studies in adult volunteers have shown that rotavirus-specific, secretory IgA in the intestine is the prime correlate with resistance to rotaviral disease .114 This protection is very serotype specific; thus, IgA antibody to serotype 1 does not protect against infection with serotype 2. Sonya and Holmes used an ELISA procedure to measure rotavirus-specific immunoglobulins of the IgA, IgG, and IgM classes in feces from patients infected with rotavirus. 191 The time course of coproantibody response to rotaviral infection was similar for all three immunoglobulin classes, appearing one to two weeks after the onset of illness, reaching peak titers two to four weeks after infection, then dropping sharply to undetectable levels after about two months. The sharp rise in coproantibody levels Inay play a role in the acute, self-limiting nature of most rotaviral infections, and the transient nature of this local immune response may leave the patient susceptible to a subsequent rotaviral infection.\n\nVery little is known about the role of cell-mediated immunity in rotaviral infections. Virus-specific, cell-mediated immunity did not develop in neonatal mice infected with rotavirus. 184 Passive Immunity\n\nIn animal studies, orally ingested antibody in colostrum, milk, or even serum has proven effective in protecting against rotaviral infection. 25, 31, 151, 188, 189, 212 These studies indicate that the antibody must be present in the gut in order to exert a protective effect. Breast feeding decreases the incidence of gastroenteritis in children and decreases the severity of the illness. 41 , 51, 91,180, 185,203,204 This has generally been attributed to anti-rotavirus secretory IgA, present in over 90 per cent of the colostral and milk samples tested. 223 The level of anti-rotavirus secretory IgA in colostrum is independent of antibody levels in the serum. 99 Additionally, others have reported the presence of non-immunoglobulin rotavirus inhibitory activity in milk and colostrum. 164, 165, 205 Secretory IgA antibody to rotavirus is readily detected in milk 6 months to 2 years post partum. 50 , 51, 223 Although many reports indicate a protective role for breast feeding, some 1040 BILL BARNETT readily detected by complement fixation, immunofluorescence, ELISA, and radioimmunoassay.,ll, 49, 80, 107 Rotavirus strains from different host species have unique virus-specified surface antigens that usually are not dif ferentiated by these procedures but that are readily distinguishable on the basis of serum neutralization assays. 14, 62, 77, 80, 207 Thus, antisera directed against rotaviruses from other species show relatively poor cross-neutralization of human rotavirus. 62 , 77 There are conflicting reports on the subject of cross-protection.

Presently there is no rotavirus vaccine for human use. The prospects and problems associated with developing rotavirus vaccines have recently been reviewed. 36, 114 Much of the available evidence indicates that local immunity in the gut, such as that associated with secretory IgA, is more important than serum antibody in protecting against rotaviral disease. For this reason a high priority has been placed on the development of an oral, live-type vaccine. Attempts are underway to generate cell culture-adapted, attenuated strains of rotavirus to be tested as candidate vaccines. 114 Another approach is to isolate reassortant hybrid rotaviruses from mixed cultures of human and bovine rotaviruses. Although such hybrids have been isolated,84 their pathogenicity and immunogenicity remain to be determined. An attenuated live-type rotavirus vaccine has been used in cattle for many years. 152 A new approach with the bovine vaccine has been to utilize maternal vaccination in order to take advantage of the subsequent transfer of passive immunity to the offspring. 187\n\nThere are two major epidemiologic forms of viral gastroenteritis. Rotaviruses cause sporadic, but occasionally epidemic, gastroenteritis, usually occurring during the winter months. This form primarily affects infants and young children, lasts 5 to 8 days, often leads to dehydration, and may require medical attention. The second form of gastroenteritis is more epidemic in nature, usually results in a shorter and milder illness, and occurs throughout the year in older children and adults. A group of 27-nm viruses referred to as the Norwalk-like viruses are responsible for the majority of the outbreaks of the second form. The prototype virus of this group, the Norwalk virus, was discovered in a 1968 outbreak of gastroenteritis in Norwalk, Ohio. 113 The outbreak affected 50 per cent of the students at an elementary school and 32 per cent of the family contacts. Symptoms lasted 12 to 24 hr with an apparent incubation period of 48 hr. Of the 604 subjects with symptomatic infections, 85 per cent had nausea, 85 per cent vomiting, 52 per cent abdominal cramps, 44 per cent diarrhea, and 32 per cent fever. There were no deaths, and none of the subjects were hospitalized.

As yet we know only enough about these viruses to allow for the most tentative classification. The viral particle is round, 27-nm in diameter, and nonenveloped (see Fig. 1 ). The capsomeric substructure has not been clearly visualized. In most electron micrographs the virioN substructure is quite hazy as a result of antibody coating the particles (a consequence of the IEM procedure). The Norwalk viruses remain infectious after exposure to pH 2.7 for 3 hr, 20 per cent ether for 24 hr, or heating at 60\u00b0C for 30 min. 56 The density of the virion in CsCI is 1.37 to 1.41 gm per ml. 109 These properties led to tentative classification as a parvoviruslike agent. 109 The paroviruses are single-stranded DNA viruses that multiply in the nucleus of the host cell. Included in the family Parvoviridae are the adeno-associated viruses, which replicate only in cells that are also infected with adenovirus, the Aleutian mink disease virus, and several parvoviruses that cause gastroenteritis in agriculturally important animals.

The high percentage of outbreaks caused by the Norwalk virus indicates that there are probably only a few serotypes responsible for acute gastroenteritis in contrast to the more than 70 serotypes of enteroviruses and the more than 100 different serotypes of rhinoviruses. 21 In studies with volunteers inoculated with the Norwalk, Hawaii, and Montgomery County (MC) viruses,215 all of these viruses induced short-term homologous immunity, and exposure to the Norwalk virus produced partial protection against subsequent challenge with the MC virus. The Hawaii virus did not appear to be serologically related to either the Norwalk or the MC viruses. \n\nBecause the Norwalk-like viruses are present only at low concentrations in diarrheic feces and since they have not yet been cultured in vitro, the detailed characterization of this group of viruses has not been performed.

Caliciviruses are known to be associated with gastroenteritis in humans. 70, 148, 192 Caliciviruses have single-stranded RNA genomes; thus although final classification of the Norwalk viruses awaits the characterization of their nucleic acids, it is thought that they may be a type of calicivirus.\n\nNorwalk viral gastroenteritis is usually milder than the illness caused by rotavirus. Many outbreaks of 24-hr influenza, intestinal influenza, and stomach influenza are actually Norwalk viral infections. In describing 38 Norwalk viral outbreaks, Kaplan et al. point out that only 3 persons required hospitalization.u 5 However, an outbreak of Norwalk viral infection in a nursing home may have been a factor in the deaths of two patients. Norwalk viral gastroenteritis may last from 2 hr to several days, but the illness usually lasts 24 to 48 hr. The incubation period is also 24 to 48 hr. The symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, fever, headache, and myalgias. Vomiting occurs more frequently in children, and diarrhea is more common in adults. In 6 elementary school outbreaks, 75 per cent of the ill children vomited and 46 per cent passed diarrheic stools in contrast to 4 outbreaks primarily in adults in which vomiting was a symptom in 51 per cent and diarrhea in 85 per cent. U5 In several studies adult volunteers have been challenged with Norwalk-like viruses. 20, 55, 57, 58, 196, 201 Symptoms in adult volunteers who received an oral dose of a 2 per cent stool filtrate of the original Norwalk virus closely resembled those observed in outbreaks. Thirty-three of the 55 volunteers became ill. Symptoms included anorexia in 95 per cent, headache in 84 per cent, diarrhea in 84 per cent, abdominal discomfort in 72 per cent, vomiting in 63 per cent, and fever (;::: 37.4\u00b0C) in 50 per cent. 209 Bloody stools are not seen in Norwalk viral infections.\n\nResults from small bowel biopsy specin1ens are consistent with the presence or absence of clinical illness.

There are no satisfactory procedures for detecting these viruses in water; thus coliform counts are often used as indirect evidence for possible contamination with Norwalk-like viruses. Taylor et al. described an outbreak initiated by contaminated water at an elementary school. 198 Illness developed in 72 per cent of the students and teachers. The secondary attack rate was 32 per cent in families of those who had become ill after drinking water at the school.

Another problem with RIA is that it does not detect the morphologically similar, but antigenically distinct, Norwalklike viruses.\n\nNorwalk viral infections occur on a worldwide basis. Greenberg et al. found that 50 to 80 per cent of adults in both developed and developing countries have serum antibody to Norwalk virus. 82 The age-related distribution of serum antibody to Norwalk virus is very distinct from that for serum antibody to rotavirus. Blacklow et al. used RIA to test sera from 308 residents of Massachusetts and found Norwalk virus antibody in 20 per cent of the infants 0 to 3 months of age (presumably of maternal origin).22 In infants 6 months of age, Norwalk antibody was not detected, and the per cent of children with detectable anti-Norwalk virus antibody remained at 5 per cent through 8 years of age. A sharp rise in the prevalence of Norwalk virus antibody was observed in the adolescent and early adult years. Approximately 50 per cent of those over 20 years of age posses~ed antibody. In the developing countries antibody to the Norwalk virus is acquired much earlier in life. In a longitudinal study of young children in Bangladesh the prevalence of antibody to Norwalk virus was 7 per cent in infants younger than 6 months and increased to 80 per cent in children 2 to 5 years of age. 18 The antigenic relationships among Snow Mountain, Hawaii, and Norwalk viruses were determined by IEM using serum antibody from previously challenged volunteers. 58 Each of the three viruses showed a strong reaction with homologous antibody, but no heterologous reactions were observed. Sera positive for antibody to the Snow Mountain virus did not react with the Marin County virus 163 in the IEM procedure. 58 Previously it had been shown that the Marin County virus does not cross-react with the Norwalk or Hawaii viruses .163 Thus, the Norwalk, Marin County, Hawaii, and Snow Mountain viruses appear to represent four antigenically distinct serotypes of morphologically indistinguishable Norwalk-like viruses. There are several other viruses in this group that remain to be serotyped. In vivo cross-challenge studies in volunteers showed that the Norwalk virus and Montgomery County virus are serologically related, whereas there was no heterologous cross-protection between the Hawaii virus and the Norwalk virus. 215 The subject of clinical immunity to Norwalk viral infection is very puzzling. In about 50 per cent of the volunteers inoculated with Norwalk virus, gastroenteritis and an antibody response to the infection developed. 201 However, the susceptibility does not appear to hold to the classic picture of antibody-mediated immunity.

Blacklow et al. used RIA to test sera from 308 residents of Massachusetts and found Norwalk virus antibody in 20 per cent of the infants 0 to 3 months of age (presumably of maternal origin). 22 In infants 6 months of age, Norwalk antibody was not detected, and the per cent of children with detectable anti-Norwalk virus antibody remained at 5 per cent through 8 years of age. A sharp rise in the prevalence of Norwalk virus antibody was observed in the adolescent and early adult years. Approximately 50 per cent of those over 20 years of age possessed antibody. In the developing countries antibody to the Norwalk virus is acquired much earlier in life. In a longitudinal study of young children in Bangladesh the prevalence of antibody to Norwalk virus was 7 per cent in infants younger than 6 months and increased to 80 per cent in children 2 to 5 years of age. IS The antigenic relationships among Snow Mountain, Hawaii, and Norwalk viruses were determined by IEM using serum antibody from previously challenged volunteers.58 Each of the three viruses showed a strong reaction with homologous antibody, but no heterologous reactions were observed. Sera positive for antibody to the Snow Mountain virus did not react with the Marin County virus l63 in the IEM procedure. 58 Previously it had been shown that the Marin County virus does not cross-react with the Norwalk or Hawaii viruses. 163 Thus, the Norwalk, Marin County, Hawaii, and Snow Mountain viruses appear to represent four antigenically distinct serotypes of morphologically indistinguishable Norwalk-like viruses. There are several other viruses in this group that remain to be serotyped. In vivo cross-challenge studies in volunteers showed that the Norwalk virus and Montgomery County virus are serologically related, whereas there was no heterologous cross-protection between the Hawaii virus and the Norwalk virus. 215 The subject of clinical immunity to Norwalk viral infection is very puzzling. In about 50 per cent of the volunteers inoculated with Norwalk virus, gastroenteritis and an antibody response to the infection developed. 20l However, the susceptibility does not appear to hold to the classic picture of antibody-mediated immunity. There is a short-term immunity to Norwalk infection-when previously ill volunteers were rechallenged 4 to 14 weeks after the initial illness, they remained well. 20, 23, 168 However, volunteers who previously became ill when inoculated with Norwalk virus again became ill when rechallenged after 27 months, even though they often possessed high serum-or duodenal fluid-antibody titers to Norwalk virus. 52, 168 The volunteers who did not become ill usually had no or a very low antibody titer to Norwalk virus both before and after challenge. On rechallenge 27 to 42 months later, the same volunteers who became ill the first time became ill again, and those in whom gastroenteritis did not develop on initial challenge again remained symptom-free. Factors other than antibody appear to be important in susceptibility to Norwalk viral infection. Antibody may play a role in short-term immunity, but long-term immunity appears to be independent of antibody. 168 In the case of either serum antibody or local jejunal antibody to Norwalk virus, those individuals with antibody are much more likely to be susceptible than those with little or no antibody. Susceptibility may be determined by factors such as the presence or absence of viral receptors, in which case antibody is just an indication of past infection and therefore indicates susceptibility. The paradoxical relationship of antibody to susceptibility and the lack of demonstrated long-term imn1unity do not forecast much hope for the development of a vaccine to prevent Norwalk viral infections.\n\nRotaviruses and Norwalk-like viruses appear to be the major etiologic agents for the two primary epidemiologic forms of acute viral gastroenteritis. However, there are several other candidate viruses.\n\nOther than rotaviruses, adenoviruses are the most frequently observed viruses in stools from children with gastroenteritis. Many groups have observed fastidious adenoviruses on electron micrographs (see Fig. 1 ) in diarrheic fecal specimens. 66 , 76,100,155,208,221 Unlike other adenoviruses that are easy to cultivate and type, these enteric-type (ET) adenoviruses have tesisted propagation in cell culture. It was found recently that the ET adenoviruses possess a distinct set of antigenic determinants that can be detected by ELISA.lOo, 221 Furthermore, these ET adenoviruses produce a characteristic cytopathic effect in a line of human embryonic kidney cells transformed by adenovirus type 5 (293 cells), but not in nontransformed human embryonic kidney cells. 195, 221 Fecal adenoviruses that are readily cultivatable by standard techniques are found with about the same frequency in subjects with or without gastroenteritis.I\u00b02, 221 However, the fastidious ET adenoviruses are highly associated with gastroenteritis in children. 138 , 221 Yolken et al. examined the feces of 99 infants between the ages of 4 and 25 months while they were inpatients at a Baltimore area hospital. 221 Twenty-seven had an episode of diarrhea during the study, and ET adenovirus was identified in the stools of 52 per cent of the children with diarrhea. ET adenovirus was found in only one of 72 (1.4 per cent) children without diarrhea. The ET adenovirus-associated illnesses lasted 1046 BILL BARNETT to 14 weeks after the initial illness, they remained welJ.20, 21, 16R However, volunteers who previously became ill when inoculated with Norwalk virus again became ill when rechallenged after 27 months, even though they often possessed high serum-or duodenal fluid-antibody titers to Norwalk virus,\u00b752, 16~ The volunteers who did not become ill usually had no or a very low antibody titer to Norwalk virus both before and after challenge, On re challenge 27 to 42 months later, the same volunteers who became ill the first time became ill again, and those in whom gastroenteritis did not develop on initial challenge again remained symptom-free, Factors other than antibody appear to be important in susceptibility to Norwalk viral infection.

ET adenovirus was found in only one of 72 (1.4 per cent) children without diarrhea. The ET adenovirus-associated illnesses lasted for a mean of 8.0 days, and the children passed a mean maximum of 8.5 stools per day. Other symptoms were upper respiratory (93 per cent), with. 43 per cent having signs of pneumonia, fever (93 per cent), and vomiting (79 per cent). The epidemiology of ET adenovirus-associated gastroenteritis is not well defined. It remains to be established whether the 52 per cent association with cases of infantile gastroenteritis in the reported study is indicative of the prevalence of ET adenovirus-associated gastroenteritis. 221\n\nAstroviruses Astroviruses are 28 to 30 nm in diameter with a very characteristic 5-or 6-pointed star-shaped surface structure (see Fig. 1 ). 39 Astroviruses have not been cultivated in vitro and their nucleic acid type is unknown; they therefore have not been classified. Several outbreaks of gastroenteritis in children, infants, and adults have been associated with astroviruses. 6 , 125, 130, 136 Studies in volunteers indicate that astroviruses are transmissible but have a low pathogenicity in adults. 129 Clinical symptoms of astroviral infection in a gastroenteritis outbreak in a kindergarten in Japan (attack rate 52.3 per cent) were vomiting (64 per cent), abdominal pain (49 per cent), diarrhea (30 per cent), and fever higher than 37.5\u00b0C (30 per cent). The disease was self-limiting, the symptoms lasted an average of 12 hours, and only one of the 46 ill subjects required medical care. 125 Astroviruses are excreted in large nurnbers and are readily detected by electron microscopy. Identification is silnplified as a result of their very characteristic morphology. IEM, using paired acute and convalescent sera and feces rich in viral particles, is useful for establishing etiology.122, 125 However, the star-like morphology is obscured in IEM when the viruses are coated by specific antibody.6 Astroviral antibody may be detected using indirect fluorescence and infected primary human embryo kidney cultures. 128 Most children (70 per cent) acquire astroviral antibody by 5 years of age. 128\n\nEnteroviruses do not appear to play a major epidemiologic role in gastroenteritis, but enteroviral disease is frequently severe in infants. 39, 131, 157 Meningitis, polio-like paralytic disease, and severe systemic disease are associated with enteroviral infections. 39, 119, 131, 157 These infections are more prevalent in the summer months. The incidence is 10 or more times greater in infants than it is in school-aged children, and nearly 100 times greater than in adults. 157\n\nCoronaviruses have been detected in the feces of persons with gastroenteritis. 45 The very distinctive morphology of coronaviruses makes them easy to identify. They are enveloped, about 100 nm in diameter, and possess characteristic club-shaped projections surrounding the virus like a halo or crown, hence the name (see Fig. 1 ). Coronaviruses are found frequently in feces from asymptomatic adults; thus, their relation to gastroenteritis is uncertain. 45 These RNA-containing viruses are associated with 5 to 10 per cent of the upper and lower respiratory tract infections in man.\n\nfor a mean of 8.0 days, and the children passed a mean maximum of 8 .. 5 stools per day.

Caliciviruses have been associated with several well-defined outbreaks of gastroenteritis primarily in infants and children. 38, 48, 69, 137, 148, 192 The symptoms associated with the reported outbreaks were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, Rising antibody titers were measured by IEM . 148 \n\nMost cases of viral gastroenteritis are self-limiting and only rarely require medical attention. However, in severe cases, especially in the very young or the debilitated, prompt therapy is necessary.\n\nIn an analysis of 21 fatal cases of rotaviral gastroenteritis, the primary characteristic was profound dehydration. These children were 10 to 20 per cent dehydrated at the time of death. 35 Some of these children were examined for signs of dehydration in the morning, but rapidly dehydrated through the day and succumbed by evening. Thus, the primary therapy is to maintain the proper state of hydration. Acute diarrhea may be caused by any of several bacterial, protozoan, or viral agents, yet the physiologic effects are quite similar. These include (1) dehydration, electrolyte deficiency, and acidosis; and (2) anorexia and possibly vomiting, which reduces nutrient intake. 175 Acute viral diarrhea is self-limiting and c~n be effectively treated by rehydration therapy. In the majority of cases, oral rehydration therapy is quite satisfactory and has several advantages over intravenous rehydration therapy. Black has recently examined the subject of rehydration therapy and included a list of criteria for assessing the level of dehydration as well as listing accompanying recommendations for therapy. 16 The World Health Organization (WHO) is promoting the widespread use of oral rehydration therapy as a part of their commitment to primary health care. 214 The oral rehydration solution recommended by the WHO can be prepared by adding the following to one liter of water: sodium chloride, 3.5 gm; sodium bicarbonate, 2.5 gm; potassium chloride, 1.5 gm; and. glucose, 20 gm. 213 This solution has been used extensively for treatment of enterotoxin-mediated diarrhea and rotaviral diarrhea. 199 Black has discussed this formulation and recommendations for its use. 16 The WHO formulation calls for glucose, but some studies have compared glucose to sucrose as the carbohydrate source. The advantage of sucrose is its lower cost and greater availability.
