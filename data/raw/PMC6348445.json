{"title": "Inorganic Complexes and Metal-Based Nanomaterials\nfor Infectious Disease Diagnostics", "body": "The World Health Organization\ndepicts LMIC health care accessibility and infrastructure as a tiered\npyramid structure, in which the best-equipped facilities are the least\naccessible and facilities with the least amount of resources are most\ncommon (Figure 1).8 In this system, a Level 1 facility is a primary\ncare setting with little laboratory infrastructure, trained personnel,\nor advanced diagnostic technology. In LMICs, both urban and rural\nLevel 1 facilities frequently lack essential resources such as consistent\nelectricity and clean running water. District hospitals (Level 2),\nregional laboratories (Level 3), and national reference laboratories\n(Level 4) have more advanced diagnostic technology available with\nincreasing infrastructure; however, these facilities are often inaccessible\nto most patients in need due to geography, cost, and lack of transportation.8\n\nConsider the case of early human\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosis\nin exposed infants. Coulibaly et al. highlight the challenges faced\nby this population in their 2011 Burkina Faso study.9 HIV-positive mothers were advised to attend a 6-week postnatal\nappointment\nat their nearest primary healthcare facility for collection of dried\nblood spot samples from their exposed infants. Qualified sample collection\ntechnicians were often only available once each month, so mothers\nwould have to return to the clinic on that day for testing. Once collected,\nthe dried blood spot samples were sent to district-level hospitals\n(Level 2), which then sent the samples to a reference laboratory (Level\n3). The tertiary laboratory then determined viral load by performing\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect HIV genetic material. Test\nresults followed the same circuitous path back to the patients, a\nprocess that could take as long as four months. Additionally, in the\ncase of a positive dried blood spot result, the process had to be\nrepeated in order to validate the original results.9 In contrast, the same high-risk newborns in the United\nStates are screened for HIV at birth with additional tests at 2\u20133\nweeks, 1\u20132 months, and 4\u20136 months.10 For these patients, results are usually available within\n1 or 2 days of sample collection, allowing immediate antiretroviral\ntreatment for HIV-positive children.11 The\nconsequences of diagnostic efficiency versus inefficiency could not\nbe more striking; in the Burkina Faso study, 10% of the HIV-positive\ninfants died before antiretroviral therapy could even be started,\nwhile the early treatment initiated in the U.S. improved infant survival\nby a remarkable 76%.9,12 The stark disparity in response\ntime between these two settings shows just how devastating outcomes\ncan be for patients relying on Level 1 facilities for their healthcare\nneeds.\n\nDisease diagnosis in a Level 1 setting represents a challenge\nthat\noften requires simple tools that can be used without skilled personnel\nor significant laboratory or physical infrastructure. The World Health\nOrganization has developed a set of criteria (\u201cASSURED\u201d)\nthat defines the ideal characteristics for point-of-care (POC) tests\nin low-resource settings.13 In accordance\nwith these criteria, an ideal test should be affordable to those who\nare at risk of infection, result in few false-negatives (sensitive)\nand false-positives (specific), and be user-friendly, rapid and robust,\nequipment-free, and deliverable to the populations in need of the\ntest. Additionally, the required performance parameters of a test\ndepend on its intended use-case scenario. For individual patient case\nmanagement, sensitive multiplexed tests are advantageous for determining\nthe source(s) of nonspecific symptoms and selection of appropriate\ntreatment. From an epidemiological standpoint, if the goal is simply\nto reduce the prevalence of high-intensity infections within a geographic\nregion, the need to quantify disease burden outweighs the need for\nhigh analytical sensitivity. If the goal is disease elimination, high\nanalytical sensitivity is one of the most important parameters, since\nthe interruption of local transmission requires the detection of every\ninfection, including extremely low-intensity infections.\n\nThe most\nsensible approach to designing and developing a POC diagnostic is\nto examine and optimize each individual component before integrating\ninto a single diagnostic device. In this review, we define the components\nof a diagnostic to include: (1) the target biomarker, an endogenous\nindicator of a disease state, which is most often a pathogen or host\nprotein, carbohydrate, or nucleic acid sequence, (2) sample preparation,\nwhich allows for biomarker isolation, purification, and/or concentration\nfrom complex biological matrices, (3) molecular recognition elements,\nwhich specifically capture and detect the target biomarker, (4) signal\ngeneration and amplification, and (5) instrumentation for signal read-out.\nSimple components requiring only a single user step are generally\npreferable in low-resource Level 1 settings. However, there are few\ndiagnostic technologies that currently can be deployed in these settings,\nand the lack of appropriate diagnostics in resource-limited settings\ncan lead to tragic outcomes. Fortunately, emerging technologies based\non inorganic chemistry and nanomaterials can be exploited as potential\nsolutions. In this review, we focus on how inorganic chemistry and\nnanomaterials have been utilized in each component of a POC diagnostic\nfor infectious disease detection. Section 2 describes inorganic biomarkers that are\nassociated with infectious diseases and how their properties have\nbeen exploited in diagnostic applications. In section 3, we discuss how coordination chemistry has\nbeen harnessed for sample preparation and protein biomarker enrichment\nfor POC tests. Section 4 details the critical advancements in inorganic chemistry and nanomaterials\nfor signal generation probes that have allowed the field of POC diagnostics\nto rapidly progress. In section 5, we provide an overview of field-deployable instrumentation\nthat incorporates the fundamental inorganic chemistries discussed\nin sections 2\u20134 for POC diagnosis of infectious disease. Finally, section 6 discusses the emerging\ntrend of using inorganic chemistry and nanomaterials for nucleic acid\ndetection at the point of care.\n\nHemozoin,\noften called malaria\npigment, is a biomineral produced by some parasites that rely on hematophagy\nas their primary source of nutrients.14 Hemozoin was first described for the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum over a century ago and is produced\nby all Plasmodium species.15\u221217 In the erythrocytic life stages, malaria parasites digest host hemoglobin\nin the acidic digestive food vacuole as a source of amino acids. The\nbreakdown of one hemoglobin molecule releases four molecules of heme\n(ferriprotoporphyrin IX [Fe(III)PPIX]), which are highly toxic to\nthe parasite.17 As Plasmodium spp. lack functional heme oxygenase activity, the parasites remove\nthe free heme by crystallizing it into insoluble, inert hemozoin crystals.17,18 These crystals accumulate in the parasite over the course of its\nerythrocytic life cycle. After the mature schizont ruptures, hemozoin\nis released into circulation and rapidly taken up by phagocytes.19 The heme detoxification pathway that produces\nhemozoin is crucial for malaria parasite survival; therefore, hemozoin\nindicates the presence of Plasmodia parasites, making it an attractive biomarker for malaria detection.19\n\nStructurally, hemozoin crystals consist\nof reciprocating Fe(III)PPIX dimers linked through coordination between\nthe central ferric ions and a carboxylate group of one of the propionate\nmoieties on protoporphyrin IV.17,20,21 Dimers assemble into chains through hydrogen bonding of the second\npropionate porphyrin side chain, and these networks of cross-linked\ndimers are held together via \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions (Figure 2), resulting in an\nanisotropic rectangular crystal with unique magnetic, optical, and\nphotoacoustic properties.22\n\nOne such property of hemozoin is its paramagnetism, which\nis derived\nfrom the unpaired electrons on the central Fe(III) ions.23 Like all paramagnetic substances, hemozoin has\na magnetic moment and is thus attracted up a magnetic gradient in\nthe presence of an externally applied magnetic field. The paramagnetism\nof hemozoin has been leveraged for malaria diagnosis in several ways.\nFirst, the magnetic properties have been exploited for separation,\npurification, and concentration of infected red blood cells (iRBCs)\nfrom blood samples. With the use of a high-gradient external magnetic\nfield, iRBC separation was first performed by Heidelberger et al.24 in 1946 for the purpose of vaccine development,\nthough at the time the method was described as \u201capplicable\nonly to small blood volumes, [and requiring] apparatus difficult of\naccess.\u201d24 Since then, the availability\nof high-field permanent magnets and electromagnets has substantially\nimproved, and the time required for magnetic separation of iRBCs has\nbeen reduced. Both commercially available systems as well as custom-made\nmicrofluidic devices have been used to enrich iRBCs from whole blood\nsamples for analysis by microscopy.25\u221232\n\nThree groups have explored\ndetection of hemozoin based on the fact\nthat paramagnetic materials decrease nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\ntransverse relaxation time (T2) of water,\nthe same phenomenon leveraged for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\ncontrast agents. Karl et al.33 first demonstrated\nthat hemozoin could be detected based on decreased T2, though only at parasitemias greater than 10000 parasites/microliter,\nwhich is 2 orders of magnitude greater than the detection limits of\ncommercial rapid diagnostic tests. Several years later, Peng et al.34 and Kong et al.35 developed a low-cost (<$2000), homemade micromagnetic resonance\ndevice for hemozoin-based malaria detection. They reported detection\nlimits less than 10 parasites/microliter using their method and attributed\nthis drastic improvement to the use of ultrashort echo times and a\npremeasurement centrifugation step that pelleted red blood cells from\nwhole blood.34 These discordant conclusions\nled to a reaction by Karl et al.36 and\na response by Peng et al.37 Recently, Gossuin\net al.38 confirmed the results of Karl\net al., indicating that conventional relaxometry alone is insufficient\nfor sensitive malaria detection. These findings led to two hypotheses\nrelated to the superior sensitivity measured by Peng et al.: (1) the\npremeasurement centrifugation of higher-density iRBCs (compared to\nuninfected RBCs) significantly enriched hemozoin in the portion of\nthe pellet measured, and (2) ultrashort echo times may have allowed\nfor probing of other protons, such as macromolecular protons, which\nmay be more susceptible to the presence of hemozoin.38 A simple, low-resource relaxometry-based detection device\nremains to be developed, and such a device would ultimately require\nresources typically not available in primary healthcare settings in\nLMICs (i.e., consistent availability of electricity and clean water).\nHowever, these studies highlight the importance and advantages of\nsample preparation and enrichment steps in the development of sensitive\ninfectious disease diagnostics.\n\nIn addition to its paramagnetic\nproperties, the unique optical\nproperties of hemozoin enable the development of new diagnostic tools\nfor malaria detection. In particular, hemozoin strongly scatters and\nabsorbs light.39 The latter characteristic\nled to the remarkable development of the Microvascular Microscope\n(MvM) for needle-free, in vivo detection of hemozoin.40,41 The MvM employed cross-polarized epi-illumination to optically access\nvessels below the surface of the skin, with green light (\u03bb =\n532 nm) illumination for locating vessels and red light (\u03bb =\n655 nm) illumination for detecting hemozoin. This method was able\nto detect parasitemias as low as 0.03% in mouse models, corresponding\nto approximately 1000 parasites/microliter in humans. Unfortunately,\nlower parasite density infections were not explored.40 The MvM was able to differentiate between iRBCs and hemozoin-containing\nwhite blood cells, which can persist in circulation for weeks after\nan infection is cleared, based on the diameter and relative intensity\nof the detected hemozoin.41 Additionally,\nhemozoin particle velocity could be measured in vivo (Figure 3), potentially allowing for\nidentification of cytoadhesion and sequestration, two phenomena related\nto disease severity.41,42 Though further sensitivity analysis\nand field testing is required, the MvM represents a promising, noninvasive\ntool for malaria detection, particularly if a portable and battery-powered\ndevice is developed.\n\nPhotoacoustic spectroscopy has\nalso demonstrated potential for\ntransdermal malaria detection.43\u221248 Photoacoustic (PA) hemozoin detection requires excitation with intense\nlight and measurement of the resulting acoustic signals generated\nby local thermal expansion of the surrounding medium. The utility\nof in vitro PA detection of hemozoin was first demonstrated by Balasubramanian\net al. in 1984.43 Since then, it has been\nshown that short, intense laser excitation of hemozoin in the parasite\ncan localize heat around the crystal, evaporating the surrounding\nmedium and creating transient, nanosized vapor bubbles. The expansion\nand collapse of these nanobubbles enhance acoustic detection.44 This technique has allowed for transdermal malaria\ndetection with exceptional sensitivity in mice. This method was also\napplied to one human patient with high parasite density (8900\u201365000\nparasites/microliter).45\u221248 Further studies with increased patient sample size will be necessary\nto determine the true limits of the technology.\n\nMagneto-optical\ndetection exploits both the paramagnetic and optical\nproperties of malarial hemozoin crystals, which have a rectangular\nshape that affords a high level of both magnetic anisotropy and optical\ndichroism. In this technique, whole blood (or lysed whole blood) is\ninserted into a magnetic field, orienting the paramagnetic crystals\nalong the applied field direction. This phenomenon, known as the Cotton-Mouton\neffect, induces an optical dichroism across the dispersion of crystals,\nresulting in a detectable change in transmittance of modulated polarized\nlight (\u03bb = 660 nm) (Figure 4).49,50 When applied to patient whole\nblood samples, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of magneto-optical\ndetection were not competitive with rapid diagnostic tests and PCR,\nthough the ease of use is encouraging for POC applications.49,50 In particular, model simulations have suggested that magneto-optic\ndetection of hemozoin could be exploited for the development of a\nnoninvasive probe capable of measuring transmittance of polarized\nlight through a fingertip.51 A similar\nmagneto-optic strategy that employs a fluctuating magnetic field and\nmeasures the change in amplitude of transmittance has shown potential\nin mouse models, but further evaluation of the diagnostic sensitivity\nand specificity in human samples is needed.52\u221255 Recently, a commercial magneto-optic\ndevice for malaria detection based on hemozoin has demonstrated promise\nin field evaluations, detecting clinical parasite densities as low\nas 5 parasites/microliter (Hemex Health).56\n\nAdditional techniques used to\ndetect malarial hemozoin include\nflow cytometry,57\u221260 laser-desorption mass spectrometry,61\u221264 and Raman spectroscopy.65\u221269 While these strategies are highly sensitive, they require expensive\nand resource-intensive instrumentation that typically prevent their\nuse in a district hospital setting, local health outpost, or field\nsetting. However, as instruments become more compact, robust, and\naffordable, similar to some of the technologies detailed in this section,\ntheir implementation in field settings could become more feasible.\n\nImportantly, hemozoin is synthesized by other hematophagous parasites\nthat infect humans, including the Schistosoma, Echinostoma, and Opisthorchis trematodes, as well as blood feeding\ninsects, such as Rhodnius and Boophilus.17,70,71 Despite being produced by these additional parasites, hemozoin has\nnot yet been used as a diagnostic biomarker for nonmalarial pathogens.\nFurther, it is important to note that in all of the aforementioned\nhemozoin-based malarial detection strategies, hemozoin originating\nfrom trematodes would produce a positive signal. This is particularly\nimportant to consider regarding false positive tests since the geographic\ndistribution of malaria overlaps with Schistosoma.72,73\n\nIn addition to confounding signal\noriginating from other hematophagous\nparasites, hemozoin as a biomarker presents some unique challenges\nto malaria diagnosis. First, the biocrystal is present at much lower\nconcentrations in the ring stage when compared to the later trophozoite\nand schizont stages of the erythrocytic cycle.32 Thus, magnetic enrichment or malaria diagnosis strategies\nbased on hemozoin could miss early stages of infection, potentially\nresulting in false-negatives. Additionally, phagocytic cells ingest\niRBCs and hemozoin released into circulation after schizont rupture,\nand hemozoin-containing white blood cells have been shown to persist\nin circulation up to 17 days after parasite clearance.74 This persistence can lead to false-positive\nresults in hemozoin-based malarial diagnostics unless an algorithm\nfor distinguishing pigment-containing white blood cells and iRBCs\nis devised, such as the one developed in the aforementioned work by\nBurnett et al.41 Despite these challenges,\nresearchers continue to develop innovative techniques for malaria\ndetection using hemozoin as a biomarker. Implementation of these methods\nwill require careful design with cost and equipment reduction in mind\nin addition to rigorous field evaluation.\n\nSchistosome\neggs are the most common biomarker for schistosomiasis detection.\nThey are produced by adult Schistosoma worm pairs that reside in the intestine and bladder and deposited\ninto the vessels of the gut wall.75 Many\neggs become permanently lodged in the intestine, liver, bladder, or\nurogenital system, leading to chronic inflammation and systemic tissue\ndamage;76 however, some mature eggs are\nexcreted in urine or feces to allow the parasites to continue the\ntransmission cycle.75 Eggs from distinct\nspecies are distinguishable by their morphologies. Differences include\nthe overall egg shape (round to oval), spine position, and extent\nof filamentous coating.77 All of these\nfeatures are observable by microscopy, which is the gold standard\nfor schistosomiasis diagnosis.\n\nVoided eggs from all Schistosoma species contain mature miracidia within\na relatively impermeable eggshell.75 While\nthe dense biopolymer composition of Schistosoma eggshells has been studied since the 1960s,78 the inorganic components of the eggshells were not investigated\nuntil 2007, when Jones et al.79 demonstrated\nthe presence of iron in Schistosoma japonicum eggshells (Figure 5A). The group used inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)\nand energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to provide evidence that\niron localized to the eggshell. Although these elemental characterization\ntechniques did not provide specific information about the oxidation\nstate or organization of iron present, the group found that the eggshells\ncontained 121 mg/kg (dry weight) Fe, making up nearly 89% of the iron\nfound in intact eggs.79\n\nIn the same year as the Jones\nstudy, Teixeira et\nal.80 set out to increase the sensitivity\nof microscopy\nfor Schistosoma detection using magnetic\nmicroparticles to enrich eggs from fecal samples. To accomplish this,\nstool samples were suspended in water and repeatedly sieved and washed\nbefore the sediment was incubated with magnetic particles that bound\nto the Schistosoma eggs. This technique\nfor egg concentration was dubbed the Helmintex method80 and was demonstrated to be more sensitive than Kato-Katz,\nthe current WHO recommended sample preparation method for schistosome\ndiagnosis in a field setting.81 The initial\nhypotheses of the Helmintex method were that biotinylated lectins\nwould bind to carbohydrates on the surface of Schistosoma\nmansoni eggs and that streptavidin-coated magnetic\nbeads could bind the biotin-lectin-egg complexes. Using an external\nmagnet, the eggs could then be isolated and concentrated before detection\nby microscopy. However, control experiments demonstrated the following:\n(1) lectins were not necessary for egg binding to magnetic particles,\n(2) nonmagnetic latex particles did not bind to S.\nmansoni eggs, and (3) the eggs alone did not migrate\nto an external magnet (Figure 5B).80 These observations, coupled\nwith the discovery of iron localized to eggshells, led some to hypothesize\nthat, in the presence of an external magnetic field, the paramagnetic\nbeads act as weak bar magnets, enabling attraction of the iron in\nthe shells of the eggs.82\n\nIn 2013,\nKarl et al.83 further probed\nthe iron distribution and magnetic properties of schistosome eggshells\nto elucidate the mechanism of the Helmintex method. The study found\nthat iron was localized to pores in eggshells, and schistosome eggs\ndemonstrated moderate paramagnetic behavior. However, the eggs did\nnot move in a magnetic field, and the paramagnetic particles bound\nto parasite eggs in the absence of a magnetic field, suggesting that\nthe mechanism of binding was not magnetic in origin.83 The authors also found that S. japonicum eggs bound more microparticles than S. mansoni, leading to the hypothesis that the filamentous outer structure\nof the eggs, more prominent in S. japonicum compared to S. mansoni eggs, provided\nstrong, nonmagnetic adhesion based on many relatively weak van der\nWaals interactions.83 In a separate study,\nCandido et al.84 also observed that S. japonicum eggs bound more microparticles than S. mansoni. The group used Poisson analysis and found\ntwo distinct populations within each species: a high \u201caffinity\u201d\ngroup and a low \u201caffinity\u201d group, where affinity was\ndetermined by the number of microparticles bound to the visible edge\nof a single egg. Interestingly, the magnitudes of the high affinity\nvalues were similar between the two species, but the fraction of eggs\nin the high affinity group for S. japonicum was greater than for S. mansoni.84\n\nCollectively, these results suggest that\ndifferences in filamentous\nmicrospines between the two species do not fully explain the mechanism\nof egg-microparticle binding. Additionally, the work by Candido et\nal. opens up many questions, the answers to which could greatly inform\nfurther optimization of the Helmintex method. For instance, what are\nthe physiochemical differences between high and low affinity egg groups?\nIs there a biological difference between the two groups, such as egg\nmaturity or surface antigen expression? Both the Karl et al. and Candido\net al. studies were performed on eggs isolated from livers of infected\nmice, but do these two egg populations appear in the urine or feces\nof infected humans? If so, should two types of magnetic microspheres\nbe used to ensure the Helmintex method captures all egg types present\nin a sample?\n\nThese questions should be answered carefully and\nsystematically.\nGiven the greater number of microspheres bound to eggs in the high\naffinity group, the populations should be separable using external\nmagnetic fields of differing strengths. Egg-microparticle binding\nmechanisms for each population could be interrogated by determining\nsolution properties (e.g., pH, salt, surfactant, chelators, blocking\nproteins, etc.) required to interrupt the interactions. Additionally,\nfunctionalizing microspheres in a way that systematically varies their\nzeta potential and hydrophobicity could determine the role these physiochemical\nproperties play in binding. These studies will be crucial if the Helmintex\nmethod aims to determine infection intensity using quantitative egg\nenrichment. This is particularly important for schistosomiasis surveillance\nand morbidity control campaigns, which aim to quantify and reduce\nthe prevalence of high-intensity infections.\n\nThe Helmintex method\noriginated with the idea that iron in the\neggshells of schistosomes could serve as a handle for magnetically\nenriching Schistosoma eggs for more\nsensitive detection in the field setting. While the Helmintex method\nhas already been shown to improve the sensitivity of Kato-Katz, elucidation\nand optimization of the true binding mechanisms could lead to an even\nmore impactful method for diagnosing low-intensity schistosomiasis\ninfections.\n\nCoordination\nchemistry, which is defined as the chemistry of metal atoms or ions\nthat form complexes with one or more ligands,86 can be utilized to coordinate biomarkers with a particular affinity\nfor metal ions. The most significant illustration of this capacity\nis the isolation of proteins via immobilized metal affinity chromatography\n(IMAC).87,88 This technique involves the conjugation\nof various ligands to a solid support matrix such as agarose, cellulose,\nor silica. These ligands act as Lewis bases, chelating metal ions\nwith a high affinity. The fixed metal ions serve as Lewis acids, coordinating\nto both the immobilized ligands and specific amino acid residues in\na protein biomarker.89 While amino acid\naffinities toward metal ions vary, histidine demonstrates a particularly\nhigh affinity toward metal ions in this format. These interactions\ncan be leveraged to isolate a biomarker from a complex biological\nmatrix. Once separated, the target can be competitively eluted and\nconcentrated into a smaller volume suitable for a POC diagnostic test.87,88\n\nThe choice of chelating ligand is critical to IMAC protein\nseparation efficiency. Ligands both fix the metal ion to the solid\nsupport and modulate metal-protein binding based on the number and\nconformation of chelation sites.88,90\u221292 A multitude of ligands with varying coordination numbers have been\nemployed. Most IMAC platforms contain tridentate or tetradentate chelators,\nalthough some bidentate and pentadentate options exist (Figure 6). Tetradentate nitrilotriacetic\nacid (NTA)93 and tridentate iminodiacetic\nacid (IDA)94 are two of the most common\ncommercial ligands, but many companies have also developed their own\nproprietary structures such as TALON95 or\nNi-Penta.96 The variety of chelating ligands,\nmany of which possess different coordination numbers, make IMAC tunable,\nwhich is beneficial when tailoring the chemistry to different diagnostic\napplications.87,88,97\u2212100\n\nGuided by Pearson\u2019s hard\u2013soft acid\u2013base\ntheory,\nnumerous metal ion and ligand combinations have been exploited in\nIMAC. Borderline acids such as Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ have predominated,86\u221288 displaying\nvarying levels of affinity and specificity. The determination of which\nion will be optimal in a given isolation often depends on the protein\nin question. Ni(II)-NTA has been one of the most widely utilized metal\u2013ligand\ncombinations in IMAC applications. Until recently, a thorough investigation\nthat compared divalent metals and their molecular recognition capability\nwas lacking.\n\nBauer et al.99 filled\nthis void by conducting\na systematic investigation of the affinity of malarial biomarker histidine-rich\nprotein 2 (HRP2) to M2+-functionalized biosensors and solid\nphase resins (M2+ = Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, or Zn2+). HRP2 is the most frequently detected\ntarget in malarial rapid diagnostic tests and possesses a unique primary\nstructure containing 35% histidine, making it an ideal histidine-rich\ntarget.101 The authors used biolayer interferometry\n(BLI), an optical biosensor technique, to determine kinetic constants\n(e.g., kon, KD) for the binding\nof the various metals to HRP2. The authors found that Co2+ and Zn2+ exhibited the fastest binding kinetics (highest kon) and the highest HRP2 binding affinity (lowest KD) on BLI biosensors.99 When the same IMAC complexes were incorporated into a loose solid\nphase resin, Zn(II)-NTA resulted in the fastest complete binding of\nHRP2 per mole of divalent metal while also allowing for the most efficient\nelution of HRP2 upon the addition of imidazole. Once a metal had been\nselected, HRP2\u2019s binding and elution behavior was evaluated\nagainst a variety of ligands and solid supports. The selected Zn(II)-IDA\nresin was then integrated into a pipet tip format, enabling direct\nHRP2 capture from spiked lysed blood samples. This field-deployable\nsample isolation and concentration tool displayed up to a 4-fold signal\nenhancement in commercial rapid diagnostic tests (Figure 7). This study99 demonstrated that optimizing the IMAC metal-ligand combination\nfor a particular application is critical for efficient biomarker capture\nand elution; the initial binding cannot be too tight so as to prevent\nbiomarker elution with a competing ligand (e.g., imidazole) nor too\nweak so as to attain suboptimal biomarker enrichment.88,99\n\nIMAC has been adapted to a variety of solid support platforms,\nfrom agarose gels to rigid silica particles.102,103 Although many of these platforms have become well-established research\ntools, the emergence of novel materials104\u2212108 has enabled IMAC chemistry in new applications. For example, Wang\net al.109 polymerized polyhedral oligomeric\nsilsesquioxanes (POSSs) into micron-sized particles with nanosized\npores, which were subsequently functionalized with IDA and charged\nwith Cu2+. This material was then used for specific capture\nof hemoglobin, which is rich in surface-exposed histidine residues.\nIncubation of the test solution with the Cu(II)-IDA functionalized\nmaterial enabled selective capture of hemoglobin versus other proteins\nwithout these accessible histidine residues.109 The development of this novel material using the principles of IMAC\ndemonstrates that nanomaterials can be modified for molecular recognition\nof histidine-rich proteins. These modified nanomaterials have the\npotential to be incorporated into POC diagnostic frameworks for biomarker\ncapture.\n\nIMAC-functionalized cellulose membranes could provide\nanother excellent\noption for sample preparation in low-resource settings. Given that\nthese membranes already hold an established place as a laboratory\nresearch tool, they could readily be incorporated into field-friendly\npaper fluidic devices. Opitz et al.110 utilized\ncommercial IDA-functionalized cellulose charged with Zn2+ as a platform for separating influenza virus particles from culture\nlysate. After an initial metal screening, they saw that Zn2+-charged membranes separated particles with significantly higher\naffinity the other metals tested. The authors postulated that the\ninfluenza hemagglutinin glycoprotein on the particular strain studied\n(influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34) contained histidine-rich Zn2+-coordinating sequences on each subunit and that the repeated\nconfiguration of these subunits as part of the capsid structure contributed\nto a higher overall binding avidity.110 Although this IMAC-based method for separating virus particles from\ncell culture was developed to improve the efficiency of laboratory-based\nresearch, it is not difficult to imagine extending this concept to\na simple sample preparation method for increasing the sensitivity\nof an influenza rapid test. Applying the developed protocol to a diagnostic\ntest would require feasibility testing on clinical patient samples,\nideally, resulting in the design of an integrated device for both\nsample preparation and virus detection. IMAC-functionalized cellulose\nmembranes present a unique advantage in relation to other materials\nbecause of the ease in which they can be incorporated into paper-based\ndiagnostic formats that are usable in low-resource POC settings.\n\nMagnetic\nparticles hold a number of advantages over other solid IMAC supports.\nThe increased surface area of the particles provides increased availability\nfor chemical reactivity and functionalization.111,112 The independent response of paramagnetic particles to an externally\napplied magnetic field enables active mixing, which has proven especially\nuseful in microfluidic applications. This magnetic susceptibility\nalso allows for easy manipulation of the particles once a targeted\nbiomarker is bound, permitting biomarker isolation and concentration\nbefore downstream detection.111,112 Multistep protocols\nthat would otherwise rely heavily on laboratory techniques such as\nfiltration, centrifugation, and column chromatography can easily be\nperformed using magnetic beads and a hand-held external magnet. Aside\nfrom chromatographic capabilities, magnetic particles have been employed\nas signal generation labels that are detected by inductive or magnetoresistive\nsensors. This application is discussed in detail in sections 4.2.6 and 5.4. Magnetic particles thus represent a promising vehicle for\nIMAC chemistries in low-resource settings.\n\nThe Wright research\ngroup recently demonstrated that IMAC-functionalized magnetic beads\nhave the potential to improve commercial POC diagnostic sensitivity\nfor malaria.113 HRP2 was captured from\nlarge-volume (100 \u03bcL whole blood samples diluted and lysed to\n200 \u03bcL) P. falciparum-spiked\nsamples via chelation to Ni(II)-NTA on the surface of commercially\navailable magnetic particles. Then, using a specially designed extraction\ncassette and a hand-held magnet, the HRP2-bound particles were guided\nthrough stationary liquid chambers separated by surface-tension valves\nto wash the sample and remove background. Once purified, the magnetic\nbeads with bound HRP2 were transferred to a final 10 \u03bcL elution\nchamber preloaded with imidazole to release the biomarker. This resulted\nin a 10-fold theoretical concentration factor for HRP2 due to the\ntransfer from a 100 \u03bcL blood sample to a 10 \u03bcL elution\nchamber. After extraction using this self-contained system, the authors\nadded the 10 \u03bcL elution volume to a variety of commercial HRP2-based\nmalaria rapid diagnostic tests and found significant signal enhancement\nacross all brands.113,114\n\nIn subsequent studies,\nthe group developed and optimized a hand-held,\neasy-to-use device85,115 (Figure 8A) in which HRP2-bound, IMAC-functionalized\nmagnetic beads were directly transferred to the sample pad of commercial\nmalaria lateral flow assays. The biomarker was eluted with an imidazole-spiked\nrunning buffer. As shown in Figure 8B, this device enabled highly sensitive HRP2 detection\nwith few added user steps, improving the detection limits of commercial\nmalaria tests by over an order of magnitude with minimal added cost\nper test.85,115 This enhanced sensitivity could\nmake a substantial difference in malaria elimination campaigns, which\nrely on detecting and treating all infected individuals, including\nlow-density carriers.\n\nOne of the primary limitations of IMAC chemistry is its ability\nto recognize only those proteins with affinities for metal ions. For\npurification of recombinant proteins from cell culture, this drawback\nhas been overcome via incorporation of short hexahistidine tags (His6-tags) into expressed protein sequences.116,117 Using a similar principle, Bauer et al.117 developed a platform in which target-specific antibodies modified\nwith His6-tags were combined with IMAC magnetic beads to\nisolate and concentrate biomarkers from biological samples. Thus,\nthe advantages of IMAC for biomarker enrichment were no longer limited\nto histidine-rich proteins but rather could be extended to any protein\nbiomarker target.\n\nIn the context of malaria diagnosis, this\nexpanded capability allows\nfor the detection of the nonhistidine-rich biomarker Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) alongside HRP2, which is beneficial for several reasons. Plasmodium LDH is essential to parasite survival\nand is conserved across all species of malaria known to infect humans,\nwhereas HRP2 is produced only by P. falciparum.118 In addition, HRP2-only tests fail\nto account for parasitic infections containing pfhrp2 gene deletions, which are increasing in prevalence worldwide.72 Finally, HRP2 has been shown to persist in host\ncirculation up to 52 days after successful treatment, but pLDH clears within 24 h after parasite clearance, so a dual\nassay can distinguish between resolved and active P.\nfalciparum infections.119\u2212122\n\nFor these reasons, Bauer\net al.117 employed\ntheir IMAC-based His6-tagged antibody approach to concentrate\nboth pLDH and HRP2 from large volume samples (200\n\u03bcL parasite-spiked whole blood) utilizing commercially available\nIMAC magnetic beads.117 In this dual capture\nsystem, HRP2 coordinated directly to the Co(II)-NTA-functionalized\nsurface of the magnetic bead, while pLDH was bound\nusing His6-tagged anti-pLDH antibodies\n(Figure 9). Following\nisolation of both biomarkers, HRP2 and the His6-tagged-antibody/pLDH complex were simultaneously eluted with imidazole.\nWhen applied to whole blood samples spiked with the P. falciparum parasite, this strategy resulted in\na nearly 20-fold improvement in the limit of detection of commercial\nLFAs.117 This unique platform demonstrates\nthat IMAC-based biomarker enrichment is not limited to histidine-rich\nproteins and could be expanded to virtually any biomarker for which\nthere is a commercially available antibody.\n\nOne of the challenges associated\nwith employing a His6-tagged antibody/IMAC concentration\nstrategy is that the biomarker\nremains bound to the antibody during the detection step. The antibody\nused for sample preparation has the potential to block target binding\n(via overlapping epitopes or steric effects) to the molecular recognition\nelements employed in the downstream assay, leading to false-negative\nresults. This challenge can be addressed by designing the diagnostic\nsuch that the His6-tagged antibody and downstream detection\nelements bind to orthogonal epitopes of the target. Furthermore, other\nHis6-tagged molecular recognition elements such as aptamers\ncould be used in place of His6-tagged antibodies. Aptamers\nare short, single-stranded nucleic acid sequences with secondary structures\nthat afford high (\u223cnanomolar\u2013picomolar) binding affinities.\nCompared to antibodies, aptamers are smaller and may target unique\nepitopes, potentially allowing for this innovative sample preparation\nstrategy to be more universally applied.123\u2212126\n\nCoordination chemistry-based sample preparation technologies\nhave\nenabled significant improvements in the sensitivities of point-of-care\ndiagnostics. The enhanced sensitivities, which in several examples\nwere improved by a whole order of magnitude, make a strong case for\nthe use of these technologies in elimination campaigns.85,115,117 Previously, biomarker enrichment\nstrategies were not incorporated into low-resource diagnostics because\nof the restrictive format of the tests. The IMAC-based chemistries\ndescribed in this section represent innovative yet simple solutions\nthat open the door for the development of POC diagnostics that incorporate\nsample preparation. While some of the sample preparation methods presented\nin this section increased the total number of assay steps, these methods\nwere not designed in tandem with the diagnostic devices that were\nutilized for detection. Moving forward, human-centered device design\nthat integrates sample preparation with detection elements will permit\nthe next generation of POC diagnostics to be developed with minimized\nuser steps and improved sensitivities.\n\nPhotoluminescent inorganic\ncomplexes possess unique properties and offer several advantages over\norganic fluorophores as signaling molecules for diagnostics. These\nadvantages include long-lived phosphorescence, significant Stokes\nshifts, and emission tuneability via ligand composition.137,158,159 Long-lived phosphorescence is\nbeneficial because it is spectrally distinct from the autofluorescent\nbackground of biological matrices, leading to improved sensitivity.158 The large Stokes shifts of metal complexes\nalso result in improved sensitivity because self-quenching of signaling\nmolecules is minimized.158 Additionally,\nthe tunable emissions of metal complexes enable their use as signal\ntransducers, whereby ligand exchange reactions that induce changes\nin emission spectra can be correlated to biomarker concentration.159 To date, cyclometalated d6 complexes\nof Ir(III) are the most commonly utilized photoluminescent signal\ngeneration probes.137\u2212139,141,142,160 Ligands in these cyclometalated\nIr(III) complexes (e.g., deprotonated 2-phenylpyridine) demonstrate\nstrong \u03c3-donor effects, which significantly increase the energy\nof the 1MC (metal-centered) excited state (i.e., the ligand\nfield stabilization energy) that gives rise to nonradiative decay\npathways. As a result, excited electrons in these complexes preferentially\npopulate the 1MLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) excited\nstate (as opposed to 1MC). The excited electrons then undergo\nintersystem crossing and subsequently phosphoresce from a mixture\nof the 3LC (ligand-centered) and 3MLCT excited\nstates (Figure 10).\nThe high phosphorescent quantum yields with large Stokes shifts make\nthese complexes ideal for signal generation.160,161\n\nDavis et al.138 designed a \u201cswitch-on\u201d\nIr(III) detection probe that selectively produced phosphorescent signal\nin the presence of malarial biomarker HRP2. The cyclometalated Ir(III)\ncomplex, [Ir(ppy)2(H2O)2]+, was poorly luminescent in the absence of HRP2; however, when aqua\nligands were displaced by HRP2\u2019s histidine residues, a biomarker-dependent 3MLCT/3LC phosphorescent signal was produced (Figure 11). Similar to the\nprinciples of IMAC chemistry discussed in section 3, this approach capitalized on the chelation\nof HRP2\u2019s histidine repeats to the inorganic coordination compound.\nThe assay design aptly showed how the tunable luminescence of Ir(III)\ncomplexes could be harnessed for signal transduction, demonstrating\nthat a ligand exchange reaction\u2019s phosphorescent signal could\nbe correlated to biomarker concentration. In addition, the Ir(III)\ncomplex displayed a significant Stokes shift (\u0394\u03bb = 145\nnm),138 making it less prone to self-quenching\neffects and decreases in sensitivity associated with its organic fluorophore\ncounterparts.162\n\nThis study138 also incorporated the\nIr(III) probe into an IMAC magnetic bead-based biomarker isolation\nand detection assay for recombinant HRP2 which had a detection limit\nof 14.5 nM. Although less sensitive than an ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay), this HRP2 concentration was within the relevant range for\nclinical diagnosis of malaria. Moreover, the bead-based assay could\nbe completed in less than 2 h, whereas traditional ELISAs require\n6\u20138 h. While the current assay format would only permit its\napplication in better-equipped laboratories, the developed cyclometalated\nIr(III) probe could be an exciting detection element in an LFA with\nHRP2-specific antibodies at the test line. However, this photoluminescence\ndetection mechanism is dependent on existence of a histidine-rich\nbiomarker, so further applications of this particular strategy are\nlimited.\n\nA more generalizable platform using photoluminescent\nIr(III) probes\nwas developed by Lin et al.139 for the\ndetection of interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), an inflammatory cytokine\nbiomarker for immunological diseases such as HIV. For molecular recognition\nand detection of IFN-\u03b3, the assay used two aptamers: one was\nhighly specific for IFN-\u03b3, and the second was a guanine-rich\nnucleic acid sequence. The two aptamers were designed to be partially\ncomplementary and were prehybridized prior to the introduction of\na sample containing IFN-\u03b3. In the presence of IFN-\u03b3, the\nIFN-\u03b3-specific aptamer bound to its target and liberated the\nguanine-rich sequence. Introduction of K+ ions induced\nthe formation of guanine quadruplexes, which subsequently bound an\nIr(III) probe for \u201cswitch-on\u201d luminescence that correlated\nbiomarker concentration with phosphorescent signal (Figure 12).\n\nThis Ir(III) probe possessed a long phosphorescence lifetime\n(>2.9\n\u03bcs) and significant Stokes shift (\u0394\u03bb = 215 nm),\nthus exhibiting the canonical advantages of inorganic probes over\norganic fluorophores. The assay demonstrated adequate specificity\nfor IFN-\u03b3 versus other proteins commonly found in biological\nmatrices (e.g., human serum albumin and immunoglobulins) and had a\nlimit of detection of 0.12 nM and a dynamic range of 1\u2013300\nnM. However, the assay suffered a reduction in sensitivity when conducted\nin a 0.5% cell extract, and no attempts were made in the complex biological\nmatrices that are pertinent to HIV diagnosis (e.g., blood, urine,\nsaliva, etc.). Nonetheless, the assay established a proof-of-principle\nfor using a photoluminescent cyclometalated Ir(III) complex as a detection\nprobe for an HIV biomarker.139 Moreover,\nthe assay format is generalizable such that it could be applied to\nvirtually any biomarker for which there is a high-affinity aptamer.\nIf combined with one of the sample preparation strategies discussed\npreviously (section 3) or integrated with paper or another field-ready substrate, this\nIr(III)-based detection strategy could produce a robust and sensitive\nassay that is applicable in low-resource diagnostic settings.\n\nDiagnostic assays with electrochemical\ndetection commonly consist of a three-electrode system: a working\nelectrode (often gold or carbon modified with a molecular recognition\nelement for biomarker capture), a counter electrode (typically platinum),\nand a reference electrode (commonly a saturated calomel electrode\nor Ag/AgCl electrode).171 In this format,\nincubation of a biological sample in an electrochemical cell initially\nresults in capture of the biomarker at the working electrode. Introduction\nof a biomarker-specific inorganic probe and a supporting electrolyte\nand subsequent application of an electrochemical method (e.g., cyclic\nvoltammetry, square wave voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry,\namperometry, etc.) results in significant current production at the\nworking electrode. This current can then be correlated to biomarker\nconcentration. With regard to infectious disease biomarker detection,\nhemin, Ir(III) complexes and Ru(II) complexes have been utilized as\nelectrochemical probes.144\u2212146\n\nHemin (ferriprotoporphyrin\nIX) is a Fe3+-containing porphyrin derivative that mimics\nthe enzymatic activity of horseradish peroxidase in catalyzing the\nreduction of H2O2 (see section 4.3). This enzymatic activity is further enhanced\nwhen hemin is incorporated into a G-quadruplex aptamer.143,144,172 Zhang et al.144 developed an electrochemical assay for the detection of\nHIV-associated IFN-\u03b3 that utilized hemin as a key component\nof the signal generation mechanism. A 3\u2032-thiolated DNA construct\nwas conjugated to a gold working electrode, where the DNA construct\ncontained a G-quadruplex sequence that was specific for hemin and\nan IFN-\u03b3-specific aptamer. Both the G-quadruplex and the IFN-\u03b3-specific\naptamer were prehybridized by an 8-nucleotide hairpin. The authors\nutilized this functionalized working electrode to perform cyclic voltammetry\non samples containing IFN-\u03b3 to monitor the reduction of H2O2, which could be correlated to IFN-\u03b3 concentration\n(Figure 13).\n\nIn samples containing IFN-\u03b3, the IFN-\u03b3-specific\naptamer\nbound to IFN-\u03b3, opening the hairpin and subsequently allowing\nfor hemin to bind to the G-quadruplex. The potential sweep catalyzed\nthe reduction of H2O2 by the hemin/G-quadruplex\nDNAzyme, producing a cathodic current that was proportional to the\nconcentration of IFN-\u03b3 in the sample. The assay yielded a detection\nlimit of 0.1 nM and a dynamic range of 0.1\u2013120 nM144 and thus performed similarly to the luminescent\nassay developed by Lin et al.139 (section 4.1.1). Though\nthe authors demonstrated the specificity of the assay for IFN-\u03b3\nversus nontarget proteins BSA and IgG, they did not report whether\nthe assay could be performed in more complex matrices, which can significantly\ncompromise assay performance. More rigorous testing of the assay in\nbiological matrices is therefore needed to demonstrate the robustness\nof the assay.\n\nMiao and colleagues145 synthesized and\nimplemented an Ir(III) complex-based electrochemical probe for detection\nof IFN-\u03b3 (Figure 14). First, a gold working electrode was functionalized with\na molecular beacon (MB) that contained an IFN-\u03b3-specific aptamer\nas well as a sequence that was partially complementary to a second\noligonucleotide strand (H1). In the absence of IFN-\u03b3,\nthe portion of the MB complementary to H1 was hybridized\ninto a hairpin structure. When IFN-\u03b3 bound to the aptamer, the\nH1 sequence was freed and available to hybridize with its\ncomplement, H2. The developed Ir(III) probe then bound\nto the major and minor grooves of the H1\u2013H2 double helix. Oxidation and reduction of the 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione\nligand via differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) resulted in IFN-\u03b3\nconcentration-dependent current, thus correlating an electrochemical\nsignal to the presence of target biomarker.\n\nThe electrochemical assay had\na detection limit of 16.3 fM and\na dynamic range of 50 fM\u20133.0 pM and could be conducted in samples\nthat were 5.0% human serum. Importantly, this assay yielded an \u223c7000-fold\nimprovement in limit of detection compared to the two previously discussed\nassays for detection of IFN-\u03b3.145 This is largely due to the signal amplification that resulted from\nthe groove-binding of numerous Ir(III) probes to the H1\u2013H2 double helix, which provided multiple signal-generating\nelements for every one IFN-\u03b3 biomarker bound. In its present\nform, this assay could not be applied in a primary healthcare setting\nbecause it utilizes an electrochemical workstation that requires trained\npersonnel and significant laboratory resources. However, a portable\nelectrochemical detection system such as the one described in section 5.5(173) could allow for this highly sensitive assay\nto be applied in a POC setting.\n\nSimilar to most electrochemical\nassays, ECL systems employ a working electrode that is functionalized\nwith a target-specific molecular recognition element. The potential\nmanipulation is similar to voltammetric measurements; however, in\nECL, the applied potential also generates an excited state in the\nECL probe, which then produces luminescence upon relaxation.149,165 The canonical probe for ECL-based detection is [Ru(bpy)3]2+, a complex (or derivative thereof) which has been\nused extensively in the development of ECL-based sensors for infectious\ndisease detection.150\u2212154,156 In diagnostic assays, ECL with\n[Ru(bpy)3]2+ occurs primarily through a coreactant\nmechanism, where the coreactant is most commonly n-tripropylamine (TPrA) (Figure 15). In coreactant ECL, simultaneous oxidation of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ to [Ru(bpy)3]3+ and TPrA\nto oxidized TPrA ([TPrA\u2022]+) is followed by deprotonation\nof [TPrA\u2022]+. An electron is then transferred from\nTPrA\u2022 to [Ru(bpy)3]3+ to form a 3MLCT excited state [Ru(bpy)3]\u20222+ that is analogous to the 3MLCT state that is populated\nthrough absorption of a photon. The triplet excited state then undergoes\nphosphorescent decay to the ground state, allowing for luminescent\ndetection of target biomarkers.149 Of the\nvarious mechanisms for electrogeneration of a luminescent excited\nstate, coreactant ECL has proven to be the most advantageous for the\ndevelopment of diagnostic assays because it permits measurements that\ncan be obtained in aqueous solvents and matrices.\n\nOne platform for detection of infectious diseases,\npioneered by\nYoon et al.,150 used immunoliposomes to\nencapsulate ECL signal generation probes. Liposomes equipped with\na maleimide handle were synthesized by the freeze\u2013thaw method\nand loaded with [Ru(bpy)3]2+. The maleimide-functionalized\nliposomes were then conjugated to thiol-activated antibodies specific\nfor the target antigen. The resulting immunoliposomes then served\nas a target-specific reagent containing an ECL probe that could be\nreleased with the application of detergents such as SDS or Triton.\n\nThe authors150 incorporated the [Ru(bpy)3]2+-loaded immunoliposome into a membrane strip\ntest for detection of the Legionella antigen. The strip test contained the following components: (1)\na nitrocellulose membrane impregnated with Legionella antigen, (2) a glass fiber pad presoaked in SDS, and (3) screen-printed\nelectrodes that could interface with an ECL analyzer. The immunoliposomes\nwere incubated with a buffer solution containing the Legionella antigen, and then the sample solution\nwas allowed to wick up the nitrocellulose strip. Both the antigen\nin the sample and the antigen embedded in the nitrocellulose competed\nfor binding with the immunoliposome. In positive samples, the immunoliposome\nwas bound by the Legionella antigen\nin solution and migrated past the nitrocellulose strip to the glass\nfiber pad. The SDS in the glass fiber pad lysed the immunoliposome,\nreleasing [Ru(bpy)3]2+, which was detected by\ncoreactant ECL and correlated to the antigen concentration (Figure 16).\n\nThe assay could be completed in\n20 min and had a limit of detection\nof 2 ng/mL.150 Compared to a traditional\nlateral flow assay, the test required additional user manipulation\nsteps (preincubation of the sample and immunoliposome, addition of\ncoreactant, etc.). The assay was also dependent on a benchtop ECL\nanalyzer and, therefore, ill-suited to a Level 1 healthcare setting\nin its current format. However, this novel platform demonstrated the\ncapabilities of ECL for detecting a target antigen and showed how\na [Ru(bpy)3]2+-loaded immunoliposome could be\nutilized to amplify signal. Variations of this loaded immunoliposome\nplatform have since been applied to the detection of the influenza\nvirus biomarker hemagglutinin.151,152\n\nRecently, Zhou\net al.153 developed an\nECL-based immunosensor for p24, a HIV biomarker associated with early\nstage infection and detection of which promotes earlier intervention\nin HIV cases. The detection probe in this assay was a nanocomposite\nconsisting of gold nanoparticle-decorated graphene (P-RGO@Au) and\n[Ru(bpy)3]2+-doped silica nanoparticles (Ru-SiO2) (Figure 17). A gold nanoparticle-modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE) was\nfunctionalized with an anti-p24 antibody (Ab1) for molecular recognition\nof p24. A second anti-p24 antibody (Ab2) conjugated to the P-RGO@Au@Ru-SiO2 nanocomposite was used as the detection element. Once the\nAb1-p24-Ab2 sandwich was formed on the electrode, coreactant n-tripropylamine (TPA) was added to produce the ECL signal\nthrough the mechanism previously discussed.149 The P-RGO@Au@Ru-SiO2 nanocomposite offered several benefits\nto the system, namely an increased surface area for the ECL reaction\nand an increased rate of electron transfer. The SiO2 nanoparticles\npermitted greater [Ru(bpy)3]2+ loading, and\nthe gold nanoparticle-graphene composite increased loading of the\n[Ru(bpy)3]2+-doped SiO2 nanoparticles.\nThe authors contended that these aspects led to an increased concentration\nof ECL-probe at the working electrode surface, which ultimately improved\nthe assay\u2019s detection limit (LOD = 1.0 pg/mL) and linear range.\nAdditionally, the authors demonstrated that the p24 antigen could\nbe detected in diluted human serum.153\n\nA remaining challenge\nfor developing luminescent, electrochemical,\nand ECL assays that incorporate inorganic complexes is thorough validation\nin complex biological matrices and clinical samples. The aforementioned\nluminescent assays138,139 were not rigorously evaluated\nin biological samples. This is an important consideration in developing\nluminescent assays because of the high background that can result\nfrom the presence of interferents in biological samples. Biofouling\nof electrodes is a known challenge in developing electrochemical sensors\nas well.174,175 Although several of the previously\nmentioned electrochemical and ECL assays were tested in dilute biological\nmatrices,145,153 a more thorough evaluation of\nhow the biological matrix affects the limit of detection is still\nneeded. However, the issue of interference and biofouling could potentially\nbe addressed by integrating these detection platforms with the metal-based\nsample preparation strategies discussed in section 3, resulting in more robust and sensitive\nassays.\n\nInorganic complexes have demonstrated promise for detection\nof\ninfectious disease biomarkers. The luminescent, electrochemical, and\nECL detection platforms discussed in this section all capitalized\non the unique properties that result from the interplay between ligands\nand metal centers. However, inorganic complexes are rarely used as\nstand-alone probes for biomarker detection. Instead, inorganic nanoparticles\nhave emerged as the predominant probes in infectious disease diagnostics.176,177 Integration of inorganic complexes with nanomaterials represents\na potential avenue to developing the next generation of detection\nprobes. One interesting nanomaterial that incorporates inorganic complexes\nis the metal\u2013organic framework (MOF), which is a nanosized\nnetwork of organic ligands and metal ion/complex connecting points.178,179 The ligands provide functional handles for the conjugation of molecular\nrecognition elements, while signal-generating metal complexes are\ninstalled at the connecting points or encapsulated within the network.\nRecently, electrochemical aptasensors have been developed that contain\naptamer-conjugated MOFs for specific recognition and detection of\nvarious protein or small molecule targets.180\u2212182 Moreover, two of the complexes discussed in this section, Ir(ppy)3 and [Ru(bpy)3]2+, have already been\nincorporated into MOFs for sensing and imaging applications.183,184 By integrating molecular recognition elements into the MOF architecture,\nthe applications of these Ir(III)- and Ru(II)-based MOFs could be\nfurther expanded to include luminescent, electrochemical, or ECL detection\nof infectious disease biomarkers.\n\nGiven the prevalence of carboxylates\nand primary amines on nanoparticle surfaces and molecular recognition\nelements, one of the most common bioconjugation strategies for generating\nfunctionalized nanoparticle detection probes is the formation of amide\nbonds. The conventional reagent for forming amide bonds on nanoparticle\nsurfaces is 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl) carbodiimide (EDC),\nwhich produces an activated ester that can subsequently react with\na primary amine. However, alone, the EDC-activated ester reacts slowly\nwith amines, often leading to hydrolysis products that inhibit amide\ncoupling. For this reason, EDC is usually paired with sulfo-NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) esters to improve the stability of\nthe activated ester intermediate. The sulfo-NHS ester-activated intermediate\nreadily reacts with primary amine nucleophiles to form stable amide\nlinkages (Figure 18A).190,191\n\nEDC/Sulfo-NHS coupling\nis useful in generating both antibody- and\nnucleic acid-nanoparticle conjugates as diagnostic detection probes.\nDue to the intrinsic abundance of primary amines in antibodies, they\nare readily conjugated to carboxylate nanoparticles without the need\nfor initial derivatization.188,192 EDC coupling with\nimidazole enables conjugation of ethylene diamine to the 5\u2032\nphosphate group of nucleic acids, yielding 5\u2032-amine-functionalized\noligonucleotides that can be coupled to carboxylated particles.193 Quantum dots, magnetic nanoparticles, and polymeric\n(latex) particles have found applications in POC diagnostics and are\ncommonly equipped with carboxylates or amines on the surface to enable\nconjugation via EDC coupling. Quantum dots are conventionally stabilized\nby dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) derivatives or various copolymers that\ninstall a carboxylate on the surface, and magnetic nanoparticles are\ncoated with carboxylate-containing polymers to enable further functionalization\nwith primary amine-containing biomolecules.188,194\u2212196\n\nAlternatively, both quantum dots and\nmagnetic nanoparticles can\nbe coated with a silica shell derivatized with carboxylate or amine\nfunctional groups. Silica nanoshells are formed via the condensation\nof silica oxide monomers, such as tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS)\nor 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES), yielding surface aminopropyl-silanols\n(Figure 18B). The\nsurface of the silica can subsequently be coupled to molecular recognition\nelements via EDC.188 In addition to supplying\nfunctional groups for further bioconjugation, the silica encapsulation\nof other nanoparticles provides biocompatibility and protects the\ncore material from degradation, making it a suitable strategy for\nthe preparation of diagnostic nanoparticle detection probes.197\n\nThe other significant reaction class\nfor generating nanoparticle\ndetection probes is the bioconjugation of thiols present either in\nmolecular recognition elements or on nanoparticle surfaces. Thiolated\nnucleic acids are prepared by the same method as amine-functionalized\nnucleic acids, except cystamine is used in place of ethylene diamine\nfor the addition of a disulfide that can be reduced with dithiothreitol\n(DTT) to give a 5\u2032-thiolated oligonucleotide probe.193,198 On the other hand, antibodies generally do not contain free thiols\nand, therefore, either have to be thiolated (often with Traut\u2019s\nreagent) or cleaved at the interchain disulfides (via DTT or papain)\nto generate thiols for subsequent bioconjugation to a nanoparticle\nsurface.192,198\n\nCoupling of thiolated\nbiomolecules to noble metal nanoparticles\n(referring to gold and silver nanoparticles) is conventionally done\nvia coordinate covalent (dative) bonds, where the lone pairs of the\nsulfur atoms form stable linkages directly to the nanoparticle surface\n(Figure 18C).188,191 Alternatively, thiol-containing affinity reagents or nanoparticles\ncan be coupled via a maleimide-derived heterobifunctional cross-linking\nagent, commonly sulfo-SMCC (succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate).\nThiols react with the maleimide functionality of sulfo-SMCC to form\nstable thioethers, whereas the NHS-ester component of sulfo-SMCC reacts\nwith primary amines in molecular recognition elements or on nanoparticle\nsurfaces (Figure 18D).191,194,195,197\n\nPhotochemical cross-linking and \u201cclick\nchemistry\u201d\nhave also been utilized to produce nanoparticle-based detection probes.\nPhotosensitive functional groups, including phenyl azides and diazirines,\ngenerate reactive nitrenes and carbenes, respectively, upon exposure\nto UV light and allow for insertion into carbon\u2013hydrogen and\nnitrogen\u2013hydrogen bonds (Figure 18E). Photochemical agents can be integrated\ninto heterobifunctional cross-linkers, such as sulfo-NHS-LC-diazirine,\nfor conjugation of nanoparticles to molecular recognition elements.191,199,200 \u201cClick\u201d chemistry\ngenerically refers to bioorthogonal reactions with high yields, minimal\nside products, and mild conditions. While the most common \u201cclick\u201d\nreaction is the conjugation of an azide to an alkyne in the presence\nof a Cu(I) catalyst (Figure 18F), there are many classes of \u201cclick\u201d reactions\nthat couple nanoparticles and molecular recognition elements.191,201\u2212205\n\nThe predominant affinity-based\nconjugation strategy for nanoparticle functionalization is the biotin\u2013streptavidin\nsystem. Biotin is a small molecule that binds with an extraordinarily\nhigh affinity (KD = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u201315 M) to the bacterial protein streptavidin.206 Streptavidin is an approximately 60 kDa tetrameric\nprotein, permitting a 4:1 stoichiometry of biotin to streptavidin.206 In general, streptavidin is added to the nanoparticle\nsurface via passive adsorption or a heterobifunctional cross-linker\nsuch as sulfo-SMCC. The most common method for biotinylating a molecular\nrecognition element is the coupling of sulfo-NHS-biotin or NHS-(PEG)n-biotin to a primary amine. Although streptavidin\u2013biotin\nbioconjugation is generally easy, a (PEG)n spacer may be included to optimize for the depth of the streptavidin\nbinding pocket (9 \u00c5) as well as the low relative solubility of\nbiotin.206\n\nCharacterization of nanoparticle\nconjugates is essential for determining the success and extent of\nparticle functionalization, which can drastically affect particle\nperformance in a diagnostic format. There are several characterization\ntechniques applicable to the development of detection probes for diagnostics.\nUV\u2013visible spectroscopy (UV\u2013vis) is one of the most\ncommonly used methods for biomolecule-functionalized nanoparticles\ngiven its simplicity and applicability to the detection of nucleic\nacids and proteins.207,208 Particle size and distribution\ncan be assessed using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission\nelectron microscopy (TEM),209\u2212211 while functional group characterization\non the nanoparticle surface can be evaluated with NMR and/or infrared\n(IR) spectroscopy.212\u2212215 All of these analytical methods have trade-offs with respect to\ncost, sensitivity, time of analysis, and complexity of sample preparation.\nHowever, because many of the techniques offer complementary information,\nthey can be used in combination to ensure an extensive characterization\nof inorganic nanoparticle detection probes.\n\nThe principal concern\nassociated with antibody modification is decreased antigen-binding\nactivity as a result of overfunctionalization of the variable region\nof the antibody. Optimization of the bioconjugation reaction minimizes\nthis effect by achieving a balance between sufficient nanoparticle\ncoupling efficiency and retention of antigen binding. The extent of\nantibody modification can be monitored with functional group-specific\nchromophores that are detectable by UV\u2013vis, such as Ellman\u2019s\nreagent for free-thiol detection or HABA (4\u2032-hydroxyazobenzene-2-carboxylic\nacid) for biotin detection.192,198 Also, biosensor techniques,\nsuch as surface plasmon resonance (SPR), quartz crystal microbalance\n(QCM), and BLI, can be employed to assess the impact of modification\non the binding affinity for the antigen.216\u2212218\n\nDecreased target affinity can also originate from suboptimal\nloading\nof antibody or nucleic acid on the nanoparticle surface. Insufficient\ncoverage may lead to the nonspecific binding of interferents, whereas\noverloading the nanoparticle with molecular recognition elements can\nresult in steric effects, decreasing target binding. Simple absorbance-based\nsupernatant assays that measure antibody or nucleic acid concentration\nboth before and after nanoparticle functionalization reactions give\nan estimation of the element\u2019s surface density and aid in determining\nthe nanoparticle surface saturation.207,208 The straightforward\nnature of these procedures make them popular strategies for characterizing\nthe extent of functionalization of nanoparticle conjugates for use\nin infectious disease diagnostics.\n\nThe bioconjugation chemistry\nfor attaching a molecular recognition\nelement to a nanoparticle surface is the key component for transforming\na nanoparticle with interesting signaling properties into a functional\nreagent that can be employed in diagnostic assays. The characterization\nof the nanoparticle postfunctionalization is critical to ensuring\noptimal signal in downstream diagnostic application. Several classes\nof functionalized nanoparticles can be utilized in developing POC\ndiagnostics for infectious disease, the choice of which depends on\nthe use-case scenario and desired signal output. Sections 4.2.2\u20134.2.6 describe the fundamental principles and POC\napplications for these classes of nanoparticles.\n\nBoth\ngold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), collectively\nreferred to as noble metal nanoparticles, possess many unique properties\nthat make them advantageous probes for signal generation in infectious\ndisease diagnostics. Noble metal nanoparticles display a vivid color\nthat is observable with the naked eye due to surface plasmon resonance\n(SPR). The phenomenon of SPR, illustrated in Figure 19A, occurs when incoming photons strike the\nnanoparticle surface and generate a dipole that causes electron oscillations\n(i.e., surface plasmons) with a frequency that resonates with the\nfrequency of the incoming light. Visible light fulfills this resonance\ncondition for noble metal nanoparticles, giving rise to large molar\nextinction coefficients (on the order of \u223c109 M\u20131cm\u20131) at visible wavelengths.219 Moreover, a nanoparticle\u2019s color and\n\u03bbmax can be manipulated by controlling its size (Figure 19B).220,221 Noble metal nanoparticles are also easily functionalized with antibodies,\naptamers, or oligonucleotide probes to afford specificity to a target\nbiomolecule.177,188 Altogether, these qualities\nhave made noble metal nanoparticles a frequent choice for colorimetric\nlabels in diagnostic assays designed to be interpreted by the naked\neye.\n\nIt is important to note\nthat we have limited further discussion\nof AuNPs since their use in diagnostics and sensing applications has\nbeen extensively reviewed.177,219,222\u2212226 Given the vast literature that exists for AuNP applications, we\nhave elected to focus on the applications of AgNPs as signal generation\nprobes for infectious disease diagnosis. Similar to AuNPs, localized\nSPR of AgNPs has been capitalized upon to develop colorimetric assays\nfor infectious disease protein and nucleic acid biomarkers.227\u2212231 Additionally, the conjugation of fluorescent probes (e.g., FAM)\nto AgNP surfaces, as well as the intrinsic luminescence of some AgNPs,\nhas permitted the development of luminescence-based assays.232,233 The high AgNP conductivity has also been exploited for electrochemical\ndetection of nucleic acids.234\u2212236 Lastly, surface-enhanced Raman\nspectroscopy (SERS) of AgNPs has been employed for the direct detection\nof malaria-infected red blood cells because of the significant light\nscattering of AgNPs and the high specificity of Raman signatures.69,237\u2212240\n\nColorimetric detection using nanoparticles in paper-based\nassays\nhas been a widely implemented method for signal readout in primary\nhealthcare settings. In fact, the success of lateral flow assays can\nbe credited in part to the nanoparticle-based detection systems that\nallow for visual interpretation of results by the end user. The use\nof functionalized AgNPs as colorimetric detection probes in paper-based\ndiagnostics for infectious disease has been reported for both protein\nand nucleic acid biomarkers.227,241 For example, Yen et\nal.229 employed AgNPs in a multiplexed\nlateral flow assay for detection of dengue, yellow fever, and Ebola\nvirus. The authors synthesized 30-, 41-, and 47 nm AgNPs, which were\nvisually detectable as orange, red, and green, respectively, due to\nsize-dependent SPR shifts. Each nanoparticle of a particular size\nwas specifically functionalized with a distinct target-specific antibody\nassociated with one of the viruses, allowing for detection of all\nthree diseases in a single assay (Figure 20). The detection limit for each biomarker\nwas found to be 150 ng/mL, which is within clinically relevant ranges\nfor each disease but is higher than other published methods.242,243 Such multiplexed diagnostic assays are critical for discriminating\nbetween febrile illnesses at the point of care to allow for selection\nof the appropriate treatment course.\n\nColorimetric AgNP aggregation assays also rely on the size-dependence\nof SPR. When AgNPs aggregate, the decrease in distance between nanoparticles\nresults in interparticle SPR, producing a large red-shift in absorption\nand distinct color change that is visible to the unaided eye.222,227 These reaction mechanisms are classified as either \u201ccross-linking\u201d\nor \u201cnon-cross-linking.\u201d In cross-linking assays, AgNPs\nare functionalized with both molecular recognition elements and capping\nligands that stabilize the nanoparticles in solution. Addition of\na sample of target biomarker results in cross-linking of the functionalized\nnanoparticles, drastically decreasing the nanoparticle\u2013nanoparticle\ndistance and producing in a spectral shift.244,245 AgNP aggregation assays in this format have been implemented for\ndetection of both infectious disease protein228 and nucleic acid230 biomarkers; however,\nto the best of our knowledge, cross-linking-based AgNP aggregation\nhas yet to be employed in paper diagnostics or other low-resource\nplatforms.\n\nIn non-cross-linking aggregation assays, nanoparticles\nare either\naggregated or stabilized with molecular recognition elements that\nelectrostatically adsorb to the nanoparticle surface. Subsequent addition\nof a sample containing the diagnostic target then either disrupts\nor promotes nanoparticle stabilization, producing an observable color\nchange.222 For example, Teengam et al.231 developed a non-cross-linking aggregation assay\nusing AgNPs for multiplexed visual detection of Middle East respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and human papillomavirus oligonucleotides in a microfluidic paper\nanalytical device (\u03bcPAD). The assay lacked the sensitivity required\nfor detection of pathogenic nucleic acids; however, most sensitive\nnucleic acid diagnostics incorporate amplification techniques (e.g.,\nPCR) that require extensive resources and infrastructure only available\nin better-equipped laboratories.246 Nonetheless,\nthe use of a AgNP aggregation-assay in a \u03bcPAD enabled multiplexed\nvisual detection of three different nucleic acid biomarkers in a format\nthat could be applicable to a primary healthcare setting.\n\nTaking\nadvantage of the intrinsic fluorescence of some AgNPs, Kurdekar\net al.233 developed a fluorescent immunoassay\nfor detection of p24 that utilized a streptavidin-coated AgNP as the\ndetection probe. Using a standard well-plate immunoassay format, adsorbed\nanti-p24 antibodies captured p24 from samples. A biotinylated anti-p24\ndetection antibody and the streptavidin-conjugated fluorescent AgNP\nwere subsequently added to generate a fluorescent signal that correlated\nwith p24 concentration. The assay successfully detected p24 standard\nspiked into plasma as well as the p24 present in HIV-positive patient\nplasma samples. Moreover, no cross reactivity was observed in samples\nthat were HIV-negative but HBV- or HCV-positive. The limit of detection\nof the assay was 10 pg/mL, which is an order of magnitude higher than\na previously discussed assay for p24 (section 4.1.2).153 This\ndiscrepancy could be explained by the lack of signal amplification\nin the fluorescent AgNP-based immunoassay. In its current format,\nthe fluorescent AgNP immunoassay is not amenable to a resource-limited\nprimary healthcare setting; however, fluorescent AgNPs could be employed\nin a lateral flow assay format and combined with a portable fluorescent\nreader, allowing for implementation at the point of care.247\n\nQuantum dots\n(QDs) are semiconductor nanocrystals with luminescent and conductive\nproperties that make them advantageous as detection probes in infectious\ndiseases diagnostics. Canonically, QDs consist of combinations of\nelements from groups II and VI or groups III and V and range in size\nfrom 1 to 100 nm.248,249 At these small sizes, QDs absorb\nphotons, generating excited electrons in the conduction band and positively\ncharged holes in the valence band of the semiconductor (Figure 21A). The distance\nthat separates the electron\u2013hole pair is confined to less than\nthe diameter of the nanocrystal, resulting in \u201cparticle in\na box\u201d behavior known as quantum confinement.249\u2212251 As a result of quantum confinement, QD emission wavelength increases\nas nanoparticle size increases; thus, QD emission can be tuned via\nsize-controlled synthesis (Figure 21B).252 Because QDs exhibit\nabsorption across a broad spectrum yet have emission spectra with\nvery narrow and tunable bandwidths, they are particularly useful for\nmultiplexed detection of disease biomarkers.194,253 Additionally, QDs demonstrate increased biocompatibility, photostability,\nquantum yield, and semiconducting properties compared to traditional\norganic fluorophores, further rendering QDs advantageous as signal\ngeneration probes for diagnostics.254\u2212256 QDs have been employed\nfor the detection of biomarkers for Ebola virus,257 tuberculosis,258,259 HIV,253,258,260 malaria,261\u2212264 avian influenza virus,265Escherichia coli,266 and\ncholera267,268 in fluorescent assays for laboratory and\nresource-limited settings.\n\nFunctionalized QDs or\nQD-loaded microparticles have been utilized\nas fluorescent probes for both protein and nucleic acid biomarkers.194,256,269 The surface of QDs can be functionalized\nwith antibodies or antigens for protein detection or oligonucleotide\nprobes for target DNA detection using the bioconjugation strategies\ndiscussed in section 4.2.1. For a thorough evaluation of the bioconjugation of QDs,\nthe reader is directed to a number of reviews.194,196,270 Goldman et al.271,272 pioneered the earliest uses of antibody-functionalized QDs as fluorescent\ndetection probes. The authors utilized affinity-based coupling chemistry\n(i.e., biotin\u2013avidin) as well as electrostatic interactions\nbetween charged moieties to functionalize antibodies to the metal\nsurfaces of CdSe/ZnS core\u2013shell quantum dots. The biotin\u2013avidin\nsystem was found to be the more simple, reproducible, and robust method\nfor QD bioconjugation of the two, and these functionalized QDs were\nsuccessfully utilized in a multiplexed fluorescent assay for cholera\ntoxin and staphylococcal enterotoxin B.272 These early works exploited the narrow emission profile and enhanced\nquantum yield of QDs for antigen detection and laid the groundwork\nfor the development of enhanced, fluorescence-based diagnostics for\na variety of targets.\n\nBuilding upon this previous work, Klostranec\net al.253 constructed a multiplexed fluorescence-based\nmicrofluidic device for detecting HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis\nC antibodies utilizing antigen-functionalized QD barcode particles.\nTwo types of CdSe/ZnS QDs were synthesized and loaded into polystyrene\nbeads at varying ratios, resulting in three distinct QD barcode particles.\nEach QD barcode particle was covalently bound to a disease-specific\nantigen via EDC coupling. The assay employed a \u201csandwich\u201d\nformat where disease-specific antibodies were captured by the antigen-functionalized\nQD barcode particles, and a fluorophore-conjugated (AlexaFluor 488)\nantihuman antibody was used to detect the presence of a target antibody.\nThe narrow peak width of QD emission enabled detection of both the\nantibody-conjugated fluorophore at \u223c520 nm to indicate the\npresence of target antibody as well as both of the QDs at 570 nm (yellow)\nor 615 nm (red). The ratio of the red:yellow signal intensity allowed\nfor barcode identification and determination of which of the three\ntarget antibodies was present (Figure 22).253\n\nThe detection limits\nfor antibodies correlating to all three diseases\nwere in the picomolar range, which is a 50-fold improvement compared\nto commercial ELISAs.253 While the assay\nenabled multiplexed and sensitive detection of infectious disease\nbiomarkers, the microfluidic platform employed by the authors required\nextensive user manipulations and complex instrumentation and analysis\nthat would only be viable in higher level healthcare settings. Given\nthe improvements in sensitivity of the assay, adaptation of the technique\nto a hand-held fluorimeter or cell phone-adapted fluorescence device\ncould potentially allow for deployment in a primary healthcare low-resource\nsetting. The benefit of this strategy is that the biomarker signal\nand barcode signal are both fluorescence-based, resulting in a multiplexed\ndetection platform that is simplified compared to assays with different\ndetection schemes for biomarkers and barcodes. The authors hypothesized\nthat up to 106 barcode combinations are theoretically possible\nusing this approach due to the narrow and distinct fluorescent peak\nwidths generated by different QD particles, allowing for even greater\nmultiplexing.253 However, such hypotheses\nshould be approached with caution, as highly multiplexed assays can\nbe more susceptible to cross-reactivity, thereby reducing the diagnostic\nspecificity of the individual assays.\n\nQD-loaded particles have\nalso been functionalized with antibodies\nfor the detection of protein biomarkers for infectious disease. Recently,\nHu et al.257 developed a lateral flow assay\nthat utilized antibody-coated polymeric particles (260.9 nm) loaded\nwith both QDs (3\u20136 nm) and AuNPs (20 nm) for detection of Ebola\nvirus (EBOV) glycoprotein. The reporter probes, which the authors\ndubbed \u201cdual signal readout nanospheres\u201d (RNs), enabled\ndetection of the EBOV glycoprotein either visually via AuNPs or fluorescently\nvia QD emission. Characterization of the RNs revealed that there were\ndozens of AuNPs adsorbed and hundreds of QDs embedded per every one\nantibody-coated polymeric particle (Figure 23, panels A and B); thus, for every one biomarker\narrested at the test line, there were significantly more signaling\nmoieties to permit more sensitive detection. Additionally, two sets\nof antibody-functionalized RNs were fabricated and used for each LFA:\n(1) streptavidin-conjugated and (2) biotin-conjugated RNs. Application\nof the sample and streptavidin-conjugated RNs to the sample pad resulted\nin migration of the sample and RNs to the test line and formation\nof an antibody \u201csandwich\u201d at the test line. Subsequently,\nthe biotin-conjugated RNs were added and bound to the streptavidin-coated\nRNs, enhancing the signal based on the high affinity of the biotin\u2013streptavidin\ninteraction.\n\nThe authors257 utilized the LFA to detect\neither the EBOV glycoprotein or the whole virion spiked into samples.\nThe assay demonstrated a broad dynamic range that spanned 3 orders\nof magnitude for detection of AuNPs with a limit of detection by visual\ninspection of 2 ng/mL. When the QD fluorescence signal was used, the\ndetection limit was improved to 0.18 ng/mL (Figure 23, panels C and D). The fluorescent detection\nof this assay was 1\u20132 orders of magnitude more sensitive than\n2 commercial brands of rapid tests for EBOV glycoprotein. Moreover,\nthe fluorescent signal could be quantitated by image processing software\nthat is readily available on a smartphone. Though the authors utilized\na benchtop fluorimeter for QD excitation and emission, the use of\na smartphone adapted hand-held fluorimeter or dedicated fluorescent\nlateral flow reader could enable measurements at the point of care.257 The sensitive dual signal readout provides\nversatility to this platform such that it could be employed in a number\nof use-case scenarios. If morbidity control were the primary concern,\nvisual detection of AuNPs would suffice. If more sensitive and quantitative\nmeasurements were needed for surveillance, intervention management,\nor an elimination campaign, the fluorescent capabilities of the detection\nprobes could be exploited. However, for a given use-case scenario,\nlikely only one signal readout modality is needed. As a consequence,\nthe additional cost of implementing a dual signal RN, when using a\nsingle signal (visual or fluorescent) RN would suffice, needs to be\nconsidered. Nonetheless, the assay demonstrated that quantum dots\ncould be incorporated into tests that are readily deployable in primary\nhealthcare settings, though more rigorous field evaluation and validation\nof the assay would be necessary for clinical use.\n\nThere have\nbeen significant advances in the use of QD-based detection\nmethods for infectious disease biomarkers. While the complexity of\ninstrumentation required for detecting quantum dots is often still\na barrier to their implementation at the point of care, developments\nin smartphone-based devices are currently enabling the detection of\nfluorescent labels such as QDs at the point of care.273\u2212275 Fluorescent assays have demonstrated a capacity for multiplexing.\nBecause of the narrow emission profiles demonstrated by QDs, the potential\nfor continued expansion in multiplexing likely lies with QD-based\nfluorescent assays. Given the importance of detecting comorbidities\nand coinfections or discriminating between febrile illnesses,276,277 the QD-based technologies represent a platform that has the potential\nto make a significant impact at the point of care.\n\nNanoparticles\ndoped with lanthanide chelates are advantageous as\ndetection labels owing to their large Stokes shifts, sharp emission\npeaks, stable luminescence, long fluorescence lifetime, and biocompatibility.278,279 In a lateral flow assay format, these particles are often functionalized\nwith target-specific antibodies and then embedded in the conjugate\npad of the test. Like QDs, detection of lanthanide chelate-doped nanoparticles\nrequires additional instrumentation for particle excitation and measurement\nof emission.280,281 Despite this need for additional\nequipment, these particles are attractive labels for POC diagnostics\nbecause they enable highly sensitive biomolecule detection. In the\ncontext of elimination or surveillance of a particular infectious\ndisease, the added sensitivity provided by lanthanide chelate-doped\nnanoparticles could allow for detection of low-intensity infections\nthat would otherwise be missed.\n\nExcept lanthanum, all lanthanides\nare f-block elements; the 4f orbital is gradually filled as the atomic\nnumber increases. Because the 4f orbital is largely shielded from\nthe chemical environment by the filled 5s and 5p shells, the lanthanides\nare very similar in their chemical properties. For example, the most\ncommon oxidation state for aqueous lanthanide ions is +3.282,283 Most of these ions are luminescent, though some lanthanides have\ngreater quantum yields than others due to the large energy gaps between\nthe lowest emissive energy level and the highest sublevel of the ground\nstate. As the size of the energy gap increases, lanthanide ions become\nless prone to lower energy nonradiative decay processes, resulting\nin greater quantum yields.278 Eu3+ is the most commonly utilized lanthanide for labels in lateral flow\nassays because of its (1) ideal energy gap between the nondegenerate\nemissive state of 5D0 and the ground state of 7FJ and (2) convenient emission in the visible region.\nConsequently, Eu3+ will be the focus of this section.279\n\nEuropium(III) itself is not strongly\nluminescent because most excitations\ninvolve forbidden electric dipole f-f transitions, which have low\nabsorption cross sections.278 However,\nthis can be overcome when the ion is coordinated to a sensitizing\nstructure, such as an organic ligand. A simplified Jablonski diagram\nof the luminescence process for a Eu3+ chelate is depicted\nin Figure 24. The\nligand absorbs the excitation energy and transfers it to a triplet\nstate (T1) via intersystem crossing (ISC). Next, this energy\nis transferred to one of the 5DJ levels of Eu3+, and, after internal conversion (IET), emission occurs from\nthe 5D0 energy level to any of the 7FJ levels.278,279\n\nIn addition to sensitization, chelating ligands\nalso promote luminescence\nby shielding Eu3+ from aqueous quenching effects and allow\nfor coupling to biomolecules or polymeric materials.278 Chelating ligands typically absorb in the UV (330\u2013370\nnm), and the subsequent Eu3+ emission occurs at 580\u2013690\nnm.279 Ligands usually contain a chromophore\nportion (e.g., pyridine, salicylate, phenanthroline, coumarin, pyrazole,\ntriphenylene, and quinolone) and a chelating structure based on multidentate\npolyacids or macrocycles (e.g., EDTA).278 Tetracycline has also been employed as a ligand for Eu3+.284\n\nThese chelate dyes are incorporated\ninto nanoparticles functionalized\nwith target-specific molecular recognition elements for use in lateral\nflow assays. Most lateral flow assays that employ Eu3+ chelates\nuse commercially available particles, which are often superior due\nto their monodispersity and quality control standards. The majority\nof commercially available Eu3+ chelate lateral flow labels\nare 100\u2013300 nm carboxyl- or streptavidin-decorated polystyrene\nparticles and are readily available from large vendors such as ThermoFisher285 and Expedeon Ltd.286 Eu3+ chelates are easily adsorbed into polymeric (e.g.,\npolystyrene) nanoparticles based on hydrophobic interactions between\nthe polymers and the organic chelating ligands of the complexes. For\nexample, Huhtinen et al.287 found that\nsimply incubating 50 nm polystyrene particles with Eu3+ chelated with dipicolinic acid derivative ligands resulted in 1000\u20132000\nchelates per nanoparticle. This represents a density of approximately\n0.02 chelates/nm3. H\u00e4rm\u00e4 et al.288 found a similarly high density of approximately\n0.05 chelates/nm3 (31000 chelates/particle) in 107 nm commercially\navailable particles. Thus, for each biomolecule bound in a lateral\nflow format, thousands of associated Eu3+ chelates produce\na signal, resulting in a highly sensitive measurement.\n\nThe advantages\nof Eu3+ chelate-loaded polystyrene nanoparticles\nas labels for lateral flow assays were demonstrated by Yeo et al.,289 who developed a sensitive lateral flow assay\nfor the detection of avian influenza H7 subtype virus. These viruses\ncan be highly pathogenic; for a 2013 H7N9 outbreak in China, a mortality\nrate of roughly 36% was estimated for hospital patients with laboratory-confirmed\ninfections.290 Currently, laboratory-based\nmolecular testing is required to differentiate between H7 subtype\navian influenza and other viral infections. Thus, there is a need\nfor rapid tests that can be performed at the point of care. The authors\napproached this problem by developing and evaluating a panel of 10\nH7 subtype-specific monoclonal antibodies against hemagglutinin 1\nof H7N9 influenza. After the best antibody pair was determined, H7\nsubtype-specific lateral flow assays were constructed with both europium-chelate\nand gold nanoparticle (AuNP) conjugates. Using a benchtop time-resolved\nfluorescence reader, the authors found that the detection limits for\nthe Eu3+ chelate-based tests were 25-fold better than those\nof AuNP-based tests. Additionally, the developed Eu3+-based\ntests performed better than commercially available tests detecting\ninfluenza A nucleoprotein.289 These enhancements\nover gold particles are impressive, although given the high density\nof chelates per nanoparticle, it is surprising that larger enhancements\nwere not achieved. One possible explanation could be the efficiency\nof molecular recognition element adsorption for the two types of nanoparticles.\n\nIn addition to avian influenza,289,291 Eu3+ chelate-embedded polymeric nanoparticles have been employed for\nthe detection of E. coli,292 hepatitis B,293 and\nprocalcitonin,281 a host marker for bacterial\ninfections. Several commercial platforms based on these particles\nhave been developed as well, including the Sofia Influenza A+B tests\n(Quidel, Inc.)294\u2212299 and the aQcare Chlamydia TRF test (Medisensor, Inc.),300,301 which have been extensively evaluated in the literature. The high\nsensitivity of these assays is derived not only from the high number\nof Eu3+ chelates embedded in the polymeric nanoparticles\nbut also from the use of time-resolved fluorescence measurements.\nOne of the primary disadvantages of using luminescent probes as labels\nin lateral flow assays is the high autofluorescence of biological\nsamples and assay components occurring at excitation and emission\nwavelengths similar to those of the probes.302 This fluorescence can interfere with lateral flow readings, causing\nhigh background that leads to low-sensitivity measurements. However,\nlanthanide chelates overcome these effects because their fluorescence\nlifetimes are several orders of magnitude longer than conventional\nfluorescent materials (microseconds or milliseconds compared to nanoseconds).278,279 This allows for the use of time-resolved measurements in which samples\nare excited with a pulse of UV light, and emission signal is collected\nafter a time delay on the order of 100 ns for a given time period.284 By delaying the collection of emitted signal,\nthe short-lived autofluorescence from biological and assay components\nis excluded from measurements. While the intensity of the delayed\nluminescence is slightly decayed from the initial signal output of\nthe chelates, these measurements can be cycled to improve signal-to-noise.303 Of course, the unique instrumentation required\nfor time-resolved measurements makes field-deployment technically\nchallenging, though currently available benchtop devices could allow\nfor measurements in district clinics and laboratories. Recently, Paterson\net al.304 developed a promising smartphone-based\nplatform for time-resolved luminescent measurements, which could allow\nfor point-of-care measurements based on Eu3+ chelate particles.\nHowever, the lengthy 100 ms time-delay employed in their device is\nonly compatible with the most persistent luminescent nanophosphors\nsuch as crystalline SrAl2O4:Eu2+,Dy3+ particles.\n\nWhile polymeric Eu3+ chelate\nnanoparticles are the primary\nmaterials employed by lanthanide-labeled lateral flow assays, these\nparticles present some disadvantages. Their large size and tendency\nto swell can cause aggregation in aqueous solutions. Additionally,\nsince they are not covalently bound to the polymers, Eu3+ chelates can leach from the particles.284 Silica particles avoid some of these problems. In one example, Xia\net al.305 developed a lateral flow assay\nfor hepatitis B detection using Eu3+ chelate-loaded silica\nnanoparticles. To synthesize these particles, the authors relied on\nan iterative method involving silica condensation from TEOS, surface-amination\nusing APTMS, covalent functionalization of chelating ligands to the\nparticles, and loading of Eu3+. This process was repeated\nfive times to achieve a high density of Eu3+ chelates.\nThe resulting 55 nm nanoparticles contained a remarkable 686000 chelates/particle,\ncorresponding to a density of roughly 7.9 Eu3+ chelates/nm3, more than 100 times greater than commercially available\npolymeric particles.306 These particles\nwere then functionalized with oxidized dextran to serve as a hydrophilic\nlinker, and free amine moieties on antihepatitis B surface antigen\n(HBsAg)-specific antibodies were coupled to the surface via reductive\namination of the aldehyde groups.\n\nAfter synthesis and characterization,\nthe particles were used as\nlabels in a traditionally formatted lateral flow assay for HBsAg.\nTo measure signal, the strips were illuminated with a UV lamp and\nimaged using a digital camera. Signal intensity was determined using\nimage analysis in Adobe Photoshop. Unlike the previous example presented,\nthis imaging technique does not take advantage of the long fluorescence\nlifetime of Eu3+ chelates. However, even without time-resolved\nmeasurements, the detection limit of the LFA was found to be 30 pg/mL\nHBsAg, 100-fold better than a similarly formatted gold-based lateral\nflow assay.305 The study was then validated\nby analyzing 286 clinical serum samples using the developed Eu3+ chelate-based lateral flow assay as well as a quantitative\nELISA. The two methods were concordant for all samples analyzed and\nhad similar sensitivities.305 Thus, the\ndeveloped method represents an innovative tool for diagnosis of hepatitis\nB and provides sufficient sensitivity when compared to clinical methods.\nIn order to implement this assay directly at the point of care, two\nmodifications are necessary: (1) the assay should be optimized for\nfield-friendly whole-blood specimens, and (2) a mobile phone-based\ndetection strategy should be implemented.\n\nLanthanide chelate-based\nnanoparticle probes are a promising avenue\nfor developing highly sensitive lateral flow assays. Similar to other\nfluorescent probes, instrumentation remains the primary barrier to\nimplementation of Eu3+ chelate nanoparticles at the point\nof care. However, as optical devices are miniaturized and become more\naffordable, these probes could become commonplace among rapid tests\nfor infectious diseases.\n\nUp-converting phosphor (UCP) nanoparticles\nrepresent a unique and\nexciting reporter technology for bioassays. Unlike typical fluorescent\nlabels, these ceramic nanoparticles doped with rare earth elements\nabsorb low-energy IR radiation and emit higher-energy visible light.307\u2212309 UCPs are often superior to conventional colorimetric and fluorescent\nreporters for a number of reasons. First, the high anti-Stokes shift\nfrom IR to visible does not occur in nature. Thus, the inherent autofluorescence\ntypically associated with biological samples and assay components\ndoes not interfere with UCP measurements. Second, UCP signal is highly\nstable and does not photobleach, allowing for indefinite storage and\nrepetitive analysis of a single test. This is especially useful for\nconfirming field results in a central laboratory.309 Third, assays are easily multiplexed; distinct particles\nabsorb at the same IR excitation energy and emit wavelengths defined\nby the dopant. Finally, optical detection of UCP particles offers\nan inherent boost in analytical sensitivity over visual detection\nof gold; as few as 10\u2013100 UCP particles can be detected at\nthe test line of a lateral flow strip, while approximately 40000 gold\nparticles are needed for visual detection.310 This increase in sensitivity makes UCP particles attractive labels\nfor diagnostic tests employed in surveillance or elimination campaigns\nin resource-limited settings, since they would enable the detection\nof low-intensity or asymptomatic infections. However, similar to QDs\nand lanthanide-chelate particles discussed in the preceding sections,\nthese benefits of UCP particles must be weighed against the additional\ncost and resource requirements needed for detection instrumentation.\n\nThe primary mechanisms for up-conversion include excited state\nabsorption, energy transfer, and cooperative sensitization. Excited\nstate absorption is the absorption of light by electrons already in\nan excited state. This requires two photons and equal separation between\nthe ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of\na single ion. Energy transfer up-conversion requires two ions, a sensitizer\nand an activator. In this process, the sensitizer ion is excited and\nsequentially transfers its energy to the ground state and first excited\nstate of the activator ion.307 Cooperative\nsensitization is similar to energy transfer, though it involves excitation\nof two sensitizer ions which simultaneously transfer their energy\nto the activator ion. Other up-conversion mechanisms include photon\navalanche and cross relaxation.311\n\nEnergy transfer up-conversion is the most common up-conversion\nmechanism for bioassay reporter particles, which typically involve\na Yb3+ sensitizer (excitation 980 nm) and a rare earth\n(Er3+, Tm3+, Pr3+, Ho3+, and Gd3+) activator codoped in yttrium fluoride (YF3), yttrium oxide (Y2O3), yttrium oxysulfide\n(Y2O2S), or sodium yttrium fluoride (NaYF4) crystals.307,309 An illustration of the up-conversion\nprocesses for two of these materials are shown in Figure 25.\n\nUCPs have been utilized as labels\nfor both protein and nucleic\nacid targets in lateral flow assays for a variety of infectious diseases.\nRecently, Corstjens et al.312\u2212317 developed an ultrasensitive, UCP-based lateral flow assay for schistosomiasis\nthat detects Schistosoma circulating\nanodic antigen (CAA), a proteoglycan biomarker waste product produced\nby the parasite. CAA is present in the serum and urine of patients\nwith Schistosoma infections of all\nknown species and has been found to correspond well with worm burden,\nclearing soon after successful treatment.312,317,318 The developed lateral flow assay\nemployed 400 nm Y2O2S:Yb3+, Er3+ UCPs, which are excited at 980 nm and emit at 550 nm (green)\nand can detect CAA for a single Schistosoma worm pair in serum.314,317 This assay has been applied\nto patient samples from endemic areas, and due to its superior sensitivity,\nit has demonstrated much higher schistosomiasis prevalence than microscopy,\nserology, and nucleic acid-based tests.315\u2212317,319\n\nThe CAA lateral flow assay\nformat is similar to conventional lateral\nflow assays. CAA-specific antibodies are printed on the test line,\nand antimouse IgG is printed on the control line. The workflow of\nthe assay in its current form, however, differs from a typical field-ready\ntest. First, a trichloroacetic acid (TCA) extraction is performed\non a urine or serum sample, requiring a centrifugation step. The extract\nsupernatant is then combined with running buffer and anti-CAA-functionalized\nUCP particles and incubated for 1 h on an orbital shaker at 37 \u00b0C\nbefore the lateral flow strip is added to the solution. The test is\nallowed to develop and must dry completely (at least 3 h) before scanning\nand analyzing the strip.312,313 In order to simplify\nthe preparation procedure and decrease the number of steps, a dry\nreagent kit was later developed in which all buffers and particles\nwere lyophilized.313 This kit was shipped\nto a tertiary lab in South Africa, where nearly 2000 samples were\nevaluated by local technicians using both the kit and a CAA ELISA.\nThe researchers found that the UCP-based LFA successfully identified\nmore low-level infections than the CAA ELISA.320\n\nTo increase the analytical sensitivity of the assay,\nCorstjens\net al.317 added a spin-filter concentration\nstep to the sample preparation method. This allowed for CAA in urine\nsample volumes of 0.5\u20137.5 mL to be concentrated into 20 \u03bcL\nbefore addition to the lateral flow strip. The resulting detection\nlimits improved as sample volume increased, reaching as low as 0.03\npg/mL for the 7.5 mL assay. To demonstrate clinical applicability,\nthe concentration step was successfully performed on 2 mL patient\nurine samples from Kenya (high-endemic, S. mansoni) and China (low-endemic, S. japonicum)316,317 It is important to note that, though this\nsample concentration step improved the sensitivity of the assay, it\nrequired laboratory equipment to carry out; all patient samples in\nthese studies were processed in well-equipped laboratories. Further,\nthe additional concentration step increased the cost of this ultrasensitive\nCAA assay, though sample pooling could make this test more cost-effective\nand allow for monitoring of worm burdens at the subpopulation level\nfor large-scale surveillance.320 For this\nUCP-based ultrasensitive assay to be utilized in a field setting,\na more robust, field-ready sample preparation method is needed.\n\nLateral flow assays with UCP reporters have also been developed\nfor detection of protein markers of other infectious diseases, including\nneurocysticercosis,321 tuberculosis,322,323 leprosy,324\u2212328Yersinia pestis,329,330Brucella,331Vibrio anguillarum,332 hepatitis B,333 respiratory\nsyncytial virus,334 and HIV.335 Additionally, UCP-based multiplexed lateral\nflow assays have been developed for detection of protein biomarkers\nfor multiple infectious diseases.336,337 These multiplexed\ndiagnostics typically consist of one strip with multiple test lines,\neach capturing a distinct protein biomarker. In this format, the UCP\ncrystals are the same for each biomarker, though they are functionalized\nwith target-specific antibodies. One disadvantage of highly multiplexed\nassays on a single strip is the potential increase in cross-reactivity\nand nonspecific binding that could lead to false-positive results.\nTo mitigate this risk, Hong et al.330 developed\na unique, circular cassette with 10 channels for 10 different singleplex\nlateral flow assays using UCP particles as the reporter labels. One\nunexplored application of multiplexed detection on a lateral flow\nassay is the use of UCP particles with identical excitation but differing\nemission profiles. This could be particularly advantageous for large\nbiomarkers with multiple accessible epitopes and could provide additional\nclinical information. For example, an assay that captures and detects\nwhole organisms could include a second UCP probe for detecting surface\nproteins that confer drug resistance, providing both detection and\nsusceptibility results in one assay.\n\nUCP nanoparticles have\nalso been used in nonlateral flow diagnostic\nformats, including immunohistochemistry,338 microarrays,339 magnetic bead assays,340,341 and plate immunoassays,309 though these\nplatforms are not readily amenable to low-resource, point-of-care\nsettings. Even in the lateral flow format, UCP nanoparticles present\ninteresting challenges for field deployment. Clearly, sample preparation\nmethods, including purification, concentration, and amplification,\nmust be adapted for environments lacking controlled laboratory conditions\nand should rely on as little electricity as possible. While hand-powered\ncentrifuges342,343 and battery-powered mixers115,344 have been developed, the ideal POC assay will be optimized to preclude\nthese additional resources. Another issue, often unaddressed, is that\nthe lateral flow strips must be completely dry before optical measurements\nand analysis. This is because water also absorbs in the near-IR, decreasing\nexcitation efficiency of the sensitizer.345 Typically, protocols require at least 3 h of drying time after the\nlateral flow assay has developed, a long time-to-result for a point-of-care\ntest. Finally, detection of UCP particles relies on optical instrumentation.\nAlthough the most sensitive of these devices are benchtop instruments,\nportable battery-powered devices have been developed, such as the\nUCP-modified version of Qiagen\u2019s ESEQuant lateral flow reader\n(\u201cUCP-Quant\u201d).313,314,346\n\nMany of the sample preparation methods described in section 3 can be applied\nto UCP lateral\nflow formats. Additionally, innovations in hand-held optical readers\ndiscussed in section 5 require only simple adaptations to detect the anti-Stokes shift\nof UCP particles. There are clear advantages of using UCP nanoparticles\nas labels in lateral flow assays, including their inherently low background\ninterference and high analytical sensitivity. Innovations in sample\npreparation methods and the development of portable optical readers\nwill allow for these advantages to be exploited in low-resource, POC\nsettings.\n\nWhile most\nfrequently used for sample preparation and biomarker enrichment, magnetic\nnanoparticles are emerging as promising labels in POC assays. Similar\nto noble metal nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles can be easily\nfunctionalized and possess strong optical absorbance, which has led\nto their use as visual labels on lateral flow assays.347 However, their magnetic properties can also\nbe leveraged for detection, which has advantages over traditional\noptical detection in a lateral flow format. First, when visual or\noptical detection of absorbent or fluorescent particles is employed,\nonly signal from the surface (\u223c10 \u03bcm) of the membrane\nis measurable due to the opacity of the membrane. Typically, nitrocellulose\nmembranes used in LFAs are 100\u2013200 \u03bcm thick, so optical\ndetection only allows for signal from the top 10% of the membrane\nto be measured. In contrast, magnetization measurements can be performed\nregardless of the opacity of the substrate, taking advantage of the\nentire volume of the test line on a lateral flow assay.348 In addition, metal-oxide nanoparticles are\nhighly stable, and drying and aggregation do not influence the intensity\nof magnetic measurements.349 Finally, there\nare very few biological or assay components that interfere with magnetic\nmeasurements.350\n\nThe properties of\nmagnetic particles are size- and temperature-dependent.195,351 Iron oxide (typically magnetite or maghemite) particles are the\nmost common magnetic nanoparticles employed in diagnostic applications.\nIn the bulk, these materials are ferri- or ferromagnetic and thus\nretain magnetization after an external field has been applied. This\nhysteresis reaches a maximum when particle size is decreased to the\npoint that the material becomes single-domain. As particle size is\neven further reduced, the hysteresis effect decreases until the particles\nreach a critical diameter, below which Brownian forces are strong\nenough to overcome magnetic forces. Thus, at these small sizes, the\nparticles are superparamagnetic; the magnetic moments of the particles\nare aligned in the presence of an external magnetic field, but they\nrevert back to a nonmagnetic state when the field is removed.351\n\nIn the lateral flow format, magnetic\nnanoparticles are labeled\nwith target-specific molecular recognition elements and employed as\nconjugates for analyte detection.352 Superparamagnetic\nbehavior is ideal for particles applied as labels for lateral flow\nassays because the lack of magnetization in the absence of an external\nfield allows for the particles to wick along the strip without aggregating\ndue to magnetic effects.353 Then, the magnetic\nproperties of the particles can be leveraged after labels have bound\nto the test and control lines. Magnetic nanoparticles are typically\ndetected on lateral flow assays based on induction (Figure 26) or using magnetoresistive\nsensors.350 In the inductive format, which\nemploys the principles of Faraday\u2019s Law, a magnetic particle-based\ntest is placed in an oscillating magnetic field above a set of induction\ncoils. In the absence of magnetic particles, the net current induced\nin the coils is zero. However, when particles are present, the direction\nof their magnetic moments oscillates with the external magnetic field,\nresulting in a measurable net voltage induced across the coils that\nis proportional to the total number of particles at the test or control\nline.354,355 In contrast, magnetoresistive sensors are\nbased on the principle that the electrical resistance of certain materials,\nwhich are incorporated in the sensors, can change upon application\nof an external magnetic field.350 In this\nformat, a magnetic field is applied to para- or superparamagnetic\ndetection elements in order to align their magnetic moments and produce\na fringe field. Magnetoresistive sensors are placed close enough to\nthe particles to detect the fringe field they produce based on the\nchange in resistance of the materials within the sensor.356,357 A detailed description of the instrumentation required for these\ndetection methods is provided in section 5.4.\n\nMagnetic nanoparticles have been employed as detection labels\nin\nlateral flow assays for protein and whole-cell targets. For example,\nHandali et al.349 developed two magnetic\nparticle-based lateral flow assays for detection of Taenia solium, a cestode that is prevalent around\nthe world for which swine are intermediate hosts. When contaminated,\nundercooked pork is ingested, the parasites develop into tapeworms\nin the human gut (taeniasis). However, if eggs are ingested, the larval\nstage can infect the human nervous system, potentially forming cysts\nin the brain. This severe form of the disease, called neurocysticercosis,\nis a leading cause of epilepsy worldwide.358 The gold standard for diagnosis of taeniasis is observation of eggs\nin stool by microscopy, though this method is insensitive and labor-intensive.\nDiagnosis of neurocysticercosis currently requires CT scans of the\nbrain, a technology that is unavailable in low-resource settings.359 As such, there is a pressing need for T. solium rapid diagnostic tests.\n\nHandali et\nal.349 developed two serological\nmagnetic bead-based lateral flow assays that detected the immune response\n(i.e., host antibodies) against taeniasis-specific (ES33) and cysticercosis-specific\n(T24) antigens. For each test, one batch of the recombinant antigen\nwas printed at the test line, and a separate batch was coupled to\ncommercially available carboxylated superparamagnetic particles via\nEDC/NHS chemistry. The recombinant antigen at the test line and the\nantigen conjugated to magnetic particles were able to simultaneously\nbind to host antibodies in the sample, taking advantage of the multivalent\nnature of anti-ES33 and anti-T24 IgM and IgG antibodies.\n\nThe\nlateral flow assays were evaluated using an induction-based\nreader and visual reading to detect antibodies in serum samples from\nendemic areas and nonendemic control regions (Figure 27).349 It was\nfound that the taeniasis-specific ES33 assay had a diagnostic sensitivity\nand specificity of 95% and 96%, respectively, when evaluated with\nthe magnetic reader. The sensitivity and specificity of the neurocysticercosis\nT24 test using the magnetic reader were 94% and 99%, respectively,\nfor patients with two or more viable cysts as determined by CT scan\nor MRI of the brain. For patients with only one viable cyst, the T24\nassay only identified 5/15 cases of neurocysticercosis, indicating\nthat the burden of infection was not great enough to elicit an immune\nresponse.349 Despite this decrease in sensitivity\nfor single-cyst infections, the developed lateral flow assays are\npromising alternatives to the current gold standards. Further, because\nthe assays were not species-specific, they could be used to detect\nporcine cysticercosis as a marker of disease control and transmission.\nOne disadvantage of utilizing superparamagnetic labels is that many\nmagnetic readers are benchtop devices requiring electricity and a\nlaboratory setting. However, in over 70% of the cases, the magnetic\nnanoparticles could be detected visually.349 While this sensitivity is not ideal, it is possible that initial\nvisual results could be applied in the field with follow-up laboratory-based\nmeasurements assessed for the visually negative assays. As hand-held\nmagnetic readers become more commonplace, these assays will become\ntruly impactful.\n\nIn addition to T. solium, magnetic\nparticles have been employed in protein-detecting lateral flow assays\nfor HIV360,361 and H1N1 influenza.362 Whole cell-detecting magnetic particle-based assays have\nalso been developed for a number of targets, including Vibrio parahemolyticus,363,364Listeria monocytogenes,365 and Bacillus anthracis.366,367 The demonstrated sensitivity of these magnetic\nparticle-based lateral flow assays makes them promising alternatives\nto traditional assays with colorimetric or fluorescent labels. However,\ncurrent instrumentation, which will be discussed further in section 5.4, limits their\nutility at the point of care. One exciting avenue that has yet to\nbe explored for infectious disease detection is the employment of\nthe same superparamagnetic nanoparticles for dual purposes: immunomagnetic\nbiomarker enrichment from large-volume samples and visual labeling\nfor lateral flow assays. Ideally, such a diagnostic would integrate\nsample preparation and assay into one device. Once developed, the\ncombined effects of target enrichment and magnetic detection could\nlead to a highly sensitive test capable of detecting low-density infections.\n\nMetalloenzyme-antibody conjugates have been widely implemented\nin ELISAs for the detection of protein biomarkers for disease. This\nis due to the sensitivity afforded by the use of enzymes for signal\namplification as well as the specificity of the antibody\u2013antigen\ninteractions used for molecular recognition.371,377,378 Despite the high sensitivities\nof ELISAs, their application in POC settings is limited by several\nfactors:378\u2212381 signal readout for ELISAs typically requires a spectrophotometer\nunavailable in a primary healthcare setting, though there are a growing\nnumber of portable alternatives382 (e.g.,\ncellphones or hand-held scanners; see section 5.1.3). ELISAs are time-consuming (\u223c6\u20138\nh), demand extensive sample handling and solution manipulation, and\noften require specialized training. Lastly, the lack of thermal and\nlong-term stability of metalloenzymes in ELISAs can lead to suboptimal\nassay performance, as ELISAs are intrinsically dependent on these\nmetalloenzymes for signal amplification and readout. Thus, ELISAs\nare usually limited to well-equipped tertiary laboratories. To mitigate\nthese issues, investigators have begun to use paper as the ELISA solid\nsupport, increasing the likelihood that these sensitive assays could\nbe used in resource-limited settings. Paper-based ELISAs have been\ndeveloped for detection of diagnostic markers of HIV and malaria.381,383,384 Long-term stabilization conditions\nof metalloenzymes on paper have also been investigated to maximize\ncatalytic activity in POC settings.385\u2212387\n\nPaper-based ELISAs\nseek to address many of the issues that inhibit the use of ELISAs\nin more resource-limited POC settings. The time to result for paper-based\nELISAs is \u223c1 h due to the comparatively smaller volumes required\nwhen contrasted with conventional benchtop ELISAs. These smaller reagent\nvolumes also significantly reduce the overall cost of ELISAs. Cheng\net al.381 first pioneered this method for\nthe detection of serum antibodies against HIV-1 envelope antigen gp41,\nwhere an ALP-antibody conjugate was utilized to turn over BCIP/NBT\nsubstrates to purple precipitate products. The authors used hydrophilic\npaper that was patterned with hydrophobic photoresist to fabricate\n96 test \u201cwells\u201d that were spatially separated just as\nin a polystyrene 96-well plate. Samples containing biomarker were\nadded to the paper ELISA card, which was placed on top of a blotting\npad to enable wicking of the reagents through the test wells. Though\nthe assay boasted a faster time to result and a lower cost than the\nanalogous conventional ELISA, the sensitivity of the paper-based ELISA\nwas decreased by an order of magnitude compared to the conventional\nELISA format.\n\nLathwal and Sikes383 conducted a systematic\ninvestigation of several signal amplification methods for paper-based\ncolorimetric detection of malarial biomarker HRP2. To investigate\nmultiple metalloenzyme\u2013substrate combinations, the same capture\nantibody was immobilized on aldehyde-modified cellulose for all experiments,\nand the following detection systems were evaluated: (1) HRP with substrates\nDAB and H2O2, (2) HRP with substrates TMB and\nH2O2, (3) ALP with substrates BCIP and NBT,\n(4) Ag deposition onto AuNPs, and (5) polymerization-based amplification.\nBecause all factors (i.e., capture antibody, capture antibody loading,\nbiomarker, detection antibody) were held constant, the differences\nobserved in each assay were presumed to be the direct result of the\nsignal amplification system used. Positive and negative controls were\nevaluated at various time points for each signal amplification method\nto determine an optimal window for visual readout of the signal (Figure 28).383\n\nAll of the methods had an optimal\ntime point for visual signal\nreadout with the exception of HRP-TMB/H2O2,\nwhich produced significant false-positive signals and a color change\nfrom blue to brown that was difficult to interpret. Of the 4 remaining\nmethods, the metalloenzyme\u2013substrate combinations (HRP-DAB/H2O2 and ALP-BCIP/NBT) had detection limits an order\nof magnitude better than Ag deposition and polymerization-based amplification\nmethods when quantified by RGB color intensity.383 Any portable colorimetric reader, even a cell phone, could\nenable the use of these highly sensitive metalloenzyme conjugates\nin a primary healthcare setting.\n\nThe advantages of paper-based\nELISAs are potentially compromised\nby the instability of metalloenzyme conjugates, since denaturation\nof metalloenzymes leads to poor turnover of substrate and lower sensitivities.388 For this reason, notable research efforts have\nbeen devoted to optimizing long-term storage of metalloenzymes, particularly\nHRP, for use in microfluidic paper analytical devices (\u03bcPADs)\nor two-dimensional paper networks (2DPNs).385\u2212387 One method involves vacuum drying or freeze-drying enzymes and substrates\nin the presence of trehalose, a disaccharide often used as a cryoprotectant\nbecause of its capacity to stabilize the protein\u2019s interaction\nwith solvents, forming a protective \u201cglass\u201d as it dries.389,390 Ramachandran et al. used a combination of trehalose, bovine serum\nalbumin (BSA), and FeSO4-EDTA for vacuum drying of HRP-conjugated\nantibodies against malarial biomarker HRP2 into glass fiber pads.387 The stabilized HRP could be stored for 5 months\nat 45 \u00b0C under these conditions without a significant loss in\ncatalytic activity. A glass fiber pad containing all of these reagents\nwas incorporated into a 2DPN for detection of HRP2 with a LOD of 6.5\nng/mL, a value well within clinically relevant concentrations. This\nassay also demonstrated the utility of metalloenzymes in paper-based\nPOC diagnostics, providing a signal amplification step that is rarely\npresent in conventional paper diagnostics (e.g., lateral flow assays).\nThese advances in enzyme stabilization when combined with simplified\npaper-based assay formats could potentially allow for ELISA sensitivity\nto be translated for direct use at the point of care.\n\nThe integration of noble metal nanoparticles has further augmented\nthe signal amplification capabilities of metalloenzymes in infectious\ndisease diagnostics. Nanoparticles have served as surfaces for the\ncoupling of antibody-metalloenzyme conjugates and have been implemented\nin electrochemical sensors for detection of infectious disease-associated\nprotein biomarkers.391\u2212393 Zheng et al.392 developed an amperometric immunosensor for detection of HIV antigen\np24 that employed a standard \u201csandwich\u201d format. A glassy\ncarbon electrode was modified with gold nanoparticles to allow for\nimmobilization of anti-p24 capture antibodies. HRP-conjugated anti-p24\nantibodies were used for detection, catalyzing the oxidation of substrate\nhydroquinone in the presence of H2O2. The reaction\ngenerated a reductive current at the electrode surface proportional\nto p24 concentration. The detection limit of the assay was 8 pg/mL,\nsimilar to the p24 assays153,233 previously discussed\nin sections 4.1.2 and 4.2.2. While the assay was robust to\nhuman serum samples spiked with p24, the serum samples tested contained\na p24 concentration 3 orders of magnitude higher than the LOD.392 The currently required electrochemical workstation\nwould limit the assay\u2019s application to higher level laboratories.\nNonetheless, this amperometric method demonstrated the value of integrating\nnoble metal nanoparticles with metalloenzyme conjugates for signal\namplification in diagnosis of infectious diseases.\n\nNoble metal\nnanoparticles have also been utilized as colorimetric signaling probes\nin ELISAs for detection of protein biomarkers for disease.394\u2212398 So-called \u201cplasmonic\u201d ELISAs utilize the standard\n\u201csandwich\u201d assay format with an immobilized capture\nantibody and a detection antibody that is conjugated to a metalloenzyme.\nHowever, as opposed to using conventional metalloenzyme substrates\nfor colorimetric detection, plasmonic ELISAs employ the enzyme as\na kinetic tool for nanoparticle nucleation. This causes drastic shifts\nin SPR and in the absorbance spectra of the nanoparticles that are\ndetectable with the naked eye.399\n\nThe plasmonic ELISA pioneered by de la Rica and Stevens396 utilized a catalase-conjugated detection antibody\nto control the growth of AuNPs in such a manner that was proportional\nto the concentration of HIV biomarker p24. In the absence of biomarker,\nbulk Au(III) was reduced by H2O2 to form stable,\nspherical AuNPs that appeared red in color. When p24 was present in\na sample, the catalase-conjugated detection antibody was also present\nand catalyzed H2O2 disproportionation. The resulting\ndecrease in H2O2 concentration led to kinetically\nslower nucleation of AuNPs, forming aggregated AuNPs with poorly defined\nmorphology that appeared blue in color (Figure 29). The red-shift in the SPR was highly sensitive\ntoward H2O2 concentration; thus, depletion of\nH2O2 with catalase that was only present in\np24-positive samples allowed for very sensitive detection of p24 with\nthe naked eye. The absorbance was also quantified using a simple spectrophotometric\nreadout, yielding a detection limit of 1.0 ag/mL,396 nearly 6 orders of magnitude more sensitive than the previously\ndiscussed detection methods for p24 antigen.153,233,392 The authors also demonstrated\nthat the plasmonic ELISA could detect p24 in HIV-positive serum samples,\neven identifying p24 in samples from HIV-positive patients with viral\nloads less than 50 copies/mL.396 The remarkable\nsensitivity of this assay for naked-eye detection of p24 provides\nthe necessary improvement required for elimination campaigns and active\ncase management. It would permit earlier detection of p24, leading\nto improved outcomes for HIV patients. The assay could be particularly\nimpactful for the challenges associated with early infant HIV diagnosis\nin low-resource settings. The plasmonic ELISA presented by the authors\nstill calls for extensive sample handling and user manipulation and\nis currently unsuitable to a primary healthcare setting. Adaptation\nof the previously discussed enzyme stabilization measures and integration\nof the assay to a field-ready format (e.g., paper-based ELISA or 2DPN)\ncould enable its translation to an ultrasensitive field-ready diagnostic\nfor HIV detection.\n\nMetalloenzymes play a critical role for signal\namplification in\na number of assays, enabling the sensitive detection of infectious\ndiseases. Several research efforts have been aimed at translating\nthe sensitivity of metalloenzyme-based assays to formats such as paper-based\ndiagnostics that are amenable to resource-limited settings. Although\nthe issue of enzyme storage in paper has been addressed to certain\nextent,385\u2212387 the long-term stability of enzymes remains\na concern for POC diagnostics, especially in climates with elevated\ntemperatures and prevalent infectious disease. There are numerous\nmethods that utilize nonenzymatic means for signal amplification that\neliminate the issue of long-term enzyme storage altogether, including\nnanoparticles that act as enzyme mimics and other metal-based methods.\nThese will be covered in the following section.\n\nAt the heart of signal amplification\nis the principle that, for\neach biomarker target captured in an assay, many signal-generating\nelements (particles, molecules, atoms, electrons, photons, etc.) are\nproduced. In a typical nanoparticle-based assay, a single nanoparticle\noften indicates the presence of one biomolecule. However, a single\nnanoparticle is a densely packed lattice of thousands to millions\nof metal atoms, each of which, after nanoparticle dissolution or cation\nexchange, can be leveraged for signal generation (Figure 30).199,404\u2212406\n\nMetal ion chelating reagents that result in chromogenic or\nfluorescent\nsignal have long been used for detection of trace metals for a myriad\nof applications.407,408 Recently, Tong et al.405 exploited ferrous ion-chelating ferrozine in\nan iron oxide nanoparticle-linked immunosorbent assay (ILISA). Antibody-functionalized\nW\u00fcstite (FeO) particles were used as detection elements in\ndirect, competitive, indirect, and sandwich well-plate assays. After\nfunctionalized iron-oxide particles bound to the target, the nanocrystals\nwere treated with acid and reducing agents, resulting in stoichiometric\nconversion to ferrous ions. Thus, thousands of Fe2+ ions\nwere released for each biomarker present. When excess ferrozine was\nadded, solutions changed from transparent to purple upon chelation,\nwith intensities directly proportional to the iron concentration in\nsolution. Proof-of-concept assays detecting mouse IgG had low picomolar\ndetection limits, similar to assays that depend on enzymatic signal\namplification. To extend the applicability of their amplification\ntechnology, the group also demonstrated its use in a Western blot.\nBy switching the chelating reagent to potassium ferrocyanide (Prussian\nblue), the reagent could easily be precipitated onto a cellulose membrane\nwhen iron oxide particles were used as detection elements.405 While well-plate assays are far from applicable\nto field settings, the ILISA system could be translated to an aptly\ndesigned paper diagnostic format.\n\nAnother avenue for signal\namplification similar to nanoparticle\ndissolution is nanocrystal cation exchange, in which the cations within\na nanocrystal are place-exchanged with different cations.409 While bulk, solid-phase cation exchange often\nrequires elevated temperatures and several weeks, complete nanoscale\nexchange can occur within seconds due to increased surface area and\nlower energy barriers to diffusing ions.410 For cation exchange to be employed in a bioassay, nanocrystals (ZnSe,\nZnS, CdSe, or CuS) are first functionalized with target-specific molecular\nrecognition elements, such as antibodies or aptamers, which are utilized\nas detection probes. Using rapid silver ion exchange, each bound nanocrystal\nreleases thousands of Zn2+, Cd2+, or Cu2+ ions. Zinc and cadmium ions are then detectable using fluorogenic\nchelating reagents such as FluoZin-3 or Rhod-5N, respectively, and\nCu2+ can be detected in a chemiluminescent reaction with\nluminol and H2O2. These reactions produce an\namplified, stoichiometric signal and have been employed in well-plate403,411 and magnetic bead-based412\u2212415 immunoassays for protein403,411,415 and cell412 detection as well as rolling circle amplification for DNA/miRNA413,414 detection. Despite this versatility, the cation exchange method\nhas yet to be applied in paper-based formats. Similar to the ILISA\nexample discussed previously, signal amplification using nanocrystal\ncation exchange would require a precipitating reagent for metal ion\ndetection as well as clever design of a paper microfluidic device.\n\nEnzymatic signal amplification results in high analytical sensitivity\nand is easily performed in a controlled laboratory environment. However,\nas discussed in section 4.3, elevated temperatures often lead to decreased catalytic\nturnover, making it difficult to incorporate enzymatic signal amplification\ninto low-resource infectious disease diagnostics. In recent years,\nsome inorganic nanoparticles, including noble metal, rare earth, and\nmagnetic nanoparticles, have been found to display surprising enzyme-like\ncatalytic activity.416\u2212418 These nanomaterial-based artificial enzymes,\noriginally dubbed \u201cnanozymes\u201d by Manea et al.,419 are highly stable toward a range of temperatures\nand pHs and cannot be degraded by proteases. Further, catalytic activity\nof inorganic nanoparticles can be tuned with particle size, shape,\ncoating, modification, and composition. For these reasons, nanozymes\nhave been incorporated into a myriad of sensors for various applications.\n\nIn 2007, Gao et al.420 made the surprising\ndiscovery that magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles\nhave intrinsic peroxidase-like activity, displaying Michaelis\u2013Menten\nkinetics consistent with a ping-pong mechanism. Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles were found to catalytically turn over\nseveral common horseradish peroxidase substrates, including TMB, DAB,\nand o-phenylenediamine (OPD), with catalytic turnover\nnumbers equal to or improved over horseradish peroxidase. The group\ndemonstrated that the particles could be used in place of horseradish\nperoxidase in a traditional immunoassay and that the magnetic properties\nof Fe3O4 could be leveraged further to enrich\nbiomarkers before detection.420 As a result\nof this seminal work, magnetic nanoparticles have been employed as\nsignal amplification elements in protein and DNA bioassays for a variety\nof infectious diseases, including Ebola,242 rotavirus,402Mycoplasma\npneumonia,421Vibrio cholerae,422Chlamydia trachomatis,401L. monocytogenes,423Enterobacter sakazakii,424 and Salmonella typhimurium.425\n\nBeyond magnetite, several other\ntypes of nanoparticles, including\ngold,426 platinum,427 hybrid particles,428\u2212432 and MOFs,433 have been utilized as enzyme\nmimics in bioassays for targets such as respiratory syncytial virus,432 avian influenza A,426Salmonella, and E.\ncoli,431 hepatitis C and\nHIV,428 and Staphylococcus\naureus.433 Many of the\nassays that utilize nanozymes as catalytic turnover reagents for detection\nare formatted similarly to immunoassays on the surface of well plates.402,421\u2212423 Several groups have translated this technology\nto the lateral flow format and found that the nanozyme detection element\nresulted in at least 100-fold improvement in limits of detection when\ncompared to traditional gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow strips.242,424,427,431,434 For example, Loynachan et al.435 developed an ultrasensitive lateral flow assay\nfor the detection of HIV p24 antigen using porous platinum Au@Pt core\u2013shell\nnanozymes that catalyzed the precipitation of CN/DAB (4-chloro-1-naphthol/3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine\ntetrahydrochloride) in the presence of H2O2 (Figure 31). Incorporation\nof this detection scheme, as well as careful and systematic design\nof the affinity reagents for p24 capture and detection, resulted in\na lateral flow assay with femtomolar detection limits, more sensitive\nthan laboratory-based ELISA methods and nearly 2 orders of magnitude\nmore sensitive than commercially available rapid tests.435 Because visual signal varied linearly with\nconcentration before and after catalytic signal amplification, the\ntest also had an ultrabroad dynamic range. The advantages of the nanoparticle\nenzyme mimics were directly demonstrated in a stability test in which\nthe activities of lyophilized porous Pt core\u2013shell nanocatalyst\nconjugate and lyophilized HRP conjugates were measured over time.\nWhile the enzyme conjugates lost nearly all activity after 15 days\nof storage at room temperature, the nanocatalysts maintained 100%\nof their initial activity while stored at room temperature and nearly\n80% of their initial activity while stored at 44 \u00b0C for up to\n42 days.435 However, it should be noted\nthat the optimal HRP lyophilization and storage conditions387,389 discussed in section 4.3.1 were not employed in this study.\n\nTo achieve such significant improvements\nin sensitivity using nanozymes,\na wash step, a substrate addition step, and a reaction quenching step\nwere inserted into the lateral flow assay workflow after the initial\nsignal development.435 These additional\nsteps make this assay and other similar diagnostics more difficult\nto perform in the field. Redesigned paper devices or automated lateral\nflow cassettes could simplify this workflow and allow for application\nof nanozymes in field settings, providing much-needed signal amplification\nand improved sensitivity for low-resource infectious disease diagnostics.\n\nThe\nuse of gold nanoparticles as detection elements in commercially\navailable lateral flow assays is ubiquitous.436 Particles used in these assays are typically 15\u201350 nm and\ncan be detected either visually (without optical equipment) or using\nsimple hand-held readers.177,219,437 Often, the detection limits of these assays are not low enough to\ndiagnose low-density infections. One simple solution for improving\nsensitivity is chemically enlarging the particles, making them more\nvisually intense. In this process, a lateral flow assay is run in\nthe typical manner such that, if the antigen is present, a gold nanoparticle-containing\nsandwich complex is formed at the test line. Next, an enhancement\nsolution consisting of a molecular precursor and reducing agent is\nadded to the test. The gold nanoparticles at the test and control\nlines serve as nucleation sites for solid metal deposition. The most\ncommon format for particle enlargement, silver enhancement, is based\non 19th-century photographic techniques and involves the reduction\nof silver ions (e.g., silver nitrate) to silver metal on the surface\nof gold particles in an acidic buffered solution containing hydroquinone.438 This process is similar to the seeded-growth\nnanoparticle synthesis method and can result in particles from hundreds\nof nanometers to several micrometers in diameter (Figure 32).439\n\nBecause silver enhancement\nfound its first biological application\nin tissue staining in 1935,440 there are\nmany commercially available silver enhancement solutions designated\nfor microscopy applications (Sigma, Thermo, Ted Pella, Nano, etc.).\nThe first application of silver enhancement to paper diagnostics was\nin 1991 when Horton et al.441 developed\na proof-of-concept lateral flow assay for the detection of mouse IgG\nand demonstrated that silver treatment resulted in a 100-fold improvement\nin detection limits. Since then, silver enhancement has successfully\nimproved the detection of many infectious diseases by several orders\nof magnitude, including influenza,439,442 HIV,443 malaria,444\u2212449Y. pestis,450 and E. coli.451\n\nOne of the drawbacks to silver enhancement on lateral\nflow assays\nis that it must be performed after the test has completed its initial\ndevelopment. Increasing the total number of steps required reduces\nthe likelihood that the test could be applied in the field. For example,\none group450 found that silver enhancement\nimproved the detection limits of their Y. pestis test 1000-fold. In order to take advantage of this impressive enhancement,\nthe authors allowed the gold test to develop as usual, washed the\nstrip three times, submerged it into enhancing reagents for 5 min,\nand then stopped the reaction with sodium thiosulfate. This procedure\nis feasible in a district hospital or even a local health outpost\nwith minimal resources, and the enhanced assay would be a true asset\nin these settings should a plague pandemic occur. However, the additional\nsteps required for signal amplification make POC application in a\nlow-resource field setting unlikely.\n\nFor this reason, some groups\nwho employ a silver enhancement step\nin their paper diagnostic assays have moved away from the traditional\nlateral flow assay format and toward alternative formats that allow\nfor automated delivery of silver enhancement reagents to the test\nline. Fujifilm439,452 applied their expertise in photo\ntechnology to develop a benchtop workstation that automated silver\nenhancement for influenza rapid diagnostic tests. In this format,\na user added the sample to a lateral flow cartridge that contained\nall reagents necessary for test washing and silver enhancement. The\ncartridge was inserted into the benchtop workstation, which released\nthe solutions in a timed, automated manner and provided a quantitative\nreadout of the strip after test development was completed. Despite\nthe fact that the instrument greatly simplified the assay protocol\nfor the user, the requirement of a reliable source of electricity\ngreatly inhibits its application to a field setting.\n\nRecently,\nthe Yager and Fu groups have designed 2DPNs that rely\non unique paper geometry or embedded paper-fluidic valves to enable\nprogrammed, electricity-free delivery of silver enhancement reagents\nto the assay test line.444\u2212448,453,454 These 2DPNs simply require the addition of sample and buffer to\npads that have been preloaded with assay reagents, mirroring the same\nnumber of steps required to run a traditional lateral flow assay.\nThe unique physical structures of 2DPNs allow for precisely timed\ndelivery of sample, then gold conjugate, and finally silver enhancement\nreagents to the test line. Similarly, Cho et al.455 developed a cross-flow chromatography system, in which\nsilver enhancement reagents were embedded into paper and then rehydrated\nafter the lateral flow assay developed. The enhancement reagents flowed\nperpendicular to the initial immunochromatographic test over the test\nand control lines. These creative approaches to redesigning the lateral\nflow assay make silver enhancement the most field-deployable metal-based\nsignal amplification strategy to date, although large-scale manufacturing\nrequirements must be considered to determine the scalability of such\ntest designs.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that while silver\nenhancement on gold\nparticles is most common, other metals have been used for reductive\nnanoparticle enlargement for lateral flow enhancement. Gold has been\ndeposited onto gold and silver nanoparticles,443,456\u2212458 and silver onto silver and platinum nanoparticles.459 While there are many other examples of solution\nand microfluidic assays employing reductive nanoparticle enlargement\nfor visual and electrochemical signal amplification, these formats\nare less conducive to low-resource disease diagnosis.451,457,460\n\nThe amplification\nmethods discussed thus far increase the number of signaling elements\nafter the initial assay has developed, requiring additional steps\npost hoc. Another amplification strategy is to generate a greater\nnumber of detectable molecules midassay, thereby increasing the downstream\nsignal output of the assay. In 2002, the Mirkin group461 demonstrated that protein biomarker targets\ncould be detected indirectly in a highly sensitive manner by employing\ngold nanoparticles functionalized with DNA tags. In this strategy,\nmagnetic microparticles functionalized with target-specific antibodies\nwere added to a biological sample. After biomarker capture, the supernatant\nwas removed and intermediate detection elements were added to the\nparticles. These detection elements consisted of gold nanoparticles\nfunctionalized with a low density of target-specific antibodies and\na very high density of double-stranded barcode DNA. Using an external\nmagnet, the gold nanoparticles that bound the target were separated,\nand then the barcode DNA was dehybridized and detected downstream\n(Figure 33).462 Because the number of barcode tags was much\nhigher than the number of captured biomarkers, the resulting signal\nwas amplified when compared to a direct detection method. One powerful\nadvantage of this modular assay format is it could be easily multiplexed,\nwith distinct barcode tags for each target of interest.463 Further, while the biobarcode method was initially\napplied to the detection of proteins, it has also been applied to\nnucleic acid detection. Simply replacing the biomarker-specific antibodies\nwith DNA complementary to the nucleic acid target allows for detection\nof DNA or RNA targets with PCR-like sensitivity.464\n\nSince its development,\nthe biobarcode assay format has been utilized\nfor the detection of infectious diseases such as hepatitis B,463 hepatitis C,465,466 variola virus,463 Ebola,463 HIV,463,467,468B. anthracis,464 and Salmonella,469 as well as C-reactive protein470 and a variety of cytokines.471,472 Despite its promise for sensitive detection, the biobarcode assay\nformat suffers from two major drawbacks: (1) the high number of user\nsteps required before the barcode tags are released for detection\nmakes it extremely difficult to adapt to a low-resource format, and\n(2) low-resource detection of the nucleic acid tags remains a challenge.\nInitial detection strategies for the biobarcode assay were scanometric;\nthe barcode tags were detected in a sandwich hybridization assay on\nthe surface of a glass slide, with gold nanoparticles as the detection\nelements. Signal was further enhanced using reductive silver deposition\nbefore the slides were evaluated using image analysis.461\u2212464,467,473 Methods such as PCR,466,468 mass spectrometry,474 and electrical detection465 have been employed to detect the barcode tags as well.\nNam et al.461,472 developed a colorimetric assay\nin which the released gold nanoparticle biobarcode tags were introduced\nto a second solution of gold nanoparticles functionalized with single-stranded\nDNA complementary to the tags. The hybridization of the biobarcode\ntags with complementary DNA resulted in aggregation of the two gold\nnanoparticle-DNA conjugates, yielding a detectable color change. None\nof these detection methods can be employed in a field setting; however,\nit is not difficult to imagine developing a hybridization-based lateral\nflow assay for barcode tag detection or functionalizing the tags themselves\nwith moieties such as biotin or a FLAG peptide that could make them\nreadily detectable in a paper diagnostic format.\n\nAs is evidenced\nby sections 4.3 and 4.4, significant advances\nhave been made in developing metalloenzyme- and metal nanoparticle-based\nsignal amplification strategies for infectious disease diagnosis.\nHowever, even with the advancements in metalloenzyme stabilization\nand highly stable nanoparticle-based approaches, POC assays utilizing\nsignal amplification are still scarce. Most of the assays discussed,\neven those that employ paper substrates or lateral flow formats, require\ntoo many user steps before the signal is generated. Future work that\nminimizes user steps, for instance, through use of 2DPNs or vertical\nflow assay formats, will be critical in translating these signal amplification\nstrategies from laboratory tests to assays that can be run at a primary\nhealthcare facility. Moreover, most of the assays discussed in sections 4.3 and 4.4 were also heavily reliant on benchtop, laboratory-based\ninstrumentation for signal readout. The next section will discuss\nthe various types of field-deployable instrumentation that have been\ndeveloped in an effort to bring quantitative and sensitive assays,\nsuch as those discussed in section 4, to low-resource settings.\n\nConventional microscopy\nremains the gold standard diagnostic technique for many infectious\ndiseases, including malaria, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, and intestinal\nprotozoa.475 To detect these diseases,\na variety of microscopic techniques, such as bright field, dark field,\nand fluorescence microscopy, are used for direct inspection of stained\nor unstained smears (blood, sputum, urine, etc.). While microscopy\ncan be a useful diagnostic tool, results depend strongly on infection\nintensities, sample preparation methods, and the training level of\nthe microscopist.476 These challenges lead\nto variability that reduces the utility of microscopy-based diagnosis\nin field settings, especially in low-transmission areas. Additionally,\nmicroscope instrumentation can be expensive and bulky. To address\nthese drawbacks, many groups are developing portable, affordable,\nand easy-to-use microscopy tools suitable for low-resource settings.\n\nOne approach to bringing laboratory-based microscopy tools to low-resource\nsettings involves building simple, portable, and/or miniature microscopes\nfrom low-cost materials. While this solution does not address some\nof the primary disadvantages of microscopy as a POC diagnostic (i.e.,\nthe need for skilled microscopists and sample preparation requirements),\nit does allow for conventional microscope platforms to be deployed\nin difficult settings at low cost. Such devices typically replace\nhigh-energy, expensive light sources with LEDs, reducing the expense\nand power required for illumination in addition to increasing the\nlight source lifetime.477 Structural components\nof these microscopes are often three-dimensionally (3D) printed,477\u2212480 and affordable plastic or hybrid lenses and fiber optics can replace\nexpensive and delicate glass lenses.477\u2212479,481\u2212484 For example, Miller et al.480,485 developed a portable,\nlow-cost ($240 USD), LED-based fluorescent microscope (Global Focus\nmicroscope) weighing just 1 kg and powered by two AA batteries (Figure 34A). The diagnostic\nutility of the microscope was demonstrated in a small field trial\nfor detection of M. tuberculosis. When\nsamples were evaluated as positive or negative for M. tuberculosis, results from the Global Focus microscope\nand a laboratory-grade fluorescence microscope were in agreement for\n98.4% of cases.485 Many similarly portable\nand lightweight microscopes have been developed, including tomographic,482 holographic,483 wide-field,484 and fluorescence486 microscopes, some impressively weighing in at less than 200 g.479,482\u2212484 These microscopes have been applied not\nonly to the detection of tuberculosis480,485,486 but also to malaria,481 soil-transmitted helminths,487 schistosomiasis,487 and Hymenolepis nana.482\n\nThe Foldscope is an example of a low-resource microscope\nthat most\nembodies the ASSURED criteria.488 Assembled\nusing the principles of origami, the Foldscope is constructed from\nflat paper, copper tape, a button-cell battery, an LED, polymer filters,\nand a ball lens (Figure 34B). The entire device costs less than $1, can achieve magnification\nup to 2180\u00d7, and was shown to be capable of detecting Giardia lamblia, Leishmania donovani, Trypanosoma cruzi, E. coli, and Schistosoma hematobium eggs.488 Despite these accomplishments,\nwhen the Foldscope was applied to S. hematobium detection in a field setting, the diagnostic sensitivity was just\n55.9% when compared to conventional light microscopy.489 This limited sensitivity was likely a result\nof challenges with physical manipulation of the Foldscope when integrated\nwith a smartphone display. In other words, the Foldscope failed to\nsatisfy the \u201cU\u201d for user-friendly in the ASSURED criteria\nfor this particular use-case. This example demonstrates the importance\nof rigorous field evaluation of novel diagnostic devices and indicates\nthat improvements to the Foldscope must be made before implementation\nfor case management.\n\nRecently, mobile phone-based microscopy\nhas emerged as a potential\nalternative to conventional microscopes for infectious disease diagnostics.\nPhone-based bright-field, fluorescence, and dark-field microscopy\ndevices have been developed, often employing compact, pocket-sized\nattachments (Figure 34C).490 These devices have been applied\nto the detection of a myriad of infectious diseases, including malaria,491,492 tuberculosis,492 schistosomiasis,493,494 human papillomavirus (HPV),495 soil-transmitted\nhelminths,496 filarial diseases,497,498 and intestinal protozoa.494,499 Repurposing mobile\nphones is advantageous due to their widespread adoption and growing\nconnectivity in low-resource settings. Additionally, the acquisition\nof digital images could allow for image-processing (locally or remotely),\nautomated diagnoses, and near real-time data transmission. These advantages,\ncoupled with disease-specific software applications, could potentially\ndecrease the user variability typically associated with microscopy,\nimproving case management and epidemiological studies.\n\nOne example\nthat leverages these advantages is the LoaScope, developed\nby the Fletcher group (Figure 34D).500,497,498 The LoaScope is a smartphone-based device that combines video microscopy\nand automated software with onboard quantitative detection based on\nthe movements of filarial parasite Loa loa in whole blood. An application downloaded to the smartphone is used\nfor stage control, video capture, image analysis, and data reporting\nof quantitative L. loa microfilaria\ndensities. Detection of L. loa is important\nbecause high levels of microfilariae are associated with potentially\nfatal adverse events after treatment with ivermectin, a drug frequently\nused in mass drug administration efforts against onchocerciasis and\nlymphatic filariasis (LF). These adverse events have led to the suspension\nof mass drug administration campaigns and subsequent major setbacks\nin onchocerciasis and LF elimination efforts. Rapid, point-of-care\nmeasurement of L. loa infection intensity\ncould allow for these elimination campaigns to resume.\n\nThis\ndevice was validated in a field setting and yielded results\nsimilar to those of thick smears.497 It\nwas then applied in a large-scale (16,259 participants) test-and-not-treat\napproach for onchocerciasis in an area with high prevalence that had\nnot participated in mass drug administration campaigns since 1999\ndue to the prevalence of L. loa.498 Each patient was screened for L. loa burden using the LoaScope, and those with\nhigh counts were not given ivermectin but were treated for L. loa with albendazole. This is a striking example\nof mobile phone-based microscopy in the field; all LoaScope measurements\nwere performed by operators with only one hour of training, and the\napplication-specific software significantly decreased the probability\nof user error by eliminating the need for subjective interpretation\nof results. In total, the LoaScope enabled ivermectin delivery to\n15522 participants that otherwise would not have received treatment\nfor onchocerciasis, demonstrating the incredible impact mobile phone\nmicroscopy can have when applied to detection of infectious diseases.498\n\nDespite the fact that many mobile phone-based\nmicroscopes lack\nthe analytical and diagnostic sensitivity of conventional microscopes,\nthe LoaScope is an excellent demonstration that mobile phone microscopy\ncan be highly impactful if applied in an appropriate use-case scenario.\nBecause this particular study focused on identifying patients with\nvery high L. loa burdens, it is unclear\nto what extent this device could detect low-burden infections. Generalization\nof this technology to other filarial diseases will also require further\nstudy. Additionally, potential interference from other filarial parasites\nneeds to be studied. As work continues in the field of low-resource\nmicroscopy, it will be important to develop new tools with specific\nuse-case scenarios in mind. One potential avenue for application-based\ninnovation involves development of low-resource sample preparation\nmethods coupled with novel probes, such as the inorganic complexes\nand nanoparticles discussed in section 4.\n\nWhile much\nprogress has been made in the development of rugged, field-applicable\nmicroscopy devices, lateral flow assays currently remain the most\nfield-friendly format for infectious disease diagnosis. However, the\nsimple, direct visual readout of lateral flow assays, often cited\nas one of the primary advantages of this format, is also considered\nits Achilles heel; difficulties in interpretation resulting from visual\nimpairment and operator bias can result in user-to-user variation.\nAfter tests are interpreted, maintaining accurate records and communicating\ntest results to local and national health organizations remain substantial\nchallenges. To overcome these challenges, a number of optical readers\nhave been developed and commercialized to provide rapid, objective,\nand quantitative measurements of signal on lateral flow assays. The\nunderlying instrumentation within these readers can generally be grouped\ninto two categories: (1) optomechanical scanning and (2) imaging.\n\nFor scanning readers, the primary optical components include a light\nsource (LED or laser) and photodiode.501 The specifications of these components are tailored to the specific\ndetection element used in a particular assay. Light source power and\nwavelength are determined by the absorbance or excitation wavelength\nof the labels employed in each specific test. The light source is\nrastered along the lateral flow strip, and a photodiode then detects\nreflectance or emission, depending on whether colorimetric or fluorescent\nlabels are used. Measurements are typically recorded with millivolt\n(mV) units, though biomarker concentration can be obtained if a calibration\ncurve is established. When colored particles are present at the control\nand test lines, they absorb incident light, resulting in a quantifiable\ndecrease in reflectance. For fluorescent labels, the intensity of\nemitted light increases as the light source passes over the control\nand test lines.\n\nOptics are configured in either a specular or\nconfocal arrangement.501 In the specular\narrangement, which is primarily\nused for colorimetric labels, the photodiode is positioned such that\nit collects light that is reflected from the test at the same angle\nas the incident light from the source. Confocal scanning systems can\nbe used to measure reflectance or fluorescence. In this case, incident\nlight is focused to a point on the lateral flow strip, and the photodiode\nis placed above this focal point. Light returning from the strip,\nwhether reflected or emitted, passes through an aperture that excludes\nrays that were not directly from the focal point, eliminating background\nscattering.502 In the case of fluorescent\nlabels, a dichroic mirror or filter is often placed before the aperture.\nBoth specular and confocal scanning configurations are sensitive to\nthe z position of the lateral flow strip. In the\nspecular arrangement, any small deviation along the z axis can result in the reflected light completely missing the photodiode\ndue to misalignment. Confocal systems are slightly more tolerant to\nsmall variations along the z axis, depending on the\nsize of the pinhole aperture. However, even slight variations off\nthe focal plane can drastically decrease the number of photons reaching\nthe photodiode, altering the quantitative output. Another challenge\nassociated with confocal and some specular opto-mechanical scanning\nstrip readers is that a point of incident light only covers 10\u201320%\nof the test and control lines.503 This\nis especially problematic if the concentration of particles varies\nalong the test or control line due to improper flow or manufacturing\nvariations.\n\nDespite these challenges, scanning systems are advantageous\ndue\nto their low cost and relative simplicity. One of the most widely\nused commercial systems is the ESEQuant line of lateral flow readers\nmanufactured by Qiagen, Inc. (Figure 35A).346 Qiagen offers customization\nof optics for colorimetric, fluorescent, chemiluminescent, and upconverting\nphosphor labels. The user should take into account that these systems\noften vary in sensitivity. As a general rule, smaller portable systems\nrarely perform as well as their benchtop counterparts. For example,\nvan Dam et al.313 found that the portable\ncommercial reader, the UCP-Quant (Qiagen), was at least an order of\nmagnitude less sensitive than a custom-modified benchtop reader for\nevaluating upconverting phosphor-based schistosomiasis lateral flow\nassays. Consequently, selecting a scanning lateral flow strip reader\nfor a particular application requires consideration of both portability\nand sensitivity.\n\nImaging-based lateral flow readers greatly reduce the optical\nequipment\nrequired for quantifying lateral flow assays. These systems produce\na picture record of a lateral flow assay using a charge coupled device\n(CCD) or complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) detector and\nrely on image processing software to detect and/or quantify the intensity\nof the test line.503 Benefits of this format\ninclude the ability to store test images alongside patient records\nand a lack of moving parts, making imaging-based readers more robust\nto field conditions. Further, image analysis software can identify\nand correct for nonuniform signal, allowing for analysis of the full\ntest line. Imaging-based readers can be used for detection of colorimetric\nand fluorescent labels. In the latter case, hardware for excitation\nis required, and filters can be added to improve image quality. Since\ntest position and illumination can affect image analysis, many camera-based\nlateral flow readers include housing units for run-to-run consistency.\nCommercial lateral flow imaging devices include the Deki Reader (Fio),\nAX-2X (Axxin Inc.), SkanSmart (Skannex), and the RDS-2500 PRO (Detekt\nBiomedical LLC) (Figure 35B).504\u2212506 These devices have been used for quantification\nof malaria,507\u2212510 dengue,509Burkholderia\npseudomallei,509 and Y. pestis(509) lateral flow\nassays, and some, such as the Deki Reader, have been tested extensively\nin the field.507\u2212510\n\nImage-based lateral flow quantification translates well to\nmobile\nphone technology, especially as smartphone camera quality improves.\nMobile phones have been used to quantify lateral flow assays for numerous\ndiseases, including malaria,511\u2212514 HIV,511 and tuberculosis.511 Similar to commercially available imaging-based\nreaders, many of these studies required external devices to ensure\nconsistent illumination and distance from the camera in order to maintain\nconsistent image analysis. Recently, Scherr et al. developed a lateral\nflow imaging platform using an unmodified mobile phone as the only\nhardware.512 Relying only on software for\nimage analysis, lateral flow images were captured under ambient lighting\nconditions. The images were sent to a secure web database (REDCap)\nand analyzed using a MATLAB-based algorithm. Quantitative results\nwere sent back to REDCap and delivered to the phone in real time.\nThis software-based imaging platform was tolerant to moderate variations\nin test orientation, distance, and illumination, making data collection\nas easy as taking a cell phone picture. When compared to the scanning\nESEQuant lateral flow reader, this processing platform was found to\nhave improved detection limits. Additionally, the algorithm reliably\nworked for camera resolutions between 0.5 and 8 megapixels, suggesting\nthat any modern mobile phone camera could capture images with sufficient\nquality for the image processing software to work.512\n\nAs mobile phones are incorporated into low-resource\ndiagnostic\nworkflows, it is important to ask whether the conventional lateral\nflow format can be redesigned to take full advantage of potential\nbenefits smartphones can offer. In other words, what changes can be\nmade to the diagnostic test format that maintain the simplicity of\nlateral flow assays but will enable improved quantification, communication,\nand aggregation of test results? One option is to embed quick response\n(QR) codes into the lateral flow test. This idea has been approached\nin a number of ways, including placing stickers on lateral flow tests\nand adding a transparent overlay in which the test and control lines\nbecome part of the QR code.514,515 In these formats,\nthe embedded barcode is either static, providing useful information\nabout the brand, lot, and patient ID, or dynamic, producing a positive/negative\nread-out. Scherr et al. developed a novel platform in which the control\nline of the lateral flow assay was replaced with a control grid patterned\nin the shape of a QR code (Figure 35C).513 The QR code functioned\nas a flow control, appearing on both positive and negative tests,\nbut not invalid tests. The QR codes also triggered data analysis and\nenabled corrections for lighting effects. When scanned, manufacturing\ndetails were quickly and easily accessed at the same time as the test\nline was quantified.513 It is not difficult\nto imagine the impact such a test format could have when combined\nwith the data communication and aggregation abilities of smartphones.\nEpidemiological and surveillance studies could account for variables\nthat are not even currently considered in most studies, such as manufacturing\nbatch-to-batch variation. Geographic data could also be coupled to\nspecific rapid tests.\n\nAs tools for automated reading of lateral\nflow assays become more\nprevalent, establishing standards for consistent reporting and data\nmanagement will be important. Just like with the lateral flow assays\nthemselves, test-reading instrumentation will need to be validated\nto ensure proper and consistent biomarker quantification across different\ndevices and test brands. Although optical lateral flow readers may\ndetect test lines invisible to the human eye, readers alone will not\nreplace the need for ultrasensitive lateral flow tests.\n\nMobile\nphones have been adapted for optical measurements beyond\nlateral flow quantification. One example is the mobile phone-based,\nhand-held microplate reader developed by Berg et al.382 This device consists of a 3D-printed attachment in which\nan LED array illuminates each well, and the transmitted light is collected\nvia 96 individual optical fibers. Results are visualized and delivered\nto the user in one minute within a custom mobile phone app. The device\nwas shown to be more than 98% accurate for immunoassays detecting\nmumps IgG, measles IgG, and herpes simplex virus IgG (HSV-1 and HSV-2)\nwhen compared to an FDA-approved clinical spectrophotometer.382 While microplate-based immunoassays are not\nfeasible in a field setting, this device could make a true impact\nin resource-limited clinics as an excellent alternative to traditional\nbulky and expensive spectrophotometers. Additionally, because the\ndevice is attached to a mobile phone, it offers the potential to rapidly\ncommunicate and aggregate results, further enabling large-scale epidemiological\nstudies.\n\nMobile phone attachments for other optical detection\nmodalities have been developed as well. In one exciting example, Long\net al.516 developed the TRI-Analyzer, a\ntrimodal smartphone attachment capable of measuring transmission,\nreflection, and emission intensities. This multifunctional device\nleveraged white light from the smartphone\u2019s rear-facing flash\nLED or an integrated green laser diode for sample illumination via\noptical fibers. The optical fibers collected light transmitted through\nor emitted from the sample or light reflected from a photonic crystal\nbiosensor. This collected light was then collimated and focused before\nbeing dispersed by the diffraction grating onto the smartphone CMOS\nsensor. The intensity at each wavelength was determined by the integration\nof pixel intensity at the corresponding position along the sensor.\nThis clever detection strategy allowed for full absorbance and emission\nspectra to be collected with a simple smartphone-based device. In\ntwo proof-of-concept assays, the developed device could detect analytes\nat lower concentrations than those detected using conventional laboratory\ninstrumentation, indicating that the miniaturization of the technology\ndid not result in a trade-off of sensitivity.516 Thus, this trimodal smartphone attachment enables quantitative\nlaboratory-quality optical measurements at one\u2019s fingertips.\nSimilarly formatted mobile phone-based spectrophotometers,517,518 surface plasmon resonance sensors,519\u2212521 and flow cytometers522,523 have also been developed. The miniaturization and decrease in cost\nassociated with these smartphone-enabled tools will make laboratory\ntechniques possible that would otherwise be inaccessible in low-resource\nsettings.\n\nNoble metal nanoparticles\nhave extremely high molar absorptivities, making them ideal visual\nlabels for lateral flow assays. This intense absorbance occurs when\nparticles are excited with light that matches the resonant oscillation\nof their free electrons. As these electrons relax down to the ground\nstate, they release energy in the form of heat to the surroundings.524 The amount of heat generated is equal to the\nproduct of the number of noble metal nanoparticles, the cross-sectional\narea of the nanoparticles, and the intensity of the incident light.524 Recently, Bischof\u2019s group took advantage\nof these unique thermophysical properties to develop a novel method\nfor lateral flow quantification based on the thermal contrast of gold\nnanoparticles.524\u2212526 In this method, a high-powered green laser\nwas used to excite the gold nanoparticles, and an infrared-detecting\ncamera was employed to measure the resulting thermal contrast. An\nearly benchtop prototype of the device demonstrated a 32-fold improvement\nin detection limits of an FDA approved lateral flow assay for cryptococcal\ncapsular polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan antigen (CrAg).525 CrAg is a biomarker for cryptococcal infections,\nwhich are opportunistic fungal infections that are among the leading\ncauses of death for patients with AIDS and a common cause of adult\nmeningitis in sub-Saharan Africa.525 The\nthermal contrast-coupled CrAg lateral flow assay was further validated\nin a second study, displaying 92% accuracy in quantifying CrAg levels\nin patient samples.527\n\nAfter successful\nvalidation of their prototype device, the group developed a reader\nthat incorporated a green laser, infrared camera, and automated control\nsystem into a benchtop box device (Figure 36).526 The study\ndemonstrated the utility and versatility of thermal contrast as a\nmethod for quantification of lateral flow assays from a variety of\nvendors and for multiple diseases. An 8-fold improvement in detection\nthreshold compared to visual inspection was found for lateral flow\nassays for influenza (BD Veritor), malaria (First Response, SD BIOLINE,\nand ParaHIT), and Clostridium difficile (RIDAQUICK).526 In a separate study,\nthe group found that this enhancement factor was greater as nanoparticle\nsize increased, suggesting that redesign of lateral flow assays could\nfurther improve test sensitivity using a thermal contrast reader.528\n\nWhile thermal contrast\nrepresents a unique and versatile method\nfor lateral flow quantification, several issues must be addressed\nbefore large-scale implementation. These include cost, portability,\nand background signal reduction from biological interferences such\nas blood. Additionally, nitrocellulose membranes are highly flammable;\nwhile it does not appear that full strip ignition has occurred in\nthe currently published studies, visible burn marks along the nitrocellulose\nmembrane526 suggest that safety studies\nto determine the limits of the thermal contrast system should be undertaken\nbefore widespread implementation. Nevertheless, thermal contrast represents\na highly sensitive and promising tool for lateral flow quantification.\n\nSurface-enhanced\nRaman spectroscopy (SERS) is a highly sensitive\nvibrational spectroscopy technique for structure-based analyte detection.\nIn this technique, excited localized surface plasmons, typically from\nnoble metal (e.g., gold and silver) substrates with nanoscale features,\ngenerate amplified electromagnetic fields, enhancing the inelastic\nRaman scattering signals of analytes of interest up to 1014 times.529 Instrumentation for SERS detection\nrequires a high-powered laser excitation source, which is typically\ntuned according to the resonant frequency of the plasmonic substrate.\nAfter excitation, filters are used to exclude elastic Rayleigh scattering,\nallowing only Raman-scattered light to reach the detector.530\n\nThe high sensitivity of SERS makes it\nan attractive detection platform for infectious disease diagnostics,\nparticularly for the detection of low-density infections. Many laboratory-based\nbioassays for protein, nucleic acid, and whole-cell biomarkers that\nleverage SERS detection have been developed for a myriad of infectious\ndiseases.68,531\u2212536 These assays are generally either performed on the surface of particles\nin solution or on a bulk solid substrate. Detection elements typically\nconsist of nanoparticles functionalized with Raman reporter molecules\nand target-specific molecular recognition elements.529 Once a complex is formed, the nanoparticles provide the\nplasmonic surface for Raman signal enhancement of the reporter molecule.\nNanoparticles are typically gold, silver, or Au@Ag particles and come\nin a variety of shapes that provide optimized signal enhancement.537 Small-molecule Raman reporters, such as 4-mercaptobenzoic\nacid, malachite green, and 4-aminothiophenol, are often employed because\nbiomolecule targets typically have complex vibrational signatures\nand are frequently too far away from the plasmonic surface for sensitive\ndetection and identification.529\n\nThe bulky nature and resource requirements of SERS detection remain\nits primary barrier to implementation in point-of-care settings. Several\nhand-held Raman spectrometers have been developed and commercialized,\nincluding the FirstDefender (ThermoFisher Scientific, Inc.),538,539 NanoRam (B&W Tek),540,541 and Progeny (Rigaku\nCorp.). These devices are advertised for identification of unknown\nsubstances in forensic, environmental, military, and first-response\ncontexts and for quality control in industrial settings. While many\nstudies that utilize SERS-based detection for infectious disease biomarkers\nsuggest that these commercially available portable devices could be\nutilized for analysis of a SERS-based lateral flow assay, none of\nthe studies have actually implemented a hand-held device.542\u2212547 Accordingly, it is unknown whether such devices have sufficient\nsensitivity or spatial resolution to use effectively with low-resource\ndiagnostics. These parameters, along with cost analysis, should be\nstudied to determine whether current commercial devices could be implemented.\n\nMagnetic nanoparticles\npossess advantages over optical lateral flow labels because their\nsignal is rarely hindered by test opacity or biological interferents.\nA detailed discussion of these qualities as well as examples of specific\nassays that employ magnetic nanoparticles are provided in section 4.2.6. Here,\nwe discuss instrumentation required for magnetic particle detection.\n\nThere are a variety of methods\nfor detecting paramagnetic and superparamagnetic\nnanoparticles on lateral flow assays based on either the inductive\neffect or magnetoresistance. For example, MagnaBioSciences (USA) has\ndeveloped an induction-based device that has been used extensively\nin the literature for detection of infectious diseases such as anthrax,366,367T. solium,349 HIV,360,361V. parahemolyticus,364 and L. monocytogenes.365 In this format, the lateral flow\nassay is placed inside an oscillating magnetic field on a set of induction\ncoils, and the instrument measures the induced electromotive force\n(V) on the coils. Assays quantified by this technology generally had\na greater sensitivity compared to visual detection of iron oxide particles.548 While the current iteration of the MagnaBioSciences\nreader is a relatively large benchtop device that is unsuitable for\nuse in low-resource settings, a more portable version is being developed.549,550 Other companies, such as Magnasense (Finland) and Magnisense (France),\nhave developed portable, hand-held devices based on inductive detection\nof paramagnetic particles, though these devices have not been as extensively\ntested in the literature.\n\nSeveral groups have developed lateral\nflow assay readers using\nmagnetoresistive sensors. These devices are based on the principle\nthat the electrical resistance of certain materials, which are incorporated\nin the sensors, can change upon application of an external magnetic\nfield.350 There are several types of sensors\nbased on magnetoresistance, but the most common are giant magnetoresistive\n(GMR) sensors, which were once used in the reading heads for hard\ndisk drives.551 When applied to lateral\nflow assays, GMR sensors are placed in close proximity to the test\nand control lines, and an external magnetic field is applied to the\ntest. This external field aligns the magnetic moments of paramagnetic\nor superparamagnetic lateral flow detection reporters. This alignment\nthen produces a fringe field that is detectable by a change in resistance\nwhen a constant current is applied across the GMR sensor.551 Magnetoresistive sensors have been applied\nextensively by researchers to the detection of magnetic particle labels\non lateral flow assays; however, most have been proof-of-principle\nstudies using imitative lateral flow assays or tests for biomarkers\nsuch as hCG, cardiac troponin 1, and IFN-\u03b3.357,552\u2212555\n\nThe high sensitivity of magnetic detection on lateral flow\nassays\nmakes this technique attractive for infectious disease diagnosis.\nWhile magnetic detection necessitates instrumentation for result readout,\niron-containing magnetic nanoparticles also have the added advantage\nof being highly absorbent visual labels.347 Thus, magnetic nanoparticles can potentially be applied to different\nuse-case scenarios with differing sensitivity requirements. In a use-case\nscenario such as morbidity control, where it is most important to\nidentify high-intensity infections in the field, the visual detection\nof magnetic particles would be sufficient. When improved sensitivity\nis desired to detect low-intensity infections for epidemiological\nor surveillance purposes, analysis using the current instrumentation\nfor reading magnetic nanoparticle labels could be performed in a district\nhospital or laboratory. However, further work on miniaturization of\ninstrumentation and validation of hand-held readers will be required\nfor field application of magnetic detection on lateral flow assays.\n\nAs\ndiscussed in previous sections, electrochemical detection offers several\nbenefits for POC infectious disease detection, namely that it is inexpensive,\nsensitive, rapid, and quantitative. The electrochemical detection\nsystems previously discussed were largely proof-of-concept diagnostics\nfor detection of protein or nucleic acid biomarkers; the infrastructure\nrequired to carry out these assays would limit their utility in a\nprimary healthcare setting in low- and middle-income countries. Integration\nof validated and field-ready electrochemical detection systems with\ndeveloped electrochemical assays represents a viable strategy for\nimplementing the next generation of POC diagnostics.\n\nThe blood\nglucose biosensor is a remarkably successful electrochemical device\nthat is ubiquitously applied at the point of care. Generally, electrochemical\nglucose meter kits consist of three components: a lancet for sample\ncollection, plastic test strips for wicking of the glucose-containing\nsample and generation of current, and a device for digital readout\nof the generated current.556 The test strips\nhouse an electrochemical cell that contains a counter-reference electrode,\nfill-detection electrode, enzyme-coated working electrode, and mediators\n(Figure 37A). In these\ndevices, the working electrode is coated with the enzyme glucose oxidase\n(GOx) or glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), and the enzyme oxidizes the\nglucose present in a blood sample. Ferrocene derivatives or other\nGroup VIII metal complexes act as mediators to facilitate electron\ntransfer from the enzyme redox center to the electrode surface, thereby\nproducing a measurable current.556 Since\nthe development of the first commercial blood glucose biosensor in\n1987, the use of this technology has drastically expanded with the\ncurrent market now offering numerous blood glucose meters that are\nportable, rapid, sensitive, and quantitative.557 The blood glucose biosensor has had an enormous impact\non management of types I and II diabetes where constant monitoring\nand a rapid time to result are critical to preventing incidences of\nhyper- and hypoglycemia. Successful adaptation of this technology\nfor field detection of infectious diseases would have a profound impact\nin disease surveillance and elimination campaigns, where sensitive\nand quantitative results are desired to best inform healthcare professionals\nabout disease distribution.556,557\n\nSeveral groups have repurposed commercial blood glucose meters\nfor detection of a variety of targets.167,558\u2212562 Xiang and Lu558 developed a platform\nthat utilized a personal glucose meter for signal output to detect\nprotein (IFN-\u03b3), nucleic acid (adenosine), small molecule (cocaine),\nor toxic ion (uranium) targets. Their strategy employed a magnetic\nbead-conjugated aptamer specific for the biomarker of interest. The\naptamer was initially prehybridized to a partially complementary DNA\nstrand that was linked to invertase, an enzyme that catalyzes the\nhydrolysis of sucrose into its fructose and glucose subunits. In biomarker-containing\nsamples, the aptamer bound to the biomarker, releasing the invertase-conjugated\ncomplementary DNA into solution. The magnetic beads were then removed\nfrom solution using an external magnet, and the addition of sucrose\nto the supernatant resulted in glucose production that was readily\ndetectable by a personal glucose meter. While this creative application\nof an extant platform expanded its functionality, it also increased\nthe number of assay steps, potentially limiting its use directly at\nthe point of care. To address this concern, the Lu group562 has since integrated this solution-based assay\ninto a lateral flow strip with dried reagents, eliminating several\nuser steps and further simplifying the platform such that it could\nbe applied at the point of care. This innovative approach is an excellent\nexample of how metal-based sample preparation using magnetic beads\ncan be combined with an existing electrochemical platform for rapid\ndetection of a variety of disease targets.\n\nAs the blood glucose\nmeter clearly demonstrates, portable electrochemical\ninstrumentation has enabled minimally trained users to measure analytes\nat the point of care and rapidly obtain information regarding their\nhealth status. Mobile health technologies (i.e., mobile phones and\ntelemedicine) augment these advances in instrumentation, connecting\nindividual users to an entire healthcare infrastructure. Mobile health\ntechnologies are useful for tracking patient information and facilitating\ncommunication between the patient and the care provider. As these\ntechnologies mature, they are becoming increasingly important for\nmodeling diseases and disease trends throughout various populations.563 Integration of portable electrochemical diagnostics\nwith mobile health technologies in so-called \u201cconnected\u201d\ndiagnostics has been pursued by interfacing electrochemical devices\nwith mobile phones.173,564 Nemiroski and colleagues173 developed a universal mobile electrochemical\ndetector (uMED) that combined a potentiostat with virtually any mobile\nphone using audio-based data transmission (Figure 37B). The device could accommodate several\nelectrochemical techniques (amperometry, coulometry, voltammetry,\nand potentiometry), and the voice system-based data ensured broad\ncompatibility with a variety of mobile phones and networks. The authors\nemployed the uMED to detect blood glucose, heavy metals in water,\nelectrolytes, and malarial biomarker HRP2. Following sample collection\nand measurement using the potentiostat, the user placed a phone call\nto a Skype number in a remote location to vocally report the value\nof the analyte measured. The remote application then extracted the\nvalue from the audio data and sent an SMS message back to the user\nwith additional diagnostic information (e.g., \u201cLOW\u201d\nif the reported blood glucose level was low). Although the uMED was\napplied to detect an infectious disease biomarker (HRP2), it is limited\nby the availability of existing compatible testing technology. For\ninstance, HRP2 detection required an offline 96-well plate ELISA to\nbe conducted prior to analysis on the uMED and transmission over a\nmobile network. As more progress is made in electrochemical diagnostic\ndesign, the uMED and other similar devices will be able to reach their\nfull potential as \u201cconnected\u201d diagnostics.\n\nAs\nbattery-operated and portable devices become more robust, electrochemical\ndetection devices are becoming increasingly viable as POC platforms.\nThe success of the personal glucose meter is a testament to the effective\nand reliable diagnostic performance that is possible with electrochemical\nmeasurements. With the concurrent expansion of information technologies,\n\u201cconnected\u201d electrochemical diagnostics could serve\nas the link between the chemistries utilized at the point of care\nand the remote higher level healthcare systems that map disease trends\nand inform treatment decisions.\n\nIn high-income\ncountries, advances in portable electronics and instrumentation have\nenabled live health tracking at consumers\u2019 fingertips. Wearable\ncommercial health diagnostics such as Apple Watch, Garmin, and FitBit\nare simple to use and provide real-time updates of heart rate, activities\ncompleted, or calories burned. In a similar vein, there are several\nemerging health-centered tools, such as press-on tattoos,565,566 skin patches,567 and face masks,568 capable of detecting changes in human physiology\nat the point of use. In addition, the advent of technologies such\nas Google Glass have allowed for \u201cconnected\u201d interpretation\nof rapid diagnostic tests.515 Overall,\nwearable instruments combine sample collection, sample preparation,\nanalysis and readout, and data transmission into one device, representing\nsignificant progress in diagnosis and health management at the point\nof care.\n\nSmall electrochemical instrumentation has become a\nfocus of innovation, and research in this field has led to a number\nof skin-based wearable diagnostics. Jia et al.565 developed a noninvasive tattoo biosensor capable of monitoring\nlactate levels in human sweat, while another tattoo sensor produced\nby Bandodkar et al.566 detected glucose\nin the interstitial fluid of the skin (Figure 38A). These technologies are extraordinarily\npromising for future diagnostic devices, particularly as new biomarkers\nof infectious diseases are discovered in surface biofluids such as\nsweat.569\n\nRecent advances in microprojection570,571 and microneedle572,573 technology have allowed researchers\nto expand the use of skin-based\nwearables beneath the surface of skin. In several applications, patches\nconsisting of many microprojections were easily applied to the skin\nwith a gentle press and could draw hundreds of microliters of blood\nwith little-to-no pain.567,574\u2212576 In 2014, Lee et al.567 outlined the design\nof a multiplexed patch that captured both IgG and malarial biomarker\nHRP2 from the skin of inoculated mice. The patch consisted of microprojection\narrays (MPAs) that were subsequently functionalized with anti-HRP2\nantibodies, Fc-specific antimouse IgG antibodies, and antidengue antibodies.\nThe anti-HRP2-functionalized MPAs detected the biomarker, while the\nanti-IgG-functionalized MPAs acted as a positive control for skin\npenetration, and the antidengue-functionalized MPA served as a negative\ncontrol. Though sample collection and preparation were applicable\nat the point of use, the assay required an ELISA for colorimetric\nreadout of the captured antigen. Further research into integration\nof this technology with a diagnostic such as a stacked paper-based\nassay would allow for real-time skin-based monitoring of infectious\ndiseases.\n\nAnother forthcoming application for wearable instrumentation\nis\nin breath analysis via paper masks. G\u00fcder et al.568 developed an electrical sensor to monitor respiration.\nThe sensor consisted of a paper surgical mask printed with graphite\nelectrodes that were attached to a battery and signal amplifier. As\na user breathed, the humidity changes from the inhalation and exhalation\ngenerated a measurable current across the electrode, which was then\ndetected using a Bluetooth-connected mobile device (Figure 38B). As this technology evolves,\nit may be possible to adapt it for analysis of breath-based biomarkers,\nparticularly for respiratory infectious diseases such as tuberculosis\nand influenza. In addition, incorporating the external battery/amplifier\npack into the material of the mask may open avenues for broader distribution,\nparticularly to low-resource areas.\n\nLikewise, personal computer\ndisplays such as Google Glass have\nenabled users to harness the power of a technological workstation\nin a hands-free glasses format. This capacity could significantly\nimprove diagnostic capabilities and effectiveness. In 2014, Feng et\nal.515 developed a method of lateral flow\nassay analysis which combined visual examination of a lateral flow\ntest with computerized image analysis and wireless storage capability\n(Figure 38C). This\nwearable imaging technique allowed users to collect images of tests\nand store them in a cloud-based system or locally on the Google Glass\nheadset if Internet access was unavailable. Once the Google Glass\nheadset was connected to a wireless network, the test images could\nbe sent to a secure server to be analyzed, and then the test\u2019s\nresults and analysis were sent back to the viewer\u2019s eyepiece.\nThis method has been demonstrated using rapid diagnostic tests for\nboth HIV antibodies and prostate specific antigen (PSA),515 though it has the potential to be adapted for\nany lateral flow assay with visual labels. While the use of computer-based\nimaging may remove some of the inaccuracies that arise from subjective\nhuman-based interpretation of results, it must also be noted that\nthere are a number of technological hurdles that should first be addressed.\nThe Google Glass is not capable of autofocusing, and the images were\ntaken under good lighting against white and universally solid, simple\nbackdrops. Thus, this technology is limited in its field application.\nIn addition, test recognition was dependent on preprinted QR codes\nthat were prepared and attached to the tests by researchers before\nuse. In order to more efficiently utilize this technology, the Google\nGlass application could be adapted to identify test features without\nthe need for a user-supplied QR code and web-based test input. This\nwould simplify the workflow and allow for more high-throughput analysis\nof diagnostic tests.\n\nOverall, there is significant room for\ngrowth and development in\nthe field of wearable instrumentation. Wearable diagnostics, which\nmay have previously seemed more at home in the world of science fiction,\nare becoming commonplace in health-related research efforts. The development\nof wearable diagnostic technologies could drastically improve the\nsimplicity of diagnostic measurements and interpretation in regions\nwith little or no laboratory infrastructure. As these technologies\ncontinue to be developed for applications in high-resource areas of\nthe world, the scientific community would be remiss not to consider\nthe impact they could have on infectious disease diagnosis in resource-limited\nsettings.\n\nThus far, we have highlighted\ninnovative examples of metal-based\nstrategies for improving point-of-care diagnosis of infectious diseases\nbased primarily on protein and inorganic disease biomarkers. In most\ncases, leveraging inorganic chemistry for sample preparation methods\nand detection probes would require minimal modification for application\nat the point of care. It is clear that, despite the potential trade-offs\nin complexity of workflow and instrumentation, the increased sensitivity\noffered by these metal-based strategies for biomarker detection could\nsignificantly improve morbidity control and elimination efforts.\n\nIn many instances, though, sensitive and quantitative detection\nof the presence or absence of a disease does not paint the full picture\nneeded to implement successful control or elimination campaigns. In\nsome cases, the pathogen\u2019s own genetic material must be detected\nand extensively studied on a population scale in order to inform strategy.\nThis research provides valuable information on pathogen species and\nstrain distribution and drug resistance, which can inform treatment\nand diagnostic strategies in a control or elimination campaign.579\n\nThe information-rich and highly specific\nnature of nucleic acid\ndetection makes these biomarkers attractive targets for point-of-care\ndiagnostics. In fact, several groups have begun to apply some of the\nmetal-based detection strategies for proteins and inorganic biomarkers\ndiscussed in the preceding sections to the detection of pathogenic\nDNA or RNA.231,234,235,273,580\u2212587 For instance, many metal-containing nanoparticle probes have been\nfunctionalized to detect pathogen-specific nucleic acid sequences\nin a variety of formats. The size-dependence of SPR for noble-metal\nnanoparticles has been leveraged in an aggregation assay for multiplexed\ndetection of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, M. tuberculosis, and HPV in a \u03bcPAD format.231 The high conductivity of AgNPs has been exploited\nfor electrochemical detection of M. tuberculosis and HIV.234,235 Luminescent particles (i.e.,\nquantum dots, europium chelate-doped particles, and upconverting phosphors)\nhave been functionalized for the detection of a myriad of diseases,\nincluding HIV,273,580\u2212583 HBV,273 HCV,273 HPV,584P. falciparum malaria,585Bacillus cereus,581,582,586,587 and Streptococcus pyogenes.581 Moreover, these nanoparticle-based\nmethods occur in a variety of formats, including lateral flow assays.\n\nBecause specific nucleic acid sequences are typically present at\nmuch lower concentrations than protein biomarkers in patient samples,\na target amplification step is often required before the detection\nmethod can be applied. The most common target amplification technique\nis PCR, a time-consuming enzyme-based method that requires technical\nexpertise, expensive equipment, and significant laboratory infrastructure.\nThese requirements are the primary barriers to sensitive detection\nof pathogen genetic material in the field. Fortunately, alternative\ntarget amplification techniques with potential point-of-care applications\nhave emerged. For example, the biobarcode signal amplification strategy\ndiscussed in section 4.4.4 has been adapted for amplification of nucleic acid targets.464 However, in general, isothermal enzymatic amplification\ntechniques have demonstrated the most sensitivity and promise for\npoint-of-care diagnostic applications.\n\nIsothermal amplification\ntechniques do not require any thermal\ncycling, are simpler to operate, and require fewer resources when\ncompared to traditional PCR. This class of enzymatic amplification\ntechniques includes loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP),\nhelicase-dependent amplification (HDA), rolling circle amplification\n(RCA), multiple displacement amplification (MDA), recombinase polymerase\namplification (RPA), and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification\n(NASBA).588 Among these strategies, LAMP\nis one of the most widely validated, having been employed for amplification\nof nucleic acid targets for a variety of diseases and infections.\nThese include targets for malaria,589\u2212592 HIV,593 HPV,594Bordetella pertussis,595C. trachomatis,595,596Neisserie gonorrheae,595 H1N1 influenza,595,597E. coli,598 and several filarial parasites.599 In\naddition to malaria diagnosis, LAMP has also been used to detect artemisinin\nresistance in P. falciparum malaria.600 This technique consists of iterative elongation\nand recycling of stem-loop DNA structures, usually requiring a constant\ntemperature between 60 and 65 \u00b0C.588 The relatively simple workflow of LAMP (when compared to other enzymatic\namplification techniques) and its potential for colorimetric visual\nreadout have led to the development of several low-resource devices\nfor nucleic acid detection. One example is the noninstrumented nucleic\nacid amplification device (NINA), which relies on an exothermal chemical\nreaction (MgFe powder, saline, and oxygen) coupled to a phase change\nmaterial for prolonged and precise heating inside a Thermos cup.589,601 Despite its streamlined workflow, the NINA device does not account\nfor sample preparation. The preamplification nucleic acid extraction\nstep still requires laboratory equipment such as a heated water bath\nand a centrifuge.589 Although the amplification\nstep itself has been modified for use at the point of care, the complete\nprotocol relegates it to the laboratory environment.\n\nIn an effort\nto mitigate these limitations, the Klapperich group594 has developed an inventive method in which\nnucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection are fully integrated\ninto a single paper fluidic device. To accomplish this, DNA from clinical\nsamples was precipitated from solution and applied to a paper membrane,\nwhich was washed with ethanol to remove impurities. LAMP reaction\nreagents, which included FITC-conjugated forward and biotinylated\nreverse loop primers, were then applied to the sample port, which\nwas sealed for a 30 min heating step on a hot plate. The amplified\nsolution was then wicked onto a lateral flow assay equipped with anti-FITC\nantibodies on the test line and streptavidin-coated AuNPs for detection\n(Figure 39). In the\npresence of the target, both primers hybridized to the amplified genetic\nmaterial, forming a \u201csandwich\u201d on the lateral flow assay\nand resulting in a visible test line signal.594\n\nThis all-in-one paper-based nucleic acid test is a perfect\nexample\nof how target extraction and amplification can be innovatively combined\nwith metal-based detection elements. This integration will allow for\ncomplex nucleic acid detection protocols to be performed at the point\nof care that previously were only possible in well-equipped laboratories.\nMoving forward, several considerations must be addressed, including\nintegration of laboratory-free heating elements, reducing the number\nof user steps, and large-scale manufacturing feasibility. Nonetheless,\ncombination of the paper-based devices developed by the Klapperich\ngroup with simple, integrated heating elements similar to the NINA\ndevice could allow for sensitive and information-rich nucleic acid\ndetection in low resource settings. This would enable case management\nand elimination strategies to be precisely carried out in nearly any\nhealthcare setting.\n\nThe application of inorganic chemistry\nand nanomaterials to point-of-care\ninfectious disease diagnosis has enhanced the sensitivity and specificity\nof diagnostic tests, leading to improved outcomes and reduced transmission.\nThe sample preparation and detection methods presented herein are\npromising examples of how metal-based strategies can expand the use-case\nscenarios of diagnostic tests, resulting in access to care that would\notherwise be unattainable. However, we have also seen that these same\nmetal-based strategies that improve diagnostic sensitivity and specificity\ncan lead to more complex tests, potentially requiring more user steps,\nexpertise, and time to complete.\n\nThese trade-offs of complexity,\ncost, and speed must be weighed\nagainst the potential impact that improved sensitivity and specificity\ncould have in a given use-case scenario. For example, in the case\nof morbidity control, where the goal is to reduce the prevalence of\nhigh-intensity infections, the demand for simple, affordable, and\nrapid tests likely outweighs the need for highly sensitive tests.\nOnce in the elimination phase, however, where the goal is to completely\ninterrupt local transmission, high sensitivity tests are imperative\nfor detecting and treating low-density infections. Consequently, the\nneed for more sensitive diagnostics likely outweighs small increases\nin test complexity or cost for elimination campaigns.\n\nIn our\nevaluation of various inorganic complexes and nanomaterials,\nadvantages and caveats became apparent for different classes of materials.\nThe properties of these materials directly affect how they can be\napplied in diagnostics. Noble metal nanoparticles have frequently\nbeen incorporated into paper-based assays, such as lateral flow assays,\nwith visual signal readout because of their stability and superior\nmolar absorptivities.219,221,229,231 Despite the strong optical signal\nthat noble metal nanoparticles afford, these colorimetric assays are\noften still limited by poor sensitivity. This potentially limits their\nimpact in a use-case scenario such as an elimination campaign.\n\nIf better sensitivity is needed, there are essentially three metal-based\nstrategies that we have discussed in this review for further improvement:\n(1) sample preparation for biomarker enrichment, (2) luminescent detection\nprobes, and (3) signal amplification techniques. The IMAC-functionalized\nmaterials used for sample preparation collectively represent one approach\nfor improving assay sensitivity by enriching the biomarker concentration.\nWhile some of the sample preparation methods demonstrated increased\ndiagnostic sensitivity, these methods did add to the number of user\nsteps.85,99,113\u2212115,117 Metal-based sample preparation\nis perhaps the simplest of the three metal-based approaches to increasing\nsensitivity; however, for it to be truly impactful, it will need to\nbe incorporated into diagnostics that are developed with the end user\nin mind such that the overall workflow is considered and the assay\nsteps are minimized.\n\nAlternatively, noble metal nanoparticles\ncan be replaced with luminescent\ndetection probes to afford greater sensitivity. Quantum dots, lanthanide\nchelate-doped nanoparticles, and up-converting phosphor nanoparticles\nall potentially offer improvements in sensitivity over colorimetric\nlabels, albeit through different mechanisms.257,289,305,309 While luminescent inorganic complexes were incorporated into proof-of-principle\nassays for the detection of infectious disease biomarkers, they have\nyet to be utilized in a field-deployable format and lack the sensitivity\nof the aforementioned nanomaterials.138,139 Quantum dots\nand up-converting phosphor nanoparticles also have the capability\nfor multiplexing that could be beneficial for case management.252,253,310 Although the various luminescent\nnanoparticles offer improvements in sensitivity, they also require\nmore instrumentation for signal readout. The increased cost and complexity\nof signal readout for luminescent nanoparticles must therefore be\nconsidered when developing diagnostic strategies to combat infectious\ndiseases.\n\nLastly, metal-based signal amplification techniques\ncould be incorporated\nto improve sensitivity. Almost all of the signal amplification techniques\ndiscussed in this review (metalloenzyme-based amplification, nanoparticle\ndissolution, nanoparticle enzyme mimics, reductive nanoparticle enlargement,\nand biobarcodes) offer colorimetric readouts with improved sensitivity.\nHowever, these improvements come at the cost of an increased number\nof assay steps and thus longer total assay times. While some efforts,\nsuch as the p24 LFAs developed by Loynachan et al.,435 demonstrated progress toward more field-friendly signal\namplification methods, further improvements in the ease of use and\ntime to result must be made to translate these methods to primary\nhealthcare facilities.\n\nFor these metal-based strategies that\nimprove sensitivity, it is\nclear that simplifying the user interface is a significant challenge\nthat remains. Aside from the user interface, there are several other\nchallenges to translating novel diagnostic strategies that must be\nconsidered before implementation. These include: (1) the need for\nclinical validation, (2) the potential for large-scale manufacturability,\n(3) the availability of distribution channels, and (4) integration\ninto current health systems. Most of the metal-based strategies for\nimproved infectious disease diagnostics presented in this review have\ndemonstrated some level of feasibility in a small set of patient or\nmock clinical samples. However, new technology must be clinically\nvalidated on a large set of patient samples from endemic regions before\nimplementation. Such studies provide insight into the diagnostic performance\nand tolerance of day-to-day and interpatient variation in the appropriate\nclinical context. This rigor can draw attention to challenges and\nweaknesses that would otherwise go unnoticed in a research laboratory\nsetting.\n\nProduction scalability of novel diagnostic technology\nis another\nimportant consideration for successful translation. Even in the research\nphase of diagnostic development, material choice, device design, and\nfabrication should be based, in part, on manufacturing scalability\nin order to streamline implementation. Many of the metal-based strategies\npresented in this review, particularly the diverse inorganic nanoparticle\ndetection probes used in lateral flow assays, are advantageous in\nthis context because they are easily integrated into existing LFA\nmanufacturing infrastructure.\n\nBeyond the laboratory, it is important\nto consider distribution\nchannels and how novel tools will be integrated into existing health\nsystems. Region-specific health delivery systems and their respective\nregulatory approvals are ultimately what define a novel diagnostic\ndevice\u2019s implementation. For example, in one region, most rapid\ntesting for infectious diseases may be performed at local health clinics\nrun by a national ministry of health, whereas in another area, privately\nrun dispensaries may be the most common source of primary health care.\nUnderstanding the structural differences between such health delivery\nsystems as well as the respective availability of resources could\nimpact device design in the research phase.\n\nAlthough there are\nmany considerations and barriers to translating\nnovel technologies to the clinical setting, we are optimistic that\nthe continued development of metal-based point-of-care diagnostic\nstrategies will have a profound impact on global health. Returning\nto the example presented in the introduction, if some of the ultrasensitive\np24 detection methods presented in this review396,435 were adapted for use at primary healthcare facilities, the time\nto result for infant HIV diagnosis at the point of need would be significantly\nreduced. In areas like Burkina Faso, this would enable earlier initiation\nof very effective antiretroviral therapies and drastically reduce\ninfant mortality stemming from opportunistic infections.\n\nFinally,\nthe continually increasing connectivity in low- and middle-income\ncountries coupled to sensitive diagnostics will allow for real-time\ndisease surveillance, intervention analysis, and epidemiological studies.\n\u201cConnected\u201d diagnostics have the potential to accelerate\ncommunications between field workers, local health outposts, district\nhospitals, and national health ministries. The ability to rapidly\nconvey diagnostic results could not only enable active case detection\nstrategies but also would provide faster responses to epidemics such\nas the 2014\u20132016 Ebola and 2015\u20132016 Zika outbreaks.\nThese faster responses could potentially reduce mortality and improve\nclinical outcomes.\n\nMetal-based strategies for sample preparation\nand signal generation\nshow great promise for use in the development and improvement of sensitive\ndiagnostic devices for low-resource settings. These devices, coupled\nwith connected, field-deployable instrumentation, will empower rapid\nresponse, effective control, and successful elimination of infectious\ndiseases worldwide, ushering in an era of sustainable and improved\nglobal health."}
