{"title": "Post-pandemic assessment of public knowledge, behavior, and skill on influenza prevention among the general population of Beijing, China", "body": "Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009, a new strain of triplereassortant influenza A virus composed of a combination of human, swine, and Eurasian avian strains, spread rapidly through more than 200 countries 1 and was the first global pandemic of the 21st century. 2,3 On August 10, 2010 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that we had entered the post-pandemic period and the H1N1 virus had taken on the behavior of a seasonal influenza virus. 4 There was an effective control and prevention campaign during and after the 2009 influenza pandemic in Beijing, which included identifying, treating, and isolating people who had the disease and educating the public about the steps that individuals could take to reduce the risk of transmission. Meanwhile, health education campaigns touching on good hygiene practices and social distancing were implemented in hospitals, schools, local communities, and through mass media. 5 Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, the government of China has strengthened its surveillance and established the prevention and control system for infectious disease. 6 The level of science and technology in this field in China has since improved significantly. Compared with the abundant research on how the government and institutions could improve the surveillance management and prevention system, there have been few public reports assessing the effect of these policies and the level of health literacy associated with influenza prevention in the general population.\n\nBackground: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, behavioral, and skill responses toward influenza in the general population of Beijing after pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Beijing, China, in January 2011. A survey was conducted in which information was collected using a standardized questionnaire. A comprehensive evaluation index system of health literacy related to influenza was built to evaluate the level of health literacy regarding influenza prevention and control among residents in Beijing. Results: Thirteen thousand and fifty-three valid questionnaires were received. The average score for the sum of knowledge, behavior, and skill was 14.12 AE 3.22, and the mean scores for knowledge, behavior, and skill were 4.65 AE 1.20, 7.25 AE 1.94, and 2.21 AE 1.31, respectively. The qualified proportions of these three sections were 23.7%, 11.9%, and 43.4%, respectively, and the total proportion with a qualified level was 6.7%. There were significant differences in health literacy level related to influenza among the different gender, age, educational level, occupational status, and location groups (p < 0.05). There was a significant association between knowledge and behavior (r = 0.084, p < 0.001), and knowledge and skill (r = 0.102, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The health literacy level remains low among the general population in Beijing and the extent of relativities in knowledge, behavior, and skill about influenza was found to be weak. Therefore, improvements are needed in terms of certain aspects, particularly for the elderly and the population of rural districts. Educational level, as a significant factor in reducing the spread of influenza, should be considered seriously when intervention strategies are implemented. \u00df 2014 The Authors.

After the 2009 pandemic, it was necessary to collect some baseline data to understand and monitor public perceptions and behaviors. We conducted a survey in six districts of Beijing, China, in early 2011 to assess the influenza-related health literacy level in the general population of Beijing after the 2009 influenza pandemic, and to explore the behavior and skill factors affecting the incidence level of influenza.\n\nA cross-sectional study was conducted in Beijing, China, in January 2011. Subjects were recruited via a multi-stage stratified cluster sampling technique. First, three urban districts and three rural districts were selected randomly from a total of 18 districts in Beijing. Five sub-districts/towns were then selected randomly in each of the six districts, from which five communities were selected randomly. Lastly, 18 subjects for each age group (18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and !60 years) were recruited from each community, with equal weighting of the sexes.\n\nThe standardized interview questionnaire was designed to collect the following data: (1) socio-demographic characteristics (gender, age, education, occupation, and general health status); (2) knowledge about the disease and its symptoms; (3) practices towards influenza and people with influenza-like-illness (i.e., avoidance practices, cough etiquette, use of masks, hand washing, being vaccinated, health-seeking behaviors); (4) perceived ability to avoid illness; (5) attitudes towards the vaccine, and (6) comprehension of health materials related to influenza (i.e., medication instructions, educational information about influenza and the vaccine). Lastly, participants were asked to gauge their ability to use a thermometer.\n\nQuestions were divided into three sections under the headings of knowledge, behaviors, and skills.\n\nAfter obtaining informed consent from the subject, the survey was administered by face-to-face interview. For the purpose of analysis, each question that was answered positively was given a score of 1 and each question that was answered negatively or was answered as 'don't know' was given a score of 0. The total score for the three sections was 24 points: the total score for 'knowledge' was 7 points, and a qualified level was considered to be 6-7 points; the total score for 'behavior' was 13 points, and a qualified level was considered to be 10-13 points; the total score for 'skill' was 4 points, and a qualified level was considered to be 3-4 points.\n\nQuestionnaire data were entered in duplicate using EpiData software, and data were analyzed using SPSS 18 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics, such as percentages, means, and standard deviations, were calculated. To analyze the significance of the continuous data, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied. Chi-square tests of significance were used for analyses of categorical variables regarding the qualified proportion of the three sections. The relationships among knowledge, behavior, and skill were analyzed by correlation analysis. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05 for all analyses.\n\nThis study was approved by the institutional review board and human research ethics committee of the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC).\n\nA total of 13 286 adults were approached; 13 053 valid questionnaires were received, giving an effective response rate was 98.1%. The demographic characteristics of participants are reported in Table 1 .\n\nThe average score for the sum of knowledge, behavior, and skill was 14.12 AE 3.22, and the mean scores for knowledge, behavior, and skill were 4.65 AE 1.20, 7.25 AE 1.94, and 2.21 AE 1.31, respectively. The statistic of the total score of these three sections was found to follow an approximately normal distribution.\n\nThe overall mean score for knowledge was 4.65 AE 1.20, and 23.7% of participants met the qualified standard of knowledge. Both the overall knowledge score and the qualified proportion for knowledge were significantly higher in urban areas compared to rural areas (F = 63.968, p < 0.001; Chi-square = 12.701, p < 0.001). The mean knowledge score fell significantly with increasing age (F = 31.064, p < 0.001) and increased significantly with higher educational levels (F = 158.175, p < 0.001) ( Table 2 ). The qualified proportion in the different age groups fell significantly with increasing age (Chi-square = 20.991, p < 0.001) and increased significantly with higher educational levels (Chi-square = 92.145, p < 0.001) ( Table 3) .\n\nMales had a significantly higher mean score for behavior than females (F = 92.904, p < 0.001). The mean score of urban residents was significantly higher than that of rural residents (F = 54.786, p < 0.001). The mean score in the different age groups fell significantly with increasing age (F = 5.965, p < 0.001) and there was a significant rise with the increase in educational level (F = 99.843, p < 0.001) ( Table 2) .\n\nOf the participants, 11.9% met the qualified standard of behavior. Males had a significantly higher qualified proportion Table 3 The qualified proportions for knowledge, behavior, and skill about influenza among respondents Group of behavior than females (Chi-square = 13.066, p < 0.001) and there was a significant rise with increasing educational levels (Chisquare = 61.584, p < 0.001) ( Table 3 ).\n\nUrban residents had a significantly higher mean score for skill than rural residents (F = 428.286, p < 0.001). The mean score for the different age groups fell significantly with increasing age (F = 217.352, p < 0.001) and increased significantly with higher educational levels (F = 770.232, p < 0.001). There was a significant difference among the three occupational status levels (F = 21.669, p < 0.001), with the group of students having the highest mean score (2.57 AE 1.27) and the non-working group having the lowest mean score (2.14 AE 1.30) ( Table 2) .\n\nOf the participants, 43.4% met the qualified standard of skill. The qualified proportion of skill in urban residents was significantly higher than in rural residents (Chi-square = 125.588, p < 0.001). The qualified proportion in the different age groups fell significantly with increasing age (Chi-square = 477.533, p < 0.001) and increased significantly with higher educational levels (Chi-square = 1322.136, p < 0.001). There was a significant difference among the three occupational status levels (Chisquare = 31.165, p < 0.001), with the group of students having the highest qualified proportion (53.9%) and the non-working group having the lowest qualified proportion (40.6%) ( Table 3) .\n\nThere were positive correlations between knowledge and behavior, and knowledge and skill, which were statistically significant (p < 0.001). However, the extent was weak, as the correlation coefficients were r = 0.084 and r = 0.102, respectively (Table 4 ).\n\nIn recent years, pandemic influenza, as a global public health problem, has caused worldwide concerns. 8, 9 Many previous studies have shown that the risk of seasonal or pandemic influenza infection depends on biological characteristics, individual or collective behaviors, and the environmental context. 10 Research has been done on the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 among the Chinese general population, 11 but a related study has not been reported from Beijing. This study could provide some important information to fill the gaps in this field. It was necessary and valuable for us to conduct the study to determine the overall level of influenzarelated health literacy in the general population of Beijing after the 2009 pandemic, data that provide a baseline for influenza prevention and control strategies in the future. Furthermore, our assessment may help shape policy and provide information to the international community.\n\nIn this study we found that the qualified proportion of urban residents was significantly higher than that of rural residents; this was considered to be associated with socio-economic factors, such as income and medical resources allocation, 12,13 as well as the ability to access health information. The socio-economic status in rural areas is significantly lower than in urban areas; rural residents are always less likely to obtain the recommended preventive healthcare services, 14 and their limited ability to acquire information via modern media systems 15 impedes the dissemination of health information among rural dwellers. In addition, most public education activities are currently carried out in the communities of urban districts, hence the public awareness of influenza-related knowledge, behavior, and skill of rural residents is lower than that of urban residents.\n\nIn this study, education was found to be the most important factor influencing levels of infectious disease health literacy, and past research on the relationship between education and health has drawn similar conclusions. Howard et al 16 found that if health literacy levels were similar, differences in self-reported health status by education would be about 20% lower. There is also some indirect evidence. Goldman and Smith 17 found that well-educated patients are better able to manage complicated self-care regimens in HIV/AIDS and diabetes. Other studies have found that education is linked to faster adoption of new medical technologies 18 and that consumer knowledge is linked to the increased use of preventive care. 19 In this study, the qualified levels of all three sections (knowledge, behavior, and skill) in the general population were significantly higher (p < 0.001) with a higher level of education, which is similar to the nationwide health literacy level of China. 20, 21 At present, different intervention strategies aimed at populations with different levels of education should be implemented.\n\nCompared with younger people, the older age groups had worse health literacy related to influenza. The qualified proportion in the older age group was significantly lower than that in the younger group. Older adults have lower immunity and ability to fight off disease and are at higher risk of becoming infected with influenza viruses. The risk of influenza-related complications and deaths among the elderly are significantly higher than in younger people. 22 The results of Beijing's sixth population census showed the proportion of elderly (!60 years) to be 12.5%, 23 demonstrating that Beijing has already become an aging society. The statistics in this study indicated that the influenza-related health literacy level among elderly residents in Beijing was low. As a high-risk and susceptible population, the elderly should be paid more attention with regard to influenza prevention and control.\n\nThere were positive correlations among knowledge, behavior, and skill about influenza, but the extent was weak. This indicates that there is still a gap in knowledge, behavior, and skill. Full knowledge about the prevention of influenza does not mean reasonable behavior or skill. It is necessary to carry out various types of health education program aimed at behavior and skill.\n\nThe study has a few limitations. First, some data were selfreported, which could have led to problems of recall bias. Second, this study was a sampling survey, which will inevitably have had a sampling bias. However, because the participants were selected from communities by strict random sampling, it is believed that they do represent the general population of Beijing. Thirdly, there were no baseline data for influenza-related health literacy in the general population of Beijing for the pre-pandemic period, so we cannot know whether the health literacy level of people was improved after In recent years, pandemic influenza, as a global public health problem, has caused worldwide concerns. 8, 9 Many previous studies have shown that the risk of seasonal or pandemic influenza infection depends on biological characteristics, individual or collective behaviors and the environmental context. 10 As there has been no related study reported in Beijing, this study could provide some important information to fill gaps in this field. It was necessary and valuable for us to conduct the study to determine the overall level of influenza-related health literacy in the general population of Beijing after the 2009 pandemic, data that provide a baseline for influenza prevention and control strategies in the future. Furthermore, our assessment may help shape policy and provide information to the international community.\n\nIn conclusion, following the H1N1 2009 pandemic, the general population of Beijing has some correct knowledge, practices, and skills related to influenza, however this health literacy level is low and the extent of relativities in knowledge, behavior, and skill about influenza was found to be weak. Improvements are needed in terms of certain aspects, particularly for the elderly and the population of rural districts. Educational level, as a significant factor in reducing the spread of influenza, should be considered seriously when intervention strategies are implemented, and we should provide more individual health counseling and education services for residents."}
