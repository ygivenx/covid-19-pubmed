For transfection, the cells were plated in six\u2010well plates, grown to 30% confluence, and were transfected with synthetic oligonucleotides using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instruction.\n\nAccording to the manufacturer's protocol, total RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies). Reverse\u2010transcribed cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). GAPDH mRNA was used as an endogenous control for the expression of SCARB2 and EV71 VP1 genomic RNA.

Real\u2010time PCR was performed using a standard protocol on an Applied Biosystems 7300 system using SYBR green PCR master mix (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instruction. All reactions were performed in triplicate and relative expression was analyzed using the \u0394\u0394Ct method.\n\nCells were collected and lysed using RIPA lysis buffer (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 12 000 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Total protein concentrations were determined using the Bicinchoninic Acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Proteins were analyzed by SDS/PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by Odyssey Blocking buffer (LI\u2010COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA), and the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies specific for SCARB2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), EV71 VP1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 4 h at room temperature (RT). After five washes with PBS\u20100.1% Tween\u201020 (PBS\u2010T buffer), the membranes were incubated with IRDye 800 goat anti\u2010mouse IgG or IRDye 680 donkey anti\u2010rabbit IgG (LI\u2010COR Biosciences) at 1 : 10 000 dilution for 1 h and visualized using Li\u2010COR Odyssey Infrared Imager (LI\u2010COR Biosciences). Bands were quantified by densitometric analysis using odyssey software.\n\nEnterovirus 71 Fuyang0805 strain was propagated on Vero cells. Vero cells were grown in 96\u2010well plates, 24 h before virus infection. EV71 was serially diluted with DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS from 103\u2010 to 1010\u2010fold, and a dilution of EV71 was added to triplicate wells. The plates were then incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. The cytopathic effect (CPE) was recorded under the microscope after 3 days. Virus titers were calculated as the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) using the Reed\u2013M\u00fcnch method.\n\nThe wild\u2010type pmirGLO\u2010SCARB2 3\u2032 UTR reporter plasmid was constructed by inserting the 3\u2032 UTR (nucleotides 270\u20131240) of SCARB2 into the pmirGLO luciferase vector between the XhoI and XbaI sites. The SCARB2 3\u2032 UTR was amplified from cDNA using forward primer F (5\u2032 \u2010CCGCTCGAGTTGTTGGGTGCTGGTAGCTC\u20103\u2032) and the reverse primer R (5\u2032\u2010GCTCTAGAGGTGTCTCTGCTTCTGGTCC\u20103\u2032). The mutant pmirGLO\u2010SCARB2 3\u2032 UTR construct was generated by inducing a point mutation using the overlap extension PCR method.\n\nFor the luciferase assay, 293T cells were plated at a density of 1 \u00d7 105 cells per well in 24\u2010well plates and luciferase reporter plasmids and pLR\u2010Tk (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) were cotransfected into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies). After 48 h of incubation, the cells were harvested, washed once with PBS, and lysed with Passive lysis buffer (Promega). Supernatants were collected after 15 min, and centrifuged at 12 000 g for 30 s. The luciferase activities were measured using a dual\u2010luciferase reporter system (Promega).\n\nCells were seeded on glass coverslips, and were infected with EV71 at the indicated time, followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After being washed twice with PBS, the cells were treated with specific primary antibodies against the proteins. The respective secondary antibody was Alexa Fluor 594\u2010labeled donkey anti\u2010mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Life technologies) diluted at 1 : 1000. Images were acquired with an Olympus Fluoview FV10i laser scanning confocal microscope (Tokyo, Japan).\n\nThe cells were dispersed with PBS containing 0.02% EDTA, harvested, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with the SCARB2\u2010specific antibody (diluted 1 : 100, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) in PBS containing 1% BSA at room temperature for 1 h, followed by incubation with the Alexa Fluor 488\u2010labeled goat anti\u2010mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Life technologies) at 1 : 1000 for 30 min. SCARB2 protein on the cell surface was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) using a flowjo software (TreeStar Software, San Carlos, CA, USA).\n\nThe statistical analyses were performed using prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Differences between experimental groups were statistically evaluated using Student's t\u2010test. P\u2010value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001). All the results are presented as means \u00b1 SD of at least three independent experiments.\n\nRecently, Siebert, et al. 29 reported that miR\u2010127\u20105p targeted SCARB2 3\u2032 UTR and reduced the protein expression of SCARB2. As a cellular receptor, SCARB2 can facilitate efficient EV71 infection 35. Firstly, we observed the differential surface expression of SCARB2 on HeLa and HepG2 cells (Fig. 1A), and showed that this differential expression of SCARB2 appears to impact on the susceptibility of HeLa and HepG2 cells to EV71 infection (Fig. 1B). We found that the progression of cytopathic effects in HepG2 cells was slower than that in HeLa cells, suggesting that the efficiency of EV71 infection was correlated with the level of cell surface SCARB2 expression (Fig. 1A,B). Additionally, we also found that HeLa cells expressed a relative lower level of miR\u2010127\u20105p (Fig. 1C). We then investigated if miR\u2010127\u20105p directly suppresses SCARB2 expression by transfecting miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics into both HeLa and HepG2 cells, and then measuring the expression of both SCARB2 mRNA and the protein. We found that miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics significantly reduced both the mRNA level (Fig. 1D) and protein expression of SCARB2 (Fig. 1E), consistent with the previous observations obtained from different cell lines 29. Consistent with above observation, a miR\u2010127\u20105p inhibitor significantly increased mRNA level (Fig. 1F) and protein expression of SCARB2 (Fig. 1G), as compared to the negative control. To further verify that the downregulation of SCARB2 expression is due to targeting by miR\u2010127\u20105p, we performed a bioinformatic search using microRNA (http://www.microrna.org/ to identify putative binding site and identified two seed regions at the 3\u2032 UTR of SCARB2 (nucleotides 369\u2013374 and 484\u2013490) that may bind miR\u2010127\u20105p. In order to demonstrate that the binding sites are specific, we constructed expression plasmids of SCARB2 wild\u2010type/mutant 3\u2032 UTR containing the putative miR\u2010127\u20105p\u2010binding sites by cloning into the pmirGLO reporter vector. Mutant reporter constructs were generated with underlined nucleotides indicating the mutated sequences as shown in Fig. 1H. We cotransfected pmirGLO plasmid into 293T cells, along with miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics or negative control mimics. The luciferase activity of SCARB2 3\u2032 UTR wt was significantly reduced in 293T cells treated with miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics, whereas the SCARB2 3\u2032 UTR mut1 or SCARB2 3\u2032 UTR mut2 partly reversed the inhibition of luciferase activity by miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics. Additionally, the luciferase activity in the cells transfected with the SCARB2 3\u2032 UTR mut1/2 vector was unaffected by the miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics (Fig. 1I). This result was in agreement with a previous study showing that miR\u2010127\u20105p had effect on the luciferase activity of pMir\u2010SCARB2 3\u2032 UTR plasmid 29. In summary, these data suggested that SCARB2 is a direct target of miR\u2010127\u20105p and that its expression is modulated by miR\u2010127\u20105p.\n\nWe investigated the expression of miR\u2010127\u20105p in EV71\u2010infected HeLa cells and found that cellular miR\u2010127\u20105p expression at 12 h and 24 h postinfection was 2.8\u2010 and 3\u2010fold higher, respectively, than that of the mock\u2010infected HeLa cells (Fig. 2A). In EV71\u2010infected HepG2 cells, the miR\u2010127\u20105p expression at 12 h and 24 h was 2.4\u2010 and 2.5\u2010fold higher than those of the mock\u2010infected cells, respectively (Fig. 2B). Thus, these results demonstrated that EV71 infection upregulated miR\u2010127\u20105p expression. To investigate whether upregulation of the miR\u2010127\u20105p following EV71 infection could affect SCARB2 expression, quantitative real\u2010time PCR and western blot were performed simultaneously to measure the SCARB2 expression in HeLa (Fig. 2C) and HepG2 cells (Fig. 2D) and, as expected, SCARB2 was slightly, but significantly, downregulated after EV71 infection.\n\nEarlier studies showed that SCARB2 siRNA treatment inhibited EV71 infection 34, 36. Similarly, our results have confirmed that miR\u2010127\u20105p could suppress the SCARB2 expression (Fig. 1A,B). To further substantiate whether modulation of miR\u2010127\u20105p expression would affect the surface expression of SCARB2, we transfected miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics into both HeLa and HepG2 cells, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. The result suggested that upregulation of the miR\u2010127\u20105p level led to a decrease in the surface expression of SCARB2 (Fig. 3A). Therefore, it is of interest to evaluate the effect of miR\u2010127\u20105p on EV71 replication. For this purpose, miR\u2010127\u20105p was overexpressed by miRNA mimics transfection and its effect on EV71 replication was assessed by measuring EV71 VP1 expression, the viral RNA level, viral titer, and percentage of infected cells. EV71 VP1 protein decreased in both HeLa and HepG2 cells overexpressing miR\u2010127\u20105p, as compared to the negative control cells (Fig. 3B). The levels of SCARB2 mRNA (Fig. 3C) and EV71 RNA (Fig. 3D) in cells transfected with miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics were significantly reduced. The EV71 titers at various times postinfection were also significantly suppressed by miR\u2010127\u20105p overexpression, as compared to the control (Fig. 3E). Immunofluorescence staining of viral VP1 showed that the percentage of infected cells in cells overexpressing miR\u2010127\u20105p was reduced by nearly 50%, as compared to the control, at 24 h postinfection (Fig. 3F). When HeLa cells were transfected with increasing concentrations of miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics (10, 20, 40, and 50 nm), followed by EV71 infection, both SCARB2 mRNA and protein levels, as well as EV71 VP1 protein, were inhibited as a function of the dose of miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics (Fig. 3G). These results showed that miR\u2010127\u20105p overexpression downregulated SCARB2 expression and thus significantly reduced EV71 infection.\n\nNext, we performed experiments to determine whether inhibition of endogenous miR\u2010127\u20105p expression affects EV71 replication. A chemically synthesized oligonucleotide with sequence complementary to endogenous miR\u2010127\u20105p was used to inhibit endogenous miR\u2010127\u20105p expression. Such inhibitor oligonucleotides have been shown to sequester intracellular miRNAs and to inhibit their activity in the RNA interference pathway 37, 38. Interestingly, transfection of miR\u2010127\u20105p inhibitor increased the surface SCARB2 expression (Fig. 4A). Moreover, HeLa and HepG2 cells transfected with the miR\u2010127\u20105p inhibitor or NC inhibitor were subsequently infected with EV71, and EV71 VP1 expression, SCARB2 mRNA level, the viral RNA level, and viral titers were determined, respectively. The expression of EV71 VP1 protein (Fig. 4B) in HeLa and HepG2 cells was upregulated by the inhibition of endogenous miR\u2010127\u20105p, as shown by western blot analysis. Consistently, the levels of SCARB2 mRNA (Fig. 4C) and EV71 RNA (Fig. 4D) were also higher in cells transfected with miR\u2010127\u20105p inhibitor than in the negative control cells. We also found that the EV71 titer was significantly higher in cells treated with miR\u2010127\u20105p inhibitor than that in untreated cells (Fig. 4E). In conclusion, these results demonstrated that inhibition of endogenous miR\u2010127\u20105p led to enhancement of EV71 replication.\n\nWe postulate that mechanistically miR\u2010127\u20105p downregulates cellular receptor SCARB2 and thus prevents the EV71 attachment to and entry into the cells. To further investigate the mechanism of miR\u2010127\u20105p inhibition, we conducted a virus attachment analysis to determine if viral attachment is affected by the miR\u2010127\u20105p\u2010mediated down\u2010modulation of SCARB2. The result showed that miR\u2010127\u20105p significantly reduced the amount of VP1, as compared to the control cells (Fig. 5A). The above results suggested that miR\u2010127\u20105p blocked entry of EV71 by inhibiting expression of the viral receptor SCARB2, resulting in the reduction of viral attachment.\n\nPrevious studies reported that viral genomic RNA is directly targeted by host miRNAs 39, 40. In order to rule out the possibility that EV71 genomic RNA is targeted by miR\u2010127\u20105p in our research, studies were carried out to determine if EV71 genomic RNA contains potential target sequences for miR\u2010127\u20105p. It had been demonstrated that hSCARB2, but not mScarb2, bound efficiently to EV71 41. Mouse L929 cells are not susceptible to EV71 infection and allow only inefficient EV71 infection, because they lack the cellular receptor 21, 24, 35. In this study, we used L929 cells to investigate whether EV71 replication initiated by transfection of infectious viral genomic RNA is affected by miR\u2010127\u20105p. High level of miR\u2010127\u20105p was detected in miR\u2010127\u20105p\u2010transfected L929 cells, suggesting that the miR\u2010127\u20105p was efficiently incorporated intracellularly (Fig. 5B). In the L929 cells transfected with EV71 genomic RNA, although increasing amounts of viral RNA were detected, no inhibitory effect of miR\u2010127\u20105p was observed (Fig. 5C). In addition, EV71 VP1 expression showed no difference between the cells overexpressing miR\u2010127\u20105p and the control cells (Fig. 5D). These results demonstrated that miR\u2010127\u20105p suppressed infection of EV71 by downregulating the expression of its major cellular receptor, SCARB2, rather than impairing the intracellular viral replication.\n\nIn recent years, morbidity and mortality due to EV71 infection have increased, whereas the underlying pathogenic mechanisms remain elusive, and intervention and therapeutic approaches are still limited. MicroRNAs serve as multifunctional regulators, and the significance of miRNAs in virus\u2013host interactions is becoming evident. A growing number of studies show that host miRNAs can regulate viral replication by altering the expression of host genes required for viral response 30, 42, 43 or by directly targeting viral genomic RNAs 39, 40, 44. To date, few studies have already explored the effects of miRNAs in EV71 infection; for example, miR\u2010296\u20105p targets the EV71 genome to suppress viral replication 39; miR\u201023b inhibits EV71 replication through downregulation of VP1 protein 45; and our study showed that miR\u201030a inhibited EV71 replication by modulating EV71\u2010induced autophagy 46. In this report, we provided evidence on the effect of cellular miR\u2010127\u20105p on SCARB2 expression and its inhibitory activity on EV71 infection. SCARB2 is considered to be a crucial EV71 receptor 23.\n\nSCARB2 plays critical roles in viral attachment, entry, and uncoating, and it can promote EV71 infection 24. Recently, a study demonstrated that human miR\u2010127\u20105p significantly downregulated SCARB2 protein level by directly targeting SCARB2 mRNA 29. As an important receptor for EV71, reduction in SCARB2 may prevent viral entry during primary infection. Thus, it is plausible to assume that miR\u2010127\u20105p may impact EV71 infection by regulating SCARB2 expression. In the current study, we first analyzed the influence of miR\u2010127\u20105p mimics (Fig. 1E) or inhibitor (Fig. 1F) on the total cellular SCARB2 level by western blotting. Because SCARB2 is a lysosomal protein, and the majority of the protein is located in the lysosome and endosomes, these results will be difficult to accurately reflect the change of surface SCARB2. Therefore, we performed the flow cytometric analysis of the cell surface SCARB2 expression, and the data indicated that overexpression of miR\u2010127\u20105p significantly inhibited the surface SCARB2 expression (Fig. 3A), while inhibition of endogenous miR\u2010127\u20105p significantly elevated the surface SCARB2 (Fig. 4A). Consistently, overexpression of miR\u2010127\u20105p or inhibition of endogenous miRNA\u2010127\u20105p resulted in repressed (Fig. 3B) or enhanced (Fig. 4B) production of EV71, respectively. Results from dual\u2010luciferase assay validated that miR\u2010127\u20105p targeted SCARB2 and thus inhibited protein translation of SCARB2. Studies with SCARB2 mutants and the inability of miR\u2010127\u20105p in inhibition of EV71 replication in L929 cells (Fig. 5B\u2013D) suggested that this miR\u2010127\u20105p\u2010mediated downregulation of SCARB2 was specific and miR\u2010127\u20105p did not target at intracellular or viral sequences.\n\nAs miR\u2010127\u20105p\u2010mediated downregulation of SCARB2 likely impact only on the uninfected cells for their susceptibility to EV71 infection, it is likely that reduced infection is mainly resulted from decreased viral attachment to the cells with miR\u2010127\u20105p\u2010mediated SCARB2 downregulation. Our evidence that VP1 was reduced by more than 50% in cells overexpressing miR\u2010127\u20105p and infected with EV71 for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C illustrated that the downregulated SCARB2 led to the reduced viral attachment. Downregulation of SCARB2 by miR\u2010127\u20105p may be of significance for host defense to the EV71 as the binding of virus to the host cell is the initial step for viral entry; therefore, transient downregulation of cell surface molecules may be an effective strategy to block and reduce viral transmission. As several reports have shown 47, 48, 49, siRNAs can inhibit viral infection through various different mechanisms and can be used to control virus diseases in vivo.\n\nOverall, we identified miR\u2010127\u20105p as a novel EV71 entry inhibitor through targeting SCARB2 expression. To our knowledge this is the first study describing the role of microRNAs in regulating SCARB2 expression during EV71 infection. Endogenous miRNAs may possess advantages over siRNAs on safety and fewer side effects. The current study provides a new perspective for miRNA\u2010mediated antiviral effects and contributes to the better understanding of host\u2013virus interaction mechanisms.\n\nZW conceived and supervised the study.
