{"title": "Novel Immunoglobulin Domain Proteins Provide Insights into Evolution and Pathogenesis Mechanisms of SARS-Related Coronaviruses", "body": "Nidoviruses are an ancient group of lipid-enveloped viruses with non-segmented RNA genomes, which 35 are known to infect oomycetes and animals, including molluscs, arthropods and vertebrates (1). Among 36 them are the coronaviruses (CoVs) which possess the largest known monopartite RNA genomes and are 37 classified into four genera-Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and 38\n\nDeltacoronavirus (2) . Over the past two decades, Beta-CoVs, including the viruses responsible for 39\n\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 40 2012, have emerged as significant local land global health concerns with economic consequences (3, 4) . 41 window size and step size. Open reading frames of virus genomes used in this study were extracted 66 from an NCBI Genbank file. 67 68 Protein sequence analysis 69\n\nTo collect protein homologs, iterative sequence profile searches were conducted by the programs PSI-70 BLAST (Position-Specific Iterated BLAST)(12) and JACKHMMER (15), which searched against the non-71 redundant (nr) protein database of NCBI with a cut-off e-value of 0.005 serving as the significance 72 threshold. Similarity-based clustering was conducted by BLASTCLUST, a BLAST score-based single-linkage 73 clustering method (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/documents/blastclust.html). Multiple sequence 74 alignments were built by the KALIGN (14), MUSCLE(16) and PROMALS3D(17) programs, followed by 75 careful manual adjustments based on the profile-profile alignment, the secondary structure information 76 and the structural alignment. Profile-profile comparison was conducted using the HHpred program (18). 77\n\nThe consensus of the alignment was calculated using a custom Perl script. The alignments were colored 78 using an in-house alignment visualization program written in perl and further modified using adobe 79 illustrator. Signal peptides were predicted by the SignalP-5.0 Server (19 P is the fraction of residues of amino acid type i, and M is the number of amino acid types. The Shannon 104 entropy for the ith position in the alignment ranges from 0 (only one residue at that position) to 4.32 (all 105 20 residues equally represented at that position). Analysis of the entropy values which were thus 106 derived was performed using the R language. 107 108\n\nThe secondary structural prediction was conducted using the Jnet (Joint Network) program (27). Jnet is a 110 neural network-based predictor which trains neural networks from three different types of profiles: 111 profile PSSM, profile HMM, and residue frequency profile. It generates a consensus secondary structure 112 with an average accuracy of 72% or greater. 113\n\nThe Modeller9v1 program (Sali and Blundell, 1993) was utilized for homology modeling of structure of 115 SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 using the SARS-CoV ORF7 (1xak_A) (28) as a template. Since in these low sequence-116 identity cases, sequence alignment is the most important factor affecting the quality of the model 117 (Cozzetto and Tramontano, 2005) , alignments used in this study have been carefully built and cross-118 validated based on the information from HHpred and edited manually using the secondary structure 119 information. We generated five models and selected the one that had better model accuracy p-value 120\n\nand global model quality score as assessed by ModFOLD6 online server (29). Structural analysis and 121 comparison were conducted using the molecular visualization program PyMOL (30). The structural 122 similarity search was performed using the DALI server (31). 123 124\n\nThe host-pathogen arms-race has selected for a disparate complement of viral genes involved in 127 pathogenesis. These genes often rapidly diversify through recombination and mutations to keep up with 128 the evolution of host resistance. To identify proteins with potential pathogenic roles in COVID-19, we 129 conducted a comparative genomic analysis of the coronaviruses. Similarity plots show that the bat CoV 130\n\nRaTG13 is the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 with no evidence for recombination between them ( Figure  131 1 and Figure S1 ). SARS-CoV-2 also shows good similarity to two other bat viruses, CoVZXC21 and 132\n\nCoVZXC45, first in the 5' half of ORF1 and again after nucleotide number 20,000 of the genome. 133\n\nHowever, the remaining part of ORF1 of SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 show no specific relationship to these 134 viruses. This suggests a recombination event between the common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, 135 and probably another member of the SARS-related clade close to CoVZXC21 and CoVZXC45. In addition 136 to this major recombination event, we identified several smaller regions which might have undergone 137 recombinational diversification during the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome ( Figure S1 ). Notably, 138 many of them are clustered in three regions displaying extensive diversification, corresponding to the N-139 terminal region of the ORF1a polyprotein, the Spike protein, and the uncharacterized protein encoded 140 by ORF8 (Figure 1 and Figure S1 ). 141 142\n\nAmong these three fast-evolving proteins, we focused on the ORF8 protein as it is one of the so-called 144 accessory proteins, which does not participate in viral replication (32, 33), raising the possibility that it 145 might have a role in viral pathogenesis. It is a predicted secreted protein present only in some Beta-146\n\nCoVs, including SARS-CoV-2 but not the MERS-like clade. Profile-profile comparisons using a sequence-147 profile built from the multiple sequence alignment of all available ORF8 proteins showed it to be 148 unexpectedly homologous to the membrane-anchored ORF7a protein from the same subset of Beta-149\n\nCoVs, and several proteins (variously annotated as ORF9 or ORF10) from a subset of bat Alpha-CoVs 150 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.977736 doi: bioRxiv preprint terminal transmembrane (TM) helix and the acquisition of a long insert between stands 3 and 4 with a 159 conserved cysteine which might facilitate dimerization through disulfide-bond formation (Figure 2A) . 160\n\nThe homology model of ORF8, based on the structure of SARS-CoV ORF7a (pdb id:1XAK), suggests that 161 this insert augments a potential peptide-ligand binding groove that has been proposed for ORF7a 162 ( Figure 2B and Figure S3 ). Hence, the emergence of the insert has gone hand-in-hand with the 163 acquisition of a modified interaction interface. 164 165 Besides these families, we identified a fourth family of Ig domains from the same Alpha-CoVs which 166 contain the above-discussed ORF7a/8-like Ig family ( Figure 3A ). These Alpha-CoVs typically possess one 167 or two paralogous copies annotated as either ORF4a/b or NS5a/b. From their sequences, these Ig 168 domains are not closely related to the ORF7a and ORF8 Ig domains ( Figure S4 ). However, profile-profile 169 searches have shown that they are related to Ig domains found in the adenoviral E3-CR1 proteins 170 (probability: 90% of matching the Pfam CR1 Ig domain profile) ( Figure S4 ). In these searches, they also 171 yield weaker hits to two other Ig domains, namely the poxviral decoy interferon receptors and human T-172 cell surface CD3 zeta ( Figure S4 ). 173\n\nPhylogenetic analysis of ORF7a, ORF8 and Alpha-CoV Ig domains shows that each group represents a 176 distinct clade ( Figure 2C ). The tree topology of ORF7a mirrors that of the polymerase tree ( Figure 3A) ; 177 however, the topology of the ORF8-Ig clade is not consistent with it. This might be due to a 178 recombination event between the SARS-related CoVs (as suggested by the similarity plot analysis) 179 and/or unusual divergence under selection. To better understand the functional difference between 180 ORF8 and ORF7a, we examined the column-wise Shannon entropy in the 20 amino acid alphabet and 181 found that the ORF8 has significantly higher mean entropy than ORF7a (ORF8: 1.09 vs ORF7a: 0.22, p< 182 10 -16 for the H0 of congruent means by t-test) ( Figure 2D \n\nThe presence of multiple Ig domains with different affinities in CoVs prompted us to more generally 215 survey animal viruses for Ig domains. By using the Pfam models (39) and our own PSSMs created from 216 PSI-BLAST runs with Ig domains (12), we were able to identify about 17 distinct viral Ig domain families 217 in a wider diversity of animal viruses ( Figure 3B and Table S2 ). In addition to CoVs, such Ig domain 218 proteins can be found in adenoviruses, NCLDVs, Herpesviruses and Phenuiviruses. These viral Ig domains 219 are highly divergent; many of them are only found in certain viral groups. However, the majority have an While ORF8 is a paralog of ORF7a, its lack of the TM segment, unique insert and significantly more rapid 247 evolution suggest that it has acquired a distinct function and has been under strong positive selection 248\n\nOne possible mechanism is that, like the adenoviral CR1 proteins, it interferes with MHC molecules to 249 attenuate antigen presentation, resulting in ineffective detection of the virus by the host immune 250 system. Consistent with this, the SARS-CoV ortholog translocates to the ER (48) and its higher variability 251 indicates probable selection due to its interaction with a rapidly evolving host molecule.
