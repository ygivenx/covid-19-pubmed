The disease myxomatosis, caused by myxoma virus, was first recognized by in Uruguay in 1896.

Transmission from wild to domestic rabbits probably occurred via mosquitos of the genus Aedes .\n\nMyxomatosis spread to other countries of South America where it occasionally causes sporadic outbreaks in domesticated rabbits.

The disease was first recognized in North America in 1928 when natural outbreaks of a fatal disease of rabbits occurred in several rabbit colonies near San Diego, California .

The disease is endemic in the western United States, where the brush rabbit (Sylvilagus bachmani) is the natural reservoir of the virus .\n\nMyxomatosis was introduced intentionally into Australia in an effort to control what had become Australia's major animal pest, the European rabbit {Oryctolagus cuniculus). Although the virus was first introduced into Australia in 1926, for more than two decades it was used only in experimental studies aimed at determining its feasibility as a control measure for rabbits. In 1950, the virus was released into the wild rabbit population where, after a somewhat slow start, it became estab lished and spread rapidly, decimating the rabbit population of the continent by 1953. The disease is now endemic in the wild rabbit population of Australia, where it occasionally assumes epidemic proportions when climatic conditions favor vector ac tivity. Within a decade following release of myxoma virus into the rabbit population, it became evident that through a process of natural selection genetically resistant strains of rabbits had emerged.

Myxomatosis is now endemic in rabbits of the genus Sylvilagus in both South and North America and in wild rabbits of the genus Oryctolagus in South America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. b. ETIOLOGY. Myxomatosis is caused by any one of several strains of myxoma virus, a member of the genus Leporipoxvirus in the family Poxviridae (International Committee on Taxon omy of Viruses, 1991) . Antigenic differences, demonstrated among different strains of the virus Fen ner, 1965) , have prompted some to consider the California 172 public health importance~there were no reports of the spread of viruses between rabbits and humans.\n\nThe Inajor focus of this chapter is the naturally occurring viral diseases of rabbits (Tables I and II) .

In Chile, the disease is considered endemic in the wild European rabbit population . The disease was first recognized in North America in 1928 when natural outbreaks of a fatal disease of rabbits occurred in several rabbit colonies near San Diego, California . The virus which caused the first outbreaks in southern California may have been introduced into the United States from Mexico by importation of infected domestic rabbits (Vail and RONALD F. DIGIACOMO AND C. JOHN MARE McKenney, 1943) . The disease is endemic in the western United States, where the brush rabbit (Sylvilagus bachmani) is the natural reservoir of the virus (Marshall and Regnery, 1960R egnery and . Myxomatosis was introduced intentionally into Australia in an effort to control what had become Australia's major animal pest, the European rabbit (Or.vctolagus cuniculus) . Although the virus was first introduced into Australia in 1926, for more than two decades it was used only in experimental studies aiIned at determining its feasibility as a control measure for rabbits. In 1950, the virus was released into the wild rabbit population where, after a somewhat slow start, it became established and spread rapidly, decimating the rabbit population of the continent by 1953.

However, the demonstrable antigenic differ ences are insufficient to justify this distinction, and California strains of virus are discussed as strains of myxoma virus.\n\nMyxoma virus is antigenically closely related to the rabbit fibroma virus as demonstrated by agar-gel diffusion microprecipitation techniques . Heat-inactivated myxoma virus has been reactivated by fibroma virus , further demonstrating the close relation ship between these two viruses. The Berry-Dedrick phenome non of poxvirus reactivation was confirmed by , who demonstrated a spectrum of virulence for strains of myx oma and fibroma viruses. , in a study involving 92 strains of virus, established a virulence spec trum ranging from strains causing over 99% mortality in Euro pean rabbits to others causing less than 30% mortality. The most virulent strains were the Standard Laboratory, Lausanne, and California strains, whereas the least virulent were the neuromyxoma and Nottingham strains. Ecological pressures such as those previously described in Australia could have been responsible for the emergence of many of these strains of vi ruses. In many instances, however, viruses have been manipu lated in the laboratory to the point of permanent modification .\n\nThe chemical and physical characteristics of myxoma virus have been described . Myxoma virus is readily propagated at 35\u00b0C on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated hens' eggs, forming distinct pocks (Fenner and Mclntyre, 1956) . Different strains of virus cause pocks of various sizes, the variation being sufficiently distinct to allow tentative strain identification. The South American strains cause large pocks, whereas the Califor nia strains produce small focal lesions on the membrane (Fen ner and . The virus can also be propagated in cell cultures derived from rabbits and other species, including chicken, squirrel, rat, hamster, guinea pig, and human . Distinct differences in plaque size on rabbit kidney cell cultures can be demon strated between the South American and California strains, the former causing much larger plaques . The most sensitive method for isolation of myxoma vi rus under laboratory conditions is inoculation of the skin of European rabbits (Fenner and Mclntyre, 1956 ). c. EPIDEMIOLOGY. Myxomatosis is endemic on four conti nents: South America, North America, Europe, and Australia. In Brazil and Uruguay, the virus is endemic in wild rabbits of the genus Sylvilagus, particularly S. brasiliensis . A similar situation may exist in Panama and Colombia, where the strains of virus are similar in virulence to South American strains but antigenically more closely related to the California strains . In the forested area of Argen tina the virus is also endemic in Sylvilagus rabbits, but in the southern part of the country and in Chile the principal reser voir is the wild European rabbit . The California strains of myxoma virus, also known as the California rabbit fibroma virus , are en demic in wild rabbits of the genus Sylvilagus, especially 5. bachmani, which serves as the principal source of infection for domestic rabbits . In Australia, the myxoma virus has been endemic in wild European rabbits since its introduction into the rabbit population in 1950. Fol lowing the introduction of the virus into France in 1952, myx omatosis has become established in most countries of Europe, the wild European rabbit (O. cuniculus) serving as the pre dominant host species.\n\nThe naturally susceptible species are the European rabbit (O. cuniculus), the European hare (Lepus europaeus), the mountain hare {Lepus timidus), the Tapeti or tropical forest rab bit (S. brasiliensis), the brush rabbit (S. bachmani), and the eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus). Experimen tally, several additional species of Sylvilagus can be infected Regnery and Marshall, 1971) .\n\nThe principal mode of transmission of the virus is by arthro pod vectors, mosquitoes and fleas being most often incrimi nated. Because transmission occurs by mechanical transport of virus on mouth parts, the species of mosquito is unimportant, and thus any mosquito which feeds on rabbits , as well as biting flies and gnats , may serve as vectors. The source of virus is usually the super ficial layers of the skin, especially of the eyelids and at the base of the ears , where surfacefeeding arthropods such as mites and lice may obtain the virus and serve as mechanical vectors. Experimentally, virus can spread from infected to uninfected rabbits in the absence of arthropod vectors, and such contact transmission may occur under natural conditions in rabbit warrens (Mykytowycz, , 1961 . Windborne spread was suspected in France , and myxomatosis may have reached England from France in 1953 by this mode of transmission . Transmission of myxoma virus by contaminated spines of thistles (Circium vulg\u00e4re) has been described Mykytowycz, 1961) . The claws of predatory birds and carrion feeders, such as buzzards and crows, may be contaminated with virus, and such birds may play a role in dissemination of the virus .\n\nArthropod transmission of myxoma virus in its original hab itat in South America has not been investigated intensively al though circumstantial evidence indicates that mosquitoes of the genus Aedes are important vectors. Experimentally, Aedes aegypti and Aedes scapularis, as well as the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, may transmit the virus (Chappie and Lewis, 1965) . In California, it has been shown experimentally that Anopheles freeborni, Aedes serriensis, A. aegypti, Culiseta incidens, and Culex tarsalis can transmit myxoma virus between S. bachmani . The virus was isolated from wild-caught A. freeborni in an area of myxomatosis out-174 strains of virus as distinct from myxoma virus, and the designation \"California rabbit fibroma virus\" has been used to describe this virus. However, the demonstrable antigenic differences are insufficient to justify this distinction, and California strains of virus are discussed as strains of myxoma virus.\n\nMyxoma virus is antigenically closely related to the rabbit fibroma virus as demonstrated by agar-gel diffusion microprecipitation techniques .

A similar situation may exist in Panama and Colombia, where the strains of virus are similar in virulence to South American strains but antigenically more closely related to the California strains . In the forested area of Argentina the virus is also endemic in Sylvilagus rabbits, but in the RONALD F. DIGIACOMO AND C. JOHN MARE southern part of the country and in Chile the principal reservoir is the wild European rabbit . The California strains of myxoma virus, also known as the California rabbit fibroma virus , are endemic in wild rabbits of the genus Sylvilagus, especially S. bachmani, which serves as the principal source of infection for domestic rabbits (Marshall et af., 1963) . In Australia, the myxoma virus has been endemic in wild European rabbits since its introduction into the rabbit population in 1950. Following the introduction of the virus into France in 1952, myxomatosis has become established in most countries of Europe, the wild European rabbit (0. cuniculus) serving as the predominant host species.\n\nThe naturally susceptible species are the European rabbit (0. cuniculus), the European hare (Lepus europaeus), the mountain hare (Lepus timidus), the Tapeti or tropical forest rabbit (S. brasiliensis), the brush rabbit (S. bachmani), and the eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus fioridanus). Experimentally, several additional species of Sylvilagus can be infected Regnery and Marshall, 1971) .\n\nThe principal mode of transmission of the virus is by arthropod vectors, mosquitoes and fleas being most often incriminated. Because transmission occurs by mechanical transport of virus on mouth parts, the species of mosquito is unimportant, and thus any mosquito which feeds on rabbits , as well as biting flies and gnats , may serve as vectors.

The claws of predatory birds and carrion feeders, such as buzzards and crows, may be contaminated with virus, and such birds may play a role in dissemination of the virus .\n\nArthropod transmission of myxoma virus in its original habitat in South America has not been investigated intensively although circumstantial evidence indicates that mosquitoes of the genus Aedes are important vectors. Experimentally, Aedes aegypti and Aedes scapularis, as well as the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, may transmit the virus (Chapple and Lewis, 1965) . In California, it has been shown experimentally that Anopheles freeborni, Aedes serriensis, A. aegypti, Culiseta incidens, and Culex tarsalis can transmit myxoma virus between S. bachmani . The virus was isolated from wild-caught A. freeborn; in an area of myxomatosis out-breaks, further implicating it as a possible vector . In Australia, the disease spreads along river valleys, the main vector mosquitoes being Culex annulirostris, Anopheles annulipes, Culex pipiens australicus, and several Aedes species . Although black flies (Simulium spp.) are possible vectors in Australia, only Simulium melatun has been conclusively shown to be a vector . Stickfast fleas (Echidnophaga spp.) and the cat flea, C. fells, can transmit the virus, and the louse {Haemodispus ventricosus) and fur mite (Cheyletiella parasitivorax) are also vectors (Mykytowcyz, 1958) .\n\nIn an attempt to improve the usefulness of myxomatosis in rabbit control, the European rabbit flea, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, was introduced into Australia in 1966 . The flea reproduced in wild rabbit populations and trans mitted both introduced and field strains of myxoma virus (So bey and Conolly, 1971; . As a result of flea introduction, myxomatosis has become more prev alent in drier tableland areas , and out breaks of myxomatosis have shifted from summer to spring . In France, there is evidence that mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles are the principal vectors of summer epidemics. The rabbit flea, S. cuniculi, is probably a major vector, especially during winter months when mosquito activity is low (Fenner and Rat cliffe, 1965) .\n\nMyxomatosis in Britain is characterized by milder seasonal fluctuations in disease incidence than in Australia, California, and France . Mosquitoes play a minor role as vectors, whereas the rabbit flea, S. cuniculi, which is less influenced by seasonal changes, is the major vector ). The myxoma virus in Britain has not undergone the rapid loss of virulence observed with the Aus tralian and French viruses. The increase in resistance to myx omatosis in wild rabbit populations has resulted in the appearance of more virulent strains of myxoma virus . While mildly virulent strains have emerged in Britain, the predominant strains are moderately virulent (Chappie and Bowen, 1963; Chappie and Lewis, 1964; Fenner and Chappie, 1965) , with recent estimates of between 47 and 69% mortality in infected rabbits . The different evolution of myxoma virus in Britain has been attributed to the fact that the the virus is predominantly flea transmitted. The flea is less seasonal and less mobile than the mosquito. That fleas move in large numbers from dead animals while moving only occasionally from live ones would seem to favor transmission of virulent virus strains . The proportion of infective fleas produced is inversely related to the survival time of rabbits following infec tion . The flea is also an ef fective reservoir of virus, possessing a longer life span than mosquitoes. The life span of active female mosquitoes is usu ally 2-3 weeks, whereas fleas have been known to feed actively for over 1 year. The myxoma virus can persist for 105 days in rabbit fleas with no rabbit contact in artificial burrows (Chappie and Lewis, 1965 . In the brush rabbit (S. bachmani), skin tumors, rarely more than 1 cm in diameter, develop at the base of one or both ears . Experi mental inoculation of S. bachmani with the South American and California strains results in development of local skin tu mors, with the South American virus causing slightly more prominent tumors than the California virus (Marshall and Reg nery, 1963) . Cottontail rabbits (S. floridanus, Sylvilagus nuttalli, and Sylvilagus auduboni) develop small lesions at the site of California virus inoculation, but in S. nuttalli and S. auduboni the South American virus induces a larger lesion .\n\nii. Signs in Lepus Species. The European hare (L. europaeus) is resistant to the myxoma virus under experimental conditions, and field experience supports this observation. Oc casionally, however, individual hares (L. europaeus and L. timidus) with mild to severe generalized myxomatosis have been encountered .\n\niii. Signs in Oryctolagus cuniculus. Myxoma virus infec tion in the European rabbit usually results in severe disease with high mortality . The severity of clinical disease is largely determined by the strain of virus as well as the strain of rabbit . The varieties of clinical syndromes which can result from infection with various strains of virus in various strains of rabbits have been described in detail . The discussion which follows is a summation of the findings of these workers and others Chappie and Bowen, 1963) .\n\nSigns which develop following infection with California strains of the virus in susceptible rabbits vary depending on the length of time the rabbit survives. Rabbits with the peracute form of disease die within 1 week after exposure to the virus, 9. VIRAL DISEASES breaks, further implicating it as a possible vector .

The rabbit flea, S. cuniculi, is probably a major vector, especially during winter months when mosquito activity is low .\n\nMyxomatosis in Britain is characterized by milder seasonal fluctuations in disease incidence than in Australia, California, and France . Mosquitoes playa minor role as vectors, whereas the rabbit flea, S. cuniculi, which is less influenced by seasonal changes, is the major vector Andrewes et ai., 1959; ).

The increase in resistance to myxomatosis in wild rabbit populations has resulted in the appearance of more virulent strains of myxoma virus .

Signs in Lepus Species. The European hare (L. europaeus) is resistant to the myxoma virus under experimental conditions, and field experience supports this observation. Occasionally, however, individual hares (L. europaeus and L. timidus) with mild to severe generalized myxomatosis have been encountered .\n\niii. Signs in Oryctolagus cuniculus. Myxoma virus infection in the European rabbit usually results in severe disease with high mortality . The severity of clinical disease is largely determined by the strain of virus as well as the strain of rabbit . The varieties of clinical syndromes which can result from infection with various strains of virus in various strains of rabbits have been described in detail . The discussion which follows is a summation of the findings of these workers and others (Kessel et ai., 1931; Chapple and Bowen, 1963) .\n\nSigns which develop following infection with California strains of the virus in susceptible rabbits vary depending on the length of time the rabbit survives. Rabbits with the peracute form of disease die within I week after exposure to the virus, exhibiting only edema of the eyelids and lethargy prior to death. In the acute form of disease, in which rabbits survive for 1 to 2 weeks, usually edema of the eyelids, resulting in a \"droopy\" appearance of the eyes, appears at 6 to 7 days. Inflammation and edema around the anal, genital, oral, and nasal orifices are also observed. Skin hemorrhages and convulsions precede death on the ninth or tenth day. The few rabbits which survive beyond 10 days may develop purulent blepharoconjunctivitis and edema at the base of the ears, signs more often associated with other myxoma strains. The nodule which develops at the site of inoculation is not a clearly defined tumor, and under natural conditions the development of myxomas is not charac teristic. Although nodules on the ears, head, and legs have been reported , other workers have been unable to induce nodule development .\n\nThe acute disease, which follows inoculation of rabbits with the original South American isolate of , results in a mean survival time of 11 days. From 3 to 4 days following inoculation or natural infection with virus, a primary tumor may become evident, and generalized tumors usually appear by the sixth or seventh day. Edema of the eyelids occurs followed by mucopurulent blepharoconjunctivitis, often resulting in com plete closure of the eyes (Fig. 1) . Mucopurulent nasal discharge and pronounced edema of the base of the ears, the perineal region, the external genitalia, and lips are frequently seen. By the tenth day, hard convex lumps may cover the body, head, and ears and occasionally the legs. The lumps are not sharply demarcated but may become markedly congested and ulti mately necrotic in rabbits surviving for 2 weeks. Dyspnea is often seen in protracted cases, but appetite may be maintained until shortly before death. Terminal convulsions frequently pre cede death, which usually occurs 8 to 15 days after infection. Infection with the less virulent South American and Australian strains results in milder disease with less edema and nasal and ocular discharge, more clearly demarcated nodules, and lower mortality. The laboratory-attenuated neuromyxoma virus in duces a mild disease with little or no mortality .\n\nThe predominant myxoma strains in Europe are the virulent Lausanne strain and its naturally attenuated derivatives origi nating from the virus introduced into France from Brazil in 1952. The more virulent European viruses cause severe disease in rabbits, resulting in mortality of up to 100%, but modified strains which have emerged are of lower morbidity and mortal ity . With some of the naturally atten uated British viruses, mortality is also decreased, and tumors are flat rather than convex, resembling some of the attenuated field strains in Australia (Chappie and Bowen, 1963) . e. PATHOLOGY. The gross and microscopic pathology of myxomatosis has been comprehensively reviewed . In adult Sylvilagus, myxoma virus usually causes localized skin tumors. The tumors resemble the fibromas in European rabbits pro duced by the rabbit fibroma virus (see later). Hares or young Sylvilagus usually develop a mild localized infection, although disseminated cutaneous fibromatous to myxomatous nodules similar to those in acute myxomatosis may be found. Prominent gross lesions in European rabbits with myxomatosis are skin tumors (not characteristic of the California disease) and pro nounced cutaneous and subcutaneous edema, especially of the face and around body orifices (Fig. 2) . Hemorrhages of the skin, heart, and subserosa of the gastrointestinal tract may be ob served, especially following infection with the California virus.\n\nLesions in the skin involve epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells and range from proliferative to degenerative, 176 exhibiting only edema of the eyelids and lethargy prior to death. In the acute form of disease, in which rabbits survive for I to 2 weeks, usually edema of the eyelids, resulting in a \"droopy\" appearance of the eyes, appears at 6 to 7 days. Inflammation and edema around the anal, genital, oral, and nasal orifices are also observed. Skin hemorrhages and convulsions precede death on the ninth or tenth day. The few rabbits which survive beyond 10 days may develop purulent blepharoconjunctivitis and edema at the base of the ears, signs more often associated with other myxoma strains. The nodule which develops at the site of inoculation is not a clearly defined tumor, and under natural conditions the development of myxomas is not characteristic. Although nodules on the ears, head, and legs have been reported (Kessel et aI., 1934) , other workers have been unable to induce nodule development .\n\nThe acute disease, which follows inoculation of rabbits with the original South American isolate of , results in a mean survival time of II days. From 3 to 4 days following inoculation or natural infection with virus, a primary tumor may become evident, and generalized tumors usually appear by the sixth or seventh day. Edema of the eyelids occurs followed by mucopurulent blepharoconjunctivitis, often resulting in complete closure of the eyes (Fig. I) . Mucopurulent nasal discharge and pronounced edema of the base of the ears, the perineal region, the external genitalia, and lips are frequently seen. By the tenth day, hard convex lumps may cover the body, head, and ears and occasionally the legs. The lumps are not sharply demarcated but may become markedly congested and ultimately necrotic in rabbits surviving for 2 weeks. Dyspnea is often seen in protracted cases, but appetite may be maintained until shortly before death. Terminal convulsions frequently precede death, which usually occurs 8 to 15 days after infection. Infection with the less virulent South American and Australian strains results in milder disease with less edema and nasal and ocular discharge, more clearly demarcated nodules, and lower mortality. The laboratory-attenuated neuromyxoma virus induces a mild disease with little or no mortality .\n\nThe predominant myxoma strains in Europe are the virulent Lausanne strain and its naturally attenuated derivatives originating from the virus introduced into France from Brazil in 1952. The more virulent European viruses cause severe disease in rabbits, resulting in mortality of up to 100%, but modified strains which have emerged are of lower morbidity and mortality . With some of the naturally attenuated British viruses, mortality is also decreased, and tumors are flat rather than convex, resembling some of the attenuated field strains in Australia (Chapple and Bowen, 1963) . e. PATHOLOGY. The gross and microscopic pathology of myxomatosis has been comprehensively reviewed . In adult Sylvilagus, myxoma virus usually causes localized skin tumors.

Prominent gross lesions in European rabbits with myxomatosis are skin tumors (not characteristic of the California disease) and pronounced cutaneous and subcutaneous edema, especially of the face and around body orifices (Fig. 2) . Hemorrhages of the skin, heart, and subserosa of the gastrointestinal tract may be observed, especially following infection with the California virus.\n\nLesions in the skin involve epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells and range from proliferative to degenerative, depending on the strain of virus. The skin tumors result from proliferation of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells, which be come large stellate (myxoma) cells surrounded by a homoge neous matrix of mucinous material interspersed with capillaries and inflammatory cells (Figs. 3 and 4) . It is because of this mucinous substance that the tumors are referred to as myxomas and the disease myxomatosis. Vascular endothelial proliferation with narrowing of the lumen and extrusion of stellate cells has been described by , who considered this lesion characteristic of myxomatosis. Central necrosis of myxomas may be attributed to occlusion of blood vessels by endothelial proliferation. Epithelial cells overlying the tumor may appear normal in early tumors, or show hyperplasia or degeneration. Intracytoplasmic inclusions, in various cells types, are espe cially prominent in the basal layer of the skin .\n\nLesions in other organs, although not consistently present, reflect the generalized nature of myxomatosis. Cellular prolif eration, invariably present in the skin, has also been described in pulmonary alveolar epithelium and in reticulum cells of lymph nodes and spleen . Focal hemorrhages may be observed in skin, kidneys, lymph nodes, testes, heart, stomach, and intestines. Degeneration and necrosis occur fre quently in lymph nodes, pulmonary alveoli, spleen, and central veins of hepatic lobules. Stellate cells may occur in lymph nodes, bone marrow, uterus, ovaries, testes, and lungs .\n\nf. DIAGNOSIS. Myxomatosis in European rabbits can usu ally be diagnosed by the clinicopathological features. Infection with the California viruses may be harder to diagnose, however, owing to the frequent absence of skin nodules and other signs of disease. Diagnosis should be confirmed by virus isolation. The technique of choice is intracutaneous inoculation of young susceptible rabbits with fresh tissue collected from lesions free of bacterial contamination. Lesions should develop at the site of inoculation within 1 week. The virus can be isolated by chorioallantoic membrane inoculation of 11-to 13-day-old embryonated chicken eggs followed by incubation at 35\u00b0C for 4 to 6 days. Distinct focal pocks develop if the virus is present. The South American viruses cause large pocks, the California virus intermediate sized pocks, and the fibroma virus minute pocks. Virus isolation on chicken embryo fibroblast cell cultures or any one of several cell types can also be accomplished. The virus isolated can be identified as myxoma virus by a direct fluorescent antibody test , the plaque-neutralization test , or the agar-gel diffusion microprecipitation test . Infec tion of Sylvilagus rabbits with myxoma virus clinically resem bles fibromatosis and should be differentiated from the latter disease by inoculation of young susceptible rabbits of the genus Oryctolagus. Myxomatosis causes severe to fatal disease, whereas fibromatosis causes a localized fibroma. g. CONTROL. Control of myxomatosis is of prime impor tance in areas where the virus is endemic in wild rabbit popu lations. In such areas, vector control, including adequate screen ing to exclude mosquitoes, serves to keep the disease under control. Newly introduced rabbits should be quarantined in an insect-proof facility for 2 weeks. To prevent spread within a colony, all sick rabbits should be isolated. Fibroma virus has been used as a live vaccine for myxomatosis, but results have been variable .

HISTORY. The transmissible tumor-inducing agent now known as rabbit or Shope fibroma virus was isolated from a cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagusfloridanus) in 1932 . The virus was transmissible to cottontail and European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), producing localized fibromas in both species. Shope (1932a) described the gross and microscopic lesions of both the natural and experimental disease and identi fied the causative agent as a virus . He showed that it was antigenically related to myxoma virus. Similarities between fibroma and myxoma viruses have subsequently been confirmed by cross-immunity tests , ether sensi tivity , virusreactivation studies , and microprecipitation procedures . The fibroma virus, initially believed to cause only localized benign fibromas, was later shown to cause severe generalized disease in newborn Eur opean ) and cottontail rabbits . The disease is historically considered a benign endemic disease of wild cottontail rabbits, of little economic significance to commercial rabbit producers or laboratory investigators. However, an epidemic of fibromatosis in a commercial rabbitry resulting in high morbidity and mortality in newborn rabbits was reported in 1971 . Thus, the disease can be a threat to commercial rabbits in areas where it is endemic in wild rabbit populations and outdoor husbandry practices permit contact with arthropod vectors.\n\nAnother tumor-producing virus, designated malignant rabbit fibroma virus, has been recovered from rabbits (O. cuniculus) with experimentally induced Shope fibromas . Although the virus was present in a stock of fibroma virus, its origin is unclear. The virus is antigenically similar to both fibroma and myxoma viruses and is considered a recombinant of the two viruses . The virus induces a syndrome of severe immunosuppression resulting in dissemi nated malignancy and opportunistic infections (Strayer et al, 1983a-c; Corbeil etal, 1983; . The disease may be a useful model for the study of virus-induced immunologic impairment (Strayer etal, 1985) .\n\nb. ETIOLOGY. The fibroma virus is a Leporipoxvirus of the family Poxviridae (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 1991) and is closely related to myxoma virus and the hare and squirrel fibroma viruses . The chemical and physical characteristics of fibroma vi rus have been summarized by . The virus can be propagated on the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken em bryos, but characteristic lesions as observed with myxoma virus are not produced . The virus has been propagated in cell cultures derived from rats, guinea pigs, and humans and also in rabbit cell cul tures derived from cottontail and domestic rabbits . Fibroma virus in cultured rabbit kidney cells induces pronounced changes in cell growth and morphology, and inoculation of virus-transformed cells into the cheek pouch of hamsters results in tumor formation . c. EPIDEMIOLOGY. Since rabbit fibroma virus was first iso lated from a cottontail rabbit in New Jersey , the disease has been recognized in several other states, as well as in Canada. Herman etal. (1956) found that more than 50% of wild cottontail rabbits trapped in the Patuxent Wildlife Refuge in Maryland had fibroma virus or antibodies to fibroma virus. The virus has also been isolated from cottontail rabbits in Wisconsin , Michigan , and Ohio . Recognition of the disease in Texas indicates that it may be more widespread than was formerly believed.\n\nThe natural transmission cycle of fibroma virus has not been completely elucidated. The virus may persist in the epidermis of experimentally infected cottontail rabbits for 5 to 10 months , which would enhance the likelihood of mechanical arthropod trans mission. Experimentally, several species of mosquitoes as well as triatomes, fleas, and bedbugs can serve as vectors . Infected mosquitoes are capable of infecting wild cottontail rab bits . Experimental and circumstan tial evidence suggests that the principal mode of transmission for fibroma virus is biting arthropods, a situation similar to that described for myxomatosis.\n\nThe natural host of fibroma virus is the eastern cottontail rab bit (S. floridanus). Three other species of Sylvilagus (S. bachmani, S. nuttalli, and S. auduboni) are refractory to fibroma virus . A closely related virus, iso lated from fibromas in S. bachmani, failed to induce lesions in other Sylvilagus species . This virus, considered a strain of myxoma virus, is a related virus named California rabbit fibroma virus . The European rabbit is susceptible to fibroma virus as is the snowshoe hare, Lepus americanus , but the European hare, Lepus europaeus, is refractory to the virus . Whereas the European rabbit is readily infected, it does not serve as a good source of infection for mosquitoes because of low virus concentrations in the skin . 178 virulent for use as a vaccine and further attenuated it by serial passage in rabbit kidney cell cultures.

The clinical signs are largely those de scribed by Shope ( ,b, 1936 . The tumors observed in nat ural fibromatosis of eastern cottontail rabbits are almost invariably on the legs or feet, usually one to three tumors oc curring on an infected rabbit. Tumors may occur on the muzzle and around the eyes, and they measure up to 7 cm in diameter and 1-2 cm in thickness. The tumors are subcutaneous, un attached to underlying tissues, and may persist for several months, and in some instances for nearly a year . Other clinical signs are usually absent, the tumorbearing rabbit remaining apparently normal throughout the dis ease. Metastases do not occur .\n\nThe clinical signs in experimentally infected European rab bits resemble those in cottontail rabbits. However, regression of tumors is usually more rapid than in cottontail rabbits. Inocula tion of newborn European rabbits frequently results in fatal systemic infections . Systemic infections of adult European rabbits have also been described , but the usual result of infection is the development of localized benign tumors. In the only reported natural outbreak of fibromatosis of European rabbits, diffuse subcutaneous in duration involving the underlying tissues occurred . Subcutaneous tumors (Fig. 5) were the predominant sign in adult rabbits, but suckling rabbits had lethargy and loss of condition, in addition to the skin lesions. Hyperemia and edema of the external genitalia of male and female rabbits were also observed. An isolated case in which a small mass developed on the cornea of a European rabbit has been reported .\n\ne. PATHOLOGY. The gross and microscopic changes asso ciated with fibroma virus infection in naturally and experimen tally infected cottontail rabbits and in experimentally infected European rabbits have been described by several workers . The pathological changes in the only reported natural outbreak of fibromatosis in European rabbits were de scribed by . The earliest gross lesion in ex perimentally infected cottontail rabbits is a slight thickening of the subcutaneous tissue, followed by development of clearly demarcated soft swellings usually evident 6 days after inocula tion. The tumors enlarge, increase in density, and usually reach maximum size by 12 days. The average size of the tumors is 4-6 cm with a thickness of 2 cm. Tumors may persist for months before regressing, leaving the rabbit essentially normal. Experimentally infected newborn cottontail rabbits may die of generalized fibromatosis. Under natural conditions, however, this form of the disease has not been observed. Gross lesions in experimentally infected European rabbits are similar to those observed in cottontail rabbits, but regression of the tumors oc curs more rapidly.\n\nThe earliest microscopic lesions in cottontail rabbits are an acute inflammation followed by localized fibroblastic prolifer ation, accompanied by both mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltrations. Fibroblasts proliferate until a distinct tumor is formed, consisting of spindle-shaped and polygonal connective tissue cells with abundant cytoplasm. Mitotic figures are few. Many tumor cells may have large intracytoplasmic inclusions characteristic of poxvirus infections. Mononuclear leukocyte cuffing of vessels adjacent to the tumor may be observed, and a pronounced accumulation of lympho cytes at the base of the tumor is often seen. Degeneration of the overlying epidermis may result from pressure ischemia, fol lowed by necrosis and sloughing of the epithelium and tumor. In many instances, however, the tumors regress without epithe lial sloughing. Regression is usually complete within 2 months after appearance of tumors. Andrewes (1936) described a strain of fibroma virus which caused a more inflammatory and less proliferative lesion than the fibroma virus isolated by .\n\nHistologically, typical fibromas are observed in European rabbits experimentally infected with fibroma virus. The lesions differ only slightly from those in cottontail rabbits, the principal difference being the absence of epidermal degeneration often observed in the latter species . However, Ahl strom (1938) described epidermal degeneration in European rabbits. Microscopic lesions in the natural outbreak of fibro matosis in European rabbits ranged from tumors resembling myxomas ( Fig. 6 ) to typical fibromas . Eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions were occasionally observed in tumor cells, and similar inclusions, possibly of viral origin, were seen in epithelial cells overlying the tumors. The lesions encountered in adult and newborn rabbits did not differ significantly.\n\nf. DIAGNOSIS. Fibromatosis should be differentiated from papillomatosis and myxomatosis. Clinically, differentiation from papillomatosis should be readily accomplished. Fibromas are essentially flat, subcutaneous, loose, rubbery tumors, whereas 9. VIRAL DISEASES d. CLINICAL SIGNS.

Eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions were occasionally observed in tumor cells, and similar inclusions, possibly of viral origin, were seen in epithelial cells overlying the tumors. The lesions encountered in adult and newborn rabbits did not differ significantly.\n\nf. DIAGNOSIS. Fibromatosis should be differentiated from papillomatosis and myxomatosis. Clinically, differentiation from papillomatosis should be readily accomplished. Fibromas are essentially flat, subcutaneous, loose, rubbery tumors, whereas papillomas are tumors of the skin which are heavily keratinized and project in irregular fashion from the skin surface. Histopathological differentiation is also easily accomplished, espe cially when fibroma inclusions are observed. Myxomatosis in cottontail rabbits may resemble fibromatosis but is differenti ated by subcutaneous inoculation of young European rabbits with a tumor cell suspension. Fibroma virus induces local fibromas, whereas myxoma virus causes severe systemic and often fatal disease. Virus isolation in cell cultures or on the chorioallantoic membranes of chicken embryos should be attempted to confirm the diagnosis. The virus can be identified by serumneutralization tests .\n\ng. CONTROL. Because the disease is endemic and of little significance in cottontail rabbits, no control measures have been developed. Fibromatosis is also not an important problem in domestic rabbits; however, since the disease has been encoun tered in a rabbitry in an area where the disease is apparently endemic in wild rabbits, control measures might be considered. In such areas, the method of choice for preventing infection of rabbits held in outdoor enclosures is vector control. Careful analysis of the role of possible vectors in natural outbreaks should be made in preparation for the establishment of vector control methods.\n\na. HISTORY. Epidemics of a fibromatous disease in Euro pean hares (Lepus europaeus) occurred in France and Northern Italy in 1959 (Leinati et \u03b1\u03af, 1959; Lafenetre et \u03b1\u03af, 1960) . The causative agent was a poxvirus related to myxoma virus (Leinati et \u03b1\u03af, 1961) . In retrospect, a nodular skin disease of hares in Germany designated hare sarcoma was probably hare fibroma tosis (D\u00fcngern and Coca, 1909) . b. ETIOLOGY. The causative agent of hare fibromatosis is a Leporipoxvirus in the family Poxviridae (International Com mittee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 1991), which has been shown by plaque-neutralization and cross-protection tests to be antigenically related to myxoma, rabbit fibroma, and squirrel fi broma viruses . Agar-gel diffu sion microprecipitation techniques reveal that hare fibroma virus shares more common antigens with rabbit fibroma virus than with myxoma virus . A considerable degree of cross-protection exists between hare fibroma and myxoma viruses. European rabbits immune to myxoma virus are com pletely refractory to hare fibroma virus, whereas rabbits immu nized with hare fibroma virus develop signs when infected with myxoma virus but do survive, indicating some protection . c. EPIDEMIOLOGY. Hare fibromatosis has been recognized only in Europe, where under natural conditions it infects the European hare. The European rabbit {Oryctolagus cuniculus) is susceptible to the virus, but natural outbreaks of disease in rab bits have not been reported. A seasonal occurrence of disease has been reported, with the peak incidence in late summer and autumn (Leinati et \u03b1\u03af, 1959; Lafenetre et \u03b1\u03af, 1960) . The mode of transmission and interepidemic survival of the virus are unknown.\n\nd. CLINICAL SIGNS. In European hares, the disease is char acterized by development of numerous skin nodules, up to 2.5 cm in size, occurring especially on the face, eyelids, and around the ears. The nodules closely resemble rabbit fibromas . In adult European rabbits the virus causes formation of small fibromas, but newborn rabbits exhibit large fibromas resembling the lesions of rabbit fibromatosis ). e. PATHOLOGY. The gross and microscopic appearance of the lesions of hare fibroma is similar to that of the lesions of rabbit fibroma (Lafenetre et \u03b1\u03af, 1960; Leinati et \u03b1\u03af, 1961) .\n\nf. DIAGNOSIS. The disease is usually diagnosed from clinicopathological features. The diagnosis can be confirmed by virus isolation in rabbit kidney cell cultures or on the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryos. Serological characteri zation of the virus can be achieved using the agar-gel diffusion technique . g. CONTROL. Because the disease is endemic and of little significance in hares, no control measures have been developed.\n\na. HISTORY. Rabbitpox was first diagnosed at the Rocke feller Institute in New York when a highly fatal disease oc curred spontaneously in the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) colony in 1932 . A smaller outbreak had occurred in 1930. papillomas are tumors of the skin which are heavily keratinized and project in irregular fashion from the skin surface. Histopathological differentiation is also easily accomplished, especially when fibroma inclusions are observed. Myxomatosis in cottontail rabbits may resemble fibromatosis but is differentiated by subcutaneous inoculation of young European rabbits with a tumor cell suspension. Fibroma virus induces local fibromas, whereas myxoma virus causes severe systemic and often fatal disease. Virus isolation in cell cultures or on the chorioallantoic membranes of chicken embryos should be attempted to confirm the diagnosis. The virus can be identified by serumneutralization tests .\n\ng. CONTROL. Because the disease is endemic and of little significance in cottontail rabbits, no control measures have been developed. Fibromatosis is also not an important problem in domestic rabbits; however, since the disease has been encountered in a rabbitry in an area where the disease is apparently endemic in wild rabbits, control measures might be considered. In such areas, the method of choice for preventing infection of rabbits held in outdoor enclosures is vector control. Careful analysis of the role of possible vectors in natural outbreaks should be made in preparation for the establishment of vector control methods.\n\n3. Hare Fibroma Virus a. HISTORY. Epidemics of a fibromatous disease in European hares (Lepus europaeus) occurred in France and Northern Italy in 1959 . The causative agent was a poxvirus related to myxoma virus . In retrospect, a nodular skin disease of hares in Germany designated hare sarcoma was probably hare fibromatosis (Dungern and Coca, 1909) . RONALD F. DIGIACOMO AND C. JOHN MARE b. ETIOLOGY. The causative agent of hare fibromatosis is a Leporipoxvirus in the family Poxviridae (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 1991), which has been shown by plaque-neutralization and cross-protection tests to be anti-genicalIy related to myxoma, rabbit fibroma, and squirrel fibroma viruses . Agar-gel diffusion microprecipitation techniques reveal that hare fibroma virus shares more common antigens with rabbit fibroma virus than with myxoma virus . A considerable degree of cross-protection exists between hare fibroma and myxoma viruses. European rabbits immune to myxoma virus are completely refractory to hare fibroma virus, whereas rabbits immunized with hare fibroma virus develop signs when infected with myxoma virus but do survive, indicating some protection . c. EPIDEMIOLOGY. Hare fibromatosis has been recognized only in Europe, where under natural conditions it infects the European hare. The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is susceptible to the virus, but natural outbreaks of disease in rabbits have not been reported. A seasonal occurrence of disease has been reported, with the peak incidence in late summer and autumn (Leinati et aI., 1959; . The mode of transmission and interepidemic survival of the virus are unknown.\n\nd. CLINICAL SIGNS. In European hares, the disease is characterized by development of numerous skin nodules, up to 2.5 cm in size, occurring especially on the face, eyelids, and around the ears. The nodules closely resemble rabbit fibromas (Leinati et aI., 1961) . In adult European rabbits the virus causes formation of small fibromas, but newborn rabbits exhibit large fibromas resembling the lesions of rabbit fibromatosis ). e. PATHOLOGY. The gross and microscopic appearance of the lesions of hare fibroma is similar to that of the lesions of rabbit fibroma .\n\nf. DIAGNOSIS. The disease is usually diagnosed from clinicopathological features. The diagnosis can be confirmed by virus isolation in rabbit kidney cell cultures or on the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryos. Serological characterization of the virus can be achieved using the agar-gel diffusion technique . g. CONTROL. Because the disease is endemic and of little significance in hares, no control measures have been developed. 4. Rabbitpox a. HISTORY. Rabbitpox was first diagnosed at the Rockefeller Institute in New York when a highly fatal disease occurred spontaneously in the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) colony in 1932 Pearce et aI., 1933; . A smaller outbreak had occurred in 1930.\n\nRabbits developed an erythematous rash followed by cutaneous eruptions closely resembling the pocks seen in human infection with variola virus (smallpox). The disease was extremely con tagious and caused high mortality, especially in young rabbits and pregnant females. Belgian hares were also susceptible to the disease. The causative agent of the disease was a poxvirus .\n\nA spontaneous outbreak of a similar disease in a laboratory rabbit colony in Holland was described by . The disease was highly fatal and differed from the Rockefeller out break in that it was not exanthematous, giving rise to the name pockless rabbitpox . This disease was also caused by a poxvirus closely related to vaccinia virus . A second outbreak of the disease in Holland was reported by . The second epidemic of rabbit pox reported in the United States occurred in New York and was also of the pockless type first observed by in Holland. Another serious epi demic of the disease, resulting in mortality of 95%, occurred following the introduction of supposedly inactivated rabbitpox virus of the Dutch (Utrecht) strain into the rabbit colony of a medical school . Various aspects of the infection have been reviewed by .\n\nb. ETIOLOGY. Rabbitpox virus is an Orthopoxvirus in the family Poxviridae (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 1991) and is antigenically related to vaccinia virus . The biological prop erties of the Utrecht and Rockefeller strains of rabbitpox viruses are indistinguishable from certain neurovaccinia strains . The close antigenic relationship between rabbitpox virus and vaccinia virus, taken together with the fact that all reported outbreaks of rabbitpox have occurred in laboratory colonies, suggests that rabbitpox may be a laboratory variant of vaccinia virus . Wittek etal. (1977) used genome mapping to show that rabbitpox virus (Utrecht strain) was a strain of vaccinia virus. Rabbitpox virus can be propagated on the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryos with development of distinct pocks. The predominant pock type is hemorrhagic , but white pock mu tants have been described . Rabbitpox virus has been propagated in several cell lines, including HeLa, Chang Liver, L929 (mouse fibroblast), human heart, KB (human epithelial), FL (human amnion), AT (Chinese hamster epithelial), PK-2A (pig kidney), and FAF cells (Chinese hamster fibroblast) . The Rockefeller strain of rabbitpox virus hemagglutinates chicken erythrocytes, but the Utrecht strain and the strain isolated from the first American outbreak of pockless rabbitpox do not .\n\nc. EPIDEMIOLOGY. Rabbitpox is relatively rare, and all re ported outbreaks have occurred in laboratory colonies in the United States and Holland. The highest mortality occurs in young rabbits and pregnant or lactating females . Differences in susceptibility by rabbit breed also occur . Within infected colonies, the spread of disease is extremely rapid, and, in the outbreak of 1932, removal and isolation of infected rabbits failed to prevent the disease from spreading throughout the colony . The virus appears to spread via nasal discharges, which usually appear on the third day after infection. Airborne droplets may be inhaled or ingested by susceptible rabbits . Recovery from infection does not appear to result in establishment of a carrier state, as recovered rabbits can be safely mated with susceptible rabbits and clean colonies derived from recovered stock ). Arthropods have not been shown to play a role in the epidemiology of rabbitpox infection. In general, the primary sources of infection resulting in outbreaks of disease have not been determined, although the origin may have been rabbits inoculated with vaccinia virus .\n\nd. CLINICAL SIGNS. The clinical disease has been described in detail Chris tensen et al, 1967) . The virus initially infects and multiplies in the nasal mucosa and later in lymph nodes of the respiratory tract and in the lungs and spleen. Fever and a profuse nasal discharge usually occur 2 to 3 days after infection. Another early sign is enlargement and induration of the lymph nodes, especially the popliteal and inguinal nodes, which usually per sist throughout the course of disease. Widely distributed skin lesions usually appear about 5 days after infection, initially as an erythematous macular rash which becomes papular and may progress to nodules up to 1 cm in size. These nodules eventually form dry, superficial crusts. Macules and papules may also oc cur on the mucous membranes of the oral and nasal cavities. Extensive edema of the face and oral cavity is often observed, as is focal necrosis of the hard palate and the gums. Hemor rhages in the skin may occur in severe cases.\n\nMale rabbits frequently develop severe orchitis with exten sive scrotal edema, and papules in the prepuce and urethra are observed. Similar lesions may also occur in the vulvae of fe males. If edema is extensive, urine retention may occur in either sex. Pregnant females usually abort. The eyes are almost invari ably affected and exhibit blepharitis, purulent conjunctivitis, and acute keratitis with corneal ulceration. Death usually occurs 7 to 10 days after infection but may occur as early as 5 days, or rabbits may survive for several weeks before dying. The generalized disease syndrome described above repre sents the findings of and Bedson and Duck worth (1963) with the Rockefeller strain of virus. This strain may occasionally result in peracute disease in which death is preceded only by fever, anorexia, and occasionally blepharitis. The peracute form is unusual with the Rockefeller strain, but natural outbreaks of rabbitpox of the pockless type , without erythema or skin lesions, have occurred. In the first Dutch outbreak, some 9.

In the first Dutch outbreak, some rabbits died within 1 week after infection, with only anorexia, fever, and lethargy . In the first American out break of pockless disease, rabbits developed conjunctivitis and diarrhea and died 7 to 9 days after experimental infection . and described the occasional presence of scattered papules on the lips and tongues of rabbits with pockless rabbitpox. Experimentally, both the Utrecht and Rockefeller strains of virus produce skin lesions . e. PATHOLOGY. The gross and microscopic pathology of rabbitpox has been described in detail by for the Rockefeller Institute outbreak and by for the first outbreak of pockless rabbitpox in the United States. The most distinctive gross lesions are the skin lesions, which may range in severity from a few localized papules to severe, almost confluent skin lesions with extensive necrosis and hemorrhage. Nodules occur in the mouth, upper respiratory tract, spleen, liver, and lungs but may also occur in almost any part of the body. Subcutaneous edema and edema of the mouth and other body orifices are common. Only rabbits with severe lesions of the mouth are emaciated at necropsy.\n\nThe liver is enlarged, yellowish, and has numerous small, gray nodules. Focal areas of hepatic necrosis may be seen. Small nodules may also occur in the gallbladder. The spleen is usually moderately enlarged with occasional focal nodules or areas of focal necrosis. Scattered diffusely throughout the lungs may be small white nodules and, in advanced cases, focal areas of necrosis. The testicles, ovaries, and uterus frequently exhibit diffuse white nodules and marked edema. Necrosis of the testes occurs frequently, and the uterus may contain focal abscesses. Focal nodules may be present in lymph nodes, adrenal glands, thyroid glands, parathyroid glands, peritoneum, omentum, and, rarely, the heart. Specific gross lesions are seldom observed in the central nervous system or kidneys. In the pockless form of the disease, a few pocks may be found in the mouth, and occa sional skin lesions may be revealed by shaving the rabbit. The prominent gross lesions at necropsy are pleuritis, multifocal hepatic necrosis, splenomegaly, and edema and hemorrhage of the testes. The small white nodules, abundant in the more typi cal form of the disease, occur occasionally in the lungs and adrenal glands.\n\nThe predominant histological lesion in rabbitpox is the pap ule or nodule which occurs in the skin and many other organs. A typical nodule consists of a central zone of necrosis, sur rounded by mononuclear cells. Adjacent tissues are frequently edematous and occasionally hemorrhagic. Diffuse lesions with massive mononuclear cell infiltration, necrosis, hemorrhage, and edema often occur. Vesicles and pustules, as with human variola infection, are not characteristic of rabbitpox infection. Vascular occlusion from the pronounced swelling of the endothelium may result in necrotic lesions.\n\nFocal nodular lesions and diffuse pneumonitis, with perivascular mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cell infiltration, oc cur in the lungs. Focal to diffuse pulmonary necrosis may be found. There is severe congestion of the spleen, with marked distension of sinuses by mononuclear cells, edema of Malpighian corpuscles, and focal to diffuse necrosis. Lymph nodes are generally greatly enlarged, mainly from severe edema. Exten sive necrosis of lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissues such as Peyer's patches may occur. Hemorrhage and necrosis of the bone marrow occur frequently, interspersed with areas of mono nuclear cell infiltration. Degeneration and necrosis of hepatic parenchyma may be focal or diffuse and may involve the whole organ. Focal necrosis with edema is detected in the testes, as are necrotic foci in the adrenal glands, uterus, thyroid glands, thymus, and salivary glands. The characteristic cytoplasmic in clusions associated with poxvirus infections are seldom en countered in rabbitpox.\n\nf. DIAGNOSIS. Rabbitpox can be diagnosed by the clinical signs and the characteristic gross and microscopic lesions. Con firmatory diagnosis can be made by detection of viral antigen in tissues by fluorescent antibody or tissue impression smears or by virus isolation and identifica tion. The virus can be isolated by chorioallantoic membrane inoculation of chicken embryos or by cell culture propagation of the virus on cells derived from rabbits, mice, or any of sev eral animal species . The virus may be identified by the fluorescent antibody procedure, hemagglutination inhibition (some strains), or cross-protection tests using vaccinia-immunized and susceptible rabbits. Vacciniaimmunized rabbits should be resistant, whereas severe disease with high mortality should occur in susceptible rabbits. g. CONTROL. Because the natural source of virus causing outbreaks has not been determined, control measures to prevent the occurrence of disease have not been developed. In out breaks, preventing spread of the virus in the colony by isolation of sick rabbits has met with mixed success . Investigators using rabbitpox virus experimentally should take exceptional precautions to prevent the virus from reaching susceptible rabbit populations. In an epidemic in a large colony, vaccination with vaccinia virus can be used to protect uninfected rabbits (Rosahn et al, 1936b; ).\n\nHerpesviruses have long been recognized as the causative agents of respiratory and genital diseases in humans, cattle, horses, and swine. They are also the recognized causes of other disease syndromes in many species of animals, including neoplastic diseases in frogs, chickens, rabbits, monkeys, and hu mans. An important characteristic of the herpesviruses is the capacity to cause mild or subclinical disease after which viral persistence in a latent state may ensue. Stresses of various kinds may result in viral recrudescence even after prolonged periods 182 rabbits died within 1 week after infection, with only anorexia, fever, and lethargy .

The laboratory rabbit is by definition an experimen tal animal and may frequently be exposed to stresses of various kinds. The possible existence of latent virus infections thus has an important influence on the quality of experimental animals and potentially on the validity of experimental findings. It is in this context that the two currently recognized herpesviruses of rabbits are discussed. (Hinze, , 1971a .

The virus possesses no antigenic relationship to Leporid herpesvirus 2 or to four other mammalian herpesviruses (Hinze, 1971a) . The virus is a gamma herpes virus , in the family Herpesviridae (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 1991). The genome of the virus is similar to those of Herpesvirus saimiri and Epstein-Barr virus, in that it contains a variable number of repetitive DNA elements at both ends Medveczky etal, 1989) . c. EPIDEMIOLOGY. A serological survey in Wisconsin re vealed antibodies to the virus in 6 of 101 wild cottontail rabbits . In experimentally infected cottontail rabbits, herpesvirus was not recovered from feces, urine, milk, ejaculates, or conjunctival and genital secretions, but virus was isolated from the oral secretions of 1 of 15 infected rabbits .

Juvenile rabbits are affected more frequently and severely than adult rabbits. , but, as the original isolate was not available, a direct serological compari-son could not be made. Comparison of the reported character istics of virus III with Herpesvirus cuniculi, however, indicates that they are identical . Virus III was isolated during attempts to find the etiologic agent of varicella (chicken pox). When inoculated into rabbits, the agent induced fever, exanthema, skin vesicles, corneal lesions, and intranuclear in clusions reminiscent of varicella infection . Convalescent sera from human varicella patients failed to inactivate the virus . A similar virus was isolated from serially passaged normal rabbit testicular tissue during investigations of the etiology of rheumatic fe ver (Miller et ai, 1924) . McCartney isolated the virus while working on scarlet fever in England , and the agent has also been isolated by Doerr in Switzerland .\n\nb. ETIOLOGY. showed that the viral isolate possesses the physical, chemical, cytopathic, histological, and electron microscopic characteristics of a herpesvirus. The virus can be propagated in primary or established cell lines of rabbit origin as well as in African green monkey kidney cells. The virus is now designated Leporid herpesvirus 2 . The virus is an unclassified member of the family Herpesviridae (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 1991). c.

Experimen tally, virus was recovered from the blood of rabbits for more than 100 days after inoculation . Ap preciable titers of virus were detected in leukocytes, spleen, liver, lungs, and salivary glands, whereas the concentration of virus in kidneys was variable. However, transmission of the virus by direct contact or transplacentally failed to occur. d. CLINICAL SIGNS. All reported isolations of virus have been from apparently normal rabbits, and no naturally occurring disease has been attributed to infection with the virus. However, a viral agent, presumably a herpesvirus, was recovered from the nares of rabbits with respiratory disease . More recently, acute mortality associated with an un identified herpesvirus was reported in four adult O. cuniculus in two rabbitries . Herpesvirus was recov ered on rabbit kidney cells, and experimental inoculation of rabbits with the virus reproduced the disease syndrome. In both reports, further characterization of the virus is indicated. Exper imentally, intradermal inoculation of rabbits with virus results in pronounced erythema at the site of inoculation after 4 to 7 days, which usually disappears within 2 weeks (Rivers and Til lett, 1924a) . Occasionally, generalized reactions with ano rexia, diarrhea, emaciation, fever, and skin vesicles have been reported. Intradermal inoculation may result in erythematous papules, whereas corneal scarification caused swelling and vesiculation of corneal cells . Intratesticular inoculation of rabbits results in acute orchitis and fever within 3 to 4 days . Intramuscular and subcu taneous inoculation of rabbits failed to induce clinical signs; however, corneal scarification with virus resulted in mild punc tate keratitis . Similarly, intraperitoneal inocu lation of virus did not induce clinical disease ). e. PATHOLOGY. NO gross pathological changes have been observed in internal organs of experimentally infected rabbits. Microscopically, testes, skin, or cornea show edema and an intense mononuclear leukocyte infiltration. Large eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions, typical of herpesviruses, characteristi cally occur in corneal epithelium, interstitial cells of the testi cles, and in endothelial leukocytes of the skin . Severe myocarditis with typical herpesviral in clusions occurred in rabbits inoculated intracardially with virus . The absence of reported cases could be attributed to the relative rarity of disease or to lack of intensive etiologic investigation of cases which do occur.\n\nf. DIAGNOSIS. Natural infection with herpes virus 1 in cot tontail rabbits may result in leukocytosis, splenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Virus can be isolated from the oral cavity and circulating lymphocytes of infected rabbits in rabbit kidney cells . Antibodies can be detected by indirect immunofluorescence and plaque reduction assays Yang et \u03b1\u03af, 1990) . Although a herpes virus has been recovered from European rabbits with respira tory disease , infection has not been definitively linked to disease. However, an unidentified herpes virus has been recovered from an acute fatal disease in domestic rabbits (Onderka et ai, 1992) . g. CONTROL. Both herpesvirus 1 of cottontail rabbits and herpesvirus 2 of domestic rabbits possess the capacity to persist in infected hosts as a subclinical infection. Such infections, if not recognized, could result in considerable confusion in exper imental studies, especially if conditions cause recrudescence of latent infections.\n\nThe family Papovaviridae has two subfamilies, the Papillomavirinae, with a single genus Papillomavirus, and the Polyomavirinae, also with a single genus Polyomavirus (Porterfield, 184 son could not be made.

V I R A L D I S E A S E S J85 1989). Viruses of the genus Papillomavirus cause papillomas (warts) in various animal species and includes two rabbit vi ruses, the cottontail rabbit (Shope) papillomavirus and the rab bit oral papillomavirus. The genus Polyomavirus contains one virus of rabbits, the rabbit kidney vacuolating virus.\n\na. HISTORY. The cottontail rabbit or Shope papillomavirus was recognized as a transmissible agent by while they were attempting to define the etiology of wartlike tumors on cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) in the midwestern United States. They demonstrated the filterability of the infectious agent, transmitted it to other cottontail rab bits as well as domestic rabbits , and described the histopathology of the disease. Rabbit papillomatosis was initially considered a natural benign disease of cottontail rabbits only; however, spontaneous outbreaks of papillomatosis in Oryctolagus cuniculus indicates that the disease has greater relevance. Soon after discovery of the virus, it was also shown to cause malignant neoplasms histologically resembling squamous cell carcinomas Kidd and Rous, 1940) . This was the first recognition of an oncogenic virus in mammals. The disease has served as a model system in numerous investigations aimed at the elucidation of the role of viruses in the etiology of cancer in humans and animals (Evans etaL, 1962a,b; Kreiderand Bartlett, 1981 Georges etaL, 1984; .\n\nb. ETIOLOGY. The virus is the type species of the genus Papillomavirus of the Papovaviridae and possesses the characteristic circular DNA genome, icosahedral structure, and other chemical and physical properties of this family . The virus is antigenically distinct from other members of the genus Papillomavirus. Nuclear and cytoplasmic (Ishimoto etaL, 1970) viral antigens have been demonstrated by immunofluorescence in virus-inoculated nor mal skin cells and virus-induced papillomas. However, the sig nificance of these findings is difficult to interpret since controls for rabbit kidney vacuolating virus, a passenger virus (Hartley and Rowe, 1964) , were usually not included (Kreider and Bart lett, 1981) . The virus can be maintained by serial propagation in the skin of cottontail rabbits, inoculated intracutaneously or scarified with virus . Intramuscular in oculation does not result in clinical papillomatosis. Dogs, cats, pigs, goats, rats, mice, and guinea pigs are refractory to the virus. The skin of embryonic rats is susceptible to the virus, and typical papillomas develop following inoculation ; however, few papillomas develop, and they regress un less the host is immunosuppressed (Kreider et aL, 1971) .\n\nNeoplastic transformation only occurs in epidermis-bearing hair follicles . Cellular proliferation or neoplastic transformation by the virus has been reported in rab bit skin cell cultures , skin cultures derived from neonatal domestic rabbits , and explants of embryonic rabbit skin . Transplantation of transformed skin cultures into rabbits resulted in the formation of papillomas . Papillomas, pri mary carcinomas, and metastases from domestic rabbits have about 10-100 copies of viral DNA, whereas papillomas from cottontail rabbits have 2400 to 8800 copies ). c. EPIDEMIOLOGY. Papillomatosis occurs most frequently as a natural disease of cottontail rabbits in the midwestern United States extending from Minnesota and North Dakota to Texas . The virus has apparently not become established in the eastern states. The only natural out breaks of disease in domestic rabbits were in southern Califor nia, suggesting that the virus is present in wild cottontail rabbits of the area, from which it spread to domestic rabbits by arthro pod vectors . The disease in cottontail rabbits also occurs on coastal islands in Washington, in a population of rabbits introduced from Kansas ( .\n\nThe cottontail rabbit is the natural host, but the domestic rabbit is also susceptible to the virus . Natural outbreaks have been reported in commercial rabbitries . The jackrabbit (Lepus californicus) is also susceptible to the virus . Infection of the skin of do mestic rabbits results in the formation of papillomas essentially devoid of infectious virus . Papillomas can be serially transferred in rabbits, but infectious virus is seldom demonstrated , indi cating that domestic rabbits are not a source of virus for arthro pod vectors. However, Nartsissov, working with virus obtained from Shope, serially passaged the virus in domestic rabbits and demonstrated infectious virus in experimentally produced tu mors . Cottontail rabbits have a 3-fold lower in cidence of carcinomas than domestic rabbits Syverton \u03ad*\u03b1/., 1950) .\n\nInfection of cottontail rabbits, jackrabbits, and snowshoe hares {Lepus americanus) induces lesions containing a high concentration of virus . Contact transmission of papillomatosis may oc cur, but transmission of the virus by the rabbit tick (Haemaphysalis leporis-palustris) is probably the most common natural mode . Transmission by mosquitoes and reduviid bugs has been demonstrated experimentally , but, in view of the low frequency of ticks and bugs in commercial rabbitries, the mosquito may be the principal vector between wild cottontail and domestic rabbits . This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that in nat ural cases of disease in domestic rabbits lesions were confined to the relatively hairless parts of the body around the eyes, ears, and anus, areas where mosquitoes are more apt to bite.

Nematodes may be involved in the natural transmission of virus . Experimentally, papillomas were induced when papillomavirus and larvae of the nematode Nippostrongylus muris were applied to rabbit skin, but not by virus or nematode larvae alone. d. CLINICAL SIGNS. Papillomatosis of wild cottontail rab bits is characterized by the presence of horny warts, usually on the neck, shoulders, or abdomen. The warts begin as red raised areas at the site of infection, grow to become typical papillomas with rough rounded surfaces, and may later develop into large, keratinized horny growths . The virus was initially believed to cause only transient papillomatosis, but it was later shown that in naturally infected cottontail rabbits papillomas may become malignant, being replaced by squamous cell carcinomas . This phe nomenon was later shown to be a relatively frequent occurrence in both naturally and experimentally infected cottontail rabbits, as 25% of infected rabbits developed carcinomatous lesions fol lowing infection (Syverton et \u03b1\u03af, 1950) . In approximately 35% of naturally infected rabbits, papillomas disappeared within 6 months after infection.\n\nIn natural outbreaks of papillomatosis of domestic rabbits in southern California , papillomas most commonly occurred on the eyelids and ears (Fig. 8) . Experimentally in duced papillomas develop more slowly in domestic rabbits than in cottontail rabbits, reach a stationary phase, and then occa sionally regress. Beard (1934, 1935) recognized the malignant potential of rabbit papillomavirus when they dem onstrated that intramuscular inoculation of papillomatous tissue into domestic rabbits resulted in invasive squamous cell carci nomas. In experimentally infected domestic rabbits, 75% devel oped carcinomas if kept longer than 6 months (Syverton, 1952) . Thus, regression of papillomas occurred less frequently in do mestic rabbits than in cottontail rabbits. e. PATHOLOGY. The warts which develop following infec tion in cottontail and domestic rabbits are typical papillomas. The malignant tumors which arise from papillomas are squa mous cell carcinomas. Metastasis to regional lymph nodes, par ticularly the axillary nodes, is common , and about 25% of rabbits that succumb have pulmonary metastases. In addition, amyloid deposition in renal glomeruli, hepatic sinusoids, and splenic red pulp is present in many rabbits.\n\nf. DIAGNOSIS. Cottontail rabbit papillomatosis is diagnosed clinically by the characteristic skin tumors, which never occur in the mouth, and may be confirmed by histopathological ex amination.

The endemic disease of cottontail rabbits is of little economic significance, and thus no prophylactic meth ods have been developed. Because natural infection occurs in domestic rabbits , the adoption of control meth ods may become necessary. In areas where the disease is en demic in wild cottontail rabbits, where arthropod vectors are present, and where outdoor rabbit husbandry is practiced, ar thropod control would appear to be a logical approach. Rabbits can be immunized by two intraperitoneal inoculations with glycerinated rabbit papilloma suspensions . Domes tic rabbits with experimentally induced papillomas resisted challenge with virus derived from papillomas of cottontail rab bits . A tumor-specific vaccine composed of allogenic tumor cells increased the regression rate of papillomas (Evansefa/., 1962a).\n\na. HISTORY.

They found a 17% preva lence of small papillomas in the mouths of rabbits of several breeds in New York City. The lesions were usually confined to the ventral surface of the tongue. They transmitted the virus to both domestic and cottontail rabbits and by cross-immunity tests and tissue-susceptibility studies demonstrated that it was distinct from the cottontail rabbit (Shope) papillomavirus. They also showed that virus is frequently present in the mouths of rabbits without lesions, and that tattooing or licking of tar stim ulated lesion development in such carrier rabbits . A spontaneous outbreak in New York of rabbit oral papillomatosis, involving several breeds of domestic rab bits, was described into domestic rabbits resulted in invasive squamous cell carcinomas.

The virus was partly characterized by Par sons and and was later included in the genus Papillomavirus of the family Papovaviridae . The virus is immunologically distinct from the cottontail rabbit (Shope) papillomavirus and infects only leporids (Par sons and . Nuclear viral replication, charac teristic of the papovavirus group, has been demonstrated . Neonatal hamsters, inoculated subcutaneously with a tumor suspension from natu rally infected rabbits, developed fibromas . The virus has not been propagated outside of susceptible host animals.\n\nc. EPIDEMIOLOGY. The virus probably spreads by direct contact, and lesion development may require oral trauma for viral entry. Coarse feed, maloccluded teeth, or other oral irri tants may serve as the inciting event . Experimentally induced lesions appear 9 to 38 days after inoculation , but the incubation period of the natural disease is unknown. The disease generally occurs in rabbits 2 to 18 months old (Weis broth and Scher, 1970; Sundberg etal, 1985) . d. CLINICAL SIGNS. Oral papillomatosis is a benign disease characterized clinically by small discrete whitish growths on the ventral surface of the tongue (Fig. 9 ). The early lesions are sessile, later become rugose or pedunculated, and ultimately ulcerate . The lesions are seldom more than 5 mm in size and 4 mm in thickness and usually substantially smaller. Papillomas have been known to persist for as long as 145 days, but usually disappear in weeks . Le- sions rarely occur elsewhere in the mouth and never on the body. e. PATHOLOGY. The lesions are microscopically typical papillomas . Cells in the stratum spinosum contain basophilic intra nuclear inclusions (Fig. 10) Sundberg etal, 1985) .\n\nf. DIAGNOSIS. The disease is diagnosed by typical lesions occurring only in the mouth, in contrast to rabbit papillomato sis, in which lesions are observed only on the skin. The lesions are typical papillomas, and papillomavirus antigens can be detected in cells of the stratum spinosum by the peroxidaseantiperoxidase technique . g. CONTROL. Rabbits recovering from disease are resistant to reinfection but are susceptible to the unrelated cottontail rab bit (Shope) papillomavirus.\n\nThe rabbit kidney vacuolating virus was isolated in primary rabbit kidney cell cultures from papillomas of cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) collected in Kansas (Hartley and Rowe, 1964) . The virus causes vacuolar cytopathic effects in cell cul tures. The virus resembles the cottontail rabbit (Shope) papil lomavirus but is a distinct virus. It does not produce papillomas when inoculated into rabbits and does not immunize rabbits against rabbit papillomavirus. The virus is slightly smaller than the viruses of the genus Papillomavirus and resembles polyomavirus in size, morphology, and DNA composition (Craw ford and Follett, 1967) .

Rabbits recovering from disease are resistant to reinfection but are susceptible to the unrelated cottontail rabbit (Shope) papillomavirus.\n\nThe rabbit kidney vacuolating virus was isolated in primary rabbit kidney cell cultures from papillomas of cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagusfioridanus) collected in Kansas (Hartley and Rowe, 1964) . The virus causes vacuolar cytopathic effects in cell cultures. The virus resembles the cottontail rabbit (Shope) papillomavirus but is a distinct virus. It does not produce papillomas when inoculated into rabbits and does not immunize rabbits against rabbit papillomavirus. The virus is slightly smaller than the viruses of the genus Papillomavirus and resembles polyomavirus in size, morphology, and DNA composition . The virus has been classified as a member of the genus Polyomavirus within the family Papovaviridae . Ultrastructurally, the virus is a typi cal papovavirus in its replication pattern . The virus is not pathogenic for either domestic or cotton tail rabbits or any other animal species. Inoculation of both neonatal and adult domestic and cottontail rabbits by several routes did not induce disease (Hartley and Rowe, 1964) . Anti bodies to the virus have been found in wild cottontail rabbits in Kansas and Maryland, but not in domestic rabbits (Hartley and Rowe, 1964) . The virus thus appears to be a fairly common nonpathogenic virus of cottontail rabbits, causing only latent infections. Although a contaminant of rabbit papillomas, the virus appears to have no role in the pathogenesis of papillomatosis .\n\nAn adenovirus was isolated in Hungary from the spleen, kid neys, lungs, and intestines of rabbits, 6-8 weeks old, with diar rhea . The virus was detected in primary rabbit kidney cultures stained with acridine orange, as no cyto pathic effect was observed. The virus failed to replicate in pig kidney, calf kidney, calf testicle, or human embryonic lung cells. Antisera to several swine and bovine adenoviruses failed to neutralize the virus, whereas a partial antigenic relationship to human adenoviruses was demonstrated by complement fixa tion and immunodiffusion tests. The virus agglutinated rabbit but not human erythrocytes. A serological survey of 30 Oryctolagus cuniculus from four rabbitries in Quebec revealed that three rabbits from three colonies had antibodies to bovine ade novirus type 1 . Experimental inocu lation of rabbits with human adenovirus type 5 resulted in no clinical response but induced a persistent viral infection in lymphoid tissues for as long as 1 year .\n\nA virus that produced cytopathic effects in primary rabbit kidney cell cultures was isolated from the feces of a rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) inoculated with Herpesvirus cuniculi in a laboratory in Japan . The virus had the morphological, physical, and chemical properties of a parvovi rus. The various proteins of the virus have been characterized ). Subsequently, parvovirus was recovered from kidney cells of neonatal rabbits in the United States (Metcalf et ah, 1989) . Among 90 rabbits from a commer cial source in Japan, 42 (47%) had hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody to the virus (Matsunaga etal., 1977) . Of 46 rabbit sera, collected from various sources in the United States, 75% had antibodies detected by immunofluorescence or hemagglutination inhibition assays . In Switzerland, over 70% of 132 rabbit sera from various commercial breeding colonies had antibodies in the hemagglutination inhibition test . Experimental inoculation, orally or intra venously, induced anorexia, listlessness, and catarrhal enteritis in 1-month-old rabbits . Virus was detected in feces, small intestine, liver, pancreas, spleen, appendix, and mesenteric lymph node. Rabbits developed hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies.\n\nRotavirus was initially isolated from rabbits with diarrhea by in England. Virus was recovered from both sporadic cases and outbreaks of diarrhea in weanling rabbits as well as from healthy rabbits. Subsequently, rotavirus was iso lated from young rabbits with diarrhea in Japan , Europe , and the United States (DiGiacomo and . Various serological sur veys have since revealed that rotavirus infection is widespread in domesticated rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus).\n\nRotaviruses belong to the family Reoviridae (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 1991). They are icosahedral viruses with a double capsid shell which contains 11 seg ments of double-stranded RNA, each of which codes for a protein. The sixth gene codes for a structural protein which contains the subgroup specificity. The product of the fourth and seventh, eighth, or ninth genes are the viral neutralization anti gens, VP4 and VP7. VP4 is the viral hemagglutin and must be cleaved to yield VP5 and VP8 before the virus can infect cells (Matsui etal., 1989; Ramig and Ward, 1991) .\n\nThe five groups of rotaviruses, identified as A, B, C, D, and E , are divided into two subgroups, I and II ). The rabbit rotaviruses described be long to group A, subgroups I and II . Although group A rotaviruses comprise 14 serotypes , only serotype 3 is found in rabbits . Serotype 3 is common to humans and several other animals and is defined by more than one epitope . Some rotavirus isolates from rabbits induce a cytopathic effect in MA 104 rhesus monkey kidney cells in about 3 days (Sato etal, 1982; Castrucci etal, 1985; Thouless etal, 1986) , whereas other isolates demonstrate cytopathic effect only after additional passages. Physicochemical studies reveal that iso lates are resistant to pH 3 and 20% ether and are partially sen sitive to 10% chloroform (Castrucci etal, 1985) . Additionally, they are inactivated when heated at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, even in 188 member of the genus Polyomavirus within the family Papovaviridae .

History Rotavirus was initially isolated from rabbits with diarrhea by in England. Virus was recovered from both sporadic cases and outbreaks of diarrhea in weanling rabbits as well as from healthy rabbits. Subsequently, rotavirus was isolated from young rabbits with diarrhea in Japan , Europe (Peeters et ai., 1982 (Peeters et ai., , 1984 Castrucci et aI., 1985) , and the United States (DiGiacomo and . Various serological surveys have since revealed that rotavirus infection is widespread in domesticated rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus).\n\nRotaviruses belong to the family Reoviridae (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 1991). They are icosahedral viruses with a double capsid shell which contains 11 segments of double-stranded RNA, each of which codes for a protein. The sixth gene codes for a structural protein which contains the subgroup specificity. The product of the fourth and seventh, eighth, or ninth genes are the viral neutralization antigens, VP4 and VP7. VP4 is the viral hemagglutin and must be cleaved to yield VP5 and VP8 before the virus can infect cells Ramig and Ward, 1991) .\n\nThe five groups of rotaviruses, identified as A, B, C, D, and E (Pedley et aI., 1986) , are divided into two subgroups, I and II . The rabbit rotaviruses described belong to group A, subgroups I and II (Thouless et aI., 1986; Tanaka et aI., 1988) . Although group A rotaviruses comprise 14 serotypes , only serotype 3 is found in rabbits . Serotype 3 is common to humans and several other animals and is defined by more than one epitope (Hoshino et aI., 1984; . Some rotavirus isolates from rabbits induce a cytopathic effect in MAI04 rhesus monkey kidney cells in about 3 days Castrucci et aI., 1985; Thouless et aI., 1986) , whereas other isolates demonstrate cytopathic effect only after additional passages. Physicochemical studies reveal that isolates are resistant to pH 3 and 20% ether and are partially sensitive to 100/0 chloroform . Additionally, they are inactivated when heated at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, even in the presence of MgCl 2 . Electron microscopy of negatively stained preparations reveal virus particles of 75-80 nm in diameter.\n\nSerological studies indicate that rotavirus infection is wide spread in domesticated rabbits (O. cuniculus). Of 91 adult rab bits from two commercial rabbitries in Ontario, Canada, 98% had antibodies to rotavirus (Petric et al, 1978) . A survey in Tokyo prefecture, Japan, of 39 adult rabbits revealed that 82% had antibodies . A more extensive sur vey of 10 breeding and 13 laboratory colonies in metropolitan Tokyo and Ibaragi, Saitama, Kanagawa, Shizuoka, and Nagano prefectures in Japan revealed antibodies to rotavirus in 83% of the 23 colonies and in 81% of 160 sera . In Hungary, 74% (range 40-100%) of 112 sera from five largescale rabbit farms had rotavirus antibodies . In the United States, 95% of 149 sera from rabbits more than 2 months old in a commercial colony in Washington had antibodies (DiGiacomo and . Rotavirus was de tected in fecal samples from rabbits in three other colonies in the state (DiGiacomo and . Antibodies against rotavirus have also been detected in 29% of 17 sera from cot tontail rabbits (Sylvilagusfloridanus) in Ontario, 52% of 27 sera from snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) in the Yukon, and 6% of 48 sera from snowshoe hares in Nova Scotia (Petric etaL, 1978) .\n\nIn colonies with endemic rotavirus infection, nearly all adult rabbits have serological evidence of rotavirus infection (Di Giacomo and . Litters in such colonies have transplacentally acquired maternal antibodies to rotavirus at birth. In the absence of rotavirus infection, the antibodies fall to undetectable levels by 60 days of age. In colonies with en demic infection, shedding of rotavirus in the feces is detected in rabbits 4 to 7 weeks old (Peeters et \u03b1\u03af, 1984) , followed by the appearance of naturally acquired antibodies in rabbits greater than 6 weeks old (DiGiacomo and ). Subsequently, infected rabbits demonstrate antibodies for long periods. Hence, in infected colonies, rabbits usually acquire in fection when maternal antibodies have declined to low concen trations, which usually coincides with weaning. Both sexes appear equally susceptible. Rotavirus infection in domesticated rabbits has been reported in New Zealand White, Dutch, and Californian rabbits, suggesting no difference in breed suscepti bility (Bryden etaL, 1976) .\n\nRotavirus is shed in the feces of infected rabbits. In a survey of 187 rabbits of mixed ages, rotavirus was detected in 4% of fecal samples (Petric et al, 1978) . In another study, 11% of 18 fecal samples contained virus . Rota virus was detected in 9% of 106 fecal samples from healthy rabbits, 1 to 2 months old, from four rabbitries (DiGiacomo and . Hence, transmission probably occurs by fecaloral spread. Rabbits inoculated orally with rotavirus shed virus in the feces for 6 to 8 days, beginning 2 to 5 days after inocu lation (Petric etaL, 1978; Castrucci etaL, 1984; Thouless etaL, 1988; Hambraeus et al, 1989) . Further more, uninoculated control rabbits maintained in the same room with inoculated rabbits also acquired rotavirus infection (Thou less et al, 1988; . As fomite transmission appeared unlikely because of the handling of uninoculated rab bits first, it was concluded that rabbits were infected by airborne transmission of virus.\n\nRotavirus was initially detected and recovered from rabbits with diarrhea by . That report included both sporadic cases and outbreaks in 5-week-old rabbits. A spectrum in the severity of disease associated with rotavirus infection has been reported, which is probably influenced by a synergy among various microorganisms responsible for diarrheal dis eases in rabbits. In outbreaks of diarrhea associated with rota virus infection, rabbits 30-80 days old are usually affected . Rabbits exhibit severe mucous or watery diarrhea, anorexia, and dehydration, with mortality of 60-80%. In one outbreak, rabbits 8 to 12 days old had a greenish-yellow watery diarrhea . About 20% of litters were affected, with 98% mortality within 1 to 2 days after onset of signs. A similar disease was reported in a specific pathogen-free colony in which litters 7 to 21 days old exhibited watery diarrhea and lethargy . Approximately 40% of affected litters died within 2 days after onset of signs. That preweanling rabbits were affected in both outbreaks suggests that rotavirus had been recently introduced into the colonies.\n\nIn a comprehensive study of various infectious agents (para sites, bacteria, and viruses) associated with diarrhea in 21 rab bitries, detected rotavirus in 35% of 130 affected rabbits. However, the clinical signs associated with rotavirus infection consisted of watery diarrhea for 2 to 3 days, with low mortality. That rotavirus may be only mildly patho genic is supported by experimental studies. In general, orogastric inoculation of rabbits, 1 to 22 weeks old, with rotavirus did not result in diarrhea, although some rabbits developed soft or fluid feces for 2 to 4 days (Petric et al, 1978; Hambraeus et al, 1989) . Whereas inoculation of one rotavirus strain induced diarrhea, depression, anorexia, and mortality in rabbits , this could not be repeated . Hence, in endemically infected colonies, other factors, including other in fectious agents, may enhance the pathogenicity of rotavirus (Peeters ef 0/., 1984) .\n\nIn weanling rabbits infected with rotavirus, the intestines are markedly congested and distended, and petechiae are found in the colon . In addition to congestion, there are mucosal hemorrhages in the small intestine and distention of 9.

In Hungary, 74% (range 40-1000/0) of 112 sera from five largescale rabbit farms had rotavirus antibodies .

However, in both of the reports, the presence of other infectious agents was not examined. reported that, in pure rotavirus infection, gross lesions are limited to fluid cecal contents and swollen mesenteric lymph nodes. Histologically, the small in testine shows moderate to severe villous atrophy, more marked in the ileum. Apical enterocytes on the tips of villi are swollen, rounded, and desquamating; occasionally tips are denuded. The lamina propria is usually infiltrated with lymphocytes and oc casional neutrophils. Lesions in the cecum are limited to focal areas of enterocyte desquamation. In outbreaks involving preweanling rabbits, gross lesions are most pronounced in the il eum . Microscopically, there is villous atrophy and attenuation or desquamation of epithelial cells at the apical tips of jejunal or ileal villi . In some areas, the submucosa is edematous(Schoeb^\u00f6/., 1986).\n\nExperimentally, rabbits inoculated orally with rotavirus have markedly congested and distended intestines with accumulation of fluid and gas in the small intestine, cecum, and colon from 2 to 9 days after inoculation (Petric et al, 1978; . Microscopically, low to moderate numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells infiltrate the villi and lamina propria of the small intestine . Occasionally, villous atrophy is observed in the il eum. There is mild lymphoid reactivity in mesenteric lymph nodes. Lesions are not observed in the cecum or colon.\n\nDiarrhea caused by rotavirus is diagnosed from clinical signs, histopathology, detection of the virus, and demonstration of antibodies. Clinical signs and pathological findings alone are not diagnostic, although villous atrophy and degeneration and desquamation of enterocytes at the tips of villi in the small intestine are characteristic features. Rotaviral diarrhea must be differentiated from other diarrheal diseases of rabbits such as coccidiosis, salmonellosis, Tyzzer's disease, clostridial enterotoxemia, and colibacillosis. In weanling rabbits with severe dis ease, the possibility of dual infections should be considered, since rotavirus infections are usually mild. Electron microscopy or a capture enzymelinked immunosorbent assay can be used to detect rotavirus in feces Ham braeus et al, 1989) . Cytoplasmic fluorescence can be observed at the tips of ileal villi using indirect immunofluorescence (Pe tric et al, 1978) . Serum antibodies to rotavirus can be detected by enzyme immunoassay Hambraeus etal, 1989; Conner etal, 1991) . Rabbits with rotaviral diarrhea usually have no or low concentrations of antibody to rotavirus, with a subsequent rise 2 to 4 weeks after onset of signs . Nonaffected littermates develop high antibody concentrations, reflecting concurrent subclinical infections.\n\nRotavirus is highly infectious and is transmitted by fecaloral spread; however, fomites cannot be excluded. Transplacental transmission has not been demonstrated. Infection appears to be acute and self-limiting. Experimentally, virus is shed in the feces for about 1 week following inoculation (Petric et al, 1978; Hambraeus et al, 1989) . Recovered rabbits are refractory to challenge with homologous (Castrucci etal, 1984; Hambraeus et al, 1989) or heterologous viruses . Hence, cessation of breeding or quarantine of the colony for 4 to 6 weeks, to prevent the introduction of susceptible rabbits, should permit the infec tion to run its course. As seropositive dams are not infectious, their offspring should remain free of infection after maternal antibodies disappear. Early weaning of rabbits with high con centrations of passively acquired maternal antibodies and re moval to isolated facilities offer the possibility of rederiving rabbits free of infection. Prevention of rotavirus infection de pends on barrier maintenance of rabbits.\n\na. HISTORY. During the 1960s in Scandinavia, increased mortality in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) inoculated with the Nichols strain of Treponema pallidum ) was attributed to a virus, named the Stockholm agent, present in rabbit testicular emulsions . As the principal necropsy finding was pleural effusion, the name pleu ral effusion disease was suggested . Later, it was shown that the major target organ was the heart, and the name infectious cardiomyopathy was suggested, since the etiologic agent appeared to be a coronavirus . The resemblance of the clinicopathological features to feline infectious peritonitis, a systemic coronavirus infection of cats, was noted . The failure to propa gate the agent in vitro has precluded more definitive character ization. It is unclear whether the agent is a naturally occurring pathogen of rabbits or a virus from another species adapted to rabbits in contaminated treponemal stocks. However, the dis ease may be useful as a model for virus-induced cardiomyopa thy .\n\nb. ETIOLOGY.

Rabbits developed fever, circulatory insufficiency with pulmonary edema, and pleural effusion and had high mortality Gudjonsson et aI., 1970) . Subsequent inoculation of rabbits with pulmonary tissue and pleural fluid from dead rabbits, previously inoculated with treponemes, resulted in a similar syndrome . Differential filtration of pleural fluid and serum from rabbits revealed an infectious particle size of 25-50 nm, which is ether sensitive and inactivated at tempera tures of 65\u00b0C or above but not at 56\u00b0C . Sera from rabbits contained pleomorphic virus particles, round or elliptic, 75 to 100 nm in diameter, bearing club-shaped projec tions 15-20 nm long , whereas plasma from rabbits contained high concentrations of pleomorphic viruslike particles measuring 51 to 98 nm in diameter with projections 8-13 nm long . Infectious sera, passed on various cell lines, produced a cytopathic effect in primary rabbit kidney and newborn human intestine cells . However, the cellular pathogenic effect was lost after two passages. Disease was not induced in mice, hamsters, or guinea pigs .\n\nIn a complement fixation test, antigens in infectious sera cross-reacted with antisera to the 229E (two-way cross) and OC43 (one-way cross) strains of human coronavirus . Antisera to the rabbit cardiomyopathy agent crossreacted with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), canine coronavirus (CCV), and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) by radioimmunoassay . Prior incubation of the agent with antisera to CCV, FIPV, TGEV, or 229E virus reduced mortality in rabbits following inoculation. However, prior immunization of rabbits with CCV, FIPV, or TGEV had little effect on survival. Immunofluorescent staining of cardiac tissue from diseased rabbits with antisera to 229E virus revealed antigen in myocardial interstitial tissue, and rabbits surviving infection developed antibodies to the vi rus in a complement fixation assay . In an other study, however, surviving rabbits failed to demonstrate antibodies against 229E virus in an enzyme immunoassay and neutralization test, and against OC43 virus in a complement fixation test . c. EPIDEMIOLOGY. When the disease was recognized in 1961, rabbits used in the serial propagation of T. pallidwn had a mortality rate of 2%. By the end of the 1960s, however, mor tality had increased to 35-40% owing to contamination of treponemal stocks with virus . There is no difference in disease among breeds (Gud jonsson and Skog, 1970) or between rabbits in the United States and Sweden . The agent was detected in T. pallidum-infected rabbit tissues from Europe, the United States, and Japan . Nine isolates, ob tained from treponema-infected rabbits in various countries, ex hibited a wide range in pathogenicity when inoculated into rabbits . Whereas virtually all rabbits had fever, mortality ranged from 0 to 88%, and all surviving rabbits resisted challenge with a virulent strain. Two of four dams from litters inoculated at 6 to 9 days of age became in fected, whereas uninoculated littermates or introduced cage-mates failed to develop infection after exposure for several months . Hence, transmission by direct contact occurs rarely. d. CLINICAL SIGNS. Whereas clinical features vary by strain and passage of the agent, inoculated rabbits generally develop a fever in 1 to 4 days which persists for 5 to 10 days. Other clinical signs include anorexia, weight loss, atony, tachypnea, and iridocyclitis. With virulent strains, many rabbits die 3 to 5 days after inoculation, although deaths can occur until 14 days Fennestad etal, 1975 Fennestad etal, , 1986 Fledelius etal, 1978; Small etal, 1979; . Generalized or hindquarter muscular weak ness was also reported in rabbits surviving the acute phase of infection . During the acute phase of infection, rabbits have a transient lymphopenia, followed by heterophilia . Red cell indices were also reduced but returned to normal by 6 weeks after inoculation. There was a transient hypoalbuminemia; however, 7-globulin increased significantly . Serum potassium and lactate dehyrogenase were elevated transiently. Surviving rabbits usually returned to nor mal in 3 to 4 weeks. Reinoculation of surviving rabbits was without effect, indicating development of resistance to the agent Fennestad \u00a3i a/., 1986 ). e. PATHOLOGY. Rabbits dying during the acute phase of disease have pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, and dilation of the right ventricle Alexander et al, , 1993 . The pleural cavities con tain 2-50 ml of fluid, with or without fibrin, and few cells; ascites may also occur in rabbits dying after the first week. There are subepicardial and subendocardial hemorrhages. Other findings may include hepatosplenomegaly and congested lymph nodes. The heart weight is increased, and there is dilation of the right ventricle followed by dilation of the left ventricle. The cause of death appears to be congestive heart failure (Small etal, 1979; Baric etal, 1990; Edwards etal, 1992; Alexander et al, , 1993 . In fatal cases, there is a uniform reduction of splenic white pulp, focal degenerative changes of the thymus and lymph nodes, and mild proliferative changes of renal glomeruli . In rabbits that survive the acute phase, there is multifocal to diffuse myo cardial degeneration and necrosis, focal hepatic necrosis, and proliferative changes in the spleen, lymph nodes, interstitial pulmonary tissue, and renal glomeruli. Lesions similar to those in the heart can occur in the diaphragm . A mild nonsuppurative, nongranulomatous anterior uveitis devel ops during the acute phase of infection and regresses within 4 weeks . At 65 days after infection, myocarditis is evident, and about one-third of rabbits had evi dence of right and/or left-sided cardiac dilation (Baric et al, 9. VIRAL DISEASES inoculated with treponemes, resulted in a similar syndrome (Gudjonsson et aI., 1970) .

PATHOLOGY. Rabbits dying during the acute phase of disease have pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, and dilation of the right ventricle (Fennestad et aI., 1975; Christensen et aI., 1978; Small et aI., 1979; Baric et aI., 1990; Edwards et aI., 1992; Alexander et aI., 1992 Alexander et aI., , 1993 .

At 65 days after infection, myocarditis is evident, and about one-third of rabbits had evidence of right and/or left-sided cardiac dilation (Baric et aI., 1990) . After 2 years, rabbits had pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphoid hyperplasia of lymph nodes and spleen, siderosis in the spleen, necrosis and periportal inflammation in the liver, and interstitial fibrosis of the myocardium . No evidence of circulating or tissue immune com plexes was found .\n\nf. DIAGNOSIS. It remains to be determined whether the agent is a naturally occurring pathogen of rabbits or perhaps a human virus adapted to rabbits in contaminated stocks of the Nichols strain of T. pallidum. The syndrome has only been reported in experimentally inoculated rabbits. The clinical course is characterized by onset of fever 1 to 3 days after inoc ulation. Deaths may occur from 2 to 17 days after inoculation, and mortality may exceed 75%. Other major signs include oc ular disease, anorexia, weight loss, tachypnea, and atony. The gross and histological lesions are highly characteristic of the disease. Antibodies to the virus cross-react with the human coronavirus 229E and other members of the group I mammalian coronaviruses (FIPV, CCV, and TGEV).\n\ng. CONTROL. Because continued serial propagation of T. pallidum in rabbits coincided with emergence of disease associated with this agent, the possibility of contaminated stocks should be considered Fennes tad et aL, 1975; . Rabbits inoculated with virus-contaminated T. pallidum stocks that elicited no or mild disease without mortality were protected from disease when rechallenged with stocks contaminated with more pathogenic virus Fennestad et ai, 1980 Fennestad et ai, , 1986 . This in dicated that some T. pallidum stocks were contaminated with a nonpathogenic variant of the virus, which was able to confer protection. Furthermore, isolates decreased in pathogenicity, as a function of time, in rabbits that survived acute infection (Fen nestad, 1985; . Convalescent sera from rabbits that survived infection partially protected challenged rabbits against mortality but not disease . Passage of contaminated T. pallidum stocks through hamsters removed the agent responsible for disease Fenne stad et aL, 1980) . Subsequent reintroduction of these T. pallidum stocks in rabbits was without effect. Similarly, inoculation of rabbits, with popliteal lymph nodes from surviving rabbits, transferred treponemes but not the agent .\n\na. HISTORY. A coronavirus was detected in the feces of rabbits with diarrhea by in Canada. Rab bits were 6 to 10 weeks old and from several colonies. Subse quently, coronavirus was detected in young rabbits with diarrhea in several European countries . Although the virus appears to be readily detected in rabbits by workers in Canada , the failure to propagate the agent in vitro has hampered investigations of its prevalence in rabbit {Oryctolagus cuniculus) populations.\n\nb. ETIOLOGY. Feces of rabbits with diarrhea exhibit hemagglutination activity with rabbit erythrocytes, particularly with a peak of 1.18 g/cm 3 from a sucrose density gradient . Electron microscopy of fecal samples revealed pleomorphic particles with an inner diameter of 60-220 nm and surface projections of 20 nm . Particles obtained from a Percoll gradient appeared as spherical enveloped particles 40-50 nm in size with projections of 10-12 nm . In rabbits inoculated orally, pleomorphic particles 60-90 nm, with surface projections of 10 nm, were detected in the feces . Electron microscopy of fecal samples using antisera to rabbit coronavirus revealed immune aggregates of viral particles with morphological features of co ronaviruses . Analysis of structural polypeptides by immunoblotting revealed that antisera to avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV) and TGEV detected many of the same epitopes as antisera to the rabbit coronavirus (Desco teaux et aL, 1985) . Immune sera to 229E, but not AIBV and porcine hemagglutinating encephalitis virus, inhibited the hemagglutination activity of the rabbit coronavirus. No cytopathic effect occurred following inoculation of various cell lines with fecal samples . c. EPIDEMIOLOGY. In a survey of 130 diarrheic rabbits from 21 rabbitries, coronavirus was detected in the cecal contents of one rabbit in association with Escherichia coli infection (Pee ters et aL, 1984) . Rabbits with diarrheal disease associated with coronavirus infection are usually 3 to 10 weeks old (La Pierre et aL, 1980; . Virus has also been detected in the feces of apparently healthy rabbits . Experimentally, orally inoculated rabbits shed virus for up to 29 days . A serological survey of 238 O. cuniculus from six rabbitries revealed that 23 (10%) had antibodies to canine coronavirus . d. CLINICAL SIGNS. In an outbreak of enteric disease in 3-to 8-week-old rabbits in a barrier-maintained breeding col ony, rabbits exhibited lethargy, diarrhea, and swollen abdomens . Between 40 and 60% of rabbits were affected, and virtually all died within 24 hr after onset of signs. also reported rapid death following the onset of clinical signs in the majority of affected rabbits. Experimen tally, rabbits developed soft feces or watery diarrhea of brief dura tion after inoculation. However, none of the rabbits died (Des coteaux and Lussier, 1990 ). e. PATHOLOGY. In rabbits with diarrhea, the perianal region is soiled with feces . Rabbits appear cachectic and 192 1990) . After 2 years, rabbits had pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia, lymphoid hyperplasia of lymph nodes and spleen, siderosis in the spleen, necrosis and periportal inflammation in the liver, and interstitial fibrosis of the myocardium (Fennestad et ai., 1986) . No evidence of circulating or tissue immune complexes was found (Fennestad et ai., 1981 (Fennestad et ai., , 1986 .\n\nf. DIAGNOSIS.

In rabbits with diarrhea, the perianal region is soiled with feces . Rabbits appear cachectic and dehydrated. Although the stomach and intestines are unaf fected, the cecum is distended with watery fluid . Histologically, in the small and large intes tines there is a diffuse infiltration of inflammatory cells and mucosal edema . In an experimental study, the small intestines were congested and the cecal contents watery . Microscopically, at 6 hr after inoculation, there was necrosis of enterocytes at the tips of in testinal villi. Villous atrophy and hypertrophic crypts were pres ent 2 to 3 days after inoculation. However, by 6 days microscopic lesions were absent.\n\nf. DIAGNOSIS. Rabbits with diarrheal disease are usually recently weaned and 3 to 10 weeks old . Because the rabbit coronavirus agglutinates erythrocytes, the hemagglutination activity of the feces pro vides an indication of the presence of virus . Coronavirus particles can be demonstrated in the feces by electron Pee ters etaL, 1984; and immunoelectron microscopy. The latter technique is more sensitive in detecting virus particles . At necropsy, the cecal contents are fluid ; histo logically, there is intestinal villous atrophy . Adult rabbits may have antibodies in the hemag glutination inhibition assay . As experi mental inoculation of rabbits with coronavirus failed to mimic the field disease with its high morbidity and mortality, consid eration should be given to the existence of copathogens (Oster haus etaL, 1982; . In two studies where other agents were considered, coronavirus was associ ated with E. coli and Clostridium perfringens infections (Pee ters ef aL, 1984; . g. CONTROL. Because only one naturally occurring out break of diarrheal disease associated with coronavirus has been reported , there is scant information on control of the disease. The feeding of hay, delay in weaning, and admin istration of coccidiostats and antibiotics were ineffective in pre venting mortality.\n\nThe etiologic agents of necrotic hepatitis of leporids are the most recent viruses to be described. They have been classified tentatively as caliciviruses. The diseases caused by these viruses appeared in the mid 1980s. Rabbit or viral hemorrhagic disease was reported in China in 1984 and subsequently in other coun tries. European brown hare syndrome was observed in Europe several years before viral hemorrhagic disease was diagnosed in domestic rabbits. The diseases are similar and appear to be caused by related viruses. Because the first recognized outbreak in China occurred in rabbits imported from Europe and since reports of a similar disease in European hares predates the out break in China, the original source of the agent of viral hemor rhagic disease may have been wild Leporidae (Lepus europaeus and Oryctolagus cuniculus) in Europe .\n\na. HISTORY. In early 1984, an acute fatal disease of rabbits was reported from many regions of China . The disease was unlike any previously re ported syndrome and may have originated in rabbits imported from Europe. Tests of rabbit sera stored in Czechoslovakia in 1978 revealed antibodies to the virus . Although the syndrome was initially variously named, it came to be known as rabbit or viral hemorrhagic disease. Subse quently, the disease was reported in several European countries in 1987 and 1988 . By late 1988, the disease was reported from many locations in Mexico House, 1989, Gutierrez, 1990) .\n\nb. ETIOLOGY. A virus has been consistently purified from the liver and spleen of affected rabbits, the characteristics of which have been described by several investigators Ohlinger and Theil, 1991; . The virus is nonenveloped, spherical, and 28-34 nm in diameter and has a buoyant density of 1.32-1.38 g/cm 3 . The icosahedral capsid has 32 cylindrical capsomeres, 5-6 nm in diameter. The capsid is comprised of four structural polypeptides: VP1, 60-61 kDa; VP2, 54.7 kDa; VP3, 52 kDa; and VP4, 26-28 kDa. The virus has been reported to be a picornavirus , calicivirus Rodak et aL, 1990b; Ohlinger and Theil, 1991; , or parvovirus . Hence, the current classification must be considered pro visional. Immunoblotting of the virus reveals three major pro teins of 38, 52, and 61 kDa, with the latter being dominant . Comparison of nucleic acid sequences reveals significant homology with feline calicivirus (Meyers et aL, 1991a,b) . The virus agglutinates erythrocytes of humans and guinea pigs, but not rabbits.\n\nThe virus is highly stable in the environment; viral infectivity is unaffected by treatment with ether, chloroform, exposure to pH 3, or heating at 50\u00b0C. However, the virus is inactivated by 1% sodium hydroxide or 0.4% formaldehyde at ambient temperature, 4\u00b0, or 37\u00b0C. The virus fails to grow in many pri mary and established cell lines but has been adapted to a trans formed rabbit kidney cell line . Rabbits may be the only species susceptible to infection, as 9.

Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus a. HISTORY. In early 1984, an acute fatal disease of rabbits was reported from many regions of China (Xu et aI., 1988~Xu and ). The disease was unlike any previously reported syndrome and may have originated in rabbits imported from Europe. Tests of rabbit sera stored in Czechoslovakia in 1978 revealed antibodies to the virus (Rodak et aI., 1990a) . Although the syndrome was initially variously named, it came to be known as rabbit or viral hemorrhagic disease. Subsequently, the disease was reported in several European countries in 1987 and 1988 (Patton, 1989~Gregg and House, 1989~Parra and Prieto, 1990 . By late 1988, the disease was reported from many locations in Mexico (Patton, 1989~Gregg and House, 1989 .\n\nb. ETIOLOGY. A virus has been consistently purified from the liver and spleen of affected rabbits, the characteristics of which have been described by several investigators (Du et aI., 1986 , 1991~Xu et ai., 1988~Xu and Chen, 1989~Smid et af., 1989~Ohlinger and Theil, 1991~Xu, 1991~Liebermann et ai., 1992 .

The virus has been reported to be a picornavirus , calicivirus (Smid et ai., 1989~Valicek et ai., 1990~Rodak et aI., 1990b~Ohlinger et aI., 1990~Parra and Prieto, 1990~Ohlinger and Theil, 1991~Liebermann et aI., 1992 , or parvovirus (Xu et al., 1988~Gregg and House, 1989H ouse et ai., 1990~Du, 1990 , 1991~Xu, 1991~Gregg et al., 1991 . Hence, the current classification must be considered provisional. Immunoblotting of the virus reveals three major proteins of 38, 52, and 61 kDa, with the latter being dominant (Rodak et aI., 1990a~Ohlinger et ai., 1990~Parra and Prieto, 1990 . Comparison of nucleic acid sequences reveals significant homology with feline calicivirus (Meyers et ai., 1991a,b) . The virus agglutinates erythrocytes of humans and guinea pigs, but not rabbits.\n\nThe virus is highly stable in the environment~viral infectivity is unaffected by treatment with ether, chloroform, exposure to pH 3, or heating at 50\u00b0C. However, the virus is inactivated by 1% sodium hydroxide or 0.4% formaldehyde at ambient temperature, 4\u00b0, or 37\u00b0C. The virus fails to grow in many primary and established cell lines but has been adapted to a transformed rabbit kidney cell line (li et aI., 1991; . Rabbits may be the only species susceptible to infection, as inoculation of guinea pigs, hamsters, rats, or mice failed to in duce disease. Experimentally, inoculation of hares (Lepus europaeus) failed to induce disease .\n\nc. EPIDEMIOLOGY. The disease has been reported from China, Korea, most European countries, and Mexico . Countries experiencing epidemics with high mor bidity and mortality include China , Korea , Italy , Spain , France (Morisse et cd., 1991) , Germany , and Mexico . The disease has also been reported from India and the Mid dle East . Viruses from China, Korea, and Europe appear to be identical .\n\nNo apparent difference in susceptibility to infection among breeds of Oryctolagus cuniculus has been reported . Outbreaks of disease have occurred mainly in rabbits 2 months of age and older, whereas younger rabbits were clinically unaffected. Transmission of virus is hor izontal, by direct contact with secretions and excretions of in fected rabbits. Fecal-oral spread may be the major mode of transmission, but contaminated fomites, including feed, water, utensils, and animal attendants, may also be important modes. There is no evidence of vertical transmission or biological vec tors. Experimentally, the routes of entry, in order of importance, are oral, conjunctival, nasal, and skin trauma. In China and Europe, epidemics of disease usually begin in November and end in March. Although O. cuniculus appears to be the only species susceptible to disease, hares in China also appear to be infected and capable of transmitting the disease to rabbits ex perimentally . A serological survey of 1461 rabbits from 43 farms, apparently free of viral hemorrhagic disease, in Czechoslovakia revealed that 283 rabbits (19%) from 33 farms had antibodies . Using another set of sera, collected between 1975 and 1987 from laboratory-maintained rabbits, antibodies were detected in 32 of 42 sera (76%). This suggests that rabbit colonies in Czechoslovakia harbored a viral agent with characteristics similar to those of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, but with lower pathogenicity, several years before the syndrome was recognized in China. d. CLINICAL SIGNS. In general, the disease is acute and highly infectious, with high morbidity and mortality MarcatO\u00a3?fa/., 1991) . The incubation period ranges from 1 to 2 days. The morbidity rate is 70-80%, and the mortality rate approaches 100%. During outbreaks, the number of rabbits affected usually peaks in 2 to 3 days and lasts 7 to 13 days. After viral introduction, rabbits die suddenly with few clinical signs. Rabbits become febrile and exhibit depres sion, lethargy, and anorexia. Other clinical signs include tachypnea, cyanosis, abdominal distension, and constipation or diar rhea. Because the disease is acute, clinical signs may be brief and often are unnoticed. In the terminal stage, rabbits become hypothermic, recumbent, and have convulsions and epistaxis. Surviving rabbits exhibit depression, anorexia, and fever which usually abates in 2 to 3 days. In endemic areas, the form of disease observed in surviving rabbits is more common. Hematologic evaluation usually reveals a lymphopenia, a gradual decline in thrombocytes, and prolonged prothrombin and thrombin times. A paracoagulation test with protamine sulfate gives a strong positive reaction. Fibrin degradation products can be detected in most moribund rabbits. e. PATHOLOGY.

There is often a segmental catarrhal enteritis.\n\nIn most fatal cases, rabbits die from a severe and massive intravascular coagulopathy . The disease consistently causes acute hepatic necrosis, which may be the only lesion found. Hepatic necrosis is periportal and diffuse and, when severe, may bridge acini. Small single or multiple intranuclear inclusion bodies can be found in degenerate hepatocytes. There is often little inflammation in necrotic areas. Many tissues, especially the lungs, spleen, and kidneys, may have varying degrees of congestion and hemorrhage due to microinfarction or major venous thrombi. Acute coagulative necrosis due to microinfarction may be found in any organ. Microinfarcts in the brain account for the terminal neurological signs. Pulmonary venous thrombosis accounts for the frothy serosanguinous discharge from the nares seen terminally. A segmental necrotizing enteritis with severe crypt necrosis and villous atrophy similar to that seen with canine or feline parvoviral infections can be found .

By electron microscopy, viral particles, 28-34 nm in diameter, frequently are found in hepatocytes . The hemagglutination test, with type O human erythrocytes, is use ful for detection of virus in suspensions of liver, lungs, spleen, and kidneys from infected rabbits. Antisera or monoclonal anti bodies to the virus are useful in detecting virus in hepatocytes of infected rabbits by immunoenzyme assays and immunofluorescence tests Rodak et aL, 1990b . Serological tests include the hemagglutination inhibition test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the latter being pref erable because of increased sensitivity and specificity (Rodak etaL, 1990b) . g. CONTROL. Measures to prevent introduction of the virus include restricted access and disinfection of all equipment en tering or leaving a facility . Cages and equipment can be disinfected with 0.5% sodium hypochlorite or 1% formalin. Rabbits from areas with the disease should not be introduced directly into the colony but should be quarantined for at least 1 month. Similarly, colonies with the disease should be quarantined and depopulated, since surviving rabbits shed virus for at least a month . Tissue-derived vaccines, inactivated with formaldehyde or \u00df-propiolactone (Smid etaL, 1991; Arguello Villares, 1991) , have been shown to be safe and efficacious in preventing dis ease. Resistance develops within 1 to 2 weeks after vaccination and lasts for 5 to 15 months. Although disease may be pre vented in vaccinated rabbits, persistent infection may develop on exposure to the virus . Thus, vaccinated rabbits infected with virus should be considered infectious and should not be introduced into previously unexposed rabbitries. Antiserum is also protective .\n\na. HISTORY. A disease, characterized by hemorrhages in the trachea and lungs, pulmonary edema, and necrotic hepatitis, with high mortality, has been observed since 1980-1985 in Eur opean brown hares (Lepus europaeus) and mountain hares (Lepus timidus) in several European countries . The disease, named European brown hare syndrome, is similar to rabbit hemorrhagic disease.\n\nb. ETIOLOGY. Electron microscopy of hepatocytes from af fected hares reveals nonenveloped, icosahedral particles about 30 nm in diameter . Immunoblotting of the virus reveals a major structural protein of about 60 kDa, similar to rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus; however, other proteins of the latter virus are absent, suggesting that the viruses are similar but not identical (Ohlin ger and Thiel, 1991; Capucci etaL, 1991) . The European brown hare virus fails to grow in primary hare and rabbit cell lines , and inoculation of mice and guinea pigs failed to induce disease . Inoculation of liver homogenates from affected hares into rabbits resulted in a clinical syndrome simi lar to rabbit hemorrhagic disease.

European Brown Hare Virus a. HISTORY. A disease, characterized by hemorrhages in the trachea and lungs, pulmonary edema, and necrotic hepatitis, with high mortality, has been observed since 1980-1985 in European brown hares (Lepus europaeus) and mountain hares (Lepus timidus) in several European countries (Morisse et aI., 1990 (Morisse et aI., , 1991 . The disease, named European brown hare syndrome, is similar to rabbit hemorrhagic disease. b. ETIOLOGY. Electron microscopy of hepatocytes from affected hares reveals nonenveloped, icosahedral particles about 30 nm in diameter Marcato et aI., 1991) . Immunoblotting of the virus reveals a major structural protein of about 60 kDa, similar to rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus; however, other proteins of the latter virus are absent, suggesting that the viruses are similar but not identical (Ohlinger and Thiel, 1991; Capucci et ai., 1991) . The European brown hare virus fails to grow in primary hare and rabbit cell lines , and inoculation of mice and guinea pigs failed to induce disease (Henriksen et ai., 1989) . Inoculation of liver homogenates from affected hares into rabbits resulted in a clinical syndrome similar to rabbit hemorrhagic disease. Tissues from inoculated rabbits exhibited hemagglutination with human type 0 erythrocytes, and similar viral particles were detected by electron microscopy. Antiserum against rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus protected rabbits from mortality, and surviving rabbits had antibodies in the hemagglutination inhibition assay . However, other investigators have failed to induce disease in rabbits with the European brown hare virus (Ohlinger and Thiel, 1991; Capucci et ai., 1991) .\n\nc. EPIDEMIOLOGY. The disease has been reported in wild hares from several European countries, including England , and from breeding farms for hares in Denmark (Henriksen et ai., 1989) and Sweden . In France, Germany, and Italy, the geographic distribution of European brown hare syndrome coincides with viral hemorrhagic disease in wild and.domesticated rabbits (Morisse et aI., 1991; Can-cellotti and Renzi, 1991) . Although systematic studies of the prevalence of infection have not been conducted, sera from most hares contain antibodies to the virus . Young hares are resistant to the virus . The major mode of transmission appears to be fecal-oral spread . Contamination of feed and water with excreta from infected hares is probably a common mode of transmission . Among wild and farmed hares in Denmark and Sweden, mortality is seasonal, beginning in October and continuing through March (Henriksen etai, 1989; Gavier-Widen and Mor ner, 1991) . In England, excessive mortality in wild hares was reported in September through November . d. CLINICAL SIGNS. In general, the disease is acute and highly infectious, with high morbidity and mortality . Clinical signs include de pression, anorexia, muscular tremors, incoordination, paraly sis, convulsions, and occasionally epistaxis. Death occurs 5 to 24 hr after onset of signs, and affected hares rarely recover. The reported morbidity is 75%, and mortality approaches 100% (Henriksen etai, 1989; . e. PATHOLOGY. Death is attributable to multiple organ fail ure resulting from pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, adrenocortical necrosis, renal circulatory disorders, and hepatic necrosis . Gross examination of hares reveals marked pulmonary congestion and edema, as well as hepatic congestion and hemorrhages. Mod erate splenomegaly and gastric ulceration are detected in some hares. A catarrhal to necrotizing conjunctivitis may be present. Microscopically, there is diffuse acute coagulation necrosis of hepatic periportal and midzonal areas, accompanied by forma tion of acidophilic bodies . In many hares, there is basophilic stippling in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes in periportal areas, representing granular calcification. Many livers have microvacuolar fatty degeneration. About one-fourth of affected hares have splenic cellular depletion and hyaline-like changes in the sinuses and cords, and about one-third have renal tubular necro sis and calcification. In the brain, cerebral neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells exhibit granulovacuolar degeneration. In apparently healthy hares with antibodies to the virus, hepatic vacuolar degeneration, tracheitis, and hyperplasia of splenic follicles are observed .\n\nf. DIAGNOSIS. Diagnosis is similar to that for rabbit hem orrhagic disease. The hemagglutination test for detection of vi rus in tissue specimens is less sensitive, possibly owing to the presence of lower concentrations of virus in comparison with rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus . Use of two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), in series, employing monoclonal antibodies, in which the first test detects group antigen and the second virus-specific antigen, has permit ted the detection of European brown hare virus . The ELIS A is preferred for detection of antibodies (Cap ucci et al, 1991) . g. CONTROL. Methods of control in breeding farms for hares are similar to those for rabbit hemorrhagic disease. Pre ventive measures include restricted access, disinfection of equipment, and quarantine of newly acquired hares. As subclinically infected hares may shed virus, serological screening of quarantined hares may be advisable. Only seronegative hares should be permitted entry into the colony. Colonies with the disease should be quarantined and depopulated. No vaccine has been developed for use in hares.\n\nRabbit syncytium virus was isolated in chicken embryos in oculated with extracts of liver and spleen from a wild cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus) in Virginia . The agent causes a cytopathic effect and syncytia in monkey and hamster kidney cell cultures. Experimentally, suckling mice are susceptible to the virus, but weaned mice, guinea pigs, domestic and cottontail rabbits failed to develop signs or le sions, although antibodies developed, following inoculation. Sera from 8 of 25 (32%) cottontail rabbits trapped in the same area as the original rabbit had antibodies to the virus. Antibod ies to the virus were not detected in sera from seven other spe cies trapped in the same area, Oryctolagus cuniculus, or humans. The virus resembles the paramyxoviruses in size, nu cleic acid type, and in ether and heat sensitivity. Hemagglutin ation or hemadsorption was not observed, and the ultrastructure of the virus has not been described. The virus is serologically distinct from the known paramyxoviruses.\n\nEvidence of another paramyxovirus, Sendai virus, has been found in domestic rabbits (O. cuniculus). A serological survey of 23 breeding and laboratory colonies, in metropolitan Tokyo and Ibaragi, Chiba, Saitama, Kanagawa, Shizuoka, and Nagano prefectures, revealed that 85 of 160 (53%) Japanese White or New Zealand White rabbits had antibodies to Sendai virus . also detected antibodies to Sendai virus in rabbit sera in studies comparing antigenic relationships among paramyxoviruses. Intranasal inoculation of O. cuniculus with Sendai virus resulted in infection; rabbits shed virus for 3 to 7 days after inoculation, and viral antigen was detected by immunofluorescence in the nasal cavities . Although rabbits showed no clinical signs and had only a mod erate increase of goblet cells in the nasal epithelium, antibodies to the virus developed. One of three uninoculated rabbits ex posed to inoculated rabbits acquired infection. These studies suggest that O. cuniculus is susceptible to Sendai virus and that this or a related virus may be endemic in rabbit colonies. 196 cellotti and Renzi, 1991) . Although systematic studies of the prevalence of infection have not been conducted, sera from Inost hares contain antibodies to the virus . Young hares are resistant to the virus . The major mode of transmission appears to be fecal-oral spread (Morisse et aI., 1991) . Contamination of feed and water with excreta from infected hares is probably a common mode of transmission .

The agent causes a cytopathic effect and syncytia in monkey and hamster kidney cell cultures. Experimentally, suckling mice are susceptible to the virus, but weaned mice, guinea pigs, domestic and cottontail rabbits failed to develop signs or lesions, although antibodies developed, following inoculation.

Hemagglutination or hemadsorption was not observed, and the ultrastructure of the virus has not been described. The virus is serologically distinct from the known paramyxoviruses.\n\nEvidence of another paramyxovirus, Sendai virus, has been found in domestic rabbits (0. cuniculus). A serological survey of 23 breeding and laboratory colonies, in metropolitan Tokyo and Ibaragi, Chiba, Saitama, Kanagawa, Shizuoka, and Nagano prefectures, revealed that 85 of 160 (53%) Japanese White or New Zealand White rabbits had antibodies to Sendai virus (Iwai et aI., 1986) . also detected antibodies to Sendai virus in rabbit sera in studies comparing antigenic relationships among paramyxoviruses. Intranasal inoculation of O. cuniculus with Sendai virus resulted in infection; rabbits shed virus for 3 to 7 days after inoculation, and viral antigen was detected by immunofluorescence in the nasal cavities (Machii et aI., 1989) . Although rabbits showed no clinical signs and had only a moderate increase of goblet cells in the nasal epithelium, antibodies to the virus developed. One of three uninoculated rabbits exposed to inoculated rabbits acquired infection. These studies suggest that O. cuniculus is susceptible to Sendai virus and that this or a related virus may be endemic in rabbit colonies.\n\nEvidence of infection with several viruses of the genus Bunyavirus in the family Bunyaviridae has been detected in leporids. The viruses (California encephalitis, snowshoe hare, Tahyna, and Inkoo virus) are grouped in the California antigenic group (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 1991). Antibodies to California encephalitis virus were initially de tected in cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) and jackrabbits {Lepus califomicus) in California . The first virus of the group to be recovered from leporids was the snowshoe hare virus, isolated in 1959 from the blood of a sick snowshoe hare {Lepus americanus) in western Mon tana . The virus is widespread in snowshoe hare populations of North America, as serological surveys revealed prevalences of 40 to 97% in adult hares (Newhouse et ai, 1963; Hoff et ai, 1969; . The virus has been isolated from seven species of boreal forest mosquitoes, including 0.04% of Aedes communis (Mc Lean, 1983) , and also from the rabbit tick, Haemaphysalis leporis-palustris (Newhouse et ai, 1963) .\n\nThe European hare {Lepus europeaus) and wild European rabbit {Oryctolagus cuniculus) appear to be the major reservoirs of Tahyna virus in Europe Danielova et ai, 1969; . Clinical disease in infected hares has not been reported. Experimental infection of European rabbits results in viremia and antibody formation without clinical disease Hammon and Sather, 1966) . Thus, domestic rabbits are useful as sentinels of viral activity since they develop antibodies and can serve as a source for recovery of virus McKiel etal, 1966) . A serological survey in Finland revealed that 5% of snow hares {Lepus timidus) and none of the L. europeaus tested had anti bodies against Inkoo virus .\n\nSilverwater virus, a Tospovirus in the family Bunyaviridae, has been isolated from snowshoe hares and from H. leporispalustris ticks from snowshoe hares in Ontario and Alberta . Although no disease has been reported in infected hares, they appear to play a central role in the natural cycle of the virus.\n\nSerological evidence of infection with western and eastern equine encephalitis viruses, alphaviruses in the family Togaviridae (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 1991) has been found in rabbits and hares. Wild Sylvilagus as well as hares {Lepus califomicus and Lepus americanus) have antibod ies to western equine encephalitis virus . Antibodies to eastern equine encephalitis virus have also been detected in snowshoe hares .\n\nAntibodies to St. Louis encephalitis virus, a member of the Japanese encephalitis subgroup in the family Flaviviridae (In ternational Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 1991), have been detected in snowshoe hares {Lepus americanus) (Yuill etal, 1969) .\n\nEvidence of infection with several viruses of the genus Bunyavirus in the family Bunyaviridae has been detected in leporids. The viruses (California encephalitis, snowshoe hare, Tahyna, and Inkoo virus) are grouped in the California antigenic group (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 1991). Antibodies to California encephalitis virus were initially detected in cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) and jackrabbits (Lepus californicus) in California . The first virus of the group to be recovered from leporids was the snowshoe hare virus, isolated in 1959 from the blood of a sick snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) in western Montana (Burgdorfer et aI., 1961) . The virus is widespread in snowshoe hare populations of North America, as serological surveys revealed prevalences of 40 to 97% in adult hares (Newhouse et al., 1963~Yuill et al., 1969~Hoff et al., 1969~McLean et al., 1975 . The virus has been isolated from seven species of boreal forest mosquitoes, including 0.04% of Aedes comlnunis (Mc-Lean, 1983) , and also from the rabbit tick, Haemaphysalis leporis-palustris (Newhouse et aI., 1963) .\n\nThe European hare (Lepus europeaus) and wild European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) appear to be the major reservoirs of Tahyna virus in Europe (Simkova, 1963~Bardos, 1965 , 1975D anielova et al., 1969~Hannoun et aI., 1969 . Clinical disease in infected hares has not been reported. Experimental infection of European rabbits results in viremia and antibody formation without clinical disease (Simkova, 1962~Hammon and . Thus, domestic rabbits are useful as sentinels of viral activity since they develop antibodies and can serve as a source for recovery of virus (Kolman et al., 1966~McKiel et af., 1966 . A serological survey in Finland revealed that 5% of snow hares (Lepus titnidus) and none of the L. europeaus tested had antibodies against Inkoo virus .\n\nSilverwater virus, a Tospovirus in the family Bunyaviridae, has been isolated from snowshoe hares and from H. leporispalustris ticks from snowshoe hares in Ontario and Alberta Larke, 1963~Yuill et al., 1969) . Although no disease has been reported in infected hares, they appear to play a central role in the natural cycle of the virus.\n\nSerological evidence of infection with western and eastern equine encephalitis viruses, alphaviruses in the family Togaviridae (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 1991) has been found in rabbits and hares. Wild Sylvilagus as well as hares (Lepus californicus and Lepus alnericanus) have antibodies to western equine encephalitis virus (Bowers et al., 1969\u1ef8 uill et al., 1969 . Antibodies to eastern equine encephalitis virus have also been detected in snowshoe hares .\n\nAntibodies to St. Louis encephalitis virus, a member of the Japanese encephalitis subgroup in the family Flaviviridae (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, 1991), have been detected in snowshoe hares (Lepus alnericanus) (Yuill et aI., 1969) ."}
