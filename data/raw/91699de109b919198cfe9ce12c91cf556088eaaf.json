{"title": "Rearrangement of Viral Sequences in Cytopathogenic Pestiviruses", "body": "INTRODUCTION Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) represents a small enveloped RNA virus that belongs to the genus pestivirus within the family Flaviviridae (Wengler, 1991) . Other members of the genus are hog cholera virus (HCV) and border disease virus (BDV) of sheep. The single-stranded RNA genome of pestiviruses has a size of about 12.5 kb and possesses positive polarity (Renard et a/., 1987; Collett et a/., 1988a; Meyers et al., 1989a) . Viral gene expression occurs via synthesis of a polyprotein and subsequent proteolytic processing (Collett et al., 1988b,c; Meyers et al., 1989a) .\n\nBVDV is the causative agent of a variety of syndromes in cattle among which the most severe is mucosal disease (MD) with almost 100% lethality (for review: Baker, 1987) . Interestingly, a pair of viruses belonging to two different biotypes of BVDV can always be isolated from animals which come down with MD. These two biotypes are distinguished by their ability to replicate in tissue culture cells with or without cytopathic effect (cpBVDV or noncpBVDV, respectively). Elaborate studies revealed that a prerequisite for development of MD is an intrauterine infection with noncpBVDV (Brownlie et a/., 1984; Bolin et a/., 1985) . In a second step generation of cpBVDV occurs, which ' To whom correspondence and reprint requests should be addressed.\n\nSequence data from this article have been deposited with Gen-Bank/EMBL Data Libraries under accession Nos. M96640 (Fig. 3A) , M96641 (Fig. 3B) , M96638 (Fig. 3C) , and M96639 (Fig. 4) . was assumed to be due to a mutation in the viral genome (Pocock et al., 1987; Corapi et al., 1988) .\n\nAt the molecular level the only difference between cpBVDV and noncpBVDV known until recently was the presence of an 80-kDa protein (~80) in cells infected with cytopathogenic viruses. This protein is colinear with the carboxyterminal part of a polypeptide of 125 kDa (~125) detectable in cells infected with either cpBVDV or noncpBVDV (Purchio et a/., 1984; Pocock et a/., 1987; Corapi et a/., 1988; Collett et al., 1988b) . Surprisingly, for two cpBVDV strains host cell-derived insertions were detected within the genomic region coding for ~125 (Meyers et al., 1989b (Meyers et al., , 1990 . One of the inserted sequences codes for a complete ubiquitin-like protein while the function of the cellular homologue of the other insertion is still unknown (Meyers et a/., 1989b (Meyers et a/., , 1990 . We proposed that recombination between cellular and viral RNA led to the formation of these cpBVDV genomes and that the insertion of cellular elements is linked to generation of p80 within the infected cells (Meyers et a/., 1990) .\n\nTo investigate directly the difference between a cytopathogenic virus and its noncytopathogenic counterpart we analyzed the genomes of a pair of cpBVDV (CPl) and noncpBVDV (NCPl) isolated from one MD animal. For CPl a ubiquitin-coding element which is embedded in a large duplication of viral sequences encompassing the p80-coding region was identified. In contrast, the genome of NCPl does not contain either insertion or duplication . According to the results of these studies, one possible mutation leading to cytopathogenic BVDV is a recombina-tion process between cellular and viral RNA. In this report molecular characterization of two additional pairs of cpBVDV and noncpBVDV is reported which adds a new aspect to our understanding of generation of cytopathogenic BVDV.\n\nRestriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were from Pharmacia-LKB (Freiburg, FRG), New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, FRG), Boehringer-Mannheim (Mannheim, FRG), and Life Sciences, Inc. (USA). Am-pliTaq DNA polymerase was obtained from Cetus-Perkin-Elmer (Langen, FRG). Radioactive compounds were purchased from Amersham-Buchler (Braunschweig, FRG) . Kodak XAR5 X-ray films were used for autoradiography.\n\nMDBK cells and the BVDV strain NADL (Gutekunst and Malmquist, 1963) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The BVDV strain Osloss (Renard et al., 1987) was kindly provided by Dr. Liess (Veterinary School, Hannover, FRG). Isolation and serological characterization of BVDV strains NCPl, CPl, NCPG, and CP6 have been described by Corapi et al. (1988) ; for strains Pe515CP and Pe515NCP, see Brownlie et al. (1984) . Cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and were infected with BVDV as layer cells at 1.5 X 1 O6 per 3.5-cm dish. Cells and virus stocks were tested every 6 to 12 months for the absence of mycoplasma contamination.\n\nPreparation of RNA was done as described (Rumenapf et al., 1989) . Five microgramms of glyoxylated RNA (Maniatis et al., 1989) was separated in phosphate-buffered 1% agarose gels containing 5.5% formaldehyde. An RNAladder(Bethesda Research Laboratories, FRG) served as a size standard. For Northern hybridization the RNA was transferred to Duralon-UV membranes (Stratagene, Heidelberg, FRG) . Membranes were hybridized to the NCPl cDNA probe labeled with 32P by nick translation (Rigby et a/., 1977) (nick translation kit, Amersham-Buchler, Braunschweig, FRG) in 0.5 n/r sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mM EDTA, and 7% SDS at 54\u00b0C. Posthybridization washes were carried out with 40 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mM EDTA and 5% SDS, and 40 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mM EDTA, and lo/o SDS two times each for 30 min at hybridization temperature.\n\nOligonucleotides were synthesized on a Biosearch 8700 DNA synthesizer (New Brunswick Scientific, FRG) using the phosphoamidite method (Beaucage and Caruthers, 1981) . Oligonucleotides BVDV 13, BVDV 14, and PES 9 are described elsewhere .\n\nOIBVD32: AAATCTCTGCTGTACATCGCACATG OIBVD33: GCATCCATCATNCCRTGRAT cDNA synthesis, cloning, and library screening Synthesis of double-stranded cDNA, cloning in X ZAPII (Stratagene, Heidelberg, FRG), and establishment and screening of the phage library using the NCPl cDNA probe was done as described before . Subcloning of cDNA fragments into pBluescript plasmids by in vivo excision was performed as recommended by the supplier (Stratagene, Heidelberg, FRG).\n\nFirst strand cDNA was synthesized as described (RUmenapf et a/., 1989) using oligonucleotide Ol-BVDV33 as primer. For RNA hydrolysis 1 volume of 0.3 M NaOH and $ volumes of 0.03 M EDTA were added and the mixture incubated at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes. After neutralization with f volume of 1 M Tris/HCI (pH 8.0) the volume was adjusted to 100 ~1 and the solution was passed through a Sephadex G50 spun column (Maniatis eta/., 1989) . 1% of the single stranded cDNA served as template for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Buffer conditions for PCR were as described by Jeffreys et a/. (1988) except that the 50 I.CI reaction mixture contained 10% dimethylsulfoxide and 50 pMol of primers 01-BVDV32 and 01-BVDV33. Samples were overlaid with 75 ~1 of paraffin and cycled 30 times for 100 s at 94\"C, 100 s at 50\u00b0C and 200 s at 72\u00b0C in a thermocycler TPS (Landgraf, Hannover, FRG). After purification by chloroform extraction and preparative agarose gel electrophoresis the PCR product was cloned blunt end into the Smal site of pBluescript SK-(Stratagene, Heidelberg, FRG) according to standard procedures (Maniatis et al., 1989) .\n\nExonuclease III and Sl were used to establish deletion libraries of cDNA clones (Hennikoff, 1987) . Dideoxy sequencing (Sanger et a/., 1977) of doublestranded DNA templates was carried out using the T7 polymerase sequencing kit (Pharmacia-LKB). All sequences shown in the figures have been determined from two complementary strands. Computer analysis of sequence data was performed on a Digital Microvax II using the UWGCG software (Devereux et al., 1984) .\n\nPreparation of antisera against bacterial fusion proteins or synthetic peptides For preparation of the anti Dl , anti-K1 , anti-L1 , and antiP sera HCV-derived cDNA fragments coding for amino acids 102-292 (anti-Dl), 2555 -2766 (anti-Kl), 2766 -2985 , and 2290-2555 (anti-Pl) of the HCV polyprotein (Meyers et al., 1989a) were subcloned into the expression vector pEX34 using standard procedures (Maniatis et a/., 1989) . pEX34 is identical to the previously described plasmid pEX31 (Strebel et a/., 1986) except for a deleted Pstl site in the ampicillin resistance gene; expression and enrichment of bacterial fusion proteins were performed basically as described previously (Strebel et al., 1986) . Fusion proteins were further purified by preparative SDS-PAGE and, after electroelution, injected subcutaneously into rabbits with Freund adjuvant (complete for basic immunization, incomplete for booster injections). Preparation of anti-G1 (Rumenapf eta/., 1991) and anti-A3 (Thiel et a/., 199 1) has been reported before.\n\nPeptide HCV-Pep14 was synthesized on a MilliGen 9050 PepSynthesizer (Millipore) by using the Fmocpolyamide method. For generation of antibodies the peptide was coupled to Key Hole Limpet hemocyanin using glutaraldehyde as crosslinker (Harlow and Lane, 1988) . Immunization of rabbits was carried out as described above with an equivalent of 1 mg of peptide per injection.\n\nThe antiserum against the peptide corresponding to amino acids 1335-l 351 of the BVDV NADL ORF has been described before (Collett et al., 1991) .\n\nBVDV-infected MDBK cells (1.5 X 1 O6 per 3.5-cm dish) were labeled for 6 hr with 0.5 mCi/ml\n\nLabeling medium contained no cysteine and & of normal methionine content. Cell extracts were prepared under denaturing conditions (Harlow and Lane, 1988) . Extracts were incubated with 5 ~1 of undiluted serum. Precipitates were formed with crosslinked Staphylococcus aureus (Kessler, 1981) analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and processed for fluorography using Enhance (New England Nuclear, Boston). Competition for anti-peptide antisera was done with 100 pg of peptide per RIP sample. . Osloss represents a cpBVDV strain with a genome containing a ubiquitin-coding insertion of 228 nucleotides (Meyers er al., 1989b) .\n\nCharacterization of the first BVDV pair isolated from one animal with MD revealed a striking difference between the genome sizes of the cytopathogenic virus CPl and the noncytopathogenic virus NCPl which was clearly detectable on Northern blots (Meyers eta/., 1991) . The analysis of the viruses belonging to pairs Pe515 (Pe515CP and Pe515NCP) and No. 6 (CP6 and NCPG) was also started with Northern hybridization experiments (Fig. 1) . The cDNA insert from clone pNCII.1 was used as a probe which was hybridized against total RNA from bovine kidney (MDBK) cells infected with different virus strains. The migration rate determined for the genome of the cytopathogenic member of each virus pair was considerably slower than that of the noncytopathogenic counterpart ( Fig. 1) . Among the cpBVDV strains analyzed here CP6 apparently possesses the largest genome while the RNA from Pe515CP has about the same size as that of the CPl genome (Fig. 1 According to additional hybridization experiments with a ubiquitin probe the viruses from pairs No. 6 and Pe515 did not contain ubiquitin-coding sequences in their genomes while those from BVDV Osloss and CPl were clearly recognized (data not shown). Therefore the putative recombination leading to the genomes of BVDV CP6 and Pe515CP did not imply integration of ubiquitin-coding sequences.\n\nFor elucidation of the genome structure of BVDV Pe515CP and Pe515NCP cDNA cloning and sequencing was employed. Since all insertions identified so far in BVDV genomic RNAs were located around nucleotide 5400, construction of the cDNA library was performed with primers specific for the regions at 6 and 7 kb . The library screening was done with the same probe as used for the blot in Fig. 1 . In order to investigate the genomic localization of the respective cDNA fragment, BVDV-specific cDNA clones were first analyzed by determination of the terminal sequences (Fig. 2) . With respect to the published BVDV genomic sequences the 5' ends of clones pCB32 and pCB38 corresponded to positions around 7662 and 5529, while the 3'ends were homologous to sequences upstream of nucleotides 9814 and 6166 (pCB32 and pCB38, respectively). Accordingly, the expected sizes of the cDNA inserts in clones pCB32 and pCB38 are 2.15 and 0.64 kb, respectively. This finding already indicated the presence of sequence rearrangements in the genome of Pe515CP since the observed length of the cloned cDNAfragments was about 4.9 kb (pCB32) and 3.4 kb (pCB38) (Fig. 2) . To determine the genome organization of Pe5 15CP additional nucleotide sequencing of both pCB32 and pCB38 was employed (indicated by arrows in Fig. 2 ). The 5'end of the sequence shown in Fig. 3 corresponds to position 7089 of the published BVDV NADL genomic sequence (Collett et a/., 1988a) . Up to nucleotide 636 the determined Pe515CP sequence is colinear with the published sequences. Then 462 residues follow which do not show any homology to the respective BVDV genomic region. The third part of the sequence corresponds to the region following position 5423 of the BVDV genome (strain NADL) (Fig. 3A) . In general this genome organization is reminiscent of the one described for BVDV CPl with an insertion flanked by a duplicated viral sequence encompassing about 2.5 kb downstream of position 5423 (termed LD) (Fig. 5 ). For BVDV CPl the inserted element of 366 residues was a host cell-derived sequence coding for ubiquitin. Surprisingly, the 462 nucleotides present in the genome of Pe515CP (termed SD) are not of cellular origin but are homologous to the sequence located at position 428-889 of the BVDV NADL genome (Figs. 3A and 5). Accordingly, the genome of BVDV Pe515CP represents the product of a recombination process which probably involved only viral sequences.\n\nThe differences in genome sizes observed in the Northern blot experiments ( Fig. 1 ) suggested that the duplication and rearrangement of sequences identified for Pe515CP are not present in the RNA of Pe51 SNCP. To investigate this directly a cDNA library of Pe515NCP was established using a primer complementary to a sequence located at about 9 kb in a standard BVDV genome (Pes9). Priming in this region should provide cDNA clones encompassing the two recombination positions identified for Pe515CP (for nucleotide positions see Fig. 3A ). After screening the library with the pNCPII.1 probe clone pNCB3 was isolated which had a size of about 3.9 kb (Fig. 2) . Determination of the terminal sequences allowed the positioning of the cDNA insert between nucleotides 4886 and 9048 with respect to the BVDV NADL genome. with respect to a standard pestivirus genome were not observed. Thus the cytopathogenic and the noncytopathogenic viruses of BVDV pair Pe515 differ dramatically in their genome organization (Fig. 5) .\n\nComparison of the sequences determined for the regions upstream of position 636 and downstream of nucleotide 1098 in the Pe515CP cDNA (numbers refer to Fig. 3A ) with the respective parts of the noncpBVDV sequence revealed 99% identity (Table 1 ). Since this value is much higher than the homology to any of the other analyzed BVDV strains this result supports the hypothesis that the cytopathogenic viruses represent mutants of noncp viruses generated by a recombination process.\n\nTo investigate whether a translocation or duplication is responsible for the presence of the SD element in the analyzed part of the Pe515CP genome the 5' region of the viral RNA was looked at. We performed cDNA synthesis with an oligonucleotide primer which is complementary to nucleotides 1355 to 1374 of the published BVDV NADL sequence (OIBVD33). The singlestranded cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification; OIBVD33 and OIBVD32, the latter corresponding to position 364 to 388 of the NADL genome, served as primers. After cloning the resulting PCR fragment into pBluescript the nucleotide sequence of the resulting cDNA fragment was determined (Fig. 3C ) and found to be colinear with the respective region of the BVDV NADL genome. The nucleotide sequence homology between the PCR fragment derived from the 5' end of the genome and the SD element identified in the cDNA clones pCB32 and pCB38 (Fig. 3A) is 97%; the deduced amino acid sequence is 95% identical (Table  2) . Accordingly, the SD element is itself present in duplicate in the BVDV Pe515CP genome. Because of the high homology between each set of duplicated sequences (Tables 1 and 2 ) it can be concluded that they all originated from RNA molecules derived from just one BVDV strain, namely Pe515NCP.\n\nThe Northern blot analysis indicated that the CP6 genomic RNA is larger than that of any pestivirus ana-lyzed so far (Fig. 1) . On the account of the molecular characterization of BVDV CPl and Pe515CP it was expected that a duplication of viral sequences was at least in part responsible for this increase in genome size. Following the strategy outlined above cDNA cloning was performed. The terminal sequences of the insert from plasmid pCP6/10 corresponded to positions 438 and 10851 of the BVDV NADL sequence and those from plasmid pCPG/N to 6877 and 8026 (Fig. 2) . Since the inserts of the two cDNA clones had sizes of 5.8 and 5.3 kb (pCPG/lO and pCPG/N, respectively) this finding strongly indicated rearranged viral sequences. For further investigation, part of pCPG/lO and pCPG/N was sequenced (Figs. 2 and 4) . The first 1188 determined nucleotides are colinear with the BVDV NADL sequence from 7869 to 9057. The following 507 residues again represent a sequence derived from the 5' part of a standard pestivirus genome. The 5'end of this element corresponds to position 383 of the NADL genome, thereby starting 3 nucleotides upstream of the viral translational initiation codon. Interestingly, the 3' end of this inserted element is exactly the same as that of the Pe515CP SD sequence (corresponds to nucleotide 889 in the NADL genome) (Figs. 3A, 4, and 5). For both viruses the region downstream of this 5'-derived element is homologous to the sequence starting with nucleotide 5423 of the NADL genome.\n\nFor Pe515CP the large duplicated element encompasses 2304 nucleotides thus being 81 residues shorter than that of BVDV CPl . The respective element in the CP6 genome, however, has a size of 3635 nucleotides since it corresponds to nucleotides 5423 to 9057 of the BVDV NADL genome. Because of this large duplication together with the SD element of 507 nucleotides the CP6 genome is 4142 nucleotides longer than that of a noncytopathogenic BVDV strain.\n\nAs a marker characteristic for infection with cpBVDV a protein of 80 kDa (~80) has been described (Purchio Donis and Dubovi, 1987a,b; Pocock et al., 1987) . p80 is structurally and antigenically related to a protein of 125 kDa (~125) which represents a nonstructural protein present both in cells infected with cpBVDV and noncpBVDV. For the cpBVDV strains NADL and Osloss it was shown that p80 represents a carboxyterminal cleavage product of ~125 (Collett et al., 1988; Meyers et al., 1991) . The aminoterminal parts resulting from ~125 processing were shown to have sizes of 54 kDa (~54) and 41 kDa (~41) (NADL and Osloss, respectively). A protein equivalent to p54 or p41 could not be demonstrated after infection with BVDV CPl while p80 was clearly detectable. Since the duplicated region in the CPl genome encompasses the putative p80-coding region we reasoned that p80 was expressed from the duplicated sequence and was not generated by cleavage of ~125 (Meyers et al., 199 1) . To detect the respective protein(s) after infection with BVDV Pe515CP and BVDV CP6, radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) was performed.\n\nTwo antisera directed against different regions of ~125 were employed. One of these reagents is di-rected against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 1335 to 1351 of the BVDV NADL open reading frame (anti-l 335) (Collett et a/., 1991) . This antiserum recognizes ~125 from different BVDV strains as well as p54 and p41 from BVDV NADL and Osloss, respectively. Antibodies prepared against a bacterial fusion protein served for demonstration of p80 (antiA3) . After infection of MDBK cells with the four BVDV strains both antisera precipitated ~125 (Fig. 6A, lanes  l-8) . An additional band of 80 kDa could be detected for the cytopathogenic viruses Pe515CP and CP6 in experiments with the antiA serum (Fig. 6A, lanes 3  and 7, respectively) . Importantly, a protein corresponding to p54 of NADL or p41 of Osloss could not be precipitated by the anti-l 335 serum (Fig. 6A, lanes 2,  4, 6, and 8 ). Since ~125 is clearly recognized by the same antibodies, it can be concluded that cleavage of ~125 does not occur after infection with the analyzed viruses. As already proposed for BVDV CPl , the 80-kDa protein of BVDV Pe515CP and CP6 is most likely encoded by the downstream LD regions of these cpBVDV genomes (see below).\n\nAs a consequence of recombination reactions the genomes of BVDV CPl , Pe515CP, and CP6 contain duplicated and rearranged sequences. In all these cases the genomic region coding for ~125 is affected. However, the changes identified at the genome level seem not to result in expression of aberrant ~125, since the respective protein from the cpBVD viruses perfectly comigrates with that from the noncp viruses ( Fig. 6A and Meyers et al., 1991) . Accordingly, the 5' recombination point should be located downstream of the carboxyterminal processing site of ~125 thereby allowing expression of this protein from the sequences upstream of the SD element. In this case aberrant protein(s) could be translated from the region downstream of the ~125 gene. To investigate this hypothesis for BVDV Pe515CP RIP with different antisera, specific for the respective sequences, was performed. In addition, antibodies were included which are directed against the protein encoded by the SD-specific genomic region.\n\nThe SD region in the Pe515CP genome corresponds to codons 15-l 68 of the viral ORF. Therefore antisera directed against the first 55 amino acids of the pestiviral polyprotein (antiG1) and against residues 102-292 (antiD1) were employed (Thiel eta/., 1991) . AntiGl was shown to precipitate a protein of about 20 kDa from BVDV NADL-infected cells (~20) which represents the first protein of the BVDV ORF . For antiD precipitation of two proteins, namely p20 and the pestiviral core protein ~14, has been reported . In addition to these proteins antiG1 and anti Dl precipitated a protein of 28 kDa HCVPep14 (lanes 1,2,7.8) , anti-G1 (lanes 3 and 5), and anti-D1 (lanes 4 and 6). For lanes 2 and 8 100 pg of peptide HCVPep14 were added as competitor to the immunoprecipitation reaction. The position of proteins ~10, ~14, and p20 is indicated. p28 is marked by a triangle.\n\n(~28) from extracts of BVDV Pe515CP-infected cells amino acids 2290 to 2555 (antiP1) or 2555 to 2766 (Fig. 68, lane 1 and 2, respectively) . For further investi-(antiK1) or 2766 to 2985 (antiLl) of the HCV ORF. For gation three antisera specific for the region following BVDV NADL it has been reported that downstream of ~125 in the pestiviral polyprotein were used; they were the ~125 gene a protein of 10 kDa (~10) is encoded prepared against bacterial fusion proteins containing while for the following nearly 1 kb no translation prod-uct except for a short-lived precursor of 42 kDa was found (Collett et al., 1991) . A stable polypeptide of 30 kDa (~30) could, however, be demonstrated for HCV and different BVDV strains with antiP and antiK1 (Stark and Thiel, unpublished) . By using these antisera, p30 was also precipitated from extracts of Pe515CPinfected cells (Fig. 6B, lanes 5 and 6) . The antiP serum also recognized p10 since the bacterial fusion protein employed for generation of this antiserum overlaps the respective region of the polyprotein (Fig. 6B,  lane 6) . Importantly, the antiP serum precipitated an additional antigen which comigrated with the 28-kDa protein described above and presumably represents the same polypeptide (Fig. 6B, lane 6) . Since p28 reacted with antiG1 and antiD as well as with antiP but not with antill or antiK1 (Fig. 6B, lanes 1, 2, 6 ,4, 5, respectively) this polypeptide most likely represents a fusion protein containing sequences from p20 as well as ~10.\n\nAccording to the hypothesis presented above p28 should be specific for Pe515CP. To investigate this more closely, RIP with extracts from cells infected with either the cytopathogenic virus (Fig. 6C, lanes 1-4) or the noncytopathogenic virus (Fig. 6C, lanes 5-8) was performed. In addition to antiG1 (lanes 3 and 5) and antiD (lanes 4 and 6) a serum specific for p10 (an-tiHCVPep14, prepared against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 2309-2325 of the HCV ORF) was employed. While ~20, ~14, and pl0 can easily be demonstrated for both viruses p28 is only precipitated from extracts of Pe515CP-infected cells. In conclusion, the rearranged genome of Pe5 15CP leads to expression of at least two proteins which are not found in cells infected with Pe515NCP, namely p80 and ~28.\n\nThe carboxyterminal end of the Pe515CP fusion protein is generated by autoproteolytic cleavage\n\nThe SD sequences integrated between the LD elements in the genomes of BVDV Pe515CP and CP6 are derived from a region of the viral RNA which has been shown to code for ~20, the first protein of the BVDV ORF (Collett et a/., 1988b; Thiel et al., 1991) . Because of the rapid liberation of this polypeptide during translation which can also be observed in vitro, it has been proposed, that p20 represents an autoprotease (Wiskerchen eta/., 1991; Thiel eta/., 1991) . Recentlyexperimental evidence has been obtained for this theory (Wiskerchen eta/., 1991; Stark eta/., unpublished) . The sequence tryptophane-valine (position 164/l 65) has been proposed as the cleavage recognition site of this enzyme (Wiskerchen eta/., 1991) . Since the conserved 3' end of the SD elements maps to codon 168 of the BVDV ORF the putative cleavage signal is also duplicated and transferred to the downstream position. Ac- . Demonstration of autoproteolytic processing by the BVDV p20 protease. The products of in vitro translation of RNA transcribed from the linearized plasmids pCBP6 (lanes 1, 2, 3) and pCB32 (lanes 4, 5, 6) were precipitated with the sera antiG1 (lanes 1 and 4) an-tiDl* (lanes 2 and 5) and antiG40 (lanes 3 and 6) (for designation of antisera see Fig. 8 ) and separated by 11% SDS-PAGE. The aminoand carboxy-terminal products of the autoproteolytic cleavage reactions are marked by small and large arrowheads (pCBP6) or open and filled triangles (pCB32), respectively. cordingly, for BVDV Pe515CP and CP6 the aminoterminus of p80 could be generated in an autoproteolytic cleavage reaction executed by the preceding p20 protease. For BVDV CP6 the SD sequence covers the complete p20-coding region. In the case of Pe515CP, however, the aminoterminal 14 amino acids of the protease molecule are missing in the downstream SD element. To analyze whether this aminoterminally truncated enzyme is active, in vitro studies were performed. Clone pCB32 was linearized with Hindlll and used as template for in vitro transcription. The synthesized RNA contains an AUG suitable for translation initiation at position 94-96 (position 598-600 in Fig. 3A ). In order to provide a control for the cleavage reaction, clone pCBP6 which contains the I-kb PCR fragment encompassing the complete p20-coding region from the 5' part of the Pe5 15CP genome was also used for in vitro transcription.\n\nTranslation of the resulting RNA should start at the original initiation codon of the viral ORF (position 23-25 in Fig. 3C ). For analysis of the in vitro translation products, RIP with different antisera was performed. Translation of the pCBP6-derived RNA gave the following results: A full-length product of 38 kDa could not be identified (Fig. 7) . Instead, an aminoterminal cleavage product of about 20 kDa was precipitated with antiG1 and antiD (Fig. 7, lanes 1 (Collett et a/., 1991; Stark er a/., unpublished) and the location and designation of bacterial fusion proteins (black bars) and peptides (dots) used for production of the different antisera. For Pe515CP the respective parts of the polyprotein as well as the mature proteins are indicated. The autoproteolytic action of the p20 protease is indicated by a bent arrow. The other cleavages involved in processing of the BVDV polyprotein nonstructural region are carried out by p80 and presumable ~125 (Wiskerthen and Collett, 199 1) (cleavage sites indicated by triangles). respectively). This band most likely represents the autoprotease ~20. Since antiD is directed against amino acids 102 to 292 of the pestiviral ORF, this serum also reacts with the carboxyterminal processing product which has an expected size of about 18 kDa (Fig. 7,  lane 2) .\n\nTranslation of the pCB32-derived RNA again did not result in substantial amounts of the full length product with an expected size of 51 kDa (Fig. 7, lanes 4, 5, 6 ). AntiGl and antiDl* both recognize a predominant band of about 20 kDa, while a serum directed against a bacterial fusion protein encompassing part of p80 (anti-G40, Collett eta/., 1988b) precipitates a protein of about 32 kDa. This finding correlates with a proteolytic cleavage at the predicted site (between amino acids 362 and 363 in Fig. 3A ). Additional experiments with 3' terminally shortened templates revealed that this result is not dependent on the serine protease motif present in the p80 moiety of the protein translated after HindIll digest of pCB32. Analogous results were obtained in reactions with a corresponding cDNA fragment from CP6 (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that the transferred element composed of protease and cleavage site is indeed functional, leading to an autoproteolytical removal of the fusion protein from the following p80 region (Fig. 8) .\n\nThe generation of cytopathogenic BVDV within a calf persistently infected with noncytopathogenic virus re-suits in development of mucosal disease and death of the animal (Brownlie et a/., 1984; Bolin et a/., 1985) .\n\nThe discovery of host cell-derived insertions in the genomes of two cpBVDV strains (Osloss and NADL) led us to propose a recombination as mechanism for development of cpBVDV (Meyers et al., 1989b (Meyers et al., , 1990 . Clear evidence for this model was gained by analysis of a BVDV pair consisting of the viruses CPl and NCPl. The genome of CPl contains a ubiquitin-coding sequence which is flanked by a large duplication of viral sequences. Neither insertion nor duplication are present in the respective part of the NCPl genome. However, the two viruses exhibit 99.6% of sequence identity within corresponding regions of their genomes .\n\nThe data presented in this report broaden the proposed model. In the case of BVDV Pe515CP and CP6 no host cell-derived insertion could be identified. However, elaborate duplication and rearrangement of viral sequences were found for both genomes. The analysis of the noncp virus (Pe515NCP) revealed that neither duplication nor rearrangement of sequences are present, and thus supported the linkage between recombination and establishment of the cytopathogenic phenotype. Accordingly, generation of cpBVDV is not restricted to recombination between cellular and viral sequences but can also be achieved by mere rearrangement of viral sequences.\n\nUntil now recombination-induced changes at the genome level have been identified for 6 cpBVDV strains. Three of these viruses contain ubiquitin-coding insertions, namely BVDV Osloss, CPl , and CP14 (manuscript in preparation for the latter), while the NADL strain has integrated another cellular sequence. The other two, Pe515CP and CP6, have been generated in a recombination process involving only viral sequences. On the basis of PCR analyses it has been found that the genomes of several cpBVDV strains including Pe515CP do not contain insertions within the ~125 gene (DeMoerlooze et al., 1990) . For Pe515CP, this finding describes only one feature of the respective genomic region. The viral RNA contains a ~125 gene without insertion but nevertheless it represents the product of a recombination which affected pl25-coding sequences. Since part of the pl25-coding region has been duplicated the respective rearrangement in the Pe515CP RNA could not be detected by a simple PCR assay.\n\nThe situation is different for some cpBVDV laboratory strains, like Singer, Oregon, and Danmark. None of these strains has a genome size indicating duplications (G. Meyers, unpublished) . The PCR analysis revealed that the region around position 5400 of the BVDV Singer genome does not contain an insertion (DeMoerlooze et a/., 1990). After conventional cDNA cloning and sequencing of about 2 kb derived from the respective genomic region the same result was obtained for the strains Oregon and Danmark (G. Meyers, unpublished) . More elaborate cloning and sequencing is necessary to identify the genetic basis for generation of ~80 and the establishment of a cytopathogenic phenotype by these viruses.\n\nRecombination at the RNA level has been observed for several RNAviruses. Template switching of the viral polymerase during replication or transcription has been proposed as a mechanism for these reactions (Lazzarini et al., 1981; Lai et a/., 1985; Kirkegaard and Baltimore, 1986; Makino et al., 1986; King et a/., 1987; and Khatchikian et al., 1989) . Based on this hypothesis a model for the generation of the cpBVDV genomic RNAs has been put forward which includes two subsequent switches (Meyers eta/., 1991) . Since the cellular mRNAs which serve as templates for integration of, e.g., ubiquitin-coding sequences, are present in the \"sense\" orientation in the cell and in the viral genome, the recombination should occur during synthesis of negative strand viral RNA. Interestingly, the 3' recombination position was the same for the genomes of CPl and Osloss and it was obvious to look for sequences responsible for this site specificity. Two different bovine polyubiquitin mRNAs were analyzed but no homology or complementarity between the sequences flanking the putative recombination positions in the viral and cellular RNAs could be identified . The same result was obtained when the nucleotides adjacent to the SD and LD regions of BVDV Pe515CP and CP6 were analyzed. Surprisingly, sequence comparison revealed identical 3' recombination positions regardless whetherviruses with ubiquitin-coding insertions or duplication of p20-and p80-coding sequences were looked at (Fig. 9) . It therefore has to be considered that the site-specific recombination observed for these viruses might be a result of functional pressure rather than being guided by specific sequences. This functional pressure could be based on the requirement of a given aminoterminus for the cpBVDV-specific protein ~80. Accordingly, development of a cytopathogenie virus in conjunction with outbreak of MD would represent the final step with regard to selection for the correct recombinant. Studies on coronaviruses tend to support this view since selection for certain recombination hotspots is preceded by random RNA recombination (Banner and Lai, 1991) .\n\nThe genome rearrangements which have been identified for the different cpBVDV strains result in changes of virus-encoded proteins. One of these changes represents the expression of aberrant fusion proteins composed of(i) cellular and viral sequences (NADL p54 and Osloss ~41) or (ii) sequences from two viral polypeptides derived from different regions of the genome (Pe515CP) (Fig. 8) . For BVDV CP6 a fusion protein could so far not be demonstrated. This might either be due to a technical problem or to rapid degradation of the respective product which according to the genome organization of CP6 should be composed of p20 sequences and a small part of ~58, the second last polypeptide encoded by the pestiviral ORF (Collett et a/., 1991) . Further investigation is needed to clarify this point.\n\nThe other important change at the protein level distinguishing cpBVDV from noncpBVDV is the expression of ~80 in addition to ~125. While the above-mentioned fusion proteins show a high degree of variability concerning nature and size, not only the mere presence of ~80 in cpBVDV-infected cells but also its size is strictly conserved (Purchio et al., 1984; Donis and Dubovi, 1987a; Greiser-Wilke et al., 1992; Meyers et a/., unpublished) . A prerequisite for generation of ~80 is the introduction of a protease cleavage site at the aminoterminus of this protein. Based on our current knowledge two basically different ways can be distinguished. One possibility is represented by the Osloss strain where the signal for cleavage is provided by a cellular ubiquitin sequence inserted into the ~125 region of the viral polyprotein. Ubiquitin itself is synthesized within eucaryotic cells in form of fusion proteins which are subsequently cleaved at the carboxyterminal end of the ubiquitin moiety (Finley et al., , 1989 azkaynak et a/., 1987; Redmann and Rechsteiner, 1989, Rechsteiner, 1987) . Accordingly, the insertion of ubiquitin into ~125 introduces a signal for processing by a cellular protease (manuscript in preparation).\n\nThe second way to generate ~80 requires duplication of the respective coding region. In addition a processing signal is placed in front of the duplicated sequence. In the case of CPl ubiquitin provides again the signal for cleavage by a cellular protease (manuscript in preparation). For Pe515CP and CP6 a processing site already present in the virus serves this purpose. Interestingly, insertion of the p20-coding region also transfers the protease responsible for the cleavage to its point of action. The integration of both protease and cleavage site might be necessary because of the lack of in vans action of the p20 protein. This would be in accordance with the hypothesis that p20 can only act as an autoprotease .\n\nBoth alternatives outlined above would allow identical aminoterminal ends of the different p80 proteins since the insertion point for the ubiquitin gene in the Osloss RNA and the 5' end of the LD region in the LD/SD type of genomes correspond to the same genomic position. Even though further investigation is necessary to fully understand the generation of ~80, one has to keep in mind that expression of this protein is strictly correlated with the cytopathogenic phenotype and the development of MD. p80 therefore represents the prime candidate for the agent responsible for killing the infected cells while the different fusion proteins might be only byproducts resulting from the recombination. According to sequence comparison studies p80 contains protease as well as helicase motifs (Gorbalenya et a/., 1989a,b). Experimental evidence for the protease function of p80 has recently been obtained Tautz et a/., in preparation) . If p80 turns out to be required for the cytopathogenic effect it will be interesting to determine why ~125, having the same enzymatic domains, does not exhibit this effect.\n\nThe BVDV/MD system offers the opportunity to study RNA virus evolution in action. Development of MD appears to be obligatorily linked to generation of cpBVDV. The required recombination process leads to expression of novel proteins, especially ~80. The analysis of additional virus pairs will provide insights into the different possibilities to generate viruses with a given phenotype."}
