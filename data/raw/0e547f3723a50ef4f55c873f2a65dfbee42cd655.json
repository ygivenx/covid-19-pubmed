{"title": "Protocol for Metagenomic Virus Detection in Clinical Specimens Technical Appendix Protocol for Unbiased Virus Detection and Increasing the Signal-to-Noise Ratios for Metagenomics Ethics Statement", "body": "(10 \u22121 -10 \u22129 ) plus 1 negative control (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] ) were inoculated into the allantois sac (T3/Bat/Germany/342/08, flu A PR/8/1934, and SeV) or directly onto the chorioallantoic membrane (vaccinia virus) of the embryonated chicken eggs as described (2) .\n\nEggs were incubated for 7 days after infection, and survival of the embryo was monitored by candeling. Development of the embryos was terminated at day 17 of embryonation by cooling the eggs overnight at 4\u00b0C. Organs (liver, lungs, kidney, spleen, intestine, heart, and gut) were extracted, and each organ was washed in PBS before homogenization.\n\nA tissue cube with an average size of 8 mm 2 was homogenized in 1 mL PBS by using a FastPrep Homogenizer (MP Biomedicals, Strasbourg, France). A total of 0.2 mL of each organ was extracted by using a NucleoSpin RNA II Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany) without DNA digestion before elution in 60 \u00b5L RNAse-free water. cDNA synthesis was accomplished by using a TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Specific quantitative PCRs (Table 4 in main text) were used for detection of all 4 viruses and a host-specific housekeeping gene (galTBP) (2) . PCRs were performed as described (1) . Extracted organ tissues were pooled according their viral load ( Table 2 in main text). The pooled organ mixture was vortexed vigorously and divided into 150 aliquots (200 \u00b5L/aliquot). These aliquots were chronologically numbered from 1 to 150 and stored at -80\u00b0C until used.\n\nTo test different homogenization strategies, 5 aliquots (200 \u00b5L/aliquot) of model tissue were processed and extracted. An additional control aliquot was extracted at the same time. \n\nUltracentrifugation Different centrifugation techniques were tested in 9 experiments. Control factors were the concentration of sucrose (0%, 30%, and 50%); centrifugation speed (15,000 rpm, 25,000 rpm, and 32,000 rpm in an ultracentrifuge); and duration of centrifugation (1 h, 2 h, and 3 h). In addition, 1 sample was centrifuged a second time (30,000 rpm for 1 h). All samples, except 1, were centrifuged (1,000 rpm for 10 min) before ultracentrifugation. We tested increasing the delta value between virus and host nucleic acids. The optimal combination was found to be 30% of sucrose, 2 h of centrifugation at 15,000 rpm or 35,000 rpm. Results of quadratic loss functions and signal-to-noise ratios are available on request. The second ultracentrifugation provided useful results. The optimal parameters (2 ultracentrifugations) were supported by a confirmation experiment and were subsequently used as part of the protocol ( Figure 5 of main text).\n\nComparative clear centrifugation was used. For paramyxovirus (SeV) and influenza virus (A/PR8/1934), the signal-to-noise ratio was increased. but also reduced the amount of virus nucleic acids and was therefore not used.\n\nTo evaluate different approaches for nucleic acid extraction, we compared the following Results were analyzed regarding their capability to increase the signal-to-noise ratio between virus and host nucleic acids in comparison to our standard kit (NucleoSpin RNA II, without DNA digestion). Whenever a DNA extraction was suggested in any of the kits, this step was excluded to prevent digestion of virus nucleic acids. The QiaAmp Ultra Sense Virus Kit and the QIAGEN Viral Mini Kit showed the best results within the range of extraction kits.\n\nHowever, the best results for our purpose were shown by extraction using the TRIzol LS.\n\nExtraction results are shown in Figure 6 of main text. We combined extraction with TRIzol LS and the QIAGEN Viral Mini Kit in the overall purification protocol.\n\nDifferent random amplification primer strategies (K primer [6] , 3\u2032-locked primer [7] , and conventional random primers N 10 and N 12 ) were used. These strategies were compared by using 60 \u00b5L of RNA/DNA extracted with the NucleoSpin RNA II Kit (Macherey-Nagel).\n\nFor random cDNA synthesis, 60 \u00b5L of purified RNA/DNA was incubated with 4 \u00b5L (10 \u03bcmol/L) of K random primers (6) However, the amount of generated virus-specific nucleic acids was slightly higher when K primers were used. Thus, because K primers are comparable inexpensive and easier to control than commercial kits, this amplification method was used in the TUViD-VM-protocol.\n\nTo establish a full protocol on the basis of individual experiments, we combined the best methods and tested them with model tissue before evaluating the signal-to-noise ratio. From all single method sets, the best methods were selected and progressively used. The TUViD-TM protocol is shown in Figure 1 of main text. Tested methods were homogenization, filtration, methods for the enrichment of viruses, digestion of background nucleic acids, nucleic acid extraction methods, and random amplification strategies. The different methods tested are described in Table 1 of main text."}
