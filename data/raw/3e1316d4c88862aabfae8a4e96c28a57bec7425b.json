{"title": "Prediction of amino acid pairs sensitive to mutations in the spike protein from SARS related coronavirus", "body": "Although the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has gone after hitting the world for several months, everyone is intuitively expecting the possible return of SARS in the near future, and human logic seems to have such an assumption, i.e. if the SARS would return, it would be another mutated form following its first battle with humans. This is possible because the accumulating evidence shows that there are several mutations in SARS related coronavirus (SARS-CoV). So far 15 point mutations have been documented in SARS-CoV proteins: two in the 221 amino-acid-long membrane glycoprotein [2, 15, 17, 19, 24] , three in the 1255 amino-acid-long spike glycoprotein [2, 15, 17, 24] and ten in the 7073 amino-acid-long replicase polyprotein [2, 8, 11, [15] [16] [17] 24] . Naturally we would expect these three SARS-CoV proteins to have other forms of mutations rather than those documented, and the new mutations would lead to the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment of SARS.\n\nAn intriguing question is whether or not we can predict the new mutations of SARS-CoV. If so, it would be greatly helpful for identification of SARS-CoV, and a great advance in understanding of the evolutionary process in SARS-CoV. Also, it would be useful for studying the mutant patterns in other human coronavirus, which would give us some insight into the mutations in coronavirus.\n\nAmong encoded structural replicase, spike, envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid proteins from human SARS-CoV, the spike protein is incorporated into the viral envelope. The spike proteins of coronaviruses are large, type I membrane glycoproteins that are responsible for both binding to receptors on host cells and for membrane fusion. The spike proteins of some coronaviruses are cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits. S proteins also contain important virus-neutralizing epitopes, and amino acid changes in the spike proteins can dramatically affect the virulence and in vitro host cell tropism of the virus [6, 7, 22] . Still at present it is only the spike glycoprotein, in which a considerable amount of mutations has been documented. Using the Blastp program to align three spike glycoproteins from humans, we find little cue on the likelihood of which amino acid would mutate in SARS spike glycoprotein.\n\nIn the past three years, we have developed two models to analyze the primary structure in proteins [25] conducted a series of studies on mutations in different proteins [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Our studies show there is a clearly probabilistic pattern in the amino acids, which are subject to mutations. In this study, we use our model to analyze two spike glycoproteins from human coronavirus in order to gain the insight on the prediction of amino acid pairs being sensitive to mutations in human SARS-CoV.\n\nThe amino acid sequences of the spike glycoproteins were obtained from the Swiss-Protein data bank [1] . The access number is P59594 for human SARS-CoV with 3 point mutations [2, 15, 17, 24] , P15423 for human coronavirus strain 229E with 38 point mutations [3] [4] [5] 10, 12, [20] [21] [22] [23] and P36334 for human coronavirus strain OC43 with 80 point mutations [10, 13, 14, 18] . In order to determine the amino acid pairs probabilistically sensitive to mutations, we conduct the following calculations [25] , which is briefly described follows with the SARS-CoV spike protein as the example.\n\nThe spike protein from human SARS-CoV consists of 1255 amino acids. The first and second amino acids are considered as an amino acid pair, the second and third as another pair, the third and fourth, until the 1254th and 1255th, thus there are 1254 pairs. Because there are 20 types of amino acids, an amino acid pair can be composed from any of 20 types of amino acids so there are 400 types of theoretically possible amino acid pairs. Again there are 1254 pairs in the spike protein, which are more than 400 types of theoretically possible amino acid pairs, clearly some of 400 types should appear more than once. Meanwhile we may expect that some of 400 types are absent from the spike protein.\n\nSimilarly there are 1172 and 1352 amino acid pairs in the spike proteins from strain 229E and OC43, respectively.\n\nThe randomly predicted frequency is governed by the simple permutation principle [9] . For example, there are 39 arginines (R) and 96 serines (S) in SARS-CoV spike protein, the random frequency of amino acid pair \"RS\" would be 3 (39/1255 \u00d7 96/1254 \u00d7 1254 = 2.983). Actually we can find three \"RS\"s in the spike protein, so the actual frequency of \"RS\" is 3. Hence, we have three relationships between actual and predicted frequencies, i.e. the actual frequency is smaller than, equal to and larger than the predicted frequency, respectively.\n\nAs described in the last section, the predicted frequency of randomly present pair \"RS\" would be 3 and \"RS\" does appear 3 times in the spike protein, so the presence of \"RS\" is randomly predictable.\n\nThere are 84 alanines (A) in SARS-CoV spike protein, the frequency of random presence of \"AA\" would be 6 (84/1255 \u00d7 83/1254 \u00d7 1254 = 5.555), i.e. there would be 6 \"AA\"s in the spike protein. In fact, the \"AA\" appears 10 times in the spike protein, so the presence of \"AA\" is randomly unpredictable. This illustrates the case that the actual frequency of \"AA\" is larger than its predicted frequency. Another case is that the actual frequency is smaller than the predicted one. For example, there are 91 valines (V) in the spike protein and the predicted frequency of \"AV\" is 6 (84/1255 \u00d7 91/1254 \u00d7 1254 = 6.091), whereas the actual frequency is only three.\n\nThere are 11 tryptophans (W) in SARS-CoV spike protein, the frequency of random presence of \"RW\" would be 0 (39/1255 \u00d7 11/1254 \u00d7 1254 = 0.342), i.e. the \"RW\" would not appear in the spike protein, which is true in the real situation. Thus the absence of \"RW\" is randomly predictable.\n\nThere are 99 threonines (T) in SARS-CoV spike protein, the frequency of random presence of \"RT\" would be 3 (39/1255 \u00d7 99/1254 \u00d7 1254 = 3.076), i.e. there would be three \"RT\"s in the spike protein. However, no \"RT\" is found in this protein, therefore the absence of \"RT\" from the spike protein is randomly unpredictable.\n\nA point missense mutation results in two amino acid pairs being substituted by another two. As each pair has its actual and predicted frequencies, the difference between them represents a probabilistic measure for the comparison in substituted and substituting amino acid pairs before and after mutation. After calculating the predicted frequency and comparing with the actual frequency, we can classify the substituted amino acid pairs into the predictable/unpredictable amino acid pairs. Table 1 details the appearance of theoretically possible types of amino acids in three spike proteins, for example, \n\nthe third row shows how many types do not appear. From the viewpoint of amino acid pairs, no matter the length of a protein is, the number of its theoretically possible types cannot be more than 400, and therefore the difference between proteins is either how many types of theoretically possible amino acid pairs appear or how many times a theoretically possible type of amino acid pair repeats or both. Table 1 shows 59, 86 and 66 types are absent from the spike protein of SARS-CoV, strain 229E and strain OC43 (third row in the Table) , respectively. Still Table 1 shows that 76, 78 and 61 types appear once in the spike protein of SARS-CoV, strain 229E and strain OC43 (fourth row in the Table) , respectively, and so on. The absent types include 17 randomly predictable and 42 randomly unpredictable with regard to SARS-CoV spike protein, 37 randomly predictable and 49 randomly unpredictable with regard to strain 229E spike protein, and 12 randomly predictable and 54 randomly unpredictable with regard to strain OC43 spike protein. Still we can classify the present amino acid pairs as randomly predictable and unpredictable with respect to theoretically possible types and pairs, because some theoretically possible types appear many times (from row 5 to row 23 in Table 1 ). The columns 3, 4, 5 and 6 in Table 2 show how many predictable and unpredictable types and pairs in human spike proteins. When corresponding the position of each mutation to predictable pairs and unpredictable pairs, we find that a vast majority of mutations occurs at the unpredictable pairs (columns 7, 8, 9 and 10 in Table 2 ). Fig. 1 shows the ratios of frequency difference (AF\u2212PF) versus mutation number per each type of substituted amino acid pairs in spike proteins. It can be seen that there is a general tendency in the ratios, i.e. the larger the difference, the higher the chance of mutation occurring. Therefore, the difference between actual and predicted frequencies indicates the potential chance of mutation occurring in amino acid pairs. As the point missense mutations substitute one type of amino acid to another one, we can gain some insight into the mutation tendency after comparing the difference between actual and predicted frequencies in substituted and substituting amino acid pairs. For the numerical analysis, we calculate the difference between actual frequency (AF) and predicted frequency (PF) in amino acid pairs before and after mutation, i.e. (AF\u2212PF). For instance, a mutation at position 244 substitutes \"I\" to \"T\" which results in two amino acid pairs \"DI\" and \"IW\" changing to \"DT\" and \"TW\", because the amino acid is \"D\" at position 243 and \"W\" at position 245. The actual frequency and predicted frequency are 7 and 5 for \"DI\", 1 and 1 for \"IW\", 2 and 6 for \"DT\", and 0 and 1 for \"TW\", respectively. Thus, the difference between actual frequency and predicted frequency is 2 with regard to the substituted amino acid pairs, i.e. pairs affected by mutations. Fig. 2 shows the difference between actual and predicted frequencies in both substituted and substituting amino acid pairs in spike proteins. It can be seen that the substituting pairs distribute more centrally and symmetrically than the substituted pairs do. The sum of differences between actual and predicted frequencies is statistically smaller in substituting amino acid pairs than in substituted ones in Table 3 (the Student's t-test, P < 0.05). These statistical differences suggest that the mutations lead to the deduction of difference between actual and predicted frequencies. From a probabilistic viewpoint, this means that the mutations are more likely to occur, and these findings are similar to the results in our recent studies [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . As mentioned in Section 2, the actual frequency can be equal to, larger than or smaller than the predicted frequency. Accordingly we can look at these relationships with respect to the substituted (Table 4 ) and substituting (Table 5) pairs. Table 4 reveals that more than 75% of mutations occur at the pairs, whose actual frequency is larger than their pre- Table 5 Classification of substituting amino acid pairs with respect to mutations in the spike proteins from different human coronaviruses dicted frequency in one or both substituted pairs (the first three rows in unpredictable pairs). Comparing the first three rows with the last two rows in unpredictable pairs, we can see that the mutations are more likely to target the pairs whose actual frequencies are larger than predicted frequencies. Therefore, Table 4 suggests which type of amino acid pairs are more likely to be substituted, i.e. the different sensitivities of amino acid pairs to mutations in spike proteins. Table 5 shows in which types of amino acid pairs the mutations are likely or unlikely to form in spike proteins. We can find that more than 60% of mutations result in one or both substituting pairs whose actual frequencies are smaller than their predicted frequencies. Taking the results in both  Tables 3 and 4 into account, the mutations are likely to attack the pairs whose actual frequencies are larger than their predicted ones and the consequences of mutations are likely to form the pairs whose actual frequencies are smaller than their predicted ones. In such a manner, the mutations reduce the difference between actual and predicted frequencies (Fig. 2) .\n\nIn this study, we have analyzed the amino acid pairs affected by mutations in three spike proteins in order to gain some insight into the possible mutations from SARS-CoV. Firstly, the present results demonstrate that the randomly unpredictable amino acid pairs are more sensitive to the mutations (Table 2) , although these 3 spike proteins are constructed by different types of amino acid pairs which repeat different times (Table 1) . Furthermore, the larger the difference between actual and predicted frequencies is, the higher the chance of mutation occurring is (Fig. 1) . The effect induced by mutations is to reduce the difference between ac-tual and predicted frequencies (Fig. 2) . Finally, the amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are larger than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be targeted by mutations (Table 4) , whereas the amino acid pairs whose actual frequencies are smaller than their predicted frequencies are more likely to be formed after mutations (Table 5 ). These findings are identical to our recently publications [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] .\n\nCombining the results with our previous studies, our model suggests that the mutations go along a pathway, which is probabilistically more likely to occur. As such a pathway is less energy-and time-consuming, in fact, the mutations represent a process of degeneration inducing human diseases. Although this study shows that the mutations in the spike proteins from strains 229E and OC43 go along the direction of degeneration, i.e. the mutations go along a probabilistically easy pathway, the documented evidence in literature still cannot suggest whether or not the mutations belong to degeneration in the spike protein from human SARS-CoV.\n\nIf the potential mutations in the spike protein from SARS-CoV would go along a probabilistically easy pathway, according to the results obtained from our analysis, we should pay more attention to the amino acid pairs with the following characteristics for potential mutations, i.e. the amino acid pairs with large difference between actual and predicted frequencies and their actual frequencies larger than predicted frequencies. Table 6 lists the amino acid pairs with the frequency difference being larger than 3 in spike protein from SARS-CoV, as these amino acid pairs seem to be more vulnerable to mutations (Fig. 1 ). With these sensitive amino acid pairs in mind, we can easily determine their positions. For example, the \"NF\"s are located at positions 129-130, 178-179, 230-231, 304-305, 526-527, 528-529, 699-700, 783-784, 951-952, 1056-1057 and 1090-1091 in spike protein from SARS-CoV. Moreover we notice that Table 6 Amino acid pairs being more likely to be targeted by mutation in the spike protein from human SARS-CoV Difference between actual and predicted frequencies the positions of \"FN\"s overlap with \"NF\"s at positions from 526 to 530, at which the highly possible mutations would be more likely to occur. This hypothesis can be supported by the mutations found in other proteins, such as human collagen \u24235(IV) chain precursor [29] , p53 protein [34] and so on. In such a manner, we could predict the potential mutations in the spike protein from human SARS-CoV with possible amino acid pairs and positions."}
