{"title": "Pilgrims and MERS-CoV: what\u2019s the risk?", "body": "A decade after SARS, another coronavirus associated with high mortality rates is the subject of global concern [1]. As of 21st of December 2014, there have been 938 cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the vast majority of which (822) have been identified within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) [2]. Of the Saudi cases, 355 (43%) have died [2], prompting the World Health Assembly to express its concern about the situation [3]. The risk of international disease spread is especially worrying given KSA\u2019s role as the home of the most important pilgrimage sites in Islam, which leads to the large mass gathering of the annual Hajj, in which two million pilgrims converge on the KSA, and the \u2018minor\u2019 Umrah, which sees six million pilgrims arrive throughout the rest of the year. During the 2013 Hajj, Saudi authorities did not report any MERS-CoV cases, although later, findings have been reported in several countries such as the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates [4]. However, given the recent upsurge in cases in the KSA that began in April 2014 [5], and detected cases among returning pilgrims from the Umrah [6], the risk from returning pilgrims should not be ignored. In particular, countries with sizeable Muslim populations need to prepare, not just during the next Hajj, but for cases among pilgrims returning from the year-round Umrah. Understanding what the risk to pilgrims is, what the risks of pilgrims returning with MERS-CoV is, and whether human to human transmission on their return poses a public health threat, is vital. Surveillance and control measures in response to this threat may need to be adapted or developed.\n\nThe risk of infection to pilgrims coming from different regions can be estimated based on overall incidence of disease in humans in the KSA of MERS-CoV since the first infection in June 2012. Each year, the number of pilgrims entering KSA for the Hajj and Umrah is determined by a quota set by the Saudi Authorities, based upon the total country size and the proportion of the country that is Muslim [7]. This quota was used to develop a spatial distribution of risk by region of the world (Table 1). As MERS-CoV infection is a rare event, the risks of at least one infection in the travellers from each region were determined from the Poisson distribution parameterised by the expected number of cases during the Hajj period and throughout the year for Umrah [8]. The number of cases in which countries in each region should prepare for can be represented by the 95 percent upper bound of the distribution. The expected number of cases is calculated by multiplying the number of pilgrims entering KSA [9], the average duration of time pilgrims stay in KSA (which is around 21 days for Hajj and 7 days for Umrah) [10], and the incidence of MERS-CoV per day, estimated based on reports from KSA [2].\n\nBased on the incidence in the KSA since June 2012, we estimate that the most likely scenario is of one pilgrim becoming infected, with an estimated maximum of seven cases, during each period of the Hajj. If there are infections, pilgrims from the Middle East, including pilgrims originating in the KSA, would constitute around 35 percent of cases, markedly lower than their share of infections thus far (89 percent) [5]. The risk of at least one case in the Middle East was estimated to be 54 percent. Other areas at potential risk are Africa and most of Asia, given their large Muslim populations. The proportion of cases from (Central and North, South, and Southeast) Asia and Africa were estimated at 41 and 18 percent respectively. By contrast, the Americas, Europe and East Asia are likely to witness few if any cases in returning pilgrims. Best estimates are that three cases are likely to occur during the Umrah, with a maximum of ten cases (Table 1).\n\nThere was no need to obtain ethics committee approval."}
