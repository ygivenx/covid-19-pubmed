{"title": "Molecular Characterization and Phylogenetic Analysis of New Variants of the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus in Gansu, China in 2012", "body": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of Coronaviridae, is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA genome with a 5' cap and a 3' polyadenylated tail. The size of its genome is approximately 28 Kb [1]. The genome comprises a 5' untranslated region (UTR); a 3' UTR; at least seven open reading frames (ORFs) that encode four structural proteins, namely, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N); and three non-structural proteins, namely, replicases 1a and 1ab as well as ORF3 [2]. The PEDV S protein is a type I glycoprotein composed of 1,383 amino acids (aa). Similar to other coronavirus S proteins, the PEDV S protein is a glycoprotein peplomer (surface antigen) on the viral surface and contains four neutralizing epitopes (499\u2013638, 748\u2013755, 764\u2013771, and 1,368\u20131,374 aa) [3,4,5]. The PEDV S protein has a pivotal function in regulating interactions with specific host cell receptor glycoproteins to mediate viral entry [6]. Thus, the S glycoprotein is a primary target for the development of vaccines against PEDV. The S glycoprotein is also the major envelope glycoprotein of the virion, which serves as an important viral component to understand the genetic relationships of different PEDV strains and the epidemiological status of PEDV in the field [2,7,8,9].\n\nPorcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), caused by PEDV, is an acute, highly contagious, and devastating swine disease that is characterized by acute enteritis and lethal watery diarrhea, followed by dehydration frequently leading to high mortality in piglets [10,11]. PED was first observed among English fattening pigs in 1971 [10] but has increasingly become a problem in several Asian countries, including Korea [12], China [8,9,13], Japan [14], and Thailand [15]. In China, PEDV was first isolated in 1973 [9]. Almost two decades later, its prevalence has become a problem of the swine industry in China, but until 2010, the prevalence of PEDV infection was relatively low with only sporadic outbreaks. However, in late 2010, a remarkable increase in PED outbreaks occurred in the pig-producing provinces [9,16]. PED that occurred in several porcine farms and caused severe economic loss between January 2012 and March 2012 in Gansu Province, China was investigated in this study. The affected pigs exhibited watery diarrhea, dehydration, and thin-walled intestines. The disease progressed to death within four days. Pigs of all ages were affected and exhibited diarrhea and loss of appetite with different degrees of severity, which were determined to be age dependent. Among the suckling piglets, 100% became ill. Pigs >7 days of age experienced mild diarrhea and anorexia, which completely resolved within a few days. To identify the PEDV strain(s) responsible for the recent outbreak in Gansu, where located in west China, the east by Shanxi province, the south of Sichuan province, the west of Xinjiang province, and the north of Inner Mongolia province, we sequenced the full-length S gene of the isolates obtained from the diarrhea samples collected from pigs in two affected pig farms. One farm named Yongjing Tai Chi Breed Co., Ltd (Yongjing, China), and another named Hoggery of Science and Technology Breed Park of Jiugang Hongfeng Company (Jiayuguan, China).\n\nThe nucleotide sequences of the S region were 4,161 bp long for JY5C, JY6C, JY7C, YJ3F, and YJ7C. Their S proteins were 1,386 aa long with a predicted Mr of 151.7 KDa. The S protein of JY5C, JY6C, JY7C, and YJ3F contained 28 Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons and 22 asparagines predicted to be N-glycosylated (Figure 1A,B). The S protein of the YJ7C strain contained 29 Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons and 23 asparagines predicted to be N-glycosylated (Figure 1C). However, the S protein of the CV777 vaccine strain contained 29 Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons and 22 asparagines predicted to be N-glycosylated (Figure 1D). For JY5C, JY6C, JY7C, and YJ3F, four (from N to V at 57, from N to I at 127, from T to I at 232, and from N to S at 719) of the changes in the predicted amino acid sequence destroyed N-linked glycosylation sites, whereas another three changes (from S to N at 58, from I to T at 116, and from T to N at 1193) created three new glycosylation sites compared with the vaccine strain CV777 (Figure 2). For the YJ7C strain, three amino acid changes (from N to V at 57, from N to I at 127, and from T to I at 232) destroyed N-linked glycosylation sites and another three changes (from S to N at 58, from I to T at 116, and from T to N at 1193) created three new glycosylation sites compared with the vaccine strain CV777 (Figure 2). The changes in the N-linked glycosylation sites between the Gansu PEDV strains from our study and the vaccine strain may influence their pathogenicity and antigenicity and should be researched in the future. \n\nThe nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence homology results are described in Table 1. The nucleotide sequence of the five strains from our study (JY5C, JY6C, JY7C, YJ3F, and YJ7C) had 99.3% to 100% nucleotide sequence identity to one another, and their deduced amino acids had 99.0% to 100% identity to one another. The S genes\u2019 nucleotide and deduced amino acid identities of five strains from our study (JY5C, JY6C, JY7C, YJ3F, and YJ7C) with the other PEDV reference strains are described in Table 2. The PEDV strain that had the highest DNA sequence identity to our PEDV strains was CH8 (one Chinese PEDV strain), which had 98.4% identity and the deduced amino acids had more than 98.0% identity. However, the nucleotide sequence of our PEDV strains had only 93.8% to 93.9% identity to the CV777 vaccine strain, and their deduced amino acids had 93.6% to 93.7% identity to the CV777 vaccine strain. The nucleotide sequence of our PEDV strains had lower identity (93.3% to 95.7%) to the previous domestic strains (DX, LZC, LJB-03, JS-2004-2, and CHS) and their deduced amino acids had 92.6% to 95.7% identity to the previous domestic strains (DX, LZC, LJB-03, JS-2004-2, and CHS). The nucleotide sequence of our PEDV strains also had low identity (93.2% to 94.6% and 93.7% to 93.8%) to the Japanese strains (MK, NK, and KH) and the European strain (Br1-87), respectively, and their deduced amino acids had 93.1% to 94.2% and 93.4% to 93.6% identities to the Japanese strains (MK, NK, and KH) and the Europe strain (Br1-87), respectively. The nucleotide sequence of our PEDV strains had higher identity (94.7% to 97.1%) to seven South Korean strains (KNU-0801, KNU-0802, KNU-0901, KNU-0902, KNU-0903, KNU-0904, and KNU-0905), and their deduced amino acids had 94.1% to 96.8% identity. \n\nPhylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the S gene revealed three major clusters, and the third group has two subgroups (3-1 and 3-2). All PEDVs isolated from China in our study belonged to subgroup 3-1 (Figure 3). Group 1 comprised one strain from South Korea (KNU-0904). Group 2 comprised three strains from South Korea (KNU-0801, KNU-0901, and Chinju 99) and two strains from Japan (NK and KH). Subgroup 3-1 comprised five strains from our study (JY5C, JY6C, JY7C, YJ3F, and YJ7C), three strains (CH1, CH8, CHGD-01) that were identified from China in 2011 and four strains from South Korea KNU-0802, KNU-0902, KNU-0903, and KNU-0905). Group 3-2 comprised 15 strains from China (vaccine strain CV777, CH2, CH3, CH4, CH5, CH6, CH7, CHS, LZC, DX, LJB-03, JS-2004-2, CH/FJND-1-2011, CH/FJND-2-2011, and CH/FJND-3-2011), two strains from South Korea (parent DR13 and attenuated DR13), one strain from Great Britain (Br1-87), and one strain from Japan (MK). The five variant strains from our study (JY5C, JY6C, JY7C, YJ3F, and YJ7C), two strains (CH8 and CH/FJND-3-2011) that were identified from China, and five PEDV isolates from South Korea (KNU-0802, KNU-0902, KNU-0903, and KNU-0905) shared a 4-aa insertion (at positions 56\u201359 of the S protein), 1-aa insertion (at position 140 of the S protein), and 2-aa deletions (at positions 163\u2013164 of the S protein), compared with CV777 (Figure 4). Our results indicate that the North Chinese PEDV strains from our study had a close relationship with the South Korean strains and mapped phylogenetically to the same branch. However, they differed genetically from the European strains (including the vaccine strain CV777) and the early domestic strains. Similar to the result by Li et al. [9], the appearance of strains from China similar to those from South Korea and their function in the recent PED outbreak in South China, should be further investigated.\n\nThe PEDV S protein is a type I glycoprotein. Its neutralizing epitopes contain COE (499\u2013638 aa), SS2 (748\u2013755 aa), SS6 (764\u2013771 aa), and 2C10 (1,368\u20131,374 aa) [3,4,5], and regions of the alignment sequences (Figure 5) correspond to these regions are COE (504\u2013643 aa), SS2 (753\u2013760 aa), SS6 (769\u2013776 aa), and 2C10 (1,373\u20131,379 aa). In our study, compared with the vaccine strain CV777, eight mutations (A\u2192S at 517, S\u2192G at 523, V\u2192I at 527, T\u2192S at 549, G\u2192S at 594, A\u2192E at 605, L\u2192F at 612, and I\u2192V at 635) were found in all the five PEDV strains from our study (JY5C, JY6C, JY7C, YJ3F, and YJ7C) and one mutation (L\u2192H at 521) was found in JY5C, JY6C, and JY7C in the neutralizing epitope COE. Compared with the vaccine strain CV777, one mutation (Y\u2192S at 766) was also found in all the five PEDV strains from our study (JY5C, JY6C, JY7C, YJ3F, and YJ7C) in the neutralizing epitope SS6. However, compared with the vaccine strain CV777, no mutations were found in the five PEDV strains from our study (JY5C, JY6C, JY7C, YJ3F, and YJ7C) in the neutralizing epitopes SS2 and 2C10 (Figure 5). Similar to other coronavirus S proteins, the PEDV S protein is a glycoprotein peplomer (surface antigen) on the viral surface, with a pivotal function in stimulating induction of neutralizing antibodies in the natural host. Thus, the S glycoprotein is a primary target for the development of effective vaccines against PEDV. Further research is needed to determine whether the amino acid changes in the Gansu strains from our study result in any antigenicity changes.\n\nRT-PCR amplification and sequencing analysis of the full-length PEDV S genes were used to investigate the isolates from diarrhea samples from local pig farms with severe diarrhea in piglets. The variant strains were detected in this study, implying an identical distribution profile for PEDV on pig farms in Gansu, China. The sequence insertions and deletions in the S gene and mutations in the antigenic regions found in variant strains possibly provided stronger pathogenicity and antigenicity to the new PEDV variants that influenced the effectiveness of the CV777-based vaccine, ultimately causing the 2012 outbreak of severe diarrhea in the porcine farms of Gansu Province, China. Future studies should investigate the biological functions of these particular insertions, deletions, and mutations.\n\nA total of 17 samples (fecal and intestinal) were collected from seven dead piglets showing signs of watery diarrhea and dehydration from two farms in Gansu Province, China (Table 3). These samples were collected individually and placed in separate sterile specimen containers. Samples were homogenized with PBS. The suspensions were vortexed and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 \u00d7 g. The supernatants were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C before use. \n\nAll samples were evaluated by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) using PEDV special primers (Table 4). In brief, viral RNA was extracted from the supernatants of the homogenized samples with TRIzol LS (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RT was carried out using random hexamer primers (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan), and the cDNA was immediately amplified with primers, which were designed based on the sequences of PEDV reference strains (Table 4) under the following conditions: denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 52 \u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 90 s. The RT-PCR products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ultraviolet illumination after ethidium bromide staining. \n\nFive of 17 pig samples were positive for PEDV by RT-PCR. Sequencing analysis of the full-length S gene was performed for the five samples designated as JY5C, JY6C, JY7C, YJ3F, and YJ7C. In brief, bands of the corresponding size of the gene were excised, and the synthesized DNA was purified using a QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and sequenced by BGI Company (Peking, China). The five PEDV S gene sequences were aligned with the sequences of 32 previously published PEDV S genes (Table 5) using the DNASTAR, DNAMAN, and MegAlign version 5.0 (DNAStar Inc., Madison, WI, USA) software packages [17]. To investigate their molecular and epidemiological characteristics and to determine their profile of genetic diversity, phylogenetic trees were constructed using molecular evolutionary genetics analysis MegAlign version 5.0 [17] with the neighbor-joining (NJ) method to calculate distance. Bootstrap values were estimated for 1,000 replicates. SignalP 4.1 software [18] was used to predicte the N-glycosylated sites.\n\nThere were few positives (5) by RT-PCR when 17 piglets with water diarrhea and dehydration were sampled. There may be two reasons for this phenomenon. Firstly, inability to amplify virus from all piglets might impact our results. Secondly, the piglets maybe have coinfections that might skew our results. \n\nOur study of the full-length S gene revealed a more comprehensive distribution profile that reflects the current PEDV status in pig farms in Gansu Province, China, including the presence of strains similar to those from South Korea. These data indicate that the new variant PEDV strains in Gansu Province, which were first found in 2011, may have originated from South China. Thus, certain actions must be taken to prevent the continued transmission of this virus, including the development of novel vaccines for prevention."}
