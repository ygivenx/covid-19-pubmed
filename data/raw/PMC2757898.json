{"title": "The Role of Genomics in the Identification, Prediction, and Prevention of Biological Threats", "body": "Since the anthrax letter attacks of 2001, when letters containing anthrax spores were mailed to several news media offices and two Democratic senators in the United States, killing five people and infecting 17 others, funding agencies in the US and other countries have prioritized research projects on organisms that might potentially challenge our security and economy should they be used as biological weapons. This has resulted in large amounts of funding dedicated to so-called \u201cbiodefense\u201d research, totaling close to \u259150 billion between 2001 and 2009 [4]. Genomics has benefited greatly from this influx of research dollars and as a result, representatives of most major animal, plant, and human pathogens have been sequenced (http://www.pathogenportal.org/). Supported by federal funds from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and the US Department of Defense, research programs, such as the Microbial Sequencing Centers and the Bioinformatics Resource Centers (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/pathogenGenomics/PDF/genomicsinitiatives.htm), have been established that carry out genomics research on pathogenic organisms and have spearheaded a new phase of the genomics revolution. Similar programs were started in Europe, such as those at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in the United Kingdom, and the multinational European effort, The Network of Excellence EuroPathoGenomics (http://www.noe-epg.uni-wuerzburg.de/epg_general.htm). As an example of the success of these types of programs, the genome sequences of over 90,000 influenza viruses were rapidly generated and are now deposited in GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/aboutdatabase.html). Because of the availability of large sequencing capacity and the large amount of information, the response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic was rapid and efficient (Box 2): Genomics information was generated within days and validated diagnostic tools were approved within weeks [5],[6]. A global response was made possible through tremendous research efforts enabled by genomic research.\n\nOpen access to genomics resources (i.e., raw sequence data and associated publications) is an essential component of the nation preparedness to biological threats (biopreparedness), whether intentionally delivered or not. Although some consider open-source genomic resources a threat to security [7] because they make publicly available information that could facilitate the construction of dangerous infectious agents, we strongly disagree with this point of view. Rather, we and others [8] believe that it is an enabling tool more useful to those in charge of our public health and biosecurity than to those with ill intentions. Genomic sequence data can provide a starting point for the development of new vaccines, drugs, and diagnostic tests [9], hence improving public health capabilities and increasing our biopreparedness. Access to the organisms from which the sequences are derived should be restricted, not their genome sequences. Now that genomics technologies are broadly available, there is the potential for commercial interests to hamper the release of genomic data in the public domain. Thus it is important that federally funded large-scale genome sequencing efforts have enforceable rapid release policies. This accessibility could afford further opportunities to capitalize on investments in genome sequencing by providing the necessary resources to biopreparedness.\n\nWhereas genome projects aimed at sequencing one, two, or three isolates of a pathogen seemed adequate a few years ago, it is now possible to sequence rapidly hundreds of individual genomes for each species. Access to relevant, well-curated culture collections [10] and DNA preparations suitable for sequencing may become a bottleneck in the future when sequencing resources are no longer limiting. More importantly, the impact of large genomic sequence datasets from clinical isolates will be limited without key clinical metadata that characterize these isolates, such as patients' medical information, date of isolation, and the number of culture passages in the laboratory. Open access to large numbers of sequences and associated metadata allows for powerful comparative genomic analyses and thus provides major insights into the characteristics of a pathogen. Standardized vocabulary should be developed to describe these isolates and the genes they contain. Such efforts have already started, for example through the open-access journal Standards in Genome Sciences (SIGS) (http://standardsingenomics.org/index.php/sigen), but the dedicated resources are not adequate and highlight the lack of understanding of the importance of metadata in genomics. Initiatives such as those of the Genomics Standards Consortium have made great strides [11],[12], but still need widespread implementation from the ever-expanding genomic community. Open access to the genomic DNA that has been sequenced or the culture from which the DNA was extracted and to the associated metadata is key to successful genome sequencing projects, whether on single or several hundred genomes or metagenomes. Well-documented genome sequence data will form a key growing resource for biodefense and other research fields.\n\nAs we enter a new era of modern genomics, the ever-expanding sequence datasets are becoming more challenging to analyze. Future analysts will require powerful new bioinformatics tools in conjunction with new computer systems engineered with genomic analysis in mind. Open-source new bioinformatics software tools are being developed that exploit Web-based services and the increasing computing power provided by academic and commercial \u201ccloud computing networks\u201d (large computing resources provided as a service over the Internet). For example, \u201cScience Clouds\u201d (http://workspace.globus.org/clouds/) allow members of the scientific community to lease cloud computing resources free of charge. To leverage these capabilities, novel cloud-optimized bioinformatics tools are being developed, such as the genome sequence read mapper CloudBurst [13]. In addition, novel resources are currently under development to increase the availability of open-source bioinformatics tools for cloud computing (http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0949201; http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0844494). These emerging tools make access to the Worldwide Web the only requirement to join the genomic revolution and achieve large scale bioinformatics analyses that could not be possible on local servers. As a consequence, it is conceivable that in the future genomic research will increasingly move away from the large sequencing centers toward a more decentralized organization. Decentralized rapid genome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis of infectious agents will enable near-real-time global surveillance, detection of new pathogens, new virulence factors, antimicrobial resistance determinants, or engineered organisms.\n\nBecause the resources for affordable high-throughput sequencing, data processing, and analysis are available, the time is right to think about microbial population genomics and large-scale microbial metagenomics in the context of biodefense research (Box 3). Traditionally, the concept of population genomics has applied to variation within a species. However, a bacterial culture, even if derived from a single clone, is composed of millions of cells that are not necessarily identical at the genome sequence level, hence forming a population of genomes. Therefore we propose to apply the concept of population genomics to microbial cultures. The assemblage of genotypes defines what is called a \u201cculture,\u201d \u201cculture stock,\u201d or \u201creference strain.\u201d Population genomics addresses the genomic diversity within these assemblages and has significant implications for many fields of research but, most importantly, for pathogen evolution, diagnostics, epidemiology, and microbial forensics. For example, following the anthrax mail attacks of 2001, microbiologists and genomicists joined forces to characterize the unique genetic traits of the Bacillus anthracis spores recovered from the envelopes, which were quickly identified as the B. anthracis Ames strain (DAAR et al., unpublished data). Sequencing the genome of several single colonies obtained from the spores revealed that the entire chromosome and its associated plasmids were 100% identical to the genome sequence of the ancestral B. anthracis Ames strain that was stored for over 20 years in a military laboratory in Frederick, Maryland. The only genotypic differences were found in a small, phenotypically and genetically distinct portion of cells grown from the spores used in the attacks. Genomic characterization of these phenotypic variants revealed a number of unique genetic alterations that together provided a characteristic DNA fingerprint of the spore population that could be unequivocally matched to the spore sample used in the attacks. Using this fingerprint, a genetic assay was developed to screen a B. anthracis spore repository, which identified the origin of the spores as a single spore stock of B. anthracis Ames. This stock was stored at the US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases in Fort Detrick, Maryland, narrowing the pool of suspects to a manageable number (those who had access to the spore stock) for the investigative team. The police investigation that followed identified a potential suspect as the custodian of the spore stock. This was the first use of microbial genomics as an essential tool in a forensic investigation. In the course of the investigation, scientists had to establish culture repositories from strains used in research in the US and build databases of genome sequences of all B. anthracis isolates. This work took several years and delayed the investigation significantly. A lesson to be learned from this investigation should therefore be that there is a need for comprehensive databases of unique DNA fingerprints of stocks of potentially threatening pathogens. In the event that another bioterror attack were to take place such genomic databases would be key in quickly establishing the source of the biological material.\n\nThe concept of population genomics also applies to epidemiological studies of outbreaks of infectious diseases such as those caused by food-borne or zoonotic pathogens, such as Salmonella spp. Traditionally, epidemiologists and pathologists have used low-resolution methods such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), or multi-locus variable number tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) to trace an individual isolate from a patient back to a potentially infected food source or to isolates from other patients [14]\u2013[17]. In 2006, for example, during an outbreak of pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections in 26 states of the US, which was caused by contaminated spinach, isolates of the pathogen were recovered from cows and wild pigs (the zoonotic reservoirs), bags of spinach (the vehicle of transmission), and ill patients (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm55d926a1.htm). One of these isolates was designated as the reference for the outbreak based on conserved PFGE patterns. Genome sequencing of several isolates from the same outbreak performed in our laboratory, however, revealed genomic variations that questioned a direct evolutionary link between all outbreak-associated isolates (Eppinger et al., unpublished data). Comparative genomics followed by whole-genome phylogenetic analyses based on single nucleotide polymorphisms demonstrated that these isolates were indeed closely related to one another and only distantly related to other E. coli O157:H7 isolates, hence linking all isolates to the same outbreak, something that was not possible using PFGE patterns. In this case, phylogenetic analyses suggest that several highly related genotypes were at the source of the outbreak, thus challenging the utility of assigning a single reference strain to a specific outbreak. Instead, collecting and sequencing tens or hundreds of isolates from each source or patient linked to an outbreak would provide a better basis for understanding the genomic diversity within the outbreak population and would aid in defining the population dynamics of an outbreak.\n\nInsufficient attention has been paid to the human microbiome (i.e., the consortium of microbes that inhabit the human body) as it relates to our efforts to increase biopreparedness. New analyses of the diversity and composition of the human microbiome are making it increasingly clear that human health depends on a delicate equilibrium between the microbial inhabitants and the human host [18],[19]. Severe effects on health could be caused not only by the introduction of true pathogens in the traditional sense into these human-associated microbial communities (e.g., Vibrio cholerae, the etiologic agent of cholera) but potentially also by slight shifts in the proportions of different populations within the community that give an otherwise harmless species or strain an undesirable advantage over others, a similar situation to what is observed in bacterial vaginosis [20]. Probiotic dietary supplements of live microorganisms deliver beneficial bacteria that promote an healthy state of the targeted microbiota. In a completely hypothetical possibility, the opposite would also be plausible, where the healthy microbiota (skin, gut, or upper respiratory tract, among others) may be disturbed by introducing large amounts of \u201ccontrabiotics,\u201d i.e., living nonpathogenic bacteria that would shift the microbiota away from a healthy state. A better understanding of the ecological principles that shape the composition of our microbiome might contribute to our biopreparedness for such a threat to public health.\n\nThe field of biodefense has thoroughly embraced genomics and made it a keystone for developing better identification technologies, diagnostic tools, and vaccines and improving our understanding of pathogen virulence and evolution. Enabling technologies and bioinformatics tools have shifted genomics from a separate research discipline to a tool so powerful that it can provide novel insights that were not imaginable a few years ago, including for example redefining the notion of strains or cultures in the context of biopreparedness or microbial forensics. Challenges remain, though, mostly in the form of large amounts of data that are being generated, and will continue to be generated in the future, and are becoming difficult to manage. The need for better bioinformatic algorithms, access to faster computing capabilities, larger or novel and more efficient data storage devices, and better training in genomics are all in critical demand, and will be required to fully embrace the genomic revolution. Our nation's preparedness for biological threats, whether they are deliberate or not, and our public health system would benefit greatly by leveraging these capabilities into better real-time diagnostics (in the environment as well as at the bedside), vaccines, a greater understanding of the evolutionary process that makes a friendly microbe become a pathogen (Box 3) (hence to better predict what microbial foes will be facing us in the near future), and better forensics and epidemiological tools. The time is right to be bold and capitalize on these enabling technological advances to sequence microbial species or complex microbial communities to the greatest level possible\u2014that is, hundreds of genomes per species or samples\u2014but let us not forget that informatics and computing resources are now becoming the bottleneck to actually making major progress in this field."}
