{"title": "MERS coronavirus envelope protein has a single transmembrane domain that forms pentameric ion channels", "body": "In September 2012 the first case of a novel coronavirus (CoV) infection was reported (Zaki et al., 2012) and the etiological agent was named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (de Groot et al., 2013) . As of 23 May 2014, 635 cases and 193 deaths have been confirmed (http://www.who.int/ csr/don/2014 05 23 mers/en/). An investigation on 47 cases between September 2012 and June 2013 revealed that MERS patients display similar clinical features to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus infection, but progress more rapidly Abbreviations: AQPZ, E. coli aquaporin Z; DDM, n-dodecyl \u2424-d-maltoside; DHPC, 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DMPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DPhPC, 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DOPS, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine; DPC, dodecyl phosphocholine; E, envelope; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERGIC, ER Golgi intermediate compartment; FTIR, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy; IBV, infectious bronchitis virus; LMPG, 1-myristoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol; M, membrane; MHV, murine hepatitis virus; MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; N, nucleocapsid; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; S, spike; SDS, sodium dodecyl sulphate; TM, transmembrane; TGEV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus. towards respiratory failure (Assiri et al., 2013) . In addition, a majority of MERS patients (estimated at 75%) has at least one co-morbid condition, in contrast to only 10-30% in SARS patients (Assiri et al., 2013; Drosten, 2013; Raj et al., 2014) . Mortality rate in MERS-CoVinfected individuals is about 40%, compared to 10% during the SARS outbreak (http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003 05 07a/en/). Human-to-human transmission has been reported, although it is still limited and inefficient . Although there are still no effective treatments, a mouse model suitable for studying MERS-CoV infection has been engineered (Zhao et al., 2014) . The genomic sequence of MERS-CoV is closely related to bat CoVs HKU4 and HKU5, which belong to clade c of \u2424-coronaviruses (Annan et al., 2013; Drexler et al., 2014) . Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV is thought to have crossed over from bats to humans, although MERS-CoV used camels as an intermediate species .\n\nThe structural proteins in coronaviruses are N (nucleocapsid) and integral membrane proteins S (spike), M (membrane) and E (envelope). The S protein is involved in host recognition and entry into the cell. Recently, the crystal structure of the fusion core (Gao et al., 2013) and the receptor binding domain (Chen et al., 2013) of MERS S protein have been solved. The M protein is the most abundant protein in the lipid envelope of virions and defines their shape (Barcena et al., 2009; Neuman et al., 2011) , although high resolution structural data is still not available. The E protein is scarcely present in the virion, but abundantly expressed in the infected cell, mainly distributed in intracellular membranes between ER and http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2015.02.023 0168-1702/\u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the case of SARS-CoV, the E protein accumulates at the ERGIC (Nieto- .\n\nCoV E proteins are 76-109 amino acids long and predicted to have at least one \u2423-helical transmembrane (TM) domain based on prediction algorithms (Surya et al., 2013) . The extramembrane C-terminal domain has some hydrophobic character, and could represent in some cases a second TM domain, e.g., in infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) E proteins, although this has not been confirmed experimentally. SARS-CoV E protein has been shown unequivocally to have just one TM domain , and is the only E protein for which structural data is available Pervushin et al., 2009 ). E proteins have been shown to form ion channels in synthetic membranes (Torres et al., 2007; Wilson et al., 2006) , with reported conductance of 20-30 pS. However, characterization with properly purified full length and transmembrane peptides of SARS-CoV E protein has produced much higher (>10 times) conductances Verdia-Baguena et al., 2012 , 2013a . In SARS-CoV, this channel activity has been linked to activation of caspase-1 and maturation of pro-inflammatory IL-1\u2424 during infection (Nieto- , although a detailed mechanism to explain this functional link is still not available.\n\nRemoval of E protein is in general deleterious to coronaviruses, although the severity of the damage is strongly virus-dependent. For example, deletion of E gene in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) results in blockage of virus trafficking in the cellular secretory pathway and prevention of virus maturation (Ortego et al., 2002) . Mutations at the C-terminal region of MHV E protein results in impaired virion assembly and maturation (Fischer et al., 1998) . SARS-CoV lacking the E gene is attenuated (DeDiego et al., 2007) , and MERS-CoV lacking the E gene cannot propagate, despite showing similar viral RNA level to wild-type virus (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2013) . Based on the attenuating effect of E protein removal, a SARS-CoV lacking E gene is currently being studied as potential vaccine Fett et al., 2013; Netland et al., 2010) , and a similar E-deletion approach has been suggested for controlling the MERS outbreak to obtain a virus that is replication-competent, but propagation-defective (Almaz\u00e1n et al., 2013) .\n\nThe only coronavirus E protein structurally characterized in some detail is the one in SARS-CoV, as a transmembrane domain (Pervushin et al., 2009; Torres et al., 2006) and latter as a truncated form (residues 8-65), obtained using a 20 residue N-terminal tag that included a poly-His tail . Herein, we report for the first time the expression, purification, and preliminary structural study on full-length 82 residue MERS-CoV E protein without any tag. This purified protein allowed its biophysical characterization to conclude that it has striking similarities to SARS-CoV E protein.\n\nThe DNA sequence encoding E protein from MERS-CoV-EMC12 (GenBank accession number JX869059) was fused N-terminally to a 6-His-MBP tag, followed by a TEV protease cleavage site, to form the construct 6-His-MBP-TEV-E. This was subcloned into pTB-MalE for expression. To investigate the effect of the four native cysteines (Fig. 1A ), in addition to wild type MERS-CoV E, three additional Cys-to-Ala mutants were generated, at positions 23 and 30 (E AACC ), 40 and 43 (E CCAA ), and 23, 30, 40 and 43 (E AAAA ). Expression and purification of non labeled and 15 N-labeled E AAAA was performed following the protocol described previously for MBP-tagged full-length SARS-COV E protein , except that the elution buffer contained 1.6 mM n-dodecyl \u2424-d-maltoside (DDM, Calbiochem).\n\nFor SDS-NuPAGE, samples were run in 4-12% NuPAGE \u00ae Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) with NuPAGE \u00ae MES SDS running buffer and stained with SimplyBlue TM SafeStain (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Blue-native PAGE (BN-PAGE) was performed as described previously (Gan et al., 2011) . Lyophilized peptide was solubilized to 0.1 mM in a sample buffer containing 50 mM DHPC (Avanti Polar Lipids), 5, 25 and 50 mM DPC (Avanti Polar Lipids), or 21 mM LMPG (Anatrace). Escherichia coli aquaporin Z (AqpZ) in 20 mM SDS was included as additional molecular weight marker.\n\nSample preparation, ATR data collection and H/D exchange were performed as described previously ) on a Nicolet Nexus spectrometer (Madison, USA). Briefly, the peptide was incorporated in multilamellar liposomes by dissolving a dry mixture of peptide and POPC (Avanti Polar Lipids) or DMPC (Avanti Polar Lipids) at a 1:50 molar ratio. Fourier self-deconvolution was performed on the amide I region using FWHH of 20 cm \u22121 and a narrowing factor k of 1.5 (Kauppinen et al., 1981) .\n\nSedimentation equilibrium data were collected at 20 \u2022 C in a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm. Lyophilized peptide was dissolved to OD 280 of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 (12 mm pathlength) in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.3), 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM C14-betaine and 32.3% D 2 O. The samples were centrifuged in six-channel charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces with quartz windows. Radial distribution profiles were acquired at 18,500, 22,700, and 27,800 rpm after reaching equilibrium. The latter was tested by HeteroAnalysis. Data were processed and fitted to several monomer-N-mer models in SEDFIT and SEDPHAT (Schuck, 2003) . \n\nThe experiments reported here have been carried out in single ion channels reconstituted on planar membranes. Planar bilayer membranes were formed from two monolayers prepared from a lipid mixture containing 1,2-dioleoylsn-glycero-3-phpsphocoline (DOPC), 1,2-di-(9Z-octadecenoyl)-snglycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DOPS) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) at a 3:1:1 (DOPC:DOPS:DOPE) in pentane on 70-90 m diameter orifices in the 15 m-thick Teflon partition that separated two identical chambers (Bezrukov and Vodyanoy, 1993; Montal and Mueller, 1972) . The orifices were pretreated with a 1% solution of hexadecane in pentane. Aqueous solutions of KCl and NaCl were buffered with 5 mM HEPES at pH 6. All measurements were performed at room temperature. Single channel insertion was achieved by adding 2-3 L of a 150 g/mL solution of protein in the buffer that contains acetonitrile:isopropanol (40:60) at the cis side of the chamber.\n\nAn electric potential was applied using Ag/AgCl electrodes in 2 M KCl, 1.5% agarose bridges assembled within standard 250 ml pipette tips. The potential was defined as positive when it was higher on the side of the protein addition (the cis side of the membrane chamber), whereas the trans side was set to ground. An Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) in the voltage-clamp mode was used to measure the current and applied potential. The chamber and the head stage were isolated from external noise sources with a double metal screen (Amuneal Manufacturing Corp., Philadelphia, PA). The single-channel conductance was obtained from the current measurement at applied potential of +100 mV in symmetrical salt solutions.\n\nNMR experiments were performed at 318 K using an Avance-II 600 NMR spectrometer with a cryogenic probe. Sodium 2,2dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (DSS) was used as the internal reference for 1 H nuclei. The chemical shifts of 15 N nuclei were calculated from the 1 H chemical shifts. The NMR data were processed using TopSpin 3.1 (www.bruker-biospin.com) and analyzed using CARA (www.nmr.ch). To identify membrane-embedded residues, the NMR sample was lyophilized overnight and reconstituted in 99% D 2 O. Immediately after reconstitution, a 2D [ 1 H-15 N]-HSQC spectrum was collected.\n\nFull length MERS-CoV E protein was successfully expressed as a fusion protein with maltose binding protein (MBP) attached to the N-terminus of E. MBP was subsequently removed by TEV protease, leaving behind additional 3 residues, SNA, at the N terminus of MERS-CoV E protein (Fig. 1A ). Four mutants were tested (see Section 2), but only a Cys-null mutant (E AAAA ) could be obtained with sufficient purity, which was further characterized. This mutant is referred to hereafter as 'MERS-CoV E protein'. The purity of this mutant was at least 90% after reverse-phase HPLC purification, as shown by gel SDS electrophoresis (Fig. 1B) . When reconstituted in POPC lipid bilayers, the polypeptide was predominantly \u2423-helical, as indicated by an infrared amide I band centered at 1655 cm \u22121 (Fig. 1C) . These spectral features are also common to SARS-CoV E protein , which suggests a similar overall secondary structure.\n\nScreening of MERS-CoV E protein in micellar and bicellar environments identified SDS as the best detergent to achieve good peak dispersion in the two dimensions of an [ 1 H-15 N]-HSQC spectrum ( Fig. 2A) , implying foldedness and lack of aggregation. We note that although this SDS environment will not allow the formation of oligomers (Fig. 1B) , it is nevertheless likely to produce near-native secondary structure. This assumption is based on results obtained previously for SARS-CoV E protein , where titration of the polypeptide SDS with increasing DPC, up to a 1:4 SDS/DPC molar ratio, did not lead to changes in secondary structure, as monitored by 13 C \u2423 chemical shifts.\n\nTo determine if MERS-CoV E protein has one or two TM domains, the membrane-embedded residues were quantified using [ 1 H-15 N]-HSQC spectra in an H N -D 2 O exchange experiment. In 99% D 2 O, \u223c20 residues were found to be protected from exchange (Fig. 2B) , which suggests a single \u2423-helical TM domain.\n\nEarly studies of N-or C-terminally tagged MHV E (Maeda et al., 2001) and SARS-CoV E (Yuan et al., 2006) proposed that both N and C-terminal ends were facing the cytoplasm, with the implication of two TM domains. However, purified full length SARS-CoV E protein has only one TM domain, as shown in a H N -D 2 O exchange experiment . In addition, the topology of untagged SARS-CoV E protein, both in SARS-infected cells and transfected cells shows that only one TM domain is possible, with C-terminal and N-terminal ends located cytoplasmically and lumenally, respectively (Nieto- . The high sequence similarity between MERS-CoV and MHV E proteins (Fig. 2C) further suggests that the latter also has one \u2423-helical TM domain.\n\nWe have shown previously that SARS-CoV E protein forms homo-pentamers Parthasarathy et al., 2012) . To test if MERS-CoV E protein also forms pentamers, Blue-native PAGE electrophoresis and sedimentation experiments were performed. When MERS-CoV E protein was solubilized in 5 mM DPC micelles (1:50 protein-to-detergent molar ratio) it migrated as a single band in a BN-PAGE gel (Fig. 3A ). In common with other membrane proteins (Gan et al., 2011) , the molecular weight of this band may not correspond to the molecular weight markers used, or to the AQPZ ladder (\u223c25 kDa for the monomer) possibly because of residual detergent bound to the protein. However, after dilution with 25 mM DPC, MERS-CoV E protein dissociated into lower molecular weight oligomers, from monomers to pentamers (Fig. 3A ). This ladder conveniently provides an internal reference that serves as a oligomeric size marker. Therefore, by comparison with that ladder, we confidently assign the single band observed in 5 mM DPC to pentameric oligomers. The same oligomeric size was observed when using 50 mM DHPC and 20 mM LMPG (Fig. 3A , right panel), which are potentially good environments for structural characterization.\n\nThe oligomeric state of E protein was further confirmed by using analytical ultracentrifugation. MERS-CoV E protein was solubilized in 5 mM C14-betaine micelles at the concentrations described in Section 2. Sedimentation equilibrium data could be best fitted to a monomer-pentamer self-association reversible model ( Fig. 3B and C) with apparent association constant, K a , of 6.3 \u00d7 10 17 M \u22124 (Log K a = 17.8). This is almost identical to the value (Log K a = 17.5) obtained in C14-betaine for the full length wild type SARS-CoV E protein in presence of reductant TCEP (Parthasarathy et al., 2012) . These values are one order of magnitude higher than those obtained for truncated Cys-less SARS-CoV E protein (residues 8-65) although the latter contained a relatively long (20 residues) N-terminal tag, which may have affected the stability of the pentamer.\n\nA total of four cysteines are present in the wild-type MERS-CoV E protein sequence, two in the predicted TM domain and two in the predicted C-terminal juxtamembrane region (Fig. 1) . The above results suggest that the introduced Cys-to-Ala mutations in the TM domain do not affect oligomer stability. Assuming that the mutual orientation between the TM helices is the same in all CoV E proteins, and therefore to that of SARS-CoV E protein (Pervushin et al., 2009; Torres et al., 2005 Torres et al., , 2006 , the orientation of the two TM cysteines in MERS-CoV E can be assumed to be near the helix-helix interface (Fig. 3D) . The TM helix-helix orientation of coronavirus E proteins has been recently validated by in vivo data, where revertant mutants of SARS-CoV were obtained in mice after introducing a channel-inactivating mutation V25F in its E protein. This mutation was located at an interhelical position in our pentameric model, whereas the mutations that recovered channel activity were at positions 37, 30, 26, 27 and 19, all located at the helix-helix interface and facing V25F (Nieto- . The two cysteines at the TM domain of MERS-CoV E are equivalent to positions 30 and 23 in the SARS-CoV E protein. Despite this putative inter-helical orientation, these Cys-to-Ala mutations did not seem to affect oligomer size or stability.\n\nConductance histograms of recorded traces at +100 mV are shown in Fig. 4A . We can observe that MERS E protein forms an ion channel with conductance of 0.3 \u00b1 0.01 nS in 1 M KCl. The channel displays ohmic behavior (Fig. 4B) . These value is comparable to those obtained for purified truncated SARS-CoV E protein in the same conditions , where conductance was 0.39 \u00b1 0.02 nS. Synthetic full length SARS-CoV E protein and synthetic transmembrane domain of SARS-CoV E (E TM , residues 7-38) produced single channel conductances of 0.19 \u00b1 0.06 pS and 0.18 \u00b1 0.12 nS in 1 M NaCl (Verdia- Baguena et al., 2012) , although these lower values may have been due to modifications introduced during synthesis or to impurities.\n\nIn conclusion, we show that MERS-CoV E protein can be efficiently purified and, like SARS-CoV E protein, forms homopentamers where each monomer has a single TM domain. The substitution Cys-to-Ala in the two native TM Cys residues seems well tolerated and does not affect the pentamer stability or channel activity significantly, even though these residues should be located at or near the helix-helix interface. The good behavior of this construct in detergent enables structural characterization that is in progress, as well as drug binding biophysical assays."}
