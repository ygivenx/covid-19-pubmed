Many scientists around the world are studying different approaches to induce cardiac regeneration in hope to unravel new treatments that can improve cardiac function post ischemic injury. Genetic medicine is one of the avenue of research to treat a failing heart post myocardial infarction (MI) 3 . In this research of avenue scientist aims to adjust gene expression in the heart using viral vectors, small molecules, or RNA based approach to promote cardiac protection, cardiovascular or cardiac regeneration in ischemic cardiac disease. modRNA is a novel gene therapy platform that can be used to alter the levels of proteins in mammalian cells and tissues 4, 5 and to treat heart diseases [6] [7] [8] . The concept of therapeutically altering mRNA expression has great potential in treatment of human diseases 9 . To date, several therapeutic approaches using siRNA and antisense oligonucleotides, have been successfully tested to reduce mRNA levels in the cells 10, 11 . Yet, the upregulation of proteins in tissues is challenging mostly to the high amount of mRNA needed to treat human tissue. Supplying a large amount of mRNA in vivo, can subsequently elicit a higher immune response. Preclinical studies with modRNA showed that due to the transient expression of modRNA (gene expression return to baseline is few days), modRNA will be needed, both in direct or intravenous delivery methods, to be redelivered to achieve higher gene expression 6, [12] [13] [14] [15] .\n\nThe expression of genes is controlled intricately at the post-transcriptional level 16 . The level of individual mRNA type inside a cell does not ensure the synthesis of comparable amounts of respective proteins 17 . Both positive and negative modulators that influence translation and maintain certain levels of protein. Eukaryotic gene translation is regulated in the translation level by several components including 5\u2032 UTR [18] [19] [20] ,3\u2032 UTR [21] [22] [23] , poly A tail [24] [25] [26] [27] , cap structure [28] [29] [30] [31] etc. There are multiple regulatory elements within the untranslated regions (UTR) of the mRNA, which are critical for the stability and translation of mRNA into protein 32, 33 . Moreover, the length and secondary structure of 5\u2032-UTR and mutations within the 5\u2032-UTR have been reported to be associated with certain human diseases 34 . The 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) plays a significant role in the regulation of translational efficiency by helping the ribosome to bind the messenger RNA (mRNA) in the proximity of start codon and thus is a main contributor to the cellular proteome 35 . Additionally, certain RNA elements within the 5\u2032 UTR, may change its secondary structure (e.g internal ribosome entry sites (IRES), upstream AUGs or open reading frames (uORFs)) and can be an important contributor of the entire translation rate 36, 37 . Besides, 5\u2032 UTRs can contain sequence elements that can function as binding sites for regulatory proteins 33 .\n\nTill this date, modRNA that been used in pre-clinically in cardiac research using artificial 5'UTR (36 nucleotides) that was first been described by Warren et al. 38 Asrani et al. 39 has used in vitro screening for optimization mRNA 5'UTR to improved expression of Arginase 1 (ARG1). They showed that plasmid-based screening methods do not correlate with protein expression driven by exogenously expressed mRNA and that improved 5'UTR but not 3'UTR appears to be the key driver in protein expression for exogenously delivered mRNA.\n\nWe recently optimized the synthesis 40 and the delivery 4 of modRNA for cardiac delivery use. In the present study, we compared transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of similar tissues to identify, in vivo, a potential 5\u2032 UTR and the elements within 5\u2032 UTR that can enhance the translation post cardiac and hepatic ischemic injury condition.\n\nCharacterizing the ischemic heart transcriptome and proteome.\n\nTo characterize the dynamics of heart LV transcriptome and proteome post MI we analyzed changes in genes expression and proteins level in the LV of mice 4 and 24 hours post MI and compare it to LV from sham operated mice (Fig. 1a) . In total we detected 14,552 genes and 2,397 proteins in our samples. When comparing the two datasets, we found 2272 genes with corresponding proteins.\n\nOut of all genes with corresponding proteins, 239 genes and 120 proteins were Fig. 1e ). While we found a significant correlation between the changes in gene expression and protein levels in the ischemic heart post MI and in our search for a 5\u2032UTR element that may elevate translation of modRNA in the heart post-MI we were interested in identifying genes with significant non-correlation relationship between mRNA and protein expression. Therefore, we screened for genes that encode for proteins with elevated levels in 4 or 24 hours post-MI (fold change > 2) and mRNA downregulated at 4 or 24 hours post-MI (fold change < 0.64) and 5'UTR shorter than 100bp. We were able to identify 3 genes in 4 hours (Fig. 1f) and 18 genes in 24 hours (Fig. 1g) Fig.1b-d) .\n\nTo evaluate the translational efficiency of their 5\u2032UTR, we designed Luc modRNA construct carrying different 5\u2032UTRs taken from the selected genes (Fig 2a) . We then compared the expression of newly designed 5 different Luc modRNA with different 5\u2032UTR to our Luc modRNA that carry artificial 5\u2032UTR (36 nucleotides, Luc -Control), and is commonly used for in vitro modRNA production (Fig. 2b ).\n\nOur In vitro screening showed that all Luc modRNA carrying different 5\u2032UTRs To additionally confirm our finding, we made eGFP modRNA carrying 5\u2032UTR of Ces1d (eGFP-Ces1d) or eGFP modRNA that carry artificial 5\u2032UTR (eGFP -Control), and compared their translation level of eGFP using western blot in neonatal rat CMs. Similar to our previous results, eGFP-Ces1d showed a 22% increase in modRNA translation in comparison to eGFP-control (Fig. 2d) .\n\nWe decided to further evaluate our Luc modRNA carrying different 5\u2032UTRs in an MI mouse model. We selected the Luc-5\u2032UTRs modRNA (Pzp, Serpina 1b and Ces1d) that shown the highest translation in our in vitro assay ( Fig. 2b-d) and we measure their translation at 1, 2 and 3 days post MI (Fig. 2e ). Our analysis revealed that Luc-Ces1d modRNA had a significant (2 fold) higher expression in comparison to Luc-control, or luc modRNA carrying 5\u2032UTR of Pzp or Serpina (Fig. 2f ).\n\nIn the purpose of identify if Ces1d 5'UTR regulate protein translation only in heart ischemic mouse model, we evaluate both Luc-Ces1d or Luc-Control modRNA translation in a non-ischemic heart (Fig. 3a&b ) or ischemic heart mouse models We then wanted to evaluate the role of Ces1d in modRNA translation under ischemic condition in other organs beside the heart. As acute hepatic or renal ischemia may lead to hepatic or renal failure, that may be fatal, we decided to choose both liver and kidney as two representative organs for ischemic disease.\n\nSimilar to the heart, ischemic injury in the liver significantly increases the expression of Luc-Ces1d (4 hours post-delivery) in comparison to Luc-control To identify the RNA element in Ces1d 5\u2032UTR that is responsible for the significant enhancement of translation of modRNA carrying Ces1d 5\u2032UTR, we examined the Ces1d 5\u2032 UTR consensus elements that been conserved between different species (e.g. mouse, rat, pig, Gerbil and Human). Interestingly, 4 out of the 5 elements (Elements, B, C, D and E) were conserved between species (Fig. 5a ).\n\nBased on this information, we designed Luc modRNA construct carrying different 5\u2032UTR element of Ces1d (Elements A-E) and compared its translation ability in neonatal rat CM to Luc-Ces1d (Fig. 5b&c) . Our results indicated a significant reduction in translation ability in elements A, B, C and E, but not in D (Fig. 5c ).\n\nWe hypothesis that element D is the RNA element that responsible for the higher translation ability of Luc-Ces1d. To test our hypothesis, we compared in ischemic heart model the expression of Luc-Ces1d or Luc-Element D with Luc-Control over three days (Fig. 5d ). Our results show that Luc modRNA carrying 5\u2032UTR of Ces1d or Element D has higher translation in comparison to Luc-control ( Fig. 5e ). Intriguingly, Element D alone had a significant higher translation in the heart at day 3 post MI ( Fig. 5d) . Overall, combining the 3 days readout, Luc-Element D has a 2.5 fold higher translation in the heart post MI in comparison to the widely used artificial 5\u2032UTR (Luc-control). However, Luc-Element D failed to increase translation over Ces1d-Luc in liver ischemic injury (Supplemental Fig.   4a&b ) and over Ces1d-Luc or Luc-control in heart non-ischemic injury (Supplemental Fig. 5a&b ).\n\nThe use of modRNA as a gene delivery tool is growing in the field of therapeutic medicine. Our laboratory aims to use modRNA to induce cardiac protection, cardiovascular or cardiac regeneration post myocardial infarction. 8 Zangi et al. 6 have shown that immediate delivery of VEGF-A modRNA in MI mouse model lead to induction of cardiovascular regeneration. A follow up study in large animal show a significant improvement of cardiac functionwhen VEGF-A modRNA was delivered one-week post MI. 41 Recently it was shown that intradermal delivery of VEGF-A modRNA in patients suffering from type 2 diabetes is safe and may promote angiogenesis. 42 VEGF-A modRNA is now been evaluated in phase2a human clinical trails to improve cardiac function in heart failure patients. In parallel, other groups are using modRNA platform in preclinical study of different liver disease to delivery different target genes. The different liver disease models that been used are for Factor IX deficiency hemophilia B 43 , Acute intermittent porphyria 44 , Glycogen storage disease type 1A 45 , Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 46 , Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency 47 , Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1 48 , Urea cycle disorder 49 with target genes of FIX, PBGD, glucose-6-phosphatase, ADAMTS13, SERPINA1, bilirubin-UGT, ornithine transcarbamoylase, respectively. As was described above, both the heart and liver disease are heavily been studied in search for new treatments. One of the obisticle in moving to large animal and clinical trails is the need of large amount of modRNA to transfect human or large animal heart and liver. In addition, due to the short expression of modRNA, the might be a need to deliver the modRNA several times. In order to reduce the need of large amount of modRNA for delivery, we aim to improve modRNA translation, so the amount of protein that been received from the same amount of modRNA will be higher.\n\nSeveral elements within RNA are responsible for the regulation of translation including type of nucleotides, poly A tail length or the structure of 5\u2032 UTR, 3\u2032 UTR, and cap analog. We showed that replacement of pseudouridine with 1-Mpseudouridine results in higher modRNA translation in the heart, of the later. 4 In addition we found that longer poly-A tail can increase the translation of the modRNA in vivo (data unpublished). Here, we describe a unique, first of his kind screen, comparing proteomic and transcriptomic analysis to identify 5'UTR sequence that can increase the translation of modRNA in ischemic condition with comparison to the widely used artificial 5'UTR that has been used in previous modRNA publications. 4-6, 14, 41, 42 Our data shows that there is a positive correlation at both 4 and 24 hours post MI in mRNA levels and protein intensity in the ischemic heart. However, we were able to identify 19 different genes with negative correlation, which their mRNA level was reduced or unchanged while their protein levels was upregulated in 4 and 24 hours post MI. The average length of 5' UTRs is 100 to 220 nucleotides across species. 50 In vertebrates, longer 5' UTRs tend to be associated with poor translation. 51 Therefore, we decided to select 5 genes with the shortest 5'UTR (<100 base pairs) (Fig. 1 ).\n\nNegative correlation between mRNA levels and protein expression has been reported, especially upon internal or external stimuli happens that trigger alteration in translation of specific genes. VEGF has been shown to be a stressinduced protein in many conditions such as hypoxia and hypoglycemia. 52, 53 Other genes whose translation changes in response to stimulation of internal or external signals are PDGF2 and TGF\u03b2 54 . During the embryonic stage, when most of the organ development and cell differentiation takes place, translation regulation plays a significant role by altering the levels of expression of specific mRNA subsets during a certain time frame whereas the bulk of transcripts remain unaffected [55] [56] [57] .\n\nIn our study we were able to identify several 5'UTRs that may allow translation of modRNA in the heart or liver post ischemic injury. Both Pzp and Serpina 1b 5'\n\nUTR shown non-significant and similar translation ability as control 5' UTR sequence, in vivo ( Figure 2e&f ). As our control 5'UTR (Artificial 5'UTR) is the top, most known and commonly used 5'UTR in the mRNA field 6, 41, 58-62 , we believe that this results indicate how well relatively to this premium control, our selected 5'UTR sequences performed.\n\nIn this particular work we focused on the 5'UTR of Ces1d (Fig. 2-4) Several roles of ces1d has been reported to be directly associated with lipid metabolism [63] [64] [65] . As lipid metabolism is an important process for normal heart function. Fatty acids are the preferred substrates under aerobic conditions. 66 As\n\nCes1d association with lipid metabolism and as MI leads to alteration of lipid metabolism, we hypothesize that Ces1d mRNA is been trigger by the ischemic condition in the heart post MI which lead it to translate better. We showed that Element D is the RNA element in Ces1d that is responsible for the elevation in mRNA translation post MI (Fig. 4 ). It will be interesting to evaluate the Element D and Ces1d in different ischemic condition and different organs bedside the heart liver and kidney. The fact that Ced1d gave higher translation in the ischemic heart and liver but not the kidney is interesting as all three organs primarily uses fatty acid oxidation for energy. This may indicate that each organ and physiological condition will need a separate evaluation using similar approach as ours.\n\nIn conclusion, we have identified 5\u2032UTR of Ces1d, and RNA element D in \n\nVentricular rat neonatal CMs (RNCMs) were isolated from 3 to 4 days old Sprague-Dawley rat pups by pierce primary cardiomyocytes isolation kit (Thermo Heart ischemic injury: MI was induced by permanent ligation of the LAD. The left thoracic region was shaved and sterilized. After intubation, the heart was exposed by left thoracotomy. The LAD was ligated with a suture. Mouse hearts without (sham) or with ischemic injury (MI) were collected at 4 and 24 hours post MI (Fig. 1a) . The ischemic area tissue (or equivalent area in sham hearts) were collected and divided into two pieces and snap froze quickly. One half of the ischemic heart tissues were sent for RNAseq while the other half was sent for proteomics analysis to evaluate gene and protein fold change respectively between MI versus sham hearts. When required, we injected 25 \u00b5g modRNA into the infarct border zone immediately after LAD ligation. The thoracotomy and skin were sutured closed in layers. Excess air was removed from the thoracic cavity, and the mouse was removed from ventilation when normal breathing was established.\n\nand median for an hour, 25 ug modRNA was injected into the left lateral lobe in three different injections immediately after clip was removed.\n\nto the renal artery and renal vein. Successful ischemia can be visually confirmed by a gradual uniform darkening of the kidney. Clip was removed after 30 minute and 25 ug of modRNA was injected in the kidney with three injections.\n\nLuc modRNA (25\u00b5g) in a total volume of 60 \u00b5l in TB buffer were delivered via direct injection to the myocardium .The sucrose-citrate buffer contains 20\u00b5l sucrose in nuclease-free water (0.3 g/mL) and 20 \u00b5l citrate (0.1 M, pH 7; Sigma) mixed with 20\u00b5L modRNA. The transfection mixture was directly injected (three individual injections, 20\u00b5l each) into the heart, kidney or liver.\n\nBioluminescence imaging of the transfected cells ( an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Pierce).
