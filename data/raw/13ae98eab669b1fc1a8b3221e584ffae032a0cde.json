{"title": "A Multi-hospital Study in Wuhan, China\uff1aProtective Effects of Non-menopause and Female Hormones on SARS-CoV-2 infection", "body": "Starting from December 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly spread across the world, causing widespread concern. It's worth noting that there was a definite sex difference in the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. According to the recent data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the ratio of male infection to female infection reached 2.7:1 1 . Among 72314 patients in China, the morbidity and case-fatality rates (CFR) (48.6% and 1.7%) of women were significantly lower than those of men (51.4%, 2.8%). More deaths were found in males than females (63.8% over 36.2%) 2 . The mortality rate of women aged 15-49, under the average menopausal age 50, was even lower. These results indicate that females are less susceptible than males, and have better outcomes.\n\nSARS-COV and MERS, \"sisters\" of SAR-CoV-2, also showed sex preference in their infection of humans with males experiencing higher CFR compared to females.\n\nACE2 has been shown to be the receptor of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.\n\nInterestingly, it is expressed more in male lungs than female lungs 3 . Consistently, the expression of ACE2 is downregulated by estrogen E2 4 . This was confirmed in animal experiments, showing that estrogen mitigates the susceptibility and the severity of phenotype for SARS-CoV, while ovariectomy or intervention with estrogen receptor inhibitors increased the mortality of female mice 5 . An anti-virus drug study showed that estrogen receptor inhibitors possess a great potency in antiviral activity screening against MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and other RNA virus, and they also have an anti-Ebola virus effect in mice 6 . These studies suggest that E2 might play a protective role in SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infection with lower susceptibility, severity and better outcomes of their corresponding diseases.

As described below, we found that there are the sex differences in the severity and outcomes of this disease. Also, we showed there is a good correlation between menstruation status/hormone levels and the severity or outcomes of COVID-19. Finally, by examining the association between cytokines related to immunity and inflammation and disease severity, clinical outcomes or E2, we learned that E2 is inversely correlated with the levels of these cytokines. Our results demonstrate that the better clinical outcomes of female COVID-19 patients are well correlated with menstruation status and female hormone levels. were inquired by telephone follow-up with menstrual status and gynecologic history, 435 patients were finally included. The correlation between menstruation status and disease severity or outcomes were analyzed. We also tested serum cytokines related to All rights reserved.

All these samples were measured in the same laboratory. The intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variation were all <15%. The lowest amount of AMH that could be detected with a 95% probability in a sample was 0.01 ng/mL.\n\nThis study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (TJ-IRB20200214).\n\nOral informed consent was obtained from each enrolled patient. The trial has been registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000030015).\n\nContinuous variables were expressed as the means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarized as the counts and percentages in each category. Mann-Whitney U test were applied to continuous variables, chi-square tests and Fisher's exact tests were used for categorical variables as appropriate. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the independent effect of menstruation regularity on prolonging hospitalization time, controlling age, severity and comorbidity. Multiple logistic regression model was used to assess the independent adjusted relationship between menstruation regularity and disease severity controlling age and E2 level. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between E2 and cytokines related to immunity and inflammation. All analyses were conducted with SPSS All rights reserved.

P<0.05 was considered significant.\n\nData were analyzed by statisticians.\n\nTo explore the sex difference in severity and outcomes, a cohort of patients (n=1902) infected with SARS-CoV-2 were recruited from the three branches of Tongji Hospital.\n\nThere were more female patients in mild group (male 412, 44.06%; female 444, 45.92%), approximately the same proportion of female and male patients in severe group (male 486, 51.98%; female 503, 52.02%), and less female patients in critical group (male 37, 3.96%; female 20, 2.07%, p= 0.05). By the end of Mar 8, more female patients (97 ,10.03%) than male patients (85, 9.09%)) had been discharged, and less female patients (16, 1.65%) than male patients (45, 4.81%) had died (p< 0.01). There was a significant difference between male and female patients in the severity and clinical outcomes, while not in the age distribution (eTable 1, eFigure 1).\n\nThese results indicate that female patients are relatively milder and have better outcomes, which are in accordance with recent published articles 1,2 .\n\nThe 509 patients from Tongji hospital and Mobile Cabin hospital were classified into non-severe group (386, 75.8%) and severe group (123, 24.2%) according to the American Thoracic Society guideline for community-acquired pneumonia 8 at admission and the published article of COVID-19 by Nanshan Zhong and his All rights reserved.

In the last 6-12 months, 148 (34%) patients had regular menstrual cycle (21-35days), 36 (8.3%) patients had irregular menstrual cycle (shorter than 21days or longer than 35 days), and 251 (57.7%) patients had entered menopause (amenorrhea more than one year).\n\nIn non-severe group, patients with different menstruation status were 36.1%, 9.9% and 54.0% for regular, irregular and menopause, respectively. In the severe group, while the proportion of regular and irregular decreased to 27% and 3%, respectively, the proportion of menopause increased to 70% (p=0.008; eTable 2). But if age was considered as an adjust variable, the significance was reduced (p= 0.533 All rights reserved.

Patients with non-menopause tended to have lower hospitalization proportion as time passing by and to be discharged earlier than patients with menopause, control age and severity (relative hazard [RH]= 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06 -3.46); eTable 2, Figure 2 ).\n\nThe baseline clinical characteristics of 78 patients agreed to test the serum hormone were shown in eTable 3. Age, phase of menstrual cycle, menstrual regularity in last 6 months and menstrual volumes in last 3 months were similar in terms of COVID-19's severity and composite end points.

Higher levels of IL6 and IL8 were found in the severe group than that in non-severe group (p= 0.040, 0.033; Figure 5 , eTable 4). Higher levels of IL2R, IL6, IL8 and IL10 were also observed in patients with composite end points than patients without composite end points (p\uf03c0.001, \uf03c0.001, 0.009, 0.040; eTable 5).\n\nNo significant correlation between the AMH level and these cytokines were found in this study. The correlation between the E2 level (either in luteal or follicular phase) and the level of these cytokines were shown in Figure 5 and Table S5 . Figure   5 , eTable 5). Collectively, the levels of IL6 and IL8 were positively correlated with COVID-19's severity and composite endpoints. The E2 level was negatively correlated to that of IL6, IL8, IL2R and TNF\u03b1 in luteal phase, and C3 in follicular phase.\n\nIt has remained incompletely understood if sex might significantly impact the All rights reserved.

Here, our study indicated the proportion of severe patients is less in females than that of males. Additionally, the clinical outcomes of female patients were better than that of male patients, which is in accordance with recent studies 1, 2, 9, 10 . Apparently, sexual dimorphisms account for differences in severity and outcomes of infectious diseases between females and males.\n\nPrevious study has indicated that menstruation status and hormonal fluctuation may affect disease symptom severity 11 . Our study as presented here showed that menstrual cycles and volumes are associated with the clinical severity and outcomes.\n\nBut if age was considered as an adjust variable, the significance was reduced, even when the regular and irregular groups were merged into one non-menopause group.\n\nInterestingly, postmenopausal patients have longer length of hospital stays than do non-menopausal females, when considering age and severity. Accordingly, psychiatric hospitalizations for women are significantly greater within 5 days of their last menstrual period 12 . Normal menstruation regularity may be an important protective factor for COVID-19 patients. However, menstruation is often affected by many factors, such as medication, environment and anxiety, aside from the periodic fluctuation of sex hormones.\n\nSex-specific disease outcomes following virus infections are attributed to sexdependent production of steroid hormones, different copy numbers of immune response X-linked genes, and the presence of disease susceptibility genes in males and females 13 . Our data showed that E2 and AMH are positively correlated with the disease severity. E2 is primarily produced in ovaries and considered as the most prevalent and potent form of circulating estrogen. Estrogens are thought to protect non-menopausal women from hepatitis C virus and other pathogens 14, 15 . Also, All rights reserved.

AMH changes slightly with menstrual cycle and drugs and serves as the optimal marker for ovarian reserve and function.\n\nAMH levels were positively associated with the number of oocytes retrieved, ovarian response, E2 and testosterone 16 . Logistics regression analyses showed that the levels of E2 and AMH in non-severe group are higher than that of the severe group, which may play vital roles in the progression of COVID-19. In this study, non-severe females have higher levels of testosterone than do severe patients. Previous studies have shown that testosterone has suppressive effects on immune system, such as on cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation 17 . However, after adjusted by age, the significance became unobvious. In the disease progression of COVID-19, testosterone may work by suppressing immune storms. Our results also indicated that E2 has a stronger protective effect against the potential negative effects from testosterone.\n\nPrevious studies have suggested that high doses of E2 may inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1), whereas stimulation with E2 at its physiological level enhances their production 18, 19 . After viral infection, proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines secreted by macrophages induced various antiviral mechanisms. Several clinical studies reported that levels of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, including IL-6, IL-8, IFN-\u03b3, MCP-1, and IP-10, are highly increased in patients with SARS, some of which were correlated with ARDS, respiratory syncytial virus infections and human infection by avian influenza viruses 20, 21 . In our study, the levels of IL6 and IL8 were negatively related to both disease severity and composite end points, and IL2R and IL10 were related to composite end All rights reserved.

E2 has also been shown to regulate host immune response 17,23-25 . Our results indicated that E2 is negatively associated with C3 in follicular phase, and IL2R, IL6, \n\nThis study has several limitations. First, correlation analysis showed that E2 is negatively correlated with COVID-19's severity, but the causal relationship between them remains unclear. Second, the serum E2 level was just from once blood sample regardless of phase of menstrual cycle, so that the results may not completely reflect the average E2 level and its effects. In order to alleviate this error, we divided menstrual cycle into follicular and luteal phase when analyzed with E2. Third, the sample size of serum sex hormones, 78, might not be large enough. More samples are needed to further determine the relationship of E2 level with the outcomes. All rights reserved.
