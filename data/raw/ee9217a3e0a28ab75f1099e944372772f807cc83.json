{"title": "Coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 causes a persistent, productive infection in primary glial cell cultures", "body": "Mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59), a neurotropic murine coronavirus, is an enveloped positive stranded RNA virus .' After intranasal or intracerebral inoculation of mice, MHV-A59 produces mild acute encephalitis with infection of selected regions of the central nervous system (CNS) and subsequent chronic demyelination .' \u00b0 MHV-A59 infection of mice has been used as an experimental model system to study virusinduced demyelination ; this may be important in the understanding of the pathogenesis of human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) . Studies with MHV-JHM, another neurotropic strain of MHV, have suggested that MHV-induced demyelination is the result of lytic infection of oligodendrocytes, the myelin producing cel ls . 5, 6 We have previously shown that although infectious MHV-A59 and viral antigens are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to detect after the first few weeks post-infection, viral genome persists in the white matter of infected mice during the chronic demyelinating stages of the disease .' These findings, along with the observation that MHV-A59 grows preferentially in non-neuronal (as opposed to neuronal) cells in dissociated spinal cord cultures,' suggest that glial cells may be the site of MHV-A59 persistence during chronic demyelination . A recent report showed that MHV-A59 can productively infect astrocytes in vitro . 9 Thus, as part of our approach to understanding the mechanism of MHV-A59 persistence and its possible relationship to demyelination, we studied the interaction between MHV-A59 and oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in vitro using enriched cultures of each cell type, derived from mice . We have used these cultures to complement ongoing in vivo studies for several reasons : (1) the interaction between virus and cell can be studied isolated from other host factors such as the immune system ; (2) unambiguous identification of cell type with the cell-specific markers is more easily accomplished in vitro than in vivo; and (3) a high percentage of a specific cell type as well as a large number of cells are obtained in each culture ; thus oligodendrocytes and astrocytes can be studied separately . We report here that astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are early sites of MHV-A59 infection in vivo and that glial cells support persistent productive MHV-A59 infection in vitro .\n\nExpression of viral antigen in glial cell cultures . Mixed glial, enriched oligodendrocyte and enriched astrocyte cultures were derived either from newborn or 3 week old C57BL/6 mice as described in 'Materials and methods' .\" Such cultures were infected with MHV-A59 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID) 50/cell and 3 days post-infection were stained by double immunofluorescence for viral antigen and cell-specific markers . Approximately 30% of glial fibrillary acidic protein (G FAP)-positive cells (astrocytes) 73 and 10% of galactocerebroside (GaIC) 14 positive cells (oligodendrocytes) expressed cytoplasmic viral antigens . Figure 1 shows an example of cells that were positive for GaIC and viral antigens . Viral antigen was not detected in control mock-infected cultures or in cultures that were incubated with normal mouse serum . There was no obvious cytopathic effect (CPE) in infected cultures observed with the light microscope (during a period of 45 days) as compared to uninfected cultures and there was no evidence of syncytia formation which is observed in lytic infections of MHV-A59 in vitro in 17CI-1 mouse fibroblasts .\" Thus at least some oligodendrocytes and some astrocytes can be infected by MHV-A59 in vitro .\n\nBecause only 10% of the oligodendrocytes and 30% astrocytes contained viral antigen we wanted to determine whether all cells could be infected . Thus mixed glial cultures were infected with MHV-A59 at MOTs of 0 .1, 1, 5, 50 TCID 50 /cell . The percentage of infected cells did not significantly increase with the higher multiplicities . There was no obvious CPE during an observation period of 1 week .\n\nTo determine whether glial cells may be infected by MHV-A59 in vivo as well, as in vitro, 5-day old mice were infected by intracerebral inoculation with 400 TCID 50 of MHV-A59 (a lethal dose for suckling mice) and sacrificed one day later . Mixed glial (Fig . 2) . In glial cell cultures, at both MOI=1 TCID 50 /cell (Fig . 2) and MO1=50 TCID 50/cell (data not shown), the kinetics of production of infectious virus were similar to the kinetics in 17C1-cells . However the glial cultures were strikingly different in that there was no CPE . The fact that similar titers of virus were produced by cultures infected at MOI of 1 or 50 TCID 50 /cell is consistent with the fact that the percentage of cells expressing viral antigen also did not increase at higher MOIs (see above) .\n\nSince the glial cells were not destroyed by infection, we continued to culture these cells . As shown in Fig . 3 were maintained . There was no CPE observed in any of the cultures for the time courses monitored in Figs 3 and 4, that is up to 45 days for the mixed glial cultures . There were no morphological changes in the cultures that could be correlated with fluctuations in viral titers released .\n\nOligodendrocytes and astrocytes are not only susceptible to MHV-A59 infection in vitro but are also early sites of virus infection in vivo . Mixed glial cultures, enriched astrocyte cultures and enriched oligodendrocyte cultures derived from newborn mice all support persistent, productive infection with MHV-A59, which occurs in the absence of CPE . (We were unable to examine viral antigens and virus production in glial cells extracted from weanling mice, after in vivo infection, because of technical difficulties in deriving such cultures .) Thus, the interaction of MHV-A59 with glial cells is different from that of the virus with 17CI-1 mouse fibroblasts in that the latter cells undergo syncytia formation and subsequent cell lysis within the first day post infection .\n\nOur results suggest that astrocytes are sites of viral persistence in the cultures . The astrocytes cultured from mouse brain divide in culture and the cultures remain > 90% pure for the duration of the experiment as assayed by staining with GFAP . 10 \u2022 1 1 It is more difficult to be sure of the role of oligodendrocytes in viral persistence . Oligodendrocytes do not divide in culture ; thus enriched oligodendrocyte cultures (70-80% pure at 3 days after plating) are only 20-40% GaIC positive at 2 weeks after plating . Although virus production continued for the 2 weeks that the enriched oligodendrocyte cultures were maintained in vitro (Fig . 3) it is difficult to be sure that infectious virus was continually being produced by the oligodendrocytes as the cultures became contaminated with virus-producing fibroblasts and astrocytes . However some of the remaining oligodendrocytes (GaIC positivite cells) did remain positive for viral antigens .\n\nThe non-lytic nature of the interaction between MHV-A59 and glial cells may be either due to host cell factors that modify viral gene expression or to selection of variant virus defective in expression of one or more viral genes . The latter has been shown to be the case in persistent paramyxovirus infections .'\"' The selection of a viral mutant is less likely in MHV-A59 infected glial cells as the virus produced by these cells is lytic in 17CI-1 cells . It is more likely that an interaction of glial host cell factors with virus results in a non-lytic infection . We are investigating viral RNA and protein expression, during MHV persistence in glial cells .\n\nThe outcome of infection of MHV in primary glial cells is dependent on the virus strain, and the age and strain of the mice from which the cultures are derived . In another study of MHV-A59 in primary glial cell cultures, infection was productive and lytic and virtually all the cells contained viral antigen .' This study differed from ours in that the MHV-A59 strain used was at least 30-fold more lethal in mice and a different strain and age of mice was used to derive the cultures . In studies with JHM, a more neuropathogenic MHV strain, chronic productive infections were established in primary glial cells or enriched oligodendrocyte cultures similar to that which we described .\", \" It was shown that resistance to JHM infection in in vitro rat oligodendrocyte cultures was related to the developmental state of the cells . Perhaps the fact that even at high MOIs in our studies only 10-30% of glial cells expressed viral antigen is related to the physiological or developmental state of the cells .\n\nThe facts that viral nucleic acids are restricted to white matter during chronic MHV-A59 infection in mice' and that glial cells undergo persistent productive infection in vitro support the hypothesis that virus persists in glial cells during chronic demyelination . Persistent infection of oligodendrocytes may cause a malfunction of the myelin I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 1 I 1 I I I  20  25 synthesis or may alter myelination by a more indirect, perhaps immune mediated mechanism . Persistent MHV infection of primary glial cells is accompanied by enhancement of H-2 class 1 antigen expression . 20 This could potentially lead to the recognition of infected oligodendrocytes by cytotoxic T lymphocytes that could lyse the oligodendrocytes to cause demyelination . We are currently investigating this idea .\n\nGlial cell cultures . All cultures were derived from C57BL/6 mice obtained from Jackson Laboratories (designated 'MHV-free') . Mixed glial cell cultures were derived from 3 week old mice by mincing and trypsinization of brains followed by filtration through nylon mesh and plating onto tissue culture flasks . Oligodendrocytes were purified from these brains by Percoll gradient centrifugation .\" Alternatively, mixed glial cultures were derived from newborm mice and after 2 weeks in culture were subcultured into enriched astrocytes and enriched oligodendrocyte cultures by the procedure of McCarthy and DeVellis 10 designed for rat glial cells as modified for use with mouse cells .\" Briefly, this involves shaking off of the less adherent oligodendrocytes and replating of these cells onto poly-L-lysine coated cover slips (at a concentration of approximately 5x 10 4 cells per cm 2 ) while the astrocytes remain adherent to the tissue culture plastic . In both cases infections were performed on cells at 3-4 weeks of development . In both cases, cultures were similar in terms of percentage of cells containing viral antigen and amount of infectious virus produced . Because the cells were difficult to obtain routinely from the older mice, most of the experiments were performed on cultures derived from the newborn mice . All cells were grown in Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO 2 . The purity of the cultures was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Cells were stained either with antiserum directed against galactocerebroside (GaIC), an oligodendrocyte specific marker, 14 or antiserum against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocyte specific marker, 13 followed by a secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescein or rhodamine . As defined by staining with these antisera 3 days after plating, oligodendrocyte enriched cultures consisted of more than 80% oligodendrocytes whereas astrocyte enriched cultures consisted of more than 90% astrocytes .\"\n\nInfection of cultures with MHV-A59. Plaque purified MHV-A59 grown in 17CI-1 cells was used in all infections . 3 17Cl-1 cells were infected at MOI=1 TCID 50 /cell and glial cultures were infected 1-3 days after plating with MOIs as indicated . At the time of infection 17Cl-1, mixed glial and astrocyte cultures contained approximately 1 .5x105 cells per cm 2 . Enriched oligodendrocytes contained approximately 5x 10 4 cells per cm 2 . After adsorption for 1 hour at room temperature cultures were washed with phosphate buffered saline three times and fed with warm media . At the indicated intervals post infection, supernatants were collected (replaced with fresh media) and tested for infectious virus by a TCID S\u00b0a ssay in 17CI-1 or L-2 mouse fibroblasts (as indicated) as previously described .\" Titers were approximately the same in both cell types .\n\nInfection in mice . Five day old C57BL/6 mice were infected intracerebrally with 400 TCID 50 of MHV-A59 . One day later brains were removed and mixed glial cultures derived by the techniques of McCarthy and DeVellis16 as described above .\n\nAntigen dection by immunofluorescence . Cultures were stained by immunofluorescence . When staining for oligodendrocytes expressing viral antigens, cells were washed and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-galactocerebroside serum (1 :100 dilution) and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody, then fixed with a acetic acid/ethanol and incubated with mouse polyclonal anti-MHV-A59 (1 : 100 dilution) and fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody .\" When staining for astrocytes expressing viral antigens cells were fixed, stained with rabbit polyclonal, anti glial fibrillary acidic protein serum (1 :150) and rhodomine-conjugated secondary antibody and then stained for viral antigens as above . Cells were then viewed with phase contrast, rhodamine, and ultraviolet fluorescence optics .
