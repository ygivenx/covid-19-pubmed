{"title": "Antimicrobial activity of novel synthesized coumarin based transitional metal complexes", "body": "Objectives: To synthesize new transitional metal complexes derived from 3-aryl-azo-4-hydroxy coumarin analogues and to evaluate their antimicrobial activities.\n\nMethods: The syntheses of complexes of coumarin analogues were accomplished by mixing a hydro-alcoholic solution of 3-aryl-azo-4-hydroxy coumarin analogues with transition metal chlorides. The structural environment of the synthesized molecules was characterized using different instrumental methods. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds was determined by the agar well diffusion method.\n\nResults: The cobalt complexes of (E)-3-((4-chlorophenyl) diazenyl)-4-hydroxy-2H-chromen-2-one (HL 1 ): (4a) and (E)-3-((4-methoxyphenyl) diazenyl)-4-hydroxy-2H-chromen-2-one (HL 2 ): (4e) showed excellent antimicrobial activities compared with their ligands.\n\nThe reports of the antimicrobial investigation showed that the cobalt complexes of 3-aryl-azo-4hydroxy coumarin analogues exhibited potential antimicrobial activity that was stronger than that of their ligands.\n\nDue to the increasing number of multi-drug-resistant microbial pathogens and the inclusion of emerging infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza, the treatment of microbial infections still remains a challenging job with the available antimicrobials and remains a worldwide problem for clinical management. 1 Development of newer molecules with less expense and minimum toxicity for the management of infections due to multi-drug-resistant (MDR) microbial pathogens should represent the vital sphere of antimicrobial research today. A literature survey revealed that azo molecules are popular for versatile uses such as antiseptics, 2 antimicrobial, 3 antidiabetics, 4 antineoplastics, 5 transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, 6 antiulcerative, 7 antoxidant, 8 analgesic, 9 antiinflammatory, 10 antiviral, 11 antitubercular 10 and antitumour 12 activities.\n\nA literature survey also revealed that azo-bearing ligands have a modified therapeutic effect when combined with transition metal ions. 13, 14 The complexes of transition metals have significant biological functions including antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer activities. 15 Cobalt, copper, nickel and zinc are the potentially used metal ions that form low-molecular-weight complexes, which are found to be effective against various diseases. Literature support even suggests that metal complexes are more active than their ligands because the metal complexes serve as a vehicle for activation of the ligands as principal cytotoxic species. 16, 17 The biological aspects of metallic ligands depend upon the ease of cleaving the bond between the metal ion and the ligand. It is well known that the metals present in complexes generally accelerate the drug action and the efficacy of therapeutic agents and that the pharmacological efficiencies of drug-based metal complexes depend upon the nature of the metal ion and the ligands. 18 The present work is the continuation of our previously reported work to obtain some novel complexes where the 4-chlorophenyl and 4methoxyphenyl substituted 4-hydroxycumarin azoanalogues are conjugated with different transitional metals with an intention to produce target molecules possessing good antimicrobial properties. 3, 19 \n\nAll the chemicals used in the present studies were of synthetic grade and were obtained from Merck specialties Ltd. and HiMedia laboratories Pvt. Ltd, (Mumbai, India). The prepared products were analysed by FT/IR (JASCO FT/IR 4100 Spectrophotometer) using KBr pellets. An LC-MS column C 6 (150 mm \u00c2 4.6 mm) with a 5 mm particle size (Shimadzu-Mass spectrophotometer) was used. The 1 H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 1 H NMR 400 MHz using tetramethylsilane as an internal standard, and the chemical shifts were reported in d ppm. The UV (Jasco V-630 Spectrophotometer) and elemental analyses for C, H, N and S were performed on a Perkin Elmer model 2400 CHNS/O analyser. A Shimadzu XRD 7000 was used for the study of the structural environment of the synthesized ligands and their metal complexes. The Faraday balance technique was employed for the measurement of magnetic susceptibility of the metal complexes. The in vitro antimicrobial activities against different bacterial and fungal pathogens were determined by the agar well diffusion method, sourced from IMTECH, India, Chandigarh.\n\nThe synthetic procedures yielding the ligands (E)-3-((4chlorophenyl) diazenyl)-4-hydroxy-2H-chromen-2-one (HL 1 ): (3a) and (E)-3-((4-methoxyphenyl) diazenyl)-4-hydroxy-2Hchromen-2-one (HL 2 ): (3b) were carried out as described previously. 3 Synthesis procedure of metal complexes (4ae4h) 20 A mixture of 25 mL was prepared with the appropriate metal chloride (Cu(II), Ni(II), Co(II) and Zn(II) of 10 mmol in ethanol and water, 1:1). The above mixture was added to the solution of azo compound 3ae3b (0.40 g, 10 mmol) in ethanol and water in equal proportions to obtain 50 mL of solution. The resulting solution was refluxed for 30 min at a controlled temperature not more than 78 C. The precipitated complexes were separated by filtration using Whatman filter paper. Separated precipitates were washed with 1:1 ethanol-water. Finally, obtained products were recrystallized from diethyl ether and air dried.\n\nOff yellow-coloured powder; yield 91%; Rf: 0.7; m.p.: \n\nThe above newly synthesized 4-HC azo-analogues and their metal complexes were investigated over different freshly sub cultured microbial strains, viz. Escherichia coli (MTCC 614), Klebsiella pneumonia (MTCC 109) and Candida albicans (MTCC 3017), that were procured from the Institute of Microbial Technology and Gene bank (IMTECH), Chandigarh, India. Staphylococcus aureus and Cryptococcus neoformans were obtained from the University Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utkal University. Ampicillin and fluconazole were used as reference antibiotics.\n\nThe antimicrobial diffusion test was performed using a cell suspension of approximately 1.5 \u00c2 10 6 CFU mL \u00c01 employing a McFarland turbidity standard No. 0.5. The antimicrobial activities of the novel 4-HC analogues (3ae3b) and the reported complexes (4ae4g) were determined by the agar well diffusion method using sterile molten nutrient agar (antibacterial activity) preparations of the compounds and Sabouraud dextrose agar (antifungal activity) preparations of compound 4d and their respective complexes. 9\n\nA 1 mg mL \u00c01 stock solution of each of the synthesized compounds and reference antibiotic was prepared using DMF. Further, five different concentrations (500e 31.25 mg mL \u00c01 ) were prepared by the serial dilution method.\n\nThe different concentrations for the respective compounds were loaded into the wells and incubated at 37 C for 18e 24 h. After incubation, the MIC was determined. 9 Acute toxicity study The said synthesized compounds were subjected to an acute oral toxicity study to establish their safety dose. Healthy young female Wister rats that were 8e12 weeks of age were selected. OECD guideline No. 420 (2000) for the acute oral toxicity fixed dose procedure of the test compounds (3ae3b and 4ae4h) was followed. To conduct the sighting study, a single animal was provided with suspensions of the synthesized compounds having a specific dose, viz. 5 mg, 50 mg, 300 mg and 2000 mg/kg body weight, with the aid of an intubation canula. A period of 24 h was maintained between each dosing. In the main study, another 4 animals were administered 2000 mg/kg. The animals were observed for a period of 14 days. However, the acute toxic symptoms and the behavioural changes produced by the test compounds were observed continuously at an interval of 4 h up to 24 h.\n\nThe observed data on the zone of inhibitions were subjected to a one way analysis of variance. The mean zone of inhibition for each compound on each strain was compared with the reference antibiotic through a Dunnett Post Hoc test (https://www.statstodo.com/SSizAOV_Pgm.php). The test of significance was performed at the 5% level of type one error. The research hypothesis was 'the zone of inhibition for the test compound was higher than the reference antibiotics' against the hypothesis of no difference (null hypotheses), which states that there is no significant difference between the zone of inhibition of the test compound and the reference antibiotics.\n\nA minimum sample size of five was calculated taking the probability of type 1 error (d) \u00bc 0.05, Power (1-b) \u00bc 0.8, Number of groups \u00bc 13 within group SD \u00bc 2. However, a sample size of six has been taken in the study for each compound against each strain.\n\nThe metal complexes of 3-aryl-azo-4-hydroxy coumarin analogues were synthesized by refluxing different hydro alcoholic solutions of metal chlorides with 3-(4-chloro phenyl/4-methoxy phenyl)-azo-4-hydroxy coumarin analogues (Scheme 1) and finally re-crystallized from diethyl ether. The structures of the prepared compounds are confirmed by different instrumental methods of analysis. The physical characteristics of the synthesized compounds are reported in Table 1 . The FT/IR spectra of synthesized ligands 3a and 3b showed strong vibration bands at 3479e 3445 cm \u00c01 , 1619e1603 cm \u00c01 , 1726e1745 cm \u00c01 , 1298e 1246 cm \u00c01 and 1529e1505 cm \u00c01 due to presence of functional groups such as OH str., C]C str., C]O str., CeO str. and N]N str., respectively. The strong vibration bands of compound 3a at 1726, 1619 and 1298 cm \u00c01 may be due to presence of a lactone carbonyl of C]O str., C] C str. and ]CeO str., respectively, and are illustrated in Figure 1 . The frequencies of all the complexes (4ae4h) assigned at 1629e1613 cm \u00c01 , 1729e1721 cm \u00c01 , 1296e 1248 cm \u00c01 and 1529e1524 cm \u00c01 correspond to C]C str., C]O str., CeO str. and N]N str., respectively. The IR spectral bands of all metal complexes appearing at 451e441 and 538e531 cm \u00c01 are assigned to (M\u00c0N) and (M\u00c0O), respectively. The 1 H NMR spectra of the ligands showed a broad singlet at d 16.81e16.86 ppm towards the presence of the enolic OH group of 4-hydroxy coumarin. The 1 H NMR spectrum of compound 3b showed a sharp singlet at d 3.83 ppm corresponding to the proton of eOCH 3 ( Figure 2 ). All of the complexes showed signals at a range of (6.90e7.26)e(7.23e7.37) ppm corresponding to {m, 8H, (C 6 H 4 ) 2 }.\n\nThe magnetic susceptibility of the Co(II) complex is 5.09 BM, which is nearer to the reported value for octahedral symmetry. 21 The Ni(II) complex showed a magnetic moment of 2.94 BM, whereas the Cu(II) complex showed a magnetic moment of 1.98 BM, suggesting an octahedral geometry. Compounds 3ae3b act as bidentate ligands by coordinating to the transitional metal ions through their azo and enolic hydroxyl moiety. Based upon the study of magnetic susceptibility values of the complexes, the probable structure is given in Scheme 1.\n\nThe predicted molecular weights of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by LCeMS and the results are summarized in Table 1 . Compound 3a possesses a molecular ion peak at 301.2 m/z that strongly reveals the predicted molecular formula C 15 H 9 ClN 2 O 3 that is reported in Figure 4 .\n\nThe UV spectroscopic analyses of the synthesized ligands and complexes revealed that complexes 4a and 4e demonstrated a good bathochromic shift at 463 and 450 nm, whereas ligands 3a and 3b possessed a l max at 409 and 413 nm, respectively. The solvent effect of the ligands and their respective complexes are spectrally presented in Figure 3 .\n\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique provides the most definitive structural information. The study of the XRD pattern of the synthesized complexes was performed using a Cu Ka X-ray source and a step of 0.02 (2q) and run at 2q \u00bc 2e80 using a Shimadzu XRD 7000 instrument at a scanning speed of 2.000 (deg/min). Using Origin data analysis software, the structures of the obtained complexes were interpreted. The pattern and the number of reflections reported in Figure 5 clearly declared the structural difference of compounds 4e and 4f.\n\nThe results of the antimicrobial activity of the newly synthesized 3-aryl-azo-4-hydroxy coumarin analogues and their complexes compared with reference antibiotics (RA) ampicillin and fluconazole (as antibacterial and antifungal standard drugs, respectively) expressed in mean AE SD are reported in Table 2 . The reported results revealed that compounds 4a and 4e showed significant antimicrobial activity in comparison to standard drugs (p < 0.05) against E. coli, K. pneumonia, S. aureus, C. albicans and C. neoformans. All compounds except for 4d and 4h showed significant antibacterial activity against S. aureus. However, complex 4a showed highest mean zone of inhibition (mm) against K. pneumonia and C. neoformans, 19 AE 1.1 and 27.5 AE 1.64, respectively. The largest mean zones of inhibition exhibited by complex 4e against S. aureus and C. neoformans was 23 AE 2.28 and 28.17 AE 1.72, respectively. The anti-biogram pattern of compound 3a, 3b and their complexes against different fungal strains are illustrated in Figure 6 . The graphical representation of complexes 4a and 4e is illustrated in Figure 7 .\n\nThe inhibitory property of the compounds was determined in terms of MIC (mg mL \u00c01 ). The Co \u00fe\u00fe complexes of both the ligands showed the antimicrobial activity against all the selected strains at MIC level 31.25 mg mL \u00c01 . All compounds except for 4d and 4h showed a zone of inhibition at the MIC level 31.25 mg mL \u00c01 against C. albicans (Table 3) .\n\nNo mortality was found for all of the test compounds per the results of the toxicity study. The synthesized compounds were safe up to 2000 mg/kg body weight. No significant change in the body weight of the animals was observed. No toxic symptoms and gross behavioural changes were observed in the animals.\n\nThe FT/IR spectra of synthesized ligands 3a and 3b showed vibrations at 1619e1603 cm \u00c01 , 1726e1745 cm \u00c01 , 1298e1246 cm \u00c01 and 1529e1505 cm \u00c01 corresponding to C]C str., C]O str., CeO str. and N]N str., respectively, which were also observed in the synthesized complexes (4ae 4h). The only exception is the bands due to OH str. at 3479e 3445 cm \u00c01 exhibited in the ligands that are not observable in the complexes. In metal Cu(II), Ni(II) Co(II) and Zn(II) complexes of 3a and 3b, the FT/IR absorption band due to the hydroxyl group at 4-HC has been diminished and indicates the metal co-ordination of the OH group via deprotonation due to liberation of hydrochloric acid. In addition to these FT/IR spectral data, stretching of the M\u00c0N and M\u00c0O bonds of the complexes, which appear in the higher frequency wavenumber region in the range 451e441 and 538e531 cm \u00c01 , also indicates that complexation occurred through nitrogen and oxygen atoms from the azo-enolic ligands. 22, 23 The 1 H NMR spectra of ligands 3a and 3b showed the enolic OH peak at 16.81 and 16.86 ppm. The disappearance of the enolic OH group in all the complexes (4ae4h) may be due to the interaction of metal chlorides Scheme 1: Synthesis of coumarin based transitional metal complexes. with the hydroxyl group of the ligands resulting in deprotonation and complexation of the ligands to the metal ions. Ligand 3b shows three identical, similarenvironment protons at 3.83 ppm, which indicates the presence of an eOCH 3 functional group. The good bathochromic shift at 463 and 450 nm exhibited by complexes 4a and 4e may be due to the attachment of transition metal ion Co \u00fe\u00fe to the respective ligands 3a and 3b. Most of the compounds showed good antimicrobial activity in comparison to ampicillin. The enhanced antimicrobial activity exhibited by complexes 4a, 4b, 4e and 4f relative to their ligands against E. coli may be due to coordination of Co \u00fe\u00fe and Ni \u00fe\u00fe ions to the respective ligands 3a and 3b. However, complexes 4a and 4e showed considerably enhanced antimicrobial activity against most of the pathogenic strains relative to their ligands. Complexation reduces the polarity of the metal ion by coordinating with ligands and increases the lipophilicity of the metals. 24 Thus, it facilitates the penetration of the novel synthesized complexes into the lipoid cell membrane of microorganisms and inhibits their growth. The limitations of our study include only the investigation of antimicrobial activity of the novel synthesized complexes against a few bacterial and fungal strains. Furthermore, it is necessary to investigate the antimicrobial activities of the novel complexes against multidrug-resistant microorganisms.\n\nA literature survey revealed that the metal complexes serve as vehicles for activation of the ligands as principal cytotoxic species. Therefore, these complexes may be implemented for the investigation of cytotoxic activity against different cancer cell lines. "}
