Coronaviruses are members of the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. The recent emergence of a novel coronavirus with an outbreak of unusual viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China and then pandemic outbreak is 2019-nCoV or COVID- 19 . Based on its phylogenetic relationships and genomic structures the COVID-19 belongs to genera Betacoronavirus which has a close similarity of the sequences of COVID19 to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) and the virus uses ACE2 as the entry receptor-like SARS-CoV (2) . These similarities of the SARS-CoV-2 to the one that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoVs) the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses termed the virus as SARS-CoV-2 (3) .The understanding of the genetic and phenotypic structure of COVID-19 in pathogenesis is important for the production of drugs and vaccines. So, in this review article, we provide the newest genetic and phenotype features of COVID-19 to investigate the role of these two factors in the pathogenesis and comparing it with its families.\n\nCOVID-19 is a spherical or pleomorphic enveloped particles containing single-stranded \n\nSpike and allows COVID-19 to enter and infect cells. In order for the virus to complete entry into the cell following this initial process, the spike protein has to be primed by an enzyme called a protease. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) uses a protease called TMPRSS2 to complete this process (10, 11) . In order to attach virus receptor (spike protein) to its cellular ligand (ACE2), activation by TMPRSS2 as a protease is needed (Figure 4 ) (10). After the virus enters the host cell and uncoats, the genome is transcribed and then translated. Coronavirus genome replication and transcription takes place at cytoplasmic membranes and involve coordinated processes of both continuous and discontinuous RNA synthesis that are mediated by the viral replicate, a huge protein complex encoded by the 20-kb replicase gene (12) . The replicase complex is believed to be comprised of up to 16 viral subunits and a number of cellular proteins. Besides RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RNA helicase, and protease activities, which are common to RNA viruses, the coronavirus replicase was recently predicted to employ a variety of RNA processing enzymes that are not (or extremely rarely) found in other RNA viruses and include putative sequencespecific endoribonuclease, 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease, 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferase, ADP ribose 1\u2032-phosphatase and, in a subset of group 2 coronaviruses, cyclic phosphodiesterase activities (13, 14) . The proteins are assembled at the cell membrane and genomic RNA is incorporated as the mature particle forms by budding from the internal cell membranes (15) .\n\nCo-morbidities are cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease as well as diabetes. Several abnormalities also have been observed including cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocardia injury, hepatic and kidney injury, and secondary bacterial infection (16) . In the majority of cases of severe disease and death, lymphopenia and sustained inflammation have been recorded. Notably, these observations in COVID-19\n\npatients are similar to those who suffered from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2003 epidemic. There may be a biological mechanism behind this epidemiological anomaly (17) . Considering that, in the in vitro study, antiviral therapies are design based on S protein include RBD-ACE2 blockers, S cleavage inhibitors, fusion core blockers, neutralizing antibodies, protease inhibitors, S protein inhibitors, and small interfering RNAs (18) . There are some recombinant compounds such as IFN with ribaverin which has only limited effects against COVID-19 infection(1). The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity for ACE2, while it is a lower affinity for SARS-CoV (1, 19) . Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and its homologue ACE2, belongs to the ACE family of dipeptidylcarboxy dipeptidase. However, their physiological functions are varied. On the other hand, ACE2 serves as the binding site for COVID-19. Based on this information, Gurwitz suggested using available angiotensin receptor 1(AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the severity of COVID-19 infections (20) . At present therapy is based on identifying and developing monoclonal antibodies that are specific and effective against COVID-19 combines with remdesivir as a novel nucleotide analog prodrug that was used for the treatment of the Ebola virus disease (17, 21) . To understand the rate of virus spread among people, it is crucial to figure out whether COVID-19 is mutating to improve its binding to human receptors for infection considering its high mutation rate. Any adaptation in the COVID-19 sequence that might make it more efficient at transmitting among people might also boost its virulence (22) . The COVID-19 is expected to become less virulent through human to human transmissions due to genetic bottlenecks for RNA viruses often occur during respiratory droplet transmissions (3) .\n\nAt present, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19. Given the high rate of transmission of this virus between humans and its pandemics, it is important to identify the basis of its replication, structure, and pathogenicity for discovering a way to the special treatment or the prevention. Due to the high similarity of the virus to its families, efforts have been made to provide medicines and vaccines for COVID-19. Differences in the length of the spike as it is longer in COVID-19 are likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis and treatment of this virus. However, identifying the specific molecular details of the virus is helpful in achieving treatment goals."}
