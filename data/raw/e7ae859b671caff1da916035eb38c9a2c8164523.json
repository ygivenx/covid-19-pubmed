{"title": "Comparison of Two Multiplex Methods for Detection of Respiratory Viruses: FilmArray RP and xTAG RVP \u1c14 \u2020", "body": "Multiplex reverse transcriptase respiratory virus PCR has been shown to be more sensitive than standard respiratory virus culture, direct fluorescent-antigen, and direct enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antigen detection methods (1, 2, 7-9, 13-14, 16, 20) . Viral culture is labor-intensive, detects some viruses (e.g., rhinovirus and coronavirus) poorly, and requires 3 to 5 days to detect most agents. Consequently, results are generally not available early in the clinical decisionmaking process. Direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) and chromatographic immunoassays are rapid enough to support real-time clinical decisions, but DFA is highly labor-intensive and chromatographic immunoassays are relatively insensitive. The FilmArray RP multiplex respiratory virus panel uses a pouch system that contains all reagents for the identification of 18 respiratory viruses and 3 bacterial respiratory pathogens in about 1 h after inoculation of a patient sample, obviating both labor and turnaround time (TAT) issues. We compared the performance of the FilmArray RP with that of the FDAcleared Luminex xTAG RVP multiplex panel by using 200 retrospective clinical respiratory virus culture samples. . Both assays include internal controls for amplification and extraction and were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, following training by the respective companies. The FilmArray RP pouch contains dried reagents for all the steps needed for extraction, PCR amplification, and detection of the respiratory viruses listed above. As shown in Fig. 1 , the pouch is rehydrated under negative pressure with 1 ml molecular reagent-grade water in the reagent port. Two hundred fifty microliters of sample is diluted into 0.5 ml sample buffer, of which 300 l is injected into the sample port. The pouch is then placed in the FilmArray RP instrument and identified by bar code, and the assay is started. Results are available in about an hour. For the xTAG RVP, nucleic acid extraction with the addition of an extraction control was done with a Roche MagNA Pure compact instrument using a 200-l sample eluted in 50 l, of which 5 l was used for the assay. The remaining extracted nucleic acid and aliquots of the original frozen specimen were stored at \u03ea70\u00b0C for further testing. The xTAG is currently FDA cleared only for nasopharyngeal swabs and extraction with the bioM\u00e9rieux EasyMag, the bioM\u00e9rieux MiniMag, and the Qiagen QIAamp MiniElute.\n\nSince the FilmArray RP requires approximately 1 h, we could test only 6 to 8 samples per day shift with 1 instrument. Therefore, the corresponding xTAG RVP assays were performed in batches of 20 to 24 within a 3-day time period, rotating the timing of the xTAG RVP so that it was equally distributed at the beginning, middle, and end of the period.\n\nResolution of discordant results. \"No agreement\" was defined as one or more viruses being detected by one molecular method when no viruses were detected by the other method. \"Essential agreement\" was defined as at least one virus being the same with both methods if either method detected more than one virus. Viruses that were \"equivocal\" by xTAG RVP (i.e., mean fluorescence intensity [MFI] of 150 to 299) were considered positive for statistical purposes, since these results would be reported to physicians as such. Viruses not included in the xTAG RVP, i.e., coronavirus and bocavirus, that were identified by the Film-Array RP were not considered discordant between the two methods.\n\nDiscordant results were resolved by repeat testing in our laboratory of the original or remaining extracted samples by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and TaqMan probes (Biosearch Technologies, Inc., Novato, CA) based on published studies (10) (11) (12) 15 ). If probes were not available, the PCR products were confirmed by automated sequencing of PCR products at the University of Florida Biotechnology Core facility using an Applied Biosystems model 3130 Genetic Analyzer. To confirm the influenza virus, CDC primers were modified as follows and the product sequenced: sense, CAAGACCRATCCTGTCACCTCTGAC; antisense, GATCACTTGAATCGY TGCATCT. Coronavirus (10) and bocavirus (12) were confirmed using sequences from published methods as referenced.\n\nStatistics. The Kappa statistic was calculated from www.graphpad.com /quickcalcs/Kappa2.cfm. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated using the confirmed results as the gold standard at www.chestx-ray.com/statistics/twobytwo .html. McNemar's test was calculated at www.fon.hum.uva.nl/Service/Statistics /McNemars_test.html. These sites were accessible as of 30 March 2011.\n\nBoth the FilmArray RP and the xTAG RVP detected significantly more viruses than standard culture and ELISA antigen methods. The great majority of these additional viruses were rhinovirus/enterovirus, which are poorly detected in culture, and human metapneumovirus, which was not specifically tested for in tissue culture (P \u03fd 0.00001 for culture versus both FilmArray RP and xTAG RVP). These data are shown in Table 1 .\n\nComplete agreement between the FilmArray RP and the xTAG RVP was found for 183/200 (91.5%) of specimens (kappa \u03ed 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.90), and Table 3 footnotes for details). With 8 samples, there was no agreement between the FilmArray RP and the xTAG RVP. The FilmArray RP was positive and the xTAG RVP was negative for 1 or more agents in 6 cases, while the xTAG RVP was positive with a negative FilmArray RP in 2 instances. Nine samples had multiple viruses, in which the FilmArray RP detected a total of 8 additional viruses, while the xTAG RVP detected 2 not found by the FilmArray RP. The FilmArray RP detected 8 RSVs while the corresponding xTAG RVP was negative (n \u03ed 4), or it was negative for RSV when one or more other viruses were detected by the xTAG RVP (P \u03ed 0.007813 by McNemar's test). Detection of RSV by the FilmArray RP but not the xTAG RVP suggests either that the FilmArray RP is more sensitive or that there could be sequence differences that are picked up in one method but not the other. In the former case, one would expect quantitation to show low titers on average, while in the latter, the quantity of virus should match that of the overall population. For this reason, we compared the semiquantitative cycle threshold (C T ) available from the FilmArray RP with the MFI of the xTAG RVP for the RSV-positive specimens (Fig. 2) . The FilmArray RP RSV-positive/xTAG RVP-negative specimens cluster in the high C T range, suggesting that the discrepancy in RSV detection in most samples may have been due to low levels of virus.\n\nThe sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated using the resolved results as the gold standard and are shown in Table 4 .\n\nThe FilmArray RP also detects coronavirus and bocavirus virus as well as Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Coronavirus was detected in 3 specimens, which was confirmed by PCR (10), and bocavirus virus was detected in 6, all of which were also confirmed by PCR (12) . B. pertussis was found in 3 patients, all of whose infections had been suspected and treated on clinical grounds. All three were confirmed by culture or molecular methods in other laboratories. No Mycoplasma or Chlamydophila was detected.\n\nBoth the FilmArray RP and the xTAG RVP performed well, with failure rates of 3% and 2%, respectively. In the FilmArray RP this rate was a result of failure of the vacuum seal, so that the vacuum did not function to rehydrate the pouch, and in the xTAG RVP, it was due to internal control failure.\n\nBoth the FilmArray RP and the xTAG RVP detected significantly more viruses than standard viral culture and antigen detection methods, primarily rhinoviruses/enteroviruses and human metapneumovirus. Numerous studies have also observed increased rates of virus detection when PCR is compared with culture and direct antigen detection methods, whether the PCRs are single or multiplexed (1, 2, 7-9, 13, 14, 16, 20) . The FilmArray RP appeared to detect more total viruses and more RSVs than the xTAG RVP; in 6 instances (4 RSV and 2 rhinovirus) the xTAG RVP was negative, while in the other 9 instances, the xTAG RVP was positive for at least 1 of the 2 or 3 viruses found in the FilmArray RP. Pabbaraju et al. (17) also noted a greater number of positive RSV results using an in-house PCR than found by the xTAG RVP (92 versus 78, in 9 of which RSV was a single positive result). Although the experiments were not definitive, most of the discordant RSVs in our study had low titers in the FilmArray RP, suggesting a higher sensitivity in the FilmArray RP rather than lack of amplification due to RSV sequence differences detected by the FilmArray RP but not by the xTAG RVP. Were the latter the case, one would expect the distribution of C T s in the FilmArray RP to be similar to that of the entire group, which they clearly are not (Fig. 2) . Pabbaraju et al. (17) also observed that their discordant RSVs were of low titer as well.\n\nMixed viral infections were common and were found in 22/138 (15.9%) positive results in the FilmArray RP and in 16/132 (12.1%) in the xTAG RVP, in line with what others have reported. We did not have clinical information to look into whether mixed infections were of greater severity than single infections as has been reported by others (3, 4, 18, 19, 21) . The xTAG RVP does not report quantitative results, but \"mean fluorescence intensity\" (MFI) is available. The research version of the FilmArray RP has a cycle threshold (C T ), although this number only indirectly measures the initial amount of virus present and is not planned for the clinical product. However, as shown in Fig. 2 for RSV, the xTAG RVP MFI and the FilmArray RP C T do show a general correlation, but the range is somewhat less than in typical single real-time PCR assays. RSV titers in infants have been reported to be high on admission and to fall approximately 2 log 10 units over a 7-to 8-day hospitalization (5) as symptoms improve. This pattern was also observed for infection with human rhinovirus (HRV) as a single agent, but when either RSV or HRV was found in low titer on admission as part of a dual infection, its titer tended to remain unchanged over the course of hospitalization, while that of the higher-titer coinfecting virus fell as it did with single-virus infections (6) . It will be important for future studies to define the natural course of viral titers in both single and multiple viral infections when antiviral treatment is given. In view of the extensive clinical experience with the responses of HIV and HCV viral loads to antiviral treatment, it is likely that clinicians will want to apply this paradigm to the treatment of respiratory viral disease.\n\nThe xTAG RVP requires 5 to 6 h to complete, including separate reverse transcriptase, PCR, and linking steps to attach the PCR product to the Luminex beads before the results can be read. Logistically, the process takes an entire workday or has to be split into 2 half-day sessions. The test also requires approximately 2.5 to 3 h of actual hands-on time, as well as meticulous technique to prevent cross contamination in the open system. We found it necessary to aliquot reconstituted reagents and store them at \u03ea70\u00b0C between runs to maintain reagent quality and reliability. In contrast, the FilmArray RP requires 3 to 5 min of hands-on time to inoculate the pouch, read a bar code, and load the instrument. Results are available in about an hour, but only one test at a time can be run as the system is presently configured. The list price for the FilmArray RP is $129/test, but this includes essentially everything necessary to perform the assay. The xTAG RVP lists for $120/test, but the extraction kits and positive-control material have to be purchased separately. The ease of use (literally 3 to 5 min of hands-on time) and rapid turnaround time (TAT) were remarkable features of the FilmArray RP. However, since only one sample can be processed at a time, in its current format, the FilmArray RP may be suitable for low-to moderate-volume laboratories but would have only an adjunctive role in high-volume laboratories.
