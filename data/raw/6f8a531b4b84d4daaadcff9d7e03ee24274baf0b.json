{"title": "Etiology of fever in Ugandan children: identification of microbial pathogens using 1 metagenomic next-generation sequencing and IDseq, a platform for unbiased metagenomic 2 analysis 3 4", "body": "The evaluation of children with fever is challenging, particularly in the developing world. Within the species rhinovirus, we assembled de novo a total of 13 HRV-C (mean 198 coverage: 39-fold) and 13 HRV-A (mean coverage: 268-fold) genomes (> 500 bp (Figure 4) ). Of 199 these, 10 HRV-A and 9 HRV-C genomes had complete coverage of the VP1 region, which is 200 used to define enterovirus types [19] . HRV types are defined by divergence of >73% in the VP1 201 gene. As such, we found three HRV-A and eight HRV-C types in this cohort. One individual 202 harbored two distinct HRV-A types (genome pairwise identity=75.3%, VP1 pairwise 203 identity=67.1%). Additionally, we assembled two novel HRV-C isolates from two patients 204 admitted with gastroenteritis (patient ID: EOFI-014), and pneumonia, malaria and diarrhea 205 Using mNGS and IDseq, the most common pathogen identified in the blood of febrile 264\n\nUgandan children was P. falciparum, an expected result considering the high incidence of 265 malaria in Tororo District at the time of this study [33] . Some discrepancies were seen compared 266 to blood smear readings, with false positive smears probably due to errors in slide reading, a 267 common problem in African clinics [34] , and false negative smears due to the expected greater 268 sensitivity of mNGS for identification of P. falciparum. In children with only sub-microscopic 269 parasitemia, it is uncertain whether fevers can be ascribed to malaria, and in fact many children 270 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Three children had genotypic 318 evidence of ESBL producing organisms predicted to be resistant to ceftriaxone, a frontline 319 antibiotic for severe infections in this region [53] . In addition, one of these three children carried 320 IMP-1, which also confers resistance to carbapenems, a class of antibiotics reserved for the most 321 resistant infections. 322 323 Our exploratory pilot study had important limitations. First, our samples were not 324 collected randomly, but rather were a convenience sample due to the logistical constraints of our 325 small clinical study; as such the results should not be seen as broadly representative of pathogens 326\n\ninfecting Ugandan children. In particular, the lack of identification of bacteremia in study 327 subjects may have been due to a relative paucity of severe illness, compared to that in other 328 studies, in our cohort of admitted children. Second, clinical evaluation of children followed the 329 standards of a rural African hospital, so diagnostic evaluation was limited to physical 330 examination and malaria blood smears. Much more may be learned by linking rigorous clinical 331 evaluation with mNGS results, and thereby more comprehensively assessing associations 332 between clinical syndromes and specific pathogens. \n\nWe studied children admitted to Tororo District Hospital, Tororo, Uganda, with febrile 357 illnesses. Potential subjects were identified by clinic staff, who notified study personnel, who 358 subsequently evaluated the children for study eligibility. Inclusion criteria were: 1) age 2-60 359 months; 2) admission to Tororo District Hospital for acute illness; 3) documentation of axillary 360 temperature >38.0\u00b0C on admission or within 24 hours of admission; and 4) provision of 361 informed consent from the parent or guardian for study procedures. 362 .

Approximately 5 ml of blood was collected by phlebotomy, the sample was 366 centrifuged at room temperature, and serum was then stored at -80\u00b0C. NP swab samples 367 collected with FLOQSwabs\u2122 swabs (COPAN) were placed into cryovials with Trizol 368 (Invitrogen), and stored at -80\u00b0C within ~5 min of collection. For subjects with acute diarrhea (\u2265 369 3 loose or watery stools in 24 hours), stool was collected into clean plastic containers and stored 370 at -80\u00b0C within ~5 min of collection. Samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until shipment on dry ice to 371 UCSF for sequencing. 372\n\nClinical data: 374\n\nClinical information was obtained from interviews with parents or guardians, with 375 specific data entered onto a standardized case record form that included admission diagnosis and 376 physical examination as well as malaria blood smear results. For malaria diagnosis, thick blood 377 smears were Giemsa stained and evaluated by Tororo District Hospital laboratory personnel 378 following routine standard-of-care practices. No efforts were made to improve on routine 379 practice, so malaria smear readings represent routine standard-of-care rather than optimal quality 380 controlled reads.
