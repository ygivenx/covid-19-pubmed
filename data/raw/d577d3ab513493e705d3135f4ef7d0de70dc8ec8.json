{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Severity of Coronavirus Respiratory Tract Infections in Adults Admitted to Acute Care in Toronto, Ontario Severity of Coronavirus Respiratory Tract Infections in Adults Admitted to Acute Care in Toronto, Ontario", "body": "Four types of endemic CoVs are in current circulation, OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63.\n\nRecent findings demonstrate a seasonality for CoV infections, with peak numbers being observed in the winter months 2 . However, this data is based on nationally-reported findings from the United States, and may not reflect local or national epidemiology in Canada. Moreover, the receptor-binding domain of the glycoprotein of 229E has undergone adaptation over the last 50 years 8 , suggesting that ongoing viral evolution may influence which strains predominate from\n\nyear to year. This is further supported by phylogenetic data examining OC43 isolates, which showed that the circulating genotypes in southeast Asia changed over time 9 . A recent study in the midwestern USA reported frequent identification of HKU1, whereas a separate study from China reported OC43 to be more prevalent 10, 11 . Therefore, determining the regional prevalence is important to understand the burden of these infections.\n\nIn acute care hospitals, much of the focus in diagnostics has been placed on influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) because of the severe infection and poor outcomes of hospitalized patients, yet the burden of CoV in acute care is not well studied. Most hospitals do not routinely test for CoV resulting in gaps in our clinical and epidemiologic understanding of this virus. The predictors of severe infection are well known for CoV associated with acute respiratory syndromes (eg. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV), yet few studies have identified these predictors for the more common four circulating CoV strains such as OC43, 229E, HKU1 and NL63 12, 13 . The primary objective of this study was to describe the burden of CoV among patients admitted to an acute care hospital in Toronto, Canada over a six-year period, and identify the predictors of severe disease.\n\nThis cross-sectional study was performed at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, a tertiary-care hospital with over 1300 total beds serving acutely ill and rehabilitating patients as well as longterm care residents. Institutional ethics approval was obtained (REB#066-2017).\n\nThe study participants included admitted patients \uf0b317 years of age who tested positive for a CoV for all patients meeting inclusion criteria. Cases were considered to be community-acquired if they were diagnosed within 72h of admission and nosocomial if they were diagnosed \u226572h after admission 14 . Lower respiratory tract involvement was defined as radiographic evidence of acute disease, determined on review of radiology reports.\n\nDependent (outcome) variables were those associated with severity and burden of disease. These included: number of symptoms, presence or absence of fever, need for oxygen therapy or intubation, chest radiography changes, isolation of bacteria by conventional culture, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), number of days spent in the ICU, antimicrobial and antiviral use, length of stay in hospital and death. Independent variables included coronavirus strain (OC43 vs. non-OC43), gender, smoking status (not a smoker, previously a smoker, current smoker), and age. The age variable was converted into a categorical variable with three categories including: less than 60 years of age, patients between 61 and 80 years of age, and patients over 80 years of age. The Chi-squared/Fisher's exact test, Kruskal Wallis, Mann-Whitney and unpaired T-tests were used to assess the presence of statistically significant correlations between dependent and independent variables. Statistically significant correlations were included in univariable logistic or non-parametric regression analyses to evaluate the predictive ability of the independent variable. A bivariate and a multivariate logistic regression analysis were also performed including the following variables: age, smoking status (current or previous smoker vs. nonsmoker), viral strain (OC43 vs. non-OC43), nosocomial vs. community acquired infection, gender, and number of comorbidities (3 or more vs. less than 3). Statistical analysis was performed using SAS University Edition (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).\n\nDuring the study period, 5,038 samples were positive for a respiratory virus of which 11.3% (n=569) were positive for CoV representing the third most frequently identified pathogen after influenza viruses and rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (Figure 1a) . It was noted that infections were identified year-round, but the peak number of cases occurred between November and February each year (data not shown). The number of CoV infections increased between 2010 and 2016 ( Figure 1c) . From these samples, 226 patients met study inclusion criteria. Amongst the CoVs, the most frequently identified strain was OC43, representing 50% (n= 285) of CoVs, followed by 229E (22.3%, n=127), HKU1 (13.9%, n=79) and NL63 (13.7%, n=78) (Figure 1b) . \n\nThe age of patients spanned from 18 to 99 years old and the median age was 77 (Table 1) .\n\nAdditionally, the distribution of cases was similar between males and females (44.7% vs. 55.3%).\n\nAs shown in table 1, comorbidities were common amongst our cohort, with vascular, cardiac and pulmonary comorbidities being the most frequently reported. Only 3.1% of patients were current smokers, and 12.8% were former smokers. All-cause mortality, n (%) 16 (7%) \n\nThe predictor variables associated with severe disease outcomes are presented in Table 3 .\n\nPatients with OC43 had 2-fold odds of requiring O2 or intubation compared to non-OC43 strains, while no difference in mortality or ICU admission was found based on CoV strain. \n\nThis cross-sectional study spanning 6-years suggests that CoV accounts for an important burden of respiratory infection, representing 1 out of 9 viral respiratory infections, with a propensity to cause lower-respiratory tract infection and severe outcomes. Notably, all-cause mortality and risk of ICU admission were similar to rates reported for influenza and RSV 15, 16 .\n\nOur findings indicate that CoV is not a benign infection among those who are hospitalized, and is similar to available data elsewhere. Garbino and colleagues found that 31% of patients in their cohort were admitted to the ICU, and noted an all-cause mortality of 10%. Lowerrespiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are the fourth leading cause of mortality globally, and characterizing the epidemiology of respiratory viruses is a necessary first step to reducing the burden of disease 7 .\n\nPredictors of severe outcome including need for ICU admission or mechanical ventilation have been described for MERS-CoV, but there is a paucity of data on other CoVs 12, 17 year. Importantly, our study did not include asymptomatic or subclinical cases or non-CoV controls, which makes it challenging to identify determinants of severity relative to these other populations. Moreover, as data emerges on the association of CoVs with central nervous system sequalae, future studies should investigate the incidence of strokes, and seizures in cases of CoV infection 30 . The number of patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should also be considered in subsequent studies. Since our assay was not quantitative we are unable to determine the role of viral load in influencing disease severity, although it has been noted by others that viral load did not correlate with outcome 31 . Furthermore, we did not include biomarkers associated with liver function. It has been reported that elevated ALT was associated with adverse outcomes in patients infected with SARS 32 , and further investigation is necessary to determine the prognostic value in other CoV infections. Finally, the relatively small numbers of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f cases of each strain (e.g. OC43, 229E, HKU1, NL63) prevented separate analysis of any potential effects of individual strains on patient outcome.\n\nOur study describes burden and risk factors associated with disease severity in patients infected with CoV at a single urban healthcare centre. At present there is likely an under-reporting of CoV infections in Canadian hospitals, as many laboratories do not routinely test for these pathogens.\n\nCollectively, this study highlights the significant burden of CoVs and justifies the need for surveillance in the acute care setting.
