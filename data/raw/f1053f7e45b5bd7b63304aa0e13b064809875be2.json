In addition, computational combinatorial methods for epitope mapping are also useful. These methods rely on the ability of the antibody of interest to affinity isolate specific short peptides from combinatorial phage display peptide libraries. The peptides are then regarded as leads for the definition of the epitope corresponding to the antibody used to screen the peptide library. For epitope mapping, computational algorithms have been developed, such as Mapitope, which has recently been found to be effective in mapping conformational discontinuous epitopes. The pros and cons of various approaches towards epitope mapping are also discussed.\n\nWithout a doubt, the greatest advancement in managing public nating with its corresponding epitope.

Ever since Jenner's individual with the epitope of that mAb should elicit the same classical demonstration of the protective benefit of vaccination (in potent neutralizing activity characteristic of the original mAb.

The success of vaccines has even gone beyond variants of the pathogen it neutralizes, those individuals immuits original objective (to empower individuals with immunity nized with the mAb epitope would also acquire the ability to against various pathogens), and today it appears that through broadly cross neutralize divergent pathogens. Thus, the crux of the persistent vaccination some diseases have been eradicated from problem for such a 'reversed immunological approach' is to be the face of the earth.

In contrast to this approach, an alternative computabeen produced and used extensively to characterize B-cell tional predictive algorithm has been developed in which the epitopes. [76] [77] [78] Generally, the procedure is straightforward. The panel of peptides is analyzed collectively. [76, 86] mAb to be analyzed is immobilized on a solid surface and reacted\n\nThe Mapitope Algorithm with a comprehensive library of random peptides (usually in the Mapitope is a novel computer algorithm for the prediction of order of 10 8 -10 10 different peptides that are typically 6-15 residiscontinuous B-cell epitopes based on the notion that the panel of dues long and may or may not be disulfide constrained); [79, 80] this peptides derived from a random peptide library collectively repreprocess has been coined 'biopanning'. The result is that those sents the epitope of the mAb that they bind. [76, 86] random peptides that resemble the mAb epitope in some manner are bound by the immobilized mAb and the others are washed\n\nThe underlying principle of Mapitope is that the simplest away. The affinity bound phages are then collected and their meaningful fragment of an epitope is an 'amino acid pair' (AAP) peptide sequences determined. When the sequence of the affinity of residues that lie within the footprint of the epitope. These AAPs The fth-1 phage, containing no insert, was used as a negative control, and signals were produced using enhanced chemiluminescence (from Bublil et al., [87] with permission).\n\ncan be related to one another on the surface of the antigen such that example, a peptide of the sequence ABCDE\u2026 would be written as a cluster of pairs is defined which constitutes the majority of the the series of pairs, AB BC CD DE, etc. All AAPs derived from a epitope footprint, i.e. the predicted epitope is in essence a cluster panel of peptides are then pooled and the frequency of each type is of connected AAPs. The AAPs of the epitope need not be consecu-calculated and determined whether its representation in the pool is tive tandem residues of the antigen, but often are the result of higher than its random expectation (based on the theoretical amino juxtaposition of distant residues brought together through folding acid frequencies of the phage library). The most significant AAPs of the polypeptide chain. AAPs of the epitope are simulated by are considered as statistically significant pairs (SSPs). Thus, each tandem residues of the peptides, affinity selected from a random peptide is assumed to contain one or more epitope-relevant AAPs, library.\n\nwhich are the basis for mAb recognition of that peptide.\n\nIn order to identify the most meaningful AAPs present in the Figure 1 demonstrates the fundamental concept of the alpanel of peptides, the peptides are deconvoluted into pairs. For gorithm; that is, the role of SSPs in mAb recognition. Note that the Fig. 2 . Space-filling representation of Mapitope predictions of (a) the monoclonal antibody 13b5 epitope on the surface of HIV-1 p24 antigen and (b) the trastuzumab epitope on the surface of the HER-2/neu receptor. [78] The number of amino acids comprising each antigen's surface, genuine and predicted epitopes are given. Also given is the number of correctly predicted residues (indicated in green), over-predicted residues (indicated in red) and residues that were missed (indicated in blue). The p-values express a hyper-geometric distribution (the probability of randomly predicting the epitope) and were calculated as described by Mayrose et al. [85] "}
