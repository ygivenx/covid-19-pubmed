{"title": "Equivalence of Self- and Staff-Collected Nasal Swabs for the Detection of Viral Respiratory Pathogens", "body": "The need for the timely collection of diagnostic biosamples (such as nasal swabs) during acute symptomatic episodes represents a major obstacle to large-scale studies on acute respiratory infection (ARI) epidemiology. This may be circumvented by having the participants collect their own nasal swabs (\u201cself-collected nasal swabs\u201d or \u201cself-swabbing\u201d). This method has been shown to be highly acceptable and feasible in various populations, e.g. among parents who collected nasal swabs from their children [1] or adults who collected swabs from themselves [2] (also reviewed in [3]). While the mere feasibility of nasal self-swabbing has thus been amply demonstrated, efforts to validate the diagnostic equivalence of self-swabbing compared to staff-swabbing are still ongoing. In a sample of 38 individuals with ARI symptoms, Larios et al. compared self-collected midturbinate swabs with staff-collected nasopharyngeal swabs (gold standard) that were collected the same day. The self-collected swabs had a sensitivity of 86% for the detection of respiratory pathogens compared to the gold standard [4]. Luinstra et al. found similar detection rates for respiratory pathogens between self- and staff-collected midturbinate swabs when one staff-collected and one self-collected swab were taken from opposite nostrils during the same visit to a campus health center [5]. Ip et al. investigated the validity of self-collected nasal (posterior nares) and pharyngeal swabs to detect influenza virus infection and came to the conclusion that self-swabs may be a good alternative [6]. While these results do provide substantial evidence for the validity of self-collected midturbinate swabs, anterior nasal swabs have not been evaluated in this respect. Moreover, self-collected nasal swabs collected on separate days have not been compared with each other.\n\nIn the present study, we thus compared quality of swabbing and efficiency of viral detection of anterior nasal swabs in the following scenarios: 1) self- vs. staff-collected swabs that were taken during the same visit to the study center (day 1), and 2) self- and staff-collected swabs from day 1vs. self-collected swabs that were obtained at home on a later day.\n\nA prospective study was conducted during the 2010/2011 ARI season among a convenience sample of employees of our institution, the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in Braunschweig, Germany. In December 2010, employees (18 to 69 years old) were sent messages through the internal e-mail system inviting them to participate in the study. This invitation contained a link to the institutional intranet where information about the study was made available in English and German. Individuals planning to leave Braunschweig during the study period and staff members of the Departments of Epidemiology and Infection Genetics were not eligible to participate, the latter due to concern over a potential conflict of interest.\n\nAt the baseline visit (December 2010\u2013January 2011), the study aims were explained to the participants and informed consent was obtained. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect basic sociodemographic data. At the end of the ARI season (April/May 2011) the study participants completed a short acceptance questionnaire. All participants received a remuneration of 5 \u20ac.\n\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the State Board of Physicians of the German Federal State of Lower Saxony.\n\nDuring January\u2013March 2011 weekly e-mail messages were sent to the participants reminding them to come to the study center within 7 days of onset of at least one of the following symptoms: sudden onset of stuffy or runny nose, cough, sore throat, headache, malaise, chills, or fever, defined as body temperature >38\u00b0C. In the study center, a trained staff member (A.G.) obtained a nasal swab (regular flocked swab, Copan, Brescia, Italy, product number 359C) from the participant\u2019s left nostril and instructed him/her how to perform a self-swab. The participants also received written and visual instructions for nasal self-swabbing. The participants then self-collected a swab from the right nostril. Briefly, the swab was to be inserted into the nostril to the point where the basal edge of the flocked tip had just entered the nostril, corresponding to a depth of insertion of approx. 1 cm. The swab was then rotated three times, being careful to swab all 360\u00b0 of the anterior nasal lining and to include the superior recess (\u201cLittle\u2019s area\u201d) and the latero-inferior recess. The swab was then placed into 1 ml universal viral transport medium (Copan). A swabbing kit containing written and visual self-swabbing instructions, two nasal swabs and two vials of 1 ml transport medium was then given to the participants with the request to self-collect two nasal swabs (one from each nostril) at home the next day, to place each swab in 1 ml transport medium and to return the swabs to the study center as soon as possible. The swabs were stored at \u221270\u00b0C until analysis. The timeline of the study is shown in Fig. 1.\n\nRNA was extracted from 200 \u00b5l aliquots of transport medium (UTM Kit, Copan, Brescia, Italy) with the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). cDNA was synthesized with the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and tested by multiplex PCR (Seeplex RV15 ACE Detection kit, Seegene Germany, Eschborn, Germany) for the presence of any of 15 human viral respiratory pathogens (adenovirus A/B/C/D/E, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus, bocavirus 1/2/3/4, human coronavirus 229E/NL63 and OC43, parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3 and 4, influenza virus A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, and rhinovirus A/B/C), following the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations except that 4 \u00b5l instead of 1 \u00b5l cDNA was used as input for the PCR reaction.\n\nSatisfaction and acceptability were assessed using a nine-item questionnaire. Participants rated each item on a five-point Likert scale with 1 indicating strong disagreement, 2 disagreement, 3 neither disagreement nor agreement, 4 agreement, and 5 strong agreement. Some of these items were reverse-phrased to reduce response bias.\n\nData were described by percentage for categorical variables and median with interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables. Agreement between self- and staff-collected nasal swabs in the detection of respiratory pathogens was examined with Cohen\u2019s kappa (\u03ba) statistic using the following classification: <0 = poor; 0\u20130.2 = slight; 0.21\u20130.4 = fair; 0.41\u20130.6 = moderate; 0.61\u20130.8 = substantial; and 0.81\u20131 = nearly perfect agreement [9]. The McNemar test was used to compare proportions of positive swabs between paired samples. Log transformation did not lead to normal distribution of the \u03b2-actin DNA concentration values. Thus, the non-transformed values were used and differences between staff- and self-collected swabs were examined with the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test. \u03b2-actin DNA concentration values were also divided into quartiles and examined for association with positivity status using a test for trend. The statistical program SPSS for Windows, version 19, was used for all analyses.\n\nOverall, both staff- and self-collected nasal swabs were highly accepted (Table 1). Most participants reported that instructions how to collect the swab were easy to understand and that the nasal self-swab was easy to perform. The participants did not make a preference regarding self- or staff-collected swabs (Table 1).\n\nFifty-six of 84 (67%) participants reported at least one ARI episode, 18 (32%) participants reported two episodes, and one participant reported three, resulting in a total of 75 ARI episodes for the final analysis. The number of ARI symptoms reported in a single ARI episode ranged from one to seven (median, 3.0). Thus, 75 matched pairs of staff- and self-collected nasal swabs, performed on the same day, were available. About 14% of these were taken on the day of symptom onset (day 1), 33% on day 2, 22% on day 3, 12% on day 4, and 19% on or after day 5. The additional set of self-collected swabs, which was to be collected at home the next day, was obtained in the majority of ARI episodes (71/75, 95%), for 67/71 (94%) of which swabs from both nostrils were returned, and from only one side in the remaining four. Sixty-two percent of these swabs were indeed collected the next day (day 2) and the latest one on day 6 (Fig. 1).\n\nWhen comparing the staff- and self-swabs collected on day 1, \u03b2-actin DNA concentration was higher in the self-collected swabs (p = 0.008) (Fig. 2A). The \u03b2-actin DNA concentration was higher in the self-swabs collected on or after day 2 than in the self-swabs from day 1 (p<0.0001). Interquartile distance was smallest in the staff-collected swabs and greatest in the swabs that were self-collected at home, indicating lower variability in the staff-collected than in the self-collected swabs. \u03b2-actin DNA levels did not correlate with the duration of symptoms preceding the day of swab collection (Fig. 2B).\n\nA respiratory viral pathogen was detected in 31% (23/75) of staff- and in 35% (26/75) of self-collected swabs collected on day 1 (p = 0.36, McNemar test). In both, the most frequently identified pathogens were human rhinoviruses A, B or C (12/27 positive swabs, 44%), human coronavirus OC43 (4/27 swabs, 15%) and parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3 or 4 (4/27, 15%). Table 2 contains the complete list of detected pathogens, expressed as percentages of all 75 swab pairs collected on day 1 in which a pathogen was detected in at least one of the two swabs. There was nearly perfect agreement between the staff- and self-swabs collected on day 1 in terms of pathogen detection (percent agreement = 93%, \u03ba = 0.85, Fig. 3). The overall sensitivity of self-collected swabs to detect a respiratory pathogen was 96%, compared to the staff-collected swabs (Table 3). This very good agreement between the staff- and self-collected swabs from day 1 is also evident in the flow diagram shown in Fig. 3.\n\nAnalyzing the results obtained with the self-swabs from day 2 or later, a viral pathogen was detected in 39% (26/67) of the swab pairs when the results of both nostrils were combined. When the swabs from each side were considered separately, a pathogen was detected in 31% (21/67) of the self-collected swab from the right and in 37% (25/67) of swabs from the left nostril. However, this apparent difference was not significant (p = 0.22, McNemar test). Comparing viral detection of these self-swabs with that of the staff-collected swabs from day 1 revealed substantial agreement (percent agreement = 85%, \u03ba = 0.67). The detection of a viral pathogen was independent of the amount of \u03b2-actin DNA in both staff- and self-swabs collected on day 1 (Fig. 4). Likewise, there was no association between viral positivity status and \u03b2-actin DNA levels across all samples (p for trend = 0.943).\n\nIt should be kept in mind that only two individuals with PCR-proven influenza virus infection were detected. Therefore, anterior nasal self-swabbing for the detection of influenza virus infection still needs to be validated in dedicated studies. Recently, a flocked mid-turbinate swab was developed and turned out to be superior to the gold standard nasopharyngeal swab in terms of ARI virus detection [8]. The anterior nasal swab used in the present study has not been compared to this midturbinate swab. This should be done in a future study. Our findings are also limited by the fact that the study was conducted in a selected study population recruited within a research institution. However, the population included a mixture of scientific, clerical and support staff. Notably, education level spanned a broad range and did not influence viral detection or \u03b2-actin DNA levels. Nonetheless, our findings need to be validated in future studies using random samples drawn from the general population.\n\nDue to much lower expenses for personnel and travel, self-collection would be a highly cost-efficient way to obtain diagnostic nasal swabs in medium and large scale population-based studies on ARI epidemiology [3]. The presented study adds significantly to the growing body of evidence demonstrating its diagnostic equivalence to staff-collection.\n\nNasal self-swabbing proved to be an acceptable, feasible and valid method to identify viral respiratory pathogens in this selected adult population. Its applicability in the general population should be tested in future studies."}
