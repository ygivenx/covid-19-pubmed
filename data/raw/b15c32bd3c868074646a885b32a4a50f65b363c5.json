The 3D crystal structures of rRNAs and tRNAs have led to detailed mechanisms of protein synthesis in the ribosome machinery ( Zarrinkar and Williamson 1994) . Theoretical and experimental analyses point to a close correlation between the efficacy of microRNA in gene regulation and the 3D structure and folding stability (Long et al. 2007 ; Kertesz et al. 2007 ) of the microRNA/target complex. RNA functions highlight the biological significance of RNA folding and the need for a predictive model for RNA folding.\n\nExisting RNA folding theories mainly focus on secondary structures (Lu et al. 2006 ; Mathews et al. 2006; McCaskill 1990 ; SantaLucia and Turner 1997; Zuker 2003) . However, RNA functions often involve structures and structural changes at the tertiary structural level.\n\nhomology, see references provided in these citations: (Mathews and Turner 2002; Hofacker et al. 2002 ).\n\nRNA secondary structures contain no cross-links (non-nested interactions) in the corresponding graphs and thus permit use of efficient dynamic programming algorithms for conformational enumeration. Structural prediction algorithms based on free energy minimization (Mathews et al. 1999; Nussinov and Jacobson 1980; Williams and Tinoco 1986; Zuker 1989) can predict secondary structures, starting from a single sequence, with about 70% accuracy. Another type of approach to structural prediction is based on calculating the statistical mechanical partition function, which is an average over the conformational ensemble (Hofacker 2003; McCaskill 1990 ). The strategy is to determine the stable structures from the Boltzmann ensemble-averaged base pairing probabilities over all the possible base pairs. In 2003, Ding et al. developed a statistical sampling algorithm (Sfold) (Ding and Lawrence 2003) to predict RNA secondary structure. In the algorithm, 1000 structures are sampled based on the Boltzmann distribution. The cluster centroids of the 1000 structures give the predicted structures. The statistical sampling algorithm is found to give a better prediction than the free energy minimization method (Ding 2006 ).\n\nWhile the above methods employ the same empirical thermodynamic parameters (the Turner rules) for secondary structural elements based on the nearest neighbour base pair interaction model, other models use knowledge-based scoring functions. For instance, the CONTRfold (Do et al. 2006 ) model uses the energy parameters derived from a training set and the MC-Fold (Parisien and Major 2008) model uses a scoring function that represents the probability of selecting a certain nucleotide cyclic motif (NCM) for the given sequence. The NCMs in the MC-Fold include the lone-pair loops and the double-stranded internal/bulge loops, which are extracted from known PDB structures. Benchmark tests show that CONTRfold and MC-Fold programs give better predictions than Mfold (Do et al. 2006, Parisien and Major 2008) .\n\nFrom statistical mechanics, \u0394S loops = \u2212k B ln \u03a9 Coil /\u03a9, where \u03a9 is the number of the 3D conformations of the loops and \u03a9 Coil is the number of the corresponding coil conformations. The evaluation of the conformational entropy \u0394S loops is intrinsically a problem embedded in 3D space. The difficulty in the evaluation of the pseudoknot loop entropy comes from the conformational correlation between the loop and the helix. Specifically, the viability of a loop conformation is subject to the presence of the nearby helix due to the loop-helix excluded volume interaction and the end-to-end distance constraint of the loop set by the length of the helix. The presence of the nearby helix reduces the accessible space of the loop configuration, and thus decreases the number of the viable loop conformations.\n\nThe most frequently occurring pseudoknots in natural RNAs are the canonical H-type pseudoknots having a very short (single nucleotide) or completely absent inter-helix loop, L 3 . For the canonical H-type pseudoknot, the helix stems S 1 and S 2 have a strong tendency to coaxially stack on each other to form a quasi-continuous helix. Applying polymer physics theory (Fisher 1966 where N min major (S 2 ) and N min minor (S 1 ) are the shortest allowed lengths for L 1 and L 2 , respectively. The ad hoc fitting of known pseudoknots with the requirement that the pseudoknot be more stable than its hairpin components yielded estimates for the entropy parameters (Gultyaev et al. 1999 ).\n\nIn a canonical H-type pseudoknot, loops L 1 and L 2 span the major (narrow and deep) and the minor (shallow and wide) grooves of helices S 2 and S 1 , respectively. Therefore, the two loops are highly asymmetric (Aalberts and Hodas 2005) . Considering the loop asymmetry, Aalberts and Hodas (Aalberts and Hodas 2005) used the Gaussian chain approximation to derive the end-to-end distance distribution (between D and D+d) for an N-nt loop:\n\nwhere d = 0.1 \u00c5 and a = 6.2 \u00c5. The total loop entropy is where D L 1 and D L 2 are the end-to-end distance for a L 1 -nt loop L 1 and L 2 -nt loop L 2 , respectively. The end-to-end distances for L 1 and L 2 are determined by stems S 2 and S 1 , respectively.\n\nBased on the Gaussian chain approximation, Isambert and Siggia derived the loop entropy, \u0394S, for a general three-loop (non-canonical) pseudoknot (Isambert and Siggia 2000,  Isambert 2009): where D = L 1 L 2 + L 1 L 3 + L 2 L 3 , A 1 = 3(L 1 + L 2 )/2abD, A 2 = 3(L 2 + L 3 )/2abD, A 3 = 3(L 3 /2abD and . In the calculation, a = 6 \u00c5, b = 1.5 nm, n p =11, \u03b1 = 0.0068, d = 4a, h = 5a and n 1,2 are the numbers of the base pairs in stems S 1 and S 2 , respectively.\n\nThe early computational methods for RNA pseudoknot prediction (Gultyaev et al. 1995) were based on the genetic algorithm (GA). These methods, such as the STAR (Gultyaev et al. 1995) and the MPGAfold (Shapiro and Wu 1997) models, predict the structures with the optimal kinetic accessibility instead of the ones with the lowest free energies. Other pseudoknot prediction methods based on stochastic simulations, such as the ILM (Ruan et al. 2004 ) and the Hotknots (Ren et al. 2005 ) models, can give low free energy structures. However, due to the nature of the stochastic conformational sampling, the predicted structure is not guaranteed to have the lowest free energy.\n\nIn 1999, Rivas and Eddy developed a dynamic programming method (pknotsRE) to predict pseudoknot structure (Rivas and Eddy 1999) . Unlike the genetic algorithm and the other heuristic algorithms, the pknotsRE program, which uses a highly simplified energy function, is guaranteed to find the lowest energy pseudoknot. Later, with a more advanced pseudoknot energy model, Dirks and Pierce developed a partition function method (NUPACK) to predict pseudoknot structures (Dirks and Pierce 2003) . In 2004, Reeder and Giegerich developed a new algorithm pknots-RG (Reeder and Giegerich 2004) , which yields improved prediction than the original pknotsRE algorithm.\n\nAll the above algorithms use simplified nonphysical entropy parameters for pseudoknot loops. In 2006, Cao and Chen developed a physics-based pseudoknot prediction model based on a low-resolution structural representation, which is described below (Vfold, Cao and Chen 2006b). Benchmark tests indicate that the Vfold-based approach gives much improved predictions for pseudoknots compared to other models (Cao and Chen 2009).\n\nFunctional RNAs often form complexes with RNA cofactors to perform catalytic and regulatory functions in a variety of RNA machineries, including ribozymes (Andronescu et al. 2005) , spliceosomes (Staley and Guthrie 1998) and miRNA-argonaut complexes (Bartel 2009 ). Early computational models for RNA/RNA complexes, such as Hyther (Peyret et al. 1999 ), OligoWalk (Mathews et al. 1999 ), RNAhybrid (Rehmsmeier et al. 2004 ) and DINAMelt (Dimitrov and Zuker 2004) , can give the structures and folding thermodynamics, such as the melting curves and binding affinities, for the simple, Watson-Crick paired RNA complexes. However, these models cannot treat the formation of intra-molecular base pairs in the binding process and thus cannot treat the interplay between the intra-and intermolecular base pairing, which are known to be critical for many RNA catalytic and regulatory reactions. \n\nThe partition function stands at the center of statistical mechanical modeling. The partition function, Q, of an RNA molecule is the Boltzmann sum over all the possible structures:\n\nwhere s denotes an enumeration over all possible 2D structures (polymer graphs; see Fig. 1 ), \u0394G s is the energy of s and k B = 1.99cal/K is the Boltzmann constant. The calculation of the partition function contains two key ingredients: sampling of all the possible conformations \u03a3 s and accurate evaluation of the free energy \u0394G s (= \u0394H \u2212 T\u0394S) of each 2D structure s. Here \u0394H and \u0394S are the enthalpy and entropy for the given 2D structure s.\n\nThe empirical enthalpy and entropy parameters for base stacks and loops (Turner rules) form the foundation for RNA folding free energy prediction at the secondary structural level. However, even for simple secondary structures, the answers to many biologically significant questions require information that goes beyond these parameters. For example, the stability of a hairpin or internal loop is an average over many loop conformations which may involve a variety of sequence-dependent intra-loop contacts. The intra-loop contacts dramatically reduce the loop entropy. To understand and predict the loop entropy and stability for a given sequence, we must dissect the loop entropy for different loop structures with different intraloop contacts. Empirical thermodynamic parameters such as Turner rules cannot give such entropies. What we need is a theory to calculate the entropy.\n\nFurthermore, most existing RNA folding prediction algorithms are unable to account for the effect of the cross-linked (i.e., tertiary) contacts. One of the challenges comes from the entropy evaluation for tertiary folds. The success of the energy and entropy parameters for the secondary structure models relies on the additive nearest-neighbor (NN) model. For the conformational entropies, the NN model assumes that the entropy for a secondary structure is equal to the sum of the entropies of the subunits (loops, base stacks). Therefore, a parameter database for the different types of subunits would suffice for the calculation of the total free energy. However, the additivity rule for secondary structures is doomed to fail for tertiary folds. This is because the tertiary contacts (cross-links) between the different secondary structural motifs (helices, loops) cause inter-dependence between the (distant) motifs. As a result, even if we knew the entropies and free energies of the individual structural subunits, we would still be unable to predict the entropy and the free energy of a tertiary structure. Therefore, a meaningful database for the tertiary energy parameters, such as a list of the entropy parameters for loops, must consider the influence of other subunits. This, in fact, makes the experimental determination of the parameters impossible. What we need rather is a first principles model. The recently developed model, called \"Vfold\", is such a model.\n\nWhile predictions of the structure and full free energy landscape may not be possible at the high resolution atomic scale level, what is well within reach is to parse the complexity into two parts: To use low-resolution models to account for the complete conformational ensemble by treating the atomic details implicitly, and then to construct atomistic 3D (native and alternative) structures from the low-resolution models. Given the huge conformational space available to an RNA molecule, such a multi-scale approach has several distinctive advantages:\n\n1. At the low-resolution level, many experimental questions are not concerned with the specific locations of the hydrogen or nitrogen atoms; instead, they are far more concerned with the global fold, backbone flexibility, and the potential for large structural rearrangements, as investigated by small angle X-ray or neutron scattering and other low-resolution techniques ( \n\nThe key issue in prediction of the tertiary structural folding concerns the entropy of the global fold, which is largely determined by low-resolution properties such as the excluded volume and the chain connectivity effects. The reduced complexity of the low-resolution model allows us to maintain the rigor in physical principles when accounting for these properties. As a result, use of a low-resolution model enables first principles calculations for chain entropy, free energy, and the full free energy landscape for any given sequence.\n\nThe low-resolution structure provides a useful scaffold for the final all-atom folding model through structural refinements.\n\nThe predicted structure will provide highly needed guidance for experiments. For example, in NMR structural determinations of RNA, a severe limitation is that sequential resonance assignments rely heavily on Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) data to establish connectivities (\"NOE walks\"), which often requires several months of data collection and analysis. The information on the nucleotide spatial proximity from the predicted (low-resolution) structure can provide useful constraints for enhancement in the efficiency and accuracy of resonance assignments.\n\nVfold , the P-O 5 -C 5 -C 4 and the C 4 -C 3 -O 3 -P dihedrals tend to be planar and rigid, because the torsional angles about the C 5 -O 5 and C 3 -O 3 bonds tend to remain in the relatively rigid trans (t) state,. Therefore, the original six-torsion nucleotide backbone can be reduced to two \"virtual bonds\" spanning P to C 4 and C 4 to the next P in the chain (Olson and Flory 1972; Olson 1975; Olson 1980) . Calculations on the nucleotide atomic structures show that each virtual bond has a length of 3.9 \u00c5. The third virtual bond (C 4 -N 1 for primidine or C 4 -N 9 for purine) represents the orientation of the base. In addition, a survey of known RNA structures suggests that the distance between the N 1 (in pyrimidines) or N 9 (in purines) and C 4 atoms stays close to 3.9 \u00c5 and the torsion angle between plane P i -C 4 -P i+1 and P i -C 4 -N 1 (N 9 ), close to the g \u22121 isomeric state. Thus, the C 4 -N 1 (N 9 ) virtual bond is quite rigid. The three-vector virtual bond model leads to the following Vfold model for RNA folding:\n\n1. The virtual bond structure for a helix is constructed from the atomic coordinates of an A-form RNA helix (Arnott and Hukins 1972). bond is a virtual bond (see Fig. 3b ).\n\nAt the helix-loop junction, we fit the virtual bonds onto the diamond lattice with the minimum RMSD.\n\nThe Vfold model is fundamentally different from any of the simplified models such as the simple square or cubic lattice models used in other folding theories. Vfold is a realistic atomistic structural model because the virtual bonds are the realistic, physical P-C 4 and the C 4 -P bonds in the structure, and the discretization (diamond lattice) of the virtual bond configurations for loop conformations is based on the principles of polymer physics as well as known RNA structures. So the Vfold model can directly predict experimentally measurable and biologically relevant structures and stabilities. The Vfold package is available for Windows and Unix users (to be released; URL: http://vfold.missouri.edu/chen-software02.html). For pseudo-knotted folds, the CPU time (t seconds) for the Vfold-based structural prediction grows with the sequence length (l nucleotides) as ln (t) \u2248 \u221224.3 + 7.7 ln (l) on a Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU 5150 @ 2.66GHz on Dell EM64T cluster system. The most time-consuming part of the computation is the enumeration of the different stems and loops (2D structures).\n\nThe predictive power of the Vfold model is shown by its ability to compute the entropy for complex folds such as a 3-loop pseudoknot (Fig. 2) . The computation involves three steps:\n\n1. All the possible helix orientations are generated through the enumeration of (virtual bond) conformations of the loop L 3 . \n\nIn RNA pseudoknots, the close spatial proximity between loops and stems facilitates formation of the tertiary contacts between loop and stem nucleotides. Specifically, a nucleotide in the loop surrounding the major or minor groove is prone to form base triple interactions with a base pair in the helix stem (see Figs According to the protonation properties, the eight base triples can be further classified into two types: the protonated [C + .G-C) and C + .(C-G)] and the unprotonated base triples. The classification is based on the fact that the protonated base triples are more stable than the unprotonated base pairs (Cornish et al. 2005 ) due to strong electrostatic interactions.\n\nComputational prediction of the non-canonical tertiary interactions is extremely difficult because of the lack of accurate energy parameters for tertiary interactions and the higher conformational complexity and the larger size of the conformational space Ulyanov et al. 2007; Yingling and Shapiro 2006 ). Yingling and Shapiro predicted the base triples in the human telomerase RNA (hTR) pseudoknot using molecular dynamics simulations (Yingling and Shapiro 2006) . Though the predicted structure is not exactly consistent with the NMR structure (Kim et al. 2008) , the simulation was able to provide useful insights into the interplay between bulge formation and the base triple interactions in telomerase RNAs. Molecular dynamics simulation often relies on the initial input of the 3D structure. In contrast, the Vfold model, which uses the nucleotide sequence as the only input information, does not require any additional structural information.\n\nThe Vfold-based prediction of loop-stem tertiary interactions involves the following steps:\n\n1. Through explicit enumeration of the virtual bond conformations, the Vfold model gives the loop entropy \u0394S loops as a function of loop length, helix length, and assignments of base triples (Figs. 5ab) . Based on the Vfold-predicted entropy parameter set, for a given structure that contains loop-stem tertiary contacts, the free energy \u0394G can be evaluated as where \u0394h (i) and \u0394s (i) are the enthalpy and entropy parameters for loop-stem contact i.\n\nTheory-experiment comparisons for different systems with loop-stem contacts allow us to extract \u0394h and \u0394s parameters. As the lowest order approximation, we assume two sets of (\u0394h, \u0394s) parameters for protonated and non-protonated base triples, respectively. Fitting the melting curves for different pseudoknots that The above Vfold approach has led to accurate predictions for the loop-stem tertiary contacts and thermodynamic stabilities for a series of experimentally determined pseudo-knotted structures (Fig. 5c ) (Cao et al. 2010 ).\n\nPredicting RNA 3D structure is not a solved problem ( 1. Adding all atoms to the virtual bond structure. For nucleotides in each predicted helix, atoms are added according to the A-form helix atomic structure. The 3D conformations of the loop are generated from a combined fragment-based and diamond lattice-based method: the coordinates of the red nuclotides are adopted from the PEMV-1 fragment (PDB ID: 1KPX) and the remaining two nucleotides (blue) are generated by self-avoiding random walks on the diamond lattice. The method can effectively reduce the numbers of loop conformations to a few lowenergy viable conformations. For nucleotides in the predicted loop conformations, atoms can be added using helix nucleotides as templates, by aligning the P, C 4 and N 1,9 atoms with those in of a nucleotide in a helix. This step results in an \"atomistic version\" of the Vfold structure.\n\nThe product of this initial refinement step is a pre-refined atomic structure. The prerefined structure may contain some atoms/groups that clash sterically with each other. Such steric clashes can be readily resolved by the subsequent molecular dynamics simulation in the next step.\n\nEnergy minimization of the whole atomistic structure using AMBER molecular dynamics simulations. With the above pre-refined structure as the initial state, molecular dynamics energy minimization with the AMBER molecular dynamics package ( As shown in Fig. 7 , the above strategy gives reliable predictions for the all-atom 3D structures for simple tertiary folds such as pseudoknots.\n\nA \u22121 programmed ribosomal frameshift occurs when the reading frame is shifted by one nucleotide. The change of the reading frame causes the production of multiple proteins. Ribosomal frameshifting is a mechanism used by many RNA viruses to regulate the relative number of copies of viral proteins (gag and pol). Maintaining a normal ratio of gag and gagpol proteins is critical for viral replication. Alteration in frameshifting efficiency could lead to an abnormal ratio of gag and gag-pol proteins, resulting in reduction or elimination of viral replication (Dinman et al. 1998 ).\n\nThe ribosomal frameshifting machinery consists of three coupled components (see Figs. 8a and b): (a) the slippery sites (nucleotides in blue color) with the sequence XXXYYYZ, where X can be any nucleotide, Y is A or U and Z is A, U or C, (b) a spacer (black thick line) that connects the 5\u2032 slippery sites and the 3\u2032 mRNA structure, and (c) the 3\u2032 mRNA structure which can fold into a pseudoknot structure (nucleotides in red color). According to the mechanical model for frameshifting (Hansen et The three components of the ribosomal frameshifting machinery are coupled through the spacer length m: the tension force in the spacer is a function of spacer length, which varies with the folding-unfolding of the downstream mRNA. The tension force in the spacer is also dependent on the end-to-end distance X of the spacer, which increases from 3.3 nm to 4.3 nm in the 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 movement of the tRNA. If the downstream mRNA structure is robust against the large tension force, the spacer would more likely be subject to a large tension to induce frameshifting before unfolding of the downstream mRNA structure occurs. Otherwise, unfolding of the downstream mRNA structure would cause the relaxation of the tension, reducing the likelihood of frameshifting.\n\nQuantitative prediction of ribosomal frameshifting requires modeling of the folding stability and the structure of the frameshifting machinery. The partition function for the 3-component frameshifting machinery is Q(m,X)=Q ds Q ss Q codon . Here Q ds , Q ss , and Q codon are the partition functions of the 3\u2032 downstream mRNA structure (\"structured\" region, excluding the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 tails), the (single-stranded) spacer of length m and end-to-end distance X, and the codon-anticodon base-pairing duplex (in the slippery region), respectively. While Q ss and Q codon can be evaluated using the extensible freely jointed chain model (EFJC) (Gerland et al. 2004; Hyeon and Thirumalai 2005; Liphardt et al. 2001; Smith et al. 1996; Strick et al. 2000) and the nearest neighbor model (Serra and Turner 1995) , respectively, the computation of Q ds requires a statistical mechanical model such as the Vfold model. The tension force predicted from the partition function is given by F(X)=d\u0394G(X)/dX = \u2212k B T d ln \u03a3 m Q(m, X)/dX. The Vfold modeling for the system leads to an analytical relationship between the frameshifting efficiency and the mean tension force; see Fig. 9 . It should be noted that recent single-molecule experimental data yields a highly similar relationship ). Furthermore, because the experimental measurement ) for human telomerase RNA and the Vfold-based theoretical predictions (Cao and Chen 2008) involve different frame-shifting systems, the fact that similar analytical relationships are derived from independent theoretical and experimental studies suggests that the quantitative results for the frame-shifting efficiency may be valid for a variety of systems.\n\nFor a long time, the bottleneck for RNA tertiary structural folding has been the inability to treat the free energy, especially the entropy, of structures with non-nested, long-range (tertiary) contacts between nucleotides distant in the 2D structure. Recent advances in the construction of low-resolution conformational models allow us to predict the entropy and the full free energy landscape for RNA tertiary global folds, as well as the 2D structures for the local and the global free energy minima. These 2D structures can further provide scaffolds for the construction of all-atom 3D models of the stable and metastable RNA folds through molecular dynamics calculations. Comparisons between theoretical predictions and experimental data for the 2D and 3D structures and the folding thermodynamics suggest that the statistical mechanical approach is reliable. One of the key factors that contribute to the predictive power of the statistical mechanical models is the rigorous conformational sampling/entropy. A 2D structure can be defined by a graph, which consists of vertices (representing nucleotide monomers), connected by curved links (representing base pairing), and straight lines (representing the backbone covalent bonds). Any two base pairs on the graph can be nested, (cross-)linked, or unrelated. RNA structures are described at the secondary and tertiary structural level. Shown in the figure are the 2D structures and the corresponding graphs for (a) a secondary structure containing three helices and (b) a pseudoknot (as a simple tertiary structure). In the pseudoknot structure, the nucleotides within a loop in the secondary structure pair with the nucleotides external to the loop. (a) Each nucleotide has two backbone virtual bonds P-C 4 -P (blue) and a sugar-base virtual bond (red) C 4 -N 1 for primidine or C 4 -N 9 for purine. (b) An RNA conformation can be generated through random walks of the virtual bonds in a diamond lattice. In the diamond crystal the four carbon atoms are located at the vertices and center of a tetrahedron. Four such tetrahedral connected at their vertices fit in a cube. Repetition of such cubes side by side generates a diamond lattice.
