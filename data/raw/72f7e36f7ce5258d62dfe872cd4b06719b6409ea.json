The H1N1 2009 morbidity and mortality were particularly severe in Brazil during the first pandemic wave. H1N1 2009 has been associated with a higher severity rate among some risk groups and young adults than seasonal influenza. 1 The frequency of viral coinfections with seasonal or pandemic Infuenza A and clinical correlation is not well known.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate coinfection of confirmed influenza A and other respiratory virus in samples collected from hospitalized patients during the first pandemic wave in a Brazilian Sentinel Hospital.\n\nWe [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiologic data were obtained from medical records. Nosocomial acquisition of the H1N1 2009 was defined as an onset of illness after more than 72 hours of hospital admission.\n\nDescriptive statistics consisted of the characterization of the studied individuals and the assessment of coinfection through calculation of the respective median value and range. Chi-squared test was used in univariate analysis comparing categorical variables, with a significance level of p < 0.05. Non-conditional logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent associations between coinfection and groups of individuals. All reported p-values are two-tailed. The dependent variable was coinfection with influenza A, and the independent variables were presence of symptomatology and groups of individuals. The results were presented as odds ratios (OR) with t h e r e s p e c t i v e 9 5 % c o n f i d e n c e i n t e r v a l ( C I ) a n d p-value. All data were entered into and analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 11.0 (SPSS Inc. -Chicago, IL, USA).\n\nOut of the 159 samples collected from hospitalized patients ( In this study, from August 19 to November 31, 2009, we analyzed viral coinfections cases among hospitalized patients with confirmed influenza A. We found that coinfection with other respiratory pathogens was common (21.9%). This high rate is in accordance with other studies, where dual and multiple infections varied from 5% to 20% of all viral lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). [10] [11] Coinfections were more common among children (majority \u2264 1 year of age) than adults, and were detected most often associated with IAV than H1N1 2009. Other studies also report high rates of multiple infections in young children, mostly in children aged less than 12 months, 12 and hospitalized children with acute respiratory tract infection. [13] [14] Among respiratory viruses tested in this study, AdV was the most commonly coinfecting virus with influenza A. Some studies reported high rates of coinfections with AdV. Tiveljung-Lindell et al. 15 observed dual infection with AdV in 16.2%, and Calvo et al. 16 found coinfection in 78.6% of AdV infections.\n\nWe did not observe distinct clinical characteristics of cases infected by H1N1 2009, IAV, neither there were differences between single and coinfected cases, although the number of coinfections was small. Our findings do not allow the conclusion of greater severity of coinfected cases. Papadopoulos et al. 17 reported that coinfections were associated with increased disease severity, but other studies do not support this observation. In the majority of studies, coinfections do not show clinical differences compared to single infection neither in hospitalized 18 nor in outpatient children. 10 Establishing the relevance of coinfections is difficult. Some interpretations include concomitant infections, sequential infections, or long term, post-infection viruses. 19 The development of quantitative PCR, as well as its correlation with the clinical characteristics, may become a useful tool to clarify the role of coinfections.\n\nThese data confirm that other respiratory viruses cocirculate with influenza and suggest the need for further analysis regarding the impact of coinfections on these patients' outcome."}
