{"title": "Yuichi OTA 4) , Yoshihito AKABANE 5)", "body": "Epizootic catarrhal enteritis (EcE), a new enteric disease of domestic ferrets (Mustelo putorius furo), was first described in the United States in the early 1990s [11] . A novel alphacoronavirus, ferret coronavirus (FRcoV), was detected as the causative agent of EcE in 2000 and designated as ferret enteric coronavirus (FREcV) [11, 12] . Ferrets with EcE show general clinical signs including lethargy, anorexia and vomiting, and characteristic signs with foul-smelling, green mucous-laden diarrhea [12] . FRcoV was also reported as the causative agent of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)-like disease in 2006, and the virus was designated as ferret systemic coronavirus (FRScV) [2] [3] [4] . Ferrets with FIP-like disease show characteristic clinical signs of large palpable intraabdominal masses like dry type of FIP [2] [3] [4] . FRcoVs were divided into two genotypes, I and II, based on differences in the spike (S) gene, and it was suggested that genotype I was associated with FIP-like disease and genotype II was with EcE [13] . However, we previously showed that there was no significant relationship between the genotypes of FRCoV and disease in Japan [9] . In addition, genotype I FRcoV was also detected from many asymptomatic ferrets in the Netherlands [6] . The relationship between genotypes of FRcoV and clinical symptoms remains unclear.\n\nAlthough FRcoV genes were detected in ferrets by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PcR), there is no method to detect antibodies to FRcoV. We attempted to isolate FRcoV using feline cell lines and our newly established ferret cell line (manuscript in preparation), but the virus has not yet been isolated. Because the nucleocapsid (N) is conserved between coronaviruses and used as an antigen to detect antibody [5, 8] , the N protein of FRcoV was one of the most likely antigen candidates to detect antibody to FRcoV. In this study, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using recombinant N proteins was established and applied to investigate the seroprevalence of FRcoV infection in Japan.\n\nSamples from domestic ferrets: From animal hospitals in Japan, 9 serum and 26 plasma samples were collected from domestic ferrets between Aug 1st, 2012 and Feb 4th, 2014 and used for ELISA and immunoblot analysis. We analyzed and reported the results for 79 of the feces samples in our previous study [9] . One fecal sample from a ferret in our animal facility was used to amplify the N gene of the FRcoV Yamaguchi-1 strain.\n\nAmplification of N genes: RNA of the Yamaguchi-1 strain was extracted from feces using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. N genes of the Yamaguchi-1 strain was amplified by RT-PCR using TaKaRa RNA LA PCR TM Kit (AMV) Ver. 1.1 (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan). RT was performed using random 9-mer oligonucleotide primers, and PcR was performed using primer pairs, NF2 (5\u2032-TTA CAT ATG GTA TAA GAA CTA AAC-3\u2032) and NR2 (5\u2032-CGA TGT AGG AAC CTT CAA AAT A-3\u2032). PCR products were electrophoresed on a 0.8% gel and extracted using a QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN).\n\nConstruction of expression plasmids: Yamaguchi-1 strain fragments were amplified using primer pairs, N1F (5\u2032-TGG GAT CCA TGG CTG GAA ACG GAC CAC-3\u2032) and N179R (5\u2032-GAC TCG AGT TAG TTA TTG GAT CTA TTG TTG GAC-3\u2032) for nt 1-537 encoding a.a. 1-179, and N180F (5\u2032-TGG GAT CCA TTA ACA GTA ACA GTG GTG ATA T-3\u2032) and N374R (5\u2032-GAC TCG AGT TAG TTT AGT TCA TCA ATA ATT TCA-3\u2032) for nt 538-1125 encoding a.a. 180-374. These forward and reverse primers contained BamHI and XhoI sites at the 5\u2032-end, respectively. Fragments were purified using a MinElute PCR purification Kit (QIAGEN) and digested with restriction enzymes, BamHI and XhoI. Two fragments of the Yamaguchi-1 strain were electrophoresed on a 0.8% gel and extracted using a QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN). Fragments were then cloned into BamHI and XhoI sites of the expression plasmid pGEX-6P-1 vector (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, U.S.A.) using a DNA Ligation Kit Ver. 2.1 (TaKaRa). Plasmids were transformed into Escherichia (E.) coli strain DH5\u03b1 (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan).\n\nExpression and purification of glutathione-S transferase (GST)-fusion proteins: Two N protein fragments, N1-179 and N180-374, were expressed as fusion proteins with GST, GST-N (1-179) and GST-N (180-374), respectively. E. coli containing recombinant or control plasmid was cultured in 2 \u00d7 yeast extract and tryptone (YT) medium (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract and 0.5% Nacl, pH 7.0) containing 50 \u00b5g ampicillin ml \u22121 . Expression of recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl \u03b2-d-1thiogalactopyranoside (Wako, Osaka, Japan) for 4 hr. The bacterial cells were suspended in sonication buffer (50 mM Tris-Hcl, pH 8.0, 50 mM Nacl, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM dithiothreitol) and lysed using a Multi-beads shocker (YASUI KIKAI, Osaka, Japan). After centrifugation, supernatants were mixed with Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 1% for 30 min and then centrifuged at 20,630 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0c for 30 min. The supernatants were collected, mixed with glutathione sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) and incubated at 4\u00b0c for 30 min. After centrifugation, beads were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and once with sonication buffer. The beads were mixed with 300 \u00b5l of 10 mM glutathione and incubated at 4\u00b0c for 1 hr. After incubation, supernatants were harvested as purified recombinant proteins and used for ELISA and immunoblot analysis. The purified proteins were confirmed to be single bands by coomassie-brilliant blue (cBB) staining after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis.\n\nSDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant proteins: Purified recombinant proteins were mixed in equal volumes of 2 \u00d7 sample buffer (125 mM Tris-Hcl, pH 6.8, 40% glycerol, 4% SDS, 0.002% bromophenol blue and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 3 min. Samples were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and stained with cBB.\n\nQuantification of recombinant proteins: concentration of purified proteins was measured using Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent concentrate (BIO-RAD, Hercules, cA, U.S.A.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A standard curve was constructed using bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.). The absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer (BIO-RAD) at 595 nm.\n\nELISA: The concentration of purified recombinant proteins was adjusted to 5 \u00b5g ml \u22121 with adsorption buffer (0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6). GST was used as a control at 5\u00b5g ml \u22121 . One hundred microliters of purified recombinant proteins and GST were added to 96well microplates (Maxisorp; Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). After incubation at 37\u00b0c for 2 hr, plates were placed at 4\u00b0c overnight. The wells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and then incubated with 200 \u00b5l of 1% Block Ace (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Osaka, Japan) in PBS at 37\u00b0c for 30 min. After washing three times with PBS-T, 100 \u00b5l of diluted sera or plasma were added to duplicate wells and incubated at 37\u00b0c for 30 min. Sera or plasma was diluted to 1:100 or 1:500 with PBS-T containing 0.4% Block Ace. Subsequently, wells were washed three times with PBS-T before 100 \u00b5l of peroxidase-conjugated anti-ferret immunoglobulin (ROcKLAND, Limerick, PA, U.S.A.) diluted with PBS-T containing 0.4% Block Ace was added and incubated at 37\u00b0c for 30 min. Following three washes with PBS-T, 100 \u00b5l of Horseradish Peroxidase Substrate (BIO-RAD) was added to each well. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 100 \u00b5l of 2% oxalic acid to each well. The absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer (BIO-RAD) at 415 nm. All results were subtracted from the value for GST, and the cut-off value was arbitrarily set at 0.5. Phylogenetic analysis: A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the program MrBayes Ver. 3.2.2 [7] for MrModeltest analysis with a WAG substitution matrix [10] . We referred to the following sequences to construct the phylogenetic tree of N protein sequences; FREcV strain MSU-2 (GU338457), FREcV strain MSU-1 (DQ340562), FRScV strain MSU-1 (GU338456), mink coV strain WD1127 (HM245925), mink coV strain WD1133 (HM245926), ccoV type II strain fc1 (AB781790), FcoV type II strain M91-267 (AB781788), FcoV type I strain c3663 (AB535528), SARS-coV strain BJ182-12 (EU371564) and FRcoV strain Yamaguchi-1 (Lc029423). The tree was represented graphically using FigTree Ver. 1.4.2 [1] .\n\nStatistical analysis: Significant differences were statistically analyzed using chi-square and Fisher's exact probability tests. P values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.\n\nNucleotide sequence of the Yamaguchi-1 strain N gene (1,125 bp) was determined, and the deduced amino acid sequence of N protein (374 amino acids) was phylogenetically analyzed (Fig. 1) . Two recombinant N proteins, GST-N (1-179) and GST-N (180-374), based on the Yamaguchi-1 strain were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli and used as ELISA antigens with 7 sera and 15 plasma samples from ferrets. Although most samples reacted to both recombinant proteins, the plasma of ferret No.10 and serum of ferret No.22 only reacted to GST-N (1-179) and did not recognize GST-N (180-374) (Fig.  2) . These results indicated that GST-N (1-179) was suitable for detection of antibodies to FRcoVs. Therefore, we de- cided to use GST-N (1-179) in the subsequent investigation.\n\nIn addition, a cut-off value was arbitrarily set at OD=0.5.\n\nThe plasma of No.10 and serum of ferret No.22 showed differ-ent reactivities from the other samples in ELISA (Fig. 2) . To confirm the different antigenicity, immunoblot analysis was carried out using serum of ferret No.22. Plasma of ferret No.48 was used to compare with serum of ferret No.22. The purified proteins were confirmed to be single bands by cBB staining after SDS-PAGE analysis and used (Fig. 3A) . Plasma of ferret No.48 and serum of ferret No.22 reacted with recombinant protein GST-N (1-179), but only plasma of ferret No.48 also reacted with GST-N (180-374) ( Fig.  3B and 3c) . The results of the immunoblot analysis were consistent with those of the ELISA.\n\nSeroprevalence of FRCoV infection in ferrets in Japan: ELISA using GST-N (1-179) was carried out with 1:100 dilutions of nine sera and 26 plasma samples from domestic ferrets in 12 animal hospitals in five prefectures in Japan. The results showed that 31 of the 35 (89%) ferrets were seropositive for FRCoV infection. There was no significant difference between seropositivity and age or sex (Table 1) .\n\nIn this study, we attempted to clarify the seroprevalence of FRcoV in Japan and developed an ELISA using two Yamaguchi-1 strain recombinant N proteins, GST-N (1-179) and GST-N (180-374). More ferret serum samples recognized GST-N (1-179) than GST-N (180-374) (Fig. 2 ). In addition, identities of N (1-179) between Yamaguchi-1 and the other FRcoVs (96.6-98.3%) were higher than those of N (180-374) (90.7-93.8%) (data not shown). Therefore, we selected GST-N (1-179) as the ELISA antigen for our serosurvey. Surprisingly, we found that 89% (31/35) of domestic ferrets were seropositive to this antigen by ELISA (Table 1 ). There are reports of FRcoV gene detection in 56%-61% of ferrets in Japan and the Netherlands [6, 9] . These data indicate that FRcoV has already spread within the ferret population and that many ferrets may be persistently infected with FRcoV. However, there was no significant difference between seropositivity and symptoms, age or sex. Further studies are required to clarify the pathogenesis of FRcoV in ferrets. Plasma from ferret No.10 and serum from ferret No.22 showed different reactivities from those of other ferret samples in ELISA, reacting only with GST-N (1-179), but not with GST-N (180-374) (Fig. 2) . The different reactivity of ferret No. 22 serum was also confirmed by immunoblot analysis using GST-N (180-374) (Fig. 3c) . These results indicated that GST-N (1-179) is a better choice of antigen for ELISA than GST-N (180-374). ELISA using GST-N (1-179) will be useful for serological surveys for FRcoV. In future studies, this FRcoV infected with ferret No.22 should be analyzed closely.\n\nIn conclusion, a new ELISA system using the recombinant N protein of FRcoV, GST-N (1-179), was established. This ELISA will be useful for diagnosis and epidemiological studies on FRcoV infection in ferrets.\n\nAcKNOWLEDGMENTS.
