{"title": "", "body": "Y.S. Huang, M. Liu, C.H. Huang, and K.M. Liu are no common standards [4] . The Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) was therefore developed in the 1970s to improve the effectiveness of the assessment [5] .\n\nThe OSCE consists of a series of exam stations where observation is conducted with students' performance of specific clinical skills, such as taking a patient history, doing a physical exam, interpreting an image or laboratory result, or performing a clinical procedure [2, 6] . The patients (standardized patients, SPs) with whom the students interact are lay people specially trained to portray specific patient roles. The actorpatient in an exam station gives verbal and behavioral responses consistently to each student to provide him/her with the same clinical experience [7] . Faculty observers mark students' performance by using a case-specific checklist, which contains welldefined standards of the skills that students should demonstrate in that specific station [8] . As an OSCE can be used to assess a wide variety of clinical skills, it can provide the teachers with a reliable and general view of a student's competences [9, 10] .\n\nUsing an OSCE to assess clinical competences requires extensive resources such as personnel and facilities, funding, support from the faculty, the administrative authority, and students [9, 11] . Therefore, it is essential to carefully develop an OSCE program in order to implement it successfully in a medical school that has no such previous program. This study describes the experience of implementing an OSCE at the College of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University (KMU).\n\nKMU runs 7-year undergraduate-entry and 5-year graduate-entry medical entry programs. Apart from the premedical courses for undergraduate-entry students in the first 2 years, the curriculum is the same for all students. The curriculum consists of 2 years of basic and clinical medical science courses, 2 years of clinical clerkships, and 1 year of rotating internship. The pedagogic methods used at KMU include lectures, discussions, problem-based learning (PBL), lab sections, and clinical training. The assessment methods used are written examinations, oral examinations, and direct observation of their performance. On completing the curriculum, each medical graduate needs to pass the National License Examination before he or she is qualified to practice medicine [12] .\n\nThe Taiwan Medical Accreditation Council (TMAC), which is responsible for accrediting medical schools in Taiwan, stresses the importance of evaluating students' clinical skills, attitudes, communication skills, and professionalism with a consistent, effective and credible standard [13] . In its accreditation reports on Taiwanese medical schools, the TMAC expressed concern about over-reliance on written examinations to assess medical students. Written examinations generally place more emphasis on the students' knowledge base and thereby fail to assess students' attitude and clinical skills. Therefore, to conduct a holistic assessment of students' competences, a plan was devised to introduce the OSCE into the medical curriculum at KMU.\n\nUsing the OSCE to assess medical students' clinical competences was quite a new concept in Taiwan at the beginning of the 21 st century. Although the OSCE was widely adopted in medical education in many countries [14] [15] [16] , only two medical schools in Taiwan had introduced this assessment method into their medical programs at that time. Acknowledging the importance of assessing medical students' clinical competences objectively, the author (KML) proposed the establishment of a clinical skills center (CSC) and an OSCE program based on his experience at the University of Arkansas for Medical Science (Little Rock, AK, USA). The proposal received strong support from the President of KMU and the Dean of KMU Medical College (CHH), as well as a 2 years funding from the Ministry of Education (MOE), Taiwan. The President appointed the author (YSH) as the OSCE director.\n\nIn May 2002, Mark Swartz from the Morchand Center, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, USA, was invited to introduce \"the use of SPs in medical education\" for medical educators in Taiwan. His lectures had resulted in a surge of interest in this method and thus reassured our determination to adopt it at KMU.\n\nTo acquire more firsthand information about the planning of a CSC and the establishment and application of the OSCE and SP programs, the authors and some colleagues visited several leading CSCs at medical schools in the UK, the US, and Australia. They also paid special attention to the relationship between their OSCEs and integrated medical curricula. The differences between the OSCE designs at these schools were illustrated in a previous article [17] .\n\nApart from visiting CSCs, with the grant from the MOE, we invited medical educators from abroad to give lectures and workshops on how to implement the OSCE and SP programs. To invite experts to visit Taiwan, the author posted a call for help, and received responses from subscribers of DR-ED@LIST.MSU.EDU. Many CSC directors were willing to assist us in developing the program, among them was Gail Furman from the Saint Louis University (SLU) School of Medicine, USA. In addition to giving lectures, she shared the cases and checklists used at SLU, and trained seven medical students to demonstrate how to train SPs and the use of SP-student interview in teaching communication skills. The faculty at KMU then used these as a blueprint to develop cases of our own.\n\nIn 2003 and 2004, we held four conferences on clinical skills assessment and medical education. Medical educators from the US, the UK, and other countries in Asia were invited to share their experience in developing and using OSCEs and SPs at their schools. The faculty and students of KMU, along with the other medical schools in Taiwan, have greatly benefited from the lectures and workshops, which provided them with a holistic view of the OSCE and SP programs (Appendix 1).\n\nIn 2003, we set up an OSCE committee to develop cases and checklists, recruit and train SPs, and organize the OSCE. The committee decided to conduct a pilot OSCE with the 1 st year clerkship students, targeting their skills in history taking and communication. The OSCE would be a formative evaluation and would provide feedback for improvement; it would not be incorporated into the final grade. With students' clerkship experience in mind, clinicians in the committee wrote cases, and developed checklists based on the blueprint provided by Furman. The committee discussed and reviewed the draft cases, and adapted eight of them, which included cases of internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics/gynecology, pediatrics, neurology, and orthopedics.\n\nTo recruit SPs, advertisements were posted in the University hospital and online. Many medical students, patients, and staff members were interested in participating in the program. The OSCE director held an orientation meeting and explained the nature of being an SP. SP candidates were interviewed by one of the committee members, and those suitable for the roles were trained by case writers. Each case writer trained the SPs of his/her case on how to portray the patient's role, how to complete the evaluation checklist, and how to provide feedback according to the blueprint provided by Furman.\n\nThe OSCE consisted of eight stations, with two to three SPs and one faculty observer for each station. The SPs took turns to be the patient, and when not in the patient role, he/she would observe the interview. The committee decided to use a Group Objective Structured Clinical Examination (GOSCE) approach, which was similar to the Team Objective Structured Clinical Examination (TOSCE) [18] . Groups of students went through the eight exam stations, undertaking the role of the doctor in turns. One student in the group interacted with the SP directly to obtain a focused history for 12 minutes, and then the other students in the same group had 3 minutes to ask additional questions. Subsequently, the students would leave the station for 5 minutes, while SPs and the faculty observer completed the checklist, and then they would return to receive feedback from the SPs and the observer for another 5 minutes. The student-patient interviews were videotaped, and each faculty observer gave their comments on students' overall performance at the end of the examination.\n\nFirst year clerkship students who were to take part in the pilot OSCE had been asked to attend the lectures and demonstrations by guest speakers. Before the exam, the OSCE director also held an orientation for students to introduce the exam, and sample checklists were given to students in advance so that they could familiarize themselves with the requirements.\n\nDue to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in the spring of 2003, the OSCE committee decided not to use the clinic rooms in the University hospital. Instead, the lecture hall was used. Screens were set up to separate the eight stations; since the students' main task was history taking and not physical examination, no beds or other special equipment were required. Students were asked to wear their white coats and to bring their stethoscopes.\n\nThe 1 st OSCE was piloted on volunteers from the 1 st year clerkship students in April 2003. Groups of two or three students went through the procedures as stated above. The other 1 st year clerkship students who did not take the 1 st OSCE were asked to join the 2 nd OSCE in May 2003. On this occasion, five or six students were in one group. Due to the heavy load of their clinical responsibilities, most of the faculty observers were not able to complete the whole examination procedures: some were only able to participate on the first or the second day of the examination, so sometimes there were only faculty observers in half of the stations (Table 1) . As a result, the degree of satisfaction of the students with the 2 nd OSCE was lower than that of those with the 1 st OSCE (Table 2) .\n\nA questionnaire was conducted at the end of each administration of the OSCE, and the students were asked to evaluate seven aspects of the examination: exam content; exam environment; exam atmosphere; the performance of the SPs; feedback from the faculty; the improvement in their own clinical skills as they progressed through the exam; and their overall satisfaction with the exam. The response rates were 78% (14/18) and 95% (173/182), respectively. Most (80% or more) of the students indicated that they were satisfied or very satisfied with all aspects evaluated except the environment ( students indicated that the interference of sounds from the other stations in the lecture hall were a distraction. The problems of using a lecture hall as an exam space have therefore been resolved after the new CSC was established in Spring 2004. Some students gave written comments on the OSCE. Regarding the exam content, they suggested that physical examination and different types of case problems be added, such as patients with mental disorders, SARS, etc.\n\nMost students indicated that the SPs acted like real patients, though a few of the SPs could not memorize the script very well. A few SPs were too eager to give students hints, and would interrupt the students or give more information than were asked. The SPs' performance was later improved after more training by the case writers.\n\nFaculty members are often so busy that, during clerkship rounds, they do not have time to observe students' performance and give immediate feedback. Many students therefore appreciated the opportunity to practice their clinical skills, and to receive feedback about the strengths and weaknesses of their performance from faculty members directly.\n\nThe students also proposed some specific suggestions. For example, they suggested that the number of students in one group be decreased, so that every student can have the chance to practice more. Some students had originally thought that their tasks were to make a diagnosis, and were disappointed to find that they were merely asked to take patients' history and communicate with the patients. In addition to orientation meetings, they suggested that the committee post the information about the OSCE online, especially details of the OSCE process, schedule and requirements. The students also wished to watch videos explaining the OSCE in advance. A few students reported that the OSCE could be used at the end of each clerkship, which would be a more interesting and objective test than the current assessment methods.\n\nWe also distributed a questionnaire to SPs shortly after the end of the OSCE. The questionnaire included semi-structured questions about their reasons for joining the SP program, and their opinions on students' performance. The responses of SPs are summarized in Appendix 2. Both students and patients stated that being a SP was a worthwhile experience.\n\nAlthough two other medical schools in Taiwan had used the OSCE program as an assessment method about the same time when the KMU OSCE program was being developed, KMU was the first medical school that used a layperson to role-play a patient. One of the two medical schools used senior medical residents as SPs to evaluate its medical students' clinical competence [19] . The residents wrote the patient cases and played the patient's role. The advantages of using residents as SPs are that residents can give students instructions and constructive feedback from a professional point of view. Other reasons for using residents as SPs are that maintaining an SP program is resource demanding, and people in Taiwan are usually too reserved to participate in such an innovative program. However, the disadvantages of using residents as SPs probably outnumber the advantages. For instance, students are not likely to view their teachers as patients, and sometimes can even guess what the case problem might be judging from the resident's specialty. It is also a problem if there are personality conflicts between the students and residents when working together. This may produce a bias when the resident is grading the student.\n\nThe results of our questionnaire also indicated that the incentive of people who participate in this program is more for helping medical students rather than for the reward, as the hourly pay was lower than that of a part-time job at McDonald's. One of our SPs had more than eight surgeries in recent years, which made him an expert on being a patient, and he and his wife were eager to share their views on patients with the students. Senior clerkship students were willing to help the learning of the juniors even though they had heavy workloads, and they thought that being SPs were also a good learning experience for themselves. An advantage of using laypersons in our experience is that students generally would avoid using medical terms when communicating with patients. They would also use Taiwanese (a dialect in Taiwan) to communicate with those who could not speak or understand Mandarin.\n\nOur OSCE was the joint effort of the clinicians who devised the cases and trained the SPs, the faculty members who manned the stations, and above all, the SPs, who did a remarkable job. The students who participated in the first two OSCEs also provided [20, 21] . The OSCE and SP were suggested to be the most suitable method to assess half of the clinical skills listed [21] .\n\nTo provide a better environment to conduct OSCEs, the 6W floor of the University hospital, which used to be ward, was refurbished as the CSC in spring 2004. There are 12 examination rooms and one observation/ control room in the CSC. Students and faculty can use the examination rooms for various purposes, such as PBL sessions, teaching, practice, and evaluation of clinical skills, and the reviewing of videotapes or DVDs of students' OSCE performance.\n\nThe objective of medical education is to produce excellent medical professionals. To achieve this objective, KMU wishes to provide a well-rounded training program which emphasizes students' clinical skills, communication skills, altruism, and attitudes as much as their medical knowledge. To assess such clinical competences, KMU introduced and implemented the OSCE. It is important to organize and plan the OSCE carefully to ensure that the strength of this assessment method can be achieved [22] . In this study, we described the process of establishing an OSCE program at KMU that had no previous experience in the OSCE. As the OSCE is now widely used to assess clinical competences of students in medical education [23, 24] , as well as in other professional health education such as dentistry [9, 25] , nursing [26, 27] , pharmacy [28, 29] , physiotherapy [30] , and radiation therapy [31] , we are currently sharing our experience with the other colleges at KMU.
