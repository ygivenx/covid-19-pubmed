{"title": "ADAPTATION OF NOVEL H7N9 INFLUENZA A VIRUS TO HUMAN RECEPTORS Supplementary files", "body": ". Unrooted protein trees. Unrooted protein trees were constructed from full length H7 or N9 sequences using the Phylip Neighbor Joining algorithm from within the Ugene package (Dayhoff PAM distance matrix). Host species and year of isolation can be derived from the sequence names. H7N9 serotypes are labeled in red, other serotypes (H7Nx, HxN9) are in black. The proteins analyzed in this paper are derived from A/Anhui/1/2013 (blue) and A/Anas crecca/Spain/2008 (green).\n\nHemagglutination titers of the different pre-complexed soluble trimeric H7 proteins and mutants thereof were determined using either chicken, human or horse erythrocytes using 1 ug of HA as starting point as described previously 1 . Human and chicken erythrocytes contain both \u03b12-6 and \u03b12-3 sialic acids, although in different relative quantities (human cells contain more \u03b12-6 sialosides than chicken cells 2 . Horse erythrocytes contain hardly any \u03b12-6 sialic acids, while the majority of their \u03b12-3 sialosides are of the N-glycolyl type (NeuGc), which is not present on human or chicken cells, which only contain sialosides of the N-Acetyl type (NeuAc). Nevertheless, viruses that prefer binding to \u03b12-3 NeuAc are also able to agglutinate horse erythrocytes 3 . The mean values of at least two independent experiments performed in triplicate are shown. Standard deviations are indicated and asterisks (*) and crosses ( \u2020) indicate significant differences in HA titer between (mutant) proteins and H7/Teal (A, B and C) or H7/Human (D), respectively (P<0.001; One-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett's multiple comparison test). Limiting dilutions of pre-complexed soluble trimeric H7 proteins and mutants thereof were applied in the fetuin-binding assay as described in the legend of Figure 1 . The mean values of at least two independent experiments performed in triplicate are shown. The results shown correspond with the data shown in Figure 3 ."}
