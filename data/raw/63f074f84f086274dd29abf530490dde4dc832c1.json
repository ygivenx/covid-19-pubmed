{"title": "Modeling the Step of Endosomal Escape during Cell Infection by a Nonenveloped Virus", "body": "Most animal viruses share a common mechanism in the early steps of viral infection (1) (2) (3) . Initially, they dock on the cell surface, searching for some specific receptors, then they enter the cell through an endocytic pathway (4) and subsequently travel through the cytoplasm encased in an endosomal compartment (5) (6) (7) (8) . In many cases, endosomes containing viruses mature into late endosomes, which are later on transformed into lysosomes, where the viral particle is readily degraded (4) . Consequently, to pursue their target and deliver their genetic material to the cytoplasm, viruses have to escape the endosomal compartment before being degraded (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) . After leaving the endosome, viruses have to travel in the crowded and risky cytoplasm to reach the nucleus, where the sites of viral genes replication are located.\n\nViruses have developed molecular tools for efficient hijacking of host cell machinery. They use them for efficient delivery of their own genes and replication. Consequently, viruses can be used to explore cellular biology pathways such as endocytosis (4) , or to study gene and foreign molecule transfer (13) . To better understand the virus-host molecular communication, and to unravel viral efficiency in cell entry, interdisciplinary approaches have been recently developed (14) . In particular, to quantify early infection, including cell entry, endosomal escape, and diffusion into the cytoplasm, early models (15, 16) have used mass action laws, based on a single Poissonian rate to compute the time the virus spends in each step. Although the mass-action law can be used to obtain several quantitative estimates about the early time of infection, it presents several limitations. Indeed, these Poissonian decay rates are generally fitted to data, rather than being derived from biophysical molecular properties. In addition, as shown below, because the endosomal escape time depends on the concentration of proteases in the endosome, the escape rate is not time-independent; instead, it is an increasing function of time. Recently, using the virus-host interactions, new stochastic models have been developed at a molecular level to quantify the different viral entry stages, starting with the receptor binding at the cell surface, the virus internalization (17) (18) (19) , and the free cytoplasmic trafficking to a nuclear pore (20) (21) (22) (23) .\n\nDue to the central role of endosomal escape in the viral entry process and the difficulty of obtaining direct experimental data, our goal here is to develop and analyze a biophysical model to investigate and quantify the viral escape mechanism. The escape process is not clearly understood: whereas enveloped viruses possess membrane-associated glycoproteins mediating the fusion between the virus and endosome membranes, nonenveloped viruses (such as the adeno-associated virus (AAV)) possess penetration proteins able to initiate formation of small pores, leading to endosomal membrane disruption (24) . In many cases, endosomes containing viruses undergo a gradual and complex maturation, involving proton-pump-mediated acidification (25, 26) , and low-pH-mediated signals trigger conformational changes of both glycoproteins and penetration proteins. Interestingly, protons can either directly bind and trigger viral proteins activation, which is the case for influenza (27) or vesicular stomatitis virus (28) , or regulate the activity of proteases, such as furins (29) or cathepsins (30) , which then cleave viral endosomolytic proteins, leading to their conformational change and endosomal membrane destabilization, occurring for Ebola virus (31), Murine hepatitis virus (32) , papillomaviruses (33) , and parvoviruses (34, 35) . In particular, low-pH treatment of AAV particles appears to be insufficient to trigger the lipolytic activity of their viral protein 1 (VP1) penetration proteins, indicating that other unknown pH-dependent proteases cleave and activate VP1 proteins. Furthermore, the AAV seems to escape endosomes in an optimal pH window, before being degraded in lysosomes and after viral capsid has been primed by low-pH-activated cathepsins, which is required for nuclear uncoating (36) . In addition, due to possible degradation in the cytoplasm through the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery (5), the release location of the viral capsid influences the efficiency of arrival to the nucleus. For all these reasons, the pH and the escape time are two fundamental parameters defining the efficacy of viral delivery into the nucleus, and this calls for a quantitative modeling to determine the kinetics of the endosomal escape time. Interestingly, AAV contains only seven VP1 penetration proteins (37) , and the activation of a single VP1 protein defines the slowest timescale of the endosomal escape process.\n\nConsequently, to quantify the residence time of the AAV inside an endosome, we use the fact that the limiting step is due to the conformational change of at least one VP1 penetration protein. Thus, we develop a biophysical model based on the properties that a small number of endosomolytic proteins are involved, which is specific to AAV, and that the conformational change of these proteins is triggered by the binding of proteases. In this model, we first use a Markov jump process to describe the dynamics of proteases binding to a VP1 protein and compute the conformational change time. This analysis uses a Markov jump process continuous approximation (38) . Interestingly, we obtain the VP1 conformational change rate as a function of the forward and backward rates of proteases to the virus binding sites. We then obtain several quantitative results and predictions on the number of bound sites on VP1, required to trigger the conformational change. To integrate the dynamics of endosomal acidification, we further model the low-pH activation of proteases with a Poisson process, and finally obtain an expression for the mean first time a VP1 penetration protein changes conformation and disrupts the endosomal membrane. Finally, our model predicts that increasing the number of AAV in the endosome slightly decreases the viral residence time and its variance, whereas enlarging the endosome-size shall delay the escape process. We show that the number of AAV particles inside the endosome drastically modulates the probability of escape in a given range of activated proteases and we find that the optimal number of AAV is 3.\n\nModeling the conformational change of penetration proteins\n\nThe residence time of viruses inside an endosome depends on their ability to disrupt or fuse the endosomal membrane ( Fig. 1 ). For small nonenveloped viruses such as AAVs, endosomal escape is induced by the conformational change of penetration proteins in the viral capsid (Fig. 1) . To estimate the residence time t e inside an endosome, we start when there are already n v AAV particles inside a spherical endosome, with a radius r 0 \u00bc 0.45 mm (39) , and a volume V 0 \u00bc 4/3pr 3 0 \u00bc 0.38 mm 3 . In a first approximation, we neglect endosomal fusion or split (39) , leading to variations of the endosome size. Viral particles contain n P independent penetration proteins, formed of n s sites that can bind competitively activated proteases (Fig. 1) . Thus, there are a total of n v n p n s binding sites. In our model, escape occurs when the number of bound sites at a single VP1 penetration protein has reached a critical threshold n T , mediating its conformational change.\n\nThe goal of this section is to compute the mean time t(c) for a penetration protein to change conformation, as a function of the protease concentration c. The analytical formula for t(c) is used to fit experimental data. We consider that FIGURE 1 Endosomal journey of viruses. Viruses are endocytosed at the cell surface before trafficking inside an endosome toward the nucleus. The active transport of endosomes along microtubules (MTs) is accompanied by a change of the early endosome (EE) into a maturing endosome (ME) after a gradual acidification of the endosomal compartment. Low-pH-activated proteases bind to viral endosomolytic proteins, triggering their conformational change. Finally, the conformational change of a single viral protein induces endosomal membrane disruption, followed by the release of viral particles into the cytoplasm. After magnification, the region inside the dashed box shows that the activated proteases of concentration c can bind with a forward binding rate r(X,c) and unbind with a dissociation rate l(X) to viral endosomolytic proteins, where X is the number of occupied sites. When X reaches a critical threshold n T , the protein conformational change initiates the endosomal lysis.\n\nBiophysical Journal 102(5) 980-989 conformational changes associated with a single protein occur at exponential waiting times. Therefore the number X(t,c) of occupied sites at time t, for a given protease concentration c, is a Markovian jump process (38, (40) (41) (42) . During time t and t \u00fe Dt, the number of bound sites can either increase with a probability r(t,c)Dt when a protease arrives to a free site or decreases with probability l(X,c)Dt when a protease unbinds or remains unchanged with probability 1l(X,c)Dtr(X,c)Dt. Using the scaled variable\n\nWhen all binding sites are identical, and in the absence of any molecular cooperativity, the forward rate r(x,c) is proportional to the number of VP1 free binding sites and to the proteases concentration c in the endosome, leading to r\u00f0x; c\u00de \u00bc k 1 \u00f01 \u00c0 x\u00den s c;\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n s is the total number of binding sites for a single protein, and k 1 is the forward rate constant. The backward rate l(x,c) is proportional to the number of bound sites,\n\nwhere k \u00c01 is the backward rate constant. To extract the binding constants k 1 and k \u00c01 and the critical threshold n T , first we compute the mean time for VP1 conformational change, which corresponds to the mean waiting time to have n T bound sites among n s , and second we compare it with experimental data. When the protease concentration c is fixed, the probability\n\nis a solution of the backward master equation (38, (40) (41) (42) , p\u00f0y; tjx; c\u00de \u00bc p\u00f0y; t \u00c0 Dtjx \u00fe e; c\u00der\u00f0x; c\u00deDt \u00fe p\u00f0y; t \u00c0 Dtjx \u00c0 e; c\u00del\u00f0x; c\u00deDt \u00fe p\u00f0y; t \u00c0 Dtjx; c\u00de\u00f01 \u00c0 r\u00f0x; c\u00deDt \u00c0 l\u00f0x; c\u00deDt\u00de;\n\n(3)\n\nwhich has the Kramers-Moyal expansion \n\nThe random first time t that a penetration protein is filled up to a critical threshold x T \u00bc n T =n s is equal to the first-passage time for x(t,c) to reach the level x T . The mean first-passage time t(x,c) is defined as the conditional expectation\n\n, and satisfies (38, 43, 44) :\n\nFor \u03b5 << 1, using the WKB approximation (38, (40) (41) (42) and the generic binding rates from Eqs. 1 and 2, we obtain a closed expression for the mean activation time t(x,c) z t(c) (see the Supporting Material):\n\nwhere\n\nEquation 5 links the affinities between the proteases (concentration c) and the binding sites of a single VP1 penetration protein to its conformational change mean time t(c). The reciprocal of the time (Eq. 5) is the conformational change rate that has been experimentally measured for a few viruses, such as influenza (27), but the data are still missing for the AAV.\n\nTo illustrate our analysis, we compare the predictions of Eq. 5 to experimental activation rates. However, very little is known about the nature of the proteases and their relative affinities to the binding sites of the AAV VP1 penetration proteins. It would be helpful to obtain the experimental values for the VP1 dynamics, which could be possible by Biophysical Journal 102(5) 980-989 characterizing experimentally the proteases type and the corresponding conformational change kinetics for different proteases concentrations. Because these experimental data about conformational change are still not available for the AAV, we choose the ones from the influenza hemagglutinin (27)-another endosomolytic protein mediating endosomal membrane fusion at low pH. We determine the parameters k 1 , k \u00c01 , and x T from the analytical expression ((Eq. 5) for t(c). The experimental activation times t exp (c) obtained for different concentrations c (Eq. 27) are given by t exp \u00f010 \u00c04:9 mol:L \u00c01 \u00de \u00bc 1=5:78 s; t exp \u00f010 \u00c05:1 mol:L \u00c01 \u00de \u00bc 1=0:12 s; t exp \u00f010 \u00c05:2 mol:L \u00c01 \u00de \u00bc 1=0:067 s; t exp \u00f010 \u00c05:4 mol:L \u00c01 \u00de \u00bc 1=0:02 s; t exp \u00f010 \u00c05:6 mol:L \u00c01 \u00de \u00bc 1=0:017 s:\n\nWe first choose for the total number of binding sites n s \u00bc 9 (see Fig. 3 in Krumbiegel et al. (27) ) that we extract by fitting the protonated sites by a linear approximation in the pH range 4-7. Then we minimize the error distance\n\nwhere n is the number of data (n \u00bc 5 here) and c i are the different concentrations, using a standard gradient descent algorithm, and we find that k 1 z15\u00c210 3 L:mol \u00c01 s \u00c01 ; k \u00c01 z10 \u00c02 L:mol \u00c01 s \u00c01 ; and x T z0:66:\n\nWe conclude that the binding of x T n s z 0.66 \u00c2 9 \u00bc 6 sites is sufficient to trigger the activation of the penetration protein (the parameters are summarized in Table 1 ). Furthermore, we find that Eq. 5 accounts well for the entire experimental data set of the influenza hemagglutinin ( Fig. 2) , confirming the validity of our approach. Finally, this procedure is general and can be applied to analyze other viral protein conformational changes.\n\nModeling the arrival of proteases in the endosome\n\nTo estimate the residence time of the AAV inside the endosome, we now couple the exponential distribution of the VP1 conformational change time (see Eq. 5) analyzed above with the endosome acidification and subsequent activation of proteases. As protons are pumped into the endosome, they can bind proteases, such as furins and cathepsins, mostly through protonation of a single histidine residue (29, 30) , which can in turn cleave penetration proteins, triggering their conformational change. In the first approxi-mation, we assume that counting pumped protons is a Poisson process. Thus the proton entry dynamics x(t) is described by\n\n; w:p: lDt x\u00f0t\u00de; w:p: 1 \u00c0 lDt:\n\nFurthermore, protons mostly activate proteases P through a standard first-order chemical reaction (protonation of a single histidine residue (29,30)),\n\nWhen the number of protease is in excess and the binding dynamics converges to equilibrium much faster than the entry rate, we can approximate the binding dynamics by the Michaelis-Menten approximation (46) as Backward rate constant k \u00c01 z 10 \u00c02 L mol \u00c01 s \u00c01 n s \u00bc 1/e Number of binding sites n s \u00bc 9 \n\nwhere K is the equilibrium constant and P 0 the total number of proteases. In a linear regime, where the conformational change occurs for x(t) << K, the total number of bound protease y(t) is given by y\u00f0t\u00dez P 0 x\u00f0t\u00de K (11) and the number of protease activations in the endosome is approximated as Poissonian, with a ratel \u00bc \u00f0P 0 =K\u00de l. Consequently, the probability P q (t) of exactly q proteases in the endosome at time t is equal to\n\nLater on, we will estimate the proteases activation ratel from the experimental mean escape time obtained for the AAV: t e z 5 min. Indeed, the AAV reaches the nucleus in~15 min (6) and the trafficking stage after endosomal escape lasts 5 min, as inferred in Lagache et al. (21) . Consequently, the endosomal trafficking lasts~10 min, minus the 5 min needed for the initial coated vesicle containing the virus to reach an endosome (47) .\n\nWe now proceed with the computation of the concentration hc t e i of proteases associated with the mean t e and the variance var(t e ) of the viral escape time from the endosome. This analysis relies on the dynamics of protease entry (see Eq. 12) and on estimating for each concentration the probability for a single protein to change conformation that leads to viral escape. Because the AAV contains only seven penetration proteins (37), we consider that escape occurs when at least one of them is activated. In addition, because proteases are in excess, each VP1 is treated independently. Furthermore, because wild-type AAV rescue the infectivity of mutant devoid of penetration proteins (34, 48) , this experimental result confirms that all viruses escape when at least one of them penetrates the membrane. Consequently, to estimate the mean proteases concentration hc t e i at which viruses escape the endosome, we shall compute the probability P 0 e (c) that a penetration protein changes conformation before a new protease is activated for a fixed concentration c. The probability of no conformational changes is p\u00f0t; c\u00de \u00bc Z x T 0 p\u00f0y; tjx 0 \u00f0c\u00de; c\u00dedy; (13) where initially x(t \u00bc 0) \u00bc x 0 (c). Because a protease is activated during time t and t \u00fe dt with a ratele \u00c0lt dt, the probability of no conformational changes until a protease is activated is given by R N 0p \u00f0t; c\u00dele \u00c0lt dt. Thus,\n\n\u00f0t; c\u00dele \u00c0lt dt: (14) Approximatingp\u00f0t; c\u00de with the long time asymptotics p\u00f0t; c\u00deze \u00c0 t t\u00f0c\u00de ;\n\nEq. 14 reduces to\n\nWe note that for a proteases concentration c such that x 0 (c) -\n\n, a boundary layer analysis is required (see the Supporting Material). Because one protein conformational change is enough to induce viral escape, we estimate the probability P e (j) that at least one conformational change occurs after exactly j proteases have been activated. P e (j) is the product of the probabilities that no conformational changes occur between successive protease activation, until the j th one\n\nwhere c\u00f0i\u00de \u00bc i=\u00f0N A V 0 \u00de \u00fe c 0 is the concentration associated with the activation of i proteases in the endosome and c 0 is the initial concentration. Finally, the mean protease concentration at the escape time is\n\nwhich can be estimated as (see the Supporting Material)\n\nTo relate the protease activation ratel with the experimental mean escape time measured for the AAV, we now compute the mean escape time\n\nBased on the protease activation Poissonian rate (12), considering whether or not the conformational change time occurs between two consecutive protease activations, we derive in the Supporting Material the equation\n\nwhere l i \u00bc n v n P t\u00f0c\u00f0i\u00de\u00de (22) are the viral escape rates when there are exactly i proteases in the endosome. Similarly, the variance is\n\nand we estimate it in the Supporting Material as var\u00f0t e \u00de \u00bc 2\n\nUsing the generic set of parameters for the VP1 penetration protein dynamics summarized in Table 1 , we plot, in Fig. 3 a, the mean escape time t e (5 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi var\u00f0t e \u00de p ) againstl for n P \u00bc 7 penetration proteins, as measured for the AAV (37) . We find that t e is a decreasing function ofl, and for the experimental value t e z 5 min, we obtain and predict that the protease activation rate is lz1:2 s \u00c01 : (25) We conclude with our set of parameters that approximately one protease is activated in the endosome per second. Interestingly, we find that the variance is ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi var\u00f0t e \u00de p z1 min; (26) indicating that the escape process is reliable. Using the protease activation ratel \u00bc 1.2 s \u00c01 , we plot in Fig. 3 b the probability density function P e (17) as a function of the number of activated proteases in the endosome. We observe (Fig. 3 b) that viral escape can happen with few proteases and very early in the endosomal trafficking with a large variability. Furthermore, this figure reveals that all viruses contained in the endosome should have escaped, when at most 600 proteases have been activated.\n\nWe now evaluate the effect of changing various parameters such as the number of viruses and the endosomal size on the mean and variance (Eqs. 21 and 24). As discussed above, due to the excess of proteases, all viral particles inside the endosome are considered to be independent. Thus, the mean escape time accounts for the first time that a single virus has indeed changed conformation and disrupted the endosomal membrane. Consequently, the mean escape Table 1 .\n\nThe escape time distribution is plotted against the proteases number. (c) AAV mean escape time t e as a function of the endosome radius. We consider that the proteases activation rate is proportional to the endosomal surface: ) is a decreasing function of the initial number of viruses (Fig. 3 d) , and precisely when the number of viruses increases from 1 to 10, the mean escape time decays by 35% (Fig. 3 d) .\n\nWe now study the effect of the endosomal size on the mean escape time t e \u00f0l; l 0 ; l 1 ; ::\u00de (see Eq. 21). As we will see, it depends nonlinearly on the endosomal size through the protease activation ratel and the concentration of proteases c through the viral escape rates l i , i R 0 (see also Eq. 22) . Because the number of V-ATPase proton pumps and the associated proton entry rate is proportional to the endosomal surface, the protease activation rate increases quadratically with the endosomal radius r as\n\nFurthermore, viral escape rates l i \u00bc n v n P =t\u00f0c\u00f0i\u00de\u00de decrease with the endosomal volume and the proteases dilution. To evaluate whether the quadratic dependence of the activation rate can counterbalance the proteases dilution, we study the function t e l \u00f0r\u00de \u00bc r r 0 2l ; l i \u00f0r\u00de \u00bc n v n P t\u00f0c\u00f0i\u00de\u00de that depends on the endosome radius r (Fig. 3 c) . We find that the escape time is overall an increasing function of r. As we will see in the Discussion, because the endosomal size can vary during maturation, changing the endosomal size can affect viral escape.\n\nTo quantify the residence time of the viral particle AAV in an endosome, we have modeled several steps, such as the change of conformation of the small number of VP1 penetration proteins and the maturation of the endosome through low pH activation of proteases. We have obtained an analytical formula for the mean first time that the number of proteases bound to a VP1 protein reaches a critical threshold, which in our model triggers its conformational change and endosomal membrane disruption. However, this value for the conformational change time is not yet accessible experimentally but our stochastic model links it with several biophysical parameters such as the proton entry rate, the geometrical characteristics of the endosome, and the binding rates to proteases.\n\nDuring endosomal maturation, the endosomal size can vary due to splitting and homotypic fusion of endosomes (39) and we predicted above (Fig. 3 c) that the mean escape time t e \u00f0r\u00de is multiplied by two when the endosome radius increases from 200 nm (t e z 150 s) at the beginning of the endosomal journey to 450 nm (t e z 300 s), which represents the radius of mature endosomes (39) .\n\nIn parallel to that size increase, endosomal maturation is also associated with a microtubule-directed transport toward the nucleus (39) and small early endosomes are preferentially located in cell periphery, whereas large late ones can be found in the nuclear periphery. Consequently, our model predicts that viruses should preferentially escape in peripheral endosomes, where the size is minimal, as observed in Xiao et al. (49) .\n\nOur modeling and analysis provide a general tool to explore the multidimensional parameter space of the endosomal escape. It allows us to quantify the mean escape time from an endosome and its dependency with respect to several fundamental parameters such as the endosomal size or the protease activation rate. In our model, the conformational change of a single VP1 penetration protein defines the limiting stage of the AAV egress from the endosome. We have indeed neglected other factors not directly correlated with the endosomal pH, such as the physical disruption of the endosome. These limiting factors shall be further investigated, but their kinetics should be negligible compared to the timescale of proteases activation and binding up to a critical threshold. In addition, almost nothing is known about the nature and activity of the proteases. Here we have considered the simplest situation where pH-activated proteases bind and cleave VP1. Yet, proteases may act at other sites on the viral capsid and trigger VP1 activation indirectly. Refinements of our model now await further characterization of the mode of action of the proteases.\n\nThe cumulative binding of protons or proteases to viral endosomolytic proteins up to a threshold, resulting in their conformational change, is a common feature of widely disparate viruses (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) . Because our model is generic, it can be applied to other small nonenveloped viruses, containing a few penetration proteins such as papillomavirus, with 10 L2 penetration proteins copies (50) . In addition, our analysis may also describe the endosomal stage of nonviral pathogens such as the anthrax toxin, where the cumulative binding of protons to the toxin protective antigen protein triggers its conformational change, leading to pore formation in the endosome, and delivery in the cytoplasm (51) . Other viruses such as reoviruses contain a large number of endosomolytic proteins that cooperate to disrupt the endosome (24) . In those cases, a different model shall be developed to study the cooperative recruitment of activated proteins. Interestingly, activation of reovirus penetration proteins involves a multistep conformational change process, where low-pH-activated cathepsins have to remove first the intermediate s 3 protein leading to the exposure of the penetration protein m 1 to other endosomal proteases Biophysical Journal 102(5) 980-989 (52, 53) . In that case, the general conformational change kinetics can be obtained by adding the mean times required for each conformational change of sand m-proteins to occur.\n\nViruses have to escape the endosomal compartment before being routed to lysosomes, where they are degraded. However, because priming of the viral capsid by low-pHactivated cathepsins is required for later stages of the entry process, such as genome uncoating and delivery into the nucleus (36), a viral particle should stay long enough inside the endosome. Consequently, we predict that there must be an optimal range in the number of activated proteases inside the endosome [k min ; k max ] in which viruses must escape. Whereas escaping above k max leads to an irreversible degradation, escaping below k min results in the premature release and the insufficient priming of the viral capsid by the cathepsins (Fig. 4 a) . Efficacy of the viral escape can be quantified by using the conditional probability P optimal to escape inside the range [k min ; k max ],\n\nwhere P e (j) is the probability that a virus escapes when there are exactly j activated proteases inside the endosome (see Eq. 17). P e (j) is a bell-shape function of j and depends nonlinearly on the number of viral particles n v (Fig. 4 a) , thus the probability that a virus escapes when the number of proteases falls into an optimal window is nontrivial, as given by Eq. 28. Using the parameters of Table 1 , with a protease activation rate l \u00bc 1.2 s \u00c01 , we predict that the optimal number of viral particles inside an endosome should be equal to 3 (Fig. 4 b) . The optimal probability for viruses to escape in the range of 250-350 is then maximal, equal to P optimal \u00bc 0.57. In addition, P optimal depends strongly on various parameters, such as the endosomal proteases range. Indeed, when the range is shifted to [300-400], the optimal probability is maximal for a single virus (P optimal \u00bc 0.21), and further drops to P optimal \u00bc 0.05 for two viruses and P optimal \u00bc 0.01 for three viruses. Finally, priming of viral capsids illustrates how virus trafficking includes a series of critical stages whose efficiency impacts on the outcome of subsequent stages (Fig. 5) . Future models should account for this complex virus-host communication.\n\nWe have studied here the effect of four main parameters on the endosomal escape of AAV particles: 1), proteases activation ratel, 2), size of the endosome, 3), number of viral particles per endosome, and 4), protease activity range for optimal escape. Each of these parameters could be optimized, either for enhancing viral vector mediated gene delivery or in strategies to interfere with viral infection. Our results indicate that controlling the number of AAV particles per endosome is likely to be the most effective way to act on viral entry. Although large aggregates of viral particles are inhibitory to infection, viral concentration and formulation buffer might be optimized to obtain small clusters with enhanced capacity for crossing the endosomal barrier (54) . For example, 2-5 viral particles per endosome, according to Fig. 4 b, results in an optimal delivery.\n\nDiminishing the protease activation ratel with protease inhibitors should have consequences on the endosomal Optimal escape from an endosome. (a) Influence of the viral particle number on the escape rate distribution. The number of viruses inside an endosome modulates the probability P optimal that they escape in a given range of endosomal proteases (between shaded regions, number of proteases between 250 and 350). Parameters are summarized in Table 1 , withl \u00bc 1.2 s \u00c01 and n P \u00bc 7. Plots are given for one and five viruses. (b) Optimal probability P optimal of escape in the proteases range [250-350], as a function of the number of viruses inside the endosome. The probability is maximum (57%) for three AAV particles.\n\nBiophysical Journal 102(5) 980-989 escape time (Fig. 3 a) . When dividingl by 2, the optimal escape probability P optimal drops from 0.53 to 0.32 when five viruses are in the endosome. However, when there is only one virus in the endosome, P optimal will increase from 0.37 to 0.52. Yet another approach to increase the endosomal escape efficacy would be to modulate the number of VP1 proteins per capsid. AAVs with altered capsid protein stoichiometry have been recently developed (55, 56) and it might be possible to engineer viral capsids with a higher density of VP1 activation domains on their surface. We predict that by replacing all VP2 proteins by VP1, the optimal escape probability P optimal , for a single virus, will increase from 0.37 to 0.52. In that case, the viral capsid contains 14 VP1 proteins; however, our model predicts that the optimal escape probability P optimal is maximal for 23 VP1.\n\nSupporting equations are available at http://www.biophysj.org/biophysj/ supplemental/S0006-3495(11)05468-3."}
