{"title": "Inflammatory Lung Disease O.12.1 From SARS and avian flu to swine flu", "body": "different laboratories, the causative agent was quickly identified to be a newly described strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [9, 10] . A variety of wild animals such as bats, palm civet, and raccoon dogs, have been shown to be the natural reservoir for this virus [11] [12] [13] . Children acquired the infection from close contact of an infected adult and they have a mild course of the illness while severe pneumonia with progressive deterioration leading to respiratory failure is commonly seen in adolescents and adults [6] . For many adult and pediatric patients, their initial radiographs may be normal while early thoracic computer tomography may show poorly defined, ground-glass opacification of the lung in the subpleural areas [3, 6] . The typical triphasic course of illness in infected adults is characterized by an initial stage with fever, chills, myalgia, cough and other constitutional symptoms lasting for a few days to a week after an incubation period of 5-10 day [1, 3] . They would then develop progressive clinical and radiological deterioration, and increasing oxygen requirement and up to 20-30% of them would develop respiratory failure. Gradual recovery is expected in over 80% of patients by 3-4 weeks into the illness. The non-specific laboratory findings such as lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevation of liver enzymes are common in severely ill patients [6] . No clinical or initial laboratory results can reliably differentiate SARS from pneumonia due to other viral or bacterial etiologies [14, 15] . Clinical suspicion due to contact with infected adults would prompt early investigation to confirm the diagnosis by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to detect the virus in respiratory secretions and plasma [16] . Such early diagnosis is important for isolating the infected cases in order to prevent further spread of the infection. Despite many studies conducted in adults and children, the exact pathophysisolgy of SARS remains unclear. The explanation for the marked difference of clinical severity between infected adults and young children remain unknown [16, 17] . The SARS-CoV may behave like H5N1 influenza virus and act as a potent inducer of proinflammatory cytokines. H5N1 influenza has been shown to upregulate the production of various cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) [18] . Such cytokine storm may lead to recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils resulting in inflammatory damage to the lung and other end-organs damage. The treatment of SARS in paediatric patients was largely supportive [2, 6] . No drug has been proven to be effective in treating this infection [16] . Experimental study showed that ribavirin is ineffective against SARS-associated coronavirus [18] . Although corticosteroid was widely used in the initial stage of the outbreak in Hong Kong, this treatment resulted in more acute and long term complications rather than clear clinical benefits [19] . Most pediatric patients recovered uneventfully, but about onethird of the patients still demonstrated radiologic abnormalities on high-resolution computer tomography (HRCT) of the lungs at 2 yrs after diagnosis [20] . Impaired peak oxygen consumption and lower oxygen uptake efficiency were common findings at 15 months follow-up [21] . It is reassuring that there has not been any outbreak since 2003 once the sales of related wild animals in wet markets were made illegal in Southern China. We should still be on the alert when we encounter any child with such clinical picture because contact of wild animals can still infect humans to start an outbreak again. Human infection with avian influenza: Avian influenza commonly affects wild birds and domestic poultry. These virusus are species-specific such that animal-to-human transmission is very uncommon. In the past, reassortment of the viral genome could result in pandemics such as those occurred in 1957 and 1968. Such process of reassortment is more likely to occur in areas when domestic poultry and pigs are living in close proximity to humans. In Southern China, the sales of live poultry in wet markets increase the chance of the transmission of infection from birds to humans. Recent molecular analysis of the genome of the 1918 virus revealed that this virus was most likely to an avian virus that has adapted to infect humans [22] . To minimize the impact of such outbreaks in the future, meticulous surveillance program is needed to monitor the infection in wild birds and domestic poultry. The first outbreak of human disease of avian influenza occurred in 1997 in Hong Kong with a total of 18 cases and 6 deaths [23, 24] . In contrast to SARS, the reported morbidity and mortality of human disease of avian influenza are very high in both adults and children [7] . The transmission of avian influenza between humans is inefficient, but there are reports of probable person-to-person transmission highlights the pandemic potential of new infection in humans [23] . Epidemiology and clinical course: For any new strain of influenza to become a pandemic strain, it has to be able to infect large number of humans who has no immunity against it. Furthermore, the ability of the infection to be transmitted between humans is important to perpetuate the spread of the infection. Outbreaks of avian influenza in chicken farms were noted to precede the report of human cases in Hong Kong [24] . Subsequent H5N1 virus isolated from humans was to have showed >99% sequence homology to the avian isolates [25] . Studies from Vietnam and Thailand did not reveal any evidence of asymptomatic infections among contacts of index cases [26, 27] . Therefore, human-to-human transmission is rather inefficient. Clinical presentation and diagnosis of avian influenza: Our knowledge of human H5N1 infections is primarily based on the reported cases of hospitalized patients [7] . Most infected cases were previously healthy children or adults. The presenting features are non-specific and are similar to other influenza infections. However, the disease usually progresses rapidly within the first week to respiratory failure in both infected adults and children [7, 24] . Multi-organ failure resulting in death occurred in more than 50% of the reported cases. Laboratory studies usually showed lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated aminotransferase levels [28] . Laboratory diagnosis is made by viral isolation or by PCRbased molecular detection of specific RNA. A history of exposure to wild birds and poultry and rapid downhill course in any patient should prompt the physician to think of this diagnosis. Management of avian influenza: Human avian influenza infection is a life-threatening disease in previously healthy adults and children. The postulated mechanism to explain such severity is that the virus can activate multiple pathways of innate immunity resulting in a cytokine storm [29] . With such uncontrolled upregulation of many cytokine pathways, severe pneumonia and multi-organ damage can occur. Autopsy cases revealed reactive hemophagocytic activities in lungs and bone marrow [29] . Further studies are needed to clarify the precise pathophysiolgical mechanism resulting in such severe disease and to shine light on possible effective treatment for this potentially fatal infection. Since many patients will deteriorate rapidly within the first week of illness, patients suspected or proven to have H5N1 influenza should be hospitalized in facilities with proper isolation facility. Patients should be treated with neuraminidase inhibitor while waiting for confirmatory testing [7, 30, 31] . Development of effective vaccines is necessary to minimize the scale of outbreaks in humans if this virus were able to adapt to the host with enhance human-to human transmission capability. The pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza: Just as scientists and health care professionals were preparing measures to combat the possible pandemic which might be caused by the H5N1 virus, a new strain of H1N1 emerged in early 2009 in North America. Early reports from Mexico were alarming that the mortality might be very high in previously healthy young adults and children [32, 33] . This infection was inappropriately termed as \"swine flu (H1N1)\" because component of its genome has segments of swine virus lineage. The reassortment of 6 gene segments from the triple reassortant swine-origin virus and 2 gene segments from Eurasian influenza A (H1N1) swine virus resulted in the formation of this new virus [34] . Within two months of the discovery of this new virus, on June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the alert level to the highest (6) indicating the on-going pandemic of this viral infection [35] . Subsequent reports from various countries confirmed that this infection is rather mild despite the high infectivity among humans. Most infected children or adults recover uneventfully with supportive treatment. However, continuing monitoring across the world is important to reveal the true impact of this infection globally. Epidemiology and clinical manifestations: This new infection was first identified from adults and children from Southern California and Mexico in the spring of 2009. Reports from Mexico and Canada were rather alarming that the morbidity and mortality were rather high in patients admitted into intensive care units [32, 33] . As opposed to the higher mortality of the usual seasonal influenza in the elderly and debilitated persons, a large number of deaths were found in previously healthy children and young adults. A pediatric report from Argentina revealed that the overall rate of death of 1.1 per 100,000 was 10 times the rate of seasonal influenza in previous years [36] . Our experience in Hong Kong was quite different that most infected children would recover uneventfully. No observed increased mortality was noted when compared to seasonal influenza in our locality. Similar to seasonal influenza, this new strain of influenza is thought to be transmitted by droplet or contact exposure, and airborne exposure. After an incubation period of 1-7 days, patients would present with cough, fever, sore throat, headache, muscle aches, nausea, diarrhoea similar to the seasonal influenza [37] . Adults and children with underlying medical conditions and obesity are at risk of more severe course of the illness [38, 39] . Severe organ dysfunction and hypoxia at presentation are prognostic factor for mortality in two large series of critically ill patients [32, 33] . Diagnosis and treatment: In most countries, this new H1N1 strain has become the predominant strain causing influenza like illness. Routine testing is no longer recommended unless the patients are severe enough to require hospitalization. In suspected cases, a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab can be sent for realtime reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test to confirm the present of the H1 N1 virus [8] . The currently commercially available rapid test for the diagnosis of seasonal influenza A cannot be used for screening patients with possible new H1N1 infection [40] [41] [42] . Only RT-PCR and viral isolation are the definitive tests to confirm this infection Almost all strains of the 2009 H1N1 virus are still susceptible to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) but they are resistant to adamantanes. Only patients severe enough to be hospitalized or high risk patients should be treated with anti-viral agents [68] . The FDA has also issued Emergency Use Authorization approving the use of oseltamivir for treating children under one yr of age [8] . There are several new licensed vaccinations available for the prevention of this infection. A single dose for children above 10 years is effective while those younger will require 2 doses [43] . Given the limitation of supply in the beginning, the high risk target groups should be given priority of vaccination. These groups include pregnant women, health care workers, adults 25 to 64 years with underlying risk factors, children between 6 months to 24 months. Given the current treatment and preventive measures that we have for this virus, the initial wave of the pandemic appears milder than we originally expected. Continuing surveillance is required to monitor the second wave of the pandemic. The pathogenicity and response to treatment of the new virus will also need to be monitor carefully.\n\nThe outbreak and control of SARS in 2003 clearly highlighted the importance of international collaboration and effective public health measures in stopping the spread of a newly emerged infection. The transmission of avian influenza between humans is relatively inefficient. However, mutation of the avian strain can result in more efficient transmission. The control of avian influenza is difficult as the natural reservoirs of avian influenza cannot be eliminated. Our initial battle against the 2009 H1N1 pandemic seems to be successful. However, the next virus is definitely coming and it is just a matter of time. To reduce the impact of such pandemic, we will need to prepare ourselves for the availability of isolation facility, the development of effective antiviral agents, rapid response of vaccine development. Development of sensitive and accurate early diagnostic tests is crucial for the successful control of the outbreak at the source. With all the important lessons learnt from managing these new infectons, we will be ablt to reduce the global impact of any upcoming pandemic.\n\nCurrent diagnostic tests lack sensitivity for the identification of the bacterial etiology of pneumonia. Over the past 20 years, there have been numerous attempts to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of detection of bacterial pathogens in pneumonia, including, but not limited to, different sampling approaches, antibody-antigen complexes, or polymerase chain reaction. It is fair to state that these approaches have, in general, been disappointing. Surrogate markers for specific pathogens (e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae) have been proposed, particularly in the context of developing countries, making use of conjugate vaccine studies as probes. Among pneumococcal diagnostics currently under investigation, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction of respiratory secretions, as well as urinary antigen detection and serological analyses, are all potential candidates for use in future clinical trials. The purpose of this talk will be to describe methodologies in diagnosis of bacterial pulmonary infections, with a particular emphasis on novel approaches to establish the etiology of infection. Summary: Lung infections are a frequent cause of morbidity in immunocompromised children. This group of patients includes children with congenital defects of host defense and defects in cellmediated and humoral immunity, and -much more frequentlychildren treated for malignancy and autoimmune diseases, patients after bone marrow or solid organ transplantation, and children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Thus, the paediatric population at risk for opportunistic infections has significantly increased in the recent past and the number of organisms causing lung infections in these patients is extensive and ever-growing. The clinical presentations of lung infections in immunocompromised children are often non-specific, and the clinical management is complex due to the availability of many diagnostic tools and the broad range of antimicrobial agents potentially needed for treatment, implicating an increased risk of adverse drug effects. The diagnostic work-up is complicated by many non-infectious processes that simulate infection in the populations at risk. A rapid and often invasive diagnostic approach followed by early initiation of effective treatment is crucial for the clinical outcome. Clinical presentation and important pathogens: The clinical presentations of lung infections in immunocompromised children are often non-specific, and thus not helpful for establishing specific diagnoses. Patients may either be infected with a common pathogen (e.g. respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and varicella zoster virus) and then present with an atypical disease course, or with an opportunistic pathogen (e.g. Pneumocystis jirovecii) presenting with very variable clinical courses, depending on the degree of residual immunity. It is vital to identify unusual patterns of common infections and rare infections which suggest immunodeficiency in order to enable early diagnosis and appropriate (i.e. aggressive) treatment to prevent sequelae such as bronchiectasis and respiratory failure. The underlying disorders (malignancy, bone marrow and solid organ transplantation, primary immunodeficiencies, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome -AIDS) are each associated with specific respiratory pathogens; further, the types of pulmonary complications seen in bone marrow transplantation vary with the time after transplantation. Combined immunodeficiencies often present with persistent viral infection, whereas antibody deficiencies present with recurrent bacterial infection. drug-induced lung injury, radiation pneumonitis, and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis) have to be considered as differential diagnoses in the diagnostic work-up of immunocompromised children presenting with respiratory signs and symptoms. Diagnostic studies: Imaging: Plain chest radiographs are insensitive and usually not helpful in establishing a specific diagnosis; they often show atypical features, and in some cases they may be normal. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is much more sensitive, thus improving diagnostic accuracy and allowing for earlier diagnosis. In addition, it can be of help in planning invasive procedures such as flexible bronchoscopy or lung biopsy. The radiological appearance of lung infection in the immunocompromised child varies and includes diffuse alveolar and/or interstitial pneumonitis (common causative pathogens include P. jirovecii and cytomegalovirus), lobular or lobar pneumonitis (with S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and H. influenzae as typical pathogens), and solitary or multiple nodular infiltrates, cavitary lesions or lung abscess (causative pathogens include Aspergillus sp. and Mycobacteria). However, the radiographic findings as a product of both the pathogen and the response of the child may not adequately reflect pulmonary involvement, in particular in patients with pronounced neutropenia. Bronchiectasis is a common complication in the immunocompromised child; typical radiologic features include hyperinflation and bronchial wall thickening, with or without dilatation. Methods for pathogen detection: Blood cultures: While a blood culture should be obtained in immunocompromised children suspected of having lung infection, a positive result is unusual. (Induced) Sputum: Sputum analysis may be helpful when pathogens which do not normally colonise the upper respiratory tract are isolated (e.g. M. tuberculosis or Legionella sp.). In particular, induced sputum has a role for the diagnosis of P. jirovecii in AIDS patients. However, non-invasive methods only rarely allow to establish a specific diagnosis in immunocompromised children with lung infection.\n\nIn intubated patients, tracheal aspirates and non-bronchoscopic samples are easy to obtain and have a favourable diagnostic yield as compared with non-invasive methods. Flexible bronchoscopy and BAL: In immunocompromised children, flexible bronchoscopy and BAL represent a very useful technique,"}
