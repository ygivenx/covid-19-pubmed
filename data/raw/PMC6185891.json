{"title": "Seasonality and clinical impact of human parainfluenza viruses", "body": "Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) types 1\u20104 are common respiratory pathogens that cause both upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses, especially in young children.1 HPIV\u20101 and HPIV\u20102 are more common in children and more often associated with croup.1 HPIV\u20103 is more frequently associated with bronchiolitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. HPIV\u20104, while least well\u2010characterized, has been described as associated with both mild illness in children and lower respiratory tract disease.2 HPIV types have varying seasonality, prevalence, and clinical manifestations. In the United States, HPIV\u20101 usually occurs in the fall of odd numbered years, HPIV\u20102 occurs every fall, and HPIV\u20103 occurs in spring and summer.1, 3 The seasonality of HPIV\u20104 has not been as well defined, often due to its low prevalence.4 A recent study conducted in Colorado found a year\u2010round prevalence of HPIV\u20104 with peaks in the fall of odd numbered years.5 However, estimates of HPIV\u20104 prevalence are increasing, potentially due to improved and increased diagnostic testing, but few recent studies have assessed this.6, 7\n\n\nWidespread availability of multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) assays allows for more in\u2010depth studies of the epidemiology and impact of HPIV types. The population of this study included both a community\u2010based cohort and hospitalized children and adults with laboratory\u2010detected HPIV. The inclusion of the community cohort allowed for a broader evaluation of the impact of HPIV than has been previously assessed. The study's objectives were to (a) assess the seasonality of HPIV types 1\u20104, (b) determine clinical outcomes by HPIV type, and (c) identify risk factors for increased severity of illness.\n\nA retrospective study of participants in a community surveillance cohort and hospitalized patients with HPIV types 1\u20104 detected from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015 was performed. The community cohort was derived from the Mobile Surveillance for Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs) and Influenza\u2010like Illness (ILI) in the Community (MoSAIC) study, a 5\u2010year community\u2010based surveillance study in New York City (NYC) that includes 250 households annually.8, 9 Households were identified by contacting a random sample of participants who had taken part in a large population\u2010based survey of an urban, primarily immigrant Latino community. For this study, eligible households had 3 or more members with at least 1 member under 18 years of age, were Spanish\u2010 or English\u2010speaking, and had a cellular telephone with text messaging.8 Text messages were sent twice weekly inquiring about possible respiratory illness among household members. Nasal swabs were collected from ill participants by research staff if at least two of the following were reported to be present: fever/feverishness, runny nose/congestion, sore throat, cough, and/or myalgia. For infants, either runny nose or congestion prompted collection of a swab.\n\nHospitalized adults and children with laboratory\u2010detected HPIV admitted to a university\u2010affiliated medical center in NYC located in the same neighborhood as the community cohort were included. Testing was requested by treating clinicians, and as per the standard of care, is generally recommended for all hospitalizations to evaluate acute respiratory symptoms and guide transmission precautions. Patients hospitalized within 2 calendar\u2010days of HPIV detection were included. Those with HPIV detected >2 days before admission, >2 days after admission and those with a second positive test for the same HPIV type within 4 weeks of the first positive test were excluded.\n\nNasopharyngeal swabs for both the community cohort and the hospitalized patients were tested for respiratory pathogens using multiplex RT\u2010PCR (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc. Salt Lake City, Utah) which has been reported to have 91%\u2010100% sensitivity and 98%\u2010100% specificity for HPIV types 1\u20104 and detects 20 respiratory pathogens including HPIV, adenovirus, coronavirus (HKU1, NL63, 229E, OC43), human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza virus (A, A/H1, A/H3, A/H1\u2010 2009, B), respiratory syncytial virus, Mycoplasma, Bordetella pertussis, and Chlamydophila.10, 11 Swabs from the community were tested in a research laboratory at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC). Swabs from hospitalized patients were tested in the clinical microbiology laboratory at NewYork\u2010Presbyterian Hospital at CUMC. Blood, urine, and respiratory tract cultures for bacteria were sent by treating clinicians as per the standard of care for suspected infections and also processed by the clinical microbiology laboratory.\n\nFor the community cohort, days of missed school or work; medical care in primary care clinics, urgent care, or emergency departments; hospitalizations; and use of antibiotics were collected by follow\u2010up calls at least 15 days after the resolution of respiratory illness.\n\nFor hospitalized patients, demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from electronic medical records (EMR). Primary ICD\u20109 diagnoses were categorized as respiratory or nonrespiratory. Patients\u2019 primary and secondary diagnoses were categorized into groups of chronic conditions previously described as risk factors for severe respiratory disease in adults and children with respiratory viruses.12, 13, 14 Conditions were excluded if they could not be classified within a chronic condition category, had <15 occurrences across all patients, or have not been associated with severe respiratory disease, for example bipolar disorder. Manual chart review of readmitted patients was performed to determine whether readmissions within 4 weeks were due to respiratory illness.\n\nHospital course and healthcare utilization data were obtained from the EMR including radiographs within 2 days of HPIV detection; all antibiotics within 2 days prior to or 7 days after HPIV detection; ICU admission and 30\u2010day mortality. Respiratory support including use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was determined by billed procedure codes. Use of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) or oxygen supplementation was not assessed, as accurate usage data were unavailable in structured electronic sources.\n\nTo assess seasonality, epidemiologic curves that modeled the detection of each HPIV type in the community cohort versus hospitalized patients were created. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups were analyzed as proportions, means, and/or medians; associations between HPIV type and clinical course were examined using chi\u2010square, Fisher's exact, and ANOVA tests, as appropriate.\n\nA respiratory severity index was adapted to examine the association of HPIV type with severity of illness.15 Three severity categories were created: mild, moderate, and severe. The severe category included patients who died within 30 days of HPIV detection, required ECMO or were mechanically ventilated. Moderate illness included those who were admitted to an ICU or required CPAP which can be provided on non\u2010ICU floors as well as ICUs. Mild illness included all others.\n\nPutative risk factors for illness severity were examined among hospitalized patients. Bivariate analyses first considered the distribution of illness severity category by levels of possible risk factors. Variables with a significance of P < 0.10 in bivariable analysis were included in the multivariable ordinal logistic regression models which were used to regress the odds of illness severity. Initial analyses showed interactions between HPIV type and age likely reflecting heterogeneous populations with different risk factors for severe illness. Thus, different severity models were created for adult and pediatric patients. Multilevel categorical variables were assessed using likelihood ratio tests. The final models were created using a manual backward elimination method, keeping HPIV type included, and dropping the variable with the largest P\u2010value first until all other remaining variables were significant (P < 0.05). All statistical analyses were performed in SAS 9.4.16\n\n\nIn the community cohort, 1805 swabs were obtained, of which 69 (4%) of 1753 participants were positive for at least one HPIV type (Figure 1A). The 69 HPIV\u2010positive swabs were from 59 households; 10 (14%) households had two individuals with the same HPIV type detected. HPIV\u20104 was most common (36.2%). Participants with HPIV detected had a mean and median age of 18.0 (SD: \u00b118.8) and 9.2 (IQR: 2.82\u201030.5) years, respectively; 100% identified as Latino (reflective of the cohort's demographics); and 75% were publicly insured (Table 1). Demographic and clinical characteristics and outcomes were similar among participants with different HPIV types. The most commonly reported symptoms were rhinorrhea (70%) and cough (67%). Twenty\u2010two (32%) participants reported seeking medical care, nine (15%) reported antibiotic use, none were hospitalized and 20 (29%) reported at least 1 day of missed work or school by participants or caregivers (median 1 [IQR: 1\u20102] day per episode in which work or school was missed).\n\nDuring the study period, 1607 (4%) of 40 461 multiplex RT\u2010PCR tests processed in the clinical microbiology laboratory were positive for at least one HPIV type (Figure 1B). Overall, 711 (44%) tests (680 hospitalizations for 663 patients) were positive within 2 days of hospital admission and HPIV\u20103 was most common (52.4%). The mean and median age of hospitalized patients were 29.7 (SD: \u00b133.5) years and 6.8 (IQR: 1.4\u201064.3) years, respectively; 45% were white; 38% were Hispanic; and 74% had at least one chronic condition and 24% had \u22654 chronic conditions. Sex, age, and number/type of chronic conditions varied by HPIV type; those with HPIV\u20103 were significantly older (Table 2).\n\nSeasonality for the four HPIV types was similar in the community cohort and among hospitalized patients (Figure 2). HPIV\u20101 largely occurred in the summer and fall of odd numbered years. HPIV\u20102 was rarely detected with the exception of the fall of 2014. HPIV\u20103 occurred in spring and summer each year. HPIV\u20104 occurred following HPIV\u20103 each year in late summer through late fall.\n\nThe mean length of hospitalization was 5.3 (SD \u00b1 8.4) days and varied by HPIV type (Table 3). The proportion of patients with a respiratory diagnosis varied among HPIV types (highest for HPIV\u20104). The proportion of those with chest x\u2010rays obtained (highest for HPIV\u20103) and receiving antibiotics (highest for HPIV\u20104) also varied by HPIV type. Overall, 112 (16%) patients were admitted to an ICU, 74 (11%) required CPAP, 29 (4%) were ventilated, and 2 (<1%) required ECMO. Those with HPIV\u20104 were more likely to have an ICU admission and had a longer ICU stay than those with other HPIV types. The crude 30\u2010day mortality rate was 2%. The mean and median age of those who died were 28.4 and 6.8 years, respectively, and only one patient who died had no comorbid conditions. Overall, 118 patients had positive bacterial cultures including 37 blood, 41 urine, and 40 respiratory cultures. The types of viral co\u2010detections (overall 18%) and of positive bacterial cultures were similar among patients with different HPIV types (Table 3).\n\nAmong all hospitalized patients with HPIV, 35 (5%) had severe, 124 (18%) had moderate, and 521 (77%) had mild illnesses. Among the 390 children, 23 (6%) had severe, 83 (21%) had moderate, and 162 (73%) had mild illness (Table 4). In the final adjusted model for children, HPIV\u20104, and respiratory and cardiovascular conditions were associated with higher odds of increased severity of illness. Among the 290 adults, 12 (4%) had severe, 41 (14%) had moderate, and 237 (82%) had mild illness (Table 5). In the final adjusted model for adults, age \u226565 years and respiratory conditions were associated with higher odds of increased severity of illness.\n\nWe had a unique opportunity to compare the epidemiology and clinical impact of HPIV types among individuals in a community\u2010based surveillance study and among hospitalized patients during the same time and in the same geographic area. The seasonality of HPIV types 1\u20103 was consistent with published trends,1, 3 but we found that HPIV\u20104 occurred annually in late summer and fall, suggestive of a local epidemiologic trend that has not been previously described. We found that HPIV\u20103 was most common among hospitalized patients (52%) while HPIV\u20104 was most common in the community cohort (36%). The relative frequency of HPIV\u20104 has varied depending on the population studied; among hospitalized Chinese children under 5 years of age17 and among children hospitalized in Colorado,5 it was the second most common HPIV type (18% vs 31%, respectively) while among children \u226424 months attending day care, second only to HPIV\u20103, 10% of HPIV illnesses were due to HPIV\u20104.18\n\n\nIn the community cohort of the current study, demographic, and clinical characteristics, and outcomes associated with different HPIV types were similar. HPIV\u2010associated illnesses contributed to healthcare burden and cost as 32% of ARI episodes were medically attended, 9% received antibiotics, and 29% missed work or school. Few studies have examined HPIV in a community\u2010based cohort, but among infants in daycare, the clinical presentations and severity of illness were also similar with different HPIV types.18\n\n\nDemographic and clinical characteristics, and outcomes did vary by HPIV type in hospitalized patients. Those with HPIV\u20103 had longer hospitalizations, were more likely to be \u226565 years old, and have \u22654 chronic conditions. They were also more likely to have chest x\u2010rays performed, potentially reflective of their underlying conditions. In contrast, those with HPIV\u20104 all received antibiotics and were more likely to have an ICU admission with longer ICU stays. Those with HPIV\u20104 were most likely to have a primary respiratory diagnosis, supporting the pathogenicity of HPIV\u20104 as previously reported.19, 20\n\n\nWe modified a previously validated severity of illness score to further explore the predictors of illness severity. In children, increased severity of illness was associated with respiratory conditions, cardiovascular conditions and HPIV\u20104 while in adults, increased severity of illness was associated with age \u226565 years and cardiovascular conditions. The association of comorbid conditions and severe illness in those with HPIV is consistent with other respiratory viruses, most notably RSV and influenza, which both can exacerbate underlying cardiac and pulmonary conditions.12, 13, 14, 21, 22 This may also explain why 21% of hospitalized patients had a nonrespiratory primary diagnosis.\n\nThe rate of co\u2010detection was similar across HPIV strains and as others have shown, viral co\u2010detections did not impact severity of disease.23 However, due to limited sample size, we could not assess the impact of specific co\u2010infections. While only 17% of HPIV\u2010positive patients had a positive bacterial culture, 73% received at least one dose of an antibiotic between 2 days before and 7 days after HPIV detection. Thus, most antibiotic usage represented empiric therapy, suggesting an opportunity for antibiotic stewardship.\n\nThis study had limitations. The community cohort was 100% Hispanic/Latino, reducing the study's generalizability, and small, limiting our ability to find differences in severity of illness or symptomatology associated with HPIV types. Our hospital is a referral center and cares for many patients with underlying conditions. Furthermore, its referral status could impact accurate interpretation of \u201clocal\u201d epidemiology as only 32% of the hospitalized patients lived in the same zip codes as the MoSAIC study participants (M. Stockwell, personal communication). Testing of hospitalized patients relied on clinicians\u2019 judgement. We did not review radiographic findings or capture BiPAP use which may have biased assessment of severity of illness. The severity of illness score was developed for children and not previously tested in adults. Use of administrative data restricted our ability to assess patients\u2019 symptomatology. Although most patients had a respiratory diagnosis, we may have misclassified HPIV infections that actually represented prolonged HPIV shedding from previous illnesses. We did not classify positive bacterial cultures as consistent with infection vs. colonization vs. contamination.\n\nIn this study, each HPIV type demonstrated seasonality, but each was similar in the community and among hospitalized patients. We found that HPIV\u20104 had distinct epidemiology, not previously described, and was associated with increased severity of illness in hospitalized children. As demonstrated for other respiratory viruses, older age and underlying conditions, particularly respiratory and cardiac conditions, were associated with increased severity of illness. Additional studies exploring HPIV incidence and severity in both children and adults could help reinforce the need for vaccine development.\n\nNone."}
