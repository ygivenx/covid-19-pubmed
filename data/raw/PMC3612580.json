{"title": "Differences between asthmatics and nonasthmatics hospitalised with\ninfluenza A infection", "body": "Descriptive analyses were performed comparing patients with and without asthma.\nThe diagnosis of asthma was based on records in the medical case notes at the\ntime of hospital admission and did not require documentation of confirmatory\nspirometry. These analyses were also performed separately for children\n(aged <16 years) and adults; p-values were calculated using the\nChi-squared test for categorical exposure variables.\n\nA nested case\u2013control analysis of the surveillance cohort was used to\ninvestigate the association between a diagnosis of asthma and severe outcome\nfrom H1N1pdm 2009 infection, the latter being defined as death or the need for\nlevel 2 (high dependency unit) or level 3 (intensive care\nunit) care while in hospital. Patients with \u201csevere outcomes\u201d\nconstituted \u201ccases\u201d. Potential confounding variables in the\nmultivariable logistic regression were identified from both our previous work\ninvestigating risk factors for severe outcomes in the same cohort [11] and an a priori\nconceptual framework based on the descriptive analyses. The effect of the\nfollowing covariates on the relationship between asthma and severe outcomes was\nindependently assessed by introducing them separately, in turn, into the\noriginal model: age; comorbidities (using the Charlson index, excluding\nasthma cases) [14]; immune\ncompromise; season of admission; severity of illness at admission (severe\nrespiratory distress; increased respiratory rate; oxygen saturation\n\u226492%; respiratory exhaustion; severe clinical dehydration or shock;\naltered consciousness; dyspnoea and C-reactive protein levels);\npre-admission inhaled steroid use; time to hospital admission (from symptom\nonset); in-hospital antiviral use; in-hospital antibiotic use; and\nin-hospital oral/intravenous corticosteroid use. Any covariate that modified the\noriginal unadjusted odds ratio by at least 10% towards a null association\nwas then included in the final multivariable logistic regression model. If the\nassociation of asthma with less severe outcomes was fully explained by\nassociated comorbidities or treatments, then the adjusted odds ratio of asthma\nwith severe outcomes would be expected to approximate one in the final\nmultivariate model.\n\nBy way of a further check on the robustness of our findings, an expanded\nmultivariable analysis was also performed including all covariates that were\nindependently associated with both exposure (asthma) and outcome.\nResults are presented as adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence\nintervals. A p-value of <0.05 was taken to be statistically significant.\nSTATA (release 11; StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) was used for\nall statistical analyses.\n\nThe association of asthma with severe outcomes (unadjusted OR 0.51,\n95% CI 0.36\u20130.72) was unaffected by age (adjusted OR\n0.49, 95% CI 0.35\u20130.70), presence of comorbidities as measured\nby the Charlson score (adjusted OR 0.51, 95% CI\n0.36\u20130.72), immune compromise (adjusted OR 0.51, 95% CI\n0.36\u20130.72), in-hospital antiviral use (adjusted OR 0.49,\n95% 0.34\u20130.69), in-hospital antibiotic use (adjusted OR\n0.49, 95% CI 0.35\u20130.70) or season (spring\nversus autumn/winter and first versus\nsecond pandemic wave) of admission (adjusted OR 0.51, 95% CI\n0.36\u20130.72). In a further analysis to avoid linear assumptions\nregarding age and based on differences in age between asthmatics and\nnonasthmatics (table\n1), the association of asthma with severe outcomes was adjusted\nfor age <5 years (adjusted OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.35\u20130.71)\nand age 16\u201345 years (adjusted OR 0.52, 95% CI\n0.36\u20130.74).\n\nIn contrast, point estimates of the association of asthma with severe outcome\nwere reduced by >10% when adjusted independently for pre-admission\ninhaled corticosteroid use (adjusted OR 0.63, 95% CI\n0.42\u20130.94) and \u201cadmission \u22644 days from symptom onset\u201d\n(adjusted OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43\u20130.95) (further\nresults are given in online supplementary table D). In a multivariate model\nincluding both these covariates (pre-admission inhaled corticosteroids and\nadmission \u22644 days from symptom onset), the association of asthma with a\ndecreased likelihood of severe outcomes then failed to maintain statistical\nsignificance (adjusted OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.45\u20131.17)\n(table 3).\nIn the multivariate model including all covariates independently associated with\nboth exposure (asthma) and outcome, the association of asthma with a\ndecreased likelihood of severe outcomes was again nonsignificant (adjusted\nOR 0.62, 95% CI 0.36\u20131.05; p=0.075), but pre-admission\ninhaled corticosteroids appeared protective (adjusted OR 0.34, 95%\nCI 0.18\u20130.66; p=0.001) as was early hospital admission\n(adjusted OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38\u20130.94; p=0.025)\n(table\n4).\n\nThe impact of in-hospital systemic (oral/i.v.)\ncorticosteroid use on the association of asthma with severe outcomes was\ncomplex. An interaction between asthma status and the association of systemic\ncorticosteroids with severe outcomes was observed; in asthmatics, systemic\ncorticosteroids were associated with a decreased likelihood of severe outcomes\n(OR 0.36 adjusted for pre-admission inhaled corticosteroids and admission\n\u22644 days from symptom onset, 95% CI 0.18\u20130.72;\np=0.004), while in nonasthmatics, systemic corticosteroids were\nassociated with an increased likelihood of severe outcomes (OR 3.53\nadjusted for pre-admission inhaled corticosteroids and admission \u22644 days from\nsymptom onset, 95% CI 2.16\u20135.78; p<0.001).\n\nPost-hoc analysis of asthmatics on pre-admission inhaled corticosteroids compared\nwith asthmatics not on pre-admission inhaled corticosteroids did not demonstrate\nany significant differences between the two groups in relation to the number of\nother (nonasthma) comorbid illnesses and presenting features, except\nthat asthmatics on inhaled corticosteroids were significantly more likely to\ncomplain of dyspnoea (64.5% versus 51.7%,\nunadjusted OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.13\u20132.56) and to meet triage\ncriteria for severe respiratory distress (73.9%\nversus 62.1%, unadjusted OR 1.73, 95% CI\n1.12\u20132.67) (table\n5). Asthmatics on inhaled corticosteroids were significantly\nless likely to suffer a severe outcome compared with asthmatics not on inhaled\nsteroids (7.4% versus 15.4%, unadjusted OR\n0.44, 95% CI 0.23\u20130.85). Of the 254 patients on pre-admission\ninhaled corticosteroids, 51 (20.1%) patients were designated\nnonasthmatics. There was no evidence of benefit from pre-admission inhaled\ncorticosteroids in nonasthmatics (unadjusted OR 0.99, 95% CI\n0.49\u20132.00; p=0.968).\n\nAsthma was the commonest comorbid illness in the FLU-CIN cohort, as observed\nconsistently in other national and international cohorts [5, 7, 8]. In keeping with previous studies [5, 7,\n8], a striking reduction in the likelihood\nof dying or requiring intensive care level support in asthmatics compared with\nnonasthmatics was noted. However, we found no evidence to suggest that asthmatics\nhad a milder illness at the time of hospital admission to explain the lower rates of\nintensive care unit admission and death. Instead, the proportions of patients with\nradiologically confirmed pneumonia were very similar in asthmatics and nonasthmatics\n(17% versus 16.6%). In addition, compared\nwith nonasthmatics, asthmatics had features indicative of greater respiratory\ncompromise at the time of hospital admission; the latter being reflected in higher\nrates of dyspnoea, severe respiratory distress, respiratory exhaustion, oxygen\nsaturations \u226492% and need for supplemental oxygen. These features suggest\nthat a lower threshold for hospital referral and admission in patients with asthma\nis an unlikely explanation for the observed association of asthma with less severe\noutcomes in hospitalised patients.\n\nInterestingly, nonasthmatics were significantly more likely to be immunocompromised\n(n=40) compared with asthmatics (n=2). A Canadian\ncohort study comparing hospitalised solid organ transplant recipients and\nnonimmunocompromised patients with pandemic H1N1pdm infection also found that asthma\nwas more common in nonimmunocompromised patients [15]. The reasons behind these observations warrant future\ninvestigation.\n\nAlthough patients with asthma were more likely to receive antiviral and antibiotic\ntreatment following admission to hospital, the association of asthma with less\nsevere clinical outcomes was not influenced by in-patient antiviral use, antibiotic\nuse, or by differences in age. Instead, factors related to the management of asthma\nwere found to be more relevant; specifically the use of pre-admission inhaled\ncorticosteroids, earlier admission to hospital (within 4 days of symptom\nonset) and in-hospital systemic (oral or intravenous) corticosteroid\nuse.\n\nLimitations of this study were that diagnoses of asthma recorded in case notes were\nnot verified by reference to baseline spirometric data; in addition, the severity of\nairflow obstruction at the time of hospital admission, as measured by peak\nexpiratory flow rates, was not captured in the FLU-CIN database. However, the lack\nof peak flow data would not have affected the main analysis comparing asthmatics\nversus nonasthmatics. The effect of comorbidities on the\nassociation of asthma with severe outcomes was adjusted for using the Deyo\nadaptation of the Charlson index score, which is a weighted measure using\nInternational Classifiaction of Diseases-10 classification. However, no comorbidity\nscore is perfect and residual confounding cannot be completely excluded in this\nobservational dataset. Data on time from symptom onset to hospital admission were\navailable in 1,083 (71.3%) patients. There was no systematic reason\nfor missing data and patients with missing data were similar to other patients.\nTherefore, given the overall size of the FLU-CIN cohort and the strength of the\nassociations examined, it is unlikely that the missing data resulted in\nsignificantly altered results. Pandemic influenza vaccination status was not\nreliably recorded in the medical notes for all patients in the FLU-CIN cohort.\nAsthmatics, being in the target group for vaccination in the UK, may have been more\nlikely to have been vaccinated compared with nonasthmatics. As all patients in this\nstudy had laboratory-confirmed H1N1pdm infection, if any patient had received the\npandemic influenza vaccination, it had not prevented occurrence of infection. The\npossibility that vaccination of asthmatics may have attenuated the severity of\nillness remains. However, patients with other comorbid illnesses (who would\nhave been equally likely to receive early vaccination) were not observed to\nhave fewer severe outcomes, as had asthmatics. Therefore, a protective effect from\npandemic influenza vaccination is unlikely to explain the findings of the current\nstudy.\n\nThe value of early hospital referral of patients with exacerbations of asthma\ntriggered by influenza infection may relate to the earlier administration of\nantivirals which, in large cohort and population-based studies, has been associated\nwith improved outcomes [16]. Alternatively,\nthis may reflect the importance of prompt appropriate treatment of asthma, including\nthe administration of systemic corticosteroids, particularly in asthmatics not\nalready on corticosteroid treatment.\n\nAnother view is that inhaled steroid use and early hospital admission might simply be\nmarkers of well-treated and confirmed asthma managed by well-informed doctors; and\nthat asthmatics may have a different sort of illness from some nonasthmatics, this\nillness tending not to have such a severe ultimate outcome. The veracity of this\nview could not be explored within the current dataset. Patients with other chronic\nrespiratory disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, typically\nmanaged with inhaled and systemic steroids and were not observed to have a lower\nlikelihood of severe outcomes. This may reflect differences in the degree of\nresponse to treatment according to severity and chronicity of underlying lung\ndisease, with asthma generally being more responsive than other chronic lung\ndiseases [17].\n\nThe association between inhaled corticosteroid use in asthmatics and improved\nclinical outcomes is supported by findings from large epidemiological studies. Using\nthe Saskatchewan Health databases and a cohort of 30 569 asthmatics, Suissa\net al. [18] demonstrated\nthat regular use of low-dose inhaled steroids was associated with a decreased risk\nof death from asthma and with reductions of 31% in the rate of hospital\nadmissions for asthma [19]. Likewise, low\nadherence rates to asthma medication, particularly inhaled corticosteroids, are\nassociated with poorer asthma outcomes [20,\n21]. The benefits from inhaled\ncorticosteroids are thought to relate to their effects on airway inflammation and\nhyperresponsiveness and are not specific to any particular viral infection. Thus,\nalthough the current study focused on H1N1pdm infection, the observed benefit from\ninhaled corticosteroids on clinical outcomes in asthmatics would probably extend to\nother acute respiratory viral infections.\n\nThe relationship between asthma, in-hospital systemic corticosteroid use and clinical\noutcomes is more complicated. Some cohort studies of critically ill patients with\nH1N1pdm infection have reported an association of systemic corticosteroids with\nhigher mortality or higher rates of hospital-acquired pneumonia [22\u201324], while other studies have not identified any association between\nsystemic corticosteroid use and severe outcomes [25]. None of these studies differentiated between asthmatics and\nnonasthmatics. In the current study, systemic corticosteroids were associated with a\nlower likelihood of severe outcomes in asthmatics, while in nonasthmatics, there was\nan association with an increased likelihood of severe outcomes. This reflects the\nsubstantially different indications for administration of systemic corticosteroids\nin asthmatics compared with nonasthmatics. The benefit of systemic corticosteroids\nin the acute management of exacerbations of asthma is well described and rests on a\nlarge evidence base [26]. The findings from\nthis study support the principles of acute asthma management, including the use of\nsystemic corticosteroids for asthmatics hospitalised with influenza infection. In\ncontradistinction, for nonasthmatics, the role of systemic corticosteroids in the\nmanagement of severe influenza infections remains unclear and may even be harmful\n[27, 28]. In this study, corticosteroid use in nonasthmatics may have been\nmore frequent in severely ill cases and, therefore, its use may merely be a marker\nfor severe disease. However, this explanation alone does not account for the finding\nby Han\net al. [24] that patients\nwith H1N1pdm infection who were treated prospectively with corticosteroids as a\nfever suppressant suffered worse outcomes. An adequately powered randomised\ncontrolled trial is required to inform the current debate, taking into account the\npossibility that different clinical groups may have different types of disease and\nmay either benefit from or be harmed by steroid therapy.\n\nValidation of our results in a separate cohort would be a desirable next step. In the\nmeantime, the findings from this study emphasise the importance of compliance with\nregular inhaled corticosteroid use by asthmatics, especially in winter when\nrespiratory viruses are circulating. This study also supports the use of systemic\ncorticosteroids for asthmatics hospitalised with influenza infection, in accordance\nwith the principles of acute asthma management [29].\n\nIn conclusion, we found that asthmatics admitted to hospital with influenza infection\nwere half as likely as nonasthmatics to die or require intensive care support\ndespite greater respiratory compromise at the time of hospital admission and similar\nrates of pneumonia. Pre-admission use of inhaled corticosteroids and earlier\nadmission to hospital (within 4 days) explained most of the observed\nassociation of asthma with less severe outcomes. This is consistent with the\ninterpretation that a proportion of asthmatics, compared with nonasthmatics, were\nadmitted because of a condition triggered by viral infection\n(i.e. virus-induced asthma exacerbation) rather than\nbecause of the severity of the infection itself and for which hospital treatment was\nmore effective."}
