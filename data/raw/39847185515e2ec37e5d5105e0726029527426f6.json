{"title": "Journal Pre-proof Mitigating loss of health insurance and means tested benefits in an unconditional cash transfer experiment: Implementation lessons from Stockton's guaranteed income pilot", "body": "As the novel coronavirus threatens the health of Americans and the US economy, 2 cash transfers have received broad bipartisan support in both the House and Senate as one 3 method to address the severe financial distress brought on by the pandemic (Grisales, 4 Snell, and Davis, 2020). In March 2020, members of the Republican and Democratic 5 parties introduced cash transfers as part of a coronavirus stimulus package, illustrating 6 that the concept of cash transfers and guaranteed income (GI) programs have moved out 7 of the research space and into the policy conversation (Grunwald, 2020) . Nonetheless, to 8 date, neither the proposed stimulus package nor other GI policy proposals discuss how 9 these influxes of cash will or will not interact with means tested benefits and income 10 thresholds, leaving some households at risk of preserving their financial stability at the 11 expense of their access to health insurance and other benefits (Identifying Author). In the 12 midst of an unprecedented crisis and a surge of GI experiments, the field of public health 13 and allied disciplines are ideally situated to lead the policy community in developing 14 models that assist policy makers in ensuring that cash transfer interventions and GI 15 experiments preserve benefits rather than produce new forms of inequality. This paper 16 uses the loss mitigation strategies and ethical framework employed by the Stockton The concept of combating poverty by providing Americans with a cash transfer or 22 GI based on economic need first entered policy debates in the 1960s (Steensland, 2008) . 23\n\nRecent research demonstrating the efficacy of cash transfers in improving health equity 24 outcomes-from reductions in hospitalization rates (Forget, 2011) , obesity (Lebihan et Given the rise of the gig economy, unemployment risks posed by automation, and the 30 fluctuating nature of waged labor, income volatility-an annual income fluctuation of 31 25% or more already impacting nearly half of the US population (Pew Charitable Trusts, 32 2017)-is likely to continue influencing health outcomes, highlighting the inextricable 33 link between public health and economic stability (Standing, 2011) . In a call to the public 34 health community, Sanjay Basu (2017) identified rising income volatility as a leading 35 preventable threat to public health. GI may be one component of a larger economic 36 justice structure that could smooth this volatility, and the onus for implementation of 37 ethical and just GI models rests on public health and allied disciplines. 38\n\nPhilosophical and ethical debate about GI and its interaction with the safety net 39 dates back to the original negative income experiments of the 1960s (Harris, 2017) . 40\n\nThroughout 2019 and early 2020, Andrew Yang popularized a \"freedom dividend\", 41 providing every American citizen with a $1,000 cash transfer in his bid for the 42 Democratic presidential nomination that would make existing welfare and social program 43 beneficiaries choose between the cash transfer and benefits (Friends of Andrew Yang, 44 2020), leading to a renewed public debate on whether Yang's proposal could lead to 45 more, rather than less, inequality by depriving low-income Americans of targeted support 46 47\n\nlittle is known about how cash transfers may interact with the social safety net in the US. 48\n\nAs demonstrated through the debate around Yang's proposal and concerns around the 49 coronavirus stimulus package (Identifying Author), it is difficult to anticipate the impact 50 and related ethical concerns of unconditional cash transfer programs on benefit recipients. 51\n\nFirst, depending on recipients' circumstances, GI may contribute to the \"benefits 52 cliff,\" where a small increase in earnings can lead to a reduction in public benefits, such 53 as health insurance, food assistance, and housing support (Dinan, 2007 open-ended entitlements available to all who qualify, others are limited, in part, to 57 program funding or location (US Government Accountability Office, 2017). As a result, 58 decision-making among low-income welfare recipients involves weighing short-term and 59 long-term costs and benefits within these constraints and the availability of other formal 60 and informal resources (Edin and Lein, 1997; Roll and East, 2014; Zippay, 2002) . In 61 particular, social supports provided by informal networks, through both direct (e.g., 62\n\nfinancial contributions) and indirect (e.g., child care) mechanisms, are used by low-63 income families to \"help alleviate the stress of the cliff effect, with tangible resources and 64 reduced isolation\" (Roll and East, 2014, p. 185) . 65\n\nIn addition, eligibility and income calculations, divergent as they may be, are 66 interpreted and implemented by \"street-level bureaucrats,\" who serve as front-line 67 workers in direct service positions within agencies, lower courts, educational settings, 68 and other government entities (Lipsky, 1980) . Since street-level bureaucrats are those 69 operationalizing policy on a micro-level, they are typically the first ones to interpret and In means tested benefit programs, all clients ought to receive equivalent 77\n\ntreatment, yet they are also individuals with unique needs at the mercy of workers 78 interpreting complex rules (Lipsky, 1980) . In an implementation study of public (1) the federal coronavirus cash transfer program which would provide American tax 93 filers earning less than $75,000 ($150,000 joint return) a single payment of $1,200 per 94 individual ($2,400 joint return) and $500 per qualifying dependent, but does not specify 95 how or if this transfer would impact eligibility for existing means tested benefits 96 (Jamerson, Duehren, and Andrews, 2020); (2) proposals which seek to replace existing 97 means tested benefits with a basic GI for all Americans; and (3) the Stockton Plan, 98 described here, which seeks to provide GI alongside existing means tested benefits. 99 (i.e., at least 18 years of age with a current Stockton mailing address) were randomly 140 assigned to one of three groups: treatment (n=125), active control (i.e., participated in all 141 data collection activities; n=200), or passive control (i.e., did not participate in data 142 collection activities but consented to use of administrative data; n=150). The treatment 143 group includes five additional participants to account for medical attrition due to a pre-144 existing condition or a catastrophic medical event that would preclude ongoing 145 participation in research activities. In February 2019, the treatment group began receiving 146 the intervention, an unconditional cash transfer of $500 per month for 18 months on a 147\n\npre-paid debit card, without work requirements or spending restrictions. All research 148 methodology was approved by the [blinded for review] IRB. 149\n\nThe \"benefits cliff\" is a structural component of many existing social safety net 151 programs that effectively causes resource stagnation or reduction as participants increase 152 income (Dinan, 2007) . Thus, a critical ethical and practical consideration of 153\n\nimplementing GI alongside existing means tested benefits is the risk of existing benefit 154 reduction or disqualification. Because the purpose of SEED is testing GI alongside 155 existing safety net benefits, not in place of them, we implemented several loss mitigation 156 steps including a sampling frame without a household-level designee, onboarding of 157 potential recipients that included benefits counseling as a part of informed consent, and 158 intentional human contact between SEED staff and recipients as they navigate the 159 existing benefits structure. excusing GI from income calculations to ensure it wouldn't be counted against recipients' 212 benefits eligibility. There were, however, limits on which benefits waivers could 213\n\nAs part of informed consent, potential recipients received a comprehensive 215 overview of the potential impact of GI on other benefits. Table 1 describes benefits (i.e., 216 financial aid, food assistance, health care, housing support) potentially impacted by GI 217 and recommendations that are part of an ongoing exchange between SEED staff, local 218 partners (e.g., the San Joaquin County Human Services Agency, Housing Authority of 219 the County of San Joaquin, legal counsel) and recipients. Those at risk of experiencing 220 any benefit reduction also received a one-page cost-analysis fact sheet that detailed the 221 amount of benefits that could potentially be impacted. At this stage, five recipients opted 222 out of SEED, and other households were randomly selected from the passive control 223 group to take their place. 224\n\nFinally, in the event that recipients do experience a partial or total loss of means 225 In keeping with the project's commitment to agency and self-determination, 265 recipients also communicate regularly with the program office as to whether or not they 266 would like staff to communicate with the caseworkers managing their benefits regarding 267 the amount of money provided through the GI. Additionally, when the 18-month pilot 268 ends, staff will assist recipients who may need to re-apply for benefits, leveraging 269 existing relationships with local agencies to ensure that recipients maintain all benefits 270 for which they are eligible once they are off-boarded from the study. It is essential to consider implementation factors alongside policy to protect GI 286 recipients. As researchers seek to advance knowledge related to GI, tensions around 287 benefit loss may impact research activities that are carried out in a traditionally 288 \"distanced\" way lacking the human contact noted prior. Investigating innovative 289 solutions responsive to income volatility requires a combination of \"on the ground\" 290 engagement and self-determination where researchers make place-specific program 291 considerations, recognizing the interaction of their work within the existing benefits 292 structure. They must also engage with \"street level bureaucrats\" to understand how their 293 programs will be interpreted and treated locally (Lipsky, 2010) and, if possible, advocate 294 for waivers that will ensure no harm comes to recipients. 295\n\nUpholding recipients' ability to make informed decisions regarding their 296 participation remains crucial to this process and is mandated by the professions of public 297 health and social work (NASW, 1994 Recipient does a costanalysis of how much they will lose in SNAP, and then makes a decision to (not) move forward.\n\nHousing assistance for low-income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities either through governmentowned housing or vouchers to be used in the private market Low risk: Recipient share-of-cost does increase but is reimbursed by the Hold Harmless Fund through a partnership with the local housing authority.\n\nRecipient encouraged to participate, assuming no other benefits concerns."}
