{"title": "International mass gatherings and travel-associated illness: A GeoSentinel cross-sectional, observational study", "body": "Attendance at an international mass gathering (MG) may expose travelers to health risks related to crowded conditions, population movement, and inadequate sanitation [1, 2] . According to the World Health Organization, an event can be classified as a MG if the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state, or nation hosting the event [2] . However, much of the available literature describes mass gatherings as those exceeding 25,000 persons. We describe demographic characteristics and diagnoses among travelers who attended a MG and presented with a travel-associated illness to a GeoSentinel site. August 17, 2015 , and April 30, 2019, were collected by GeoSentinel, a global clinicianbased surveillance network that monitors travel-related illnesses among international travelers and migrants [3] . GeoSentinel was established in 1995 as a collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the International Society of Travel Medicine. It consists of 68 clinical sites in 28 countries. GeoSentinel records ill persons' visits to network sites; well travelers are not captured. Attendance at a MG is routinely recorded. During the study period, investigators were directed to enter supplemental details on the nature and location of the MG and to evaluate whether the diagnosis was likely associated with MG attendance. Records were excluded if the mass gathering was likely to have < 25,000 attendees or if data were missing regarding the type of MG. GeoSentinel's data collection protocol has been reviewed by a human subjects advisor at CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases and is classified as public health surveillance and not human subjects research. Additional ethics clearance was obtained by participating sites as required by their respective institutions or national regulations.\n\nA total of 327 records of ill travelers attending a MG during international travel had surveys completed by the investigator providing their care. Thirty-one records were excluded. Of 296 ill travelers included, 151 (51.0%) were female and the median age was 54 years (range: 1-88; IQR: 39-64). Purposes of MGs were religious (243 cases; 82.1%), cultural (e.g., music, dance, carnival) (19 cases; 6.4%), the World Scout Jamboree (17 cases; 5.7%), major sport events (13 cases; 4.4%), or a large conference (4 cases; 1.4%). The top three specific MGs were Umrah or Hajj in Saudi Arabia with 241 cases (81.4%), including 87 at Umrah and 154 at Hajj, followed by the World Scout Jamboree in Japan with 17 cases (5.7%), and the Olympics in Brazil and South Korea with 9 cases (3.1%) ( [17] [18] [19] [20] ). Sixty-four percent of ill travelers who attended Umrah or Hajj were hospitalized because of their illness; one traveler who attended the World Scout Jamboree and no travelers who attended the Olympics were hospitalized.\n\nOverall, 130 of 206 (63%) ill travelers with information available reported having a pre-travel encounter with a healthcare provider. The majority (260 of 296, 87.8%) of acquired illnesses were directly associated with MG attendance, while the relation between the illness and the MG was not ascertainable for 25 travelers (8.4%), and the illness was travel-related but not linked to MG attendance for 11 travelers (3.7%). Only three of nine (33.3%) diagnoses among travelers who attended the Olympics were associated with attending the MG.\n\nA total of 303 diagnoses were reported among the 260 ill travelers whose illness was associated with MG attendance (Table 2) . Respiratory diseases were the most frequently reported disease category with 236 diagnoses (77.9%), followed by gastrointestinal diseases (14 diagnoses; 4.6%). Diagnoses related to attendance at the three most common MGs -Umrah or Hajj, World Scout Jamboree, and Olympics -are presented in Table 1 .\n\nGeoSentinel sites evaluated 260 pilgrims with Umrah-or Hajj-related illnesses among an estimated 32 million foreign MG attendees over the study period [4] , 17 Scouts among 33,628 attendees [5] and 9 Olympic spectators among 7 million attendees [6, 7] . It should be noted, however, that GeoSentinel collects data only on ill travelers presenting to a network site and some GeoSentinel sites may care for more MG attendees than others, which may not be representative of all travelers attending a MG. In particular, the Scouts reported to GeoSentinel were from a single site in Sweden and were identified because of an international alert following a meningococcal outbreak (W ST11 serotype) among six Scottish and Swedish nationals who attended this event [8] .\n\nIll MG attendees seen at a GeoSentinel site most frequently attended Umrah or Hajj, likely due to the large number of travelers to these pilgrimages. These findings are consistent with previously published literature demonstrating that outbreaks are not frequently reported during or after MGs other than Umrah and Hajj pilgrimages, although they sometimes occur at Muslim, Christian, and Hindu religious events, sports events, and large-scale open-air festivals [9, 10] . Its size, international recognition, unique multinational component, and yearly recurrence, likely account for the preponderance of Umrah and Hajj among international MGs responsible for outbreaks. Our data are also consistent with previous reports regarding the older age of Umrah and Hajj travelers [11] , and the younger age of Scout Jamboree travelers. The finding that almost three-quarters of ill travelers who attended Umrah or Hajj were hospitalized is likely due to a recruitment bias, given that ill travelers seen at GeoSentinel sites may be sicker because of the specialized infectious disease or tertiary care nature of these sites; or to initial clinical suspicion for Middle East respiratory syndrome, resulting in hospitalization and isolation pending testing. The paucity of reported trauma is also likely a reflection of the infectious disease specialization of most GeoSentinel network sites, and of the fact that trauma usually requires immediate attention and is most likely to occur during travel [12] .\n\nThe predominance of respiratory tract infections reported in this analysis, including 4 cases of pneumococcal disease with one death, corroborates results obtained in Saudi hospitals of pneumonia diagnoses among Umrah and Hajj attendees [13] as well as the high number of influenza virus infections observed among both patients in Saudi hospitals and patients hospitalized on returning to their home countries from Umrah and Hajj [14] . Crowded conditions with close proximity of large numbers of attendees at Umrah and Hajj are a likely explanation for the frequency of respiratory infections among pilgrims, given the transmissibility of these infections. Our results confirm the importance of influenza vaccination for Umrah and Hajj travelers [15] . Although the availability of influenza vaccine may be limited depending on the time of year Hajj occurs [16] , immunization with expired influenza vaccine from the recently ended influenza season may have few associated adverse events [17] . By contrast, most illnesses among travelers attending the Olympics were linked to travel, but not to attending the Olympics, and these illnesses' were mild, which may be due to the physical separation of various sporting events at the Olympics, the propensity to hold the Olympics in high income countries, the relatively short travel duration of attendees and participants, and the relatively young age of participants. This is supported by the rarity of documented outbreaks during Olympic Games between 1984 and 2014 [9, 18] .\n\nOur identification of respiratory tract infections, especially pneumonia, among Umrah and Hajj attendees suggests the need for additional research to document responsible pathogens. Such data may have important consequences regarding vaccine recommendations before travel. In particular, it may be possible to validate that the influenza serotypes found are representative of strains circulating during the prior northern winter. These data also may provide justification for recommending pneumococcal vaccination for some high-risk travelers [19] [20] [21] . However, one-third of all travelers in this report did not attend a pre-travel consultation, and this will likely be a barrier to implementation of such recommendations. Many countries have a staging area where Umrah and Hajj attendees gather before departure, or have pre-Hajj classes at local mosques. Leaders there could raise awareness of recommended (but not required) vaccines and personal protective measures such as carrying and routinely using hand sanitizer may lead to higher level of protective behaviors of traveling pilgrims [22] . Also, primary care physicians should inquire about planned travel to mass gatherings and vaccinate travelers against meningococcus, influenza, and pneumococcus, as appropriate. Given its broad international catchment, GeoSentinel plays a role in identifying emerging infectious diseases with epidemic potential, thus contributing to efforts to create enhanced international multidisciplinary surveillance of MG-associated illnesses, as recently recommended by experts [23] . Since our surveillance was limited to patients presenting to GeoSentinel sites, to better understand travelassociated illnesses acquired at MGs improved global surveillance mechanisms are needed.\n\nGeoSentinel, the Global Surveillance Network of the International Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM), is supported by a Cooperative Agreement (U50CK00189) from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as funding from the ISTM and the Public Health Agency of Canada.
