Many countries are facing increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, which are, in their origin mostly attributed to regular international flight connections with China. This study aims to investigate this relation by analyzing available data on air traffic volume and the spread of COVID-19 cases.\n\nWe analyzed available data on current domestic and international passenger volume and flight routes and compared these to the distribution of domestic and international COVID-19 cases.\n\nOur data indicate a strong linear correlation between domestic COVID-19 cases and passenger volume for regions within China (r 2 =0.92, p=0.19) and a significant correlation between international COVID-19 cases and passenger volume (r 2 =0.98, p<0.01).\n\nThe number of flight routes as well as total passenger volume are highly relevant risk factors for the spread of current COVID-19. Multiple regions within Asia, as well as some in North America and Europe are at serious risk of constant exposure to COVID-19 from China and other highly infected countries. Risk for COVID-19 exposure remains relatively low in South America and Africa. If adequate measures are taken, including on-site disease detection and temporary passenger quarantine, limited but not terminated air traffic can be a feasible option to prevent a long-term crisis. Reasonable risk calculations and case evaluations per passenger volume are crucial aspects which must be considered when reducing international flights.\n\nThe \n\nAcquiring exact data on Chinese air traffic is challenging. Currently, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has partially restricted access to information on passenger volume, destinations and locations. At the same time, only a few studies have focused on international connection of the Chinese aviation market 6, 7 . Restricted access to current data therefore requires analysis of available data and studies on the Chinese aviation market and other countries. \n\nThe total number of annual domestic Chinese passengers from 2013 to 2018 were sourced from the publicly available annual civil aviation industry databases of CAAC.\n\nAs the 2018 number of domestic passengers for each economic region in China is not publicly available, we estimated this data from the 2018 passenger throughput and total numbers of annual domestic passengers (see figure 1 ). We determined that the total number of passenger throughput was significantly correlated to the total amount of annual \n\nAnalysis was based on the publicly available data for Chinese international air traffic from \n\nThe total number of annual international passengers in China from 2011 to 2016 were sourced from publicly available annual civil aviation industry databases of the CAAC.\n\nSince international passenger numbers for each region in China in 2016 were not made publicly available, we estimated this data from the number of international routes from and to China and the total amount of annual international passengers in China in 2016.\n\nWe determined that the total number of international routes in China was highly correlated to the total annual international passengers from 2011 to 2016 \n\nThe total number confirmed cases of COVID-19 for regions in China and internationally were sourced from the COVID-19 situation reports made publicly available by the WHO.\n\nAnalysis included data until up February 5 th , 2020.\n\nWe \n\nIn the past two decades, domestic and international flights have increased in China, which is also reflected by the increasing passenger volume. According to data from the CAAC, \n\nOn the domestic front, data analysis reveals that when comparing the passenger traffic in China by region and total case numbers, a correlation can be assumed (r 2 =0.92 and p <0.19) (doted line, figure 5 ). The COVID-19 cases are much higher per passenger number than on the international scale. Although these numbers are relatively lower per passenger, this correlation is highly significant (r 2 =0.98 with a p<0.01 ( figure 5) ).\n\nWith the current COVID-19 crisis being a global pandemic, some aspects are especially We must emphasize that this rational focuses on the initial stages of COVID-19 spread.\n\nPopulation size, custom controls as well as the increasingly implemented control measures may affect the scale and behavior of further virus spread. Additionally, it is quite likely that domestic flight routes in China have also been frequented by international travelers who may have also combined domestic air-travel with other transportation modalities e.g.\n\ncruises, trains and others. These aspects may have also impacted the data.\n\nBetween January 27 th and 30 th , we observe major international flight restrictions to China.\n\nAt the same time, an explosion of case numbers within new epicenters is detected which has given further rise to international virus spread, affecting Italy and Iran in particular.\n\nNewly diagnosed COVID-19 cases with potential travel history to China have most likely become negligible -yet incalculable -because of persisting travel restrictions to China and the development of new epicenters with continuous international flight routes. Therefore, continuous flight services from these secondary epicenters have presumably played a major role in COVID-19 spread.\n\nAir travel is a major facilitator in the international distribution of COVID- \n\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.\n\nThe authors did not receive any funding for this study.
