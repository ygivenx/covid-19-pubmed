{"title": "[ 18 F]-and [ 11 C]-Labeled N-benzyl-isatin sulfonamide analogues as PET tracers for apoptosis: synthesis, radiolabeling mechanism, and in vivo imaging of apoptosis in Fas-treated mice NIH Public Access Author Manuscript", "body": "\"Molecular imaging is the visualization, characterization and measurement of biological processes at the molecular and cellular levels in humans and other living systems.\" 1 Positron emission tomography (PET), one of the in vivo imaging techniques used in molecular imaging, is being used more frequently in clinical and research fields because of its high sensitivity, minimal physiological effect from PET tracers, good spatial resolution and ease of accurate quantification. One important application of molecular imaging is to study programmed cell death (apoptosis) at the molecular level. Apoptosis is critical for the normal development and function of multicellular organisms as a common and universal mechanism of cell death. 2 The abnormal regulation of cellular death via apoptosis is believed to play a key role in a variety of human diseases. 3 In addition, the beneficial effect of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and other antitumor therapies can be attributed to their activation of the apoptotic process. 4 Therefore, the development of a noninvasive imaging procedure that can study the process of apoptosis in a variety of disease states and monitor the ability of a drug or other treatment either to induce or to halt apoptosis would be of tremendous value to the research and clinical community.\n\nOne of the most commonly used agents so far for imaging apoptosis in vivo is based on Annexin V, which is a 36 kDa protein that binds selectively with high affinity to phosphatidylserine, a protein that is externalized in the early stages of apoptosis after the activation of caspase-3. Annexin V has been labeled with different radioisotopes for PET and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies. 5 99m Tc-labeled Annexin V using SPECT showed promising results and is undergoing clinical trials. 6 However, since the externalization of phosphatidylserine also occurs in necrosis, radiolabeled Annexin V is not specific for imaging apoptosis in vivo. An alternative strategy for visualizing cells and tissues undergoing apoptosis is the use of peptides or small molecules directed toward enzymes that are intrinsic to the biochemical pathways of apoptosis. The enzymes responsible for the regulation and execution of apoptosis are the caspases, which exist as inactive zymogens (pro-caspases) in the cytosol and become activated when cells receive an apoptotic signal. Caspases activated early in the process of apoptosis are known as initiator caspases, such as caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10. The function of the initiator caspases is to activate the executioner caspases, caspase-3, -6, and -7, which are responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of proteins that are necessary for cellular function. Cellular apoptosis can be initiated via two different pathways, extrinsic and intrinsic. 7 Since both pathways converge at the level of caspase-3 activation, immunohistochemical staining for activated caspase-3 provides an unambiguous marker for apoptosis.\n\nA number of isatin (1) sulfonamide analogues have been reported to have high inhibition potency for the executioner caspases, caspase-3 and -7, and high selectivity against other caspases. 8 One of these isatin sulfonamide analogues, 1-[4-(2-fluoroethoxy)-benzyl]-5-(2phenoxymethyl-pyrrolidine-1-sulfonyl)-1H-indole-2,3-dione, 2 (WC-II-89) , has been labeled with 18 F and evaluated in biodistribution studies with the cycloheximide liver injury model in rats, a well-established murine model of chemically-induced apoptosis. The biodistribution studies of [ 18 F]2 revealed higher uptake in the liver and spleen in cycloheximide-treated rats when compared with untreated control rats. We also reported the first microPET imaging study directly measuring caspase-3 activation in tissues undergoing apoptosis using [ 18 F]2 as a PET radiotracer. 9 Given the central importance of apoptosis in a variety of disease states as well as in new drug development, the development of [ 18 F]2 as a promising radiotracer for PET imaging of apoptosis is significant in studying apoptosis in vivo.\n\nThe requisite radiolabeling reactions usually take place via the nucleophilic substitution of a good leaving group such as mesylate, tosylate or triflate under basic conditions for 18 F labeling 10 or methylation using [ 11 C]CH 3 I in the presence of a base for 11 C labeling. 11 These labeling reactions are very different from the normal chemical synthesis: the half lives of 18 F (t 1/2 = 110 min) and 11 C (t 1/2 = 20.4 min) are short, limiting the reaction time; therefore, fast reaction times and simple procedures are required. Secondly, only tracer amounts of radioactive isotopes, such as [ 18 F]fluoride and [ 11 C]CH 3 I, are present to react with a large excess of substrate. The labeling reaction can benefit from the large amount of substrate to increase the rate of the reaction, but at the same time, any amount of reactive impurities or other reactive functional groups in the substrate might react with [ 18 F]fluoride or [ 11 C]CH 3 I, generating side-products, or slowing down or even stopping the desired radiolabeling reaction. A variety of reactions can take place on the isatin ring in the isatin analogues. 12 One such reaction is the nucleophilic attack on the C3 carbonyl carbon of the isatin ring, the \"warhead group\" that is crucial to the inhibition of caspase-3 by isatin sulfonamide analogues. 13 Although isatin sulfonamide analogues exhibit very good potency for inhibiting caspase-3, the preparation of radiolabeled isatin sulfonamide analogues with 18 F or 11 C for PET imaging was limited because of the difficulty of radiolabeling with 18 F or 11 C using the standard methods. 14 In order to improve the synthesis of such compounds, we sought a better understanding of the radiolabeling reaction, and examined the mechanism through both experimental and modeling studies. Furthermore, related isatin derivatives have been reported as drug candidates for their inhibition of SARS Coronavirus 3C-like Protease, 15 GSK-3 protease, 16 carboxylesterases, 17 HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. 18 They have also exhibited cytotoxicity to the cancer cells in vitro. 19 This study could provide a useful method to synthesize isatin derivative radiotracers for both PET and SPECT studies. Here we report the radiolabeling reactions of N-benzyl-isatin sulfonamide analogues with 18 F and 11 C, the mechanism and modeling studies of the labeling reactions, and evaluation of the 11 C compound in an in vivo microPET imaging study with the Fas liver injury model in mice.\n\nThe syntheses of standard compounds 2, 4 and precursors 7a, 7b and 12 for 18 F labeling of 2 and 8, and 13 for 11 C labeling of 4, are shown in Scheme 1. The isatin nitrogen of 5-(2phenoxymethyl-pyrrolidine-sulfonyl)-1H-2,3-dione 3 was alkylated by treatment of 3 with sodium hydride in DMF at 0 \u00b0C for 20 min and followed by addition of various alkyl halides to give compounds 2, 4, 5, and 6 respectively. Compound 5 was then heated to reflux with silver methanesulfonate or silver p-toluenesulfonate in CH 3 CN to generate precursors 7a or 7b. Precursor 8 was prepared by hydrolysis of 6 with sodium hydroxide in aqueous methanol. For the synthesis of precursors 12 and 13, the C3 carbonyl group in 3 was first protected as 1,3-dioxane by refluxing 3 and 1,3-propanediol in benzene using ptoluenesulfonic acid as a catalyst to give 9, which was then alkylated with 4bromoethyloxybenzyl bromide or 4-acetoxybenzyl chloride to give compounds 10 or 11 respectively. Then precursors 12 and 13 were prepared with the same procedure as for 7a and 8.\n\nThe methods for synthesis of [ 18 F]2 are summarized in scheme 2. First, precursor 7a or 7b was converted completely to the isatinate salt by treatment with strong base such as Bu 4 NOH or K 2 CO 3 /Kryptofix 222 (K 222 ) in order to avoid the trapping effect due to the C3 carbonyl group in isatin; then the nucleophilic substitution reaction took place under standard labeling condition to replace the mesylate or tosylate groups affording the 18 F labeled isatinate salt of 2 in high yield, which was then converted quickly to [ 18 F]2 in high yield with 1N HCl under microwave irradiation. [ 18 F]2 was confirmed by reverse phase HPLC co-eluting with non-radioactive standard 2. The synthesis time is 90 min, the labeling yield is high, the chemical and radiochemical purities are good and the specific activity is high (2600 \u00b1 1276 mCi/mmol, n = 15). Alternatively, [ 18 F]2 was synthesized from the C3 carbonyl-protected mesylate precursor 12, followed by hydrolysis of 14 using 1 N HCl. In a similar manner, [ 11 C]4 was synthesized as shown in scheme 3. All of these reactions provide [ 18 F]2 and [ 11 C]4, with high yield and high specific activity suitable for use in a molecular imaging study of apoptosis.\n\nThe typical procedure for 18 20 However, the labeling reaction of mesylate precursor 7a using the standard method afforded either no labeling products or a more polar product in low yield according to TLC or HPLC analysis. Interestingly, if precursor 7a was first treated with 2 equivalent of dried Bu 4 NOH, then the labeling reaction took place efficiently to form a more polar product in high yields, which could then be converted to the desired product [ 18 F]2 gradually at room temperature or quickly at elevated temperature under acidic conditions. These results suggest that the [ 18 F]fluoride cannot displace the mesylate group directly in 7a, but it does displace the mesylate group from an intermediate formed under basic conditions. A proposed mechanism for this observation in the 18 F labeling reaction of 2 is shown in scheme 4.\n\nIn terms of nucleophilic addition on the isatin ring, nucleophiles such as H 2 O, OH \u2212 or F \u2212 can add to the C3 carbonyl carbon easily to form the corresponding species in a reversible reaction. However, the OH \u2212 group can also attack the C2 carbonyl carbon resulting in the opening of the isatin ring and this reaction is irreversible under basic conditions. Therefore, the isatin might exist in different forms in solution, such as the reversible hydrated form, 18, and the irreversible ring-opened form, 16, depending on the pH of the solution and the solvent used. Isatin-5-sulfonate itself was reported to exist as an isatin and a hydrated form in 3-4:1 ratio by NMR. 21 In aqueous solution, the hydrate form is suggested by HPLC peak fronting observed in reversed phase C18 HPLC chromatography using CH 3 CN and water (pH = 7 or 4) as solvents. The peak fronting should be due to the equilibrium of isatin and its more polar hydrated form, resulting from the interaction with water in the HPLC solvents. This peak fronting can be suppressed by addition of methanol to the HPLC solvent system. The formation of the hydrated form corroborates the high electrophilicity of the isatin ring at the C3 carbon. In the case of 18 \n\nIn order to distinguish which intermediate, 16 or 18, was involved in the following labeling reaction, a 13 C NMR study was carried out on samples of 7a, under the conditions simulating the labeling reaction. The 13 C chemical shift of the C3 carbonyl carbon should be around 90 ppm for the hydrated form 18 and 200 ppm for the ring-opening form 16. 21 In DMSO, once precursor 7a was treated with 1 or 2 equivalent of 1 M Bu 4 NOH in water, a clean formation of the ring-opened product isatinate 16 was observed based on the observation that a new set of 13 C NMR peaks formed with the complete disappearance of those of 7a and that the chemical shift for C3 carbonyl carbon is shifted from 181.5 ppm for 7a to 200.6 ppm, which is the chemical shift expected for the ring-opened isatinate form 16. The 13 C NMR peaks (around 90 ppm) of the C3 carbonyl carbon for the hydrated form 18 were not observed. (For example, the C3 of 12 is at 93.3 ppm). Similarly, the C3 of Nbenzyl isatin 21, which was used for the modeling study, shifts from 183.1 ppm to 201.0 ppm in its ring-opened isatinate form 22 (supporting information Figure S7 -S14). Therefore, intermediate 18 is not likely to be involved in the labeling reaction and it should be the ringopened isatinate form 16 that is the species being labeled. We also attempted to study the formation of the fluoride adduct with 21 by 13 C and 19 F NMR. The 13 C NMR study of a reaction mixture, 21 and Bu 4 NF in DMSO, indicated the gradual formation of isatinate, and this should be due to the unavoidable OH \u2212 /H 2 O in Bu 4 NF solution. By comparison with a control reaction, in which no 21 was added, the signal-to-noise ratio in 19 F NMR of Bu 4 NF was reduced after addition of 21. This observation indicated that there is a fast exchange of fluoride with isatin and the observation supports our assumption that [ 18 F]fluoride is trapped by the isatin C3 carbonyl group instead of substituting the mesylate group during the 18 F labeling of 2 under standard conditions (supporting information Figure S5 -S6).\n\nIn order to evaluate the electrophilicity of isatin and their isatinates, DFT calculations were performed using G98 22 in order to compare the reactivity of the C3 carbon towards nucleophilic attack. Calculations were carried out on the simplified isatin precursor 21 and its analogues to obtain the nucleophilic reactivity Fukui function (FF). 23 The frontier electron theory or Fukui function has been widely used as a local density functional descriptors to model chemical reactivity and site selectivity. The atom with the highest FF is highly reactive compared to the other atoms in the molecule. As confirmed by the theoretical calculations, the C3 carbon of the simplified precursor 21 has the highest electrophilicity (FF=0.24) in the molecule before the isatin ring opens; while its electrophilicity is lowered tremendously once it was converted into its isatinate form 22 (FF=0.04). Its reactivity also decreases considerably in the hydrate form 23 (FF=0.12), while the reactivity of the carbon attached to the mesylate group (C-OMs) undergoes no change. This is in good agreement with the proposed radiolabeling mechanism.\n\nOnce the labeling mechanism was elucidated, the amount of K 2 CO 3 used in the labeling reaction and the effect of water to the reaction yield were studied. When only K 2 CO 3 was used in the labeling reaction, it was found that about 2 mg of K 2 CO 3 was needed in order to obtain high yield of the labeling product (Table 2, entry 4). When less than 1 mg of K 2 CO 3 was used, there was no incorporation after initial microwave irradiation, and only after more K 2 CO 3 /K 222 in DMSO was added, the yield increased to a comparable value as when 2 mg K 2 CO 3 used (table 1, entry 3). When [ 18 F]fluoride in the presence of K 222 and K 2 CO 3 was dried very carefully, the yield was low. This is understandable because K 2 CO 3 /K 222 is a weaker base than Bu 4 NOH and it doesn't provide OH \u2212 in the absence of water to open the isatin ring. Therefore, if K 2 CO 3 was used as a base in the labeling reaction, it needs a longer reaction time and a trace amount of H 2 O to open the isatin ring completely in order to avoid the trapping effect from the C3 carbonyl group. Normally, water should be excluded in the labeling reaction because water can solvate [ 18 F]fluoride, reducing its nucleophilicity, lowering its reactivity and resulting in the failure of the nucleophilic substitution. An example is when the isatin precursor was treated with wet Bu 4 NOH, a very low yield of labeling product was obtained (table 1, entry 2) in comparison to the precursor treated with dry Bu 4 NOH (table 1, entry 1). Therefore, the labeling reaction conditions were optimized by using a large amount of K 2 CO 3 to open the isatin ring completely, and to also consume trace amounts of water left during the drying of [ 18 Hydrolysis of isatin and N-methyl isatin and recyclization of isatinates have been studied, 24 but the study of other N-substituted isatins is quite limited. The stability of N-benzylisatins towards base hydrolysis is expected to be better than that of isatin or N-methyl isatin because of the steric protection from the benzyl substitute on the nitrogen atom in the isatin ring. This stability enables N-benzyl-isatinsulfonamide analogues to function as potential tracers for imaging caspases-3/7 activity in vivo. The hydrolysis of N-benzylisatinsulfonamides was studied by reversed phase HPLC and ESI/MS. According to HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture, Bu 4 NOH can hydrolyze isatin analogues to form isatinates exclusively and quickly; the hydrolysis by K 2 CO 3 /K 222 was quick, but the hydrolysis by NaHCO 3 /H 2 O was slow and in neutral solution the analogues were very stable. Once the isatinates were treated with 1N HCl, they were converted back to isatin analogues gradually at room temperature or quickly under heating or microwave irradiation. The base hydrolyzed isatin analogues and acid recyclized isatinates were purified by reversed phase HPLC and the HPLC purified products were further analyzed by ESI/MS. Molecular ion plus H 2 O was observed as the major peak for the hydrolyzed product in ESI/MS, together with the 13 C NMR study, indicating the formation of isatinate; The formation of isatin analogues from acid recyclization of isatinates was confirmed by comparison of the retention time in HPLC and MS spectrum with the corresponding isatin analogues (supporting information Figure  S3 , S4).\n\nFor the classic alkylation of hydroxyl or nitrogen groups, NaH is commonly used as a base to deprotonate, and it was used in the N-alkylation of 3 during the synthesis of standard and precursor N-benzylisatin sulfonamides. However, in the 11 C methylation of 8 by [ 11 C]CH 3 I, where excess of NaH was used, the 11 C labeling of 8 failed to afford the expected radiolabeled product [ 11 C]4, but led to the formation of numerous polar radioactive peaks as observed by reverse phase HPLC. To circumvent this problem, the ketal precursor 13 was prepared and in the presence of NaH, 13 was labeled with [ 11 C]CH 3 I in DMF or CH 3 CN under standard conditions to afford 15. However, it was difficult to remove the dioxolane protecting group of 15 with 1 N HCl even under microwave irradiation, the condition which was used to remove the protecting group in 14 for the 18 F labeling of 2. A 6 N HCl solution was needed to remove the dioxolane group in 15, and this harsh hydrolysis condition caused the labeling results to be inconsistent in terms of radiochemical yield and specific activity ( Table 3 ).\n\nThe ring-opening and reclosure method used in the 18 F labeling of 2 was also used in the 11 C labeling of 4. 2 equivalent of Bu 4 OH in H 2 O was used to treat as low as 0.2 mg substrate 8, opening the isatin ring exclusively and quickly, then the O-methylation took place under the standard condition to afford the 11 C labeled isatinate intermediate, which was converted to [ 11 C]4 by the treatment with 1 N HCl. This method is simple, the yield is very high, and the chemical and radiochemical purities are very good (table 3) . Therefore, the ring-opening/reclosure method can also be used in the 11 C methylation labeling reaction of isatin analogues with very good labeling results.\n\nOnce the radiolabeling conditions were established, [ 11 C]4 (WC-98) was evaluated in a well-characterized mouse model of liver apoptosis induced by administration of anti-Fas (Jo2) antibody, which results in massive caspase-3 activation in the liver. Both microPET imaging and biodistribution studies were performed. 25 The microPET imaging results are shown in Figure 1 . There is clearly retained activity in the liver in the Fas-treated mice compared to the control, with retention of the activity in the liver demonstrated on timeactivity curves ( Figure 1 ). The ex vivo analysis of the liver is illustrated in Figure 2 . At 5 min, there is no difference in liver uptake between treated and control mice; however, at 30 min, there is clearly increased tracer activity in the liver samples taken from the treated mice compared with controls. Liver samples from the biodistribution study were taken and analyzed for caspase-3 activation by fluorometric enzyme analysis using the caspase-3 fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC (Biomol) (Figure 3 ). Enzyme analysis verified increased caspase-3 enzymatic activity in the treated animals and correlated with the findings from the microPET imaging and biodistribution studies. Since [ 11 C]4 (WC-98) is a competitive inhibitor of caspase-3 and binds to the activated form of caspase-3 in tissues undergoing apoptosis, we see expected retention of the tracer in the liver of the treated mice. The results obtained with [ 18 F]4 suggest again that radiolabeled N-benzyl-isatin sulfonamide analogues are potential radiotracers for imaging caspase-3 activity in vivo.\n\nWe have demonstrated that 11 C-and 18 F-labeled isatin analogues can be synthesized by using the base/acid ring-opening/recyclization procedure or by protecting the C-3 carbonyl group as a 1,3-dioxane. It was found that the high electrophilicity of the C-3 carbonyl group in the isatin ring served as a trap for [ 18 F]fluoride, resulting in the failure of 18 F radiolabeling under typical conditions. Therefore, the protection of the C-3 carbonyl carbon in isatin analogues is critical to avoid unwanted nucleophilic attacks during the synthesis, and the base/acid ring-opening/recyclization procedure was proved to be a highly efficient method for this purpose. Utilizing this method, we have synthesized 18 F and 11 C labeled isatin analogues with high chemical and radiochemical purities. In vivo evaluation of [ 11 C]4 (WC-98) in the Fas liver injury apoptosis model demonstrated increased uptake of the tracer in treated animals, with verification of caspase-3 activation by fluorometric caspase-3 enzymatic assay. The correlation of retaining tracer and caspase-3 enzyme activity in the liver of treated mice indicates that [ 11 C]4 (WC-98), a benzyl-isatin sulfonamide analogue caspase-3 inhibitor, is a potential radiotracer for imaging caspases3/7 activation in apoptosis. The method described in the paper should be applicable to the radiolabeling of other isatin analogues.\n\nAll chemicals were obtained from standard commercial sources and used without further purification.

The reaction mixture was diluted in water (40 mL) and this solution was passed through a Waters Oasis HLB cartridge to trap the product. After the product was eluted with CH 3 CN (10 mL) from the Oasis cartridge, it was condensed to almost dryness under reduced pressure and reconditioned in CH 3 CN (0.8 mL), MeOH (1.2 mL) and water (2 mL) for HPLC injection. The HPLC purification and final workup are the same as above.\n\nOptimized method-100 mCi [ 18 F]fluoride in 0.02 M K 2 CO 3 solution (ca 200 \u00b5L) was dried in a 10 mL Pyrex tube with K 222 (10 mg) and K 2 CO 3 (1.8 mg) by azeotropic distillation at 110 \u00b0C under a gentle stream of nitrogen with successive addition of three aliquots (1.0 mL) of CH 3 CN, then a solution of 7a (1.1 mg, 1.8 \u00b5mol) in anhydrous DMSO (600 \u00b5L) was added inside the tube, which was capped firmly afterwards. The reaction mixture was shaken well by hand (The purpose is to open the isatin ring. At this point, the solution color changed lighter to pale yellow) and was heated by microwave (60W) for 30 and 25 sec with an interval of 1 min between the irradiations. Then 1 N HCl (500 \u00b5L) was added and the mixture in the capped tube was heated by microwave (60W) for 25 sec. The reaction mixture was diluted in water (40 mL) and this solution was passed through a Waters classic C18 Sep-Pak cartridge to trap the product, which was eluted by back-flushing with CH 3 CN (1.0 mL), MeOH (1.0 mL) and water (2.0 mL) for HPLC injection. The purification was carried out by a semipreparative HPLC (Alltech Econosil C18 250 \u00d7 10 mm 10\u00b5m) eluting with 24% CH 3 CN, 44% methanol and 32% 0.1 M ammonium formate buffer (pH=4.5) at a flow rate of 4 mL/min and UV at 251 nm. The radioactive peak corresponding to [ 18 F]2 was detected at 20 to 23 min according to the radioactivity detector and was collected (0.5 min per tube). The majority of the collected activity (mainly in 4 tubes) was diluted in water (30 mL), then a Waters C18 classic Sep-Pak was used to extract the activity and the Sep-Pak was washed with water (10 mL) to remove any trace of CH 3 CN. [ 18 F]2 was eluted by back-flushing with ethanol in a portion of 0.5mL (< 2 mL total). The portions contain the majority of the activity (in ca 1 mL) was used for final dose preparation. The total synthesis time is 90 min.\n\nRadiochemical Purity and Specific Activity-The radiochemical purity of [ 18 F]2 was determined by analytical HPLC column (Alltech Altima C18 250 \u00d7 4.6 mm 10\u00b5m) eluting with 76% methanol and 24% water at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min and UV at 251 nm. [ 18 F]2 was eluted at 5.8 min and confirmed by the coelution with nonradioactive standard 2 on the analytical HPLC system. By comparison of the integrated sample UV signal with a calibrated compound mass/UV absorbance curve, the specific activity was determined as at the end of synthesis. The radiochemical purity is > 99%.\n\nGeneral procedure for 11 Radiochemical Purity and Specific Activity of [ 11 C]4-The above method in [ 18 F]2 was used to determine the radiochemical purity and specific activity under the following conditions: Alltech Altima C18 250 \u00d7 4.6 mm 10\u00b5m column; 75 % MeOH, 25% 0.1 M ammonium formate buffer (pH = 4.5) at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min and UV at 251 nm; retention time of [ 11 C]4 is 6.5 min.\n\n, and 23 were built by hand and optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G* level in Gaussian98. Following the method of Thanikaivelan, 23 the CHELPG method was utilized to assign the electron populations used for the Fukui analysis.\n\nFemale Balb/c mice (19.3 \u00b1 1 g) were injected intravenously with anti-Fas (Jo2) antibody (10 \u00b5g) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), then injected with [ 11 C]4 90 min later. For the microPET imaging study, 60 min of imaging were acquired dynamically after obtaining a transmission scan for attenuation correction. Regions of interest were drawn over the left lobe of the liver to avoid spillover activity from the gallbladder. For the biodistribution study, animals were sacrificed at 5 min and 30 min after tracer injection, the liver was removed, weighed, and counted in a Beckman Gamma 6000 counter. The percent injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) was presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation.\n\nProtein was extracted from liver samples obtained from the biodistribution study according to a previously published protocol. 26 Protein (200 \u00b5g) were loaded in triplicate into a 96well plate with Ac-DEVD-AMC substrate (20 \u00b5M) (Biomol International, LP, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and with or without the caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (1 \u00b5M) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in assay buffer. The plate was read every 15 min for 4 h on a Victor 3 V microplate reader (Model 1420, Perkin-Elmer, Fremont, CA). Background fluorescence was subtracted from each time point, and readings were plotted over time. Linear regression was performed on the linear portion of the curve (within 2 h of reading) to determine the slope, which is the rate of caspase-3 enzyme activity.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material. MicroPET imaging with [ 11 C]4 (WC-98). Images were acquired dynamically over 60 min and summed. Single slice coronal summed images demonstrate increased retention of [ 11 C]4 (WC-98) in the treated animal, which is confirmed by time activity curves generated from a volume of interest (in green) placed over the liver. Gallbladder (GB) activity is marked by yellow arrows. Ex vivo evaluation of [ 11 C]4 (WC-98) uptake in liver comparing mice treated with the Fas antibody to untreated controls. Error bars indicate the standard deviation. There is increased uptake of [ 11 C]4 (WC-98) at 30 min in the treated group. N=3 in each group at 5 min, N=5 in each group at 30 min. "}
