{"title": "STING: infection, inflammation and cancer", "body": "STING promotes immunity to DNA viruses and retroviruses. Many DNA viruses have been reported to trigger STING-dependent activity, including adenovirus, vaccinia virus and papilloma virus2,28,29,30,31. The importance of the cGAS\u2013STING axis has also been demonstrated for retrovirus infection including HIV32,33,34,35. It is probable that retroviral DNA activates the cGAS\u2013STING axis, although a recent report indicated that retroviral RNA\u2013DNA hybrids can also trigger this pathway suggesting that a wide array of nucleic acid structures may be capable of triggering STING activity32,33,36,37,38. CDNs may also be packaged within viruses to directly stimulate STING antiviral signalling39,40.\n\nRecently, endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) have been reported to have a role in stimulating T cell-independent B cell activity in response to exposure to bacterial capsular polysaccharides or viral capsids41. This B cell response resulted from activation of both retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and STING signalling pathways by reactivated ERVs. It remains unclear how the genomes of DNA viruses, such as HIV and HSV1, trigger STING signalling, since the capsids are thought to deliver the viral genome to the nucleus through the nuclear pore33; however, it is plausible that the viral nucleic acids may be exposed from the protective capsids soon after entry into the cell or at the nuclear pore. It is also possible that some DNA viruses, such as polyomavirus, replicate in the ER where STING resides42, which may help hide the viral genome from cytosolic or nuclear sensors, such as cGAS. It thus remains to be fully determined how STING signalling is triggered through cGAS by pathogen-associated DNA in the cell.\n\nSTING suppresses replication of RNA viruses. It became evident soon after its discovery that STING is also required for host protection against a number of RNA-related pathogens, including vesicular stomatitis virus, Sendai virus and possibly dengue virus1,2,43. However, synthetic RNA, such as polyinosinic\u2013polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), or RNA viruses do not trigger STING-related autophagy or the innate immune signalling events that usually result in gene induction1,2. Thus, the mechanisms by which STING thwarts gene replication of positive- and negative-sense viruses needs to be clarified. It is possible that STING exerts this effect through its translocon function, conceivably by regulating translation of viral RNA or even autophagy.\n\nThe synthase cGAS has also been shown to play a part in host defence against RNA virus infection, although the mechanisms remain to be clarified. For example, ablation of this enzyme rendered RNA virus-infected cells sensitive to viral replication, even though RNA species do not trigger cGAS activity or the generation of CDNs44,45. It is therefore possible that STING may have evolved two disparate host defence-related functions depending on whether the invading pathogen possessed an RNA or DNA genome. DNA viruses may trigger potent STING-activated gene induction, whereas RNA virus replication may be thwarted at the level of translation or post-translation. Alternatively, it is possible that STING signalling may be responsible for constitutively generating low levels of type I IFNs that are required for the robust activation of RNA-sensing pathways following viral infection. Perhaps unsurprisingly, some recent studies have reported that some viruses can suppress STING function. For example, the non-structural protein 2B (NS2B)\u2013NS3 protease complex of dengue virus has been shown to cleave human STING, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus reportedly inhibits the ability of STING to activate IRF3 (Ref. 46). Furthermore, adenovirus and HSV1 as well as other viruses have similarly been described to control STING function1,2,47,48,49.\n\nThe STING pathway and bacteria. Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria have also been reported to promote STING signalling1,2. For example, L. monocytogenes does this by secreting STING-activating CDNs (that is, c-di-AMP), although the genomes of bacteria have also been shown to be capable of stimulating STING function1,2,3,4,10. Type I IFN production has now been shown to be triggered through the STING pathway by several bacteria including Legionella pneumophila, Francisella tularensis, Chlamydia muridarum, Streptococcus pyogenes, Brucella abortus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis50,51,52,53,54,55.\n\nAlthough the activation of innate immune genes through STING signalling may help prevent dangerous bacterial infection (Fig. 2), in certain situations STING-mediated innate immune gene induction surprisingly appears to facilitate bacterial survival. For example, L. monocytogenes and M. tuberculosis may activate STING to downregulate cell-mediated immunity and host defence responses55. Patients with severe tuberculosis are known to present with high IFN levels, which correspond to disease severity. Plausibly, type I IFN-induced genes may comprise cytokines that suppress adaptive immune responses, perhaps in an effort to control inflammation. Of note, mice deficient for both the TLR adaptor molecule MYD88 and STING retained the ability to mount adaptive immune responses to L. monocytogenes, suggesting that alternative sensing pathways can recognize bacterial infection and trigger adaptive immunity in the absence of STING55. This could involve activation of the RIG-I-like pathway by bacterial RNAs.\n\nThese studies highlight the delicate equilibrium between an appropriate immune response and inflammation, a balance that has perhaps been exploited by microorganisms. Such findings may have important implications in the development of STING-targeting adjuvants and the design of vaccines intended to induce robust, long-lasting adaptive immune responses (Fig. 2).\n\nAlthough transient inflammatory responses are essential for initiating host defence responses to pathogen invasion, sustained or chronic inflammatory signalling is a key factor in the development of autoimmune disease. Over 20% of individuals in the United States alone will suffer some form of inflammatory disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), SLE or inflammatory bowel disease56. In almost all cases, the aetiology of such diseases remains unknown. What is known is that patients with complex inflammation-related disorders, such as RA and SLE, exhibit high levels of antinuclear antibody (ANA), DNA and even nucleosomes in the blood, as well as high levels of circulating cytokines57. Self-DNA, probably from necrotic or inappropriately apoptosed cells, has therefore been implicated in the pathogenesis of these types of disease, with aberrant innate immune signalling being caused by a failure to distinguish between self and foreign nucleic acid58.\n\nThe inability to efficiently eliminate self-DNA that could inadvertently trigger immune responses may also be a key factor in facilitating inflammatory disease. For example, a number of animal models with defects in DNases exhibit lethal inflammatory disorders. In some instances, DNase-related defects have been found in humans with comparable disease57. Defects in DNASE1, for example, have been implicated in autoimmune disorders in humans and mice59. Furthermore, mice with defects in the lysosomal DNA endonuclease Dnase2, which is essential for degrading DNA from apoptotic cells engulfed by phagocytes, die before birth owing to the toxic effects of type I IFN overproduction57. However, Dnase2\u2212/\u2212 mice are viable when crossed with mice deficient for STING (Tmem173\u2212/\u2212 mice), as the production of apoptotic DNA-driven cytokine production by phagocytes is almost completely eliminated20. Mice defective in three-prime repair exonuclease 1 (Trex1; also known as Dnase3) similarly exhibit significant cytokine overproduction and inflammation and, importantly, TREX1-related mutations with concomitant disease have been reported in humans60. This indicates that STING signalling is responsible for the production of harmful pro-inflammatory cytokines generated by self-DNA derived from necrotic or inappropriately apoptosed cells. Such DNases almost certainly help ensure that apoptotic cells remain 'immunologically silent' following phagocytosis.\n\nSTING-dependent signalling was also found to be the cause of inflammation-aggravated lethality in Trex1\u2212/\u2212 mice61,62. TREX1 is a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 DNA exonuclease that degrades single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and dsDNA substrates. Trex1\u2212/\u2212 mice are viable but have a median lifespan of approximately 10 weeks owing, in part, to the development of inflammatory myocarditis63. Patients with severe SLE and AGS have been found to have mutations in TREX1, suggesting that defects in this protein are responsible for these diseases, possibly through the inability of phagocytes to degrade self-DNA60. Such patients typically die at a young age. However, Trex1\u2212/\u2212Tmem173\u2212/\u2212 double knockout mice were relatively disease free, exhibiting reduced cytokine levels, reduced ANA levels and no signs of inflammatory myocarditis or early death62. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) or bone marrow- derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from Trex1\u2212/\u2212 mice, but not from Trex1\u2212/\u2212Tmem173\u2212/\u2212 mice, were found to produce high levels of inflammatory cytokines in the absence of any notable infection5,62,64. Furthermore, the adoptive transfer of wild-type bone marrow to irradiated Trex1\u2212/\u2212 mice rescued mortality62. Thus, STING-dependent inflammatory cytokines produced by immune cells probably have an important role in TREX1-mediated inflammatory disease65 (Fig. 3).\n\nHowever, it has been reported that Trex1\u2212/\u2212 cells display a defect in the transition from G1 phase to S phase of the cell cycle and also accumulate DNA species in the cytoplasm63. BMDCs from Trex1\u2212/\u2212 mice in G2 arrest exhibited increased levels of cytokine expression compared with BMDCs from wild-type mice, suggesting that TREX1 may have a housekeeping role in eliminating aberrant self-DNA species that may accrue in the cytoplasm after genome replication62,63. These nucleic acids may intrinsically activate cytokine production through activation of cGAS and STING. A further report indicated that DNA damaged by ultraviolet light and harbouring oxidative modifications was unable to be degraded by TREX1 (Ref. 66). Such DNA could trigger STING activity and may constitute a new damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that can aggravate STING-dependent autoinflammatory disease.\n\nCollectively, these studies show that the body has devised several mechanisms to prevent self-DNA from activating host defence-related DNA sensors, such as STING. TREX1 probably prevents intrinsic self-DNA-mediated activation of STING signalling, whereas DNase II may prevent STING-dependent activation by extrinsic signals in phagocytes. These DNases constitute indirect negative regulators of STING and, when defective, they can result in constitutive STING activity and the onset of inflammatory disease (Fig. 3). Understanding these processes may enable the design of new drugs for the treatment of inflammatory disease.\n\nAs discussed, the STING signalling pathway probably arose to detect aberrant cytosolic DNA species from an infectious agent or from leakage of self-DNA from the nucleus of damaged cells7. However, these might not be the only sources of cytosolic DNA. The hundreds, if not thousands, of mitochondria in the cytosol of most cells contain 2\u201310 copies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which exist as closed circular dsDNA species of approximately 15,000 base pairs67. Recent evidence indicates that mitochondrial stress, such as that induced by viruses, can cause mtDNA leakage into the cytosol that can activate the STING pathway and the production of cytokines68. Although this particular example may be of benefit to the host, the sensing of mtDNA that has leaked into the cytosol following apoptosis-induced mitochondrial stress may have detrimental effects. However, as up to 50 billion cells undergo apoptosis in the body per day, it is thus inevitable that the body has developed an effective means to enable programmed cell death events to be immunologically silent. Indeed, certain caspases may prevent the induction of inflammatory responses by cytosolic mtDNA69,70.\n\nThe process of apoptosis involves the activation of the pro-death molecules BAK and BAX, which induce mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and causes the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol where it forms a complex with apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1) and caspase 9, termed the apoptosome. This in turn activates caspase 3 and caspase 7, which start to target cellular proteins. Despite the fact that certain caspases have an important role in apoptosis, they are not essential for cell death and in vivo clearance of cells, suggesting that they may exert other important functions71. Indeed, recent studies have shown that BAK- and BAX-induced MOMP can also cause the release of mtDNA, the induction of cGAS\u2013STING signalling and type I IFN production69,70. The effector caspases, caspase 3, caspase 7 and caspase 9, were shown to be required to prevent mtDNA-induced STING activation69,70. How this occurs is not yet fully apparent but may involve caspase-mediated targeting of proteins involved in STING-dependent signalling or even indirect targeting of mtDNA. Of course, such events require that STING be present in cells undergoing apoptosis and fortunately, STING is not abundantly expressed in cells such as hepatocytes, which are known to contain thousands of mitochondria7. A further conundrum is that caspase-deficient mice do not necessarily develop autoimmune disease, suggesting that caspase loss may affect other elements of the immune system to prevent disease development71.\n\nIt is interesting to note that dysfunctional mitochondria have been reported to occur in autoimmune diseases such as SLE, but whether disease pathogenesis involves release of mtDNA and activation of STING remains to be determined72. It has also been suggested that inhibitors of effector caspases could serve as antiviral therapies because they may upregulate the production of type I IFNs by released mtDNA72. In summary, the immunological silencing of programmed cell death involves an unclarified mechanism that prevents leaked mtDNA from triggering STING-dependent inflammatory processes.\n\nSTING-aggravated tumorigenesis. Chronic inflammatory signalling may not only instigate autoinflammatory disease such as AGS or STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) but can also contribute to the development of cancer, probably through cytokines, chemokines and growth factors that stimulate cellular proliferation and survival, as well as by promoting angiogenesis73.\n\nInflammation induced by carcinogens, which cause DNA mutations, aggravates tumour development by mechanisms that remained to be determined. In one example, the polyaromatic hydrocarbon 7,12-dimethylbenz[\u03b1]anthracene (DMBA) can drive the development of cutaneous skin tumours by promoting pro-inflammatory cytokine production and stimulating phagocytic infiltration69,74,75. Indeed, mice deficient for MYD88 or for tumour necrosis factor (TNF) are relatively resistant to DMBA-induced skin carcinogenesis, indicating the importance of MYD88-dependent signalling and induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF in this process74,75.\n\nThe trigger that controls primary innate immune responses as a consequence of DNA damage, however, has remained largely unknown. Evidence indicates that TLR-independent pathways could have a key role in this process74. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that STING-deficient mice are resistant to DMBA-induced skin polyp formation76. This study showed that DMBA-initiated DNA damage lead to nucleosome leakage into the cytosol and triggered STING-dependent cytokine production by the self-DNA. It is possible that DNA-damaged keratinocytes intrinsically produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that attract phagocytes, which may facilitate the removal of the damaged cells. These infiltrating immune cells may engulf damaged keratinocytes, and the cellular DNA from the dying cells may extrinsically activate STING signalling to further propagate pro-inflammatory cytokine production74 (Fig. 4). This model is supported by the observation that the adoptive transfer of wild-type bone marrow cells to Tmem173\u2212/\u2212 mice \u2014 which are resistant to DMBA-induced skin tumour development \u2014 results in the development of skin tumours similar to those that develop in control mice following treatment with DMBA62,76. Thus, STING signalling in haematopoietic cells, similar to MYD88 signalling, plays an important part in facilitating DMBA-induced tumorigenesis.\n\nSTING-dependent dsDNA-induced innate immune gene transcription is unaffected in Myd88\u2212/\u2212 cells, which suggests that MYD88 activation occurs downstream of STING induction in response to DNA-damaging agents76. Thus, the current model suggests that DNA damage triggers STING-driven production of cytokines, which in an autocrine or paracrine manner can bind to receptors that signal via the MYD88 adaptor molecule, such as the IL-1 receptor and TLRs. This further drives the production of additional cytokines and growth factors that propagate inflammation and facilitate skin tumorigenesis. It is unclear whether STING has a role in other types of inflammation-aggravated cancer, such as hepatocellular carcinoma. Clearly, understanding the involvement of STING in such events may lead to the design of new anticancer therapeutics.\n\nAntitumour effects of STING. Although MYD88 signalling facilitates carcinogenesis in the skin, MYD88 signalling is protective in models of colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC), which can be experimentally induced by carcinogens and inflammatory agents such as azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)74,76. It is possible that cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 are secreted by damaged intestinal cells to facilitate wound repair20,72,77,78. In the absence of wound repair, concomitant inflammation alters the microbial composition in the gut to species with enhanced genotoxic capacity, resulting in further inflammation, DNA damage and tumorigenesis79,73.\n\nThe phenotype of STING-deficient mice treated with AOM and DSS mimicked that of similarly treated MYD88-deficient mice; the loss of STING rendered mice susceptible to CAC80. Further investigation showed that AOM induced DNA damage and triggered STING-dependent cytokine production, including the production of IL-1\u03b2. It is thus possible that cGAS\u2013STING recognizes early DNA damaging events to trigger the production of wound repair-initiating cytokines (Fig. 4b). STING activation in damaged intestinal cells also activates type I IFNs, which exert potent effects on the priming of antitumour T cells (see later). Thus, loss of STING may enable damaged cells to escape tumour immunosurveillance80,81,82. In summary, STING signalling may have an important protective effect against CAC, the second most common cancer in both men and women. Further analysis of the function of STING in controlling colorectal and/or intestinal wound repair, as well as its influence on the composition of the microbiota, will no doubt shed further insight into the importance of STING in influencing tumorigenesis.\n\nSTING signalling and adaptive antitumour immunity. Adaptive T cell responses are important for the control and eradication of tumour cells82. Numerous immunotherapeutic strategies involving stimulating the adaptive immune response against cancers through checkpoint blockade are presently under evaluation in clinical trials. However, how adaptive immune responses are generated by DCs against tumour cells remains unknown. What is apparent is that type I IFN production by CD8\u03b1+ DCs is involved in tumour antigen-specific T cell activation through the cross-presentation of antigen and T cell priming83. The signalling pathway responsible for type I IFN induction is thought to be independent of the TLR or RIG-I\u2013mitochondrial antiviral signalling (MAVS) protein pathways.\n\nRecent studies have shown that the STING pathway is essential for radiation-induced and spontaneous natural antitumour T cell responses83,84. STING-deficient mice are unable to generate efficient antitumour T cell responses and prevent melanoma tumour growth. Furthermore, the ability of checkpoint inhibitors to stimulate T cell responses was also abrogated in STING-deficient mice, indicating a role for STING in the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors79. One hypothesis for the underlying mechanism is that CD8\u03b1+ DCs engulf necrotic tumour cells, and the tumour cell-derived DNA triggers STING signalling in the DC20,83,84,85. The resultant type I IFNs, functioning in a paracrine or autocrine manner, may induce the production of additional proteins in the DC that facilitates cross-presentation and T cell activation (Fig. 4c).\n\nIt is known that apoptotic cells do not potently activate innate immune signalling. But, engulfment of necrotic cells may trigger cytokine production, albeit at low levels, in a STING-dependent manner20. Usually, DNase II in phagocytes efficiently digests engulfed cellular DNA in the lysosomal compartment, and it is not yet clear why some host DNA from necrotic cells escape this process. It is possible that STING is activated by DNA that is present in autophagosomes or in engulfed exosomes83,84. Collectively, further understanding of the role of STING in facilitating adaptive immune responses may have notable consequences in the design of future anticancer immunotherapies.\n\nInsight into the role of STING in facilitating antitumour T cell responses has stimulated interest in evaluating whether STING agonists could be useful therapies to treat cancer. The STING activator 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) was already known to exert antitumour activity but was only specific for mouse STING and failed to work in human patients86. However, several reports indicate that CDNs that bind human STING can exert antitumour activity in animal studies87. In some instances, STING agonists were shown to be effective against tumours that were resistant to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) blockade88. Such agonists have also been shown to be experimentally useful as adjuvants in anticancer vaccine studies89,90. Thus, the development of novel STING activators may lead to the generation and rapid expansion of immunotherapy trials to combat cancer.\n\nFinally, it is noteworthy that anticancer drugs such as cisplatin and etoposide are also DNA adduct-forming agents that trigger cell death by instigating DNA damage91. These drugs were found to cause nuclear DNA leakage into the cytosol and to trigger intrinsic STING-dependent cytokine activity62. It is tempting to speculate that such drugs may exert their anticancer effects, in part, by stimulating the STING pathway and activating the immune system. Conversely, defects in STING signalling may contribute to chemoresistance in certain types of cancer.\n\nThe importance of STING in generating cytokines in response to DNA damage has been further emphasized in cells with defects in their DNA repair machinery92,93. Dysfunction in ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a kinase that facilitates DNA repair, or in the co-binding protein meiotic recombination 11 homologue (MRE11) lead to the production of cytokines, which may contribute to the inflammatory phenotypes noted in patients with Ataxia telangiectasia93. Loss of DNA repair mechanisms may enable self-DNA to leak out of the cytoplasm to activate STING, or STING may be targeted by DNA repair machinery directly or indirectly to induce signalling76,93. Collectively, it is becoming apparent that STING has a key role in facilitating antitumour immune responses. Furthermore, stimulating STING activity within the tumour microenvironment may comprise a new immunotherapeutic strategy to help treat malignant disease.\n\nGrowing evidence indicates that the intrinsic STING pathway is crucial for recognizing DNA pathogens or damaged DNA in the cytosol. The innate immune response that ensues can attract immune cells that phagocytose the infected or damaged cells. The DNA from engulfed cells can stimulate extrinsic STING signalling in the phagocytes, thereby promoting further inflammatory signals.\n\nThe engulfment of apoptotic cells is immunologically silent, perhaps owing to the expression of caspases and DNases that prevent intrinsic and extrinsic STING activation. However, cancer cells are able to stimulate modest extrinsic STING activity in antigen-presenting cells such as CD8\u03b1+ DCs, and this appears to be a sufficient and essential process for the efficient priming of antitumour T cells. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of this cross-priming may lead to the development of potent antitumour vaccines and therapies94,95.\n\nIt remains to be seen what other types of inflammatory or other diseases may be caused by defects in the STING pathway. But it is possible that suppressing STING activity may help to avoid autoinflammatory disease and certain types of cancer83,96. Thus, designing drugs that trigger or repress cGAS or STING activation and/or signalling could be of interest to the anticancer, anti-pathogen, anti-inflammatory and vaccine research fields."}
