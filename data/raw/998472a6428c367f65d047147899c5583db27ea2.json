Immune and/or Host Defense Functions of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with depression based on meta-analyses of genome-wide association (GWAS) studies", "body": "Gene Name Immune Function of Gene ATP6V1B2 ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal 56/58kDa, V1 subunit B2\n\nATP6V1B2 is a component of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) that is involved in cytoskeletal functioning necessary for T cell movement and ability to form functional immunological synapses with antigen presenting cells; 27 V-ATPase is important for host defense against M. tuberculosis by contributing to phagosomal maturation/acidification; 28 via secretion of SidK L. pneumophila (cause of Legionnaires' disease) inhibits V-ATPase allowing for vacuolar survival and enhanced virulence; 29 V-ATPase contributes to early intracellular survival strategy of F. Tularensis; 30 V-ATPase is a target for P. aeruginosa produced pyocyanin, which kills competing microbes and mammalian cells during pseudomonal infection; 31 by contributing to endosomal acidification V-ATPases promote influenza A virus infection, 32 conversely V-ATPase inhibition has been shown to be protective against highly virulent influenza strains; 33 V-ATPase inhibition inhibits rhinovirus infection of airway epithelial cells via blocking viral RNA entry into endosomes and by reducing ICAM-1 expression in epithelial cells. 34 during pregnancy and in tumorgenesis, a2NTD, which is cleaved from the a2 isoform of V-ATPase upregulates pro-and anti-inflammatory mediators including IL-1b and IL-10; 35-38 V-ATPase promotes fetal implantation and survival by modulating cytokine network at implantation site and attenuating maternal immune response against fetal trophoblast cells; 38\n\nSpecificity protein 4 transcription factor SP4 activates the HIV-1 LTR promoter, 39 possibly enhancing HIV-1 Tat-mediated transactivation of the viral promoter. Consistent with these effects an intergenic SNP in SP4 (rs6951646) may confer vulnerability for mother-to-child transmission of HIV; 40 Curcumin shown to inhibit NF\u03baB signaling in part via downregulation of SP4; 41 COX-2 inhibitors inhibit VEGF gene expression via activation of proteasome-dependent degradation of SP4; 42 GRM7 glutamate receptor, metabotropic 7\n\nMice with targeted deletion of mGluR7 show enhanced sensitivity to glucocorticoid inhibitory feedback on the HPA axis, 43 which would be expected to reduce inflammatory signaling. This raises the possibility that mGluR7 signaling may support proinflammatory activity AK294384 similar to Muskelin 1 (MKLN1)\n\nMuskelin gene expression is reduced in neutrophils from patients with generalized aggressive peridontitis, a proinflammatory condition characterized by increased neutrophil IL-1b gene expression; 44 muskelin appears to be an isoform-specific anchoring protein for the prostaglandin EP3 receptor 45 LY86 lymphocyte antigen 86 aka MD-1 LY86 codes for myeloid differentiation protein MD-1, which has been recently shown to bind LPS; 46 MD-1-null mice show impairment in LPS-induced B-cell proliferation, antibody production, and B7.2/CD86 up-regulation; 47 inhibition of MD-1 increases expression of IL-4, IL-10 and TGF-beta and decreases IL-2, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha expression with resultant improvement in allograft and fetal graft survival; 48-50 dorsal root ganglion neurons express the unusual combination of CD-14, TLR4, and MD-1. Blocking antibodies against TLR4 and MD-1 prevents induction of nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ), an opioid-related peptide that is markedly up-regulated in sensory neurons in vivo following peripheral inflammation that plays a key role in pain physiology; 51 blockade of MD1 functional activity in dendritic results in elevated Treg induction in response to allogeneic stimulation (in vivo or in vitro) in the presence of LPS; 52 via linkage to CD14, MD-1 comprises a \"danger receptor complex,\" and activation of this complex regulates dendritic cell surface expression of CD80/CD86, which signal T cells. 53\n\nkiller-specific secretory protein of 37 kDa aka fibroblast growth factor binding protein 2\n\nWithin leukocytes, Ksp37 expression is limited to Th1-type CD4(+) T cells, effector CD8(+) T cells, gamma-delta T cells, and CD16(+) NK cells. Most of these Ksp37-expressing cells coexpress perforin, suggesting that Ksp37 is selectively and commonly expressed in the lymphocytes that have cytotoxic potential. 54\n\nimmunoglobulin superfamily, member 9B\n\nNo functional data available for IGSF9B, however likely immune and/or host defense relevance is suggested by the fact that members of the immunoglobulin superfamily include cell surface antigen receptors, co-receptors and co-stimulatory molecules of the immune system, molecules involved in antigen presentation to lymphocytes, cell adhesion molecules, certain cytokine receptors and intracellular muscle proteins \u2022 Varicella-zoster virus enhances its replication in melanocytic skin cells by inhibiting I-CAM producing in the center of skin lesions, in part by inhibiting TNF-alpha induced translocation of p50 to the nucleus; 69\n\n\u2022 Upon rhinovirus exposure, beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists reduces rhinovirus titers and RNA, cytokine concentrations, and susceptibility to rhinovirus infection inhibited the activation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) proteins, including p50 and p65, in the nucleus while increasing cytosolic concentrations of the inhibitory kappa Balpha; 70\n\n\u2022 Apoptosis is significantly reduced in the CNS of p50-null mice following reovirus infection, but massively increased in concert with uncontrolled reovirus replication in the heart, an effect associated with marked reductions in reovirus-induced IFN-beta mRNA in the heart and partially reversed by IFN-beta administration; 71\n\n\u2022 Downregulation of NFKB1 expression during Dengue infection in children is likely protective given that increased NFKB1 expression correlates with increased incidence of hemorrhagic events and with a trend toward increases in multiple other lifethreatening complications; 72\n\n\u2022 Increased NF-\u03baB production in response to Y. Pestis reduces infectious severity and mortality in animal models; 73\n\n\u2022 In the context of a number of infection by a number of viruses (e.g. HSV-1, HCMV), p50 appears to have conflicting effects on viral replication and spread, reducing these phenomena by stimulating apoptosis of infected cells while at the same time encouraging viral spread via herpes manipulation of the transcription factor for its own replicative purposes; 74,75\n\n\u2022 NF-\u03baB protects against Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis via stimulation of CD8+ T cells and IFN-gamma production; 76\n\n\u2022 Polymorphisms in NFKB1 have been associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome, 77,78 autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in Asian populations by meta-analysis, 79 and with both incidence and severity of inflammatory bowel disease in other populations in individual studies, 80,81 and persistent viremia in HCV infection; 82 \u2022 NF-kappaB p50 subunit is protective during intestinal Entamoeba histolytica infection of the gut in animal models; 83 LOC654346 aka LGALS9C lectin, galactoside-binding, soluble, 9C\n\nLOC654346 codes for a protein identical, or highly similar, to galectin 9, which has widespread, highly complex, and partially paradoxical immune effects that in general appear to be anti-inflammatory via suppression of T1 and Th17 T cell immunity and enhancement of Treg; 84-86 However, galectin-9 y binding to T cell Ig mucin-3 (Tim3) expressed on different cells, galectin-9 activates innate immune dendritic cells via a specific carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), suggesting that it may enhance antigen presentation; 87,88 via interaction with Tim3 expressed on T(H)1 cells, galectin-9, which is expressed by M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages, restricts intracellular bacterial growth. Tim3-galectin-9 interaction accomplishes this by leading to macrophage activation with resultant bactericidal activity induced by caspase-1-dependent IL-1\u03b2 secretion; 89 galectin-9 has been shown to be an immunomodulator in the context of L. major infection. Galectin 9 recognizes L. major by binding to the L. major-specific polygalactosyl epitope and promotes interaction between L. major and macrophages; 90 galectin-9 attenuates CD8(+) T cell immunity to herpes simplex virus infection via direct inhibition of TIM3(+) CD8(+) T cells and indirectly by enhancing Foxp3(+) Treg activity; 91 galectin-9 is an eosinophil chemoattractant produced by activated T cells, 92 but also demonstrates anti-allergic effects by blocking IgE-antigen complex formation, 93 as well as an ability to inhibit contact hypersensitivity and psoriatic reactions; 94 by attenuating Th1 responses galectin-9 inhibits autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice, 95 and ameliorates arthritis in animal models via regulation of Fc gamma receptor expression on macrophages, 96 as well as by suppressing the generation of Th17 cells and inducing Treg; 85 galectin-9 promotes NK cell-mediated anti-tumor activity by expanding macrophages with a unique plasmacytoid cell-like phenotype (PDCA-1 and B220); 97 NMNAT2 nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 2\n\nNo specific immune and/or host defense functions reported.\n\nlaminin, gamma 2 Gamma 2 laminin chain production is stimulated by TNF-alpha; 98 In response to wounding, laminin gamma2 chains are processed to smaller sizes and function to promote epithelial sheet migration over the wound bed; 99 Expressed primarily in nasal epithelium where it glucuronidates an array of inhaled substances. 103 No known immune/host defense effects.\n\nUDP glucuronosyltransfer ase 2 family, polypeptide A1, complex locus\n\nNo specific immune and/or host defense functions reported for UGT1A1; however, because UGT2A1 enhances bilirubin elimination by catalyzing its conjugation glucuronic acid, 104 an anti-inflammatory effect might be expected, given that increased levels of bilirubin are associated with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines; 105 in animal models, increased bilirubin associated with impaired PMN phagocytosis of S. Aureus, suggesting that UGT21 activity may enhance host defense against bacterial pathogens, as a result of reducing bilirubin levels; 106 ATG7 autophagy related 7 homolog\n\nThe autophagy degradation pathway is essential for eliminating intracellular pathogens, presenting endogenous antigens to immune cells and regulating T and B lymphocyte survival, proliferation and function 107 ; 108 knocking down ATG7 inhibits hepatitis C virus (HCV) growth via increased activity in interferon (IFN)-alpha and IFN-alpha-inducible protein 27 signaling pathways, as well as by increased caspase activation, polymerase cleavage and apoptosis of infected cells; 109 ATG7 is essential for production of myeloid and lymphoid progenitor cells; 110 CUGBP1 CUG triplet repeat, RNA binding protein 1 CUGBP1 is a downstream effector of IFN-beta signaling in primary macrophages that is thought to play a pivotal role in innate immune responses that control acute HIV/SIV replication in the brain; 111 CUGBP1 participates in acute phase response in liver following LPS exposure by inducing the low molecular weight CCAAT/Enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) beta isoform, liver-enriched transcriptional inhibitory protein (LIP); 112 CUGBP1 impairs stabilization of TNF-alpha mRNA transcripts; 113 BBOX is one of less than 1% of genes in cultured macrophages which demonstrates a change in gene expression in response to diesel exhaust particles (BBOX1 is downregulated); 125 because gamma butyrobetaine hydroxylase catalyzes the formation of Lcarnitine from gamma-butyrobetaine, the last step in the L-carnitine biosynthetic pathway, one might predict host defense relevance given evidence that L-carnitine has stimulatory effects on a number of immune functions including neutrophil activity, delayed-type hypersensitivit and the conycentrations of immunoglobulins A and G (but not IgM); 126 deficiency in L-carnitine activity/availability has been repeatedly associated with increased risk of encephalopathy in response to viral infection; 127-129 L-carnitine shown to have anti-inflammatory properties in obese diabetic patients; 130 ATF3 activating transcription factor 3 ATF3 functions as a \"hub\" of the cellular adaptive-response network that modulates inflammatory responses, cellular division and apoptosis; 131,132 NF-kappaB, C/EBPdelta and ATF3 have been shown to form a regulatory circuit that discriminates between transient and persistent Toll-like receptor 4-induced signals, which is hypothesized to be a mechanism that enables the innate immune system to detect the duration of infection and to respond appropriately; 133 ATF3 overexpression stimulates apoptotic cell death following Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) infection and augments CVB3 infection-induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation. However, ATF3 overexpression does not affect viral protein production, but rather promotes virus progeny release; 134 via interaction with a cis-regulatory site on the IFN-gamma gene, ATF3 reduces NK cell activity against murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), with a resultant increase in viral pathology. Correspondingly, ATF3null mice show exhibit decreased hepatic viral load and reduced liver histopathology upon challenge with MCMV; 135 ATF3 is one of a small set of genes upregulated by adenovirus infection prior to commencement of viral gene expression; 136,137 ATF3 is required for the interferon-induced serine/threonine protein kinase (PKR) to induce apoptosis of virally infected cells; 138 ATF3 is also functionally important in mediating the pro-apoptotic effects of the proinflammatory p38 MAPK signaling pathway; 139 ATF3 production is stimulated by IL-12, IL-18 and IFN-alpha. Conflicting data suggest ATF3 may enhance or repress the development of a Th1 cytokine profile in CD+ T cells; 140,141 Blocking ATF3 reduces IL-6 production in response to TLR stimulation; 142 .ATF3 is induced by, and induces TGF-beta and is essential for activation of TGF-beta target genes; 143 ATF3 induces STAT1; 144 ATF3 enhances inflammatory responses to grafted islet cells promoting rejection; 145 ATF3 is required for mast cell maturation and function; 132 with heat shock transcription factor-1, ATF3 is necessary for ability of febrile temperatures to suppress IL-6 production; 146 ATF3acts as a transcriptional repressor of TLR4 signaling, 147 leading to transcriptional repression of TNF-alpha production in macrophages; 148 LPS-induced expression of matrix metalloproteinases in human monocytes is suppressed by IFN-gamma via superinduction of ATF-3; 149 in a mouse model of human asthma, ATF3-deficiency significantly increases airway hyperresponsiveness, pulmonary eosinophilia, and enhances chemokine and Th2 cytokine responses in lung tissue and in lung-derived CD4(+) lymphocytes; 150 ATF is increased by COX-2 activity; 151\n\nC14orf49 aka NET53 and nesprin-3\n\nNo specific immune and/or host defense functions reported \n\nRORA retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor alpha RORA, in combination with ROR-gamma, is essential for differentiation of na\u00efve T cells in to Th17 phenotype, and RORA blockade prevents Th17 differentiation; 152-154 knocking down RORA receptor activity in mice is associated with increased T cell IFN-gamma production following T-cell receptor stimulation, with increased TNF-alpha and IL-6 production upon activation of macrophages or mast cells, with increased IgG antibodies following immunization with a T-Cell dependent antigen and with increased CD8+ T cell cytotoxic activity against L. monocytogenes infected cells; 155 Bacteroides, C. rodentium) secrete factors that enhance virulence by interacting with Ecahedrin to disrupt cellular junctions thus promoting entry of pathogen or toxins into host tissues; 167-173 cleavage of E-cadherin by calpains generated in response to TLR2 mediated Ca(2+) fluxes promote the transepithelial migration of PMNs within the lung during P aeruginosa infection; 174 mechanisms that regulate the retention of tissue-resident memory T cells include transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)-mediated induction of the E-cadherin receptor CD103 and downregulation of the chemokine receptor CCR7. These pathways enhance protection in internal organs, such as the nervous system, and in the barrier tissues--the mucosa and skin. Memory T cells that reside at these surfaces provide a first line of defense against subsequent infection, and defining the factors that regulate their development is critical to understanding organ-based immunity. 175 EIF3F eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit F EIF3F is a protein synthesis initiation factor that potently inhibits HIV-1 replication; 176,177 EIF3F is a component of the nuclear interactome of the HIV-1 encoded regulatory protein Tat, which is essential for HIV-1 replication and primarily orchestrates HIV-1 provirus transcriptional regulation; 5 EIF3F is required for initiation of HCV RNA translation in host cells and its induction is essential for the ability of iron to increase HCV expression; 178-181 In cells infected with poliovirus, cellular mRNA fails to bind to ribosomes, and synthesis of the majority of cellular proteins ceases, a pathological process dependent upon viral 2Apro cleavage of EIF3F; 182,183 EIF3F-induced deubiquitination essential for activation of Notch signaling pathway. 184 The Notch pathway has numerous effects relevant to inflammation/host-pathogen defense, 185 [204] [205] [206] [207] ITGB1 contributes to host defense against S. pneumonia by allowing leukocytes direct access to lung bronchioles early in the infectious process; 208 blockade of integrin beta-1 significantly reduces TNF-alpha production by monocytes, peritoneal and alveolar macrophages in response to heat-killed S. aureus; 209 integrin beta-1contributes to development of non-T cell-dependent extrafollicular antigen-specific splenic plasmablasts important for protection against intracellular bacteria such as l pathogens such as Ehrlichia muris; 210 human CMV infection may increase risk of cardiovascular disease by increasing endothelial cell proliferation, motility, and capillary tube formation in dependence upon binding to and signaling through the beta(1) and beta(3) integrins and the epidermal growth factor receptor, via their ability to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways; 211 human CMV ability to activate IFN-alpha signaling is partially dependent on viral interactions with integrin beta-1, whereas HCMV induced proinflammatory cytokine production is TLR2, but not ITGB1-dependent; 211 binding interactions of bacteria intimin with epithelial integrin beta-1 are essential for infection of human colonic epithelium by Shiga toxin-producing Enterohemorrhagic E. coli; 212 anopheline antiplatelet protein (AAPP) isolated from the saliva of Anopheles stephensi, a human malaria vector mosquito, exhibites a strong and specific inhibitory activity toward collagen-induced platelet aggregation (allowing blood feeding to proceed effectively) that depends in part upon integrin beta-1; 213 integrin beta-1 required for long-term retention of memory CD4+ T cells in bone marrow following L. monocytogenes infection, although integrin beta-1 is not required for maintenance of long-term pathogenspecific memory CD+ T cells; 214 stimulation of the TLR4 by LPS activates PI3K/AKT signaling and promotes downstream beta-1 integrin function, which has been implicated in increased cancer cell adhesiveness and metastatic potential; 215 GRM8 glutamate receptor, metabotropic 8 GRM8 (a type III mGlu) has been identified as a vulnerability gene for inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's) in more than one population sample, 216 suggesting a link between GRM8 and inflammatory functioning; GRM8 activation reduces hyperalgesia in response to inflammatory stimulation in animal models; 217 in response to inflammatory signaling, polymorphonuclear leukocytes release glutamate that decreases human brain endothelial barrier function via reductions in phosphorylated vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, 218 suggesting that type III mGlu signaling is involved in PMN migration in response to infection; type III mGlu stimulation mediates the excitotoxic effects of the proinflammatory mediators homocysteine and homocysteic acid; 219 type III mGlu stimulation blocks TLR4-activated microglia inhibition of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (which is driven by microglia TNFalpha/IL-6 production); 220\n\nBrockmann \n\nHe B, Weber GF: Synergistic activation of the CMV promoter by NF-kappaB P50 and"}
