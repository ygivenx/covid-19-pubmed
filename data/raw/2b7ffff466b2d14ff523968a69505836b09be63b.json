{"title": "Archives of Virology Hemagglutination with transmissible gastroenteritis virus Brief Report", "body": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus grown in primary swine kidney cell cultures agglutinated erythroeytes from chicken, guinea pig and cattle but not erythrocytes from mouse and goose. The opthnal incubation temperature was at 4 \u00b0 C. The hemagglutination (HA) reaction was inhibited by specific antiserum. Some factors involved in the HA and HA-inhibition (HI) were investigated and standard HA and HI tests were established. HI antibody titers of individual pig sera showed a significant positive correlation with their neutralizing antibody titers.\n\nSome viruses of the familiy Coronaviridae, such as human coronavirus (8, 9) bovine eoronavirus (12, 13) hemagglutinating eneephMomyelitis virus (6, 7, 11) and avian infectious bronchitis virus (1, 3) , are already known to have hemagglutinating (HA) activity. These observations encouraged us to investigate the possibility of HA by transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) vires, a member of the family Coronaviridae, as this has not been previously reported. This paper describes our observations on the HA with the virus and ItA-inhibition (HI) by specific antiserum.\n\nThe TGE virus strains used were the TO and SH strain (5) supplied by Dr. S. Furuuchi, National Institute of Animal Health, Tsukuba, Japan, and the Ukiha strain (4) supplied by Dr. M. Eto, Chemo-Sero-Therapeutie Research Institute, Kumamoto, Kumamoto, Japan. The h-5 and U strains, which were recovered from the attenuated TGE vaccines purchased from the Nippon Institute for Biological Science, Oome, Tokyo, and the Chemo-Sero-Therapeutie Research Institute, Kumamoto, Kumamoto, Japan, respectively, were also used.\n\nThe passage levels in primary swine kidney (SK) cell cultures of tile TO, SH, Ukiha, h-5 and U strains used were 165,166, 128 and 72, respectively. The TO strain was mainly used.\n\nPrimary SK cells and CPK cells, a continuous cell line derived from pig kidney, were prepared as described previously (10) and used for preparation of HA antigens and titration of viruses, respectively. The growth medium was Earle's solution containing 0.5percent laetMbumin hydrolysate, 10 per cent bovine serum, 1 per cent of 7 per cent NaHC03, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 t~g/ml streptomycin, 100 ~g/ml kanamycin and 2 ~g/ml fungizone for SK cells and Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 10percent bovine serum, lOper cent tryptose phosphate broth (TPB), 1 per cent of 7 per cent NaHC03 and antibiotics as above for CPK cells. The maintenance medium for both cells was MEM containing 10 per cent ofTPB, 2 per cent of 7 per cent NaHCOa and antibiotics as above.\n\nConfluent cultures of SK cells prepared in 500 ml bottles were inoculated with TGE virus, and incubated at 37 \u00b0 C with 30 ml of maintenance medium tbr 3 days or longer until the eytopathie effect was complete. In some preliminary experiments, culture fluid harvested from infected cells was used as HA antigen after eentrifugation to remove cellular debris. In subsequent experiments, however, HA antigens concentrated from infected culture fluid were used.\n\nThe microtiter method was used for the HA and HI tests. The diluent was PBS (phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.2), unless otherwise stated. Blood was obtained in Alsever's solution and stored at 4 \u00b0 C. Chicken er3~hrocytes were used in 0.5 per cent suspension, unless otherwise stated. In HA tests, serial 2-fold dilutions of HA antigen were prepared in 0.025-ml amounts, and mixed with 0.025 ml of erythroeyte suspension after adding 0.025 ml of the diluent. The mixtures were incubated at. 4 \u00b0 C for 1 hour before the results were read, unless otherwise stated. The HA titer was expressed as the reeiprocM of the highest antigen dilution showing complete HA. In HI tests, the serum was treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) (Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan), unless otherwise stated. One tenth ml of the serum and 0.3 ml ofgDE were mixed and incubated at 37 \u00b0 C for 18 hours. The mixture was then heated at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes, mixed with 0.05 ml of packed erythroeytes and incubated at 37 \u00b0 C for 1 hour. At the end of the incubation, the mixture was centrifuged to sediment the cells and the supernatant fluid was used tbr the test as a 4-fold dilution of the serum. Four units of HA antigen in 0.025 mi and 0.025 ml of scrim 2-fold dilutions of the treated serum were mixed, incubated at 4 \u00b0 C overnight, and then mixed with 0.025 ml of erythroeyte suspension. These mixtures were then ineu-bated at 4 \u00b0 C for 1 hour and the results were read. The HI titer was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution showing complete HI.\n\nNeutralization (N~f) tests were carried out in tube cultures of CPK cells as described previously (2) .\n\nAntisera against the TO strain of TGE virus were prepared in rabbits and guinea pigs by the method described previously (2) . Immune pig sera and serum samples from pigs experimentally infected with TGE virus, which were prepared by one of the authors (2), were also used.\n\nIn preliminary experiments with supernatant fluid harvested from SK cell cultures infected with the TO strain, erythrocytes from chicken and some other animals were found to be agglutinated, although the HA titers obtained were low. To confirm this finding, we prepared concentrated HA antigens by ultraeentrifugation. Infectious culture fluid, after low-speed eentrifugation to remove cellular debris, was centrifuged at. 40,000 x g for 1 hour, and the pellets were suspended in 1/100 the original volume of PBS.\n\nThe concentrated antigens thus prepared were tested for HA with erythroeytes from a variety of species at 4 \u00b0 C, 22 \u00b0 C and 37 \u00b0 C. All the five TGE virus strains tested gave positive HA. The HA titers, however, were affected significantly by the incubation temperature. The titer was considerably higher at 4 \u00b0 C than at 22 \u00b0 C and much lower or negative at 37 \u00b0 C (Table 1) . Chicken erythroeytes gave the highest titer, followed by erythrocytes from guinea pig, cattle and swine. Erythroeytes from mouse and goose gave negative results. HA titers also varied between different samples from the same species.\n\nNo significant change of HA titer occurred, when PBS (pH 7.2), VBS (veronal buffered saline, pH 7.2) and 0.15M NaC1 solution (pH 7.2), respectively, were used as the diluent.\n\nOn the basis of these results, chicken erythroeytes with PBS as the diluent, and incubation at 4 \u00b0 C became the standard method.\n\nCulture fluid harvested from infected CPK cell cultures showing eytopathie changes has HA titers of between 2 and 8. Figure 1 illustrates a representative example of HA antigen production as well as that of viral infectivity in the fluid phase of robe cultures of CPK cells incubated at 37 \u00b0 C after infection at an input multiplieity of 0.1 TCIDso/eell. The HA was first demonstrated 3 days after inoculation, gradually increased and reached a plateau of 8 at 4 days, with a gradual decline thereafter. The curve of viral infectivity resembled that of HA production, although a rise was detected somewhat earlier.\n\nSera from pigs, rabbits and guinea pigs negative for NT antibodies to TGE virus were inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes and showed high titer inhibitory activity to HA by TGE virus. Therefore serum treatments with RDE (see above), kaolin, acetone, trypsin, or potassium periodate were carried out by the method as described previously (14) . These HI activities were completely removed by treatment with RDE. This treatment did not at'feet the HI activity of immune sera. On the other hand, the treatment of serum with kaolin, aceton, trypsin or potassium periodate did not remove nonspecific inhibitors completely. According, sera for the HI test were treated with t~DE in the following experiments.\n\nThe HA reaction was shown to be virus specific, since it could be inhibited by specific antisera (Table 2) . HI and NT tests were carried out on serum samples from pigs infected with the SH strain. All the animals developed antibodies tbr the virus. HI and NT antibodies exhibited a similar pattern of appearance and persistence, NT antibody reaching a plateau 20 days after inoculation. HI antibody became positive in 8 days and reached a maximum titer of 128 at 20 days, remaining constant thereafter (Table 3) .\n\nIndividual serum samples from pigs vaccinated with an attenuated TGE vaccine available commercially were tested for HI and N~ antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2 , HI titers of individual sera showed a significant positive correlation with their NT titers, the correlation coefficient being 0.901 (p < 0.01). The HA and HI tests developed in this study seem very useful and should find a wide application in studies on the virus and associated disease."}
