{"title": "Supplementary information S2 | Cellular pseudoknots Location Example(s)", "body": "Pre-mRNA introns Group I self-splicing introns (eg: Azoarcus, Tetrahymena, Twort)\n\nSelf-splicing activity Group I introns represent a large family of complex ribozymes containing multiple domains, in which folding of the P3-P7 catalytic core involves formation of a PK consisting of long-range base pairing. PK connects two major domains of the ribozyme, forming a \"belt\" around the outside of the folded molecule\n\nThe P3-P7 PK is essential in substrate binding, ribozyme catalysis, and assembling the different domains of the ribozyme Davies et al., 1982 Pleij et al., 1985 Cech 1990 Michel and Westhof 1990 Golden et al., 1998 Vicens and Cech, 2006 Drosophila sytl pre-mRNA Directing editing of Ribosomal RNA 16S rRNA central PK Ribosome function PK is located at the centre of the 16S rRNA and connects the three major domains of this molecule. PK has short stems, yet loop 3 consists of almost all of the 16S rRNA Essential for translation. Organises centre of 30S subunit Pleij et al., 1985 Neefs and Wachter, 1990 Brink et al. 1993 Gutell et al., 1994 Poot et al., 1998 16S rRNA 530 loop PK\n\nShort PK folds 530 loop 530 loop region is a highly conserved 16S rRNA region, forms part of the aminoacyl-tRNA binding site and is involved in the decoding process. PK structure plays a crucial role in translation Power and Noller, 1991 Gutell et al., 1994 16S rRNA 5\u2032 PK Ribosome function PK located in central region of 16S rRNA Essential for translation Gutell et al., 1994 Vila et al., 1996 18S V4 Leffers et al., 1987 Gutell et al., 1994 Rosendahl et al., 1995 Ivanov et al., 1999 Ribozymes ( Keiper et al., 2004 Serganov et al., 2005 Pyrimidine nucleotide synthase ribozyme Catalysing addition of UTP Complex pseudoknot Forms core of ribozyme Chapple et al., 2003.

Biotin binds at helix junction Nix et al., 2000 Vitamin B12-binding PK RNA aptamer with affinity for vitamin B12 H-type pseudoknot with stem 1 forming extensive, interdigitated interactions with loop 3; giving a seven-tiered triplex Perpendicular packing of the helix and the triplex exposes the five nucleotides that cap these elements. Their arrangement creates a large hydrophobic patch, devoid of backbone phosphates and ringed by hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, that serves as the vitamin B12 binding site Lorsch and Szostak, 1994 Sussman et al., 2000 Vio145 RNA aptamer with affinity for the antibiotic viomycin H-type pseudoknot with substructure in loop 3 Molecular details unknown. Viomycin also binds the central PK of 16S rRNA and the HDV ribozyme Wallis et al., 1997 Ag06 RNA aptamer that binds arginine Potential H-type PK although missing expected loop 3 PK involvement not confirmed as molecular details unknown Geiger et al., 1996.
