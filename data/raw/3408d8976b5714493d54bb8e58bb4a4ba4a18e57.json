{"title": "Fluorogenic RT\u00b1PCR assay (TaqMan) for detection and classi\u00aecation of bovine viral diarrhea virus", "body": "Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a common pathogen of cattle that causes major economic losses to dairy industry. The virus is a member of the Pestivirus genus in the family Flaviviridae (Wengler et al., 1995) . BVDV isolates were segregated into two genotypes based on comparison of sequences from the 5 H untranslated region (5 H UTR) of the viral genome (Ridpath et al., 1994; Ridpath and Bolin, 1998) . Infection with BVD Veterinary Microbiology 83 (2001) 1\u00b110 virus causes gastrointestinal disease, reproductive failure, respiratory disorders, fetal malformation and persistent infections (PI). The PI animals act as reservoirs of virus and shed the virus for life exposing other animals in the herd. In addition to a good vaccination program, identi\u00aecation and removal of PI animals from the herd is an essential component of control measures for eradication of BVD virus (Fulton and Burge, 2000; Cortese and Victor, 1999) .\n\nRT\u00b1PCR proved to be sensitive and speci\u00aec for detection of BVD virus (Laamanen et al., 1997; Drew et al., 1999; Renshaw et al., 2000) . Nested PCR was used to simultaneously detect and type BVD virus from clinical specimens (El-Kholy et al., 1998; Gilbert et al., 1999; Ridpath and Bolin, 1998) . In most of the studies, two-step RT\u00b1PCR reaction was followed by agarose gel analysis for the detection of amplicons. Other studies performed probe hybridization (Radwan et al., 1995; Letellier et al., 1999) and restriction enzyme analysis (Canal et al., 1996) to evaluate the speci\u00aecity of the ampli\u00aeed fragments. The application of RT\u00b1PCR and its subsequent analysis in a diagnostic setting requires simple, rapid but reproducible procedures with few steps. The development of\u00afuorogenic PCR utilizing 5 H \u00b13 H nuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase made it possible to eliminate post PCR processing (Holland et al., 1991) .\n\nThe ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (TaqMan) was shown to be a sensitive and rapid method for detection and quantitation of human factor VIII . The system uses oligonucleotide probes labeled with\u00afuorescent dyes, a reporter at the 5 H end and a quencher at the 3 H end (Livak et al., 1995) . The quencher suppresses the reporter dye emission when both are attached to the probe. During each PCR cycle, the Taq DNA polymerase cleaves the reporter dye from the annealed probe by its 5 H \u00b13 H nucleolytic activity (Gibson et al., 1996) . The free reporter dye emits its characteristic signal that can be detected by the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system. The increase in\u00afuorescence emission is proportional to the accumulated PCR products. In this study a TaqMan\u00b1 PCR assay was developed for detection, classi\u00aecation and quantitation of BVD virus in single tube. Speci\u00aec probes were designed to classify BVD virus as genotype I or II. Quantitation of BVD virus was performed using an RNA standard.\n\nBVD viral reference strains NADL, New York-1, Singer (type Ia), Oregon-C24V (type Ia), Draper (type Ib), type II-125 and type II 890 were obtained from National Animal Disease Center (NADC, Ames, IA). The reference strains were propagated in MDBK cells. Reference strains of other bovine viruses were obtained from NADC: bovine respiratory syncycial virus (BRSV), parain\u00afuenza type 3 (PI3), infectious bovine rhinotracheitus virus (IBR), bovine rotavirus, bovine coronavirus, bluetongue virus (BT) and bovine cytomegalovirus (BCMV).\n\nClinical specimens included individual and pooled serum samples. Samples were collected from dairy herds located throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, USA. Blood was allowed to clot and serum was removed and stored at \u00c0708C. Viral RNA was extracted using QIAamp viral RNA puri\u00aecation kits (Qiagen, #52904). Extracted RNA was stored at \u00c0708C until used.\n\nPrimers and probes were designed based on sequence data of genotype I NADL strain (Collet et al., 1988) and genotype II (Ridpath and Bolin, 1995) BVD virus using Primer express-1.0 PE Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The primer set used for RT\u00b1PCR was from a previously reported study (Weinstock et al., 2000) . Primers for TaqMan were common for BVD virus genotypes I and II. The reverse primer has 100% homology for type I BVD with one mismatch for type II. The probes for TaqMan were labeled with a\u00afuorescent reporter dye at 5 H end and a quencher dye at 3 H end. The type I probe contained a\u00afuorescent reporter (6-carboxy\u00afuorescein) (FAM) and a\u00afuorescent quencher (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine) (TAMRA). The type II probe contained a\u00afuorescent reporter (VIC) and TAMRA. Sequences of primers and probes were given Table 1.\n\nThe RT\u00b1PCR was performed in single tube using a single enzyme, recombinant Thermus thermophilus (rTth) DNA polymerase according to Weinstock et al., 2000. TaqMan/RT\u00b1PCR assays were carried out in a 96-well\u00afat-bottomed microtiter plate (Perkin-Elmer). The reaction mixture for each one-tube-TaqMan reaction mix consisted of 5 ml of TaqMan universal 10\u00c2 buffer, 8 ml of 25 mM MgCl 2 , 1 ml of 10 mM forward primer, 1 ml of 10 mM reverse primer, 5 ml of 1 mM\u00afuorogenic FAM labeled BVDV type I probe, 5 ml of 1 mM\u00afuorogenic VIC labeled BVDV type II probe, 1.5 ml of each dNTP (A,C,G,U), 13 ml of DEPC water, 0.25 ml of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (5 U/ ml), 0.25 ml MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (100 U/ml), 1.0 ml of RNAse inhibitor (20 U/ ml), and 2.5 ml of BVD viral RNA sample to a total volume of 50 ml. Thermocycling conditions were as follows: 30 mm at 488C for reverse transcription; 10 min at 958C to activate DNA polymerase and to deactivate RT; 45 cycles of 15 s at 958C to denature and 1 min at 608C for annealing and extension.\n\nThe two-tube TaqMan reaction involved RT and PCR steps in separate tubes with incorporation of\u00afuorogenic probes in the PCR process. The RT mix consisted of 0.5 ml RNAse Inhibitor (40 U/ml), 2.0 ml of 10\u00c2 TaqMan Universal master mix buffer, 3.6 ml MgCl 2 (25 mM), 1.0 ml of reverse primer (10 mM), 1.0 ml each dNTPS A,C,G,U (10 mM), 5.0 ml DEPC water 0.44 ml of moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (50 U/ml). The BVD viral RNA sample was heated at 658C for 5 min and 2.5 ml (10\u00b1100 ng/ml) was added to mix. Thermocycler conditions for RT were 1 h at 428C for RT and 2 min at 728C for denaturing unused RNA sample. The PCR mix was made up to a volume of 50 ml, containing 5.0 ml of 10\u00c2 TaqMan Universal master mix buffer, 80 ml MgCl 2 (25 mM), 1.0 ml of forward primer (10 mM), 1.0 ml of reverse primer (10 mM), 5 ml of 1 mM\u00afuorogenic FAM labeled BVDV type I probe, 5 ml of 1 mM\u00afuorogenic VIC labeled BVDV type II probe, 1.0 ml of each dNTP, 0.25 ml of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (5 U/ml), 12.75 ml of DEPC water and 8 ml of cDNA. After 2 min incubation at 508C, 10 min incubation at 958C, the cDNA was ampli\u00aeed by 40 two-step cycles: 15 s at 958C and 1 min at 608C.\n\nAmpli\u00aecation products from RT\u00b1PCR were visualized on 2.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. In TaqMan\u00b1PCR, ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector measured uorescent signal generated by the sequence-speci\u00aec probes. The plate was scanned at 518 nm (FAM), 552 nm (VIC) and 582 nm (TAMRA). DR n is the\u00afuorescence signal increase due to template ampli\u00aecation. The ampli\u00aecation plots were generated with DR n mean value on the y-axis and cycle number on the x-axis (Gibson et al., 1996) . The threshold cycle (C T ) is the cycle number at which the reporter\u00afuorescence generated by cleavage of the probe passed a \u00aexed threshold above baseline. Standard deviation 10 above base line was used to determine the \u00aexed threshold. For analysis of C T values, less than 15 cycles threshold need to be adjusted manually.\n\nDifferent RT\u00b1PCR methods were tested for detecting BVDV and sensitivities were compared. RT\u00b1PCR assay, one-tube TaqMan and two-tube TaqMan/RT\u00b1PCR assays were evaluated using tissue culture supernatants of BVDV type I (NADL) and type II (125) strains. Ten-fold serial dilutions of virus strains were prepared in DEPC water and RNA extracted from each dilution. In addition, serum of known virus titer from a cow persistently infected with genotype I virus was serially diluted in pooled BVD negative sera. RNA was extracted from each serial dilution and stored \u00c0708C until evaluation.\n\nQuantitation of BVD viral RNA in samples containing unknown quantities depends on the accuracy with which the BVD viral RNA standard was measured. The RNA standard representing the partial 5 H UTR of BVD virus was synthesized in vitro. Viral RNA isolated from NADL strain of BVD virus was reverse transcribed and ampli\u00aeed as described in Section 2.3. The following primer set was used for the above reaction; forward 57 and reverse 421 designed from 5 H UTR of NADL strain (Collet et al., 1988) . The cDNA obtained was ampli\u00aeed in a second round of PCR with the primer set T7-103 and 421. The forward primer T7-103 consists of a 27 bp T-7 promoter sequence (Vanden Heuvel et al., 1993) with 21 bp BVD speci\u00aec sequence of primer 103. Sequences of the above primer sets were given in Table 1 . Amplicons were separated on 2% agarose gel and puri\u00aeed using gel extraction kit (Qiagen, #28704). Pure cDNA was transcribed to cRNA with T-7 RNA polymerase (Ambion, #1356). Ethanol precipitation and DNase treatment I puri\u00aeed the transcript to remove unused cDNA. Similar experiment was repeated with Type II-125 strain of BVD virus genotype II. Primers 87 and 372 were designed from type II sequence (Ridpath and Bolin, 1995) for \u00aerst round ampli\u00aecation followed by second round PCR with T-7-103 and primer 372. The cDNA obtained was transcribed to cRNA as explained above. The RNA transcripts were dissolved in DEPC treated water and quanti\u00aeed by spectrophotometer. The cRNA was stored at \u00c0708C. TaqMan\u00b1PCR was performed with 10-fold serial dilutions (from 10 8 copies to 1 copy of RNA per reaction) as described in the above section.\n\nBVD virus reference strains, \u00aeeld isolates and clinical diagnostic samples were tested using TaqMan\u00b1PCR assay. The tissue culture propagated reference strains including NADL, NewYork-1 Singer (type Ia), Oregon C24V (type Ib), Draper (type Ib), type-II 125, type II 890 and type II PA-1, tested positive by TaqMan\u00b1PCR. A total of 23 BVD positive \u00aeeld isolates obtained from New York and Wyoming were correctly identi\u00aeed by TaqMan\u00b1PCR. In previous the study, sera from 80 cattle herds were screened for BVD virus by RT\u00b1PCR and virus isolation methods. Twenty herds contained sera that were positive for BVD virus. RNA was extracted from pools of 30\u00b1100 sera. All pooled sera positive by RT\u00b1PCR were also positive by TaqMan\u00b1PCR. The optimized technique was applied on routine diagnostic serum samples from thirty \u00aeve herds that were pooled in thirties. Pooled sera from four herds shown to be positive by TaqMan\u00b1PCR were tested with individual virus isolation to \u00aend positive animals in the pool. Results from TaqMan\u00b1 PCR were correlated with individual virus isolation. TaqMan\u00b1PCR with BVD speci\u00aec primers and probes was negative for bovine viruses BRSV, PI3, IBR, bovine rotavirus, bovine coronavirus, and BT-17.\n\nBVD virus positive samples shown to be positive by TaqMan\u00b1PCR were simultaneously classi\u00aeed into genotypes I and II. Eighteen of the 20 herds were positive for type I and the other two herds were positive for type II BVD virus. All reference strains were correctly identi\u00aeed into genotypes. Some tissue culture propagated BVD \u00aeeld isolates, 5 samples of 23 obtained from Cornell University, New York, were positive for both types I and II. These \u00aeve samples were submitted to NADC (Ames, IA) and shown to be genotype II BVD by nested PCR according to Ridpath and Bolin (1998) .\n\nThe sensitivity of detection of BVD virus strains by TaqMan\u00b1PCR assay and RT\u00b1PCR was compared. Viral RNA extracted from 10-fold dilutions of BVD virus strains was tested by one-tube and two-tube TaqMan\u00b1PCR and RT\u00b1PCR. Results were tabulated ( Table 2 ). The sensitivity of detection was equal with RT\u00b1PCR and two-tube TaqMan\u00b1PCR but onetube TaqMan\u00b1PCR was 10-fold more sensitive. Similar \u00aendings were observed with 10fold serial dilutions of BVD virus positive serum from a persistently infected cow diluted in sera negative for BVD virus. One-tube TaqMan\u00b1PCR method was shown to be 10\u00b1100fold more sensitive than the other two detection methods.\n\nA total of 20 BVD virus positive serum samples were identi\u00aeed by both microplate virus isolation and RT\u00b1PCR and stored at \u00c0708C for more than 2 years. After several freezethaw cycles, evaluation by TaqMan\u00b1PCR, virus isolation and RT\u00b1PCR were performed. Seventeen of 20 samples were positive by RT\u00b1PCR and virus isolation, but all samples were positive by TaqMan\u00b1PCR.\n\nTaqMan\u00b1PCR ampli\u00aecations were performed with serial dilutions of cRNA transcript prepared from NADL strain and Type II-125 strain (10 8 copies to 1 copy of RNA per reaction mixture). Fig. 1 shows the ampli\u00aecation plot with number of cycles versus DR n values for NADL strain. A detectable\u00afuorescence signal above the threshold occurred at 12 cycles for 10 8 copies cRNA transcript.

A linear standard curve was obtained from 10 1 to 10 8 copies per reaction mixture, resulted in C T values ranging from 12 to 37 cycles (Fig. 2) . The detection limit of the TaqMan/RT\u00b1PCR for cRNA transcripts was 10 copies per reaction mixture for NADL and 100 copies per reaction mixture for type II-125 at DR n 0:6. Samples with DR n values of 0.5 or less were interpreted as negative.\n\nRT\u00b1PCR has been reported to be a sensitive and speci\u00aec technique for rapid detection of BVD virus (Hyndman et al., 1998; Laamanen et al., 1997; Renshaw et al., 2000) . Quantitation of BVD virus by TaqMan\u00b1PCR described in this study has several advantages over conventional PCR. TaqMan\u00b1PCR is more sensitive and yields more information. Detection, classi\u00aecation and quantitation take place within one tube. The\u00afuorogenic probes simultaneously classify genotypes I and II BVD virus time consuming post-PCR analysis such as gel electrophoresis or hybridization procedures were omitted since the ampli\u00aecation of a speci\u00aec PCR product was measured during PCR cycling.\n\nTissue culture propagated viruses and validated \u00aeeld samples were used to prove the speci\u00aecity of the TaqMan\u00b1PCR assay. The speci\u00aec probes designed in this study correctly identi\u00aeed all reference samples and classi\u00aeed them into genotypes. Once the technique was optimized with validated reference strains and \u00aeeld isolates, the assay was applied to pooled positive serum samples and routine diagnostic samples. Sera collected from 80 herds across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania were screened for BVD virus by RT\u00b1 PCR and virus isolation. Pooled sera from 20 herds identi\u00aeed as positive for BVD virus by these two methods were also positive by TaqMan\u00b1PCR. Pooled sera from an additional 35 herds were screened for BVD virus by TaqMan\u00b1PCR followed by individual virus isolation only from positive pools.\n\nSome of the tissue culture propagated \u00aeeld isolates tested in this study were identi\u00aeed as both types I and II virus. Sequence analysis of the ampli\u00aeed 5 H UTR segment identi\u00aeed nucleotide variation that was intermediate between published types I and II sequences, suggesting there was hybridization of both types I and II probes. Further evaluation of these samples (NADC, IA) using nested PCR to a different segment of the 5 H UTR , were shown to be BVD genotype II. Result of both types I and II with TaqMan\u00b1PCR warrants further evaluation of the sample.\n\nThe comparison of TaqMan\u00b1PCR with conventional RT\u00b1PCR proved to be useful in assessing the sensitivity of the newly developed method. Ten-fold dilutions of tissue culture supernatants in DEPC water and BVD positive serum from a persistently infected cow diluted in negative serum were used to de\u00aene the sensitivity of the assays. One-tube TaqMan\u00b1PCR proved to be 10\u00b1100-fold more sensitive than two-tube TaqMan\u00b1PCR and RT\u00b1PCR. This was further proved using BVD positive diagnostic samples. After several freeze-thaw cycles, 3 of 20 BVD virus positive serum samples tested negative by virus isolation and RT\u00b1PCR, but were positive by TaqMan\u00b1PCR. False negatives were attributed to the degradation of the samples over time and the lower detection limits of RT\u00b1PCR and virus isolation.\n\nQuantitation of BVD virus reported in this study was sensitive and reproducible. Since 5 H UTR is the highly conserved part of the genome, the assay allows absolute quantitation of BVD virus in clinical samples. Quantitation of standards demonstrates sensitivity and precision of the assay for distinguishing between positive and negative clinical samples. While quantitation is not required for a diagnostic test, but is useful for several applications.\n\nThe prevalence of BVD infected cows within herds was reported to be 1.2\u00b12% (Houe, 1995) . Screening of each individual cow by virus isolation or RT\u00b1PCR is expensive. Testing of pooled sera was proposed as a cost ef\u00aecient approach for low prevalence (Munoz-Zanzi et al., 2000) . Single tube single enzyme RT\u00b1PCR evaluation of up to 100 pooled sera was validated as a useful method (Weinstock et al., 2000) . TaqMan\u00b1PCR is a more sensitive method to detect BVD virus in pooled serum samples. The positive pooled sera can be further tested in smaller pools followed by testing of individual serum by virus isolation.\n\nTaqMan\u00b1PCR offers several advantages over the other two PCR approaches: quantitative competitive RT\u00b1PCR where an exogenous competitor for each target is used as a control (Gilliland et al., 1990) , or semi-quantitative RT PCR where an endogenous housekeeping gene (for example, b-actin) is used as a control concurrently with the target gene (Kaufman et al., 1995) . TaqMan\u00b1PCR method is performed in a closed tube and requires no post-PCR analyses. Therefore, contamination with amplicons can be avoided. But contamination may occur during RNA extractions and pre-PCR preparations. Several quality assurance guidelines were instituted to avoid false positives. These include separate locations for sample preparation, RNA extraction and ampli\u00aecation procedures. In addition, each PCR run included positive and negative controls.\n\nIn conclusion, the TaqMan\u00b1PCR described here for detection, classi\u00aecation and quantitation of BVD virus has been shown to be sensitive and speci\u00aec. These features make it an excellent large-scale screening tool for individual or pooled serum samples. Rapid turnaround time, reproducibility and ease of use make this technique a valuable diagnostic tool for detection of BVD virus."}
