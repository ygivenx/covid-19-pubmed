{"title": "Measurability of the epidemic reproduction number in data-driven contact networks", "body": "The first quantities generally investigated in epidemic models are the incidence (of new infections) as a function of time and the associated growth rate of the epidemic. In homogeneous models, the number of new cases increases exponentially at a nearly constant rate r (5, 49, 50) during the early phase of the epidemic. This is not the case in the data-driven model, where we find a nonmonotonous behavior: an increasing trend over the initial phase of the epidemic occurs followed by a marked decrease about 20 d before the epidemic peak (Fig. 2A). Such a result is in sharp contrast with the classic theory, where the epidemic growth rate is expected to slowly and monotonically decrease over time in the early epidemic phase (Fig. 2A). This suggests that, in contrast to simple SIR models where the basic reproduction number can readily be defined through the relation R0=1+rTg (5), it is difficult to find a proper definition of the basic reproduction number in populations characterized by realistic connectivity patterns.\n\nThe daily effective reproduction number and generation time can be computed from the microsimulations by keeping track of the exact number of secondary infections generated by each individual infected at time t in the simulations (Fig. 1C). We find that R(t) increases over time in the early phase of the epidemic, starting from R0index=1.3 to a peak of about 2.1 (Fig. 2B). In contrast, in the homogeneous model, which lacks the typical structures of human populations, R(t) is nearly constant in the early epidemic phase and then rapidly declines before the epidemic peak (Fig. 2A) as predicted by classical mathematical epidemiology theory (4). The pattern found in the data-driven model can also be partly explained by the variation of the average degree induced by the infection of individuals with a higher number of adequate contacts [an effect already observed in heavy-tailed networks (51)], thus leading to an average growth of the reproduction number. The temporal dynamics of R(t) does not show a constant phase, implying that R0 loses its meaning as a fundamental indicator in favor of R(t). Although we report the results averaged over 50,000 realizations of the model, this result is supported by our analysis of the outcome of each single simulation, highlighting that the early time increase of R(t) is a common pattern in the performed simulations (SI Appendix, section 2.1). In Fig. 2C, we show an analogous analysis of the estimated generation time in the data-driven model. We find that the generation time is considerably shorter than the duration of the infectious period (i.e., 3 d in our simulations). The estimated average Tg over the whole epidemic is 2.67 d (\u224811% shorter than the theoretical value), with a more marked shortening right before the epidemic peak (Fig. 2C). This differs from what is predicted by the classic theory and the analysis of the homogeneous model (Fig. 2C), where the length of the infectious period corresponds to the generation time (6).\n\nA closer look at the transmission process in the different layers of the multiplex network helps in understanding the origin of the deviations of R(t) and Tg(t) from the classical theory (Fig. 3). Specifically, we found that the average degree of infectious nodes as well as R(t) tend to peak in the workplace layer (SI Appendix, section 2.2), and at least to some extent, the same happens in the school layer. However, R(t) generally decreases in the household and community layers (Fig. 3A). Indeed, R(t) in the household layer tends to be more uniform across the different nodes and thus, follows a general decreasing trend simply led by the depletion of susceptible contacts. We also found that, in the household layer, Tg is remarkably shorter than in all other layers (Fig. 3B)\u2014with an average fluctuating around 2.6 d, close to the value reported by analyzing real data for household transmission (26). To provide a simple illustration of the saturation effect in households, let us consider a household of three, with one index case and two susceptible members. If, at time t, the index case infects exactly one of the two susceptibles, then at time t+1, the index case has to compete with the other infectious individual to transmit the infection; the resulting generation time is shorter, simply because she/he cannot infect any other household member, although she/he may still be infectious. A similar argument was used in ref. 52 to explain why observed generation times are shorter than the infectious period. This evidence calls for considering within household competition effects when providing empirical estimates of the generation time (or serial interval) from household studies. Saturation effects are also responsible for shortening Tg in the other transmission settings, with the exception of the general community (Fig. 3B). All of the observed patterns of R(t) and Tg(t) are robust with respect to changes in the sociodemographic structure of the population (i.e., we simulated the infection spreading in both the Italian and Dutch synthetic populations), influenza transmission intensity (measured in terms of Rindex), and the distribution of the removal time (we tested exponential and gamma distributions). These analyses are reported in SI Appendix, sections 2.4\u20132.6.\n\nTo test the robustness of the results in a more realistic epidemic transmission model, we used the data-driven modeling framework to model the 2009 influenza pandemic in Italy. One of the characteristic signatures of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was the presence of a differential susceptibility by age (34, 53, 54); this is included in the model by using values estimated for Italy as reported in the literature (55). We also consider prepandemic immunity by age in the population according to serological data (55). Vaccination is not considered, as vaccination started only during the tail of the pandemic and had a very limited uptake in Italy (vaccination coverage <1%) (56). As in the previous section, the model has four unknown parameters: the four layer-specific transmission rates. They are calibrated through a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach on seroprevalence data by age collected in Italy before and after the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic (55). Model details are provided in SI Appendix, section 1.1.\n\nThe calibrated model is able to well capture the seropositive rates by age at the end of the pandemic (Fig. 4A). The estimated growth rate from the influenza-like illness (ILI) cases reported in Italy over the course of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic clearly shows an increasing trend during the early phase of the epidemic followed by a sharp drop about 3 weeks before the epidemic peak (Fig. 4B). The trend observed in the data is consistent with that obtained in model simulations (Fig. 4C). Fitting a linear regression model to the estimated growth rate over time in the ILI data results in an estimated coefficient of 0.064 (SE of 0.033), while the mean value obtained with a linear regression model of case incidence from all stochastic realizations is 0.064 (95% CI, \u22120.207\u20130.305). An increase in the initial growth rate of the epidemic has also been observed for other diseases and countries (57\u201359). Although alternative explanations may exist (60), our results provide a plausible explanation for these patterns based on the intrinsic structure of human contact networks. In terms of the dynamics of R(t) and Tg(t), the model calibrated on the 2009 influenza pandemic confirms the noticeable deviations of the data-driven model from the homogeneous modeling framework (SI Appendix, section 2.3).\n\nOur simulation results clearly highlight how the heterogeneity and clustering of human interactions (e.g., contacts between household members, classmates, work colleagues) alter the standard results of fundamental epidemiological indicators, such as the reproduction number and generation time over the course of an epidemic. Our results seem to be consistent in different countries (SI Appendix, section 2.4), suggesting that the observed patterns are due to the structure and clustering of human contact patterns rather than country-specific features. Furthermore, the analysis of alternative null models, such as degree-preserving and layer-preserving configuration models (SI Appendix, section 2.7), shows markedly different behaviors than those exhibited by the data-driven model, suggesting that the multiplex structure and the strong clustering effect typical of human populations, not captured by null models, are at the root of the observed behavior.\n\nOur numerical study questions the measurability of R0 in realistic populations and its adequacy even as an approximate descriptor of the epidemic dynamics. However, it is still possible to characterize the dynamics of an epidemic in terms of its effective reproduction number over time by estimating R(t) from the daily number of new cases by using Bayesian approaches (11, 17) (Materials and Methods). In Fig. 5, we show the comparison between R(t) as inferred from the time series of cases and R(t) resulting from the microsimulation data of the transmission chain for one stochastic model realization (other realizations are shown in SI Appendix, section 2.8). The overall good agreement between the estimated and actual values shows that it is possible to operationalize the estimation of R(t) to provide projections of the epidemic dynamics. The goodness of the obtained estimates depends on the knowledge of the distribution of the generation time (Fig. 5) and on the availability of a reliable time series of cases not markedly affected by noise and underreporting (10).\n\nThe analysis presented here takes advantage of \u201cin silico\u201d numerical experiments to open a window of understanding in the analysis of realistic epidemic scenarios. Although a lot of theoretical work has been done to define the reproduction number in nonhomogeneous models (19\u201324), a unified theory is still lacking. While we are not providing a theoretical framework for the computation/definition of the reproduction number and the generation time on realistic contact networks, we provide evidence that estimates of R(t) can be used to characterize the epidemic without resorting to untenable assumptions that may eventually mislead our understanding of the epidemic transmission potential and temporal dynamics.\n\nThe model considers a weighted multiplex network (38) G\u2192=(GH,GS,GW,GC), where H,S,W, and C represent household, school, workplace, and community layers, respectively. Let us define V as the set of all nodes, which is common to all layers, and E\u03b1 as the set of edges in layer \u03b1. We can thus characterize each layer G\u03b1=(V,E\u03b1) by the layer-specific adjacency matrix A\u03b1, where elements aij\u03b1=w\u03b1>0 if there is a link between nodes i and j in layer \u03b1 and aij\u03b1=0 otherwise.\n\nThis model assumes a single fully connected network. Following the notation introduced above, we have aij=w for each i and j, where w=1/(N\u22121) and N is the total number of individuals in the population.\n\nOn each of the introduced networks, we simulate the influenza transmission process as an SIR model. The SIR model assumes that individuals can be in one of the following three states: susceptible, infectious, and removed. Two types of transitions between states are possible: (i) from susceptible to infectious and (ii) from infectious to removed. The transition from susceptible to infectious requires a contact between an infectious individual and a susceptible individual. Specifically, given that, at time step t, node j is infectious and its neighbor node i is susceptible, the probability that j infects i (i.e., i changes its status from susceptible to infectious) is given by \u03b2=pw, where p is the transmission probability per contact and w is the contact weight. However, the transition from infectious to removed does not involve contact between individuals. Given that, at time step t, node i is in the infectious state, it has a probability \u03b3 to recover at time step t+1.\n\nFollowing the same approach used in refs. 11 and 17, we assume that the daily number of new cases C(t) at time t can be approximated by a Poisson according to the following equation:C(t)\u2248PoisR(t)\u2211s=1t\u03d5(s)C(t\u2212s),where \u03d5 is the generation time distribution and R(t) is the effective reproduction number at time t. The likelihood L of the observed time series of cases from day 1 to T is thus given byL=\u220ft=1TPC(t),R(t)\u2211s=1t\u03d5(s)C(t\u2212s),where here, P(k,\u03bb) is the probability mass function of a Poisson distribution (i.e., the probability of observing k events if these events occur with a known rate \u03bb). The posterior distribution of R(t) is then explored using MCMC sampling."}
