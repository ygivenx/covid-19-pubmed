{"title": "Self-assembled natural rubber/silica nanocomposites: Its preparation and characterization", "body": "Natural rubber (NR), one of the most important biosynthesized polymers displaying excellent chemical and physical properties, finds widely application in various areas [1] [2] [3] . Particularly, as an chemical-free biomacromolecule, natural rubber latex (NRL) has been used in manufacturing medical products such as medical gloves, condoms, blood transfusion tubing, catheters, injector closures and safety bags due to its excellent elasticity, flexibility, anti-virus permeation, good formability and biodegradability [4] [5] [6] . More recently, with the worldwide spread of the epidemic diseases such as acquired immure deficiency syndrome (AIDS), hepatitis B, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza A (H5N1), it becomes increasingly important and urgent to develop high performance NRL protective products.\n\nHowever, as its macromolecular backbone incorporates unsaturated cis-1,4-polyisoprenes, NR likes any other polymer is susceptible to oxidative or thermal degradation, particularly when formed into thin films. Once the degradation begins, NR readily becomes tacky and loses mechanical integrity. NRL products have, therefore, short shelf lives and life cycles. Though various anti-ageing agents have been successfully developed for dry NR products and limited anti-ageing agents for NRL were reported by using tris (nonylated phenyl) phosphite [7] and non-water-soluble amino acids [8] , no ideal anti-ageing agents have been identified so far for medical NRL products where strict safety and hygiene are required.\n\nLow tensile strength and poor tear resistance are the other major drawbacks encountered in NRL products, especially for medical gloves and condoms. Attempts have been made to use carbon black [9] , ultra-fine calcium carbonate [10] , modified montmorillonite [11] , silica [12] and starch [1] to reinforce dry NR or NRL. However, these traditional reinforcement materials are not so effective for NRL. Therefore, it is essential to exploit new way to enhance the ageing resistance and mechanical properties for NRL products.\n\nPolymeric/inorganic nanocomposites (PINs) represent a radical alternative to conventional-filled polymers or polymer blends, and exhibit a controllable combination of the benefits of polymers (such as flexibility, toughness, and ease of processing) and those of inorganic phase (such as hardness, durability, and thermal stability) [13] . Such an improvement in combined characteristics is particularly significant at low loading levels of nano-fillers, which do not significantly increase the density of the compound or reduce light transmission. Therefore, introduction of inorganic nano-fillers into NR matrixes to overcome the aforementioned disadvantages of NR has recently attracted enormous interest. Most of these are using clay minerals with a unique multi-layered structure to reinforce NR via melt-intercalation [14, 15] , latex-compounding [16] and solution-mixing methods [17] . It was found that the organically modified clays with a loading up to 10 wt% have a good reinforcement on the NR matrix due to the intercalation/exfoliation of silicates and formation of a skeleton silicate network in NR matrix [15, 16] . Nair et al. [18] [19] [20] also used nano crab chitin whiskers to reinforce NR. It was found that there is a three-dimensional chitin network within the NR matrix, which results in significantly improved solvent resistance and mechanical properties.\n\nThe high reinforcing efficiency of layered silicate rubber nanocompsites, even at low loading of layered silicates, is largely due to the nanoscale dispersion (the thickness of the layered silicates is 1 nm) and the very high aspect ratio of the silicate platelets (length-to-thickness ratio up to 2000). However, using fillers with higher specific surface such as spherical inorganic nanoparticles to directly reinforce NR, which has the potential to further improve the material properties, has not been reported. This is probably because there is no effective process to prevent the strong self-aggregation of nanoparticles.\n\nIn our previous work, a novel self-assembly nanocomposite process was developed to prepare a bulk polyvinyl alcohol/silica (PVA/SiO 2 ) nanocomposites [21] [22] [23] . We found that the chemical and physical properties of nanocomposites, compared to the polymer host, were significantly enhanced. The improvement in the properties is largely due to the uniform distribution of SiO 2 nanoparticles and the strong interactions between SiO 2 and polymer matrixes. We recently extended this self-assembly process to prepare NR/SiO 2 nanocomposites and briefly reported its preparation and thermal properties [24] . In the present paper, we will systematically discuss the self-assembly mechanism of the SiO 2 and NRL particles, observe the morphology of the nanocomposite and microstructure of SiO 2 nano-clusters with SEM and TEM, and investigate the impact of SiO 2 on thermal/thermooxidative resistance and mechanical properties.\n\nNatural rubber latex (NRL) with a total solid content of 62% was purchased from Shenli Rubber Plantation (Zhanjiang, PR China), and was pre-vulcanised at room temperature for 2 days with the following formula: sulfur 1.5 parts per hundred rubber (phr); accelerator PX 1.2 phr; accelerator ZDC 0.8 phr; zinc oxide 1.5 phr; and an appropriate amount of stabiliser. Silica nanoparticles (average diameter: 14 nm; surface area: 200 m 2 / g \u00b1 25 m 2 /g) and poly (diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) (mol wt ca. 100,000-200,000; 20 wt% in water) were brought from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich, Louis, MO). Water was Milli-Q water (18 MX-cm). All experimental materials were used as received.\n\nIn our previous work [24] , we briefly reported a novel process to prepare NR/SiO 2 nanocomposites by combining latex-compounding and self-assembly techniques. Firstly, the negatively charged SiO 2 nanoparticles act as templates to adsorb positively charged PDDA molecular chains through electrostatic adsorption. Negatively charged NRL particles are then assembled onto the surface of SiO 2 /PDDA nanoparticles. Finally, the SiO 2 nanoparticles are uniformly distributed in NR matrix. The key procedure of this process is the encapsulation of the SiO 2 nanoparticles with PDDA and NRL layers, aiming at suppressing the self-aggregation of SiO 2 nanoparticle caused by strong particle-particle interactions.\n\nSpecifically, the nanocomposites was prepared according to the following procedures. The SiO 2 nanoparticle aqueous dispersion of 1 wt% was treated with an ultrasonic vibrator for 0.5 h, and its pH was adjusted to 10 with 0.2 M NaOH to obtain negatively charged SiO 2 dispersion. A fixed amount of positively charged PDDA solution (pH 10) with a ratio of PDDA/SiO 2 = 5/100 w/w was then dropped into SiO 2 dispersion with mechanical stir. To remove PDDA that was not effectively absorbed on the surface of SiO 2 nanoparticles and avoid the flocculation of NRL particles cased by the redundant PDDA, the ultrasonically treated SiO 2 /PDDA dispersion was centrifuged followed by rinsing with Milli-Q water. This step was repeated for 2 times. The rinsed SiO 2 particles were then collected and ultrasonically re-dispersed to obtain SiO 2 / PDDA aqueous dispersion.\n\nA fixed amount of NRL with a total solid content of 5% was treated with an ultrasonic vibrator for 0.5 h, and its pH was adjusted to 10 with 0.2 M NaOH to negatively charge the NRL particles. After that, the rinsed SiO 2 /PDDA aqueous dispersion was then dropped into NRL with different mixture rates (NR/SiO 2 = 99.5/0.5, 99/1.0, 97.5/ 2.5, 96/4.0, 93.5/6.5 and 91.5/8.5 w/w) accompanying gentle mechanical stir at room temperature to obtain uniform NRL/SiO 2 dispersion, which was then dried in a vacuum oven at 50\u00b0C to obtain NRL/SiO 2 nanocomposite films.\n\nScanning electron micrographs (SEM) of the nanocomposites were taken with a Philips XL 30 FEG-SEW instrument (Philips, Eindhoven, Netherlands) at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. The fracture surface was obtained by splitting bulk sample being quenched in liquid nitrogen. A sputter coater was used to pre-coat conductive gold onto the fracture surface before observation. Thin films for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were prepared by cutting bulk samples being quenched in liquid nitrogen. TEM observation was done on a JEM-100CXII instrument (JEOL, Peabody, MA) with an accelerating voltage of 100 KV.\n\nA Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 thermogravimetric analyser (TGA) (Perkin-Elmer, Fremont, CA) was used for thermal and thermooxidative decomposition measurement. In nitrogen, the measurement of the films (ca. 10 mg) was carried out from 100\u00b0C to 600\u00b0C at a heating rate of 20\u00b0C/ min. In air, the TGA analysis was carried out from 100\u00b0C to 700\u00b0C at the same heating rate. The flow rate of the car-rying gas is 80 ml/min. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was preformed on a Perkin-Elmer Spectra GX-I FTIR spectroscopy (Perkin-Elmer, Fremont, CA) with a resolution of 4 cm \u00c01 in the transmission mode.\n\nTensile test and tear resistance experiments were conducted on an Instron Series IX Automated Materials Testing System (Instron, Acton, MA) with a cross head speed of 500 mm/min and the sample length between the jaws was 35 mm, the sample width 10 mm and the thickness 4.5 mm. The measurement was done at room temperature.\n\nWhen nanoparticles are dispersed with polymers, a coreshell structure tends to be formed in which nanoparticles covered with polymeric chains under certain conditions such as those used for self-assembly. By employing this approach, Caruso et al. [25] developed core-shell materials with given size, topology, and composition. Han and Armes [26] and Rotstein and Tannenbaum [27] studied polypyrrole, polystyrene and silica nanocomposites, respectively, and also confirmed the formation of this core-shell structure. In the present study, SiO 2 nanoparticles act as cores or templates to assemble PDDA and then adsorb NRL particles to develop a bulk NR/SiO 2 nanocomposite. There are two electrostatic adsorption stages in this process ( Fig. 1 ) [24] .\n\nIn the first stage, PDDA, an extensively used self-assembling material, is positively charged at the pH of 10 (Scheme 1) [28] [29] [30] , and is adsorbed onto the surface of negatively charged SiO 2 nanoparticles at the same pH (Scheme 2) by using the electrostatic adsorption as driving force. However, due to a large difference in rigidity between SiO 2 and PDDA and the charge density of PDDA is significantly larger than that on SiO 2 , all of the former charges cannot form short-distance ion pairs with surface charges of rigid SiO 2 particles [30] . Therefore, the positive charge on PDDA cannot completely neutralized by the negative charge on SiO 2 particles during the assembly, and the SiO 2 /PDDA core-shell particles will appear positive and be ready for next assembly with negatively charged NRL particles. To avoid the flocculation of NRL caused by the introduction of high molecular weight water-soluble cationic polyelectrolytes, PDDA that is not effectively assembled with SiO 2 is removed by the rinse presented in experimental section.\n\nIn the second assembly stage, the NRL particles are negatively charged as the protein particles adsorbed on the surface of the NRL particles contain carboxyl and amino functional groups (described as P -COOH -NH 2 \u00de, which can be ionized in three different modes depending on pH value (Scheme 3). If the pH is lower than the isoelectric point of NRL (4.5-5.0), basic ionization will occur and NRL particles will be positively charged. Under isoelectric condition, NRL particles will remain neutral. As the pH used in the experiment (pH 10) is higher than the isoelectric point, acidic ionization is generated. NRL particles are, therefore, negatively charged. Again, under the drive of electrostatic adsorption, NRL particles are adsorbed onto the surface of SiO 2 particles that are covered with PDDA molecular chains in the previous assembly stage. Finally, the SiO 2 nanoparticles covered with PDDA and NRL layers are uniformly dispersed in NR matrix and dried (Fig. 1) .\n\nAt the first assembly step, the SiO 2 nanoparticles act as the core of the SiO 2 /PDDA core-shell structure. However, the core is not presented as individual SiO 2 nanoparticle, but as SiO 2 nano-cluster, which is evidenced by the SEM observation (Fig. 2) , where the spherical nano-cluster and its primary structure unite: single nanoparticles can be clearly observed. This structure is also confirmed by the TEM image (Fig. 3) , where the solid spherical SiO 2 nanoclusters with a diameter around 60 nm (presented as dark circle pies) are uniformly distributed in NR matrix.\n\nAccording to Rotstein and Tannenbaum [27] , the total number of SiO 2 primary nanoparticles in a cluster can be approximately estimated as \n\nwhere N is the maximum number of SiO 2 nanoparticles in a cluster with a packing parameter, e, of 1. R 1 is the radius of the SiO 2 nanoparticle (7 nm), and R 2 is the average radius of a cluster that is statistically measured from SEM images by using the following equation:\n\nwhere N i is the number of the clusters with radius R i . The statistical information of the size distribution and the average radius is summarized in Table 1 .\n\nCombining Eqs (1) and (2), the average N for each nanocomposite can be obtained (Fig. 4) . When a small amount of SiO 2 (0.5 wt%) is added, the N is around 80, while it gradually increases to 224 as the SiO 2 content increases to 4.0 wt%. It is clear that at low loadings the primary aggregations are generated. These primary aggregations are unlikely caused by the strong particle-particle interaction, but the adsorption between polymer molecular chain and SiO 2 nanoparticles, i.e. PDDA molecular chains adsorb quite a few separate nanoparticles to form nanoclusters in the stage of assembly. Therefore, the SiO 2 is not distributed in NR matrix as individual nanoparticles, but as nano-clusters. Similar assumption was found in polyethylene oxide (PEO)/silica nanocomposites. Gunb'ko et al. [31] reported that each PEO molecules could interact with many primary fumed SiO 2 particles to form small aggregates. We also observed this in the PVA/SiO 2 nanocomposites during the assembly between PVA and SiO 2 nanoparticles [21, 23] .\n\nHowever, a pronounced but interesting phenomenon has been observed: the nanoparticles aggregate greatly when the content of the SiO 2 nanoparticles is higher than 4 wt% (Fig. 8) and accordingly the size distribution of SiO 2 clusters increases significantly (Table 1 ). It is evident that secondary aggregations based on the primary aggregations are generated at high SiO 2 contents. A similar result was also found in PVA/SiO 2 nanocomposites where both primary and secondary aggregations were observed at a SiO2 content higher than 5 wt% [21, 23] . However, without further information, we could not explain how and why the strong aggregation starts from this critical level. It will be investigated in our future work, as excessive particle aggregation will generally deteriorate the properties of the composites, and understanding the dispersion and aggregation mechanism during assembly is therefore critical for designing and synthesizing composites with stable behaviors.\n\nWhen the SiO 2 content is less than 4 wt%, almost all SiO 2 nanoparticles are homogenously distributed throughout the NR matrixes as individual spherical nano-clusters, but further increase in the SiO 2 content will lead to intensive aggregations. This can be observed from Fig. 5 , which shows the morphology of the NR/SiO 2 nanocomposites with different SiO 2 contents. The dark phase represents the NR matrix and the bright phase corresponds to the SiO 2 particles, which are strongly embedded by NR matrix. The higher the SiO 2 content is, the more severe the aggregation can be observed. There is no obvious phase separation observed, implying the good miscibility between NR and SiO 2 that are treated with self-assembly process.\n\nWhen only a very small amount of SiO 2 is added to the NR matrix (less than 1.0 wt%), most of the spherical clusters of nanoparticles are individually distributed amongst the NR matrixes (Fig. 5a) . When more SiO 2 nanoparticles are loaded, the density of the SiO 2 clusters becomes higher. The SiO 2 clusters start aggregation in some areas for the nanocomposite with the SiO 2 content of 4 wt%, where the mixing is not appropriately done (Fig. 5b) . When the SiO 2 is further increased to 6.5 wt%, the SiO 2 clusters are being aggregated in most areas. The aggregation dominates when the SiO 2 loading reaches 8.5 wt%. From the SEM micrograph with a lower magnification, the stratiform-like SiO 2 aggregation can be clearly observed (Fig. 5c) .\n\nFrom the statistical data, it can be seen that the size of the SiO 2 clusters has a very narrow distribution when the SiO 2 content is less than 4.0 wt% ( Table 1) . As more SiO 2 is added, the size distribution becomes significantly broader. Similarly, the average diameter of the SiO 2 clusters is quite stable (<85 nm) as SiO 2 is less than 4.0 wt%, it then markedly increases with the further addition of [32] and other physical blending [33] . However, silica has a number of hydroxyl groups on the surface, which results in the strong filler-filler or particle-particle interactions, and therefore has strong self-aggregation nature. In such conditions, the fumed SiO 2 nanoparticles tend to form loosely agglomerates that are dispersed with an average size in the range 300-400 nm, and these aggregated particles cannot be broken down by the shear forces during melt compounding [32] . Compared to other physical blending process, the process in the current work possesses sig-nificant advantages, as the size of SiO 2 is only around 85 nm.\n\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirms the presence of SiO 2 in the NR host, and identifies the interaction between NR and SiO 2 phases. As presented in Fig. 6 , in addition to the characterization peaks of NR at 1375 cm \u00c01 and 835 cm \u00c01 , the Si-O stretching vibration at 1100 cm \u00c01 and bending vibration at 475 cm \u00c01 [34, 35] are also presented in the spectra of NR/SiO 2 nanocomposite, verifying the successful incorporation of the silica nanostructure into NR matrix. The shift of the peak at 3450 cm \u00c01 was frequently used to study the hydrogen bonding between the -OH groups in the SiO 2 network and other functional groups from polymer molecular chains [36, 37] , and the shift of peak at the 1100 cm \u00c01 , and the Si-O bending vibration at 476 cm \u00c01 are the evidence of other interactions. Comparing to other polar rubber/silica systems [38, 39] , the above Si-O and -OH vibrating peak of SiO 2 shows a less significant shift. This means that the interaction between the NR macromolecular chains and SiO 2 is rather low when polar silica is distributed in the non-polar hydrocarbon rubber.\n\nThe thermal and thermooxidative ageing resistance of NR/SiO 2 nanocomposite can be assessed, respectively, from the investigation of thermal and thermooxidative decomposition. Fig. 7 are the TG and DTG curves of the pure NR and NR/SiO 2 nanocomposites in nitrogen. There is only one obvious thermal decomposition step of NR molecular chains, primarily initiated by thermal scissions of C-C chain bonds accompanying a transfer of hydrogen at the site of scission.\n\nThe thermooxidative decomposition is obviously different from the thermal decomposition as shown in Fig. 8 , which are the TG and DTG curves of the pure NR and NR/SiO 2 nanocomposites in air, respectively. The first large decomposition peak is caused by oxidative dehydrogenation accompanying hydrogen abstraction, while the second weak peak is resulted from the oxidative reaction of residual carbon. When SiO 2 is introduced into NR matrix, the main decomposition peak shifts to a higher temperature and is gradually divided into two peaks. As more SiO 2 is added (>6.5 wt%), the side peak becomes sharper, suggesting that the thermooxidative decomposition of the NR/SiO 2 nanocomposites should be more complex than that of NR. However, without further information, the role of the SiO 2 in the thermooxidative decomposition of NR/SiO 2 nanocomposite is not clear.\n\nTo reveal its thermal and thermooxidative decomposition mechanism, another investigation on thermal and thermooxidative decomposition of NR/SiO 2 using thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR), and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/massspectroscopy (Py-GC/MS) is being conducted and the results will be reported. The DTG curve shows the maximum rate of weight loss, so the peak temperatures of decomposition (T p ) can be determined. The onset temperatures of decomposition (T o ) can be calculated from the TG curves by extrapolating from the curve at the peak of degradation back to the initial weight of the polymer. Similarly, the end temperature of degradation (T f ) can be calculated from the TG curves by extrapolating from the curve at the peak of degradation forward to the final weight of the polymer. The temperature range of the thermal degradation, an important parameter to evaluate the degree of degradation, is expressed as DT = T p \u00c0 T o . These characteristic temperatures are summarized in Table 2 .\n\nDuring thermal decomposition, T o , T p and T f all increase with SiO 2 content and are relatively stable at the SiO 2 content of 4.0 wt%, where T o , T p and T f of the NR/ SiO 2 nanocomposites increase 10.4\u00b0C, 10.3\u00b0C and 12.2\u00b0C compared to those of the pure NR, respectively.\n\nSimilar to the thermal decomposition, T o , T p and T f of NR/SiO 2 nanocomposites during thermooxidative decomposition increase 13.6\u00b0C, 21.9\u00b0C and 22.7\u00b0C at SiO 2 content of 4.0 wt%, in comparison with those of the pure NR, respectively. In addition, the DT for pure NR is smaller than that of the NR/SiO 2 nanocomposites, which means the chain scissions for the pure NR last for a shorter time. These significant increases in decomposition temperatures indicate that the thermal and thermooxidative ageing resistance of the NR/SiO 2 nanocomposite has been markedly improved.\n\nThe thermal and thermooxidative ageing resistance of prepared nanocomposite is dominated by the distribution of SiO 2 nanoparticles. Since the SiO 2 nanoparticles are homogenously distributed in NR matrix as nano-clusters when SiO 2 content is less than 4.0 wt%, the SiO 2 and NR molecular chains strongly interact through various effects such as the branching effect, nucleation effect, size effect, and surface effect. Therefore, the diffusion of decomposition products from the bulk polymer to gas phase is slowed down. Consequently, the nanocomposite has a more complex decomposition and a pronounced improvement of ageing resistance compared to the pure NR. With the further addition of SiO 2 , the self-aggregation of SiO 2 is generated due to it being supersaturated and undoubtedly, the interaction density between SiO 2 and NR molecular chains decreases. Therefore, the ageing resistance of the nanocomposite cannot be further improved.\n\nAnother reason for the improvement in ageing resistance of NR/SiO 2 nanocomposites is that inorganic nanoparticles will migrate to the surface of the composites at elevated temperatures because of its relatively low surface potential energy [40] . This migration results in the formation of a SiO 2 /NR char, which acts as a heating barrier to protect the NR inside. Similar result was found in Gilman [41] and Vyazovkin's [42] work where a clay/polymer char greatly enhances the thermal resistance of the host polymers.\n\nThe incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles into elastomer matrix leads to a significant improvement in the mechanical properties of the host elastomer. Table 3 lists the mechanical properties of the pure NR and NR/SiO 2 nanocomposites with different SiO 2 loadings. NR, as a typical elastomer, shows an excellent flexibility and low rigidity. Because of the effective reinforcement of SiO 2 , a dramatic improvement in the tensile strength is found as well as tensile modulus at different elongations. The elongation is just focused on 100%, 200% and 300%, as the filler-polymer interactions play a critical role at a low elongation, while at a high elongation the strain-reduced crystallisation of NR dominates the elongation [15] . The tensile strength and modules increase with the silica loading when less than 4 wt% SiO 2 is loaded. Even incorporating a small amount of SiO 2 (0.5 wt%) gives a remarkable enhancement in the tensile strength and modules, which reach a peak simultaneously at SiO 2 content of 4 wt%.\n\nHowever, with further addition of SiO 2 , the tensile strength and modules gradually decrease due to SiO 2 aggregation.\n\nAnother noticeable improvement is observed in tear resistance. Poor tear resistance is one of the major problems for NRL product. Introducing SiO 2 into NR can significantly improve its tear resistance. The tear strength increases with an increasing SiO 2 loading. At SiO 2 content of 6.5 wt%, the tear strength (70.7 kN/m) is almost doubled that of the pure NR (37.1 kN/m). When inorganic nanofillers are homogenously distributed in polymer matrixes, they will macroscopically form an inorganic network, which mutually penetrates with polymer matrix and restricts the slides of polymer molecules, and therefore increases the mechanical properties of polymer hosts including tear resistance. However, the tear strength receives a significant decrease at the SiO 2 content of 8.5 wt%, as severe self-aggregation of SiO 2 are generated and the tear resistance of the NR host cannot increase but reduce.\n\nHowever, the SiO 2 reduces the flexibility of NR due to the restriction in the molecular chain slipping along the filler surface. The influence of SiO 2 on NR's elongation at break seems relatively unnoticeable at low SiO 2 loading (less than 2.5 wt%), while it plays a critical role at high SiO 2 . Particularly, the sample with the silica content of 8.5 wt% shows an extremely small elongation at break (384%) compared to that (995%) of the pure NR.\n\nSimilar to the thermal resistance, the improvement in various mechanical properties also shows a strong dependence on the morphology of composite. The better the SiO 2 dispersion, the better the properties of the nanocomposites as most of the mechanical properties peak at SiO 2 loading of 4 wt%, which is the turning point where heavy particle aggregations begin. \n\nThe self-assembly nanocomposite process has been successfully used to prepare a natural rubber/silica nanocomposite. When SiO 2 content is less than 4.0 wt%, by employing PDDA as an inter-medium, the SiO 2 nanoparticles are assembled with NRL particles as core-shell structure with slight primary aggregation, and the average size of SiO 2 nano-clusters is ranged from 60 to 85 nm. As more SiO 2 is loaded, heavy secondary aggregation of SiO 2 is gradually generated.\n\nIn comparison with pure NR, thermal and thermooxidative ageing resistances of prepared nanocomposite are significantly improved. During the thermal and thermooxidative decomposition, various characteristic temperatures of the NR/SiO 2 nanocomposites increase 10-25\u00b0C over those of the pure NR.\n\nThe tensile strength, tensile modulus as well as tear strength of the resulting nanocomposite receive markedly increases at SiO 2 loadings of 2.5-4 wt%. The influence of SiO 2 on NR's flexibility is relatively samll at low SiO 2 loading, while it plays a critical role at high SiO 2 in reducing the elongation. The improvement in ageing resistances and mechanical properties are all dominated by the distribution of SiO 2 nanoparticles. The better the dispersion of SiO 2 , the greater the improvement in the thermal and mechanical properties."}
