{"title": "Evidence of human coronavirus HKU1 and human bocavirus in Australian children", "body": "Acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) is a frequent cause of paediatric morbidity and mortality and a common reason for both outpatient visits and hospitalizations. Among humans, RNA viruses are the most frequent agent to cause the common cold, usually a self-limiting upper respiratory tract illness (Heikkinen and J\u00e4rvinen, 2003) . Viruses are also frequently associated with paediatric lower respiratory tract disease (Klig and Shah, 2005; Hayden, 2004) . Human rhinoviruses (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) are among the most commonly * Corresponding author.

Human coronavirus (HCoV) HKU1 was first described in January 2005 following detection in a patient with pneumonia. Further studies in an HCoV-SARSnegative population identified a single case. Apart from the two cases in Hong Kong reported in 2005, only one other instance of HCoV-HKU1 has been reported (Woo et al., 2005; Allander et al., 2005) . This suggested that the putative Group 2 coronavirus had a very low incidence (Woo et al., 2005) .\n\nMore recently, human bocavirus (HBoV) was described and tentatively classified as the first member of the family Parvoviridae, genus Bocavirus to cause disease among humans (Allander et al., 2005) . HBoV occurred in 3.1% of hospitalized patients and in 17.6% of these detections, a coinciding microbe was also present.\n\nPrevious studies at our hospital of patients with suspected ARTI have shown that the highest number of undiagnosed cases occurs during autumn to spring. We initiated an investigation of specimens collected over the late autumn and winter of 2004 for the presence of HCoV-HKU1 and HBoV using PCR.\n\nThe study population comprised 324 specimens from ill patients who had presented to Queensland hospitals or general practitioners during May to August 2004 with ARTI suspected of having an infectious aetiology. Specimens were predominantly nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA; 99.1%), but also included bronchoalveolar lavage (0.6%), and bronchial washings (0.3%) collected either at the time of visit or following hospital admission. The majority of patients visited the Royal Children's Hospital and Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospitals in Brisbane, Queensland. Consecutive specimens were retrospectively selected by season, without prior knowledge of patient details or microbiological status. The subjects comprised 59.3% males and ranged in age from 7 days to 86.0 years (mean = 6.8 years, median = 1.1 years, mode = 0.1 years), with children 5 years of age or younger constituting 79.9% of the study population.\n\nPrior to this retrospective study, specimens had been tested for common microbial respiratory pathogens and stored at \u221270 \u2022 C. The laboratory assays included a culture-amplified direct fluorescent assay and subsequent RT-PCR (Syrmis et al., 2004) to detect HRSV, human adenoviruses (HAdV), HPIV-1, 2 and 3 and influenza viruses A and B (IFAV, IFBV; (Syrmis et al., 2004) ). An additional RT-PCR assay was used to detect all four subtypes of HMPV (Maertzdorf et al., 2004) . Selective culture media were used to isolate bacterial pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus species, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria species, Staphylococcus species, Legionella pneumophila and Candida albicans. No microbes had been detected in 259 specimens (79.9%) while a suspected pathogen had been detected in 88 instances among 65 specimens (20.1%).\n\nSingle-tube RT-PCR and PCR amplifications (OneStep RT-PCR and HotStarTaq kits, QIAGEN) utilized 0.3 M of each primer for the pan-HCoV (Chiu et al., 2005, targeting ORF 1b), HCoV-HKU1 (Patrick Woo, personal communication), HCoV-OC43 (HCoVOC43 01.2, CGATGAGGCTATTCCGACTAGGT and HCoVOC43 02.4 TTTGGCAGTATGCTTAGTTACTT targeting the nucleoprotein gene) and HBoV (HBoV01.2, TATGGCCAAG-GCAATCGTCCAAG and HBoV02.2, GCCGCGTGAA-CATGAGAAACAGA targeting the NS1 gene) assays to examine 1 L of purified nucleic acid. Reverse transcription was performed at 50 \u2022 C for 20 min. PCR was preceded by 15 min incubation at 95 \u2022 C, then followed by 45 cycles of 94 \u2022 C for 20 s; 56 \u2022 C for 20 s and 72 \u2022 C for 30 s.\n\nAmplicon was purified directly from the reaction mixture (QIAquick, QIAGEN, Australia) and nucleotide sequencing reactions were performed on both amplicon strands by applying the ABI PRISM TM BigDye cycle sequencing kit (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems Division, USA). Sequences were determined using an Applied Biosystems 3130 \u00d7 l capillary electrophoresis (CE) genetic analyser.\n\nNucleotide sequences were aligned using BioEdit V7.0.0 (Hall, 1999) and presented in a topology tree prepared in MEGA 3 (Kumar et al., 2001) . The nucleotide distance matrix was generated using the Kimura twoparameter neighbour-joining method. Nodal confidence values indicate the results of boot strap resampling (n = 1000). Sequences for the HCoV-HKU1 ORF 1b and HBoV NS1 gene comparative phylogenetic analyses were obtained from GenBank (HCoV-NL63, AY567487; HCoV-229E, NC 002645; HCoV-OC43, AF124989; HCoV-HKU1, NC 006577; SARS-CoV, AY274119 and HBoV, DQ000495-6; canine minute virus (MVC), NC 004442; erythrovirus B19, NC 000883). Nucleotide sequences deposited into Gen-Bank as a result of this study include DQ190472 and DQ200648.\n\nWe investigated a population of 324 specimens predominantly collected during winter 2004, our peak months of viral ARTI, using a previously reported pan-coronavirus RT-PCR assay (Chiu et al., 2005) . Nucleotide sequencing of coronavirus-positive specimens determined two instances of HCoV-HKU1. Using HCoV-HKU1-specific primers provided by Dr. Patrick Woo, Hong Kong University (personal communication) we re-screened the population and detected an additional eight instances of HCoV-HKU1 infection from NPAs of children less than 4 years of age and one 40 year old adult, resulting in a prevalence of 7.5% of whom 66.7% were female. One co-detection, representing 11.1% of HCoV-HKU1 positive specimens, was detected in which HMPV and HCoV-OC43 were also present in the same 13-month-old male presenting with bronchiolitis. We next designed a new pair of PCR primers for HBoV diagnosis in order to avoid the non-specific amplification we noted when screening using a previously described assay (data not shown; (Allander et al., 2005) ). When investigating the same specimen population we detected 18 instances of HBoV from the NPAs of children less than 3 years of age (59.3% male) indicating a prevalence of 5.6% comprising 13.5% of all microbial detections.\n\nHRSV was the most frequently detected microbe in our population with 14.5% of specimens containing the virus (n = 47). HBoV was the second most frequently detected microbe followed by HMPV at 5.2% (n = 17) and HCoV-OC43 at 3.4% (n = 11). Seven instances of HCoV-OC43 (63.6%) were missed by the pan-coronavirus assay while one pan-coronavirus-positive was sequenced and found to be HCoV-229E, a target not included in this study. HCoV-HKU1 was the fifth most frequently detected microbe comprising 7.5% of all microbial detections and 3.1% of the study's specimen population. In eight instances, HBoV was the sole microbe detected and in two of these either bronchiolitis or viral pneumonia was suspected. In the remaining 10 instances, (55.6% of all HBoV detections) another microbe was detected, including eight instances of HRSV and one each of HAdV and HMPV type A2.\n\nChildren aged between 0 and 6 months (44.4% of all detections) were most at risk of infection by HCoV-HKU1, whereas children aged between 6 months and 2 years were the group most at risk of infection by HBoV. None of the 65 subjects older than 5 years were infected with HBoV whilst 1 HCoV-HKU1 infection occurred among this group.\n\nBoth viruses were detected throughout winter with HBoV occurring in late autumn but predominantly in early winter (61.1% of all microbial detections during June), and HCoV-HKU1 occurring solely in winter, predominantly late winter (55.6% of all detections occurred in August).\n\nDetailed clinical reviews of virus-positive patients were not performed in this study; however, clinical notes made at consultation described presenting signs including rhinorrhoea, fever cough and wheeze and disease manifestations including bronchiolitis and pneumonia that were consistent with ARTI.\n\nTo better understand the nature of the two viruses under investigation and to confirm our PCR results we sequenced eight HCoV-HKU1 and 10 HBoV strains. Phylogenetic analysis of Queensland HCoV-HKU1 strains indicated that a single cluster existed, but that it represented a second lineage when compared to the prototype Hong Kong strain. We propose the lineages be termed HCoV-HKU1 A and B (Fig. 1) . Queensland HCoV-HKU1 strains exhibited 97.5%-98% nucleotide and 100% predicted amino acid sequence homology with the prototype strain. Queensland HBoV strains (Fig. 2) shared greater than 99% nucleotide and 100% predicted amino acid homology with the HBoV prototype strains, st1 and st2. \n\nThis study presents the first evidence that HBoV circulates in ill children outside of Sweden, and that HCoV-HKU1 is present in patients in the Southern hemisphere, suggesting both are actively infecting humans on a global scale. Our data also describe the first detections of HCoV-HKU1 from children in a hospital environment and indicate that a recently published pan-coronavirus assay (Chiu et al., 2005) failed to detect 80% of HCoV-HKU1 and 63.6% of HCoV-OC43positive specimens.\n\nTogether, HCoV-HKU1 and HBoV comprised 21.1% of all microbial detections in our population, found in 8.6% of all specimens tested. These values are significantly greater than those reported in the original publications describing HCoV-HKU1 in Hong Kong and HBoV in Sweden. Our detections of these two viruses provided a putative aetiologic cause for ARTI in 16 previously undiagnosed subjects. Based on these data we recommend the inclusion of HCoV-HKU1 and HBoV testing in routine laboratory screening of children and adults with suspected ARTI during the colder months. Co-detections were not common with HCoV-HKU1 infection and our data strongly suggests that apparent respiratory disease may often be the result of infection by this coronavirus. By comparison, 55.6% of all HBoV-infected patients were also infected with another virus, most frequently HRSV, which is a well-characterised cause of mild to severe ARTI. In the original description of HBoV, Allander et al. (2005) reported that 17.6% of positives were co-detected with another virus namely one incidence of HAdV and two of HRSV. However, it was unclear what other microbial targets had been screened for in that population; therefore, it is to be hoped that future studies can contribute to this issue (Allander et al., 2005) . Currently neither HCoV-HKU1 nor HBoV can be associated with ARTI until more detailed, carefully controlled community and hospital-based studies are performed to elucidate the full spectrum of disease resulting from infection.\n\nThe region of the HBoV NS1 gene amplified during this study displayed limited sequence variation among Queensland strains, and additional epidemiological studies on different genomic regions will be required to investigate the overall stability of the viral genome. Conversely, examination of HCoV-HKU1 strains detected in this study showed these could be subdivided into two genetic lineages, A and B, encompassing 8-10 nucleotide differences over the length of the 414 bp amplicon (1.9%-2.4%) generated from the Australian strains that were absent in the prototype strain. HCoV-HKU1 B predominated during the winter of 2004. It remains to be determined whether these two lineages differ in disease severity among infected patients and whether additional variation will be seen elsewhere in the world.\n\nFurther investigation will be required to define an association between infection by HCoV-HKU1 and HBoV and respiratory disease. Such conclusions will be reached more rapidly if comprehensive studies can define the annual incidence of these viruses and the prevalence of infection within the broader community. Additionally, targeted studies are needed to investigate the role of these putative pathogens among the elderly and the immunocompromised. Nonetheless, we have shown that HCoV-HKU1 and HBoV both occur in children with suspected acute respiratory tract disease and that the two viruses contribute significantly to the total microbial burden at our hospital during winter. We recommend that HCoV-HKU1 be considered in the laboratory diagnosis of ARTI during autumn and winter and that further studies are needed to define the role of HBoV in ARTI."}
