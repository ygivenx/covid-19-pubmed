{"title": "Proteomic analysis identifies highly antigenic proteins on exosomes from M. tuberculosis-infected and culture filtrate protein-treated macrophages", "body": "The release of bioactive vesicles by one cell and its interaction with others expands the mechanisms of intercellular communication. Exosomes are one type of bioactive vesicle that has received considerable attention, as they are derived from the release of intraluminal vesicles upon fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane and therefore contain constituents present in the endocytic network [1] [2] . Moreover, exosomes are functionally diverse and known to be released from numerous cell types including cells of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic origin. Exosome release was originally observed in maturing reticulocytes and appears to function in eliminating non-essential proteins from the maturing red blood cells. Later studies demonstrated that exosomes derived from B cells and other antigen presenting cells were enriched for MHC class II, as well as co-stimulatory molecules like CD86 and could present antigens to sensitized T cells [3] . More recent studies have shown that exosomes carrying tumor antigens can promote antigen-specific T cell activation and tumor rejection in vivo [4] .\n\nTo better understand exosome function, immunoelectron microscopy, Western blot and mass spectrometry have been used to define exosome composition. These studies have identified common as well as cell-type specific proteins [5] . Moreover, the composition of the excreted exosomes can change when the cell of origin is exposed to different environmental conditions or to foreign material [2] . We found that exosomes released from Mycobacterium-infected macrophages carry mycobacterial antigens such as the 19 KDa lipoprotein and lipoarabinomannan [6] . The exosomes, which were released from mycobacterial-infected macrophages, induced a MyD88-dependent proinflammatory response in na\u00efve macrophages [6] .\n\nInterestingly, when exosomes isolated from M. bovis BCG infected macrophages were administered intra-nasally into na\u00efve mice they stimulated antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, suggesting that the exosomes contain a number of mycobacterial antigens [7] . However, the mycobacterial proteins present on isolated exosomes which could promote T cell activation were not defined in this study. Therefore, to address this question we established the first extensive proteomic analysis of exosomes isolated from M. tuberculosis H37Rv infected macrophages. Our analysis identified 41 mycobacterial proteins including some well known antigenic proteins such as ESAT-6 (Rv3875), Ag85 complex (Rv3804c, Rv1886c, Rv0129c), MPT64 (1980c) , and MPT63 (1926c). We also found that J774 cells incubated with M. tuberculosis (M.tb) culture filtrate proteins released exosomes containing a number of the highly antigenic M.tb proteins. Moreover, these exosomes could stimulate macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) activation in vitro and activate na\u00efve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vivo suggesting a possible use for these exosomes as a TB vaccine.\n\nBacterial culture, complement opsonization and M. tuberculosis H37Rv infection or CFPtreatment of J774 cells M. tuberculosis H37Rv stocks were generated as described [8] . Appropriate concentrations of mycobacteria were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Gibco) containing 10% normal horse serum as a source of complement components, followed by a 2 hrs incubation at 37 \u00b0C. The mouse macrophage cell line J774 was maintained at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO 2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies), 25 mM Na + -HEPES, 100-U/mL penicillin and 100-\u03bcg/mL streptomycin (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). Infection of macrophages with complement-opsonized BCG was carried out 3-4 hrs after seeding the cells and infected for 4 hrs as described [8] . For CFP-treatment, J774 cells were seeded in T175 tissue culture flasks and treated with CFP (20 \u03bcg/mL) in 20 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% exosome free FCS (6) . After 20 hrs, culture supernatant was harvested for exosome purification.\n\nBone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were harvested from the bone marrow of 6 to 8-week-old Balb/C mice as described previously [7] . Mature BMDCs were harvested and stored at \u2212140\u00b0C. To evaluate the IL-12p40 secretion by BMDCs following exosome treatment, BMDCs were thawed and seeded in 24 well plates at 1 \u00d7 10 5 cells /well in 0.5 mL of exosome-free culture media for 4 hrs and then treated with CFP exosomes or untreated (UT) exosomes at different concentrations. After 24 hrs, cell free culture supernatant was harvested for quantification of IL-12p40 by ELISA according to manufacture's instructions (Endogen, Woburn, MA).\n\nExosomes were isolated and purified as described previously [9] . Culture supernatants were collected 72 hrs post-infection from M.tb or from uninfected J774 cells. For purification of exosomes from CFP-treated and untreated J774 cells, culture supernatants were collected 20 hrs post-treatment. Exosomes concentration was approximately 2\u03bcg per ml culture supernatant. Culture supernatants were centrifuged at 300xg for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove debris. Cleared culture supernatants were filtered through 0.22-\u03bcm polyethersulfone filters (Corning, NY, USA). Exosomes are 30-90 nm in diameter and filter freely through 0.22-\u03bcm filters. Filtered supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000g for 30 mins at 4 \u00b0C and again at 100,000g for 1 hr to pellet the exosomes. Exosomes were further purified using a sucrose gradient where the 100,000g pellet was re-suspended in 0.5 mL of 0.25 M sucrose (20 mM HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.2) and layered on top of the linear sucrose gradient (0.25-2.0 M sucrose, 20 mM Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.2). The resulting sample was centrifuged at 100,000g for 15 hrs. Gradient fractions (7 \u00d7 1.5 mL) were collected from the top of the tube, diluted with 10 mL of PBS and ultracentrifuged at 100,000g for 1 hr. The purified exosomes from M.tb infected (M.tb exosomes), CFP-treated (CFP exosomes), uninfected cells (UI exosomes) or untreated cells (UT exosomes) were resuspended in PBS to a protein concentration of approximately 0.1 to 0.5 mg/mL as determined by a Micro BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Exosomes were sterilized by filtration through 0.22 \u03bcM syringe sterile filter (Millipore) and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.\n\nExosomes were administered to mice in three doses at two week intervals via an intranasal route. At each time point, C57Bl/6 mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and 30 \u03bcL volume containing 25 \u03bcg of exosomes from BCG-infected or uninfected macrophages, +/\u2212 30 \u03bcg CpG-ODN (Invitrogen) adjuvant in PBS were administered drop-wise to the external nares of mice (15 \u03bcL per nostril) using a micropipette. As a positive control, BCG was administered as a single dose of 1\u00d710 6 CFU/mouse in 30 \u03bcL of PBS via intranasal route as described above. Negative control groups received only CpG-ODN adjuvant in PBS.\n\nSpleens from BCG infected mice were isolated after 30 days of infection. For isolation of spleen and mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) from exosome-treated or untreated animals, mice were sacrificed two weeks after the final immunization and spleens and MLNs were aseptically removed. The spleens were then perfused with RPMI-1640 using 10 mL syringe fitted with 26G needle to obtain a single cell suspension of splenocytes. MLN cells were separated into single cells using the pistol of a 3 mL sterile dispovan syringe. The splenocytes and MLN cell suspension were then centrifuged at 300xg for 10 min. The RBCs were lysed by hypotonic shock using 3 mL ACK lysis buffer for 5 min. The cells were then washed thrice with RPMI 1640 to remove lysed RBCs and lysis buffer.\n\nLung lymphocytes from exosome treated and untreated as well as infected mice were isolated as described previously [7] with minor modifications. Pooled lungs were homogenized in 6 mL sterile complete RPMI-1640 in a glass homogenizer and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 hrs with type IV collagenase (125 to 150 U/mL) and DNase I (50-60 U/mL). Digested lung tissue was then pressed through a 70-mm nylon mesh and centrifuged at 300xg for 10 min. The cell pellet was then resuspended in complete RPMI-1640 media. The cell suspension was layered on a histoplaque and density centrifugation was carried out for 10 min at 300xg at room temperature. Lung mononuclear cells were obtained from the interface, washed, counted, and resuspended at a concentration of 10 6 cells/mL in complete RPMI-1640 media.\n\nTri-color flow cytometry was done for analysis of memory phenotype. Two weeks after the final immunization or 30 days after BCG infection, lungs, MLNs and spleen cells were isolated from exosomes treated and untreated animals. Cells were washed with FACS wash buffer and incubated on ice with panel of antibodies: antiCD4-PE, antiCD8-PE, antiCD44-PECy5, antiCD62L-FITC at the concentration of 0.5 mg/million cells in 50 mL of FACS buffer for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. Cells were then washed and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry. All the analysis was done with an acquisition of 100,000 events. Gating of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in the lymphocyte-rich regions was based on forward-angle light scatter and log Phycoerythrin fluorescence (FL2-H) and then the expression of CD62L (FL1-H) and CD44 (FL4-H) on CD4+ or CD8+ gated lymphocytes were analyzed. Cells stained with isotype control antibodies were analyzed at each time point.\n\nExosome pellets were resuspended and fixed in PBS containing 2% glutaraldehyde and then loaded onto Formar/carbon-coated electron microscopy grids. The samples were contrasted with uranyl acetate to visualize membrane, and viewed with a Hitachi H-600 TEM microscope (Hitachi, USA).\n\nMycobacterial components on exosomes were detected by Western blot. Briefly, 8 \u03bcg of exosomes were loaded into each well onto SDS-PAGE gels, electrophoresed, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PVDF) (Milipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were probed with appropriate dilution of monoclonal antibodies against GroES (SA-12), KatG (IT-42), 19 kDa lipoprotein LpqH (IT-12), CFP10 (\u03b1-CFP10), Ag85 (\u03b1-Ag85), GlnA (IT-58), and SodA (CS-18) of mycobacterial antigens. This was followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:25,000), and detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Roche Diagnostic, USA). All antibodies against mycobacterial components were obtained from Colorado State University, Colorado, USA, under TB Vaccine Testing and Research Materials Contract (NIH-NIAID NO1-A1-40091).\n\nSpleens were aseptically removed from CFP treated and control mice 2 weeks postimmunization. Single cell suspensions of splenocytes were generated as described above. The splenocytes suspension was then centrifuged at 300xg for 10 min. The RBCs were lysed for 5 min. in ACK lysis buffer. The cells were then washed thrice with RPMI 1640 to remove lysed RBCs and ACK buffer. Splenocytes from CFP treated and control mice were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates at 1\u00d710 6 cells/well in 500 \u03bcL of RPMI-1640 (supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM Lglutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin) in the presence or absence of CFP exosomes, UT exosomes and CFP at different concentrations for 72 hrs. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (5 \u03bcg/mL) was used as a positive control for cell viability. Cell free culture supernatant was harvested after 72 hrs, from which IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 levels were analyzed by ELISA, as per manufacturer's instructions using ELISA kit (Bioscience).\n\nFor Carboxy Fluoroscein Succinimidyl Ester (CFSE) labeling, splenocytes, MLN lymphocytes, and lung lymphocytes from CFP exosomes +/\u2212 CpG adjuvant, and UT exosomes treated mice were labeled with CFSE (2.5 \u03bcM), and 1\u00d710 6 cells/well were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates in 500 \u03bcL of RPMI-1640 (supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 \u03bcg/mL streptomycin) in the presence or absence of CFP (10 \u03bcg/mL). Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (5 \u03bcg/mL) was used as a positive control for cell viability. The cells were incubated for 72 hrs at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO 2 . Dilution of CFSE after 72 hrs was analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\nFor intracellular IFN-\u03b3, lymphocytes from spleen, lungs, and MLN were treated with CFP (10 \u03bcg/mL) for a total of 12 hrs with the final 6 hrs in presence of 2 \u03bcM monensin. These cells were first stained with anti-CD4-PE, and anti-CD8-PE, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with permeabilization buffer (Biolegend), and then stained with anti-IFN-\u03b3-FITC (Biolegend) according to manufacturer's instructions. The labeled cells were washed with FACS buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\nTo determine the most optimal method for the analysis of exosomal proteins, multiple methods were used, including in-solution digestion and in-gel fractionation prior to digestion. As seen in Table 1 , the in-gel methodology generated the most abundant highquality spectra. For this reason, exosomes purified from irradiated-M.tb infected and CFPtreated J774 cells were only processed via this protocol. In-solution analysis: 10 \u03bcg of each sample was added to breaking buffer to a final volume of 500 \u03bcL. Breaking buffer is composed of 50 mL of phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 (Gibco) with 1 mM EDTA, 30 \u03bcL DNase stock (1 mg/mL) and 30 \u03bcL RNase stock (1 mg/mL). Lysis of exosomes was achieved by sonication on ice with a micro-tip probe using 5 rounds of 60 sec pulses with 90 sec of rest between. The resultant lysates were denatured in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, reduced with 10 mM DTT and alkylated in 100 mM iodoacetamide. After overnight microdialysis in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, the samples were digested with trypsin (1:50, trypsin:lysate) in 10% acetonitrile (ACN) overnight at 37 \u00b0C. Digests were dried and resuspended in LTQ loading buffer (3% ACN, 0.1% formic acid in H 2 O). All digests were performed in deplasticized tubes to reduce plastic polymer contamination. Briefly, tubes were deplasticized by incubation with 600 \u03bcL 60% ACN, 0.1% TFA for one hour at room temperature, three times. In-gel analysis: 10 \u03bcg of each sample was separated on a 4-20% gradient Tris-Glycine 8 cm \u00d7 8 cm mini-gel (Invitrogen). Each lane was fractionated into 10 sub-samples and subject to overnight digestion with 0.5 \u03bcg of trypsin at 37 \u00b0C. Digests were stopped with 1/10 th total volume of 10% TFA. Peptides were extracted from gel slices using 2 rounds of 100 \u03bcL of extraction solution (60% ACN, 0.1% formic acid) at 37 \u00b0C for 40 min. The supernatant was then dried and resuspended in LTQ loading buffer (3% ACN, 0.1% formic acid in H 2 O).\n\nAn aliquot (1 \u03bcl; approximately 50 -100 ng/\u03bcl) of each sample was used for analysis by mass spectrometry. Peptides were purified and concentrated using an on-line enrichment column (Agilent Zorbax C18, 5 \u03bcm, 5 \u00d7 0.3 \u03bcm column, Agilent 1100 nanoHPLC,). Subsequent chromatographic separation was performed on a reverse phase nanospray column (Zorbax C18, 5 \u03bcm, 75 \u03bcm ID \u00d7 150mm column). Samples were eluted into a LTQ linear ion trap (Thermo Scientific) using a flow rate of 300 nanoliters/min with the following gradient profile: 0% B for 0-5 min, 0-15% B for 5-8 min, 15-55% B for 8-98 min, and 55-100% B for 98-103 min (A = 3% ACN, 0.1% formic acid, B = 100% ACN, 0.1% formic acid). This elongated method has been optimized to separate complex samples, such as whole cell lysate. Mass spectra are collected over a m/z range of 200-2000 Da using a dynamic exclusion limit of 2 MS/MS spectra of a given peptide mass for 30 s (exclusion duration of 90 s). Compound lists of the resulting spectra were generated using Bioworks 3.3 software (Thermo Scientific) with an intensity threshold of 5,000 and 1 scan/group. All samples were run in triplicate.\n\nDuring the initial injections, all ions were collected -however, due to the abundance of the mouse exosome proteins, an exclusion list was designed to eliminate the collection of the top 25 most abundant ions. This allowed for the collection and fragmentation of less abundant ions that would otherwise be suppressed. A comparison of the peptides identified from the in-solution and in-gel trypsin digests, with and without the use of the exclusion list, is included in Table 1 . While in many cases the exclusion list provided the identification of additional peptides, it rarely increased the number of protein identifications. Therefore, in subsequent experiments using exosomes purified from irradiated-M.tb infected and CFPtreated J774 cells the exclusion list was not used. \n\nIn order to calculate the FDR for each of the data sets, all .raw files were searched against a decoy database. Decoy databases contain a reversed version of the proteins included in either the customized database composed from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv FASTA file (for SEQUEST), as well as concatenated to the reverse IPI Mouse database (for Mascot). The resulting files were pooled in Scaffold and the analysis was identical to that described above. The number of proteins matched to the reverse database are as follows: Table 1 : 1 in the \"L ex \" sample, 1 in the \"G\" sample, 2 in the \"G ex \" sample and for Table 2 : 2 matches in the CFP exosome samples; these numbers are equal to the number of false positives (FP). The equation for the FDR is FP/(FP+TP), where TP is the number of total positives found in each data set (13 for L ex , 33 for G, 28 for G ex and 29 for the CFP). Therefore, the FDRs are 7.1%, 2.9%, 6.9% and 6.5% for the data sets L ex , G, G ex and CFP, respectively.\n\nAll in-solution and in-gel analyses for each sample were compiled in Scaffold (version 2.02.01, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR), in order to validate MS/MS based peptide and protein identification. The Scaffold program added another level of stringency utilizing the Peptide and Protein Prophet statistical analysis. Proteins and peptides were disqualified below a 90% threshold. [11] [12] . All proteins identified were subject to manual validation for final confirmation. False positives were identified using a na\u00efve exosome sample having no exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\n\nWherever applicable, data were analyzed using the Microsoft Excel Software program. Group comparisons were performed by using the unpaired Student's t test.\n\nExosomes purified from M. tuberculosis infected J774 cells were analyzed by EM and shown to have the characteristic spherical or cup-shape appearance and the expected size of 30 to 100 nm (data not shown). The isolated exosomes were also analyzed to confirm the presence of host protein components known to be present on exosomes (Supplementary Table 1 ). As expected we observed CD81, members of the annexin family, the ATPase \u03b1 3 subunit and integrins such as \u03b1 M and \u03b2 2 .\n\nWe previously observed that exosomes released from mycobacterial-infected J774 cells could activate na\u00efve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vivo [7] . To determine the mycobacterial protein components present on exosome that could serve as the antigens to promote the T cell response, we performed a proteomic analysis of exosomes released from M.tb-infected J774 cells. Tryptic digest of exosomal proteins was performed by both in-solution and in-gel to optimize mass spectrometry, as well as maximize protein identifcations. A total of 41 mycobacterial proteins were identified (Table 1, Supplementary Tables 2 & 3 ). In this group were a number of well-known M.tb antigens including the antigen 85A, B and C (Rv3804c, Rv1886c, Rv0129c), MPT64 (Rv1980c), and ESAT-6 (Rv3875) [13] . The presence of the 85A was particularly interesting as this protein is part of a subunit vaccine currently in clinical trial [14] . The presence of a number of well-known immuno-dominant M.tb antigens on exosomes (highlighted in table) likely explains our previous observation that exosomes from BCG-infected J774 cells can activate na\u00efve T cells when injected intranasally into C57Bl/6 mice [7] . Interestingly, the exosomes could stimulate this T cell response in the absence of adjuvant indicating that the purified exosomes have both antigenic and adjuvant properties.\n\nThe vast majority of mycobacterial proteins identified on the exosomes are known/predicted to be secreted [15] as shown in table 1. Most of the proteins are likely secreted via the SecA secretory system but some such as ESAT-6 are released through the newly described type VII secretion system present in mycobacteria [16] . Nevertheless, there are a couple of mycobacterial proteins present on exosomes that are not expected to be secreted including the succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (GabD1), an enzyme involved in M.tb intermediary metabolism.. This suggests that either there is some alternative mechanism for release of these proteins or that some mycobacterial lysis is occurring within the infected macrophage and subsequent transport of these proteins to MVBs and exosomes.\n\nTo confirm the results obtained through the proteomic analysis, exosomes were probed for a subset of proteins by Western blot. We found that exosomes released from M.tb-infected J774 cells but not from uninfected cells contained GroES (Rv3418c), MPT63 (Rv1926c), KatG (Rv1908c), 19 KDa lipoprotein/LpqH (Rv3763), antigen 85 complex (Rv3804c, Rv1886c, Rv0129c), GlnA (Rv2220), and SodA (Rv3846) (Fig. 1) . As expected both exosome populations contained the host protein lysosomal associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP-1). With the exception of the identification of LpqH and SodA, the western blot analysis is consistent with the findings observed through our shotgun proteomic approach (Table 1) . Due to the complexity of the exosome samples and the inclusion of murine proteins in the mass spectrometry analysis, it is likely that the LpqH and SodA peptides were either less susceptible to ionization or suppressed by the abundant host peptides. The benefit of this LC-MS/MS analysis was our ability to identify exosomal proteins without the need for additional detection reagents (ie antibodies), as well as discovering proteins that were not predicted. In addition, previous studies indicated that CFP-10 and ESAT-6 are secreted from the M.tb as a complex [16] and suggest that these proteins might also be in exosomes. While we observed the presence of CFP-10 by western blot, we found that exosomes released from infected J774 cells also contain ESAT-6 by LC-MS/MS (Fig. 1 , Table 1 ).\n\nSince our proteomic analysis indicated that the majority of M.tb proteins present on exosomes are known to be secreted, we hypothesized that the majority of these exosome proteins result from the release from the mycobacteria and not from mycobacterial lysis within the macrophage. To begin testing this hypothesis we treated macrophages with proteins actively secreted from M.tb (i.e. the culture filtrate proteins) with the anticipation that at least some of the mycobacterial proteins will be endocytosed and trafficked to MVBs and exosomes. This hypothesis is supported by previous studies where macrophages exposed to Toxoplasma gondii protein antigens produced exosomes containing a subset of these proteins [17] . We observed a similar finding as exosomes isolated from culture filtrate protein treated J774 cells (CFP-exosomes) contained many of the same proteins we observed in exosomes released from M.tb-infected macrophages including the antigen 85 complex, GroES, MPT63 among others (Table 1 and 2). In fact only 6 unique proteins were found in CFP-exosomes. This is not surprising since 95% of the proteins found in exosomes from M.tb-infected J774 cells have been experimentally shown or computationally predicted to be secreted (Table 1 ). In summary, 41 mycobacterial proteins were identified on exosomes from M.tb-infected J774 cells while 29 were identified from CFP-treated cells (Supplementary Tables 4 & 5) . Of these 29 identified proteins, 25 (86%) were identical to those observed from M.tb infected cells (Fig. 2) .\n\nJ774 cells were also infected with irradiated M.tb to evaluate whether macrophage-mediated degradation of M.tb results in significant transport of mycobacterial proteins to MVBs and release on exosomes. Despite the sustained level of exosome release from these cells compared to uninfected or M.tb-infected J774 cells, these exosomes were essentially absent of mycobacterial proteins (Fig. 2) . This may be due to the limited release of protein and lipid components from irradiated M.tb following phagocytosis.\n\nPreviously we reported that exosomes isolated from mycobacterial infected macrophages contain PAMPs and are pro-inflammatory. We have also shown that exosomes isolated from BCG or M.tb infected macrophages induced BMDC activation and maturation [7] . Since the exosomes derived from CFP-treated J774 cells contained a number of mycobacterial components we hypothesized that they may also stimulate macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) activation. As shown in figure 3 we observed TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 production by macrophages and DC respectively following treatment with CFP-exosomes.\n\nTo evaluate the antigenic potential of CFP-exosomes, splenocytes were harvested from CFP vaccinated mice and ex vivo stimulated with exosomes from CFP-treated or untreated J774 cells. As shown in figure 4 exosomes from CFP-treated J774 cells could stimulate spleenocytes to produce TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. Interestingly, when similar quantities of CFPexosomes or CFP alone were used, CFP-exosomes promoted a more robust TNF-\u03b1 response compared to ex vivo stimulation with CFP suggesting either an enrichment of molecules on exosomes that can stimulate TNF-\u03b1 production by splenic cells (likely macrophages) or more efficient presentation of these molecules to the splenic cells to promote TNF-\u03b1 production. The similar IFN-\u03b3 production by splenocytes treated ex vivo with CFPexosomes compared to CFP alone also suggest that either the exosomes contain the most potent M.tb culture filtrate antigens or that the exosomes are more efficient at transferring a limited number of M.tb antigens to antigen presenting cells for presentation to antigenspecific T cells.\n\nBased on the presence of prominent M.tb antigens on CFP-exosomes and our previous studies with exosomes from BCG-infected macrophages, we hypothesized that the exosomes from CFP-treated J774 cells could activate na\u00efve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vivo. To test this prediction, mice were administered intranasally with exosomes from uninfected or CFPtreated cells +/\u2212 adjuvant as described in Material and Methods and 2 weeks after the final vaccination the lungs, MLN and spleens were harvested. Single cell suspensions were stimulated ex vivo with CFP and the T cells were analyzed for proliferation, IFN-\u03b3 production and memory phenotype. As shown in figures 5, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells isolated from mice treated with CFP-exosomes showed increased production of IFN-\u03b3 upon restimulation with CFP and this was evident in all three organs. The adjuvant did not have a significant effect on the number of T cells which were positive for IFN-\u03b3 suggesting that exosomes contain both adjuvant as well as antigenic properties. This conclusion is supported by the data shown in figure 3 which indicates that exosomes from CFP-treated cells can promote DC activation. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells isolated from mice treated with CFPexosomes but not from mice treated with uninfected exosomes also showed increased proliferation when stimulated ex vivo with CFP ( Fig. 5D and E) . Previous studies indicated that antigen-specific effector memory cells may play an important role in protection against M.tb in BCG vaccinated individuals [18] [19] . Therefore we addressed whether effector memory cells were produced in mice vaccinated with CFP-exosome and found CD44 hi , CD62L low CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which is indicative of effector memory cells, in all three organs ( Fig. 5F and G) . Together, the data suggests that vaccination of mice with exosomes isolated from CFP-treated J774 cells can induce a profile of T cell activation often associated with M.tb control (i.e. IFN-\u03b3 production and effector memory cells).\n\nPrevious studies indicate that exosomes isolated from M.tb-infected macrophages can have immune modulatory activity [20] [6] . The exosomes activated both the innate and acquired immune responses suggesting the presences of multiple mycobacterial components. However, in these previous reports only the antigen 85 complex was identified. In the present study an MS proteomics approach was taken to identify the mycobacterial proteins present on exosomes released from M.tb-infected J774 cells. A surprisingly high number of mycobacterial proteins (i.e. 41) were identified along with a number of expected host proteins. Why the high number and why these particular proteins? Most of the identified proteins are known to be secreted by M.tb and some, including the fibronectin attachment protein) have been shown previously to be released outside the phagosome [21] . Recent studies have identified two major mechanisms by which proteins are targeted to the intraluminal vesicles of MVBs for subsequent release on exosomes. One involves ubiquitination of proteins which is recognized by the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery for subsequent trafficking and retention of proteins in the intraluminal vesicles [22] . A second mechanism appears to involve aggregation of membrane proteins forming microdomains which may stabilize the exosomal membrane domains [22] . Although we did not find ubiquitination motifs among the different M.tb exosome proteins we could not determine from our analysis whether these proteins are aggregating within the phagosome and subsequently trafficked through the endocytic network into MVBs. In addition to these known pathways there is some evidence to indicated that there may be ESCRT-independent transport mechanisms [23] but whether some or all of the mycobacterial proteins use these alternative targeting pathways must wait until the process is better defined. This is further complicated by the lack of studies addressing the mechanism of phagosomal protein trafficking to MVBs which may differ from how plasma membrane or endosomal proteins are targeted to MVBs and exosomes.\n\nIndependent of how mycobacterial proteins and other components are targeted to MVBs/ exosomes it is clear that this occurs during the course of an M.tb infection both in vitro and in vivo [6] . At the time of this publication no other study has defined the microbial components present on exosomes following infection with an intracellular pathogen. Some studies with HIV-infected macrophages and dendritic cells suggest that HIV may bud from cells through exosomes or exosome-like vesicles [24] [25] . Other studies have shown the HIV Gag protein, when expressed in cells, shows preferential targeting to MVBs and release on exosomes [26] . Studies by Raposo and colleagues have shown that prion protein (PrP) in both its normal and scrappie conformation are trafficked to MVBs and released on exosomes [27] . Prion diseases are fatal neurodegenerative disorders and the infectious forms involves transmission of the prion protein in its scrappie conformation to a susceptible host. The possibility that exosomes may promote the transfer of prion protein is an intriguing one.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that mycobacterial proteins, glycolipids, lipoproteins, etc. can affect the host immune system and can function to either promote an effective immune response or potentially inhibit aspects of this response [28] [29] . To what degree exosomes promote or inhibit immunity will likely depend on what mycobacterial components are present on the exosomes at any given time. The proteomic analysis of exosomes released from infected macrophages as described in this study is the first venture into dissecting their protein composition. Future studies will be needed to define how exosome composition may change over time particularly during the course of an in vivo infection and how this correlates with bacterial burden and the stage of infection. The eventual goal is to better understand exosome's role during the course of an M.tb infection. Nevertheless, our previous studies demonstrate that exosomes isolated from M. bovis BCG-infected J774 cells could activate both na\u00efve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells suggesting that under some conditions exosomes from infected macrophages can promote an acquired immune response. This also suggests that exosomes with the right subset of M.tb components may function as a viable vaccine candidate and the presence of highly antigenic M.tb proteins on the isolated exosomes support this possibility. Members of the 85 complex which are proteins found on exosomes were originally described as a prominent TB antigens in animal models and within infected humans [30] [31] . Subsequent subunit vaccine studies in non-human primates showed that this antigen along with another well-known antigen ESAT-6 provides protection against M.tb infection [32] . Clinical trials are presently ongoing using a Ag85B-ESAT-6 fusion protein as a subunit vaccine.\n\nSince we found a number of M.tb secreted proteins on exosomes released from M.tbinfected macrophages we tested whether incubating macrophages with these culture filtrate proteins exogenously would produce exosomes containing at least a subset of these proteins. Interestingly, we found 29 M.tb proteins on these exosomes. There are approximately 205 M.tb proteins in the culture supernatant [15] so our findings that 29 of these including ESAT-6 and the 85 complex are trafficked to MVBs and exosomes suggest an efficient transport mechanism. However, why these specific M.tb proteins are targeted is not known.\n\nAnother interesting observation was that the majority of these exosomal proteins (25 of the 29) were also present in exosomes from M.tb-infected macrophages. This indicates that these proteins are targeted to MVBs and exosomes independent of whether they traffic through the phagosome or through endocytic pathway. It is important to note that the M.tb is washed prior to the macrophage infection and there is no culture supernatant added to the cells at the time of infection. The \"feeding\" of proteins to DC, B cells or macrophages to produce exosomes containing the added proteins has been performed in the context of tumor antigens [33] [1] as well as microbial antigens from Toxoplasma gondii [34] , diphtheria toxin from Streptococcus pneumoniae [35] and spike S protein from the SARS-associated cornavirus [36] suggesting that this may be a mechanism to \"engineer\" exosomes to contain specific proteins. However, before this method can reach its full potential we need a better understanding of how proteins are trafficked to MVBs and exosomes.\n\nWe hypothesized that since these exosomes derived from CFP-treated J774 cells contained known M.tb antigens it could function to promote activation of na\u00efve T cells in vivo and our data supports this hypothesis. The number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells which produced IFN\u03b3 upon ex-vivo stimulation was comparable to our previous studies when exosomes from BCG-infected macrophages were used for vaccination [7] . The same held true for the production of effective memory T cells. The similar levels of T cell activation induced by exosomes from CFP-treated and BCG-infected macrophages suggest that in our mouse model they share the major antigens that are inducing the acquired immune response. However, which of these 25 shared M.tb proteins are the major contributors to the T cell response is presently unknown. Nevertheless, the exosomes derived from CFP-treated macrophages have distinct advantages over those generated from M.tb-infected macrophages with the major advantage stemming from the removal of a BSL3 pathogen infection from the exosome-generation process. Moreover, like the exosomes from M.tb infected macrophages, CFP-exosomes did not require adjuvant for activation of na\u00efve T cell in vivo and could promote DC activation and maturation in vitro. In contrast, CFP alone, although capable of inducing T cell activation when injected into mice, could only do so in the presence of adjuvant [37] . This is an important consideration since only Alum has been approved as an adjuvant for use in humans. Future studies will determine whether the CFPexosomes when used to vaccinate mice protects against an M.tb infection.\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.
