{"title": "Epitope-based peptide vaccine design and target site characterization against novel coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2", "body": "The SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus disease 2019; previously 2019-nCoV) has recently emerged as a human pathogen leading to 51,000 confirmed cases globally and at least 1,600 deaths [1] . SARS-CoV-2 virus is an enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA coronavirus with the genome size of approximately 29.9 kb.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 is closely related to several bat coronaviruses and the SARS-CoV virus [2, 3] , and all belong to the B lineage of the beta-coronaviruses [4] . The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 appears to contain the way from human to human and from contact with infected surfaces and objects, causing WHO declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on January 30 th , 2020 [5] [6] [7] .\n\nStructural proteins are important targets for vaccine and anti-viral drug development due to their indispensable function to fuse and enter into the host cell [8] . SARS-CoV-2 utilizes glycosylated spike (S) protein to gain entry into host cells. The S protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein and exists in a metastable prefusion conformation that undergoes a dramatic structural rearrangement to fuse the viral membrane with the host-cell membrane [1, 9, 10] . The S protein includes the receptor binding S1-subunit and the membrane fusion S2-subunit. The S1 subunit receptor-binding domain (RDB) is specifically recognized by the host receptor. When the S1 subunit binds to a host-cell receptor, the prefusion trimer is destabilized, resulting in the shedding of S1 subunit, and the state transition of S2 subunit to a stable postfusion conformation [11] . The critical function of the S protein can be a breakthrough in vaccine design and development.\n\nGreat efforts are being made for the discovery of antiviral drugs, but there are no licensed therapeutic or vaccine for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection available in the market. Developing an effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is therefore a research priority. It is time-consuming and expensive to design novel vaccines against viruses by the use of kits and related antibodies [12] . Thus, we chose the method of immune-informatics, which is more efficient and more applicable for deep analysis of viral antigens, B-and T-cell linear epitope prediction, and evaluation of immunogenicity and virulence of pathogens.\n\nAmong those can be analyzed, B-cell can recognize and activate defense responses against viral infection, T-cell and antibody reactions may recover extreme respiratory infection.\n\nIn this manuscript, we applied immuno-informatics approach to identify potential B-and T-cell epitopes based on the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The antigenicity of all the epitopes were estimated and the interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles were evaluated for MHC class-I epitopes.\n\nAllergenicity, toxicity, stability and physiochemical properties were also investigated for exploring the antigenicity, stability and safety of the identified epitopes. The conservation of all B-and T-cell epitopes were examined across all isolates from different locations. Some of these identified epitopes could be used as promising vaccine candidates.\n\npredict MHC class I binding T-cell epitopes for S protein. Peptide_binding_to_MHC_class_II_molecules tool of IEDB and HLA class II set [21] was utilized to predict T-cell epitopes for S protein. Percentile rank with threshold of 1% for MHC class I binding epitopes and 10% for MHC class II binding epitopes were used to filter out peptide-allele with weak binding affinity. The antigenicity score of each epitope was calculated by VaxiJen v2.0. A high stringent standard was used to filter peptides with antigenicity score larger than or equal to 1, the number of binding alleles larger than or equal to 3 for MHC class I binding epitopes and 5 for MHC class II binding epitopes.\n\nAll selected B-cell and MHC class I and II binding T cell epitopes were examined for their allergenicity, hydro and physiochemical features, toxicity and digestion. Allergenicity of B-cell and T-cell epitopes were assessed by Allergen FP 1.0 (http://ddg-pharmfac.net/AllergenFP/). Toxicity of B-cell and T-cell epitopes along with hydrophobicity, hydropathicity, hydrophilicity and charge were evaluated by ToxinPred (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/toxinpred/index.html). The peptides that can be digested by several enzymes are usually non-stable, while the peptides digested by fewer enzymes are more stable, so that those are more favorable vaccine candidates. Examined by protein digest server (http://db.systemsbiology.net:8080/proteomicsToolkit/proteinDigest.html), the digestion of B-and T-cell epitopes by 13 enzymes including Trypsin, Chymotrpsin, Clostripain, Cyanogen Bromide, IodosoBenzoate, Proline Endopept, Staph Protease, Trypsin K, Trypsin R, AspN, Chymotrypsin (modified), Elastase, and Elastase/Trypsin/Chymotryp.\n\nThe 3D structure of human HLA-B35:01(PDB ID: 1A9E) at a resolution of 2.5 \u00c5, HLA-B*51:01 (PDB ID: 1E27) at a resolution of 2.2 \u00c5 and HLA-B*53:01 (PDB ID: 1A1O) at a resolution of 2.3 \u00c5 were downloaded from protein databank (RCSB PDB) and used for evaluating their interactions with selected epitopes. Protein-peptide interactions were performed by PepSite [22] with the top prediction chosen from a total of 10 epitope-protein interaction reports.\n\nThe S protein sequences were taken from an open access database NGDC (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/), where 134 SARS-CoV-2 virus strain sequences are documented from 38 locations worldwide. The mutations in the S protein are documented in 37 isolates. The phylogenetic tree of the S proteins with mutations were generated using MEGA software [23] . By performing the multiple-sequence-alignment against the S protein sequences collected from different locations, all the selected epitopes were examined for their variability and conservation.\n\nThe physiochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 S protein calculated by Protparam demonstrate that it Secondary structure of S protein were generated by PSIPRED [14] , showing that Beta strand (26. Table 2 ). Antigenicity analysis of the full-length protein confirmed that S protein was an expected antigen with antigenicity score of 0.4646 by Vaxijen. The transmembrane protein topology predicted by TMHMM showed that residues from 1 to 1213 were exposed on the surface, residues from 1214 to 1236 were inside transmembrane-region and residues from 1237 to 1273 were within the core-region of the S protein (Fig. 1A) .\n\n.

B-cell epitopes of S protein were predicted using IEDB [17] . A total of 23 and 26 linear epitopes (Supplementary Table 3a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.965434 doi: bioRxiv preprint abundance in known B-cell epitopes. The antigenic tendency value of S protein was estimated to be 1.041 (average), 0.866(minimum) and 1.261 (maximum) (Fig. 1B) . Hydrophilic region is important in initiating immune response, which is generally uncovered on the surface of protein. Parker hydrophilicity of S protein was found to be 1.238 (average), -7.629 (minimum) and 7.743 (maximum) (Fig. 1C) . To find the surface availability of B-cell epitopes, Emini surface accessibility was predicted for S protein with average of 1 , minimum of 0.042, and maximum of 6.051 (Fig. 1D) . Exposed on the surface and hydrophilic in nature making beta turn a vital structure in starting the defense response. Therefore, we predicted Chou and Fasman beta turn to gain the result, 0.997 (average), 0.541 (minimum) and 1.484 (maximum) in S protein (Fig. 1E ). As the parts of epitope connecting with antibodies are typically elastic in nature, we predicted Karplus and Schulz flexibility of S protein and the result was 0.993 (average), 0,876 (minimum), and 1.125(maximum) (Fig. 1F) . A total of 262 B-cell epitopes were selected based on the combination of the results (Supplementary Table 3a ). BcePred [18] was used to predict B-cell epitopes using accessibility, antigenic propensity, exposed surface, flexibility, hydrophilicity, polarity and turns. Overall, we obtained totally 129 B-cell epitopes (Supplementary Table 3b ). Table 1 ). The four B-cell epitopes were mapped to the 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (PDB ID: 6VSB), showing that 'VLGQSKRVDFCGKG' and 'GLTGTGVLTESNKK' are in less-exposed region (Figure 2 A, and B) , while 'VRQIAPGQTGKIAD' and 'KIADYNYKLPDDFT' locate in the spike head which is the most exposed region (Figure 2 C) . Discontinuous B-cell epitopes were predicted by Discotope 2.0 using A, B, and C chain of 3D structure of S protein (PDB ID: 6VSB), respectively. The positions of discontinuous epitopes were mapped on the surface of 3D structure of S protein ( Figure 3A ). Most discontinuous B-cell epitopes were mapped on the fully-exposed 'spike head' region ( Figure 3B ) and less-exposed 'spike stem', while a few located in the 'spike root' region of the spike (Supplementary Table 3c ).\n\n.

Toxicity, hydrophobicity, hydropathicity, hydrophilicity and charge of B-cell epitopes were examined by a support vector machine (SVM) based method, ToxinPred. The result demonstrates that all of B-cell epitopes were predicted to be non-toxin (Table 2a) . The stability of B-cell epitopes were evaluated through the number of peptide digesting enzymes by protein digest server. All B-cell epitopes were found to have multiple non-digesting enzymes varying from 4 to 7 enzymes (Table 2b) .\n\nPeptide_binding_to_MHC_class_I_molecules tool of IEDB and HLA class I set [20] was utilized to predict T-cell epitopes for S protein. Percentile rank with threshold of 1% was used to filter out peptideallele with weak binding affinity. The antigenicity score of each peptide was calculated by VaxiJen v2.0 to evaluate its antigenicity. A peptide having both high antigenicity score and capacity to bind with larger number of alleles is considered to have high potentials to initiate a strong defense response. High stringent criteria were used to filter peptides with antigenicity score larger than or equal to 1 and the number of binding alleles larger than or equal to 3. Utilizing the evaluating method above, we obtained a total of 9 MHC class-I allele binding peptides ( Table 3) Peptide_binding_to_MHC_class_II_molecules tool of IEDB and HLA class II set [21] was utilized to predict T-cell epitopes for S protein. Percentile rank with threshold of 10% was used to filter out peptideallele with weak binding affinity. The antigenicity score of each peptide was calculated by VaxiJen v2.0 to evaluate its antigenicity. A high stringent standard was used to filter peptides with antigenicity score larger than or equal to 1 and the number of binding alleles larger than or equal to 5. As a result, we obtained a total of 13 MHC class-II allele binding peptides ( \n\nAllergenicity of T-cell epitopes were assessed by Allergen FP 1.0. Results showed that two of nine MHC class-I binding peptides were probably non-allergen, and nine of thirteen MHC class-II binding peptides were predicted to be non-allergen ( Table 5 ). Toxicity of T-cell epitopes along with hydrophobicity, hydropathicity, hydrophilicity and charge were evaluated by ToxinPred. All of T-cell epitopes were predicted to be non-toxin (Table 5 ). The stability of T-cell epitopes were evaluated through the number of peptide digesting enzymes by protein digest server. All T-cell epitopes were found to have multiple nondigesting enzymes varying from 4 to 11 enzymes ( Table 6 ).\n\nProtein-peptide interactions are critical in cellular signaling pathways. Two MHC class-I binding epitopes, 'LPIGINITRF' and 'IAIVMVTIM', were predicted to be non-allergic and non-toxic. Both epitopes were The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.25.965434 doi: bioRxiv preprint Figure 5 . Phylogenetic tree illustrating evolutionary relationships among SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different locations worldwide.\n\nThe emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is a serious health threat for the whole society, thus there is an urgent need for drugs and preventative measures. The SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by lung infections with symptoms including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Based on the information from CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), the symptoms can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure to the virus which can transmit from human to human or from contact with infected surfaces and objects [5] [6] [7] .\n\nIt is critical to rapidly identify immune epitopes. The S protein is of crucial in the fuse and entry of virus into host cells [1] , therefore it is a primary target for neutralizing antibodies. The specificity of epitopebased vaccines can be enhanced by selecting parts of S protein exposed on the surface [28] . Medical biotechnology is important in developing vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. However, computer-based immune-informatics can improve time and economic effectiveness, as a result, it is also an essential method in immunogenic analysis and vaccine development.\n\nIn this study, we characterized the physio-chemical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome for epitope candidates and adopted an immune-informatics based pipeline with highly stringent criteria to identify S protein targeted B-and T-cell epitopes that may potentially promote an immune response in the host. The antigenicity, flexibility, solvent accessibility, disulphide bonds of predicted epitopes were evaluated, yielding four potential B-cell epitope and vaccine candidate. Allergenicity and toxicity analysis confirmed the four B-cell epitopes are of non-allergen and non-toxin. Stability analysis revealed that they can not be digested by multiple enzymes. In addition, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding Tcell epitopes were predicted to interact with numerous HLA alleles and to be highly antigenic in nature.\n\nAllergenicity, toxicity, and physiochemical properties of T-cell epitopes were analyzed to increase specificity and selectivity. The stability and safety were confirmed by digestion analysis. All selected Band T-cell (MHC class-I and II) epitopes were conserved in all isolates of different locations globally without mutations observed yet.\n\nWe predict the B-and T-cell epitopes identified here may assist the development of potent peptide-based vaccines to address the SARS-CoV-2 challenge. But the replication of SARS-CoV-2 must be error-prone, which is similar to SARS-CoV with reported mutation rate of 4x10 -4 substitutions/site/year [29] . Antiviral vaccines are necessary to be developed before the predicted epitopes are potentially obsolete. In addition, our immune-informatics based pipeline also provides a framework to identify B-and T-cell epitopes having therapeutic potential with excellent scope for SARS-CoV-2, but not limited to specific virus.\n\nThe authors declare no potential conflicts of interest.
