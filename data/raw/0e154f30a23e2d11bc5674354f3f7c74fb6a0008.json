We use such an estimated number of infections, to foresee the effects of restriction actions adopted by governments to constrain virus diffusion. We finally think that our model can support the healthcare system to react when COVID-19 is increasing.\n\nfection of about 4.3%. Starting from the analysis of number of death with 23 respect to number of identified infected in Italy, we map the percentage in The Coronaviridae family contains many viruses, seven of which are known 27 to be responsible for human diseases (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, MERS-28 CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) [7] . One of the main differences be-29 tween the novel virus and the previous ones is its high spreading rate. Table   30 2 .

We started observing that death percentage has an av-32 erage value with respect to infected cases for all viruses. We report about 33 hypotheses on a death percentage and we extract the number of infections. 34 We compare such a number with respect to officially diffused infected ones. 35 We finally use estimated numbers to evaluate containment measures with 36 respect to infection diffusion. 3 .

Table 1 reports WHO's CFR rate for COVID-19 being equal to 4.3%, 71 which suffers the same problems we have just described. We claim that the 72 total number of detected infections is much lower than the real ones due to 73 the bias described above. We observe that we can derive the real cases of Such information can be useful for governments to plan actions for a 83 better swab testing protocol and for ICU beds and resources strengthening 84 at both a national and regional levels.

Figure 2 : In blue the total infections currently detected in Italy via swab tests. The other bars report three scenarios with different Case Fatality Rates: CFR = 1% with 547, 600 infections (1174.1% more than currently detected), CFR = 2% with 273, 800 infections (587.1% more than currently detected) and CFR = 3% with 182, 533 infections (391.4% more than currently detected).\n\nmeasures need several days for their effect to be seen. The most exposed 98 people are the so-called hubs (or people having many social contacts), which 99 have the highest probability of spreading the infection due to their jobs (e.g. We here report the effects of Italian containment measurements, by con-104 sidering the main three events related to the red zones definitions, as reported 105 in Table 2 . 106 We plot the number of infections considering the first three above reported CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\n\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint .
