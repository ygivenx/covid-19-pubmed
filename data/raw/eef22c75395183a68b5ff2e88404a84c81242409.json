{"title": "National Preparedness Month: opportunities for nurse engagement", "body": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0001-2092(15)00706-1\n\nT hroughout the month of September, multiple federal agencies promote National Preparedness Month through campaigns encouraging the public to actively prepare for unanticipated events ranging from natural disasters to the spread of infectious diseases. This month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is calling on the public to \"Prepare for everywhere,\" by highlighting resources targeted to different realms of preparedness: family, neighborhood, workplace and school, and global. 1 Nurses are respected health professionals in the community, often recognized as an approachable resource for valid health information among friends and family members. Nurses can use this position to provide accurate medical information and advocate best practices. For example, in the case of airborne disease outbreaks, nurses can dispel misinformation presented by the media and encourage simple steps (e.g., hand hygiene, proper cough etiquette) to limit the spread of infectious diseases. Nurses looking to become more actively involved in public health education should seek outreach opportunities in their communities. Special attention should be paid to helping at-risk populations understand the special considerations they should take in emergency situations.\n\nEmergency preparedness in medical facilities relies heavily on the commitment of health care workers to be properly trained and have ready access to the appropriate equipment and medical supplies. Whether preparing for a natural disaster, mass casualty event, or disease outbreak, health care workers should endeavor to keep their emergency response skills up-to-date. Nurses need to be aware of the most recent care recommendations and research to provide evidence-based care to patients in all types of emergency care situations. Participating in drills and simulations can be an important way to identify any part of the emergency response that might be inadequate so that corrective measures can be taken.\n\nNurses can also play a role in emergency preparedness on a global scale through travel and mission work. When health care workers travel abroad for any reason, they must be cognizant of potential pathogens that may return with them, especially as they return to work at domestic health care facilities. The outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in Saudi Arabia demonstrated how easily medical facilities can become the center of a disease outbreak 2 and the spread of the virus to other countries highlighted the role of travel in spreading disease through our interconnected modern world. 3\n\nNurses can play important roles in emergency preparedness in their community, at their facility, and globally. In emergency situations, prepared medical personnel and a well-educated public are important components to limit the extent of human injury or loss or spread of disease. Nurses are a frontline resource for educating the public because they are looked to for reliable information."}
