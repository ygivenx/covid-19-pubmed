{"title": "Asymmetrically interacting spreading dynamics on complex layered networks", "body": "Communication-contact coupled layered networks are one class of multiplex networks41. In such a network, an individual (a node) not only connects with his/her friends on a physical contact layer (subnetwork), but also communicates with them through the (electronic) communication layer. The structures of the two layers can in general be quite different. For example, an indoor-type of individual has few friends in the real world but may have many friends in the cyber space, leading to a much higher degree in the communication layer than in the physical-contact layer. Generally, the degree-to-degree correlation between the two layers cannot be assumed to be strong.\n\nOur correlated network model of communication-contact layers is constructed, as follows. Two subnetworks A and B with the same node set are first generated independently, where A and B denote the communication and contact layers, respectively. Each layer possesses a distinct internal structure, as characterized by measures such as the mean degree and degree distribution. Then each node of layer A is matched one-to-one with that of layer B according to certain rules.\n\nIn an uncorrelated double-layer network, the degree distribution of one layer is completely independent of the distributions of other layer. For example, a hub node with a large number of neighbors in one layer is not necessarily a hub node in the other layer. In contrast, in a correlated double-layer network, the degree distributions of the two layers are strongly dependent upon each other. In a perfectly correlated double-layer network, hub nodes in one layer must simultaneously be hub nodes in the other layer. Quantitatively, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient3942\nms, where ms \u2208 [\u22121, 1] (see definition in Methods), can be used to characterize the degree correlation between the two layers. For ms > 0, the greater the correlation coefficient, the larger degree a pair of counterpart nodes can have. For ms < 0, as |ms| is decreased, a node of larger degree in one layer is matched with a node of smaller degree in the other layer.\n\nThe dynamical processes of disease and information spreading are typically asymmetrically coupled with each other. The dynamics component in our model can be described, as follows. In the communication layer (layer A), the classic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemiological model43 is used to describe the dissemination of information about the disease. In the SIR model, each node can be in one of the three states: (1) susceptible state (S) in which the individual has not received any information about the disease, (2) informed state(I), where the individual is aware of disease and is capable of transmitting the information to other individuals in the same layer, and (3) refractory state (R), in which the individual has received the information but is not willing to pass it on to other nodes. At each time step, the information can propagate from every informed node to all its neighboring nodes. If a neighbor is in the susceptible state, it will be informed with probability \u03b2A. At the same time, each informed node can enter the recovering phase with probability \u00b5A. Once an informed node is recovered, it will remain in this state for all subsequent time. A node in layer A will get the information about the disease once its counterpart node in layer B is infected. As a result, dissemination of the information over layer A is facilitated by disease transmission on layer B.\n\nThe spreading dynamics in layer B can be described by the SIRV model26, in which a fourth sate, the state of vaccination (V), is introduced. Mathematically, the SIR component of the spreading dynamics is identical to the dynamics on layer A except for different infection and recovery rates, denoted by \u03b2B and \u00b5B, respectively. If a node in layer B is in the susceptible state but its counterpart node in layer A is in the infected state, the node in layer B will be vaccinated with probability p. Disease transmission in the contact layer can thus be suppressed by dissemination of information in the communication layer. The two spreading processes and their dynamical interplay are illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. Without loss of generality, we set \u00b5A = \u00b5B = 1.\n\nTwo key quantities in the dynamics of spreading are the outbreak threshold and the fraction of infected nodes in the final steady state. We develop a theory to predict these quantities for both information and epidemic spreading in the double-layer network. In particular, we adopt the heterogeneous mean-field theory44 to uncorrelated double-layer networks.\n\nLet PA(kA) and PB(kB) be the degree distributions of layers A and B, with mean degree \u2329kA\u232a and \u2329kB\u232a, respectively. We assume that the subnetworks associated with both layers are random with no degree correlation. The time evolution of the epidemic spreading is described by the variables , , and , which are the densities of the susceptible, informed, and recovered nodes of degree kA in layer A at time t, respectively. Similarly, , , , and  respectively denote the susceptible, infected, recovered, and vaccinated densities of nodes of degree kB in layer B at time t.\n\nThe mean-field rate equations of the information spreading in layer A are The mean-field rate equations of epidemic spreading in layer B are given by \nwhere \u0398A(t) (\u0398B(t)) is the probability that a neighboring node in layer A (layer B) is in the informed (infected) state (See Methods for details).\n\nFrom Eqs. (1)\u2013(7), the density associated with each distinct state in layer A or B is given by where h \u2208 {A, B}, X \u2208 {S, I, R, V}, and kh,max denotes the largest degree of layer h. The final densities of the whole system can be obtained by taking the limit t \u2192 \u221e.\n\nDue to the complicated interaction between the disease and information spreading processes, it is not feasible to derive the exact threshold values. We resort to a linear approximation method to get the outbreak threshold of information spreading in layer A (see Supporting Information for details) as where denote the outbreak threshold of information spreading in layer A when it is isolated from layer B, and that of epidemic spreading in layer B when the coupling between the two layers is absent, respectively.\n\nEquation (9) has embedded within it two distinct physical mechanisms for information outbreak. The first is the intrinsic information spreading process on the isolated layer A without the impact of the spreading dynamics from layer B. For \u03b2B > \u03b2Bu, the outbreak of epidemic will make a large number of nodes in layer A \u201cinfected\u201d with the information, even if on layer A, the information itself cannot spread through the population efficiently. In this case, the information outbreak has little effect on the epidemic spreading in layer B because very few nodes in this layer are vaccinated. We thus have \u03b2Bc \u2248 \u03b2Bu for \u03b2A \u2264 \u03b2Au.\n\nHowever, for \u03b2A > \u03b2Au, epidemic spreading in layer B is restrained by information spread, as the informed nodes in layer A tend to make their counterpart nodes in layer B vaccinated. Once a node is in the vaccination state, it will no longer be infected. In a general sense, vaccination can be regarded as a type of \u201cdisease,\u201d as every node in layer B can be in one of the two states: infected or vaccinated. Epidemic spreading and vaccination can thus be viewed as a pair of competing \u201cdiseases\u201d spreading in layer B20. As pointed out by Karrer and Newman20, in the limit of large network size N, the two competing diseases can be treated as if they were in fact spreading non-concurrently, one after the other.\n\nInitially, both epidemic and vaccination spreading processes exhibit exponential growth (see Supporting Information). We can thus obtain the ratio of their growth rates as For \u03b8 > 1, the epidemic disease spreads faster than the vaccination. In this case, the vaccination spread is insignificant and can be neglected. For \u03b8 < 1, information spreads much faster than the disease, in accordance with the situation in a modern society. Given that the vaccination and epidemic processes can be treated successively and separately, the epidemic outbreak threshold can be derived by a bond percolation analysis2045 (see details in Supporting Information). We obtain where SA is the density of the informed population, which can be obtained by solving Eqs. (S18) and (S19) in Supporting Information. For \u03b8 < 1, we see from Eq. (11) that the threshold for epidemic outbreak can be enhanced by the following factors: strong heterogeneity in the communication layer, large information-transmission rate, and large vaccination rate.\n\nWe use the standard configuration model to generate networks with power-law degree distributions464748 for the communication subnetwork (layer A). The contact subnetwork in layer B is of the Erd\u0151s and R\u00e9nyi (ER) type49. We use the notation SF-ER to denote the double-layer network. The sizes of both layers are set to be NA = NB = 2 \u00d7 104 and their average degrees are \u2329kA\u232a = \u2329kB\u232a = 8. The degree distribution of the communication layer is  with the coefficient  and the maximum degree . We focus on the case of \u03b3A = 3.0 here in the main text (the results for other values of the exponent, e.g., \u03b3A = 2.7 and 3.5, are similar, which are presented in Supporting Information). The degree distribution of the contact layer is . To initiate an epidemic spreading process, a node in layer B is randomly infected and its counterpart node in layer A is thus in the informed state, too. We implement the updating process with parallel dynamics, which is widely used in statistical physics50 (see Sec. S3A in Supporting Information for more details). The spreading dynamics terminates when all infected nodes in both layers are recovered, and the final densities RA, RB, and VB are then recorded.\n\nFor epidemiological models [e.g., the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and SIR] on networks with a power-law degree distribution, the finite-size scaling method may not be effective to determine the critical point of epidemic dynamics5152, because the outbreak threshold depends on network size and it goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit4353. Therefore, we employ the susceptibility measure52\n\u03c7 to numerically determine the size-dependent outbreak threshold: where N is network size (N = NA = NB), and r denotes the final outbreak ratio such as the final densities RA and RB of the recovered nodes in layers A and B, respectively. We use 2 \u00d7 103 independent dynamic realizations on a fixed double-layer network to calculate the average value of \u03c7 for the communication layer for each value of \u03b2A. As shown in Fig. 2(a), \u03c7 exhibits a maximum value at \u03b2Ac, which is the threshold value of the information spreading process. The simulations are further implemented using 30 different two-layer network realizations to obtain the average value of \u03b2Ac. The identical simulation setting is used for all subsequent numerical results, unless otherwise specified. Figure 2(b) shows the information threshold \u03b2Ac as a function of the disease-transmission rate \u03b2B. Note that the statistical errors are not visible here (same for similar figures in the paper), as they are typically vanishingly small. We see that the behavior of the information threshold can be classified into two classes, as predicted by Eq. (9). In particular, for \u03b2B \u2264 \u03b2Bu = 1/\u2329kB\u232a = 0.125, the disease transmission on layer B has little impact on the information threshold on layer A, as we have . For \u03b2B > \u03b2Bu, the outbreak of epidemic on layer B leads to \u03b2Ac = 0.0. Comparison of the information thresholds for different vaccination rates shows that the value of the vaccination probability p has essentially no effect on \u03b2Ac.\n\nFigure 3 shows the effect of the information-transmission rate \u03b2A and the vaccination rate p on the epidemic threshold \u03b2Bc. From Fig. 3(a), we see that the value of \u03b2Bc is not influenced by \u03b2A for \u03b2A \u2264 \u03b2Au \u2248 0.06, whereas \u03b2Bc increases with \u03b2A. For p = 0.5, the analytical results from Eq. (11) are consistent with the simulated results. However, deviations occur for larger values of p, e.g., p = 0.9, because the effect of information spreading is over-emphasized in cases where the two types of spreading dynamics are treated successively but not simultaneously. The gap between the theoretical and simulated thresholds diminishes as the network size is increased, validating applicability of the analysis method that, strictly speaking, holds only in the thermodynamic limit20 (see details in Supporting Information). Note that a giant residual cluster does not exist in layer B for p = 0.9 and \u03b2A \u2265 0.49, ruling out epidemic outbreak. The phase diagram indicating the possible existence of a giant residual cluster [Eq. (S20) in Supporting Information] is shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a), where in phase II, there is no such cluster. In Fig. 3(b), a large value of p causes \u03b2Bc to increase for \u03b2A > \u03b2Au. We observe that, similar to Fig. 3(a), for relatively large values of p, say p \u2265 0.8, the analytical prediction deviates from the numerical results. The effects of network size N, exponent \u03b3A and SF-SF network structure on the information and epidemic thresholds are discussed in detail in Supporting Information.\n\nThe final dynamical state of the double-layer spreading system is shown in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4(a), we see that the final recovered density RA for information increases with \u03b2A and \u03b2B rapidly for \u03b2A \u2264 \u03b2Au and \u03b2B \u2264 \u03b2Bu. Figure 4(b) reveals that the recovered density RB for disease decreases with \u03b2A. We see that a large value of \u03b2A can prevent the outbreak of epidemic for small values of \u03b2B, as RB \u2192 0 for \u03b2B = 0.2 and \u03b2A \u2265 0.5 (the red solid line). From Fig. 4(c), we see that, with the increase in \u03b2A, more nodes in layer B are vaccinated. It is interesting to note that the vaccinated density VB exhibits a maximum value if \u03b2A is not large. Figure 4 shows that the maximum value of VB is about 0.32, which occurs at \u03b2B \u2248 0.20, for \u03b2A = 0.2. Combining with Fig. 3(a), we find that the corresponding point of the maximum value \u03b2B \u2248 0.20 is close to \u03b2Bc \u2248 0.16 for p = 0.5. This is because the transmission of disease has the opposite effects on the vaccinations. For \u03b2B \u2264 \u03b2Bc, the newly infected nodes in layer B will facilitate information spreading in layer A, resulting in more vaccinated nodes. For \u03b2B > \u03b2Bc, the epidemic spreading will make a large number of nodes infected, reducing the number of nodes that are potentially to be vaccinated. For relatively large values of \u03b2A, information tends to spread much faster than the disease for \u03b2B \u2264 \u03b2Bc, e.g., \u03b8 \u2248 0.21 for \u03b2A = 0.5, p = 0.5, \u03b2Bc \u2248 0.22, and \u03b8 \u2248 0.12 for \u03b2A = 0.9, p = 0.5, and \u03b2Bc \u2248 0.23. In this case, the effect of disease transmission on information spreading is negligible. The densities of the final dynamical states for SF-SF networks are also shown in Supporting Information, and we observe similar behaviors.\n\nIn realistic multiplex networks certain degree of inter-layer correlations is expected to exist35. For example, in social networks, positive inter-layer correlation is more common than negative correlation5455. That is, an \u201cimportant\u201d individual with a large number of links in one network layer (e.g., representing one type of social relations) tends to have many links in other types of network layers that reflect different kinds of social relations. Recent works have shown that inter-layer correlation can have a large impact on the percolation properties of multiplex networks3739. Here, we investigate how the correlation between the communication and contact layers affects the information and disease spreading dynamics. To be concrete, we focus on the effects of positive correlation on the two types of spreading dynamics. It is necessary to construct a two-layer correlated network with adjustable degree of inter-layer correlation. This can be accomplished by first generating a two-layer network with the maximal positive correlation, where each layer has the same structure as uncorrelated networks. Then, Nq pairs of counterpart nodes, in which q is the rematching probability, are rematched randomly, leading to a two-layer network with weaker inter-layer correlation. The inter-layer correlation after rematching is given by (see Methods) which is consistent with the numerical results [e.g., see inset of Fig. 5(a) below]. For SF-ER networks with fixed correlation coefficient, the mean-field rate equations of the double-layer system cannot be written down because the concrete expressions of the conditional probabilities P(kB|kA) and P(kA|kB) are no longer available.\n\nWe investigate how the rematching probability q affects the outbreak thresholds in both the communication and epidemic layers. As shown in Fig. 5, we compare the case of q = 0.8 with that of q = 0.0. From Fig. 5(a), we see that q has little impact on the outbreak threshold \u03b2Ac of the communication layer [with further support in Fig. 6(a), and analytic explanation using ER-ER correlated layered networks in Supporting Information]. We also see that the value of \u03b2Ac for ER-ER layered networks with the same mean degree is greater because of the homogeneity in the degree distribution of layer A. Figures 5(b) and 6(b) show that \u03b2Bc decreases with q or, equivalently, \u03b2Bc increases with ms. This is because stronger inter-layer correlation can increase the probability for nodes with large degrees in layer B to be vaccinated, thus effectively preventing the outbreak of epidemic [see also Eqs. (S38)\u2013(S41) in Supporting Information]. Figure 7 shows the final densities of different populations, providing the consistent result that, with the increase (decrease) of q (ms), the final densities RA and RB increase but the density VB decreases. For SF-SF networks, we obtain similar results (shown in Supporting Information).\n\nTo summarize, we have proposed an asymmetrically interacting, double-layer network model to elucidate the interplay between information diffusion and epidemic spreading, where the former occurs on one layer (the communication layer) and the latter on the counterpart layer. A mean-field based analysis and extensive computations reveal an intricate interdependence of two basic quantities characterizing the spreading dynamics on both layers: the outbreak thresholds and the final fractions of infected nodes. In particular, on the communication layer, the outbreak of the information about the disease can be triggered not only by its own spreading dynamics but also by the the epidemic outbreak on the counter-layer. In addition, high disease and information-transmission rates can enhance markedly the final density of the informed or refractory population. On the layer of physical contact, the epidemic threshold can be increased but only if information itself spreads through the communication layer at a high rate. The information spreading can greatly reduce the final refractory density for the disease through vaccination. While a rapid spread of information will prompt more nodes in the contact layer to consider immunization, the authenticity of the information source must be verified before administrating large-scale vaccination.\n\nWe have also studied the effect of inter-layer correlation on the spreading dynamics, with the finding that stronger correlation has no apparent effect on the information threshold, but it can suppress the epidemic spreading through timely immunization of large-degree nodes56. These results indicate that it is possible to effectively mitigate epidemic spreading through information diffusion, e.g., by informing the high-centrality hubs about the disease.\n\nThe challenges of studying the intricate interplay between social and biological contagions in human populations are generating interesting science57. In this work, we study asymmetrically interacting information-disease dynamics theoretically and computationally, with implications to behavior-disease coupled systems and articulation of potential epidemic-control strategies. Our results would stimulate further works in the more realistic situation of asymmetric interactions.\n\nDuring the final writing of this paper, we noted one preprint posted online studying the dynamical interplay between awareness and epidemic spreading in multiplex networks58. In that work, the two competing infectious strains are described by two SIS processes. The authors find that the epidemic threshold depends on the topological structure of the multiplex network and the interrelation with the awareness process by using a Markov-chain approach. Our work thus provides further understanding and insights into spreading dynamics on multi-layer coupled networks.\n\nTo derive the mean-field rate equations for the density variables, we consider the probabilities that node Ai in layer A and node Bi in layer B become infected during the small time interval [t, t + dt]. On the communication layer, a susceptible node Ai of degree kA can obtain the information in two ways: from its neighbors in the same layer and from its counterpart node in layer B. For the first route, the probability that node Ai receives information from one of its neighbors is kA\u03b2A\u0398A(t)dt, where \u0398A(t) is the probability that a neighboring node is in the informed state59 and is given by where . To model the second scenario, we note that, due to the asymmetric coupling between the two layers, a node in layer A being susceptible requires that its counterpart node in layer B be susceptible, too. A node in the communication layer will get the information about the disease once its counterpart node in layer B is infected, which occurs with the probability , where P(kB|kA) denotes the conditional probability that a node of degree kA in layer A is linked to a node of degree kB in layer B, and kB\u03b2B\u0398B(t)dt is the probability for a counterpart node of degree kB to become infected in the time interval [t, t + dt]. If the subnetworks in both layers are not correlated, we have P(kB|kA) = PB(kB). The mean-field rate equations of the information spreading in layer A are Eqs. (1)\u2013(3).\n\nOn layer B, a susceptible node Bi of degree kB may become infected or vaccinated in the time interval [t, t + dt]. This can occur in two ways. Firstly, it may be infected by a neighboring node in the same layer with the probability kB\u03b2B\u0398B(t)dt, where \u0398B(t) is the probability that a neighbor is in the infected state and is given by where . Secondly, if its counterpart node in layer A has already received the information from one of its neighbors, it will be vaccinated with probability p. The probability for a node in layer B to be vaccinated, taking into account the interaction between the two layers, is , where P(kA|kB) denotes the conditional probability that a node of degree kB in layer B is linked to a node of degree kA in layer A, and  is the informed probability for the counterpart node of degree kA in the susceptible state [P(kA|kB) = PA(kA) for ms = 0]. The mean-field rate equations of epidemic spreading in layer B are Eqs. (4) \u2013 (7). We note that the second term on the right side of Eq. (4) does not contain the variable  because a node in layer B must be in the susceptible state if its counterpart node in layer A is in the susceptible state.\n\nThe correlation between the layers can be quantified by the Spearman rank correlation coefficient3942 defined as where N is network size and \u0394i denotes the difference between node i's degrees in the two layers. When a node in layer A is matched with a random node in layer B, ms is approximately zero in the thermodynamic limit. In this case, the double-layer network is uncorrelated3942. When every node has the same rank of degree in both layers, we have ms \u2248 1. In this case, there is a maximally positive inter-layer correlation where, for example, the hub node with the highest degree in layer A is matched with the largest hub in layer B, and the same holds for the nodes with the smallest degree. In the case of maximally negative correlation, the largest hub in one layer is matched with a node having the minimal degree in the other layer, so we have ms \u2248 \u22121.\n\nIn a double-layer network with the maximally positive correlation, any pair of nodes having the same rank of degree in the respective layers are matched, i.e., \u0394i = 0 for any pair of nodes Ai and Bi. We thus have ms = 1, according to Eq. (16). After random rematching, a pair of nodes have \u0394i = 0 with probability 1 \u2212 q and a random difference  with probability q. Equation (16) can then be rewritten as When all nodes are randomly rematched, the layers in the network are completely uncorrelated, i.e., ms \u2248 0. In this case, we have Submitting Eq. (18) into Eq. (17), the inter-layer correlation after rematching is given by \n\nW.W., M.T. and Y.C.L. devised the research project. W.W. and H.Y. performed numerical simulations.
