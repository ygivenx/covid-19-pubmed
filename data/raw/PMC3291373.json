{"title": "Risk Factors for Human Infection with Avian Influenza A H5N1, Vietnam, 2004", "body": "Persons who met any of the following criteria were considered to be laboratory-confirmed influenza A H5 case-patients: 1) influenza A H5\u2013specific RNA detected in a single specimen by RT-PCR by using 2 different primer pairs; 2) influenza A H5 detected in a single specimen by RT-PCR identification and by sequencing or virus isolation; 3) influenza A H5\u2013specific RNA detected by RT-PCR in 2 different specimen types (e.g., throat swab and tracheal aspirate); and 4) influenza A H5\u2013specific RNA detected by RT-PCR in 2 samples taken on different days. Control-respondents were considered to be true control-respondents if throat swab specimens were negative for influenza A H5\u2013specific RNA by RT-PCR and anti-H5 antibodies could not be detected in serum samples by microneutralization assay (10).\n\nInfluenza A H5 subtype\u2013specific RNA was detected in clinical samples by RT-PCR with primers that targeted regions of the hemagglutinin gene of the influenza H5N1 virus developed by WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Government Virus Unit in Hong Kong. Clinical specimens were injected into Madin-Darby canine kidney cells for virus isolation, and RT-PCR was used to identify influenza A H5. Specimens and cell cultures suspected of containing influenza A H5 were handled according to recognized biosafety standards.\n\nSerum samples were immediately processed, stored at \u201325\u00b0C, and shipped frozen on dry ice to CDC. To measure influenza A H5\u2013specific antibody, microneutralization assay was conducted as previously described (10) by using H5N1 viruses A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/Vietnam/3212/2004. Microneutralization test results were considered to be positive if an anti-H5 titer of >40 was obtained by 2 independent assays.\n\nData entry and analysis of individual explanatory variables was performed by using Epi-Info 6 (CDC, Atlanta, GA, USA). Mantel-Haenszel matched-pair analysis (McNemar test) was used to estimate the strength and statistical significance of associations between exposures and influenza A H5 infection. An association was considered statistically significant if 2-sided tests of significance had a p-value <0.05. To examine independence of effects, multivariate conditional logistic regression was performed by using the conditional logistical regression (CLogit) function in Stata/SE 8.0 for Windows (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX, USA). Any variables with p<0.2 after matched analysis were included in the initial model. A backward stepwise variable- selection strategy was used to construct a final model with a significance level of >0.1 for removal and a significance level of <0.05 for re-entry into the model. Persons missing data for variables under study were excluded from any analysis involving the missing variable. Collinearity was assessed by generating a correlation coefficient matrix for all variables to be considered for inclusion in the regression model. The presence of effect-measure modification by age and sex was assessed for all variables in the final model by entering product terms. A final model was achieved by entering the variables retained in the backward selection model.\n\nThe attributable risk percent (AR%) was estimated as follows: ([odds ratio (OR) \u2013 1]/OR) \u00d7100. The population attributable risk percent (PAR%) was estimated as follows: PAR% = AR% \u00d7 proportion of case-patients exposed.\n\nA total of 28 laboratory-confirmed influenza A H5 cases were detected in 2004 from 15 provinces of Vietnam; 21 (75%) were fatal. All 28 cases were RT-PCR positive for influenza A subtype H5 at either the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Hanoi, or the Pasteur Institute, Ho Chi Minh City; H5N1 virus was isolated in 12. The diagnosis of influenza A H5 infection was independently confirmed for 25: 20 at a WHO reference laboratory and 5 at the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Vietnam.\n\nThe interviews began on February 7, 2004, at which time 20 of the 28 case-patients had already been identified. The interval between onset of illness and interview was a mean of 35.7 days; the maximum interval was 63 days. The mean age of case-patients was 14 years (range 1\u201331 years, median 15 years), and 9 (32%) patients were children <10 years of age. The numbers of male and female case-patients were equal (14 each). Among confirmed case-patients were 2 family clusters (mother and daughter and 2 sisters). A total of 106 control-respondents were enrolled, 4 per case-patient, except for 3 case-patients aged <5 years for whom only 1, 2, and 3 control-respondents could be recruited per case, respectively. All control-respondents were negative for avian influenza A H5\u2013specific RNA by RT-PCR and for anti-H5 antibodies by microneutralization assay. None of the case-patients or control-respondents worked in the commercial (industrial) poultry-raising sector.\n\nThe results of matched-pair analysis are shown in Table 1. Direct handling of sick or dead poultry in the 7 days before onset of illness had the strongest point estimate of effect (matched OR 31) and high statistical significance (p<0.001) despite wide confidence limits (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.4\u20131150). The presence of sick or dying poultry in the household (matched OR 7.4, 95% CI 2.7\u201359) or neighborhood (matched OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.0\u201355.7) was also statistically associated with infection as was the absence of an indoor water source in the household (matched OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.3\u201377.0) and education to high school level or higher (matched OR 16.0, 95% CI 1.2\u2013594.1).\n\nEight variables with p<0.2 were considered for inclusion in the conditional logistic regression model to estimate independence of effects. Although significantly associated with infection in the single-variable analysis, the presence of sick or dead poultry in the neighborhood was excluded from the final regression model because missing data for this variable led to the exclusion of 36 participants (6 case-patients and 30 control-respondents). Educational level was excluded because it was not a relevant variable for the 13 case-patients <15 years of age. Because of the 2 family clusters, each comprising 2 case-patients, the influence of clustering of household-level factors on the regression model was investigated by running the regression model first with all cases and then again including only 1 case from each of these 2 households. All 4 variations of 1 case from each household were run. Because the outcomes of these different approaches did not differ, all cases were included in the final model.\n\nThe final conditional logistic regression model included 3 variables as independent risk factors for H5N1 infection (Table 2). Of the 28 case-patients, 16 (57%) had either sick or dead poultry in their household or had directly prepared sick or dead poultry for consumption; another 6 reported sick or dead poultry in the neighborhood. Of the 28 case-patients, 22 (79%) did not have an indoor water source. No statistically significant effect-measure modification was detected.\n\nAmong persons who prepared sick or dead poultry for consumption, the proportion of H5N1 cases attributable to this practice (AR%) is estimated in this study to be 89% ([(8.99 \u2013 1)/8.99] \u00d7 100). However, because only 32% of all case-patients reported this practice, stopping this practice would prevent only an estimated 28% of H5N1 cases (PAR% = 0.89 \u00d7 0.32).\n\nThis study identified the presence in the household and the handling of dead or sick poultry in an H5N1-affected area as risk factors for human H5N1 infection. Although not surprising, these findings reinforce the hypothesis that close contact with infected domestic poultry is the primary source of transmission of influenza H5N1 to humans. The absence of a statistical association between infection and contact with other animals such as pigs, cats, or dogs is reassuring. Replication and excretion of H5N1 by asymptomatic domestic waterfowl has been demonstrated and is a plausible source of infection for humans (11); however, although a 1997 case-control study found that visiting live poultry markets was a risk factor for human influenza A H5N1 infection (2), our study and the study from Thailand (9) did not identify contact with healthy poultry as a risk factor. However, viral titers in asymptomatic waterfowl may be much lower than in diseased poultry (11) and may therefore pose a low risk to humans, which our study was underpowered to identify.\n\nDespite evidence that limited human-to-human transmission of H5N1 has occurred (3,5,12), we observed no significant differences between case-patients and control-respondents in terms of exposure to persons who might be a source of H5N1 infection, e.g., patients with an acute respiratory infection. This finding is consistent with that of the case-control study in Thailand (9).\n\nA major source of potential bias in this and other studies of risk factors for human H5N1 infection is the use of self-reported prior exposure to sick poultry as a screening tool for identifying potential case-patients. Use of this tool introduces a selection bias that favors finding greater exposure to sick poultry among case-patients than other groups, regardless whether the relationship is causal. In our study, clinicians were not using a systematic screening tool to identify possible H5N1 case-patients, but knowledge of poultry as the source of human H5N1 infection was ubiquitous. Possibly, H5N1 case-patients who did not have exposure to sick poultry may have been less likely to be identified than case-patients who did report this exposure. However, 5 of the 28 case-patients (18%) did not report exposure to sick poultry, indicating that exposure to sick poultry was not a prerequisite for identification as a case-patient. In light of this conflict between clinical necessity and study purity, estimates of the size of the association between exposure to sick poultry and H5N1 infection could be interpreted as maximums that are likely to have been inflated by this selection bias.\n\nThe relatively small number of case-patients means that the study may be underpowered to detect factors posing only a moderate risk for infection and to detect effect modification. A standardized questionnaire and trained interviewing staff were used to try to minimize interviewer bias, but masking the interviewers as to the case or control status of the respondents was not possible. Recall bias was likely to have occurred, especially because the high case-fatality rate meant that a larger proportion of interviews in the case group (26/28) than the control group (35/106) were completed by proxies. The substantial delay between onset of illness and interviews (mean 35.7 days) is also a potential source of recall bias.\n\nThe finding of a significant positive association between level of education and risk for infection was unexpected and is difficult to explain. It may be the consequence of a bias introduced by proxy respondents for deceased case-patients reporting higher levels of education than case-patients had actually achieved.\n\nMisclassification of case-patients and control-respondents was unlikely. All control-respondents were demonstrated to have no detectable antibodies to H5N1, and all case-patients had a clinically compatible illness with laboratory evidence of H5N1 infection, which was independently verified for 25 (89%) of the 28 cases.\n\nPreparing sick or dead poultry for consumption in an H5N1-affected area is a risky practice. Although this study cannot estimate the absolute risk, among those who prepared sick or dead poultry for consumption, a high proportion of infections could be attributed to this practice. However, as the practice was not that widespread in our study participants, stopping it would prevent only an estimated 28% of H5N1 cases. Less risky but more widespread practices probably account for a greater proportion of H5N1 cases; these practices must also be identified and tackled. Regardless whether consumption of infected poultry is itself a risk factor, preparation and consumption of sick or dead poultry in infected areas must stop. That all 106 persons selected as control-respondents from communities with at least 1 confirmed human H5N1 case were negative for H5N1 antibodies adds further evidence to the belief that widespread subclinical H5N1 infection has not yet occurred in Southeast Asia (20).\n\nThe finding of an association between lack of access to an indoor water source and H5N1 infection provides an interesting basis for formulating new hypotheses, but it is not sufficiently strong evidence for concluding that H5N1 transmission is occurring by water or as a result of inadequate hygiene. Despite 2 reports of exposure to potentially contaminated water in Vietnamese H5N1 case-patients ([21]; pers. comm., Ministry of Health, Vietnam), no human cases of H5N1 infection have been directly attributed to exposure to contaminated water. Nevertheless, hygiene practices and access to safe water have collateral benefits regardless of H5N1 and should be encouraged and pursued. Environmental investigations are needed to sample water sources in and around the households of incident H5N1 case-patients and compare the findings to water sources sampled in and around unaffected households.\n\nFamilial clusters of cases have been a significant feature of the epidemiology of H5N1 infection since 2004 in that numerous clusters have occurred in Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Turkey (22,23). Although common exposures and behavior may be one explanation for the marked clustering, most clusters have involved blood relatives such as sibling pairs or parent-child groups rather than unrelated pairs such as husbands and wives. This finding suggests that inherited biologic factors, such as sialic acid receptor phenotype or immune response, may be determinants of infection and disease. Studying intrinsic determinants of susceptibility will require pooling of data and samples from affected families across affected countries. If intrinsic susceptibility were a risk determinant, it might dilute associations between certain behavior and infection unless the analyses were undertaken within subgroups that are homogeneous with respect to their intrinsic susceptibility. In this respect, intrafamilial studies that combine measures of biologic susceptibility with data about behavioral patterns, including food consumption and hygiene practices, may be particularly enlightening."}
