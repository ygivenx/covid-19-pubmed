PRCV, porcine respiratory coronavirus.\n\nSIR -Hochberg and Waage suggested in their News and Views article 1 that some new genetically modified insect viruses will be acceptable as biological control agents because they have \"highly restricted host ranges\". There is widespread agreement that specific biological control agents are much to be preferred, on environmental grounds, over chemical pesticides. But the dangers of nonspecific biocontrols are great, and much damage has resulted from their use 2 .\n\nHow specific are these genetically modified organisms? They are derived from the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV), a baculovirus, which has a wide and sporadic host range in the lepidoptera. There are around 2,500 species of lepidoptera in Britain 3 , and of course many times more elsewhere. The records of host range of this virus4--6, based on a small fraction of the known species, show that, of twe lve superfamilies tested . eight apparently contain 'permissive' species (species killed by fewer virus polyhedra than are produced by one dead caterpi llar). With this and other baculoviruses one species in a genus may be permissive, others resistant and the LD50s vary markedly between different permissive species, without apparent regard for taxonomy.\n\nThe superfamilies known to have permissive species are the Gelichiodea, Pyraloidea, Papilionoidea, Sphingoidea and Noctuoidea: the Bombycoidea, Geometroidea and Yponometroidea may have them , but this needs confirmation by DNA analysis. It seems that 5 -10 per cent of British lepidoptera are permissive for AcNPV, a non-native virus, putting 125-250 species at risk, including some of great conservation value.\n\nThe two new genetically modified organisms 8 \u00b7 9 , like others derived from the same virus 10 , may have host ranges slightly different from that of the wild type. But unless they can be further engineered to be absolutely specific for a known set of (pest) species, it is difficult to see that they could be used safely in an uncontrolled way in the field. Would not the risk assessment required under EC Directive 90/220, for instance, indicate that they are undesirable?\n\nHochberg and Waage 1 also note that \"disabling engineered viruses so that they do not persist has some appeal\". Removing the polyhedrin gene to produce a non-occluded virus 5 \u00b7 10 reduces both persistence and, to a small extent, the host range; neither of the two new genetically modified organisms has apparently been modified in this way.\n\nResearch into the molecular and other bases of host specificity is likely to be a sine qua non for the successful, muchdesired , replacement of chemical control agents for insects by viral ones. phase, positive in a:2 and zero in ~-The net charges calculated by this method should provide reliable trends of ionicity in connected structures when identical basis sets are used.
