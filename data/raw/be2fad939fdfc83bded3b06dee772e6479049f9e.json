{"title": "Additional File 1: GRAPH-DISTANCE DISTRIBUTION OF THE BOLTZMANN ENSEMBLE OF RNA SECONDARY STRUCTURES", "body": "Let G be a structure. For simplicity of notation, we write G = \u2022G if the first position is unpaired, and G = (. . .) j G is the first base is paired to some position j, and G is the substructure of G starting from position j + 1. Alternatively, we may use the notation (i, j) \u2208 G for the case where the position i and j are base paired in G.\n\nThe expected length E[d G (i, j)] can be calculated as: follows:\n\nNow EL sg can be simplified as follows:\n\nwhere P r[G = \u2022G |\u03be[i . . . j]] can be calculated as the probability of the first position to be single-stranded in the sequence \u03be[i . . . j], i.e.,\n\nWe are also able to push the second term since\n\nNow we know that for every G we have that the Boltzmann weighted energy of G is part of the partition function of Q i+1,j . Thus we get\n\nOverall we get\n\nFor the term EL bp(k) , we have a similar reduction:\n\nNow we can again simply extend by Q k+1,j , getting\n\nOverall we get\n\nand thus the second summand. "}
