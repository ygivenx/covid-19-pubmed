{"title": "Novel insights into endogenous RNA viral elements in Ixodes scapularis and other arbovirus vector genomes", "body": "Over 100 million people contract arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) each year (WHO 2014) . Many arboviruses are classified as emerging diseases, meaning their incidence is rapidly increasing; additionally, a large proportion lack preventative measures or treatment (Jones et al. 2008 ; LaBeaud, Bashir, and V C The Author(s) 2019.

Consequently, managing these diseases is essential to limit the morbidity and mortality they cause in human and animal populations.\n\nTwo classes of arthropods transmit arboviruses to mammals: insects and arachnids (Mellor 2000) . All insect vectors are classified into the order Diptera (true flies). Of these, mosquitoes (Culicidae) within the genera Aedes and Culex are the most significant arbovirus vectors, transmitting, e.g. flaviviruses (e.g. Dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and Zika virus (ZIKV)) and togaviruses (e.g. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Ross River virus (RRV)) ( Table 1) . Collectively, these viruses cause over 400 million human infections per year and over 20,000 deaths (LaBeaud, Bashir, and King 2011; Bhatt et al. 2013; WHO 2014) . Sand flies (Psychodidae) and midges (Ceratopogonidae) also transmit pathogenic viruses of humans and livestock, mostly in Southern Europe (Table 1) (Mellor, Boorman, and Baylis 2000; Depaquit et al. 2010) . Of the arachnids, ticks (order Ixodida) are the only group known to transmit arboviruses and are second only to mosquitoes in the diversity of viruses they can transmit (Table 1) (Mansfield et al. 2017 ). Since 2000, several emerging tick-borne viruses have caused human outbreaks in Europe, China, North America, India, and the Middle East (Mansfield et al. 2017) . Compared with mosquitoes, tick-borne viral infections are under-sampled and understudied. In addition, no specific treatments are available, and vaccines exist only for three tick-borne viruses (Louping-ill virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Kyasanur Forest disease virus) but are not widely distributed (Mansfield et al. 2017) .\n\nIn contrast to vertebrates, arthropods tolerate arboviral infections well; they do not usually develop disease once infected and maintain the infection for life. This suggests an innate ability to control viral titre, while still permitting arboviral transmission to the next host (Mellor 2000; Blair 2011 ). However, not all haematophagous arthropods are efficient vectors for the same virus. The ability of a particular virus to replicate within a host is referred to as vector competence (Hardy et al. 1983) . Understanding the factors that influence vector competence is of practical interest, as modifying these can foster the development of targeted arboviral control strategies (Weiss and Aksoy 2011) .\n\nVector competence is driven by the complex interaction between the virus and the host immune system. Arthropods lack an adaptive immune response and rely entirely on innate immunity to control viral infections (Keene et al. 2004; Sanchez-Vargas et al. 2009 ). Small RNA (sRNA) silencing pathways (sRNA SPs), such as RNA interference (RNAi), are a major component of arthropod immunity (Bronkhorst and van Rij 2014) . RNAi is a gene-silencing mechanism modulated by sRNAs, the bestdescribed family of which are small interfering RNAs (siRNAs, 20-25 nt in length). The siRNA pathway is triggered by the accumulation of dsRNA which is cleaved to generate siRNAs. The interaction of siRNAs with proteins of the Argonaute family triggers the silencing of target RNAs (e.g. viral transcripts) mediated by the RNA-induced silencing complex. In mosquitoes, suppression of RNAi enhances the accumulation of viral RNA in Anopheles gambiae (O'nyong nyong virus) and Ae. aegypti (Sindbis virus) and in some cases causes increased mortality (Keene et al. 2004; Campbell et al. 2008; Myles et al. 2008) . In ticks, knockdown of key proteins involved in RNAi results in a significant increase of tick-borne encephalitis virus RNA in Ixodes cells (Weisheit et al. 2015) , suggesting a similar defence mechanism.\n\nPIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) (25-30 nt) were discovered in Drosophila, where they defend against the deleterious effects of transposable elements (TEs) in the germ-line . piRNAs are distinct from other sRNA classes as they interact with a distinct set of proteins (Piwi proteins), and they arise from a ssRNA, not a dsRNA, precursor (Siomi et al. 2011 ). There are two piRNA biogenesis pathways. Primary piRNAs are generated from host transcripts (usually arising from transposon-rich genomic piRNA clusters) that are cleaved to generate 25-30 nt piRNAs. These are amplified via the pingpong cycle, leading to the cleavage of target RNA (e.g. active transposons), producing secondary piRNAs. While piRNA sequences are not conserved between organisms, primary piRNAs unequivocally have a uridine at their 5 0 end (1 U bias), and secondary piRNAs have an adenine bias at the tenth nt from their 5 0 end (10 A bias) (Aravin, Hannon, and Brennecke 2007) . Unlike in Drosophila, mosquitoes can use piRNAs to mount an antiviral defence in cooperation with other sRNA SPs in both somatic and germ cells (Morazzani et al. 2012) . Mosquito piRNAs can be directly produced from exogenous viral RNA, indicating that piRNAs may be derived from both endogenous and exogenous sources, and may play an antiviral role (Vodovar et al. 2012; Miesen, Girardi, and van Rij 2015) . Although recent studies indicate widespread conservation of the piRNA pathway among arthropods (Lewis et al. 2018) , less is known about whether they could play an antiviral role in non-mosquito arthropods.\n\nOne source of endogenous piRNAs is non-retroviral integrated RNA virus sequences (NIRVS) (Vijayendran et al. 2013) . NIRVS arise from the reverse transcription of viral RNA into cDNA and its integration into the genome of a host germ cell, followed by vertical transmission to offspring (Katzourakis and Gifford 2010) . RNA viruses do not integrate into the host genome as part of their lifecycle, so it was initially thought that integration of non-retrotranscribing viruses was serendipitous-especially in vertebrate genomes which contain relatively few insertions (Katzourakis and Gifford 2010 ). Yet recent evidence has highlighted the abundance of NIRVS in some arthropod genomes-e.g., Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus contain >100 NIRVS from over eight RNA virus families encompassing \u00fessRNA, \u00c0ssRNA, and dsRNA viral groups (Palatini et al. 2017; Whitfield et al. 2017) . Additionally, large-scale sequence analysis has shown that many of these NIRVS cluster within piRNA producing genomic regions and produce primary piRNAs (Whitfield et al. 2017; Ter Horst et al. 2018) . This suggests that NIRVS have a functional role, perhaps involving the piRNA pathway.\n\nNIRVS are also a rich source of information about long-term viral evolution, diversity, and host range. In its exogenous state, an RNA virus will typically evolve at 10 \u00c03 substitutions/site/year (Jenkins et al. 2002) , but when integrated into a eukaryotic genome, will evolve several orders of magnitude more slowly (Aiewsakun and Katzourakis 2015) . NIRVS represent near-intact ancient viral sequences, and so can be useful to estimate the timescale of long-term viral evolution, e.g., dating the emergence of modern viral families (Belyi, Levine, and Skalka 2010) . NIRVS are also a useful tool to expand the known host range of viral families, as finding a particular NIRVS family in a genome indicates an ancestral infection event of that host lineage (Aiewsakun and Katzourakis 2015) . The true spectrum of arthropod-infecting RNA viruses is only recently coming to light (Shi et al. 2016 ) and further information on host range and viral diversity can be assisted by the identification and analysis of NIRVS in arthropod genomes.\n\nMost studies thus far have focussed on the abundance and diversity of NIRVS in Aedes genomes, due to the high quality of available genomes and the clinical significance of these vectors CpipJ2/Johannesburg Scaffold (Hammon et al. 1941; Sudia et al. 1967; Monath and Tsai 1987; Turell et al. 2005; Guo et al. 2016) Togaviridae ( Chromosome (Hoskins et al. 2015 ) (Crochu et al. 2004; Roiz et al. 2009; Palatini et al. 2017; Whitfield et al. 2017) . Other studies have also indicated the presence of NIRVS in non-dipteran lineages (Shi et al. 2016; Ter Horst et al. 2018) . As the incidence of disease caused by arboviruses rises it will become important to generate a deeper understanding of NIRVS diversity among non-mosquito vectors. We aimed to examine the spectrum of NIRVS in arbovirus vectors other than Aedes mosquitoes, which represent a threat in the context of emerging viruses. Using the well-studied genomes of Aedes mosquitoes to validate our analysis, we employed a bioinformatic pipeline to characterise NIRVS in seven non-Aedes arbovirus vectors that have representative genomic sequences (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ).\n\nTo identify NIRVS in arthropod genomes, a list of query viral protein sequences was assembled. Type species for each viral family as defined by the International Committee for Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) Master Species List 2017 were used (ICTV 2017). These included all proteins from reference viral genomes of dsRNA viruses, \u00fessRNA viruses and \u00c0ssRNA viruses. Protein sequences from viruses recently identified in arthropods through deep RNA sequencing studies were also included to increase the likelihood of finding sequences from divergent viruses (Cook et al. 2013; Chandler, Liu, and Bennett 2015; Li et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2016 ). This dataset comprised 3,694 protein sequences representing 1,933 distinct viruses (Supplementary Table S1 ).\n\nThe arthropod genomes used for analysis are detailed in Table 1 . The genome of Drosophila melanogaster (Release 6) (Adams et al. 2000; Hoskins et al. 2015) was also searched for NIRVS. This is the best-assembled and annotated arthropod genome and contains no known NIRVS. Therefore, this allowed us to assess whether our pipeline was likely to generate false positives.\n\nIdentification of NIRVS was based on methods outlined previously (Katzourakis and Gifford 2010) which used Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). A tBLASTn search was undertaken separately for each organism in Geneious (v10.2.3) (Kearse et al. 2012) , with all viral protein sequences queried against each arthropod genome. BLAST hits were filtered by Evalue ( 1e \u00c03 ), and duplicate BLAST hits (covering the same region of a host genome) were removed manually. For BLAST hits representing the same NIRVS, the hit containing the maximum genomic coverage was retained. To verify that the BLAST hits were truly viral-derived sequences, a reciprocal search was performed by using translated BLAST hits as query sequences in a tBLASTn search against the NCBI nonredundant (nr) database. Matches to retroviruses, viral cloning vectors, and non-specific matches to host loci or other arthropod loci were discarded. \n\nTo visualise which region of the viral genome NIRVS were derived from, NIRVS were aligned individually to the genome of a closely related extant virus using ClustalW (v2.0), which does not penalise end-gaps in the nucleotide alignment (Larkin et al. 2007 ). Alignments were concatenated, and duplicates of the reference sequence were removed. Alignments were visualised in GraphPad Prism (v7.0) based on the numerical mapping position of the NIRVS to the reference sequence. For alignments and trees containing mononegaviruses and mononega-like viruses, the Chuviridae was included. The Chuviridae is not technically part of this order but shares a close phylogenetic relationship with mononegaviruses (Li et al. 2015) .\n\nTo calculate which proportion of NIRVS had significant identity to other NIRVS within the same genome, indicating that they were probably duplicated sequences, a ClustalW (v2.0) alignment of all NIRVS within each genome was performed in Geneious (v10.2.3). The distance matrix from this alignment was used to identify NIRVS with >98 per cent nt identity to any other NIRVS.\n\nTo create phylogenetic trees broadly representing each group of NIRVS in this study, a collection of representative nucleotide sequences corresponding to the respective RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region of each group was downloaded from NCBI (Supplementary Table S3 ). Translated nt sequences, which were of similar sequence lengths, were aligned using MAFFT (v7.017) (Katoh et al. 2002) and trimmed using trimAl (v1.4.1) (Capella-Gutierrez, Silla-Martinez, and Gabaldon 2009). Maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were created in RAxML (v8.2.8) (Stamatakis 2014) .\n\nTo perform phylogenetic analysis of specific NIRVS from I. scapularis, twenty-five closely related viral sequences were identified by a tBLASTn search against the nr database. Nt sequences of the same gene from which the NIRVS was derived (e.g. replicase) were downloaded for these viruses, as well as a more distantly-related outgroup sequence. Sequences were aligned and trimmed as above. ML phylogenetic trees were created in RAxML (v8.2.8) (Stamatakis 2014) , with an automated aa substitution model and rapid bootstrapping with 500 nonparametric replicates. Eukaryotic hosts of each viral species included in the phylogenetic analyses were deduced from study metadata and manually indicated on the tree.\n\n2.6 piRNA cluster prediction in the I. scapularis genome Analysis of a publicly available sRNA dataset from I. scapularis was performed on The University of Queensland Galaxy server (https://usegalaxy.org.au) (Afgan et al. 2018) . Raw sequencing reads were downloaded from NCBI [BioProject Accession PRJNA315659], read quality was assessed with FastQC (Andrews 2010) , and Illumina sRNA adapters were trimmed with Trim Galore! (Galaxy v0.4.3.1). This dataset, along with the I. scapularis IscaW1 genome assembly (Gulia-Nuss et al. 2016) , was used to predict piRNA-producing loci with proTRAC (v2.4.2) (Rosenkranz and Zischler 2012) applying custom parameters as previously defined (Ter Horst et al. 2018) . NIRVS residing completely within predicted piRNA clusters were identified using a Megablast search implemented in Geneious (v10.2.3), with BLAST matches exhibiting both 100 per cent nt identity and query cover considered to reside within the cluster. The probability of integration into a piRNA cluster was defined as the percentage of the genome occupied by piRNA clusters. A cumulative binomial distribution was used to estimate whether NIRVS had preferentially integrated into piRNA clusters, as opposed to randomly within the genome.\n\nTo judge TE enrichment in regions around NIRVS, genomic sequence lying 5 kb either side of each NIRVS was extracted. For NIRVS that did not contain more than 5 kb flanking sequence due to the size of the scaffold, the sequence up until the end of the genomic scaffold was retained. RepeatMasker (v4.0.7) (Smit, Hubley, and Green 2018) was used to estimate the TE composition of these regions, with a list of predicted TEs identified in the IscaW1 genome assembly as a reference. These proportions were then compared with the genome-wide TE composition (Gulia-Nuss et al. 2016) . Where two annotations encompassed more than 100 nt of overlapping genomic region, the annotation with the highest Smith-Waterman score was retained. We also analysed an NIRVS 'hotspot', where multiple NIRVS from different families were present in nearby loci. This was scaffold DS826508, nt position 110,866-186,277, which contained NIRVS from the Orthomyxoviridae (n = 2), Mononegavirales (n = 2), and Bunyavirales (n = 1) in close proximity (Supplementary Table S2 ).\n\nThe above sRNA dataset [PRJNA315659] was used to further characterise NIRVS-derived sRNAs. For evaluation of the NIRVS sequence content of total sRNA, the forward reads from all four sequencing runs were merged and HISAT2 (Galaxy v2.1.0) (Kim, Langmead, and Salzberg 2015) was used to align the reads to a reference FASTA file containing all I. scapularis NIRVS. Aligned reads were extracted and quantified with Salmon (v0.8.2) with custom parameters: (-kmerLen 19; -unmatedReads; incompatPrior 0.0) (Patro et al. 2017) . Read counts were then grouped by the NIRVS' viral family of origin, and the proportion of total reads corresponding to each family was calculated.\n\nTo assess NIRVS-derived sRNA abundance by sequence length, the aligned reads (forward and reverse strand) for each k-mer (18-30 nt) were quantified with Salmon (v0.8.2) and then divided by the total number of sequences comprising that dataset to calculate the relative number of NIRVS-derived sRNAs for each k-mer. To assess nt bias at each position of the sRNA sequences, mapped sRNA reads (18-30 nt) were trimmed to 10 nt from the 3 0 end and used as input in WebLogo (v3.0) (Crooks et al. 2004) .\n\nThe sRNA dataset used contained two replicates each of mock infection, and two of infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the causative agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Although this was not a viral infection, we examined whether NIRVS transcription was upregulated upon general immune responses to bacterial infection. Forward reads from the two infection datasets (SRA ID SRR3236780-SRR3236781) were mapped to all NIRVS and quantified with Salmon (v0.8.2). This was repeated for the mock datasets (SRA ID SRR3236782-SRR3236783). Differential expression counts of the sRNAs were calculated with DESeq2 (Galaxy v2.11.39) (Love, Huber, and Anders 2014).\n\nRecent literature has described a large number of Aedes NIRVS, so we initially analysed the genomes of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus to confirm the robustness of our pipeline. Both species had a similar abundance of NIRVS (Ae. aegypti, n = 276, Ae. albopictus, n = 276). We then detected NIRVS in a further six arthropods that are known to transmit pathogenic vertebrate viruses. The I. scapularis genome harboured the next largest number of NIRVS (n = 143), followed by Cx. quinquefasciatus (n = 28), An. gambiae (n = 24), C. sonorensis (n = 4), P. papatasi (n = 2), and R. microplus (n = 1) (Supplementary Table S2 ). Integrations from negative-sense viruses dominated in most organisms: Ae. aegypti, n = 243 (88%), Ae. albopictus, n = 233 (84%), I. scapularis n = 142 (99%), Cx. quinquefasciatus n = 28 (100%), An. gambiae n = 24 (100%), and C. sonorensis n = 4 (100%) ( Fig. 2A ). In P. papatasi and R. microplus there was one \u00c0ssRNA derived NIRVS ( Fig. 2A ; Supplementary Table S2 ). All other NIRVS were related to either \u00fessRNA or dsRNA viral sequences (Figs 3 and 4). No NIRVS were identified in the negative control genome of D. melanogaster.\n\nMany arthropods contain a high proportion of TEs in their genomes; Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti contain about 68 and 47 per cent TEs, respectively (Nene et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2015) . Due to the important role of repeat sequences in arthropod evolution (Peccoud et al. 2017 ), we suspected that many of the NIRVS identified were generated due to post-insertion duplication and not by distinct integration events. Using a ClustalW alignment and distance matrix, we calculated whether NIRVS shared high sequence identity with other NIRVS within the genome. Of 276 NIRVS in Ae. aegypti, 126 (46%) shared at least 98 per cent nt identity with at least one other NIRVS. In Ae. albopictus, this number was 196 (71%), in I. scapularis it was 26 (18%); 20 in Cx. quinquefasciatus (71%), and 11 in An. gambiae (44%) (Supplementary Table S4 ). There was no evidence of duplicated NIRVS in other organisms with multiple NIRVS (C. sonorensis and P. papatasi) (Supplementary Table S4 ). In Ae. aegypti and I. scapularis, we visually represented duplicated NIRVS within the groups Mononegavirales, Bunyavirales, and Orthomyxoviridae (Fig. 5 ). A similar pattern was observed in I. scapularis where most \u00c0ssRNA NIRVS were classified in the Mononegavirales in either the Rhabdoviridae (n = 44 [31% of \u00c0ssRNA NIRVS]) or among unclassified mononegaviruses (n = 48, 34%) (Fig. 2) . NIRVS related to bunyaviruses (n = 29, 20%) were notably more abundant than in dipterans, and evenly distributed among the Phenuiviridae (n = 11, 8%) and Nairoviridae (n = 18, 13%) (Fig. 2) . Orthomyxo-like NIRVS (n = 19, 13%) were the next most prevalent, followed by the Chuviridae (n = 2, 1%) (Fig. 2) . In Cx. quinquefasciatus and An. gambiae, the \u00c0ssRNA NIRVS were related to unclassified mononegaviruses (n = 18 and n = 13 [64 and 54% \u00c0ssRNA NIRVS, respectively]), chuviruses (both n = 9 [32 and 38%, respectively]), or rhabdoviruses (Cx. quinquefasciatus n = 1, 4%) (Fig. 2 ). An. gambiae also contained both one phasma-and one phenui-like insertion (Supplementary Table S2 Table S2 ). This pattern was consistent for Cx. quinquefasciatus (n = 28/28, 100%) and An. gambiae (n = 22/22, 100%) ( Fig. 2A) . Notably, I. scapularis possessed more nonstructural [L] region integrations from mononega-like viruses (n = 76/94, 81%), with the remainder from structural regions (n = 18/94, 19%) ( Fig. 2A) . To visually demonstrate this difference, a comparative alignment between negative-sense NIRVS in Ae. aegypti and I. scapularis was created, demonstrating the skew towards either structural or non-structural integration in each organism (Fig. 5A) .\n\nIn terms of specific structural integrations from mononegalike viruses, GP-derived NIRVS were overrepresented in Ae. albopictus (n = 158/221 mononega-like insertions, 76%), Cx. quinquefasciatus (n = 26/28, 93%), and An. gambiae (n = 22/22, 100%), with either fewer or no NP-derived NIRVS in these organisms (n = 48/ 209 [23%], n = 2/28 [7%], and n = 0/24 [0%], respectively). Alternatively, NP-derived NIRVS were more abundant in Ae. aegypti (n = 122/236, 52%) with fewer GP-derived integrations (n = 90/236, 38%), and a single integration was derived from the M gene (Fig. 5A ) and another from a protein of unknown function (Supplementary Table S2 ). Similarly, structural proteinderived mononega-like NIRVS in I. scapularis were mostly derived from NP sequences (n = 40/42, 95%), with only two GPrelated NIRVS (5%) (Fig. 5A ).\n\nThe Hepe-Virga clade and the Flaviviridae were the two major lineages comprising NIRVS from \u00fessRNA viruses ( Fig. 3 ; Supplementary Fig. S2 ). \u00fessRNA NIRVS related to the Flaviviridae were the most abundant, but were only observed in Aedes mosquitoes (Ae. aegypti, n = 21 [75% \u00fessRNA NIRVS], Ae. albopictus, n = 29, 81%) (Fig. 3) . This was also the case for Negelike viruses (Ae. aegypti, n = 4 [14%], Ae. albopictus, n = 5 [14%]), and Hepe-Virga-like viruses (Ae. aegypti, n = 3 [11%], Ae. albopictus, n = 2 [6%]) ( Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. S2 ). No \u00fessRNA virusderived NIRVS were detected in P. papatasi, R. microplus, or D. melanogaster. Putative Nido-like NIRVS were initially detected in Ae. albopictus (n = 2), and once each in Ae. aegypti, Cx. quinquefasciatus, An. gambiae, C. sonorensis, and D. melanogaster; however, the identity of this as a true NIRVS was disputed (see further discussion below, section 3.5).\n\n3.4.2 dsRNA virus derived NIRVS dsRNA virus-derived NIRVS were the least abundant across all organisms (n = 14 total; Supplementary Fig. S3 ). dsRNA NIRVS could be classified as either Partiti-like or Toti-like, i.e. relatives of the fungal and protozoan-infecting families Partitiviridae and Totiviridae, respectively (Fig. 4) . In Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, all dsRNA-like NIRVS (n = 5 and n = 7, respectively) were Toti-like (Fig. 4) \n\nWhen searching for NIRVS, false positive hits can arise from viral query proteins that have chance homology to eukaryotic proteins (e.g. heat shock proteins). These can usually be eliminated with a reverse tBLASTn search against the nr database, where no viral hits are produced, as hits to eukaryotes are much stronger. We observed an unusual BLAST hit in Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, An. gambiae, Cx. quinquefasciatus, C. sonorensis, and D. melanogaster with homology to the ORF1a (replicase) protein of mosquito-specific viruses in the Mesoniviridae (order Nidovirales) ( RdRp sequences, as listed in Supplementary Table S3 ). Shapes correspond to the abundance of NIRVS from that group as shown in the legend, and colour represents the organism analysed (right-hand panels). Viral orders are encircled with dotted lines, and families are shaded grey. The scale bar represents aa substitutions per site.\n\ndatabase generated a list of close matches to hypothetical proteins from related insect species, in addition to more distantly related viral hits, so we did not fully eliminate this as a false positive hit.\n\nWe next analysed the flanking regions of this putative NIRVS, to see whether it was part of a functional protein coding sequence. The putative NIRVS was part of an open reading frame (ORF) spanning approximately 1,100 nt in all surveyed organisms, which encoded an annotated hypothetical protein in Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, An. gambiae, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and D. melanogaster (Table 2) . Therefore, it seemed that this hit represented a conserved protein containing a 'nido-like' domain ($600 nt identity, ranging from 26.1 to 45.3%) (Supplementary Table S2 ). We performed a BLASTp search of this conserved protein to find potential homologues but generated a list of results similar to the initial tBLASTn search (Supplementary Table S5 ).\n\nOwing to the emerging threat of tick-borne viruses, it is crucial to sample viral diversity in ticks. NIRVS can represent novel phylogenetic lineages which have not been sampled in the exogenous form. Therefore, we performed phylogenetic analysis on six I. scapularis NIRVS from different taxonomic groups.\n\nThis encompassed a wide range of genetic diversity, while using the longest sequence from each group ensured high phylogenetic resolution (Table 3 and Fig. 6 ).\n\nThe single partiti-like NIRVS (218 nt) was derived from the conserved RdRp region, and clusters monophyletically with Norway partiti-like virus 1 [MF141076] that was isolated from I. ricinus (Fig. 6A) ). Overall, these arthropod-specific partiti-like viruses form a clade related to, but distinct from, the Partitiviridae family (Fig. 6A ). However, due to the short sequence length there is low bootstrap support (<50%) for most tree nodes (Fig. 6A) .\n\nThe longest chuvirus-like NIRVS (509 nt, genomic scaffold DS620777) was related to the chuviral glycoprotein (M) gene. It sits basally to a larger cluster of arthropod-specific chuviruses; which includes a tick-specific cluster ( (Fig. 6B) . Orthomyxo-like NIRVS in I. scapularis were more abundant than in any dipteran, and the longest (1079 nt, derived from the PB1 protein coding region), clustered in a group of 0.3 . This cluster is distinct from sandfly borne human pathogens (e.g. Rift Valley Fever phlebovirus), and from the well-described tick-specific Uukuniemi virus clade (Fig. 6D) . The NP-derived nairo-like NIRVS falls into an Ixodes-specific cluster within the Nairoviridae, distinct from several clusters infecting either hard ticks (Ixodidae) or soft ticks (Argasidae) (Fig. 6E) . Lastly, the rhabdolike NIRVS which was particularly long (3,950 nt) can be classified into a tick-specific rhabdo-like cluster, where its closest relative is Norway mononegavirus 1 (Fig. 6F ). This classification notably did not align with its closest BLAST result which was the equine-infecting vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (Table 3) .\n\nUsing proTRAC (v2.4.2), 1,774 piRNA clusters were predicted in I. scapularis which comprised a total of 8,129,613 bp (0.46% of the genome). Thirty-two NIRVS (22%) resided totally within these clusters, with the remaining 111 either partially present or absent from the clusters. The cumulative binomial probability that at least 32 NIRVS integrated into piRNA clusters was P < 0.000001, indicating a strong preference for integration into these sites.\n\nIn Ae. aegypti, LTR retrotransposons (Pao_Bel/Ty3_gypsy) are associated with NIRVS integration (Palatini et al. 2017 ). In I. scapularis, genomic regions flanking NIRVS were associated with a two-fold enrichment of fragments of non-long-terminal repeat (non-LTR) class I retrotransposons (6.70% in the whole genome vs. 11.55% in NIRVS flanking sites), but not of LTR retrotransposons (0.64 vs. 0.87%) or DNA transposons (3.06 vs. 3.70%) ( Table 4 ). Among the non-LTR retrotransposon fragments, the most relatively enriched were R1 elements (0.00 vs. 0.78%), I elements (0.53 vs. 4.71%), and L1 elements (2.09 vs. 4.30%) ( Table 4 ). The NIRVS 'hotspot' on scaffold DS826508 also contained a high proportion of non-LTR retrotransposons (9.02%), but not as many I elements (0.88%) or R1 elements (0.00%) ( Table 4) . \n\nIt has been shown that piRNAs are produced by NIRVS in a variety of arthropods (Palatini et al. 2017; Ter Horst et al. 2018) . To determine whether this was the case in our own dataset, we analysed a publicly available I. scapularis sRNA dataset for the presence of piRNAs derived from NIRVS loci (BioProject accession PRJNA315659). Out of 132,048,347 sRNA reads originating from four independent sequencing runs, 68,823 (0.05%) mapped exactly to at least one NIRVS. These originated primarily from NIRVS related to rhabdoviruses (35.6%), unassigned mononegaviruses (24.2%), orthomyxoviruses (18.5%), phenuiviruses (16.2%), nairoviruses (3.6%), and chuviruses (1.9%); these proportions are very similar to the abundance of each NIRVS family within the genome (Fig. 7A) . The most abundant NIRVS-derived sRNAs were 28 nt in length (0.046% total 28-mers), followed by 29 nt (0.045%), 27 nt (0.039%), 26 nt (0.035%), 30 nt (0.034%), 25 nt (0.028%), 24 nt (0.017%), 23 nt (0.012%), 20 nt (0.008%), 21 nt (0.007%), 22 nt (0.004%), and 19 nt (0.003%) (Fig. 7B) . Additionally, NIRVSderived sRNAs were predominantly antisense (20,538 reads, 90.9%) as opposed to sense (2,067 reads, 9.1%) (Fig. 7B) . The length of the NIRVS-derived sRNAs (primarily 25-30 nt sRNAs) their predominantly antisense nature, and the strong bias for a uridine at their 5 0 position make them strongly reminiscent of primary piRNAs (Fig. 7B and C) .\n\nIn the range of 18-30 nt, the most abundantly expressed NIRVS were DS841316 (Rhabdo-like, L protein, 2,349 reads), DS884533_1 (Rhabdo-like, L protein, 1,511 total reads), DS731648_2 (Phenui-like, L protein, 1,908 reads), DS810239_2 (Nairo-like, N protein, 1,572 reads), and DS826508_3 N protein, 1, 192 reads) (Supplementary Table  S6 ). No sRNAs were significantly up-or down-regulated (adjusted P-value <0.05) upon infection with A. phagocytophilum.\n\nArthropods that transmit viruses to vertebrate hosts maintain a fine balance between carrying a viral infection for an extended Figure 6 . ML phylogenetic trees of six NIRVS from the blacklegged tick I. scapularis. Following identification of 143 NIRVS within the I. scapularis genome, the longest from each family of negative-sense viruses was selected for phylogenetic analysis (n \u00bc 5). A dsRNA NIRVS was also selected as it was the unique NIRVS of this type identified (A). First, a tBLASTn search was performed using the NIRVS against the NCBI nr database to generate a list of close matches. The top 25 most closely related sequences were chosen, as well a more distantly related outgroup sequence. Sequences were aligned with MAFFT (v7.017) and trimmed with trimAl (v1.4.1). A RAxML period and avoiding the deleterious effects of viral infection. NIRVS are proposed to be a heritable antiviral defence mechanism, interacting with sRNA SPs to attenuate transcripts of an infecting virus (Palatini et al. 2017) . It is now well-established that NIRVS accumulation is a feature of multiple arthropod classes (Ter Horst et al. 2018 ). Yet besides Aedes spp., an in-depth analysis of NIRVS in emerging arbovirus vectors is lacking. To address this gap, we selected six non-Aedes arbovirus vectors for NIRVS analysis. We uncovered more NIRVS in the mosquitoes Cx. quinquefasciatus and An. gambiae than reported previously, and we characterised novel NIRVS in the non-mosquito dipterans C. sonorensis and P. papatasi, and in the Asian blue tick R. microplus. The focus of our study, however, became the preponderance of NIRVS in the deer tick I. scapularis, which exhibit unusual characteristics and are likely to be associated with the piRNA pathway.\n\nAe. aegypti and Ae. albopictus are the best-studied arthropods in the context of NIRVS and were therefore used as validation organisms for our NIRVS identification pipeline. Our count in Ae. aegypti (n = 276) (Figs 2-4) was considerably more than Palatini et al. (2017) (n = 122) who used a similar BLAST-based approach, and a recent version of the same genome (AaegL3.0) (Palatini et al. 2017 ). Our results may reflect a more extensive range of query viruses (n = 1,933 vs. n = 425). Alternatively, Whitfield et al. (2017) reported 472 NIRVS in Ae. aegypti, but used a long-read based genome assembly for NIRVS identification. Since the current AaegL5.0 assembly is based on short-read technology, highly repetitive NIRVS-rich regions may be masked (Dudchenko et al. 2017; Whitfield et al. 2017) . These variable figures suggest that the number of NIRVS reported is not definitive but is contingent on filtering parameters and the quality of host genome assembly.\n\nIn Ae. albopictus, we reported 276 NIRVS (Figs 2-4) , also higher than Palatini et al. (n = 72) , yet they used a genome from a different source (Foshan strain as opposed to C6/36 cell line used in our study). However, the true number of NIRVS in Ae. albopictus is probably as high as or higher than Ae. aegypti, as it contains an even higher proportion of TEs (Chen et al. 2015) , including LTR retrotransposons which may be responsible for NIRVS formation. Despite the discrepancies, both studies report similar NIRVS characteristics. These NIRVS were dominated by insertions from the structural gene-coding regions (N and G) of negative-sense viruses (predominantly mononegaviruses), with fewer insertions from \u00fessRNA and dsRNA viruses. This indicates that the methodology of the current study, which identified NIRVS without generating excessive false positive hits, is robust.\n\nWe observed that Cx. quinquefasciatus and An. gambiae harboured approximately twenty NIRVS each (Figs 2-4; Supplementary Table S2) , which is inconsistent with Palatini et al. (2017) who identified no NIRVS in An. gambiae, and only one NIRVS in Cx. quinquefasciatus. These mosquitoes therefore possess more NIRVS than previously thought, with similar characteristics to Aedes NIRVS, i.e. dominated by integrations from structural regions of negative-sense viruses ( Fig. 2A ; Supplementary Table S2) .\n\nIn this study, we included two non-mosquito dipterans which transmit emerging mammalian viruses (Table 1) . Analysis revealed NIRVS in P. papatasi (n = 2) (bunya-and partiti-like) and C. sonorensis (n = 4) (chu-and bunya-like) (Figs 2   Table 4 . Transposable element (TE) occupancy in the entire I. scapularis genome, in regions with NIRVS, and in a region containing multiple NIRVS from three different viral groups (located on scaffold DS826508).\n\nIscaW1 genome assembly (1, 765, 382, 190 Table S2 ), demonstrating that these NIRVS probably originated from highly divergent viruses. The virome of these organisms has not been extensively sampled, yet our results imply the presence of circulating, divergent, and arthropod-specific viruses in these species, which may be important for future studies. Overall, our results suggest that NIRVS accumulation is primarily a feature of mosquitoes, and not other dipterans.\n\nNIRVS are not usually present as protein coding regions, but as fragmented sequences containing stop codons. However, viral proteins can be repurposed by their hosts (exapted) in remarkable instances of horizontal evolution (Koonin and Krupovic 2018) . A BLAST hit in six dipteran genomes revealed the presence of a hypothetical protein containing a nido-like domain ( Table S5 ). Although hits to nidoviruses still arose, homology to these was generally weaker than to other insect proteins (e.g. in Ae. aegypti), the hypothetical protein LOC5579059 exhibited 52 matches to uncharacterised proteins from other insects (E-values ranging from 0 to 2.07E \u00c019 ) before a viral hit occured (E-value 2.43E \u00c019 ) (Supplementary Table S5 ). The pp1a nidovirus protein, to which BLAST matches were generated, is a multifunctional replicase enzyme (Ziebuhr 2006) . We speculated that this region of similarity could signify a conserved enzymatic function between virus and eukaryote, e.g. helicase; however, no functional protein motifs were observed in this viral region. Due to the nature of the putative NIRVS it could represent an exapted viral protein which integrated prior to the divergence of the hosts, now serving a novel function in present-day lineages. This possibility is especially interesting as arthropods are predicted to be the origin of some present-day viral groups (Marklewitz et al. 2015) . Alternatively, it could represent a case of host-to-virus exaptation, or protein mimicry by the virus (Alcami 2003) , although these possibilities are unlikely in the case of an RNA virus. Further analysis of these NIRVS are beyond the scope of this manuscript, but these possibilities present an intriguing opportunity for future analysis.\n\nWe revealed an abundance of NIRVS in I. scapularis (n = 143), which is broadly consistent with other studies of Ixodes spp. who report >100 NIRVS (Ter Horst et al. 2018) . The majority of our NIRVS generated a BLAST match to viruses isolated from hard ticks (Supplementary Table S2) , and phylogenetic analysis of six NIRVS supported their classification into tick-specific viral clades (Fig. 6) . originating from both the sense (green) and antisense (purple) genomic strand. (C) Sequence logo depicting ribonucleotide preference (probability) among the first ten nucleotides of NIRVS-derived sRNAs, from both the sense and antisense genomic strands.\n\nWe found both similarities and differences between NIRVS in I. scapularis and dipterans. Like the dipterans, I. scapularis NIRVS were dominated by negative-sense viruses (n = 142, 99%) which consisted primarily of insertions from non-segmented negative-sense (NNS) viruses (i.e. mononegaviruses) (n = 92, 64%) (Figs 2 and 5; Supplementary Table S2 ). Yet among the NNS viral insertions, we observed a bias towards non-structural region integration (L protein) as opposed to structural regions (G and N), which are conversely more abundant in mosquitoes (Fig. 5A ). This bias towards NIRVS from the structural region of negative-sense viruses is thought to reflect relative mRNA abundance during infection, where the NP is the most abundant and L the least (Holmes 2011) . Here, the unexpected abundance of L integrations could reflect an unusual template preference for the endogenous reverse transcriptases (RTs) and integrases in I. scapularis which catalyse NIRVS formation.\n\nAnother unusual aspect of NIRVS in I. scapularis was the overrepresentation of integrations from segmented negativesense (SNS) RNA viruses (orthomyxo-like and bunya-like) (n = 51, 36%) (Figs 2 and 5). In contrast, all other surveyed organisms contained few SNS virus-like NIRVS (Ae. aegypti n = 6, Ae. albopictus n = 13, An. gambiae n = 2, C. sonorensis n = 3, R. microplus n = 1) ( Fig. 2 ; Supplementary Table S2 ). Specifically, the orthomyxo-like NIRVS in I. scapularis were exclusively related to tick-borne viruses in the genus Quaranjavirus (Presti et al. 2009 ). Orthomyxoviruses replicate in the nucleus (Ruigrok et al. 2010) , where proximity to the host genome may predispose them to NIRVS formation. However, studies on orthomyxovirus replication are heavily biased towards influenza viruses, and mechanisms of quaranjavirus replication are little explored. Similar observations were made for the bunya-like insertions, again abundant in I. scapularis (n = 30) despite being infrequent in other surveyed organisms. These could be classified as phenuilike or nairo-like (related to the Phenuiviridae or Nairoviridae). In contrast, phasma-like (Phasmaviridae-related) insertions were confined to Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, P. papatasi, and An. gambiae (Supplementary Table S2 ). This mirrors the known host range of these families, whereby the Nairoviridae is tick-borne, the Phenuiviridae infects insects and arachnids, and the Phasmaviridae is insect-borne (Lasecka and Baron 2014) . Overall, the detection of multiple SNS viral insertions here suggests that ticks are the dominant hosts of these viral groups.\n\nCuriously, I. scapularis lacked NIRVS from positive-sense RNA viruses, which comprise about one tenth of NIRVS in Aedes mosquitoes ( Fig. 3; Supplementary Table S2 ). In particular, flavivirus-derived NIRVS are the most abundant positive-sense group in mosquitoes, yet despite the existence of a tick-borne Flavivirus clade, we did not observe any flavi-like NIRVS in I. scapularis. This is surprising, as tick-borne flaviviruses are vertically transmitted in nature (Brackney and Armstrong 2016) . Their absence could reflect that positive-sense viral genomes are unfavourable templates for ixodid NIRVS formation. Alternatively, since most tick-borne arboviruses are confined to certain groups (Bunyavirales, Orthomyxoviridae, Flaviviridae), tick viruses outside these groups are significantly under-sampled (Junglen 2016) . Accordingly, identification of tick-specific viruses in other groups may reveal positive-sense NIRVS which are too divergent to be detected here.\n\nAnalysis of the R. microplus genome revealed only one NIRVS, a much lower figure than I. scapularis (n = 143) ( Fig. 2;  Supplementary Table S2 ). This is an interesting disparity, both ticks contain a high proportion of repetitive elements ($70%) (Barrero et al. 2017) . Our data suggest that NIRVS accumulation is perhaps confined to Ixodes ticks, an observation validated by another study which also identified numerous NIRVS in I. ricinus (Ter Horst et al. 2018) . This difference could reflect factors such as inefficient vertical viral transmission among Rhipicephalus spp., or an alternative TE landscape which does not favour NIRVS formation. Importantly, genome sequencing of more hard and soft ticks will help to further characterise tick NIRVS.\n\nA requirement for the formation of an NIRVS is infection of a germ cell, permitting transmission of the integrated viral sequence to offspring (Aiewsakun and Katzourakis 2015) . Each NIRVS is the footprint of a germline viral infection, suggesting vertical transmission of all the viral NIRVS groups identified here. Although vertical transmission of tick viruses is proposed to occur in nature (Labuda and Nuttall 2004) , information is limited. Our data suggest that in I. scapularis, vertical transmission of mononegaviruses, bunyaviruses, and orthomyxoviruses may occur regularly, giving them ample opportunity to integrate.\n\nMost of the NIRVS here appeared to originate from tickspecific viral groups (Fig. 6 ). An exception was NIRVS from the genus Quaranjavirus (Orthomyxoviridae) (Fig. 6C) . Quaranjaviruses appear to have a dual vertebrate-arthropod host range; e.g., Wellfleet Bay virus can cause mass mortality in wild bird populations (Allison et al. 2015) . The presence of NIRVS derived from this group therefore implies the potential for vertical transmission of quaranjaviruses, which has implications for the management of these viruses in wild tick populations. 4.7 NIRVS are associated with the piRNA pathway in I. scapularis sRNA SPs are the key antiviral response in insects (Blair and Olson 2015) , yet current research is heavily biased towards mosquitoes. Several studies indicate involvement of an sRNA response in tick flaviviral infection (Schnettler et al. 2014; Weisheit et al. 2015 ), yet the area is understudied. In particular, the observation that NIRVS are proximal to piRNA clusters for a variety of arthropods suggests that NIRVS either (1) integrate into these clusters preferentially or (2) are positively selected for post-integration (Palatini et al. 2017; Whitfield et al. 2017; Ter Horst et al. 2018) . Interestingly, despite the identification of multiple NIRVS in I. scapularis in another study, no association with piRNA clusters was noted (Ter Horst et al. 2018 ). Repetition of this analysis for our own dataset uncovered a strong preference for integration into predicted piRNA sites in the I. scapularis genome (P ( 0.000001). Despite this discrepancy, our observation of many NIRVS-derived piRNAs, as discussed below, suggests that our clustering analysis was robust.\n\nThe second line of evidence for association with the piRNA pathway is the production of NIRVS-specific piRNAs. To investigate this phenomenon in the blacklegged tick, we analysed datasets from I. scapularis ISE6 cells (n = 4) for the presence of NIRVS-derived sRNAs. We found that NIRVS-derived sRNAs from all families (except a partiti-like insertion) were produced proportionally to their abundance within the genome (Fig. 7A ). Further analysis revealed that these sRNAs exhibited characteristics of primary piRNAs; specifically; they were primarily 25-0 nt in length, antisense, and had the canonical 1U piRNA bias ( Fig. 7B and C) . This strengthens the hypothesis that the NIRVS-piRNA association exists in I. scapularis as it does in other arthropods. Further studies can elucidate whether NIRVSderived piRNAs are upregulated upon viral infection, and whether suppressing the piRNA pathway confers an antiviral effect. Additionally, virus-specific piRNA production is known to differ between germ-line (the origin of the ISE6 cell line) and somatic tissues in most arthropods (Lewis et al. 2018) . Therefore, it would be interesting to determine whether these NIRVS-derived piRNAs are also produced in somatic tissues where an infecting virus encounters the tick's main antiviral defences.\n\n4.8 Non-LTR retrotransposons are the predominant TE class associated with NIRVS integration in I. scapularis\n\nThe production of cDNA from viral RNA is critical to the formation of an NIRVS. This requires RT activity, which is likely provided by the retroelements common in eukaryotic genomes (Holmes 2011) . Although the association between NIRVS and the piRNA pathway is clear for a variety of arthropods, analysis of the TE classes associated with NIRVS only exists for Ae. aegypti, where LTR retrotransposons are increased two-fold in NIRVS-rich regions (Palatini et al. 2017 ). Our analysis indicated that non-LTR retrotransposons were instead two-fold enriched (6.70 vs. 11.55%) in NIRVS-associated regions in the I. scapularis genome, while LTR retrotransposon sequences were not increased (0.64 vs. 0.87%) ( Table 4 ). This association corresponds to the diminished proportion of LTR retrotransposons in ticks (0.64% of the genome) compared with mosquitoes (about 15% in the genomes of Ae. albopictus, Ae. aegypti, and Cx. quinquefasciatus) (Chen et al. 2015; Gulia-Nuss et al. 2016) . Our data suggest that the RT activity of non-LTR retrotransposons, particularly I, L1, and R1 elements, which were increased in NIRVS-rich regions (Table 4) , might be responsible for NIRVS formation in ixodid ticks. However, further studies of the reverse transcription of viral RNA in tick cells is warranted to support this hypothesis.\n\nHere, we have provided novel insights into NIRVS in the genomes of important arbovirus vectors. Our data suggest that NIRVS in I. scapularis are distinct in both phylogeny and viral region of origin. Furthermore, our data indicate a link to the piRNA pathway in I. scapularis and an association with non-LTR retrotransposons. Due to the increased incidence of tick-borne viruses, further studies into how this affects tick antiviral immunity are warranted.\n\nSupplementary tables accompanying this text are available at https://arusso1.github.io/NIRVS/.\n\nSupplementary data are available at Virus Evolution online."}
