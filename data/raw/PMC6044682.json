{"title": "Preparation of Aluminum Oxide-Coated Glass Slides\nfor Glycan Microarrays", "body": "Glycan microarrays\nhave been used as an effective tool for the\nhigh-throughput analysis of protein\u2013glycan interactions and\nare thus useful for disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and vaccine\ndevelopment.1\u221228 Numerous surfaces have\nbeen made available for glycan arraying, including (a) noncovalent\nadsorption of sugar derivatives to the surface of a porous nitrocellulose\nmembrane;1\u22124,7,9,10,17,22,23,26 metal oxide surface;5 microtiter plate;\nfabricated plastics of polystyrene, polypropylene, or polycarbonate;\nand polyfluorohydrocarbon-linked aluminum oxide-coated glass (ACG)\nslides21 and (b) covalent attachment to\na gold surface or alkenthiol-activated gold surface,6,9\u221211,22 epoxy-activated glass\nslide,6,18,19,22,25N-hydroxysuccinimide\n(NHS)-activated glass slide,8\u221210,14,20,22,24,25 and ACG slide.15,21 The glycan array on ACG slides developed in our laboratory15,21 was prepared by spotting glycan\u2013phosphonic acids onto the\nsurface of the ACG slides,29\u221231 and the properties of the arrays\nwere characterized using both mass spectrometry and fluorescence scanning\nmicroscopy.15,21 The fluorescence intensity of\nsugar\u2013protein interaction on the ACG slide was found to be\nmore sensitive and homogeneous with higher glycan density than that\non the NHS-activated glass slides.14,15 We have further\nused the ACG slides to prepare a mixed-glycan array for the study\nof broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies isolated from HIV patients\nand found that some of the antibodies recognized two different glycans\nsimultaneously; a new observation that was not detected previously\nby the use of NHS-activated glass slides.28 In addition, the ACG slide surface can be used for noncovalent hydrophobic\nadherence of glycans with a fluorohydrocarbon tail for the identification\nand study of enzyme activity analyzed using MALDI mass spectrometry.16,21\n\nDespite all of these studies, the fabrication method for the\npreparation\nof ACG slides has not been clearly defined. In our previous study,\nthe anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) surface had properties and functions\nsimilar to those of the native aluminum oxide (NAO) surface.16 Different vapor deposition polymerization (VDP)\ntechniques have resulted in various degrees of surface roughness.\nEven the surface morphology of the ACG slides appeared different from\nthat of aluminum objects that have been widely used in industry.29,32\u221238 Previous surface treatment of aluminum objects involved mostly in-depth\nanodization for the control of pore sizes but not for the preparation\nof glycan microarrays. On the basis of our experience, the AAO surface\nto be used in glycan microarrays should have the following properties:\n(1) The aluminum oxide (Al-oxide) layer should be smooth enough for\nthe covalent coupling reaction with sugar derivatives of phosphonic\nacid.29,30 (2) The thickness of the Al-oxide layer\non the surface should be adjusted to provide optimal fluorescence\nintensity for the detection of the protein\u2013sugar interaction.\nIn this study, we use the glass slide with electron-beam (E-beam)-coated\naluminum to produce ACG slides with various thicknesses under various\nanodization conditions and then study their effect on the fluorescence\nintensity in sugar\u2013protein interactions. Mannose with an \u03b1-5-pentylphosphonic\nacid tail was\nused as a model compound for covalent attachment to the Al-oxide layer,\nand the fluorescence intensity of Alexa Fluor-488-tagged ConA (ConA-A488)\nthat interacts with the covalently bound sugar was used to evaluate\nand optimize the system. Computer software\nwas used to design experiments to fabricate the surface with various\nthicknesses and roughness of the AAO layer for the study. Data analysis\nof the result was conducted mathematically and used for the development\nof optimized conditions for the preparation of ACG slides.\n\nTo\ncharacterize the ACG slide to be used in a covalent glycan microarray,\nsugar loading capacity, uniformity, and spatial distribution of sugar\nderivatives on the surface were compared with those on the commercially\navailable NHS-activated glass slides using atomic force microscopy\n(AFM), a GenePix scanner, and confocal microscopes.\n\nGlycan microarrays are mostly used to study glycan\u2013protein\ninteractions with the goal of understanding the nature of the multivalent\ninteractions between the cell-surface glycans and the proteins they\ninteract with. Therefore, an ideal\nglycan array is one that best mimics the glycans that are found on\nliving cell surfaces. For example, the density and spatial distribution\nof Globo-H on malignant cells and their stem cells of breast cancer\npatients progressively increase. To identify the patients who would\nbenefit from vaccination with the Globo-H vaccine,39 to study the disease progression, and to monitor the antibody\nresponse to the vaccine in vitro, it would be useful if the glycan\narrays were able to mimic the changes on the cell surface at different\nstages of the disease. However, there is no such glycan array available\nto date as the cell surface is a dynamic and heterogeneous system\nwith variations in substrates on the surface, and as such the development\nof a glycan array to mimic the real cell surface remains a major challenge.\nNevertheless, the preparation of a surface for glycan array in a controllable\nand reproducible manner with regard to the distribution, density,\nand spatial orientation of glycans is important to address some fundamental\nquestions such as the avidity of weak binding and multivalent heteroligand\ninteraction. The glycan array on ACG slides has been shown to meet\nthese needs.\n\nSurface anodization of aluminum has been used in\nnumerous industrial\napplications mostly in the electrical oxidation of objects for pore\nsize creation, color-filling, pore-sealing and pore-polishing. The\nsurface anodization requires the use of strong acid such as sulfuric\nacid and long reaction time from hours to days. There are many reports\ndescribing the preparation of anodized Al-oxide surface with pore\nstructures varying from nanometers to micrometers,29,32\u221238,40 but little is known about the\npreparation of Al-oxide with smooth uniform thickness,36,41 as the ACG slide used for a glycan microarray requires a smooth\nsurface with low surface roughness.\n\nBefore a thorough study\nof surface anodization, we screened several\nVDP techniques to produce Al-oxide on metal-coated glass slides. These\nVDP screening studies included (1) Al-oxide of 50 nm thickness produced\nusing atomic layer deposition onto the Al-coated (with e-beam evaporation)\nglass slide; (2) Al-oxide of 2 nm thickness obtained from direct oxygen\nplasma treatment on a 300 nm thick aluminum (with e-beam evaporation)\ncoated on glass slides; and (3) Al-oxide of 36 nm thickness produced\nusing magnetron sputtering on the Al-coated (with magnetron sputtering),\nthe nickel-coated (with e-beam evaporation), or the chromium-coated\n(with e-beam evaporation) glass slides. All of these substrates were\nexamined using the GenePix fluorescent scanner. The original purpose\nof screening diversified methods was to create different Al-oxide\nmicrostructures on the surface to identify an optimal way to enhance\nthe signal. However, the best fluorescence intensity produced from\nthese slides was the AAO grown on glass slides. Without further investigation\nof the VDP techniques, we then focused on the use of E-beam evaporation\nwith argon plasma to coat a layer of pure aluminum on the glass slide\nfollowed by acid anodization of the aluminum surface. Our pervious\nstudy15 showed that the slide surface roughness\nwith rms (root mean square) < 18 nm can be used for microarray\nprinting. Schott\u2019s glass slides provided a smooth surface (rms\n0.33\u20130.42 nm scanned using AFM over 10 \u00d7 10 \u03bcm2 area) for aluminum coating. The Al-coated glass slides produced\nin this way have a smooth surface with a rms of 0.75 nm (for 100 nm)\nand 2.33 nm (for 300 nm) of coated aluminum. An optimized AAO surface\ngave a rms of 2.31 nm, with surface roughness similar to that of the\nAl-coated glass slide. The same results were obtained when glass slides\nwith higher rms were used for Al-oxide preparation. We believe that\nduring the electrochemical surface anodization, the electropolishing\nprocess42\u221244 occurred simultaneously to remove the convex, sharp,\nand rough materials from the surface. Therefore, a thin layer of AAO\nwith surface roughness similar to glass can be prepared under the\noptimized surface anodization reaction condition.\n\nFigure 1 shows a\nschematic drawing of the fabrication of an ACG slide to be used in\na glycan microarray. The clean 1 mm thick glass slide was coated with\npure aluminum (300 nm) in an argon plasma-assisted E-beam VDP coating\nchamber. Surface anodization was conducted via wet electrochemical\nreaction. The final optimized ACG slide contains a layer of anodized\nAl-oxide (approx. 50\u201365 nm) as measured using ellipsometry.\n\nA top view of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image\n(150 000\u00d7)\nof an AAO surface is given in Figure 2A in which the granular aluminum crystals underneath\ncould be seen and no pores were created. Unlike those surfaces with\nin-depth anodized alumina reported in the literature, the surface\nmorphology shown in Figure 2A looks similar to a surface with uniform distribution of\na thin layer of transparent Al-oxide. Figure 2B shows the cross section SEM image (80 000\u00d7)\nof the sandwich-like ACG slide. Its surface roughness, as shown in Figure 2C, scanned over 10\n\u00d7 10 \u03bcm2 using AFM was similar to the ordinary\nglass (<3 nm). In glycan microarray preparation, dispensing one\ndroplet (0.6 nL per spot) of sugar solution wetted out an area of\napproximately 150 \u03bcm in diameter, which covers approximately\n750 times the surface area, as shown in Figure 2A.\n\nTo produce a smooth AAO surface,\nthe anodization was conducted\nvia electrochemical reaction, by placing the Al-coated glass slide\nin an oxalic acid aqueous solution in a 4 \u00b0C incubator at controlled\nvoltage and reaction time. A 10 L oxalic acid solution (0.3 M) was\nprepared in stock to complete the entire study. As shown in Figure 1, the beaker (600\nmL) was filled up with the electrolyte, and the acid solution was\ncollected separately and reused.\n\nWe found that it is difficult\nto make a nontransparent Al-oxide\nlayer with an Al-coating thickness of just 100 nm. Visually, we can\nsee that the substrate fabricated from the 100 nm Al-coated glass\nslide was semitransparent. Therefore, Al-coated glass slides with\n300 nm of aluminum have been used in all surface anodization experiments.\nAs can be seen in the cross section image in Figure 2B, part of the aluminum has been converted\ninto Al-oxide. The final Al thickness was greater than 200 nm, and\nthe substrate was nontransparent.\n\nFigure 3 shows a\nmolecular model of mannose/ConA-A488 binding. Mannose with an \u03b1-5-pentylphosphonic\nacid tail was covalently bound to the surface of the ACG slide. The\nConA-A488 (c11252 from Invitrogen) was bound specifically to the immobilized\nmannose. Con A is a lectin tetramer with a subunit dimension of 42\n\u00d7 40 \u00d7 39 \u00c53, and each subunit has a mannose\nbinding site.45,46 Geometrically, only two binding\nsites per tetramer are available for mannose binding. The most effective\nmannose/ConA-A488 binding produces the strongest fluorescence intensity,\nand we have been using the fluorescence intensity of mannose/ConA-A488\nbinding to tailor-make the Al-oxide surface for the glycan microarray.15 Designed experiments were used to optimize the\npreparation of ACG slides for glycan microarray.\n\nAn optimized ACG slide should\npossess a smooth glasslike AAO layer,\nthus mild conditions for making the AAO surface have been selected\nfor investigation. By keeping the reaction temperature consistently\nlow (at 4 \u00b0C) and constant acid solution concentration (at 0.3\nM), the voltage and the reaction time were the only two reaction variables.\nTo screen the reaction parameters, two sets of experiments were conducted\nusing the computer software program Design Expert 8.0 (Supporting Information).\n\nWith the information\nobtained from the first two sets of designed\nexperiments (as shown in the Supporting Information), we are now able to define the ranges of voltage (9.8\u201345.2\nvolts) and reaction time (71.4\u2013198.6 s) for the RSM (response\nsurface measurement) experiment. The slides fabricated under these\nconditions were used to array mannose solution to form a 10 \u00d7\n12 array matrix with sugar concentration ranging from 100 mM to 1\npM. These experiments have essentially established the response in\nfluorescence intensity resulting from sugar/protein binding. For comparison,\nan NHS-activated glass slide was arrayed simultaneously using the\nin-house synthesized mannose derivative of \u03b1-pentoxylamine21 and was used to interact with the same ConA-A488\n(c11252 Invitrogen) protein solution (3 \u03bcg/mL) for the binding\nintensity study.\n\nThe results of response measurements are shown\nin Table 1. A total\nof 13 Al-coated glass\nslides were used in this set of experiments. The second and third\ncolumns are variable ranges of voltage and reaction time. The fourth\nto seventh columns are the measured data of AAO thickness, electrical\ncurrent, fluorescence intensity of arrayed mannose (100 \u03bcM)\nsolution with ConA-A488 binding, and maximum binding intensity (Bmax) for each glass slide prepared. The Bmax in column 7 of Table 1 was estimated using the fluorescence intensity\nobtained from 1 \u03bcM to 100 mM with GraphPad Prism 5.0. All mathematical\nmodels for each response measurement are given in Table S5.\n\nFigure 4A shows\nthe changes in electrical current and voltage versus reaction for\nACG slide no. 5 (Exp. number 5). The results of other slides are given\nin the Figure S3A. Figure 4B shows the images of a 10 \u00d7 12 matrix\nwith 10 repeated spots, with each column of the mannose solution concentration\nvaried from 100 mM to 1 pM across the row (also shown as ACG slide\nno. 5 in Figure S3B).\n\nFigure 4C\nshows\nthe response surface with respect to voltage and reaction. The AAO\nthickness is transformed into a modified quadratic function of voltage\nand reaction time with YAAO thickness = a \u00d7 (V)1/2 + b \u00d7 (RT)1/2; intercept \u2260 0. The modified\nquadratic mathematical functions of \u201cbioactivity\u201d (i.e.,\nthe fluorescence intensity and Bmax) with\nrespect to the fabrication factors (voltage and reaction time) are\nshown in Figure 4D,E.\n\nBoth Figure 4D (derived\nfrom experimental data) and 4E (derived from\ntheoretical calculation) have shown similar curvatures, indicating\nthat an optimal curvature of high fluorescence intensity within the\nrange of this study, there indeed existed reaction condition(s) for\nmaking ACG slides, which produced the highest fluorescence intensity.\nAdditional data of the ACG slide arrayed with various sugar concentrations\nare given in Figure S4.\n\nFigure 4D shows\nan example of the fluorescence intensity with 100 \u03bcM sugar concentration\narrayed on the ACG slide surfaces. The response surfaces of all sugar\nsolution concentration (as shown in Figure S4) were derived from the modified quadratic models (given in Table S5), with math equations either Yintensity = a \u00d7 V + b \u00d7 V2; intercept = 0, or Yintensity = a \u00d7 (V)1/2 + b \u00d7 (V2)1/2; intercept = 0, suggesting that voltage is\na critical variable in making \u201cgood\u201d ACG slides. From\nthe fluorescence intensity data, the voltages and reaction times used\nfor making the optimized ACG slides are thus defined.\n\nFigure 4E shows\nthe response surface of Bmax with respect\nto reaction conditions. To identify the optimal ACG slide surface\nfor the highest fluorescence intensity, Bmax was derived from the Michaelis\u2013Menten\u2019s equation,47Y = (Bmax \u00d7 X)/(Kd + X), where Y is the specific\nligand/protein binding [expressed as the fluorescence intensity of\nmannose solution concentration (varying from 1 \u03bcM to 100 mM)\narrayed on each ACG slide surface used in this system] and x is the concentration of the specific ligand (mannose)\nthat binds to ConA-A488. Bmax and Kd for each slide were obtained from GraphPad\nPrism. Model fitting of Bmax (using Design\nExpert) turned out to be YBmax = a \u00d7 V + b \u00d7 V2 (as given in Table S5). Both Figure 4D (derived from experimental data) and 4E (derived from theoretical calculation) have shown similar curvatures,\nindicating that an optimal curvature of high fluorescence intensity\nwithin the range of this study, there indeed existed reaction condition(s)\nfor making the ACG slides, which gave the highest fluorescence intensity\nof the same sugar/protein binding system.\n\nAs shown in Figure S3C (using the model\nfitting shown in Table S5), the electrical\ncurrent is also derived as a function of voltage, Ycurrent = a \u00d7 V + b \u00d7 V2; intercept\n\u2260 0. This derived mathematical equation has been deviated from\nthe theoretical prediction of linearity. As the ACG slide made at\nhigh voltages, its electrical current did not reach equilibrium and\ncontinually drifted upward; the model deviated from the theoretical\nprediction (Ycurrent = a \u00d7 V) is an indication of the heat-sink issue\nbefore large-scale anodization.\n\nThe predicted AAO thickness\nfor optimal intensity is given in Table 2. As indicated, the\nthickness for optimal fluorescence turned out to be 55 nm (\u00b111\nnm), and the predicted value using Bmax was 52.4 nm with the standard deviation of \u00b10.3 nm. Nonetheless,\nthe curvatures of the optimal regions in Figure 4D,E have been quite flat, suggesting that\nthe best AAO surfaces can be made within the ranges of the reaction\nconditions (voltages and reaction times).\n\nAs shown in Table 2, an optimized ACG slide contains a layer\nof AAO with 50+ nm on the\nsurface. It also showed that the optimized reaction conditions for\nmaking ACG slides are voltage between 25.8 \u00b1 0.7 volts and reaction\ntime between 135 \u00b1 21 s. The reaction temperature was set constantly\nat 4 \u00b0C using freshly prepared and up to the third repeated use\nof 0.3 M oxalic acid aqueous solution. Figure 5 shows the thickness variations of the AAO\nlayer versus the electrical current under the suggested optimized\nreaction conditions (25.8 volts, 121 s). With the glass slides obtained\nfrom different suppliers (Schott and Arrayit), 30 slides were fabricated\n(one slide at a time repeatedly) under this optimized reaction condition\nusing either freshly prepared or up to the sixth repeated use of the\noxalic acid solution. The surface roughness of the starting glass\nbase material (with rms 0.33\u20130.42 nm and 0.47\u20133.89 nm\nfor the glasses obtained from Schott and Arrayit, respectively) affected\nthe final rms (2.31 vs 4.56 nm) but not the thickness of the AAO layer.\nA few outliers in Figure 5 were obtained, where the ACG slides were fabricated on 2\nconsecutive hot days, where the reaction temperature was probably\nnot well maintained at 4 \u00b0C. The in-line voltage control (by\ngenerator) was recorded, and thus the electrical current was measured\nduring the fabrication of ACG slide. The thickness of the AAO layer\nwas analyzed using ellipsometry. As can be seen in Figure 5, the electrical current is\nlinearly proportional to the thickness of the AAO layer of the substrate.\nAlternatively, instead of using ellipsometry, the AAO thickness can\nbe estimated from the in-line electrical current measurement during\nthe ACG slide fabrication.\n\nIn summary, the thickness of the AAO layer grown\nfrom this system\nranged from 23.1 to 185.7 nm (at 15 volts/90 s and 50 volts/120 s,\nrespectively, as shown in the Supporting Information). There were no pores created during surface anodization for the\nformation of Al-oxide. Because the thickness of the coated aluminum\nlayer was only 300 nm, in 15 min of reaction time, all Al-oxide/aluminum\nlayers were dissolved and only the clear transparent glass slide remained.\nSurface roughness of the AAO layer fabricated within the experimental\nconditions ranged from 2.85 to 9.07 nm, as indicated in Figure S1A,C(b), all within the \u201ccapable\nregion\u201d (<18 nm) for glycan microarrays. At constant low\nreaction temperature (4 \u00b0C), the reaction time had a minor effect\non the thickness growth of the AAO layer, as indicated by the response\nmeasurement shown in Figure 4C. However, an optimized surface of the ACG slide (with rms\nat around 2 nm) was fabricated under the combined conditions of voltage\nand reaction time at 4 \u00b0C. Therefore, we proposed the AAO growth\non the Al-coated glass slide into two regions: (1) the \u201cmajor\nAAO growth\u201d (fast thickness increasing) region and (2) the\n\u201celectropolishing (surface smoothing) growth\u201d region,\nas presented in Figure 6A).\n\nFigure 6B shows\nthe comparison of fluorescence intensity of mannose/ConA-A488 binding\non ACG slides no. 5 from the RSM (response surface measurement) experiments\nvs the conventional NHS-activated glass slide. The ACG slide gave\nhigher fluorescence intensity than the NHS glass slide resulting from\nthe fluorescence tagged ConA binding to mannose on the surface. The\ndifferences in these two types of slides (ACG slide vs NHS glass slide)\nhave been investigated further.\n\nAs shown in Figure 7, the particle counts and particle height of mannose derivatives\non the ACG slide (rms 4.00 nm) and on the NHS glass slide (rms 1.02\nnm) were analyzed using AFM scanned over the matrix of 10 \u00d7 10\n\u03bcm2 area. Particle counts were obtained by counting\nthe number of particles above the height of one half width of the\nparticle height distribution. Mannose derivatives can be covalently\nbound to the surface only where the activated (either Al-oxide or\nNHS) functional groups are available. The ACG slide provides a surface\nof more uniformly distributed reactive sites for covalent reaction\nthan that of the NHS glass slide. Particle height changes on the slide\nsurfaces are summarized and given in Table S6. Higher rms indicated higher surface roughness of the ACG slide\nthan that of the NHS-activated slide. The mean height varied before\nand after sugar grafting and protein binding is an indication of conformational\nchange. Along this concept, as mannose was covalently bound on the\nslide surface, the mean, minimum, and maximum particle height on the\nACG slide were higher than those on the NHS slide, suggesting that\nthe mannose derivative existed in a more extended structural conformation\nperpendicular to the slide surfaces, as shown in Scheme 1.\n\nFigure 8A,B shows\nthe GenePix scanning images (at PMT 380) of ConA-A488 bound to mannose\n(1 mM) arrayed on the ACG slide versus the NHS-activated glass slide.\nAs can be seen, the Al-oxide surface has a higher sugar loading capacity\nsuch that the array spots are reaching saturation even at the very\nlow value of photomultiplier tubes (PMT) of 380. The fluorescence\nintensities of the averaged 20 spots for the ACG slide and NHS slide\nare given in Figure 8C. The GenePix scanner has a resolution up to 5 \u03bcm (25 \u03bcm2 per 1 pixel), and the dimension of the arrayed spots ranges\nfrom 60 to 250 \u03bcm in diameter with corresponding 110\u20131960\npixels, respectively. This has made it possible for us to access the\nuniformity/distribution of covalently bound sugars within an array\nspot. Figure 8D shows\nthe analysis of spot 1\u20135 (the first row and the fifth spot\ncounting from the right) of ACG versus NHS slides as shown in Figure 8A,B. The result from\nthe GenePix scanner recorded the spot dimension (Dia.), average fluorescence\nintensity per pixel (F488 Mean) with standard deviation (F488 SD),\ntotal fluorescence intensity of the spot (F488 total intensity), percentage\nsaturation (F488% sat.), and coefficient of variation within the spot\n(F488 CV) are tabulated in Figure 8D. Even though the individual pixel intensity cannot\nbe resolved visually with the naked eye, the coefficient of variation\nof pixel intensities (F488 CV) of 17 versus 65 indicates that the\nConA-A488/mannose distribution within a specific array spot on the\nACG slide is more uniform than that on the NHS glass slide.\n\nThe GenePix scanner has a maximum\nresolution of 5 \u03bcm, whereas\nconfocal microscopes have better resolution up to several hundred\nnanometers (1/2\u03bb). Figure 8E shows the confocal microscope images of ConA-A488/mannose\nbinding (Lica SP8) on ACG slide versus NHS-activated glass slides\nof approximately 30 \u00d7 30 \u03bcm2 within the spots\n(using Leica SP8). Consistent with the results obtained from GenePix\nfluorescence intensity and AFM scanning, the amorphous Al-oxide on\nthe ACG slide provides not only higher sugar loading capacity but\nalso more uniformly distributed glycan molecules on the surface. The\nACG slide should serve as a better surface for glycan array to facilitate\nour understanding of glycan\u2013protein interaction.\n\nA smooth surface anodization of aluminum-coated glass slide has\nbeen developed to fabricate the AAO layer with thickness optimized\nto 50\u201365 nm from the 300 nm aluminum-coated glass slide for\nthe glycan microarray. The fabrication of AAO layer has been considered\nin two regions: (1) the \u201cmajor fast AAO growth\u201d region\nand (2) the \u201celectropolishing growth\u201d region. At constant\ntemperature, the combined effects on voltage and reaction time are\nrelated to the thickness of AAO growth. Using the Con A/mannose binding\nsystem, the sugar loading capacity and uniformity/distribution of\nthe reactive site for sugar attachment to the ACG slide have been\ncompared with those of the NHS-activated glass slide. The ACG slide\nhas a surface that is more stable, higher loading capacity, and more\nuniformly distributed reactive site for sugar arraying through covalent\nphosphonate formation. This array system is more convenient to prepare\nand should be useful for the study of multivalent interaction and\nheteroligand binding in addition to the traditional use in the study\nof protein\u2013sugar interaction.\n\nThe\naluminum (99.999% purity)-coated glass slides were fabricated by the\nVacuum and Thin Film Technology Division, Instrument Technology Research\nCenter at the National Applied Research Laboratories, Hsinchu Science\nPark, Hsinchu, Taiwan. The VDP equipment of the ion beam-assisted\n(Veeco 16 cm RF ion source) E/B gun coater was assembled by the domestic\nF.S.E. Corporation. The glass slides were purchased either from Schott\nNexterion (Glass B cleanroom cleaned) or from Arrayit Corporation\n(SuperClean 2 Microarray Substrate SMC2) with nominal dimensions of\n75.6 \u00d7 25 \u00d7 1 mm3. The thickness of the coated\naluminum layer was fixed at 100 and 300 nm. After being coated with\npure aluminum, the slides were packed immediately (one slide per container\nunder the nitrogen atmosphere), vacuum-sealed with an air-tight laminated\nfoil, free from exposure to oxygen to prevent the formation of NAO,\nand kept sealed until the electrochemical reaction for surface anodization.\nThe thickness, surface roughness, and particle counts of the AAO layer\nwere analyzed using nondestructive ellipsometry (SOPRA ES4G) and AFM\n(Veeco di Dimension 3100 SPM), and the surface morphology and cross\nsection view were examined using SEM (FE-4300).\n\nThe electrochemical reaction\nwas conducted in 0.3 M oxalic acid aqueous\nsolution in a 4 \u00b0C temperature-controlled incubator. Inside of\nthe incubator, a thermocouple was dipped into the water-bath acid\nsolution to ascertain the reaction temperature. A plastic plate was\nfabricated in-house to hold the platinum electrode and a fixture of\nthe positive electrode such that the aluminum-coated glass slide could\nbe clamped or removed easily from the power supply (Keithley 2400).\nSurface anodization was controlled by voltage and reaction time varying\nfrom 9 to 54 volts and from 48 to 200 s, respectively, depending on\nthe designed experiment (using Design Expert 8.0). After surface anodization,\nthe slide was washed thoroughly with deionized water, purge dried\nwith nitrogen gas, and then annealed in a 100 \u00b0C oven for 10\nmin. After being cooled to room temperature, this ACG slide was stored\novernight in a 30% relative humidity chamber at room temperature,\nready for the following experiments.(a)AAO coating thickness analyzed using\nellipsometry (SOPRA ES4G).(b)AAO surface roughness analyzed using\nAFM, Veeco di Dimension 3100 SPM.(c)Microarray (BioDot AD3200G) and covalent\nformation of mannose-\u03b1-5-pentylphosphonic acid with Al-oxide\non the slide surface. The mannose derivative was dissolved in a 30:70\nratio of water/ethylene glycol mixture with solution concentration\n(depending on the experiments) varying from 100 mM to 1 pM (i.e.,\n12 samples with consecutive serial dilutions), microarrayed, and kept\nin a 80% humidity chamber for 2 h, then stored in a 30% HR chamber,\nready for protein binding analysis the next day.(d)Binding of ConA-A488 to mannose. ACG\nslides were loaded on the FAST frame (maximum of four slides per frame)\nwith each slide divided into 16 wells. The mannose derivative was\narrayed in 10 \u00d7 10 or 10 \u00d7 12 matrices per well (depending\non the experiments). The ConA-A488 (100 \u03bcL, 33 \u03bcg/mL)\nbuffer solution was filled into each well for sugar/protein binding,\nwhich took about 30 min to 1 h at room temperature. Following the\nincubation for sugar/protein binding, standard washing (three times\nbovine serum albumin/phosphate binding buffer, three times phosphate-buffered\nsaline/Tween buffer, and three times D.I. water) was conducted to\nremove the noncovalently bound sugar, mobile sugar bound protein,\nand any excess protein. The slide was dried carefully and subjected\nto a fluorescence intensity reading using a GenePix 4300A microarray\nscanner.(e)Computer analysis\nto obtain the optimized\nAAO fabrication condition. The reaction variables and response measurements\nwere analyzed (using Design Expert 8.0). Data analysis has revealed\nthe surface of AAO fabrication conditions with respect to the fluorescence\nintensity of sugar/protein binding on the surface.\n\n(1) Slide surfaces with covalently bound sugars\nwere examined under AFM. The outcome essentially gave information\non the sugar loading capacity and the uniformity of sugars on the\nACG slide compared with that on the NHS glass slide. (2) The conformational\ndifferences in the sugar derivatives covalently bound to the slide\nsurface were also examined via the particle height analysis using\nAFM. (3) The microarray sugar/protein binding data of individual spots\nwere examined using a GenePix scanner; within an arrayed spot, the \u201caverage\npixel intensity\u201d and its coefficient of variation (% CV) were\nreported. (4) The same sugar/protein binding slides were also examined\nunder a confocal microscope."}
