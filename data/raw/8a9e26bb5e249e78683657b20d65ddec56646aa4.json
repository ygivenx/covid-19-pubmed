{"title": "Screening Efficient siRNAs in vitro as the Candidate Genes for Chicken Anti Avian Influenza Virus H5N1 Breeding 1 CELL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY", "body": "Avian influenza virus (AIV) belongs to the family Orthomyxoviridae. Its genome consists of single stranded, negative sense RNA composed of eight seg ments that encode 10 or 11 proteins [1] . The virulence of AIV results in part from its ability to escape from protective immunity by antigenic drifts [2] and shifts [3] ; consequently, existing vaccines have only a limited value. And although many antiviral drugs have been approved for treatment and or prophylaxis of influ enza, their use is limited because of potentially severe side effects and the possible emergence of resistant viruses [4] . Development of a new rapid acting and effective antiviral strategy against AIV infection is therefore warranted.\n\nRNA interference (RNAi) has been used experi mentally to interfere with the replication of many ani mal viruses [5] [6] [7] [8] . Recent studies have also demon strated the utility of vector based siRNA expression driven by RNA polymerase III promoters such as U6 [9] [10] [11] .\n\nTransgenesis, in combination with RNAi to specif ically inhibit AIV gene expression, has been proposed 1 The article is published in the original. to make chickens resistant to avian influenza. How ever, the efficiency of gene silencing varies signifi cantly between siRNAs targeted to different positions of a gene [12, 13] . Until now, no consensus on choos ing the siRNA sequence has evolved, and it remains difficult to predict the best or most effective target site.\n\nIn this study, based on the mRNA sequences of AIV H5N1 subtype proteins, we designed five siRNAs by an online search tool combined with a series of bioin formatics programs. Their abilities to inhibit AIV rep lication have been investigated in stably transfected MDCK cells at the gene, protein and cellular mor phology levels. Our results indicated that they could be considered as powerful candidate genes for breeding transgenic chickens. EXPERIMENTAL Targets selection and plasmids construction. To design siRNAs that remain effective despite antigenic drifts and antigenic shifts, we focused on regions of the viral genome that are conserved among different H5N1 subtypes, with target regions having no more than 1 mismatch in regions of 21 nucleotides within all virus subtypes. Accordingly, the genes of A/duck/Fujian/13/2002(H5N1) NP, PA, PB1 and NS1 proteins (GenBank accession nos. AY585421, AY585463, AY585484, and AY585442) were selected to provide the targets for the siRNAs.\n\nFirst, siRNAs were sought using the online Target Finder and Design Tool (http://www.ambion.com/ techlib/misc/siRNA_finder.html) according to the following criteria: the sequence should be 50\u23af100 bp downstream of the start codon; avoid stretches of 4 or more polypurines or polypyrimidines; and with a GC content of 30-60%.\n\nSecond, to avoid potential off target silencing effects, a BLAST search was conducted against chicken and dog (for MDCK cells) genome sequences, and only candidate siRNAs with more than 4 nt mismatches against unrelated sequences were selected.\n\nThird, using the RNA structure 4.2 software (http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu) to predict the mRNA secondary structures of the AIV proteins, siRNAs were selected with target regions having no hairpin struc ture [12] . Hairpin like structures within siRNA can reduce the effective concentration and silencing potential of the siRNA, so the siRNA sequence cannot contain internal sequences or palindromic sequences that may form fold back structures. The relative stabil ity and propensity to form internal hairpins can be estimated by Primer Premier 5.0 (Primer Biosoft Inter national, Canada).\n\nThe final step in design was to calculate the hydro gen bond (H b) index of each siRNA, as described by [14] , and to select those that had the lowest H b index. The siRNAs sequences finally chosen are listed in table. psiSTRIKE (Promega) was used as the parental vector for constructing the U6 driven shRNA expres sion plasmids. The shRNA expression vectors were generated by inserting annealed oligonucleotides (synthesized by Sangon) which consisted of two com plementary sequences placed in opposition to each other with the insertion of a 9 mer spacer sequence.\n\nCell culture, transfection and stable selection. MDCK cells were grown in DMEM medium (Gibco) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin (pH 7.4) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO 2 . The cells were trans fected with the six shRNA expression plasmids respectively, using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invit rogen). The transfected cells were selected with 800 \u03bcg/ml G418 (Merck) for 3 weeks with medium changes twice one week. Individual colonies were picked and amplified in the same medium with 400 \u03bcg/ml G418. We detected the stability of the transfectants by PCR and northern blot, selected the transfectants which stably expressed the shRNAs for at least 5 continual passages, and maintained them as cell lines, stored every batches in liquid nitrogen for the subsequent experiments.\n\nFor the PCR detection, the genomes of the colo nies were extracted using Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (TransGen Biotech) and the following primers were used to detect shRNA gene insertion: 5' CGATACAAGGCTGTTAGAGA 3' (sense) and 5' CAGGCTTTACACTTTATGCT 3' (antisense). To detect the expression of shRNAs, total RNA was extracted from all transfectants with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and 20 \u03bcg aliquots were fractionated on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide 7M urea gels, then transferred onto positively charged nylon membranes (Amersham). After UV crosslinking, the membranes were probed with 32 P labeled DNA probe comple mentary to the antisense strand of the shRNA. Probed membranes were washed and exposed to autoradio graphic film (Kodak).\n\nA/duck/Fujian/13/2002 (FJ13), H5N1 subtype, was kindly provided by Professor Hongwei Gao (Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun). The virus was grown in MDCK cells, and virus titers were mea sured by a standard 50% cell culture infective dose (CCID 50 ) assay [15] .\n\nThe stable transfectants and control (untreated) cells were added to 24 well culture plates at a concen tration of 2 \u00d7 10 4 cells/well. Twelve hours later, all cells were infected with 100 CCID 50 (50% cell culture infectious doses) of FJ13. To detect the off target effect, all cells were infected with 100 CCID 50 of CPV 2 (stored by our laboratory), in parallel experiments. Supernatants were collected at 60h post inoculation (p.i.), and the virus titers were determined as CCID 50 on normal cultured MDCK cells.\n\nConfocal laser scanning microscopy and immuno fluorescence assay (IFA). Stable transfectants and control cells were grown on glass coverslips in 6 well plates. At 72 h p.i., the FJ13 coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilised with 0.2% Triton X 100 (in PBS) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with mouse anti HA mAb (kindly provided by Dr. M. Sun) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. After additional washes, the cells were incubated with FITC labeled goat anti mouse IgG (Sigma) for 1 h at 37\u00b0\u0421. For nuclear staining, cover slips were incubated with 100 \u03bcg/ml propidium iodide (PI) for 5 min at room temperature, washed, and mounted. Fluorescence was observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon TE2000 E).\n\nApoptosis assay by flow cytometry. At 24 h, 48h and 72h p.i. with 100 CCID 50 of FJ13, the stable transfec tants and control cells were trypsinized, washed and fixed in 70% ethanol at 4\u00b0\u0421 for 18 hours. Cells were then harvested and sequentially incubated with RNase A (100 \u03bcg/ml) at 37\u00b0\u0421 for 30 minutes and PI (50 \u03bcg/ml) at 4\u00b0\u0421 for 20 minutes. Cell samples were analysed in a flow cytometer (XL, Coulter), with the apoptotic cell population being identified by Pi stained DNA content. The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated using MCYCLE 2 software (Phoe nix, Germany).\n\nReal time quantitative RT PCR (QRT PCR) ana lysis. For quantitation of AIV replication in the stable transfectants and control cells from 24 h to 120 h (sampling every 24 h) following infection with 100 CCID 50 FJ13, total RNA was extracted from 250 \u03bcl cell lysate supernatants using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and QRT PCR was performed using SYBR \u00ae PrimerScript TM RT PCR Kit II (TaKaRa) and a DNA Engine Opticon TM 2 Real Time PCR Detector (MJ Research Inc., Waltham, MA). The specific primers used for identification of the HA gene were: 5' GCCATTCCACAACATACACCCTC 3' (sense) and 5' TTCCCTGCCATCCTCCCTC 3' (antisense).\n\nThe \u03b2 actin gene of MDCK cells was quantified as an internal RNA control. All measurements were nor malized to expression of the p actin gene, and the copies of HA gene mRNAs were quantified by com parison with a standard curve derived from known amounts of plasmids containing the HA gene (pEASY HA; pEASY vector provided by TransGen Biotech).\n\nDouble antibody sandwich indirect ELISA (DAS ELISA). To compare the differences in HA protein expression of AIV between the stable transfectants and control cells, supernatants obtained from 24 h to 120 h p.i. (sampling every 24 h) were analysed by DAS ELISA. For the DAS ELISA, the plates were coated with HA specific mAb (1:1000 dilution) at 4\u00b0C. After washing and blocking with PBST containing 1% gela tin (Sigma) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, assay samples (100 \u03bcl/well) were added and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The plates were then washed, and chicken anti FJ13 serum diluted 1 : 300 with antibody diluent was added into each well. The plates were then incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C followed by three washes, and goat anti chicken IgG HRP diluted 1 : 2000 (Sigma) in antibody diluent was then added to each well. After incubation for 1 h at 37\u00b0\u0421, the plates were washed, then incubated with TMB (3,3',5,5' tetramethylbenzidine, substrate of HRP). The reaction was stopped with 2 M H 2 SO 4 , and colour development measured in a kinetic microplate reader (Bio Rad model 550, USA) with a 450 nm fil ter. For standardization, known amounts of FJ13 (tested by CCID 50 ) were serially diluted twofold to 1 : 128 and assayed by DAS ELISA as above.\n\nStatistical analysis. All samples in the above exper iments were run in triplicate, and results are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. The significance of vari ability among the experimental groups was deter mined by one way or two way ANOVA using Graph Pad Prism R Version 4.0 software (San Diego, CA). Differences among experimental groups were consid ered statistically significant if P < 0.05.\n\nCharaterization Using ambion's online tool, we obtained 83 candi date siRNAs. After our local screening, we finally selected 5 rational ones for the subsequent experi ments. The secondary structures of the mRNA at the siRNA target regions were shown in Fig. 1a , and con structed five shRNA expression plasmids (pSi 604i, pSi 1442i, pSi 142i, pSi 740i and pSi 1597i). As a control, pSi 0i containing scrambled shRNA with no sequence similarity to the targeted genes was also con structed (Fig. 1b) and used to transfect MDCK cells.\n\nBy the selection of G418, thirty cell colonies (5 colonies for each plasmid) were isolated and ampli fied. After screened by PCR and northern blot, six sta ble transfectants (1 for each plasmid) were selected and maintained as cell lines (named NP 604, PA 1442, NS1 142, PB1 740, PB1 1597 and SCRM). PCR analysis showed that each cell line incorporated the sequence that contained the complete U6 pro moter and shRNA gene into its genome (Fig. 1c) . The result of northern blot dedicated that all the inserted genes could successfully transcript the shRNAs (Fig. 1d) .\n\nExpressed shRNAs The efficacy of shRNAs to inhibit AIV replication in stably tranfected cells was analyzed. For SCRM and control (untreated) cells, cytopathic effects (CPE) were evident even at 24 h p.i. with 100 CCID50 FJ13. In contrast, all stable transfectants obviously reduced susceptibility to AIV infection. Of the 5, NP 604, PA 1442 and PB1 1597 were the most effective, delaying the appearance of CPE until 72 h p.i., NS1 142 and PB1 740, however, showed weaker inhibition, but still significant compared to the controls. CPE at 60 h p.i. is shown in Fig. 2a . IFA analysis at 60 h p.i. showed that all 5 transfectants exhibited only a weakly positive response compared to SCRM and control cells, with NP 604 and PB1 1597 showing least viral antigen (Fig. 2b) .\n\nThe virus titers of supernatant samples collected at 60 h p.i. were determined. While titers in NP 604, PA 1442, PB1 740, PB1 1597 and NS1 142 cells were markedly reduced compared to controls, no signifi cant inhibition was observed in SCRM. No significant differences were observed among the virus titers of supernatants obtained from each well of CPV infected cells, indicating that there was no off target inhibition of other virus' replication in MDCK cells by the shR NAs chosen here (Fig. 3a) .\n\nThe apoptotic index indicated that significant dif ferences were exhibited between the stable transfec tants and control cells at all time points examined (P < 0.001), while there was no significant difference between SCRM and control cells (P > 0.05) (Fig. 3b) .\n\nQRT PCR analysis indicated that the mRNA le vels of the HA gene in NP 604 and PB1 1597 cells decreased markedly compared to controls at all time points p.i. (P < 0.001); PA 1442, PB1 740 and NS1 142 showed relatively weaker inhibition effects after 72 h p.i. (P < 0.05). No significant differences were exhibited between SCRM and control cells (Fig. 4a) .\n\nThe results of DAS ELISA revealed that the HA protein level in all specific targeting transfectants decreased significantly compared to the control cells (P < 0.001), with NP 604, PB1 1597 being the most effective, they showed markedly inhibition effects until 120 h p.i. PA 1442, PB1 740 and NS1 142 showed relatively weaker inhibition effects after 96 h p.i. No significant differences were observed between SCRM and control cells. (Fig. 4b) . DISCUSSION Although a set of guidelines for the selection of potential siRNA duplexes has been proposed [16] [17] [18] , there are no reliable methods for selecting the effective target regions without practical test. It is well known that different siRNA duplexes induce different levels of RNAi activity [5, 12] . Thus, it is important to screen appropriate target regions conferring a strong RNAi activity within the AIV genome. Among avian influ enza viruses, extensive differences in nucleotide sequences are present in different subtypes. To design shRNAs that remain effective despite antigenic drifts and antigenic shifts, therefore, we focused on regions of the viral genome that are conserved among different H5N1 subtypes. Influenza NP, PA and PB1 are essen tial early proteins during viral replication, providing ideal targets for RNAi [4] . NS1 protein has been reported to have anti RNAi activity [19] , and there fore inhibition of NS1 protein may suppress this acti vity. Consequently, we chose NP, PA, PB1 and NS1 as our target proteins. No siRNAs for HA and NA were designed due to the extensive variations in these genes among different virus strains.\n\nIt is known that the target position, the secondary structure of mRNA at the target site and the off target effect are major considerations in the design process. There are many online selection methods, but most are rather unselective as to candidate genes. Here, we combined an online search tool with a series of bioin formatics programs, and set a series of parameters for designing the siRNAs, thereby considerably narrow ing selection of candidate siRNAs and permitting easy choice of the most rational ones.\n\nIn this study, we dedicated to make the stable trans fectants for the siRNAs' inhibitory detection, because if the percentage of transient transfection was lower than 30%, it would be difficult to detect inhibitory effection [20] . Another aim for us to make the stable transfectants is that we wanted to detect psiSTRIKE vector's recombine ability with the host cells' genome. Because we wanted to use them for making transgenic chickens, we must firstly demonstrate whether they could recombine with the host cells' genome or not.\n\nIn summary, our experiments have shown that all siRNAs selected by our design method were capable of effectively inhibiting AIV replication in vitro, all trans fectants except SCRM markedly inhibited AIV repli cation at any time points post infection and delayed the appearance of CPE. In particular, transfectants NP 604 and PB1 1597 displayed a marked resistance to AIV replication, they showed markedly inhibition effects for about 120 hours. If the transgenic chickens which contained these genes also have the same resis tance to AIV replication, the acute mortality induced by highly pathogenic AIV infection would be remark ably decreased. And, this resistance could earn time for the early immunity's response.\n\nIn our experiments, we also infected the transfec tants by another subtype (H9N7) of AIV. They showed inhibitory effects, but not very markedly (data not shown), probably by the presence of some mismatches between the siRNAs and viruses' genome.\n\nRNAi has been used experimentally to interfere with the replication of many animal viruses, but the challenge now is how to apply them conveniently, effectively and economically in poultry industry. Since siRNAs are negatively charged and do not readily cross cell membranes, local injection, such as using chemically synthesized siRNA or shRNA expressed plasmids may not be effective and economical for industrialized usage. So, using shRNA expression plasmids to create transgenic chickens would be more practicable, we have demonstrated that psiSTRIKE U6 shRNA plasmids can be integrated with the chicken genome (data not shown), and experiments using the direct intra ovarian injection method [21] are in progress. The mRNA levels of AIV FJ13 were analyzed by QRT PCR, all measurements were normalized to expression of the \u03b2 actin genes, and the copies of HA gene mRNAs were quantified by com parison with a standard curve derived from known amounts of pEASY HA. (b) Differences in HA protein expression of AIV between the stable transfectants and control cells were detected by DAS ELISA. For standardization, known amounts of FJ13 (tested by CCID 50 ) were serially diluted twofold to 1 : 128 and assayed as above. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001."}
