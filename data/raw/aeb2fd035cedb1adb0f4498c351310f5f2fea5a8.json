{"title": "Open and Closed Structures Reveal Allostery and Pliability in the HIV-1 Envelope Spike", "body": "antigenic mimics of the pre-fusion native, surface-presented Env 3, 4 , targets of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Thus, they are attractive immunogens for vaccine development [for review see [5] [6] [7] [8] ]. Here we present high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structures of subtype B B41 SOSIP Env trimers in complex with CD4 and antibody 17b, or with antibody b12, at resolutions of ~3.7 \u00c5 and ~3.6 \u00c5, respectively, and compare them to cryoEM reconstructions of ligand-free B41 SOSIP Env trimers or in complex with either CD4 or CD4bs antibody PGV04, at ~5.6 \u00c5, ~5.2 \u00c5 and ~7.4 \u00c5, respectively. Consequently, we present the most complete description and understanding of the CD4/17b-induced intermediate and provide the molecular basis of the receptor-binding induced conformational change required for HIV-1 entry into host cells. Both CD4 and b12 induce large, previously uncharacterized conformational rearrangements in the gp41 subunits, and the fusion peptide becomes more buried in a newly formed pocket. These structures provide key details on the biological function of the type I viral fusion machine from HIV-1 as well as new templates for inhibitor design.\n\nNumerous biophysical studies have provided a framework for CD4-induced Env conformational changes through a combination of low-resolution cryo-electron tomography of membrane-embedded trimers 9,10 , x-ray crystallography of gp120 monomers 11 , and more recently hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) 12 and F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) 13 experiments into the dynamics of Env (see Supplementary Discussion for more details). To study the molecular basis of conformational changes resulting from binding of receptor to HIV-1 Env, we obtained a cryoEM map of fully glycosylated B41 SOSIP.664 14 (a solubilized and stabilized version of Env) in complex with two-domain soluble CD4 (sCD4) and the CD4-induced antibody 17b at ~3.7 \u00c5 resolution (B41 CD4/17b ) ( Fig. 1a ; Extended Data Fig. 1 ; Extended Data Table 1 ). We also obtained a ~5.6 \u00c5 cryoEM map of ligand-free subtype B B41 SOSIP.664 (B41 LF ) and show it to be structurally comparable to subtype A BG505 (Extended Data Fig. 2c-f ). Like BG505 SOSIP.664, B41 SOSIP.664 is a stable, native-like trimer that induced autologous neutralizing antibody responses in rabbit immunization studies 15 but can adopt slightly more open conformations (partially open) when analyzed by negative-stain EM, and has a lower melting temperature compared to BG505 14, 16 (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b) . Despite differences in their biophysical properties, the structure of B41 LF (Extended Data Fig. 2f ) adopts a closed, pre-fusion conformation nearly identical to the analogous BG505 SOSIP.664 structure (PDB 4ZMJ) 17 .\n\nOur structure of B41 CD4/17b elucidates the molecular details of receptor-induced conformational changes, including rearrangements of the V1/V2 and V3 loops, and neverseen-before changes in gp41, including repositioning of the fusion peptide ( Fig. 1b ; SI Video 1). In our B41 CD4/17b cryoEM map that contains the complete gp120, most of V1/V2 that extends parallel to CD4 is disordered in the region that was truncated in the core gp120 construct used for crystallography (residues C131 to N187) (Extended Data Fig. 3b ). Despite the presence of 17b, whose epitope overlaps the co-receptor binding site, much of the V3 loop beyond the base is also disordered.\n\nCD4/17b binding induces subtle changes in a network of conserved residues (>96% of sequences in the Los Alamos database) in the gp120 core similar to previous observations in gp120 monomers 11, [18] [19] [20] (Fig. 2a ; SI Video 2; Extended Data Table 2 ). These changes propagate across gp120 to the C1 region (residues 63-72; \u03b10), which is poorly ordered in pre-fusion Env trimer structures ( Fig. 1b; Fig. 2c ). \u03b10 adopts a stable alpha-helical conformation via transit into a pocket that was sterically occluded by the close juxtaposition of gp120 and HR1 in gp41 in the closed, pre-fusion trimer (Extended Data Fig 3d; SI Video 3). An additional rearrangement of two mannose residues in the D1 arm of the highly conserved N262 glycan into a new pocket underneath the base of V3 further stabilizes the helical conformation of \u03b10 and establishes a direct link between the co-receptor binding site and gp41 ( Fig. 2c; Extended Data Fig. 4c ). Due to the rotation of gp120, \u03b10 now caps the HR1 helix (\u03b17) of the gp41 subunit from a neighboring protomer, which was previously capped by \u03b11 in gp120 from within a protomer (Fig. 2b) . The functional role of \u03b10 that we describe here supports a different conclusion than one based on a recently published lowresolution structure of CD4 bound to an Env trimer in a closed conformation claiming that CD4 makes specific contacts with C1 in the adjacent protomer 21 . In our structure, all of the highly conserved residues claimed to interact with CD4 during its initial pose form intra-gp120 stabilizing interactions in the open CD4-bound structure presented here (Fig. 3d) . Mutation of these residues lead to a loss of infectivity 21 ; in light of the present work, likely due to destabilization of the conformation competent for co-receptor binding.\n\nAdditional cryoEM reconstructions were produced to test the effect of sCD4 alone on Env conformational changes, and compare a with a different Env genotype, BG505 (Extended Data Fig. 1d ). Within the limits of resolution we observed only slight differences, whether B41 or BG505 SOSIP was used, and whether 17b is present or not (Extended Data Fig. 3c , Extended Data Fig. 4d ). The V3 loop remains unresolved in reconstructions of B41 or BG505 SOSIP in complex with sCD4, suggesting that sCD4 alone is responsible for the gp120 rearrangements and exposure of the co-receptor site, and suggesting that 17b does not induce further conformational changes (Extended Data Fig. 4f ). VRC01-class antibodies 22 bind the CD4bs but do not induce global conformational changes in the Env trimer while another CD4bs neutralizing antibody, b12, has been shown to engage Env in a different manner 9, 14, 23 . To better understand the conformational changes induced by b12, we generated cryoEM structures of B41 SOSIP.664 in complex with either CD4bs antibody PGV04 (B41 PGV04 ) or b12 (B41 b12 ) to resolutions of ~7.4 \u00c5 and ~3.6 \u00c5, respectively ( Fig. 4a ; Extended Data Fig. 1 ; Extended Data Fig. 5a , c). While B41 PGV04 was nearly identical to BG505 SOSIP.664 in complex with VRC01-like antibodies, B41 b12 promoted a large-scale change in Env away from the closed pre-fusion conformation similar to B41 CD4/17b (Extended Data Fig. 5b, d, e) . Specifically, B41 b12 exhibits a large rigid body movement of all three gp120 subunits with respect to the trimer axis and concomitant rearrangement of the gp41 helices (discussed below) ( Fig. 4c ; Extended Data Fig. 5d ). Despite the gp120 rearrangements, the V3 loop remains sequestered beneath V1/V2 and the co-receptor binding site is inaccessible ( Fig. 4b ; Extended Data Fig. 6b ). Thus, while b12 makes similar interactions with Env as CD4 it does not induce a conformational change in V1/V2 relative to gp120 ( Fig. 4b ; Extended Data Fig. 4e) . Notably, the subtle rearrangement of mannose residues in the N262 glycan observed in B41 CD4/17b is not seen in B41 b12 , and density for the \u03b10 region is highly disordered. Thus, functional progression of the Env requires both a rigid body movement of gp120 and CD4-induced allosteric changes within gp120 to expose the co-receptor binding site. Unlike CD4, b12 is sterically occluded from binding the closed pre-fusion conformation of Env (Extended Data Fig. 4b ; Extended Data Fig. 6c-f ), suggesting that transient opening of the trimer is required for b12 epitope exposure. Upon binding, b12 prevents reversion back to the closed pre-fusion state (Extended Data Fig. 6d ).\n\nGlobally, both CD4/17b and b12 result in gp41 rearrangements that, in the case of the former, prime for further transitions to facilitate fusion with the host-cell membrane. The HR1 three-helical bundle begins to open up at the base, causing the N-terminal half of the HR1 peptide (HR1 N ) to move away from the center of the trimer (Extended Data Fig. 7g ). This movement coincides with formation of a stable helix in the fusion peptide proximal region (FPPR) and HR1 N that packs against HR2 (Extended Data Fig. 7h ). Additionally, gp120 C1 (V36-P43) and C5 (starting at I491) regions undergo a similar movement in the same direction to avoid clashing with \u03b19b of HR2. Finally, HR2 tilts upward and, when modeled onto the surface of a virion, would be more perpendicular to and somewhat lifted off the membrane compared to the pre-fusion state.\n\nOne of the major consequences of the movement of gp120 relative to gp41 is the formation of a new pocket close to the trimer core that, in B41 b12 and B41 CD4/17b , houses the fusion peptide (FP). FP, which is fully resolved to the N-terminal residue A512 in B41 b12 and L515 B41 CD4/17b , undergoes a large conformational rearrangement upon entry into this pocket , and is stabilized by many newly formed interactions. For example, K574, which forms a salt bridge with D107 of gp120 in the closed pre-fusion state, undoes this interaction upon translocation of \u03b11 induced by CD4/17bbinding, but forms a cation-\u03c0 interaction with gp120 F53 ( Fig. 3b ; Extended Data Fig. 7a ). All three residues (F53, D107, K574) are >99% conserved and the interplay between them likely contributes to two stable states (Extended Data Table 2 ). In fact, mutational analysis demonstrates that introduction of an F53A mutation not only decreases infectivity but also leads to greater gp120 shedding 18, 24 . The gp120 interface with gp41 \u03b17 in B41 CD4/17b is further stabilized by highly conserved residues that do not make any productive interactions in the pre-fusion state (Fig. 3b) . Finally, despite the larger conformational change, conserved phenylalanine residues in the FP and FPPR provide additional stabilizing interactions (Fig.  3e ). In addition to formation of new contacts, the intermediate state exemplified by B41 CD4/17b also retains some stabilizing features of the closed pre-fusion state ( Fig. 3c ; Extended Data Fig. 7f ). Altogether, this extensive network of interactions between highly conserved residues suggests that the CD4/17b-bound state represents a stable, fusion intermediate wherein the fusion peptide is embedded inside the trimer distant from the host membrane and therefore requiring further triggering by co-receptor engagement.\n\nThe Env trimer on the surface of HIV must maintain a fine balance between stability until a target cell is reached and the ability to trigger and undergo conformational rearrangement that drives fusion. Our studies describe Env, even when stabilized by SOSIP mutations, as a dynamic molecule that fluctuates between closed and open pre-fusion states. In the open conformation, we now see that the FP is structured and sequestered near the core of the trimer. We hypothesize that the FP may transition between solvent-exposed and sequestered conformations based on \"breathing\" in the trimer. The structure of FP in our b12-or CD4/17b-bound structures could therefore be used to inform structure-based design of stabilized or cyclic fusion peptide mimetic inhibitors of HIV 25, 26 .\n\nFinally, we show that CD4bs neutralizing antibodies can prevent exposure of the co-receptor binding site in both the open (e.g. b12) or closed conformation (e.g. VRC01) by restricting movement of the V1/V2 loops (Extended Data Fig. 8) . CD4, on the other hand, induces a series of allosteric changes that propagate across gp120 and expose the co-receptor binding site. While the co-receptor binding site is accessible in the CD4-bound structure, it is unclear how further conformational changes in the trimer are triggered by interaction with CCR5/ CXCR4, although the glycan at N262 and formation of \u03b10 likely play a role in signal transmission. Based on the disposition of the co-receptor binding sites three copies of CCR5 27 could bind to the trimer in this conformation. Interestingly, CCR5 forms a crystallographic dimer in the x-ray structure 27 that when docked on top of our trimer structure spans across two gp120 subunits and could potentially interact with two coreceptor binding sites simultaneously (Extended Data Fig. 8 ). Overall, our structural studies have unlocked the molecular details of the first step in the CD4 receptor-mediated fusion process of Env, but the role of the co-receptor remains to be elucidated.\n\nProtein expression BG505 SOSIP.664 and B41 SOSIP.664 trimers were expressed by transient transfection (cotransfected with furin) in HEK293F (Invitrogen; mycoplasma-free) and purified as previously described using 2G12-affinity and size-exclusion chromatography 28, 29 .\n\nThe two N-terminal domains of human CD4 were cloned into vector pHCMV3 with an Nterminal Ig-kappa secretion signal and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag for expression in HEK293F. One liter of 293 Freestyle cells was transiently transfected with 0.5 mg of DNA. After 7 days, the supernatant containing the secreted protein was applied to a 5ml HisTrap \n\nBG505 SOSIP.664 were mixed with a 10X molar excess (sCD4:trimer) of sCD4 for 2 hr at room temperature. For complexes containing 17b, a subsequent incubation was performed with a 10X molar excess (Fab:trimer) of 17b Fab for 1 hr at room temperature. The complex was purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using Superose 6 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare) in TBS (0.05 M Tris pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl). The fractions containing the complex were pooled and concentrated using a 100-kDa concentrator (Amicon Ultra, Millipore) to ~40 \u03bcL at 1 mg/mL. 5 \u03bcL of the complex was incubated with 3 \u03bcL of a fresh DDM solution at 1.8 mM. A 3 \u03bcL aliquot of the complex was applied to a C-Flat grid (CF-2/2-4C, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Protochips, Inc.) which had been plasma cleaned for 5 seconds using a mixture of Ar/O2 (Gatan Solarus 950 Plasma system), blotted off, and then immediately plunged into liquid ethane using a manual freeze plunger.\n\nThe same procedure was used to prepare the B41 complexes except that the incubation time of trimer and ligand(s) was increased to ~18 hrs prior to SEC. This long incubation time increased stoichiometry of binding for ligands with slow on-rates and did not have an effect on overall trimer stability judged by the lack of dimers or monomers in both SEC peaks and EM classifications.\n\nFrozen-hydrated samples were inserted into a Titan Krios electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, Oregon) operating at 300 kV. Data was collected through the Leginon software solution [30] [31] [32] . Each micrograph movie was collected at a magnification of 22,500, which resulted in a pixel size of 1.31 \u00c5 in the specimen plane. Micrograph movies were acquired using a K2 direct detector camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, California) operated in counting mode with 200 ms exposure per frame. Dose rate was ~10 e-/pix/sec and defocus range was \u22121.0 to \u22124.0 \u03bcm. Micrograph movie frames were aligned and dose-weighted using MotionCor2 33 . CTF models were calculated using GCTF 34 .\n\nMolecular projection image candidates were then identified in the aligned micrograph movies using DoG Picker 35 . Reference-free, 2D classification was performed using identified projection image candidates binned by a factor of two via iterative multivariate statistical analysis and multi-reference alignment 36, 37 . Particles corresponding to class averages of the molecular complexes were selected for further processing in Relion version 2.0 38 . Initially, full-size molecular projection images were refined against a simulated density map of an unliganded BG505 SOSIP Env trimer (simulated from the Env part of PDB ID 5CEZ) low-pass filtered at 60 \u00c5. Initial refinement was followed by 3D classification and stable symmetrical classes were selected for further symmetrized (C3) refinement. Resolutions were calculated using soft-edged masks that encompassed the entire structure (including all noisier regions) and are reported according to the FSC 0.143 goldstandard criterion. Final resolutions are ~3.6 \u00c5 (B41 b12 ), ~3.7 \u00c5 (B41 CD4/17b ), ~5.2 \u00c5 (B41 CD4 ), ~5.6 \u00c5 (B41 LF ) and ~7.4 \u00c5 (B41 PGV04 ).\n\nSingle particles were selected using DoGPicker 35 from the whole-frame aligned and summed micrographs and used to create an initial raw particle stack after removing regions of the micrographs containing gold or large areas of aggregation. The raw particle stack was extracted using a box size of 256 pixels, and was immediately binned by 2 in reciprocal space, to a pixel size of 2.62 \u00c5/pix and a box size 128 pixels. Initial 2D classification in Relion indicated a mixture of particle populations from sub-stoichiometric binding of sCD4 and 17b. Particles contributing to classes that did not produce clear structural features were discarded, leaving 98,845 particles. Next, to separate the different particle populations, this stack was subjected to competitive sorting using 3 initial models -trimer alone, trimer + sCD4, trimer + sCD4 + 17b Fab -in an identical manner as previously described 39 . This resulted in three separate stacks containing 69,105 particles (trimer alone), 6,342 particles (trimer + sCD4), and 23,398 particles (trimer + sCD4 + 17b). Each of these individual stacks was then subjected to 4-model classification in Relion, using 60 \u00c5 as the initial low-pass filter value 38 , followed by parameter conversion and final classification in Frealign 40 . For each subgroup, the number of classes in Frealign was varied from 2 to 4, and a final value was selected such that the classification would produce at least 2 nearly identical models, as described earlier 41, 42 . Within the stack comprising the trimer alone or the trimer + sCD4, this procedure resulted in removal of bad particles that did not produce interpretable maps ( Figure S5C ); within the stack comprising the trimer + sCD4 + 17b, this resulted in 1 low resolution class that was discarded, as well as 3 classes that differed in the relative configuration of the 17b Fab, but that were otherwise very similar. Final resolutions (FSC 0.143) are ~10.5 \u00c5 (BG505 CD4 ), and ~8.6 \u00c5 (BG505 CD4/17b ).\n\nModel building and refinement steps followed those previously described 43 . Briefly, initial homology models of B41 gp120 and gp41 were generated using Modeller 44 and the crystal structure of ligand-free BG505 SOSIP.664 (PDB: 4ZMJ) as a template for B41 LF and B41 b12 , while the crystal structure of gp120 bound to sCD4 and 17b (PDB: 1GC1) was used to model gp120 of B41 CD4/17b . Coordinates for sCD4, 17b, b12, and PGV04 were obtained from PDB IDs 1GC1, 1RZ8, 2NY7, and 3J5M, respectively. Individual chains were fit into the respective cryoEM maps using UCSF Chimera 45 and refined using a combination of Rosetta density-guided iterative local refinement 46 , RosettaRelax 47 , and manual building in COOT 48 . Glycans were built using an idealized Man9 model that was placed into corresponding glycan density in UCSF Chimera. Torsion angles were adjusted in UCSF Chimera until good agreement was achieved between map and model. Sugar molecules with disordered or no density were removed. The final models were further refined using Phenix 49 real space refinement without NCS constraints. Glycans were validated by pdbcare 50 and CARP 51 and structures were evaluated using EMRinger 52 and Molprobity 53 . Figures were generated in UCSF Chimera or Pymol 54 . Buried surface area calculations were performed using PDBePISA 55 and R.M.S.D. analysis was performed in UCSF Chimera. Map fitting cross correlations were calculated using the Fit In Map feature in UCSF Chimera.\n\nA stock of B41 SOSIP.664 was thawed on ice and 3 \u03bcL were adsorbed onto a Cu400 carboncoated grid for 10 s before blotting, and then stained for 60 s with 2% (w/v) uranyl formate. The remaining stock was then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr on a heat block. 3 \u03bcL were removed and immediately adsorbed onto a carbon-coated grid followed by staining. The stock was again incubated on ice for 1 hr before a third grid was prepared using the same method. Data were collected and processed as described in Pugach et al., and de Taeye et al. (a) Major contacts between b12 Fab and gp120 highlighted based on the cryoEM model. Sequence alignment between BG505 and B41 Env for a segment of V2, with N-linked glycans colored green. (b) Alignment of gp120 in complex with b12 from the cryoEM and x-ray crystallography models (PDB 2NYZ) (left). The crystal structure of b12 Fab docked into the B41 b12 cryoEM map, revealing that the elbow angle is preserved (middle). When aligned to gp120, the x-ray model reveals a slightly different b12 angle of approach with respect to the cryoEM model (right). These differences may arise due to a more stable, neutralization resistant Tier-2 virus (B41) versus a more flexible lab-adapted Tier 1 BaL pseudovirus, the stabilizing SOSIP modifications used in the soluble constructs (although none are located at the CD4bs epitope or gp120 core), or the low resolution of the cryoET map. (c) The pre-fusion arrangement of gp120 does not allow for b12 binding to B41 SOSIP. 664 due to clashes between the framework regions of the antibody and portions of a neighboring gp120 monomer (V3 and glycans). (d) Rotation of the N197 glycan requires the gp120 subunits to open up and move away from one another. (e,f) Glycan N197 in the b12 epitope acts as a steric barrier in the pre-fusion state and rearranges and moves away from the b12 epitope to allow for b12 binding. It is only after binding of CXCR4/CCR5 to CD4-bound Env that additional fusion steps occur, highlighted by the full formation of a three-helix bundle before final condensation into a six-helix bundle. When a dimer of CCR5 from a crystal structure is docked on top of the trimer structure, the N-termini of the two co-receptors are situated proximal to the coreceptor binding sites on gp120.\n\nExtended Data Table 1 CryoEM and model refinement statistics. \n\nNumber of atoms in deposited model gp120 10,341 9,150 n/a n/a n/a gp41 3,312 3,270 n/a n/a n/a b12 5,547 n/a n/a n/a n/a 17b n/a 5,514 n/a n/a n/a SCD4 n/a 4,113 n/a n/a n/a glycans 1,551 1,689 n/a n/a n/a MolProbity score 1.92 1.93 n/a n/a n/a Clashscore 5.54 6.27 n/a n/a n/a EMRinger score 2.44 2.38 n/a n/a n/a RMSD from ideal Bond length (\u00c5) 0.010 0.010 n/a n/a n/a Bond angles (*) 1.13 1.18 n/a n/a n/a Ramachandran plot Favored (%) 86.95 88.80 n/a n/a n/a\n\nB41_CD4_17b B41_LF B41_CD4 B41_PGV04\n\nAllowed (%) 12.42 10 .76 n/a n/a n/a Outliers (%) 0.63 0.43 n/a n/a n/a Average B-factor 72 92 n/a n/a n/a Extended Data Table 2 Conservation of key amino acids based on Los Alamos HIV Database HIV-1 Env sequences from major subtypes.
