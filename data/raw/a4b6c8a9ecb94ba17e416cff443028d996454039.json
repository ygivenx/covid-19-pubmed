{"title": "Advice-giving in newspaper weather commentaries", "body": "Following the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in 2003 and an increasing string of extreme weather events, the People's Republic of China Emergency Response Law was adopted in 2007, and in 2008 the weather emergency management system established new protocols for weather monitoring, warning and information sharing (Yang and Mao, 2012) . Importantly, the China Meteorological Administration developed an information sharing mechanism that also includes the Xinhua News Agency, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the State Administration of Radio Film and Television. Thus, full use of newspapers, radio and television, as well as new media outlets, has become a vital part of Chinese disaster communication (Yang and Mao, 2012) .\n\nWeather information has been an important resource utilised by Chinese newspapers to attract readers ever since their first appearance in China in 1882 (Ye and Chen, 2011) . To meet the needs from agriculture, industries, commercial www.elsevier.com/locate/pragma expectations between teacher and student. Culpeper et al. (2008) found that while mentors in general seem to value optionality and solidarity-enhancing talk over directive and authoritative discourse in their interactions with foreign language assistants, mentors in France favoured solidarity-enhancing discourse, coupled with a directive style, to a greater extent compared to those in England. Similarly, through the linguistic analyses of vignettes, DeCapua and Dunham (2012) examined the types of advice-giving and the relational strategies employed by students preparing to be teachers of young children. They concluded that the type and frequency of components of advice-giving vary according to topic, that the components interact with each other to set the tone of advice, and that relational strategies work to mitigate the threatening force of advice-giving, promote bonding and good relationships between the advice-giver and seeker. Both Angouri (2012) and Vehvil\u00e4inen (2012) have focussed on ''problem-solving'' interactions featuring direct questions. Vehvil\u00e4inen found that Finnish supervisors use question-answer sequences (i.e. question preface) to allow the student's knowledge and perspective to surface; insight that in turn can be used to tailor the advice, and thus minimise the lilkelihood of the advice falling on deaf ears.\n\nIn health-related or medical contexts, Heritage and Sefi (1992) and Heritage and Lindstr\u00f6m (2012) observed home visits with first-time mothers. Heritage and Sefi observed that mother-initiated advice is infrequent and could be in the form of straightforward question-answer sequences or in a more cautious and indirect way by describing a state of affairs as problematic. Advice-giving initiated by health visitors, on the other hand, occur much more frequently and often in a stepwise way. Interestingly, Tully et al. (1997) found that consumers and pharmacists have different ideas concerning who needs advice and when and how advice should be given. Zayts and Schnurr (2012) studied how medical providers interactionally manage the tension between giving advice and ensuring patient autonomy, typically by framing their responses as giving information rather than giving advice. They are also more direct when patients' advice-seeking is framed as questions around other aspects than the medical decision. Based on their research of two Internet advice columns on sexual health, Harvey et al. (2013) claimed that advice-giving is a delicate act to carry out because of ''inescapable messages of authority, expertise and intimacy in advice' ' (DeCapua and Huber, 1995:128) and is thus generally considered to be face-threatening in Anglo-western contexts (Goldsmith and MacGeorge, 2000; Vine, 2004) . Therefore, they proposed the importance for advice-givers to think about linguistic strategies to mitigate the threatening force of advice-giving. Harrison and Barlow (2009) showed that the face-threatening aspects of advice-giving can be successfully addressed in peer-to-peer advice-giving through indirect strategies, such as indirect suggestions framed as declaratives or rhetorical questions. This study, which focused on online self-management for people with arthritis, made a special note of the use of personal narratives, which serve both as an indirect strategy for giving advice, and a positive politeness strategy demonstrating shared concerns and experiences.\n\nAdvice-giving in call-in radio advice programmes is commonly framed by mitigation strategies; for example, hosts tend to avoid direct language forms by adopting the same terms as clients when describing a third party's advice (Hudson, 1990; Pudlinski, 2005) . They also use hedges (e.g. maybe) and the imperative, when inquiring about a further more specific safe course of action, and refer to an expert when clients implicitly seek advice. DeCapua and Dunham (1993) revealed that hosts prefer to use explanations, elaborations and narrations to help clients' advice-seeking. Going further, Pudlinski (2012) described how hosts can pursue advice that is initially rejected by the caller. He identified three sequential and functional strategies: interrogating for information about the caller's own experiences, supporting the advice with additional accounts, and expressing concern or worry to further extend advice pursuit. Drescher (2012) identified some cultural differences after comparing patterns of advice-giving in phone-in programmes in French and Cameroonian cultures, while Emmison and Firth (2012) concluded that the delivery of advice is often constrained by particular institutional practices. In an investigation of online Spanish peer-to-peer advice-giving, Placencia (2012) identified Guidance as the core move. In her study of advice letters on the Internet, Locher (2006) noticed an overall preference for hedging as a face-saving strategy. Morrow (2006) analysed online British texts and uncovered an informal style of advice-giving, expressing positive regard and solidarity. Following this study up, Morrow (2012) turned to Japanese advice-giving on the internet. He observed that generally advice is framed in polite question forms and that advice-givers often take an empathetic stance by recounting their own experiences and using first person plural volitional forms.\n\nThere have been a number of studies on forms and strategies of advice-giving in Chinese, though none in the context of weather. Wu (2008) posited that advice-giving strategies are determined by power, reflecting the power relation between the advice-giver and the advice-receiver, while Fang (2005) found that the advice-giving forms or strategies students use vary with power and social distance, as well as solidarity. Comparing advice-giving in Chinese and English, Lu (2014) discovered that Chinese speakers think about the social power relationship much more than English speakers. Yan (2011) revealed that most advice-giving speech acts in forum response posts on the issue of love on the Internet are direct and are framed in the form of imperatives (see Li, 2009 for a historical account of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic forms of advice-giving). Similarly to Waring (2007 Waring ( , 2012 , Ren (2013) found that adviser-initiated advice is enacted in a typical sequence: pre-advising (i.e. making comments, inquiring, etc.), advising, and post-advising (i.e. providing explanations). The pre-and post-advising act to build an appropriate environment for the act of advising and enable the advising act to be performed successfully.\n\nTo our knowledge, there are no previous studies of advice-giving in newspaper weather commentaries, nor of whether the discourse differs depending on the newspaper source and/or on the weather being reported. This study aims to fill this gap, thus offering new insights into how newspapers can give effective instructions or advice. To this end, we investigated advice-giving in two Chinese metropolitan newspapers, and sought to answer the following research questions:\n\nAre there differences in degree of advice-giving between different newspapers (i.e. does one newspaper provide more advice), and is advice-giving linked to the type of weather? How is advice-giving distributed in the weather commentaries? Is it sequential? Is the distribution governed by weather and choice of newspaper? What are the themes of advice-giving? What is the typical mood choice for advice-giving? Is the choice of mood dependent on newspaper source and weather conditions? How are interpersonal relationships displayed in advice-giving through the use of addressing terms, such as sh\u00ecm\u00edn and p\u00e9ngy\u01d2 u?\n\nTwo Beijing local metropolitan newspapers were chosen for this study: Beijing Morning Post(BMP) and Beijing Evening News (BEN). These are consistently ranked among the top most widely circulated metropolitan newspapers in Beijing, according to Soubaoad, a national newspaper website that displays information about top national and local newspapers, including the distribution ranking list (Soubaoad, 2012 (Soubaoad, , 2013 . BMP sells about 340,000--500,000 copies per day (Baidu Encyclopedia, 2014a) and BEN distributes some 1,000,000--1,200,000 copies per day (Baidu Encyclopedia, 2014b) . The e-versions of these newspapers are accessible online and are identical to their counterpart hardcopies.\n\nMoreover, both newspapers have half or sometimes even an entire page dedicated to weather forecast information, which includes coloured maps, fact tables and weather indices, as well as special commentaries. The content of the commentaries not only cover basic weather information about the temperature, the sunshine and the wind, but also include comments and advice based on analysis of weather tendencies, meterological knowledge and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).\n\nWe selected weather commentaries published between 22 March 2012 and 28 February 2013. The number of words in each text ranged between 447 and 629 words in BMP and 303 and 1127 words in BEN. Altogether 80 texts were chosen (see Appendix), 40 from each newspaper. Of these 40 selected commentaries, 20 texts were about ordinary weather, i.e. the kind of weather that would usually be expected during the month and season in question, and the other 20 texts were from days featuring extreme weather events.\n\nFor ordinary weather, all texts were exactly matched for publication date. However, since some of the extreme events occurred on a weekend when BEN does not publish weather commentaries, some of the extreme weather texts were from different dates (see Appendix). The corpus covered the extreme weather events that happened from 20th March 2012 to 19th March 2013, namely two strong winds which were reported to have caused serious damage to public facilities and properties, a flood that killed 79 people (Wang et al., 2013b) , an abnormally early snow storm (Wang et al., 2013a) , as well as the unprecedented severe smogs in January 2013 (Wang et al., 2014) .\n\nThe following are typical examples of weather commentaries from the two newspapers. After each example, we will briefly outline the contents and structure of the text, as well as highlight examples of advice-giving.\n\nExample 1 (from BMP)\n\nB\u011b ij\u012bng r\u00f9qi\u016b le.

Actually from feeling, citizen friends have earlier already felt it has entered autumn. Consecutive days autumn cold, meterological data also give definite this year entry autumn time. If according to the previous standard, the city of Beijing this year is on 9th month 14th day, i.e. last Sunday entered autumn; If according to the new standard, should be advance two days, last Friday entered autumn. Yesterday dawn, Nanjiao Observatory lowest temperature already dropped to 12.1 8C, Mentougou lowest temperature dropped to 6 8C. Cold autumn feeling, cover the city of Beijing. Beijing this year autumn entry time according to the new standard relatively ''punctual''; according to the previous standard is than usual year's entry time 9th month 5th day late 9 days. With Beijing hand-in-hand accompany, northern large areas all already entered autumn.\n\nToday the day cloudy turn to overcast, west and north have thunder shower, the highest temperature although is 25 8C, but morning evening still cold enough. Also pay attention today morning the plain area has light fog, visibility is not good, drive showly.\n\nTwo-day weekend day really not bad, basically all sunny days, the highest 26 8C--27 8C, suitable outing for fun. From next week, sky again overcast, maybe has shower attack Tuesday, the day temperature also sit on slide drop to only 21 8C, drop temperature obvious. Autum in Beijing is very short, citizen friends should seize time enjoy early autumn beautiful views, because if not careful, cold winter will speedy horse strengthen whips arrive.\n\nWeather cold, autumn fat has affixed, some friends find seem to have over-affixed fat, this time, had better choose barley tea, papaya, sweet potato, raddish, or hawthorn to help clear stomach.]\n\n[English Translation: Beijing has entered the season of autumn. Actually, [My fellow] citizen friends must have already felt the arrival of autumn from the cool air in recent days. Also, the meteorological data [of these days] has actually predicted the definite arrival date of this autumn: 14th September, i.e. last Sunday, if according to the previous standard; last Friday, if based on the new standard. At dawn yesterday, the temperature at Nanjiao Observatory dropped to 12.1 8C, with the lowest reaching 6 8C at Zhaitang in Mentougou District. The autumn cool filled the city of Beijing. Autumn arrived in Beijing relatively on time this year according to the new standard, but it was 9 days late if compared to the usual arrival date, i.e. 5th September. Like Beijing, the majority of other northern areas [of China] have seen autumn, too.\n\nDuring the day today, it is going to be cloudy and then overcast later. A thunder shower will be expected in the west and in the north. Although the highest is going to be 25 8C, it is chilly early in the morning and late in the evening. In addition, it is going to be a little foggy in the plain areas and the visibility will be low. Drive slowly.\n\nThis weekend will have two beautiful sunny days, with the highest ranging 26 8C--27 8C, and it is fit for a day out. From next week, it will be overcast. Possibly there will be a shower on next Tuesday and the temperature will drop to 21 8C. Autumn is short in Beijing. [My fellow] citizen friends had better take time to enjoy the early beautiful autumn, as the cold winter will arrive very soon.\n\nWith the days getting cool, we have gained some weight. However, some friends may find themselves to have become overweight. In this case, it would be good to take some barley tea, papaya, sweet potato, radish, or hawthorn to help clear the stomach.] (BMP, 19th September 2014) This BMP text starts with an overview of recent weather tendencies, focussing on autumn in Beijing and its similarity to previous years. There is also a review of the previous day's weather and in the recent days. The next part is the forecast, i. e. the weather prediction for today. Before moving on with a second forecast that predicts the weather over the weekend, the writer includes the advice: ''Drive slowly''. This advice is brought on by the forecasted fog and low visibility. There is further advice given after the weekend forecast, namely to enjoy the autumn as winter is coming, as well as the more implied advice: ''it is fit for a day out''. The final section is the ending (i.e. independent additional advice), which details dietary advice for readers who have gained too much weight.\n\nIn sum, the sequence of components in this text is: (1) overview, (2) review, (3) overview, (4) forecast, (5) forecast, and (6) ending. Noticeably, the two overviews and the review are interwoven and recursive, making it hard to separate these components. We count four instances of advice-giving in this example that occur in the two forecasts and in the ending.\n\nJ\u012bnti\u0101n y\u00edngl\u00e1i le gu\u00f3 q\u00ecng ji\u00e0q\u012b y\u01d0l\u00e1i zu\u00ecw\u00e9i m\u00edngm\u00e8i de y\u012bti\u0101n.

Thereafter, a forecast focusing on the weather for the afternoon. Here, implicit advice is offered: ''a lovely day out''. Finally, a second forecast.\n\nIn sum, the sequence in this text is: (1) overview, (2) review, (3) forecast, and (4) forecast. There is only one instance of advice, located with the first forecast.\n\nHasan's Generic Structure Potential (1984, 1985, 1996) was utilised to categorise the advice themes in the texts and to analyse the structural organisation, where special attention was paid to the frequency and location of advice. The UAM CorpusTool (O'Donnell, 2012) was also used to assist in the statistical annotation of texts.\n\nBased on the assumption that genre is a type of discourse, Hasan investigated the structures of genres, which led to her proposed theory for genre analysis: Generic Structure Potential (GSP). According to Hasan, the GSP of a genre consists of obligatory elements and optional elements, which appear in a linear sequence. The function of optional elements may account for the variations in the texts that belong to the same genre. In this case, a single GSP can generate a large number, or if recursion is involved, an infinite number of actual structures with the variable realisation of each element. In other words, a potentially infinite number of actual texts can occur as exemplars of the same genre. Hasan's GSP allows a systemic and consistent description of generic structures of instances of texts in terms of the elements included. Since some elements may be common to different genres, and the more elements two genres share, the more similar they will be.\n\nWeather commentaries seem to be made up of four types of components (or moves): overview (lead-in statements summarising the general weather conditions and tendencies --past and future), review (statements regarding the most recent weather), forecast (predictions of future weather), and ending (independent additional advice). As the two examples in Section 2.2 show, advice-giving can occur in the forecast or the ending, and Example 5 further below illustrates how advice can be incorporated into the overview component of the weather commentaries. Our examples also show that a component can occur more than once in a commentary. As our analysis in Section 3.2 below will show, we found that most of the time the overview and review components are so intertwined that is not always possible to separate them. We therefore merged these two into one component: overview.\n\nQualitative analysis was carried out in stages. First, the authors agreed an initial coding scheme, before the second author, who is a native speaker of Chinese, coded all the data independently and proposed a revised coding scheme based on the finding of four advice components. Next, the second author translated examples of commentaries for the first author to code. The authors discussed differences and similarities in coding practice, and further examples were translated verbally and scrutinised. Thereafter, the coding scheme and a multitude of examples were presented to discourse analysts fluent in Chinese, and feedback was received. Finally, the final coding scheme was agreed, and all the data was re-coded by the second author and jointly agreed with the first author.\n\nQuantitative analysis was carried out with the use of SPSS 19. Analysis was predominantly descriptive. Since the total number of words in each article of BEN varied considerably, all word counts were normalised by a 500-word factor to make the data comparable and meaningful (Rundblad, 2007) . Thus, all counts presented in this paper are normalised counts. Where the distribution of a particular linguistic feature was normal, we used a univariate ANOVA to determine whether the use of that feature was dependent on the newspaper source and/or on the type of weather.\n\nThe annotation of the texts (Table 1) revealed that both newspapers tended to offer more advice for extreme weather than for ordinary weather and that during ordinary weather, BMP, in particular, gave comparatively little advice. A univariate ANOVA confirmed that while newspaper source had no effect independently or in an interaction (newspaper*weather), the type of weather did significantly predict higher advice-giving for extreme weather (F (1,76) = 11.413; p < 0.01).\n\nAdvice-giving is a general strategy used in weather commentaries to interact with and attract readers. According to an online investigation conducted by China Weather Web (2011) among 3589 people in Beijing, up to 45% of those surveyed pay close attention to the effect of weather on general health and certain diseases; 25% care about weather for travel and outdoor activities; 25% are concerned with weather information for proper (thick or thin) clothing. Thus, the Chinese public very much welcome experts' instructions on how to cope with and prepare for different types of weather. During extreme events, we can presume an even greater awareness (for both the author and the reader) of the link between weather and well-being and the effect that can have on human daily life and social activities.\n\nThe significant increase in the number of advice instances during extreme weather events in both BMP and BEN demonstrates the importance both newspapers attach to weather-based advice-giving in emergencies. In China, it is very common that the general public do not have sufficient knowledge as to how to cope with extreme weather events. For instance, during the disastrous flood on 21 July 2012, which was the worst flood in over 60 years, many of those who were caught in the heavy rain panicked because they had never experienced such a big flood before (Wang et al., 2013b) . In addition, the rescue system collapsed. As a result, 79 people in total died in the flood, including a driver who was drowned because he stayed in his car and was subsequently unable to escape, as well as two young university students who chose to swim across a flooded bridge. It is possible that if they had benefitted from professional instructions or advice before the event, they might have stood a better chance at survival. It is quite likely that events such as this one have (or will) gear the Chinese newspapers to offer more substantial weather-based advice during extreme events in the short-term and climate change in the long-term.\n\nAnalysis revealed an uneven distribution of advice-giving ( Table 2 ). The first possible place for advice-giving was in the overview. The overviews focussed typically on recent weather conditions, and/or typical weather tendencies for this season. Thus, the overview included statements about what we should expect in the next few days based on seasonal information, which is different to the forecast. The overview also functioned as an introduction to the rest of the commentary, and the advice found in this component was often more generic, being based on seasonal patterns (see Example 5 below). Not surprisingly, only a few instances of advice-giving were found in the overview component.\n\nAs the main purpose of the weather commentaries is to predict the weather, it is not surprising to find that the forecast is the most prominent, and compulsory, component in the commentaries. It is also in the forecast that we found the majority of advice and instructions, all related to the future local weather. As illustrated in Example 3, some authors prefer to start the weather commentary with the forecast, especially in the case of extreme weather, and most often with related advice coming directly after.\n\nExample 3\n\nY\u00e1nh\u00e1n ti\u0101nq\u00ec h\u00e1iz\u00e0i ch\u00edx\u00f9, j\u012bnti\u0101n sh\u00ec j\u00ecny\u012bdu\u00e0n sh\u00edji\u0101n l\u01d0 de ''d\u012bg\u01d4 '',g\u00e8ng b\u00e0ny\u01d2 u s\u00ecw\u01d4 j\u00ed b\u011b if\u0113ng, f\u0113ngh\u00e1n xi\u00e0oy\u00ecng ji\u0101ng chu\u012bde w\u01d2 men bi\u00e0nt\u01d0 sh\u0113ngh\u00e1n. j\u012bnti\u0101n sh\u00ec zh\u014duli\u00f9, m\u00e9iy\u01d2 u sh\u00e9nmo t\u00e8bi\u00e9 sh\u00ecq\u00edng de p\u00e9ngy\u01d2 u b\u00f9f\u00e1ng xu\u01ce nz\u00e9 zh\u00e1i z\u00e0i ji\u0101zh\u014dng, b\u00f9y\u00e0o ch\u016bm\u00e9n \u00e1id\u00f2ng le.\n\n[Word-by-word rendering: cold weather still is continuing, today is recent time ''low valley'', also accompanied by 4 or 5 force scale north wind, wind cold effect will blow us all over grow cold.

Don't go out to suffer the piercing cold.] (BMP, 8 December 2012)\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 1 the mean number of instances of advice in the forecasts was noticeably higher in BEN during extreme weather (M = 3.89). When querying whether newspaper source and/or the type of weather impacted inclusion of advice here, we found that both factors impacted usage (weather: F (1,76) = 9.024; p < 0.01; newspaper: F (1,76) = 4.268; p < 0.05). No interaction was found. In other words, BEN used more advice in its forecasts, regardless of the type of weather, and during extreme weather events both newspapers increased their advice-giving significantly.\n\nThe sharp increase we saw earlier for commentaries as a whole during extreme weather events was probably linked to the rise in advice in the forecast component of the commentaries. With regards to BEN, it is now clear that this newspaper generally featured greater degrees of advice in the forecasts. This might be due to the self-positioning of BEN writers. BEN writers seemed to portray themselves as experts or authorities who are supposed to possess more meteorological knowledge --which was typically found in the forecast component -than ordinary people, and who are responsible for offering relevant advice to lay people. Another popular place for advice-giving was the ending. The popular topics here were a healthy diet, health care and disease prevention during the specific season in question. The advice in the ending was more independent from its adjacent prior weather content. Example 4 illustrates two instances of ending advice.\n\nExample 4\n\nZu\u00f3 ti\u0101n, n\u00e1nji\u0101o gu\u0101nxi\u00e0ngt\u00e1i zu\u00ecg\u0101o q\u00ecw\u0113n 23.3 8C, sh\u00ecq\u016b q\u00ecw\u0113n 24 8C. . .xi\u00e0zh\u014du ji\u0101ng ch\u00edx\u00f9 du\u014df\u0113ng, y\u00f9j\u00ec zh\u014du'\u00e8r zh\u014dus\u0101n q\u00ecw\u0113n ji\u0101ng y\u01d2 u su\u01d2 xi\u00e0 ji\u00e0ng.

Health care experts recommend ubiquitous radish for internal heat reduction. Radish can help to relieve stagnation, regulate qi, strengthen the stomach and clear away the internal heat and sputum. For the best effect, the radish should be eaten raw or as radish soup. [Health experts] also recommend lotus roots and tomatoes. . .] (BMP, 7 April 2012) In terms of the distribution of instances of advice in the endings, it is worth noticing that while BMP followed what now seems to be the general weather advice pattern with more advice during extreme events, BEN supplied no advice at all in the endings during extreme weather. This non-use is probably due to advice in the ending usually being relaxing health care suggestions or recommendations that very often are independent from the rest of the commentary (Example 4). Such advice would not serve the serious or emergent tone of advice-giving favoured in BEN, especially not during adverse weather. In sum, the typical GSP of Chinese weather commentaries could be summarised as: (overview)^forecast^(ending). 1 In this linear structure, the overview and the ending are optional elements; whereas the forecast is obligatory. We discovered that advice often occurs after information related to future weather in each component. Although, we were forced to merge overview and review into one component, it is worth mentioning that we found no instances of advice in this component that related to past weather. Possibly this was because such advice would be useless or that the relevant advice had already been included in the forecast component the day before.\n\nThe texts in the corpus demonstrated a rich variety of advice in terms of the themes. One major theme for advice content was concerned with the distinctive variety of the local climate as illustrated in Examples 5 and 6.\n\nExample Example 5 was advice for the spring, when frequent blustery winds and drought might lead to advice-giving to guard against the risks of falling objects from high buildings and forest fires. Moreover, Example 6 illustrates that the unreliable temperatures in the spring generated another advice theme about proper dressing to guard against the well-known sharp gaps between the highest and the lowest temperatures.\n\nExample 6\n\nJ\u00ecnq\u012b b\u011b ij\u012bng l\u011b ng k\u014dngq\u00ec hu\u00f3 d\u00f2ng p\u00ednf\u00e1n, gu\u0101f\u0113ng r\u00ecsh\u00f9 du\u014d, q\u00ecw\u0113n q\u01d0f\u00fa d\u00e0, Sh\u00ecm\u00edn p\u00e9ngy\u014fu y\u00e0o g\u0113nj\u00f9 ti\u0101nq\u00ec bi\u00e0nhu\u00e0 j\u00edsh\u00ed z\u0113ngji\u01ce n y\u012bw\u00f9, qi\u0101nw\u00e0n bi\u00e9 zh\u00e1o li\u00e1ng.\n\n[ In summer, medical advice is of great importance to those who are susceptible to certain diseases that are liable to occur in this season as shown in Example 7.

When autumn is beginning to approach the end, people tend to feel sad and lonely in autumn as depicted ever since ancient times, especially so on continuous rainy days. Apart from local climates, TCM was found to be another source of inspiration for advice-giving. TCM theorists believe that body functioning, health maintenance and even dietary habits have close connection with various weather conditions and with the seasons or times of the year. Active adaptation to the change of the seasons in terms of life style and diet can help keep fit and prevent diseases. The failure to do so may result in health decline and eventually in diseases. Accordingly, the corpus revealed that health care or dietary habits based on TCM were popular topics in advice-giving as shown in Example 11.\n\nExample 11\n\nJ\u012bnti\u0101n ''d\u014dngzh\u00ec'', qi\u00e0f\u00e9ng xi\u01ce oxu\u011b . . .. . .zh\u014dngy\u012b r\u00e8nw\u00e9i y\u01ce ngsh\u0113ng y\u012bng y\u012bnd\u00eczh\u00ecy\u00ed.

To sum up, the climate and TCM contributed to the abundant contents of advice. The topics of advice ranged from clothing, driving, hiking, sunscreening and outdoor activities, to precautions against bad weather, warnings of potential risks, instructions for prevention of certain diseases caused by certain types of weather, and tips on health care or diet according to different times of seasons in a year.\n\nImperatives were found to be a very popular mood choice in general. As Table 3 highlights, the writers in both newspapers tended to use more imperatives to give advice during extreme weather conditions than on ordinary weather days. A univariate ANOVA supports this observation (weather: F (1,76) = 9.847; p < 0.01). We did not find a significant effect for newspaper, nor an interaction between the two factors.\n\nThe usage of imperatives on days of extreme weather might be linked to the writers' self-positioning in relation to putative readers. High usage implies that the writers were consciously or unconsciously considering themselves in a superior position in terms of professional expertise. As illustrated by Advice 1--5 in Example 9, the commentators present themselves as weather forecast experts or authorities on weather who have much more professional knowledge compared to the reader. Thus, the writers tend to use imperatives to offer direct advice, especially in the case of extreme weather, to make the advice sound more authoritative, more reliable and especially more urgent. This leaves the impression that the addressee has no other option but to follow the advice for the sake of the addressee's own benefit or safety. 3.5. Sh\u00ecm\u00edn (citizen) and p\u00e9ngy\u01d2 u (friend) as addressing terms\n\nAnother important linguistic pattern was the mixed use of the high-status vocative sh\u00ecm\u00edn and the equal-status vocative p\u00e9ngy\u01d2 u (Table 4 ). It should be noted that, technically, these two terms are not mutually exclusive; in fact, several instances of combined use was found in the corpus.\n\nAs shown in Example 12, sh\u00ecm\u00edn indicates that the writer had a higher social status or more power than the reader. By addressing the reader with sh\u00ecm\u00edn, the writer was above all positioning himself as an expert or authority on weather, for the purpose of making the advice-giving more authoritative or reliable so that the audience would feel secure or confident to follow the advice.\n\nExample In terms of usage (Table 4) , sh\u00ecm\u00edn was particularly favoured by BEN, and again we can see an increase in use for extreme weather. This means that there was a greater tendency for the weather commentators from BEN to make themselves sound more authoritative, and with it, the advice they gave.\n\nUnlike sh\u00ecm\u00edn, the use of p\u00e9ngy\u01d2 u (pl. p\u00e9ngy\u014fumen = friends) indicates an equal relationship, i.e. equal social status, power or authority (Example 13). As friendship means equality, trust, and intimacy, the use of this term creates the feeling of closeness or intimacy between the writer and the reader, which might definitely have a positive effect on the reader's willingness to accept and act upon the advice.\n\nExample 13\n\nJ\u012bnch\u00e9n zu\u00ecd\u012b q\u00ecw\u0113n j\u01d0ny\u014fu 5 8C, h\u00e9 b\u00e1iti\u0101n zu\u00ecg\u0101o q\u00ecw\u0113n ch\u0101 15 8C, p\u00e9ngy\u014fumen b\u00f9f\u00e1ng z\u01ce ow\u01ce n ti\u0101ny\u012b, b\u00e1iti\u0101n ji\u01ce ny\u012b. . . . . .

Interestingly, this usage pattern was not affected by whether the commentary was reporting on ordinary weather or an extreme weather event. This may indicate that BMP writers defined themselves in an equal position to their readers, which logically should not change depending on the weather. Alternatively, they might make a conscious choice to keep the writer-reader status equal during extreme weather in the hope that ''friendly'' advice is more palatable, ensuring greater compliance with the advice.\n\nde Beaugrande (1997) has claimed that weather report texts have low informativity. Therefore, advice-giving in such texts should, by extension, be even more limited in content, as it is just a minor part of this genre. This study sought to address differences and similarities in advice-giving and advice themes between two different Beijing newspapers, and in particular asked whether the type of weather commented on affected the degree of advice-giving. Our results reveal that weather related advice-giving was abundant, especially during extreme events. In terms of content, the variety of climate facts and the vast reservoir of medical theories on health contributed to a large number of advice themes in the weather commentaries: from ordinary weather to extreme weather, from daily activities to special occasions, from everyday health care to prevention of seasonal diseases. Thus contrary to de Beaugrande's presumption, Chinese weather forecast texts are highly informative, with the quantity and quality of weather-related advice varying reliably and appropriately in accordance with the present weather.\n\nA second objective for the present investigation was to determine the distribution of advice-giving across the three structural components of weather commentaries, and whether the type of weather affected this. While many of the weather commentaries also contained an overview and an ending, it is the forecast section in the middle that dominates. This confirms that the main communicative purpose of these commentaries is to forecast the immediate future weather as well as to comment on the ''weather tendency'' of recent days. But this study also shows the prominent role that advice-giving featured here; in fact, the aforementioned increase in advice during extreme events could be traced to the forecast component. In addition, Beijing Evening News consistently featured more advice in their forecasts.\n\nFinally, uses of imperatives and vocatives were investigated in order to determine how the journalists positioned themselves in relation to their audience. During extreme events, the number of imperatives used by both newspapers increased significantly. This usage pattern suggests that during times where potentially life-saving advice was communicated, the journalists sought to establish themselves as experts, thus further stressing the relevance of the advice in their commentary. For Beijing Evening News, we found a similar pattern for the high-status vocative sh\u00ecm\u00edn, where again the journalists utilised this linguistic device to display authority more during extreme events. Beijing Morning Post, on the other hand, showed a clear preference for the equal-status addressing term p\u00e9ngy\u01d2 u regardless of the type of weather. While appropriate use of high-status addressing terms can increase the feeling of authority or reliability of advice, the use of equal-status addressing term can add credit to the intimate writer-reader relationship. This could, in turn, increase the acceptability of potentially face-threatening advice.\n\nCombining our findings for these addressing terms, we conclude that writers, who were prone to take an authoritative stance when giving advice to their readers, did so to an even greater extent during extreme weather; whereas writers who position themselves ''with'' their readers, used more imperatives but did not change their vocative preferences. Since the purpose behind advice-giving tends to be to urge compliance with the advice, we can assume that the different writers have deliberately chosen to pursue compliance by these different means. It is very possible that the writer's selfpositioning to the putative readers affects the willingness and likelihood to comply with the advice. Future studies should attempt to investigate the extent to which readers' compliance with advice is determined by the use of vocatives and imperatives. "}
