The amide oxygen of the warhead accepts an H-bond from the imidazole of His41 in the complexes with SARS-CoV M pro and HCoV-NL63 M pro , and from the oxyanion-hole amide of Gly145 in CVB3 3C pro , but the P1' benzyl group appears not fully embedded in the pocket (see Fig. 3a -c). We therefore replaced it by n-butyl in 11b (Table S1 ). This resulted in an improvement of the inhibitory activity against CVB3 3C pro (from IC50 = 6.6 to 1.0 \u00b5M), whereas that against the EV-A71 enzyme was somewhat weaker (IC50 = 2.4 \u00b5M). Most importantly, however, the compound proved totally inactive against recombinant SARS-CoV M pro (IC50 > 50 \u00b5M). Replacement of the P1' substituent by tert-butyl in 11c led to very poor activities against all three proteases, and P1' = isobutyl (11d) or 2-methoxy-2-oxoethyl (11e) were not much better. Therefore, although there is probably room for further improvement, we decided to maintain the original design with P1' = benzyl.\n\nInspection of the crystal structures of 11a in complex with SARS-CoV M pro and CVB3 3C pro suggested that the interaction of the P3-cinnamoyl group with the binding cleft might be sub-optimal (Fig. 3a, c) . In order to furnish the P3 group with more flexibility, we reduced the double bond in 11a to generate 11g. However, presumably for entropic reasons, this led to a 2-to 3-fold decrease in activity against the SARS-CoV M pro and the EV-A71 3C pro , compared to compound 11a (Table S1 ). CVB3 3C pro was the only protease against which an improvement by the reduction of the double bond of the cinnamoyl group was noted, but in the replicon assays, compound 11g was inferior to 11a in all cases (Table S2) .\n\nIntroduction in P3 of less flexible, bulky substituents such as 2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxine-6-carbonyl (11h) and 2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxine-5-carbonyl (11i) also met with limited success; IC50 values were mediocre for inhibition of the EV-A71 3C pro and the CVB3 3C pro and higher by a factor of at least 5 for inhibition of the SARS-CoV M pro , compared to compound 11a. P3 = benzofuran-2-carbonyl (11j) led to a further reduction of inhibitory activity, particularly against the EV-A71 3C pro . Compounds with P3 = benzo[b]thiophene-2-carbonyl (11k) and 6-bromoimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-2-carbonyl (11l) were inactive against EV-A71 3C pro and only very moderately active against CVB3 3C pro and SARS-CoV M pro (Table S1 ). Inspection of the template crystal structures revealed that all of these substituents would occupy the space of the main chain of a peptide substrate at the S3 and partly S4 sites and are unable to reach into the space normally taken by a P3 amino-acid side-chain (which would be relatively unrestricted in all three proteases). However, in the predicted main-chain-like orientation, the extended aromatic groups would interfere with the NH group of Leu127 and the carbonyl of Gly164.\n\nIn summary, the cinnamoyl group of the original compound, 11a, was superior to all other substituents explored. Among the compounds tested thus far, 11a resulted in the best inhibitory activities towards both enterovirus 3C pro and SARS-CoV M pro . Accordingly, we decided to retain the cinnamoyl group as the substituent at the P3 position. -4.41 (m, 2H), 4.30 -4.17 (m, 4H), 3.34 -3.24 (m, 2H), 3.16 (ddd, J = 13.8, 8.1, 3.6 Hz, 2H), 2.51 -2.40 (m, 1H), 2.28 -2.12 (m, 1H), 2.08 -1.94 (m, 2H), 1.86 (dd, J = 12.8, 6.1 Hz, 1H).
