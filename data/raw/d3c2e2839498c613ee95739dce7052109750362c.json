The 174 IgG against whole virus was above the cutoff value, and the IgG titers were significantly 175 higher in group 1 than in group 2 (p < 0.001; Figure 3A) . A similar trend was observed for\n\nIgG against N199 titers, as group 1 had significantly higher IgG titers than group 2 (p=0.034; 177 Figure 3B ). Moreover, in group 1 the positive rate of IgG binding to whole virus and N199 178 was 58.70% and 28.26% with statiscical significance (p < 0.005), respectively.\n\nKappa test was used to estimate the consistency between the methods for testing IgG.

The cohort was divided into two groups to assess the effect of antigen was used to detect its specific antibody, which has been demonstrated to be specific in 226 clinical diagnosis and SARS-CoV reservoir screening. 21 We therefore adopted the testing of 227 IgG against N199, combined with the titer analysis of IgG against the whole virus, to 228 comprehensively evaluate the SARS antibody duration.\n\n.

However, no differences were found between the two 233 groups after 2003, suggesting that corticosteroids may suppress the early production of 234 SARS-CoV IgG antibodies.\n\nIn our cohort, we found that two healthcare workers might have been misdiagnosed with 236 SARS, as the IgG antibodies against both the whole virus and N199 antigen was persistently 237 lower than the cutoff value, for these two patients.
