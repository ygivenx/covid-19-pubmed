{"title": "Development of a porcine epidemic diarrhea virus M protein-based ELISA for virus detection", "body": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is contagious, enteric disease. The major clinical signs of PED include vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration. The mortality in infected neonatal piglets less than 5 days old may reach 100% (Kim and Chae 2000) . The causative agent of PED is porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus. PEDV was first recognized in Europe in 1977 (Pensaert and Debouck 1978) . Several outbreaks of PED have been reported mostly in Europe and East Asia (Pensaert and Sang-Geon 2006) .\n\nCoronaviruses, including PEDV, are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses and contain four major structural proteins: spike (S) (180-220 kDa), envelope (E), membrane (M) (27-32 kDa) and nucleocapsid (N) (55-58 kDa) (Murphy et al. 1999; Ren et al. 2008 ). The M protein plays an important role in the assembly process of viral nucleocapsid and membrane. The M glycoprotein can neutralize anti-M antibody in the present of complement and stimulate the production of interferon (Laude et al. 1992) . The M protein is abundant among the structural proteins of PEDV. In addition, the nucleotide sequence of the M gene possess low homology (approx. 50%) with other coronaviruses, but is highly conserved among different PEDV strains (Kim and Chae 2000) . Therefore, the M protein may be used as a candidate diagnostic reagent for determining PEDV infection.\n\nIn this study, we have expressed the M gene of PEDV and generated an anti-M polyclonal antibody via animal inoculation. Analysis on the activities of the M protein and the antibody indicated that both proteins were biologically active. The antibody was able to discriminate PEDV from other viruses selected.\n\nConstruction of expression plasmid, pET-PEDV-M A recombinant plasmid pEasy T-M containing the full-length M gene of PEDV was used as a template to amplify a signal peptide sequence-deleted M gene using a sense primer: 5 0 -GGGCGAATTCATGAC TCTTGAAATTTCATGTTAT-3 0 and a reverse primer: 5 0 -CCGGGTCGACTTTTATAACAGCTGTGG CATCTAA-3 0 . Both primers contained EcoRI and XhoI sites (underline parts), respectively. The PCR parameters included 95\u00b0C for 5 min, 30 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 55.6\u00b0C for 1 min, 72\u00b0C for 1 min and a final extension of 72\u00b0C for 8 min. The PCR product was cloned into the same sites of a prokaryotic expression vector, pET-30a (Novagen, USA), resulting a recombinant plasmid pET-PEDV-M. The DNA plasmid was purified using a purification kit (KeyGen Biotech, China) prior to DNA sequencing.\n\nThe pET-PEDV-M was transformed into host cells [E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS] and the protein expression was analyzed according to a recent reference with modifications (Liu et al. 2009 ). Briefly, the bacteria harboring the pET-PEDV-M were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37\u00b0C with shaking until the OD 600 reached 0.5. Then, IPTG was added to 0.5 or 1 mM to induce protein expression at 37 or 30\u00b0C for 6 h. Empty vector-transformed bacteria were used as control. Expression amount of the M protein in the total bacterial protein was analyzed using software. The bacterial suspension (20 ml) was centrifuged; the cells were re-suspended in TE buffer (50 mM Tris/ HCl and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), mixed with lysozyme (100 lg/l) at room temperature for 30 min, then was sonicated on ice for 30 min and finally centrifuged at 10,0009g for 20 min. The supernatant and pellets were mixed with SDS-loading buffer, subjected to 12% (v/v) SDS-PAGE and the gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. The gel purification and re-naturation of fusion protein by dialysis were performed according to Liu et al. (2009) . The protein of interest was designated as PEDV-M.\n\nPreparation and titration of anti-M protein polyclonal antibody\n\nTo generate a specific polyclonal antibody against the PEDV-M protein, two New Zealand rabbits were immunized with the purified PEDV-M protein (2 mg/ml) emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant via subcutaneous injection (1 ml/each rabbit). Two weeks later, the rabbits were injected with the same antigen (0.5 ml) mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Subsequent injections were made every week for 10 weeks. Blood of the immunized rabbits was collected from neck artery and the anti-M antibody was isolated. The antibody titer was determined using ELISA. Briefly, ELISA plates were coated with the PEDV-M protein (1 lg/well) at 4\u00b0C and held overnight in 50 mM Na 2 CO 3 /NaHCO 3 buffer, pH 8.6. The next day, the wells were blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk in PBS/0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) at 37\u00b0C for 2 h, after washing three times with PBST. Then the wells were incubated with serially diluted polyclonal antibody at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Serum from a non-immunized rabbit was used as control. The wells were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000 diluted in PBS) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h followed by addition of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) for 10 min. The reaction was stopped using 2 M H 2 SO 4 and the A 450 value was read using an ELISA plate reader.\n\nWestern blot E. coli expressing either the PEDV-M protein or empty vector was induced by IPTG and the lysates were subjected to 12% (v/v) SDS-PAGE. The proteins were electronically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane which was blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C using 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk in PBST buffer and then incubated with anti-M polyclonal antibody (1:400 dilution in PBST) at room temperature for 2 h. After the membrane was washed three times with PBST, they were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2,000 dilution in PBST) for another 1 h. The protein bands were visualized using OPD.\n\nAfrican green monkey kidney cell line, Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 37\u00b0C. The next day, the cells were infected with PEDV isolate HLJBY at 37\u00b0C for 48-72 h. Immunofluorescence assays were performed (see Ren et al. 2006; Sui et al. 2010 ) with modifications. Briefly, the cells were fixed 4% (w/v) formalin in PBS for 20 min and then were quenched with 0.1 M glycine in PBS. Then they were incubated with the anti-M antibody at 1:100 in 1% BSA at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma), 1:200 diluted in 1% BSA for another 1 h in the dark. After washing three times with PBS, the fluorescence was observed under a fluorescence microscope.\n\nELISA ELISA plates were coated with a panel of viruses (see Fig. 5 ). The coating concentration was 2 lg per well at 4\u00b0C overnight. The next day, the wells were blocked with 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk-PBST at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. The anti-PEDV-M protein antibody (1:100 diluted in PBST) was added into the wells at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. After rinsing three times with PBST, the wells were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1,000 diluted in PBST) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. OPD was added and incubated for 15 min after washing with PBST. The A 450 was read using an ELISA plate reader.\n\nThe signal peptide sequence-deleted PEDV-M gene was amplified using PCR and then cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector. The authenticity of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The cloned gene was identical to the reported M gene sequence of PEDV strain CV777 (GenBank accession number: AF353511). SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that expression of PEDV-M protein was detectable at 1 h post-IPTG induction (Fig. 1a) . The protein was expressed as inclusion body in recombinant E. coli and its molecular weight was approx. 27 kDa as expected (Fig. 1b) . The optimal induction condition for PEDV-M protein expression was 0.5 mM IPTG at 37\u00b0C. The expressed M protein was then purified (see Fig. 2 ).\n\nThe purified M protein was used to immune rabbits for generating a polyclonal antibody. The antibody titer was 1:10 12 . To analyze the recognizing ability of the anti-PEDV-M antibody to the M protein, the antibody was used as primary antibody in a conventional Western blot. The polyclonal antibody reacted with the M protein (Fig. 3) . The biological activity of the antibody was further analyzed using an immunofluorescence assay. Green fluorescence was detected in the PEDV-infected cells (Fig. 4) .\n\nTo investigate the utility of the antibody further, various viruses were used as coating antigens in indirect ELISA. Our results indicated that the anti-M antibody reacted with PEDV exclusively and no cross-reaction between the antibody and other viruses was detected (Fig. 5 ).\n\nThe first Chinese PEDV was isolated in 1980. Since then more PEDV infections have been reported in different areas and PED has been a serious threat to the pig industry in China. Effective diagnostic methods are required for surveillance of PED. The first purpose of the current study was to express PEDV-M gene. The expression of coronavirus M protein is difficult due to its sprout function. The viral M protein may cause damage to cell wall resulting in the growth inhibition (Kopecky and Lyles 2003) . PEDV-M protein has been expressed in eukaryotic cells and a baculovirus system (Utiger et al. 1995) . However, low expression and high costs may affect the application of the expressed protein. In contrast, the prokaryotic system is a time-and cost-efficient system for high-level protein production. Selection of a suitable prokaryotic system is important for foreign gene expression (Yin et al. 2007) . We have already expressed several heterologous proteins, including glycoproteins, in prokaryotic systems and the bacterially-expressed proteins display excellent biological activities (Liu et al. 2009; Ren et al. 2010a, b) .\n\nHigh-level prokaryotic expression of envelope exterior of PEDV-M protein has been reported (Shenyang et al. 2007) . In this study, we expressed full-length PEDV-M gene using a similar expression system. Availability of the mature M protein may allow us to identify more antigenic epitopes in this protein and make more functional analysis in the future. The M protein of PEDV has been identified by use of rabbit anti-peptide sera and transient expression of the M gene in Vero cells and by expression in the baculovirus system. The native M protein of PEDV is incorporated into virions, is N-glycosylated and with a molecular size of 27 kDa. In contrast, the (Utiger et al. 1995) . In this study, the bacterially-expressed M protein is excluded from glycosylation and also migrates with an Mr of approx. 23 kDa (excluding the His-tag in the N-terminus). However, amount of the protein is enough for functional analysis and related experiments. The M protein was inoculated into rabbits to generate antibody. At different immunization intervals, we found that the titer of the anti-M antibody increased slowly, therefore, we had to prolong the immunization period (up to 3 months) to achieve a higher antibody titer. In our study, the sera collected from two immunized rabbits gave the similar antibody titer. Western blot and immunofluorescence assays showed that the antibody recognized the M protein and the virus-infected cells, indicating that the polyclonal antibody can be used for detection of PEDV.\n\nEnteric infection caused by PEDV should be differentiated from other enteric viral diseases such as TGEV, a counterpart of the same group in the family Coronaviridae. They caused similar clinical signs and histological intestinal lesions, such as severe villus atrophy in the proximal and distal jejunum as well as in the ileum (Kim and Chae 2000) . Herein porcine coronaviruses (TGEV and PEDV), avian coronavirus (IBV), porcine arterivirus (PRRSV), porcine pestivirus (CSFV) and porcine herpesvirus (PrV) were used as coating antigens in an indirect ELISA. The viruses have been confirmed by ELISA or PCR (data not shown). The results showed that the anti-M polyclonal antibody was specific to PEDV. These selected viruses are common pathogens in China and some of which may cause mixed infection with PEDV. The established ELISA described in this paper is valuable for differentiating infection between PEDV and other related viruses."}
