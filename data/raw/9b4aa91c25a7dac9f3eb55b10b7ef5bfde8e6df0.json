{"title": "On fractional order differential equations model for nonlocal epidemics", "body": "Recently three major epidemic diseases have occurred namely foot-and-mouth disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian (bird's) flu. Hopefully this will increase the awareness of modeling infectious diseases spreading that is an important topic in mathematical biology [1] . There are different approaches to this topic, e.g. ordinary differential equations, difference equations, partial differential equations and coupled map lattice. Here we use fractional order differential equations (FOD). The reason is that FOD are naturally related to systems with memory which exists in most biological systems. Also they are closely related to fractals which are abundant in biological systems. Consider the following evolution equation [2] :\n\nk\u00f0t \u00c0 t 0 \u00def \u00f0t 0 \u00de dt 0 .\n\nIf the system has no memory then k(t\u00c0t 0 ) \u00bc d(t\u00c0t 0 ), and one gets f(t) \u00bc f 0 exp(\u00c0l 2 t). If the system has an ideal memory, then \n\nwhere G(a) is the Gamma function. This system has the following solution:\n\nwhere E a (z) is the Mittag-Leffler function given by\n\nFollowing a similar procedure to study a random process with memory, one obtains the following fractional evolution equation:\n\nwhere P(x, t) is a measure of the probability to find a particle at time t at position x. We expect that the above result will be relevant to many complex adaptive systems and to systems where fractal structures are relevant since it is argued that there is a strong relevance between fractals and fractional differentiation [3] . For the case of fractional diffusion equation the results are q a\u00fe1 P\u00f0x; t\u00de qt a\u00fe1 \u00bc D q 2 P\u00f0x; t\u00de qx 2 ; P\u00f0x; 0\u00de \u00bc d\u00f0x\u00de;\n\n\u00f0\u00c01\u00de n z n n!G\u00f0\u00c0bn \u00fe 1 \u00c0 b\u00de .\n\nFor the case of no memory a \u00bc 0 ) M(z; 1/2) \u00bc exp(\u00c0z 2 /4). The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we study the stability of FOD. The stability conditions are derived and several examples are given. The stability conditions for some fractional order differential coupled map lattices are concluded in Section 3. Applications to nonlocal epidemics is introduced in Section 4. The stability conditions for the disease-free state are discussed. Some conclusions are presented in Section 5.\n\n2. Stability of fractional order differential equations [4] [5] [6] Consider the following system: \n\nwhere the fractional derivative in Eq. (1) is in the sense of Caputo. The equilibrium solutions are defined by f(x eq , y eq ) \u00bc 0, g(x eq , y eq ) \u00bc 0 and it is locally asymptotically stable if all the eigenvalues l of the Jacobian\n\n\" # evaluated at the equilibrium point satisfies the following condition [4, 5] :\n\n(2)\n\nThe condition in Eq. (2) poses an interesting question namely: What are the conditions that all the roots of the polynomial equation\n\nsatisfy Eq. (2) where all the coefficients in Eq. (3) are real? For a \u00bc 1, the solution is the Routh-Hurwitz conditions [7] a 1 40; a 1 1 a 3 a 2 40;\n\nFor aA[0, 1), these conditions are sufficient but not necessary. Since most biologically interesting systems are 1,2 and 3-dimensions, we will study the problem (3) for n \u00bc 1, 2, 3.\n\nis the determinant of the corresponding Sylvester (n+l)(n+l) matrix. The Sylvester matrix is formed by filling the matrix beginning with the upper left corner with the coefficients of f (x), then shifting down one row and one column to the right and filling in the coefficients starting there until they hit the right side. The process is then repeated for the coefficients of g (x).\n\nUsing the results of Ref. [3] , if D( f )40(o0) then there is an even (odd) number of pairs of complex roots for the equation f(x) \u00bc 0. For n \u00bc 3, this implies that D (f)40, and all the roots are real while D (f)o0 implies that there is only one real root and one complex root and its complex conjugate. For n \u00bc 3, we have\n\nProposition 1.\n\n(i) For n \u00bc 1, the condition for (3) is a 1 40.\n\n(ii) For n \u00bc 2, the conditions for (3) are either Routh-Hurwitz conditions or (viii) For n41, the necessary and sufficient condition for (3) is\n\nProof. Case (i) is obvious. For (ii), the two roots are l AE \u00bc \u00c0a 1 AE ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi\n\nIf both roots are real or complex conjugates with negative real parts then condition (3) is equivalent to the Routh-Hurwitz case. If the two roots are complex conjugate with positive real parts, then the two roots become l AE \u00bc \u00c0a 1 AE i ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi ffi 4a 2 \u00c0 \u00f0a 1 \u00de 2 q =2 and one gets Eq. (5).\n\nTo prove (iii) not that if n \u00bc 3, D (p)40, then all the roots of p(l) \u00bc 0 are real hence Routh-Hurwitz conditions are both necessary and sufficient for (3).\n\nTo prove (iv) not that if n \u00bc 3, D (P)40, then the roots of P(l) \u00bc 0 are one real and a complex conjugate pair thus\n\nand a 1 40 ) b42b, a 2 40 ) b 2 sec 2 y42bb44b 2 ) y4p/3, where y \u00bc |arg(l)|. The second part is proved similarly.\n\nTo prove (v) if n \u00bc 3, D(P)40, then Eq. (7) is\n\nThe last equality is not valid if both a 1 40, a 2 40.\n\nTo prove (vi) use the fact that for general n\n\nTo prove (vii) use Eq. (8) and P(l) \u00bc P(\u00c0l)8l ) P(l) contains only even power of\n\nAnd all the roots x should be negative.\n\nTo prove (viii) not that if P(z) has no roots in the region |arg(l)|oap/2, hence the function 1/P(z) will be analytic in this region. Using Cauchy theorem H C f \u00f0z\u00de dz \u00bc 0 for all f(z) analytic within and on the curve C, and that P(z) is polynomial of degree 41 this completes the proof. & One can give explicit examples where the Routh-Hurwitz conditions are not valid yet Eq. (3) is satisfied for explicit a, e.g. a \u00bc 1 2 . The first example is\n\nFor n \u00bc 3, one can solve the polynomial equation explicitly and apply Eq. (3) to the solutions. The solution method is:\n\nDefine y \u00bc l\u00c0a 1 /2, then the polynomial becomes\n\nchoose the roots such that rs \u00bc \u00c0p/3. For all n43, if D 1 ; D 2 ; . . . ; D n are Routh-Hurwitz determinants\n\n. . . , then the conditions\n\n. . . ; n \u00c0 2; a n 40; D n\u00c01 \u00bc 0, (9) are sufficient conditions that Eq. (3) is valid for all aA[0, 1).\n\nThis conjecture can be proved for n \u00bc 4. The case n \u00bc 3 is proved in Proposition 1. Now we apply Proposition 1 to derive the value of a at which chaos or instability disappears at some models. Fractional order Lotka-Volterra (FLV) predator-rey model is given by\n\nwhere b, g are positive constants. The equilibrium solutions of FLV are (0, 0) and (g, b) . The eigenvalues corresponding to (0, 0) are b, \u00c0g respectively hence (0, 0) is unstable for all aA[0, 1]. The eigenvalues corresponding to (g, b) are AEi ffiffiffiffiffi bg p hence |arg(l)| \u00bc p/2, then it is locally asymptotically stable for all aA[0, 1). This agrees with the numerical results of Ref.

The eigenvalues of the internal equilibrium solution is l 3 +(a\u00c0c+b)l 2 +bcl+2ab(2c\u00c0a) \u00bc 0. Since all the coefficients of this polynomial are positive and it is easy to check that D(P)o0, using Proposition 1 part (iv) then the internal solution of FOC will be stable for ao 2 3 which is in excellent agreement with the numerical result obtained by and Chen [8] .\n\nA similar result is obtained for fractional order Lorenz system\n\nwhere r, b, c are positive constants and r41. The fractional order Rossler system (FOR) is defined by [9] D a x \u00bc \u00c0\u00f0y \u00fe z\u00de; D a y \u00bc x \u00fe ay; D a z \u00bc 0:2 \u00fe xz \u00c0 10z; a \u00bc 0:6 There are one equilibrium z \u00bc \u00c0y, x \u00bc \u00c0ay, y \u00bc \u00bd\u00c010 \u00fe ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 100 \u00c0 0:8a p =2a, and the characteristic polynomial is l 3 \u00fe \u00f0ay \u00c0 a \u00fe 10\u00del 2 \u00fe \u00f01 \u00c0 ya 2 \u00c0 10a \u00c0 y\u00del \u00fe 10 \u00fe 2ay \u00bc 0.\n\nIt is direct to see that a 2 o0, a 1 40 hence by solving the characteristic equation directly one gets the following roots: l \u00bc \u00c09:986; l \u00bc 0:3 \u00c0 0:954i; l \u00bc 0:3 \u00fe 0:954i.\n\nThis implies that the equilibrium solution is locally asymptotically stable if ao0.8 which is in excellent agreement with the result obtained numerically in Ref.

Stability conditions for some fractional order differential coupled map lattices Spatial effects are important in many biological systems. Thus generalizing fractional order systems (FOS) to include them is important. The standard approach is fractional order partial differential equations. However since most biologically interesting systems are nonlinear [10] , one gets fractional order nonlinear partial differential equations whose existence and uniqueness has not been established yet. Therefore, we use coupled map lattices (CML) [11] as an alternative approach to include spatial effects in FOS. Consider the 1-system CML\n\nwhere D is a positive constant. The homogeneous equilibrium solution of Eq. (10) satisfies f(u eq ) \u00bc 0 and it is stable if all the eigenvalues of the circulant matrix [12] \u00f01 \u00c0 D\u00def 0 \u00f0D=2\u00def 0 0 . . . satisfies Eq. (2). Since the eigenvalues of the circulant matrices [12] are known, the local asymptotic stability conditions become arg \u00f01 \u00c0 D\u00def 0 \u00f0u eq \u00de \u00fe Df 0 \u00f0u eq \u00de cos 2pk n 4 ap 2 , k \u00bc 0; 1; . . . ; n \u00c0 1 \u00f011\u00de\n\nFor n \u00bc 3, the characteristic polynomial of A is\n\nwhere a 1 \u00bc \u00c0\u00bdl 1 \u00c0 g 1 \u00fe l 2 \u00c0 g 2 \u00fe l 3 \u00c0 g 3 , a 2 \u00bc \u00f0l 1 \u00c0 g 1 \u00de\u00f0l 2 \u00c0 g 2 \u00de \u00c0 m 1 m 2 \u00fe \u00f0l 1 \u00c0 g 1 \u00de\u00f0l 3 \u00c0 g 3 \u00de \u00c0 m 1 m 3 \u00fe \u00f0l 3 \u00c0 g 3 \u00de\u00f0l 2 \u00c0 g 2 \u00de \u00c0 m 3 m 2 and a 3 \u00bc \u00c0\u00bd\u00f0l 1 \u00c0 g 1 \u00de\u00f0l 2 \u00c0 g 2 \u00de\u00f0l 3 \u00c0 g 3 \u00de \u00fe 2m 1 m 2 m 3 \u00c0 \u00f0l 1 \u00c0 g 1 \u00dem 2 m 3 \u00c0 \u00f0l 3 \u00c0 g 3 \u00dem 2 m 1 \u00c0 \u00f0l 2 \u00c0 g 2 \u00dem 1 m 3 .\n\nUsing part (vi) in Proposition 1, the disease free state is unstable if a 3 o0.\n\nFinally vaccination may affect the parameters l i but not m i . Also it is important to know whether the vaccine works once administered or it takes time till it becomes effective.\n\nA fractional order evolution equation describing a random process with memory is concluded. This will be relevant to many complex adaptive systems. The stability conditions for both fractional order differential equations and fractional order differential coupled map lattices are derived. A fractional order form of Lajmanovich-Yorke model is introduced. This model emphasis the nonlocal interaction beside the local interaction in the epidemic spreading. Both types of interaction are widely observed in the recent FMD, SARS and bird's flu outbreaks."}
