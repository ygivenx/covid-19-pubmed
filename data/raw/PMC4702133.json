{"title": "The recent ancestry of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in Korea has been shaped by recombination", "body": "In this study, we investigated a total of 70 complete genome sequences of human MERS-CoV strains that were downloaded from the database of National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/VirusVariation/Database/nph-select2.cgi). Detailed information of isolation and genomic sequencing of a Korean MERS-CoV strain was published previously28. Briefly, a sputum sample was collected in May 20, 2015 from the wife of the index case, who travelled to four Middle East countries including the United Arab Emirates and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for 16 days before the onset of his symptom in May 11, 2015. After the third passage in Vero cells, viral RNA was obtained from cell culture media (QIAamp viral RNA mini kit: QIAGEN, Germany) and used for reverse-transcription PCR (Superscript III first-strand synthesis system: Life Technologies, the Netherlands)29. The pooled PCR amplicons were then fragmented (~ 300 bp in length) and used for the sequence library construction using an Illumina TruSeq Nano DNA sample prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). After sequencing the library using an Illumina MiSeq 50-bp single-end platform (Illumina), more than 2.6 million sequence reads out of 2,814,805 reads (approximately 93% usage) were mapped to the consensus of human-origin MERS-CoV genome sequences downloaded from GenBank using Bowtie version 2.2.430. The complete genome sequence was obtained based on an average coverage of 3,605.95 and submitted to the NCBI database (accession number KT029139, MERS-CoV/KOR/KNIH/002_05_2015)28. The first Chinese strain of MERS-CoV (NCBI accession number KT006149, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus strain ChinaGD01) appeared to be imported from a Korean traveler who visited to Guangdong Province and was sequenced directly from a nasopharyngeal sample (collected in May 27, 2015) using a NGS method31. The two most recent Saudi Arabian sequences in 2015 appeared to be obtained after passages in Vero cells of a tracheal aspirate (NCBI accession number KT026455, Hu/Riyadh_KSA_2959_2015)32 and a respiratory swab (NCBI accession number KT026456, Hu/Riyadh_KSA_4050_2015)33 samples using the NGS method. After alignment using the MAFFT program (v7.130b)34, the datasets of complete genome and 10 protein coding regions were established by extracting corresponding sequence regions. The stop codon in the C-terminal region was removed. The resulting MERS-CoV datasets were assigned to complete genome (29,529 nucleotides, nts), ORF1ab (21,234 nts)), S (4,059 nts), ORF3 (309 nts), ORF4a (327 nts), ORF4b (738 nts), ORF5 (672 nts), E (246 nts), M (657 nts), N (1,239 nts), and ORF8b (336 nts). To compare phylogenetic clustering patterns, we also set up another dataset for the regions S through N coding regions (S-N region; 8,352 nts).\n\nPhylogenetic relationships, evolutionary rates (nucleotide substitutions/site/year), and the time (year) of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) were estimated using a time-framed Bayesian evolution analysis approach via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference method, implemented in the BEAST package (v1.8.2)19. We used the GTR+I+\u0393 substitution model, a lognormal relaxed molecular clock model and a Bayesian skygrid tree prior. For the of ORF4a, ORF4b, and ORF5 datasets, we used the HKY+\u0393 substitution model and a strict clock model. The evolutionary parameters (only for substitution and molecular clock parameters, not the tree model) were linked for the dataset of E coding region by adjoining those of the complete genome sequences. MCMC analyses were run for 50 million iterations, sampling every 25 thousand iterations after a 10% burn-in. Two or three independent runs for each dataset were combined and assessed to ensure their convergence in Tracer (v1.6)35. The MCMC tree samples were used to summarize a maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees for each dataset using TreeAnnotator v1.8.1, which were visualized using FigTree (v1.4.2). The estimates were presented as mean values along with the lower and upper limits of the 95% highest probability density (HPD).\n\nTo detect putative recombinant regions in the MERS-CoV genome, we used the RDP4 program (v.4.39)36 with a default (window size: 30 bp) and a higher window size of 1,000 bp, and the results obtained were confirmed by a manual bootscan method. Using the recombination breakpoints detected in the KOR002 strain by the default setting, we compiled new sequence datasets by dividing the complete genome sequences into five non-recombinant fragments. We subsequently reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships in each region using a maximum likelihood method (GTR+I+\u0393, 500 bootstrap replication) implemented in MEGA537. The trees were visualized using FigTree (v1.4.2).\n\nHow to cite this article: Kim, J. I. et al.
