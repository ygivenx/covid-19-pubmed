Phosphorylation of IRF3, efficacy of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 inhibitor in bat cells, details on computational analysis and validation of IRF3 KO THF cells, Related to Figures  1 and 3 , and STAR METHODS. (A) Determination of IRF3-S396 phosphorylation using a cross-reactive human pIRF3-S396 antibody. Efk3B cells were treated with 100 ng of poly(I:C) and cell lysates were harvested at multiple time points. Efk3B cells were also infected with Sendai virus for 6 h and cell lysates were harvested for immunoblots. Immunoblots for the 396 th phospho-serine residue in IRF3 (pIRF3-S396), IRF3 and GAPDH are shown. Lanes 2-5 were removed from this blot. The deletion between the ladder and lanes 6-10 is indicated by a space.\n\n(B) Efk3B cells were mock treated or treated with increasing concentrations of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 inhibitor (Amlexanox), and mock stimulated or stimulated with 100 ng of poly(I:C). Cell lysates were harvested for immunoblots. Immunoblots for pIRF3-S396, IRF3 and GAPDH are shown. Lanes 2-4 were removed from this blot. The deletion between the ladder and lanes 5-9 is indicated by a space.\n\n(C) PakiT03 cells were mock treated or treated with increasing concentrations of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 inhibitor (Amlexanox), and mock stimulated or stimulated with 100 ng of poly(I:C). Cell lysates were harvested for immunoblots. Immunoblots for pIRF3-S396, IRF3 and GAPDH are shown. Lanes 2-4 were removed from this blot. The deletion between the ladder and lanes 5-9 is indicated by a space.\n\n(D) Related to STAR Methods. Validation of IRF3 and IFNAR1 knockout in THF-IRF3-IFNAR1 double knockout (dKO) cells. IRF3, ISG56 and GAPDH protein expression were detected by immunoblots in mock-treated cells or cells treated with human leukocyte interferon for 1 hour. THF WT and THF-IFNAR1 KO cells were used as positive and negative controls, respectively for IFN-induced ISG56 expression. Different portions of the gels are represented here, separated by spaces. The blots were developed using chemiluminescent technology (see methods). Approximate sizes of the proteins are indicated.\n\n(E) Related to Figure 1. Using the Python ETE3 package, the aligned sequences were tested for positive selection using PAML models. The results for IRF3 are shown. Model M1 was tested against M2. These models differ, with the later having an extra parameter with omega (w) greater than zero (indicating positive selection). The significantly increased likelihood indicates that a model with positive selection fits better (left panel). Model M7 was tested against M8. These models have categories that follow a beta distribution, while M8 allows for positive selection. The significantly increased likelihood indicates positive selection fits better. Since the likelihood ratios were significant (left panel), posterior probabilities were used to identify sites under positive selection. The differences, M7/M8, via Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis (Yang et al., 2005) identified positively selected sites that are shown in the right panel. The sites are numbered according to Bos taurus IRF3 sequence. The Serine (S) residue at position 234 (234 S) corresponds to site 185 in Figure 1 and has an omega value significantly >1. Ef, Eptesicus fuscus; Pa, Pteropus alecto; pIRF3, phospho-IRF3; WT, wildtype; IFNAR, interferon a/b receptor; dKO, double knockout; IRF3, interferon regulatory factor 3, GAPDH, Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ISG56, Interferon-stimulated gene 56. \n\nDr. Karen Mossman (mossk@mcmaster.ca) and Dr. Lin-Fa Wang (linfa.wang@dukenus.edu.sg).\n\nThe longest IRF3 isoform for each of eleven bat species was selected from the NCBI nucleotide database . A group of diverse species of mammals were selected to serve as outgroups. These included primates (Homo sapiens, Macaca mulatta, Macaca fascicularis and Pongo abelli), rodents (Mus musculus, and Cricetulus griseus), Equus ferus, Bos taurus and Sus scrofa. The alignments were carried out using MAFFT (version 7 with the G-INS-i (globalpair -maxiterate 1000) option) (Katoh et al., 2002) . The alignment was manually checked using NCBI's multiple sequence alignment (MSA) viewer and checked to ensure that all codons were correctly aligned. RAxML HPC (version 8.2) was used to generate phylogenetic trees using amino acid sequences (Stamatakis, 2014) . Phylogenetic trees were generated using the WAG matrix (GAMMA model).\n\nFor each tree, 1000 bootstraps were generated. A majority consensus (>50%) tree was then calculated from the bootstrap trees. PAML CodeML v4.5 was automated by ETE3 package under Python 2.7 environment (Yang, 2007 , Yang, 1997 . Branch lengths were calculated by CodeML. Site selection models (M1a, M2a, M7, M8) and branch-site model as specified by CodeML were tested. For the branch-site model, each branch, which consists of a single species was tested for positive selection. A likelihood ratio test was used to test the difference between the alternate and null hypothesis. M1 is the nearly neutral model, and was the null hypothesis that was tested against M2, which incorporates positive selection. Model M7 incorporates a beta distributed selection values while M8 adds a class of sites with positive selection. Model M8 was tested against the null hypothesis M7. Since the likelihood ratios were significant (see supplementary figure S1E ; left panel), posterior probabilities were used to identify sites under positive selection. The differences, M7/M8, via Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis (Yang et al., 2005) identified positively selected residues (see supplementary figure S1E ; right panel).\n\nViruses and Cell lines THF, THF-IRF3 knockout (KO), THF-IFNAR1 KO, THF-IRF3-IFNAR1 double-KO (dKO) human fibroblast cells and HEK 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Sigma) supplemented with L-Glutamine (Sigma), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma) and penicillin/streptomycin (ThermoFisher Scientific). Efk3B (wildtype cells) and cr3-8 (E. fuscus IRF3KO kidney) cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with GlutaMax (Gibco), 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. PakiT03, PakiT03-4G (IRF3 KO), PakiT03-IFNAR2-4A and PakiT03-IFNAR2-IRF3-G6 dKO cells (P. alecto kidney cells) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with GlutaMax (Gibco), 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in humidified, 5% CO2 incubators. Cell lines were periodically tested for mycoplasma contamination. Stocks of genetically engineered vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-GFP) carrying a GFP expression cassette (Noyce et al., 2011) were stored at -80\u00b0C. Virus stocks were thawed once and used for an experiment. A fresh vial was used for each experiment to avoid repeated freeze-thaws. Table S1 for gRNA sequence). 6 h post transfection, the transfection mixture was replaced with complete media containing 1% BSA. 60 h post transfection, the supernatant was harvested and virus was concentrated by ultracentrifugation. THF-IRF3 KO cells were infected with the lentivirus in complete media containing 0.1% polybrene. The following day, cells were passaged and seeded in 10 cm dishes in complete media containing hygromycin. 10 days later, single cell clones were selected and cultured over time. To characterize THF-IRF3-IFNAR1 dKO cells, we were unable to validate the knockout of IFNAR1 by immunoblots since commercially available antibodies did not crossreact with human IFNAR1. To overcome this limitation, we performed immunoblots to demonstrate the loss of IFNAR1-mediated downstream IFNa signalling and ISG56 expression in these cells (see supplementary figure S1D ). Briefly, THF-WT, THF-IFNAR1 KO and THF-IRF3-IFNAR1 dKO cells were treated with interferon from human leukocytes (Sigma) for 1 h and cell lysates were harvested for immunoblots. 25 \u00b5g of total protein per sample was analyzed by immunoblot for ISG56 and IRF3 protein expression. THF IRF3-IFNAR1 dKO clone 2D8 was used for subsequent studies.\n\nFor PakiT03-4G (IRF3KO) and PakiT03-IFNAR2-IRF3-G6 dKO cells, guide RNA design, vector construction, transfection, single cell screening and validation were done as previously described . Parental P. alecto kidney cells (PakiT03) were used to generate IRF3 knockout cells (PakiT03-4G) . Similarly, previously published P. alecto IFNAR2 knockout (PakiT03-IFNAR2-4A) cells were used to generate IFNAR2 and IRF3 double knockout cells (PakiT03-IFNAR2-IRF3-G6 dKO). To generate guide RNA targeting IRF3, exon sequence of IRF3 was submitted to an online software (http://tools.genomeengineering.org) to obtain potential gRNA targets (see Table S1 for gRNA sequences). The top hits were further subjected to BLAST (NCBI) analysis against P.alecto genome to exclude offtarget effects. Two gRNA sequences with high score and specificity were chosen for plasmid construction. The pSpCas9 (BB)-2A-GFP plasmid was used as a vector as previously published (Ran et al., 2013) . P. alecto immortalized kidney (PaKiT03) cell lines (Crameri et al., 2009) were seeded in 6-well plates at a concentration of 8\u00d710 5 cells/well and transfected with 1.5 \u03bcg of plasmid using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as per manufacturer's recommendation. Two days after transfection, cells were sorted using FACSAria III (BD Biosciences). GFP-positive clones were collected and seeded in 96-well plates at a concentration of approximately 2 cells/well. One week later, single colonies of cells were selected for further validation using fluorescent capillary gel electrophoresis. Briefly, genomic DNA from clonal cell populations was extracted using QuickExtract solution (Epicentre) and genetic modifications were verified by PCR, followed by sequencing as previously described ) (see Table S1 ). In addition, THF-IRF3-KO and THF-IRF3-IFNAR1 dKO cells were validated using functional assays as part of this study ( Figures 2D and 4A) . Similarly, PakiT03-4G and PakiT03-IFNAR2-IRF3-G6 dKO cells were also validated by immunoblots and functional assays as part of this study ( Figures 2C, 4C and 4D ).\n\nPlasmid construction RNA was extracted from wildtype THF (human fibroblast), Efk3B (E. fuscus kidney cells) and PakiT03 (P. alecto kidney cells) cells using the RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). cDNA was prepared from 500 ng of RNA using iScript gDNA clear cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). IRF3 coding sequences were amplified using a high-fidelity Q5 DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs) and species-specific primers with restriction sites (see Table S1 for primers). IRF3 amplicons were cloned into pcDNA3.1 (ThermoFisher Scientific) expression plasmid using restriction digestion (New England Biolabs), followed by ligation with T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen). Restriction enzymes NheI and EcoRI (New England Biolabs) were used to digest E. fuscus IRF3 amplicon. NheI and XhoI (New England Biolabs) were used to digest human and P. alecto IRF3 amplicons. All plasmid constructs were confirmed by sequencing (Mobix).\n\nSite-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent). Wang and Malcolm's modification of the manufacturer's protocol was used for this assay (Wang W, 1999) . See Table S1 for primer information. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing (Mobix).\n\nIRF3 expression plasmids and poly(I:C) were transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent as per manufacturer's recommendation (Invitrogen). Varying concentrations of IRF3 expression plasmids or 200 ng of empty (pcDNA 3.1) control plasmid were transfected for 24 hrs. After 24 hrs, media on the cells was replaced with fresh growth media and cells were either mock transfected or transfected with poly(I:C) for 6 hrs. 10 ng poly(I:C) was used for E. fuscus (cr3-8) and human (THF and all CRISPR/clonal derivatives) cell lines. After optimizing poly(I:C)mediated antiviral responses in P. alecto cells (PakiT03 and all CRISPR/clonal derivatives), an optimal concentration of 100 ng was used for all studies in cells from this bat.\n\nVirus infection and quantification 2 x 10 5 cells/well were seeded in 12-well plates and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Following IRF3 or empty plasmid transfection for 24 hrs and subsequent 6 hrs of poly(I:C) or mock stimulation, cells were either mock infected or infected with VSV-GFP in serum-free media. Human and E. fuscus cells were infected with 5.5 x 10 4 TCID50/ml of VSV-GFP. P. alecto cells were infected with 2.75 x 10 3 TCID50/ml of VSV-GFP. For IRF3-S396 phosphorylation assay in E. fuscus cells, Efk3B cells were infected with 80 HA units of Sendai virus. Infected cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr with gentle rocking every 15 minutes. After 1 hr, virus inoculum was aspirated and Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) with Earle's salts (Sigma) containing 2% FBS and 1% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC; Sigma) was added on the cells. The plates were incubated for 19 hrs (VSV-GFP) at 37\u00b0C and green fluorescent protein (GFP) levels were measured using a typhoon scanner (Amersham). Sendai virus infected cells were incubated for 6 hrs and cell lysates were processed for immunoblots.\n\nCells were seeded at a concentration of 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well in 12-well plates and transfected with varying concentrations of IRF3 expression plasmids. Cells were harvested 24 hrs after transfection. Samples were denatured in a reducing sample buffer and analyzed on a reducing gel. Proteins were blotted from the gel onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon, Milipore) and detected using primary and secondary antibodies. Primary antibodies used were: 1:1000 mouse anti-GAPDH (EMD Milipore; Catalogue number: AB2302; RRID: AB_10615768), 1:1000 rabbit anti-IRF3 (Abcam; Catalogue number: ab68481; RRID: AB_11155653) and 1:1000 rabbit anti-pIRF3-S396 (Cell Signaling technology; Catalogue number: 4947S; RRID: ab_823547 ). Secondary antibodies used were: 1:5000 donkey anti-rabbit 800 (LI-COR Biosciences; Catalogue number: 926-32213; RRID: 621848) and 1:5000 goat antimouse 680 (LI-COR Biosciences; Catalogue number: 925-68070; RRID: AB_2651128). Blots were observed and imaged using Image Studio (LI-COR Biosciences) on the Odyssey CLx imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). For the detection of ISG56, GAPDH and IRF3 in THF and CRISPR/Cas9 modified THF cells ( Figure S1D ), enhanced luminol-based chemiluminescence was used as previously described (Noyce et al., 2006) . Primary antibodies used were: 1:1000 rabbit anti-IRF3 (Santa Cruz; Catalogue number: sc-9082; RRID: AB_2264929), mouse anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz; Catalogue number: sc-47724; RRID: AB_627678) and rabbit anti-ISG56 (gift from Dr. Ganes Sen). Peroxidase conjugated goat antirabbit (Sigma; Catalogue number: A0545; RRID: AB_257896) and goat anti-mouse (Sigma; Catalogue number: A8786; RRID: AB_258413) secondary antibodies were used for the chemiluminescent immunoblots. Films were scanned on a typhoon scanner (Amersham).\n\n1.5 x 10 5 cells/well were seeded in 12-well plates and incubated at 37\u00baC and 5% CO2. 24 hrs after seeding cells, 100 ng of IRF3-S185 expression plasmids were transfected into cells. After 24 hrs, media was changed and cells were wither mock treated with DMSO or treated with various concentrations of the inhibitor (Amlexanox, InvivoGen) for 1 hr at 37\u00baC. After 1 hr, cells were mock treated or transfected with poly(I:C). 3-6 hrs after poly(I:C) transfection, cells were harvested for immunoblots or infected with VSV-GFP.\n\nImmunoblot bands were quantified using Image Studio (LI-COR Biosciences).\n\nData analysis were performed using SPSS statistics package version 21. All data are shown as Mean \u00b1 SD. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test with two-tailed, 95% confidence. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01 and *** p < 0.001).
