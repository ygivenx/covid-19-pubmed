{"title": "4 Haematological disorders associated with feline retrovirus infections", "body": "Exogenous FeLVs are classified based on the ability of the provirus to replicate and form infectious virions (replication-competent) or on the requirement for a 'helper' virus (replication-defective) ( Table 1) . Replication-defective FeLVs contain mutations, deletions, insertions, and/or transduced cellular gene sequences which interfere with the production, assembly, and/or packaging of infectious viral particles. Although replication-defective FeLV genes may be actively expressed and the proviral genome fully transcribed, transmission of the defective virus genome requires packaging in a pseudotype virion produced by a coinfecting replication-competent helper FeLV.\n\nReplication-competent FeLVs are subclassified into subgroups A, B, or C, based on differences within regions of the viral surface envelope glycoprotein that define the host cell range, the in vitro interference pattern, and susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies (Sarma and Log, 1971; Sarma et al, 1975; Jarrett, 1980) (Table 1 ). Subgroup A virus is found in all FeLVinfected cats and is isolated alone in two-thirds of healthy viraemic cats. Thus, FeLV-A appears to represent the prototypic, highly contagious FeLV with low to moderate pathogenicity (Jarrett et al, 1978) . Subgroup B FeLVs are always isolated with FeLV-A, and a majority of viraemic cats with clinical illnesses harbour FeLV-B (Jarrett et al, 1978) . These observations suggest that FeLV-B is more highly pathogenic and/or that the virus arises in vivo during long-standing infection with FeLV-A. Subgroup C FeLV also is always associated with FeLV-A; however, FeLV-C is only rarely isolated in naturally infected cats (approximately 1% of cases) (Jarrett et al, 1978) , and subgroup C strains are specifically associated with pure red cell aplasia Onions et al, 1982) .\n\nEndogenous retroviruses are identified in the uninfected domestic cat genome. These include sequences homologous to FeLV (enFeLV) and regions genetically unrelated to FeLV (RD-114 viruses) ( Table 1) . The enFeLV sequences, present at 7-12 copies per haploid genome, consist of full-length and subgenomic regions that are dissimilar from exogenous FeLV in variable regions of the env gene and in the U3 portion of the long terminal repeat (Niman et al, 1980; Casey et al, 1981; Soe et al, 1985; Berry et at, 1988; Kumar et al, 1989) . There is no evidence that full-length enFeLV proviruses produce infectious virus; however, these sequences may play a role in disease. For example, enFeLV genes are expressed in both FeLVpositive and FeLV-negative lymphomas (Niman et al, 1977a; Neil et al, 1990) , and these gene products may be responsible for the associated antibodies to an FeLV-related putative tumour-specific antigen (the feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen; FOCMA) (Snyder et al, 1983 ). In addition, exogenous subgroup A FeLV can recombine with enFeLV env gene sequences to generate FeLV subgroup B variants (Stewart et al, 1986; Overbaugh et al, 1988a) which could have increased pathogenicity. The RD-I14 sequences are expressed in lymphoid and nonlymphoid tumours of FeLV-positive or negative cats (Niman et al, 1977a,b) . However, cats do not mount a serological response to RD-114 products and there is no evidence that RD-114 sequences are involved in recombination events with exogenous FeLV. Furthermore, a replication-competent strain of endogenous RD-114 is generally considered to be noninfectious in cat cells (Dunn et al, 1993) , suggesting that RD-114 virus cannot be readily transmitted in vivo. Therefore, a pathogenic role of RD-114 remains undefined.\n\nViral C-type particles were recognized by Jarrett and colleagues in 1964 as the transmissible agent that induced lymphosarcomas in kittens inoculated with a primary tumour cell homogenate (Jarrett et al, 1964a,b) . These observations were the first to characterize an oncogenic retrovirus in an outbred mammalian species.\n\nThe virions of infectious FeLV are 110-120 nm in diameter ( Figure 1 ). Virions bind to susceptible host cells through interactions of the surface envelope glycoprotein (SU) with subgroup-specific cell membrane receptors. After viral entry and provirus integration, viral genes are expressed and SU is displayed on the host cell membrane. The display of viral SU prevents superinfection of the host cell by FeLVs of the same subgroup (i.e. the concept of viral interference). Specific cell membrane receptors for subgroup A and subgroup B FeLVs have been identified by ligand-receptor biochemical studies and receptor cross-interference assays, respectively (Ghosh et al, 1992; Takeuchi et al, 1992) . However, more recent studies have revealed that heterogenous SU molecules from closely related strains of FeLV can compete for binding to a common cell membrane receptor but that superinfection interference may still not be established (Reinhart et al, 1993) . These observations suggest that FeLV either binds to a family of closely related, but distinct, primary cell surface receptors, or that secondary cell surface receptors and/or additional membrane-related factors are involved in virus entry and establishment of interference.\n\nReplication-competent FeLV proviral DNA is roughly 8.4 kb in length and consists of a 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), gag, pol, and env open reading frames, and a 3' LTR (Neil and Onions, 1985; Donahue et al, 1988) ( Figure 2 ). Each LTR contains redundant (R) sequences flanked by 5' and 3' unique regions (U5 and U3, respectively). There are no identified accessory genes encoding regulatory proteins in FeLV, as there are in FIV and other lentiviruses, or in bovine, simian, and human oncornaviruses. Proviral gene expression is regulated by cis-acting promoter and enhancer sequences in the U3 region of the LTR. This region contains a cluster of consensus sequences that encode putative binding sites for nuclear proteins ( Figure 1 ) (Fulton et al, 1990; Plumb et al, 1991) . The two major transcription products of proviral DNA are a full-length RNA, which is either incorporated as infectious virion RNA or used as the template for trans- products (lower figures), Replication-competent proviral DNA is roughly 8.4 kb in length and contains gag, pol, and ozv structural genes without identified accessory genes encoding regulatory proteins. The U3 region of the LTR contains consensus sequences encoding binding motifs. Binding motifs identified in the U3 region of FeLV-A/Glasgow-I are depicted (derived from data in Fulton et al (1990) ). These include sequences homologous to LVB and nuclear factor l (NF1) binding sites, the SV 40 core enhancer sequence (CORE), a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) sequence, and a novel FeLV-specific binding site (FLV-1), The FeLV precursor proteins and the known and deduced mature proteins are discussed in detail in the text. lation of the gag or gag-pol precursor proteins, and a spliced 3.0kb env mRNA (Mullins and Hoover, t990) . Precursor and mature FeLV protein products have been characterized, in part, by peptide sequence data, known and deduced molecular weights, and functional activity. These protein products, designated by standard nomenclature (Leis et al, 1988) , are illustrated in Figure 1 (Nell and Onions, 1985; Mullins and Hoover, 1990) . The primary gag and gag-pol gene products include: gPrS0 gag, a glycosylated protein that does not undergo further modifications; Pr65 gag, a precursor that is cleaved to yield the core viral matrix (MA; p15), capsid (CA; p27), nucleocapsid (NC; pl 0) (Copeland et al, 1984) , and p12 (unclassified) proteins; and Prl80 gag-pol which is ultimately processed into the reverse transcriptase (RT; p70), protease (PR; 13) (Yoshinaka et al, 1985) , and putative integration protein (IN; p47). The spliced env mRNA is translated and processed to an 80--85 kDa glycosylated precursor (Posset al, 1989) , gPr 85 env, which is cleaved to form the mature surface glycoprotein (SU; gp70) and transmembrane protein (TM; pl5E). Viral protein synthesis and virion production usually occur at a high rate in cells infected with replication-competent FeLV. In particular, cells produce an excess of the Pr65 gag precursor protein. This excess cytoplasmic and extracellular (plasma) gag antigen can be readily detected by immunoassays of clinical blood samples from infected cats (Hardy and Zuckerman, 1991a) . As the detection of intracellular gag antigen in peripheral blood cells correlates highly with the ability to isolate virus (Hardy and Zuckerman, 1991b; Jarrett et al, 1991) , such assays have been widely used in veterinary practice to diagnose persistent FeLV infection.\n\nHigh titres of infectious, cell-free FeLV are found in the saliva, nasal secretions, and plasma of cats with chronic viraemia (Francis et al, 1977) . The virus is horizontally transmitted by repeated, close social contact (mutual grooming, sneezing, shared feeding), and can be vertically transmitted from queens to fetuses (Hardy et al, 1973 (Hardy et al, , 1976 Jarrett et al, 1973) . The ultimate consequences of exposure to FeLV depend upon the host immune responses. Within 2 to 12 days after oronasal transmission, FeLV replicates in tonsillar lymphocytes and macrophages, lymph node follicular centre cells, the thymus, spleen, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (Rojko et al, 1979) . Serum ~-interferon activity increases within 3 days of experimental FeLV infection, but e~-interferon levels do not increase (Rojko and Kociba, 1991) . At 2-6 weeks after exposure, marrow nucleated cells become infected, virus is detected in the plasma (gag antigenaemia) and in circulating leukocytes, and both cell mediated and humoral immune responses develop (Rojko et al, 1979; Charreyre and Pedersen, 1991) . In 60% of exposed cats, the virus neutralizing antibody and cell mediated immune responses eradicate detectable plasma and cell associated FeLV (regressor infection). However, one-third to one-half of regressor cats transiently harbour latent virus in marrow myelomonocytic cells (Rojko et al, 1982; Madewell and Jarrett, 1983; Pedersen et al, 1984) and stromal fibroblast cells (Linenberger, 1990) , as viral replication can be reactivated by culturing these cells in the presence of corticosteroids. Although latent FeLV infection has been experimentally reactivated in regressor cats by exogenous corticosteroid administration, the frequency of spontaneous reactivation in nature is likely to be extremely low.\n\nPersistent viraemia with FeLV occurs in roughly 30% of exposed cats, These animals fail to mount an adequate immune response by 8 weeks after exposure and develop chronic productive infection involving the marrow, lymph node, epithelial, and glandular tissue cells (Rojko et al, 1979) . Chronic infection is associated with a greater than 80% mortality rate at 3-4 years, mostly due to immunosuppressive and/or cytopenic complications (McCleUand et al, 1980) . Approximately 10% of cats with natural infection, and 25% of cats with experimental infection, mount an incomplete immune response to virus challenge resulting in an atypical or sequestered, active FeLV infection (Hoover and Mullins, 1991; Hayes et al, 1992) . These animals have nonprotective virus neutralizing antibody titres, no detectable (or only intermit-tent) antigenaemia or virus in the blood, but evidence of productively infected cells (i.e. intracytoplasmic gag antigen expression) in histological sections of lymphoid, mammary gland, and occasionally intestinal tissues. This condition is relevant to other observations that FeLV-exposed, but antigennegative, cats have higher rates of infection and illness than nonexposed cats (Swenson et al, 1990) , suggesting that the subclinical expression of sequestered virus in some cases may play a role in chronic immune dysfunction.\n\nThe acute stage of infection with FeLV (i.e. early viraemia) may be associated with transient haematological abnormalities. For example, early viraemia induced by disease-associated strains of FeLV is often accompanied by mild to moderate pancytopenia with marrow hypocellularity (Pedersen et al, 1977) and CD4 + T-lymphocytopenia (Tompkins et al, 1991) . These cytopenias usually resolve within a few weeks. In addition, inoculation of neonatal kittens with an acute immunodeficiency-inducing strain of FeLV (FeLV-FAIDS) induces lymphopenia and anaemia associated with rapid weight loss, diarrhoea, and opportunistic infections . In comparison, acute infection with a minimally pathogenic strain of subgroup A FeLV (FeLV-A/61E) is not associated with peripheral blood cytopenias (Linenberger, unpublished observation). Thus, the mechanisms responsible for the haematological abnormalities induced by acute infection with FeLV appear to be related to specific viral strains, and they may also be related to factors such as host age, immune response, and viral load, Long-term, persistent viraemia with FeLV results in chronic degenerative haematolymphatic disorders and/or neoplastic diseases that are frequently accompanied by anaemia. Over half of cats with non-neoplastic FeLVrelated fatal illnesses, and two-thirds with lymphomas (without marrow involvement), have a hypoproliferative anaemia (i.e. with a low reticulocyte count) (Mackey et al, 1975; Hardy, 1980; Reinacher, 1989) . These anaemias may be macrocytic yet unresponsive to vitamin B12 or fotate therapy (Ward et al, 1969; Weiser and Kociba, 1983) . Furthermore, FeLV-induced chronic anaemias may be associated with normal iron levels, increased marrow myeloid-erythroid (M/E) ratio, and improvement after treatment of coexisting infections (Cotter, 1979; Wardrop et al, 1986 ). Thus, one likely mechanism for these anaemias is an inflammatory block of iron utilization secondary to the FeLV-associated malignancies and/or oportunistic infections. Some cases of anaemia are associated with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and increased numbers of circulating nucleated erythrocytes or immature myeloid cells (Mackey et al, 1975; Cotter, 1979) . Such cases may be associated with marrow cell megaloblastic maturation and increased blasts, suggesting that the ineffective haematopoiesis is due to an FeLVinduced myelodysplastic syndrome (Maggio et al, 1978; Madewell et al, 1979; Blue et al, 1988) . Studies have not been carried out on such animals to determine if FeLV-associated myelodysplasia is due to a clonal stem cell process, as it is in man.\n\nSevere pure red cell aplasia occurs in less than 1% of viraemic cats and is specifically associated with subgroup C FeLV. This association has been confirmed by experimental infection studies using biological and molecular clones of FeLV-C (Jarrett et al, 1984; Abkowitz et al, 1985; Riedel et al, 1986) . The pathophysiology and pathogenic viral determinants involved in FeLV-C-induced pure red cell aplasia are discussed below.\n\nA minority of FeLV infected cats (15-20%) suffer from a hyperproliferative anaemia characterized by a high reticulocyte count, decreased marrow M/E ratio, and splenic extramedullary haematopoiesis (Cotter, 1979; Hardy, 1981a) . Hyperproliferative anaemias may be related to blood loss or may be due to haemolysis secondary to coinfection with Hemobartonellafelis, or, rarely, anti-erythrocyte antibodies (Scott et al, 1973) or oxidant stress (Christopher, 1989) . In addition, FeLV-associated hyperproliferative anaemia has been noted to evolve to pancytopenia and leukaemia, suggesting that this disorder may represent a myelodySplastic process.\n\nIsolated neutropenia is much less common than anaemia in cats with persistent FeLV infection. However, a panleukopenia-like syndrome (similar to that caused by feline parvovirus--see Chapter 3), characterized by severe leukopenia (with normal platelet and erythrocyte counts), enteritis, and dysentery, has been reported as the cause of death in up to 9% of FeLV-infected cats (Hardy et al, 1973; Hardy, 1981a , Reinacher, 1989 . FeLV is assumed to be the causal agent, as this disorder has occurred in cats vaccinated against feline panleukopenia virus, and necrotic intestinal tissues contain epithelial and lymphoid cells expressing FeLV antigen. However, recent studies of an outbreak of panleukopenia-like disease in a specificpathogen-free (SPF) cat colony inoculated with FeLV-A/Glasgow revealed the presence of panleukopenia virus antigen in intestinal tissue extracts (Lutz et al, 1993) , suggesting that low levels of this parvovirus may indeed participate in the pathogenesis of this syndrome. Cyclic neutropenia and isolated chronic neutropenia have been rarely diagnosed in FeLV-infected cats, and some cases have been successfully treated with corticosteroids (Gabbert, 1984; Willard, 1985) . More commonly, neutropenia is found associated with anaemia and thrombocytopenia. In addition to quantitative changes, neutrophils from viraemic cats demonstrate functional abnormalities, including impaired chemotaxis and ability to generate an oxidative metabolic burst (Lewis et al, 1986; Kiehl et al, 1987) .\n\nChronic infection with FeLV is commonly associated with a slow decline in circulating and tissue lymphocyte populations, qualitative defects in Tand B-lymphocyte functions, and eventual clinical immunodeficiency (Olsen et al, 1987; Tompkins et al, 1989) . It is unclear whether this natural history is related to intrinsic viral features, or pathogenic features acquired during in vivo viral evolution. Recently, an FeLV strain that induces an acute immunodeficiency syndrome (FeLV-FA1DS) has been isolated, and a number of replication-defective FeLV variants have been directly cloned from tissues of cats infected with FeLV-FAIDS (Overbaugh et al, 1988b) . Experimental infection with the FeLV-FAIDS isolate, the major variant molecular clone (FeLV-61C), or chimeric molecular clones, causes signifi-cant T-lymphopenia, functional lymphocyte defects, and a fatal immunodeficiency syndrome (wasting, diarrhoea, and opportunistic infections) Overbaugh et al, 1988b; Quackenbush et al, 1989 Quackenbush et al, , 1990 Diehl and Hoover, 1992) . High levels of unintegrated viral DNA have been detected in marrow cells of cats infected with the FeLV-FAIDS strain, suggesting that host cell death in vivo is related to a lack of superinfection interference by the FeLV-FAIDS variant (Mullins et al, 1986) . This hypothesis has been supported by in vitro studies that revealed that FeLV-FAIDS variant-induced cytopathicity in a T-lymphocyte cell line is related to defective post-translational processing of the env precursor protein (Poss et al, 1989 (Poss et al, , 1990 , failure to establish superinfection interference, and accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA (Donahue et al, 1991) . Molecular studies have indicated that these phenotypic features, common to multiple FeLV-FAIDS-derived variant and chimeric clones, are mediated by determinants of the env gene encoding the 34 amino acid C-terminal segment of SU Donahue et al, t991; Overbaugh et al, 1992) . Furthermore, the differences in the rapidity and severity of in vivo disease, or in vitro cytopathicity, between individual variant clones appear to be mediated by determinants of env encoding other regions of SU and/or TM (Thomas and Overbaugh, 1993) . Thus, alterations in FeLV env are likely to be important in FeLV-associated immunopathogenesis. It is unknown whether similar mechanisms of host cell cytopathicity occur in the marrow haematopoietic cells and whether such events may play a causal role in the hypoproliferative anaemia associated with FeLV-FAIDS.\n\nLymphomas account for 90% of haematological malignancies in cats. Roughly two-thirds of lymphomas occur in FeLV-infected animals (Cotter et al, 1975) . In addition, many of the FeLV-negative lymphomas occur in cats with significant prior exposure to FeLV or with latent virus in marrow nucleated cells, suggesting an indirect, or 'hit-and-run' role of the virus in these cases Francis et al, 1981) .\n\nThe majority of FeLV-associated lymphomas present as metastatic thymic turnouts or as a multicentric disease involving multiple nodal and extranodal sites (Hardy, 1981b; Hoover and Mullins, 1991) . These tumours consist of a clonal population of malignant lymphocytes, as identified by clonal retroviral integration sites, histochemical staining patterns, cell surface antigen expression, and, in some cases, rearrangement of the T-cell receptor [3-chain gene (Casey et al, 1981; Rojko et al, 1989) . However, thymic lymphomas induced by the Rickard strain of FeLV may consist of cells bearing either mature T-lineage membrane antigens (e.g. CD4 and/or CD8) (Nelson et al, 1993) , prothymocyte features (terminal transferase and Ia antigens, without CD4 or CD8), or monocyte/nuU cell features (nonspecific esterase and Ia antigens, but without any lymphoid markers) (Rojko et al, 1989; Nelson et al, 1993) , suggesting that the transformed host target cell may be, in some cases, a monocytic precursor or a multilineage precursor. A group of FeLV-associated splenic lymphomas have also been described which contain malignant cells that are not T-lymphocytes (i.e. no rearrangement of the T-cell receptor gene) or B-lymphocytes (i.e. no rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene), further indicating that FeLV has the potential to induce transformation of a wide range of host cell phenotypes within lymphoid organs (Levesque et al, 1990) . The least common type of FeLV-associated lymphoma is alimentary lymphoma, which affects predominantly the intestines, mesenteric lymph nodes, and visceral abdominal organs; these tumours consist of either malignant Tlymphocytes or B-lymphocytes.\n\nPrimary neoplastic disorders involving the marrow occur less frequently than lymphomas in FeLV-infected cats. These disorders include myelodysplastic syndromes, acute nonlymphocytic leukaemias (ANLL), and acute lymphocytic leukaemias (ALL). Roughly 75% of cats with myelodysplastic syndromes, 90% with ANLL and 70% with ALL are infected with FeLV, suggesting that FeLV plays a causal role in those disorders (Francis et al, 1979; Blue et al, 1988) .\n\nThe myelodysplastic syndromes include haematological disorders associated with marrow hypercellularity, megaloblastic maturation abnormalities, increased reticulin fibrosis and increased numbers of immature cells and blasts (5-30% of nucleated cells) (Maggio et al, 1978; Madewell et al, 1979; Hardy, 1980; Blue, 1988; Blue et al, 1988) . Peripheral blood abnormalities include severe hypoproliferative anaemia, erythrocyte macrocytosis, occasional pancytopenia, and increased numbers of circulating immature erythroid cells. Extramedullary haematopoiesis occurs in the liver and spleen of these animals, resulting in organomegaly. These disorders may evolve to frank acute leukaemia or persist with morbidity and mortality due to severe anaemia, infections, and haemorrhage. An experimental model of myelodysplasia and myeloid leukaemia induced by the strain FeLV-AB/ GM1 has been characterized (Toth et al, 1986; Testa et al, 1988) and is discussed below.\n\nAcute nonlymphocytic leukaemia is diagnosed in FeLV-infected cats with high numbers of circulating myeloid or erythroid blasts or, more commonly, in cats with peripheral blood cytopenias and infrequent numbers of circulating blasts, but with -> 30% blasts in the marrow . Hepatosplenomegaly with extramedullary leukaemic infiltration is frequently found. The leukaemia cells, characterized by morphological and histochemical features, are most commonly myeloblasts; they are less commonly erythroblasts and only rarely consistent with myelomonocytic, basophilic, eosinophilic, or megakaryocytic lineages (Fraser et al, 1974; Cotter et al, 1975; Stann, 1979; Hardy, 1980; Toth et al, 1986; Facklam and Kociba, 1986; Blue et al, 1988) . The incidence of ANLL among FeLV-infected cats is thought to be low (10% of all haematological malignancies), however, this may be an underestimation, as a careful marrow evaluation is frequently required, but often not pursued, to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nALL occurs in 8-40% of all FeLV-infected cats diagnosed with lymphoid malignancies (Cotter and Essex, 1977; Hardy, 1980) . In comparison, metastatic involvement of the marrow with malignant lymphocytes occurs in one-third of FeLV-infected cats with lymphoma. Primary ALL infrequently presents with leukocytosis or lymphocytosis (only in 10 or 40% of cases, respectively) (Cotter and Essex, 1977) , and therefore it is most often diagnosed after marrow studies are done to evaluate severe neutropenia and/or hypoproliferative anaemia. Marrow ALL blasts are recognized by positive staining for acid phosphate and periodic acid Schiff (Facklam and Kociba, 1986) but the diagnosis usually is made based on morphology of Wright-Giemsa stained specimens, the absence of cytochemical staining for myeloid markers, and the absence of associated dysmyelopoietic features.\n\nAbnormal proliferation of marrow mesenchymal cells in FeLV-infected cats results in myelofibrosis or osteosclerosis. Increased reticulin staining and/or fibrosis have been noted in marrow biopsies from one-third to one-half of cats with myelodysplastic syndromes or ANLL (Blue, 1988) . As FeLV infects a high frequency of fibroblast precursor cells (Linenberger and Abkowitz, 1992) , this process could result from direct effects of the virus on marrow fibroblast cell growth. Alternatively, myelofibrosis could represent a reactive process induced by altered cytokine production by infected cells within the marrow microenvironment. Medullary osteosclerosis, characterized by an overgrowth of bony trabeculae into the marrow cavity of the long bones, is associated with subgroup C FeLV infections . It is undetermined whether the abnormal osteocyte proliferation is a direct effect of viral infection or a response to the local effects of FeLV-C and/or cytokines.\n\nFeLV-C, although isolated infrequently from community cats, is epidemiologically associated with severe anaemia (Onions et al, 1982) . When such isolates are inoculated into newborn kittens, the anaemia rapidly develops (Mackey et al, 1975; Onions et al, 1982) , suggesting that a multistep pathogenic process is not required. Similarly, in vivo passaged, in vitro passaged, and molecularly cloned FeLV-C/Sarma induce a hypoproliferative anaemia in experimentally infected cats Testa et al, 1983; Abkowitz et al, 1985; Riedel et al, 1986; Dornsife et aL 1989) . This feline disorder satisfies all criteria for human pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) (Ammus and Yunis, 1987) ; profound anaemia (haematocrits range from 4-15%), an absence or near-absence of reticulocytes in the blood, and the marrow lacks haemoglobinized cells. The erythropoietin level is high and ferrokinetic studies confirm that erythropoiesis is severely diminished, but that red cell survival is normal Wardrop et at, 1986) . Occasionally, cats with late-stage disease will develop associated mild granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and/or osteosclerosis .\n\nAll cats that are chronically viraemic with subgroup C FeLV develop PRCA. The onset of anaemia in neonatal and immunocompromised cats is faster than that in adult animals (Boyce et al, 1981; Abkowitz et al, 1985) . These data suggest that the PRCA results directly from viral replication and not as a consequence of a host immune response. Consistent with this, in vitro studies have failed to demonstrate aberrant populations of T-cells or ivl. L. LINENBERGER AND J. L. ABKOWITZ autoantibodies that recognize erythropoietin or antigenic determinants on normal or infected erythroid progenitor cells in infected cats (Abkowitz et al, 1987a) . Similarly, feline PRCA fails to respond to immunosuppressive therapies such as prednisone, antithymocyte globulin (Zack and Kociba, 1988) , cyclosporine, or cyclophosphamide. Other studies have demonstrated that FeLV-C/Sarma-induced PRCA is not a clonal or neoplastic disorder (Abkowitz et al, 1985) .\n\nIn longitudinal studies of experimentally infected cats, we have characterized FeLV-C/Sarma-induced PRCA from a physiological perspective. Within a few weeks of the onset of anaemia, CFU-E decrease in number while BFU-E are preserved (Abkowitz et al, 1987b; Abkowitz, 1991) . Because BFU-E are able to develop into erythroid bursts in vitro, the conditions of the methylcellulose culture permit full erythroid maturation. We therefore reasoned that the CFU-E were no longer present in the cat and that PRCA reflected an in vivo block in the ability of BFU-E to mature to CFU-E. Thus, FeLV-C/Sarma has a lineage (erythroid) and stage-specific (BFU-E to CFU-E) effect. Other investigators have observed extremely low frequencies (or absence) of BFU-E within a few weeks of viral inoculation (Boyce et al, 1981; Testa et al, 1983) . It is possible that this discrepancy reflects a higher quantity of viral inoculum, the use of specific pathogen-free versus immunologically intact cats, the infection of younger (versus adult) animals, or the use of different conditions for in vitro BFU-E growth. As lymphoid cells, granulocytic cells, megakaryocytes, CFU-GM, and marrow fibroblasts are also infected with FeLV-C/Sarma in viraemic animals, this specificity is not the result of restricted range of target cells Abkowitz et al, 1987c; Dean et al, 1992; Linenberger and Abkowitz, 1992a) .\n\nTo determine the viral components required for PRCA, Mullins and colleagues constructed chimeric retroviruses containing regions of FeLV-A/ 61E and C/Sarma viruses (Riedel et al, 1988; Brojatsch et al, 1992) . Although most env sequence is conserved among FeLVs, the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the SU glycoprotein of FeLV-C/Sarma (and of FeLV subgroup B viruses) differ from all FeLV-A isolates in four discrete regions (designated variable regions 1--4) (VR1-4). Viral constructs which contain a 723 base pair region that encodes the N-terminal 241 amino acids of SU of FeLV-C/Sarma (which include VR1-3) induce PRCA when inoculated into neonatal cats. No anaemia is seen when comparable animals are inoculated with viruses which contain the FeLV-A sequences in the region of env. Using a similar experimental strategy, Rigby et al (1992) demonstrated that the sequences of env encoding the 30 amino acid VR1 region of FeLV-C/Sarma SU contain the required determinants for anaemia. Of major interest, FeLV-A recombinant viruses which contain VR-1 from FeLV-C/Sarma retained the ability to infect guinea pig cells in culture (Riedel et al, 1988; Brojatsch et al, 1992; Rigby et al, 1992) , a unique feature of subgroup C viruses. In contrast, viruses lacking the FeLV-C/ Sarma VR-1 could not infect guinea pig cells. Thus, it appears that the 30 amino acid region of SU which is required for anaemia is also necessary to infect target cells. These observations suggest the possibility that the cell surface receptor for FeLV-C/Sarma is necessary for normal erythroid differentiation (i.e. is essential for BFU-E maturation to CFU-E). Theoretically, excess FeLV-C/Sarma SU glycoprotein could impair the cell surface expression of this receptor and/or its ability to bind its physiological ligand (i.e. the same mechanisms involved in viral superinfection interference) and thus inhibit erythropoiesis. In additional studies, the SU encoding env gene regions of three additional natural isolates of FeLV-C (FZ215, FA27, FS246) were recently sequenced (Brojatsch et al, 1992) . The VR1 sequence of each clone was unique and distinct from the conserved pattern of FeLV-A viruses, suggesting that different structural changes in this region can result in a convergent phenotype.\n\nDoes the SU glycoprotein of FeLV-C/Sarma directly impair BFU-E differentiation, as implied above? The behaviour of BFU-E, but not CFU-GM, from cats with FeLV-C/Sarma-induced PRCA is abnormal in vitro. The percentage of BFU-E in the S phase of the cell cycle is two times the controls, BFU-E from these cats are usually sensitive to in vitro lysis after exposure to complement, and progenitors are poorly responsive to the haematopoietic growth factor, kit ligand (Abkowitz et al, 1987b ,c, Abkowitz, 1991 Abkowitz, unpublished observation) . In addition, highly enriched populations of BFU-E fail to differentiate in the presence of FeLV-C/Sarma in suspension cultures (Abkowitz, unpublished observation) .\n\nCould feline PRCA be a non-immune consequence of the effects of FeLV-C/Sarma on accessory ceils within the marrow microenvironment? Recent studies of Kahn et al (1993) suggest that TNF release by FeLV-C/ Sarma-infected monocytes might play a role in PRCA. This is an unlikely explanation for the specific and complete inhibition of erythropoiesis, as monocytes infected with FeLV-A also induce TNF (though perhaps at a lower titre) (Khan eta!, 1993) , and many other retroviruses, including FIV, induce TNF expression in vivo (see later discussion). However, additional effects of the SU glycoprotein and/or other viral components (e.g. the LTR ) on microenvironmental and lymphoid target cells could influence disease severity.\n\nSeveral virus and host cell mechanisms are likely to be involved in the multistep pathogenesis of FeLV-induced lymphomas. Studies of DNA sequences from lymphoid tumours have revealed some recurrent patterns of viral genotypic features and host genetic alterations with putative direct and indirect roles in tumorigenesis. First, thymic lymphomas that developed in cats inoculated with a minimally pathogenic molecular clone, FeLV-A/61E, were found to contain proviral variants with env gene deletions, truncation mutations, and env insertion mutations (Rohn et al, 1994) . Such env gene mutations may contribute to viral pathogenicity in general by affecting the processing and display of SU (perhaps altering superinfection interference) or they could contribute more directly to lymphomagenesis by affecting cell membrane signalling events and altering cell growth.\n\nSecond, some thymic tumours associated with FeLV-A/61E (Rohn et al, 1994) or the Rickard strain of FeLV (FeLV-A/R) (Fulton et al, 1990; Neil et al, 1991) and some spontaneous FeLV-associated lymphoid (and myeloid) malignancies (Matsumoto et al, 1992) are linked to proviruses that contain direct repeats of enhancer motifs in the U3 region of the LTR. These LTR repeats likely augment the enhancer and promoter functions of the viral LTR; and they would increase the expression of nearby rearranged host proto-oncogenes. Third, integration of FeLV provirus DNA next to specific host protooncogene sequences may be an important step in the pathogenesis of spontaneous and experimentally induced lymphomas. Insertional mutagenesis of the c-myc proto-oncogene has been noted in 7-38% of spontaneous FeLV-associated lymphomas and in up to 50-75% of thymic lymphomas experimentally induced by FeLV-A/R (Neil et al, 1984; Miura et al, 1987; Neil et al, 1987; Mullins and Hoover, 1990; Rezanka et al, 1992; Levy et al, 1993a) . In cases of FeLV-A/R-induced lymphomas, the provirus is usually integrated upstream and in the opposite orientation of c-myc, suggesting that the enhancer function of the LTR drives c-myc overexpression. Recently, a unique common integration site of FeLV proviruses, named flvi-2, was identified in spontaneous thymic lymphomas and in experimentally induced T-cell lymphomas (Levy and Lobelle-Rich, 1992; Levy et al, 1993a) . Theflvi-2 locus has been identified as the feline homologue of the murine brni-1 gene (Levy et al, 1993b) . Murine bmi-1 encodes a nuclear protein, and rearrangement of this proto-oncogene accelerates the development of B-cell lymphomas in Etx-myc transgenic mice infected with Moloney murine leukaemia virus (Haupt et al, 1991; Van Lohuizen et al, 1991) . In FeLV-positive lymphomas, provirus is generally integrated downstream of brni-1, suggesting that the LTR enhancer activates the bmi-1 promoter, stimulating an increase in bmi-1 expression. Additional studies have revealed a 54% co-occurrence of rearranged, or overexpressed, c-myc among 13 natural or experimentally induced FeLVpositive tumours with rearranged flvi-2 (Levy et al, 1993a) . Thus, protooncogene cooperativity likely plays a major role in the development of these T-cell lymphomas. Additional unique common integration sites, designated flvi-1 (Levesque et al, 1990) , and fit-1 (Tsujimoto et al, 1993) , have been identified in four of seven naturally occurring FeLV-associated splenic non-T-cell lymphomas and in T-cell tumours induced by recombinant FeLV proviruses containing a transduced v-myc gene, respectively. Although the flvi-1 gene locus is highly conserved among mammals (Levesque et al, 1991) , the identity of this putative proto-oncogene and its role in leukaemogenesis remain undefined. Similarly, the nucleotide sequence of theflt-I region does not show any close match to identified proto-oncogene sequences (Tsujimoto et al, 1993) .\n\nFinally, recombinant FeLV proviruses containing either transduced enFeLV sequences or cellular proto-oncogene sequences likely play an important role in some lymphomas. Recombinant proviral variants containing env gene sequences originating from enFeLV are detected in threefourths of FeLV-positive spontaneous thymic and alimentary lymphomas and in one-third of multicentric lymphomas (Sheets et al, 1993) . Some of these recombinants contain mutations affecting a region of env that encodes an important immunogenic epitope of SU, suggesting that these variants might contribute to lymphomagenesis by facilitating escape from immune surveillance, enhancing the host cell range of the viruses, and/or by increasing host cell superinfection and the chance of a mutagenic event.\n\nRecombinant FeLV variants containing a transduced c-myc gene (FeLVmyc isolates) have also been characterized (Levy et al, 1984; Mullins et al, 1984; Neil et al, 1984; Rezanka et al, 1992 ). In all isolates tested, infection of tissue culture cells or inoculation of neonatal kittens with FeLV-myc (along with a helper FeLV) does not result in neoplastic transformation in vitro or the acute induction of multiclonal tumours in vivo (Bonham et al, 1987; Onions et al, 1987; Levy et al, 1988; Doggett et al, 1989) . Rather, these recombinants induce shorter-latency, clonal T-cell lymphomas that apparently arise after acquisition of additional de novo mutagenic events. Experimental evidence for this hypothesis came from observations that coinfection of cells with FeLV-myc and a ras-expressing retrovirus resulted in in vitro transformation (Doggett et al, 1989) . Evidence that additional mutagenic events cooperate with FeLV-myc in vivo came with the discovery in an FeLV-myc-containing tumour of a second recombinant provirus containing a transduced portion of the T-cell antigen receptor [3-chain gene (Fulton et al, 1987) . This observation, and the finding of rearrangements of both c-myc and flvi-2 in individual thymic lymphomas (Levy et al, 1993a) support the hypothesis that FeLV-induced lymphomas arise as a result of a multistep process.\n\nThe FeLV-AB/GM1 strain induces acute myelodysplasia and myeloid leukaemia in neonatal kittens. Inoculated animals develop trilineage marrow morphological abnormalities within 2 weeks, pancytopenia and increased marrow blasts at 3-5 weeks, and frank myeloblastic or myelomonocytic leukaemia after 7 weeks (Toth et al, 1986; Testa et al, 1988) . Marrow culture studies performed on inoculated cats reveal an early polyclonal expansion of CFU-GM (starting at week 2), with an apparent enhanced sensitivity of progenitor cells to low levels of colony-stimulating activity in serum (Testa et al, 1988 ). This pattern is followed by a decrease in CFU-GM frequencies and an increase in the growth of small cell clusters correlating with increased marrow blasts. Long-term marrow cultures from cats with myelodysplasia induced by FeLV-AB/GM1 maintain CFU-GM poorly, consistent with an additional effect of the virus on the marrow microenvironment (Testa et al, 1988) . Inoculation of kittens with a mixture of molecular clones of subgroup A and subgroup B viruses derived from fibroblasts infected with FeLV-AB/GM-1 induced early expansion of the marrow CFU-GM population followed by a later appearance of small cell clusters in clony-forming assays (Tzavaras et al, 1990) . However, marrow morphological and peripheral blood changes did not occur in the majority of these animals, and only FeLV-A was isolated in the one cat that developed myeloid leukaemia. These observations suggest that specifc strains of FeLV may directly alter the growth of marrow progenitors and the function of marrow accessory cells, promoting rapid evolution to myeloid leukaemia. The causal role of the FeLV-B variants in this experimental model of myeloid leukaemia has not been defined, and therefore it is unclear whether enFeLV sequences may be important. Furthermore, additional molecular studies are needed to determine the roles of viral factors such as mutations of env or other genes, LTR duplications, or transduced host cell proto-oncogene sequences in the pathogenesis of FeLV-induced myeloid leukaemias. Genes important in myeloid cell growth and differentiation may be deregulated by FeLV insertional mutagenesis or transduction events, analogous to the findings with FeLV-associated lymphomas.\n\nAccessory cells within the marrow microenvironment provide the structural framework, cytoadhesive molecules, and growth-regulatory cytokines necessary for normal haematopoiesis. As marrow macrophages, Tlymphocytes, and stromal fibroblasts are known targets of FeLV in vivo, alteration of the haematopoietic-supporting function of these accessory cells could play a role in FeLV-induced haematological diseases.\n\nInfection of feline embryonic fibroblasts with subgroup A or subgroup C FeLV induces the secretion of soluble multilineage colony-stimulating activity (CSA) . Theoretically, such an effect on accessory cells in the marrow microenvironment in vivo could indirectly promote leukaemogenesis by stimulating the proliferation and outgrowth of a neoplastic haematopoietic cell clone. Heterogenous long-term marrow culture stromal cells infected with FeLV support the generation of two-to three-fold greater numbers of nonadherent CFU-GM and total nonadherent cells, compared to uninfected stromal cells (Linenberger and Abkowitz, 1992b) . Further studies, however, have revealed that FeLV infection down-modulates the production of soluble progenitor growthinhibitory activity by heterogenous marrow stromal cells or marrow fibroblasts, without altering production of soluble CSA by these stromal cells (Linenberger and Abkowitz et al, 1992c) .\n\nSome studies have revealed impaired in vitro growth of marrow stromal cells from cats infected with highly pathogenic strains of FeLV. For example, fibroblast colony-forming units (CFU-F) or long-term marrow culture stromal cells from cats viraemic with the anemogenic Kawakami-Theilen (KT) strain of FeLV (Wellman et al, 1988) or the leukaemogenic strain FeLV-AB/GM1 (Testa et al, 1988 ) grow poorly in culture, suggesting that FeLV can adversely affect the proliferation and viability of marrow microenvironmental cells. Furthermore, in vitro incubation of normal feline bone marrow cells with purified TM (p15E) protein signifcantly decreases CFU-F-derived colony formation (Wellman et al, 1988) .\n\nTogether, these observations indicate that FeLV and/or viral proteins can affect marrow accessory cell viability, growth, and/or production of haematopoietic progenitor growth-regulating substances. Furthermore, these effects appear to occur in a virus strain-specific and host cell lineagespecific manner. In addition, infected marrow microenvironmental cells provide a reservoir of latent virus (Rojko et al, 1982; Madewell and Jarrett 1983; Pedersen et al, 1984; Linenberger, 1990) , which likely plays a role in the ultimate incidence and severity of disease in nonviraemic, FeLVexposed cats (Francis et al, 1981; Swenson et al, 1990) . Thus, complex interactions occur between accessory cells, accessory cell products, virus, viral products, and haematopoietic progenitor cells ultimately resulting in the cytopenic or proliferative haematological diseases associated with FeLV.\n\nFeline immunodeficiency virus was initially isolated and characterized in 1987 (Pedersen et al, 1987) . The index cases were communal FeLV-negative cats suffering from emaciation, chronic diarrhoea, oral infections, and skin lesions. The transmissible agent in these cases was a T-lymphotropic retrovirus that expressed Mg2+-dependent RT activity. The infectious virions were 120-150 nm in size and contained typical bar-shaped lentivirus nucleocapsids ( Figure 3 ). Subsequent serological surveys, immunoassays, and proviral D N A sequence analyses showed that this feline lentivirus is antigenically and genetically distinct from primate and ungulate lenti- viruses, and is causally associated with an immunodeficiency-like illness (reviewed in Pedersen et al (1989) and Sparger et al (1989) ).\n\nNumerous proviral genomes of FIV have been molecularly cloned (Olmsted et al, 1989; Talbott et al, 1989; Miyazawa et al, 1991; Morikawa et al, 1991; Maki et al, 1992; Siebelink et al, 1992) . The typical FIV genome is about 9500 bases, including open reading frames (ORFs) encoding known and putative regulatory proteins, in addition to gag, pol, and env genes (Figure 4) . Although FIV is biologically and virologically similar to HIV, some genetic features are more closely related to other nonprimate lentiviruses. For example, the FIV pol gene contains sequences encoding . The U3 region of the pF34 LTR contains sequences encoding putative functional binding domains (described in the text). The precursor env protein product gPrl50 \u00a2\"v is processed to gPrt30 e'' by cleavage of the leader (L) region. The gag-pol precursor protein has not been defined. The other precursor and mature protein products are described in the text. Genomic organization of pF34 was derived from data in Talbott et al (1989) and adapted from figures in Sparger et at (1992) , with permission of the author and Academic Press. deoxyuridine triphosphatase (DU), an enzyme that converts deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) to a monophosphate (dUMP) (Wagaman et al, 1993) . This feature is similar to DU-encoding regions of pol in the ungulate lentiviruses (i.e. equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV); caprine arthritisencephalitis virus (CAEV); and visna virus), but different from pol in the primate lentiviruses (i.e. HIV; and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)) or the type-C oncornaviruses) (Elder et al, 1992) . In addition, FIV does not appear to encode a gene product with transcriptional transactivation function (i.e. analogous to the tat protein produced by HIV), suggesting that FIV gene expression may be regulated by mechanisms similar to that of the visna virus (Sparger et al, 1992) . FIV does contain a rev gene, which is encoded by ORF L and ORF H (exon 1 and exon 2, respectively, of rev) (Kiyomasu et al, 1991; Phillips et al, 1992) . The FIV rev gene product most likely functions like the HIV rev protein, as it has been localized to the nucleoli of cells, and putative rev-responsive elements (RRE) have been identified in sequences in the 3' end of env (Phillips et al, 1992) . The FIV ORF 1 appears to encode the vii gene, as the primary gene transcript is a singly spliced mRNA species similar to the HIV viftranscript, and cell-free virions generated from ORF 1 mutants have significantly impaired infectivity (Tomonaga et al, 1992) . The role of ORF 2 in FIV gene regulation has not been defined, however studies with frameshift mutants suggest that this region is required for efficient viral replication in T-lymphocytes (Tomonaga et al, 1993) . The FIV LTR is approximately 360 bases in length. Sequence analyses of molecular clones described to date have identified multiple putative functional domains (see Figure 4 ) Sparger et al, 1992) . Studies utilizing plasmids containing FIV LTR or LTR mutants linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene have revealed a high basal promoter activity in some transfected feline and human cell lines Sparger et al, 1992) . Constitutive LTR-CAT activity is altered by mutation of putative ATF, AP-1, 5' AP-4 or NF-KB sites in some cell lines but not in others (Sparger et al, 1992) . These observations suggest that multiple transcription factors, with perhaps overlapping activities, provide sufficient signals for basal FIV replication. Other studies have revealed that AP-1 and AP-4 sites mediate transcription activation of LTR-CAT in feline T-cells stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin and dibutyryl c-AMP, respectively, suggesting that these sequences are important in the inducible expression of FIV genes . Host cell infection with feline herpesvirus type 1 (Kawaguchi et al, 1991) , but not FeLV (Sparger et al, 1992) , enhances the promoter activity of a transfected LTR-CAT construct. In comparison, only modest enhancement of FIV LTR-CAT activity is noted in some cell lines cotransfected with full-length FIV molecular clones (Sparger et al, 1992) . Thus, the FIV LTR is a strong basal promoter that is activated by host cell factors responding to exogenous stimulation, or by herpesvirus infection; however, LTR activity is only modestly affected by FIV proviral transactivation. FIV replication and gene expression may be most dependent on host cell rather than viral regulatory mechanisms.\n\nThe FIV gene products are depicted in Figure 4 . The sizes of the precursor and mature proteins have been estimated by DNA sequence analysis or determined by immunological methods, isolation of purified protein products, and by ion spray mass spectrometry (Egberink eta|, 1990; North et al, 1990; Steinman et al, 1990; Stephens et al, 1991; Elder et al, 1993) . Similar to FeLV, the FIV gag proteins are produced in great excess compared to other gene products (Elder et al, 1993) . The FIV CA protein (p25) appears to share immunogenic epitopes with CA proteins of EIAV, SIV, and HIV, as determined by radioimmunoprecipitation assay, Western blot assays, and epitope mapping studies (Egberink et al, 1990; Steinman et al, 1990; Matsuo et al, 1992) . Thus, lentivirus gag gene products are related and highly conserved among species. The FIV pol gene products, generated from a putative gag-pol precursor protein, include: a PR protein (p13) that cleaves a family of substrate peptides, similar to the function of HIV-I PR (Farmerie et al, 1991) ; an RT protein (p67) with RNase H activity that is inhibited by drugs that inhibit the RT of other lentiviruses (Cronn et al, 1992) ; a DU protein (p14) that likely functions to limit misincorporation of uracil into proviral DNA (by keeping the level of dUTP low) (Wagaman et al, 1993) ; and a putative IN protein that has not been characterized.\n\nThe primary env gene precursor protein (gPr 150 env) is rapidly processed to a secondary precursor (gPr 130 env) which is ultimately cleaved to generate SU (gp 95) and TM (gp 40) (Stephens et al, 1991; Verschoor et al, 1993) . The FIV env gene contains multiple variable regions with sequences that are divergent among the clones described to date (Morikawa et al, 1991 ; Pancino et al. 1993a ). These variable regions encode immunodominant epitopes in SU and TM (Avrameas et al, 1992; Lombardi et al, 1993; Pancino et al, 1993b; Siebelink et al, 1993) , and therefore they may be important in the escape of FIV from immune surveillance. In addition, FIV env gene variable regions may encode determinants that are important in host cell tropism, infectivity, and pathogenic phenotypic features, analogous to HIV. Evidence that env gene products may play a role in host cell cytopathicity, at least in a host cell lineage-specific fashion, come from one study that showed a correlation between the induction of syncytia and cell death with an altered SU glycosylation pattern (Posset al, 1992) .\n\nFIV, unlike FeLV, is not commonly transmitted by infrequent social contact. Chronic asymptomatic FIV infection is associated with a very low number of infected circulating mononuclear cells and low titres of cell-free virus in serum, plasma, saliva, and cerebrospinal fluid. In comparison, virus is readily recovered from peripheral blood cells and bodily fluids of sick cats with late-stage disease Sparger, 1993) . Experimental transmission studies and demographic data of infection rates among field cats (Hosie et al, 1989; Ishida et al, 1989; Shelton et al, 1989a; Yamamoto et al, 1989; O'Connor et al, 1991) indicate that horizontal FIV transmission occurs primarily by biting and fighting. However, proviral DNA and FIV RNA have been detected in peripheral blood and marrow cells of seronegative cats chronically exposed to docile infected cats (Dandekar et al, 1992) , and therefore social contact transmission may occur under certain circumstances. Venereal transmission of FIV has not been documented. FIV can be transmitted to kittens via maternal milk from queens experimentally infected either during gestation (Wasmoen et al, 1992) or immediately post-partum (Sellon et al, 1994) . Vertical transmission to kittens does not appear to occur from queens in the asymptomatic, chronic stage of infection.\n\nChronic, active FIV infection is associated with a sustained humoral immune response that fails to eradicate virus-infected cells. Thus, chronic FIV infection, like HIV infection, is most easily diagnosed by identifying serum anti-FIV antibodies using Western blot and/or enzyme immunoassay methods (Barr et aL 1991; Egberink et al, 1991) . Utilizing such techniques, large seroepidemiological surveys in the USA, UK, Italy, and Japan have revealed FIV infection prevalence rates of 1.2-11% in healthy domestic cats and 9-89% in sick cats (Hosie et al, 1989; Shelton et al, 1989a; O'Connor et al, 1991; Bandecchi et al, 1992) . Most studies have found no association between FIV seropositivity and FeLV antigenaemia; the peak incidence of FIV infection occurs in outdoor, free-roaming male cats at 5-10 years of age, whereas the peak incidence of FeLV infection occurs in 1-5-year-old cats. In contrast, FIV infection has been highly associated with FeSFV coinfection Bandecchi et al, 1992) .\n\nVirus-host cell interactions and host immune responses have been characterized during experimental primary infection with FIV. Within 4 weeks after inoculation, lymphadenopathy develops, plasma viraemia is detectable, circulating total and CD4 + T-lymphocyte numbers decrease, and FIV-infected peripheral blood CD4 + T-lymphocytes, CD8 + Tlymphocytes, and B-lymphocytes become readily detectable (Yamamoto et al, 1988; Tompkins et al, 1991; English et al, 1993) . Significantly decreased responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), spleen cells, and lymph node ceils to mitogens such as conconavalin A (Con A), phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) are noted within the first 3 weeks post-inoculation, indicating that functional abnormalities rapidly develop in T-lymphocytes during primary infection (Lawrence et al, 1992) . However, interleukin-2 (IL-2) generation by these cells does not appear to be significantly altered, Anti-FIV antibodies, against gag and env gene products and FIV RT, often appear by week 3-4 post-inoculation, however seroconversion may be delayed for many weeks in cats inoculated with a low infectious dose of FIV (Hosie and Jarrett, 1990; Fevereiro et al, 1991; Egberink et al, 1992) .\n\nFrom weeks 4-20 post-FIV inoculation, generalized lyrnphadenopathy persists, systemic symptoms (fever, diarrhoea, depression) develop, and neutropenia occurs (Yamamoto et al, 1988) , During this time the CD4 + T-lymphocyte count recovers and the CD8 + T-lymphocyte numbers increase, resulting in a persistently decreased CD4/CD8 ratio Willett et al, 1993) . In some experimentally infected cats, particularly neonatal kittens and cats aged 7-12 years, CD4 + lymphopenia persists (George et al, 1993) . The increased CD8 + population includes cells that display a low level of CD8 antigens and a relatively high level of major histocompatibility (MHC) class II antigens, suggesting that this population could include natural killer cells . PBMC of cats at week 7 post-inoculation and beyond, demonstrate MHC class I-restricted, CD8 + T-cell mediated cytolytic activity against FIV-infected target cells (Song et al, 1992) . Cell mediated immunity is likely important in the abatement of the high viral replicative activity during acute infection. By 12 weeks postinoculation, increased numbers of FIV-infected B lymphocytes, and relatively fewer infected T-lymphocytes, are detected in peripheral blood (English et al, 1993) . In addition, cats inoculated with acutely immunosuppressive, macrophage-tropic strains of FIV, but not apathogenic strains, have increased numbers of provirus-containing monocytes in their circulation (Dow et al, 1993) . Defective responses of peripheral blood Blymphocytes to mitogenic stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and of T-lymphocytes to recall antigens have been noted at 8-20 weeks postinoculation . Plasma TNF has been detected at high levels in some cats (Lawrence et al, :1992) but not others (Lehmann et al, 1992) with acute FIV infection, thus, the role of inflammatory mediators in the pathophysiology of acute FIV inflection remains unclear.\n\nClinical signs and symptoms associated with experimentally induced acute FIV infection usually resolve by week 20 post-inoculation, but generalized lymphadenopathy may persist for 9 to 12 months. As with HIV infection, primary infection with FIV is associated with a significant viral burden in the lymphoid tissue. Immunohistochemical studies of FIV gag antigen expression (Toyosaki et al, 1993) , or in situ hybridization assays for viral RNA , have revealed infected T-lymphocytes, macrophages, and undefined paracortical cells (possibly dendritic cells) in the lymph nodes of cats necropsied at 3-20 weeks after experimental infection. It is yet to be demonstrated whether there is a relationship between the viral load during primary infection and the subsequent rapidity and severity of the immunopathogenesis during late-stage chronic FIV infection (after an asymptomatic stage of many months to many years).\n\nLate stages of natural or experimental chronic FIV infection are characterized by weight loss, opportunistic infections, lymphoid depletion (occasionally following a recurrence of persistent generalized lymphadenopathy), and haematological abnormalities Yamamoto et al, 1989; Pedersen and Barlough, 1991; Ishida et al, 1992) . Additional clinical disorders noted in field cats include neurological/behavioural abnormalities, ocular disorders, renal disease~ haematological malignancies, and squamous cell carcinoma of the mouth and skin (Pedersen and Barlough, 1991) . These clinical disorders are associated with a progressive decrease in the number of circulating CD4 + T-lymphocytes (Ackley et al, 1990; Novotney et al, 1990; Barlough et al, 1991; Hoffmann-Fezer et al, 1992) . Concomitant abnormalities are detected in the in vitro proliferative responses of PBMC to B-cell mitogens (LPS), T-cell mitogens (Con A and IL-2), a T-celldependent B-cell mitogen (PWM), and a T-cell antigen (keyhole limpet haemocyanin) (Lin et al, 1990; Siebelink et al, 1990; Barlough et al, 1991; Torten et al, 1991; Bishop et al, 1992) . The production of IL-2 by Con A-stimulated PBMC from cats with long-standing experimental FIV infection is also decreased (Siebelink et al, 1990) . Functional T-cell defects are demonstrable in vivo. as the antibody response to a T-cell-dependent immunogen is significantly impaired in cats beyond 2 years post-FIV inoculation. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays of purified peripheral blood lymphocyte populations from cats with chronic experimental or natural FIV infection have revealed that B-lymphocytes are the most frequently infected circulating host cell, with lower infection rates among CD4 + and CD8 + T-lymphocytes (English et al, 1993) . As the numbers of peripheral blood B-lymphocytes and CD8 \u00f7 T-lymphocytes do not significantly change during chronic infection, these host cells are apparently not susceptible to the cytopathic mechanisms involved in CD4 T-lymphocytopenia (Bishop et al, 1993) .\n\nPeripheral blood cytopenias and marrow morphological abnormalities frequently occur during experimental acute FIV infection and during the late, symptomatic stages of chronic infection. The characteristics and frequency of these disorders closely resemble the haematological manifestations of HIV infection, suggesting that the pathogenesis of the marrow suppression associated with both of these related lentiviruses is similar.\n\nNeutropenia (i.e. neutrophil count <2500/~l) develops in a majority of cats inoculated with in vivo and in vitro passaged FIV isolates (Yamamoto et al, 1988; Mandell et al, 1992; Callanan et al, 1992b; Moraillon et al, 1992; George et al, 1993; Linenberger et aL 1994) . Neutropenia usually occurs within 4-8 weeks of inoculation and may persist for 2-18 weeks, with nadir counts ranging from 200-2000cells/txl. Neutropenia is severe (i.e. < 500 cells/~l) in FIV-inoculated neonatal kittens (George et al, 1993) and in cats with pre-existing asymptomatic FeLV infection (Pedersen et al, 1990) . Dually infected cats have more severe clinical signs of primary FIV infection and a higher rate of fatal infections and/or gastrointestinal complications. Significant decreases in the mean circulating eosinophil count have been noted at weeks 6-13 post-inoculation with FIV Petaluma (Mandell et al, 1992) ; however, peripheral blood monocyte counts, platelet counts, and haematocrits are not significantly altered during experimental primary FIV infection (Yamamoto et al, 1988; Mandell et al, 1992; George et al, 1993) .\n\nHistological marrow evaluations during the neutropenic phase of experimental acute FIV infection occasionally reveal myeloid hyperplasia with a shift to immature precursors, lymphoid follicles, and/or marrow lymphocytosis (Pedersen et al, 1990; Beebe et al, 1992; Callanan et al, 1992b , Mandell et al, 1992 . However, serial marrow aspirates on a cohort of inoculated cats failed to detect significantly increased frequencies of marrow lymphocytes, plasma cells, or eosinophils when compared to uninfected control cats (Mandell et al, 1992) .\n\nInfected marrow mononuclear cells and megakaryocytes are detectable by in situ hybridization assays for FIV nucleic acids in histological marrow sections from cats with experimental acute FIV infection (Beebe et al, 1992; Linenberger et al, 1995) . Double-labelling studies have identified some of these mononuclear cells as infected T-lymphocytes and monocyte/ macrophages (Beebe et al, 1993) . High frequencies of infected cells have also been detected in cats with experimental acute FIV infection and pre-existing FeLV infection (Beebe et al, 1992) . As maturing marrow myeloid and erythroid precursors in these sections do not appear to harbour proviral DNA, these lineages apparently are either not major targets of FIV or infected progenitors do not survive to give rise to infected progeny. Marrow buffy coat cells from cats at weeks 4-1.2 post-FIV inoculation produce infectious cell-free virus in culture . Furthermore, indirect immunofluorescence assays for intracytoplasmic FIV CA protein or in situ hybridization assays for FIV nucleic acids identify infected mononuclear and macrophage cells in these cultures. These observations support the hypothesis that marrow accessory cells (monocyte/ macrophages and T-lymphocytes) are targets of FIV during acute infection and that these cells, and/or their extracellular products, may play a role in the pathogenesis of neutropenia.\n\nThe asymptomatic stage of chronic FIV infection lasts from many months to many years and is not usually associated with peripheral blood cytopenias (Shelton et al, 1990a) . The marrow during this stage may contain increased numbers of tymphocytes, plasma cells, or eosinophils, but the myeloid. erythroid, and megakaryocytic lineages mature normally (Shelton et al, 1990a) . Similarly, marrow culture studies on asymptomatic, FIV-seropositive cats with normal peripheral blood counts demonstrate normal frequencies of CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-E, with normal progenitor cell cycle kinetics and in vitro growth responsiveness to haematopoietic growth factors (Linenberger et al, 1991) . In situ hybridization studies of marrow sections and soluble FIV CA antigen assays of marrow buffy coat cell cultures often fail to identify virus-producing cells during this stage of infection (Beebe et al, 1992; Linenberger, unpublished observation) . Thus, haematopoiesis is unperturbed during asymptomatic infection and marrow cell viral replication occurs at only a very low level, if at all. Drug-induced haematological complications may occur more frequently in these animals. For example, severe neutropenia has been reproducibly induced in asymptomatic FIV-seropositive cats but not in seronegative animals by exposure to griseofulvin (Shelton et al, 1990b) . This observation is analogous to the increased sensitivity of HIV-infected individuals to the cytopenic adverse effects of certain drugs. The griseofulvin-induced neutropenia in FIV-infected cats appears to be mediated by binding of antibody or immune complexes to circulating neutrophils, facilitating their clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (Abkowitz, unpublished observation) .\n\nCats suffering from late-stage FIV-related symptoms, including fever, weight loss, persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, neurological disorders, diarrhoea, opportunistic infections, and malignancies, frequently have peripheral blood cytopenias (Hosie et al, 1989; Ishida et al, 1989; Yamamoto et al, 1989; Shelton et al, 1990a; Fleming et al, 1991; Sparkes et al, 1993) . Anaemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia are found in roughly 30, 25, and 6-16%, respectively, of clinically ill FIV-seropositive cats. Anaemia and thrombocytopenia are more common in FIV-infected cats with more severe clinical illness. Coinfection with FeLV produces similar cytopenias but with more frequency than that seen with FIV infection alone (Shelton et al, 1990a) . As these abnormalities occur in cats without coexistent infection with FeLV, Hemobartonella felis, Toxoplasma gondii, and feline coronavirus, FIV and/or factors related to profound late-stage immune dysfunction likely play a direct causal role in marrow suppression. An increased neutrophil count has been noted in 23-35% of FIV-infected cats in some studies, often in association with purulent bacterial infections Fleming et al, 1991; Sparkes et al, 1993) . Thus, FIV-infected animals can mount an appropriate leukaemoid response under some conditions. Similarly, haemolytic anaemia due to Hemobartonella felis infection has been noted in some FIV-infected cats (Sparkes et al, 1993) , demonstrating that appropriate compensatory erythropoiesis can also occur.\n\nMarrow morphological abnormalities are found in 72% of cats with symptomatic FIV-associated illnesses: myeloid and erythroid cell hyperplasia; erythroid megaloblastic maturation abnormalities; infiltration with reactive lymphocytes and plasma cells; and, less commonly, infiltration with neoplastic lymphoid or myeloid cells (most commonly in cats coinfected with FeLV) (Shelton et al, 1990a) . In situ hybridization studies have identified FIV-infected marrow cells in cats with late-stage terminal illnesses, and double-labelling studies have further identified cells as predominantly monocyte/macrophages (Gluckstern et al, 1993) . Late-stage FIV infection therefore appears to be associated with increased virus replication in marrow accessory cells, ineffective haematopoiesis with dysplastic marrow cell maturation, and peripheral blood cytopenias.\n\nChronic infection with FIV is associated with an increased risk of developing lymphoma. A retrospective serological survey revealed an overall adjusted 5.1-fold relative risk of lymphoma in cats infected with FIV, compared to uninfected cats matched for age, sex, geographic location, and time of study (Shelton et al, 1990c) . The relative risks of developing lymphoma in cats infected with FeLV alone, or coinfected with FIV and FeLV were 62.1-fold greater, or 77.3-fold greater, respectively, than controls. The tumours associated with FIV infection were predominately multicentric nodal or extranodal. FIV-associated lymphomas develop in cats at a mean age of 8.7 years old, compared to mean ages of 3.8 or 6.3 years old in cats with lymphomas associated with FeLV infection, or FIV and FeLV coinfection, respectively (Shelton et al, 1990c) . These observations agree with other reports of lymphomas among retrospective surveys of cats with spontaneous FIV infection (Hosie et al, 1989; Ishida et al, 1989; Yamamoto et al, 1989) .\n\nFIV-associated lymphomas differ from FeLV-induced tumours in the anatomical locations involved and the phenotype of the malignant cells. Extranodal sites of tumour involvement are common in FIV seropositive cats. These sites include the liver, kidneys, spleen, and periorbital tissues (Shelton et al, 1990c; Hutson et al, 1991; Callanan et al, 1993) . Similar lymphomas have occurred, albeit rarely, in cats experimentally infected with FIV (Callanan et al, 1992a . Histological, immunophenotypic, and molecular analyses of spontaneous and experimental FIV-associated lymphomas have revealed clonal populations of immunoblastic B-cells . These tumour cells do not harbour FIV provirus, and they do not contain rearrangements of c-myc. In comparison, one turnout in a cat coinfected with FeLV consisted of neoplastic T-cells containing FeLV proviral DNA . Thus, FIV infection appears to predispose cats to clonal outgrowths of malignant B-lymphocytes, similar to the association of lymphomas and HIV infection in man. The pathogenic mechanisms involved in FIV-associated tumorigenesis remain undetermined; impairment of immune surveillance and dysregulation of Blymphopoiesis likely play permissive roles.\n\nMyeloid leukaemia has been rarely diagnosed in FIV seropositive cats Hutson et al, 1991; Sparkes et al, 1993) . There has been one report of myeloid leukaemia developing within 2 months after inoculation of a kitten with FIV Petaluma (Yamamoto et al, 1988) . Other reports of myeloproliferative disorders in FIV seropositive cats involved animals coinfected with FeLV. Collectively, these observations do not strongly support an association between FIV infection and nonlymphoid haematological malignancies. Long-term prospective studies of large cohorts of FIV-infected cats will be required to identify such an association.\n\nProductively-infected marrow T-lymphocytes, monocytic/macrophages, and megakaryocytes are detected during primary and late-stages of FIV infection. In contrast, myeloid and erythroid precursors cells do not appear to be major targets of FIV in vivo. This pattern of host cell range is similar to that of HIV-1, and suggests that FIV-associated marrow suppression is mediated by mechanisms similar to those implicated by studies with HIV. Such mechanisms include suppression of haematopoietic progenitors by marrow accessory cells, accessory cell products, extracellular virus, and/or viral products (Scadden et al, 1989; Louache et al, 1992; Zauli et al, 1992) . However, FIV differs from HIV-1 in some respects, and these differences could relate to additional or alternative mechanisms of marrow suppression. For example, FIV infects a significant number of B-lymphocytes and CD8 + T-lymphocytes in vivo, whereas these host cell phenotypes do not appear to be major targets of HIV in vivo. Thus, these cells may be more directly involved in the pathogenesis of marrow suppression associated with FIV. Other susceptible or infected host cells in the marrow microenvironment could also be important. The broader in vivo host cell range of FIV, compared to HIV, is explained by the recent observations that the major receptor for FIV is not feline CD4 (Norimine et al, 1993) but rather a 24 kDa protein (Willett et al, 1994) . The putative FIV receptor is constitutively expressed on susceptible cell lines, neutrophils, macrophages, and astro-cytes, and it is inducible on T-lymphocytes by Con A and IL-2 exposure . Although this receptor is expressed on neutrophils, these cells are not infected with FIV, suggesting that additional factors likely are involved in virus entry and/or integration. Receptor-bearing cells in the marrow could be affected by interactions with extracellular FIV or the SU protein, without virus entry and integration, analogous to the effect of HIV env proteins on human marrow progenitor and accessory cells (Sugiura et al, 1992; Zauli et al, 1992) .\n\nFIV-induced marrow suppression could be related to dysregulation of cytokine production in the marrow microenvironment. Peritoneal macrophages from FIV-infected cats have an impaired ability to produce interleukin-lfollowing LPS stimulation (Lin and Bowman, 1992) , suggesting that the haematopoietic-supporting function of these cells in the marrow could also be compromised. Some studies have detected increased levels of plasma TNFtx in cats with experimental acute FIV infection (Lawrence et al, 1992) and increased levels of plasma interleukin-6-1ike activity in cats with chronic natural FIV infection (Ohashi et al, 1992) . In vitro, TNFoLinhibits the growth of feline haematopoietic progenitors (Khan et al, 1992) . TNFe~ also enhances apoptotic death of FIV-infected fibroblastic cells in culture (Ohno et al, 1993) . Thus, inflammatory mediators may contribute to marrow suppression by adversely affecting progenitor survival or growth or by enhancing the cytocidal effects of FIV in infected marrow accessory cells.\n\nStudies of haematopoiesis during the asymptomatic stage of natural FIV infection reveal no abnormalities in haematopoietic progenitor frequencies, cell cycle kinetics, and in vitro growth characteristics. In addition, sera from these cats do not contain progenitor growth inhibitory activity or complement-fixing antibodies that recognize progenitors (Linenberger et al, 1991) . These observations concur with others (see above) that suggest that progenitors are not major targets of FIV and that factors associated with high levels of virus expression and/or progressive immune dysfunction likely play significant roles in marrow suppression during primary or late-stage infections. Long-term follow-up studies of a cohort of naturally FIV infected cats showed that peripheral neutrophil and lymphocyte counts gradually decrease over time and that episodes of transient neutropenia are occasionally seen (Shelton et al, 1994) . In marrow culture studies on these cats, the frequencies of BFU-E were significantly decreased with long-term asymptomatic infection, but the in vitro growth response of the BFU-E to exogenous colony-stimulating activity, or to autologous or normal cat sera, was unperturbed. These resemble the decreased erythroid progenitor frequencies seen in asymptomatic HIV seropositive patients (Bagnara et al, 1990) , and suggest that these progenitors are more susceptible to the marrow suppressive mechanisms associated with chronic lentivirus infection.\n\nComprehensive studies of haematopoiesis in cats with symptomatic latestage natural FIV infection have not been performed. One cat with chronic FIV infection, weight loss, severe lymphopenia, and persistent neutropenia was found to have an inhibitory activity in the serum that suppressed the in vitro growth of autologous CFU-GM, but not erythroid progenitors (Shelton et al, 1989b) . This activity was not mediated by an antibody, and it only weakly inhibited the growth of normal cat CFU-GM. Because frequency of progenitors were not altered in the marrow of this cat, this inhibitory activity likely impaired the proliferation or differentiation of the CFU-GM progeny.\n\nA number of marrow abnormalities occur during the period of peripheral blood neutropenia and high levels of virus replication in cats with experimentally induced acute FIV infection . Frequencies of marrow CFU-E, BFU-E, and CFU-GM are significantly increased at weeks 1.5--4 post-inoculation but uniformly depressed at weeks 6-12, when neutropenia occurs. In addition, the percentages of progenitors in the DNA-synthetic phase of the cell cycle are frequently high at weeks 6-12 post-inoculation. Sera from cats at weeks 4-12 post-inoculation frequently contain activity that inhibits the in vitro growth of autologous CFU-GM, whereas progenitor inhibitory activity is not found in sera of cats at weeks 1.5 or 3 post-inoculation. These progenitor and serum changes correlate with the appearance of productively FIV-infected accessory cells in the marrow and peak levels of viraemia. Thus, virus, viral antigens, accessory cells, and/or accessory cell products may mediate the suppression of progenitor growth and/or viability, resulting in the transient neutropenia. Anaemia is not seen in this setting, probably because of the long life-span of erythrocytes and the absence of factors that shorten red cell survival, like haemolysis and haemorrhage. As these abnormalities mimic those seen in late stages of FIV and also HIV infections (when cytopenias and high levels of virus replication also occur), further studies of haematopoiesis during acute FIV infection could provide insights to the viral and host cell factors important in marrow suppression associated with chronic lentivirus infection.\n\nFeline oncornavirus and lentivirus infections have provided useful models to characterize the virus and host cell factors involved in a variety of marrow suppressive disorders and haematological malignancies. Exciting recent progress has been made in the characterization of the viral genotypic features involved in FeLV-associated diseases. Molecular studies have clearly defined the causal role of variant FeLV env gene determinants in two disorders: the T-lymphocyte cytopathicity and the clinical acute immunosuppression induced by the FeLV-FAIDS variant and the pure red cell aptasia induced by FeLV-C/Sarma. Variant or enFeLV env sequences also appear to play a role in FeLV-associated lymphomas. Additional studies are required to determine the host cell processes that are perturbed by these variant env gene products. In the case of the FeLV-FAIDS variant, the aberrant env gene products appear to impair superinfection interference, resulting in accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA and cell death. In other cases it is likely that the viral env proteins interact with host products that are important in cell viability and/or proliferation. Understanding of these mechanisms will therefore provide insights to factors involved in normal lymphohaematopoiesis. Similarly, studies of FeLV-induced haematological neoplasms should reveal recombination or rearrangement events involving as yet unidentified host gene sequences that encode products involved in normal cell growth regulation. These sequences may include novel protooncogenes or sequences homologous to genes implicated in human haematological malignancies.\n\nThe haematological consequences of FIV are quite similar to those associated with HIV. As with HIV, HV does not appear to directly infect myeloid or erythroid precursors, and the mechanisms of marrow suppression likely involve virus, viral antigen, and/or infected accessory cells in the marrow microenvironment. Studies using in vitro experimental models are required to define the effects of each of these microenvironmental elements on haematopoietic progenitors. As little is known about the molecular mechanisms of FIV pathogenesis, additional studies of disease-inducing FIV strains are needed to identify the genotypic features that correlate with virulent phenotypic features. Finally, experimental FIV infection in cats provides the opportunity to correlate in vivo virological and haematological changes with in vitro observations in a large animal model that closely mimics HIV infection in man."}
